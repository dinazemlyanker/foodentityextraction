Parikh has thought about her parents\u2019 business a lot\u2014a community place where customers became her surrogate babysitters\u2014as she launched Mina\u2019s World, what she says is Philadelphia\u2019s first-ever QTPOC-owned and -operated coffee shop.Named after Parikh\u2019s cat that she parents with her partner and co-owner, Kate Egghart, the coffee shop doubles as a community hub. It\u2019s a spot to find home goods made by local artists and pick up snacks and drinks that nod to Parikh and Egghart\u2019s combined Indian and Korean roots (chai with rose syrup, yuja-cha, and samosas). Soon they\u2019ll roll out a specialty drink inspired by the Brazilian heritage of Paula Cooke, their manager of operations. Handmade, thoughtful touches dot the space, from the daffodil yellow hand-tiling that Egghart helped design and inlay, to the custom cow print ceramic tip jar made by artists Bee Daddy & Sons with Scott Cooper.But Mina\u2019s World is about more than just drinks and decor. It seeks to be an alternate kind of coffee shop in Philly: one that pays its employees fairly, has Black and Brown employees in managerial positions, prioritizes ethical sourcing when it comes to its coffee beans, and never turns away a customer (\u201cWhile we only accept credit cards right now because of the pandemic, we heavily disagree with operating cashless. That rules out an entire group of people who probably need a hot meal more than most,\u201d says Parikh, who currently gives free coffee and meals to those without a card on hand). These tenets seem basic, but they\u2019re radical in an era where so many new coffee shops can feel generic and exclusionary, their sterile, modernist aesthetics attracting a mostly white, wealthy customer base.The West Philadelphia coffee spot\u2014located on the corridor of 52nd Street\u2014had been open only 18 days before COVID-19 shut down the city in mid-March. And though they weren\u2019t able to use the space as a comfy, welcoming hangout spot for people of marginalized identities, the feeling of a more equitable form of community has remained palpable and pleasurable, as seen with their to-go baggies with Sharpie drawings of cats. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any investors, so the odds are stacked so far against you running a business like this. But I would be a fool to think that I am generating this community myself. It takes a lot of trust and people to make this work,\u201d she tells me. Below, Parikh breaks down how she and her team developed such a unique sense of place.The drinks start at $2.\nTiayrra BradleyThoughtfully sourced coffee with a message\u201cI have worked in coffee since I was 18. Most of the workplaces were really toxic in the sense that the workers were not being paid well and the white ownership neglected to protect their Black and trans employees. I knew there needed to be a space where you could have an amazingly made cup of coffee that\u2019s not whitewashed. We use Passenger Coffee, based in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, for both our high-quality beans and our chai\u2014they source with integrity, making sure their farmers are consistently bought from and not just dropped after one big sale or crop. The whole point of Mina\u2019s is empowering Black and Brown people, and that means those who are doing the labor are also treated with that same level of respect. We\u2019re working all the time on making accessible price points. That\u2019s why drip coffee is $2 a cup\u2014we don\u2019t make a profit from it.\u201dEgghart helped design and inlay the cheerful yellow tiling.\nTiayrra BradleyA stocked community fridge\u201cInspired by other community fridge efforts, we have a fridge that anyone can take from outside of Mina\u2019s World. As the hosts, we pay for the electric and for its upkeep. I\u2019m a volunteer of the fridge, and that means cleaning it rigorously at night\u2014but it\u2019s an autonomous effort led by West Philadelphia for Philadelphia. We had to make a water-safe home for it, which involved fundraising and building out a hutch.\u201cMy father recently died of COVID-19\u2014which is a very cruel, isolated way to die\u2014but afterward, we found out what a food justice warrior he was; people showed up telling us how he used food to help others. As people growing up on food stamps, my family didn\u2019t necessarily have the academic or social titles for something like naming what we were experiencing to be a community fridge, but we knew where to pick up donated items. I feel so lucky to continue that here.\u201dA few of Mina\u2019s World\u2019s offerings: Yuzu honey iced tea, pistachio rose cookie, rose iced chai, brownies, green grape lemonade, and an oatmeal cream pie.\nTiayrra BradleySamosas and GF donuts\u201cA lot of the baked goods available at Mina\u2019s World are accidentally vegan. We have a whole cross section of customers and we didn\u2019t want to emphasize the vegan-ness of things, but just leave it to be something natural without the label on the menu. We have oatmeal cream pies, pistachio-rose sugar cookies, and blueberry coffee cake from a local bakery called Crust. The gluten-free doughnuts are from OkieDokie.\u201cWe have a lot of things on our menu that we were once ridiculed for eating as kids, that we wanted to make relevant to the store and more accessible. I\u2019m really excited about our samosas. We get them from this Auntie who makes them out of an Indian grocery store called International Foods and Spices. We\u2019re also working with some food organizations to roll out a breakfast menu made from local ingredients in the next year.\u201dA locally made coloring book available for purchase.\nTiayrra BradleyBooks from local authors\u201cWe\u2019re selling Praise to the Lesser Gods of Love\u2014it\u2019s a poetry book by a local writer named Noor Ibn Najam, who impacts our writing community. We had a vision of having a library for people to flip through while they drank coffee and relaxed. Currently, we also have adult coloring books for sale that feature subjects like natural hair care.\u201dBuy them: Book prices vary.Tinctures to improve your mood\u201cWe offer small-batch herbal tinctures from Root2Star herbals. We especially like the Tender Heart one which is for people experiencing grief, loss, and sadness\u2014so relevant right now.\u201dBuy it: Tender heart tincture, $12.Of course the merch includes a tote.\nTiayrra BradleyRep the space with limited-edition merch that you\u2019ll want to collect\u201cPart of being a small business owner is respecting and supporting local artists. We have tote bags and a few different T-shirts for sale that were made for Mina\u2019s World as well as mugs, key chains, stickers, and planners. We\u2019re hoping to have work from our employees featured too.\u201dBuy them: Bayaht Ham\u2019s Mina's World Shirt, $15 (a bulk of the sales go to Morris Home); Tote bags, $12 (made by local tattoo artist, Big Baby Pokes).Bring home a snack for later\u201cRight now, we really love Palm Breeze Simply Natural, which supplies us with fresh-squeezed juice. We also have nori snacks and Nong Shim Shin Cup, a brand of Korean ramyun that\u2019s prominently featured in mukbang videos. We offer it both as a dry packaged good or we\u2019ll make it for people to-go\u2014it\u2019s a nice low-cost option.\u201dBuy it: Palm Breeze juices, $6.50.Explore Bon App\u00e9titPhiladelphiaHealthyishRead MoreLifestyleInside Queens, San Francisco's Expertly Curated Korean-American SuperetteGallery5 SlidesBy Elena KadvanyRecipes you want to make.
