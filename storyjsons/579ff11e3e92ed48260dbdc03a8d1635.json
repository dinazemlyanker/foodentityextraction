Few meals are as satisfying to whip up as slabs of eggplant parm, a sheet of strawberry snacking cake, or any other dish that comes together in a single 9x13\" pan. There\u2019s only one problem: Though my heart wants to bake for a small town\u2019s worth of folks, I live in a household of two, and there is only so much baked ziti and custardy French toast that my husband and I can eat. My love of casseroles was a curse until I met my new kitchenware MVP.This cute, small Sweejar baking dish is designed for your cute, small, tray bake-loving households. Small but sturdy, the ceramic casserole is not only dishwasher safe, but it also comes in an array of darling colors, like buttery yellow and cherry red. (And if you want all your baking dishes to color coordinate, pick up this nesting set.) In its miniature glory, this 5x6.5\" dish allows me to bake casseroles perfectly portioned for two. And before you ask, when scaling down a recipe that calls for a 9x13\" baking dish, just divide by four, which yields enough to fill the wee Sweejar with a little bit left over. My small baking dish also frees me to experiment and throw together inspired, small-scale, recipes on a whim\u2014all safeguarded by the knowledge that if my creation isn\u2019t a hit, I haven\u2019t wasted a ton of ingredients.Sometimes I simply can\u2019t go on without a bite of warm, homemade blondies or ooey gooey butter cake. But does that mean I want an entire sheet of it in my fridge? That\u2019s where I thank my petite baking dish for satiating my identically petite but URGENT cravings. And with fall around the corner, I\u2019m counting down the days until I can snuggle up in a blanket on the couch and eat a single serving of chicken pot pie straight from my small-enough-to-hold casserole dish. Now that\u2019s what my heart really wants.Photo by Isa Zapata, food styling by Kat BoystovaSweejar Mini Baking Dish$16 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make.
