Though definitely not halal, spike it with a splash of liqueur (Cardamaro, Lillet, sambuca, even peach schnapps would be nice), or keep it nonalcoholic with a light honey syrup instead. This recipe is part of Sohla\u2019s Thanksgiving-for-two-or-maybe-eight feast, see the full menu here.Ingredients6 Servings3bags chamomile tea1cup mixed dried fruit (such as apricots, figs, prunes, and/or cranberries), pits removed if needed, cut into \u00bd\"\u20131\" pieces if large\u2153cup honey (optional)Floral, fruit, or spiced liqueur (such as St-Germain, arak, Cardamaro, or sambuca; for serving; optional)PreparationStep 1Place tea bags and fruit in a heatproof pitcher or large measuring glass or jar and pour 4 cups boiling water over.

Highly recommend.AnonymousKilchberg, Switzerland12/3/2020A delicious fruity drink! As a Muslim, I think it\u2019s perfectly fine that the recipe includes an optional alcoholic version bc its stated that it\u2019s not obviously not halal (also, plenty of Muslims are lax about eating halal and DO drink alcohol anyway). Will make this drink again. Sasa New York11/16/2020I think you need to be more respectful of Ramadhan and not associate it with a recipe that has optional alcohol, which is antithetical, regardless of your mention that it is not halal. Ramadhan is a religious observation, and should not be mentioned/discussed in the same space as alcohol, keep them separate.
