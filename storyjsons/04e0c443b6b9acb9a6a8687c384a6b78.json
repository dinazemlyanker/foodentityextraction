When the pandemic hit earlier this year, Seattle was one of the first U.S. cities to see its restaurant industry grind to a halt. But it wasn\u2019t just its restaurants that suffered; it was all the suppliers who rely on them. For Archipelago, the domino effect was vast, as evidenced by the network involved in creating a single dish, their Anak Ni Bet (pictured above). Derived from a classic Ilokano dish called pinakbet, it usually includes bitter melon, squash, and eggplant. In this version the ingredients change seasonally. See how the virus\u2019s ripple effect plays out below.Illustration by Steve GavanBarrel-Aged Apple Cider Vinegar from Alpenfire Cider in Port Townsend, WA\u201cWe have scaled back production, so the cider is just sitting,\u201d co-owner Philippe Bishop says. But there\u2019s a silver lining: \u201cWe found that with the type of apples we are using, letting them mature longer in bulk actually enhances the flavor of the final product.\u201d\u00a0Apples from Luckiamute River Farm in Kings Valley, ORCo-owner Rachel Ashley was worried she wasn\u2019t going to be able to sell most of her apples this year.

To make ends meet he\u2019s now connecting his restaurant partners with other local producers, like farmers and butchers. The chefs order directly from the producer, and Key City Fish handles the delivery.Seafood from New Day Fisheries in Port Townsend, WAThe market conditions have been \u201cchallenging\u201d but are slowly improving, owner and third-generation fisherman Scott Kimmel says.

On the plus side, she says, it has been a good year for selling crops. \u201cThere is a renewed interest in buying local and a deeper understanding of how fragile the food system is.\u201dSquash seeds from Osborne Quality Seeds in Mount Vernon, WASales rep Linda Fenstermaker was inundated with calls from home gardeners wanting to buy seeds, even though Osborne sells mostly to commercial growers. \u201cIt was exciting to get so many new growers,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it will be interesting to see next year how many people come back.\u201dIllustration by Steve GavanCeramic Bowl from Lexa Luna Studio in Seattle\u201cBefore the pandemic, I relied a lot on in-person markets,\u201d founder Alexa Villanueva says. \u201cThe pandemic has forced me to get creative in how I share my process, like creating videos for Instagram (@lexalunastudio).\u201dClay from Clay Art Center in Tacoma, WA\u201cSixty percent of our income is tied to the public education system,\u201d owner Quinn Bougher says, referring to the center\u2019s art classes. \u201cTraditionally, our slow period is summer. This year it started in March, when we closed our showroom.\u201d To control costs they\u2019ve bought fewer materials and pivoted to curbside service.Illustration by Steve GavanChanterelles from Foraged & Found Edibles in SeattleForaged & Found used to sell primarily to restaurants; now it has shifted to retail.
