This is it.By Marissa A. RossNovember 14, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailThis is the part when I\u2019m supposed to recommend easy-drinking Pinot Noir or Gamay because it\u2019s Thanksgiving. But this year I\u2019m not. With wine you can veer from tradition a bit more easily than the time you snuck jalapen\u0303o into the cornbread stuffing and Aunt Annette nearly had an aneurysm. So let me introduce you to the Thanksgiving wine of 2018: Poulsard.Poulsard (sometimes spelled Ploussard) is a lesser-known but totally delicious red wine from France\u2019s Jura region. For years the grape was mostly used for blends because its light body and pale color weren\u2019t as \u201cpowerful\u201d as other French red varieties, the equivalent of always being seated at the kids\u2019 table because your politics aren\u2019t \u201cstrong\u201d enough for the grown-ups\u2019.It\u2019s cloudy garnet in color, echoing the crimson cranberry sauce across the table. It pairs well with everything from turkey to vegducken without freaking out anyone or distracting from the precious (and jalapen\u0303o-free) stuffing. It smells like a walk down a pine-lined hometown street, past a berry bramble, leaves crunching underfoot. A sip will bring you back to life with a shock of cherry, pomegranate, and strawberry. It finishes like a smoky cedar plank with a hint of red currant and that one chair (every family has one).But what makes Poulsard such a special holiday wine is that it\u2019s unexpected; it sparks a new conversation. If Thanksgiving is the ultimate excuse to eat too much in good company, Poulsard is all the justification you need to linger around the table and open up another bottle\u2014or several.Now get some recipes to serve with that wine:1 / 69ChevronChevronSpatchcocked Turkey with Anise and OrangeView RecipeRead MorecultureThe One Time I Actually Cooked a Thanksgiving Meal On ThanksgivingBy Chris Moroccoculture7 Simple Rules for Mastering the Thanksgiving PotluckBy Sarah JampelRecipes you want to make.
