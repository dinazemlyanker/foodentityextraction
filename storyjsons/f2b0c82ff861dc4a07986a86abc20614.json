But now, in my tiny apartment kitchen, flavored coffee is undergoing a renaissance. I\u2019m not talking about the bags of \u201ccaramel\u201d grinds that leave a sort of soapy residue on the roof of your mouth. No, I\u2019m talking about\u2014endorsing, even\u2014the simple act of adding spices to your coffee grounds.While adding spices to coffee has been a common practice for decades, if not centuries, in many parts of the world, including Morocco and Mexico, I first learned about it from my friend Maddie. One morning late last year, I woke up on the lofted bed in her living room to the unmistakable sound of whole beans jostling around in a bag. From my perch I watched her add them to a grinder followed by a few shakes of cinnamon and a pinch of salt (!). I thought I must be dreaming, until the guttural roar of shattering coffee beans woke me. I took a sip from the ceramic mug she handed over, and I\u2019m telling you it was transcendent\u2014like walking into a sunny clearing after a long hike through thick woods.Photo by Emma FishmanBurlap & Barrel Cinnamon$8 at Burlap & Barrel$9 at HiveI\u2019ve obviously dumped as much stale cinnamon into my Starbucks orders as the next guy, but unlike those times, there were no weird, grainy floaties in my brew. And the addition of salt cut the perceived bitterness and acidity of the coffee and, much like it does in baked goods, amped up the sweet, floral flavor. Spicy coffee, as I\u2019ve come to call it, is now the only way I\u2019ll take my cuppa joe.Here\u2019s how to add spices to your coffee:If you are decidedly not a morning person ( \u270b), just add a sprinkle of preground spices directly into your French press, Chemex, Mr. Coffee\u2014choose your own adventure\u2014along with the ground beans. For the naturally peppy among us, you might prefer adding whole (as in, not ground) spices in with your whole beans and grinding them together. This will result in a more fragrant, aromatic brew, but be warned: Your bean grinder will likely hold on to those flavors and potentially infuse them into your next batch. Whichever route you choose, once the coffee and spices are combined, add a pinch of salt (though you might want to skip it if you love coffee\u2019s bitterness), and continue to brew as normal.Warmer spices\u2014the ones you\u2019d reach for when baking\u2014like cardamom, allspice, cloves, ginger, nutmeg, star anise, and cinnamon pair particularly well with coffee. Senior cooking editor Sarah Jampel loves New York Shuk\u2019s Kafe Hawaij, a spice blend that was brought to Israel from Yemen and is traditionally used in fresh coffee. I\u2019ll grind a tablespoon of cacao nibs with my coffee beans for a darker take on a mocha. And though it sounds a pinch deranged to me personally, people I don\u2019t know on the internet have reportedly enjoyed adding dried culinary lavender to their grinds. (You do you.)DIOGRAFICKafe Hawaij$9.95 at New York ShukWhatever you choose, know that a little spice goes a long way; my rule of thumb is \u00bd teaspoon ground spice per six cups of coffee. The best way to find what you like is to experiment with intensity and try to emulate your favorite baked goods (lookin\u2019 at you pumpkin bread) in coffee form.While I\u2019ve admittedly left the choppy mullet cut (moo-lay, as we used to pronounce it) back in my university days alongside literally everything I learned at journalism school, I\u2019m delighted that fun, flavorful beverages are back in my life. Like a spicy coffee, I should have enjoyed those years while they lasted.More highly caffeinated content from BA\u2019s Coffee Week:The Best Ways to Make Coffee, According to BaristasThis Reusable Coffee Filter Means I Never Worry About Running OutThe Coffee to Water Ratio That Makes a Perfect BrewThis Flash-Frozen Concentrate Is Revolutionizing the Way I Drink CoffeeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
