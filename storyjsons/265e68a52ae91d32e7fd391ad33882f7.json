It's exactly what all households need ALWAYS! I prefer it thicker, so I double the tomato paste & nix the juice from the can (I save the juice for sauce!) but the flavor is on point.AnonymousNew Jersey4/15/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titCondimentJamSpreadsAmericanCanned TomatoTomatoVegetableCinnamonHerbs & SpicesEasySideDairy-FreeNut-FreeVeganVegetarianGluten-FreeSimmerRecipes you want to make.
