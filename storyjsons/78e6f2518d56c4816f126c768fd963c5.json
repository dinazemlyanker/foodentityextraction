Over It!The only turkey recipe you need, an apple with pink (!) flesh, and more food news from the week.By Alex BeggsNovember 17, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by American Stock/Getty ImagesFacebookTwitterEmailEvery Friday morning, Bon App\u00e9tit senior staff writer Alex Beggs shares weekly highlights from the BA office, from awesome new recipes to office drama to restaurant recs, with some weird (food!) stuff she saw on the internet thrown in. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.The countdown to turkey timeLet me guess. *Waves hand over crystal ball that\u2019s actually an onion on a plate. * You hate the taste of dry, rubbery, bland turkey. Yet it feels inevitable. As if the universe pre-determines it\u2014like the delayed flight that has you sitting on the tarmac for two hours every year. But no! Not this year, folks. This year the dry brine is going to save us all. Andy Baraghani, who \u201cwon the Oscar\u201d aka was assigned the turkey recipe for the Thanksgiving issue, has a simple salt and sugar mix that you rub all over the bird a day before roast time and it results in juicy, skin-crackling goodness. (Don\u2019t forget a side of Andy\u2019s umami gravy, too.) Don\u2019t ask about a wet brine\u2013it waterlogs your bird, makes a watery mess, and we\u2019re over it. Over it!Get the recipe:Dry-Rubbed Roast TurkeyOur never-fail turkey is excellent in every way that every other turkeys often fall short. Period.View RecipeWant this letter before it hits the website?

Last year, I brought a beautiful radicchio salad with honey vinaigrette to my friend Justin\u2019s Thanksgiving feast (he smokes a turkey in his Big Green Egg\u2014epic), and NO ONE ATE IT. A huge bowl of perfectly dressed leaves was left untouched, as if it was decorative purple potpourri. Even I didn\u2019t have room on my plate and had prioritized green bean casserole for my obligatory vegetable. So this year, I\u2019M NOT MAKING A SALAD. However\u2026this new recipe with sour cream ranch (*swoons *) is incredible and I\u2019m making it for a dinner party this pre-T weekend, along with a big roast beef (recipe coming soon!).Get the recipe:Radicchio Salad with Sour Cream RanchWith salty, sweet, and creamy components, this recipe is more than just a salad: It's a fully realized side dish.View RecipeLolArt newsEdward Hopper (1882-1967), Chop Suey, 1929.Edward Hopper\u2019s 1929 painting \u201cChop Suey\u201d (of me and my friend Laura talking about where to find the cheapest therapy while waiting for our dinner check) sold for $91.9 MILLION.\u201cReally, $100 million for a Hopper? I don\u2019t know how they come up with these valuations,\u201d Howard Rehs, a New York gallerist who presumably never orders the chicken because he can make that at home, told the New York Times. Art historians like Judith A. Barter point out that none of Hopper\u2019s paintings in restaurants and diners actually contain food. She told Christie\u2019s the artist was \u201cfamously uninterested in food, Hopper and his wife often made dinner from canned ingredients. What he found important were the spaces where eating and drinking took place.\u201d $91.9 million is a lot of baked beans!Favorite pizza toppingsThis week, Christina Chaey sent me a screenshot as she applied to be a United Airlines MileagePlus member \u201cof course.\u201d One security question was, bafflingly, \u201cwhat is your favorite pizza topping?\u201d and the options revealed an underside of the American public that usually lives in the shadows. Who are these people with MASHED POTATOES on their pizza? Shrimp is an option but not CLAMS?? Where in the Sam Hill are the anchovies??? Zucchini is too watery for pizza! \u201cI\u2019ll take a half za\u2019atar, half prawn,\u201d SAID NO ONE. I don\u2019t know about you, but this security question leaves me feeling more unsafe than ever.Overheard at BA:\u201cWhy didn't you do the over-under?\u201d That was Adam Rapoport asking Rachel Karten why her stunning lattice-crust cranberry tart wasn\u2019t properly latticed, which is because it\u2019s more of a cookie dough, not pie, with pecans that make it hard to maneuver. We booed and hissed and sent him away\u2014it was a BEAUTIFUL lattice. Even Claire commented, \u201cShe is PERFECT.\u201d Has Adam ever made a tart? NO. (Note about this recipe: you can cover all kinds of mistakes, like cracks in dough and improper lattices, with a dusting of powdered sugar. It looks elaborate but it\u2019s more accessible than you think. And so tangy! We ate it for breakfast.)Get the recipe:Cranberry Linzer TartInside two layers of buttery, crumbly walnut crust hides a tart cranberry filling.View RecipeInnovations in applesThis week we got a box of HIDDEN ROSE apples all the way from Oregon, a crazy variety that\u2019s yellow-red ish on the outside, like a leaf in transition, and BRIGHT MAGENTA inside. \u201cI thought you were holding a bloody steak,\u201d said Alex Delany when he saw me chomping into one from across a room. \u201cOr a bloody heart!\u201d someone else morbidly noted. They\u2019re pretty normal apple tasting, like a Fuji, with a hint of lemon and watermelon Sour Patch, though a little mealy inside. They\u2019d had a cross-country trek, after all. \u201cA glamour apple,\u201d quoth Amiel Stanek.ALEX LAUUnnecessary food feud of the weekAt 5:58 p.m. on Tuesday, Molly Baz waltzed down our row of cubicles with a chicken pot pie in one hand, a tub of Vaseline in the other. \u201cThat's for lubin\u2019 up your lips because you'll be smackin \u2018em so much,\u201d she announced. A debate broke out about whether she should use turnips or carrots in the upcoming Basically recipe\u2014this initial version had turnips. Team carrots wanted them for color, and because it\u2019s a more common ingredient. Team turnips didn\u2019t want the sweetness from carrots, and wanted turnips to get their due. Carla Lalli Music declared, \u201cTurnips? That\u2019s food for rabbits. No one actually likes turnips. They make you gassy.\u201d Chris Morocco told Molly he prefers daikon, which Molly huffed \u201cisn\u2019t even a turnip! That\u2019s a radish!\u201d Alex Delany thinks Basically readers are more likely to cook with carrots than turnips; he shook his head and walked away. Chaey announced, \u201cTurnips aren\u2019t basic,\u201d and then whispered that she still prefers them. Someone said, \u201cFree the \u2019nip!\u201d I just kept repeating the word \u201cturnip!\u201d intermittently hoping to influence people subliminally. Elyse Inamine noted that turnips helped soak up the pot pie\u2019s creamy goodness better than carrots would. And guess what. TURNIPS WON. \u201cIt's not about not liking turnips,\u201d Molly explained, \u201cit\u2019s about whether they belong in pot pie.\u201d And they certainly DO.
