If you want something a little heftier, these beans are the ideal mate for a variety of add-ins. You could stir some shrimp in during the last few minutes of cooking, nestle a salmon fillet into the beans during the final 7\u201310 minutes in the oven, or toss in loads of baby kale, letting the residual heat wilt the greens, and top with jammy 6-minute eggs. If you can\u2019t find jarred gigante or corona beans, make it a choose-your-own-bean adventure\u2014cannellini, borlotti, navy, or chickpeas are good. If you can\u2019t find spring onions, try doubling up on the leeks or using whole scallions (don\u2019t halve them). \u2014Asha LoupyAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Added two salmon fillets in the last eight minutes as recommended...absolutely sublime!DNHonolulu, HI11/15/2021It was too bitter for us and I even added chicken stock to make it more broth-y. Maybe my lemons were just extra sour? They were on the larger side...AnonymousBrooklyn, NY10/26/2021I've made this about a 1/2 dozen or more time now and I find adding some \"better than bullion chicken flavor\" with some water - about 1/3 cup, and some more EVOO, and a pat of butter BEFORE putting it into the oven yields amazing results. Creamy and rich beans in a sublime 'gravy'. Yum. \nShazzizNYC9/14/2021SO GOODAnonymous8/5/2021I didn't expect to be blown away by beans on toast. I thought it would be a perfectly fine dinner. I added shrimp as suggested for a heartier meal and served over a griddled piece of toast from a loaf I bought from a bakery a day or two prior. It was so so good. Will make this again for sure. My husband couldn't stop raving over it. DanielleSan Francisco, CA6/24/2021Great recipe! Next time I may separate the leeks after they bake, as I found myself doing that anyway to smush them onto bread\u2026 forgot the herbs at the end, but eating it now with some good bread and a jammy egg! Delicious!Kate L.New Orleans, LA6/21/2021This one didn't do it for me. It's possible that the beans I used weren't the best option (Greek giant beans) but they didn't cook all the way through and I ended up wasting the whole dish. The saffron was a first for me and I enjoyed the flavor but was disappointed to have wasted it on this dish. This was the first time I made a recipe I didn't like from basically.AshleyNew York, NY6/10/2021Loved this!! My husband gave it a 10 and that is not a rating given easily! Used leek, green onion and a bulb of garlic. I also used a generous pinch of saffron after reading another's review. Towards the last 10 minutes of cooking, I stirred in thin ribbons of dino kale and then nestled a large salmon fillet in the middle between the confit. Gorgeous, luxurious texture of all items, and perfectly done salmon. A winner!!Steffanie San Rafael, CA6/4/2021This was fabulous! \nWe had to use a head of garlic as garlic stem are not readily available here. The only suggestions I would make are a) use preserved lemons instead of regular lemons. Cut back on the lemons overall and some of the salt as well as preserved lemons are more intense and saltier than plain lemons. Also, if using a head of garlic instead of garlic stems, I would give the garlic head a head start in terms of roasting. I did feel that the saffron got lost somewhat. I might consider adding a little heat with some Aleppo peppers or Urfa Biber instead of saffron. \nBut I just always want to fiddle with a recipe. This recipe as written was fabulous.nlbknitterSan Francisco Bay Area6/3/2021These were genuinely the best beans I've had in my life and really easy as well! Substituted the dill for tarragon and served them spooned over a white risotto and it was perfect.EllieCambridge, UK6/2/2021incredible. worth the work. Anonymous5/24/2021Had great success with this one! Didn't use garlic heads (housemate is allergic) or the saffron (too expensive for me), also added some fennel seeds in stage 5 (just because). Tasted fantastic with some nice bread! One piece of advice, this recipe was just enough for two people, if you're cooking for more consider upping the recipe.DarcyMelbourne, Australia5/18/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaffronHerbs & SpicesLemonCitrusFruitWhite BeanBeanVegetableLeekSpring OnionOnionGarlicSpringSideMainDairy-FreeNut-FreeVeganVegetarianDinnerBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
