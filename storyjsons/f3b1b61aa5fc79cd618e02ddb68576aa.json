I can make basic conversation or finagle directions to the nearest train or bathroom, but I also basically flunked out of Korean language school. The last K-drama I watched was Stairway to Heaven (it came out in 2003), and for all I know, BTS may as well be One Direction.Growing up, my appetite mirrored this too. It took decades for me to take an interest in actually learning how to cook Korean food; as a kid, I was far more interested in watching Ina Garten make \u201cengagement chicken\u201d than I was in watching my mom make kimchi jjigae. I reluctantly ate her fermented soybean paste stew and seaweed soup for dinner, all the while pining for pasta night, hard-shell taco night, frozen French bread pizza night\u2014anything but Korean, because that was boring. I figured the jjigaes, banchan, and kimchi would always be there, waiting for me until the rare occasion that a true craving for them struck.What sane human could resist this deliciousness?\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Susie Theodorou, Prop Styling by Ayesha PatelIt wasn\u2019t until I started cooking for myself that, surprisingly, I found myself missing the earthy nuttiness of the soybean paste stew called doenjang jjigae, and the funky heat of a pot of kimchi jjigae brimming with soft slices of tofu. As an adult, I constantly crave the flavors of the food I so unwittingly took for granted. I\u2019ve since gone on to cook, both professionally and at home, but I've also realized I know relatively little about the core techniques behind the warming, incredibly flavorful Korean soups and stews I want to eat all the time, particularly in the dead of winter.My desire to immerse myself in Korean cooking is what led me to call up chef Sohui Kim, who owns two wonderful restaurants in Brooklyn (Insa and Good Fork) and who has had a similar journey of first pushing aside, and then eventually embracing, the food of our culture. She even ended up writing an entire cookbook about it, called Korean Home Cooking, which came out this past fall.Chef Sohui Kim, in the lounge at Insa.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanI proposed we spend a day cooking our way through her versions of my all-time favorite childhood dishes; you can find all of those recipes in the March issue of Bon App\u00e9tit, as well as right here. She showed me how to bump up the flavor of a classic kimchi stew with a spoonful of gochujang, the fermented red pepper paste. She taught me how to make her take on kalbi jjim, the soy-braised short ribs I only get to eat once a year on my birthday when my grandma makes them for me, and which Sohui makes with the very nontraditional (and very delicious addition) of red wine. I had always assumed this style of cooking was too fussy or time-intensive but, as Sohui showed me, it\u2019s neither. With the exception of those short ribs, which take the time and effort any special-occasion dish deserves, all of the recipes are quick and simple to prepare, full of flavor, and exactly the kind of bone-warming food I want in the last frigid days of winter.It\u2019s taken some time\u2014years, actually\u2014but I\u2019ve finally begun to amass the kind of pantry I think my grandmother would be proud of. There\u2019s a giant bag of gochugaru (Korean chile flakes) in my freezer, as well as giant dehydrated anchovies for making Korean dashi. I can\u2019t rest without knowing I have dried shiitake mushrooms and at least three types of seaweed in my cupboard. I\u2019ve even taken a few stabs at making my own kimchi. There\u2019s still so much I don\u2019t know about this food\u2014I am constantly calling my parents asking them what brand of rice is the best, or what the little cartoon woman on the container of gochujang they buy looks like\u2014but I\u2019m finally ready to take it all in with an open mind, and mouth.Get the recipes:1 / 7ChevronChevronKimchi JjigaeView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titKoreanComfort FoodStewRead MorerecipesThese 7 Recipes Are the Definition of Korean Comfort FoodGallery7 SlidesBy The Bon App\u00e9tit StaffRecipes you want to make.
