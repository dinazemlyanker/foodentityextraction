In this trendy, online cosmic playground, Nicholas has taken astrology in an even new direction, using horoscopes as a call to action for social justice and compassion.\u201cTo me everything, every occupation, every interaction is a call to love, which is justice. Socially, if we aren\u2019t trying to create spaces where love, and therefore justice, can occur we are doing the opposite. And we don\u2019t need anymore hate, intolerance, or injustice here.\u201dChani Nicholas\u2019s horoscopes have celebrated the appointment of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other women in Congress and called on readers to support transgender communities. She also believes in making astrology accessible beyond the internet, providing free or low-cost readings and workshops for people who need support but may not have the means. \u201cArt and care should be part of our everyday lives, accessible, and integrated into all we do,\u201d she says.This belief in uplifting community is a family affair. Her wife, Sonya Passi, runs FreeFrom, which works to make safety affordable for all survivors of domestic violence so that they can build lives free from violence for themselves and their children. Later this year, HarperCollins will publish Nicholas\u2019 book, You Were Born for This: Astrology for Radical Self-Acceptance, on how people can understand their life purpose through an astrological lens. Besides working on the book, Nicholas still posts horoscopes and calls to action daily. Here\u2019s what she does when she gets some much-needed down time.Nicholas' truly balanced skincare routine.\nPhoto by Graham WalzerPillow TalkMy wife and I usually have a long talk before bed. It\u2019s relaxing to sort through the day with each other, making sure that we have some quality time to connect once the business of the day has passed. If something is bothering one of us, we\u2019ll generally stay up until it\u2019s sorted through as much as possible. We also tend to wake up and talk about the dreams that we had the night before if we have time. I feel like sleep and dreaming is such an important place to process the events of our waking lives. We both have a very active dream life and are constantly referring to them as the events of the day unfold.Netflix and PopcornWhen I\u2019ve had a hard day I watch The Great British Baking Show on Netflix until it asks me \u201cAre you still watching?\u201d When my wife leaves for long stretches of time I usually lose my will to eat a grown-up dinner and instead have popcorn with butter and Spike seasoning salt. When she\u2019s gone, I also lose all sense of an appropriate bedtime and end up watching too many Beyonc\u00e9 clips on Instagram.  If I\u2019m really wound-up, I end up making memes, most of which are too bad to see the light of day. My go-to comfort food is whipped cream. If I\u2019m run down and ragged I need fat. Lots of it. I could probably live on English trifle.Hydrate, Hydrate, HydrateMy pre-bedtime skin routine is a must. In my twenties I never paid much attention to what my skin needed but now I feel like a desert monster if I don\u2019t hydrate. I use Coconut and Rose soap to wash my face, Rose Hydrating Mist to hydrate it and Pure Passion to moisturize.  If I\u2019m stressed I\u2019ll put on Keep Calm. All products are handmade, completely natural, and made by entrepreneurs at Gifted by FreeFrom.The colorful bookshelves that line Nicholas' L.A. home.\nPhoto by Graham WalzerThe Reading ListIf I\u2019ve got the head space, I\u2019ll read before bed. Right now I\u2019ve got a bunch of books going. If They Come For Us by Fatima Asghar, Decolonizing Wealth by Edgar Villanueva, Little Fires Everywhere by Celeste Ng, and Bright Lines by Tanwi Nandini Islam.Hypnosis by CricketsI\u2019ve recently started to not eat after 6 or 7 p.m., and I feel like it\u2019s helping me to transition from my day to night routines. There\u2019s less work for my body if I stop eating before I sleep and I\u2019m a big night snacker so it\u2019s been a big change for me. I drink a lot of water after I stop eating and take magnesium and melatonin before bed. I\u2019m super sensitive to sound so we put on \u201cCrickets by the Ocean\u201d by Cricket Sounds on repeat to drown out some of the city noise and generally signal to our bodies that it is time to wind down. It\u2019s kind of like hypnotizing ourselves.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishGoing to Bed withprofileRead MoreLifestyleAmy Quichiz Makes Her Bedroom Into a Dance Floor Before Going to SleepBy Neha KulshRecipes you want to make.
