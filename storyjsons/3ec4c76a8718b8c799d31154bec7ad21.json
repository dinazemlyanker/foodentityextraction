Meet them all here.Trendy interior designers seem to have the same checklist: Mid-century modern furniture? Check. Tropical wallpaper? Check. Rose gold accents everywhere? Check.Not Elise McMahon, the brains behind LikeMindedObjects, a furniture and design studio based in Hudson, New York. She\u2019s got decidedly different priorities A pink-highlighted, hexagon-ish-shaped table that bends the rules of geometry? Check. It anchors Relationships, a breezy cafe in New York City. Hanging fixtures that project kaleidoscopic light from floor to ceiling? Check. You bask in that psychedelic glory at the newly redesigned Lil\u2019 Deb\u2019s Oasis in Hudson, New York, which she just recently finished up. \u201cIt feels more like an installation than a basic eating space,\u201d McMahon explains to me over the phone. \u201cThe chefs were up for a wild design, so of course I love to be as wild as a client will allow.\u201dUntethered creativity has been a constant in McMahon\u2019s life. Growing up in the suburbs of Chicago, she lived in a house filled with hexagonal rooms designed by architect Edward Humrich. Her artist parents worked from home\u2014sculpting, metalworking\u2014so she had a front-row seat for the life ahead of her. \u201cIt was a very experimental household,\u201d McMahon says. \u201cTheir work put the small-business mentality in me, and now I\u2019m following that same lifestyle.\u201dEventually, she went on to study furniture at the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, Rhode Island, where she met Hannah Black, one of the chefs at Lil\u2019 Deb\u2019s Oasis and at that time a painting student. At school, Black threw elaborate, epic dinner parties and commissioned McMahon to set the scene, with floral arrangements, lighting, and furniture.\u201cFood is such a equalizer of enjoyment,\u201d McMahon reminisces. \u201cI love making beautiful, fun furniture because it enhances the experience.\u201dAfter graduating from school\u2014and brief stints teaching furniture classes, carving pumpkins, and designing small-scale farming equipment\u2014she reconnected with Black when she moved to Hudson. Soon they were back to throwing experimental dinner parties\u2014but this time at Lil\u2019 Deb\u2019s Oasis, Black\u2019s kitschy, vibrant restaurant with co-chef Carla Perez-Gallardo. Since opening in 2016, it\u2019s garnered a cult following\u2014not just as a gathering place for Hudson\u2019s queer community or the bright, tropical-y comfort food but for the funky, fun atmosphere McMahon has helped conjure in the space. Now, with the recent renovation of Lil\u2019 Deb\u2019s Oasis, she\u2019s channeled more of an '80s ski lodge for the brand-new upstairs lounge filled with furniture she\u2019s designed as well as local artisans she wants to support.\u201cI know that furniture isn\u2019t exactly solving world issues, but being a small business that can create spaces I support in a social way is a noble pursuit for me,\u201d McMahon says. \u201cBy making these interiors, I feel like I can actually directly affect my community.\u201dWondering what comes after millennial pink? McMahon has a few ideas.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishNew YorkDesignThe Healthyish 22TrendsRead MorerestaurantsThis Restaurant Is Basically an Art Installation with Knockout FoodBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
