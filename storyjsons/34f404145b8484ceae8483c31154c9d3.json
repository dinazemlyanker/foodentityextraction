It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.I had never heard of fatteh hummus until Andy Baraghani put a plate of toasty pita chips topped with yogurt, buttery nuts, and chickpeas in front of me at a recipe tasting about a year ago, but I was immediately obsessed. Obsessed! \u201cIt\u2019s a typical part of a Lebanese breakfast,\u201d he told me and the other tasters while I noisily crunched through layers of crisp pita and cashews, creamy dollops of cool unsweetened yogurt, and garlicky chickpeas.\u201cUsually you would have this with some fresh radishes or cucumbers and olives to the side,\u201d Andy continued.\u201cCool, man, whatever you say,\u201d I replied while using my spoon and a pita chip to compose the perfect bite. I held it up to show everyone how the pita was cradling a swoosh of yogurt, pair of chickpeas, and a brown butter cashew on top. \u201cLook, guys!\u201d No one applauded, so I kept eating.\u201cWhy is this so good,\u201d I muffled through a particularly creamy-crunchy mouthful.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!\u201cIt\u2019s the textures,\u201d said Andy. \u201cI baked torn pita with extra olive oil so they get extra dark, toasty, and crisp. Stale ones would work great.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re thhooo thmart,\u201d I said, still stuffing my face.Photo by Alex Lau\u201cThen there\u2019s the yogurt, which is purposely not Greek, for a change. You want that slightly flowy, drizzle-able texture for getting in and around all the ingredients,\u201d Andy continued.\u201cYeah! I see how that\u2019s doing that,\u201d I said, again deploying my signature pita-as-shovel technique to bulldoze more chickpeas towards my face. \u201cWhat the hell did you do to these chickpeas, you fiend? You made them from scratch, didn\u2019t you. That would be so you.\u201d\u201cYeah, no,\u201d replied Andy. \u201cThey\u2019re canned. I just warmed them up with some garlic and olive oil to make them more savory.\u201d\u201cWell, that worked too!\u201d I yelled. By now, everyone else at the tasting, aware that I would not be sharing, had left the table. \u201cAndy, why does it seem like the nuts are surrounded in a cloak of brown butter?\u201d\u201cBecause the nuts are toasted in a skillet with foaming butter, instead of just roasting them in the oven,\u201d he patiently responded.\u201cYou mean you are telling me that you can saut\u00e9 nuts in butter and the nuts will toast and the butter will brown at the same time?! You\u2019re an ever-loving genius, Baraghani,\u201d I said, without making eye contact with him because I was very busy assembling more bites that combined all the soft and crisp ingredients left in the bowl.\u201cAnd then I added some herbs because that\u2019s my thing: herbs,\u201d I heard Andy say faintly, his voice barely audible from across the kitchen. He too had decided to leave me alone with my first fatteh.\u201cI\u2019m going to make this,\u201d I said to no one. There was just enough yogurt left in the bowl for the last piece of pita. \u201cI am definitely going to make this.\u201dGet the recipe:Spiced Chickpeas with Crispy Pita, Yogurt, and Brown ButterThis version of the Levantine breakfast dish, known as fatteh hummus, is all about the contrast of textures and flavors: crunchy pita chips, creamy chickpeas, and tart yogurt.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterBreakfastRead MorecultureOur March Cookbook Club Pick Is Our Very Own Carla Lalli Music\u2019s Where Cooking BeginsBy Julia KramerRecipes you want to make.
