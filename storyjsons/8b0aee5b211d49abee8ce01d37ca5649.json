I\u2019ve brewed hot toddies, dodged toddlers while skidding off the side of Fort Greene park on a borrowed sled, and become besties with my Dutch oven. But there comes a time\u2014March, to be exact\u2014when my brain gives up on seasonality and starts to fixate on spring. But instead of pining for ramps and rhubarb, I\u2019m pinning my hopes on Current Cassis.The Hudson Valley\u2013made black currant liqueur is a take on cr\u00e8me de cassis, a specialty of Burgundy known for lending deep berry, syrupy sweetness to wine cocktails like a Kir Royale. Current Cassis owner Rachael Petach fell for the spirit while WWOOFing on organic farms in France, and years later, decided to make a new interpretation that goes big on herbaceous, almost savory flavor.Cr\u00e8me de cassis is traditionally made from macerating grain neutral spirits with just sugar and black currants (a.k.a. cassis), but Petach flavors her lightly fermented fruit with wild honey, whole green cardamom, lemon verbena, and citrus rinds. The process happens just a few miles from where the black currants are grown\u2014a feat that would have been illegal (!) for most of the 20th century.While currants are popular across Europe, they have a limited fanbase stateside because the federal government banned currant-growing back in 1911. The fruit was thought to harbor a tree-damaging disease called white pine blister rust. Disease-resistant strains were cultivated over time. The federal government left regulation up to the states in 1966, and in 2003, a Hudson Valley fruit farmer named Greg Quinn pursued New York to lift the ban. His black currants form the base of Current Cassis today.As a die-hard fruit lover who awaits the arrival of winter citrus and summer peaches like a sneaker drop, I love that I\u2019m supporting the resurgence of currants with this drink. But it won a permanent spot on my bar cart for taste and versatility, too. At 16% ABV, it\u2019s perfect for sipping straight over ice or spiking a Tuesday night glass of seltzer. On Valentine\u2019s Day, I poured a splash atop cava for a take on a Kir Royale, and when an unwelcome snow storm hit the following week, I even added some to a mug of hot apple cider. But most nights, I ignore the weather report and mix cassis with seltzer for a simple spritz that feels like spring.Current Cassis$27 at Dandy Wine and SpiritsExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make.
