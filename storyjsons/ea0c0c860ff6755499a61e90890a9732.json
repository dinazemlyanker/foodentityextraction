Add mushrooms, kombu, ginger, garlic, and 8 cups water and bring to a simmer over medium-high. Reduce heat to low and cook 10 minutes. Remove from heat; discard kombu.

Cook tofu, working in batches if needed, until golden brown and crisp around edges, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to paper towels to drain; season with salt.Step 4While tofu is cooking, bring dashi to a boil. Add bok choy and carrots and cook until tender, about 3 minutes.

Dania10/15/2020FISH IT\u00b4S NOT INCLUIDED ON THE INGREDIENTS LIST. HOW MANY ?\ngemaSPAIN8/10/2020I just made this and added a tablespoon of coconut cream to the broth for some extra flavor and a thicker texture, and I threw in some noodles at the end to make it into ramen. My favorite part was the tofu! I think I'll try making it spicy next time. :)AnonymousNew York7/29/2020On the cover of the Feb 18 edition of Bon Appetit is this delectable soup soup. The recipe is easy to follow. I just want to know what  are the round things with a red center. They are definitively not radishes.cascaderoverYakima3/11/2018Made this broth in the middle of a snowstorm to warm up. I added extra ginger and garlic for health benefits-ginger is known to help with inflammation, digestion, cold/flu relief (because its a diaphoretic). Garlic too helps with the cold/flu healing, in addition, to containing strong antioxidants. I also added crushed peanuts and bean sprouts for a little texture. I was so happy with the way the recipe turned out! It was simple, and nourishing.  VirginiaLeeMontreal 1/17/2018Bok choy it\u2019s not included in the ingredient list. How much of it should be used?
