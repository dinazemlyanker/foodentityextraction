Instantly, my screen lit up with a small riot of flame and crab emojis. Once summoned, Lucas Sin, chef of mini fast casual chains Junzi Kitchen and Nice Day Chinese Takeout, fired back a loose formula for ginger-scallion crab stir-fry. Several hours later a photo arrived: A neat pile of crab legs with aromatic butter, fortified with \u201c1 loose packet of grocery store sushi soy sauce.\u201dIf the state of my phone is any indication, the days of social distancing have sparked a group chat renaissance\u2014but this exuberant WhatsApp chat is something entirely new. The \u201ccommunity\u201d is a prototype from DEMI, a pandemic-era startup that cuts out the middleman (in this case, social media) and helps food professionals grow and connect with audiences directly.Founded by Ian Moore, the former chief operations officer of Copenhagen-based distillery Empirical Spirits, the app is part of a larger shift from social media to private online communities like Clubhouse and closed Discord servers. Users pay $10 a month per group chat, and for now it all goes straight to the hosts. The growing roster includes Sin, pastry chef Natasha Pickowicz, Italian food writer Katie Parla, AP\u00c9RITIF author Rebekah Peppler, and Peoples Wine managing partner Daryl Nuhn. \u201cI want to build a sustainable business within food,\u201d says Moore. \u201cWe want to show that chefs deserve to get paid more for their hard work, passion, and knowledge.\u201dLike Substack, Pateron, and other popular hosting platforms for subscription-based content, DEMI plans to start collecting a yet-to-be-determined percentage of profits with the launch of its app in the next two months\u2014if development stays on schedule. It\u2019ll launch with an ambitious roster of a hundred hosts, from Sean Sherman of The Sioux Chef to Diaspora Co founder Sana Javeri Kadri, with updated features like a section to store shared recipes and a pared-down notification system to lighten the barrage of message alerts.For DEMI\u2019s food-world hosts, the group chat is another side hustle in a year of reinventions necessitated by COVID-19\u2019s destructive impact on the restaurant industry. According to the National Restaurant Association, over 100,000 eating and drinking establishments closed in 2020, eliminating almost 2.5 million jobs. In response, hospitality professionals\u2014especially those with followings online\u2014are launching recipe newsletters and pop-ups, searching for new ways to connect with their communities and turn a profit in the process.\u201cLike a lot of restaurant people, I\u2019m cobbling together this freelance life by developing recipes, writing stories, and getting involved with campaigns that fit my perspective,\u201d says Pickowicz, who lost her job as the pastry chef for New York's acclaimed Caf\u00e9 Altro Paradiso and Flora Bar last June. She views DEMI as a way to break free from the \u201chegemony of social media\u201d with a format that requires less bandwidth than setting up a Patreon. \u201cI don't want to be in someone\u2019s in-box,\u201d she says. \u201cI like the conversational aspect of the chat. I\u2019m more interested in knowing who Sarah or Sally are, thinking about the people who read it and what their lives are like.\u201dDEMI\u2019s conversational core provides fertile ground for experimentation. As a reporter I got a free pass for both Pickowicz\u2019s Never Ending Salon and Sin\u2019s Chinese-ish Cooking Club, which immediately felt distinct. Pickowicz conducts weekly recipe exchanges with guest hosts from the wide world of pastry, who often stick around to dispense wisdom. Sin drops niche Youtube links, advice on ordering at Cantonese restaurants, and loose recipes for everything from mapo tofu lasagna to superior broth simmered with chicken bones, pork bones, and jinhua ham. The similarities lie in the collaborative, refreshingly casual chat; a space for everyone to geek out about food without having to worry about likes, perfect lighting, or other measurements of clout.In the era of Substack and OnlyFans, DEMI\u2019s bet\u2014that people will pay for increased access to food-world personalities\u2014is a good one. But for the hosts themselves, the big draw is the like-minded community of industry professionals and enthusiastic home cooks that follow them. Where besides Sin\u2019s Chinese-sh Cooking Club could you find three Ph.D. candidates independently writing a dissertation on ketchup?\u201cMy hope is to cultivate a more democratic, flat, open space to talk about Chinese food because my deeply personal, very biased opinion is that a better understanding of Chinese food will make for a better world,\u201d \u00a0Sin says. \u201cIt felt like an extension of what I was doing in my Instagram DMs, which was conversing with a group of dedicated, interesting people who care about Chinese food.\u201dDespite DEMI\u2019s stance as a social media alternative, the two platforms are interwoven.Moore says the team scouted hosts based on their social presence, prioritizing creative storytelling and community building. There is no prerequisite for the hosts to have a certain size following or promote their chat on Instagram, but high engagement is an advantage: Each host (whose followings currently range from 11K\u2013198K) advertises their community on Instagram, creating a clear pipeline from followers to DEMI members.Sin, who started an Instagram account only last March after the pandemic hit, says that DEMI\u2019s closed, collaborative community takes the pressure off, allowing him to start conversations on topics like healthy eating that he\u2019d never raise on social media. \u201cWhen you post on a one-directional platform, like Instagram, people presume you're an expert in the field,\u201d he says. \u201cHere I can be curious and ask questions.\u201dDEMI has a low-stakes vibe, thanks to the inherently closed nature of subscription-based content. Instagram is free to join and users can follow whomever as long as they have a public profile; DEMI\u2019s hosts are handpicked and each community has an entrance fee. Two of the communities\u2014Peppler\u2019s CLUB AP\u00c9RO and Peoples Wine Social Club\u2014currently offer free membership for BIPOC folks, and Pickowicz and Sin both donate a portion of their monthly proceeds to organizations promoting equity in the food industry.Ultimately, engaging with an intimate online community is a privilege that can only exist because of exclusivity. It\u2019s hard to imagine DEMI\u2019s magic working in a group chat of thousands, and it would be foolish to pretend self-selecting communities are a cure for all of social media\u2019s ailments. But watching creators attempt to game Instagram\u2019s increasingly opaque algorithm to reach their audience doesn\u2019t exactly feel democratic either. To me these chats offer a third space between public and private, a glimpse into lives both very similar and very different from my own.When households across Texas lost power for days (or more) in February, my Brooklyn-heavy Instagram feed brimmed over with mutual aid posts\u2014and then went quiet. But Chinese-ish Cooking Club started trading tips for flushing toilets with pool water, conserving phone batteries, and, yes, cooking amid rolling blackouts and water shutdowns. Photos appeared: golden fried rice gleaned from emptied-out supermarket shelves, curry and roti illuminated only by Barack and Michelle Obama votive candles. It was the kind of food that rarely gets documented on social media. I couldn\u2019t look away.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCooking TipsHealthyishTrendsRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
