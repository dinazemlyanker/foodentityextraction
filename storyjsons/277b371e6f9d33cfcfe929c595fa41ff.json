After reading some previous reviews, I  too made some Adjust.  I added chili powder,  Hungarian paprika, oregano. I sauteed the onion and garlic with the spices,, then added the beef. I topped it with a combo of parsley and cilantro as I had both and I need to use them up. I also squeezed a half a lime as a final touch. I loved the pomegranate.  I had everything on hand as a have e eggplants in my backyard garden and picked a few off the vine. I think the amount of beef stuffing can be enough for 3 or 6 halves. But next time, I'm going to try it with ground lamb!PattyOklahoma 11/21/2021This was very good. I made a few adjustments: some 7 spice mix in addition to the cumin; brushed a little pomegranate molasses over the eggplants after roasting  as I didn\u2019t have fresh; mint instead of parsley; a sprinkling of sumac before serving. Really nice recipe. GailSMassachusetts9/25/2021Loved this dish. The only changes I made were to swap dried cranberries for the pomegranate seeds and add lemon zest to the finished dish. Absolutely delicious and relatively simple meal and clean up. Hilary8/15/2021We make this with shredded firm tofu seasoned with kabseh spice and shallots instead of beef. It works beautifully with the eggplant and pomegranate. We swap out the yogurt for non dairy when e serve it to vegan friends. Love this combo. MichelToronto 3/15/2021We liked this recipe. We paid attention to the comments and embellished, adding Worcestershire sauce and a splash of sherry vinegar to brighten the beef, and adding lemon juice and salt to the yogurt. The yogurt tied it all together and was super delish. We skipped the pomegranate and didn\u2019t sub in anything else sweet. Didn\u2019t miss it. RobinSeattle, WA2/16/2021This is kinda tasteless, I would put pomegranate molasses in the beef just before serving next timeACF11/6/2020I added crumbled feta cheese on top and a bit of mayo to the beef - tasted delicious!!AnonymousLondon8/4/2020This was SO good and filling. I didn't have pomegranate but used pine nuts, and added mint in the yogurt sauce. Next time i'll just cook the onions before the meat, as I thought the method wasnt very practical and the meat got a little overcooked while waiting the onions to fully soften. But the eggplant was so custardy and delicious, it wasn't even an issue. I made it without the yogurt for my bf who doesn't eat dairy and he loved it. I have gestational diabetes and this recipe ticks all the boxes of what I can eat so thank you!!!AnonymousFrance3/10/2020Not for me. Bland, tastless waste of some nice eggplants and ground beef. AnonymousSan Diego8/8/2019Meh.  Eggplant was great but beef dry and flavorless.   Tried to amp up the flavor with extra spices and herbs... but didn't make much difference. There are more flavorful recipes for eggplant and meat.   AnonymousJohannesburg South Africa 4/29/2019Great recipe! I'd increase the time to roast the eggplant, as mine weren't as done as I'd like. Couldn't find pomegranate, so subbed lemon juice sweetened with honey and drizzled over the top. Also took one reader's recommendation and topped with pickled red onions. To make healthier, cut down a bit on the olive oil and used fat free Greek yogurt. A delicious meal!Honolulu4/9/2019The basics of this recipe are excellent. The preparation and cooking of the eggplant resulted in a buttery-sweet smooth eggplant filling with the skin offering a hint of crunch. I completely changed the seasoning of the beef to incorporate Greek flavors to use up what was in my fridge, but I kept the way it was cooked, included the garlic and onion. A great base to play with flavors. I'm going to add this into my rotation but try to use more vegetables diced finely into the beef to lighten it up a little. livseesfoodNorth Carolina3/15/2019This recipe is wonderful: the eggplant is custardy, the ground beef makes the meal hearty, and the lovely garlic yogurt dressing is so much more than the sum of it's parts. Will be making this again and again. AnonymousBrooklyn10/16/2018This was super delicious. I can't eat dairy so I subbed in tahini for the yogurt and it was still amazeballs. AnonymousDenver9/13/2018Literally the most delicious meal I've made/eaten in a while. What a great idea. I've made it twice and use whatever fresh bits and bobs I have in the fridge on that day. The last time I made it, I stirred through finely chopped spring onions just as the mince finished cooking, and topped it with chili flakes and pickled red onion along with the herbs. Superb! Lemon wedges and Lemon zest are also amazing.
