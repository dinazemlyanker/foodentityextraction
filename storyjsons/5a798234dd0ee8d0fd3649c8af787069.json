And while I have no problem confidently coaching you through how to poach an egg or make a soup, I have a secret: I\u2019m terrified of dough. Much like dogs, dough can smell this fear, which is the likely reason why, after countless failed attempts at fluffy breads, flaky pies, and chewy pizzas, I\u2019ve developed an extreme aversion to recipes that ask me to make dough.But a few weeks ago, as I reached into the oven and pulled out the Glazed and Flaky Apple Tart I spent the better part of a day making, I was forever changed. Maple-and-vanilla roasted apples sat atop a puffy, flaky rectangle of Shortcut Puff Pastry that I, YES I, had made. I counted at least 11 distinct, flaky layers in the tart base. \"LOOK AT MY LAYERS!!!\" I would shout to anyone within earshot. The buttery-yet-light, flavorful pastry broke into a thousand little flaky shards with each bite. I was hooked.The flaky blanket on top is all the convincing I need to make more chicken pot pie.\nALEX LAUEver since that day, I\u2019ve been itching to make and freeze another batch or two of Shortcut Puff Pastry so I can practice rolling and folding the butter-studded dough. (The roll-and-fold process is what encases all those pieces of butter between layers of dough\u2014as the water in the butter evaporates in the oven, the dough separates into its many layers.) I\u2019ve also become obsessed with searching this website for all the excuses I can find to use puff pastry: Chicken pot pie. Crispy cheese twists that would go very well with an icy martini. Little hand pies stuffed with spiced lamb and currants, because you can 100 percent use puff pastry anywhere you'd use regular pie crust. This insane carrot tart spread with a thick layer of ricotta. A Butternut Squash Tarte Tatin with a puff pastry base\u2014another Thanksgiving contender.You may be wondering how I, who can\u2019t even tell when I\u2019m working with dead yeast (did you know that yeast expires, because I didn\u2019t), managed such a feat of butter-and-flour architecture. Well, Shortcut Puff Pastry is engineered to be many times easier than traditional puff pastry (which is one of the more time-consuming pastry projects you can commit to), and the difficulty-to-deliciousness ratio makes it entirely worth trying yourself rather than buying frozen puff pastry at the supermarket. All credit for this recipe goes to my guru in life and pastry, Claire Saffitz, who showed me the entire puff pastry process from start to finish.Claire demonstrates how to fold the pastry into thirds, right before rolling it out\u2014again.\nPHOTO BY MICHAEL GRAYDON + NIKOLE HERRIOTT, FOOD STYLING BY REBECCA JURKEVICH, PROP STYLING BY KALEN KAMINSKIWatching Claire make her shortcut dough (which she developed to be much easier and faster than the \u201creal\u201d lamination method that professionals use to make croissants and such), the thing that struck me most was that she knew within seconds of feeling the dough between her fingers whether it was the correct consistency or not. The dough was a bit too crumbly at first, so in went an extra drizzle of water. \u201cThere we go,\u201d she said as the clumps of dough started to come together in fist-sized balls. \u201cThat\u2019s starting to feel familiar.\u201d I watched her use long, confident rolls to coax the lumpy mass into a perfectly smooth rectangle.But here\u2019s the real thing Claire taught me in all this: Being a more confident baker doesn\u2019t always mean being a slave to a recipe. Sometimes, you need to allow yourself to simply trust your instincts. Every time I used to embark on a dough project, I would painstakingly measure out each gram of flour and add exactly the amount of water called for, not a milliliter less or more, because PRECISION. Well, it turns out your dough doesn\u2019t really give a crap about precision. Sometimes it\u2019s just going to want more liquid, or flour. If it looks and feels dry as sand even though you measured your ingredients exactly, go ahead and add more water.And if something goes still awry, the worst that happens is you\u2019re left with a tray of less-than-perfect pastry that was meant to live out its days dipped in a bowl of ranch or smeared with Nutella for a standing-around-the-kitchen snack. And if that\u2019s failure, I can live with it.Get the recipe:Shortcut Puff PastryWhen this buttery, flakey puff pastry comes out of the oven, chances are you'll be shocked to remember you made it yourself.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titDessertPastryThanksgivingPuff Pastry DoughRead Moretest-kitchenThis Glazed and Flaky Apple Tart Will Make You Forget All About PieBy Christina ChaeycookingI Almost Set My Kitchen on Fire Making These Cheese Twists, But I Still Love ThemBy Elaheh NozaricultureOnce You Have This Baking Tool, You'll Never Be Able to Live Without ItBy Claire SaffitzRecipes you want to make.
