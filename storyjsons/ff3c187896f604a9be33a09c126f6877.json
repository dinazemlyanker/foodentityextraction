(Watch the icon Maangchi make it here.) But this is not traditional bibimbap (hence the name): First, it doesn\u2019t include some of the usual players (soybean sprouts, spinach, carrots, all prepped individually). Instead, you'll choose 12 oz. of whatever spring veg you'd like (snow or snap peas, asparagus, frozen peas), so long as they're cut to the same size, and cook them together. Second, it uses leftover rice and a nonstick skillet to produce super crispy grains (in bibimbap, the rice is only crispy when it\u2019s cooked in a stoneware pot called a dolsot).All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

If using snap peas, trim ends, remove fibrous string, then slice into pea-sized pieces or thinly on the bias. Set aside.Step 2If using, thinly slice 2 Persian cucumbers and place in a small bowl. Season with a fat pinch of kosher salt, then massage cucumbers with your hands, gently at first, then more aggressively as you go, just to soften. Pour off any excess liquid, then add a splash of unseasoned rice vinegar. Taste and season with more salt and vinegar if needed. (You can also add a pinch of sugar or a bit of honey to taste.) Set aside.Step 3Trim roots from 4 scallions; discard. Thinly slice scallions crosswise. Set aside a handful of the dark green tops for serving.Photo and Food Styling by Sarah JampelStep 4Now you are ready to crisp the rice. Heat 2 Tbsp. vegetable oil and 2 tsp. toasted sesame oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add remaining scallions and cook, stirring often with a heatproof rubber spatula, until starting to soften, about 3 minutes.Step 5Scrape scallions with oil into a large bowl; reserve skillet. Add 4 cups cooked short-grain white or brown rice, chilled overnight, and 1\u00bd tsp. kosher salt to scallions and mix well with spatula, making sure there are no lumps of rice remaining. (It\u2019s tricky to do this step in the pan without rice flying everywhere!)Step 6Heat 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil in reserved skillet. As soon as oil is hot, add rice mixture and press firmly into an even, compact layer. Cook until deeply browned underneath, 6\u20138 minutes.Photo and Food Styling by Sarah JampelStep 7While the rice mixture is cooking, make the dressing. Whisk together 2 Tbsp. gochujang, 2 Tbp. soy sauce, 2 tsp. honey, remaining 4 tsp. toasted sesame oil, remaining 2 tsp. unseasoned rice vinegar, and 1\u20132 Tbsp. water (if using Sriracha, omit the water) in a small bowl. Taste for heat: You can add more gochujang if it\u2019s not spicy enough or more water if it\u2019s too fiery. Set dressing aside.Step 8When the rice is finished, divide among bowls and set aside (if you\u2019d like, cover them with a kitchen towel to keep warm).Photo and Food Styling by Sarah JampelStep 9Combine 1 cup fresh (or frozen) peas and reserved snow peas in the same skillet (no need to wipe out) and cook over medium-high, stirring, until just starting to sizzle, about 1 minute. Add \u00bc cup water and cook, stirring often, until peas are bright green and crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl and season with salt.Step 10You are almost done! Time to fry the eggs and assemble the bowls. Heat 1\u00bd tsp. vegetable oil in same skillet and heat over medium-high. Crack 2 large eggs into each side of skillet and cook until eggs are setting underneath but whites are still clear, about 1 minute. Sprinkle \u00bc tsp. soy sauce over each egg, then continue to cook, basting whites with oil (tilt the pan so that it pools), until completely set and opaque, about 1 minute more. Transfer eggs to serving bowls and repeat process with remaining 1\u00bd tsp. vegetable oil, 2 large eggs, and \u00bd tsp. soy sauce.Photo and Food Styling by Sarah JampelStep 11Making individual piles, evenly distribute pea mixture, reserved cucumbers, 1 cup pea shoots (tendrils; if using), and some radish and/or carrot pickles (if using) among reserved bowls of rice, arranging on top of rice. Top with reserved sliced scallion tops and drizzle generously with reserved dressing. Serve remaining dressing alongside. Mix together before eating!Photo and Food Styling by Sarah JampelHow would you rate Crispy Rice Bowl With Spring Vegetables?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (13)Back to TopTriangleThis is really really delicious. Insanely so. But I would not describe this as \"easy\". Sort of a lot of steps for a rice bowl. And you are expected to anticipate making it by cooking the rice a day ahead? But it is REALLY good. Also frying the eggs and basting in soy sauce is a huge splattery mess, in a way that I think a recipe should prepare you for. Also the rice took twice as long as specified to get crisp. But with all that said, I would make it again :) EmilySan Francisco CA6/16/2021This is one the best things I have ever made! My family is ranting & raving! Didn't have any rice vinegar & forgot to even add my regular white vinegar as a substitute for the dressing, yet it still turned out amazing. I can't really do nightshades, so instead of cucumbers, I saut\u00e9ed some mushrooms in oil + some of the liquid & seasonings that the carrot pickles came in. I have been wanting to incorporate a wider variety of vegetables into my diet & this was pure perfection & so easy!! Will be in my regular meal rotation, forevaaaa...BezsennyCALIFORNIA3/3/2021Wow, wow, wow. This meal is so delicious. I've made it a handful of times and it never disappoints. JenIndianapolis, IN1/11/2021I never write reviews, but this is so freaking delicious. I make it at least every two weeks. It is also very versatile bc I just use veggies I have on hand. Highly recommend!AnonymousCT8/27/2020This was delicious! Although far from a traditional bibimbap, this (white) twist on the Korean dish was surprisingly yummy. Perfect for a summer lunch. Anonymous8/6/2020AMAZING!!! I added snow peas, green beans, and zucchini... highly recommend!  Eva CuevasConnecticut 7/22/2020My rice didn't turn crispy unfortunately.  Will try again. Good flavours with the soy sauce / egg combo. Greens were perfect.mumslittlehelper6/25/2020This is so very easy and delicious. Definitely going into my easy-delicious dinner category. I always have pickled veggies and they did add a lot to the flavor so try not to skip!Chicago, IL5/29/2020The crispy bits at the bottom of the pan of fried rice are the best, so this dish sounded absolutely divine! So easy to make for a quick meal, and I love that it is versatile. kathyxAuckland, New Zealand 5/29/2020I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t get over the introduction to the dish: Bibimbap is not made with straight gochujang. Your special sauce IS basically bibimbap sauce (gochujang, sugar/honey, soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil and water (to thin it out)...).AnonymousNew york5/27/2020I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t get over the introduction to the dish: Bibimbap is not made with straight gochujang.

I definitely went rogue though. I ended up burning my rice and used plain white rice. I also used half a regular cucumber. But the fried egg and the dressing just made this dish fresh and delicious. AnonymousDavie, Fl5/27/2020I really enjoyed this recipe!! I\u2019ve never made crispy rice but oh my- it\u2019s so good! Perfect to whip together and use up any veggies you have in your fridge. This will be a regular in the weeknight rotation from now on.
