It will also take you under an hour to make!Ingredients4 servings\u00bdcup extra-virgin olive oil8garlic cloves, thinly sliced1lb. ground chicken or turkeyKosher salt\u00bccup dry white wine2Tbsp. tomato paste3pints cherry tomatoes1red chile, such as Holland or Fresno, thinly sliced12oz. bucatini, spaghetti, or rigatoni1Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces2oz. finely grated Parmesan (about 1 cup), plus more for serving2cups basil leaves, torn if largePreparationStep 1Heat oil in a large pot over medium until shimmering.

I am at the point where I have more cherry type tomatoes than I know what to do with.  Every year, I find myself looking for recipes to use up the surplus, and this year I think I've finally found a keeper.  I followed this recipe except I was a few cloves of garlic short, much to my dismay.  Even with this omission, the pasta was delectable.  I used bucatini because I adore it.  And fresh Italian basil from the garden.  I might consider trying this without the ground chicken/turkey.  Don't get me wrong, it's great with the protein, but I think this could hold its own as a veg pasta quite nicely, and I'm always looking for those opportunities.   We served with a green salad and hearty bread. Will definitely make again.jjeichnerRedmond, WA9/11/2021One of the best recipes ever published on this site.  Bravo, Andy! I made this for the first time shortly after the recipe was published and have since made it about twice a month (or more!).  It\u2019s a perennial, enduring favorite and somehow continues to taste delicious despite the dozens of times my partner and I have had it.  I use a little bit less oil (closer to 1/3 cup) and omit mixing in the butter and parm at the end, so my rendition is a little lighter, but otherwise stick to the recipe as written. Always with turkey.  We tried it once with beef early on, but this recipe really needs the lightness of the turkey to sing. AnonymousWilmington, DE9/1/2021It was really good but I don\u2019t see what was so summery about it. It was so hot when I ate this pasta it did feel like summer. ER doctor said this pasta gave me heat stroke but I\u2019m alive thank youSoggy PastaCity of Angels7/17/2021Very simple. Can't mess this up and it was delicious. Anonymous9/15/2020I would recommend this recipe however even when making the entire box of pasta there was way too much sauce. I wondered if the recipe should really call for 1/2 cup olive oil. My ground turkey was floating. The cherry tomatoes I used were from my garden and they were very large which added to the liquid. The overall taste was very good however and I was pleased to use up many of my tomatoes and basil.Tara!7NJ 9/12/2020delicious! Easy enough to be a weeknight dinner staple. Ended up using ground beef, still delicious but next time will definitely be using turkey. AnonymousAustin TX9/2/2020This is a beautiful recipe and a favorite new way to finally make use of our small garden\u2019s fresh tomatoes and basil on warm summer nights. Because this has it\u2019s own clean clear presentation and taste I don\u2019t alter the ingredients. The one exception as someone mentioned might be in the case of the measured amount of olive oil, which I usually just eyeball and use as needed anyway, but if cooking for someone living with necessary \u201cno-any-fat\u201d restrictions due to health reasons, I assume that they already know how to navigate and select from recipe collections. For most of us some amount of olive oil is needed when the meat used is lean chicken or turkey breast. It\u2019s such a fresh recipe making use of only a few spices or herbs allowing the summer-time-only incredible taste of seasonal tomatoes and basil to stand out. Thanks for this one. It\u2019s in our family\u2019s repertoire since before and now during the 2020 pandemic stay at home days and nights. AnonymousChapel Hill, North Carolina, U.S.A.7/30/2020This Summer Bolognese is sooo delicious... I added a little spicy sausage and onion while cooking the meat and it added a little spice that was phenomenal. A great summer pasta that uses fresh ingredients. AnonymousNew Jersey6/10/2020Love this Summer Bolognese recipe! In the process of making it for the second time right now in the past month. \nIt will for sure be made many many more times in the coming extremely hot Sacramento summer months, that also bring amazing fresh tomatoes and fresh basil at the local Farmers markets.\nThank you BA for another fabulous recipe!!!addiec1128Fair Oaks, CA5/27/2020This recipe is so delicious and incredibly easy to follow. Will definitely be making again.AnonymousLos Angeles, CA5/26/2020I didn't have any turkey or chicken in hand, so used some left over steak that i grounded up, made for a nice alternative GeoDude68Melbourne4/4/2020So so delicious. I love this dish and feel like it\u2019ll be in permanent rotation for years! I\u2019ve made several times and it never disappoints. At the moment I\u2019m recommending it to anyone who will listen to me (and then I\u2019ll beg them to share).elspBrisbane, Australia 3/2/2020I love this dish! I make it alternating-ly without the chicken or the Parmesan to make the dish Kosher. It's delicious either wayAnonymousNew York1/14/2020I mainly followed the recipe, but used ground turkey thigh instead of chicken. After cooking everything, I felt it needed a little pop so I ended up adding a bit of balsamic vinegar (maybe 1 tsp). That helped, but needed still more zing...I didn't want more sweetness, so added another 1 tsp of red wine vinegar. That did it! Quite delicious.whitneybouckSan Francisco11/27/2019Fabulous. Truly a 'lighter' version of an old favorite that feels like you're savoring the last of summer. And also very easy to make. Highly recommend!AnonymousChicago, IL9/14/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titPastaItalianEuropeanCherry TomatoTomatoVegetableSpaghettiPasta & NoodlesRigatoniGround TurkeyTurkeyPoultryGround ChickenChickenSummerQuickEasyWeeknight MealsMainNut-FreeHealthyishSimmerLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
