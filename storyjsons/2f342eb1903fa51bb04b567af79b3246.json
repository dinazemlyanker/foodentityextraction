He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.\u201cVelvety.\u201dThat\u2019s the word that my friend Gabe used to describe Andy Baraghani\u2019s Beef and Ginger Stir Fry and, with that, I knew what I was making for dinner Sunday night.Not that I needed Gabe to remind me of the allure of this quick-and-easy dish; I\u2019ve been staring at a photo of it for more than two months now\u2014all glossy and saucy and burnished looking. I mean, come on\u2014how can you not want to make it!The stir fry is inspired by the Filipino dish bistek, a version of which Chris Morocco developed with chef Angela Dimayuga for our December 2017 issue of Bon App\u00e9tit.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Alex LauAndy\u2019s version requires just a handful more ingredients, but most of them are pantry staples: ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, and...butter.It\u2019s that last ingredient that makes the dish \u201csexy,\" according to Andy, or velvety, according to Gabe. I just know that it\u2019s delicious.It couldn\u2019t have been easier to make, and my version looks almost as gorgeous as Marcus Nilsson\u2019s photo, especially with a side of saut\u00e9ed bok choy and jasmine rice. The only thing I\u2019ll change next time (and there will definitely be a next time) is that I\u2019ll stir fry the beef and onions in two batches, so as to not crowd the pan and to let the onions take on more color. Either way though, I\u2019ve officially got a new weeknight dinner in my arsenal.Get the recipe:Beef and Ginger Stir-FryMake this glossy, buttery beef stir fry when you need dinner on the table in less time than it takes to listen to a podcast.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterBeefStir-FryOnionRead MoreShrimp and Basil Stir-FryChicken and Green Bean Stir-FryOne-Skillet Hot Sausage and Cabbage Stir-Fry with ChivesStir-Fried Eggplant with Basil and ChilesRecipes you want to make.
