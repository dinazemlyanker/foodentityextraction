I have made it many times and it is always delicious. To Anonymous in Phoenix:  Half the sauce is set aside for serving and the other half is used to baste the ribs after the initial 2-3 hour cook time. But I'm sure they still came out great !  AnonymousBoston7/24/2019putting together this recipe for this evening's meal. ... The recipe does not indicate what to do with the 1/2 of the sauce that is NOT put aside for serving. Made the assumption that is should be placed on the ribs after seasoning with salt and pepper. Hopefully this is the correct assumption.AnonymousPhoenix7/10/2019THESE ARE SO GOOD. I liberally seasoned before wrapping which I think was helpful. I only did one rack and it was done at 2hr 15m. With no grill, I used my broiler and the foil packets as bowls for the BBQ. Served with mashed potatoes and celery. Fantastic recipe.AnonymousMadison, WI6/25/2019More of a question, when using the adobo are you just going for the sauce or does the 1/4 cup include chilies as well?Anonymous11/25/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titRibsKoreanEast AsianAsianPork RibPorkMeatEasyMainDairy-FreeNut-FreeRoastSuper BowlFourth Of JulyMemorial DayLabor DayDinnerRecipes you want to make.
