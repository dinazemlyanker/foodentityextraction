Here a similar balance between refreshing acidity and meaty richness comes from pickled jalape\u00f1os, fresh herbs, a tangy-creamy buttermilk dressing, and slices of mortadella tucked between the lettuce layers. The result is a wedge salad with flavor and zip all the way to its core. It would also taste (and look) great with torn green olives, toasted pistachios, and/or thinly sliced shallots softened in pickled jalape\u00f1o brine. \u2014Ali SlagleAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.
