Her faithful rendition of khao man gai is comprised of gently poached chicken served with aromatic rice cooked in chicken stock; a garlicky, spicy sauce for dipping; cucumbers; cilantro; and a little bit of chicken broth.

It\u2019s heavenly.THE VIBE IS: leisurely at the brick-and-mortar shops, with lots of counter-top stools by the big windows and small four-top tables, and more lively at the canary yellow food cart, where you\u2019ll still find crowds lining up for khao man gai.PRACTICAL STUFF: Check the website for the opening times and addresses at the three locations (two brick-and-mortar outposts and one food cart).\u2014Elyse InamineWE ALSO LOVEH\u00e0 VL SandwichSoul-warming soups that will brighten the rainiest day Pizza JerkThe man behind Bunk Sandwiches gives PDX a pizzeria like none otherAfuriA Japanese ramen chain we hope conquers AmericaExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
