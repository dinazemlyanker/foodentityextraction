It\u2019s a salad\u2014but on top of a fried chicken cutlet. It\u2019s like spa food. But it\u2019s fried chicken. Remind yourself which part of this dish is boss by using both regular and panko breadcrumbs for extra crunchy crispy goodness, but you can also just double up on one of them.Reprinted from Cravings: Hungry for More.

Press each side into breadcrumbs. Transfer chicken to a plate. Repeat with remaining chicken.Step 5Pour canola oil into a large skillet to a depth of about \u00bd\".
