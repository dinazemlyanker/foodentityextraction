It was nearly 2 p.m., and my buddy Jesse and I had put our names on the list for lunch at Monell\u2019s Dining and Catering in Nashville at least forty minutes before, and judging by the number of larger groups I had spied in the dining room and waiting on the patio for tables, it made no sense that we would have to wait so long for a table for two. To be fair, I was in town on a mission\u2014to check out as many new restaurants as humanly possible in 72 hours and report back\u2014and on day two I was grumpy, over-fed, hungover, and exhausted. But Jesse insisted on southern food at Monell\u2019s. And there we were.Suddenly, the doors opened, and a flood of grinning people spilled out in one continuous, jovial stream, all belly-laughs and back-pats. They all seemed to know each other. Ah! I thought to myself, The restaurant had a buy-out! That\u2019s why we were all waiting for so long. I\u2019m a smart guy who used to work in restaurants; I know what\u2019s going on.Five minutes later, the host began beckoning the waiting throng inside, party by party. When our name was called, we were whisked through a maze of rooms until we were shown to our seats, the two remaining places at a heavy wooden table for 14. I scanned the faces of the strangers surrounding me, all awkward smiles and nervous laughter, trying to figure out if anyone else knew what the hell was going on. And then our server approached the table and began the speech.Okay y\u2019all, here\u2019s how it works. You got cups with ice in front of you, sweet tea in that pitcher, unsweet tea in that one, and lemonade in that one. Food\u2019s gonna come out fast and family style, and y\u2019all are gonna pass to the LEFT. Food gets passed to the LE-EFF-TUH. Don\u2019t be shy\u2014we\u2019ll bring more of whatever you run out of. Y\u2019all are gonna get to know each other!Half the parties\u2014older couples, families\u2014seemed to know what was about to happen; the other half\u2014other tourists, bachelorette parties\u2014seemed as stunned and bemused as I was. And then, all at once, the southern food avalanche engulfed us all.Pulled pork. Cole slaw. Fried chicken. Collard Greens. Meatloaf. All piled high in bulging baskets and massive mismatched bowls. Cornbread. Corn pudding. Biscuits. Sausage gravy. We passed to the left; we could not believe we were still passing to the left. Green beans. Mac and cheese. Banana pudding. More of everything. Seriously: more of everything. The sheer too-muchness of it all had plastered a gigantic, goofy grin on the faces of literally every person around that table, and the volume, once respectful and hushed, had crescendoed to a giddy, sweaty fever pitch.At some point I accidentally made eye contact with a woman sitting across the table from me who, it seemed, was also on her sixth \u201clast bite.\u201d We sighed in unison, let our forks fall to our plates with a satisfied clang, and chuckled like old friends. And that was when it all made sense. There hadn\u2019t been a buy-out before we got there. Those people I had watched walk out of Monell\u2019s like they were about to march in a parade together didn\u2019t know each other from Adam. But they, like us, had all been sat at long tables at the same time. And they, like us, perfect strangers, had broken bread together. Spooned the gooiest mac \u2018n\u2019 cheese onto each other\u2019s plates and shared oh my LORDs and passed to the left the left the LEFT until they couldn\u2019t be anything other than friends. They hadn\u2019t just eaten; they had been fed.And that, dear readers, is the best meal I had in Nashville that weekend by a mile.Go there: Monell\u2019s Dining and CateringExplore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsNashvilleHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make.
