These building blocks of Korean and Italian cuisines aren\u2019t often found on the same plate, but for chef Jennifer Kim, it all makes perfect sense.\u201cThat\u2019s a question I get asked a lot: \u2018Why Italian?\u2019\u201d Kim, a first-gen Korean-American, tells me over the phone. \u201cI\u2019m not randomly taking two things and trying to make it work. It\u2019s something that\u2019s been in the making my whole life.\u201dKim, 35, grew up in the quiet Chicago suburb of Schaumburg in the 1980s, a place and time when international food aisles and Korean restaurants were few and far between. While her parents worked odd jobs late into the night, she\u2019d fix herself dinner at home, heating up spaghetti and meatballs courtesy of Chef Boyardee with a serving of her mom\u2019s makeshift kimchi on the side. \u201cIt\u2019s in no way traditional kimchi, but for us, it was kimchi when there was no kimchi,\u201d she explains.In many ways, her dishes at Passerotto are simply more sophisticated versions of these early mashups: Cavatelli is tossed in nori butter; lamb ragu is served with chewy rice cakes; gochujang and tofu come together with Manila clams, mussels, and head-on shrimp for a clever marriage of soondubu and cacciucco, a Tuscan fish stew.\u201cThere are a million different renditions of cacciucco\u2014every family has their own,\u201d says Kim, who spent time eating her way up and down Italy and in the kitchen at Nico Osteria and other Italian hotspots in Chicago. \u201cThe first one I had was made by my friend\u2019s parents from Liguria. I remember I felt like I had this before: It really reminded me of soondubu.\u201dThis coming of age story translated into food is exactly what makes the buzzy new restaurant, open since May, so radical. In blurring the borders between seemingly far-flung traditions, Kim\u2019s cooking epitomizes how the children of immigrants often eat, blending the cuisine of their heritage with that of their hometown for an entirely new kind of comfort food.\u201cThe whole menu is a progression, showing people what it\u2019s like to be an immigrant and how other cultures play a part,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy does Italian food make me feel the same way [as] when I eat Korean food? What are the bridges between the two cultures?\u201dThese questions have resonated with diners who often bring their own experiences to the table. Recently, a couple told Kim that her popular cacciucco-soondubu hybrid reminded them of their grandmother\u2019s \u00e9touff\u00e9e, a roux-enriched, tomato stew with shellfish and rice from the Creole and Cajun cooking canons. \u201cIt was such an interesting response,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe fact that this dish isn\u2019t just emotional and personal for me but for someone else [too] is so meaningful.\u201dAnd while connecting the threads between the foods of her youth has become her mission at Passerotto, she\u2019s just as determined to show how no cuisine truly stands alone.\u201cWhen I think of Korean food,\u201d she says, \u201cthere are such large Japanese and Chinese influences. What if we never had those influences? How different would Korean food be? When does traditional food start?\u201dShe pauses. \u201cInevitably, food morphs\u2014and it should.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titChicagoRestaurantsKoreanItalianChefsRecipes you want to make.
