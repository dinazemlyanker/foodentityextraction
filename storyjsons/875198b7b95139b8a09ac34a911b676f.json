Whipped Cream\u00a0Coconut does it again.By Sarah JampelDecember 23, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhotograph by Isa Zapata. \u00a0Food Styling by Cyd McDowellFacebookTwitterEmailAs an erstwhile dairy lover who has recently entered the dairy-free world, I can tell you that some dupes are better than others: The \u201csour cream\u201d isn\u2019t fooling anyone, but the shredded \u201cmozzarella\u201d? I would\u2014and do\u2014eat it by the handful.\u00a0And one of the very best dairy imitators of all requires no nuts and no heavy processing: It\u2019s coconut whipped cream, and you can make it with one can and a bit of arm strength. Chill a can of coconut cream (or milk), skim off the creamy white layer, discarding the watery remains, and then whip the fatty part by hand or with a mixer. Add sugar and vanilla if you like, and that\u2019s that.Before you rush to the kitchen to crack open your can of coconut cream, consider these keys to success. Begin by choosing a high-quality coconut product\u2014some will whip up whiter, while others will take on a gray hue. Christian Reynoso, who serves coconut whipped cream with his Tropical Babas, likes Let\u2019s Do Organic; vegan cookbook author Gena Hamshaw usually turns to Native Forest. You can use either coconut milk or coconut cream, but Reynoso and Hamshaw both go with cream\u2014because you\u2019ll be getting rid of all of the watery stuff anyway, cream generates less waste.Whatever you choose, chill it thoroughly to encourage the separation of fat and water and promote easy whipping. Hamshaw recommends chilling the can for two full days, though Reynoso takes a shortcut and sticks the can in the freezer for 30 minutes. Set a timer, though\u2014if you leave it in the freezer too long, it will become too solid to manipulate.Follow all of these guidelines and you\u2019ll get a glossy, voluptuous mass\u2014thicker than real whipped cream and with more body and weight\u2014that holds its shape beautifully and makes a logical accompaniment to pie, ice cream (dairy-free or not), and cake. When I tell you that I enjoyed a hefty dollop of unsweetened coconut whip on a slice of a very rich dairy-free chocolate tart, I am NOT\u2014I repeat NOT\u2014lying.But coconut whipped cream isn\u2019t simply a stand-in for dairy-ful whipped cream\u2014it also has distinct advantages. First, it\u2019s nearly impossible to overwhip\u2014you won\u2019t get to the same weird buttery place you would if you took heavy cream too far. \u201cI\u2019m no coconut cream scientist,\u201d admits Reynoso, \u201cbut it seems like coconut cream can\u2019t be overwhipped. It only whips to soft or medium-soft peaks.\u201dSecond, coconut whipped cream tastes, well, distinctly coconutty. Whereas whipped cream is a bland, milky-rich backdrop, coconut whipped cream is bold, adding an element of flavor that makes plain or simple desserts\u2014like a pile of fresh berries, a slice of unadorned pound cake, or a tender biscuit\u2014feel special and complex.And, finally, coconut whipped cream won\u2019t weep (a.k.a. exude moisture) over time, which means you can store it in the fridge for several days. Re-whisk it before serving to breathe in new life and then use it on more desserts or to make your morning coffee or afternoon snack luxurious. \u201cWhen I have any whipped coconut cream around,\u201d says Reynoso, \u201cI\u2019ll add it to iced or hot coffee. I dip bananas and whatever fruit I have in it too.\u201dIt\u2019s probably not socially acceptable to dip a piece of fruit into whipped cream in the middle of the day. But dip a banana into coconut whipped cream? That\u2019s basically a healthy snack.Get the recipeTropical Babas With Whipped Coconut CreamWe took the classic yeasted French dessert cakes known as babas on a tropical vacation with a boozy pineapple-rum sauce and pillowy whipped coconut cream.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
