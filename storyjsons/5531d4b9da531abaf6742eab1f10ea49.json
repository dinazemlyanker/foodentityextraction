There\u2019s 1880 Union Hotel, where it looks like a bar fight could break out at any moment. There\u2019s the tiny post office straight out of a set designer\u2019s dream. It\u2019s essentially the kind of town where you wouldn\u2019t blink an eye if you saw a tumbleweed roll through the main (and only) street. Which is why I was so surprised to find Bell\u2019s, an extremely charming and ultra delicious French bistro, smack in the middle of it.So, uh, why open a French restaurant on a one-street town in California? Well, for starters, chef and co-owner Daisy Ryan is originally from the Santa Ynez Valley, where Los Alamos is located. She and her husband Greg Ryan (also a co-owner) recently moved back to the area after working together at Per Se to open Bell\u2019s. Plus, thanks to other spots like natural wine bar Bodega and renovated motel Skyview Los Alamos, the area is quickly becoming a vacation spot for chill-seeking Los Angeles folks. And one New Yorker (me!).When I visited Bell\u2019s this past summer, I was blown away by it all (vibes, check; food, check; bathroom, check\u2014really!). Here, in no particular order, are all the reasons I love it:The perfect appetizer DOES exist. And it\u2019s tinned Spanish sardines (from La Br\u00fajula) with homemade saltines sprinkled with chives. *chef\u2019s kiss*There\u2019s a vintage French sardine recipe book by the bathroom. That\u2019s a reason to visit.Okay, wait. Another perfect appetizer exists. We\u2019re talking a sliver of crepe cake layered with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and topped with caviar AND Santa Barbara uni. Decadent.The salads here aren\u2019t afterthoughts. When I was there, the stone fruit salad had scarlet runner beans, aged cheddar, crunchy pistachios, and a tangy whole-grain mustard vinaigrette.Then there\u2019s the moules frites. It\u2019s a humble dish, that even if you\u2019ve had it a thousand times, just tastes so much better at Bell\u2019s. Maybe it\u2019s the fresh Santa Barbara Hope Ranch mussels. Or the perfect garlicky, saffron-y broth. Or maybe it\u2019s the freakin\u2019 cute dish it comes in that says \u201cMoules.\u201d Either way, you\u2019re ordering it.The fries are salty and McDonald\u2019s-esque in the best way.The dense and super buttery g\u00e2teau Breton cake is the only way I\u2019d like to end meals from here on out.And, and, and!Okay, I am pretty sure I\u2019ve exceeded the word count allowed for this column, so here you go: Head to Los Alamos for the saloon vibes, stay for the moules frites (and all the things!) at Bell\u2019s.Go there: Bell\u2019sExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsCaliforniaFrenchRead MorerestaurantsI Will Gladly Take This Glorious Rotisserie Chicken Joint Over Any Hyped L.A.
