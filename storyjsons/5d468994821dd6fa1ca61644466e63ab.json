The second is Indonesian gado-gado, a colorful composed salad with a spicy peanut dressing. The salad, considered a national dish in Indonesia, traditionally includes tempeh, tofu, vegetables, lontong, hard-boiled eggs, and emping or krupuk crackers. These fresh gado-gado rolls are Lee\u2019s homage to both culinary traditions; wrapping the fresh ingredients of Indonesian gado-gado inside Vietnamese rice paper wrappers.To make tight and neat rolls: Soak the rice paper rounds until they\u2019re just flexible and take care not to overfill them.(Watch Vietnamese cookbook author Andrea Nguyen roll them like a pro here!) Perfecting your rolling technique might take some practice, but we\u2019re using that as an excuse to make these again and again.Ingredients4 Servings\u00bccup plus 2 Tbsp. (or more) vegetable oil\u2154cup unsalted dry-roasted peanuts, preferably skin-on2large shallots, thinly sliced6garlic cloves, thinly sliced2Fresno chiles, thinly sliced6Tbsp. kecap manis, dividedKosher salt8oz. firm tofu, sliced \u00bc\" thick128\" rice paper rounds3cups 2\" matchsticks crunchy vegetables (such as carrots, cucumber, and/or bean sprouts)\u00bdhead of romaine lettuce, thinly sliced4hard-boiled eggs, halvedPrawn crackers (for serving)PreparationStep 1Heat \u00bc cup oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Cook peanuts, tossing, until slightly darkened, about 1 minute. Add shallots, garlic, and chiles and cook, stirring occasionally, until shallots and garlic are softened, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer peanut mixture to a blender; wipe out skillet and reserve. Add 5 Tbsp. kecap manis and \u2154 cup water to blender and season with salt. Blend, thinning with more water a tablespoonful at a time if needed, until smooth and a pourable consistency. Transfer sauce to a small bowl.Step 2Pat tofu dry. Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in reserved skillet over medium-high. Working in batches, cook tofu, adding a splash or so more of oil if pan looks dry, until golden brown in spots, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to paper towels; season with salt. Cut into about 2\" long matchsticks.Step 3Working one at a time, dip rice paper rounds into a large shallow bowl filled with hot water and let soak until pliable but not floppy. Transfer to a work surface and arrange 3\u20134 pieces of tofu, \u00bc cup vegetables, and a heaping \u00bc cup lettuce horizontally across center, leaving a 2\" gap on each side (be careful not to overfill). Drizzle \u00bc tsp. kecap manis over. Using moistened fingers, fold sides up and over filling, then fold side nearest to you up and over filling and roll up gently but tightly.Step 4Cut rolls in half on a diagonal. Arrange on plates with eggs and crackers. Serve with peanut sauce alongside for dipping.How would you rate Gado-Gado Summer Rolls?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleThese are incredible! Made exactly as listed except I just bought the \"fried extra firm tofu\" from the store and chopped that / skipped the extra step of cooking a raw block. Worth the trip to get shrimp chips for serving with too. Absolutely delicious and fresh, a great summer meal. The wrapping was a little challenging (mine didn't turn out super cute) but it's doable and delicious either way. Will make again for sure!kmarxmarxchicago, il8/9/2021Great recipe! These summer rolls are so good.  And that gado gado sauce, I could eat it by the spoonful. Super delicious!
