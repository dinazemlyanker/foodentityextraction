It's a go to when asparagus is in season. It's just a great starting point.  I've changed up some of the veggies.  I've subbed stir fry noodles for rice.  It's always a hit.  I love the sauce from scratch.  It lets you adjust for your taste.  AnonymousSuburban MN4/16/2021This is was delicious, everyone loved, and so easy!!  I used only a 3/4 lb piece of steak (trying to reduce our beef) and used snow peas instead of snap peas.  Threw in some mushrooms as well.  Also, after reading other comments, I used 2 tbsps mirin instead of 3 and I thought it still had plenty sweetness.  Will definitely make again!  yhillsoakland, ca3/10/2021So great. So easy. Make sure you get good quality beef. I just bought \u201cstir fry beef\u201d and it was tough. Didn\u2019t have Mirin so added 3tsp. Of sugar to the 3 tablespoons of rice vinegar + the rice vinegar in the recipe sooo...was a little vinegar heavy but seriously STILL delicious. Would def make again!CovidCookingDebNYC 2/18/2021I make a lot of Chinese food and this one just didn\u2019t live up to the mark. It was too vinegar-y and maybe a little to wine-y as well. We didn\u2019t care for it, and wouldn\u2019t make it again. alohalifeSan Diego CA6/5/2020Delicious and easy to make!Anonymous4/21/2020Super tasty! I've been looking for good recipes that can use cheaper cuts of meat, and this one was quick and delicious. I used asparagus, green beans, and mushrooms for the veggies because that's what I had in the fridge, and I suspect this recipe would work well with any veggies that can be quickly saut\u00e9ed. Anonymous5/2/2019Let me start with an emphatic 'YES I will make this again.' I was surprised how sweet it was when I was done, however, so I'll probably reduce the mirin and add a fresno or jalapeno next time. But the sauce it quick to come together, easy to riff by adding other veg, and it was a hit overall. AnonymousSaint Louis, MO2/20/2019Easy to make, fast for me and completely delicious!\njeff_patterson4076Ankeny, IA6/15/2018HOLY SH*T this is the best stir-fry I\u2019ve ever had!
