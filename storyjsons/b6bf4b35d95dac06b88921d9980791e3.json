Chow can be made with just about any fruit, and while you can substitute another pepper for the traditional Scotch bonnet, leaving out the heat isn\u2019t an option. If your mouth isn\u2019t burning, it\u2019s just not chow. \u2014Lesley Enston, recipe developerAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

It was a flavor bomb - delicious. I couldn\u2019t find scotch bonnets or habaneros, so I substituted serrano peppers. They aren\u2019t nearly as hot, but they added a good amount of heat for my taste. The punchy sauce was a perfect complement to the steak. AmandaPhiladelphia, PA9/5/2021The steak was pretty good, although I'd love to try the sauce on something like fish or chicken where it can really  get absorbed during a longer marinating period. The real star here is the chow; we loved that stuff and found it to be awesome when we used the leftovers from this meal to make tacos. NytashaOakland8/31/2021Very easy dish to make, had to use rump as could not get skirt as late shopping. will do againDavidMelbourne Australia8/18/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titSteakBeefMeatPineappleFruitTrinidadianCaribbeanDinnerWeeknightRecipes you want to make.
