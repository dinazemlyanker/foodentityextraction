A dear friend of mine gave it to me as a gift, which to be perfectly honest, I thought was a little curious. Then I started using it. It quickly reached permanent staple status, and I didn\u2019t think I could love it more\u2014that is, until I started sheltering at home.\u00a0I\u2019ve been cooking a lot and doing the dishes nonstop\u2014or at least that\u2019s what it feels like! These pot scrapers make all that cleaning a little easier by removing stubborn bits of cooked-in food without scratching the surface of your pots and pans. Each corner of the scraper is a different shape, so one edge is more like a right angle and another more rounded. That means it can fit into almost any pan curve or tight baking sheet corner, so you never miss a spot.Plus, the scrapers are made of a natural, organic material that seems to last forever: bamboo! It feels nice in my hand and is super sturdy; I\u2019ve been using that same scraper for all this time. The Bambu site has recommendations for how to care for it, but I don\u2019t do any of it and it\u2019s still going strong. It\u2019s the gift that keeps on giving, especially now when I\u2019m cooking and cleaning more than ever. I think I might start sending them to my friends, too.Buy it: Bambu Pot Scrapers, $14 for a set of four on AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
