The brand released its first seven soy- and dairy-free flavors last fall, and, this week, the brand announced that it's doubling its vegan-friendly options. The seven new pints, all of which start with a coconut milk base, include five vegan-ized versions of fan favorite Halo Top flavors\u2014Pancakes & Waffles, Birthday Cake, Candy Bar, Chocolate Almond Crunch, and Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough\u2014plus two brand-new flavors: Toasted Coconut and Vanilla Maple.According to a press release, Toasted Coconut features real flakes of\u2014you guessed it\u2014toasted coconut that \"add a sweet surprise to this creamy coconut pint, serving up tropical vibes,\" while Vanilla Maple is a classic vanilla ice cream with just a \"hint of maple\" added in to kick it up a notch. Each of the seven new flavors clocks in at somewhere between 280 to 360 calories and 16 to 24 grams of sugar per pint. They'll be available in grocery stores nationwide in February, but if you just can't wait (and have $29.42 to spare for shipping costs), the vegan treats, as well as the rest of the Halo Top collection, can be ordered online at Ice Cream Source.Courtesy of Halo TopHalo Top first introduced vegan-friendly options to its line of low-cal desserts in September 2017. Those first seven soy-free, dairy-free options were, like several of the new options, altered versions of existing Halo Top flavors: Peanut Butter Cup, Chocolate, Oatmeal Cookie, Sea Salt Caramel, Caramel Macchiato, Cinnamon Roll, and Chocolate Covered Banana. \"The number one request that we get from our fans is to make a non-dairy and vegan-friendly version of Halo Top. Whether you have to or choose to restrict dairy\u2014or only eat vegan\u2014we always want to make sure we listen to our fans,\" Justin Woolverton, Halo Top's founder and CEO, said in a statement at the time. \"It took a long time to 'get it right,' but we're absolutely thrilled with the outcome and can't wait for our fans to try these flavors.\"If the company's past success is any indication, its newly expanded vegan selection will soon be the belle of the dairy-free ball. Last July, Halo Top became the bestselling pint of ice cream in America, and by September, the company had become the bestselling ice cream brand, regardless of carton size, in the country. On top of that, in December, Time named the brand one of the 25 best inventions of 2017\u2014and you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who disagrees.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIce CreamVeganTrendsRead MoreLifestyleHalo Top Is the Most Popular Ice Cream in America, and We're Not MadBy Molly YoungRecipes you want to make.
