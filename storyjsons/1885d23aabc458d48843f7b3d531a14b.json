It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Creating a \u201cBA\u2019s Best\u201d recipe always incites a lot of soul searching in the test kitchen, and the development that led to our legendary banana bread is a textbook example of the phenomenon.To achieve BA Best status, a recipe needs to be a stellar and stunning version of an iconic dish. This isn\u2019t an opportunity for creative riffs or twists and tweaks; we\u2019re choosing the classics, and the final recipe should stand as a perfect, superhero version to eclipse all other versions in existence when we\u2019re done. Often, the development process starts with asking what attributes define the dish, and once we define each critical element, we drill down even further. When we worked on BA Best Meatloaf, we agonized over the bacon on top. The Classic Caesar elicited crouton madness. It is not uncommon to ponder existential questions such as, \u201cDoes baked ziti have to be made with ziti?\u201dWant this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!When it came to BA\u2019s Best Banana Bread, we agreed on these non-negotiable qualities: It had to be made in a loaf pan. It needed to be moist with bananas. It couldn\u2019t be too sweet to eat for breakfast. The mashed fruit needed to melt into the crumb\u2014no sludgy chunks allowed! Nuts proved divisive, so we made them optional. You should be able to make it with ingredients you already have on hand, because when bananas go from spotted to brown, you want to be poised to swing into action.I ate a lot of banana bread while we were developing this recipe, and I couldn\u2019t help indulging in nostalgia for the one from my youth. I grew up on my mom\u2019s go-to recipe, the Kona Inn Banana Bread from the Fannie Farmer Baking Book. It was delicious when warm, and if it lasted into a second day, it begged to be toasted and served with a swoosh of cream cheese or softened butter.Sadly, when I made the Kona Inn recipe, it never came out the way I remembered it (I\u2019ve now confirmed that my mother has been making incremental, proprietary adjustments to that recipe over the years, thus barring every other person of achieving similar greatness). It meant turning my back on Fannie Farmer, but everything I loved about my childhood banana bread ended up in the BA\u2019s Best version. I\u2019ve made this recipe dozens of times, and it always tastes the way I want. It is light but dense; moist but airy; banana-y but brown-sugary and a little tangy too. We\u2019ve published other banana breads\u2014there\u2019s a chef-y one and a chocolatey one. They\u2019re fine, they\u2019re good, but they\u2019re not The Best.This recipe has become the banana bread that my children will think is what all banana bread should taste like, even when they\u2019re grown-ups trying to figure out what to do with their very own blackened bananas. Well, the joke\u2019s on them because I\u2019ve been making some little adjustments of my own over the years. For one thing, I don\u2019t know why we didn\u2019t put vanilla in our recipe, so I always add a teaspoon to the batter when the eggs go in. My mom cuts half the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour, so I do that, too. And because I like a crunchy topper, I sprinkle an even coating of sugar in the raw over the top of the loaf before baking. This loaf lasts less than 24 hours in our household, so my other trick is to make two at a time\u2014bananas permitting, of course. Is it The Best just the way it\u2019s written? Of course. Do I love it more because I\u2019ve made it my own, little by little over the years? Absolutely. We\u2019re making memories here, people, and those are unique.Get the recipe:BA\u2019s Best Banana BreadDark brown sugar is key and a dollop of mascarpone makes for superior tenderness.
