But you best know the three crucial fish categories.By Emma WartzmanAugust 1, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailThere are a lot of fish in the sea. No, we\u2019re not talking about your dating life. We\u2019re talking about real fish. The kind that swim. The kind you eat.So why is it that most people rely on salmon? No shade to our pink-fleshed friend (we love it here, too), but there are so many other types. For the sake of avoiding weeknight dinner fatigue, it\u2019s time to introduce some variety. The best way to go about doing that is to divide fish into three groups and swap within said groups. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but it includes many of the common types you\u2019re likely to run into, most often cut into those large filets you see at the fish counter.Let\u2019s start with the fattiest, most full-flavored fish. That\u2019s where salmon lives, along with arctic char and trout.Next up are the still oily, though slightly-less-so fish. Here we have bass (either sea bass or black bass), snapper, branzino, sea bream, and dorade.Finally, there\u2019s flaky white fish, the least oily of them all. We\u2019re talking cod, haddock, hake, pollock, and halibut. In this recipe for Family-Style Fish Tacos, we don\u2019t even call for a specific one. The choice is in your highly capable hands.Across the board, as long as you stay within those categories, swapping is not only possible, but encouraged. But you need to make sure you start with quality fish. Buying fish is like buying produce: You want it to look and smell fresh, especially if you\u2019re shopping at a grocery store and not at a local fish market where, well, pretty much everything is fresh. The fish should have a bit of a glisten to it and seem plump and firm. Sad fish that\u2019s past its prime will be somewhat matte and dry, sometimes falling apart a bit at the seams. When in doubt, and we\u2019ve talked about this before, frozen is better than previously frozen and then thawed.You can use any flaky white fish for these slow-roasted fish tacos.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Olivia Mack McCoolBut trust your gut and use your swapping know-how. If the halibut isn\u2019t looking so hot, try hake. If you\u2019re trying not to break the bank, opt for cod. Just make sure that no matter what, you\u2019re following the recipe instructions for the form the fish comes in, be it skin-on or boneless and skinless, one big piece or several smaller cuts.One more important note: When swapping, slightly different cooking times may apply. Don\u2019t let that freak you out, though. Essentially, you\u2019re cooking to indicators instead of an exact minute. (This is honestly the best way to cook in general, regardless of what you\u2019re making.) When it comes to that flaky white fish, it\u2019s ready when the thickest part begins to flake away in big pieces with a small amount of pressure, and has turned from translucent to opaque.See? Not so difficult\u2014and your dinner routine just got a whole lot more interesting. Now dive right in, switch and swap your fish, and change up your tried and true fish recipes.This seems like a good place to start:Family-Style Fish TacosNo grill, no deep-fryer, no problemo.
