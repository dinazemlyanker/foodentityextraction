What do I spy among the usual assortment of grain bowls, dairy-free smoothies, and immunity-boosting tonics? Cocktails.Wherever I look, from my Instagram account to my inbox\u2014which is full of eager pitches for things like botanically driven boozy teas and low-calorie alcoholic shrubs\u2014it\u2019s clear that the wellness monster is coming for cocktails.This needs to stop.The wellness industry, which includes everything from global-festival juggernaut Wanderlust to 2,245-dollar Peloton bikes to health-focused lifestyle stores pedaling small-batch kombucha next to healing crystals, is, by its own account, a $4.2 trillion dollar business. It\u2019s no surprise that the wine, beer, and spirits industry is trying to get in on the action by attempting to redefine alcohol as healthy. Even as some millennials are becoming more mindful of their drinking habits, every fun run ends with a pint of beer (or three), and yoga studios are hosting \u201cNamaste Ros\u00e9\u201d events. So-called wellness cocktails might seem like just another gimmick, but it's just plain irresponsible to brand drinking as \"healthy.\"This muddy marketing means that wellness, which Merriam-Webster defines as \u201cthe quality or state of being in good health\u201d has become a nebulous concept. But health isn\u2019t. The WHO defines health as \u201ca state of complete physical, mental and social well-being.\u201d Much like fat-free cookies, veggie chips, and gluten-free snacks, this wave of so-called wellness cocktails feels like yet another attempt to peddle faux health foods to the masses. But no matter how you spin it, alcohol isn\u2019t healthy. Sure, you can infuse vodka or tequila with CBD, apple cider vinegar, ginger, or any adaptogen on the menu at your corner juice shop, but the base product remains the same: a potentially dangerous mood and mind-altering drug.This isn't the first time that alcohol has been associated with medicine and nutrition. Ancient Egyptians used bitters to treat common maladies, Medieval monks prescribed beer to prevent the plague, and our own grandparents swore a shot of whiskey flushed out fevers. But contemporary research proves that (too much) alcohol isn't good for the human body. So when brands and restaurants boast about the supposed health benefits of celery juice cocktails and boozy turmeric tonics, they're actually spreading false information.Am I interested in cocktails that have less sugar and fewer artificial flavors than a 700-calorie, pre-batched jumbo margarita? Absolutely. But I'm under no illusion that these alternatives will be good for me, nor do I want them to be. I\u2019ve spent more than half my life counting calories (or fat or carbs or whatever food group has been deemed \u201cbad\u201d by the wellness machine in any particular year). I\u2019ve been paralyzed by fear of making the \u201cwrong\u201d choice every single time I sit down for a meal, and sometimes I still feel culturally programmed to order the chopped salad (with dressing on the side, of course) when all I really want is a bacon double cheeseburger. I don\u2019t need another one of my vices\u2014sipping an ice-cold cocktail with my dinner or on my rooftop deck at the end of a long day\u2014co-opted by toxic diet culture driven by pseudo-science and Instagram influencers. Marrying booze, an ingredient that is not healthy by any scientific definition, with ostensibly healthful ingredients, doesn't negate alcohol's harmful effects; it simply adds baggage to what should be a purely hedonistic pursuit.Just as I\u2019ve come to terms with the fact that eating a few slices of deep-dish pepperoni pizza (not that cauliflower bullshit) now and then doesn\u2019t make me an unhealthy person, I\u2019ve come to understand that alcohol is an indulgence in my otherwise well-balanced diet. It's not a plate of fruit and vegetables, and that's the point.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishAlcohol & Other DrinksessayRead MoreLifestyleMy Intrepid Quest for a Non-Alcoholic Cocktail I Actually Want to DrinkBy Rachel Sugar Recipes you want to make.
