I stick with the handful of wine regions I typically vibe with\u2014lightly chilled Beaujolais from Morgon, minerally whites from the Loire Valley\u2014and tend to stay away from \u201chouse cocktails\u201d in favor of tried and true classics.But this was different. Just as I was settling in for dinner at K\u0101wi, the latest New York City restaurant from Momofuku kingpin David Chang, what looked like a squat oak wine barrel sliced in half hit the table. It was brimming with crushed ice pellets and a dozen canned boozy beverages of every stripe\u2014beer, wine, cider, and two (!) varieties of sake.I was paralyzed in the best way possible. Where do I even start?! This is the work of Isabella Fitzgerald, the beverage director at K\u0101wi. While the food from chef Eunjo Park is elegant\u2014the kimbap features Hudson Valley foie gras, for starters\u2014this brought to mind something you might see perched on a table in a backyard somewhere in South Korea on a sweltering summer day. Which is what Fitzgerald was going for. She was inspired by the buckets of beer on offer at karaoke rooms across the globe\u2014K\u0101wi\u2019s private dining room doubles as a karaoke room, you see\u2014and wondered what would happen if you replace the usual crappy light beer (sorry, Adam) with beverages someone might actually want to drink.The result is what Fitzgerald and the team affectionately call the K\u0101wi Can Jam. The rotation of drinks changes pretty often\u2014the night I was there, the Can Jam featured Ramona\u2019s refreshing grapefruit wine cooler, crispy sparkling white wine made by VINNY, and a half-dozen heavily chilled sake and craft beers. It\u2019s not technically on the menu, though the team is considering adding it, but for now I\u2019m letting you in on the secret. So, book a karaoke party and be prepared for the delightful  indecision that the Can Jam can cause.Go there: K\u0101wiExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsNew York CityRecipes you want to make.
