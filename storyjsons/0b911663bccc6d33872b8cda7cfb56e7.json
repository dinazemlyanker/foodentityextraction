Gumbo is a deeply personal dish and there are as many versions of it as there are cooks in Louisiana, perhaps even more. There are Cajun gumbos, Creole gumbos, and numerous variations, like the one served at New Orleans restaurant Turkey and the Wolf with tamarind paste and potato chipsThis rendition keeps things fairly classic with the \u201choly trinity\u201d of onions, celery, and green peppers, a roux, and chicken stock. Andouille sausage adds smokiness that\u2019s balanced by the chicken, and okra helps thicken the stew. Some argue that there\u2019s no gumbo without fil\u00e9 powder, so we\u2019ve made it optional. Made from sassafras leaves that are dried and ground, it further thickens the dish. It\u2019s crucial that it\u2019s added at the end of the cooking, just before serving, and never allowed to boil, which makes it bitter.If you prefer gumbo with tomatoes\u2014a nod to Creole tradition\u2014give this one a try, and if you\u2019re not a fan of okra, this rendition is made without. No matter the recipe, rice is a good accompaniment.Editor\u2019s note: This recipe was originally published in our January 2012 issue.Ingredients8 to 10 Servings1tablespoon kosher salt plus more1teaspoon freshly ground black pepper1teaspoon paprika1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper3pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs1/2 cup (or more) vegetable oil1pound andouille or other spicy smoked sausage, cut into 1/2' rounds1cup all-purpose flour2medium onions, finely chopped4scallions, thinly sliced (white and pale parts separated from dark)2celery stalks, finely chopped2green bell peppers, finely chopped2tablespoons chopped garlic8cups low-salt chicken broth2bay leaves1teaspoon chopped fresh thyme2cups 1/2\u201d-thick slices fresh (or frozen, thawed) okra, divided11/2 teaspoons Worchestershire sauce1teaspoon hot sauce (preferably Crystal)1teaspoon fil\u00e9 powder plus more (optional)Steamed RicePreparationStep 1Combine 1 Tbsp. salt and next 3 ingredients in a small bowl; sprinkle all over chicken.

Don\u2019t make this if you are hungry, whip up a jambalaya in a tenth of the time. That being said, this is a truly delicious and indulgent dinner. You don\u2019t even have to use fancy ingredients, the depth of flavour is remarkable. nicoloisonSeattle, WA5/31/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titStewSoups and StewsCajun & CreoleAmericanSausageMeatChickenPoultryChicken ThighMainNut-FreeSimmerDinnerRecipes you want to make.
