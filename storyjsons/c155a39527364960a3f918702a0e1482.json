Well, as any self-respecting red sauce menu will tell you, the answer is\u2026a lot.By Amiel StanekApril 16, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Christina HolmesFacebookTwitterEmailWelcome to Red Sauce America, our coast-to-coast celebration of old-school Italian-American restaurants.The chicken cutlet is the stem cell of the red sauce kitchen: The stuff of life itself, a base protein that can, depending on how you cook it and sauce it, morph into a seemingly boundless array of codified, canonical Italian-American dishes. Marsala. Milanese. Francese. But what does it all mean? What distinguishes chicken Parmigiana from piccata? With the help of the fine folks at Detroit\u2019s iconic Amore da Roma, we break it down.Photo by Christina HolmesMilaneseThe ur-cutlet, simplicity at its finest: a crisp slab of breaded and pan-fried chicken breast, no sauce in sight, maybe a wedge of lemon or tuft of dressed arugula riding sidesaddle. (For your own good, don\u2019t call it schnitzel.)Photo by Christina HolmesParmigianaMilanese\u2014but make it fashion. Crunchy cutlets gilded with a thin layer of marinara and a flurry of grated Parmesan (and, in the case of most Italian-American joints, a heavy sprinkle of mozzarella), then broiled to bubbly perfection. It doesn\u2019t get much more iconic than this, folks.Photo by Christina HolmesPiccataLess crunchy, more saucy. No breadcrumbs this time: slices of chicken get dredged in seasoned flour, saut\u00e9ed in butter, and smothered in an addictively tangy butter-lemon-caper pan sauce. (Find our recipe for it here.)Photo by Christina HolmesFranceseAlso known as \u201cChicken French,\u201d this sauce is similar to piccata (sans capers), but is distinct for its decidedly un-crisp texture\u2014he cutlets are dipped in wet batter rather that dredged in bread crumbs, resulting in an eggy, almost puffy exterior. (The resulting soggy deliciousness is exactly the reason why chef Tyler Kord is wholly obsessed with it.)Photo by Christina HolmesMarsalaLightly floured, saut\u00e9ed, and served in a rich, silky pan sauce composed of butter, onions, caramelized mushrooms, and plenty of marsala, the sherry-esque fortified wine from coastal Sicily.Photo by Christina HolmesSaltimboccaThe name literally translates to \u201cjumps in the mouth\u201d\u2026for whatever reason. Cutlets are pounded out, then layered with sage leaves and prosciutto slices and (sometimes, but not always) rolled into tidy little packages before being dredged in flour and saut\u00e9ed. (Here\u2019s a recipe we love from the team behind Cervo\u2019s and Hart\u2019s.)Amiel Stanek is the editor of Basically.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCutletRestaurantsItalian AmericanRed SauceRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
