Trust us, we've tried. Going low-waste means saying goodbye to countless tools in our kitchen arsenal, from zip-top plastic bags and paper towels to yogurt containers and clamshell produce containers. (Cherry tomatoes, we just can't quit you.) Luckily, these stores are dedicated to easing the transition.The Take-out OptionGreenToGo, Durham, NCThat mountain of are-these-actually-recyclable take-out containers cluttering your cabinets? Not an issue with GreenToGo, which partner with Durham restaurants like BA fave Rose's Noodles, Dumplings & Sweets.  For a fee, you can use its app to order from participating restaurants, then get carryout or delivery in one of the program\u2019s reusable boxes. When you\u2019re done, return the box to a drop-off point and GreenToGo will clean it to health department standards and get it back in circulation.The Coffee ShopThe Tare Shop, Halifax, Nova ScotiaA zero-waste grocery store attached to a zero-waste coffee shop, the Tare Shop offers goods like bulk tamari, olive oil, and sprouts sans packaging.

Produce, grains, and spices from local farmers\u2019 markets and bulk stores come packed in mason jars and cotton bags, delivered to your door in reusable totes. At your next delivery, the Wally Shop collects that packaging, clean its, and reuses it\u2014 leaving your pantry stocked and your garbage empty.The BarHenley, Nashville, TNAt the Henley, ditching plastic is a creative opportunity. Reusable straws, for example, are not so much an obligation as an expression of taste: aromatic cocktails get bamboo straws, to enhance the experience, while classics \u2014 your G&Ts, your mint juleps \u2014 come with metal straws, all the better for stirring. As for the drinks themselves? Instead of buying pre-packaged ingredients for the cocktail program, the team makes their own \u2014 using leftover fruits and vegetables from the restaurant to make syrups, vinegars, and oils.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.The Home Goods StorePublic Goods and Services, SeattleThis is where you go to get reusable cotton bags for storing vegetables, stainless- steel tiffin containers, beeswax wrap, and refillable cleaning supplies like laundry detergent (you\u2019ve got to wash those bags somehow).Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishShoppingTrendsRecipes you want to make.
