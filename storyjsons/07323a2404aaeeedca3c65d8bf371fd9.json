Since 1909, Dewar\u2019s Candy Shop in Bakersfield, California, has made its chews fresh every single day. Before the candy is put into the taffy stretcher, a large dollop of marshmallow is whipped\u2014by hand!\u2014into the base. The result is a taffy that is totally delicious without being too sweet, and perfectly chewy without being too sticky.And unlike a saltwater taffy that relies on fake-tasting commercial flavoring and artificial color, Dewar\u2019s uses essential oils for a more intense, undiluted flavor. And for nut-filled taffies, the shop wraps the candy around the filling, from the original crunchy housemade peanut butter to the very 2019 almond butter taffies.My go-to flavor is peppermint, which is striped with that same marshmallow base and red taffy infused with pure peppermint oil. They taste like the gooey center of a peppermint patty with some serious candy cane vibes. As a kid, I would keep a small collection of these taffy chews in my pockets and try to ration them until the next family gathering. But now that I live across the country, I just order a box to be delivered whenever I need a fix. Which is a lot more often than once a year.Buy it: Dewar\u2019s Taffy Chews, $18 for a 1-pound box at Dewar\u2019sAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
