With the shake of a bottle, I can bless just about any pile of meat and vegetables with layers of complex salty-sweet umami flavor. What would Phat Sii Krong Neua or this Chicken and Corn Stir-Fry be without a dollop of the good stuff? And just THINKING about going back to spaghetti (yes, spaghetti!) sans oyster sauce gets me all grumpy face emoji.Yet, what is this magical brown sauce? Is it actually made of, well, oysters? And how can one start deploying it at home?For starters, oyster sauce is believed to have been invented totally by accident. In 1888 Chinese food stall operator Lee Kum Sheung left a pot of oyster soup on to simmer for so long that it cooked down into a thick brown paste. Sheung took a cheeky taste, not wanting to waste a full pot of food, and realized his caramelized concoction was rich, super savory, and perfectly delicious. So he called it \u201coyster sauce\u201d and started serving it to his customers as a seasoning before going on to package and sell it under the now-iconic Lee Kum Kee Asian sauce empire.PHOTO BY JULIAN COUSINSLee Kum Kee Premium Oyster Sauce$6 at Weee!$17 at AmazonGood news: These days, oyster sauce is everywhere. So grab a bottle, kiss it on the cap, and use it to make any dish a better version of itself. Go wild! Experiment! Like the sauce itself, all the best things happen when you\u2019re least expecting them.Is the grocery store stuff made of oysters too?This is one of those increasingly rare instances where a food product is, drumroll, as advertised. Even 133 years after Sheung\u2019s discovery, Lee Kum Kee (as well as Kikkoman) is still making their sauces with something called \u201coyster extractives\u201d (derived from oysters, water, and salt), along with sugar, salt, corn starch, flour, coloring, and my favorite ingredient, monosodium glutamate (MSG)\u2014which is the same seasoning that makes Cool Ranch Doritos so difficult to stop eating. Also known as oyster-flavored sauce, be sure to check the label before you buy\u2014the ones worth their brine will contain extracts made from real shellfish.Along with a jolt of flavor, oyster sauce adds a dark caramel color to any dish, which, according to assistant food editor Jessie YuChen, is referred to as \u201cthe sauce color\u201d in Mandarin. It\u2019s a shade you\u2019ll notice in many Chinese dishes like stir-fried broccoli, Cantonese beef chow fun, and lo mein. Whether the color is coming from soy, oyster, or another brown sauce like hoisin, it\u2019s a sure sign a dish is going to be tasty. The equation is simple, according to YuChen: \u201cBrown = sauce = flavor.\u201dWhat does oyster sauce taste like?Unlike fish sauce, which is decidedly fishy, lick a dollop of oyster sauce off your finger and you won\u2019t think, \u201cWow, oysters!\u201d But it is \u201cabsolutely loaded with flavor,\u201d according to test kitchen director Chris Morocco. It\u2019s sweet. And salty. But the flavors run deeper than that. The sweetness isn\u2019t one-noted or cloying; it\u2019s dark and developed, like caramel. The saltiness is less like table salt and more like ocean water (\u201cin a good way,\u201d says YuChen). And, sort of like anchovies, all that oyster flavor lends tons of umami and rich savoriness to the sauce. \u201cIt\u2019s like four sauces in one,\u201d says senior food editor Christina Chaey.Oyster sauce undoubtedly packs a punch, but to Morocco, it\u2019s a perfectly balanced one that hits each note evenly. \u201cIt confers tons of flavor [to sauces, stir-fries, and dressings], without overwhelming the other ingredients,\u201d he says.How do you cook with oyster sauce?A versatile condiment for Asian cooking and beyond, oyster sauce can happily stand alone or blend into the crowd. However you use it, a little goes a long way. \u201cI simply finish off quickly cooked meat and/or veg with a plop of oyster sauce and call it a day,\u201d says Chaey. But it\u2019s also pretty much guaranteed to be delicious whisked into a marinade for steak or any meat; drizzled on steamed greens; spooned into meaty braises or soups; or added to your dumpling fillings and stir-fries.More of a recipe kinda guy?

Across the board our food editors prefer Lee Kum Kee\u2019s Premium Oyster Sauce for that OG savory flavor. It\u2019s \u201cthe security blanket of my condiment cabinet,\u201d says Chaey. (According to the Lee Kum Kee website, if you want a milder flavor, try their Panda Brand Oyster Sauce.) YuChen also recommends Kikkoman\u2019s Oyster Flavored Sauce, or Wan Ja Shan\u2019s vegetarian mushroom-based riff for the shellfish-averse.Lee Kum Kee Panda Brand Oyster Sauce$4 at Weee!$12 $9 at AmazonKikkoman Oyster Flavored Sauce$11 at AmazonWan Ja Shan Vegetarian Mushroom Oyster Sauce$19 at Amazon (Pack of 2)What can be used instead of oyster sauce?While there really is nothing quite like oyster sauce out there, if your local supermarket is fresh out of the good stuff and you\u2019re in a bind, choose your own adventure:Sub in the vegan \u201cbrown sauce\u201d in this Bok Choy With Brown Sauce and Crispy Garlic recipe by Fat Choy chef and owner Justin Lee.Opt for the Indonesian sweet soy sauce Kecap Manis, which has the same starchy-thick texture and a similarly sweet-salty flavor, just without the shellfish-y notes.Use a dark (aged) soy sauce, or something like Healthy Boy Brand Mushroom Soy Sauce, which has similar transformative power\u2014albeit a different flavor.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIngredientsOyster SauceShoppingRecipes you want to make.
