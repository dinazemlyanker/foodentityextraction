Catch the trailer for our new show, Food People, launching next week.\u00a0By The Bon App\u00e9tit StaffAugust 19, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailHere at Bon App\u00e9tit we've never really warmed to the word foodie. It's always just felt a little, I don't know, cheugy? We're more than just foodies, dammit! We're food people.\u00a0When we decided to launch a new podcast, we knew we wanted to have the whole staff involved as contributors, as well as friends beyond the brand who care about food as much as we do. And when we thought about how to sum up the spirit of the show, no other name felt as right as this one.\u00a0So welcome to Food People, a show from Bon App\u00e9tit made by, for, and about people who love food. Each week BA\u2019s editorial director, Amanda Shapiro, will ask a serious or not-so-serious food question: What\u2019s the best way to grill chicken? Can meal prep be less terrible? Are air fryers worth the hype? In search of answers or at least a spirited debate, she\u2019ll bring in staffers, chefs, writers, and experts from across the culinary universe. Editor in chief Dawn Davis will step in regularly to interview a guest who inspires her in the kitchen. There will be strong opinions, tons of recipe inspiration, and probably more food puns than we'd like to admit.Give a listen to the trailer below and make sure to subscribe to get the first episode next week; episodes will be every Thursday after that.
