The still hot-off-the-grates spuds get tossed in dressing that\u2019s equal parts spicy, sweet, herbaceous, and nothing sort of addictive. If you don\u2019t have access to a grill, fear not\u2014simply char the potatoes and onions in a cast-iron grill pan.Ingredients4 servings2lb. baby Yukon Gold potatoes\u00bdcup kosher salt, plus more\u2154cup unseasoned rice vinegar3Tbsp. fish sauce1Tbsp. honey\u00bccup plus 3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling2red Fresno chiles, thinly sliced1large red onion3garlic cloves2cups basil leaves2Tbsp. toasted sesame seedsPreparationStep 1Cover potatoes with 3 qt. water in a large saucepan.

I used medium sized redskins, and they worked.  I accidentally added the garlic, and all veggies to dressing, before grilling, and it was good, but too salty.  My fault.  So still 5 stars.  I cannot wait to try this as written, as it all worked, and the potatoes were crispy and the whole dish presented beautifully!!  Other reviewers state that the dressing makes too much.  True.  But it can always be used on grilled chicken thighs the next day!!  KristiColumbus, Ohio7/7/2021This is soooo good. Might want to add the onions a little later to the grill or make sure they're on top in the first minutes, because they char way faster than the potatoes. Dressing is A LOT, and it is very much on the sour side of things, maybe a liiiitle too much, but that could also be my because of the brand of vinegar I used.  CarlyAmsterdam1/14/2021Any thoughts on making this ahead of time to bring to a party and serving at room temp a couple hours later? Wondering how the texture would be. Has anyone tried it?Anonymous9/4/2020I made this exactly as written and it was truly perfect. One of the best potato salads I\u2019ve ever had and it will definitely be in my regular rotation!! AnonymousPortland, Oregon4/17/2020This made way too much dressing for the potatoes, but just added about 1/2 of it and it was delicious. Used a cast iron to \u201cgrill\u201d it on the stove top and get those nice chars. Fav potato dish I\u2019ve made so far AnonymousSan Francisco 4/3/2020I just made this for Labor Day weekend with a guest for dinner. I had to make a few changes--don't own a grill, so I roasted the potatoes and onion in a 400 degree oven for about a half hour, turning them over once. I also had to use what I had in the house, so used a couple of mini sweet peppers for color and a Thai chili for heat. Both changes worked, and the dish was a hit. Would definitely make it again.j_ellisChicago, IL9/2/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladPotato SaladPotatoVegetableFresno ChileChileBasilHerbs & SpicesYukon Gold PotatoSummerEasyWeeknight MealsSideDairy-FreeGluten-FreeGrillingFourth Of JulyMemorial DayLabor DayLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
