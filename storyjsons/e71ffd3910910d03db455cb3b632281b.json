This version has all the familiar aromatics and flavors baked right into cornbread batter, resulting in a crunchy, craggly, super-savory side dish.Ingredients8 servings\u00bccup (or more) extra-virgin olive oil12oz. mixed mushrooms (such a maitake, shiitake, and/or oyster), torn into 1\"\u20132\" pieces2medium red onions, sliced into 1\" wedges4garlic cloves, thinly sliced2Tbsp. finely chopped rosemary, sage, and/or thyme1Tbsp. honey1bunch of Tuscan kale (about 6 oz.), center ribs and stems removed, leaves torn2tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more2cups yellow cornmeal (not polenta)1tsp. baking soda1large egg, lightly beaten2cups low-fat buttermilk\u00bdcup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted, plus 1 Tbsp. for greasingPreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 450\u00b0. Heat oil in a large ovenproof skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high. Add mushrooms and cook, undisturbed, until golden brown and crisp underneath, 3\u20135 minutes. Toss and continue to cook, tossing occasionally, until mushrooms are deeply browned all over, 4\u20136 minutes longer. Transfer to a medium bowl, leaving any leftover oil in skillet.Step 2Return skillet to medium-high heat. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally and adding 1\u20132 Tbsp. oil if pan looks dry, until lightly charred all over and softened, 8\u201310 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring often, until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in herbs and drizzle honey over, then add kale and cook, stirring occasionally, until kale has wilted and is tender, 6\u20138 minutes.Step 3Return mushrooms to skillet, season with salt, and toss to combine. Transfer mushroom mixture back to medium bowl. Wipe out skillet and place in oven to preheat.Step 4Combine cornmeal, baking soda, and 2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton salt in a large bowl. Whisk egg, buttermilk, and \u00bd cup melted butter in another medium bowl. Add egg mixture to dry ingredients and stir to combine. Fold in three-quarters of mushroom mixture.Step 5Carefully remove preheated skillet from oven and pour in remaining 1 Tbsp. butter, swirling skillet to distribute. Scrape batter into skillet. Top with remaining one-quarter of mushroom mixture. Bake stuffing until golden brown, 25\u201330 minutes. Serve in skillet or break into craggy pieces and transfer to a platter.How would you rate One-Skillet Mushroom Cornbread Stuffing?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (16)Back to TopTriangleI prepared the mushroom-kale-onion mixture the day before and refrigerated it overnight for baking the next day. That worked well. I found that although the edges and bottom were quite crispy, the middle was still too moist looking. So, I stirred it up a bit, breaking into chunks and put the skillet back in the oven for another 5 minutes to dry out. That worked well too. Good flavor and good to add the kale to a stuffing. It looked nicer than stuffing usually does on the plate and probably more nutritious too.  The big problem is that it has to be baked at 450 degrees, for 30 minutes and I only have one oven. So I pulled the chicken out and let it sit and then carved it while waiting for the stuffing. I really need two ovens at this time of year!Marcotte ArtistLewiston NY11/24/2021Does anyone think this could be made ahead through step 4, and then baked just before serving?Sarah in Carroll GardensBrooklyn11/22/2020I was thinking of this as a vegetarian supper dish. As is, tasty for a cornbread-heavy \u201cdressing,\u201d but I would make it again with only half the cornbread (using a whole egg), to get a more veg-heavy result. (Or use double the vegetables, of course!). I used a 12\u201d All-clad stainless skillet (the kind they call a frying pan, but which I call a saut\u00e9 pan)\u2014with half the cornbread, it would likely end up crisper, I think. \n\nI think I\u2019d toss in a bunch of saut\u00e9ed, diced celery and carrot next time, too. This is a recipe/idea that can accommodate  a lot of variations!Maria JMinneapolis11/22/2020Can I substitute the buttermilk with a more #healthyish ingredient? :)\n\nMeta-lactose intolerance galCleveland11/14/2020I haven't tried this.  Due to the pandemic I'm planning Thanksgiving for 2 people.  Instead of a turkey, my plan is to spatchcock a chicken.  I'm wondering if it would work to make the stuffing and then place the chicken on it and roast them together to really get that chicken fat dripping into the stuffing deliciousness.  Any opinions?AnonymousPhiladelphia10/21/2020This was so good! I used about 3/4 coarse cornmeal and 1/4 regular since that's what I had on hand. For the herbs I used a combo of fresh rosemary and oregano. I also added about .5 lb browned hot Italian sausage. I used a 10\" skillet (not cast iron) that was about 3\" deep, and cooked it for ~32 minutes which created a nice crust while being set in the middle. The result was hearty, flavorful and delicious. I will definitely make this again. Oakland7/16/2020Absolutely delicious! I love this as a healthier, gluten-free option to traditional stuffing, it works as a side dish alongside pretty much anything or even a main course if you're willing (like me) to pile it on thick on your plate. I used a heap of rosemary for the herbs with significantly less thyme and it worked out perfectly. Only modification I'd make is to not put the whole 1/4 cup of olive oil in the pan to start with. Maybe I was just using a smaller skillet than I should've been, but it was impossible for my mushrooms to crisp up with so much liquid in the pan. Just enough to lightly cover the bottom of your skillet will be fine.heyguysitsmerobNorth Carolina5/22/2020Loved it. I used half sage, 1/4 thyme and 3/4 rosemary. Delicious!! Leftovers not so great, so use it up fresh!!quetalmichelleNashville1/8/2020LOVED this. A few things I changed: used pickled shallots instead of onions (put them in right before baking instead of cooking beforehand) which added some acid relief from the richness, and used oat milk with lemon instead of buttermilk (didn\u2019t have buttermilk). I also used coarse ground cornmeal which gave such a lovely texture and crunch. Great as a side dish or as a full meal, depending on your vibe. This will be a staple in my house!! AnonymousSanta Barbara12/25/2019For Anonymous in LA - you simply can NOT substitute Pyrex for a cast iron skillet! Especially for a dish like this - it will never \"crisp up.\" This was wonderful and a great idea. I had been using a recipe that called for me to make the cornmeal with broth (polenta style) then bake mixed with all the (already sauteed) veggies - and while that is delicious, this is so much more Thanksgivingy. Next time I will try Anonymous in Asheville's partial substitution of corn flour & Bob's GF flour.AnonymousNew England12/1/2019I really enjoyed this dish, especially the roasted onions and kale.  I also liked the cornbread crust that formed where the corn bread mixture came into contact with the hot skillet.  My only compliant is that I wish there was more of the crispy corn bread crust.  I may try this recipe again with muffin tins to get more crust surface area. Also, I cut the ingredients in half to make 4 servings and used a 12\" cast iron skillet.  I baked in the oven for 20 minutes rather than 25-30 minutes stated in the recipe. AnonymousBakersfield11/30/2019Good recipe but not quite as amazing as we had hoped. Made this yesterday but doubled for 22 people, and it was enough. We had to do it in two large pyrex, so perhaps we didn't get the full flavor. Very tasty but a bit greasy with all the sauteed vegetables. I might do it more lightly next time: steam, press and chop the kale and just toss with a little oil, and less oil in the mushrooms (which soak it up). AnonymousLos Angeles11/29/2019Delicious! Tastes like Thanksgiving in a skillet. Easy to make. Super satisfying as a vegetarian main dish. For the cornmeal, we used 1/3 medium grind cornmeal, 1/3 corn flour (aka finely ground), and 1/3 Bob\u2019s 1 to 1 gluten free baking flour as my husband isn\u2019t keen on super gritty cornbread and it turned out beautifully.\n\nP.s.

I made this in my 10 inch cast iron\u2014everything fit fine but I had to bake for roughly 10 min longer. Your results may vary! I drizzled a bit of honey over the top before serving and everyone at my friendsgiving devoured it. AnonymousNew York 11/25/2019Like this very much, and would definitely make again and again! \n\nAlso wanted to answer Julie\u2019s question about ways to make vegan. \nGo to Instagram, ForksOverKnives \u201cEasy Egg Swaps\u201d and you\u2019ll see several alternatives to using egg.AGram51California11/22/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titStuffingMaitake MushroomMushroomVegetableShiitake MushroomOyster MushroomCornmealFlourButtermilkOther IngredientsKaleLeafy GreensSideGluten-FreeNut-FreeVegetarianHealthyishThanksgivingDinnerRecipes you want to make.
