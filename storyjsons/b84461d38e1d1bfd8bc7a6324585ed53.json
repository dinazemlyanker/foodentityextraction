In some parts of Brooklyn, anyway, vegan ice creams now outnumber the cow-made stuff. And unlike the \u201970s era look that previously plagued these vegan options, the current roster of plant-based cartons looks goooood. But savvy branding doesn\u2019t always equal delicious, as I must remind myself. I love an arbitrary food challenge, so I set out to try as many nondairy ice creams as I could get my spoon into. My freezer got pretty chaotic, but I persevered through the too hard, too watery, and too banana-y to find the best vegan pints out there. Whether you\u2019re a fro-yo stan or an EVOO enthusiast or an eco-warrior looking to cut back on animal products, these have you covered.Sunscoop Vanilla Bean CreamI\u2019ve said it once and I\u2019ll say it again: This is the creamiest nondairy ice cream I\u2019ve ever had straight from the freezer. This particular flavor is made with a coconut cream base and takes me back, waaaaay back, to when I lived a block from a Pinkberry and spent 50 percent of my grad student budget on cups of tart fro-yo with li\u2019l mochi on top. Now I can spend $7 on this pint at the fancy bodega and feel young at heart.Photograph by Emma FishmanSunscoop$80 at Sunscoop (6 pints)$90 at Amazon (6 pints)$10 at Fresh Direct (1 pint)Runner-up: Toasted Coconut ButterWildgood MangoAs far as mouthfeel is concerned, Wildgood is a close second. And that makes sense, because Wildgood uses olive oil as the base in its fully nondairy line. If you\u2019ve ever topped your soft-serve with EVOO and flaky salt, you\u2019re probably as excited as I am about this new brand. I was expecting the savory undertones to work best with classics like chocolate and vanilla, but it was the mango I fell for. Have I become a \u201cfruity ice cream\u201d person after all these years?Photograph by Emma FishmanWildgood Mango$9 at WildgoodRunner-up: ChocolateCoconut Bliss Legendary Cookie DoughThe last time I tried Coconut Bliss, I was in my post-Pinkberry ~vegan phase~ and the packaging looked like that lower-back tattoo your friend got after her first yoga retreat. But now it\u2019s 2021, I\u2019m no longer vegan, and Coconut Bliss has rebranded its pints with bright Pixar-esque avatars! The only flavor I tried was cookie dough, and while I\u2019m not sure if it reaches \u201clegendary\u201d status, it\u2019s definitely the best nondairy version of the flavor I\u2019ve tried. And in case you\u2019re wondering, I\u2019m definitely that person who meticulously digs out all the (oat-flour based) cookie dough bits with a spoon.Photograph by Emma FishmanCoconut Bliss Legendary Cookie Dough$6 at Fresh Direct$9 at Coconut BlissOatly StrawberryI didn\u2019t think I liked strawberry ice cream until I tried Oatly\u2019s silky pink number, but I\u2019m a full convert now. The coffee flavor is ROBUST. The chocolate is more Hershey\u2019s Milk than fancy dark, which is nice. The vanilla tastes like cold oats, and I\u2019m not mad about it. What else is there to say? This Scandi brand is unstoppable.Photograph by Emma FishmanOatly Strawberry$8 at Fresh Direct$5 at TargetRunner-up: CoffeeN!ck\u2019s Vanilj BeanN!ck\u2019s branding makes me want to scream, \u201cWe get it! You\u2019re Swedish!\u201d The Oatly vibes, the \u201cSwedish-style light ice cream\u201d written prominently on certain labels, the insistence on calling the flavors by their Swedish names as if this were Ikea and not the frozen food aisle. As someone who is exactly one quarter Swedish, I feel that I can roll my eyes at all of this while also enjoying N!ck\u2019s wholeheartedly. Yes, it\u2019s \u201clight ice cream\u201d (including both vegan and non-vegan lines), but I believe there\u2019s a time and a place for such things, like when you\u2019re too busy screaming at the NBA refs to realize that you\u2019ve eaten an entire pint. But while other light ice creams rely solely on sugar alcohols like xylitol, which make my digestive system unhappy, N!ck\u2019s uses allulose, a lab-made version of a type of sugar that doesn\u2019t cause insulin spikes, in addition to erythritol, and I haven\u2019t noticed any digestive distress. As with all light ice cream, the more decadent options are bound to disappoint (Pean\u00f6t Butter Fudge is a shell of its full-fat, full-sugar self) but the vanilla\u2014I mean *Vanilj*\u2014is a refreshing delight.Photograph by Emma FishmanN!ck\u2019s Vanilj Bean$75 at N!ck's (6-Pack)Runner-up: Strawb\u00e4r Kr\u00e4mKIND Caramel Almond Sea SaltYou know them from airports, gas stations, and your mother\u2019s pantry: America\u2019s favorite mouthful of nuts in bar form now offers mouthfuls of nuts in ice cream form. The first ingredient is pear juice but I\u2019m not complaining! These pints pay homage to their predecessors in terms of sheer quantity of nuts, so rejoice, people who like to chew their ice cream. (If you\u2019re not on Team Chunky, try the strawberry flavor instead.) My favorite flavors were the ones that cut the nuts with swirls of caramel or peanut butter. These babies need a few minutes on the counter to get to a scoopable consistency, but they\u2019re worth the wait.Photograph by Isa Zapata\u00a0KIND Caramel Almond Sea Salt$7 at InstacartRunner-up: Dark Chocolate Peanut ButterExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingIce CreamVeganRecipes you want to make.
