Your in-the-know hipster cousin wants to pour something she\u2019s never tried before. Your mom is asking for a drink that\u2019s sweet (but not too sweet!). And your Grandma just needs a splash of something to settle her stomach. You know what they all want for a post-feast drink? They want Barolo Chinato. They just don\u2019t know it yet.This classic Italian after-dinner drink is made by infusing Barolo\u2014red wine made from Nebbiolo grapes grown in Italy\u2019s Piedmont region\u2014with dried herbs, barks, roots, fruits, and vegetables. The result is a sweet, spicy, vegetal wine that could just as easily be confused for vermouth as it could amaro. It doesn\u2019t matter what flavor you\u2019re looking for, you can find it in Barolo Chinato. Plus, at 16-19 percent ABV, a small glass isn\u2019t going to knock your guests off their chairs or send them into a slumber so deep you won\u2019t be able to get them off the couch.When it comes to producers, Pio Cesare makes exactly what I want from Barolo Chinato, with flavors of dark red fruit (think dried cherries and dates) and tannic, palate-cleansing herbs and barks that let your brain and your tastebuds know your feast has finished. At $95, it comes with a price, but if you\u2019re gonna splurge on a bottle for Thanksgiving, I cannot stress enough that this should be it. If it\u2019s not in the budget, Cappellano Barolo Chinato ($75), Barale Fratelli Barolo Chinato ($42), and Cocchi Barolo Chinato ($44) will also do just fine.Regardless of which bottle you snag, the real appeal of a digestivo like Barolo Chinato is that after a huge day of cooking, all you need to do is put out some rocks glasses, a bowl of ice cubes, and the bottle. No mixing. No stirring. Just let your friends and family members who want a drink pour one for themselves (they don\u2019t even need the ice if they want it neat!). You\u2019ve stressed for days (weeks!) about dinner. You don\u2019t need to stress about this.Explore Bon App\u00e9titThanksgivingRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
