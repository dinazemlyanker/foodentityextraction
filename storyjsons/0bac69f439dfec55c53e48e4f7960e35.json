I guess if you like peanut butter rice, this is for you.  Lamb gets totally lost, no point in even adding it.  I can see maybe making this without the peanut butter but adding chopped peanuts?wdAnn Arbor, MI3/7/2022Way too much peanut butter. The flavor combination of lamb, fish sauce, and peanut butter did not taste good. Kind of made me feel sick.  This was disappointing and felt like a waste of ingredients and time.MUCSan Francisco, CA2/1/2022Way too much peanut butter. Not enough liquid to cook the rice. There are major flaws with this recipe. What a waste.JoeSt. Louis, MO1/27/2022If you're looking for a recipe that will have your family begging you not to make dinner for awhile, this is it.Christine Brooklyn, NY1/24/2022Despite the other reviews, I really liked this recipe!\nThe tanginess of the tomatoes balanced the heavy peanut butter.\nBUT I do agree, too much peanut butter. I only added in 3 tablespoons.Sol halifax1/23/2022Somehow I missed in the recipe that this should have been made with cooked rice?  And agree- too much peanut butter Alison1/23/2022I have like or loved every dish on this website except for this one. The peanut flavor was overpowering; recommend to cut it in half.ScottBoston1/20/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titDinnerWest AfricanAfricanDairy-FreeGluten-FreeOkraVegetableLambMeatLamb ShoulderRiceRice & GrainsPeanutNutBlack-Eyed PeaBeanEggplantHabanero ChileChileScotch BonnetSimmerMainSideRecipes you want to make.
