There was Eric who played the guitar at my summer camp, Jared who was in all of the school plays with me, and Mike Delfino from Desperate Housewives. As I got older, my fantasies changed. Maybe I got more cynical, or maybe my priorities have just changed for the better, because now I dream of Win Son\u2019s fried eggplant. Trigg Brown, head chef at the Tawainese-American restaurant in Brooklyn, drew inspiration from the cold eggplant dishes you\u2019ll find in markets in Taiwan, where the nightshade is steamed, marinated, and then served next to century-egg frittatas. For his restaurant, he decided to serve it warm, fried in a rice flour dredge and then dusted with salt and MSG, plated with a swoosh of labne and Chinese five spice\u2013dusted cashews. The creamy-and-never-bitter interior paired with the light fry on the exterior makes the dish alarmingly addictive\u2014kind of like the rest of the food the very inventive Win Son turns out. But in terms of dishes to dream about, the eggplant is my No. 1\u2014and the real reason you\u2019ll hear me throwing the restaurant into the pool of \u201cso where are we going for dinner tonight?\u201d options every.
