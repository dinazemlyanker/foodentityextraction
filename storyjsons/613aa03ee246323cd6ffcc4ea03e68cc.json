Everything gets coated in a spicy gochugaru paste before the kimchi is packed into jars and fermented at room temperature until it\u2019s perfectly tangy. (To make this recipe vegan, substitute fish sauce with 1 Tbsp. soy sauce, 2 tsp. white miso, and 1 tsp. water whisked together in a small bowl.) Burp your kimchi baby daily to let any built-up gases release, and give it a taste to see how the flavor gets tangier by the day. Once you\u2019re happy with the results, store the jars in the fridge and you\u2019ll have a spicy sidekick for grain bowls, eggs, and stews for weeks to come. Use it in any recipe that calls for kimchi, such as Inside\u2013Out Kimchi Grilled Cheese, Kimchi Lentil Stew With Poached Eggs, and Kimchi\u2013Sweet Potato Fritters. \u2014Diana YenAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Massage into leaves with your hands until cabbage starts to release its liquid. Pour in cold water to cover and let cabbage soak 1 hour.Step 2Drain cabbage, reserving 2 cups brining liquid. Rinse cabbage in 3 changes of water, then drain well and transfer back to bowl.Step 3Mix ginger, garlic, fish sauce, soy sauce, and sugar in a small bowl to form a smooth paste. Stir in gochugaru (use 2 Tbsp. for a mild kimchi and up to 5 Tbsp. for an extra-spicy one).Step 4Add paste, scallions, and mixed vegetables to bowl with cabbage. Toss everything together with your hands (foodsafe gloves are welcome here) until cabbage and vegetables are evenly coated with paste.Step 5Tightly pack kimchi into jars, pressing down firmly to eliminate air bubbles and release more liquid from vegetables, leaving 1\" headspace at the top. If there isn\u2019t enough liquid to completely submerge vegetables, top off with reserved cabbage brine. Cover jars tightly with lids and let sit at room temperature away from direct sunlight, opening jars to let gases release once a day,\u00a0for at least 1 day and up to 5 days to ferment (the longer the kimchi sits, the more sour it will be). Give kimchi a taste as you go and add a splash of fish sauce or soy sauce as needed. Once you\u2019re satisfied with the flavor, transfer jars to the refrigerator, where the kimchi will continue to slowly age.Do ahead: Kimchi can be made 1 month ahead.
