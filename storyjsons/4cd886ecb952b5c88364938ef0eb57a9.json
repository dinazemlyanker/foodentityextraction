In this twist on baccal\u00e0 arrancanato, a salt cod dish popular in Molise along the Adriatic coast of Italy, fresh cod gets a boost from a handful of pantry staples such as breadcrumbs, raisins, and lemon. A healthy pour of olive oil gives the fish some needed richness while a splash of white wine helps to create just enough sauciness. A minute or two under the broiler at the end makes the nutty, raisin-studded breadcrumb topping golden, crunchy, and quite delicious. Since fresh cod doesn\u2019t require soaking like salt cod, this recipe is ideal for a weeknight meal served with rice. \u2014Anna GassAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Substituted dates for raisins and estragon for oregano.  Also drizzled on the olive oil just before broiling \u2026 I tend to burn things.  Just right.AnonymousLuxembourg 2/2/2022The raisins were surprisingly good in the dish, but it lacked some defining flavor, in my opinion.AnonymousLos Angeles2/1/2022Will try it soon, but might sub olives for the raisins.
