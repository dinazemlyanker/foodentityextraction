When something\u2019s so easy to make that you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.In what feels like another lifetime, I was a bright-eyed student in a Tokyo suburb, living my absolute best life. Several months into the study abroad program, though, I started feeling homesick\u2014not for anything in particular, just for something comforting. I was living alone in my own apartment, being as self-sufficient and responsible as any college student could be, clubbing on weekends and making the occasional bad choice, like drinking tequila and dancing until it hurt to move.One weekend, my friend Matt invited me over for pre-club dinner with his host parents, the Watanabes. I\u2019d shared a few dinners with friends\u2019 host parents at this point, but this was the first time I was asked to help cook. We were going to be making udon gyoza, and Mrs. Watanabe put me right to work slicing scallions. Mrs. Watanabe prepped everything else while Mr. Watanabe showed Matt how to peel apples while keeping the peel in one piece.Once we finished prep, Mrs. Watanabe sent us all to the dining room to snack on apples and drink beer while she finished up in the kitchen. A beer or two later, she came into the room with a platter of beautiful golden brown patties. As I told Mrs. Watanabe, they immediately became one of the best dishes I\u2019d eaten since arriving in Japan. She laughed it off, saying they were nothing special, just a basic Japanese homestyle recipe she\u2019d made hundreds of times.But more than how great they tasted, this low-effort, inexpensive meal encompassed what I\u2019d been missing about home\u2014people coming together to cook a meal, sharing stories, laughing. It didn\u2019t matter that none of us were related because in that moment, we were a little family, right down to their parental advice to \u201cnever stop experiencing new things and challenging yourselves\u201d and their wave goodbye, telling us to have fun and be careful.Thirteen years later, I\u2019m still trying new things, but whenever I need something hearty and comforting, I find myself circling back to this recipe. Here\u2019s how to make it:Thaw 1 pound frozen udon noodles, then chop them into roughly 1-inch pieces. Add the chopped noodles to a large bowl, along with 1 pound ground pork, 2 eggs, \u00bc cup thinly sliced scallions, 1 Tbsp. soy sauce, and \u00bc cup potato starch (I\u2019ve found that cornstarch and all-purpose flour work too). I usually add 2 cloves garlic, grated, and about 1 Tbsp. freshly grated ginger, but feel free to adjust those amounts to your preference.Once all the ingredients are in the bowl, mix with your hands until well incorporated. Heat 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Using a standard ice cream scoop or a \u00bc-cup measure, measure out balls of the udon gyoza mixture. Flatten each ball into a \u00bd-inch thick patty in the palms of your hands, then place four to five patties in the hot skillet, taking care not to crowd the pan. Cover the skillet, and cook for 5 minutes, undisturbed, until deep golden brown. Flip the udon gyoza and cook, uncovered, for an additional 3 minutes, until cooked through. Serve with a dipping sauce made of equal parts soy sauce or ponzu and black vinegar, and as much rayu as you like.Though we ate them as a meal that night, the Watanabes said they\u2019re good as a snack or appetizer, or even served cold the next day in a bento box. I can\u2019t really speak to how they are leftovers, though. No matter how many of these I make, they never seem to make it through the night.Jarrett Melendez is a graphic novel writer and former cook living in Boston with his partner Stuart, and their collection of plush pigs.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That Simple UdonPorkJapaneseSoy SauceRead MorecookingMore Nori Nut Mix, PLEASEBy Sarah JampelcookingGyeran Bap is What\u2019s For Lunch (or Breakfast or Dinner) When You Can\u2019t Be BotheredBy Joy ChocookingKoshari Is the Cozy Pile of Carbs I Make to Clean Out the FridgeBy Sohla El-WayllycookingI Make This Spicy Korean Fish Stew When I Just Need to Sweat It OutBy Paul WangRecipes you want to make.
