Assemble it in the morning, and when lunchtime comes around, the peppery mustard greens will have become tender and mild, while the bread and mozzarella will have soaked up the briny olive vinaigrette. It can hang out and get squished in the bottom of your bag for hours and will taste all the better for it. (For extra protection from vinaigrette spillage, place in a reusable plastic bag first.)

It's the best sandwich I've ever made. Everything held up in the fridge (the beans, the greens). I got good mozz but couldn't get good provolone and it was better than fine. I ate one every day last week monday-thursday and still want one more. Truly made my workday better.JessaminRaleigh, NC2/21/2022I love meat, I often eat it with all three meals, and even for snakes in between. I was a little cautious of this sandwich but it\u2019s amazing. It does more than hold its own, it shines brightly. It doesn\u2019t get soggy and it\u2019s got such a delicious  and unique flavor. Defiantly one of my favorite go to sandwiches. KrugDallas2/20/2022Y\u2019all need to repost this so people make it during the summer for outdoor physically distanced adventures or backyard picnics. It\u2019s amazing. I made it using a round boule loaf and arugula from my garden, because that\u2019s what I had and it\u2019s a pandemic substitution. Everything else was available from my fridge or pantry. We have one vegetarian household member who was thrilled to finally have a delicious meat free sandwich, and we were all very happy with the flavor components. Other meat free sandwich recipes, like eggplant, have been disappointingly bland and boring. I suggest one could even eat the bean and olives mixed together as a salad over greens, if you didn\u2019t have or want the bread. I did drizzle a bit of olive oil on the top bread piece, just to give it a little more cohesion with the rest of the layers. Would totally make again!AnonymousSWFL7/8/2020SO good! I made the beans ahead and constructed my sandwich for lunch two days in a row. I\u2019ll definitely make this again AnonymousAustin5/6/2020Excellent sandwich...but living in California I just had to add Jalape\u00f1o peppers and Cilentro. When my Broccoli is in the garden I will use the leaves with the Kale.  Very adaptable sandwich. Northern California in the Country.3/12/2020This was so so so yummy! I was skeptical that the components would be soggy by the time lunch came around but it was perfect! I will definitely be making this again!AlyCMend12/7/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titSandwichCheeseMozzarellaBeanVegetableCannellini BeanWhite BeanMustard GreensLeafy GreensQuickEasyVegetarianNut-FreeLunchRecipes you want to make.
