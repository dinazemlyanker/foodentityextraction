Schwartz\u2019s has a cult following for a reason.ORDER THE: smoked meat sandwich, duh. It\u2019s Canada\u2019s answer to pastrami: the meat is piled high, slicked with deli mustard and nothing else, and served on untoasted rye. It\u2019s out of this world. Order a side of pickles and coleslaw to balance out all that meaty richness and call it a day. Sure, there are other items on the menu, but 95 percent of the people here are getting the sandwich (in other words, skip the poutine).WORD TO THE WISE: The lines are INSANE, wrapping around the block even when it\u2019s minus-10 degrees outside. Your best bet is to go off-hours between the lunch and dinner rush, or order a sandwich to-go from the adjacent take-out shop. The food will taste the same, but you won\u2019t get the full experience.THE VIBE: is old-school, a turn-and-burn deli counter. It\u2019s been around since 1928 and the decor hasn\u2019t changed since (menus plastered on the walls, paper placemats).PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day: Sunday to Thursday 8 a.m. to 12:30 a.m., Friday 8 a.m. to 1:30 a.m., and Saturday 8 a.m. to 2:30 a.m.\u2014Molly BazPhoto by Dominique LafondPhoto by Dominique LafondWE ALSO LOVERotisserie RomadosThe Plateau\u2019s mouthwatering Portuguese piri-piri chicken (and egg tarts!)L\u2019ExpressWhen you want the French bistro classics, you go to this Plateau institutionPatisserie Au Kouign-AmannA carby, sugary haven in the PlateauExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
