I give it to all my friends. I bring it to every party. I put it on every cheese board. That\u2019s because Bonnie\u2019s Peach Ginger Jam is the best thing in the world.I\u2019m not a huge peach preserves person\u2014they can be too gloopy and sweet\u2014but this jam has a little bit of candied ginger, which gives it some complexity and the perfect amount of heat to keep me going back for more. I discovered it while shopping at Whole Foods, and since I\u2019m an art director, I was obviously judging all the jams by their labels. Once I saw Bonnie\u2019s, I loved how simple the jam label looked with its thin-lined script and white label, sort of minimal for the jam world. So I bought it, and I\u2019ve been hooked ever since.Whenever I have this jam at home, it\u2019s like nothing else exists in my kitchen. Even if I bought some ingredients to make dinner, I\u2019ll always spoil my appetite by eating too much of this jam on whatever I can find\u2014rice cakes, Ritz crackers, matzo, toasted bread, water crackers, an entire baguette. It takes me only two days to go through the jar. I\u2019ll just plow through it. But one of my favorite ways to eat it is on a cheese board. Just cut up some pears, brie, and manchego, and stock up on two jars. Trust me, it will go fast.Buy it: Bonnie\u2019s Peach Ginger Jam, $10 at Bonnie\u2019s JamsAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
