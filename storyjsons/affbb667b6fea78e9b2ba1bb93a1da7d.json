In her monthly column, nearly lifelong vegetarian Sarah Jampel will tackle cooking, eating, and navigating the world meat-free\u2014even when her grandma still doesn't know what she makes for dinner.It\u2019s easier to talk about fake meat in terms of what it isn\u2019t (um, meat) than what it is (um, I\u2019m not sure). I couldn\u2019t tell you how seitan is made (or the appropriate way to pronounce it), but I can tell you that I\u2019ve always been equally intrigued and put-off by things like \u201cchicken\u201d fingers, fake bacon, tofu dogs. Yes, the concept of an easy-to-prepare vegetarian meat stand-in is appealing, but I usually end up wondering whether these highly processed, heavily packaged imitations are worth their convenience.And yet sometimes I want a vegetarian protein that doesn\u2019t need to be pressed or pan-fried to taste its best. Sometimes I want a vegetarian alt for ground meat that will be ready in a matter of minutes. And sometimes, dear God, all I want is to recreate my favorite order from Claire\u2019s Corner Copia in New Haven, CT: Caesar salad with buffalo soy chicken strips.And that, my friends, is where Butler Foods\u2019 soy curls come in. I first learned about soy curls from vegan cookbook author Gena Hamshaw. Rich in fiber and protein, soy curls are made of non-GMO soybeans that are processed without chemicals and packaged with neither additives nor preservatives\u2026and they taste kind of like chicken! Unlike TVP (textured vegetable protein), which is made by pressure-cooking and drying defatted soybean flour, these curls are made from the whole beans and thus contain all of their fiber and protein.They come dehydrated, resembling desiccated mushroom stems. But after a 10-minute soak\u2014even better if it\u2019s in a flavorful liquid, like broth or dashi\u2014the curls plump up into squidgy strands. Just gently squeeze out any excess liquid before cooking. I like to saut\u00e9 them in a hot pan with spiced olive oil (smoked paprika, garam masala, vadouvan, or za'atar) so that they get crispy and golden-brown on the outside but remain chewy and buttery within. I\u2019ll put them on top of a salad, tuck them into a sandwich or wrap, or just eat them on their own. Soy curls can be the foundation of a stir-fry or, if you chop them up finely after they\u2019re soaked, larb. And\u2014this sentence is going to sound like a parody\u2014I can\u2019t wait to put soy curls in my spicy lettuce wraps this summer. (Need more ideas? Browse the 900+ Amazon reviews!)The one downside with soy curls is that they\u2019re not so easy to track down: Only a handful of stores in most states carry them. But you can order them online (and, if you\u2019re like me, you can order three\u2014or even six!\u2014bags at a time). If you\u2019re a vegetarian who\u2019s been waiting years for a meat-free product to turn into buffalo \u201cchicken\u201d that\u2019s also made of ingredients you can pronounce, a few days of waiting will feel like nothing. After all, there\u2019s a lifetime of soy curl enjoyment in your future.Buy it: Butler Foods Soy Curls, $7 for 8 ouncesAll products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
