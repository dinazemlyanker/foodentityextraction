There\u2019s the menu, so thick and full of options you might never get past the appetizer selections before your meal arrives. Or the decor, complete with Egyptian columns, wood paneling, and textured walls, which both surprises and delights with its miss-matched opulent styles. Not to mention the food, so great in its portions and caloric in its ingredients, and yet delightfully consistent. Don\u2019t even get us started on the star of the show: the cheesecake itself. But the underdog of the whole meal, the Cheesecake Factory\u2019s Famous Brown Bread, is finally getting its day in the spotlight.According to Food & Wine magazine, the rolls will now be available in the Factory\u2019s online store and in grocery stores. Lest anyone think that the Factory does not provide for its loyal fans, three versions of brown bread will be available: heat-and-serve dinner rolls and mini-baguettes, as well as pre-cut sandwich loaves. But the best part of being able to purchase packaged Cheesecake bread? Learning the mysterious ingredients, which reportedly include cream cheese, semi-sweet chocolate chips, and powdered sugar.The Factory also already sells box mixes of baked goods,  like brownies, cookies, and cakes, but unfortunately, the secret recipe to its classic cheesecake remains an enigma. For now, we\u2019ll just fill our stomachs with at-home brown bread.The Cheesecake FactoryThe Cheesecake FactoryThe Cheesecake FactoryRelated: Cheesecake Factory Adds Funfetti Cake to MenuExplore Bon App\u00e9titCheesecakeBreadTrendsRead MorecultureThe Cheesecake Factory Combines a Pumpkin and Pecan Pie In One Glorious CheesecakeBy Julia BlackLifestyleShould American Health Care Be More Like The Cheesecake Factory?By Sam DeanrestaurantsCheesecake Factory Comes To New York, We Get An Early Taste of GreatnessBy Michelle CollinsRecipes you want to make.
