The slabs get super-tender, and the loose pieces of florets get browned and crunchy. If the pan is dry, you\u2019ll risk burning instead of browning. Add oil as needed to keep things sizzling. This recipe is from Where Cooking Begins by Carla Lalli Music.Ingredients4 servings1medium head of Romanesco or cauliflower (about 2 lb.), trimmedKosher salt2Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling2Tbsp. unsalted butter\u00bccup skin-on or blanched hazelnuts, coarsely chopped2garlic cloves, thinly sliced\u00bdcup chopped parsley2tsp. white wine vinegarFlaky sea saltLemon wedges (for serving)PreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 400\u00b0. Stand Romanesco on its stem and cut it from top to bottom into 1\"-thick slabs. Don\u2019t worry about the outer edges that may crumble or smaller florets that break away; nudge those into a pile along with any nice-looking leaves. Cut loose bits into \u00bd\" pieces; season bits and Romanesco steaks with kosher salt.Step 2Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Add 2 Tbsp. oil and slip Romanesco steaks into pan\u2014puzzle them together so they don\u2019t overlap; work in batches if needed. Cook, rotating skillet periodically for even browning, until dark brown underneath, about 5 minutes. Turn and drizzle a bit of oil over second sides and into empty areas of pan. Scatter chopped pieces of Romanesco into spaces between steaks and toss gently to coat with oil (add more if needed).Step 3Transfer pan to oven; roast Romanesco until a tester inserted into stems slips through without much effort, 15\u201318 minutes. Steaks should be firm enough to still hold together without being crunchy.Step 4Transfer steaks to a platter. Return pan with loose pieces of Romanesco to medium-high heat. Add butter, hazelnuts, and garlic, and cook, stirring, until everything is toasted and crisp around the edges, about 4 minutes. Add parsley and vinegar and stir up any browned bits. Spoon over steaks and season with sea salt.

I otherwise followed the recipe and served on a bed of rainbow chard tossed with lemon, honey, and olive oil.  Absolutely delicious, and I bet even better with hazelnuts.AnonymousNew York, NY1/12/2022Best BA recipe. Minus a star because instructions omit important ingredient: foolproof Rx for burned hand that results from grasping 400 degree pan while tossing crispy bits. Please add: cold prepared yellow mustard to slather on palm and fingertips.AnonymousBaltimore12/24/2021This sounds DELICIOUS but I only gave 3 stars because I need nutritional breakdown on all the things I make. Have to discontinue my BA subscription because this info isn\u2019t given <sad face>OlliePort Townsend, WA9/25/2021I bought some romanesco on a whim, simply because it was beautiful. I had never cooked or eaten it before but I figured it would be similar to broccoli or cauliflower. I cooked it for the first time using this recipe. So fricken delicious. I like it better than broccoli or cauliflower now. I saved this recipe for future use because it\u2019s so gotdang good. DevSanta Clarita2/23/2021This is SOOOOOO good! Best vegetable/plant-based dinner ever. Comes together quickly, and bursting with flavor and texture. Sweet and salty -- could add some pomegranate on top too for a nice bright garnish. I was so pleasantly surprised at how delicious this was!!! JanisIrvine, CA2/5/2021Everybody loved it! I didn\u2019t have hazelnuts or White wine vinegar , used pistachios and red wine vinegar insteadLjeanCChicago, IL12/13/2020Swapped the hazelnuts for some pancetta which I rendered before browning the romanescoAnonymousMoscow, Russia5/28/2020This was great. I cooked some purple onion with the crispy bits and the sweetness added a nice contrast and balance to the savory flavors. sprokolopolisLos Angeles, CA6/18/2019Great recipe.
