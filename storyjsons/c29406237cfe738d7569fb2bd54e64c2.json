(I can implicate my colleague Hilary Cadigan\u2014also guilty as charged.)Purists can hate on edible glitter all they want, but they can\u2019t deny that it turns otherwise regular old \u2018doodles into party doodles. Fashion doodles, even! And come to think of it, a dusting of glitter could take nearly all doodles\u2014Golden Doodles, Labradoodles, Saint Berdoodles (yes, they\u2019re a thing)\u2014from monochromatic to dynamic.As someone who received one tube of pink facial glitter from my cool babysitter when I was eight, then used pea-sized drops on my nonexistent cheekbones for the next ten years (and only on the most special occasions), I\u2019ll gladly admit that I\u2019m as attracted to glitter as the next silly human. Oooh, sparkly! is just about the only thought that goes through my head when I see something that catches the light in the right way.These churros have lots of sparkle, without the funny business.\nPhoto by Laura Murray, Styling by Judy ManciniWhile these snickerdoodles certainly do not need glitter\u2014they already have lots of tricks, like cornflakes, cardamom, brown butter, Chris Morocco\u2019s blood, sweat, tears (a.k.a. \u201clove\u201d)\u2014their appearance certainly benefits from it. Edible glitter is the wellness serum that gives otherwise dull cookies that festive glow appropriate for a season alight with Christmas trees, Hanukkah candles, and your cell phone screen as you scroll mindlessly through the web before bed. It\u2019s glitter that makes them stand out at the cookie swap or holiday potluck before anyone\u2019s even had a chance to taste.But consumable glitter can\u2014and has, in many instances (see glitter lattes and gold wings)\u2014gone too far. Put simply, to use sparkles as a crutch is an abuse of their power. To judge whether glitter is a welcome accent rather than a hasty cover-up or just straight-up Instagram bait, I think about my romantic partner dressed up in a fancy outfit. I want to love the person (or food) whether or not it\u2019s adorned and I don\u2019t want the decoration to be so over-the-top that it makes the person (or food) off putting or unrecognizable. A bagel that looks like it\u2019s going to corrode my esophagus or a pizza that may or may not be molding is too much glitz: What\u2019s fun about questioning whether I'm about to incur bodily harm from a metallic sprinkle mix that\u2019s non-toxic but not necessarily edible? Where\u2019s the joy in setting myself up to, pardon my language, crap rainbows?Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.And there are plenty of ways, thank the iridescent angels above, to make food shine with none of these worries. Tell me morning buns or sugar-coated churros, or raspberry rugelach, which get their pink sequined look from a mix of freeze-dried berries and regular old sugar, aren\u2019t sparkly. Even steak looks like a gosh darn shooting star with a little help from flaky salt. The stuff we already have in the kitchen\u2014coarse sugar, confectioners\u2019 sugar, pyramidal salt\u2014makes food glitter and taste better without warnings from the FDA. Just look inside yourself (and your pantry!): You\u2019ve got all you need to sparkle just sitting in wait. You just have to unleash it.*But when you\u2019re grasping for a little extra holiday magic, you have my blessing\u2014for whatever that\u2019s worth\u2014to reach for the luster dust. Just make sure it\u2019s clearly labeled \u201cedible,\u201d okay?*And yes, I am available for all your inspirational speech needs.Explore Bon App\u00e9titTrendsRead MorecultureInstagram Feeding Frenzy: How 'Influencers' Are Changing the Food SceneBy Michelle RuizRecipes you want to make.
