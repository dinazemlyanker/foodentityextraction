I'm not a picky eater, quite the contrary, and I love trying many different foods and recipes. However, here the flavours just didn't go well together at all. I followed the recipe exactly. It's too sour from the lemon and super onion-y and other than that just bland (despite the salt) and just doesn't taste like much. Super disappointed. Really wanted to love this but this was a no for me.SarahCanada4/6/2021This has become a regular feature of my week night meals. I serve it in a flatbread sometimes with halloumi or yoghurt. \n\nIt's so easy and delicious. AnonymousLondon, UK11/26/2020I could eat this every day!  Added roasted red and yellow peppers, used honey.  I think the dressing would be great with a number of roasted vegetables, carrots especially.Carol de RuntzHuntington Beach, CA10/29/2020Terrible mix of flavors. Nearly ruined my relationship. Beware. Anonymous10/6/2020Did not enjoy this AT ALL.  There was way too much onion, and it's raw?  I reread the recipe a few times because I thought it was an error - with this much onion it should definitely be sauteed - the flavor was incredibly overpowering.  I didn't mind the sweet and spicy, but it also didn't do anything for me.  Many other better BA recipes for eggplant.AnonymousLos Angeles, CA9/30/2020Cinnamon + eggplant = nococomamaLos Angeles, CA9/16/2020About to make this delicious meal! Should I add garlic while cooking the eggplant or just leave the recipe  as is? AnonymousHouston Texas 9/15/2020Delish! Didn't have date syrup so i made a blend of maple syrup with balsamic vinegar (dont ask me why i did that haha). i played with the ratio of acids to oil in the dressing, as well as added in ACV and red wine vinegar into the mix - tasted along the way till i was satisfied. niccsuxSingapore7/16/2020My husband and I had the same reaction to this.  First bite - it's okay.  Second bite, it tasted even better.  By the fifth bite we were both raving about it.  Delicious blend of flavors, great variety of textures.  I cut back on the red pepper because we like a little spice, but not too much.  I've got mint growing wild all over our garden, so I'll be making this a lot this summer!  I couldn't find Japanese eggplant so I just used regular.  Thanks to Andy for this recipe!AnonymousColorado5/28/2020Omg. This was hands down the best salad I have EVER had in my mouth. I didn't have date syrup on hand so I swapped that for freshly squeezed orange mixed with a teaspoon of honey. It was heavenly. A new staple meal at my house!smultronbellaSweden3/30/2020Delicious meatless dinner. I used Japanese eggplants and squeezed orange juice instead of the date syrup. Can\u2019t wait to make and eat this again!AnonymousParis, France8/29/2019Tasted totally different from what I expected, I felt like my tastebuds were getting slapped in the face (in a really good way): it's kinda spicy, but tangy from the lemon, and then the cinnamon is there, but wait! Crunchy walnuts.....ohh man, such an exciting Monday dinner! ihatemuffinsWaco, TX6/4/2019This is the fanciest tasting thing I've ever made, literally tasted like I could have gotten it at some swanky restaurant... make this to impress your friendsAnonymousBrooklyn, NY4/2/2019Quick easy and delicious. I cooked the eggplant ahead of time and let it sit in the marinade. Added mint, walnuts, Aleppo pepper  and red onions. Topped with pomegranate molasses. Tangy and sweet. AnonymousNY10/11/2018Not the most salad-y salad but one of the tastiest I've ever made. I didn't have date syrup so used honey as suggested. Very, very delicious and cozy, exactly what I wanted on a rainy night. madmaddyGreenville, SC9/28/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladAmericanEggplantVegetableCinnamonHerbs & SpicesWalnutNutMintRed OnionOnionSideDairy-FreeGluten-FreeVegetarianVeganHealthyishSaut\u00e9Recipes you want to make.
