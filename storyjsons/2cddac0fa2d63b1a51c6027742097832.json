AnonymousSeattle, WA1/9/2022I love this drink! I don\u2019t like sweet, so if you are looking for even a little sweet read the title, read the ingredients, use reading comprehension and think carefully, oh this is salty and tastes like celery and preserved lemons (which also don\u2019t taste like fresh lemons). That being said, it\u2019s such a wonderful alternative to a Bloody Mary or some other day time drink, and I would also advise sticking to the recipe as well because it is really important to strain and also not overwhelm with the lemons or too much vodka.
