But also the oil that\u2019s left behind is a flavor-packed product all its own, just waiting to be whisked into sauces or turned into a cooking medium for the most aromatic fried rice that ever was. Dried-out cooked rice is the best option for stir-fries as the grains will get really crunchy.Ingredients4 servings8garlic cloves, thinly sliced\u2153cup grapeseed or vegetable oilKosher salt12\" piece ginger, peeled, finely chopped1large egg, beaten to blend3cups chilled cooked short-grain rice2tsp. toasted sesame oil4scallions, thinly sliced on a diagonal\u00becup coarsely chopped cilantro2tsp. toasted sesame seedsPreparationStep 1Toss garlic and grapeseed oil in a large nonstick skillet. Arrange garlic in a single layer and set over medium heat. Cook, shaking pan often, until garlic is barely golden and crisp (oil should stop bubbling at this point), about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer garlic chips to paper towels to drain; season with salt.Step 2Increase heat to medium-high and cook ginger in oil in the same skillet, stirring occasionally, until just softened and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add egg and stir to break up; cook until just set (this will take a matter of seconds). Add rice and sesame oil and toss to combine. Cook, undisturbed, pressing down on rice with a spatula so it makes good contact with the pan, until rice begins to crisp, about 2 minutes. Give rice a toss, then press down on it again, cooking until you get more crispy bits, about 2 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and toss in scallions and half of garlic chips; season with salt.Step 3Transfer fried rice to a platter and scatter cilantro, sesame seeds, and remaining garlic chips on top.Step 4Do Ahead: Garlic chips can be made 1 day ahead.

Simple, excellent flavors, pushed this non-reviewer to encourage EVERYONE to put this on their meal plan. Thanks Andy!KaylynTampa, FL12/29/2020Super easy recipe, and very yummy! Maybe my scallions were large, but I simply didn't need four?? More like 1 or 2 haha. Loved the dish :) Anonymouscalifornia 6/10/2020Love this recipe and shocked it doesn't have more reviews! It's soooo flavorful, savory, and just plain delicious. An easy and quick way to dress up some fried rice. I also like to finish it off with a big squeeze of lime and a dash of red pepper flakes. Have made it several times now... just wish I had a mini mandolin for the garlic. AnonymousFlorida4/16/2020Had doubts every step of the way but it was absolutely amazing.AnonymousNew Zealand 2/26/2020My husband and I loved this recipe! It comes together so quickly and it's absolutely delicious! I cut the recipe in half since there's just the two of us but soon I was wishing I made the full recipe! I'll definitely be making this again!Holly AltNew Berlin, WI7/12/2019Yes, yes, yes, a thousand times YES! This was amazing! I let it cook longer for maximum crunchiness and it was so delicious. Not a great keeper for leftovers though unless you were to re-fry it. AnonymousFlorida2/19/2019This was excellent and my family raved about it. I kept things simple by going tony local Chinese food place and getting a large order of white rice. The trickiest part is getting the garlic to not burn. You have to keep a sharp eye on it and take it out as soon as you start to see a little bit of color on it otherwise it will burn. Will def make again. AnonymousNyack, NY2/7/2019Absolutely delicious! I decided to try this on a whim and ended up eating it all myself! I made more for dinner and even my mother loved it, she is very picky. Hands down the best garlic fried rice recipe :)JellykupCalifornia10/31/2018This was amazing! Really takes rice to the next level. Fed to a family of 8 and they all loved it. Will be making again and again! lilamadeleineAustin, Tx10/23/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titFried RiceChineseEast AsianAsianGarlicVegetableGingerHerbs & SpicesScallionOnionWeeknight MealsEasyQuickOne-Pot MealsSideMainDairy-FreeSaut\u00e9LunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
