Typically a dipping sauce, nuoc cham is used in a variety of ways in Vietnamese cooking, which inspired the tangy, sweet, and salty condiment\u2019s use as a dressing in this recipe. \u2014Rachel GurjarAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Flavors and textures work incredibly well together.  Don't skip grilling the corn - that charred flavor really makes the dish.Jackie MMadison, WI9/11/2021This was really good!  Fast, easy and delicious.  I used leftover corn on the cob (about 2.5-3 cups of kernels cut off the cob) and just charred it a little in a frying pan.  I also had fresh small purple plums with yellow flesh so I used more and they were great.  I only had a jalape\u00f1o pepper, but that worked well too.  The farro gave it a nice chewy texture.  I served it as a main course on a bed of arugula with a bit of leftover grilled mint chicken sliced up on top, but it would be great on its own.LizOttawa, ON8/24/2021This was an amazing dish! The flavor is fantastic and it looked  gorgeous for our dinner party! I cannot wait to make it again and I wouldn\u2019t change a thing.AlisonColorado 8/23/2021Excellent, we used some local peaches and it was amazingAnonymous8/11/2021Delicious! My husband said it was \u201crestaurant quality\u2026no, really good restaurant quality\u201d. I only did one pepper (with seeds) and added some arugula in at the end, but otherwise followed the directions exactly. I found a recipe for a Thai inspired marinade and grilled some chicken on the side. Will definitely make again!Samantha Los Angeles, CA8/2/2021This is good and the flavors develop really well as it sits in the fridge. I often love to eat a side dish for dinner but for me, even after swapping in quinoa for farro, this was crying out for a protein. I added some quick fried tofu on top and it brought the whole thing to life. The interplay of the grilled corn was fun with the plum!AnonymousChicago7/9/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladFarroRice & GrainsCornVegetablePlumStone FruitFruitThai ChileChileSummerSideDairy-FreeNut-FreeDinnerRecipes you want to make.
