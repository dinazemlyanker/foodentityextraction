Small treats are just as important when you\u2019re eating clean and maybe even more so, and they don\u2019t need to be totally unhealthy. Just a little bit unhealthy.I set out to develop a recipe for a cleaner chocolate mousse by cutting out dairy and processed sugars. The one thing I refused to do: compromise on flavor. Enter vegan chocolate mousse. It might sound suspicious, but take a look-see at the short and sweet ingredient list, and you\u2019ll notice that it\u2019s comprised of only the most delicious things. Made with aquafaba (yes, the liquid left over from your can of chickpeas), bittersweet chocolate, coconut cream, and coconut sugar, there\u2019s nothing not to like about this simple dessert.The recipe unfolds much like any chocolate mousse recipe, with the exception of that \u201caquafaba,\u201d that famed byproduct of the chickpea, which can do magical things. The aquafaba is beaten until voluminous and stiff-peaked, then folded into melted chocolate (look for a vegan chocolate bar if you want this to be fully dairy-free) that has been sweetened with coconut sugar and made creamy by the addition of coconut cream.The mixture then gets divided among ramekins, set to chill, and topped with a dollop of whipped and sweetened coconut cream. A final sprinkling of coconut sugar is the finishing touch.  The recipe leaves you with six-single serving portions for when you\u2019re feeling selfish (and you should be). They\u2019ll last you all week and curb that nightly chocolate craving.  But, of course, if you\u2019d rather share, this is a healthyish twist on a classic dinner party dessert.With an active cooking time of about 15 minutes and an ingredient list that can be counted on one hand, there\u2019s very little standing in the way of you and a creamy, coconut-y vegan chocolate mousse that\u2019s the perfect way to end a mid-January (or any time) meal.Get the recipe:Coconut-Chocolate MousseChoose a chocolate that does not exceed 64% cacao for a mousse with the smoothest texture. If you want the mousse to be fully non-dairy, look for a vegan chocolate bar, though the flavor may differ slightly.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishFeel Good Food PlanDessertHealthy DessertsMousseChocolateDark ChocolateCoconut CreamCoconutVeganRead MorecookingThis Roasted Broccoli Recipe Indulges All My Food ObsessionsBy Elaheh NozariRecipes you want to make.
