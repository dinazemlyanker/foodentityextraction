This time around: how to wash the dishes.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we have a dishwasher?\u201d I used to whine at my mother, to which she would cackle\u2014elbows deep in a sudsy sink, eyes darting between me and my big brother\u2014and respond: \u201cI already have two dishwashers.\u201dWhen I finally moved into my own apartment, those long nights spent scrubbing dishes with travel-themed towels far behind me, I was utterly enamored by the giant silver cube in my kitchen. But I did not know how to use it. What is this oddly satisfying cage thing for? Is it safe to put in my wine glasses? Must I rinse first? Heck, are these dishes even clean?Without solid advice, I fumbled my way through, warping wooden boards, blunting sharp knives, opening it after the cycle ended to find most of the dishes weren\u2019t very, uh, clean. But while dishwasher roulette may be a fun game for a 19-year-old, you\u2019re probably using your machine more than ever\u2014and now\u2019s a good time to learn how to make sure it\u2019s serving you well. Follow these foolproof guidelines:1. Pre-rinsing? Not necessary.Parents everywhere: earmuffs. If you\u2019re planning on leaving your dirties in the machine for a while, however, you can run the rinse-only cycle to stifle gross odors. It\u2019s more water-efficient than rinsing by hand, and will prevent dish-appointment (that feeling when you open the machine only to find crusted on bolognese and filmy water spots everywhere). But if you\u2019ve got a full load ready to go, scrape off the serious gunk and bits of food, hit start, and don\u2019t look back. If you're stuck with an older model and you've noticed it can't do its job, rinse away\u2014you know what works for your machine.2. Note the hard NOs.Don\u2019t dish-wash sharp knives, which will dull. (Butter knives are fine because they are already kinda dull.) Wooden items, like spoons and cutting boards, could warp or crack, so keep them out. Pans, especially of the nonstick variety, don\u2019t belong\u2014they\u2019re bulky and damage-prone. Those twisty reusable straws? Asking for trouble. Essentially, the cardinal rule is this: Don\u2019t put anything in there that you couldn\u2019t (or wouldn\u2019t want to) replace\u2014ceramics, family heirlooms, fine china.3. Keep your utensils together, but not too together.For the most powerful wash, position the tines (sharp doodads) of forks and the bowls of spoons sticking up. And keep knife blades stabbing downwards (for safety). Remember, we\u2019re social distancing: For the water to properly clean every surface, and to minimize scratches, don\u2019t cram too many utensils into the basket at once. Spoons have a tendency to, well, spoon, so try to keep them in different compartments.4. Location, location, location.Load from back to front to fit in more stuff. Unload from bottom to top so you don\u2019t drip on your dry dishes. Thin plastics (like quart containers and takeout bowls) should live on the top rack to prevent them from melting. And be sure to batten the hatches: Rogue plastic bits tend to drop to the bottom, where it\u2019s hotter. Place bowls and cups facedown or at an angle so they don\u2019t harbor puddles, and keep plates on the bottom shelf where the spray is strongest. Don\u2019t nest things like Russian dolls; if the water can\u2019t reach something, it won\u2019t be cleaned.5. Never wonder if it\u2019s clean or if it\u2019s dirty again.Right after you empty the machine, add the detergent. That way, when you see the soap, you\u2019ll know it\u2019s ready to load. Magic! Also, a little detergent goes a long way. You can use less than the recommended amount if your dishes aren\u2019t too feral. Just don\u2019t use more than what\u2019s recommended in your user guide: That\u2019ll leave a filmy residue on your fancy glassware.6. Don\u2019t block the jets.At 1 a.m. it is very human to want to just shove your cookie sheet or lasagna pan onto the bottom rack and walk away. But you\u2019re going to block the spray arm. And that\u2019s like trying to dust your house by blowing on everything: You\u2019ll look dumb and you\u2019ll make matters worse. Big stuff goes on the sides, and needs to sit at an angle. (Like the cups, remember?)7. Always run it full.Please, for the love of our planet. But you knew that one already, right?Explore Bon App\u00e9titCleaningToolsCoronavirusRecipes you want to make.
