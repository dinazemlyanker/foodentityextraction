It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Here\u2019s what I should do when I get home, hungry, after a long day at work: Make this socca recipe.Here\u2019s what usually happens: I open the front door and my cat, Peggy, runs past me into the freedom of the great Brooklyn outdoors. I shut the door behind me, then yell for my children. I literally yell: \u201cChildren!\u201d I rarely get a response, and neither of them appear. I kick off my shoes. That\u2019s a signal for my other cat, King Jeffrey, to jump onto the counter, gaze purposefully at me with his spooky lizard-snake eyes, and telepathically message that he would like his dinner now.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Before I can even pour myself a tumbler of vino, I\u2019m fork-deep in wet food. That\u2019s Peggy\u2019s cue to jump back into the kitchen through the front window. My own children have no incentive to join us. They\u2019ve already been fed\u2014thanks to a meal plan I work out with our sitter. But what about my dinner?I\u2019ll be real. Sometimes my husband and I eat what is known as a \u201csnack-around plate.\u201d This is cheese, nuts, dried fruit, some salumi (if we have it), and a cut-up apple. Great stuff, if you\u2019re a toddler. There are nights when I eat the kid\u2019s leftovers, and nights when my husband and I talk about ordering in for so long that by the time we decide where to order from, I don\u2019t want dinner anymore. There are nights, Dear Reader, when I eat cereal for dinner.Pancakes in no time.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigSomehow, being the food director of Bon App\u00e9tit has equipped me with the knowledge of how to put together a great weeknight dinner but without the wherewithal to actually execute. I mean, once in a while I come up with a life-altering invention like Broccoli Delight, but the bulk of the time it\u2019s Refrigerator Blues. If I had my druthers, my dinner would be a quick-cooking something that goes from raw to perfection while I stand at the cutting board prepping a vegetable to go with it.That\u2019s where the chickpea flour pancake called socca comes in. It is protein-rich and filling, but unlike a pork chop or a salmon fillet, you don\u2019t have to remember to stop off at the store to buy it on the way home (except, of course, for the first time you purchase the flour). It turns into a batter with the addition of salt, olive oil, and water\u2014no eggs, even! And while that sits for 10 minutes hydrating, you can prepare any raw or cooked vegetable component your heart desires (or that your crisper drawer hasn\u2019t wilted yet).And there it is. A hot dinner, a quick dinner, a pantry-friendly dinner, the actual dinner I deserve. When my meal is ready, that\u2019s when the children appear, sniffing around to figure out the source of the enticing food smells they\u2019re smelling. \u201cOh,\u201d they say, \u201ccan we have our second dinner now?\u201dGet the recipe:Chickpea Pancakes with Kale and FennelSavory chickpea flour pancakes, also known as socca, require just four ingredients (including water).View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterChickpeaWeeknightRead MoreLifestyleChickpea Flour Is Your Fastest Route to Dinner TonightBy Aliza Abarbanelcooking4 Ways to Use Chickpea Flour, the Protein-Packed WonderBy Rick MartinezChickpea Pancakes with Leeks, Squash, and YogurtRecipes you want to make.
