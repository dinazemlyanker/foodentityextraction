She shared screen time with Susan Sarandon in Feud. And now she\u2019s number one on the call sheet for Netflix\u2019s The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. (Think: \u201990s series Sabrina the Teenage Witch, but with the same glam-noir filter as fellow Archie Comics phenomenon Riverdale.)If you follow Shipka on social media, chances are you already know she loves food. A lot. \u201cJonathan Gold was such an influential person in my life,\u201d she says. \u201cI really found my love of food through his lists.\u201d But when Shipka\u2019s not eating at L.A.\u2019s Petit Trois, Bavel, or Sqirl, you\u2019ll find her seasoning the cast iron in her kitchen. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing a little bit,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cI love roasting broccoli or making a nice piece of salmon; meat and vegetables are my things.\u201dMcGarry\u2014who\u2019s been darting back and forth between his cooks, peering into pans and adjusting knobs\u2014joins us in his kitchen. He first arrived in New York from California a few years ago to run his pop-up eatery, Eureka, but started charging money to serve food out of his mother\u2019s San Fernando Valley house when he was 13. The pair met in L.A. through a mutual friend (and some \u201caggressive Instagram stalking\u201d on Shipka\u2019s part), and have been close ever since.(And maybe now is the time to mention that uber-successful Shipka and McGarry are 19 and 20 respectively.)Shipka and McGarry begin cooking cacio e pepe, a favorite dish from their trip to Italy a few years ago. \u201cWe\u2019re literally just going to watch water boil for a while,\u201d McGarry says, filling a huge saucepan with water.McGarry peers into the bubbling pot, now filled with spaghetti. \u201cCan you taste it please?\u201d he asks Shipka. \u201cI have weird pasta anxiety and I\u2019m terrified of overcooking it.\u201d She forks out a strand and starts chewing before pronouncing it \u201cstill a little crunchy.\u201dWhile I grew up with Melissa Joan Hart, Shipka plays the streaming generation\u2019s Sabrina\u2014a sixteen year old mortal witch, forced to decide between the real world and the magical. \u201cI tried to tap into that duality, sort of like being pulled in two directions,\u201d Shipka explains, stirring the pot. \u201cI feel like everyone can relate to that in some aspect of their lives.\u201dClearly, Kiernan Shipka  is an expert pasta twirler.\nPhoto by Laura MurrayMeanwhile, McGarry\u2019s anxiety reaches breaking point. \u201cWe just have to strain this right now,\u201d he says, laughing. Shipka reserves some water, McGarry strains the pasta, and they have it all back in a buttery saucepan before anyone knows what\u2019s happened. Clearly they\u2019ve done this before.Maybe it\u2019s all the steam, but Shipka seems to me like a stick of Glossier Haloscope in human form. (She grew up in California, after all.) But she assures me it\u2019s a different story after an intense 14-hour day on set. \u201cI was so stressed out last season that I was getting really random hives,\u201d she says, throwing handfuls of Grana Padano into the saucepan that McGarry\u2019s conscientiously stirring. \u201cAnd other times I\u2019d just cry for no reason because I was so sleep-deprived.\u201dSince then, Shipka\u2019s turned herself into some kind of elite power-napper. Her ability to sleep anywhere\u2014sans lavender oil, CBD, or eye masks\u2014is enviable, and it\u2019s how she gets through the killer days. Apart from some good shut-eye, she stress-busts with adaptogens, massages, and a quick jump on her rebounder (a kind of compact trampoline marketed to adults). \u201cIt shakes the whole trailer and everyone freaks out,\u201d she says. \u201cMeanwhile I\u2019m just in there having a very fun time.\u201d\u201cOkay, twirl the spaghetti around the tongs,\u201d McGarry interrupts. \u201cAnd then right when you think it's twirled enough, grab it really quickly and drop it in the bowl.\u201d A mess of creamy spaghetti slops all over the bench. \u201cIs this...rustic?\u201d Shipka asks. She grabs a pepper mill so large it makes her look like a stand-up paddle boarder and dusts the entire bowl.McGarry and Shipka sharing a bite.\nPhoto by Laura Murray\u201cI think cooking and acting are kind of analogous,\u201d Shipka says amid bites of cheesy pasta. (McGarry\u2019s back in the kitchen briefing his cooks for a full day of prep before they open for dinner at 6 p.m.) \u201cIn a lot of ways it's a different art form, but Flynn and I definitely share that same sort of commitment and perfectionism.\u201dSeason two of The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is set to air on April 5th, but Shipka\u2019s already focused on filming Season 3. She says she\u2019s proud to be in a role that she believes can be meaningful for young girls everywhere. \u201cThe show is filmed during such an influential time in Sabrina\u2019s life,\u201d Shipka says. \u201cShe\u2019s so strong-willed and kind, and I think that\u2019s really important for girls to see.\u201dWe wrap the interview in a hurry\u2014Shipka and her mom are off to have their auras read in Chinatown. But hopefully after that comes an ashwagandha latte and good, long nap.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishCelebritiesInterviewsRead MoreLifestyleHow PEN15\u2019s Anna Konkle Went from Waiting Tables at Prune to Wearing Fake Leg HairBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
