Stay home! Wash ya hands! Rewatch GoodFellas. Google \u201callergy symptoms.\u201d And make some frothy coffee.You don\u2019t have to bend my arm. (It\u2019d be the only exercise I\u2019ve gotten all day.) I love a novelty coffee beverage. They spark me with sugary, temporary joy. If you wake up in the morning, refresh the news app on your phone, and let out a guttural moan for all of mankind, that sort of temporary joy is in short supply. So take all you can get, my friends.Frothy coffee, officially known as dalgona coffee but with multiple cousins around the world, is big on TikTok, Instagram, and foodie blogs right now. For obvious reasons! It\u2019s ADORABLE. It looks like an emoji. Billowy, thick coffee fluff island floating on your weird \u201cmilk\u201d of choice. Normally\u2014haha, normal\u2014I drink black coffee because that makes me feel like a hardened cowboy ready to lasso some tumbleweeds. But in these abnormal times, I\u2019m looking for distraction anywhere I can find it. I wanted to try the trendy coffee.The recipe I used: Combine 1 Tbsp. instant coffee (Caf\u00e9 Bustelo if you know what\u2019s good for you), 1 Tbsp. sugar, and 1 Tbsp. boiling water in a cup or whatever. Froth it up with the $3 Ikea milk frother  you knew would come in handy one day for something other than spare batteries. Prepare ice and milk in a glass and pour the frothy stuff over top. Voil\u00e0!!!I\u2019m not sure the science here, but the instant coffee dissolves (regular coffee would be grainy/gross) and, with the help of the sugar, transforms into this near-solid, creamy blob, much denser than foamed milk. If I didn\u2019t have a frother, I\u2019d try shaking it in a mason jar or a handheld whisk, which is how photographer Emma Fishman made it. The froth itself is sooo sweet and while the separate layers remain long enough for you to take a pic, eventually the coffee mixes into the milk and the whole drink balances out.Caveat! Instead of diluting the instant coffee, you\u2019re getting a concentrated hit of it. It left me WIRED and BUZZIN\u2019. My toenails were tingling. I speed-clicked between 14 different tabs open on my computer, the indoor equivalent of lassoing tumbleweeds, accomplishing nothing. But what fleeting fun.  I can\u2019t promise anything permanent, but temporary joy? That I can handle.Explore Bon App\u00e9titTrendsI Gave InRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
