See our past recommendations here!What does it take to concoct the perfect cup of coffee at home? According to my husband, Perry, it\u2019s a high-end espresso machine. According to me, a French press. After years of debating we seemed destined to remain at loggerheads\u2014until we discovered the Pure Over.The Pure Over is a coffee maker that straddles the line between a pour-over in function and a French press in flavor. Made entirely of glass and as functional as it is beautiful, it requires no pods or filters and is composed of four pieces\u2014a mug, a dripper, a diffuser lid, and a coaster. Place the dripper on top of the mug, fill it with medium-ground coffee beans, and then place the diffuser lid on top of the dripper. As you slowly pour boiling water into the lid, its holes regulate the speed at which the water rains into the dripper chamber below, evenly saturating the coffee. The grounds themselves act as a filter, no paper needed. The setup yields the sort of cup that tastes as high-end as my husband likes and as accessible as I have time to make while pregnant with a toddler at home.The Pure Over is the brainchild of 32-year-old glass artist and java expert Etai Rahmil. After running out of paper filters while in his glass blowing shop in Portland, Oregon, he decided to create a novel brewing method that would forever eliminate the need for traditional filters\u2014which, he argues, also prevent natural oils from dripping into the cup. Rahmil works with borosilicate, a specific type of glass that is also used in the medical field and can withstand drastic temperature changes without breaking. \u201cThe glass is a natural heat insulator that will help keep the drink at optimal temperature for longer,\u201d he explains. Bonus points: It\u2019s easily cleanable and can even be thrown into the dishwasher.According to Rahmil, it takes 1.5 million trees to make the 275 billion coffee filters produced every year, and the average coffee drinker discards 25,000 filters at a cost of $6,500 in his or her lifetime. So not only does the Pure Over deliver a bold and convenient cup of coffee, it also makes me feel like I\u2019m doing my part for the planet\u2014and yes, my husband agrees.Pure Over Glass Coffee Kit$84 $75 at Pure OverExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish Loves ItRead MoreshoppingThese Globally Inspired Snack Boxes Let Me Travel Without, Well, TravelingBy Hilary CadiganRecipes you want to make.
