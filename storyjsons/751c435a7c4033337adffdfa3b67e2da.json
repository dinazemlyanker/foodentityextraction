Tossed in a sticky, spicy honey glaze, these are the perfect exemplar of that very specific and beloved texture: crispy-gone-soggy. This recipe is based on a similar dish that often appears in many Indian Chinese restaurants known as honey chili potatoes. Use crinkle-cut fries, waffle fries, tater tots, or even fries from your favorite take-out place if you\u2019d like. Just make sure to warm the fries through in the oven before tossing them in the sauce. If you want to retain some virtuousness, serve these with steamed white rice and steamed green vegetables such as broccoli, Chinese broccoli, or bok choy. \u2014Shilpa UskokovicAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.
