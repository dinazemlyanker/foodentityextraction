This time around: how to start a spice collection and put it to use.There isn\u2019t one right way to organize your spice cabinet/drawer/closet. But there are some non-negotiables for making a collection that works for\u2014not against\u2014you. Here's our list:1. Keep it far away from your oven.Heat causes spices to degrade faster. So if you\u2019re storing your collection above your stove or near a radiator, it\u2019s probably best to rearrange.2. Toss anything you can\u2019t remember using. You won\u2019t miss it.Even if your spices are in a cool, dark place, they\u2019re not improving with age. So if you\u2019re not sure where you bought that mustard powder or when you last used it, chances are it\u2019s no longer fragrant anyway.3. You don\u2019t need a million spices.Find the ones you love (check out some of these personal lists from test kitchen editors for some inspiration) and leave the others for the rest of us. If a recipe you\u2019re following calls for a small amount of a spice that you can\u2019t imagine ever using again, skip it.4. Optimize the space you\u2019ve got.If you have a pull-out drawer, label the tops so you can keep track of your inventory, or invest in an in-drawer insert so the spices can lay on their sides. If you\u2019re using a shelf, label the sides of the jars and buy a lazy Susan or tiered shelf for easiest access.5. Any organization method is better than no organization method.Some people like to arrange alphabetically, while others categorize by type (peppers, warm baking spices, aromatics, herbs, all the rest), area of the world, or frequency of use. Think about what makes the most sense for you, then make a system and strongly encourage anyone else sharing the drawer to put the jars back in their intended places, lest they lose their privileges.6. Buy a set of standard jars.Make sure they\u2019re small to encourage turnover (we like 2-ouncers) and that you can fit a teaspoon inside. Glass is the material of choice\u2014it does that best job of protecting your precious goods.Buy it: 24-pack of 2-ounce glass jars, $29 on AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
