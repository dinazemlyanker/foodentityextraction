Use it up.\u00a0By Sarah JampelMarch 24, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Yekaterina BoytsovaFacebookTwitterEmailWe're spending more time in our homes than ever before. In \"There's No Better Time To...\" we'll share the little projects we're finally getting around to. Today: Reach into the depths of your pantry and use the oldest thing first.There\u2019s plenty of perfectly edible food squirreled away in the far reaches of my cabinets that has, for whatever reason, gone by the wayside. A couple months ago, I would have griped about it\u2014I didn\u2019t have time to figure out what to do with the bottle of kecap manis, I couldn\u2019t possibly tap into the precious reserve of pearl sugar I\u2019d been guarding with my life\u2014but now, I\u2019ve run out of excuses. And that\u2019s kinda sorta empowering! That time I'd normally spend commuting? Now I can use it to soak rice or read up on (slash bug Andy Baraghani about) dried chiles or figure out how I ended up with three pounds of flattened rice, a.k.a. poha, in the first place. In some strange way, it\u2019s lighting my creative spark (is that corny?) to work with what I\u2019ve got rather than reach for my usual crutches.Why now? Well, over these past few weeks, there\u2019s been plenty of information about what to acquire in preparation for hunkering down and staying in. I\u2019ve purchased a couple pounds of pasta and a few cans of tomatoes, along with plenty of rice, nuts, beans, and practically indestructible vegetables. That kabocha will be with me for the long haul.But I\u2019m trying to listen to the experts (hi mom) who tell me to set that stash aside for safe-keeping. Instead of tapping into the new provisions, I\u2019m abiding as best I can by the common restaurant mantra: first in, first out. This dictates that the items I first added to my pantry (the bags and jars that moved with me to Brooklyn, ahem, nearly five years ago) should also be the first I use.Remember all that stuff you added to your pantry back in 2018? Time to use it!\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigI should say that pantry items don\u2019t live forever. So before I make a plan, I browse the internet to get a sense of the general lifespan of the food, and then I examine it to make sure it won\u2019t harm me or my partner. Since that would be bad.So this week, my goal is to tackle the \u201cseaweed section,\u201d the bag of wakame, hijiki, arame, and kombu that has escaped my grasp for years. I have multiple bags of unopened bonito, too, so I\u2019m thinking of making dashi. I\u2019ll refrigerate some of it for later in the week and use a portion to make a simple soup with those three ounces of soba noodles leftover from a recipe that only called for five, rehydrated seaweed, and the napa cabbage bobbing around the refrigerator.If you can\u2019t remember what\u2019s even in your pantry, it\u2019s probably a good idea to take it all out! Unpack everything onto sheet trays (when I do this, I stand on the counter and my partner spots me, like I\u2019m an acrobat or something!) and then reorganize and prioritize. You might even want to break out the masking tape! The last time I did this, I wrote an inventory of each cabinet and stuck it on the inside door. (Dork alert.) But now, whenever I reach for the sugar I\u2019m reminded that yes, we do have dried fenugreek leaves and glutinous rice and two kinds of date syrup and maybe I can cook something I\u2019d never ordinarily make!Let\u2019s say you\u2019re staring down a bottle of Ikea ketchup and you\u2019re stumped. Send me a message on Twitter or Instagram and I\u2019ll try to help! Really, I will. Okonomiyaki sauce? Ketchup-glazed lentil loaf? Sweet and sour cauliflower? As Hillel the Elder once said, \u201cIf not now, when?\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titCoronavirusThere's No Better Time BasicallyRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
