Some argue it should be made with cornmeal, no sugar or wheat allowed. Others think cornbread is incomplete without a sweet touch and the lighter, cakier texture that wheat flour brings. This recipe combines equal parts medium-grind yellow cornmeal and flour, just a hint of sugar, and buttermilk for subtle tangy flavor and lighter texture.It\u2019s perfect next to a big bowl of bean chili or used in Cornbread Stuffing With Sausage and Corn Nuts. (And in case you need a reminder, you never need to wait for Thanksgiving to serve stuffing.) If you enjoy sweet cornbread for breakfast, feel free to double the sugar in this recipe, slather a thick slice with butter and honey, and devour before anyone else in the house wakes up.Editor\u2019s note: This recipe was originally published October 16, 2018.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I baked it for the minimum and it came out perfect. Usually I like sweet cornbread, but this was for stuffing and I didn\u2019t think sweet was the way to go.  Pepper and buttermilk gave a very nice note. David FSeattle11/20/2021This is what we call 'Yankee cornbread.'  No self-respecting Southerner would put sugar in cornbread.\nJSB Asheville, NC11/19/2021Great recipe. However, its hard to choke down thinking of beans in chili!BirdieSan Antonio, Tx11/18/2021If you do 25 minutes you have glop. 40 minimum.John rNJ11/15/2021I halved the recipe and used about 1/4 cup maple syrup instead of the sugar. But my real secret to great cornbread is a handful of grated cheese. Cheddar is OK but the best is pepper jack. Oh, also I baked it in a cast iron skillet that I let get hot in the oven, then oiled and quickly poured in the batter.Granny AvonLA5/10/2021This recipe doesn\u2019t have much flavor. I might up the sugar and salt next time. AnonymousChicago, IL 1/20/2021I've made this twice now\u2014once for eating and once for BA's cornbread and salami dressing\u2014and I think it's pretty good, though I expect to use it only for cornbread dressing moving forward. I followed the recipe closely in my first attempt, with the exception of substituting honey for sugar and doubling the amount of the honey per one of the other commenter's suggestions. I also used preground pepper. In my second attempt, I once again substituted honey for sugar and also substituted whole wheat flour for all-purpose flour, corn grits for some of the cornmeal, and DIY oat milk buttermilk for buttermilk. Both times, the cornbread was moist, easy to get out of the pan, and maintained its integrity when cut, which was great for preparing stuffing cubes. Echoing other commenters, I found the flavor a little lackluster, although I enjoyed my second batch\u2014which had the amount of sugar called for in the recipe and included freshly ground pepper\u2014much more. The fresh pepper noticeably improved the flavor. If anyone else prefers whole wheat flour and/or has more corn grits on hand than cornmeal, those substitutes didn't considerably change the outcome. (If anything, the grits made it a bit heartier, which was nice for dressing!) If you're looking for a sweeter cornbread for snacking, another recipe might be a better choice; however, if you're making cornbread croutons or stuffing, this is the ticket. GinnyPittsburgh, PA11/22/2020I only had coarse-grind cornmeal, so that's what I used, but it still turned out great! Per the review below, I did double the sugar and found the taste to be perfectly sweet, so I'm glad I did it. I did find that the sides and bottom browned more quickly than the top, but the taste and texture wasn't compromised so I don't really mind!AnonymousIN10/30/2020Doubled the sugar because I wanted it to be a bit sweet and loved it. Holds together very well. Just sweet enough. Definitely will make again!danielle324TN9/12/2020I cut the recipe in half and made in an 8x8 pan, came out perfect.  I think the deliciousness may be partly related to using Five Acre buttermilk ... the good stuff.  It was great with chili for dinner and then toasted with butter and jam for breakfast the next day. I will file this as my go-to cornbread.AnonymousNYC1/16/2020P.S.  I also use creamed corn and whole corn in my recipe.AnonymousDavie,Fl1/10/2020I cannot rate this properly  because I haven't made this recipe yet but I do add jalapenos to the recipe I use now.  I think I will make this one because I LOVE buttermilk.  Patty CakeDavie,Fl1/10/2020I made this gluten-free by subbing in one-for-one all-purpose gluten-free flour. It worked great. I used it for stuffing, but if I was going to serve it by itself, I would add a little more salt next time.AnonymousMassachusetts11/29/2019I made this today. If there was a competition between the five best stuffings eve made, this is Usain Bolt, and the other four are a six-year old kid, a 90- year old grandma with a walker, a guy with crutches, and a sloth. So good! Thanks to Rick and Chris for their work on this. Delicious.
