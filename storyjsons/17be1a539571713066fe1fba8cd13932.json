In fact, it is probably one of my Top 10 Favorite Foods of All Time. I know! It\u2019s a salad! But it\u2019s a salad with a creamy, anchovy-packed, cheesy dressing and golden-brown bread nuggets (also known as croutons). I am not a professional, so I can tell you that when I \u201ctaste\u201d my Caesar dressing, I do it by inserting a big ol\u2019 spoonful of it into my mouth. Followed by a second one, just to be sure it\u2019s right.But do you know who is a professional? Chris Morocco. That is why I jumped at the opportunity to make his Broccoli Caesar, which is every bit as delectable as the original, and an even a better match for that dinner party you\u2019re hosting this fall weekend.Chris used both raw broccoli (more on that in a minute) and Napa cabbage as the base instead of Romaine, two heartier, sturdier greens that stand up well, long after dressing. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s only going to improve with age,\u201d Chris says. So prep it ahead of time and let the flavors\u2014spicy garlic, briny anchovy, bracing lemon zest\u2014really soak in.Peel. Those. Stems.\nPhoto by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen Kaminski\u201cThere\u2019s something pleasant about keeping a salad raw, even when it\u2019s a root vegetable like carrots, or the cruciferous greens in this recipe,\u201d Chris says. \u201cIt\u2019s a good counterpoint to the richer and more decadent food you\u2019re generally eating in the fall.\u201d The key, though, is to make sure the texture is, indeed, pleasant\u2014not the squeaky kind of raw that is difficult to chew.You do this by making sure the broccoli florets are not so small that they would turn to fluff and disappear into the dressing, but not so big that they\u2019d be confused for crudit\u00b4\u00e9s. When it came to the stems, I made sure to peel them before slicing, just like the recipe instructs. No cheating here. Those stems have a bad rap, but once the firmer outside is gone, I find them to be the most tender and flavorful part of the whole veg.Full disclosure: I did not make this recipe for a dinner party, though I plan to soon. I made it for myself. And though it doesn\u2019t call for it, I also added golden-brown bread nuggets in there, because it was dinner, and I was hungry. Like I said, I\u2019m not a professional, but I don\u2019t think Chris would complain.Get the recipe:Broccoli CaesarYou've never met a better, brighter riff on the classic Caesar than this raw broccoli twist.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBroccoliSaladFallWeeknightRead MorecookingHow to Make a Thanksgiving Salad That Everyone Will Actually EatBy Sarah JampelRecipes you want to make.
