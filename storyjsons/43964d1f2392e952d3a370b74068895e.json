On the couch.By Alex DelanyOctober 7, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Emma FishmanFacebookTwitterEmailTwo weeks ago I realized I hadn\u2019t cooked dinner at home in ten days. For someone that works at a recipe-focused food brand, that\u2019s kind of inexcusable. So I canceled plans that evening, left work at an appropriate time, and stopped at the grocery store on the way home. I made kielbasa fried rice and listened to a couple records as I did it. I sat down with a plate of simple, cheap, incredibly satisfying dinner and proceeded to watch Ocean\u2019s 12 and Ocean\u2019s 13 on Netflix. Yes, I watched them both. In one sitting. Yes, I started with 12. And yes, THEY HOLD UP. Clooney, Pitt, Damon, Cheadle, Roberts, Garcia, Zeta-Jones, Cassel, Gould, Pacino, all on the same screen, spitting hilarious, non-stop banter? Are you kidding me? Why hadn\u2019t I watched those movies in forever? They're fun!Needless to say, I had a fantastic evening alone, sitting on my couch, eating fried rice as the largest stars of the mid-2000s pulled off flashy, elaborate heists. It was a recharge night\u2014and it was the best night I had all month. That\u2019s Rent Week right there: understated yet supremely enjoyable, just like the kielbasa fried rice I chose for this month\u2019s recipe. So cancel your weeknight plans, throw on this Stuff I\u2019ve Been Listening To playlist I made for you (completely free of charge), and get ready to eat some fried rice in your comfiest pair of gym shorts.We\u2019ll start with our rice. If you\u2019ve read about fried rice on Basically before, you remember that we like to use day-old rice. If you\u2019re going for crispy fried rice, this is key, since there\u2019s less moisture in the rice, meaning that it will dry out quickly. But we\u2019re not going for crispy rice. We want the fluffy stuff\u2014there\u2019s already enough texture going on with the kielbasa. So first up, steam 1 cup of rice.Kielbasa fried rice? You love to see it.\nWhile your rice is steaming, prep your other ingredients:Take 1 link of Polish style kielbasa (We\u2019re talking about 14\u201316 oz. of sausage) and slice it into coins that measure about \u00bc\u201d thick.Thinly slice 8 scallions on a bias, so the cross section is a little bit wider than it would be if you sliced them directly across the trunk. And thinly slice 2 cloves of garlic.Toast some sesame seeds to garnish our rice later on. If you\u2019re thinking, Hmmmmmm toasted sesame seeds? I feel like he uses toasted sesame seeds in a lot of his recipes, then you are correct. They're not only my favorite topping ever created, but you probably have some in your pantry and they take all of 5 minutes to toast in a dry nonstick skillet over medium heat. Just make sure you give the pan a shake every once in a while. Burnt sesame seeds aren\u2019t so tasty.Next, start cooking:Heat a couple glugs of neutral oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.Dump the sliced kielbasa in the pan and let cook, undisturbed, for about 3 minutes, until the underside takes on a deep brown color.Add the sliced scallions and garlic to the pan and stir so that most of the kielbasa flips to the other side. Sprinkle with kosher salt and continue to cook for another couple minutes, until the scallions begin to soften.In goes the rice:Dump your steamed rice into the skillet with one more glug of neutral oil.Immediately add a couple pinches of salt, a splash of soy sauce, and a couple pinches of white sugar. I know, the sugar sounds a little odd, but next time you order fried rice at a restaurant, pay attention to the sweetness. Fried rice is sweet. That\u2019s the truth. It also balances the saltiness of the kielbasa and helps with caramelization.Stir the contents of the pan so the scallions, garlic, and kielbasa are evenly distributed.Clooney might like this rice. Maybe not. But also...maybe yes.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanNow it\u2019s time for the egg river. Yeah, a geological feature made out of eggs. Sounds fun, right?Quickly whisk 3 large eggs and a pinch of salt in a small bowl.Push the contents of your skillet to either side so that a strip of exposed pan runs down the middle. There shouldn't be any rice in this section.Pour the whisked eggs into the exposed section of the skillet. Bam. That\u2019s the egg river. Let the eggs sit undisturbed for 1\u20132 minutes, then give them a quick scramble, scraping along the bottom of the skillet. Once the eggs have cooked through, give the whole skillet a stir, distributing the eggs throughout the rice.You're finished! Throw a couple big scoops into a shallow bowl, top it with sesame seeds and a squeeze of lime juice. Grab a fork. Or a spoon, if that\u2019s your thing. (I won\u2019t judge you either way.) Sit down on your couch. And watch a movie you\u2019ve already seen before. You don\u2019t need to do anything at all tonight. You already made fried rice. That\u2019s plenty.Rice not your thing? Try some noodles instead.These Cold, Pesto-y Rice Noodles Are Incredibly ChillHot noodles? During Rent Week? In this heat?
