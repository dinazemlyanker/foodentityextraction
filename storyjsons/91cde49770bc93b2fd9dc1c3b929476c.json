I agree with the comment below about the temperature, I cooked it until 145 and it was still perfectly juicy. We didn't have any peach preserves on hand so I threw a couple of peaches in a pot with some brown sugar and cooked it down to a preserve-like consistency and it worked perfectly on the meat. Will definitely make this again. Asparagus is good with the mustard peach sauce, too. Chicago6/29/2020Umm, 130\u00b0 for an internal temp on pork is 15\u00b0 lower than the latest amendment lowering the safe temp for pork (now down to 145\u00b0) so I\u2019m not sure what y\u2019all are cooking, but I don\u2019t think it should be pork loin at that temp! \nNevertheless, I made this recipe last night and cooked to a safe temp on the grill and it was still juicy and tasty, tho I used orange and elderflower marmalade since that\u2019s what I had on hand and it was great. Also subbed mango for peaches for the sauce, delicious! \n\nThe 3 star review is for the safe temp error - y\u2019all ought to know better! timespaceonePittsburgh7/30/2019Simple and easy to make. It is very delicious. I made mine with a potatoes and onions foil packet cooked on the grill.bergstrom.jeffreyRichmond Hill, GA5/28/2018Here we go again with another fantastic Bon Appetit recipe.
