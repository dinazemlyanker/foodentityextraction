Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,I took my semi-annual break from this newsletter last week, for no other reason than that I was totally burned out. Instead of writing, I took a longer-than-usual walk with my dog and went on a YouTube quest to learn how to make Sichuan Boiled Fish. It was very nice, but if you think this letter is gonna be about how restored and revived I feel now, well, maybe go read about the best ways to use lentils instead.I don\u2019t feel ~great~ still, because who does? At the very least, I feel grateful that I\u2019m healthy and it\u2019s summer and, by some measures, things seem to be graaadually moving in the right direction. For now. Maybe.I think that\u2019s what\u2019s so hard for me still: The not knowing from week to week or even day to day what the world\u2014mine and ours and everyone else\u2019s\u2014is going to look like. It\u2019s not like I go around thinking, \u201cDamn, I\u2019m so upset about all this uncertainty.\u201d Instead I find myself organizing my fridge even more obsessively than usual. And throwing a fit when my oven\u2019s temperature indicator somehow changes to Celsius and my braised oxtails burns to bits. (In case you\u2019re wondering, 250\u00b0 C is almost 500\u00b0 F, and nothing in this world can survive seven hours in that kind of heat.) And lying on a couch last weekend and realizing, oh, I\u2019m crying. Haven\u2019t done that in a while.Another change: I still read too much Twitter and listen to too many news podcasts, but I\u2019ve noticed some apathy setting in. Which is no surprise, I guess. When we bombard our brains with information, most of it negative, at a certain point it just shuts off. There\u2019s a limit to how much bad we can absorb.I don\u2019t want to feel apathetic right now. There\u2019s too much work to be done, too much need. So I\u2019m trying, counterintuitively, to let go a little so that I can care more. Instead of devouring news, I\u2019ve been listening to music again, like this new album by my friend Todd that is good for walking. I\u2019ve been walking a lot! I\u2019ve been listening to podcasts that are not about the pandemic, like the latest season of Bodies, which is perhaps my favorite podcast of them all. I finally finished Three Women (so did Basically editor Sarah Jampel, and we HAVE to talk). I\u2019ve been finding love.I\u2019ve still been organizing, but less obsessively. I\u2019m not quite ready for a Chaey-level pantry spreadsheet, but she did inspire me to tack a page to my fridge where I write down fresh items to use ASAP (mozzarella, so many herbs) and what\u2019s overstaying its welcome in my freezer (wonton wrappers, frozen edamame) and pantry (dried chickpeas, canned tuna). Sometimes I scrawl out dinner ideas: \u201cpanang curry with chicken?\u201d is there now. But that\u2019s as far as I go with it. There\u2019s a lot of blank space on that page, and I\u2019m trying to be comfortable with that.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish editorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletteressayRead MoreLifestyleIf You Care About WellnessBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
