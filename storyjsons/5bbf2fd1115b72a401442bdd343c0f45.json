If you\u2019ve ever ordered a negroni, an Aperol spritz, or an Americano (the cocktail not the coffee), then you\u2019ve definitely tasted the bitter, rosy-hued Italian pre-dinner liqueur.Chances are also high that whatever you\u2019ve been drinking\u2014whether Campari, Aperol, Cappelletti, or Luxardo Bitter\u2014probably came from Italy, where hyper-regional aperitivi are part of the culture. Or at least, that would have been the default up until a few years ago, when the United States decided to get into the game.We happen to be living in a new era of American aperitivo. Right now, small producers in cities like San Francisco, Washington D.C., and Denver are turning out their own delicious expressions of the appetite-inducing liqueur, bringing a range of new flavors and formulas to what Italy\u2019s Campari-adjacent classics (typically reliant on dried bitter orange) already offer. Each label macerates a different blend of spices, barks, herbs, fruits, flowers, roots, and leaves from near and far to create unique flavor profiles, but my favorite of the bunch is Forthave Red, made in a cozy, single-room facility Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn.This negroni gets even better with my No. 1 Campari substitute.\nPHOTO BY CHELSIE CRAIGWhat makes it my number one? In short: balance. A lot of aperitivi lean on bold, aggressive flavors to separate themselves from the rest of the pack. But in Forthave Red, no ingredient shouts over the others. The notes of bright orange and floral honey and gentle chamomile and bitter rhubarb are all having a civilized, lovely conversation with one another, packing a bright bitterness and warm spice that you can taste in each sip.Speaking of sipping, while I\u2019ll use Red the same way I use the Italian stuff\u2014subbing it in for Aperol for a more nuanced spritz or as a Campari substitute in a Boulevardier for a tad more vegetal bitterness\u2014my favorite way to drink it is alone in a rocks glass, with a single ice cube. If that\u2019s not a testament to how balanced and layered and downright delicious Red is, then I don\u2019t know what is.Right now, you can find Red in cities like New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Washington D.C. And if you don\u2019t happen to live in those areas, I\u2019d say get your hands on whatever you can find in the city you\u2019re in. You know, like the Italians do.Explore Bon App\u00e9titGlass Half FullRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
