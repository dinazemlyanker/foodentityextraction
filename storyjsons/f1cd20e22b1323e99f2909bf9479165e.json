The bright, just-sweet-enough dressing tempers the bitterness of the greens and the richness of the salami for a balanced dish you just might not want to share.Ingredients4 servings1Tbsp. unsalted butter7Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided114.5-oz. can chickpeas, rinsed2small garlic cloves, dividedKosher salt3Tbsp. red wine vinegar1\u00bdtsp. honey1tsp.

Also, saut\u00e9ed chick peas are a great  who knew?! Gianna NBrooklyn NY12/8/2020Turned out great. I added fennel greens and some fried basil but otherwise left it as is. The provolone was a really good element. AnonymousBrooklyn4/26/2020I loved the idea of this recipe, but in practice I found it a little too bitter. Next time I make it (and I will) I'll add some iceberg lettuce in place of half of the radicchio. We really loved the dressing!AnonymousMontr\u00e9al2/26/2020I veganized it by replacing cheese and salami with a bunch of chopped up sundried tomatos. Also added some of the tomato-oil to the dressing. It works really well together!AnonymousGermany2/26/2020I ended up eating three helpings I loved it so much.  Salami and the chickpea mix was perfection.  I will definitely add more salami next time.  I also used a soft italian monteo cheese as I couldn't find the provolone.  Will be making this again and again.AnonymousLong Beach, CA1/28/2020I had such high hopes for this recipe but it was a dud. I followed the recipe to a T. Maybe my radicchio was too large but the meal was extremely bitter and i wound up throwing it away :-( AnonymousColumbus, OH1/24/2020Whiiped it up in a jiffy to east some of my favorite foods! Added more meat took out dijon and used regular mustardHome Cook ChefUSA1/23/2020This was great! I loved the crisped chickpeas. I added some sliced black olives and 2 chopped Persian cucumbers, and I used a turkey salami from Trader Joe\u2019s. My fianc\u00e9 actually applauded after we finished eating, he liked it so much.AnonymousPortland, OR1/21/2020Made this tonight and it was fantastic. Followed the recipe exactly. Wasn\u2019t sure if I should chop the garlic with the chickpeas or leave it whole (I left it whole). I\u2019ll make this again!AnonymousBrooklyn, Ny1/17/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladItalian AmericanAmericanRadicchioChicoryLeafy GreensVegetableEndiveSalamiCured MeatMeatChickpeaBeanWinterQuickEasyWeeknight MealsMainSideGluten-FreeLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
