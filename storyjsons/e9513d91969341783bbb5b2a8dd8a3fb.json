A rechargeable lighter, in this case.After a road trip gone right last summer, I\u2019ve spent most of the year far from my Silicon Valley home, reveling in the wilds of Montana. Big Sky Country is transformationally beautiful. Its sweeping fields, cathedral-like mountain ranges, and babbling cricks are clean, clear, and threatened only by an influx of out-of-staters moving here, like me. Fueled by natural awe (and an admitted tinge of tourist guilt), I\u2019ve been eager to live here as sustainably as possible. When I learned that 350 million disposable butane lighters\u2014like the ones I was using to ignite my fireplace on frosty mornings\u2014are thrown away in the United States every year, I was keen to do something about it. Enter scene: this ultra-sustainable and tech-savvy USB Rechargeable Lighter from the USB Lighter Company.Photography by Isa Zapata. \u00a0Prop Styling by Paige HicksUSB Rechargeable Lighter$32 at Food52$30 at The GrommetThe svelte lighter arrived in zero-waste packaging that\u2019s been approved by the nonprofit Forest Stewardship Council (\u201cForests for All Forever,\u201d baby). It\u2019s now become a Why hadn\u2019t I thought of this? home addition. I use it to fire the char-grill to crackle up home-raised rib eyes and to light my Boy Smells Cowboy Kush candle for journaling and meditation sessions. And unlike the case with matches, I can execute the Operation-like precision tasks required to light a dead pilot light or tea candles without ending up with torched fingertips, sooty smoke streaks, or a visit from the fire department.The sustainable part is right in its name\u2014the USB Rechargeable Lighter plugs into a computer or any other electrical outlet. It\u2019s also butane-free and gas appliance-safe. It holds a whopping 300 uses per charge, leveraging tesla coil technology (a sweet reminder of the motherland), and mine has been going strong since its last charge three months ago. Plus, it comes in cherry reds, sunny yellows, metallics, and gem tones. I\u2019ll need my rose-gold one to spark joy as the winter cold hits.And it\u2019s so, so easy to use. Although I do not have a firm grasp on the physics of combustion, I can tell you that the lighter\u2019s two prongs conduct a neon arc of electricity that bursts into fire. After lighting what I need to (ideally, this camping-friendly Snow Peak GigaPower Torch for home-made wagyu nigiri), I can glide the prongs safely back into the lighter\u2019s neck for storage, which automatically disables the ignition button. Smart.Using this sustainable lighter is a very small ritual, but it feels like an appropriate way to thank the breathtaking state of Montana\u2014the place that has ignited so elegantly my love for the great outdoors.
