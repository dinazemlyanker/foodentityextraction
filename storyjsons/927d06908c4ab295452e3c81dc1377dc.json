Fifteen years a chef, with a passion for black culture. I\u2019m alright with that.\u201dBy Hilary CadiganMay 22, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Eric VitaleFacebookTwitterEmail\u201cMy ancestors were slaves. Like our grits, they ate fufu, like our air-dried meats they made biltong, and, as we do, they used salt and vinegar as a means of preservation,\u201d writes Todd Richards in his new autobiographical cookbook, Soul. \u201cThe flavors used in Soul cooking remain an expression of where we came from. Equally important, how we cook today defines where we want to go.\u201dBorn in Chicago and based in Atlanta, with roots tracing back to West Africa, Richards has dedicated much of his life to bucking the stereotypes that often surround black chefs. The two-time James Beard nominee recalls early in his career when he walked into a high-end kitchen for an interview and the white chef asked him, \u201cWhat are you going to do, make fried chicken and mac and cheese?\u201d And the thing is, yeah, Richards makes some of the best damn fried chicken and mac and cheese you\u2019ll ever taste. But that\u2019s not the end of his story. Not even close.Richards\u2019 career has taken him from Kroger\u2019s meat counter to the Ritz-Carlton, the Four Seasons, Iron Chef and beyond. Today, the self-taught chef is culinary director for Atlanta\u2019s award-winning airport eatery One Flew South along with rapper Ludacris\u2019 restaurant, Chicken+Beer. In 2016 he opened an upscale hot chicken stall in Atlanta called Richards\u2019 Southern Fried. In 2017 he started a pop-up dinner series with chef Guy Wong and mixologists Krista and Jerry Slater. This year, he released his first book.All this may seem a difficult balancing act, but Richards doesn\u2019t flinch. \u201cQuite honestly, I don\u2019t know what people expect from me anymore,\u201d he says. \u201cFifteen years a chef, with a passion for black culture. I\u2019m alright with that.\u201dIn Soul, which drops today, Richards presents 150 recipes illustrating the diversity of African American cuisine, interspersed with history lessons and influential anecdotes from his past. Like how watermelon went from \u201csymbol of freedom for emancipated slaves\u201d to \u201cenduring racist trope\u201d\u2014and how Richards uses it anyway, taking back the stereotype and giving it new power. Like the way his parents used to mix collard greens with leftover fried rice from a nearby Chinese restaurant, because no culture is a vacuum.  \u201cI often wonder why food gets categorized in such sweeping terms,\u201d he writes. \u201cLimit the labels. You\u2019ll liberate yourself in the kitchen, grow as a cook, and your taste buds will have better dining experiences.\u201dThe dishes in the book, gorgeously photographed and loosely divided by ingredient, range from hot water cornbread to grilled sea urchin, peach salad to lamb meatball skewers with fig yogurt sauce. It may sound like a chaotic blend, but Richards makes it personal, and thereby makes it work.\u201cBlack chefs are often limited by notions of soul food,\u201d he says, \u201cbut you can use it as a gateway.\u201d There\u2019s power in claiming a cuisine, in insisting on its value. Richards points out that while soul food can take a long time to cook (even a simple pot of collards sits on the stove for hours), diners expect to pay very little for it. \u201cFrom an economic standpoint, how can you have upward movement in society if you\u2019re relegated to taking on the most labor and charging the absolute least?\u201dTodd Richards (center) as a child in Chicago\nCourtesy of Todd RichardsWhile a sense of cultural justice runs deep through Soul, so does the joy Richards takes in cooking and sharing his recipes. His shrimp hot chicken-style, which he serves over homemade grits croutons, is as playful as it is tasty, the coastal South reimagined.\u201cI wanted to progress the idea of shrimp and grits, but still make it familiar enough where a person could see the origin of the dish,\u201d he says. Richards includes the shrimp shells and heads in his spicy, creamy sauce to maximize their shrimpy goodness, and eschews the exterior breading one might expect given the \u201chot chicken\u201d moniker. \u201cIf you coat it and fry it, the essence of shrimp gets lost in the batter.\u201dAs for the grits croutons? \u201cLeftover grits solidify in the pot as they cool and usually get discarded as a round sphere of misfortune,\u201d Richards writes in the recipe\u2019s headnote. \u201cReheating isn\u2019t ideal. Adding water creates a soggy, flavorless mess. Instead, cut cold grits into squares, fry them, and enjoy.\u201dInherent in everything Richards cooks is respect for the food itself, and for the hands that made it, century after century. \u201cThrowing away grits is sacrilegious,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, how could you even think about throwing away something that took 40 minutes to cook?\u201dRichards doesn\u2019t consider his book a political statement. To him, it\u2019s just an honest story about family, about history, about hard work. \u201cThis book isn\u2019t going to defeat Trump,\u201d he says. \u201cI think he\u2019ll do that to himself. But it is a way to inspire the next generation of cooks. My hope is that they do far better than what I\u2019ve been able to achieve.\u201dBuy it: Todd Richards' new cookbook, Soul, is $30 on AmazonGet the recipe:Shrimp Hot Chicken-Style with Grits CroutonsA classic Southern dish of shrimp and grits made hot chicken-style by chef Todd Richards.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCookbooksAtlantaSoul FoodRecipes you want to make.
