It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.I\u2019ve written before about the feelings of dread and despair that accompany the fall season, and I realize that my perspective may be offensive to the leaf-peepers and sweater-weatherers. I don\u2019t love death and decay, is that so wrong? Seriously. Trying to talk a summer-lovin\u2019, peak Leo person into loving fall is a fool\u2019s errand, so save it. But there are a few techniques I employ when darkness descends on the upper 48, and one of them is soup.Yeah: Soup. You know the saying\u2014soup is good food. It is! It\u2019s also Sunday stuff, which is my favorite day to get a pot of something going early in the day so that you can smell what you\u2019re having for dinner for many hours leading up to it.I make a version of my mom\u2019s pasta e fagioli almost every weekend, as she did when I was growing up. But there\u2019s a never-ending variation on beans, greens, and noodles (or rice) that you can turn to. I love lentils and sausage, or navy beans and escarole, or gigante beans and mushrooms.Want this letter before it hits the website?

Black bean? Check. Split pea? Check. Or maybe you just want to fast-track a batch of homemade stock that you can use in your soup of choice? Chicken stock, vegetable stock\u2014we got you!There are a few keys to any good soup. One is taking your time sweating out the vegetables that go into the base. Whether it\u2019s a bonafide sofrito or just a basic mirepoix, cooking those ingredients until they\u2019re very tender is key to coaxing out maximum flavor in the finished recipe. If you don\u2019t have good stock, use water, but make sure you season every step of the way. If you\u2019re a vegetarian and a soup calls for bacon, pancetta, a ham hock, or another meat as part of the base, feel free to omit it, but add back in a few tablespoons of olive oil to make up for the richness and fat that the porky product would have delivered. Last thing\u2014and this is key\u2014put out thick slices of lightly toasted bread, naan, pita, or a stack of warm tortillas. The tableside dunk is very necessary.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterSoupFallWinterRead MorecookingWhen You're Cooking Dried Beans, You're Already Halfway to SoupBy Sarah JampelcookingFor Dinner That Comes Together in No Time, Make Red Bean Soup with Taco FixinsBy Deb PerelmancookingThe 4-Ingredient Rice Porridge I Make When I'm Too Sick to CookBy Carey PoliscookingThe Most Opinionated Editors Came Together to Make BA\u2019s Best Matzo Ball SoupBy Emily SchultzRecipes you want to make.
