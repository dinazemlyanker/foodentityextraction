Here, he talks with David Walters about aging, craft services, and the St. Louis staple food that makes him nostalgic.Are you a healthyish eater?Jon Hamm: I think I am. You know, it sounds sort of crappy to say it, but most of the food that we are presented with has been processed to within an inch of its life, so it's not exactly the most healthy thing you can eat. So I try to eat as fresh as I can, and try to stay away from as much of the cheap stuff as I can, too. I'm not above eating a packet of potato chips or something every now and again, but I do try to make those occasions more of a stand-alone rather than habitual.Is there any secret to eating well when you\u2019re on location?JH: I try to eat as healthfully as I can. There are always options that are snacky, but mostly it\u2019s about self-control. Most of shooting is really just waiting around, unless you\u2019re working on an action film where you\u2019ve got to train. So you don\u2019t really need that much energy; the crew is the one that needs the energy. Don\u2019t eat like an idiot\u2014I think that\u2019s a good rule of thumb.Is there anything like juicing that worked for you? Or is it really just healthy moderation across the board?JH: You know, for me, it\u2019s really just about moderation. I like a nice juice. I like fresh fruit and vegetables. Those are the things that I kind of gravitate toward, just from a lifestyle standpoint, so the fact that they also happen to be healthy is great.Do you have a go-to breakfast?JH: That Icelandic yogurt Siggi\u2019s is really good and not too sour. I usually mix in some raspberries or blueberries and a little granola. And, if I have a little more time, I'll make bacon and eggs. I like to have something in my stomach in the morning because just coffee can be a little bit daunting.Let\u2019s briefly hit on the \u201cish\u201d part of healthyish. Do you have any food vices?JH: Well I do like a doughnut.  I used to be able to house half a dozen doughnuts and not think about it because I was a three-sport varsity athlete and a kid. But I think part of becoming over 40 is realizing that you can\u2019t eat the way you used to eat if you want to be healthy at all. Your metabolism slows significantly and your body just changes. You know, you get out what you put in. And if you don\u2019t watch it, you\u2019re gonna be on the wrong side of that equation. But I do like a donut every now and then\u2014I\u2019m treating myself.I want to make a final, very labored connection to Nostalgia. Is there any food that makes you nostalgic?JH: This is gonna kind of go counter to everything that I've just said, but St. Louis has a very specific culinary tradition\u2014we have this great stuff called frozen custard. There's a place called Ted Drewes in St. Louis, and it\u2019s basically an ice cream store that\u2019s been around for the better part of a hundred years. But it\u2019s frozen custard, so there are even more calories in it. Danny Meyer included frozen custard in his Shake Shack menu, and Danny\u2019s a St. Louis guy. We went to high school together. That\u2019s probably the food that gets me going the most.This mousse is a little healthier than frozen custard:Coconut-Chocolate MousseChoose a chocolate that does not exceed 64% cacao for a mousse with the smoothest texture. If you want the mousse to be fully non-dairy, look for a vegan chocolate bar, though the flavor may differ slightly.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishCelebritiesBreakfastYogurtInterviewsRead MorecultureHow Samira Wiley Practices Self-Care After a Long Day on the 'Handmaid's Tale'By Alyse WhitneyRecipes you want to make.
