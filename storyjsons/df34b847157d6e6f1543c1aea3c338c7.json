I simplify it by using farro, which cooks quickly, and by purchasing my tsatziki sauce, which eliminates the sauce-making step. My family loves it served over dressed greens. AnonymousAlexandria, VA11/12/2020So surprisingly filling!! I'm a vegetarian so I subbed out the merguez for Beyond sausage (Italian), cooked it to a crisp and it complimented the dish perfectly. Refreshing & packed with flavor - highly recommend!AnonymousLos Angeles, CA6/22/2020i don't know why, but i wasn't expecting a lot from this recipe, but it actually turned out AMAZING! the flavors and contrasting textures are amazing (shout out of the cucumbers providing crunch up against the chewiness of the rest of the flavors).\n\nin contrast to the other reviewer of this, i used the full two teaspoons of za'atar and loved it.\n\nthings i did differently: i made my own merguez with a spice mixture and ground lamb cause my local grocery store doesn't carry merguez sausages, i don't think that added too much time to the process. i also used barley instead of wheat berries, because again, that's what i have access to (which i cooked with garlic and chicken stock). i also didn't have a pomegranate, however, i would have loved to have one, and i could see how this dish would pop even more with the pomegranate seeds.\ni'm in the middle of eating this, and i already am excited for leftovers during lunch tomorrow.bees???2/6/2019hey! frequent bon appetit recipe maker here. First one i've found where i've had multiple gripes, but don't let that deter you from an otherwise delicious and easy recipe. \n\n1. first gripe is very big and everyone should definitely pay attention to this. DO NOT, do not put 2 teaspoons of za'atar in a half cup of yogurt. i was skeptical and did it with on teaspoon of za'atar and it was MORE than enough. i recommend using a half teaspoon to a teaspoon depending on how spiced you want it\n\n2. this isn't too much of a gripe as it is a matter of process. just make the wheat berries a while before you mix this thing. don't rinse them in cold water. that's so weird and makes them slimy.
