I start to worry about every possible thing that could go wrong: What if the plane crashes? What if there are bed bugs in my plane seat? What if the TSA takes my tweezers because they\u2019re sharp and my facial hair starts to grow abnormally fast and I end up growing a full mustache while I\u2019m on vacation? Sometimes I even feel lightheaded and have blurred vision, sweaty palms, and heart palpitations.Most travel anxiety stems from feeling like you don\u2019t have control over the process. (Let\u2019s be real\u2014unless you\u2019re in first class, you're basically being herded like cattle.) So I decided to address the main issues that contribute to flying generally being a sucky experience for me. First, plane air is dry AF, so I leave with a headache and feel like my entire sinus system has shriveled up. Second, plane food is gross, but I get super hungry when I\u2019m flying. Third, turbulence makes my brain decide that we\u2019re all going to die immediately. And finally, the plane seats are designed for a very small human who wants to lean forward the entire flight, which I\u2019ve never understood.To combat these issues, I\u2019ve developed the following regimen. It is by no means a one-size-fits-all solution to travel anxiety, but it\u2019s definitely helped me get through my process so that I could begin living my best life, on and off the ground.Quick-fix spritzI make my own mist with essential oils to calm my nerves with aromatherapy. I like to use lavender and chamomile for relaxation with a few drops of eucalyptus for sinus clearing. Mix that with filtered water and put in a mist bottle and voila! Spritz your face every time you\u2019re feeling dry or want an instant mood shift.Pack snacksI now make my own snacks before the flight so I can eat on my own schedule and not be hangry in the customs line. One of my favorites is this salty + sweet trail mix. There's also this great list of snacks for every palate that are quick to make and super easy to fly with.Fly highPrior to the trip, I also make indica-strain cannabutter-infused treats. Eating the treats while I\u2019m in the security line has me pretty much asleep by the time we take off. If you live in a place where cannabis isn\u2019t legal, CBD tinctures have a similar body-calming effect but without the high.Treat your feetHave you ever owned a pair of super plush cozy socks? There are very few feelings in the world that beat putting on a comfy pair that hug your toesies just right. So invest in a pair stat, even if only for making your plane ride more luxurious. Bonus points if they're hydrating socks with aloe vera or shea butter in them.Save faceIn addition to my plush socks, I also wear a face mask. No, not an eye mask\u2014a mouth-and-nose-covering face mask. Scarves also work. My stretchy, breathable mask helps block out everyone around me so that I can focus on the calm music in my headphones. The full face coverage also helps with my sinus hydration. Extra credit if you spritz your lavender mist into the mask for the ultimate in relaxation.Let goEvery time I feel a pang of anxiety, I coach myself away from the edge by reminding myself that I am prepared. I am in control of all of the things that I can possibly be in control of to have a successful trip: I've thought about hydration, comfort, satiety, and relaxation! Now, my only job, aside from being prepared, is to let things unfold as they\u2019re meant to. And to hope that the pilot knows how to do their job, too.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishTravelRead MoreLifestyleThese 6 Products Keep Me Healthy Through Every Stage of TravelingGallery6 SlidesBy Nancy Jo Iacoi Recipes you want to make.
