April is the cruelest month, breeding lilacs out of the still-cold ground and shooting pollen directly into my face. May through October aren\u2019t any easier: My eyes itch from the moment the first cherry blossom is posted on Instagram until the last of the so-called leaf peepers returns from the north. I\u2019ve taken every antihistamine, nasal spray, and eye drop known to Duane Reade. Only one thing has helped: local bee pollen, eaten by the spoonful, daily.I\u2019m not one of those all-natural woo-woo people. I\u2019ve tried a number of superfoods, powders, and dusts that are meant to clear my skin and boost my vitality, and I\u2019m pretty sure my hair still grows at the same glacial pace and I\u2019m just as \u201cvital\u201d as I\u2019ve ever been. Local bee pollen is the one hippie thing that I can wholeheartedly get behind because it seems to have genuinely improved my quality of life .This bee pollen from Andrew's Honey helps keep my NYC allergies in check.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigBee pollen is the commonly used term for flower pollen gathered by bees outside the hive.  When they return, they bind the powdery pollen with their saliva to create the packed pellet shape.  Pollen is fed to baby bees as their source of protein, while honey is their carbohydrate source. The saliva breaks down the cell walls of that flower pollen, rendering it more easily digestible. Science!Any bee pollen you consume will be delicious, but only the local stuff has assuaged my allergy symptoms. That\u2019s supposedly because eating bee pollen composed of your allergen partially broken down allows your body to build up an immunity to said allergy. [According to Andrew Cot\u00e9, founder of Andrew's Honey, which I buy at the Union Square Greenmarket in NYC.  \u201cThe basic idea is that if one consumes pollen from that same area where they live and breathe, presumably they\u2019ll build up a tolerance to that pollen. So the next time they breath it in, it won\u2019t be so foreign to their body. If you\u2019re getting a flu shot you\u2019re getting a small amount of the flu virus injected into your body as an antidote to the flu, so it\u2019s the same principle.\u201d These claims are not backed up by the FDA, but your local hippie store proprietor and I both find it to be true. Because of the variations in plant species across the country, eating bee pollen from Ohio hives will do little for allergy sufferers in, say, Colorado.So pick up some local bee pollen at the farmers' market, health food store, or online. You\u2019ll recognize it as granules similar in appearance to Nerds candy, and it can come in a variety of colors based on where you live. My NYC pollen is almost rainbow-colored, while my Connecticut pollen comes in shades of yellow and red. Cot\u00e9 doesn't like to give dosage recommendations but suggests starting small: \u201cThe rule of thumb is for an adult person to take a level teaspoon a day and then go from there.\u201dEven if the health benefits of bee pollen are unconfirmed, the flavor makes it a placebo I\u2019m happy to eat on the regular. It tastes like honey\u2019s nuttier, more floral relative. I recommend enhancing your bee pollen experience by throwing it into a smoothie or using it as an ice cream topping. One of my favorite breakfasts consists of sprinkling bee pollen on a thick slice of toast slathered in ricotta, dotted with berries, and drizzled with balsamic. You can't do that with a nose spray.If you have a history of anaphylactic shock or highly allergic to bee stings, it\u2019s best to avoid bee pollen. If you're pregnant, breast-feeding, or on blood thinners, please check with your doctor before consuming.Explore Bon App\u00e9titBee PollenSuperfoodTrendsRead MoreshoppingThis Honey Is Intense and You're Going to Love ItBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
