Now, there's finally good food.By Marilyn HagertyJune 6, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by John BorgeFacebookTwitterEmailThis is part of our series that celebrates America\u2019s Favorite Neighborhood Restaurants. We asked 80 of the most interesting people we know to reveal the local spots they love the most.Three medium-size meatballs. A rounded serving of mashed potatoes with nice brown gravy in the middle. With this midday special, there was a soft white bun. The cost: $8.50. There was also a steak sandwich for the same price. The soup of the day was chicken wild rice.Steak! And shrimp!\nPHOTO BY JOHN BORGEEver since the Broken Drum Bar and Grill in Grand Forks, North Dakota, added a full-scale kitchen and hired a full-time cook, the place has been buzzing at meal time. There are sloppy Joes on Wednesday and burritos on Thursday. When Friday rolls \u2019round, there\u2019s steak and shrimp.Thirteen years ago when Mike and Jamie Spicer bought this old bar on the northern outskirts of Grand Forks, it was basically just another drinking place. Then the Spicers decided to bring in chef Debbie Johnson.The bar scene.\nPHOTO BY JOHN BORGEThey were so right. Longtime customers still straggle in for beer and alcoholic drinks, but now people come in droves from all over for good food. When I approached the Broken Drum at noon on a Friday in May, the muddy parking lot was overflowing with all kinds of trucks and a few cars. There was absolutely no place to park. Friendly merchants nearby allowed me to park in their lot. \u201cLots of people do,\u201d said one.The soup. With a soft white bun.\nPHOTO BY JOHN BORGEInside the Broken Drum, the tables all around were full. As I settled in at the bar, I noticed a Miller Lite case with ketchup and mustard in it. The silverware was wrapped in a white paper napkin. Jamie Spicer was working behind the bar, taking care of customers at the cash register, and nimbly tidying up as people left. At 1 p.m., he erased the meatballs from the sign behind the bar. They were all gone. But there was still the steak sandwich and more soup.Over the years, I knew the Broken Drum was out there, along with a few other drinking places along Highway 2. I figured it wasn\u2019t my cup of tea until my hairdresser began talking about it. Her dad frequented the Broken Drum. He always liked it. Now with food, he loves the Broken Drum, and his wife goes along with him for meals.The Broken Drum, no longer shady.\nPHOTO BY JOHN BORGEThe staff at the Broken Drum works well with Johnson. And she loves her work. My nicely seasoned meatballs with mashed potatoes arrived on a sturdy paper plate along with a big bun. Her food reaches out beyond the Broken Drum with catering services. In the springtime there are graduation parties and extra calls for catering here and there.The Broken Drum has long changed from a sort of shady place to go. Now it\u2019s beyond an adventure. It\u2019s becoming a trendy place to meet and eat\u2014to see and be seen.Marilyn Hagerty is a columnist for the Grand Forks Herald and had her 15 minutes of Internet fame several years ago after her restaurant review of The Olive Garden went viral.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Explore Bon App\u00e9titNeighborhood RestaurantsRecipes you want to make.
