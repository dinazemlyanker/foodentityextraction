Co-owner Christian Nedergaard first won over Copenhagen with Ved Stranden 10 around the corner, a natural wine bar that happens to be one of the planet\u2019s cooler spots to drink.ORDER THE: squid with poached egg and harissa; Iberian pork with kimchi; and smoked duck hearts with pickled rhubarb, if you see these dishes on the constantly changing menu. The wine list? Smart. Funny! Broken into \u201cuses,\u201d there are bottles for everything, from conversational use to indulgence. Saturdays, starting at 11:30 a.m., there's an exquisite Japanese breakfast.THE VIBE IS: Apartamento magazine meets World of Interiors. The restaurant looks and feels like a wealthy Dane\u2019s living room from the \u201870s, possibly \u201880s. Nedergaard creates new groupings of tables, chairs, and even floor lamps\u2014you will appreciate this if you are over 42, trust us\u2014whenever he feels like it. Other details, like original Jean Prouv\u00e9 sconces in the kitchen, will have design geeks clutching their hearts. Stylish local couples and foursomes of all walks of creative life treat this as their second dining room.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Monday to Saturday, from 11:30 a.m. to midnight. Closed Sunday. Many places are closed on Mondays, but every second Monday is movie night here, complete with a set menu inspired by whichever film is screened.\u2014Christine MuhlkePhoto by Ditte IsagerPhoto by Ditte IsagerWE ALSO LOVECaf\u00e9 Atelier SeptemberThe breezy Indre By caf\u00e9 that\u2019s turned avocado toast into an art formVed Stranden 10Get lost in natural wines at this living room-esque Indre By barRestaurant Pal\u00e6gadeHead to Indre By to eat all the open-face sandwiches (and herring)Explore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
