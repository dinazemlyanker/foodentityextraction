This stuff is gooood.By Julia KramerJune 18, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailChelsie CraigFacebookTwitterEmailEvery once in a while, to confirm my suspicion that nothing in life matters, I go to the Whole Foods in TriBeCa near our office and check out what new beverages have been invented.The other day I was studying inscrutably labeled bottles of \u201cChocolate-Mint Organic Electro Lyte Drink\u201d and \u201cAlo Awaken Wheatgrass Aloe Vera Juice Drink\u201d for what actually might have been entire minutes when I noticed a can called \u201cUp Mountain Swizzle\u201d: a \u201csparkling switchel.\u201dI\u2019ve never really \u201cgotten into switchel,\u201d the elixir that recently made the unlikely leap from Laura Ingalls Wilder types to Acme-clad soundbathers; it\u2019s always tasted to me a bit like...watered down apple cider vinegar (which it essentially is, mixed typically with ginger and a sweetener). I have one interest when it comes to beverages that do not come free from a faucet, and that is that they be carbonated (seltzer, wine, beer\u2014I apply this rule across categories).Not only was Up Mountain Swizzle sparkling, but it promised me three things: \u201cfresh ginger,\u201d which I very much enjoy in GT Kombucha\u2019s Gingerade; \u201capple cider vinegar,\u201d which I love in fire cider, and \u201cmaple syrup\u201d......hmm, no, that might be a dealbreaker. Would it be too sweet?Would I be writing this post if the answer was yes??? I cracked open that beautifully chilled can and holy wow: tart and tangy like a drinking vinegar, not remotely too sweet but instead spicy and gingery like my beloved GT Gingerade, with crisp, fine bubbles like the finest of seltzers. Best of all, it came in a can, and one distinctive facet of my personality is that I prefer drinking out of a can to any other vessel (yes, including a glass).The next day I went back to my Whole Foods safe space (I.e., the aisle where they keep all the experimental beverages). But I wasn\u2019t there to ponder life\u2019s existential questions (what even is a \u201cMaca Mocha\u201d?). I was there to buy five cans of sparkling switchel and get out.Where to Find it: A 6 pack of Up Mountain Swizzle is $18 online, or around $3 a can at Whole Foods and other retailersRelated: Get the recipe for Maple-Ginger Cider SwitchelOr make kombucha with Brad:Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingApple Cider VinegarSummer DrinksRecipes you want to make.
