When something's so easy to make that you don't even need one. Welcome to It's That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.This sandwich is so easy to make it should live in its own column called \u201cIt\u2019s TOO Simple.\u201d In fact, this sandwich is so simple that it didn\u2019t make the cut for the collection of \u201cShort Is Sweet\u201d recipes in our June/July issue (out now)...because no one thought you needed a recipe to make it. And yet, isn\u2019t that the very point of a good ITS? So here we are.This is my loose riff on the quintessential summer sandwich: a classic BLT. But with H (ham) instead of B and definitely extra L. Behold: the HLT. There\u2019s plenty of thinly sliced deli ham, a towering 1.5\u201d-tall lettuce steak (more on that in a second), a bit of perfectly ripe tomato, and just enough seasoning to make those three ingredients sing (yes, I consider cheese a seasoning).Here\u2019s how to make one glorious HLT:Start with two slices of lightly toasted bread. I prefer a pre-sliced multigrain sandwich loaf (like Dave\u2019s Killer Bread\u2019s 21 Whole Grains and Seeds), but you can use anything you like. Spread one slice with a thin layer of Dijon mustard and the other with a thin layer of mayonnaise.Now for those lettuce steaks! I\u2019ve long been inspired by how the iceberg lettuce is cut for the Palace Diner\u2019s famed tuna melt. By volume the sandwich is more lettuce than tuna which, in this humble sandwich enthusiast\u2019s opinion, is the correct ratio.If you\u2019ve ever made a cauliflower steak, you know what we\u2019re going for here: a sturdy and thick plank of lettuce that holds together bite after bite. To make your steak, rest 1 medium head of iceberg lettuce on a work surface on the stem end and slice off one rounded end to create a flat surface; set rounded end aside (\u201csnack lettuce\u201d). Slice off a 1\u00bd\u201d-thick plank of iceberg; if this is way too large to reasonably fit within the perimeters of your sandwich bread, trim plank down to size. Dress your lettuce steak with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and salt and freshly ground black pepper. Dressing it this way ensures tons of crunch AND flavor in every bite.Adding a big slice of well-seasoned lettuce steak guarantees that every bite will be extra crunchy and bursting with flavor.\nPhoto by Emma Fishman, Food Styling by Susie Theodorou, Prop Styling by Elizabeth JaimeBuild your sandwich by topping one bread slice with a slice of cheese (such as pepper jack or Muenster), three oz. sliced deli ham, your lettuce steak, and as many slices of ripe tomato as you desire. Season tomato slices with a little salt and pepper, then close sandwich and slice in half. Serve with crunchy pickles on the side\u2014chef Meherwan Irani recommended The Backyard Food Company\u2019s Czech Sweet & Sour Pickle to me and I\u2019ve never looked back.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimpleRecipes you want to make.
