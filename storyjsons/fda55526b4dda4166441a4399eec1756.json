This salad lets them shine, roasted alongside chickpeas and taken to the next level by an herbaceous cashew cream. Blitzing the base cashew cream recipe with dill, parsley, and scallions brings fresh balance to the carrots. Serve extra sauce as a dip with crudit\u00e9s or grilled bread. \u2014Hetty McKinnonThis is part of our meal planning package, where one recipe can become three quick weeknight meals. Use the rest of your cashew cream to make Broccoli and Cashew Cream Soup or Creamy Cashew Udon With Crispy Mushrooms.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I kept everything separate and assembled each serving. This makes things much easier for leftovers.Michelle San Antonio, TX10/5/2021It takes some time and effort but the delicious results are worth it. The roasted carrots were perfectly seasoned along with the crispy chickpeas - an absolutely delicious dish. My family is still raving about it!MojoMcQToronto 9/16/2021Yes, it takes time to prepare, but well worth it especially if you have an herb garden!   Makes a wonderful side dish or lunch dish all by itself.  Not messy if you arrange the plate carefully and yummyAnonymousLos Angeles9/9/2021This was a lot of active kitchen time for a weeknight meal. Many components worked great on their own - seasoned chickpeas and carrots, herby cashew cream, dressed greens - but all put together, especially with the hot and cold components,  it was just a big mess of food.
