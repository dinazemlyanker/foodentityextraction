And you\u2019ll need to because British Columbia\u2019s largest city not only has the frothy blue Pacific, old-growth forests, and verdant mountains to explore but also talented chefs, bartenders, pastry chefs, and sommeliers that make it a dining destination. (We see you, Montreal.) Here you\u2019ll find an almost comical number of fantastic Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, and Thai restaurants; a thriving craft beer scene; hyperlocal fine-dining that pushes the boundaries; salmon every which way; and more. Be warned: After slipping an \u201ceh\u201d or two into your conversations, drinking Okanagan Valley wine, and eating all the fresh seafood you can in Vancouver, you\u2019ll never want to leave. \u2014Lindsay Anderson The Hit ListFacebookPinterestGrant HarderVij\u2019sGame-changing Indian cuisine and hospitality in Cambie since 1994FacebookPinterestChris GiannakosAsk for LuigiEat all the fresh pasta in Railtown\u2019s most charming spaceFacebookPinterestGrant HarderFisherman\u2019s TerraceDestination-worthy dim sum in a Chinese-food capital (a.k.a.
