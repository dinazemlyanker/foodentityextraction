I doubled the dressing and drizzled more on at the end. Coarse salt on the top. I have also made this adding grilled asparagus. Yum! Everyone loves this.Jen F.Piedmont, CA4/10/2021I could live without cooked carrots...root veggie, not exciting, BUT this was amazing. Truly amazing. Of course, most of that is grilling and the great tangy sauce, but the mint and avocado were nice cool offsets to the sauce. Highly recommend, especially when your CSA has too many carrots. Plus it's tasty hot or room temp. Love it.Anne San Diego, CA3/28/2021Ehhhhhh. Just ok. Anonymous12/17/2020Amazing, delicious and so flavorful.  I've made this numerous times.  I roast the carrots in the oven and always double the recipe.  I find the mint to be delicious but I've also made this with basil.  I've also used Cumin powder when I don't have seeds.  Enjoy!AnonymousHarrison, NY11/21/2020Next time I need to make sure to sear the carrots for longer but this turned out so well and was truly so easy! Highly recommend! AnonymousNew York9/29/2020Literally obsessed with how this turned outAnonymousNew York9/29/2020This is a very easy recipe with a big payoff in flavor.  The dressing was so good I saved what was left in the bottom of the dish and used it as a vinaigrette the next day; didn't want to waste a drop!AnonymousCold Spring Harbor, NY7/31/2020Amazing flavor. The ginger gives the carrots a zing and the the peppers give a surprising kick!AnonymousBelleville,Il6/27/2020Surprisingly amazing. Will be grilling all of my garden carrots this season!AnonymousCalifornia6/17/2020We were surprised by how good this was! My serrano had gone bad so substituted it with a healthy dose of red pepper flakes. Agree with Erockett that the mint should be chopped up. Looking forward to making this again for the next family bbq.AnonymousEl Paso6/10/2020We absolutely LOVE this recipe and are making it again now that it\u2019s getting warmer. It just feels right. The sauce is soooo good. Eric WakelingTustin, CA4/30/2020SO GOOD - I could drink that sauce all day \ud83d\ude0dAnonymousCanada 4/4/2020This was one of the best carrot dishes I\u2019ve ever had.  It was a perfect balance of spicy, sweet, sour and rich.  I\u2019m salivating just reminiscing about this recipe.  I\u2019ll be making this all summer long.OgbmoreChicago6/25/2019Made this last night and it was amazing.  The only thing I had to change was adding more honey to the dressing.  Also I\u2019d chop the mint next time.  But overall a huge winner- I\u2019ll be making this all summer!erockettNew York 6/24/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titCarrotVegetableAvocadoMintHerbs & SpicesEasySideDairy-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreeVegetarianHealthyishGrillingRosh HashanahDinnerRecipes you want to make.
