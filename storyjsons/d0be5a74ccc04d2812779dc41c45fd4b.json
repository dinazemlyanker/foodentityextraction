Local chefs who\u2019ve grown up with the city, as well as transplants who\u2019ve put down roots, have been accumulating a steady roster of James Beard Awards and Michelin stars. The buzz around the city\u2019s best this or that reaches far beyond the metropolitan limits, making Chicago one of the most inviting and exciting foodie destinations to visit and explore. That reputation, however, wouldn\u2019t be what it is without the trailblazing women staking their claim in a male-dominated industry. Meet some of the city\u2019s most extraordinary female chefs who are bringing acclaim, innovation, and diversity into the food city that\u2019s proud to have something for everyone.Sarah Grueneberg, MonteverdeChef Sarah Grueneberg | Photography: Matt HaasTexas native Sarah Grueneberg arrived in Chicago to work under Tony Mantuano of Spiaggia (and eventually other powerhouse pasta-makers like Missy Robbins). To further her repertoire of Italian cuisine, however, she wanted to be hands on\u2013\u2013in Italy, which is where she had the idea to open a made-to-order pasta place. When she returned, she opened Monteverde with friend Meg Sahs; it has received a barrage of awards since its opening in 2015, including a top 50 finalist among Bon Appetit\u2019s \u201cBest New Restaurants.\u201dFresh Pasta at Monteverde | Photography: Matt HaasThe beating heart of the space is the pastificio, which translates to \u201cthe place where the pasta is made.\u201d Sheets, noodles, and all sorts of shapes are churned out as the team prepares dough, crafts silhouettes, and creates delicate bites, soon to be artfully plated. In 2017, Grueneberg received her first James Beard Foundation Award. Oh, and if you recognize her face, it could be from any number of television appearances, including Top Chef: Texas.Beverly Kim, ParachuteChef Beverly Kim | Photography: Matt HaasChicago native and Top Chef finalist Beverly Kim worked in kitchens for 20 years before she opened her own spot. Parachute, the restaurant she opened with her husband, Johnny Clark, is the result of decades of skill and passion. The couple combined their American backgrounds with Kim\u2019s Korean roots\u2013\u2013and included influences from France, Morocco, and China, for good measure\u2013\u2013spinning out one of the most eclectic yet familiar, and sought-after dining experiences in town.Bing Bread at Parachute | Photography: Matt HaasParachute has three consecutive Michelin stars, was a Bon App\u00e9tit \u201cHot Ten\u201d pick, and was a James Beard Award winner for \u201cBest Chef: Great Lakes\u201d in 2019. Featuring everything from potato bing bread (which is stuffed with melted scallions and bacon bits, topped with sesame, and served with sour cream-butter) to Nduja and kimchi fried rice with squid, the Parachute menu is just another example of the breadth of Chicago\u2019s top-notch culinary scene.Stephanie Izard, CabraChef Stephanie Izard | Photography: Matt HaasEver since she became the first female chef to win Top Chef in its fourth season, Stephanie Izard has become synonymous with Chicago cuisine. Though the Chicago-area native was raised in Connecticut, attended university in Michigan, and went to culinary school in Arizona, she returned to her birthplace to begin her career. Her first restaurant, Scylla, opened in Bucktown in 2004\u2013\u2013before her television debut. Since then, Stephanie has been at the helm of a multitude of ventures: Girl & The Goat, Little Goat Diner, and Duck Duck Goat.Tiradito at Cabra | Photography: Matt HaasHer newest adventure is Cabra, which means \u201cgoat\u201d in Spanish. This Peruvian rooftop concept in the Hoxton Hotel is a departure from her usual Chinese and Korean flavors, but with profiles equally as bold. Chef Izard received a James Beard Award for her work at Girl & The Goat.Carrie Nahabedian, BrindilleChef Carrie Nahabedian | Photography: Matt HaasFor 18 years, Carrie Nahabedian\u2019s NAHA, which garnered seven Michelin stars and a James Beard Award, was a mainstay among the city\u2019s top restaurants. Her other acclaimed restaurant, Brindille, is a Parisian bistro which is not only a reflection of her favorite spots in Paris, but has also become known as \u201ca return to chef Carrie\u2019s culinary roots,\u201d serving elevated classics like the buzzed-about dover sole meuni\u00e8re.Dover Sole at Brindille | Photography: Matt HaasThough she\u2019s dotted the globe along her culinary journey, with stints in Atlantic City, Los Angeles, and throughout Europe, it was her hometown to which she returned to open her pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance. Chicago is also where she got her culinary start, at 17 years old, under the late Fernand Gutierrez at The Ritz-Carlton Hotel. Now Nahabedian and her cousin-turned-business partner, Michael Nahabedian, are in the process of opening another new restaurant. But don\u2019t wait for the reveal to get a taste of Chef Carrie\u2019s cuisine. Brindille\u2019s inventive French fare will not disappoint.Diana D\u00e1vila, Mi Tocaya AntojeriaChef Diana D\u00e1vila | Photography: Matt HaasAt age 10, Chicago native Diana D\u00e1vila was already working in her parents\u2019 taqueria. She began her professional career at her family\u2019s upscale restaurant, Hacienda Jalape\u00f1os, and attended culinary school in Oaxaca, Mexico, but she branched out. She worked under Ryan Poli at Butter. She was the first cook, alongside Guiseppe Tentori, at Michelin-starred BOKA.Mushroom Flautas at Mi Tocaya Antojeria | Photography: Matt HaasAfter a stint in D.C. working under Jackie Greenbaum, D\u00e1vila returned to Chicago to open Cantina 1910. Now, with Mi Tocaya Antojeria (a term of endearment meaning \u201cmy namesake\u201d), she is crafting the Mexican cuisine that was passed down to her through her family\u2013\u2013dishes from childhood that lingered in her memory from summers spent in La Huasteca. Bright, bold, and distinct flavors, like those in her signature Peanut Butter y Lengua, are what garnered Antojeria a spot as one of Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s \u201cTop 50 Best New Restaurants.\u201d It\u2019s beef tongue cut into cubes, grilled like a kebab, and topped with an herb reminiscent of cilantro and a sauce of roasted garlic, chiles de \u00e1rbol, cured tomatoes, with peanuts. Authentic, delicious, and unique\u2013\u2013just the way D\u00e1vila always imagined it.Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
