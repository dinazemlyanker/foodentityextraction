Here the goug\u00e8res are flavored with cheddar and pickled jalape\u00f1os as a nod to jalape\u00f1o poppers (shout-out to contributor Aliza Abarbanel for the idea!). You can use any color cheddar you like, but orange will give you the most dramatic look. A word on the method: While an electric mixer makes the job easier, you can definitely do this whole process by hand if you have the arm strength (and patience)\u2014you\u2019ll need to beat vigorously after each egg. An electric mixer, though, is likely to get you a more dramatic rise.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt\u00bctsp. freshly ground black pepper5large eggs, room temperaturePreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 425\u00b0. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Once you turn on the stove, the dough comes together fast\u2014so get prepared: Grate 6\u00bd oz. sharp cheddar, preferably orange, on the large holes of a box grater. Set 2 Tbsp. aside for sprinkling over goug\u00e8res later (you should have about 1\u00bd cups left). Finely chop \u00bd cup sliced pickled jalape\u00f1os on a cutting board. Place 1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour in a small bowl. \u00a0Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 2Cut \u00bd cup (1 stick) unsalted butter into tablespoon-size pieces. Transfer to a medium saucepan and add \u00bd cup whole milk, 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt, \u00bc tsp. freshly ground black pepper, and \u00bd cup water.Step 3Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, add flour all at once, then stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until mixture balls up and no spots of dry flour remain, about 30 seconds. Continue to stir with gusto, smacking the dough along the sides and bottom of the saucepan (you\u2019re looking to dry it out without it taking on any color), 3 minutes. You\u2019ll see a film develop on the bottom of the saucepan that will mostly be reabsorbed as you keep stirring. Let cool slightly, 1\u20132 minutes.Step 4Continuing with your wooden spoon or switching to an electric mixer, add 4 room-temperature large eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition until fully incorporated (about 30 seconds). Don\u2019t worry if the mixture looks curdled or broken. Separate yolk from remaining 1 room-temperature large egg over a small bowl to catch egg white. Reserve yolk for another use; add egg white to pan and beat until mixture comes together into a smooth, glossy, shiny, and thick batter, 1\u20132 minutes. Add cheese and jalape\u00f1os and stir or beat just until evenly distributed.Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 5Using a 1\u00bd Tbsp. (#40) cookie scoop or a (heaping) tablespoon, portion scoops of batter onto prepared baking sheets, spacing 1\" apart. Sprinkle a little of the reserved grated cheese over each goug\u00e8re.Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 6Place in oven and immediately reduce oven temperature to 375\u00b0. Bake until super puffy and golden brown all over, 22\u201328 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.Do ahead: Goug\u00e8res are best the day they\u2019re made but can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature. Reheat in a 350\u00b0 oven until crisp, 5\u20137 minutes. Goug\u00e8res can be formed 1 week ahead. Arrange on baking sheets, \u00bd\" apart, and freeze until solid. Transfer to a resealable freezer bag or freezer-safe airtight container and keep frozen. Arrange on baking sheets as directed and let sit at room temperature while oven preheats. Top with cheese and bake as directed.How would you rate Jalape\u00f1o Popper Goug\u00e8res?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (20)Back to TopTriangleVery good!   Delicious!   They came out perfect.   For those that say 4veggs was too much or their dough was wet, you did not cook your dough enough.   When cooking your dough, you need to dry it out enough where it looks like crumbles.   Take it off the heat and keep on stirring  to let some heat out.  Then add your eggs one at a time and mix thoroughly.    Diane DeFelice. Chef DNew York 3/20/2022These come together pretty easily and are delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect. They are light and savory and fluffy and spicy!  A couple tips: Be sure to fully incorporate each egg\u2026I switched to a hand mixer for this part and it helped immensely. Don\u2019t pull them too early from the oven. Be sure they are golden brown across the domes, otherwise I think they would collapse once pulled from the oven. The only thing I may try for next time is adding more cheese, because I love things cheesy. :) A great appetizer!! LindseySeattle, WA2/13/2022Made most of the batch without the jalape\u00f1os for my guests and those turned out exactly as pictured. The one with jalape\u00f1os puffed in the oven but immediately sank after being pulled out. I\u2019m thinking that It could have been the extra moisture. Won\u2019t stop me from trying to improve on these for the next time. LisaMD1/12/2022Makes me a hero in the kitchen. This is one of my new favorite recipes. They are easy to put together. I\u2019ve served these frequently with high praise from guests each time. Joan King Salado, Texas 1/7/2022I had really wet dough, next time I'll try only two eggs like the previous poster.AnonymousAtlanta12/12/2021I've tried this twice and I also get the really wet dough  Next time I'll try only two eggs like the previous poster.  I should have stopped when I saw that the dough was getting too wet but I still put all of the eggs in.Anonymous12/12/2021Bust.  dough was very wet and when I put on cookie sheet, they looked like pancakes.  Did not rise.  Still tasted good, but more like cheddar cookies than popover.  I've looked at other popover recipes and only 2 eggs are called for.DeannaCalifornia12/3/2021Fantastic recipe.

It drives me crazy when I need to scroll up and down or flip pages back and forth to follow a recipe. I don't have enough ramekins to do everything mise en place.\n\nPlease urge others to do the same!

I loved that I could scoop them as I've only piped once and I need to work on that skill. I made the dough yesterday and froze it because I wanted to bake them fresh today. They came out perfectly. Just wonderful flavor and texture. Definitely will be making these again!!LTSan Leandro CA5/9/2021Where is the PRINT icon?\nSusan GainenSaint Paul MN5/6/2021I did try piping them!
