We love the sour, fresh flavor from the citrus and mint, as well as the fizz from the soda water. The base is super-concentrated because it gets chilled, then diluted by lots of ice.

Strain out the cucumber solids. The cucumber mint lime combo is incredibly refreshing. AnonymousNJ6/4/2020I\u2019ve made this three week in a row as a mid-day treat. Perfectly tart and minty!Anonymous5/2/2020I didn't think I liked fresh mint, but after drinking this I'm converted! With a hefty dose of mint leaves, the puckering acidity of the citrus, and just enough sweetness, this drink was just what I needed on a hot summer day. I used 2 liters of seltzer, which was perfect for our group.AnonymousNew Jersey 8/26/2019I've been craving lemonade all summer, but this stuff is next level. Be warned, all this juicing requires strong hands, but it's worth it. I didn't mix in any alcohol but it would be great with tequila...next time for sure.Nate GLos Angeles, CA8/14/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titPitcher DrinkDrinks AllLimeCitrusFruitLemonMintHerbs & SpicesSummerDrinksDairy-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreeVeganVegetarianNonalcoholicHealthyishRecipes you want to make.
