Chef Eric Sze of New York City\u2019s 886 and wenwen likes pairing a mild, refreshing broth like this one with a spicier broth in a divided pot because switching between the two \u201cmakes your palate dance,\u201d Sze explains. If you want to spice up this broth, however, you can add 4 Tbsp. Pixian chili bean paste and 15 dried chao tian jiao (or dried chiles de \u00e1rbol) and cook for 2 minutes before adding the onions. Even if you aren\u2019t making hot pot, you can use this broth as a flavorful (and vegan!) base for stews, soups, braises\u2014or just something comforting to sip on.Read our ultimate guide to making hot pot at home here.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.
