Pur\u00e9ed corn lends body to the briny yet light broth from the clams, giving this soup its creamy texture while keeping the dish dairy-free.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Add chorizo and cook, breaking up into smaller pieces with a wooden spoon and stirring every minute or so, until browned and crisp, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle in paprika and stir to combine, then scrape chorizo and oil into a small bowl. Wipe out pot.Step 2Pour remaining 2 Tbsp. oil into same pot and set over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring often and adding a splash of water if starting to brown, until softened but not browned, 10\u201312 minutes. Add clams and toss to combine. Cover pot and cook until clams open, 5\u20137 minutes. Uncover and transfer opened clams to a medium bowl, leaving liquid behind. If any clams are still closed, cover pot again and cook remaining clams until opened, about 4 minutes more. Transfer open clams to bowl; discard any that have not opened at this point.

Spoon chorizo and oil over and scatter some cilantro on top.How would you rate Creamy Corn and Clam Chowder With Crispy Chorizo?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (4)Back to TopTriangleThis was incredible! The flavors all complemented each other so well. I crumbled some queso fresco on top and it took it to the next level. I plan on adding some diced potatoes next time to make it a little more hearty.AnonymousPortland, OR9/4/2021This was wonderful. It had great depth of flavor and came together quickly. Next time I will probably shuck the clams before serving for ease of eating and just toss a couple back in to each soup plate for eye appeal. The chorizo and cilantro played off the creaminess of the dish well. Excellent!DFinVTBarre, Vt9/1/2021We just loved this recipe! It didn't take long to make, and the flavors were complex and beyond delicious. I tested it out on my family, and I plan to make it this weekend for guests. I added shrimp to the soup, four per person. As a main dish, this served three people along with a salad and bread.Caryn Albuquerque, NM8/31/2021This was delicious.  I actually used a little more chorizo and just mixed it in.  Also\u2014I boiled my corn, then removed from cob, and then used that water when it came time to add 3 cups.
