He rewards all who brave the line with lovely traditional buns flecked with black cardamom, often hot from the oven, as well as other treats like croissants.ORDER THE: cardamom rolls (saffron around the holidays), croissants, seeded rolls with Comt\u00e9, tebirkes (poppy seed pastry), and seasonal tarts. Toward the end of the day, sourdough loaves emerge to take home for dinner. Stock up on the seedy rolls for breakfast the next day, perfect with a coffee made from cult Swedish roaster Koppi.THE VIBE IS: minimal but somehow very Instagrammable, thanks to the great light and pretty ceramics.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Wednesday to Saturday from 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Closed Monday and Tuesday.\u2014Christine MuhlkePhoto by Ditte IsagerWE ALSO LOVEMirabellePlan a mini croissant- and yogurt-filled vacation at this caf\u00e9-like spot in N\u00f8rreboroDemocratic CoffeeOne more reason to love the library (or at least this Indre By one): buttery croissants108Noma\u2019s more casual spin-off in Christianshavn, with kombucha-shellacked pastriesExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
