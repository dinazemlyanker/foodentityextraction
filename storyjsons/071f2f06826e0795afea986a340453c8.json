Chinese tea drinking rarely involves dairy, but the British influence in Hong Kong created what recipe developer and fashion designer Peter Som describes as a magical elixir made by combining strong black tea and sweetened condensed milk. Sweet, bitter, creamy, and so, so good, milk tea is very drinkable on its own and is an irresistible base for this bread pudding. Melted and warmed vanilla ice cream makes for a lightning-fast, no-stress cre\u0300me anglaise.For the rest of Som\u2019s Thanksgiving menu, see his recipes for Asian Pear Salad With Peanut-Lime Dressing, Roasted Brussels Sprouts With Gochujang Brown Butter, Sweet Potato Tian, Dutch Oven No Mai Fan, and Char Siu Wellington.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

We all liked the flavor, though.  But the tea did not really come through.\n\nI have a much better, custardy recipe that maybe I will  adapt to the tea infusion.  As is, it is a good brunch dish, IMO, but not a decadent Holliday dessert. So 4 stars as French Toast.JodiNYC12/26/2021This was tasty but didn't really think it had a milk tea flavor. It was overly sweet and would omit the granulated sugar since the creme anglaise is plenty sweet. KLAUMidland Park, NJ12/5/2021Delicious! Made this with challah (what our store had) and earl grey tea. Shared with family for Thanksgiving breakfast. Not too sweet, just right flavor. Keeping in my repertoire!HannaMadison, NJ11/26/2021I haven\u2019t made this yet but I guess it would be possible to use challah instead of the brioche?NancyVictoria, BC11/16/2021Could you use coconut cream or milk in lieu of condensed milk for those who are dairy intolerant?Lynne CPortland, OR11/12/2021A delicious and comforting dessert. I love milk tea and this reminded me of all the aromatics from a good cup of tea. I used 24g of loose leaf instead and strained the milk afterwards. I also used 300ml of condensed milk and it turned out perfect. Definitely making this again. Andy GVancouver, BC11/1/2021Our cooking club made this and here are our thoughts:  I could not taste the tea in this and it was overpowered by the condensed milk, but the taste was excellent!, usually don't care for bread pudding but this had a nice flavor and was great! Very mild taste, don't like bp but liked this! Loved it, Very good, not change a thing!Liz PetersonLutz, Florida10/31/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titTeaBread PuddingDessertThanksgivingBakeLycheeFruitBriocheRaisinDried FruitRecipes you want to make.
