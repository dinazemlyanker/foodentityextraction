The interplay between the fish sauce, chiles, and sweet juicy fruits makes this a simple but refreshing dish.Ingredients4 Servings1Tbsp. small dried shrimp (optional)\u00bccup unsweetened shredded coconut4garlic cloves2red Thai chiles, coarsely chopped4Tbsp. fresh lime juice4tsp. granulated sugar4tsp. fish sauce2apples, preferably Pink Lady, cored, cut into 1\" pieces2Asian pears, cored, cut into 2\" pieces1small shallot, thinly sliced into rings1cup red grapes, halved crosswise\u00bccup coarsely chopped cilantro\u00bccup mint leaves, torn if largePreparationStep 1If using, toast dried shrimp in a dry small skillet, tossing occasionally, over medium heat until slightly lighter in appearance and a little crispy, about 4 minutes.
