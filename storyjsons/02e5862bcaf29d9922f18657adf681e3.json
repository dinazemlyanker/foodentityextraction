See our past recommendations here!As much as I fancy myself the type of person who experiments with new and creative dinner recipes every night, the reality is that I\u2019m probably eating a pile of saut\u00e9ed kale and some fried eggs with hot sauce for the third time this week. And if I didn\u2019t have to read new cookbooks such as Abra Berens\u2019s Ruffage for my job, I doubt I would ever deviate from this basic formula.Ruffage, which is billed as a \u201cpractical guide to vegetables,\u201d is the kind of book I wish I\u2019d had when I was a line cook, because it is a master class in improvising with what you have and what\u2019s in season right now, which are pretty much the two foundations of intuitive cooking. There are recipes for nearly 30 different vegetables, but the real gold mine of this book are the hundreds of little variations Berens provides for how to riff on the recipes as written. She doesn't just give you a beautiful recipe for, say, blistered cucumbers with cumin yogurt and parsley, she shows you how those same cucumbers would be delicious paired with peaches, mint, and chili oil, or tossed with buttermilk, tomatoes, and herbs. This is the book I want on my shelf right next to my dog-eared, sauce-flecked copy of Joshua McFadden\u2019s Six Seasons. It's a total classic.Buy it: Ruffage: A Practical Guide to Vegetables, $25.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish Loves ItCookbooksShoppingRead MoreLifestyleThese Bookends Are My Excuse for Buying All the BooksBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
