Puglisi was one of the first to strike out on his own\u2014and he\u2019s been the most successful by far. (He\u2019s behind favorites Manfreds, B\u00e6st, and Mirabelle.) His tasting-menu restaurant has set the bar for countless ambitious young chefs around the world\u2014and not just with its leather aprons and silverware drawers but due to Puglisi\u2019s approach to in-the-moment seasonal local cuisine that\u2019s both careful and extreme.ORDER THE: tasting menu with wine pairings, all the way. (The three-course one, if you\u2019re pressed for time. But really?) Here, Puglisi conjures dishes that push the limits of flavor, like dried yellow beet sashimi with elderflower. If you\u2019re the kind of person who doesn\u2019t like to fill up on the bread, develop temporary amnesia: Puglisi\u2019s sourdough is among the world\u2019s best.THE VIBE IS: reverent but cool. Maybe it\u2019s because of all that natural wine being poured. You\u2019ll find visiting chefs, local creatives, and dignified gastronauts from around the world in the lo-fi brick-and-wood room and perched at the kitchen counter.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open for dinner Tuesday to Saturday, from 5 p.m. to midnight, and lunch Friday and Saturday, from noon to 3 p.m. Closed Sunday and Monday. Be sure to book ahead.\u2014Christine MuhlkePhoto by Ditte IsagerWE ALSO LOVEB\u00e6stPizza perfected in Inner N\u00f8rrebroMirabellePlan a mini croissant- and yogurt-filled vacation at this caf\u00e9-like spot in N\u00f8rreboroManfredsThe still boundary-pushing, still neighborhood-y restaurant in Outer N\u00f8rrebroExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
