No tomatoes, just lots of chiles, beans, and aggressive use of your spice cabinet, and you can create a chili that\u2019s perfect for the in-between season, when it\u2019s still cold, but you refuse to wear a winter coat anymore. This dish can be made with water, but chicken broth adds extra oomph.Ingredients4 - 6 Servings\u00bccup extra-virgin olive oil2Tbsp. unsalted butter1large white onion, finely chopped, plus more, sliced, for servingKosher salt8garlic cloves, thinly sliced2poblano chiles, seeds removed, finely chopped2Anaheim chiles or Cubanelle peppers or 1 poblano chile, seeds removed, finely chopped1jalape\u00f1o, seeds removed, finely chopped1tsp. ground cumin1tsp. ground oregano1tsp. mild red pepper flakes1tsp. paprika\u00bdhead of escarole, trimmed, chopped314-oz. cans cannellini (white kidney) beans, rinsed4cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth or water2Tbsp.

Caveat; this is really not a spring soup, since peppers are Summer to early Fall; we have oodles frozen from last year's garden, so we were good to go.AnonymousArlington Heights, IL9/11/2021My sister said it was one of the best soups she'd ever tasted. Didn't have anaheim or jalape\u00f1o, so I just used three poblanos. Didn't have escarole, so I used baby kale. Came out wonderfully and will be adding it to the rotation. Adding the recommended sour cream and crumbled tortilla chips was key to elevating this soup.Whitney Pomona, CA6/17/2021Huge hit!! Used soft kale instead of escarole, and added Shredded Chicken and New Potatoes for some substance. Also added fresh thyme towards the end before the spinach. Delicious. Am going to make again and again. MeganAtlanta5/17/2021Wonderful bean soup! I doubled the escarole (because I had it) and skipped the spinach (because I didn't have it). Also, roasted the peppers pretty well in the oven then pureed with the garlic, mostly because I didn't feel like chopping all the peppers. Turned out to be one of my favorite soups. Christie HahnChicago, IL4/9/2021Great soup. I added some Portuguese chourico and sauteed that onions/peppers in the rendered fat which really added some nice flavor. I'd agree with the other commenters about the lime, it needs a little acidity at the end, which really ups the brightness of the dish as well. Cilantro goes well as a garnish too.Davey Boy4/2/2021Delicious! Super flavorful for such a quick chili. We also could not find escarole so we used Belgian endive. We followed the suggestion of another reviewer and added lime. We also only used jalape\u00f1os as we were shopping at Trader Joe\u2019s and they do not carry other peppers. Would definitely make again! Is reminiscent of a chicken chili, sans chicken. LeahBellingham, WA4/1/2021Fabbbbulous. I agree with the other reviews about the surprisingly robust flavor! Deep and warm green pepper vibes with just a little heat. I did totally forget the 2 poblanos accidentally, however, oops. I used kale instead of escarole and it was delish. HCPhiladelphia, PA3/31/2021This was wonderful!  Way way way more flavorful and robust than I would have guessed, but light enough that you do feel a bit springy with it.  Made it with vegetarian broth (nothing fancy just beyond boullion not-chicken base and a little veg. base).  Totally would make this again in a heartbeat.  Froze a few portions for later, feeling it will do well thawing out and reheating.  Thank you thank you for an excellent, fresh, recipe!  Amanda C.3/31/2021This was decent. I had to use kale instead of escarole but it worked just fine. I also added some diced chicken I had. I will definitely make again and try to improve on it.LessThanNothingDenver3/28/2021Delicious and easy. Couldn't find escarole - used belgian endive which worked well. I didn't have ground oregano, so I ground some loose mexican oregano I had in the mortar and pestle...PSA - I recommend the use of disposable food prep gloves when cutting peppers. Jerry XerxesDenton, TX3/23/2021This was good, just needed a squeeze of lime at the end!KateNew York 3/23/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titChiliStewSoups and StewsCannellini BeanWhite BeanBeanVegetableEscaroleChicoryLeafy GreensSpinachSpringEasyWeeknight MealsOne-Pot MealsMainNut-FreeGluten-FreeHealthyishBraiseDinnerRecipes you want to make.
