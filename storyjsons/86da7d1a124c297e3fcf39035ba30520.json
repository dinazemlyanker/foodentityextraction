See our past recommendations here!Since I moved a few months ago, my glassware shelf is in a sorry state, populated by a ragtag team of Mason jars, repurposed condiment jars, and those cute sake cups with the panda. That's why these kokomo cups from Upstate, Kalen Kaminski's line of hand-dyed goods, are at the tippy-top of my wish list.At just three inches tall, the glass-blown tumblers fulfill just about every drinking need I encounter, from morning espresso to evening p\u00e9t-nat to late-night nips of mezcal\u2014and they do so with supremely low-key style. You could even use them as dinner-table water glasses (just keep a pitcher on hand for refills).If I were in a higher income bracket, I'd replace my entire shelf with kokomo glasses. For now, I'd be content with a set of two\u2014okay, maybe four\u2014so I can finally retire a few of those condiment jars. The panda cups, on the other hand, are staying. \u2014Amanda Shapiro, Healthyish editorBuy it: Hand Dyed Kokomo Cup, $68.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
