Am I really telling you not to roast your bird, to not present a Norman Rockwell-worthy centerpiece for your holiday table?Yes, that is exactly what I\u2019m telling you.A couple years ago, I riffed on Bon App\u2019s braised turkey legs recipe and it was a revelation\u2014rich, tender, fall-off-the-bone meat, cloaked in a silky, oniony, wine-y gravy. It was like turkey carnitas.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!And I was even able to cook the entire dish ahead of time, so I never had to worry about frantically checking the doneness of the bird, or comparing the temperature of the dark meat to the white, or fretting about opening the oven door too often.The the most important step in the braising process is your first step: Call your butcher or ask the meat counter of your go-to grocery store if they can break down a turkey for you. You want the legs and thighs removed (I like them separated, so you\u2019re left with four large pieces), and then have the breast meat taken off the bone.Christopher TestaniThis will allow you to braise your dark meat in a Dutch oven early in the day. And if your butcher counter is a full-service type joint, they\u2019ll roll and season and maybe even wrap your turkey breast in pancetta or bacon. Then you can roast it in the oven to pin-point doneness as a porchetta-style roast turkey, in far less time than it would take to cook a whole bird.When my wife and I last hosted two years ago, the rolled breast was...good. Ideal for next-day leftover sandwiches.But the braised dark meat stole the show. Just before sitting down, I hit the slow-cooked legs and thighs with the broiler to crisp up the skin. Then I pulled the meat off the bone, shredding it with a couple forks and set it on a large platter. I  studded it with cipollini onions from the pot and bathed the whole thing with the fragrant braising liquid.There were no leftovers. And what\u2019s a better compliment than that?Get the recipes:Stock-Braised Turkey LegsPorchetta-Style Turkey BreastExplore Bon App\u00e9titTurkeyThanksgivingAdam NewsletterRecipes you want to make.
