From the Philippines\u2014the name means \u201cmix-mix\" in Tagalog\u2014the refreshing dish layers shaved ice and condensed milk on top of all sorts of ingredients for an end result that packs in lots of contrasting textures, from chewy to crunchy, creamy to sticky. While components vary, you'll find some common add-ins at most halo-halo carts and bars: jellies, flan, macapuno, palm seeds, sweetened red beans, shaved ice, ube ice cream, fresh fruit, toasted coconut flakes, pinipig. My version uses mango jelly with fresh fruit set into it as well as pandan-infused sweetened condensed milk.I encourage you to choose your own adventure, layering the elements in a tall glass or wide bowl. Make sure to use a long-handled spoon to reach everything, and for mixing and swirling. By the end, once things are mostly melted, you can practically drink it. \u2014Tiana GeeAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Remove from heat and stir in mango pur\u00e9e. Pour jelly into a 9x5\" loaf pan. Carefully add remaining mangoes and stir to combine. Cover jelly tightly and chill until set, 20\u201330 minutes.Do ahead: Mango jelly can be made 5 days ahead. Keep chilled.FlanStep 3Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0. Cook sugar and 1 Tbsp. water in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved, then cook, undisturbed, swirling pan occasionally and brushing down sides with a wet pastry brush as needed, until mixture turns deep amber, 7\u20139 minutes. Scrape caramel into another 9x5\" loaf pan.Step 4Whisk egg yolks, coconut milk, condensed milk, vanilla, and salt in a medium bowl to combine. Pour through a fine-mesh sieve into loaf pan with caramel. Cover with foil. Set inside a roasting pan and place on oven rack. Carefully pour hot water into roasting pan to come halfway up sides of loaf pan (a tea kettle makes this easy if you have one).Step 5Bake flan until just set in the center (it should still wobble a little when gently jiggled) and barely golden on top, 55\u201360 minutes. Let cool (still covered), then chill until cold, at least 4 hours.\u00a0Do ahead: Flan can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled.Corn and AssemblyStep 6Spread out corn on a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle sugar and salt over, then drizzle oil over and toss to combine. Roast until crisped slightly but not yet browned and a little sticky, 12\u201315 minutes. Let cool.Step 7Meanwhile, bring sago pearls and \u00bd cup water to a simmer in a small saucepan and cook until translucent and firm-tender, 8\u201310 minutes. Drain, then combine in a small bowl with coconut milk, stirring well to separate pearls. Let cool.Step 8Toast coconut in a small skillet over medium heat until edges start to brown and crisp, about 5 minutes (be careful not to overcook).Step 9Cut flan into 1\"pieces and divide some among tall glasses or wide bowls. Cut out mango jelly into desired shapes and arrange on top, then spoon in ice cream, condensed milk, shaved ice, strawberries, macapuno, palm seeds, corn, sago pearls, toasted coconut, red beans, and pinipig as desired.How would you rate Halo-Halo?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (4)Back to TopTriangleGrowing up we had halo halo all the time, especially in the summer. However no one had ever made the add ins, except for the flan and ube. I don't eat it with strawberries or mangoes. Try with Jackfruit (langka) it's my favorite. I just bought coconut jelly, red mung beans (mongo) and the langka. Sometimes I'll put macapuno in it. And I use Evaporated milk, tastes better (at least to me.)VeronicaUtah9/9/2021After trying halo halo in a Hawaiian diner, my husband and I joked that this concoction was invented by a thrifty mama with a few spoonfuls of this and that left over who threw it all together in a pretty dish and exclaimed \"oohh is it ever GOOD\" to get her kids to eat it! The diner version was not a hit, but this version looks very yummy with the mango jelly and homemade flan!JZHawaii7/31/2021This looks great! I think y'all forgot the baking step for the flan, though!AnonymousAtlanta, GA7/11/2021halo-halo is the best! \ud83d\udcaf\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddedchristinaseoul7/8/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titParfaitDessertFilipinoSoutheast AsianAsianMangoStone FruitFruitCornVegetableCoconut MilkOther IngredientsCoconutStrawberryBerrySummerGluten-FreeBakingSimmerRecipes you want to make.
