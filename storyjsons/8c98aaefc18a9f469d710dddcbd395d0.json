You sit cross-legged on thin, flat zabuton (floor cushions) at a very low table, and the servers wear traditional kimonos and kneel beside you. The tofu and yuba tasting menu is incredible: Imagine many courses of fresh tofus (including a matcha-infused variety with a springy texture), miso soup with rich seaweed and bracing shiso, and donabe with tea-soaked rice, crispy little fishes, and roe. That last dish was truly one of our favorite things we ate in Tokyo\u2014subtle but so heartwarming.\u201d\u2014Jen Pelka of The Riddler and Charles Billies of Souvla, both in San FranciscoExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
