The cucumbers released a lot more water than I expected, so plan for that. I don\u2019t have any other comments, love this recipe!ElleLA8/10/2021This was a revelation! I have a bad habit of letting my Persian cukes hang in the fridge a bit too long and get soft so last night I was determined to make a salad with ones I had on hand. I stumbled across this recipe and wow. Such little effort, such big rewards. The dressing is tangy, sweet, and highly addictive. We'd also made chicken for dinner which we were dipping in the juices it was so good. The only edit we made was to smash the Serrano in a mortar and pestle along with garlic. I find that makes dressings a bit spicier which I love.emilyrBoston, MA4/6/2020This was a nice salad! Made it as a side for carnitas tacos (that recipe is on Basically) and it was super refreshing. I'm finding it hard to believe you could smash the cucumbers with a rolling pin without horribly bruising them - I hacked at them with the back of a chef's knife and then ripped them up where the cuts were, which worked well. Also, I doubled the recipe and it made wayyyyy too much dressing - I feel like even a single batch of dressing would be too much for twice the cucumbers. Lastly, I wouldn't count on keeping any leftovers since it starts to taste like pickles, so eat it all up the night you make it!soapnanaChicago4/30/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladChineseEast AsianAsianCucumberVegetableChileQuickEasySideDairy-FreeGluten-FreeHealthyishDinnerRecipes you want to make.
