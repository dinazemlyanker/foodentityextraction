But if you\u2019re not also adding \u201ceat a tomato pie\u201d to your list, then you\u2019re missing out on one of the best things on the new Beddia menu.Tomato pie is a Philly staple (just ask the folks at Sarcone\u2019s or Gaeta\u2019s), and it\u2019s something the man, the myth, the legend chef-owner Joe Beddia developed in between closing the first iteration of his pizzeria in 2018 and opening this new one this past April. It\u2019s like focaccia covered with a garlicky layer of tomato sauce and best served at room temperature.At Beddia, they ferment the pizza dough a little longer (a cold and slow proof gives it more flavor), then let it rise in a pan with tons of grassy extra virgin olive oil. They bake the dough with a thick swipe of tomato sauce, which is also used on Beddia\u2019s famous pies, then slather on more sauce when it comes out of the oven. Finally, the whole thing is topped with ultra-fragrant Sicilian oregano and another glug of glossy olive oil. The result is a crispy-gone-soggy, super savory bite of Philadelphia culinary culture.So yeah, it may not be the first thing people think to wait hours and hours for at Beddia, but it\u2019s definitely my thing.Go there: Pizzeria BeddiaExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendPhiladelphiaPizzaRead MorerestaurantsJoe Beddia\u2019s New Pizza Place Is Over-Hyped, According to Joe BeddiaBy Dayna EvansRecipes you want to make.
