But there they were at Lineage, the newest restaurant from chef Sheldon Simeon in Wailea, Maui, tossed in adobo and served with chunks of juicy tomato and sweet Maui onion. I didn\u2019t even know you could cook and eat turkey tails! So naturally I had to try them, and it was mind-blowing. How did Simeon turn oily turkey organs into the most delicious, orange-chicken-esque dish? Here he breaks it down.The TailTechnically the oily gland that holds the turkey\u2019s feathers together (don\u2019t google it), the tail has long been a reliable cheap cut for Hawaii residents like chef Sheldon Simeon and his crew of Filipino cooks. They grew up eating the tails steamed in taro leaves for laulau or slicked in adobo sauce.The Adobo\u201cWe love adobo so much it\u2019s scary,\u201d Simeon says of his obsession with the staple Filipino sauce. He\u2019s been tweaking his recipe for years, adding berbere to bring out the pepperiness and heat and holding back on the vinegar after sampling more soy sauce\u2013forward versions. The result is a deeply rich adobo that you\u2019ll want to steal a quart container of (not guilty).The Fry-Braise-FrySimeon picked up on this technique when he was traveling in the Philippines a few years ago: The tail is fried to get some color, then braised in the adobo sauce and fried once more before going back into the sauce to finish. That final fry seals each tail in a crispy, crackled shell akin to, in Simeon\u2019s words, \u201cthe joy of eating chicken wings.\u201dThe MarinadeThe turkey tails bathe in a mixture of soy sauce and apple cider vinegar, bobbing with peppercorns, bay leaf, ginger, and garlic, to tenderize the meat and echo the flavors of the adobo sauce. \u201cWe are adding these same ingredients but at different moments in the recipe, which brings a more complex flavor in the end,\u201d he says.The SaladYou can\u2019t eat adobo without a raw tomato salad. \u201cIt\u2019s a very Filipino thing to have,\u201d Simeon says. It cuts through the glorious fattiness of those glossy turkey tails but also gives the dish a needed hit of acid. Hunks of sweet Maui onion (duh) and tomato are tossed with a little olive oil and fish sauce, then sprinkled on top of the turkey tails for a refreshing and actually useful garnish.Explore Bon App\u00e9titMauiRestaurantsDish DecodedRead MorecultureI Instagram-Stalked This Croissant, So I Found Out How It\u2019s MadeBy Rachel KartenRecipes you want to make.
