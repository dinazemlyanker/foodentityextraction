These two passions have long been in conflict, considering that the music I dance to usually gets good between 2 and 6 a.m. There are many ways, legal and otherwise, to deal with this problem, but I hadn\u2019t found a solution that worked for me until I found White Label Mate Soda. Allow me some brief background: For decades, the club kids of Europe have been drinking a carbonated, lightly sweetened beverage called Club-Mate to fuel their all-night raves. (And mate, made from the naturally caffeinated leaves of the South American holly tree, has been steeped and sipped as tea for thousands of years.) But the soda was very hard to find in the States until recently, when an enterprising trio of music nerds began making a knockoff version right here in Brooklyn. You can find their White Label Mate Soda in bodegas, bars, and clubs around the borough, and it\u2019s the most delicious energy drink I\u2019ve ever tasted. It\u2019s naturally low in sugar, it gives me the gentlest bump when I\u2019m starting to flag, and\u2014could it be? yes it\u2019s true!\u2014there\u2019s ashwagandha, a stress-reducing adaptogen, in there. Who knew that partying could be so good for you?Buy It: White Label Mate Soda, $3 at mercato.comAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
