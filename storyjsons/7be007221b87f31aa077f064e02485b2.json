See our past recommendations here!I used to lie to my dentist. In my defense, I\u2019m pretty sure everyone lies about flossing, because it\u2019s the most tedious act of self-care on the planet. That is, until Cocofloss entered the oral hygiene game.Created by a practicing dentist and her artist sister, Cocofloss is coated in coconut oil and gently flavored for an all-around better flossing experience.  I'll be real: Luxury dental floss is a luxury indeed. But after I saw several glowing Sephora reviews from dental hygienists, I needed to try it for myself. My gums need all the help they can get.The tropical packaging and fresh coconut scent were admittedly very cute, but for once, the actual feeling of flossing won me over. That's thanks to the addition of coconut oil, a natural antimicrobial that soothes while removing slippery plaque and sticky food scraps. The post-flossing clean mouth feeling is nice, but the smug sense of self-satisfaction that comes from daily flossing is the best feeling of all.\u2014Aliza Abarbanel, assistant editorBuy it: Cocofloss, $9All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
