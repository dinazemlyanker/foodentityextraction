Actually, check that. Knowlton was telling me what we\u2019d order.\u201cWe\u2019ll get the chorizo-stuffed dates because you can\u2019t not. Maybe we\u2019ll try that seasonal shaved salad. The braised lamb\u2019s neck. And I\u2019m going to order this orange wine you\u2019re probably not going to like, but we\u2019ll get it anyway. Just trust me.\u201dNow, normally, I can be kind of controlling when it comes to dining out. But this was one of many moments over the past seven years when I just sat back and reached for my cocktail. I\u2019d been out with Knowlton enough times to know better than to interfere. As the deputy editor of this magazine and its chief critic, he approaches restaurants with the kind of studied exactitude of some old-timer baseball scout.Shortly after sitting down, he\u2019ll pull out his notebook and jot down a bunch of\u2026I\u2019m not exactly sure what. He eagerly engages bartenders, asking about this tincture or that bottle of amaro. He\u2019ll set servers on their heels, quizzing them on the specials.In our industry there are people like me\u2014who like to think they know what they\u2019re talking about\u2014and there are people like Knowlton, who make it their job.Not that I always appreciated this fact. When I took over as editor in chief of Bon App\u00e9tit in 2011, Cond\u00e9 Nast had just moved the magazine\u2019s editorial operations from L.A. to New York. I was tasked with rebuilding the brand. And Knowlton, who was already based in New York and had been with the magazine for 11 years, had the unenviable chore of having to lobby to keep his job. Figuring we ought to have at least one person on staff familiar with Bon App\u2019s DNA, I decided to keep him.Perhaps Knowlton's greatest contribution to BA: His grandmother's pimiento cheese recipe.\nPhoto by Laura MurrayIt didn\u2019t take long for me to realize how lucky I got. Knowlton wasn\u2019t just aware of the magazine\u2019s DNA; he was its DNA.Since 2011 he has been that guy on staff we all turn to. Again and again. Unsure of whether a budding trend is really a trend, we just ask Knowlton. Can\u2019t find a contact for that chef we want to cover in the magazine? \u201cAsk Knowlton.\u201d Wait, should we even be featuring that chef? \u201cAsk Knowlton.\u201dA few months ago he took me out to lunch. We grabbed seats at the bar, and then there was an awkward pause. He gave me that look\u2014the one that any boss is regretfully familiar with. With a remorseful smile, he simply said, \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to go.\u201dI sighed. Selfishly. Knowlton has been at Bon App for 18 years. He captained our Hot 10 Best New Restaurants issue for the past seven. Before that he was The Foodist (a dorky name, yes, but a great column). And for too long, he allowed all of us\u2014especially me\u2014to not do our jobs. I can\u2019t tell you how many chefs I haven\u2019t reached out to or restaurants I should\u2019ve gone to but didn\u2019t because I figured: Knowlton\u2019s got it.He and his wife and two daughters are moving to Austin, where they can get all those things they can\u2019t have in Brooklyn: a house, a yard, a grill, and really good breakfast tacos.He will continue on as an editor at large for Bon App\u00e9tit. And he\u2019ll steer this year\u2019s Hot 10 package. But if we need a random restaurant question answered at, say, 2:45 p.m. on a Tuesday, well, we\u2019re on our own. He\u2019s been prepping us for this moment since we relaunched the brand. We just didn\u2019t know it.Read some of Knowlton's pieces:A Short History of My Long Drinking LifeI\u2019ve learned to respect drinking, the craft of it, the camaraderie of it, and the importance of it in my life.View StoryWelcome to Hillstone, America's Favorite RestaurantView StoryWhat It's Like to Work at the Waffle House for 24 Hours StraightView StoryAnd watch him work 24 hours at Katz's:Explore Bon App\u00e9titAndrew KnowltonLetter From The EditorRead MorerestaurantsWelcome to Hillstone, America's Favorite RestaurantBy Andrew KnowltonPhotography by Eva KolenkoRecipes you want to make.
