It checked all the boxes: a high-profile chef-owner (Christopher Kostow); a fine-dining sister property (The Restaurant at Meadowood); a very on-trend wood-fired kitchen; an attached farm; and a rising star  leading the kitchen, Katianna Hong. Hong was plucked from her role as chef de cuisine at Meadowood, leaving behind her tweezers for a more rustic kind of cooking. Once The Charter Oak finally did open, it was an immediate hit. And so was Hong. She earned numerous accolades\u2014including a spot on our 2018 Top 50 best new restaurants list\u2014and became a fixture in Napa. So it came as a surprise when Eater announced this past July that Hong was not just going on maternity leave but departing from The Charter Oak altogether. Why would she would leave the place where she made her name? And why now, so soon after opening, and while she\u2019s at the very top of her game? Here, in her own words, Hong explains her choice to say goodbye to the restaurant industry...for now. \u2014Elyse InamineFriday, July 19, was my last dinner service at The Charter Oak. It was good, but, you know, I\u2019m ready to move on. I\u2019ve been thinking about this question with my husband John Hong for a while now: \u201cWhat are we going to do next?\u201d But once I became pregnant, we began asking ourselves another question: \u201cHow are we going to still be chefs and start a family?\u201dWhat motivated me as a young chef in the first place was this idea of living a really creative lifestyle. That\u2019s why I was attracted to the three Michelin star style of cooking earlier in my career. You got glimpses of people\u2019s genius, which is exciting and rare. And Meadowood was an insanely creative environment.I don\u2019t mean to speak badly of it, but when you\u2019re in your 20s, you\u2019re free. You don\u2019t have any outside responsibilities. You can dedicate all your time and focus to work. That\u2019s what John and I did. We missed holidays. We didn\u2019t maintain relationships with friends who weren\u2019t in the industry. We lived in this bubble of work and didn\u2019t really think about our future. I loved it\u2014the commitment, the structure, the creativity, the intensity, the pressure, the professionalism.Looking back, I\u2019m grateful for my nine years at Meadowood, but it was so ego-driven. It turned into an attention-seeking thing, not a personal thing. And when you\u2019re working head down for so many years, you put personal growth on hold. Trying to figure out what interested me, what made me happy, what I needed to build for my future outside of work\u2014that got overwhelming. It was easier to just work more.After a while, I felt like that wasn\u2019t enough for me. I wanted more balance in my life, so it wasn\u2019t all about work. It was then that I understood it was time to move on. So three years ago, I left my position as the chef de cuisine at Meadowood and went on to open The Charter Oak with Christopher Kostow. John needed an opportunity to be in charge, so he took my old position. I needed a change.The Charter Oak opened my eyes. I worked with different types of people who had other interests and families outside of the restaurant. I realized that people can have different priorities. Before, I was so all or nothing; I\u2019d look at them and think, \u201cOh, you\u2019re not really committed.\u201dJohn has always wanted a family. He\u2019d been bugging me for five years to have kids. I was always like, \u201cMaybe next year.\u201d In my mind, I just thought there was going to be a perfect time and it wasn\u2019t now. I realize this was more of an excuse, like \u201cOh, I can\u2019t because I have to work.\u201d I was always adamant that my career came first. To think about potentially throwing that away seemed scary.I honestly had no idea how someone could do both. I haven\u2019t worked with a lot of women in general, and the only women who were pregnant or had kids were always working in the office\u2014never the kitchen. But there are tons of women who do this and have families and are successful. Nicole Krasinski. Karen Shields. Dominique Crenn. For me to think that it wasn\u2019t possible, I had to call my own bullshit.But the thing that really changed my mind about having a family was talking to my friend Brandon Rodgers, the executive chef of the Benu restaurant group. He was like, \u201cTrust me, you will become a better chef when you have kids. You will grow personally, which in turn will help you grow professionally.\u201d I stopped seeing my work and my family as two different things. Instead, I started to think of being a parent as a new chapter in my career as a chef. Which I also knew meant that, when I did decide to start a family, I wouldn\u2019t be able to stay at The Charter Oak.The end goal for John and me has always been to work together at our own place. For years, we read cookbooks and menus and talked about hypothetical restaurants we wanted to open. But that\u2019s all it was, just talk. Until one night in October, I was like, we just need to do it\u2014to start a family, and try our own thing\u2014and just see what happens. My age suddenly weighed on me. And I didn\u2019t want to miss the opportunity to start a family because I couldn\u2019t make up my mind, or because the circumstances weren\u2019t perfect. We just needed to make the move. On Christmas Eve, I found out I was pregnant. I figured I\u2019d work at The Charter Oak for as long as I could, and then John and I were on our own.Being pregnant while working, I learned to feel more, I guess, entitled to things. I couldn\u2019t be the first one in the restaurant and the last one out. I had to put my body and myself first, and unfortunately in this industry, you don\u2019t care for yourself that often. You don\u2019t sit down. You don\u2019t sleep. You\u2019re dehydrated. The idea of saying I needed those things made me feel uncomfortable. But after a while, I was fine with it. My body needed it and there was someone else to consider. It empowered me to care for myself.Christopher was very supportive, asking me how I felt and what we could change, little things like not standing as long and working shorter days, eight hours instead of 15. Being pregnant changed things for me in terms of how I approached my work. It made me want to improve the quality of life for my cooks. I became more sympathetic to other employees who had things going on. Before at The Charter Oak, I\u2019d get angry and want stuff done a certain way. There wasn\u2019t an awareness for others.I worked until I was eight months pregnant, before stepping away for the new chef to take over. Now we\u2019re planning our move back to L.A., where our families are, and where we\u2019ll eventually open our own restaurant. In the meantime, I\u2019m on maternity leave (paid for by the state of California) for about six months. John is going to take a little time as well. He needs to decompress. He\u2019s been so engaged for so many years on a specific project. He really does need to take some time to think about what he actually wants to do.It\u2019s not wrong to have the singular, competitive, creative drive like we used to have. But there is a different level of cooking that excites me now: food that is personal, cooking in a way that\u2019s meaningful. For us, that means connecting with our Korean culture. This is big for me because my professional and personal lives have always been two separate things. But now I feel like it\u2019s extremely powerful and rewarding to combine my love for my work and my love for my family. My vision of cooking is no longer just me and a handful of young cooks grinding it out all day.I have this picture in my mind of John and me at our future restaurant. One of us in the office working on some menus or going through invoices; the other in the kitchen prepping. Our kids are sitting in a corner with cousins and grandparents, eating a Korean lunch that we prepared and put our hearts into. The grandparents take all the kids to the park after lunch and we see them at home later. Of course, this is somewhat fantasized. In reality, it\u2019s probably going to be much more hectic, maybe a little dirty and stressful. There might even be some kids screaming or crying. But it\u2019s nice to have a new dream.Explore Bon App\u00e9titChefsRestaurantsFirst PersonRead MoreLifestyleSo Your Friends Had a Kid.
