In her book, Ripe Figs: Recipes and Stories from Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus, you\u2019ll find Khan\u2019s interpretation of the recipe, which she says is great for feeding a crowd at picnics and cookouts. These sandwiches traditionally feature grilled mackerel (always fresh, never canned!), so if you can cook the fish outdoors over an open flame, we highly recommend doing so. Feel free to tweak the ratios of crunchy veg, but the dressing and mint are essential to cut through the mackerel\u2019s intensity. Can\u2019t find fresh mackerel? You can sub in snapper or black bass, but the flavor will be more mild.IngredientsMakes 2Dressing2Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil2Tbsp. fresh lemon juice1Tbsp. pomegranate molasses\u00bdtsp.
