In my household, which is vegetarian, it\u2019s our main source of protein, used in dishes from all cuisines\u2014from a turmeric-accented tofu scramble for tacos to a vegan palak paneer-style dish using pan-fried tofu in place of cheese.\u00a0This recipe is a riff on a Chinese American classic, sesame chicken. Achieving a crispy coating around the tofu is key\u2014it adds to the overall texture of the finished dish. After trying several types of flours and starches, I found that cornstarch provides the ideal level of crunch while retaining some crispiness even after soaking up sauce. Those familiar with sesame chicken might know\u00a0that the \u201csesame\u201d component is sometimes limited to a ceremonial scattering of seeds on top. This version, however, ups the sesame game by incorporating an untraditional but logical addition: tahini! Made of ground sesame seeds, it adds a delicious richness.\u00a0This method of pan-frying tofu is also excellent for those who love salt and pepper tofu: All you need to do is to sprinkle this salt and pepper mix over your crispy tofu: \u00bd tsp. sugar, \u00bd tsp. freshly ground white pepper, \u00bc tsp. ground ginger, \u00bd tsp. five-spice powder, and 2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1\u00bc tsp. Morton kosher salt. \u00a0\u2014Hetty McKinnonAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Morton kosher salt, divided, plus more1Tbsp. plus \u00bc cup grapeseed oil or vegetable oil, divided\u00bctsp. freshly ground black pepper1Tbsp. toasted sesame seedsSteamed white or brown rice (for serving)PreparationStep 1Drain one 14-oz. block extra-firm tofu and pat dry with a kitchen towel. Cut tofu in half horizontally through the equator (like a hamburger bun), then cut into 1\" cubes and pat dry again. Arrange in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet or large plate and set aside.Step 2Cut 1 large head of broccoli (about 1 lb.) into small 1\" florets. If your broccoli has a long stem, peel tough outer skin to remove the lighter fibrous layer, then slice stem \u00bc\" thick. Finely chop 1 scallion and set aside for serving.Step 3To make the sauce, scrape skin from one 1\" piece ginger with a spoon, then grate on a Microplane into a small bowl. Smash and peel 1 garlic clove and grate into bowl with ginger. Add \u00bc cup tamari or soy sauce, 2 Tbsp. light or dark brown sugar or pure maple syrup, 2 Tbsp. tahini, 2 Tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar, 1 Tbsp. toasted sesame oil, 1\u00bd tsp. cornstarch, a pinch of kosher salt, and 3 Tbsp. water and whisk to combine. Set sauce aside.Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 4Sprinkle 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt over tofu and toss to coat. Scatter remaining \u00bc cup cornstarch over tofu a tablespoonful at a time, tossing after each addition and gently pressing into the tofu pieces, until well coated on all sides.Step 5Heat 1 Tbsp. grapeseed oil or vegetable oil in a large nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Add broccoli, season with \u00bd tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bc tsp. Morton kosher salt and \u00bc tsp. freshly ground black pepper, and cook, tossing occasionally, until just tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer broccoli to a plate. Wipe out skillet.Step 6Heat remaining \u00bc cup grapeseed or vegetable oil in same skillet over medium-high. When oil is hot (it will start to shimmer), reduce heat to medium and add tofu in a single layer (work in batches if needed). Cook, turning every 3\u20134 minutes, until golden brown all over, 10\u201312 minutes total. Transfer to a clean kitchen towel or paper towels and let drain.Step 7Pour out any remaining oil in pan and wipe out. Return pan to medium heat. Whisk reserved sauce if it has separated, then pour into pan and cook until thickened and bubbling, about 20 seconds. Immediately remove pan from heat and add broccoli and tofu; toss to coat.Step 8Top tofu and broccoli with 1 Tbsp. toasted sesame seeds and reserved scallions. Serve with steamed white or brown rice.\u00a0Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronHow would you rate Sesame Tofu With Broccoli?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (55)Back to TopTriangleAdded more veggies - purple cabbage and mushrooms to clean out the fridge, didn't have cornstarch so I used flour and it worked well! Yummy dish, will be making again for a vegetable packed meal!AnonymousWashington, DC3/22/2022I was disappointed after reading the reviews.  I didn't find this recipe to be just average in flavor.  I could readily notice the cornstarch in the taste of the sauce too.  This isn't one I'll make again.  n2gardeningFairfax, VA2/16/2022LOVED THIS! I added bok choy and sugar snap peas about 90 seconds before the broccoli was done and tossed through hokkien noodles at the end (with a little bit of water to loosen to sauce so it would coat them). I enjoyed the sauce as written, but can see what other commenters are saying about the salt. Next time I'd probably oven bake the tofu just to cut down the oil, but this will be in regular rotation!AnonymousSeattle, WA2/14/2022I really liked this, especially the sauce, which I will use for other vegetable stir fries. I followed the recipe pretty closely, but I used both broccoli and sugar snaps, I missed the corn starch the sauce but it was quite thick without it. I probably used more cornstarch on the tofu and it came out very crispy. I microwaved leftovers but the tofu wasn't crispy anymore. Still, it was just fine for lunch the next day.Leslie CAshland, OR2/5/2022Very good, very easy as written.  Air frying the crispy tofu worked great and cleaner than pan frying.  Flavor very rich and good.  Used lo sodium Tamari and only 3/4tbsp Mortons, and no more added, and very nicely flavored.   Easy to customize to any veggies you like.  Green beans, snow peas, bell peppers were great too (red adds a flash of color).  Looks great when plated.RAEIllinois1/28/2022I make this recipe all the time; my husband and I love it.\n\nI *do* dramatically reduce the salt, use low-sodium tamari, and add a tiny squeeze of chili-garlic sauce to the sauce, but otherwise make exactly as written.\n\nHighly recommend using a brand of tofu that really is extra-firm, so the cubes don\u2019t fall apart as you cook them, and drying the tofu thoroughly so it crisps up nicely.\n\nDelish!Anonymous1/28/2022Delicious! (I think) I\u2019m getting over COVID and cannot smell or taste. Usually I would use the recipe as my guide and adjust as I go, but this time I followed the recipe exactly. My family said they loved it but wanted more sauce. I did double the tofu and veggies and forgot to double the sauce. I can\u2019t wait to make it again when I can enjoy it. CarrieDallas, TX1/25/2022This one is a winner. The tahini was a good addition. Anonymous1/25/2022It's all about the sauce, and this sauce is not good.  Too much salt and flavor not great.AnonymousDetroit, MI1/22/2022Great!  I've made this recipe several times and made some alterations.  Firm tofu-just allow more time to completely   drain/press the tofu dry, half chunky peanut butter and half tahini with a little hot sauce, sugar-snap peas or asparagus instead of broccoli.  Sprinkle with crisp won-ton strips and you're good to go.macaroni rascalUpper Southampton, PA1/20/2022amazing!!! my tofu stuck to the pan a lot but I'm pretty sure it's my pan's fault. Also, I roasted the broccoli in the oven to save time and it turned out good. \nSo flavorful and tasty! I had it with rice but I would've eaten it by itself too.AnonymousEdinburgh, Scotland1/18/2022I made this with just the tofu and my whole family enjoyed it very much! Amazing recipe\ud83e\udd0cAnonymousSweden1/12/2022This got good reviews!  I doubled the sauce because I love sauce but, truly, that was unnecessary. I did leave out all additional salt based on other reviews and didn't have a problem with saltiness. Would be good with other vegetables as well. Will make again!nilssons1/11/2022Delicious snd easy! Agree with the other reviewer about the tahini - that\u2019s the ingredient that takes the sauce over the top. Would work with any protein and vegetable combo. Added some crushed red pepper for some kick. Definitely going into regular rotation!LCBoulder1/8/2022The tahini makes the sauce extraordinary. I will use the saute method for tofu in other recipes. Good one all around!
