Thanks to the Caf\u00e9 line of appliances, you can build a creative kitchen that not only performs, but one that jives with your vibe.By Caf\u00e9 AppliancesPhotography by PAOLA + MURRAYApril 9, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailA tailor-made kitchen means a look and feel that\u2019s personalized, speaks to your entertaining style, and echoes your home decor. Bon App\u00e9tit recently teamed up with Caf\u00e9 Appliances to makeover our kitchen and entertaining space. See the swanky new look and get inspired to remake your own space, too.Add a finishing touchSure, you want your appliances to be top performers, but that doesn\u2019t mean they need to look utilitarian or clunky. The Caf\u00e9 Customizable Professional Collection lets you choose the look\u2014in either Matte Black, Matte White, or Stainless. You can even mix and match\u2014with, say, a Matte Black Double Convection Wall Oven and Range with a Matte White French Door Refrigerator to lighten the look. For a streamlined effect, we went for Matte Black appliances with Brushed Stainless hardware in our kitchen.Accessorize with abandonJust like you zhuzh up your outfits with accessories, why not add a little bling to your appliances with custom-colored knobs and handles. Choose from four different finishes from the Caf\u00e9 line\u2014Brushed Stainless, Brushed Black, Brushed Bronze, or Brushed Copper. The beauty is, you can add your own brand of swag by switching them up or going monochrome. We decked out our Bon App\u00e9tit kitchen appliances with all-over Brushed Stainless hardware. Each finish comes with a Brushed Copper accent on the handles for that little something extra.Customize your cooktopIf you have the option to saut\u00e9 in style or stick with a humdrum cooktop, you know you\u2019d choose style\u2014and substance. Caf\u00e9 Cooktops not only match your cooking style, but they can also echo your personality, thanks to customizable hardware finishes and a host of features. Maybe you\u2019re the tech-savvy sort who gravitates toward an all-gray Touch Control Induction model, complete with app-controlled gourmet guided cooking. Or, perhaps you\u2019re more traditional (yet no less chic) like our Bon App\u00e9tit chefs and prefer a Gas Cooktop with knob controls in a Brushed Stainless finish.Store Wine in StyleA built-in wine fridge is an entertainer\u2019s dream machine. Not only does it stash your bottles smartly (they often come with temperature settings for the different varieties), but also sharply. Sleek finishes like stainless-steel and features such as sliding wood shelf fronts coordinate with surrounding cabinetry and look super stylish. So, even if you\u2019re a rookie, a stellar looking storage system is vinophile approved.Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
