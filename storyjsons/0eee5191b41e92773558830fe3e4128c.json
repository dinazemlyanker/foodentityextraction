Across the country, restaurant critics, writers, and local food lovers have been pulling together extensive lists highlighting Black-owned businesses in their respective cities. We wanted to share what they\u2019re creating, from Google spreadsheets with updates on take-out/delivery options and GoFundMe links to websites that have long been celebrating Black-owned businesses and owners. We will continue to update this page as more resources become available, and encourage you to use these resources now, and always. Let us know if you come across anything that would be helpful to add to this growing list by emailing us at staff.bonappetit@gmail.com with the subject line \u201cBlack-owned businesses.\u201dFrom left to right: Everett and Jones BBQ in Oakland, Yonnie Hagos and Ajay Relan of Hilltop Coffee and Kitchen in L.A., Miss Ollie's in Oakland.\nPhotos by RYAN WALKER-HARTSHORN, Jennifer Johnson, and RYAN WALKER-HARTSHORNWESTThe Bay Area- Google spreadsheet of coffee shops, bakeries, and restaurants open for take-out and delivery in the Bay Area, with information on merch, gift cards, GoFundMe pages, and more.
