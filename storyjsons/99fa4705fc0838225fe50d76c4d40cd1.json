My black plastic cutting boards are for everyday cooking tasks like prepping chicken breasts and chopping hearty greens. Easy to maintain and dark enough to conceal stains and scratch marks, they\u2019re my utilitarian workhorses. Then there are my wooden cutting boards, which are pretty but high-maintenance. They require some babying to keep them supple and looking new, so I either use those as countertop decor or tuck them away unless I\u2019m hosting.But a cutting board that\u2019s low-maintenance and functional? I didn\u2019t think it existed\u2014until I got my Fredericks and Mae confetti cutting board, which has the durability of my everyday black boards, the beauty of my wooden ones, and a lot more personality than both.Fredericks & Mae Cutting Board$95 at Bon App\u00e9tit Market$100 at Coming Soon New YorkIt comes in a variety of color combos like yellow and blue, multicolored, and black and white. The busy confetti-like flecked patterns offer even more visual camouflage than my black boards do, disguising discoloration and knife scratches. That type of magic isn\u2019t possible with wooden cutting boards, where wear and tear is usually obvious. The large (11\" x 16\") Fredericks and Mae cutting board is also heavy, so it doesn\u2019t slip and slide around while I\u2019m using it, even without a damp cloth underneath. Because it\u2019s so gorgeous, whenever I cut anything on it\u2014whether it be a juicy steak, seasonal galette, or a block of cheese\u2014I just serve it straight on the cutting board. And yes, I can confirm it has the power to make any dish ready for social media prime time.Did I mention it\u2019s made from recycled materials? Those confetti specks are leftover scraps from solid color cutting boards. It definitely has a higher price point than your average plastic board, but investing in sustainability, to me, is worth it\u2014especially for a piece of kitchen equipment that nails both form and function.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make.
