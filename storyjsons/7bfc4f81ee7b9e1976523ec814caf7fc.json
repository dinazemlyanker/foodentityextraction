When she first lived alone, at 14 years old, she stuck to instant ramen, boxed mac and cheese, and egg-in-a-hole toasts. But as an adult, sharing food with her friends and loved ones has become one of her favorite things, and her close friend and personal chef, Pilar Valdes, is a big reason why. The pair met in the midst of major life transitions, and they found solace and inspiration together in the kitchen. Now their professional and personal relationship has culminated in a new cookbook, Rebel Homemaker: Food, Family and Life, a collection of recipes and stories from Barrymore and Valdes. Read all about it (or listen to their appearance on our podcast, Food People, below.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.How did you two meet?Drew Barrymore: I want to hear Pilar\u2019s perspective, just out of curiosity, Even though I feel like I know what she\u2019s going to say. I was living in a rental apartment, I was getting divorced, I was really lost and extremely, honestly, emotional and raw and vulnerable and unhappy. And when all your plans blow up in your face, especially when there are kids involved, those are the highest stakes of your life. And so that\u2019s where I was at when I met Pilar.Pilar Valdes: Drew always refers to that time in her life as a \u201cgreat transition,\u201d on multiple levels. And I think I was also going through a very big transition. I have a catering company called Kickshaw Cookery, and a few years prior, my business partner left for Texas to be closer to family. At the time I was kind of reeling a little bit under the weight of running the business on my own. And I\u2019ve always worked best in community, so I told myself, \u201cI\u2019m gonna pause and step back a little.\u201dIt was around that time, when I was trying to figure out what to do with my cooking, when one day I woke up to an email\u2014I think it was like 4:30 in the morning, which is usually when I get up for my kitchen shifts anyway. The subject line was, you know, \u201cChef with Drew Barrymore.\u201d And I literally thought I was being punked. But, sure enough, you were looking for [a personal chef], you were moving to New York, and I was just like, \u201cThis is bananas and so outside of what I even would have been considering. But I\u2019m just gonna say yes. Let\u2019s just see where it goes.\u201dHow do you two cook together?Valdes: Drew has one of the most impressive cookbook collections I\u2019ve ever seen, so we will literally just lay out the cookbooks on the kitchen island, and all they\u2019re dog-eared, and we\u2019ll flip through them, taking inspiration from different recipes, being like, \u201cOh,\u201d we\u2019ll say, \u201cmaybe we can do a fully Thai menu today.\u201d Or we\u2019ll find something like an Ina Garten dessert and decide to make it for the kids.Barrymoore: I love food from around the world and learning about food from around the world. I also love experimenting, and so it\u2019s been so fun to come to Pilar and say, \u201cWhat if we tried this? What if we did that? I\u2019ve always loved this combination.\u201d And through her, I felt like I could spread my curiosity and culinary wings, and it\u2019s just not something I would have done by myself or on my own. I think I\u2019m someone who, for better or worse, doesn\u2019t have the capacity to sit around and be content. I\u2019m always gonna want to carry something to the next level.Valdes: One of the things I think folks should know about you is that you have an incredible palate.Barrymoore: Really?Valdes: And an incredibly wide-ranging palate. So as a chef, that\u2019s a really, really fun thing to cater toward because it sort of gives you room to play and try new things all the time. And so it was always like this really wonderful challenge.When and how did you know you wanted to write a cookbook?Valdes: I feel like Drew threw out the idea of a cookbook fairly early on after I\u2019d met her. But at the time it was just this little spark of an idea. Drew does that occasionally. She\u2019ll have a little dream that she\u2019ll sprinkle here and there and kind of walk away and sort of see how it settles.Barrymoore: And after everything we cooked, and especially if we liked it, I\u2019d ask Pilar, \u201cDid you write it down? Did you write everything down, Pilar?\u201dValdes: I\u2019d be like, \u201cUh, no.\u201d I\u2019m a very intuitive cook, so maybe I would write down the name of whatever I made. But sometimes, you\u2019re using whatever you have on hand, you\u2019re being flexible to what\u2019s available in the kitchen you\u2019re in, and you\u2019re swapping things out here and there. But Drew really started to drill it in me to get into the habit of keeping track of things to prepare for the potential of a writing opportunity.Why write a cookbook now?Barrymoore: Pilar and I were already kind of rubber-hits-the-road working on The Drew Barrymore Show and figuring out what we wanted to do culinarily speaking with the series. So when the opportunity to write the book came in our laps, we were like, \u201cAll right, we can do this too.\u201d But we were in the height of the pandemic and it got very daunting and overwhelming, very fast.Valdes: I mean, seriously. Leave it to Drew to launch a show and a cookbook in the middle of the pandemic. They were definitely intense times, especially because this is our first go at a cookbook, and to do that when we couldn\u2019t even be in the same room as a lot of the team was a little daunting.Barrymoore: I\u2019d been offered to do a few cookbooks over the years, and I always said, \u201cOh, no. I would not be the person you want for this endeavor.\u201d I felt (a), ill-equipped, (b), like I would be creating imposter syndrome for myself, and (c), worst of all, like I didn\u2019t want to be some lifestyle expert who is polished on the cover of books. I believe in people when they really are who they are, and to me, chefs are very authentic people. I just did not feel I belonged in that world.So when I met Pilar and this ember turned into a flame and the opportunity came around again, it was very different for me that time. We had been in the kitchen for a few years at that point. I had a point of view. I thought it would be amazing to document this. Obviously, I must have subconsciously known that the whole time because we did document it.Valdes: That\u2019s also the thing about the book: There\u2019s so much there. We really had to narrow down the recipes, but I think what we chose were mainly recipes from this home.Barrymoore: They\u2019re what we make. That\u2019s true.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCulturePodcastsRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
