If you sign up for our newsletter, you\u2019ll get her letter before everyone else.When you think about your favorite cookies, what comes to mind? I feel like I have at least three: a cozy-coffee-shop cookie (Culture Espresso\u2019s chocolate chip, served-hot), overachiever help-me-win-the-cookie-swap cookie (tricolores), and fancy cafe cookie (T\u00e9 Company\u2019s perfect pineapple linzer torte).But in my heart, when I think about my favorite cookies, bar none, they\u2019re always the ones that bring me back to childhood\u2014the Danish butter cookies in that royal blue tin, the big sugar cookies with royal icing and colored sprinkles that I\u2019d get from the bakery in my hometown as a treat, the oatmeal chocolate chip ones I\u2019d make with my mom (and, true to kid form, would sneak plenty of batter from along the way).Want this letter before it hits the website?\u00a0Sign up for our newsletter!Sarah Jampel's buttery, jam-filled tahini linzer torte bars.\nPhotograph by Laura Murray, food styling by Sue LiWhich is why I am so excited that the\u00a0holiday cookie package\u00a0in this year\u2019s Holiday Issue (subscribe here!) is all about cookie nostalgia. Our recipe developers looked back at the cookies they loved the most growing up and upgraded them for our 2020 lives: more sprinkles, more chocolate, more nuts, more pizzazz. They range from fudgy bittersweet pizzettes and gingery marranitos enfiestados to a super-fun Fig Newton upgrade with tahini and beautiful brown butter and pistachio sables, and I think I love them all.I\u2019d love to hear what cookies you\u2019re baking or ordering or hoping to be sent this year, and whether that\u2019s tradition for you or something new you\u2019re trying this holiday season.
