Beat \u00be cup (packed; 150 g) light brown sugar and \u00bd cup (1 stick) room-temperature unsalted butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or a large bowl if using a hand mixer) on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Scrape sides and bottom of bowl with a rubber spatula and beat again to combine. Add 1 large egg and 1 tsp. dark rum or vanilla extract and beat until combined and fluffy.Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 2Whisk 1\u00bc cups (156 g) all-purpose flour, 1 cup sweetened shredded coconut, 1 tsp. baking soda, and 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt in a medium bowl to combine.Step 3Add dry ingredients to brown sugar mixture all at once and mix on low speed until well combined. Scrape sides and bottom of bowl with spatula and beat again to incorporate.Step 4Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Using cookie scoop, scoop 12 heaping rounds onto prepared baking sheets, spacing about 2\" apart. (If you don\u2019t have a #40 scoop, make each cookie about 2 Tbsp.)Step 5Bake cookies, rotating front to back and top to bottom after 5 minutes, until edges are golden and solid but centers are still a little underbaked, 11\u201313 minutes.Step 6Remove cookies from oven and smack baking sheet hard on counter a couple of times\u2014be firm! This will cause the cookies to collapse in the center and keep them chewy.Step 7Let cookies cool on baking sheets, then gently transfer all of the cookies to 1 baking sheet, arranging in a single layer. Chill cookies in the freezer until cold and firm, about 15 minutes.Step 8While cookies are chilling, let 1 pint vanilla or coconut ice cream sit on counter at room temperature until pliable (but before it\u2019s melted), 10\u201315 minutes.Step 9Scoop a heaping \u00bc cup ice cream onto bottoms of 6 cookies. Top with remaining 6 cookies, bottoms facing down. Gently press sandwiches together until ice cream is even and almost at the edge all the way around.Step 10Chill ice cream sandwiches in the freezer until firm and set up, at least 10 minutes.Chocolate ShellStep 11Pour 2 cups water into a medium saucepan and set a medium heatproof bowl on top of pan. Bring water to a simmer over medium-high heat.Step 12Combine 2 cups bittersweet chocolate chips, \u00bc cup refined coconut oil, and \u00bd tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bc tsp. Morton kosher salt in bowl and heat, stirring occasionally with a clean spatula, until chips are melted and combined. Remove from heat and keep chocolate shell mixture warm over water. (You can also melt chocolate shell mixture in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave at medium-high power in 20-second increments.)Step 13Remove cookies from freezer and, working one at a time, dip half of each sandwich in chocolate shell. (Store any extra chocolate shell in the refrigerator\u2014it keeps almost indefinitely and can be reheated for ice cream sundaes or as dip for fruit, cookies, and even potato chips.) Place sandwiches back on baking sheet and sprinkle with flaky sea salt as you go. Chill in freezer until set before serving, at least 15 minutes.Do ahead: Ice cream sandwiches can be made 1 month ahead. Transfer to an airtight container, stacking with sheets of parchment paper between each layer, and freeze.Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronHow would you rate Coconut Ice Cream Sandwiches With Salty Chocolate Shell?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (5)Back to TopTriangleThese were DELICIOUS! The cookies turn out huge, however, and we found that the sandwiches were way too big for one person to eat. Next time will make smaller cookies.CatherineSan Francisco12/5/2021Succulent cookies! My batter was very  soft and needed a few minutes chilling before shaping and baking.  Make sure ice cream (or vegan ice cream) reaches close to the edge of the two cookies before dipping. \nI used Miyokos vegan butter. The salty tang compliments the sweet perfectly! I will be making these for company!Pushkin23Albany, NY7/16/2021I had unsweetened coconut so I added some agave nectar which provided needed sweetness.  I used a scant tablespoon of dough for each cookie and ended up with 22 cookies or 11 sandwiches. I followed all the directions including dipping the frozen cookies into the chocolate. When the frozen bars hit the hot chocolate, eventually drops of ice cream landed in the chocolate. \nAnd the melted chocolate did what melted chocolate \ndoes\u2026 it seized.  I used a knife and managed to spread \nthe chocolate on half of each sandwich. For some\nreason the chocolate didn\u2019t harden but it did harden on the ice cream sandwiches made with store bought cookies. This is my first time using homemade cookies for this project and I likely will not do it again. For the amount of work the end result was just okay. However, I\u2019m sure my guests will enjoy them. Bite by EveChicago 7/4/2021How can I substitute dried coconut for the sweetened shredded coconut? My husband is extremely sensitive to the sulfites in sweetened coconut so I need a substitute workaround. What do you suggest?AnonymousEtna, Wtoming7/1/2021Flavors were good! The cookies are the best part here. Here are my notes if I make them again:\n- these cookies are GIANT, I think I would go fairly smaller and aim to get 8 sandwiches instead of six \n- You probably want more than a pint of ice cream, I used a pint but there isn't a ton of ice cream in these\n- CHILL longer than what is suggested above. You want everything to be nice and cold before moving on to the next step HannaVirginia6/30/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titCookieDessertIce CreamFrozen DessertAmericanCoconutFruitChocolateOther IngredientsSummerBakingBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
