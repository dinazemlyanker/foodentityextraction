You know the ones. Kurokawa\u2019s gained quite a following for her quirky, yet minimal and delicate aesthetic\u2014apple-caramel cakes draped with thin sheets of shaved apple, frosted blue eyeballs dotting pineapple upside-down cakes. But even her simplest ones, like strawberry shortcakes and cocoa-dusted chocolate cakes, hold their own among the borough\u2019s big names in baking. (However, if cakes aren\u2019t your thing, crumbly linzer cookies swiped with raspberry jam, jagged black pepper-scallion scones, and ginger-cinnamon braids paired with faintly smoky hojicha still hit the sweet spot.)THE VIBE IS: relaxed, with occasional freneticism if a handful of architects or stroller-pushing locals swing by. \u201cIntimate\u201d is how a broker might describe the space. Inside, there are only two wooden chairs, a narrow counter by the window for standing, and three leather ottomans outside, so there\u2019s not a lot of room to spread. The dark wood display, cobbled together furniture, and pale hues evoke both your parent\u2019s basement and a stylish cafe in Tokyo\u2019s old Asakusa neighborhood.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Monday to Friday, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., and closed on the weekends. Kurokawa and her baked goods stick to a militaristic schedule. Breakfast rolls out between 9 to 11 a.m. Then cookies and cream puffs start sliding into the shelves right around 11:30 a.m. But the cakes don\u2019t debut until around 2 p.m., so plan accordingly.\u2014Elyse InamineAlex LauAlex LauWE ALSO LOVEVoyager EspressoThe futuristic Aussie cafe hidden in a Lower Manhattan subway stationOkonomiJapanese breakfast and ramen, all in one perfect Williamsburg spotMomofuku KoHang out with chefs at David Chang\u2019s continually groundbreaking spot in the East VillageExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
