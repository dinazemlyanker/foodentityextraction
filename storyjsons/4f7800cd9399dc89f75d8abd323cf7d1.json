And if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve noticed after plenty of time spent around OPGs, it\u2019s that people have some goofy-ass ideas about what kinds of tools are necessary to make grilling happen. A familiar scenario: Beaming Grill Dad hauls a brushed metal attach\u00e9 case that looks like it contains nuclear launch codes out of the garage and opens it proudly to reveal a number of puzzling implements, likelier medieval torture devices than grill tools. \u201cPretty sweet, huh?\u201d Grill Dad whispers smugly. At which point I fight the urge to raise my palm to my forehead, thank Grill Dad, and wait until he begins mansplaining about craft beers to go rummaging around in his kitchen for the tools I actually need.Here\u2019s the funny thing about the tools you need to cook food outdoors: They\u2019re exactly the same as the ones you use for cooking food indoors. I have never in my life met a purpose-built set of grill tools that performed better than the workhorses that I already keep in my kitchen\u2014in fact, most of the time they perform way worse. This is all to say that, if you\u2018re in the market for grill tools, you should really check the caddy next to your stove, because you probably already own them\u2014and if you don\u2019t, you need to buy these ASAP.The one tongs to rule them all.\nNikole HerriottTongsWhy is it that every pair of tongs marketed as grill-specific seems to be fully and fundamentally dysfunctional? There are the ones that are way too long, making it extremely hard to move anything around on the grill with any kind of dexterity. There are the ones that, instead of being joined at the base with a simple, time-tested spring-based closure, are comprised of one long, thick piece of bent metal, which makes opening and closing them feel like using one of those weird hand exercisers. And then there are the ones that have bizarre and novel grippers at the ends\u2014weird tiny teeth, serrated triangles, laser-cut mini-spatulas bearing sports team logos\u2014that always seem to either a) mangle the food you\u2019re trying to pick up or b) fail to pick up any food at all. They all suck.You know what don\u2019t suck? Regular sturdy stainless steel kitchen tongs. Just as nobody has managed to make a better mousetrap, no amount of added bells, whistles, or teak handles can make for a better steak-and-hot-dog-picker-upper. I like to keep two pairs of 12-inch tongs by the grill in case I need to flip something big and ungainly like a whole spatchcocked chicken. And if you\u2019re really that anxious about getting your hands too close to the fire, spring for the longer 16-inch version. The best part? THEY ARE ONLY $5.Buy It: Winco 12-Inch Coiled Spring Stainless Steel Utility Tongs, $5 on Amazon.I <3 fish spatulas.\nZach DesartSpatulaWhy would I need a spatula as long as a shovel, so heavy that I need two hands to use it? Why would I need a spatula that has perhaps the most inconveniently-placed bottle opener of all time attached to the end? Why would I need a spatula with a random serrated edge that is not really sharp enough to cut into a steak but is definitely sharp enough to cut my hand while I\u2019m putting it away in the dark and send me to the urgent care for several stitches? The world may never know.But this I know: A fish spatula is the best grill spatula you will ever use, period. It has a low-profile edge that is perfect for getting under stuck-on burgers. It has a tight turning radius, allowing you to quickly and nimbly flip said burgers. And it is small enough that you can easily rest it on a plate or a tray without it falling off and getting covered in dirt or gravel or straw or whatever lives on the ground near your grill. Will you have to get slightly closer to the food you\u2019re grilling than you are used to? Possibly. But it builds character! Also: wear oven mitts! And how much will one of these bad boys set you back? ABOUT SIX BUCKS!Buy It: Winco 6.5-Inch Blade Fish Spatula, $6 on Amazon.No grill brush? No problem. Balled up aluminum foil and tongs will work juuuuust fine.\nPhoto by Alex LauGrill Dad, if you\u2019re reading this, perhaps you\u2019re wondering, What about the two foot-long sharp fork thing? Or the random basting brush with the silicone bristles?? To this I ask you: Have you actually even used those things? I. Didn\u2019t. Think. SO. What about a grill brush??? Well, fine, you kind of need a grill brush. But you can also just use a balled-up piece of aluminum foil and those tongs to clean your grill grates in a pinch. But also: Go ahead and buy a grill brush\u2014but make sure it's sturdy, with wire bristles. You deserve it.No, you don't need mini tools for a mini grill:With a Mini Grill, the World is Your CookoutBuy a mini grill, fulfill all of your summer hot dog fantasies.
