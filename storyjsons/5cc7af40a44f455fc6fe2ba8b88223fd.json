Next time I will use hot pickled jalape\u00f1os. The dressing for the squash was so good I\u2019ll use it this summer on grilled zucchini. Sharon BBakersfield, CA2/20/2022Our cooking club tried this recepi and had this to say, a little spicy would not do the jalapenos, cut down on the size of cheese; too spicy for some of our members, \"cheese on the jalapeno was perfect\", did not like the texture of the cheese, maybe a thinner cut, very good-a bit spicky, would skip the jalapeno juice.  Liz Peterson3354910/31/2021Update to my last review: Made this a second time, cooking squash, zucchini and buns on the grill. This time added mayo mixed with chopped chipotle chilies \u2014 new favorite dish!PEGGYBTustin, Ca 9/20/2021perfect week night meal! I personally wasn't a fan of the summer squah, but the halmoumi with the basil and jalapenos were divine. Will definitely make again :) Veronica Montreal9/3/2021Amazing recipe!! Loved the way it uses summer produce. Made a homemade aioli and added Jalepenos in the silos instead of pickling them and was so delicious. Highly recommend!AnonymousMontreal8/28/2021Delicious and easy! We also added a bit of mayo but otherwise made exactly as is and loved every bite!PeggyBTustin8/10/2021Great recipe! The dressing was great on the zucchini and the halloumi was a delicious choice of cheese.  Served with pickled jalape\u00f1os and a sriracha mayonnaise I made. Served with corn on the cob and a fresh from the garden tomato salad.GoldenmomAttleboro, MA8/10/2021This recipe is delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and made a spicy mayo/greek yogurt to serve on the side - also made my own pickled jalapenos, which were so good and easy. My dinner guests raved about the sandwiches, which are hearty and satisfying but not too filling. Sprout22Somerville, MA8/2/2021This burger is amazing, I was skeptical about the dressing and mix of flavors but it was perfect and, in my opinion, added that zing. We used mayo and because we ran out of plain mayo, I had mine with mayo/ketchup burger sauce. I may try with a bit more heat next time, perhaps fresh grilled jalapenos alongside the squash. Huge hit with the family. AnonymousWashington, DC7/29/2021this recipe is delicious and best of all, fast. i made a spicy mayo to go on them and honestly didn't feel like it was that necessary (i used trader joe's brioche buns that weren't dry at all). highly recommend this one for a wholesome weeknight dinner or bbq with friends.annaliseLos Angeles, CA7/23/2021This burger is a lovely way to add more vegetarian meals to your rotation.  The recipe only needed one pan and was super easy.  The burgers tasted good with the combination of flavors.  I think the taste of basil really added to the cheese and bread.  I will definitely make this often.JeanboiseBoise, Idaho7/22/2021This is the perfect easy summer weeknight meal. I was skeptical of the marinade but oh my is it tasty. I can\u2019t eat jalape\u00f1os so I used some dill pickle juice instead and it was excellent. Add some tomato and Mayo on the buns for some extra flavor to really round it out. LaurenPortland, OR7/19/2021This was amazing! We are making it again later this week \u2014 that\u2019s how good it was! The perfect balance of flavors.  We used brioche buns and I cannot imagine it any other way! Just a perfect supper sandwich: salt, fat, acid, (slight) heat.  The pickled jalape\u00f1os made it so don\u2019t skip those. CCBaltimore Md 7/19/2021Absolutely delicious! I was a bit skeptical if this would all come together, but this was very very tasty. Perfect for summer when you want something fresh and easy. The only thing is that it was a tad bit dry, so I would recommend adding a little bit of mayo on one of the buns. This will definitely stay in my rotation for vegetarian recipes!KatieVancouver, Canada7/14/2021These Were Delicious!\n\nDid you renew your subscription?AnonymousToronto7/12/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titBurgerVeggie BurgerSummer SquashSquashVegetableHalloumiCheeseSummerQuickEasyWeeknight MealsOne-Pot MealsMainNut-FreeVegetarianSearDinnerRecipes you want to make.
