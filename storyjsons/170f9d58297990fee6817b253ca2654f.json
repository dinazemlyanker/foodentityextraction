I want to tell them, \u201cIn MY day, there were no acerola juice shots at Trader Joe\u2019s. I had to subsist on hash brown patties!\u201d Instead, I veer my cart away as quickly as possible because I\u2019m terrified of dorm germs.This summer, I was about to publish a Trader Joe\u2019s roundup photographed on my plush, unmowed grass, when [waves around the room, generally] happened and no one needed this kind of oblivious silliness. But things keep getting worse, don\u2019t they? And we need a distraction of no consequence. Here we are.Not pictured below but a PSA: I couldn\u2019t find them this month, but GET THE SPRINKLE SANDWICH COOKIES! Butter bombs of vanilla-flavored frosting delight! As well as the fermented pickled jalape\u00f1os, which are so spicy. And the ube mochi pancake mix! Gray-purple space Frisbees that have a fun spongy texture and sweet potato flavor.Photo by Alex BeggsNot-chip chipsJalape\u00f1o Seasoned Corn and Rice PuffsBEST NEW PRODUCT OF FALL 2020. Little half-circles of puff, like coiled-up roly-polies, are covered in seasoning that\u2019s spicy, a tad sweet, and cheese-like without the cheese. The ideal drinking snack, stress-eating snack, or stress-drinking snack. Those are the only categories of snack I have right now, sorry. The texture is crispy, but it explodes and disintegrates immediately, similar to a Cheetos Puff, which means you want MORE, MORE, MORE (the term for this is vanishing caloric density)!Crispy Banana RibbonsMore sweet than salty, these candy chips have a thin and snappy texture, but they\u2019re too breakable for dipping. The TJ plantain chips are better.Photo by Alex BeggsCorn thingsCorn Cookie Baking MixAnother one of TJ\u2019s best new products lately is this understated canister of cookie mix. The cookies are soft, super corny, and have that little cornmeal crunch. They remind me of Milk Bar\u2019s famous corn cookies without the extra stick of butter. I froze half of my dough balls in case I ever feel like sharing. Plus, they\u2019re so quick and easy to make. Add butter and egg, and it\u2019ll all turn out in the end.Mini Cornbread BiscottiIf you like dry, hardened cornbread someone named Bill left out on the counter overnight without properly wrapping it, this is for YOU! And you can have them all. Take mine. It\u2019s just way too sweet, which is a bummer, because I thought \u201csoup biscotti\u201d would be a cool new thing. Like, imagine dipping these guys into Trader Joe\u2019s best soup\u2014roasted red pepper! However, that would be gross, like dipping cookies into salsa.Photo by Alex BeggsSnacks in square packagesPB&J Snack DuoSomeone call Tim Cook or whoever actually has a hand in the future of technology because these are innovation. Why has no one thought of this before? Wafer cookies filled with peanut butter\u2014crisp pastry that yields to dissolving peanut butter cream\u2014that you dunk in raspberry jam. They\u2019re what some may call \u201cwhat we need right now.\u201d Which is more junk food. My niece Leah stuck the wafer into the sticky, gooey jam and sucked all of the jam off before going for a second dip. \u201cBITE IT, LADY!\u201d I shouted from the high chair sidelines. She laughed and showed me her tiny fangs and sucked the jam until the wafer turned to mush. \u201cOne day I\u2019ll tell you about these times,\u201d I whispered into her unknowing, jam-covered ears.Organic Granola BitesAlso for children and adults who need not be judged, these are little balls of granola bound by sugar that tiny humans can eat in their car seats without leaving too much debris. Have you ever seen a car seat after a kid ate Goldfish? You will never, ever vacuum those cheese crumbs away. Hey kid, have some granola bites.No Bake Nut Butter Bar MixWell, you gotta use nearly an entire tub of almond butter (~$4) and half a bear of honey (~$3) to make these, which makes them $10 bars, but then I guess you cut them into 16 bars so it\u2019s still cheaper than store-bought bars with mountain ranges on them. And WOW, these surprised me. Pieces of crispy puffed rice give them a Krackel quality, and all of the almond butter and flour makes them extremely filling and slightly gooey. They\u2019re delicious and keep for ages in the fridge (the rice does soften after a few days, though). Would buy again, which I don\u2019t say very often, because it\u2019s hard to gain my trust.This Coconut Brings Chocolate on a Date BarsI hear you like \u201cnot too sweet,\u201d well, these dense and sticky bars are for you. Bitter chocolate balances the sugary dates, but bars like this make me feel like I\u2019m eating government-issued nutrition patties doled out after the Grand Canyon swallows itself up and we\u2019re all sitting around a campfire fueled by rejected absentee ballots wondering what to do now.Photo by Alex BeggsImpostor chipsOrganic Nacho Cheese Flavored Corn Tortilla ChipsThese faux Doritos have the cheese powder bit NAILED, but the chip itself has that made-too-healthy stale quality. As a certified chip expert (let me have this), I can confidently say that these need more technology (and maybe more fry oil) to go full Dorito. But if you can get down with sorta stale tasting chips because \u201cthey\u2019re organic\u201d\u2014okay! Have at \u2019em.Sea Salted Saddle Potato CrispsNow these faux Pringles are astonishing. Did you know that, while classic Lay\u2019s are thin slices of potato, Pringles are made of dehydrated potato flakes? Again, chip expert talking. The potato flakes give them that thick-yet-dissolvable quality. These are an award-worthy dupe, if there were awards for shameless snack copycatting.Photo by Alex BeggsExciting crackersOrganic Garlic Naan CrackersThese mini naans are oh-so-cute and, wow, buttery. They\u2019re sturdy and good for dipping in hummus or eating while standing in the kitchen thinking about what snack you\u2019d like to have after this pre-snack. Your mouth will steam with garlic fumes. YUM.Everything But The Gluten CrackersSay you\u2019re not able to eat wheat flour. These could be your cracker. They\u2019re hardy and seedy and just a whiff musty. I\u2019ll stick to my onion-flavored MARY\u2019S GONE CRACKERS for now, thanks.Photo by Alex Beggs2 talls and a smallPumpkin Spice Protein SmoothieWhen I twisted the cap off, orange dried pumpkin spice flecks flew off and seasoned my floor with their festive flair. If I were under the delusion that my body needed more protein, I\u2019d happily purchase this to fulfill that invented need. The spice is subtle; it\u2019s mostly milky. I feel my biceps tingling already!Acerola Juice ShotMy friend Bryan says the frozen acerola pur\u00e9e is \u201cactually very good,\u201d and I believe him, because this juice shot is tart and sour, like a green strawberry. It\u2019s also trendy because HEALTH, and probably unnecessary, like $125 \u201cnap dresses.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t want both.Vegan Caesar DressingBriny, creamy, with a hint of sweet-salty miso.Photo by Alex BeggsFall-y thingsProtein Maple MuffinAdd water, microwave, and watch the protein powder muffin puff up, thanks to the magic of RADIOACTIVITY!!! The texture, sort of a damp sea sponge, melts in your mouth and makes me want to eat more. But I can resist.Cinnamon Bun CookiesSOFT and plush like a stress ball, wow. These are miraculous. Inside the squishy cookies, a creamy filling that has never done a bad thing in its life.Photo by Alex BeggsTubs o\u2019 stuffHerbed Tahini SauceHeavy on the parsley, unfortunate brown color.Romesco DipStill too close to eating pasta sauce out of a tub.Cottage CheeseCurdy!Photo by Alex BeggsFrozen friendsKung Pao Chicken Mochi BallsYOU NEED TO TRY THESE. A crispy sweet mochi shell yields to chewy, and the filling is sparse, leaving big gaping holes to squish into. The filling is supposedly chicken, lots of ginger. Even my cat licked the tray clean. One late night during the weirdest, darkest times in our nation\u2019s history, I made dinner out of these, my beloved TJ mac \u2019n\u2019 cheese balls, and mini spanakopita while I yelled at the TV and scrolled Facebook Marketplace. Life can be enriching, inspiring, and artful. Or it can be this.Pork and Ginger Soup DumplingsI should have sprayed my metal steamer with PAM or something because my dumplings stuck, tore, and leaked their gingery soup. Treat these dumplings like your delicate heart: gently.Photo by Alex BeggsFrozen friends part 2Focaccia PrimaveraI\u2019m confused at reviews I\u2019ve seen online that describe this as \u201cdelicious,\u201d which is the opposite of what it is. It\u2019s a Frisbee-size puck with under-seasoned spinach-egg mush and a thin, dry crust. You\u2019re better off with the frozen spanakopita at Trader Joe\u2019s.Pumpkin empanadasClove bombs.Photo by Alex BeggsCheese-Less \u201cCheesecakes\u201dNot terrible!Photo by Alex BeggsDinner enhancersOrganic Ghee & Sunflower Oil SprayI thought this was a cool idea, in theory. In execution, the ghee squirts out of the nozzle in a direct splurt, not a diffused splatter. Do you know your squirts from your splurts and splatters? The sunflower oil is probably chemically necessary to make this product, but it adds a musky flavor I don\u2019t l-o-v-e. Idea: Make your own ghee!Pumpkin Curry Simmer SauceI saw that my vegan stepsister-in-law (hi, Meg!) loves this stuff, so I had to try it. You\u2019re supposed to add \u00bc cup of the brown goop to whatever protein you\u2019re cooking, but in my best judgment, I dumped the whole jar into a pan of mushrooms, kale stems, onions, and tofu. And that was the proper amount; it just didn\u2019t get me all the way there. Salt did. Somehow this product that has 120% of your daily sodium intake (if you use the whole jar, whee!) was mysteriously bland. LOL, that\u2019s processed food for you. Beguiling and bountiful.Tomato Spread\u201cSpread?\u201d Please, this is Portuguese tomato JAM. It is unrelentingly sweet, but a \u201cfun\u201d alternative to fig jam for your elaborate TikTok cheese platter. The slimy bits of tomato skin will satisfy people who enjoy peeling off their sunburns. ENJOY.Honey Aleppo SauceSweet \u2019n\u2019 smoky.Photo by Alex BeggsAnother SpreadApple Cider Fruit SpreadTake even the smallest spoonful of this \u201cspread,\u201d and you will get SMACKED with super, super concentrated apple cider flavor. Plus, little chunks of softened apples, how digestible. Over the summer I tried the watermelon spread\u2014avoid unless you like eating lip gloss\u2014but this is much better. I imagine you could: Spread it on ricotta toast, serve with a juicy pork chop, or swirl into vanilla ice cream for a homemade touch that\u2019s, ultimately, a lie.Photo by Alex BeggsSticksPumpkin Spice Baton Wafer CookiesLove these PSL wafers. The subtle, creamy filling didn\u2019t kick in until my third stick. I like how I can pretend they\u2019re long Cruella de Vil cigs\u2014and their portability. Here are all of the places you could store these wafers to have ready in case of low blood sugar: the pen pocket on your cargo pants, behind your ear, one of the holes of your toothbrush holder, inside a pencil box, any available window ledge.Dark Chocolate Cookies SticksThese are like extra thick Pocky. The cookie part is twisty\u2014to avoid breaking any cookie patent laws, perhaps?!\u2014and yet they still break easily. Tastes like chocolate-dipped printer paper.Photo by Alex BeggsThere\u2019s always a new milkUnsweetened Non-Dairy Hemp BeverageYou are wearing a hemp necklace (braided, maybe even beaded), and suck on it during class when you\u2019re bored. It tastes ropey. A little cardboardy. That\u2019s hemp milk for ya. I thought Raisin Bran might mask the flavor, but nope, I ate a bowl of soggy cardboard for breakfast.Photo by Alex BeggsCheesesShredded Unexpected Cheddar CheeseA reliable sharp cheese now in shredded form, but the shreds are twice as wide as usual shreds. Not sure why...unexpected?Dutch Spicy KaasI can still taste the lingering, overwhelming flavor of vegetal green pepper. The tricolor flecks are visually intriguing, but my family stood around the kitchen smacking our tongues trying to get that taste outta there. Maybe it\u2019s better melted on pizza? I\u2019ll let you find out.Photo by Alex BeggsBags o\u2019 nutsBazaar Basket Snack MixHeavy on the dried fruits. You\u2019ll get handfuls of just apricots and dried cherries here, which is great if you haven\u2019t pooped in a few days. Chickpeas are a dehydrated delight! Too bad this thing is in dire need of SALT, but that might be more of a personal problem.Dry-Roasted Maple AlmondsSo this is what Buddy the elf\u2019s breath tastes like. They\u2019re missing the shattering candy coating of a honey-roasted nut, saturated with maple flavoring, and just too dry for me to tolerate in my mouth. A place that puts up with a LOT.Read previous Trader Joe\u2019s reviews here.\u00a0Explore Bon App\u00e9titTrader Joe'sRead MorecultureTrader Joe\u2019s Latest Snacks, Reviewed in These Strange, Strange TimesBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
