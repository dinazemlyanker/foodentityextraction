It\u2019s great for a quick lunch or dinner and hits that spicy spot for those who love hot! Sometimes I\u2019ll sub 1 cup of the green beans for a cup of edamame to up the protein. I also typically sprinkle it with ground flax seeds to up the health punch. I find the chili crisp adds enough salt that I never need to add additional. ajgatorChicago, IL5/23/2020Love this! A festive and delicious dish! I used half peanuts and half cashew which was perfect! Searing the green beans as well as the tofu added richness. Thank you!Betsy AmitKibbutz Ein Hamifratz4/24/2020I was surprised by how much I liked this because I'm not typically a huge fan of raw celery, but I had a bunch hanging out in the fridge from cooking beans so I thought I'd give this a try.  I didn't wanna futz with making chili crisp, so I used chili oil I already had and fried up some crispy garlic to throw on top. Went with tempeh instead of the braised tofu and fried it til it was golden and crispy in the oil leftover from making crispy garlic. It was quick and really tasty.  If you're serving it as a main, it'll yield closer to two servings than four. cassidy.haightRichmond, VA8/8/2019So good! Summery, but also hearty. And that chile crisp is bomb. I had snap peas (not green beans), so used those instead. Also upped the lime and added fresh mint. It seems like you can add any number of things. I'm going to try green mango next time. AnonymousToronto4/12/2019So good! Was met with moldy green beans when I opened my fridge (yuck!) so spontaneously subbed Persian cucumbers. Added scallions, sesame seeds, and cilantro, and glazed my tofu with a gochugang/miso/dijon sauce whilst frying. kirafeldmanSt. Louis, MO9/25/2018I loved this! I sauteed the beans to provide some different texture, used cashews instead of peanuts. I served it with crispy skin salmon instead of tofu. My bf said it was one of the best accompaniments to fish I've ever made.
