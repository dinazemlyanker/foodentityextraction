This Gothersgade Street caf\u00e9 started out as a furniture and antiques store, and it shows (that\u2019s their gorgeous butik next door). Turns out the owners have an eye for great chefs too.ORDER THE: perfectly shingled avocado on whole grain toast; matcha granola with zucchini jam; seasonal sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d; and matcha latte. Chef Frederik Bille Brahe\u2019s menu keeps it healthy, with a camera-ready twist.THE VIBE IS: beautiful people in a beautiful room eating beautiful avocado toast. We\u2019re just going to warn you: Everyone here is better-looking and better\u2013dressed than 97 percent of Americans. And their apartments are prettier too. Still. Don\u2019t feel shy.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day: Monday to Friday, from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturday, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.; and Sunday, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Also visit the sister spots: Apollo Bar and the new Kafeteria SMK in the National Gallery of Denmark.\u2014Christine MuhlkePhoto by Ditte IsagerPhoto by Ditte IsagerWE ALSO LOVEDemocratic CoffeeOne more reason to love the library (or at least this Indre By one): buttery croissantsApollo Bar & KantineLook at contemporary art, eat some stellar bread at this Indre By hot spotGasoline GrillDon\u2019t be fooled by the gas pumps\u2014this mini chain serves Copenhagen's greatest burgerExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
