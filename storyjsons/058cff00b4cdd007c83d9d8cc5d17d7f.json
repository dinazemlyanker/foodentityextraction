First of All, They\u2019re Not PeppersSichuan peppercorns are essential in Sichuan cooking. Here\u2019s what else you need to know about these tiny, mouth-numbing flavor grenades.By Chala Tyson TshitunduSeptember 29, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Pearl JonesFacebookTwitterEmailAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

As one of China\u2019s Eight Great Cuisines, the inimitable culinary culture of this southwestern Chinese province is so spectacular that in 2011 Sichuan\u2019s capital city, Chengdu, was recognized as UNESCO\u2019s second ever City of Gastronomy. Responsible for bringing dishes like hot-pot, dan dan noodles, and mapo tofu to the global stage, Sichuan food is known for balancing big spice with pungent aromatics, as well as mind-blowing, mouth-numbing goodness courtesy of one special ingredient: the electrifying Sichuan peppercorn.What are Sichuan Peppercorns?For starters, they\u2019re not actually peppers. Unlike the red chiles that are also ubiquitous to Sichuan cooking, these petite \u201cpeppercorns\u201d are actually the berries of the prickly ash tree, which is a member of the citrus family. Harvested only once a year in the late summer, these tiny bumpy fruits are painstakingly picked from their thorny branches by hand and laid out to dry naturally in the heat of the sun.As they dry out, the berries open up into a distinctive floral shape that earned the spice it\u2019s local nickname hua jiao, or \u201cflower pepper.\u201d After open dried husks release their small black seeds, which are bitter and inedible, the fragrant peppercorns are hand-processed to ensure no thorns, seeds, or twigs make it into the batch. It\u2019s a labor-intensive process, but clearly a labor of love.How do they taste?There are two main kinds of Sichuan peppercorns: red peppercorns, which showcase an earthy depth, and green peppercorns, which are rarer and more floral. While both types taste great and boast beautiful citrus notes, the magic of these miniscule marvels lies as much in their function as in their flavor; instead of attacking the tongue with spiciness, Sichuan peppercorns induce a tingling sensation similar to drinking a super carbonated seltzer or eating a whole pack of pop rocks.\u201cI would say that it's almost a mouthfeel or a dimensional feeling rather than a taste,\u201d says Chengdu native Jing Gao, professional peppercorn enthusiast and founder of popular chili oil brand Fly by Jing. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely got mystical qualities.\u201d The piquant, numbing quality of Sichuan peppercorns comes from a chemical compound called hydroxy-alpha sanshool, which causes micro-vibrations across the tongue and lips that clock in at the same frequency of some power grids.Aside from being scientifically fascinating, the special effect of these peppercorns is also a key component of Sichuan cuisine\u2019s greatest gift to the culinary world, a numbing and spicy flavor profile known as m\u00e1l\u00e0. \u201cWhen the chile pepper was introduced to China a couple hundred years ago, it was said that the numbing quality of the Sichuan pepper would allow you to eat more chiles,\u201d Gao says. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a symbiotic relationship, and m\u00e1l\u00e0 became super well-known from Sichuan as a result.\u201dHow are they used?Because of its multitude of uses beyond just food, Sichuan peppercorns have been highly revered across China for more than two millennia. In addition to being incorporated into topical medicines and tinctures for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, certain varieties, like the rare gongjiao tribute pepper, were once harvested exclusively as fertility gifts for ancient emperors and their concubines.These tantalizing little wonders also have a litany of uses if the only thing you really want in your belly is a delicious meal. As a star ingredient in many chili oils and five-spice powders, Sichuan peppercorns are as versatile as they are unique. Whether you\u2019re craving perfectly cooked fish in spicy broth, garlicky marinated green beans, or a kick-ass cold noodle salad that\u2019ll come together in minutes, there\u2019s always a way to sneak in some Sichuan peppercorns for an elevated taste experience.\u201cIt\u2019s present in almost every dish in Sichuan,\u201d Gao says. \u201cOne stall in Chengdu has been making incredible pastries for a hundred years, and one of my favorite things there is this flaky butter cookie that\u2019s sweet, but also savory and numbing at the same time.\u201d Gao personally likes to take Sichuan peppercorn\u2013infused oil and put it on popcorn or drizzle it on ice cream. \u201cIt\u2019s just a really nice topping with citrusy overtones.\u201dWhere to buy themThe bad news: The quality of Sichuan peppercorns in the United States has been pretty poor for decades. In 1967, the peppercorns got caught in the crossfire of a USDA-issued blanket ban on Chinese citrus in order to prevent the spread of a bacterial disease known as citrus canker disease.Though the ban was lifted in 2005, exporters were required to heat-treat their peppercorns in order to kill bacteria before shipping them Stateside, which damages the potency of the product. The USDA has since reversed this restriction, but many companies still import cheap heat-treated peppercorns to sell in American stores.The good news: The internet exists and direct-to-consumer brands like Fly By Jing are here to combat the quality-control issues that have plagued many Asian food importers for decades. \u201cI started this company because there wasn\u2019t a go-to source for high-quality Chinese ingredients,\u201d Gao says. \u201cFor the longest time, people weren\u2019t willing to pay premium prices for Chinese products, so there was no incentive for producers to export anything of quality.\u201dFly By Jing Sichuan Peppercorns$23 at Bon App\u00e9tit MarketWhile studying under Sichuan master chef Yu Bo, Gao came to realize the importance of sourcing fresh food directly from growers. \u201cOver several years, I built relationships with the farmers [in Sichuan] to access ingredients before they sell out,\u201d she says. \u201cWe make sure to only carry what was freshly harvested that year.\u201dHow to store themBecause Sichuan peppercorns are dried, they won\u2019t \u201cgo bad\u201d per se, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll last forever. \u201cWithout the proper storage and proper treatment, it loses its potency very quickly,\u201d Gao says. \u201cIt has to be actually stored in a cool environment, so I store my Sichuan pepper in the fridge or the freezer.\u201d A surefire way to know whether your peppercorns have gone stale is to give them a good sniff. If you\u2019re not getting a waft of citrusy aroma, they\u2019re probably duds. \u201cThe highest quality peppercorns smell so strong,\u201d Gao says. \u201cIt\u2019s said that if you hold it in the fist of your hand, you can smell it through the other side. It\u2019s just so potent.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingtechniqueShoppingRead MorecookingBlack Vinegar Doesn\u2019t Just Season a Dish\u2013It Transforms ItBy Clarissa WeiRecipes you want to make.
