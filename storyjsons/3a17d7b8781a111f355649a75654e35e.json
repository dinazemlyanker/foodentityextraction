The best springform pan is made by Fat Daddio\u2019s, and if you love to bake, you need one (or, in my case, four). I own these pans in a few different sizes\u20146-inch, 12-inch\u2014but a standard 9-inch pan is the perfect choice for most springform recipes at home.Fat Daddio\u2019s Springform Cake Pan$17 at AmazonWhy is this the best springform pan?There\u2019s a lot to love about this pan, but two facets of its brilliant design stand out. Like all springform pans, it is made of two parts: the base and an outer ring. In many other designs, there\u2019s a raised lip around the base that fits into a notch in the outer ring. This notch can make the cake hard to remove from the pan onto a cake stand and will often leave a visible divot on the side of the baked good after unmolding. But the design of the Fat Daddio\u2019s removable bottom is inverted: The rim is lower than the bottom of the pan, which is raised\u2014it looks like a mesa\u2014and that the outer ring wraps around the raised middle section, leaving a lip around the edge. When the pieces are combined, the springform pan looks like a top hat. This makes for easy unmolding because it\u2019s a cinch to slide a spatula under your cheesecake\u2014something I\u2019ve always found incredibly tricky on most springform pans because of that little lip. It also ensures beautiful, impressively straight sides that are augmented by the pan\u2019s height\u2014my second favorite feature. I think it has the perfect depth for a springform pan (and many other pans fall short\u2026literally). At 3 inches deep, you\u2019ll never experience overflow, even with your tallest, most impressive bakes.There are still more reasons why the Fat Daddio\u2019s 9-inch nonstick springform pan is my top pick. The heavy-duty, stainless-steel, spring-lock buckle on the outer ring is the sturdiest I\u2019ve tried. It\u2019s still operating with the same strength and snap as the day I purchased it, with many bakes and washes behind it. It seals tightly (no leakage!) even when working with thin batter or a water bath. It also hits a lot of baker buzzwords: It boasts a nonstick coating and is easy to care for (hand-washing is recommended). Plus, it\u2019s made of restaurant-grade anodized aluminum, which means no warping. It may just be the well-loved springform cake pan you eventually pass down to your kids after years of baking together. And ringing in at just $20, this baking pan isn\u2019t even a splurge.Watch the Fat Daddio\u2019s springform pan in action.\nWhat else can I use a springform for?Yes, this is the perfect pan for baking cheesecakes\u2014classic, Basque, and beyond. But it\u2019s also the perfect bakeware for all kinds of other cakes. Springform pans are great when you\u2019re making a taller/deeper single layer cake, like this rustic fruit-studded cornmeal number. They\u2019re also handy for more delicate bakes, like chiffon or flourless chocolate cakes, because there\u2019s no flipping required. The easy release base and nonstick surface make it ideal for smoothly unmolding upside-down cakes, and it also works well for ice cream cakes and other frozen desserts. Personally, I love it for savory dishes like deep-dish pizzas, baked pasta casseroles, and tall, impressive tarts and quiches. Fat Daddio\u2019s even says that this pan is pressure cooker and air-fryer safe, so the sky is truly the limit here. (Yes, air-fryer cheesecake is a thing.)Ricotta Pie with Amarena CherriesOkay, this is actually a cheesecake, but it\u2019s so creamy and light that you won\u2019t care what it\u2019s called, you\u2019ll just ask for more.\u00a0View RecipeHow do I care for my springform pan?With any springform pan, the most important thing is to be sure to dry it very well after washing. Keeping the pan dry will keep the steel construction of the spring rust-free and working its sprightly best. Avoid using metal utensils whenever possible to keep any nonstick springform pan smooth and unscratched.Are there other worthy springform pans out there?Absolutely! The only negative about the Fat Daddio\u2019s pan in my book is that it is a little bulkier than a standard cheesecake pan because of the height and wider base. If you\u2019re looking for a solid option that will also take up a little less cabinet space, find a few favorites below:This bright red 9-inch springform pan comes from another reliable cookware brand, Nordic Ware. This pan isn\u2019t just snazzy looking, it is made from high-quality aluminum, is freezer-safe, and even comes with a 10-year warranty. It\u2019s not dishwasher-safe, so hand-washing is recommended if you want to keep it looking its best.Nordic Ware 9-Inch Springform Pan$20 at AmazonSilicone springform pans are prized for their nonstick ability, which can make unmolding even easier, and for their heat resistance\u2014this one from Norpro is safe up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. They are ideal for water-bath baking, but be sure you get one with a tight leakproof seal. These pans often boast glass bottoms so they can go directly from oven to table for service.Norpro Red Silicone Springform Pan$28 at AmazonWant more bang for your buck? This two-in-one springform pan set comes with two interchangeable bases: a flat base, like a classic springform, and a tube base\u2014so you can make Bundt and angel food cakes in the same pan. This model from Ballarini comes in three different sizes and is nonstick, dishwasher-safe, and oven-safe up to 450\u00b0F.Ballarini Nonstick Two-in-One Springform Pan$20 at Food52Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingToolsRecipes you want to make.
