However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Have we talked about how easy cookbooks are to WRAP? There are a lot of reasons why we think the best cookbooks of 2021 are the ideal gifts for any food lover, but it might come down to the fact that they\u2019re all the same shape\u2014and that shape is easy to wrap and slap a bow on. They\u2019re also the best gift because you\u2019re giving the gift of possibility. Whether it\u2019s a book full of dinner inspiration (the Weekday Vegetarians) or dreamy desserts (Mooncakes and Milk Bread), your gift-receiver gets to, for a moment, consider the rest of their lives ahead of them. Full of food.For the person who has an elaborate holiday baking regimenShe got me with the Scallion and Cheddar Cathead Biscuits (as big as a cat\u2019s head!). Cheryl Day\u2019s Treasury of Southern Baking bows down to butter, flour, buttermilk, and cornmeal. When you scratch beneath the frosting, you learn that this book wouldn\u2019t be here without Day\u2019s great-great-grandmother, who was born enslaved and left behind many of the recipes that are found in the book. And I flagged so many of them to make that my book appears to have feathers. Sock-It-To-Me-Cake! Grown Folks\u2019 Rum Cake! Razzleberry Pie! Jam-filled dumpling cookies that are shaped like chickens! We snagged a few recipes for Thanksgiving (that Sweet Potato Loaf!)\u2014check them out here, but take my word for it, you\u2019ll want the whole book once you have a slice.Cheryl Day's Treasury of Southern Baking$40 $34 at AmazonAnd because I couldn\u2019t pick a favorite, queen of cookies Dorie Greenspan has a new collection, Baking with Dorie, that includes a bold follow-up to her famous World Peace Cookies\u2014World Peace Cookies 2.0!\u2014which is the kind of breaking news I\u2019m here for. We also snagged the recipe for her Caramel Crunch\u2013Chocolate Chunklet Cookies (baked in a muffin tin!), and if you didn\u2019t think your winter was going to include chunklets, I\u2019m happy to say: How wrong you were. The baker in your life will be psyched with either of these as a gift, so why not get both?Baking with Dorie: Sweet, Salty & Simple$35 $30 at AmazonFor the bread-head:Tell me you don\u2019t want a fluffy, squishy, savory pork floss pull-apart bun right now. Liar! Kristina Cho\u2019s debut cookbook, Mooncakes and Milk Bread, had the BA Test Kitchen swooning, and these people don\u2019t swoon easily. If you know someone who got into bread, croissants, dumplings, or any other carby cooking project during the pandemic, get them this book and you\u2019ll probably be rewarded with a loaf of black sesame\u2013swirled milk bread on your doorstep in return. (That\u2019s how giving cookbooks works, I\u2019m pretty sure.)Mooncakes and Milk Bread$30 $27 at Amazon$30 $28 at Bookshop.orgFor the parent who really wishes these kids could feed themselves already:Jenny Rosenstrach\u2019s the Weekday Vegetarians is the family cooking cookbook of the year, but the thing is...I don\u2019t even have children. And I still want artichoke dip pizza, teriyaki-glazed crispy tofu and green beans, and definitely those caramelized shiitake tacos. I just needed a category for this cookbook, and the emphasis here is on flexible, crowd-pleasing family recipes, so there ya go. If there\u2019s a caregiver in your life who might appreciate some cooking inspiration, buy them pizza! But then get them this cookbook.The Weekday Vegetarians: 100 Recipes and a Real-Life Plan for Eating Less Meat$32 $22 at AmazonFor salami lovers:YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE. I have to say, when I saw Italian-American, I expected really good lasagna. But the appetizer chapter alone rewired my brain; every dish in here is so creative, so outrageously opulent, it feels like the team at Don Angie published every good idea they ever had and then sprinkled a little more parm on it. It makes me want to live more extravagantly, mostly via food. PEPPERONI RICE STUFFED IN MUSSELS. Salami and cheese croquettes. Again, these are just the apps. Shrimp parm meatballs! Swirling lasagna pinwheels! Vietnamese coffee tiramisu! Get this cookbook for the person who hosts the Feast of Seven Fishes every year, who always orders the limoncello, or who thinks shelf-stable parmesan shakers should be illegal.Italian American: Red Sauce Classics and New Essentials$35 $30 at Amazon$35 $32 at BookshopFor the person who has udon in their freezer at all times:Every time we publish a Hetty McKinnon recipe, I get excited because I know it\u2019s going to hit all the high notes. Her sesame tofu with broccoli is a house staple. Kimchi mac and cheese\u2014come ON. This cashew udon with crispy mushrooms, let\u2019s GO. Don\u2019t forget the pea and ricotta potstickers! Hetty makes recipes that are easy to follow, heavy on the veg, and just really damn delightful. Epicurious called To Asia, With Love the most \u201ccookable\u201d of the spring, and I\u2019d go ahead and say, \u201cof the year!\u201d A great gift for newer and experienced cooks alike, noodle hoarders, plant-based people, world travelers and homebodies, and people named Alex. Did I miss any?To Asia, With Love$43 at AmazonFor Grainiacs:I\u2019ll say it again and again: 2021 is the year of the grain, and these two cookbooks prove it. Buy Mother Grains for the baker who\u2019ll have their world opened up by the nutty magic of einkorn flour and get Grist for the person in a meal-prep rut looking for ways to make beans, lentils, and farro more interesting. Both are surefire hits.Mother Grains$40 at Amazon$37 at BookshopGrist: A Practical Guide to Cooking Grains, Beans, Seeds, and Legumes$35 $30 at AmazonFor the plant-based and wannabe plant-based person:Don\u2019t be scared, the vegan recipes won\u2019t bite ya. In fact, you\u2019ll be doing the devouring here because the chipotle barbecue sauce on the fried tofu torta is WOW. Jackfruit tinga, COOL. Edgar Castrej\u00f3n\u2019s Provecho is here for the vegans, the flexitarians, the plant lovers, and the all-around good time eaters. Let\u2019s not put it in too tight a box. Give this to the person who never saw a taco they didn\u2019t love, who could use a few new ways to fix up their frijoles, and who will appreciate having their mind blown by cashew cream tomato sauce slathered over their chile rellenos.Provecho$32 $22 at AmazonFor anyone who needs artistic inspiration:We shared an excerpt from Bryant Terry\u2019s Black Food in our September issue, and if you haven\u2019t made Jocelyn Delk Adams\u2019s cinnamon roll pound cake, get on that. I\u2019ll wait. Back yet? The book, which brings together a chorus of voices across the Black American diaspora, shape-shifts from recipes to art to essays, and you\u2019ll find something new every time you open the book to a different page. It\u2019s almost hard to call it a cookbook, because you\u2019ll be gaining more than a few recipes from it.Black Food: Stories, Art, and Recipes from Across the African Diaspora$40 $36 at Amazon$40 $36 at BookshopFor kids who already have their own aprons:Look, it was a toss-up between this and Vegetables in Holiday Underwear, but May Your Life Be Deliciosa is just too sweet. Read this story with your kiddo and then make tamales together on Christmas Eve and start a new tradition (one that leaves with you a stack of tamales to stash in your freezer). It was actually a great year for kids\u2019 books about food\u2014check out Soul Food Sunday, Tomatoes for Neela, and the Waffles + Mochi cookbook to give a whole stack of \u2019em.May Your Life Be Deliciosa$18 $17 at AmazonFor the first person you know who threw a dinner party this year:When I had to feed a houseful of visiting cousins this year, I went straight to \u00c0 Table by Rebekah Peppler because I knew the mayo chicken would knock \u2019em dead. And it did, along with the roasting pan of artichokes, potatoes, and shallots on the side. Her carrot salad was a hit on bonappetit.com this summer, and I made the easy persillade every time I had too much parsley (so, every time I had parsley). It\u2019s French-y but uncomplicated, and Peppler writes like the friend who lets you crash at her Parisian apartment\u2014she might even make you seven-hour lamb\u2014in exchange for too much wine. Love this cookbook, and I\u2019ll be getting it for all my friends who have a weakness for vintage glassware, good napkins, and, uh, mayo.\u00c0 Table: Recipes for Cooking and Eating the French Way$30 $18 at AmazonFor those who believe in \u201ceating the rainbow\u201d:Mumbai Modern by Amisha Dodhia Gurbani is a mood-boosting cookbook for anyone who needs one. These bright, colorful recipes can\u2019t not cheer you up. The recipes touch on Amisha\u2019s Gujarati roots; now she lives in Northern California and the bounty of citrus and veg spills over on every page. There are strawberry-hibiscus jam-filled morning buns sprinkled with freeze-dried strawberry dust (based on a BA recipe, hi!), a citrus and roasted beet salad with breadcrumb-coated paneer nuggets (!), and aloo tikki arancini with saffron aioli\u2014talk about pulling out all the stops. Every recipe is a stunner.Mumbai Modern$35 at AmazonFor the person who appreciates an indie project:Australian artist Alice Oehr put together this spiral-bound cookbook, Recipes with Friends, earlier this year, and I really admire the lounging pig on the cover\u2014and the Snoopy illustration for Cure-All Chicken Soup. It\u2019s a collection of recipes sourced from Oehr\u2019s friends, none of whom I know, but I like the idea of acquiring someone else\u2019s friends via a cookbook. (Also, I love her big cake slice prints for sale here.) I imagine if you polled all your friends for their best and favorite recipes, it\u2019d make for a hell of a cookbook. Maybe an idea to borrow for your own holiday project...Shameless Plug section!Brad Leone\u2019s first cookbook-slash-travelogue-slash-self-help-guide, Field Notes for Food Adventure, came out this fall, and anyone who\u2019s seen the man stick his arm in a catfish\u2019s mouth for the sake of YouTube needs this book faster than you can say \u201cwourder.\u201d You\u2019ll read every word in Brad\u2019s voice, which comes free of charge.Field Notes for Food Adventure$35 $30 at AmazonCarla Lalli Music\u2019s second cookbook, That Sounds So Good, is\u2014in my opinionated opinion\u2014even better than her first. Buy it for the polenta sheet cake alone, which I\u2019ve made three times now. A great gift for all the rice wizards out there, and anyone who has broccoli delight memorized.That Sounds So Good: A Cookbook$35 $31 at Amazon$32 at Bookshop.orgAnd lest we not forget our dear Molly Baz\u2019s Cook This Book came out this spring and shot up the best seller list. The pastrami roast chicken is worth the price of admission alone. I recently made her steak au poivre again last week and will be making another run at the black sesame shortbread this holiday because I am, in fact, the person with a stash of cookie tins in her basement. It\u2019s a great gift for newbie cooks, and it has handy QR codes (turned out to be a big year for THOSE, huh?) that link recipes to technique videos to show you how to carve that roast chicken, among other things.Cook This Book: Techniques That Teach and Recipes to Repeat$32 $20 at Amazon$30 at BookshopExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingGift GuidesRecipes you want to make.
