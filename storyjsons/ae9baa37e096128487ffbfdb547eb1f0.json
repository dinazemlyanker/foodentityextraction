Today they\u2019re separated by a man-made border\u2014but united by one extremely delicious sandwich.By Roberto Jos\u00e9 Andrade FrancoSeptember 30, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailAlfredo Alvarez at his El Paso sandwich shop, Lonches JuaritosPhoto by Justin HamelFacebookTwitterEmailAlfredo Alvarez was bored and tired of working at IHOP. It was the type of boredom that comes from being at the same place for nine years. He\u2019d worked there so long he\u2019d even grown tired of the smell of pancakes. \u201cI was a cook. But my goal, always, was to open a business,\u201d he tells me in Spanish. \u201cI wanted to start a loncher\u00eda, which you hardly saw here.\u201d Loncher\u00edas are Mexican snack shops popular in Ju\u00e1rez, the city where Alvarez was born and where his father-in-law started a shop in 1975. And \u201chere\u201d is El Paso, Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s sister city just across the Rio Grande, where Alvarez now lives.Alvarez\u2019s plan began with saving money. He then asked his son, an engineer, a simple yet vital question: \u201cI told him, \u2018You\u2019re good at math, you know more than I do, so how many lonches do I need to sell a day to get the same pay I got at IHOP?\u2019\u201d Whenever Alvarez talks of his college-educated children, there\u2019s pride in his voice. \u201cHe told me I had to sell 20. I said, \u201820 lonches a day? That\u2019s not too difficult.\u2019\u201dEventually, Alvarez had saved enough to buy the frame of a puesto in Ju\u00e1rez. There\u2019s no exact English translation for puesto, but food trailer comes close. \u201cI got the skeleton of it, and I told my manager at IHOP that was it,\u201d Alvarez says. \u201cI gave my two weeks\u2019 notice.\u201dOnce he brought the puesto across the border, it took a month to finish building it. It was small, with just enough room for two people. It had a griddle and a mini range hood. Alvarez parked it at the Bronco Swap Meet in El Paso\u2019s lower valley, where vendors sell everything from cowboy boots to Mexican candies and snacks. His sign read \u201cLonches Juaritos\u201d (Ju\u00e1ritos being a loving term for Ju\u00e1rez). \u201cI sold over 65 lonches that day,\u201d Alvarez recalls. \u201cI went home so happy. And that\u2019s how we started.\u201dSix years later Lonches Juaritos has grown into a small brick-and-mortar restaurant next to the same swap meet where it all began. And today, just as back then, Alvarez's best seller is the lonche de colita de pavo: the turkey tail sandwich.Lunch is served.\nPhoto by Justin HamelWhile Mexican foods like tu\u00e9tano (bone marrow), barbacoa, menudo, and just about any taco you can think of have grown popular in the United States, colitas de pavo remain associated with the El Paso\u2013Ju\u00e1rez borderland. Perhaps that will change. Smithsonian Magazine says one reason for the food's limited appeal is that they\u2019re the parts of animals\u2014the \u201cbeaks and butts\u201d\u2014that consumers from wealthier countries won\u2019t eat. That\u2019s far from true in Ju\u00e1rez, a city that the news organization Norte Digital calls \u201cthe world capital of colitas de pavo.\u201d There the sandwiches are \u201cone of the few dishes that can be presumed to be 100 percent local.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re a delicacy,\u201d Alvarez says. Turkey tails are most often fried, roughly shredded, and reddish on the outside, with a succulent interior that looks like the dark meat of chicken. They taste like a combination of chicken and pork, specifically carnitas. Alvarez makes a special seasoning for his colitas de pavo and serves them with mayonnaise, mustard, lettuce, and avocado. He uses bolillo bread\u2014a crunchy crust on the outside but soft on the inside\u2014from a local baker who also moved to El Paso from Ju\u00e1rez.Alfredo Alvarez\nPhoto by Justin Hamel\u201cSome people\u2014as soon as they bite it, as soon as they taste it\u2014tell me the flavor brings back memories of when they could visit home,\u201d Alvarez says. Because of politics, COVID-19, and a variety of other reasons, it\u2019s become more and more difficult to cross between El Paso and Ju\u00e1rez. Even before the pandemic an increased presence of customs and border patrol agents could force people to wait for hours in the hot desert sun. During the pandemic United States authorities limited border crossing to essential travel. The only Juarenses that can cross to El Paso now are those who work, go to school, or seek medical treatment there.The separation has been difficult for this binational community. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people that still just can\u2019t return,\u201d says Alvarez, whose restaurant is only about a mile from the Rio Grande.Before the Mexican-American War, El Paso and Ju\u00e1rez were one place. El Paso del Norte was its name, and it had a river running through it. After the war that river\u2014in Mexico called the Rio Bravo, in the United States called the Rio Grande\u2014became the natural border between the countries, splitting the community in two. And yet, despite now being in different countries, the cities of El Paso and Ju\u00e1rez still share a history and culture.Most El Pasoans of Mexican heritage have family ties to Ju\u00e1rez. Some even grew up splitting their time between the cities on opposite sides of the river; from Monday through Friday they\u2019d work and go to school in El Paso, then they\u2019d return to Ju\u00e1rez on the weekends. But now that crossing the bridge has become more difficult, several restaurants have popped up on the El Paso side that try to replicate the taste of home.How the tails get cooked\nPhoto by Justin Hamel\u201cA lot of people ask me if my lonches taste the same as the ones in Ju\u00e1rez,\u201d Alvarez says. \u201cI tell them they won\u2019t be the same because it\u2019s very difficult for me to go to Ju\u00e1rez every day to bring back products. There are also products I can\u2019t bring back.\u201d (Because of potential pests and diseases, poultry, fresh fruits, and vegetables are among the things that can\u2019t cross into the United States from Mexico.)\u201cPeople tell me they\u2019re similar,\u201d Alvarez says of his lonches. \u201cSometimes they tell me it\u2019s better there, or that it\u2019s better here. But that\u2019s the way it is. That\u2019s what I tell people. We try to copy that Ju\u00e1rez flavor as best we can.\u201dIf the flavor isn\u2019t enough to remind patrons of home, the simple decor of Lonches Juaritos surely will. Black-and-white pictures of borderland landmarks and notable residents past and present decorate the walls. Alvarez downloaded, printed, and framed each one himself.Customers eat under Alvarez's photo wall.\nPhoto by Justin HamelI spotted Tin Tan, the Ju\u00e1rez comedian who best symbolizes the borderland's unique merging of cultures\u2014even speaking his own type of Spanglish. There\u2019s a photo of the Ju\u00e1rez Avenue mural honoring Juan Gabriel, the city\u2019s favorite son and one of Mexico\u2019s most influential artists, who often sang about his love of home. There\u2019s a landscape of downtown Ju\u00e1rez, near the international bridge where for decades United States authorities sprayed toxic chemicals on Mexicans who crossed from Ju\u00e1rez to El Paso, claiming they carried disease.Alvarez says people will sometimes stop and stare at the pictures after ordering their food. \u201cThey stand there and take photos of those photos. They tell me, \u2018It\u2019s because it\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve been to Ju\u00e1rez.\u2019\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titCultureTexasRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
