Still, we can\u2019t get enough of it.By Emily Schultz and Rachel KartenMarch 11, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailWelcome to Food on the Internet! A column from Rachel Karten and Emily Schultz, BA\u2019s social media team, dedicated to all the weird things we see while scrolling, double-tapping, and retweeting.Following a restaurant on Instagram in 2019 is nothing if not predictable. A post of a new dish on the menu? Check. Overhead shot of a popular brunch item? Check, check. Occasional pic of the staff smiling in the kitchen? Check, check, check. That\u2019s why D.C. restaurant Spoken English\u2019s account stopped us in our scrolling tracks.Click over to the tachinomiya-style restaurant\u2019s profile and you might find Tom Hanks in his famous role as Forrest Gump sitting on that just-as-famous bench holding\u2014no, not a box of chocolates\u2014but chicken yakitori. Or maybe you\u2019ll see Daenerys Targaryen ditching her dragons for chicken skin dumplings. Matilda digging into a date dessert? There\u2019s that too. Every single one of the pop-culture-y collages is straight up bizarre, but the oddly impressive mashups and pitch-perfect nostalgic references suck you in. Paired with a yellow background that\u2019s so bright it almost requires sunglasses, the images here are a far cry from the naturally lit ones flooding our feed.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Do the posts show us what the nightly specials are or what the general vibe of the restaurant is? No. But, for us, that\u2019s totally fine. Because, instead, the account serves us an entire attitude, practically cracking open the restaurant\u2019s brain to show its personality, taste, and ethos\u2014or at the very least, its Netflix history.\u201cSince Spoken English is a non-traditional restaurant (i.e. a standing restaurant [editors\u2019 note: that means no chairs for sitting, btw]) we wanted to make sure that we had a social media presence that really represented the spirit of the restaurant and its food,\u201d says Bruner-Yang, founder of Foreign National, the development group behind the restaurant. So they took the 1990s pop-culture references they grew up with, combined them with late 1960s/early 1970s graphic design techniques like typography and collage, and added a layer of their Japanese street food\u2013style dishes on top.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\u201cI use characters that remind me of my childhood\u2014what I used to watch when I was a kid,\u201d Christian Zuniga, the group\u2019s creative director, wrote via email. \u201cI\u2019m originally from Chile and I grew up absorbing American culture through movies, music, cartoons, and toys. I love how through these collages we can mashup different cultures, visually combining our food, our experiences, and taste.\u201dAs wacky as the visuals may be, they\u2019re an accurate reflection of the restaurant\u2019s weird and untraditional vibe IRL. Because there are no chairs\u2014and because they blast Talking Heads\u2014diners are constantly dancing between bites. Because it\u2019s a tiny space, you feel like you\u2019re practically a part of the kitchen, not just peeking inside it. And because the food itself is just as quirky, offbeat, clever as its collages: Dumplings with a chicken skin wrapper; twice-baked potatoes with uni and caviar; dessert made out miso, eggplant, and fennel. It might not all make sense on paper (or on screen), but you want to consume it. And that\u2019s all that really matters anyway.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsInstagramFood on the InternetRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
