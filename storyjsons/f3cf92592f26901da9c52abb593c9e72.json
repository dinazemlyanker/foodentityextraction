Roasted pecans. Warm baking spices. Citrusy, caramelly Amaro Montenegro. A bit of spicy rye whiskey. They all work well together to create a cocktail that feels toasty. That\u2019s what I love in a winter drink.\u201d A second shake with an egg white creates a velvety texture and foamy top.IngredientsMakes 1Orgeat2cups raw pecans2tsp. black peppercorns1\u00bdtsp. coriander seeds1tsp. whole allspice2cups sugarCocktail1\u00bdoz.

Add sugar and 1\u2153 cups water and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar. Let cool and strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a heatproof measuring glass; discard solids.CocktailStep 2Combine amaro, rye, lemon juice, and \u00be oz. orgeat in a shaker filled with ice. Shake until outside of shaker is frosty, about 30 seconds. Double-strain into a glass, then return to shaker. Add egg white, cover, and shake again until frothy, about 1 minute. Pour into a chilled coupe glass and top with a pecan.* Raw egg is not recommended for the elderly, pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems\u2026or people who don\u2019t like raw egg.How would you rate Amaro Cocktail?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (11)Back to TopTriangledon't throw out the solid when making the orgeat! take out the spices and roast the sugar spice flavored nuts in the oven until caramelized! MCBCT8/22/2021Could you please tell us where you bought that cup from? Thanks!Rucha Moharir6/22/2021Such a great cocktail... for left over orgeat cooked down and used in a creme caramel spiked with a bit of amaro... easy way to relive the cocktail and use up egg yolks!JcSydney1/1/2021Roy, it says 3/4 oz. orgeat.Crazy Jerry Ireland 12/31/2020I see that the orgeat syrup is left out of the recipe.  What is the proportion to use??RoyCornelius, NC12/30/2020I love love love this winter cocktail!Amy CarderDenver12/27/2020Great recipe, definitely a keeper! I don\u2019t have Montenegro, so I split the amari 50/50 with Braulio and Ramazzoti and it worked beautifully. I\u2019ve made similar takes on a sour with a rye base, alchermes as a modifier and oleo saccharum for a sweetener, but reversing the base is a nice touch. \nThe commenter suggested replacing amaro with amaretto made me vomit in my mouth, shame on you! algomalo 12/25/2020I apologize in advance for taking such liberties with this cocktail recipe.  Here is what I did and the result was really nice.  Subbed Amaretto for Amaro (I know that they are not the same thing but I am always looking for ways to use up that bottle of Amaretto in the back of the liquor cabinet) and changed it to a 1:1 rye to Amaretto (1oz to1oz heavy on the rye).  The rest of the cocktail used same  lemon juice and orjeat syrup amounts, with addition of the egg white.  Worth a try.Lizzie TDuluth, MN12/20/2020Delicious, but I halved the lemon as I like drinks a little bitter.dcVancouver, BC12/13/2020A delicious and well-balanced cocktail!  Made once with the Rittenhouse, then again with a smoky peaty scotch for more of a \"fireside\" feel.  It went over well both ways.  \nMake the Pecan Orgeat from scratch  (with the addition of a touch of orange blossom water and vodka for a preservative) and was surprised at how tasty it was.   Now I can't wait to find more recipes to use it in!Spatula City 123Los Angeles, CA12/7/2020Good drink. Much easier to purchase orgeat than make your own.
