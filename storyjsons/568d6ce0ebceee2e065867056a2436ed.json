More often than not, I pick the latter, even when my throat is drier than the Atacama Desert. Wrong decision, I know, but sometimes I\u2019d rather continue working on an assignment (and, by \u201cworking on an assignment,\u201d I mean binge-watching emotional puppy videos on The Dodo) than walk all the way to the sink. Two hours later...still thirsty. But I\u2019ve decided to turn my life around with a little help from my half-gallon Pankio water bottle\u2014and now a sip of water is always within arm\u2019s reach.Photo by Emma FishmanPANKIO Water Bottle$16 at AmazonMy Pankio water bottle looks like something you\u2019d see a bro with ripped deltoids carrying around at the gym because it is, essentially, a sports water bottle. It is not for the timid\u2014it\u2019s for the dehydrated. Equipped with a hefty handle, a leak-proof cap, and a thick lanyard, it\u2019s made of heavy-duty BPA-free plastic and is, importantly, also 100% free of phrases like \u201cKeep on drinking!\u201d or \u201cAlmost there!\u201d Its transparent design means I can always see how much water is in it\u2014and there is almost always water in it because it\u2019s so big. This thing is a beast, and drinking out of it will make you feel like one too.My Pankio is so sturdy that I know it won\u2019t spill or break should I decide to take it on the go. But it goes nowhere. It sits on my desk from nine to five, all day, every day. While my morning coffee brews, I fill it up, and I\u2019m set for the next eight hours. And although dramatically tilting my head all the way back to take a swig from a 5-pound jug of water during Zoom calls might make colleagues think I\u2019m doing too much, I like to think that it sort of matches my entire life\u2019s aesthetic: extra.I\u2019ve learned a lot since purchasing this bottle, like that drinking water through a straw out of a dainty little glass is a very inefficient way to stay hydrated. I\u2019ve also learned that just like you don\u2019t have to actually do yoga to wear yoga pants, you don\u2019t have to play sports to own a sports water bottle.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make.
