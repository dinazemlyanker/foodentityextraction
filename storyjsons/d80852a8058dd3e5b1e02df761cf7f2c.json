The spongy cake has an unabashedly liquid center that bursts forth the moment the chocolaty dam is broken by spoon. Many recipes achieve this effect by purposely undercooking the cake, so that the middle is raw batter. Effective, but not the most delicious.In our version, a spoonful of chilled ganache is placed at the center of the cake batter. As the bake time ticks down, the ganache is rendered molten as the batter shores up around it.You\u2019ll need four 6-oz. ramekins to pull off the recipe (though a jumbo cupcake or muffin tin will work in a pinch). We like to butter and then line the individual dishes with demerara or raw sugar (instead of the more typical flour or cocoa powder) for little pops of texture. If you\u2019d like to serve with a dusting of powdered sugar or a scoop of vanilla ice cream, be our guest. Watch how this chocolate lava cake is made here or take a chance on chocolate lava cake\u2019s caramel counterpart instead. \u2013Joe SevierEditor\u2019s note: This recipe was originally published as BA\u2019s Best Molten Chocolate Cake on February 2, 2016.Ingredients4 servings\u00bccup heavy cream7ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped into small pieces, divided6tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for ramekinsDemerara or raw sugar (for sprinkling)3large eggs\u2153cup light brown sugar1teaspoon vanilla extract3tablespoons all-purpose flour\u00bdteaspoon kosher saltSpecial EquipmentFour 6-ounce ramekinsPreparationStep 1Heat cream in a small saucepan over medium until just beginning to simmer.

Beat in vanilla.Step 5Gently fold melted chocolate into egg mixture until incorporated.

Will make again and again--if you make ahead, note that your ganache center may sink to the bottom. Added cardamom and might try saffron or orange next time around.SumaiyaSan Francisco, CA12/30/20211. I love that this recipe takes a lot of the stress out of lava cake \u2013 \u2013 with the ganache in the center you don\u2019t have to obsess over the timing. Also no raw eggs, so pregnancy friendly!\n2. This recipe is slightly more work than other lava cakes I have made, however I would say the effort is worth it. \n3. I did not follow the directions and put too much batter in each cup. This only made three cakes. Obviously a user error. \n4. I love that this cake can be refrigerated raw and baked off at will. I\u2019m excited to have this recipe to throw down once dinner parties are an option again \u2013 \u2013 coming in hot with a lava cake always makes you look like a gSarah TMaine4/12/2021Amazing! Super rich though (I definitely recommend adding a fruit topping like raspberry or strawberry to help combat the richness of it) but overall 10/10, I could\u2019ve shared 1 ramekin with my significant other due to the richness! Definitely saving this one!JuliaLos Angeles, CA2/15/2021I used a very high quality chocolate and this was absolutely delicious.  I cooked it for 13 minutes, and probably only needed 11 or 12, so I will check it earlier next time.AnonymousMassachusetts4/26/2020I just made these and they turned out great! I baked for 13 minutes and the cake was a little bit on the dry side, but my scale was out of batteries so I had to kind of guesstimate the amount of chocolate (side note, can all math be about chocolate? I think I'd like it more if it was), but honestly, I think it would just soak up ice cream or creme anglaise that much better. So not really a problem. The batter was SO LIGHT! Like, it held its shape when I scooped it into the ramekins, which was really cool! It made the baked cake very airy and nice. I baked one cake and froze the other 3 to make fresh when I'm feeling lazy and need some chocolate. Stellar job as always!honeybeebutchMinneapolis9/12/2019I made these for a special Valentine's Day dinner and they were superb!!! Easy to make and tasted like a 5 star restaurant dessert.
