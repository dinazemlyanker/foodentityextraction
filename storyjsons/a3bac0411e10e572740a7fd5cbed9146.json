She says she\u2019s \u201ctired of fine-dining,\u201d and as of the announcement made on March 25, she\u2019s received overwhelming support from the restaurant community, food media, and her regulars. In the days when restaurant cooking was flashy and theatrical, and long before San Francisco\u2019s Hayes Valley became a hotbed of trendy restaurants, des Jardins opened this quietly confident white table-clothed, French technique\u2013driven, local produce\u2013powered restaurant. It was a revolutionary move in 1997, and Jardini\u00e8re soon became an institution. But it was more than just a groundbreaking restaurant; it was a home for all who came in to dine, and especially to those who came to work. How do you close a restaurant with so much history? Des Jardins is figuring that out. \u2014Elyse InamineWe\u2019ve changed a lot of things at Jardini\u00e8re over the years to stay relevant. We got rid of the live music and replaced the stage with a somm station. We turned the dining room downstairs into a lounge. Recently, I\u2019ve been examining what works and what doesn\u2019t at Jardini\u00e8re. I was trying to figure out what else we could do to keep the restaurant fresh and current. I don\u2019t think there was one moment, but I realized I didn\u2019t want to change anything. I\u2019m proud of the work we\u2019ve done. The hospitality. The food. The wine service and the cocktails. I stand by it. So I decided to close Jardini\u00e8re.I\u2019ve opened a lot of restaurants, but I\u2019ve never had the experience of closing one. I reached out to colleagues who had and asked them: How can I do this graciously? How do I do this in a way that makes sense on my own terms? I\u2019ve always been self-reflective and thought about my impact on the world; it probably came from my parents. \u201cTreat people the way you want to be treated\u2014with fairness and kindness,\u201d they said. As I close Jardini\u00e8re, I just want to make sure everyone, whether they\u2019re guests or staff, feels like someone cares. That\u2019s the person I want to be in this world.Des Jardins with Audie Golder, the current executive chef of Jardini\u00e8re. He's been at the restaurant for the last eight years.\nPhoto by Ed AndersonSo, we talked to the staff first about a month ago, and it was extremely emotional. It was an all-staff meeting, which doesn\u2019t happen that often. They were wondering what was going on. I had remarks prepared, but the emotions took over, not just in terms of my own feelings but the staff\u2019s. When you run a restaurant as long as I have, you have people who have been there for 19 years. It\u2019s family.The public announcement happened at the same time. With social media, you have to be mindful. If one staff member puts it on social media, then word gets out. We had to be cognizant of communication. Since then, I\u2019ve been in the restaurant every night. Guests have come back, like a couple who had their first date, got engaged, threw their wedding reception, and eventually brought their kids here. Reliving that whole trajectory of people\u2019s lives and understanding the role that the restaurant has played in their lives has been incredibly rewarding. I\u2019m talking to dozens of people every night, some I know well and others I don\u2019t. It\u2019s exhausting, but it\u2019s my way of letting go and saying goodbye as well as my way to give the staff support.Perfectly cooked duck, the Jardini\u00e8re way.\nPhoto by Ed AndersonSome have left already, which is expected, but a lot of them have stayed on. They want to go out strong. The most important thing to me is that every single person who works for me has a job and a sense of work security moving forward. We have 65 employees. There are a lot of opportunities, so the management team and I are looking at each person and making sure there is a spot for them that is best for them. We know things, like where they live and what they think the ideal job is for them. We\u2019re a close-knit community.Twenty-one years ago when we opened, we offered health care for our employees; we paid 50 percent of it from the beginning. These were the things that were important to me as an operator. I want to make sure my staff is moving into a new job that has those same aspects. I have one runner who is going to work at Prospect. I know Kathy King and Nancy Oakes; they have a similar service and kitchen style. And I know he\u2019s going to be super happy and feel appreciated there. We\u2019re very much in process on this\u2014we\u2019re not done until everyone who needs assistance is taken care of.A lot of restaurants try to gently go away when they close and not make noise about it. Not making any judgments about that, but I decided to go through this process much more publicly and use it as an opportunity to share. This is something a lot of people will go through. It\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s not all positive. I\u2019m curious how I can be a leader in this kind of stuff. There\u2019s a lot of learning to be done, but I\u2019m realizing closing can be done gracefully. And it can serve a purpose.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsChefsSan FranciscoFirst PersonRead MorecultureMy Restaurant Was the Greatest Show of Excess You\u2019d Ever Seen, and It Almost Killed MeBy David McMillan of Joe BeefrestaurantsAfter Three Moves, A Cult Neapolitan Pizzeria Calls NYC HomeBy Anthony MangierirestaurantsHow a Cheap, Bent-Up Composition Notebook Helped Me Open a RestaurantBy Ori MenasheRecipes you want to make.
