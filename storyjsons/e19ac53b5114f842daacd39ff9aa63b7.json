Buttery, sugary, flaky, and tender doesn\u2019t even begin to describe this magical Breton invention.ORDER: everything above, plus the large-format kouign-amann. Sure, you\u2019ve probably seen the pastry in small individual-size wheels, but we can\u2019t get enough of these super-size ones that are baked and sliced into wedges. It may just be the best $2 CAD you\u2019ll ever spend.THE VIBE IS: tiny and unassuming, until you walk into the storefront. It smells like heaven. Before you grab one of the few tables, admire all the shiny golden-brown kouign-amann in the pastry case.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day: Monday to Friday 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.\u2014Molly BazLuisa Gonzalez P.Luisa Gonzalez P.WE ALSO LOVESt-Viateur Bagel ShopSettle the great bagel debate by getting a dozen at the famed Mile End mini chainCaf\u00e9 OlimpicoGet your caffeine fix at this Mile End espresso shopDrogheria FineRun, don\u2019t walk to this Mile End window shop doling out perfectly tender gnocchiExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
