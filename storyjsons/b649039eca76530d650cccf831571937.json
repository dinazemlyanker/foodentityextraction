Add the beef, parsley, basil parmesan, egg, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt and \u00bc teaspoon black pepper. Stir to combine and form into 16 meatballs.Heat a large high-sided skillet, preferably enameled cast iron, over medium-high. Add the oil and swirl to coat. Arrange the meatballs in the skillet in a single layer and cook, until well browned on the first side, 3 minutes. Then, turn meatballs, no need to be super gently, allow them to break up slightly. Continue to cook, turning a few times, until mostly crisp and golden on the outside, about 10 minutes more. Pour the marinara into the skillet with the meatballs and gently stir to combine.Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti per package instructions until al dente. Drain and transfer to the pot with the meatballs and sauce. Toss to coat and serve with more parm & a sprinkling of parsley and basil, if desired.Sponsored by Rao\u2019s Homemade\u00aeGET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for the Bon App\u00e9titNewsletterSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyExplore Bon App\u00e9titRao\u2019s Homemade\u00aePastaMeatballItalian AmericanGround BeefSpaghettiMainNut-FreeDinnerMore from Bon App\u00e9titRecipes6 Pro Chefs Reveal Their \"Secret Weapon\" Ingredients2022-03-02T17:00:00.000ZrecipePorcini Gnocchi With Butter Sauce2022-03-15T09:00:00.000ZrecipeWhiskey Sour2020-12-16T18:20:00.000ZBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
