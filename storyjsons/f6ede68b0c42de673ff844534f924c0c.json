We were away from home and she needed a pick me up, so I tried to make that salad with this dressing. My first attempt followed the directions to the \u201cT\u201d but it was acidic and a little thin. For version 2.0 I dropped the vinegar to only 2 Tbsp, added 2 Tbsp more of the cashews and nudged the pepper flakes to a full tsp. Perfect!  Thank you for the great recipe!  You made her very happy!  Jos\u00e9 G3/17/2021I've made this twice now! I didn't have any cashews tonight so I used crunchy PB and a skosh less oil instead.... BOMB! This is my new everything dip.jonathancurtisCarlsbad, CA6/24/2020OMG - Delicious!  Easy too. Decadent tasting but really kinda healthy. It'll be good on all sorts of stuff aside from salads.\nSteve BlanchardPrince Edward County, Ontario4/13/2020Awesome on roast veggies too, broccoli, cauliflower, etc. I bet it would be great on steamed sweet potatoes too. It is now a staple in out fridge.AnonymousSeattle4/9/2020Wow \ud83e\udd29 what an amazing dressing! Loved it. Saving it and adding it to my collections of BA recipes \ud83e\udd70jessicaolBrooklyn, NY4/7/2020This will change the way I look at cashews. Surprisingly smooth and tasty, although next time I will increase the amount of red pepper.nczippy Mount Rainier MD4/5/2020This dressing is so addictive. I love how the flavor of the rice vinegar shines through. Good also as a dipping sauce or in something like a burrito. balderdash4/1/2020For those looking for a fish sauce substitute, try vegan \"fish\" sauce made with oyster mushrooms! Or a good dash of soy sauce and some miso paste :)AnonymousCincinnati, OH3/31/2020I\u2019ve made this with sunflower oil and olive oil and it\u2019s just as delicious! Super creamy with a bit of a kick. I put it on everything. Game changer.cdustNew Jersey11/29/2019This recipe was a nice change up it seems like a lot of red pepper flakes but do add the entire amount! delicious!! Colorado11/7/2019Delicious on any kind of green salad. Was too cautious with the red pepper flakes, but full amount next time. AnonymousMexico10/6/2019 So easy to make and super delicious! Really seems like it would be great on everything. (And I don't really like cashews!)AnonymousLos Angeles9/29/2019Wonderful dressing and very easy to prepare, I used worchester instead of the fish sauce and it was excellent!AnonymousNorthern Virginia9/16/2019This dressing just found a permanent place in my refrigerator. Gotta have it at all times. LOVE this recipe. Thanks.AnonymousNYC9/12/2019This is delicious. I followed the recipe but used a fresh Thai chili instead of flakes and added a cube of ginger. Can\u2019t wait to have a salad! This also would be great on cold poached salmon or chicken.capemaycookCape May, NJ9/10/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titCondimentCashewNutDairy-FreeGluten-FreeHealthyishRecipes you want to make.
