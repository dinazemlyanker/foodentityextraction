I had bowls of fresh cilantros, watercress, & sliced shallots on the table for people to add in as they ate. It was really good. Will definitely be making this again. Gigi KAtlanta, GA12/20/2020We were worried about the heat from reading the reviews, so I used 1/4tsp of ground sichuan peppercorns in the marinade and 1/4 in the final step.  Also, we used jalapenos instead of the dried chilis as we never eat the dried and wanted a little more flavor.  We used Mahi Mahi and loved it - we will definitely serve this again.elizengNew York City6/11/2020This recipe is a bit flawed if made as written. I agree with the other reviews about spice level. Skip the 20 Chiles at the end and I\u2019m one who really enjoys heat.  Otherwise, this dish can be really delicious with some common sense alterations. AnonymousBethesda, MD5/16/2020This soup gets rave reviews every time I make it. I don't even like fish soup normally, but this is on a different level. It's spicy but not killer as long as you adjust the dried chilis. I am dying to know what kind of chilis Bon Appetit used such that they could add 32! I used 5-6 dried chilis (I'm not sure but I think they were facing heaven peppers with a couple of dried Thai chilis) and the spice level was 8/10. I always use tilapia for the fish.AnonymousWashington, DC4/25/2020I took a clue from the other reviewer and went halfsies on the peppers.  I also skipped the last topping, opting for just the sesame seeds, cilantro and scallions for topping.  I used Orange roughy, which was just right. The ingredients were easy to find at my local Asian market.  The dish was delicious!  Flavorful and just the right amount of spicy.   The broth was really tasty with the aromatics and fermented chili paste.   It may be just too much Szechuan.pepper for us westerners as written.   LynsoCincinnati 4/20/2020I found this basically inedible. There's just WAY too much happening, to the point where I didn't enjoy the spiciness (and I LOVE all spicy food), but instead just found it punishing. Also, the way the recipe is written is intensely confusing. Generally speaking, I adore Bon Appetit and love everything I make from the magazine, but this was just a bust for me.
