Slowly but steadily, Down North Pizza in Philadelphia has been converting customers with this pie, listed on the menu as the Flip Side. This Detroit-style version is made with an impossibly fluffy dough and is topped with caramelized pineapple and a tangy, smoky homemade barbecue sauce (feel free to substitute with your favorite store-bought sauce). Executive chef Michael Carter uses beef bacon to keep the pizza halal, but pork bacon works equally well.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Do libs ever look at themselves in the mirror and say 'WTF'?AnonymousGreen Bay, WI12/18/2021Very tasty pizza.  The spice level was little more than I would have thought. (Good thing I like spicy)\nA lot of different flavors hitting your taste buds at one time, but in a good way.\nThe amount of dough seemed like a lot, I\u2019ve done a Detroit style pan that used half as much flour. \nNext time maybe in a larger sheet pan with less dough.\nI will definitely make again.M8keSpringfield, IL11/20/2021cultural appropriation, lol. \nIt's like getting mad at someone for sitting up front when you called shotgun that one time. Anonymous11/2/2021LMAO cultural appropriation?  Libs are classic. Martin 9/24/2021A lot of work and a lot of pots and pans to clean for some pizza, but it was worth it. These ingredients seem meticulously thought through and this combination of flavors take what we all know as Hawaiian pizza to the next level. This isn't that lame sliced ham and canned pineapple ring pizza... This is made from scratch, made with love, each and every step pizza.JosephSan Francisco9/23/2021The anonymous reviewers should go back to eating their Shaq-a-roni Pizzas.  Hawaiian Pizzas have been around for decades.Steve9/17/2021I love the story behind this recipe and the recipe looks great! Thank you Michael Carter for all you're doing to lift yourself and the people around you up! I wish you great success. I don't want to stir up controversy but I fail to see how calling a pizza with Pineapple (which often comes from Hawaii) is cultural appropriation. Maybe the idea to put Pineapple on a pizza didn't originate in Hawaii (but do you know for sure?) but recognizing where the deliciousness came from seems like an accolade to me.Anonymous605619/16/2021In light of everything that happened at Bon Appetit, I\u2019m super disappointed to see you publish this recipe. There is no such thing as Hawaiian pizza. It\u2019s cultural appropriation and alludes to colonialism and imperialism in Hawaii.
