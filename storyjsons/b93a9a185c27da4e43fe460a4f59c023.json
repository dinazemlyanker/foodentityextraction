It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Easter!!!It is Easter! The holiday I can never forget because I always get a text from my [unnamed family member] that says, \u201cHe has risen!\u201d This weekend, if everything goes as planned in my rhubarb-shopping endeavors, I\u2019ll be making Claire Saffitz\u2019s famous rhubarb custard cake. No mixer required, custardy simple filling, beautiful fruit topping. My colleagues said that if I can\u2019t find rhubarb, any fruit on top will do. How about that.Get the recipe: Rhubarb Custard CakePhoto by Amy Lombard...And hot sauce for allWhat I appreciate about this world and the people in it, is that there are gathering spaces where we can come together and try nearly 50 different hot sauces on a Sunday. It\u2019s called the Hot Sauce Expo, and this was its seventh year running in Brooklyn. I went last weekend and had one of the best times of my life. It attracts a crowd of passionate, brave, hardcore fans\u2014who own chile pepper\u2013printed leggings and leather hot sauce holsters. Metal was blasting, people were chugging cartons of whole milk, and I met a man with a solid gold chicken wing necklace. There was a sauce so hot that nearly everyone who tasted it ran to the bathroom to puke, then run back to proudly tell me how awesome they felt. It was called Right Hand of Doom. I tried to relive the beautiful insanity of the event here.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!The other sauceRed Sauce! Did you see our Red Sauce America package this week? I wrote about Carrabba\u2019s Chicken Bryan, the entree with a cult following and a friendly name. But my favorite Red Sauce piece was Hilary Cadigan\u2019s essay about working at Bertucci\u2019s. I\u2019d never heard of the restaurant, but she captures that teenage awful-but-at-least-it\u2019s-something first job phase. The workplace crush. The free pizza scam. The cranky boss who can\u2019t believe he\u2019s still managing this place. I loved every word.Open a bottle of Chianti and explore Red Sauce America here.Photo by Rachel Tepper PaleyIt\u2019s not actually pigeon, chillHave you attempted our \u201cpigeon\u201d pie? Writer and Bon App\u00e9tit contributor Rachel Tepper Paley made the recipe, the most challenging and epic recipe of Rick Martinez\u2019s Game of Thrones menu (for the rest of you, Sansa\u2019s lemon cakes are the easiest!), and I was IMPRESSED. Hot water crust! Blind bake! Elaborate meat filling (pork, prosciutto, and chicken)! Hers turned out beautifully. \u201cIt was a convergence of two great loves,\u201d she said, \u201cThe Great British Baking Show and Game of Thrones.\u201d Brava, Rachel! You\u2019re our star baker on the Iron Throne this week.Get the recipes: Ceremonial \"Pigeon\" Pie and Sansa\u2019s Lemon Cakes5 degrees of Nancy MeyersThis week, Alex Delany gasped. \u201cI was just followed on Instagram by...Nancy Meyers?\u201d The esteemed director, it turns out, follows a handful of BA staffers, so I asked them how it felt.Chris Morocco: \u201cI am so honored!\u201dCarey Polis: \u201cFamous director/producer Nancy Meyers, potentially seeing what I cook for dinner! What a world!\u201dAlex Delany: \u201cIt\u2019s rad. Everyone likes to talk about Nancy Meyers\u2019 movie kitchens, but the vineyard/cellars in The Parent Trap is better than any kitchen.\u201dCarla Lalli Music: \u201cHi there, I am on the road until Friday, April 19, and my responses will be sporadic until then.\u201dPicture dayWhile taking our staff photos this week, Alex Lau got a stunning shot of Emma Fishman, which is now his caller ID for her:\u201cI\u2019ve been looking all over for you\u201dWhen I heard Cristina Martinez (our director of editorial operations) say that, I assumed it was because I haven\u2019t done some important paperwork for months and was finally being called out on it. But no. She whipped out her phone and showed me a video of a raccoon eating cherries.Unnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Susie Theodorou, prop styling by Heather GreeneWe had a Red Sauce America\u2013themed live podcast this week and onstage, Claire and Chris argued onstage about tiramis\u00f9 (Chris developed a fantastic recipe for it too). Claire hates it because it\u2019s \u201cboth wet and cold.\u201d Chris loves it because it\u2019s a balanced, layered, creamy nostalgia trip. It loosely translates as \u201ccheer me up\u201d or \u201cpick me up\u201d\u2014how can you not love it?! But the staff is divided. Team Claire includes features editor Meryl Rothstein, who calls it \u201cNothing special, though I\u2019ll eat it if it\u2019s in front of me.\u201d Alex Delany, a certified statistician, said, \u201cfive percent of tiramis\u00f9 is great tiramis\u00f9.\u201d \u201cThat math\u2019s off,\u201d said Carey Polis. Amanda Shapiro is team Chris, arguing that anything with coffee and booze can\u2019t be bad. Sarah Jampel shakes her head, \u201cI don\u2019t like the dampness. It\u2019s damp in there.\u201d On Amiel\u2019s birthday this year, his wife made a baby pool\u2013sized tub of tiramis\u00f9 that was served with a shovel\u2014he loves it. \u201cIt\u2019s pudding by another name!\u201d said Amiel. We discussed whatever the texture of ladyfinger cookies are. At the podcast, Chris called them crispy-gone-soggy, but crispy-gone-soggy authority Amiel feels it\u2019s more like \u201cspongy gone soggy, and it\u2019s perfect.\u201d \u201cEveryone likes Oreos dunked in milk,\u201d preached Emily Schutz, her voice rising in exasperation. \u201cIt\u2019s the same texture!\u201d Voices cried out: \u201cNo it\u2019s not!!!\u201d And Delany waved his hands about saying, \u201cNo other dessert solves this problem. When you need coffee, cream, cookies, and booze\u2014no other dessert will solve that.\u201d And if those are the types of problems in your life, I wish you all the best.Get the recipe: Old-School Tiramis\u00f9Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecultureJoy, Pain, and Puke at the 2019 Hot Sauce ExpoBy Alex BeggsPhotography by Amy LombardcultureThe Best Etsy Stores for Hunting Vintage PyrexBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
