I had no use for whole oranges with extra pith, squeezing them and scooping out the white lining made for less bitter tea and fresh juice. The second step is useless. After boiling ingredients for five minutes, turn off the heat, wait for bubbles to recede, add tea, steep to desired taste then serve with honey alone. Lemon here seems like a throw at it and it was the worst idea. The green tea version on the stove is cooling now. Bon Appetite nailed this combination of flavors as Indian tea trifecta.Emme SfeaDenver, CO8/10/2021I'm curious to know why remove from heat and let sit then heat it up again?Cami SoCal Cycling ChefSan Diego, Ca6/15/2021I totally missed \u201ccook for three minutes\u201d in Step 1 the first time around. Perhaps it should be a separate sentence or the paragraph should end there. I was so confused I re-boiled, cooked, and let sit again. Anyway, I obviously didn\u2019t do a good job following the steps exactly, but it seemed like the lemon just overpowered the whole thing. Don\u2019t be like me!Anonymous5/7/2021I can\"t wait to try it.Anonymousoklahoma city5/6/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titHot DrinkDrinks AllIndianSouth AsianAsianCardamomHerbs & SpicesCinnamonGingerGreen TeaAlcohol & Other DrinksFallWinterEasyQuickSnackDrinksDairy-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreeVegetarianKetoNonalcoholicRecipes you want to make.
