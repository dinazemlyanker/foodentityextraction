Will anyone listen?By Jake MalooleyJuly 23, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone via Getty ImagesFacebookTwitterEmailA few weeks ago, Vienna Beef opened a history museum in Chicago as part of the company\u2019s 125th anniversary celebration. Among the artifacts on display are hand-painted advertisements of mid-century vintage, a meat grinder dating from 1859, a gold-plated cocktail weenie, and a photo of the stand at the city\u2019s world\u2019s fair in 1893, where the Vienna Beef hot dog made its debut. Visitors who work up an appetite during a tour can head over to the factory store cafe and tuck into a Chicago-style dog.On a recent afternoon, a mile east of the Vienna Beef museum, Kay Stepkin swung open the front door of the Lincoln Park library, where a very different Chicago food story was on view. The sprightly 75-year-old made a beeline to a small, carpeted room at the building\u2019s rear that was the temporary home of the National Vegetarian Museum, which she founded in 2016 and debuted last year. The first vegetarian museum in the country, its name nods at grand ambition\u2014but its present is rather humble. The nascent institution\u2019s first travelling exhibit, \u201cWhat Does It Mean to Be Vegetarian?,\u201d has been on a tour of libraries across Chicago. It\u2019s a modest display, made up of a dozen seven-foot-by-three-foot panels littered with archival materials (a reproduction of the 1974 debut issue of Vegetarian Times, featuring a recipe for mushroom loaf), persuasive factoids (\u201cUp to 51% of greenhouse gases come from livestock\u201d), and quotes from notable vegetarians (quoth Einstein: \u201cNothing will benefit human health and increase chances for survival of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet\u201d). There\u2019s also a small video installation that traces plant-based eating through the ages, from Pythagoreanism in the 6th century B.C. to the present day.Having spotted Stepkin passing through the foyer, a librarian stepped out from behind a mountain of books on the front desk and sheepishly approached. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Kay,\u201d she said in a whisper. \u201cI turned off the video. Honestly, no one was watching it.\u201dThe report didn\u2019t seem to trouble Stepkin. \u201cOh, that\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cWould you mind turning it back on?\u201d The librarian fired up the monitor and the chirpy voice of the video\u2019s narrator, vegan author and podcaster Victoria Moran, filled the otherwise empty room.A longtime vegan raised in Chicago whose father made his living as a wholesale meat dealer and delivery man, Stepkin always knew a vegetarian museum would be a tough sell here. The city\u2019s most well-known culinary identity is deeply anchored in flesh\u2014in slaughterhouses and steakhouses, in Polish sausage and Italian beef, in hot dogs and deadly serious hot dog condiment orthodoxy. But there\u2019s another, long-neglected, chapter of Chicago food history: Around the turn of the 20th century, even as the city\u2019s South Side was the capital of the U.S. meatpacking industry, Chicago emerged as the center of the American vegetarian movement. During that period, the city saw a then-unparalleled surge of new vegetarian restaurants, vegetarian grocery stores, vegetarian social clubs, and vegetarian publishing houses. To Stepkin, these facts add up to a kind of counterhistory, and a response to the prevailing narrative of Chicago as \u201cHog Butcher for the World\u201d\u2014poet Carl Sandburg\u2019s enduring description of the city circa 1914.Stepkin was first acquainted with vegetarianism in the mid-1960s, during a two-year stint living in Berkeley, California. Upon returning to Chicago, she secured a loan from her father, and in 1971 opened the Bread Shop, a bakery and natural food store in the Lakeview neighborhood on the city\u2019s North Side. \u201cUntil I opened the Bread Shop, I had never met another vegetarian in Chicago,\u201d she says. \u201cBut as soon as I opened the doors, they started coming in.\u201d Stepkin soon spun off an adjacent vegetarian restaurant, the Bread Shop Kitchen, which she shuttered in 1982. For more than 40 years, Stepkin had believed that the Bread Shop, which she closed in 1996, had been Chicago\u2019s first business catering to vegetarians. To her knowledge, no one disputed the claim.In the summer of 2012, Stepkin was writing a regular vegan recipe column called \u201cThe Veggie Cook\u201d for the Chicago Tribune and began to receive invitations to speak publicly about vegetarian history. \u201cI went to the library to see what there was that I didn\u2019t know, not only about vegetarian history in Chicago but nationally,\u201d she says. \u201cI was absolutely stunned by my findings.\u201dStepkin learned that Chicago was where American vegetarianism was first put on the international stage, during the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition of 1893, which celebrated the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the so-called New World. That exposure helped the city swiftly develop into the U.S. hub of organized vegetarianism. During the fair, a meat-free boarding house opened near the fairgrounds in the south-side Englewood neighborhood, catering to the delegates of vegetarian organizations who had arrived in the city from England, Germany, Switzerland, India, Australia, and beyond. That, it turned out, was Chicago\u2019s first fully vegetarian business. It was soon joined by a handful of vegetarian clubs, local offshoots of the Vegetarian Society of America (VSA). By 1900, the VSA was compelled to relocate the headquarters of its national publication, The Vegetarian Magazine (formerly known as Food, Home and Garden), to Chicago from Philadelphia, the nation\u2019s first capital of the meatless movement. That same year, Chicago\u2019s first vegetarian restaurant, the Pure Food Lunch Room, opened in the downtown business district known as the Loop.\u201cI was just amazed! I thought I would\u2019ve heard something\u2014anything!\u2014about this history,\u201d says Stepkin, who had served as president of the Chicago Vegetarian Society from 1994-1998 and again in 2000. The experience planted in her the seed of the idea for the National Vegetarian Museum. \u201cIf I didn't know the truth about Chicago\u2019s vegetarian history, I thought, neither did anyone else.\u201dStepkin was right, of course. Chicago\u2019s vegetarian past \u201cis forgotten,\u201d says Tim Samuelson, the city\u2019s official cultural historian. \u201cIt\u2019s not written about. You don\u2019t hear people talk about it at all. It just doesn\u2019t come up.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a real historical amnesia there,\u201d agrees historian Adam D. Shprintzen, author of The Vegetarian Crusade, a woefully under-read book that delves deeper than any other into Chicago\u2019s improbable rise as a hub for the meatless movement. \u201cVegetarians themselves have a kind of amnesia about this time period in Chicago, because it doesn\u2019t fit neatly with our popular ideas of vegetarianism. We associate Chicago with industrial modernity\u2014and people\u2019s assumptions are that vegetarianism is this back-to-nature movement.\u201d The modern vegetarian movement that grew in Chicago after the Columbian Exposition, Shprintzen explains, happened in lockstep with the industrial growth of the city. \u201cThere was a breaking away from vegetarianism with a social reform agenda and a move toward vegetarianism as a way to reform the self\u2014to be competitive in an increasingly corporate society.\u201dIn his book, Shprintzen charts this critical shift in vegetarianism in the 19th century: From 1817\u2014when a migration of 41 meat-abstaining Bible Christians first brought organized vegetarianism to Philadelphia from England\u2014until the start of the Civil War, various U.S. groups saw dietary reform largely as a route to progressive social reform: the abolition of slaves, women\u2019s suffrage, gender and economic equity, an end to war. But the strain of vegetarianism that later took root in Chicago had a more commercial and individualist bent. In June 1893, during the world\u2019s fair, some 200 vegetarian delegates representing groups from around the globe gathered at the newly opened Art Institute of Chicago for what was called the World\u2019s Vegetarian Congress. Throughout three days of lectures, movement notables such as John Harvey Kellogg\u2014the same Kellogg responsible for Corn Flakes was superintendent of the pioneering Battle Creek Sanitarium health spa and developed early meat substitutes such as Protose\u2014extolled vegetarianism as a way for individuals to achieve health, physical strength, and industriousness, as well as economic success and social advancement.\u201cChicago as a vegetarian center kind of made sense, because people there were more intimately involved in the implications of the modern meat industry,\u201d Shprintzen says. \u201cIf you read accounts from the time period, during the summer, people could smell rotting meat wafting into the Loop.\u201d In the classic muckraking novel The Jungle, Upton Sinclair described the odor from the meat factories as \u201clike the craters of hell.\u201d The horrors depicted in the book led to the passage, in 1906, of the Pure Food and Drug Act and the Federal Meat Inspection Act\u2014two landmark pieces of regulatory legislation.\u201cThe Jungle led to a lot of people becoming vegetarian,\u201d said Stepkin, gesturing toward a small image of the book\u2019s iconic olive-green cover displayed in the exhibit. On the same panel is an advertisement for the Pure Food Lunch Room, which ran in the September 1900 issue of The Vegetarian Magazine. It billed Chicago\u2019s first veg restaurant as \u201cclean, airy,\u201d with \u201cgood ventilation,\u201d \u201cquick service,\u201d and \u201cappetizing food\u201d at \u201cmoderate prices.\u201d The restaurant\u2019s claim of serving \u201cpure food\u201d projected the healthful properties of vegetarian cuisine and also exploited a growing anxiety among people at the turn of the 20th century about the handling and processing of meat and milk. Neither Stepkin nor Shprintzen was able to dig up a Pure Food Lunch Room menu, but Shprintzen theorizes, based on the vegetarian cuisine of the time, that \u201clunches were pretty simple: things like asparagus on toast, broiled tomatoes\u2014light fare. The idea was that a heavy meal would lead to less productivity in the afternoon.\u201dThe opening of the Pure Food Lunch Room ushered in a boom of vegetarian businesses in Chicago in the early 1900s. The publishing house Vegetarian Company produced The Vegetarian Magazine, vegetarian cookbooks, and other pro-veg literature. Chicago\u2019s vegetarian restaurant options, according to advertisements and classified listings in The Vegetarian, expanded to include such establishments as Mortimer Pure Food Company, the Ionia, the Vegetarian Good Health Restaurant, the Hygeia Dining Room, Robertson\u2019s Physical Culture Restaurant, as well as scores of private vegetarian dining clubs. Popular vegetarian grocers included Benold\u2019s Pure Food Store, an Old Town \u201cbakery of the genuine unfermented whole wheat bread,\u201d according to one ad. Berhalter\u2019s Health Food Store and Bakery, also located in Old Town, asked Vegetarian readers, \u201cWould you like to be a successful vegetarian?\u201d The store pitched its products\u2014wheat bread, rice, raisins, figs, olives, olive oil, et cetera\u2014as \u201cin accordance with Vegetarian Dietetics,\u201d promising \u201cprogress in physical health and spiritual wealth.\u201dThe salad days of Chicago vegetarianism would last until only the second decade of the 20th century. \u201cWhen I finally found out the city\u2019s vegetarian history goes back to the 1800s, I also realized the movement kind of came to a halt in the early 1920s,\u201d Stepkin said as she concluded the exhibit tour. \u201cIt was World War I, the Great Depression, World War II, and then vegetarians as a movement didn\u2019t pop up again until the 1960s. I thought, This could easily happen again. I don\u2019t want our history to get lost again.\u201dShe held a grim expression for a moment. Then, suddenly, her face brightened. Something remarkable had happened: a real, live person had strolled into the room to check out the museum\u2014the first in more than an hour. Stepkin watched intently as the woman browsed the exhibit panels.\u201cHi! I just wanted to say hello!\u201d Stepkin said after several minutes. \u201cAnd to let you know we have fliers over there.\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI came in to use the Internet, and I saw the sign as I was leaving the restroom.\u201d She was in town from the Bay Area to escort her son, a DePaul University student, back home to California for the summer. \u201cWe\u2019re both vegans,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see information about it.\u201d\u201cWell, California might be a bigger vegan center,\u201d Stepkin said, \u201cbut this is the first vegetarian museum in the country!\u201d\u201cMake sure it gets on the back of a truck and gets to lots of libraries,\u201d the woman said. \u201cGet the word out there any way you can.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titChicagoVeganessayVegetarianHealthyishRead MorecultureThis Civil Rights Activist Is the Reason I've Been Vegan for 30 YearsBy Tracye McQuirterRecipes you want to make.
