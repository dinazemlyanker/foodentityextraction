Damon suggests eating them with fried catfish, shrimp smothered in bacon gravy, mushrooms simmered in red curry, or \u201cas our ancestors intended, with just a simple pat of butter.\u201dAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Wrap sweet potato tightly in foil and bake on a small rimmed baking sheet until a knife slides very easily into flesh, 35\u201345 minutes. Let cool.Step 2Bring broth and milk to a simmer in a large saucepan over medium heat.Step 3Meanwhile, place grits in a medium bowl. Pour in cool water to cover and gently swish grits around with your hands until chaff separates and rises to surface. Using a spider or small fine-mesh sieve, skim chaff from surface and discard. Drain grits in a fine-mesh sieve. Repeat process 2 more times.Step 4Whisk grits into broth mixture, making sure there are no clumps. (It\u2019ll look like you have too much liquid, but the grits will expand into creamy goodness as they cook.) Cook, still over medium heat, whisking often, until thick and creamy but with a little bite, 25\u201330 minutes.Step 5Unwrap sweet potato and peel. Transfer flesh to a medium bowl and mash until creamy and smooth (you should have about 2 cups). Add to grits and blend with an immersion blender until incorporated. (An immersion blender yields the creamiest grits, but you can use a standard blender; carefully blend sweet potato and grits, then transfer back to pan.) Stir 4 Tbsp. butter into grits; season with salt and pepper.Step 6Transfer grits to a large shallow bowl; top with a pat of butter and season with more pepper.Adapted with permission from Black Food: Stories, Art, and Recipes From Across the African Diaspora by Bryant Terry (4 Color Books).
