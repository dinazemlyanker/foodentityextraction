The acidity in the citrus juice works to gently thicken and set the cream into a rich and velvety pudding. With no distracting eggs, cornstarch, or gelatin needed to thicken the possets, you get pure dairy richness primed to showcase the flavors of your choice\u2014in this case, zingy grapefruit and sharp but floral guava. Reducing the cream on the stovetop is not optional\u2014it helps remove excess moisture for perfectly set possets (i.e., spoonable and just barely bound).All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I did my posset base with blood orange rind and juice and used a grapefruit marmalade thinned with a hit of lemon juice for the jelly. So many possibilities! I suggest simmering the cream longer for a more custardy base; mine was rather thin but still delicious. Loved it!Cat SPacifica, CA3/5/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titDessertFruit Dessert5 Ingredients or FewerEasyGluten-FreePuddingNut-FreeGrapefruitCitrusFruitGuavaRecipes you want to make.
