But this time of year I field one specific crisis call: What should I drink on Thanksgiving?! Even among somms, Thanksgiving dinner is a notoriously difficult meal to pair because of all the sides. How do you find a wine that plays well with a green bean casserole, three types of stuffing (it\u2019s a competition in my family), and creamy mashed potatoes?In the past I\u2019ve leaned on tried-and-trues like Prosecco and Lambrusco, but this year I\u2019m tying the meal together with a few bottles of orange. Also known as skin-contact wines, they\u2019re made by fermenting white grapes with the skins on, like you\u2019d normally do for a red wine. I recommend starting with a light-maceration option that\u2019s spent only a few days fermenting with the skins\u2014like steeping a bag of tea for an extra few minutes to extract more flavor and aroma. The result tastes like white wine with the volume turned up, but not as intense and barnyardy as some other orange varietals. And because of their floral aromatics, heightened acidity, and fruity flavor, these wines work well with just about anything on your table.So this Thanksgiving I\u2019m pouring slightly chilled glasses of Domaine Glinavos\u2019s Paleokerisio, with half the bubbles but twice the flavor of Prosecco; Oenops\u2019s Rawditis, full of grilled lemon and apricot notes (perfect for Chardonnay-loving relatives); and Manolis Garalis\u2019s Terra Ambera, which tastes like orange blossom and jasmine, a reminder of The Summer That Could Have Been. It\u2019s a new tradition, like muting my uncle on Zoom, wishing I was in Santorini, and telling myself that there\u2019s always next year.Buy them:\u00a0Domaine Glinavos\u2019s Paleokerisio, $15 at Leisir Wine\u00a0Oenops\u2019s Rawditis, $30 at Astor Wines & SpiritsManolis Garalis\u2019s Terra Ambera, $22 at Astor Wines & SpiritsExplore Bon App\u00e9titWineThanksgivingThe PourRead MoreLifestyleThe 5 Types of Wine to Bring to ThanksgivingBy Marissa A.
