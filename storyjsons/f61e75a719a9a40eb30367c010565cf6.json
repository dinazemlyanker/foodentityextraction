Up next is Constance Wu, the Golden Globe-nominated star of Crazy Rich Asians and Fresh Off the Boat on ABC.Constance Wu grew up in a Taiwanese household, but when she thinks of her comfort food, she doesn\u2019t think of spicy mapo tofu (though it is her favorite Taiwanese dish).\u201cI love Taiwanese food, but I think its aromas and its flavors are a little bit too intricate and delicious to be comfort food\u2014I think comfort food is kind of bland,\u201d Wu said while hosting American Express\u2019s Pay It Plan It event in New York City. \u201cI think of mashed potatoes as comfort food, because they kind of taste like nothing.\u201dEven though she has never learned to cook her mom\u2019s Taiwanese classics like a thousand-year-old black duck egg with tofu, green onions, and soy sauce, she has fond memories of dishes like that and eats them when she can. But her perfect meal is probably Italian food like a good bolognese or a Caprese salad.Here's what else Wu is into right now, from a surprising travel snack to her pet bunny .My idea of a perfect meal is\u2026 probably Italian food, eaten slow and leisurely with people I love and a great cocktail. My go-to drink is a Manhattan\u2014and I take it perfect.The next place I want to travel is... New Zealand. I really love Lord of the Rings, so I want to go to all the places where they filmed, like the Shire.My dream dinner party guest list would include... the cast of Crazy Rich Asians, Barack and Michelle Obama, Oprah, Ghandi, and Legolas [Orlando Bloom], obviously.I always travel with... my Kindle and those pastel-colored fruity Mentos. I carry at least two packs of them. Normally I read physical books, but when I\u2019m traveling, I don\u2019t like to have so much bulk in my bag.The book on my to-read list is... Ann Patchett\u2019s new book, Nashville: Scenes from the New American South . That\u2019s next, because I loved Commonwealth, which takes place partially in the Commonwealth of Virginia where I grew up.I\u2019m listening to... Miguel and Khalid on repeat lately.But my Fresh Off the Boat character, Jessica, would jam to... wholesome, female-driven music like Barbra Streisand, Shania Twain, and Amy Grant.When I\u2019m stressed out... I love to get full-body massages. That\u2019s when I\u2019m really stressed. If it\u2019s just after a regular long day at work, I like to just talk on the phone to my old friends from high school. I prefer phone calls to texts, because it\u2019s an actual exchange. It\u2019s a flow, and it\u2019s not preplanned. I respond a lot to people\u2019s voices, and I just love conversations. I don\u2019t even like podcasts that are just one person talking.Podcasts on my rotation are... Another Round, Two Dope Queens, and Oprah\u2019s SuperSoul Conversations.At the end of the day, I unwind by... immediately changing into pajamas. It\u2019s always the first thing I do. It\u2019s a matching set: the button-up, long sleeved shirt and the pants in some kind of fabric that is lightweight and has a bit of stretch to it, like just a regular plain cotton.My favorite piece of clothing is... a miniskirt. I love to wear miniskirts when I go out with friends. I have a few denim miniskirts and a corduroy one. I like the way it makes my body look, and when you feel like you look great, it boosts your confidence. When your confidence is boosted, you\u2019ll have a great time.To practice self care\u2026. I take my bunny, Lida Rose, to work with me. She hops around my trailer all day. It feels like self care to take a moment to care for an animal and spend time with an animal. It\u2019s doing something that doesn\u2019t have to do with a screen or with your job; it\u2019s really just about downtime.If I could give a young Asian person advice, I would say... there\u2019s no one right way to push representation forward. Do what speaks authentically to you and focus on that. Not only will that help with representation, but it makes better work.Explore Bon App\u00e9titPerson of InterestCelebritiesHealthyishInterviewsRead MorecultureRachel Brosnahan's Winter Strategy Involves Bone Broth and Swaddling Her Dogs in BlanketsBy Alyse WhitneycultureDumplings, Kaya Toast, and Chili Crab: Inside the Food of \u2018Crazy Rich Asians\u2019By Alyse WhitneyRecipes you want to make.
