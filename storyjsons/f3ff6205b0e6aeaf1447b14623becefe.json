This week we talked to Sarah Thomas-Drawbaugh, founder of Healthyish Foods, an organic baking kit company that clearly shares our perspective on how to eat right.There\u2019s no such thing as too much dessert\u2014at least on paper. In practice, however, my stomach would disagree. As someone who loves to bake and is admittedly terrible at self-control, I\u2019m all too familiar with the pangs of brownie batter-induced stomach aches. It\u2019s a sensation Sarah Thomas-Drawbaugh hopes to eliminate with her organic baking kit company Healthyish Foods.While most baking kits rely on artificial food dyes and preservatives, Healthyish Foods creates all the classic flavors using whole-food ingredients like beet powder, turmeric, and essential oils. Plus the single-serving baking cups you bake these treats in are unbleached and biodegradable. Thomas-Drawbaugh's goal is to offer an accessible, thoughtful baking kit that makes you feel as good as it tastes, and reduces food waste in the process.We talked with Thomas-Drawbaugh about the challenges of creating a certified-organic business, the notepad that keeps her on track, and the pre-hike breakfast that fuels her.What\u2019s your approach to baking?I love dessert but it\u2019s really hard to make a cake or tray of brownies for just one or two people. You always have a huge copious amounts of leftovers that you overindulge in and feel terrible about or food waste, which is a huge issue. I thought, \u2018there\u2019s got to be a better way of doing this!\u2019 I started by thinking about what would be an ideal product to have in my own household: single servings, high quality ingredients, organic. I wanted to create a company that gets people to think differently about desserts in general.What was the journey like starting an all-organic business? I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of paperwork to contend with.I feel like every day is surprising and there\u2019s always something you\u2019re not anticipating. There are a lot of regulations and policy that go into running an organic business!  You have to establish a number of programs that meet strict criteria from a traceability, quality, and auditing perspective, plus things like pest management. You have to have a lot of process in place, and, like anything, it just takes time to identify what\u2019s going to work best for your business. It has been a journey, and I have a whole new respect for the organics process!What has been your biggest, most unexpected challenge since starting the business?Definitely educating people on what you\u2019re doing and why it\u2019s important. I think it\u2019s hard to grab people\u2019s attention in a world where we\u2019re constantly inundated with media. It\u2019s hard to stand out from the crowd, which is one of the things that was so important to me.Do you have any habits that keep you grounded and on track?I\u2019m huge on accountability and one of the things I do to hold myself accountable and make sure I\u2019m on track is document everything. I take lots of notes and keep a list of my needs so I\u2019m on top of everything\u2014if I tell someone I\u2019m going to do it, I write a note to myself and make sure I do it. I use my Erin Condren notepad, I feel like in such a digital world it\u2019s nice to have a physical touch. Their products are so fun\u2014they have inspirational quotes which I appreciate.Can you share any memorable advice you\u2019ve received as an entrepreneur?For me, one of the biggest keys has been finding mentors because I didn\u2019t have a background in this space. I\u2019m not an expert in every aspect of this business, and every day I\u2019m figuring things out. I\u2019m actually part of a female founders food forum in Boulder, and having that support makes all the difference in the world\u2014even having someone to chat with about things that aren\u2019t just food related. I feel like that\u2019s what \"healthyish\" is all about, not forcing yourself to be perfect all the time, just doing the best that you can and knowing that\u2019s okay.If you could pick one person's brain about Healthyish Foods over lunch, who would that be?I would have to say Jaclyn Johnson. She is the founder of Create and Cultivate and I really enjoy her new podcast WorkParty. I\u2019d love to hear her perspective on building brand recognition when you\u2019re still in startup mode, and to discuss strategies for capturing and maintaining loyal customers.What are the three things you always have stashed in your fridge or pantry?I love veggies, and I incorporate them into every meal of my day. Whether they\u2019re grilled, sauteed or roasted, I always try to keep it colorful. And this might be cliche, but I always have my Healthyish baking kits handy, and probably coffee. It\u2019s my kryptonite. I take it with a little bit of sugar and a little bit of milk, piping hot, and just a regular cup of Folgers, nothing fancy. That\u2019s my go-to every morning.What constitutes a perfect day off for you?I\u2019ve always been an early riser, so I like to get up, go outside, walk my dog a little bit, and make a really big breakfast. I\u2019m a carb lover so I load up on pancakes or French toast and go on a really long hike. I live in Vail, and I love how scenic it is. I love to do a hike called Berry Picker, which is probably one of the most challenging hikes, but you feel the most accomplished when you do it. It starts at the base of Lions Head and you literally climb up Vail mountain. There\u2019s a little restaurant at the top and you can get lunch, some wine, and ride the gondola down for free.How do you get a moment of clarity on a super stressful day?When you\u2019re really stressed out it\u2019s nice to go outside, get some fresh air and hit the reset button. I\u2019m a huge advocate of taking five\u2014there are times when I feel like I\u2019m down the rabbit hole and being pulled in 100 directions and it\u2019s so helpful to take five minutes for breathing exercises, a glass of water, or a walk. When you step away for a few moments, you can think things through with a more logical and rational approach.Explore Bon App\u00e9titEntrepreneurs Run the WorldHealthyishBakeRead MoreLifestyleHow Moving to Jamaica Helped This Entrepreneur Launch Her Travel BrandBy Ali FrancisRecipes you want to make.
