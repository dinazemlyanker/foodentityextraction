Just don\u2019t add more than a couple of tablespoons\u2014too much alcohol will cause the sorbet to melt faster. This recipe is part of the 2020 Healthyish Farmers Market Challenge.

Pour peach mixture into a loaf pan (a metal pan will conduct cold more efficiently than tempered glass) and place a piece of parchment paper on top, pressing directly onto surface. Freeze until sorbet is firm, about 6 hours.Step 2A little before serving, lightly crush half of the blackberries in a small bowl. Add lemon juice, remaining berries, and remaining 2 Tbsp. honey and let sit, tossing occasionally, until berries have released some of their juices, about 20 minutes.Step 3Scoop sorbet into bowls and top with macerated blackberries.Step 4Do Ahead: Sorbet can be made 3 days ahead. Keep frozen. Thaw in refrigerator 30 minutes before scooping into bowls.How would you rate Peach Sorbet with Crushed Blackberries?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (12)Back to TopTriangleIs there a way to make this without alcohol?Sarah JOakland, CA8/12/2021Already rated this recipe once with 5 stars. Just wanted to make an additional comment that keeps the rating at 5 stars: Made it with fresh picked strawberries and increased the vodka to 1/2 cup. Still excellent as ever! Sharing this recipe with EVERYONE! As a side note after reading some of the comments. Use RIPE fresh fruit if you want the best taste!KattaWilkes-Barre, PA7/3/2021I think  an additional step is necessary to make a smoother consistency- suggest after blending all ingredients- strain the mixture thru a fine mesh strainer. . TSinDenver,CO4/9/2021This recipe is HEAVENLY! I've been sharing it with everyone! Notice I didn't say I was sharing the Sorbet!\n I  used frozen Chambersburg peaches from this awesome place in Pennsylvania. I also used Peach Vodka and increased the amount to a little over 3 Tablespoons. If you let it soften in the refrigerator like the recipe calls for, it is perfection. It's going to taste even better when I make it over the summer!KattaWilkes-Barre, PA2/28/2021A few things with this. After I read the notes about iciness I decided to churn this in a mixer for 20min and added a little more vodka in hopes of avoiding that issue. Mine still turned out quite dense and with some ice crystals, it's hard to totally avoid with sorbet but this didn't turn out great.\n\nThe flavor was kind of lacking too. Maybe I needed riper fruit, but the honey really overpowered any fruit flavor. So use a very mild honey or maybe replace the honey with sugar to give the sorbet more body and fix the iciness too.bigmoodNew York9/4/2020I\u2019m somewhat lactose intolerant, so I subbed out the yogurt for dairy-free yogurt and the texture was .... off. The flavor is great, but it\u2019s icy and not scoop-able. \nIf I try this recipe again, I\u2019ll try adding more vodka to prevent it from freezing too much. And maybe I\u2019ll get a little buzz \ud83e\udd2aAnonymousChicago, IL8/25/2020This sorbet tastes great, but the texture came out totally wrong--it is very icy, not smooth at all. Should I have added more vodka?AnonymousNew York8/19/2020Can I use gin or tequila if I don't have vodka?Anonymous8/17/2020You have to peel chop then freeze the peaches before you start? AnonymousBaltimore 7/26/2020This sounds so good - I don\u2019t have full fat yogurt, would it work with low-fat yogurt?AnonymousKenmore WA4/13/2020Recipe is very simple and easy but wayyy too much honey. If you are not a honey lover I wouldn\u2019t recommend this unless you can substitute it for something else or just use less. Anonymous9/26/2019So easy but so delicious!  I shared with a friend and she immediately asked for the recipe.  I'll definitely be making it again too.  The addition of the blackberry sauce elevated the dessert to another level.
