Recipes vary family to family and some may include saffron. \u00a0This version is adapted from my cookbook, Let's Eat. \u2014Zaynab IssaAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Add tea bags, cardamom, cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla extract and return to a boil. Stir in evaporated milk and return to a boil again, watching carefully to ensure the tea doesn\u2019t boil over. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thick, creamy, and caramel in color, about 30 minutes. (The longer the tea simmers the stronger and creamier it will be.)Step 2Strain tea through a fine-mesh sieve into mugs; discard spices and tea bags.Adapted from LET'S EAT by Zaynab Issa.

Does this mean that I should smash the pods, or that I should remove the seeds from the pods and smash them? It would release much more flavor if the seeds were removed and cracked.AnonymousHalifax, Nova Scotia 1/27/2022I don't care for the taste of evaporated milk but whole milk works just fine. I like to add a few cracked peppercorns to the mix along with some star anise. CarswellCanada12/6/2021Delish recipe. And it perfumes the whole apartment. I'll add a couple whole cloves or star anise on occasion. GA ChristensenChicago, IL7/26/2021This is my favorite chai drink. I am now buying evaporated milk to make this. Sometimes I add whole cloves too. Yummy!  So much better than mixtures from spice shops. Amy SpiegelSanta Monica, CA6/2/2021The best easy drink I\u2019ve had. I used a store brand (read: cheap!) breakfast blend black tea and it was delicious. AnonymousMN5/27/2021This recipe is great - I used whole milk instead of evaporated and it still tasted deliciousHannahDallas, Texas5/26/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titHot DrinkDrinks AllIndianSouth AsianAsianCardamomHerbs & SpicesCinnamonEasy5 Ingredients or FewerDrinksVegetarianNut-FreeGluten-FreeKetoNonalcoholicRamadanRecipes you want to make.
