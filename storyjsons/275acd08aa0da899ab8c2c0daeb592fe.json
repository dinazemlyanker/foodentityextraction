According to Grub Street, the city's first dog caf\u00e9 will have a soft opening in mid-January before opening for good later this month.Boris & Horton, located at 12th Street and Avenue A in Manhattan's East Village and named after owners Coppy Holzman and Logan Mikhly's dogs, will offer a much-needed space for dog owners to hang out with their furry and human friends while grabbing a cup of coffee and a bite to eat. Instead of tying their pets' leashes to a nearby pole or tree while quickly running inside to grab a coffee, as is the rule at other caf\u00e9s, Boris & Horton customers will be able to bring their dogs inside with them. \"We want it to feel as much as possible like your typical coffee shop, but you have the added benefit of hanging out with your dog,\" Holzman told Grub Street.To be clear, this dog caf\u00e9 isn't the canine counterpart to the Japanese-style cat caf\u00e9s that have started popping up around the U.S. While those spaces are typically filled with (usually adoptable) cats just waiting to be played with, Boris & Horton is strictly bring-your-own-dog\u2014although, there's technically nothing stopping dog-less dog-lovers from stopping by to play with the pups who are already hanging out with their owners at the caf\u00e9.Boris & Horton will be divided into two Health Department-approved sections: The caf\u00e9 side will offer a selection of pastries from Balthazar, Bien Cuit, and the gluten-free Husk Bakeshop, City of Saints coffee, house-made toasts, and, in the evening, a beer and wine menu. The \"dog side\" will feature a seating area, a shop filled with canine-related goods, a \"puppy Instagram booth,\" and weekend dog adoption events. Visitors to the \"dog side\" will be expected to follow Boris & Horton's house rules, which are listed on the caf\u00e9's website and prohibit off-leash play, \"humping and mounting,\" bringing in more than two dogs per person, and dangerous or disruptive behavior.As long as Boris & Horton's patrons\u2014of the two- and four-legged variety\u2014follow the rules, NYC's first dog caf\u00e9 is sure to be a hit with guests of all species. \"It's not just a coffee shop where people sit there with headphones on their laptops,\" Holzman said. \"Dogs sort of break the ice.\"Another way to break the ice...Explore Bon App\u00e9titTrendsTrends + NewsNew YorkRecipes you want to make.
