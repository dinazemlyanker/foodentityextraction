Each week, you\u2019ll hear from one of them, from a line cook in Denver to a farmer in Winters, California. This week\u2019s diarist is Jenny Feldt, who recently left her bartending and beverage consulting job to resume her role as a brand ambassador for Grey Goose.Moving during COVID isn\u2019t necessarily something that I\u2019d recommend\u2014much less moving twice\u2014but when there\u2019s a pandemic and so little is in your control, it felt like the right thing to do for my sanity. Initially, I was working as a brand ambassador for Grey Goose in Atlanta, but last August the company furloughed a number of employees, including me. When that happened I decided to return home to D.C. to work as a beverage consultant, which is how I ended up at Prost. It was nice to return to my roots, training bartenders and creating a beverage program.The last few months at Prost required a lot of thinking on our toes. And with everything that has been going on in D.C., we took things one day at a time. The ban on indoor dining went into effect at the beginning of January, so we had to find creative ways to drive to-go sales and amp up outdoor seating, which is definitely challenging when temperatures drop below freezing. Cocktails can help, though, and we made sure that Prost\u2019s three signature warm cocktails weren\u2019t just specials that appeared every so often on menus but ready to rock and roll at all times.Even when you\u2019re making drinks that customers love, being a bartender during a pandemic is difficult. In the service industry it\u2019s crucial to be able to understand your guests, anticipate their wants, and get a sense of what kind of experience they\u2019re looking for. Everyone is different\u2014some folks want a super-curated, personalized cocktail whereas others just want a beer, some food, and to be left alone. But you can only figure that out by having some interaction with them.During the pandemic that all disappeared. I had to depend on servers to get a feel for guests, and I just made cocktails according to my recipes. I still managed to find ways to connect. I would send out handwritten notes with to-go orders or write a story or history of the cocktail on the chalkboard to interact with customers at even the most basic level.Photo by Jose PereiroBut in the end I knew my time at Prost would be short. I had always planned to return to Grey Goose. I\u2019ve been in Atlanta for about a month now, and it\u2019s a completely different environment than D.C. For one, indoor dining is almost at full capacity, so restaurants are in full swing for the most part. But that in no way means that things are back to normal or that the industry is not struggling here. We\u2019re working on ways to modify service in order to ensure guests and employees will feel safe and comfortable dining out.At Grey Goose things are a little different than before. A big part of my job is focused on marketing Grey Goose across the southeastern part of the country. In normal times I would be traveling everywhere from Georgia to Tennessee not only to teach bartenders about Grey Goose but also categories of vodka, ways to grow as a bartender, you name it. Now that we\u2019re dealing with the pandemic, a lot of that takes place through Zoom.No two days are the same for me. I\u2019m responsible for building relationships with different restaurants and bartenders across the region, so I\u2019m able to keep a finger on the pulse. I hear how they\u2019re accessing PPE, how they\u2019re leveraging PPP loans, and whether or not they could use financial help. I\u2019m also working on a big mental health initiative at Grey Goose to raise awareness about how difficult this time is for the industry and to also host a series of check-ins.Having a salaried role at Grey Goose is much more stable than gambling on a more traditional service industry job. At this point I don\u2019t know if I can see myself hopping behind the bar full-time anytime soon, given the volatility of what\u2019s going on and of course how different the job is today than it was a year ago.And while I\u2019m spending less time behind the bar, I\u2019m actually interacting more with bartenders on a day-to-day basis than I thought I would. Being around other creative souls brings a sense of community and drive. I\u2019ve been so happy to see much more collaboration throughout different cities, whether through scheduled Grey Goose virtual meet-ups or random check-ins. This has given me a real sense of hope that we will come out of this stronger, and certainly more empathetic, than before.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsRestaurant DiariesFirst PersonRecipes you want to make.
