And they surely are not in his latest show, The Gilded Age, or his new film, Downton Abbey: A New Era either. Here the author, screenwriter, director, baron, and member of the UK\u2019s House of Lords reveals who he\u2019d have at his own fantasy fete.You have two period pieces out now which focus on English and New York society, respectively. Which group of characters would you prefer to party with?New York would have been more fun. At the time the ways of the English were all quite settled and seemingly low-energy. But in New York, Mrs. Astor had forged this new society, mixing the old families and the old money with the new arrivals who came with great fortunes and built their palaces up and down Fifth Avenue. Their parties, with people like Alva Vanderbilt and Jay Gould, would have been pretty good fun.If you could invite any three people\u2014dead or alive\u2014who would they be and why?Apart from my wife, of course, I\u2019d have to invite Marilyn Monroe. The thing about movie stars is in order to be emotionally moving, they must convey a sense of needing the viewer\u2019s help. Marilyn had that more than anyone. You wanted to get her safely through the story. I\u2019d also invite Ella Fitzgerald, my all-time favorite singer. There was mastery in the way she took possession of a song. I\u2019d also like to learn what it was like to be a Black woman who was a huge star at a time of ubiquitous racist persecution. Like the time she was traveling to Australia for one of her greatest tours, and she and her companions were thrown off the plane. The third guest would be novelist Anthony Trollope. I\u2019m president of the Trollope Society, and while many look down on him, as if he were writing soap operas instead of proper dramas, I believe he had a much more modern take on people. His heroines were never all good\u2014they\u2019re not Dickens\u2019s sainted angels wearing white\u2014and his villains were never all bad.Like Thomas Barrow from Downton Abbey, a perfect villain. Where do you host?In my dining room in Dorset, with its long table and Gothic chairs. We\u2019d use the china with the family crest and turquoise trim, and the room would be lit with silver candlesticks.\u00a0What do you serve?We\u2019d start with ice-chilled vichyssoise, followed by coronation chicken, a cold dish with a sauce made out of cream, mayonnaise, apricot jam, onions, and curry. It was invented for the present queen\u2019s coronation and is absolutely delicious. For pudding, crepes Suzette with Cointreau in it, served with a glass of Beaumes-de-Venise.What\u2019s the opening conversation starter?These guests and I have been up against people who didn\u2019t believe in us. Producer Darryl Zanuck and others didn\u2019t think Monroe was really an actress. Ella Fitzgerald was rejected by the establishment. I\u2019ve had my material dismissed by many. You have to find your own faith in yourself. When I meet young people who are in a similar situation, I say to them, \u201cStay away from those who don\u2019t believe in you. Later on, when your career has fallen into place, you can pick them up again. But in the beginning, there is a limit to how much negativity you can withstand.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titDream Dinner PartyPop CultureInterviewsRecipes you want to make.
