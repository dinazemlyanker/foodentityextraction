Though technically you could replace the aged cacha\u00e7a in this cocktail with the more commonly available unaged variety, we strongly recommend you source the good stuff. Aged cacha\u00e7a spends time in oak barrels, resulting in all of the warm spice flavors we crave in the winter. This recipe is from Montreal\u2019s cozy-cool coffee-pizza-wine restaurant Elena.Ingredients8 servings1cup plus 2 Tbsp. bourbon1cup plus 2 Tbsp. aged cacha\u00e7a (such as Avu\u00e1 Amburana)\u00becup Averna amaro\u00becup fresh lemon juice\u2154cup honeyLarge pinch of kosher saltLemon wedges (for serving)PreparationGently heat bourbon, cacha\u00e7a, amaro, lemon juice, honey, salt, and 4\u00bd cups water in a medium saucepan over medium-low until hot but not boiling.
