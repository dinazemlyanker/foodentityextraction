While my health-conscious friends try paleo, Whole30, and low-carb regimens, such restrictive measures put me off. If they don\u2019t work, I\u2019ve deprived myself for no good reason. Worse, if they produced great results, I\u2019d feel like I\u2019d never get to indulge in my favorite things (pasta! cheese! wine!) with abandon again. I\u2019m probably not alone, given the recent flurry of interest around intermittent fasting (IF), a schedule of eating as opposed to a true diet. Advocates say simply changing your \u201cfeeding window\u201d can boost metabolism, give the digestive system time to rest and promote lean muscle growth. If it worked for Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Aniston, and Miranda Kerr and won\u2019t keep me from an occasional dessert, I wanted to know more.What is IF and why should one consider it?Fasting is any time you abstain from eating. It\u2019s why our morning meal is called breakfast, literally breaking the fast after sleeping. IF strategically stretches that period. Two popular methods include the 16:8, with 16 calorie-free hours followed by eight hours of normal eating, and the 5:2, with two restricted days of approximately 500 calories interspersed among five normal calorie days.The potential benefits as a weight-loss strategy are compelling, says Jennifer McDaniel, a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN). \u201cSome researchers have shown that losing weight by IF can help preserve lean body mass and potentially be a more sustainable approach compared to chronic calorie cutting.\u201d McDaniel, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, adds that studies have shown that IF may also reduce certain risk factors for heart disease, improve memory, lower risk for Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s and lower systemic inflammation. The theory behind this is that when the body is in a fasting state, it stops producing as many growth hormones and proteins and can repair cells.But isn\u2019t breakfast the most important meal of the day?\u201cMedically there's actually no requirement whatsoever,\u201d explains Dr. Jason Fung, a Toronto-based M.D. and author of The Complete Guide to Fasting. \u201cWhen you don't eat, your body simply switches from burning food to burning body fat and sugar.\u201d For a non-morning person like me, not eating until noon means one less reason to rush first thing. I like it already.But I work out. Is that safe?\u201cIntermittent fasting helps with the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass, which is the opposite of what you'd think,\u201d says Amanda Tress, founder of the FASTer Way to Fat Loss, a six-week online program built around IF. Before discovering fasting, the Florida-based mom of three struggled with high blood pressure and adrenal fatigue. She adjusted her diet and became a personal trainer, but she noticed that even clients who ate well and hit the gym regularly weren\u2019t always seeing desired results. \u201cI started experimenting with IF, and people started burning fat like you wouldn\u2019t believe,\u201d she says.Fung echoes those sentiments. \u201cYour body has a giant store of calories. One pound of fat is roughly 3,500 calories, so most people have at least 10 [or more] pounds just sitting in our bodies. If you need it, your body will use it.\u201dBut I feel hungry.Eating every few hours is a habit for most, and we\u2019re bombarded with ads and images of mouth-watering food almost constantly [I dare you to scroll through the BA recipes and not feel famished]. \u201cIt's not fun, but you can give your body the instruction it's okay to not eat,\u201d Fung says. Staying properly hydrated is vital since dehydration can masquerade as hunger. Bored with plain water? Tress recommends adding lemon juice or drinking tea. Black coffee is also allowed in moderation. \u201cYou could try some bone broth or kombucha, as long as you stay under about 50 calories,\u201d she says.It\u2019s not for everyone.There are certain groups who shouldn\u2019t try fasting, intermittent or otherwise, including women who are pregnant, trying to conceive or breastfeeding or anyone with a history of eating disorders. \u201cIf you have a history of thyroid issues, consult your physician before following an IF protocol as it may interfere with thyroid hormone production,\u201d McDaniel adds.IF might get easier.In this food-loving writer\u2019s experience, strategies for success help, but there\u2019s no replacement for old-fashioned willpower. Initially, all I could think about was Vietnamese coffee and eggs, and I don\u2019t even like eggs that much. I drank my pitiful water and forged ahead. Fast forward a few weeks and instead of restriction, IF feels like freedom. I don't have to think about scarfing down breakfast before my first meeting, and I have better mental clarity. I think I may have found my non-diet diet of choice.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishTrendsRead MoreshoppingI Eat Dinner at 4 p.m. and Trust Me It\u2019s GreatBy Jennifer Still Recipes you want to make.
