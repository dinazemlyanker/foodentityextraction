There are 20 seats inside, tucked around a wood bar\u2014but if the weather ever warms up, those 20 seats will become 60, spilling out onto the stone patio of Bow Market in Somerville, MA. For now, they\u2019ve got blankets to wrap yourself in while you wait outside for a seat, and indoors, you can sit under a pink-lit wall emblazoned with the words SEX MONEY POWER and sip a glass of Gaia Quoi, a joyful, fizz-pop, deep-berry pet nat Syrah... It is, as Lauren Friel says, \u201ca handshake wine,\u201d one that tastes like better things are coming.Friel, the 35-year-old owner of Rebel Rebel, which she describes as a \u201cfeminist natural wine bar,\u201d likes her tight quarters because she likes keeping an eye on people. Rebel Rebel\u2019s website instructs guests to leave their \u201cmisogyny, homophobia, racism, classism, ableism, patriarchy, [and] gender bias\u201d at the door. \u201cI try to make it apparent from the time someone walks in the door that this is what\u2019s happening,\u201d says Friel. \u201cThere were a lot of people who were like, Do you really need that \u2018Donate to Planned Parenthood\u2019 jar on the bar?\u201d She wasn\u2019t deterred. \u201cI wanted to build something in my city that I can be proud of. I knew in my heart of hearts that if I want it, other people probably want it, too. \u201dShe was right: Rebel Rebel has been reliably packed since its opening in late 2018. It\u2019s one of a growing number of female-owned establishments like wine bars haley.henry and nath\u00e1lie and natural wine shop The Wine Bottega that show how Boston is shifting the needle on its image as a town for beers and (predominately white) bros in Vineyard Vines.Centering women\u2019s experiences and approaches is something that Friel learned early in her career. She started working as a restaurant server after college, working under Ana Sortun and Theresa Paopao at Oleana. When Paopao left, she urged Friel to apply for the job of wine director. \u201cThey actually hired someone else after Theresa left who didn\u2019t end up working out,\u201d Friel says. \u201cOne day I walked in, and the owners handed me the wine laptop and said, \u2018We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. Can you figure it out?\u2019\u201dFriel with a bottle of Martha Stouman's Negroamaro Rosato.\nPhoto by Buck Harlan SquibbShe learned on the job. \u201cI\u2019d never seen an inventory spreadsheet, I didn\u2019t know what the labels meant, but I have the palate, and I love to research\u2014I went to school for journalism. I found an old blog post written by Levi Dalton called \u2018101 Things Every New Wine Buyer Should Know\u2019 and I referred to it constantly. That was my rubric.\u201dEventually, she\u2019d go on to get certification through the Wine and Spirits Education Trust, and at Oleana, her wine program won both Wine Enthusiast's 100 Best Wine Restaurants Award and Boston Magazine's Best of Boston award. As a consultant, she designed the country\u2019s only all-female wine list for New York\u2019s Dirt Candy. Yet despite her experience, she still struggled to be taken seriously.\u201cWhen I first started as a wine professional in 2011, I was frequently the only woman in the room, and absolutely the youngest by at least a decade,\u201d she says. \u201cA very common reaction from guests was, \u2018No no, we wanted to speak to the wine director.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018No no, I am the wine director\u2019.\u201d And while she\u2019s happy to see change occurring across the industry, creating female-friendly spaces in the wine industry remains an uphill battle.Disagreements between natural wine purveyors and traditionalists frequently spill over into personal attacks, she says. \u201cIt\u2019ll escalate and escalate, and things will stay in the context of wine, until some kind of threat of sexual assault or body shaming becomes their trump card. I\u2019ve had that happen many times, both online and in person. It\u2019s so tired, and it\u2019s so obvious, and it\u2019s so boring, but it\u2019s so common.\u201dThe bar at Rebel Rebel.\nPhoto by Buck Harlan SquibbWhat has also gone largely addressed is the treatment of female buyers by male producers, many of whom have a reputation for being \u201cloose cannons.\u201d On a recent visit to France, one producer was \u201cshowing a lot of attention toward the female buyers,\u201d Friel recounts. \u201cMyself and a few other women were like, we\u2019re not playing this game.\u201dSo Rebel Rebel was always intended to be the antithesis of all this\u2014the sexist comments, the pervasive harassment, the intellectual diminishment. From the mostly queer, all-female-identifying staff (\u201cthat\u2019s not intentional, we\u2019ve just only ever had one guy apply\u201d) to the carefully curated selection of natural wines that line her open shelves, she\u2019s been vehement about crafting a space that honors what she loves about wine.\u201cWe decided on all natural wines for two reasons,\u201d Friel says. \u201cFirst, the damage that conventional, industrial wine making does to the environment is terrifying, frankly. The other is that natural wine, because it always has been kinda scrappy, is more inclusive of young people, women, people of color, and queer people. It\u2019s also just more fun.\u201dHer neon yellow acrylics tapdance along the rows as she pulls a liter bottle of \u00c8 Rosato, a Piedmontese ros\u00e9 made by the third-generation \u201clunatic, warm, goofy\u201d winemaker Fausto Cellario. \u201cHis wines are always brilliant and pure and precise,\u201d Friel says. The wine is an intense, plush pink, and tastes like \u201cthe warm, squishy strawberries that get crushed at the bottom of your bag.\u201d It is satisfying and fresh while still carefully architectural\u2014as Friel says, a bit of magic.\u201cPeople who have been in the industry for a long time say this\u2014it\u2019s not just me being woowoo\u2014there are certain wines, really important wines, and they won\u2019t be doing it for me, and then I meet the person and it\u2019s like, Oh, that\u2019s why. You suck!\u201d That\u2019s why she\u2019s careful to stock her shelves with wine made only by \u201cawesome people doing awesome things.\u201dRebel Rebel is a temple to the wine Friel loves, but it\u2019s also just a really chill place to drink really good wine. As Friel says, \u201cI can\u2019t participate in anything anymore that isn\u2019t actively progressing our social situation to a place of equality and understanding and empathy, especially when there\u2019s money involved. It doesn\u2019t feel right.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishBostonnatural wineprofileRead MoreLifestyleKrista Scruggs Is Making the Most Exciting, Most Delicious Natural Wine Right NowBy Marissa A.
