Instead of rubbing toast with cut tomatoes, we grated the tomatoes to make a raw sauce that the bread can really absorb.Ingredients4 servings1ciabatta loaf3Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling2garlic cloves, halved crosswise2lb. heirloom tomatoes, coredFlaky sea saltFreshly ground black pepper, chopped oregano, and/or oil-packed anchovy fillets (for serving; optional)PreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 300\u00b0. Holding a bread knife so it\u2019s parallel with work surface, slice ciabatta in half lengthwise (like opening a book). Slice each piece in half lengthwise down the center, then cut each strip on a diagonal into 4 pieces (you should have 16 pieces total).Step 2Drizzle 3 Tbsp. oil over bread and rub each piece to evenly distribute oil. Place bread on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until lightly browned and dried out, 30\u201340 minutes. Rub warm toast with cut sides of garlic; set aside.Step 3Meanwhile, slice a thin round off the bottom of each tomato. Starting at cut end, grate tomatoes on the largest holes of a grater into a medium bowl until all that\u2019s left are the flattened tomato skins. Finely chop skins and mix into grated flesh; season very generously with salt.Step 4Spoon a generous amount of tomato sauce over each toast (you may have some left over). Let sit at least a minute or two so bread can absorb some of the juices. Drizzle with oil, sprinkle with more salt, and top as desired.How would you rate Pan con Tomate?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (3)Back to TopTriangleFor something so easy, I got a ton of compliments.
