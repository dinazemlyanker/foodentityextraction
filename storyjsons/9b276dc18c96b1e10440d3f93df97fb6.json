There are many versions of the dish yielding different textures and flavors, but my recipe calls for just three ingredients: eggs, rehydrated dried shiitake mushrooms, and hon-dashi, or instant dashi powder. This recipe serves 4 as part of a larger meal, but you can easily make a snack-size portion using fewer eggs. I like to eat it with plain steamed rice and a stir-fried vegetable or as a side with congee.To make steamed eggs at home you\u2019ll need a lidded pot that can fit a steaming rack or basket, or a Tatung steamer (a piece of equipment I can\u2019t live without)\u2014plus a heatproof bowl. I suggest serving your perfectly jiggly eggs topped with a touch of soy sauce, chili crisp, and scallions to brighten them up, but you can be creative and experiment with XO sauce, black vinegar, and sacha sauce as well. \u2014Jessie YuChenAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a heatproof serving bowl (you will steam and serve from this bowl) to remove bubbles. Using a spoon, skim off any remaining bubbles, then gently sprinkle mushrooms over egg mixture.Step 4Place a steaming rack or basket in a large pot with a lid (make sure your bowl will fit in the pot when covered with lid). Pour in water to come 2\" up sides of pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat. If using a Tatung steamer instead, add 1 cup water to steamer.Step 5Carefully place bowl with egg mixture into steamer and cover immediately, leaving lid slightly askew for steam to escape. Reduce heat to medium-low and steam, adjusting heat as needed to keep water at a gentle boil, until egg mixture is set and jiggly when shaken, 12\u201315 minutes. If using a Tatung steamer, place bowl with egg mixture in steamer and cover with lid, propping open with a folded paper towel.
