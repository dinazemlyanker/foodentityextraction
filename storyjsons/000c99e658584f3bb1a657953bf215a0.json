And honestly, I\u2019m not mad about it: Those crispy griddled patties glossed with American cheese have a special kind of magic. Still, I\u2019ll always hold a torch for a decidedly different kind of burger: the drippy, French onion soup-inspired burger at Father\u2019s Office in Santa Monica.If the concept of a French onion soup burger doesn\u2019t sell you right away, you might as well close this tab. Just kidding, stay for the details: an 8-ounce dry-aged chuck patty topped with applewood bacon, arugula, onions caramelized in bacon fat, and both Gruy\u00e8re and blue cheese, all piled on an oblong French roll. Yes, it\u2019s messy. Yes, it\u2019s a little dated. (Father\u2019s Office has been serving up this burger since 2000.) And yes, my stomach hurts after wolfing down the whole thing in a matter of minutes. But also: None of that matters because the Office Burger is perfect.Chef Sang Yoon has dialed in every single detail. The loosely ground chuck patty is juicy but not fall-apart sloppy. The arugula offsets the fatty bacon and double whammy of lactose, and the bacon-y onions are just as delicious as you\u2019d expect them to be. The whole burger comes together in indulgent harmony, keeping you coming back for another bite until suddenly you\u2019re left with an empty plate and uncomfortably tight pants.Now is probably the time to mention Father\u2019s Office has an infamous no-substitutions-allowed policy. And to prevent customers from taking matters into their own hands, there\u2019s no ketchup on the premises. (Not even for fries, which instead come with a small dish of aioli.) But after 20 years and expanding to three locations\u2014even in the undeniable age of smash burger supremacy\u2014what might have been L.A.\u2019s first \u201cgourmet burger\u201d remains unchanged. And that\u2019s exactly how I like it.Go there: Father\u2019s OfficeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsLos AngelesSanta MonicaBurgersRecipes you want to make.
