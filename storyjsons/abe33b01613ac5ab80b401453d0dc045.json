They permeate the flesh, giving it a nutty flavor, and serve as both a shield to protect the flesh and a beautiful platter. But we've simplified things so you can grill the fish in a foil packet. Don\u2019t fret if you can\u2019t find turbot. Look out for other flatfish such as Dover sole or flounder. For a long, lazy lunch menu serve this fish alongside sea bream crudo, tomatoes and haricots verts, handmade malfatti, and tiramis\u00f9 with cookies.Ingredients8 servings 2whole turbot (about 3 lb. each), heads and fins removed, split in half along the backbone1\u00bccups extra-virgin olive oil, dividedKosher salt8sprigs rosemary, divided1\u00bdcups finely chopped parsley\u00bdcup finely chopped celery leaves1garlic clove, finely grated\u00bdlemon\u00bdtsp. Aleppo-style or other mild red pepper flakesFreshly ground black pepperAioli or store-bought mayonnaise (for serving)PreparationStep 1Prepare a grill for medium-low indirect heat (for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off; for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill). Tear off 4 large sheets of foil. Rub fish with \u00bd cup oil (2 Tbsp. per piece) and season with salt. Working one at a time, place a fillet in the center of a sheet of foil and top with 2 rosemary sprigs. Fold in short sides of foil over fish, then fold in long sides and roll edges together to seal.Step 2Place pouches on cool side of grill, cover grill, and cook fish, turning once, 20\u201325 minutes. Open a pouch to check fish. Flesh should be slightly opaque and the tip of a knife should slide through easily. Grill a little longer if needed.Step 3Meanwhile, combine parsley, celery leaves, and garlic in a medium bowl. Finely zest lemon into bowl, then squeeze in juice. Add red pepper flakes and mix in remaining \u00be cup oil; season with salt and black pepper. Let salsa verde sit 10 minutes for flavors to come together.Step 4Transfer fish to a platter and serve with salsa verde and aioli.How would you rate Grilled Turbot with Celery Leaf Salsa Verde?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkExplore Bon App\u00e9titFishSeafoodSoleFlounderCeleryVegetableEasyMainGluten-FreeNut-FreeKetoHealthyishGrillingDinnerRecipes you want to make.
