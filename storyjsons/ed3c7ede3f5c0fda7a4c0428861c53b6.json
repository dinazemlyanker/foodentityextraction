This month, Jessamine Chan, author of The School for Good Mothers, recounts her tumultuous breastfeed journey\u2014and the rituals she developed to cope.There's a photo that captures my first weeks of motherhood, but it\u2019s too embarrassing to publish. I\u2019m sitting on a folding chair at the top of the stairs in a narrow hallway. The TV tray in front of me holds a pile of Chinese food. I\u2019m pouting, my body curled small with my arms crossed tight, posed like a kid in time-out.\u00a0My parents, who\u2019d come to Philadelphia to help with the baby, wanted me to follow the postpartum Chinese principles of confinement or \u201czuo yue zi,\u201d which, according to my father, translates from Mandarin to \u201csitting still indoors for a month.\u201d During this period of rest, a new mother is fed special foods, such as rich chicken soup perfumed with ginger and wine or bone broths laced with plump red dates. The meals aim to promote blood flow, restore qi, and most important for me, increase milk production.My C-section had left me bedridden, so I was stuck upstairs, eagerly awaiting the exquisite dishes my father prepared. But my appetite while nursing far outpaced my father\u2019s cooking. I craved filling, starchy sweets, like chocolate babka from the local bakery. I felt so loved but so hungry. And despite my family\u2019s efforts, confinement hadn\u2019t solved my milk problem.In the hospital I\u2019d learned that my C-section had slowed the natural process of lactation. As a result I wasn\u2019t producing enough milk for my daughter to gain weight. Every two hours I nursed and pumped, praying my body would cooperate. My inadequate supply drew the attention of a parade of medical personnel\u2014especially the lactation consultant who, along with a litany of corrections, matter-of-factly noted my baby\u2019s shallow latch and how I wasn\u2019t holding her properly. The consultant meant well, but I was crushed. Due to pregnancy-related carpal tunnel syndrome, my arms and hands felt electrified with pain, so even holding my baby was excruciating.Without the right latch, my daughter wouldn\u2019t get enough nutrients from my milk. If she didn\u2019t get enough nutrients, I\u2019d have to supplement with formula. And if I didn\u2019t agree to use formula, I might need to leave her at the hospital until she reached a healthy weight.I wanted to scream. But I was too anxious and sleep-deprived to do even that. Nothing had gone according to plan. I didn\u2019t breathe through my contractions. I didn\u2019t surrender to the pain. I didn\u2019t have a natural birth. And now I couldn\u2019t provide my baby with the milk she needed to thrive. I\u2019d arrived at motherhood consumed with big-picture worries: whether I\u2019d raise a confident daughter, what values I\u2019d impart, if I\u2019d have time to write. I hadn\u2019t expected to fail so soon.Going home without her wasn\u2019t an option. That night I cranked the breast pump to its highest setting, willing myself to ignore the pain. I didn\u2019t care about hurting myself. If they needed me to try harder, I\u2019d keep trying until I broke my body.The effortless breastfeeding journey is rare. According to a study by Pediatrics, only 8 percent of women nurse easily within the first days of motherhood. Yet no one at the hospital mentioned the commonness of my experience. Similarly, my parents\u2014despite their good intentions\u2014didn\u2019t explain why confinement was beneficial or necessary. \u201cSitting the month\u201d is an opportunity to convalesce after the trauma of birth, to be doted upon and protected. You aren\u2019t supposed to feel trapped.On the flip side, new mothers in America are often characterized as tireless superwomen who \u201cdo it all.\u201d While I understood this to be a fantasy too, I still wanted to be capable and independent. Already hemmed in by the rules of postsurgical recovery, I didn\u2019t want any more limits. I yearned to make decisions for myself, to discover my own maternal instincts.The School for Good MothersChan\u2019s debut novel, The School for Good Mothers, is out now.$23 at Amazon$25 at Bookshop.orgThough I\u2019d brought my daughter home, her weight was still being monitored, along with my milk supply. So I rotated through a flurry of homeopathic tricks. I drank mother\u2019s milk tea until I reeked of fenugreek. I increased my calorie intake until I was consuming enough food for a family of five. When none of that worked, I did what anyone does in times of stress\u2014I turned to the internet. I needed to find a different kind of stillness, on my own terms.Deep in mommy-blog-land, I discovered lactation cookies: chocolaty oatmeal biscuits made with magical milk-stimulating brewer\u2019s yeast. I\u2019m prediabetic, so sweets of any kind are rare delights. Luckily enough, my sister found a recipe that used low-sugar ingredients like figs and agave, plus sprouted quinoa, flaxseed meal, and coconut oil. She baked a couple of batches, shipped them over, and soon I had a stash to last for weeks.\u00a0Each morning I hopped off the hamster wheel of newborn care long enough to eat a cookie. After changing diapers, nursing, and pumping in the afternoons, I ate another. The palm-size treats tasted nutty, rich, decadent. With this gentle ritual, I could savor a moment alone, just for myself, relishing the hope and pleasure it provided.Whether it was the cookies, pumping, or time, during my baby\u2019s first month home, my milk increased. My daughter\u2019s latch improved. She became plump. I stopped feeling guilty about supplementing with formula. My strength returned. I started taking walks. Eventually, the pain in my body subsided and I held my daughter easily. Perhaps the solution had been there all along, in the maternity ward or at the top of the stairs in my narrow hallway. Instead of doubling down when I felt pressure, I could stop pushing and let go. Accept rest as the gift that it was. Be gentle, by doing something as simple as eating cookies.I nursed my daughter for the last time on the evening of her first birthday. I dimmed the lights in her room and cradled her, feeling triumphant but knowing I\u2019d miss this singular closeness. How strange and difficult and wondrous it had been to feed her from my body, to have her need me, to provide. Her breathing slowed. Her hands relaxed. As her velvety cheek pressed against me, she closed her eyes and drank.Get the Recipe:Lactation CookiesThese nutty, chocolaty treats are perfect for anyone who\u2019s lactating\u2014and just as delicious for everyone else.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titAll on the TableCultureRecipes you want to make.
