Perhaps Sohui Kim explained it best in her book Korean Home Cooking when she shared what her father used to say: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have kimchi on the table, you\u2019re not eating well.\u201dWhat is kimchi and how is it made?The Korean Kimchi Cookbook by Kim Man-Jo, Lee O-Young, and Lee Kyou-Tae briefly delves into the history of kimchi, explaining that early records show kimchi has been around since the Goryeo Dynasty (918\u20131392 CE), though some scholars argue that kimchi's oldest variations date back much further. Harsh winters in Korea made food preservation essential, and one method consisted of salting vegetables, among other foods, and storing them underground in earthenware containers to ferment.\u00a0While there are a few ways to make kimchi, the basic approach is somewhat consistent. Your vegetable of choice (Napa cabbage, Korean radish, and cucumber are common picks) is first pickled in brine, then drained and seasoned with a paste that consists largely of gochugaru, fish sauce, and water. Other common accompanying ingredients that go into the mix include garlic, ginger, Asian pear, scallions, and salted shrimp. The seasoned veggies are then packed into an airtight container before being stored in the fridge to ferment.During the fermentation stage, the lactic acid that was first produced during the initial pickling step proliferates. According to Hooni Kim, author of My Korea, the \u201clactic acid lowers the pH of the vegetable, giving the kimchi its distinct sour flavor.\u201dWhile many definitions of kimchi include the words \u201cfermented vegetables,\u201d that\u2019s not the full story. In The Korean Kimchi Cookbook, you\u2019ll see that even squid and green persimmon can be kimchi\u2019d. The main stars of these varieties aren't vegetables, though the recipes still call for radish, carrots, or cucumbers in the vegetable mix. Bottom line: Nearly anything can be kimchi, and vegetables will almost always play the supporting role if not the main. With all the room for variation, it\u2019s no surprise then that there are well over 100 types of kimchi including the common Napa cabbage version.Recipes for kimchi can vary greatly depending on household, restaurant, and even where you are on the map. Even though raw oyster and octopus are common additions that promote bacteria growth during the fermentation process, for example, you\u2019re less likely to find them in kimchi made outside of Korea.Dive right in!\nPhoto and Food Styling by Emma FishmanHow do you eat and cook with kimchi?Kimchi has nearly as many roles as it does varieties. When eaten as a side dish, it\u2019s folded over meat or rice for a bite with a perfect medley of flavors. It\u2019s often simmered in stews like kimchi jjigae and budae jjigae, where the kimchi\u2019s biting tang and spice make for a hearty base. When braised, the reduced kimchi liquid simmers down to a concentrated flavor that\u2019ll coat meat or fish in an irresistible sauce. Soups, stews, and braises are great for using up leftover kimchi that\u2019s been sitting in the fridge for a month or two\u2014that extra sour punch is welcome. When stir-fried, kimchi mellows out, becoming the perfect base for fried rice or grains or dumpling fillings. And since kimchi itself is already bursting with flavor, you only need to add flour and water and you\u2019ve made yourself a delicious batter for kimchijeon.Chopped kimchi also works well as a garnish for hotdogs and burgers as a substitute for pickles and relish. I\u2019ve even seen bottles of kimchi seasoning mix that can replace regular ol\u2019 chile flakes on pizza, tacos, and spaghetti. But perhaps my favorite way to use kimchi is to incorporate it into cheese-heavy foods like grilled cheese sandwiches and mac and cheese. The sharp acidity cuts through the creamy cheese, giving my palate a much needed break from the heavy flavors.I always make sure to have enough kimchi on hand for a spontaneous kimchi jjigae dinner on rainy nights or to whip up a midday kimchi jeon snack in under 15 minutes. Now I don\u2019t put out a side of kimchi with all of my meals, but on days that I do, my appetite turns ravenous.Say kimcheese:One-Pot Kimchi and Squash Mac and CheeseThis is a \u201cnecessity is the mother of invention\u201d kind of recipe, born from isolation, scant ingredients, an oversupply of kimchi, and sheer hunger. Yet this unconventional one-pot approach also happens to be one of the simplest ways to prepare mac and cheese.\u00a0View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titKoreanKimchiRecipes you want to make.
