This impossibly smooth, thick, saffron-studded, I-can't-believe-I-made-this-with-yogurt treat is typical of the Indian state of Gujarat. When I'm back home in Texas, I make shrikhand with my dad\u2019s homemade yogurt, but you can get that same silkiness with good-quality store-bought Greek yogurt. In what turned out to be a real game-changer, my friend Khushbu suggested putting shrikhand in a graham cracker crust and refrigerating it, like a no-bake pie. Shrikhand pie is an excellent idea, but I'm just as happy spooning it out of the bowl as is.Excerpted from Indian-ish \u00a9 2019 by Priya Krishna with Ritu Krishna.

Place yogurt in colander and let drain in refrigerator at least 8 hours and up to 12 hours; discard drained liquid in bowl. Yogurt should be very thick\u2014like an even creamier, richer Greek yogurt.Step 2Crush \u00bc tsp. saffron threads to a powder with a mortar and pestle; transfer to a small bowl. Finely grind cardamom seeds.Step 3Transfer strained yogurt to a large bowl and mix in crushed saffron, cardamom, and sugar (yogurt should turn a pale yellow color). Top with remaining \u00bc tsp. saffron threads (don\u2019t mix, as you want that stained effect) and chill at least 2 hours and up to 8 hours before serving.How would you rate Shrikhand\u00a0?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (8)Back to TopTriangleWe also add blanched and slivered almonds and chopped pistachios. The crunchy nuts contrast nicely with the smooth shrikhand. Finely diced fresh mangoes work well too.AnonymousOrlando,Florida 11/14/2021Shrikhand originated from both Gujarat and Maharashtra. The strained yogurt is called \u201cChacca\u201d and that is what gives Shrikhand it\u2019s distinctive taste.. Back in India there are many varieties and flavors of Shrikhand. AnonymousSeattle, WA10/30/2021Priya, you\u2019ve done it again! The flavour is delicate and decadent all at once and I\u2019m going to be making this forever. AnonymousVancouver, BC8/30/2021Oh my! Delicious. L.i.s.a.Australia 7/11/2020Wow! I cheated and used thick Olympic 11% Greek yogurt (available in BC, Canada) right out of the container then added the other ingredients - it may not have been as thick as a strained yogurt but it was creamy and the combination of cardamom and saffron were delicious. Also cut the amount of sugar by half. I loved this .gerri1Vancouver, BC Canada7/9/2020Can also use a cheese cloth/muslin cloth instead of the coffee filters or paper towels - wouldn't want to waste -  jsookhaJohannesburg, South Africa7/8/2020Brilliant! I piped shrikhand into profiteroles and popped them in the fridge! Divine \ud83d\ude0bSheenaloItaly7/7/2020This is an easy and amazing summer treat! I'm Gujarati and just made this last weekend from hung, plain whole-milk yogurt. It's creamy and delicious! Love the graham cracker crust twist! It had me thinking... what about traditional Indian biscuits like Parle-G or Good Day Pistachio biscuits? That would be amazing!
