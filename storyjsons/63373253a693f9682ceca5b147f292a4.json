When it comes to hanging with my group of friends, whether we\u2019re cooking a meal together or just sitting by candlelight, talking about our days, there\u2019s usually that point in the night when I start nervously eyeing the bottle, debating whether or not I should set out to try to find more. It sends me into an anxious tizzy just thinking about it\u2014or at least it used to. Now I just bring around this liter bottle of Slovenian ros\u00e9 every time we hang out.Zajc\u2019s Cvicek is perfect for reasons other than its size, though that added 250 milliliters does mean you\u2019re getting an extra glass or two out of a single bottle. It\u2019s also only $13, which means it\u2019s rent week\u2013approved. It\u2019s low-ABV\u2014we\u2019re sitting at home not raging all night, remember?\u2014so even a few of us can sip on it without worrying about how much we\u2019ve consumed. It\u2019s super chuggable, with tons of cherry and raspberry notes (it actually kind of tastes like a melted Jolly Rancher, a good thing). Plus, it\u2019s got a screw off cap, which makes it easy to put it back in the fridge if the party ends early. Yeah, right. Like that\u2019s ever going to happen.Learn more: Zajc, Cvicek Ros\u00e9Explore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendWinenatural wineRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
