Not that I haven't impulse-bought a few during the post-Valentine\u2019s Day clearance sales, but the designated dessert of romance has long been ripe for a revamp. And it deserves one! Because chocolate-covered strawberries are a pretty perfect make-ahead dessert, especially for large groups.Luckily, Bon App\u00e9tit senior food editor Claire Saffitz made a matcha-dipped strawberry that feels totally modern\u2014not mail order. \u201cMatcha is so grassy and vegetal that it pairs really well with that sweet white chocolate,\u201d says Saffitz. Not a matcha fan? Consider this recipe an invitation for experimentation.Start your magic shell by combining chopped white chocolate and melted virgin coconut oil in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water, which helps the chocolate melt smoothly and evenly. Then mix in a powder like matcha or freeze-dried fruit pulverized in a blender for added color and flavor. When the chocolate mixture is nearly smooth, remove it from the heat and stir until the chocolate is totally melted, then chill it in a bowl of ice water and stir until it's thicker and starting to lose its sheen. If the mixture gets too thick and hardens, just remelt it.The chocolate mixture sticks best to cold, dry fruit, so avoid using wet berries or fruit with cut edges. We recommend chilled stem-on strawberries, cherries, or frozen bananas. Just make sure to pat your fruit dry, then dip into the chocolate. Let  the excess drip off, then place each fruit on a parchment-lined baking sheet, quickly sprinkle with toppings, and chill until set.These matcha-dipped strawberries use a mix of black and white sesame seeds for added color and texture, but the topping options are endless. Try toasted coconut flakes, flakey salt, toasted chopped almonds, bee pollen, or even citrus zest. Here are some combinations to get you started:Cherries + White Chocolate Shell + Crumbled Freeze Dried StrawberriesDouble up on fruit for added sweetness and a beautiful color contrast.Strawberries + Blueberry White Chocolate Shell + Toasted Coconut FlakesMix freeze dried blueberry powder into your magic shell for a festive Fourth of July treat.Frozen Bananas + Matcha White Chocolate Shell + Bee PollenBee pollen provides crunch, color, and a hint of earthiness to play off the matcha.Whatever combination you choose, these riffs on dipped fruit are the perfect end to a summer dinner party. You can make a batch up to a day beforehand; just cover the sheet tray with plastic once the shell hardens so they don't pick up any fridge odors. You should probably make a double batch while you're at it\u2014these berries go fast.Get to dippingMatcha-Dipped StrawberriesMatcha and sesame seeds take these strawberries to a place chocolate-dipped berries only dream of.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthy DessertsStrawberryWhite ChocolateMatchaSummer DessertsRead Morecooking82 Healthy Summer Recipes to Make Over and Over AgainGallery82 SlidesBy The Healthyish TeamRecipes you want to make.
