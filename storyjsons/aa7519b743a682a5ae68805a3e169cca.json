They're the supposed panacea for anxiety, depression, insomnia, hormonal issues, sex drive, skin conditions, gut health, and the list goes on. But do you really know what an adaptogen is? And, more importantly, do you know how to use them?Okay, what\u2019s an adaptogen?Adaptogens are a class of plants that are thought to fight stress and balance the body. While many adaptogens have been used for hundreds of years in a variety of cultures, from Chinese and Russian to Indian and Scandinavian, the term was coined by Soviet toxicologist N. V. Lazarev in 1947 to describe a substance with \u201cnon-specific\u201d resistance to adverse influences like stress. The concept drew from a Hungarian-Canadian endocrinologist named Hans Selye, who broke down humans' stress response into three phases: alarm, resistance, and exhaustion. Adaptogens are thought to decrease our sensitivity to outside stress, keeping us in the resistance phase, i.e., keeping us calm. Some adaptogens are commonly found in ayurveda, a medical system that originated in India over 3,000 years ago, but not all adaptogens are ayurvedic.What are the benefits of adaptogens?Generally, adaptogens help the body cope with physical and mental stress. \u201cThis class of herbs, and ashwagandha specifically, I think really matches our lifestyles right now,\u201d says Grace Galanti, a trained herbalist who grows adaptogens like ashwagandha root and tulsi holy basil at Furnace Creek Farm in Berks County, Pennsylvania. \u201cI see the classic busy working person in New York City, but I also see elderly people needing energy and endurance athletes using ashwagandha tea as part of their training regime.\u201dPhoto by Alex LauHow can you take adaptogens?\u201cI think it\u2019s become fashionable to add adaptogens to your drink, and you might get minimal effects from that, but you\u2019re not going to see those benefits from a one time use,\u201d says Dr. Amy Shah, M.D.\u201d Instead, she recommends consuming adaptogen powder or pills daily over a period of several months.Moon Juice and Sun Potion are two of the biggest names in the adaptogen game right now, flanked by a variety of new and well-established companies around the world. They offer a multitude of ways to incorporate adaptogens into your lifestyle, from liquid elixirs and powders to coffee mixes and tea blends. \u201cI tend to prefer liquid extracts because they pre-digest the herb and pull out some of the important constituents that your body will use,\u201d says Galanti.What you should know before buying\u201cThere are so many interactions between supplements and medication, so if you\u2019re someone under the care of a medical doctor, it goes without saying that you should be talking to them about any new supplements you\u2019re going to try, especially adaptogens,\u201d says Dr. Shah. \u201cEspecially if you\u2019re on thyroid hormones, you should let your doctor know, because adaptogens might change things.\u201dIn addition to speaking with your doctor, it\u2019s important to make sure any product is sourced safely. \u201cThese products aren\u2019t required to prove that they work, that they contain what they say on the ingredients list\u2014or even that they\u2019re safe\u2014before they can be sold,\u201d says Ali Webster, PhD, RD, Associate Director for Nutrition Communications at the International Food Information Council. \u201cLook for the USP seal on any bottle or jar of supplements, which indicates that the supplement was verified by the United States Pharmacopeia, or the NSF international dietary supplement certification.\u201dWith your adaptogens in hand, Galanti recommends starting out by making a tea. \u201cHaving a connection between your life habits and the plant that you\u2019re taking is really important, just like a meal,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the fact that you\u2019re consuming the herb\u2014it\u2019s a ritual that\u2019s calming, centering and also a part of self care.\u201dSome adaptogens and what they're commonly used for:Adaptogens can generally be classified as stress busters, but things get more complicated when broken down to an individual plant level. Scientific studies don't always back up individual experiences, but the two adaptogenic herbs most widely studied in Western medicine are ashwagandha and rhodiola. Still, a variety of adaptogens have been embraced worldwide. Here are some key ones to know:Ashwagandha: Ashwagandha is an ayurvedic herb used to combat stress for centuries, and modern studies reinforce ashwagandha\u2019s potential to reduce stress and anxiety in adults.  The gnarled root has also been embraced in the food world\u2014it\u2019s a common ingredient in moon milk and used by chefs like Angela Dimaguya, the former executive chef at Mission Chinese, to imbue dishes like steamed fish in a clay pot with a deep, earthy flavor.Rhodiola: Rhodiola has been used as a source of energy for centuries. Vikings downed rhodiola before raids, and cosmonauts aboard the Russian Space Station used the yellow flowered succulent to elevate their moods while floating through space. More recently, a 2013 study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found that amateur cyclists given rhodiola were able to complete a timed six-mile ride faster than the placebo group, and finished their pre-race warm-up with lower heart rates.Cordyceps: Cordyceps, reishi, and chaga are some of the many antioxidant-rich functional mushrooms with the potential to increase energy, boost the immune system, and reduce stress. In fact, Healthyish contributors Dr. Tiffany Lester and chef Seamus Mullen both reach for mushrooms to combat fatigue. Cordyceps are particularly known to have energizing effects, due to its beta-glucans, which are thought to have anti-inflammatory properties.Reishi: In addition to its antioxidant properties, reishi mushrooms may be able to enhance immune response and keep skin looking young by reducing dermal oxidation.Chaga: These mushrooms are a core part of natural medicine across northern Europe. Chaga mushrooms are one of the richest sources of antioxidants in nature, and are commonly used to reduce inflammation and boost immunity.Mucuna Pruriens: Billed as a \"dopamine bean,\" mucuna pruriens are a legume native to Africa and tropical Asia. Its seeds contain about 3.1\u20136.1% L-DOPA, the precursor to neurotransmitters like dopamine and adrenaline. While more research is needed, it is thought to be of therapeutic value, particularly in reducing psychological stress.Tocos: A powder derived from rice bran, tocos is high in Vitamin E and thus lauded as a shortcut to better skin (and as a non-dairy creamer!).Tulsi Holy Basil: While it looks similar to the basil found on your pasta, Tulsi holy basil is widely used as a calming herbal tea in Ayurvedic medicine. \u201cI make a point to eat some when I\u2019m in the field because I can fall asleep more easily and feel rested the next day,\u201d says Galanti. \u201cTulsi has more of a mental component helping with frazzled energy, and I think of ashwagandha as a physical strength and endurance\u2014I pair them together a lot.\u201dChill out and cook with adaptogens:Moon MilkSleepy?
