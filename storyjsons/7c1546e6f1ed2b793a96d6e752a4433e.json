When something\u2019s so easy to make that you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.When I was growing up, working at my church\u2019s annual Greek festival was nonnegotiable. If I wasn\u2019t frantically slapping together orders at the gyro booth, I was sweating onstage in a dance performance. If I wasn\u2019t dancing, I was scooping endless baklava sundaes. If I wasn\u2019t scooping, I was hiding from my yiayia so she couldn\u2019t set me up with an eligible Greek boy.But the only place I really wanted to be was the frapp\u00e9 tent. In there my aunts and cousins wielded milk frothers like wands, conjuring plastic cups of creamy, frothy, ice-cold coffee to soothe festivalgoers from the South Carolina summer heat.A little over a year ago, when the concept of whipped coffee arrived right in time to distract homebound Americans from the terror of the burgeoning pandemic, my mind was immediately blown by this culinary magic trick. But then I quickly realized dalgona coffee\u2014popularized after South Korean actor Jung Il-woo ordered the drink from caf\u00e9 owner Leong Kam Hon on television\u2014was cut from the same cloth as my beloved frapp\u00e9.Whipped coffee has long been enjoyed in countries across the world. In India and Pakistan, the drink is known as beaten coffee, or phenti hui coffee, among other names. For me and other Greeks, it\u2019s instantly recognizable as frapp\u00e9, a milky, foamy, iced coffee beverage served throughout Greece and at Greek-American festivals and restaurants.The frapp\u00e9 reportedly originated by accident. In 1957, Nescaf\u00e9 salesman Dimitrios Vakondios was at the Thessaloniki International Fair and craving a coffee. He snatched a shaker meant to make a children\u2019s chocolate drink, popped in his instant coffee instead, and produced what would eventually become the frapp\u00e9. Nescaf\u00e9 ultimately seized on the drink, and by the \u201980s it was promoting the frapp\u00e9 in its advertisements. The frapp\u00e9 became popular across Greece, found in just about every caf\u00e9 and taverna, and has come to embody the Greek way of life: Relax, take things slow, and enjoy where you are.Since my hometown\u2019s Greek Fest only comes around once a year (and trips to Greece even less frequently), I had to learn to make frapp\u00e9s for myself at home. Thankfully, it\u2019s just as easy, if not more so, than any other home coffee preparation method.To make one, add about 2 teaspoons instant coffee (Nescaf\u00e9 is, clearly, the best choice) and 3 to 4 tablespoons or so of cold water to a cup or jar. Add a spoonful of sugar if desired. Use a milk frother to whip until thick, foamy, and light brown. Fill a tall glass halfway with ice, then pour the mixture over the ice. Top with cold water until the drink reaches the top of the glass. You can also add a splash of milk if you\u2019d like (which I always do).If you don\u2019t have a milk frother, never fear! You can also shake the instant coffee and water in a cocktail shaker or closed jar until foamy.You can customize the drink with milk or sugar to suit your preferences. In general there are three ways to order it: sketo (plain, without sugar), metrio (medium, 1 to 2 spoonfuls sugar), and glyko (sweet, 2 to 4 spoonfuls sugar). At home, it\u2019s even easier to tweak sugar and milk amounts to your taste until you land on just the right drink.Frapp\u00e9s can be enjoyed anytime of day, but I like them in the afternoon, sitting outside if I can, closing my eyes and imagining the Mediterranean sun on my face. They\u2019re also great for watching the sunset, when you can linger with your drink as the sky slowly dims. Or, of course, hiding behind the baklava sundae tent in the sticky Low Country heat, praying your Greek grandmother doesn\u2019t find you before you finish your drink.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimplecookingRecipes you want to make.
