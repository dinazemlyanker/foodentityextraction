Chances are you already have them, too: Extra-virgin olive oil. Regular vegetable oil. Red wine vinegar and rice vinegar. Kosher salt and my peppermill. That\u2019s six. Item number seven: Bragg\u2019s nutritional yeast.That\u2019s right, friends. I will hunt around in my spice drawer to find crushed red pepper flakes, but I want the nutritional yeast to be in my line of vision the second I walk through the door. That\u2019s because it makes most things taste better.Before you ask: No, nutritional yeast is not the same kind of yeast you\u2019d use for baking bread or brewing beer. It\u2019s related, but nutritional yeast is grown specifically to be harvested and dried into flakes. The leavening power is deactivated in the process, but lots of desirable qualities remain. Nutritional yeast is weirdly high in protein (5 grams per tablespoon) and is a decent source of fiber. Most of the brands on the market are also fortified with B vitamins, which is especially important if you\u2019re on a vegan or vegetarian diet. I am not on either of those diets. I am, however, on the nutritional yeast diet. I have become a Bragg\u2019s aficionado because I can find it everywhere and its texture is appealingly voluminous, with giant-sized flakes. Plus, I love their cider vinegar, so there\u2019s some brand loyalty there, too.Nutritional yeast has salty, cheese-esque attributes, and when you combine it with actual salt, it legitimately turns into something best described as Magic Dust. It is superlative on popcorn, which is one of my favorite foods, but it will also add a subtly addictive flair to vinaigrettes (or maybe it\u2019s addictively subtle?!). I stir it into standard salsa verdes to give them a pesto-ish depth, and I shake it with abandon all over sauteed greens and bowls of beans. If you had some sour cream and mixed in some garlic powder, lemon juice, and \u201cnut yeast,\u201d you\u2019d have a ranch-y dip that the kids would clamor for. If you served some buttered rice showered with nutritional yeast, you\u2019d never go back to denuded rice again. Seared mushrooms, already packed with umami, get even more so when dusted with \u201cnooch.\u201dWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that anything that you\u2019d serve with a pinch of flaky salt or a squeeze of lemon, you can serve with a little shake of Bragg\u2019s nut yeast. As essential as olive oil, but with a little more magic.Buy it: Bragg Nutritional Yeast Seasoning, $9 at amazon.comAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
