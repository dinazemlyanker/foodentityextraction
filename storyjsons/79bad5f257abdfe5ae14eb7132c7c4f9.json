The verdant carrot top salsa is the real star here, balancing tart fresh tomatillos with gently charred scallions and lots of lime juice. The result is a bright condiment that can also perk up any protein, salad, grain\u2014or even tortilla chips. If your carrots came without greens, use cilantro in their place.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I'm glad we scaled it up a bit because we barely had any left over. Not much protein but it was still a satisfying dinner. Clearly there are plenty of ways to rif on this with other winter veggies, but it was perfect for the last of the corrots and (oversized) scallions coming out of the garden. Every oven is a bit different, so watch the sheet pan closely so everything is browning and carmelizing, but not charring too much. Similarly, all peppers are bit different, so add the jalape\u00f1os in small batches until you get the heat you want.Eric W.Durham, NC3/13/2022Excellent recipe and a fun way to use tomatillos. I agree with the previous review that this wasn\u2019t quite enough for a main dish. I will make it again but as a light lunch,or add more vegetables, or pair it with a protein and use it as a side dish. Anonymous3/11/2022I made this as written with fresh local scallions, sweet potatoes, and carrots from the farmer\u2019s market. I served it with crumbled feta. It was fresh and delicious.  The recipe made more salsa than we needed for the vegetables. I served this as a main course, but it was not entirely satisfying as a main. Next time I will serve it with a protein as a side perhaps.Josie L.New Orleans, LA3/4/2022I had never made anything with Tomatillos before. The salsa was delicious and pairs so nicely with the sweet caramelized flavors of the roasted toot vegetables! I used goat milk feta cheese crumbles and serrano peppers and it had just the right amount of kick and creamy coolness! susan bentsenSeattle, Wa2/19/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titDinnerWeeknightSheet-Pan DinnersEasyVegetarianNut-FreeSweet PotatoPotatoVegetableCarrotTomatilloSideRoastRecipes you want to make.
