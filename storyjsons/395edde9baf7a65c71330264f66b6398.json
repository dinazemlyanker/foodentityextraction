To make the TV adaptation of the bestselling Stephanie Danler novel as authentic as possible, the entire cast was trained as if they were working in a real restaurant. According to Caitlin FitzGerald, who plays wine expert and server Simone on the series, it was a \u201ctotal war zone\u201d during training at the Institute of Culinary Education. At least 20 wine keys were broken learning to open bottles tableside, and hot plates filled with a few pounds of real food shattered, but all of that couldn\u2019t break the cast\u2019s spirits. Throughout two grueling weeks, \u201cfront of house adviser\u201d Justine Slattery (who spent 8 years at Union Square Caf\u00e9) helped everyone get to a point where it felt like an authentic running restaurant, and the only fake part of the show was the booze\u2014no alcohol could be poured on set.The interior of 22W, Sweetbitter\u2019s fictional restaurant in NYC.\nMacall Polay/StarzEven though the wine was tinted water, the knowledge about vino had to be real for FitzGerald. Her character Simone spills wine knowledge effortlessly, coaching doe-eyed newcomer Tess (Ella Purnell) on how to taste with every part of her palate\u2014sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami, as displayed across the STARZ show\u2019s promotional posters\u2014and distinguish the difference between Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. Before the show, FitzGerald worked in catering as a teenager and at 10 restaurants during college and between auditions in NYC, but none were \u201cas nice as 22W or required knowing so much information, especially about wine,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the restaurants that I worked in, if you had a few things to say about each wine by the glass, you could get by. Most customers say, \u2018I like a dry white\u2019 or \u2018I like a full-bodied red,\u2019 so I had an answer for both of those, and a few in between. I never had an intimate relationship with wine until working on Sweetbitter.\u201dIn addition to learning \u201cthe ritual and ceremony of opening and pouring a bottle of wine tableside,\u201d and how to hold a bottle properly, FitzGerald had to learn how to talk about wine. Slattery, the show\u2019s restaurant consultant, currently works at wine bar Terroir in TriBeca and taught FitzGerald the art of wine conversation through osmosis. Slattery explained: \u201cWine is so intimidating to people, and oftentimes they\u2019re just hoping the server will solve 35 years\u2019 worth of marital strife and be their therapist. Navigating that is what the industry calls \u2018reading your table.\u2019 You have to know what people want in a split second and figure out if they want something new and interesting or chill and approachable.\u201dFitzGerald (right) masters the three-plate hold on Sweetbitter.\nMacall Polay/StarzThe most difficult task to master on set for FitzGerald was opening a bottle of champagne. The script instructed her to open it \u201cwith barely a whisper,\u201d meaning no pop, no flying cork, and definitely no exploding bubbly. \u201cJustine and I opened 30 bottles of champagne one afternoon. I would say when we shot it, I had about a 30 percent success rate,\u201d FitzGerald recalled with a laugh. \u201cThere was a couple of takes where I almost took my eye out!\u201d (The trick is to keep pressure on the top of the cork with your thumb and hold the base of the bottle with your other hand. When you open it, gently twist the bottle and cork in opposite directions until it inches out.) One other eye-opening moment for her was learning about the difference in wine temperatures: \u201cWhite wine should be taken out of the fridge 20 minutes before serving, and red wine should be put in the fridge for the same amount of time. If the wine\u2019s too warm, the alcohol is the predominant flavor, and if it\u2019s a little bit chilled, you get all the different complex notes.\u201dOn Sweetbitter, every 22W employee has to pass a written exam and a shadowed day of service to show their competence at the restaurant.  Slattery said that a standard NYC restaurant would likely have 15\u201330 comprehensive questions that gives management an idea of how much someone learns in a two-week trial run and what their weaknesses are.We excerpted six questions from the show\u2019s fine-dining test, and FitzGerald aced it (with bonus points for wine barrel drawings\u2014check it out below):Click here to enlarge the test and see FitzGerald\u2019s answers (and wine barrel drawings) up close.\nAlex LauFitzGerald never had to take one of these tests during her restaurant days in NYC, but thinking back to her time waitressing stirred up a lot of old memories\u2014especially the embarrassing ones. Her character, Simone, almost floats through the dining room, but in her 20s, she was not as graceful. \u201cI was holding a pitcher of red sangria, tripped, and poured the entirety of it onto a woman\u2019s white cashmere coat!\u201d she recalled. \u201cThe whole restaurant went silent and stared at me, and I thought, \u2018I could just walk out. I could get my coat and walk out the door and not look back.\u2019 But instead, I paid her dry cleaning bill and came back the next day.\u201d A decade later, she is still spilling wine and breaking glasses, but on Sweetbitter, the Gossip Girl of the restaurant world, the drama is fully embraced.Speaking of wine...Explore Bon App\u00e9titTvInterviewsCelebritiesRecipes you want to make.
