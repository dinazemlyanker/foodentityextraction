I make it about once a week and frequently top each bowl with some sliced grilled steak. CarolineWashington, DC12/29/2020Ignore the reviews that say this is too acidic. The dressing is great as written - only change was to add some grated fresh ginger.SpencerOakland, CA11/17/2020I used Hokkien egg noodles on this, not sure if this was the reason but the sauce didn't have any taste at all. I could taste a bit of vinegar but that was it. AnonymousSingapore8/28/2020My new favorite for a \u201ccool\u201d ramen fix. It\u2019s light and so easy to add all the great veggies coming out of my Summer garden. I steamed some edamame as a side, but there are endless possibilities! k_sandeWest Linn, OR7/31/2020Was delicious with fried shrimp on top. I added a bit of salt and some honey to the dressing and found that punched it up quite a bit.AnonymousBrooklyn6/24/2020This recipe is really good! To make it more of a meal and balance out some of the intense acidity, we added 9 minute boiled eggs to ours. Be forewarned though, this noodle salad gave me/my boyfriend/my mom intense heartburn. Proceed with caution!ThoseFeratuSouthern California10/21/2019Chris Morocco, always out here with the intense acidity. I expected this from him so I tasted the dressing before throwing it on everything and then added a tsp. of mirin to sweeten it up (but I'm sure plain old sugar would do it.) Perfecto. Great with a miso egg.AnonymousAustin, TX9/6/2019I\u2019m so sad to be leaving a not-so-good review! I was really excited to make this, and I doubled up the ramen and dressing so I could meal prep some lunches for the week. But now I couldn\u2019t even finish my bowl, and I\u2019m not sure if I want the lunches. The finished product looked beautiful but was very bitter. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was too much rice vinegar, or maybe I was tasting the red cabbage too much? Either way, something was off that made this not delicious. I may try again with less rice vinegar, or maybe some brown sugar? Can someone else help with how to save this recipe?bexpocalypseRichmond VA8/12/2019This looks delicious! But what is the name of the vegetable on the far right?Anonymous8/8/2019Was very good, especially in all this heat!AnonymousConshohocken, PA7/23/2019Just everything I want to eat in 100 degree weather!
