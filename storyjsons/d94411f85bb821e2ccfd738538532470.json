No matter what your astrological sign is, you agree with this. We can feel it. Which is why your February horoscopes come with a doughnut prediction, and the best way to achieve your destiny is to get in a car and set your heart/GPS for the nearest bakery. Below, read what the stars have in store for you this month.Illustration by Taro UryuAriesYou\u2019ve recently taken on some extra responsibility, which you normally hate, but after multiple pep-talks with yourself in the bathroom mirror, you\u2019ll be extra confident in your ability to win at life this month. Say \u201cyes!\u201d to all the work luncheons and opportunities to network. You out of anyone know how to break the ice and make a lasting impression. Maybe it\u2019s your way with words (zero filter) that makes you so lovable. Maybe it\u2019s because you brought a box of chocolate frosted doughnuts to that meeting. Just like you, they\u2019re no BS: straight-up chocolate on freshly fried dough. There\u2019s no unexpected filling hiding inside\u2014what you see is what you get.Illustration by Taro UryuTaurusBig changes are underway in your career this month, and while this can make you feel uneasy, rest assured that your loyalty and hard work do not go unnoticed, and this will help you in the long run. You\u2019ll feel a big boost of optimism, which will help you get (weirdly) excited about change. Abundance comes in the form of friendship this month, so plan accordingly with the squad\u2014that\u2019s who will support you as you move out your comfort zone. That is, move out of your glazed doughnut comfort zone, and pair your coffee with a Boston kreme doughnut\u2014irresistibly sweet custard with a touch of chocolate frosting in every bite, sure to meet your high standards of decadence.Illustration by Taro UryuGeminiThings have gotten waaay too serious for you, and you find yourself cracking random jokes when the convo gets too dry. You need to detach from drama and free up those extra brain cells for creativity and adventure this month. Doing so will naturally brighten up all areas of your life, particularly your relationships and your general outlook. And you know what else will brighten up your life? A jelly doughnut. You don\u2019t care how messy it gets, because finger-foods are fun and no one is going to take that from you. Besides, a little powdered sugar on the tip of the nose never hurt anyone.Illustration by Taro UryuCancerYour patience is being tested and you find that you are quicker to boil this month (dare we say crabby??). This is good, Cancer, because you are often more tolerant than you need to be. You\u2019ve recently shifted your focus to the long-term and you\u2019re done wasting energy on things with zero yield. Ask yourself, \u201cwill it matter in three years?\u201d Similarly, you\u2019re being more cautious with saving your money for real-deal investments. Trends come and go but lucky for you, glazed doughnuts are here to stay. Not overly sweet, exquisitely modest, and above all: consistent. Just what you need to stay focused on what matters most.Illustration by Taro UryuLeoYour focus this month is on relationships\u2014romantic and platonic both. No one is doubting your warmth and generosity, but it\u2019s (maybe) time to show it a bit more. All of this extra effort to meet people halfway (let\u2019s be real, you prefer to lead) is making you hungry, so reach for a cruller\u2014twisty, crispy on the outside sweetness with a baroque shape that stands out against the rest, perfect for someone who is fearlessly unique. We know we can\u2019t put you in a box, but we\u2019ll take a dozen of these to go.Illustration by Taro UryuVirgoThis month, you\u2019ll be paying more attention to your health and how you ration your time. You might decide you\u2019re spending too many hours on social media, when you could be talking to people IRL instead. You\u2019re a perfectionist: you set your expectations too high, put too much on your plate, and then throw it all out when you get overwhelmed. Look at your calendar and be real with yourself. What\u2019s realistically doable in a day? One thing you can squeeze in before the commute to work? Matcha doughnuts\u2014vivid, eye catching green pastries that trick everyone into thinking they are eating something healthy, with an extra caffeine buzz to energize you through that to-do list.Illustration by Taro UryuLibraWhile you are normally really good at maintaining a steady juggle in your balanced life, this month you\u2019ve got permission to let loose! You\u2019ve earned the right to have \u201ctoo much of a good thing\u201d, which you can interpret as you wish: a Tuesday night steak dinner, that pedicure with the little fish, a new pair of socks, whatever feels indulgent. You often overthink your decisions, but this time let your heart lead you. Also let your heart lead you to the nearest, pinkest strawberry sprinkle doughnut\u2014most sought after by Homer Simpson and Libras alike\u2014you can\u2019t help yourself when it comes to a dessert that\u2019s as sweet on the eyes as it is on the palate. And not to worry, no one\u2019s expecting you to share this time.Illustration by Taro UryuScorpioGiving yourself time to recharge is vital to your being, so this month you\u2019ll want to spend more time at home. Admittedly, you\u2019ve been neglecting your living space, which is why this month is optimal for playing catch up on some of those projects (okay, your Netflix queue too). Your friends are used to getting cryptic texts from you; let them wonder what \u201cbusy\u201d actually means. For lazy Sundays on the couch, go for the mighty bear claw. It\u2019s complex (like you), sounds tougher than it is (also like you), and is big enough to be considered a hobby. Hey, we don\u2019t make the rules.Illustration by Taro UryuSagittariusYour mind is craving fresh material this month and Instagram\u2019s discover page isn\u2019t cutting it this time. You\u2019re seeking a juicy mystery novel, or maybe that big book on quantum mechanics\u2014something you can get lost in. You\u2019ve got a nice boost of can-do enthusiasm that will last for a couple months; ride this wave while you can. It\u2019s rare for you to be this focused, Sag, but now is excellent time for research and absorbing new material. You\u2019ll also need to absorb some calories (for thinking fuel!) in the form of a coconut doughnut, a melt-in-your-mouth miracle that is so out of this world that you forget which planet you are on. And as you know, you can never pass up a sweet, sweet distraction.Illustration by Taro UryuCapricornIt\u2019s no secret that you have finer tastes, but you are no spendthrift either. You\u2019ll be dropping some cash this month; you might replace your worn-down phone case and get those boots that have been in your shopping cart for ages. You know it\u2019s worth investing in yourself, but sometimes you need a reminder. This year marks a major turning point in your life, so we want you to fully commit right now. Show up, do what\u2019s necessary, and speak your truth\u2014and for those moments when you shouldn\u2019t say anything at all, pop a powdered sugar doughnut in your mouth! As you know well, it\u2019s bitter black coffee\u2019s one true pairing. If you\u2019ve got powdered sugar all over your face, you know you\u2019re doing it right.Illustration by Taro UryuAquariusHappy birthday, Aquarius! You\u2019re calling the shots and we\u2019re doing our best to keep up with you. If you take anything seriously this month, let that be your career. Your skills could catch your boss\u2019s eye this month, so put yourself out there and get ready for more opportunities coming your way. If there are any habits you\u2019ve been trying to kick (other than doughnut habits), here\u2019s a window of opportunity for you to do so. You always keep things interesting and your ideas are constantly ahead of the curve, which is why you need a Bavarian doughnut\u2014a treat as ingenious as you are. Whoever thought pairing pudding and pastry was a good idea (prob an Aquarius) definitely wasn\u2019t wrong.Illustration by Taro UryuPiscesWhen it comes to your career, you are a powerhouse right now. You are bringing an edgy creative spirit to your ongoing projects, which inspires you to take those big ideas to the next level. While this is a great month for you to take those risks, be mindful that you don\u2019t take on more than you can handle or else you\u2019ll feel all over the place. Concentrate your aim by reserving plenty of downtime for yourself. We recommend yoga, bubble baths, and a giant apple fritter\u2014deep fried delicious grooves of apple cinnamon as multifaceted and dreamy as you are\u2014and if you can combine all of those activities, even better.Catherine O\u2019Neill is an astrologer and writer now coping with a bit of a doughnut craving.
