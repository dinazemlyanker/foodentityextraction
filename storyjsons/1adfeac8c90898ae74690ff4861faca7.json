The first shake, without ice, helps create the foam. After adding ice, the second shake chills the drink and further aerates the whites. This recipe is from Honey's in NYC.IngredientsMakes 11\u00bdoz. fresh lime juice1\u00bdoz. Yola Mezcal1oz.

I'm new to the mezcal scene and was looking for new mixers for it. Bought the amaro montenegro just for this recipe. Now I need to find other mixers for the amaro. Veloholicsouth louisiana3/18/2021Wonderful riff on a traditional sour. I used Amaro Nonino this time. Am looking forward to trying other Amaros. MJLas Vegas, NV3/3/2021Delicious. Used Amaro Siciliano because it was all I had but the drink was very tasty. Into the rotation it goes.
