If everything else about the day is unknown and anxiety-inducing, at least I have the grounding calmness of my routine. Wake up. Do a free online workout. Make oatmeal. Boil water for a French press. Do whatever I can to avoid Twitter (unless it\u2019s for my job).And there\u2019s one thing making this whole routine a little better: my Fellow electric kettle. Unlike most electric kettles, it\u2019s not an eyesore. It\u2019s matte black, super sleek, and doesn\u2019t have the see-through-glass-aquarium-bubble vibes like most versions do. Since I know I\u2019ll get a Slack about it from Alex Delany, I should add that I have the normal spout option because I live in a French press and tea household. But I know many of my BA colleagues love the pour-over, stovetop version. The long neck of the spout allows you to pour at an even, slow pace, which is crucial for a good pour-over. You do you, but let me make a case for this electric kettle.There\u2019s a spinny button that allows you to set the temperature to the exact degree you want, meaning my boyfriend can have his 170 degree water for his tea and I can have my 200 degree water for my French press. Oh, and it heats up QUICKLY. It takes only about five minutes to get to 200 degrees, which just so happens to be about how long it takes me to gather my coffee accoutrement. It brings certainty, in a time of, well, the opposite.Stagg EKG Electric Gooseneck Kettle$149 at The BA MarketPhoto courtesy of NordstromCorvo EKG Electric Kettle$149 at Food52Explore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendShoppingproductRead MorecultureThis Turmeric Chai Is My Proven Winter Coping Mechanism\u00a0By Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
