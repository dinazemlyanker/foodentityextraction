I just didn\u2019t know what they were.But how could they not be great? \u201cCreamed\u201d + \u201cEggs\u201d = guaranteed tasty. What showed up on my plate at this new-ish all-day cafe in Chicago\u2019s Ukranian Village was...not what I expected. I guess I was thinking something more British-y\u2014like coddled eggs in cute little ramekins.Instead, imagine a warm, velvety smooth egg salad fit for some duchess or czar\u2014that\u2019s chef Abigail Zielke\u2019s creamed eggs. She grew up in Wisconsin and got the recipe from her mom, who inherited the recipe from her very Southern mother.As professional chefs will do, Abigail zhuzhes up the dish with some pro-level technique. She makes a basic roux and whisks in some heavy cream or milk to form what\u2019s essentially a bechamel sauce. She then adds hand-torn, just-under-hard-boiled eggs, which she folds into the creamy sauce. The yolks melt into the bechamel, giving it a spring-timey yellow hue.At the restaurant, Abigail serves the luxurious mixture over a bed of braised collards atop a thick slab of charred toast. A sprinkle of Aleppo pepper and a few pickled pearl onions help offset all that creaminess.I thought I would only make it through a few bites, given how rich the dish is. But I ended up demolishing it\u2014it\u2019s that delicious. An indulgent, but perfectly balanced brunch/lunch order. Which brings me back to zeroing in on the creamed eggs in the first place. Menus are like the SATs. Even if you don\u2019t know which answer to bubble in (or in this case, what exactly you're ordering), follow your first instinct. You\u2019ll generally be right.Go there: All Together NowExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsChicagoBrunchRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
