This afternoon chaat was his happy hour, and he wouldn\u2019t even remove his shoes until he\u2019d scarfed down a bowl. Chaat is a street food found throughout South Asia that can appear in a multitude of forms, from pani puri, which are crispy semolina shells filled with tart tamarind water, to bhel puri, a mix of puffed rice and peanuts dressed with fiery mustard oil. Anything can be a chaat as long as there\u2019s a mix of crispy textures, acid, spice, and, of course, funky, salty chaat masala for seasoning. This chaat recipe is inspired by my father\u2019s, and made with ingredients I have around during peak summer. Juicy ripe peaches, raw sweet corn, and roasted peanuts get tossed with aromatics and dressed in a perky nimbu pani, a spiced salty limeade. The whole thing is the perfect refreshing, recharging antidote to a day spent out in the sun. \u2014Sohla El-WayllyIngredients2 servings2ears of corn, husked1medium ripe peach, cut into \u2153\" pieces\u00bdsmall red onion, cut into \u2153\" pieces2green Thai or serrano chiles, thinly sliced1garlic clove, very thinly sliced11\" piece ginger, peeled, cut into matchsticks\u2153cup coarsely chopped cilantro\u2153cup salted roasted peanuts or other nut\u00bdtsp. freshly ground black pepper2tsp. sugar, divided2\u00bdtsp. chaat masala, divided\u00bccup fresh lime juice\u2153cup aloo bhujia, sev, or crushed potato chipsPreparationStep 1Stand corn upright in a medium bowl and slice off corn kernels with a sharp knife.

It's the perfect blend of crunchy and citrus-y and just-a-hint sweet. It's been really hot here the past couple of weeks, and this really, really hit the spot. I've made it about four times since first making it a little over a week ago, it is THAT good. Go get the ingredients for it now (this is peak summer-y produce)! Don't walk, run! ;) AnonymousCalifornia8/21/2020Making this tonight for my Indian-American husband. We love riffs on chaat. At our house we make a version of samosa chaat. Bake frozen samosas (4-6 depending on size) and while chilling cut into smaller pieces and combine the following: one red, yellow or orange pepper, 2-3 Persian cucumbers (Sliced, salted and places in colander to drain), a big handful or two of finely chopped spinach and cilantro. Chop samosas when at room temp and add to veggie bowl. The add tamarind chutney and cilantro chutney (both available at any Indian grocery) about 1/3 a cup of each perhaps more to taste. Add chaat masala start w a tablespoon or two. Add 1/2 cup of whole milk yogurt and combine. Finish w a squeeze of lemon, some fresh chopped cilantro and sev. My sister says this would be her last meal on earth given the option. Enjoy! \ud83d\udc96\u2728AnonymousNew York8/18/2020This is amazingly good. I made a bowl on Saturday and then another on Sunday. There is a fair chance that I will make another today. yum.\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations for other Chaat variations?AnonymousBoston8/17/2020Is the corn raw? Doesn't it need to be cooked at all first?
