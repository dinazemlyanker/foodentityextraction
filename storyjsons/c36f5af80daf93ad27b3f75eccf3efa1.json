I grabbed my wallet and power-walked to the closest grocery store open at that hour. Under normal late-night circumstances, I\u2019d settle for whatever the bodega on the corner had to offer, but this was no regular craving. To this day, I\u2019m still a little embarrassed to admit that I was on the hunt for a can of Progresso\u2019s White Clam Sauce, which I then sloppily ate with a bowl of overcooked linguine and the rest of whatever wine I had on hand.This was just as I was embarking on my journey to becoming a capital-F Food writer, so I prioritized eating at trendy restaurants and cooking with the finest ingredients. I worked long hours and interned for free, so when these indulgences wiped my bank account clean, I had to start eating like the kid I\u2019d once been. I grew up in a lower-middle class home, eating processed and packaged food out of necessity. I hated and loved it at the same time.My love of food was instilled in me by my mom, the woman most often serving me the packaged food I scorned. Together, we\u2019d watch hours of food shows. The hosts used fresh ingredients, not the Zatarain\u2019s jambalaya or the Michelangelo\u2019s frozen piccata we actually ate. I couldn\u2019t help but feel ashamed and angry with her for buying this stuff, even if it did taste good. What I couldn\u2019t see through my teenage angst was that she was actually trying her best to turn the food she could afford into the food I wanted to eat. She\u2019d doctor up the Zatarain\u2019s jambalaya with shrimp and kielbasa, and she\u2019d serve the Michelangelo\u2019s chicken with side of fragrant shallot rice. She was making the kind of thrifty, creative meals that would eventually make Tasty videos so popular, long before Buzzfeed even existed.But I was too embarrassed and angry to notice. When Ina Garten would croon in her patronizing way, \u201cstore-bought is fine,\u201d it felt like she knew I was eating a Hot Pocket for dinner, and worse yet, she knew I was poor. It took me a long time to realize that my mom also would have preferred the delicacies we saw on TV. But she had a family of six to feed and not much money to do it with, so we shopped at Walmart and ate canned clam sauce.I swore to myself that the moment I moved out, I\u2019d never look twice at another Lean Cuisine. However, as a jobless young person attending college in New York City, I quickly discovered that the food I\u2019d always wanted to eat wasn\u2019t going to fit neatly into my $25-a-week food budget. Like my mom, I\u2019d have to get thrifty. There were bowls of Rice-A-Roni with the fanciest cheese and mushrooms I could afford; wedge salads with Snyders Hot Buffalo Wing Pretzel bites and Ken\u2019s Italian dressing; and of course, lots of pasta with clam sauce, which I still don\u2019t think needs much doctoring. I loved these meals, and so did everyone I cooked for. They weren\u2019t the fanciest or the healthiest, but with a little resourcefulness, they were close.My adventures in semi-homemade cooking helped me shed years of preconceived notions I had about what it means for food to be good. Sure, I still wanted to eat heirloom veggies, grass-fed beef, and all the other whole, fresh foods I\u2019d always dreamed of. But in the meantime, I\u2019d be happy to enjoy the packaged food I\u2019d once despised, as long as I could give it the treatment it deserved.Sometimes still, packaged food is the only thing that can scratch an itch. On a trip to Walmart with my mom during the holiday season a couple years later, we stopped in the chip aisle to gawk at the selection. Her eyes skipped over the many flavors of Lays and landed directly on Knorr\u2019s Vegetable Dip, which she assured me was the best. \u201cBut only if you add chopped water chestnuts,\u201d she dictated. We did, and she was right. It was the best and I wasn\u2019t ashamed to admit it.Another throwback:Explore Bon App\u00e9titGroceryRead MoreLifestyleI Dubiously Tried 6 'Healthy' Mac & Cheese Brands to Find the BestGallery7 SlidesBy Oset BaburRecipes you want to make.
