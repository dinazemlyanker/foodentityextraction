(Your waitress will scrawl the day\u2019s short but sweet offerings on the white-papered table or recite to you at the bar. We're still charmed.) Dishes riff on classics, like a Scandi twist on carpaccio with dill and caraway or a very Midwestern-tasting crisp-skinned trout with aioli underneath. However, the stellar burger\u2014a hefty grass-fed beef patty with lightly pickled onions and white cheddar, and served next to a mountain of starchy fries\u2014is always there for you.THE VIBE IS: rather intimate and cocoon-like, thanks to the low ceilings, very tiny tables with black park bench seats, and the occasional visit from your waitress, who will sit down right next to you when taking your order. But with Queen humming on the speakers and little kids wandering to and from the bathroom with their parents, it feels like a very low-fuss party, even on a sleepy Sunday night.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day: Monday to Thursday, from 6 p.m. to midnight; Friday, from 11 am. to midnight; and Saturday to Sunday, from 10 a.m. to midnight. It\u2019s easy enough to walk in and eat at the bar, but reserve via Resy for better luck with booking a table.\u2014Elyse InamineMel BarlowWE ALSO LOVELiliaA special occasion spot that changes the pasta paradigmWin SonTaiwan meets the American South in the heart of hipster BrooklynAskaThe new New Nordic tasting-menu blowout.Explore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
