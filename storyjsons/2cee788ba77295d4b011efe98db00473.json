Then there\u2019s Verjus. The newest bar/restaurant/wine store/housewares shop from Lindsay and Michael Tusk of Quince and Cotogna fame, it\u2019s a culinary wonderland that\u2019s redefining what fast-casual means for the city.Enter through the wine shop and you\u2019ll be transported to what appears to be a cross between a Spanish pintxo bar and a Parisian cave \u00e0 manger (essentially a wine shop with snacks). But really it\u2019s a scrapbook of the Tusks\u2019 European adventures. The 30 tapas bars they\u2019ve hit up in Spain inspired the sleek counter, where you can pick up some of the olives, tortilla espa\u00f1ola, and tinned fish on display (or order from the glowing menu) and then grab a table. The midcentury-style tables are made by French designer Pierre Chapo, whom the Tusks discovered in Provence; they then commissioned his son to build the chairs. The items stocked in an apothecary cabinet Lindsay nabbed at a notoriously cutthroat antique fair in Parma aren\u2019t just for show; they\u2019re also for sale. And in true cave style, you can buy a bottle of wine at the bar to take home\u2014or settle in and make a night of it.This kind of casual is exactly what the Tusks craved\u2014and something they wanted to share with their hometown. Here\u2019s how they weaved it all together at Verjus.Photo by TollesonThe MenuIn lieu of paper menus, the Tusks created a maximalist marquee\u2013like light box\u2014inspired by the designs of Isaac Julien\u2014that stretches the length of the dining room and features the more French leanings of the restaurant. Go ahead and stare.Photo by Aubrie PickThe SlicerMeet the Cadillac of meat cutters. Michael collects slicers\u2014he has six\u2014but this 1920s Van Berkel model on Verjus\u2019 countertop is his favorite. \u201cIt\u2019s meant to be a design piece but also functional when we need it,\u201d he says. That workhorse slices about 600 paper-thin sheets of house-made charcuterie a night.Photo by Aubrie PickThe MusicWine director Matt Cirne and Michael bonded over the Replacements, so it\u2019s no surprise they invested in a quality sound system here. In hi-fi nerdspeak, that means vintage Rogers speakers, a McIntosh pre-amp, and a McIntosh power amp to pipe their vinyl collections.Photo by Aubrie PickThe KnivesThe corners of Verjus are packed with mementos from the couple\u2019s time spent roaming the globe, including these stunning cheese knives from Paris, hung as they\u2019d be in a cave \u00e0 manger.Photo by Christopher StarkThe CabinetIn its former life the cabinet served as a shop case for an apothecary in 1890s Florence. These days it displays housewares available for purchase, from French ceramics to Japanese cedar ice buckets.Photo by Aubrie PickThe Conserva BarThe 30 some-odd tapas bars the Tusks hit up over the years in San Sebasti\u00e1n, Barcelona, and Madrid inspired this set-up that focuses on the Spanish side of Verjus. The bar is made with the same elm used elsewhere in the space and crowned with a sleek yet functional stainless steel counter. All the chalkboard menu options are laid out on top\u2014croissants, olives, and tortilla espanola\u2014and behind it you\u2019ll see 30 varieties of tinned fish, which you can eat with accompaniments like piment\u00f3n and lemon. \u201cIt\u2019s about breaking down barriers,\u201d Lindsay says. \u201cYou can order based on what catches your eye, which brings a certain amount of freedom.\u201dPhoto by TollesonThe CeilingLindsay imagined installing mirrors overhead\u2014she loves how they bring more light into a room. But she couldn\u2019t shake off the burgundy ceiling she\u2019d seen at Le Baron Rouge, a blue-collar wine bar in Paris. She found a happy medium in this reflective oxblood-red paint made by Fine Paints of Europe with its high-gloss \u201cBrilliant\u201d finish.Photo by Aubrie PickThe Wine ShelvesLindsay hired local artisan Michael Mellon to create custom elm shelving that can fit magnums alongside regular bottles, like the cult favorite Vini Viti Vinci\u2019s 2016 Vieilles Vignes. The design is inspired by the modern tables and chairs to create a harmonious look.Photo by Aubrie PickThe FurnitureDuring a trip to L\u2019Ile sur la Sorgue in Provence, the Tusks discovered Pierre Chapo, a mid-century French furniture designer known for a warm, yet functional aesthetic. They fell in love with his work and ended up purchasing his round elm tables as well as commissioning Chapo\u2019s son, also a furniture designer, to make chairs and smaller tables.Photo by Aubrie PickThe Knick KnacksLike the home of any good traveler, the corners of Verjus are packed with mementos from the couple\u2019s time spent roaming the globe, from a model plane given as an opening gift by a close friend to a giant pig named Pierre atop the wine fridge. These cheeky planters were nabbed on a recent trip to Mexico City\u2014you can find something similar on Etsy if you search \u201cface planters\u201d (really).Photo by Aubrie PickThe Table MiseEach table is set with tiny canteens of Santa Maria Portuguese olive oil, a mild varietal they discovered on a trip to Lisbon; a rotating selection of high-quality table salts (right now you\u2019ll find shakers of Sel Gu\u00e9rande gray sea salt); pepper mills; and diner-style napkin dispensers that mimic the utilitarian offerings at tapas bars. It\u2019s all meant to encourage you to make yourself at home. \u201cYou go through a lot of napkins when you have small plates!\u201d Lindsay says.Photo by Aubrie PickThe LightsWhile you\u2019re gawking at the ceilings, pay attention to the light. Those vintage nickel-plated brass pendants are by Luigi Caccia Dominioni and the blown-glass globes in the window are by Gino Sarfatti\u2014two mid-century Italian designers known for their whimsical, yet minimalist creations made of stark metalwork and round glass. Lindsay found both at the same antique fair in Parma and quickly nabbed them, like a pro.Explore Bon App\u00e9titDesignRestaurantsSan FranciscoRead MorerestaurantsHow Tiny Lou\u2019s Turned an X-Rated History into Its Plush, Neon-Lit FutureGallery7 SlidesBy Angela HansbergercultureAre Restaurant Chairs Getting More Comfortable?By Alex BeggscultureWhat Does Your Restaurant Tote Say About You?By Alex DelanycultureWe\u2019re Obsessed With This Restaurant\u2019s Weird and Wonderful Instagram AccountBy Emily Schultz and Rachel KartenRecipes you want to make.
