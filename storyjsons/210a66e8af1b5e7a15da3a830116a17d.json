They are always welcome on a table! This recipe is presented to you by Samsung.IngredientsMakes 321cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into pieces\u00bdcup sugar1medium Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored, cut into \u00bd\" pieces1cup cake flour2tsp. kosher salt1\u00bdtsp. baking powder1\u00bdtsp. freshly ground black pepper\u00bctsp. baking soda2\u00bccups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting4oz. crumbled fresh goat cheese or finely grated sharp cheddar1\u00bccups cold heavy cream, plus more for brushingPreparationStep 1Chill butter in freezer until very cold and hard, 15\u201320 minutes.Step 2Meanwhile, spread sugar in a medium skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally from the outside edge toward the center, until sugar melts, about 3 minutes. Continue to cook, swirling pan occasionally, until syrup turns deep amber in color, about 3 minutes more. Carefully add apples to pan and spread in a single layer. Remove pan from heat and let sit until apples release some juices, absorb the caramel, and cool, about 30 minutes. Some sugar will crystallize, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s supposed to!Step 3Preheat oven to 400\u02da. Scrape apples into a fine-mesh sieve to drain excess caramel.Step 4Pulse cake flour, salt, baking powder, pepper, baking soda, and 2\u00bc cups all-purpose flour in a food processor to combine. Add frozen butter and pulse until butter is in large pea-size pieces. Do not overprocess\u2014visible pieces of butter will result in light, flaky layers.Step 5Transfer dough to a large bowl. Add drained apples and cheese. Mix with a rubber spatula to combine. Form a well in the center and pour in 1\u00bc cups cream. Mix with spatula until cream is incorporated and flour is hydrated but dough is still shaggy.Step 6Turn out dough onto a clean work surface and press together with your hands just until it forms one rough piece. Do not knead. Lightly dust work surface and dough with flour. Roll dough to an 8x8\" square. Using a sharp knife, cut dough into quarters (four 4x4\" squares), then cut each quarter into four 2x2\" squares. You should have 16 squares. Cut each square in half on a diagonal to make 32 triangles. Transfer to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet, spacing 1\" apart. Brush tops with cream.Step 7Bake scones, rotating pan halfway through, until tops are light golden brown, 18\u201320 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.Step 8Do Ahead: Unbaked scones can be formed 1 week ahead. Tightly wrap with plastic and freeze. To reheat, brush with cream as instructed and increase bake time to 20\u201325 minutes.How would you rate Cheesy Apple-Pepper Scones?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (1)Back to TopTriangleGood ideas in the recipe, but several problems as written:\n1) cooking that amount of sugar in a skillet on medium heat brings it to the \u201chard ball\u201d stage so it cannot coat the apples. A better method is to initially toss the apples with the sugar, then cook and stir on low for 3-4 minutes until apples are coated with caramel.\n2) rolling that amount of dough to an 8x8 inch square will result in dough 2 1/4 inches high (before cooking!) which would not cook properly. The recipe as written should be rolled into TWO 8 inch squares.\n3) scones without eggs are called BISCUITS \nSamsung should stick to making electronics.Los Angeles 9/8/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titSconePastriesAppleFruitGoat CheeseCheeseCheddarSnackSideNut-FreeBakingBreakfastRecipes you want to make.
