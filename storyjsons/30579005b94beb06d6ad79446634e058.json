At first glance, they could be in any Brooklyn lifestyle store: there\u2019s Fleetwood Mac on the speakers and $7 bundles of sage on the shelves. But trash\u2014 actually, a lack of trash\u2014sets Package Free Shop apart. The Williamsburg retail store is dedicated to zero-waste products, and those iconic logoed Supreme bags are the only plastic in sight.Lauren Singer, the founder of Package Free Shop, is famous for being able to keep all of her waste in a single mason jar. Like, four years of trash. In 2015, the average American generated 4.5 pounds of waste per day.Our reliance on online shopping and prepacked food isn\u2019t helping matters, but Singer is part of a burgeoning movement that aims to break the status quo and eliminate non-compostable trash. You may recall the Great Plastic Straw Debate of 2018, an Instagram-led charge to eliminate plastic straws at local coffee shops and major chains alike. Metal straws became an accessory, and the zero-waste movement was in the spotlight. Then came a larger conversation about accessibility.\u201cI got really concerned when the straw movement was happening because my granddad has Parkinsons and he can\u2019t use a metal or glass straw,\u201d says Jolene Dobson, who runs Public Goods and Services, a low-waste lifestyle shop in Seattle. \u201cAnd now that you have everybody walking around with a Hydroflask and a glass straw, you\u2019re not done. There are bigger things, like corporate responsibility for plastic packaging and overpackaging of goods in grocery stores.\u201dEven shopping for groceries is an exercise in avoiding single-use plastic, from cherry tomatoes encased in clamshells to pre-packaged chips. Customers have a choice: Find an alternative or take the hit and hope that yogurt tub gets recycled. (The chances don\u2019t look good.) Breaking the status quo takes work, and modern consumerism is built on convenience. Big box stores like Walmart and Target built empires by providing an exhaustive array of products in one place, from groceries to office supplies. Low-waste stores are considerably less comprehensive, plus locations are largely concentrated in urban areas. And even if you live close, you may have to visit three or four places to get everything you need.\u201cZero waste, in my opinion, is a full time job,\u201d says Dobson.\u201dI see these conversations online where families feel shame for using paper towels or plastic baggies, and I don\u2019t want them to feel shame.\u201d She chats with customers to assess where they can start swapping out single-use products, trading paper towels for antimicrobial cloth and plastic wrap for beeswax. \u201cEvery little step counts,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to collect your garbage in a mason jar.\u201dBut living low waste is starting to sound less utopian and more familiar. We\u2019re in a time where Brooklyners can pick up silk dental floss and a bamboo toothbrush while filling up their Mason jars with laundry detergent at Precycle, then hop on the L train to pick up eco-friendly vibrators and biodegradable glitter at Package Free Shop. Soon, a new initiative called Loop will deliver Haagen Dazs, Tide, and other bold-name brands in reusable containers to doorstops across the country. The business is billed as a return to the milkman, but its practices look like an eco challenge to Amazon.But you don\u2019t need to get another subscription to start reducing waste. Health food stores have offered up lentils and other dried goods by-the-pound for decades, as do modern chains like Whole Foods. When it comes to produce, farmers\u2019 markets are about as zero-waste as you can get.  Find for a zero-waste store near you, or revamp your current shopping routine to buy loose produce and use bulk-bins when available. Make your own granola bars. Make your own yogurt! A journey of a thousand saved plastic bags begins with a single tote bag...or something like that.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishBrooklynGroceryTrendsRead MoreLifestyle5 Stores That Make It Easy to Go Plastic-FreeBy Rachel Sugar Recipes you want to make.
