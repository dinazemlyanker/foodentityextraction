I often do all of the above\u2014and I also pour myself a fancy refreshing beverage. When I\u2019m feeling ambitious, that\u2019s a matcha Arnold Palmer, a pomegranate molasses lemonade, or a Thai iced tea with coconut condensed milk. (Welcome to Sarah\u2019s Beverage Program.) But when I want to open a bottle and get straight to drinking, it\u2019s Ume Sparkling Juice from Kimino.Photograph by Emma FishmanKimino Ume Sparkling Plum Juice$4 at Weee!$65 at Amazon (12-pack)I love all four flavors of these Japanese drinks, which are made with hand-picked seasonal fruit and water from the mountains of the Hy\u014dgo Prefecture west of Osaka. The yuzu is puckery and the Ringo apple is floral and rosy, but it\u2019s the ume that stands out for me. Tart and tingly, it\u2019s made from green ume plums\u2014which are actually more closely related to apricots\u2014and each sip starts sweet but finishes with the surprising sour savoriness of underripe stone fruit. The bubbles are fine and delicate (think Champagne). They tickle without distracting from the sweet-tart flavor that comes from a mixture of ume juice and ume pur\u00e9e.In the afternoon, I sip the chilled drink straight, willing myself to stretch the bottle out until my last meeting is over. (It is all too easy to get caught up in the wonderful refreshment and look down at an empty glass!) But once my computer is closed for the night, I\u2019ll mix the sparkling juice with a bit of gin. (I\u2019m sure that cocktail connoisseurs could come up with much more creative combinations\u2014but Sarah\u2019s Beverage Program After Dark still needs some work.)Even the empty bottles are pleasing in size and shape. I\u2019m collecting them and removing their stickers, with plans to employ them as vases for single flowers. Beauty! Simplicity! And a reminder of delicious drinks come and gone all too quickly.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
