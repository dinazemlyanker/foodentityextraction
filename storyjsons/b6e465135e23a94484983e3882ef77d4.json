Barley flour gives baked goods a silky, chewy texture, dense crumb, and butterscotch-y flavor. Want to experiment? Make these with 3\u20444 cup (80 g) einkorn flour in place of the barley flour for an even chewier blondie.IngredientsMakes 12Nonstick vegetable oil spray\u00bdcup (65 g) whole raw or toasted macadamia nuts\u00bdvanilla bean, split lengthwise18Tbsp. unsalted butter\u00becup plus 2 Tbsp. (105 g) all-purpose flour\u00becup (85 g) barley flour1\u00betsp. baking powder1\u00bdtsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00be tsp. Morton kosher salt1cup plus 7 Tbsp. (packed; 285 g) dark brown sugar2large eggs1tsp. vanilla extract2pints ice cream of choice (optional)PreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 350\u00b0. Lightly coat a 9\"-diameter cake pan with nonstick spray and line bottom with a parchment paper round. If using raw macadamia nuts, toast on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden, 8\u201310 minutes. Let cool, then coarsely chop.Step 2Scrape vanilla seeds into a small saucepan; add pod and butter. Set over medium-low heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until butter foams, then browns, 6\u20138 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl, scraping in all of the browned bits. Using tongs, remove and discard vanilla pod.Step 3Whisk all-purpose and barley flours, baking powder, and salt in another medium bowl. Add brown sugar to brown butter and stir to combine. Add eggs one at a time, stirring well after each addition. Stir in dry ingredients, then vanilla extract and nuts. Scrape batter into prepared pan; smooth top.Step 4Bake blondies, rotating halfway through, until top is golden brown and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 40\u201345 minutes. Let cool.Step 5Turn out blondies, remove parchment, and cut into 12 wedges. Serve each with a scoop of ice cream if desired.Reprinted from Mother Grains: Recipes for the Grain Revolution.

So good  and not hard to make. This recipe is a keeper.. LizGVancouver, BC3/28/2021So good! Mine collapsed a little in the middle but that was fine. So yummy. Would let cool allll the way before cutting just to minimize crumbliness.Emily Calgary, AB3/25/2021Seen this in the recent mag, and looked gorgeous. More importantly it looked quite simple and it was. I actually used the einkorn flour as I couldn't find barley flour. Nice, soft, and chewy. \ud83d\udc4dMatt1/15/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titCookieDessertBar CookieMacadamia NutNutBarleyRice & GrainsEasyBakingRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
