No, it won\u2019t be too much. Anchovies, cream, leeks, and Parmesan do magical things when baked with pasta. Anchovies bring more than just salt to the table; they add loads of umami to this rich and creamy dish.Ingredients4 - 6 Servings1lb. short pasta (such as rigatoni, penne, or conchiglie)Kosher salt\u00bccup extra-virgin olive oil3large leeks (about 1\u00bd lb.),  white and pale green parts only, trimmed, sliced \u00bd\" thick15oil-packed anchovies, drained (from a 1.5-oz. tin)6garlic cloves, thinly sliced1tsp. mild red pepper flakes or \u00bd tsp. crushed red pepper flakesFreshly ground black pepper2cups heavy cream3oz. Parmesan, finely grated,  plus more for serving110-oz. bag frozen baby peas, thawed in warm water, drainedPreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 400\u00b0. Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until very al dente, about 2 minutes less than package directions. Drain and set aside.Step 2Meanwhile, heat oil in a large Dutch oven or large high-sided skillet over medium. Add leeks; season with a couple pinches of salt. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and golden around the edges, 6\u20138 minutes. Uncover and add anchovies, garlic, red pepper flakes, and several grinds of black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until anchovies are disintegrated and garlic is tender, about 5 minutes.Step 3Add cream and 3 oz. Parmesan. Bring to a simmer; season with salt and black pepper (it should taste a bit salty because the pasta will absorb some seasoning as it bakes). Add peas and reserved pasta and toss gently to coat; top with more Parmesan. Transfer pasta to oven; bake until top is crisp and cream is bubbling around the edges, 25\u201330 minutes. Let cool slightly before serving.How would you rate Baked Pasta and Leeks With Anchovy Cream?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (34)Back to TopTriangleThis was a relatively easy weeknight meal. I made it exactly as written, and it turned out tasty and very hearty. I would liken it to an upscale tune noodle casserole.Josie L.New Orleans, LA3/4/2022Made this the other day but instead of pasta, I poured the sauce into cross-cut cooked spaghetti squash and stuck it under the broiler. Didn't have anchovies so I used a couple lil glugs of fish sauce where the anchovies would have been added in. I was worried the fish sauce might end up overpowering the dish but, just as I imagine it would with anchovies, the sauce mellowed out nicely! Still riding the high of how good it was.  Sadie2/24/2022Just made it tonight for my family. My husband loved it and so did my two year old. I did add mild Italian sausage to it,  but love the cream sauce with the anchovies. My husband has requested that I make this again. (I don't think the picture is the correct representation of this recipe, this recipe uses a white sauce.)AnonymousDallas, Texas1/21/2022Jill, I would suggest capers (if your daughter already likes/is open to trying them) as a substitute for anchovies. The result will certainly be delicious! Gianfranco CasaleBrooklyn, New York 1/11/2022Great recipe! Instead of anchovies, I substituted octopus and instead of parmesan, I used goat cheese. Rather than pasta, I thought lentils would be a good choice. I didn't have any cream, so I used some homemade chicken broth. I would definitely make this recipe again.Janice P.Chicago1/10/2022Jill, anchovies are seasoning not meatAnonymousNew Jersey, Albania12/19/2021Ok - I bet the rave reviews have a lot to do with the anchovies. I have a vegetarian daughter who loves pasta, leeks and cream ... is there any anchovy sub that would do the dish justice?Jill DonatyLos Angeles, CA9/14/2021I've made this twice and exactly as written. I LOVE this recipe, especially the crunchy bits on top! I didn't think it was overly salty at all. In fact, I'm having the leftovers for breakfast!Mary KayPrairie Village, KS8/31/2021So I didn\u2019t have everything at hand we are in a big lockdown here in Sydney Australia, so I just made do with what I had.\nI followed everything as said and took heed to people\u2019s comments and added my own thing also\nNo leeks - I used 2 very large onions \nAnchovies we\u2019re awesome as is \nDidn\u2019t have the big pasta on hand I used a packet of linguine which halved the baking time and I also put one cup of reserved pasta water and abit of extra chicken stock as we love a saucy dish \nAlso not much Parmasen I had Romano cheese thankfully and it was amazing together \nThe dish was awesome the flavour was fantastic and something I would definitely cook again \nThank you \nBellaAustralia, Sydney 8/25/2021Rinse your anchovies in a mesh strainer. It\u2019ll reduce your salt content without sacrificing flavor.  Anonymous5/11/2021Just as delicious with just a dash of cream, 1/2 lemon juice, lemon zest, and 1/2 amount of anchovy!Anonymous5/4/2021I mean yum, but why the hell does the pic look more red sauce when this is a v white sauce pasta? Y\u2019all got me confused looking at my dish like... where did I miss the mark?\n\nAnonymousChicago, IL5/2/2021This was so so good. Added some sausage cause we could. Insane. Great leftovers for lunch.  SofieSan Francisco, CA4/27/2021I took the suggestion to add pasta water due to the 'dry' comments. Added 1c to the sauce and baked for 15' covered. It was fantastic! Not dry at all and pasta still had tooth feel. I also added a little lemon zest, which was nice. Lemon juice is probably a good idea, or something acidic to cut the richness. Definitely will make it again.KGChicago4/25/2021Absolutely delicious but needs a healthy squeeze of lemon before serving.
