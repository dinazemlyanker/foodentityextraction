In the summer, she sculpts butter.By Emma MannheimerAugust 22, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailCharles Ommanney/The Washington Post/Getty ImagesFacebookTwitterEmailThe request to sculpt a stranger\u2019s head out of butter was one Sarah Pratt would have usually turned down. But it was for a surprise birthday party. Thrown for an aspiring Minnesotan dairy princess! A dream the woman had since childhood! And she had curly hair!\u201cI don't know why I did it,\u201c Pratt tells me, laughing. It seemed like an artistic opportunity.It certainly wouldn\u2019t have been her first. Head, that is. Pratt has sculpted loads of butter heads atop butter bodies\u2014Harry Potter, Captain Kirk, Monopoly\u2019s Rich Uncle Pennybags\u2014but this summer marked the first time the face of an utter stranger chilled in her refrigerator.Pratt is recounting this story for me on a sweaty August Sunday during the Iowa State Fair. It\u2019s 8:30 in morning and the fairgrounds are showing signs of deep-fried life. Pickledawgs slumber gently in ham blankets waiting to be dropped in oil at the Dawghouse Concessions stand, while down the road, syrupy pieces of cherry pie will be skewered then, duh, fried. We\u2019re standing near a glass-front cooler observing Pratt\u2019s most celebrated creation, the icon of America\u2019s most American state fair: the Iowa State Fair Butter Cow.Close your eyes and envision a life-size cow, perfect in every bovine respect\u2014back straighter than the edge of a cardboard milk carton, udder attached high and wide\u2014only, carved from enough butter to slather 19,200 pieces of toast (around 500 pounds). It\u2019d probably look a lot like what I\u2019m staring at. \u201cIt\u2019s intended to be the ideal cow,\u201d Pratt explains. \u201cGenerally, even the grand champion [cow] doesn\u2019t even have all of those aspects.\u201dPratt and the butter cow in-process.\nAP Photo/Charlie NeibergallBorn in the tiny town of Toledo, Iowa, Pratt is the fifth-ever appointed Butter Cow sculptor in the fair\u2019s history, a tradition thought up in 1911 as a promotional feat for the golden fat as well as for Midwest dairy farmers. Pratt, 41, doesn\u2019t remember a time visiting the fair as a kid and not seeing the meta, milk-made cow. It wasn\u2019t until age 14 she got hands-on. While assisting a friend who competed in 4-H, a teen-aged Pratt bombed at real-life cow tasks and was herded to the cooler where she could presumably do the least damage. There, the legendary Norma \u201cDuffy\u201d Lyon\u2014the great aunt of her 4-H friend, fellow Toledo local, and 45-year veteran Butter Cow carver\u2014coached Pratt in softening 1,000-plus pounds of frozen butter into a pliable medium, the ins and outs of the tools needed to craft everything from sweetly staring cow eyes to individual tail hairs, and creative problem solving (\u201cWhat would Norma do?\u201d). More than the butter stuck: For 14 consecutive summers, Lyon called her budding apprentice back.Glorious.\nJohn Dominis/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty ImagesPratt studied under Lyon until age 28, when she was handed the reins to go solo. Now, a grade school special education teacher by fall-winter-spring and butter artist by summer, she makes the rounds chiseling locally sourced salted (it acts as a preservative) butter at the Kansas, Illinois, and Iowa state fairs. This is the 13th year she\u2019s designed Iowa\u2019s dairy darling, welding the metal-and-wire armature that supports the sculpture, then tooling the oily form of a Jersey cow (\u201cThe sweetest cow of them all\u201d) onto it with bare hands.Surveying her chef d'oeuvre from within the 40-degree cooler, Pratt absentmindedly works a handful of butter. It emits squelching noises with each knead and the air surrounding us is flavored like obscenely ripe blue cheese\u2014the gross smell of decade-old butter reused annually, becoming progressively smoother with each carving.\u201cThe face is kind of my favorite but it\u2019s also been my greatest nemesis,\u201d she says thoughtfully. \u201cYou think you know what something looks like until you try to recreate it.\u201d With no arts degree, Pratt is self-taught in all aspects of the job: from the nuances of different cow breeds to the techniques required to translate lifelike musculature through a dairy-based spread. This year, she also carved a 1918 John Deere tractor for the fair.If the weird world of butter sculpting strikes you as something that belongs to a select group of individuals, good call. \u201cThere might be half a dozen butter sculptors in the nation. I look at their sculptures online, but we\u2019ve never been in the same place at the same time,\u201d Pratt says. Yet she is slowly changing that by developing sculpting curriculum to share and teach the centuries-old art form locally at schools in West Des Moines.In many ways, Pratt sees butter akin to traditional mediums like clay. The one undeniable difference (aside from the fact it\u2019s the only delicious one) is the ephemeral nature of the stuff\u2014the sculptures are dismantled and turned back into, well, butter at the fair\u2019s end, bucketed and locked in a deep freeze near the edge of town until next year. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like life,\u201d she says. \u201cYou build up a life, then something\u2019s gonna happen, and you just build it up again. Yeah, it\u2019s a process but there\u2019s beauty in that process, I think.\u201dWe shake hands as I depart the cooler, slightly numbed. Stepping into the sunlight, a slick sheen of butter glitters on my hand.Related: What It's Like to Be a Professional Chocolate TasterSculpt butter\u2014or make your own, like Brad:Explore Bon App\u00e9titButterIowaRecipes you want to make.
