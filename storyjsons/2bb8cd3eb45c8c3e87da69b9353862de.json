Buy your tickets now.A few weeks ago on Mother\u2019s Day, my wife and I found ourselves with a free afternoon. Our son was off on an all-day playdate, so we decided to make the most of it. Simone signed us up for a 12 p.m. yoga class (her idea) followed by lunch at a brothy, spicy, veg-centric Japanese curry spot around the corner (also her idea).Ten years ago, I might have scoffed and eye-rolled at our itinerary. But people change. Even ones like me, who never think they do.Over the last few years, I\u2019ve become the guy who reaches for a green juice (extra ginger, please) on those days when I need a boost. On nights when I\u2019m not mixing myself a cocktail, I pour myself a fizzy kombucha on the rocks, and tell myself that it tastes like p\u00e9t-nat.I\u2019ve got a trainer. I sneak off to yoga when I can.Photo by Alex LauI do all of this not because it\u2019s in vogue (although, it is), but because it makes me feel good. Really good. And it\u2019s this way of thinking\u2014enjoy the good things in life, while balancing them with the good-for-you things in life\u2014that fuels our Healthyish website. Have you checked out Healthyish? I\u2019m consistently amazed at what a diverse spectrum of people come not just for straight-up delicious recipes, but to talk about wellness in a straight-up, down-to-earth way.I\u2019d like to take credit for the rapid-fire success of Healthyish, but the kudos go to editor Amanda Shapiro, who has infused it with its infectious personality and purpose.And it\u2019s Shapiro who, last year, asked the question: What if we brought Healthyish to life? Funny how a simple query can lead to something big.Saturday, June 9 is the first-ever Healthyish Homecoming, a day-long festival of talks, food, and drink here in New York City. There will be panels and seminars, featuring folks like New York Times writer and podcast host Jenna Wortham and Dining In cookbook dynamo Alison Roman (of The Cookies fame). Grammy Award-winning actress Cynthia Erivo will be there. And Nic Jammet, co-founder of Sweetgreen. And many, many more.Photo by Rachel KartenNot that it\u2019s all talking. Heather Sperling and Emily Fiffer, of LA\u2019s favorite Healthyish restaurant, Botanica, will be making lunch for everybody. And because being healthy isn\u2019t much fun without a side order of ish, Hanna Black and Carla Perez-Gallardo from Lil\u2019 Deb\u2019s Oasis up in Hudson, New York, will be serving up cocktails and snacks at day\u2019s end.Oh yeah, and for people like me, who can\u2019t sit still for more than 30 minutes, Chloe Kernaghan from Sky Ting Yoga will be there to lead us through some \u201cactive moments\u201d throughout the day.I\u2019ll be honest, Healthyish Homecoming is the kind of thing I never would have considered going to 10 years ago. Which is exactly why I\u2019ll be there come next Saturday. Buy your tickets here and join us.Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
