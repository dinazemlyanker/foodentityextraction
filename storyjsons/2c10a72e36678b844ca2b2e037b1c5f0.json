Here\u2019s how each of them met the moment.By The Bon App\u00e9tit StaffSeptember 30, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailThis article is part of our series on how restaurants changed in 2020, and why we've never loved them more. Click to see all the stories.It\u2019s hard to imagine that about a year ago we were crammed in a big warehouse in Brooklyn with 2,000 other food lovers, celebrating the Hot 10, America\u2019s Best New Restaurants of 2019. Back then, Kopitiam was looking to expand to two more locations in New York City, and Khao Noodle Shop was planning to open a second restaurant in Dallas. Instead, a global pandemic brought the entire industry to its knees. No restaurant was immune, including the ones on our list. Restaurants were forced to close, furlough employees, figure out takeout and delivery, apply for confusing loans, and generally rethink how they operate not only to survive but to keep doing what they love. We always enjoy catching up with the Hot 10 family from years past, but now more than ever, we wanted to know how they were getting through these trying times.Photo by Alex LauNo. 1: Konbi in Los AngelesAkira Akuto, chef and co-owner: When the Hot 10 came out, we expected a big hit. Managing that demand was difficult. We have a small space, which is always crowded, but we\u2019re used to that kind of problem-solving. That\u2019s always been a thing for Konbi.When COVID-19 hit, we got PPP early (Editor\u2019s note: PPP, the Paycheck Protection Program, is a forgivable loan that pays for payroll, rent, and utilities under specific conditions, like hiring back all employees. If those conditions aren\u2019t met, then the loan needs to be paid back in two years). We were fortunate. We paid our people to stay home, while Nick and I decided to do maintenance work. With such a busy fall, the space was falling apart. Over the course of a couple months, we cleared the space, redid the floors, restructured the management system, and rebuilt the space as takeout only.Nick Montgomery, chef and co-owner: When we reopened in the first week of June, people were excited to have the foods they loved available again. It was nice to make people happy. That\u2019s a big part of what we want to do at Konbi\u2014bring joy.Service is one hundred percent takeout now. We hope we can bring back what Konbi was before, but we\u2019re just fortunate to have our take-out window. We have online ordering, which we\u2019ve never done before.AA: It was basically like opening a pop-up. We worked through it all theoretically, expecting to make changes once it actually opened. At this point we\u2019re only down 8 or 9% from our numbers last year, which is definitely lucky.NM: Supply chain is tough, though. Deliveries are less frequent, and only half of the vendors are showing up at the farmers market. We have to keep more on hand at the restaurant, but we can\u2019t plug in another fridge. We\u2019d flip the breaker.AA: We\u2019ve found the next level of limitations of Konbi. We maxed out storage. The menu is as big as it can be. If something new comes on, something has to leave.NM: But we\u2019ve tried hard to not let the situation stop us from doing what we normally do.AA: Yeah, it\u2019s been a lot of logistical stuff we\u2019ve never thought about. But we\u2019re open. I think that\u2019s a big driver of Konbi\u2019s success: We\u2019re always willing to change. \u2013As told to Alex DelanyPhoto by Alex LauNo. 2: Khao Noodle Shop in DallasDonny Sirisavath, chef-owner: 2020 was supposed to be an awesome year for us: We had lines out the door, collaboration events planned with other Hot 10 winners, and a new concept coming called Khao Len, which was going to be all about \u201cplayful food\u201d from our childhoods, like ramen burgers and roti tacos.We had just started looking for a location when all hell broke loose. Like, you think you\u2019re the No. 2 restaurant in the nation? Well, here comes COVID-19. Accolades don\u2019t mean shit in a global pandemic. We shut down in March and quickly pivoted to a take-out model. We hadn\u2019t done that before because dine-in was our whole thing: open kitchen, communal tables\u2014it was all about the full experience. That all changed as we scrambled to figure out how to take orders, how to portion, how to travel. Initially, I was doing deliveries myself in my old classic Land Cruiser\u2014my baby! I didn\u2019t want to switch to an outside delivery service because they don\u2019t care about the food. But now I\u2019m using Favor [a Texas-based delivery platform] because I know each dish will get to customers fresh.We\u2019re also selling dry goods, like our beef jerky and sauces, in our new Khaovenience Mart, along with imported Asian snacks and ingredients and fresh produce from local farmers. I feel like I\u2019m my mom now, making and selling anything and everything I can think of, like a true immigrant. Finding a way to survive.There are days I\u2019m super depressed and stressed-out. Some days we\u2019re making as little as $100 in profit. We blew through our PPP loan and I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re gonna pay it back next year; our landlord was charging us half rent, but this is the last month before we have to pay in full again. That\u2019s why we had to open up our patio, start doing dine-in again as safely as possible. It\u2019s heartbreaking to see restaurants suffer like this. We need to pass the Restaurants Act or our industry is going to be a dying breed. I\u2019m especially worried for the mom-and-pop restaurants. But I\u2019m grateful for my team and my customers. My mom always taught me there are bumps in the road but you can\u2019t go backward\u2014you have to keep moving forward. It\u2019s all you can do. \u2013As told to Hilary CadiganPhoto by Emma FishmanNo. 3: Longoven in Richmond, VAPatrick Phelan, chef and co-owner: The Hot 10 recognition put a lot of eyes on us and the city of Richmond. A lot more people came; some people had never tried a tasting menu before. Like all restaurants, after October, we did this mad race to February, which is the end of the holiday season (Valentine\u2019s Day). Then the pandemic came in March. We went from 110 mph to zero.We closed the restaurant and had to lay everyone off. We got PPP, and I jumped into advocacy once my good friend Steven Satterfield introduced me to the IRC (Independent Restaurant Coalition). We slowly survived; we started doing meal donations in May and other things, but at a certain point we were like, There is nothing worse than letting a restaurant sit. In June, we got a small team together, about seven of us, and put together a menu and began to offer a to-go experience as well as patio dining. Andrew [Manning, co-chef and co-owner] brought back his old concept, Brasa, a wood-fired grill pop-up. Meg [Fitzroy, pastry chef and co-owner] and Meredith [Herrera, pastry chef] started a bakery, Fitzroy & Herrera, out of the window by the pass. We leaned on our pop-up experience, so it wasn\u2019t a big deal putting a menu together each week. It got us excited.If there is any silver lining in this pandemic, it\u2019s been this opportunity to reflect. We\u2019ve been thinking a lot about equity in the restaurant\u2014what someone makes in the FOH compared to the BOH, the hours we all work. The pandemic has drawn back the curtains. So this time has been great to challenge the norms, structure, and hierarchy of restaurants. I have no idea what the restaurant will look like in the future and what the hell we\u2019re going to do for winter, but if we can make it through this, that\u2019s huge. \u2013As told to Elyse InaminePhoto by Michael Graydon + Nikole HerriottNo. 4: Ochre Bakery in DetroitJessica Hicks, co-owner: We shut down right before it became mandatory in Michigan. Everything felt very insecure and the staff wasn\u2019t comfortable. Then the schools closed. My husband [co-owner Daisuke Hughes] and I have two little kids and three businesses, which meant that it was basically impossible for us to remain sane and both work full-time. So we took it as an opportunity to really spend time with our family and reevaluate our priorities.Early on I was worried about the farming community; it was March so a lot of people had already bought crops for this year. But I talked with farmers about ways to survive without restaurants, and it turns out that because people were cooking at home more and not wanting to go to supermarkets, the direct-to-consumer relationships were working really well. That was a relief; it made me feel less pressure to reopen. And most of our staff were making more on unemployment then they would\u2019ve working for us.For about two months we did a series of scaled-back Saturday pop-ups. They were scarily successful\u2014having huge crowds of people lining up almost felt irresponsible. After George Floyd was murdered, we did a bunch of fundraising events; our staff would donate their time, and 50 percent of everything we made went to local organizations like the Detroit Justice Center and Detroit People\u2019s Food Co-op.You know, I opened this bakery wanting to have a positive effect, but we felt like a mirage in a food desert. We weren\u2019t accessible in the ways I wanted us to be. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an easy solution when you\u2019re trying to use good quality ingredients and pay people well\u2014it\u2019s complicated\u2014but going forward we\u2019re focusing on food security for our community and upping our employees\u2019 quality of life.To do that, we\u2019re becoming more of a grocery store with relaxed food options\u2014no more plated made-to-order dishes. We\u2019re limiting what we\u2019re making so we can be more efficient. We\u2019re selling in bulk to minimize labor and maximize affordability: organic lentils, big containers of olive oil, 50-pound bags of flour. If we have kohlrabi from the farm down the street, we\u2019ll also provide recipes so people know what to do with it. We\u2019ll still sell birthday cakes and dips and soups and sandwiches, but it won\u2019t be as precious anymore, and we\u2019ll offer day-old bread at reduced rates. We\u2019ve applied to accept EBT cards, which means changing our offerings and upping the ratio of bread we sell to qualify.I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I don\u2019t ever want to run a traditional restaurant again. Ochre has been magical, but it nearly drove me crazy\u2014and I lost my appendix in the process. This pandemic has made me realize the importance of prioritizing space for life. In this industry it\u2019s really easy to just get on that hamster wheel of working and not even realizing when you need to stop. But you do need to stop sometimes. You need to hold yourself accountable. You need to set boundaries. \u2014As told to Hilary CadiganPhoto by Alex LauNo. 5: The Elysian Bar in New OrleansAlex Harrell, chef: Before COVID-19, we were rolling into the high season. From New Year\u2019s Eve all the way into June, you have Mardi Gras, the French Quarter Festival, the Jazz and Heritage Festival, and very large university graduations, which all carry your business into the summer. In early March, we had just finalized our first spring menu change, and we were excited about the local produce coming in. Then we shut down.The entire staff was furloughed until we received our PPP loan. When everyone was back on payroll in June, we started doing takeout and contactless curbside pick-up for family-style meals. We had a little success, and we began offering outdoor dining. But once restaurants in New Orleans started doing cocktails, we had an uptick in cases, so the city shut booze service down. A lot of restaurants operate at a 60-40 profit split between food and booze, but for us\u2014with such a big bar program\u2014it\u2019s more like 50-50. We definitely felt that hit, especially with the hotel being empty. The hotel has 71 rooms, and maybe 25 percent of business on weekends came from hotel guests. We really missed those guests.But the summer humidity and heat are disappearing, which brings more people out. The Saints are back to playing football. The city feels like it\u2019s starting to come alive again. We\u2019re still in phase two out of four, which limits indoor dining to 50 percent capacity without bar seating. Our staff looks at this as a new challenge. We all want to get back to cooking and serving the type of food we enjoy. The kitchen is excited again. Now it\u2019s a matter of continuing to be smart and safe, keeping our fingers crossed, and doing our best. \u2013As told to Alex DelanyPhoto by Alex LauNo. 6: Kopitiam in New York CityMoonlynn Tsai, general manager and co-owner: I remember the issue came out on a random Tuesday, in the middle of the week. Tuesdays are usually pretty mellow at Kopitiam, but that day we were just packed\u2014it was like weekend crowds on a weekday. I remember feeling like it was a new beginning for the restaurant.Kyo Pang, chef and co-owner: We had to double up on a lot of the menu items we were selling: kaya toast, pandan chicken, things like that. On a regular day we\u2019d have about 200 covers; after the Hot 10, we went up to more than 300 covers a day.We were thinking about ways to expand, so we checked out two new locations, one on the Lower East Side and one in Brooklyn. But because of COVID-19, all of that stopped. We didn\u2019t even know what was going to happen with Kopitiam. The week after the citywide lockdown in March, we saw a drop-off of 40 percent.MT: At the time, getting 10 orders a day was a cause for celebration. Before the pandemic, we had reached the point where we felt like Kopitiam was growing legs, that we were toddlers now and that we could let go a little bit. But then when the pandemic hit, we had to furlough everybody.It was very important to us to take care of our team even as they were furloughed and distancing at home, because they had all been living paycheck to paycheck. I\u2019m so proud that we were able to pay both our front- and back-of-house staff in full for a month before unemployment benefits started coming in. We did that entirely through sales, not through a restaurant fund. We started selling our coffee, merch, nasi lemak kits, anything we could think of. But people were so excited to find ways to support us that I think we did close to 500 percent of what we used to do in retail sales.Now, we\u2019re slowly bringing back a few people to help us. I\u2019m still at the restaurant every day, and then on Wednesdays [my partner] Yin and I operate Heart of Dinner. I\u2019ve never played tetris with time so well in my life.The restaurant industry is generally very supportive, but receiving so much love and care from this community has been really inspiring. Without our government stepping in, I\u2019m very scared for what will happen in the winter when all these grants are gone and it starts getting colder and things like food insecurity will only get worse. But I\u2019m proud to see companies like Rethink Food pivoting so fast to support more people and all the industry coalitions like ROAR. The landscape is going to change for sure\u2014a lot of restaurants [here in Chinatown] have shuttered permanently. It\u2019s going to look so different, but we\u2019re hopeful; Chinatown is really resilient. \u2013As told to Christina ChaeyPhoto by Marcus NilssonNo. 7: Tailor in NashvilleVivek Surti, chef and co-owner: We had been open for about 10 months, and we were doing well, not killing it. But after the Hot 10 came out, our business doubled. We had a full dining room, 30 people at each of our two seatings. The whole room came to life. Every month was getting better and better.Then March came. A tornado hit Nashville on March 3; luckily we weren\u2019t affected but many restaurants within a block of us were. We had to close because we lost power. A few days after we came back for service, on March 15, the mayor held a press conference about coronavirus and we suddenly got all these calls and emails about wanting to cancel reservations. On March 23, the stay-at-home order was issued.[Co-owner] Heather Southerland and I came together to figure out what to do. Our main priority was taking care of our employees. We kept all 11 on payroll (our PPP loan helped). We considered takeout, but we didn\u2019t feel safe with people being in close quarters. Plus, the restaurant is more of an experience thing. So we took it week by week, watching what was happening to figure out the best time to reopen with the right processes in place.We reopened on August 6 with one seating at 7 p.m. that you reserved and paid for ahead of time. We sanitized surfaces before and after service, checked and logged the temperatures for every person who stepped in the building, and everyone wore masks. We shared our protocols with diners, but we also welcomed them like we always do and told them the story behind the dishes. One person who came said, \u201cAfter four months, I feel human again.\u201dThis one-seating model allows us to take our time and focus on each dish; it feels like we\u2019re reconnecting with cooking. That\u2019s rewarding when you\u2019ve spent a year being \u201cgo, go, go, go.\u201d At the same time we\u2019re able to continue providing a comfortable place for people and promoting South Asian-American food and first-generation cuisine. We don\u2019t know what the future holds, but we\u2019re sticking to what we do best. We have plans if that doesn\u2019t work, but we\u2019re hoping it does. \u2013As told to Elyse InaminePhoto by Alex LauNo. 8: Le Comptoir du Vin in BaltimoreRosemary Liss and Will Mester, chefs and co-owners: As a restaurant, we\u2019ve completely shifted gears. March 14 was our last night of service, and the next week was really crazy, like, \u201cWhat the hell are we gonna do?\u201d Our dining room is tiny, so we couldn\u2019t do dine-in anymore, and we had to furlough everyone but Kelsey Martin, our sous-chef and baker.In those early days people were going hard, stocking pantries with booze, so we acted fast by photographing all the wine, putting it up for sale on our website, offering curbside pick-up. Selling off our inventory is what saved us. We built the business back up from there, working with more and more importers and distributors; making sandwiches with Kelsey\u2019s house-baked focaccia; selling prepared foods like our p\u00e2t\u00e9, imported products like tinned anchovies and French salt and really nice vinegars, and of course, wine\u2014which we can get really wild with now that we aren\u2019t so constrained by food pairings. In August, we shut down for two weeks, and a carpenter friend built shelves and a wine rack, which completely transformed our space. We\u2019ve essentially become a shop\u2014and it\u2019s been enormously satisfying!After our BA feature last year, we got really busy. People would come for birthdays and special occasions, and because we\u2019re so small, we\u2019d get booked out a month in advance. Since COVID-19, we\u2019ve become more of a neighborhood spot, more relaxed with people popping in for a sandwich and a bottle of wine. We\u2019re building out a small patio in the back, which should open this fall. We\u2019ll serve wine and charcuterie, and we\u2019ll have a heater so we can keep it open year-round, like they do at caf\u00e9s in France where people sit outside with blankets, smoking and drinking and enjoying each other\u2019s company, no matter the temperature.COVID has forced us to make changes quickly, and that\u2019s been terrifying, but it\u2019s also given us a chance to stop grinding for a second, to think about how to thrive within these constraints. How to turn these changes into something sustainable. How to rebuild something that lasts but also has the ability to evolve. \u2013As told to Hilary CadiganPhoto by Laura MurrayNo. 9: Matt\u2019s BBQ Tacos in Portland, ORMatt Vicedomini, chef-owner: We couldn\u2019t make enough food, especially after the Hot 10. There was a never-ending line. But in early March, everyone could sense something. We saw what was happening in Italy, and we didn\u2019t know what the government\u2019s plan was here. I started reaching out to the health department to ask about good protocols. Not to criticize them, but I got the sense that no one knew what the hell was going on. So we shut down, along with pretty much every other restaurant.I played a lot of video games. I stressed-out. I researched online ordering and built a new website and checked the news every hour. I paid for our employees PTO and health insurance during that month\u2014we got PPP to help with payroll and stuff\u2014but I realized we needed to open because of all the expenses.Around late April, we opened for online ordering only. For the first two weeks, we offered preset barbecue taco dinners, just 50 orders a day and spacing out pick-ups so every 15 minutes we had no more than five customers at a time. After that we transitioned to a more normal menu for breakfast and lunch, again only online orders and spacing out pick-ups.Since we\u2019re a food cart, we\u2019re built for to-go and social distancing. We\u2019re doing about two-thirds of our normal volume, which I feel great about. We\u2019ve brought back almost the entire staff. All things considered, we\u2019re in pretty good shape. I could share with you the new juices that I\u2019m making or the 5,000-square-foot warehouse I bought pre-COVID-19 that we\u2019re still turning into a barbecue production kitchen, but that just doesn\u2019t feel right. My only goal is to make it through the other side. \u2013As told to Elyse InaminePhoto by Alex LauNo. 10: The Wolf\u2019s Tailor in DenverKelly Whitaker, chef and restaurateur: We had a total shutdown on April 1, and the Wolf\u2019s Tailor immediately went from being the busiest restaurant in our restaurant group to nothing. We weren\u2019t super established, and our food didn\u2019t travel well whereas our other restaurants held strong because people were already used to ordering takeout from there.When we reopened Wolf at the beginning of May, we only served tasting menus at $45 a head. Since we\u2019re a small-format restaurant to begin with and we\u2019re now only able to seat at 50 percent capacity, having someone take up a table to just have a Negroni doesn\u2019t financially make sense for us.Now that we\u2019re seeing more people who are comfortable coming in with small groups, we\u2019re going to bring back our donabe, which have always been a big part of this restaurant. We\u2019re going to have two heated tents outside all winter that can each seat four to six people, and it\u2019s going to be like Colorado glamping with donabe, focusing on this one-pot meal with some sides.We also launched a grain mill and have started selling flour wholesale to chefs as well as to consumers all over the U.S. Five years ago we planted 200 acres of five varieties of heirloom grains with our farmers. I\u2019m now sitting on 500,000 pounds of grains. At the beginning of the pandemic, we started selling a ton of flour at [our bakery and mill] Dry Storage. People would come in and buy 20 pounds at a time and we\u2019d be like, \u201cUm, do you have a restaurant?\u201d and they\u2019d be like, \u201cNo, I\u2019m baking!\u201d I think the whole sourdough bread craze that happened at the beginning of the pandemic is going to come back for the winter. We now sell kilo bags to the consumer, and I have a whole facility in Boulder where we mill flour for chefs.Right now, we\u2019re thinking about how to have big conversations about the city of Denver. We\u2019re in a pivotal election year, so through the end of the year our restaurant group is going to focus on some of these issues, such as rethinking our supply chains, which is why the grain mill is a big thing for us right now. And at least through the election, we\u2019ll be running [our retail shop and restaurant] Brut\u00f8 as an advocacy kitchen to host pop-ups from our chefs and friends in the industry. We went from questioning our existence altogether to starting the advocacy kitchen and a flour mill, and it\u2019s been awesome to see our team get more excited than ever before about what we\u2019re doing. \u2013As told to Christina ChaeyExplore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsChefsCoronavirusRecipes you want to make.
