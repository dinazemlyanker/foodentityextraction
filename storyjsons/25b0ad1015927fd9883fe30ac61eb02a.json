For an extra savory note, add a big pinch of asafetida to the melted ghee when you add the seeds.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Top with cilantro; serve with lime wedges.How would you rate Dal Palak?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (11)Back to TopTriangleGreat comfort food.  Red lentils come in various sizes, if you're using the tiny ones, cut the cooking time in 1/2.AnonymousSt. Helena, CA1/14/2022I thought it was going to be soup but it wasn't after another five minutes of cooking.  Very nice texture and delicious over rice.  The use of whole seeds instead of ground really makes this a special dish.  Leave out the chile if you don't like it hot or someone in your party has an intolerance.Lisa E12/5/2021Check your lentils for doneness well before 25 minutes! I neglected to do that, and my lentils turned into complete mush. Otherwise, this was tasty. I did double the seasonings as suggested by another reviewer.AnonymousSeattle, WA12/2/2021Not bad.  More like a lunch rather than a weeknight dinner.  I will make this again because I'm always looking for different ways to use lentils!LA KittyLos Angeles, CA11/19/2021We enjoyed this.  Used some chopped kale and some baby spinach.  Our end result was much less vividly yellow, though.  Reminded me how good dal can be!  BuckysmomHouston, TX 11/15/2021This was an easy and healthy weeknight dish, but mine was not nearly flavorful enough. I used a whole bag of baby spinach -- could that have diluted the flavor? Going to make it again and double or triple the spice quantities. AnonymousNYC11/8/2021We loved this recipe. The return on flavour is double that of the preparation. So flavourful and warming. I made it for the first time last night and it disappeared so made another batch for lunches this morning. Highly recommended!AnonymousToronto, Canada11/4/2021I subbed lime for with tamarind paste because for some reason limes are a dollar apiece recently and it was delicious. \n\nPrevious commenter Helen asks if it can be a 1 pot meal - my opinion is yes, it will work - but the techniques used do change the  flavors. If I were to simplify, I'd cook onions/ginger/fennel in advance, then add lentils and water (skim as best you can until they stop foaming) and add turmeric/salt/lime after skimming - then put spinach on to steam at the end - but I'd still  fry mustard/cumin/hot pepper/garlic in ghee or oil separately and add last (look up Tadka). I always use the same small cast iron skillet for this step and just wipe it out afterwards so cleanup is super easy. SarahKalamazoo11/2/2021Can I cook the spice mixture first and throw the lentils and water with it to cook together?  Just want to see if I can make it a one pot meal.HelenCalifornia10/25/2021Fantastic recipe! Easy, delicious and flavorful. I added a green chili to the garlic/ginger, and had to use part toor dal due to what I had on hand. I added around 1/2 cup extra water at the end for our desired consistency. It was a hit! Will become part of our regular meal planning. PoojaSt. Paul, MN10/25/2021Great recipe! Very fast and easy. Added more salt and more chili\u2019s for heat.AnonymousArcata, CA10/24/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titLentilVegetableSpinachLeafy GreensStewSoups and StewsDinnerVegetarianWeeknightQuickEasyRecipes you want to make.
