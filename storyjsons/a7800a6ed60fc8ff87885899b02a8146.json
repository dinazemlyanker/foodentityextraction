It\u2019s 7:13 a.m., and here\u2019s what\u2019s on the to-do list for the head baker at The Freehand hotel in New York City: train a new hire on how to make 15 or so doughs, from her years-in-the-making chocolate morning bun to the new flaky seaweed bread, for all-day cafe Studio, neighborhood-y restaurant Simon & The Whale, and sleek bar George Washington Bar. She\u2019s wearing a tan apron, white clogs (with pink argyle socks), and a light blue bandana with the bow tied right above her forehead, the Christina Tosi way, a relic of her tenure at Milk Bar.At a small metal prep table downstairs in the commissary kitchen, she stretches out the balls of simit dough and dunks them in thinned-out grape molasses. Then she turns around and pokes the proofing croissant dough. \u201cGive them another five minutes, so they\u2019re not so jiggly,\u201d she says to another baker. She takes a tray of flatbread dough blobs, flags me (yet another thing to keep her eye on this morning), and heads up the stairs to Simon & The Whale.The Freehand\u2019s ground-floor restaurant is totally empty and silent this morning, except for one click as Kanan flicks a button that heats up the deep fryer. \u201cThis is my favorite part of the morning,\u201d she says as she rips holes in the flatbread and drops them into the hot oil.The rhurbarb-y Persian love cake\nAlex LauThe Freehand wasn\u2019t supposed to have a head baker. But last November, as restaurateur Gabe Stulman was opening three new concepts inside the hotel, he met Kanan at Christina Tosi\u2019s urging and created the role just for her. A head baker isn\u2019t flashy and show-stopping like a pastry chef, who leaves the final impression on the diner, or review-worthy like an executive chef, who attracts critics like magnets. Rather the role of the head baker is to be the ultimate collaborator, to make everyone else\u2019s food shine. And Kanan does just that with black bread and pita for dips, laminated seaweed bread for sandwiches, and craveworthy cookies and cakes for filling a glass display. Kanan, 28, relishes in that duty and takes it seriously.But a funny thing happened. Those carby goods, which were intended as accompaniments, supporting actors, became the things people were talking about. She\u2019s become the breakout star, despite not having more than a small prep table, no previous name recognition, and a quirky sensibility that leads her to put seaweed in bread dough.Kanan frying Moroccan doughnuts\nAlex LauAs a kid, Kanan imagined herself somewhere else, far from deep fryers and claustrophobic kitchens: on Olympic ice. Growing up in The Heights in Houston, Kanan woke up at 4 a.m. everyday to drive to Sugarland to skate for a few hours before going to school. (Tara Lipinski trained at her rink.) But when she broke her arm right before qualifying for senior competition (a.k.a. Olympic level), she felt a sense of relief. \u201cI was looking for an out,\u201d she says. Plus, she had other interests that she wanted to explore: film, music, and, of course, sweets.In the summer of 2009, she convinced her parents to let her go to pastry school at the French Culinary Institute in New York City. Before she even started her program, Kanan knew she wanted to work at Milk Bar, which she read everything she could on food sites like Eater and Grubstreet.Her resume is a who\u2019s who of the best desserts in New York City: frosting wedding cakes under Tosi at Milk Bar, crimping pies at Four & Twenty Blackbirds, and honing in on laminated pastries at Vaucluse. Eventually she returned to the things her grandmother baked\u2014babkas, honey cakes, and bagels\u2014and perfected them alongside pastry chef Melissa Weller at Sadelle\u2019s.The full spread at Studio\nAlex Lau\u201cIn the ten years of Milk Bar, we\u2019ve had incredible talent come through, but there are few people that I\u2019m like, \u2018They\u2019re going to do something.\u2019\u201d Christina Tosi tells me later on over the phone. \u201cWith Zoe, I definitely thought that. Everything she makes is warm, soulful, and clever. She respects tradition but looks for something new, something that hasn\u2019t been discovered before.\u201dIt\u2019s that drive and determination that led her to the Freehand, where she oversees a team of four. At Studio, the dreamy, lounge-y restaurant on the second floor of The Freehand, everything builds up to 8 a.m. That\u2019s when Kanan sets up a small glass box on the bar top and carefully fills it with everything from downstairs. Airy sourdough croissants, so impressive that they apparently upset her French customers. (They\u2019re that perfect.) Chocolate morning buns, a \u201cbrownie meets a croissant,\u201d per an enthusiastic server. Cakey chocolate babkas for all the purists out there who turn their noses at the proliferation of croissant-like babkas. Beautiful cakes, like a rose-scented Persian love cake. Chocolate chip cookies, packed with whole-wheat flour, oats, millet, polenta, and sunflower seeds. \u201cLike a healthy version of the Compost Cookie,\u201d Kanan says. (You\u2019ll know what she means once you bite into them\u2014get the recipe here.)Kanan\u2019s grain-packed cookie, an unintentional ode to Tosi\u2019s Compost Cookie\nAlex LauA customer walks up to hand Kanan an empty espresso cup, which she plops into a bin full of dirty plates with a smile. She pushes the empty baked goods cart towards the service elevator that will take her back to the production kitchen. As she waits, she checks her phone. Her bakers text madly with updates on proofing dough and the 300 pitas that need her prompt attention. Her day is only beginning.Get that cookie recipe:Multigrain Chocolate Chip CookiesYes, there are multi ingredients in these multigrain cookies, but that\u2019s what makes them so over the top.View RecipeUpgrade your bread game:Explore Bon App\u00e9titBreadRestaurants + TravelRead MorerestaurantsThe Mysterious and Magical World of Burrow, a Japanese Bakery Hiding In an Office LobbyBy Elyse InaminecookingThe 10 Baking Questions People Ask Me Literally All the Time, AnsweredBy Claire SaffitzcultureInside the National Pie Championships: Keep Calm and Carry Cool WhipBy Claire McNeillRecipes you want to make.
