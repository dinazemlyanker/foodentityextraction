Treat it like cranberry sauce\u2013it goes with everything. Labneh is made by taking strained yogurt and straining it again so you\u2019re left with something extra thick and rich. It can accommodate all the lemon and orange juice while retaining enough body to be scooped up with hot parathas. If all you have is Greek yogurt, that will work too, just know you\u2019ll end up with a thinner raita. This recipe is part of Sohla El-Waylly\u2019s Thanksgiving-for-two-or-maybe-eight feast, see the full menu here.IngredientsMakes about 2\u00bd cups2cups labneh1\u00bdtsp. finely grated orange zest1\u00bdtsp. finely grated lemon zest\u00bccup fresh orange juice2Tbsp. fresh lemon juice1Tbsp. finely grated peeled ginger1Tbsp. sugarKosher salt1Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil1tsp. coriander seeds, crushed\u00bdtsp. ground turmeric\u00bdtsp.
