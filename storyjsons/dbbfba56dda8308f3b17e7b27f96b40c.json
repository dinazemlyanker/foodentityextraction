The key is to not overcook them. You\u2019re shooting for an internal temperature that\u2019s just shy of 135\u00b0F, which will yield meat that\u2019s just-opaque and juicy. If your fish is sticking to the grate once your timer dings, don\u2019t panic: As long as your steaks are properly oiled, they\u2019ll release easily when they\u2019re ready.I like to finish my fish with a relish-y tomato topping flavored with saffron, almost-crispy garlic, and buttery olives for a superfast and summery dinner that begs to be eaten outdoors. Multi-colored cherry tomatoes from the farmers\u2019 market make for the best presentation, but aren\u2019t strictly necessary; a cold bottle of wine at the ready, on the other hand, is non-negotiable. \u2014Kendra VaculinThis recipe is part of Short Is Sweet, our collection of summer dishes that deliver a whole lot of deliciousness in 30 minutes or less.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I also agree with other reviewers that this would have been better if the tomatoes were cooked, and that the sauce needed something else\u2014this was a pretty, but mediocre, dish.MaryBrooklyn, NY10/7/2021The picture was so wonderful that I expected this to be at least a 4-star recipe.  My daughter said I was brave to serve something to company before testing it first.  I told her so many \"bon appetite\" recipes are so great, that I was not worried.  Well, I ate my words.  This recipe was okay, but that's not what I was going for.  My food was picture perfect, but the taste was lackluster.  I think the recipe called for too much parsley (or maybe I packed mine too tightly).  Also, I think it would have been better if the tomatoes were cooked.  I'm not saving this one in my recipe box.Mary-DeeLaguna Hills, CA7/26/2021Lovely simple preparation. Must like safforn.AnonymousBrooklyn, NY7/13/2021Me encanta esa recetaAnonymousMexico7/7/2021Delicious! Very refreshing and rich at the same time. JohnSag Harbor7/6/2021This recipe was delicious and easy! The market didn't have swordfish, so we had salmon (in the pan not grilled) and it was still incredible with the relish. Will make again! RLD7/6/2021So its pesce spada alla Siciliana minus all the good stuff? \nAdd in pine nuts and raisins to your sauce if you want a truly great recipe.\n\nAlso, cite your sources...JasonPhiladelphia, PA6/28/2021Very tasty and very easy, however, next time I make this I will use half butter and half olive oil to saut\u00e9 the garlic and will add  half of the tomatoes to the butter/oil / garlic mix to cook them a bit for more flavor and to release some of their juices.  Very colorful and flavorful.  I had extra tomato/olive mix left over and ate it over mixed greens the next day.  Will make this again.KathyDenver6/27/2021Fabulous and very easy!  Great dinner party dish. DeniseSugar Land, Texas6/20/2021Delicious! Made a few adjustments: used red snapper instead swordfish and, of course, added butter! I also added some thyme at the end. Lovely and light.
