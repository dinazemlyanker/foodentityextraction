See our past recommendations here!In this CBD-saturated age, combining olive oil and CBD might seem like fodder for the masses constantly craving the next big wellness thing. And there would be no magic in combining a crappy olive oil with inferior CBD. But when one of our favorite olive oil producers teams up with one of our favorite CBD brands, we listen up.Combining beautifully intense olive oil with full-spectrum CBD actually makes a lot of sense. Quality olive oils are high in polyphenols, that peppery bite that grips the back of your throat when you taste them, and CBD\u2019s dynamic aroma comes from terpenes. The grassy, peppery intensity of Wonder Valley\u2019s olive oil meshes perfectly with the pine resin and citrus notes of Lily\u2019s CBD.This isn\u2019t an olive oil to use in your Tuesday night vinaigrette though. It\u2019s intense. The CBD acts like a flavor turbo-charger, exaggerating the olive oil\u2019s sharp, fruity characteristics beyond even the brightest, greenest, most peppery oil. It craves a bit of fruity sweetness, so drizzle it over a bowl of stone fruit with flakey salt, lemony avocado toast, or ice cream. Think of it as the olive oil equivalent of aged balsamic; to be used sparingly and with intention.Buy it: Wonder Valley x Lily CBD Olive Oil, $39 for 100 ml.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
