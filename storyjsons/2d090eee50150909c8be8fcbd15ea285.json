Bartenders relied on them to taste cocktails in a quick and sanitary way before they went out to customers. Patrons needed them to sip drinks without getting a noseful of ice or garnish. And no one ever gave it a second thought.\u201cPlastic straws were essentially another piece of serviceware,\u201d says Ramage. \u201cSo it\u2019s the last thing to go, even in nice restaurants or bars.\u201dRamage estimates Dandelyan churned through \u201cthousands\u201d of plastic straws any given day. The plastic straw epidemic is real, people (Dandelyan has since switched to compostable straws). According to the Plastic Pollution Coalition, over 500 million plastic straws are used each day. In the restaurant and bar industry, they have long been a seemingly necessary evil; they are to bartenders what metal tasting spoons are to chefs.But recently, hospitality giants are clapping back: Danny Meyer just announced Union Square Hospitality Group will start using biodegradable straws, McDonald\u2019s is phasing out plastic straws in the UK and considering the same in the US, and even Alaska Airlines is looking for a compostable version. In New York City, we\u2019ve seen restaurants like La Mercerie and bars like The Dead Rabbit opt for metal straws. Nyesha Arrington, the chef behind Native in Los Angeles, recently tipped us off on farmer Alex Weiser\u2019s straw made of actual straw.Ramage, along with bartender Iain Griffiths, started Trash Tiki, a roving cocktail pop-up that teaches fellow bartenders how to bring sustainability to the bar\u2014and have a little fun with it.\u201cNo one needs another lecture on how modern society is beating the shit out of Mother Nature on a daily basis,\u201d Griffiths and Ramage write on their website. \u201cIt\u2019s not about overhauling your whole program but taking the smaller steps....and hopefully we can get a few of your more serious cocktail jerks to lighten up, have some fun, and listen to some better fucking music for once.\u201dWe need to find a more sustainable presentation for this pi\u00f1a colada.\nPhoto By Alex LauThat begins with getting rid of plastic straws. After their rude awakening at Dandelyan, Ramage and Griffiths got to work, researching and testing out every type of straw alternative. Paper straws disintegrated before the drink was served. Metal straws messed with the mouthfeel. Sugar straws were just \u201cabsolutely horrible,\u201d according to Ramage. Finally, they found their favorite: Panda Packaging, a super clean bamboo straw that doesn\u2019t have the usual grassy aftertaste. (You can find more bamboo straws on Amazon, but Panda Packaging had the least aftertaste, per Ramage and Griffiths.)These are the straws Ramage and Griffiths bring with them on the road for their Trash Tiki pop-ups, but if you can\u2019t track them down in time, make like Ramage and Griffiths when they run out of their supply. Rejigger your drink so it\u2019s with crushed ice, on the rocks, or up; skip the straw; and make it the point of conversation.\u201cWhen we explain to people why the drink doesn\u2019t need a straw, they are usually pretty receptive,\u201d says Ramage. \u201cOnly in a couple instances, people have been like \u2018I need to keep my lipstick on.\u2019\u201dHer response? \u201cBuy better lipstick,\u201d Ramage says, with a chuckle.A summer cocktail you definitely don\u2019t need a straw for:Explore Bon App\u00e9titBarsCocktailSustainableRead MorecultureWhen Will the Tyranny of Paper Straws End?By Alex BeggsrestaurantsMission Chinese Just Reinvented the Tiki Cocktail (Hint: It Changes Colors)By Emily EisenPhotography by Alex LausponsoredLetting the Wine Do the Talking at Napa's Sustainable Frog's Leap WineryBy Edward JonesRecipes you want to make.
