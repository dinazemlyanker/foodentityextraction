What this isolation did ignite, though, was homesickness and a desire to reconnect to the pantry sights and smells of my Caribbean upbringing. The spices from my local grocery store just wouldn\u2019t do. I needed the real McCoy, the truest representation of being \u201cback home.\u201d After sharing this sentiment with my cousin, a surprise delivery made its way to my doorstep: the Caribbean Pantry Essentials subscription box from Callaloo Box.This unboxing was better than any reveal from my favorite influencer. Upon opening, I could smell the aromas of spices like ground roasted geera\u2014commonly known as cumin and the perfect base spice for curries, chili, and slow-cooked beans\u2014and mauby bark, which is used to make a bittersweet iced beverage called mauby, hailed for its medicinal benefits and often found in a large pitcher inside my grandparents\u2019 refrigerator. I could see the uniquely pigmented Chief brand curry powder escaping from the plastic packaging, a familiar sight in the kitchens of grandma and aunts.\u00a0As I happily stocked my pantry, I imagined all the ways I would use these ingredients: the West Indian version of soffritto called green seasoning, great for marinating meat or poultry; Bertie\u2019s pepper sauce (my scrambled eggs\u2019 BFF); refined coconut oil for frying plantains; and coconut milk powder for thickening rice and peas. Swiss macaroni and tomato ketchup were newer items to me, but my cousin assured me both would come in handy for a macaroni pie, the Caribbean\u2019s version of baked mac and cheese. Other items like Shirley tea biscuits and a slew of seasonings for fish, chicken, and cook-up made their way to my cabinet. Now I was ready for some big cooking projects.I queued up soca and reggae on my speakers and prepared shrimp curry and chana dal, an Indo-Caribbean staple in Guyanese households made with split peas, fresh curry leaves, and warming spices like turmeric and cardamom. After finally acquiring the taste for Mauby, I conjured my own rendition, which included a little less cinnamon, a splash more lime juice, and some whiskey. I got back into my cooking ritual\u2014grabbing a large Dutch oven, layering spices, and cooking everything on low heat\u2014and embraced the art of slow-cooking, even in this never-ending pandemic time. With a single inhale of everything going on in my kitchen, I was transported back home.While you can\u2019t buy this particular box, because Callaloo Box\u2019s subscriptions change every month, you can purchase each item on its grocery website. I may not be making my way to islands this year, but my pantry staples tell me otherwise.Photo by Laura MurrayCallaloo Box$40 at Callaloo BoxExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendCaribbean/Central AmericanGroceryShoppingRead MorecultureTweezer Tongs Are the Superior TongsBy Sohla El-WayllycultureOmsom Asian Seasonings Have a Whole Lotta Flavor and a Whole Lotta CredBy MacKenzie Chung FegancultureI\u2019m in Love With This Mustard, Partly Because of Its Name, Mostly Because It\u2019s Just So GoodBy Amiel StanekcultureThis Apple Cider Vinegar Has Changed My Salad Game for GoodBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
