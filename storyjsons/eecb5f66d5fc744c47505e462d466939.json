They don\u2019t have the allure of a cheese-stuffed Juicy Lucy and you\u2019d never organize a grill party around them. They\u2019re not even juicy pork patties.That\u2019s all true, which is why beef and pork exist.But there is one turkey burger in this world that deserves that headliner\u2019s role, and it\u2019s the one with \u201cextra-juicy\u201d in the title.This turkey burger is the antidote to every mean thing anyone ever said about all other turkey burgers. I\u2019ve been collecting those insults for years now, and am prepared to counter them below. Point. By. Point.\u201cTurkey burgers are dry.\u201d \u2014Desir\u00e9e from DesertvilleI know why you\u2019re saying that, Desir\u00e9e. Turkey has less fat than ground chuck. In the context of a burger, fat equals juiciness. Remove the fat, remove the juice, right? Combine that with the fact that poultry has to be cooked well-done, and all of a sudden you\u2019re on the Highway to Dry-way. Usually, yes. In this case: No. There\u2019s half an avocado added to the ground meat, which adds fat, and also interrupts the protein\u2019s ability to bind tightly to itself, which causes cause shrinkage and a loss of juices. Don\u2019t worry about the science, just follow our advice. Amp up the fat, retain the juice.\u201cTurkey burgers have no flavor.\u201d \u2014Barney from BoringtownWhat you mean is that they don\u2019t have the same flavor as beef, and that\u2019s both obvious and true. When cooking a regular, fatty beef burger, we would tell you to season it right before cooking with salt and pepper, which is all a beef burger ever needs. That advice is upended in this recipe, which treats lean, mild ground turkey the way it needs to be treated. Since you\u2019re mashing avocado into the mixture anyway, that\u2019s a great time to season it, too. This patty gets umami and southwestern vibes from the addition of Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, cumin, and fresh onion, a profile heretofore known as Texmami-Mexi.\u201cTurkey burgers are for dieting.\u201d \u2014Joan of NarcOkay, Joan: Let\u2019s say you have no imagination and hate pleasure and simply replace marbled ground beef with ultra-lean ground turkey breast. That decision will reduce calories and fat, and it will also reduce enjoyment of food, thus defeating the purpose of eating. We\u2019re not about that life. This dark meat turkey burger is a celebration of the fine work that fat does, and the joy it brings. There\u2019s avocado in and on this one! There\u2019s mayo in the patty and on the bun! There\u2019s oil in the pan, ensuring a dark brown crusty sear, and there\u2019s fat in the slaw, too. We didn\u2019t put cheese on it, but we\u2019re not going to picket in your driveway if you choose to add it at home (and in that case, may I recommend pepper jack?).\u201cTurkey burgers are stupid.\u201d \u2014Brian BrainiacOh really? Did you see the mountain of slaw and the squishy bun??? Did you know there\u2019s Sriracha mayo on it??? Why would you even say such a thing???? Claire Saffitz developed this recipe and she went to Harvard.NO MORE QUESTIONS.If you have more insults you feel like throwing around, it may be time to ask yourself where this prejudice comes from. Was it that one bad diner experience? That terrible crash diet you did in college? The ex-girlfriend who made you do Meatless Mondays for a year?We understand. And we fixed all that. It\u2019s time to repair, forgive, and move on. If you\u2019re still mad after you eat this burger... Well, you know where to reach me.Get the recipe already:Extra-Juicy Turkey BurgersTurkey burgers always sound like a great idea, but they too often taste like a fat sawdust patty. No more, friends! Mashing avocado into the turkey mixture helps prevent the meat from shrinking and drying out during cooking, which is why these stay awesomely juicy, even when they\u2019re cooked all the way through.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterRecipes you want to make.
