The combination of radish and chile delivers two kinds of heat: The radish gives that peppery, nose-clearing spice while the chile gets your tongue tingling. Crunchy, spicy, and acidic, it\u2019s exactly what you want with steak.\u201d And you\u2019ll also want Worcestershire sauce. \u201cIn El Salvador, Worcestershire sauce\u2014or salsa inglesa as it\u2019s called there\u2014is everywhere,\u201d says Salguero. \u201cIt\u2019s always on the table when you\u2019re eating hanger steak.\u201dIngredients4 ServingsVegetable oil (for grill)Juice of 4 limes\u00bdsmall red onion, thinly sliced2serrano chiles, thinly sliced, seeds removed if desired1garlic clove, finely grated8oz. any kind of radishes, trimmed (peeled if using watermelon radishes), cut into bite-size pieces1cup torn cilantro leaves with tender stemsKosher salt, freshly ground pepper\u00bccup plus 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil11\u00bc-lb. hanger steak, cut crosswise into 2\u20133 pieces, center membrane removedWorcestershire sauce and warmed tortillas (for serving)PreparationStep 1Prepare a grill for medium-high heat; oil grate with vegetable oil.

I didn't know what to expect of the chimol, but it was the perfect compliment to the steak. Served with the Super Refried Beans (in the same issue) and homemade Salvadoran style tortillas (mixed masa with water until a dough formed, formed small balls, patted flat, and cooked on a dry skillet until cooked). crs7Atlanta, GA10/14/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSalvadoranCentral AmericanLatin AmericanSteakBeefMeatEasyWeeknight MealsQuickMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreeGrillingDinnerRecipes you want to make.
