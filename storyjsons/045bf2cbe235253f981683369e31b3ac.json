I enjoy them on a snack plate with cheeses, olives, and crackers; on an open-face sandwich with cheese; or with sliced deli meats. For meals on the go, I also throw them in pasta salads and in a vegetarian salade ni\u00e7oise with feta, boiled eggs, and green beans. \u2014Sahara BohoskeyAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

They are fantastic when combined with roasted veggies and stir in some of the awesome pepper juices. I then roll out shop bought puff pastry. Cook it and then lay the veggies on top with a good sprinkle of grated chedder cheese, pul biber pepper (or freshly ground black pepper) and pop in oven until cheese has melted and lovely and gooey. I always have a jar or two available for last minute meals. Really versatile and super tasty.Nannie StearnCambridge, United Kingdom10/13/2021I roast them on the top of the stove.  Use tongs that will not pierce the skins. Turn them when one side is blistered and black etc etc.  Put them in a plastic bag to steam and cool off enough to handle them, then clean the skins and the seeds. Do not run them under water to speed up the cleaning.....rinse your hands off once in a while.  You want to keep as much of the juices as possible. Cut or tear into pieces and place in bowl of olive oil, the juices and lots of chopped or sliced garlic.  Salt as needed.  Let rest in fridge a while.  Your whole place will smell divine! HeidiNYC9/26/2021I blacken them over a stove burner, put  them in a paper bag, then remove them for easy peeling.Charlotte BurkholzPalm Desert, CA9/26/2021I think microwaving wouldn't give you the same resulting taste as broiling.  I don't broil peppers when I want to blister the skins and peel them but roast them on a baking sheet instead at a high temp (425 - 450 degrees).  Check them about every 8 - 10 minutes and turn them when the top side is blackened.  Continue until they're blackened in spots all over.  When they're blackened all over, put them in a paper bag or in a covered bowl for a few minutes so they steam.  Makes removing the skins very easy.Nancy SDenver, CO9/25/2021I'm intrigued but can you retool the recipe for a microwave? (Broiler sets off smoke alarm in my typically small = average middle class NYC apartment.) AnonymousNYC, NY9/24/2021\nCan these marinated peppers be frozen?\nAnonymousMontreal, Quebec9/24/2021I will definitely be making these. They sound so good!Rebekah945719/24/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titBell PepperVegetableCondiment/SpreadSnackVegetarianVeganDairy-FreeGluten FreeRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
