Now Serving also happens to stock the coolest ceramics (graphic Mt. Washington Pottery bowls, otherworldly Minh Singer dishes), indie food magazines, and actually useful cooking tools (J.B. Prince tweezers!).BUY: all the cookbooks you could ever want, whether it\u2019s a new release from a buzzy chef or an rare, out-of-print classic. Now Serving probably has it.THE VIBE IS: homey. Basket-like lamps loom over tables filled with the most stylish kitchen gear, while a big fig leaf tree flanks tall shelves with indie food magazines and cookbooks you\u2019ll actually want to cook from. When visiting chefs and cookbook authors host cookbook parties or panels at the shop, it feels like one big house party.
