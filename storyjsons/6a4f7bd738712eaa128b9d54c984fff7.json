It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.I have fought about a lot of foods with my boss, Adam Rapoport, including but not limited to bone-in chicken legs, anchovies, and sherry vinegar. But nothing gets him fired up like the mere mention of artichokes.\u201cArtichokes!\u201d he\u2019ll yell. \u201cAmericans hate artichokes, Music. Get that through your skull!\u201dI try again. \u201cThey have thorns,\u201d he\u2019ll yell, \u201cno one wants to deal with thorns when they\u2019re hungry, Music!\u201dI suggest he make the recipe for pasta with artichokes from my book. \u201cMusic,\u201d he\u2019ll yell, \u201cwhat is it with you and artichokes!?! They\u2019re not that good, and they\u2019re not worth the trouble. Deal with it.\u201dWant this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!I don\u2019t agree, which is why I keep getting yelled at. Growing up, we had steamed artichokes for dinner a lot, and no one ever complained about thorns. It\u2019s not that we were danger-averse, it\u2019s just that when you steam them whole, they\u2019re easier to prep than a baked potato. All you have to do is cut off the very bottom of the stem (leaving the stalk intact), then use a serrated knife to cut off the top quarter of the crown, exposing the layers of leaves inside. Then they languish in a steamer basket until a paring knife slips effortlessly into the base, and if you pull off a leaf, the meaty bit at the bottom should be sweet and tender.Sure, Carla's not telling you need to braise artichokes, but you could.\nEva KolenkoWe ate them with a bowl of Hellman\u2019s mayonnaise for dipping, but once in a while we\u2019d switch it up and have melted butter that I liked to season with lots of black pepper. Our recipe ups the ante with garlic, which is even better.Artichokes are unusual and exciting! They\u2019re special, and spring is their season, so you\u2019re going to be seeing them in the grocery store these days. They\u2019re thistles, and yes, they do have thorns, but humans have mustered the courage to eat them for thousands of years. The ancient Greeks ate them\u2014but you\u2019re too busy? I\u2019m not telling you to core them and scoop out the chokes and cut them into tender nubbins and do an elaborate vegetable butchery on them. I\u2019m not telling you to grill them, or fry them, or braise them. Those methods are great, but they\u2019re all a little much, which might be part of why Adam kicked me out of his office all those times. But I do think you\u2019re phoning it in on life, and your dinner, if you can\u2019t muster the energy to steam them and douse them in garlic butter.
