It was sort of a joke, at first. But a few weeks later, I found myself inside Atlanta\u2019s Holeman & Finch Bottle Shop, surrounded by glimmering bottles and feeling, for the first time in months, at peace.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Having lived in sin for a few years before marriage, my partner Dane and I were well-situated on domestic necessities by the time we got engaged: no fancy stand mixer, but enough linens and cookware to cover our bases. So the idea of zapping tea towels with a scanner gun in a Bed Bath & Beyond seemed deeply unnecessary.\nGood booze, however, is a different story.We aren\u2019t party animals by any stretch of the imagination (I prefer a prompt 10 p.m. bedtime) and at home, we aren\u2019t particularly heavy drinkers. But we both like to mix drinks, especially for friends and family. I\u2019m drawn to the prospect of having a well-stocked home bar because I like to offer friends something interesting\u2014something besides vodka and seltzer with a hunk of lime. Making a good drink for a friend gives me as much pleasure as feeding them a good meal. And I like tinkering behind the bar. But when many craft spirits run $30-$60 per bottle, cultivating a well-stocked home bar can become an expensive hobby really fast.Inside H&F Bottle Shop, Atlanta.\nPhoto by Henri Hollis/Courtesy of Holeman & Finch Bottle ShopSo, two or three months before my wedding day, I skipped out of work for a few hours and made my way from Old Tom gin to rhum agricole in the aisles of H&F Bottle Shop. Unlike nearly every other wedding planning-related interaction I\u2019d had, the process was unrehearsed and informal (and, I imagine, more fun than being shuffled around a department store by an overbearing sales associate). Amber, the manager, led me through the spirits side of the shop and provided her guidance when needed, steering me toward the shop\u2019s most interesting bottles, like a gin from Germany\u2019s Black Forest (Monkey 47) and a tequila whose production process involves crushing the agave with a massive, Flintstone-esque stone (Fortaleza).We ended up with a list of 2-3 high-quality examples of each major spirits category: Kentucky bourbons like Jefferson\u2019s and Johnny Drum, gins from Sipsmith and The Botanist, and both spiced rum (Old New Orleans) and rhum (Clement). We also added some curveballs, like Westland\u2019s sherry-aged single malt, a Bigallet aperitif, and electric-yellow Ungava gin.Amber jotted down the picks on a slip of paper they kept on-file at the cash register, and Dane and I included the shop\u2019s information on our wedding website. Our guests could walk in, ask for the list, pick out a bottle to take home, stick a bow on it, and call it a day. No scanner guns, no spreadsheets. The process was so lo-fi, it seems like the kind of thing most boutique bottle shops could pull off, if you ask (or tweet) nicely. And, okay, yes, we did register for some non-booze items we really did want. But choosing to register for silver tequila instead of sterling silverware continues to be one of the best nuptial-related decisions I made.Those gift bottles offered us a means with which to celebrate and toast to our new two-person family, and two years in, the wedding liquor is still flowing freely in our home. In the midst of navigating all the outdated customs that come with planning a wedding, any chance to stray from tradition\u2014like registering for whiskey instead of Waterford\u2014is a revelation. When my friends come over for dinner and we break out the barrel-aged gin they gave us, it\u2019s meaningful and special because we can enjoy it together. The liquor store \u201cregistry\u201d offered a best-of-both-worlds scenario for gift-giving and receiving: a bridge between thoughtful, tangible objects, the ones that remind you of the giver every time you use (or pour) it, and memorable experiences you share with the people you love. Good spirits can be both of these things.Related: 6 Kitchen Tools Your Wedding Registry Doesn\u2019t NeedExplore Bon App\u00e9titWeddingShoppingRead MorecultureOpen Bar or Nah?
