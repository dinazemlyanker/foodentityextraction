But in this new reality, I find myself opening my pantry and considering the option of cookie dough on a Tuesday or a loaf of banana bread when I\u2019m up at 3 a.m., thoughts racing. And though I\u2019ll drop care packages at the doors of the other two apartments in our building and walk some cookies to friends in the neighborhood, my distribution pool has significantly shrank.Which is why, for my own sanity and for fear that I\u2019ll eat a whole tray of brownies in the course of one virtual meeting (yes, that\u2019s me you see snacking in the corner), I\u2019m instituting a new rule for myself: I\u2019m only baking what I can freeze. That includes the stuff that freezes well raw (like biscuits/scones, cookies, and\u2014don\u2019t judge me\u2014choux pastry) or thaws nicely once baked (muffins, unfrosted cakes, brownies).If you\u2019re in the same boat\u2014itching to bake but worried about a spree that\u2019s going to overload your kitchen table with piles of pastries, like that Christmas morning scene in Little Women\u2014 maybe these tips on what freezes well (and how to do it) will help. But if you only learn one thing, it should be this\u2014in general, slice before you freeze so that you can grab a portion or two without having to thaw a big mass.Here\u2019s what I'll be freezing:Cookie doughTo me nothing says self-care quite like baking off one singular cookie (if you don\u2019t want to waste energy, do it while your oven\u2019s still hot from making dinner, or use a toaster oven if you\u2019ve got one).My general rule is that any cookie you can shape (so not macarons or Florentine or anything runny or super delicate like those)\u2014whether it\u2019s in a log or a ball\u2014will freeze well. For scooped cookies (like chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, double chocolate), freeze the balls on a baking sheet\u2014they can be packed shoulder-to-shoulder since you\u2019re not worrying about spreading as they bake. My freezer is tiny (and full), so I usually do this in batches using a quarter sheet tray. Once the balls are frozen solid, transfer to a resealable plastic bag (you can rinse it out and reuse it later) or a freezer-safe container. I bake them straight from frozen, knowing they might take a couple minutes longer in the oven.Slice-and-bake cookies, like these Roasty-Toasty Pecan Caramel Shortbread, will serve you well.\nPhoto by Laura Murray, Food Styling by Susan SpungenFreeze a slice-and-bake cookie (like shortbread) in its log shape. Let it thaw in the refrigerator before slicing, lest it crumble or crack. For cut-out cookies, like sugar cookies or linzers, freeze the dough after you roll it into sheets. Keep the layers separated by parchment, nestle them onto a baking sheet, and wrap the whole set-up in plastic wrap.Shaped biscuits and sconesOnce you\u2019ve shaped them, freeze them on a baking sheet until solid, then transfer to a bag or airtight container. Since these rely on cold butter to rise and puff, they\u2019ll benefit from going straight from the freezer to the oven. Save the final step of brushing with cream or melted butter for when you\u2019re ready to bake.A good idea: a bag of Sour Cream and Onion Biscuits in the freezer.\nPhoto by Laura Murray, Food Styling by Susan Spungen\u00a0Pie doughYou can freeze pie dough once you\u2019ve rolled it out and transferred it to the pie plate, but I prefer to freeze it in a disc, wrapped in plastic wrap and sealed in an airtight bag. That way, I\u2019m not clogging my freezer with a precarious dish or limiting myself\u2014I can use that dough for galettes, hand pies, double-crust pies, etc. I let the brick of dough thaw overnight in the fridge, at which point it\u2019s pliable enough to yield to a rolling pin.I\u2019m planning to make a couple batches of Carla Music\u2019s Flaky Pastry Dough so I can use it for savory dinner galettes. I also keep a pint container of pie scraps (a.k.a. the trimmings) in the freezer\u2014sprinkled with raw sugar and baked straight from frozen in a 425\u00b0F oven, they\u2019re the perfect not-too-sweet-but-very-buttery treat.There's a 0/100 chance that any of my galettes will look this good.\nPhotograph by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, Food Styling by Susie Theodorou, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiMuffins and loaf cakesFreeze these once they\u2019re baked and fully cooled (otherwise, the heat from the wrapped cake will result in condensation and a gummy, wet exterior). I pile cool muffins into a tupperware or freezer bag so that I can grab a couple to temper in the fridge overnight (or at room temperature if I forget to do that).Sometimes I freeze loaf cakes whole, wrapped in a few layers to shield it from freezer burn. It's generally better to freeze \"naked\" loaves\u2014save the glaze/frosting/icing for when you're ready to serve. Most often, though, I\u2019ll slice the cake and freeze the individual pieces so that I can snag just one without having to wait for the whole mass to soften.For sake of neatness and deliciousness, it's better to freeze this carrot loaf unfrosted.\nPhoto by Chelsea Kyle, Food Styling by Pearl JonesBaked brownies and blondiesYou can freeze the whole block, well-wrapped, but\u2014maybe you\u2019re sensing a theme here\u2014I like to slice it first so that it\u2019s easier to grab one or two portions. I\u2019ll happily eat brownies and blondies straight from the freezer (call me crazy), but you can thaw them to your heart\u2019s content. Once thawed, warm it in the oven and top with a scoop of ice cream? Just a thought!I'll take a Camouflage Chocolate Fudge Brownie straight from the freezer, thank you.\u00a0\nPhoto by Laura MurrayBreadMaybe you made focaccia for the first time? Congratulations! I am excited for you. Since it has a short shelf-life at room temperature, I like to store it in a plastic bag (again, wash it out and re-use it) for just a day or two before transferring it to the freezer. Since it has a tendency to dry out, I find it\u2019s best to reheat it in a 300\u00b0 F oven wrapped in foil (or in a covered oven-safe dish) until it\u2019s warmed through. I\u2019ll then uncover it to let it crisp up slightly. Perfect with soup! Or for sandwiches!Focaccia on demand!\nPhoto by Laura Murray, Food Styling by Susan Spungen\u00a0One day, I\u2019ll have friends over again and I\u2019ll break it out of the freezer and we\u2019ll all eat the focaccia with eggplant parmesan for dinner and I\u2019ll make a peach pie for dessert. For now, though, I take small comfort in knowing that my freezer\u2019s fully stocked with brownies and cookie dough, for myself today and for myself and my loved ones in the future.Explore Bon App\u00e9titBasically BakingCoronavirusBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
