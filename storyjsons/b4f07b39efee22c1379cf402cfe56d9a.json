In place of the normal hallmarks of potato salad\u2014mushiness, mayonnaise, unidentifiable add-ins (is that a green bean, I see? a diced carrot chunk?)\u2014this one is all crunchy and salty, with acidic dressing that gets its creaminess from eggs, the eternal crowd favorite. Pour a tall glass of salted watermelon juice and it sounds like pretty balanced meal to me!See, what distinguishes this potato salad from the rest is, first and foremost, the potato preparation. The roly-poly salad consists, mostly, of small new potatoes (so very fashion compared to those old stick-in-the-mud Yukons or Russets, am I right?), which get halved and roasted, no boiling (or, heaven forbid, peeling) necessary. In 20 minutes (25 tops), they\u2019re crispy-edged and golden-brown, like they just spent a little too much time on the beach.The gribiche (hard-boiled egg) dressing on its own. And yes, I would also eat this without potatoes.\nTed CavanaughAnd while the potatoes cook, you have just enough time to putz around your house and still make the potato salad\u2019s pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance: sauce gribiche, an herby, egg-based dressing (stay with me!) that\u2019s often paired with cold meat in French bistros (I\u2019ll pass on that part). Boil a few eggs (make extra for snacks and salads later in the week), chop them up, then fold them into an emulsion of olive oil, white wine vinegar, and grainy mustard, salted-up with itty-bitty cornichons and capers. Spoon any extra sauce over crispy-skinned fish, saut\u00e9ed asparagus and morels, or fat slices of beefsteak tomatoes, or a bed of grains.But give it a try! Shovel some potato salad into a big bowl\u2014more than you think you can eat\u2014and take yourself and your dinner somewhere outside (or somewhere directly in front of an A/C unit). Eat the whole helping, then some more. Get back to me if you\u2019re not totally satisfied and full of life (and potatoes).Get the recipe:New Potatoes with Parmesan, Black Pepper, and Gribiche DressingIf you can\u2019t find new potatoes at the farmers\u2019 market, look for Peewee potatoes or very small Yukon Golds at the grocery store.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPotato SaladPotatoSummerSummer SidesRead Morecooking15 Easy Recipes to Bring to a Picnic or Barbecue or Wherever You Have to Go This SummerBy Alex DelanyRecipes you want to make.
