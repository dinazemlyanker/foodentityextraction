If you sign up for our newsletter, you\u2019ll get her letter before everyone else.Hi everyone,Are there restaurants you keep tabs on even though they\u2019re not in your city? Given the nature of my job, it\u2019s probably not surprising that I do this constantly, obsessing over caf\u00e9s and bakeries, brunch spots, bars, and fine-dining restaurants across the country (and world!). It\u2019s helpful for our work\u2014to give context, to find sources, to tell the best stories possible\u2014but it also means my dining bucket list gets really, really long.\u00a0For years, Juhu Beach Club, chef Preeti Mistry\u2019s bright, street food-style restaurant in Oakland, topped the list. From the other side of the country, I ogled the menu: pavs and sliders, smoky Negronis made with black cardamom, and a whole section of dosa waffles. Preeti also threw an all-out bash every year for the restaurant\u2019s anniversary, which coincided with the Hindu holiday Holi, and I\u2019d always wanted to go to the party. When the restaurant closed in 2018, I thought I\u2019d missed my chance. Which is why I\u2019m so excited that Mistry agreed to develop a menu of fun and snacky Holi recipes for our April issue, out now on newsstands. (Subscribe to get future issues here!)In normal years, chef Preeti Mistry is known to throw a banging Holi party.\nPhoto by Alanna HaleHoli, known as the festival of colors, spring, and love, is about getting together with friends and family and your wider community. Normally, when there isn\u2019t a global pandemic, people gather in the streets, parks, and other outdoor spaces to play the game of colors, smearing vibrant powder or water on each other. It\u2019s an old and evolving tradition, but Juhu\u2019s Holi parties, to me, always felt like the best of what the festival could be. \u201cAs a queer-owned business, we basically co-opted the word love,\u201d Preeti told me when we talked for the story. \u201cLove wins. Love is love. It\u2019s ours. So we get the festival of love.\u201dBelow, you can find the recipes Preeti developed for the story. I didn\u2019t get to do a big blowout for\u00a0Holi this year, but these recipes are ideal for safely celebrating the coming of spring at home.\u00a0 I\u2019m talking about my new favorite Bombay sandwich, complete with jammy onions and a punchy green chutney (seriously, it\u2019s SO good). The roast chicken wings with an extremely cool burnt masala that replicates a smoky tandoor flavor. And the mango lassi I know I\u2019ll be drinking whenever I can get my hands on ripe mangoes (or canned pulp). They\u2019re spring-y and bright, and I hope they bring you joy this season.Let me know if you try any of them, or if you and your family have your own traditions for celebrating spring.
