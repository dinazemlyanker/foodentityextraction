Rules, People!It\u2019s all about cheesy dips and meaty sandwiches.By Adam RapoportJanuary 29, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailLaura MurrayFacebookTwitterEmailEvery Monday night, Bon App\u00e9tit editor in chief Adam Rapoport gives us a peek inside his brain by taking over our newsletter. He shares recipes he\u2019s been cooking, restaurants he\u2019s been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.For those of us in food media, it\u2019s hard to say whether the Super Bowl is our Thanksgiving or if Thanksgiving is our Super Bowl. Either way, I know that at 6:30 p.m. EST this Sunday, I will be sitting down to far more food and drink than any self-respecting dad with a day job and early-morning school run should be indulging in.I also know, after many years, that like any questionably officiated NFL game, there are rules to a Super Bowl party, some of which should even be enforced. Here are mine:Photo by Alex LauDrinksBeer and wine. Period. I am too old to pound cocktails on a Sunday night. (Remember the part about the day job and the school run?) However, I know my guests will expect something other than the cans of Budweiser I rely on, so I will heed the advice of Alex Delany and stock up on the increasingly easy-to-drink craft beer varietals that come in those cool, smartly designed tall boys. And speaking of easy to drink, I\u2019ll also jam my cooler full with some Marissa Ross\u2013approved p\u00e9t-nats, complete with pop-off crown tops.Speaking of coolers. You should absolutely lug your Yeti or Coleman in from the garage, place a beach towel beneath it, load it up with ice and put it to good use.Also, who am I kidding? I do have younger friends, and friends without day jobs. So, about that cocktail. This year, as I yammer on about on Wednesday\u2019s upcoming Super Bowl-themed Bon App\u00e9tit Foodcast, I\u2019m thinking of a DIY paloma bar: a pitcher of freshly squeezed grapefruit juice (it\u2019s citrus season, remember?), a bottle of quality silver tequila, a bucket of ice, crisp seltzer, and lime wedges. Okay, I\u2019ll have one.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Alex LauAppetizersThere will be dips. Lots of dips. We have a bazillion recipes, but I particularly dig our Slow-Roasted Onion Dip, our Creamy Kimchi Dip, and because it\u2019s not the Super Bowl without copious amounts of molten cheese, the world-famous Bob Armstrong Chile con Queso. I\u2019ll slice up a bunch of fennel, some radishes, and whatever else looks good and set those out with some good tortilla chips and potato chips. (While I\u2019m generally an Utz loyalist, I will admit that you need a sturdy chip when dip is in the equation, so I will defer to Cape Cod kettle chips in this instance.)Photo by Alex LauMain courseA) Halftime is dinner time. B) Once the last note of the Star Spangled Banner is sung, I\u2019m done cooking. So, in the interest of getting things done ahead of time...I am all about the Italian hero bar, which I wrote about a few weeks ago. Set out the thinly shaved cold cuts, shredded iceberg (a.k.a. shrettuce), pickled red onions, Calabrian chili spread, oil and vin, dried oregano, mayonnaise (deal with it, all you mayo-haters), and cottony soft hero rolls. And let people have at it. You can get the actual recipe here.On a similar note, I\u2019m also considering getting started a day ahead and making Basically\u2019s Sriracha-Braised Brisket Sandwiches. And then rewarming it and shredding it and setting it out with potato rolls and homemade coleslaw for DIY sandwiches. Hard to argue with.Or, speaking of the podcast, maybe I\u2019ll run back last year\u2019s Hail Mary of an idea, the Bo Ssam-Style Pulled Pork Sandwiches, perhaps the greatest sandwich ever conceived in the halls of BA.Man, quite the playbook we\u2019ve got coming together.Photo by Chelsie Craig, food styling by Anna BillingskogDessertDessert? Seriously? We\u2019re all adults here. Do we really need dessert? And if you\u2019re on the east coast, shouldn\u2019t your kids be home and in bed by the second half?The Important StuffThe over-under, as of today, is set at 56.5 points. I\u2019m betting the under. I think Aaron Donald and Ndamukong Suh are going to get to Brady. And I think Belichick will figure out a way to stymie Goff. So, yeah, bet the under.
