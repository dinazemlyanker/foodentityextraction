There\u2019s really no other word for the intimate, complicated, occasionally combustible relationship that exists between a team of people who pull together night after night (or day after day) to feed a rotating cast of strangers. And so, every day, in restaurants from Toronto to Timbuktu, the ritual is enacted: the feeders become the fed, the caregivers spend a few moments being cared for.Is it any surprise that in New Orleans the ritual just happens to be a little grander? Family meal has been a tradition at Commander\u2019s Palace, the grand old Creole restaurant in the Garden District, at least since its great matriarch Ella Brennan took over in 1974. Long before Commander\u2019s legendary chef Paul Prudhomme convinced sophisticated Orleanian diners to try cochon de lait and other delicacies of his rural Louisiana youth, he was feeding them to his staff as part of meals served before lunch and dinner service. Likewise, those who worked under Prudhomme\u2019s successor, a young unknown from Fall River, Massachusetts, named Emeril Lagasse, got a twice-daily sampling of the food that would soon be defined by the single syllable Bam!\u201cIt\u2019s a way a chef can show what they\u2019re made of,\u201d says Ti Martin, Ella Brennan\u2019s daughter, who now runs Commander\u2019s Palace alongside her cousin Lally Brennan.These days, it\u2019s James Beard Award winner Tory McPhail and his team who preside over the daily meals, held, when weather allows, in the sprawling restaurant\u2019s sun-dappled courtyard. It\u2019s a chance for busboys and managers, line cooks and dishwashers, servers and owners to all sit together fortifying themselves before facing the onslaught of tourists and regulars. The food varies, but on Mondays for lunch, there\u2019s always red beans and rice, and there\u2019s always salad and dessert. On the day we photographed, the menu included grilled barbecue chicken, saffron dirty rice, lamb and plantain casserole, snapper-and-avocado ceviche, coconut flan, and plenty of chicory cold brew. \u201cWe all work our tails off here. Let\u2019s take a second, sit down, and actually have some smart, really good, well-thought-out food,\u201d says McPhail. \u201cHappy cooks make happy food. Happy waiters make happy memories for all of our guests.\u201dBelow, the restaurant staff and the Brennan family tell us what makes the Commander\u2019s Palace tradition more than a shift meal\u2014and find six recipes to make at home.Executive sous-chef Jason Wells (left) and executive chef Tory McPhail (right) preparing family meal.\nPhoto by Daymon GardnerTory McPhail, executive chef: \u201cWe rotate who does family meal. It all comes down to who\u2019s feeling inspired. If I say, \u2018Hey man, it\u2019s Saturday night and I am dying for great Vietnamese food,\u2018 we\u2019ll order some ginger, some lemongrass, whatever we need. We buy ingredients especially for family meal, but we also love utilization. If you buy an 8-oz. piece of redfish to sell a 6-oz. serving, what do you do with the rest? You have to utilize it\u2014in something like family meal ceviche.\u201dStewarding trainer Alvin Young\nPhoto by Daymon GardnerAlvin \u201cBig Al\u201d Young, stewarding trainer: \u201cThe best is fried chicken, because I\u2019m doing that one. Oh man, my fried chicken is amazing. They love it when I fry the chicken. I season it, soak it in buttermilk, put it in the walk-in for an hour or two, then take it out, flour it, and put it back in the cooler. So, it\u2019s a double batter. Extra crispy. [At Family Meal,] everybody greets everybody. Everybody talks to everybody. Some people are having bad days, some people are having good days. Me personally, I try to have a good day every day.\u201dPastry chef Caroline Cousins (left); evening line cook Lloyd McKissick (right)\nPhoto by Daymon GardnerProduction cook Kristian Madere (left); butcher Bryan Guillerman (right)\nPhoto by Daymon GardnerDottie Brennan\nPhoto by Daymon GardnerDottie Brennan: \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing family meal for as long as I can remember, going back to first Brennan\u2019s, on Bourbon Street. Ella and I live right next door, so we eat family meal all the time. We\u2019re the ones who enforce the rules: Make it look good and taste good. I\u2019m not afraid to tell them if I don\u2019t like it. They probably think I\u2019m a pill. Or a bitch. Both of us love hot dog night. I like mine with chili, cheese, onions, and a little sweet pickle. Ella likes hers with [leans in, whispers] ketchup.\u201dLally Brennan\nPhoto by Daymon GardnerLally Brennan, co-proprietor: \u201cThe only disaster is if Dottie and Ella go through family meal and they don\u2019t like it. That\u2019s a disaster. \u2018Cause you will hear about it. Taco Night is my favorite. Or when they have fries. I always need to have some fries.\u201dChef McPhail and staff on the Commander\u2019s Palace patio, where they often eat family meal.\nPhoto by Daymon GardnerAmy Mehrtens, sous-chef: \u201cIf you have a particular craving or a homestyle thing you want to make, you raise your hand: \u2018I\u2019ve got family meal\u2019 today.\u2019 I\u2019ve done chicken adobo\u2014a Filipino chicken dish with rice and fried garlic. Recently I did yaka mein, which is a local noodle soup down here. We did chicken pot pie the other day. It\u2019s just sort of what we\u2019re in the mood for. We plan for about 100 people per shift, especially on a busy Friday night. You always have to have a protein, a vegetable, a salad, and dessert.\u201dManager Kenny Meyer\nPhoto by Daymon GardnerKenny Meyer, manager since 1997: \u201cSometimes you can see new people being trepidatious about the whole thing. They don\u2019t know where to sit or who to sit with. I always try to pull up a chair with them. To put them at ease. It\u2019s sitting down and breaking bread, the same way you\u2019d do with family. There\u2019s something to be said for that. One of my favorites, honestly, is when we do cold cuts. Who doesn\u2019t like a good ham sandwich?\u201dPhoto by Daymon GardnerTi Martin, co-proprietor: \u201cIn the old days, on the financial statement, it would be called cook\u2019s pot. I\u2019m a total foodie and eat very interesting food, but when I want something for family meal, I just want a ham sandwich. My mom eats bologna. Sometimes employees who aren\u2019t scheduled to work will show up for a meal. Or work men. You\u2019ll be like, \u2018Who\u2019s that?\u2019 It\u2019s the plumber or someone working on the air conditioner. The wine people tend to make their deliveries right around family meal.\u201dAnd now, we feast:1 / 6ChevronChevronCold-Brew Chicory CoffeeView RecipeLearn about another New Orleans legend:Explore Bon App\u00e9titNew OrleansRestaurants + TravelRecipes you want to make.
