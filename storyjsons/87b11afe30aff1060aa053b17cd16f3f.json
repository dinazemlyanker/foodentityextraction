Kerrygold? Finlandia?) or flour (King Arthur? Gold Medal? Bob\u2019s Red Mill?). But there is only one cream cheese, and that is the brick-shaped silver package with the bright blue lettering: Philadelphia.\u201cI only believe in Philly cream cheese,\u201d wrote BA\u2019s Claire Saffitz immediately after I\u2019d emailed her. \u201cIt\u2019s just the best, and nothing else tastes right.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything else like it,\u201d says Priscilla Scaff-Mariani, the executive pastry sous chef at Gabriel Kreuther in New York, about its flavor and texture. \u201cEven when I was in culinary school, it was like, \u2018Oh, we need cream cheese?\u2019 It\u2019s Philadelphia. It wasn\u2019t even a second thought.\u201dPhiladelphia cream cheese\u2019s dominance isn\u2019t a happy accident. Its cult popularity is likely the result of equal parts clever marketing and good timing.The brand dates back to the late 1800s, when Pennsylvania dairies became known for their soft, creamy cheese made with whole milk. New York dairies, on the other hand, were making a version with skim milk that was much chalkier. One scheming New Yorker named William Lawrence started selling his own cream cheese (it was actually made of skim milk, with some lard mixed in for richness) under the label \u201cPhiladelphia,\u201d hoping the Pennsylvania association would attract customers. He even trademarked the words \u201cPhiladelphia\u201d and \u201cPennsylvania\u201d in conjunction with cheese products. It worked\u2014and sold. When the company merged with Kraft Foods in 1928 and developed a pasteurized version of the product, Philadelphia cream cheese became a household name.Philadelphia cream cheese was both the first product of its kind\u2014a shelf-stable, rich, tangy, spreadable soft cheese\u2014and \u201cone of the first branded food products in America,\u201d says Stella Parks, author of the nostalgic baking book, BraveTart. \u201cPhiladelphia has been in the cream cheese game for so long that it became synonymous with cream cheese.\u201dThe second stroke of genius on Philadelphia\u2019s part was marketing to home bakers. During the 1900s, recipes were beginning to be distributed through magazines, newspapers, and advertisements. In 1937, Philadelphia was publishing ads that included a recipe for \"Philadelphia cake,\" a vanilla-flavored confection that called for five and a half packages of Philadelphia cream cheese in the batter. Women\u2019s magazines framed Philadelphia cream cheese as a fancy ingredient for entertaining. In an April 1909 article in the Perry Daily Chief, cookbook author Emma Telford extols the benefits of using cream cheese in cheesecake: \u201cAs formerly made, there was a tedious separation of curds and whey, but the housewife of today eliminates that by taking a Neufch\u00e2tel or cream cheese as the foundation.\u201d Countless cookbooks that followed called for bricks of Philadelphia cream cheese in baking but also for savory dips, spreads, and stuffings.\u201cPeople liked the recognizable brand names,\u201d Parks says. \u201cThey felt good about it regardless of quality.\u201d Philadelphia became the most trusted cream cheese, even as others entered the market. According to a spokeswoman for the company, it currently occupies 68 percent market share in the U.S. alone.But its continued popularity isn\u2019t due to the nostalgia factor alone. Thanks to a good amount of stabilizers and an almost alarmingly silky texture, Philadelphia cream cheese just works really well in desserts.Alex Raij, chef at New York Spanish restaurants La Vara, El Quinto Pino, Txikito and Saint Julivert Fisherie, loves the cream cheese\u2019s \u201cplasticity,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can mold it in your fingers. It has that particular body that makes it easy to cream ingredients with. It naturally emulsifies.\u201d She even uses it in ice cream\u2014a move she learned from Jeni Britton Bauer of Jeni\u2019s Ice Cream\u2014to create an eggless base that isn\u2019t vulnerable to icicles.Philly cream cheese is what makes the frosting on Basically\u2019s sheet cake easy to swoosh into pretty waves.\nSaffitz says she can\u2019t count how many times she has whipped Philadelphia cream cheese into birthday cake frosting or baked it into a cheesecake. \u201cI love how it whips up so creamy and smooth,\u201d she says, \u201cbut also adds such wonderful heft and density. The flavor is tangy and balanced.\u201dScaff-Mariani points to the high silkiness and low moisture content of Philadelphia relative to other brands. \u201cIt mimics the consistency of butter in a lot of ways,\u201d she says. In addition to using it for cheesecakes, she has also tried it in macaron fillings and in cookies. She\u2019s heard of bakers using it to make puff pastry.There\u2019s also the consistency factor. Jessica Craig, pastry chef at L\u2019Artusi in New York, says she uses Philadelphia more than any other brand because it is \u201cthe same texture every single time,\u201d which is important in a fast-paced, high-volume kitchen environment. She works in an Italian restaurant, but when customers order cheesecake, she doesn\u2019t turn to ricotta or mascarpone\u2014she uses Philadelphia.American bakers aren\u2019t the only lovers of soft, spreadable cheese. Philadelphia has cultivated the same brand loyalty across the world, primarily in countries that love cheesecake as much as us. (A Philadelphia spokeswoman declined to share the top countries for cream cheese sales.)Norie Uematsu, executive pastry chef at Cha-An Tea House in New York, grew up in Japan, where Philadelphia cream cheese is well-known and used to make Japanese souffl\u00e9 cheesecake, which is much airier than a traditional iteration, as well as a rare cheesecake, a no-bake dessert consisting of cream cheese, sugar, heavy cream, and gelatin.Two pounds of cream cheese go into this Basque-style cheesecake. Two. Pounds.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensRaij described a \u201cBasque love affair with Philadelphia cream cheese,\u201d pointing to the custardy black-topped burnt Basque cheesecake. Spaniards also put it in savory dishes, like cream-cheese-stuffed Piquillo peppers. In Spain it\u2019s often spelled like \u201cFiladelfia,\u201d and pronounced \u201cPea-la-del-pia,\u201d Raij says.And yet, despite its fame, Philadelphia\u2019s primacy hasn\u2019t gone completely unchallenged either.Noah Bernamoff, who runs Black Seed Bagels in New York, swears by Ben\u2019s, a brand of cream cheese popular in New York, because it \u201chas the actual flavor of fresh cheese\u201d and produces fluffier cheesecakes without a long list of mystery ingredients. \u201cPhiladelphia is really just a texture,\u201d with no flavor, he says.Parks shares that skepticism. She tests her recipes with Philadelphia because she knows that\u2019s what most people use. But aside from her cream cheese frosting recipe (where Philadelphia\u2019s thickeners and stabilizers prevent the cream cheese from turning into soup), she has tried each of her desserts with other brands of cream cheese and did not find a major difference in quality.\u201cOn a personal level I can\u2019t say that I have some deep affection for Philadelphia,\u201d Parks says. Using it is \u201cjust a way to lock down variables.\u201d Other than that, she doesn\u2019t really understand bakers\u2019 deep affection for it. \u201cPeople stick with what they know.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titCream CheeseGroceryRead Morerecipes27 Cream Cheese Recipes To Use What's in the Back of Your FridgeGallery27 SlidesBy Bon App\u00e9titcookingWhat is Vanilla (And Why Is It Sooo Expensive)?By Sarah JampelEasy Sheet Cake with Chocolate-Cream Cheese FrostingRecipes you want to make.
