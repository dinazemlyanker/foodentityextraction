When something\u2019s so easy to make that you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.\u201cPeople ask me, How do I replicate the depth of flavor of really good Indian food at home?\u201d says chef and restaurateur Meherwan Irani, whose growing empire includes six restaurant locations and a spice company across Atlanta, Asheville, and Charlotte. \u201cAnd the number one thing I tell them is to make a ginger-garlic paste and fry it in oil until you get this beautiful caramelization.\u201dGinger and garlic are found together so often in South Asian dishes that many cooks keep a jar of homemade ginger-garlic paste in their fridge, both to save themselves the step of peeling and mashing ginger and garlic every time they go to cook and to incorporate flavor more smoothly and evenly. \u201cIf I cook just with ginger, I always end up with little fibrous bits of ginger in the food, and you have to be really careful with how you use [chopped or sliced] garlic since it burns so quickly,\u201d Irani says. \u201cThis paste is the perfect marriage of both. It has its own taste and smell, but it\u2019s just ginger and garlic.\u201dThe formula is as simple as it comes: equal parts peeled ginger and peeled garlic, blitzed together in a food processor with a preserving element. Irani\u2019s recipe is more of a mandate than a list of instructions: Don\u2019t overthink it. \u201cIf someone asks, \u2018How much?\u2019,\u201d he says, eyeballing it in one of his Instagram Lives, \u201cI\u2019d probably say a cup and a half of ginger, a cup and a half of garlic, and a half cup of liquid\u2014a quarter cup of white vinegar and a quarter cup of water.\u201d On the phone, he tells me that folks could instead add a little oil and a tiny bit of lime juice, just enough to get the food processor going; in my own apartment, I also add a little salt, which Irani doesn\u2019t necessarily recommend himself: \u201cI want control of my seasoning as I\u2019m cooking, and that would be just one more variable that [already] has salt in it.\u201dBefore the pandemic, I rarely made it in large quantities because I feared I wouldn\u2019t go through it in enough time\u2014I just wasn\u2019t cooking all that much at home. But these days, I make it by the jar, using it as a base to build flavor. Most often, I\u2019ll throw it into a pan with some oil and spices, maybe a chopped onion, then adding vegetables and whatever else.Ginger-garlic paste, Irani says, is also an incredible marinade. Some Indian dishes like tandoori chicken call for it as the first of two: \u201cThe first marinade is usually ginger-garlic paste and/or lime juice, turmeric, and chili powder. And then you come in and do your second marinade, which is your tandoori marinade. That ginger-garlic paste in that first marinade adds such a beautiful foundational layer.\u201dIt also works as a batter. At his restaurant Chai Pani, Irani makes a crispy masala fish roll that has a crunchy, golden exterior without any breadcrumbs, panko, or cornstarch\u2014there\u2019s only ginger-garlic paste, plus some spices, oil, and lime juice. \u201cThe ginger-garlic paste fries around the fish and forms something almost like a batter, which gives this wonderful crispy, crunchy texture.\u201dSo when is it best to play with ginger-garlic paste? If a dish just calls for garlic and it makes sense for it to have the background flavor of ginger, use it. But, as Irani is quick to warn, it\u2019s not a substitute. \u201cIt\u2019s not a garlic-plus,\u201d he says. \u201cBut anywhere where you think that a touch of garlic or a touch of ginger wouldn\u2019t hurt use ginger-garlic paste.\u201d He recommends adding a tablespoon to marinara sauce after the onions are saut\u00e9ed, or a teaspoon anytime you\u2019re doing a classic mirepoix. \u201cSlow-braising something? Rub that piece of meat down with some ginger-garlic paste first and then proceed with whatever else you were doing. It helps transform tough cuts by tenderizing the meat even more.\u201dWhen you\u2019ve hauled down the food processor, you might as well make a big batch: A jar keeps in the fridge for a few weeks and it freezes well in ice cube trays or frozen tablespoon-size scoops for a couple of months, and it works into practically everything.Try Priya Krishna\u2019s Garlic-Ginger Chicken With Cilantro and Mint.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, food styling by Kat BoytsovaIf you\u2019ve never used it before, Irani recommends starting here: To \u00bc cup paste, add \u00bc tsp. chili powder and/or turmeric and some salt and rub down a chicken, then roast or stir-fry it, depending on whether you have a whole chicken or something like 4 chicken breasts. Or take some frozen shrimp, defrost them, and make a batter using ginger-garlic paste, oil, lime juice, salt, pepper, chili powder, and ground turmeric. Dredge the shrimp in the batter and pan-fry them to make a little popcorn shrimp appetizer.\u201cAre there any two more perfect ingredients that are not spices that add flavor to food?\u201d Irani muses to me. \u201cThese are building blocks of flavor all over the world. By themselves, they\u2019re both remarkable things to work with. But pur\u00e9e them together and this alchemy happens.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimpleRecipes you want to make.
