I Was Wrong.As the reality set in that I was sharing my body, I began to fret over my nutrition in a way I never had before.By Meryl RothsteinJanuary 14, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by B\u00e1rbara MalagoliFacebookTwitterEmailI pictured myself in the kitchen, skin glowing, baking a cake for no reason other than that I wanted to eat a cake. I figured I\u2019d have ice cream by the pintful. When the waiter asked if I wanted dessert, I was going to say yes every damn time. I imagined my pregnancy as nine months of socially sanctioned overeating, the one time in a woman\u2019s life when no one judges her for ordering grilled cheese and fries and a milkshake by herself at the diner.This is gonna be fun, I thought.It wasn\u2019t.First, there were the dietary restrictions, the fine print on my new indulgence contract. Depending on who you ask, pregnant women are supposed to avoid alcohol, unpasteurized soft cheese, raw fish, raw meat, rare meat, raw eggs, runny eggs, deli meats, tuna, swordfish, tilefish, King mackerel, lox, sprouts, too much caffeine, unpasteurized milk, and unwashed produce. My doctor\u2019s list differed slightly from my friends\u2019 doctors\u2019 lists, which differed slightly from lists I found online. How was I supposed to know which list was the right list, the one standing between me and preventable miscarriage or birth defects? And what technically counts as a deli meat anyway? Meals, particularly meals out, suddenly felt like culinary minefields. There\u2019s nothing joyful about standing at a holiday party googling, \u201ccan pregnant women eat p\u00e2t\u00e9?\"I decided to take a laid-back approach. I knew so many women who enjoyed a nightly glass of wine! I read modern-day pregnancy bible Expecting Better, which uses science to persuasively argue that many of the restrictions are unfounded! But then I remembered something: I\u2019m not laid back. On a vacation to Italy, I ate prosciutto\u2014when in Rome, literally\u2014then spent the next two hours wondering what it said about me as a mother that I decided the joys of Italian cured meats outweighed the elevated risk of fetal listeria.So I did my best to follow the rules, but found that had a downside of its own: I felt uptight and uncool among women whose doctors gave them the green light on sushi or who downed espressos throughout their pregnancies. Avoiding unpasteurized cheese in some people\u2019s company makes you feel like the one kid at the middle school party who refused to take a drag of that cigarette.For all the talk of \u201ceating for two,\u201d it\u2019s not actually a thing. Yes, you\u2019re supposed to eat more calories, but only a few hundred per day\u2014think a bowl of ice cream, not the pint. And those calories are supposed to come from foods like almonds and avocados, not, you know, Cheetos. Plus, during my first trimester, I barely wanted to eat, period\u2014I didn\u2019t experience food cravings so much as food aversions. Instead of looking forward to meals (my typical motivation for getting out of bed each morning is the opportunity to eat breakfast), they became obligations.As the reality set in that I was sharing my body, and everything I put in it, with my baby, I began to fret over my nutrition in a way I never had before. Eventually I\u2019d have lots of people to help me raise my baby\u2014my husband, for example, would presumably pitch in\u2014but for now, I was on my own. Only I could promote cognitive development with omega-3s or bone formation with calcium. It was an immense responsibility.Meal planning, once a source of pleasure (what do I want to eat this week?!), now felt loaded. I made sure seafood was on the menu at least three times a week in search of those vaunted omega-3s. I snuck spinach into larbs and ate salads like it was my job\u2014which I kind of felt like it was.I was hungry pretty much all the time, so I began packing healthy snacks with a fervor. I brought containers of carrot sticks and broccoli to work no matter how many times my boss made fun of me for eating the after-school snack of a fourth grader. I was like that guy who pats down his coat every morning to make sure he has his keys and wallet, except I was checking for an apple and a hard-boiled egg.I loved these healthy habits, but I hated having to think about food so much.Then came my gestational diabetes test.An estimated two to ten percent of women get gestational diabetes\u2014basically, diabetes for the duration of your pregnancy. I was diagnosed with gestational glucose intolerance, which is not nearly as serious as diabetes, but it meant my body wasn\u2019t processing glucose as well as it should. My doctor encouraged moderation in carbs but told me not to beat myself up over my food choices.At first, I used a simple system: If something was truly delicious, I\u2019d give myself the green light to go for it and not feel stress if it was high in carbs. My doctor encouraged moderation, not abstinence. But if I was eating it just because it was there and I was kind of hungry, I wanted to learn how to pass on that, something I imagine everyone with more self-discipline than me already does. This system worked for me for maybe a week, until I realized that I was setting myself up to agonize over every carb that passed in front of me. And when you work at a place like Bon App\u00e9tit, where people casually swing by your office to ask if you want some croquembouche, that was a lot of agonizing.So I switched to cheat days, no matter how much that idea\u2014and that phrase!\u2014made me cringe. I\u2019d give myself permission to eat sweets a few days a week, which I\u2019d typically plan for when I knew there\u2019d be something good\u2014a tasting in the test kitchen for a cake story, say, or a vacation to Austin. This drastically cut down on the number of 4 p.m. squares of chocolates, or the times I\u2019d wander over to the office snack table \u201cjust to look.\u201dI got into a routine. I was eating more healthfully than I probably ever had in my life. I felt like I had finally cracked the code on my sweet tooth, that the world had given me permission to eat junk and I had decided I was into carrot sticks. I was sure that I\u2019d keep these habits after my pregnancy.Of course that didn\u2019t happen either. In the first weeks after I gave birth, I was ravenous (a consequence of breastfeeding, which burns calories like crazy), and I didn\u2019t have the energy to think about what I was eating. I roamed around my kitchen shoving\u2014literally shoving\u2014into my mouth anything I could eat with one hand while bouncing a newborn with the other. If I overthought food when I was pregnant, this moment was its opposite. And with it came the realization that, thanks to the caloric churn of breastfeeding, I could eat whatever I wanted and lose weight.This was my Ben & Jerry\u2019s fantasy. Finally.Months later, I\u2019m still breastfeeding, though I\u2019m no longer shoving Mallomars into my face (for the most part). I\u2019ve gained back time in the kitchen and the wherewithal to peel carrots, and my diet is more closely approaching normal. One major difference between my life before pregnancy and now\u2014aside, of course, from having a wonderful baby\u2014is that I eat dessert with abandon. And, probably for the first time in my adult life, I don\u2019t feel bad about it. After months of thinking so hard about what I was eating, it feels nice not to worry. I am eating for one once again, and at this moment, I feel like I\u2019m doing right by her.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyHealthyishCooking For KidsessayRead MoreLifestyleFor Santigold, Climbing Kilimanjaro Was Easier Than Having KidsBy Caitlin BrodyRecipes you want to make.
