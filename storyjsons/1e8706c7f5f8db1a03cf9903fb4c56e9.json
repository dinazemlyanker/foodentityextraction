Here frozen spinach simmered in cream becomes a plush canvas for spiced chickpeas, fried shallots, and, for added punch, pickled peppers. \u2014Shilpa Uskokovic, food editorAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

That said, this recipe helped me finish up a lot of mostly empty jars. A little lemon at the end was the citrus icing on this unlikely combo, which is being added to the rotation.MarciaChicago area2/21/2022This is SO so good - ideal weeknight meal. Don't question the recipe at all and get the NY Shuk they recommend. This just became a new staple. Alex GAtlanta, Georgia2/10/2022Delicious! Substituted heavy cream with coconut cream with great results (did not taste coconutty). I do think all ingredients are necessary, really good, will make again. SvetlanaScottsdale, AZ2/3/2022Loved it\u2014the spicy/pickled/creamy combo is absolutely great. Didn't have any fried shallots unfortunately\u2014turns out Lunar New Year is not the day to hit up an Asian market as all the ones in Chinatown were closed! (Duh.) But even without them, we highly enjoyed\u2014spouse said it needs to go in the regular rotation. Ate it with TJ's naan on the side.RitaOakland, CA2/2/2022As many reviewers indicated, I thought this an odd combination of ingredients.  But, also, as many reviewers indicated, this recipe produced an amazingly tasty dish and one  that is so easy to put together.  I did make my own fried shallots (in evoo heated to about 250 F for about 4 minutes and then drained on paper towel).  The harissa is the key to this dish so make or purchase one with the heat to your liking.  I served this to my husband, daughter, and her husband by layering the spinach, then the chickpeas, the giardiniera,  the peppers and fried shallots on the warmed bread.   They all loved it so this one is a keeper.P Casey Silver Spring MD1/30/2022This was delicious! So many flavors and textures. Complex, but so easy to throw together. Chickpeas took a tad longer to cook on my stove for the sauce to get clingy and thicken. I also fried my own shallots - 2 large shallots thinly sliced in about 2 tbsp of veggie oil for about 5-7 minutes on med/hi until they were browned and crispy. Worth the minor additional effort. AnonymousSan Francisco 1/27/2022I don't know how someone came up with this blend of ingredients but it's genius! Delicious, comforting, nourishing, and easy, simple fast! I ordered the recommended harissa, and it is worth buying for sure. This is a keeper of a recipe, and perfect for a vegetarian, but I'm an omnivore who loves my veggies, and this is really terrific.SusanNew Jersey1/24/2022I heard about this recipe on the BA podcast about favorite COVID ingredients. (In this case, frozen spinach). Do not be turned off by the seemingly strange ingredient list! This hits every savory note: creamy, spicy, crunchy, salty. I would have never thought of putting these pantry items together but it comes together quickly and is out of this world. Will make again and again! Strange Sounding Ingredients - Absolutely Delicious ResultSan Francisco1/24/202210/10 would make agin. I forgot harissa - like a MORON - so I used sundried tomato pesto kicked up with some chili flakes, as it was what I had. It was fabbbb and even my \u201cwhere\u2019s the meat\u201d husband loved it. Plotting how I can make this again ASAP. AnonymousCanada 1/24/2022This was really pleasantly surprising and had a great effort to reward ratio. Big pinches of salt really are the key here; the components are really easy to under season. You could make this vegan with coconut milk. Next time, I'll double the garbanzo bean mixture. That stuff is addictive. NytashaOakland1/19/2022Is this one of the top 10 recipes on BA, or is that just the cream talking?KonstantinDurham, NC1/16/2022This recipe was great! It took 15 min from start to finish and the only chopping required was the shallots. I also used sliced banana peppers instead of giardiniera and pickled cherry peppers. 1/3 cup of harissa was too spicy for me (low tolerance) so I\u2019ll probably cut back next time. But excited to make this again!Lisa CSan Francisco, CA1/13/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titDinnerMainEasyWeeknightVegetarianNut-FreeHealthyishHarissaCondiments, Sauces & PastesSpinachLeafy GreensVegetableChickpeaBeanRecipes you want to make.
