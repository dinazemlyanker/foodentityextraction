I want beauty! I want marble! I want\u2026a lazy Susan?By Alex BeggsNovember 20, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Laura MurrayFacebookTwitterEmailHAPPY HOLIDAY$$$$$$$. If you came here for a sweet little ditty about the \u201ctrue spirit\u201d of the holidays, you might be in the wrong department. Unless that true spirit is SPENDING! Jingle jingle jingle! Ho ho hoooo! (That\u2019s me ringing a set of reindeer bells and cackling wildly in the aisles of Target.)Ladies and gents, we\u2019re here to celebrate the best part of the holiday season (other than the cheese balls): OPENING PRESENTS. Receiving presents. Thinking about what presents others have yet to bestow upon me. Exchanging mediocre presents for what I really wanted. But before I get to that last part, you could just buy me exactly what I desire from the get-go\u2014these 12 unnecessary-but-beautiful-and-often-useful kitchen items. Stuff I want! Stuff I might need at some point! And I can\u2019t be the only one.Do you need any of these items to successfully make a Basically recipe? No. But will you be glad to have them? Will you show them off to your friends, family, and pets? Will you sleep with them by your side? Yes, yes, and yes.Find the rest of our 2019 gift guides right here.All products featured on Basically are independently selected by our editors.

Once a year I make cherry clafoutis. And a few times a year I need to pit Castelvetranos. That rough math comes out to: JUST GET ME A PITTER.Buy it: $12 from TargetA Moody Mortar and PestleI wanna smash some stuff. A mortar and pestle has utility, yes\u2014it brings out your spices\u2019 freshest, boldest flavors. But it\u2019s also great for crushing nuts (for this omgawwwd romesco sauce) and cramming garlic into a paste. Let\u2019s now focus on where it really functions, and that\u2019s lookin\u2019 pretty on open shelves. This big black marble one portrays a cook who is serious and glamorous. Me me me! I could also smash any home intruders over the head with it. Now that\u2019s useful!Buy it: $150 from Food52A DonabeSpeaking of things that look pretty on open shelves, I don\u2019t need a donabe! But I WANT one. Oh yes. Handmade earthenware. Even heat and insulation and \u201cfar-infrared ray-distribution.\u201d Think of all the healthy soups and steamed black bass fillets I\u2019ll whip up in this when I have the upper arm strength to get it down from the shelf.Buy it: $180 from JinenPhoto by Chelsie Craig\u00a0A Tiny Tomato KnifeI have a big serrated knife, but life is too short for such long knives. I need a small guy to cut tomatoes from the months of July through October and grapes from January through December. You don\u2019t cut grapes year-round? You do now!Buy it: $9 on AmazonAn Expensive ApronThere comes a time in every cook\u2019s life when she knows that her smash burgers will be crispier, her pasta glossier, and her potato slices thinner\u2014if only she had the right apron for the job. The kind of apron that will manifest into better cooking. If you look the part, you\u2019ll become the part. Years of experience? Who has the time? This deep denim-looking apron from Freitag is sturdy yet lightweight and already broken-in (it\u2019s linen and hemp, something eco-friendly called F-ABRIC that can go weeks without washing). It hides oil and food stains. It has pockets. It has cool and adjustable stripe-y straps. It\u2019s $150?!?!! It\u2019s COMPOSTABLE. Worth every penny, of someone else\u2019s pennies.Buy it: $150 from FreitagA Set of Frenchy Steak KnivesLaguiole is a style of knives made in the village of, you guessed it, Laguiole in central France. It\u2019s largely ripped off at tourist shops in New Orleans and on the internet at large because it has no trademark. So this set, in olive wood with an unnecessary holder with a prominent metal seal sold by trustworthy Williams Sonoma, is how you say, l\u2019\u00e9git. But the absolute pleasure of a Laguiole knife is the tiny bumblebee on the handle. That\u2019s what we\u2019re here for.Buy it: $100 for 6 from Williams SonomaA Rectangular\u2014I Said Rectangular!\u2014Tart PanIf I had my very own tart pan, I might bake three to five tarts annually. That\u2019s 65 tarts a decade, adjusted for inflation! But it\u2019s gotta be rectangular. Long-legged rhubarb was born for this moment. Every tart made in a rectangular pan is like buying a work of art already custom-framed. Pleaseeeee!Buy it: $18 from Williams SonomaA Pretty Green CasseroleLike the donabe, whatever you cook in a pretty casserole can go straight from oven-to-table. As a person who could tone it down a notch, I dig the calming minty green of this one made by BergHOFF. Sure, I have an oil-splattered Lodge Dutch oven (thanks, Santa!) that serves the same functional purpose. But the Lodge, at this point, looks like it\u2019s survived a ride on the back of Mad Max\u2019s Interceptor. It\u2019s been through some shit. The BergHOFF is like changing out of your overalls into your church clothes. Nice.Buy it: $180 from Food52A Speckly Spoon RestOh, you think I could just wipe the counter after? Are you crazy????Buy it: $28 from SchoolhouseA Lazy MF-ing SUSANFood on the table is meant for sharing, but I can\u2019t stop everything I\u2019m doing to keep passing the salt and chile crisp. But if there\u2019s going to be a slab of spinning wood on the center of the table, it needs to look as good as a vase of flowers. This one from Terrain is mango wood (?!) and brass with a scrolling subtle leaf pattern.Buy it: $100 from TerrainA Salt, I Mean \u201cSel,\u201d JarPut this salt cellar on the lazy Susan, call it a day. It\u2019s glass and has a nice riveted pattern and a wooden lid that nestles in. Classy. I like the \u201cSEL\u201d label because my guests will think, \u201cOh, she must speak French,\u201d increasing my worth in their judgmental, Francophile minds. Fooled \u2018em!Buy it: $18 from Magnolia MarketTrivets That Looks Like Cute-Ass LeavesJUST LOOK AT THEM.Buy it: $64 from GarmentoryExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingGift GuidesHoliday GiftsHoliday 2019Recipes you want to make.
