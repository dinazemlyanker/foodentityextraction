Thankfully, a friend recommended a guy named Tim Beard, no joke, for the former. The wine proved more difficult. And then I heard about Sam Rozani and the gas station he manages called Sunrise Mini Mart (a.k.a. Sunrise Bottle Shop).Sunrise sells all the things you expect from a normal gas station\u2014chips, smokes, and that new flavor of Gatorade. But it also has one of the craziest, most impressive, and most unexpected natural wine selections you\u2019ll come across. Sunrise Sam, as his fans call him, first fell in love with craft beers (you\u2019ll find offerings from pretty much every outstanding Austin craft brewer, as well as those further afield), which eventually led to his infatuation with low intervention wines. These days you\u2019ll still find a few people filling up their cars with gas, but the rest of us are filling our trunks with cases of hard to find bottles. Wine from Mexico? Yep. Sam stocks as much Bichi as he can get his hands on. Sake? Yamada Shoten\u2019s Everlasting Roots tastes as good as it looks. As far as I\u2019m concerned, a visit to Sunrise Mart is somewhere between seeing the bats and eating breakfast tacos when it comes to Must Dos in Austin.Go there: Sunrise Bottle ShopExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendAustinWineRecipes you want to make.
