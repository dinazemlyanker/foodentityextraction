It is a small island. Fortunately, nachos are on that island with me, and nothing gets my family fired up like nachos for lunch.The key is never to mess with what my own kids believe to be the most important pieces of nachos, which are refried beans and sharp cheddar cheese. (They are wrong, but that doesn\u2019t stop them from having opinions.) Working with that foundation, I can adapt my approach to whatever else happens to be in the fridge\u2014using leftover sliced or shredded meat and topping them with salsa, yogurt, and/or herbs, depending on what I have.Watch the nachos come to life!\nHere is where I get my revenge. My base nachos recipe is so simple and relies on so many store-bought, ready-to-go products, that I still have time to work in a fresh vegetable. All I need is to follow this simple formula: slice, sear, and sprinkle. Thinly slicing even the bulkiest vegetables, like cauliflower, broccoli, brussels sprouts, or cabbage, then aggressively cooking them in a hot skillet and finishing with a shower of spices means they cook and develop flavor super quickly. This method is orders of magnitude faster than roasting in the oven and completely transforms the vegetables in the process. So much so that my kids don\u2019t even protest.Cauliflower is a standout in this role, becoming vaguely shreddy like carnitas when tender and soaking up tons of flavor for similar intensity. Layered into the nachos during assembly, that spiced cauliflower adds balance to all the other intense flavors and textures going on. Also, let\u2019s face it, if you work some veg into those nachos, you might feel perfectly justified in eating them at least once a week. As far as islands go, that sounds a lot like paradise.Get the Recipe:Lunch Nachos With Spiced CauliflowerTwo words: Lunch nachos!!!!View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titNachosLunchRecipes you want to make.
