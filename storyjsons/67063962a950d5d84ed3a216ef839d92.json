It\u2019s served in a giant colorful bowl with a top shaped like La Calavera Catrina, the fancy lady skeleton of D\u00eda de los Muertos. Follow it up with cochinita pibil, melt-in-your mouth pork roasted slow and low and served on a crisp tortilla under a tangle of red onions. Oh, and then get the mole!THE VIBE IS: super chill, yet reverent of the surroundings. After all, you\u2019re eating under umbrellas smack dab in the middle of a university campus, National Autonomous University of Mexico, which happens to be a UNESCO World Heritage site. But instead of cafeteria plastic, there\u2019s beautiful plateware sourced from local artisans.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day: Monday to Tuesday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Wednesday to Saturday, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Sunday, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.\u2014Hilary CadiganWE ALSO LOVENicosMeet the chef who turned his parents\u2019 restaurant into a pioneer of Mexican \u201cSlow Food\u201dFonda MargaritaWelcome to Mexico City\u2019s breakfast clubBartolaA fresh take on cantina culture for a food-savvy generationExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
