We all loved this salad! My daughter kept saying that it tastes like summer with all the fresh herbs. It was a lot of dressing, but I like the extra just pooled at the bottom of my bowl and didn\u2019t seem to be overwhelming. I used the tiniest clove of garlic that O had on hand since it was raw in the salad, and that was perfect. I can\u2019t wait to be able to bring this salad to an actual potluck. thank you!carolinasfinaChicago, Illinois 4/26/2020I thoroughly enjoyed this salad! I wish I would've split the dressing between my big salad bowl and a jar to save for later. The dressing is delicious but there is bit too much of it for the quantities of vegetables listed. ayycraySeattle4/19/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladLettuceLeafy GreensVegetableRadishEggButtermilkOther IngredientsSpringEasyQuickWeeknight MealsSideNut-FreeGluten-FreeVegetarianKetoHealthyishLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
