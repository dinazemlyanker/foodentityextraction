One day, I\u2019ll be more like our commerce editor Elaheh Nozari, who ends her runs with healthful homemade baked goods. But for now, a bagel is my proverbial carrot. Because I\u2019m training for a marathon, nearly every Sunday starts with logging miles, the best part of which is the final destination: Shelsky\u2019s Brooklyn Bagels.While you\u2019d expect any old bagel in NYC to be pretty good, I\u2019m almost always disappointed\u2014they\u2019re too often small, fluffy, doughy, or pale. But then the famed Brooklyn delicatessen Shelsky's opened up a dedicated bagel shop in Park Slope. God had answered my prayers! The bagels are small but not for ants; chewy but not tough; good enough to devour fresh and without eggs or cream cheese or smoked fish, but not worse for those additions either. Shelsky\u2019s makes good bialys, a Jersey pork roll with egg and cheese that\u2019s been lauded by New York Times critic Pete Wells, and even Sichuan spicy chili crisp cream cheese\u2014not to mention a whole menu of breakfast and lunch sandwiches along with all of the classic bagels (but explicitly not of the blueberry variety).The most remarkable one, however, is the pepper and salt, which is confettied with cracked peppercorns and pretzel salt (they jokingly call it their \u201cbagel au poivre\u201d). The s&p adds crunch, beauty, and also flavor\u2014if it\u2019s been a minute since you\u2019ve tasted the fire of black pepper in cacio e pepe, this will remind you. The peppery heat is a perfect accompaniment to a thick layer of cool, tangy cream cheese that just slightly softens on the warm-from-the-oven bagel.Can you tell how many miles I\u2019ve spent dreaming of that combination? (The answer is hundreds.) Run (or just walk!) to Shelsky\u2019s\u2014I\u2019ll meet you there.Go There: Shelsky\u2019s Brooklyn BagelsExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsNew YorkBrooklynRecipes you want to make.
