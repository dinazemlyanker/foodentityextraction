You get to learn about where they\u2019re from.\u201d\u201cIt depends on the climate,\u201d says Ai Fujimoto of Omiso, a small-batch miso maker in LA known for its miso-dama, or ready-made miso soup balls, inspired by Southern California\u2019s produce. \u201cWhat you think is a \u2018classic\u2019 miso soup depends on where you come from. I\u2019m originally from an area near Kyoto, and what my mom would make is probably very sweet for people from Tokyo.\u201dBecause of its centuries-long history in Japan, miso has developed into distinct regional styles with diverse flavors and colors\u2014from intense dark reddish brown in the coldest, northern prefectures, to mild and pale in the warmer south. And this isn\u2019t exactly a continuous spectrum: Aichi prefecture, where Nagoya is located, is known for its almost black Hatcho miso, while nearby Kyoto prefecture is known for very light Saikyo miso.The salty fermented paste dates so far back in Japanese cooking that even its origins are disputed\u2014some cite evidence of early miso-like foods existing in Japan since the Iron Age (300 BCE\u2013300 AD, give or take), while others think it came more recently from China, when Buddhist priests brought salted soybean paste to Japan during the Tang Dynasty (618\u2013705 AD). Miso as we know it today traces back to at least the 900s, and probably to the 700s. Miso soup\u2014eaten daily in traditional Japanese meals\u2014became a samurai staple in the 12th century.What is miso?While miso has diversified since its earliest days, its basic methods haven\u2019t changed a whole lot. It\u2019s made by mixing cooked soybeans (although alternatives exist) with a grain (usually rice, but barley and soybeans are also traditional) that has been inoculated with Aspergillus oryzae mold a.k.a. koji\u2014the same koji used in sake brewing\u2014and adding salt and water, then leaving it to ferment.\u00a0Miso is a living food and, when allowed to ferment naturally, expresses terroir, a unique flavor profile influenced by the combination of ingredients, climate, and time. (More on this in a minute.) This can yield a gorgeous complexity of aroma and flavor\u2014including a variety of umami, sweet, and floral notes\u2014alongside its earthy saltiness. The characteristics of a given miso paste will be imparted to the dish you use it in.Often, mass market miso rely on commercial koji and accelerated fermentation, along with flavor additives, so they can be more one-note (much like the difference between a low-intervention \u2018natural\u2019 wine versus mass-produced bottles). For quality miso, a good rule of thumb is to look for ingredient labels that list only water, soybeans, koji grain, and salt. Some labels will also list alcohol, which may be added for flavor or be a natural byproduct of fermentation. If there\u2019s more than that listed, it\u2019s probably not high quality. That said, while it\u2019s worth seeking out miso without additives for the complex flavors and probiotic health benefits, a lot of grocery store miso does the job fine, especially if you plan to cook it for more than a minute (cooking for long periods kills the probiotics and removes some nuance anyway).What to look (and taste!) forIf you\u2019re new to miso, you may need to buy some that you don\u2019t end up loving, at least at first, before you figure out your preferences. \u201cBecause there are so many kinds, and every person has a different taste, you have to choose what\u2019s good for your palate,\u201d Moore says. \u201cYou kind of have to give it a try.\u201dBut if you\u2019re looking for pointers, Moore says the best way to tell high-quality miso is to taste it plain (go ahead, eat miso from the jar with a spoon): \u201cIf you can eat the miso on its own, or as a dip with vegetable sticks, that\u2019s good miso.\u201d Look for a lasting finish. \u201cAnd any good miso should have sweetness, which comes from the fermentation, and multi layers of umami.\u201dWhen you\u2019re navigating the miso aisle, consider color, koji type, and saltiness. These are the three characteristics usually used to describe miso, and they\u2019ll tell you a lot about the flavor before you ever taste what\u2019s inside.1. ColorColor is influenced by grain type and fermentation time. Generally, the darker it is, the more intense and salty the miso will taste. Yellow (awase) miso is the most common miso in Japan, and is probably the kind you\u2019ve encountered in miso soup at sushi restaurants. From awase, it gets more intense, with red (aka) miso\u2014dark brown miso with the saltiest, strongest flavors, often fermented for more than a year and made with soybean koji\u2014and white (shiro) miso\u2014usually cream to pale gold, with the mildest, sweetest flavors, fermented quickly, and using rice koji.In general, the darker miso, the saltier and more intense it will taste.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Styling by Emily EisenOn the shiro side of the spectrum, you may have encountered Saikyo miso, a sweet, ultra smooth miso from Kyoto. Its delicate flavor makes it a classic pairing with white-fleshed fish, and in Kyoto-style miso soup. Moore says it\u2019s also incredible mixed into a vanilla ice cream base, and she also uses it liberally in baked goods. I\u2019ve sometimes spread a thin layer on toast under slices of cheddar cheese and apple. Because of its low salt content, Saikyo miso should be eaten within a few months of opening or it may spoil, unlike other varieties.2. KojiEach strain of koji brings its own flavor profile and fermentation speed. Depending on the vigor of the strain of koji and the climate where the miso is made, as well as the desired flavor and texture, miso may be left to ferment anywhere between three months to three years. (Omiso\u2019s Fujimoto says she had to shorten her fermentation time in LA when she switched from Japanese koji to American koji, because the American koji is faster.)The vast majority of miso uses koji grown on white rice, which brings additional sweetness. You may also find miso made with brown rice koji, like the one made by Yamaki Jozo, which has a more nutty flavor (and darker color). Barley koji (mugi miso) imparts a malty aroma, and is common in the south of Japan. Soybean koji (mame miso) ferments for as long as three years, giving it a robust flavor, firm texture, and very dark color. The most famous mame miso is the dark chocolate-colored Hatcho miso, from Aichi prefecture.3. TasteThen there\u2019s sweet (ama), amakuchi (mild), and karakuchi (salty). Most miso falls between five and twelve percent salt by weight, so even sweet miso is salty to taste. In general, the longer the fermentation, the saltier the miso\u2014and the longer its fridge life. That said, while miso can safely last a long time in the fridge, it will begin to oxidize and change flavor after several months. So use it!Keep in mind that color, koji, and saltiness are not mutually exclusive\u2014a miso may be a red miso and a mame miso, for example. And beyond these categories, you may also encounter miso described by its texture, from ultra smooth to chunky country-style (inaka) miso, and of course by regional names, like Saikyo and Hatcho. In this way, miso is once again a bit like wine\u2014you can think of the same bottle as red, light-bodied, pinot noir, or Burgundy.As you get to know your tastes, play around with personalizing miso blends to tailor the saltiness and flavor to your mood and what you\u2019re making. You may find that you like intense red miso with big-flavored ingredients, while delicate white miso won\u2019t mask nuance. \u201cWhen I make miso soup, I always blend two kinds of miso\u2014it brings more depth and layers of flavor without adding anything different,\u201d says Moore. \u201cAnd that way you never get bored!\u201dThe most important lesson in cooking with miso\u2014or honestly, cooking at all\u2014is to taste as you cook. Especially if you haven\u2019t used that same miso in the dish before, it\u2019s best to add a little at a time. And the smoothest way to stir thick miso into a liquid is to blend your scoop with a little bit of that liquid first, to reduce the chance of clumps.How to cook with misoHere are some ideas for how to use it:1. In sauces and dressingsMake a sauce for simple steamed, grilled, or roasted ingredients, whether that\u2019s fish, tofu, or vegetables (it\u2019s especially good with charred shisito peppers). Thin the miso with sake, mirin, dashi, or citrus juice (or a combination!) to a desired sauce thickness and add any additional bright or hot notes like chile or citrus zest, then drizzle it on. Vegetables tossed in a sauce like this get even better if they\u2019ve mellowed in the fridge for an hour before serving.Make kurumi-ae (walnuts) or goma-ae (sesame), a nutty dressing for simply steamed greens. Pound and mash nuts or seeds in a mortar and pestle with a generous scoop of miso, mix with a little bit of rice vinegar until creamy, then toss it through or drizzle it on top.Mix it into salad dressing. Miso is great with acids like rice vinegar or citrus juice, but its malty notes can also be great with apple cider vinegar. Depending on the salad you\u2019re going for and the type of miso you\u2019re using, you may find other vinegars work well too. Hatcho miso and balsamic?This asparagus gets marinated in a mix of mirin and miso before being grilled.\nLaura Murray2. In cures and marinadesBefore you broil, pan sear, or grill, use miso to marinate your fish or meat. This is known as misoyaki (grilled with miso) or miso-zuke (cured or marinated with miso). The marinade can be thinned with sake, mirin, or another liquid to the desired consistency and taste. The salt in the miso draws out moisture from the protein, yielding a tender, flavorful bite, and natural sugars in the miso caramelize with high heat.Use it to cure or pickle (miso-zuke). Wrapping ingredients in straight miso\u2014or miso mixed with a bit of mirin or sake to make a miso-doko\u2014draws out water, firming veggies to a pleasing crunch and imparting a layered saltiness that\u2019s impossible to resist. Refreshing raw vegetables and even fruits\u2014think cucumbers, radishes, apples, and pears\u2014really shine as miso-zuke. Delicate foods like whole boiled eggs, green beans, and firm tofu are best left for just a few hours, then removed from their miso blankets, but hardy vegetables like sliced winter squash (blanch first), quartered root vegetables, and whole garlic cloves can pickle for up to several weeks\u2014just start tasting after a week to monitor progress.\u00a0Peel the vegetables or fruits you want to pickle (it's not required, but it helps the miso to penetrate), then cut into more or less uniform sizes of about 1\u20132-inch thickness minimum; if you try thinner cuts, know that they will get salty very fast and may lose their toothsome texture. Wrap them in miso, smoothing out any air bubbles, and leave them, covered, in the fridge, until ready. When it\u2019s time, scrape off the miso, which will now be watery, and use it to make a sauce or miso soup later.3. In soups and stewsMake miso soup. Regional and seasonal varieties abound across Japan, so feel free to play with any kind of good miso here and develop your own take. Just remember that you don\u2019t need to simmer and simmer miso\u2014it\u2019s best when added at the last moment, just before serving. \u201cI always tell people to enjoy the smell, it\u2019s like a flower opening in the soup,\u201d says Moore. \u201c[Miso soup] is like a flower blossom. You don\u2019t want to kill that, that\u2019s the golden moment for good miso, and that way, all the good flavors, enzymes, and [probiotic] actives in the miso are not killed by over-cooking.\u201dBuild complexity and body into stews, braises, and simmered foods. Miso is excellent in Japanese-style mapo tofu (mabo dofu), Japanese-style curry, donabe dishes, and braised vegetables and meat for a savory, cozy flavor.Use two kinds of miso the next time you make miso soup.\nLaura Murray4. To deliver salt and umamiIn Japanese cuisine, salty things are plain rice\u2019s best friend, and miso is no exception. Take a page from Mika Hatsushima, who owns Brooklyn\u2019s Rice & Miso, the beloved onigiri and lunch spot. Her brown rice onigiri fillings take full advantage of the umami-rich, nutty, salty more-ishness of miso. The signature onigiri uses miso paste mixed with natto, garlic, onions, and scallions, while her miso ground beef filling is simmered with ginger, mirin, and soy sauce. Simmer almost anything with miso, and it will be phenomenal on a bowl of short grain rice.On that note, try mixing it with other nutty grains. Fujimoto swears by a savory miso oatmeal. Or swirl some into savory rice porridge (okayu), risotto, farro salad, or wild rice.Add miso when your dish needs a little something extra but you don\u2019t know what it is. \u201cWherever you want to add a little more salt, if you replace it with miso, it gives it layers of deeper, richer flavor\u201d says Omiso\u2019s Fujimoto. I grew up in a half-Japanese household, and my Spanish American mom has taken to putting it in tomato soup, which is honestly great.Use it in sweets. Because of its texture and nutty flavors, it\u2019s great to experiment with in recipes that call for nut butters like blondies and cookies. Sub out a portion of the nut butter for miso\u2014just be open to a very salty batch before you get the ratio right. (It\u2019s a good idea to be more cautious at first, then ramp up from there.) It\u2019s also excellent in anything where you\u2019d want a salted caramel flavor\u2014whether that\u2019s cake, ice cream, or panna cotta. Hatsushima speaks very highly of it in Rice Krispies treats.\u201cThere are so many benefits in miso, and so much depth to the taste,\u201d Hatsushima says. \u201cEveryone should have it in the fridge.\"Katie Okamoto is a freelance writer based in LA.\u00a0Recipes you want to make.
