Williams employs it here to create a flavorful paste, which he rubs all over a whole chicken before roasting it over root vegetables. It\u2019s a simple but satisfying one-pan meal that welcomes whatever seasonal veg you might have on hand.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I will say that the spice paste was very difficult to spread over the chicken as it clumped very easily. I would favor a berbere dry rub then a brush with oil or melted butter. A lemon in the carcass perfumed the chicken nicely. PaulAnn Arbor, MI1/19/2022I wanted to do a quick version for an easy weeknight meal.  I started with two split breasts and four thighs, used about 1/4 cup of berbere spice, the juice of half a lemon, and two garlic cloves, along with corresponding smaller amounts of olive oil and salt.  After covering the chicken parts with the paste, I tossed the veggies in a bowl with the remnants of the paste and a tsp of Kosher salt, and put everything into the oven at 375 degrees on two sheet pans.  I put the split breasts on the bottom sheet to avoid them drying out.  Cooked for 20 minutes, rotated them, keeping the breasts on the bottom, then finished by putting each sheet under the broiler for two minutes.  I cut the other half of the lemon into wedges, which we squeezed over our plates.  The result was excellent, and the clean-up was a breeze.  This recipe will be a staple going forward!GregWellesley, MA1/4/2022Hope to make this soon.  I found recipes on another cooking site to make my own Berbere.  I wish BA included the steps for homemade spice mixes, since I would guess that many of their readers have big spice collections.  Just started my subscription to BA, too. :) MK in MadvilleMadville PA 11/11/2021For all the questioning - the 1/2 cup of berbere is correct. I made it and it turned out perfectly. My roasting time was a little bit longer but possibly because my oven isn't the hottest. Really great and flavourful. AnonymousCanada10/12/2021Just a thought. I think the recipe meant 1/2 oz. not 1/2 cup of Berbere.  I used Berbere spice from Whole Foods.Silvana9/30/2021I would love to know if the amounts of the ingredients are accurate. Is it 1/2 cup or 2oz. jar of Berber spice? Half Cup was so much and cover the chicken in a paste that burned in the roasting pan. One jar would have been more liquid and less pasty and patchy. I would reconsider this amount - seems like it was double what was necessary for coverage and flavor.Silvana9/28/20211/2 cup berbere - is this berbere paste or sauce?AnonymousCanada9/27/2021what brand of berbere spice do you use and where can I find it ?Anonymous9/20/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titRoasted Vegetablesroast chickenRecipes you want to make.
