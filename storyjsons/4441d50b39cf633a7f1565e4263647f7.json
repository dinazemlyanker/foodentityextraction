They\u2019re so smooth and moisture-wicking, nothing will cling to them. If you want to know what it\u2019s like to try to gunk something to a silicone mat, imagine trying to stick a piece of gum to the skin of a dolphin that just emerged from the water. Not gonna happen.So yes, you do need at least one silicone baking mat\u2014if not for the tactile pleasure it can offer you (dolphin skin!) then for its wide array of uses in the kitchen.First and foremost, it will make your cooking life a little bit easier: It\u2019s reusable (my sheets of pre-cut parchment paper are precious and used sparingly) and it expedites clean-up\u2014I\u2019d scrub a silicone baking mat over a clunky, oil-slicked baking sheet that barely fits in my sink any day.But it has also value beyond convenience: These mats, which are made of silicone woven with heat-conducting fiberglass or nylon fiber mesh, are ideal for candy in the brittle-toffee-bark family, caramelized nuts, meringues, macarons, marshmallows, fussy cookies like tuiles, florentines, wafers, tempered chocolate\u2014basically, all of the stuff that threatens to stick to parchment and drive you absolutely insane. Or, if you have aspirations for perfect cookies but wonky, warped baking sheets that don\u2019t do a great job at heat distribution (I feel your pain!), a layer of silicone will help create a smooth surface, lessening the effect of such flaws.If all of that seems a little too pastry-cheffy for you, don\u2019t count yourself out just yet: Silicone baking mats are also great for the kind of sticky-saucy situations (oven-dried strawberries, soy-glazed chicken thighs, roasted pineapple, bubbling-over galettes, jam-filled rugelach) where you\u2019re worried about burnt-on bits or over-caramelization, or whenever you\u2019re dealing with something particularly delicate (looking at you, salmon skin). Or, if you\u2019ve ever scratched your head at the idea of kneading or rolling dough on a \u201cclean work surface\u201d (there is not one appropriate surface in my apartment that\u2019s clean enough for \u201cwork\u201d), a silicone mat can stand in. It\u2019s the ideal environment\u2014flawless, easily wipeable\u2014to braid challah, shape morning buns or, heck, knead store-bought pizza dough for one of the dozen grilled pizzas you\u2019ll be eating this summer.And now it is my duty to tell you that a silicone mat cannot always replace parchment paper, nor should it always be a barrier between your food and your baking sheet. Because silicone is not as effective a conductor as metal, food won\u2019t brown or crisp to the same extent and cooking times might be longer. Silicone also encourages spreading, resulting in cookies that have an even texture throughout. If you\u2019re aiming for a chocolate chip cookie with a puffy center and a lacey, caramelized edge (this happens when a cookie\u2019s structure sets before it has a chance to spread too far away from the center), you\u2019ll want to skip the silicone and go for parchment instead.But so what? No pan liner can be everything for everyone. There is a time and a place for parchment, for foil, for bare aluminum sheets, and for silicone mats. Invest in one and your future marshmallows will thank you.Photo by Chelsie Craig OXO Good Grips Silicone Baking Mat$21 $17 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingRecipes you want to make.
