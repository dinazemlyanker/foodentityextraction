It was amazing and a little weird to move into a clean-slate apartment with no roommate, no partner, just me, myself, and way too many houseplants. To make the place feel like home, I knew I had to cook. And to cook, I needed spices.I\u2019d left my old jars behind because they were, well, old. Luckily I was given the Spicewalla kitchen essentials collection at just the right time. As promised, the spice collection includes all the essentials\u2014which, turns out, is exactly the same lineup that Carla Lalli Music recommends in her cookbook, Where Cooking Begins.The spices were fresher than I knew spices could be: the cinnamon was spicy and potent, the crushed red pepper flakes were full of heat, and the whole cumin seeds were super fragrant. They come in small containers, which is a good thing because I know I\u2019ll use them before they get dusty. And, at $95 for 18 high-quality containers, this spice collection is an investment I\u2019m happy to make once a year to keep my home-cooked meals tasting fresh. Plus, they look cute on my spice shelf.Photo by Laura MurraySpicewalla 18-Pack Kitchen Essentials$99 $79 at SpicewallaExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendSpiceShoppingRecipes you want to make.
