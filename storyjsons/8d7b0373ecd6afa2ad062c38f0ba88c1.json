Also: a bidet debate.By Alex BeggsMarch 28, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailChristopher BakerFacebookTwitterEmailEvery Friday morning, Bon App\u00e9tit senior staff writer Alex Beggs shares weekly highlights from the BA offices, from awesome new recipes to office drama to restaurant recs, with some weird (food!) stuff she saw on the internet thrown in. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Photo by Laura Murray, food styling by Kat BoytsovaNecessitiesWe got the grocery list for an elderly neighbor upstairs: Pepperidge Farm seeded rye, the latest expiration date possible. A box of Kind bars (any type without milk chocolate). 1 package late expiring bacon. Bag of carrots. 2 red Holland peppers. 1 hard avocado. Saltines. 3 endives if they look ok. 3 potatoes (red, if they\u2019re hard, not old and mealy; otherwise, russets).I had to Google what a Holland pepper was (oh, a bell pepper). But I thought the list was charming, and comforting. It was essential and brief, unlike my list, which was frantic and long, anticipating ten days\u2019 of ambitious cooking projects I\u2019ll probably get to half of. Homemade ravioli? Really?? Will I??? Or is this as much of a ruse as my delusional promise to Aliza Abarbanel I\u2019d come out of this isolation with a six-pack?(Is my neighbor making red pepper and potato sabzi, I wonder! Get the recipe here.)Alex LauThe soup I can\u2019t sayAvgolemono. (My Greek friend says it\u2019s pronounced uv-go / lemon-o, emphasis on the first half. Please don\u2019t tell me if this is wrong.) We made Rick Martinez\u2019s recipe for the Greek lemony chicken and rice soup this week and it\u2019s a good soup. Not sure what else to say. It\u2019s soup.Get the recipe: Lemony Chicken and Rice SoupA prom requestThis week, the Test Kitchen team raised over $70K for No Kid Hungry on Cameo, an app where people pay to get personalized video messages from celebrities (feels weird to type that, but I guess it\u2019s true?!). Christina Chaey asked a teenager to prom. Chris Morocco got to tell a young girl that she is getting a puppy for her birthday next week (!). Someone asked Molly Baz to tell his friend it was time to retire his ratty yellow high school t-shirt. \u201cI was also asked to yell TRANS RIGHTS,\u2019\u201d which I did proudly from my back deck,\u201d said Carla Lalli Music.Photo by Emma Fishman, Food Styling by Yekaterina Boytsova\u00a0When you\u2019re sick of cookingWith millions of people at home cooking way more than usual comes a condition I call \u201cSick of Cooking.\u201d It\u2019s exhausting! The dishes! The splatter! The smoke alarm\u2019s going off again! So I just want to remind you that frozen pizzas exist. I made nachos for dinner one night to eat in front of the TV watching Tiger King (Carole def fed her husband to the tigers) and was excessively happy. Make popcorn. A tin of sardines on mayonnaise-d toast. A peanut butter milkshake. Frozen waffles and jam. Wash your plate in the morning.A few more lazy ideas here.Which brings us toOur most popular recipe of the week, due to strong Google results, was for a baked potato. Lots of baked potato action happening in the world right now. (If that\u2019s boring to you, though, I made Carla\u2019s steamed sweet potatoes with tahini butter this week and then used extra tahini butter on...cabbage? It works, trust.)Get the recipe: Perfect Baked PotatoIf H-E-B ran the worldWe\u2019d all be better off. A story in Texas Monthly about how the grocer H-E-B has been preparing for a pandemic SINCE 2005 is astonishing. Imagine...if...our...government\u2026Read it: How H-E-B Planned for the PandemicUnnecessary meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekCourtesy of TushyThis week, MacKenzie Fegan wrote about her TUSHY, a bidet you can attach to your toilet for a mere $79. \u201cIf you had something dirty on your hands, wouldn't you rather wash them in the sink than wipe them off with 2-ply paper?,\u201d she wrote, convincingly. Well, I\u2019m still irrationally afraid of bidets (like, maybe it will power wash me off the toilet entirely? I dunno!). So is Sarah Jampel. \u201cI feel like I need an explainer, or is it just terribly obvious how to use one?\u201d asked a curious Chris Morocco.But many staff have embraced the TP-free lifestyle. \u201cBidets are beautiful examples of modern innovation,\u201d commented Jesse Sparks definitively. Hilary Cadigan \u201chas been pitching the Bum Gun for YEARS,\u201d she said, though I wonder about that branding. She talked Sohla El-Waylly into buying one. \u201cIf your bidet can't access warm water,\u201d warned experienced Christa Guerra, \u201cyou\u2019re in for a shock.\u201dMolly Baz drifted off into fond memories of bidets past: \u201cUsed to have one, no longer do, think about it every single day of my life,\u201d she sighed. Joseph Hernandez \u201cliterally ordered a TUSHY last week,\u201d to which MacKenzie replied, \u201cDid you get the classic or the SPA?\u201dOthers remained suspiciously silent.What say you, readers?Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecultureTrader Joe\u2019s Latest Snacks, Reviewed in These Strange, Strange TimesBy Alex Beggscooking10 Tips For Keeping Produce Fresh Until Your Next Trip to the Grocery StoreBy Caroline LangeLifestyleHow to Turn One Blender Sauce Into a Week\u2019s-Worth of Delicious MealsBy Aliza AbarbanelCoronavirus7 Tips for Making Your Best Pot of Dried Beans, Even If It's Your FirstBy Caroline LangeRecipes you want to make.
