The hardest part was microplaning the citrus but aside from that, a sure winner.  Made this with the Trini Eggplant, which helped to make the meal.  Will be making this one again.Mary EllenPortland, OR4/26/2021Just made these with the eggplant stew.  Really good.  Seems like this recipe could also be the foundation to a more complicated recipe.  Next time I might add a tiny bit of butter at the end when making the sauce, but you don't need to!BenLos Angeles, CA1/28/2021These are delicious and super easy. If you feel the sauce is too tart or citrusy may I suggest adding a pinch or two of sugar to help mellow the flavor. I resisted the urge to mount the sauce with butter and am glad I did. It ends up being supremely bright and tart and dresses whichever vegetables you serve it with perfectly. This is a great recipe to have in your back pocket. MikeNew York 1/13/2021This recipe had way too much citrus. I had my doubts going into this, and they were confirmed. Like others have commented, there is no balance here. I think they might need to go back to the drawing board with this one.Chris Y.San Jose, CA11/18/2020I loved this recipe! I understand the concerns about the citrus, but I paired it with steamed rice and the Trini stewed eggplant and the 3 of them balanced it all out perfectly! I also added a healthy handful of fresh chopped basil to the rice and the bitter rounded out the profile. Probably one of the best things I've made since Quarantine!AnonymousPortland, OR8/18/2020Holy citrus, Batman! This pan sauce is completely unbalanced \u2014 definitely needs a few more ingredients to mellow out the citrus juice. AnonymousWashington, DC8/18/2020Incredible, so tasty and refreshing, loved the amount of citrusAnonymousChicago, US8/17/2020Way too much acid and zing even after following other reviewer's suggestion to add chicken stock. I would eat this with quinoa and a cucumber salad on a hot day, but I don't think I would ever crave this chicken.Sweet ElizabethWashington, US8/14/2020This was a tough one chicken was tasty, but the citrus was overwhelming. The sauce was unbalanced. Needed chicken stock or butter. Maybe both. AnonymousNevada8/12/2020This was a really easy recipe, but we found it to be unbalanced in its citrus flavor. I think I'd make it again, but I'd cut maybe 1/3-1/2 of the lemon and lime juice with some chicken stock so that it isn't so sharp.
