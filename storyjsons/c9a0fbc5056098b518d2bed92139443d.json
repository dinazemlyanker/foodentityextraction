Much. Better.By Bon App\u00e9titFebruary 26, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by David AlvaradoFacebookTwitterEmailThe perfection of some sandwiches lies in their simplicity (say, a ham and cheese with nothing but the highest quality ham, cheese, and don\u2019t forget the butter). Others, however, benefit from a little something extra\u2014a secret sauce that\u2019s not necessarily a secret sauce, if you will. They\u2019re the X-factor ingredients or techniques that take a sandwich to the next level, where it goes from being lunch to a true revelation between two pieces of bread. We asked chefs to share the little tricks they rely on that distinguish their dishes from our home versions.A BLT is all about simplicity, but a suped-up mayonnaise won't hurt\u2014recipes here.\nChristopher TestaniDoctor Up Your Mayo\u201cWe do a special sauce, which is mayo, ketchup, mustard, and chopped dill pickles. That\u2019s pretty much good on everything. We also make Russian dressing, which is mayo-based. And our white sauce is based off of a New York City halal truck, which is mayo and vinegar, so we make one with mayo, sour cream, and white vinegar.\u201d \u2014Kevin Pemoulie, Mean Sandwich, SeattleCut Down on the Bread\u201cWhen you get a sandwich that\u2019s half bread or more, that\u2019s a real bummer. We\u2019ll slice [our rolls] open and pull a little bit of the bread from the inside as soon as they walk in from the baker. You [want] all the crust, but to keep the focus on what\u2019s inside. It\u2019s laborious on top of the labor we\u2019re paying for to have the bread made, but it\u2019s our number-one rule.\u201d \u2014Megan Sanchez and Alec Morrison, G\u00fcero, Portland, ORPut Something Crispy On It\u201cI\u2019m all about crispy bits\u2014fried quinoa, crispy shallots, sugar-fried garlic [sliced garlic tossed in sugar, then fried], and toasted sesame seeds. These things bring a ton of flavor and texture variance to each bite.\u201d \u2014Joseph Frietze, Publican Quality Meats, ChicagoIf you\u2019re headed to Durham soon, get a big sandwich at Lucky\u2019s (and send us pics).\nPhoto by D.L. AndersonUse Chunky Almond Butter Where You Least Expect It\u201cWe make a chunky almond butter and put that on our chicken salad sandwich with bacon. There\u2019s something a little over the top about it, but they go really\nwell together.\u201d \u2014Drew Brown, Lucky's Deli, Durham, NCTwo Sauces Is Better Than One\u201cIf you can use two sauces, it\u2019ll be that much more interesting. Our Italian grinder has an aioli and an oregano vinaigrette. Our cauliflower banh mi has a Thai vinaigrette and a spicy mayo.\u201d \u2014Todd Ginsberg, Fred's Meat & Bread, AtlantaGriddle with Something Extra\u201cWe brush guajillo paste onto some of our rolls before griddling. It creates this savory dark red chile bread that gets extra crispy. At home you could use sauce from\na can of chipotles in adobo.\u201d \u2014Megan Sanchez and Alec Morrison, G\u00fcero, Portland, ORThe collard green melt from Turkey and the Wolf was so good we had to get the recipe.\nPhoto by Alex LauFreshen Things Up\u201cIf you want to put herbs on your sandwich, put way more than you think you need. Just go huge on herbs. We definitely like to do dill, mint, basil, all that kind of stuff.\u201d \u2014Mason Hereford, Turkey and the Wolf, New OrleansThis chutney also takes a pimiento grilled cheese to the next level:Explore Bon App\u00e9titSandwichRead MorecookingHow to Make Special Sauce, a Perfect CondimentBy Alex DelanyLifestyleFermented Hot Sauce Is Definitely Having a MomentBy Juno DeMelorecipes38 Sandwiches We'd Make Over and Over AgainGallery38 SlidesBy Danielle WalshRecipes you want to make.
