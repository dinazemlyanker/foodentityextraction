If your stew skews hot, just top it with a dollop of minty yogurt for instant relief. You can also make the stew 12 hours ahead to really let all the flavors meld, but this step is totally optional. Serve the stew as the centerpiece surrounded by fixings that guests can pick and choose to build their own bowls.Ingredients8 servings Toasted Cauliflower Crumbs\u00bdmedium head of cauliflower3Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oilKosher salt, freshly ground pepperLemony Mint Yogurt1cup plain whole-milk Greek yogurt3Tbsp. finely chopped mint1Tbsp. fresh lemon juiceKosher salt, freshly ground pepperStew and Assembly5lb. lamb shanks (about 6), patted dryKosher salt, freshly ground pepper\u00bccup extra-virgin olive oil2large red onions, peeled, cut into 1\" wedges2heads of garlic, top third removed13\" stick cinnamon or \u00bd tsp. ground cinnamon1\u00bdtsp. coriander seeds, crushed3Tbsp. harissa pasteTorn pitted Castelvetrano olives, mint leaves, and/or finely chopped preserved lemon (for serving; optional)PreparationToasted Cauliflower CrumbsStep 1Coarsely chop cauliflower and pulse in a food processor until about the size of grains of rice (or, you can very finely chop with a knife instead). You should have about 2 cups.Step 2Heat oil in a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high. Cook cauliflower, stirring often, until golden brown all over and charred in spots, 6\u20138 minutes. Remove from heat; season with salt and pepper. Let cool in skillet.Lemony Mint YogurtStep 3Mix yogurt, mint, and lemon juice in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper.Step 4Do Ahead: Yogurt can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.Stew and AssemblyStep 5Season lamb shanks very generously all over with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high. Working in 2 batches, cook lamb shanks in a single layer, turning occasionally, until browned all over, 8\u201312 minutes per batch. As the shanks finish cooking, transfer to a large plate.Step 6Reduce heat to medium; add onions and garlic, cut side down, to the same pot and cook, tossing onions occasionally, until onions are browned in spots and garlic is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add cinnamon and crushed coriander and cook, stirring constantly, until spices are very fragrant, about 1 minute. Add harissa paste and cook, stirring often and scraping bottom of pot, until vegetables are coated and paste is slightly darkened in color, about 2 minutes. Add 7 cups water, stirring to release any bits stuck on bottom of pot. Season generously with salt and pepper and bring to a simmer. Return lamb shanks to pot and bring stew back up to a simmer. Cover with a lid, leaving slightly askew so steam can escape, and cook, adjusting heat to maintain a very gentle simmer and skimming foam from surface as needed, until meat is tender and easily pulls away from bones, 1\u00bd\u20132 hours.Step 7Transfer lamb shanks to a cutting board and let cool 10\u201315 minutes; keep liquid at a simmer. Pull meat from bones and tear into bite-size pieces. Add bones back to pot as you go. Transfer meat to a medium bowl and cover with plastic wrap.Step 8Simmer bones in broth, uncovered, until liquid is thick and very flavorful, 25\u201330 minutes. Remove from heat; add meat back to pot and let cool uncovered (bones and all) until no longer steaming. Cover pot and chill stew at least 12 hours (you can skip this step, but it will dramatically improve the flavor).Step 9Uncover stew and spoon off half to three-quarters of fat on the surface; discard. Gently reheat stew until barely simmering. Pluck out and discard bones and garlic heads (don't worry about any cloves that may have escaped into stew). Taste and season with more salt and pepper if needed. Ladle into bowls and serve with Toasted Cauliflower Crumbs, Mint Yogurt, harissa, and olives, mint leaves, and/or preserved lemon as desired.Step 10Do Ahead: Stew can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.How would you rate Warm-Spiced Saucy Lamb Stew?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (4)Back to TopTriangleI really liked it, but I like a rich stew. Next time I would use a little more harissa. I made it for myself and my husband and for the first night we didn't even skim the fat off. I will when I portion the rest out for leftovers though.AnonymousVancouver, Canada1/17/2020There were many flavors to love here, but the shanks were just so fatty that I was disappointed. I found myself spending more time avoiding fatty looking pieces of meat than enjoying tender lamb in the stew. As others have mentioned, the lack of direction on the garlic is also frustrating. You need to figure out how to improvise. I just chopped up the smashed garlic the boring way because I wasn't sure what to do about the skins. It looked pretty though... AshleyBrookeWashington, DC11/9/2018Really wanted to like to like this stew, but it came out way too gelatinous and fatty (and that was after waiting 12 hours, and scrapping about 1.5 cups of solid fat off the top). It might better if you used only 1 lamb shank, and the remainder of the meat was cubed leg of lamb or something with less fat and marrow. It would have also been nice to have some vegetables in the soup. It was a one note stew: fatty meat. Wouldn\u2019t bother with this one without some major alterations to the recipe. Concerning the comment about when to pull out the garlic, I cooked it the whole time, and then squeezed the cloves out and whisked them in.
