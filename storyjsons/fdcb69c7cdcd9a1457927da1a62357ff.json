Even as an adult, as I moved myself from country to country, first for school, then for work, all I needed were a few key ingredients and I could recreate that comfort\u2014the smells and tastes of my family\u2019s cooking, and love. But two years ago, when I finally moved back to Mumbai, that relationship was transformed.In Singapore and Brisbane, where I\u2019d lived before, I had access to great produce. I could go to farmers\u2019 markets or supermarkets; I could get herbs and experiment with golden squash blossoms in any season. And though I\u2019ve always been conscious of food waste\u2014drilled into me by my mother\u2014if there were a few bites of leftover pilaf after a meal, it went into the compost without undo guilt. Then I moved to Mumbai. Suddenly I was without a grocer who could supply me with dollar Hass avocados in January. \u201cExotic\u201d and non-indigenous herbs such as rosemary and lavender were incredibly expensive. And it wasn\u2019t just certain foods I had less of, but living space, too. I moved into a 290-square-foot apartment\u2014tiny, even for Mumbai. Being waste conscious was no longer a choice I could make; it was a necessity.In India, 50 million people may be living on less than $1.90 a day, and a 2016 survey found that less than thirty percent of Indian families owned a fridge (the cost of a single door, 52-liter fridge is $150). Food is cooked and eaten fresh daily. There are no microwaves; there's no reheating leftovers unless it's on a stove. And there's no affordable fast food unless it's street food wrapped in newspaper or served in pattal with a wooden spoon\u2014the Mumbai government did away with single-use plastic in 2018.As I settled into my new home, I noticed how, probably because of this, there appeared to be a predominant culture of reuse and ingenuity: sugarcane juice vendors welded carts to tractors and cycles; dosa batter was scooped with a flat-bottomed bowl that doubled as a spreader to make the dosas paper thin; naans were made on stoves instead of the traditional tandoor; and in homes, stove-top ovens sat on counters.There\u2019s a word for this kind of ingenuity. \u201cJugaad\u201d\u2014where resources fail and resourcefulness steps in. A uniquely Indian concept, the word is a catchall term for many things. For cutting corners, for being innovative\u2014it's what people have to do to get by, it's the length they\u2019ll go to seek out the Indian dream. Jugaad rejects consumerism by necessity and shows the astonishing possibilities that arise when people are forced to make do with what they have.The word, like my understanding of it, has evolved over the years. Growing up, I understood jugaad to be somewhat dirty, like \u201chacking.\u201d The connotation was something broken into, or forced outside its typical function. By the time I\u2019d moved to Mumbai, after India\u2019s tech startup boom, it had become a buzzword. Jugaad, said the business experts, described what made Indian innovation innovative.Jugaad rejects consumerism by necessity and shows the astonishing possibilities that arise when people are forced to make do with what they have.Jugaad is a philosophy that now extends into most areas of my life. Like my living space. In a 290-square-foot apartment, everything has to have a purpose, and most things have to have a second or third purpose. My pressure cooker\u2019s lid can be used as a saucepot. My mini egg-frying pan doubles as a tadka pan. My multi-purpose, six-person French press has recently added \u201cnut-milk strainer\u201d to its list of functions. I\u2019ve learned that old glass Perrier bottles can be filled with cleaning suds (spray nozzles fit perfectly, I swear), and my toaster-oven-friendly Madeleine mould is great for shell-shaped ice or serving ice cream. I love making fresh pasta, but the little bit of counter space I have has rounded edges and my pasta press won\u2019t clamp onto it. So now the Murphy bar (like a Murphy bed, it\u2019s a little bar top attached to the wall), sanded down, is for pasta, too. It\u2019s also an ironing board, a divider between my \"bedroom\" and kitchenette, and of course, a dining table. When I host, my guests stand around it.And I\u2019ve learned to find local substitutes for things I miss. Guava cheese and aam papad, the sweet variety, is a great substitute to membrillo on a cheese platter. I grow herbs I can\u2019t otherwise get. I\u2019ve even come to enjoy many vegetables I didn\u2019t have back in Australia\u2013\u2013mustard greens, bathua (pigweed), jackfruit, and parval (pointed gourd), to name a few.But there\u2019s a second and very important component to my jugaad practice, which is that it\u2019s a de facto low-waste lifestyle. Growing up, my mother was strict about food waste. If my sister and I served ourselves outrageous portions we were made to eat everything on our plates. No exceptions. \u201cThere are kids in India who don\u2019t get one meal a day,\u201d she\u2019d say. It was one thing to know that food scarcity was the reality for a large majority of people\u2014both through my mother\u2019s words and our sheltered family visits to India\u2014but it is quite another to live beside it.In many parts of the world, we\u2019ve made the idea of going \u201clow-waste\u201d harder than it needs to be. After two years living in Mumbai, practicing jugaad, I live a low-waste lifestyle almost by accident, and I\u2019m a better cook for it. Veggie scraps make for good broth, citrus peels mixed with vinegar make a pleasant countertop cleaning spray, or coated in sugar, a good candy. Broccoli, kale, and cauliflower stems are, I\u2019ve learned, edible. Leftover okara from a freshly made batch of soy milk is great for both a hummus-type dip, crackers, and biscotti.Since living in Mumbai, I\u2019ve come to realize that my unequivocal love of food had in fact been skewed by privilege. Living with the restrictions and realities has taught me a new way to cook, and eat. I used to think that food was a symbol of my culture and my mother\u2019s care, but now it\u2019s the act of jugaad\u2014not wasting it\u2014that matters more.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishessayRead MoreLifestyleOur Favorite New Books For Climate-Friendly Cooking and LifeGallery4 SlidesBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
