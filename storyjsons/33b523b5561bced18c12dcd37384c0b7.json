Scale this dish to suit your needs by roasting one big bone for an intimate dinner for two or go full Flintstone with a five-bone plate, which will generously serve six to eight. The cooking time and method will remain the same. Call your butcher in advance to reserve this cut and ask for the thickest short ribs they have. This recipe is part of Sohla El-Waylly\u2019s Thanksgiving-for-two-or-maybe-eight feast, see the full menu here.Ingredients4 - 8 Servings\u00bccup garam masala\u00bccup Diamond Crystal or 2 Tbsp. plus 2 tsp. Morton kosher salt3Tbsp. light brown sugar1tsp. MSG (optional)13\u20135-bone beef short rib plate roast (3\u20135 lb.)3Tbsp. vegetable oil, divided\u00bccup reserved Citrus-Ginger Raita\u00bccup finely chopped raw pistachiosFlaky sea saltPreparationStep 1Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil; set a wire rack inside. Whisk garam masala, salt, brown sugar, and MSG (if using) in a small bowl. Trim any silver skin and excess fat from short ribs and pat dry with paper towels. Rub all over with 1 Tbsp. oil, then generously coat with dry rub, pressing to adhere (you may not need all of it). Place on prepared baking sheet. Chill, uncovered, at least 12 hours and up to 2 days (the longer the better).Step 2Let short ribs sit at room temperature 1 hour before baking.Step 3Preheat oven to 250\u00b0. Drizzle 1 Tbsp. oil over meat. Pour 1 cup water into prepared baking sheet and cover tightly with foil. Bake until meat is tender (when you tug at a bone, it should feel like it will slip right out), 4\u20135\u00bd hours (grass-fed beef will cook faster than grain-fed).Step 4Remove short ribs from oven; increase oven temperature to 325\u00b0. Uncover meat. Spread top with raita, then sprinkle with pistachios, gently pressing to adhere. Drizzle with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil; season with sea salt. Roast until nuts are golden brown, 30\u201335 minutes. Remove from oven; let rest 15 minutes before serving.Step 5Do ahead: Roast (without crust) can be baked 2 days ahead. Let cool (keep covered), then chill. To reheat, add \u00bd cup water to baking sheet, wrap tightly, and bake at 325\u00b0 until warmed through, 30\u201340 minutes.How would you rate Garam Masala Short Rib Roast With Pistachio Crust?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleMade these for Christmas Dinner.  They were delicious, super easy to do and a real show stopper!  Looked exactly like they did in the photos.   How awesome is that?  BrandyHouston, TX12/27/2020These were SO easy, truly delicious and made for a very impressive presentation. The left over Raita was fabulous with naan as well. I used boneless short ribs instead of bone in, same cooking instructions and came out perfect.
