You can pre-roast the vegetables, and then whenever you\u2019re ready, throw them in the pan with your spices and onions to finish the dish in 15 minutes.Indian-ish\u00a9 2019 by Priya Krishna with Ritu Krishna.

(or more) kosher salt1Tbsp. (or more) fresh lime juice\u00bdcup chopped cilantro leaves with tender stemsPreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 400\u00b0. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Toss potatoes and cauliflower with 3 Tbsp. oil on prepared sheet. Spread in an even layer and roast, tossing once halfway through, until cauliflower and potatoes are browned and slightly crisped, about 30 minutes. Let cool.Step 2Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high until it begins to shimmer. Add cumin and cook, stirring frequently, until they turn a medium shade of brown, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium and swirl in turmeric. Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until translucent, 4\u20136 minutes. Add ginger, asafetida (if using), and chili powder and cook, stirring, until heated through and well combined, about 1 minute longer.Step 3Stir in roasted potatoes and cauliflower, including any charred bits from the foil, and gently mix (don\u2019t overmix, or the cauliflower will fall apart). Add salt and cook, tossing occasionally, until potatoes and cauliflower are tender (but not soggy!), 5\u20136 minutes. Remove from heat and add lime juice. Taste and add more lime juice or salt, if needed.Step 4Transfer potatoes and cauliflower to a platter.

I too roasted a little bit longer. Overall, super simple recipe and amazing flavor profile. Jackie BMontreal, Canada10/6/2021I agree:\n6/5!!\nWell done Priya and Priya's mum.\nSometimes cheat and add dark greens, because I don't know any better, and I can, and it is delicious.K. BakerOntario, Canada9/14/2021I'd give this 6 stars. It's a simple dish but there's so much satisfaction to eat it even on its own. The lime juice added another dimension to this dish, don't omit it.  I also liked that this version is not so oily. Thank you for sharing!AnonymousSingapore8/3/2021Thank you, Priya! I cannot get enough of this recipe. Love the matchstick ginger for a different texture & would recommend adding garlic & more heat as well. It's great as-is, but last time I made it with a few extras & it was amazing: Cubed paneer pan-fried in oil with turmeric & cumin seed, cubed leftover grilled chicken breast if I have it, last night I threw in some julienned basil (because summer) & topped everything with arugula. As other reviewers have mentioned, I could totally see adding chickpeas or fresh peas to the mix for another little pop.JoshMKE, WI 7/9/2021I've tried several different aloo gobi recipes, but this is by far the best. I used small honey gold potatoes and just cut them in half. The flavor was incredible and the vegetables weren't mushy at all.Bob SPhiladelphia, PA5/29/2021Soooo delish and really fool-proof. Made two big batches in a row and have been eating it nonstop since. I added peas, too, for a lil extra sweetnessLucy SNew York2/11/2021Wow! Didn't know what to expect from this... but had to try based on Priya's other recipes.  Easy to make. Convection setting in oven helps with the crisp of the veg.  Very comforting.  Bought her cookbook filled with other equally awesome dishes.JTMadison, WI1/17/2021This is one of my favorites, so delicious and easy. It makes great leftovers, heat it up in the oven and the potatoes and cauliflower get even crispier all over. I\u2019ve been serving it with rice and Priya\u2019s cilantro chutney from her cookbook, a weeknight favorite! Jess Worcester, MA11/18/2020I've made this  4 or 5 times - it's become one of my favourite suppers. Seriously addictive. I follow the recipe pretty closely, but use maybe 1/2  tsp of chilli powder to give it a little more heat. 30 minutes in the oven is not quite enough in mine - I wait till there are major brown bits, closer to 40 minutes. It takes what it takes, and is worth waiting for.RobVancouver BC11/17/2020How is this Aloo Gobi??? No curry/sauce that accompanies it...this is dry. At least say this is a healthy adaptation attempt or something...come on. AnonymousWashington, DC11/10/2020This is a ten!  It takes a little time but it will be a family favorite.  I double the spices but seriously so delicious and its good for you.  I am not the greatest cook but if I can make it anyone can make it.  I love cooking the spices first it really gives the dish a kick.  I was a little intimidated by a Bon Appetit recipe, again because of my cooking skills, but don't be.  Karen EdlingCA11/8/2020Love the idea of roasting the veg for this dish, but just one suggestion - mix the spices (cumin, tumeric and I also added garam masala) with the oil and toss with the veg BEFORE roasting. It adds sooo much more flavour than adding at the end!!! I also threw in some chickpeas about halfway through roasting for protein. It was fantastic!AnonymousToronto, ON10/30/2020Ummm yeah this thing is FREKIN DELICIOUS. It's so flavorful it's like stupid good. SO TASTYYYY.  Please make this dish.NnnnnnnCalifornia, US10/15/2020Everyone has to make this!! This is pretty much one of my favorite dishes. You end up eating a lot of cauliflower, and it's vegetarian but extremely satisfying! I always follow the recipe completely (I just leave out the cilantro if I don't have it and use a lemon if I don't have limes) and serve it on top of basmati rice (I live with a big eater), and despite being dry and not saucy, the aloo gobi completely holds its own against the rice. It's really amazing! I don't know if the people who found it bland didn't have asafoetida, but I do think this really helps in the dish. I guess you can replace it with another umami source like some fish sauce if you don't have it? Anyway, highly recommended!!celinenerdThe Netherlands7/11/2020Hearty and comforting, more on the gentle side with the flavor profile but that's what lets the earthy potatoey-ness just give you a big old hug.
