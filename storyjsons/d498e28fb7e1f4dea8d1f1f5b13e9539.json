I'm assuming you already knew this because one of its most popular accessories, the coated non-stick inner pot, is currently sold out (in 5 and 6 quart) on Instant Pot's official website, and was out of stock on Amazon until this week. But it's back, baby...at least on Amazon. Jeff Bezos is the richest man in history because he knows what the Instant Pot community wants.The standard Instant Pot comes with a stainless steel cooking pan, which is great for making all the shredded chicken, pork, and beef your winter body desires, but what about when you want to tap into the pot's other functions, like cooking rice? You could use the stainless steel pot, but you know what makes rice cookers so failproof and convenient? Non-stick pots. This one is Teflon-free and can go in the dishwasher (top rack!). Just know that it's not 100% ceramic, but a ceramic-coating on an aluminum pot.Amazon reviewers mention making quiche with it, yogurt, pasta, and other starchy dishes. Because the Instant Pot's heat comes from the center of the appliance, it can create a scalding hotspot in the middle when you're using it to saut\u00e9 or brown meat, so the nonstick option adds another layer that keeps the hotspot from, well, getting too hot. Super-users also like having the second pot for cooking multiple dishes in a row\u2014while one cools, you can simply take it out and put in the second pot. Use one pot to make shredded chicken, the other to make rice, and what's that but chicken and rice for dinner?!Buy it: Instant Pot Ceramic Non-Stick Inner Pot, $20 for a 6-quart pot on AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingInstant PotTrendsRead MorecultureHow to Clean Your Smelly Instant Pot Sealing RingBy Alex BeggscultureThe Instant Pot\u2019s Master Plan to Invade All of Our KitchensBy Alex BeggscultureThe Instant Pot Will Change Your Life\u2014No JokeBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
