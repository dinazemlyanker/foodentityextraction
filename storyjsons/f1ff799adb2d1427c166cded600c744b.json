Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,I\u2019ve smoked weed intermittently for over a decade, and I\u2019ve never really found my zone. I get sleepy. Or I get anxious. Or I get sleepy and then wake up a couple hours later...anxious. Last time I was in a legal state, I bought a bag of cannabis-laced granola clusters, ate half of one, and showed up an hour late to a lunch date because I became obsessed with the bed in my Airbnb. Even my CBD experiences have been mixed, and I don\u2019t have the patience (or the supply) to experiment forever.Despite these failures\u2014or we can call them non-successes\u2014I\u2019ve closely followed cannabis culture as it edges further into the mainstream. I\u2019ve dug into the many reported health benefits, swooned over the ceramic pipes and other luxury accessories, and read up on the racist legal history. But I\u2019ve heard less about the grayer areas of cannabis use, like what happens when smoking or consuming weed isn\u2019t actually as healthy as the wellness world suggests.Earlier this week, we published T. Wise\u2019s essay on what he describes as a weed dependency. \u201cWeed is complicated for me,\u201d he writes. \u201cI know that I\u2019m much more productive without it, that I\u2019m too quick to curl up with it as a way to avoid others, my desires, and my fears.\u201d Wise has tried different strategies\u2014cutting it out, setting boundaries around when he can smoke\u2014but he struggles with the very idea of moderation: \u201cI am not a moderate person, and I have no desire to be. At best, being moderate feels like being average, not sure enough to go one way or another. At worst it feels like diluted truth.\u201dUltimately he lands in a place that will sound familiar to anyone who\u2019s struggled with moderation in any area: \u201cIf smoking is my ritual, then I need other rituals. If smoking is my therapy, I need other therapy. Only then can I trust that what I do, what I smoke, is not an attempt to escape but a way to keep exploring.\u201d T.'s piece has made me think about the things I rely on to escape, and how I can make my relationship with them a little more, well, healthyish.Is it time for breakfast yet?\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Food styling by Sue LiAlso New This WeekA healthyish breakfast sandwich recipe with a photo I can\u2019t stop staring at.
