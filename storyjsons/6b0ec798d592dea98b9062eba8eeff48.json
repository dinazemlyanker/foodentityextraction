If that\u2019s not an option, shell-on shrimp will also do the trick. Eat them shells and all to take advantage of their crispy yet tender texture. This recipe from chef Anthony Salguero of Popoca in Oakland is inspired by a dish he ate at La Cocina Central in San Salvador.Ingredients4 Servings1lb. extra-jumbo shell-on shrimp, preferably head-on2Tbsp. Relajo1tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt4Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided6garlic cloves, thinly sliced2Tbsp. sour cream3limes, halved1cup coarsely chopped cilantroFlaky sea saltPreparationStep 1Using kitchen scissors and working one at a time, cut through shrimp shells along the length of their backs just deep enough into flesh to expose the vein; remove. Pat shrimp dry.Step 2Toss shrimp with Relajo, kosher salt, and 1 Tbsp. oil in a medium bowl. Heat remaining 3 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Cook shrimp in a single layer, undisturbed, until crisp and browned underneath, about 2 minutes. Turn over and cook until crisp on the other side, about 1 minute. Immediately add garlic and cook, shaking pan often, until garlic is just golden, about 1 minute.Step 3Remove pan from heat and stir sour cream and 2 Tbsp. water into shrimp (it will look split). Squeeze in juice from limes and add cilantro. Transfer to a platter; sprinkle with sea salt.How would you rate Camarones con Relajo?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (1)Back to TopTriangleI have made this recipe about a dozen times.  It is always delicious and can be prepared quickly, once you have assembled the Relajo spices.
