RossMay 12, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Katie BennFacebookTwitterEmailIn Unfiltered, Bon Appetit's wine editor Marissa Ross shares her latest favorite bottles and\u2014you guessed it\u2014unfiltered thoughts on natural wine.What wine do I want to drink right now? It\u2019s a simple question and one that I\u2019ve asked myself thousands of times. In fact, it\u2019s the question that started this column. This month, however, I had to ask myself a much harder version: What wine do I want to drink after I\u2019ve recovered from [every expletive ever] shingles?Spending nearly a month on the couch chowing down on antivirals, opiates, vitamins, and every season of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race gave me a lot of time to think about it. The day before my rash went from garden-variety hives to blistering hell, I\u2019d bought three mixed cases of wine. My wine fridge overfloweth with Italian reds and German blends while I panicked over which bottle I would write about in the two to six weeks these [every expletive ever] shingles were going to take to heal.But on the day the doc cleared my health, I knew exactly what I wanted to drink. I immediately opened the fridge and popped Cruse Wine Co.\u2019s Valdigu\u00e9 p\u00e9tillant naturel. It\u2019s a wine I always relish in the long spring-into-summer afternoons. The naturally sparkling wine made from California\u2019s historically beloved grape Valdgui\u00e9 (once known as \u201cNapa Gamay\u201d for its light, fruity juice) pours into the glass all peachy and pink. It fizzes with the fond aromas of strawberry shortcake, playful and warm, inviting you to take a sip. It tastes like a dessert you might find at Disneyland\u2014let\u2019s call it Whipped SweetTarts\u2014made of sour blackberries, strawberries and oh-so-soft hibiscus cream. It\u2019s celebratory and it\u2019s dreamy, and by the time you look down at the glass, you\u2019ll realize it\u2019s halfway gone.Here\u2019s the thing about award-winning California winemaker Michael Cruse\u2019s sparkling wines: They are fantastic, at times even fantastical, but they are also reliable. Consistency, whether it be from bottle to bottle or vintage to vintage, has become an underrated quality in the natural wine world; one could argue that it\u2019s even maligned. I\u2019m not innocent in this\u2014I\u2019m the one who buys mixed cases looking to discover bottles that taste unlike anything I ever have before. But I didn\u2019t even think of those wines when I had finally kicked shingles. I opened a bottle I love and always go back to this time of year\u2014year after year.Buy it: 2019 Cruse Wine Co Sparkling Valdiguie, $41All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
