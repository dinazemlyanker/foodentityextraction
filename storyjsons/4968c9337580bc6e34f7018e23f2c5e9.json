I\u2019ve long had a pattern of oscillating between the two, which has reinforced the deep-seated, internalized belief that my worth is defined by what I do (or don\u2019t) eat. This long-held belief explains why I\u2019ve always felt high highs during the \u201cextremely healthy\u201d phases and very low during the \u201cextremely unhealthy\u201d times.I\u2019ve been riding an extreme high this week, buried in one of my favorite cookbooks, Whole Food Cooking Every Day by Amy Chaplin. Desperately seeking a change of pace from a meat/alcohol/sugar/dairy/gluten-filled summer, I spent this week converting into a loyal disciple of the gluten-, dairy-, and sugar-free life the book\u2019s pages present so appealingly. My fridge is positively bursting with soaked beans, soaked nuts, soaked seeds (do you sense a pattern here?), and soaked grains. My days start with apple-citrus chia bircher bowls with homemade almond milk and end with a big bowl of steamed vegetables drizzled with tahini. I snack on homemade gluten-free black rice bread spread with homemade toasted pistachio butter. Raisins are my treat.I\u2019ve done this at least once or twice a year for at least a decade, swearing off entire food groups for an arbitrary (and always temporary) period, and, as always, the payoff this time has been swift: I have more energy. I don\u2019t crave my nightly ice cream. My digestion is as calm as a placid sea. At the same time, I\u2019m aware of another familiar phenomenon creeping in: All my waking thoughts are consumed by what I\u2019m going to cook and eat. I\u2019ve noticed I haven\u2019t been making plans with friends on an otherwise relatively free week because I\u2019m worried about getting hungry during our hang and not having anything \u201capproved\u201d to eat. If I get into bed at night and realize I\u2019ve forgotten to soak nuts/beans/etc. for the next day\u2019s meals, I\u2019ll get out of bed and make sure it gets done. I know how quickly this way of living can become...not ideal for me. This is by no means a knock on any particular book or on special diets at large. And I know I\u2019m extremely privileged to be able to make daily choices about what I\u2019d like to eat or not eat. But the truth is that I still struggle with this cycle of good foods and bad foods, good weeks and bad weeks, and how they feed into my sense of self. It feels endless sometimes, and I\u2019m tired of it.What does a better way forward look like? I\u2019ve been trying to answer that question for years, and I\u2019m only recently starting to find answers. Rather than hang onto those temporary highs for as long as I can before I descend back into \u201cbad food\u201d territory, rinse and repeat, I\u2019m thinking about how I can take certain practices from these so-called \u201chealthy\u201d periods and apply them in a more sustainable way. I might not always have the time or desire to make my own nut butter, but I can definitely find time to whisk storebought almond butter with some grated ginger, lemon juice, and honey into a nutritious sauce for fish or roasted vegetables. If I don\u2019t have homemade dairy-free almond milk for overnight oats, yogurt is fine! Yogurt is great! Yogurt makes me feel fantastic and who cares that it\u2019s technically dairy? If I eat plums poached in coffee and brandy and a little sugar, guess what? That\u2019s still more plums than I would have ever eaten otherwise.At some point during the week, I consciously bent my own rules to make dinner for a few friends who were leaving New York, and I cooked everything on the so-called \u201cforbidden\u201d list: braised lamb with eggplant and yogurt sauce; farro and carrot salad with apricots and whipped ricotta; Little Gems dressed with, essentially, savory whipped cream. I hardly felt guilt about any of it, though, because even though the gang (meat, gluten, dairy, and sugar) was all there, it was also one of the most nutritious and veg-heavy meals I\u2019ve prepared in months. A previous version of me would have called this a one-time thing, would have said I\u2019d get back on the bandwagon tomorrow. Me today is a bit more critical; me today wants to ask: Who said I can\u2019t eat this way whenever I damn please? Tomorrow, I\u2019ll eat rice bread and steam some vegetables\u2014but I might have them with a spoonful of leftover whipped ricotta. It\u2019s like the saying goes: Everything in moderation, including moderation.Hints of Fall:Photo by Chelsie Craig, food styling by Claire SaffitzSlow-Cooked Winter Squash with Sage and ThymeStir-Fried Eggplant with Basil and ChilesCreamy Pasta with Crispy MushroomsSteamed Kabocha With Ginger-Soy DressingApple-Walnut Upside-Down CakeGrape-Tarragon SpritzerExplore Bon App\u00e9titWhat's Chaey Cooking?cookingLifestyleRecipes you want to make.
