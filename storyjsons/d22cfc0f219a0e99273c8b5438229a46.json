Don\u2019t get me wrong: I\u2019ll slice some red onion and cover it with acid if a recipe tells me to. But I\u2019m not certainly not keeping things around in jars, and the truth is, I\u2019ve never felt the need to. Until now.I would like to swim in jars and jars and jars of Herby Garlic Confit, one of the many new recipes (if you can even call it a recipe) from our recent deep dive into garlic and all its stunning versatility. There\u2019s an elegant fish bathed in garlic-infused cream, a roast chicken with halves of garlic heads tucked into the baking dish, a pantry pasta studded with olives and smashed cloves. And while each of those called my name, it was the humble garlic confit that called it loudest of all.Ready for the oven.\nPhoto by Alex LauThe recipe requires only three ingredients\u2014garlic, olive oil, and a hearty herb like rosemary, thyme, and/or bay leaf\u2014and with gentle heat and time, together they create something deeply flavorful, extremely usable, and generally worth having around. After about an hour-and-a-half in the oven, I was left with tons of sweet, jammy cloves just waiting to be pushed out of their papery skins and\u2014bonus!\u2014the most gloriously infused garlic olive oil I have ever tasted.The only labor-intensive part of the process is pulling apart four whole heads, but to be honest it\u2019s not that labor-intensive because you don't even need to pull the cloves out of their skins. In fact, those skins act as a protective layer so that the insides become exceptionally soft, but when jarred, they don\u2019t squish and lose their shape. After separating, it\u2019s as simple as putting everything in a baking dish, covering it with foil, and letting it hang out in a low-temperature oven while the best smell in the world wafts through your home. After you jar the cloves, they\u2019ll last for about two weeks in the refrigerator, which is plenty of time to consume them all and the liquid gold that surrounds them.Up close and personal.\nPhoto by Alex LauI, for one, ate a large majority of the cloves smeared on fat pieces of toast. I also squeezed out a few to slather on a rotisserie chicken I picked up at the grocery store. But the possibilities abound. Try mashing them into store-bought mayo for an even better sandwich or as dip for crudite. Or stir them into mashed potatoes. As for the garlicky oil, you can use it as a marinade for olives and feta for an impressive party appetizer\u2014if you\u2019re the kind of person who likes to serve an impressive party appetizer. Or you can do what I did and use it to fry up some crispy chickpeas to eat all by yourself. If somehow you've managed to leave any juice left at the bottom of the jar, whisk it into a salad dressing for the best of your life.After that, if you're smart, you'll quickly proceed to make another batch.Get the recipe:Herby Garlic ConfitSpread it on grilled bread, mash it into store-bought mayo, or stir into mashed potatoes.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titGarlicCondiment/SpreadRecipes you want to make.
