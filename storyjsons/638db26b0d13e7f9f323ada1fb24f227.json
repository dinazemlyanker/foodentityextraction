Well, maybe it is, but we haven\u2019t found a way into a career path that allows us to sit around and give a thumbs up or a thumbs down to cakes all day. Yet. We mean cake testers, the little stick-like kitchen tools that are used to test the doneness of cakes.Cake testers are long, thin metal pins with small plastic handles, used to poke cakes to test interior doneness. And while we definitely encourage using a cake tester for its official, obvious use, there\u2019s a lot of other things you can use a cake tester for. Professional chefs use them to test proteins and vegetables just as often as they do cakes, and there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t adopt this technique at home. They only cost five bucks.Our favorite non-cake application for the cake tester is fish. Since fish is so soft and (generally) thin, using a meat thermometer to test internal temperature destroys your beautiful filet. Instead, we like to insert a cake tester into the thickest part of the fish and leave it there for three seconds. Immediately after removing the cake tester, touch the tip to the skin under your bottom lip for three seconds. If the metal is warm, the fish is done. If it\u2019s hot, the fish is probably overcooked, and if the metal is still cool, keep that fella cooking.Meaty proteins can be tested this way too, although we still prefer a meat thermometer. The substantial protein can stand up to a larger puncture and the results will be more precise.Crispy-skinned salmon is great, as long as it's cooked through.\nMichael Graydon & Nikole HerriottWe also love to test the doneness of potatoes, and the process is a little bit simpler. We\u2019re looking for a soft texture to tell if a potato has been cooked through, and while forks or knives work, they ultimately end up ruining the presentation of the potato with slits or holes. The slenderness of a cake tester allows it to puncture the potato, test the interior texture, and get the hell out, undetected.Sure, this seems like a primitive, imprecise technique. That\u2019s because it is. But just because something is primitive doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t work. The most impressive fish you\u2019ve had in restaurants were most likely tested this way, and bringing it home will take you one step closer to that crispy-skinned, perfectly-flaky filet you paid a bit too much for at dinner last week.Cake tester as a job? That would be amazing. Cake tester as a cheap instrument that guarantees the doneness of fish? That\u2019s good too. And maybe a touch more realistic.Buy It Now: OXO Cake Tester, $5 at amazon.comNow, it's time to get that cake tester to work:Slow-Roasted Salmon with Fennel, Citrus, and ChilesDon\u2019t bother trying to divide this fillet into tidy portions.
