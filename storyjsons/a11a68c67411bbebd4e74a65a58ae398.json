The other advantage? With risotto, you get to work through your feelings for 45 minutes, and then eat them too.Carla loves this classic Italian dish for that reason, but also because when it\u2019s executed perfectly, it\u2019s one of the creamiest, richest, most texturally pleasing dishes you can serve. But the truth is, so often, it\u2019s just not.So Carla set out to give us BA\u2019s Best Risotto: the fail-proof, gold standard recipe that gets risotto down to its very essence. Something you can serve in all its simple, naked glory. Something that doesn\u2019t need to hide behind additional ingredients, but can make a great canvas for them (more on that later). It\u2019s creamy, it\u2019s Parmy, it\u2019s satisfying, and it\u2019s definitely more al dente than you\u2019re likely used to having it. How did she get it there though? Allow me to break it down for you.You could say that not rinsing your rice is an essential step. And it is. You could say that finely chopping the onions is important. You wouldn\u2019t be wrong. You could say that timing is crucial, and that you should serve your risotto as soon as it\u2019s finished, hot and straight from the pot. That\u2019s all true too. But if you really get down to it, there are really only three (3) key factors to creating the tastiest risotto.First, choose the right rice. Our favorite risotto rice is carnaroli, referred to by the Italians as \u201cthe king of rice.\u201d It belongs to the family of short-grain Japanese rice, and the grains are plump, firm, and very starchy. That starch is what creates risotto\u2019s creamy texture\u2014mmmm. If you can\u2019t find carnaroli, Arborio or sushi rice will do. They\u2019re part of the family, and got some similar characteristics.Second, toast it. For toothsome risotto, you cannot skip this step. Before your rice comes into contact with any water, you cook the outer hull with your fine chopped onions and warmed olive oil. The hull will harden up as a result, ensuring that the grains cook evenly all the way through (otherwise, the outside will cook faster than the inside). It should take about five minutes to firm up the rice, but it\u2019s important to use your senses too: The grains will take on a slightly translucent color and they\u2019ll start to make a clattering noise against the sides of Dutch oven\u2014like tiny icicles hitting a window, hard and glassy. Carla warns that if you don\u2019t put in the five minutes to properly coat your rice, you\u2019ll have grains with a mushy exterior and gritty interior that stick to your molars as you chew. No one wants that.Third, use water, not stock. Many risotto recipes will list stock as the cooking liquid, but Carla decided against it for this recipe. That\u2019s because stock varies in flavor, seasoning, consistency, and quality. She prefers using 10 cups of plain old water brought to a gentle simmer with with 1 tablespoon of salt\u2014a trick she picked from chef Naomi Pomeroy. It\u2019s important that the water isn\u2019t room temperature but it also shouldn\u2019t be boiling when you add it to the pot. You\u2019re aiming to match the rice\u2019s temperature, since any sudden change will shock the grain and affect its texture.The rest is just stirring\u2014the therapy part. So get your glass of water or wine or beer. Put on your playlist or podcast. Get your comfy shoes on. Definitely go to the bathroom. And then settle in. Because once you start cooking, you will not have a moment to step away from the oven. This is an involved process. It\u2019s work, but it\u2019s also cathartic. Truly great risotto requires your absolute attention. And Carla guarantees it\u2019s worth it. And so can we.Oh, one last thing: Remember when we mentioned \u201cadditional ingredients\u201d? Carla also developed a few seasonal toppings that you can add to your perfect Parmigiano. Consider it your new way of keeping track of time.Spring: Minty Snap PeasWelcome some bright, light sweetness to shoulder season. Snap peas provide a crisp contrast to the creamy risotto, while mint brings the flavor to an even greener, more refreshing place.Summer: Garlicky Cherry TomatoesFresh cherry tomatoes cooked in garlic and chile flakes balance the risotto\u2019s richness with a sweet and spicy burst of flavor.Fall: Pan-Roasted ShroomsSome say fall smells like damp leaves, and others say it tastes like umami. Either way, it definitely smells like mushrooms. We liked them crisped and tossed with some red wine vinegar for an added tang.Winter: Lemon and ChiveThe winter pick-me-up you want during root vegetable season. Here, you\u2019re stirring lemon juice right into the risotto, and then topping it with zest, chives, olive oil, salt, and pepper.Get the recipeBA\u2019s Best RisottoRisotto is like a clingy baby.
