It\u2019s important to buy pearl barley for this recipe: Compared to whole grain hulled barley, which is chewy and requires lots of cooking liquid, the pearl barley used here cooks in less time and results in a creamier texture (think arborio rice). Another quick-cooking grain like pearled farro would also work well here. Making Hall\u2019s Fennel Potlikker is a crucial first step here, so be sure to read through that recipe first.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Taste your broth before adding any more in the barley simmering portion of the recipe.  1 tablespoon seems like a typo, a teaspoon, tops. I had to scoop out the salty broth, water it down, and re-add it.  Amy EEncinitas CA3/22/2022This is a spectacular dish. Cooking the barley in the potlikker is an enormous burst of flavor. Next time I make it I'll try cutting the amount of potlikker in half (if only to save more of it for other dishes). I have enough left in the freezer for the companion shrimp recipe. Look forward to making that. I learned a great deal from making this. Highly recommendRod ParkerBaton Rouge, LA3/16/2022I loved this recipe!  Very fresh and flavorful and healthful, and VEGAN even though not specified as such.  I made it exactly as written except that I added some fresh dill since it needed to be used up.  I think it would also be very adaptable.  I will try using farro next time for some extra fiber.  I think zucchini might fit in here when my garden is overflowing with it in the summer, and I bet it would be great as a cold salad with some cucumber and feta added.  I will be making this often!ShannonMadison, VA3/1/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titDinnerVegetarianVeganNut-FreeDairy-FreeRice and Grain BowlBarleyRice & GrainsMintHerbs & SpicesPeaVegetableAsparagusSideMainSpringRecipes you want to make.
