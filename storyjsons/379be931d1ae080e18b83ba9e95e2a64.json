Life can be hard\u2014and nobody\u2019s going to greet you with the medal you deserve for making it on time and with your shirt on right-side-out.But we, as humans, still need rewards. It\u2019s important to celebrate all of our successes, whether that\u2019s drawing a huge crowd for a performance or simply drawing on the perfect eyebrow. Rewards reinforce good behavior and combat burn-out by incentivizing good habits\u2014it turns out you can bribe yourself into doing a better job at life.The rewards don\u2019t need to be any grand gesture\u2014you don\u2019t want to do anything that blows you off track, like a shopping spree to celebrate your excellent budgeting. It can be as simple as doing something to put a smile on your face without disjointing your day. Nothing expensive, nothing fancy: simply a routine of rewards you create just for always being awesome. Here\u2019s how:Start by watching a funny video: Cue up the trailer for that new comedy everybody\u2019s been talking about, cue up this hilarious clip of comedian, Iliza Shlesinger, facing off against a hotel door, or just re-watch that viral video of one dog hiding under another dog a thousand more times. Laughter is the best medicine but it\u2019s also the best reward for the same reasons: it relieves stress, stimulates your organs, and improves your mood.If you\u2019re looking for something a little stronger, have a drink. No, we\u2019re not suggesting you crack a beer at work, but it\u2019s totally acceptable to grab a Peet\u2019s Iced Espresso and let the rich, creamy drink wake you up\u2014and cheer you up. It\u2019s made with carefully sourced ingredients, including single-origin dark roast Colombian espresso, pure cane sugar, and hormone-free milk and with less sugar than competitors and no artificial colors or flavors. It\u2019s the kind of easy reward you can drink every day, and you'll find it at most convenience and grocery stores in a right-sized eight-ounce can, perfect for telling yourself, \u201cCongratulations on making it through another morning.\u201dFor those particularly hectic days, you can reward yourself by simply doing nothing. Give yourself the gift of zero activity (physical or brain) for 5 minutes without guilt. Grab a seat in the sunshine or just pop on your noise-cancelling headphones at your desk, and let your mind drift away from what\u2019s next at work, family obligations, and your never-ending to-do list. Let it wander only into vacations, flower fields, and exciting weekend plans; create the space for all the happy thoughts that you usually push aside\u2014consider it a thank you for all the thinking your brain has done today.Get a little help in pushing the real world away for a second by spritzing yourself. Good smells and moisturized skin are two things that make everybody happy, and facial sprays will perk up your nose and your skin. Even if you don\u2019t have time for the other quick options here, it only takes a few seconds to use these. A little four-ounce bottle will slip right into a purse or desk drawer, and they come in a variety of aromas that you can tailor to your needs\u2014lavender is known to be stress reducing, while peppermint can cheer you up. And on top of the instant refresh for your skin and mood, you can also feel good about staying moisturized.Life is hard, especially when no one else gives you the praise and compensation you deserve. But there\u2019s no need to save that reward for a special day\u2014after all, you made it out of bed today, you deserve a prize.Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
