Seabiscuit? Black Beauty? Any movie with horses in it? If you answered yes, you will be familiar with the concept of \"horse carrots.\" There\u2019s always a scene where the stablehand or trainer or whoever takes a huge carrot and feeds it to a horse. A truly massive, audibly crunchy carrot, appropriately sized for a horse. That is a horse carrot.Human beings eat horse carrots too. You can buy them at almost any grocery store. They\u2019re usually sold loose, by the pound, in a big bin. You might walk by and pick one up and say something like, Wow, this is a large carrot! You probably know what I\u2019m talking about. And it can be tempting to buy these monstrous carrots\u2014it definitely seems efficient. You only have to peel one carrot instead of four! They're easier to butcher! But here\u2019s the thing: You should always avoid the big carrots and opt for the smaller ones instead.When it comes to vegetables, bigger is almost never better, and this is particularly true with carrots. Those horse carrots have higher starch levels, more water, less flavor, and minimal natural sweetness. They are a shade of what a carrot should be. They\u2019re more impressive when it comes to size, but when it comes to flavor, you\u2019re getting almost nothing.And we use that natural sweetness for establishing a base flavor in a wide variety of dishes. If we\u2019re using carrots in a mirepoix (that combination of chopped vegetables that chefs sweat out to start soups and the like), we\u2019re expecting them to do the heavy lifting in the sugars department. You won\u2019t get that base layer of flavor if you use a horse carrot. You\u2019re really just adding moisture and starch. And if carrots are the star of the dish, well, you get the picture.The smaller the carrots, the bigger the flavor.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Dana BonaguraSo what kind of carrots should you buy? If you\u2019re the intuitive type, you\u2019d say, The smaller ones! And you\u2019d be right. To be clear, I\u2019m not talking about bagged baby carrots. You shouldn\u2019t buy those either. I\u2019m talking about the reasonably-sized, slender carrots that usually come in a bunch, sometimes with the green tops still attached. These carrots tend to be sweeter, with a more concentrated carrot flavor. Whether you\u2019re using them in soup, baking them into a cake, roasting them to eat as a side, or just snacking on them with a little yogurt dip.We should all be riding the small carrot wave. It\u2019s going to make your food taste better, and that will make you happier. I\u2019m just looking out for your happiness. And the horses! They need carrots too. Leave the horse carrots for the horses. That's how things should be.Yup, you should use small carrots in cake too:Basically Carrot Loaf CakeThe most casual-cool carrot cake of all time.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyCarrotRecipes you want to make.
