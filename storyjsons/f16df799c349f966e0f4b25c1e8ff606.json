In an opening scene, a server from a street caf\u00e9 scales five flights upstairs to the Dispatch offices to deliver a tray full of aperitifs, absinthe, dry white wine, a cola, and an affogato to the editors\u2019 planning meeting. (If you\u2019re wondering why the caf\u00e9 server is delivering drinks directly to them, there isn\u2019t really a reason. Like the wine bottle\u2019s label literally reading \u201cVin Blanc Sec,\u201d it\u2019s typical Wes Anderson quirkiness.)The film follows the staffers of the Dispatch through a series of flashbacks as they discuss stories they\u2019ve written about their time in the fictional French town of Ennui-sur-Blas\u00e9. In all but the final story, the characters barely eat or even look at food. But they sure drink like fish, and these libations fill some of the film\u2019s most fun and beautiful scenes. It\u2019s a deeply rewarding watch for aesthetes with a penchant for glassware and great storytelling. Here are three scenes where the drinks steal the show.The Champagne jailbreakA carefully orchestrated party is undone by...Champagne. Incarcerated artist Moses Rosenthaler (Benicio Del Toro) debuts his newest and most ambitious work at a party held in one of his prison\u2019s rooms. A string trio, caterers, and art collectors, dealers, and brokers from around the world all sneak into the prison just for the party. There, they down Champagne (but no food; it\u2019s an art world party, after all). When the artist\u2019s broker, Julian Cadazio (Adrien Brody), realizes the invaluable fresco, painted directly onto the walls of the prison building, can\u2019t actually be sold to anyone, he angrily throws Champagne at Rosenthaler\u2019s painting. The two start fighting as would-be buyers look on. Then dozens of prisoners who have been denied bribes to keep said party secret storm the scene. Champagne bottles fly, delicate crystal coupes shatter to the floor, mayhem ensues, and, honestly, it\u2019s one of the most fun and carefree moments in the movie. Would it be as funny if carafes of water and plastic cups stood in for the bottles of booze and coupe glasses? Probably not! The theatricality and excess are what make the scene.Photography courtesy of Searchlight PicturesThe revolution will be hydratedDisaffected student protestors gather and debate in the Cafe Sans Blague. The caf\u00e9 is described by one writer (named, of all things, Herbsaint Sazerac and played by Owen Wilson) as a neighborhood hangout where \u201chungry, restless, and reckless\u201d students gather. For students described as hungry\u2014at least in the abstract sense\u2014it\u2019s funny that we never see them actually eat there. Instead, the caf\u00e9 is nearly bursting with students debating over drinks. Boys try to one-up each others\u2019 arguments over coffees, and beers that look warm and flat sit in front of girls who are more captivated by the debates taking place around them. A cola rests by a teetotaler who sits quietly while taking in the scene. A carafe of white wine on a table gathers condensation. It\u2019s these drinks that bring the students together and empower them to express their shared discontent (with Ennui's local government, their university, adults in general\u2014the usual things that aggravate newly disillusioned youth the most).The amber Easter eggAn easily missed shot of the walls in the Cafe Sans Blague rewards eagle-eyed viewers with some insight on all the sips throughout the film: Posters advertise the yellow-orange aperitif from the opening office scene as \u201cAmbre Aperitif\u201d\u2014amber aperitif, thanks, Anderson; a Chablis that\u2019s shown on other posters all over Ennui; and absinthe that we see poured into the same kind of thimble-size etched crystal glass for different characters at different times. It\u2019s sheer aesthetic delight for detail-oriented design obsessives. And the abundance of drinks feels like a cheeky nod to Parisian dietary tropes (our creatives quite literally live in Ennui, barely eat, and seem to subsist on coffee and wine).But as new characters, storylines, and settings appear and, at times, overwhelm, these drinks-as-signposts provide a comforting sense of connection to the material you may have forgotten or overlooked. Critics have noted that Anderson\u2019s films mix references and symbolism in a way that re-creates the experience of reading a story. Discovering these Easter eggs feels a lot like the joy of resurfacing a seemingly unremarkable phrase from the first few chapters of a novel as disparate parts of the plot come together in its final pages. In the same way I reread my most beloved books, I look forward to revisiting The French Dispatch\u2014aperitif in hand.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCultureMoviesRecipes you want to make.
