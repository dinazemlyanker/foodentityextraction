Maple syrup! Pickled celery in Bloody Mary brine! Boucherie Lawrence started off as a way to offer customers of its sister restaurants (Lawrence, Larrys) access to all the fantastic meats, sausages, breads, and more on the menus. It\u2019s become a beloved butcher shop with highly knowledgeable staff.ORDER: whichever sausage sandwich is on the chalkboard! It will likely come with something pickle-y and slathered in something creamy, and it will not disappoint. Then grab a bunch of different uncooked sausages to take with you for breakfast at your Airbnb.THE VIBE IS: Hip modern butcher shop with a nod toward the small quaint boucheries of yesteryear that once dominated this neighborhood. The space is part butcher counter, part sandwich shop, part grocer, so there\u2019s plenty to explore.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Tuesday to Friday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Closed Monday, so plan ahead.\u2014Molly BazWE ALSO LOVELarrysA natural wine bar that also serves the best breakfast in Mile EndSt-Viateur Bagel ShopSettle the great bagel debate by getting a dozen at the famed Mile End mini chainCaf\u00e9 OlimpicoGet your caffeine fix at this Mile End espresso shopExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
