Here it\u2019s used twice: First by seasoning the fish before cooking, then sprinkled over right after to balance the sweet and herby tamarind sauce and cilantro chutney. That\u2019s what you do with chaat, the category of Indian snacks that rely on this spice mix\u2014it\u2019s the perfect final touch. We love Spicewalla\u2019s Chaat Masala; a single shake gives any dish a distinct salty and tangy flavor.Ingredients4 servingsChutney1bunch cilantro, tough stems trimmed, coarsely chopped (about 2 cups)2green Thai chiles or other green chiles, seeds removed if desired1garlic clove, smashed2Tbsp. fresh lemon juiceKosher saltTamarind sauce2Tbsp. tamarind concentrate1Tbsp.

Working one at a time, dip flesh side of fillets in spiced oil to coat, then transfer to a cold large skillet, arranging skin side down.

Used it for fresh snapper caught in Florida and would highly recommend. Bright, colorful dish that visually impressed and tasted great. I had to make a few substitutions and it worked fine. Used the juice of an orange and a lime instead of tamarind paste. Also, used curry powder instead of chaat. I know those are the two main ingredients, but it\u2019s what was available to me. I had a little bit of a hard time getting the skin crispy.Andy ChallChicago, IL2/12/2022Being bi racial I commend Andy on using such a delicious spice on fish I use it on fruits and stuff like potato chicpeas etcGillianCanada4/20/2021Fried garlic/ginger/chaat masala smells amazing and might honestly be the best thing I\u2019ve ever smelled. The amchur and black salt give it an amazingly fruity quality. I found chaat masala at a local Indian market. MDH is a good brand. I tried this recipe with snapper, and the color of the fish was beautiful, although you have to handle it delicately on the stove. I also tried making with salmon (easier to find) and it was equally good.
