Do you ever do the weeknight dinner-party thing?More than cooking, it\u2019s a scramble. Can one of you cut out early from the office, who\u2019s going to do what, what kind of dishes can you manage to pull off in a short amount of time?I had gotten inspired to riff on some sort of Mediterranean-slash-Middle Eastern menu. There would be quickly marinated, grilled lamb chops (a fast-cooking protein is always a good move). I stopped by the market and picked up some Japanese eggplant (you know, the long, skinny ones), that I would throw on the grill before the chops. And Simone tossed together a basic green salad with her famous (at least in our household) shallot vinaigrette.Peden & MunkWant this letter before it hits the website?

Now, if you want, you could log on to bonappetit.com and find two no-fail homemade hummus recipes, one from celebrated Philadelphia chef Michael Solomonov, and one from Sam Smith, chef at the always-packed Tusk in Portland, Oregon.But you know what I\u2019m not making on a weeknight? Hummus\u2014no matter how defyingly airy and creamy it may be.Alex LauAnd that\u2019s the thing about entertaining: you don\u2019t need to make everything from scratch. But you should do something to zhuzh up whatever store-bought items you\u2019re setting out.I picked up a tub of hummus from Dizengoff, Solomonov\u2019s hummus in nearby Chelsea Market. And then I did like the pros\u2014I spooned a blob of the chickpea-and-tahini spread into a shallow bowl, and I took the back of a soup spoon, set it into the hummus, and began to rotate the bowl like a spinning LP. Gradually, grooves started to form, along with a ridged border.Can\u2019t exactly picture what I mean? Check out the minute-long technique video on the hummus swoosh for a tutorial below, just like I did before our friends came over.Once I had formed my hummus sculpture, I filled the wells with extra virgin olive oil, and hit it with a few pinches of Aleppo pepper. Had I thought about it, I could\u2019ve topped it with a chiffonade of crisp sugar snap peas, or maybe some sweet, wilted, oven-roasted cherry tomatoes, or pretty much anything.I threw some pita on the grill \u2018til it was warm and puffy, and cut it into little triangles. And there we were, hanging out at our backyard picnic table, scooping up hummus with warm pita and the occasional cucumber spear, and refilling our tumblers with icy cold ros\u00e9.It was kinda perfect. Who cares if we didn\u2019t actually make it?Get the recipes:Grilled Lamb Chops Scottadito with Charred Cherry TomatoesSimone\u2019s Shallot VinaigretteDizengoff\u2019s HummusTusk\u2019s HummusGrilled Eggplant and Lemons with Garlic LabnehExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterHummusRecipes you want to make.
