Johnson\u2019s AfropotIt\u2019s an entire seafood boil in miniature and I\u2019ll share it\u2014if I must.By Alex BeggsMay 16, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Bea da CostaFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.There are plenty of places in New York to get a pot of mussels in some white wine whatever broth and a side of fries. There aren\u2019t nearly enough places to get a pot that overfloweth with so much seafood it\u2019s nearly jumping out of the broth trying to get back to where it came from. At Henry at Life Hotel, the Afropot is such a thing.It comes to the table in a wide serving bowl with bright red King Crab Legs mid-showgirl kick. It\u2019s 3.5 pounds of whatever seafood is in season\u2014lobster, crab, mussels, clams, giant prawns with their beady little eyes. Your hands get messy, things get grabby, that\u2019s the whole point. It\u2019s an entire seafood boil in miniature, with spicy coins of Chinese sausage and a fragrant, chuggable, mustard-colored broth.And oh the brothhhhhhhh. It steams and spreads its perfume, and makes everyone around the table scoot closer and start snatching legs and shells and prawn whiskers. The flavor is seafood forward, shrimp and lobster-y, backed up my fragrant lemongrass, ginger, garlic, and bird\u2019s eye chili (the real stuff from West Africa, per chef J.J. Johnson), and perfectly balanced.\u201cEverybody is oohing and ahhing,\u201d Johnson says about diners\u2019 reactions to the pot\u2014that would be me, when sharing it with two other friends recently. \u201cPeople might think of a clambake, a seafood boil in the south, someone from Nigeria or Senegal can taste that dried seafood flavor and it brings them back home.\u201d For Johnson, the dish was inspired by a fish broth he drank at the Ghana fish market every morning before he went shopping.And while the menu at Henry changes each season, Johnson makes a promise: \u201cThat dish isn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d I promise right back that I\u2019ll keep coming for it.Go there: Henry at Life HotelP.S.
