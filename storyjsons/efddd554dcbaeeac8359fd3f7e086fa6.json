(They put MSG in mayo! Respect.) The mottled, miso-hued liquid initially looked sugary-sweet\u2014like something from Newman\u2019s Own\u2014but where was the flaccid plastic bottle I love-hate?! This one came in glass, and it called to me from the shelves of the Japanese supermarket I was in. Seeing \u201cKewpie\u201d in all caps on the label was all I needed to gingerly plop it into my shopping basket. It was a guarantee of delicious things ahead, an invitation into the Kewpie lifestyle.Now, several months into living that #Kewpielife, I have a minimum of two bottles in the fridge at all times.It is nectar of the umami gods. It\u2019s super savory, thanks to soy sauce and sesame seeds (and, surprisingly, no MSG), balanced with zingy vinegar and brown sugar. But my favorite thing about this salad dressing is that it\u2019s got body. It\u2019s not one of those thin, salty, mouth-puckering vinaigrettes; it\u2019s cloudlike and creamy like toum. It makes eating my vegetables feel less virtuous and more indulgent.A generous drizzle of this sweet-savory liquid gold gets me out of my lunch rut, perking up soggy leftover lentils and my thousandth serving of roasted broccoli. This dressing has replaced ranch for all my raw veg needs (healthier snacks!) and will make its debut at picnics in the park very soon. More often than not my husband will bring out the bottle for whatever we\u2019re eating, from pan-seared salmon to mille-feuille nabe.At BA, we tend to gravitate toward hyperbole when we talk about things we like, but that\u2019s the only way to talk about this sesame dressing. On the Kewpie site there are 2,458 (and counting) glowing reviews. Some have compared this salad dressing to The Empire Strikes Back (\u201cyou can't imagine life without it\u201d). Some reviewers are actually just desperate customers looking for a fix because their Costco stopped selling giant jugs of it (to which I want to respond, \u201cYou can buy it right here, on Amazon.\u201d).There\u2019s just something about this tangy-sweet, sesame-seed-flecked dressing that thousands of us can\u2019t shake off. It brings a little joy wherever it goes, and you notice it when it\u2019s gone, which it never will be in my house, because of my aforementioned two-bottle rule.In the meantime I\u2019ll keep scouring the shelves of my Japanese supermarket, looking for the next Kewpie condiment to add to my collection.Photo by Emma FishmanKewpie Deep-Roasted Sesame Dressing$17 at Amazon (Pack of 2)Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make.
