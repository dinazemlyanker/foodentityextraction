Next up is Jessica Dore, a tarot card reader and social worker currently writing a book reflecting on tarot through the lens of behavioral science and psychology.Jessica Dore doesn\u2019t have the answers. When she pulls daily tarot cards for her 132,000-plus Twitter followers or 50,000-plus Instagram followers, Dore does not forecast the future or make predictions. Instead, the social worker turned tarot reader uses the cards to give her audience daily, thought-provoking mental health advice.As a tarot reader and Big Fan of therapy myself\u2014seriously, I can\u2019t shut up about it\u2014I was floored the first time I interacted with Dore\u2019s work. I don\u2019t ascribe to tarot\u2019s reputation as a divination tool, but over the past decade or so, I\u2019ve found real value in the cards as a medium for self-reflection and understanding. Dore\u2019s daily readings echo my own practice, while also distilling teachings of compassion, empathy, avoidance, obsession, and more into 280-character nuggets of wisdom. But she doesn't shy away from the harder truths, either. \u201cOur inability to understand reality beyond pairs of opposites (this/that, good/bad) leaves us boxed into a flat & monotone shadow box life,\u201d she wrote recently about the Seven of Cups, which depicts jewels, a castle, and a laurel wreath floating in a cloud.Like many, I\u2019m all but drowning from near-constant anxiety and information overload. Dore (who holds a masters degree in social work and is a former publicist for New Harbinger, a publisher of clinical psychology literature targeting therapy pros) provides a modicum of comfort. When I find myself doomscrolling, her posts of brightly colored cards from the classic Rider-Waite deck stop me in my tracks.One particular reading about the Nine of Swords\u2014a card often associated with fear and despair that depicts a person in bed, face in hands\u2014stood out when I was particularly anxious. \u201cSometimes feelings are so laden with judgments & evaluations that we lose contact w/ what\u2019s at the heart of our experience,\u201d Dore posted. \u201cFeeling rejected, attacked, uncared for, all are valid. But these feelings also contain assumptions about reality that we may want to explore.\u201d Succinct and universal, she touches on subtle but deep truths about anxiety and depression, or rest and recovery, or any number of topics, seamlessly weaving together tarot\u2019s ancient archetypes with modern therapy.Curious about her tarot practice and self-care in a time of deep uncertainty, I called up Dore to talk about how her routines ground her, how tarot helps her make sense of the world, and how she almost ended up as a bread baker.Many of the things I talk about in my tarot practice...manifested in my own life via my relationship with food. I had an eating disorder for a long time, and that\u2019s probably my biggest mental health challenge. A big part of my interest in psychology and understanding obsession, compulsion, anxiety, dysmorphia, control and avoidance stems from it. I\u2019ve been in recovery for several years, but when I started doing a daily yoga practice almost 10 years ago, my practice was so rigorous, it kept me hungry. I had to eat to sustain that practice. I need routine, and yoga helped me develop regular mealtimes.Before I went to grad school...I thought I wanted to be a bread baker. I considered going to culinary school, and I even worked at a bakery here in Philly. I only worked there for two weeks\u2014I couldn\u2019t handle the manual labor\u2014so I have so much respect for professional bakers. But at home, I\u2019ve been getting back to baking bread, which reminds me of my Ashtanga yoga practice. I\u2019ve been performing the same postures for 10 years, but every day is different depending on the temperature in the room, my headspace, whether my body feels stronger or weaker depending on the day before. Bread is the same. You may have mastered it last week, but the conditions change and now it\u2019s a new world. Like recently, a friend and I were baking, and then it got too cold so we were putting the bowls of dough against our bellies in an attempt to warm them up\u2014you constantly have to attend to the present moment. You can\u2019t get caught up in the technique, like \u201cOh I did this one time so I\u2019ll always succeed at achieving a great crumb.\u201d Nope. Bread does not conform to you, you have to adapt to the bread and the conditions you\u2019re dealt with.Baking also reminds me of...the tarot journey. The Fool starts off not knowing anything about the World but by the end of the journey through the Major Arcana, they are this beautiful dancer, like you see in the classic Rider-Waite depiction. They are dancing between certainty and uncertainty, between so many binaries and polarities, like structure and chaos. When I\u2019m baking, I can know about recipes, measurements, and proper technique: structure. The chaos manifests as that day\u2019s conditions, like humidity, temperature, whether the oven is working. You have to find a way to move fluidly between the present moment and your understanding of structure.I love tarot because...the cards can give you a visual language to help your creative practice, whether that\u2019s yoga, breadmaking, or whatever art. It\u2019s all connected, in a way. From the beginning, while I was learning the meaning of these cards, I was also at this 40-hour-a-week job reading clinical psychology literature. I was absorbing a lot of visual metaphors from the cards and then seeing similar concepts and theories playing out in the studies trying to help people understand their behavior.When I\u2019m meeting with clients struggling to be fluid in the space between structure and chaos...I speak with them about what grounds them. I often hear \u201cI\u2019m confused, lost, unmoored,\u201d which is common and relatable, but I do think that there is so much rich material to learn in those spaces if we can quell that \u201cflight\u201d urge. Myths and folktales always start with someone finding themselves in a dark forest, or a cave, or out at sea. Everything they once used for navigation\u2014breadcrumbs, the night sky, their compass\u2014no longer works, but they eventually find their way back. That universal motif teaches me there is value in uncertainty. It\u2019s not something you have to rush out of. I don\u2019t do therapy. I read tarot cards and write about tarot cards for a public audience. I\u2019m not working with people in crisis. If I was a therapist and a patient was diagnosed bipolar, I would be working with them to get on a regular routine, a sleep schedule, those things are important for those people. Instead, I get to be a little bit more flexible, dance in those liminal spaces and explore different ideas.I\u2019m not here to convince someone that tarot...is not divination or satanic. I understand why people have those associations, but I have zero interest in engaging in conversation about it. You don\u2019t have to pick up tarot cards. It\u2019s fine. It can be esoteric and spiritual or it can be another tool for self-care and mental health work. I hear more and more that people are using tarot in clinical settings as a tool to gather insight, which is how I use it. So people can engage on that level while others can just play with a pack of cards.I challenge the idea...that anxiety is something that needs to be released. Instead, I\u2019ve learned to relate to it differently, thanks to the various therapies I\u2019ve studied over the years. Of course, you want it to go away, but what are you going to do if it doesn\u2019t? How are you going to live your life with it? Steven Hayes, who wrote Get Out of Your Mind and Into Your Life, developed a practice called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, which helps you recontextualize and accept your fears and worries even as you live a meaningful life in alignment with your values. If I was a fortune-telling tarot card reader with 100 percent accuracy and told you that the way you feel triggered by your family, or whatever problem you\u2019re dealing with is not going to change\u2014it\u2019s gonna be like that for life\u2014then what? The focus becomes less on trying to change something you can\u2019t to working on what you can. You still have that power.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSelf CareBreadPerson of InterestInterviewsRead MoreLifestyleAstrology Apps and Tarot Cards: My Pandemic Search for CertaintyBy MacKenzie Chung FeganRecipes you want to make.
