To my Teta and Baba, the logical flow of these arguments would inevitably help me succeed in life, but to me it seemed like little more than a ploy to get me to eat the zayt ou za\u2019atar on the breakfast table (and then go to medical school). Although za\u2019atar is such a staple in Arab regions that it\u2019s practically considered a food group, I seldom touched the dry herb mix my Teta made at home; even when doused in olive oil I could not help but feel like I was eating stale grass.Fast-forward to college in D.C., where I avoided both science courses and za\u2019atar\u2014against my Teta and Baba\u2019s wishes. That is, until I found Z&Z za\u2019atar at a local farmers market. The brand\u2019s particular blend of wild thyme, sumac, and sesame seeds was completely unlike the dry herb mix I ate throughout childhood. It was earthier, tangier, and nuttier\u2014thanks to the freshness of each ingredient and the touch of sunflower oil, which seemed to preserve and enhance the flavor of the herbs and seeds. Compared to my Teta\u2019s, which had a chalky mouthfeel and single-note flavor profile, Z&Z\u2019s za\u2019atar has a complexity and body I never knew a herb mix could have.Z&Z\u2019s za\u2019atar is harvested from various farms around Jenin in the West Bank of Palestine. The plant is called Origanum syriacum\u2014or, Syrian oregano\u2014which Z&Z refers to as wild thyme. In Arabic, the word za\u2019atar is used to describe a number of plants in the Lamiaceae family, like Syrian oregano, wild marjoram, wild thyme, and hyssop\u2014the latter of which makes appearances in ancient texts, like the Bible, and was lauded throughout Western Asia for its flavor and superfood properties (hence the old adage that za\u2019atar makes you smarter). Depending on the source, any of those herbs can be considered za'atar. This might be confusing because in the U.S., oregano is not the same thing as thyme, but it\u2019s a testament to how Middle Eastern food varies greatly from region to region.Z&Z is family-owned and operated by the Dubbaneh brothers, who have made it their mission to bring the cultural symbolism of za\u2019atar from the Middle East to the U.S. In the Arab world, za\u2019atar is present at almost every meal and most often enjoyed with warm bread and olive oil (like man\u2019oushe, which is a round flatbread covered in za\u2019atar and typically topped with cucumbers, tomatoes, and mint). With no exaggeration, I sprinkle this za\u2019atar on practically everything; eggs, chicken, mezze dips, popcorn, and, when I\u2019m feeling especially millennial, avocado toast. Sometimes I even eat it by the spoonful right out of the jar. (My IQ must be off the charts by now!)Although I wasn\u2019t a particular fan of my Teta\u2019s za\u2019atar growing up, tasting Z&Z\u2019s in my first year at college brought back those memories of breakfast with my family and instantly made me feel at home. Eating za\u2019atar and sharing it with my peers was\u2014and still is\u2014a way to make me feel connected and proud of my Middle Eastern roots. So, while I may not be a doctor like my grandparents had hoped, their za\u2019atar wish did come true.Photo by Isa Zapata, food styling by Micah MortonZ&Z Za'atar$11 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendSeasoningRecipes you want to make.
