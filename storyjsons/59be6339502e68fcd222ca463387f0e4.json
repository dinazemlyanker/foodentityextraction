When something's so easy to make that you don't even need one. Welcome to It's That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.There are good friends, and then there are friends who give you soup. Soup friends are besties with the wisdom of babcis (Polish grandmothers)\u2014they know that no matter what\u2019s troubling you, a nice bowl of soup will make everything better. And it's a bonus when that soup also happens to be their babci's recipe.My friend Holly gifted me a jar of her famous Polish pickle soup, a recipe handed down by her grandma Helen. Rich, porky broth electroshocked with garlicky brine, it was a revelation, a study in contrasts with mouthfuls of shredded Polish dills melting into creamy pearl barley with a satisfying bite. The puckery zing of the pickles brought what might otherwise be a stodgy soup to life and got me thinking about the strong tradition of sour soups in Eastern European cuisine.My Polish grandma used to make a cabbage soup called kapusta that filled the house with heady funk and was tangy with fresh sauerkraut and earthy with the musk of borowik, dried boletus mushrooms. The complex sweet-sour-salty broth of pink borscht is traditionally built on kvass, a base of fermented beets. The white version is made by fermenting the crusts of rye bread. In the spring, my family would pick sorrel, eating handfuls of the citrusy leaves raw before whizzing the rest of our haul into a neon green tonic. These soups are as much a lesson in thrift, turning nothing\u2014some picked-over bones, veggie scraps, stale bread\u2014into something, as they are in balance. As it turns out, many other recipes in the soup season repertoire can benefit from a pickleback.To follow in the tradition of our babcis and experiment with briny, tangy, sour soups yourself, start by substituting between \u215b and \u00bc of the liquid in your soup base with pickle juice. Brines can pack a salty punch; taste yours first and proceed cautiously. You can always add more. Or, if you\u2019d prefer a more subtle approach, try tossing in a handful or two of chopped or shredded pickles instead, for little bursts of brightness. But if you\u2019re like me and have vinegar running through your veins, go big and add both!Traditionalists might recoil in horror, but why not add a few splashes of pickle juice to a nice, steaming bowl of matzo ball soup, doubling down on the big dill energy. Chopped gherkins would bring some welcome zest to anything with rich, umami depth, like a hearty mushroom soup. And there\u2019s no need to stick to dill\u2014consider adding a splash of japle\u00f1o pickle brine to add just a touch of mild heat to brothy, light tomato soups, or Italian giardiniera-style pickles to pasta-loaded meatball soups, or even slightly sweet bread-and-butter brine to summery gazpacho to inch it towards a Bloody Mary. Just stay away from any soups with dairy to avoid a curdled disappointment.Techniques like this never seem to get written down. They\u2019re passed along as one generation stands next to another at the stove. Their origins are debated with family members, the ingredients discerned through the power of taste memories. And sometimes, soup is simply placed in our hands by those who love us with no further explanation needed. For any soup recipe that needs a punch of zippy brightness to wake it up, turn to pickles\u2014then share a bowl with others to join the ranks of the esteemed soup friend.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimplecookingRecipes you want to make.
