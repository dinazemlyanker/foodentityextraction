She\u2019s carrying a very large pot of tomato gravy. The warning goes up like an emergency flare to her fellow chefs crammed in one of New York City\u2019s most hallowed (and most claustrophobic) kitchens: the James Beard House.The chefs squish closer to their stations to give Rock room. \u201cThis calms me down,\u201d she says to me as she wipes tomato gravy puddles from the countertop. \u201cClose proximity, I\u2019m used to. The stressful part was making sure that everyone got here.\u201dThat\u2019s because tonight is the graduation ceremony for Rock and the group of sous-chefs, high school culinary teachers, and chef de cuisines gathered together in this kitchen. Just the day before, they all drove up from Kentucky in small sedans packed with boxes of prepped ingredients for the climactic moment ending their time as the first round of mentees under the LEE Initiative.Rock's take on pork and beans for the James Beard House dinner\nDavid Chow / Courtesy of the James Beard Foundation\u201cHow do you respond to the #MeToo movement in a way that\u2019s more than a reactionary thing?\u201d Edward Lee poses to me over the phone, about a week before the dinner.After news of sexual harassment allegations against Mario Batali, John Besh, and Ken Friedman about a year ago, Lee, the chef behind 610 Magnolia in Louisville, and 610\u2019s general manager, Lindsey Ofcacek, reflected on their own experiences working in restaurants. \u201cI have been in the industry my whole life, and I\u2019ve always believed there is more good than bad,\u201d Lee says. Part of that good, he recognized, were the female chefs leading beyond the kitchen.Their conversations led to the formation of the LEE Initiative, a week-long mentorship program that pairs five Kentucky-based cooks with a respected chef from restaurants around the country. The goal is to give rising local talents a chance to shadow a mentor and gain exposure to the industry from multiple angles\u2014from meetings with accountants to social media management to the leadership skills necessary to run a kitchen. Funds raised from sponsors (Maker\u2019s Mark) and private donors (including Lee) go toward paying for each mentee\u2019s time off from work. This year\u2019s applicant pool reached to 200 candidates. The winning five were paired with mentors Anne Quatrano of Star Provisions in Atlanta, Katie Button of C\u00farate in Asheville, Brooke Williamson of Hudson House in Redondo Beach, Sarah Grueneberg of Monteverde Restaurant & Pastificio in Chicago, and Jenn Louis of now-closed Ray in Portland, Oregon.\u201cWe wanted to do something smaller and quieter but something we thought could last for years and create change,\u201d Lee says. \u201cIt was really Lindsey\u2019s idea.\u201dOfcacek started her career as a line cook, then eventually moved to the front of the house as a general manager and sommelier. Even though she loved her job, Ofcacek thought this was only temporary\u2014she had two small children at that time and couldn\u2019t see how she could meet the demands of running a restaurant while also taking care of them. Then in Louisville, she was hired by chef Annie Pettry of Decca, where maternity leave, nursing in meetings, and strict sexual harassment policies are the norm. She realized she could make it work.When she joined the 610 team about a year and a half later, she brought with her practices passed on from Pettry: ask questions, take care of your staff as much as you do your guests, and don\u2019t be afraid to change the whole system if it\u2019s not working for everyone. Now she\u2019s extending these mantras to the LEE Initiative as executive director.\u201cI just thought about how there are lot of women on the bottom of management and not the top. That\u2019s because if you\u2019re treated like garbage during your first job in a restaurant, you\u2019ll leave,\u201d Ofcacek explains to me over the phone. \u201cWe wanted to be an incubator for more women to push through and stay in this industry.\u201dOfcacek and Lee with the first class of LEE Initiative mentees: Nikkia Rhodes, Stephanie Callihan, Rock, AuCo Lai, and Stephania Sharkey\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigBack at the Beard House, the mentees work together seamlessly. It\u2019s the first time they\u2019re cooking dinner as a team and, for some, it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve cooked in a kitchen without men. \u201cIt\u2019s quieter,\u201d one of the mentees mentions. \u201cLess competitive,\u201d another adds. Then Rock says what all the mentees are thinking: \u201cIt feels like a level playing field.\u201d\u201cI stumbled across the call for applicants on social media, and I remember thinking, \u2018Oh my gosh, this is me. My name is all over it,\u2019\u201d Rock tells me. \u201cThen in typical Jen Rock fashion, I waited until the very last moment to turn in my application to Lindsey.\u201dShe lets out a husky laugh. Rock is a petite woman, dressed in all black, with short, curly hair that seems to defy gravity, and Doc Martens on her feet. Her black, rectangular glasses continually slide down her nose, and she\u2019s mastered a kind of choreography to get them back in place without missing a beat.Rock got into cooking as a way to financially support different career paths she thought she might take\u2014theology school, HIV prevention non-profit work, etc. \u201cThere\u2019s always been a little activist inside of me,\u201d she says. But it wasn\u2019t until she started cooking privately for a family that she realized cooking could be a career. So, when she and her family decided to return to Louisville three years ago, Rock landed at Gralehaus, starting off as a part-time line cook/dishwasher and working her way up to chef de cuisine alongside chef Andy Myers\u2014a position she never dreamed of having.She detailed what happened next in her application to LEE Initiative: Mental illness changed her wife, and she became emotionally and physically abusive toward Rock. Then, her wife left her. Devastated, Rock sought out therapy at the Center for Women & Families in Louisville. She poured herself into her work.\u201cI lost my whole world, and I found myself a domestic violence survivor,\u201d Rock says. \u201cI could hardly get up for myself everyday, but, Gralehaus, that was the one good place. It just helped me pull myself up, get through it, and focus on something else.\u201dWhen she was paired with Jenn Louis for her LEE Initiative mentorship earlier this spring, she had no idea the two would connect over this issue. Louis has written about her own experience of surviving domestic abuse. From her, Rock honed her knife skills and learned how to better communicate with front-of-house staff. But the thing that\u2019s stayed with her the most was how Louis was able to lead in the midst of intense personal struggle. It made Rock realize, \u201cI can do that too.\u201d\u201cMy time with Jenn was like a window into where my potential lies,\u201d Rock says of the confidence she gained.\u201d This opportunity [with the LEE Initiative] to take risks, do something for myself, take credit for a dish at the James Beard House\u2014that\u2019s amazing.\u201dLee and Ofcacek are already planning the next class of the LEE Initiative for 2019. A new crop of chefs have already approached them to volunteer as mentors. They\u2019ll stick to Kentucky, but hope to expand the program to more cities in the future. But for now, the two aren\u2019t making any drastic changes. They plan to do a thorough review of what worked, what didn\u2019t, and what they could do better, then get started on fundraising.\u201cI personally don\u2019t think change happens in one sweeping motion: It happens because a lot of people do millions of small good deeds,\u201d Lee says. \u201cAnd over time, they drive momentum.\u201dRock at the Beard House\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigAs the clock ticks down to 7 p.m., the 70 or so guests shuffle to find their seats at the Beard House as Rock and the chefs scramble to plate each other\u2019s dishes. After the whirlwind of a meal, Lee calls the mentees up from the kitchen to introduce them to the audience.\u201cThey were scared s**tless downstairs,\u201d Lee says into a microphone, getting a few laughs from the crowd. \u201cThey are the future of Kentucky cuisine. They are here to impress you but also to push themselves more than they ever have before.\u201dLee puts down the mic, and the diners applauded the chefs for their dishes, and their time in the program. Rock takes her certificate that says she officially cooked at the Beard House. She lingers for a moment to bask in the pride and confidence she\u2019s learned to embrace. She beams, and pushes up her glasses one more time.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsChefsRead MorecultureDear Male Chefs: Talk LessBy Julia KramerrestaurantsThe Wine Bar That\u2019s Pouring the Most Interesting Stuff in BostonBy Elyse InaminecultureWhat It's Like to be Queer, Trans, Black, and a Line CookBy  Charlie AnderleRecipes you want to make.
