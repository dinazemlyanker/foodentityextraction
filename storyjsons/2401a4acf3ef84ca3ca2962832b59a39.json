Through family dinner, of course.By Carla Lalli MusicDecember 12, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie CraigFacebookTwitterEmailEvery other Wednesday, Bon App\u00e9tit food editor at large Carla Lalli Music takes over our newsletter with a sleeper-hit recipe from the Test Kitchen vault, a cooking technique she\u2019s really into, or an ingredient she can\u2019t stop thinking about. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.I had dinner with my family on Sunday night at The Fly, one of our favorite places to eat as a foursome. What\u2019s special about The Fly is the universal excellence of everything on their very succinct menu, which means you can tell your server that you want \u201cone of everything.\u201d Shortly after ordering, our smallish square table was 100 percent occupied with a whole chicken, a chicken sandwich, roasted potatoes, fries, long-cooked greens, a big salad, white sauce and hot sauce, a couple glasses of wine, water glasses, and a napkin dispenser.Like I said, everything is worth getting, and it\u2019s never not good. The Fly is one of those places where both my teen and my 10-year-old are into all the dishes equally, and we clean our plates. I don\u2019t even mind sharing a single sandwich, and I hate sharing. The wines are great and the music is groovy and the vibes are chill. And there I was, passing a potato to my younger son so he could dip it in the chicken juices on the platter, our elbows knocking and knees touching because that\u2019s how close together we were, and I was suddenly filled with immense gratitude and joy. Our table was literally overflowing, we were hungry and we were being fed, and we had each other.Want this letter before it hits the website?

I\u2019ve been having a lot of this lately. My firstborn is turning 16 in a couple of weeks, and if you\u2019re wired like I am, that translates to \u201che\u2019s basically about to leave for college.\u201d My other son is on the precipice of some very hardcore tween-dom, which means any book I read out loud to him could be the last, and soon he will no longer let me soothe him with back rubs at bedtime.What we have, still, is family dinner. Not every night, but definitely every Sunday, and as it was for me growing up, we do most of our communing over a meal. People talk about eating their feelings. For me, eating is the feeling\u2014we are safe, we\u2019re together, we have what we need, and our life is filled with pleasure.The flip side of this, of course, is that what I\u2019ve got isn\u2019t true for everyone. This time of year can be brutal. The pressure to hemorrhage money during the \u201cshopping season\u201d debases what the holidays should or could be about, and cruelly penalizes those with less to spend. It took a perfect meal to remind me of what\u2019s really on my list. This year I\u2019ll donate again to No Kid Hungry and Southern Poverty Law Center. I\u2019ll cook all night with my mom and my sister on Christmas Eve for our annual Feast of Seven Fishes celebration. I\u2019ll get a new toy for our cat, Peggy, who we adopted on Christmas eight years ago. I\u2019ll try not to order so much stuff online, but I\u2019ll also tip our UPS guy. And I\u2019ll convene my micro family again for dinner every Sunday, because we have important feelings to do.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterRead MorecookingMy Fridge Is Full of Fat, What About Yours?By Carla Lalli MusiccultureFat Is Good, Headphones Are Bad\u2014And More Essential Cooking Rules From Carla Lalli MusicBy Carla Lalli MusiccookingCook Beans Once, Solve a Week\u2019s Worth of Dinner ProblemsBy Carla Lalli MusiccookingThe Magical Trick That Makes Every Roast Chicken Twice as NiceBy Carla Lalli MusicRecipes you want to make.
