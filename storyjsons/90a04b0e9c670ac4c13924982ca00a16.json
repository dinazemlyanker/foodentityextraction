Jordan, which...same.By Ryan Walker-HartshornAugust 27, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto R. Dione FotoPhoto by R. Dione FotoFacebookTwitterEmailIn Person of Interest, we talk to the people catching our eye right now about what they\u2019re doing, eating, reading, and loving. Next up is yoga instructor Sinikiwe Dhliwayo, who is on a mission to democratize wellness and yoga through her brand Naaya.Sinikiwe Dhliwayo is reshaping the wellness landscape one vinyasa at a time. The creative producer and yoga instructor founded Naaya in 2017 to root people of color in their wellness, making yoga and meditation more accessible through pop-up workshops and discounted teacher trainings.Dhliwayo was born in Harare, Zimbabwe, and moved to Corning, New York with her family when she was 12. She played soccer and lacrosse growing up, which, she says, taught her the value of active living and that wellness is all about agency\u2014deciding what makes sense for you and your body in the moment.Later, a stint teaching mindful movement to high schoolers in Brooklyn through the non-profit Bent On Learning sparked her passion for bringing yoga practices to more people. And as a full-time visuals editor at Hearst Magazines, Dhliwayo understands the power\u2014and limitations\u2014of visual representation. \u201cIn Western culture, a lot of erasure happens when practices become commodified,\u201d she says. \u201cIn American culture, white culture is the dominating norm\u2014often dictating who is seen in advertisements and consequently impacting peoples\u2019 perceptions.\u201dNow Dhliwayo is focused on curating a series sharing wide-ranging stories of healing from black and brown folks. And, early next year, she'll launch Naaya\u2019s 200-hour yoga teacher training program\u2014offered at half the cost of the standard $3,500 price tag to reach a larger community. This course will center yoga and social justice with a focus on equipping more teachers of color with the tools to bring these yoga practices into their own communities.We spoke with Dhliwayo about her skincare routine, her work-out hairstyle, and how she's being more discerning with her time.Right now, I\u2019m listening to \u2026 Oprah\u2019s SuperSoul Conversations podcast and NPR\u2019s Death, Sex & Money podcast.I cannot stop craving \u2026 Van Leeuwen honeycomb ice cream\u2014even though I shouldn\u2019t eat dairy.The book I\u2019m reading right now is ... Dare to Lead by Bren\u00e9 Brown. Also Lovingkindness, The Revolutionary Act of Happiness by Sharon Salzberg.Self-care to me means \u2026 whatever the moment calls for. Sometimes self-care is paying a bill I don\u2019t want to pay, but I have to pay rent for a roof over my head. One thing for me is not doing the most. When I started Naaya a year ago, I felt pressured to take every meeting and every call, and now I am being discerning about how I spend my time.My dream yoga/workout buddy is\u2026 Michael B. Jordan.My current skin care regimen \u2026 starts by washing my face with green goop, a.k.a. Youth to The People\u2019s Superfood Antioxidant Cleanser. I always use Super Goop\u2019s Superscreen daily moisturizer for my face\u2014I love it because it doesn\u2019t leave that white cast on dark skin. For my body, shea butter! And at nighttime, Mad Hippie Vitamin C serum and NOTO Botanics face oil.Activism is\u2026. seeing where there is harm being done, and using your voice to shed light on those wrongs and try to make an impact.My go to workout hair style is ... braids or Senegalese twists.My favorite yoga position is\u2026 trikonasana or side angle, because I really like the shape your body makes when you\u2019re in the pose.Within the next year, I want to see the wellness community\u2026 embody true diversity. This would mean including people of different skin tones, ethnic backgrounds, body types, etc. There is such a gap here, and I want to see the wellness community to be inclusive and making room for people who are not white and affluent.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishPerson of InterestSelf CareInterviewsRead MoreLifestyleJenny Lefcourt Won't Admit That She's the Reason You Drink Natural WineBy Marissa A.
