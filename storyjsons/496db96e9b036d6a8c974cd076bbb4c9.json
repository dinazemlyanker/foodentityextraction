She deferred her acceptance to Harvard this year because her family dinners are just that good. Okay, okay, and she\u2019s got a lot of other stuff going on. Here, she talks about her dad\u2019s vegetable garden, her mom\u2019s chocolate chip cookies, and who in the house does the dishes.What\u2019s a typical Shahidi family meal?Being half black and half Iranian, I\u2019d like to think that I hit the cultural food jackpot. Growing up we ate a lot of chicken kebab and my baba\u2014which means dad in Farsi\u2014always kept a vegetable garden, so we also ate a lot of fresh salads. There\u2019s no such thing as a bad meal in our house.What\u2019s in the garden?Basil, carrots, rosemary, mint, snap peas, and avocado. One time we even grew corn! But tomatoes are definitely our biggest crop. We used to grow so many that I would show up to playdates with bags of them for my friends\u2019 parents. And while we haven\u2019t had time for a garden in the past couple of years, because of how busy everything has been, I think just the introduction to fresh foods has left an everlasting impact.You must have developed some high standards as a kid.My uncle made fun of me because one time at a restaurant\u2014I couldn\u2019t have been more than seven\u2014I asked the waiter if the salmon was wild caught or farm-raised.What was your favorite recipe that you guys would put together with the tomatoes?Fresh pizza from scratch! It\u2019s a two-day process: My brothers and I handpick tomatoes and make the sauce with my mama while my baba mixes the dough and watches it rise all day. No one besides him can touch it.What\u2019s the situation with doing the dishes?I mean, we have a dishwasher. But it\u2019s also a collective effort. Home cooked meals for a family of five can really tear up the kitchen, so each person has their own job. One person will set the table, another will clear the table, and one of us will rinse the dishes and put them in the dishwasher. We have a little assembly line.Shahidi's Grown-ish character, Zoey.\nPhoto by Byron Cohen/ABCDoes your mom have a culinary specialty?She\u2019s the baker in the family. We have every crazy contraption you can think of in our kitchen\u2014a doughnut fryer, an ice cream maker, a bread machine. She\u2019s always trying something new, but her chocolate chip cookies are a total Shahidi classic. The other classic is my great-grandmother\u2019s sweet potato pie recipe, which comes out during the holidays and makes my heart warm.Are you ready to take off cooking for yourself when you get to college?Many of my friends started college this year, so I\u2019ve been asking them if they think I\u2019ll have enough space and the ability to prep Blue Apron in my dorm. I\u2019m trying to suss it out. I\u2019m pretty spoiled in terms of ending my day with a home-cooked meal. Right now I have no intention of moving.What will you miss most about living with your parents?Having their soup anytime I\u2019m not feeling well. During the first couple of weeks on the set of Grown-ish, I got really bad allergies and would come home to a different delicious flavor each day. I\u2019ll definitely miss that. But what\u2019s nice is that Cambridge is a university town, so I\u2019ll have lots of options. I\u2019ve been collecting a list of restaurants to go to.Suddenly craving homemade pizza:Explore Bon App\u00e9titCelebritiesRead MorecultureTracee Ellis Ross Has a Potato Chip Technique We All Need to TryBy Elyssa GoldbergtechniquesCast-Iron Skillet Pizza, Where Have You Been All Our Lives?By Rochelle BilowRecipes you want to make.
