The idea for it came about after I used frozen grapes from our freezer to cool down some sparkling water since we didn\u2019t have any ice. The anise-like flavor of tarragon syrup goes well with sweet, refreshing grape juice. Topping off the concentrate with sparkling water and adding frozen grapes makes it a modern, fun treat. \u2014Bryant TerryAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.
