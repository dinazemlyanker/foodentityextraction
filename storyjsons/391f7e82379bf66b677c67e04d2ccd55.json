The gist of the person\u2019s complaint was that cooking any recipe using sausage was not cooking from scratch, and furthermore, if you are someone who makes a living writing recipes, you are breaking all kinds of rules by suggesting this qualifies as a \u201creal\u201d recipe.It\u2019s cheating, the troll, I mean commenter, wrote. Sausage has so much flavor and so many spices that you don\u2019t need any skill to make a sausage-based dinner taste good. Exactly, I said.Because in addition to being in the business of recipes, I\u2019m in the business of feeding a bunch of ravenous, drowning-in-homework children every night, which means I put a high premium on dinners that practically cook themselves, like this grain bowl made with merguez, a lamb sausage spiked with Middle Eastern spices. Merguez is a little harder to find\u2014a good butcher will usually carry it, or look for D'Artagnan brand in better supermarkets\u2014but such it's also such a special switch-up from the regular old Italian or chorizo links that normally grace the table.I like using wheat berries in this grain bowl\u2014they're nutty and firm and hold their own flavor-wise alongside the lamb\u2014but you can also use quinoa or farro if that's what you've got lying around. I toss in the crispy merguez crumbles, add mint, parsley, cucumbers for a cooling crunch, then a punchy yogurt dressing, and the result is a low-effort, high-reward dinner that earns regular rotation status, especially if I\u2019ve been my best self and thought to prepare a batch of wheat berries the day before. (The grain simmers for just about an hour\u2014remembering to do this in advance is the most technically challenging part of the recipe.)Break out your bowls:Wheat Berry Bowl with Merguez and PomegranateYou can use any cooked grain\u2014and any type of sausage you want\u2014for this healthy but hearty dinner bowl.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titGrainsDinnerPomegranateSausageHealthyishWhole GrainWhole WheatRead MoreLifestyleWhy Do We Keep Calling Things Buddha Bowls?By Rachel Tepper PaleyRecipes you want to make.
