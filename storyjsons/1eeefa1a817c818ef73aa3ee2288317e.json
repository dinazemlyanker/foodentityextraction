I am, however, a cold person. When December\u2019s chill sets into my bones and claims squatters\u2019 rights until late April, I start supplementing my morning coffee with endless cups of, well, whatever battered teabags are in my desk drawer.It\u2019s not a good look, especially for someone who works at a food magazine. That\u2019s why I decided to skip the usual New Year\u2019s promise to go to the gym more often and give myself a fun goal: Stop using budget teabags and figure out how to steep properly. Several months later, my habits have changed, largely for good. Here\u2019s how my quest to become a tea person went down.Wednesday, 8:15 a.m.I begin my education at a New York institution: McNulty\u2019s Tea & Coffee Co. It\u2019s held down a small piece of the West Village since 1895\u2014plenty of time for the scent of sumatra beans and Earl Grey to steep into the floorboards. I arrive with a mission: Buy jasmine pearls for senior staff writer Alex Beggs, a real tea person, and upgrade my raggedy tea collection. Sounds easy enough, except I have no idea what jasmine pearls are.Co-owner Wing H. Wong explains they\u2019re just regular tea leaves that have been carefully rolled into a spherical shape, which unfurl and get better with each additional infusion of water. I ask him to recommend an \u201cinteresting\u201d black tea for me, because I truly have no idea what I\u2019m looking for. He hands me a jar of Golden Monkey, a gold-tipped black tea from China\u2019s Fujian Province that\u2019s popular with customers. (Read: Easy for a clueless person like me to like.)I drank endless cups of green genmaicha when working at a cafe in college, so I grab a bag for nostalgia\u2019s sake and check out in a blur of scooping and weighing. The $45 receipt gives me pause, so I attempt to ease the pain by calculating the cost per cup. I give up on the mental math and just hope it lasts a long time.Thursday, 3 p.m.Now that I\u2019ve transitioned to loose-leaf, I need to find a way to make it. I consult The Tea Sommelier (an encyclopedic book lifted from the office library) and learn that my beat-up strainer ball won\u2019t make the cut. For optimal flavor, tea leaves need room to expand as they steep. Beggs already went through the trouble of searching for the perfect device\u2014a little glass teapot she uses daily\u2014but I go with an infuser basket because, well, I got one as a gift. I read that I\u2019m also supposed to consider temperature control: It turns out that green tea should be steeped at a lower temperature than black tea, and if you\u2019re going to buy expensive leaves, you might as well prepare them right. Luckily, there\u2019s a temperature-controlled tea kettle in the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen. (Work perks are real.)Friday, 9:30 a.m.I skip my morning coffee and bring my new teas to work instead. After braving my morning commute without caffeine, I rush to the office tea kettle and peer inside to assess the water level. There\u2019s no water, but plenty of mold. It\u2019s an inauspicious sign, and any pretense of glamour goes out the window. I get hot water from the crappy espresso machine and wait a minute for the temperature to dip below boiling so I don\u2019t burn the Golden Monkey. It works, or at least I think it does. The black tea is smooth and surprisingly aromatic\u2014I taste cocoa and dried apricots.Friday, 3 p.m.I\u2019m too sleepy to work. One cup of Golden Monkey does not have enough caffeine to sustain me, so I brew a cup of genmaicha and decide to take a break. I sit and sip the toasty tea, which is studded with rice. The starch makes it surprisingly filling. I clean my strainer basket, and the wet tea leaves stick everywhere.Saturday, 12 p.m.Time to enter New York\u2019s ecosystem of high-end tea shops. My coworkers suggest Belloq, a \u201ctea atelier\u201d specializing in single-origin products. It\u2019s full of houseplants and golden canisters, plus a group of chic women in clogs discussing an oolong\u2019s \u201csecond steep.\u201d I eye powdery dishes of matcha and try not to sneeze. The women behind the counter start pouring me tastes of oolong while explaining what makes it so special. (Apparently, the leaves are oxidized in direct sunlight, creating a particular, peachy fragrance.) I leave with an oolong called The Phoenix, plus a golden turmeric chai laced with rose petals that, I\u2019ll be honest, is destined to appear on my Instagram.My Bellocq haul: Canyon Chai and The Phoenix oolong. Is this what being a tea influencer feels like?\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigMonday, 11 a.m.Word about my growing tea stash is out at work. A coworker recovering from a cold comes over to beg for something soothing. I send her away with oolong fortified with a drizzle of pricey manuka honey for maximum #luxury.Monday, 2 p.m.The one downside of drinking a lot more tea? A lot more bathroom trips.Wednesday, 10 a.m.I have a bad habit of leaving my tea to steep and forgetting about it entirely. Normally I wouldn\u2019t care too much, but considering how much I paid for these, I start setting timers. It feels a little precious at first, but it works. Then I lose my phone and find it buzzing in a conference room. It\u2019s a learning curve.Saturday, 4 p.m.It\u2019s the kind of winter day that makes me question why I ever left California. Snow sticks to my glasses, slush seeps into my socks. Magically, a few friends ignore the weather report and trek over to my apartment. As a gesture of gratitude, I brew mugs of my new turmeric chai and wait for them to steep for 8 minutes before passing them out. Am I peaking? It\u2019s definitely not a proper tea party (Eloise would be ashamed), but it\u2019s a start. Next time, I\u2019ll make finger sandwiches.Explore Bon App\u00e9titTeaRead MorecultureThe Little Teapot I Love So Much I Bought 2By Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
