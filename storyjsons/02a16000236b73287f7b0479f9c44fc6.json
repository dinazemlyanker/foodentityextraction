Solving this gigantic problem is more complex than this, but hey, let\u2019s do the best we can. You, individual eater with good intentions, can do the planet a teeny tiny favor and order the weird fish instead. Or support a local fishery and embrace the luck of the catch. Chef Jacob Harth of Portland, Oregon\u2019s Erizo, might love the weird fishes most of all. He cooks \u201cstuff we catch on accident,\u201d as in little guys who get scooped up in crab traps (wrong place, wrong time, little guy!). Here are a few recent favorites, lesser-known and lesser-loved creatures found along the Oregon coastline that Harth showcases in delicate, beautiful bites in his stellar tasting menu.Illustration by David BiskupWolf EelRich, fatty, and flaky-like fish\u2014because it IS a fish. The eel thing is a misnomer. Wolf eels are objectively hideous, with huge molars from crushing crabs. But wolf eels mate for life, so clearly someone\u2019s into it. When one gets caught in a crab trap, Harth steps in. He smokes it and serves it in a spread, like whitefish dip. \u201cWe can use one fish for the whole weekend because it yields 70 to 80 servings,\u201d he says.Illustration by David BiskupButter ClamA big, tender Oregon boy as creamy as his name suggests and sweeter than any scallop you\u2019ve ever had. Harth serves it almost like ceviche, with lemon and olive oil. \u201cIt\u2019s the most special thing we have here; it\u2019s like nothing else,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fact that it\u2019s not in every restaurant here is baffling.\u201dIllustration by David BiskupShield LimpetScraped off a rock just for you, this tiny, briny abalone (ahem, snail) is firm and perfect for grilling with a spritz of lemon. Harth tells me it tastes like chicken, but I think he\u2019s joking.Illustration by David BiskupGooseneck BarnaclesThese guys are ugly as sin but taste like LOBSTER, with a texture that starts off chewy \u201clike a rubber band\u201d and then melts in your mouth. Harth has a license for harvesting them and serves them at the restaurant nearly every week. Kind of a big fan.Do you like freaky fishes? Follow Chef Jacob Harth on Instagram and see them pop up in your feed when you least expect it. Like huge, flabby oysters. Something called \u201cmonkeyface eel\u201d and \u201cspotted nudibranch.\u201d Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.Read more about buying sustainable fish hereExplore Bon App\u00e9titPortlandFishRecipes you want to make.
