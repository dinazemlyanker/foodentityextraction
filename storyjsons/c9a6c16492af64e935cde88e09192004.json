It has easily worked its way into the rotation.EmilieBrooklyn, NY1/21/2022Delicious lunch. Love these French lentils. I\u2019m on a whole plant food diet ( no SOS salt oil sugar) so I used tofu feta tofu was marinated in 1/4 cup lemon juice, tablespoon oregano, 1/4 cup cider vinegar, 1/2 cup water) which turned out great. I omit oil and saut\u00e9 in water. Delicious and good for my heart \u2764\ufe0f.\nAnonymousBoston9/7/2021Absolutely delicious! LoridpVancouver BC9/3/2021It was fabulous, we used halloumi instead.  The oil is everything!! Made it twice in the same week!\nI used chipoltle peppers, limes instead of lemons, and brocollcini \nThis recipe has a solid foundation so sensible replacements work.\nWendyPeloYogiNew Rochelle, NY4/13/2021Delicious! I somehow forgot to get lemons so I used Szechuan peppercorns and substituted the fresno chile with aleppo pepper, and it was still so good. Next time I'll try it as is. This one is a keeper.BradVancouver, BC3/26/2021Fantastic! I used a Serrano instead but still a stellar recipe Pob3/11/2021Somehow...maybe...the best recipe I've ever made from BA? Literally the only thing I would change is not roasting lemon slices but instead using lemon juice, I highly suspect I used the wrong lemons because it was a bit bitter but otherwise this is the perfect recipe. You're not even ready for this. Serve with grilled bread to scoop up the last of the lentils at the end, amazing. Andy your recipes have yet to fail me!HalleSeattle, Washington3/4/2021When I made it, I burned my food till it was black and it tasted really bad. Andres Perezz Wuhan China  2/14/2021Delicious, really liked it.  Served with roasted chickenSamToronto 12/9/2020So delicious! I made it once with what I had to hand (spinach instead of broccolini, halloumi instead of feta, and red lentils instead of the firmer options, and red chili flakes instead) and it STILL came out wonderful. A kind of warm tasty bowl. Lemon added nice brightness. Second time I followed the recipe almost to a T, save for the herbs (which I didn't have) and still using red chili flakes. Firmer, more textural, tastes same: delicious! Agree with others that it is the OIL that makes this dish; might try experimenting with it and other combos soon :)AnonymousBoston MA9/7/2020We absolutely love this recipe - and always double it for the amazing lunch leftovers. Seems like it\u2019s going to be too much oil, but it\u2019s perfect as written. AnonymousWashington, DC8/17/2020Sweet baby jesus this was a good one. Only modifications I did was Jalape\u00f1os instead of red chili - turned out amazing. \n\nI followed all the other instructions step by step. The recipe sounded kind of boring to me but oh my god, it tastes heavenly with some french green lentils. It's so simple but all the flavors work so well together. Definitely use 1/2 cup of some good EVOO too, I think that makes a big difference. And fresh herbs as well. unkavehAtlanta, Georgia7/17/2020I LOVE this recipe.  I've never ground my own herbs before and the freshly ground coriander and fennel were such a treat!  Doing this has opened my eyes to even more flavor possibilities.  Thanks so much!!Jocelyn KorabBoston, MA7/5/2020Great recipe - started it, realized I didn't actually have lentils, so I used wheatberries instead.  I poured the hot oil over sliced radishes and then mixed in the wheatberries.  A great method that is clearly very adaptable for quarantine times! AnonymousPhilly5/29/2020Made this with French green lentils (1 cup was plenty), regular broccoli (florets and sliced stems), 1 jalapeno, and a mix of cilantro and parsley for the herbs.  It is a bit of a project, but was totally worth it!  The oil makes the dish, and the feta is vital.  Eating warmed leftovers with a little avocado thrown in today - very good!  I think you could throw some toasted pine nuts on top, as well.Laurie HeilHuntington Beach, CA4/22/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titFetaCheeseBroccoliVegetableFrench LentilLentilBlack LentilWeeknight MealsMainVegetarianNut-FreeGluten-FreeHealthyishLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
