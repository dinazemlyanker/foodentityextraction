That and my heart health.\u00a0By Alex BeggsOctober 30, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Laura MurrayFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.If you\u2019ve ever gone months to years without regularly exercising, you might be familiar with this routine:Realize your body is slowly degradingCommit to trying a new workout, gym, or karate dojoBuy new shoes, headband, gym lock, gym bag, shower flip-flops, anything else that will materialistically help get your ass to the gymGet there, do the thing, cheer for self!!!!Well, I recently went through that, and now I\u2019m a happy member of the YMCA, the greatest gym in America, where I spin for 20 to 30 sweaty minutes or slap water in the pool if it isn\u2019t too crowded. Yay me! Enough of that. Let\u2019s get to my sole motivation for working out: This water bottle from the New York bike shop NYC Velo. It\u2019s $12 and it looks like a little bottle of Aperol.It doesn\u2019t appear to be made by the Campari Group, which produces Aperol, so it miiiight be in trademark violation, but I hope they never get in trouble for it. Parody, right? It\u2019s hot pink with a bright blue lid. The label has an Aperol Spritz recipe on it, as if you don\u2019t already have it memorized. Other than its obvious aesthetic perfection, the bottle\u2019s design is key for those who Exercise: It has a \u201csport\u201d top, meaning I can squeeze water into my mouth without unscrewing a cap or stabbing a plastic straw up my nostril or spilling all over my face. I can open and close it with the strength of my teeth, like the gladiator I am. The whole time I\u2019m spinning on a bike going nowhere, my cheerful water bottle reminds me that there\u2019s a reward (this is important to have when you\u2019re trying to get into exercise) at the end of this minor torture: a steam, or a bath, maybe a cocktail.This isn\u2019t an insulated desk bottle to refill at the water cooler six times a day. It\u2019s for the gym or bike or whenever else you need to squeeeeeeze. It\u2019s plastic, therefore it sweats\u2014but so do I. I refuse to see that as a downside. I take the cold condensation and wipe it on the back of my neck after an especially grueling 18-minute ride. I\u2019m not training for the Tour de France here, I\u2019m just trying to have a good time.
