It\u2019s the fastest way to a winning weeknight dinner, and an excellent base for days on days of lunch al desko.  Case in point: This easy stir-fry, which combines a flexible mix of whole grains with kimchi and a riffable array of toppings.These kimchi-fried grains are so trustworthy, they\u2019re part of BA\u2019s New Essentials, a.k.a. the 29 recipes that define how we cook now. Having a bunch of precooked grains lying around may sound far-fetched, but our favorite one-size-fits-all method for big batch grain cooking makes having extra farro on-hand surprisingly realistic.  Senior food editor Claire Saffitz, who developed this recipe, says: \u201cI rarely make kimchi fried rice because it feels white starch-heavy, but this recipe is a very quick and healthy weeknight meal that repurposes those extra whole grains.\u201dStir fries go fast, which is why they\u2019re so great for weeknights. That quick cook time comes down to two bits of prep: chopping your ingredients in advance and sticking to an order of operations (more on that below). No need to freak out over the Top Chef-perfect mise en place\u2014just chop your kimchi, carrots, and scallions, then scoot them into little piles on the side of your cutting board.The Stir-Fried Grains Order of OperationsStart with a few lacy fried eggs, because you can take them out of the pan and set aside to top with later. Raw vegetables (in this recipe\u2019s case, carrots) go in the pan next, as they take the longest to cook, followed by scallions and kimchi. This technique is about rehydrating grains, so save them for last so they won\u2019t dry out. Almost any grains you have lying around will do, from farro and quinoa to barley and buckwheat. And yes, kimchi-fried rice also works.The final step: Add soy sauce, sesame oil and reserved kimchi juice for two minutes\u2014long enough to soften the grain\u2019s bite. \u201cYou\u2019re not frying so much as rehydrating, because whole grains get an outside bran that\u2019s heavy and tough,\u201d Saffitz says. \u201cAdd liquid so they soften and steam.\u201d And the next thing you know, dinner is done.These grains are a true pantry meal\u2014you can customize it with almost anything. Top with fried eggs, nori, and sesame seeds, or reach for whatever specialty condiment you picked up as an impulse buy last week at the store. Go for scrambled eggs instead of fried, or bulk it up with roasted chicken, flaked salmon, or leftover roasted vegetables. Does dinner taste better when it comes together in less time than an episode of The Office? Maybe, but an extra splash kimchi juice can't hurt.Grab that kimchi jar:Kimchi-Fried GrainsThis easy stir-fry, combined with the trusty #putaneggonit, is irresistible.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishKimchiGrainsRiceRead MorecookingSteak Salad with Rice Noodles Is the Weeknight Dinner We Could Eat ForeverBy Chris MoroccoRecipes you want to make.
