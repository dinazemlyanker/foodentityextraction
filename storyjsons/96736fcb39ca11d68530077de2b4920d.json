But this year, in honor of Super Bowl LVI being hosted at the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, we asked two locals\u2014Elize Diop, a staff writer on HBO\u2019s forthcoming show, Rap Sh*t, and Brad Johnson, a longtime restaurateur and host of the Corner Table Talk podcast\u2014to share their favorite spots in Inglewood, the host neighborhood. Whether you\u2019re gearing up to watch the Cincinnati Bengals face off against the L.A. Rams or just looking for a good meal in the area, here\u2019s where to eat in Inglewood, L.A.Breakfast and BrunchPhotograph by Andrea D'AgostoThe Serving SpoonI go here when I want to feel like my mom cooked me breakfast. The portions are perfect and everything is seasoned to perfection. I love the bacon omelet with a side of cheesy grits. While you wait for a table, you can take a look at the hundreds of photos of celebrities and regular customers who love the Serving Spoon. \u2014Elize DiopHilltop Coffee + KitchenFull disclosure: My sister is an investor. But even without her involvement, I wouldn\u2019t miss the breakfast or lunch. Here the food is super colorful with unique flavor combinations. If I\u2019m there for breakfast, I order one of the super-filling breakfast sandwiches or burritos. A side of the verde sauce takes both of these to a whole other level. If I\u2019m there for lunch, I\u2019ll order a short rib grilled cheese with a side of buffalo cauliflower. The food is consistently delicious and filling\u2014in a way that doesn\u2019t feel heavy. Any of the seasonal lattes are worth trying, but my personal year-round favorite is the matcha-chata, a matcha-horchata hybrid that\u2019s creamy, cinnamony, and ice-cold (or hot if that\u2019s your thing). \u2014E.D.Photograph by Erica AllenPost & BeamWhile it\u2019s not technically in Inglewood, this Baldwin Hills spot, 15 minutes from the neighborhood, will appeal to anyone looking for a great Sunday brunch, whether you like savory or sweet. Before I began splitting my time between L.A. and Miami, this was my spot, literally: I opened and owned Post & Beam for years before selling it. When I\u2019m back in Los Angeles, I still go for shrimp and grits, outstanding buttermilk pancakes, and the Napa peach Bellini. \u2014Brad JohnsonLunch and DinnerMaria\u2019s Ricos TacosWhen I want a really good California burrito, this is my spot. I opt for grilled chicken instead of carne asada. While you\u2019re there, try the super refreshing pi\u00f1a drink\u2014a pineapple-spinach juice that\u2019s so deliciously sweet, you\u2019ll forget there\u2019s spinach in it. \u2014E.D.Photograph by Stephen Mastrocola/@OenoFilms\u00a0Sunday GravyOne of Inglewood\u2019s newest hidden gems makes some of the tastiest Italian food I\u2019ve ever had. The meatballs and ricotta are out of this world. I\u2019ve never ordered anything I didn\u2019t love from this restaurant. The fresh pasta and artisan bread make all the difference. You can taste the quality in every bite. \u2014E.D.All of their pastas are made fresh by Florentyna\u2019s. Don\u2019t miss the lasagna, which often sells out\u2014and, as the menu says, once they\u2019re out, they\u2019re out. \u2014B.J.Ms. B\u2019s M & M Soul FoodIt\u2019s soul food. You know what you like. I\u2019m partial to the turkey wings, cabbage, candied yams, and banana pudding. \u2014B.J.\u00a0Photograph courtesy Jerusalem ChickenJerusalem ChickenThis is a casual neighborhood favorite located less than five miles from the Super Bowl stadium. Everything looks, smells, and tastes delicious, but I\u2019m especially a fan of the lemon chicken and rice. The crispy skin, the tangy sauce, and the fluffy rice combine to make an ideal meal on the go. \u2014B.J.Desserts and DrinksPhotograph Courtesy of Sweet Red PeachSweet Red PeachI will wait in line for their desserts, which fulfill all of my sweet cravings! They have an amazing red velvet strawberry cheesecake cupcake that is super decadent, fluffy, and moist (do people still hate that word?). Another cupcake I love is the peach cobbler cupcake that\u2019s topped with pieces of glazed peaches. Such a tasty treat. There\u2019s usually a line out the door so be prepared to wait for your goodies. \u2014E.D.Simply WholesomeIt\u2019s a few miles from Inglewood, but this place has a terrific vibe and great people-watching. My favorite juice is the Reawaken, made with organic mint leaves, apple juice, orange juice, fresh sprouts, turmeric powder, and a hint of crystallized ginger. \u2014B.J.Explore Bon App\u00e9titSuper BowlRecipes you want to make.
