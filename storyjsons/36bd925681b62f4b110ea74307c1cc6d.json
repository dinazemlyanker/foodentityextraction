It\u2019s a neighborhood joint that isn\u2019t fueled by ambition but by comfort and dependability. All those hipster beer-and-a-shot joints want to be this when they grow up. But Deep Eddy has been that way since 1951\u2014and there\u2019s nowhere else in Austin I\u2019d rather drink a pitcher of Lone Star.That wondrous experience starts before I even enter the bar. Deep Eddy\u2019s fluorescent, back-lit sign\u2014with an inexplicable baby blue tornado logo and midcentury, serifed red letters\u2014illuminates a corner that, unlike most of Austin, is incredibly quiet and surrounded by houses and a glowing Chevron station.And once you walk in, it\u2019s a vibe all Deep Eddy\u2019s own. Pool tables. A UT football game on the TV. Pitchers of beer and bags of Fritos covering laminated wood tables. Decades old, worn, stackable chairs, and a jukebox blasting Willie Nelson or the like. A cigarette machine that seems not to have gotten the memo that cigarette machines don\u2019t really see action anymore. The occasional burger, delivered from Larry McGuire\u2019s Pool Burger just behind the building. Christmas lights hanging from the ceiling. Neon signs and brewery placards on every inch of the walls. A collection of knick-knacks\u2014from hockey masks to postcards to footballs to family portraits\u2014that seem to have come from just about every part of the country. And everyone else who decided to show up that night: mostly Austinites, young and old, buzzed and...slightly more than buzzed.But for all that Deep Eddy is, it\u2019s what it isn\u2019t that makes it truly phenomenal: It isn\u2019t a wine bar. Or a beer bar. It isn\u2019t a whiskey bar. Or a cocktail bar. Deep Eddy Cabaret is just a dive bar. And a damn good one at that.Go there: Deep Eddy CabaretExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendBarsAustinRead MorerestaurantsIt\u2019s Called Spaghett and It\u2019s Now My Favorite Summer CocktailBy Alex DelanyRecipes you want to make.
