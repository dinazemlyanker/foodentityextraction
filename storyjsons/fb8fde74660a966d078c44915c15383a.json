And associating the worst part of the weekend with the day it happens has given Sunday a bad rap. And that\u2019s why, come Sunday night, I open something special. I do it for me, and I do it for Sunday.The idea is simple: I save something exceptional for the very end of my weekend, so I actually end up looking forward to the termination of my two-day sabbatical as much as I anticipated the beginning. It\u2019s a maneuver that eases my re-entry into the work week (that may or may not have been proven by some psychologist somewhere to actually work?).For me, this treat is usually a bottle I\u2019ve been saving: a cider, wine, or beer that I\u2019m stoked to taste. Last Sunday, for example, I opened a bottle of Frequency Illusion: Skin Contact from Ardmore, PA\u2019s Tired Hands Brewing Company. What the hell is that? you may be asking. Why is it so exciting?This beer is fermented on spent Pennsylvania Merlot grapes, which means that as the sugar in the grain ferments, so does the residual juice in the grapes. It\u2019s part beer and part wine, and it\u2019s a drink that\u2019s unlike anything else. You can\u2019t buy it at your liquor store. You can\u2019t pick up a six pack of this stuff at the gas station. It is, as it sounds, special. The symphony of tropical fruit flavor, pleasant bitterness, tannin, acidity, and subtle sweetness lifts me out of my surroundings and places me gently into a place of pure enjoyment. I smile at the thought of drinking something like this, which means I smile at the thought of Sunday night.But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to follow the same path. You can go the booze-free route. You can save the last episode of whatever show you\u2019ve been watching the week prior. You can break into the expensive chocolate bar that\u2019s been sitting in your fridge. You can eat a slice of the carrot cake you baked on Saturday morning. It doesn\u2019t matter what you choose, as long as it brings you joy.And no, I don\u2019t usually drain the whole bottle by myself. My girlfriend or my roommate or my roommate\u2019s girlfriend usually lends a hand. Because you can\u2019t go raging into Monday. As Fergus Henderson once wrote, \u201cDon\u2019t let the cure become the cause.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titGuide to SundayHealthyishAlcohol & Other DrinksBeeressayRead MorecultureAmericans Have Been Doing Cider Wrong Forever, and It's Time to ChangeBy Alex DelanyRecipes you want to make.
