With ghee-toasted almonds, golden raisins, and fresh scallions, this pilaf is definitely not diet food.By Aliza AbarbanelFebruary 4, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Susie TheodorouFacebookTwitterEmailDespite my very best intentions, I\u2019ve always found cauliflower rice to be a bit of a disappointment. There\u2019s nothing exciting about eating a bowl of mush, especially when there is actual rice to be had. I\u2019ll admit to a few flirtations with Trader Joe\u2019s frozen cauliflower rice several years ago, but that relationship ended when I realized I\u2019d rather be eating my cauliflower pretty much any other way\u2014especially roasted in a blazing hot oven until each floret is caramelized and crunchy. Then Lauren Schaefer developed a cauliflower rice pilaf that showed me the light.Schaefer\u2019s weeknight-friendly recipe taps a few key ingredients\u2014sliced almonds, golden raisins, scallions, ground cinnamon\u2014to give riced cauliflower that much-needed makeover. \u201cIt\u2019s the same principal with salads: You want something crunchy, something salty, and something fresh,\u201d she says. \u201cI see cauliflower rice in everyone\u2019s carts at the grocery store, but I feel like it\u2019s something you eat alone\u2014but I think anything you eat by yourself, you should feel proud to eat with other people.\u201d You can turn a plain old head of cauliflower into \u201crice\u201d by pulsing pieces in a food processor, but I live in a New York City apartment with minimal counter space (read: limited appliances), so I just bought it pre-made at Trader Joe\u2019s. It was time to give those frozen bags another chance.The makeover began by toasting sliced almonds in a pool of ghee. The rich, buttery smell gave me hope. These nuts should be golden brown, not burnt brown, so I took them off the heat as soon as they started to look golden and let them finish cooking as they cooled. Then I added cinnamon and red pepper flakes and poured the whole delicious-smelling mixture into a big bowl. Next I heated a bit more ghee in that same pan, saut\u00e9ed some sliced scallions and golden raisins, and added the cauliflower. A little steam released, no biggie, but soon the aromatics and cauliflower became one harmonious mixture. I poured the whole thing into the big bowl and tossed until the cauliflower rice was completely coated in spiced ghee. Then I topped the pilaf with sliced scallion greens and took a bite. Just like that, I was a cauli-rice convert.The buttery blend of warming spices coated each cauliflower crumb, which were studded with toasty shards of almonds and sweet pops of chopped raisins. It was a supremely comforting bite. I decided to serve the pilaf with homemade yogurt flatbread (I'm clearly not trying to give up carbs) and quick-pickled cucumbers, but I\u2019m already planning to serve it with a roast chicken for an easy dinner party. It\u2019s a vegetable dish and a starchy side all in one\u2014plus I\u2019m itching to share this cauliflower rice treatment with my friends. It'll make them believers too.Give cauliflower rice a chance:Cauliflower Rice PilafThis cauliflower rice recipe is very adaptable; just use what you find in your cabinets.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishCauliflowerRice PilafSideRead MoreLifestyleApologies to My Husband But Cauliflower Bolognese Is My Boyfriend NowBy Sarah JampelRecipes you want to make.
