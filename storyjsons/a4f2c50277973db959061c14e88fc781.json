The 96-year-old, self-proclaimed \u201cgeriatric starlet\u201d and consummate fashion insider spends the winters at her home in Palm Beach, Florida, where we spoke in January.Well-known by fashion and design insiders for decades, Apfel is the former owner of Old World Weavers, a textile firm commissioned by nine U.S. presidents\u2014from Truman to Clinton\u2014to design the interiors of the White House. Apfel garnered even more attention in 2005 when her personal style was the subject of an exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Since retiring in 1992, Apfel has not slowed down; this past July, a documentary about her life, Iris, directed by Albert Maysles was nominated for an Emmy. She also serves as the face of Happy Socks, designs collections for the Home Shopping Network, and is a regular presence at the Met Gala and New York Fashion Week. In March, Apfel published her collection of illustrated thoughts and observations, Iris Apfel: Accidental Icon.Even with a hectic schedule at 96, Apfel\u2019s skin is glowing; she\u2019s full of energy, and her laugh is as infectious as her style is unique\u2014much of this she contributes to her healthy but simple approach towards life. Even though her perspective on the world hasn\u2019t changed much, one thing that has changed for Apfel in the last several years is her eating habits.\u201cWhen I was young, my husband and I were very adventurous,\u201d she recalls. \u201cWe traveled a lot, and there wasn\u2019t anything we didn\u2019t try.\u201d Apfel says her husband made \u201cthe best omelet,\u201d thanks to a lesson from their close friend and La Grenouille founder, Charles Masson. But neither Apfel nor her husband (who died in 2015) cooked regularly. \u201cWe worked very hard, and we had erratic hours\u201d she explains. Now, as she approaches a century of life, she has altered her diet to simpler foods. \u201cI don\u2019t like rich things,\u201d she says. \u201cand a big portion always scares me off.\u201dApfel\u2019s lunches and dinners typically consist of a white fish or other lean meat with lots of vegetables and fruit for dessert. She readily admits she has become a creature of habit when it comes to food, but one with high standards. \u201cI never buy ground hamburger meat. We always get a good steak and we grind it here at home.\u201d She eats fruit for dessert (anything except watermelon), though she\u2019s known to accept a slice of pumpkin pie during the holidays.She\u2019s been hip to the benefits of turmeric for decades and wary of fad diets. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in trends of any kind. I think they\u2019re all cuckoo,\u201d she says. \u201cI think the best diet is to push yourself away from the table.\u201d She avoids raw fish and other uncooked meats after witnessing the cholera epidemic 40 years ago in Naples, Italy (it had been caused by mussels).Apfel doesn\u2019t take any supplements, and she doesn\u2019t stray from her regular foods when she travels. When asked whether she has a favorite restaurant, meal, or food to recommend, she says, \u201cThat\u2019s a dumb question,\u201d and she has a point. \u201cI don\u2019t eat junk food, I don\u2019t take a lot of salt, I don\u2019t drink sodas, and, most importantly, I don\u2019t advise anyone,\u201d she declares. \u201cIt\u2019s not my place to tell other people how to live.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishprofileRead MorecultureStella Bugbee Makes Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner While We're Still AsleepBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
