Way too much tamarind in the recipe, which made it nearly inedible. Ben B.Seattle, WA11/12/2021Tasty with some heat. Based on other reviews, I cut back the tamarind to 2 Tbsp. I agree that the description mentioned sweet as part of the flavor profile and sweet is lacking. Next time I\u2019ll add some coconut or brown sugar.  I only had lemon on hand, which worked fine. And I used a Kirby from my garden, which I seeded. I\u2019ll use two cucs next time. Went nicely with our Thai leftovers from last night\u2019s dinner. LIMamaLong Island8/8/2021It's a loooot of tamarind. We ended up putting some agave to add sweetness and some avocado to mellow it out. The mix of components are a good idea but the proportions seem way off.AnonymousBrooklyn, N Y5/3/2021Where does the sweet come in? I\"m not seeing any ingredients that would offer a sweet taste? I followed the recipe and found the sauce overly bitter, so I'd love to sweeten it up.AnonymousMinnesota8/22/2020Honestly, this is the best salad in the world. It is simple and so flavourful. I make this once a week and crave it even more frequently. I couldn't find tamarind and did extra lime juice + brown sugar. I dream about this salad.HighlightergirlToronto7/25/2020This is so good wow. Didn\u2019t have fried shallots the second time I made this and still so good. Subbed serranos for Thai Chile\u2019s. Will be in my summer salad rotation for sure AnonymousSan Francisco6/19/2020Can this be made ahead of time? Or will it get mushy? Made it right before serving and it was the perfect blend of flavor! AnonymousChicago 5/25/2020This is the most delicious salad I've ever made in my life. Perfect for a hot LA day. Like I said before, don't skip the crispy fried shallots or peanuts. I can't edit my last review but I meant to leave 5 stars not 4. 15/10 would make again.lifeis_shortLos Angeles, CA4/22/2020Note the crispy fried shallot and crushed peanut toppings are not included in the ingredients list, they are only mentioned at the very end. If you can't find any crispy fried shallots at the store, BA has a separate recipe for crispy fried shallots from Molly Baz. Make sure to get some peanuts to crush up too. The toppings really make it a great salad with different dimensions. The wording of this recipe needs to be updated to include the crispy fried shallots and peanuts in the ingredients list.lifeis_shortLos Angeles, CA4/22/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladSoutheast AsianAsianCucumberVegetableCherry TomatoTomatoTamarindCondiments, Sauces & PastesEasyQuickSideDairy-FreeGluten-FreeHealthyishDinnerRecipes you want to make.
