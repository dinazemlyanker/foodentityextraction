It does need to sit in the fridge overnight to achieve its creamy texture, so plan accordingly. Watch Priya Krishna make shahi toast here.Recipe adapted with permission from Indian-ish by Priya Krishna with Ritu Krishna (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt). Copyright \u00a9 2019.\u00a0Ingredients4\u20136 servings2cups heavy cream6Tbsp. sugar1tsp. ground cardamom, preferably freshly ground2Tbsp. vegetable oil5slices white bread, crusts removed,  each slice cut into quarters2Tbsp. coarsely chopped pistachiosPreparationStep 1Coat bottom of a medium saucepan with 2 Tbsp. water (this will prevent the cream from sticking when you heat it). Add cream and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; add sugar and cardamom and stir until sugar is dissolved. Set aside.Step 2Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Reduce heat to medium-low and, working in batches if needed, cook bread until golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes per side.Step 3Arrange bread in a 9x9\" baking dish in a single layer. Give reserved cardamom cream a stir to reincorporate, then pour over bread, making sure each piece is fully saturated. Cover with plastic wrap and chill at least 8 hours and up to 2 days.Step 4Top bread pudding with pistachios just before serving.How would you rate Cardamom Bread Pudding?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (4)Back to TopTriangleEnjoyed this simple dessert. Nice flavours, making it for the third time. AnonymousNew Brunswick Canada3/10/2021This was very good! I'm half Iranian so cardamom and pistachios are a flavor I grew up eating in desserts. I added a few threads of saffron for flavor/ color. Tastes like gulab jamun and kheer had a baby (or maybe just reminded me of ras malai?). \n If you like kulfi or Persian ice cream/baklava this would be good with a TBL (or less) rosewater added to the milk mixture when you stir in the sugar/cardamom. If you're not used to rose try a teaspoon in the mixture and go from there.  All my roomies liked it, will be making again. AnonymousSan Diego, CA 5/8/2020This was terrible.  2 Libra family members and neither  liked it.Anonymous117545/2/2020I made this recipe recently for a virtual form of a cookbook club I'm in. I love Priya's book, but there aren't many sweets and I love sweets so this was my choice. I made the recipe exactly as written and even used the whole cardamom pods (wow, amazing scent) and this was absolutely delicious. I didn't plan ahead enough and had to eat some prior to the pudding soaking for a full 8 hours, but it was still SO good and my husband and kids love it too. Very unique flavor and a great way to end a meal. This book overall is a winner and I love Priya!
