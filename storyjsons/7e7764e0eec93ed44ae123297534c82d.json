You're welcome.By Alex DelanyJanuary 25, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailTuukka KoskiFacebookTwitterEmailChocolate sauce seems fancy. And to be clear, it can be, when drizzled over decadent French desserts with 73-step recipes. But that's not why you're here. You want to learn how to make chocolate sauce the Basically way, because you, too, are about that lazy life\u2014but the kind of lazy life that involves pouring chocolate sauce all over ice cream on a Wednesday night. This life is attainable. You can live like this.You can make chocolate sauce in about five minutes. And hold onto your seats, because this is about to get a little wilder. You only need two ingredients to make it. Yeah. Five minutes and two ingredients. Sounds like you should be making chocolate sauce every night, just for the hell of it.Now, this isn\u2019t hot fudge. We\u2019re not cooking sugars or using a candy thermometer. Our quick chocolate sauce is more like ganache, the 50/50 mix of cream and chocolate that firms up at room temperature. To make this more of a sauce, we change the proportions to 1 part chocolate and 2 parts heavy cream, which gives it a rich, luscious, pourable texture. This means that it will never really set. It\u2019s not going to harden perfectly around a pretzel or spread like frosting at room temperature. But you can spoon it over everything from sliced strawberries to store-bought pound cake, and feel like a king doing it.You can use whatever type of chocolate you like for this, just as long as it is less than 68% dark. For a sweeter version, use some good ol\u2019 fashioned milk chocolate, and for something a bit more bitter and complex, go for a darker chocolate.There ya go.\nThe cooking process is simple. Pour the cream and chocolate into a regular, small sauce pan (not one of those fancy double boilers), and melt your chocolate over low heat. Once the chocolate starts to melt, stir it continually to make sure it spreads even throughout the cream. Since you\u2019re using low heat, you won\u2019t burn the chocolate, but you still don\u2019t want to just let it go. The sauce will be loose coming straight from the pot; if you want it to be a little thicker, remove it from the heat for five minutes.This pound cake needs chocolate sauce. Now you know how to make chocolate sauce. The future is yours.\nHirsheimer & HamiltonGood news: You have options for what to do with this sauce. It works perfectly drizzled over a date night chocolate Dutch baby, and it makes an icing-free chocolate cake ten times as decadent. But in the true spirit of weeknight dessert, we love chocolate sauce as an add-on for store-bought goods. Letting this sauce rain down over ice cream, using it as a dip for shortbread cookies, or schmearing it across a slice of pound cake makes you look like you\u2019re a damn professional. Don\u2019t worry. We won\u2019t mention the fact that you aren\u2019t.Once you know how to make chocolate sauce, you're halfway to that Dutch baby...Chocolate Dutch BabyFaster than a souffl\u00e9, easier than a molten chocolate cake, and more delicious than both.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyChocolateSauceDessertRecipes you want to make.
