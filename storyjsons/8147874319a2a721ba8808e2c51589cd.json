Sure, the lasagna and black-sesame-striped caramelle are all over the Internet, but the sleeper hits here are the carb-less ones. We can\u2019t get enough of the scallion pancake-like garlic flatbread; crunchy chrysanthemum salad speckled with sesame and Parm; antipasto salad (think Italian sub in salad form!); barbecue calamari with pepperoni fried rice; and Roman pasta-inspired grilled orata alla gricia.THE VIBE IS: old-school cool. A warm, pinkish light and less-than-ideal acoustics lend a club-like vibe, but the beautiful black marble bar, with rounded, meandering edges, mean more space to hang out at the bar and chat with your friends as you wait for a table.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open for dinner every day: Sunday to Wednesday, from 5:30 p.m. to 11 p.m., and Thursday to Saturday, from 5:30 p.m. to midnight, but the bar opens at 5 p.m. Reservations can be tough, so book ahead through Resy at least a few weeks out.\u2014Elyse InamineAshley SearsLiz ClaymanAshley SearsWE ALSO LOVEBuvetteTr\u00e8s West Village, with hints of ParisLiliaA special occasion spot that changes the pasta paradigmBemelmans BarFlawless cocktails in a flawless Upper East Side roomExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
