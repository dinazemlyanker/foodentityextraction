If you sign up for our newsletter, you\u2019ll get her letter before everyone else.I\u2019d never been one to drink at home and that didn\u2019t change much even when I stopped going out three or four nights a week. It\u2019s not the drinking that I missed so much as the act of going to a bar, of rallying friends to celebrate (or complain), of hashing out a problem over glasses of chilled red, of sitting alone with a book at a bar and asking the server too many questions about wine.Now, though, with two vaccine doses behind me, the weather turning, and the spring produce coming in, I\u2019ve been stalking cocktail menus kind of aggressively and have started to order more drinks to go. Basil, snap peas, cucumbers, and strawberries all play well with gin, my spirit of choice, and it\u2019s been fun to see those show up on website menus and in people\u2019s Instagram feeds, featured in drinks dotted with violet petals or little sprigs of herbs. Last weekend when we ordered takeout from Atlanta\u2019s Talat Market (Bon Appetit\u2019s October 2020 cover star!), I ordered a to-go cocktail made with green mango (!); at nearby Little Bear there\u2019s a strawberry rum Negroni I have yet to try but cannot stop thinking about.I\u2019m so ready to be back in bars, to banter, to debate glassware and sweetness and bubbles, to maybe\u2014one day\u2014even sneak sips again from my friends\u2019 drinks. But until then I\u2019m so grateful for this change in seasons and for the bartenders who are really taking advantage of it in their cocktail menus.I\u2019d love to hear what you\u2019re drinking (or what you want to be), if you want to shoot me a note at sonia@bonappetit.com. And if you do like to make drinks at home, definitely check out the interactive Cocktail Cabinet my coworkers at Epicurious created, which can help you find a drink (nonalcoholic or with booze) based on what you have at home.Explore Bon App\u00e9titLetter From The EditorRecipes you want to make.
