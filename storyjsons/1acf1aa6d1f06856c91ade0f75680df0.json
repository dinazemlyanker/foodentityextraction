I prefer a mix of \u201cbartender working\u201d and \u201cpeople talking.\u201dBy Priya KrishnaMarch 11, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailBefore the pandemic I had this very specific routine whenever I would meet someone out for dinner. I\u2019d show up to the place about 20 minutes before the reservation, find a spot at the bar, and order a drink. I\u2019d eavesdrop on conversations, strike up a chat with the bartender, glance at other tables to see what looked most exciting to order. The frenetic energy of a busy New York restaurant always brought a deep sense of calm, erasing any impulse to scroll Instagram or check my texts. In those moments, I could just sip my drink and feel at ease (a feat for this type-A, anxiety-riddled human).It\u2019s been almost exactly a year since I last sat alone at a bar. I\u2019d showed up early to a friend\u2019s birthday dinner at Hearth in mid-March, ordered a glass of red wine, and surveyed the restaurant. But things felt different. The dining room was empty. The bartenders were visibly nervous. I couldn\u2019t resist the urge to keep getting up to wash my hands.For months during the pandemic I tried to recreate some version of my bar ritual at home. I\u2019d wrap up work, put on Ella Fitzgerald or Sam Cooke, and pour myself a glass of wine or a cocktail. It was nice, but never as good as going out. Sitting by yourself just doesn\u2019t hit the same way when you\u2019re actually alone.Then, about a month ago, Andr\u00e9a Hernandez (creator of the Snaxshot newsletter) Tweeted about a site called I Miss My Bar. It was launched last June by Ren\u00e9 C\u00e1rdenas and Oscar Romo, who run the popular Maverick Monterrey in Mexico. The idea behind the project was to help users (me!) recreate their ideal bar ambiance at home. It\u2019s incredibly straightforward yet extremely effective. The single page site lets you toggle between familiar sounds: A bartender shaking a cocktail or muddling herbs, the thrum of cars driving down the street, or the gentle pop of a wine bottle and the slow, easy pour into a glass. You can turn on multiple tracks at once, raising and lowering their volumes to create a custom mood. My perfect evening is a combination of \u201cbartender working,\u201d \u201cserving drinks,\u201d and \u201crain on window\u201d (on full blast), with \u201cpeople talking\u201d and \u201cstreet ambiance\u201d in the background. There are also rotating playlists on the site, curated by different bars, that accompany the sounds.C\u00e1rdenas\u2019 creative studio, Tandem, designed the look and feel, and Lagom developed the site. Most of the sounds were recorded at Maverick itself (if you listen closely to \u201cstreet ambiance,\u201d you can hear the shouts of the local bread guy selling his goods), while others were borrowed from online sound libraries. \u201cA bar is not just about the actual cocktail,\u201d C\u00e1rdenas says. \u201cIt is about the experience. It is about being there with friends, yet being surrounded by strangers. Even though they are strangers, you feel some company [with them]. It is about the music, the smell, the sound. We tried to make this some sort of companion of the experience\u2014giving people a tool to take the bar home.\u201dI usually head to I Miss My Bar during the last few hours of work, or when I\u2019m starting up a happy hour in my living room for my partner and me. I know friends who have come to rely on listening to other sounds\u2014a busy coffee shop or waves crashing on a crowded beach\u2014that evoke pre-pandemic moments. But the bar noises are what do it for me (and over 500,000 other unique monthly site visitors). I know it will probably be a while until I can set foot in a busy bar and perch on a stool, taking in the energy of the place. I Miss My Bar gives me a taste of those serene moments, while reminding me of what I have to look forward to post-pandemic. And for now, I\u2019ll drink to that.Recipes you want to make.
