When something\u2019s so easy to make that you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.If you were to ask my parents if they eat fruits and vegetables with their meals, my mom would immediately respond with something along the lines of \u201cWe eat maduritos on a weekly basis.\u201d And while I don\u2019t really consider maduritos (what my family calls fried sweet plantains) to be on the same level as steamed broccoli, it\u2019s true that in Nicaragua, it\u2019s common to have this tropical fruit as a complement to whatever entree you\u2019re serving.Maduritos, also known as maduros, are common in Latinx restaurants and in our Nicaraguan home, and I would never be one to turn them down, so trust me when I tell you that my family\u2019s pl\u00e1tanos maduros horneados (a.k.a. baked sweet plantains) scratch that same itch but are even easier to make.For as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve been eating this baked plantain dish along with jam\u00f3n and relleno during the holidays with family in Nicaragua. That meant having it on Christmas Eve with my mom\u2019s side of the family in Chinandega and for lunch on Christmas Day at my dad\u2019s parents\u2019 house in Managua. Lucky for me, we\u2019ve carried this tradition with us to the United States, and I\u2019ve recently turned it into an early autumn comfort food for my family too.Keep in mind that many of my Nicaraguan family recipes are never written down exactly as they are made, but are instead improvised and improved constantly over time\u2014this is no exception. To make the pl\u00e1tanos maduros horneados, you\u2019ll need butter, brown sugar, and yellow plantains. You\u2019ll know your plantains are ready for this dish when they are more black than yellow and a tiny bit soft to the touch. They don\u2019t have to be fully black, but the more the better. Sometimes you can buy them already ripe; if not, you\u2019ll have to buy them in advance and let them ripen at home.Start by preheating your oven to 350\u00b0 and buttering your baking dish entirely. We use a 9x13\" baking dish (or simply a Pyrex, as my family calls it), but you can change the baking pan size depending on the amount you want to make or the number of plantains you\u2019re using. Peel the plantains\u2014it\u2019s easiest if you score them first by making shallow cuts down their lengths. You can place them whole in the buttered pan, but I slice them in half lengthwise\u2014it\u2019s just a matter of personal preference. You can also adjust the plantain size as needed to make them fit better in your baking pan.\u00a0To finish, sprinkle brown sugar all over the plantains (you need to use enough so that it can melt and caramelize) and bake until they are golden brown, anywhere from 1\u20131\u00bd hours. Oh, and if you are worried about too much brown sugar, don\u2019t be. I can guarantee you will not mess it up.Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesWe serve our pl\u00e1tanos maduros horneados straight out of the oven with a spoonful of either cream cheese or sour cream on the side. The generations-long debate of which dairy product goes best with this side dish is still up for discussion, but I know neither will disappoint.Melissa Paniagua is a freelance writer who loves green juice and coffee in equal measure.The more plantains, the better:Pi\u00f1onThis cheesy layered casserole is the ultimate sweet-and-savory mash-up, thanks to ground beef simmered with sofrito and tomato, melty mozzarella, and fried plantains to top it all off.\u00a0View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimplePlantainLatin AmericanRead MorecookingI\u2019ve Been Making Roti Jala Since I Was 10.
