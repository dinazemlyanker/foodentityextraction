It gets its striking color, freshness, and flavor from the addition of baby spinach and tender herbs (you can use the ones you have on hand\u2014a mix of dill and cilantro is especially nice) and turns into a complete meal with the addition of fatty smoked salmon. To achieve the fluffiest, puffiest pancake possible, make sure your eggs and milk are both at room temperature (pro tip: Bring your eggs up to temp fast by letting them sit in warm water for 5\u201310 minutes).All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I did use a lot of herbs, a mix of basil, dill and parsley. Added some onion powder and a little extra salt  to the pancake batter. Surprisingly impressed!Aileen Halifax, NS3/23/2022Half the spinach and add an addition half cup of herbs to get more of an herby flavor, I added chives into the mix in the original recipe and still didn't get any herbaceous flavors. A dollop of  creme fraiche was also defiantly needed. Audrey S3/21/2022I have a friend in Amsterdam who has a more exotic, albeit more simple, suggestion for making Dutch babies - -  if that's what you really want to do.snerdly fackleIsle of Skye3/20/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titBreakfastLunchDinnerMainWeeknight MealsEasyQuickHealthyishNut-FreeBakingSmoked SalmonSalmonFishSeafoodSpinachLeafy GreensVegetableDillHerbs & SpicesCilantroBasilParsleyRecipes you want to make.
