AnonymousVancouver, WA3/23/2022Super flavorful, and I opted for the spicy Italian sausage.  JaimeAustin, Texas2/9/2022Fantastic & easy to make meal.  We went back for seconds which is not the norm for us. Can\u2019t wait to make it againAnonymousRamsey, NJ9/22/2021Sounds great. I love cooking with peppery arugula and the lemon zest. G. HarveyLong Beach, CA9/14/2021@waynecheeky what a great suggestion!!!! DIANA THOMPSONBishop, CA5/11/2021Great recipe and so easy! It was a big hit in my house, everyone went back for seconds. Also delicious for leftovers (I add the arugula after heating up so it stays fresh).MorganneBoston, MA4/14/2021Solid recipe. I recommend deglazing with a bit of sambucca or pernod to really make the fennel pop.WaynecheekyNewark,OH2/22/2021Love how few pots and pans this dish uses, but next time might use an extra pan to cook the sausage on the stove. It gets pretty dry in the oven. Otherwise perfecto!!4everhungryOakland, Ca2/8/2021This was really good! Just make sure to season as you go. \n\nI used veggie (beyond) sausage, and it worked perfectly. I also topped it with a few dollops of fresh ricotta and it was a nice contrast. \n\nI made this for a week of lunches -- it is incredibly filling but doesn't make you sleepy :) AnonymousChampaign, IL 1/4/2021This is delicious as written and so easy. I also use this technique with whatever veggies I have on hand and sausage as a go-to weeknight dinner--squash, brussels sprouts, baby kale, spinach, whatever. It's probably best the way it's intended, but it's always good.AnonymousNY10/21/2020Sooooo good!  My husband said, \u201cI think this is the best pasta dish you\u2019ve ever made!\u201d  I used Jennie-O\u2019s sweet Italian turkey sausage and added a cup of peas.lorilHouston10/2/2020Sooooo gooooood!! Added extra lemon + red chili flakes for a sprinkle of danger.AnonymousChicago5/6/2020Great weeknight dinner.  Not a heavy pasta dish might skip the spicy sausage for artichoke heart and pepper flakes for heat!!  AnonymousCape Cod MA1/14/2020Delicious! Would also recommend to add a bit more lemon juice AnonymousCanada5/7/2019We love this pasta dish. I roast a pint+ of cherry or grape tomatoes with olive oil, salt and pepper for 15 minutes on 400*. I add this with sausage , vegetables and lemon. It all tastes wonderful!!AnonymousCanada4/29/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titPastaItalianEuropeanSausageMeatArugulaLeafy GreensVegetableRed OnionOnionEasyMainNut-FreeRoastSimmerDinnerRecipes you want to make.
