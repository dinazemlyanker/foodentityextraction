This Lobster PastaNot an ounce of lobstery goodness goes to waste.By Amiel StanekDecember 11, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Laura Murray, Food styling by Kat Boystova, prop styling by Allie WistFacebookTwitterEmailBon App\u00e9tit editor at large Amiel Stanek has spent years trying to help readers get dinner on the table as quickly and efficiently as possible. So when he gets to cook for himself, he likes to slow things down and be a little...extra. This is Not So Fast, a column dedicated to his favorite ingredient: time.Picture your three favorite people in the whole world. (And no, I\u2019m not talking about celebrity crushes; I mean people you actually know and know you back.) Wouldn\u2019t you love to make them something really, really special for dinner? A dish that shows them just how much you care, the kind of thing you would never in a million years cook for just any old friends\u2014a ride-or-dies-only sort of meal? Of course you would. Also: You should! And, also: You should make them lobster pasta.Why? Because lobster. Few words in the English language scream \u201cfaaaaaaaancy!\u201d with the same full-throated clarity, am I right? And as is the case with many other luxury-signaling food words, that has almost everything to do with the price tag attached to them. But the cool thing about these costly crustaceans is that unlike, say, truffles or caviar or foie gras, there are more and less expensive ways to eat them\u2014which is what this recipe is all about.I first encountered a version of lobster pasta some eight years ago flipping through The Art of Living According to Joe Beef. I was a broke-ass line cook living in Philadelphia, and was attracted to the Montreal restaurant\u2019s iconic Spaghetti Homard Lobster, first and foremost, for the ingenious thriftiness of the thing. And despite the fact that my financial situation has improved since then, I\u2019ve continued to make it at least once a year, tweaking it each time until it really felt like my own. It remains not only the most efficient and affordable way that I know of to enjoy lobster at home, but the most enjoyable as well.It\u2019s a math thing. On average, a lobster is only 20 percent meat by weight, which means the other 80 percent is shell. So, if you\u2019re thinking about the per-pound price of a live lobster in terms of the actual meat you\u2019re getting, then yeah: lobster is expensive AF. A boiled lobster dinner is expensive. A lobster roll is expensive. But if you can turn that other 80 percent, the parts that might otherwise be carelessly thrown away, into something flavorful and filling and imminently lobster-y\u2014well, then you\u2019d really be on to something, wouldn\u2019t you? And that is the beauty of lobster pasta: it cracks the code, allowing you to transform every last bit of the shellfish you paid so dearly for into maximum deliciousness.So, here\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do. You\u2019re going to buy a couple of live, pound-and-a-half Maine lobsters from the tank at the grocery store. (Buying four lobsters for dinner is a tall order. But buying two lobsters and turning them into a luxe dinner for four? That\u2019s more like it.) You\u2019re going to take them home and do them in the only way there is: steaming them in the biggest pot you\u2019ve got. And then, once you\u2019ve pulled them out and they\u2019re cool enough to touch, you\u2019re going to spread out some newspaper on your kitchen table, put on a podcast, and carefully extract every last bit of meat from those suckers without eating any of it as you go. (A true feat of dedication.) Then, once you\u2019re left with a shockingly small container of meat and a big ol\u2019 pile of shells and other detritus, you\u2019re going to break the hard parts into small pieces, sling them into a pot along with everything else (guts, goop, at all) and some aromatics, cover it all with heavy cream, and simmer every last bit of sweet lobster goodness out of them. Forty-five minutes later, all the solids get strained out and discarded, and what you\u2019re left with is a creamy, eye rollingly rich pasta sauce that tastes deeply lobstery, but even more deeply of love. All you\u2019ve got to do after that is boil some pasta, warm that reserved meat in the sauce, mix it all together with a bit of parm and serve it forth.Where\u2019s the lobster? You might think you yourself as you look down at the plate in front of you, a tangle of pasta studded with a few juicy morsels of pinkish-red meat. But once you\u2019ve twirled up that first forkful of noodles and popped it into your mouth, you\u2019ll understand immediately: The lobster is everywhere. Because of the work you put into that sauce, every corner of that platter is suffused with sweet, succulent shellfish flavor. The lobster tastes like lobster. The pasta tastes like lobster. The finger you use to swipe up the last bit of creaminess from your plate tastes like lobster. And that is the taste of a meal your realest ones won\u2019t soon forget.Get the recipe:Lobster PastaA creamy, eye rollingly rich pasta sauce that tastes deeply lobstery, but even more deeply of love.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titNot So FastHoliday 2019Recipes you want to make.
