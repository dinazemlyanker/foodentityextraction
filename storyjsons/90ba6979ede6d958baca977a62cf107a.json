It\u2019s a symbol of good luck, as the Mandarin word for fish sounds similar to the word for \u201chaving extra.\u201d Having fish every year means abundance will come your way, spilling over from one year to the next.Steaming a whole fish might seem intimidating, but I promise it\u2019s much easier than you think. Instead of using a steaming rack or basket, I cook the whole fish over a bed of onions, ginger, and scallions in a large lidded skillet. The big pile of aromatics not only flavors the fish, it also keeps it from touching the bottom of the pan without the need for a steaming rack. The onions become soft and jammy as the fish steams, resulting in plenty of fragrant broth to serve alongside. Serve the fish with steamed white rice, a rice dish (such as my Mushroom YouFan), or noodles. \u2014Jessie YuChenSee Jessie\u2019s recipes for Mushroom YouFan and Mochi-Stuffed Jujubes (Soft Hearts) to complete your Lunar New Year feast, and read about their favorite Lunar New Year traditions here.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt all over inside and outside of fish. Place a few slices from one 3\" piece ginger, peeled, thinly sliced, inside fish; set aside.Step 2Trim 1 large bunch scallions and cut into 3\"-long pieces; set white and pale green parts aside. Thinly slice dark green parts lengthwise. Place in a small bowl and pour in cold water to cover; set aside.Step 3Place 2 large onions, thinly sliced, in a large skillet with a lid, arranging so they cover the bottom of pan; drizzle 2 Tbsp. Kimlan dark soy sauce or regular soy sauce over and sprinkle 1 tsp. raw sugar or light brown sugar on top. Arrange remaining ginger in the middle of pan to form a bed, then line up reserved scallion white and pale green parts on top to form a rack. Pour in remaining \u00bc cup dry rice wine (such as michiu or sake) and \u00bc cup water, cover with lid, and set over high heat. Bring liquid in pan to a boil (you should see steam coming out of the sides of the pan), about 3 minutes. Uncover pan and quickly place reserved fish on top of scallions. Re-cover pan, reduce heat to medium-low, and steam fish until cooked through, 7\u20139 minutes.Step 4Meanwhile, heat 3 Tbsp. toasted sesame oil and 3 Tbsp. vegetable oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, until it's shimmering and just starting to smoke, about 4 minutes.Step 5Uncover fish and transfer to a platter (or serve directly in skillet). Scatter 5 garlic cloves, finely chopped, and 3 red Thai chiles, thinly sliced, on top of fish. Drain reserved dark parts of scallions and place on top of fish; carefully pour hot oil over (it will splatter).How would you rate Jessie\u2019s Special Steamed Whole Fish?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (1)Back to TopTriangleI've never written a recipe review in my life until now. It was so easy to make and I'm so overwhelmed by how flavourful and powerful all the flavours were. Definitely don't skimp out on the chiles and sesame oil.
