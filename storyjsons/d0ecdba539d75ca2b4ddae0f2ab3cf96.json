Preserved lemon, a pantry superstar if there ever was one, adds a brightness that cuts through the rich, stewy lentils. Because preserved lemons can vary in salt and acidity depending on the brand, you\u2019ll want to adjust the amount of salt and lemon accordingly. As for the herbs, dill and basil work especially well in this soup, but you can use any tender herbs you have on hand. And if the toppers feel too involved for a Wednesday night (I get it!), feel free to spoon over a bit of your favorite store-bought chili crisp instead. \u2014Zaynab IssaAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Hearty, interesting, versatile. I make daal a lot so this felt similar to me. I made it almost as written, except double the garlic (duh), and made it in my instant pot (15 high pressure then natural release). I felt like the amount of preserved lemon was just right, not overpowering. Finished with chopped cilantro. Would be good with a dollop of Greek yogurt. KatePortland OR3/9/2022Love all your recipes and have subscribed to the magazine for 30 years. This month's Red Lentil Soup and Spicy Shrimp Scampi are some of the best recipes ever. Your website and videos are wonderful tools, but please, please fix the print capability. For environmental reasons alone, the recipes need to be reduced to fit on only the space they need and actually print\u2013stripping out advertisements, pictures, videos, etc. This is done by other food websites so I know it can technically be done. I'm not the only avid supporter of your magazine who has expressed this opinion. Please help with this problem because it detracts from the professional nature of your website and  from our being able to purchase the ingredients and prepare the new, flavorful BonAppetit recipes! Jan V.Central Pennsylvania3/8/2022I liked this! It was infinitely better after sitting overnight. I do think the preserved lemon flavor got a bit lost in this and would increase it. I didn't find the garlic chips necessary, but really loved the Chilli oil and would double that next time. I only had dill so added some chopped green onion which was great! I'd would also consider mint  as an alternative. My biggest gripe was it was a bit too watery and I would probably reduce the stock to 6 cups next time. Alyssa Carson City, NV3/2/2022I love good recipes like this one but I am surprised when people publishing recipes don\u2019t know that extra virgin olive oil should not be cooked with. If anyone cares about their health, and I would think that people making these good recipes would be amount those people, it\u2019s well known in food science that extra virgin olive oil makes free radicals which are not good for us when heated. Lighter olive oil is what we should cook with, saving extra virgin olive oil only for dipping and finishing off a dish that\u2019s finished cooking, to add a little flavor. I\u2019ve seen this knowledge repeated by Italian cooks on food shows where they are in Italy, so it\u2019s not just American food science that  has published this for quite some time now. Cook with light olive oil for your heath. Save your extra virgin for dressings and dipping.\nAnonymousNJ2/27/2022I was surprised by the level of flavor that this soup had.  I'm used to making Turkish red lentil soup (mercimeck corba), but this seemed to really bring a depth of flavor.  \n\nI didn't have preserved lemon on hand, but diced a quarter of a fresh lemon and salted it, as well as a dried lime instead. \n\nCheese tortillas were a good pairing to make a full meal.
