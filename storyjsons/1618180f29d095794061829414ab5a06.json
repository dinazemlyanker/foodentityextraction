If you have really good homemade stock on hand, you can use it instead of the water called for here; the soup will only benefit from the addition. But even if you don\u2019t, the flavors will get richer and more concentrated the longer it sits, which means it\u2019s a great make-ahead recipe for a weekday lunch or dinner. This dish is part of the Bon App\u00e9tit Guide to Actually Enjoying Your Lunch at Work.

For those who find that it lacks flavor, two tips: 1. Add miso. 2.  Add Vegemite. I added a little of each; the flavor was outstanding.NancyFCalifornia2/23/2022Like others, I found the final product to be a little lackluster, so I decided to liven things up at the end with some fresh dill, a squeeze of lemon, lots of black pepper, and a swirl of olive oil, and that did the trick. Harissa or your favorite chili oil wouldn't hurt either. Though I didn't do it this time, if I make this again, I'll also deglaze with a little white wine. LauraChicago3/17/2021Quick and delicious! I used a bit less capers and veggie broth instead of water. I also deglazed the onions with white wine before adding the broth, I highly recommend this step. This will be a go-to recipe for me.KateNY2/8/2021Love this recipe, we make it with kale at least a few times a month. Broth or stock vs just water makes this delicious, and I always add 7-8 cups vs. the 6 they recommend. shivsChicago3/8/2020I made this with turkey stock and kale. Flavored broth/stock is a must, IMHO. Delicious, although I will use 7-7.5 c liquid next time. I wanted it to be brothier.nataliematz88Omaha, Ne12/8/2019Super Yummy to eat and easy to make as well. I need to eat gluten free so I made it with brown rice and it work very well.Anonymoustoronto11/19/2019After roasting and serving Cornish game hens (slathered inside and out with a lot of coarse ground mustard mixed with a lot of minced garlic and fresh rosemary) I simmered the bones for a few hours to make a rich broth.  I used that broth to make this soup, and it was delicious.  Not sure the flavor would have been as good with water as a base.  I think a rich vegetable broth would also work well as a substitute for water.AnonymousCharlotte, NC11/3/2019Really tasty and full of flavor. My attempt at it was not very \"soup-y\". It barely had any liquid left in it. Made a great lunch at my desk for the week though.AnonymousChicago10/22/2019Tasty and unusual soup, it\u2019s nice to try a new recipe. I did not deglaze with white wine, and found it quite flavorful. The farro had a nutty pleasant flavor, it was my first time using it in a recipe. I made it exactly as stated, but with baby kale instead of escarole. Thank you!AnonymousEllen10/18/2019Not flavorful at all! I used wine to deglaze, and used broth instead of water, and it still wasn't good. Disappointing. AnonymousLos Angeles10/14/2019Pretty good stuff. I made it with baby kale instead of escarole (lettuce? in my soup?). Never tried farro before so that was nice. The parm got a bit sticky - blending with an egg might help with that but I don't know. Definitely recommend using some type of stock, maybe adding a bit of thyme. I deglazed with white wine after sauteing the onions/garlic/shallot but that's only because I was drinking wine anyway. I like this recipe - good first soup of the fall, you can go your own way with it but it's also nice on its own.jesseranPhiladelphia10/10/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titSoupSoups and StewsItalianEuropeanFarroRice & GrainsEscaroleChicoryLeafy GreensVegetableCeleryFallEasyMainVegetarianNut-FreeSimmerLunchRecipes you want to make.
