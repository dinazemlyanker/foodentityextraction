Literally translating to \u201cnine sectional plates,\u201d gujeolpan consists of eight vegetable, meat, or seafood banchan (side dishes) that you can wrap in delicate crepe-like wheat pancakes. Byun first learned about the dish when he was researching Korean royal court cuisine while working as the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 at New York City\u2019s Atomix but didn\u2019t think to make it until he started Naemo.Together with chef Kyungbin Min of Hanchic in L.A.\u2019s Koreatown, he decided to reimagine gujeolpan with distinctly California ingredients (Meyer lemons!) and Korean cooking techniques (just look at that omelet) at Naemo. Byun\u2019s attention to detail is evident in every aspect of the pop-up.\u201cNaemo means \u2018square\u2019 in Korean. Here you have this square gujeolpan with square compartments, and it\u2019s being [rolled out] on Instagram, which is a grid of squares,\u201d Byun explains. \u201cEverything is very intentional.\u201dThe food is no exception. While eggs, beef, shrimp, mushrooms, carrots, bean sprouts, and cucumbers are often included in gujeolpan, there are no hard-and-fast rules. The focus is on the preparation and presentation: Each ingredient is cooked separately, lightly seasoned, and artfully arranged on a partitioned plate. To eat this gujeolpan, take the pink radish square, add your choice of fillings, roll, and enjoy. It also comes with roe-and-radish-topped bap (rice) and a seasonal guk (here, the soup is made from simmered ribs). With this fluidity in mind, Byun and Min let the Santa Monica farmers market serve as their inspiration.Here they break down how they take hyper-seasonal California produce and thoughtfully apply Korean flavors to create a gujeolpan for the 21st century.Jidan MariJidan is a classic Korean garnish, and typically in this rolled omelet, the egg whites and yolks are separated, lightly fried, and julienned for gujeolpan. Here they\u2019re layered with perilla and rolled up into the most eye-catching omelet instead.Mushroom MedleyMin loves this filling because it\u2019s got an element of surprise: Beneath the blanket of carrots are butter-saut\u00e9ed mushrooms (oyster, enoki, and shimeji).Myulchi Bokkeum (Anchovies)Min opts for humble stir-fried anchovies with dried shrimp and walnuts, but they\u2019re gilded with two nontraditional additions: Deglet Noor dates for sweetness and white borage flowers for a cucumber-like flavor.Spring Chaeso\u201cA salad in a Korean meal is so Korean American,\u201d Byun says. They flip the script on sweetly dressed romaine salads served at Korean barbecue restaurants with this radicchio one tossed with maesil wonaek (plum extract) and Meyer lemon.Moo SsamTraditionally, miljeonbyeong (wheat pancakes) are the centerpiece of gujeolpan and used as wraps for the eight banchan (side dishes). Min wanted to anchor the dish with something lighter and more refreshing: pretty-in-pink breakfast radishes pickled in rice vinegar.\u00a0Sigumchi NamulMin takes this banchan staple over the top by using gorgeously ridged Bloomsdale spinach and adding nutty, minty deulkkae (perilla seeds). \u201cYou get a nice little pop every time you take a bite,\u201d he says.Romanesco DubuWhile romanesco and tofu are Min\u2019s modern additions to gujeolpan, they help fulfill one of the platter\u2019s defining characteristics: the presentation of obangsaek, the five traditional Korean colors, which are white, black, red, yellow, and blue or green.Rib-Eye JorimBeef is customarily the most luxurious ingredient in gujeolpan. Min ups the ante by braising fatty rib eye and boiled quail eggs in his signature galbi sauce (his secret ingredients include cola, kiwi, and apple).Hobak MuchimMin blends the old and the new with condiments in this yellow squash dish. It gets an umami boost from guk-ganjang (a light soy sauce used in Korean cooking for centuries) and Yondu (a fermented vegetable extract invented in 2010).Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsDish DecodedRecipes you want to make.
