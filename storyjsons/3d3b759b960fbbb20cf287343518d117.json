If you\u2019ve cooked from the book or watched the show, you love Samin Nosrat. In fact, so many people do, she went to hide out in the desert. That didn\u2019t stop us from tracking her down.By Amanda ShapiroMarch 21, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailTo find Samin Nosrat, I drive northeast out of Palm Springs, past armies of wind turbines, sagging curio shops and Dollar Generals, cholla cacti and Seuss-like Joshua trees, and into what people here call the high desert. The Yucca Valley in Southern California is the kind of place you go if you don\u2019t want to be bothered by, say, strangers hugging you in grocery stores, screaming your name out car windows, inviting you on dates with them and their girlfriends, or asking to get coffee so they can \u201cpick your brain.\u201d\u201cPeople never used to look at me twice,\u201d Nosrat says, sitting on an overstuffed, over-pillowed couch in the bungalow she\u2019s rented for the month. \u201cThat was my superpower: When I met someone, I could decide whether to care about them based on whether they cared about me.\u201dA lot of people care about Nosrat now. I remember soon after her cookbook, Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat, came out in April 2017, a friend pressing it into my hands like something illicit. \u201cYou have to read this.\u201d Around the Bon Appe\u0301tit office her name wasn\u2019t Samin; it was \u201cSamiiiin [sigh].\u201d Then her four-episode cooking- and-travel show based on the book appeared on Netflix, and it seemed like everyone was talking about those soy-braised short ribs or that miso egg. My friends who didn\u2019t cook were posting photos of homemade focaccia. Something was happening.Today Nosrat\u2019s not only a James Beard Award\u2013winning darling of the food world, she\u2019s an internet meme (google \u201cSamin Nosrat Golden Girls\u201d; a think-piece subject (\u201c\u2018Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat\u2019 Is Marxist Fantasy Porn\u201d); and a person who gets tweets from Hollywood directors (\u201cA treat to watch you,\u201d wrote Ava DuVernay). She\u2019s verifiably mom-famous, as I learned when I texted mine a photo from the desert, and she texted back, oblivious, \u201cLooks like Samin Nosrat.\u201dI\u2019m here with Nosrat because I want to know what it\u2019s like to have a fairly quiet career in food for almost 20 years\u2014never running a restaurant, never appearing on Top Chef or any of those competition shows, just taking catering and teaching gigs as they came\u2014then, at almost 40, become a full-blown food celebrity. I want to know why so many of us have fallen so hard for her at a time when we\u2019re saturated with food content on every platform, when, on any given night, you can binge-watch more than 100 episodes of The Great British Baking Show or tune in to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez making soup on Instagram Live. Why Samin? Why now?\u201dThat was my superpower: When I met someone, I could decide whether to care about them based on whether they cared about me.\u201dFull and obvious disclosure: I love Samin Nosrat as much as you probably do. I\u2019ve watched the show and cooked the short ribs and read through Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat like it was the fifth Ferrante novel. When we meet, I feel like we\u2019ve already spent time together. Her curly black hair is flecked with gray, her hands and forearms marked by cooking burns. The denim jumpsuit she\u2019s wearing is missing a button; it popped off that morning while she was trying to pee.Before the trip I pictured us in her cute kitchen making some delicious braise-y or bread-y thing, but I soon learn\u2014and this will totally weird you out and maybe annoy you\u2014Nosrat is doing a cleanse. And not just any cleanse; she\u2019s doing a Gwyneth Paltrow cleanse (or at least the one that Gwyneth\u2019s doctor friend, Alejandro Junger, sells). It involves drinking these premixed shakes for breakfast and dinner, and, for lunch, eating basically vegetables and seeds, and doing all that for 21 days straight.Okay, but hear her out: December was rough. She did a ten-day press tour that took everything out of her; then the holidays hit. Physically, psychically, and digestively, Nosrat was wrecked. She decided that while she cleansed her mind in the desert she would cleanse her body too. She\u2019s been on the diet for two weeks by the time I arrive, and she feels incredible. \u201cI don\u2019t even think about my digestion,\u201d she says, awestruck.So instead of cooking, Nosrat and I drive to a date farm that she\u2019s known about since she was 19 and working at Chez Panisse, Alice Waters\u2019 iconic Berkeley restaurant, where these particular dates are still on the menu. From her Subaru Impreza, Nosrat tells Siri to text her literary agent, Kari Stuart: \u201cAre we millionaires yet?\u201d Then she laughs as only Nosrat does, like a fire hydrant bursting at full blast.Nosrat is not a millionaire yet, but she'll get a lot closer in March, when she'll sell her second cookbook, What to Cook, to Ten Speed Press for an undisclosed amount, but more than her first book. (Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat sold to Simon & Schuster in 2013 after a bidding war among virtually every major publisher. Nosrat says, \u201cIt was the biggest deal for a first-time cookbook author I\u2019d ever heard of.\u201d As of February the book has sold 330,000 copies, which, for what it\u2019s worth, is more than three times what Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s 2016 cookbook sold.)How Nosrat roasts beets: In a cast-iron skillet with a little water and covered in foil so they steam while they cook.\nPhoto by Alex LauOn the way to the farm, we stop at a vegan cafe\u0301 for a cleanse-approved lunch\u2014a salad with black beans called Coachella Forever\u2014before arriving at a driveway with a small wooden sign reading \u201cFlying Disc Ranch.\u201d A woman in an L.A. Angels cap comes out to introduce herself as Christina Kelso, the farm\u2019s second-in-command.\u201cYou\u2019re on that show, right?\u201d she says to Nosrat, smiling shyly.We walk the grassy paths that run between rows of gnarled date palms as the late-day sun filters in, and I feel like I\u2019m on Nosrat\u2019s show. As she does with the Italian olive producers in the \u201cFat\u201d episode and at the Japanese salt factory in \u201cSalt,\u201d Nosrat peppers Kelso with questions: How do you harvest? When do you drive to market? How does pollination work?We go into a packing room where hundreds of dates sit in cardboard boxes: fat, squishy Medjools; skinny, honey-colored Deglet Noors; yellow-ish Zahidis. Nosrat moans as she bites into a round, thin-skinned date, so I follow her lead. The flesh dissolves in my mouth like a caramel cloud. \u201cIt\u2019s called a Barhi,\u201d Nosrat tells me. Kelso glows. Nosrat buys an obscene amount of dates, Kelso undercharges, Nosrat overpays, there are hugs all around, and scene.By this point I\u2019ve nailed down one obvious reason why you and I and my mom and your dentist all love Samin Nosrat: She really wants you to love her, and she has an uncanny, non- smarmy ability to get you to do just that. \u201cLuckily, as a brown woman, I\u2019ve had a lifetime of training making other people feel comfortable,\u201d she says. For a long time Nosrat hated that she was such a people pleaser, but now she sees it as her greatest strength.It got her through high school in the richest, whitest part of San Diego as the daughter of middle-class Iranian immigrants. It got her a job that involved vacuuming the floors at Chez Panisse when she was a student at UC Berkeley. It helped her at Eccolo, the seasonal Italian Berkeley restaurant where she was first a line cook and then a sous-chef, and at catering gigs for celebrities and moneyed Bay Area families she\u2019d met through Chez Panisse. It\u2019s why Michael Pollan let her audit his wait-listed writing class in 2007 and then hired her to be his cooking teacher when he was writing his book Cooked in 2013. It\u2019s why the editor who would go on to acquire Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat in 2013 wrote her a letter begging to let him publish the book after meeting her once. It\u2019s how she managed to write about protein strands and coagulation in a way that made hundreds of thousands of people want to roast a chicken. It\u2019s why everyone she meets on her Netflix show\u2014even the most skeptical honey producers in the Yucata\u0301n\u2014can\u2019t help but smile when she\u2019s around.And it\u2019s why, upon learning that I have a thing for hitting up health food stores in random places, Nosrat drives me to three different ones in the Yucca Valley.\u201cMy friends in tech talk about the \u2018user experience,\u2019\u201d she says as we drive back to the high desert with our cassava-flour tortillas and liters of kombucha in the back, the Joshua trees casting long, strange shadows across the road. \u201cAnd I realized I\u2019ve been thinking that way my whole life.\u201dThe desert gods shine fortune upon me: A photo shoot is scheduled for the next day, meaning I will get to watch Nosrat cook. When I show up at her house the next morning, she\u2019s in black overalls and a pink T-shirt, washing beets to roast for a citrus salad. \u201cI\u2019ve cooked beets a million ways, but this way is the best because they steam while they roast,\u201d she says, pouring a little water into the skillet with the beets and covering it with aluminum foil.A citrus salad with the perfect balance of, yes, salt, fat, acid, and heat.\nPhoto by Alex LauShe engages with the photographer like someone who, well, has hosted cooking shows. \u201cDo you want me to stop plating?\u201d she asks, spoon in hand. \u201cShould I do that part again?\u201d she asks, rubbing a citrus vinaigrette into sliced cucumbers.Nosrat is the first to point out that there are chefs who are much more technically skilled than she is; she\u2019s friends with a lot of them. But most chefs aren\u2019t as comfortable in front of the camera, nor are they good at teaching us normal people how to do what they do. She calls me over to watch how she segments a grapefruit, cutting the thin membranes aside with a tiny paring knife and letting each perfect half-moon drop to the plate. She hands me the knife so I can try. After a few botched attempts, I successfully carve out a decent slice and she cheers.Nosrat abandoned two other book projects and dozens of ideas before Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat. But, at 39, she says she wouldn\u2019t have wanted her success to come any earlier. \u201cI\u2019m so glad that I\u2019ve had so much disappointment and can see so clearly,\u201d she says. \u201cTwenty years ago, I would\u2019ve been swept up.\u201dMaybe Nosrat wasn\u2019t ready then, but I don\u2019t think the world was ready for Nosrat either. When Nosrat was 19, Emeril Lagasse was \u201cBAM\u201d-ing every which way and Alton Brown was explaining the science behind cast-iron pans on the Food Network. When she was 29, reality shows had swallowed TV, and Top Chef, Chopped, and Next Food Network Star had turned cooking into pure entertainment.\u201cI\u2019m so glad that I\u2019ve had so much disappointment and can see so clearly. Twenty years ago, I would\u2019ve been swept up.\u201dNosrat\u2019s success signals a new era of food celebrity. Reality TV has been eclipsed by programming that\u2019s weirder (see amateur bakers making horrific mistakes on Nailed It!), wilder (see Bon Appe\u0301tit\u2019s own Brad Leone pheasant hunting on YouTube), and truly real (see your friend documenting her sourdough journey on Instagram), and none of these examples are on what used to be referred to as TV. As food \u201ctelevision\u201d has fractured across so many platforms, the most resonant hosts today have two things in common: They\u2019re magnetic without seeming media-savvy, and they\u2019re often home cooks, not restaurant chefs.Doris Cooper, a cookbook editor at Clarkson Potter for 13 years who works with writers like Alison Roman and Melissa Clark, sees a similar trend. \u201cCookbooks a decade ago were celebrity chefs. They were either famous because they were on the Food Network or because they helmed an important or popular restaurant,\u201d she says. In comparison, \u201cthe books doing so beautifully right now are written by people who are exalting home cooking. They\u2019re in a small kitchen. They don\u2019t have four appliances.\u201d Nosrat fits the bill: She takes press photos leaning in the doorway because her kitchen is so small. Her cookbook is a compendium of times she messed up: undersalting the polenta, cramming too many zucchini slices on a sheet tray.But if home cooking is having a renaissance, it\u2019s not the kind that promises 30-minute meals or sings the praises of semi-homemade. Instead it feels like a return to an even earlier era, the one where Julia Child first showed Americans how to make beef bourguignon. Today our favorite cooks are again challenging us to tackle classics\u2014sourdough, a whole roast chicken, or the perfect vinaigrette\u2014in a totally down-to-earth, far-from-perfect way. \u201cThe best way to execute French cooking is to get good and loaded and whack the hell out of a chicken\u201d could\u2019ve been a quote from Nosrat if Child hadn\u2019t supposedly said it first.Nosrat cooked sweet potatoes in the coals of an outdoor stove, then topped them with an herby, zesty chimmichurri.\nPhoto by Alex LauThe night before the James Beard Media Awards in 2018, Nosrat was at a gathering of Netflix talent at a bar in Manhattan. Her cookbook had been nominated for the food equivalent of Best Picture (it would win the next night), and she was already feeling celebratory. Nosrat doesn\u2019t really drink, so she was feeling...emboldened after glass of wine number two, which is when she told her producers she had to go talk to a guy at the end of the table. The guy was Brian McGinn, the director of Chef\u2019s Table, the Netflix show that Nosrat and others have been critical of for its rapturous portrayals of white male chefs. Nosrat scooted down the table and reached for his hand. \u201cI need to say something to you,\u201d she told McGinn. \u201cYou have to do better.\u201dSince the 2016 election, and as waves of #MeToo allegations have crashed over the industry, chefs have become more politically vocal. But Nosrat\u2019s been an activist for much longer, and not just on Twitter. She\u2019s raised more than $150,000 through bake sales for various disaster relief efforts in the Bay Area. She connected restaurant employees who\u2019d been harassed with journalists. She\u2019s refused invitations to events that don\u2019t include chefs of color or that relegate them to panels on \u201cethnic\u201d food.\u201cI\u2019m literally the only brown person ever who\u2019s been given the privilege of talking about general cooking,\u201d she says, and she doesn\u2019t mean just on panels. In every pocket of the food industry, from television to cookbooks to restaurant kitchens, non-white chefs have been pigeonholed into cooking only food that\u2019s associated with their culture. When food writer Nik Sharma was trying to sell his cookbook, Season, to publishers, they\u2019d see his name and assume it was an Indian cookbook. \u201cThere was often this notion that I should be writing about India,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018How many stories on chicken curry do you need from me?\u2019\u201dMaybe because she got her start at the most-well known restaurant for California cuisine, Nosrat was never branded as a Persian chef. Instead her expertise is her technique: Here\u2019s how to salt your pasta water (heavily); here\u2019s how to roast vegetables (spread them out!); here\u2019s how to make focaccia (olive oil, olive oil, more olive oil). On the show she usually plays the student, eager to touch, taste, and ask questions. But rather than big-name restaurant chefs, her teachers are miso masters in Japan, literal grandmas in Mexico, her own mother. She\u2019s endlessly curious about who they are and what they do, then she brings their wisdom home to us, the viewers, and quietly, one scene at a time, we see what a less racist, less sexist, more egalitarian food world might look like.\u201cI\u2019m literally the only brown person ever who\u2019s been given the privilege of talking about general cooking.\u201dEarlier in the day I\u2019d admired a microfiber towel in Nosrat\u2019s bathroom made for people with curly hair. So when the shoot wraps, Nosrat insists on taking me to Marshalls so I can buy one for myself. It\u2019s maybe the most excited I\u2019ve seen her in the 48 hours we\u2019ve spent together. \u201cIt\u2019s the best Marshalls I\u2019ve ever been to,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to freak out.\u201dIt\u2019s truly a very good Marshalls, well-organized and bright but not head-achingly so. She leaves me in the hair-care aisle and takes a phone call, this time about mortgages.Nosrat believes in making things happen by asking for them: the job at Chez Panisse when she was 19, the seat in Michael Pollan\u2019s class. She even wrote a letter to the New York Times in 2013 asking to be a contributing food columnist and, okay, no one responded, but six years later she is exactly that. Just last summer she wrote in her manifestation journal (yes, she has a manifestation journal) that she wanted a house with a kitchen big enough for a film crew to shoot in, with a door leading out to a garden and a separate space for food prep. A few months later a friend told her about a house with every single one of those things. Yeah, she bought the house.Nosrat has built her career on helping people feel more comfortable in the kitchen.\nPhoto by Alex LauNosrat doesn\u2019t have to ask for much anymore. She can do what she wants, and she has a lot of ideas: a production company that would fund brown people\u2019s projects. A mentoring program where she helps people of color get book deals. A documentary about Edna Lewis, the legendary Southern cook. She\u2019ll write another book, and she\u2019ll probably shoot another TV show, as soon as she figures out what stories she wants to tell. She can hide out in the desert for another month.But right now she wants to give away popcorn. She bought a popcorn maker at Bed Bath & Beyond (Marshalls doesn\u2019t stock them) and she\u2019s going to set it up at La Copine, the one trendy restaurant for miles, and offer hippie toppings like nutritional yeast, and the weekenders from L.A. will eat the popcorn while they wait for a table. She\u2019s doing it for fun but also for donations; the restaurant needs a new oven and she wants to help.I don\u2019t know anything about professional ovens, but they sound expensive, like more than a few days of popcorn donations. Then I remember who I\u2019m talking to. If Samin Nosrat tells people they want popcorn, they\u2019ll believe her, and they\u2019ll come.Explore Bon App\u00e9titChefsCelebrity ChefsRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
