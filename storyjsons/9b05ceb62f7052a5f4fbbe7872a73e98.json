Next up is Kelis, singer, organic farm owner, and hot sauce entrepreneur.Kelis told us years ago that her milkshake brought all the boys to the yard, but these days the singer-chef is hawking a spicy aji verde and pineapple saffron glaze. Her hot sauce brand Bounty & Full, founded in 2015, is driven by the belief that \u201ceverything is better smothered, dipped or poured.\u201d\u201cFood is revolutionary because it is the one and only international language,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the most human thing you can partake in. We are the only species that cooks.\u201dKelis graduated from Le Cordon Bleu in 2008, but credits her mother for inspiring her love affair with food. \u201cI remember going to Puerto Rico and my mom would take us to the beach where we\u2019d find these little huts. They\u2019d make alcapurrias, papas rellenas and more, all filled with seafood. I remember eating them till we were stuffed,\u201d she recalls. Fittingly, her 2014 album Food included songs titled Friday Fish Fry and Jerk Ribs.Since her cooking-school days, Kelis has written a book called My Life on a Plate: Recipes From Around the World, hosted specials on the Cooking Channel, and served up everything from jerk ribs to turkey curry burgers on her YouTube channel, Bounty Tube.  This year, she became co-owner of Bounty Farms in Quindio, Colombia. The sustainable farm grows coffee, tomatoes, and other produce, and is expected to open to the public some time in 2021. \u201cMy goal with the farm is to regain control of how we eat and reconnect ourselves with the food we love,\u201d she says.We talked to Kelis about the flavors she can\u2019t get enough of, the best meal she\u2019s ever had, and why making healthy food accessible to all is her life\u2019s mission.My favorite flavor to dip things in is\u2026 hot sauce. Bounty & Full\u2019s TheTruth hot sauce to be specific. Also aji\u2026I\u2019m obsessed! I think spice brings excitement, and aji is the perfect addition to a good piece of meat.The best meal I\u2019ve ever had was\u2026 on the island of Penang in Malaysia.  Years ago when I went to Penang I came across this food cart\u2014I wouldn\u2019t say I stalked the owner but I ended up buying food from him every day while I was out there. He made a roti tisu that was sweet and crunchy and everything you wanted it to be with a super creamy spicy curry. He didn\u2019t speak English or have any teeth but he knew I loved every single bite. There's also a place in a train station in Hong Kong that has some of the best buns and dim sum that I\u2019ve ever had. If I\u2019m not mistaken, I heard they got a Michelin star.I feel joy when... I am able to give my kids something new to try and see their reaction. My youngest, Shepherd, was determined to try my sparkling water. I knew he wouldn\u2019t like it because of the bubbles, but seeing it take over his taste buds and reaction was priceless. My oldest, Knight, once told me he wasn\u2019t a fan of oxtail because he \u201cwasn\u2019t a fan of the texture\u201d. Seeing them react and understand new food is amazing.Three things always in my kitchen cabinet are\u2026 cookies, for my husband and boys specifically. They are literally cookie monsters. Lots of grains, oatmeal, rice, popcorn. And of course loads of coffee from Colombia.I\u2019d like to cook for\u2026 good eaters, not picky eaters. Every time I cook it\u2019s a full feast. It doesn\u2019t matter who I\u2019m cooking for as long as they are happy, hungry, and ready to eat. I love an eater and I love to see their reaction to eating my food.I just finished reading\u2026 Lost Tribes & Promised Lands by Ronald Sanders. Super interesting, very informative, definitely a page-turner. I\u2019m a real history lover, and reading is one of my favorite things to do.Food justice is\u2026 healthy food for everyone. You shouldn\u2019t have to pay more for something organic or fresh. Everything that goes into our body affects us. Everyone should be able to prepare and enjoy food that actually nourishes the body and keeps us healthy. I\u2019d like to see more places do farm to table.I\u2019m listening to\u2026 Bill Withers. I\u2019m currently going through a silent period, but when I do listen to music, it\u2019s definitely something classic like Bill Withers, Hector Lavoe, or Biggie.I\u2019m inspired by\u2026 most the things around me. I\u2019m kinda a sponge. I\u2019m inspired by bravery and guts, human will, resistance, and seeing a strong woman accomplish things.A good day looks like\u2026 rain all day! I have nothing to do, I have a great book, wonderful things to eat and drink, and my phone is broken.Explore Bon App\u00e9titPerson of InterestHealthyishHot SauceInterviewsRead MorecultureWhy Indie Rapper Junglepussy Wrote a Song About Trader Joe'sBy Martine ThompsonRecipes you want to make.
