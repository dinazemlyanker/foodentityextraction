(There's no need to smash the butter to smithereens\u2014it\u2019s those large pieces that make for a flaky pastry!) Use it for our Butternut Squash Tarte Tatin and Glazed and Flaky Apple Tart. When it comes out of the oven and you experience how buttery and light it tastes, you'll be amazed that you made it yourself.IngredientsMakes 26 oz.2Tbsp. sugar1\u00bdtsp. kosher salt2\u00bdcups all-purpose flour, plus more for surface1\u00bccups (2\u00bd sticks) chilled unsalted butterPreparationStep 1Whisk sugar, salt, and 2\u00bd cups flour in a large bowl to combine. Grate \u00bd cup butter on the large holes of a box grater directly into bowl (work quickly so the butter doesn\u2019t soften too much in your hands).Photo by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiStep 2Thinly slice remaining \u00be cup butter and add to bowl. Toss to coat butter, then quickly smash slices with your fingers into smaller, flatter pieces.Photo by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiStep 3Gradually drizzle in 7 Tbsp. ice water, tossing constantly with a fork to distribute. Using your hands, knead dough a couple of times in bowl to bring together in large clumps. Transfer clumps to a piece of plastic wrap, leaving dry bits behind. Toss dry bits in bowl, drizzling in more ice water by the teaspoonful as needed, until they hold together when squeezed in your hand (it will be very dry, which is normal).Step 4Add to dough on plastic and wrap tightly, forming into a 6\" square. Flatten, pushing dough into corners and pressing out any air pockets. Chill 2 hours.ChevronChevronStep 5Let dough sit at room temperature about 4 minutes to soften. Roll out on a lightly floured surface into a long rectangle about \u00bc\" thick.Photo by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiStep 6Fold into thirds like a letter and rotate 90\u00b0. Repeat rolling and folding process, dusting with more flour as needed. Rewrap tightly and chill at least 30 minutes before using.ChevronChevronStep 7Do Ahead: Dough can be made 2 days ahead.

I've made pot pie crust and plum hand pies from these, and both came out wonderfully-- especially with an egg wash before putting it in.Anonymous10/5/2021Made some very delicious (if dry, but I think that was on me!) croissants with this puff pastry recipe.
