If you can\u2019t find pancetta, slab bacon can be used in its place but will add a smoky flavor to the finished dish.Almonds, Anchovies, and Pancetta by Cal Peternell with Permission from William Morrow Cookbooks, 2018Ingredients4 servings1Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil8oz. pancetta, cut into 1\u00bd\" pieces12garlic cloves, unpeeled\u00bdcup dry white wine2bunches kale, mustard greens, and/or collard greens, stems removed, leaves coarsely choppedKosher saltPreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 450\u00b0. Heat oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium. Cook pancetta, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and wine, increase heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer. Add enough water to just cover pancetta (about 2 cups), return to a simmer, then transfer pan, uncovered, to oven. Immediately reduce oven temperature to 325\u00b0. Roast, adding more water if pan looks too dry, until pancetta is very tender and garlic is softened, 60\u201370 minutes.Step 2Carefully pluck out garlic and let cool slightly.

A great way to get a load of greens in, with a ton of flavour from the pork and garlic. I also always peel my garlic so I can skip the peeling. \n\nWill probably be able to cook this from heart soon enough. AnonymousToronto, ON.11/26/2021Really yummy! I doubled the greens using lacinato kale, mustard greens, and chard. Used finely chopped pancetta since that's what I had and reduced braising time to 50 minutes. Will definitely make again!AnonymousBay Area, California10/16/2020Gave pork belly a dry rub due to lack of pancetta. I think turning on convection in oven to make meat crispy will be faster than having to wait 60-70 min. Used minced garlic which had a nice smoked flavor since being in the skillet for so long. Didn't use that much water but still came out great.ok42dayBay Area4/28/2020I love this recipe. It has all the flavor of a comfort food and is loaded with greens. Goes beautifully with crusty bread for smearing the garlic onto. chelseaalyonsChicago, IL4/15/2020this is a great cold-weather meal with some crusty bread (cheese toasties, anyone?) and a board game IMO. FYI Cal\u2019s cookbook instructs you to cook the greens separately, but I personally think cooking them in the braising liquid is better! the whole garlic cloves are so flavorful. I added lots of freshly ground black pepper. if you\u2019re worried about fat/oil (if your pancetta is especially fatty), pour some of it out before adding the wine and garlic. chelseaalyonsChicago, IL10/9/2019The recipe on its own makes for a very oily dish as the fat from the pancetta and olive oil are cooked together create a lot of excess oil. It also doesn't have a lot of flavor on its own, but adding a little chicken broth in replacement of the water helped create more body.
