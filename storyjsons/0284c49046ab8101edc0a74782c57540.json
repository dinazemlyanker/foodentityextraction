Any noodles you have on hand will work (even spaghetti) and if bitter broccoli rabe isn\u2019t your thing, swap in your favorite hearty leafy green. For a balanced, spicy kick, Issa suggests using O\u2019Food or Mother-in-Law\u2019s brand gochujang.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I have swapped coconut aminos for the soy sauce, nut butter for the tahini and it was still awesome. Only hard staple to me are the gochujang and sesame oil, don't leave those out. My boyfriend LOVES this recipe. Clean plate and seconds every time.FaithHouston, TX3/22/2022Super spicy and so flavorful. I squeezed half a lime over the finished dish, rather than serve with wedges, and next time will use more lime juice. Peanuts would be a nice addition and, yes, there is so much to play with here. This was delicious. nilssonsBoston, MA3/20/2022Quick, tasty, easily riffable recipe. I added mushrooms and snap peas, could add ground pork, fish sauce, peanuts, etc. Great template for any time you want some spicy noodles!
