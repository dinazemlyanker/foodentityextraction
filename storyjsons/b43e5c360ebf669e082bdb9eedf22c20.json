Here I swapped out the ground nuts of a classic linzer for tahini, yielding a rich, buttery crust. It\u2019s filled with jam, topped with more dough, and cut into big, unbreakable bars. One of these would\u2019ve gotten me at least a couple packs of Dunkaroos back in the day\u2014if I felt compelled to trade at all.\u201d Unlike a truly woven lattice, this fake version uses strips of dough simply laid on top of each other. Don\u2019t worry if they break\u2014just press them back together and they will fuse as they bake.IngredientsMakes 12\u00becup (1\u00bd sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more for pan3cups (375 g) all-purpose flour\u00betsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt\u00bdtsp. baking powder\u00betsp. ground cinnamon\u00bctsp. ground cardamom2large eggs1cup (200 grams) granulated sugar\u2154cup high-quality tahini, stirred well1tsp. vanilla extractSesame seeds (for sprinkling)1\u00bccups jam of choiceRaw sugar (for sprinkling)PreparationStep 1Lightly butter a 13x9\" baking dish, then line with a sheet of parchment paper, leaving overhang on long sides. Lightly butter parchment. Whisk flour, salt, baking powder, cinnamon, and cardamom in a medium bowl.Step 2Separate yolk from 1 egg over a small bowl to catch egg white. Place yolk in another small bowl; set egg white aside for brushing dough. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat granulated sugar, tahini, and 1\u00bd sticks butter in a large bowl, scraping down sides of bowl as needed, until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add vanilla, egg yolk, and remaining egg and beat just to combine. Scrape down sides of bowl, add dry ingredients, and mix on low speed until just combined. Scrape half of dough into prepared pan. Using your fingers, press into pan in an even layer, going 1\" up the sides; chill.Step 3Place remaining dough on a sheet of parchment paper and pat into a square. Place another sheet of parchment paper on top and roll into a 13x9\" rectangle. Remove top sheet of parchment and generously sprinkle dough with sesame seeds. Replace parchment and press dough gently with rolling pin to help seeds stick. Remove parchment and cut dough lengthwise into \u00be\"-wide strips (don\u2019t pull them apart; dough will be very fragile). Slide onto a baking sheet and freeze until solid, about 2 hours.Step 4Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0. Spread jam evenly over dough in pan. Lightly beat reserved egg white with a fork, then brush all over frozen strips of dough. Retrace cuts to make sure strips are separated, then lay lengthwise over filling (spacing them about \u00bd\" apart works well). Cut remaining strips in half and place crosswise on top of strips, pressing into edge of bottom crust (you may not use all of the strips).Step 5Brush lattice once more with egg white and sprinkle generously with raw sugar. Bake until crust is deeply browned all over and jam is bubbling in places, 40\u201345 minutes. Let linzer torte cool in pan, then use parchment to lift out onto a cutting board and slice into 12 squares.How would you rate Tahini Linzer Torte Bars?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (14)Back to TopTriangleThere is absolutely not enough fat in this recipe for it to work. No wondering it's a failure for so many reviewers. \n\nMaida Hatter's linzer torte has a pound's worth of ground nuts and 2 1/2 sticks of butter for the same amount (3 cups of flour). This needs almost double the amount of tahini and another stick of butter in order for it to work. \n\nThankfully I know how to make proper linzer torte and could fix this. Looks like many people were not. MattDE8/21/2021I wish I'd read the negative reviews first. These were not good. Not a disaster -- technically, the recipe \"works\" \u2013 but the flavor is very hollow and sweet and the textures don't gel. I made these as a gift but I will be putting them in the community donation fridge instead and making something else. A wasted expense on great tahini and jam...I'd like that $25 back.\n\nOddly, I tried to rate these one star and the BA website won't let me select anything but 5.DisappointedBrooklyn, NY4/25/2021The person from Honolulu found the issue with these cookies, and I believe the editors incorrectly updated the web version. The magazine version does list 1.5 STICKS of butter in the ingredients list and 1.5 CUPS in the instructions. At the time of writing this review, the web version indicates 1.5 sticks in both the ingredients and the instructions. I\u2019m guessing 1.5 cups was correct - these came out incredibly dry with 1.5 sticks - basically more like a crumb topping, though it did eventually sort of come together. I\u2019m going to try it again with more butter. They\u2019re tasty though, as long as you use good tahini. If you use that Joyva roasted tahini crap that comes in a can at the supermarket, they\u2019ll probably also taste like crap. I used Soom tahini. Also felt like it needed more cardamom - I used closer to 3/4 teaspoon. I also didn\u2019t have enough dough to go 1 inch up the sides, but it doesn\u2019t matter if you use a thicker spreadable fruit butter. DanielaPhiladelphia, PA3/2/2021I really wanted to like these as I prefer complex flavors. But they ended up being a waste of quality raspberry jam and tahini. I wish I had halved the recipe as I will definitely NOT be gifting these to anyone. (I threw a few in my freezer for breakfast options, and pitched the rest. No-one in my family liked them, and we rarely agree on anything.) The sweet and salty moon pies in this issue were a hit, as were the brown butter and pistachio sables.Nancy OArlington, VA2/6/2021I used a decent quality fig jam (inspired by the fig newton comment in the headnote) and woooow these were so good! I've never made anything like this before so the lattice and gigantic strips of dough were a bit strange to work with, but it did turn out looking mostly like the picture and my parents were pretty impressed. I actually enjoyed eating these bars for breakfast the most since they weren't overly sweet!SarahNJ12/31/2020It was my first time baking Linzer Torte, so I have no pre-conceived notion about this recipe.  In fact, this recipe triggered my curiosity on the original Linzer Torte, which I'll plan to make soon. Overall, it's a good recipe.  As mentioned in the intro of the recipe, the tahini makes it nice, flaky and buttery.  I used home-made Cranberry Chutney, so it has an Indian twang to it.  I think any tart jam will go well with this pastry mix.  I would do away with the ground cardamon though because it overwhelms the tahini and if you aren't used to cardamon, the flavor could be a little off-putting.  The tart keeps well in the freezer in an air-tight container.  I would take one piece at a time, pop it in a microwave for 40 seconds and put a scoop of ice cream on top.  Yummy!\nPS.  Thumbs down for those nasty reviewers.  Don't need to be mean or rude if it doesn't work out for you.  Just be constructive and informative. NatalieCincinnati, OH12/29/2020No. These were a pain to make and not remotely worth the time. I used high-quality raspberry preserves, but that wasn\u2019t enough to offset the thick, bland dough. Tasted like sweetened sand pies. I was going to give these as gifts, but...I\u2019d only feed these to my sworn enemies.Minky12/25/2020so good!! used raspberry jam. love the flavors. the lattice kept falling apart on me but I gently pushed it back together once in the pan and the finished product ended up looking gorgeous. I did have leftover lattice so if your base crust seems like it needs some more dough, you can definitely take a few pinches from the lattice half.danielleChicago12/22/2020These are delicious, but there is not enough dough to make these 1\u201d up the sides of the rimmed sheet pan and have enough for the lattice as called. Emily S.Los Angeles, CA12/14/2020Note! The recipe directions mention 1-1/2 CUPS of butter, but the ingredients list 1-1/2 STICKS. I\u2019m going to go by the list, but it needs to be corrected! AndreaHonolulu12/13/2020These are ... really good. Followed recipe as directed except had no cardamom so used some ginger and nutmeg, and used raspberry jam. They are light, fluffy, and flavorful. They feel like extra fancy PB&J's!DianeBrooklyn12/12/2020I am afraid to waist the ingredients and not like the taste of tahini.  Is it over powering or do they taste like linzer squares should?AnonymousNJ12/7/2020I think that vegetable shortening or a vegan butter substitute would be best if you're trying to make these without dairy!Anonymous12/3/2020This looks amazing - but what would be a good dairy free/lactose free substitute for butter to mix with the tahini? Can I use veg. shortening? Or oil? \n\nAnonymousMadison, WI12/3/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titCookieDessertBar CookieTahiniCondiments, Sauces & PastesSnackBakingChristmasRecipes you want to make.
