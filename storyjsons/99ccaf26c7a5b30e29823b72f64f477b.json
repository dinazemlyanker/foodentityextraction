And then you remember that just last week, you made focaccia that required no kneading at all.So what\u2019s the point? And do you really need to do it for 10 entire minutes? I\u2019m answering all of your kneading questions below:What does kneading do?Before you understand kneading, you\u2019ve gotta understand gluten. When you mix wheat flour and water together, the proteins in the flour combine to form a gluten network. This structure is what gives bread dough the strength and elasticity to capture all the bubbles and burbles produced by yeast in order to grow fluffy, chewy, and light when baked.This magic happens all on its own, and for some breads (like focaccia) all you need is enough water and time to develop a strong gluten network. But other doughs, like the one for the Cinnamon-Date Sticky Buns, need some help to get there\u2014and that help comes in the form of kneading.The amount of time you\u2019re asked to knead the dough depends on its hydration level and the characteristics of the final product. When you knead you\u2019re not only developing the gluten, but you\u2019re also lining up those gluten strands into an orderly structure that\u2019s strong and tight. Well-kneaded swirl buns will have a smooth surface and tight crumb, while no-knead focaccia is bumpy, with a wildly irregular cross section.Okay, so how do I do it?Kneading dough is as simple as pushing the dough away from you with the heel of your palm, folding it over itself with your fingers, and pulling it back. This repeated push-pull cross-knits the protein strands, developing a strong gluten net.Some recipes may tell you to knead on a lightly floured surface, while others specify a surface with no flour at all. It\u2019s important to read the directions carefully because recipes are specifically formulated for a certain method. The wet, sticky dough in the Cinnamon-Date Sticky Buns, for example, is kneaded on an un-floured surface for a light and fluffy bread with a tender and open crumb.And how do I know when I\u2019m done?A dough might start out lumpy and wet, but as you knead, it will grow smooth, supple, and springy\u2014that\u2019s how you know you\u2019ve fully developed your gluten network and can stop kneading. Under-kneaded dough won\u2019t rise properly because it doesn\u2019t have the strength and elasticity to capture the gases produced by yeast\u2014it'll bake up dry, crumbly, and dense.Always follow the visual cues in each specific recipe: If the recipe asks you to knead your dough until it passes the windowpane test (you can stretch the dough to be so thin, without tearing, that you can see light through it), then take it that far. But if your recipe instructs you to knead just until smooth, you won\u2019t make a better bread through continued kneading. For most recipes, it\u2019s hard to over-knead your dough by hand, but you do risk overheating it, and that could prematurely kickstart proofing.Follow the recipe and don\u2019t be afraid to push your dough around a bit\u2014you\u2019ve gotta get that gluten in line.Ready for some practice?Cinnamon-Date Sticky BunsThese fluffy buttermilk-laced buns are filled with a cinnamon-scented date pur\u00e9e to capture all that gooey sticky bun glory without being overly sweet.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasically BakingDoughRecipes you want to make.
