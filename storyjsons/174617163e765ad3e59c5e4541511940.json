I'm going to try it. \nAre there any cloves in this recipe.  They are mentioned a few times in thee recipe but you seem to be talking about the garlic at the time.  FYI.\nSharon Frost\nOntario, CanadaShari FrostOntario, Canada3/1/2021\"...botulinum is an anaerobic bacterium, meaning it can only grow in the absence of oxygen...\" W.H.O.   M. TynerNYC1/13/2021Just a quick note! The recipe does include instructions to refrigerate after baking and for those who have botulism concerns, heating foods above 248 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 5 minutes will kill any botulism spores. After 2 weeks of storage in the fridge, there\u2019s the possibility that the garlic will start to lose its texture and may start developing rancid flavors. Treat the 2 weeks as a \u201cbest by\u201d date rather than a hard expiration date. I hope this helps clear up any confusion. AnonymousRangeley, Maine11/26/2019When it is stored improperly in oil (without oxygen) and in warm temperatures (at room temperature), it can produce a very serious toxin that causes the illness botulism. Botulism can be fatal if not treated immediately. It is very important to refrigerate garlic confit, as per the Center for Disease Control.AnonymousKansas City11/9/2019I just prepared this and there isn't enough oil to submerge all cloves in the jar. Should I just add plain EV olive oil to cover? Do I understand that it won't keep beyond two weeks?\nwagner_eRochester NY10/12/2019DJHOUTS from Fresno, I agree that the wording is confusing.  But in the original article about the recipe (but not with the recipe) they say that it will keep for two weeks.  That seems short too me since the \"confit'ing\" of things are not just about cooking but also preserving, but I'm not the expert on this so I'll stick with their guidance.  My plan is to cut the recipe in half, write the date on a piece of tape on the jar as a reminder of the \"expiration\" and as a reminder to make another batch. bryon1New York, New York10/15/2018Not a review but a question. You always say in your recipes, \"Can be so many days ahead\". Like this one, two weeks ahead. Does that mean that you can serve it in two weeks and then throw it out? How long does it last in the fridge? I make some of your sauce recipes and have the same problem. How long does things last in the fridge.djhoutsFresno, CA10/9/2018Not a review but a question.
