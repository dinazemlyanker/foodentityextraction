It\u2019s a right of passage, a responsibility earned with seniority. This year, Andy Baraghani got the call. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor,\u201d Andy told me, \u201clike I\u2019m nominated for an Oscar. It\u2019s just an honor to be nominated. Well, in this case, I won the Oscar.\u201d He started waving away tears (Andy watches a lot of Oscar speeches late at night.)The Thanksgiving menu for 2018 focused on finding the best possible versions of classics; this wasn\u2019t a moment to get kooky, but to get technical. And the bird was no exception. The assignment: Develop a foolproof, always-turns-out-right turkey recipe. Every element was considered to the nth degree. Golden, crackly skin. Juicy interior. Actual turkey flavor. In the end, we got this recipe from Andy, which I\u2019ll break down one crucial point at a time. It\u2019ll be fun, though\u2014a real turkey ride on the way to optimal turkeytown. This is how you get there.First, we dry brineAndy\u2019s recipe calls for a salt and sugar dry rub, massaged all over the bird 12 hours (or up to two days) before the big day. This is the key to a juicy, actually delicious turkey (and chicken too!). That\u2019s because the salt pulls out the water from inside the turkey, creating some salty turkey juices (SORRY there\u2019s no other way to say it) that, after some time hanging out in the fridge, soak back into the bird like the giant meat sponge that it is. The turkey loses a lot of water when it cooks in the oven, but the salt helps the muscles retain more moisture, meaning the turkey will stay moist-er by eating time. The salt also helps loosen up the stringy turkey muscles, making it possible for us to enjoy this thing. Beyond that, and if you like to throw around words like \u201cosmosis,\u201d I highly recommend reading the entirety of J. Kenji Lopez-Alt\u2019s The Food Lab, or just this article on brining. Regardless of what is going on beneath the surface of the flesh, the salt and sugar are amplifying flavor, and the sugar helps with that Norman Rockwell golden amber color once it caramelizes in the oven.Juicy turkey is possible, people. Let\u2018s make dreams happen.\nPhoto by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiWhy dry is better than wet brineOr maybe you enjoy filling a huge cooler or tub, Splash mermaid-bath-style, with salt water? It\u2019s a pain, it\u2019s a mess, and that bucket of brine takes up way too much real estate in the refrigerator. Plus, it ends up waterlogging the turkey and diluting the flavor.Then we glazeThing we all want: a turkey with a cover-worthy sheen and golden color. Get it with Andy\u2019s simple sweet-punchy-herby glaze made of vinegar, honey, Worcestershire sauce, rosemary, garlic, orange zest, and butter. (Can also be accomplished by covering it with butter and leaving it on your roof, Kramer-style??). You paint the glaze on every 30 minutes, which might only be two or three times because...What you need to know about timingThe recipe is timed so that you go hard at the beginning, 450\u00b0 for 30 minutes, to get some color on the skin, and then go down to 300\u00b0 for 65-85 minutes (this is for a 12\u201314-lb turkey). This isn\u2019t your wake-up-at-the-crack-of-dawn all-day turkey marathon recipe.What you need to know about pansRing a bell or something! I have an announcement. This recipe calls for a rimmed baking sheet with a wire rack. Like this one. Without the high walls of a roasting pan, the turkey is able to get color ALL OVER, which we skin-stealers like. But yes, you can still totally do this in a regular roasting pan. (Especially if you\u2019re the clumsy type\u2014it\u2019s a big, heavy turkey on a wire rack.)So yeah, we used a roasting pan in this photo shoot.\nPhoto by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiPro tip: Add a cup of water in the bottom of the baking sheet to mix with the turkey juices (AGAIN, MY APOLOGIES). The water keeps the juices from burning and making the turkey taste burnt, even if it technically isn\u2019t. Too much water will steam your turkey though, and while a turkey sauna sounds like some kind of Black Friday wellness deal, we DON\u2019T WANT IT. Steam = soggy skin.What you need to know about the turkey\u2019s internal temperatureStab the turkey with your trusty Thermapen in the thickest part of breast near the neck, and when it registers 150\u00b0, you\u2019re done. If that sounds low, don\u2019t be alarmed, it\u2019s going to keep cooking outside of the oven. It\u2019s so big, it\u2019s become a turkey oven itself.Rest that turkey!!!This might be a duh for SOME of you but we gotta repeat: Let the finished bird lie there. On the cutting board, away from prying uncles and sniffy dogs. For at least 30 minutes, to an hour. This thing is an animal. The muscles tighten while cooking, and we want to be able to slice it and shove it into our faces, as animals ourselves. Let it rest to let those muscles relax, to let the inner juices (SORRY x3) redistribute. Will it cool down in that time? NO. It retains heat like an industrial sleeping bag.Any further questions?
