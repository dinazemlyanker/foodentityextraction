But what\u2019s that in the pantry, hiding behind the baking soda and the anchovies? It\u2019s onion powder! A perfectly good substitute, you might think.After all, onion powder is just dried and pulverized onions\u2014the essence of onion, if you will. But just because the two have a very close relationship doesn\u2019t mean they can be used interchangeably. Each is unique, and before you go swapping one for the other, you should consider what each brings to the table.Fresh onions are more than their taste. They have texture\u2014a real crunch when raw, a buttery softness when caramelized. They\u2019re also approximately 89% water, which means that when you cook with them, you\u2019re introducing moisture into your dish.Onion powder, on the other hand, comes from onions that have been dried (either air-dried, dehydrated, or freeze-dried) and then crushed to varying degrees, from flakes to powder. No texture, no water, and a more concentrated oniony punch. And just like with fresh onions, the flavor of onion powder varies, too. It can be made from any kind of onion, be it biting white, milder red, or sweeter yellow. It can be made solely of the bulb\u2014the onioniest part of the onion\u2014or it can include the root, stem, or skin. The onions can be dry-roasted before they\u2019re pulverized, resulting in a golden-brown, mellow-but-toasty powder\u2014or not! Regardless, what you\u2019re getting is undeniably distinct from a whole onion.Onion powder offers provides that umami-forward, almost nostalgic-tasting something-something that keeps you coming back bite after bite. Use it where you would garlic powder\u2014when you want to introduce big flavor without additional wetness or texture: Think dry rubs, popcorn seasoning, potato chips, mixed nuts, hamburgers, or the dredging for chicken cutlets.Adding raw onion to potato chips would be... not good. These get their irresistible flavor from onion powder, instead.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Sue Li, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiAnd sometimes, fresh onions and onion powder can actually enhance each other. Want to throw a pinch into this onion dip? Go right ahead. Want to add some to a frittata or scramble? Fine! This potato salad was actually developed with the idea that each has something to give. Which is all to say: There\u2019s no reason that you can\u2019t add onion powder to a dish that already calls for onions, but don\u2019t use it as a 1:1 stand-in.Both onions and onion powder are delicious in their own right, and they can be even better together. It\u2019s enough to bring tears to your eyes. (Well, at least sometimes.)The more you know, the better your potato salad will be:Sour Cream and Onion Potato SaladThis recipe was an excuse to combine our favorite potato chip flavor with the creamy, salty \"salad\" of our dreams. To hammer that home, the whole dish is topped with crumbled sour cream and onion potato chips.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titOnionOnion PowderRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
