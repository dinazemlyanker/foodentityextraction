It\u2019s been less than a week since the clocks rolled back, and the liquids are already flowing. Simple ribollita? Finished the batch on Wednesday for lunch. Chicken and rice soup? Last night\u2019s dinner. And I\u2019m already planning for what\u2019s coming next: kale minestrone with pistou.Packed with vegetables (leeks, onions, carrots, celery), greens (kale), beans (cannellini), tomatoes (canned, duh), pancetta (just a bit for flavor), and potatoes (waxy Yukons take the place of pasta), it\u2019s a hearty, satisfying pot of chunky deliciousness\u2014the whole food pyramid in a single pot. (If you want to go completely vegetarian, the pig is optional; you won\u2019t even miss it.)Yes the ingredients are many\u2014the recipe also includes the makings of a \u201cpistou,\u201d which is French for \u201cpesto,\u201d and an \u201cherb sachet\u201d a.k.a. \u201cbouquet garni\u201d (fancy speak for \u201csome herbs tied up with string\u201d)\u2014but really, it\u2019s just chopping. And you definitely don\u2019t need to get precious with that: The beauty of minestrone is that it\u2019s rustic and unfussy; the more imperfect it seems, the better and more appetizing it looks. It helps, too, that there\u2019s a fresh herby drizzle to go on top, adding a bright shock of basil, garlic, parm, and lemon zest to the soup\u2019s deep, developed flavors.Best yet, this soup makes eight servings, which means if you\u2019re not interested in sharing, that\u2019s a whole week of really good soup right there. Because you know what else the onset of winter indicates? That it\u2019s the time of year to get a little bit lazy (uh, I mean \"cozy\"), too.Get the recipe:Kale Minestrone With PistouThis rave-worthy soup is all about layering powerful flavor-enhancers that you probably already have on hand\u2014tomato paste, herbs, Parm, and, of course, kosher salt.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titNever FailSoupRecipes you want to make.
