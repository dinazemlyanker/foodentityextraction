No. It is the perfect cookie,\u201d she replied in a 17-page brief that points to several cases of \u201ccookie precedence.\u201dOkay. But if you could wrap your head around the POSSIBILITY that there is a better cookie out there, I\u2019d point to the Oat and Pecan Brittle Cookies in Claire Saffitz\u2019s cookbook, Dessert Person. (Full disclosure: I am Claire\u2019s former coworker and I adore her. But I\u2019ve made a lot of cookies in my day\u2014including three others from her book\u2014but none that blew my boots off quite like these.)The name doesn\u2019t quite do it justice. You have a cookie the size of a toddler\u2019s face. It\u2019s gorgeously textured from undulating waves of butter that spread in the heat of the oven. That would be brown butter, by the way, which makes it taste caramelized and fancy bakery expensive. But what brought me to my knees is the fact that you make pecan brittle, then blitz up SOME of it with the cookie dough\u2019s dry ingredients while leaving SOME in small broken chunks for the final dough mixture. The final cookie is crispy-edged, thin, and chewy-centered from the oatmeal, with tiny crispy pecan brittle bits throughout.I prefer it to all other cookies. It\u2019s the best cookie I\u2019ve ever made. I feel as confident with this hyperbolic declaration as any I\u2019ve ever made. I feel it strongly! And urgently! You need to make this cookie!To confirm that it\u2019s the best cookie, I shared my cookies, which wasn\u2019t easy, with family and neighbors. \u201cThis is an amazing cookie,\u201d they all (basically) said. I\u2019m rounding that up to \u201cbest.\u201dI even asked the creator herself. \u201cIt\u2019s not just you!\u201d said Claire, who has some of the cookie dough in her freezer right now. \u201cWhen I was developing this cookie, I wondered exactly the same thing myself, It really IS the best, right?\u201d Her theory: \u201cI think it\u2019s that combination of a chewy center and lacy edge, plus the mix of butterscotchy-ness plus oaty-ness plus toasty pecans. Plus, it\u2019s SALTY. It\u2019s just the total cookie package.\u201d I love Claire\u2019s confidence in her own cookies.Why are the cookies so HUGE? I asked. \u201cI tend to make scooped cookies like this large because it affords the cookies the ability to achieve every texture possible, from a crisp, deeply caramelized edge to a soft, barely set center and everything in between. The larger the cookie, the more variation between the edge and the center and the more delicious it is to eat.\u201dDon\u2019t sleep on this one\u2026\nIn Dessert Person, Claire writes you can substitute in Heath toffee bits. Do NOT listen to her. Heath bits are great, but making pecan brittle \u201cwill definitely contribute to a superior outcome,\u201d Claire says. You cannot top the flavor and the shard-awesome texture of homemade brittle. Go to the trouble\u2014which isn\u2019t too much trouble, I swear\u2014of making the pecan brittle. I thought I had messed up mine, made the brittle too thick, but it turned out perfect in the end because you chop it up anyway.Then the cookie dough MUST rest overnight. It\u2019s cruel! After all the work you put in so far! But let the cookies be complicated. They make you wait, and they taste that much better for it. By chilling the dough in the fridge, Claire says \u201cthe dough \u2018cures,\u2019 during which the sugar further dissolves, contributing to a chewier texture. The rest also allows the flour to fully hydrate and the fat to solidify, so you get the most pleasing spread and wrinkly surface during baking. It\u2019s science-y, and I wish I could speak of it on a more technical level, but I know empirically that it improves basically every kind of cookie.\u201dShe put a lot of thought into cookies. That\u2019s why Claire is Claire. And also why you need to make these as instructed in the recipe. Spend a ton of time making these. Share them with your friends and neighbors and mail carriers. Yes, 2020 is the WORST. Let these cookies be the best.Get the recipe:Oat and Pecan Brittle CookiesA gorgeously textured cookie with crispy-edges, a chewy center, toasty pecans, and tiny crispy pecan brittle bits throughout.View RecipeDessert Person$16 at Amazon$32 at BookshopExplore Bon App\u00e9titHoliday CookiesCookbooksRecipes you want to make.
