Well, \u201cPatricia glued it back on,\u201d Angie Mar told me. That would be the New York chef\u2019s assistant, Patricia Howard, who sourced a menagerie of previously living props for Mar\u2019s new not-exactly-a-cookbook, Butcher and Beast. On page 117 Mar descends the steps of her subterranean West Village restaurant, the Beatrice Inn, wearing a fur coat and Louboutins, bottle of Champagne in one hand, beady-eyed skunk on a leash in the other. The message is: None of us is going to make it out of here alive, pour the Champagne.Skunk alert.\u00a0\nPhoto by Johnny MillerButcher and Beast feels more like an art-photo-fashion kind of book than one to actually cook from. The recipes seem to sigh on the page, You really gonna make that? Bone marrow cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, really? There\u2019s cleavage galore, dangling cigarettes, and a lotta leg. The photos are nocturnal Polaroids by the photographer Johnny Miller; every shot seems snapped from a blowout New Year\u2019s bash. Taxidermy drops in among the freshly shot deer and tied-up squabs headed to the oven.\u201cAm I wrong,\u201d I asked Mar, \u201cor is this book a giant \u2018fuck you\u2019 to every other cookbook?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely not wrong.\u201d\u201cIs it sexist of me to say something about the cleavage?\u201d\u201cNo! Food should be sexy. Food is sensual. It\u2019s not about just what we taste. What does it look like when it comes out, who are the people eating it, sitting around the dinner table, the lighting, music, smells in the air.\u201dTo illustrate the recipe for wild boar tagliatelle, Mar borrowed a boar\u2019s head from Pat LaFrieda, where it lives on the wall in his office.\nPhoto by Johnny MillerMar was supposed to write a cookbook on Sunday entertaining, big roasts and all that, and then six years went by. Wholesome Sunday dinner wasn\u2019t reflective of her real life, which was spent in the restaurant late into the night, and also included cigarettes, champagne, and stilettos.\u201cOur book will not look like every other book,\u201d she remembers thinking. \u201cIt won\u2019t be this sugar-coated version of how things are. This restaurant isn\u2019t sugar-coated. It\u2019s not for the faint of heart. It\u2019s wild, it\u2019s New York, it\u2019s old New York\u2014the New York that\u2019s dying right now,\u201d she said. It would be provocative and unapologetic. You can imagine how that went over with the book\u2019s editor. \u201cWe fought a lot of battles to get it published,\u201d Mar said. She was willing to give back her advance and take the book elsewhere, but she in the end, didn\u2019t have to.There was a food stylist (norm for a cookbook) and a clothes stylist (not the norm). Annebet Duvall pulled Chanel, Zimmerman, and wham-bam jewelry that came with a security guard who watched over days of photo shoots. Without the designer dress-up, \u201cit wouldn\u2019t have been such a true representation of how we live here, what dinner is like around our tables,\u201d Mar said. In one shot in a walk-in fridge with a tuxedoed Pat LaFrieda (famed New York butcher and Mar\u2019s meat mentor), she wears a \u201cvery Jessica Rabbit\u201d black, slinky Alexandre Vauthier evening gown (pictured below). On the cover she\u2019s posed in the Bea\u2019s kitchen in a fluffy ostrich feather Oscar de la Renta bustier with silk pants. The most memorable look, second to skunk, is a poofy hot pink vintage Stella McCartney dress she wears in front of a platter of oxtail and escargot bourguignon (see it up top). \u201cThere\u2019s escargot,\u201d said Mar, \u201cso we needed to channel Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman.\u201d Obviously!Milk-braised pork shoulder from Butcher and Beast.\nPhoto by Johnny MillerThe recipes\u2014extravagant, meaty dishes from the restaurant\u2014are introduced with historical and personal backstories. Marie Callender\u2019s pot pies get a shout-out. King Louis XIV shows up. She lets the opulent food luxuriate in its truth: \u201cThis dish is a baller move\u201d (the marrow cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e). \u201cI like to serve it claw-on for maximum visual shock\u201d (poulet petite fille). The food is shot haphazard, demolished, mid-mouth. Each recipe sets a scene and you\u2019re an extra in the background, peering in. I\u2019m not sure the point is to even try to recreate this at home.At some point I asked her about...veganism. She recently told The Cut that she doesn\u2019t understand it. \u201cMy attitude is polarizing, I\u2019ve never shied away from it,\u201d she said. \u201cSomebody once told me if everybody loved me I\u2019d be mediocre. If 50 percent of people love you, 50 percent hate you, you know you\u2019re doing something right.\u201dMaybe I got too hung up on the overall sexiness. It\u2019s just such a relief, really. I\u2019m writing this in elastic-waist pants and clunky clogs. I\u2019ve eased myself into a world where food is casual and comfortable and I\u2019ve lost my sight of the sequins and glamour, and staying up past 11 p.m. Flipping through Butcher and Beast is a voyeuristic peek into that concurrent universe. Everyone is so cool and diamond-drenched and collagen-glowy. It makes me want to drink more madeira. Spend more time in the dark.\u201cLook. I was never going to do light, bright photography in that southern Cali style,\u201d Mar told me. \u201cI\u2019m New York to the core.\u201dCover photo by Johnny MillerBuy it: Butcher and Beast by Angie Mar with Jamie Feldmar, $36 on AmazonGet the Recipe for Mar\u2019s Prime Rib Roast:Rosemary-Crusted Prime Rib RoastThe trick to a roast a crisp crust?
