Sliced thick or thin, this mild-spicy sausage brings a ton of savory goodness to any pizza party.\u00a0But pepperoni doesn\u2019t have to be kept in a box (even if it\u2019s a box with a little plastic table in the middle to stop the cheese from getting stuck to the top). Think beyond pizza! This versatile ingredient presents a whole world of possibilities just waiting to be discovered.So what is pepperoni?Before it ends up at your slice shop, most pepperoni starts out as ground pork, beef, or a mixture of the two. Producers then add paprika, which helps give the sausage its characteristic deep red hue, as well as garlic and other aromatics like fennel seeds to up the flavor factor. Once it\u2019s packaged into sausages, the mixture is aged for several days before being smoked and dried. Throughout this process the sausages undergo mild fermentation, during which lactic acid builds up, contributing to the deep tangy flavor, and water is lost, creating the dense, chewy texture we love.Pepperoni may sound 100% Italian, but it is an American invention. According to Angie Rito and Scott Tacinelli, writers of the cookbook Italian American and chef-owners behind New York\u2019s Don Angie restaurant, there\u2019s some mystery about where and when the sausage was first made, but it appeared sometime in the early 1900s in butcher shops and pizzerias in the US.Italian American: Red Sauce Classics and New Essentials$35 $30 at Amazon$35 $32 at Bookshop\u201cIt seems to be most closely related to a Neapolitan- or Calabrese-style dried salami that would have a lot of dried chiles in it,\u201d Rito explains, noting that early waves of Italian migration predominantly came from the region\u2019s southern territories. Without access to the same ingredients, early Italian American butchers had to adapt salami recipes based on what was on hand. \u201cPaprika would have been more readily available and cheaper [in the United States],\u201d says Rito, \u201cand then people realized it was just delicious.\u201dEnough about pizza! But also, would you look at that pizza?!\nPhoto by Emma Fishman, Food Styling by D'mytrek BrownHow can you cook with pepperoni?Even though pepperoni is nearly synonymous with pizza, you should keep an open mind about this bright red sausage\u2019s potential. In Rito and Tacinelli\u2019s recipe for Stuffed Mussels With Pepperoni Rice, fat is rendered out of finely chopped pepperoni and used to add a pop of color and flavor to arborio rice. \u201cThere\u2019s something about the color that we like,\u201d Tacinelli says. \u201cWe use it in rag\u00f9s and other sauces, rendering out that vibrant oil.\u201d In their cookbook, Rito and Tacinelli use that same oil to create deeply crimson breadcrumbs, which they pour over salads to add a salty, spicy crunch.To eke out as much of that sweet, sweet grease as possible, you must first break down the sausage into smaller pieces. You can do this with a knife, but to get even more flavor from their pepperoni, Rito and Tacinelli use a meat grinder to return the sausage to a fine crumble. If you don\u2019t have one at home, Tacinelli says a food processor works just as well.Of course, pepperoni is just as good if you don\u2019t cook it before eating. Because dangerous microbes are killed during the curing process, it\u2019s safe to eat the sausage raw (Tacinelli keeps a stick in the fridge for this exact reason). Put some out on your next charcuterie board or sub it in for salami to spice up hoagies and grinders.Where do I get the best pepperoni?For the real primo stuff, talk to the butcher at your local Italian grocer or deli about house-made sausages. But if you can\u2019t find anything nearby, artisanal brands like Vermont Smoke & Cure and Citterio make great offerings available nationwide or for mail order.For most applications, however, Rito likes to keep it simple. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very nostalgic ingredient,\u201d she says, \u201cso I like to go for the most classic flavor possible.\u201d That means reaching for grocery store and deli counter brands like Boar\u2019s Head and Hormel, which are readily available nationwide and likely taste closest to the pepperoni of your childhood memories because they are the pepperoni of your childhood memories.The one caveat is that you should try to buy pepperoni in one piece, as a \u201cstick\u201d rather than in a bag. \u201cWhen you get the presliced stuff, it\u2019s already starting to oxidize,\u201d says Rito, who prefers to buy the sausage with the casing intact. \u201cThat's how you're going to get the freshest flavor from the salami.\u201d If you can\u2019t find whole sticks of pepperoni in your grocery store\u2019s fridges, Tacinelli suggests checking the deli counter, where you should be able to ask for a whole, half, or quarter stick.How can you make pepperoni cups?While wide and thin rounds of pepperoni will cover more surface area and give you a bit of pepperoni flavor in every bite, to generate pepperoni cups\u2014the chewy, greasy bowls that are all the rage at spots like NYC\u2019s Prince Street Pizza\u2014you need smaller, fatter rounds.Getting the thickness right relies on a Goldilocks rule: Cut them too thin and the meat will stick to the cheese, but too thick and the edges will be too heavy to curl. According to J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt, you\u2019ll want to use sausage with a natural or collagen casing that\u2019s cut medium-thick\u2014think 2\u20133 millimeters. It can take some practice though, so be ready to eat a lot of pepperoni while you learn. I know, poor you.Now about those mussels\u2026Stuffed Mussels With Pepperoni RiceEven though we could devour every last one of these hearty stuffed mussels on our own, we recommend making this feast a group activity.\u00a0View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
