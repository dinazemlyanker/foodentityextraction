Don\u2019t you all have these? Well, you should. The K\u00fcchenprofi tweezer tongs easily make my top five of desert island kitchen tools\u2014hell, they might even be in the number two spot right behind my chef\u2019s knife! That\u2019s because they can do anything tongs can do\u2014grip, grab, and flip heavy roasts and steaks with ease\u2014but with the precision and delicate touch of tweezers.Now let me be clear: I\u2019m not talking about the fine-tipped little guys that fancy-dude chefs use to plate one micro herb at a time. (But yes, I do also own those and they\u2019re great for getting one caper out of a jar!) I\u2019m referring to these foot-long, heavy-bodied long boys that are a lot like metal cooking chopsticks that have been welded together, so they require no skill or practice to operate.Unlike tongs, these tweezer tongs are slim and compact, fitting into any tool crock, drawer, or even apron pocket if you\u2019re all about that quick draw. There\u2019s no fussy locking mechanism to slow you down while cooking, no weird nooks or pockets for food or hot water to get caught in. And without the sharp scalloped edge of a tong, there\u2019s less risk of tearing up your food as you\u2019re cooking it.Instead, these tweezer tongs have grooves on the inside of their rounded ends, which help you grab even the most slippery noodle from a boiling pot to taste. They have just the right amount of resistance so you can turn a slim piece of asparagus on the grill as easily as a hefty chicken thigh.Now you get why tweezer tongs are the superior tongs!
