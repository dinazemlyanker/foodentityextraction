I hoard gas station Twix. In my small town grocery store, blocks of a large square 58% cocoa number that costs eight literal dollars follow me home in droves. Foreign airports are my favorite; the blind roulette of surprise waits behind shiny wrappers. What is it? A brown brick of delight, that\u2019s what. There is only one thing that deters me: cold straight-from-the-fridge chocolate. It\u2019s chalky, firm, and uninviting. One clench of the molars and the whole thing breaks apart like a hunk of dense clay. The best chocolate is fudge-like, so soft it almost melts on the tongue. For that kind of pliability, you either need to leave your squares on the coffee table through a full episode of Euphoria, or you can buy a variety pack of Honey Mama\u2019s Cocoa Truffle Bars.Photograph by Isa Zapata. \u00a0Food Styling by Thu BuserChocolate Truffle Bars$30 at Honey Mama's (Small Bar Variety Pack)$54 at Honey Mama's (Large Bar Variety Pack)Made from a core triumvirate of tasty ingredients\u2014cocoa, raw honey, and unrefined coconut oil\u2014they\u2019re a textural masterpiece. These truffle bars are rich and buttery; every bite is like the middle piece of a brownie batch. They\u2019re also a little chewy, which I expect we can thank drippy-drizzly honey for. Straight from the fridge (which is where you should keep them, lest they actually do melt), a fingernail can be driven into them with barely a shred of resistance. Honey Mama\u2019s are always ready to be eaten, and I love them for this.The flavors are dynamic, which is why you need the variety pack. Some are laced with desiccated coconut, sprouted almonds, or coffee grounds; others are smooth like ganache. Tahini Tangerine\u2014both earthy and bright with citrus\u2014whisks me away to somewhere warm, with palm fronds. The Ginger Cardamom is peppy and bracing, a little bit like masala chai in chocolate truffle form. I like to cut the roasty Coffee & Nibs flavor into little squares when I\u2019m on deadline and pop one as a reward every time I finish a paragraph. (Almost there!) And while the namesake honey in each bar delivers my ideal texture, it\u2019s also more floral and caramelly than plain old sugar.As you can probably discern from the ingredients mentioned thus far, these truffle bars are virtually health foods. (Honey Mama\u2019s was born in Oregon.) They contain no refined sugar, are made in a gluten-free kitchen, and are technically raw. This is not why they\u2019re worth buying, though it certainly feels like a boon to be eating something that tastes like buttercream frosting but, nutritionally speaking, is more like trail mix.By the final bite Honey Mama\u2019s Truffle Bars are almost mousse-like and leave a pleasant residue of coconutty oil on my fingertips. It\u2019s a hard world out there, but fudgy chocolate is a reminder that from squish we came and to squish we will go. My Twix are quivering in their foil.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
