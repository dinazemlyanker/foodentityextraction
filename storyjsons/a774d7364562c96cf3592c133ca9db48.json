Like cleaning out the closet but not dealing with the piles. Or the Reading/Writing section of the SATs but not the Math. Or making a side dish but not the whole meal. So when my better half (haha, get it?) is making chicken thighs for dinner, or pork chops, or penne alla vodka, I\u2019m in charge of the sides. And all that\u2019s a convoluted way of saying that these white beans with lemon and broccoli rabe are that side.We\u2019ve been really pushing the bean agenda at Bon App\u00e9tit lately and that\u2019s for a reason, or three: cheap, healthy, delicious. In this recipe, we\u2019re using two cans of cannellinis. Also called white kidney beans, they\u2019re another list of three: creamy, buttery, possibly already in the back of your pantry. The other major players of this dish are broccoli rabe a.k.a. rapini (it's NOT broccoli, gah) and an entire thinly sliced lemon that caramelizes a little and counters the bitter broc.The minor, but not to be ignored, players are anchovies, garlic, red pepper flakes, and parmesan. Umami city. A little heat. And since those ingredients are typically already in my pasta-prolific pantry and fridge, all I need to pick up at the store to complete the recipe is the broccoli rabe. (Now picture me in line at the store with a basket full of things I definitely don\u2019t need, plus broccoli rabe.)The cooking process comes down to three throwing-stuff-in steps: First, throw in and cook the lemon, anchovies, and garlic in oil, 5 minutes-ish. Second, throw in broccoli rabe and cook, 5 minutes-ish. Third, throw in beans and water to simmer, 5 minutes-ish.When it\u2019s time to serve, hit it with cheese and red pepper flakes and fill half your plate. You did it! You\u2019re halfway there.Get the recipe:White Beans with Broccoli Rabe and LemonIf you like bold, assertive flavors\u2014like broccoli rabe and lemon\u2014this rustic white bean side dish is the recipe for you.
