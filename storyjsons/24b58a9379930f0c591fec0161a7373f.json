It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Cooking lamb is never a baaad idea.The name of this article has temporarily been changed to \u201cshameless self promotion,\u201d and I am using my bully pulpit to preach about my own recipe for a cut of meat you\u2019ve been giving side-eye to for far too long.Yes, that\u2019s right, I\u2019m talking about lamb\u2014marinated, grilled, shoulder of lamb. Even though this dish is an imperfect replication of the grilled leg of lamb that my mom makes for Easter every year, I am prepared to take full credit for the recipe, and I\u2019m going to eat it any time of year that I damn well please. I am especially excited about the idea of having it in the summer because lamb goes so well with all the Mediterranean flavors I love: olive oil, fresh herbs, garlic, tangy yogurt, lemon, vinegar, fat summer tomatoes.But first, I have to dispatch the objectors: \u201cLamb!\u201d I hear those silly skeptics scream. \u201cLamb is so gamy. It\u2019s so grassy. It\u2019s so expensive!\u201dFacts: Lamb graze on grass. They\u2019re ruminants; they forage, and if you have had lamb that tasted grassy, the source of the trouble goes back to their diet. To American palates\u2014us carnivores raised on lavishly marbled, corn-fed beef\u2014the flavor of a naturally grass-fed animal can raise eyebrows. You might say it\u2019s gamy. A native Australian would describe it simply as lamby. Cuts of meat from smaller (er, younger) lamb are more mild, and it\u2019s common these days to find lamb that are partially raised on corn, which makes them even sweeter.Want this letter before it hits the website?

If it makes you feel better\u2014and I am all about making you feel better\u2014the vinegar-forward marinade with pur\u00e9ed onions and tons of rosemary helps tenderize the lamb, infuses it with bright flavor, and makes it deliciously crunchy when the lamb hits the grill.The expensive part is true\u2014that is, if the only price tag you\u2019re looking at is for a rack of rib chops. That cut can easily set you back upwards of $20 a pound, and if you were to accidentally overcook one of those itty-bitty ribs, you\u2019d be very upset.That\u2019s why I chose a shoulder roast for this recipe. It\u2019s not only affordable, it\u2019s a cut that begs to be grilled slowly over a medium fire. Cooking over moderate heat affords you plenty of runway, so you can take your time to develop a deep, flavorful crust without worrying for a minute about the possibility of overcooking. Picture it: There you are, standing by your grill in the great backyard-outdoors, with a pair of tongs in your hands and smoky meat vapors flowing through your hair, confidently grilling your lamb until it hits 140\u00b0, the secret temperature for a just-pink interior.Lamb, like any good meat, needs to rest before slicing. I thought it was a good idea to do this atop a bed of sliced tomatoes and fresh rosemary sprigs. As the lamb cools, it releases juices onto the tomatoes, which warm up, absorb these drippings, and create some of their own. By the time the lamb is ready to slice, the tomatoes will be sitting in a meat-fat marinade, and you should definitely tilt the platter and spoon some of these juices onto each serving. Then serve with a side of lemon-garlic yogurt and prove everyone wrong about this whole lamb thing.Get the recipe:Grilled Rosemary Lamb with Juicy TomatoesLamb shoulder: Not just for braising!
