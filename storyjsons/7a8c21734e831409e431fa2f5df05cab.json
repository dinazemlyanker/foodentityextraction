For a lot of things, but most pressingly for someone to write some strict, straightforward guidelines that outline the acceptable places to consume egg salad. It seems as though a lot of people haven\u2019t quite figured that out yet. Don't get me wrong: I love the stuff. But its aroma can be a little...much for public spaces. Since no such literature exists, I\u2019ve taken it upon myself to come up with some starting points. They are as follows:1. You should not eat egg salad in a closed vehicle (especially trains and planes). Open air conveyances like boats and convertibles are acceptable, so long as they are safe. 2. You should not eat egg salad at your desk in an office. 3. Well...that's really as far as I\u2019ve gotten. Just don't eat egg salad in an enclosed, public space. It\u2019s a bad look. No, it\u2019s the worst look. But you know where you can\u2014and should\u2014enjoy egg salad? At home. During Rent Week.Let\u2019s do that. You thought I was just going to bring up egg salad and then tell you how to make French onion soup? No. I\u2019m not here to deceive you. Smash the play button on this 1960 Something playlist (filled with tunes from the 60\u2019s, an era that always makes me think of egg salad, and free of charge), and get those eggs out of the fridge.Well, actually, put the eggs down. My bad. We\u2019re going to start by making some quick pickles. Pour about \u00bd cup of white vinegar in a small bowl, and whisk in 1\u00bd Tbsp. of salt and 1 Tbsp. of sugar. Peel and thinly slice 2 shallots and throw them into the vinegar mixture. (You could use onion, too, if you don't have shallots lying around.) These will just sit in the bowl until we serve our egg salad. Don\u2019t bother them. They\u2019ll be fine.Photo by Chelsie CraigYou need to make eggs to make egg salad. That\u2019s an inescapable truth. But this is not going to be your standard finely-chopped, spackling-esque mixture of (very) hard-boiled eggs and mayo. And no, there's not going to be celery in this egg salad. (Celery in egg salad is atrocious, IMHO.) We're making jammy egg salad, and to make jammy egg salad, we need jammy eggs.Wait. What\u2019s a jammy egg? Is it some kind of retro, fruit-filled dessert old folks eat in England? Well, that definitely sounds possible, but not what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m talking about a boiled egg with the most beautiful yolk consistency possible\u2014right in between hard-boiled and soft-boiled, with a partially-set, almost-runny center. That\u2019s prime real estate, and it takes about 7\u00bd minutes to get there. Boil a pot of water, and carefully lower 8 eggs into the jacuzzi. Start a timer set for 7\u00bd minutes.Once your kitchen timer goes off, your phone alarm rings, or you count to 450 aloud, transfer the eggs to a bowl filled with ice and water. We\u2019ll call this an ice bath. Putting your eggs in the ice bath for a few minutes makes them a hell of a lot easier to peel. Plus, it\u2019s just cool to drop the term \u201cice bath\u201d in casual conversation. It makes your kitchen seem a lot more well-equipped than it is. You don\u2019t have to tell anyone that an \u201cice bath\u201d is just \u201ca bowl of ice water.\u201dPhoto by Chelsie CraigWhile the eggs are chilling, make some dressing. The dressing for this egg salad is extremely simple, essentially a cheater\u2019s version of a mustard vinaigrette. I don\u2019t always look down on cheaters. Sometimes, a cheater is just a misunderstood innovator. This dressing uses three ingredients that you should have available at just about any time: lemon juice, Hellmann\u2019s mayo, and mustard. For the mustard, whole grain dijon is preferable, but anything besides classic ballpark yellow will work just fine. Mix \u00bc cup mayo, 3 Tbsp. whole grain mustard, a \u00bd-lemon worth of juice, and a bit of chopped fresh parsley (if you're feeling fancy) together in the bowl.Crack and peel your eggs, and cut them into quarters, lengthwise. Oh, not all of your eggs are picturesque? That\u2019s cool. I don\u2019t care. The dressing doesn\u2019t care. The eggs don\u2019t care. We\u2019re not on a photoshoot here. This is real life.Approach the mixing of the eggs and the dressing in the same way you\u2019d approach talking about your passion for writing Star Wars fan fiction on a first date\u2014with extreme caution. We want the eggs to stay intact, with just the runniest parts of the yolk mixing into the dressing. Use a spoon to move the dressing over the egg quarters, adding a sprinkle or two of kosher salt as you go.Photo by Chelsie CraigNow, let\u2019s put that egg salad on something. I like mine of some toasted Italian bread. The really basic, white stuff, crisped on the outside and fluffy on the inside.You\u2019re eating eggs tossed in mayo. Health isn\u2019t exactly the name of the game here, but if you\u2019re the Healthyish type, ditch the bread and go for a crisp piece of chilled romaine lettuce. You might be thinking, oh that\u2019s kind of a lame move. It\u2019s not. The refreshing texture of the lettuce is actually really nice with the egg salad. Some (most notably Basically editor Amiel Stanek) would call this hand salad. I would agree.Top the egg salad with a little bit of that leftover parsley, some flaky sea salt, and some of those pickled shallots. Whoa what are we looking at here? This is egg salad? It sure doesn\u2019t look like it was teleported in from some '60s-era sandwich counter. It looks...well...good. And guess what, friends. It tastes that way too.  Just, please, don't be the person that brings this on the bus.In more of a Rent Week chicken mood?
