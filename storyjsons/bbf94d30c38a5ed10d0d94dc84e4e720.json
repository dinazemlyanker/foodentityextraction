Once they\u2019re in the oven, blitz together a quick romesco sauce made from toasted almonds and roasted red peppers for dinner in half an hour. The versatile, nutty sauce adds rich flavor to other lean proteins like fish or pan-roasted chicken breasts and also makes a great dip for raw veg. (For a gluten-free dish, simply leave out the panko.)Ingredients4 servings1lb. ground turkey1large egg, beaten to blend\u2153cup panko1tsp. ground cumin1tsp. onion powder1tsp. paprika\u00bccup finely chopped parsley, plus more coarsely chopped for serving\u00betsp. kosher salt, plus more2Tbsp. plus \u00bd cup olive oil\u00bdcup toasted almonds116-oz. jar fire-roasted peppers in water, drained2small garlic cloves, crushed1Tbsp. red wine vinegar\u00bctsp. cayenne pepper\u00bdlemonPreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 425\u00b0.

What is a good substitution in this recipe or can you recommend another sauce that will work..thank youAnonymousArkansas2/2/2022I have made this several times, and everyone likes it. It\u2019s different enough to stand out and impress, but still looks familiar. When mixing the peppers and pulsed almonds, I took a little bit of both in a bowl and mixed, then added about half of the peppers so they would combine more easily - I had no problem with the texture of the almonds doing this. I also warmed the sauce in a saucepan before serving. 10/10AnonymousLondon, UK5/6/2021This has become one of my favorites. Very easy but really love the flavor. Some tweaks I've found that make it better: aim for a size that gives you 8-10 meatballs, go finer on the ground almonds, add lemon juice to sauce, and whisky in olive oil to sauce slowly until you get the consistency you want (as others have stated the called for amount is too much for me)AnonymousAtlanta, GA5/2/2021This was good at first, but even better on day 3.  I agree with one of the reviewers below that there is too much olive oil in the Romanesco sauce - would cut it to 1/4 cup next time..  Also, I didn't really care for the texture of the coarsely ground almonds and would grind them finer next time. That being said, I would make this again.AnonymousVienna, VA4/27/2021I\u2019m disappointed that after reading the reviews my husband and I both said \u201cIt\u2019s OK. Not bad but don\u2019t need to make it again.\u201d Nothing objectionable but not great. Tried to give it 3 \u2b50\ufe0f but it insists on making me game give it 5. Editorjane Atlanta4/11/2021Loved this! It's so simple that it's easy to make modifications if you want/need to, and you pretty much can't mess it up. I followed the recipe (almost) exactly, and it only took 25 minutes start to finish and the cleanup was simple. \nI added a preserved lemon to the romesco and it was *chef's kiss*. If you have them use them! izaPortland, OR3/26/2021This Romesco sauce is mighty fine.  I would have preferred it warmed over the meatballs, but my guy likes foods of differing temperatures on the same plate, so for him this room temp sauce was perfect!  Chalking it up to a cook's error, but I found the meatballs to be slightly bland.  Next time I'd add a touch more salt and seasoning.  also, the store only had extra-lean ground turkey, so next time I'd source a higher fat content, or find a way to add some fat into the grind.  \nWe served the meatballs and romseco over roasted cauliflower steaks.  Delicious!  \n\nI can see this Romesco sauce being used as a dip, watered down with some stock and turned into a soup, warmed and served over pasta, drizzled over crostini and soft cheese, added to a casserole...  Just really lovely flavor.  Thanks, BA!Spatula City 123Los Angeles, CA3/26/2021This recipe is excellent!  I followed it exactly.  I don't know how a recipe can be reviewed accurately if it is not followed.  I got 24 meatballs out of mine.  Yes, the romesco sauce is meant to be room temperature, and is the bomb!  The meatballs tasted similar to Mexican chorizo to me and were a definite winner.  I served this meal with roasted green beans and it was perfect.  I can't wait to make this recipe again and would love to turn this into a meatball sandwich at some point as well.  AnonymousNY3/17/2021Every so often I make a recipe because it is just so unusual and I cannot get my head wrapped around the flavor mix.  This was one of those times and I love the results.  I used what I had on hand so I substituted ground chicken.  I am not a fan of cumin so I used a curry powder that had a tiny bit of cumin.  The results were amazing!  I will definitely use this sauce with other meats and veggies.  It was so easy to make that I could easily do this for family events with a dozen people.\nJamileAtlanta3/15/2021My husband loved this recipe so much that next time he was at the store, he bought a two-pound bottle of roasted red peppers so that I could make this recipe again and double the sauce.  I made this once following the recipe exactly and a second time with a couple of changes.  For the meatballs, I doubled the spices.  For the Romesco sauce, I added one-half teaspoon of smoked paprika (actually since I was doubling the sauce, I added a full teaspoon).  I'm not sure if the sauce is supposed to be served hot or room temperature, but I warmed it up. MaryDeeLaguna Hills, CA3/9/2021This was great, and so easy! A few mods: I used pork instead of turkey and didn\u2019t have paprika so I used cayenne in the meatballs in place of that. For the sauce I used half the amount of olive oil, and I think I could probably use a tad less next time. I also cooked the meatballs in my airfryer (first time for me!) and they turned out fantastic! Topped with some parm, arugula, and pepper. Perfect chill weekend meal! Will add to my rotation if BA recipes :) AlexandraVancouver, BC 2/28/2021I made this as written and thought the cumin was a bit overpowering. Also, I'd use less olive oil in the romesco sauce.CeoraAnnapolis MD2/25/2021I enjoyed this recipe. You can\u2019t get much simpler than this sauce. I poured the sauce over the meatballs and heated to serve. Served over risotto and it felt comforting and hearty, even though it is pretty healthy and light. \nI didn\u2019t brown the meatballs in a pan, just roasted them in a hot oven and hit them with a broiler at the end. Katie2/23/2021Wonderful recipe. Followed Bendway\u2019s modifications. Served over Gnocchi. *chef\u2019s kiss*slaughterwaterSan Diego, CA2/22/2021This recipe was excellent but I modified it slightly.  Did the meatballs as directed but substituted ground chicken and made them larger (I had eight to a pound).  Browned them in a cast iron pan, which then went into the oven.  Made the sauce as directed but added about 2 tablespoons of heavy cream to lighten it (mine was much darker red than in the photo) and add richness.  When the meatballs came out of the oven I poured the Romescu sauce over them and brought to a simmer for a few minutes. Grated lemon zest over them at finish. Served with some rigatoni.  bendwaychampaign, IL2/21/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titMeatballBell PepperVegetableAlmondNutGround TurkeyTurkeyPoultryQuickEasyWeeknight MealsMainGluten-FreeHealthyishDinnerRecipes you want to make.
