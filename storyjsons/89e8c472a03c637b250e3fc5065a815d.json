I love any recipe where you can get in more veggies. Next time I make it I might add a couple tablespoons of tomato paste to make the sauce a little thicker but it really was delicious exactly as writtenAnonymousDenver, CO11/29/2020This was very easy and very tasty! \nMy family enjoyed it. I used canned diced tomatoes in basil and lemon peppered rotisserie. BeeOrlando, FL11/10/2020Very easy to try. Beginner friendly lol. Ritz80California7/26/2020I was kinda disappointed by this recipe. The chicken ended up super soggy, and the tomato wasn't flavorful to me. Maybe I did wrong, but I don't think so.AnonymousLos Angeles, CA4/17/2020This was awesome! Really easy and tasty. We used lacinto kale which I find not as tough to eat. So good!AnonymousLos Angeles4/8/2020Just made this except with a whole chicken butchered into pieces. It was SO GOOD and easy! I closed the lid on my Dutch oven and put it in the oven for 350F for 30-45 min. I ladled the broth over orzo and it was delicious and hearty without being heavy like beef stew. h.wongChicago, IL4/2/2020This is stupidly good and stupidly easy. I was pleasantly surprised how tasty this was. Great weekday meal! AnonymousIdaho3/10/2020This one was one of the easiest and most delicious meals I've ever made! Anonymous12/7/2019I modified this a bit and it was great. Broiled the chicken to crisp up the skin, put the kale in the sauce, chicken on top and didn't cover. Unfortunately, I didn't have bacon and it was still delicious. Chicken was nearly falling off the bones. Definitely will use bacon next time! Woodbury, CT4/13/2019My whole family loved this. Quick and delicious. Made the recipe exactly as is. The kale was delicious in the rich broth. I only left the chicken in long enough to heat it back up. Next time will serve with a loaf of crusty bread.AnonymousDenver1/28/2019I had to modify this for my kale hating husband. I used a 10 ounce bag of baby spinach which I randomly tore. When I was grocery shopping for the ingredients (which were on the list I left at home) I thought there were also cherry tomatoes. So, having them, I added about 1 1/2 cups of halved cherry tomatoes along with the spinach. I agree with a previous review that the skin, especially on the breast was soggy but presented well and easily came off the meat. Would definitely make this again.AnonymousNashua NH1/27/2019The tomatoes need to cook longer. The skin on chicken gets soggy. Any help with that? It didn't really enhance my rotisserie chicken, just cooked it way more.AnonymousCalifornia1/25/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titChickenPoultryBaconCured MeatMeatKaleLeafy GreensVegetableCanned TomatoTomatoFallWinterQuickEasyWeeknight MealsOne-Pot MealsMainDairy-FreeNut-FreeGluten-FreeKetoBraiseDinnerRecipes you want to make.
