See our past recommendations here!Tahini is often a great sub for peanut butter in cookies, brownies, smoothies, and sauces. But there\u2019s one arena where tahini simply cannot measure up: straight out of the jar snacking. While even the most natural of peanut butters typically contain salt (and sometimes also a sweetener), the best tahinis are made from sesame seeds and sesame seeds alone. So unlike the peanut butter that someone has already gone through the trouble of pre-seasoning for me, you won\u2019t find me greedily dipping a spoon into a tub of tahini. Tahini is an ingredient; peanut butter is a meal.Enter Seedible, a \u201csesame butter\u201d that bills itself as a spreadable, spoonable alternative to peanut butter that isn\u2019t forbidden at day care. It has all of the earthy, bitter notes that I love in tahini, and the additions of salt and date powder make Seedible a ready-to-eat, savory-sweet spread\u2014no doctoring required. Although I\u2019m Team Creamy Peanut Butter, I find myself gravitating toward Seedible\u2019s crunchy variety, which contains whole sunflower seeds. Chocolate sesame butter is launching soon\u2014my smoothies are quaking in anticipation\u2014and all varieties are organic, gluten-free, vegan, and completely nut-free.Thanks to the addition of organic thickeners and emulsifiers, Seedible is also less runny than tahini and less inclined to separate in the jar. The texture still isn\u2019t a perfect swap for a thick nut butter, especially a highly processed one, and my guess is that a Seedible and jelly sandwich left sitting in a hot lunchbox for hours would be something of a messy affair. But I\u2019ve been storing my jar in the refrigerator, where it emerges thick enough to hold its own slicked onto apple slices or a piece of toast. Then again, who needs bread? I\u2019ll eat it straight off a spoon.Photograph by Emma FishmanSeedible Organic Sesame Butter, Crunchy$10 at Bubble Goods$8 at Thrive MarketPhotograph by Emma FishmanSeedible Organic Sesame Butter, Creamy$10 at Bubble Goods$18 at Amazon (Pack of 2)Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish Loves ItShoppingTahiniRead MorecultureI'll Never Run Out of Alt Milk Thanks to This ConcentrateBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
