I used no chicken Better than Bouillon Base instead of water. I didn't have fresh rosemary or parsley on hand so instead, I used dried Italian seasoning. The noodles did absorb the broth so after reading all these comments, I know for next time to cook the noodles separately and add them to the bowl. This will be a dish we have over and over. Note: everyone in my family are meat-eaters (besides me) and didn't even miss that at all!Melissa JLos Angeles, CA2/9/2022My husband raved about this recipe - I honestly don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever had so many good things to say about a dish. Guess I\u2019ll add it to the rotation! The only change I made was to use 2 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of water. I used rigatoni and it took a bit longer than expected to cook, but a little patience is all we needed!AnonymousDenver, CO1/26/2022I found this while scrolling through the BA chickpea collection. I used dry chickpeas from the local CSA, soaked overnight and boiled, and San Marzano tomatoes from a can instead of fresh. This is now my favorite vegetarian meal. Just the right amount of flavor and complexity to make it a perfect meal for kids and adults alike. I do not think the Parmesan is really necessary if one wants to avoid milk products.  Michael Liberty Lake, WA1/22/2022\\this recipe is a huge family favourite, easy, high in flavour and economical!!!Colleen SimpsonSt. John's, Newfoundland Canada1/20/2022This is delicious and pantry-friendly! My 2-year old loved as well. Cooked a big batch of chickpeas and it was perfect use for some of them. Great for lunch leftovers, although the pasta does soak up the broth and soften as it sits. So if you're planning on eating over multiple days, you may want to consider cooking + storing the pasta separately, in that case. We added some chopped chicken sausage during onion/garlic stage, and a few handfuls of spinach just before serving. I always add extra red pepper flakes to mine!SammiSeattle, WA1/18/2022Awesome dish that will become a staple - used what I had on hand because I wanted to make a quick meal. Didn\u2019t have canned tomatoes so I used the tomato paste tip, dry rosemary because I didn\u2019t have fresh and didn\u2019t have parsley. I boosted the red pepper flakes, added a tiny splash of soy sauce maybe a teaspoon and a half, and about 3 tbsp of nutritional yeast instead of parmesan only because it was handy and easy and not  because I wanted to make it vegan intentionally. Didn\u2019t have small pasta so broke spaghetti noodles in thirds. All those adjustments and this was so delicious - can\u2019t wait to make it again!AngieLos Angeles 8/23/2021The only change I made to the recipe was to use black beans instead of chickpeas. It was very tasty, quick and easy. A great weekday meal with a salad on the side.\nBevMontreal7/26/2021At first, I was disappointed with this dish and I wasn't looking forward to the leftovers. But those leftovers were fantastic! I highly recommend letting this dish sit in the fridge overnight and reheating. The flavors really come together. I used dry chickpeas and instead of the water, I used the bean broth from the chickpeas (chicken stock with 1/2 lemon, bay leaf, and a serrano pepper). Also, this was easily 3 servings for me and could have been 4 with a side dish. AlyssaPhiladelphia, PA7/13/2021This is good.  It's super delicious if you use the chickpeas and broth from BA's best chickpea recipe.  I usually double the recipe.  I usually cook the pasta separately because I like the dish more brothy and the noodles less soft, but it's good as written.  KristineSanta Clarita, CA7/10/2021Love love this dish\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b\ud83c\udf7d\ud83c\udf7d\ud83c\udf7d.  I make it often. AnonymousCanada5/14/2021I absolutely loved this dish.  I used Rancho Gordo garbanzo beans and add a vegan bouillon to the water. Served with parm, a drizzle of olive oil and black pepper Cierra N. Georgia4/29/2021Fabulous and ridiculously simple meal to put together.  I used no salt in this recipe whatsoever, and subbed the water with Low-Sodium Chicken broth. All prepped hours in advance other than dropping in the Orecchiette.  This satisfying tweak on Minnestrone serves 3 easily!ChefJeffSherman Oaks, Californa4/26/2021Fast, easy, delicious! I made a few changes, half the water substituted with chicken broth, basil instead of rosemary, used Mini Farfalle and added 2 tablespoons of tomato paste.Mary AnnShelton, CT4/12/2021Really enjoyed this! I made it vegan by omitting the Parmesan cheese. To make up for this lack of salt, I used veggie broth in place of the water and also added about 1.5 tbsp of minced capers at the same time as the tomatoes. I used basil instead of the rosemary and parsley, and also stirred in some finely chopped kale at the end too. I recommend watching the recipe video for some other helpful tricks like mashing some of the chickpeas! Will be making again!KatVancouver 3/1/2021I quadrupled this for our 7 person household but didn't put quite as much water in, 12 cups was plenty. Lots of leftovers so definitely a generous recipe! This is a good basic recipe for a weeknight meal, a simpler and faster version of a Pasta e Fagioli, I love Carla's recipe for that and would recommend making that if you have more time SiiriLondon, UK2/1/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titPastaSoupSoups and StewsChickpeaBeanVegetableCanned TomatoTomatoOrecchiettePasta & NoodlesQuickEasyOne-Pot MealsWeeknight MealsMainVegetarianNut-FreeHealthyishSaut\u00e9SimmerDinnerRecipes you want to make.
