Platters, Bowls, and Utensils You Need to Host a Proper Dinner PartyBecause food served from a proper platter just tastes better.By Alex DelanyNovember 30, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailChelsie CraigFacebookTwitterEmailYou\u2019re past paper plates and plastic forks. By this point you\u2019ve been cooking (and eating) long enough to know that the platters, bowls, and utensils used to serve a meal are (almost) as important as the food itself\u2014and even more so when you're having people over. The real-real? You need to invest in some gear if you want to up your dinner party game.But you don\u2019t need to have a ton of stuff! Or even expensive stuff! You can get by with a pretty lean list of dinner party essentials. Oh, you\u2019re curious as to what might be on that list? Yeah, we\u2019ll share. Here\u2019s everything you need to throw the raddest dinner party your friends have ever been to:Chelsie CraigA Salad BowlYeah, you know about vegetables. Your friends know about vegetables. So you\u2019re definitely going to serve a salad at your dinner party. Salads are easy! And a great way to get some brightness and color on the table. The salad bowl you\u2019re serving out of should be big. You want enough room to dress the salad in the bowl before you serve it. We like a wooden bowl with a finish, which protects that beautiful wood grain from your acidic (but delicious) dressing.Buy It: Providence Wooden Salad Bowl, $49 from Williams Sonoma.Chelsie CraigA PlatterWhether you spent twenty minutes or three hours on your main course, you want it to look good. Which means you want it on a platter. The world is full of platters, but we gravitate towards a simple white platter with enough of a lipped edge to contain the tasty sauces hanging out under whatever you\u2019re serving for dinner.Buy It: Black Clay Round Platter, $18 from CB2.Chelsie CraigA Deep Shallow Pasta BowlAnd for the stuff that a platter can\u2019t handle, there\u2019s the serving bowl. We\u2019re mostly talking about pasta here. People love pasta. And we like pleasing people, so you\u2019ll catch us serving pasta at a dinner party pretty frequently, especially something with a simple sauce that comes together quickly.Buy It: White Serving Bowl, $14 from CB2.Chelsie CraigServing SpoonsServing spoons separate the children from the adults. Sure, you could just use the fork that was placed at your seat, but having a spoon that\u2019s big enough to serve chicken thighs and scoop up the juices below will make everyone significantly happier. Plus, your friend is getting over a cold, so let\u2019s keep our germs to ourselves, shall we?Buy It: Stainless Steel 3pc. Serving Set, $8 from Target.Salad TongsRemember when you put that big wooden bowl of salad on the table? Yeah, you need some serving utensils for that nutritious masterpiece, and a normal-sized fork and spoon from the depths of your cutlery drawer won\u2019t do. Grab a pair of salad tongs to pick up those leafy greens.Buy It: Olivewood 2-Piece Salad Serving Set, $24 from Crate and Barrel.Dip Bowls (parm, pesto, dips, etc.)If you\u2019re not dipping something into something else, you\u2019re probably not at a dinner party. Dip bowls hold the dinner party snack hour essential: Dips. Duh. But they\u2019re also good for accompanying sauces and toppings like pesto, chile oil, or grated Parmesan cheese.Buy It: 4 Open Kitchen Dip Bowls, $12 from Williams Sonoma.Candle HoldersCandle holders should really be called vibe holders. That\u2019s what they do. They hold the vibes, especially when dinner is coming to a close and the after-dinner drinks are being poured. Whether you\u2019re going for a short tea or votive candle or a tall tapered candle, having a set of matching holders makes the vibes glow even stronger.Buy It: Bronn Taper Candle Holder, $6 from CB2.Ice BucketRoom temperature beverages are tough to sell. Cold ones? Those fly off the shelves, which is why you need an ice bucket. Whether you\u2019re working with a 30-rack of Budweiser or some naturally sparkling wine (or both!), you want a tub with some serious volume. And please, don\u2019t empty all the ice in and then add the drinks. Fill the tub with drinks, give them space to breathe, and then empty the ice on top, so it fills in all the cracks.Buy It: Hammered Metal Beverage Tub, $24 from Target.Chelsie CraigWater PitcherHydration is key. For health. For life in general. But also for dinner parties. You don\u2019t want people running to the kitchen every time they\u2019re feeling thirsty. Keeping a pitcher of water on the table for easy access is the professional move. A simple glass pitcher is best. If anyone needs ice, they know where the ice bucket is.Buy It: Trap Water Pitcher, $14 from CB2.Chelsie CraigCloth Napkins/Dish TowelsYou don\u2019t have to spring for the ultra-fancy, hand-dyed linen napkins, but you definitely shouldn\u2019t be putting a paper towel next to the plates on your table. Cloth napkins that can double as dish towels? Yeah, that sounds about our speed. Picking up a bunch of multipurpose pieces of cloth on the cheap makes dinner more impressive and cleaning up a hell of a lot easier.Buy It: 30 White Kitchen Towels, $28 from Amazon.Want more kitchen upgrades? These cost less than 25 bucks:25 Kitchen Upgrades for Under $25Because you're worth it.View StoryAll products featured on bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
