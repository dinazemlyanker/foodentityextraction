But thanks to restrictive pandemic border policies and plain-old nostalgia, lately I\u2019ve been craving home and going hard on these iconic toasted sandwiches from my Australian childhood.Each sanga, as we call \u2019em, comes together in a jaffle maker, an electric cooking appliance somewhat similar (in both theory and name) to a waffle iron. Here\u2019s how it works: (1) Butter or mayo the outside of two pieces of bread and fill them with delicious foods. (2) Load your sandwich between the hinged, nonstick, concave plates. (3) Close the press, which clamps down on the bread, simultaneously warming the filling, toasting the outsides, sealing the crusts, and dividing the sandwich into two neat triangles. All this while you do a little jaffle jig in the kitchen.Photo by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Pearl JonesCuisinart Jaffle Sandwich Press$25 at Amazon$25 at TargetBefore you roll your eyes at buying a single-use appliance\u2014although people do make French toast and omelets in their jaffle makers\u2014consider the platonic toastie. It\u2019s golden and crispy on the outside, warm and tender on the inside, perfectly contained in a handheld pouch, and ideally angled for dunking in tiny ramekins of aioli, ketchup (known ONLY as tomato sauce in Oz), or mayonnaise. You can think of it like a lazy man\u2019s pizza pocket or meat pie\u2014which is also how you know the jaffle maker is an Australian invention. Who has time to toil over flaky pastry when the surf\u2019s up, my dudes?Bondi-based doctor Ernest Smithers, the same gent who invented the surfoplane (a kind of inflatable rubber boogie board), is credited with popularizing and patenting the jaffle maker in 1949. Smithers\u2019 original version, often referred to as a pie iron in the U.S., was a metal contraption with long handles for holding over a flame or barbecue. Later, in 1974, Sydney-based brand Breville released the first electric jaffle maker\u2014the Snack \u2018n\u2019 Sandwich Toaster\u2014which, supposedly, 10% of Australian households owned within its first year on the market.When I was growing up, jaffles were the ideal route to easy dinners or fridge clean-outs. We ate them stuffed with cheddar, baked beans, and Vegemite; ham and pineapple or banana; leftover Bolognese and parm; tinned spaghetti and mozzarella; rotisserie chicken with avo and Swiss cheese; and banana and Nutella. But there are no hard-and-fast rules when it comes to making jaffles, except this one: Though you\u2019ll be tempted, don\u2019t overfill your sandwich or it\u2019ll explode like a mini volcano.Though the name, jaffle, isn\u2019t always the same, the sealed sandwich has traveled around the world, making it Australia\u2019s greatest cultural contribution (you know, aside from Milo, Tim Tams, Vegemite, and various other national treasures). My colleagues Rachel Gurjar and Antara Sinha grew up eating Bombay sandwiches, an Indian riff stuffed with variations like spiced potatoes and peas; crumbled paneer; and cucumber, tomato, and cheese with chutney. The Brits call them toasted sandwiches (so creative). And in South Africa you\u2019ll find snackwiches or jaffles stuffed with savory mince that are often still made in the pie iron over direct heat.Of course, not all electric jaffle makers are created equal. The ones available in the U.S. typically aren\u2019t concave enough to handle loads of filling (unlike the Breville Big One Sandwich Maker that Aussies can buy). But I do love the two-toasties-at-a-time Cuisinart, which, at 9.07x8.87\", is smaller than most hardcover cookbooks. It features all the good stuff: nonstick plates, a clamp that locks shut, sensor lights to tell you when your sandwich is done, and raised ridges to avoid overflow in the likely event you don\u2019t heed my aforementioned advice.On those nights when the sanga\u2019s siren song is strong, you\u2019ll find me methodically buttering bread in my kitchen. I\u2019ll open a can of beans, spoon on a layer, add a sprinkle of cheese, sneak a salty lick of straight Vegemite, and let the jaffle maker take it from there. At under $30, it\u2019s a cheap ticket home.Bombay Sandwiches are calling:Bombay SandwichChef Preeti Mistry\u2019s Bombay Sandwich is like a \u201cgrown-up grilled cheese,\u201d made with jammy onions, potatoes, melty Monterey Jack, tangy cheddar, and Scallion Chutney.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make.
