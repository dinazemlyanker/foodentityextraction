I love Italy. Ever since watching Eat Pray Love, an excellent film by the way, I\u2019ve been obsessed with The Boot. I was last there in 2019 with my mom\u2014she\u2019s the sensitive and romantic Elizabeth Gilbert and I\u2019m the overeager and food obsessed Luca Spaghetti\u2014and we traipsed through Tuscany and Lake Como and Umbria, filling our fanny packs with truffle paste and tinned anchovies. When I got home, I immediately started taking Italian lessons, spending all my money at Gustiamo.com, and lurking wistfully on the Italian answer to Zillow, Idealista.So, it will probably not surprise you to learn that my favorite rice is Acquerello\u2014a carnaroli variety typically used in risotto, grown and milled by the Rondolino family in a perfectly romantic-looking village in Piedmont. The name Acquerello, thank you so much for asking, means \u201cwatercolor\u201d in Italian (because rice is grown in water!). Both the 17.6-oz. tin and the honkin\u2019 human-baby-size sack feature a delightful likeness of the 17th-century farm\u2019s original manor house. I\u2019d be lying if I said the packaging wasn\u2019t a huge draw; I love shiny things.If you, like me, have survived the last year on copious amounts of carbohydrates, you need Acquerello in your life. Heston Blumenthal, Britain\u2019s culinary renaissance man best known for his science- and sensory-forward cooking, called it \u201cthe best rice in the world.\u201d And this self-anointed Italian connoisseur (me) agrees. Acquerello\u2019s magic lies in its unique, patented (!) processing method: After aging for a year in temperature-controlled silos, the sugars in the starches develop into a nutty sweetness and the grains harden, which means they\u2019re less absorbent and won\u2019t turn your risotto into sludge.\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating; each kernel is remarkably smooth,\u201d I told my thoroughly disinterested boyfriend, who, late one night found me inspecting the tiny pearls with a magnifying glass. To avoid damaging the rice during whitening\u2014a process whereby grains are usually passed through two abrasive, mechanized surfaces to remove the germ and bran\u2014Acquerello uses a gentle tumbling process that grinds the kernels against one another instead. Most carnaroli producers would discard the germ that gives brown rice its color and nutritious reputation, but the Rondolinos are not most. They heat the fibrous leftovers in a way that allows them to recoat the kernels, so Acquerello cooks like a white rice but is packed with all the vitamins and minerals of brown rice.Looking for a second, bona fide Italian opinion, and eager to make my Italian tutor, Milena, proud, I emailed chef Gabriele Boffa, who has been using Acquerello rice for three years at Locanda del Sant\u2019Uffizio, a Michelin-starred hotel and restaurant in the northwestern province of Asti. (I\u2019d heard of the palatial resort while I was visiting and have added it to my future travel itinerary.) \u201cWith the production technique, the rice maintains a good resistance to overcooking and offers a very pleasant grain structure under the teeth,\u201d he explained IN ITALIAN. While Boffa mostly uses the rice for Locanda\u2019s creamy red pepper and black olive risotto, he says it\u2019s super versatile. Now that I have prepared it in a rice cooker, on the stove, and in the oven, I can confirm that Aquerello is hard to botch.These days, while pleasures are still few, I savor my precious grains. Instead of blowing through the 5.5-lb. bag in a few dinners, I like to ration it out; making tomatoey risotto, cheesy arancini, and pea-flecked risi e bisi whenever I need a little Italy in New York. And instead of wolfing it down in front of the TV, I take my bowl and a bottle of Chianti to the bathroom, pour an epsom-salted tub, and pretend the splashes are sounds of the Tyrrhenian Sea lapping a pebbly shore. Inevitably, the wine disappears and the bath turns cold and I\u2019m still in my apartment, but then I remember that there\u2019s plenty more rice in the sack.Photo by Emma FishmanAcquerello Rice, 5.5 Pound Bag$37 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendShoppingRecipes you want to make.
