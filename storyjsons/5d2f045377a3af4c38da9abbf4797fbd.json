Reduce heat to maintain an active simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until shallots and garlic are golden brown, 14\u201317 minutes. Remove solids from oil with a slotted spoon and transfer them to a plate. Discard allspice and ginger. Add chiles to oil and return saucepan to medium heat. Toast, stirring constantly, until chiles just begin to darken, about 1 minute. Transfer chiles to the same plate; add sesame seeds to oil and set oil aside.\u00a0Step 2Pulse chiles in a food processor until finely chopped, adding some of the cooking oil as needed to loosen it. Combine chopped chiles in a large jar with shallots and garlic, and remaining oil. Add agave and season with salt.\u00a0Step 3Do Ahead: Chile crisp can be made 1 month ahead. Cover and chill.Rice and AssemblyStep 4Heat 1 Tbsp. ghee in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add brussels sprout leaves and cook, tossing occasionally, until lightly charred and crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate.\u00a0Step 5Add 1 Tbsp. ghee to same skillet followed by stuffing. Press stuffing across bottom of skillet in an even layer and cook, undisturbed, until browned, about 4 minutes. Toss a few times and continue to cook, tossing often, until stuffing is broken down into lightly browned bits, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer to plate with brussels sprouts.\u00a0Step 6Heat 1 Tbsp. ghee in skillet. Cook ginger, garlic, and 4 scallions, stirring, until softened, about 1 minute. Add eggs and cook, stirring often, until mostly set, about 30 seconds. Add rice and toss to combine. Add remaining ghee along edge of skillet so it runs down between rice and skillet. Cook, without disturbing, until rice is crackling and has formed a crisp layer against bottom of skillet, about 2 minutes. Toss, breaking up any clumps with a spoon, and continue to cook until rice is hot and crispy-chewy, about 3 minutes longer. Add stuffing and brussels sprouts back to pan and toss to combine; season with soy sauce or salt.\u00a0Step 7Transfer rice mixture to a platter. Top with sesame seeds and/or corn nuts and more sliced scallions. Serve chile crisp alongside.How would you rate Cornbread Stuffing Fried Rice?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (4)Back to TopTriangleAmazing! I used leftover cornbread dressing from last year\u2019s Thanksgiving & it was incredible. My husband can\u2019t stop eating it lol. I\u2019m definitely making this a regular for Thanksgiving. I love cornbread dressing and this recipe adds another dimension to it without sacrificing any of the traditional flavors. The only thing I\u2019d change is the amount of oil. I think when I make it for Thanksgiving, I\u2019ll fry up the crispees that go on top in less oil. I think I\u2019ll probably add more brussel sprouts too. Other than those two minor changes, I wouldn\u2019t change a thing. It\u2019s a fantastic recipe. Megan MontagueCalifornia 8/28/2021This is so good, it's ridiculous. I've made it twice, and I'm gonna make it again. So deeply flavorful (especially with the chili crisp) and satisfying for any meal. I can't recommend it enough.marsmilusGeorgia12/12/2019Soul Satisfying! It really itched my ethnic food craving after an all-american T-Day dinner. I didn't want to go through the process of making the Chili Crisps (yet) so I subbed \"Lao Ganma\" Chili Oil I had sitting in the fridge, and swapped the brussels sprouts for peas. Not really true to the recipe, but the recipe itself is a riff on another recipe so I don't feel too bad, heh. AnonymousNew York12/3/2019Delicious! So refreshing and different. Stuffing is my favorite thanksgiving side, my boyfriend doesn't care for it. This made both of us happy. I ended up crisping more Brussels sprouts leaves as a garnish because I had more sprouts and I wanted something bright in color to add to the top. We had a lot of leftovers, so we froze some. I think it should reheat well and be a fun and easy weeknight reheat in a few weeks.AnonymousMassachusetts11/29/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titFried RiceBrussels SproutVegetableRiceRice & GrainsMainSideFryThanksgivingRecipes you want to make.
