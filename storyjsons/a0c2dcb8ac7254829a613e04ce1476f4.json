While some people spend their time on beauty tutorials or dog videos, I\u2019ll go down a deep rabbit hole of restaurants, wine shops, and boutiques until I\u2019m practically booking a trip to a new city 15 clicks past the explore page.That\u2019s exactly how I found myself on a flight to Kelowna, British Columbia, my Instagram-curated home base for exploring the little-known (in the U.S., anyways) wine region of the Okanagan Valley. After 30 minutes of double tapping and scrolling through people and places in Vancouver, I landed on Juice Bar\u2014a natural wine bar that also serves pizza and feels like the kind of place every BA editor would spend their weekends. I whizzed past natural wines I drink in Brooklyn all the time but paused when I started seeing unfamiliar ones\u2014longneck Rieslings with amber-hued wines labeled \u201cScout\u201d; cloudy bubbles in a mysterious bottle; red-orange vermouth that was far from Spanish\u2014it was all from the Okanagan. Add in a google image search promising lush mountains and sunsets that look like a van Gogh painting over sparkling turquoise lakes, and I was ready to pack up my wine-tasting notebook and hit the road.Grapevines for days in the Okanagan Valley.\nPhoto by Julian CousinsSettling into seat 2E for my 45-minute flight from Seattle, I attempted to crack open a book. But my neighbor in 2F had other plans. A BC native, he was thrilled to hear it was going to be my first time there and pointed my attention outside the window the entire flight as we cascaded over those mountaintops, and wispy clouds revealed blue-green bodies of water for miles\u2013er, kilometers\u2014below us.If it hadn\u2019t all been so beautiful, and if he hadn\u2019t been so genuinely excited, it may have been annoying. But I quickly found out that this was the BC way. Locals are incredibly proud of the natural beauty, the bounty of juicy peaches and cherries that\u2019ll stain your fingers deep red, and wineries as far as the eye can see.The lakes in the Okanagan Valley moderate temperatures, meaning nights in the summer are cool and winters are less harsh than other regions of Canada. The snow that does fall acts as an insulate to the vines in the winter, preventing lots of winter damage. During the growing season, when the days are warm and the nights are cool, the vines undergo photosynthesis during the sunnier hours of the day, producing sugar that affects how much alcohol and body the resulting wine has. At night, when it\u2019s cooler, that rapid photosynthesis doesn\u2019t happen. This natural temperature control is what allows the Okanagan to produce its characteristic high-acid wines.Grapes ready to be crushed.\nPHOTO BY JULIAN COUSINSBecause the terroir shifts so drastically from town to town in the Okanagan, getting to visit feels like taking a trip to Bordeaux, the Finger Lakes, Tuscany, and even Georgia (the country) all at once. With 185 licensed grape wineries spread out over four [FC] distinct microclimates, all producing their own interesting wines, I had to narrow down my must-see list somehow. So I decided to visit only places making natural wines, which appeal to both my taste buds and my sensibilities. To me, natural wines are some of the most exciting bottles being made in the world right now. While the Okanagan is traditionally known for conventional winemaking, I met producers who are making a conscious effort to undo the ways of conventional winemaking\u2019s past. You can see, feel, and taste the passion they have for this process, whether it\u2019s in a tannic skin-contact white that grips your tongue or a light-bodied red that feels like the winemaker is tossing a ripe berry right into your mouth.No TSA lines? Blasting Stevie Nicks on the rental-car radio as you drive past crystal clear lakes? An incredibly dynamic range of grapes and natural wines to taste my way through? This trip certainly lived up to my expectations and then some. As I discovered during my visit, the reason I had never come across any Okanagan wines in Juice Bar\u2013type spots in New York is because it\u2019s difficult to export them to the U.S., and each Okanagan producer makes only a small amount that mostly gets distributed to Vancouver and Calgary\u2014in order to taste them, you have to go to the source. If that fact (plus all the Okanagan pics on my Instagram feed) has you ready to book a trip yourself, here are the five wineries you need on your itinerary.5 Must-Visit Natural Wineries in British Columbia\u2019s Okanagan ValleyJay Drysdale and Wendy Rose specialize in sparkling wine at Bella.\nPhoto by Julian CousinsBellaWhen I was scheduling my visits to wineries, basically everyone\u2019s first question was, \u201cYou\u2019re going to Bella, right?\u201d After hearing co-owners and married couple Jay Drysdale and Wendy Rose\u2019s story, I\u2019m so glad I did. For sparkling-wine-heads, this is your place. And even if you only drink bubbles during a celebration, being at Bella feels like you\u2019re inside the mind of a scientist, where the control group is a cluster of deep purple Gamay grapes and the experimental group is to decide which method of sparkling winemaking to use.They practice three different styles of sparkling winemaking, including the m\u00e9thode ancestrale or p\u00e9tillant-naturel (a.k.a. p\u00e9t-nat), in which a semi-sparkling wine is bottled before the first fermentation is complete, resulting in lighter bubbles; m\u00e9thode traditionelle, the two-step bottle fermentation process traditionally used to make Champagne; and trad-nat, a term Jay and Wendy made up to show that you can make beautiful and electric traditional method sparkling wine but without adding anything to the actual wine.When you line up their portfolio, it looks like cotton-candy rainbow-bright pinks and raspberry reds and soft yellows. Make sure to try the Vineyard Series sparkling ros\u00e9, which showcases the high-acid grapes of the Okanagan and tastes like a Paloma by the pool accompanied by a fresh tomato salad. Or there\u2019s the Gamay trad-nat, which looks like a lip stain Glossier is about to launch and tastes like the grown-up version of Capri Sun. (You know that feeling of victory when you\u2019d successfully poke the flimsy straw into the silver pack and take a refreshing sip after playing on the playground all day? Like that, but 21+.) Book a private tasting on Thursday or Friday, or drive up the Naramata Bench on Saturday or Sunday when their tasting room is open, to learn about sparkling wine from two people who have dedicated their lives to the bubbles.4320 Gulch Rd., Naramata, British Columbia V0H 1N1; appointment-only after August.Tantalus is a LEED-certified vineyard.\nPHOTO BY JULIAN COUSINSTantalusTake a drive about 20 minutes east from downtown Kelowna and you\u2019ll find yourself on a gravel driveway leading into Tantalus Vineyards. It\u2019s actually purposefully left unpaved to keep the temperatures surrounding the tasting room and cellar cooler. That\u2019s because Tantalus is a LEED-certified vineyard that puts as much emphasis on reducing its energy emissions, carbon footprint, and wastewater as it does on making delicious wines (with a wastewater management plant for the entire winery and tasting room to prove it).For the people who drink natural wine because of the environmental impact, come nerd out with David Paterson, the general manager. He\u2019ll point out the wastewater management plant when you stroll through the vineyard, which is open for tours every day from May to October. You\u2019ll walk through the 72-acre vineyard that has Riesling planted from 1978, but you\u2019ll also see the new grapes that Stephanie Mosley and Paterson planted when they took over the vineyards in 2005, like Chardonnay, Pinot Meunier, Pinot Noir, and Syrah. Taste through all of their wines, but make sure you buy a bottle of the old-vine Riesling to bring home with you for later. It\u2019s peachy and tart and has a mouthfeel that glides across your tongue\u2014kind of like eating gummy peach rings in your favorite silk robe.1670 DeHart Rd., Kelowna, British Columbia V1W 4N6; open daily, 10 a.m.-6 p.m. from May to October. Otherwise, seasonal hours apply.Echo BayAs soon as you get to Echo Bay, you\u2019ll feel a sense of familial warmth that radiates off the property\u2014like you\u2019ve been to Echo Bay a million times before. Then you\u2019ll see a dog or two, a flock of chickens, and winemaker Kelsey Rufiange probably waving you down with a bottle in one hand and two glasses in the other. Kelsey\u2019s grandfather bought the property in the 1960s as a family vacation home, and seven years ago the Rufianges turned it into a vineyard, planting Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re, Petit Verdot, and Sangiovese vines. Because Echo Bay is at the southernmost point of Skaha Lake, temperatures are much hotter than, say, at Tantalus Vineyards, which is why they can plant these Bordeaux-style grapes. (Like I said before, traveling around Lake Okanagan is like traveling to 10 different terroirs in one day.) As in Bordeaux, the soil here is sandy/silty loam and temperatures can get up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit during the summer.As you taste through these spicy, mouth-coating reds, ask Kelsey about her side project, Else Wines, which are 100 percent natural and 100 percent sourced from the Else Wines are zero-addition wines that are sourced from growers around Okanagan. Her first vintage went to market this past year, a Pinot Gris\u2013Riesling p\u00e9t-nat. It\u2019s so alive thanks to high acid, but brings you right back down to earth with notes of coconut and peach pits. She also has a skin-contact Muscat that\u2019s like finishing a whole box of Mike & Ike\u2019s in an air-conditioned movie theater (which you can find by the glass at Micro, a tapas joint in downtown Kelowna, if you can\u2019t make it to the vineyard). Kelsey\u2019s wines prove that the Okanagan is a place to watch, and while Bordeaux styles still reign supreme in this area of the valley, there are people that aren\u2019t afraid to take risks and try something new.224 Eastside Rd., Okanagan Falls, British Columbia V0H 1R5; call for a private appointment, +1 250-490-6228. InstagramThe grapes for the wines at TH Wines come from the southern part of the valley.\nPHOTO BY JULIAN COUSINSTH WinesOn the west side of the lake, you\u2019ll find Summerland, which is the town that Tyler Harlton makes his wine in. He\u2019ll probably tell you it\u2019s actually \u201cCarstentown.\u201d (That\u2019s because he makes his wine in a garage surrounded by a woodworking shop and a newly opened brewery, all owned by his landlord Carsten.) Harlton sources his sustainably grown grapes from South Okanagan, which is at the very bottom of the Okanagan Valley. It\u2019s hot during the day and cool at night, which produces the iconic high-acid grapes known to BC. Come by the winery to hang out with Tyler, who will casually give you a homemade peach Viognier ice pop, an assortment of cheese and crackers, and a tour of the facility.Just like their maker, Tyler\u2019s wines feel effortlessly chill, from the slightly effervescent Riesling to a Pinot Noir which on the nose, is a ripe blackberry. And if it\u2019s been released by the time you make it out there, snag a bottle of his new Malbec. I\u2019m not normally a fan of the variety, but everything I thought I knew about Malbec, the weighty grape that normally dries my mouth out faster than a peanut butter sandwich, was turned upside down when I tried Tyler\u2019s take on it. The rush of fresh raspberries up front is lifted by a bit of volatile acidity, and the whole peppercorn notes at the end remind you that, yeah, this is still a Malbec. And when you talk to every other person in the Okanagan making thoughtful wines, you won\u2019t be surprised to hear that they\u2019ve worked with or for Tyler in some capacity. He has a strong commitment to British Columbia, and just because he\u2019s not rooted in a vineyard doesn\u2019t mean this doesn\u2019t come through in everything he does.#1-9576 Cedar Avenue, Summerland, British Columbia, V0H 1Z2; open daily, 11 a.m.\u20135 p.m. from Easter to mid-October.Bottles from Keenan's side project that he makes at Sage Hills Vineyard.\nPhoto by Julian CousinsSage HillsTen minutes from TH Wines is Sage Hills, an eight-acre vineyard run by Keenan Thrussell and Zo\u00eb Jacoe. The Sage Hills story is similar to Else Wines, in that Keenan\u2019s father bought the vineyard later in life, but had been farming organically since day one. As you sip their skin-contact Pinot Gris and look through the sage brush surrounding the vineyard, you\u2019ll get a view of the entire property. The tasting room is open every day, but also schedule some time with vineyard manager Keenan and vineyard assistant Zo\u00eb, both of whom are so passionate about the farming they do.While Keenan manages the vineyard and makes all of the wines, he started sourcing grapes from other vineyards for his own side project that\u2019s 100 percent natural, and he released his first vintage last year. He uses the facilities at Sage Hills to press, ferment, and age this side project, simply called Keenan, which if you\u2019re lucky, you can taste while you\u2019re there too. (Just ask, he\u2019s very nice!) He has a skin-contact Sauvignon Blanc that\u2019s like peeling open a fresh tangerine, and it made me scour the internet for adjectives similar to thrilling. (I settled on rip-roaring and bracing due to the volatile acidity that makes your mouth water for more.) Finding 100 percent organic fruit isn\u2019t an easy task, and Keenan has become a springboard for other winemakers in the area to bounce ideas off of. In a wine region with a lot of overlap, Keenan is pushing the limits on what Canadian wine can and should be. It\u2019s working.18555 Matsu Dr., Summerland, British Columbia; open daily, 11 a.m.\u20135 p.m. from April 1 to December 1.We'll take one of each homemade loaf from Sprout.\nPhoto by Julian CousinsYou\u2019re going to need to sleep and eat while you\u2019re there too, right?Keeping your home base on the trip in Kelowna means you get to experience all of the produce and wine in the Okanagan from the best chefs there. I\u2019d suggest renting an Airbnb in downtown Kelowna, mostly so you can start your mornings at Sprout - Bread and Coffee every day. This bright, airy caf\u00e9 makes its own bread, so get one of the toasts and an Americano while admiring the floral arrangements and doing what people are supposed to do on vacation\u2014relaxing.You\u2019ll also be a 10-minute drive to Frankie, We Salute You!, a new vegetarian restaurant with not-trying-too-hard interior design and lots of local ingredients on the menu. Lucky for you that includes local vermouth, as Frankie\u2019s carries Shawn Dalton\u2019s new vermouth project, Marrow Vermouth. He\u2019s currently making the 18 percent ABV fortified wine in the Similkameen Valley, two hours south of Kelowna, at Scout Vineyard. And if you want to do something other than drink wine all day, we\u2019re probably not friends, but I\u2019d suggest taking a dip in Lake Okanagan. You can get in the water right there in downtown Kelowna, and if that\u2019s not your style, there are boat tours as well. If you\u2019re heading to the Okanagan in the winter, you\u2019re probably going to ski, in which case you should head to Big White. I\u2019ll leave that to you, as I\u2019m much more of a summer girl and will probably be too busy planning my next vacation I stumbled on via Instagram anyways.Want more on Canada?
