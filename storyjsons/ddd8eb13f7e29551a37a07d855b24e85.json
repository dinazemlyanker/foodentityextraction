It\u2019s worth it to commit the formula to memory: a bag of chips, a can of refried beans, maybe some leftover meat or roasted veg from the night before, shredded cheese, and some kind of quickly cooked, spiced veg like cauliflower or brussels sprouts. It\u2019s a lightning-fast lunch (or dinner) that can be tweaked to suit anyone\u2019s preferences.Ingredients2 servings1cup thinly sliced radishes, red onion, cabbage, carrots, or other firm vegetable\u00bdcup seasoned rice vinegar3Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided2garlic cloves, smashed\u00bdsmall head of cauliflower, halved through stem end, thinly sliced1tsp. ground coriander1tsp. ground cumin1tsp. paprikaKosher salt8oz. tortilla chips1cup refried beans (such as Amy\u2019s)8oz. sharp cheddar, coarsely gratedChopped avocado, cilantro leaves with tender stems, and plain yogurt (for serving)PreparationStep 1Toss radishes and vinegar in a small bowl to combine; set aside.Step 2Preheat oven to 400\u00b0.

Loved all the veggies, and the pickled radishes are choice. Adding shredded purple cabbage makes it even prettier to look at. From personal experience, this is a great single sheet pan dinner for two (hunched over the tray like two seagulls over a spilled pile of fries). Anonymous1/23/2022Awesome! We are satisfying full & happy for the pile of vegetables. \ud83d\ude01 The pickled veg was dead-simple, I made extra. They pretty much take the place of salsa. I used store bought crumbled cauliflower which was a bit too moist, I'll use a fresh head next time. Terri Heal Victoria, BC Canada 2/28/2021This is one I will use often. Can't wait to try it. \nI like the fact that it's meatless. \nKeep the recipes coming!!Jodi 2/9/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titNachosCauliflowerVegetableEasyQuickWeeknight MealsVegetarianNut-FreeLunchRecipes you want to make.
