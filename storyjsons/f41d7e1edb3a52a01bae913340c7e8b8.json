It's all about the dessing! I didn't know what to serve it with so I eat it with quinoa wich was good. MagQu\u00e9bec1/31/2022This was really delicious! Definitely a more than the sum of its parts recipe. I didn't have whole allspice, so used ground, and turned out fine.DaniSan Diego, CA1/15/2022Really delicious. Loved tearing the cabbage leaves and eating torn leaves. Then the flavor was really delicious. Had red cabbage so used that. The dressing  could probably be used on other vegetables.  Best easy veg prep in a long time.  Many thanks!LynnNYC1/5/2022delish, comes together easy w/ cheap ingredients and ends up being interesting flavours! loved it. Agree w/ comment below, cut the initial char time to a little shorter. Claire Asheville NC1/4/2022The dressing and flavors were delicious. However, the cooking time is too long for the cabbage, and finishing everything together in a covered pot with vegetable broth made this into a soggy cabbage soup. Next time I'll try charring on the BBQ and roasting the other veggies separetely.AnonymousLos Angeles1/3/2022This was delicious. I kept the cabbage ( I only red a red cabbage) in wedges and we ate it with grilled salmon.AnonymousOakland, CA1/3/2022This was so delicious we couldn\u2019t get enough. The flavor combinations lime juice, syrup and red pepper flakes was amazing!!! I made without the carrots. This is now my go to recipe for cabbage. AnonymousSummerfield NC1/2/2022I prefer eating vegetarian for most meals and love cabbage. I had most of the ingredients and picked up a carrot and some scallions at the store. Several days later I am hungry after work and decide to whip this together. \n\nIt's good! But it was only as I started putting together the dressing (lime juice and maple syrup??) that I was realizing this is an odd recipe. It hit the spot though, has a nice sweet, salty, savory combination, and was fast to make. \n\nEnjoy!KonstantinDurham, NC12/1/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titCabbageLeafy GreensVegetableCarrotDinnerVegetarianSideVeganRecipes you want to make.
