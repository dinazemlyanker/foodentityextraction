Read all the stories here.I usually don\u2019t like rules. But whenever my friends and I decide to hang out in one another\u2019s living rooms past 4 p.m. to eat good food, drink a gallon of boxed wine, and laugh (and cry) about everything going on in our lives, we abide by a single rule: Don\u2019t call it a dinner party. The term dinner party adds an unnecessary layer of stress. It makes me think of Martha Stewart\u2019s kitchen in the early \u201990s\u2014no shade, I love Martha and her flower-embellished frozen vodka\u2014but I am not her. And the thought of hosting, or even attending, an extravagantly dazzling dinner party makes me sweat.Get even more dinner party rules:ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.My favorite get-togethers are always the ones that satisfy everyone\u2019s appetite, exude a chill vibe, and induce zero pressure to impress others. Katherine Lewin, owner of the Brooklyn-based dinner party essentials shop, Big Night, agrees. That\u2019s why she recommends skipping the \u201cdinner\u201d part of dinner parties altogether\u2014and unleashing the potential of an epic cheese plate. \u201cI think there\u2019s something about dinner parties that feels constraining and somewhat theatrical,\u201d Lewin says. As a host, you\u2019re stressed about creating a menu and having everyone move through the meal at the same time. And as a guest, you\u2019re worried about saying all the right things, not lingering too long over each course, and whether or not you should assert your dietary preferences. Lewin argues that \u201cthe idea of a snack table, or a format that isn\u2019t a three-course dinner, gives people freedom and creates a relaxed environment so everyone can eat what and how they want.\u201dAs temperatures drop and cozy nights creep up on our social calendars, Lewin explains how she takes a simple cheese board from appetizer to main event. Here are her five best tips for creating a convention-defying snack table that is varied, delicious, and fun.Cheese, duh\u2014but also dips and a huge tin of fishObviously, cheese is a big component of any snack platter. When it comes to which varieties you should buy, Lewin loves the classic sweet and savory combo. Think red pepper jam with goat cheese, cherry jam with blue cheese, or strawberry jam with cheddar. But don\u2019t stop there. A charcuterie-esque dinner party is an opportunity to go beyond cured meats and cheeses and serve a bunch of items that are snacky and fun, but also filling. \u201cI like serving a great dip that can be used in multiple ways on the same table\u2014like a fresh green goddess for dunking crudit\u00e9s, roasted veg, or potato chips,\u201d she says. \u201cThen I mix that same dip into something like tinned tuna that people can then spread on bread or crackers.\u201dCanned seafood is definitely having a moment. Lewin suggests serving a variety of not-too-fancy-but-still-very-chic tins of sliced octopus, calamari, or codfish. \u201cIt\u2019s an experience in and of itself that\u2019s perfect for a dinner party,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause people get to taste their way through them and pick out their favorites. It\u2019s also a great way to add protein to the table.\u201dDon\u2019t have guests bring a dish. Do have them bring a condiment they\u2019d like everyone to try.Asking guests to bring an entire dish puts a lot of pressure on them\u2014which is not very chill unless it\u2019s a potluck and they know what they\u2019re getting into\u2014but serving all the food in a snack format allows everyone to bring a stand-alone item that they\u2019re passionate about and want to share with the group. We\u2019re talking cool condiments, like strawberry fig and chipotle jam, orange blossom honey, or French churned butter. \u201cIt becomes this fun show-and-tell thing where everyone\u2019s contributing to the table, thanking one another, and saying, \u2018OMG, what is this thing? I have to know more about it. I\u2019m gonna go out and buy it tomorrow,\u2019\u201d Lewin says. \u201cIt turns the dinner into a real conversation starter.\u201dEmbrace your random, mismatched dinnerwareThe thought of making a perfectly manicured, IG-worthy cheeseboard can feel intimidating. The portions! The placements! The symmetry! But it doesn\u2019t have to be complicated. Lewin advocates for using a hodgepodge of serving vessels and materials. \u201cWood and resin with different colors, textures, and styles can bring personality to each thing you\u2019re eating,\u201d she says. \u201cThe snack table wants that!\u201d On a purely aesthetic level, a unique vessel can go a long way in making anything look good\u2014even if it happens to be a plate of beige store-bought crackers. (If you\u2019re keen on a matching set, though, we\u2019ve got you covered too.)Practice on a Tuesday nightI can\u2019t think of one good reason to save your snack plate for a dinner party. Who doesn\u2019t want to chow on cheese and crackers in front of the TV on a weeknight? Plus, practice enough and snack-platter mastery will be second nature and stress-free when it comes time to host. \u201cCheese pairings tend to stress people out,\u201d Lewin says. \u201cI think that\u2019s because no one thinks about them until they\u2019re about to host 10 people.\u201d Then the panic sets in. What is Butterk\u00e4se cheese?! How do I know if it's gonna be good?! You can avoid the meltdown by treating yourself to different cheeses and new flavors regularly.Lewin finds her own inspiration via customers who come into Big Night and buy a bunch of different cheeses, crackers, jams, and honeys. \u201cI ask them if they have a big party coming up, and they\u2019re [often] like, \u2018No, I\u2019m just having this for dinner,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt becomes a zero-pressure situation when you\u2019re eating alone in your pajamas at your kitchen counter at 9 p.m.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titPartiesDinner PartiesCultureLifestyleRecipes you want to make.
