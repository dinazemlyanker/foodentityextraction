We checked in with activist Tania Maree Giordani, who has supplied protestors with thousands of kits through her Instagram @nourishnyc, about how she got started and her plans to grow with the movement.I\u2019ve always been deeply invested in activism. Growing up, I would joke that I didn\u2019t need to read Pedagogy of the Oppressed, I was living it: I was raised within that framework of thought and actions, which centers around how students can question and dismantle systems of oppression and domination. (That didn\u2019t stop me from poring over the book anyways!) I started attending workshops engaging with Paolo Freire\u2019s pedagogy at the Chicago Freedom School when I was six years old with my mother and older sister, and in high school I helped create workshops with my comrades at Theatre of the Oppressed Chicago to educate my community about the 2013 Chicago Public School closings.These experiences and Freire\u2019s pedagogy have always inspired me to stay dedicated to community work. During my second year of undergrad, in fall 2018, I helped plan a benefit concert for the American Indian Community House, and now I am a member of the colectiva that runs Mil Mundos bookstore in East Bushwick, which is devoted to amplifying Black, Latinx, and Indigenous voices.Because of how I was raised, I believe activism is a daily commitment. It\u2019s the intention behind your actions. It\u2019s thinking about who you\u2019re giving your money and your time to. It\u2019s following through on these intentions even, and especially, when it\u2019s not convenient.I was on the ground at a protest on May 28. I hadn\u2019t planned on being there, but it was happening at Union Square, right by where I was living at the time. A lot of people didn\u2019t have masks, and my own was full of sweat after 45 minutes. I was sharing my water with people\u2014I totally forgot that we are in the middle of a fucking pandemic. But people should protest. And people should be angry. So I was like, \u201cWhat can we do to make this safer?\u201d I couldn\u2019t find any organizations or people who were already distributing PPE, water, and snacks at the time, so I figured I could raise some funds to distribute these items at the protests I was attending.On May 29 I decided to organize through Instagram and Twitter. I had originally used my Instagram for my business as a makeup artist to share my artwork and to promote my new skin-care line, but I changed the handle to be something people would know how to spell, something easily recognizable that could be shouted and immediately understood. That\u2019s how \u201cNourishNYC\u201d was born: in my bed at 2 a.m.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.I didn\u2019t expect to raise more than $200 to $1000, but to date I\u2019ve raised over $120,000 and am hoping to pursue the process of formally becoming a nonprofit. Initially, I stored material donations in my living room, but the team at Babycastles (an art collective in downtown Manhattan) generously donated their space to use as a depot. At the depot, which is now primarily managed by Omari Wyands, we store all of our supplies and create safety kits. We have various types of kits, but the majority that we send out include one surgical or reusable mask, a pair of gloves, a travel-size hand sanitizer, Band-Aids, and a snack all inside of a sandwich-size ziplock bag. In addition to our safety kits, snacks, and beverages, we distribute grants to protestors and organizers and have committed $20,000 to the relaunch of the Cloud Room, our initiative that encourages the practice of imagining a radically different future through funding mental and physical wellness services and educational and arts programming for primarily Black and Indigenous LGTBQ+ folks.This is a really poignant moment in my life. Two weeks before founding NourishNYC I reached out to my class dean, who I speak with regularly. I told her how hurtful it was that there\u2019s no way for my college to be equitable because it wasn\u2019t built for people who look like me. I told her that I didn\u2019t know if I wanted to go back. I\u2019ve realized that, at 22, I\u2019m exactly who I want to be. I\u2019m doing everything that I want to commit my life to.One of my high school educators often assigned \u201csmile at the sun\u201d for homework. It was my work then; it is my work now. And it is my work to share that warmth with others as well. \u2014As told to Jesse Sparks and Sarah JampelSome other organizations to keep on your radar:Fuel The People, NYC & D.C.The John Walt Foundation, ChicagoThe Saint Supper Collective, NYC (I am the co-director of this organization)The Black Chef Movement, NYCExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishRead MoreLifestyleThe Herbal Mutual Aid Network Creates Free Tinctures for Black OrganizersBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
