Not only does it act as a tenderizer, but it also creates a crust on the meat and carries the flavor of the spices (here those are the shawarma heavy-hitters like cumin, coriander, and turmeric). The chicken marinates for just 30 minutes (or up to 12 hours in the fridge if you\u2019re not in a rush), which makes it exceedingly doable without tons of planning. Roasting the bird alongside halved shallots and sliced lemons means you get jammy and crispy accompanying bites built right in, cooked in the rich chicken juices.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Transfer spice mixture to a small bowl; whisk in garlic, yogurt, and 2 Tbsp. oil. Generously season chicken with salt, then smear yogurt mixture all over. Let sit on a rimmed baking sheet at room temperature at least 30 minutes, or chill, uncovered, up to 12 hours. If chilling, let chicken sit at room temperature 30 minutes before roasting.Step 2Preheat oven to 425\u00b0. Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Place chicken, breast side up, in pan, then nestle shallots, cut side down, and lemon slices around. Season shallots and lemon with salt. Tuck in oregano sprigs and cook, undisturbed, until shallots are starting to brown, about 3 minutes.Step 3Pour \u00bd cup water into pan; transfer skillet to oven, arranging so legs are pointing toward back of oven. Roast until skin has taken on some color, 10\u201315 minutes. Reduce heat to 325\u00b0; continue to roast until chicken is cooked through and tender (an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast should register 155\u00b0; it will climb to 165\u00b0 as the chicken rests) and shallots are jammy, 60\u201370 minutes. Let rest 15 minutes.Step 4Transfer chicken to a cutting board and carve as desired. Arrange on a platter; tuck shallots and lemon slices around. Spoon juices in pan over, top with oregano leaves, and sprinkle with sea salt.How would you rate Shawarma Roast Chicken With Shallots and Lemons?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (4)Back to TopTriangleSo easy and so good! I subbed drumsticks and had zero time to marinate, but the chicken still came out juicy and flavorful. I served it with a mezze platter consisting of spring veggies, hummus, baba ganoush and pita. Definitely recommend!StephanieCA3/23/2022Delicious! I used thighs and regular onions and this was an actually doable weeknight dinner with some roasted asparagus Starchaser Detroit MI3/22/2022Delicious, simple to prepare, and used  basic ingredients I tend to have on hand. I roasted broccoli and yellow squash while the chicken rested.
