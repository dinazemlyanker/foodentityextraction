Selecting the right tomatoes is the key: Opt for the firmest heirlooms you can find, which balance flavor with the right texture and help avoid a watery salsa. The finished pico de gallo is far better than store-bought\u2014use it to top our Tex-Mex enchiladas or spoon it over a layered queso. It\u2019s best used the day it\u2019s made, but will hold in an airtight container in the refrigerator for a day or two.If you\u2019re looking to experiment a bit more, remember that nearly any vegetable or fruit can be turned into a salsa, just follow this formula.Editor\u2019s note: This recipe was originally published on January 12, 2017.IngredientsMakes about 2 cups2large tomatoes, preferably heirloom, chopped\u00bconion, chopped2jalape\u00f1os, finely chopped1garlic clove, finely grated\u2153cup cilantro leaves with tender stems, finely chopped3tablespoons fresh lime juiceKosher saltPreparationGently toss tomatoes, onion, jalape\u00f1os, garlic, cilantro, and lime juice in a small bowl; season with salt.

I'd suggest 1-1/2 jalapenos and 1/2 serrano. Serranos are hotter, but they also add \"late heat\" whereas jalapenos are more \"early heat.\" Makes a wonderful combo. You can wait to add the peppers until the end, and then taste as you add a bit at a time so you get what you want in the way of heat.\n\nAlso, consider adding a tablespoon or so extra-virgin olive oil if you'd like to add that to the texture.  \n\nFinally, if you have a small salad spinner, chop the tomatoes first and give them a light bit of salt and set aside. Then finish the rest of your chopping. Now spin the tomatoes to pull some of the water and seeds out before adding them to the other ingredients.SteveHouston, TX9/2/2021Perfect.
