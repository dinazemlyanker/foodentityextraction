These get the \u201cloaded potato\u201d treatment with roasted chickpeas, broccoli, and crumbled feta finished with a drizzle of tangy yogurt sauce made with the signature flavor of Cholula\u00ae Original Hot Sauce for just enough heat.PrintIngredients4 medium sweet potatoes1 medium head broccoli1 15-ounce can chickpeas4 garlic cloves4 tablespoons olive oil, divided1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more1/2 cup whole milk Greek yogurt3 tablespoons Cholula\u00ae Original Hot Sauce, plus more6 ounces feta cheese, in brine, divided1 lemonRecipe PreparationPreheat oven to 425\u00b0 and place racks in the upper and lower thirds. Scrub sweet potatoes under running water and poke holes all over with the tip of a paring knife. Wrap each potato tightly in aluminum foil and bake on the upper rack until a knife pierced through the foil slides easily into center of potato, 60\u201375 minutes.While potatoes are baking, prep your vegetables:\nCut broccoli into \u00bd\u201d florets and transfer to a large rimmed baking sheet (reserve stem for snacking or another use).Drain can of chickpeas into a strainer, rinse under cold water, then shake to remove excess water. Pat dry with paper towels and transfer to sheet tray with broccoli.Smash garlic on cutting board with the flat side of a knife and remove skins. Add to baking sheet.Drizzle broccoli mixture with 3 Tbsp. olive oil and sprinkle with kosher salt. Toss with clean hands to coat, then spread out in an even layer on baking sheet.Roast on lower rack along with sweet potatoes, shaking baking sheet once or twice, until chickpeas are golden and crisp and broccoli is browned, 20\u201325 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool.Combine yogurt, 3 Tbsp. Cholula Original, half of feta cheese, remaining 1 Tbsp. olive oil, and the roasted garlic from the baking sheet in the jar of a hand blender. Season with salt. [NOTE: This amount of Cholula will give the yogurt sauce a reddish tint.] Cut lemon into 6 wedges, remove seeds, and squeeze 2 wedges into jar with yogurt mixture. Blend until mixture is completely smooth; set aside.When sweet potatoes are tender, remove from oven and let cool slightly, then unwrap foil and discard (watch for hot liquid and steam inside foil). Make long, shallow, lengthwise cuts into tops of each potato. Squeeze sides slightly and press down to expose orange flesh. Let potatoes sit for a few minutes to allow steam to escape.Season potatoes with more salt, then dollop yogurt mixture over flesh.Squeeze two more lemon wedges over broccoli mixture, then spoon mixture over top of potatoes.Crumble remaining feta over broccoli and top with a few more shakes of Cholula Original. Serve with remaining lemon wedges.Recipe by Cholula\u00ae Hot SauceRelated VideoWe\u2019ve Loaded Up These Sweet Potatoes with Some of Your Favorite FlavorsReviews SectionReviewsWrite a review\u2026GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for the Bon App\u00e9titNewsletterSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyExplore Bon App\u00e9titSponsoredBasicallyMore from Bon App\u00e9titRecipes6 Pro Chefs Reveal Their \"Secret Weapon\" Ingredients2022-03-02T17:00:00.000ZrecipePorcini Gnocchi With Butter Sauce2022-03-15T09:00:00.000ZrecipeWhiskey Sour2020-12-16T18:20:00.000ZBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
