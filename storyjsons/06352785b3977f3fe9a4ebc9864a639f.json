But the magical thing about natural wine hero Dana Frank\u2019s takeaway shop-cum-bar is that you can\u2019t not sit at the bar when you\u2019re checking out. Which also means you can\u2019t not see the list of 30-plus wines by the glass on offer. Which, of course, also means, well, whaddya know, you do have time for a splash (or two, or three) of that Loire pet-nat that you weren\u2019t initially planning on buying a bottle of\u2014but, of course, you are now.Frank won\u2019t steer you wrong. She stocks what she hails as \u201cthe grand-daddy of dry riesling in the Rheingau\u201d: 2014 JB Becker Riesling Trocken Wallufer. \u201cI absolutely love the unequivocal German-ness of Ha-Jo Becker\u2019s wines and the fact that he was one of the very first to make naturally farmed dry rieslings that fly in the face of tradition,\u201d she told me. Then there\u2019s the 2017 Complemen Terre Muscadet Croix Moriceau. \u201cIt\u2019s from the \u2018new school\u2019 of Muscadet, where the wines see a little bit of malolactic fermentation,\u201d she explained. \u201cThat gives them an exquisite texture and body. Like sucking on a stone covered in lemon curd. So good!\u201d Now that\u2019s my kind of shopping.Go there: Bar NormanExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendWine BarsPortland OregonRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
