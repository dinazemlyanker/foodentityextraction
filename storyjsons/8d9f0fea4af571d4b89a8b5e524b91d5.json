To find out the ideal vessels for storing every imaginable type of food, we sought out the wise advice of our test kitchen editors past and present, a group of people who know their way around leftover sauces, stews, and grains. Below are their favorite containers for repackaging food to keep it fresher, longer.Real footage of your kitchen, before reading our advice.\nFor meat, fish, and pasta: glass containersTypical weeknight dinner situation: You made too much pasta with red sauce (on purpose) and you\u2019re meting out the leftovers for tomorrow\u2019s lunch. Skip the plastic containers and go with glass ones. You need a nonporous material that won\u2019t turn a faint shade of red post-tomato sauce and an airtight seal so nothing leaks. Former senior food editor Anna Stockwell recommends the Oxo Good Grips Smart Seal glass food storage set because of its tight locking lids and silicone gaskets: \u201cThey seal really well, are freezer-safe, and easy to clean. Plus, they're made of oven-safe borosilicate glass,\u201d which makes reheating leftover lasagna that much easier. Food director Chris Morocco is also team glass \u201cfor frankly any food,\u201d but he\u2019s loyal to GlassLock containers which come in a range of sizes and have strong snap-on latches.OXO Good Grips Smart Seal Glass Food Storage Container Set$33 at Amazon (Set of 4)$68 at Amazon (Set of 8)Glasslock Oven Safe Container Set$52 at Amazon (Set of 9)For freezing soups and stocks: plastic deli containersIn our humble opinion, some of the best food storage containers with lids\u2014or at least the best plastic ones\u2014are practically free. \u201cI use deli containers recycled from Indian food delivery, pickles from Russ & Daughters, and leftovers from the test kitchen,\u201d says former food director Carla Lalli Music. They\u2019re cheap, reliable, and standard in many restaurant kitchens for good reason. They're stackable and, best of all, the same lid fits quart, pint, and half-pint containers alike. If you don\u2019t order enough takeout to accumulate a proper stash, a set of 44 containers will run you $24.DuraHome Food Storage Containers with Lids$32 $23 at Amazon (Set of 44)Although whether plastic containers are microwave and dishwasher safe is a matter of debate (we recommend hand-washing, but if you're going to toss them into the dishwasher, at least use the top rack), we love them for freezing; the quart size is perfect for storing big batches of stock in portions that are convenient for most recipes. We like to label ours with the contents and date using masking tape and a Sharpie.\u00a0For maximizing refrigerator space: square deli containersOur test kitchen staff may be hopelessly devoted to standard deli containers for their convenience, price, and stacking capabilities, but there\u2019s one thing we can\u2019t ignore: Their cylindrical shape wastes a lot of space on refrigerator shelves. Square plastic food storage containers, on the other hand, can be packed into fridges, freezers, and pantries in a more snug fashion. It\u2019s simple geometry! Senior editor Sarah Jampel loves these space-saving, BPA-free plastic square containers with leakproof lids. \u201cThey have all the benefits of cylindrical deli containers\u2014lightweight, affordable but not disposable\u2014and they also nestle into my shelves like puzzle pieces,\u201d she says. They come in sets of 20, which makes them amazing meal prep containers.Photo by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Pearl Jones16-oz. Square Clear Deli Containers with Lids (Set of 20)$25 at AmazonFor dressings, grains, and sauces: glass jarsA food storage container set that doubles as a set of drinking glasses? Count us in. \u201cI have a jar hoarding problem and save most coconut oil/ghee/peanut butter/jam jars for storing salad dressings and uncooked rice,\u201d says Lalli Music. Wide-mouth canisters are great for grains while smaller half-cup containers will do just fine for sauces and dressings.Ball Wide Mouth Mason Jars, 16 oz$40 at Amazon (set of 12)Ball Regular Mouth Mason Jars, 4 oz$23 at Amazon (Set of 8)\u00a0Stockwell replaces the two-part canning lid on Mason jars with these plastic tops, which are easier to clean and make it less likely that your vinaigrette will leak all over your lunch box.Ball Leakproof Mason Jar Lids$11 at AmazonFor sandwiches, snacks, and doughs: reusable food storage bagsThese eco-friendly Zip Top bags helped Jampel kick her longtime habit of cleaning, drying, and reusing plastic zipper storage bags. Made with a thick-but-flexible silicone and equipped with flat bottoms, Zip Top bags are durable, leakproof, and can stand upright without flopping over. Use them for anything you\u2019d typically use a plastic bag for: freezing fruits and veggies, decanting almost-empty pasta boxes, or even holding liquids.Photo by Emma FishmanReusable Zip Top Storage Bags (Set of 3)$48 at Amazon$48 at HiveRecipe production assistant Mehreen Karim is a fan of these reusable Stasher bags, which have a super tight seal. She uses them for everything from packing sandwiches to saving cookie dough. Both Zip Top and Stasher bags come in a variety of sizes and are dishwasher-safe, microwave-safe, freezer-safe\u2014but most importantly, they make great sustainable alternatives to single-use plastic bags.Photo by Emma FishmanStasher Bags$55 at Amazon (set of 4 small)$22 $15 at Amazon (half-gallon)For bulk storage: large plastic airtight containersAn extreme baking hobby becomes a lot more convenient when you\u2019ve got an 8-quart Cambro container full of flour on deck. Senior staff writer Alex Beggs keeps one on her countertop for her 10-pound bag of King Arthur's all-purpose flour\u2014and since they come in a number of different sizes, she stacks a 6-quart Cambro filled with granulated sugar right on top.\u00a08-Quart Cambro Square Food Storage Container With Lid$31 $30 at AmazonThese containers also work wonders for storing bulk portions of other dry goods like lentils, beans, and grains. If you\u2019re one to buy 20\u201325-pound bags of rice, Beggs recommends this 13.21-quart Tellfresh airtight container, which has a hefty handle.13.21-Quart Tellfresh Large Airtight Superstorer$28 at Container StoreFor cooking oils: plastic squeeze bottlesStocking up on a giant tin of Frantoia olive oil is a great investment, but it\u2019s almost impossible to pour a tablespoon straight from its container. You could transfer the oil to a fancy cruet, but a humble squeeze bottle is your best bet for everyday cooking. The flexible plastic is clear, which could potentially make the olive oil go rancid more quickly, but if you\u2019re cooking with olive oil a couple times a day you\u2019ll go through the bottle faster than you think.16 Oz.
