The Guardians of the Galaxy star and her husband, Marco Perego, capitalize on time when their three kids are sleeping to conduct \u201cfun experiments\u201d with alternative grains, including quinoa, almond, and rice flour, and starches like potato and tapioca. \u201cMy mission is to make a fluffy, delicious gluten-free bread. I take great pleasure in doing that,\u201d the actress said at the launch of the American Express Cash Magnet Card, citing \"very dense\" rice flour as her least favorite and tapioca starch as her favorite binder.All of this late-night bread tinkering has taught her a few tricks, like adding half an avocado to soften up the bread or sprinkling in caramelized onions when she\u2019s leaning toward a more savory loaf. Bread is one of her greatest joys, but to manage her Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune disease that affects her thyroid, she sticks to a gluten-free and mostly dairy-free diet, and her whole family is about 80 percent plant-based. So rather than a slathering of butter on warm bread, she\u2019ll drizzle on organic honey or make a tapenade of sun-dried tomatoes, olives, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar.Zoe Saldana bakes loaves like this super-seedy, gluten-free bread.\nAlex LauBreadmaking isn\u2019t Saldana\u2019s only adventure in cooking. \u201cWhenever I have the chance, I make my own almond milk. I started making it because I was sick of what was in stores,\u201d she explained. \u201cMaking my own gives me the ability to add any probiotics or flavoring like vanilla beans. It has a very short shelf life, so you have to drink it within two days, but it\u2019s super nutritious.\u201dAnd those probiotics? They\u2019re often home-grown too, thanks to coconut yogurt. Her process is relatively simple: \u201cI crack open a coconut, blend up the meat in the food processor to whatever texture I want, or none, add probiotics, and leave it out for 24\u201336 hours. I ferment it for as long as I want to according to how strong I want the taste to be, then I refrigerate it. I like it tangy, but not too tangy, usually with a little organic honey, vanilla, or cinnamon. I make it so rich in probiotics that I just have one spoonful a day and it sets me up for the rest of the day. I\u2019ll add the coconut water to make sippable kefir too.\u201dSaldana lives a pretty healthy lifestyle, but she doesn\u2019t limit herself too much. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in a no-carb lifestyle, clearly,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cI balance out all my food groups and know they\u2019re gonna give me all the energy that I need. And I\u2018ll always make room for fresh-baked bread with honey.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titCelebritiesHealthyishGluten FreeRead MoreLifestyleThis Gluten-Free Carrot Cake Made BA Staffers Pretty Much Lose Our MindsBy Amanda ShapirocookingWhy Some Gluten-Sensitive People Can Still Eat Sourdough BreadBy Keri Wigintonrecipes59 Gluten-Free Desserts That Won't Give You Flour FOMOGallery59 SlidesBy Bon App\u00e9titcooking77 Gluten-Free Recipes You Definitely Want to CookGallery77 SlidesBy The Healthyish TeamRecipes you want to make.
