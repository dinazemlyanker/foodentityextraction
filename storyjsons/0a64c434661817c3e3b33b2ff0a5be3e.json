They\u2019re perfect because they take on an impossibly crispy coating on the outside while remaining steamy-creamy and light inside.Whatever you choose to call them, not enough Americans are cooking their potatoes this way. And Chris, whose wife is from Somerset, England, (and makes her potatoes by heart, something we should all aspire to) knew he needed to bring them to BA. What better occasion to do so than Thanksgiving? After all, the same thing that makes them ideal during a roast (you know, the fluffy insides for soaking everything up) makes them a perfect pairing for gravy. \u201cThere's something about that rich, smooth gravy on top of a crispy potato\u2014you'll see.\u201d They immediately became the entire staff\u2019s favorite Thanksgiving issue recipe. \u201cGOLDEN NUGGETS!\u201d was the internal office nickname.To get \u2018em right, it\u2019s all about technique, which has three parts. Let\u2019s talk about them.1. Par-Boil the TatersFor around 10 minutes. This gives the potatoes a head start in the cooking process and means we\u2019ll get a delightfully light and fluffy interior later.2. Rough Them UpAfter you drain the water, you toss the potatoes about to \u201crough them up,\u201d aka rubbing starch all over the exterior. That starch will be like flour in the oven, and when it soaks up the oil, it\u2019ll create that thick, crispy coating with a \u201cpronounced crunch,\u201d as Chris puts it.Photo by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen Kaminski3. Saut\u00e9 Them\u2026in the OvenIn a roasting pan, you combine olive oil (or something extravagant like duck fat!!), which adds flavor, and vegetable oil, which lowers the olive oil\u2019s smoke point, and heat it in the oven for 10 minutes. A HOT oven, people. 425\u00b0. Some commenters noticed that their potatoes weren\u2019t browning, which means their ovens needed a crank up. Ovens can be tricksters, running higher or lower than what we set them to, a good case for an oven thermometer\u2014or use your instincts and keep a close eye to adjust accordingly. (You can also use the convection mode on your oven, if you have it, which will circulate the heat more and cook them faster.)The roughed-up potatoes go into the hot oil, get tossed to coat (CRISPY SECRETS, REVEALED!), and then roast for around 40 minutes. During that time, keep tossing continuously, every 10 minutes. If it feels like you\u2019re saut\u00e9ing and you\u2019re wondering why we\u2019re even doing this in the oven, well, let me tell you: browning the potatoes slowly in the oven lets their flavor develop, the oven also allows you to roast a TON of potatoes and get an even, steamy heat that results in that light, creamy interior. (See also: Basically\u2019s crispy roast potatoes). Doing this on the stove would also be a splattering mess.In the final 10 minutes of roasting, Chris adds in garlic and rosemary to flavor the potatoes even more\u2014it\u2019s Thanksgiving, after all. Then serve and eat them right away. Unlike many of our other recipes for the holiday this year, this is not a make-ahead recipe, and the French Fry Law very much applies: A cold fry is never preferable to a hot-out-of-the-oil one. So plan accordingly.Get the recipe:Burnished Potato NuggetsBehold, your new standard for roasted potatoes: puck-size oven fries with creamy insides and unimaginably crunchy exteriors.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titThanksgivingPotatoEnglishRecipes you want to make.
