Have a question? Email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.At what age does one officially graduate from the kids\u2019 table (asking for a, um, 31-year-old friend)? \u2014Elderly ElaineThe kids\u2019 table is way more fun, and the conversation way more stimulating, than what\u2019s going down at the adult table, which is an encyclopedic run-down of cousin Arnold\u2019s last five podiatrist appointments. But I get it: You want some respect. Did you help prepare a dish, do Cinderella-level floor cleaning, or otherwise contribute labor to the dinner? Do you file your own taxes? ONLY THEN do you get permission to dine among the elders. Also, if there are enough chairs.Illustration by Cari Vander YachtMy well-meaning sibling insists on baking elaborate, Mary-Berry-Great-British-Baking-Show schlock every year. How do I politely decline? \u2014Harold the HaterI don\u2019t think the Mary Berry jab is necessary, but you have a common conundrum: guests who show up with random dishes that throw off your entire Thanksgiving tableau. When you send out the invites and the Google-doc-that-isn\u2019t-Excel-but-is-Excel of contributions, make a locked column of specific dishes (e.g., Green Bean casserole, Cranberry Sauce, Seven-Layer Dip), and have people sign up to bring those. If someone asks if they can construct a 17-pound pumpkin-spice trifle, say, \u201cThat sounds lovely, but to maintain order in the universe, please consult the spreadsheet.\u201dWe do Thanksgiving potluck-style, but I don\u2019t have time to cook anything. What can I bring (besides wine) to show that I am trying? \u2014 At-Least-She-Tried AdrianaHow about:Compostable platesScratch-off Lotto ticketsIcePepto-BismolBounty select-a-size paper towelsThat book you borrowed from me in 2012GrandmaGlad Lock deep dish storage containers for leftoversIllustration by Cari Vander YachtIs it ever okay to just...not help clean up? \u2014Bitter BettyPeople DISAPPEAR when it\u2019s time to clear the table, yet at no other time are they more exposed. We see you \u201cGoing to check on the baby/the game/Grandma.\u201d If you didn\u2019t bring something, or you\u2019re a kid, you\u2019re doin\u2019 dishes! Relish the soapy solitude.SNACK BREAKThis Thanksgiving, consider shrimp cocktail! Here\u2019s how to make it like your favorite steakhouse does.BA\u2019s Best Shrimp CocktailShrimp cocktail is all about the shrimp: big, fat, perfectly cooked gorgeous shrimp. Here\u2019s how to do it.View RecipeHow do you go about telling your friend who drinks too much that he might want to consider not drinking too much this year? \u2014Good Luck, GaryThere\u2019s too much nuance in this scenario\u2014your relationship with this person, how bad the drinking is\u2014for me to solve this complicated problem in one paragraph. (I\u2019m also not a trained therapist!!!) But I\u2019ve been saying this (loudly) at the start of meals: \u201cGuys, I\u2019ve discovered this new technique that people have been writing about in magazines for years! After every glass of wine, I chug a glass of water. And it works! I am vowing, in the presence of this turkey, not to get drunk at Thanksgiving.\u201d Perhaps others will follow.Illustration by Cari Vander YachtWhat should I do if my mother-in-law and I are in disagreement about what temperature the turkey should be cooked to? \u2014Freakout FeliciaThere are a lot of moments on Thanksgiving where you need to accept that you are powerless to the dubious decisions of others, and this is one. (Eating dinner at 4 p.m. is another.)When it\u2019s your turn to \u201cgive thanks,\u201d is it wrong to say, \u201cI\u2019m thankful Thanksgiving is only once a year\u201d?  \u2014Grateful GillianIt\u2019s certainly not wrong\u2026but does that make it right? Here are some ideas for things to be grateful for this year:Claire SaffitzYour healthLizzoThe Co-Star appThose straws made from hayMortadellaMy uncle\u2019s new girlfriend picked the crispy skin off the turkey as we carved it while saying, \u201cThe skin is the best part.\u201d Discuss. \u2014Gossipy GailYou have some hostility toward this interloper, huh? If it were your goofy cousin Kyle instead would this be such a big deal? It\u2019s Thanksgiving! Open your heart and your home. The golden brown crispy skin IS the best part. I always sneak a sample for quality control. At the very least you\u2019ve gotta respect You\u2019re Not My Real Aunt\u2019s survivalist instincts. If she didn\u2019t grab it now, who knows if her serving would have any skin on it?! (It wouldn\u2019t, because she ate it all.)That\u2019s all for now, but if you have petty etiquette questions, recipe requests, or just want to tell me you think I\u2019m unfunny and WRONG, so wrong, about everything, please email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.Love, AlexExplore Bon App\u00e9titIs It Ever OkayEtiquetteThanksgivingRead Morecooking10 Tips To Help You Win ThanksgivingBy Adam RapoportrecipesBon App\u00e9tit\u2019s Absolutely, Positively Perfect Thanksgiving MenuGallery8 SlidesBy The Bon App\u00e9tit Test KitchenRecipes you want to make.
