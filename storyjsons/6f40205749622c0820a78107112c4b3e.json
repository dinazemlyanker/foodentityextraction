Unless I\u2019m cooking on a leisurely Sunday afternoon, I ask myself this question whenever I contemplate trying a new recipe, whether it\u2019s from Bon App\u00e9tit, Epicurious, a new cookbook, or a blog. Nothing is as exciting as the moment of discovery, be it of a new ingredient, an unexpected flavor combination, or a hitherto untried technique. At the same time, when charting new territory, I can\u2019t help but worry it will be a bust. What if I love it but the family doesn\u2019t and I have to make a second dish? What if it\u2019s a lot of work for little payoff? At one point in my life I might have had the patience for a few misses. But between attending back-to-back meetings and finding a minute to decompress, all I want are the hits.So here in this monthly column, I will dig through the archives of Epicurious and Bon App\u00e9tit to find those meals where the payoff is greater than the effort, meals that are easy to prepare, require little more than what\u2019s in your pantry, and leave you enough time to rewatch Bridgerton, learn a new language, read a novel, or catch up with friends via social media. Meals that will convince you that you do have both the bandwidth and the time to try something new. One recommendation a month. Simple, delicious, accessible.For my first recipe, I had to go with one of my faves\u2014Roast Fish with Cannellini Beans and Green Olives. You can whip it up quickly, and you should have all but the fish in your pantry (if not, you can get what ingredients up you don\u2019t have at most grocery stores). It\u2019s incredibly rewarding to get so much flavor with so little effort.Some people are intimidated by fish. But I\u2019m enchanted by its generosity. It\u2019s a protein that often wears its feelings on its gills. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s ready by virtue of its sheen and touch. Of course, the recipe will provide guidance as well.With the green olives and red chiles (for eye candy, not really heat) offsetting the white of the fish and the beans, this is a stunner. It comes together in no time if you use canned beans, though I love to make my own. I soak dried beans overnight, then throw them in the pot with saut\u00e9ed onions and whatever aromatics are in the fridge\u2014usually fresh rosemary or thyme\u2014salt, and a broth made from the carcass of Sunday\u2019s roast chicken. Claire Saffitz, who developed this recipe, says you can use butter beans or chickpeas and any whitefish, but I am sticking with cannellini beans and cod. For extra beauty and bitterness, throw in some radicchio. You\u2019ve got time for this.Roast Fish with Cannellini Beans and Green OlivesThis is one of those throw-together dinner recipes that relies on staples like canned beans and lemons; all you have to do is pick up the fish.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titYou\u2019ve Got Time for ThisRecipes you want to make.
