If I can translate it for my brand, I can translate it for other people too, and give them the leg up that I\u2019ve been given.\u201dWe asked Javeri Kadri to tell us about six women whose businesses she\u2019s hyping right now. These were her answers:Spandana Gopal, Tiipoi Design Studio: \u201cShe collaborates with craftspeople to create manufactured products, and her Karipot, made with Longi black pottery by an artisan from Manipur, is a beautiful example. Cooking with it has been my favorite part of the pandemic.\u201dEkom Kaur Mamik, Moringa What: \u201cEspecially in the U.S., Moringa has been co-opted so that it\u2019s divorced from its origins. Ekom works with smallholder producers across south India [and West Bengal], highlighting different varieties of Moringa and how they\u2019re traditionally used in India. She sells a Moringa face mask as well as pure Moringa for consumption.\u201dZeinorin Stephen, Hill Wild: \u201cWhat she\u2019s able to do for the farming community of Manipur amazes me. Not only does she run Hill Wild, her chocolate business that uses ingredients indigenous to the hills of Ukhrul, like perilla seeds and ghost peppers, but she also manages sourcing for Diaspora and is constantly acting as a food hub for producers in the region. Recently there was a surplus of kiwi, so she turned it into kiwi candy.\u201dSonoko Sakai, Sonoko Curry Powder: \u201cA lot of people use the term curry powder without questioning whether it\u2019s Japanese curry powder or Madras curry powder, for example. Sonoko is really bringing the Japanese history of curry powder into her product and making it specific.\u201dEvangelia Koutsovoulou, Daphnis and Chloe: \u201cWhen I was starting Diaspora, she was a real inspiration to me. She\u2019s doing for Greek and Mediterranean herbs and spices what we\u2019re doing for Indian spices. And I\u2019m obsessed with her products. I buy them constantly. Her smoked chile flakes are unreasonably delicious. Same with her fennel. I don\u2019t think Diaspora will ever be able to source more delicious fennel than that.\u201dJing Gao, Fly by Jing: \u201cI really relate to Jing\u2019s story of returning to her roots, diving deep into Sichuan flavors, and sticking to her guns. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve struggled with so much\u2014I\u2019ve been tempted to water down the mission, the flavors, and the point of Diaspora at many turns if it meant we would sell better or be more popular. Jing has only dug her feet in deeper, and I admire that so much.\u201dRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
