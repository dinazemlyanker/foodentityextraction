It can be found at Japanese markets, in the Asian foods section of some supermarkets, and online.PreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 350\u00b0. Toast pistachios on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing halfway through, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Let cool; set aside.Step 2Meanwhile, bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Boil scallions, peppers, and carrot tops until peppers are tender, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a bowl of ice water and let cool. Drain and squeeze out as much excess water with your hands as possible. Transfer to a plate and chill in freezer 5 minutes (this will keep the dip bright green).Step 3Finely grind nori in a blender; transfer to a small bowl. Wipe out blender, then blend vinegar, soy sauce, and reserved nuts in blender until nuts are coarsely chopped. Add chilled vegetable mixture along with tofu and blend, streaming in oil, until very smooth (this may take up to 4 minutes, depending on your blender). If mixture seems thick, add 1 Tbsp. water to loosen.Step 4Transfer dip to a bowl and sprinkle with nori powder. Serve with vegetables alongside for dipping.How would you rate Shishito Pepper\u2013Pistachio Dip?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (3)Back to TopTriangleI can't believe there are only 2 reviews of this dip. It is SO good! I used parsley instead of carrot tops. I grow shishitos and have a good crop of them currently. The flavor is mild, not spicy and the texture is so creamy and luscious.Natalie MatzOmaha, Ne7/17/2021Absolutely outstanding. Gorgeous dish to serve to the family Jane doe Boston MA4/7/2021Quite delicious. The soy and pistachios provide a good strong umami flavor backdrop. While the carrot tops are an interesting idea and provide nice flavor, the practicality is that they also add a stringy fibery texture...unless you want to remove ALL the stem pieces from the carrot top leaves.. I would go with parsley in the futureacookfromdetroit10/1/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titDipPistachioNutShishito PepperVegetableTofuOther IngredientsSnackStarterVeganVegetarianDairy-FreeHealthyishDinnerRecipes you want to make.
