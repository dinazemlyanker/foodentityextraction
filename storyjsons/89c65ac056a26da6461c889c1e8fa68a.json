Then dive deeper into the wonderful world of Spanish small plates: txitxiki, teensy sandwiches, crisped on the outside and stuffed with homemade chorizo hash; white asparagus scattered with chopped egg and a truffle vinaigrette; txipiron \u201cencebollado,\u201d luxurious ribbons of squid tossed in pine nuts and a sweet onion-y sauce; and txarripatak, wobbly trotters and tripe stewed with chickpeas and aromatic choricero peppers.THE VIBE IS: relatively chill. Located around the corner from a huge apartment complex and an elementary school, it\u2019s a lively little space in a quiet part of Chelsea. Families in the neighborhood bring their kids for dinner; friends stop for a quick drink and snack at the bar before they\u2019re onto the next stop of the night.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open for dinner every day: Monday to Thursday, from 5:30 to 11 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, from 5:30 to 11:30 p.m.; and Sunday, from 5:30 to 10:30 p.m. Reservations can be made through OpenTable or by phone for parties larger than 10.\u2014Elyse InamineMiguel HerreraWE ALSO LOVET\u00e9 CompanyA tearoom with a one-of-a-kind tasting menuLe CoucouA fine French meal that turns any night into a special occasionKeens SteakhouseNYC\u2019s classic midtown steakhouse\u2014still perfect after all these yearsExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
