With this new freedom, I\u2019ve been leaning into messy toasts, piled high with soft-scrambled eggs, roasted broccoli, and just about anything else that calls to me from my fridge.Without any technology to spill on or spectators watching, I can let crumbly cheese fall to the table. I don\u2019t care if half my showering of herbs ends up on the floor. I\u2019m delighted to pick up a piece of grilled bread and have the olive oil stick to my fingers because, hey, there\u2019s the sink where I can wash it off.The other day I assembled this Ni\u00e7oise Toast, so delicious and so precarious, loaded with far too many toppings to eat in a tidy manner. Another afternoon, I updated my go-to soft scramble with this version; the ricotta oozed double-time for my sloppy-eating pleasure. Speaking of ricotta, the creamy cheese makes the perfect base for any leftover vegetables from the night before, like seared mushrooms, steamed squash, or slow-cooked tomatoes (yes, this method will turn even height-of-winter tomatoes into something worth savoring). Smashed chickpeas and kimchi mixed into cream cheese both make great messy toasts when I have little else on hand.This brand-new recipe for a broccoli melt was my most recent messy victory. When I bit into it, the crusty baguette shattered, the mayo-chili sauce (a perfect condiment) dripped down my chin, and the piled-high florets of broccoli couldn\u2019t be contained underneath their blanket of melted cheddar. Deeply satisfying and perfectly unkempt, I will certainly make it again.When lunch is over (and my kitchen wiped down), I\u2019m full and ready for my next Zoom. As long as I remember to wipe that bit of egg off my face.Get the Recipe:Broccoli MeltsJust when we were starting to run out of ideas for what to make for lunch at home, these melty broccoli toasts appeared.View RecipeRead Morecooking55 Healthy Lunch Recipes and Only Some Are SaladGallery55 SlidesBy Anya TchoupakovRecipes you want to make.
