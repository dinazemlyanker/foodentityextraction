Well there\u2019s also a difference between \u201crustic\u201d and \u201ccrude.\u201d Maybe you\u2019d be able to guess where my galettes usually fit in? Always slightly misshapen and bulged, they\u2019re the same shape a three-year-old might draw when attempting a circle.But there\u2019s an easy trick for making galettes that look neat and tidy (though still easy-going and low-key, of course), no matter how amoeba-like your dough appeared when you first rolled it out. And that\u2019s simply to make slits along the border at even intervals before you start folding. Pile your filling into the middle, then use a knife to slice from the border of the dough to the border of the filling. (Make sure you\u2019re working on a sheet of parchment paper at this point so that you can easily transfer the shaped galette to the baking sheet.)It doesn\u2019t matter whether the slices are straight or slanted\u2014when you fold each one in, they\u2019ll overlap neatly, creating a shingled effect. The result is an even, uniform crust with no gaps or tears. You\u2019ve essentially just crimped your galette, which, in my book, is the treatment it deserves.And no one will mistake your galette for a three-year-old\u2019s.Get the recipe:Triple-Threat Onion GaletteNot just a clever name, this savory tart combines three alliums (scallions, garlic, and onion) for maximum flavor and crispy-jammy texture. The key to the flaky crust is to move fast! Rolling and folding the dough while the butter is still cold creates distinct layers of butter and flour that will steam apart during baking, making the crust light and flaky.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasically BakingRecipes you want to make.
