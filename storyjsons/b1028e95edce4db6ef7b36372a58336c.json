There\u2019s an impressive 50 taps of both local and imported craft beers at Alibi Room, and they all have your name on them.ORDER: something from local breweries Four Winds or Brassneck, the latter of which is run by Alibi\u2019s owner, Nigel Springthorpe. Get a burger or the jalape\u00f1o chicken \u201csamwich\u201d with fries, if you start to feel hangry.THE VIBE IS: laid-back and friendly, with life buddies, work buddies, and plenty of flannel. You\u2019ll overhear deep conversations about everything, from new video games to upcoming canoe trips. Despite its large industrial-heritage digs, Alibi Room is still crowded most nights, so you might have to wait a few minutes outside on Alexander Street before ordering your first brew.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day: Monday to Thursday, from 5 p.m. to 11:30 p.m.; Friday, from 5 p.m. to 12:30 a.m.; Saturday, from 10 a.m. to 12:30 a.m. (brunch from 10 a.m. to 2:45 p.m.); and Sunday, from 10 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. (brunch from 10 a.m. to 2:45 p.m.). Reservations are occasionally taken, but there are a lot of rules. We prefer to just walk in.\u2014Lindsay AndersonGrant HarderGrant HarderWE ALSO LOVEThe DiamondProhibition-era glam (and meticulously made cocktails) in GastownExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
