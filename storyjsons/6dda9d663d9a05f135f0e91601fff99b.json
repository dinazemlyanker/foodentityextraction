GreenleeFebruary 14, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Grace LeeFacebookTwitterEmailGrandma Daniels did not believe in that dusty, sexist adage about the stomach being the expressway to a man\u2019s affections. She wasn\u2019t concerned with the male appetite. And it showed in her one unbreakable rule of courtship.Sitting at her linoleum-top table, she laid down the law to me as I ate another piece of her seven-layer chocolate cake. She slowly peeled an orange\u2014her answer to an apple a day\u2014and patted her mouth daintily with a napkin.\u201cWhen you go to a man\u2019s house to meet his family for the first time, if they don\u2019t give you two pieces of meat, you get up and leave,\u201d she said firmly. She punctuated with pursed lips and a nod, her gray hair bun dipping in affirmation to her own statement.If only one piece of meat was offered, say, a measly chicken wing, I was to decamp immediately and remove that man from the romantic running. Gizzards or neckbone absolutely didn\u2019t count, even if you loved those pieces; it needed to be two pieces good enough to serve to the pastor on Sunday. And Grandma Daniels, raised though she was in a poor remote South Carolina town, coveted lobster and a juicy morsel of duck.She had earned those prime pieces. My grandmother was the \u201cmother\u201d of the family\u2019s African-Methodist Episcopal church just down the road, a position that required decades of diplomacy over potluck fundraisers and Sunday school disputes. She schooled me in the subtle arts of Southern etiquette, how to \u201cbe Jesus\u201d to other people, including eating someone\u2019s inedible food with nary a complaint.So to hear this no-negotiation dating tip from my calm, reasonable grandmother, whom local lore said never uttered a cuss word in her 96 years on earth, was surprising. In my mind, I wondered if her proclamation was a geriatric slip of the tongue or the hubris of the elderly, who say what they want because they\u2019ve outlived almost everyone else. This was not the Southern etiquette I knew.Born in 1917 in northeast South Carolina, Grandma Daniels was born into a rural African-American family that had only two children, she and a brother. As the beloved daughter in a small household, she never wanted for attention. Or meat. When she was a young girl, Grandma used to do Sunday visits\u2014sometimes church business, sometimes courting\u2014with her preacher father. If there was a meat problem, she\u2019d give him the signal. He would go outside and hitch the horse and buggy.Grandma Daniels\u2019 \u201ctwo pieces of meat\u201d rule was a pragmatic reflection of her rural farm upbringing where scarcity and hunger could be one week of scorching sun or rain away. After all, one didn\u2019t want to marry into a family that couldn't feed itself anymore than one wanted to marry into a family that wouldn\u2019t extend the kind of hospitality that allowed guests to eat their fill.Marriage was not just a happy union; it was a merging of families and futures. And she didn\u2019t want any woman (and her children) who had gone hungry to stay hungry, or any woman who had had ample food to lose it. A full larder\u2014in her mind, a smokehouse, fields of produce, grapevines, cows for milk, chickens and hogs\u2014was a prerequisite for the marital contract. To this day, my mother says with pride, \u201cWe never lacked for meat.\u201dBut first and foremost, whether baking her Saltine-crust macaroni and cheese or her collards with that hunk of hamhock, food was Grandma\u2019s love language. My grandmother was a housewife, seamstress extraordinaire, mother to six and aunt to many, and the administrator of our family farm. She kept the books, soothed children, and cooked huge breakfasts\u2014often filling literal metal buckets with fried chicken\u2014for the laborers who tended the tobacco, corn, and wheat. That tall chocolate cake was always waiting for me, when I arrived to visit. And there would be a Titanic-size slice wrapped in aluminum foil when I left to go home.I felt Grandma\u2019s position acutely when I got engaged. I should have employed her romance litmus test myself. My prospective mother-in-law barely offered me a glass of room-temperature water whenever I entered her home. I was low on the totem pole. I told myself that she was trying to make me feel at home by giving me free rein in her refrigerator, but I knew better. She was telling me there was no room for me at the family table. My grandmother would have seen the warning signs and probably steered me away.The two-pieces-of-meat rule was my grandmother\u2019s personal feminism expressed in the medium she knew best: food. It was a radical declaration of self-esteem. She would forge her own terms of being in a new family. I imagined that Beyonc\u00e9 would have made a similar demand had she lived in horse-and-buggy times.Grandma Daniels rejected the idea that women should get less of anything: whether education, respect, or protein. She would not pretend she had a preference for salad or lighter fare. There would be no skimping on her plate. Her appetite and preferences mattered. I remember her meat demands whenever someone says I\u2019m too much. Because before anyone said the catchphrase, \u201cKnow Your Worth,\u201d she knew that she was worth a seat at the table, a full plate, and then some. She would cook, but she would also be served.Explore Bon App\u00e9titValentines DayRead MorecookingMy Grandmother's Pineapple Dainties\u2014a Recipe from the Past That Still Holds UpBy Ali RosencultureHow My Grandmother Taught Me the Rules of Baking and LivingBy Jocelyn Delk AdamscookingRecreating Grandma Minnie's Mountains of Italian Christmas CookiesBy Chris MoroccoRecipes you want to make.
