Find out how to make one at home.By Emma WartzmanJune 21, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Ashley SullivanFacebookTwitterEmailWe all want to live life like we\u2019re on vacation in France, and though that is sadly not possible, we\u2019ve found a way you can be one step closer: French sodas. The combination of fizzy water, flavored simple syrup, and a splash of half-and-half over ice is exactly what you want in between your morning cold brew and your it\u2019s-finally-late-enough-to-start-drinking ros\u00e9 sangria.At Bellecour in Wayzata, MN, they started serving French sodas last year as a summertime treat. \u201cThey\u2019re increasingly popular,\u201d says general manager Jeanie Janas. \u201cPeople are asking about them, learning what they are. And now that summer has arrived we\u2019re excited to try new combinations.\u201d On the menu right now they have rosemary-berry, cocoa nib-coriander, lavender-vanilla, and\u2014while it\u2019s in season\u2014a rhubarb-orange zest, using syrup from roasted rhubarb they use in another dessert.A pro pouring half-and-half from up high at Bellecour.\nAshley Sullivan CreativeThe execution is easy and the possibilities are pretty much endless, which is what makes us excited to play around with them at home. You start by choosing a flavor base, which can be as simple as fruits like nectarines, peaches, or plums. Then add other ingredients like citrus zest, or spices like cinnamon or cardamom. Take inspiration from pie fillings if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.You then take your chosen flavors and bring them to a boil in a pot along with water and sugar, just like you would a normal simple syrup. In this case, though, Janas recommends changing up the normal 1:1 ratio since whatever fruit you\u2019re using will bring its own sweetness. \u201cAbout 60 percent water to 40 percent sugar is what you want,\u201d she says. Once the sugar has dissolved, you let everything steep and cool, and then strain through a fine-mesh sieve.Now, time to make a drink. Grab a glass and fill it with ice. Pour in 1 oz. of half-and-half, and \u00bd oz. of the cooled syrup, then top it off with about 6 oz. of fizzy water. For those who can\u2019t have dairy, milk substitutes work just fine (they offer almond and macadamia milk at the restaurant).\u201cThe best thing about these is that they are refreshing but satisfying at the same,\u201d Janas explains. \u201cYou have the fizzy water which lightens the drink up, and then the cream which makes it richer and gives it a nice mouthfeel. Basically, it\u2019s not heavy even though it has depth to it. It\u2019s like a creamsicle.\u201d And you don\u2019t even have to chase down the ice cream truck to get one.Explore Bon App\u00e9titSodaFrenchSummer DrinksFruitRead MorerecipesOur 43 Best Summer CocktailsGallery43 SlidesBy Mehreen KarimRecipes you want to make.
