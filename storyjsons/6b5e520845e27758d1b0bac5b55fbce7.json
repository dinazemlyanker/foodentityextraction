Even when I follow all of the extremely specific rules\u2014like getting the water to the exact right temperature; using good, fresh beans; weighing and grinding them each morning; pre-wetting the filter; doing essentially anything Chris Morocco tells me to\u2014somehow it still goes terribly wrong. Even when I tried to make cold brew concentrate overnight in the fridge (which is apparently easy), it ended up tasting like what I imagine the bottom of a shoe tastes like.I used to get around the problem by buying coffee on my commute to work every morning. Yes, it was expensive, but the real cincher is that I no longer have a commute. Instead of finding the silver lining and using this opportunity to finally learn to brew a decent cup, I\u2019ve turned to Stumptown Cold Brew Concentrate. The concentrate is a larger-format, longer-lasting version of their single-serving premade cold brews.Because it\u2019s double the strength of their normal cold brew, I can easily get 6\u20137 glasses per bottle, meaning it lasts all week in my fridge. Depending on the morning, I\u2019ll either pour it straight over ice and speed through a NYT\u2019s crossword in 20 minutes, or dilute it with water or milk. It's smooth, strong, and rich\u2014and I literally can\u2019t screw it up. It's also perfect for cocktails and baking projects where I want a strong kick of coffee.I no longer have a reason to attempt to make coffee at home, no matter how \u201cfoolproof\u201d someone\u2019s technique. So if anyone wants my French press, pour-over, AeroPress or Nespresso machine, I\u2019ll trade them all for a jug of cold brew concentrate.Stumptown Cold Brew Concentrate$12 $11 at Vons$14 at InstacartExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make.
