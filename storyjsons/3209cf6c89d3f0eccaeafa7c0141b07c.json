YUM!By Alex BeggsMay 9, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Amy WilsonFacebookTwitterEmailEvery Friday morning, Bon App\u00e9tit senior staff writer Alex Beggs shares weekly highlights from the BA offices, from awesome new recipes to office drama to restaurant recs, with some weird (food!) stuff she saw on the internet thrown in. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Smash the tatersWearing a souvenir apron of Michaelangelo\u2019s David\u2019s...frontside...a man named Bill manned the grill last weekend when we made a minor feast of Chris Morocco recipes, followed by one of Molly Baz recipes. Both were fabulous and I\u2019d highly recommend recreating them:Night 1: Chris\u2019s brisket with peanut-scallion salsa is a sleeper hit. The salsa is the star, though, and it works with anything you\u2019re grilling because it\u2019s crunchy, nutty, garlicky\u2014not very controversial qualities, unlike that apron. So we grilled steaks we got on sale, shout out to Hollywood Market in Troy, Michigan. Then on the side we had Chris\u2019s Big-Flavor Broccoli, which lived up to its name. At first you\u2019re like, soooo it\u2019s roasted broccoli? But the red onions you cook down first give it this low-key sweetness, anchovies dissolve into mysterious explosive umami, and you top it with CHEESE. I stood alone at the stove and watched the cheese melt onto the broccoli and thought, This is the best thing that\u2019s happened to me in a long time. Because it WAS.The recipes:Grilled Brisket with Scallion-Peanut SalsaBig-Flavor BroccoliPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Styling by Molly BazNight 2: Bless that salt goddess Molly Baz for her spicy (not thaaat spicy) coconut grilled chicken thighs and smashed potatoes. We made three pounds of potatoes and they disappeared immediately. Even if you mess them up, slightly overcooking them in the boiling water, which the recipe explicitly warns not to do\u2014it\u2019s fine. Because the smushy bits still got crispy in the hot oven and the walnut topping covers all sins. The chicken\u2019s marinade is made up of stuff that\u2019s usually in my pantry: coconut milk, anchovies, sambal, ginger, sugar, and lime juice. So I\u2019ll be making that again this summer, maybe with SHRIMP!?

All cereals are tiny cookies anyway; this seems like a natural progression. But may I remind you that Cheerios are still great? I\u2019ll even take HONEY NUT SCOOTERS, the bagged generic brand my mom bought spitefully, to be served with a nice bowl of 2 percent watermilk. Whatever gets ya going.Sweaty meats\u201cDo you like puffy bread and sweaty meats?\u201d I\u2019ve been listening to the hilarious \u201cOh, Hello\u201d p\u2019dcast (which investigates, uh, Princess Diana\u2019s death) and the fake commercials for Subway (pronounced \u201cS\u2019bwayyy\u201d) and other brands make me laugh-cry. The p\u2019dcast starts out deranged and only gets weirder from there. There\u2019s a specific Venn diagram of people this might appeal to, but I\u2019m hoping you\u2019re out there reading this.Photo by Marcus Nilsson, Food Styling by Frances Boswell, Prop Styling by Amy WilsonSpeaking ofSweaty meats! For a special occasion, we surprised someone with a box of pork chops from Heritage Foods, which is on Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s list of places to buy meat online. Now, with the Big Meat shortage and all that, this might be a good time to consider FISH and LENTILS, but if it\u2019s within your budget, Heritage works with farmers who take good care of their pigs, and we like that. (Also! Here\u2019s our online fish faves.)And those those chops, make: Sweet-and-Saucy Pork ChopsPhoto by Frank Heuer/laifHere\u2019s to JimmyThere was very sad news this week that Jimmy Glenn, owner of the perfect bar Jimmy\u2019s Corner, died due to Covid-19. Glenn, who was once a boxing trainer for Muhammed Ali and other legendary fighters, covered the bar\u2019s walls and tables with photos and memorabilia. I used to frequent that bar frequently when Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s offices were in Times Square (it\u2019s in our tourist guide to NYC too), and recently caught a glimpse of it during a scene in Raging Bull I never noticed before. I\u2019ll be raising an ice cold bottle of Budweiser to Jimmy this weekend.So that\u2019s a no on the vinegar?Unnecessary TikTok of the weekAccurate.Unnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekThis weekend is the holiday where people thank their mom for all her lovin\u2019 with a mess of toast crumbs on the comforter and spilled coffee on bedsheets she\u2019ll have to wash now. I like to start every morning with coffee and a book in bed, but a full-on breakfast? Are you crazy? I\u2019m not hungry yet! Who has the proper tray technology? I posed the question to the class:\u201cPersonally I\u2019m not interested in breakfast in bed,\u201d said Actual Mother Meryl Rothstein, \u201cbut tea in bed in silence is \ud83d\udc4c.\u201d \u201cBreakfast in bed is a scam!\u201d said man of many opinions Alex Delany. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason restaurants don\u2019t have beds next to the tables!\u201d Makes ya think. The takes rolled in. \u201cIt\u2019s because it\u2019s so against the rules that it feels like a little treat,\u201d said Jesse Sparks, whose family brings out an iconic wooden tray for these occasions. \u201cI ate seaweed in my bed last night. It was not a good idea,\u201d contributed Hilary Cadigan. Anna Stockwell has a tray \u201cthat\u2019s great for eating in bed AND for using as a computer stand for working or watching movies on my laptop.\u201d Joseph Hernandez popped in and dropped his own tweet on the subject matter: \u201cI have never understood \u2018breakfast in bed.\u2019 I don't wear shoes inside, why would I eat and drink in bed?\u201dBut Carla Lalli Music has the last word: \u201cThe thing my husband does for me is just unparalleled. He leaves the zoji of tea + cup on the bathroom sink. I wake up, I go to bathroom, I do what I have to do, take my tea and cup, and go straight back to bed. Contactless delivery. Keep your scones to yourself.\u201dP.S. I need your etiquette questions on the theme of family dinners for the Questionable Etiquette page. For example: Is it ever okay to use the same napkin five meals in a row?
