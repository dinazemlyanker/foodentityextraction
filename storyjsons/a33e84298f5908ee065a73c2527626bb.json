And not only does she want you to do it, she thinks you\u2019re really going to love the result.Wine experts can sometimes seem intimidating, but not Schwartz. Her eyes, often lined with bright colors, widen when she talks about the soil the grapes grow in, the winemakers\u2019 histories, and their connection to their vineyards. Schwartz and Anthony Roy are the co-founders of Thirsty Thirsty, a new natural wine-pairing dinner series in NYC that feels like a dinner party with thirty of your closest friends.\u201cI started working with wine when I was nineteen in New York,\u201d Schwartz told me at a recent Thirsty Thirsty at the perennially cool Lower East Side restaurant Dimes. At the time, she was working for the Manhattan hospitality group Silkstone, and one of the group\u2019s vegetable-focused restaurants, The Fat Radish. \u201cI got to sit in on tastings with the wine buyer because I begged hard enough. It was the first time I tasted anything that I felt I could understand. I felt like I actually loved the wine.\u201d Years later, she found out that the wine she was so in love with was natural: made without chemicals, sulfites, or filtering.After working in restaurants on both coasts, she moved to Lyon, France and worked at the natural wine cave and bar a vins, O Vins d'Anges under the owner, Sebastien Milleret. \u201cHe was the first man I encountered who genuinely wanted to uplift me and help me learn about wine,\u201d says Schwartz. \u201cEvery Monday and Tuesday we would drive to a different region of France, spend time with winemakers in their vines and at their lunch table and just talk. We'd then drive the wines back, stock the shop, and eventually pour the wines to customers throughout the weekend.\u201dWhile at O Vins d'Anges, Schwartz realized that she wanted to put natural wine in the glasses of more young people, so, when she got back to New York three years ago, she started Thirsty Thirsty, pouring natural rose at Cafe Henrie and summer wines paired with Italian snacks at Fitzcarraldo in Williamsburg.\u201cIt's festive but discreetly educational. It's also industry friendly, but I\u2019m more interested in bringing together friends of friends who are in different industries.\u201dSchwartz now works for Zev Rovine Selections, a natural wine distributor in New York that supplies restaurants like Mission Chinese Food, around the corner from Dimes, and The Four Horsemen in Brooklyn.At the Dimes dinner in May, Schwartz poured three different wines corresponding with the night\u2019s theme: an homage to Chinatown. \u201cWines are a perfect match with the complex flavors of Chinese cuisine, which are based on an ancient desire to uplift flavor, texture and terroir,\u201d Schwartz told the room. For $25, guests got three pours and an open buffet of steamed sesame buns, garlicky soy greens, and a seemingly endless supply of spring rolls. By sunset, guests had spilled out onto the sidewalk, still drinking, still holding plates of snacks, definitely not thinking about work the next day.\u201cPeople come to drink natural wines on the cheap with us. It also promotes a pretty magical no phone zone naturally that I'm particularly fond of,\u201d says Schwartz.Thirsty Thirsty doesn\u2019t have a set schedule, but Schwartz hinted at a big party happening this summer\u2026 on a farm! As soon as she plans it, she opens up invites to all of her Instagram followers on @thirstythirsty. Until the next one, Schwartz has a few tips for shopping for natural wine: \u201cGo for petillant naturel style wines (p\u00e9t-nats) and chilled red options. That is the way to anyone's heart and won't be too costly.\u201d And her best suggestion? \u201cWhen you find one you like, buy a magnum of it.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishnatural wineWineNew YorkTrendsRead MoreLifestyle11 Natural Wines That Taste as Good as They LookGallery11 SlidesBy Marissa A.
