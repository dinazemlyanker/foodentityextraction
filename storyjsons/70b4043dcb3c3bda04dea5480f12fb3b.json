Little did I know, I\u2019d met my desk lunch\u2019s perfect match.By Hilary CadiganMarch 2, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Laura MurrayFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.It appeared on the office free table with no explanation. A bottle of sauce with a piece of red velveteen over the top, tied with gold elastic. \u201cGeorgia Peach & Vidalia Onion Hot Sauce\u201d read the label, beside a storybook-esque illustration of a voluptuous red-headed lady sitting in a field of pink flowers. A blue ribbon denoted the years the sauce was deemed an \u201cInternational Champion\u201d and/or a \u201cNational Award Winner\u201d: 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001. How could I not be intrigued?Upon further investigation (which is to say, posting a question on our office Slack channel), I learned that the bottle came from my colleague Alex Beggs, who had recently attended the 2019 Hot Sauce Expo. There, she saw a lot of braided beards and tasted 47 hot sauces in six hours. \u201cI got that sauce from a man in a chicken hat,\u201d she tells me, wheeling past my desk in her swivel chair. \u201cIt\u2019s from Peppers.com.\u201dIf you haven\u2019t yet graced the fiery wonderland that is Peppers.com, let me fill you in. The homepage is dominated by a striking piece of stock imagery featuring a chile pepper in flames. The enormous online marketplace sells salsas, Bloody Mary mixes, chicken wing sauces, barbecue sauces, and of course, hot sauces. It\u2019s the digital baby of the aforementioned chicken-hatted guy, Chip Hearn, who followed in his father Luther\u2019s entrepreneurial footsteps by opening a series of ice cream shops in and around Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, in the 1970s.There he is, Chip Hearn, at the Expo!\nPhoto by Amy LombardThere are thousands of sauces for sale, and apparently Chip has tried all of them, but only one is advertised on the website\u2019s front page. And that is Georgia Peach & Vidalia Onion Hot Sauce, which Chip makes himself. \u201cFor all of you aficionados out there,\u201d reads the product page, \u201cthis sauce is also available in a gallon-size bottle.\u201dSo back to my desk, where the bottle\u2014a regular old 5-ouncer from Beggs\u2019 expo swag bag\u2014sat gathering dust beside my pencil cup and collection of unopened stress-reducing vitamins. There it remained until a couple weeks later, when someone delivered a batch full of burgers and French fries to our office without any ketchup. Lo! Not someone to suffer a naked French fry, I reached for the sauce. And that is when my office life, as I knew it, changed forever.You see, Georgia Peach & Vidalia Onion Hot Sauce is not your average hot sauce. It has dehydrated tomatoes in it which give ketchup vibes without taking over. Peaches, Vidalia onions, and cane sugar bring sweetness and a healthy dose of vinegar keeps things zesty. It has red chiles and green jalape\u00f1os and red cayenne peppers but not too much of any of them, so it\u2019s never too hot to handle and you needn\u2019t sprinkle it sparingly.Putting it on my fries proved a great success\u2014like ketchup, but better. So as the Mondays turned into Tuesdays turned into Thursdays, I kept going. Turkey sandwich\u2014yes. Cold pizza\u2014most def. Leftover fried rice\u2014a delight. I don\u2019t eat scrambled eggs at my desk, but if I did, I am 99.9% certain that it would be a match made in heaven.Georgia Peach & Vidalia Onion Hot Sauce, you see, is the ideal balance of acid, salt, sugar, and heat. It pairs perfectly with just about anything you throw at it. And in the days of open-plan offices, where storage space is minimal but you can\u2019t quite stomach the idea of a sad, dry desk lunch, it is a miracle. It is the go-on-everything desk sauce of my dreams. And I owe it all to a man in a chicken hat.Buy it: Georgia Peach & Vidalia Onion Hot Sauce, $5 at Peppers.comAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
