It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Ramps, ticks, and leaves\u201cWhat does poison ivy look like\u201d was typed in my phone screen and the blue progress bar wasn\u2019t moving a millimeter. Mosquitos or some other bugs were buzzing in my face and my friends were bent over among the probably-not-poison-ivy, slicing wild ramps from their bulb base. We\u2019d pulled over on the side of a country road in Connecticut, where ramps grow like weeds for a few weeks every spring. Another tab on my phone was open, \u201cillegal foraging connecticut laws\u201d\u2014also not loading. Oh well! My outdoorsy friend Justin led the way, telling us how to clear the brush before cutting the ramp, make sure to leave plenty behind to grow back next year. Justin could spot the fiery-garlic bombs from the road by the plant\u2019s floppy, bunny ear-like leaves, the way they grow in friendly patches. Over a weekend, we collected pounds of ramps to take home and pickle, turn into pesto, grill, scramble with eggs, fritter, and experiment with fancy compound butters. It was as bougie as it sounds.Get the recipe: Ramp FrittersPhoto by Chelsie Craig, styling by Claire SaffitzMake cakeLast weekend, Jesse Sparks and Friends (watch out for their new morning show) made Molly Baz\u2019s Blackout Chocolate Banana Bread. The bananas on top sank a bit, but the rich, chocolatey-but-not-dense cake was a winner, said Jesse. It combines the best of two worlds, chocolate blackout cake and moist banana bread! \u201cI\u2019d make it again in a heartbeat,\u201d he said.Get the recipe: Blackout Chocolate Banana BreadWant this letter before it hits the website?

Only one chef could have come up with such a devastatingly romantic way to propose to his love, Lindsey Brown, and that\u2019s the big-hearted Houston chef Chris Shepherd. Lindsey told me Chris presented her with a bowl of crawfish at a party that were supposedly extra spicy, so she ate a few, and realized they weren\u2019t spicy at all. And then she noticed the ring. \u201cChris said that\u2019s exactly how he sees me,\u201d Lindsey added, \u201cstuffing my face with crawfish.\u201d \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96Photo by Keystone-France \\ Gamma-Rapho via Getty ImagesIt\u2019s asparagus sznSo you should probably make Andy Baraghani\u2019s new recipe for a super easy asparagus stir-fry that you finish off with soy sauce, butter, and orange juice. If those three things make you go: le huh? Do NOT knock it \u2018til you try it. There\u2019s sweetness and salt, a little heat from a chile pepper, and the butter coats everything all glaze-y good. We\u2019re obsessed with this Healthyish recipe.Get the recipe: Simple and Citrusy Asparagus Stir-FryPhoto by Daniel Zuchnik/GC ImagesWhen food meets fashionThe Met Gala, fashion\u2019s annual costume party, was this week and in accordance, or defiance, of the \u201ccamp\u201d theme Katy Perry changed out of her chandelier dress and into a hamburger (or was it a slider?) getup. It looked heavy on the lettuce if you ask me. Are burgers \u201ccamp\u201d? I wondered for three passing seconds. I asked GQ style writer Rachel Tashjian for her professional review of Perry\u2019s burger look. \u201cWell done,\u201d she answered.Unnecessary food meme of the weekLiquid death comes in many formsLate last year, a new canned water came into the marketplace, filling a void with somehow, an even bigger void. Liquid Death, hardcore water from Austria with millions of dollars of funding and recyclable cans, will MURDER YOUR THIRST. Reviewers say it \u201cdoesn't decapitate my thirst like the marketing claims,\u201d \u201cit is better than generic water,\u201d and \u201cdragged my thirst down a dark alley and ruthlessly beat it within an inch of its life with a baseball bat.\u201d But the company better watch out, the competition is coming in hot.Unnecessary food feud of the weekSpeaking of liquid death, it\u2019s Mothers\u2019 Day this weekend! When I was a kid, my mom drank a pint glass\u2013sized White Russian every evening while watching Entertainment Tonight in bed. Fond memories. Today, I honor her by drinking it at every appropriate occasion. And you know what? It\u2019s a delicious drink. It\u2019s a liquid coffee milkshake! But others on staff feel it is liquid death, such as Emily \u201cSunburnt\u201d Schultz who made a vomitous groan when I asked her how she felt about the cocktail. \u201cMy stomach is rumbling just thinking about it,\u201d she said. For others, it\u2019s nostalgic. The drink takes Adam Rapoport back to his relatives\u2019 basement in Milwaukee, where the adults would \u201cpound White Russians all day long while eating cold kielbasa and cocktail sauce.\u201d Not a bad life. However, he \u201ccan\u2019t handle all that dairy.\u201d Carla Lalli Music ordered a White Russian on the first date with her now-husband, who ordered a Campari and soda and laughed, \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d She was not! Love sprungeth forth. \u201cThey\u2019re delicious but disgusting,\u201d offered Meryl Rothstein. Molly Baz confessed she went through a pretty serious Black Russian phase in college (i.e. hold the cream). Chris Morocco gave me a look of horror and disappointment: \u201cDidn\u2019t we just leave Kalhua behind?\u201d I had to know what our copy chief Greg Robertson thought about the whole thing. \u201cHow do you feel about white russians?\u201d I messaged him. \u201cCap it (we follow Webster\u2019s for cocktail names).\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecultureA Tale of Two Buttcheeks: Rating New York\u2019s New Restaurant ChairsBy Alex BeggscultureIs It Ever Okay...
