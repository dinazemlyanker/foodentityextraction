It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Belated postcard from ParisFlorence\u2019s Paris apartment was filled with art and strings of colorful baubles. There was a miniature dollhouse kitchen scene displayed on a bookshelf; a huge oil painting consuming the entire wall of a teeny guest bathroom. So many DVDs! This was the first time I\u2019d stayed in an Airbnb that was actually, clearly, someone\u2019s home. So I kept joking that we\u2019d return from dinner one night and Flo would be there, watching TV on the couch. Well...On my birthday, halfway through shaving my right leg in a luxurious Airbnb birthday bath, the doorbell rang. Assuming it was Bill (classic Bill) back from his run and too lazy to use the key, I ignored it. Until the door opened and a voice called out, \u201calooooooooo?\u201d It was indeed Florence!!! She\u2019d forgotten medication she needed, which happened to be in the bathroom where I was occupied in ze nude. So that\u2014plus treating myself to a tortoiseshell hair comb with my name engraved upon it, and the big beans at La Buvette, and the blood sausage at Le Verre Vol\u00e9, and a long lunch at the perfect restaurant Mokonuts\u2014was the highlight of my trip to Paris.Back now!Want this letter before it hits the website?

Yesss!The first thing I cookedWas Andy Baraghani\u2019s caramelized cabbage (which SO MANY people are making!). It was ridiculously good. \u201cI would not have imagined that cabbage could taste this good,\u201d wrote Anonymous from Maryland. (That\u2019s from the generous tomato paste + spice combo.) I loved it so much I had to ration it out in my lunch this week because overeating cabbage risks a gaseous condition I call \u201cdeflating mattress farts.\u201d A nonstop stream of toots. Disturbing.Get the recipe: Fall-Apart Caramelized CabbageTrader Joe's store in New York City.Photo by Michael Brochstein/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesIn memoriamI was saddened to hear the news that the founder of Trader Joe\u2019s, Joseph Coulombe, passed away last week. (Maybe some of you know about my life\u2019s work reviewing the store\u2019s new snacks, which comes from a place of love and devotion.) He wanted the store to be for \u201covereducated and underpaid people, for all the classical musicians, museum curators, journalists.\u201d Gotta love that specificity. I\u2019ll be raising a spicy cheese crunchy in his honor.In lady newsThis week, I read that the good martini restaurant Long Island Bar no longer calls their single-patty burger the \u201cLadies\u2019 Burger.\u201d Great, cool, fab. Alas, for every inch forward, a giant leap back, because I ALSO read that the new terrible bad restaurant from Mr. Salt Bae has a \u201cFREE FOR LADIES\u201d veggie burger that sounds like a crime against broccoli and gender discrimination laws.Get yourself a tube of almond pasteI baked the famous Chez Panisse almond cake following David Leibovitz\u2019s recipe last weekend and it might be my new favorite cake in the world. It\u2019s buttery, eggy, almondy moist sponge. It all happens in the food processor and I even froze a wedge of it for later. I love that about a cake: staying power.P&VLittle did I know when I invented a hard drink known as \u201chard prune juice\u201d that Amiel Stanek was lightyears ahead of me. His recipe: drink half of a container of prune juice, then add vodka, give it a light shake to combine, and drink in a dark alleyway. \u201cAnd you\u2019re supposed to drink it FAST.\u201d Noted.Read more: 17 New Hard Drinks the World Isn\u2019t Ready ForEdit of the weekU got it, Meryl!!Tag of the weekUnnecessary food meme of the weekThis one really hit home.Unnecessary food feud of the weekPhoto by Ted CavanaughSarah Jampel asked the room: \u201cPeople who have a gooseneck kettle, are you annoyed by how slowly it pours when you're using it for something other than coffee?\u201d \u201cIt makes me feel fancy!\u201d said Aliza Abarbanel. Amanda Shapiro is never annoyed by it, and, \u201cit\u2019s perfect for watering my plants.\u201dWell I am annoyed! I use my kettle to make tea, instant oats, and to fill crusty pots with soapy water to soak; I switched from a gooseneck to this Cuisinart electric kettle that heats nearly instantly and I\u2019m never going back. Jesse Sparks is with me: \u201cGet a normal kettle and pour it slowly\u2014it\u2019s called mindfulness,\u201d he said. Jampel is conflicted, as you can tell from the variation from lowercase to CAPS: \u201cI\u2019ve always wished that my neck were longer, so I admire them/they make me feel elegant,\u201d she said. \u201cI love the CONTROL they offer, but when you need to pour FAST, like when you\u2019re soaking rice noodles, they are PAINFULLY slow.\u201dAlex Delany uses his gooseneck for pour-over coffee and can\u2019t fathom a situation in which he\u2019d use it otherwise: \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re wasting years of your life because you have a gooseneck kettle,\u201d he noted, gazing into both my past and future. Chris Morocco is obsessed with his: \u201cStagg is the best I have found. Annoying for tea because it comes out so slowly, still worth it.\u201d (Maybe you\u2019ve spotted the matte black kettle on his station in Test Kitchen videos.) Well this was a feud that didn\u2019t really go anywhere. But some weeks are like that.Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead Moreculture17 New Hard Drinks the World Isn\u2019t Ready ForBy Alex BeggscultureThere\u2019s an Entire Industry Dedicated to Making Foods Crispy, and It Is WILDBy Alex BeggscultureIs It Ever Okay...to Bring 11 Items to the 10 Items or Less Aisle?By Alex BeggscultureTrader Joe\u2019s Latest Snacks, Reviewed in These Strange, Strange TimesBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
