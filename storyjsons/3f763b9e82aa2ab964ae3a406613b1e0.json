Not everybody, obviously, but certainly enough people with enough intensity that a distaste for this particular fruit isn\u2019t exactly a niche position. For the record, I wouldn\u2019t say I hate green bell peppers, but I certainly don\u2019t seek them out. More than anything else, I think they taste, well, kind of boring\u2014unripe (which they are), a bit bitter, watery. But I\u2019m not here to trash green bell peppers; I\u2019m a solutions-oriented person. Instead, I\u2019m here to talk about a green pepper I do like, one I think tastes simply marvelous and deserves as much adulation as the aforementioned pepper gets vitriol: the poblano.I love poblano peppers! To me they taste like everything a green bell pepper aspires toward, as different as a ruby-ripe heirloom tomato is from the wan simulacra you\u2019ll find at a New York supermarket in December. Poblanos are deeply earthy, dense, and meaty, with an appealing balance between fruitiness and bitterness that lends complexity to so many dishes. And because they deliver the suggestion of chile heat\u2014green poblanos usually clock in at 1000\u20131500 units on the Scoville scale, around half that of the mildest jalape\u00f1o\u2014they keep you on your toes without delivering a sucker punch. They pair especially well with cream (as in rajas con crema), melty cheese, and other rich, fatty elements. (It\u2019s worth noting that green poblanos can turn red and ripen, at which point they\u2019re spicier. They\u2019re typically dried and referred to as anchos.)Cheese, please!\nPhoto by Molly BazAdding a few to this corn pudding recipe was a no-brainer to me\u2014they lent just the right amount of warmth and intrigue to an otherwise one-note dairy party. And I also loved them in this recipe for garlicky smashed chickpeas from Abra Berens\u2019s new cookbook, Grist, where they play nice with the earthiness of the legumes and the sweetness of fresh corn. I\u2019ve had success subbing them in whenever cooked green bell peppers are called for, like in gumbo, and I bet they would taste absolutely smashing on a pizza alongside rings of white onions and nubbins of sausage.Which is all to say, for the green bell pepper haters out there, enough is enough. Stop wasting your time fixating on a fruit you don\u2019t like\u2014a better pepper is just around the corner.Put some pepp in your step:Garlicky Smashed Chickpeas With CornThese aren\u2019t your average crispy chickpeas\u2013here, garlicky garbanzos get lightly smashed before frying, creating layers of texture.View RecipeRecipes you want to make.
