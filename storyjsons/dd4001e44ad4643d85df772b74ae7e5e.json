Here Hall uses her Country Ham Potlikker as an umami-rich base for a spicy vinaigrette that gets its silky texture from blended cannellini beans. More beans are then mixed with roasted squash, apple, and fennel for a delightful mix of crunchy and creamy textures. Making the Country Ham Potlikker is a crucial first step, so be sure to read through that recipe before you get started.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.
