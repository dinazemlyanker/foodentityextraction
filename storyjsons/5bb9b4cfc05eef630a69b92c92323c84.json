Melt the butter in a 10-inch nonstick ovenproof skillet over medium-high. Add the sausage and break up meat into small pieces with a wooden spoon then spread out in the pan to create a single layer. Cook, undisturbed, until the bottom side is browned and crisp, about 3 minutes. Break up meat again and turn over pieces. Cook until the other side is browned and crisp and meat is cooked through, about 3 more minutes.Increase the heat to high and add the spinach. Cook, tossing with tongs, until the spinach is wilted and all the liquid has evaporated, about 3 minutes.Meanwhile, using a fork, beat the eggs with the milk until well combined. Beat in \u00bd cup of parmesan, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and \u00bc teaspoon pepper.Pour egg mixture into skillet; cook over medium-high, slowly stirring with a spatula, scraping the bottoms and sides, to create large curds, until eggs are wet on top but otherwise set throughout, 2 to 3 minutes.Transfer to oven; broil until puffed and browning in spots and eggs are just set, about 3 minutes.Remove from the oven and spread Rao\u2019s Homemade Arrabbiata sauce over the top of the cooked frittata. Arrange the mozzarella over the sauce. Return to the oven and broil until sauce is hot and cheese is golden and bubbly, 4 to 5 minutes.Top with remaining 2 tablespoons of parmesan and basil leaves. Let stand 5 minutes before slicing.Recipe by Rao\u2019s Homemade\u00aeReviews SectionReviewsWrite a review\u2026This is delicious!!! I've made it several times and it's a huge hit. This recipe is so easy and versatile. It's now my go-to Friday night dinner instead of pizza. Dinner, breakfast, brunch, DELICIOUS!!! \nThe last time I made it I only had 10 eggs, and it turned out just fine. I also cut back on the sauce a bit. I don't eat pork but found a delicious chicken sausage substitute. AnonymousNashville, TN09/12/19This is delicious.  I baked the frittata to set the eggs, and broiled it after adding about 3/4 of the jar of sauce and the mozzarella.  I\u2019ll definitely make this again.Maggie945Alamo CA05/31/19GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for the Bon App\u00e9titNewsletterSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyExplore Bon App\u00e9titRao\u2019s Homemade\u00aeSponsoredMore from Bon App\u00e9titRecipes6 Pro Chefs Reveal Their \"Secret Weapon\" Ingredients2022-03-02T17:00:00.000ZrecipePorcini Gnocchi With Butter Sauce2022-03-15T09:00:00.000ZrecipeWhiskey Sour2020-12-16T18:20:00.000ZBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
