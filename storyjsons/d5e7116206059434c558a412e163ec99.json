See our past recommendations here!Like a true Virgo, I love a good system. I was the child who kept her stuffed animals in order by height on her (neatly made) bed. And now I\u2019m the adult who organizes her pantry items\u2014by type and expiration date\u2014in these bins of various sizes and shapes.Don\u2019t ask me why these bins are described on Amazon as \u201cfarmhouse decor.\u201d They\u2019re made of metal, extremely utilitarian, and perfectly suitable for my Brooklyn apartment. I use one for canned beans, one for boxes of pasta, two for snacks (sweet and savory), and one big boi for stuff I buy in bulk like salt, olive oil, oats, and Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos. Older or more perishable items stay at the front. Recently I bought a sixth bin, which I\u2019ll put under the sink in my bathroom to hold all the travel-sized soaps, shampoos, and toothpastes I can\u2019t bear to throw away.I would probably own ten more of these bins if I had unlimited funds\u2014to hold dog treats, desk stuff, cleaning supplies, etc\u2014but I had to stop somewhere. Now I\u2019m saving up for a set of stackable glass jars and these expandable drawer dividers. Because being organized isn\u2019t a hobby; it\u2019s a way of life.Buy it: M Design Metal Wire Food Storage Organizer, $23 for 2All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
