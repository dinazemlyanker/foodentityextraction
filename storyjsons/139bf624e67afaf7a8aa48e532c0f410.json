I know, RANDOM!) and I did not have rice vinegar, so I used lime vinegar, but it didnt matter... it was SO GOOD!\nBright, balanced, full of flavor, and the most important...very easy, no oven required :)!Alejandra CarrilloTijuana, M\u00e9xico3/4/2021I have made this twice and both times it was amazing.  Lots of flavor but the Jalape\u00f1o was not overwhelming.  I would recommend making it.  Low carb. and very delicious.Andrea CoxGrand Lake, Colorado5/11/2020So so so good. Bright, vibrant and comes together really fast! A treat on a weeknight. Anonymous1/28/2020Really good and not very difficult. It sort of just comes together out of nowhere. It's well balanced. I would have never considered grapefruit as something to go with jalapeno and salmon, but it works really well. It's just the right amount.AnonymousVallejo, CA12/14/2019Perfect weeknight meal. The sauce is amazing. My partner isn't a fan of grapefruit, but he had no complaints. The grapefruit flavor is very mild. Will definitely make again.alrr0610Oak Park, IL 3/15/2019So delicious and came together really quickly! The sauce is definitely the star here!AnonymousBrooklyn1/29/2019I meant five stars!gailgh2Southern California1/28/2019I used pink grapefruit - have a tree in my yard. I never saw what one was supposed to do with the green chile kosho - decided that it was supposed to be mixed with the grapefruit juice and vinegar dressing. Used an iron skillet, not \"nonstick.\" Also I thought that it needed a little extra - had not eaten much all day, so put some basmati rice on the plate with the vegetables and fish. This was delicious!gailgh2Southern California1/28/2019Delicious! Did not have endive so thinly sliced raw celery instead which worked great. AnonymousPhiladelphia 1/16/2019Loved this so much! Had a bunch of broccoli to use up so I subbed that for the broccolini and added coconut rice to balance out. Salmon was a thick cut so took a lot longer to cook but the sauce is DELICIOUS. Will definitely make again. Thanks Chris!AnonymousBrooklyn 1/16/2019The star of this dish is the green chile kosho. My partner doesn't care for grapefruit, so we substituted blood orange and it was still delicious. I didn't find it as fast as some other folks are commenting, but maybe I just move slow. I love the idea of using a blender for the sauce.austin738257923840921/13/2019Made this last night and it was amazing. We absolutely devoured this.  It's really easy and fast to put together.   Loved the sauce and combination of flavors of fish and crunch, etc.  Definitely will make again. Anonymous1/9/2019I made the sauce in a blender because I thought it would take less time and it still came out really great! I combined the vingear and grapefruit right into the blender when I did this because it needed more liquid. Also, I cooked the fish and ate it for lunch the next day with the leftover grapefruit I had cut for the juice. Very good. eschultzBonAppetit.com1/8/2019This is so FAST! And full of flavor. Will definitely incorporate into my weeknight dinner rotation. I left all the seeds in because I like things spicy and it was great.AnonymousNew York 1/8/2019This was a great meal, loved the sauce exactly as written and the endive was a nice contrast with everything.
