Wash it all down with a back-to-basics dirty burger and on-point poutine, both of which will be delivered from the kitchen of Campagnolo, the sister restaurant downstairs.THE VIBE IS: your uncle\u2019s 1980 billiards-green basement with cinder-block walls and a bar, except you go upstairs to get to it instead of down. The door to Camp Upstairs, as the dive bar is lovingly dubbed, isn\u2019t obvious from the street, so it should be easy to find an open barstool.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day, from 6 p.m. to whenever the staff pleases. No reservations.\u2014Lindsay AndersonGrant HarderGrant HarderWE ALSO LOVEGrapes & SodaKitsilano\u2019s blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it destination for cocktails and natural wine The DiamondProhibition-era glam (and meticulously made cocktails) in GastownRodney\u2019s Oyster HouseSerious oyster curation in Yaletown, but that\u2019s about where the seriousness endsExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
