It\u2019s worth saving some money when you\u2019ll be breaking down the lobsters and pulling out all the meat anyway. This recipe is from Larsen\u2019s Fish Market, a tiny little seafood shack in the tiny little fishing village of Menemsha, Martha\u2019s Vineyard.IngredientsMakes 651\u00bc lb. lobsters, preferably culls\u00bccup mayonnaise2celery stalks, finely chopped6hot dog bunsPreparationStep 1Pour water into a large pot to come 3\u201d up the sides. Cover and bring to a boil. Add lobsters, reduce heat to medium, and re-cover pot. Steam lobsters 15 minutes. Using tongs, remove lobsters from pot and transfer to a large bowl. Pour in ice water to cover; let cool.Step 2Break off lobster tails. Pull off the flippers and use your thumb to push the tail meat up and out of the shell from the bottom (like a push-up pop). Crack claws with the back of a knife and remove meat. Chop tail and claw meat into \u00bd\u201d pieces and place in a medium bowl. Mix in mayonnaise and celery; season with salt and pepper. Divide lobster salad among buns.Step 3Do Ahead: Lobster salad can be made 2 days ahead.

They don\u2019t serve chips on the side and the food is served on a crate not a laquered wood table. No need to blow up a local spot.Lindsay.rappaport4/23/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSandwichNew EnglandAmericanLobsterShellfishSeafoodSummerMainDairy-FreeNut-FreeSteamLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
