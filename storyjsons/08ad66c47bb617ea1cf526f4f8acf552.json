Here\u2019s what\u2019s good and what\u2019s frightening.By Alex BeggsOctober 7, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailI will never understand the cinnamon broomsticks. Every year Trader Joe\u2019s sells these unsweepable decorative cinnamon-scented brooms that this witch would never use to fly outta town. There\u2019s something unnerving about the illustration on them, an old-timey woman sweeping the yard (?) while a human-size turkey (!) lurks behind her shoulder, ready to kill.So I didn\u2019t buy a haunted broom on this trip. But they\u2019re in stores now, stinking up the place, which means it\u2019s fall and the pumpkin stuff is here too. On to it!Cake MixesGluten-Free Pumpkin Bread MixPretty neat that this is made with sorghum flour, a naturally nutty-sweet flour made from a resilient ancient grain. (Make these cookies plz!) The cake was tender and moist with a spongy crumb, but it leaves a very delicate sandy texture in your mouth and a slightly bitter aftertaste. Add chocolate chips to fix that and generally every other problem.Chocolate Mochi Cake MixYou know your corporation is doing something right when your new food products have reputations. Like this cake, which I heard was bad before I even bought it. However, innocent until proven guilty and all that, so I made the cake and ate a warm slice of it and it was mildly chocolaty with bonus\u2014chocolate chips!\u2014and it had that delightful mochi spring in its step. Bounce bounce bounce. I skipped making the peanut butter buttercream (it comes powdered? suspect) out of laziness and a need for warm cake. Maybe the frosting\u2019s the bad part. On day two \u00a0my cake was dried out and stale, and I chewed it like a cow in a field snacking on grass after three weeks of drought. Mooooooving on.Baking Stuff, Cont\u2019dCaramel Sea Salt Baking ChipsMmm, is that palm kernel oil? These not-chocolate chips taste like caramel-flavored coffee. There\u2019s a hint of salt, but do NOT assume that means you shouldn\u2019t salt your cookies after baking. Never, ever stop. I don\u2019t care what phase of cookie trend we\u2019re in, KEEP ON SALTIN\u2019.Vanilla Bean PasteSO COOL this exists and is at Trader Joe\u2019s, in a smaller jar than I would like but whattyagonnado. When you bake with vanilla bean paste in place of vanilla extract, the flavor\u2019s basically the same, but you get this rustic speckle in whatever you\u2019re making. Love that.Pumpkin SpreadA pumpkin jelly thing you serve on your autumnal cheese plate, along with some twigs from the yard for a touch of authenticity (and is that dog pee?). But here\u2019s an idea: Use this in place of sugar to make a pumpkin spice old-fashioned: 1 Tbsp. of \u201cspread\u201d in the bottom of your mixing glass + a few shakes of bitters, muddle that up, + 2 oz. bourbon, add ice and stir, strain over a glass of ice and garnish with orange peel.Brightly Packaged ThingsSpiced Pumpkin Madeleine CookiesThese are great; dip them in coffee. Not too pumpkin-y, and apparently the pumpkin is dried pumpkin flakes? Had no idea that existed. Oh, interesting, you can buy it for dogs who have diarrhea. Poor fellas.Crispy Thai Chilies & Sesame SeedsThese crispy, wispy, spicy snacks with a subtle sesame flavor are very entertaining to eat out of the bag, or you can top bland stuff with them for a WHOOSHBANG taste bud attack. The downside is that eating chile pepper skins, like tomato skins, is like eating wax paper. Even when they\u2019re fried and filled with sesame seeds. So when your saliva hits them the chiles melt and soften, but they don\u2019t shatter. Hey, I\u2019m just giving you the tools you need to make informed purchases.Tricolor SpaghettiYou know it\u2019s really fall when even the pasta is changing colors. I drive along the desolate country roads of the American Midwest in search of the changing pasta colors, seeking out the sage green and pumpkin-hued spaghetti, blasting Fleet Foxes and sweating in my flannel. Isn\u2019t this the greatest season? The pasta, though, tastes like pasta.Kintamani Small Lot CoffeeForgettable!Jasmine RiceRice, but branded!Pumpkin AtrocitiesPumpkin Spice Hummus\u00a0I read somewhere that in an early draft of Frankenstein, Mary Shelley has the monster roaming the aisles of Trader Joe\u2019s\u2014turns out, he\u2019s vegan\u2014and he smashes on some pumpkin spice hummus before continuing the angsty search for his papa. Editors thought it was \u201ctoo spon con\u201d so she cut it. But that\u2019s why we see pumpkin spice hummus at Trader Joe\u2019s during this spooky time of year. Like the monster, it\u2019s deeply misunderstood. It tastes kind of like carrot cake frosting, and it\u2019s great for dipping graham crackers in. It is not, however, savory or good with savory dippers, like baby carrots or chips\u2014that\u2019s when things get weird. Sample at your own risk.Pumpkin Four Cheese DipWe\u2019ve got lightly spiced pur\u00e9ed pumpkin with cream cheese, Greek yog, and shredded Monterey jack in a dip you\u2019re supposed to HEAT up before serving. I tried it cold\u2014gag, gag, gag. Then I microwaved it as recommended. Now I will say, with a salty enough chip, your taste buds can pick out the melted cheese and disregard the pumpkin, and they say humans have survived on this for years in some remote parts of Alaska. But look too close and you\u2019ll notice that the dip oozes off the chip not unlike a deep-winter booger. Which reminds me, gotta schedule a flu shot!Cheeses & Non-CheesesCheddar Cheese with Scotch Bonnet Chili PeppersVery sweet and not spicy at all? Has corn flour in it?? Creamy? I was not expecting any of this.Green Goddess GoudaCreamy, garlicky, herby. Tastes like ravioli filling.Vegan Cream Cheese AlternativeImpressed! It\u2019s got that tangy cream cheese flavor, cloaked in shiny coconut oil. Like dairy cream cheese, it\u2019s very hard to spread, and this stays solid even when it\u2019s room temperature. No biggie.Shredded Parmesan Cheese AlternativeNa na na na na na na nope. This ambitious cheese alternative has an off-putting sweetness. I think if I were vegan looking for a pasta topping alt, I\u2019d go with nutritional yeast over this flavored potato starch. But I do believe impressive progress is being made in the world of cheese alternatives, and that\u2019s called \u201cending on a high note.\u201dJars o\u2019 StuffIndian Garlic AchaarSuuuper garlicky\u2014yum\u2014rounded out with tangy red pepper. I ate it with the spicy pumpkin samosas and veggie bites, reviewed below.Kalamata Olives\u00a0Oops, there\u2019s a new version of these olives that\u2019s spicy but I got the boring one. Boring.Green Goddess Seasoning BlendToo much onion, not enough goddess.Brown ButterNutty grease.High-Oleic Sunflower OilHigh oleic, high smoke point, high hopes. Turns out it\u2019s just oil!Green Frozen BagsApple Cinnamon Oatmeal BitesBreakfast arancini! Portable! These are lil\u2019 oatmeal bombs with a crispy breadcrumb-and-sugar crust. I air-fried them, of course. Note: They WILL leave greasy sugar fingerprints all over your steering wheel, keyboard, or crime scene.Organic Veggie BitesThese look like beaver scat, but don\u2019t judge a book by its cover etc etc etc! These are a space-age snack of mushed vegetables, probably a lot of potato plus three carrot cubes, formed into a dense \u201cbite.\u201d You bite the bite, it\u2019s very meta. I watched as my partner spooned sour cream straight from the container, set a bite on top, and ate that, bite-after-bite. What a fright!Frozen Orange BoxesMini Pumpkin Spicy SamosasPumpkin isn\u2019t always pumpkin spice, okay?! Sometimes it\u2019s SPICY. PUMPKIN. Which is even better. There\u2019s a nice heat to these crispy samosas and more importantly, there\u2019s salty creamy paneer in the filling.Butternut Squash Mac & Cheese BitesWhenever I eat finger foods from Trader Joe\u2019s I picture myself as a wedding planner helping the lovely bride/groom decide which apps to pass around their cocktail hour. Because if I were the type of person to want to get legally bound to another human, I\u2019d want to kick off the party with some Trader Joe\u2019s passed apps. No one does it better!* So I\u2019d tell the happy couple, serve the butternut balls with a compostable fork because they fall apart on the first bite, not unlike the fate of this marriage. They\u2019re still wonderful, don\u2019t get me wrong, just don\u2019t forget the fork, and a good attorney.*maaaybe Cheesecake Factory doesSweet Cinnamon Filled Korean PancakesHello, hotteok! The key to preparing these from frozen is to let them defrost for 30 minutes or so, then fry them in a dry skillet for 3 to 4 minutes, but don\u2019t overdo it or they\u2019ll dry out and you won\u2019t get that pillowy, chewy texture that yields to a sweet cinnamon goo inside. Love these.Hatch Chile QuicheOkay, so it\u2019s a spicy quiche with a corn tortilla chip crust. Creative! The second bite brought the heat; the third brought the malaise. The center of the crust was unfortunately soggy due to the plastic tray it bakes in. Overall: really, really decent.Eggwich Breadless Breakfast SandwichesThe perfect square of frozen American cheese, bright, plasticky yellow circles of egg-cornstarch-milk patties\u2014is this Lego food? The turkey sausage cooks to this gorgeous gray that only turkey can pull off. Delicious. As satisfying and greasy as a McMuffin, sans muffin. Still not sure why people are so scared of bread, but if you know, don\u2019t tell me.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCultureFallTrader Joe'sRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
