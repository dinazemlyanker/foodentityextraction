I thought it looked interesting, healthy and different. I had the chia seeds, I love coconut and wanted to try tapioca. So I took the plunge. It was fun making this BUT, as I told my husband while we were eating it, \"it's like the dessert from a different planet\". Just not impressed. With all the fruit prep, it looks pretty but not worth making again. Taste is just ok with a strange twist because of the texture. CFooteSouthern California3/28/2019I really liked this! It makes a really tasty dessert, and it's easy to make apart from the overnight soaking.\n\nNotes: I did omit the 1/3c agave initially, because I like things less sweet and I find that coconut milk and pineapple already have a bit of sweetness to them, and I just drizzled a little over the top to serve - it was quite sweet enough for me. I also served it without the extra toppings because I was lazy and didn't have more pineapple or mango on hand, and it was delicious regardless! I used black chia seeds instead of white because I have a surplus. Other than making it a slightly gray color in places with the swollen seeds, it didn't affect the taste at all.\n\n(For Anonymous below, I used Hoosier Hill Farm Large #40 Tapioca Pearls from Amazon.com, and they worked really well. I even left them soaking for two days in the fridge without them disintegrating.)eurystomusSeattle WA1/17/2019The large pearl tapioca that I've been able to find locally would not work in this recipe. When I add them to any liquid to soak, they immediately start to dissolve and break down. Within 30 minutes, they are a layer of white grainy smush at the bottom of the bowl. Where can I find the type of pearls which you use and what are they called? I've purchased to different brands and they've both done the same in liquid.AnonymousColumbia, MO4/15/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titPuddingDessertTapiocaOther IngredientsChiaSeedCoconutFruitCoconut MilkPineappleQuickDairy-FreeGluten-FreeVeganHealthyishSimmerRecipes you want to make.
