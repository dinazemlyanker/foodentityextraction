They\u2019re like footie pajamas (shirt, pants, and socks) for your spice cabinet. Five-spice powder, a mix that\u2019s common in China, Taiwan, and certain parts of Vietnam and Thailand, is no exception. It's the one-ingredient reason these Sweet-Sticky Five-Spice Pork Ribs complex and aromatic, with just a whisper of sweetness.Five-spice has a consistent flavor profile\u2014think warming, deep, and distinctly spicy without being fiery\u2014but it isn\u2019t always made up of the same five spices (and there aren\u2019t always , or even usually, five of them). The number actually refers to the five traditional Chinese elements (wood, fire, earth, metal, and water) and flavors (sweet, bitter, sour, salty, and acrid/pungent), of which five-spice achieves a harmonious balance.No salt added? That's your ticket.\nMost blends from China include star anise, cinnamon or its close relative cassia, cloves, Sichuan peppercorns, and fennel seeds, but the mix can also contain ginger, nutmeg, turmeric, galangal, Mandarin orange peel, white or black pepper, and licorice. (That\u2019s way more than five ingredients, if you\u2019re counting.)Traditionally, five-spice is used to complement fatty meats, like duck, goose, or pork, in marinades, stews, and braises. And it can add warmth without sugary sweetness to lots of other dishes, as well. Try adding a smidge to your favorite nut or snack mix, fall fruit galette, banana bread, sugar cookie dough, cream cheese frosting, carrot cake, or granola. Or simply sprinkle some in when you're whipping cream or simmering oatmeal. Start conservatively\u2014five-spice is pungent (and you can always add more).When you\u2019re buying five-spice, look for mixes without salt and, if you have an opportunity to give it a whiff, smell for fresh licorice. (Need a brand rec? Cookbook author Andrea Nguyen recommends Spicely Organic Five Spice Seasoning in Vietnamese Food Any Day). Store five-spice powder in an airtight container in a dark, dry place and remember that, like any spice, it has an expiration date: When it starts to lose its smell, it\u2019s time to get a new jar\u2014you have more ribs to make.Got five-spice?
