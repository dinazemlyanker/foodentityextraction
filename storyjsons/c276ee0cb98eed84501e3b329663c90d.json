You probably won\u2019t even miss the alcohol, but if you do, spike each drink with about 1\u00bd oz. vodka or whiskey. And if you can\u2019t get your hands on blood oranges, use orange zest and blood orange juice or a mix of 3 oranges and 1 lemon to mimic the sweet and slightly tangy flavor of blood oranges.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.
