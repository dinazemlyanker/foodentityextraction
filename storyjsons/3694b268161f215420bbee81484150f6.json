Last week they were covered in a pearly white lacquer. I\u2019ve loved doing my nails since I was a teen. But the decade I spent working front of house at fine dining restaurants, casual brunch spots, and specialty bars taught me that food service and manicures don\u2019t mix. While there are completely legit sanitary reasons for food handlers to keep their fingernails short and polish-free, I couldn\u2019t help but feel like the reasons my employers disapproved of my glimmery fingernails often had nothing to do with hygiene.There are unspoken standards in many industries that suggest that brightly colored nails are unprofessional; acrylics mean you\u2019re not ready to work; and a bejeweled manicure implies that you are somehow frivolous and unserious. In the bar and restaurant industry, where female chefs receive fewer accolades and less media attention than their male counterparts and as many as 90% of female restaurant workers experience sexual harassment, \u201chigh femme\u201d is often seen as incongruous with \u201cserious chef.\u201dWith ever-evolving nail polish technology\u2014hello, chip-resistant gel\u2014and also gloves, which exist, it\u2019s high time to reexamine our ideas about professionalism in hospitality. We spoke to some of our favorite chefs, bartenders, and bakers about the power they find in taking care of their nails and the polishes they love the most. For them\u2014and for me\u2014getting a manicure isn\u2019t just a form of artistic expression. It\u2019s a way to practice self care in an industry that demands so much of its workers. \u2014Tiffany HopkinsTiffanie Barriere, mixologist and drinks educator, The Drinking CoachInstagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.I do my nails because I\u2019m basically a hand model. Every time I place that drink down, people are looking at my hands\u2014especially in this digital, photographic, Instagram-centered world we live in. Holding a glass with colorful nails just looks really pretty. With all of the work and washing that my hands endure, I love a picture-perfect manicure.I don\u2019t have hair and I don\u2019t wear makeup and my jewelry is simple, but my nails are always done. They\u2019re a part of my presentation, part of who I am. I grew up that way. My grandmother would take us to get our nails done on our birthdays\u2014she did it for me and all of my cousins, all 19 of us. It was like before you see granny, no matter what else you do, your nails have to be done.I remember years ago if my bosses even allowed us to wear nail polish, they\u2019d still have rules about the colors we could wear. That was so annoying. I love lavender. Lavender lavender lavender! Or an apricot or peach\u2014it\u2019s gotta be nice and light. White also makes me very happy. I\u2019m an OPI girl and always have been, and there\u2019s no changing it. My favorite part of a manicure is at the end when Nancy, my nail tech, applies the tea tree oil to my cuticles, and we both look down and smile because my nails just look so good.Photo courtesy of TargetOPI Do You Lilac It?$10 at Bed Bath & Beyond$10 at TargetJessica Quinn, pastry chef and cocreator of Dacha 46Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.I\u2019ve worked in kitchens for 12 years, and \u201cno nail polish\u201d has always been one of the cardinal rules. So as much as I loved getting manis and pedis, I resigned myself to the fact that it wasn\u2019t going to be a part of my life working in kitchens. Then this last year my wife Trina and I started our own pop-up and I decided that I was bringing my manicures back.I always prided myself on being a serious chef, and there\u2019s an assumption that if you\u2019re a serious chef, you don\u2019t get your nails done. Busted nails gave you street cred. Then I realized how ridiculous that was. I saw a meme recently that said, \u201cThe new model for being a serious chef is to be well-fed, well-slept, and well-hydrated.\u201d I love that. Not taking care of yourself used to be applauded in the food industry, like it meant that you were so dedicated to your craft that looking after yourself took the back seat. Now, instead of being proud of working all those doubles and feeling and looking tired, I hope the new thing is to feel good about glowing and getting enough sleep.When you\u2019re working in kitchens all the time, you\u2019re hot. You\u2019re sweaty. You\u2019re gross. You\u2019re usually covered in food. Looking down at my nails and having a fresh manicure makes me feel fantastic. I love wearing bold colors like hot pink or a bright, in-your-face red. I wear gloves when handling food; I am a serious chef, after all. I take pride in my craft and the food that I make, and I also take pride in my appearance.essie A List$9 $7 at AmazonTara Thomas, chef and cofounder of nonprofit Breaking Bread NYCInstagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.In middle school my dad started taking me to the nail salon with him because he likes getting his nails done. It was something that we did on weekends or after school on a Friday. I\u2019ve loved doing my nails ever since. It\u2019s a form of meditation\u2014no devices, just being present with myself and whoever else is in the room.The food industry is very anti-nails. But I don't really fit into the typical spaces that we find in the industry. Prior to the pandemic I was doing a lot of event production, but I burned out from that and found it hard to be inspired. I've been investing my time in the nonprofit I cofounded called Breaking Bread, which distributes food to vulnerable communities, and my community garden. I like to do my nails myself because if my manicure chips while I\u2019m working in the garden, I can just throw on another coat.I love J. Hannah nail polishes. The colors feel natural and earthy and familiar. I really like the shades Patina, Miso, and Dune. Here in New York, nail art is kind of a scene. A lot of my friends who like to get their nails done are unapologetic about it, regardless of their jobs. It\u2019s a form of self-expression.Photo courtesy of J.Hannah JewelryJ. Hanna Patina$19 at J. HannahDan Pelosi, food and lifestyle creator, GrossyPelosiInstagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.I wear nail polish to talk about what masculinity means. My identity is colorful, it's joyful, it's positive. Doing my nails is an extension of that, and also, because I photograph my hands so much, it\u2019s such a great way to add to the story.In my videos, sometimes I match my nail polish to the cookware or different ingredients in the dish. For one video where I made an Italian sponge cake with berries, I did my nails in this purple hue that was reminiscent of my apron and my hat as well as the berries. A harmonious color story! People pick up on it, which I love.See My Toes is a brand started by a friend of mine who lives in Portland, Oregon. They have really great colors, and it's vegan and cruelty free. We collaborated on a color called Lost in the Sawce, after my vodka sauce recipe. You know the sauce is done when its color matches your fingernails. We did a really limited run, only like 100 bottles or something like that, and it sold out in a weekend.Photo courtesy of See My ToesSee My Toes Wanderlust$18 at CommunionLena Sareini, pastry chef and James Beard Award semifinalistInstagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Having a fresh manicure makes me feel like a bad bitch! Before I started culinary school, I always had my nails done. My sister was really into nail art, and she would give me fun designs. But after I started working in restaurants, my relationship with nail polish really depended on whether my employer allowed it or not, and when they didn\u2019t, it was devastating. I get it\u2014nail polish can chip and get into the food you\u2019re working with. But shellac exists, and it\u2019s basically chip-resistant and lasts a long time, so I wear that.And now that I\u2019m no longer working at a restaurant\u2014I\u2019m just doing the freelance thing with my own pop-ups\u2014I have my nails done all the time, and I love it. I like to wear rings and jewelry, and polished nails really make the whole look come together. There\u2019s also something to be said about going to the salon, too. I do mental health, self-care days when I get a mani, pedi, and a massage. It\u2019s important.Currently, I\u2019m really into doing a clear coat of polish with dried flower petals or gold leaves underneath\u2014that\u2019s actually what I\u2019m wearing right now. I also love to do a different color on each nail, then on my ring finger, I\u2019ll take a ballpoint pen, dip it into nail polish and use it to draw a little flower onto my nail. It\u2019s a super easy trick for doing your own flower designs. I don\u2019t have a favorite nail polish brand, I usually just go by color. I love glitter nail polish\u2014glitter everything!Photo courtesy of Targetessie Summit of Style$9 at Bed Bath & Beyond$9 at TargetHetal Vasada, baker and author of Milk and CardamomInstagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Nail art is an expression of my creativity, but when I started working in commercial kitchens, they were very much like \u201cdon\u2019t wear nail polish.\u201d So there would be this cycle\u2014I\u2019d do my stage, then go get my nails done right after I finished. I\u2019d get to keep it for about a week before my next stage, when I\u2019d take my polish off and begin the cycle again.I\u2019m a baker, and I have baker hands. My fingers are wrinkly and rough from washing dishes and being in hot water. New manicures make me feel fresh, neat, and clean. I do a lot of hands-and-pans videos on Instagram, and I want my hands to look nice. Even when I\u2019m not wearing makeup on my face, I can still hold the food I made, take a picture, and feel a sense of glam.One of my favorite nail artists is Bonnie C. of Skin, Body, Zen in the San Francisco area. Right now, I\u2019m obsessed with short, almond-shaped nails with really abstract art. My designs are always inspired by the season and my mood. In summer, I usually go with bright neon colors, and in fall, I like to do eggplant purples and deep sage-colored greens. My favorite nail product has to be Scratch Nail Wraps by Nina Nailed It. They\u2019re amazing! She has so many cool designs, and they\u2019re easy to use and last forever.Photo courtesy of UltaScratch Lemon Zest Nail Wraps$10 at UltaExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingRestaurantsRecipes you want to make.
