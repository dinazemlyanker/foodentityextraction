Top with scallion greens.Alex LauHow would you rate Buttered Tomatoes with Ginger?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (13)Back to TopTriangleThis was such a nice way to use up some heirloom tomatoes that were on the verge of past prime. I wouldn't have thought of incorporating ginger and soy, but it was a refreshing change of pace from garlic. Silky and deceptively simple, an A+ component to dress up any meal.JulesKauai, HI12/13/2021A staple recipe in our household now. My husband loves this dish and always skips a little when he smells this dish wafting from the kitchen. Sometimes I add bell peppers too if we have some extra. Vy DPortland, OR10/6/2021All the negative reviews make me question how they messed up something simple. If you don\u2019t like ginger then it\u2019s just not for you , it shines through well .\n\nGreat tasting simple snack, I just ate with sourdough toast.KyleLong Beach, CA10/6/2021Garbage total garbage\nSuch a waste of peak tomato!  What were you thinking!!!Steven WChicago8/11/2021SO EASY and quick! A great meal to throw together on weekdays or if your pantry is looking like it is a little barren. It's awesome over short-grain rice. I have also served it with some grilled chicken thighs and really recommend it.AnonymousLos Angeles10/12/2020I can\u2019t stop making this. Great over rice. AnonymousIllinois9/3/2020I had been really looking forward to this, especially after reading the reviews but am super disappointed. I love tomatoes, love ginger, love butter, it smelled incredible...but just ho hum. Not terrible, but not really much of an improvement on good tomatoes with salt on good buttered toastAnonymousChicago9/3/2020This is incredible. We have a garden and LOTS of tomatoes this time of year, so always looking for quick and yummy ways to make them up. This recipe takes maybe 10 minutes including prep. So far served this over sourdough toast, on its own, on crackers, over rice.... favorite combo so far has been over crispy rice and topped with a fried egg \ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24ethompsMinneapolis, Mn8/11/2020Wow... I was a little skeptical of the soy sauce ginger combo with the tomatoes and butter but it was incredible!! We had to make it two nights in a row because it was so good! We poached cod in it and served it over rice which was amazing. If you don't like to use too much butter I think it would still be excellent without it or with just a bit of oil. In the future I'll add slices of eggplant and zucchini or some poached potatoes. Definitely a keeper!California8/10/2020I made a username just to review this recipe because I couldn\u2019t believe there were only 3!\nThis is so good! So easy & flavorful! Such a good recipe to keep in your back pocket for a quick at home lunch over some crusty bread. AnonymousPhiladelphia4/22/2020Very delicious - the soy sauce adds such a great touch, that I never would have thought of! An unexpected twist, mysterious umami flavor that you can\u2019t place unless you were the chef!\n\nI made a couple minor changes:\n-only used dark scallion greens (saut\u00e9ed with the ginger since mine were very pungent)\n-minced the ginger to avoid overpowering very spicy bites\n-next time I will use less butter to make it healthierBoston8/19/2019Loved it! So flavorful! I had it on toast and it was amazing. My dad also made it and he had it over breaded steak. AnonymousArgentina5/8/2019Absolutely delicious!
