Sometimes you will be to blame: You overmixed, you mismeasured, you forgot to set a timer, you baked the cake at too high a temperature for too many minutes (if you\u2019re me, all of the above). Other times, you can fault the recipe\u2014not enough fat, too many dry ingredients without enough wet, a ratio that is just plain off.The good news is that it\u2019s not only possible but easy to salvage a dry cake (maybe you know it\u2019s dry from the way it looks or feels or because you snuck a small bite!) with a little simple syrup. By easy, I mean easy: Poke your loaf cake or layer cake (with a skewer, cake tester, or toothpick), then use a pastry brush to coat it generously with simple syrup, which will soak into the crumb through the channels you just created. That's it: You've successfully completed a \u201ccake soak.\u201dFast-forward to minute 13 to learn all about cake soaks.\nA cake soak is a quick fix for dry cakes, yes, but it also serves to make good cakes even better, guaranteeing that they\u2019re extra moist and extra tender. In Caroline Wright\u2019s book Cake Magic, she suggests brushing syrup into a hot cake, then letting it cool completely in the pan until it\u2019s no longer wet to the touch, 1\u20132 hours. \u201cBy bathing the cake layers in syrup right after they emerge from the oven,\u201d she writes, \u201cyou make double use of the cooling time. While the layers cool, the syrup settles into the cake, changing the crumb and flavor with minimal work on the part of the baker.\u201d She uses \u00bd cup simple syrup between two 8-inch cake layers.When it comes to changing the flavor, the simplest simple syrup won\u2019t do much besides making the cake sweeter and moister. But Wright\u2019s coak soak suggestions go way beyond sugar dissolved in water. By changing up the liquid\u2014try cream, milk, coconut milk, apple cider, brewed tea or coffee, lime or grapefruit juice, root beer\u2014and adding spices, extracts, herbs, and liqueurs, you can enhance the taste of a plain cake.Even if you forgot to add syrup to the cake hot from the oven, if you're making a multi-layered cake you can still apply a cake soak during assembly. For her famous Milk Bar Birthday Cake, Christina Tosi dampens each layer with a mixture of milk and vanilla extract as she stacks them. Claire Saffitz recommends trimming a cake layer first (rather than poking it) so that the syrup can more easily penetrate the interior crumb. In both of these cases, you\u2019ll want to be careful about the amount of soak you use, as it can cause the cakes to oversaturate and disintegrate: Dab the soak over a layer just one time.With this technique in your pocket, you may never have to suffer through a dry cake again. Unless, of course, you\u2019re served a slice at someone else\u2019s house\u2014in that case, just eat it. (Or ask for some whipped cream.)Want a slice?No-Mixer Vanilla Cake With Tangy Cream Cheese FrostingExtremely plush, fine-crumbed, and dare-we-say moist, this is like the best wedding cake\u2014and you mix it entirely by hand.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasically BakingCakeSimple SyrupRecipes you want to make.
