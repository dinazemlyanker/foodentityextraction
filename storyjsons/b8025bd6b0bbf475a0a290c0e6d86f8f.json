Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,Between the holidays and the Feel Good Food Plan, it\u2019s been a minute since we\u2019ve talked. But I\u2019m back now, and I\u2019ve come with some extremely fun news.Okay, I admit it: Even as the Healthyish editor, I sometimes\u2014okay, often\u2014get wellness fatigue. The same two or three names always float to the top of the conversation, and it honestly gets pretty boring. So we decided to dig a little deeper.Today we launched The Healthyish 22, our roster of chefs, artists, entrepreneurs, and all kinds of genre-bending geniuses who are paving the way for a new kind of wellness in 2019.These aren't all people you've seen before. They aren\u2019t celebrities with supplement companies or #influencers shilling products for a living. They don\u2019t have restaurant empires (though Daniela Soto-Innes is well on her way). The Healthyish 22 are hustling, sure. They\u2019re throwing ridiculously fun dinner parties, sourcing the absolute best turmeric, getting wild with mushrooms, and making eye-poppingly good natural wine. They\u2019re making it easier to eat healthyish out in the world and bringing wellness to the communities that need it most. They\u2019re doing it all, but on their own terms\u2014and we want to celebrate that.We also want them to keep doing all the cool things they do. I hope you\u2019ll follow these incredible folks and support their work. You could browse the virtual aisles of Jess Young\u2019s online snack emporium, Bubble Goods, or scope these crazy face mirrors from designer Elise McMahon. I just got one of Steph DeAngelis\u2019s prints framed for my room. You could check out Bini\u2019s Kitchen next time you\u2019re in S.F. or Toli Moli when you\u2019re in D.C.Whatever you do, I hope you find these 22 people as fun, inspiring, and not-boring as I do.Sincerely,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish editorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletteressayRead MoreLifestyleThe Healthyish 22 Are Changing the Way We Eat, Shop, and Live on This Crazy PlanetGallery17 SlidesBy The Healthyish TeamRecipes you want to make.
