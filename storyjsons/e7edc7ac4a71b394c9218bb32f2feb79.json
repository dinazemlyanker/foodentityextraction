We then take things a step further by tossing them in a warm and buttery turmeric honey glaze with lemon and ginger that screams holiday. Remember to shake halfway through cooking for maximum crispiness!All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I tried it out to see if I wanted to add it to my Thanksgiving meal, and the answer was a resounding yes!SunginaOrange County, CA11/16/2021I just made for Dinner tonight. \nThat sauce is OK . but Sprouts are pretty much hard for senior person or people doesn't like hard stuff..\nI recommended before you rare air fryer, I think need to be Boiled or Microwave for Vegetables.\n \n YuriCA11/2/2021I wonder if this would work without an airfryer? maybe as a roasted dish?Toni ReitterAlaska10/27/2021The first bite of these was great, but it quickly became overpowering and sort of vinegary (no idea how, but that's what I was tasting). A lot of work to toss all the leftovers. I wouldn't make them again, but maybe I'm just a sprout purist (butter and salt)alohalifeAustin, tx10/27/2021PLEASE allow a print without the picture, I don't want 2 pageskathrynnew bern nc10/26/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titbrussels sproutGingerHerbs & SpicesTurmerichoneyLemon JuiceSideDinnerVegetarianWeeknightQuickEasyRecipes you want to make.
