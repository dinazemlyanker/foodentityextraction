We went a step further and pur\u00e9ed those juices with the roasted vegetables and softened dried chiles left in the roasting pan, turning the brothy soup into a super-flavorful, spicy dipping sauce. If you are a purist, you can skip the pur\u00e9e, strain the broth, and serve it on the side instead. Start with some guacamole and this pico de gallo recipe and you\u2019re set for the night.Ingredients10\u201312 servingsGoat17\u201310-lb. bone-in leg of goat or lamb, untrimmed\u2153cup Diamond Crystal or 3 Tbsp.

Collecting the ingredients was the hardest step. AnonymousSan Francisco, Ca2/5/2021Great flavor. Used a 5-lb leg of lamb in stovetop pressure cooker for 90 minutes after Browning meat first, then saut\u00e9ing onion / garlic / ginger before adding rest of ingredients and closing the lid. Defatted the sauce before blending, didn\u2019t need to reduce. Made a lot - saving to make a small batch of red enchiladas....  Salsa good also, nice partner to lamb. jsgoboysGrapevine, TX6/30/2020The effort for this is minimal, yet it tastes fantastic! I used a leg of lamb, and when I strained the juices and aromatics, I defatted the drippings, then reduced it by over a half, before pureeing them altogether. This recipe is a keeper, for sure. rlewis3Thurmont MD4/13/2020Don't let goat intimidate you, using a lamb leg was equally delicious and this recipe was incredible! Easier than it seems, it has a long cook time but actually requires little active time or technique. A great way to make tacos for a crowd. Don't skip the pico de gallo. I will be making this again and again. AnonymousChicago, IL4/6/2020I made these for dinner tonight and they turned out so delicious! We did not have any goat or lamb so I made them with some bone in venison. I would 100% make these again and would for sure make with goat once I can get my hands on some, so easy and very tasty. AnonymousRinggold, GA3/28/2020I made this with leg of lamb for a game night with friends. It's a lot of ingredients, but super easy to put together and make. It was seriously one of the most delicious things I have ever cooked.MgubiczaPhiladelphia, PA3/18/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titTacoMexicanLatin AmericanLeg Of LambLambMeatAncho ChileChileVegetableCucumberGoatGuajillo ChileEasyMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreeBraiseDinnerRecipes you want to make.
