It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Turn off the radio, make browniesWhen you find out you need to \u201cbring a simple dessert\u201d four hours before a dinner, you make tahini brownies. I chopped up a Tony\u2019s bar (70%), melted it in the microwave with oil and tahini, and then added it to the stand mixer where I\u2019d whipped up eggs and sugar. And because this recipe is coincidentally gluten-free, you toss in some cornstarch and cocoa powder and call it a batter. Dump into pan, add a plop of sweetened tahini, swirl around with a chopstick, and the fudgy, dense, nutty brownies were done in 26 minutes. A huge hit.Want this letter before it hits the website?

Where\u2019s the room to even slice the cheese?! But Ruby Tandoh \u201csails the salami rivers,\u201d tries a cheese that \u201ctastes like an old country church,\u201d and finds that people express their love through food in many ways. A platter of cheese just happens to be one of them.Read it at Taste: Who Are These Maximalist Cheese Boards For?Photo by Laura Murray, Styling by Allie WistUnnecessary food feud of the weekThis week, Alex Delany highly recommended his favorite soft beverage: Diet Coke. Gasp! Le horror! The Bon App\u00e9tit drinks editor likes a common soda pop?! Our editor in chief likes frozen pizza! A Test Kitchen editor swears by boxed brownie mix! Anyway. People contain multitudes. I used to sit diagonal from Delany and Basically editor Sarah Jampel and we used to cheers our cold cans of Diet Coke like I imagine the knights at the round table did with mead or whatever. Christina Chaey said she\u2019ll drink DC til someone pries it out of her clutches. (bleak, Chaey). Kate Fenologio was once told by a 7-11 employee that she was the reason the soda fountain was always running out of Diet Coke. But others don\u2019t share our passion. Joseph Hernandez and Sasha Levine raised their hands to let me know they\u2019d rather drink [literally anything] than Diet Coke. Emily Schultz is \u201cteam reggo coke.\u201d Bryan Fountain is \u201cmore of a Fanta guy,\u201d and Hilary Cadigan said it gave her a side effect I can\u2019t print here for propriety\u2019s sake. Carla Lalli Music cracks open a DC once a year: \u201cIt\u2019s a very special occasion, the flavor is truly vile\u2014sweet sweet gasoline\u2014but in a wonderfully nostalgic and peaceful way.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecultureI\u2019m the Drinks Editor at BA and, Yes, My Favorite Beverage Is Diet CokeBy Alex Delanyculture17 New Hard Drinks the World Isn\u2019t Ready ForBy Alex BeggscultureThere\u2019s an Entire Industry Dedicated to Making Foods Crispy, and It Is WILDBy Alex BeggscultureI Made BA\u2019s Best Banana Bread and It Was Indeed the BestBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
