(Seriously, that guy makes every movie better. Such range!) If you want to open a buzzy restaurant, you put a katsu sando on the menu. That\u2019s just how things work, and we couldn\u2019t be happier.But let\u2019s back up a bit, in case you haven\u2019t spent the past year meticulously scanning menus of new restaurants, line by line, like us. What exactly is a katsu sando? \u201cKatsu\u201d is shorthand for \u201ckatsuretsu,\u201d which means \u201ccutlet\u201d in Japanese, and \u201csando\u201d is just the adorable nickname Japanese people gave the word \u201csandwich.\u201d Essentially, it is Japan\u2019s answer to the bologna sandwich. Let me explain. The Japanese have a strange fascination with Western food, which is why you\u2019ll find amazing Neapolitan pizzas and hamburgers there. There\u2019s even a word for it, yoshoku\u2014it\u2019s a whole subset of cuisine in Japan! But back to the katsu sando. So legend (a.ka. the Internet) has it that the sandwich first appeared at a restaurant called Rengatei in Tokyo back in 1899 as a sort of homage to schnitzel. Apparently, people really like it because it\u2019s survived this long\u2014and even made its way to the U.S.The katsu sando is a simple thing: two slices of cotton-like shokupan (Japanese milk bread), slathered with zingy tonkatsu sauce (a thick, A1-like sauce), bookending a thick cutlet of meat (typically pork but nowadays a lot of wagyu) that\u2019s been lightly breaded and fried. Sometimes there\u2019s a little raw cabbage salad on the side (or even stuffed into the sandwich itself). There is nothing sweeter than biting into a freshly made katsu sando (well, maybe except for my dad\u2019s speech at my wedding; you had to be there). The all-panko breading makes each square inch of the cutlet super crunchy. The tonkatsu sauce cuts through the richness of the cutlet and lends some depth (and a little moisture so it\u2019s not a sad, dry sandwich). The shokupan protects the roof of your mouth from hot meat and rough breading (baguettes can\u2019t do that!). It all adds up to a dish that looks as harmless and dainty as a tea sandwich but delivers all the intense meaty joy of a French dip. No wonder it\u2019s showing up in restaurants across the country.At Ferris in New York City, a well-marbled cut of Ib\u00e9rico gets the katsu treatment, while at Momonoki in Atlanta, you can katsu anything for your sando, from steak to chicken. A more classic version, with the usual pork cutlet, weaves its way through more menus, from Alley Cat in Austin to Adana in Seattle to Pagu in Cambridge, MA. Is it a trend? Sure. But what\u2019s more exciting is that this humble sandwich, once just a Japanese convenience store standby, is getting its due.\u201cYou have the crispy pork, the soft bread, the sweet tonkatsu sauce, and the bright cabbage, it\u2019s balanced,\u201d says Keisuke Akabori, the chef at Stonemill Matcha in San Francisco.He fries up tender Duroc pork coated in two types of breading, and plans to start making his own milk bread in the future (local fixture Andersen Bakery subs in the meantime). He makes his own tonkatsu sauce\u2014thick, tangy, slightly spicy, and sweet, thanks to prunes (fun fact!). For the Saison vet, it\u2019s not just making a sandwich\u2014it\u2019s all about perfecting it.Read more about the 25 restaurant trends we saw in 2018Now make the crispiest chicken cutlet sando.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHot 10 2018The Hot 10SandwichPorkJapaneseRead MorecookingThe Chicken Katsu Recipe Every Kid (and Adult) Will LoveBy Adam RapoportcookingHomemade Teriyaki Sauce Is a Million Times BetterBy Alex DelanycookingPanko Is the Best Thing to Buy at the Grocery StoreBy Alex DelanyRecipes you want to make.
