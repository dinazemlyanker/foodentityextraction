Allen/Short Stack PressFacebookTwitterEmailThese roasted, caramelized bananas in Tia Keenan\u2019s new Short Stack cookbook dedicated to just one ingredient\u2014Ch\u00e8vre\u2014caught our hungry eyes. They\u2019re topped with ch\u00e8vre yogurt and toasted pecans and we had to have the recipe. Below, Tia explains the inspiration behind the decadent breakfast and why she\u2019s ch\u00e8vre\u2019s No. 1 fan.Ch\u00e8vre was one of my first forays into the world of \u201cfancy cheese\u201d. It was French, it was fresh and it was as frisky as the goats whose milk made it possible. Ch\u00e8vre was alive! It was tangy, grassy, citrusy, and bright, and I was smitten at first bite.In the process of making Ch\u00e8vre, I came to appreciate that my kindred feelings about ch\u00e8vre\u2014besides the playful, anarchistic joie de vivre that I share with goats\u2014are that it\u2019s more than a cheese to me; it\u2019s an attitude, a perkiness with a side of reinvention.Ch\u00e8vre is dense and creamy, a rare textural combination for a fresh cheese (for comparison, consider the soppiness of whole-milk ricotta or the curdy crumble of farmer cheese). Because it\u2019s compact, it \u201cloosens\u201d with the addition of milk, cream, yogurt or other liquids without losing its creaminess, which is how the ch\u00e8vre yogurt (sweetened with honey) in this recipe for roasted bananas works. And unlike other cheeses, ch\u00e8vre doesn\u2019t melt so much as meld. It\u2019s for painting broad strokes with acidity and fat and for depositing pockets of it, as soft and inviting as a new set of bedsheets.The recipe for roasted bananas came from a dream: I\u2019d live in a rickety old house that I could fill with interesting, eclectic houseguests\u2014the kind of folks who\u2019d need a place to crash while they finished a revolutionary novel or required some R&R after pursuing an improbable international romance. Now that I\u2019ve acquired said dream house, memorable breakfasts are how I ensure a steady flow of houseguests throughout the year (few adults ever have a home-cooked breakfast made for them, so it\u2019s proven to be a truly enticing amenity). Breakfast cheese seals the deal.Lauren V. Allen/Short Stack PressRoasted Bananas with Ch\u00e8vre Yogurt & Toasted PecansFrom 1 lime, grate 1 teaspoon of zest and squeeze 1 tablespoon of juice1 teaspoon dark rum1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract1 teaspoon ground cinnamon2 tablespoons dark brown sugarPinch of kosher salt4 bananas, halved lengthwise with the peel on4 ounces ch\u00e8vre, at room temperature1 cup goat\u2019s milk yogurt, divided1 teaspoon honey\u00bd cup roughly chopped toasted pecansSERVES 4Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0. In a small bowl, whisk together the lime juice, rum, vanilla, cinnamon, sugar and salt.Nestle the banana halves peel side down in a 9-by-13-inch glass baking dish and brush their flesh with the lime juice mixture. Bake for 15 minutes, until they\u2019re soft and just starting to brown. Increase the oven temperature to broil and continue roasting the bananas for 5 more minutes, until they\u2019re slightly caramelized.Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, use an electric mixer at medium speed to beat the ch\u00e8vre with a \u00bc cup of yogurt, the honey, and lime zest until the mixture is smooth and airy. Fold the remaining \u00be cup of yogurt in by hand and set aside.Using a spatula, carefully transfer the bananas from the baking dish to a serving platter (they will be quite limp, so move slowly), spoon the yogurt over them, sprinkle with the pecans and serve immediately.Buy it: Ch\u00e8vre by Tia Keenan, $13 on AmazonExcerpted from Ch\u00e8vre by Tia Keenan.

As a result, there are a lot of harder, aged cheeses in this category, with the exception of Dancing Fern right below.Explore Bon App\u00e9titBananaGoat CheeseCookbooksDessertCheeseRecipes you want to make.
