Slow-stirred and velvety? delicious. A few seconds in a ripping hot skillet? Love \u2018em. Oozing with smoked salmon and dill? Gimme. Even the most over-cooked, rubbery, diner eggs are somehow comforting when you\u2019re hungover at 11 a.m. But dinner scrambled eggs? Not my thing.Or so I thought. The person who changed my mind was none other than Chris Morocco, which shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone. He\u2019s changed millions of minds (Ed note: This is an estimate) about broccoli, tofu, eggplant and more. But this particular recipe is, I think, his biggest coup: dinner scrambled eggs\u2014no breakfast vibes allowed.He does it with a triple-threat of ingredients\u2014grated ginger, mirin, and soy sauce\u2014which get added to the raw eggs. Then he cooks the eggs in ghee (though unsalted butter works too) at a medium-low temp until they\u2019re barely set. And...that\u2019s it. Wow, scrambled eggs are easy.You might not taste each of the added ingredients on their own, but together they lend subtle sweetness and umami to an already unimpeachable food. It\u2019s like when someone shows up at the party looking better than they used to but you can\u2019t quite put your finger on why. New haircut? Trimmed beard? Whatever it is, they look good. And dinner-appropriate, I might add.Morocco\u2019s dinner scramble recipe calls for quick pickles and rice, which, sure, sign me up, but I\u2019m just as likely to eat these eggs over wilted greens or over fried bread. And despite Morocco\u2019s dinner agenda, I\u2019ll happily eat them for breakfast too.Get the recipe:Soy-Ginger Dinner ScrambleGinger and soy sauce make scrambled eggs for dinner feel like more than a cop-out.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titNever FailRecipes you want to make.
