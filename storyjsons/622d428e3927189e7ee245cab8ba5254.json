But what are the costs of doing what you love for a living?By Ali FrancisFebruary 8, 2022FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Hazel ZavalaFacebookTwitterEmailAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Oh, my god! Oh, my god!\u2019\u201d The Michelin-trained restaurant chef turned TikTok star is describing the moment U.K.-based publishing house Bloomsbury asked her to write a cookbook proposal in September 2020. \u201cIt was like, What on earth is happening?\u201dLike many restaurant workers in the pandemic, O\u2019Toole was furloughed in March 2020 and eventually lost her job as a junior sous-chef at the members-only social club, the AllBright. \u201cI felt completely helpless,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to do anything but cook.\u201d That\u2019s when her 10-year-old sister introduced her to TikTok. \u201cI started scrolling through it and a recipe video came up,\u201d she says. \u201cI was like, I reckon I could do that.\u201d O\u2019Toole made daily videos showing her followers what a chef \u201cwho is unemployed, hungry, and trying to be healthy\u201d eats in a day.Today, she has 2 million TikTok followers and counting. Her cookbook, Poppy Cooks, landed on shelves last September\u2014by which time she was earning more money than she ever had in restaurants.Poppy Cooks: The Food You Need$26 at AmazonMany laid-off cooks and hospitality workers like O\u2019Toole have suddenly had space to consider the realities of their work: low, stagnant pay. Wild schedules. Exhausting duties. And rude customers. After enough reflection, many of them have decided not to return to their past roles. Meanwhile, \u201cHELP WANTED\u201d signs are peppering restaurant windows all over the country as other hospitality workers are leaving their jobs at the highest rate in decades.I am trying to avoid a Benjamin Franklin turned Biz Bro aphorism like, \u201cout of adversity comes opportunity.\u201d But it does seem particularly apt here. Since March 2020, pop-ups have sprouted across the country, ghost kitchens have boomed, and unemployed food workers have started successful doughnut empires. This year, in what\u2019s being termed the Great Resignation, more and more employees are quitting jobs they hate to do something they don\u2019t.\u00a0But there are plenty of costs associated with doing what you love. Americans have long idealized the side-hustle economy\u2014The Dream\u2122\u2014yet entrepreneurial burnout and the fatigue that\u2019s unique to restaurant work can look a lot alike. I spoke with O\u2019Toole\u2014and other chefs who recently left their gigs to pursue their passions\u2014to find out: Is it worth it?Work-life boundaries are hard to define, but being your own boss is empowering.Bronwen Wyatt was working up to 14 hours a day as pastry chef at both The Elysian Bar and Bacchanal Wines in New Orleans when she was laid off during the summer of 2020. Before she was let go, Wyatt noticed the large-format cakes and desserts on Elysian\u2019s to-go menus were selling well. \u201cI had a couple of people reach out [after I left], asking if they could still buy cakes from me,\u201d she remembers, which prompted her to start Bayou Saint Cake, her NOLA-based \u201ctiny bakery\u201d soon afterward. There was no business plan, Wyatt says, but \u201cthe orders kept rolling in.\u201dThese days, she makes 25 to 30 cakes per week\u2014all whimsical, flower-crowned masterpieces. Wyatt loves her newfound autonomy and the creative freedom that comes with doing your own thing. Not having to be at work by 5 a.m. anymore has also improved her relationship with her wife. \u201cNow we wake up at the same time and go to bed at the same time, and that\u2019s been huge,\u201d she says.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.But even outside the all-too-demanding schedule of the restaurant industry, the toll of working can quickly add up. As a former entrepreneur myself, I know firsthand that nobody is going to set work-life boundaries for you\u2014and doing so feels almost Sisyphean when you\u2019re just trying to keep that boulder rolling. \u201cI need to not work as much, because it\u2019s reproducing a toxic framework from the restaurant industry,\u201d Wyatt admits. \u201cThere\u2019s this \u2018feast or famine\u2019 feeling, where I worry that if I don\u2019t accept as many orders as possible now, that this will eventually fade away and I\u2019ll regret [not doing more].\u201d She has found ways to free up some time by using menu apps like Minimart to automate the ordering process.The outpouring of love for Wyatt\u2019s cakes keeps her going. \u201cPeople DM me from all over the country and world to tell me how much pleasure they get looking at pictures of [them],\u201d she says. \u201cIt still blows my mind.\u201dFor a greater financial payoff, you might need to make sacrifices from the start.In February 2020, Rashida Holmes quit all of her restaurant gigs to fully run Bridgetown Roti, a Caribbean pop-up in Downtown L.A., selling a rotating menu of fish cakes, macaroni pie, roti, and more. Then the pandemic hit, and Holmes had to rethink what was possible. \u201cI saw a friend of mine selling meal kits out of her house in April,\u201d she tells me over the phone. \u201cAnd I was like, Oh, I think I can probably sell patties [from home].\u201d She began to make her version of the mouthwatering, half-moon-shaped golden pastries\u2014filled with anything from oxtails to Trini eggplant\u2014that are popular in Barbados, where her mom was born.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.After advertising the patties on Instagram, she \u201csold out in the first weekend, and the next one, and then it just kept growing and growing,\u201d Holmes says, highlighting the importance of testing the market in a low-risk, low-capital way\u2014like selling food online before committing to a physical space. Now, she\u2019s had enough success to start cooking and serving food out of a commissary kitchen and hire a staff of six, mostly part-timers. But she\u2019s still not making a salary, choosing instead to \u201cinvest everything back into the business and our people.\u201d It\u2019s not uncommon that founders are often \u201cthe last ones to take a paycheck,\u201d Holmes says, noting that she has the privilege of some financial support. \u201cMy wife\u2019s kind of being my sugar mama right now\u2014as much as a public educator can be.\u201dListen to Holmes on Our Podcast: Food PeopleContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Despite the very real financial strain, she\u2019s proud she can pay her employees properly and ensure no one on staff is relying on tips or working crazy hours like they might at a traditional restaurant. \u201cI definitely feel a lot of pressure to make it work, but I also know this is the direction I want to go in,\u201d Holmes says. \u201cI see myself getting paid from this in the future, for sure. Right now I gotta make sacrifices; that\u2019s kind of the entrepreneurial journey.\u201dThe pressure to succeed is all on you, but it could exceed your wildest expectations.\u201cWhat you don\u2019t know is that there\u2019s so much more to it than meets the eye,\u201d O\u2019Toole says, describing her day-to-day work life. \u201cYou have to be your own timekeeper, boss, scheduler. You have to be writing, creating, and videoing content.\u201d In other words, you have to do it all.While running my own food business, I was best at recipe development and creative work, but that was often the last thing on my to-do list, after fundraising, marketing, supply chain management, and the constant cost calculations that ran through my head. And, unlike a job you can leave at the door regardless of a bad day or week, O\u2019Toole says she finds the constant pressure to perform overwhelming at times. \u201cI had a period of time when I was like, I don\u2019t know if this is for me,\u201d she remembers. \u201cPutting yourself out there [in the public eye], open for criticism, is quite daunting sometimes.\u201dTikTok contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Still, looking back to early 2020, when she was considering going on unemployment benefits, O\u2019Toole is proud of how far she\u2019s come. \u201cI always had an idea that I\u2019d be working [for someone else] until I was 40-something and then I\u2019d want to open my own place,\u201d she says. \u201cA cookbook would\u2019ve been great but I was thinking it probably would have been a lot longer down the line\u2014not at 27.\u201d Similarly, Wyatt had many career aspirations (like being featured in Bon App\u00e9tit!) that didn\u2019t come to being until she started her own thing. \u201cI just think it\u2019s one of the strangest things that\u2019s come out of the pandemic,\u201d she says. \u201cI was able to meet a lot of these personal goals for myself without any support around it; that\u2019s not lost on me.\u201dAfter a surge in new businesses during 2020 and 2021, we still don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to them this year\u2014as more and more employment opportunities bounce back and some start-ups inevitably fail. But I was deeply struck by the single, clear resolution every entrepreneur I spoke with agreed on: None of them are planning to return to their restaurant gigs anytime soon. \u201cWhy would I?\u201d O\u2019Toole asks. \u201cI\u2019ve managed to make a successful company for myself and I get to keep the profits.\u201dThe pandemic, for all its challenges, has given folks the time and headspace to consider the realities of the hospitality industry, and to decide when, and how, they want to participate going forward. And it\u2019s given the oft-overlooked worker a voice. \u201cI felt confident in my cooking for the first time,\u201d Holmes says. \u201c[Because] I was telling my own story for the first time.\u201dThinking of starting a food business?
