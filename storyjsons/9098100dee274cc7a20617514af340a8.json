The gelato at Superiority Burger. The tagliatelle al ragu at Al Di La. The prawn pad thai at Uncle Boons Sister. And, as of late, the salad at Ops Pizza in Bushwick.There is only one salad offered at Ops. On the menu it\u2019s called \u201csalad.\u201d It costs twelve dollars, it feeds a crowd, and it changes all the time. And no matter what, it\u2019s always going to be one of the best salads you\u2019ve ever had. I want to quickly acknowledge that Ops\u2019 pizza is truly exceptional and worth the trip alone. But what always seems to stick with me are the greens.On a recent visit, I had a little gem and cherry tomato salad with a creamy vinaigrette tangled with herbs that tasted like what you always hope ranch dressing will be like. It was as if every piece of lettuce had been hand selected for crunch, and, married with all the other ingredients, the tomatoes popped with sweetness like some kind of plant candy. It was such an elegant, balanced assemblage of vegetables, I almost forgot we had pizza coming.Ops co-owner Marie Tribouilloy sits with a red endive and gem lettuce salad.\nPhoto by Chelsea KyleA friend who ordered the salad on a separate occasion got a plate of greens and radishes dressed in a sauce of thinned ricotta, olive oil, honey, homemade mayo, and chives, while another friend got radicchio with tomatoes, cucumbers, and sesame vinaigrette. Ops is Beyonc\u00e9 when it comes to salads: incapable of producing anything other than a hit.How do they make this salad magic?!I asked co-owner Marie Tribouilloy, a France native and the genius behind the greens. \u201cI think that is just what I wanted to eat,\u201d she says about why she put the salad on the menu. \u201cIf you are going to stuff yourself with pizza it\u2019s really good, but it is also bread and cheese. You want something full of water and crunchy and really bright.\u201d She walked me through her flexible formula for making the perfect salads at Ops. Fair warning: Knowing how to make this salad at home won\u2019t make you crave it any less.Choose a sturdy base.Tribouilloy\u2019s go-to base for her salads is radicchio, as \u201cit has these hearty, beautiful, large leaves, and it is something you need to chew on to get the flavor out of,\u201d she says. On a more practical note, \u201cI want people to be able to eat the salad with their hands, like a fun snack,\u201d she says, and radicchio fits the bill.She also loves little gems and Treviso\u2014the common thread here is sturdiness. You want a base green that will hold up well, she says, and not wilt when soaked with dressing.Go bitter, sweet, and saltyEven before considering dressing, Tribouilloy\u2019s trick to a perfectly balanced salad is a trio of bitter, sweet, and salty components in the salad itself. Radicchio, corn, olives; little gems, slightly roasted tomatoes, ricotta; radicchio, plums, gomasio (more on this soon). You get the idea.An Ops salad with Gem lettuce, smoked corn kernels, radish, and homemade gomasio.\nPhoto by Chelsea KyleInclude a slightly cooked elementWhether it\u2019s blistered sun-gold tomatoes, fried onions, or slightly burnt olives, Tribouilloy likes to include some kind of barely cooked element in her salads, both for texture and also because they often play double-duty when satisfying the bitter/sweet/salty formula above. For example, blistered sun-gold tomatoes are both bitter and sweet, and slightly burnt olives are bitter and salty.Put! Herbs! In! Your! Dressing!Dressing is Tribouilloy\u2019s favorite element of a salad. \u201cI like a pool of liquid at the bottom of the plate\u201d that you can sop up with pizza crust, she says. \u201cI want a dressing that is opulent, in a way.\u201dHer dressing secret is fresh herbs, so she\u2019ll add whatever she has on hand at the restaurant. They keep the dressing fresh, add another dimension of flavor, and cut through any rich components like ricotta or mayo.Double up on acidTo give her salads their tangy depths, Tribouilloy typically adds a sour element not once, but twice. To the dressing, she\u2019ll include some kind of vinegar (she makes her own using wines at the restaurant that have gone bad) or saba (made by cooking grape musts) (an aged vinegar), but never lemon. She says that lemon doesn\u2019t belong in dressings, \u201cbecause it is only good if I can squeeze it fresh.\u201d Instead, after the salad is assembled, she finishes it with a squeeze of lemon, which she says makes for the brightest, most vibrant taste.Meet gomasio: your new favorite salty salad topperSure, you could top your salad with cheese and call it a day. But Tribouilloy loves using gomasio, a dry condiment made by mashing sesame seeds and salt that essentially serves as a dairy-free substitute for a sprinkle of cheese. \u201cIt\u2019s this beautiful, super nutty powder,\u201d she says. \u201cYou just put a little on and it gives it this accent. You get this first impression of nuttiness just before the salad reveals the flavor of the greens. I love that.\u201dThree Ops salad combinations to try at home:#1.
