Sweet and smoky roasted carrots are blended with chickpeas, almonds, lemon juice, garlic, and herbs. It\u2019s the perfect companion to seeded crackers or good bread.

Will make again, for sure!AnonymousMichigan2/11/2022Wonderful recipe!! I made this for parties, my friends took home whatever was left over!LE RubinLos Angeles11/17/2021Delish! Used Tahini instead of the almonds so used less evoo. I added lemon zest & more lemon juice than called for as it needed a bit more acid to balance...1.5 cloves garlic (still a bit too much raw garlic taste for me)...I should\u2019ve added some cold water to smooth out & loosen a but more but all & all really really good. The smoked paprika is a must as it really compliments the sweetness of the carrots. I added some crushed red pepper for a bit of spice since my smoked par prima was not hot. \nServed with mini cukes wedges & Mary gone crackers super seeds. Tu2Hammond, IN5/30/2021Delicious!! Used an extra clove of garlic, raw cashews and almonds (because I ran out of almonds), a healthy handful of parsley, a bit of extra paprika. Next time I would add some water to thin versus the extra olive oil. It was smooth and delicious - a huge hit!CatherineLake Orion, Michigan5/28/2021Oh my gosh this was amazing!!! Thank you. I added more water and used a blender, dip was a little chunky. I added an extra clove of garlic but followed recipe as stated. We had it with toasted nan and soup. Would be delicious with an assortment of veggies- a crowd pleaser for sure... can't wait to serve it to friends or family.JennyNew Castle, DE2/2/2021I am surprised by all of the good reviews here. This one came out alright but was not easy to make. It was incredibly dry and I had to add significantly more oil than a 1/2 cup. The sweetness of the carrots did not blend well with the smoked paprika. A few people I served this to were pleased but I would only make again with modifications. Anonymous12/27/2020Has anyone use a blender for this opposed to food processor?AnonymousChicago, IL12/24/2020With a few tweaks it was WONDERFUL.  I had to add another full can of chickpeas, more garlic, more lemon juice and more olive oil as the recipe was far too salty for me and my family.  Next time, I will cut the salt in half...but I'll still add more garlic, it's so good :)  Tiffany FMalibu, CA12/22/2020Made this dip to bring to friends with \"seedy oat crackers\" and it was a big hit.  Came out very smooth in the vitamix.AnonymousVancouver BC10/14/2020Delicious! Perfect to use up the carrots I got in my CSA. I used celery greens (also CSA) in place of the parsley with success. Great alternative to hummus.sarahbear518Seattle, WA7/31/2020Someone asked about subbing for almonds - I only had pine nuts so used these instead. I think it actually came out better than when I made with the almonds (texture was less coarse this go round). I also almost tripled the garlic and upped the paprika 25%. SO GOOD CAN'T STOP EATING IT. Favorite way to eat it so far is spread on toasted sourdough and topped with a fried egg and everything bagel seasoning. AnonymousHouston, TX4/20/2020Holy crap this is good! \n\nI needed to use up carrots that were languishing in my crisper. I didn\u2019t have parsley so I used cilantro, didn\u2019t have whole almonds so I toasted some ground ones although I imagine pistachios would be fine. Now I need to decide what I am having it with. AnonymousCanada4/19/2020Question:  Has anyone tried to substitute another nut for almonds or altered in any way?\nAnonymousColumbus Ohio4/13/2020Because I bought 2 five pound bag of carrots, I decided to try this. It's a WINNER!!! I love it warm and could eat it right out of the food processor. So good! I made 2 other dips and this one was the winner. \nwinelover813Los Angeles4/9/2020This dip is amazing and wonderfully versatile. I'm (thankfully) on day 3 of leftovers and just had a little lunch burrito with this dip, some other raw veggies and chalula hot sauce. so good - will definitely be making this again.
