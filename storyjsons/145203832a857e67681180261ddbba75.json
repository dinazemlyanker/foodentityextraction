Up next, a guide to building a joy toolbox to give yourself a midwinter boost. Read on, but don\u2019t forget to check out her winter playlist too.This was one long, hellish year with some highs, yes, but also some very painful lows. I don\u2019t consider myself religious, but truly there were some moments when I had to just stop, lie down, play Marvin Sapp\u2019s \u201cNever Would\u2019ve Made It,\u201d and just breathe. There\u2019s been a lot to process: the 2020 election season; an unprecedented worldwide pandemic; George Floyd\u2019s murder and the global centuries-long abuse of Black people igniting uprisings across the nation, followed by the countless performative gestures that dodged any real heavy lifting and postured as meaningful solidarity. Like I said, it\u2019s been a looong year.Winter is around the corner and with heightened feelings of meh accompanying the seasonal change, I\u2019ve been thinking about joy toolboxes and how helpful it is to have a go-to stock of activities and practices that make you feel good. There are so many heartaches, tragedies, and fucked-up normalities that can unexpectedly knock the wind out of us. So many plot twists in life that nudge us to reevaluate and reimagine what we understand as self-care. While there\u2019s obviously no one-size-fits-all quick fix for tough times or feeling blue, and the short-lived thrill of buying something that comes and goes, I do think it\u2019s worthwhile to find ways to add more joy and tranquility into the day-to-day. From soothing lighting that puts me in my zone to perspective shifts that have helped me embrace the fluidity of life more, here are five things in my wellness toolbox that may inspire your own.Go on a new food adventureWith the food industry still in dire need of support and the same monotonous routine filling many of our quarantine days, now is an especially good time to treat ourselves to takeout from that restaurant or cool new pop-up bookmarked on our Instagrams. You know, the one that evoked an \u201cI\u2019ve gotta try that!\u201d as soon as it crossed your feed. This was exactly the case when I came across Jamaican chef, model, creative technopreneur, and multimedia storyteller Jazzy Harvey serving a revolving menu of Jamaican fusion takeout in Los Angeles\u2019s Crenshaw District. The Anjahles Jamaican x LA Fusion founder and head chef\u2019s current menu offers a remixed selection of Caribbean classics: oxtail mac \u2019n\u2019 cheese, vegan jerk gumbo, candied \u201cdark and lovely\u201d plantain.Beyond a highly Instagrammable good meal, it feels great to support a small business that prioritizes community and is intentional about giving back, like bringing music and 300-plus free meals to Leimert Park alongside chef Hugh Augustine, chef Marcus Yaw, chef James B, and DJ Coly Cole for a Community Friendsgiving last month. Regardless of where you live, take this winter as an opportunity to make a mini mission around intentionally supporting food businesses, and if you\u2019re around the Crenshaw neighborhood or L.A. County, add Anjahles to your list (and stay tuned for its upcoming pop-ups around the city and holiday catering menu).Commit to making your space a happy placeMaking your space feel like a cozy slice of paradise goes a long way toward combating winter blues. For me, that looks like regularly having fresh flowers around the house, treating myself to fun glassware that gets me daydreaming about post-quarantine get-togethers, and always having candles on deck. Whether I\u2019m relaxing or working, being in a setting with dim lighting coming only from the glow of candles sets the perfect mood. My current favorites are the coconut shell soy candles from Isle of Wax, a candle line launched by Saint Lucia native Danielle Privat to celebrate smells of the Caribbean that I discovered on @blackownedeverything, an Instagram highlighting Black-owned businesses created by stylist Zerina Akers. The Saint Lucia candle filled my room with the most amazing fruity-meets-fresh-laundry smell before even being lit. Opening my package\u2014filled with a flurry of sweet scents, vibrant blue stuffing, and a thoughtful handwritten note\u2014felt like Christmas.Have your therapy/wellness resources up-to-dateFinding a new therapist\u2014or other wellness support\u2014can be such a daunting experience, and if you\u2019re seeking a care provider who shares certain identity intersections with you, like also being a Black woman and/or trans, multiply that by 1,000. I find it super helpful to have a few go-to directories in the toolbox to make the search less of a headache when the need arises. Here are some resources to start with: Queer Healers, whose directory of queer practitioners include herbalists, tarot readers, astrologists, sex therapists, birth/abortion/death doulas, and more. Therapy for Black Girls focuses on connecting Black women with local Black women therapists, and also offers a wellness blog and a mental health podcast led by psychologist, speaker, and founder Dr. Joy Harden Bradford. Black Female Therapists offers a directory of Black women therapists, including a listing of the type of care they specialize in (e.g., anxiety, depression, body image, LGBTQIA+ identity), a podcast, and a mental health blog. You can also check out six other mental health resources offering virtual support to Black people\u2014and I\u2019m adding Lauryn Hill\u2019s live album Lauryn Hill Unplugged No. 2.0 because no one can tell me listening to it in the car doesn\u2019t have special healing properties.Try a new type of weed (if you\u2019re into that)In hindsight, chilling in bed on my phone after trying Canndescent\u2019s \u201ccharge\u201d joint feels like a missed opportunity considering how much of an enjoyable body/mind high it provided. Maybe I should\u2019ve had a station ready with snacks, coloring books, art activities, and tender/funny videos? My thoughts once the high started to wane were basically, Wow, well, I guess I\u2019m going to have to be a grown-up and start investing in quality weed now. It was easily the best high I\u2019ve experienced from a pre-rolled joint. Canndescent offers (limited-edition) holiday joints too! If you\u2019re looking to broaden your weed toolbox, consider trying out Papa & Barkley\u2019s THC body oil for pain and tension relief. And if exploring vaginal cannabis products is of interest, Quim\u2019s everyday CBD (or THC) oil can be used for everything from menstruation relief to post-shower TLC.Embrace optimism and uncertainty as an act of wellnessLately, I\u2019ve been opening up more to the idea that positive occurrences and opportunities, as well as the roads leading to them, may not manifest in the way I envisioned in my head\u2014and maybe that\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve also decided to give leaning into positive what-ifs a go. What if this isn\u2019t working out because I\u2019m being redirected to something that\u2019s more aligned with who I am and what I want? What if there\u2019s no need to chase or frantically grasp and that certain roadblocks are blessings in disguise? What if the right things, the right people, and all of the good shit will flow into your life, and the task isn\u2019t to chase or mourn or be swallowed up by shame, but rather to learn, explore, heal, and evolve into the best most you version of yourself? What if \u201call of the good shit\u201d looks nothing like you ever imagined? What if it\u2019s going to be okay, even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it, even if you can\u2019t see or feel that light at the end of the tunnel right now? If you believed that, what would you do next? That\u2019s the space I\u2019ve been exploring lately, and it\u2019s a refreshing change of pace.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHere We AreHealthyishSelf CareessayRead MoreLifestyleRapper Hugh Augustine\u2019s Vegan Food Is a Love Letter to His L.A.
