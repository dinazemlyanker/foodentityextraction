That doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. Probably shouldn't be labeled as vegan. Anonymous3/3/2021Can't believe this was listed under Vegan Recipes! \n\nNo need to kill anyone to please your appetite.Perrygirl2/20/2021this recipes valid i love slow cooked carrots that get charred after. but like what\u2019s up with this weird flavor profile of daikon and pomegranate? the vinaigrette of anchovy and pom juice isn\u2019t bad it just doesn\u2019t harmonize with the classic confit you\u2019re doing with the carrots here. i\u2019d alter it a bit to kind of land on some sort of path \u2014> za\u2019atar instead of thyme during the braise, and maybe sumac and some pomegranate molasses instead of whole seeds in the vinaegrette? think about this a bit jane duhnew yowkkk2/12/2021I changed the method quite a lot for these, because it screams of restaurant instead of home kitchen (I mean, a cup and a half of carrot oil? Are you serious?). The flavor was five stars for sure.\n\nI peeled and cut my carrots on the bias, tossed them with olive oil, S&P, thyme and garlic powder (minced garlic would burn). Covered a sheet pan in foil (I don't normally use aluminum but do you want blackened or don't you?) and roasted them in a single layer for 40 minutes at 400\u00b0. Meanwhile slice the radish and make the dressing and once the carrots are out of the oven you're good to go.SarahFowlerWolfeSacramento, CA4/23/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titDaikonVegetableCarrotPomegranateFruitWinterSideGluten-FreeDairy-FreeNut-FreeHealthyishRosh HashanahDinnerRecipes you want to make.
