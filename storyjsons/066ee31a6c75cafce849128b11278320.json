Except Me.Who decided an economy-crushing, emotionally trying pandemic was a good time for self-improvement?By Josh DuboffApril 23, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailI have never, to put it mildly, been one to cook. A New Yorker in the Carrie Bradshaw \u201cMy oven? You mean where I store my sweaters?\u201d vein, I cannot remember the last time I made something more complicated than a mixed drink in my kitchen. Once, seven or eight years ago, my friend David came over to try and teach me how to make a \u201csimple\u201d dish: a chicken-based stew. While we prepped, the oddly intricate salt-and-pepper shaker fell apart into the pot. We thought we had removed all the components, but when I was ladling the leftovers into a container after we finished eating, I found a \u2026 triple-A battery in the remains. As I tried to process the fact that we had just ingested a battery-flavored stew, the battery itself seemed to taunt me: You are not meant for this.Now, during this quarantine period, I am taunted by banana bread. Each Instagram Story of a well-lit sourdough loaf or glistening roast chicken or complex soup presents a new spiral of envy and shame. They have been impossible to avoid this past month, this deeply strange stretch of time where each day seems to last a year, no matter how late you sleep in.Wherever I scroll, close friends, acquaintances I haven\u2019t seen in 11 years (but still monitor assiduously on social media), celebrities\u2014they\u2019re all sharing their culinary outputs. One college classmate has posted a new homemade dessert every night: \u201cWhipped these up!\u201d he\u2019ll write, as if he reached into his pocket and emerged with this set of 12 elegantly shaped almond macaroons. I watch influencers and reality-show contestants present braided artisanal breads (\u201cmade from scratch!!\u201d) instead of their usual sponsored teeth-whitening and gym equipment posts. Kylie Jenner recently shared her banana pancake process on Instagram, step by step, and\u2014even in that case\u2014it looked to me like an impossible feat, as if I were witnessing an Olympian complete a high jump.For years, people have been suggesting I might want to try learning at least a few recipes. (See also: people I barely know offering, \u201cI feel like yoga would be really good for you!\u201d) And there is a part of me that has watched all of this cooking content with a pang of regret: Maybe I wouldn\u2019t be panic-Googling symptoms or texting people I probably shouldn\u2019t be if I were instead spending hours whipping up a falafel feast or cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e in my kitchen (in this fantasy, I\u2019m also wearing something other than the same two pairs of flannel pants I\u2019ve been alternating between). But right now, I barely have the psychological fortitude to write a coherent email; acquiring a new skill set does not feel within reach.My \u201cquarantine food diary\u201d probably does not look very dissimilar from that of a typical eight-year-old during non-quarantine times. I have reverted to peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, tuna fish sandwiches \u2026 uh, hummus sandwiches. The extent of my \u201cinventive-ness\u201d came a few afternoons ago when I realized we were out of bread, so I fashioned a sandwich out of tuna salad and two slices of turkey. (Take that, everyone showing off their elaborate broths on Instagram Live!). There have been pastas and canned soups and Clif bars and scoops of raisins\u2014and a particularly low point when I peeled a banana with a fork and knife because I still don\u2019t really understand what we should and shouldn\u2019t be touching with our hands. I bought a few bags of the Stacy\u2019s cinnamon sugar chips I used to subsist on as a teenager. Frozen meals reheated. Crackers found in a tin of unknown provenance. I fear I am just days away from wandering around my kitchen in a blanket, pouring cereal into my mouth directly from the box, mixing a bunch of sauces with Sour Patch Kids in a bowl and finding out how it all tastes together.None of what I\u2019ve been eating during this quarantine period is food that one would savor, or that feels particularly healthy or nourishing. But, considering the way I\u2019ve experienced this period of time, days lived tentatively, fearfully, scared of what my phone might have to tell me but also unable to put it away, it also feels like the \u201cright\u201d food. It\u2019s food that serves its purpose, combinations that\u2014in their middle-school essence\u2014manage to spark some kind of nostalgic joy. And at the very root of it all, I am aware of how lucky I am to have this food in my pantry at all.When I\u2019m on Facetime calls with my friends, I find myself staying quiet when everyone else shares their cooking anecdotes. \u201cWhat have you been \u2026 making, Josh?\u201d someone will inevitably ask, and I\u2019ll just laugh: \u201cOh, you know...!\u201d I am sometimes struck by a sense of quasi-embarrassment, that I should be \u201cmaking the most of this time\u201d in the way everyone else seems to be. What is stopping me from being able to concoct an Instagram-ready loaf? But in listening to the tales of others, in viewing the meals on display in my feed, even if I do find myself wanting to roll my eyes at times (We Get It! You Made Bread, Too!), I at least feel like I\u2019m part of a social ecosystem.One night this week\u2014in a moment of particular vulnerability\u2014I came across some chocolate chip cookies posted by someone I\u2019ve met maybe twice. She shared the recipe, which seemed straight-forward enough. I took a screenshot. Could that be me? Attempting these cookies would be hours spent focusing on something\u2014anything other than everything!\u2014that didn\u2019t involve the Internet. I imagined the gratification, the sense of worth and productivity I\u2019d feel. When I talked to my friends later, I\u2019d be able to provide an actual substantive update for them, something other than just \u201cI drank half a bottle of wine and Photoshopped what I\u2019d look like with blonde hair again.\u201dIt was a nice thought. I put my phone down and reached into my bag for another handful of cinnamon sugar chips.Josh Duboff is a New York-based writer still figuring out a non-awkward way to end a Zoom hangout.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCoronavirusFirst PersonRecipes you want to make.
