It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Beginner\u2019s luckMy friend Patrick is a grown man who went to one of England\u2019s fanciest universities\u2014who just bought his first microplane to make Basically\u2019s Shrimp Scampi Pasta. The last time he cooked for me, Patrick boiled water in a Breville electric kettle and then added it to a pot, into which he dropped the pasta. \u201cIt worked, Cookie,\u201d is his defense. (I am Cookie.) But this time he wanted to make a real recipe and I told him \u201canyone\u201d could make this shrimp scampi pasta. When I showed up he was sweating, but the bowls of parsley, onion, and garlic were prepped. Panko was browning in a nonstick pan. \u201cThis is a LOT of cooking, Cookie,\u201d Patrick complained. But water was boiling in a pot on the stove, and everything worked out, even when we realized he didn\u2019t have any kind of strainer so we drained the pasta with the lid on. It worked, Cookie.Get the recipe: Shrimp Scampi PastaDanny KimDo no parmWhat I love about this article on how single New York men love chicken parm is how every time I think it\u2019s about to end, it keeps going. Because there\u2019s so much to say! The men, they love the fried chicken cutlet with cheese and sauce! They proclaim it on their dating profiles! \u201cInterests: Chicken parm\u201d might be as revealing as finding out someone \u201cloves coffee.\u201d But that\u2019s what the date is for, right? Getting to the heart of the matter, like does your love for chicken parm stand in for some unresolved mommy issues, or represent the comfort you are unable to give yourself, or worse\u2014reveal that you still talk with your mouth full of food.The article continues: \u201cThe frustrated single lady\u2014who prefers eggplant parm, by the way\u2014wishes dudes would find something more interesting to focus on.\u201d Like...puffy vests? Be careful what you wish for, lady.Making it at home might be even more romantic: Pietro\u2019s Chicken ParmesanWant this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Photo by Chelsie CraigBucket full of BjornQornThis week on the BA Foodcast I awkwardly debuted a little segment called \u201cCook Marry Kill\u201d\u2014listen! Tell me what you thought, but only if it\u2019s nice! I\u2019m working on my podcast voice, okay? So I talked about the thrilling news of this holiday bucket of BjornQorn, a.k.a. everyone at BA\u2019s favorite hippie popcorn. It\u2019s solar-popped (okay!) and coated in nutritional yeast (fake cheese!) and we go crazy for it. The holiday bucket will be a way to go crazy for a bucket full of it.Read more: BjornQorn Is the Reigning King of BA\u2019s Office Snack TablePhoto by Alex LauWoe is milkThe milk company Dean Foods filed for bankruptcy protection this week, because the end of milk is nigh. Somewhere an executive is wringing their fist to the sky and growling, \u201cOat miiiiiiilk!!!!\u201d After I read that story, I dove into this joy-jolting profile of Tom Hanks in light of his new Mister Rogers movie, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, which takes place in that era when men in sweaters drank pint glasses of whole milk. They\u2019re both so wholesome. But now we\u2019re skeptical of nice old men and swear our skin is clearer when we\u2019re off dairy. We move forward, and the past becomes a selective retreat into nostalgia. \u201cRemember milk?\u201d We\u2019ll say at dinner parties over almond milk panna cotta (which is just a puddle of gray water). I want to see the Mister Rogers movie and go out for ice cream after.Me neitherReader comment of the weekPhoto by Emma Fishman, food styling by Pearl JonesAdrienne C. wrote in about Adam\u2019s pumpkin chiffon pie to share: \u201cMy very Southern grandmother made a pumpkin chiffon pie for Thanksgiving, but hers had a gingersnap crust (those rock-hard conventional grocery store ones) that added spice and offset the sweetness. She used slightly sweetened whipped cream on top and sprinkled a bit of chopped crystallized ginger on it. Delicious! It even won over confirmed pumpkin pie haters. The best part: anytime someone said they couldn\u2019t possibly have room for dessert, she\u2019d say, \u2018Well honey, it\u2019s just air!\u2019\u201dGet the recipe: Pumpkin Chiffon Pie**See the comments there about people fearing raw egg? According to Dr. Aaron Carroll\u2019s wonderful book The Bad Food Bible, the risk of an egg containing salmonella is 0.012 percent. \u201cYou could eat one raw egg every week for one hundred years and still have a good chance of never eating an egg with salmonella.\u201d Now give me that raw cookie dough.Photo by Alex LauHappy BirthdaySpeaking of Adam Rapoport, FRIDAY WAS HIS BIRTHDAY. Of course he\u2019s a Scorpio! On Thursday, we surprised him with some custom, vodka-based cocktails (thanks Al!), a song about all of his ...qualities\u2026 by Julia Kramer to the tune of Neil Young\u2019s \u201cOld Man,\u201d and a giant cake made by Sohla El-Waylly. It was RIDICULOUS. She made a parsley cake (as in the herb), dehydrated it, and processed it into crumbs to create a golf course grass topping. I mean come on! The cake inside is hazelnut praline and chocolate. Salted caramel buttercream frosting. And there\u2019s a layer of crunchy hazelnut cookies for texture. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if he likes cake,\u201d said Sohla. Happy birthday, Boss!Unnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Yekaterina BoytsovaWe published a new sweet potato recipe with cute crunchies on Basically this week, which prompted the question: Why do we like sweet potatoes so much? Aren\u2019t potato-potatoes better?\u201cPeople pretend they like sweet potatoes more because \u2018health,\u2019\u201d said Christina Chaey who simultaneously rolled her eyes and did air quotes. \u201cSweet!\u201d said Amanda Shapiro and Sarah Jampel.\u201c100 to 1 people want potatoes over sweet potatoes,\u201d said the numerically dubious birthday boy. \u201cAnd don\u2019t even say sweet potato fries\u2014I don\u2019t need to take a time machine to 1980.\u201d\u201cI eat more sweet potatoes because they\u2019re better for me,\u201d said self-knowing Andy Baraghani, \u201cbut potato-potatoes are better. I like them boiled, scalloped, creamed, smashed crispy, french fries, potato puffs, chips\u2026\u201d\u201cSweet pota-\u201d began Priya Krishna before she interrupted herself. \u201cHOW COULD I SAY THAT. TATER TOTS.\u201d\u201cBeggs, what kind of potato-potato?\u201d demanded Carla Lalli Music. \u201cI\u2019d have a sweet P over a russet. Russets are kinda dry and floury. Only good for a baked potato. But I wouldn\u2019t choose a sweet potato over a fingerling, which has so much to offer. You can fry it. Roast it. Chip it. Confit it. Now that\u2019s a potato [Italian hand gesture]. Frankly, some sweet potatoes are better than others. Is there anything better than a Japanese sweet potato? No! A garnet yam plays second fiddle.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecookingMake Me This Shrimp Scampi Recipe and I'll Help You Move Into Your Six-Floor Walk-UpBy Alex DelanyrestaurantsChicken Parm Is My Self-CareBy Carey PoliscookingThe Lightest, Creamiest Pumpkin Chiffon PieBy Adam RapoportcookingPut Down Your Knife and Tear Up Your Food By Hand\u00a0By Jesse SparksRecipes you want to make.
