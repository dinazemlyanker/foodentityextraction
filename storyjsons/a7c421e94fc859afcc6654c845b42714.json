Don\u2019t skip the kecap manis\u2014the syrupy Indonesian soy sauce is what gives nasi goreng its caramelization and depth.By Meera SodhaNovember 15, 20203.9(35)Read ReviewsTriangleEmailPinterestPrintPhoto by Laura Murray, Food Styling by Micah MortonEmailPinterestPrintEmailPinterestPrintThis take on the beloved Indonesian fried rice dish nasi goreng is from Meera Sodha\u2019s cookbook East: 120 Easy and Delicious Asian-Inspired Vegetarian and Vegan Recipes. Kecap manis, a syrupy Indonesian soy sauce that\u2019s sweetened with palm sugar and often infused with spices like star anise and black pepper, gives nasi goreng its characteristic caramelization and depth. Meera starts with a classic approach, smothering cooked long-grain rice in \u201cumami-ific sauces,\u201d and then riffs, topping her version \u201cwith shredded, marinated brussels sprouts for crunch and zing.\u201d Kecap manis is available at large supermarkets, online, and in Southeast Asian stores\u2014if you can\u2019t find it, though, you can follow Meera\u2019s approximation below. For a more traditional nasi goreng, served with a fried egg and sambal matah, check out Lara Lee\u2019s recipe.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

(or more) white wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar, divided2Tbsp. toasted sesame oil1tsp. sugarPreparationStep 1\u00a0If you don\u2019t have kecap manis, approximate it by stirring together\u00a0 3 Tbsp. agave nectar \u00a0 \u00a0 and \u00a01 Tbsp. dark soy sauce \u00a0 (dark soy has a much deeper molasses flavor than normal soy) in a small bowl. Set agave mixture aside. \u00a0Step 2Bring 2\u00bd cups water to a boil in an electric kettle, teapot, or saucepan. Place 1\u00be cups jasmine rice in a fine-mesh sieve and rinse under cold running water until water runs clear. Transfer rice to a medium saucepan, then pour in boiling water and return to a boil. Cover pan and reduce heat to as low as possible; cook 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let steam while you prepare the brussels sprouts.Step 3Trim bottoms and remove any tough or wilty outer leaves from 1\u00be lb. brussels sprouts. Using a chef\u2019s knife, slice sprouts as thinly as possible. (Alternatively, you can use a food processor fitted with shredding disk.) Chop 1 medium red onion, crush 4 garlic cloves under the flat side of your knife, and finely chop 3 red or green Thai chiles (remove ribs and seeds first if you prefer less heat).Step 4Heat 3 Tbsp. vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook onion, stirring, until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and two thirds of chopped chiles and cook, stirring often, until very fragrant, about 2 minutes.Step 5Set 2 large handfuls of brussels sprouts aside in a medium bowl. Add remaining brussels sprouts to skillet and cook, stirring every 2 minutes or so, until beginning to brown, about 8 minutes. Stir in 2 Tbsp. tomato paste, 2 Tbsp. kecap manis or reserved agave mixture, 1\u00bc tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00be tsp. Morton kosher salt, 1 Tbsp. soy sauce, and 1 Tbsp. white wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar and cook, stirring often, 5 minutes; remove from heat.Step 6Add 2 Tbsp. toasted sesame oil, 1 tsp. sugar, remaining chopped chiles, and remaining 1 Tbsp. soy sauce, and remaining 1 Tbsp. white wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar to reserved raw brussels sprouts and toss well to coat. Taste and add more vinegar if you want more zing.Step 7To finish nasi goreng, return skillet to medium heat and add steamed rice. Cook, stirring gently, until heated through and rice is incorporated, about 5 minutes. Taste and season with more salt if needed. Transfer to a platter and scatter raw brussels sprouts over.\u00a0Adapted from EAST by Meera Sodha. Copyright \u00a9 2020 by\u00a0Meera Sodha. Reprinted with permission from Flatiron Books.
