If you choose to use it, the pinch of cayenne adds a pleasing bit of warmth. You can also top the cake with 2 tablespoons granulated sugar mixed with 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon and another pinch of cayenne instead of the glaze. If you're making a loaf cake, halve the sugar-spice mixture.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Line pan with parchment paper, leaving overhang on all sides if using square pan or long side if using loaf pan. Use a parchment paper round on the bottom if using cake pan.Step 2Whisk 2 large eggs and \u00be cup (packed; 150 g) light brown sugar in a large bowl until pale and foamy, about 1 minute.Step 3Add 1 cup (230 g) unsweetened pumpkin pur\u00e9e, \u00bd cup extra-virgin olive oil, \u00bd cup whole milk, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, 1 tsp. ground cinnamon, \u00bd tsp.

It was so moist and perfectly spiced. I raised my baking bar by baking this cake. I will definitely be baking another one soon to share with friends.BrigitteArizona11/16/2021I think the cake is really nice, moist, not too dense nor tender, and chocolate-y. Unfortunately the only purpose of the pumpkin in this recipe is to give moisture and some added nutrition perhaps. I didn't think it needed a glaze (although it was yummy) as the cake itself was already sweet ehough for my taste. I loved how easy it was to put together though. I personally would add perhaps more cinnamon and cayenne next time, maybe even black pepper would be nice. As-is it does not come across as a spiced or pumpkin cake, rather a chocolate one. I feel like I probably won't make this version of cake unless I happen to have extra pumpkin around, I'll just make a chocolate cake instead. But still a great recipe!!!!DChutoronto, canada10/27/2021I went off of the other reviews and upped the spice - 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp of pumpkin spice in the cake and 1/4 tsp pumpkin spice in the icing. I was bummed I was out of cayenne, it would have been a nice addition. Make sure to be careful with the cloves in the icing; it's very easy to do too much! I am celiac so made some swaps for a GF version: 1 cup of bobs all purpose flour (includes xanthan), 1 tsp baking soda, and 1/2 tsp xanthan gum. I realized after the fact that I should have decreased the liquid a bit and added another egg but still came out absolutely delicious even if a bit dense. love this recipe because it uses basic pantry staples and was simple enough to bake on a weeknight after work! Madi Baltimore, MD10/26/2021A solid recipe! The pumpkin isn\u2019t that noticeable, but it definitely adds a richness that I don\u2019t think you\u2019d get without it. Also, the cayenne is wonderful in this \u2014 it adds a toasty warmth that is very reminiscent of Mexican hot chocolate :) JessicaSioux Falls10/25/2021I thought this was a really nice fall loaf. I didn't have whole milk so subbed 50/50 heavy cream and oat milk in both the batter and the glaze, which worked fine. I also subbed chopped peanut butter cups for the chocolate chips. The pumpkin flavor is subtle; next time I might add some pumpkin pie spice. Don't rush the cooling before adding the glaze. Lauren DProvidence RI10/7/2021Well written recipe. Love the weight measurements in the instructions. Beautifully chocolatey. I used butternut squash instead of pumpkin, but the flavour was overpowered by the chocolate. Might need more pumpkin. While I got away with a pinch of cayenne in the batter, a little goes a long way in the glaze. I used a 9\"  cake tin and got a fairly short cake. More like a brownie. Still tasty though!AnonymousNairobi, KE3/8/2021A truly excellent cake--though I am a sucker for chocolate paired with warm spices. The pumpkin makes this cake extra moist! I couldn't stop cutting off bits to snack on as I walked by. I also made my cake gluten- and dairy-free using Almond Breeze Unsweetened Original Almond Milk and King Arthur Gluten-Free All-Purpose Flour. Textures and flavors are spot-on! Definitely will make it again, and probably soon!AnonymousFranklin, TN1/16/2021Great recipe! I made it in a bundt cake mold and only cooked it 30min. It was just perfect: moist, good balance with the glaze. I used a little more liquid for the glaze to achieve a pourable consistency. Definitely a keeper! AnonymousSan Francisco12/23/2020So good! I didn\u2019t get the right consistency for the glaze, but it was delicious. I recommend. JJB12/13/2020This was so easy! And very delicious. Def not too sweet. Next time I\u2019d add a bigger \u201cpinch\u201d of cayenne. Will be making again! JennNew York 12/11/2020I added more than a pinch of cayenne and a bit of nutmeg too - so delicious!Anonymous12/10/2020This was an easy and tasty cake. There was very little pumpkin flavored it could have used more spice.  It is a solid one bowl cake.AnonymousVT12/7/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titCakeDessertLoaf CakePumpkinSquashVegetableChocolateOther IngredientsFallSnackNut-FreeBakingBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
