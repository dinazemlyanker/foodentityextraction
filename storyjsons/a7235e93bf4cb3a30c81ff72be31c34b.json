Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Dear Healthyish readers,Would you believe me if I told you the most exciting thing in my life right now is a...spreadsheet of all the things in my pantry/fridge/freezer? I started it a few weeks ago after I couldn\u2019t get the freezer door to shut, did a quick intake of what all was in there, and realized about 80 percent of it was mine (sorry, Emma and Becca!).Before I attempted to shove everything back in the freezer, I made a resolution to cook with at least one frozen thing a day (because what was I saving it all for, anyway?). I logged every single item in a Google Sheet, possibly the most Big Virgo Energy thing this Sagittarius has ever done. (I know Healthyish editor/Virgo Amanda Shapiro will appreciate this reference.) I made categories for fish, meat, carbs (tortillas, ramen noodles), and frozen vegetables. I made columns titled \u201cQuantity\u201d and \u201cUse For,\u201d where I jotted down recipe ideas. And pretty soon, my \u201cQuarantine Pantry\u201d spreadsheet became one of those permanently-open tabs in my browser, next to all the longform articles I keep promising myself I will read this weekend.I\u2019ve since added tabs for fresh produce, dried goods, condiments, and baking supplies. I\u2019ve learned that knowing how much of something I have is crucial, because the second I realize I\u2019m almost out, I\u2019m motivated to find a way to use it up sooner rather than later. (Which is how a couple of almost-empty jars of pumpkin and sunflower seeds and a container of frozen egg whites recently became a batch of Granola Cluster Cookies.)The beginnings of Granola Cluster Cookies\u00a0\nI\u2019ve also been copy/pasting in links to inspiring recipe ideas I come across. When I see a line in the spreadsheet that says I have a pound of Italian sausage in the freezer, I can also see notes I\u2019ve written for myself that say things like, \u201csausage and greens lasagna; broccoli bolognese; lentil soup.\u201d Each of those excites me just reading them\u2014all that\u2019s left to do is pick one.Almost three weeks in, I\u2019m happy to report I can finally see the back wall of the freezer again. Using the spreadsheet as my guide, I\u2019ve slowly chipped away at my stash, turning corn tortillas into enchiladas, pints of frozen red wine and beef broth into comforting mushroom bourguignon (a Smitten Kitchen classic), and stewing up quick pots of cod chowder. What started out as an attempt to get organized has become an invaluable tool in quarantine, as indispensable as my cast iron skillet or Microplane. I have no idea how long this system will last. But for the time being, when I\u2019m barely leaving the house and seeing no one but my roommates, this is my idea of \u201cmaking my own fun.\u201d And if kitchen organization is your jam, stay tuned for next week\u2019s newsletter, where I will probably write 500 words on how obsessed I am with my new tape-cutter for labeling things around the kitchen. Call it the new me!!!Wishing you a meticulously organized weekend,Christina ChaeyAssociate editor, chronically disorganized except when it comes to the pantry now(P.S. You can listen to Adam Rapoport making fun of me for how much I love my pantry spreadsheet on the upcoming episode of the BA Foodcast, which comes out on Wednesday 5/20.)Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishWhat's Chaey Cooking?essayRead MoreLifestyleThe Recipe I Make For My Mom Every YearBy Christina ChaeyRecipes you want to make.
