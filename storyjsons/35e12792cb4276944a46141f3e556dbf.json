A quick lesson from Montreal Bagels 101: This bread is chewy and slightly sweet (it\u2019s boiled in honey water!), and it\u2019s almost impossible to eat just one.ORDER: any of the bagels, but you can\u2019t go wrong with the earthy rosemary one or the sesame-poppy seed bagel (it looks like a black and white cookie!). Help yourself to the condiments\u2014butter, cream cheese, smoked salmon, and jelly\u2014at the self-serve area, but don\u2019t expect anyone to slice your bagel in half for a sandwich. These bagels are made for ripping, dipping, and walking as you eat.THE VIBE IS: steamy. The ovens are blasting, so it can get a little toasty inside, but you won\u2019t mind with that intoxicating smell wafting throughout the space. The service can be lukewarm, but at least the bagels are always hot.PRACTICAL STUFF: There are six locations across Quebec, so check the website for specific opening days and time, but the flagship outpost is in Mile End, open 24/7, and located just down the street from Caf\u00e9 Olimpico. Pair them together for an ideal simple, cheap breakfast. Heads up: St-Viateur is cash-only.\u2014Alyse WhitneyPhoto by Dominique LafondWE ALSO LOVEBoucherie LawrenceAll the Mile End goods to smuggle back homeDieu du CielChoose your own microbrew adventure in Mile EndCaf\u00e9 OlimpicoGet your caffeine fix at this Mile End espresso shopExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
