There isn\u2019t a craft bar that matches Gold Star\u2019s service, selection, and general enthusiasm for beer in the borough. Co-owner and bartender Joshua van Horn will most likely be slinging beers when you\u2019re there, happy to run through the tap list from top to bottom. The beer rules. The people rule. The record collection rules. And the stadium-style bar seating rules, too.ORDER THE: beer. Duh. Gold Star keeps 16 beers on tap, ranging from spontaneously fermented ales to unfiltered lagers to fruity sours to juicy IPAs. It doesn\u2019t matter what type of beer you like, Gold Star will have something that you\u2019ll happily order again. And if you need something to anchor all those brews, Gold Star has a small food menu. The standout is the salami picante sandwich, a beautiful sub layered with spicy salami, ham, provolone, lettuce, and onions, and slathered with tangy olive tapenade and creamy sub sauce. This sandwich rules.WORD TO THE WISE: Gold Star\u2019s tap list is always impressive, but their list of bottles and cans should not be overlooked. They sit on the shelves and can be taken to go or consumed on premises. Gold Star stocks some incredible bottles of rare American and European beers, so make sure to ask whoever\u2019s behind the bar what they\u2019re digging.THE VIBE IS: airy, natural, and not-so-craft-beer-ish (no battered wood tables, bro-y posters). Gold Star is great any night of the week, but grabbing a seat on a warm weekend afternoon, when the front door is propped open and light streams in from the high windows, leaves you feeling like you\u2019ve stepped into the living room of a Danish architect who has a thing for vintage Americana.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day: Sunday to Thursday, from noon to midnight, and Friday and Saturday, from noon to 1:00 a.m. A $3 corkage fee is added to any bottle or can consumed on the premises.\u2014Alex DelanyWE ALSO LOVEBemelmans BarFlawless cocktails in a flawless Upper East Side roomOlmstedA Brooklyn neighborhood restaurant that\u2019s unlike any other Brooklyn neighborhood restaurantBar GotoSublime cocktails and elevated bar snacks on the Lower East Side?
