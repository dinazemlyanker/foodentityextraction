See our past recommendations here!Most days I\u2019m perfectly happy keeping my chai routine simple: just water, black tea, and spices. It\u2019s strong and good with just the right amount of heat. (My tip: Add what seems like the right amount of ginger and then triple it.) But on rare occasions\u2014particularly gloomy rain-filled days or homesick ones\u2014I confess I have tried to re-create the milky-sweet tea from my grandmother\u2019s house in India. It\u2019s an attempt to replicate the comfort and coziness her drink stands for in my mind.I\u2019ve never quite gotten it right. Maybe I used the wrong tea, the wrong mix of spices, or the wrong alt milk. Maybe I can\u2019t get the timing down on exactly when to add what to the boiling pot of water: Add the tea too early and it\u2019s too strong, add the spices too late and it\u2019s too bland\u2026and when does the milk go in again? Or maybe it\u2019s simply because I haven\u2019t tasted that tea in about a decade, since I started to avoid lactose, and I\u2019ve been chasing a memory more than anything else.So I was thrilled when I first tried One Stripe Chai\u2019s new masala chai blend, which made a cup of tea that would be right at home at family gatherings in Delhi but is also foolproof enough for me to make, alone and multitasking, in Brooklyn. I\u2019ve known founder Farah Jesani for years and think the company\u2019s chai concentrate is the best on the market (their earthy haldi doodh blend is equally game-changing) and stands out against competitors for being not too sweet and actually well-spiced.I had yet to find a dry mix worth spending money on, so I was cautiously optimistic about its new loose-leaf blend. Most blends, in my experience, make a cup of tea that ends up too bitter or too weak, and over the years I kind of gave up. But One Stripe\u2019s blend is spiced exactly to my taste (spicy!) and doesn\u2019t need sweetener, and even more than that, the directions make the preparation so easy: Mix equal parts water and choice of milk together with a few teaspoons of the masala chai and boil them for a few minutes. It takes the guesswork out of the process, simplifying chai so that it isn\u2019t an elusive alchemy. It\u2019s just a very, very good drink.Chai Me At Home Blend$16 at Etsy$16 at One Stripe ChaiLove very good drinks?
