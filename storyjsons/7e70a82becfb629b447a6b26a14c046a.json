The spare, friendly space, located on Nyhavn Harbor just across the bridge that leads to Barr is the perfect place for a few snacks and carefully composed plates that lean very Danish (confit herring with rosemary mayo) to pair with the biodynamic wine list.ORDER THE: sourdough with fresh cheese and olive oil (add lumpfish roe in spring); \u201ccrisp\u201d with smoked mackerel; and a bottle of anything from hard-to-get producer L\u2019Anglore. Come summer, a grill has been known to appear on the large outdoor terrace across the street for the best kind of barbecues.THE VIBE IS: pleasantly chill, with off-duty chefs and natural-wine tourists geeking out in a brick-and-blond-wood room.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open for dinner Tuesday to Friday, from 4 p.m. to 11 p.m.; Saturday, from 1 p.m. to 11 p.m.; and Sunday, from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. Closed Monday.\u2014Christine MuhlkePhoto by Ditte IsagerWE ALSO LOVEAncestraleIn Vesterbro, a cool little wine bar (and a relief to your wallet) VinskabetIndulge your inner wine geek at this breezy N\u00f8rrebro bar.Ved Stranden 10Get lost in natural wines at this living room-esque Indre By barExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
