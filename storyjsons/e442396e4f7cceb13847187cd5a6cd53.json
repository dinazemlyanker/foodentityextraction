It\u2019s white in color, firm and dry in texture, and salty and milky in flavor. When it\u2019s younger (as in, aged for a shorter amount of time), its texture is akin to that of feta: moist and crumbly. And when it\u2019s older (aged for longer), it becomes sharper and firmer, more similar to Parmesan. While ricotta salata is sometimes suggested as a substitute, Cotija has a distinct funk that can\u2019t be so easily replicated.You can buy it in a block, which allows you to break or shave it into pieces of any size, or you can get it pre-grated. The grated stuff is similar to the finest pre-grated parm you see at the grocery store (the kind that looks like fluffy snow), and it\u2019s what we call for on the elote. Simultaneously light and bitsy, it sticks to the corn perfectly.While Cotija will soften with heat, it doesn\u2019t melt, making it most suited for crumbling and sprinkling. Of course, it\u2019s most frequently in Mexican cooking\u2014you might see it as a finishing flourish on enchiladas, nachos, tacos, chilaquiles, or posole. (It even makes an appearance on the Venezuelan sticky buns called golfeados.) But if there\u2019s anything to know, it\u2019s that Cotija is a beautifully versatile cheese that can (and should) be employed outside of those classic dishes.I'll fight you for those cheesy bits!\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensIn this veggie burger, for instance, it\u2019s worked in with the mushroom and black bean mixture to flavor to the patty. And because it\u2019s such a dry cheese, it doesn\u2019t mess up the consistency of the burger. You could even swap it for the feta in these meatballs.In general, you can use younger, softer Cotija as a stand-in for Greek feta, and\u2014as long as you\u2019re not trying to emulsify it into a pasta sauce\u2014the older, harder version in place of parm. (This corn salad even calls for Cotija, feta, or parm, depending on what you have around!) Try Cotija in Plum Salad with Black Pepper or Napa Cabbage Salad with Pistachios. Want to marinate it for a supremely easy, fancy-looking party app? Sure! Toss in this tomato number? Absolutely. Load it on top of these Smashed Crispy Potaoes! Grate it over a watermelon-lime salad for a hit of salt! Sprinkle it all over your next frittata!.So go ahead, buy some cotija for elote\u2014and then use up the rest. And then buy some more. It\u2019ll be gone before you know it.Get the recipe:No-Grill EloteEverything you love about Mexican elote\u2014the charred kernels, the creamy-spicy-salty sauce, lots of lime\u2014without the grill.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCheeseMexicanRecipes you want to make.
