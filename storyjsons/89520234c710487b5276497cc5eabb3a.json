And butter. So I thought to myself, What would FoodTok put on air-fryer brussels sprouts? And the answer was ranch seasoning. And it was so so good. But, at the insistence of my editor, this article is not about ranch seasoning\u2014it\u2019s about air-frying.While I\u2019m still new to the world of air-frying, I do know that brussels sprouts and air fryers are meant to be. That continuous blast of hot air gets the sprouts crispy on the outside while keeping the insides tender, and the leaves that get blown off will be even more brittle and charred. As long as you make sure there\u2019s enough oil coating the vegetables for them to sizzle and brown (in this case, two tablespoons is sufficient), an air fryer does a better job than most ovens ever could. I\u2019m not hosting Thanksgiving this year, praise be, but if I were I\u2019d put my air fryer to work on this recipe and free up my oven to handle what it does best\u2014the turkey\u2014and the stove to take care of\u2026too many other things.COSORI Air\u00a0Fryer\u00a0Max$120 at AmazonThe brussels sprouts alone might be crispy-charred perfection, but the butter is the real reason I keep telling everyone I know about this recipe. On our air-fryer episode of \u201cFood People,\u201d Rachel described it as \u201ca sweet, sticky, tangy, golden sauce,\u201d and ever since then I\u2019ve been dreaming about it. First, fresh ginger and ground turmeric get sizzled in a little olive oil, then comes butter, honey, crushed red pepper flakes, salt, and, finally, lemon juice. If it sounds like an explosion of flavors packed into a luscious amount of butter that gets poured over your hot, crispy sprouts, well, that\u2019s exactly what it is.No shade to ranch seasoning, but this recipe is better. A total cinch and a Thanksgiving savior, all you need to do is steal a burner long enough to make that sauce and you\u2019re golden. And crispy. And buttery. Perfection.Get the recipe:Air Fryer Crispy Brussels Sprouts With Honey ButterThese Brussel sprouts are a textural masterpiece: crisp on the outside, tender inside, and drizzled with an indulgent honey butter.\u00a0View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingThanksgivingRecipes you want to make.
