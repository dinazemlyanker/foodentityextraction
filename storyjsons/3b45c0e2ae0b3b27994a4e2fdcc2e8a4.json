Made a nice tangy salad.johnnyontario7/4/2021THIS is the salad I want to eat all summer long.  I make it with vegan mayo to turn this recipe vegan and it is just the most refreshing thing ever on a hot day.  I never would have thought to treat cabbage like you would kale in a salad by tearing it and massaging it.  I've made this with regular green cabbage and it works just as well.  I could eat the entire bowl in one sitting.  SO GOOD!Alyssa M.Bay Area, CA6/13/2021Dressing was a bit too rich imoAnonymous12/30/2020This salad is so good!
