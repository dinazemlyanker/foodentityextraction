It\u2019s a snack that exists in America and in India. Here I toss them in chile and coriander, which is very Indian, but it reminds me of those Cajun peanuts.\u201d While fresh, shell-on peanuts are available only at harvest time and are hard to find, unroasted, shell-on peanuts work just as well and can be found in supermarkets and online.IngredientsMakes about 4 cups4cups fresh (green) or raw (unroasted) shell-on peanuts (about 11.5 oz.)4tsp. kosher salt2Tbsp. coriander seeds, divided1Tbsp. flaky sea salt1\u00bdtsp. red chile powder, preferably KashmiriPreparationStep 1Combine peanuts, kosher salt, and 1 Tbsp. coriander seeds in a medium saucepan. Pour in water to cover and stir to combine. Let peanuts sit in brine, stirring here and there, 3 hours.Step 2Bring peanut mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat, partially cover pan, and simmer, adding more water as needed to keep peanuts covered, until peanuts are tender with no crunch left at all, 2 hours if fresh, 4\u20134\u00bd hours if raw. Drain; let cool.Step 3Meanwhile, lightly crush remaining 1 Tbsp. coriander seeds with a mortar and pestle (or gather on a cutting board and crush with a skillet). Mix in a small bowl with sea salt and chile powder.Step 4Transfer peanuts to a bowl and toss with about three-fourths of spice mixture. Serve peanuts with remaining spice mixture alongside for sprinkling over.How would you rate Boiled Peanuts With Chile Salt?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkExplore Bon App\u00e9titIndianSouth AsianAsianPeanutNutSnackVeganVegetarianDairy-FreeGluten-FreeHealthyishNew Year'sRecipes you want to make.
