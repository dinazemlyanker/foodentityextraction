See our past recommendations here!I still panic sometimes while cooking dinner for my family. It's not the nervy anxiety that comes with cooking for crowds or large dinner parties, but the grinding dread of coming up with a meal that everyone will eat. A family\u2019s worth of highly idiosyncratic thoughts about what constitutes deliciousness has slowly chipped away at my enthusiasm for cooking at home, where I am in a constant struggle to deliver non-sugar based-calories to small children. The more effort I put into dinner, the higher the potential for emotional free-fall when my 4-year-old won\u2019t touch it. Or touch anything that it might have touched.These days I always try to make something for dinner that I know my kids will eat, but save some energy for working on new dishes that might be more of a stretch for them. That is where Maya Kaimal comes in. Not her, exactly, although I can't think of many people I would rather have cook for me. I'm talking about her eponymous line of wildly flavorful sauces, inspired by her family's versions of Indian dishes originating from various parts of the country. The shelf-stable jars have been a short-cut of mine for years, allowing me to build incredibly rich and complex flavors in my cooking without frankly having to work very hard. At all.I often combine the tangy, tomato-forward tikka masala sauce with boneless, skinless chicken thighs and simmer until they're fall-apart tender. Or I will combine the mellower, richer butter masala sauce with chopped potatoes and green beans and let them stew into a fragrant side dish. My kids are into these milder sauces, which are fantastic at providing tons of flavor without really being spicy, but I'm quietly hoping that I'll be able to increase their tolerance for spicy foods over time. Perhaps in a few years they will graduate to the hot and sour punch of spicy vindaloo, or the chile-forward kick of Madras curry. Who knows. A cook, and a parent, can always dream.Buy it: Maya Kaimal Tikka Masala, $5All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
