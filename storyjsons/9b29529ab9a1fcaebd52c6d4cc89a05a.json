When something's so easy to make that you don't even need one. Welcome to It's That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.I love the silky suppleness of chawanmushi, the Japanese savory egg custard. And I love the fluffy unevenness of the American diner-staple scrambled eggs. Somewhere in between these two planes lie one of the most delectable and practical egg dishes of all time: steamed eggs. (I could be biased, though, as it was one of the first solid foods I ate.)What are steamed eggs? As opposed to being an established dish of any specificity, steaming eggs is a homestyle Chinese method for cooking eggs. Here\u2019s how to do it: Crack a few eggs are into a bowl, whisk them together with a generous splash of water (a must-have to ensure its soft, custardy set), a sprinkle of salt and finely ground white pepper (the go-to for light-colored foods, rather than black pepper). Then place it on a steamer rack inside a pot (or inside an electric rice cooker) with a shallow pool of water that\u2019s been brought to a simmer, then cover the pot for five minutes or so, until the steam turns the eggs roughly the color and texture of softened butter. According to my mother, it\u2019s a typical Chinese baby food, not something you\u2019ll find in cookbooks and certainly not at Chinese restaurants.Karon Liu, a Chinese Canadian food writer at The Toronto Star, concurs. \u201cChinese parents usually make steamed eggs for babies when they switch over to solid food,\u201d he says. His grandmother\u2019s signature bowl of steamed eggs, which he enjoyed as a child, had seasoned ground pork mixed into the custard. \u201cThere\u2019s no right or wrong way to do it, some add chopped salted duck eggs or thousand year eggs, others add pickled mustard greens.\u201dHsiao-Ching Chou, author of Chinese Soul Food, also remembers the dish fondly from early childhood. \u201cI have distinct memories of being in the little apartment that we were in when I was four years old, looking up at my dad standing by the stove carefully lifting a pan with this egg in it out of the steamer,\u201d just a wok with a lid. Her father would prepare a stir-fried tomato topping for the steamed eggs, so it was akin to a tomato-and-egg scramble, another popular Chinese homestyle dish. Chou is working on her second cookbook, on vegetarian Chinese cooking, that will include a steamed egg dish like her father made it.Aside from the requisite salt and white pepper, my mother usually added scallions when she made steamed eggs for me. But sometimes I just wanted pure, steamed egginess to spoon up like ice cream without any chocolate chips. (While air bubbles are considered a textural flaw in chawanmushi or flan, I found they made steamed eggs all the more crave-worthy, forming in lace-like patterns around the edges of the bowl.) Later on, when I was in between New York City apartments or if the gas wasn\u2019t working in the one I was in, I would remember how to make a satisfying dinner by plugging in my rice cooker and placing a small bowl inside it with beaten eggs and water. I sometimes added chopped bits of this and that, like ham, peppers, and onion for a \u201cWestern\u201d omelette-inspired steamed egg bowl. I never went so far as to add cheese to steamed eggs, but don\u2019t see why you couldn\u2019t.I sometimes wonder why a dish using this technique hasn\u2019t been catapulted to fame somehow\u2014why hasn\u2019t steamed eggs spawned irresistible, eggy adaptations, stuffed with sophisticated treasures like dried scallops or trumpet mushrooms, and dabbled with adult-appropriate toppings, like chile oil and cilantro? Steamed eggs are better than a \u201cblank canvas\u201d\u2014they\u2019re a savory, creamy cushion for whatever your heart desires or leftovers allow.But maybe home cooks who know of this eggy flex are often too attached to the nostalgia of childhood versions. And then I remember how much I craved the straight-up custard, sans other stuff, as a kid.\u201cYou have to appreciate the nuance of the egg itself,\u201d says Chou. \u201cBut at the same time you can have flavors that enhance that core flavor profile and texture.\u201dIf it\u2019s your first encounter with the ethereally fluffy baby-food specialty, give it a try more or less on its own. A dab of chile oil and a smattering of fresh herbs like cilantro are a good starting point\u2014and you may just want to stop there.Cathy Erway is a cookbook writer, podcast host, and blogger living in New York.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimpleRecipes you want to make.
