Jamie Guan quietly chops scallions. Tomo Shinoda rolls udon noodle dough through a hefty machine that slices each pudgy slab into thick strands. They\u2019ll go into an intensely flavorful broth for niku [beef] udon, the one thing (yes, one thing) this restaurant cooks, which is so profoundly delicious it earned Yume Ga Arukara a place on our Hot 10 list this year. But right now it\u2019s 4:42 p.m., 18 minutes before the restaurant opens and several months before our list is revealed. All of the sudden, a flash of yellow darts through the dining room.\u201cOhayo!\u201d Tsuyoshi Nishioka yells to his cooks. \u201cHai!\u201d \u201cHai!\u201d They yell back, dropping everything to greet the 39-year-old udon master. Nishioka\u2019s wearing a yellow X-Large baseball cap from the pioneering L.A. streetwear brand and a flour-flecked black shirt with his restaurant\u2019s name and its tagline, \u201cBecause I have dreams,\u201d on the back. His introduction to udon was at at Setouichi Seimen, a renowned udon shop in Osaka, seven years ago. He finally learned how to make it from the master there last summer.As the staff gathers around him for the pre-service meeting, he asks: \u201cWhat are your goals for the year and for today?\u201d\u201cTo finish my project this year and, tonight, to be really fast,\u201d explains Guan, a prep cook who by day works as a furniture designer and builder.\u201cLearn how to make udon and open my own place,\u201d says Shinoda, a recent college grad and Yume Ga Arukara\u2019s head chef, his thick eyebrows furrowed beneath a backwards baseball cap. Only 24 years old, Shinoda can come off as serious and soft-spoken, but he\u2019s also eager to learn and quick to laugh. \u201cAnd then, to pick up quickly tonight,\u201d he adds.Nishioka beams and nods emphatically. \u201cMy goal for the year is to not buy any new clothes, books, or anything. My goal for today is to make the best noodles,\u201d the chef says. \u201cNow please stretch and touch your toes,\u201d Nishioka instructs. It\u2019s nine minutes till service.Nishioka is all smiles.\nPhoto by Elizabeth CecilFind Your DreamsNishioka wasn\u2019t always a noodle head. He started off as a comedian in Kyoto and worked in restaurants to supplement his comedy career, performing solo and in a trio with friends. Then he discovered the famous chain Ramen Jiro, which invented the tonkotsu-shoyu hybrid known as the Jiro style of ramen. After he left comedy to pursue ramen, one of his trio members committed suicide. Stunned, Nishioka researched all he could about suicide and realized it was an epidemic in Japan. (It\u2019s the leading cause of death among people between 15 to 39 years old.)\u201cFor young people, they\u2019re afraid of failing. They think they always need to succeed, and if they fail, there is no reason to live for the future,\u201d he explains.\u201cThat\u2019s very bleak,\u201d I tell him.\u201cThat\u2019s Japan,\u201d he responds.After trying to open his own ramen-ya in Japan, he decided to move to the U.S. in 2011 and debuted the Jiro ramen-powered Yume Wo Katare a year later, with as much intent to nurture young cooks as intent to cook excellent ramen. That\u2019s why he picked Cambridge, abundant with students under pressure. Like his follow-up, Yume Wo Katare serves only one dish. In addition, it offers dream workshops. Yes, dream workshops.Speak Your DreamsOne afternoon, I attended a dream workshop with seven or so employees and one loyal customer. Seated at the desk-like tables crammed into Yume Wo Katare and facing each other, we went around sharing our goals in a sentence, starting with Michael Fang, an employee of the ramen-ya. \u201cI want to be a better boyfriend from now on,\u201d he said. Immediately, Nishioka rifled through the dozens of worksheets he\u2019s created for the workshops and handed it to Fang to fill out on his own.Entitled \u201cProject Analysis,\u201d it listed a bunch of questions, asking why he\u2019s doing this (for his girlfriend), strength and skill sets he already has (communication), and obstacles he foresees (busyness). Once Fang wrote in these answers, Nishioka pushed him with lots of not totally clear but very enthusiastic hand gestures to read the worksheet outloud to the group. \u201cYou make a good relationship with everyone,\u201d Nishioka said to Fang after he shares. \u201cBut not your girlfriend? Why?\u201d Fang furiously took down the firm but caring advice on his sheet.Then Nishioka went back to meticulously picking a worksheet, all neatly organized and on a display at the front of Yume Wo Katare, for each person at the workshop. \u201cHe\u2019s like a librarian,\u201d Shinoda whispered to me. \u201cA dream librarian,\u201d Sara Brande, the restaurant\u2019s brand manager, adds.Yume Wo Katare means \u201cSpeak your dreams\u201d and that concept is encouraged to everyone at the ramen shop, including diners: Once you finish your ramen, the staff yells a \u201cPerfect!\u201d (there\u2019s nothing left), \u201cGood job!\u201d (some noodles and broth remaining), \u201cAlmost!\u201d (you got a whole meal there!), or \u201cNext time!\u201d (well, you get the point). You can order \u201cShare Your Dream\u201d on the menu (for zero dollars) and, after the cooks rank your bowl-cleaning performance, a host will come over and ask if you are ready to announce your goal to everyone in the restaurant. Then, the host will turn off the music and hand over the proverbial mic to you. The dreams can be anything, from \u201csolve global warming by reconstructing the genome DNA in plants and algae\u201d to \u201cvisit San Francisco,\u201d both of which have been proudly framed and hung on the restaurant wall in the past. Later on, after the workshop, Fang explains the connection between the dreams and the noodles: \u201cIf you can finish your bowl, you can achieve your dream.\u201dThe dinner shift at Yume Ga Arukara\nPhoto by Elizabeth CecilReflect On Your DreamsAfter Yume Wo Katare\u2019s success, Nishioka opened Yume Ga Arukara in September 2017, again choosing Cambridge, but this time in a college food court. Here you don\u2019t announce your dream, but he still grades your bowl completion.\u201cGood job!\u201d Nishioka and Shinoda yell in unison as the first two patrons of Yume Ga Arukara nearly finish their bowls at 5:12 p.m. Yume Ga Arukara means \u201cbecause I have dreams.\u201d It\u2019s scrawled in blue on the wall inside the 20-something-seat restaurant, and you\u2019re supposed to complete the sentence yourself. \u201cThe story behind it is if my kids ask me why I work so much, then I can tell them it\u2019s because I have a dream,\u201d Nishioka says, gesturing towards the signage.At 5:37 p.m., Nishioka downs a bowl of udon, the first of his usual four for dinner. For a solid seven minutes, he doesn\u2019t look anywhere. \u201cEvery day it gets better, so I never get tired of it,\u201d he says in between slurps.Shinoda checks the noodles.\nPhoto by Elizabeth CecilBy 5:53 p.m., Shinoda takes out a new blob of dough to start cutting more noodles. The restaurant usually goes through about 50 pounds of noodles on a busy day\u2014nearly 120 after its inclusion in the Hot 10\u2014and tonight is shaping up to be a busier one. The line wavers between 11 and 13 people at a time, forcing the three-person Yume Ga Arukara team to constantly shuffle chairs to accommodate everyone: solo regulars, students showing off their underground find to their families, dates seated side by side and awkwardly figuring out how to talk to each other. Nishioka exhales once everyone is settled in with a bowl in front of them. He seems simultaneously stressed and elated when everyone shuts up and slurps. \u201cI\u2019m still an entertainer,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI like to sit and watch customers enjoy my food.\u201dExpand Your DreamsShortly after I visited, Nishioka moved to Japan with his family, handing off Yume Ga Arukara to Shinoda to oversee in his absence. Though it seems abrupt, it\u2019s not a surprising for a man willing to drop everything to pursue his next big dream. There, he\u2019s training 50 young, eager prospects on how to make Jiro ramen and open their own dream-centric ramen-yas in each of Japan\u2019s 47 prefectures. Yume Wo Katare outposts in Okinawa and Beppu are already up and running along with dream workshops attached to each location. \u201cOnce I achieve that, I\u2019ll come back to Boston,\u201d he says. (However, he will be back this month to celebrate Yume Wo Katare\u2019s sixth anniversary.)By 8:46 p.m. at Yume Ga Arukara, everything is winding down. Nishioka silently guzzles his final bowl of udon. They\u2019ve slung about 95 bowls in the last four hours. He slides the empty bowl in front of him. A Yume Wo Katare regular, sitting with some friends at the counter, looks over and yells \u201cPerfect!\u201dThe Hot 10: America\u2019s Best New Restaurants in 2018The most delicious, exciting, and just plain fun places to eat in America right now.View StoryExplore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsHot 10 2018Read MoreLifestyleThis Cold Udon with Grapefruit Ponzu Is the Only Thing I\u2019ll Eat Until OctoberBy Aliza AbarbanelrestaurantsThe Mysterious and Magical World of Burrow, a Japanese Bakery Hiding In an Office LobbyBy Elyse InaminecookingA Ramen Recipe That's All About That Ginger Scallion SauceBy Andy BaraghaniRecipes you want to make.
