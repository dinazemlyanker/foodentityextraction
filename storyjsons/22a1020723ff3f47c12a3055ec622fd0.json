From plant-based restaurant menus to new products on supermarket shelves to a commitment from the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen to make sure 30 percent of the new recipes developed in house will be meatless, this is the era of plants. As diners, cooks, and lovers of the planet, we\u2019re grateful that they are finally getting their due.To start the morning with some plant love, we\u2019ve been diving into the new Harmless Harvest organic dairy-free coconut yogurt alternative that recently launched at Whole Foods. Made by the brand behind the suspiciously good pink coconut water, these vegan cups come in vanilla speckled with real vanilla beans, lightly tangy plain, and fruity strawberry and blueberry flavors. And they are all ultra smooth and creamy but still light, making a morning meal or afternoon snack feel a touch like dessert, but without all the calories \u2014\u00a0something we are always here for.From Coconut to Breakfast TableWhen Harmless Harvest launched their organic coconut water in 2011, the team searched far and wide for coconuts with the best coconut water, finding and falling for the nam hom (which means \u201cfragrant ones\u201d in Thai) variety. Those coconuts not only produce exceptional coconut water, but also coconut meat \u2014 that\u2019s where Harmless Harvest\u2019s new coconut yogurt alternative comes in as part of the company\u2019s goal to move towards zero-waste; and considering its impact from seed to shelf.After the coconut water is drained from the fruit to be sipped post workout or anytime we need hydration, the creamy meat of the coconut is harvested by hand-scooping, allowing us to upcycle as much of the coconut as possible. The hand-scooped meat is pureed until it\u2019s smooth and luxuriously creamy. Next up: live and active cultures are added and a handful of ingredients like organic strawberries and blueberries, and organic vanilla beans are mixed in before it\u2019s sealed. Nam Hom coconuts result in ultimate creaminess; sans icky gums typically used to thicken plant-based products.Fair for LifeSustainability isn\u2019t just about ingredients. Harmless Harvest knows it\u2019s also about communities, too. It\u2019s a philosophy that is at the core of the company. Their work has been honored with the Fair for Life certification, a third-party that designates companies committed to fair trade and social accountability. And, as the Harmless Harvest team explains on their website: \u201cThis means being diligent in our practices and considering everyone \u2014 and everything \u2014 we affect.\u201dThat includes the communities where they farm and bottle their coconut water and harvest their young Thai coconut meat for these morning pick me ups or afternoon snacks (really, we like them at any hour). The team has invested in water filtration systems, regenerative farming, school uniforms, and mobile medical trucks that offer preventative healthcare like checkups to support and give back to the community they live and work in.Let's Get Cooking: More Than Just a Plain CupWhile we\u2019ve never been mad at a good yogurt or vegan alternative like these newcomers from Harmless Harvest, we also haven\u2019t met one that didn\u2019t get along well with granola. And, in Bon Appetit Test Kitchen star Claire Saffitz\u2019s words, \u201cGranola (Yes, Granola) Is the Greatest Recipe of All Time.\u201d We\u2019re not ones to argue with Claire \u2014 or her mom\u2019s recipe. The recipe brings together rolled oats, raw sunflower seeds, walnuts, wheatgerm and dried fruit like tart cherries into a chewy, crunchy harmony.If granola isn\u2019t your thing, try drizzling date syrup or honey over one of the plain or vanilla cups of Harmless Harvest organic dairy-free coconut yogurt alternative and topping it with whatever nuts or seeds you have on hand for a vegan and gluten free start to the day. Or, layer a cup or two with fresh fruit for a healthy parfait. And, finally, if savory flavors are more your jam, swap the plain flavor in for a traditional yogurt for a creamy crudite dip or dressing. You won\u2019t be sorry.Recipes you want to make.
