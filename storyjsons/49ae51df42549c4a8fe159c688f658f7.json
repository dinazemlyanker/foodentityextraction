You may associate short ribs with slow-cooked preparations, but this recipe is a testament to how tender and flavorful they can be when cooked like a steak. If you can\u2019t find boneless short ribs, a New York strip steak will work here as well.This recipe was adapted from \u2018The Rise: Black Cooks and the Soul of American Food.\u2019Ingredients8 ServingsMarinade2large shallots, coarsely chopped8garlic cloves, peeled2Scotch bonnet chiles, stemsremoved12\" piece ginger, peeled, coarsely chopped\u00bccup fresh lemon juice\u00bccup vegetable oil4tsp. paprika2tsp.
