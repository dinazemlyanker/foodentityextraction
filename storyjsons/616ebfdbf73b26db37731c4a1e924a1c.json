I consider making a weekly pot of rice and greens one of these life skills.This habit caught on at the start of the pandemic, when I needed both starchy comfort and an antidote to starchy comfort. Even better that it was a dish I could make with staples I\u2019d purchased the last time I went to the market, however long ago that was.Rice and greens goes like this: Make rice. However you make rice\u2014in a rice cooker, on the stove, or in the oven\u2014do that. It could be white or brown, short-grain or long-grain. You could even use another grain, like farro, couscous, quinoa, that can be cooked via the absorption method, where the grains fully absorb the liquid.While your rice is cooking, prep one bunch of dark leafy greens, like kale, escarole, mature spinach, or Swiss chard (avoid baby, delicate greens). Remove and compost the stems, then rip the leaves into big pieces.When your rice is done cooking, it needs to rest. Leaving rice to sit after cooking, off the heat and covered, ensures that the moisture redistributes so that all the little grains have a uniform texture. Otherwise, the rice might be mushy on the bottom and dry on top.But while the rice is resting, it can also be multitasking. The steam captured in the pot or rice cooker is hot enough to cook greens (or anything else that steams in 5\u201310 minutes). After taking the rice off the heat, quickly pile the greens on top of the rice and put the lid back on. Rice apparently requires 15 minutes of resting time for perfection, but I usually wait five minutes for good enough. Uncover the pot, season the greens with salt, and then fluff them into the rice. In one pot, ready at once, you\u2019ve got two of cooking\u2019s greatest building blocks, ready to be dressed up and retooled however you see fit.Some weeks I\u2019ll make a pot of rice and greens, add some soy sauce, furikake, maybe (big maybe) an egg, and we have dinner. The next night I might simmer some of the rice and greens with beans and their starchy liquid for soup. And for the last of the batch, I\u2019ll crisp it in a hot skillet, throwing in whatever else needs to go. Other times I\u2019ll make the rice pilaf-style with ground spices and a fat slab of butter, or I\u2019ll add a can of drained chickpeas.Rice and greens has shimmied slyly into my routine, buoying me through the day, shifting based on what I\u2019m craving and what ingredients I have on hand. Its benevolence is quiet and fierce. Even at my least creative, white rice and kale steaming together in a pot felt\u2014feels!\u2014comforting, dependable, essential. This is a life skill for which I am truly grateful.Ali Slagle is a recipe developer, stylist, and writer.
