Instead of letting them duke it out, we let the two wax poetic about this one particular deli in Vermont. Here\u2019s that conversation.Amanda Shapiro: So when I was a kid, my family would drive from Connecticut to Vermont to visit my grandparents, and almost every time we\u2019d stop at this shop with a name I never knew because I just called it \u201cthe dip chicken place.\u201d Turns out, it was the Vermont Country Deli in Brattleboro, VT\u2014and there\u2019s so much more to it than chicken.Aliza Abarbanel: So cute! So East Coast. I went for the first time two years ago on Labor Day. I was heading to Vermont for the first time and you told me to stop there. But wait, what\u2019s dip chicken? I\u2019m scared to even ask...AS: It\u2019s like sesame chicken, the battered and fried kind you\u2019d see on a Chinese takeout menu, but served cold, straight from the deli case. Does that not sound delicious to you? Trust me, it is.AA: But...how is it a dip?!  And what were you dipping in it anyway?AS: Don\u2019t ask too many questions, Aliza. Tell the people about the sandos.AA: The sandwiches! Okay, honestly I\u2019m usually not a big sandwich person, probably because of my low-key dislike of deli meat. But I fell hard for the Vermont Veggie, a careful construction of pickles, sprouts, and generous hunks of Cabot cheddar on pillowy slices of marbled rye layered with hummus and honey mustard (my forever fave). Then I laid eyes on the Route 9 Roast Beef: a leaning tower of cheddar, tomatoes, and roast beef jolted with horseradish sauce. Truly, it was awe-inspiring, and just what a car of slightly hungover, very hungry people needed to be able to power through the six hour drive back to Brooklyn.AS: Hope you didn\u2019t forget a giant cookie from the incredible dessert case.AA: Oh, we got three. Two communal chocolate chip cookies for the car, and one peanut butter cookie that I refused to share with anyone. Plus a few bottles of Fable Farm cider, goat milk caramels, and every other Vermont-y snack you\u2019d imagine.AS: Right. The place is stocked to the nines with Vermont-made stuff, but not the hokey kind. So much craft beer. The best maple candy. Local honey. Walpole ice cream. Champlain Valley cider. Even the coffee comes from a local roastery.AA: I still can\u2019t believe we skipped the dip chicken.AS: Just another reason to go back.Go there: Vermont Country DeliExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendVermontRead MorecultureThe Best NYC Day Trip Is to a Japanese Grocery Store in New JerseyBy Rachel KartenRecipes you want to make.
