Didn't use collards, just used more kale and chard to make up for them. My husband is allergic to shellfish so I subbed in a combo of Vegemite and fish sauce for the shrimp paste. Awesome side dishKatieChattanooga, TN2/10/2022Yummy! It was hard to gauge how big of a \u201cbunch\u201d to use for each green- I ended up using about half the gigantic bunch of kale. My supermarket is limited so I couldn\u2019t get collards or the right chiles, but I subbed broccoli rabe for the collards and they worked well (did a quick blanch to make less bitter). As someone else mentioned, I was nervous about adding some many chiles (I used 1/2 a poblano and 2 jalape\u00f1os) and had to add in more jalape\u00f1os later to get more kick.MargotHollis, ME5/2/2021Made these greens to go with the adobo chicken and garlic rice, as shown in the magazine.  Delicious!  I will say, this is easily more like 8 servings, not 4 - but the leftovers were great too.  I went ahead and used all 8 peppers in the saut\u00e9, but squeezed the seeds out of most so my 10 year old wouldn't think it was too hot.  Turned out perfectly.  Glad I stopped at a specialty Asian market for the saut\u00e9ed shrimp paste, as it added a huge depth of flavor to a simple dish.  Definitely will do again!LBinTXTexas3/25/2021I'm amazed at how such a simple recipe can have such exquisite depth of flavor. And uses all of those greens! It's so tasty you forget how healthy you're being. Great paired with jasmine rice. I was afraid of all those chiles so I only used one, but it wasn't spicy at all so next time I'll be braver and try a few more.
