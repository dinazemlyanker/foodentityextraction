Really think about it. Pause and reflect. This is the hot-skillet issue Molly Baz took on when she developed five new dinner recipes that give breakfast-for-dinner the respect it deserves. I would call them restaurant quality recipes, because I\u2019d pay good money for them with unlimited cups of coffee, but that also implies difficulty. And they\u2019re not.Take, for example, this phenomenal merguez and egg wrap. There are a few individual components here that all come together in the most delicious lavash package: crispy sausage up against jammy hard-boiled egg up against garlicky yogurt up against acidic pickles and onion. And if that isn\u2019t enough, the whole damn wrap then gets griddled in the reserved merguez fat, causing crispy edges and extra sausage flavor while everything inside melds together. MOLLY, YOU BEAUTIFUL BASTARD. THANK YOU.My assembly station was not this tidy, but how aspirational!\nPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Sue Li, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiHere\u2019s how to make it happen on a desperate and dark Monday night:Boil some water, drop in some eggs. For only 8 minutes, people. We want bright orange, slightly soft yolks, not hard and dried-out yolks. (Honestly that\u2019s a personal preference, you do you.)While the water\u2019s coming to a boil for the eggs, mix up some yogurt. With lemon juice, salt and pep, grated garlic.Maybe the eggs are still boiling. Get on that merguez. First, brown the sausage meat in patties for maximum crispy-edged potential. When the pan-side has browned, flip the patties over and then break up the sausage into morsels as the other side cooks through.Slice some stuff. The eggs, red onion, pickles, herbs.Assemble your masterpiece. Swoosh that yogurt all over, leaving some room at the edges. Layer on sausage, layer on eggs, layer on the pickles, onion, and herbs. Wrap it up tight. Unless you got small tortillas or flatbreads like I did, in which case, make a taco, you did your best.The grand finale. This THREE MINUTE extra step yields the greatest breakfast-for-dinner reward, so please DO IT. Heat up that pan again, the one with the merguez fat shimmering and ready for duty, and plop the wrap in, don\u2019t even touch it, until it\u2019s crispy on one side, then flip and repeat. (If your wrap is too small, I highly recommend still frying it open-faced anyway.)Slice and eat. Hopefully by now you\u2019re in your comfy pants, unfolding the TV tray, and settling in for the best breakfast-for-dinner you\u2019ve ever had. From now on, don\u2019t settle for less.Get the recipe:Egg and Merguez WrapsIt\u2019s a wrap griddled in sausage fat until the outside is crispy and warm.
