But beer is too filling and soda is for kids! That\u2019s where sparkling wine comes in. Sparkling wine and pizza go together like Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga, which is to say, they go together perfectly. And there\u2019s one in particular that\u2019s become the non plus ultra for pairing in my book: a not-too-sweet lambrusco made by Gianna Storchi in Emilia Romagna, Italy, called Pozzoferrato. The first time I tried it was at Scarr\u2019s, the old-school pizza spot that mills its own flour to the tune of throwback hip-hop in New York\u2019s Lower East Side. As I made my way down the list of Hennessy Coladas and cheap beer, I stumbled upon something listed as a \u201cRed Pet Nat.\u201d So I ordered it\u2014and have every visit since. Nothing beats its clean finish, which will please Two Buck Chuck folks and natty wine freaks alike. And of course, there\u2019s that gratifying effervescence that also feels celebratory, even if it\u2019s just a Tuesday night in the back of a slice shop. It\u2019s so good, I won\u2019t eat pizza without it\u2014or at least something just like it. Can\u2019t find the bottle? Just ask your favorite wine shop for help finding other lambrusco that fit the bill: not-overly-sweet, unfiltered, and absolutely perfect with a slice.Learn more: Storchi, \u201dPozzoferrato,\u201d Reggiano Rosso DOCExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendWineShoppingRecipes you want to make.
