Named for \u201cthe most stable form of cocoa-butter crystallization,\u201d Beta5 began by producing chocolate bars and confections, but its creations have expanded to include a line of ethereal cream puffs and weekend experiments in pastry and ice cream.ORDER THE: noodle bar (actually a chocolate bar) with togarashi-spiced peanuts and ramen noodles; mango-passion fruit caramels; Vietnamese coffee cream puff; and whatever special weekend creation they\u2019re featuring, like raspberry-orange brioche ice cream sandwiches and sundaes simply titled Disco.THE VIBE IS: clinical-like but in a good way. It is a fine curated chocolate lab with an all-white sparkling-clean space and a product lineup that changes often. Peek through the windows in the back of Beta5 to watch the team of pastry wizards at work.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Tuesday to Friday, from 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; and Saturday and Sunday, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Closed Monday.\u2014Lindsay AndersonLuis ValdizonBETA5 ChocolatesWE ALSO LOVEBeaucoupAn outstanding bakery worth the (slight) trek to KitsilanoBurdock & Co.A Mount Pleasant go-to that shows off the best of British Columbia33 Acres BreweryCalifornia meets the Pacific Northwest and the result is this breezy Mount Pleasant breweryExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
