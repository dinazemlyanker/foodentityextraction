But how does it taste?By Alyse WhitneyFebruary 1, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailCourtesy of Hangar 1FacebookTwitterEmailIf every Friday night you ask yourself: \"Should I have a glass of ros\u00e9 or a vodka soda?\" then we have great news for you. Hangar 1 combined your two vices into ros\u00e9 vodka, meaning all of your cocktails can be millennial pink and you can have ros\u00e9 shots all day (well, maybe don't). The latest iteration of the trend brings a little summer to the dead of winter, hitting stores today (February 1) for $32.Unlike W\u00f6lffer Estate's ros\u00e9 gin, Hangar 1's ros\u00e9 vodka actually tastes like ros\u00e9. When we sipped some straight, it was \"less sharp than a standard vodka\" and had an \"appealing roundness of flavor with a bit of crisp fruitiness and floral notes.\" It goes down smooth with a faint bubblegum-like aftertaste, and has more body than a lot of vodka we've tried. The best description is that it tastes exactly like it sounds: ros\u00e9 with higher proof from vodka, or vodka watered down slightly with ros\u00e9.Hangar 1 head distiller Caley Shoemaker used grapes and grains to distill the vodka and combined it with a blend of Northern California Petit Verdot and White Meritage wines for a \"full-bodied, flavor-forward vodka inspired by the Bay Area.\" It took a little time to find the right blend with a local winery, but the result was a smoother vodka with a vibrant color. \"It smells like Burnett's pink lemonade vodka and tastes... pink,\" remarked one Bon App\u00e9tit staffer. But definitely much better than anything we drank in college.It wouldn't hurt to add more booze to your ros\u00e9-Aperol spritz...\nLaura MurrayRos\u00e9 vodka can make \"the most basic vodka soda,\" a higher proof ros\u00e9-Aperol spritz or fros\u00e9, spiked lemonade at a picnic, or a shot that doesn't burn going down. Also ideal for a Bachelor-watching drinking game during rose ceremonies, or as a last-minute Valentine's Day gift when all the actual roses are sold out.Buy Hangar 1 ros\u00e9 vodka for $32 online at Reserve BarThen make ros\u00e9-Aperol spritzes:Explore Bon App\u00e9titRoseVodkaCocktailAlcohol & Other DrinksWineTrends + NewsShoppingTrendsRead MorecultureRos\u00e9 Gin Is Here, But Does It Taste Like Ros\u00e9?By Alex BeggscultureThe Ros\u00e9-Aperol Spritz Is Your Drink of SummerBy Alex Beggscooking5 Ros\u00e9 Cocktails to Keep the Summer Water ComingBy Alex DelanyRecipes you want to make.
