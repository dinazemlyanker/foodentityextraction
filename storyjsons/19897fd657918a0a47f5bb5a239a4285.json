When something\u2019s so easy to make that you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.As a descendent of Lithuanian immigrants, sour cream runs through my veins. Eastern Europeans are known for their love of dairy. In Simon Bajada\u2019s Cookbook Baltic, he writes, \u201cOf all the exceptional produce celebrated within the region, the Baltic love of dairy cannot be overstated.\u201d My family is no exception.Cream cheese, sour cream, farmer\u2019s cheese, cottage cheese, and butter have always had a welcome seat at the table. A tub of sour cream was always within arm\u2019s reach of my great-grandmother\u2019s pierogi, a welcome dollop of tang to cut through the dumplings\u2019 richness, and one of my go-to after school snacks was a fruit dip made by mixing sour cream with brown sugar.But running concurrently with my love of all things dairy is the great, cruel irony that\u2019s plagued me ever since that first spoonful: I\u2019m lactose intolerant. Cue the tiny violin. Growing up, I pushed through the gastrointestinal discomfort and all its unpleasant side effects, but as I\u2019ve gotten older, the ol\u2019 stomach can\u2019t handle the same quantities of dairy goodness it used to. And coupled with the moral weight of being an environmental reporter, let\u2019s just say I have good reason to cut back on dairy.Andy Baraghani\u2019s vegan creamed spinach uses a slightly different technique but has just as great a result.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Yekaterina BoytsovaBut it hasn\u2019t been easy. What\u2019s a bowl of chili without a dollop of sour cream? How can you make good pierogi without farmer\u2019s cheese? While I remain stumped for adequate solutions to these dilemmas, I have stumbled upon a way to emulate the luxurious goodness of creamed vegetables\u2014think spinach, mushrooms, or even poblano rajas\u2014without dairy or even vegan cheese products.I happened upon the magic combination\u2014coconut milk, miso, and nutritional yeast\u2014by accident. My cousin and his girlfriend were moving to the West Coast and decided to clean out their pantry predeparture. I was gifted some low-salt salad dressings, sugar-free chocolate chips, and a shakerful of nutritional yeast (a.k.a. nooch). The salad dressings and sugar-free chocolate are still collecting dust in my pantry, but, when mixed with saut\u00e9ed alliums, coconut milk, and miso, that nooch makes a cheesy, creamy (vegan) sauce for vegetables.It\u2019s simple: Over medium heat, saut\u00e9 1 thinly sliced small onion or large shallot in 1 Tbsp. coconut oil until soft and golden, about 10 minutes. Whisk in 2 tsp. white miso and 2 tsp. nutritional yeast\u2014you\u2019re creating a sort of \u201croux\u201d of flavor here; if it looks a little dry, add another tablespoon of coconut oil. Add 2\u00bd to 3 cups of your favorite greens (or other vegetables), and cook, stirring, until starting to wilt, about 4 minutes. Stir in \u00be cup coconut milk (I like Aroy-D because it\u2019s creamy and doesn\u2019t separate), salt, and pepper, and simmer over medium heat for about 5 minutes, or until about a quarter of the coconut milk has evaporated (the mixture should become thick, creamy, and pale brown).You can swap out the greens for mushrooms to make a vegan stroganoff-ish sauce (add a teaspoon of soy sauce for depth), or for roasted poblano strips to make a vegan take on rajas con crema (add 1 tsp. each cumin and chili powder).Even if they invent some magical way (sorry, lactose pills don\u2019t count) for lactose-intolerant folks to eat creamy, cheesy dishes without gastric distress, I\u2019d still have my shaker of nooch at the ready for this versatile vegan cream sauce.Grace Kelly is a journalist and recipe developer based in Rhode Island.
