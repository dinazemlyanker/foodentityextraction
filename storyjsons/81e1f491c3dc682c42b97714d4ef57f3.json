Here\u2019s what you need to know, and the cans to buy.By Alex DelanyNovember 14, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailWhat would it take for me to like a canned cocktail? That\u2019s a question I\u2014a human being who very much enjoys making, drinking, and toting can-less cocktails\u2014have been asking myself a lot lately. If you\u2019ve been paying attention to the shelves at your liquor store, millennial-targeted TV spots, or Instagram advertising campaigns, you\u2019ve probably noticed that there are a ton of canned cocktails entering the market right now. Maybe you\u2019ve even tried a few. But after months of asking myself that question on repeat, I decided to find out.So a group of BA editors got together to taste through many different canned cocktail flavors from many different canned cocktail companies. And while we did, we kept three questions in mind: Is this good? Does it hold up to its original? And most importantly, Would I recommend it to a friend? In the end, we came away with a short list of specific cans that we felt fit the bill, as well as three essential takeaways:Still (not bubbly), juice-less canned cocktails tend to be more truthful to their can-less iterations. Across the board, cocktails that included only liquor and some sweetening agent tasted closer to the real-world version of the cocktail than cocktails with carbonation or other non-booze ingredients. Basically, the less going on\u2014like in an Old Fashioned or a Manhattan\u2014the less of a chance it\u2019s going to taste terrible.Canned cocktails with citrus juice post a higher risk. Fresh citrus juice is one of nature\u2019s most brilliant flavors. But the longer it sits, the worse it tastes. Bright, tart notes can quickly turn to soapy, bitter, drink-ruining ones. If you\u2019re buying a canned cocktail with big citrus flavors, like a Paloma or a Margarita, do so with caution.Just because it looks cute, doesn\u2019t mean it tastes...cute. There are a lot of canned cocktail companies that have figured out how to brand and market a canned cocktail. There are far fewer that have learned how to actually make a good one. Don\u2019t be fooled by cute illustrations, unless you\u2019re just buying cans with the sole intent of keeping them on your photogenic bar cart.Okay. You\u2019ve taken notes. Good. Here are the canned cocktails we loved the most from the brands we felt delivered consistently across their respective portfolios:Photo by Alex LauTip Top Old FashionedTip Top\u2019s canned version of the classic whiskey-sugar-bitters cocktail was developed by Miles Macquarrie of Kimball House in Georgia. The can hits the stiff, simple, whiskey-forward note with a subtle touch of orange, derived from bitters, not citrus juice. This is equal parts grandpa\u2019s study and trusty dive bar. Which is exactly what you want from an Old Fashioned.Photo by Alex LauBelle Isle Blood Orange Moonshine and SodaIf you\u2019re thinking of light, refreshing, spritzy flavor, you might not be thinking of moonshine. But this Richmond, VA based distillery delivers one of the cleanest canned cocktails we tried. And while it does have citrus flavor, it comes from the blood orange moonshine, not fresh citrus juice, which means you don\u2019t get any bitter, soapy flavors. Just clean fruit and energetic bubbles, not unlike a vodka soda.Photo by Alex LauCardinal Spirits Vodka SodaIndiana-based Cardinal Spirits goes one step simpler with a vodka soda that\u2019s just house-distilled vodka and sparkling water. While you could certainly drink this straight-up, we loved it with the addition of fresh juice. A spritz of grapefruit, orange, lime, or lemon all work nicely. Though a bit of tropical fruit puree or some muddled berries probably wouldn\u2019t be too bad either.Photo by Alex LauSlalom Fox Colorado MuleDitch the festive copper mug, and just drink this mule right out of the can. The ginger flavor from the syrup is clean and spicy. The lime juice holds it\u2019s brightness. And the bourbon provides a layer of deep, warm flavor that makes this Colorado-made mule perfect for a fall afternoon spent on a mountain or a boulder or a small rock\u2014or maybe just a slab of cement in your driveway.Photo by Alex LauPampellone French 75All of Pampellone\u2019s canned cocktails are made with a sparkling wine base, and while they don\u2019t quite adhere to the classic versions of the cocktails in terms of ingredients, they absolutely deliver on flavor. The French 75 doesn\u2019t have any gin, but it is hit with Meyer lemon and elderflower, which lend a citrusy, botanical backbone that gets lifted up with sparkling acidity from the wine. If you\u2019re into a spritz, this is your move.Photo by Alex LauCutwater Spirits MargaritaMaking a good margarita is incredibly easy. Making a great one is tougher than you\u2019d think. Making a great canned margarita is another thing entirely. It\u2019s all about balance, and Cutwater\u2019s floral-forward, house tequila, cane sugar, lime juice, and barely noticeable touch of orange flavor run in perfect harmony. We\u2019d recommend dipping the lip of the can in a bit of water and rolling it in some salt before opening. Just because your drink comes in a pop top doesn\u2019t mean you should skimp on the proper finishing touches.Photo by Alex LauEmpirical Spirits Minor ThreatRemember when I said the more complicated the cocktail, the more risky the flavor? Well, turns out that\u2019s not the case when the cocktail is from Empirical Spirits. This Copenhagen-based distillery uses their Koji spirit\u2014made from barley koji, pilsner malt, and saison yeast (yeah, pretty cool)\u2014as alcoholic component in this canned cocktail. Each release of Minor Threat has a different flavor profile, but whether it\u2019s laced with tart rhubarb, jasmine tea, and orange blossom like the fruity, acidic, floral iteration above or runs with notes of oolong milk tea and gooseberry like its predecessor, Empirical\u2019s limited-edition offerings have the best chance of blowing your mind.Want a...bottled cocktail?
