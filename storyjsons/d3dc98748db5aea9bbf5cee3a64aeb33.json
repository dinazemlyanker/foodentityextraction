Slow-roast a single large fish fillet instead of making several small ones\u2014it ensures that the fish is buttery and delicious. Vegetables that are best served crisp-tender are a great accompaniment because they'll be perfectly cooked by the time the fish is finished.Ingredients6\u20138 servings2bunches asparagus, trimmed, halved lengthwise if thick, divided6Tbsp. unsalted butter7Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided1tsp.

I used some beautiful fresh red snapper and followed everything else to a tee. Perfectly cooked and subtly flavoured. We generally use fan forced ovens here in oz but thanks to bon appetit I have discovered a whole new world of cooking without using the fan. It keeps things so moist and tender. An amazing an easy dinner!!Miranda Perth, Western Australia3/26/2022Holy moly- BEST. Halibut. Ever. What an amazing recipe!!! Couldn\u2019t find ramps so used organic green onions- delish. I don\u2019t like tarragon so used fresh Basil instead. Our guests were very impressed. This recipe is a keeper. Don\u2019t question any further, just make this. You\u2019ll love it! JMFort Worth, Texas 3/13/2022Fantastic dish.  Used a bit of fennel instead of tarragon.  Visually lovely and great texture and flavor.  Definitely a keeper. Dmanf3/29/2021Delicious. I did not have Aleppo pepper or tarragon, so I used paprika and ground red pepper and for herbs, I used lemon thyme and rosemary. I did roast the potatoes with the fish. I will make this again.AnonymousNew York11/7/2020The butter with the Aleppo pepper was amazing! I also added some prawns. Tasted excellent. AnonymousTacoma, WA4/29/2020Wonderful!\nAnonymousPortugal4/24/2020Excellent recipe.  Used a thick filet of cod, substituted 1leek instead of the ramps, and skipped the olives. Both fish and vegetables were perfectly done, and the chives and tarragon made for terrific flavor.AnonymousMassachusetts 1/12/2020I've made this twice, successfully both times. The second time I cut the asparagus and spring onions in 2\" pieces, making it easier to serve, though not as lovely. My sister-in-law, a former restaurant owner, said it was wonderful.  I like when a relatively easy dish is spectacular. Next time halibut is on sale, it might make the menu again.ebappelThe Hudson Valley, New York7/2/2019This was so good! I went with cod instead of halibut, red pepper flakes instead of aleppo pepper, and scallions instead of ramps. And it. Was. Delicious. (And a lot cheaper) You can save time if you do all of the topping/ salad prep while the fish roasts. mhdsileskyAustin, TX6/7/2019To \"Anonymous\" in Denver - the recipe is not crystal clear, but the asparagus coins are made from one-quarter of the entire amount of asparagus that you have.  BTW - the coins are raw which was an interesting departure but quite nice.diane oronaPasadena, California5/22/2019Delicious and really easy!! Highly recommend. I was short a couple ingredients and subbed thinly sliced scallions for the chives and dill for the tarragon, but it was super easy and very tasty. Bought baby potatoes and roasted those at the same time as the fish in a separate sheet pan tossed with EVOO+ salt/pepper, would repeat (or do same pan as the fish if I had the space). 5/22/2019\"Thinly slice one-quarter of asparagus into coins and place in a medium bowl; set aside.\" I sliced one quarter of one asparagus stalk, and I'm pretty sure it wasn't right. XD This is good stuff though! I didn't change anything and I don't think that I would, except maybe spice the potatoes up somehow.
