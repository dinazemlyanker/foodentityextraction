RossOctober 14, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailThis wine calculator is part of The New Rules of Dinner Parties, a new collection of advice, recipes, and perspectives on one of the things we\u2019ve missed the most. Read all the stories here.How much wine is \u201cenough\u201d wine for your dinner party? Here\u2019s a handy drink calculator for you\u2014actually, it\u2019s solely a wine calculator. Most people would say that the dinner is the most important part of a dinner party, but I would argue it\u2019s having enough wine. It starts conversations, complements dishes (you didn\u2019t burn), and keeps the party going. You can pull a Tim Allen and turn a turkey into a wildfire, and no one will care if there are plenty of bottles to go around.How many glasses are in a bottle of wine?To start, you need to know how many glasses are in a bottle of wine. This seems obvious, but considering we\u2019ve all had nights where a whole bottle of red\u00a0wine equals two very large mason jars of Cab Franc while hate-watching Love Actually, it\u2019s important to break it down.A bottle of wine is 750 milliliters, which works out to approximately 25 ounces. The suggested serving size of wine is five ounces, which would mean each bottle has five glasses. If you want to stick to that math, that is perfectly fine, although, personally, I don\u2019t believe five ounces is a glass of wine. I think it\u2019s a joke. Who pours exactly five ounces of wine? No one. If you work from the five-glasses-per-bottle logic, you almost always come up short. According to my very professional opinion, a 750-ml bottle of wine works out to be about four glasses of wine, and two chugs straight from the bottle you are awarded as the dinner party host.What's that funky orange wine they\u2019re drinking?

The average glass of wine contains around 11% to 13% alcohol. But you might serve a bottle containing 5.5% ABV (might be a sparkling wine or a ros\u00e9) or over 20% ABV (probably a sherry or port). It depends. If a wine has higher degrees Brix, or sugar levels, it will usually have higher alcohol levels. It\u2019s got to do with what kind of grapes are used in the fermentation process during winemaking.So how many bottles of wine do you need for your party?Okay, back to the main topic. Using the above information, I say you need at least one bottle of wine per guest. Think about it\u2014you have a glass before dinner, a few at dinner, another after dinner. Boom, that\u2019s a bottle right there, and that\u2019s being conservative. But that\u2019s just me, and it\u2019s not my dinner party. To find out exactly how many bottles you need, we\u2019re going to do a liiiittle math.Since you already know how many glasses are in a bottle of wine, there are two other variables you must know in order to solve this ancient and universal equation.First, how many guests are coming?Check the group text and count \u2019em up. Always add two extra people because you never know who is going to surprise you with a new boyfriend or when that notoriously flaky friend you still love and always invite will actually show up.Second, how many glasses of wine will each guest drink?None of us here are psychic, but we can use this chart I made to predict how many glasses of wine your guests will consume based upon the duration of your dinner party and their love of wine.We're definitely not talking about bottles of beer here.\nBy Marissa A. RossOkay, so what is the formula for the number of bottles of wine?\u00a0Pull out your phone\u2019s calculator app (or, uh, an actual calculator) and do this math:\u00a0Number of Guests \u00d7 Number of Estimated Glasses Per Guest \u00f7 4 = Number of Bottles NeededAnd voil\u00e1! Glasses will be full, guests will be happy, and you won\u2019t run out of wine and haphazardly open that bottle you\u2019ve been saving with a note attached that says, \u201cDON\u2019T OPEN ME, YOU\u2019RE DRUNK!\u201d Cause you will regret that shit.This story was originally published December 5, 2017.The One Dish for Every Dinner Party:Explore Bon App\u00e9titWinePartyDinner PartiesEntertainingRead MorecultureThere's No Place Like Lou Wine ShopBy Marissa A.
