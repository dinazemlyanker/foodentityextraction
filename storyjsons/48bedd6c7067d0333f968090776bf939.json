Curious, I grabbed a bag of original tempura flavor, popped it open, and started passing it around to my colleagues. Next came a wave of audible crrrrrunches, and then a bunch of gasps. These potato-chip-sized, tempura-fried, salty-sweet pieces of roasted seaweed coated in white pepper, cane sugar, and onion and garlic powders were the best seaweed snacks we had ever tried.\u201cIt has the addictiveness of snacking on cereal\u2014but it is salty which makes it even more addictive!\u201d said contributing editor Priya Krishna.\u201cThese are one of those snacks that\u2019s probably not as healthy as I think it is but addictive enough that I don\u2019t care, like, at all,\u201d associate editor Hilary Cadigan concurred.In three minutes flat, the first bag was gone.The \u201cspicy\u201d version just has a little heat from chili powder.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigSo we opened the next one. This \u201cspicy\u201d version came coated in the same tempura shell, dusted with a little chili powder. With the pleasant kick still lingering on the back of our tongues, we dubbed this the best bar snack you could have anywhere, anytime.\u201cGenerally I think seaweed snacks taste like snacking on the ocean\u2019s socks\u2014the brine is overwhelming, and the flavor is all of the worst parts of chard: dirty, wilted, lifeless,\u201d lamented associate editor Alex Delany. \u201cBut apparently, if you toss them in tempura batter and season them with a salty, sweet, and spicy powder, they taste amazing.\u201dThese double-stacked seaweed strips are fried like chips, so they have a satisfying crunch.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigThen we noticed a third bag: simple nori strips\u2014the closest relative to the little plastic tubs of dried, roasted seaweed snacks you\u2019ve probably seen before. But these were thicker, less delicate, crispier, and flash fried\u2014and in turn, very easy to eat a lot of. And so we did.\u201cI like that the strip are more substantial than the standard seaweed snacks,\u201d said features editor Meryl Rothstein. \u201cI love those, but I usually plow through an entire pack without satiating my hunger. These taste similar but actually fill me up.\u201dThen they were gone too, and we mourned the loss of such delicious snacks.Up close and personal with the seaweed strips!\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigUntil a week later, when a big box of each flavor arrived. People hoarded bags at their desks, smuggled them home, some even went so far as to share them with other people. And so the addiction spread.\u201cI couldn\u2019t stop eating hunks of crispy, flavorful curls\u2014bags and bags and bags,\u201d admitted e-commerce assistant Zoe Sessums. \u201cI snacked on them at work, I snacked on them when cooking, I sometimes even threw them on a soups and scrambles. I knew I needed to cut myself off, so I gave a few bags to a friend. He texted me one day to say, \u2018They\u2019re like if pork rinds were a dead plant.\u2019 That kind of perfectly describes them.\u201dCall them the chicharr\u00f3nes of the sea. Call them algae rinds. Call them whatever you want\u2014just get your own bag. We\u2019re not sharing any more of ours.Buy it: Nora Seaweed Snacks, 3 Flavor Variety Pack (Pack of 12), $40 on AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
