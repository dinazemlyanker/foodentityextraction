If you think that dinner must consist of a thoughtfully balanced plate of protein, vegetables, and carbohydrates, feel free to show yourself out. If you're the type of person who gets bored of eating perfectly-sauced chicken wing after perfectly-sauced chicken wing, this article is not for you. I\u2019m sorry. I could only write so many crowd-pleasers before getting around to Chicken Wing Dinner.Alex, I recently heard you mention Chicken Wing Dinner. I\u2019m very hungry and exhausted from living my life everyday. Plus, it\u2019s Rent Week, so my wallet is on the lighter side of the spectrum. Could Chicken Wing Dinner work for me? Could you please tell me more?Of course. Of course! Chicken Wing Dinner is where you eat baked chicken wings\u2014and only chicken wings\u2014for dinner. It\u2019s pretty spectacular, especially when the wings we\u2019re talking about are some miso-sambal wings. Interested in flavorful, affordable pieces of chicken you can eat with your hands? Yes? Great. Throw on this playlist of Just Some Good Tunes (completely free of charge) that I made for you and grab those chicken wings from the fridge.Let\u2019s make a marinade! You need brown sugar, fresh ginger, sambal oelek (or another hot chile paste), unseasoned rice vinegar, soy sauce, and red miso. If you don\u2019t have red miso, white miso will be fine, and if you don\u2019t have rice vinegar, you can substitute white vinegar at a slightly reduced amount.In a large bowl, mix \u00bd cup rice vinegar, \u00bc cup soy sauce, and \u2153 cup sambal oelek. Whisk in \u2153 cup brown sugar, \u00bc cup red miso, and 1 Tbsp. freshly grated ginger. (Use a Microplane for that grated ginger.) Add 3 lbs. of chicken wings\u2014a mix of flats and drums, ideally\u2014into the marinade and toss to coat. This should be between 25-30 wings\u2014enough for Chicken Wing Dinner for two, or one extremely hungry person with leftovers. Let the wings hang out in the sauce for about 15 minutes.Chicken wings, being chicken wings.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigIn the meantime, line a rimmed sheet pan with aluminum foil. After 15 minutes have passed, take the wings out of the bowl, spreading them across the tin foil. Leave the excess marinade in the bowl and save it. We\u2019ll come back for that.Now we need to leave the wings, uncovered, in the fridge for at least an hour. This will remove some moisture from the skin, making it easier to get them crispy in the oven. You can do this for as long as a day, if you want, but we\u2019ll err on the side of hungry and do it for an hour. I know. You have to deal with yourself for an hour. You can find something to do. I know that you can. You can listen to Anderson .Paak\u2019s album Malibu from start to finish. That\u2019s a groovy hour. You can walk four miles at a 15-minute per mile pace. That\u2019s a healthy hour. You can count to 60, 60 times. That\u2019s a pointless hour. Wow. Look. The skin on the wings has lost moisture. Let\u2019s put them in the oven you preheated to 425\u00b0.Bake the wings on your foil-lined sheet pan for 30-40 minutes, flipping them over halfway through. The goal is to develop some serious browning on the outside of these guys.This is what we're working towards.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigWhile the wings bake, we\u2019ll turn our attention back to the marinade. This is the real value we\u2019re getting from this whole ordeal. We\u2019re going to turn that into the sauce that we toss the crispy wings in. WHOA! OKAY. DON'T FREAK OUT\u2014WE\u2019RE GONNA COOK IT! I KNOW THERE WAS RAW CHICKEN IN THERE. Jeez. Calm down. We take that leftover marinade and transfer it to a small saucepan. Heat the marinade over high heat. Once it starts to boil, turn the heat to low and let it simmer until the volume reduces by about half. This should take 8-10 minutes. You want it to be thicker than it was, but not syrupy.When the wings are cooked through, remove them from the oven, and turn on your broiler.Yes, your broiler. Maybe it lives on the top of your oven or in a weird drawer on the bottom of it, where you store those two cookbooks your aunt gave you for your birthday three years ago. Regardless, I want to assure you that your broiler is not scary. It\u2019s a magical kitchen appliance that will crisp these chicken wings to tastefully-charred perfection. Place the tray of wings under the broiler for about 3 minutes. Remove the tray, flip the wings, and put them back under the broiler for another 3 minutes. Every broiler is different, so keep an eye on them. We want some very dark, crispy bits of the skin, but no one likes a lump of chicken charcoal. Let them rest for 5 minutes after the second broiler session comes to a close.The toss is all in the wrist. You have to get that flick down pat.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigTime to toss those wings in sauce! The wing-tossing approach is important. I cannot overstate this. It involves precise technique, like changing a tire or a diaper, only instead of the consequence of failure involving a car accident or things not smelling great, you end up with soggy wings. All that crispiness we worked for...gone. Wasted. Donezo. The most important thing is only tossing as many wings as you intend to serve or eat in a sitting. If you\u2019re going to eat five wings and then eat another five wings an hour and a half later, toss the first five, finish eating them, and then toss the second five. And when we toss, we don\u2019t want to drown them in sauce. Place the wings in a large bowl, and then drizzle just a bit of sauce over them. You can always add more sauce while tossing, but you can\u2019t take any away.Does this sound obsessive? Like I care too much? I don\u2019t know. How about you try it, eat your crispy, sauced wings, and get back to me. And if you feel the need to eat something other than wings for dinner, keep it simple. Maybe a pot of steamed white rice or some cabbage slaw. If you want a sprinkle of sliced scallions or some sesame seeds on top, go for it. Maybe a little lime juice, if you have one in the fridge. But don\u2019t turn this into something else.Chicken Wing Dinner is not about sideline distractions. It\u2019s not about a menu. It\u2019s not about balance or health or variety.Chicken Wing Dinner is about focus. It\u2019s about happiness. And it\u2019s about chicken wings.Fine, you want something other than wings?
