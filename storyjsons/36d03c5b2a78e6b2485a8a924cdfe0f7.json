(See binchotan-grilled octopus with a constellation of heirloom potatoes and olives tucked beneath young sorrel leaves.)ORDER: all of the pasta; grilled octopus; red prawns with romaine; and anything wild and gamy (the chef and co-owner Marco Cappelletti  loves to hunt).THE VIBE IS: dark and a little scruffy at first glance, but the incredibly friendly Marcon and Cappelletti have a serious fine-dining background, so everyone feels well cared for. Natural-wine groupies can be seen poring over Marcon's list at the bar. Open late and good for groups\u2014two rarities in Copenhagen\u2014this place gets fun on weekends and is often a final stop for local chefs.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open for dinner Wednesday to Sunday, from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. Closed Monday and Tuesday.\u2014Christine MuhlkePhoto by Ditte IsagerPhoto by Ditte IsagerWE ALSO LOVECaf\u00e9 Atelier SeptemberThe breezy Indre By caf\u00e9 that\u2019s turned avocado toast into an art formAdmiralgade 26Make yourself at home, if home\u2019s got smoked duck hearts, at this styled-out Indre By spotDemocratic CoffeeOne more reason to love the library (or at least this Indre By one): buttery croissantsExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
