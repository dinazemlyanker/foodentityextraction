As a writer, a social worker, and a Black woman, I have been given countless gifts to contribute to this world and yet, I felt stuck.I struggled to find my purpose, not because I didn\u2019t know what to do, but because something was missing: I knew that before I could bring peace to the world, I had to find peace within. Black women are often the first on the frontlines, the first to offer their time and hearts to every person and cause; I was riddled with guilt when I decided that I would allow myself time for healing, but I knew that my ability to show up for my community was dependent on my ability to show up for myself. I had to find ways to give myself space\u2014to grieve, but also to nourish both my mind and body. If that meant silent meditative walks in the backyard, baking a couple loaves of banana bread, and journaling profusely over a cup of Moroccan mint tea, then so be it.Black joy itself is a revolutionary act, essential\u2014not counter\u2014to my activism and to the liberation of my community. It may feel unattainable, or like a distant memory, but as Dr. Angela Davis has taught us, joy is what allows us \u201cto bring our entire selves into the movement.\u201d It must be prioritized.These are some of the people and things that bring me joy, and remind me to live my life fully for all those who no longer can:Walking in the Footsteps of GirlTrek\u2019s Black History BootcampFor 21 days, GirlTrek\u2019s walking meditation led 650,000 women in the footsteps of 21 powerful Black women. Each day, participants received an email centering a Black woman who has shaped our history in some way, from Shirley Chisholm to Marsha P. Johnson, with speeches, videos, playlists and questions to consider during a meditative walk. This bootcamp reinforced my belief in the importance of radical self care and empowered me to keep on keepin\u2019 on. The fire that drove these women to continuously fight for justice now burns in each of us\u2014and while the 21 days are over, all the resources can still be accessed on their site.Tabitha Brown\u2019s Contagious EnergyTabitha Brown is a Black woman, mother, wife, vegan blogger, and the light we didn\u2019t know we were missing! She has used her platform to not only talk about Black wellness as it pertains to food but also to spark conversation about social justice, family, marriage, beauty, and all that brings her joy these days. From her \u201cVery Good Mondays\u201d where she reviews various products from Black-owned businesses with her daughter, to her quick cooking videos, she brings excitement to all things wellness related. Her positive energy is infectious.Finding Liberation in PoetryWhile I\u2019m usually not one for audiobooks, listening to Nikki Giovanni and Sonia Sanchez recite their poetry on their respective albums immediately soothes my soul. Both poets have used their artistry to speak on Black love, challenges, triumphs and above all, how to move forward. Their poetry has been a true symbol of love for me\u2014love of self and love of another in all our glory. Hearing their tender, yet powerful, voices over gospel music and blues is the very thing we could all use right now.Playing \u2018We Are Not Really Strangers\u2019The purpose of this game is to empower meaningful connections, deepening your existing relationships and creating new ones. Players work their way through three levels of questions that focus on perception, connection, and reflection. Questions such as \u201cWhat would your younger self not believe about your life today?\u201d encourage you to reflect on your life and all that you have become. The game challenges us to be vulnerable for the sake of genuine connection\u2014and a free additional PDF goes a step further with a few questions to guide conversations around race and privilege. I\u2019ve played with my family and friends on separate occasions and we laughed, cried, and felt more compassion and understanding for one another. The vulnerability is worth it!The Healing Power of Nina SimoneWhen I can\u2019t find the words to explain my grief, my anger, my triumphs and my love, I know I can turn to music. These days, Nina Simone is the only one who is getting it right. Her music is the essence of Black life\u2014the struggle, beauty, and strength that we possess. My day begins with her voice because her energy is unmatched. She awakens every part of my body, as nobody can possibly listen to Feeling Good without at least swaying their hips. Her music serves as a constant reminder to rise again and cherish the day.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSelf CareessayRead MoreLifestyleThere Is No Wellness Without Anti-RacismBy Courtney Robinson and Uzma ChowdhuryRecipes you want to make.
