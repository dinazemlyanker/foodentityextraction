Our snack table\u2014what, your office doesn\u2019t have a designated area?\u2014offers up everything from souvenir seedy rye loaves to Test Kitchen treats, but nothing causes a stir quite like BjornQorn.Made by a Minnesota corn farmer\u2019s son named Bjorn and his liberal arts school roommate (truly, you can\u2019t make this up), BjornQorn is popcorn that\u2019s been popped with solar power and liberally (see what I did there?) dusted with nutty-salty nutritional yeast like some sort of healthyish\u2014but no less potent\u2014Dorito dust. Carla Lalli Music\u2014who\u2019s basically the patron saint of making your own stovetop popcorn\u2014says BjornQorn is the only packaged popcorn worth buying. It even scored a mention in our 2018 food yearbook, a rhapsodic compilation of the best things we ate that year. (And yes, true to form, the PDX/Silver Lake set has long loved it too.)Even after a solid year of showing up in the office, BjornQorn still reigns supreme in our hearts and stomachs, probably because it\u2019s impossible to stop eating after a single handful. I\u2019ve attempted to mimic the stuff at home, armed with a packet of microwavable popcorn and a jar of Bragg\u2019s nutritional yeast, but it just doesn\u2019t compare.The cult status of BjornQorn makes it perfect for picnics, parties, and surreptitious movie theater snacks, which is why I hoard bags at my desk. Still, it\u2019s rare they ever leave the premises. It doesn\u2019t even have to be on the snack table\u2014if someone spots that cheerful yellow logo peaking out of my tote bag, it\u2019s as good as gone.Buy it: BjornQorn, $43 for a dozen 3 oz. bagsAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
