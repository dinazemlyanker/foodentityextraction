But if your dad is less of a sports guy and more of a food guy, we\u2019re here to help. We\u2019ve rounded up nine gift ideas that go beyond the bottle of scotch or the Big Green Egg, so whether the father figure in your life loves to cook (check out the box of sushi-grade sustainable fish) or just wants to look like someone who does (perhaps a masc leather apron?), we\u2019ve got you covered. Read on for the best Father\u2019s Day gifts for 2021.For the dad who can\u2019t resist a rib eye (or cauliflower steak)For years the best gift anyone could give my grandfather was a steak knife pilfered from Outback Steakhouse. By the time he died, he had place settings for twelve. If your dad also prizes a hefty steak knife but you shy away from petty theft, grab him a set from Misen. The Kickstarter-funded, direct-to-consumer kitchenware brand makes one of our favorite bread knives, and their serrated steak knives are equally as sleek, sharp, and reasonably priced. The handles come in a variety of colors, from dusky blue to sage green.Misen Steak Knives$80 at MisenFor the dad who won\u2019t let anyone else start the fireParenthood is all about adaptability (we see you, dads making it work in men\u2019s bathrooms without changing tables), as is the BioLite FirePit+, which converts from wood to charcoal and from fire pit to grill. Toast marshmallows over its open flames or pop on the grate, load it up with sambal chicken skewers, and you\u2019ve got yourself a backyard hibachi. While other fire pits will keep you warmer (that\u2019s the Solo Stove), we love the FirePit+ for its portability. At under twenty pounds and featuring handles and foldable legs, it\u2019s perfect for car camping, tailgating, or parking lot apr\u00e8s-ski.Photo courtesy BioLiteBioLite FirePit+$250 at BioLite EnergyFor the dad who has a coffee subscription and a bean subscription and a meat subscription\u2026Get him started on natural wine too. With MYSA\u2019s natural wine club, you can gift Dad either three, six, or a dozen bottles of low-intervention wine either monthly, bi-monthly, or quarterly. Previous months have included selections from producers like Swick, Meinklang, and The Marigny, and if you use code CLUB15, you can score 15% off your first order. Dads love natty wine and value.\u00a0Photo by @hellopiacereMYSA Natural Wine Club Subscription$150 $105 at MYSA WinesFor the dad who\u2019d rather be fishing (but never catches anything)Give your dad the gift of not having to hover in the fish aisle, trying to figure out if the sustainably farm-raised salmon is a more responsible choice than the ethically caught wild cod. PureFish\u2019s Rainbow Box contains 16 servings of sushi-grade salmon, tuna, scallops, shrimp, and more, all shock frozen to retain peak freshness and texture. Each portion is fully traceable; just scan the QR code to learn more about the fisherman or farmer behind fish.PureFish Rainbow Box$250 at PureFishFor the dad who loves his \u2018shroomsThis Disco Fungi cabana shirt from Brooklyn-based clothing brand Tombolo screams \u201cI may be a dad, but I still fuck with psychadelics.\u201d Made of 100% organic cotton terry cloth, this long-sleeved number is the perfect weight for summer evenings around the campfire or when the breeze picks up at the beach.Photo courtesy TomboloTombolo Fungi Top$136 at TomboloFor the leather dad(dy)For dads who do heavy-duty grilling or who just wanna butch it up in the kitchen, consider a leather apron from French Canadian brand Simons. In slate grey suede or fawn-colored leather, these aprons are outfitted with plenty of pockets to stash your phone and a Thermapen. Complete the leather-on-leather look with a fetching oven mitt.Photo courtesy La Maison SimonsMaison Leather Apron$100 $90 at SimonsFor the dad who needs a spa dayIf your dad can\u2019t get to Japan for a full-blown onsen experience, these Jinen Japanese hot spring bath salts are the next best thing. Fragranced with hinoki wood essential oils, this blend of baking soda and minerals from Mt. Yakedake, an active volcano in the Northern Japanese Alps, will leave his dad bod feeling silky smooth and refreshed.Photo courtesy JinenJapanese Hot Spring Bath Salts$35 at JinenFor the dad with the corniest jokesEven if the dad figure in your life has a full set of barware and his own \u201cice program,\u201d there\u2019s little chance that he has a bottle of corn liqueur on his bar cart. Nixta licor de elote is made from nixtamalized heirloom cacahuazintle corn grown northwest of Mexico City. It tastes like August\u2019s sweetest corn with a finish that can only be described as tortillas right off the comal. Combine a splash with whiskey and a few dashes of bitters for a summery take on an old fashioned.Photo courtesy Nixta Licor de EloteNixta Licor de Elote$32 at DrizlyFor the dad who composts and bikes everywhere and would like to tell you all about this podcast he listened to on solar panelsFor a Father\u2019s Day gift that eco-Dad will love, consider this set of two drinking glasses by Siafu Home made from recycled glass bottles and hand-etched with a botanical motif by artisans in Kenya. The brand places an emphasis on sourcing all its materials sustainably, upcycling whenever possible, while preserving traditional East African handicrafts like basket weaving, beading, and horn carving.Maji Etched Drinking Glasses$100 at GoodeeExplore Bon App\u00e9titGift GuidesShoppingFather's DayRecipes you want to make.
