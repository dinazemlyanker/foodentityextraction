See our past recommendations here!Of all the items that my local grocery store sold out of last week\u2014flour, eggs, good olive oil\u2014the thing that I was least worried about was toilet paper. I strode by the decimated paper goods aisle without even a flicker of worry because I have another way to clean my butt.With the money you spent buying four months\u2019 worth of toilet paper, you could have purchased a TUSHY. This bidet attachment snaps onto your toilet and features an adjustable nozzle that spritzes your butt with water after you do your business, drastically reducing the amount of toilet paper needed. It also leaves me feeling cleaner. Think about it: If you had something dirty on your hands, wouldn't you rather wash them in the sink than wipe them off with 2-ply paper?I\u2019ve had my TUSHY Classic for about a year, and I warn you that pooping without it is now a misery. Unlike Toto toilets, the bidets most popular in Japan that can cost several thousand dollars, the TUSHY Classic is only $79\u2014and you can get a 10 percent discount if you use the code TIME4TUSHY (LOL).Granted, it doesn\u2019t have all the bells and whistles of a Japanese toilet, and while the TUSHY Spa offers a warm water option, the water from the Classic model comes out cold. (The sensation is...bracing.) But it does the trick, leaving me feeling fresher than toilet paper alone and certainly less chafed.And while Americans have historically been anti-bidet, according to Wired, TUSHY sales have increased tenfold in the last few weeks. I may be worried about a lot of things right now, but my butt isn't one of them.Buy it: Tushy Bidet Attachment, from $79All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
