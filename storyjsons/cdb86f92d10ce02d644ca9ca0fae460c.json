We think not! Pickled peppers are the secret star of this dish, lending acidity and just the right amount of heat to an otherwise rich one-skillet meal. (Don\u2019t throw out the pickled pepper liquid\u2014it makes a great addition to a vinaigrette or Bloody Mary.) The steak should be pretty rare when you shingle it over the vegetables, but don\u2019t worry: After a few minutes under the broiler, it will be perfectly cooked.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I marinated top sirloin to tenderize it, then followed the recipe closely. Once the chopping is done, this dish comes together quickly.
