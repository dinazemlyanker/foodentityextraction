He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.When you\u2019ve got a mother-in-law who\u2019s allergic to shellfish, an 11-year-old who won\u2019t look at the stuff, a wife who is obsessed with linguine vongole, and a father in law who asks why you didn\u2019t buy more clams, that\u2019s when you make two pastas for dinner.To be clear, I\u2019m not suggesting anyone else actually do this. But it was an interesting exercise, at least, in shared stove-top negotiations and marital relations.Simone\u2019s parents were visiting for the weekend, along with Cousin Tony (who was firmly on Team Vongole), and Simone announced she was making her favorite pasta for dinner. She alerted me that I was on the hook for something that both Marlon and her mom would like.Without missing a beat, I settled on Molly Baz\u2019s pasta al limone, a luscious, super simple recipe, fit for grandmas and grandsons alike.On a tight four-burner stove, we filled up a big stock pot with liberally salted water. Into that would go enough dried pasta for both dishes\u2014a little over a pound for five people.Want this letter before it hits the website?

Eventually, in went two dozen little necks, a generous splash of ros\u00e9 and, because it\u2019s August, a big handful of sun gold tomatoes.Elbow to elbow, I started on the limone sauce in an oval Dutch oven. Heavy cream, butter, lemon zest. Simmer.Just as the spaghetti chitarra was approaching al dente, we added a cup of starchy pasta water to each cooking vessel to help emulsify the sauces. We then tonged the pasta straight into pots and I showered the creamy limone with a handful of finely grated parm.Despite my initial skepticism, we got both pastas to the table simultaneously, all hot and saucy and glossy. I won\u2019t say which was better (no point in starting an argument with my wife now, given we emerged from our cook-off unscathed). I\u2019ll just say that maybe making two pastas for dinner isn\u2019t such a crazy idea, after all.Get the recipes:BA's Best Linguine and ClamsClams vary in brininess and the amount of liquid they\u2019ll release during cooking, so you\u2019ll need to adjust the salt and add pasta water accordingly. To prevent the sauce from getting too salty, we recommend a measured amount of salt for the pasta water. If possible, look for an artisanal dried pasta for this recipe\u2014the rougher surface texture will catch the slippery sauce better.View Recipe\u00a0Pasta al LimoneThis creamy lemon pasta recipe is luscious and amply cheesy, but still bright and fresh.
