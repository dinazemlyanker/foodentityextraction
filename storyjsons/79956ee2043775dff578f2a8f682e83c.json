Better yet, make this recipe for yourself. Just try and use double-concentrated tomato paste, which packs more flavor than the standard stuff.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Parmesan cheese2Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling14.5-oz. tube double-concentrated tomato paste\u00bdtsp. crushed red pepper flakes2oz. vodka\u00becup heavy cream1lb. rigatoniBasil leaves (for serving)PreparationStep 1Fill a stock pot or other large pot three-quarters full with water and heat over high. Toss in a handful of salt and bring to a boil while you do your other prep.Step 2Peel and finely chop 1 onion.Step 3Firmly smash 4 garlic cloves with the flat side of a chef\u2019s knife and remove peel.Step 4Grate 4 oz. Parmesan on the smallest holes of the box grater.Step 5Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a Dutch oven over medium (position it next to pot of water). Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring constantly, just until onion is starting to brown around the edges, 5\u20137 minutes.Step 6Add entire 4.5-oz. tube tomato paste and \u00bd tsp. red pepper flakes and stir until paste evenly coats onion. Continue to cook, stirring often, until paste is deep red and starting to brown on bottom of pot, 5\u20137 minutes.Step 7Add 2 oz. vodka to deglaze pan and stir to incorporate, scraping bottom of pot. Reduce heat to low.Step 8Using a heatproof glass measuring cup, scoop about \u00bc cup boiling water from pot, then add \u00be cup heavy cream to measuring cup (this brings up the temperature of the cream so it won\u2019t break when you add it to the pot).Step 9Slowly add warmed cream to Dutch oven, stirring constantly, until a smooth sauce forms. Remove from heat.Step 10Add 1 lb. rigatoni to pot of boiling salted water and cook according to package instructions until al dente. About 1 minute before the timer goes off, use heatproof measuring cup to scoop up about 1 cup pasta cooking liquid. Heat Dutch oven over low.Step 11Using a spider, transfer rigatoni to Dutch oven along with any water that\u2019s piggybacking on the pasta.Step 12Add \u00bd cup pasta cooking liquid to Dutch oven and stir to incorporate, then gradually add half of Parmesan, stirring constantly to melt cheese. You should have a smooth, glossy sauce that coats each piece of pasta. Season with salt and add a splash more pasta cooking liquid to thin sauce, if needed.Step 13Divide pasta among bowls. Top with remaining cheese, dividing evenly. Drizzle with more oil, then tear basil leaves over.How would you rate Rigatoni with Easy Vodka Sauce?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (130)Back to TopTriangleRestaurant quality recipe. SOOO Good!\nI omit the red pepper flakes, as I don't like it spicy.Katie BWinona, MN3/8/2022This is the best and easiest vodka sauce recipe ever!! My family begs for it and I now make it twice a week:)KarenMarlboro, NJ3/6/2022The recipe was super easy and it was very flavorful.  I added pancetta to the recipe!  AnonymousNJ2/23/2022I used  Banza chickpea pasta and this was Awesome!!!NellieSurrey ND2/23/2022Love this easy recipe - sometimes to add more protein to it, I had ground up sausage meat to the sauce, or even sliced sausage, as it goes well with the heat of the red chilli flakes\u2026 \n\nI also find that you can cook the noodles while you make the sauce, that way it\u2019s not just sitting on the stove for 15 minutes\u2026NSToronto2/22/2022I have a question: can this be frozen for a week or so and then reheated either on the stove top or in the oven? I'm taking some casseroles to a friend whose husband is having surgery. I want to help her stock her freezer with quick & easy AND delicious meals. Thanks!\nKarenLometa, Texas2/17/2022This recipe is one for the books. I did it a few weeks ago, and just knowing I'll do it tonight, I woke up in a good mood. Isa O'DoghertyMexico City1/28/2022Holy shmoly! This recipe rocks!! I had to sub the vodka with mirin (Asian household here) and sub the tomato paste with canned diced tomato and tomato sauce mix which worked as well. Added cayenne for spice and went ape on pepper flakes. It was a little saucier (but not by much) than the BA versions. Love love love.JPalisades Park, NJ1/25/2022Wow so easy to make and the taste is so good!! I cannot wait to make again and again. This recipe is definitely a keeper!!MariaCBlue Bell, PA1/24/2022instrucftions not consistent. ingredients call for 14.5 oz tube of tomato paste. Steps say add entire 4.5 oz tube of tomato sauce.\nw.kennedyvancouver1/14/2022Sure it is tasty, but can we have a nutritional breakout? How many gazillions of calories in one serving? How much fat?AnonymousFresno,Ca1/14/2022Wayyhayyyy too much red pepperMonaBuffalo1/10/2022So good!! I added more cheese, 2 Oz more vodka and more tomato paste. I also sprinkled a bit of garlic salt and cracked pepper over it upon serving. Fantastic dish. Mrs LunaSF Bay Area, Ca1/3/2022First time making vodka sauce, definitely not my last.
