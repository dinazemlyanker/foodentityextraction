Puglisi\u2019s seven-year-old casual wine bar offshoot of Rel\u00e6 still feels pretty radical. Chefs from around the world have filled their tables with his family-style plates of charred veggies, that famous beef tartare, and bottles of natural wine, then went forth to spread the gospel. (At least that\u2019s our take.) Puglisi makes this destination feel like a neighborhood spot as locals often stop for takeout (pro hotel tip!).ORDER THE: beef tartare; short ribs with rhubarb chutney; and potatoes with fermented mushroom cream. But if you can\u2019t decide: Get the family-style tasting for the table.THE VIBE IS: casual, fun, easy\u2014though if you didn\u2019t reserve, getting a seat requires patience. Bonus: International food hipster is spoken here.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day for lunch, from noon to 3:30 p.m., and dinner, from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m.\u2014Christine MuhlkePhoto by Ditte IsagerPhoto by Ditte IsagerWE ALSO LOVEMirabellePlan a mini croissant- and yogurt-filled vacation at this caf\u00e9-like spot in N\u00f8rreboroRel\u00e6Live a little with the N\u00f8rrebro tasting-menu restaurant that\u2019s still making waves B\u00e6stPizza perfected in Inner N\u00f8rrebroExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
