I like things\u2014tchotchkes, knick-knacks, call \u2018em what you will. They really do bring me joy! However, that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want to appear neat and tidy. My solution: these perfectly simple, utilitarian-but-still-cute trays from Schoolhouse Electric.In my bedroom, I have one that holds my serums, sunscreen, and moisturizer. In my kitchen, another keeps the hand soap and sponge in place on the side of the sink. On my bar cart, you\u2019ll find little bottles of bitters and wine openers that might otherwise get lost behind bigger bottles of alcohol, nicely grouped together on, yep, one of these trays. That\u2019s the magic of these Schoolhouse Electric pieces. Suddenly, all of my things stand with purpose instead of appearing haphazard.I have a collection of trays (like I said, I like my things!), but what I particularly love about the Schoolhouse ones is their neutral tones and small but sweet size. I use all three colors (army green, off-white, and dark turquoise) and swap them around my apartment without fear that they won\u2019t look good or fit in a given space. Oh, and did I mention they\u2019re super easy to clean? They\u2019re made from fiberglass, so after some neglect, one quick wipe down has them sparkling like new again.I may never be able to downsize my things to Marie\u2019s liking\u2014but with these trays, I don\u2019t even want to.Buy it: Mini Compartment Tray, $10 at Schoolhouse ElectricAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
