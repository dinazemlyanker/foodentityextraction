Tommaso serves a side of crooning Italian ballads.By Giulia MelucciApril 16, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Travis RaineyFacebookTwitterEmailWelcome to Red Sauce America, our coast-to-coast celebration of old-school Italian-American restaurants.I\u2019ve been eating at Tommaso all my life. Since 1974 this restaurant in Dyker Heights, a section of Brooklyn where hipsters seldom venture, has been serving up dishes that are classic yet transcend Italian-American clich\u00e9s. Resident chef/owner/tenor Tommaso Verdillo was honoring white truffle season before many of his peers across the river had even heard of it. You can order veal cutlet Parmigiana, but you\u2019ll never see beside it a bowl of anemic penne topped with a circle of tomato sauce. Instead of oil paintings of Chianti bottles, the decor features reproductions of Renaissance frescoes, like that snippet of Michelangelo\u2019s Sistine Chapel where God extends his hand to create Adam. The food\u2019s always good, sometimes it\u2019s great, and if the meal doesn\u2019t soar, it doesn\u2019t matter because you\u2019re listening or singing along to opera arias, classic Neapolitan songs, and the occasional pop ballad, provided by Verdillo and a rotating cast of singers with piano accompaniment every weekend.\u201cMy father thought he was going to have the next Caruso and get rich,\u201d Verdillo told me recently. His vocal talent was discovered when he was a child singing in church; in his teens he studied to be an opera singer in Manhattan, but by his 20s he was no longer aiming for La Scala. \u201cI was too shy,\u201d Verdillo said. He can\u2019t recall the first time he sang in the restaurant; \u201cit just evolved,\u201d he said, from the kitchen to the dining room. At 73, his voice remains strong.Prepare for the most delicious musical performance in Brooklyn.\nPhoto by Travis RaineyThat kind of thing can be too much for kids. When our parents took us to Tommaso in the \u201980s, my brothers and I would try really hard to look at our chicken scarpariello and not each other when Verdillo, dressed in a harlequin costume (it was Carnavale), performed \u201cRidi Pagliaccio,\u201d a showstopper. We knew if any of us caught the other\u2019s eye we would lose it. Right around the time my childhood ended, my father died, but my mother and I kept returning to Tommaso. By then I had developed an appreciation for opera and especially for wine (Tommaso has a world-class list), but I braced myself one Saturday evening when Tommaso pulled a chair next to our table, closed his eyes, and began to sing \u201cWind Beneath My Wings,\u201d the theme song from the tear-jerker movie Beaches. I thought I would laugh; instead, I was moved, almost to tears. Tommaso elevated that song above the sentimental. He showed his heart, as he\u2019s been doing with his restaurant for nearly half a century.Giulia Melucci is the author of I Loved, I Lost, I Made Spaghetti.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsItalian AmericanRed SauceBrooklynRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
