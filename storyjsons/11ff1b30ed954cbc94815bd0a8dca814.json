If it is, welcome to the world. We have a lot to talk about. But, here\u2019s the thing, regardless of how healthy the ingredients that comprise them are or aren\u2019t, there is no denying that we\u2019ve taken this particular chocolate-tahini bliss ball recipe to a very special place.  A place just a few steps further than the rest. Let me explain.In developing this recipe, it was important to me that the bliss balls were soft, fudgy and reminiscent of a chocolate truffle while still relatively healthy.  They are only two-biters after all, so you really wanna pack it in both flavor and texture-wise for those two bites.  Far too many of the versions i\u2019ve tasted in the past were dense, chewy and tacky, like eating fruit leather more than a truffle. To achieve a smoother and fudgier result, I leaned on tahini to provide both nutty flavor and a creamy, rich texture. The next task was to strike the perfect balance of sweetness with the savory tahini base. A first round, in which I used dates as the sole sweetener, ended up too dense and chewy. So I split the difference, cut back on some of the dates, and added maple syrup to lend a lighter texture. At this point, we were close. To round out the flavor, and because I think you\u2019ll agree that most things are enhanced by chocolate, I added unsweetened cocoa powder.  Finally, I rolled each one in a crunchy mix of toasted sesame seeds and chopped toasted pistachios.What resulted were bliss balls that, in the best way possible, tastes almost exactly like brownie batter without the stomach ache from all the raw eggs, sugar, and oil.  These little guys (and gals, and folks) are sweet, savory, and most importantly extremely versatile\u2014they\u2019re just as perfect for breakfast as they are right before you hit the gym or at the end of a meal when you just CAN\u2019T go to bed without satisfying that sweet tooth.  They will keep for up to a week in your fridge and almost indefinitely in your freezer so you\u2019ll never be left hanging. Try them out for yourself\u2014I think you\u2019ll be blissed out.Follow your bliss:Salted Chocolate\u2013Tahini Bliss BallsThese two-biters are just fudgy and chocolaty enough to satisfy a sweet tooth craving.
