(Not even Martha Stewart could skip it.) Those willing to wait, however, are rewarded with complimentary passed hors d\u2019oeuvres and cups of hot chai while in line and one of the most iconic dining experiences once inside.ORDER THE: ever-popular lamb popsicles; jackfruit in black cardamom and cumin curry; a heaping platter of perfectly charred naan; and whatever else your server recommends based on your tastes. To start, go with a cocktail (bartender Jay Jones's Dark Army No.2 with LemonHart demerara rum, mango, and garam masala is an agreeable choice), then move on to wine\u2014the staff is always ready with a suggestion for pairings with your meal.THE VIBE IS: convivial, with many groups sharing family-style meals. The newer open-concept dining room lacks the intimacy of their former space, so ask for a table near a window or, even better, on their rooftop patio during the summer.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day, from 5:30 p.m. and onward until they decide to close. No reservations.\u2014Lindsay AndersonGrant HarderWE ALSO LOVEKishimotoThe Drive\u2019s no-frills standby for impeccable sushiDon\u2019t Argue!
