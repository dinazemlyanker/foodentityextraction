It\u2019s the oldest wheat variety out there. It\u2019s also high in protein, iron, thiamine, dietary fiber, B vitamins, and the antioxidant lutein. \u201cIt tastes bran-y,\u201d says Roxana Jullapat, the author of the cookbook Mother Grains (out April 2021). \u201cIt can get a little milk-chocolaty too. Shortbread is a good canvas for it because it brings out that richness. And einkorn loves butter.\u201d Make sure to use einkorn flour labeled \u201cwhole grain,\u201d which has been ground with the whole kernel (that\u2019s where all the nutritious goodness and flavor is). All-purpose einkorn flour isn\u2019t the same. Jullapat\u2019s favorite einkorn is from Grist & Toll, a whole-grain mill in Pasadena, CA.IngredientsMakes about 12\u00bccup (packed; 50 g) dark brown sugar\u00bccup (28 g) powdered sugar\u00bdcup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into \u00bd\" pieces, room temperature\u00becup (85 g) whole grain einkorn flour\u00bdcup plus 1 Tbsp.

Remove top sheet of parchment and punch out cookies with larger cutter. If using smaller cutter, punch out center of each cookie. Carefully transfer cookies to a large parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing 1\" apart. Reroll scraps; punch out more cookies.Step 3Bake cookies, rotating baking sheet front to back halfway through if browning unevenly, until golden and firm around edges, 25\u201335 minutes.

I appreciated using one tool to bring everything together. I will reduce the sugar a bit next time. This was my first time baking with Einkorn flour. Intrigued.   LizGVancouver, BC3/28/2021I love these cookies. I love einkorn flour and this is truly the perfect application for it... buttery and toasty, they are perfect with a cup of tea or coffee. I really liked how thick the cookies were.. it gave them a nice heft that stood up to a bit of dunking in hot liquid. I reduced the sugars by about 1/4 and it was perfectKamLos Angeles2/11/2021Tried these for the first time and they are the most delicious shortbread I have ever tasted, more complex than others.  I found the dough a bit sticky and hard to cut out, but chilling slightly helped. I think I made them thinner than the recipe called for, but I like the crispy way that turned out. They have held up well in a well sealed container. Very buttery, so I have to limit my enjoyment, lest my arteries plug up immediately. Might try cutting the brown sugar back just a tad, as I like cookies slightly less sweet. My first Einkorn experience and I am a convert!AnonymousFt. Myers, FL2/9/2021These cookies are very delicious! They are buttery, nutty, and complex in flavor. I love that they come together in the food processor. I\u2019d love some guidance around whether refrigerating the dough or incorporating cold butter vs room temp butter would change the end result. The color indicator for doneness was not helpful as the dough is quite dark to begin with.
