This version comes from Shani Jones of Peaches Patties in San Francisco, named in honor of her mother\u2019s signature recipe. Adding turmeric to the dough gives it its distinctive yellow color. Let the patties sit for a while after baking for maximum flavor, and serve them with hot sauce (Jones suggests the classic: Pickapeppa) alongside.

Also this is the first time I\u2019ve made pastry encrusted meat pie always found the idea quite intimidating. I cooked the filling one day and made the pastry the next to take some of the anxiety out of it.   I looked at the comments and followed some of the suggestions and also from the patties I\u2019ve previously enjoyed. I agree with the commentor that the pre-fried ground beef would be a bit crumbly and not traditional even with the gravy the texture would be wrong it\u2019s more like paste style ground beef that\u2019s boiled. So I cooked the onions to soft, added the spices to toast then added stock (1 cup as suggested in comments )then the Beef, and cooked it down to a thick gravy. Also I used 1 tablespoon of Scotch bonnet pepper sauce (the brand Grace from Jamaica)  as I couldn\u2019t find fresh scotch bonnets I got 10 large patties out of this recipe and  they were awesome! They will be part of our regular rotation, just fantastic! This is a great recipe to try meat type pies! AnonymousVANCOUVER Canada 3/23/2021Absolutely thought these were delicious! Will make again!Anonymous9/4/2020So I've been eyeing this recipe for awhile, and finally made it last night! It was a lot easier than I expected. I don't  have a food processor so I made the dough by hand. When rolling it out, I folded it over several times so it would be light and not too heavy. Turned out good...just wish the dough had more flavor.. I saw another reviewer say they used vodka. I will try that next time instead of vinegar. \nAs for the filling...it was okay as well.. granted, I couldn't find a habanero (#quarantine) so I used a jalape\u00f1o and added some chili powder and crushed red pepper (loveeee spice). And still it was just okay. I think I will play around with the filling a bit more. Maybe try adding a bit of curry next time to see if the flavor is more authentic. \nAll in all, easy to follow and turned out good. I will make this again for company (when we can do that again). AnonymousChicago8/4/2020I\u2019ve made these twice now during Quarantine Times\u2122 ;) I follow the dough recipe as written. The first time I had to cut in the butter with knives (because I forgot our blender had a food processor attachment!) and I think that time the dough was better because the butter chunks were bigger. Then I sort of freestyle the inside, using the recipe as framework since you don\u2019t always have every ingredient on hand anymore. Last night had the addition of some leftover potatoes which ended up disappearing into the beef but making the juices into a thick sauce. It\u2019s a great way to stretch a pound of ground beef into a meal. missmatlockLos Angeles5/20/2020Made these tonight, big hit.  Made them with ground chicken because that was what we had in the fridge.  Adjusted the spices to be able to share with friends  that prefer things a little less spicy.  The pastry is super easy, super flaky.  Will definitely make again.  AnonymousMontreal4/22/2020Love the shell of this patty. I added one habanero without seeding it and it turned out a little too spicy for me. When rolling out the dough, I found portioning the dough into 18 balls before rolling it out to be easier and more consistent than the method stated in the recipe. camelEau Claire, WI4/13/2020Excellent recipe, filling flavorful, slight spice, and delicious.  Actually better than the more generic beef patties found in stores or sold at Carribean themed events/food trucks.  Will definitely be making this one again.AnonymousMinneapolis, MN1/25/2020The dough has excellent flavor.  I used vodka instead of vinegar.  Despite all the seasoning I was surprised at how bland the filling was.  I would recommend only 1 not 2 cups of broth as the filling can\u2019t be juicy or it will run all over.  Make the filling in advance and let it cool To at least room temp so it won\u2019t cause the crust to melt and fall apart around it.  AnonymousMinneapolis1/14/2020Not bad but not too authentic.  How about a recipie for Stamp & Go? The real version.quilty_luca1/13/2020I can't leave a bad review as the recipe is in itself tasty, but i do want to say that this is an empanada style rendition of a patty. Jamaican beef patty's use lard or suet in the crust and is folded in to create a much more flaky texture. Furthermore the meat is typically of a more blended consistency and will not fall out in large chunks as seen in the image above. Finally the crust of the patty will stick to the meat inside, and the flakes will be considerably more moist, a result of the heavier suet/lard used in the cooking process. Again this recipe is tasty as is, but i feel it is important to make the distinction that a jamaican beef patty bought from a bakery on the streets of jamaica will not come out the same as this due to the nuances listed above. Finally i give my respect to the creator of this recipe and bless up.McfarquharpJamaican American1/9/2020The dough/pastry was great.  Really nice and flaky with good flavour.  I would have liked the filling a little spicier, so would probably add another habanero next time, but that's completely dependent on the peppers you can get.  I'm not sure how you can simmer off a full cup of liquid in 5-8 minutes. I ended up at probably twice that, but may have erred on the dry side to avoid a soggy filling.\nOverall, a great dinner that I'll make again.AnonymousNewfoundland, Canada1/9/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titJamaicanCaribbeanGround BeefBeefMeatTurmericHerbs & SpicesScotch BonnetChileVegetableSnackStarterNut-FreeLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
