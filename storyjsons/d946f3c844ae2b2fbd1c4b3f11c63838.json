A few decades later in Atlanta, my grandmother made a version of it as an after-school snack for me, too, but here, she sometimes used instant noodles and I sometimes added a few healthy shakes of Parmesan. Now, a couple decades after that, I\u2019ve added some vegetables\u2014and rarely skip the parm\u2014for a dish that comes together so fast that I can make it and eat it in a 30-minute break between meetings. \u2014Sonia ChopraAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

You soak the chana dal and then eat it without cooking it?  I always thought dal had to be cooked for much longer or in a pressure cooker? Anonymous2/23/2022I made tadka orzo - tadka was cumin seeds. Vegetables were peas carrots and beans.  My own recipe.RevaNew Bern, NC6/16/2021I\u2019d like to make this next week, but I don\u2019t see the curry leaves in the final dish, if there\u2019s 30 of them you think you would, do they need to be on stalks?Kara North Carolina 6/4/2021Actually, genuinely, INSANELY good. Reminds me of sevai upkari (made with vermicelli and similar spices). The butter is a decadent addition and it literally took 8 minutes end to end because I had some cooked pasta in the fridge. Kudos!!
