Don't Argue! is so cool you\u2019re unlikely to get served with a smile, but it\u2019s worth it for the pie, available either whole or by the slice.ORDER THE: pesto ricotta pizza, which has the perfect crust for sopping up leftover olive oil on the pan. The sausage-kale is a stellar red-sauce option, while the pancetta-pineapple is a must for OG Hawaiian pizza fans.THE VIBE IS: relaxed, with flour-dusted hipsters behind the counter and plenty of chill neighborhood regulars at the tables. If you can, grab a coveted spot on the tiny front patio and watch the eclectic Main Street crowds pass by.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day: Monday to Friday, from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m.; Saturday, from 1 p.m. to 11 p.m.; and Sunday, from 1 p.m. to 10 p.m.\u2014Lindsay AndersonGrant HarderGrant HarderExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
