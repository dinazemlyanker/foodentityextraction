I put them to the test.By Deanna PaiFebruary 27, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsea KyleFacebookTwitterEmailBeing a light sleeper has made me old. My driver\u2019s license says I\u2019m 29, but there I am, leaving angry notes for the owners of the barking dog across the hall, calling the city\u2019s noise-complaint hotline at the sound of early-morning construction, and occasionally banging a broomstick on my ceiling. My boyfriend, who snores at the sight of dairy (or so he tells me over pizza), has only complicated matters.Not only am I acting like a grandma, but my skin is, too. Research links poor sleep quality to increased signs of skin aging and compromised barrier function (which leads to moisture loss in the skin). Sleep is when skin gets a break from the barrage of pollution and sun exposure, so cells take this opportunity to repair and restore themselves. Without rest, it\u2019s bound to suffer some consequences. The upside: From overnight supplements to creams and oils, new beauty and wellness products are now factoring sleep into their skin-enhancing equation. I decided to put them to the test to see whether or not they could keep me asleep\u2014and help my skin along the way.Evolution 18 Overnight VanillaThe Tahitian vanilla seemed almost sickly-sweet when I first mixed this white powder with water. (I changed my tune once I tried a non-flavored supplement.) But it has collagen peptides, biotin, hyaluronic acid, and coconut oil to boost skin\u2019s hydration and elasticity, as well as calming magnesium to promote sleep, so it was a worthy tradeoff. I slept straight through until around 5:30 AM, a.k.a. the time of day I tend to bolt awake, worried that I\u2019d slept through my alarm. When I eventually rolled out of bed, my skin\u2019s texture looked a little smoother and felt softer\u2014and my usual undereye bags had deflated.Buy it: Evolution 18 Overnight Vanilla, $48.Votary Antidote Night OilI love the idea of scenting myself to sleep. There\u2019s something that seems luxurious about body oil too, since it implies you have either the means to hire someone to remove oil residue from your white couch or the ability to live with the stain in peace. I have neither, which is why I was stoked to find that this night oil, infused with lavender and chamomile, sinks in within seconds. I applied it to my entire upper-body, including my neck, right before putting on my pajamas, and didn\u2019t notice any transferring or greasy texture. An hour later, I could smell the herbal blend as I settled in under the covers. Reader, I slept like a baby\u2014and woke to the soft skin of one, too.Buy it: Votary Antidote Night Oil, $118.Moon Juice Night BeautyI\u2019ve never actually used a Moon Juice supplement before, so I had high hopes for this one\u2014which were dashed when I opened up the canister and took a whiff of it. This stuff smells rank, like I dug it out from under a rock in the woods behind my parents\u2019 house. And it does not taste any better, though it helped to mix it with hot water and call it tea. It\u2019s more sleep-focused than the Evolution 18 supplement, supposedly helping you drift off with a blend of stress-reducing ashwagandha and jujube seed. For skin, there\u2019s amla berry (to support collagen) and schisandra berry (to minimize inflammation). I passed out as soon as my head hit the pillow. In the morning, I felt refreshed enough not to hit snooze, and a stubborn breakout on my forehead that I\u2019ve been battling for months looked calmer and less inflamed. Sure, it could be the not-so-natural antibiotics my derm prescribed (hey, this site is called Healthyish, not Tom Brady\u2019s Personal Blog) but I was delighted either way.Buy it: Moon Juice Night Beauty, $65Dermalogica Sound Sleep Cocoon Gel-CreamThe name of this night cream sold me even before I learned that the motion-activated formula releases lavender to keep you from tossing and turning. The texture is lightweight and ideal for oily skin types, and the scent is herbaceous without being overpowering. Unfortunately, this was the night the powers-that-be decided to do night work on the FDR Drive outside my apartment. I woke up, checked the time (12:51 a.m.), dug out a set of earplugs, glared at my deep-sleeping boyfriend\u2014and fell right back asleep. This is a big deal, because usually, when awakened during a REM cycle, I lie awake for hours, fuming and plotting revenge. I\u2019ve been using this stuff ever since. And even if it didn\u2019t lull me back to sleep, I\u2019d still use it for the weightless hydration.Buy it: Dermalogica Sound Sleep Cocoon Gel-Cream, $80.This Works Sleep Plus Pillow SprayThis brand is based on the premise that good sleep equals good skin, which is why their runaway bestseller is an aromatherapeutic pillow spray. The blend of lavender, vetivert, and chamomile is motion-activated to help you stay asleep (versus getting you to fall asleep in the first place). I sprayed so much of this on my pillow that it was damp, but I fell asleep fast in spite of it and only woke up a few minutes before my alarm. And the seven-and-a-half hours of uninterrupted sleep showed: There was less redness and swelling around my breakout, and my under-eye bags were nowhere to be found.After a few nights of good sleep, I started shifting my bedtime to an earlier time (so I\u2019m still an old, but now in a different way). I was impressed by the efficacy of these formulas and the fact that they actually impacted my skin. While my grape-flavored melatonin gummies help me fall asleep (and\u2014key\u2014taste like dessert) they don\u2019t really give me a glow. Post-testing, I\u2019ve still been using the Dermalogica gel-cream as my night cream, mixing up Moon Juice Night Beauty (and drinking it like a shot), and smoothing on Votary Antidote Night Oil. My skin\u2019s better for it.Buy it: This Works Sleep Plus Pillow Spray, $46.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
