I was amused though unconvinced. But the ads kept coming. Ever brighter, with more tightly branded packages and shinier websites targeted directly at me, the Millennial woman. I started to wonder if maybe, though I hadn\u2019t realized it, what was missing from my life was a cure for the common hangover.To clarify, my drinking habits range from non-existent to light. Most weeks I can count the number of drinks I have on one hand. When I do drink I get pretty tipsy after about six sips of a martini, and I\u2019m pleasantly buzzed after a glass of wine. However. I am no stranger to the hangover. Even my light drinking makes me groggy the next day, and sometimes, depending on how much fun I\u2019ve had, a little nauseous.So, a hangover cure? A little tablet to stock in my medicine cabinet, a shot of a safe vitamins and herbs that I could throw in my purse, a CBD patch that promised to help get me through the next morning\u2019s writing, spin class, or meeting sans headache and nausea? Bring it on. Besides, if these things were popular enough to be showing up on my social feeds there had to be some validity to them, right? I was dubious but intrigued.The next shiny ad that came for me I clicked. And so began my unscientific experiments with hangover recovery products.The first thing that I discovered was that there are dozens on the market. They range from capsules to IV drips to powders to shots, and have formulations from natural-leaning combinations of B vitamins and CBD, milk thistle and DHM, to the more chemically derived aspirin and synthetic caffeine. The four that appealed to me were the most ubiquitous as well as the most innocuous: Blowfish, Flyby, The Good Patch, and Morning Recovery. And all of them have legions of fans. Blowfish has a glowing reviews tab on its website. Flyby is an Amazon bestseller with over 2,000 reviews averaging 4.5 stars. Morning Recovery has a 4.9 star rating from hundreds of buyers on it\u2019s own website. People love the stuff. There are anecdotes of instantaneous alertness; waking up feeling rested and sharp instead of nauseous and groggy. And one reviewer even claims to use Flyby as migraine relief.Though the origin stories of each remedy varies, I noticed a few similarities. Both Flyby and Morning Recovery for example were born in 2017 after their respective founders traveled to Asia. Sisun Lee, founder of Morning Recovery, and Eddie Huai, founder of Flyby, separately discovered the proliferation of supplements to help ease symptoms of heavy drinking in Korea and Japan. \u201cDrinking is a huge part of corporate culture in Korea,\u201d Lee told me over the phone. \u201cAfter a late-night out in Seoul, I stumbled into a convenience store at 3:00 a.m. to stock up on bottle tonics promised to help prevent hangovers. Amazed by how effective they were, I began researching the ingredients and science behind them,\u201d he said. Lee discovered that it was DHM (dihydromyricetin) that was the secret link between the tonics. DHM is an herbal compound found in the Japaneser raisin tree and is said to help support liver detoxification, a more powerful and immediate cure for the symptoms produced by too much alcohol than say, greasy eggs, aspirin, or even Pedialyte or Gatorade.Superficially I knew that too much alcohol leads to headaches, nausea, and exhaustion, but what I didn\u2019t know was that, scientifically, an alcohol hangover is understood as when the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level in a body returns to zero after being elevated while drinking. A hangover is the body struggling in misery to return to normal. The struggle is alcohol withdrawal  coupled with dehydration and the abundance of acetaldehyde, a substance produced by the body metabolizing alcohol, have historically been pointed to as likely culprits (though a recent Dutch study disputes their role). On top of all that, drinking affects brain activity during sleep, so that helps explain why waking up exhausted is typical of a hangover.In short, the more alcohol consumed, the harsher the drop in BAC and the worse the hangover. These new remedies claim to address all the symptoms in one fell swoop, and in one small dosage.\u201cWe find that many people tend to dismiss the product as \u2018just aspirin and caffeine,\u2019\u201d Brenna Haysom of Blowfish told me. \u201cThe effervescent formulation is specifically designed for hangovers, which means it works fast and it\u2019s gentler on your stomach than aspirin pills and a cup of coffee. And at $1.50 a hangover it\u2019s cheaper than a cup of coffee.\u201dSports drinks and potassium rich foods can rehydrate, but they won\u2019t cure exhaustion. The cysteine in eggs, bacon, and even broccoli might help with the absorption of acetaldehyde, and the nausea. But DHM, the so-called liver detoxifier, is one of the secret links that supposedly ties it all together and produces a so-called cure. Similarly, aspirin or acetylsalicylic acid and synthetic caffeine does the trick of combating headaches, drowsiness, and nausea. Similarly, products like aspirin, electrolytes, and caffeine do the trick of combating.After using Morning Recovery, the brand claims, you\u2019ll feel 80 percent better. Less exhausted, less nauseous, less dizzy and less headachy. And More Labs, the company behind Morning Recovery, has done rigorous testing to support its product\u2019s claims.Ok, I thought, sounds pretty reasonable. But what did the academics and the medical community have to say? I inquired about the four specific products and their formulations. The response I got was essentially the same from all the three experts:  \u201cThere are no scientific studies published that prove that these products are effective or safe,\u201d said associate professor of pharmacology at Utrecht University, Joris C. Verster, Ph.D. \u201cCurrently, the only effective way to prevent alcohol hangovers is to moderate alcohol consumption.\u201dI also checked in with three communities of academic researchers, two based in the UK and one in the Netherlands that study the effects of alcohol in humans. The response was unilaterally the same: Caffeine and aspirin merely act as Band-Aid solutions, masking the effects of a hangover. Vitamins and DHM may be effective in some cases, but because a hangover is metabolically complicated, varying from person to person, they can hardly be considered a solution for everyone.As much as many of these products wanted to claim relief, the medical experts I spoke to told me that the science behind the brand studies is not universally accepted, and more trials need to be done. And, of course\u2014aside from Blowfish, which contains FDA-recognized ingredients\u2014as with all herbal supplements, the brand claims have not been evaluated by the FDA.To be clear, though these researchers told me that the hangover cures\u2019 claims weren\u2019t recognized by the scientific community, that doesn\u2019t mean that the brand studies are fake or unofficial. Blowfish can claim a degree of being FDA-sanctioned as its ingredients (aspirin, caffeine) are FDA-recognized, while the others are classified as herbal supplements, which don't require FDA approval. It\u2019s all very complicated.But back to my unscientific study, where there were no double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trials at all. Instead, I invited seven friends over for dinner and to drink plenty of alcohol. Most of the seven were runners or Pilates obsessives. All in their 30s, at least three considered themselves heavier social drinkers while the other four were the nurse-a-glass types. We all get hangovers, and many of us admittedly get very bad ones, the kind that leave you in a sad state of never getting out of pajamas and watching The Real Housewives of Whatever all day.When my guests and test subjects arrived, I handed out Morning Recovery, which comes in pretty little blue bottles and can be consumed right before your first alcoholic drink, between drinks, or up to one hour after your last one. It\u2019s a mostly herbal mix of ginseng, electrolytes, vitamins, and DHM. I also supplied my guests with effervescent tablets of Blowfish, a mix of aspirin and caffeine, whose website has an illustration of a youngish looking person lying face down on the ground. \u201cUpon waking [the morning after a night of drinking],\u201d say the instructions, \u201cdissolve one or two tablets in a 16 oz. glass water and drink.\u201d All the guests used one of the two remedies as instructed.Over the course of dinner\u2014which involved ample creamy hummus, sourdough, steak, and an apple cake for dessert\u2014we drank eight bottles of wine, then followed it all with amaro.The next day I asked for feedback on the hangovers. The reviews were mixed. They ranged from \u201cWorst hangover ever\u201d to \u201cMaybe? I feel like it worked? I\u2019m less impaired than I would be ordinarily\u201d to \u201cIt did something. I still feel groggy, but not nauseous and don\u2019t have a headache.\u201dI also heard, \u201cI have no idea. Don\u2019t feel any different, but I did go home and drink more beers than I can count with my roommate.\u201dNothing conclusive to report there.As for me, I went with Blowfish and it did absolutely nothing. Headache and near-vomiting were still present. Though I\u2019d given it a chance, like Brenna Haysom said I should while cautioning not to consider it just an aspirin and caffeine, that\u2019s exactly what it felt like.But I continued my unscientific studies. Over the next few weeks, any time I had three or four drinks, I tried a new hangover remedy.After using Flyby I woke up without a headache or a turning stomach. Still exhausted, but I wasn\u2019t expecting miracles. And, Flyby is primarily a supplement made from a spectrum of B vitamins, amino acids, ginseng, and DHM, so I might start popping the capsules daily, drinking or not.My few swigs of Morning Recovery probably canceled out even a fair unscientific trial, but for what it's worth, I did try it, and I didn\u2019t notice anything. My boyfriend and another of my party guests, however, thought it worked well.The Good Patch, comprised of B vitamins and 15 mg of premium hemp extract was my favorite, even though it itched when I first put it on. The day after using it I shocked myself by running a full eight miles on only four hours of sleep without a headache or nausea.But would Alka-Seltzer, a multivitamin, and a banana have done the same? Really hard to say.I do know that what might work for me might not work for you. Our hangovers are unique to our genetic makeup. Turns out some of us are more lucky in that regard than others. I will say that even though all the scientists told me it\u2019s nonsense, I can see myself stocking a few Good Patches and Flybys for the holiday season, or maybe even for the occasional run-of-the-mill Saturday night. In fact, I might drink two glasses of cloudy p\u00e9t-nat to that right now.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHangover CuresTrendsRead MoreshoppingThe Fruit That Doubles As My Hangover CureBy Kiki FlynnRecipes you want to make.
