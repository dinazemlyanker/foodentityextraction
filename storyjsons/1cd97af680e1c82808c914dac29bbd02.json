Tahini is everywhere. But what is tahini, really? It used to be an ingredient that was obscure and exotic to a lot of American home cooks, but now it\u2019s practically ubiquitous; these days you're just as likely to find it in your hummus or salad dressing as you are to see it swirled into brownies or drizzled over fruit at a cool, healthyish restaurant. We need to understand it. And understand it we shall.You might already know that tahini comes from sesame seeds. Congratulations. You are on the path to true tahini enlightenment (TTE for those in the industry. JK, not really.). If you were to describe tahini to a third grader, you\u2019d say, \u201cTahini is ground, toasted sesame seeds.\u201d They\u2019d understand, and then you\u2019d keep talking to them about Pok\u00e9mon. But we\u2019re going to give you a little more credit than your third grade friend. We\u2019re moving past the ground sesame seed thing.There\u2019s a difference between good and bad tahini. The best tahini is mildly nutty, creamy, and savory\u2014you should want to eat it with a spoon. It's rich and luxurious, with a texture like a loose nut butter. Bad tahini, on the other hand, can be bitter and astringent, bordering on acidic, and can be dry with an almost chalky mouthfeel. Which is all to say, it's important to grab the best you can when you're strutting through the aisles at your local grocery store. Trusting a brand is the easiest way to avoid a negative tahini experience, which everyone dipping their freshly toasted pita at your party will appreciate.If you\u2019re the type of person who\u2019s down to order something online (maybe by the case) because it\u2019s the best, Soom tahini is what you\u2019re after. We happen to think it has the perfect texture and flavor, but don't take our word for it\u2014it's the only tahini that chef Mike Solomonov uses at Zahav, his famed Israeli restaurant in Philadelphia, and Dizengoff, his chain of hummus restaurants. When it comes down to it, you can use Soom tahini just as you\u2019d use peanut butter. (They have a tasty chocolate version too.) It\u2019s our favorite tahini around. But it you\u2019re looking for a quick pick-up at the grocery store, Whole Foods 365 brand tahini and Roland tahini are both great options. You might also come across black tahini, which is tahini made from black sesame seeds and has a darker, more intensely roasted flavor.Tahini cookies. Yeah.\nPhoto by Laura Murray, styling by Judy ManciniSo now you have the good stuff. What do you do with it? Well, remember how we said you can essentially use it like peanut butter? Yeah, do that. Swirling tahini into cakes and brownies creates cool patterns and a nutty flavor. Baking it into cookies takes you down a similar but different path than a classic peanut butter cookie. You can also use it to create some heft and mild, toasty flavor in creamy salad dressings and vegetable dips, or you can add it to sauces for stir-fried noodles or vegetables. A quick spread over some toast with honey or bunch of pickles works well too. And yeah, of course, there\u2019s always hummus.Whether you\u2019re swirling, drizzling,  mixing, dipping, or swimming in it, tahini is a lot easier to get into your dinner game plan than you think.This isn't some specialty ingredient that should sit in the back of your fridge for a couple months after you use it once. It's worth more than that. Tahini is a giver. You just need to accept its love.Buy a 4-Pack of Soom Tahini right now on Amazon for $32.80We know you've been thinking about hummus for the last four paragraphs.Let\u2019s Do This: Easy Homemade HummusHow to get it nice and smooth\u2014and you might never buy it again.View StoryExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyTahiniHummusSesame SeedRecipes you want to make.
