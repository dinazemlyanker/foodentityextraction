There,\u00a0the warmer months are all about chilled miso ramen, a miraculously refreshing (and vegan!) bowl of springy noodles and lightly dressed farmers\u2019 market veg bathed in a frosty, funky-salty-sweet broth. The experience of slurping down a bowl of the stuff is at once entirely different and bizarrely similar to that of tucking into the chef\u2019s signature hot, chicken broth-based torigara ramen.\u00a0And, as it turns out, that's the point.\u201cThe beauty of ramen, what people love about it, is the texture, both of the broth and the noodles,\u201d Nakamura explained. Like any obsessive ramen chef worth his\u00a0shoyu, he often uses a tool called a refractometer, used for measuring the relative dissolved solids in a liquid, to make sure that all of his broths have just the right consistency. High-quality soy milk\u00a0provides the ideal platform for a flavorful, richly-textured cold soup. (Nakamura uses a boutique-y Japanese brand that costs upwards of $20 per quart, but we\u2019ve had great results in our test kitchen with nationally-available Silk Unsweetened.)To that, he adds a homemade miso\u00a0tare\u2014an elaborate combination of funky fermented soy, scallions, ginger, garlic, apple, sake, vinegar, and chile\u2014which transforms the delicate milk into an eyebrow-raisingly complex umami powerhouse. The\u00a0big-tasting broth gets poured over ramen noodles that have been cooked to an al dente springiness and then shocked in ice water,\u00a0then the bowl gets crowned with a riot of seasonal veggies dressed lightly in a tingly Sichuan chile paste that change over the course of the summer. \u201cYou have to adjust your ingredients with each season,\u201d Nakamura notes. \u201cRight now, I focus on summer ingredients like basil, tomato, and\u00a0cucumber,\u201d but okra, corn, radishes, and raw tender greens are all fair game.The result, which the chef calls \u201cperfect lunch ramen,\u201d is unlike anything we had ever tasted. And while the recipe is fairly intricate, all of the constituent parts\u2014the miso\u00a0tare, that addictive Sichuan chile paste\u2014are very stable, meaning they can be doubled or tripled, parked in the fridge, and deployed whenever the mercury spikes and a cold ramen craving hits. And, trust us: It will hit.Get the recipe:Chilled Ramen with Soy Milk and Chili OilBecause nothing will stop us from eating ramen all year long.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishRamenSummerRead MorecookingThese Misos Have Nothing to Do With SoybeansBy Amiel StanekRecipes you want to make.
