These DIY Spice Blends Are the Easiest UpgradeThere's a major difference between store-bought powdered spice blends and ones you make from scratch.By Priya KrishnaNovember 30, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailI am going to let you in on a secret: Most of those bottled spice blends you are buying from your grocery store are nothing more than lightly fragranced sawdust, as far as I'm concerned. By the time that packaged garam masala or curry powder hits shelves, the spices in it are usually pretty old, and have lost much of their potency.Let me the first to admit that I have occasionally dabbled in bottled garam masala. A roommate once bought it to make a dish, and in a desperate weeknight cooking moment I grabbed it from the cupboard and dusted it atop a bland stir-fry that needed some oomph. But I knew the truth\u2014that while bottled garam masala gets the job done in terms of adding some mild flavor to a dish, nothing holds a candle to a homemade spice mix. When you start with whole, freshly toasted spices, you are getting the most bang for your buck, flavor-wise. Your dishes will taste (and smell) infinitely more complex. They\u2019ll have depth. Your guests will be all, YOU\u2026cooked\u2026THIS??? It\u2019s amazing what whole spices can do.The thought of making your own spice blend may feel daunting. Trust me when I say: It is not that difficult! Spice blends are about as hard to make as a dip, which is to say you need only know how to lightly cook and combine a few things. You can make dip, can\u2019t you?The other misnomer about spice blends is that they involve dozens of different ingredients. This is true about some spice blends, but not all. And not my mom\u2019s spice blends. When she was a working mother of two who came home at 6 and had to have dinner on the table by 6:30, you can bet she was not concocting complicated combinations of spices. Instead, she had a few simple go-to combinations that each worked in different types of dishes.A general rule with all of these mixes is to always toast your spices on low heat (to prevent burning) just until they are fragrant. Blending can easily be done in a mortar and pestle, spice grinder (my parents swear by the Hamilton Beach coffee grinder for getting the job done), or, in a pinch, a Ziploc bag and the bottom of a whipped cream can (my go-to method in my tiny college apartment). That said, my mom occasionally prefers to keep some spices whole, for texture and more intense flavor (and hey, less work).Here are a few of my mom\u2019s starter blends\u2014three-ingredient combos that are easy to make and endlessly versatile. They'll turn you off the bottled stuff for good.Coriander, Cardamom, and CuminHow to make it: Toast 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, 2 teaspoons coriander seeds, and \u00bd teaspoon green cardamom pods in a small pan on low heat until fragrant.
