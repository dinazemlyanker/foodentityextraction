And there are restaurant lists with purpose. This is the latter.By The Bon App\u00e9tit StaffMarch 3, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Laura MurrayFacebookTwitterEmailThere\u2019s no single best restaurant in New York. There\u2019s only the best restaurant for your situation. Hence the NYC100, our heavily vetted recommendations for where to eat and drink in every scenario you find yourself in. What type of food? What neighborhood? How many people? Is there a vegan in the group? Beer? Wine? Liquor? Here we deliver a list of the spots we rely on to satisfy all of our very specific needs.Want these recs on a map? Right this way\u2026.New to the list 8/6/2019: New Asha, Gino\u2019s Pastry Shop, Arepa Lady, Louie & Ernie\u2019sNew to the list 9/5/2019: Cho Dang Gol, Silver Rice, Ganesh Temple, Bernie\u2019sNew to the list 10/8/2019: Pakistan Tea HouseNew to the list 11/11/2019: Teranga, F&F PizzeriaNew to the list 12/10/2019: Kindred, WaylaNew to the list 1/16/2020: Nami Nori, Golden DinerNew to the list 2/7/2020: JoloffNew to the list 3/3/2020: Zooba, La Esquina Del Camar\u00f3n MexicanoThere\u2019s a reason the scrambled eggs with lox hasn\u2019t changed.\n1. The Place for Old-School Vibes That Are Actually Old-SchoolBarney GreengrassUpper West Side, ManhattanThe average age of a Barney Greengrass patron probably hovers around 67. The restaurant still keeps monthly tabs for regulars (the New Yorker\u2019s David Remnick being one of them). The gold, panoramic wallpaper looks like it could tell you about the turn of the century (the 20th one). And the recipe for the scrambled eggs with Nova lox hasn\u2019t changed in decades. The timelessness of this uptown Jewish deli is about three-quarters of the charm. The other quarter is made up of whatever wisecracks your veteran waiter is sure to dole out.\u2735 Order: latkes, whitefish salad, bagels or toasted bialys, scrambled eggs with Nova and onions, and coffee.2. The Place for the Opposite of Brunch: Japanese BreakfastOkonomiWilliamsburg, BrooklynAt this tiny 12-seat spot, there is only one order: chef Yuji Haraguchi\u2019s simple but spectacular Japanese breakfast set. That spread of miso-and-sake-kasu-slicked fish (like Spanish mackerel or tuna belly), jiggly tamago (omelet), pickles, miso soup, and rice is served on beautiful porcelain worthy of the morning light streaming through the windows.\u2735 Order: the breakfast set; and yes, you want to add the roe and soft-cooked egg to the rice.3. The Place for the Quintessential American Diner ExperienceTom\u2019s RestaurantProspect Heights, BrooklynWake up early to avoid the weekend line and you\u2019ll be rewarded with a sodium bomb of corned beef, bottomless cups of passable coffee, and absurdly crispy diner fries. The fluffiest pancake rumors are true, and the Christmas d\u00e9cor comes down for no season. After all, who can resist that kind of cheer? Bring cash!\u2735 Order: corned beef hash (extra-crispy, add a slice of American cheese) and eggs (scrambled, light), a side of fries, a side stack of pancakes, and a chocolate egg cream.4. The Place for Chicken, Waffles, and a Religious ExperienceSylvia\u2019sHarlem, ManhattanMore than 50 years after it opened, this Harlem institution is hallowed ground. Sure, there are gospel singers and crowds that make getting a table for (post-church) Sunday brunch a challenge, but the most intensely religious experience is the soul food itself. Good things come to those who wait.\u2735 Order: chicken and waffles and Sylvia\u2019s World Famous Talked About Bar-B-Que Ribs.5. The Place Where Soft-Scrambled Eggs Can\u2019t Get any SofterBuvetteWest Village, ManhattanThis place is so cramped even the sidewalk outside the front door is crowded. But inside the perfectly worn room, no one cares, because the scrambled eggs coming out of Jody Williams\u2019 kitchen are truly the softest, fluffiest, most buttery eggs in New York. Show up early (read: 7 a.m.\u2014especially on weekends) and grab a seat at the white marble bar, right next to the towers of juice and scones, for a full view of said eggs being cooked using the steam wand on the espresso machine.\u2735 Order: saumon fum\u00e9 (steamed eggs with smoked salmon) and an espresso.6. The Place for When Your Anchovy Craving Hits First Thing in the MorningKopitiamLower East Side, ManhattanThe Lower East Side\u2019s coolest breakfast spot is a casual coffeehouse serving intensely flavorful Chinese-influenced Malaysian dishes known as Nyonya cuisine, loaded with anchovies, shrimp paste, and fish sauce. Tables turn quickly in the always-bustling space, so if you show up to a full house, just wait a minute for a seat to open up. Order as many plates and bowls as will fit on your table: Dishes are on the smaller side, easy to share, and guaranteed to be devoured.\u2735 Order: nasi lemak (coconut rice with crunchy anchovies and hard-boiled eggs), pan mee (hand-pulled noodle soup), and Malaysian-style French toast.7. The Place for When Diner Cuisine Is First on the To-Do ListNeil\u2019s Coffee ShopUpper East Side, ManhattanThe red neon \u201ccoffee shop\u201d sign, hanging on the corner of 70th and Lexington, is a beautiful lie. There\u2019s no fancy espresso machine in sight here\u2014just a diner with a massive menu of breakfast classics. The same exact waitstaff has been here for decades, serving neighborhood locals, kids fresh off Central Park\u2019s Little League fields, construction workers, and confused French tourists. If New York were a restaurant, it would be Neil\u2019s.\u2735 Order: You can\u2019t go wrong. Just don\u2019t miss Neil\u2019s exceptional breakfast sausage.8. The Place to Flag Down Delicious Dim SumPacificanaSunset Park, BrooklynThis large ballroom looks like it came straight out of Beauty and the Beast (ceiling moldings, chandeliers, gold accents) and is sacred ground for dim sum lovers. But it\u2019s also a lesson in strategy: When a cart comes by with the best stuff\u2014shu mai, har cheung (rice noodle rolls), dan tat (egg tarts)\u2014don\u2019t hesitate for a moment. Eyes on the prize!\u2735 Order: cold jellyfish, spare ribs with squash, chicken feet, shu mai, har gow (shrimp dumplings), har cheung, and dan tat.9. The Place for When Your Friends Force You to Go to BrunchAtlaNoho, ManhattanThe best kind of brunch menu is one that reads like a lunch menu. And that's exactly why Enrique Olvera and Daniela Soto-Innes\u2019 Mexican spot Atla is the only answer to the dreaded \u201cWhere should we do brunch?\u201d text. The narrow, light-filled room is miraculously devoid of loud groups looking to get their bottomless mimosa fix\u2014a rare find in the syrup-drenched, two-hour-wait brunch landscape of lower Manhattan.\u2735 Order: flaxseed chilaquiles, chicken enchiladas (get green and red, a.k.a. divorciadas), arctic char and farmer\u2019s cheese tostada, and the fish Milanese.10. The Place to Witness a Classic, Storied Well-Oiled MachineBalthazarSoho, ManhattanEveryone has been to Balthazar. And everyone still goes to Balthazar. Locals. Tourists. Chefs. Downtown cool kids. Uptown grandparents. After 20-plus years, the classic French brasserie remains a New York institution thanks to its consistency and efficiency. Spend just as much time looking around the timeless room as you do admiring the precision of your omelet\u2019s roll.\u2735 Order: omelet with herbs, smoked salmon tartine, and a plate of breakfast oysters.11. The Place for Mole Poblano Tamales and Immediate Hangover ReliefFactory TamalLower East Side, ManhattanIf you\u2019re the type of person who is comfortable standing on the sidewalk, face down in a brown paper bag of steaming, saucy tamales the morning after an ambitious evening out on the town, you\u2019ve come to the right place. If you\u2019d prefer to be sitting\u2014out of sight from passersby\u2014Factory Tamal has some seats inside too. Either way, this should be your first move, after the Advil of course.\u2735 Order: mole poblano tamal, salsa verde tamal, chipotle tamal, and the (off menu) Ludlow breakfast sandwich.The chicken katsu club at Golden Diner\nPhoto by Laura Murray12. The Place For Breakfast at 4 p.m. and Lunch at 10 a.m.Golden DinerTwo BridgesThere\u2019s nowhere we\u2019d rather disobey traditional meal times than at Golden Diner. A super crispy chicken katsu club first thing in the morning? Honey butter pancakes with honey maple butter at 3:30 in the afternoon? YOU CAN DO IT. The menu has something for everyone, without being intimidatingly long, and is served seven days from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. All that means we love it here for lunch, and for breakfast and dinner, too\u2014no matter what time of the day you\u2019re having it.\u2735 Order: the Chinatown egg & cheese sandwich on a scallion milk bun, chicken katsu club, side of super crispy home fries, turmeric-lemongrass avocado toast (for real), and the cheeseburger.13. The Place for Fresh-Baked Naan and a Cold Can of CokePakistan Tea HouseTribeca, ManhattanThis place is small. The tables are few. And the beverage list consists of canned soda and bottled water. And that\u2019s all perfect, because Pakistan Tea House isn\u2019t a place for glitz and glamour. It\u2019s the spot for ripping hot naan, quick service, and consistently excellent, absurdly flavorful steam table Indo-Pakistani food. Even better? It\u2019s open 24 hours a day, making it popular with Tribeca office workers in the afternoon and hungry cabbies in the early morning hours. Unless we have one of those kinds of nights, we\u2019re usually there for an I\u2019ve got a meeting in 30 minutes, but need a real lunch lunch.\u2735 Order: Chicken curry combo special with stewed eggplant and saag, naan, chicken seekh kebab, yogurt sauce, and a cold can of Coke.14. The Place for When You Need a Cheesy, Meaty Arepa and You Need It NowArepa LadyJackson Heights, QueensIt didn\u2019t take long for New Yorkers to fall in love with Maria Cano, a.k.a. the \u201cArepa Lady,\u201d when she first launched her food cart in Queens in the 1980s. And while the business has grown over the years, with Maria and her sons moving their operation into new brick-and-mortar spaces (including a stand at Brooklyn\u2019s DeKalb Market), not too much has changed. You can still find the same deeply satisfying corn cakes stuffed with cheeses and meats that built their reputation in the first place. It\u2019s just that with all this added elbow room, it\u2019s even easier to stroll in for lunch with say, seven of your closest friends and get seated (read: start eating) right away.\u2735 Order: arepa de queso with chorizo, and arepa rellena with pollo asado. Make use all of the brightly colored hot and creamy sauces out on the tables.15. The Place for Seafood Tostadas in the Back of a Queens BodegaLa Esquina Del Camar\u00f3n MexicanoJackson Heights, QueensThose searching for New York\u2019s tastiest seafood tostadas know not to look for the storefront by name. That\u2019s because La Esquina takes up just a small sliver of Roosevelt Deli, with just six seats and a menu of empanadas, tostadas, tacos, and other fish and seafood specialties. Bring cash, an appetite, and just one lucky friend\u2014space is tight and those few seats sought after. But if you can\u2019t get a spot while you crunch on shatteringly crisp tortillas, don\u2019t sweat it. These tostadas taste just as good eaten on the sidewalk.\u2735 Order: Tostada de pulpo (octopus) drizzled with aguacate, flautas de caz\u00f3n (marinated dogfish), shrimp cocktail, and a soda from the bodega fridge.16. The Place for Off-the-Wall Design and Egyptian Comfort FoodZoobaSoHo, ManhattanYou\u2019ll fall in love with Zooba before you even taste the food, thanks to all the delightful details\u2014graphic murals, wheatpaste-style posters, colorful LED patterns on the ceiling\u2014inspired by the streets of Cairo. But this fast-casual spot serving Egyptian street-food classics is more than a feast for the eyes. The ta\u2019ameya (freshly fried balls of mashed fava beans), hawashi (a tender meat-veg patty stuffed in fluffy baladi bread), and dips come in a variety of flavors and options, including easy-to-tote salads and sandwiches. Though, with this much to look at, you might choose to grab a seat and stick around.\u2735 Order: Ful medames (stewed fava beans), za\u2019atar fries, cheese hawashi, and pickled lemon ta\u2019ameya.17. The Place for a Pepperoni Slice in What Feels Like Your Uncle\u2019s BasementLouie & Ernie\u2019sSchuylerville, The BronxLouie & Ernie\u2019s is a residential kind of joint. The neighborhood feels suburban; the building looks like a house. And walking down into the semi-subterranean room is a lot like dropping by your uncle\u2019s place for lunch\u2014if your uncle also happened to serve some of the best New York\u2013style pizza in the city. Grab a couple of slices, some garlic knots, and head to the back patio where the cozy, relaxed vibes stay strong.\u2735 Order: slices of plain, pepperoni, and sausage pizzas; garlic knots; and a cold soda.18. The Place for a Very Serene, Very Life-Affirming LunchRakuEast Village, ManhattanSometimes in this eight-million-person city, you just need some peace, quiet, and udon. That\u2019s when you head to this subdued, intimate noodle shop, where there\u2019s jazz on the speakers and beautiful ceramic bowls of thick, chewy, satisfying udon imported from Japan.\u2735 Order: yaki nasu (fried eggplant with spicy miso pork and egg), the cold zaru udon (with seaweed, quail egg, and scallions) or hot kitsune udon (with sweet fried bean curd).19. The Place That Serves a Sandwich for EveryoneCourt Street GrocersCarroll Gardens, Red Hook, and Williamsburg, Brooklyn; and Greenwich Village, ManhattanThe menu might seem intimidating at first\u2014there are a lot of sandwiches\u2014but once you make your way through the list, you\u2019ll realize each item has earned its place. Whether it\u2019s eggy, vegetarian, toasty, or cold cuts-y, Court Street nails it.\u2735 Order: broccoli Reuben, turkey club, pork roll breakfast sandwich, and a house-made celery soda.20. The Place for Convincing Your Southern Friends that NYC Does, in Fact, Have Phenomenal BarbecueHometown Bar-B-QueRed Hook, BrooklynThe brisket is just as good as what you\u2019d find in Texas\u2019s top barbecue joints, the beef rib is truly a spectacle to behold, and the sides are legitimately great. Lines are long, and there\u2019s a reason for that. Listen to the live music on weekend nights and wait it out.\u2735 Order: beef ribs, brisket, lamb belly, queso mac & cheese, potato salad, and cornbread.21. The Place for Steamed Dumplings in a Flushing BasementTian Jin Dumpling HouseFlushing, QueensThe only less-than-wonderful part of Tian Jin is finding it for the first time. The compact dumpling spot is buried in the basement food court of the Golden Shopping Mall. But once you descend into the space, the thick-skinned steamed dumplings are all you\u2019ll be thinking about. The dumplings are chewy and soft, and the meats and vegetables wrapped inside are seasoned aggressively. Sit at the counter and make use of the chili oil.\u2735 Order: lamb and squash dumplings, pork and cabbage dumplings, and pork, shrimp, and chive dumplings.22. The Place When You\u2019re at Chelsea Market and Need to Shovel Something in Your FaceLos Tacos No. 1Chelsea, ManhattanIf you\u2019re in Chelsea Market and not having a crowd/stroller/lost tourists\u2013induced panic attack, chances are you just ate at Los Tacos No. 1, where the tacos taste as good as the braised and roast meats smell. Plus, it comes on some of the best flour tortillas in the city, which can also be found at its sister restaurant Los Mariscos, just down the hall.\u2735 Order: adobada tacos, pollo asado quesadilla, nopal plate, and chips with guacamole.A bright a vibrant bowl from Teranga.\nPhoto by Emma Fishman23. The Place for West African Staples Right Off Central ParkTerangaHarlem, ManhattanWho serves New York\u2019s best jollof, a pot of deep red grains cooked with caramelized tomato paste and crowned with diced onions, carrots, and peas? That\u2019s a heated question. But chef Pierre Thiam\u2019s airy all-day caf\u00e9 Teranga in Harlem is a top contender. The build-your-own format of the fast-casual spot leaves the construction of a bowl of West African dishes up to you, and you\u2019ll wish you had seconds before you\u2019ve even finished what\u2019s on your tray. Just make sure you don\u2019t get too far without employing the four condiments set out on the table\u2014they\u2019re not to be missed.\u2735 Order: Jollof, garlicky grilled chicken, caramelized plantains, herby black-eyed pea salad, and mafe (a velvety, peanut-y stew).24. The Place for Lunch Pasta, Instead of Dinner PastaVia CarotaWest Village, ManhattanIt\u2019s not that Via Carota isn\u2019t a dream dinner place. It\u2019s just that we prefer to head in around noon for lunch, when a long daytime meal in Jody Williams and Rita Sodi\u2019s stylish dining room makes us feel like we\u2019re some West Village celebrity, Italian movie star, or power-lunching media mogul. Oh, and the wait\u2014which can stretch up to three hours in the evening\u2014is much more reasonable this time of day. Like Williams\u2019 and Sodi\u2019s other restaurants in the neighborhood (I Sodi, Buvette, and the new Bar Pisellino), it\u2019s worth holding out for.\u2735 Order: the towering, not-so-typical green salad, cacio e pepe, a few items from the menu\u2019s seasonal Verdure section (e.g. fried artichokes, grilled octopus), and a Negroni.25. The Place for When Staten Island Is the Quickest Way to Sri LankaNew AshaTompkinsville, Staten IslandIf you want to eat Sri Lankan food in New York City, you go to Staten Island. And if that\u2019s your agenda, you should head to New Asha, a small, humble restaurant serving deeply flavorful curries, hand pies, and kottu roti (a stir-fried dish made with torn, flaky flatbread). Keep in mind that each bracingly fiery, pickle-y, sour-y dish comes piled high on Styrofoam plates, making a nap on the ferry home an inevitable (and welcome) ending to the feast.\u2735 Order: mutton roll (a savory hand pie), chicken curry, mutton kottu, and string hoppers (steamed rice noodles).26. The Place Where the Best Dishes on the Menu Are FreeCho Dang GolKoreatown, ManhattanThey say you should be able to judge a Korean restaurant by its banchan, the welcome wave of small, highly seasoned, free dishes that arrive at the start of a meal to stoke your appetite. And at this homey, low-key spot a few blocks north of the main K-Town stretch on 32nd Street, all signs point to top marks. A small bowl of delicate house-made tofu curds. Wheels of sticky-sweet braised lotus root. Zucchini rounds battered in egg. Cucumber-seaweed salad. And more. All before you\u2019ve even had a moment to look at the stews.\u2735 Order: mini bossam, dumpling jeongol (a hot pot you should split with a group), seafood stew, kimchi biji (a thick and spicy soybean stew), and extra banchan (it\u2019s free!).27. The Place When You Have $2.50 and Want to Know How Good a Cecina Taco Can BeSanta Ana Deli & GroceryBushwick, BrooklynUp front, Mexican sodas, snacks, and beers can be grabbed from ramshackle shelves. In the back, a small griddle where meats are sizzled and seared before they\u2019re slapped onto soft flour tortillas and topped with thinly sliced vegetables. Don\u2019t forget to ask for red and green salsas with everything you order.\u2735 Order: cecina (salty beef jerky) tacos and crispy carnitas tacos with plenty of limes.28. The Place to Go With or Without Your Vegetarian FriendsSuperiority BurgerEast Village, ManhattanA vegetarian burger joint that meat-eaters love? However unlikely it may sound, it\u2019s real. (And there\u2019s nothing particularly healthy about it\u2014in a good way.) Brooks Headley\u2019s veggie burgers are all kinds of flavorful, from the dill pickles to the Muenster cheese to the kind-of-spicy patty. The tiny spot is almost always slammed, so take your haul half a block down 9th Street to a bench in Tompkins Square Park and get in some prime people watching at the same time.\u2735 Order: Superiority Burger, burnt broccoli salad, and whatever mind-blowing gelato/sorbet is on the menu.29. The Place for Crowd-Pleasing Vegan FoodBunna CafeBushwick, BrooklynThis bustling, 100-percent plant-based Ethiopian spot is the ultimate answer to the age-old question, \u201cWhere are we going to take our vegetarian friends to dinner?\u201d Sixteen bucks gets you a hubcap-size platter loaded with all manner of hearty, stewy, elaborately spiced vegetables and legumes piled atop supple, tangy injera. It\u2019s more than enough for four hungry people. Eating with your hands, throwing back a couple of St. George Lagers, you\u2019ll suddenly have a reason to be grateful for friends with dietary restrictions.\u2735 Order: lentil sambusas, Lunch for 2 (enough to feed three, depending on hunger levels).30. The Place to Fall in Love with Uzbek-Uyghur FoodCafe KashkarBrighton Beach, BrooklynYou love Uzbek-Uyghur food; you might just not know it yet. Chewy-tender hand-pulled noodles piled high with chunks of coriander-and-cumin-seasoned lamb. Flaky disks of pastry stuffed with tender bits of lamb and herbs. Juicy, fist-size steamed dumplings spilling forth with...more lamb. Okay: You may not love Uzbek-Uyghur food if you dislike lamb. But if you do, get thee to Brighton!\u2735 Order: geiro lagman (noodles with lamb and peppers), manti (small lamb dumplings), samsas (meat pastries).31. The Place for Massive Dosas in the Basement of a Hindu TempleGanesh Temple CanteenMurray Hill, QueensYou might not have known that some of the greatest dosas in New York City are being served in the basement cafeteria of a Hindu Temple in Queens. Well, folks...now ya\u2019 know. Enter the main doors and follow the signs pointing you toward the \u201cTemple Canteen\u201d\u2014through the ornate, stone pillar-lined halls and down a flight of stairs\u2014into a large, starkly lit cafeteria filled with folding tables and chairs. There you\u2019ll find an expansive, all-vegetarian menu of South Indian specialties. Everything on the menu comes in under $7.50 (and with a side of spicy ground coconut chutney and sambar, a brothy lentil gravy) which means you should show up with a group and order liberally.\u2735 Order: The paper dosa (it\u2019s huge!), spicy butter paneer dosa, idli (steamed lentil cakes), and vada (deep fried lentil doughnuts).32. The Place When You\u2019re in Times Square and Just Need Some Damn LunchMargon RestaurantTimes Square, ManhattanThis narrow spot on 46th Street shines brightly in the food desert known as Times Square. Margon serves Cuban classics from a long line of steam trays to construction workers, 9-to-5ers, tourists, and costumed superheroes alike. The Cuban sandwich is perfectly crispy and nothing close to healthy (as it should be).\u2735 Order: Cuban sandwich combo (with rice and beans), roast chicken, rice and beans, maduros.33. The Place to BYOB Natty Wine and Eat a Rotisserie ChickenCasa AdelaAlphabet City, ManhattanAs any Philly or Chicago transplant can attest, BYOB joints are a rare commodity in NYC. Which is all the more reason why we\u2019re grateful for Casa Adela. When you sit down on a not-so-comfortable chair and look around at the families passing rotisserie chickens, tostones, and mofongo over glass-covered vinyl tablecloths, you\u2019ll understand the appeal: This is the place to go for real, honest, comforting Puerto Rican cooking. Discovery Wines and Alphabet City Wine Co. are both conveniently within walking distance, so don\u2019t forget to snag a bottle or two on your way.\u2735 Order: half rotisserie chicken, carne guisada, chicharron de pollo, and pernil asado.At Frenchette, it\u2019s all in the details.\nPhoto by Heidi's Bridge34. The Place for a Big Night Out on Someone Else\u2019s DimeFrenchetteTribeca, ManhattanAssume the duck frites are happening, and then treat the rest of the menu at this new-school French bistro as a to-do list (boudin blanc, roast chicken for two on a plank of garlic-butter baguette) and get to work. Dive into a hard-to-find bottle of biodynamic wine from one of the best lists in the city. Keep an eye out for celebrities and powerful people. Then play it cool. Tonight, you\u2019re one of them.\u2735 Order: duck frites (duh), roast chicken, boudin blanc, softly scrambled eggs with garlicky snails, and Paris-brest \u00e0 la pistache.35. The Place for a Perfect Slice Created by LegendsF&F PizzeriaCarroll Gardens, BrooklynIn a city filled with slice shops, who needs another, right? Wrong. With dough formulated and fermented by Tartine\u2019s Chad Roberston, pie technique and construction nailed down by pizza legend Chris Bianco, and a space owned and operated by Carroll Gardens legends Frank Falcinelli and Frank Castronovo, F&F is the spot for the crispy, chewy, cheesy, perfectly balanced Brooklyn slice you\u2019ve been looking for. It\u2019s also the one everyone else is looking for, so go early and expect a line.\u2735 Order: A plain slice, a tomato slice, and a Sicilian pepperoni slice.36. The Place for West African Classics and Family-Dinner VibesJoloffBed-Stuy, BrooklynNo, you haven\u2019t just walked into your aunt and uncle\u2019s living room, but at Joloff, it sure will feel like it. The patterned textile tablecloths, turquoise walls, and black-and-white portraits all make for a laid-back, homey environment run by a staff that\u2019s warm and familiar. The food\u2014a wide selection of deeply comforting West African dishes like tamarind-laced lamb shank, vegetarian okra stew, and jollof\u2014only makes it feel cozier. Bring friends: The portions are generous and it\u2019s best to order family style to appreciate the restaurant\u2019s breadth.\u2735 Order: Mafe Yapp (a ridiculously tender lamb stewed in a velvety peanut-based sauce) with jollof rice and a bissap (hibiscus juice).37. The Place to Order Over-the-Top Hand Rolls With AbandonNami NoriWest VillageYou\u2019ll be incredibly tempted to order one of every temaki (Japanese-style hand roll) upon first read-through of the dynamic menu at this spare yet stylish counter from Masa alums. And really, we don\u2019t love having to choose: Buttery scallops in XO sauce? Creamy squash enlivened with ginger and scallion? Or huge pearls of salmon roe? The good news is, each fist-size package with warm white rice and perfectly crisp nori is so thoughtfully made that you can\u2019t go wrong. And better yet: They\u2019re just small enough that you can easily put down a few of them, and still have room to go back for more.\u2735 Order: scallop with XO sauce, vegan ginger-scallion squash, spicy sea bass with daikon, uni, spicy crab dynamite, and ikura hand rolls, plus calamari with yuzu soy and nori chips.38. The Place to Go for New York\u2019s Timeless CheeseburgerJ.G. MelonUpper East Side, ManhattanThe watermelon-themed decorations, green-checked tablecloths, and long-time employees give this legendary burger joint a vibe that feels permanent in the most special way, just like the years of seasoning that coat the sizzling griddle. It\u2019s impossible to not feel like a true New Yorker when eating a burger at the original Upper East Side location (there are now two others in Manhattan). It\u2019s an institution.\u2735 Order: cheeseburger, cottage fries, chili (for dipping your fries), and a martini.39. The Place for an Easy Dinner in the Hardest Neighborhood, Times SquareOotoyaTimes Square, Manhattan.No matter how crowded this homestyle Japanese restaurant is, it feels like a respite from a world where you are at permanent risk of being accosted by an adult dressed like a furry animal. Whether you\u2019re going post-work or pre-theater, Ootoya\u2019s generous portions of extra-crispy tonkatsu (fried pork cutlet) or simple preparations of grilled fish (like mackerel) have restorative properties.\u2735 Order: tonkatsu, chawanmushi (egg custard), and hot tea.40. The Place for a Surprisingly Affordable, Totally Ambitious Tasting MenuAtoboyMidtown East, ManhattanThe mini tasting menu that chef-owner Junghyun Park serves inside his futuristic-looking Korean restaurant is neither precious nor pretentious, thanks to the warm service and free flow of genre-bending dishes that change with the seasons. Pick three dishes for a set price ($46!) and order strategically with your companions so you get to try as much of the menu as  possible.\u2735 Order: shrimp-stuffed endives, yellowtail crudo, galbi, and fried chicken with peanut sauce.41. The Place for Always-Delicious, Lightning-Fast Caribbean TakeoutThe Food SermonCrown Heights, BrooklynYou had big plans to cook a healthy, hearty Sunday dinner, but wow, it\u2019s already six o\u2019clock. If you\u2019re lucky enough to live in the Food Sermon\u2019s radius, a delicious Caribbean dinner is minutes from your door. We swear, these delivery bikes have jet packs. But if you need to get out of the apartment, there\u2019s no such thing as a bad seat in this tiny spot: The counter running along the windows provides just as good a view for people watching outside as it does for watching cooks assembling the vibrant bowls inside.\u2735 Order: island bowl with braised oxtail, brown rice, chickpeas, and coconut ginger sauce.Please don\u2019t miss the fetti from Tanoreen.\nPhoto by Alex Lau42. The Place for a Group Dinner...and Then Really Good DessertTanoreenBay Ridge, BrooklynSometimes you want it all: copious amounts of appetizers, a sizable entr\u00e9e, and a worth-it dessert. Tanoreen is there for you with tahini-laced vegetables and Middle Eastern meat dishes that are big enough for sharing. But the real star is the knafeh, a cheese-based dessert with thin layers of sweetened noodles. Get the large, even if you\u2019re very full.\u2735 Order: Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, fetti with lamb, baked eggplant, knafeh.43. The Place For Ramen and the Crispiest Chicken WingsTakumenLong Island City, QueensPop through Takumen\u2019s yellow door to grab a matcha latte and a buttery croissant to-go, or grab seats in the wood-clad dining room for chewy ramen noodles in deeply flavorful sauce, hefty rice bowls, and impossibly crispy chicken wings. It\u2019s the perfect place to fuel up before visiting MoMA PS1 or the Noguchi Museum.\u2735 Order: steamed broccoli, any of the ramen soups, roasted peanut and spicy miso sauce chicken wings, soy-garlic chicken wings, and fried squid.44. The Place to Soak Bread in All the Seafood-y Sauces with One Other PersonCervo\u2019sLower East Side, ManhattanWhy is this new-school Portuguese gem from the team behind Hot 10 winner Hart\u2019s and rotisserie hotspot The Fly the perfect hangout for two? Because A) the best seats in this sliver of a space are those at the slim counter that runs the length of the bar and curves around the small open kitchen, and B) you\u2019re going to be protective of every last drop of the garlicky sauces left over from the perfectly cooked seafood.\u2735 Order: olives, prawns, piri-piri chicken, sourdough bread, a bottle of high-acid white wine, and the vermouth service.45. The Place for Korean Barbecue Without the K-Town CrowdsMapo Korean BBQFlushing, QueensYou\u2019ll need to take the Long Island Railroad to get here and probably drag a friend who speaks Korean (or Mandarin\u2014the staff speaks both), but this old-school spot is worth all that planning ahead. It\u2019s one of the few charcoal-powered Korean barbecue restaurants in New York, which gives the galbi the perfect touch of smoke that Midtown\u2019s hot spots just can\u2019t compete with.\u2735 Order: short rib with all the banchan and naengmyun. In the summer, keep an eye out for cold gochujang-marinated crab.46. The Place When You Want to Eat at a Restaurant That\u2019s Actually a Wine BarWildairLower East Side, ManhattanThis small space on Orchard Street is a scene (in a good way). It\u2019s packed with in-the-know diners who are just as interested in Austrian p\u00e9t-nat as they are in fried squid. You\u2019ll go for the wine list and end up ordering the whole menu. Or you\u2019ll go for dinner and become obsessed with the wine list. Either way, go.\u2735 Order: housemade bread with olive oil, beef tartare, potato dauphin, Little Gem lettuce, fried squid, and every dessert.47. The Place for When You Want a Tasting Menu Vibe Minus the Tasting MenuThe Bar at Momofuku KoEast Village, ManhattanYou could go to David Chang\u2019s lauded Momofuku Ko and drop $255 a person (sans booze) on an epic tasting-menu experience\u2026 or you could take a detour and dip into the walk-in-only bar and hit a few (remarkably affordable) highlights. The nose-clearing mustardy pickle sandwich costs $5. The so-weird-it-works cold fried chicken is $6 per piece (but, uh, get more than one piece). And the deliciously rich $45 duck pie can and should be split among a few friends. It\u2019s like a tasting menu on your terms.\u2735 Order: foie gras\u2013topped hamburger, pickle sandwich, sourdough crepes, duck pie, and cold fried chicken.48. The Place for Fried Calamari on the WaterRandazzo\u2019s Clam BarSheepshead Bay, BrooklynThe bright, carnival-esque signage tells you everything you need to know about the folks at Randazzo\u2019s: They\u2019ve been around for a while. Subtlety is not their specialty. And they serve seafood that tastes as classically Italian-American as their name suggests. This is the no-frills Brooklyn-Italian experience you\u2019ve been searching for.\u2735 Order: fried calamari with spicy tomato sauce, linguine with clams, clams casino, penne alla vodka, fried fish sandwich, garlic bread, and some cheap white wine.49. The Place for Soup Dumplings (Even Though It\u2019s Not Known for Soup Dumplings)Deluxe Green BoChinatown, ManhattanReal Green Bo fanatics will remember this restaurant as Nice Green Bo, but while the name has changed the high quality of the food hasn\u2019t. Most venture to the weathered Bayard Street haunt for fried rice or noodles with pork and fermented cabbage (the house specialty), but the soup dumplings are some of the best in the city. Share everything and bring cash.\u2735 Order: hot and spicy wontons, crispy noodles with pork and fermented cabbage, bean sprouts and snow peas, fried pork dumplings, and pork soup dumplings.50. The Place for a Third Date With That Person You Really LikeCaf\u00e9 Altro ParadisoSoho, ManhattanThere might not be a more complete date-night restaurant in New York City. The large, humming room. The breezy, contemporary design. The warm, gentle glow. The well-balanced wine list. The innovative but approachable cocktails. The soulful playlists. The amaro list. The dessert wine. The sorbet. And that\u2019s to say nothing of Ignacio Mattos\u2019 menu of modern, shareable Italian plates, or Natasha Pickowicz\u2019s stunning desserts. Bring someone you want to impress...without seeming like you\u2019re trying to impress them.\u2735 Order: olives, octopus, fennel salad, cacio e pepe, and a side of beans. Finish with a digestivo.51. The Place for Dinner When Fun Is the Top PriorityWin SonEast Williamsburg, BrooklynThe new-school Taiwanese spot is best enjoyed with a group of at least four (or fewer, who really know how to eat). And it\u2019s always more enjoyable if those people aren\u2019t opposed to an impromptu round of shots (which staff may or may not encourage) between excellent fried eggplant and spicy fly\u2019s head (minced pork, fermented beans, chives, and chiles). Win Son is always slammed, so show up early and be ready to hang out by the bar with a drink while you wait.\u2735 Order: roasted peanuts, marinated cucumbers, fried eggplant, fly\u2019s head, sesame noodles, and head-on prawns with minced pork in shrimp broth.The papaya salad from Uncle Boons.\nPhoto by Evan Sung52. The Place That Is Absolutely Worth the Torturous WaitUncle BoonsNolita, ManhattanTwo hours?! Okay, fine. You\u2019ll be glad you waited once you have that first bite of crispy lamb wrapped in lettuce. Uncle Boons is the Thai restaurant that never lets us down\u2014the one that makes everyone happy, out-of-town relatives and fussy coworkers included. Every bite is fire\u2014whether that means it\u2019s spicy or straight awesome. Always over-order.\u2735 Order: yum mamuang (green mango salad), laab neuh gah (crispy lamb salad), kao pat puu (crab fried rice), massaman neuh (short ribs), khalum pli (ingenious rotisserie cabbage), Thai sausage duo, toasted coconut sundae (no matter how full you are).53. The Place Where an Old-School Steakhouse Night Never Gets OldKeens SteakhouseMidtown West, ManhattanNever has a piece of meat received as much attention as the mutton chop from this historic steakhouse (est. 1885!). But there\u2019s more to love about Keens than the fabled two-pound lamb saddle chop (ehem, not actually mutton). There\u2019s the deep list of single-malt Scotches. Waiters dressed in black bow ties and pressed red vests. The expertly stirred martinis. And it\u2019s got one of the largest collections of churchwarden tobacco pipes in the world\u2014which you\u2019ll see hanging from the ceiling, as you lean back and pat your belly.\u2735 Order: wedge salad, shrimp cocktail, mutton chop, porterhouse for two, creamed spinach, hash browns, and a dry martini or three.54. The Place to Go to for Unflinching Indian Food, No Matter Where You Are in Relation to Long Island CityAddaLong Island City, QueensCome to Adda as a group of four. Any fewer and you won\u2019t make a dent in the menu, any more and it might be awhile before one of the tables in the energetic room opens up. Load up on whatever you need (mango lassis? Limca sodas? Chardonnay from the Finger Lakes?) to power through the purposeful heat and powerful spices at the backbone of the menu, from the array of snacks you won\u2019t be able to get enough of at the start of the meal to the slow-cooked goat biryani you\u2019ll take home with you when you finally and unwillingly call it quits.\u2735 Order: tawa kaleji (chicken livers), dilliwala butter chicken, lucknow dum biryani (slow-cooked goat).55. The Place to Eat a Burger, Drink a Beer, and Feel Like One of the RegularsBernie\u2019sGreenpoint, BrooklynOversized mahogany booths. Red-and-white checkered tablecloths. Dim lights. Stained-glass chandeliers. Crispy fries. Frosty mugs of lager. And a staff that knows exactly how to treat you. Bernie\u2019s is the no-fuss, Americana-fueled neighborhood restaurant that\u2019s as perfect for a quick, cold martini as it is for camping out all night with one of New York City\u2019s best burgers. Our official recommendation is to start with the first option, and then stay for the latter.\u2735 Order: Martini, wedge salad, baked clams, mozzarella sticks, double patty burger, and a whole Vinegar Chicken for the table.56. The Place to Go to Eat Pizza and Not Worry About Anything ElseOpsBushwick, BrooklynWhen decision fatigue is the diagnosis, this buzzy Brooklyn pizza place is the cure. The menus are the size of Hallmark cards, featuring a short list of house cocktails, a handful of snacks, exactly one (always perfect) farmers\u2019 market salad that changes daily, and the main event: a selection of perfectly blistered, thoughtfully topped, naturally leavened pizzas. There isn\u2019t even a wine list to worry about. Tell your server what you like, and they\u2019ll bring you tastes from the ever-changing lineup of natural wines\u2014$14 per glass, $50 per bottle, always.\u2735 Order: the salad (large), the Square (tomatoes, house mozzarella, olives, basil, oregano), Juno (broccoli rabe, potatoes, provola, ricotta salata), and Pops (tomatoes, house mozzarella, guanciale, onions, pecorino) pies.57. The Place for the Ultimate Italian-American PilgrimageL&B Spumoni GardensBensonhurst, BrooklynThis spectacular spaghetti palace, open since 1939, is worth the trek to Bensonhurst, especially for big group dinners with zero plans for later\u2014lying flat on your back is the only thing you\u2019ll want to do after eating here. Most pilgrims come for the Sicilian-style pizza (not a bad plan), but if you\u2019re making the trip, go for the four-course family-style Chef\u2019s Table menu. How else will you experience Dueling Shrimp, an oversize platter of shrimp, half fried, half boiled?\u2735 Order: L&B Sicilian pie, mozzarella in carrozza, rice balls, broccoli rabe and sausage pasta, chicken Parmesan.58. The Place Where You Can Get Omakase-Quality Takeout Sushi for Under $20Silver RiceCrown Heights and Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, BrooklynThis raw fish-obsessed city will never be short on incredible $200 omakase tasting menus. But omakase-level takeout sushi for under $20? That only exists at Silver Rice, a bright, tiny sushi and sashimi spot with two locations in Brooklyn. The fresh rolls here are stuffed with pristine fish that\u2019s worlds away from the mystery pink sludge some spots dub \u201cspicy tuna.\u201d But the real move here is the fisherman\u2019s bowl, brimming with chunks of salty snow crab, bright-orange ribbons of salmon, sweet raw scallops, and more over a bed of perfectly seasoned sushi rice.\u2735 Order: fisherman's bowl, shrimp dumpling miso soup (with extra dumplings if you know what\u2019s up), salmon kombu roll, and kimpira salad.59. The Place for a Truly Serious EnchiladaCasa EnriqueLong Island City, QueensTo say that Casa Enrique is a restaurant that serves amazing enchiladas is both telling the truth and selling it short. The saucy, stuffed tortillas are profoundly flavorful and comforting, but so is every other Mexican dish served at this LIC staple. Go for a lazy dinner and do not stop after your second margarita.\u2735 Order: guacamole, rajas con crema, lengua tacos, chicken and salsa verde enchiladas, chile relleno, and countless margaritas.60. The Place for Singing Karaoke After Finishing Your Korean BarbecueInsaGowanus, BrooklynUsually belting out the words to Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cLandslide\u201d inside a restaurant would get you kicked out. But at Insa, it\u2019s quite the opposite. After you finish up an ambitious spread of banchan and a sizable quotient of sizzling pork belly, you and your crew can head to a separate section of the restaurant and start singing (slightly off-key) karaoke in a private room.\u2735 Order: haemul pajeon (seafood pancake), bulgogi, thick-cut pork belly and thinly sliced brisket (for grilling), and dubu kimchi.61. The Place for When You Want New York\u2019s Most Masterful SliceScarr\u2019s PizzaLower East Side, ManhattanThe only thing stronger than the \u201cold-school slice-joint vibe\u201d at Scarr\u2019s is the pizza itself. Flour is milled in-house, and pies are baked to perfection in two small ovens in the front of the shop. Sit in the faux wood\u2013paneled back room\u2014either at the bar with a glass of p\u00e9t-nat, or at one of the four molded plywood booths with a pitcher of Presidente\u2014and dig into a Sicilian slice with pepperoni or a classic slice with mushrooms. Then try convincing  yourself that you\u2019re as cool as the trendy Lower East Side ensembles surrounding you. Do it on a weeknight, though. Fridays and Saturdays are truly swamped.\u2735 Order: any slice or whole pie (especially if you\u2019re at one of the booths in the back with a crew) and a vegan Caesar salad.62. The Place to Be Seen Eating a Large Platter of Nam PrikWaylaLower East SideWe won\u2019t pretend like it\u2019s not going to be crowded. Everyone on the Lower East Side is going to Wayla for big-flavor homestyle Thai food, including us. Think fresh curries with brilliant aromas; whole fried fish seasoned with ginger, dried chiles, and shallots; and fish sauce aplenty. But the one menu item that should land on every table is the nam prik platter, a beautiful spread of vegetables\u2014like Thai eggplant, steamed squash, lettuces, long beans, and okra\u2014served with mushroom, shrimp, and pork dips. Order it for the table. And definitely make a reservation.\u2735 Order: Nam prik, sai oua (fermented pork sausage), moo sarong (meatballs wrapped in crispy noodles), crab-fried rice, whatever whole fish is on the menu, and some ice cold beer.63. The Place for When You Want to Pick Your Own Fish and Tell the Chefs How to Cook ItAstoria SeafoodLong Island City, QueensThere won\u2019t be a moment of serenity during your time at this Greek BYOB. Counter staff shout orders to cooks. Chefs shout at waiters. Guests shout to one another. It\u2019s loud. And it\u2019s fun. Especially because you get to walk alongside the beds of ice and choose whichever fish, bivalves, and shellfish look good, and then tell the staff how to cook them. You hold all the cards, especially since it\u2019s a BYOB.\u2735 Order: Grilled octopus, fried shrimp, grilled fish with lemon and herbs, and a large Greek salad.The full spread at Lois.\nPhoto by Laura Murray, styling by Allie Wist64. The Place for a Casual Date That Still Brings the RomanceLoisAlphabet City, ManhattanThe lights are low, the natural wine is on tap, and the ample cheese plate comes with a schmear of miso-mustard dressing. The music varies, but it\u2019s always a vibe. Ask the approachable bartenders what\u2019s new on the tap list, taste a few wines, and then commit to a carafe and a spot by the windows.\u2735 Order: sausage rolls, olives, seasonal salad, the cheese plate, and a carafe of wine on tap.65. The Place for a Beer After that Broadway Show You Just SawAs IsHell\u2019s Kitchen, ManhattanThe bar scene in Hell\u2019s Kitchen is, well, hellish. But As Is deviates from the neighborhood norm. This beautifully designed bar\u2014with tiled floors, dark woods, and custom light fixtures\u2014rotates more than a dozen of the most exciting taps in the city (highlighting local faves Grimm Artisanal Ales, Other Half Brewing, and Mikkeller NYC, as well as beers from grail-worthy breweries Hill Farmstead and Cantillon), and puts just as much emphasis on fun and accessibility as it does on beer quality. This is the craft beer bar for beer nerds and novices alike.\u2735 Order: something hoppy on tap, a saison from the bottle list, and a plate of nachos.66. The Place to Drink the Stuff You Won't Find at Any Other Bar in NYCHoney\u2019sBushwick, BrooklynThey make mead at the aptly named Honey\u2019s, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to drink the fermented honey water if you go here. This corner bar with a neon-pink sign is run by mad-scientist bartender Arley Marks, who also curates the short list of deep-cut natural wines from all over the world and cocktails like the Hola Yola, made with Yola mezcal, wildflower mead (yup!), byrrh grand quinquina (a French aperitif), and a spritz of absinthe.\u2735 Order: Mead! Do it! It\u2019s great! For real! Or just stick with a glass of white wine.67. The Place for Buying a Fresh IPA Out of a WindowGold Star Beer CounterProspect Heights, BrooklynGold Star Beer Counter is two things: a bar and a bottle shop. But whether you\u2019re drinking a Belgian saison there or taking some hazy cans of IPA to-go, it\u2019s absolutely one of the best places in the five boroughs to get a beer. And yes, you can walk right up to the window from the sidewalk and buy said beer.\u2735 Order: Ask the bartenders which beers are fresh, tasty, and interesting. And get a salami picante sandwich while you\u2019re at it.68. The Place for When Some People Want to Drink and Other People Want to Have a Nice DinnerAchilles HeelGreenpoint, BrooklynFour friends walk into a bar. One wants a glass of easy-drinking red. Another wants a cold can of Genesee. The third could go for a bubbly spritz laced with Averna. And the fourth would rather go straight to pasta with braised pork and white beans. That bar is Achilles Heel\u2014a 100-plus-year-old neighborhood spot on a corner in Greenpoint that has...something for everyone.\u2735 Order: the seasonal spritz, oysters, lentil dip, marinated short rib, and anything that involves She Wolf Bakery bread.69. The Place to Escape the Saturday-Night Chaos of the Lower East Side, While Still Going Out on the Lower East SideBar GotoLower East Side, ManhattanThe confines of this thoughtfully designed jewel box are modeled after Tokyo\u2019s intimate cocktail bars, with a wall of Japanese whiskies and a compact list of craveable bar snacks to soak it all up. The tables are close, providing excellent eavesdropping opportunities. Take full advantage of the cocktail list.\u2735 Order: house pickles, okonomiyaki, miso wings, highballs.70. The Place for a Pitcher of Beer and Curtis Mayfield on the JukeboxJosie\u2019s BarAlphabet City, ManhattanThere\u2019s a bouncer at Josie\u2019s. And probably some NYU students. And maybe a group of washed-up East Village punk rockers. And definitely someone running the pool table. But Josie\u2019s is a dive bar. This is what you signed up for.\u2735 Order: cheap beer and well whiskey.71. The Place for Natural Wine Without the MonologuesThe Ten BellsLower East Side, ManhattanWine bars are frequently plagued by pretentiousness. The Ten Bells is not, and it boasts one of the most well-rounded and exciting lists of by-the-glass natural wine in the city. It\u2019s filled with young, loud, joyous people there to have a good time in the space\u2019s warm orange glow (which makes everything and everyone look more attractive). Show up early and stay late. Spots at the bar\u2014especially on weekends\u2014are coveted.\u2735 Order: Spanish tortilla, mortadella, marinated olives, oysters, and glasses or bottles of whatever you\u2019ve never tried before.72. The Place for a Fancy Martini and the Greatest Bar Mural There Ever WasBemelmans BarUpper East Side, ManhattanA live piano player. Expertly made classic cocktails. Walls painted by Ludwig Bemelmans, the guy who illustrated Madeline. All inside an iconic Art Deco hotel that has discreetly housed the world\u2019s most famous actors, politicians, and musicians. (Jagger! Princess Di! JFK! Anjelica Huston and Jack Nicholson! We\u2019re talking about The Carlyle! Hello!) This is Upper East Side ambiance in its purest form\u2014with prices to match (not to mention the cover charge after 9:30 p.m.).\u2735 Order: a martini, old Scotch, a glass of champagne, or whatever else makes you feel like a millionaire.73. The Place to Travel Back in Time 100 Years and Eat Fries at the BarOld Town BarFlatiron, ManhattanWhether or not you\u2019re using them, it\u2019s important to know that Old Town Bar has the oldest urinals in New York City. Aside from that, the long mahogany bar is well-polished from a century of forearm leans. The booths are cozy enough to keep your secrets. And the dumbwaiters are still bringing fries down from the kitchen upstairs. If it feels familiar, that\u2019s because you\u2019ve seen it before: The bar\u2019s shown up in everything from The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel to House of Pain\u2019s music video for \u201cJump Around.\u201d\u2735 Order: a rye Manhattan, a copy of the New York Post, Buffalo wings, and fries.74. The Place for Rum Punches That\u2019ll Knock You OutLovers RockBed-Stuy, BrooklynThis Bed-Stuy bar wasn\u2019t around in the \u201990s, but you wouldn\u2019t know it from the exposed red light bulbs, palm tree iconography, and thumping Caribbeats. If the need to escape that vibe for a minute overwhelms you, the backyard is big and comfortable.\u2735 Order: Jamaican rums, rum punch, and very cold beer.75. The Place for When You Want a Great Cocktail But Not a \u201cScene\u201dThe Long Island BarCobble Hill, BrooklynThings that make this Cobble Hill bar an excellent place to drink: The classic-leaning cocktails are well-crafted but not precious. (There are no \u201cmixologists\u201d here!) The restored midcentury interior is stylish but not fancy. And the thin-patty burger is exactly what you\u2019ll want to eat with that second cocktail. Oh, and you can usually get a seat no problem.\u2735 Order: a Boulevardier and the Ladies\u2019 Burger.76. The Place for a Glass (or Three) of New School Italian WineKindredEast VillageYou can go to any red sauce joint in New York and get a glass of cheap Chianti. And while you\u2019re Dad might be happy with that, we\u2019re looking for Italian wine with a bit more to say, which is why we hit Kindred for our Italian by-the-glass needs. Think high-acid rosato from Umbria; floral skin contact whites from Puglia; fresh, fruit-forward reds from Abruzzo; and yeah, maybe even some Chianti too. (There\u2019s also a solid number of Eastern European options, from Slovenia and Croatia namely.) The spot, the second from folks at Ruffian nearby, is pretty perfect for a quick, pre-dinner drink at the intimate bar. But if your open to a multi-hour affair, we\u2019d suggest investigating the dinner menu too. You know, for stamina.\u2735 Order: Wines by the glass! Go for something you\u2019re not familiar with or something the staff is especially stoked on.77. The Place for Drinking Sake, Whether You\u2019re a Newbie or Lifelong FanaticSake Bar SatskoAlphabet City, ManhattanSatsko is one of those rare specialty bars that has somehow managed to still feel like a true neighborhood spot. This tiny Alphabet City bar is staffed by bartenders who really want to serve you sake. The list is on the smaller side but filled with everything from clean, dry junmai ginjo to weirder, fruity, unpasteurized varieties. The bartenders\u2014who control the playlists featuring a mix of soul, disco, electronic, chill-wave, and ambient music\u2014also have very good taste in tunes.\u2735 Order: a glass of unpasteurized sake recommended by the bartender and some fried shishito peppers.Just a few of our favorite things to eat at Great N.Y. Noodletown.\nPhoto by Alex Lau78. The Place for When the Bar Just Closed and You\u2019re Craving Char Siu PorkGreat N.Y. NoodletownChinatown, ManhattanIt would take you months to work your way through the entire menu at this Chinatown mainstay. From barbecued meats to crispy noodles, dumpling soup to congee, ginger-soaked greens to bottles of Tsingtao, Great N.Y. Noodletown is a Chinatown MVP for good reason. Show up with a crew, order aggressively (and selectively), and add chile sauce or ginger scallion sauce to everything.\u2735 Order: Barbecued pork, shrimp dumplings, Chinese sausage fried rice, crispy noodles with roast duck, shredded chicken and pea shoots, sea bass with flowering chives, and salt-baked shrimp.79. The Place to Dance with Your Fried Chicken SandwichThe CommodoreWilliamsburg, BrooklynIf you want to eat a phenomenal hot chicken sandwich without listening to a DJ or bumping into someone doing the two-step, go to this tiki-ish Williamsburg bar on the early side. If you\u2019re into a crowded room, occasionally toppled micheladas, and the steady bump of Bronski Beat, go on the later side. Either way you\u2019re going to have a good time.\u2735 Order: A spicy fried chicken sandwich for you, a plate of nachos for the table, and a glass filled with something frozen and boozy.80. The Place for When You\u2019ve Lost Faith in New York\u2019s Taco SceneChilo\u2019sBed-Stuy, BrooklynNo, NYC isn\u2019t known for its Mexican food, and this taco truck perma-parked on a dive bar patio isn\u2019t going to change that. But once you\u2019re a few Tecates and carnitas tacos deep, Chilo\u2019s might make you feel like you\u2019re in Austin or L.A., and sometimes that\u2019s enough.\u2735 Order: Carnitas, cochinita, huitlacoche, and chorizo tacos\u2014and a frozen margarita.81. The Place for Jamaican Food at (Literally) Any TimePeppa\u2019sCrown Heights, BrooklynBars close. Parties end. But Caribbean comfort food at Peppa\u2019s is forever. Saunter up to the window alongside cabbies, night owls, and neighborhood regulars any time from 10 a.m. to 6 a.m (that\u2019s 20 hours of the day), and fill all the braised oxtail\u2013shaped holes in your heart.\u2735 Order: Jerk chicken dinner or the oxtail dinner.82. The Place for When Post-Bar Pierogies Are the Only OptionVeselkaEast Village, ManhattanSkip the dollar slice and head to Veselka, where partiers, elderly insomniacs, and East Village bar-goers unite over pierogies, borscht, and stuffed cabbage. Yes, this 24/7 spot is uniquely suited for soaking up late-night booze, but be respectful: You\u2019re in a New York institution.\u2735 Order: As we said, pierogies, stuffed cabbage (with tomato sauce), and borscht.83. The Place Where Cabbies Go for Late-Night DalPunjabi Deli & GroceryEast Village, ManhattanThis tiny Sikh deli just off Houston Street serves generously seasoned South Asian food 24 hours a day, but after 1 a.m. is when you want to show up and survey the scene. Cab drivers run in and out, some to grab a chai and others just to use the restroom. Drunk college students huddle outside over $5 bowls of rice and curried vegetables. Post-shift service workers carry out bags of samosas to take home. The cheap, comforting cooking\u2014which also happens to be vegan (in case you happen to be the type who cares)\u2014appeals to literally everyone who\u2019s still awake.\u2735 Order: Samosas, pakora, a two-vegetable rice combo, and a ginger-loaded Indian-style chai for the trip home.Just try and resist the pastries at Abra\u00e7o.\nPhoto by Alex Lau84. The Place for When Getting a Coffee Is as Important as Feeling Like an East Village LocalAbra\u00e7oEast Village, ManhattanIn a Venn diagram of caf\u00e9s that excel in house-roasted coffee and ones that excel in house-made baked goods, Abra\u00e7o is the rare occupant of the space where both circles overlap. Visitors can expect an always-full pastry case, the steady drip of deeply flavorful espresso coming from the La Marzocco, jazz reverberating from the turntable, and a patio filled with proud regulars. There isn\u2019t a cafe more well-rounded, consistent, and downright cool in the five boroughs.
