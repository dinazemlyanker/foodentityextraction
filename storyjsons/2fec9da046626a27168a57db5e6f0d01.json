For those of you taking the \"Cobb Salad\" part literally: you missed the word TROPICAL & you didn't look at the photo!  The only comparison meant by this was that it is laid out like a Cobb Salad ... Just breathe Peep's lolLov2LivWest Coast6/27/2021Love this--it's fresh, tangy, and simple, even if it requires some chopping. Anonymous950373/19/2021When leaving a review, it automatically selected five stars and I couldn't change it. \nI would rate it 3,5 stars instead...\nIt was just OK. The combination of the creamy mango and red onion was excellent. However, I felt like there was something missing in the end.Wammie22113/4/2021So easy to throw together pretty quickly for a weeknight. The spice of the chicken and red onion combined with the creamy sweetness of the mango, and freshness of the herbs and greens is SO good. Def not a Cobb salad, by any means, but delicious in its own right. AnonymousLos Angeles10/12/2020Love this recipe! I make it with cauliflower (the way the chicken is prepared) and it is so good! Everyone should try this outAnonymousBloomington, Indiana11/27/2018Great for a quick lunch, I didn't know mango went so well with red onion! thank you so muchMonCoastColombia8/28/2018There is nothing \"Cobb\" about this salad. It's mediocre tropical salad, at best! The description really sold it for me, and I was very underwhelmed (even taking away the comparison to Cobb salad)!
