Follow her progress on Instagram @PKgourmet.We all have our party tricks. Mine is pav bhaji.These buttered buns topped with a spiced vegetable gravy, finely chopped red onions, and lime juice (think of it as a vegetarian sloppy joe) are that golden goose of an entertaining dish: It looks very impressive but takes little time to cook. It stands in for a complete meal, and it\u2019s only one recipe. It satisfies a bunch of dietary restrictions. And, it can be mostly made ahead, while allowing for some guest participation (there\u2019s nothing wrong with getting them to put in some work too). I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve totally forgotten that I\u2019d invited people over, whipped up pav bhaji (and only pav bhaji), and then been complimented as if I spent the whole day hovered over my stove.Though there are a lot of different versions of the dish out there\u2014ones that use different spices and vegetables, and lots of butter (nothing wrong with that, obviously)\u2014it is my aunt Sonia\u2019s recipe, chock full of chunky veggies and spices you can really taste, that is the most deeply comforting to me. During my childhood, whenever my family would head to a dinner party at Sonia\u2019s house, I\u2019d secretly hope she was making her famous pav bhaji. She didn\u2019t make it very often, so I\u2019d always assumed it was something deeply time consuming and difficult\u2014a special-occasion-only deal.So, when I asked Sonia for the recipe for my cookbook years later, I was surprised to find out that the whole thing came down to boiling a bunch of vegetables. Specifically: a handful of frozen peas and cauliflower florets, plus two Russet potatoes. Then you drain \u2019em. Peel and mash the potatoes (don\u2019t sweat too much about lumps). Then, in a big pan over medium-high heat, add a tablespoon of olive oil, followed by \u00be teaspoon of ground turmeric, and a tablespoon of ground coriander. Throw in two chopped fresh Roma tomatoes, and stir until it becomes a chunky tomato sauce. Next, reduce the heat to medium-low, add your peas, cauliflower, potatoes, and a chopped green chile. Let that stew together for a few minutes. That\u2019s your \u201cbhaji.\u201dNow, the \u201cpav\u201d part. Split eight buns of your choice in half. I like to use squishy, airy potato rolls, which are the best texture and resemble the traditional yeasted bun \u2014plush, yet sturdy enough to hold up to all that gravy goodness. Butter each side. Toast \u2019em in a pan until golden brown. Have your guests\u2014this will feed about four of them\u2014assemble it all like open-faced sandwiches, with a spoonful of bhaji, plus finely chopped red onions and a squeeze of lime. Eat. Bask in all the flattery.After all these years, I now know that one my most nostalgia-inducing comforts was probably just Sonia\u2019s party trick. It was likely the meal she\u2019d make when she wanted to spend her evenings doing anything other than cooking\u2014including liquoring up her guests and making fun of her husband, Sharad, whose jokes revolve entirely around puns.Pav bhaji was her little secret. And now, it\u2019s mine!You can pre-order Priya\u2019s upcoming cookbook Indian-ish on Amazon for $23. Woo hoo!Explore Bon App\u00e9titIndianishVegetarianSandwichRecipes you want to make.
