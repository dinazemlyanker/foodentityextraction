Maybe I\u2019m a snob, but I can\u2019t help it. Often times, the fatty, Creamsicle-hued slab is just there to appeal to the least adventurous eaters. It tends to be handled in the most mundane way possible\u2014maybe served as a skinny filet, seared in a pan, and flecked with black garlic or pickled beets. See? Boring.But when I stumbled upon Alison Roman\u2019s roasted salmon recipe a couple months ago, a new phrase surfaced in my brain: I must eat this. And that\u2019s what I did. Again. And again. It was love at first click.It\u2019s almost stupidly simple to make. You start by thinly slicing a jewel box of aromatics\u2014anise-y fennel, tangy-sweet blood orange and Meyer lemon, spicy-fruity Fresno chile\u2014and toss them in a baking dish with sprigs of dill and a bit of kosher salt. Then, you lay the salmon on top of that beautiful bed of pretty things, sprinkle on a bit more salt, and shower it all with nearly a cup of olive oil.You can also use the same slow-roasting technique with this harissa salmon recipe.\nPhoto by Stephen Kent Johnson, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiThat\u2019s the secret to what makes this salmon so special: You're practically poaching the salmon in all that olive oil, making it impossible to overcook (more or less). And even if you\u2019re constantly poking the fish to be sure you don\u2019t go over that perfect coral-hued medium-rare (at 275\u00b0, that's like 30-40 minutes in the oven), it won\u2019t mess up the presentation. Once the salmon is done, you break it up into hunks on whatever pretty platter you have, then scatter the plate with your perfectly roasted aromatics, replacing the wilty dill with lots of the fresh stuff. The result is the equivalent of a perfect hair day: You roll out of bed, do absolutely nothing, and somehow get tons of compliments.Simply put, this is the recipe that has restored my faith in the maligned protein. And while I\u2019m content to eat it myself (it works without the chiles, and with a splash of soy sauce too), I\u2019ve also tested it on friends. This table full of near strangers immediately bonded over one show-stopping dish. The salmon is that powerful. It can bring people together, and convert even the most stubborn salmon hater into a salmon lover.Get the recipe:Slow-Roasted Salmon with Fennel, Citrus, and ChilesDon\u2019t bother trying to divide this fillet into tidy portions. Instead, use a spoon to break it into perfectly imperfect pieces.View RecipeRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
