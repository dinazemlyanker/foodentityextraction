And do they belong on your Thanksgiving table?By Alex BeggsNovember 10, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailEvery Friday morning, Bon App\u00e9tit senior staff writer Alex Beggs shares weekly highlights from the BA offices, from awesome new recipes to office drama to restaurant recs, with some weird (food!) stuff she saw on the internet thrown in. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Deep in the heart of quesoLaura MurrayBefore I could even order my first don\u2019keyrita, my dad requested a large bowl of queso. Even the tightest trip home leaves room for queso, and we always go to Don\u2019Key, a Tex-Mex spot off the highway in Pasadena, Texas, that never misses an opportunity to make \u201cass\u201d jokes. I like that kind of commitment to comedy, and butts.The bowl of smooth, canary yellow milkified cheese comes with a lone jalape\u00f1o sunk to the bottom, my prize for getting there. When I\u2019m homesick, I make Rick Martinez\u2019s showstopping recipe for Bob Armstrong dip, pictured up top, which combines taco meat into the perfect blend of chiles and cheeses. It\u2019s ridiculously good, even if you just want the cheese part, and it\u2019s much better than the way I\u2019d make it as a kid, microwaving slices of Velveeta with milk and stirring it with a Tostito shard.Why don\u2019t we make this at Thanksgiving???

Inside, we wandered from booth to booth, sampling a range of funky natural wines, some that tasted like thick water, one with notes of human stomach acid (the aftertaste of vomiting), and one that tasted like a fuzzy navel wine cooler, but fancy. What a crowd, too! One baby-faced gentlemen poured us a nice Chilean wine that filled my nostrils with the fumes of rosemary while he flipped through a binder of photos of wild-growing grapes, bored from having to show this to hundreds of people all weekend. We cooed over the pretty grapes, and what\u2019s that? Rosehips. Huh. Over my outreached arm, a woman squirted some discarded wine through her teeth into a bucket, like a cowboy aiming for a spittoon. She nailed it.Water picklesAfter we accidentally drank too much wine because spitting felt wrong, we went to Mission Chinese Food and had the water pickles, a dish that went micro-viral last week for being an $8 bowl of ice. (The internet!) The pickles were actually great? These pickled pieces of cabbage and radish were freezing flavor bombs, and kind of hammy. \u201cThis daikon tastes like meat,\u201d we concluded, and we were happy.Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Food Styling by Kat BoytsovaSunday not-so-scariesHave you seen Healthyish\u2019s Guide to Sunday? And not just my round-up of comfy lounge clothes, based on my dreams of becoming Auntie Mame. This almond quick bread is so good with coffee\u2014and I watched Sarah Jampel make SIX loaves one afternoon to get the ratio right for the winning balance of moist, dense, and cakey. I love Sunday! Whispers, It\u2019s my favorite day to work.Get the recipe: Almond Butter and Jam Quick BreadHow was your week?Unnecessary food feud of the weekThere are centerpieces\u2014and then there are Sandra Lee tablescapes. Is there even room for turkey on a table full of frosted faux pumpkins?? It turns out the BA staff has a few different camps of thought: the foragers, the floral arrangers, and Brad. Molly Baz asked: \u201cWhat even is  a cornucopia? I\u2019m not convinced.\u201dEmma Wartzman, Amanda Shapiro, Aliza Abarbanel, and Anna Stockwell are foragers, gathering leaves, sticks, acorns, pine cones, and berry branches for their rustic tableaux. This news horrified Amiel: \u201cYou can\u2019t take stuff from the OUTSIDE and put it on your TABLE, there are BUGS!\u201d Emma replied: \u201cShake them! Blow on them!\u201d Anna\u2019s mom has a collection of animal toys she displays throughout the gathered leaves, while Zoe Sessums family has a beach theme, a collection of stones and shells that have conglomerated with candle wax throughout the years.The sophisticated flower people include Meryl Rothstein, Hilary Cadigan, Adam Rapoport, and Julia Kramer, who once had an arrangement by Saipua that was so elaborate (and stunning!)\u2014including artfully off-kilter persimmons\u2014she had to set up a side buffet for food. Hilary\u2019s mom is the president of her garden club, so. And Rapo is fine with a snaking linear arrangement of flowers and branches and whatnot, because he\u2019s endorsing a buffet-style Thanksgiving this year: \u201cAs long as there are gravy boats on BOTH ends of the table.\u201dThen there\u2019s Brad. \u201cCenterpieces? I can get into that.\u201d He shouted at me even though I was 18 inches away from him. \u201cOak leaves! Acorns! Winter squash! Cranberries fresh from the bog! Some dead wild bird, pheasants, spread across the table!\u201d Wait-wha? \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about building miniature tables to put on top of the table so you can put your centerpiece on that, so there\u2019s still room for all the food.\u201d Take that, Pinterest.Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterThanksgivingRecipes you want to make.
