If it\u2019s your first time making crepes, know that it will take a few tries to master swirling the pan just so to attain a thin, even layer of crepe\u00a0batter. Using a short-sided crepe pan can make maneuvering easier, but you can make delicious homemade\u00a0crepes using a traditional nonstick pan too. Once you get the hang of it, things move quickly, so prepare your accompaniments like chopped fresh fruit or orange juice-based Suzette and milk chocolate sauces in advance.If you prefer savory crepes, try stuffing them with ham and cheese or smoked salmon and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. For a heartier style of crepe, these buckwheat ones with creamy leeks and baked eggs work well for a light supper or as an all-in-one brunch dish.Editor\u2019s note: This recipe was originally published in our December 2016 issue and first appeared online November 15, 2016.IngredientsMakes about 204large eggs, room temperature2\u2153cups whole milk\u2154cup sugar1teaspoon vanilla extract2\u2153cups all-purpose flour\u00bdteaspoon kosher salt4tablespoons unsalted butter, meltedSuzette Sauce and Milk Chocolate Sauce, whipped cream, powdered sugar, and/or jam (for serving)PreparationStep 1Blend eggs, milk, sugar, and vanilla in a blender until smooth and frothy.

They're fantastic. I blended my batter to obtain a smoother consistency, which was a fantastic idea. They were neither too salty nor too sweet; they were exactly right.Julia FoxMiami1/30/2022This is an easy recipe that turns out tasty, credible cr\u00eapes. I also use a recipe from my friend's family's cave in M\u00e9doc: 1 bottle beer + 1 stick butter, melted + 6 eggs, blended + pinch of salt + 2 1/2 c + flour, depending on the humidity; mix all the ingredients together; cover and leave on the counter overnight; cook as described in your recipe's directions. I use my fingers to flip them and separate each with a paper towel that can be used for other things afterwards; some people are very talented & use the pan to flip each cake up in the air and catch it in the pan. Very impressive!AnonymousGolden, CO1/25/2022Who needs 20 crepes? How about changing the recipe for maybe 4, 6, or 8.NealAsheville, NC1/25/2022Parfait! I lived in France and these are just like the crepes from Normandy.Amy FrenchRockingham, NC5/7/2021Very forgiving recipe - I used oat milk because I didn't have any milk and I also didn't have vanilla. I also used cold eggs and only chilled the batter for like 10 minutes lol. They turned out perfect! Lots of butter in the pan is essential :) AnonymousToronto, ON5/30/2020great recipe, but it really could be useful to add a measurement in grams at the ricepe \ud83d\ude05 plurralEurope 4/11/2020Great recipe! I add in some chia seeds, oregano and garlic, perfect for savory moments. Good with ground meat and veggies!AnonymousSingapore4/10/2020I've never made crepes before and these are delicious and much easier than I expected. Using a blender to mix everything and then pour is really nice. I only had whole wheat flour so it was harder to tell when they were done and ready to flip because it was a darker batter, but still were delicious!morgansainDenton, TX4/4/2020Excellent! I found keeping the pan a little lower on heat worked best for my stovetop/cookware.AnonymousHalifax, NS12/29/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titCrepePancakeFrenchEuropeanEasyVegetarianNut-FreeFryBreakfastRecipes you want to make.
