Just a lot of ups and downs\u2014and you don\u2019t know how steep the downs are until you\u2019re on it.The first couple weeks of last March were pretty scary and unreal. No one knew what the hell was going on. But being a Chinese restaurant in a Chinese community, we saw the writing on the wall. A lot of my staff have family in Asia, and they heard how bad COVID-19 was out there, specifically in China. That kind of news was detrimental to the neighborhood. Business was down and so was morale prior to the March 16 shutdown in NYC. My staff is on these chatroom platforms like Weibo and WeChat, and they were talking shit to each other. \u201cOh, your family went to China and brought it.\u201d Or there were rumors, generally in the Chinese community on these chatroom platforms, that coronavirus started upstairs, above Nom Wah. It was Chinese being mean to other Chinese. I started seeing this more and more because everyone was reacting from their screens.Things escalated pretty quickly. When the shutdown was announced, we decided to close the restaurant since a lot of our staff live in multigenerational households and were afraid of contracting the virus and spreading it to their families. We gave away food to our staff and went into hibernation for two months. People managed to get whatever government assistance was out there\u2014unemployment, stimulus checks. I made sure of that. But I also knew that my staff, and the Asian community overall, is very strong and know how to live within their means.Exactly two months after we closed, we reopened the tea parlor because our PPP had just kicked in. Applying for that loan was like a sneaker drop. You\u2019re on your computer, and you go to a certain portal to enter all your info and upload your tax filings to get your loan amount. But then after doing all that, it was like, \u201cOh my god, it\u2019s not going through or the website is buffering.\u201d In the end we got a loan for the restaurant, along with loans for our other locations in Nolita (which stayed open throughout the pandemic) and Philly.At the tea parlor, we started bringing people back slowly. We just rotated staff so everyone could come in, earn some money, and have some normalcy. We also arranged for carpooling and paid for parking so everyone could come safely in their own pod.Summer was okay. I applied for NYC\u2019s Open Streets program to close Doyers Street, so we were able to put out tables and chairs. The outdoor dining brought back a little business, but the numbers weren\u2019t great. Sales were down 80 percent, so we had to figure out ways to get creative.My whole thing was how do we bring business to a restaurant outside the four walls? I started cold-calling apartment buildings in the area, asking them if they\u2019d be interested doing a group buy of individual take-out orders. The idea was to do 40\u201350 orders for one night for one building, so they save on delivery fees. We also offered cooking demos for buildings, so tenants could buy dumpling-making kits and hop on Zoom with us to learn how to make dumplings. We pitched these things to building managers so they could offer them as amenities to tenants since they couldn\u2019t use gyms and common spaces. We did more than a dozen of these think-outside-the-box ideas.We also began selling our frozen dumplings nationwide through a partnership with Goldbelly. It started out pretty easy, just 20 orders a week. We were so conservative in terms of what we thought we\u2019d sell. Throughout the entire winter, from Thanksgiving to Christmas to Lunar New Year to Valentine\u2019s Day, it was gangbusters. We were packing hundreds of orders a day. My business partner at the Nolita location and I banged out these orders everyday.This didn\u2019t make up for the 80 percent. We ate into our savings. We cut deals with our landlords. We reduced the staff. I took a massive pay cut. All those things combined got us through the season.This year, there wasn\u2019t much of a celebration for Lunar New Year. I don\u2019t think it was warranted, with COVID. There wasn\u2019t a parade. There wasn\u2019t anything. We did what we could as a small restaurant group. We made the auspicious foods. We had one lion dance group come to ward off the evil spirits and bring the restaurant good luck. But the streets were pretty quiet. Restaurants have been closing early because the staff needs to get home. After the rise in hate crimes against the AAPI (Asian American Pacific Islander) community the past couple months, no one wants to stay out past 6 p.m. A few weeks ago, someone got stabbed down the block from us. Businesses in Chinatown were already hurting, and now everyone is afraid for their lives.The stakeholders of this community are chipping in to see what they can do. Jennifer Tam and Victoria Lee, the founders of Welcome to Chinatown, have been doing a phenomenal job advocating for small businesses here. There\u2019s this guy, Karlin Chan\u2014he\u2019s a lifetime resident of Chinatown and he\u2019s always organizing Chinatown Block Watches to patrol the streets like the Guardian Angels. Patrick Mock of 46 Mott is awesome. Jenny Low is an activist who has been talking to the media about ways to help. They\u2019ve all done so much for the community.I\u2019ll be the first one to tell you: I don\u2019t know how to make an impact yet. I\u2019m still sorting it out in my head. And I\u2019m listening.At the restaurant, I end up being a therapist, dealing with everyone\u2019s issues at home or in the workplace. That\u2019s how I hear about the kind of racism my staff is facing. Someone will tell me, \u201cOh, this person got spat on.\u201d Another will share, \u201cSo and so got pushed on the train.\u201d These are the stories I hear, but when I sit down with those who experienced this, they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s fine.\u201d I think Chinese Americans, and Asian Americans in general, are humble. They suck it up and deal with it. But I want to make sure my staff has someone to come to, either myself or my management team, to talk about these things.Since it\u2019s been such a roller coaster, we started getting excited over the smallest things. Like a few weeks ago, we could officially open for 35 percent dine-in capacity. We were like, \u201cOh my god, we can fit seven more people in the dining room!\u201d About 75 percent of my staff has the vaccine. We take those small wins.This year has felt so long, so much longer than 12 months. It\u2019s definitely been the longest year of my life. The pandemic brought me back to day one of running a restaurant, hustling dumplings and connecting with the community.As I\u2019ve been packing these Goldbelly orders, I read the messages people send with them. They range from, \u201cSorry we couldn\u2019t get together this year, but hopefully we can pig out in Chinatown soon\u201d to \u201cHey, Mom and Dad, here are some dumplings,\u201d or even \u201cHappy birthday! We couldn\u2019t celebrate, but remember that great meal we had at Nom Wah?\u201d These are the messages we got from Maine to Florida to Alaska to Hawaii. It was so heartwarming. It reminds me that people care about Chinatown. It pushes me to do more.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCoronavirusFirst PersonRead Moreculture\u201cIf I Can Eat in Chinatown, So Can You\u201dBy Wilson Tang, as told to Elyse InamineRecipes you want to make.
