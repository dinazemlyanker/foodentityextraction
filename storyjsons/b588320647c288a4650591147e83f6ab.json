Just like how nearly every American household has a microwave, nearly every home kitchen in Taiwan has a Tatung steamer. We use it daily to cook rice, steam buns, and even reheat leftovers. It\u2019s considered the most basic piece of cooking equipment\u2014the appliance everyone needs to own in order to survive college. Until I moved to the U.S., I didn\u2019t think I could live without one in my kitchen.Tatung Electric Steamer$143 $120 at Amazon$140 $98 at Wayfair$137 at TS EmporiumBut as I became more familiar with cooking on a gas stove, I learned to steam dishes using a wok setup, which allows me to steam bigger items and control the heat better than I could in my Tatung (it\u2019s an amazing appliance for anyone who wants consistently perfect rice, but it\u2019s limited to what can fit inside it). Once you learn how to rig a steamer with a few pieces of common kitchen equipment, on the other hand, there\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t steam\u2014from fresh crabs to silky steamed eggs to whole fish\u2014and you don\u2019t need a special machine to do it.Here are a few tips I learned from Taiwanese home kitchens for building and using a simple setup so you can steam pretty much anything you want without relying on steaming baskets or an electronic steamer.Here\u2019s how to steam:To make a simple DIY steamer, you need only three items (and you might already have them in your kitchen). The first is a deep vessel to cook in, be it a wok, pot, or deep pan. The size of the vessel depends on the size of the food and/or the cooking container. If you\u2019re steaming in a bowl or on top of a plate, that bowl or plate needs to fit completely inside the vessel.The next thing is a lid to trap the steam. When covered, the lid should not be touching the food. (Imagine your dumpling\u2019s skin sticking on the lid, breaking and losing all the juice\u2014you don\u2019t want that.) It\u2019s helpful to have a dome lid, which provides more overhead room for steam to collect and prevents your food from getting smashed.Heavy Duty Dome Lid$20 at AmazonFinally, you need something to keep the food from touching the water\u2014otherwise you\u2019ll just be boiling. You can use any heatproof item, like an inverted wide bowl that can act as a stand in the boiling water\u2014even three aluminum foil balls would work in a pinch. But my preference is a round cooking rack. Found in most Asian grocery stores and also available online, they\u2019re reusable, sturdy, and just the right size, height, and shape for the job.Round Cooling Rack, Set of 3$14 at AmazonTo steam, place the rack in the center of the pot. Add about an inch of water\u2014it shouldn\u2019t be touching the highest part of the rack. Cover the pot and turn the heat to medium. When you hear the water boiling or see steam coming out, you\u2019re ready to start. Add your food, re-cover the pot, and let it cook according to the recipe (or your liking).A tip for removing handling hot dishes (and avoiding painful steam burns): Use a hot dish clip. Yes, dry towels or mitts are chefs\u2019 best friends in the kitchen when handling burning hot pans. But it\u2019s much easier to use the clip to retrieve the dish, especially when towels tend to get wet from steam or boiling water. From Taipei to New York, I always keep a hot dish clip in my kitchen.Stainless Steel Gripper and Clamp$19 at AmazonAs soon as you\u2019ve mastered this basic setup, you can steam almost anything you want at home with what you already have available in the kitchen. All that\u2019s left to do is decide what to steam first. I think these jiggly, custardy steamed eggs are a great place to start.Get steamySilky Steamed Eggs With MushroomsThese savory and oh-so-simple steamed eggs are the definition of cozy comfort food.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingtechniqueShoppingRecipes you want to make.
