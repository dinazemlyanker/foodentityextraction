Mine\u2019s Winesap.\u201d This was neither funny nor interesting. I put down my gigantic thermos of \u201cMother\u2019s Little Helper,\u201d a potent caffeine-free herbal tea by David\u2019s Tea. But Mother wasn\u2019t helping; she had me fucked-up on valerian.That was the last time I tested a sleepy-time tea at 3 p.m. on a Tuesday. On the one hand, an afternoon session seemed like the only way to determine the efficacy of the best teas for sleep. On the other, I was dozing off at work.The original Sleepytime Tea (you know the one, with the comatose bear in front of a precarious roaring fire), hit shelves in 1972. That thing sells over 4 million boxes a year\u2014the people need their sleep. With herbal remedies (cough) becoming more and more mainstream, there are dozens of teas for sleep to choose from. And just wait until you hear about Ambien!Herbalists will note that different human bodies react differently to herbs: Some might feel energized by valerian tea, while others might conk out after a watery cup of chamomile. I kept that in mind\u2014and so should you because this isn\u2019t medical advice, dudes\u2014as I sipped and snoozed my way through all the best teas for sleep. Some taste like gym socks, others like floral arrangements in a funeral parlor, and a few manage to have no flavor whatsoever.In this very unscientific test, I yawned my way through the workday to find the sleepiest and most delicious bedtime tea on the market, though, to be honest, some of those meetings were just very boring.Here we go.Pukka Night TimeI\u2019m a fan of all Pukka teas, mostly because the name reminds me of the giant rabbit from Harvey, but also because they\u2019re never bitter in the way bagged tea sometimes can be. They\u2019re organic, too, which is a bonus because I like my herbs squeaky clean. The trick to getting the most flavor out of Pukka\u2019s Night Time tea is to steep it for a longer period of time\u2014up to 15 minutes\u2014so that more of the licorice flavor comes out (in a lightly spiced way, not like the disgusting candy). Otherwise, the flavor is so low-key you can barely taste anything. The main ingredient is oat flower, which is relaxing and subtle. There\u2019s also a hint of chamomile, but just barely. Tulsi, lavender, and limeflower are other players, but they\u2019re all nearly invisible, like a mischievous rabbit who follows Jimmy Stewart around.Verdict: Easy to drink and perfect after a meal, when maybe you don\u2019t want intense flavors chiming in. Combined with Seinfeld reruns and a few glasses of wine, I was asleep in three minutes flat. I will be drinking this again the next time I need a restful sleep.Pukka Night Time Herbal Tea$18 at Amazon (3 boxes)$5 at iHerb (1 box)Traditional Medicinals Nighty Night ValerianIf you\u2019re really serious about getting a better sleep fast, you need to skip over the plain Nighty Night and hit the Nighty Night Valerian instead. It gets me every time. After a 10-minute steep, there\u2019s a pleasant funky-earthy smell to this organic tea, with subtle notes of gym socks. But the scent is much stronger than the taste. This is a tea made from passionflower\u2014an actual flower known to chill the nerves, not the name of a bath oil your mom bought from the last Avon lady on Earth. If you\u2019re the kind of person who lies in bed thinking about those lost USPS packages, your cat\u2019s fading eyesight, and what will happen to your health care in the near future, well, this is for you.Verdict: Legit. Despite the scent, the flavor is mellow and perfect if you need to unwind at the end of a long day overthinking how to respond to that one email. I would recommend it.Traditional Medicinals Nighty Night Valerian Tea$5 at Target$5 at AmazonDavid\u2019s Tea\u2019s Mother\u2019s Little HelperThis loose leaf tea has an intense minty, citrusy, and medicinal flavor, which honestly just comes with the sleepy time territory. The valerian root is in full effect. As mentioned earlier, it fucked me up in the office, so I save this one for seriously stressful nights, like, say, when you know you need to write a long story about tea the next morning and have really procrastinated. The scent is pleasant but also very strong, so I store this tea away from other teas lest they all start smelling like lemongrass.Verdict: Seriously snoozy and will get you ready for a good night\u2019s sleep\u2014but not subtle in flavor. Doctor it up with honey to cut through the bitterness.David\u2019s Tea Mother\u2019s Little Helper$10 at Sips by$10 at David's TeaSteep Echo ReposeSteep Echos\u2019 teas are made from olive leaves (cool!) and have obtuse one-word names like Hush and Ascent. The packaging is nicer than any wallpaper I\u2019ve ever owned, and I\u2019ve owned some nice wallpaper. The flavor is just lovely (chamomile flowers, lots of rose), matching the fancy-boutique-hotel-on-the-seaside vibes of said paper. Need I say more? The longer the steep, the more potent it becomes, so I\u2019d recommend taking the tea bag out after 3\u20134 minutes.Verdict: This tea had a calming effect, but was not a get-thee-to-dreamtown sleep aid. I\u2019d recommend it for late-afternoon stress, after your boss pulled you into his office to reprimand you for something that definitely wasn\u2019t your fault. Or was it?Steep Echo Repose Tea$15 at Sips byGaia Herbs Sleep & RelaxThere\u2019s a big warning in bold on this box: KEEP AWAY FROM CHILDREN. So you know it\u2019s gonna be good. Sorry kids, stick to your sippy cups of scotch, this is adult tea that\u2019s far from a placebo. Passionflower is really carrying the team, with lemon balm, licorice, and chamomile on the bench. With all those assertive ingredients, you would think that this tea for sleep would taste like...something. Anything. How can a tea taste like so much nothing? These are the stoner thoughts you\u2019ll have when drinking this tea. If I had to say it tastes like something, I\u2019d go with hay or the color beige. Unoffensive. I didn\u2019t feel woozy or slightly dangerous the way I do sometimes with valerian teas. It\u2019s good to switch things up before your body starts building up tolerances.Verdict: Very chill, but not chill enough. Is this the best tea for sleep? I don\u2019t know, but it packs a good sleepy punch and the flavor of nothing continues to mystify me.Gaia Herbs Sleep and Relax Herbal Tea$5 at Pharmaca$6 at GaiaCelestial Seasoning\u2019s Sleepytime ExtraIf your mom microwaved Sleepytime for you when you were young and she needed you to go to bed already for the love of god, you\u2019ll recognize the huge, snoring bear on the box from a mile away. Celestial Seasonings tried to rebrand, and thousands of calls and emails cried out \u201cUM, NO.\u201d So they brought the bear back, and the world is a better place for it. The herbs aren\u2019t organic, so the yogi-wellness gurus I consulted don\u2019t adore this one, but I do\u2014and I think you will too. They\u2019ve managed to cook up a flavorful herbal blend that\u2019s slightly sweet, minty, and chamomile-forward without any bitterness. Plus, it\u2019s heavy on the most powerful ingredient of all: nostalgia. Well, nostalgia and valerian, which is what makes this Sleepytime EXTRA.Verdict: You can consider this one the Coca-Cola of sleepy teas. The flavor is comforting, powerful, and downright good. It\u2019s a solid choice that checks all of the boxes and can be found at pretty much any grocery store\u2014BOOM.Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime Extra$5 at iHerb$4 at TargetRebecca\u2019s Herbal Apothecary Bedtime BlendThis was my first time as a human ever to consume catnip, which I knew had great reviews from my cat, Roger, but apparently is also a muscle-relaxing nerve-chiller. It\u2019s a lemon balm tea with oatstraw, lavender, and skullcap, which came highly recommended from a flower-essence therapist friend of mine. True story, and real career. When steeped, this made a darker, gray tea that smelled like oatmeal and tasted very mellow, with hints of...hay? That was the most concrete thing I could put my finger on.Verdict: If you\u2019re not a fan of chamomile/licorice/all those usual medicine flavors in most sleep-aid bevs, this is your cup of tea. As I drank it, I felt like I wanted something more, but maybe I\u2019m just not appreciative of nuance. Snooze factor: It won\u2019t knock you out right away, but it will give you a calm, relaxed energy. You could easily drink it during the day after a rough meeting or before that flower-essence therapist appointment.Rebecca\u2019s Herbal Apothecary\u2019s Bedtime Blend$26 at Rebecca'sHomestead Apothecary Dream TimePackaged in an open-shelf-friendly octagonal jar, there was a big, green dried hop (the stuff you make beer with) on the top of the tea when I twisted off the lid. What a nice touch! This is a very unique tea, with mugwort and hops, and I love anything that gives me Macbeth witch vibes. I used to make potions like this when we camped in the Michigan woods in my childhood, and this was the tea I was trying to make. Lots of dried pieces of actual nature, without the flavor of sticks, mud, and Off! Bug spray. After steeping the suggested 10\u201330 minutes, the tea still had only a hint of rose-chamomile flavor. To bring out the floral notes, cold-steep the tea before you leave for work in the morning and then strain it to reheat before bed. You can drink it more concentrated this way, which means less liquid before going to bed\u2014if you\u2019re working hard to go to sleep, you might as well try to stay asleep. A note that this tea used to be called Sweet Dreams, but now goes by Dream Time. Same witchy stuff.Verdict: Pleasant, neutral flavor. After having a cup at 3 p.m. on a Monday, I felt a little dizzy\u2014this is definitely better for nighttime. Did it give me \u201cepic dreamtime adventures,\u201d as Homestead\u2019s website promises? Not really. As someone who sometimes would rather not remember her dreams, that\u2019s fine with me.Homestead Apothecary Dream Time Blend$11 at Homestead ApothecaryThis article was originally published in 2017.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishShoppingRead Morecooking5 Healthyish Ingredients We're Sprinkling On EverythingGallery5 SlidesBy Nikita Richardson Recipes you want to make.
