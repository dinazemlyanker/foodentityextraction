The Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) brought in chef Jason Hammel\u2014of Chicago\u2019s beloved farm-to-table trailblazer Lula Cafe\u2014to run its ambitious coffee bar-slash-takeaway-slash-brunch/lunch/dinner restaurant. Expect a thoughtfully sourced menu of very beautiful food from chef de cuisine Sarah Rinkavage, set against the backdrop of a wall mural from the legendary artist Chris Ofili.ORDER THE: epic veggie cheeseburger at lunch\u2014it will change your entire outlook on veggie burgers. Hyper-seasonal salads (like roasted beets with strawberries and radicchio) and handmade pastas (like bucatini with salmon roe or rigatoni with baby squid) star at dinner.THE VIBE IS: definitely still a basement museum restaurant, albeit a very well-designed one. This is the ideal place to come when you need a break from museum-hopping or shopping on Michigan Avenue.IN CASE OF (VERY RARE) NICE WEATHER: Grab a grilled ham-and-Comt\u00e9 sandwich and coffee from to-go bar and head to a nearby park (or to the beach!).GETTING IN: shouldn\u2019t be too hard; this place is built to accommodate the museum-going throngs and takes reservations. Note that both the MCA and Marisol are closed on Mondays.\u2014Julia KramerJeff MariniCallie LipkinJeff MariniWE ALSO LOVELula CafeThe Logan Square restaurant that is all things to all people Mi Tocaya Antojer\u00edaA standout Mexican restaurant in a city of standout Mexican restaurantsSportsman's ClubThe best indoor/outdoor bar for simple/spot-on cocktailsExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
