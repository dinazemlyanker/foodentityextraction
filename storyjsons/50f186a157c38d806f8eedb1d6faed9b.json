(Catch me doing both at once and try not to judge.) Now I have a new source of daydream fuel: Snail World, an adorably surreal book of miniature dioramas starring a surprisingly adorable snail (plus a few other slimy friends).Created by artists Sam Copeland and snail devotee Aleia Murawski, each page is a snapshot from an alternate universe: a place where snails split a carton of buttery popcorn at the movies and flirt across burgers at a neon-lit diner. In other words it\u2019s exactly where I want to be right now. Check out some of my favorite food-fueled scenes below and get the full masterpiece on Broccoli Magazine\u2019s website.\u00a0What's in a snail's shopping cart? Whiskey, celery, and Doritos, of course.\u00a0\nAleia Murawski and Sam CopelandA good reminder to take a lunch break\u2014without a computer on the table.\u00a0\nAleia Murawski and Sam CopelandEven snails know that true love is better with movie theater popcorn.\nAleia Murawski and Sam Copeland10/10, would snuggle up on a lettuce leaf.\u00a0\nAleia Murawski and Sam CopelandHonestly, this snail has a better breakfast nook than anyone I know.\u00a0\nAleia Murawski and Sam CopelandActual footage of me on New Year's Eve.
