When something's so easy to make that you don't even need one. Welcome to It's That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we make with our eyes closed.I\u2019m not big on apple-picking or cider donuts, but I can\u2019t let October pass by without carving at least one pumpkin. And while my jack o\u2019 lanterns are never as spooky as expected, my roasted pumpkin seeds are reliably delicious\u2014and super easy to make at home. I\u2019ve even been known to host pumpkin carving parties to double my yield (so when I invite you over, well, that\u2019s why). Here\u2019s how to do it at home.Step 1: Select your pumpkin. I've found that the bigger the pumpkin, the bigger (and tougher) the seeds. Because I\u2019d prefer not to spend my evening chewing pumpkin seeds, I opt for a medium-sized pumpkin. You do you.Step 2: Carve your pumpkin. Okay, you\u2019ve probably done this before, but here\u2019s a quick refresher: Use a sharp knife to cut around the pumpkin stem, pull off the top, and scoop out the insides (a serving spoon does a good job, as does an ice cream scoop). If you\u2019re intimidated by the sticky-slimy pumpkin guts, channel the bravery of your second grade self who held an eyeball (okay, a peeled grape) at a haunted house and dive in. Use a fork to scrape the sides and dislodge any stubborn strands, then use your fingertips to pinch the seeds off the pulp and put them in a bowl.Step 3: Prep the seeds. I know you want to start working on that jack o\u2019 lantern, but maximize your time and do this first. Fill the bowl with water and swirl around the seeds, using your fingers to remove any stuck-on pieces of pulp. Then use a slotted spoon to skim the seeds off the top, and place on a clean kitchen towel to dry out for about an hour. It's worth the wait: Allowing the seeds to dry first ensures they\u2019ll crisp\u2014not steam\u2014in the oven, allowing for maximum crunch. Carve your pumpkin while you wait!Step 4: Season the seeds. Preheat your oven to 325\u00b0 F with a rack in the middle. Add your dry pumpkin seeds to a rimmed baking sheet, then toss with a few tablespoons of olive oil, a pinch of kosher salt, and two teaspoons of your preferred spices. I usually opt for a smoky mix of cayenne pepper and paprika, but do what feels right. Smoked paprika, za\u2019atar, and even cinnamon all work great. Use your hands and really get in there to make sure each seed is evenly coated.Step 5: Roast! You want toasty, golden brown pumpkin seeds, which should take around 20 minutes. Give them a shake halfway through to assess the browning and ensure an even bake. If your seeds are large or not fully dry, this will take a little longer, so keep an eye on things and stay patient. For slightly cheesy pumpkin seeds, immediately them toss with a drizzle of olive oil and a few shakes of nutritional yeast once they\u2019re out of the oven.Step 6: MunchI love to use roasted pumpkin seeds to top hearty fall salads and creamy, coconutty squash soups.But if we\u2019re being honest, I usually just eat them by the handful. It\u2019s a seasonally festive, deliciously salty snack\u2014and just the thing to balance out a few (okay, five) Reese's peanut butter cups on Halloween.Still need something sweet?Suspiciously Cheesy Apple Crumb BarsIncorporating Cheez-Its into the dough results in a toasty, buttery flavor that your friends will be able to identify as deliciousness, but not necessarily as cheesiness.
