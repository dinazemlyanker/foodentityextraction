However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\u200b\u200bI consider myself a minimalist when it comes to most things (if minimalist means wearing jeans I bought in college and using my Danskos as winter boots)\u2014but not when it comes to baking tools.I am powerless in the face of a tiny spatula. I neeeeed another Bundt pan\u2014can\u2019t you see that one has a swirl design while the other is a series of peaks?! And you can bet that one of the first things on my...I mean \u201cour\u201d...wedding registry was a kitchen torch.So the best gifts for bakers like me are the kitchen tools and pastry paraphernalia that we both need (you can never have too many Silpats) and want (do you know about rose gold sprinkles?). This holiday season give me a baking gift (or five!) that\u2019s going to make my time in the kitchen more fun and my sourdough loaves more beautiful. And if it also makes my cabinets just a little more cluttered, so be it.We\u2019ve divided this list into three sections. Something from the \u201cExtremely Necessary\u201d category would make a perfect gift for bakers who are just starting out. The tools and gadgets in the \u201cNice to Have\u201d section are for home cooks who already own the basics and want to level up. And for the advanced bread baker or semi-pro pastry chef in your life, check out the gift ideas in the \u201cAbove and Beyond\u201d section. Put together a lil\u2019 package for your favorite baker\u2014or print out the list, highlight what you want, and leave it casually tucked under your next batch of brownies for all to see.Extremely NecessarySilicone spatulaHigh-quality flexible \u201cspats\u201d (as the kids say, I'm pretty sure) are the new wooden spoons. Use them for everything from stirring butter as it browns to scraping batter out of a bowl to spreading frosting across a cake. Also: tapping your partner gently on the butt. If you really want to impress your friend, get them two in different colors so they can use one solely for caramelized onions and the other for chocolate, sugar, and butter. This eliminates any cross-contamination and takes care of the Lingering Odor Problem.GIR Ultimate Spatula$13 at Bon App\u00e9tit MarketWhiskForks are great\u2014I use one every day\u2014but they can\u2019t do what whisks can. Whisks not only combine and lighten dry ingredients, eliminating pesky lumps, but they also aerate eggs and cream for maximum fluffiness. I suggest going with a slender whisk\u2014either mini or French-style\u2014so that it can fit in as many different vessels as possible. Unless someone regularly whips eggs for 50, a big balloon whisk will just gather dust.Kuhn Rikon 10-Inch French Whisk$18 at AmazonMeasuring cupsMaybe you\u2019re a nonna who measures by palmfuls, or maybe you\u2019re the rest of us. We like this set made from biodegradable bamboo fiber.Bamboozle Measuring Cup Set$18 at Bon App\u00e9tit MarketMeasuring spoonsI\u2019m not confident enough in my estimation skills to eyeball a teaspoon of salt without screwing up my entire cake. Are you? Two sets (again in biodegradable bamboo) is better than one so that you don\u2019t have to constantly wash between vinaigrette and angel food cake batter.Bamboozle Measuring Spoon Set$10 at Bon App\u00e9tit MarketLiquid measuring cupThe last time I asked my dad to pass me the liquid measuring cup, he was flabbergasted. There is a difference between a liquid measuring cup and a dry measuring cup, Dad, and for precision you need both. I like the flexible silicone ones from Oxo, which stay cool to the touch, even right from the microwave.OXO 2-Cup Squeeze & Pour Silicone Measuring Cup$11 at Amazon$11 at Sur La TableRimmed half sheet panOne word: cookies. Two more words: roasted nuts. Last words: sponge cake. The baker in your life may already own one, but they will not be mad about an extra baking sheet or two. Our favorite one, by Nordic Ware, always makes a good gift.Nordic Ware Half Sheet Pan$20 at Bon App\u00e9tit MarketMixing bowlsYou could buy a fancy set of ceramic mixing bowls. But why? These biodegradable bamboo bowls are lightweight, so they\u2019re a lot more likely to get used. They come seven to a set, ideal for everything from beating a single egg to making a jumbo batch of pumpkin pancake batter.Bamboozle 7-Piece Nesting Bowls$80 at Bon App\u00e9tit Market$80 at Food52Oven thermometerList of those who lie to you: parents, teachers, meteorologists, landlords, your oven thermometer. If you think that setting the dial to 350 means the temp is 350, you\u2019re living a lie, my friend. If you already have one (good for you), buy one for the friend who serves you flat cookies or burned cake\u2014maybe they\u2019ll get the hint? A cheapo dangly oven thermometer is better than nothing, but if you're serious about baking, spring for BA\u2019s favorite.Photo by Emma FishmanThermoWorks DOT Thermometer$45 at ThermoWorksFine-mesh strainersFor getting lumps out of cocoa powder without sifting. Or showering a cake with powdered sugar. Or smoothing a pudding that\u2019s lumpier than intended. Get a set of three stainless-steel strainers and use the big one for washing grains and the little guy for straining loose-leaf tea.IPOW Stainless Steel Fine Mesh Strainers, Set of 3$11 at AmazonSquare panI don\u2019t care if you get an 8\"x8\" or a 9\"x9\". You need one. Brownies, blondies, lemon bars, crumble bars, all the sorts of \u201chumble\u201d and \u201clow-maintenance\u201d desserts \u00a0you take to \u201cbake sales\u201d (or just hoard for yourself).USA Pan Square 8-inch Cake Pan$21 $20 at Amazon$20 at Williams SonomaRound cake panHow else will you make a birthday cake? If you don\u2019t have a birthday cake, how can you have a birthday? Will time simply stop? I, for one, don\u2019t want to find out. I like an 8\" or 9\" pan with high sides: It\u2019s less likely that batter will spill over and make a mess.Photo by Laura MurrayFat Daddio's Round Cake Pan, 9 x 3 Inch$14 at Amazon9\"x13\" panComes in handy for sheet cakes and big batches of blondies and DIY ice cream bars (hey, it could happen) but also for lasagnas, baked pastas, enchiladas, and slow-roasted veg. Don\u2019t forget kugel! If you\u2019re torn between buying glass or metal, go with metal: It\u2019s more versatile and will give you crispier edges and better browning. I highly recommend this dish from Nordic Ware because it comes with a cover so I don\u2019t have to waste plastic wrap or aluminum foil when I\u2019m carrying a cake to the dinner party.Nordic Ware Classic Metal 9x13 Covered Cake Pan$24 $15 at AmazonMicroplaneDo you know someone who zests citrus with the big holes of a box grater? Do the right thing and get them Microplane, the only tool for the job. Also nice for grating ginger, garlic, chiles, and parm. I bought one of these for a friend when I saw what her \u201cminced garlic\u201d looked like. I swear that sounds more passive aggressive than it was!Microplane Fine Grater$18 at AmazonNice to HaveKitchen scaleWe live in a world where our phones know how many steps we take during the day and where we parked the car\u2014so why do we put up with 1 cup of flour being anywhere between 115 and 140 grams? That\u2019s not precision! That\u2019s not 2021 technology! Keep a set of measuring cups for chocolate chips and nuts, grated cheese and frozen peas, but use a scale for ingredients like flour and brown sugar. Not only will you have fewer dishes left in the sink, but also your desserts will come out the way recipe developers like me intended.Escali Primo P115C Precision Kitchen Food Scale$20 at Target$25 at AmazonMini offset spatulaYour new best friend for cake decorating. Use it to make dramatic whirls of frosting on tiered showstoppers or humble cupcakes (don\u2019t even get me started on the wonders it can work on whipped cream) but also to swoop hummus; smear butter, jam, and cream cheese; and pop muffins out of their tins.Ateco 4.5-Inch Offset Spatula$11 at AmazonCitrus squeezerThis citrus juicer squeezes, strains, measures, and features cup-to-oz.-to-Tbsp.-to-ml conversions\u2014a true one-stop shop. I see lemon pound cake in your near future.OXO Good Grips Small Citrus Juicer$11 at AmazonCookie scoopA cookie scoop is one of the best gifts for bakers and bakers\u2019 roommates alike: The easier it is to scoop cookies, the more cookies that get made. A scooper also creates cookies of the exact same size, which will prevent said roommates from fighting over who gets the biggest one. Also good for portioning meatballs.Medium #40 Cookie Scoop$16 at AmazonRolling pinSure, you could use an empty wine bottle to roll out your dough\u2014but wouldn\u2019t it be nice to graduate? A French-style rolling pin, essentially a big, slightly tapered dowel, gives you the most control.Photo by Chelsie CraigFrench Rolling Pin$17 at Amazon$17 at Sur La TablePastry brushFor applying glazes and egg washes gently and evenly. (No, a toothbrush is not an acceptable substitute.)OXO Good Grips 1.5 Inch Pastry Brush$8 at Amazon$8 at Bed Bath & BeyondKitchen timersThe home baker who multitasks is not satisfied with a phone timer alone! These come in a pack of two, which means you can do at least three things at once (and four if you borrow your girlfriend\u2019s phone, too!).Uigos 2 Pack Digital Kitchen Timer$10 $9 at AmazonHand mixerNo matter how strong you are, you won\u2019t be able to cream butter and sugar as well as an electric mixer can. Trust me, a motor-powered mixer will open up a whole new world of baking for you (and allow you to save your arm strength for tasks that really matter, like opening the pickle jar).Cuisinart 5-Speed Hand Mixer$40 at Amazon$40 at Williams SonomaPlastic dough scraperUse it to scoop the last bits of a clingy dough out of the mixing bowl or to transfer a pile of chopped chocolate or nuts to the awaiting brownie batter. Sort of like the flat side of a knife but without that scary blade getting in the way.Ateco Bowl Scraper$3 at AmazonMuffin tinNot necessary bakeware but very welcome. Especially if you\u2019re into the idea of making a big batch of muffins over the weekend and sticking them in the freezer\u2014and then microwaving one every morning for a warm, comforting breakfast in a snap. Just a thought!Cupcake and Muffin Pan$30 $27 at Amazon$28 at Bed Bath & BeyondLoaf panWhere overripe bananas and extra carrots go to heaven. But wait, it can be used for so much more than baked goods (do you meatloaf?). Loaf pans come in a variety of dimensions, but the 9x5\" won\u2019t let you down.Chicago Metallic 9-inch-by-5-inch Loaf Pan$13 at AmazonPie plateYou can\u2019t make a pie without a pie dish. But you can make a galette without a pie dish, and that\u2019s why this is included in the \u201cnice to have\u201d section. :-)USA Pan Aluminized Steel 9-inch Pie Pan$19 $15 at AmazonAbove & BeyondScissorsSo you got the pie plate (see directly above), now you need powerful, precise scissors to trim away the excess pie crust before you get to crimping. I love these little guys from Joyce Chen, which also work wonders for cutting dried fruit, snipping herbs, and even breaking down a chicken. Just remember to clean them between each use.Joyce Chen Unlimited Kitchen Scissors$30 $18 at AmazonStand mixerDoes your spouse need a stand mixer? Not necessarily. Do they want a stand mixer? Absolutely. Get the KitchenAid.Photo by Microulis MikeKitchenAid Classic Plus Series 4.5-Quart Tilt-Head Stand Mixer$260 at Amazon$260 at KitchenAidPastry levelersRaise your hand if you have an obsessive attention to detail! Precision enthusiasts know that these dough rulers are the only way to guarantee every section of your sugar cookie dough is exactly \u00bc\" thick all over. Simply sandwich your dough between two of these plastic strips and use that rolling pin to level it out evenly.Fat Daddio's Dough Leveler Set$26 at AmazonSilicone baking matThis reusable, extremely nonstick silicone mat gives parchment paper a run for its money. It\u2019ll expedite your cleanup (no more scrubbing gunk off of sheet pans), provide impeccable heat distribution for perfectly baked cookies, and create a smooth surface for kneading dough.Photo by Chelsie Craig OXO Good Grips Silicone Baking Mat$21 $17 at AmazonFancy loaf panFor when you\u2019re sick of people thinking that your banana bread is cute and you want them to think it\u2019s sexy and glamorous instead. The difference between kitten heels and stilettos, if you will.Photo by Chelsie CraigNordic Ware Fluted Loaf Pan$36 at Bon App\u00e9tit Market$34 at Sur La TableSpringform panEver heard of CHEESECAKE? Any time you\u2019re baking a cake that needs to come out of the pan but cannot be flipped\u2014maybe it\u2019s fragile or layered or both\u2014you need a springform. This lovely one has a glass bottom that doubles as a serving plate, which saves you from the often scary and sometimes fatal task of scooting the cake off its base.Glass Bottom Springform Pan$40 at Food52Tart pan with removable bottomNot all tarts involve pastry cream. Not all tarts are complicated. But almost all tarts are beautiful. It\u2019s something to do with that fluted edge, I think. Be sure to get one with a removable bottom so you can slip away the sides of the pan like magic.Fox Run Removable Bottom Tart Pan, 9-Inch Diameter$15 at AmazonBundt panThere\u2019s nothing special about a Bundt cake except for its shape. But that\u2019s good enough for me! They\u2019re especially wonderful looking when glazed.Nordic Ware Anniversary Bundt 12 Cup, Gold$38 at Amazon$38 at Food52Cake standYou\u2019ve baked the most beautiful layer cake of your life\u2014now present it in equally stunning fashion. A cake plate with a cloche will protect your masterpiece as it moves from counter to refrigerator to table (and this one doubles as a punch bowl).Anchor Hocking Cake Plate With Dome$41 at AmazonNested biscuit and cookie cuttersA set of cutters in different sizes is great for cookies, biscuits, scones, and cobbler and decorating the top of a double-crust pie.Round Cookie Cutter Set, 12-Pack$12 at AmazonCooling rackIf you want to win that cookie swap this year, you need to cool your linzers properly. If you\u2019re baking big batches of cookies and have a tiny kitchen, consider a stackable rack.Nordic Ware Stackable Cooling Racks, 2 Piece$27 at Amazon$34 at Food52Pre-cut parchment roundsBaking should be fun, not as tedious as a kindergarten craft project. If you\u2019re tired of tracing infinite circles onto rolls of parchment, spring for pre-cut parchment rounds. (These liners also come in half-sheet-pan size too for all your cookie baking needs.)Parchment Paper Baking Sheets Round$13 $11 at AmazonCookie/cake carrierHow are you going to safely transport those 24 elaborately frosted cupcakes (thanks, mini offset spatula) to the school bake sale? Cardboard boxes and prayers? This handled storage container will protect layer cakes, frosted cookies, and gooey lemon squares from transportation mishaps.Snap 'N Stack 2-Layer Storage Carrier$55 at AmazonNow go bake a cake:This piece was originally published in 2019 and was updated in 2021.Explore Bon App\u00e9titGift GuidesGiftsShoppingRecipes you want to make.
