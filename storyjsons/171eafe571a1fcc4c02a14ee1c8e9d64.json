When I spotted Evergreen\u2019s zucchini and carrot waffles in the frozen aisle at Whole Foods, I thought I might be able to change that. But compared to my beloved vanilla protein oats and peanut butter, these savory rectangles just never called my name in the morning\u2014so they sat lonely in my freezer, collecting ice.That was before I discovered lunch waffles.One day I had whipped up a pot of homemade tomato soup. As I was about to ladle out a bowl, it dawned on me: We were out of bread. And let\u2019s be real, what\u2019s a bowl of tomato soup without a toasty, gooey square of grilled cheese to dip right in there?Then I remembered those waffles languishing in the freezer.Digging through my fridge, I found a fresh log of goat cheese. I swung open the door to my freshly Marie Kondo\u2019d pantry and a light shone upon my beloved bottle of Mike\u2019s Hot Honey. It was all coming together. My husband looked at me like I was nuts, but I was a woman on a mission. What had started as a potential disappointment turned out to be the first of many veggie waffle lunches.Here\u2019s how to do it: Stick a couple of these zucchini and carrot waffles in the toaster until they\u2019re hot and golden brown. Then spread them (holes-side up) with a layer of creamy goat cheese, stack them all artsy-like on a plate, and drizzle with hot honey. Serve adjacent to your favorite bowl of soup and dunk to your heart\u2019s content. Extra napkins advised for worth-it sticky fingers.You can, of course, use whatever waffles you want for lunch waffles, but I like Evergreen for a few reasons. They come in an adorable mini size, meaning it\u2019s NBD to toss one (or four) into the toaster depending on how hungry you are. Second, the ingredients are all things you\u2019d find in your own kitchen\u2014whole grain flour, honey, eggs, almonds, carrots, zucchini, avocado oil, baking soda, cinnamon, salt. Each serving has 6 grams of protein and 4 grams of fiber. And they taste great, especially with a little goat cheese and hot honey.
