I\u2019d assembled these friends (maybe former friends, now) as human guinea pigs with one purpose: To find the very stinkiest cheese. Submitted for our approval were seven assertive, pungent, and occasionally quite freaky creations\u2014provided by Murray\u2019s Cheese and curated by Elizabeth Chubbuck, the Greenwich Village\u2013based cheese purveyor\u2019s senior vice president of sales and marketing and, as far as my nose is concerned, a diabolical dairy-wielding sadist. (A very nice sadist, but still.)It was one of the first warm days of spring, and a pair of oscillating fans somewhat counterproductively wafted the sinus-charring bouquet from room to room, like Miss Havisham thwacking you in the face with her long-rotten flowers. My normally mild-mannered dog lost her mind, yowling and dancing around the kitchen until someone, anyone, would give her even the smallest morsel of cheese. Oh god, she needs it, just give it to her.My table was laid out, for the most part, with six washed-rind cheeses, which are renowned among the stinkiest that the world has to offer. \u201cYou\u2019re generally taking a soft ripened cheese and washing its rind in a solution that contains Brevibacterium linens,\u201d explained Nora Weiser, executive director of the American Cheese Society. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of disgusting, but it\u2019s a bacteria that\u2019s found on our bodies and in human sweat, so it gives it the cheese kind of a stinky foot smell.\u201d Weiser assured me that a stinky cheese\u2019s bark\u2014well, its odor\u2014is almost always worse than its bite. \u201cThe flavor tends to be generally much milder than the scent, especially if you\u2019re tasting the paste, the interior, as opposed to the rind,\u201d she said. \u201cThe way your nose recognizes the stink versus the way you recognize it on your palate when you\u2019re eating it is very different.\u201dThe Farm TeamWe started slow, dipping a toe into the shallow end of the stinky-cheese pool. First up was Scharfe Maxx Extra, a sweet French-onion-soupy and Nosferatu-pale Alpine hard cheese with only the faint funk of a shirt you\u2019ve worn twice without washing, which led me to wonder if I\u2019d taken home a flagrantly unstinky specimen by mistake. Brie Fermier, the only bloomy-rind cheese (with a soft, fluffy mold on its surface) in the bunch, was entry-level stinky with a pleasant brininess and an unmistakable note of brussels sprouts in both its flavor and odor. Gooey spruce-bound Greensward smelled like musty Christmas but tasted like mushrooms, miso soup, and some kind of elegant, artisanal, and altogether delicious\u2014hear me out\u2014hot dog. It was an instant lock for my mouth\u2019s all-time cheese hall of fame.The Major LeaguesAnd then came the Dorset, with which, hoo boy, we graduated with honors to the second circle of stinkiness. To some in attendance, the smell of this raw cow\u2019s-milk cheese was the most objectionable they encountered all evening. The Dorset\u2019s taste was deeply, delectably meaty, but the inescapable smell made me think of a long-abandoned, possibly haunted high school boys\u2019 locker room\u2014or at least, what I imagine a long-abandoned, possibly haunted high school boys\u2019 locker room to smell like. My friend Gabrielle compared it to the pee-drenched alley next to a dive bar. My fianc\u00e9 and his sister, the only two people in the room who were unfazed by the Dorset fumes, said it reminded them of the Cantonese salted fish they grew up eating.I guarantee you that, in this lifetime, I will never taste, or smell, anything like Torta del Casar again. This Merino sheep\u2019s-milk cheese is from the Extremadura region of Spain and produced using the flower buds of the cardoon thistle. \u201cCardoon thistles have a very distinct flavor profile: It\u2019s like green apple Jolly Ranchers and GT\u2019s original flavor kombucha combined,\u201d said Chubbuck. I actually liked the bright yet sweaty scent of the Torta del Casar: equal parts vaguely sweet dandruff, stale cheddar-cheese popcorn in a tin from last year\u2019s holiday season, and sub-toenail crud of mysterious origin. I can\u2019t say the same for the taste. Imagine a gamey dark chocolate cut with the chemical shiver of accidentally spraying perfume directly into one\u2019s mouth. Overall, this cheese ranked last on our collective list of favorites to eat: If the Brie Fermier was the evening\u2019s Miss Congeniality, then Torta del Casar was a rogue contestant hellbent on burning the whole pageant down.The funkmaster is present.\nPhoto by Alex LauThe World Series\u201c\u00c9poisses is the quintessential funkmaster,\u201d Chubbuck told me. According to legend, this famously stinky cheese was banned from public transportation in France. It certainly lived up to its internationally law-flaunting reputation. This unassuming disk delivers a strong Windex hit of ammonia, despite the fact that hiding beneath its rind is what tastes like an irresistible bacon pudding. One friend described the smell of \u00c9poisses as a sidewalk fish market without an awning, the sun burning down on it all afternoon.But in my estimation, the ultimate funkmaster\u2014and there can only be one\u2014is U Pecorinu, our ovine demon-king. When I first unwrapped this Corsican sheep\u2019s-milk cheese, a round in a truly aggressive shade of orange, the smell of washed-up sea trash baking under a boardwalk launched me into a minor coughing fit. \u201cI have a client who wants cheeses that smell like the chicken coop. That is the cheese that brings him the most joy. It is gnarly and funky but hard to come by,\u201d Chubbuck said. It is also, like someone in my apartment less affectionately put it, \u201clike eating somebody\u2019s armpit.\u201d My friend Susan\u2014who, it should be noted, enjoyed eating this cheese so much she took it home with her\u2014compared it to a hamster cage that\u2019s long overdue for a cleaning. The actual taste was thoroughly barnyardy but approachable, balancing that ineffable chicken coopiness with a more familiar nutty quality.Even the meanest, most offensive-smelling cheeses can reveal untold wonders on the palate\u2014they just require a little patience and an open mind. The Torta del Casar, which will haunt my tongue (if not my nose) in my dreams, found a fervent fan in my friend Brian, who explained that he couldn\u2019t think of single reference point in his food memories that could even approximate those crazy-ass flavors. How often does anyone get to have that experience in their adult lives?Chubbuck\u2019s advice for those new to stinky cheese: \u201cOnce you have decided that you\u2019re going to try to learn how to enjoy something that is challenging for you, there\u2019s this process of saying, \u2018Okay, I know it has these intense aromas, but I also know that once I get over my initial reaction, it\u2019s going to taste like French onion soup, and that\u2019s an experience I want to have.\u2019\u201dRemember, don\u2019t judge a book by its cover, even if that cover happens to smell like old socks, discovered by nostril-pinching archeologists, centuries later in a definitely haunted high school boys\u2019 locker room.Read more: The 25 Most Important Cheeses in America, According to Cheese ExpertsExplore Bon App\u00e9titCheeseCheese WeekRead MorecultureThe Science Behind Why We Love Stinky CheeseBy Alyse WhitneyRecipes you want to make.
