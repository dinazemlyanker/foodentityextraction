It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Gobbles and SquabblesA funny thing about working at Bon App\u00e9tit is that your family doesn\u2019t care that you work at Bon App\u00e9tit. Every year, this becomes more and more apparent when we all return to the office with stories of our Thanksgiving dinner dramas. For example, my dad read Adam\u2019s newsletter about Pumpkin Chiffon Pie\u2014and then went and made ANOTHER WEBSITE\u2019S PUMPKIN CHIFFON PIE RECIPE. Dad, why!? So for the second year in a row, here\u2019s a special edition of Unnecessary Food Feud of the Week: Family Feud Edition!Amanda Shapiro laments: \u201cDude, my mom made a big f-ing deal about me scrubbing all the sweet potatoes before roasting them even though she bought ORGANIC, then she DIDN\u2019T EVEN EAT HER SKINS.\u201d\u201cMy grandmother and uncle were BUGGING at the prep steps I forced them to do for Andy and Brad\u2019s turkey,\u201d reports Emily Schultz. They asked: \u201cWhat are we asking the butcher to do? Separate it? Separate what?!!!\u201d (The butcher was happy to oblige, and even said he was getting more requests this year than ever to break the turkey down. Coincidence?) \u201cAnd we\u2019re leaving it uncovered? In the refrigerator? For two days? And you\u2019re sure this is safe??\u201d (No one was poisoned.) \u201cSoy Sauce? I\u2019m not even going to ask.\u201d (Schultz is now allowed to make the turkey every year.)Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!As if this galette weren\u2019t impressive enough already?\nMichael Graydon + Nikole HerriottRachel Karten sends a postcard: \u201cI went to my boyfriend\u2019s Thanksgiving and brought heavy cream and maple syrup to make the maple whipped cream for Alison Roman\u2019s Salted-Butter Apple Galette. Before dessert was served, I asked for a bowl and whisk. And they were like, \u2018you can\u2019t make whipped cream like that\u2014it\u2019s going to take you HOURS.\u2019 They gathered around in disbelief to watch me make whipped cream from scratch. Anyway, it took seven minutes and everyone said the dessert was FANTASTIC. Not really a feud, but a reminder that making whipped cream from scratch is extremely delicious and, in some cases, very impressive.\u201d\u201cSave it for divorce court!\u201d said Carla Lalli Music. \u201cI pay a therapist to hear this stuff and you want it for free!!??\u201dKate Fenoglio says: \u201cAfter spending two days baking, including the most perfect pumpkin pie I\u2019ve ever made, my mom goes to the grocery store and comes back with a store-bought pumpkin pie!!!! She argued it was so people could have another slice of pie in the morning with coffee, but I made sure to give her a hard time about not having faith in my baking skills. (She definitely does and took about 15 photos of my pumpkin pie.)\u201d\u201cI wanted people to not eat my cookies before Thanksgiving dinner had even hit the table, but that didn't happen,\u201d sighs Emma Wartzman. \u201cI feuded with everyone.\u201d\u201cMy friend and I argued about how early is too early to eat on Thanksgiving,\u201d Christa Guerra recalls. \u201cHe wanted to eat at 1 p.m. like a grandma, but then you don\u2019t get to graze on appetizers for six hours before!\u201d\u201cMy girlfriend\u2019s grandmother wanted Stove-Top stuffing,\u201d says Bryan Fountain, \u201cso we made that and one from scratch. She had a bite of the homemade, ate two servings, and did not touch the Stove-Top. It was annoying and satisfying at the same time.\u201dA leeeettle too crispy.\nAliza Abarbanel discovered her family\u2019s oven is 100 (100!) degrees off, so her puff pastry for Claire Saffitz\u2019s apple tart burnt. Bad. \u201cWe ate the apples off the top though!\u201dSarah Jampel has a relative who \u201conly makes food that tastes like mothballs.\u201d They brought a green bean casserole with apparently raw green beans bobbing around in a vat of extremely liquidy soup with \u201clittle blobs of fried onions on top, like wet dog turds.\u201d Vivid!Christina Chaey had a lot on her mind: \u201cI...forgot to oil the bird before it went into the oven and then my mom and I argued for the next 3 hours about when to baste it with butter. We poured a melted half-stick over the poor thing once I realized the error of my ways (but not revealing to anyone, of course) which was...exactly 10 minutes before it came out of the oven. Oops.\u201dThe following people had beautiful, peaceful Thanksgivings. Or they\u2019re lying to me: Chris Morocco (\u201cno one went to the hospital!\u201d), Molly Baz (\u201cI went to Paris!\u201d), Alex Delany (\u201cI get along with my family!\u201d), Sohla El-Waylly (\u201cMaybe your newsletter should be about how great our Thanksgivings were!\u201d), Brad Leone (ate lobster), and Adam Rapoport (\u201cI was face-down on the sectional nine minutes after dinner was over.\u201d).Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterThanksgivingRead MoreLifestyle[*whispers*] I Don\u2019t Like ThanksgivingBy Amanda ShapirocultureShrimp Scampi Pasta for the Hesitant Home CookBy Alex BeggscultureWhat to Cook When It\u2019s Dark at 4 p.m.By Alex BeggscultureMore Prunes!
