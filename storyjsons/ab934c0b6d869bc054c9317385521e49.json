Click to see all the stories.One of the big reasons I started Popoca was to show people that Salvadoran food is unique, that there\u2019s more to it than pupusas. I had always cooked progressive American food, but I never felt like the food was mine. I began spending more time in El Salvador visiting family there, and every time I would try a new dish I was amazed. Finally, I was like, \u201cI\u2019m Salvadoran, this is what I should be doing.\u201d Once I started studying and staging and exploring more, I knew this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. The recipes and techniques in this story are versions of the ones that drew me into this world of cooking, modified first for my restaurant and then again for the home cook. They\u2019re the ones that made me want to dig deeper, and I think that they can do that for you too.Here are the recipes, techniques, and ingredients that drew Salguero in:All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

It\u2019s basically a radish pico de gallo. The combination of radish and chile delivers two kinds of heat: The radish gives that peppery, nose-clearing spice while the chile gets your tongue tingling. Crunchy, spicy, and acidic, it\u2019s exactly what you want with steak.\u201dView RecipePhoto by Andria Lo, prop styling by Jillian Knox2/11Super-Fry Your Beans\u201cThere are lots of different kinds of refried beans throughout the country, but in some mountain towns, you\u2019ll get these amazing, really dense beans. My cousin calls them triple-fried, but it\u2019s more like a thousand times fried. You just keep adding fat until the beans are thick enough to stand up on a plate, which is very common as part of a Salvadoran breakfast, with tortillas, eggs, fried plantains, avocado, and queso. They\u2019re often made with lard, but I make mine with olive oil. It\u2019s a little healthier, plus I\u2019m cooking in California, so I try to be respectful of vegetarians who come in.\u201dView RecipePhoto by Andria Lo3/11Expand Your Tortilla Horizons\u201cSalvadoran tortillas are really different from Mexican ones. They\u2019re still made with masa but formed by hand, never pressed, and thicker\u2014basically a pupusa with no filling. They\u2019re perfect for sopping up flavorful sauces and stews. The thing is, you can\u2019t really get them in stores. But if you don\u2019t want to make them, a soft baguette like the kind used for banh mi is the best (and most common) substitute.\u201dPhoto by Andria Lo, prop styling by Jillian Knox4/11Make It Rain Relajo All Over Crispy Shrimp\u201cRelajo is the foundation of so many Salvadoran dishes, but the spice mix varies depending on the dish or the cook. There are certain consistent elements\u2014bay leaves, achiote, chiles, cumin seeds, sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds\u2014and then more idiosyncratic additions like peanuts. It hits my palate like a Mexican mole and adds complexity to even simple dishes like this quick saut\u00e9ed shrimp.\u201dView RecipePhoto by Andria Lo, prop styling by Jillian Knox5/11More Ways to Use It\u00a0Enhance your braises: \u201cWhen I\u2019m almost done sweating aromatics, I stir in a couple spoonfuls of relajo, then add liquid and whatever meat I want to cook low and slow.\u201dTurn it into a rub: \u201cI season pork chops with relajo and a little salt, then grill. A squeeze of lime afterward is essential.\u201dToss with fried potatoes: \u201cI add a few big pinches while the potatoes are hot, which brings out their flavor.\u201dView RecipePhotographs by Andria Lo, prop styling by Jillian Knox6/11Warm Up With Chilate\u201cI gravitate to hot drinks on a menu\u2014eggnog, hot buttered rum, you name it. I love feeling cozy, and chilate, a spiced masa-and-milk-based drink, is the epitome of cozy beverages. I learned about this version, which swaps cashews for masa, at a restaurant that let me crash its kitchen for a couple weeks. I like that it\u2019s easy to make, and that you don\u2019t need great masa.\u201dView RecipePhoto by Andria Lo, prop styling by Jillian Knox7/11Add a Pinch of Alguashte to Brothy Clams\u201cSquash and pumpkins are huge crops in El Salvador, and the seeds never go to waste\u2014they get toasted and ground to create alguashte. At the restaurant I stir it into a seafood stew that\u2019s typically made with baby crabs, though here I\u2019ve done it with clams. The alguashte adds a deep nuttiness and crunchy texture.\u201dView RecipePhoto by Andria Lo, prop styling by Jillian Knox8/11Alguashte All the WaysPair it with fruit: \u201cAlguashte often tops fresh fruit along with lime and hot sauce. It\u2019s amazing on pineapple and mango, but also with plums, pears, and citrus.\u201dAdd it to a broth: \u201cI\u2019m into making the same alguashte-enriched broth for the clams but using other proteins like shrimp, black cod, even chicken.\u201dFinish everything with it: \u201cI sprinkle the powder on scrambled eggs, vanilla ice cream, buttered popcorn\u2014anything that wants a little toasty flavor and salt.\u201dView Recipe9/11Needs More Worcestershire SauceIn El Salvador, Worcestershire sauce\u2014or salsa inglesa as it\u2019s called there\u2014is everywhere. It\u2019s always on the table when you\u2019re eating hanger steak or other grilled meats, but it\u2019s also a central ingredient in a lot of ceviches and the Salvadoran version of a michelada. People add it to club soda, which kind of reminds me of the salted lime sodas you get at Vietnamese restaurants, really refreshing. I love that it\u2019s not only salty but super savory, kind of like soy sauce, and lends an intense hit of umami to whatever you\u2019re eating or drinking.$15 at AmazonPhoto by Andria Lo, prop styling by Jillian Knox10/11Let Them Eat Quesadilla\u201cNot to be confused with the Mexican dish by the same name, Salvadoran quesadilla is a sweet-salty cheesecake that\u2019s often eaten for breakfast with coffee, but at the restaurant I serve it as dessert. I\u2019m not a huge dessert person, so it\u2019s perfect for me\u2014the Cotija adds a distinct salty funk that really balances all that sugar. I also like that it incorporates sesame seeds, which some people associate with Asian food but are actually a huge part of Salvadoran cuisine.\u201dView RecipePhoto by Andria Lo, prop styling by Jillian Knox11/11Pair Chicha With Chicken\u201cGallo en chicha is traditionally made with rooster that\u2019s braised in a pineapple-skin chicha, which brings these incredible sweet-sour notes. The first time I tried it, I was like, \u2018Holy s**t, why haven\u2019t I ever had this in the States?!\u2019 For this recipe I use chicken, which is why it\u2019s called pollo en chicha. I usually make chicha from scratch, but don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got you: A combination of pineapple juice and apple cider vinegar is a great substitute.\u201dView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsFirst PersonChefsRecipes you want to make.
