No exception. They were what I knew best. After years devouring them, I synonymized the subtle sharpness of mace in my grandmother\u2019s sweet potato pies and the deep warmth of my mother\u2019s cinnamon-tinged apple pies with the pinnacle of comfort. I was so fond of the sweet stuff that I didn\u2019t feel any real need to explore the world of savory pies. But that all changed once I stepped into Hoosier Mama in Evanston, Illinois.During my freshman year of college, right as the temperatures began to plummet below zero and the distance from my home in Houston started to feel real, I stumbled upon owner Paula Haney\u2019s Chicago-based mini chain. I found it during a delicate time in my life, a time when so many of my peers were reimagining themselves for an entirely new environment. But while they dyed their hair or picked up a new hobby, I chose to rebrand myself in a very specific way: As a savory pie person. That fateful, frigid day, I ordered Hoosier Mama\u2019s chicken pot pie and never looked back.The pie arrived in a flaky double crust laced with fresh thyme. Inside was shredded dark meat, tender from simmering in a rich cognac-spiked stock, and delicate bits of onions, carrots, and sweet peas, all swirling in a silken, peppery b\u00e9chamel. Warming and complex yet familiar and approachable, it was a pie that was new and exciting and made me forget all about my sweet tooth.Over the next three and a half years, I became a regular at Hoosier Mama, trying a new pie, from the smoky barbecue pork pie to the warming curry lamb one, every time a visited. With each first bite, I couldn\u2019t help but laugh at myself. I had been missing out on savory pies for so long. I know better now.Go there: Hoosier MamaExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsChicagoPot PieRead MorecookingPuff Pastry Exists To Make You Look Very Impressive\u00a0By Sarah JampelRecipes you want to make.
