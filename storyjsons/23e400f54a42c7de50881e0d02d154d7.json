It\u2019s not merely a recommendation, people: You should pretty much always be rinsing.But first\u2014to get it out of the way\u2014let's discuss the exceptions: congee, rice pudding, and risotto. In these dishes, the whole point is for the grains to become mushy in a good way.Compared to rinse two (shown above), the water is still super cloudy in rinse one (shown here).\u00a0\nPhoto by Laura Murray, Food Styling by Pearl JonesOther than in those particular circumstances, rinsing rice is worth the time, energy, and additional dirty dish. First off, rinsing gets rid of any bits of debris that ended up in the bag. More importantly, though, it washes off some of the surface starch. Starch is what causes all those aforementioned dishes to thicken. When the goal is fluffy, separated grains as opposed to a porridge-like consistency, that starch has got to go.To be clear, even when you rinse short-grain rice, like sushi rice, the cooked grains will still stick together (they\u2019re supposed to). Still, they\u2019ll lose any unpleasant gumminess. And when you rinse long-grain rice, like basmati or jasmine, you\u2019ll actually come away with individual, discrete grains.As you rinse rice, you'll be able to see the starch releasing into the water. If you\u2019re using a strainer (which works fine, though it can be annoying to clean), the stream passing through the rice will go from cloudy to relatively clear. We prefer to swoosh the rice around in a bowl full of cold water a couple of times, pouring out the water in one fluid, fast motion between rinses. (All of the rice, with the exception of a grain or two, will remain safely at the bottom of the bowl.) The difference from the first rinse to the third is glaringly apparent: The water will go from distinctly cloudy to clear enough that you should be able to see your submerged hand. It will never be crystal clear, but even a few rinses makes all the difference.Now that you've rinsed, you\u2019re well on your way to making Lemony Lentils and Rice with Caramelized Onions, or Fluffy Rice Pilaf with Curry, or the perfect landing pad for pork meatballs. It only took that one very easy, very quick (and, ahem, pretty much non-negotiable!) step.Get the recipe:Lemony Lentils and Rice With Caramelized OnionsThis recipe is inspired by mujadara, a simple combination of lentils, rice, and onions that exists in various forms across the Middle East. It's comforting but not too rich, and it's fresh and vegetarian without relying on many perishable ingredients. In other words, it's the perfect meal for the nights in between holiday parties.View RecipeRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
