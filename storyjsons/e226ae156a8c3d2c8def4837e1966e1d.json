(If that\u2019s not your thing, try this one.) Be sure to take them all the way to stiff peaks for a slice of pie that can hold its shape. Parbaking the graham cracker crust at a relatively low temperature for a longer period of time ensures a crisp and deeply fragrant crust that won\u2019t become soggy once the pumpkin filling is added.IngredientsMakes one 9\" deep-dish pieCrust12graham crackers2Tbsp. sugar\u00bctsp. kosher salt6Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted, slightly cooledFilling and Assembly1envelope unflavored gelatin (2\u00bd tsp.)1tsp. ground cinnamon\u00bctsp. ground nutmeg\u00be(scant) cup plus 2 Tbsp. sugar, divided\u00betsp. kosher salt, divided3large egg yolks\u00becup whole milk1\u00bccups unsweetened pumpkin pur\u00e9e (from one 15-oz. can)3large egg whites\u00becup heavy cream\u00bccup sour creamPreparationCrustStep 1Preheat oven to 325\u00b0. Pulse graham crackers in a food processor until broken down into fine crumbs (you should have about 2 cups). Set aside 2 Tbsp. graham cracker crumbs for serving. Add sugar and salt and pulse just to combine. Add butter and pulse until mixture is the consistency of wet sand.Step 2Transfer to a 9\u00bd\"-diameter deep pie dish. Using a measuring cup, press crumbs firmly onto bottom and up sides of dish. Bake crust until fragrant and edges just start to take on color, 20\u201325 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool.Filling and AssemblyStep 3Stir gelatin, cinnamon, nutmeg, a scant \u00bd cup sugar, and \u00bd tsp. salt in a small saucepan. Whisk egg yolks and milk in a small bowl to combine, then whisk into sugar mixture. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until mixture begins to thicken and coats the back of a spoon (but do not let it boil), about 5 minutes. Stir in pumpkin pur\u00e9e and remove from heat. Transfer to a large bowl and chill until cool, about 10 minutes.Step 4Meanwhile, using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat egg whites in a large bowl until soft peaks form. With the motor running, gradually add a scant \u00bc cup sugar and continue to beat until stiff peaks form, 5\u20137 minutes.Step 5Mix one-third of egg white mixture into chilled pumpkin mixture until smooth. Gently fold remaining egg white mixture into pumpkin mixture in 2 additions until incorporated, but don\u2019t overmix.Step 6Pour filling into graham cracker crust; smooth top. Cover and chill overnight.Step 7Vigorously whisk cream in a large bowl until medium peaks form. Fold in sour cream and remaining 2 Tbsp. sugar and \u00bc tsp. salt just to combine. If the cream looks like it could use another whisk or two to hold medium peaks, give it a whisk until it reaches the desired consistency. Using a large spoon, dollop a generous amount of whipped cream in the center of pie. Sprinkle with reserved graham cracker crumbs. Slice and serve with any remaining whipped cream alongside.How would you rate Pumpkin Chiffon Pie?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (45)Back to TopTriangleExcellent recipe !!!Sian LindemannChama, New Mexico12/25/2021I made 2 pies following this recipe except that I used fresh pumpkin. It is as light as air and the addition of the sour cream creates an addictive taste unlike any other! No one wanted my traditional pumpkin or apple pies and these were completely gone! I am making more for Christmas\n\nDelicious and uniqueDannae MarieKnoxville, TN12/23/2021This recipe is incredible! For anyone living outside of the U.S. (I\u2019m in Germany), Lotus Biscoff cookies with a bit of honey work beautifully as a replacement for graham crackers. I might even prefer it!KinseyMunich, Germany12/19/2021A great answer for those that like pumpkin pie but don\u2019t like that heavy, traditional texture. This is as light as can be and flavorful without being TOO pumpkin-y.T. Blumberg Chicago, IL11/26/2021I haven't made this but I was wondering if you could make it ahead and freeze it. CarolynPark City, UT11/20/2021Made this last week as a trial Thanksgiving pie run and, it is delicious! Followed the directions exactly and it turned out perfectly. Let the crust cool completely- about an hour before adding the filling and it shouldn\u2019t be soggy. I definitely recommend this as a different take on the classic pumpkin pie.Thank you BA!Katie Santa Rosa, CA11/12/2021Made it for a family gathering and the taste was a hit! Thanks Adam and Molly~\nHowever, the graham cracker crust got soggy and didn't hold together when I cut the slices and tried to lift them up, I ended up using a spoon and so the plating presentation suffered. It looks like in the video they served the pie immediately after making it, so I'll try making it the day of instead of chilling it overnight.yingmakesthingsAtlanta, GA5/4/2020This recipe is utter perfection. My family (who previously would not let me contribute pies due to the great cheesecake failure of 2006) was skeptical as I began whisking and food processing and promising that it was going to be hopefully delicious. But after a night of chilling we had the pie after our Thanksgiving dinner and it was immediately requested for Christmas. Thank you Adam for making my family take me seriously when saying \"I'll be bringing the pie!\"kimberlystephens13Brooklyn 1/16/2020This is the 3rd time I\u2019m making this recipe this holiday season and people love it!!! For whatever reason the salt amount is just way too much for us so I take down the salt content by about half but everything else about the recipe tastes amazing! And it is super easy to do hence me agreeably making it for a 3rd time lmaoJessica D.IL12/27/2019Absolutely adore this recipe and everyone I've served it to demands the recipe. I've already made it three times this holiday season and its not even Christmas yet. So easy, doesn't require lots of baking, ingredients are straightforward, and comes out the same every time. The only thing that I ever get wrong is the crust, it burns easily!AnonymousCalifornia12/16/2019Would one be able to sub the pumpkin for ube?Fork in ProgressCanada12/13/2019Great recipe! Much more tasty and interesting than others. The sour cream topping is the best part! Whisking it by hand was tiresome, I would use an electric mixer if you have it. julia5813arlington, va 12/9/2019the best! easy and light; it was a crowd pleaser! I threw out my old Paula Deen recipe and will use this one from here to eternity.  thank you for the recipe. AnonymousNew York12/6/2019Everyone loved this at thanksgiving! I was hesitant about the sour cream but it was lit. Next year I'm definitely going to make this again and also a regular pumpkin pie just because I can.caesalmemphis, TN12/6/2019This recipe was super simple and I made it the night before Thanksgiving for the first time and it was a hit. Mom said it was the best pumpkin pie she's ever had, so you can't do much better than that!AnonymousBoston, MA12/5/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titPieDessertAmericanPumpkinSquashVegetableGraham CrackerOther IngredientsFallNut-FreeBakingThanksgivingRecipes you want to make.
