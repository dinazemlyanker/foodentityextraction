Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,Healthyish launched over three (!) years ago, just a few days after the presidential inauguration. I worried a lot about bringing a site focused on food and wellness into the world in that political climate. I worried, at the time, about it being relevant or helpful or even interesting. What I\u2019ve learned since then is that everything\u2014recipes, restaurants, food businesses, wellness\u2014is political whether we like it or not. It\u2019s up to us to choose whether and when to acknowledge it explicitly.Sure, sometimes you just want to find a quick stir-fry recipe for a Wednesday night. Or a cookie stuffed with enough nuts and seeds to count as healthyish. Or to laugh about one writer\u2019s absurdist quest to recreate the Impossible Burger while self-quarantined. But other times you gotta talk about it. And I think right now is one of those times.It might be convenient to think that the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, while terrible and tragic, is beyond the scope of a wellness site. I got a letter to that effect this morning, though the sender used some different words that I won\u2019t repeat here. But I have to disagree with the letter-writer because I think a 25-year-old Black man\u2019s killing couldn\u2019t be more relevant, especially right now.As writer Shanika Hillocks wrote in yesterday\u2019s essay, which I hope you\u2019ll read, Arbery was killed while exercising: something we know to be one of the best and easiest ways to protect our health. And he was doing what we\u2019ve been told, again and again, is one of the most accessible and affordable forms of exercise there is: jogging outside. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about that: The very act of trying to preserve his health became the reason he lost his life. And all because two white men saw his body as a threat.If there\u2019s one mission statement that\u2019s guided Healthyish from the start, it\u2019s that wellness should be accessible to everyone. Arbery\u2019s killing is a blunt-force reminder of how far we are from that dream. Want another reminder? Look no further than this global pandemic, which is killing people of color at twice the rate of white people in some parts of the country. The health conditions that put people at high risk of dying from COVID-19\u2014like heart disease, asthma, and diabetes\u2014are the same ones that plague many low-income and Black communities. These, in turn, are caused by systems of racial and economic inequality: mass incarceration, poor healthcare, neighborhood and workplace pollution, lack of healthy food options, and, yes, not enough time, money, or ability to exercise.If you pay attention to wellness, I hope you\u2019ll also pay attention to the lack thereof. Who gets to be well and who doesn\u2019t, and who gets killed for trying. A GoFundMe is raising money to support Arbery\u2019s family, and RaceForward is a national nonprofit working to dismantle barriers to racial justice. As Hillocks writes, \u201cI\u2019m now holding those who consider themselves allies accountable: keep us moving, and keep us alive.\u201dUntil next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish editorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletteressayRead MoreLifestyleI Run For My Health.
