The cookie was fluffy and flavorful, and the buttercream is divine! The salt really makes it. I'm going to use this buttercream for cakes and macarons too! Absolutely a keeper. I made them exactly as written. SarahBaltimore, MD1/20/2022I made these exactly as described, and they looked perfect. The texture of both the cookies and frosting were amazing. BUT I was super disappointed with the flavor of the grapefruit. It was just...off. It tasted grape-fruitlike, and I love grapefruit, but it just did not do it for me in this cookie combination. I would like to try them again and sub pulverized freeze-dried berries for the grapefruit zest. But the structure of these cookies is really excellent.LibbyAtlanta, GA1/19/2022We loved these cookies! I\u2019m not sure why some had the unfortunate experience of no flavor; ours were very flavorful. We are blessed with a yellow grapefruit tree in our front yard, which is what I used here (although I still used red gel in the frosting for the pretty pink color). While the juice from our yellow grapefruits is very bitter, both it and the zest of the fruit is incredibly flavorful\u2014 I love using them for baking! Perhaps try the yellow variety instead of pink if you can find them? Grace SSan Diego, CA1/3/2022I normally am not a huge grapefruit fan but made these to use up some sour cream in the fridge. I love them! I had great grapefruit flavor in mine, not sure why some people had issues. My cookies also didn't spread that much but I don't mind. Lovely!Sarah Saskatoon, SK12/18/2021For those who want the sprinkles: Wilton has a \"Rose Pink Pearl Mix\", that's what seems to be used on the picture.AnonymousPhiladelphia12/17/2021I substituted the grapefruit zest with orange, other than that I followed the recipe exactly  (thank you so much for the weights, it really simplifies the process). They got rave reviews even without the fabulous sprinkles. These are most definitely the closest to the grocery store cookies I have tried. Yummy. The delicious frosting was enough for two batches of the cookies.  I stacked them in a shallow container with parchment paper in between. Julianne Renton Washington 12/14/2021My cookies didn't spread at all.  I think I used a slightly small cookie scoop because I ended up with 31 cookies. I flattened them to 1.5 inches like the recipe said but they are still pretty fat and stubby looking. Otherwise I think the recipe works well. It's definitely a starchy, sweet, soft, cheap texture you might get from the Safeway bakery!StephanieBerkeley, CA12/11/2021Not the best recipe; my cookie tasted more like a scone. Not sure what went wrong, but you got me to try it with that gorgeous photo! On to the next recipe ;)Bree HansonLos Gatos, Ca12/9/2021I'm sorry. I followed the recipe exactly by gram weight even and was disappointed-no grapefruit flavor. I even added extra zest to both cookie and frosting. Don't need to make again. Just a very sweet cookie :( And I'd like instructions on once frosted, how do you stack them to store them?JessieHouston12/5/2021PLEASE reveal the sprinkle source Anonymous12/5/2021Ok, but where did you get those sprinkles???AnonymousBend, OR12/2/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titCookieDessertGrapefruitCitrusFruitEasyAmericanRecipes you want to make.
