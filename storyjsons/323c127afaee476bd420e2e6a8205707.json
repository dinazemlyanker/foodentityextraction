Times have changed. You can actually find great bagels outside of the Big Apple. And that\u2019s because chefs and self-taught bagel obsessives wanted better options in their hometowns and, after intense R&D, they\u2019ve created just that.Case in point: Deanna and Jackie Halcrow of Emerald City Bagels, a new bagel and appetizing shop in Atlanta. After moving around the country, the mother-daughter team landed in Georgia a few years ago. Neither could shake their obsession with the bagels they grew up loving in New York, so they started making their own.Now they\u2019re turning biscuit-loving Atlanta into a bagel destination, and showing the rest of the country that bagels aren\u2019t just a New York thing anymore. Here the Halcrows explain how they got into the bagel business\u2014and why they think more shops are popping up beyond the Big Apple.The bagel dream team at Emerald City Bagels: Jackie (left) and Deanna Halcrow\nPhoto by Emma FishmanWe\u2019re seeing bagels everywhere. Why do you think they\u2019re having a such a moment right now?Jackie: \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it\u2019s become a trend! My mom Deanna started making bagels at home\u2014out of necessity. We couldn\u2019t find bagel shops in Atlanta like we had living in New York. But personally, I think it\u2019s catching on because people are returning to naturally handcrafted food items, like doughnuts. They like to know where their food is coming from.\u201dSo how did Emerald City Bagels start?Deanna: \u201cI made them at home\u2014it took 12 hours for Jackie and me to make a hundred!\u2014and started offering them to my neighbors. I got a lot of feedback, and I realized that bagels were something people [who moved here] missed. That convinced us that something like this was needed, so we started wholesale baking.Did the water question come up?JH: \u201cThis is a passionate subject for us! We get told you can\u2019t make a good bagel without water shipped from New York. First, that\u2019s absurd, but it\u2019s also insulting to us and our bagels that we can\u2019t do what we do well without this one detail. If you\u2019re passionate, you\u2019ll make it really well no matter where your water is from.\u201dHow do you make your bagels?JH: \u201cWe get hard wheat from Michigan, which is milled in Massachusetts, then mixed it with sugar, salt, yeast, malt syrup, starter, and Atlanta tap water. They\u2019re rolled then sit overnight, before they\u2019re boiled in malted water and baked.\u201dI read that your favorite bagels are Absolute Bagels on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side. What makes a great bagel in your opinion?JH: \u201cIt should be dense and chewy with a crusty exterior.\u201dDH: \u201cNot too big\u2014about four ounces. My brother still lives in New York and he sent me an article about how big bagels are getting. Six ounces!\u201dHow\u2019d you end up opening a shop?JH: \u201cThat was the dream. We envisioned the bagel shop of my childhood, with people in t-shirts and more of a deli atmosphere. The idea adapted over the countless hours we spent standing at our table rolling out bagels. It\u2019s taken three years for us to design the shop. It\u2019s weird to put it this way, but we wanted to be Russ & Daughters when we \u2018grew up.\u2019\u201dWhat\u2019s the response been like?DH: \u201cJust the other day, a young guy told us he was so happy to find a bagel shop because he\u2019s from New York. We get that a lot.\u201dJH: \u201cSometimes we get customers who question your New York\u2013ness or want to prove their own. But to have people appreciate your bagels is the best compliment.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titAtlantaRestaurants + TravelRead MorerestaurantsTechnicolor Croissants and More Glimpses Into the Future of PastriesBy Leah MenniescookingMy Biggest Accomplishment of 2018 Was Making My Own GravlaxBy Elaheh NozarirestaurantsThe Best Bagel We Ate in 2017By Julia KramerRecipes you want to make.
