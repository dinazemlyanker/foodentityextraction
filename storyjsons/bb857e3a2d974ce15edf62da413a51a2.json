For a few months, The Cut\u2019s editor in chief traded shots of mini purses and bright-red Valentino Birkenstocks for a whole lot of tortilla content. The inspo? Mexican-Italian chef (and Contramar owner) Gabriela C\u00e1mara\u2019s first cookbook, My Mexico City Kitchen. The 360-plus-pager is a masterpiece of personal storytelling, colorful photography, and all the recipes you could ask for (yes, now you too can make The Tuna Tostada and two-toned grilled snapper). Stella dubbed it the cookbook of the season, and said she\u2019d be practicing her Tortilla Technique \u2122 until she got it right. Many, many iterations later, we got in touch with Stella, who claims she\u2019s \u201cnot a food person\u201d (reader, she\u2019s very much a food person), to find out what about Gabriela\u2019s cookbook had her spending all summer with a fire engine\u2013red tortilla press in hand. \u2014Emily SchultzStella\u2019s summer bible.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigMostly, I keep cookbooks by my bed. I read them and read them and read them without ever feeling like I need to cook from them. I generally treat them more like literature, not as a bunch of recipes to follow. That\u2019s been true of this cookbook from Gabriela C\u00e1mara: I keep looking at it. I keep enjoying it being around me. If I have five minutes, I'll just sit down and flip through it. I love that she shows her home kitchen, and it's really accessible and not fancy. I mean, I love a fancy kitchen, and there are cookbooks that I keep around the house just so I can look at the kitchens in them. But hers has a lived-in quality that I can relate to. And even though her food is excellent, it's pretty down to earth. It\u2019s restaurant food, but it isn\u2019t \u201crestaurant food.\u201d Somehow though, after all summer reading her book, all I really wanted to cook were the tortillas.One of my favorite meals of all time is one that feels very much like what inspired Gabriela to open Contramar in the first place: Tacos, made from fresh tortillas and freshly caught fish. I was 12 years old, on a beach on an island off of Mazatlan in Mexico. My dad and I spent the whole day body surfing and then ordered tacos by the piece from a fisherman and his wife. They were the freshest, most delicious thing. I thought, this is what cooking should be. It was just one of those meals that imprints on your brain.C\u00e1mara in her kitchen.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigAs I was reading Gabriela\u2019s descriptions of learning to make tortillas as a kid (the thing that got her into cooking, at seven years old), I thought, There\u2019s no excuse not to try that. She makes them seem very achievable, like something that you can whip up on a weeknight. So I ordered a bright, shiny, red tortilla press on Amazon and started experimenting.I got a lot of tips\u2014it seems nearly everybody on Instagram has an opinion. No lard. Yes lard. Lots of lard. I tried vegan versions, coconut oil, flax oil. I wasn't really nailing it, but that was a great excuse to just keep messing around. In the end, I went back to the plainest recipe she had in the book. I like my tortillas\u2014Bob\u2019s Red Mill Masa Harina with water and a little bit of oil on a skillet, which you don't really need but I do like the fat. I\u2019m pretty sure my obsession has ruined tortillas for the rest of the people in my life, but I don\u2019t care.Tortillas so good, they\u2019re perfect with butter and anchovy spread.\nGabriela made making fresh tortillas sound like it\u2019s just this easy life improvement. And it is. I love this book for that reason: It's as much about the lifestyle as it is about the food. I like her attitude. Her approach. She started her restaurant to create community and to have experiences that reflected how she felt about the world. I love that.The impetus to have a restaurant to call your own is not that dissimilar from having a magazine in which you're trying to articulate something about the moment you're living in. My favorite cookbooks are the ones that come out of that desire.\u00a0Get the recipe for Contramar\u2019s Red and Green Grilled Snapper:Contramar\u2019s Red and Green Grilled SnapperWe modified Contramar\u2019s whole-fish method with individual fillets, which are easier to handle\u2014but the flavor is the same!View RecipeBuy it: Gabriela C\u00e1mara's \u201cMy Mexico City Kitchen,\u201d $25 on AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
