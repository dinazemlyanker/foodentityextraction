So naturally we wanted to know where the flavor-seeker goes out to eat! Here, he shares restaurants old and new, bakeries and dessert spots, and a plant-filled detour that\u2019s worth the possible traffic jam.Check out more food-focused itineraries from our favorite food people here.Go big with a breakfast sandwich at All Day BabyPhoto Courtesy of All Day BabyA Taiwanese feast at JoyPhoto by Jakob N. LaymanLos AngelesLos Angeles is so huge that it is impossible to tackle in one day. I live north of downtown, which is central to all my favorites. With just a few freeways, you (or your rideshare driver) can navigate from Miracle Mile to San Marino to get to all of them.I\u2019ll start at R\u00e9publique, which has exceptional pastries. There\u2019s lots to choose from, and I love their baguettes and avocado toast, which has sumac and dill\u2014a delightful combination of fresh herbs.Or I\u2019ll head to All Day Baby, a great diner-inspired restaurant where the portions are ridiculously huge. They do a fantastic wedge salad (the dressing is made of labneh!) and hot crab sandwich, which has a smoked jalape\u00f1o mayo that plays so well with the sliced green tomatoes.A beautiful place to walk all that off is on a scenic route through The Huntington in San Marino. In spring, they have a plant sale, which is open to the public.After that, it\u2019s time for lunch, which means a thousand layer pancake at Joy, a casual Taiwanese restaurant. I get it fully loaded\u2014with egg, cheese, chili sauce, and basil\u2014and it also does a delicious Chiayi chicken on rice.For dinner, I\u2019m off to Pardis in Glendale for Persian food. Everything from the rice to the bread and the kabobs is delicious. They even serve you lemon verbena leaf to snack on as a palate cleanser.For dessert, I like to go to Mashti Malone\u2019s, a Persian ice cream shop. The Mashti Special, two wafers sandwiching an ice cream flavor of your choice, is superb, and I fluctuate between a few flavors, including the orange blossom, pistachio, ginger rosewater, and sour cherry rosewater with rice starch noodles sorbet.WHERE TO STAY:The gorgeous Cara Hotel in Los Feliz, which has a pool to cool offWHAT TO BRING BACK:\u00a0Three-cheese semolina loaf from R\u00e9publiqueExplore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsTravelLos AngelesRecipes you want to make.
