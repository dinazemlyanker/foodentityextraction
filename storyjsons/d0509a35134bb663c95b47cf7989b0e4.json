Think again.By Aliza AbarbanelJune 26, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailAs a quietly anxious person who spends a great deal of time thinking about self care\u2014and significantly less time actually practicing it\u2014meditation has long seemed the answer to achieving a healthier mental state. I'm not the only one who feels this way: We're searching for tranquility online, in meditation studios, and in buses parked in Midtown Manhattan. Apps like Headspace and newcomer Calm have raised over $30 million in funding. So, why has every honest attempt to \"clear my mind\" ended with planning that night's dinner?In search of answers (and some stress relief), I called up Jennifer Taylor and Jamie Leigh Kreshock of The Shift, a multifaceted mindfulness app with sound baths, yoga poses, guided meditations, and other tools designed to cultivate awareness in daily life. It turns out, I was wrong about all those failed attempts to \"clear my mind,\" and a lot of other people are too. Here they break down the five myths they hear most\u2014and provide some meditation tips for becoming a more mindful person. I\u2019m officially out of excuses.\u201cI can\u2019t clear my mind\u201dMeditation can take many forms, each with a unique intention, but Taylor notes that mindfulness meditation is not about getting rid of all thoughts. \u201cYour brain is designed to think, and the goal is not to stop the mind but to recognize thoughts without running away from them,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about bringing the mind into a focused point of attention in the present moment.\" If you find yourself planning dinner or wistfully imagining a dreamy vacation in Portugal in the middle of a session, acknowledge that your mind has wandered and bring yourself back to the present (and your meditation practice) by drawing a breath. Also don\u2019t be too hard on yourself. It happens to everyone.\u201cI don\u2019t have enough time to meditate\u201dMost people can\u2019t dedicate an hour a day to mindfulness. And that\u2019s okay! The key is consistency: Taylor stresses that building a daily practice, even for just five minutes, is more effective than meditating for an hour every once in a while. \u201cThere\u2019s no day when you don\u2019t have five minutes when you\u2019re on Instagram or scrolling through something on your computer,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cIt\u2019s basically like your daily hygiene\u2014you brush your teeth and you floss your mind.\u201d Try meditating after waking up or before bed, but don't be afraid to squeeze it in whenever you have a free moment. \u201cPart of my own practice in being compassionate with myself is acknowledging that my schedule looks different,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not a routined person, so the most important thing to me is to find the time in my day somewhere, and sometimes that\u2019s five minutes and sometimes that\u2019s an hour.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been meditating but nothing is happening!\u201d\u201cThe point of meditation is not to have a big experience, and that\u2019s hard for us to wrap our heads around,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cMeditation is really about cultivating a greater sense of intimacy with yourself. It\u2019s about building a relationship where you\u2019re observing the patterns of your own mind.\u201d In other words, you\u2019re probably not going to reach enlightenment. (But if you do, call us!) Just remember that it\u2019s called a meditation practice for a reason\u2014it takes time and practice to feel the effects.\u201cI\u2019m bad at meditating\u201dTime for some real talk: You might never be \u201cgood\u201d at meditating, and that\u2019s okay. \u201cYou can practice every single day and you will have days where you wiggle around like a 4-year-old on your seat because you can\u2019t get it together, and that\u2019s because it\u2019s just life,\u201d says Kreshock. In other words, the struggle is part of the process. (Yes, this is a very zen perspective. But it\u2019s true!) \u201cOne of the things that has been most helpful to me in my own practice has been recognizing that it\u2019s okay to have a full range of emotions,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cIt\u2019s more important for me to sit on my mat for five minutes a day, observe what\u2019s happening in my mind, and just allow it to be what it is without acknowledging whether it\u2019s bad or good.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not the kind of person who can meditate\u201dYou don\u2019t have to chill in salt caves or go to daily yoga classes to make meditation part of your life. You just have to want to start. As a corporate lawyer and co-founder of The Shift, Kreshock uses her own past as a reluctant meditator to prove this point. \u201cThere is powerful data\u2014you don\u2019t have to believe in the esoteric if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d says Kreshock. \u201cMeditation puts our brain in a state of being where we are calmer, our blood pressure is lower, and the pace of our thoughts is more helpful. If for no reason than you don\u2019t want to take your third different kind of blood pressure medication, you should think about where you can put your physical body in a way to achieve better performance.\u201dFor more meditation tips, check out their app.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishTrendsRead MoreLifestyleI Spent an Entire Day on a Meditation Bus and It Was Very, Very QuietBy Rachel Sugar Recipes you want to make.
