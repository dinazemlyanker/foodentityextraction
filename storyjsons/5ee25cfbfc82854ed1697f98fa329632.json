Whether my beer arrives with a froufrou canap\u00e9 or a mess of hacked-up jam\u00f3n, I graciously accept whatever morsel is thrust my way. But I can\u2019t hide my glee when the tapa du jour is my standout favorite, mussels in escabeche spooned over potato chips, their crimson vinegary juices trickling down through the salty crevices.Escabeche is the catchall term for cooked meat or seafood soaked in spiced vinegar. It\u2019s one of the oldest methods of food conservation\u2014and perhaps one of the healthiest, since escabeches rely on acid and spice as opposed to salt or fat. While we have the Romans to thank for Spain\u2019s salt-cured delicacies like jam\u00f3n and anchovies, the Moors likely brought acid-based escabeches to the Iberian Peninsula several centuries later. Escabeches have much in common with ceviches, which rely on citrus juice instead of vinegar: The two share the same Persian root word sikb\u0101g, according to the Washington Post and other sources, so this connection makes sense considering that the Spanish may have brought this particular use of vinegar to Peru during colonization.I missed this humble dish so much during Spain\u2019s tapas-less quarantine that I set about re-creating it from scratch. And along the way I realized just how versatile the garlic-and-paprika-marinated mollusks could be, whether piled into a baguette, spooned over stewed legumes, or tossed with chilled bowties and fresh herbs for a bright, oceany pasta salad. You can find mussels in escabeche in tins, but making them at home allows for maximum freshness, customization, and affordability. (Canned mussels can set you back more than $23 a pop, while fresh ones rarely exceed $3 a pound.) Luckily, my friend Pablo's abuela had an old recipe tucked away. I tinkered with her formula until it transported me back to the barstool of my still-closed neighborhood bar. Here\u2019s where I netted out.Start with 4 pounds fresh mussels, which will make roughly 8 appetizer-size portions (or a few hearty solo dinners) . Any variety will do, but the cultivated ones have less grit and are sustainable to boot. Scrub the shells with the rough side of a sponge to remove any sand and seaweed (don\u2019t worry if some barnacles remain), and put them in a large pot with a lid. Pour in 1 cup dry white wine, such as Spanish albari\u00f1o, cover the pot, and steam over high heat until the mussels open, 5\u201310 minutes. Use tongs to place them in a bowl, reserving the liquid. When cool enough to handle, take the mussels out of the shells with your fingers, discarding the shells and any mussels that haven\u2019t opened. Snip out the seaweed \u201cbeards\u201d from each mollusk with scissors and discard. Strain the juices in the pot through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl or 4-cup measuring cup.For the marinade, set a skillet over medium heat and add \u00bd cup extra virgin olive oil, 1 large onion, finely chopped, 4 dried bay leaves, 2 cloves, 8 peppercorns, and 8 garlic cloves, unpeeled and lightly smashed with the back of a knife. Fry until the onion is soft and the cloves are golden at the edges, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat for five minutes, then add 2 tsp. smoked Spanish paprika (a.k.a. piment\u00f3n), \u00bd cup white wine vinegar, 1 Tbsp. table salt (or 2 Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal kosher salt), and 1\u00bd cups of the reserved juices, and stir it all together (the mixture will remain somewhat separated).Place the mussels in a jar or bowl and pour the liquid on top. Seal the container tightly and refrigerate the mussels for at least 24 hours before serving. They will absorb more flavor over time and keep for up to 10 days, although mussels in escab\u00e8che never last that long in my house\u2014especially when there are potato chips in the cupboard and beers in the fridge. I\u2019m doubling my next batch for holiday charcuterie boards and impromptu hangouts with my pod. There\u2019s something undeniably festive about toothpick food\u2014and devilishly satisfying about spooning leftovers, marinade and all, onto crusty European bread to eat alone.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishRead Morecooking73 Healthy Soup Recipes That Make Any Day CozierGallery73 SlidesBy The Healthyish TeamRecipes you want to make.
