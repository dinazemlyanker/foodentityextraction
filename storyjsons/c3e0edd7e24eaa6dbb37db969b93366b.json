It smokes and it smells and anyone who comes into your kitchen is practically obligated to ask if you\u2019re aware that something is, ahem, on fire. If you\u2019re unlucky (and, like me, hesitant-slash-unwilling to clean the dinky oven in your rental apartment), it festers: You\u2019ll wonder what\u2019s burning the next few times you turn on the oven to roast vegetables or salmon. You\u2019ll fear for your health and the health of your cats.But while the problem is pesky, the solution is almost unspeakably easy: Bake cake on a sheet pan. The rimmed pan will catch the drips before they waterfall into the bowels of your oven, meaning they\u2019re less likely to smolder and stink. If they are burning to the point of bothering you, take the sheet pan out, scrape the bubbled-over bits into the sink, and continue on your merry way. I usually line the pan with old parchment paper that I\u2019m trying to reuse or a Silicone baking mat to make clean-up even lazier. In the end, there\u2019s no mess on the bottom of your oven and if you tell no one, you might forget it overflowed in the first place.I bake all of my cakes on sheet trays, especially loaves, Bundts, and anything made in a springform pan (the seal between the belt and the bottom is often not so secure) or a tart pan with a removable bottom. Just last weekend, the tart I was baking leaked butter everywhere. And I\u2019ve learned the hard way that pies, especially fruit pies that have the propensity to burble and spat, need a sheet tray to catch what cannot otherwise be contained. Baking on a sheet tray also feels safer: I\u2019m way more likely to get a good grip on a rimmed tray with oven mitts or a kitchen towel than I am a hot pie dish or a very full loaf pan.Of course, there are other ways to prevent overflowing cake. Use the size pan called for in the recipe and hold back a bit of batter (start with \u00bd cup) if you\u2019re reaching the tippy-top. But consider the sheet-tray-under-the-pan trick like insurance: Even if it\u2019s not necessary, at least it\u2019s nice to know it\u2019s there.Try it now:Earl Grey Yogurt CakeA tea cake that's true to its name, this loaf harnesses the power of citrusy Earl Grey tea for its distinct flavor. Lemon poppyseed can't hold a candle.\u00a0View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasically BakingCakeRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
