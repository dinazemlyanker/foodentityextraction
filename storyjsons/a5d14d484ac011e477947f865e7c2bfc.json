Feel free to get creative by swapping in different nuts and dried fruits for the almonds and dates. Reynoso likes this salad with a side of torn baguette or sourdough rolls for making little open-face sandwiches.Ingredients4 Servings3Tbsp. raw skin-on almonds4skinless, boneless chicken thighs (about 1\u00bc lb.)Kosher salt2large bunches Swiss chard, preferably rainbow (about 1 lb.)1large shallot, thinly sliced1tsp. finely grated lemon zest2Tbsp. fresh lemon juice1Tbsp. white wine vinegar\u00bdtsp. cumin seeds, crushed5Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more for drizzling6Medjool dates, pitted, coarsely chopped\u2153cup kalamata olives, pitted, coarsely choppedPreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 350\u00b0.
