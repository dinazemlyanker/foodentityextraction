He\u2019s not a celebrated chef (outside of his social circle anyway), he\u2019s never written down a single recipe (\u201cThey\u2019re all in my head,\u201d he says), and he doesn\u2019t care all that much about the latest cooking gadgets (he\u2019s been using the same stuff since my childhood). But I can picture how he moves around the kitchen, throwing a towel over his shoulder and reaching into the spice cabinet for what he calls \u201ca little of this and a little of that.\u201d And for as long as I can remember, he always reaches for a bottle of Pickapeppa sauce.My dad is from Kingston, Jamaica, which is not too far from where Pickapeppa was invented in an area called Shooter\u2019s Hill. As the story goes, a teenager named Norman Nash developed it in his own family\u2019s kitchen as a hobby in 1921 and used a formula that\u2019s now so coveted that the details are hidden away in a bank vault. Cane vinegar made in-house, West Indian red peppers, sugar, onions, raisins, and mango concentrate are just a few of the known ingredients, which are simmered down together in copper pots then aged in oak barrels in the same place where Norman first got the big idea.Although there are copycats out there, and the company has expanded to include more flavors, the traditional Pickapeppa is the only one that really matters to my dad. It has the thickness of ketchup, the color of rich soil, and the sort of mild tang that helped his three American kids develop a palette beyond chicken nuggets and French fries. To open a bottle is to get an immediate perfume of cane vinegar and cloves, followed by a bit of onion and a hint of thyme. Its acidity comes through first, like a gentle burn at the back of the throat, then the spices kick in for a layered finish without any heat. It\u2019s tough to determine the sea salt from the garlic or the mango concentrate from the tomato paste. But together, they make something that\u2019s casual yet complex. Kinda like my dad.My family stirs it into soups\u2014especially a turkey-based one my dad makes with sausage, thick noodles, and flour dumplings for the day after Thanksgiving\u2014and plops it on top of meats like a familiar condiment. It makes regular appearances in marinades for steaks, barbecue sauces for ribs, and as a topping for burgers (Pickapeppa is known as the Jamaican A1, of course). \u201cI put Pickapeppa sauce on everything,\u201d my dad told me. \u201cEverything! Well, okay, not on fish.\u201dI\u2019ve often wondered why Pickapeppa can be so ubiquitous but still remain relatively under the radar. Its flavor is much more mild than the island\u2019s famed jerk chicken, it can be bought in bulk on Amazon, and it\u2019s in markets from North America to Australia. Sometimes I hope it\u2019ll rise to the popularity of Sriracha or be given the permanent respect of Worcestershire, and that restaurant chefs and home cooks alike will make just a little more room for it in their kitchens. But, for now, as I pour Pickapeppa onto my sandwich for lunch and see its green and orange label with the parrot in the center and Jamaican flag on the side, it\u2019s a proud emblem of my heritage, the open secret to why my dad\u2019s food tastes so good.Buy Pickapeppa sauce for $8 on AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com and Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
