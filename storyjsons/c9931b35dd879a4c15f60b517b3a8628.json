During the days leading up to the holiday, my dad, Frank Lalli, stations himself in front of the kitchen TV, paring knife in hand and pints of Brussels sprouts arranged around him, to begin what is known in my family as \u201cThe Brussels Prep.\u201dThis painstaking process involves coring each tiny little cabbage and then separating the leaves so that they can be stir-fried over high heat in the minutes leading up to the Thanksgiving meal. Before that can happen, every leaf must be liberated from the rest, and it has to be done right. This drudgery is supposedly alleviated by a good college game, or at least that\u2019s the theory. If Frank gets lazy or impatient and starts pulling the leaves off in clumps, or with pieces of the root attached, he will incur the loving wrath of one of the Lalli sisters (that would be me and my sister, Nina). We like our leaves fluffy. Because this laborious prep can be done days in advance, there\u2019s at least some amount of balance to the whole affair. Yes, it\u2019s a lot of vegetable butchery. But! It\u2019s easy. And! You can do it on the Monday before T-Day. Plus! The dish itself takes minutes to prepare.The more hands to help, the merrier.\nPhoto by Michael GraydonI can\u2019t remember when the Brussels first made an appearance on the menu. They\u2019ve never not been there. Memories of all the years of making them have blurred together, a slo-mo flashback montage of Thanksgivings that took place in the kitchen of the house I grew up in, and the one my parents have lived in for the past 20 years, along with the cast-iron skillets that have been residents of both. The only thing that\u2019s changed is the addition of some lemon zest and some lemon juice\u2014a modern intervention on the classic presentation, and a move we might debate this year.No matter how many pints Frank works his way through, there\u2019s always just enough Brussels to go around the table once, bright green and crisp-tender, perfectly blistered and charred spots. Their preciousness\u2014alongside an abundance of every other dish on the table\u2014makes us covet them even more.Get the recipe:Stir-Fried Brussels SproutsWith this brussels sprouts recipe, get straight to the good stuff: those sweet, bright green, tender-crisp leaves.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titbrussels sproutEntertainingThanksgivingWalnutCooking Without RecipesRecipes you want to make.
