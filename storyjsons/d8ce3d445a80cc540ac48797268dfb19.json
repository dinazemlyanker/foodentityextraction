Seems like a small difference, right? Maybe one you wouldn\u2019t even notice at the grocery store, in the glaring lights of the spice aisle? Welp, read carefully, friends: Because that last letter is an important distinguisher of two different ingredients.Let\u2019s start with chile powder, which is made from ground dried chiles, with few or no additives. There are many types of chile powder, all named after their pepper of origin. Ancho chile powder, the kind Molly Baz recommends for her No-Grill Elote is made from, uh, ancho chiles (a.k.a. dried poblanos) and is fruity, earthy, and relatively mild. Because it\u2019s smoky, it\u2019s helpful for creating the illusion of grilling even when no grill is involved (as in the aforementioned elote).Chipotle chile powder, which comes from dried and smoked jalape\u00f1os, has a similar rich charred flavor but more intense heat. Cayenne, which starts from\u2014you guessed it\u2014dried cayenne peppers, is the the most fiery and least smoky of the three and is often used in small quantities (because, very fiery). While those three are the most common chile powders in the US, there are so many available for mail-order that you could make a hobby of collecting harder-to-source varieties\u2014like habanero, guajillo, piri piri, Kashmiri chile, Bird\u2019s Eye. But before you clear out a drawer exclusively for chile powders, remember that, like all ground spices, they lose potency as they sit.Now onto chili powder, which is used to flavor the dish of the same name (you know, like Chicken Chorizo Chili). In the BA recipe style guide, a 16-page document expertly maintained by our recipe editor Liesel Davis, chili is said to refer to \u201cchili con carne and the seasoning used in making it.\u201d Chili powder contains other ingredients like oregano, paprika, pepper, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, and/or salt. You\u2019ll have to read the ingredient list to see exactly what the jar contains, as the exact blend varies between brands.Deputy Food Editor Chris Morocco is a big fan of high-quality chili powder because when he wants dried, ground chiles, he\u2019s most often craving the other spices and dried herbs that\u2019ll make it multidimensional rather than one-note. Plus, it\u2019s more of a one-stop shop, delivery complex flavor with only one jar. He uses chili powder in dry rubs, to spice up his Easiest-Ever Grilled Veggie Burgers, and to finish buttery seared mushrooms. His advice? Find a blend that doesn\u2019t contain salt so that you\u2019re still able to season the dish to taste.In conclusion, both chili powder and chile powder have their uses, but they\u2019re not the same. So before you go adding 2 teaspoons of cayenne to your chili (...ouch!), make sure that\u2019s an \u201ci\u201d and not an \u201ce\u201d on the jar, okay?First chile powder, then elote:No-Grill EloteEverything you love about Mexican elote\u2014the charred kernels, the creamy-spicy-salty sauce, lots of lime\u2014without the grill.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titChileAncho ChileChiliChile PowderRecipes you want to make.
