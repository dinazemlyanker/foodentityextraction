In the summer, an afternoon at Rockaway Beach in Queens distracts me from the fact that I spend the majority of the season sweating on the subway platform. And in the fall, going upstate to Storm King in Cornwall, New York, is a necessary reminder of what fresh air is. But my favorite, any-season day trip in NYC is to Mitsuwa, a Japanese grocery store in New Jersey.Living in NYC isn't so hard when Mitsuwa (and its incredibly crispy tempura) is just a bus ride away.\nThe small chain of supermarkets (there are 11 total across the United States) feature both a food court and a grocery store\u2014a rare but crucial double whammy that makes the hour-long bus ride from Port Authority to Edgewater, NJ, worth it. The move when you get to Mitsuwa is to take a lap around the food court to scope out the 15 or so restaurant stalls, order lots of different bites, and then browse/shop the aisles of the supermarket while you digest. Here\u2019s a list of some of my favorite things to eat and buy there.Shatteringly crispy strips of pork katsu from Wateishoku KanedaShrimp tempura with sweet soy dipping sauce from Tendon HannosukeOnion-y fish cakes from Amo-ChinmiMiso ramen with a handful of scallions from worth-the-wait Santouka RamenDried shiitake mushrooms, umeboshi, yuzu gummy candies, onigiri, and all the pickles from the supermarketLiterally anything else that looks good to youSo while my trips to the Rockaways or upstate New York serve their purpose certain times of the year, the joy of a huge supermarket in suburbia filled with all my favorite foods is forever.Go there: MitsuwaExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendGroceryNew JerseyJapaneseRecipes you want to make.
