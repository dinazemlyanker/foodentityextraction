Prized for its versatility, pone is a Caribbean staple typically made with grated yuca (cassava) and can be either sweet or savory. In this version grated sweet potatoes replace the yuca and mingle with a triple coconut threat (oil, flakes, and milk), plus a dynamic mix of aromatics from rum to citrus and warm spices. The result is a dessert capable of dethroning even the most beloved of holiday desserts, especially when served with a scoop of good vanilla ice cream. While a traditional yuca pone is denser and often served in cake-like slices, this one is more scoopable, almost like a pudding. Finely grating the sweet potatoes by hand does require some elbow grease, but the results make it well worth it. \u2014Brigid WashingtonAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I was mostly excited for the rum and bitters flavors, but all I ended up tasting was orange from all the zest. Maybe this is how it\u2019s supposed to be, but the texture just wasn\u2019t my jam either - slightly crunchy sweet potatoes. Maybe if the batter had been more wet, the sweet potatoes would have steamed/cooked more. It wasn\u2019t overly sweet, which was nice, just too much orange for me. JoshMilwaukee1/29/2022Haven't made this yet, but it sound like it might be similar to Bibinka, which I love.
