However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Is a kitchen really a kitchen if it doesn\u2019t have a sheet pan (or five)? Metal baking trays are our workhorses, handling everything from cookies to roasted vegetables to entire sheet-pan dinners. Sure, you might think a bit of metal is just a bit of metal. How different can sheet pans be? But not all are created equal, and for a piece of kitchen equipment as vital as a baking tray, you\u2019ll want to make sure you\u2019re getting one that will serve you well and last for years.Our platonic sheet pan is no wallflower. We need it to be durable enough to use daily without warping under high heat, high-quality so that your food cooks exactly at the rate it should, and the right size to fit in most home ovens. For all that and more, we turn to the inimitable Nordic Ware Naturals Aluminum Half-Sheet. It\u2019s the best sheet pan on the market\u2014and the BA Test Kitchen\u2019s agreed upon, all-time favorite.Nordic Ware Half-Sheet Pan$19.50 at Bon App\u00e9tit MarketWhy is the Nordic Ware Naturals Aluminum Half-Sheet our pick for best sheet pan?Our crowd-favorite baking sheet is made with high-quality, pure, uncoated aluminum, which conducts heat more efficiently and uniformly than aluminized steel (aluminum-coated steel) or stainless steel. This results in food that bakes evenly, rises predictably, and browns perfectly\u2014meaning, when you put a tray of choc-chip cookies in the oven, they start baking straightaway on your aluminum sheet pan and stop baking as soon as you pull them out. Nobody likes a burnt-bottom biscuit! Conductivity is king!Made from heavy-gauge (read: thick) aluminum, these sheets are also our pick for durability. Metal expands when heated, and under extreme temperatures a thin, rimless baking sheet might turn into something that looks more at home in a sculpture garden than your kitchen. Something called a \u201creinforced encapsulated steel rim\u201d is the secret weapon to making Nordic Ware\u2019s baking trays virtually un-warpable. The edge of the aluminum tray is rolled around a rectangular frame of steel wire, which pushes against the four sides and keeps the bottom flat, making sure your pan stays level and absorbs heat evenly.This half-sheet is also mess-free! The one-inch high edge, like a dam levee, keeps olive oil from sloshing everywhere, sheet-pan dinner juices from spilling, rising dough from expanding off the edge, and crispy little veggie bits from ending up in bottom-of-the-oven purgatory. All of which makes for an easier cleanup later.The coziest little butternuts\nPhoto by Alex LauSo, what size pan should I buy? What is the difference between a sheet pan and a jelly roll pan and a cookie sheet? Help, I\u2019m spiraling.Okay, so when it comes to sheet pans, size matters. Typically, we recommend a half-sheet pan, which is about 18x13\" and is big enough for most home cooks but small enough to fit easily into your apartment oven. Unless you are a commercial baker, when you read a recipe that calls for a sheet pan, this is the size in question.Nordic Ware Half-Sheet Pan$19.50 at Bon App\u00e9tit MarketFull sheet pans, the ones you see used in restaurant kitchens and commercial bakeries, are actually ginormous (26x18\") and won\u2019t fit in most home kitchen ovens. But if you need to cook for a crowd, the Nordic Ware Big Sheet Baking Pan, at 21x15\", is your fighter. It\u2019s 35% larger than the classic half-sheet pan and still fits most standard-size ovens. Made from aluminum, it\u2019s a trusty pan that you can count on for the long haul.Nordic Ware Big Sheet Baking Pan$25 at Bon App\u00e9tit MarketQuarter-sheet pans also exist. At 13x9\", their surface area is half the size of a half-sheet pan\u2019s, naturally, and they\u2019re great for when you\u2019re roasting a portion of small portion of veg, toasting nuts or seeds, baking a \u201cI\u2019m having a hard day\u201d cookie for one, or storing meat in the fridge. For a small but mighty tray, don\u2019t look past the Nordic Ware Bakers Quarter-Sheet Pans. They\u2019re staples in restaurant kitchens and virtually guaranteed to make you a better, faster cook.Photo by Alex LauNordic Ware Quarter-Sheet Pans, 2-Pack$26 at Amazon$34 at Food52While cookie sheets are often referred to as baking sheets, there is a difference. At best, they have one or two slightly raised edges\u2014like this Vollrath Wear-Ever Cookie Sheet Pan\u2014but typically they are totally flat. This feat of design excellence allows hot cookies to slide off the tray easily without ruining their shape. But never, ever roast on these! They\u2019re more susceptible to warping and your meat juices and oils will be very everywhere.Vollrath Wear-Ever Cookie Sheet Pan$26 at AmazonFor the pastry chefs among us: A jelly roll pan is another thing altogether. At 15x10\" in size, a jelly roll pan is larger than a quarter-sheet pan and smaller than a half-sheet pan. If you make a lot of roulades, go ahead and buy one rather than trying to scale up or down your recipes. Sure, they make for dainty spirals of sponge cake, but they\u2019re also a great size for baking just about anything.Photo by Laura Murray, Food Styling by Pearl JonesNordic Ware Jelly Roll Pan$16 at Amazon$18 at NordicwareHow do I care for my sweet little sheets?Even without a nonstick surface (or an added nonstick coating), cleaning your sheet pans is easy, especially when you line them with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat prior to cooking. Before the initial use and after every use following, hand-wash your baking sheet with warm, soapy water. Aluminum cookware and bakeware reacts with acidic foods\u2014like tomatoes and citrus\u2014which can cause discoloration, darkening, corrosion, and pitting. It\u2019s totally cosmetic and harmless, but if you roasted tomatoes and don\u2019t like your new splotches, follow this more fastidious guide to cleaning sheet pans and they\u2019ll be spiffy in no time. (Note: Using a dishwasher isn\u2019t recommended; hand-washing is best.)Take good care of your sheet pans and they'll take good care of you.\nPhoto by Alex LauOkay that all makes sense\u2026but what should I cook?The world, my friend, is your roasted oyster mushrooms (with polenta and thyme). Make a huge batch of the world\u2019s easiest focaccia bread, then snack on it all week. Crack a bev and bake some hot honey wings! Roll out some crisp-yet-tender sugar cookies to remind yourself that there are still good things in this cursed world. Turn to any one of these 30 sheet-pan recipes for easy weeknight dinners that are even easier on the cleanup crew. One piece of kitchen equipment that does all this and more? That\u2019s so metal.Oh sheet:Chipotle-Rubbed Chicken Sheet-Pan DinnerSweet-spicy chipotle chicken, zippy roasted tomatillo salsa, and spice-rubbed squash all on one sheet pan.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titToolsBA RecommendsShoppingRecipes you want to make.
