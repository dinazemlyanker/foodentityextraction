For Starters, PerfectLike chewy little clouds, these Japanese sweet rice cakes are all about texture.By Antara SinhaDecember 13, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhotograph by Isa Zapata. \u00a0Food Styling by Micah Morton. \u00a0Prop Styling by Paige HicksFacebookTwitterEmailAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

In Japan, where mochi originated, they\u2019re typically enjoyed around the New Year. Though, if you\u2019re me, you\u2019ll house them literally anytime. Made from pounded and molded rice dough, these sweet little rice cake confections come in a variety of colors and flavors (like matcha, chocolate, and strawberry) and have a slightly sticky, delightfully chewy quality about them\u2014like stretchy little clouds.Endlessly versatile, mochi take on many forms: Stuffed mochi treats, called daifuku, have sweet fillings, such as anko (a sweet red bean paste made from azuki beans). Vivid green kusa mochi are made with Japanese mugwort (a close cousin to the stuff that gives absinthe its color) that\u2019s kneaded into the dough. Shelf-stable dried mochi, called kiri mochi, can often be found in Asian grocery stores and enjoyed by grilling, boiling, or toasting until golden brown on the outside and gooey on the inside. Sakura mochi, also filled with anko and traditionally eaten in the spring, are mochi that have been dyed pink and wrapped in a pickled cherry blossom leaf. Butter mochi is a popular baked Hawaiian cake, made with the same rice flour, condensed milk, and coconut milk. And the mochi you\u2019ve probably seen in big name U.S. supermarkets: pastel and ice cream-stuffed.As for the mochi most commonly found in my house? It\u2019s these peanut-stuffed, coconut rolled beauties from recipe developer Kristina Cho\u2019s recently published cookbook, Mooncakes and Milk Bread. As she perfectly summarizes in the headnote, \u201cI could eat these snowball-like confections by the handful.\u201dMooncakes and Milk Bread$30 $27 at Amazon$30 $28 at Bookshop.orgSo, how do you make mochi?Traditionally, mochi is made by pounding steamed short-grain Japanese sticky rice, called mochigome, with a wooden mallet during a ceremony called mochitsuki. This aerates and pulverizes the rice, which is what gives mochi its beloved texture. This process, however, is time- and labor-intensive\u2014there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s typically an annual occasion that friends and family attend to help out.For a speedier stovetop method that\u2019s perfect for making mochi year-round, I turn to mochiko: glutinous rice flour milled from that sweet mochigome rice. And don\u2019t be thrown by the word glutinous. It refers to that stretchy, chewy texture that makes mochi treats so craveable and not to gluten itself (mochiko is naturally gluten-free; just double-check before buying in case it\u2019s processed alongside products containing gluten). As for the best mochiko rice flour, Cho prefers Koda Farms, \u201cbecause it delivers the best and most consistent results,\u201d she writes in Mooncakes and Milk Bread.Mochiko Sweet Rice Flour$9 at AmazonIn Cho\u2019s mochi recipe, she calls for cooking mochiko, sugar, and coconut milk (a nontraditional but truly delightful addition) together on the stove until it pulls away from the sides of the pan and becomes doughy and pliable.\" To make cleanup a breeze, you\u2019ll want to opt for a nonstick saucepan. And when you\u2019re turning out the dough to roll into balls and stuff with their filling, Cho explains that \u201ca silicone baking mat is helpful...because the mochi dough tends to be really sticky.\u201d You\u2019ll also want to keep plenty of cornstarch (or potato starch) nearby for dusting your hands, which makes shaping the mochi easier. After they\u2019re stuffed, they\u2019re ready to eat.Once you learn how to make the dough, the world is your mochi. Fill them with fruit, ice cream, or chocolate ganache. Coat the outside with sugar and soybean powder. Fry pieces of the plain dough, wrap them in seaweed, and dunk them in soy sauce. But whatever you do, remember: Mochi doesn\u2019t hold its signature texture for long and won\u2019t last beyond a couple days in the fridge without drying out. You\u2019ll want to tightly wrap your prepared mochi treats individually and freeze them to preserve the dough\u2019s stretchiness. Or, a suggestion that presents no issues, eat them immediately!Wait, what\u2019s the difference between mochi and dango?Some say that using rice flour like mochiko, instead of pounded steamed rice, technically makes these treats dango not mochi. Dango, another Japanese sweet treat, is made with a rice flour dough\u2014but traditionally, not one that uses mochiko. Instead of the glutinous rice flour made from mochigome, dango is usually made from a different short grain rice called uruchi\u2014though some cooks, chefs, and manufacturers may use a blend of mochiko and uruchi, or only mochiko, as it\u2019s often more readily available (see why the classifications get sticky?).You\u2019re likely to see dango, which aren\u2019t usually stuffed, served as hand-rolled balls, often skewered like a kebab, and topped with a syrupy, savory-sweet glaze. Both mochi and dango fall under the tasty category of wagashi, Japanese desserts and sweets that are enjoyed at tea time. And both are truly perfect.It\u2019s mochi time:Coconut-Peanut Mochi BallsMochi that\u2019s this soft and chewy (the key is coconut milk!) is practically begging to be paired with a delightfully crunchy peanut filling.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingDessertJapaneseRecipes you want to make.
