This time, we all took home a recipe from our dear friend and colleague Priya Krishna\u2019s new cookbook, Indian-ish, and set up the next day in the Test Kitchen to share our dishes, potluck-style, for lunch.And let me tell you, there was a lot of delicious Indian-ish recipes (Priya\u2019s name for the dishes that her Indian mother, Ritu, would make\u2014and make up\u2014in their American home of Dallas, TX) to try. Restaurant editor Elyse Inamine brought a vegetarian main: the addictively crunchy lotus root with sweet jammy tomatoes. They were perfect for scooping onto the pleasingly oily and slightly spicy paratha I made (I\u2019m trying to brand myself into the flatbread girl). Assistant editor Aliza Abarbanel made the Sabudana\u2014a peanut-lime tapioca dish, which had the consistency of mochi and was surprisingly savory! She served it with Aloo Bhujia, these crispy-crunchy fried potato noodles that are like a skinnier version of those fried wonton strips that come with Chinese takeout.But the unanimous crowd-pleaser of the day was the chile peanut rice that food editor Molly Baz made. Did we expect to be infatuated with a rice dish? No. But the minute we scooped our first bites into our salivating mouths, we fell in love. Christina Chaey politely asked for seconds. \u201cWHY IS THIS SO GOOD?!\u201d scream-asked Rachel Karten. \u201cIt tastes like MF buttered popcorn!\u201d shouted Molly as she walked us through the dish, which uses leftover rice, earthy fried mustard seeds and curry leaves, almost-caramelized onions for a touch of sweetness, crunchy-toasty peanuts, and Indian green chile for some heat.Site Director Carey Polis and I ate these by the fistful.\nPhotograph by Chelsie Craig\u201cIt\u2019s crazy to see you guys freak out over the recipes we cooked on a random Wednesday,'\u201d Priya said, as she watched us all shovel more servings directly into our gaping maws.As we cleaned up, we agreed that we would definitely be making many of the book\u2019s recipes part of our random Wednesdays too. They\u2019re approachable, effortlessly vegetarian, perfect for lunch (no midday naps necessary!), and epic enough for the most colorful dinner party spread you could imagine.We didn't forget about dessert! Priya brought Shrikhand\u2013a strained yogurt with saffron and cardamom.\nPhotograph by Chelsie CraigSo make this chile peanut rice, whatever else that calls your name, and tag #BACookbookClub so we can see what you\u2019ve made.Get the recipe:Chile Peanut RiceLeftover basmati rice gets gussied up with earthy fried mustard seeds and curry leaves, sweet caramelized, crunchy peanuts, and spicy chiles.View RecipeBuy It: Priya Krishna\u2019s Indian-ish, $17 on amazon.comAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
