Yes, it\u2019s worth the wait.ORDER THE: udon, of course. You can\u2019t go wrong with really any of them\u2014as intensely as the noodle cooks are about rolling out and chopping the thick stands to order, they\u2019re equally intense about the soup they pair the noodles with. But our favorites are the simple ones, like hot kake with pops of fried tempura dots and sea urchin cream.THE VIBE IS: efficient. There\u2019s not much ambiance\u2014dark wood chairs, dark brown leather booths, yellowish lighting\u2014but you don\u2019t really mind when you\u2019re slurping as much of those heavenly noodles as you possibly can. The staff is quick to get your order in (and you out) since there\u2019s a constant line out the door, but they\u2019re attentive and easy to flag down.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day: Monday to Friday, 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 5 p.m. to 10 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday, 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m.\u2014Elyse InamineRen FullerWE ALSO LOVENight + MarketThai street food, Sunset Boulevard-styleJitladaDefinitely the best Thai food in L.A., and likely the whole countryRiceBarEverything\u2019s coming up rice bowls in downtown L.A.Explore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
