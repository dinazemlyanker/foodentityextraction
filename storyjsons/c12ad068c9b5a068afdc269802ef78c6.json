Have a question? Email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.Is it ever okay to give someone a Brita pitcher for Valentine\u2019s Day? Doesn\u2019t offering someone the gift of pure water mean you care? \u2014Filtered FabioIt\u2019s one thing if you filled the pitcher with ros\u00e9 or aromatherapy massage oil as part of a grand scheme. But water-water? Uh, no. No way. That\u2019s more of a random Wednesday gift (which honestly, we\u2019re not doing enough of). The best food gift on Valentine\u2019s Day is a meal you make yourself (see menu below). Or a bucket of Maldon salt with a ring box nested inside.Illustration by Cari Vander YachtIs it more romantic to eat at a restaurant or cook at home? \u2014Comparative ClariceMost restaurant Valentine\u2019s Day dinners are a chaotic, corny disaster. Everyone\u2019s so caught up in the fact that it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day\u2014is that a Tony Bennett impersonator playing the Casio in the corner?\u2014that you barely have time to make googly eyes with your sweetie. Whereas you can dine naked if you cook at home. I\u2019d say a restaurant is more romantic than on the couch, but only by a crumb. A list of the most romantic places to eat on Valentine\u2019s Day, in descending order:-Eating BYO pizza at your favorite dive-At the bar of a fancy restaurant (NOT table)-At home on the couch watching John Wick-In a booth at a well-worn diner at 3 p.m.-Taco Bell Cantina (the one with wine)-The dining car on an Amtrak train-Your mom\u2019s houseWhat\u2019s the most risk-free and relatively easy but impressive Valentine's Day dinner you can make? \u2014Meek MarvinAppetizer: Old Amsterdam gouda, Mary\u2019s Gone Crackers original flavorMain: Lamb meatballsSides: Roasted honeynut squash halves with brown butter and a ton of flaky salt, a simple saladDessert: McConnell\u2019s mint chip ice cream (better than any mouthwash)Illustration by Cari Vander YachtAre aphrodisiacs real??? Are people eating oysters and bird nest\u2019s soup and just going AT IT? Or is it a placebo effect? \u2014Hot-and-bothered HortenseIllustrious sex therapist Dr. Ruth says no and I don\u2019t take sex advice from anyone a day under 90.My spouse doesn\u2019t like dealing with shells or cutting around bones when he eats, but I think it\u2019s time to be an adult. What message does linguine with clams and a roast chicken send? \u2014Communicative ColbyThe message you\u2019re sending: \u201cI used to think all of the quirky picky things about you were charming and special. Now I see you as you truly are, which is irrational, childish, and high-maintenance. A divorce is too much paperwork, so let\u2019s just be petty and mean to each other for the next 37 years. I will never pick up your stewn-aside socks.\u201d Is that what you wanted to hear???? Make soup, Colby. Make soup.Illustration by Cari Vander YachtIs it ever okay to pretend to get engaged at a restaurant for the free dessert or is that begging for bad karma? \u2014Fatalistic FatimaIf you believe that marriage is a societal construct to blackmail you for health insurance, then the whole act is performance art and I can\u2019t not respect that. If you\u2019re merely hungry, buy the damn cheesecake yourself!What do you do if the restaurant tries to put you at the communal table? \u2014Standoffish SorayaIntroduce yourself to everyone individually, giving your name and a fun fact about yourself. Assume the food is also communal and keep asking strangers to \u201cpass the steak.\u201d Stand up and say grace. Tell the waiter your \u201cfriend over there\u201d is taking care of the bill. Or, I dunno, deal with it? No one\u2019s asking you over for an orgy, unless of course, they are. You never know with the communal table.Illustration by Cari Vander YachtWhat\u2019s the cutest food to eat on a date? The Olsen twins once said grapes are the ultimate cute food. \u2014Adorable AdrianWow, way to quote So Little Time! The following foods are cute enough to eat on a date:-Mandarin oranges\n-Mickey Mouse pancakes\n-Chocolate-dipped strawberries from the sad person in the Godiva window\n-Sliders\n-Whole fish with the head on, awwww\n-Sure, grapesWe\u2019ve been dating for three weeks. What are my Valentine\u2019s Day obligations? \u2014Non-committal NaomiAre you into it? Are they into it? If so, order takeout (rhymes with \u201cmake out\u201d for a reason), and don\u2019t talk about whether you\u2019re exclusive or still married or wearing socks. You\u2019re in the having-fun stage, so have fun! If you can\u2019t tell if they\u2019re into it, that\u2019s too much pressure for me to handle. Make a plan for February 16 instead and go bowling and eat curly fries. Let love springeth forth on its own timeline.Are Turtles chocolates still the very best Valentine's Day candy ever? \u2014Hyperbolic JavierHere\u2019s my answer, in the form of a handy diagram...Can you address the issue of splitting the bill? My cousin is dating a guy who asks her to chip in and says he's \u201cnot an ATM.\u201d They go to a lot of \"fancier\" restaurants and I think it adds up over time. \u2014\u201cCousin\u201d CaityHe \u201csounds like an ass.\u201d But as much as I hate the ATM line, he\u2019s right. The rules about men paying for dates are rooted in the only part of the patriarchy I don\u2019t mind. But equality is equality. It\u2019s 2020! Split the bill! Tip 25 percent! Push your own chair in! Unless someone\u2019s feeling generous or has an expense account or it\u2019s your birthday, that\u2019s the way the world works. If the person you\u2019re dating favors \u201crestaurants you can\u2019t afford,\u201d you had better speak up before you\u2019re in \u201ccredit card debt.\u201d Don\u2019t be ashamed of living within your means. Suggest a less expensive spot, cook at home (see menu above), or break up!Explore Bon App\u00e9titIs It Ever OkayEtiquetteValentines DayRead MorecultureIs It Ever Okay\u2026to Bring a Plus-One to the Office Holiday Party?By Alex BeggscultureIs It Ever Okay...To Reject a Relative\u2019s Offer to Cook Something?By Alex BeggscultureIs It Ever Okay...to Eat Week-Old Crab Curry at Work?By Alex BeggscultureIs It Ever Okay\u2026to Ask the Restaurant to Turn Down the Music?By Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
