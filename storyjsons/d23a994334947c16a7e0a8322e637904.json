That\u2019s why I incorporated meaty bits of spicy-tangy Mexican-style chorizo and a handful of fiery Calabrian chiles into this stuffing recipe. The heat these ingredients bring is fairly subtle, just enough to activate your taste buds in between bites of roast turkey and rich green bean casserole, and keeps you coming back for more.\u201d \u2014Rachel Gurjar, associate food editorAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I've made it twice so far. Absolutely delicious flavor - the parsley, Mexican chorizo, and chilis are perfect together. My supermarket only had a jar of \"chopped\" Calabrian chilis. I used about 1.5 Tbsp, but I like spicy so next time I would use more (maybe 2 or 3 Tbsp). ChrisDelaware3/9/2022Delicious.  My husband made this for thanksgiving and we were all a little skeptical (he never cooks).  However the stuffing was excellent and there were no leftovers.  Many of the guests said it was their favourite.  A must make. AnonymousOrange, California1/5/2022Really delicious!!! Made mole this year instead of plain roasted turkey and this was a fun, decadent, side!MeauxDenver12/4/2021Delicious. Made with Trader Joe's Italian Bomba Fermented Calabrian Chiles and it was a perfect solution when I couldn't find the oil-packed ones. A big hit on the Thanksgiving table. KimiyoLos Angeles11/29/2021Great recipe, and \"custardy\" texture comment was spot on.  Will make again with less pepper flakes or sub aleppo instead of red chile.  Good as written, but very spicy compared to rest of standard Thanksgiving fare.MooseNRH, Texas11/26/2021Awesome. This came out so well. I couldn't find Calabrian chiles in a pinch but subbed crushed red pepper per the recipe's instruction. This got solid reviews from people @ the friendsgiving and I found myself craving the leftovers.Anonymouswashington, dc11/14/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titThanksgivingChileVegetableChorizoSausageMeatStuffingDinnerSideRecipes you want to make.
