It refuses to be put in a box (except literally, of course, to be mailed to your door). Whenever my pumpkin pies, pickling brines, soups, or braises need a little warmth and pizzazz, it\u2019s enigmatic allspice that I reach for first.Moving beyond function and into form, the allspice we know and love is actually a berry. Also known as a Jamaica pepper, myrtle pepper, or pimento, allspice is the unripe fruit of the Pimenta dioica, an evergreen tree in the Myrtle family native to the West Indies, Southern Mexico, and Central America. Once dried, the fruits look like peppercorns but fresh and unripe, the green berries more closely resemble olives. As my colleague and food editor Shilpa Uskokovic explains, allspice is \u201cpicked unripe and then fermented and dried before being packaged and sold.\u201dWhat allspice isn\u2019t, despite the gotcha name, is a whole bunch of spices mixed together, says Caroline Schiff, pastry chef at Gage & Tollner, executive chef at Slow Up, and author of the cookbook The Sweet Side of Sourdough. \u201cThat\u2019s a common misconception.\u201dSo, what\u2019s the flavor of allspice?It makes sense that allspice is often mistaken for a blend like Chinese five-spice or pumpkin spice\u2014because the flavor profile is multidimensional, featuring notes of cloves, nutmeg, star anise, fennel, black pepper, and cinnamon. It\u2019s warming, with a peppery and savory backbone, says Schiff. \u201cLike pumpkin spice\u2019s cool, sophisticated cousin who subscribes to The Paris Review, drinks natural wine, and claims to have never been to Starbucks.\u201d You know the one.How do I cook with allspice?Cooks around the world use allspice in both sweet and savory recipes, like \u201cJamaican jerk seasoning, Middle Eastern baharat, Swedish pickled herring, Mexican mole, Portuguese beef stew, and corned beef,\u201d Uskokovic says. You\u2019ll also notice traces of its characteristic complexity in aromatic liqueurs like Chartreuse and B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine.In recipes that call for pumpkin spice, Schiff loves to use allspice instead\u2014\u201cI think it adds some more complexity,\u201d she says\u2014and she\u2019ll often toast whole allspice berries in a dry pan before simmering in mulled cider or wine or infusing into milk and cream for ice cream. Uskokovic uses allspice most commonly in sweet recipes, adding \u201ca fat pinch or two to a thick, glossy caramel sauce that\u2019s good over ice cream, under a flan, or layered between rounds of cake.\u201d Come summer, she cooks whole allspice berries with apricots, sugar, fresh ginger, and lemon \u201cfor a heady jam\u201d that lasts her through the rest of the year.Allspice joins its friends cloves, cinnamon, and star anise in this warming-yet-tart cocktail.\nPeden + MunkAs a rule of thumb, the whole berries are most often deployed when a liquid is present: They\u2019ll infuse brines, stock, warm drinks, gravy, soups, simple syrups, stews, and sauces. The ground spice is ideal for baking\u2014add it straight to cookie doughs and cake batters\u2014and wherever else the spice will be directly consumed, like marinades, spice rubs, and meatball mixtures. Either way, \u201cadding allspice at the beginning of the cooking process maximizes its flavor release,\u201d Uskokovic says. \u201cAnd allspice almost always benefits from the application of heat (i.e., cooked in a custard rather than sprinkled on top of a pie).\u201dReady to experiment? Swoosh this Spiced Labneh under fried eggs, smear it on toast, or use it as a dip for crudit\u00e9s and pita bread. Make an allspice-spiked Amaro Cocktail and sip it until spring. Give your cold winter soul a warm hug via these Caribbean braised oxtails. Sip on hot Cashew Chilate (enjoy it with a slice of sweet Salvadoran Quesadilla). Brew a peppy Iced Caf\u00e9 de Olla and pretend it\u2019s summer. Double this batch of Palestinian Musakhan (your future self will thank you). And, of course, classic apple pie is a no-brainer.Should I buy ground or whole allspice berries?According to Schiff, don\u2019t bother with the pre-ground stuff. \u201cIt has a fraction of the flavor as the whole berry,\u201d she says. Like coffee, ground allspice will lose potency and freshness over time, which is why it\u2019s always best to buy whole berries and process them in an electric spice grinder as needed. This is the case for all spices, but it\u2019s \u201cdoubly true for allspice,\u201d adds Uskokovic, \u201cwhich most of us may not be using as frequently.\u201d In other words: Be careful not to grind more than you can use or it\u2019ll go stale. Lucky for us, whole allspice berries are available at the click of your mouse:Whole Allspice$5.68 at SpicewallaWhat can I substitute if I don\u2019t have allspice on hand?Allspice is enigmatic, warm, and versatile\u2014one of a kind, really. Irreplaceable. But if you\u2019re in a bind, you can make a knock-off spice blend using an equal mix of ground clove, ground cinnamon, and ground nutmeg, Uskokovic says.All in on AllspiceCharred Cabbage and CarrotsCabbage deserves more credit\u2014char it, braise it, spice it, and turn it into the best thing on the table with a little help from a maple-lime dressing.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingAllspiceRecipes you want to make.
