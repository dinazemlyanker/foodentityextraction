It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Where is Alex Lau?Our staff photographer and winner of a 2019 ASME Next award Alex Lau, keeps a low profile. Sometimes so low, no one can find him. He uses decoy location tags on Instagram like an international spy. We celebrated his ASME award recently and staffers recited a poem called \u201cWhere\u2019s Lau?\u201d that Shel Silverstein would have applauded. Then we ate piles of dumplings from Nom Wah Tea Parlor and at some point I looked around, and Lau was gone again. I caught up with the talented and elusive one, who was drinking a diet green tea Snapple in the Test Kitchen, so we could find the answer:Where was Lau this week? Quebec.What\u2019s Lau reading? Shoe Dog, the memoir of Nike founder Phil Knight. Lau highly recommends this fast and fun read, even if you don\u2019t care about sports.What\u2019s Lau listening to? He loves podcasts, and he can\u2019t stop thinking about the episode of The Daily about New York\u2019s elite public high schools.Where\u2019s Lau going next? Seattle, to visit his girlfriend.Want this letter before it hits the website?

Jesse had lifted his locs from his neck and was fanning himself. He looked distraught. \u201cJesse, are you...okay?\u201d I asked. \u201cI\u2019m really not,\u201d replied Jesse. It turns out he and Aliza had applied caffeine patches that arrived with very little instruction or information, definitely not FDA-approved. \u201cOverall good experience,\u201d was Jesse\u2019s review once he got over the initial rush and just became \u201cfast.\u201d Then he sent me the meme, seen above. I\u2019m still concerned.What\u2019s on Chris Morocco\u2019s station?I know Adam wrote about Chris Morocco\u2019s famous analytical mind this week, but he left out a crucial, character-defining detail. And that\u2019s Chris Morocco\u2019s Rolodex. It\u2019s so worn that the edges are soft to the touch. Usually it remains on his desk, but on an especially hectic recipe-testing day it appeared on his work station, amidst piles of ingredients. \u201cIt was open to his LinkedIn password!\u201d Exclaimed Molly Baz, \u201cI was like, dad! But I love it.\u201d Carla Lalli Music said, \u201cIt is LEGENDARY. It is for people who remember pencils and pens. It is for people who used to \u2018work the phone.\u2019\u201d Chris\u2019s rebuttal: \u201cIts luster may have faded over the years but I can cram several lifetimes full of log-ins, account numbers, and VIP contacts in there.\u201d I heard there\u2019s one page that just says, \u201cKayak.com.\u201dPour out a packetOf Swiss Miss, because the inventor of the dehydrated cocoa mix, Charles Sanna, died this week at 101. In a recent interview with the The Wisconsin State Journal he said: \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know that you\u2019ve done something that will carry on.\u201d If my math\u2019s correct, the secret to a long life is drinking hot powdered milk.Photo by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiUpdateRemember last week when I told you I was going to make these brussels sprout tacos and the cinnamon tamal? Well both turned out fantastic. The tacos were some of the best I\u2019ve ever made, and INGENIOUS. There\u2019s a layer of spicy peanut butter sauce, fried brussels tossed in a tangy fish sauce-scallion-vinegar, all topped off with white onion and avocado, lime, etc. I shoveled three into my face before I remembered what all those brussels were going to do to me. \ud83d\udca8 The tamal was super moist, barely sweet, with this deep corn-on-corn flavor, and you serve it with  cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche mixed with queso fresco for a creamy-sour-salty effect. What! A! Good! Idea!Get the recipes: Brussels Sprout Tacos with Spicy Peanut Butter and Sweet Cinnamon TamalThis week in wineThe working title for this fun story by Emily Schultz was \u201cI Wasn\u2019t Expecting To Have Anything in Common with Kourtney Kardashian But Here We Are.\u201dUnnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekWhile we were developing an upcoming Healthyish breakfast sandwich recipe (stay tuned\u2014coming next week!), the staff divided into two camps. Do people make breakfast sandwiches on weekdays, or is this strictly a weekend food? And by divided I mean, only Alex Delany makes them on weekdays. Amiel Stanek will scramble an egg \u201cwhen I\u2019m hungover. But when do you ever happen to have rolls in your house?\u201d \u201cBut what if you DID,\u201d pleaded Delany. He soon found an ally: \u201cIf a \u2018breakfast sandwich\u2019 is a 30-second scramble on toast with mayo, a dash of hot sauce, and a slice of cheese, this happens 1-2 times a week at Chez Music,\u201d said Carla, \u201cand a minor child is the recipient. If he\u2019s lucky there might be a couple pieces of little gem on top.\u201d Put that in your cookbook! \u201cMake yourselves cereal, losers,\u201d said Emily Schultz, doing an impression of her own mother. \u201cI won\u2019t spend 30 minutes prepping the night before, for breakfast the next day,\u201d said Meryl Rothstein. \u201cIT DOESN\u2019T HAVE TO BE LIKE THAT\u201d \u2014Delany was getting worked up. He used to make them all the time, he told us, \u201cbefore I cared about my heart health.\u201d The thing is, Amanda Shapiro told us, this wasn\u2019t the most controversial detail about the Healthyish breakfast sandwich. \u201cWait until you guys hear about the onion bacon.\u201dHere\u2019s a breakfast sandwich recipe to tide you over until next week.
