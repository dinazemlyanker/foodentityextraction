It\u2019s MaggiComplex and loaded with umami, this potent liquid seasoning is beloved around the world.By Sylvio MartinsDecember 23, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhotograph by Isa Zapata. \u00a0Food Styling by Micah Morton. \u00a0Prop styling by Paige HicksFacebookTwitterEmailAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Next up, Sylvio Martins makes the case for Maggi Seasoning.When I was growing up, our family road trips from Phoenix to Tijuana often ended at the same taqueria for some much needed quesatacos. As I\u2019d wait for my dinner, I\u2019d keep my teenage appetite at bay with the restaurant\u2019s complimentary starter: charred chiles g\u00fceros drenched in lime juice and a thin, salty sauce. The dressing was just bold enough to dull the peppers\u2019 heat and had a rich, almost meaty flavor that I couldn\u2019t pinpoint. Years later, after I found my love for cooking and began asking relatives for Mexican recipes, I came to discover that the mysterious condiment tossed all over those charred chiles was, in fact, the secret ingredient in so many of my favorite dishes. It was none other than Maggi.Photograph by Isa Zapata. \u00a0Prop Styling by Paige HicksJugo Maggi Seasoning Sauce$12 at Amazon (for 2)$1 at Walmart (for 1)Describing Maggi can be tricky without drawing comparisons to other condiments. It\u2019s similar to soy sauce in both appearance and consistency but differs slightly in flavor. It can also be likened to Worcestershire sauce, but it doesn\u2019t quite carry that same faint sweetness. It\u2019s uniquely Maggi, with a smoky and somewhat roasted flavor reminiscent of grilled onions or the charred bits of a steak. \u201cMaggi is a staple in every Mexican kitchen condiment cabinet, and it was always in my house,\u201d says Octavio Olivas, chef-owner of L.A.\u2019s Ceviche Project. \u201cI taste a little bit of soy, a little bit of salt, and smokiness. It\u2019s super complex, and it has its own flavor. I think of it as an umami bomb that I use for multiple things, like marinating steak, enhancing salsas, and, of course, micheladas.\u201dBut much to my surprise, Maggi isn\u2019t a Mexican product\u2014or at least it wasn\u2019t initially. The brand was founded in Switzerland in the late 19th century and marketed to the busy working class as a nutritious ready-to-use food product like pea- and bean-based flours and instant soups. It released its liquid seasoning, Maggi W\u00fcrze, in 1886. Made from fermented wheat and packed with glutamic acid (an amino acid from which MSG is derived), this dark-colored sauce delivers an umami saltiness reminiscent of Marmite. Its ability to instantly, almost miraculously, heighten the flavors of foods with just a few drops has made it a trusted and beloved addition to kitchen pantries worldwide. Globally, you\u2019ll find country-specific varieties of Maggi that differ slightly in flavor, including a Filipino version with strong notes of garlic, the original Swiss-German recipe with a complex vegetable taste, and, of course, the Mexican formula that\u2019s noticeably sharper and more concentrated than its nuanced relatives.Maggi tastes wonderful when dashed on top of velvety eggs, mixed into stir-fries, or splashed into sauces for added depth of flavor. Both noodle and rice dishes happily welcome Maggi\u2019s rich saltiness, as do marinades and seafood dishes like Mexican aguachile or Baja-style ceviche. Or, similar to the chiles g\u00fceros I enjoyed as a kid, Maggi seasoning can transform the simplest of dishes like roasted vegetables into something much more complex. To me Maggi tastes like late-night taquerias, but you\u2019ll surely hear a diversity of answers, depending on where you are in the world.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make.
