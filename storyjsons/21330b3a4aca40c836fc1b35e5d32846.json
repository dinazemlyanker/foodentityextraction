Next up, contributing writer Kate McAuley reluctantly gives Vegemite Pizza a go.Here I am, casually thumbing through Instagram on an unseasonably warm October morning, when a video featuring Giovanni Fabiano, an Italian-born, Brooklyn-based pizza chef, pops up in my feed. Normally, my under-caffeinated brain would have kept on scrolling, but something odd catches my eye: this sweet-faced Don of the Dough is sporting a corduroy cap emblazoned with none other than the distinctive red and yellow logo of Australia\u2019s beloved Vegemite. My beloved Vegemite.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.With mild horror, I, an Aussie living in New York City, watch on as Giovanni adds a generous squirt of my favorite sandwich spread onto a classic pie at the restaurant he owns, Rosa\u2019s Pizza, in Williamsburg. He then showers it with shredded mozzarella and slides it into a Marsal oven. According to the chef, an official Vegemite ambassador, we Aussies have been eating Vegemite all wrong. \u201cYou put it on toast, I make pizza with it,\u201d he proclaims in the promo video. \u201cIt tastes like Australia.\u201d All right, mate, I\u2019ll be the judge of that.For the uninitiated, Vegemite is a thick, dark brown, supremely salty spread that is made from a heady mix of leftover brewer\u2019s yeast and a few other additions, including malt, folate, and riboflavin. Developed in Australia in 1922, it was our direct answer to the United Kingdom\u2019s popular and older, but far inferior Marmite. As a kid, it was a staple in my family\u2019s pantry because of its high levels of B vitamins (that\u2019s 1980s wellness for you) and all-around deliciousness. The latter, however, is a fact that I\u2019m yet to convince my U.S. friends of, no matter what Giovanni says.Whenever I\u2019ve tried to indoctrinate my mates, all I\u2019ve received in response are creased noses, furrowed brows, and gagging noises punctuated by statements akin to, \u201cWTF is this Hell Paste?\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t you dare come near me with that.\u201d And then they\u2019ll try and guess what it is: \u201cEw. What\u2019s that smell? Fish? Beef? An augury of an imminent zombie apocalypse?\u2019\u201d Actually, people, Vegemite is as vegan as most of Brooklyn these days\u2014not that it matters if you won\u2019t even give it a go.Oh, sorry, do I sound salty? The truth is, I\u2019ve been in a funk since I arrived back in the U.S. from Australia in August. Tragically, a death in the family plucked me out of New York lockdown in fall 2020 and plonked me down in a then relatively COVID-19-free Sydney. I thought I\u2019d be there for a month. I stayed a year. It had been decades since I\u2019d spent that much time in my homeland and those months felt like a gift. I traveled as much as border restrictions would allow, swam in the ocean, and marveled at the big open skies. I reacquainted myself with old friends and spent some quality time with my family. I even got to work on a couple of cookbook projects. Naturally, reentry to New York has not gone smoothly. Doomscrolling and wallowing in homesickness, I\u2019m in no mood to be challenged by an Italian maestro and his gimmicky pizza.But it does pain me to admit: Giovanni might be onto something. Every Aussie knows that Vegemite is best when scraped sparingly onto a thick slice of toast with lashings of butter, but it also holds its own when paired with chunks of bite-y cheddar cheese and fat slices of fresh tomato. I\u2019ve even added it to sauces and soups when I didn\u2019t have salty stock on hand. If used appropriately, Vegemite lends a subtle umami flavor to many a savory dish (kinda like miso). So can it work on pizza? There\u2019s only one way to find out.With its wall of stainless-steel deck ovens, glass cabinets, sparse seating, and array of shakers full of dried mixed herbs and chili flakes, Rosa\u2019s Pizza, is one of those classic New York pie joints\u2014a humble type of place where a slice fresh from the oven reliably transcends the atmosphere. Giovanni\u2019s smile is infectious as he spins the dough from one skilled hand to the other until it\u2019s the size of an old-timey wagon wheel. (I obviously called ahead to make sure I could watch the whole spectacle go down.) Next comes the marinara sauce\u2014a glossy dousing replete with fresh tomatoes, basil, and oregano. It\u2019s the Vegemite, however, that gives him pause. \u201cIs this too much?\u201d he enquires as he spirals the thick black spread across the pie. I reply with a shrug. That\u2019s what I\u2019m here to find out. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll see,\u201d he says before topping it off with grated cheese and sliding it into the inferno.While the pizza is cooking, I head outside to find my dining pal\u2014an open-minded, born and bred Brooklynite I cajoled into joining me on this gastronomic experiment. \u201cLet it rest,\u201d the server suggests, as he drops the steaming pizza onto our plywood picnic table. \u201cLast night people were too eager and the topping slid off.\u201d As ordered, we watch and wait, noses twitching at the pleasing (for me, at least) Vegemite-tinged aroma, until the cheese begins to congeal.I slide a slice onto a paper plate, fold it in half, and guide the pointy end into my mouth. My teeth sink through the familiar viscosity of melty cheese. The sauce is silky, the dough chewy. But it\u2019s not until I pull away, with strings of mozzarella cobwebbing my chin, that I get a hit of Vegemite. There it is. Loud and rambunctious. Salty as all hell. Unapologetic and punching above its weight. The first bite drops me back, like a rogue seashell, onto the soft sand at Bondi Beach.The spread-to-sauce ratio is surprisingly well balanced (most newbies go to town; rookie mistake). But as a combination, I\u2019m not sure it does the sum of its parts justice. Rosa\u2019s Pizza is perfect on its own. As is Vegemite. Vegemite pizza, on the other hand, is a bit, well, unnecessary. I would probably eat it again, if only for a taste of home when the jumbo jars my family ship over inevitably run out. But I\u2019m gonna be honest: toast, butter, and a smear of V is still number one.As my friend and I walk back toward the G train, we pass Rocka Rolla, a dive bar we\u2019ve never been to before. It seems like the perfect place for a postprandial debrief (a.k.a. it exists and it\u2019s not too busy). Inside we order goblets of ice-cold beer to hydrate our palates and cop a squat in one of the booths. After a few sips and a bit of banter, I notice an AC/DC neon sign on the far wall. And then, as if on cue, the Aussie band\u2019s worldwide hit, \u201cT.N.T.,\u201d starts pumping out of the speakers. New York dive bars and a lick of quintessential Oz rock? Now this is a pairing I can get behind.Explore Bon App\u00e9titA Skeptic TriesCultureRead MorecultureA Skeptic Tries: Swedish FishBy Justine LeecultureA Skeptic Tries: Dairy Queen's Dipped ConeBy Ali FranciscultureA Skeptic Tries: Quitting CoffeeBy Luna AdlerRecipes you want to make.
