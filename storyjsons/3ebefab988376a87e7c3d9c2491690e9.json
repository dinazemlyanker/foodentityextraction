Happy to say this one doesn\u2019t.IngredientsMakes 22Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil4garlic cloves2bunches Tuscan kale, center ribs and stems removed, leaves coarsely torn1cup sauerkraut, drained\u00bccup whole-milk Greek yogurt1tsp. hot sauceKosher salt4slices rye or whole wheat bread2slices Swiss cheese (about 3 oz. total)\u00bccup finely grated Parmesan2Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature, dividedPreparationStep 1Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium-low. Add garlic and cook, turning occasionally, until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Add kale in handfuls, stirring often and letting each addition wilt before adding the next. Stir in \u00bd cup water. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Continue to cook, tossing occasionally, until kale is tender and pan is dry (add more water as needed if kale needs more time), about 5 minutes. Transfer kale to a medium bowl; discard garlic, if desired. Stir in sauerkraut, yogurt, and hot sauce; season with salt. Wipe out skillet.Step 2Divide kale mixture between 2 slices of bread. Top kale mixture with both cheeses. Close sandwiches with remaining bread, then spread 1 Tbsp. butter on top slices.Step 3Heat reserved skillet over medium-low. Add sandwiches buttered side down and press down gently with a pan lid. Butter top sides of sandwiches and cook, turning sandwiches once, until golden brown and crisp and cheese is melted, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and cut in half before serving.How would you rate Kale Reuben?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (27)Back to TopTriangleI've never actually had a \"real\" reuben before so take this review with a grain of salt...that said, I loved this sandwich! Definitely will try the real thing now, but will turn to this for a quick and (relatively) \"healthy\" lunch. Only change is I think I'd add a true Russian dressing next time. \nIt's also easily modified for different dietary preferences. I'm an omnivore partnered with a vegan so this dish was an easy and delicious middle-ground meal. Simply sub in vegan mayo, cheese, and butter for half the batch. \nLastly, I'm also not a big fan of kale, but really liked it in this dish. Perhaps you've made a (kale) convert out of me, Chris! SAArlington, VA7/7/2021This sandwich is amazing.  Thank you!  We are vegan, so I skipped the cheese and put a little marinated tofu on instead, and grilled the whole thing on olive bread.  So tasty, love bonappetit.com so much.Amy Elvis KiehlLos Angeles6/9/2021This sandwich far exceeded my expectations!  Not a big fan of kale here, but get it in my farm boxall the time! It is creamy and tangy and just the right texture! Definitely will make again and a again.StepanlOlympia, WA12/22/2020This is one of my go-to recipes now.  I make it about once a week just because it's so quick and easy and tasty!\nI like to make it with a mixture of mayo and greek yogurt.  Less healthy I guess, but gives it a better flavor imo (especially since I don't use a lot of cheese on mine).  \n\nIt's a really stellar recipe that I've recommended to a lot of my friends-- with the caveat that it's not really gonna hit the spot if you want an actual reuben.  I consider it entirely its own thing. AnonymousChicago10/6/2020Worked very well! I skipped the yogurt and put Thousand Island dressing on top after it came off the heat. (Could also put mustard if that's how you like your Reuben.) I also made one using butter and another with a thin layer of mayo (like I do with grilled cheese), and the mayo browned more evenly (no mayo taste - try it!) than the butter version.Dan from CT8/15/2020This is so yummy! It kind of feels like a fancy, veg-forward grilled cheese? But sauerkraut is a total comfort food for me and it's SO GOOD with the Greek yogurt, hot sauce, and kale. It isn't that fancy, but it sure is delish.\n\nDropping 1 star because (1) I wouldn't really call it a reuben, and (2) we were MORE THAN FINE with only one bunch of kale.mrs.vinegarChesterton, Indiana6/18/2020This sandwich is easy and very tasty. I don't eat reubens so I won't involve myself in that discourse, but this is a flavorful and filling melty treat.Anonymous5/29/2020Good! I echo the other reviewer: This isn't reminiscent of a reuben, but is a good sandwich on its own merits.AnonymousCalifornia5/25/2020A really good sandwich! Although it didn't really scream \"rueben\" to me while I was eating it, and it's more good despite the kale, rather than because of it. It felt like a delicious fancy grilled cheese with some greens added to downgrade the cheese/hot sauce/more cheese guilt factor. I'd eat it again, but it's not the first recipe I'd reach for. Anonymous4/3/2020This sandwich is great. I didn't miss the meat at all. My housemate added a fried egg which I will surely do next time around. I don't know how big the bunches in the recipe calls for, however, I found 1 bunch to be sufficient (it was a large bunch). I also used smaller bread however still had an excess of filling (though I will happily use it tomorrow for another sando.  Super quick and easy to make with impressive flavors. BingoBronson8/28/2019Love this sandwich concept! Admittedly, I am not a sauerkraut fan and ended up using more of a soy sauce, garlic, sriracha approach (plus some pre-roasted mushrooms). So no, I didn\u2019t make this exact recipe, but it just goes to show that this is a very riff-able sandwich that is so easy to throw together in just a few minutes! AnonymousBoston, MA7/30/2019Delicious!! Came together very easily, works well as a weeknight dinner. Thanks Chris!

I didn't have any yogurt on hand so I substituted mayo.  It was incredible!  Super easy to make and to be honest, I didn't miss the pastrami one bit.  I will definitely make this again.   AnonymousNorman, OK4/11/2019I LOVE this sandwich! Made it multiple times and keep coming back to it as I daydream about dinner. In fact, I'm going to go make it right now. So tangy, so yummy.
