It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.August is the best month, and I\u2019m not just saying that because it\u2019s almost my birthday. The multicolored bounty I\u2019ve encountered the past couple of weekends at my neighborhood farmers market has truly restored my faith in humanity. Everything is shooting out of the ground right now\u2014berries, greens, tomatoes, eggplants, lettuces, melons, peaches, nectarines, plums, beans, greens, corn, cukes, and peppers, too. I hauled so much produce home on Saturday morning that I got a legit core and back workout on the three-block walk back to my house. Yes, August carries with it a tinge of despair (September lurks), but the earth\u2019s gifts offer a more optimistic take.Want this letter before it hits the website?

Purchase anything that appeals, even if you don\u2019t know what it is! Case in point: I couldn\u2019t help overhearing a couple the other morning who encountered a big bin of just-picked yellow runner beans, decided that they were wax beans, and bought them anyway! I was going to jump in and tell them what they really were, but since you can do anything to a runner bean that you would do with a wax bean, I held back. Runner beans, like green beans (a.k.a. string beans), haricot verts, wax beans, and sugar snap peas, are all in the snap bean family\u2014you can snack on them raw, steam, boil, or saut\u00e9 them, batter and fry them, or grill them. Satisfied with my own bean knowledge, I grabbed several handfuls of runner beans for myself, knowing I\u2019d figure out something to do with them.I could saut\u00e9 them with garlic and oil, I told myself, which would take about five minutes. I could stew them, Grandma style, a method that\u2019s totally hands-off. Or I could slow-roast them in place of the green beans in this recipe, which would yield a lot of gorgeous harissa-and-cumin-infused oil, too. Then I remembered an incredibly simple but delicious dish I had recently at the Williamsburg, Brooklyn, restaurant Misi: grilled runner beans tossed with olive oil, salt, and lots of red wine vinegar (those beans pictured at the top). Served floppy but still crunchy and lashed with grill marks, this three-ingredient summer dish stole the (side) show. I have some basil growing on my deck, which I\u2019ll probably throw in there, too. This time of year, if you\u2019ve got it, flaunt it.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterRead MorecookingSmashed Green Beans Are the Best Green BeansBy Molly BazLifestyleThis Chicken and Beans Stir-Fry Redeems Boneless, Skinless Chicken BreastsBy Chris MoroccocookingBefore You Eat or Cook Snap Peas, You've Got to Do ThisBy Alex DelanycookingThis Cheesy, Crispy Broccoli Skillet Might Be Best Thing I\u2019ve Ever MadeBy Carla Lalli MusicRecipes you want to make.
