In a dream world, we'd move into her East Hampton home and have roast chicken with her and Jeffrey every night. Instead, we invited the Barefoot Contessa into our house, as our first-ever guest editor. This week, she's taking over bonappetit.com to show us around her pantry, share recipes from her new cookbook Cook Like a Pro, and offer the kind of cooking advice that only Ina can. She'll be joined by celebrity fans who've penned odes to their favorite Ina recipes, and she'll cook side by side with our Test Kitchen editors. Below, hear from Ina herself on what to expect this week and the reasons why she said \u201cyes\u201d to us in the first place.\u00a0\n\u00a0Cooking is hard. I want to make it easier by teaching people the correct way to do things. If you have the right tools, like a perfectly sharpened knife, you can do anything\u2014from slicing tomatoes to making chocolate-pecan scones\u2014and do it calmly and with confidence.I learned to cook from reading cookbooks by Julia Child, Jacques Pepin, and The New York Times\u2019 Craig Claiborne and Pierre Franey; now I want to pass that experience on to you at home, whether you\u2019re a beginner or an expert in the kitchen. I\u2019m still not expecting anyone to make demi-glace or cassoulet, which takes all day\u2014order those in a restaurant. What I want people to understand is that they can take ordinary recipes like roasted carrots and give them a twist. Add orange juice, orange zest, and cut them in long diagonals, and you\u2019ve got something really special.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.These small tweaks are my \u201cpro tips,\u201d which can be found in almost every recipe in Cook Like a Pro, and I\u2019ll be sharing more during my guest-editing week at Bon App\u00e9tit.This week\u2014and just like in my books and on my TV show\u2014I hope to answer questions that people have about cooking at home, but may never have thought to ask: What to keep in the pantry, how to arrange food on platters for parties, and why shortcuts can make dishes easier to tackle, but just as impressive to share. Take Baked Alaska: You don\u2019t have to make your own vanilla ice cream if someone else does it better, and H\u00e4agen-Dazs does. It takes one intimidating step out of the process.I\u2019m a longtime reader of BA, and I think the style of cooking in the magazine is consistent with mine: great food for home cooks. And like BA\u2019s food editors, I test recipes over and over again with my assistants Barbara and Lidey, so that you can nail it the first time you make it. And as long as you follow the instructions, and make the recipe from start to finish, the dishes will come out exactly as I made them in my kitchen.In making all 11 of my cookbooks, I\u2019ve only had one rule: It has to be delicious and easy enough that I want to make it again\u2014and right away. The easier a recipe is to make, the more likely that is to happen. After all, before you host a party, you just have to first please an audience of one. It's my goal to help you do that.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIna GartenRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
