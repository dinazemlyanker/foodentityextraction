Growing up tucked into 16,000 acres of Australian bush, there were no salacious McDonald\u2019s billboards anywhere, which meant my mum successfully tricked my brother and me into believing that whole wheat porridge was life\u2019s greatest joy. Oooh, raisins today! we\u2019d squawk, grinning our gobs off and heaping scoops of dry bran on top.Now that I\u2019m an adult woman and at liberty to curate my own breakfast spreads, you best believe Pop-Tarts are front and center. But not just any Pop-Tart! I\u2019m talking about Wild Fruits, a family-run operation in the North Country of New York selling handmade riffs that leave the original Pop-Tarts back in 1964, where they belong. Unlike those 50-some ingredient packaged treats (I lost count after \u201cblue 1\u201d), Wild Fruits jam tarts are made of just seven: milk, flour, butter, sugar, egg, pectin, and locally grown fruits.Let\u2019s talk about the flavor lineup. The blueberry is so packed with berries it almost feels good for me. The seasonal apple pie deserves a notable mention. I\u2019m eagerly anticipating the forthcoming sticky date(!), which I\u2019m taking as a nod to my favorite Australian dessert. But my favorite Wild Fruits flavor is the strawberry rhubarb. The magic lies in its holy trinity\u2014flaky butter dough; perfectly sweet-tart jam; and a slick of jam-laced, fruity frosting\u2014which head baker (a.k.a. Mom) Roberta Yaeger says are all inspired by different family recipes. \u201cOur family is known for strawberry rhubarb pie, and we use my mother\u2019s pie recipe for the dough and then my grandmother\u2019s orange drop cookie recipe for the frosting,\u201d she says.All of the fruit is sourced in the Adirondacks, from places like ADK Growers, LLC., Fobares Fruits, and Martin\u2019s Country Store, as well as locals-only spots: \u201cThe family rhubarb patches, secret dirt roads, and the Amish farm stands,\u201d says Jake Yaeger, son and logistics lead. \u201cWe\u2019re truly an East Coast company,\u201d agrees Rachel Yaeger, daughter and marketing brains. It goes without saying that fruit picked locally and in-season makes for superior jam\u2014the kind that tastes like the plump berries and blush-colored stalks it\u2019s made from, and not just miscellaneous sweetness. (One thing to note is that each batch of Wild Fruits is made to order, which is why they taste so fresh but only have a two-week shelf life.)Since Wild Fruits launched in June 2019, most of its orders end up in its home state, as well as boutique stores like Pop Up Grocer in NYC and Flying Lotus in Canton, NY (where the jam tarts are made). But online orders across the board have peaked throughout the pandemic. \u201cI think with people being locked in at home they\u2019re an easy, thoughtful, and homemade item that can be sent to friends and family,\u201d Rachael says.\u00a0Buying a variety pack as a gift to oneself is advisable\u2014a sweet touch in a thoroughly bitter year. To stretch out my bounty, I like to start each morning with a tart roulette. I cut whichever flavor comes out of the box into quarters, eat the little squares one at a time with my pinkie raised like they\u2019re cucumber sandwiches and I\u2019m the Queen of England. And while I\u2019d like to say that I still opt for good old porridge some mornings, mum\u2019s always said I\u2019m a terrible liar.Wild Fruits Variety Box$20 at Wild FruitsExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendShoppingPastryRecipes you want to make.
