I could spend hours scrolling through Instagram admiring perfectly sculpted cookies or gloriously manicured confections.That\u2019s why I knew the first time I saw senior food editor Molly Baz\u2019s perfectly circular Roasty Toasty Pecan-Caramel Shortbread Cookies that I needed her secret. In the past, my own slice-and-bake cookies have come out of the oven looking more like approximations of circles than actual circles. They were wonky and smushed, like the shapes I drew when I was first learning how to use a compass (um, remember those?). I\u2019d spent so much time chalking up the symmetrical shaping to witchcraft, so I was willing to do anything to get those platonic rounds. I asked Molly to tell me her ways.No sharp edges allowed on these rye shortbread.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensTo start, Molly prepares her cookie dough and places it in the center of a sheet of parchment paper or plastic wrap. She then folds the parchment up and over the cookie dough so she can roll it into a rough log. If the dough is too sticky at this point, she recommends putting it in the freezer for ten minutes so it can chill until it\u2019s firmer but still malleable.With the parchment still folded over the log, she\u2019ll use a bench scraper, ruler, or some other straight edge to press against the dough while slowly pulling on the top layer of parchment paper. This creates a rolling effect that smooths out any lumps and bumps in your cookie dough log. (You can watch Molly do this whole process on Basically\u2019s Instagram story.) To make sure that not too much dough is slipping underneath your bench scraper as you pull, work quickly so that the dough remains chilled.Once you\u2019ve got an even log, toss it into the fridge for 90 minutes (or the freezer for 20). This will set you up to cut cookies like a pro. In the meantime, figure out what exactly dulce de leche is, make sure your oven is at the right temperature, or whisper affirmations to yourself about how you really are great a baker (have some confidence, kiddo!).When your dough is thoroughly chilled and firm, you\u2019re ready to slice. Molly recommends rotating the log 90 degrees after cutting two or three cookies. This limits the amount of pressure you\u2019re putting on cookies in a single direction so that they don\u2019t start to squish or flatten on one side. Think of it like crisis management, but for cookies.Once you have your RoundBoys\u2122, you\u2019re ready to get baking. But wait! Freeze the cookies for at least 10 minutes so that they hold that perfectly circular shape you\u2019ve worked so hard to achieve.Get the recipe:Roasty Toasty Pecan-Caramel Shortbread CookiesStore-bought dulce de leche and pulverized pecans give this tender, buttery shortbread a nuttiness and depth of flavor you can\u2019t quite put your finger on. We love the contrasting look of white nonpareil, but feel free to roll the dough in whatever sprinkles you please.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasically BakingShortbreadCookieRecipes you want to make.
