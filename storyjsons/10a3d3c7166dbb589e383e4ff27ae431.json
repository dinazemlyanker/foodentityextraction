With just the right balance of crispiness and spongy-squishiness (and I mean this in the best possible sense), plus a fiery, salty sauce, it's the most versatile, protein-heavy side/condiment/snack in my repertoire. I've made it almost every month for the past two years. And I would eat them a lot more\u2014say, alongside every single meal\u2014if I had the opportunity.Of course it helps that the method is so easy to execute. See, in a pre-Spicy Tofu Crumbles world, I would pan-fry tofu by cutting it up, then tending to each delicate cube in the pan with an eagle eye. I used baby tongs, a fork, or even a wee offset spatula (permission to roll your eyes granted) to flip every cube from side to side... to side, to side, making sure no piece was left pale. It was a precious and ridiculous process that consumed too much of my precious and ridiculous time. This recipe offers sweet relief! By cooking the tofu in large, thick slabs, you only have a handful of pieces to turn just once.Forget the noodles: The spicy tofu crumbles are the star of this ramen noodle bowl with escarole.\nPhoto by Peden + MunkOnce the slabs are on the browner side of golden brown, you'll let them cool and then tear them up with your fingers. You can also use the dullest knife in your kitchen to achieve the same goal: craggy, uneven tofu crumbles with plenty of crevasses to catch and absorb all of the spicy sauce.That sauce is made, very conveniently, from ingredients you probably already have: soy sauce, mirin, Sriracha or gochujang, rice vinegar, and toasted sesame oil. There are also a couple of fresh ingredients\u2014thinly sliced Fresno chile and grated fresh ginger\u2014both of which I've left out in times of need (I've also swapped out the Fresno for a jalape\u00f1o and a Serrano and have not been worse for the wear).If you don't pop all of these little tofu crumblettes into your mouth before they get to the table, you'll find tons of ways to use them: with soft scrambled eggs in breakfast tacos, piled atop a bowl of sesame noodles, bobbing on kimchi and vegetable soup, perched on steaming white rice with stir-fried shrimp. I put them in burritos, on kale salads, and under my pillow, where I hope the tooth fairy will replace them with even more tofu crumbles. Because while they last five days in the fridge (a meal prep miracle!), I always go through a batch before that time comes.Get the recipe:Spicy Tofu CrumblesTry this versatile protein-packed side/condiment/snack tossed into stir-fries, as a burrito filling, or folded into saut\u00e9ed greens.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titTofuWeeknightSpicyRead MorecookingThis Roasted Broccoli Recipe Indulges All My Food ObsessionsBy Elaheh NozariRecipes you want to make.
