I was the person in college who never complained about our dining hall coffee, which I would drink at breakfast, lunch, and after dinner. If it was hot (or even hottish), strong, and caffeinated, I was in.These days my standards are a little higher\u2014as in I\u2019m the proud owner of a Chemex (for sake of simplicity and ease of cleaning) and I grind my beans at home. But still, there\u2019s really only one thing that can make me inconsolably distressed when it comes to coffee, and that\u2019s when the coffee doesn\u2019t exist. How will my brain, body, or soul function properly? For me the limiting factor isn\u2019t the beans themselves (I would never let that happen), but the paper filters that fit into my Chemex.After too many days of fumbling around the cabinet at 6 a.m. only to realize that the box that normally contains the filters was tragically empty (I blame my husband), I decided to buy a reusable stainless-steel coffee filter. It saves paper, it saves money (the upfront cost evens out over time), and it saves me from googling \u201cwhat can I use instead of a coffee filter?\u201d and then seeing how many layers of cheesecloth it will take\u2026. And because it\u2019s dishwasher-safe, it\u2019s not even that annoying to clean.Full disclosure: There\u2019s much debate in the barista community (of which I\u2019m not a member) about whether a steel or paper filter makes for a better cup. Compared to paper filters, which absorb more of the beans\u2019 oils and strain out more sediment, a cup of coffee that drips through a metal filter will be richer and fuller bodied. I\u2019ll leave the discussion to the experts and say, that as an amateur, I haven\u2019t noticed a difference. As long as I can keep making coffee without a hiccup, I\u2019m thrilled.Barista Warrior Pour Over Coffee Filter$32 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingCoffeeRead MorecultureThis Extremely Precise Electric Kettle Grounds Me in the MorningBy Rachel KartenRecipes you want to make.
