I will say, \u201cSurprise me!\u201d to the voice on the line, then quickly clarify my preferences. This frustrating dance translates into: Feed me whatever you want...so long as it is also what I want. Like I said, easy-breezy!The folks at Nice Day\u2014a new Chinese American pop-up by Junzi Kitchen, which has been running out of its Bleecker Street location since August\u2014handled this conundrum expertly. In addition to my very unsubtle pleas for mapo tofu, kung pao chicken, and beef chow mein (\u201cHa ha, oh, truly, whatever you recommend though!\u201d), they added a surprise to my ticket: shake shake shrimp, a.k.a. an excellent take on the Chinese American classic orange shrimp.Executive chef Lucas Sin\u2019s goal is for the restaurant to carry on the legacies and techniques\u2014like velveting and egg drop\u2014developed by Chinese people living and cooking in the United States for over 150 years. In his mind, that is authentic. \u201cIt\u2019s just authentic to a community and to a culture that isn\u2019t in China itself,\u201d he says. \u201cOur job, opening a restaurant like this, is to stay faithful to our understanding of this regional cuisine.\u201dWhile conceived before the pandemic, Nice Day is certainly a child of our current crisis. According to Sin, many of the Chinese takeout joints across the U.S. lost business not just because of COVID-19 closures but because of the associated anti-Asian and anti-Chinese sentiments. Combine this with a wave of Chinese restaurant owners retiring and you have another crisis on your hands\u2014a whole cuisine in mass decline. Sin hopes to \u201cdouble-down\u201d on making and serving Chinese American food \u201cthe way it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d To the chef, that means a menu full of fresh takes on old favorites, perfected for this new era of takeout and delivery.My chicken wings, an order ubiquitous to most Chinese restaurants across the country, arrived encased in an impossibly light batter. \u201cIt\u2019s just salt, garlic, and onion,\u201d says Sin, upon further interrogation. \u201cNo funny tricks here.\u201d The kung pao chicken packed a perfectly spicy and peanutty punch. The beef chow mein was loaded with a rainbow of fresh bell peppers and bean sprouts and the chewiest egg noodles I\u2019ve ever eaten. And the mapo tofu was rich, thick, and laced with tingly Sichuan peppercorns.Then came the wildcard: shake shake shrimp. The crunchy little nuggets are fried in the same barely-there coating as the wings and delivered with a sauce\u2014orange, General Tso\u2019s, or sweet and sour\u2014on the side. The idea, as you may have guessed, is that the sauce is poured on top of the piping shot shrimp and shaken up right before eating. Why? \u201cBecause I love when crispy food is delivered crispy,\u201d Sin says, of America's favorite texture.As someone who is not only not-Chinese, but also not-American ( \ud83d\udc28), what I can say is that everything at Nice Day is delicious. Towards the end of our meal, the friend I had over for my living room floor picnic eyed our almost-empty paper box of shrimp, looked back at me, and demanded: \u201cHow is this so good?\u201d\u00a0Sin is not only making exceptional food but honoring the generations before him while building a restaurant for the future. Starting a new restaurant in a pandemic may seem like a gamble, but maybe it\u2019s for the best that sometimes the path chooses us.
