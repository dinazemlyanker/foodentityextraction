Up next, Santigold, the genre-bending musician who balances motherhood with monthly performances and always gets us on the dance floor.A lot has changed for musician Santigold since releasing her genre-bending debut album, Santogold, a decade ago. The 42-year-old, who has since launched three additional studio albums\u2014including last summer\u2019s dancehall-style I Don\u2019t Want: The Goldfire Sessions\u2014has moved from her homebase of Brooklyn to sunny Los Angeles, and is now mom to a four-year-old son and eight-month-old fraternal twins. \u201cAll I think about is that one day, I\u2019ll have a vacation,\u201d she says with that new-mom-exhausted laugh. But that doesn\u2019t mean the music has stopped. Santigold, whose iconic indie-electro-pop-rock-dance style is impossible to categorize, still performs for her devoted fans monthly, though the days of not spending a night in her own bed for months on end are over at least for now. \u201cI leave for two or three days at a time now,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m juggling a lot.\u201dWellness has always been a part of Santi\u2019s life\u2014she even climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in 2010 (that\u2019s what we call ~ peak ~ wellness). But now she incorporates it in lower-elevation doses. Here\u2019s how the musician-producer-mom-chocoholic brings sanity to her daily life.My perfect morning involves... A little bit of alone time. I have a house in Jamaica, but I haven\u2019t been in quite a while. When I\u2019m there, I eat breakfast on the deck overlooking a rainforest with a bird sanctuary, and the ocean is in the distance. That\u2019s my idea of a perfect morning, but right now, a typical morning is waking up between 6 and 7:30 after having just been up at 5:30, trying to get my four-year-old off to school, pumping for the twins, and scrambling through emails. It\u2019s 12pm and I still haven\u2019t eaten breakfast.My dream evening is\u2026 Being in my own house, lying in my bed and watching a movie or Game of Thrones. I am a very, very late Game of Thrones fan\u2014I watched it last year from start to finish because when I was pregnant, I couldn\u2019t move. I started and finished it before the babies arrived.My drink of choice is\u2026 I try not to do caffeine because it affects me a lot, but I make this tea with raspberry leaves, nettle, and alfalfa. I grab handfuls of each loose tea, boil it, and strain it all together. It\u2019s really delicious and good for you\u2014I drank it every day for a year. My friend who is a naturalist and a veteran mom made it for me years ago, and then I started making it and everyone in the house started drinking it. Every time I would make it, it would be gone immediately.I stay healthy on the road by\u2026 Always taking vitamins. Dr. Schulze SuperFood vitamins are my go-to if I feel like I need to push my immune system to be a little stronger. They also make an Echinacea Plus that\u2019s great. When you\u2019re on tour, your voice is your instrument, and if you don\u2019t keep up your body, it goes.The secret to hotel breakfasts is\u2026 Oatmeal\u2014it\u2019s a good, stable breakfast. I hate eggs and stick to a pescatarian diet, so American breakfast can be hard for me. I don\u2019t want to eat pancakes or waffles everyday. But put some berries in oatmeal, and you know you\u2019ll have a good breakfast.I can\u2019t get enough of\u2026 Dark chocolate covered mangoes. A friend of mine brought some back from the Philippines. They were amazing, but she said that you couldn\u2019t get them anywhere other than in the Philippines. I am a genius at finding things on the web, so I told her that I would find them, but I really couldn\u2019t find them anywhere! Turns out, the one place that makes them here is Costco\u2019s Kirkland. They\u2019re actually sourced from the Philippines. They are delicious and I order them from Amazon all the time.I quiet the noise in my head by\u2026 Meditating. I studied Qigong meditation, and it\u2019s amazing\u2014it\u2019s the best for keeping me grounded, calm, focused and connected. And, honestly, I love movies. When I\u2019m really tired and my brain is dead, I like to watch romantic comedies. The ones you\u2019ve seen over and over, like Sleepless in Seattle or You\u2019ve Got Mail.I am the happiest when\u2026 I am able to be present in the moment and enjoy what I\u2019m doing. There are so many things that bring me joy, whether that\u2019s spending time with my family, making music, swimming, or being in nature. I recently moved to LA from Brooklyn, so now I just look at the palm trees and am happy.Good, healthy collaboration means\u2026 Stepping outside of your comfort zone, approaching things from a different angle, and trying something new. The most exciting collaborations come from something you wouldn\u2019t have created by yourself.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
