We got you. Welcome to Happy Hour with Al, a monthly column where Al Culliton, Basically\u2019s resident bartender, sets you up to get the most bang for your booze with the fewest possible bottles.Ever wonder when all of your relatives started bringing their signature dishes to holiday parties? Great Aunt Gloria\u2019s green bean casserole didn\u2019t just materialize out of thin air one year. At some point, it was year one for that casserole. She had to decide to make it a thing. And guess what? It\u2019s time you start your own tradition: making the best eggnog anyone in your family has ever had. Like many old-school holiday dishes, eggnog has, in the minds of many, been relegated to the same undesirable category as fruitcake (which, by the way, is delicious when made properly). But this is just plain wrong! It tastes great, like melted ice cream, and is highly appropriate for wintry celebrations.But how did eggnog get to be a major holiday institution in the first place? I\u2019m glad you asked. Drinks similar to eggnog were served in medieval England, but it wasn\u2019t until centuries later that they picked up the name we call it now. Some of eggnog\u2019s earliest iterations were posset\u2014a milk-and-ale (or wine) drink made more enticing with the addition of honey, spices, or citrus\u2014and flips and purls, both very old English drinks made with eggs to create a pleasing frothy texture along with spirits and/or ale. These beverages influenced what we now know as eggnog, which took on a whole other life when it became popular in the colonial United States.Your new tradition starts now, so get yourself to the store.Your Shopping ListYou'll need all of the ingredients for the base, and booze and spices depending on which of the three variations you choose.For all versions:EggsWhole milkHeavy creamSugarFor the classic:Brandy (Bertoux)Aged rum (Appleton 12)Rye whiskey (Wild Turkey)NutmegFor the old-fashioned:Oloroso sherry (Lustau or Colosia)Madeira (Henriques & Henriques)Whole nutmegAllspice (optional)For the cool-kid version:Mezcal (Vida or Sombra)Cr\u00e8me de cacao (Tempus Fugit is best)Cinnamon stickCocoa powder1. Make the BaseWe\u2019re going to make an all-purpose eggnog base, and then you\u2019ll have a choice of three fun variations. The inherently enjoyable character of eggnog can be weighed down if you\u2019re not careful. I love this recipe from a few years back by BA\u2019s own Amiel Stanek. This recipe adds fluffy egg whites just before serving, giving the whole thing an element of lightness. We also find it to be a fitting foundation for a variety of different spirits.Here\u2019s how you make it: Separate 6 eggs into yolks and whites. Whisk yolks, 1 cup sugar (if you\u2019re making our Mezcal eggnog, reduce sugar by \u00bd cup, we\u2019ll explain later), and a pinch of salt in a large punch bowl until sugar is dissolved. Gradually whisk in 3 cups whole milk and 2 cups heavy cream. This is the part where you choose your booze\u2014peek below. After that, we\u2019ll let the eggnog meld and then wrap up with the final step. Hint: It involves those egg whites you set aside!2. Choose Your BoozeA Classic \u2018NogBrandy and rum were staples of early American drinking. But as time went on, domestically-produced whiskey started to gain favor. So our \u201cclassic\u201d recipe is a sort of snapshot of a couple hundred years back, with rye whiskey (which George Washington included in his own recipe), Cognac, and rum. Stir \u00bd cup aged rum, \u00bd cup Cognac, and \u00bd cup rye into your base, then cover and chill for at least two hours. After the last step, see step 3 below, garnish with freshly grated nutmeg.Super Old-FashionedPhoto by Laura MurrayI\u2019m a big fan of fortified wines, and so were the Americans of the early Republic. To keep wine from spoiling on its way from Portugal and Spain to England and, later, America, wines were \u201cfortified\u201d with the addition of alcohol. This eggnog is a little lower ABV because wine replaces the liquor, and, as such, is less expensive to make. Go for a 1 cup nice, nutty oloroso sherry and 1 cup medium-dry Madeira. Stir those into your base. Cover the \u2018nog and put it in the fridge for a minimum of two hours. When it\u2019s garnish time, nutmeg works well here again, and just a bit of allspice performs well, too. I\u2019m two-hundred years old, so this is my favorite version of eggnog.The Cool-Kid NogPhoto by Laura MurrayThis one is for all you lovers of Mezcal (I also fall in that category). In this context, it pairs beautifully with another notable product of Mexico: chocolate. A really good cr\u00e8me de cacao is a thing of beauty, providing a rich base note to your cocktails and your eggnog. Use 1\u00bc cups Mezcal and \u2153 cup cr\u00e8me de cacao. Stir those into your base, then cover and chill the mixture for at least two hours. After the final step, garnish with cocoa powder and freshly grated cinnamon. Don\u2019t think this is too innovative for your relatives: After the first sip, they\u2019ll be clamoring for you to bring it again next year.3. Seal the DealOnce you choose your booze, mix it into your eggnog base, cover, and chill at least 2 hours. When you\u2019re ready to serve, beat the reserved egg whites in a medium bowl, either by hand or with an electric mixer, until stiff peaks form. Gently fold half of egg whites into eggnog. Once almost incorporated, gently fold in other half. Garnish appropriately for your chosen version.Can\u2019t you just picture it? Family holiday party, where your beautiful bowl of eggnog is right there next to the shrimp cocktail and the decorative cheese ball. And there\u2019s a glass in every hand and you\u2019re getting so many compliments! You\u2019re converting eggnog skeptics into eggnog believers, and isn\u2019t that what the holidays are all about?Al Culliton is a writer, bartender and consultant living in western Massachusetts.
