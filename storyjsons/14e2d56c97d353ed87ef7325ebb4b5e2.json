That\u2019s just how good (and bountiful) senior food editor Andy Baraghani\u2019s new chorizo and potato stew is.It\u2019s the thing I want to eat all winter when it\u2019s bleak and already dark at 4 p.m. It hits all the right notes\u2014spice that warms you from the inside! Rich, complex flavors! A touch of acid!\u2014with heat from a sprinkle of cayenne and a lot of paprika, nubbins of salty Spanish-style chorizo, creamy potatoes, tangy sour cream, and a hit of fresh dill.And it\u2019s also the thing you cook all winter, because this recipe is a) incredibly fast to make, b) stupid simple (it\u2019s mostly just cut, dump, and wait), and c) can easily feed a whole football team\u2014or just you for, like, a week.This recipe comes together in just 45 minutes, including cutting all the ingredients and cooking the stew. That\u2019s because Andy built it from flavor bombs, like bacon and chorizo, that do a lot of the heavy lifting for you (and your stove). \u201cThe chorizo gives it a back bone and so much depth, so it doesn\u2019t need to go on for hours and hours,\u201d Andy says. Smart guy.Another shortcut Andy recommends to add a lot of flavor with literally zero effort? Adding a hefty spoonful of sauerkraut and a little of the brine right to your bowl. \u201cI really liked the idea of adding pickled veg, definitely something I got from Bar Tartine [in San Francisco],\u201d Andy explains. \u201cBut you can add whatever you want\u2014even white kimchi\u2014and then eat it night after night after night.\u201dWhich you should. All winter long.Get the recipe:Chorizo and Potato StewThis is the hearty, rustic, and deeply warming comfort food you'll be craving on all snowy days.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titRecipeWinterStewRead MorecookingWhat\u2019s Better Than Chicken Stew?
