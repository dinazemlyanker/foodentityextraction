He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.On the latest episode of the Bon App\u00e9tit podcast, we got into it about corn.Our pal Gabe T. was telling Carla Lalli Music and me about how he chided his sister-in-law for ordering an ear of corn at a Long Island chowder house over July 4th weekend.\u201cJill\u2014that corn\u2019s not local.\u201dJill laser-eyed him. \u201cOh really, Gabe\u2014it\u2019s not \u2018local\u2019?\u201d air quotes firmly in place.Not to get too food preachy (because, honestly, who\u2019s going to listen to a guy who drinks his beer on ice)? but Gabe\u2019s right. Corn, like tomatoes, is one of those things you can\u2019t rush.Want this letter before it hits the website?

It\u2019s been sitting in a refrigerated 18-wheeler for how long?Quality, in-season corn doesn\u2019t hit the northeast (where we here at BA live) until right about now. And suddenly, for a couple of months, it\u2019s everywhere.The first thing I\u2019m doing, after sourcing the best I can find\u2014husks that hug the ears, shiny silk, tightly bunched kernels\u2014is plunging them into well salted, rapidly boiling water in the biggest pot I own. And for only a few minutes.Ripe, fresh-picked corn is so tender and sweet, you can (and should) eat it raw, whether in a salsa or salad. So when you\u2019re boiling it, you\u2019re really just trying to get it piping hot, so that butter you\u2019re about to slather on it will get all melty.No presoaking or preshucking necessary for this salad.\nOn the grill, BA advises that you keep the husks on and lay the corn straight on the grates, no need to soak. Which I guess I\u2019m okay with. But, personally, I love shucking the ears first and then grilling, so the kernels take on a nice caramelized char, ideal for elote, the beloved Mexican corn slicked with mayo, cotija cheese, chile, and lime juice.A couple of months from now, I hope to be so tired of corn that I won\u2019t want to see it till next July\u2014at which point I won\u2019t be able to wait to get my hands on some.Get the recipe:Grilled Corn Salad with Hot Honey\u2013Lime DressingBright and light, this grilled corn salad with avocado will go with everything else at your summer barbecue.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterGrillCornRecipes you want to make.
