We\u2019re digging this top-notch spin on a traditional French Dip, created by Jacob Dixon at Mean Sandwich. The crew created this stellar recipe that\u2019s prepared with housemade roast beef, sauteed mushrooms and butter pickles on homemade bread with a perfect layer of NEW, deliciously creamy Heinz\u00ae Mayonnaise. And of course, it\u2019s served with an au jus side for dipping.PrintIngredientsFor the jus2 pounds beef knuckle bonesKosher salt, freshly ground black pepperFor the roast beef 1 tablespoon kosher salt1 1/2 teaspoons sugar1 teaspoon ground black pepper1 teaspoon shichimi togarashi (found in Japanese grocery stores; substitute with 2 teaspoons orange zest, 3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1/2 teaspoon black sesame seeds)2 tablespoons olive oil1-3 pounds beef top round roast, tied and at room temperatureFor the pickles 6 Persian cucumbers, thinly sliced into roundsKosher salt1 tablespoon yellow mustard seeds1 teaspoon red chili flakes1 teaspoon turmeric2 cups distilled white vinegar1 cup sugarFor the sandwich 6 tablespoons unsalted butter1 small onion, thinly sliced1 pound oyster mushrooms, trimmedKosher saltSliced roast beef, for servingHeinz\u00ae Mayonnaise, for serving8 buns, split2 cups fris\u00e9eRecipe PreparationFor the jus Preheat oven to 450\u00b0. Roast bones in oven until caramelized, turning occasionally, about 30 minutes. Transfer bones to a medium stock pot, cover with 8 cups water, and bring to a boil. Simmer bones on medium-low, uncovered, until the broth is reduced by three-quarters, about 2 1/2 hours. Season with salt and pepperFor the roast beef Preheat oven to 375\u00b0. Whisk together salt, sugar, black pepper, and togarashi in a small bowl. Rub beef with salt mixture and oil. Transfer beef roast in roasting pan and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 120\u00b0, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer roast to a cutting board and let rest 15 minutes before removing kitchen twine and slicing.To slice the beef, use a very sharp slice knife or deli slicer, and cut very thin slices of roast beef. Divide sliced beef into 8 portions.For the pickles Toss cucumbers and 2 teaspoons salt in a large bowl; let stand 30 minutes. Drain and squeeze well to remove as much excess moisture as possible. Transfer salted cucumbers into a large glass jar and add mustards seeds, turmeric, and chili flakes. Bring vinegar, sugar, and 1 cup water to a boil in a medium saucepan, stirring to dissolve sugar. Remove from heat and let cool. Carefully pour into jar, filling all the way to the top. Seal jar and chill at least 1 day.Sandwich Assembly Melt 4 tablespoons butter in large skillet over medium.
