Get Your Wine Glass Filled to the Brim.The \u201cJoan\u201d is an off-menu inside joke, and the best wine deal in town.\u00a0By Alex BeggsDecember 23, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Laura MurrayFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.The standard restaurant wine pour is five ounces. It puddles in the bottom of the glass like yesterday\u2019s rainfall. It costs close to as much as the entire bottle retails for. This is a widely accepted truth.But is it enough?Most of the time, sure! But in an amber-glowing Champagne bar in New York City, you can have much, much more.At The Riddler, which has a new location in the West Village (the original is in SF), you can order a \u201cJoan,\u201d off-menu. You can choose bubbles, white, or red. The bottles vary from day to day, but there\u2019s no such thing as bad wine at this place. The waiter will pour the wine into your glass, and pour, and pour, and pour...until the surface tension of the wine vibrates slightly. Any more and it would overflow. Laugh, lean forward, and sip.The Joan is a caricature. An inside joke about a \u201cfun-time suburban mom\u201d from the childhood of owner Jen Pelka\u2019s friend\u2014perhaps you know a version of Joan. She showed up to the kids\u2019 soccer game with a flask of cheap white wine. \u201cWe have so many guests who tell us that their aunt is named Joan, and that she drinks her wines Joan-style,\u201d said Pelka.But here the Joan takes the clich\u00e9 about \u201cmom wine\u201d to a hyperbolic and satirical place, like that Amy Schumer sketch with the gigantic wine glass. (At a restaurant funded solely by female investors, you might see it as another level of the bar\u2019s implicit feminism.) But it\u2019s also a GREAT DEAL. $16 for two and a half glasses of wine!When I stopped in for oysters and a (very good, BTW) burger recently, I had the red Joan, a juicy Chilean pinot noir. (People don\u2019t usually bother to even ask what the wine is, though, it\u2019s more about the spectacle.) The sight of my 100 percent full glass inspired my jealous and thrifty dinner mate to order the Joan bubbles, which were big popping bubbles of cava\u2014the perfect companion to the cheesy burger. \u201cThere\u2019s a two-Joan maximum, FYI,\u201d warned the waiter. Joan is more than half a bottle of wine. Makes sense.This is a bar where caviar comes with Lay\u2019s potato chips, where you can have pristine crudo before a burger and fries, and wash it down with obscure expensive Champagne or a pony of High Life. The atmosphere is light-hearted and fun and keeps the whole \u201cChampagne bar\u201d thing from getting too stuffy, which is Pelka\u2019s mission. There\u2019s a ginormous bottle of Krug in the bathroom behind emergency glass. Don\u2019t think too hard about it\u2014order a Joan.Go there: The RiddlerExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendWineNew YorkRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
