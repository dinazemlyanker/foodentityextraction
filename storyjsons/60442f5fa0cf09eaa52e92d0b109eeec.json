It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.The truth about my refrigerator is that even when it\u2019s empty, it\u2019s full \u2026 of condiments. There's a reason for that besides the fact that most of them will never go bad, and because I believe a girl can\u2019t have too many hot sauces. Condiments are the razzle dazzle that make all of my meals\u2014even the super quick and not very inventive ones\u2014feel properly accessorized and worthy of the yum-yum noises I expect my family to make when they eat my food. Yes, I include basics like mayo and mustard, Crystal hot sauce, Sriracha, and miso paste. But there are a few others that have graduated into the almost-daily rotation. Here\u2019s my condiment clique and how I like to show them off.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Prepared HorseradishWhat delivers wasabi-level nose tingles along with the pucker of a full-sour pickle? Horseradish, that\u2019s what. I just look at the bottle and the phrase \u201ca little dab\u2019ll do ya\u201d pops into my head. Mix it into sour cream or Greek yogurt with a lot of black pepper and big pinch of kosher salt and it\u2019s the dollop you want next to steak, roasted sweet potatoes, chicken thighs, or a bag of potato chips. Stir it into pan drippings from cooking a pork chop or chicken cutlet along with a splash of water, some lemon juice and butter and you\u2019ve got a horseradish jus. It can be served as is next to braises (think: brisket) or long-roasted pork shoulder. I also love it on a sandwich with bread, softened butter, and ham.Buy it:Atomic Extra Hot Horseradish, $13 on AmazonKelchner\u2019s Horseradish, from $18 for a 3-pack at kelchnershorseradish.comThere's always kimchi on toast!\nPhoto by Chelsea Kyle, Food Styling by Susie TheodorouKimchiI\u2019ve eaten a lot of cabbage on quarantine. But you know what\u2019s better than cabbage? Spicy fermented Korean cabbage, that\u2019s what. Kimchi is on every grocery list I ever write\u2014along with good bread and cold brew, it is an item that I would not, and shall not live without. It\u2019s technically a banchan, or side dish, but I treat it like an all-purpose go-with for just about any meal. It lands on the table more meals than not, draped over whichever protein we\u2019re having, from roast turkey to fried eggs. It ends up in all of the grain bowls, from the healthyish ones with farro and lentils, to the quasi-Mexican ones with black beans, rice, and shredded cheese. Speaking of cheese, it is amazing chopped up and layered into a grilled cheese, and kimchi juice makes a pretty great tequila chaser. I made an emergency taco with leftover sweet potatoes and kimchi the other day for a very late lunch and let\u2019s just say\u2014would eat again.Buy it: Sunja\u2019s Kimchi, from $4 at sunjaskimchi.comGreen hot sauceIt\u2019s hard to describe the sensation of green hot sauce compared to red, and I love them both, but it\u2019s sort of like I feel red hot sauce on the tip of my tongue, and green hot sauce shows up in the meaty part of my cheek. The one I\u2019m obsessed with right now is a habanero sauce from El Yucateco. It is bright, it is very picante but very fruity, and my bottle is dangerously low. I\u2019m going to have to hide it behind some half-squeezed tubes of tomato paste in the fridge while I work on finding a replacement. I will mix this with buttermilk to make a marinade for chicken or pork, and I\u2019ll add it to a salsa verde if I don\u2019t have fresh chiles on hand, and it can also be combined with mayo to make a spicy creamy sauce. If you\u2019re looking for something similar, I also love the green Tabasco, and green hot sauce from Melinda\u2019s (both are milder and made with jalape\u00f1os).Buy them:El Yucateco Chile Habanero, from $12 on AmazonTabasco Green Pepper Sauce, $5 at foodsofnations.comMelinda\u2019s Classic Jalapeno Pepper Sauce, $6 at foodofnations.comPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesPepperonciniNothing makes me salivate like looking at a jar of pepperoncini. So sour! So spicy! So squidgy, but in a good way! Pepperoncini (or banana peppers, if that\u2019s what your store has) complete any antipasto board and are MVPs in Italian-style chopped salad, but they also end up in my tuna salad, my grain salads, and my salad salads. I put them on salami sandwiches and quesadillas. I prefer the whole ones to the pre-sliced ones, but will not make a big deal about it if sliced is all I can get.Buy it: Mezzetta Pepperoncini, $13 at mezzetta.comMarina SauceFull disclosure: Tutto Calabria\u2019s Marina Sauce is not easy to find. I had the good fortune of picking up a jar a couple of weeks before stay-at-home orders went into effect. I cannot get enough of this stuff, but I also cannot get more till this is over, so I have to be careful how I use it! It\u2019s got all the red chile heat and delicious oily texture of the original calabrian chile paste, but with tiny little fishes mixed in! It\u2019s the perfect blend of fiery and funky, more oily than vinegary, and hot like a Sicilian summer. I love it on crackers with butter and jarred anchovies, it\u2019s awesome flicked all over a mozzarella and tomato salad, it\u2019s indispensable on pan pizza night, and you can cool it down with some yogurt and use that as a bed for roasted or boiled potatoes. Mamma mia!Buy it (at some point): Tutto Calabria Rose Marina, $8 at supermarketitaly.comRemember, condiments are great because they round up many ingredients into one efficient delivery system (jar, bottle, or tub). You can keep everything simple with your technique and the rest of your meal, and let the condiment be the disco ball that turns dinner into a party. A party in your mouth, of course.All products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
