When something\u2019s so easy you don\u2019t need one. In It\u2019s That Simple, we\u2019ll talk you through the dishes and drinks we make with our eyes closed. Today, Halloumi fries.For some people, mozzarella sticks are \u201chaving a moment.\u201d For others, it\u2019s been mozz sticks all along. \u201cI think mozzarella sticks are trending right now,\u201d says Kat Turner, executive chef and co-owner of Highly Likely Caf\u00e9 in L.A., \u201cbut for me, they were always number one.\u201d And when Turner was thinking about menu additions to complement the caf\u00e9\u2019s natural wine program, fried cheese sticks were the logical addition. Only, she wanted something gluten-free with no breading involved and with all the salty fattiness came from the ingredient itself.Her answer? Halloumi fries. A semi-firm Cypriot cheese traditionally made of goat\u2019s and sheep\u2019s milks, Halloumi has a high melting-point, meaning it\u2019s perfectly suited for grilling, pan-frying, and deep-frying, which, thanks to the all-around heat and fat, results in the most dramatic contrast between soft interior and crusty outer edges. While you can dredge Halloumi, you don\u2019t need to: \u201cIf you deep-fry Halloumi, you get a lot of those delicious qualities of mozzarella sticks without breading. It gets a craggy, crackly, golden brown crust on the outside with a soft, squeaky texture on the inside.\u201dBecause Halloumi is commonly brined in salt water, it\u2019s also flavorful to the core, so there\u2019s no need to season the cheese before or after cooking. Simply slice it into batons, pat dry, drown in hot oil, and serve warm while the interiors are creamy-melty and the exteriors crisp. (For all of its dairy-rich glory, mozzarella skews bland, leaning on heavily seasoned breading and/or tangy marinara sauce for assistance.)Here\u2019s how to make Halloumi fries:At Highly Likely, Turner is \u201cblessed with a deep-fryer,\u201d but it\u2019s easy enough to fry at home as long as you have a large heavy-bottomed pot, a bottle of oil, and the patience to let it get up to temperature. (I did it\u2014multiple times\u2014and lived to tell the tale!) To get frying, heat 1\" neutral oil (like canola or vegetable) to 350\u00b0F in a large heavy-bottomed pot with high sides (it\u2019s even better if it\u2019s nonstick, but a Dutch oven will also do). The high sides are important\u2014the cheese is bound to sputter when it hits the hot fat\u2014as is the oil\u2019s temperature: Too cool and it might get greasy; too hot and it might brown before warming through.As your oil is heating, slice one 8-ounce package Halloumi in half, like a burger bun, so that you have two thinner slabs. Cut each half into four long batons (about 4x\u00bd\"). Pat dry with paper towels or a clean kitchen towel. Carefully add the cheese to the hot oil, standing back to avoid spatter. Fry, turning occasionally if necessary, until deeply golden brown on all sides, 2\u20133 minutes total. Transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly and voil\u00e0: Just like that, Halloumi fries have joined the ranks of great cooked cheeses, from oozy, pastry-ensconced baked Brie to Greek saganaki to paneer tikka to the regional specialty of Turner\u2019s home state of Wisconsin: squeaky fried cheese curds.Once you get a taste for fried Halloumi, you\u2019ll look for any opportunity to eat more of it. At Highly Likely, Turner adds fried slabs to a focaccia sandwich with Kewpie mayo, house-made harissa, and an herby arugula salad. She also serves it showered with roughly chopped tender herbs atop a pool of hot honey sauce\u2014quite simply, equal parts honey (a natural companion to the salty cheese) and the caf\u00e9\u2019s house-made fermented Fresno chile hot sauce. Feel free to use whatever hot sauce you please and to serve the mixture on the side, for dipping, or artfully zigzagged over top. At my house, I\u2019ve found myself doing something decidedly less inspired. I drizzle the cheese with honey, grind over some black pepper, and hit it with a little Boonville Barn chile powder before it even makes it to the table.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimpleRecipes you want to make.
