And the thing is, I actually use all of them, from my fish spatula (pancakes!) to my offset spatula (frosting a cake!). I get strangely attached to my spatulas\u2014and wooden spoons for that matter\u2014they are like my kitchen children, each with their own special skill and traits.But if I had to start voting spatulas off the island, I know that my\u00a0 silicone GIR mini-spatula would be one of the last ones standing. It doesn't bend too much like a lot of the rubber ones do, and it's just the right size (about 8 inches long) for a range of tasks from stirring a pot of rice to scooping the last remains of cake batter from the bowl.Most important, it's the only spatula I'll use for scrambled eggs; it perfectly shapes the eggs into the fluffy mass I crave. It's dishwasher-safe, but is also really easy to hand-wash, unlike a few other of my spatulas which will remain nameless. In short, it's sturdier than any other spatula I own, yet still giving the right amount of bend.I've had this spatula for years, and it looks as good as new. I've freaked out when I couldn't find it because my husband accidentally put it in the wrong place. And after our staff photographer shot the photo above, I sort of frantically got in touch with the photo team to ensure that I would get it back soon\u2014I might have even used the phrase \"I just wanted to keep track of my spatula that I love dearly.\"So here's where it gets really weird. For my bachelorette party two years ago, I wanted to give my friends a small gift as a thank-you for traveling to a cabin in upstate New York for the weekend. I ended up buying the GIR mini-spatula in all the colors. Everyone got a spatula! And thus, my bachelorette hashtag was born: #spatularette.GIR Mini Silicone Spatula$15 $13 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titWere Into ItToolsShoppingRead MorecultureThe Perfect Dish Rack for (Very) Small KitchensBy Alex BeggstechniquesPre-Cut Parchment Paper Keeps Me From Losing My MindBy Emma WartzmanRecipes you want to make.
