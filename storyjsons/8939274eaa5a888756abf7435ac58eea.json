After my most recent trip though, I realized that was ignorant. That\u2019s because San Diego is home to the place where I had one of my favorite meals of this year: at El Jard\u00edn.I can\u2019t think of a single thing I disliked about my experience at the hyper-regional Mexican restaurant, overseen by the bold, endlessly energetic chef Claudette Zepeda Wilkins. We sat in a large outdoor patio with heat lamps. Half an hour into the meal, a server saw that I was still chilly and brought out a big, colorful blanket. My friends and I drank a bottle of red from Bichi winery in Tecate that tasted like funk and cranberries. And the food! Fideos secos that are the most addictive plate of garlic noodles you\u2019ve ever had. Tlacoyos with cheese fondue, hoja santa, and broccoli that taste like inhaling a garden. Even the guacamole\u2014a clich\u00e9 at many Mexican restaurants\u2014was crafted with care: fruity, smoky, and slightly spicy all at once. And best of all? The basket of warm tortillas was constantly being replenished. Even by California standards, this Mexican food was unforgettable.Perhaps the only thing I dislike about this restaurant is that I live in New York...and there aren\u2019t enough direct flights to San Diego.Go there: El Jard\u00ednExplore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsCaliforniaMexicanHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make.
