When something\u2019s so easy to make that you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.Endless time at home offers little to look forward to. Another round of Cards Against Humanity, which, I have learned the hard way, is not a two-player game. The last passion fruit La Croix, left over from a mixed pack. The feeling of warm laundry fresh from the dryer. But, after a long day, there is one activity I truly relish: The slow post-dinner shuffle from table to couch, into which I sink, both wired and exhausted, with my favorite dessert. It\u2019s a three-ingredient Nutella brownie, cut into nine bite-size squares that I can pop into my mouth like they\u2019re plump grapes and I\u2019m a slovenly Greek goddess.Speaking of lazy, I found the recipe flicking through Sabrina Snyder\u2019s new cookbook, Dinner Then Dessert, which appealed to me because all of the comfort food recipes\u2014like Tomato-Balsamic Pulled Pork, Slow Cooker (!) Spaghetti and Meatballs, and S\u2019mores Cups (OMG)\u2014call for just three, five, or seven ingredients. Unlike many of my colleagues (don\u2019t tell them, okay?), who will toil in the kitchen for hours making elaborate baked goods like the good food editors they are, I would much rather buy a jumbo Toblerone and call it a night. But the brownies? They\u2019re made from only flour, Nutella, and eggs\u2014and take 40 minutes max, including bake time.Dinner Then Dessert$30 $22 at AmazonLike earth\u2019s layers, they\u2019re a textural masterpiece: crispy-crackly crust, chewy mantle, and rich, fudgy core. Imagine a spoonful of Nutella, but doughier. And handheld. And equally impossible to stop eating. They\u2019re satisfying, impressive, and better than anything I could buy\u2014or coax from the dusty boxes of brownie mix I\u2019ve had in the cupboard since 2014. Better yet, one batch makes 16 jumbo or 20 average-size brownies, which means I always have a stockpile in the fridge. My little cubes of hope, joy, salvation, SUGAR!Here\u2019s how to make them:Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F. Line a 9x13\" baking dish with parchment paper and then spray with baking spray. (Helpful hint: I also sprayed my baking dish before lining it with the parchment paper to help stick it down.) If this feels like a BIG pan for brownies, trust the process. It\u2019ll all work out in the end.Add 5 eggs to a large mixing bowl and whisk them together. Be careful to entirely remove the foil top on a 26.5 oz jar of Nutella before microwaving it for 30 seconds to a minute, which helps melt the spread and make it easier to work with. Add the Nutella to the eggs, scraping out the jar with a little spatula, and mix until fully incorporated. (A set of electric beaters worked like a treat here.) Add 1 cup all-purpose flour and lightly mix until no streaks are visible.Pour your Nutella batter into a baking dish. At this point I went rogue and added a sprinkle of kosher salt all over the top (highly recommend) before transferring the brownies to the oven. Bake them for 22\u201324 minutes. To test their readiness: stick a toothpick into the middle. If it comes out clean, they\u2019re done. If not, put them back in for another 2\u20133 minutes. Let cool completely before dividing (and subdividing) to your preferred brownie size.While the idea of forking into a still-warm brownie sounds incredibly romantic, my preferred way of eating these squares of joy is straight from the fridge. After fully chilling out, they\u2019re harder and chewier\u2014like actual fudge\u2014and the flavors seem richer. You can store your leftovers in the fridge for up to a week, or in the freezer for God knows how long (about three months). Bust one out whenever you need a little jolt of happiness\u2014or anytime you think to yourself, Wow, it sure would be nice to go out for a change.\u00a0Oh, and look at that! I finished my last Nutella brownie while typing this.
