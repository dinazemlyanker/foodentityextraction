RossMay 22, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Susie Theodorou, Prop Styling by Nidia CuevaFacebookTwitterEmailThere is no season more intoxicating than summer, and it\u2019s not because we all have that one friend with a pool, porch, or roof. It\u2019s because long afternoons of hot concrete and wet grass melt into longer evenings of meaty smoke plumes and salty air; so many aromas, textures, and \u201cfeels\u201d coming together at once. You want a white, a rose\u0301, a chilled red\u2014you want it all. And that\u2019s why this summer you want to check out co-fermented wines.Co-ferments are made by fermenting multiple grape varieties in one vessel. Red, white, seriously any grape can be co-fermented with another to create a new expression. But don\u2019t confuse these with blends, wines that are fermented separately, then poured together to taste, kinda like daiquiris (I\u2019m kidding!). Think of co-ferments like sunsets: slightly unpredictable because you\u2019re dealing with nature but always beautiful.Some co-ferments have higher percentages of white wine to red, like Sonoma Mountain Winery\u2019s 70 percent Chardonnay and 30 percent Merlot \u201cChar\u2019mer.\u201d Its color is the coral of that decorative plate your parents got in Sedona in the \u201990s; it tastes like punchy grapefruit juice. Sam Vinciullo\u2019s \u201cRed/White\u201d is 55 percent Merlot, 45 percent Se\u0301millon, and smells and tastes like green bell peppers stuffed with rose petals off the grill, hit with a squeeze of lime.Because these wines have qualities of both white and red\u2014juicy and high acid plus a soft tannic finish\u2014 they work everywhere from the patio to the dining room. Chill one down and hop in the pool, then serve it with salmon, grilled veg, or one of those smash burgers Rapo\u2019s always \u2019gramming. Why make tough choices about red or white? It\u2019s summer, you can have it all\u2014in one bottle.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishWinenatural wineTrendsRead MoreLifestyleKrista Scruggs Is Making the Most Exciting, Most Delicious Natural Wine Right NowBy Marissa A.
