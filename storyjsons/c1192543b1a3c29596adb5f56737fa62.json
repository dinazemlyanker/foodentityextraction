Now stores are opening all over the U.S.By Bettina MakalintalDecember 13, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by: Na KimFacebookTwitterEmailWhen Emily Hui opened the Korean corn dog spot Stix in San Francisco in late 2019, she wasn\u2019t sure how long the snack would hold people\u2019s interest. She\u2019d seen more and more Korean corn dogs in mukbangs, the video format started by Korean streamers in which they talk and eat on camera, and she\u2019d tried them on a trip abroad. But although Korean corn dogs had gained popularity across Asia, the trend was still untapped Stateside. When Stix opened, it was the first Korean corn dog shop in San Francisco. As of this summer, though, the trend was going strong, according to Hui. \u201cI really have to give credit to Instagram and social media,\u201d she says.On TikTok, the number of videos featuring Korean corn dogs rose all year, according to a representative for the platform, with #koreancorndog hitting peak usage in June and July after creator @dee.045\u2019s taste test videos went viral. The snack seems engineered for exactly this kind of video success. The state fair\u2013style corn dog is fun, sure, but Korean corn dog shops offer a plethora of options. Start with a core, whether it\u2019s all sausage, half sausage and half cheese, all cheese, two kinds of cheese, half fish cake and half cheese, and so on. Dip that filling in batter and then roll it in breadcrumbs or toppings like diced french fries, crushed ramen noodles, or crispy rice before hitting the deep fryer. The result is so crispy that you can hear the coating shatter with each bite, and the dairy-filled varieties offer classic social media bait: the cheese pull.TikTok contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.As influencers on Instagram and TikTok posted videos of themselves trying Korean corn dogs, they got customers in the doors of places like Stix. Yet Hui\u2019s previous skepticism made sense. Viral food trends are almost inescapable, but also fleeting: Dalgona coffee, though ubiquitous at the start of the pandemic, dropped off the radar in favor of the now pass\u00e9 cloud bread and feta pasta. Unlike these DIY trends, which relied on home cooks\u2019 fickle interest, the Korean corn dog can be a ready-to-eat meal\u2014especially appealing for people who fear the fryer or enjoy the novelty of buying meat-on-a-stick somewhere. They\u2019ve staked greater permanence over 2021 as they\u2019ve inspired a new niche of shops across the U.S. The heyday of Korean corn dogs on TikTok may be fading, but their brick-and-mortar boom shows their potential to become a long-lasting feature of the American snack canon.Corn dogs gained popularity as a Korean street food in the 1980s, but the current corn dog trend\u2014which sees more than just hot dogs coated in more than just cornmeal batter\u2014is generally credited to Myungrang Hot Dog, a chain that started in a market near Busan in 2016. In just three years, Myungrang amassed 650 stores in Korea, taking corn dogs from a street-vendor staple to a franchise darling. As social media grew the trend\u2019s global appeal, the company began its U.S. expansion in Georgia in 2018, and when it arrived in Los Angeles\u2019s Koreatown the following year, the location imposed a limit of five corn dogs per person just to keep the lines in check. Interest in Korean corn dogs in the U.S. has been steadily building since then, with a huge spike in Google Search interest in early 2021.More companies are taking advantage of the trend now. Two Hands, a Korean-style corn dog franchise, opened its first New York City location in April of this year, and it was a hit by May, says Dan Ko, the company\u2019s business development manager. \u201cEvery day, people were just lining up around the corner of Avenue A,\u201d he says, attributing that popularity to guests sharing their food on social media. When it comes to visual marketing, their corn dogs, covered in Hot Cheetos powder or crispy potatoes, \u201ccouldn\u2019t be simpler or more effective,\u201d he explains. As of September, Two Hands had 15 locations open across the country and 40 more in the works. Mochinut, a chain named for its mochi doughnuts but that also sells Korean corn dogs, is in the midst of a similar expansion; it has 46 locations in the U.S. and 72 more coming soon.Until this year, the words corn dogs may have felt somewhat retro in the country. Case in point: In 2018, the Chicago Tribune lamented, \u201cWhere have all the corn dogs gone?\u201d But this year the same newspaper reported that the famous hot dog city now has enough Korean corn dog joints that you can pick favorites. From there, it\u2019s all becoming cheesy, gooey history.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCultureLifestyleRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
