It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Ah, spring. A time of perky little peas, stampede-inducing ramps, and fat asparagus. While other people go crazy for all the pretty green things, I go crazy for potatoes. Yes, potatoes. Any minute now, the true and real, just-dug, new baby potatoes are going to show up at the market. That\u2019s when I\u2019ll treat them like pasta in this cacio e pepe riff from New York City\u2019s own Rita Sodi and Jody Willilams of the beloved restaurant Via Carota.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Hold up a second, though. Just because there\u2019s a potato at the market, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s new, so know before you go. \u201cNew potatoes are an abused and misunderstood category,\u201d writes Elizabeth Schneider in Vegetables from Amaranth to Zucchini, a book you should definitely buy. (I love how mad she sounds about it!) New potatoes are not just small potatoes\u2014they\u2019re \u201cfirst crop,\u201d picked when their foliage is still green. A bonafide spring ingredient, not cold-storage staple! Ask your farmer/shopkeeper to be sure, because they\u2019re special, and you\u2019re worth it. They have thin skins and very creamy, sweet interiors; they\u2019re young and dainty and you might be able to find very tiny ones, which are ridiculously adorable.To celebrate the new potato, don\u2019t mess with it too much. I like them steamed and then tossed with butter and salt and a fistful of chopped chives, and I will eat those straight out of the bowl with my fingers, thankyouverymuch. But if you want to frill them up a little bit, do the Sodi-Williams thing. Boil them till tender, then toss them with olive oil and grated pecorino, salt and pepper. You don\u2019t need to peel them, and in fact, you shouldn\u2019t. Their skins will pop open when you bite them, exposing sweet fluffy-creamy insides. Stupid simple, but freaking delicious.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterPotatoSpringRead MorecookingFood Tastes Better When You Shop SmarterBy Carla Lalli MusiccookingYou Say Dinner, I Say SoccaBy Carla Lalli MusiccookingThe Easiest No-Cook Side You\u2019ll Make All SeasonBy Carla Lalli MusiccookingWhite Pesto Is The Easiest Dinner You Will Make This WeekBy Emma WartzmanRecipes you want to make.
