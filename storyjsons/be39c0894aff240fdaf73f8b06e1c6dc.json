Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,I\u2019m a sucker for a good \u201cbest of\u201d list. In fact, every year around this time I wonder why I bothered consuming anything in the 11 months prior, when I could\u2019ve just waited for someone else to sift through the crap and tell me what\u2019s worth my time. But, as someone who puts daily content into the world like it\u2019s literally my job, I have a hard time pulling together \u201cbest of\u201d lists of my own. Sure, we can crunch the numbers and come up with the most popular Healthyish recipes of 2019 (you\u2019ll hear about that later this week), but when it comes to choosing my favorites, well...I love all my Healthyish children! So instead of a list of \u201cbests,\u201d I want to talk about the things we published in 2019 that, for one reason or another, I still think about all the time.I\u2019ve always wanted Healthyish to be a platform for people to tell their own stories. T. Wise\u2019s piece about his dependency on weed was one of the most honest and vulnerable things I\u2019ve read about cannabis. David Tamarkin\u2019s essay on cooking through his obsessive-compulsive disorder (and the gorgeous illustration by Daniel Salmieri) made me consider my own relationship to cooking and mental health in a new way. In her essay about vacation photos, Zan Romanoff managed to capture an entire generation\u2019s ambivalence toward documenting our lives on camera\u2014and having our lives documented by others. Every I Did the Thing column that Rachel Sugar writes makes me laugh and/or cry, but I think most often about her foray into the Wim Hof method, and the line, \u201cThere is a certain openness that comes from misery.\u201d And speaking of crying, Amiel Stanek and Lauren Schaefer\u2019s goodbye-to-New-York essay masquerading as a dinner-party guide truly did bring me to tears, and not just because they don\u2019t live six blocks up the street from me anymore.I think a lot about escaping to this tropical bubble outside of Berlin.\nPhoto by Jenny Pe\u00f1asThe headline of Alex Ronan\u2019s great reported essay (along with Jenny Pe\u00f1as\u2019s haunting photos) pops into my mind every time there\u2019s another bout of freezing rain in NYC. Profiles are tricky to write, and double profiles are near-impossible, but David Tamarkin wrote the hell out of this one. And I think about Arielle Gordon\u2019s feature on wellness at the club (ahem, the clurb) every time I order a house-made celery soda or a coconut water to sip while I dance.I love writing this newsletter so much, and I\u2019m grateful to you for reading it. I felt a lot of emotions while writing this ditty about the restaurants that define New York for me. The Healthyish Guide to Your 30s was planned months before my own thirtysomething crisis kicked in, but this essay, a version of which went out as a newsletter, was very cathartic to write and, judging by the messages I got, it hit home for you guys too.I think about this steamer all the damn time. This tumbler too.I make Chris Moroccco\u2019s miso-glazed salmon recipe so often it should have its own line item in my budget. And speaking of budgets, listen up: An entire skillet of Big Flavor Broccoli (another Morocco hit) will run you about $5 as long as you have anchovies and Parmesan on hand. The first time I made Sohla El-Waylly\u2019s squash bowls with yogurt sauce, I complained about it (so many ingredients in that sauce, so much tossing of onions)...then proceeded to make it three times in a month. And speaking of squash, some people handle the onslaught of winter with SAD lamps and antidepressants. I make Lauren Schaefer\u2019s Butternut Squash Parm.Okay, time to stop dwelling on the past and start thinking about the decade ahead...or at least those presents we still have to buy.
