I hung out with the smokers long enough to bum a cigarette as well as bum advice on the best brand of charcoal pencils. I worked on group projects with people who lived off-campus to learn the coolest bars on the Lower East Side. And my Italian roommate taught me the importance of walking a few extra blocks to get a good slice instead of 2 Bros.But most of all, I learned that busy people love to talk about how busy they are. And everyone in New York is busy\u2014supposedly that's why they walk so fast. Including me. You know the busy people, they have their phone out all the time. They say \u201cput it in my calendar!\u201d or \u201cI need a vacation after this year!\u201d But everyone has to eat to survive, so I asked a bunch of my friends with all kinds of different\u2014very busy\u2014day jobs how they do it. Here\u2019s what they had to say.Michael Graydon + Nikole HerriottJoey O\u2019BrienOccupation: Executive AssistantSince your job is busy what do you usually eat for lunch? I bring snacks from home like dried mango, wasabi peas, and blueberries to eat throughout the day, and if I do not feel satisfied, I will buy something from grab-and-go places, like Dig Inn, Roast Kitchen, or Sweetgreen. If I do buy something, it\u2019s usually some combination of protein and greens.Do you eat it as efficiently as possible, or take a real break? I take a real 40-minute break. I make sure to leave the office, even if that means eating my homemade lunch on a bench outside.Photo by Alex LauJane RosenfeldOccupation: Graduate School Student at Bank Street, getting a Master\u2019s in Elementary EducationSince your job is busy what do you usually eat for lunch? YES. My job is busy and even though there is 50 minutes given to teachers for lunch each day\u2026usually about only 5 of them are spent consuming food. The rest involves running around and planning and cleaning up clay or paper scraps or glue that spilled. So I usually pack lunch because I definitely don\u2019t have time to run out during the lunch break to get any. I usually make a sandwich, (turkey, lettuce, tomato!!!) the night before, maybe chips or a cookie (Tates is king) if I\u2019m feeling crazy?! There\u2019s a place near my school that sometimes I go to in the morning to grab a coffee or buy a sandwich or wrap. It\u2019s called Gotham and it\u2019s across the street so it\u2019s very convenient.Do you eat it as efficiently as possible, or take a real break? I definitely do not take a real break\u2026That\u2019s probably not a great thing to do but there really is no other choice? I\u2019m always working on something or talking to a student or doing something that takes away from my attention to my food. I should probably work on that\u2026Quincy MooreOccupation:  Founder & Creative Director, KnowlitaSince your job is busy what do you usually eat for lunch? My most frequent lunch spot is definitely Ludlow House\u2014aka my office\u2014and most days I order one of their salads with grilled chicken. My favorite lunch spot, though, is Lovely Day in Nolita, on Elizabeth between Prince and Spring. I order the same thing every time: fried chicken appetizer and the Pad Thai with tofu.Do you eat it as efficiently as possible, or take a real break? Enjoying a proper lunch is a luxury for me these days, and so usually it's a masterclass in efficiency (and/or insanity). Quick bites of something healthy-ish, devoured in-between calls and meetings, often in the back of cars, and always and forever coupled with excessive amounts of coffee.Rachel ParisoOccupation: NYC DogwalkerSince your job is busy what do you usually eat for lunch? I rarely (if ever) pack meals. I eat only the same few items in rotation so I don\u2019t have to really think about it. Those items are subject to change but at the moment they are Lenny and Larry\u2019s complete cookies (all flavors), mixed nuts, and kettle cooked potato chips (I\u2019m obsessed). I also frequent the Grey Dog in Chelsea for pumpkin muffins and coffee. Big Booty Bread Co. makes vegan potato and veggie empanadas that I\u2019ve recently become obsessed with.Do you eat it as efficiently as possible, or take a real break? Sometimes I have time to sit and have some coffee with my muffin at the Grey Dog in the morning. Otherwise I always eat on the go, while walking the dogs, depending on how chill the dogs are\u2026 Sometimes I eat at the dog park, but puppies end up mobbing me for food.Daniela SchiliroOccupation: Art Director for Grey GroupSince your job is busy what do you usually eat for lunch? When it comes to designing for an ad agency, we are extremely deadline driven. Because of this, my day-to-day varies and some days are much longer that others. It\u2019s entirely unpredictable. This was definitely difficult to become accustomed to at first since I am a sucker for a routine. I love a good custom salad from Sweetgreen (olives, sun dried tomatoes, chickpeas some times, grilled chicken is a must) but I also crave a pick me up (mozzarella & tomato) on ciabbata panini from Eataly or an egg sandwich or Milanese sandwich from Daily Provisions every so often. It depends how my day is going and if I can run out. Eataly is usually my go-to since my office is conveniently above it. (Yes, its a blessing and a curse)!Do you eat it as efficiently as possible, or take a real break? I do eat my lunches as efficiently as possible since I usually have afternoon meetings. Although some days it\u2019s nearly impossible to leave the office, I am a firm believe of getting up and getting some fresh air during the day and moving your body! That time for me is usually my lunch run. I realized this past year that I buy lunch in the summer way more than in the winter because of the weather! Roasted veggies, sandwiches, salads are usually my go-to packed lunches in the winter time.Hey busy people, did you know there's a Healthyish bowl at Sweetgreen?\nPhoto by Alex LauAmanda ShineOccupation: Co-founder, The SettingSince your job is busy what do you usually eat for lunch? If I\u2019m honest, sometimes lunch is an afterthought, so by 4 p.m. if we haven\u2019t already eaten, we\u2019ll order sushi from Blue Ribbon or salads from Sweetgreen for the team.  If we\u2019re able to have a lunch meeting or some extra time to step out, I love Two Hands on Church Street. It\u2019s around the corner from our office and the perfect midday treat. Their salads are so fresh and the ambiance is always clean and vibrant. I order The Brassicas Bowl [You can get the recipe for it here.]Do you eat it as efficiently as possible, or take a real break? It\u2019s nice to properly have lunch when I\u2019m able and I love places like Cafe Select or Sant Ambreous for a beautiful midday meal when the schedule allows. Lunch is a luxury sometimes and it can be the best kind of break even if it\u2019s a great pasta at your desk... just because we usually order late into the day, doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t make sure to enjoy it!Explore Bon App\u00e9titLunchRead MorecookingHow to Make a Week's Worth of Amazing Lunches in 2 HoursBy Chris Moroccocooking100 Lunch Ideas on What the Heck to Pack for WorkBy Alyse Whitneytest-kitchenThis Is the Most Substantial Lunch on the PlanetBy Alex BeggscookingThis Isn't Your Mom's Green Goddess SandwichBy Andy BaraghaniRecipes you want to make.
