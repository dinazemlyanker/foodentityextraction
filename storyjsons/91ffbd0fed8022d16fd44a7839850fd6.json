Pairing earthy, hardy leafy greens with cooling coconut milk, a hot chile, and spices gives this side dish a full range of bitter, sweet, and tingling flavors.Ingredients8 servings1cup unsweetened coconut flakes3lb. mixed hardy greens (such as Tuscan kale, curly kale, Swiss chard, and/or mustard greens; about 4 bunches)\u00bccup virgin coconut oil6garlic cloves, lightly crushed1large onion, finely chopped1red Thai or Fresno chile, thinly sliced12\" piece ginger, peeled, thinly slicedKosher salt2Tbsp. mustard seeds2tsp. ground coriander\u00bdtsp. ground turmeric2cups unsweetened coconut milk\u00bdcup coarsely chopped cilantroPreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 350\u00b0.

Perfect. This entered my Thanksgiving menu years ago and it never left. So much more depth than greens usually have. AKKWMpls, MN11/14/2021I love this traditional Indian dish which is really creamy from the coconut milk. I usually serve it with taroroot.GZ1/31/2021Made it with 2 kinds of kale and it was a big hit. Will definitely make it again. We had it with BA's Slow Roast Gochujang Chicken (with potatoes) and they paired together GREAT!MagnoliaMerSeattle, WA12/16/2020Made this tonight after a haul of mustard greens arrived in my farm share this week.   It was so satisfying and a full meal over rice, loved the spot of sweetness from the coconut at the end and the textural pop of the mustard seeds.  Will definitely be making again!ElizabethAnn15New York City6/1/2020Really delicious! Used beet greens from the garden and a jalape\u00f1o instead of the Fresno chile. Finished with lime and everyone raved about it!suecq1California 4/6/2020I decided to test this out before thanksgiving, and while I ultimately decided my 90 year-old grandparents might keel over from the shock of something so non-traditional at their table, I would highly recommend this dish for folks looking for a hearty vegan side for thanksgiving.  It's quite simple and quick to put together and very tasty.  Since I made a meal out of it, I added some leftover roasted chicken, topped with lime juice/zest and cashews, and served over rice.  It was great and def feels like a full meal even without the chicken.  If your making the recipe straight-up for thanksgiving, I would recommend some lime juice and zest to brighten it up.  Thanks for the recipe Andy, you are a treasure.
