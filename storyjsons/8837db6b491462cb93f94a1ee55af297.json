That\u2019s what we did to track down the biggest food launches and moments of the year, brought to you here.Photo Courtesy Getty Images / LMPCCharlie and the Sponsored ContentWilly Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, starring Gene Wilder, was the first\u2014and perhaps only\u2014movie to be produced by a food corporation, Quaker Oats, which launched two candy bars alongside the film\u2019s release. Willy Wonka Super Skrunch Bars and Willy Wonka Peanut Butter Oompas never made a profit, though, probably because they were basically the same flavor and not at all based on candy in the movie. Oompa oops!Cuppa CapitalismIn 1971 a mug of coffee at the newly opened Starbucks in Seattle cost a whopping\u2026nothing. The free samples seduced customers into paying $1.25 a pound (expensive!) for freshly roasted beans\u2014and maybe some spice blends and \u201cfancy oolong\u201d tea. Eventually, the store would change ownership; the mermaid mascot would lose her belly button; and Starbucks would become the latte-slinging $26.7 billion publicly traded global Goliath it is today.Photo courtesy Wanda Martinez; Marianos Hacienda 1991Margaritas 2.0Destiny struck Dallas when restaurant owner Mariano Martinez\u2019s customers complained that his margaritas weren\u2019t cold enough\u2014one of life\u2019s bigger letdowns. Inspired by the Slurpee machines at 7-Eleven, Martinez fashioned a frozen margarita maker out of a soft-serve machine, and the rest is history. Literally. The machine is in the Smithsonian. \u201cThis was my one chance in life to be somebody,\u201d Martinez told the Dallas Morning News.Photo by Bettmann / Getty ImagesYou\u2019ve Got MailFedEx was founded in 1971, and its unheard-of overnight shipping soon made it possible for anyone (with the funds) to order California citrus and Memphis barbecue overnight. By the \u201980s, \u201ca white truffle collector could call a restaurant in London or Los Angeles, Houston or Tokyo, and have his product showered over fettuccine the following evening,\u201d writes John F. Mariani in How Italian Food Conquered the World.Photo Courtesy the General Mills ArchivesChocolate VitaminsGeneral Mills bestowed the world with two \u201cvitamin-charged\u201d cereals: Count Chocula and Franken Berry, while Post gave us both Cocoa and Fruity Pebbles. Meanwhile, consumer advocates were testifying before Congress about cereal\u2019s high sugar content and lack of nutritional value. The cereal companies were like, \u201cbut vitamins!\u201d We bet you can guess who won that one.Photo Courtesy the Coca-Cola CompanyPeace, Love, CaffeineCoca-Cola debuted its \u201cI\u2019d Like to Buy the World a Coke\u201d commercial, a subtly subversive call for peace during the Vietnam War wrapped in a catchy tune that\u2019s now stuck in your head. Things are a little more overt now (see Kendall Jenner x Pepsi circa 2017).Photo Courtesy the General Mills ArchiveJust Add BeefHamburger Helper hit store shelves with perfect timing: Food prices were high due to post-Vietnam inflation, and the boxed mix helped stretch a pound of ground beef. Sales took off. But don\u2019t get us started on the four-fingered 1977-born mascot, Lefty, who still haunts our dreams.Photo Courtesy B Christopher / Alamy Stock PhotoMeanwhile, in JapanOsaka-born \u201cCup Noodles\u201d were the first instant ramen in cup form and arrived in the U.S. two years later as \u201cCup O\u2019Noodles,\u201d soon dominating the dry soup\u2013mix market. Campbell\u2019s and Lipton tried to launch their own dry soup mixes a decade later, but they were late to the party. Instant ramen was a million dollar industry by the late \u201980s with Nissin, which makes Cup Noodles, at the top. Cup Noodles inventor Momofuku Ando\u2019s name lives on at David Chang\u2019s Momofuku restaurants, which serve the opposite of instant ramen (the broth takes 8\u201310 hours to make).Photo Courtesy Retro AdArchives / Alamy Stock PhotoA Hamburglar Is BornThe year 1971 was huge for McDonald\u2019s, which changed its slogan to \u201cYou Deserve a Break Today,\u201d and introduced the Quarter Pounder as well as the characters of McDonaldland\u2014the Hamburglar, Grimace, you know \u2019em\u2014all part of an evil-brilliant ad campaign based on a study that revealed how influential children were in deciding where a family ate. (Oh! And 1971 saw the first PlayPlaces too.) The campaign also kicked off \u201cThe Big Meal.\u201d A precursor to supersizing, the order was \u201ca Big Mac, a very large order of fries, and a great big drink\u201d and arguably one small unbuttoning on America\u2019s pants.Photo Courtesy All-CladThis Old PotThe cream-of-the-crop cookware company All-Clad was founded in Pennsylvania by a metallurgist who decided to make himself a pot when he wasn\u2019t designing coins and airplane parts. The pans are a patented design of five alternating layers of bonded aluminum and stainless steel. The material can conduct heat evenly (while somehow maintaining a cool handle). Chefs and home cooks have been geeking out over All-Clad for over 50 years; reviewers at The Wirecutter and Cook\u2019s Illustrated constantly bestow the pans with their highest praises, and we at BA have called the frying pan an \u201cinvestment piece\u201d that we\u2019re buying and keeping for life.Photo by Michael KrausChart-Topping CookbooksCookbook sales were so high this year\u2014the Julia Child, post\u2013WW II effect\u2014that one newspaper hyperbolized they \u201cprobably outsold the Bible\u2026for the first time in publishing history.\u201d The top seller was the plaid-covered Better Homes and Gardens cookbook (first published in 1930), which outsold the top best-selling fiction and nonfiction books combined, with over 600,000 copies. Cookbooks published in 1971 to acclaim included: The New York Times International Cookbook, by Craig Claiborne, The Art of Armenian Cooking, by Rose Baboian, and A West African Cookbook by the celebrated journalist Ellen Wilson Gibson. Ruth Reichl published her first cookbook Mmmmm: A Feastiary, which is going for $1,003.96 on Amazon right now and whose cover featured a marching band of cartoon produce, including a lemon playing the cymbals and a watermelon on the tuba.Manly SoupHE COOKS! was the name of a recurring column in Better Homes and Gardens. (\u201cWe want recipes that YOU\u2014the man-of-the-house\u2014prepare yourself.\u201d) Men were cooking more at home, notes historian Helen Veit, even if that meant just opening a can of soup: Products like Campbell\u2019s \u201cManhandlers\u201d (the regular soups, but chunky) helped rake in the company\u2019s first billion dollars that year.How CelestialAfter selling baggies filled with homemade herb blends out of a van, as one does in the late \u201960s, the founders of Celestial Seasonings opened up headquarters in Boulder, Colorado, brewing up \u201chibiscus flowers, lemongrass, spiritualism, and capitalism,\u201d per the New York Times. They were selling tea blends, the first of their kind in a country steeped in Lipton: Red Zinger, Sleepy Time, Mellow Mint. Four year later, they passed the million dollar mark.Photo by Frank Hurley/Daily News Archive via Getty ImagesSweet, Sweet ImpeachmentAlong with its first installment of the Pentagon Papers, the New York Times published a page one story about Tricia Nixon\u2019s wedding and wedding cake, which caused a three-day investigation as food writers tried to figure out why the recipe, released by the White House, made \u201cbaked sludge.\u201dDept. of RIPThey can\u2019t all be winners. Some 1971 kitchen innovations never quite took off\u2026Roasting WrapReveal\u2019s \u201croasting wrap\u201d didn\u2019t last long after its 1971 debut. Perhaps because it was essentially plastic wrap you, uh, put in the oven.Presto PizzaKellogg\u2019s mysteriously shelf-stable pizza-filled Pop-Tart, was, frankly, ahead of its time.The BaconerRedbook\u2019s bacon-only toaster promised to contain the scent of bacon. But why?!Crisp-i-TatersThese snacks promised \u201cpotato chip taste with a french fry shape\u201d but were the least of both worlds.Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
