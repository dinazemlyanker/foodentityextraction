Over the past 15 years, Mouzawak has built bed-and-breakfasts, restaurants, and Beirut\u2019s first farmers\u2019 market with one goal: to create places that unite and give voice to Lebanese people from different faiths and political backgrounds, especially women.Mouzawak restored Beit Douma with his partner of 20 years, fashion designer Rabih Kayrouz.\nPhoto by Alex LauThe inn\u2019s personal decor makes it feel as though you\u2019re in someone\u2019s (very stylish) home.\nPhoto by Alex LauAt the farmers\u2019 market, Souk el Tayeb, I met a woman named Mona al-Dorr selling her man\u2019oushe, a puffed flatbread speckled with za\u2019atar that she had made at home for years before finding an outlet at the souk. I saw Nada Saber, who was selling jars of hot-pink pickled turnips, known as mouneh, or Lebanese preserves. There were Muslim women alongside Christian women, working together to highlight the culinary traditions of Lebanon.The souk spawned Mouzawak\u2019s first restaurant, Tawlet, where each day one woman sets the menu with dishes from her respective region, like kibbeh basaliyehl from Kfardlekous in northern Lebanon, made with bulgur, caramelized onions, and pine nuts. Since Tawlet Beirut opened in 2009, Mouzawak launched four more restaurants, providing jobs and a platform for women all over the country. \u201cI want people to know that this lady\u2014and all the ladies of the Souk el Tayeb and Tawlet\u2014now have a role outside of being a wife or mother,\u201d says Zeinab Harb Kashmar, one of the cooks at Tawlet, through a translator.BA\u2019s Andy Baraghani with Mouzawak.\nPhoto by Alex LauOne of Mouzawak\u2019s latest projects is more dream house than do-good venture, but it serves an important goal just the same. It\u2019s Beit Douma, a five-room 19th-century bed-and-breakfast that Mouzawak restored in the town of Douma, one of Lebanon\u2019s best-preserved historic villages. Situated on a hillside 90 minutes from Beirut, Beit Douma prizes local items on its menu as well as in its decor. \u201cBeit Douma gives you a sense of place. The cover on your bed is from the village of Douma. The wine you\u2019re drinking is from the area. The dessert is made by [the manager] Sarah\u2019s mom,\u201d he says. \u201cIt should serve as an embassy of pride for the region.\u201dThe lunch rush at Tawlet Beirut.\nPhoto by Alex LauUpstairs at Beit Douma. The textiles, prints, pillows, and dishes are sourced from the region.\nPhoto by Alex LauWhen I visited, I cooked alongside Tawlet\u2019s executive chef, Andrea Bouez. Many of the dishes we made\u2014cinnamon-dusted lamb chops; a crunchy cabbage tabbouleh with piles of mint and parsley; marinated chicken skewers served atop flatbread\u2014originated from the women who work at the restaurant and Souk el Tayeb. (Get all the recipes here.) Each dish did more than feed us. It honored the unique backgrounds of the individual women who developed them, while celebrating the larger cultural heritage of the country as a whole.Below, four women cooks share their stories.Photo by Alex LauMona El Dor (Oum Ali)\u201cI\u2019ve known Kamal for 18 years, and was one of the first women to work with him at Souk el Tayeb when it opened in June 2004. It started out really small, with just 10 stands. At first I was working on my own in the stall, selling my mouneh\u2014jams, labne, olives, and other Lebanese preserves\u2014and later man\u2019oushe, flatbreads, which I had been making at home for years. Business started really slow; no one was coming at first. I was even throwing bread away. But then it started to pick up as word got around. Kamal got more women open stands, and seven months later, it moved to downtown Beirut. Now there are more than 80 stands at Souk el Tayeb on Saturdays. At my stall, I have four women to help me with the breads and pastries, and you have to wait in line for an hour and a half for my man\u2019oushe. All the demand meant I could open a shop in Beirut, Oum Ali\u2014my nickname, \u201cmother of Ali\u201d\u2014and collaborate with other restaurants in the city who want to use my breads.Since I started working with Kamal 15 years ago, I\u2019ve been able to live the life I\u2019d always dreamed about. I grew up in Majdelzoun, a village in the south of Lebanon, and I didn\u2019t want my four kids to live there, to receive a poor education. Joining Souk el Tayeb and Tawlet enabled me to bring my family to the city and to put my kids through school. I always wanted to be the person who studied everything, but I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019m very happy to be able to do this for my kids.\u201dPhoto by Alex LauNada Saber\u201cFor years my husband and I had a small food shack in the village of Kherbet Kanafar, in the Bekaa Valley, but we had to close down when the bombings started in 2005. He went to work with my brother doing interior design, and I kept making my mouneh at home. A friend told me that she knew someone who had a souk, and that she wanted to introduce me to him. Kamal checked out my samples and told me, \u2018You\u2019ll start next week.\u2019 Over time, I increased our quantities to meet the demand\u2014my husband even left his job to work with me at the stand. Even with the bombings, we didn\u2019t stop the souk for a second. Everything else was shut down, but we opened every week, no matter what. The souk grew up, and I grew up with it.\u201dPhoto by Alex LauGeorgina El-Bayeh\u201cI used to spend all my time at home, just visiting with all the other ladies of my village of Kfardlekos. My husband worked, and I raised the kids. Since joining with Tawlet in 2009 and then Souk el Tayeb after that, it\u2019s all shifted. Now I\u2019m the one who works. I\u2019m the one that supports the household. I was even able to open my own storefront in my village, Georgina\u2019s Kitchen, where I prepare and sell the things I make. (My specialty is kebbeh and stuffed vine leaves.) Working here has turned me into a super star; I have my own fan base at the restaurant! One of the biggest highlights for me was going to Copenhagen for the MAD food symposium, and cooking with Ren\u00e9 Redzepi. There we were, 20 home cooks, with hundreds of Michelin-star chefs from around the world. We were very proud to be among them, showing off Lebanese food.\u201dPhoto by Alex LauZeinab Harb Kashmar\u201cBefore I met Kamal, I worked with other women making mouneh in the village of Halloussieh, in the city of Sour. Our cooperative was known for our olives, and when Kamal heard of them, he offered us a stall at Souk el Tayeb. In the beginning, Kamal would come by and taste our olives; then he started to buy them to use at Tawlet. One day, about five months into my time running the stall, he asked me to come cook at the restaurant. I was scared. I didn\u2019t know how to cook professionally. He told me, \u2018The way you cook for your kids, you\u2019re going to cook here.\u2019I\u2019m fully Lebanese, but since working with Kamal, I\u2019ve learned so much about Lebanon and the different ways of cooking\u2014including many of the forgotten dishes from my own village. My menus at Tawlet are all about trying to reintroduce them, to preserve the traditions and keep them alive. Before this, I had nothing to do. Now I have a presence, a role in the city. This lady\u2014and all the ladies of the Souk el Tayeb and Tawlet\u2014is not just a wife sitting at home.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titLebanonRead Morerecipes7 Recipes For a Truly Flavorful Lebanese FeastGallery7 SlidesBy Andy BaraghaniRecipes you want to make.
