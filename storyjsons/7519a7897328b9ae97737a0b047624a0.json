Case in point, this low-lift one-pan dish. The leftover fat is used to blister olives that then get mixed with cooked rice (or any other cooked grain you\u2019ve got) and chopped greens like spinach, kale, or chard. Za\u2019atar provides another layer of flavor. Be sure to check the ingredient list on your blend and season accordingly\u2014if it includes salt, you might not need to add any extra.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I thought he really lacked the onion.  The result was delicious!Carol BMenlo Park, CA3/24/2022This was great! I used a wok and it worked really well. Great for a weeknight dinner with leftovers for lunch.AJNashville, TN3/22/2022I really enjoyed this as a lunch for a few days. I used tofu instead of chicken (torn up firm tofu with cornstarch, olive oil, and paprika baked in a 400 oven for about 35min). Added red pepper flakes also. For olive-averse people, castleveltranos are quite different from the typical Spanish green olives, really urge you to try them if you haven\u2019t before!JuliePhiladelphia, PA3/21/2022How is this without olives?  Outside of a martini, I really don't care for them, but the rest of the dish sounds good!Drew HOith3/21/2022Excellent Dish - Flavorful, Easy-to-Make\n\nThis dish came together very well!  I loved the strategy of arranging the turkey \"in pan in a thin, even layer and cook, undisturbed.\" That seemed to keep enough liquid / moisture to bring everything together. You might like a wok-sized pan to finally bring everything together, but a terrific dish that will be a go-to in our home. Drew C.Fairfield, CT3/21/2022The flavors in this dish are amazing, but I had a hard time getting the rice crispy due to the sheer volume of ingredients in the pan (who has a non stick that big?). Next time I will do the rice by itself in a separate pan (or maybe do the whole thing in the wok?) and combine at the end. The dill on top is a great touch, really brings the freshness out, and as someone who can make 30-40 olives be dinner, it's great to use them IN something. This is going in the rotation for sure.chelsearichmond, va3/18/2022Very dry. There\u2019s no liquid in this recipe!  Maybe some chicken broth would help.
