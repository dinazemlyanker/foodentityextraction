Ours were super crispy in about 28 minutes--a bit overcooked, too. I'd either lower the amount of time to about 25 minute or increase the thickness of the potato to 3/8\" or maybe 1/2\". We cut the recipe in half, which was more than enough for two people...also used non-fat yogurt, which seemed to work fine--the dip was tasty.\nLebo151Pittsburgh, PA12/5/2021Great spices. But 45 minutes in an air fryer gives you burnt potatoes. You guys need to recheck that time on your air fryer. Maybe 45 in an ovenAnonymousDallas, Texas10/13/202145 minutes is not an attractive thought.guess I\u2019ll stick with my original method but thanks for clarifying to rid me of my misconceptions.AnonymousMontana10/9/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titRusset PotatoPotatoVegetableYogurtOther IngredientsTahiniCondiments, Sauces & PastesVeganVegetarianDairy-FreeDinnerSideEasyRecipes you want to make.
