It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.How the first #bacookbookclub went downNormally I live by the Groucho Marx maxim \u201cI don\u2019t care to belong to any club that will have me as a member,\u201d but made an exception for the newly launched Bon App\u00e9tit cookbook club. You get food at the end? Okay, I\u2019m in. 16 staffers and not a single man (you know who are\u2014and you better join in next month or ELSE) cooked recipes from Nik Sharma\u2019s beautiful new book, Season, and gathered around the table to talk about how it went. I made a pineapple-serrano infused gin cocktail that had me squeezing pineapple pulp in cheesecloth over my sink at 8 a.m. like an amateur milkmaid, which was a first but not a last. The finished cocktail had a subtle heat and clean pineapple flavor\u2014refreshing! Molly Baz made chaat masala-rubbed pork chops (pictured above) that wowed us all, Carla Lalli Music made lamb-stuffed mashed potato pancakes I wanted to sit in close proximity to, and Carey Polis\u2019s sweet potato bebinca, a smooth pudding cake of my favorite texture (jiggly), was all I wanted for breakfast today. The challenge to tackle a recipe you might not have otherwise, coordinate and gather with friends around a table, talk about your successes and pitfalls in the journey of cooking\u2014it\u2019s not just for Thanksgiving! Find a cookbook you\u2019re excited about and give it a go. A Google doc and a little planning is all it takes.Want this letter before it hits the website?

That was delicious.\u201d But you can tell they\u2019re just saying what they\u2019re supposed to say as dinner guests at your table. And I can live on that alone! But sometimes they tell the truth and in those moments you bask in the glory. I made this winter squash carbonara recently and everyone at the table went back for seconds, using tongs to grab extra slivers of chopped bacon. My great aunt, whose kitchen I was crashing, went back for thirds. And she does thing where she puts a New York menu price on the dish, which I love. \u201cYou could charge $16 for this!\u201d She told me over the blasting audio of whoever was pontificating on MSNBC. \u201cAt Via Carota!\u201d She added. My heart was full. The roasted squash melts into the noodles + egg yolks + pasta water and becomes creamy, coating each strand. The bacon is bacon. We added a little Lacinato kale for health. Make this pasta.Alex LauGarlic powder 4 lyfeThis chicken cutlet is a great recipe, but a lot of people decide not to make it because they can\u2019t find Maggi seasoning (a super concentrated \u201cflavor enhancer\u201d like extreme soy sauce). It goes in the buttermilk ranch dressing that\u2019s doctored up with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, onion powder, and garlic powder, the ingredient we waxed poetic about this week. Why use garlic powder instead of fresh? You can find out here, and then buy yourself a new jar, because yours looks dusty.The sprouting sweet potatoSpeaking of natural wonders of the world, we\u2019ve have a purple Japanese sweet potato on our snack table for a few...months now. When it finally sprouted, Basically editor Amiel Stanek started referring to it as his \u201cson.\u201d Suddenly we were all emotionally attached to this grotesque and lumpy potato boy. As it sat in the sun, more sprouts grew into what looked like a curly head of hair atop the potato head. This week, Brad Leone walked over and gasped in delight: \u201cLook at that! You can plant it in some dirt and it\u2019ll sprout more sweet potatoes.\u201d Alex Delany popped up from his desk, \u201cNo it won\u2019t,\u201d which really riled Brad up. \u201cPUT IT IN THE DIRT, YA DINGLE!\u201d He said. \u201cI do it every year\u2014decoratively.\u201d So when the time is right, we might just do that. If Amiel can say goodbye.Photo by Heather StenTwo great readsCecilia Chiang is a 99-year-old restaurant icon. I can\u2019t believe Priya Krishna was invited to her birthday dinner and got to snag a selfie with the (selfie-loving) lady of the hour. (Read for her aside about James Beard.)I\u2019m intrigued by udon master (and BA Hot 10 chef) Tsuyoshi Nishioka\u2019s obsession with dreams. Am I workshopping my life goals enough? Clearly not. Am I eating enough udon? Also no. I gotta work on that.Unnecessary food feud of the weekApple announced a few new food emojis this week, the most controversial being this shiny, dry-looking abominably plain bagel. \u201cDewy,\u201d wrote Healthyish editor Amanda Shapiro, shuddering as she typed. \u201cIt\u2019s like a Ken doll version of a bagel,\u201d said restaurant editor Elyse Inamine. \u201cThe inside is like unexpectedly looking into a high def zoom mirror that shows you all of your pores,\u201d said editorial assistant Jesse Sparks, who\u2019d rather not catch that glimpse. \u201cUncomfortable,\u201d noted social media manager Emily Schultz. \u201crly firm\u201d typed editorial assistant Emma Wartzman. Molly Baz uploaded an image of a Thomas brand bagel for some reason. Like the drooly face, clown face, and blue bowl with NOTHING IN IT, the new bagel will be relegated to the emojis of little purpose file. At least it wasn\u2019t...blueberry?Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
