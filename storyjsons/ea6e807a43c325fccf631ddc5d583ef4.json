When something\u2019s so easy to make that you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.When Georgians feast, they go all out. Slabs of meat sizzle over grapevine embers, cheese breads ooze by the dozen, and soup dumplings arrive by the hot, slurpy vatful.\u00a0But when I\u2019m lucky enough to be at a Georgian supra (traditional feast), it\u2019s never the mtsvadi, khachapuri, or khinkali that I lurch for first but rather the sleeper-hit vegetable spreads hiding at the end of the table: Pass the pkhali, please.\u00a0What is pkhali?Pkhali (\u10e4\u10ee\u10d0\u10da\u10d8) is what Georgians call any cooked vegetable pounded with walnuts, garlic, and spices. Some people translate pkhali as \u201cvegetable p\u00e2t\u00e9,\u201d but I think of it as a spreadable salad. It\u2019s pungent and colorful\u2014fuchsia when made with beets, bright green when starring spinach. Eggplant, carrots, squash, beans, and sorrel are also common protagonists, but you can use whatever produce you have on hand, even if it\u2019s past its prime\u2014no one will be the wiser since it\u2019s getting banged up anyway. You can dress pkhali up\u2014in the Before Times I\u2019d nudge it into dainty marquises, bopping each with pomegranate seeds for an eye-popping starter or vegan charcuterie board item\u2014or just spoon it onto warm bread and eat it hunched over the sink.Everything I know about pkhali I owe to chef Meriko Gubeladze. You could call her Georgia\u2019s pkhali queen: At her candlelit restaurant, Shavi Lomi, in Tbilisi, the nation\u2019s capital, diners huddle around big wooden bowls brimming with pkhali. They take turns scooping the vibrant spreads onto griddled corn cakes called mchadi, pkhali\u2019s traditional sidekick, between bites of squeaky guda cheese and pickled bladderwort buds (jonjoli). I\u2019ve spent months in Georgia eating my way from the Black Sea coast to the Azerbaijani border, and few dishes have blown my mind like Shavi Lomi\u2019s pkhali plate.That\u2019s because Gubeladze\u2019s family has been making the dish for generations. \u201cPkhali reminds me of my grandma,\u201d she said. Growing up, her grandmother would sit in the sun kneading mountains of herbs and boiled greens for pkhali until they were fragrant and tender. \u201cIt was always poor-people food, what you ate during Lent or when you couldn\u2019t afford meat,\u201d Gubeladze said. \u201cPeople would collect whatever edible weeds they could find and make a meal out of them by adding a paste of walnuts or hazelnuts.\u201d Beets and carrots, other popular pkhali ingredients, likely found their way into the dish in the Soviet era as they were plentiful and cheap due to industrialized farming.And how do you make it?To make pkhali, Gubeladze starts with 2 cups cooked vegetables, cooled and squeezed of excess moisture. These should be grated, chopped coarse, or mushed up with your hands, depending on the type of vegetable and how you like it cooked. Most Georgians boil their pkhali veggies till just soft (5 minutes for spinach, longer for hardy greens like beet tops and chard), but Gubeladze favors the oven for beets (400\u00ba for 50\u201360 minutes, wrapped in foil), leeks (325\u00ba for 20 minutes), eggplant (20\u201330 minutes under the broiler, then scooped from the skin), and carrots and squash (400\u00ba for 25 minutes for either).This is a good opportunity to use your blanched and squeezed greens.\nPhoto by Laura Murray, food styling by Susie TheodorouTo make the dressing, grind \u00bd cup (50 grams) walnuts (be sure they\u2019re fresh and of good quality) to the consistency of coarse sand using a meat grinder (what Georgians use), mortar and pestle, or food processor, and transfer the nuts to a medium bowl. Stir in 1 tsp. salt, 1\u00bd Tbsp. red wine vinegar or pomegranate juice, 2 tsp. ground coriander, 1 minced garlic clove, crushed red pepper flakes (to taste), \u00bc cup chopped cilantro, and 2 Tbsp. finely chopped scallion or white onion. Incorporate 1\u20132 Tbsp. water to form a thick, sludgy sauce (the \u201cWAP\u201d lyric \u201cmake it cream, make me scream\u201d springs to mind).Add the vegetables to the dressing and mix everything well with your hands, adding water as needed to form a thick, moldable paste. Taste for seasoning: The pkhali should be zippy with plenty of vinegar, salt, and garlic. Roll the mixture into single-serving balls or patties, or mound it onto a large serving plate. Feeling lavish? Trace a crosshatch pattern across the top with a fork and sprinkle all over with pomegranate seeds and walnut oil. Pkhali should be served at a cool room temperature and tastes best the day it\u2019s made.In the rare case I am stuck with leftovers, I\u2019m blasphemously un-Georgian with them. I like to spoon pkhali over polenta, swirl it onto sandwiches, and toss it with cold pasta for bracingly fresh salads.\u00a0Until I\u2019m back in Georgia, back at that bountiful supra table, these small thrills will have to suffice.Benjamin Kemper is a freelance food and travel writer based in Madrid, Spain.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimpleRecipes you want to make.
