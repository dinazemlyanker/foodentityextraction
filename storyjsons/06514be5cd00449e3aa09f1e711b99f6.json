When something\u2019s so easy to make that you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.My mom used to bulk-buy boxes of oyster sauce\u2014every recipe she made for stir-fried vegetables called for it, and she wouldn\u2019t let us kids go one meal without eating our greens.But there are so many great reasons to keep a bottle of oyster sauce in the fridge. As a no-frills (read: lazy) home cook whose go-to recipes are all under 20 minutes, I tend to throw a few tablespoons of oyster sauce into whatever\u2019s cooking in my pan\u2014vegetables, minced pork, tofu, instant noodles, fried rice\u2026everything! Oyster sauce has this caramel-like sweetness and mildly briny saltiness that works well with just about any food. And not having to make a sauce from scratch by carefully measuring out six different types of dressings helps me keep my cooking time to a minimum.The good stuff!!!\nPhoto by Laura MurrayConsidering my prolific use, you\u2019d think I wouldn\u2019t have been that surprised to see this recipe for Spicy Garlic Butter Linguini from Marion\u2019s Kitchen calls for oyster sauce. But I was. The combination of butter, garlic, and red pepper flakes in this dish distinguishes it from any bowl of g\u00e0n l\u0101o mi\u00e0n (dry-tossed noodles), and that doesn\u2019t even begin to address the Parmesan in the ingredient list. Cheese with oyster sauce? Really?But after whipping it up for dinner one day, I was absolutely hooked. It\u2019s loaded with garlic and bursting with umami, reminding me of classic stir-fried veggies topped generously with fried garlic. The thick, almost syrupy consistency of the oyster sauce clings to the noodles, giving them a glossy coating. It\u2019s the sort of super savory pasta that keeps you slurping until there\u2019s only a light sheen of oil left on the plate.While the original recipe includes a few more ingredients, such as soy sauce and Parmesan, I\u2019ve tried making it with just five, and it still comes out as lip-smacking. I\u2019d compare it to an aglio, olio e peperoncino (garlic and chile with butter as a substitute for olive oil) with a twist. The oyster sauce lends the dish a rich savoriness without the pungency that can come with seafood.Just like my mom, I don\u2019t measure out my ingredients, but here\u2019s my best approximation for my variation of this dish that feeds two: Finely chop 8\u201310 garlic cloves (I said it was garlicky!), then saut\u00e9 them in 2 \u00bd Tbsp. butter along with 1 \u00bd Tbsp. crushed red pepper flakes (I like my food with extra heat, but you could certainly use less). Once the garlic is lightly browned, add 2 \u00bd Tbsp. oyster sauce and stir until the butter and oyster sauce are well mixed. Then throw in 8 oz. al dente spaghetti (or any other long-shaped pasta) and toss \u2019em around until evenly coated. When it\u2019s ready to serve, garnish with a handful of chopped scallions.Whether you\u2019re tossing your oyster sauce with Chinese broccoli or adding it to your pasta or noodle dishes, you\u2019ll want to adopt my mom\u2019s practice of buying oyster sauce in bulk. That way, you\u2019ll never run out.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimpleOyster SauceChineseSpaghettiRead MorecookingI Wouldn\u2019t Have Dreamt of Making My Own Korma\u2014Until I Figured Out This ShortcutBy Varu ChilakamarriRecipes you want to make.
