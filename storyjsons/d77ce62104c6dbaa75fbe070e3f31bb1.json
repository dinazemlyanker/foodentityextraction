Food Styling by Pearl Jones.\u00a0EmailPinterestPrintEmailPinterestPrintThe real star of this vegan dinner is the smoky chipotle oil created by frying chipotles in adobo: It gets used to roast sweet potatoes; to fry tempeh crumbles, which become bacon-y in the process; and even used to dress the apple-cilantro salad.

I didn't have really much oil come off the tempeh mixture and my tempeh was sort of crisped. Not sure I would go through this effort again.CookRye, NY3/21/2022I made this recipe to have something to eat at the office for lunch this week, and it did not disappoint. Great mixture of textures and flavors! As earlier comments note, 8 oz of tempeh is really only about 2.5 servings, so I used three sweet potatoes instead of four, which gave me enough topping for the three servings. As I'm not a fan of beauregard or jewel sweet potatoes (too watery for my preference) I used a mix of Hannah and Japanese sweet potatoes, which continue to have a nice texture even after sitting in the fridge for a day or two after cooking. I added a drizzle of tahini, which finished it off perfectly. Looking forward to making this again! KayleePhiladelphia PA2/9/2022Great recipe - prepared it twice already, exactly as written. What a delicious and satisfying dinner for two trying to do good. Fit FoodiesPark Falls WI1/25/2022Wow!  This was a FABULOUS recipe. I was looking for something unique to do with tempeh and this did not disappoint. My husband, a big foodie said he LOVED it. Next time I might add a 3rd pepper. Also, the tempeh did not crisp up as promised. Next time I\u2019ll. Lay it flat on paper towels, perhaps that will help. Also, I wondered how much shallots should be used. Shallots come in all sizes. Our shallots amounted to a little more than 1/4 cup. \n\nAll in all though - it was so delicious!  Don\u2019t skimp on the apple salad. It pulls it all together. \ud83d\ude0aBS0901Phoenix 1/20/2022I love these fresh, addictive, and pantry friendly flavours. The spice level is lovely. My only issue is that the tempeh did not crisp (that could have been my poor technique), and that the topping to potato recipe seems off. 8oz of Tempeh is at most 2.5 servings. I woul consider doubling the toppings or reducing the potato for a better serving size.Anonymous801101/20/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titVeganVegetarianSweet PotatoRoastWeeknightEasyQuickChipotleChileVegetableRecipes you want to make.
