Next up is Taylor Elyse Morrison, founder of self-care start-up Inner Workout. \u00a0Taylor Elyse Morrison knows what it\u2019s like when wellness starts feeling like another item on the to-do list. Her philosophy? Make your practice cumulative, not stressful. Since starting her company, Inner Workout, an online platform offering self-care resources and experiences, she\u2019s been more intentional about turning inward, and responding to her needs as they arise rather than sticking to an arbitrary schedule.\u00a0A day in the founder\u2019s life looks a whole lot different from the hustle-heavy stereotype of entrepreneurship. There\u2019s plenty of that, of course, but if Morrison craves a midday bath or a moment to doodle in her notebook, she\u2019ll do it. As someone still figuring out my own self-care style, her in-the-moment approach intrigued me. I\u2019ve certainly felt discouraged when it feels like everyone else on Instagram has their \u201ctwo hours of self-care before 8 a.m.\u201d routine lock-in. Some days I can comfortably squeeze in 10 minutes of meditation, 30 minutes of reading and journaling, and 45 minutes of exercise before work. On other days, I feel lucky if I can manage a cup of hot water and lemon.Instead is available for preorder on Kickstarter through March 11.\nPhotograph by Anna ZajacTo Morrison, having an hours-long routine isn\u2019t always realistic, or even what you need every day. But it is possible to reclaim brief moments of care. That\u2019s where Inner Workout\u2019s latest product\u2014a 50-card deck called Instead\u2014comes in. The idea is that if you\u2019re bored and tempted to grab your phone, you pick up a card instead. Each one offers a bite-size activity or affirmation prompt designed to help us quit the dreaded doomscroll, reclaim our minutes, and encourage daily reflection. Suggestions like \u201cfeel your feet on the floor\u201d or \u201cfind rest in this moment\u201d promote contemplation over comparison and offer manageable strategies for feeling better. Over time, the idea is that each little moment adds up, as you divest from distraction and reinvest in self-care.Instead is available for preorder on Kickstarter through March 11. Ahead of the product\u2019s official launch, I spoke with Morrison to find out how she integrates these principles into her own life, what led to the creation of Instead, and why quality over quantity matters with self-care.Today for my self-care\u2026 I woke up without an alarm, laid in bed listening to the sounds, and then checked the time on my phone. I meditated for about seven minutes with the Insight Timer app. Then I took my dog for a walk. Later I did a Barre workout, which I was really nervous to do because that amount of muscle repetition hurts! But I decided that I needed it for my body. In the middle of the day, I took a bath because I was freezing and that\u2019s how I like to warm up.I\u2019m not interested in being\u2026 the type of entrepreneur who is \u201con\u201d all the time. I\u2019m trying to push back against that mentality, and I\u2019ve gotten really intentional about it over the past six months. I remind myself that I don\u2019t always need to be on email or social media. Generally, I try to check my email four times a day. I allow myself two Instagram visits per day, but I don\u2019t have a strict time limit. I\u2019m experimenting with what feels good, but the goal is to be on for only what\u2019s necessary. My natural state is to work all the time, especially when I enjoy that work. But if I\u2019m going to sit here and say that it\u2019s important for you to take care of yourself and I\u2019m burning myself out, that\u2019s not in alignment with my personal values or my company\u2019s values.Being distracted and taking breaks\u2026 isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. But I found that scrolling was not a helpful way for me to take a break. Instead of sitting and thinking about things when I was bored or anxious, I\u2019d scroll. And I\u2019d get all this information that wasn\u2019t actually helping me process my feelings, so I\u2019d just sort of stew in them. I think that kind of passive, mindless dwelling can exacerbate your stress and feelings of negative self-worth. That time could be spent on supporting your well-being instead of pouring hours into an addictive app that\u2019s designed to hold your attention for as long as possible.What we heard in our customer research was\u2026 people didn\u2019t love how much they were engaging with Instagram. Then, when the pandemic hit, it was clear that we all started spending even more time on the platform. People essentially said that Instagram is a \u201cnecessary evil,\u201d especially for creatives and business owners who feel like they need to have some type of presence on there. But they also feel worse about their art or business when they compare themselves to other people\u2019s highlight reel. My team and I came up with four different product options, and the deck of cards resonated the most.One of our impact goals is to\u2026 help people reinvest 500 hours a year from social media into self-care. To some extent, it\u2019s helpful to have social media to connect and reach people, especially right now when we\u2019re so isolated. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s where the transformation happens. We can post all kinds of feel-good quotes, but it takes more than a double tap or a share for those things to have an impact. We have to actually practice them. Knowing, caring for, and becoming your full self requires intentional work. The Instead cards offer a direct route to doing that. For example, the other day I was in a Zoom meeting and I pulled a card that said \u201cmake art.\u201d So I started doodling while I was listening in on the meeting, instead of scrolling on Instagram or getting distracted by my website\u2019s Google analytics.When it comes to self-care\u2026 I think we get stuck on the quantity debate\u2014how much is enough? It\u2019s of course nice to care for yourself for longer periods of time, but that isn\u2019t always realistic or accessible to everyone. I think bite-size moments of self-care add up in the same way that bite-size social media moments add up\u2014or those moments when you\u2019re feeling inadequate or stressed or overwhelmed. You can replace those moments with listening to yourself and doing something kind for yourself. It starts to add up and you start craving more of that.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishPerson of InterestSelf CareInterviewsRead MorecultureThis Twitter Tarot Reader Finds Mental Health Wisdom in the CardsBy Joseph HernandezLifestyleAstrology Apps and Tarot Cards: My Pandemic Search for CertaintyBy MacKenzie Chung FeganRecipes you want to make.
