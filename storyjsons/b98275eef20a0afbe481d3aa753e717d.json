Toasted rice powder gives larb its distinct pebbled texture and nutty flavor. Making it is easy: Slowly toast uncooked glutinous (sticky) rice in a pan until it\u2019s golden and deliciously fragrant, then grind in a spice mill until it\u2019s the consistency of coarsely cracked black pepper. Make extra rice powder and keep the leftovers in a jar to add texture to noodles and salads\u2026or another batch of larb.Ingredients4 Servings\u2153cup (or more) fresh lime juice\u00bccup light soy sauce1Tbsp. palm or light brown sugar2tsp.

I tweaked recipe slightly by crumbling the tofu and frying in two tablespoons of oil for about eight minutes (until browned). That really helped recreate the \u2018mince\u2019 found normally in larb. Katharine Australia9/26/2021I LOVE this recipe. Same with the smoked tofu though... I just use marinated tofu from Whole Foods. \nOne question I have is about the rice. Sometimes the rice is very grainy in the dish. Am I not grinding it long enough or not toasting rice long enough? AspenZAspen2/12/2021Super delicious, quick, easy. Used 16 oz regular firm tofu, short-grain Thai rice because I didn\u2019t have glutinous, and a dash of cayenne instead of chili powder. Came out great. Used mortar and pestle for grinding rice. Used Thai basil (2 small Whole Foods packages), mint (half a small Whole Foods package), and cilantro (one small Whole Foods package).AnonymousIndianapolis, IN11/11/2020This  was wonderful. So delcious and  so easy to make.  I could  only find smoked tofu in 11oz packages. I made the same amount of dressing, just less tofu. 11 oz of tofu was plenty. I also didn't have the full amount of basil and mint as the recipe, but what I had worked just fine.  We ate it all and thoroughly enjoyed it. Will make this for friends.AnonymousCedar Grove NC11/10/2020Wow! So flavorful and relatively easy aside from grinding the rice powder. We didn\u2019t have smoked tofu and added a tiny bit of liquid smoke instead, which I think was key to the other flavors. Herb wise we used basil and mint and it was great. Will definitely make again.FierybellySeattle, WA11/8/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladLaotianSoutheast AsianAsianThaiTofuOther IngredientsLemongrassHerbs & SpicesWeeknight MealsQuickEasySideMainVeganVegetarianDairy-FreeHealthyishLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
