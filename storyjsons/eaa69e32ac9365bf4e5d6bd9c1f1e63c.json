Just don't call it a mocktail.By Christina ChaeyJune 3, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsea KyleFacebookTwitterEmailHealthyish Loves It is our weekly newsletter where we tell you about the stuff we can't live without. See our past recommendations here!Although I'm hardly what anyone would call \u201csober-curious,\u201d I have little desire to imbibe after a long weekend of drinking. So when I get home from work during the week, I like to fix myself a tonic with Element Pineapple-Turmeric Shrub, which gives me all the satisfaction of a cocktail, minus the booze.Shrub is vinegar that\u2019s been infused with ripe fruit and sugar, resulting in a tart-sweet syrup that adds tangy complexity to a cocktail, or in the case of my weeknight routine, good plain seltzer. This heady, golden-hued one by Element is like eating spears of sunny-sweet pineapple on a balmy beach. The addition of turmeric lends a subtle grounding flavor that, along with the acidic vinegar, makes for a perfectly balanced drink. It\u2019s potent stuff\u2014all you need is a tablespoon or two mixed into a glass of seltzer on ice for a gulpable fruit drink.I\u2019ve recently turned my roommate onto the stuff, too. Recently, we\u2019ve gotten into the habit of making it nice for ourselves by breaking out proper rocks glasses and the fancy two-inch square ice cubes we keep in the freezer. One thing we definitely don\u2019t do? Call it a \u201cmocktail.\u201d\u2014 Christina Chaey, associate editorBuy it: Element Pineapple Turmeric Shrub, $15 for 8 oz.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
