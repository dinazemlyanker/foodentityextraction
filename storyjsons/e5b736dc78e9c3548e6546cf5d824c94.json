Don\u2019t @ me.By Emily SchultzOctober 7, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by \u0141ukasz Gol\u0119dzinowskiFacebookTwitterEmailWhen my grandma calls to check in, it\u2019s usually a Tuesday around 12:45 p.m., the time people in T.V. shows gather in a \u201cstaff lounge\u201d to eat their Tupperware-packed lunches. She picks up on the fact that I\u2019m at my desk, because I\u2019m usually speaking softly, which is precisely when the concerned voice comes in: \u201cDon\u2019t you have a lunch break?!\u201dYes Nanny, I do have a lunch break. But I spend it at my desk, not because I\u2019m a crazed New York Media person who spends all of her time checking emails and reading between the lines of the latest subtweet. But because I actually enjoy eating my lunch in front of my computer.I know, I know, everyone says that we spend too much time in front of screens, that we should be getting up from our chairs more, that we should be going outside, and what\u2019s that thing about stopping to smell the roses? Well I keep my computer brightness down to a level that makes my eyes happy, and so what if I like the nothingness smell of a cookie-cutter corporate office? I\u2019m still taking a break, just maybe not in the way the latest women\u2019s health magazine tells me to.Here\u2019s the thing: If you catch me chomping on my desk salad or leftover pasta or hard boiled eggs, I\u2019m not actually working. I\u2019m catching up on the latest from The Cut, or scrolling through meme Twitter, or reading the longform article my coworker Alex Beggs dropped into slack that morning. (She always has good intel on the things you should and shouldn\u2019t be reading on the internet.) Looking busy enough that no one bothers me definitely feels like a win\u2014and it\u2019s way better than staring into some abyss for 30 minutes while poking and prodding some bibb lettuce.So the next time you see something about how peak self care, health, wellness, and happiness is taking 30 minutes during your day to be away from your computer, call bullshit, pull out your lunch, and read about Father Divine or WTF glitter is instead.Explore Bon App\u00e9titLunchRecipes you want to make.
