But the first sausage he learned to make was sai ua from his dad. It has a vibrant flavor from the slew of herbs and spices that get mixed in. It\u2019s what started his journey into exploring Thai food and his own roots.Ingredients4 ServingsChile Dip2medium shallots, unpeeled1head of garlic, unpeeled4Anaheim chiles1red or green Thai chile2Tbsp.

Broil shallots, garlic, and Anaheim and Thai chiles on a rimmed baking sheet, turning halfway through, until charred in most spots, 4\u20138 minutes. (Alternatively, you can char individually over a burner if you\u2019ve got a gas stovetop.) Let cool.Step 2Peel shallots, garlic, and chile (it\u2019s okay if some charred bits stay attached; they will add smoky flavor), then coarsely chop. Transfer to a mortar and pestle or a food processor and mash or pulse to a coarse paste. Mix in lime juice, cilantro, fish sauce, and sugar; season with salt. Taste and add more lime juice, fish sauce, and/or sugar if needed.Step 3Do ahead: Dip can be made 1 day ahead.

I ruined my batch by following these directions while using a curry paste with salt. They were inedible. Could tell they would have been delicious otherwise. AnonymousConnecticut 10/27/2020This was really good! Followed almost exactly except I used serrano instead of a Thai chili and butter lettuce in place of cabbage. Just make sure you watch your salt in the chicken mixture. Mine turned out a little too salty because I used a salted curry paste (Mae Ploy), so my fault.AnonymousDenton, TX10/22/2020I\u2019ve never made Thai food, but I made this tonight, substituting ground turkey because it was all I could find. I also used jalape\u00f1os and tomatillos instead of Thai chile and Anaheim chiles, both because I couldn\u2019t find the others, and because it scares me that the Thai are 15x hotter than jalape\u00f1os. The dish was amazing and I will definitely make it again. My arm felt like it would fall off after I mixed for three minutes with a wooden spoon, and I\u2019m a pretty buff dude. I feel like a stand mixer with a dough hook would have worked better (if I had one). After that, the meat forms a sort of emulsion and looked similar to bratwurst after cooking. A cast iron skillet with peanut oil (high smoke point) and a fish spatula worked well. I found the lime leaf at Mollie Stone\u2019s, and it\u2019s such a unique and delicious ingredient. It tastes very reminiscent of tom kha and other Thai dishes I\u2019ve tried, but I never would have been able to place it before. Thanks Parnass! AnonymousSan Francisco10/20/2020I made this last night with a few substitutions: ground turkey for chicken, 1.5 tsp of lime zest for the lime leaves, and only 1 tbsp. of the fish sauce. My husband and I ate these as romaine lettuce wraps with the sticky rice, chile dip (SO GOOD) avocado and some fresh herbs and it was absolutely delicious. Looking forward to trying it again with the regular ingredients!caitmarybarryQuincy, MA9/30/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titThaiSoutheast AsianAsianGround ChickenChickenPoultryAnaheim ChileChileVegetableMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeKetoSaut\u00e9DinnerRecipes you want to make.
