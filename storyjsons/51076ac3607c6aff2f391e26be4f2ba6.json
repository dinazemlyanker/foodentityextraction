As Markham reminds you with a wink, this cocktail is not meant to be savored: \u201cThe faster you drink, the faster you feel better.\u201dMarkham, who has amassed more than 87,000 TikTok followers since December, belongs to a new wave of social media kitchen witches: spiritually-minded cooks who combine mysticism and wellness with recipe content. Though magical cooking has been around since prerecorded history, the pandemic has inspired a renaissance of these age-old traditions, reaching eager home cooks.The culinary rituals of kitchen witchery are wide-ranging, from multi-ingredient recipe spells to practical applications addressing specific pandemic woes. Got an excess of shallots you panic-ordered online? Domestic pagan @Madge_LaRue believes these pocket-size alliums hold powerful healing qualities and suggests to her 124,000 followers to fry and store them for later use in salads, sandwiches, and casseroles.Or maybe you\u2019re looking to boost your creativity after months of Zoom fatigue. Keon Dillon (@millennialsoulfood) recommends brewing dandelion tea to clear away emotional blockage. Dillon has been a kitchen witch for 15 years; through their Instagram Reels, they dive into the history and practices of Hoodoo\u2014known alternatively as conjure or rootwork\u2014a centuries-old African American spiritual tradition created by enslaved people.\u201cFood is important for Hoodoo and spell work,\u201d Dillon says. \u201cAlmost all ingredients have metaphysical and culinary properties.\u201d They recommend using thyme, rosemary, bay leaf, and other botanicals for prosperity, cleansing, and clarity.There\u2019s no single methodology when it comes to spiritual cooking today. Practitioners like LaRue, Markham, and Dillon pull from many different resources to explore their own brand of mystical food practice. Some pair the globally and historically diverse tenets of herbalism with incantations or other rituals to enhance the metaphysical experience. Home chefs dabbling in food spirituality are encouraged to dive into their own ancestral history for inspiration. Hoodoo, the spiritual philosophies behind Chinese folk medicine, and paganism (which originates from European customs) each come from distinct cultural traditions. Researching on your own is essential to better understand the complex racial and cultural origins of these practices\u2014and to avoid appropriating or partaking in a closed spiritual tradition.Though food-based spirituality may be manifold, almost any spiritual cook will tell you that the power of the practice lies in being mindful of what you consume. Whether or not you believe a garden herb can bring prosperity into your life, there\u2019s no denying the positive effects of intentionality. Mental health experts also cite mindfulness as a means to manage stress and lead a healthier lifestyle.\u201cSpell casting with food and simply being mindful about your intentions, those are the same things,\u201d says Adrian Chang of food journal My Kitsune Caf\u00e9. \u201cOne just happens to be more aesthetically mystical than the other.\u201d Chang has been experimenting with spirituality in his cooking for several years now, but he isn\u2019t surprised to see the uptick in interest throughout the pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence that everyone in the world right now is going through this kind of soul-searching, whether that\u2019s by baking sourdough or just going back to the basics and rediscovering our purpose,\u201d Chang says. \u201cPeople want to be more present in their lives.\u201dDuring periods of political instability and institutional mistrust, spiritual practices have long been a source of comfort and motivation. Medieval forms of magical \u201ccures\u201d offered a false hope during the Black Plague; some turned to witchcraft as a form of political resistance post-2016 election. Of course, no credible practitioners are hawking coronavirus-curing food spells or herbal remedies for geopolitical crises. But never in recent history have global events so sharply altered so many people's relationship to food. After months of grocery shortages and restaurant closings, spiritual cooking has offered people an empowering framework through which to approach uncertainty, both within and beyond the kitchen. Ongoing racial reckonings have also catalyzed a boom in food spirituality. \u201cSpeaking as a person of color, our foods are who we are, who our parents are, who our ancestors are,\u201d Chang says. Turning to one\u2019s own cultural history through cooking, he says, serves as a source of vital connection with the divine.In January, Chang collaborated with Erin Wilkins, founder of Bay Area\u2013based herbal medicine shop and clinic Herb Folk, for a series of popular online workshops. Each class focuses on the relationship between Asian foods and folk traditions by discussing how spiritual and philosophical Chinese medicine concepts appear in common dishes (such as the circulating life force known as qi in dashi and root vegetable broth).\u201cIt\u2019s been a really beautiful, healing experience, taking the time to dig in and develop my ancestral recipes,\u201d Wilkins says. Until the pandemic, she hadn\u2019t deeply explored the nonclinical side of her practice, but the results have been as spiritually fulfilling as they are delicious. \u201cI learned to make a bomb Japanese curry during quarantine that just warms my soul.\u201dSpiritual nourishment is, after all, nothing without taste. Whether you\u2019re a kitchen witch or a trained herbalist, conjuring the right flavors is key. \u201cIt doesn't matter what the magical properties are,\u201d says Markham, \u201cif it doesn\u2019t taste good, it\u2019s not going to work for you.\u201d But that\u2019s where the beauty in the practice lies. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the outcome of something,\u201d she says, \u201cyou have the power to change the recipe.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishTrendsRead MoreLifestyleAstrology Apps and Tarot Cards: My Pandemic Search for CertaintyBy MacKenzie Chung FeganRecipes you want to make.
