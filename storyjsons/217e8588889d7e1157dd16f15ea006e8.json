Whether he\u2019s cooking a whole side of beef over burning logs on his private island in Patagonia (yes, really) or simply sizzling a side of mushrooms, the Seven Fires author has learned that the best results come when you take your time. One of his specialties: a 12-hour grilled whole pineapple, which he offers as a seasonal dessert at Los Fuegos in Miami Beach. The end result is fruit so meltingly tender you can eat it down to the core, Mallmann\u2019s favorite part. Read on to find out exactly how the chef prepares the pineapple, and how he spends his time as he\u2019s waiting for it to be done.What\u2019s your favorite thing to grill?As you can imagine, I love grilling meat: lamb, pork, and so on. I love grilling calamari, or cooking halved cut lobsters right on the coals. I\u2019ll make cakes on the grill\u2014like a delicious cake of strawberries and other red fruits, with a bit of cr\u00e8me anglaise on the side.Where did you get the inspiration to grill pineapple?Pineapple is very sweet and harsh, but when you cook it very slowly and toast it on every side and on the bottoms, it becomes like a confit. What I do with a pineapple is every hour I\u2019ll just dip it into a pineapple syrup as it cooks, so it comes out soaked, and then it keeps on grilling for another hour. [At Los Fuegos by Francis Mallmann in Miami] we\u2019ll do that like, 12 times. At the restaurant we probably cook 20 pineapples all at the same time.Just look at the caramelized, golden skin.\nPhoto by Alex LauDoes the pineapple hold its shape after 12 hours of cooking?Oh, yeah. It shrinks quite a bit, but even a pineapple, which is very, very hard, becomes tender. We take care to get beautiful, really nice caramelized brown sides all around it, so when you cut a slice of it you\u2019ll see all these crunchy parts on the outside. We serve it with a plop of mascarpone or ice cream, and I love to serve it with a big spoonful of quince jelly that we make.What do you do to keep busy as you cook?If I have family or friends for dinner, I\u2019ll start cooking around 8am for them. I\u2019ll take a chair, beautiful books, flowers; I make it very comfortable and plan to have lunch there and spend my whole day there. You have to enjoy your own company.What\u2019s the most common mistake you see grillers make?The most common error is flipping and flopping things constantly, which is extremely bad. You only flip food once. You turn it once. And you always respect the first contact that whatever you\u2019re cooking has with the hot surface. If it\u2019s a skillet, if it\u2019s a grill, wherever you drop it, it has to stay there until you decide you\u2019re going to flip it only one time.Explore Bon App\u00e9titGrillPineappleRead MorecookingSorry, Mom\u2014These 39 Fruit Salad Recipes Are Actually GoodGallery39 SlidesBy Elyssa GoldbergcookingHere's How to Not Set Grilled Food on FireBy Alex DelanyRecipes you want to make.
