If you\u2019ve been afraid to cook salmon, this is a foolproof way to get started.By Alyse WhitneyNovember 6, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Caleb Adams, Food Styling by Rhoda Boone and Jennifer OphirFacebookTwitterEmailOne of my 2018 goals was to cook more fish at home. (It also happened to be the year that I moved into a studio apartment, so my kitchen is only about 10 feet away from my bed. Nothing like the scent of halibut on your pillow when you lie down to sleep!)I was dragging on my resolution a bit, but then I made our new crispy-skin salmon with miso-honey sauce, and now it\u2019s all I want to eat. The cook time is also just about 10 minutes, and if I open my window and have some a candle going, I can usually combat any wafting fish smells. (I promise that the recipe is a lot more appetizing than this description. Let\u2019s get onto that, shall we?)The trick to not overcooking salmon is to only cook it on one side for most of the way. This is a technique also used for my favorite pork chop recipe\u2014residual heat is really neat!!!! You also start it in a cold pan without any oil so the salmon skin can gently render its own fat and crisp up without aggressively cooking the flesh. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s time to give the salmon a flip once you look at the side of a fillet and it\u2019s cooked about halfway up. And if you want to set yourself a timer, it\u2019s about five minutes of skin-side down until you can sing \u201cwhoa, we\u2019re halfway there, whoa, livin\u2019 on a prayer.\u201dHere\u2019s the thing, though\u2014five minutes isn\u2019t an exact number. It depends on if you\u2019re actually using a cast-iron pan (which holds heat better than nonstick), if your heat is on true medium or a little lower or higher, and the thickness of the fillet. I used my favorite Made In stainless steel pan because it conducts heat well and I don\u2019t own a cast-iron (I gave it away when I moved because it was too heavy and I\u2019m lazy about seasoning it, so sue me!) and it turned out great. Nonstick would be fine, but the skin won't get quite as crispy.Instead of smoked salmon, I love making rice bowls with cold leftover roasted salmon.\nAlex LauThe important thing is to not flip your salmon until it releases on its own\u2014if the skin is stuck, it needs more time. Let the salmon tell you when it\u2019s ready to move on. Once you flip it (preferably with a flexible fish spatula), turn off the stove and take the pan off the heat. The residual heat will finish cooking it while you grab a platter, spoon the tangy, sweet and salty miso-ginger-honey sauce on a platter. Or, if you\u2019re dining solo like I was, just swoosh some sauce on the plate, add salmon, and sprinkle with scallions and toasted sesame seeds.A pro tip that we\u2019d never print in a recipe but I wholeheartedly endorse: Take the crispy skin off the other three fillets of salmon and eat them dipped in miso-ginger sauce if you\u2019re not cooking for a crowd. They will get soggy in the fridge anyway, so might as well have a little extra snack for yourself. I used cold leftovers in a crispy rice salad with mushrooms the next day, and for breakfast the following morning on top of toast with whipped cream cheese and scallions. I have one fillet left and I\u2019m not sick of salmon, my apartment smells like my favorite Cider Lane candle from Bath and Body Works, and I\u2019m already thinking about how I\u2019ll add salmon into my weeknight dinner lineup next week.
