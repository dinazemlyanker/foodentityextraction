She\u2019s a striking sight at the Museum of Food and Drink in Brooklyn, where she\u2019s demonstrating how to make perfect brown rice.\u201cI wish there were more words to describe rice in Japanese,\u201d she says. \u201cWine has this brilliant vocabulary. Rice is just this common thing that you don\u2019t give attention to, unfortunately.\u201dNakamura is hoping to make people more discerning about an ingredient that\u2019s often considered a blank canvas against which the rest of a meal shines. For her brown rice subscription service, Kiki Musubi (in Japanese kiki refers to \u201cseason\u201d and \u201cmemory,\u201d while musubi is a nod to both \u201cconnections\u201d and \u201crice ball\u201d), Nakamura roves the Japanese countryside, meeting small farmers and hand-selecting from the country\u2019s 300 varietals. Every 15 days she dispatches a seasonally appropriate blend, free of chemicals and pesticides, in 500-gram packets or 1 or 2 kilos. In summer, she chooses varietals that are more nutty, light, and toothsome. In winter, they\u2019re dense and chewy, with large grains similar to mochi.Momoko Nakamura provides 100 subscribers across the world with seasonal rice blends.\nPhoto by Waki HamatsuThese tiny grains of rice represent Nakamura\u2019s large ambitions. She\u2019s trying to change the minds of both Japanese farmers (who prefer the easier and more lucrative work of farming with pesticides) and consumers (who see brown rice as more expensive and harder to cook than white rice), in the face of a half-century of plummeting rice consumption in Japan; the average person now eats less than half the amount of rice annually as in 1962.The steep decline dates back to the 1950s, when the U.S. government provided flour as food aid after World War II. Japan subsequently served bread in school lunches; this generation was the first to eat bread for at least one daily meal. A Western diet centered on bread, meat, and dairy was promoted as essential to strong bodies. It was even advertised that eating rice made one less intelligent.In 2011, for the first time, Japanese families spent more on bread than on rice. Today\u2019s turn away from rice is due to, among other factors, a growing preference for fast meals (noodles or bread take mere minutes to prepare) and an increasing trend of family members living separately instead of several generations under one roof\u2014traditional meals of rice, miso soup, and a coterie of side dishes might seem like too much work for solo diners or small families.Preservation is at the core of Nakamura\u2019s work. She maintains that a love for rice remains ingrained in the Japanese. \u201cEvery child in Japan has fond memories around rice,\u201d she says (hers is the smell of rice cooking). And she\u2019s deeply concerned about both the environmental damage wrought by commercial farming, and the way in which it has stripped rice of its taste, texture, and terroir. She even wears a yukata daily out of support for the artisans who make the apparel, an extremely rare fashion choice for someone her age. \u201cEven my mom thinks it\u2019s a bit strange,\u201d she laughs.Nakamura, 37, grew up between the United States and Japan. She worked as a TV food show producer in New York for many years before settling in Tokyo three years ago. It struck her that the Japanese tend to be \u201cincredibly discerning\u201d in taste, from decor to wine to coffee, but that rice\u2014a thing people ate three times a day or more\u2014was \u201ca bit of an ignored topic.\u201d And people are loathe to invest in it. \u201cThe masses want the cheapest rice even though they'll spend lots on their daily coffee,\u201d she says, estimating that her rice, which starts at $290 for a single season, up to $2,300 for a year, comes out to 25 cents a bowl. Refrigerated, the dry rice will last a year or longer.Now a year old, Kiki Musubi has about 100 subscribers across Japan, the U.S. (mainly New York and Los Angeles), Europe, Singapore, and Hong Kong; most come from word of mouth or Instagram. She characterizes her clientele as \u201cmothers with young children, health fanatics, and grandmothers who wonder why rice doesn't taste the same anymore.\u201dYoko Iwaki, one of Nakamura\u2019s subscribers in Manhattan, grew up in California preferring brown rice, which she concedes was unusual. \u201cMy grandparents\u2019 generation doesn\u2019t eat brown rice because during the war they had to eat it to survive.\u201d Brown rice was perceived as less luxurious. \u201cBut there was a sweetness and texture to it that I liked.\u201dThrough the rice subscription, she\u2019s explored a Japanese heritage she\u2019s long been interested in but finds hard to approach. \u201cI realized how disconnected I was from tradition and culture, and the way our ancestors used to eat,\u201d says Iwaki, 37, who comes from a line of rice farmers. \u201cMy peers in Japan and Japanese Americans I speak to are curious about those things but we don't know where to start. Finding people like Momoko who make that accessible is a game-changer.\u201dNakamura includes a small gift to cook with the rice\u2014glass noodles, hijiki, kombu, potato starch, glutens for miso soup\u2014and Iwaki sometimes asks her mother to explain an unfamiliar ingredient (mochi awan, for example, a foxtail-like grain that\u2019s added to rice): \u201cIt's been a special connection for us.\u201dNakamura\u2019s ultimate goal, whether through Kiki Musubi or other means, is to try to preserve Japanese rice farmed in a traditional natural way and ensure it continues into the next generation. \u201cI want people to know how brilliantly diverse it is,\u201d she says. This spring, subscribers can expect to receive soft and light blends with names like \u201cRain Water\u201d and \u201cInsects Awaken.\u201d The summer will bring light and firm varietals meant to be cooked on high heat. And she's always looking for new farmers and new varietals to supply. As Nakamura puts it, \u201cI'm a little bit of a crazy when it comes to rice.\u201dSubscribe to Kiki Musubi here.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
