First up: How long are you supposed to preheat your oven?If you\u2019ve got an oven that alerts you when it\u2019s finished preheating, lucky you. For the rest of us, it\u2019s a little bit of guess-and-check, a lot of patience, and some fancy oven envy. The whole situation is even more fraught if you don\u2019t have an oven thermometer yet. (Yeah, you should probably get on that.) Whether you\u2019re trying to budget time before dinner, have a less-than-flashy oven, or just don\u2019t trust your machine\u2019s calibration, we\u2019ve got answers.How long should you preheat the oven?Instead of waiting around and wondering if your oven is at temperature, remember that the magic number for preheat time is 20 minutes\u2014that\u2019s the ideal time to cover a vast variety of preheating needs. You could certainly preheat for more time depending on the needs of what you\u2019re baking (more on that later), but for most baking projects, preheating for longer than 30 minutes isn\u2019t doing added good and won\u2019t accomplish much beyond driving up your utility bill.A couple of factors affect the preheating time. The higher the desired temperature, the longer it takes to get there (say 450\u00b0 F vs. 350\u00b0 F); a bigger oven may also take a touch more time because there\u2019s more air to heat up. But because the majority of baking projects usually happen between 350\u00b0F and 375\u00b0F, 20 minutes is a good average time to get your oven up to speed.The exception to the rule\u2026While 20 minutes of preheat time is a good rule of thumb for most everyday cooking, some situations may require longer. If you\u2019re sliding pizza or pie crusts onto a heavy steel or lowering a sourdough boule into a Dutch oven or cloche, you need to preheat long enough for the vessel itself to heat all the way through. This ensures it\u2019s hot enough to hold on to and transfer heat to the food via conduction (for you students in the front row). In these cases, account for about 45 minutes for your preheat time.Why is it important to preheat your oven?Maybe you\u2019re the sort of person who is asking yourself the existential question: Why do I even need to preheat the oven anyway? Let\u2019s back up a little.\u00a0Your oven is essentially a metal box with a pocket of air in the center. When you turn it on, gas or electricity kicks in, firing up the heating elements until the air reaches whatever temperature the oven is set to. It\u2019s the languid circulation of this hot air that cooks the food. (Well, the heat pinging off the sides of the oven also plays a small role, but that\u2019s a physics lesson for another time.) The time it takes for the air to reach the desired temperature is your preheat time.When food hits a hot oven, a near-instantaneous series of reactions and transformations occur due to the heat. The natural sugars in your vegetables start to caramelize; the yeast in that loaf of sourdough bread (are we still doing that?) goes into overdrive; cookies set around the edges; and butter melts and steams, puffing up the rapidly setting layers of pie dough. Without that immediate blast of heat, none of this would happen effectively.Think of putting batter or dough in a cold oven like cooking a batch of pancakes without heating the pan or griddle first. You\u2019ll get there eventually but the pancakes will likely be unevenly cooked, completely misshapen, and devastatingly flat. You need that immediate kiss of heat to set the batter and kickstart the leavener into airy bubbles.When do you not need to preheat the oven?Here\u2019s a secret: You don\u2019t always have to preheat your oven (even if the recipe says to). Any dish that doesn\u2019t involve any rising or leavening like, say, baked mac and cheese can go into a cold oven\u2014it will turn out just fine because it doesn\u2019t rely on those initial chemical reactions. Dishes with a lot of moisture (think lasagna or casseroles like pi\u00f1on or shepherd\u2019s pie) and dishes with a long cook time (such as a braise, like my Burnt Orange and Coriander Roast Pork) can also withstand the extra 20 or so minutes you\u2019ll need to tack on if you didn\u2019t preheat the oven first.And in some cases, skipping the preheat will actually enable you to get a more even cook. My favorite example is oven-toasted nuts. Starting them off in a cold oven gives the natural fat in the nuts enough time to gradually warm up and come to the surface, resulting in a more even, tawny roast.Armed with this knowledge, go forth and bake, my preheating Padawans.Explore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
