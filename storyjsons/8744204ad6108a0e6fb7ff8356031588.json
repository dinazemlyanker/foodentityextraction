Not because it\u2019s bad. But because it\u2019s not regular milk. It\u2019s sweetened condensed milk. Which begs the question: What is sweetened condensed milk, anyway? It\u2019s weirdly thick (thicccc) and sticky and kind of looks like Elmer\u2019s glue. In short: It looks gross. But if you\u2019re putting it in things, not just drinking it from the can, it\u2019s not gross at all. Let\u2019s break down the two words in the name and learn a bit about this dairy-based concoction.Condensed: How do you condense milk? You don\u2019t shove it into a small room (or a trash compactor, for all you Star Wars heads out there). And you don\u2019t abbreviate it to MLK in the fashion of some millennial tech start-up. Milk is condensed by removing water via heat. You\u2019ll probably recognize that process as evaporation. Yes! The part of the water cycle where liquid water turns to a gas that we learned about in fifth grade science! Condensed just means that the milk was cooked down in order to remove some of the water from it, the same way you would cook down a stock or a sauce to concentrate its flavor.Sweetened: Yeah, you guessed it. There\u2019s sugar added to sweetened condensed milk. The main purpose of adding sugar is to prolong the shelf life of condensed milk, which can sit on room temperature shelves for years. Sugar prevents microorganisms from growing in the milk and helps to thicken it even further\u2014it's added after the milk has been boiled, reduced, and effectively pasteurized.It\u2019s also worth noting that there is unsweetened condensed milk, but that\u2019s usually referred to as \"evaporated milk.\" You shouldn\u2019t substitute one for the other. They are apples and oranges, as the saying goes.No sweetened condensed milk, no rich, delicious shakerato.\nAlex LauSo why do we use this thick, sticky stuff? Well, if you read the stuff we wrote above, you kind of already know. It provides a concentrated creaminess and sweet, milky flavor to whatever you put it in, without all the excess moisture that you get from regular old milk. That makes it perfect for creamy things that you want to set to a near-solid, like key lime pie, fudge, frozen margarita pie, or caramel. It\u2019s also one of the three milks in tres leches cake and a common addition to homemade ice cream. And on the drink front, it shows up frequently in coffee drinks like Vietnamese iced coffee or a Spanish caf\u00e9 bomb\u00f3n, both of which are excellent dessert beverages.But here\u2019s the basic rule: You can use sweetened condensed milk in any scenario where you want both sugar and cream. Coffee. Tea. Coconut curries. Toasts. Fruit. Pies. Ice cream. It\u2019s a versatile ingredient that no one give that much thought to. Except for you. With this knowledge, you\u2019re the champion of the sweetened condensed milk universe. But remember: Don\u2019t drink it straight. Please.Now, how about you crack open a can and make some Frozen Margarita Pie?Frozen Margarita PieYour favorite cocktail in pie form\u2014what's not to love?View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyMilkDessertCoffeeRecipes you want to make.
