The sauce, which has nutty tahini, savory miso, and soy milk, is just thick enough to cling to each noodle, but it's light enough to be full-on slurpable. Add ribbons of protein-packed yuba (tofu skin) on top and you've got a nourishing, feel-good bowl.Yuba, or tofu skin, is actually a by-product of the tofu-making process\u2014when large vats of soy milk are heated for making tofu, the soy proteins coagulate to form a delicate skin that rises to the milk's surface and gets skimmed off. The resulting yuba has a mildly nutty flavor and bouncy elastic texture. Tofu skin is sold fresh or dried, but fresh yuba (such as the one by Hodo Foods) is typically sold in pliable, folded-up sheets that you can slice into \u201cnoodles,\" as in this recipe, or tear up and add to soups, salads, or stir-fries. Look for fresh yuba in the refrigerated section near the tofu at Asian markets or well-stocked grocery stores.

I was excited about the addition of miso because I love miso, but in my opinion, the flavors just didn't work together. I had to add chili oil for this to be palatable, and still didn't enjoy eating it. Wouldn't make again.lasagnaqueenPortland, Oregon3/25/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titDinnerLunchEasyQuickWeeknightAsianHealthyishVeganVegetarianDairy-FreeMisoCondiments, Sauces & PastesNoodlePasta & NoodlesUdon NoodleTahiniMainRecipes you want to make.
