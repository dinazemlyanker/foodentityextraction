Then the pandemic hit.By Parnass Savang, as told to Hilary CadiganSeptember 30, 2020FacebookTwitterPinterestPhoto by Emma FishmanFacebookTwitterPinterestThis article is part of our series on how restaurants changed in 2020, and why we've never loved them more. Click to see all the stories.On weekends in high school, while my friends went to football games, I washed dishes at my parents\u2019 restaurant, Danthai. All I wanted was to get away. It\u2019s that first-generation thing: I grew up in a Thai bubble, then when I got to school, English replaced my mother tongue. School lunches were my education on American food: cheddar Sun Chips, pizza, really overcooked green beans. That\u2019s what I was excited about. At their restaurant my parents tempered our family recipes to fit into a predominantly white community. It wasn\u2019t the food they loved. It was the food that sold.I went to culinary school because I watched Gordon Ramsay on YouTube. I wanted to give my dad\u2019s restaurant the Kitchen Nightmares treatment. But once I got to New York and started cooking French food, all I could think about were the things my parents made at home\u2014lad na, sai ua\u2014the things I always took for granted. So I made a 10-year plan: After culinary school I\u2019d go back to Atlanta, work with all the best chefs (including my parents!), get to know the farmers, then open a Thai restaurant. One that challenged perceptions of what Thai food could be but never compromised.Somehow I\u2019ve stuck to the plan. My friend Rod Lassiter and I started Talat Market as a pop-up three years ago; by March 2020 we were days away from opening our brick-and-mortar. Then the pandemic hit.Takeout was a big part of my parents\u2019 business, like it is for most Thai American restaurants. Growing up I spent hours packing Styrofoam boxes full of pad thai. But working in high-end restaurants made me look down on to-go. Dining was about the plating, the presentation. You ate out to get the full experience, and that\u2019s what I wanted for Talat. I wanted to transport people. I wanted an open kitchen so diners could watch our process\u2014the pressing of the fresh coconut milk, the way the egg puffs up when you pour it into hot oil. I wanted Thai luk thung music playing over the speakers. I wanted tables with dinky plastic stools where guests could linger for hours like they would on a street in Chiang Mai. But now, in order to survive, restaurants must adapt, and that means serving our food to-go.I\u2019m trying to look on the bright side. Rod and I see this as a chance to focus on the flavors, the techniques, the stories\u2014what you\u2019re left with when everything else is stripped away. My yum phonlamai, a savory Thai-style fruit salad, is a throwback to my mom, whose parents made a living sell-ing pineapples in Bangkok. My red curry is an homage to my dad, who learned it from his mom. And the seasonal Georgia produce in all my dishes is a nod to my Thai American upbringing, how I was raised between two worlds.So yeah, I\u2019m still waiting on my dream restaurant. But in the meantime I know that the food we serve\u2014whether it\u2019s on a ceramic plate or in a cardboard to-go box\u2014will never compromise.The recipes keeping his dream afloat:\u00a0Photo by Emma Fishman1/6Fall LarbA rebellious take on a Thai classic, made with butternut squash, carrots, and parsnips.View RecipePhoto by Emma Fishman2/6Geng Dang MuuThe curry and ground pork reference the origins of the dish, while the brussels sprouts and leeks are a nod to the local ingredients of Georgia.View RecipePhoto by Emma Fishman3/6Khai JiaoAn ultralight and puffy Thai omelet with crispy golden brown edges.View RecipePhoto by Emma Fishman4/6Yum PhonlamaiThe interplay between the fish sauce, chiles, and sweet juicy fruits makes this a simple but refreshing dish.View RecipePhoto by Emma Fishman5/6Sai Ua Samun PhraiA vibrant Thai sausage made with ground chicken, plus a spicy chile dip.View RecipePhoto by Emma Fishman6/6Phat Sii Krong NeuaThinly sliced flanken-cut short ribs, packed with rich flavor, are the key to this Thai stir-fry.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titThaiRestaurantsCoronavirusFirst PersonRecipes you want to make.
