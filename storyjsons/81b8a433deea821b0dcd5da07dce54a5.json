What in tarnation are those?Fronds are those cute frilly green leafy things attached to the stalks that grow out of a fennel bulb. They kind of look like fresh dill, and they have a texture that\u2019s light and feathery. If you tickled someone with fennel fronds, they\u2019d probably giggle. And then tell you to stop.The flavor of fennel fronds is very similar to the bulb that they come with. Fennel tastes a bit like licorice, equal parts bright and vegetal, and when you roast or caramelize fennel, it develops a natural sweetness that balances out its bitterness. The fronds boast that same anise-forward flavor, but taste more...green, if that makes any sense, with a more delicate texture.If you're making a fennel salad, mix the fronds right in there too.\nPhoto by Stephen Kent Johnson, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiRemoving the fronds from the stalks is as easy as it sounds\u2014just pull 'em off!\u2014and incorporating them into dishes, especially dishes where you're already using fennel bulb, is a no-brainer. We use them in the same way we\u2019d use other fresh, soft herbs like parsley or dill. You can mix chopped fennel fronds into pestos, salsas, stocks, curries, and vinaigrettes for an added hit of freshness. You can use them to top yogurt dips, eggs, stir-fries, toasts, and seared meats. And they're delicious when tossed into green salads or strewn on top of roasted vegetables.There are a ton of ways to take advantage of the delicate flavor that fennel fronds have to offer. It really doesn\u2019t matter what you do with them, as long as it\u2019s something. We just want to make sure you\u2019re not missing out on nature\u2019s finest deal: fennel fronds.You can also stir them into olive oil to make fennel oil, like in this recipe:One-Skillet Lemony Chicken with Fennel and TomatoesThis simple, satisfying one-skillet chicken recipe leaves you with a ton of sweet, sweet pan juices\u2014plenty of crusty bread for sopping it all up is non-negotiable.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyFennelherbIngredientsRecipes you want to make.
