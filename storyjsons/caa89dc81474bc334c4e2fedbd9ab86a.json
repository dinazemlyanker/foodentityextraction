This is arguably the best time of year to shop (lots of sales but no holiday season pressure), and at Nordstrom today until August 8, you can score deals on everything from whiskey glasses and chic coasters for your next dinner party to aromatherapy diffusers and coconut-apricot candles that\u2019ll help you chill the f*ck out. Below, I\u2019ve gathered some of the best kitchenware discounts you can find on the web right now. And though I can\u2019t tell you exactly what to cop, I can inform you that your dream indoor garden awaits.Hydro Flask Water BottleOf all our favorite insulated water bottles, the Hydro Flask is by far the best one for taking on long hikes. Unlike other insulated bottles, this one is equipped with a wide mouth that makes it easy to pack with ice cubes and a flexible carrying strap so you can hydrate on the go. Grab an extra for your favorite VSCO Girl (is that still a thing?).Photo courtesy of Nordstrom16-Ounce Hydro Flask Wide Mouth Cap Bottle$38 $28 at NordstromHestan Nanobond Three-Piece SetHestan\u2019s stainless-steel cookware conducts heats like a boss, is incredibly durable, and\u2014we hate to say it but it\u2019s true\u2014has \u201cdisrupted\u201d the pots and pans marketplace. Just ask test kitchen director Chris Morocco, who reaches for the Hestan Nanobond 3.5-quart lidded saucepan more than any other pan in his arsenal. This set includes the saucepan and a 12.5-inch skillet.Photo courtesy of NordstromHestan Nanobond Three-Piece Set$790 $500 at NordstromClick & Grow Indoor GardenSay it with me: I will not allow a lack of space to prevent me from channeling my inner Kelis. You deserve a self-watering smart garden that\u2019s equipped with a water reservoir, LED lamp, and basil starter pods to kick-start your green thumb journey. If you\u2019re committed to growing your own salad bar, opt for the big boy version, which comes with tomato and lettuce pods in addition to the basil and has space for nine plants.Photo courtesy of NordstromClick & Grow Smart Garden 3$100 at Nordstrom$100 $75 at Click & GrowMalin + Goetz Votive Candle SetWe love Malin + Goetz's candles\u2014especially the ones that are inspired by food, drinks, and\u2026herbs. This set features three votive candles in dark rum, leather, and cannabis.Photo courtesy of NordstromMalin + Goetz Votive Candle Set$60 $42 at NordstromAarke Sparkling Water MakerNothing says partaaay like a sleek sparkling water maker that fits on your countertop. This Scandi-designed at-home carbonator produces 60 liters of perfect bubbly water from one CO2 canister, and unlike its competitors, it\u2019s so handsome it\u2019s practically an objet. All you\u2019ve got to do is add some ice and citrus juice\u2014and maybe a little vodka\u2014and the party has begun.Photo courtesy of NordstromAarke Sparkling Water Maker$249 $164 at Nordstrom$219 $164 at AmazonFellow Electric KettleIf you don\u2019t have a gooseneck kettle and are looking to up your pour-over coffee game, here\u2019s your chance. With a subtle matte finish and modern, minimalist design, this is an electric kettle you\u2019ll gladly keep on the counter for all eyes to see. It also has unbeatable precision. Select any temperature between 135\u00b0F and 212\u00b0F, and it\u2019ll maintain your desired temp for an hour.Photo courtesy of NordstromFellow Electric Kettle$169 $120 at NordstromWine RackBe a person who has bottles of wine casually lying around instead of the person (me) perpetually running to the wine shop five minutes before they close. Then display those bottles in this gold-toned metal wine rack.Photo courtesy of NordstromWine Rack$49 $30 at NordstromViking Cast-Iron GriddlePancakes for two? Your cast-iron skillet will get the job done. But if you\u2019re feeding a crowd, you need this reversible cast-iron griddle and grill. Sized to straddle two burners, it\u2019ll handle French toast and fried eggs on one side and steaks and burgers on the other.Photo courtesy of NordstromViking Cast-Iron Griddle$100 $70 at NordstromFood52 Ultimate ApronThis super-functional, 100% cotton apron is like a Batman suit for serious cooks.
