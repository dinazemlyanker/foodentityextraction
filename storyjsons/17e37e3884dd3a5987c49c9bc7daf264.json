On a good week I\u2019ll eat it at least three times; on a bad week, one. Which is why I knew I had to check out Kismet Rotisserie the last time I was in Los Angeles. It\u2019s run by two very talented chefs, Sara Kramer and Sarah Hymanson\u2014the duo behind Kismet, an all-day California-meets-the-Mediterranean restaurant right down the street. Knowing their commitment to perfection, I had high expectations for their burnished bird. But I didn\u2019t expect to be so blown away by each little side dish that came with it. Garlicky toum! Farmers market pickles! Schmaltzy potatoes! It was all so good, I could see working the spot into a five-times-a-week schedule\u2014if I didn\u2019t live so far away. And I\u2019m not the only one.According to Kramer, business has flourished since she and Hymanson adjusted their restaurant to be reliant on takeout and delivery when COVID-19 hit. (Through donations they have also been feeding frontline workers, in partnership with Frontline Foods, and a local women\u2019s shelter.) \u201cWe\u2019re grateful to feed our community right now,\u201d Kramer told me over the phone.Here\u2019s what goes into the half chicken tray keeping Kismet Rotisserie (and hungry Los Angelenos) going.The ChickenAfter testing 20 chicken breeds and 15 dry rubs, the chefs found their dream duo. They went with a small free-range bird, great for absorbing the secret spice mix (we hear there is turmeric and Aleppo-style pepper). After brining the chickens overnight, they \u00a0slide them into a Dor\u00e9grill La Rotisserie, the French machine used at every poulet r\u00f4ti joint in Paris. The end result: golden brown skin every time.The PicklesThe farmers market dictates the house-made pickles (beets! radishes!). But for the pickled cucumbers and spicy peppers, the chefs go with store-bought Middle Eastern versions. \u201cThey\u2019re perfect just the way they are,\u201d Kramer says. \u00a0The WedgeAs much as this salad is defined by the crisp iceberg, Kismet\u2019s is all about the miso-poppy seed dressing. It\u2019s a nod to the \u201990s health food the Sara(h)s both grew up on and balances out all the rich flavors with its tang.The Chile OilFor their version of a Chinese chile crisp, the chefs take the usual dried chiles, fried garlic, and oil and throw in some of their fave Moroccan spices, like cinnamon.The HummusThe secret to this satiny hummus? Soaking, braising, then peeling (!) high-quality dried chickpeas before whirring them in a turbocharged food processor.\u00a0The ToumThis punchy Lebanese sauce is typically made with just raw garlic and oil, but Hymanson and Kramer add blanched garlic to give it silky body.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsNeighborhood Restaurantsroast chickenDish DecodedRead MorerestaurantsHow Do I Love Thee, Chinese Sponge Cake?
