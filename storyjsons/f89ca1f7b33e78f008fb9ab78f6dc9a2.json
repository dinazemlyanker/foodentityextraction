Hall starts with her Smoked Paprika and Sun-Dried Tomato Potlikker as a rich, smoky flavor foundation, then adds Kalamata olives, lemon zest, and fresh herbs for bright, uplifting notes. Making the Smoked Paprika and Sun-Dried Tomato Potlikker is a crucial step here, so be sure to read through that recipe first.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Thank you, Carla! AnonymousHawaii3/6/2022This was really tasty and super easy! I made the potlikker a few days ago while I was cooking something else so everything came together quickly. I only needed to braise them for 12 minutes before I got an internal reading of 165 but otherwise it was a perfect recipe. Throw some more pepper flakes in if you like a kick-- I always use Aleppo. LuluPittsburgh2/25/2022The recipe looks amazing, however, for the final covered simmering isn\u2019t the chicken likely to lose its crispy skin? Could it not be finished uncovered in the oven or uncovered on top? I guess the key is just getting it to 165\u00b0\u2026KipToronto 2/23/2022Wonderful!AnonymousBeavercreek, OH2/18/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titDinnerEasyWeeknight MealsGluten-FreeDairy-FreeNut-FreeChicken ThighChickenPoultryOliveOther IngredientsBraiseMainRecipes you want to make.
