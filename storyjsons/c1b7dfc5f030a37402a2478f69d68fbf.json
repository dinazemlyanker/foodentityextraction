At Marrow in Detroit, a butcher shop by day, restaurant by night, butcher Nicholas Ponte and his team sell low-key sandwiches for lunch\u2014first come, first get. And they only make 10 a day! They\u2019re not advertised on any menu or blasted on social media. Instead, you can find them wrapped in butcher paper around noon, tucked into a refrigerated case to the left of the bar, by the p\u00e2t\u00e9s and fancy butters and cans of pop. They use whatever they need to move: smoked ham, housemade mortadella and salami, roast beef, spicy pickle-y condiments, and anything else that\u2019ll minimize the restaurant\u2019s food waste. (They also make a few vegetarian sandwiches, which might have marinated tempeh, kimchi, green onions, and sunflower butter (pictured top left)!).On a recent afternoon, I got the last sandwich of the day. The sturdy bread from Zingerman\u2019s was insulated with mayo that escaped through the bread\u2019s holes. (A sandwich with too much mayo is a sandwich with the right amount of mayo.) Inside, thinly sliced smoked ham was stacked like a crowd pushing butt-to-back through the turnstiles of a free Seger concert. Big leaves of spinach served their healthful, crispy purpose. The pickled chiles were spicy, sweet, and tangy. At $12, you get this huge sandwich, easily shareable. A sandwich from Marrow is one of the best takeaway lunches in town, especially if you add a bag of Great Lakes salt and vinegar chips and a can of Vernors.Tag yourself\u2014I\u2019m the layer of yellow chiles.\nPhoto by Michelle GerardBut you\u2019re not done yet. You\u2019re here, aren\u2019t you? You cannot leave that butcher shop without a souvenir, so I\u2019ll highly recommend the butterkase-filled kielbasa called k\u00e4sekrainer. That\u2019s a smoked sausage with a melty, creamy German cheese as buttery as its name suggests\u2014the sausage equivalent of a Juicy Lucy. You want it. You need it. But first, sandwiches.Go there: MarrowExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendDetroitSandwichRead MorerestaurantsAn Adult-Sized Hangover Calls for the XL Breakfast Sandwich at Philly\u2019s Hungry PigeonBy Emily SchultzRecipes you want to make.
