In its place, choose another firm-fleshed type, such as cod, halibut, or salmon.Ingredients2 servings4tablespoons olive oil, divided1\u201321-inch-thick swordfish steaks (about 1\u00bd pounds total)Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper\u00bdsmall red onion, finely chopped4oil-packed anchovy fillets, drained, finely chopped215-ounce cans cherry tomatoes, drained2tablespoons drained capers2tablespoons Sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar2tablespoons oregano leavesLemon wedges (for serving)PreparationStep 1Heat broiler.

Have to cook the fish separately, as well as the tomatoes. Nice change to plain swordfish. Used champagne/balsamic vinegar. Fresh oregano a little strong for my taste. AnonymousSan Francisco9/5/2021How close should the broiler be to the fish ? 4 inches or 6inches?  I\u2019m sure it makes a difference.EHNew w8/27/2021Fantastic recipe and easy! Made it twice for my husband and my 93-year-old father and they both loved it! DO NOT forego the anchovies! They bring together the sauce and provide an umami that compliments the swordfish so nicely. I did broil the tomatoes for 4 minutes before throwing them in with the onion mixture. And do not overcook this - it keeps cooking just a bit once it sits for a couple minutes. As my late mother would say: Divine!TammyLaguna Beach, CA8/4/2021Amazing. Made with halibut and left out anchovies. This is a new go to for my picky family.carrieolewisSan Francisco9/12/2020Delicious and easy!  I used fresh cherry tomatoes, too, and put them in the broiler for 3-4 minutes before adding the fish.  The fresh oregano is a fantastic garnish.AnonymousBrooklyn, NY8/19/2020This is delicious! I had fresh cherry tomatoes and it worked great to give them a head start as others suggested. I did not have anchovies or capers but I did have a jar of hoagie spread and it was a top notch sub. katematayaDallas, TX6/29/2020You can use fresh cherry tomatoes in the article about her cooking on vacation, she says to give them a head start and get blistered, then toss in swordfish.nagaEarth4/19/2020Just wanted to ask if you can use fresh cherry tomatoes.. or does it not make a difference. Am going to make this dish using Halibut.lynnpratsidesBritish Columbia Canada4/8/2019Please correct me if I am wrong but I thought swordfish was on the list of non-sustainable fish.AnonymousMontreal, Canada4/8/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titSwordfishFishSeafoodCherry TomatoTomatoVegetableCodHalibutWeeknight MealsEasyMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreeBroilDinnerRecipes you want to make.
