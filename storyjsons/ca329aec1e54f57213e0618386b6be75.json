This version was developed by BA\u2019s former test kitchen manager Gaby Melian, who is from Buenos Aires and was taught as a little girl by her mother and grandmother how to make them. She prefers these ones baked, not fried\u2014and the puff pastry dough ensures you\u2019ll still get all of those flaky layers. (If you prefer fried ones, try Gaby\u2019s Ham, Cheese, and Onion Empanadas.)Empanadas have \u201csaved me so many times,\u201d writes Gaby in her step-by-step guide. \u201cBirthday parties? Empanadas. Somebody\u2019s coming over? Empanadas.\u201d Keeping some in the freezer certainly helps. These beef empanadas can hang out there for three months\u2014just be sure to freeze them on a sheet tray first so they don\u2019t stick together.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

My late husband was raised in Argentina & this is his family\u2019s recipe. With one exception\u2026.they added hard boiled eggs. AnonymousOkc ok12/12/2021How do I bake the frozen empanadas?KenCalifornia12/9/2021Goya used to get their dough from Argentina, now the come from Uruguay. As any empanada lover will tell you, it\u2019s the dough. Goya for baking is by far the best you can get in the US.\nAnonymousArgentina11/24/2021I love Goya and Badia. Mccormick is a ripoff with inferior products. There is NO room for politics in the kitchen. Stay in your lane or move to the west coast. AnonymousTampa,FL11/21/2021Can't even look at recipes without you communist libtards being yourself and spreading hate. you should all be ashamed, oh wait you have no empathy and are all narcissist's you have noting in you for being ashamed..  tired of libtardsLubbock, TX 7941011/15/2021We use store-bought pie dough (Pillsbury is the most common) cut into 4\" or 6\" rounds instead of puff pastry, which is closer to street food empanadas found in Argentina and elsewhere in South America. We also use black Alfonso olives instead of green ones, which also seems to be more common in real life.Peter JNew York11/1/2021Love this, I'd agree, you should not use goya, which supports a fascism regim, but looking forward to making more of these, my kids gobble them up. MikeMaryland10/31/2021To Johnny, I\u2019m not a huge fan of cumin either. It\u2019s too strong for my personal taste. You can absolutely cut back on cumin.  Just add a teaspoon and it\u2019ll taste fine. I just add garlic and onion powders for more oomph. As a matter of fact I just add a couple of tablespoons of sofrito to the meat while it\u2019s browning (fresh onion, garlic, red pepper & cilantro - blended) & it comes out perfectly. \nAdd spices that taste good to you. :)DiannaWashington, DC10/31/2021Such stupid people that won\u2019t use Goya, because they don\u2019t like my President Trump.....very childish.....the review is about a recipe not your political communist /socialist association Anonymous10/29/2021I also don't use Goya - they support the Orange guy -\nTell me: what other pastry can I use? What about the 2 round sheets that come in a box to make an apple pie? In Argentina they use 'La Saltena' for the pastry to make empanadas. I tried Goya a long time ago and came out awful. They were thick, dry and hard. Never again.\nAny suggestions? I don't want to make the dough from scratch.\nHELP...... thanksAnonymousN. Syracuse10/12/2021Three Tablespoons of ground Cumin sound excessive for just 2 pounds of ground beef.\nI want to do this recipe but curious if anyone actually used so much cumin as listed.johnny10/3/2021I've been making empanadas (mostly beef) for years, and my friends know that I've put my heart and soul into making them.  My recipe is very similar - I use very lean beef, and often grind my own using steak, I use jalapeno or pasilla peppers for the heat instead of cayenne, and always use golden raisins. No eggs.  My sinful crust is made from flour, butter and cream cheese. I bake mine.  The other unbaked empanadas go into the freezer in bags to pull out as appetizers.  I know it is not traditional to serve sauces, but my killer creamy green sauce with jalapenos, cilantro, sour cream, a bit of mayo is always a hit.  I serve it also with my Peruvian chicken.  PacificaMumPacifica, CA9/30/2021Ditto on Goya. Love the recipe using ingredients from responsible companies. LindaLivingston 9/30/2021I will not use Goya because their CEO is supporting the Big Lie, but I'll definitely try the recipe.DWSnoqualmie, WA9/9/2021Yum! For those of us that don't like Goya, I used Villa D'agri brand pastry, a product of Argentina.  Be careful to get the kind for baking, not the frying variation -- the middle icon on the package shows an oven.
