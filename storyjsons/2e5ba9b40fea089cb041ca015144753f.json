Text and illustration credits (c) 2018 by Tara Jensen and reprinted by permission of St. Martin's Press.EmailPinterestPrintEmailPinterestPrintTara Jensen\u2019s cookbook, A Baker\u2019s Year, closes with an outline of the lunar cycle from new moon to waning crescent, followed by instructions for setting a new moon intention, and recipes for lofty, single layer \u201cmoon cakes\u201d beginning with this full moon cake. \u201cIncorporate all of the ingredients quickly and efficiently, and while it\u2019s baking, sit next to your oven with a clock, a pen, and a notepad. Do not open the oven door for the first 20 minutes of baking. Make notes when the cake becomes golden brown and pulls away slightly from the edges, when the smells of the cake change, and to describe how it\u2019s baking in your pan. Take the time to do some deep breathing and reflect on your recent days. Poke the center of the cake with a knife. When it comes out clean, make a note of the time and pull the cake from the oven. You may forgo the timer and the notepad once you learn the rhythm,\u201d she writes, \u201cbut perhaps you will enjoy it, bringing the ritual of goal-setting and journal writing with you into your baking.\u201d Read more about Jensen\u2019s bakery here.Text and illustration credits (c) 2018 by Tara Jensen and reprinted by permission of St. Martin's Press.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Add cream of tartar and continue to beat until stiff peaks form (do not overbeat; it will dry out the egg whites).Step 6Using a large spatula, fold one-third of egg whites into batter to lighten.
