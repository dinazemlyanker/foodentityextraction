Then she learned she had a year left to live.By  Fatima AliJanuary 25, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPatrick Randak/thelicensingproject.comFacebookTwitterEmailWe are saddened to share that Fatima Ali, a former Top Chef contestant, has died of cancer at age 29. A version of this essay is slated to run in our March print magazine. We are running it early online to share her perspective and honor her memory. Three months ago, Ali wrote for us about how she was spending her remaining months, following her terminal diagnosis. This version expands on her earlier piece.I grew up in Pakistan, where food is a really integral part of the culture. I started cooking with my grandmother when I was six or seven, and she would teach me how to make little bread bears. They had peppercorn eyes and cloves for buttons, and I remember thinking it was such an amazing thing, that I could actually make something with my own hands.After I graduated from the Culinary Institute of America in 2011, my mom wanted me to come home, but I said \u201cJust give me one year in New York City. There's no place better for me to learn.\u201d Every time I\u2019d go back to visit my family in Pakistan, I would cook. Watching me evolve gave my mom comfort, and helped her understand that this was absolutely my calling. So she finally let go, and said, \u201cLook, just promise me that you'll do your absolute best. And I\u2019ll be happy with that.\u201d And I said, \u201cOkay. That\u2019s a promise.\u201dMy first job was at an Indian-Latin restaurant in New York. I was a floor manager and the sous chef at the same time, weirdly enough. So I spent three days in the front, and four days in the back. I was doing seven-day weeks, 14-hour days. I did that for nine months. Later, at another job, my executive chef quit suddenly, as they often do. I was just a 21-year-old junior sous chef, but suddenly in charge of the whole place. I worked breakfast, lunch, dinner, catered all these super-VIP holiday parties. I\u2019d get home at 1 a.m then have to wake up at 4 a.m. for a private breakfast party. One time several cooks called out and then the person who was transporting the catering trays dropped them all onto the pedestrian walk at 45th St. and Lexington Ave. In the middle of lunch rush. We had to remake everything, with all the cooks missing. There were plenty of days like that. But you know what? It was amazing. Managing to get through a day like that\u2014and not only living to tell about it, but doing it again and again\u2014I think it really makes you understand what a human is capable of. We\u2019re so resilient. If I had to do it all again, I wouldn\u2019t change anything.When I got diagnosed with a rare form of cancer called Ewings Sarcoma, I had just finished filming Top Chef in Colorado. It was 2017 and I was working at the U.S. Open with my friend Joe Flamm, who was the winner and had opened up a pop-up restaurant there. I\u2019d had this weird ache in my shoulder for the past couple of months that I\u2019d been ignoring. You know, popping a couple of Advils, going to sleep. But one day, in the middle of lunch, my shoulder swelled up and the pain was mounting literally by the minute. I had to go to the emergency room.They gave me an MRI literally within 20 minutes of seeing me, because I was in so much pain. I remember the doctor was exceptionally handsome. I remember standing over there crying my eyes out and this guy could be on a runway. He calls me on my cell phone and I\u2019m thinking, \u201cOoh, this hot doctor's asking me out.\u201d But instead he says, \u201cI want to refer you to an oncologist.\u201d That was just the beginning. They didn't discharge me from my first hospital admission for three weeks.Honestly, until your first chemo cycle, I don\u2019t think it really hits you. Then your hair starts falling out, and finally you\u2019re like, \u201cThis is actually happening. This is the rest of my life.\u201d I did eight rounds of chemo. It was horrible, but at the end, my scans were all clear. I thought I\u2019d beaten it. Then it came back. Worse than before. It was metastatic. It had spread to my lungs. The doctors told me I had a year to live.The first thing I did when I found out was dye my hair. Platinum blonde. I thought, \u201cI\u2019m dying, so why not?\u201d I felt like I had to reclaim the hair thing. So I called this guy to my hospital room. Then I did one more round of chemo and all my frickin\u2019 hair fell out again.That sucked, but I was like, \u201cYou know what? Stop feeling sorry for yourself.\u201d I\u2018ve been to hospitals in New York and I\u2018ve been to hospitals in LA, and when you\u2018re around that much sickness, and you see people from all sorts of backgrounds, all sorts of ages, in all stages of disease\u2014it really gives you perspective. Because even now, it could be so much worse than it is. I\u2018m still very lucky to be able to do a lot of the things that I love.I decided not to spend whatever time I had left (whether it\u2019s a year, a month, another ten years\u2014you don\u2019t know until you\u2019re gone) lamenting all the things that weren\u2019t right. Instead, I\u2019d make the most of it. I\u2019m using cancer as the excuse I needed to actually go and get things done, and the more people I share those thoughts with, the more I hold myself to them. If I write this intention down, if I have it printed somewhere like I do here, I have to hold myself responsible, because I have people counting on me.What is my intention? To live my life. To fulfill all those genuine dreams I have. It\u2019s easy to spend weeks in my pajamas, curled up in my bed, watching Gossip Girl on Netflix. I could totally do that. And don\u2019t get me wrong, I still watch Gossip Girl. But now I\u2019m doing things. I\u2019m going out to eat. I\u2019m making plans for vacations. I\u2019m finding experimental treatments. I\u2019m cooking. I\u2019m writing.My brother and I have challenged ourselves to write a recipe a day\u2014spaghetti; braised lamb with Pakistani spices and root vegetables; comfort food. Things I like to eat. Things people will actually make. Every day I come up with a recipe I\u2019ve never made before, write it down in a notebook, make a little drawing of it, go shopping for those ingredients, and cook it. My brother wants to compile them all. He\u2019ll turn them into something one day.I\u2019ve also been eating at a lot of restaurants. Vespertine, Sushi Masa, Broken Spanish, Kismet. I went to Eleven Madison Park with my family and the manager, a friend of mine, made a replica of my food stall, VanPakistan, in the kitchen. Down to the tablecloth. Down to the kind of napkin dispenser I had. The chef made the most delicious, melt-in-your-mouth Seekh kebabs I\u2019ve ever had, with flatbread and pickled onions and green chutney they had made just for me. My mom was in tears, bawling. My older brother was crying. Everyone was hugging each other. We were blown away.We\u2019re planning a trip to Europe: Austria, Italy. I want to eat really phenomenal Parmesan and balsamic and fresh buffalo mozzarella and real Italian tomatoes and basil and fresh pasta with good olive oil and great cheese. That\u2019s all I fucking want. Oh, and I DM\u2019d Noma. I was like, \u201cI\u2019m coming to town. I hope even if there aren\u2019t spots, you could make a spot for me.\u201d I received a reply from chef Rene Redzepi himself. Turns out people respond when you tell them you\u2019re dying of cancer.My brother and I were talking the other day and he made an interesting point. He was like, \"As chefs, you guys deal with death every day.\" And he\u2019s right. When you\u2019re a chef, you understand the circle of life. We're butchering rabbits, whole hogs, and baby lambs; we\u2019re filleting fish and cleaning shrimp. All these things have died for us. I suppose you have to see it as the natural progress of life. Perhaps I've had to face it a little bit sooner than expected, but it's not an unfamiliar feeling.There are days that I'm exceptionally afraid. There are days I sit alone and cry, because I don't want to do it in front of my family. And there are other days that we all sit down and cry together, because it is such a scary thing. But at the same time, you can't let that fear cripple you. It's harder being miserable than it is to be happy.As told to Hilary Cadigan on November 28, 2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titFirst PersonChefsRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
