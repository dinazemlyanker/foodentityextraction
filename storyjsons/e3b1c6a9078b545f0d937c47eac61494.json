It's so tangy and delicious. I just used store bought dough instead of making it myself and the pizza was amazing! I also used a cast iron skillet for about 14 minutes in the oven and it turned out great. The sudden heat from the serrano peppers amongst the bed of somewhat soft carrots created a great dish. I would recommend this recipe to anyone.groseoWisconsin4/13/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishWeb RecipeSuperpoweredpizza doughPizzaSugarYeastOther IngredientsFlourParmesanCheeseGarlicVegetableLime JuiceCarrotBasilHerbs & SpicesMintSerrano ChileChilePea ShootLeafy GreensRecipes you want to make.
