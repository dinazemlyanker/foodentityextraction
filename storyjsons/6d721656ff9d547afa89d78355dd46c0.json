The cup of multi-layered goodness delivers an entire dessert menu worth of textures and flavors: custardy, chewy, icy, milky, creamy, and starchy-sweet. The best way to eat halo-halo, Boquila says, is to mix everything together, but I called him up and asked him to break it down for me, one delicious layer at a time.The IceShaved ice makes halo-halo a summer staple. \u201cIt\u2019s hot and humid for most of the year in the Philippines,\u201d says Boquila, who lived there until he was eight. \u201cSo the ice is there to cool you off.\u201d It also balances out the sweetness of the dish.The MilkTraditionally, the shaved ice gets drizzled with sweetened condensed milk, but Boquila adds evaporated milk in a 50/50 ratio to ease up on the sugar.The FlanMost Filipino flan is dense, but Boquila takes more of a cre\u0300me bru\u0302le\u0301e approach, with fewer egg yolks. He bakes the flan right into the cup for a creamy base. \u201cBack home you\u2019ll get a small square of flan in halo-halo,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I wanted to make sure everyone got a taste.\u201dThe UbeThe crowning touch is a scoop of roasted, pure\u0301ed ube\u2014a sweet, starchy potato. \u201cThis is everyone\u2019s favorite part,\u201d Boquila says, but he warns guests not to eat it straight off the top. \u201cYou have to stir it all together to make sure you get a little bit of everything in each bite.\u201dThe Add-Ins\u201cIn the Philippines, they\u2019ll throw anything in there\u2014 cereal, crispy rice, toasted coconut. Here we make almost everything in house,\u201d Boquila says. His mix includes sugar-macerated jackfruit and adzuki beans poached in brown sugar, star anise, and cardamom. The only store- bought ingredients are coconut jelly and palm nuts.Explore Bon App\u00e9titDessertDish DecodedRestaurantsPhiladelphiaRead MorecultureI Instagram-Stalked This Croissant, So I Found Out How It\u2019s MadeBy Rachel KartenrestaurantsTurkey Tails Are The Most Delicious Thing You Didn\u2019t Even Know You Could EatBy Elyse InaminerestaurantsThe 5 Elements of a Flawless HighballBy Elyse Inamine and Robert SimonsoncultureThis Dive Bar Is Turning Out the Best Burger in OaklandBy Julia KramerRecipes you want to make.
