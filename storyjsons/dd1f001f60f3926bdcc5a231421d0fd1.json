You took a picture of them when they first went into the skillet, but it\u2019s still hard to say just how much they\u2019ve grown. You could take a chance\u2014or you could do the poke test.The poke test, which is just what it sounds like, is an easy way to tell whether a shaped dough is ready for the oven, and it goes like this: Lightly oil or flour a finger or knuckle, then give the dough a gentle but assertive poke, as if you\u2019re trying to get its attention. If the dough springs back right away (it\u2019s saying, \u201cHey, why\u2019d you do that!\u201d), let it rise for a few more minutes. If the dough springs back slowly, like it\u2019s waking up from a long nap, and your prod leaves a small indentation, it\u2019s ready to go.Why does this work? You want to put your dough into the oven when the yeast has expanded as much as it can (it will have one final \u201cfeeding frenzy\u201d once it hits the oven\u2019s heat, at which point your dough will expand even more). When the dough springs back quickly, it\u2019s an indication that the yeast is still producing gases and has not yet reached its limit\u2014the air bubbles in the dough (which are trapped in the network of gluten) refill fast. But when the dough springs back in slo-mo, it\u2019s a sign that gas production has slowed\u2014you\u2019ve pushed the air out of those bubbles with your finger and it\u2019s not being replenished at high speed. Time for the last hoorah!And yes, it\u2019s better to poke early than late. If the dough doesn\u2019t spring back at all, you\u2019ve likely over-proofed the dough. When the dough rises too much before it gets baked, it will collapse, rather than rise, in the oven\u2019s heat, and the crumb will be uneven and ragged.The time it takes for your dough to rise will vary based on the temperature of your kitchen and the temperature of your dough\u2014and the alignment of the stars in the sky. So while recipes can offer ranges\u2014an hour to four, let\u2019s say\u2014the poke test is a better way to judge readiness and to get your know your dough, whether it's for buttery pull-apart rolls, doughnuts, or conchas, on a closer level.Poke, poke:Cinnamon-Date Sticky BunsThese fluffy buttermilk-laced buns are filled with a cinnamon-scented date pur\u00e9e to capture all that gooey sticky bun glory without being overly sweet.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasically BakingRecipes you want to make.
