Have a question? Email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.Can I remove individual items from a pack, like one can of beer or a single pudding cup...? \u2014Lives-Alone LennyFirst you should know that it often costs more per unit when you do this. But stores have different policies, so ask before you crack into a sixer of Kozy Shack. And what\u2019s the worst that would happen if you got the whole case? You\u2019ll make some friends, Lenny. Make some friends.What do I do with a piece of produce I dropped on the floor? \u2014Butterfingers BobbiPut it back in the pile or add it to your basket. If it\u2019s a more delicate item, like an avocado, take it to the customer service counter or hand it to the nearest store employee. Too embarrassed? Buy it and bury it in the backyard and hope an avocado tree grows as a reminder of your flaws. Or, I dunno, eat it???Illustration by Cari Vander YachtWhat\u2019s your stance on sampling grapes or little snickety snacks from the bulk bins, etc.?\u2014Quality-Control QuincyYou can have ONE grape. Not a whole cluster. I\u2019m looking at you, Andy Baraghani! I don\u2019t care if you just came from the gym and are bulking up! On grapes! If you want to try something, ask. Did you know that at a lot of major grocers, a manager will let you sample ANYTHING your heart desires? Yes, even off-brand graham crackers. But do you really need to sample a roasted almond? Come on now.Can I bring 11 items to the 10 items or less aisle? Who\u2019s really counting? \u2014Mathematical MitziI\u2019m not counting; GOD IS COUNTING. This is the honor system, do you have any? I don\u2019t think 11 is a big deal; 14 is too far; 23 is outrageous. This is the only order we have left\u2014don\u2019t let it disintegrate into lawless chaos like Twitter and Congress.Illustration by Cari Vander YachtIs it ever okay to ride on the carts like a race car? \u2014Whee! WesleyIf the aisle/parking lot is clear, YES. There are more dangerous things a person can do with a grocery cart. Once when I was a kid, I was riding in the cart while my brother pushed me as fast as possible through the outdoor garden section at the Walmart Supercenter and I stood up and yelled, \u201cSTOP!\u201d and he did. I flew forward, landing on my head on the concrete. And look how I turned out!Please address the best way to abandon items you realize you don\u2019t want/need, especially perishable ones. \u2014Discarded D'AngeloThe road to hell is littered with vacuum-packed chicken breasts stuffed into magazine racks (a real thing I\u2019ve witnessed). You know someone has to deal with that, don\u2019t you? There\u2019s no grocery store detritus fairy who taps it with her wand and makes it disappear. However, since 17 people asked this question, it\u2019s clear we can\u2019t stop leaving the unwanteds in our wake. Who has the time or energy to trek through an exceptionally air-conditioned labyrinth to return that wrong-flavored yogurt? You do. Return it! Or fine, hand it to the cashier and apologize.Illustration by Cari Vander YachtIt\u2019s normal to take an empty bag of chips or an opened bottle of Dr Pepper to the checkout line, right? I\u2019m going to pay for it; I\u2019m just hungry. \u2014Famished FelixThis was divisive. I\u2019m strongly against it, but my editors are strongly for it. Plus, a Trader Joe\u2019s employee told me there was no store policy against breaking open a bag of Elote Corn Chips, so it\u2019s not illegal or anything. But please pay for what you snack on, and don\u2019t leave crumbs all over the conveyor belt.If no one\u2019s around to help, can you climb the lower shelves to reach an item on the top shelf? \u2014Short ShelbyDo you want to die under a fallen shelf of canned queso? (Kind of.) Go find someone to help! It\u2019ll only take a second.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIs It Ever OkayEtiquetteRead MorecultureIs It Ever Okay...to Fake an Engagement for Free Dessert?By Alex BeggscultureIs It Ever Okay\u2026to Bring a Plus-One to the Office Holiday Party?By Alex BeggscultureIs It Ever Okay...To Reject a Relative\u2019s Offer to Cook Something?By Alex BeggscultureIs It Ever Okay\u2026to Ask the Restaurant to Turn Down the Music?By Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
