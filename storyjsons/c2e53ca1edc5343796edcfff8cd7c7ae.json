Persian stews) are the backbone of Persian cuisine. Ghormeh sabzi is one of the most popular stews. Omani limes and fenugreek leaves (we like this brand) give the dish its distinct aroma. It\u2019s typically served with radishes, raw onion, and more fresh herbs on the side, as well as chelow\u2014steamed saffron rice\u2014or a flatbread like lavash. Omani limes are boiled in a salt brine, then dried in the sun. The darker they become, the funkier and tangier they get. Simmering coaxes out the celery-like flavor of the fenugreek and the astringent pop of the dried limes. \u201cIt\u2019s unlike any other stew, which is why I love it,\u201d says Andy Baraghani.Ingredients4 servings1\u00bdlb. boneless lamb shoulder or beef chuck roast, cut into 2\" pieces, patted dryKosher salt6Tbsp. vegetable oil, divided2medium onions, finely chopped\u00bdcup dried kidney beans, soaked overnight, drained, or one 15-oz. can kidney beans, rinsed5whole omani limes (dried Persian \tlimes), pierced once with a knife\u00bdtsp. ground turmeric4large bunches parsley (about 1 lb.), tough stems trimmed1bunch cilantro, tough stems trimmed1bunch garlic chives or 2 bunches scallions, green parts only, very thinly sliced1Tbsp. dried fenugreek leavesSteamed basmati rice (for serving)PreparationStep 1Season lamb all over with salt and let sit 20 minutes. Pat meat dry. Heat 3 Tbsp. oil in a large heavy pot over medium-high. Working in batches, cook meat, turning every 2 minutes or so, until browned all over, 10\u201315 minutes per batch. Using a slotted spoon, transfer meat to a plate.Step 2Add onions to pot, tossing to coat. Cook, stirring often, until golden brown, 8\u201310 minutes. Return meat to pot; add dried beans (if using canned beans, stir in during last 10 minutes of cooking), omani limes, and turmeric. Cook, stirring, until turmeric is fragrant and coats everything, about 1 minute. Pour in 5 cups water; bring to a boil over medium-high. Reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, 1 hour.Step 3Meanwhile, working in batches, starting at stem end, finely slice stems and leaves of parsley and cilantro, making even passes with your sharpest knife as you work your way up through the leaves. Make a few more passes over the pile of chopped herbs with your knife until each batch is very finely chopped. (You should have about 5 cups.)Step 4Heat remaining 3 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet or another large pot over medium. Add herbs and garlic chives; cook, stirring often, until bright green and slightly wilted, 8\u201310 minutes. Season lightly with salt; add fenugreek, crushing it with your fingers to release oils. Cook, stirring, until herbs darken and are mostly dried out, 8\u201310 minutes more.Step 5When stew has cooked 1 hour, add herbs; season lightly with more salt. Partially cover; cook, stirring occasionally, until meat and beans are tender and stew is thickened, 2\u20132\u00bd hours. If stew thickens before meat and beans are tender, thin with \u00bd cup water and continue cooking.Step 6To serve, divide rice among shallow bowls and ladle stew over.Do ahead: Stew can be made 3 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill.How would you rate Ghormeh Sabzi?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (4)Back to TopTriangleJust like my grandma used to make!

This was AMAZING. The flavors are both delicate and complex and it reminded me a bit of Bhindi Masala. Worth the time and effort and pile of herbs required.Trillian AstraNashua NH3/3/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titStewSoups and StewsPersianMiddle EasternKidney BeanBeanVegetableLamb ShoulderLambMeatBeef ChuckBeefOne-Pot MealsEasyMainNut-FreeDairy-FreeGluten-FreeHealthyishBraiseDinnerRecipes you want to make.
