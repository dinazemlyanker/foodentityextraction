JordanFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.At Benchwarmers in Raleigh, NC, they take their bagels seriously. They use fresh-milled Red Turkey wheat and Einkorn. The dough goes through a three-day fermentation process. They bake everything in a 10,000-pound, ripping hot wood-fired oven. And then they stuff their No. 5 bagel sandwich with Lay\u2019s Kettle Cooked potato chips. Because, thankfully, they don\u2019t take themselves too seriously.The sandwich has a creamy smoked fish spread (done in-house, in that same wood-fired oven), trout roe, house-made pickles, and a handful of Lay\u2019s chips. The result is a study in the number of different textures you can physically fit between two pieces of chewy bagel: There\u2019s the creaminess of the fish spread, the crunch of the chip, the pop of the roe, plus the snap from the pickle. Together, it\u2019s chef\u2019s kiss.You can find this mix of seriousness and playfulness, high and low, all across the menu. It\u2019s there in the peanut butter, banana, and roasted mallow sandwich, and in the fried bologna, yellow mustard, and egg combo. Could they have made their own potato chips for the No. 5? Of course they could. But where\u2019s the fun in that?Go there: BenchwarmersExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsNorth CarolinaRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
