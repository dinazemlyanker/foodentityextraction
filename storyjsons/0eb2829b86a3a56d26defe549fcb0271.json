I scored the cut sides of the eggplant before mixing in the other ingredients, as suggested in BAs basically guide to eggplants - Highly recommended. The flavors of the fennel, garlic and lemon infused into the eggplant flesh. Served with microgreens.a.goekler7491Denton, TX10/1/2020Writing this review in the time of quarantine...all of the vegetables wouldn't have lasted another day neglected. Used Japanese eggplant (that's what we had) cut in half and then lengthwise into planks, threw in  halved on-the-vine tomatoes and a jalepeno. Accidentally added the lemon juice at the beginning but the dish is forgiving. Spread the garlic on some homemade naan with the veg on top.  The end result was meltingly satisfying. As another reviewer wrote, resist the temptation to take the eggplant out early. It wants every minute.AnonymousOR4/25/2020This was: Awesome! I made exactly as directed BUT I added a very large carrot cut in similar size to eggplant (used regular eggplant) and a couple of large jalape\u00f1os! OMG! Can\u2019t Wait to make this again (and again...).NY4/14/2020So good!!!!  I used white eggplant (cut lengthwise into quarters).  Took a little longer, ended up bumping up the heat to 375 towards the end, but either way, it was delicious!akampa1530033PA9/28/2019heck yes this was ASTONISHING. i was tempted to take the eggplant out two or three times since it looked done but i stayed the course & it was so worth it. caramelized & creamy. i loooove fairytale eggplant. also i used fresh marjoram instead of fennel - would've loved to use a lemon but didn't have one. next time!!smashcatCT8/8/2019This recipe has changed my life. I'm now going to slow roast all my vegetables in copious amounts of olive oil! The fennel and lemon combination was a flavor bomb. The fennel seeds get crunchy and slightly bitter and smell incredible! I also threw in green peppers with the eggplant, and they took to the flavors even better than the eggplant. I suggest slicing the eggplants thinner so they absorb more flavor and there's more of that light crisp exterior.ashima.chopra08088210/13/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titAmericanEggplantVegetableEasySideVeganVegetarianDairy-FreeNut-FreeGluten-FreeHealthyishRecipes you want to make.
