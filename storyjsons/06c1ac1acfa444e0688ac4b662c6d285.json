All covered in today's class...errr, salad.By Alex DelanySeptember 18, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Heidi's BridgeFacebookTwitterEmailIf you\u2019re the kind of person that thinks that eating salad for dinner is lame, then you clearly haven\u2019t made this steak salad recipe. This is a Dinner Salad. It will not leave you hungry or unfulfilled, wishing you had made different dinner decisions. It delivers on its promise. It is a meal. It has more than enough to offer.But like Walt Whitman and my eternal love for deli sandwiches, this recipe is not one-dimensional. It does more than silence the rumblings in your stomach. It contains multitudes.When you make this recipe for steak salad with shallot vinaigrette, you\u2019ll learn pretty much everything you need to know about making a vinaigrette, seasoning a salad, and searing a steak. This recipe is the foundation upon which you will build your Dinner Salad castle, assuming you are the type of person who enjoys the thought of having a castle. If not, a regular home is fine by me. Do what you want.Let\u2019s start with the steak, because when someone says \u201csteak salad,\u201d most people concentrate on the first word more than the last. Steak carries the reputation of being a fancy food, a red meat for special occasions, and while that can certainly be true, steak is actually a perfect, quick-cooking weeknight dinner food. There are no special techniques or pieces of cooking equipment, no long waiting periods or arduous prep steps. All you need is a cast iron pan, a steak, kosher salt, pepper, and olive oil. (Okay, a little butter and thyme in this case, too, but that's pretty NBD.)The steak technique is bare bones, concentrating on the stuff that\u2019s important to nail for a perfect piece of red meat. That means salting every side of the steak generously and letting it come to room temperature before you start to cook it. And it means rubbing the steak with just enough olive oil and placing it in a hot, dry cast iron pan instead of pouring oil into the pan. (This reduces the amount of smoke that ends up hanging around your kitchen.) It means basting the steak in brown butter and herbs, and letting it rest before slicing it. The result is a juicy, crispy, pink steak that looks and tastes as you\u2019ve ordered it at a restaurant.And just like you seasoned your steak, you\u2019re going to season everything in this salad. Have you ever been served a salad that just seemed...incomplete? The components were all there, and there was dressing drizzled over it. But it was just missing something? That something was probably salt. Every part of your salad should be seasoned with salt and pepper, and in this salad the tomatoes, cucumbers, avocado, and the lettuce all get seasoned separately throughout the process. This makes the vegetables (which all contain a lot of water) and the avocado (which contains a ton of fat) flavorful and balanced. Always be seasoning. That\u2019s the salad law.Big whisk, big reward.\nPhoto by Heidi's BridgeThen there\u2019s the vinaigrette. You should know how to make a vinaigrette. For the longest time, I did not. I used bottled salad dressing. That\u2019s what I grew up with, and if you use bottled salad dressing now, I won\u2019t judge. But I will say this: The day I decided to start making homemade dressing was one of the better days of my life. Making a vinaigrette is simple, and it will ultimately give you a more balanced sauce for your salad. The shallot vinaigrette we make for this steak salad recipe is a classic, using olive oil, red wine vinegar, dijon mustard, and chopped shallots. And the real takeaway is the art of emulsification. Once you make this dressing, you\u2019ll know that whisking olive oil into your dressing slowly and consistently is what makes a creamy, thick, homogeneous dressing. It\u2019s all about the finesse.So, yeah: whole lot of learning going on over here. I\u2019m not going to pretend like we aren\u2019t taking you to school with this steak salad recipe. But guess what! At the end of class you get to devour a steak with crunchy vegetables and creamy avocado. And you get to say that you nailed it all by yourself. And you'll feel prouder and more satisfied than you ever did with the report cards you brought home as a kid. And you'll have mastered a few kitchen skills that you'll use again and again and again\u2014which is more than anyone ever said about algebra.And here's where all that glorious information lies:Steak Salad with Shallot VinaigretteCrusty, juicy sliced steak + a fully-loaded salad = what we want to eat most nights of the week, TBH.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titSteakSaladTomatoSalad DressingBasicallyAvocadoVinaigretteRecipes you want to make.
