Andrea10/19/2021This was great. I followed the recipe as given and wow was it not only good, it was  great. If you skip this recipe then you are missing out on something that makes you lick you your lips after every bite. The next time I make this I will add more salt to the sauce.  I found the squash added a different texture to the dish along with a subtle sweetness that made going back to the chicken and sauce that more delicious. Rod BarbourNorth Carolina1/28/2021This is one of the most delicious and easiest dishes I have ever made and it is truly a one sheet pan dish. Even the kids liked it. I made the recipe exactly as written except I used extra tomatillos and garlic to make extra sauce as it sounded really good based on other reviewers. We did try the acorn squash but not a big fan of squash so next time I would try a different vegetable. I spanish made rice to go with this dish as an accompaniment. The sauce went great with that too.  Will be adding this recipe and  cooking technique to our weekly rotation and maybe just change the  vegetables and the rub/ marinade for the chicken every now and then. RDNew Jersey12/11/2020This was so good! The sauce is creamy with the perfect amount of acidity, and the chicken is delicious without being too spicy. I might add more chipotle next time, but it was great as is. Might try a different vegetable from squash, its not my favorite.AnonymousColumbia, SC11/12/2019OMG! This chicken is delicious! I hate eat chicken. Is not my favorite thing in world, but this is a delicious way to prepare it. I used some spinach mixed in the salsa verde and chicken tenders instead of chicken thighs. It was perfectly cooked and delicious. Everything was on point, and everyone\u2019s loved it!manducarioMexico City, MX6/11/2019This is easy and delicious! I couldn\u2019t find the adobo sauce that the recipe recommends, so I used a chipotle sauce I found in the Latin section of an Asian supermarket and it tasted great. Everything about this dish is perfect! Great meal to make for a family or large group of people (if you double the recipe). The sauce was the bomb and I could see it going well with many other dishes if there is leftover sauce. 100% recommend and will make again!TessPereiraWashington, DC6/6/2019So easy and delicious - I used sweet potatoes instead of squash and the salsa worked so well with it! Anonymous5/5/2019One of my go to weeknight recipes.  I add 1/2 tspn of coriander and pureed garlic to the chicken marinade, and I often times don't make this with acorn squash (not a vegetable I particularly love), but other than that, I follow this recipe to a T.  \n\nThe salsa is amazing, so tart and creamy like another reviewer stated. It's also extremely versatile. I've sauteed it with some beans and put it over rice for a light lunch.  It would be a good side dish to accompany this dish.AnonymousEvanston, IL12/3/2018I will NEVER understand how this sauce came out so creamy and tart. DELICIOUS. New staple recipe. Next time I'm going to swap out the squash for another vegetable. 8/29/2018This is really good. The only change I will make is in either getting a baking sheet with a rim all around it, or putting it in baking dishes. My baking sheets have a lip only on one side and there was a bit of a mess / smoke as the delicious juices poured off.AnonymousHershey6/10/2018Awesome recipe! The tomatillo sauce is beyond delicious. It would be great on eggs, a sandwich, veggies, protein... basically everything. AnonymousBrooklyn, NY4/16/2018This was absolutely delicious!  Easy to put together and loved by young and old. I\u2019ve never had acorn squash and loved it!Anonymous4/4/2018Good recipe. When I make it again...I will reinforce the seasoning to include ground cumin, black pepper and chipotle peppers directly on the chicken. Loved the acorn squash!TRP_4750San Francisco, Ca4/4/2018This was terrific!  Made it last  night and it\u2019s a keeper.  The chicken thighs I had were larger than normal so it took a little more time in the oven than the recipe but otherwise this was spot on.  The acorn squash was really tasty (even to those who don\u2019t normally like squash of any type) and the tomatillo sauce was dreamy.  The only thing I might do differently next time is double the adobe spice mixture on the chicken\u2014but this was deeee-licious!AnonymousBoston, MA3/29/2018I made this last night and it turned out amazing!  My husband and I loved it - it's a real comebacker.  Loved the salsa, the acorn squash and the chipotle/honey sauce on the chicken. Yummers!  I have leftover salsa and will be putting that to good use soon. Thanks for a great recipe!AnonymousPalm Harbor, FL3/24/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titChickenPoultryChicken ThighTomatilloVegetableAcorn SquashSquashSheet-Pan DinnersMainDairy-FreeNut-FreeGluten-FreeDinnerBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
