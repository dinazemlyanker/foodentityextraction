And we asked them to do it while filming Making Perfect, a six-part video series documenting every success and setback. Somehow, it all worked out...perfectly. Here\u2019s how the Fancy Cranberry Sauce came together.Find all of the recipes from the Absolutely, Positively Perfect Thanksgiving menu here.The Dream TeamAndy Baraghani and Brad LeoneThe ChallengeFor some inexplicable reason (let\u2019s blame DNA and nostalgia), the staff of Bon Appe\u0301tit has a thing for canned cranberry sauce. But they can\u2019t get behind the preservatives and all that corn syrup.The SolutionBrad and Andy dreamed of a sauce as sliceable and jiggly and fun as the canned stuff, but with deeper fruit flavor and more nuance. It\u2019s subtly spiced with bay leaves and cardamom, then set in a gelatin mold that your cousins will never see coming and crowned with sugary orange zest and cranberries. \u201cThis will be polarizing,\u201d says Andy. \u201cI\u2019m fine with it.\u201dWatch Andy and Brad on their quest to make the perfect Thanksgiving turkey and cranberry sauce.\nFace Off: Smooth vs. TexturedBrad prefers a smoother bite, so he tried a version that put the cranberry mixture through a food mill. But Andy wanted real fruit texture, so they left the cranberry mixture as is and doubled down with tiny cranberry galaxies floating in jelly. Brad wanted to use pectin to create a sort of \u201cset jam,\u201d Andy preferred a wobbly gelatin. Somehow Andy kept getting his way.Brad Stans Canned SauceHe grew up with the stuff, he can\u2019t help it. \u201cThere was something in that can that had a little grit to it,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like transparent Jell-O. It\u2019s murky and purple and beautiful.\u201dThe ingredients all laid out.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanThe Mold Never Gets Old...This is your once-yearly chance to dust off that gelatin mold you inherited from Great-Uncle Albert (he was into suspended fruit salads, so what?). But beware a mold that\u2019s very intricate\u2014too many little nooks and crannies and indentations will make it more difficult for the jelly to slide out. Lacking a Great-Uncle Albert? Sorry to hear it. The best molds are vintage, so peruse Etsyuntil you find the shape of your dreams. Yes, French ice cream moldswill also work\u2014thanks for asking. And before pouring in your cranberry mixture, don\u2019t forget to coat the tin with nonstick spray....But You Can Bundt If You WannaFor aesthetic and historically accurate (and clearly personal) reasons, Andy insisted on using an old-school mold, which doesn\u2019t have a hole in the center and thus makes bigger, more dramatic slices. But a Bundt pan also makes a totally fantastic gelatin mold! If you\u2019re bundting, we like the nonstick Anniversary Bundt pan from Nordic Ware.Buy it: Anniversary Bundt pan from Nordic Ware, $38 at Williams SonomaHow to Serve ItOn your finest vintage china, cutting each serving into a thin wedge as you would cake.Get the recipe:Fancy Cranberry SauceWe have a thing for canned cranberry sauce, so we dreamed up a sauce as sliceable and jiggly and fun, with deep fruit flavor and a pretty topping.View RecipeFor more Absolutely, Positively Perfect Thanksgiving menu ideas:1 / 8ChevronChevronExpertly Spiced and Glazed Roast TurkeyView RecipeAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
