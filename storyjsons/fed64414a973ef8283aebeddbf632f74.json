Pur\u00e9eing some of the mushrooms along with cashews adds body that doesn\u2019t compromise on flavor.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Haven\u2019t made this yet and haven\u2019t found miso yet either. AnonymousHouston2/24/2022Along with some of the very helpful tips, I tweaked with truffle oil, truffle salt, and topped with fried shallots. \nBeth C. Los Angeles2/23/2022This recipe is fantastic! I did add 1/2 a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar after combining the blended portion with what was in the pot. I felt like it needed something but other than that, this was a huge hit! Grace H.Savannah, GA2/22/2022This recipe is amazing! I too subbed half the water with vegetable broth, and used a little less liquid than called for. Other than that, followed recipe exactly and it is easy to execute while tasting quite sophisticated. Served with a kale caesar salad and would have been delicious with some crusty sourdough bread.  Thank you BA for this stroke of genius.KristinaWoodside, CA2/3/2022This was AMAZING! My whole family enjoyed it. I made it two days in a row! I used vegetable broth instead of water. Cobi LemkeLong Beach, California 1/26/2022This soup is delicious! The cashews make it very creamy,  you do not miss dairy at all. I have made this twice,  both times used stock (chicken or veggie) \ninstead of water which I think is key to adding flavor.    The garlic oil is also very good.  I spooned it without the garlic and it's still flavorful.  Highly recommend it. AnonymousDenver 1/26/2022Absolutely delicious!  It was so good, I forgot to make the garlicky oil.  I will be making it again immediately.Em BeeNova Scotia1/9/2022It\u2019s great, although mushrooms should be salted. Anonymous12/13/2021It is indeed well worth the time to truly brown the mushrooms. Though I am nowhere close to being vegan this is certainly one of my favorite winter soups.KathleenNew Mexico, USA11/12/2021This is soooo divine! Thank you! I was a bit worried when I noticed the recipe didn\u2019t call for bouillon (and I didn\u2019t have any on hand), but it doesn\u2019t need it. \nOne question: do you add the garlic in the garlic oil to the soup? I strained it, and it certainly doesn\u2019t lack in flavour!Sam10/31/2021agree with other reviewers in that ,as is, the recipe lacks a flavor punch.... next time I make it I'll use veggie stock and take more time to carefully individually brown the mushrooms the medley. AnonymousDC10/21/2021Loved this so much! I didn\u2019t have shallots, and used cooking wine instead of regular wine. Cashews made it so deliciously creamy. What a treat to have a nice rich cream of mush soup as a vegan!AnonymousOntario10/4/2021Wow did my variation of this soup come out delicious. I had a hard time browning my mushrooms so they looked ugly and I didn\u2019t have wine so I deviated a bit from the directions. I also used more mushrooms than called for with shiitake as the primary type. I used vegetable stock rather than water and added miso for flavor since I was missing the wine. I also blended almost all the mushrooms, onions, and scallions - stirring them back into the leftover broth. Last I stirred in cashew cream left over from my other recipes instead of using the cashews called out in the recipe and blending it. This was one of the very best soups I have ever had and it was vegan. From taste to texture it was as good as I would get in the most upscale restaurant. It had an earthy and rich taste while preserving a light not dense taste and feel, and it had a velvety texture. Incredible! Paris Eden Los Angeles, California 9/17/2021So tasty! Especially on the second day. I needed soem bread for it to make a full dinner and for scraping out the bowl (wouldn't want any of that shroomy deliciousness go to waste), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and was rewarded <3 thank you ChrisLeaGermany9/8/2021\n good!! I used Better than Bouillon mushroom stock and a mix of cremini, white button and portobello mushrooms. I\u2019m not super familiar with miso and have not loved miso soup in the past but I added it and I only have good things to report. My craving for mushroom soup has been deliciously satisfied and I\u2019m definitely keeping this recipe for future rotation.
