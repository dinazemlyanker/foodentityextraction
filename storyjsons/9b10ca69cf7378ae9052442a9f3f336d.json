It makes me feel like I\u2019m on vacation in Mexico City and everything is sunny and good enough in the world.The hibiscus flowers brew into a rich inky magenta tea that makes all other iced tea seem watery and weak. Hibiscus has a very tart (but not as tart as cranberry) and juicy flavor that gets rounded out with sugar and woken up with lime juice. You might know hibiscus tea as sorrel, carcad\u00e8, or many other names\u2014there are versions of the tea found around the globe. I\u2019m most familiar with the Mexican agua fresca, which my dad used to make during hot Houston, well, all-the-times.So I bought ONE GIANT POUND of dried hibiscus on Amazon to make it myself. In my isolated life, it\u2019s become my negroni substitute when I\u2019m trying to turn things down a notch (yippee). Dr. Google tells me hibiscus is positively PACKED with antioxidants, which makes me a health goddess. Come take a tour of my liver, it\u2019s sparkling!This vintage, slightly extra Andy Baraghani recipe is my jumping off point for my agua de jamaica, but I omit a few ingredients (Thai chile, I\u2019m not stocking those at the moment) and cut the sugar in half. I\u2019ve also made the recipe in Gabriela C\u00e1mara\u2019s My Mexico City cookbook, which is super straightforward and classic (good cookbook alert). The tea steeps for 30 minutes or so, then I strain it and store in the fridge labeled \u201cHIBISCUS CONCENTRATE\u201d so I remember to dilute it with equal parts water: tea. Andy\u2019s addition of vanilla gives it a slight creamy note, and with seltzer, it reminds me of Big Red cream soda (Texans know). I\u2019ve played with different citrus zests, cinnamon sticks, and a jalape\u00f1o if the mood feels spicy. Hard to go wrong.My one-pound bag of dried flowers barely has a dent in it, all these months later. (Time to make some rhubarb jam\u2026) What a worthy investment! I have yet to accidentally tie-dye any white clothing, too. I really don\u2019t see any downside here.Buy It: Frontier Co-op Hibiscus Flowers, $20 for one-pound bag on AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
