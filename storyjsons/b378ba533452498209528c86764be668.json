It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.The only good zucchini recipe in the entire worldZucchini is like the glass of water that\u2019s been sitting on your bedside table while you were away all weekend during a heatwave, and you know your cats have been drinking out of it.Zucchini is like your husband\u2019s gym socks. Even when they\u2019re clean, you\u2019d rather not touch them.Zucchini is a summer cold: Insulting.Zucchini is a wet bath mat.Zucchini is sand in your sandwich.Zucchini takes something that should be good\u2014fresh summer produce\u2014and makes it bad, just by, like, being itself.I am editing the first draft of my cookbook right now, and I just removed all mentions of zucchini. I don\u2019t want to be associated with it.To use the phrasing I\u2019ve taught my children to employ when they\u2019d rather stab themselves in the eyes than eat what I\u2019ve put on the table: Thank you for offering, but I don\u2019t care for zucchini.Am I being clear?Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Let\u2019s look at the facts. Zucchini is watery and bland. Its flesh tastes like nothingness, but the skin can be weirdly bitter. Sometimes they look good\u2014there are types that are striped or curved or come in pretty hues\u2014but they\u2019re all the same inside, which seems extra rude.Chris SearlZucchini grows like crazy, so there are tons of recipes for it, sort of like how common illnesses can be treated with a wide range of available medications.I\u2019ve tried to like it. If you prepare it raw and you eat it the second it\u2019s been sliced, it might be crunchy. For a hot minute I liked this shaved zucchini salad with macadamias, but I\u2019ve never made it at home because I don\u2019t trust anyone I live with to be quick enough, and five seconds later it turns into a watery mess.Some say zucchini is \u201cgreat\u201d if you dress it with lemon juice, excellent olive oil, shavings of Parmigiano, and flaky sea salt. I\u2019ve tried that, too, but I think it only works if you\u2019re sitting on a yacht off the coast of Capri, and do I look like Leonardo DiCaprio to you?Anyway, if I was in Italy, I\u2019d order stuffed zucchini flowers, because those are stuffed with mozzarella and anchovies, then battered and fried.Zach DeSartI\u2019ve also made a thousand zucchini fritters, trying to prove to myself that zucchini has some\u2014any?!\u2014redeeming qualities. But in order to make a decent fritter, you have to shred the flesh, salt it, squeeze it, toss it, and squeeze it out again, effectively obliterating everything zucchini-ish about the zucchini in the process. Even if you make a good fritter in the end, it\u2019s not a very strong case for zucchini.See? I\u2019ve tried. Zucchini is basically horrible and there are no exceptions.Okay, fine. This wouldn\u2019t be much of a newsletter if there wasn\u2019t one exception.Here it is. The only zucchini recipe I can get behind is one in which halved zucchini is thrown onto a grill, allowed to blacken and char, and then torn asunder and tossed with vinegary onions, hot Calabrian chiles, and cooling mint.It\u2019s extreme makeover: zucchini edition.Why is this one good and everything else is bad? Let\u2019s look at the facts: The cooking process undoes all the unappealing things zucchini always has to offer. The charring ekes out any inherent sweetness and cloaks it in a fierce smokey eye. The heat slightly dehydrates the flesh, throwing off some of all that excess water, and helps the flesh morph from watery planks into a custardy, pudding-like texture.Zucchini aside, it\u2019s the accompaniments that make the dish. Fiercely spicy Calabrian chiles, refreshing mint, pickled onions\u2014they\u2019d be good with anything. You could use the same base method with small eggplant or small scrubbed beets and it would be fantastic. Corn cobs still in their husks. Sweet bell peppers. Halloumi cheese.Heyyyyyy\u2026 wait a minute! This zucchini recipe doesn\u2019t even need to be made with zucchini! You could use zucchini, of course. And if you were extremely thirsty, you could drink that glass of cat water on your nightstand. It might not be great, but it probably won\u2019t kill you.
