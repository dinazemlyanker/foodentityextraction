He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Whenever my wife and I invite friends over, Simone almost always asks, \u201cCan we make risotto?\u201d And, almost always, my stock answer has been \u201cNo\u2014it\u2019s too much of a pain.\u201dWell, turns out, as with most disputes in the RapoBuck household, I was wrong. Yes, risotto does require your mostly undivided attention (a ladle of stock...stir, stir, stir...another ladle of stock...). But if you\u2019ve got a confident co-pilot, you can divide and conquer the cooking tasks and stir up creamy, tender risotto and the rest of your menu right on time.This past New Year\u2019s, our friend Caitlin showed up with a mess of beautiful wild mushrooms and riffed on Carla Music\u2019s no-fail mushroom risotto. Meanwhile, our friend Michael roasted a mustard-and-herb-coated rack of lamb. An indulgent, and absolutely perfect pairing.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!And then, a few nights ago, when we had our friends Krissy and Chloe over, Simone and I basically cut our stove top in half. With the left two burners, she heated chicken stock on one, while constructing a buttery, cheese-free lemon risotto on the other. Standing elbow to elbow, I pan roasted two, thick-cut Berkshire pork chops, basting them with butter and garlic and thyme, similar to what Molly does on Bon App\u2019s YouTube channel.Start to finish, we both had our respective dishes ready to go in about 20 minutes (the time it takes for the rice to release its creamy starchiness while retaining just a bit of bite.) I carved up the chops, Simone brought the risotto pot straight to table, and Chloe set out a big, green salad to cut through all that richness. Let\u2019s just say there were no leftovers.So, yes, from now on, as long as I have a partner at the stove, my stock answer to what we\u2019re making tonight is risotto.Get the recipes:Risotto With Mushrooms and ThymeThe path to perfect risotto is all about treating the rice right, but the added umami from torn mushrooms and thyme sure doesn\u2019t hurt.View Recipe\u00a0Cast-Iron Skillet Pork ChopsThough it may seem like a counterintuitive practice, extra flipping is the secret to the golden-brown crust on these pork chops.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterRisottoPork ChopRead MorecookingHere\u2019s What Makes BA\u2019s Best Risotto Recipe So Damn PerfectBy Alex DelanycookingThe Shrimpiest Shrimp Risotto That Ever ShrimpedBy Emma WartzmancookingWeeknight Dinner Party?
