My obsession is almost grotesque; I spend about 10 months out of the year yearning for the time when it\u2019s seasonally appropriate to gorge myself on mug after mug of frothy decadence. Whether scratch-made or store-bought, there\u2019s really no wrong way to indulge in the pleasures of this wintery delight\u2014especially when there\u2019s booze involved. Eggnog is endlessly adaptable on the alcohol front, and can be spiked with anything from brandy to sherry and even mezcal.The best spiked eggnog recipes often call for a mix of spirits, and my pursuit of dairy-rich punch perfection has led me to spending countless dollars over on nice bottles of brandy, whiskey, and rum, only to end up using half a cup of each. But this year, there\u2019s only one bottle on my \u2019nog \u201cnice list\u201d\u2014Hercules Mulligan Rum & Rye. Named after the now immortalized tailor and spy who fought alongside Alexander Hamilton in the American Revolutionary War, Hercules Mulligan Rum & Rye is a bespoke blend of three aged Caribbean rums, three American rye whiskeys, fresh ginger, and house-made bitters.Photo by Isa Zapata. \u00a0Food Styling by Cyd McDowell. \u00a0Prop Styling by Paige HicksHercules Mulligan Rum & Rye$38 at FlaviarInspired by how Mulligan (the man) was known to loosen the lips of British soldiers in his New York atelier with a few cups of the good stuff, spirits entrepreneur and lifelong history buff Steve Luttmann created Mulligan (the drink) based on a unique Revolutionary War\u2013era recipe. The result is a bright, playful, complex riff on an old-fashioned with layered notes of oak, honey, and warm spice. It\u2019s great on the rocks and plays well with others\u2014especially in cold weather concoctions like apple cider, hot toddies, and a delightfully fatty cinnamon- and nutmeg-forward eggnog.At just $38 a bottle, using the premixed blend in my spiked eggnog has allowed me to pocket the extra I would have spent buying both spirits separately. With a little extra cash to throw around, I can think about getting my loved ones a few more presents for the holidays. Though, gifting everyone their own bottle of Hercules Mulligan Rum & Rye just might be the way to go.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendShoppingCultureRecipes you want to make.
