This roasted salmon recipe certainly passed the test: one bowl, two sheet pans, big restaurant-worthy flavor and style. And I had just about everything in my pantry or freezer. (Big thanks to Sitka Salmon Shares, the amazing Alaskan CSF I belong to). Oh, and did I mention that this dish is really healthy, with lots of good fats and brain food in the salmon, vitamin A in the sweet potatoes, and digestive properties in the ginger? That certainly doesn't hurt.While the sweet potatoes took the full 40 minutes to soften and the salmon needed a smidge less than the recommended 16 (I used wild salmon, which is leaner than farmed and cooks faster), I had more than ample time to slice the veg and pear and whip up the tangy ponzu sauce, which I would happily pour on any protein or veg. I liked the of-the-moment presentation that breaking the potatoes and salmon with one\u2019s hands gave (though waiting for them to cool a smidge before tackling that task is highly recommended). The crunch of the celery in the salad seemed a little redundant alongside the crisp Asian pear for my taste, so I'll probably omit it next time\u2014or just snack on it whole while cooking. Mmmmm: fiber!Here\u2019s the pro move: I doubled this roasted salmon recipe and saved the rest for lunch the next day. The overnight soak in that addictive ponzu sauce made the salmon even more flavorful. (I stored the potatoes on top of the salmon so they didn\u2019t swim in fish-flavored juice.) Served over mustard greens dressed with the extra ponzu, it made for a very feel-good meal that kept me satisfied and energized until dinner. And as a person who is quite nearly always hungry, I really can\u2019t remember the last time that happened\u2026Get the recipe:Ponzu Roasted Salmon for TwoSalty-tart and just-sweet-enough ponzu sauce is a great back-pocket finisher for everything from salads to roasted vegetables, especially when you are tired of your everyday vinaigrette.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSalmonFeel Good Food PlanPotatoMustard GreensWeeknightDinnerRead MorecookingHow to Make a Week's Worth of Amazing Lunches in 2 HoursBy Chris MoroccoRecipes you want to make.
