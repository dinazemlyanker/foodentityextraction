Friends stocked it with homemade dumplings (two types!), lasagna portioned out into two servings for easy defrosting, packages of the best ramen, jam, tons of muffins and quick bread, and, maybe greatest of all, a bag of Roxana Jullapat\u2019s granola scones. (Upon receiving these presents, I climbed to the roof of our apartment building, my newborn strapped to my back, arched my chest toward the Heavens, and screamed, \u201cHOW DID I GET SO LUCKY?\u201d Mentally, at least.)But back to the scones. The adjective chock-full was invented, I believe, to be applied here: The scones are all goodies\u2014dates, coconut, seeds, nuts\u2014with only the strictly necessary fillers (there\u2019s basically \u00bc cup of flour in the entire recipe). Orange zest, something I never would have thought to add on my own, brings a brightness that counters the rich, chewy nutrients.Mother GrainsFind these scones and so much more in Roxana Jullapat\u2019s phenomenal cookbook, Mother Grains.\n$40 at Amazon$37 at BookshopThese scones are certainly more energy than fluff. In those first couple months, I would quite literally stumble out of bed with no concept of time of day or day of week, grab the bag of frozen scones, hack off a piece, and stuff it into my mouth before the baby would start crying. I repeated the process until all of the scones were gone. Eating a piece of scone somehow made me feel slightly more human than shoveling granola straight into my mouth, though the ingredients were not dissimilar. Not once was I patient or prepared enough to defrost, let alone warm up, a scone and not once was I worse for it\u2014they\u2019re good straight from the freezer.Someone in the comments called these scones \u201crough textured\u201d (but in a good way!). Bumpy is also a good descriptor, with each bite slightly different than the next. To achieve this panoply of texture and flavor, you need a lot of ingredients\u2014like currants and raisins and dates, coconut and flaxseed and pepitas and almonds. Rather than a breakfast you can throw together on a weekday morning, these scones are best made on a weekend afternoon (or when you wake up at 4 a.m. and can\u2019t go back to sleep) and doled out throughout the long, exhausting week. Make them for someone you love who\u2019s in need of an energy boost\u2014even if that person is your future self.*Also, one of the only gifts for me, not that dang baby. Jk jk jk.\u2026I Owe Everything to These Scones:Granola SconesScones full of the textures and flavors of a granola bar\u2014a hint of sweetness comes from copious dried fruit and a sprinkle of raw sugar.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
