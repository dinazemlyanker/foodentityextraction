But sometimes you get a watermelon that's a little paler than it should be and it tastes like well, not much. It's fiiiiine, but it's not the fruit you've been dreaming about since you emerged from your winter cocoon.That's when it's time to make a five-minute watermelon salad with lime dressing and peanuts. You stir fresh lime juice, fish sauce, and sugar together then pour it over some watermelon cubes. (The recipe also says to add hand-scrunched basil leaves to the dressing but I... didn't.) Toss salted peanuts and basil on top, then drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Done.The dressing punches up even the least flavorful watermelons\u2014the lime enhances the fruit's flavor and the fish sauce adds saltiness with a little funk (it's only one tablespoon, so it's not overbearing).Now for something very important I need to get off my chest: Can we all calm down a little about watermelon and feta salad? Why is it always a \"thing\" on mediocre restaurant menus? Too often, the feta turns soggy from the watermelon juice and everything becomes the same uniform texture of \"too mushy.\"I'll take this watermelon salad over that version any time: The peanuts offer a much more intense crunch, and instead of relying on feta for tanginess, the lime juice and fish sauce take center stage. I'm usually not one to take an anti-cheese stance, but this salad is an exception.Get the recipe:Watermelon with Lime Dressing and PeanutsThe jagged, irregular chunks of fruit in this salad recipe make it clear that something unexpected is about to happen.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titSaladSummerWatermelonRecipes you want to make.
