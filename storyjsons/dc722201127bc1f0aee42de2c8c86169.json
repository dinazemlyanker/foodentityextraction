When something\u2019s so easy you don't even need one. In It\u2019s That Simple, we\u2019ll talk you through the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed. Today, spicy ginger tea.For some people college was a nonstop party. For me it was a nonstop head cold. Between traveling for debate, living shoulder to shoulder in dorms, and pulling all-nighters in the library, my immune system was overworked and under-rested. That\u2019s before taking into account the crowded, dingy frat houses where reusing Solo cups was commonplace and \u201csocial distance\u201d meant \u201cclose enough for a guy to shout about his startup directly in your ear.\u201dSo I spent four years sniffling, sneezing, and blowing my nose, trying every cold remedy I could find for any morsel of relief. I downed bowl after bowl of chicken noodle soup, slathered myself in VapoRub, and burned out not one but two essential oil diffusers perfuming my dorm room with a constant flow of eucalyptus. But of all the remedies I tried during that time, the one I\u2019ve stuck with is my homemade spicy ginger tea.Spicy ginger tea is an amalgam of a few of my favorite cold remedies. There\u2019s honey and lemon to soothe scratchy throats, fresh ginger and turmeric for their anti-inflammatory properties, and most importantly, a hot chile pepper. The capsaicin from the chile, along with the acidity from the lemon and the steam of the hot beverage, works its way through the sinuses as you sip. Drink a full mug and your nose will run; you\u2019ll feel the heat behind your eyes; and shortly after, you\u2019ll feel your airways start to clear.Here\u2019s how to make my spicy ginger tea:Thinly slice a 2\"\u20133\" piece of ginger and a fresh hot pepper (jalape\u00f1o, Fresno, Thai chile, etc.). Add ginger and chile to a French press along with \u00bd lemon, thinly sliced, a dash of ground turmeric, and 1 tsp. honey. Fill the French press with boiling water, stir the ingredients to combine, then place the filter on top and press to submerge ingredients \u00bd\" under water (otherwise everything will float to the top). Once the tea is deeply colorful, press the filter all the way down and pour into mugs. Drink while the spicy ginger tea is still hot and steamy for maximum relief.Everyone\u2019s heat tolerance is different, so pick a pepper that\u2019s spicy to you, whether that\u2019s a jalape\u00f1o or a ghost chile, and remove the veins and seeds for even less heat. As for me, I like to use red Thai chiles, which pack a nice punch and pair incredibly well with the bright ginger flavor.Since graduating I\u2019ve stopped getting so many colds. Part of that\u2019s personal\u2014no more frat parties\u2014but it\u2019s also due to the ramifications of COVID. Still, even though I\u2019m nowhere near as sniffly as I was in the before times, I\u2019m still making spicy ginger tea as often. The ginger makes for a relaxing sip at the end of a long day, and the heat from the chiles is like a caffeine-free pick-me-up when the sun sets before 5 o\u2019clock. If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned since college, it\u2019s that you shouldn\u2019t wait until things are bad to take care of yourself. Also, that essay won\u2019t get better after 2 a.m. Just get some rest, bud.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimplecookingRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
