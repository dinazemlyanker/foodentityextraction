LOTS of prep. IMO, not worth the trouble.SharonDallas 3/1/2022The flavors were wonderful, however the pork chops were a little dry. I purchased high quality 1 1/2 inch bone in chops, braised them for 70 minutes as per the recipe, but they came out a little dry. I\u2019m wondering whether I cooked them too long or not long enough.
