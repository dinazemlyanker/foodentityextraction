Seek it out!By Alex BeggsJune 11, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie CraigFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.When you pull open the door of 220 Church Street, a nondescript office building in lower Manhattan, you blast the sidewalk with the scent of freshly baked bread. There are worse smells in this city.The not-so-secret Arcade Bakery inside sells some of the city\u2019s best carb products: ham and cheese sandwiches, and ham and cheese croissants. (Okay, plus a fantastic mushroom sandwich, chocolate croissant, and seeded baguette.) And according to me, they sell the city\u2019s actual best bread: the Quinoa Loaf. I\u2019ve lived here for 13 years! I can say that!There\u2019s a tangy, present taste of sourdough. Thick, nutty crust. Airy, bouncy crumb studded with quinoa and flaxseeds. It\u2019s deep and complex, it\u2019s substantial but not dense or dry, and I\u2019m pretty sure you can even call it healthy. It\u2019s wholesome without being preachy. There aren\u2019t bullshit dried fruits no one asked for in there. And it doesn\u2019t need much, some olive oil and salt. A thick layer of butter. It can go savory with mayo and sardines, some avocado if you\u2019re one of those, or it can go sweet, with labneh and jam.Compared to other breads it is interesting. But not in the \u201cit\u2019s...interesting\u201d way that means too weird to enjoy. It brings something to the conversation. If bread could talk, this bread would tell you about the time it saved a humpback whale while captaining a ship in Alaska, complete with whale songs. It might even comment on the latest Jane Mayer article in The New Yorker. What I\u2019m saying is that some bread is good, well-made and flavorful, but it\u2019s a little boring. Quinoa Loaf would never talk about the weather.I\u2019ve learned to call ahead to reserve a loaf. During the week, they only made five each day. (I KNOW. But economics, man. Sometimes demand doesn\u2019t meet supply and there\u2019s no room for waste in this tiny place.) It\u2019s a $7 loaf\u2014that\u2019s a luxury loaf! So I\u2019ve restricted myself to one QL a month. It tastes better this way. And when I walk out of the office building triumphant, I hold the door for a few extra seconds to let the bread perfume escape. This city needs all the help it can get.Go there: Arcade BakeryExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendNew YorkBreadRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
