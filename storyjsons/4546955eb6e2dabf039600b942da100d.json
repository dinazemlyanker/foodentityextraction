Arrange on a paper towel-lined baking sheet and let sit 15 minutes.Meanwhile, heat \u00bd-inch of oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot to 350\u00b0. Whisk eggs in a shallow bowl, place the flour in another shallow bowl, and the panko in another.Pat eggplant dry, pressing between the paper towels to remove excess moisture. Dredge eggplant in flour, tapping off excess. Dip in eggs; coat with panko, patting to adhere.Working in batches, carefully fry eggplant in oil, maintaining the temperature at or around 350, until the eggplant is tender and the crust is deep golden brown and crisp on all sides, about 7 minutes, turning halfway through. Transfer to a wire rack to cool, season immediately with salt and sprinkle with parmesan. Repeat with remaining eggplant.Preheat the oven to broil with a rack in the top third. Arrange the buns cut side up on a rimmed baking sheet. Broil until golden about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the top buns to plates.Spoon a tablespoon of Rao\u2019s Homemade Tomato Basil sauce over each bottom bun and stack one eggplant slice on top of the sauce. Spoon another tablespoon of sauce over each eggplant slice. Top with another eggplant slice and spoon another 2 tablespoons on top of each slice. Top with provolone cheese and broil until cheese is golden and bubbly, about 3 to 4 minutes.Top with basil and close the sandwich. Serve with extra warm tomato basil sauce.Recipe by Rao\u2019s Homemade\u00aeReviews SectionReviewsWrite a review\u2026This was great! Eggplant was crispy on the outside and tender in the middle.  We made our own tomato basil sauce instead of using jarred.  The sandwich was really tall with two slices of eggplant, so we ended up eating it with knife and fork.AnonymousJonesville, MI01/23/22Made this last night and we all loved it!  Burned the first batch of buns - 3-4 minutes under the broiler was way too long.  Everyone thought it could be a bit spicier-next time will use Rao's spicy tomato sauce.  But the eggplant was crispy outside and melty inside.  My daughter said she could eat these once a week!  Will definitely make again.AnonymousMinnesota06/22/21Wrong!  The first frying should be at 300\u00ba.  Then let the slices drain on paper towel and refry at 350\u00ba.  This is the same idea as double fried potatoes and raises the dish to amazing heights.  And you should mix in both Parmesan and Pecorino Romano cheeses in with the Panko.  Do this and you will have the eggplant sandwich of eggplant sandwiches.  Just follow these directions and you sandwich will be merely acceptable.  Be warned!Beside the Willamette.08/24/19GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for the Bon App\u00e9titNewsletterSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyExplore Bon App\u00e9titRao\u2019s Homemade\u00aeSponsoredMore from Bon App\u00e9titRecipes6 Pro Chefs Reveal Their \"Secret Weapon\" Ingredients2022-03-02T17:00:00.000ZrecipePorcini Gnocchi With Butter Sauce2022-03-15T09:00:00.000ZrecipeWhiskey Sour2020-12-16T18:20:00.000ZBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
