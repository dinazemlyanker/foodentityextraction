His first step in creating the menu ahead of the all-day restaurant\u2019s opening next week in New York City\u2019s West Village was to accept an ingredient he has a complicated relationship with. Porowski initially fought to keep avocados off the menu entirely because of the reputation he got on Queer Eye for his \u201cobsession\u201d with using them in every dish. Eventually, he caved, putting avocado on a citrus salad and a tartine topped with pickled beets for a crunchy, colorful nod to his Polish heritage. \u201cI hate the word \u2018brand,\u2019 but I have to have a conversation with myself and figure out why it\u2019s important to me,\u201d he explained of his recipe choices. \u201cI can\u2019t just have something made up and handed to me. I have to have pride in it, or I won\u2019t serve it.\u201dAlthough most of the menu was created by Porowski (who, full disclosure, I've known prior to this interview; we also taught a cheese class together at Murray's), the restaurant is a joint venture between him and friends-turned-business partners Lisle Richards and Eric Marx of The Metric restaurant group. They met in 2012, and then started keeping each other in check with a workout club two years ago, taking classes at Barry\u2019s Bootcamp, Tone House, and SoulCycle... and then immediately finding food that wouldn\u2019t undo all of the work they just did. They usually ended up at The Wayfarer, one of Richards and Marx\u2019s restaurants in Midtown Manhattan, for grilled salmon and vegetables to refuel. The routine inspired them to collaborate for what Porowski describes as a \u201chealth and wellness concept that was still delicious and flavorful, but not super precious or not too much of one thing.\u201d As soon as the original Village Den, a neighborhood standby diner for 36 years, closed in March 2018, the trio started workshopping ideas to respect the heritage of the space while modernizing it. Ultimately they kept the name and the original awning while revamping the menu.Porowski described the Sicilian C-bomb salad as \u201ckind of a crunchy, sweet, salty, spicy, everything salad.\u201d\nPhoto by Emma FishmanHe and the team spent three weeks testing recipes with Wayfarer chef Chris Shea, who helped \u201ctrim down my 35-ingredient ideas down to the seven most integral.\u201d Healthier meals inspired by TV dinners are the core of the restaurant, with a counter of mix and match options like macadamia nut-crusted mahi-mahi, turkey meatloaf, garlic-roasted broccolini, spaghetti squash (seasoned with Montreal steak spice and maple syrup, inspired by a childhood favorite dish), and a healthy twist on his Polish mother\u2019s famous cabbage rolls filled with ground chicken and cauliflower rice.There will also be fully assembled bowls (like citrus-poached salmon with smashed peas, purple potatoes, roasted broccolini, and kale crisps); salads (like the Sicilian C-bomb, a vitamin C-heavy dish with citrus, fennel, spinach, pomegranate, avocado, pistachio, and Tajin); breakfast items (like overnight oats and a chicken Scotch egg); and coffee and smoothies. The entire all-day menu is \u201caccidentally gluten-free,\u201d including scallion-almond pancakes with Green Goddess dip inspired by his sister Karolina, who has multiple sclerosis and introduced him to the functional medicine side of alternative flours. \u201cWhether people are keto, vegan, vegetarian, paleo, gluten-free, pescatarian, or have whatever dietary needs, I want them to be able to find something here.\u201dWho is this restaurant really for, though? Porowski is aware that the people checking it out initially will likely be fans of Queer Eye, but he hopes that will change over time. \u201cI want longevity. I don\u2019t listen to music that I won\u2019t like in a month. I fell in love with The Strokes when I was 20 and I\u2019m 34 now and still listen to them religiously. I want the restaurant to have [that same kind of] staying power.\u201d If all goes well, he has dreams of expanding throughout New York, with an \u201cevolved version that is a little different, but still keeps the mainstays we\u2019re known for.\u201dPorowski surrounded by plants that he will \u201cmake sure are always watered\u201d at Village Den.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanFans of the show trying to catch a glimpse at Porowski behind the counter will have to wait. Currently he is filming the third season of Queer Eye in Kansas City, Missouri, but he\u2019s been back and forth to check in on the restaurant\u2019s progress. The entire process of opening a restaurant has taught him that he can\u2019t do everything himself. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to want to be involved in every single part of the thing, because I feel incredibly vulnerable putting my food out there,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI still think it\u2019s weird that people are interested in what I like and what I represent.\u201dFor now, he\u2019s learning to let go. \u201cIt makes me nervous as hell to be away, because it has to be good. My biggest nightmare is that something doesn\u2019t have enough salt. If it doesn't, who are people going to come back to? Me. I can\u2019t be physically there every day ... but I can set recipes and flavors up. That\u2019s all I can do: make it something I believe in, and hope others believe in it, too.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titCelebritiesRestaurantsRead Moreculture\u2018Queer Eye\u2019 Star Antoni Porowski\u2019s 9 Tips for Dinner Party GreatnessBy Alyse WhitneyRecipes you want to make.
