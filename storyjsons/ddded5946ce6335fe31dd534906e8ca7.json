Have a question? Email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.I need to douse EVERYTHING my mom makes with Tapat\u00edo sauce. Is that rude? \u2014Picante PerryI bet she thinks you\u2019re defective (but in a cute way) for being so sauce-obsessed, a nice stalemate to be in. She shakes her head. You hit the sauce. Everybody carries on.How many times is too many times to reuse a cloth napkin? \u2014Rerun RandyThree. The first two uses are fine; the third is taking it too far. I don\u2019t care if you can\u2019t see any ranch dressing smudges\u2014bacteria abound!Am I allowed to start eating without everyone at the table? Some people choose to hit the bathroom just as the dinner bell rings. Dinner is getting cold. Where IS everyone? I\u2019m not waiting\u2026 \u2014Famished FaraUsually the first person with a plate full of food sitting down to eat\u2026didn\u2019t cook it. Ever notice that? And the person who did cook definitely saw you burning the roof of your mouth on the enchiladas before anyone else had a chance. Wait the four minutes! The food isn\u2019t going to get that cold.Illustrations by Cari Vander YachtI get that whoever didn\u2019t cook is on dish duty, but is there an argument for leniency for someone who has been laboring away at online school all day, compared to another family member who has been, let\u2019s say, playing video games? Or must both the workaholic and the gamer unite for dish duty? \u2014Educated EugeneYou wish! Give your weary blue-light-ruined eyeballs a break and scrub some pans with your sib. This is your chance to ask them about their life, vent about your parents, and you might get some pretty good gossip out of it. Who knows who they\u2019re gaming with? Could be a loooove interest.Can a family eat in front of the TV to drown out the sound of each other\u2019s chewing, which is very, very loud? \u2014Audible AureaYes, always. This is why Jeopardy! exists.But seriously, how do I tell a family member that they are eating too loudly? \u2014Again, it\u2019s AureaWhat is a loud chewer gonna do? It\u2019s their BODY. You need to work on coping mechanisms instead because life is full of loud chewers, jaw clickers, and people who hiss-exhale \u201css-aah\u201d after the first sip of water. Take a deep breath, make stimulating conversation, or, you know, crank the Jeopardy!Coming from a family of nine opinionated siblings, is it ever acceptable to talk over someone who is holding court at length? \u2014Second-in-line SueIn my experience the person already talking will just start talking louder and soon it\u2019s THUNDERING MADNESS. But as I think we both know, that\u2019s the only way in big families. Plus, it\u2019s kinda fun, and it drowns out the cacophony of chew noises too.Illustrations by Cari Vander YachtWho gets the last chicken cutlet? \u2014Metabolizing MateoIn order of availability:MOMThe middle childThe scrawny oneThe outnumbered stepsiblingMom\u2019s special friend, Carl, who\u2019ll buy us all root beer afterThe dogIllustrations By Cari Vander YachtWhen I met my boyfriend\u2019s parents for the first time over dinner, I reached for the bread across the table and his dad called me out on it. I didn\u2019t want to interrupt conversation! What should I have done? \u2014Reachy RamonaYou\u2019re not \u201csupposed to\u201d reach far across the table like a pauper, according to ancient rich people who were probably worried about their puffy sleeves catching fire. In this case it was ruder for Mr. So-and-So to publicly shame you. Look, you didn\u2019t hurt anybody! Unless you whacked someone in the nose with your elbow mid-reach, which you conveniently didn\u2019t mention here. You did a perfectly harmless thing. Next time ask when there\u2019s a moment of pause. Protect both sleeves and septums.Illustrations by Cari Vander YachtCan you yell at your kid if he pulls out his iPhone at the table to check TikTok? \u2014Peeved PapaUh-oh, are you talking about a TEEN? Good luck with that. Whether it\u2019s taking out a phone to check to see how many guys get killed in John Wick III (94!), tomorrow\u2019s weather, or share that video of baby Leah asking for \u201cmo\u2019 hot dog, mo\u2019 hot dog\u201d\u2014who isn\u2019t guilty of the phone check? And me of all three this week alone. If it bothers you so much, why not institute a no-phone-at-the-table policy where everyone drops their device in a serving platter? Done.
