It was attached to a bowling alley and arcade, and it\u2019s where everybody went to get quarters for video games. That, and our bulgogi cheesesteak sandwiches. My parents started making them because they had the ingredients and they were going to make bulgogi anyway. And then it became the most popular item on the menu.That sandwich was my first experience with fusion, and I\u2019ve been obsessed with the idea ever since. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t work. But I love an attempt. Blending different culinary signifiers, whether that\u2019s tortillas and kimchi or a burrito and Indian food, and putting them together in a way that turns them into something entirely new and exciting\u2014that\u2019s very American. It\u2019s the literal melting pot!Kogi all set up at its West L.A. location.\nPhoto by Ren FullerThat\u2019s what I thought about when I first tried the kalbi taco from Kogi, Roy Choi\u2019s Korean taco truck in Los Angeles. It was the early days for food trucks using social media to tell fans where it was going to be in the city. It was this new world where you had to track it down, and it became this very prized thing that everybody was after. I never even considered it a possibility.Then I tried the taco, and it was perfect. So luscious and really homey, but also very fresh and light. There were so many things happening: The familiarity of the iconic L.A. taco, the Korean tradition of wrapping food, the falling-apart short rib that almost tastes like barbacoa, the complementing sweetness of the corn tortilla. It made so much sense, on so many levels. I became obsessed with Roy Choi and all of his different restaurants after that first bite.The short rib (aka kalbi) taco from Kogi.\nPhoto by Ren FullerNow you can find Korean tacos everywhere. The success of the trend is really significant. It charts the immigrant experience: You come, you settle, you try to figure it out. First you can\u2019t get your own food everywhere. Then you can get it everywhere. It\u2019s no longer so foreign to Americans. And that\u2019s so great. Also, Koreans can be self-isolating, so it\u2019s a big deal for us to really assimilate. The tacos demonstrate how those old feelings Koreans brought with them to Los Angeles in the 1960s are fading, and a new spirit is coming in. It took us a couple of generations, but here we are.Korean tacos are more than just food. They\u2019re more than fusion. It\u2019s about having the freedom to take your culture and the cultures you\u2019re growing up around and blend them together. It\u2019s really about coming home to America.Margaret Cho is a Grammy- and Emmy-nominated actor, comedian, and singer-songwriter who lives in Los Angeles.Want More Stories From Taco Nation?
