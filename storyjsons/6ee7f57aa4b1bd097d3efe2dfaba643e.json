See our past recommendations here!When it comes to store-bought sauces, it takes a lot to impress me. Many spicy condiments blend into fiery sameness, and even the ones that don't hold back on heat often offer little flavor aside from burn. Yet occasionally, a condiment comes along that's like a black hole, compressing physics-defying amounts of flavor in a tiny package. Such is the case with Auria's Kitchen sambal sauces. I recommend beginning with the lime leaf sambal, which combines the mellow fire of green chili peppers with the sweet florality of makrut lime leaves. It is stellar as a marinade, the base for a stir-fry sauce, or just eaten as-is.Auria's hot chili sambal is a big leap up in terms of heat and flavor-density. The lip-numbing chili flavor is scorchingly hot, but shrimp paste creates an umami-rich intensity. (Auria swears by caramelizing the shrimp pastes, which mellows its intensity while keeping its depth.) Still, even to me, this sauce is HOT. But I can't stop eating it, and a spoonful dabbed on the side of a stir-fry or rice bowl is enough to flavor everything it touches on the plate. \u2014 Chris Morocco, senior food editorBuy it: Auria's Malaysian Kitchen Lime Leaf Sambal, $11.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
