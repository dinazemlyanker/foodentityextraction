But what are you supposed to do if you live alone and want a half-glass of wine? Enter the Coravin, which siphons out a portion of wine through a thin needle that you insert through the cork. Unlike a normal stopper, the Coravin fills that negative space with inert argon gas so the remaining wine doesn\u2019t oxidize.Coravin Wine Opener and Preserver$165 at AmazonFlexible Cutting Mats (Set of 8)Our workhorse cutting board is a Boos block (also on sale), but when you\u2019re handling raw meat, reach for one of these plastic mats.
