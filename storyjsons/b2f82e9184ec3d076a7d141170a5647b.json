Watching all of the primed and perfect foods on The Great British Baking Show didn\u2019t helped my waning motivation (as much as I\u2019d love to, I\u2019m not going to attempt Nadiya\u2019s levitating soda pop cheesecakes). But the ongoing indie documentary web series Home, A Queer Cooking Series has rekindled my love for the reality of simple home cooking.Each mini-doc focuses on one person or couple: queer artists, activists, and performers make dishes that either comfort them or mark a significant moment in their lives. In 8 minute segments, we cook vegetarian loaded sweet potatoes with an activist in Binghamton, NY, jammy soft-boiled eggs and thin strips of toast with a drag king in London, and watch cookbook authors and illustrators in Brooklyn flip raspberry pancakes and fluffy scrambled eggs. As they cook, they talk about their relationship to queerness. Open and honest conversations that feel even more intimate in the setting of their own kitchens.Creator Michael Chernak assembles characters you want to root for, encourage, and joke with over a glass of wine. \u201cThere was some sort of telling way about who they were through food, whether it was intentional or not,\u201d he says in a phone interview. \u201cI was having the most productive conversations with my friends and people I didn\u2019t know around politics, relationships, and love. Using food as a middle ground for the series helped bring all types of people together to listen to queer experiences.\u201dCourtesy of Michael Chernak\nDiving into this show feels fitting now, as LGBTQ+ people across the country celebrate Pride month, honoring the 1969 Stonewall Riots that sparked the gay liberation movement in America. But the show is different than a lot of popular queer media\u2019s usual suspects, like Queer Eye, a sharply produced show with Netflix\u2019s budget and marketing behind it. Home is filmed in humble kitchens with two-person maximum occupancies on a plain DSLR camera and mic. The dishes don\u2019t always come out looking like Instagram food porn, but they\u2019re made with the tenderness and attention that you give to meals you\u2019re making for those you love.This care shines in Jess, a bisexual activist, nurse, and single mother navigating life while trying to organize Ladyfest Binghamton, a festival in upstate New York that celebrates women, trans women, and nonbinary people, while trying to teach her young daughter how to challenge homophobia. \u201cWhat\u2019s difficult for me is everyday I see it in my daughter, these things that I\u2019ve never implemented in her,\u201d she says while broccoli, red pepper, corn, and peas simmer into a stuffing for sweet potatoes. \u201cI\u2019m trying to reverse that so she\u2019s more accepting and understanding of me. It\u2019s kind of a struggle, but it\u2019s also wonderful to do it by myself so we can pave our own way.\u201dCourtesy of Michael Chernak\nMoments like Jess\u2019s capture what works about the series. For all of its low-budget quirks (sometimes the coloring is off, some shots last longer than any moment of intense eye contact should), the series has an endearing warmth. It\u2019s soothing and meditative. There\u2019s no heartbreaking elimination, no underlying anxiety or dramatic turn. There\u2019s just the comfort of catching up with the friend you haven\u2019t seen in months. As you listen to Peter and Manny chat about the turkey chili recipe passed down from Peter\u2019s mother, the rough edges feel a little less brazen. For me, that\u2019s what Pride is about: honoring the recipes, people, and experiences that made us who we are, rough edges and all. This Pride Month\u2014and beyond\u2014my home cooking is another expression of that.Watch Jess\u2019s episode here:ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Explore Bon App\u00e9titPop CultureRead MoreInstant Pot Glazed and Grilled RibsRecipes you want to make.
