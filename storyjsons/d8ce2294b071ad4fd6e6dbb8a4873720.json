Gather a crew to help stuff and pinch them, then fry up enough for a crowd. If you can find head-on shrimp, buy them and add the heads to the stock. They\u2019ll add an intense shrimp flavor to the filling. Serve these empanadas alongside a picnic menu of beef sliders, grain salad with tomatoes, and Italian sundaes with Nutella.Ingredients8\u201312 servingsDough4oz. lard, melted, slightly cooled1Tbsp. kosher salt1Tbsp. red wine vinegar6cups all-purpose flour, plus more for surfaceFilling1lb. small shrimp, preferably head-on, peeled, deveined, shells and heads reserved4Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided\u2153cup dry white wine1medium onion, very finely chopped4garlic cloves, thinly sliced6Tbsp. chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces2Tbsp. finely chopped cilantro1tsp. finely grated lemon zest\u00bdtsp. crushed red pepper flakesKosher saltVegetable oil (for frying; about 8 cups)Special EquipmentSpecial Equipment: A 4\u00bd\"-diameter cookie cutter; a deep-fry thermometerPreparationDoughStep 1Mix warm lard, salt, vinegar, and 2 cups lukewarm water in a large bowl to combine. Gradually add 6 cups flour, mixing with a sturdy wooden spoon or your hands until a shaggy dough forms.Step 2Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and knead until mostly smooth and no dry spots remain, about 2 minutes. Wrap in plastic and chill at least 2 hours.Step 3Do Ahead: Dough can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled.Filling and AssemblyStep 4Cut shrimp in half lengthwise, then finely chop (it\u2019s okay if some pieces get pasty). Set aside.Step 5Heat 2 Tbsp. olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high. Add reserved shrimp shells and heads (if using) and cook, smashing down on shells and heads occasionally with a wooden spoon, until pink and bottom of pot begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Add wine and cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Add \u2154 cup water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until reduced by one-third, 6\u20138 minutes. Let cool. Strain stock through a fine-mesh sieve into a heatproof measuring glass, pressing on solids; discard solids.Step 6Wipe out pan, add remaining 2 Tbsp. olive oil, and set over medium heat. Cook onion, stirring often, until softened but without taking on any color, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add shrimp stock and reserved shrimp and cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the shrimp have turned pink, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. (Shrimp will continue cooking in the residual heat.) Mix in butter, cilantro, lemon zest, and red pepper flakes; season with salt. Let cool 20 minutes, then transfer to a medium bowl. Chill at least 1 hour before using.Step 7Divide dough into 6 equal pieces. Cover all but 1 piece with plastic wrap and chill. Roll out remaining piece of dough to a 14\" round about 1/16\" thick.Photo by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Andy Baraghani, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiStep 8Using cutter, punch out 6 rounds from dough.

Heat over medium-high until thermometer registers 350\u00b0. Working in batches and adjusting heat to maintain temperature, fry empanadas, turning often, until deep golden brown, 5\u20137 minutes per batch. Transfer to a wire rack set over paper towels; let cool 2 minutes before serving.Step 12Do Ahead: Filling can be made 1 day ahead.
