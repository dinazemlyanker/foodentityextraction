I ended up not serving it to my quarantine pod and instead just brought a bottle of wine.Anonymous9/26/2020It was great! I had no issues finding the ingredients, and I found there was just enough spice in the recipe. Make sure to taste your Garam Masala, since it can vary by brand.AnonymousColumbia, SC1/11/2020@Audrey Bock, or anyone who can't find an ingredient: Type into your search engine\nwhat can i use in place of pomegranate seeds\nand you'll get at least a few hits (some will be more useful than others).\nIn this case. a site called gourmetsleuth had some ideas (I didn't insert the link bc I don't know whether this site allows them). Good luck.D WUSA12/12/2019The recipe calls for too much garam masala. I think it should have been only 1 teaspoon as opposed to 1 tablespoon.AnonymousHouston, TX11/24/2019Calls for too much salt/garam masala.  Next time I'm gonna cut back on those two and beef up the cucumber dosage and I think its gonna be pretty good then.foodoUSA11/9/2018Easy to make, refreshing and a crowd pleaser. However, I couldn't find pomegranate seeds, had to go without - any recommendations on substitutions for next time?Audrey BockNYC7/4/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titDipCucumberVegetableShallotYogurtOther IngredientsEasyQuickStarterSnackNut-FreeBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
