And no, I\u2019m not talking about pasta water, or blanching water, or water for storing freshly cut crudit\u00e9s\u2014all of which I want to taste like the sea. I\u2019m talking about drinking water.Okay, okay, not always; I\u2019m not a monster. I consume my daily recommended ration of plain ol\u2019 unadulterated H\u2082O like a good boy. But when I\u2019m enjoying some Water Plus\u2014that is to say, seltzer over ice, or some tap with a healthy squoze of citrus, the kind of NA bevvie that is more about recreation than hydration\u2014I\u2019ll add a tiny pinch of Diamond Crystal. Even the most conservative dose works the same magic on a beverage that it does for solid food, making the whole thing taste more: more savory, more quaffable, more craveable. Each swallow leaves my mouth watering, wanting more. This weird quirk of mine also makes me an anomaly in the bubbly water wars. You can keep your La Croix or Topo Chico or Polar. If I\u2019m spending money on sparkling water, I want a cold liter of salty, salty Vichy Catalan.Let me tell you friends, this stuff is hot fire. Hailing from\u2014you guessed it!\u2014the Catalonia region of Spain, this wild-style mineral water contains, according to this water sommelier website that profiles boutique bottled water from around the world (LOL), a whopping 1 gram of sodium per liter. For context: The USDA recommends that adults consume no more than 2.3 grams of sodium per day. Y\u2019all, this water has about as much sodium in it as a MF\u2019ing Big Mac! It is the mineral water equivalent of an aggressive scrub down at a bathhouse or a deep tissue massage: punishing, purgative, purifying. And I cannot get enough.I remember my first taste of the stuff like it was yesterday. My dining companion and I decided to splash out for sparkling water at Frenchette, a tony modern French restaurant in Manhattan, and we were so engrossed in conversation that I didn\u2019t even notice our water glasses being filled from a frosty, elegant, stone-textured bottle. I took a big swig mid-sentence and gasped with pleasure. It was explosive, psychedelically refreshing, like a gripping glass of Gr\u00fcner cooled with rocks from a pebble beach. Sultry, saline, crispy-but-not-too-fizzy, I knew I had found the water that I would judge all others by, a water that truly got me.I fully understand if nothing I\u2019ve said about my beloved Vichy Catalan makes it sound appealing to you. Different strokes! But just saying: If you\u2019ve found yourself heeding any of BA\u2019s insistent salt-related advice and found it changed, say, your pasta or grilled meat game for the better, consider giving Vichy Catalan a shot. A person can have a little salty water. You know, as a treat.Vichy Catalan Sparkling Mineral Water$3 at InstacartExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendShoppingRead MorecultureI\u2019m Now a Leisure Soda Guy, Thanks to These Refreshing Leisure SodasBy Alex DelanyRecipes you want to make.
