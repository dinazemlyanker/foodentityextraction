There, prison officials used food\u2014the persistent coldness of it, the lack of nutrients in it, the sheer nastiness of it\u2014as a weapon of control. Fruits and vegetables were scarce, and meat was mysterious. \u201cIt was just air food,\u201d Huggins remembers. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t tell what it was because it was gray, no matter what.\u201d But the incarcerated women had no choice. \u201cYou ate it or starved.\"Eventually, Huggins and other women chose to starve. They staged a hunger strike on behalf of pregnant prisoners, who received no prenatal vitamins or additional nutrients. Embarrassed by the media attention, prison officials \u201cwere forced to improve the food,\u201d Huggins says, \u201cbut not by much.\u201dThe Black Panther Free Breakfast Program in action at St. Augustine's Church in Oakland.\nPhoto by Stephen ShamesNo wonder, then, that she was drawn to the Panthers\u2019 Free Breakfast Program when she was released, after her case ended in a mistrial and the trumped-up charges of murder and kidnapping were dropped. Launched in 1969 to feed under-resourced American children and combat hunger\u2014which the Panthers called \u201cone of the greatest forms of oppression\u201d\u2014the program was flourishing when Huggins moved back to Oakland, California. She soon became director of the Oakland Community School, which served home-cooked breakfast and lunch five days a week to hundreds of schoolchildren. \u201cIt was just so nice to see that the children were not going to the classroom hungry,\u201d Huggins recalls. They \u201cknew they were loved.\u201dThe Panthers secured food\u2014eggs, meat, bread, fresh fruit\u2014through donations from individuals, small stores, and local supermarkets, sometimes through threat of boycott. The free meals filled a critical need in the community. \u201cOur waiting list included unborn children,\u201d Huggins recalls.One day, she remembers, several boys lingered in the schoolyard, playing basketball as she locked up the school for the day. The boys told her that their parents worked multiple jobs and long hours, so no one\u2014and no food\u2014awaited them at home. Huggins went to the school\u2019s head cook, Melvin Dixon, with an idea:\u201cComrade, the children are always hungry,\u201d she started. Dixon cut her off. \u201cWe\u2019ll have dinner tomorrow,\u201d he said. From then on there were three meals a day.At its peak the nationwide Free Breakfast Program fed thousands of children daily, with at least 45 chapters in major cities from Los Angeles to Boston, and in rural communities throughout the South. It paved the way for the USDA\u2019s School Breakfast Program, permanently authorized in 1975.Fifty years later the Free Breakfast Program serves as an enduring model for numerous initiatives that address food insecurity, particularly in the wake of the pandemic\u2014programs such as D.C.\u2019s Bread for the City, FrontLine Farming in Colorado, Harlem Grown in New York, and the Interfaith Food Shuttle in North Carolina.More broadly, the Panthers laid the groundwork for such obvious descendants as the Black Lives Matter Movement and for current calls to defund the police. \u201cIf you think of it like the ebb and flow of the ocean, the Black Panther Party was a wave,\u201d Huggins says, \u201cthen the Black Lives Matter network is a wave.\u201dHuggins is 73 now and lives close to the site of the Oakland Community School, home to a program that helps formerly incarcerated men reenter society. She frequently runs into former students who thank her for feeding them so many years ago. \u201cThis used to be my school,\u201d one told her, \u201cand it was the best part of my life.\u201dRecipes you want to make.
