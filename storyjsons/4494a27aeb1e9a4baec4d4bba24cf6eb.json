I\u2019ve learned to substitute supple leaves for forgotten toilet paper, boil murky pond water when my enormous bottle inevitably runs dry, and concoct shoelaces out of fishing line.What I can\u2019t get down with is \u201chiking\u201d food; many a fiber-devoid day have I spent grazing mournfully on Slim Jims and watery cans of tuna. I\u2019ve tried packing grainy salads, loaded sandwiches, and hearty homemade trail mix, but the problem is that those need to be contained\u2014and containers come with their own set of problems. They\u2019re usually (a) made of plastic, which is notoriously unkind to Mama Nature (my host!), or (b) glass, which is both liable to shatter and heavier than I\u2019m interested in lugging about the wilderness. I assumed I was doomed to salty, processed purgatory\u2014that is, until I found this stainless-steel food box set from Klean Kanteen.Photo by Isa Zapata, Styling by Nicole LouieKlean Kanteen Lunch Box Set$60 at Klean Kanteen$60 at BackcountryMaybe you\u2019re thinking what I was: Oh, please, how much difference will a new container make? Turns out, a lot! These are both remarkably sturdy\u2014I stood atop the largest size like a ballerina in arabesque without leaving a dent\u2014and seriously light. According to my very unscientific scale (my\u2026two hands), the stainless steel was barely heavier than a plastic container of relative size. It\u2019s a burden I\u2019m happy to bear for the sake of greater durability, longevity, and sustainability (85% of stainless steel produced is recycled, compared to only 9% of plastics).Honestly, though, I\u2019d recommend switching to these containers even if you are an environmental nihilist, have enough abdominal strength to lug four mason jars of homemade tomato sauce up a mountainside, or are just looking for a new lunchbox. Klean Kanteen\u2019s boxes are built with your fridge in mind; they\u2019re perfectly stackable and symmetrical, like little food-filled Legos. Plus, imperative when jostling around in a backpack or your back-to-the-office bag (!), all three sizes come with leakproof, silicone-trimmed lids\u2014and both the 20- and 34-oz. containers feature secure, snap-lock tabs. (So secure that not a drop came out when I filled them with water and shook them about like maracas.)Regarding their (lack of) transparency, I do, on occasion, forget what I\u2019ve stored in them. Did I pack the fried rice or the farro salad today? But it never matters. In lunch as in hiking, the view is always that much better when you don\u2019t see it coming.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCampingSummerRecipes you want to make.
