If you want this in your inbox before it hits the site, sign up for our newsletter.Hey Basically readers,I spent most of last week feeling foggy and dazed, which I attributed, at the time, to the intersection of family stuff, work stuff, friend stuff, and the fact that the world...\u2014well, you know what\u2019s happening. Around Thursday, however, I realized that my mood wasn\u2019t only the result of general malaise: I had also been drinking coffee from cold brew packs I had received in a care package upwards of three years ago. I had no clue whether it was even caffeinated because all of the information on the label was in Japanese. Note to self: When your caffeine routine is working\u2014scratch that: when your caffeine routine is your biggest coping mechanism\u2014don\u2019t switch it up.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Even when I reverted to my old faithful coffee, I still felt sluggish and in need of distraction. Projects helped: I played sous chef, assisting my husband in shaping tortellini (if you\u2019re interested in making your own fresh pasta, read Alex Beggs\u2019s article, or watch Claire Saffitz\u2019s video), which we filled with mushrooms and ricotta; then I gave him a haircut! I made sourdough English muffins, then arancini, shaped as patties instead of spheres so that I could pan-fry rather than deep-fry, plus a spicy tomato sauce for dipping. I ordered the materials to knit my friend\u2019s imminent baby a tiny hat. (Did you know that this is how a pom-pom is made?!)My tortellini children.\nPhoto and Food Styling by Sarah JampelHere\u2019s what else I got up to:One Good TipMake Your Herbs LastOf all the perishable groceries, tender herbs like parsley and cilantro make the biggest difference in whether my food tastes drab or bright\u2014but they\u2019re also the first to get wilty and downright depressing. I find that they\u2019re most likely to stay fresh when I wash and dry them as soon as I bring them home. Then, per Amiel Stanek\u2019s suggestion, I park myself in front of a good show (for me, Sex Education) and get to sorting: I pluck out any slimy or discolored sprigs and toss the fluffy leaves and tender stems into a container lined with barely damp paper towels. (I let myself use paper towels and promise myself I\u2019ll atone later.) The thicker stems go into their own container, for future soups or green sauces. This way, whenever I\u2019m cooking, I can easily reach for a handful of herbs without having to worry about washing or trimming them. They\u2019re more likely to stay good and I\u2019m more likely to use them.Oh, but I don\u2019t mess with basil: That one dies the second it enters my apartment. I use it immediately.The \"set up.\"\nPhoto and Food Styling by Sarah JampelA Good Thing I Ate This WeekTuna Salad, But Make It ChickpeasI made a big pot of from-dry chickpeas last weekend, and they were still hanging around my fridge five days later. Good intentions, poor execution. So for lunch I made tuna-salad-goes-veg with inspiration from Aliza Abarbanel. I smashed the chickpeas so that most were about half their original size, then added leftover lemony shallot vinaigrette, a fat squeeze of the odd vegan mayo that\u2019s been haunting my fridge forever, and a ton of chopped chives and torn herbs. I ate it over bread with lettuce and avocado and felt like I was at a vegan lunch counter. Okay, it wasn\u2019t nearly as good as the fried risotto I\u2019d had the night before, but it did deliver on big flavor and small clean-up, and nutrition (I think).Is that you, chickpea?\nPhoto and Food Styling by Sarah JampelThis Week I\u2019m Going To\u2026Memorize a poem?Eat leftover dosa!
