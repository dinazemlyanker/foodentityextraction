Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,I\u2019ve felt a lot of ways in the last week, and every feeling\u2014whether it\u2019s sadness, fear, worry, gratitude, or love\u2014has been intense. I\u2019ve had anxiety so high that my throat constricts (not a helpful feeling during a respiratory pandemic). I\u2019ve felt complete, irrational joy at the sight of blossoms on a tree. I\u2019ve laughed uncontrollably at photos of my friend\u2019s cat. I don\u2019t even like cats.I was talking about this with a friend who is a parent, and she compared it to having a newborn. \u201cYou\u2019re living on the knife\u2019s edge of bliss and fear,\u201d she said, and I can\u2019t get that phrase out of my head.These days, my mornings start whenever my eyes bolt open, usually around 6 a.m., and I take my temperature while looking at my phone. I\u2019m not saying this is a good morning routine, but it\u2019s the way things are right now. I put on \u201cThe Daily,\u201d then I listen to this new podcast from The Atlantic, which makes me feel informed, terrified, or both, depending on the day.Recently the hosts of that podcast talked about how it\u2019s okay to acknowledge that terrible things and beautiful things are happening at the same time. \u201cPeople are dying and TV is good,\u201d as one of the hosts put it. I can watch the infection rates rise, and I can dance alone in my apartment to Robyn. I can know that my governor is using prison labor to make hand sanitizer, and I can be calmed by his daily press briefings. I can let the internet swallow me with bad news, and I can be held up by strangers I\u2019ve connected with there. All of these things can be true.Here is a poem that made me cry in a good way.Here is a silly three-minute workout I did today.Here are some healthyish cookies that keep for weeks.Here is an incredibly soothing list of Good Food Things. (Tag yourself: I\u2019m \u201cthe tightest coils of curly fries.\u201d)Here is an app that\u2019s helping me, and a lot of other people, find calm.Here\u2019s a way to keep your butt clean that doesn\u2019t involve hoarding TP.And here is a list of pasta shapes to match your emotional state. Wishing I were Reginette (Translation: little queens) but feeling more Fregula (Translation: little fragments) these days.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish editorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletterCoronavirusessayRead MoreLifestyleWhat \u201cTogether\u201d Means When We\u2019re ApartBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
