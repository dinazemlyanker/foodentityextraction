It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.I have sweet potato regretThere\u2019s a saying in my family that my mom definitely invented called \u201cnot-shopper\u2019s regret.\u201d It\u2019s when when you see something in a store that you like and want\u2014say, the perfect shoe in your size\u2014but then, for whatever reason, don\u2019t buy. And then you regret it, and it becomes a torture and a torment. The lesson is that it is better to have shopped and returned than never to have shopped at all. Remember that.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Right now I am in the throes of \u201cnot-cooker\u2019s regret\u201d and it\u2019s because we didn\u2019t make these twice-cooked sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving. I know! I should just be grateful the bloating has gone down and happy that my socks aren\u2019t leaving deep elastic crease marks in my calves anymore. But no\u2014I\u2019m in deep sweet potato turmoil, and it\u2019s all my fault.Last year, my dear colleague Andy Baraghani was working on the recipe for these alt-sweet potatoes right around the time that my Thanksgiving planning was underway. Because I loved them and because I wanted to do something different, I put them on our menu.There are a million reasons why this dish could have scandalized several family members and had me banished from hosting for life. First of all, we already have a sweet potato dish we all love, a chipotle-spiked puree that my aunt makes, and no one in my family likes change. Secondly, the sweet spuds Andy was working on were baked, charred, and glazed with brown butter and honey before being served on top of an insanely garlicky puree called toum, which can cause fire-breathing in otherwise healthy adults. The whole situation is topped with nigella seeds, which look at first glance like black sesame seeds but taste a little bit like onion-pepper sprinkles. Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s wasn\u2019t a very predictable addition to our Thanksgiving menu, which is harder to exert influence over than a hysterical toddler during a tantrum. But: my house, my rules. They made their debut.Look at all the colors of sweet potatoes available to you.\nPhoto by Kristin TeigThe surprise was that everyone loved them. Like, love loved. My father, the stubbornest of us all, couldn\u2019t stop with these sweet potatoes. He said things like, \u201cOh we always have to have those,\u201d and \u201cEverything was great, but that sweet potato dish!\u201d I told Andy all about it.And then, what happens: A year goes by and everything that was good became meaningless and forgettable?? I guess so, because I didn\u2019t care enough to lobby for last year\u2019s breakout star, and now I can\u2019t stop thinking about the way the honey sticks to the charred surfaces, so that they\u2019re kind of chewy and creamy at the same time. I miss the way you can drag a forkful of fluffy potatoes through the toum to get a perfect sweet-hot-spicy bite. I have special regrets about the way the narrow end of the sweet potato gets extra roasty and brown and candy-ish in the oven. And basically I\u2019m just mad about everything. This is what it\u2019s like to have not-cooker\u2019s regret.And that is why, now that the holidays are over and I am in charge of my everyday eating menu, I\u2019m going to do what\u2019s right. I\u2019m going to cook these sweet potatoes tonight, and again this weekend, and another night next week, and for when people come over, and whenever the sweet potatoes are looking good at the market, and also for meal prep on Sunday, and any other time I please. I made a mistake this one time. All I can do is try to make it up to myself.Get the recipe:Twice-Cooked Sweet Potatoes with ToumExplore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterSweet PotatoRecipes you want to make.
