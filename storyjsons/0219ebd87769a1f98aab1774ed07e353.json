Sometimes it\u2019s because I care (Colin Kaepernick\u2013era 49ers), and sometimes it\u2019s for the ads (Clydesdales make me emotional)\u2014but always it\u2019s for the snacks. Dips are my favorite food group, sustained grazing is my preferred method of sustenance, and blue cheesy Buffalo wings? To me, you are perfect, just like Jerry Rice\u2019s performance in Super Bowl XXIII.But there\u2019s one thing my Super Bowl spreads have been missing, and that\u2019s a Bundt cake shaped like a neoclassical outdoor football arena that can seat 80,000. Until now. Nordic Ware\u2019s Stadium Bundt Pan is made of cast aluminum with a nonstick finish, and the cakes that emerge are the centerpieces you didn\u2019t know your snack boards needed. I used it to bake Yossy Arefi\u2019s Spiced Chocolate Pumpkin Cake. The recipe, which was developed for a loaf or 9-inch round pan, yielded a smidge less batter than I needed to fill the 9-cup Bundt pan\u2014sort of like Super Bowl XXXIV, when Tennessee Titan Kevin Dyson was tackled just short of the end zone\u2014but the cake was still a showstopper. Plate it on a bed of dried shredded coconut for a Lambeau Field vibe.But why stop at cake! I also baked a stadium-shaped savory olive bread and filled the center with vegan queso, because I am a monster. You could make a decorative ice ring and float it in a bowl filled with Gatorade punch. Or use it as a mold for Jell-o Waldorf Salad, as wobbly as Seahawk Jermaine Kearse\u2019s improbable catch in Super Bowl XLIX. My stadium Bundt pan provides the festive oomph my game day needs, and if I must be penalized for excessive celebration, so be it.Nordic Ware Stadium Bundt Pan$38 at Williams Sonoma$45 $33 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendSuper BowlRead MoreculturePam Baking Spray Is Sprayable Flour That Saves My BundtsBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
