The bins stay the same!But in the year 2021, against all odds, I eked out a little space (and disrupted my careful organization) for store-bought gnocchi, a product I hadn\u2019t consumed in decades. For years, I believed\u2014wrongfully!\u2014that because store-bought gnocchi paled in comparison to fresh gnocchi, it wasn\u2019t worth buying. Instead, I\u2019d save that fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth gnocchi experience for meals out or unstructured Saturdays when I had time to boil and rice potatoes before hand-shaping the dough into tens of tiny dumplings. (FWIW, ricotta gnocchi is much easier to manage.)This all changed when I learned from the brilliant recipe developer Ali Slagle that I was making a false comparison. Instead of judging store-bought dumplings against homemade ones, I should consider them a different ingredient entirely\u2014and cook them accordingly.When you boil store-bought gnocchi like you would fresh, they have a tendency to get waterlogged and gummy. But, as Ali taught me, when you cook them in the oven or on the stove, with a bit of oil to facilitate browning, they crisp on the outside and stay chewy and soft in the middle, sort of like pan-fried Korean rice cakes or yaki mochi.In this recipe for Crispy Sheet Pan Gnocchi, the gnocchi get golden-brown in a hot oven, and a couple pints of cherry tomatoes, which roast alongside, burst in the high heat to form a low-maintenance sauce that prevents the dish from being too dry. Shelf-stable gnocchi\u2014the kind you\u2019ll find vacuum-sealed in the pasta aisle\u2014work just as well as the boxes in the refrigerated section near the fresh noodles. The texture will vary slightly depending on the exact brand and style of gnocchi you use, but it\u2019s simple to adjust the cook-time accordingly.No matter what store-bought gnocchi you use, they\u2019re not feather-light or pillow-soft as the best potato gnocchi ought to be\u2014but, in the end, that\u2019s exactly the point.Sheet-Pan GnocchiThis gnocchi (Is it pasta? Is it a salad?) with a jammy cherry tomato sauce takes just 25 minutes and one pan.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9tittechniqueBasicallyRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
