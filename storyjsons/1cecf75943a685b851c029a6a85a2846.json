But do they work?By Annie DalyMarch 1, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsea KyleFacebookTwitterEmailI come from a big family of craft beer nerds. For us, time together is basically synonymous with IPAs, whether we\u2019re checking out new breweries or taking long walks on the beach with our \u201ccoffee cups\u201d in hand. We even call brews by their ABV count rather than their actual names. \u201cOof, had a bunch of 8s last night,\u201d my dad will text me after a particularly big night out. \u201cRough morning over here.\u201dFor better or for worse, this particular brand of post-IPA commiseration has become a staple in our lives. And that\u2019s why, when I first heard about \u201cwellness beers,\u201d sometimes referred to as \u201crecovery beers,\u201d I dismissed them as an oxymoron. Everyone knows that beer can\u2019t help you recover, I thought. Beer is something you need to recover from!Recovery beers, which are brewed with sea salts, electrolytes, and other ingredients to help you refuel, first gained popularity among the hardcore athlete set. It\u2019s no secret that endurance athletes have always looked forward to celebrating with a delicious beer at the finish line \u2014 but as craft beers have gotten stronger and stronger, many such athletes have found that the whole \u201cwill run for beer\u201d thing takes too big a toll on their tired bodies. That\u2019s why Caitlin Landesberg, the founder and CEO of Sufferfest Beer Company, one of the top wellness beer breweries on the scene, set out to create \u201cthe Gatorade of beers\u201d in 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s so ingrained in our community to finish a workout with a commemorative pint, so I thought, \u2018If I\u2019m going to have one at the end of the race, I may as well have one that\u2019s delicious and complements my needs as an athlete,\u2019\u201d she told me.Her intuition was right on point. Sufferfest now produces five kinds of wellness beer, all of which are free of gluten, and the newest of which\u2014the FKT (\u201cFastest Known Time\u201d) Pale Ale\u2014even has as much electrolyte-replenishing salt as a common sports drink.The brand has gathered a loyal following, including folks like professional skier Cody Townsend. \u201cI love Sufferfest because they have a microbrewery philosophy, yet they produce a lighter beer with recovery benefits, so you don\u2019t have to choose between a heady IPA or a Budweiser at the end of a long day on the slopes,\u201d he explains. \u201cSufferfest still amplifies the stoke from the day without going against what I was just in the mountains for.\u201dAnd Townsend is clearly not the only one paying attention: Sufferfest was recently acquired by Sierra Nevada.Other breweries are on the trend too. Boston-based Zelus Beer Company, launched in 2015, produces six different recovery beers in different styles, with names like Race Pace and Long Run; Harpoon Brewery just released a recovery beer called Rec League, and Avery Brewing Co. in Colorado sells a brew called Go Play IPA. And there may be many more recovery beers in our future. \u201cConventional craft beer sales have been pretty stagnant over the past couple years, which has forced distributors to modernize and think hard about today\u2019s consumer. We believe that functional beer is where craft beer is going,\u201d says Landesberg.Turns out, I\u2019m not mad about that. Rec League, which is my favorite of all of them, is only 3.8 ABV and is brewed with Mediterranean sea salt and chia seeds \u2014 but to me, it just tastes like a lighter IPA; I can\u2019t even pick up the salt undertones. And that\u2019s the thing: Although these beers are loaded with salt and electrolytes and other very un-beer-sounding ingredients (one Sufferfest beer is even brewed with bee pollen!), for the most part they just taste like beer. And while most of these breweries have strong ties to the athletic community, sponsoring local races and run clubs, there is also a developing fan base made up of people like me who simply want a delicious craft beer that won\u2019t get them tanked after, like, three sips.\u201cWhen we debuted Rec League back at a five-mile race we sponsored in May, there were definitely runners who appreciated having something that could help them replenish the things they lost in the run. But now, for other folks, the craft flavor is more than enough,\u201d confirms Chris Bonacci, Vice President of Marketing at Harpoon. Geoff Pedder, the founder of Zelus, has reached a similar conclusion: \u201cWe do really well in pizzerias like TGI Fridays and Pizzeria Uno,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe craft beer market has gone so high in alcohol that our lower ABV volume is a big selling point, regardless of the recovery aspect,\u201d he says.Sports nutritionists are still skeptical about using recovery beers as anything more than a drink to go with your pizza. But if you\u2019re going to toast after a race, going with a recovery beer as opposed to a regular one is certainly a better choice, says sports nutrition and fitness expert Edwina Clark, MS, RD, APD, CSSD.\u201cLow ABV beer with additional carbs and electrolytes is a better option than standard beer post-race, but it\u2019s not a replacement for real food, sports drinks, and water,\u201d she cautions. \u201cIt\u2019s true that beer contributes to post-workout carb needs, but the carb contribution is still fairly low. People generally need somewhere between 30 and 90 grams of carbs immediately after exercise, and recovery beers provide around 5 and 12 grams,\u201d she continues. And the benefits are often negated by the impact of alcohol anyway, Clark says\u2014so make sure you refuel and rehydrate first to mitigate the effect.Or, you know, you can just skip the marathoning and go straight to the surprisingly delicious, wellness-forward drinking part. That\u2019s what I did last night, and I\u2019ll be texting my dad today: \u201cHad a bunch of 3s yesterday.
