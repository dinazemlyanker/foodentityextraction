Trash. Doing the most for the holidays DURING the holidays isn\u2019t going to get you anything except a headache. This is doubly true when it comes to holiday desserts. Sure it sounds crazy, but here\u2019s a thought: Don\u2019t do it. Heaps of butter and sugar have been following your guests everywhere they\u2019ve gone this past month. Why not offer them something on their way out the door\u2014something rich and delicious they can enjoy on their own time? Why not Andy\u2019s new recipe for salted chocolate halva?The whole recipe for this sweet-savory dessert is basically a series of dumping things into other things: mixing tahini with salt and sesame seeds; then mixing that with a sugar-water concoction. And then dumping melted chocolate on top of that. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s effortless. To pull this off, you have to have some finesse, timing, and one very special tool. That said: Don\u2019t even try to do this without a candy thermometer. You know, that metal contraption that attaches to the sides of pots and saucepans and helps ensure that you never burn sugar (and other things) again? As much as we love them, most meat thermometers aren\u2019t built to accurately and consistently read the temperatures of liquids, and this is absolutely required to make this thing work.Here\u2019s where the finesse and timing come in, so listen up! After you\u2019ve prepared a pan, mixed your tahini-sesame-salt mixture, and brought your sugar water concoction to the perfect temperature, you have to immediately remove it from stove and gradually stream into the savory stuff, mixing constantly with a spatula. Continue to mix just until the halva comes together and starts to pull away from the sides of bowl. This will happen fast\u2014as in, in under a minute fast. So be careful not to overmix or it will become clumpy instead of flaky, and you want that layered, crystalized perfection. Then, working just as quick, dump that bad boy into the pan and let it cool for a bit. You\u2019ll start melting your chocolate, and when it\u2019s ready, pour it over your newly set halva (which you\u2019ve slid out of the pan by now), top with some edible flowers (you can find \u2018em at spots like Whole Foods), and high five yourself. After letting the chocolate set for 30 more minutes, you\u2019ll be ready cut and package your holiday halva.By the time your friends unwrap their party favor at home (however many days later), they\u2019ll be blown away\u2014and probably ready for dessert again.Get the recipe:Salted Chocolate HalvaSalt and bittersweet chocolate lend a savory, sophisticated edge to this typically saccharine-sweet dessert.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titSaltChocolateTahiniCandyRecipes you want to make.
