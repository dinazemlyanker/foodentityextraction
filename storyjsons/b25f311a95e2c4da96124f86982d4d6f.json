But flour? I assumed that a flour tortilla was a flour tortilla was a flour tortilla, the burrito\u2019s unremarkable casing of convenience. I never gave it much thought. That is, until Las Cuatro Milpas changed everything for me.For three generations, the Estudillo family has been serving a distinctly So-Cal brand of Mexican food in San Diego\u2019s Barrio Logan neighborhood. Their menu is short\u2014nothing but the California border classics (rolled tacos served under a riot of shredded iceberg and cotija, crispy tacos stuffed with juicy shredded pork, steamy, custardy tamales)\u2014and there\u2019s almost always a line down the block to get in. Everything there is amazing, but the star of the show is the house-made flour tortilla, which serves as the wrapper for stripped-down pork-and-cheese burritos, or the vehicle of choice for a bowl of beans and rice or huevos con chorizo. Unlike the pallid, shock-white, \u201cfat-free\u201d flour tortillas I was familiar with, these were almost unfathomably rich, so full of lard that they looked almost damp when fully cooked, patches of near-translucence freckled with spots of char from the griddle. They had flavor for days\u2014toasty, nutty, and almost overwhelmingly meaty and porcine, like pork rinds in flatbread form.I kept eating long after I was almost-sick full, nibbling last little shred after last little shred of lardy goodness as I marveled at the brigade of women rolling out fresh stacks in the back of the restaurant. In my dizzy, overstuffed state, I swore I could see halos around their heads, the air thick with flour and fluorescent light.Sitting at that table, hands so covered in pork fat that I felt like I had just moisturized, I had the sudden, unsettling realization that I\u2019d been red pilled. I\u2019d never look at a flour tortilla the same way again; how could I, knowing what I know now? And so yes, I wholeheartedly recommend these tortillas to anyone who is ready to have their life changed forever. But if you\u2019d prefer to remain in a state of blissful ignorance, to go on enjoying fast-casual East Coast burritos and late-night quesadillas made on grocery store tortillas that are about as flavorful as the plastic bags they come in? Well, then I\u2019d recommend you steer clear of Las Cuatro Milpas\u2014don\u2019t make that line any longer for the rest of us.Go there: Las Cuatro MilpasExplore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsCaliforniaHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make.
