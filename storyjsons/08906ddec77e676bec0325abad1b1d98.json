Here are the cartoonish cocktails you\u2019ll want to swim in.By Jesse SparksSeptember 14, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie CraigFacebookTwitterEmailUnless you\u2019re fresh out of college, it\u2019s likely been a while since you plunged straw-first into a scorpion bowl with five of your closest friends. But we\u2019ve seen a return to the large-format cocktail at bars across the country recently. It seems like bartenders are having a ton of fun bringing back the comical classic. And while our coed days may be behind us, we have ambitious intentions of enjoying these gaudy giants at every available opportunity.Maybe it\u2019s the tower of garnishes that threaten to topple at any moment, maybe it\u2019s the exciting combinations of classic and completely unexpected ingredients. Does the idea of slurping a drink the size of your head make you cringe? \u201cSteer into the skid and embrace it,\u201d says Owen Thomson, owner of D.C. bar Archipelago. \u201cNinety-nine percent of the time people will look at your drink with jealousy. People usually see someone\u2019s flashy bowl on fire and say, \u2018I don\u2019t even need the menu\u2014just give me that.\u2019\u201dCheck out the mini lime island\u2014spotted at Archipelago in D.C.\nPhoto by Rey LopezWe love Archipelago for slinging monstrous cocktails like their Dr. Moreau\u2019s Vacation Retreat, named for the sci-fi film The Island of Dr. Moreau, which blends white and spiced rums with Chinese orange, honey, and fassionola (a traditional tiki cocktail syrup with bright notes of pineapple and hibiscus).Just up the coast in New York City, bartender Brian Miller of The Polynesian offers a group-sized Exotica Bowl for six to eight people. The giant punch bowl is filled with lime juice, green curry and coriander-infused rum, and swirls of lemon and lime juice, lemongrass and ginger syrups, and coconut cream. But if the sound of it isn\u2019t enough, the presentation more than makes up for it. The drink is served on a two-foot-long clam shell with smoke from dry ice pouring over the edges. Exhibit A:The Exotica Bowl at The Polynesian: Look, don\u2019t touch!\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig\u201cAll of my bartenders have to tell people not to touch or drink the dry ice, which seems like common sense, but we still have to say it,\u201d says Miller. \u201cTo paraphrase the Jeff Goldblum character in Jurassic Park, \u2018Just because you can, doesn\u2019t mean you should.\u2019\u201dThe bartenders at The Polynesian aren\u2019t the only ones shelling out (sorry) whimsical serving vessels. In Detroit, Mutiny Bar serves their drinks in large glasses shaped like owls. At Navy Strength in Seattle, one drink that serves seven to nine people is presented in a massive conch shell sprouting straws and edible flowers. Exhibit B:Navy Strength knows that the vessel is 50 percent of the fun.\nPhoto by Chona KasingerBut bartenders often offer an important piece of advice: The glasses may be fun, but the drinks are seriously spiked. \u201cAsk about ABV (alcohol by volume) when ordering,\u201d says Chris Elford of Navy Strength. \u201cSome people are trying to get their swerve on; some just want to enjoy the night.\u201dThere\u2019s an infectious glee that comes from leaning into the ridiculous, embracing the kitsch, and ordering the cartoonish cocktail. So throw on some sunnies and fire up the group chat, because you\u2019re gonna need backup.Now for something else, turn a cocktail into a pie:Explore Bon App\u00e9titCocktailRead MoreLifestyleHow Drinking CBD Cocktails Really Makes You FeelBy Kelly DobkincookingIf You\u2019re Going to Make a Tiki Drink at Home, Make This OneBy Emma WartzmanRecipes you want to make.
