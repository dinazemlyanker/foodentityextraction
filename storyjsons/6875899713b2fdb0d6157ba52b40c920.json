But while testing those recipes, I remembered my other issue with waffles, which is that the irons tend to trap steam\u2014the enemy of a crisp result. I ultimately got the recipes to work, but I swore off waffles again after I finished the book, this time forever.There are two small problems with my waffle ban, and their names are Jacob and Anna. I try to tell them that pancakes are basically the same thing, but they want the grid\u2014pooled with syrup, ideally. And so I dragged out the waffle iron (it\u2019s a $50 Hamilton Beach model if you\u2019re interested), determined to create a recipe that could be our new standard: easy (one bowl, hand-mixed), makeable without advance planning (no, I do not want to make waffle batter the night before), whole grain (which offsets the inevitable puddles of syrup, right?), and crispy (it turns out whole grains are great at this too).Finally, I wanted them to have a neutral palate for the adults who prefer our breakfasts savory. Sugar-free waffles allow us all to choose our own breakfast adventure: My husband and I top them with eggs and bacon or saut\u00e9ed vegetables and cheese, while the kids smother theirs with fruit and syrup. They\u2019re so good and so simple, the impossible has happened: I now regularly volunteer to make waffles.Get the recipe:Whole Wheat\u2013Oat WafflesCrispy, nutty whole-grain waffles that can go sweet or savory depending on your mood.View RecipeBuy it: Hamilton Beach Flip Belgian Waffle Maker, $50 at WalmartAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
