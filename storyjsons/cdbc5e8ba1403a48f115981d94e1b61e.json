When nutritional yeast is dissolved into water and reduced with onions, garlic, and ginger, it creates a deeply savory broth in very little time. Miso adds complexity (and, of course, saltiness)\u2014use 1 Tbsp. if you want a lighter broth or 2 Tbsp. if you want something more robust.The other components of this recipe are chickpeas\u2014some are fried for a crunchy topping, while the rest get super tender as they bubble away in the broth itself\u2014and noodles. You can use dried or fresh noodles. If using fresh noodles, like yakisoba, ramen, or pan-fry noodles, use 16 oz. and simply add them to the broth for the final minute or so to warm them through. If using dried noodles, like udon, use one package (between 8\u201310 oz.) and cook them separately while the soup simmers so they don\u2019t absorb all the luscious broth.The final component\u2014and what rounds this out into a complete meal\u2014is broccolini. Sweet and vegetal, it makes a particularly nice addition because its legginess imitates the long noodles. If you can\u2019t find it, however, feel free to use another quick-cooking green, like thinly sliced bok choy.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I used white miso (2 Tbsp) because that is what I had on hand, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was filling without being heavy and the chili oil was excellent for finishing to give it some heat without overpowering the flavors. We loved it and will definitely be making this again (and again!)AJRaleigh, NC3/18/2022We all loved it! The flavor has the right amount of umami to make it extremely cravable. I will definitely be adding this to our soup rotation. AnonymousBoston3/10/2022Good clean taste but flavour was quite mild. Might have been the miso I picked. Will add more next time.SarahVictoria, BC3/10/2022This is unbelievable. Possibly best vegan ramen I\u2019ve ever had.
