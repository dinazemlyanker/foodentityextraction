Drink Your Cocktails Out of a Vintage Smurf GlassRestaurateurs are scouring thrift stores and raiding their parents\u2019 attics for retro decal cups\u2014and we are here for it.By Hilary CadiganJanuary 28, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailUndercote in NYC boasts a large collection of vintage glassware.Photo by Laura MurrayFacebookTwitterEmailRemember those jelly jars with the cartoon characters that doubled as juice glasses after you used up all the jam? Man, those were cool. I don\u2019t even like jam but I piled GLOBS of that saccharine sludge onto my toast every morning and night just to complete the Bugs Bunny family reunion that was forming in my mom\u2019s kitchen cabinet. That\u2019s called dedication, folks. That\u2019s called suffering for your art.But unlike many of my childhood pleasures\u2014like forcing my little brother to play \u201cschool\u201d until he cried or organizing stickers by type with the fastidiousness of a serial killer\u2014my love of glasses with pictures on them remains fully intact. Even today, with 31 years to my name and a tired old heart full of dust and sand, these babies still spark joy.But I\u2019m not the only one feeling nostalgic. Lately, my colleagues and I have noticed these kitschy-on-purpose throwbacks showing up in bars and restaurants across the country, from L.A.\u2019s Ronan to Atlanta\u2019s 8arm. So we called up the owners to talk about their collections, how they acquired them, and the fuzzy feelings they dredge up in times that are bleak.The staff at Ronan in LA spent two years collecting vintage glasses like this one from local flea markets while they worked on the restaurant's buildout.\n\u201cDecal glasses take me back to Saturday morning cartoons,\u201d says Victoria James, beverage director at Undercote in NYC. \u201cIf a glass can bring you back to your childhood, well, that\u2019s certainly a good feeling for a cocktail.\u201d She and her team traveled upstate to build their collection, which now includes more than 20 types of glassware, from sculptural tea cups to \u201980s-era Smurf glasses. \u201cWe found some at an old yard sale and sent a picture to the group like, \u2018Are these cheesy?\u2019 And everyone responded, \u2018No! Those are great. You HAVE to get them.\u2019\u201dMason Hereford, owner of Turkey and the Wolf in New Orleans, credits his mom for discovering the motherlode (heh heh) at a junk shop in Greenwood, Virginia\u2014including a Camp Snoopy cup from McDonald\u2019s and a Return of the Jedi promotional glass dating back to 1983. \u201cWe love them because they match the fun, hodgepodge, easygoing nature of our restaurant,\u201d he says. As someone who once collected so many McDonald\u2019s Happy Meal toys that I eventually made $2 selling them for a penny each at the local playground, I can relate.Safta's rosebud glasses bring grandma-friendly vibes to the industrial Denver restaurant.\n\u201cMy grandmother, my mom, and I have all been collecting vintage glassware for years,\u201d says Emily Shaya, co-owner of Safta in Denver. The modern Israeli restaurant has industrial vibes, but Shaya says the midcentury rosebud-printed glassware she found for serving drinks lends a special kinda warmth. \u201cThey\u2019re inspired by the cups my husband [co-owner Alon Shaya] grew up seeing in his grandmother\u2019s home.\u201dAndrea Carr of re.Find Vintage has been more successful than I in the secondhand game, and now makes a living selling antique barware to restaurants like Yellow Door Taqueria in Boston. She says stocking your cabinets with decal glasses is easy; they\u2019re both plentiful and affordable at thrift stores across the country, and shouldn\u2019t cost more than about $5\u2013$10 each (though complete sets and rarer collections will run higher). For first-timers seeking a more targeted selection, the internet reigns supreme. Typing \u201cvintage decal glasses\u201d into Etsy or eBay will bring up an array of options, and Carr also recommends online shops like Amy\u2019s Vintage Decorium or itsnotjustcocktails.com.The vintage leopard glasses at Rita in Brooklyn came from a thrift store upstate.\nMary Ellen Amato, owner of Rita in Brooklyn, says that her vintage glasses are both the cheapest and most-loved purchase she\u2019s ever made for the cafe. \u201cAfter spending my entire life savings opening up a restaurant, I was broke,\u201d she recalls. One weekend, she closed down and headed upstate to her parents\u2019 place for a break. \u201cI wandered into a very old-school thrift store, and there, I saw them\u2014safari-themed with leopards. The older woman working behind the counter was so thrilled to get rid of the \u2018ugly cups' that she threw in a free James Taylor cassette tape as a thank you.\u201dAnd that, folks, is called the life-changing magic of decal glasses.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsDesignRecipes you want to make.
