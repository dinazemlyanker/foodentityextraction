You can\u2019t blame the dish\u2014it\u2019s fighting an uphill battle: Waffles are fun! Pancakes are adaptable! French toast is\u2026 bread. Dipped in goop? You can understand why it\u2019s taking up the rear\u2014and why, at least in my mind, it is 100 percent a food you only make at home, never order in a restaurant. French toast is the best thing that almost-stale bread can become, but a \u201cuse it up\u201d mentality isn\u2019t the same as a \u201ctreat yourself\u201d one. Despite it\u2019s solid spot in the breakfast top three, plain French toast just isn\u2019t that special.Growing up, however, I did order French toast regularly at one establishment, a caf\u00e9 and bakery in my hometown in Northern California called the Rising Loafer. The original location has since closed, but the space is still clear in my mind: butter yellow walls with fake cracks and vines painted on them, rows of crusty bread behind the cash register, and a big outdoor patio that was prime real estate on Saturday mornings. Without fail I would order the orange-raspberry French toast, made with thick slices of their house-made bread. The fruity flavors came from a glug of orange juice whisked right into the batter and a bright raspberry pur\u00e9e drizzled over the top\u2014a combo that felt, despite its French toast base, very special indeed. I would also add butter and syrup (duh), then clean my plate of every last drop.I started re-creating the dish once I moved away from home but tweaked it ever so slightly: Because I never keep OJ in the house and always have a jar or two of Bonne Maman, I\u2019ll whisk a big scoop of jam directly into the batter instead\u2014a way to get the topping into the slice itself. The result is a sweet and subtly fruity dish, tinted ever so slightly by the color of the jam (though you can usually only see it once you cut inside). The sugar in the jam helps the outside of the French toast caramelize a bit more than your standard variety, and it almost doesn't need any extra toppings\u2026 though if you add butter and syrup, you wouldn\u2019t be alone.Making your own jam-infused French toast is as simple as whisking jam into your French toast batter, but there are a few tips to keep in mind. First, start with the custard mixture from your favorite classic recipe; one without any bells or whistles is ideal, and if you\u2019re using a very sweet jam, omit the added sugar. Any flavor jam will work\u2014I\u2019ve tried berry, stone fruit, fig, orange marmalade, even pear and apple butter\u2014as long as it\u2019s not too chunky, since those bigger bits of fruit will get left behind in the batter bowl. I like to use 1 scant Tbsp. jam per egg in the custard, but your perfect ratio will depend on the brand and style you use. Give your jam a vigorous stir by itself first to smooth it out; if it\u2019s really thick, whisk it with a teaspoon or two of warm water in a bowl to loosen the spread and help it integrate completely with the eggs and cream later on. Then add any ground spices and extracts you\u2019d like: For berry jams, I\u2019ll add a bit of vanilla extract to the batter; for stone fruits, just a smidge of almond extract; for orange marmalade, a sprinkle of ground cardamom.Finally, proceed as you would normally, giving your bread ample time to soak in the custard and plenty of fat to cook in. A little char and caramelization is natural thanks to the sugar in the jam, so keep an eye on your heat and how quickly the slices brown. I\u2019m not saying this version will knock pancakes or waffles out of the breakfast baking top spot, but it at least gives French toast a fighting chance.Explore Bon App\u00e9titBreakfastcookingRecipes you want to make.
