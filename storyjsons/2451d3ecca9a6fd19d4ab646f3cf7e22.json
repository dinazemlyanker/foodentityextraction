Inspired by chefs like Patch Troffer, formerly of Brooklyn\u2019s Marlow & Sons, we\u2019ve been treating slabs of gorgeously marbled (and affordable!) pork shoulder the way we would a New York strip\u2014by searing it to a juicy medium-rare. Don\u2019t see pork shoulder steaks at the store? They\u2019re there, we swear, they just might not be cut yet. Politely ask the butcher to take an even, compact hunk of Boston butt and slice it against the grain into \u00be\"- to 1\"-thick slabs. Ta-da\u2014pork steaks! Or if you like: Take one home and do it yourself.Ingredients4 servings Sauce2Tbsp. finely grated peeled horseradish or 1 Tbsp. (packed) drained prepared horseradish2Tbsp.

Grill, turning every 1\u20132 minutes, until lightly charred and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of pork registers 140\u00b0, 7\u20139 minutes.

Top with horseradish and sprinkle with reserved nori powder.How would you rate Pork Shoulder Steaks With Horseradish-Mustard Sauce?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (4)Back to TopTriangleI very seldom cook red meat so was thrilled with how this came out. I did marinate the pork stakes overnight in an impromptu mix of soy sauce, red wine vinegar, ginger and garlic. Prepped everything today with all the listed ingredients except the ground mustard. I also roasted them in the over at 325 for about 25 mins and they came out perfect. Flavorful, and tender enough to cut with a butter knife. Paired with some roasted green beans and shallots and voila!BilliePittsburgh, PA4/1/2021Delicious and easy. Didn\u2019t have any nori. Subbed finely chopped garlic for garlic powder and some wasabi for horseradish cause I couldn\u2019t find any at the grocery store. Seared in my cast iron on the stove with the vent on high. So fire. AnonymousSan Francisco6/19/2020Excellent! I subbed ginger for the horseradish (one of the very few ingredients I just don\u2019t like) and it was very tasty. Smbarber85Indiana 6/13/2020This was so good!  I used both bone-in pork shoulder steaks and bone-in pork loin chops for a comparison and, while both were fantastic, the pork steaks were my group's favorite.  Cannot wait to make this again.AnonymousJacksonville, FL6/8/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titHorseradishHerbs & SpicesPork ShoulderPorkMeatSummerMainGluten-FreeDairy-FreeGrillingDinnerRecipes you want to make.
