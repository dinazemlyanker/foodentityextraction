In Tagalog, \u201clola\u201d means grandmother, but my lola is actually my grandmother\u2019s sister. She was a military wife\u2014my lolo was stationed at Fort Lewis, just outside of Tacoma\u2014and because of her, my whole family was able to come over to the United States. Everything Lola cooked tasted better. She would serve us all these American foods that we didn\u2019t eat at home like roast beef, lasagna. But even Filipino dishes like lumpia were different at Lola\u2019s house. I remember thinking, \u201cWhy does everything taste better when Lola makes it?\u201d Only when I was older and started cooking myself did I learn her secret: Johnny\u2019s Seasoning Salt.Johnny\u2019s Seasoning Salt is a blend of sea salt, MSG, paprika, garlic salt, onion powder, and other spices, and it\u2019s absolutely magic in a bottle. It\u2019s similar to Lawry\u2019s, but unlike Lawry\u2019s, it doesn\u2019t contain sugar. These days Johnny\u2019s makes a non-MSG version, but the original recipe is where it\u2019s at. I use it in everything, and there is nothing that it doesn\u2019t improve. At my restaurant, Musang, you won\u2019t find actual salt on the line\u2014you\u2019ll find Johnny\u2019s.For the home cook, Johnny\u2019s is all about convenience and versatility. Why have five bottles of spices and seasonings when you can have one? I call for it in my recipes for chicken adobo, winter greens laing, sarciadong isda, and garlic fried rice, but it\u2019ll give any meat, seafood, or veggie remarkable depth. It\u2019s also life-changing on popcorn or salted peanuts with fried garlic. Just use a light hand at first\u2014it\u2019s so flavorful that you might need less seasoning than you\u2019re used to.Who is this mysterious Johnny? John Meaker, who passed away in 2001 at the age of 96, was a Tacoma restaurateur who launched his line of seasonings in the \u201850s. Johnny\u2019s Fine Foods is still independently owned and manufactured in Washington state, which is quite a feat in an industry dominated by major spice and seasoning corporations. I\u2019ve tried to get in touch with the company\u2014I\u2019ve sent emails, I\u2019ve tagged them on Instagram\u2014because I need them to know how much this yellow bottle means to me. If anyone from Johnny\u2019s Fine Foods is reading this, thank you for cherished childhood memories and for bringing my family together. Johnny\u2019s tastes like home. When my cousins and I visit each other, if someone says, \u201cThis needs more salt,\u201d we all know they don\u2019t mean actual salt. They mean Johnny\u2019s.Photo by Emma FishmanJohnny's Seasoning Salt$7 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
