Briny half-sour pickle bits provide bright pops of contrast, but any chopped pickle-y thing\u2014think spicy peperoncini, giardiniera, or full-sour cukes\u2014would work great too.This recipe is presented to you by Samsung.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

This recipe was amazing, even to someone like me who doesn\u2019t like eggplant! I used dill pickles instead of half sour and it was still delicious. It came together in 10 minutes and was gone in the same amount of time. Anonymous10/5/2020HUGE hit at the Christmas party. One change I'd make is even less garlic. The raw garlic was so intense it was almost spicy. Not ideal for parties where you might not want to smell like a garlic clove. Other than that, absolutely loved it! Making it again right now. kenzieforrestcanton, ohio12/24/2019Loved it! \nDesislava11/4/2018Thoughts on how to incorporate the eggplant skin?allilankNYC6/12/2018Wonderful idea with eggplant, just love it.
