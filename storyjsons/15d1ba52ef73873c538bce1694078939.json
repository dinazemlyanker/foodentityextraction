Try to seek out whole lemongrass stalks that have the meatier bulbous parts near the root ends intact; you can find them in some grocery stores and most well-stocked Asian markets. Pair this with Leela\u2019s summery menu for Grilled Pork Shoulder Steaks With Green Pepper Relish, Khao Niao (Thai Sticky Rice), Cantaloupe With Spicy Bacon-Cashew Crumble, Cucumber, Tomato, and Green Bean Salad, and Grilled Scallops With Peach Sweet Chili Sauce.\u00a0All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.
