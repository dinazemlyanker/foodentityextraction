Sometimes they\u2019re hardy and invincible: You can cook them hot and fast with excellent results. But other times they\u2019re sensitive and fragile. They threaten to crack open if a pot of water is too hot. They burst and curdle and weep and stick\u2014point is, eggs need a little TLC. And that\u2019s especially true when it comes to changes in temperature.Let\u2019s say you\u2019re adding raw eggs (or egg yolks) to a pot of hot liquid (or hot pasta). If you pour the eggs straight into the simmering cauldron, they\u2019ll scramble almost immediately. That\u2019s great, and intended, if you\u2019ve set out to make egg drop soup, tomato and egg, or stracciatella. It\u2019s a lot less desirable if you\u2019re looking to harness eggs\u2019 thickening power to achieve a creamy pudding, lemon curd, ice cream base, or carbonara that\u2019s not flecked with cooked egg. In the case of this avgolemono-inspired lemony tortellini soup, the goal is to cook the eggs slowly, rather than all at once, so that they provide body and richness to the broth instead of curdling into discrete bits.\u201cI've got the right temperature to temper you from the storm?\u201d\nTo solve the problem, you have to temper the eggs: Essentially, this means slowly diluting them with a bit of the hot liquid before letting them into the pot to join the party. (Think of it like the eggs are\u2026pregaming? Remember those days?) This gives the eggs a head start in cooking and, as the folks at Cook\u2019s Illustrated explain, makes it harder for their proteins to link up and form bonds (i.e., get scrambled) as they\u2019re heated.Here\u2019s how to temper eggs:Have a whisk and a ladle or measuring cup nearby.Crack your eggs into a bowl or large liquid measuring cup that\u2019s big enough to hold at least a couple of cups of liquid and can accommodate a whisk. If you\u2019re making a custard base, say for ice cream or pudding, you might also be incorporating sugar. Whisk the eggs (or yolks) to homogenize.Stabilize that bowl (if it's large or cumbersome) with a damp towel so that both of your hands are free\u2014you\u2019ll see why in a minute. You can use the towel to form a little nest for your bowl by rolling it into a log, then shaping it into a hollow ring and resting your bowl inside.Once your liquid is hot, use the ladle or measuring cup to slowly dribble it into the eggs, whisking constantly all the while. I like to pour with my non-dominant hand so that I can whisk with my more adept one. (In the case of an egg-based pasta sauce, like carbonara, you'll likely be dribbling some reserved pasta water into the eggs to warm and loosen them.)Touch your egg mixture (like, stick a clean finger in there!). If it\u2019s very warm, you\u2019re good to go. If it\u2019s not, keep adding liquid until it gets there.Now slowly pour that egg mixture back into the pot, still whisking or stirring constantly.Continue to cook, whisking frequently (there\u2019s a lot of whisking involved here) and being sure to scrape the sides and the bottom of the pot, until you\u2019ve reached your desired indicator (in the case of many custards, you\u2019re looking for the mixture to coat the back of a spoon) or temperature.In some (fussy) instances for soups and custards, recipes will have you strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to ensure that not even one singular lump can sneak by. But for this soup there\u2019s enough going on\u2014tortellini, spinach, dill, parm\u2014that one teeny curd of egg isn\u2019t going to be a bother. A whole pot of scrambled eggs, though? Well, then it\u2019s a different dish entirely.Soup's on!Lemony Tortellini Soup with Spinach and DillSilky and comforting yet light and spring-y, this tortellini and spinach soup is the perfect winter-to-spring meal.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titEggRecipes you want to make.
