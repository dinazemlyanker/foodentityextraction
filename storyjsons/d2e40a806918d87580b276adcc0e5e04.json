We asked 80 of the most interesting people we know to reveal the local spots they love the most.There\u2019s an empty chair in the center of the action at Bertha\u2019s Kitchen, the Charleston soul food institution that\u2019s been serving hot plates of collard greens, fried chicken, and lima beans since it opened in 1981. The chair, humble and threadbare black leather, was where matriarch Albertha Grant watched over and instructed her children as they prepared for the lunchtime rush. What began as a home-cooked operation on one stove in a motel became a neighborhood restaurant fueled by unconditional love (and plenty of fry oil), winning the James Beard Award for America\u2019s Classic in 2017. Grant passed away in 2007, and now her children own the place. But Bertha\u2019s spirit fills the bright blue dining room where her portrait hangs on the wall in a gilt frame. One steamy May afternoon, not even the clap of storm clouds could keep the faithful away. As trays of barbecued pig\u2019s feet, oxtail, yams, and smothered pork chops passed us by, we stuck around for an afternoon.Bertha's Kitchen, Charleston, SCPhoto by Peter Frank Edwards/Redux\u201cThe first time I met the special friend in my life was at Bertha\u2019s,\u201d says Cynthia Sweeney, Charleston native, retired teacher (pictured far right). \u201cWe are both seniors and we weren\u2019t looking for anybody in our lives. He had just gotten off from work. I saw him get out of his vehicle in a rush. Just playfully I said, \u2018I see you trying to rush and get in front of me\u2019 because I know the line gets long sometimes. He said, \u2018Actually, I\u2019m rushing so I can open the door for you.\u2019 That was three years ago. We\u2019ve been with each other ever since.\u201dBertha's Kitchen, Charleston, SCPhoto by Peter Frank Edwards/ReduxKabriera Singleton, daughter of Linda Pinckney and one of Bertha\u2019s granddaughters, serves up fragrant bowls of collard greens, her hands adorned with eye-catching gold bangles and pearlescent-tipped nails.Bertha's Kitchen, Charleston, SCPhoto by Peter Frank Edwards/Redux\u201cOne day Ms. Bertha was leaving to go and I stopped her,\u201d says Mamie Cooper, Charleston native, retired, mother of two, grandmother to six, \u201cI said \u2018Ms. Bertha, your food is so good. Did your mother teach you how to cook?\u2019 She said \u2018No, not really. My mother didn\u2019t teach me all of that. A lot of that I learned on my own.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, your food is exceptional. It has me coming back for more.\u2019 That was over 15 years ago.\u201dBertha's Kitchen, Charleston, SCPhoto by Peter Frank Edwards/ReduxThe $8 meat-and-three: A plate of barbecue chicken, macaroni and cheese, collard greens, and cornbread.Bertha's Kitchen, Charleston, SCPhoto by Peter Frank Edwards/ReduxWhissette and LaTonta Wright are visiting from Charlotte and don\u2019t have time to waste on mediocre food: \u201cWe were led to Bertha\u2019s out of frustration. Every time we come [to Charleston], we always end up at some of the more touristy, froufrou kinds of places. We order the fried chicken, collard greens, butter beans, and rice, and it actually tastes like my grandmama made it. Everything is like it was when I was growing up. We can\u2019t duplicate that kind of cooking now. We\u2019re two generations removed from my grandmama, and this just tastes like home.\u201dBertha's Kitchen, Charleston, SCPhoto by Peter Frank Edwards/ReduxDuring morning prep, the chefs focus on the task at hand.Bertha's Kitchen, Charleston, SCPhoto by Peter Frank Edwards/Redux\u201cWe\u2019re family-orientated,\u201d says Julia Grant, one of Bertha\u2019s three daughters and the restaurant\u2019s current owner, \u201cWe know a lot of people in the area, and we have a lot of regulars who come in all the time. It\u2019s common courtesy that keeps them coming back. We\u2019re nice to people; they are nice to us. It\u2019s not hard for a stranger to come in and say what they want and feel welcome.\u201dBertha's Kitchen, Charleston, SCPhoto by Peter Frank Edwards/ReduxBertha\u2019s walls are covered in family memories. Here, a portrait of Bertha with her three daughters, Julia Grant, Linda Pinckney, and Sharon Coakley, painted by a family friend, warmly greets customers as they come inside.Bertha's Kitchen, Charleston, SCPhoto by Peter Frank Edwards/ReduxThe energy is fast and bustling as soon as the doors open, with Bertha\u2019s staff feverishly writing down and calling out orders in a language all their own. It\u2019s hard for the untrained ear to understand, but with years of practice, Bertha\u2019s staff understand one another perfectly without missing a beat.Bertha's Kitchen, Charleston, SCPhoto by Peter Frank Edwards/Redux\u201cThe first time I came to Bertha\u2019s was for a political meeting,\u201d says Rodney Williams, Charleston native. \u201cI am a former city councilman for the city of Charleston. Bertha\u2019s is still known as a political hub where you can find out what\u2019s going on around town. I always see someone I know.\u201dBertha's Kitchen, Charleston, SCPhoto by Peter Frank Edwards/ReduxThree generations of mothers, daughters, and staff pose proudly in front of a large family portrait that hangs in pride of place on a wall covered in photos and awards\u2014a memorial to the woman and family legacy that makes Bertha\u2019s so unique.Bertha's Kitchen, Charleston, SCPhoto by Peter Frank Edwards/ReduxThroughout the day the perpetual line at Bertha\u2019s becomes a crossroads for familiar faces, friends, family, and neighbors\u2014many of whom have been coming to Bertha\u2019s for years\u2014to exchange greetings, news, condolences, and hugs.Bertha's Kitchen, Charleston, SCPhoto by Peter Frank Edwards/ReduxBy 1 p.m. staff come from around the counter to take orders on the backs of Styrofoam containers to help move the line along. The scrape of metal dishware and the chatter of eager customers rises above the sound of the torrential rain outside.Bertha's Kitchen, Charleston, SCPhoto by Peter Frank Edwards/ReduxOur lunch: baked macaroni and cheese, collard greens, lima bean soup, okra, and cornbread.Bertha's Kitchen, Charleston, SCPhoto by Peter Frank Edwards/ReduxOwner Julia Grant won\u2019t be found sitting in a back office somewhere. She remains on the front lines at Bertha\u2019s from open to close, serving up smothered chicken and combo plates every day without fail.Bertha's Kitchen, Charleston, SCPhoto by Peter Frank Edwards/Redux\u201cI patronize this place because I have a crew,\u201d says Alonzo Wright, the owner of a drywall and construction company (wearing the Bluetooth earpiece above), \u201cwe come here and buy a lot of food. And they are warm-hearted people. They have that mentality that just makes you want to keep coming back. I\u2019m the type of person, it don\u2019t matter if I come in here covered with sheetrock, dust. It doesn\u2019t matter if I have ten different colors of paint on me. It doesn\u2019t matter. That\u2019s how they know me. I always have that attitude, that happy spirit, no matter what\u2019s going on. I could go wake a graveyard up.\u201dBertha's Kitchen, Charleston, SCPhoto by Peter Frank Edwards/ReduxLinda Pinckney, one of Bertha\u2019s three daughters, says:  \u201cIt always gets to me when I think about where we started and where we are now. I think about all the hard work my mom did and the hard work my sisters put into it. Our mother\u2019s spirit is what gets us up in the morning.\u201dBertha's Kitchen, Charleston, SCPhoto by Peter Frank Edwards/ReduxMen gather out front of Bertha\u2019s to shoot the breeze.Bertha's Kitchen, Charleston, SCPhoto by Peter Frank Edwards/ReduxMaestro Julia Grant stirs the pot.Bertha's Kitchen, Charleston, SCPhoto by Peter Frank Edwards/ReduxFor many of their customers, Bertha\u2019s is their first stop from the airport. Sometimes people literally have their luggage.Bertha's Kitchen, Charleston, SCPhoto by Peter Frank Edwards/ReduxNo meal is complete without a Styrofoam cup of Bertha\u2019s sweet and tart lemonade or Southern sweet tea to wash it down.Bertha's Kitchen, Charleston, SCPhoto by Peter Frank Edwards/ReduxA square of cornbread gets wrapped like the gift it is.Bertha's Kitchen, Charleston, SCPhoto by Peter Frank Edwards/ReduxBertha confers her blessing from a portrait that hangs on the wall where orders are picked up.Bertha's Kitchen, Charleston, SCPhoto by Peter Frank Edwards/ReduxKabriera Singleton recites Bertha\u2019s weekly menu offerings like steps from a spellbook she\u2019s learned by rote. \u201cOne of our regular customers, Mr. George, likes the restaurant so much,\u201d says Singleton, that \u201che\u2019ll come early before the rush to help unload the truck and fill the ice chest.\u201dAnd after the last meal was marked, filled, packed, and paid for, we were on our way. But tomorrow, we knew, Bertha\u2019s would be there.Chase Quinn is a writer in Charleston.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Explore Bon App\u00e9titNeighborhood RestaurantsRecipes you want to make.
