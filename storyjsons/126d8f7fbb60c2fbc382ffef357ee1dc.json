And with it, the nectar of the gods: corn milk.By Alex BeggsAugust 12, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Laura Murray, Food styling by Sohla El-WayllyFacebookTwitterEmailRemember when Meet the Parents was the funniest movie, and people loved to do that nipple-tugging gesture, and ha-ha-ha you can milk a cat, and it never got old? Until it did! Circa 2011. So I mostly forgot about it until I had to write this piece. Thankfully, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing with corn. Not that. Not that at all.We\u2019re cutting the corn kernels off per usual and then scraping the naked cob with the back of a knife to release the corn milk. That is milking corn. Nothing creepy, unless you want it to be, in which case, what you do in your kitchen is your business.Why do we milk corn? (Not to be confused with this sweet Sichuan corn milk drink.) Because the sweet\u2014and yes, milky\u2014juices are concentrated corn flavor. In Sohla El-Waylly\u2019s new recipe for Corn and Peach Chaat, the corn milk adds sweetness you\u2019d typically get from chutney in chaat, and that sweetness balances the savory chaat masala and spicy chiles and ginger. Also, corn milk is starchy. When you make a dressing with it\u2014raw\u2014as in this recipe, it gets creamy and clings to every kernel.When you cook with corn milk, it really thickens up. Sohla says she makes creamed corn without any actual cream, relying on the corn milk to get the job done.These scallops love corn milk.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t scrape your corn, you\u2019re losing a lot,\u201d Sohla says. Here\u2019s a tip: Don\u2019t cut the corn all the way to the cob. Shave off the flavorful, juicy corn kernel tops and leave the fibrous root behind. That\u2019s the stuff that gets stuck in your teeth anyway, and it\u2019ll leave more material to make corn milk with. Also: It\u2019s important to use fresh, in-season, good corn for this to succeed, she adds. The stuff in grocery stores mid-December is mostly likely too dry and sadly bland.Elsewhere, Amiel Stanek\u2019s admittedly absurd triple corn polenta gets super luscious thanks to starchy corn milk. It thickens Claire Saffitz\u2019s Basically corn salsa (she also smashes the cobs). It sweetens the sauce in Molly Baz\u2019s scallops with chorizo and corn. I also came across a handful of corn recipes that don\u2019t use it and should, and those will remain nameless, but if you\u2019re making ANY corn salad or muffins, or adding it to pasta or a fun random stir-fry\u2014add the milk! Don\u2019t let that sweet summer nectar go to waste.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCornSummerRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
