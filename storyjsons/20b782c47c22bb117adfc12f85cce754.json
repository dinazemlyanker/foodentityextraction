He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.If the past six weeks have taught us anything as home cooks, it\u2019s that recipes are malleable. Substitutions should not only be allowed, they should be encouraged. They help you become a better, more confident cook.We\u2019ve all had to do with fewer trips to the market, and we can\u2019t always access those hard-to-find ingredients that brands like this one sometimes call for. So what did we all do? We adapted and we kept cooking.The other day, I defrosted a pack of Denver steaks I had bought at Dickson\u2019s Farmstand Market in New York City. Imagine a boneless ribeye, and that\u2019s essentially a Denver steak\u2014a six-inch long cylinder, striated with ribbons of marbled fat. Rich, beefy, and delicious.My wife and I seared off two in a cast-iron skillet for dinner, but we had two remaining. A couple days later I got in my head that I would make Basically\u2019s Beef and Bacon Stew, a simplified version of Beef Bourguignon. Nevermind that it called for a couple of pounds of boneless chuck\u2014I figured a hearty cut like Denver steak would bring the same collagen-rich quality to the braise. And because I had only about 10 ounces of steak, I\u2019d just reduce the rest of the recipe accordingly. The fact that I had a leftover, barely half-full bottle of red wine on the counter made the decision that much easier.Want this letter before it hits the website?

I didn\u2019t have fresh oregano, but I did have some just-picked marjoram that a gardener friend dropped off\u2014close enough. A tablespoon of flour served as a thickening agent, while the wine and a cup of water provided the braising liquid. Into the oven it all went for about 90 minutes.Now, if this were a baking project, I wouldn\u2019t advocate the same this-for-that approach. Baking, as everyone likes to say, is a science. Recipes include all sorts of precise measurements for a reason. But braising, stir-frying, roasting\u2014they\u2019re techniques. Stick with what you know and sub in ingredients as necessary.Ninety minutes later, when my iPhone timer chirped, I was feeling pretty good about my steak-and-bacon stew. And then my wife walked into the house after going for a hike, \u201cOh my god\u2014what smells so good?!\u201dRecipe (kinda, sorta) followed; mission accomplished.Get the recipe:Beef and Bacon StewYou can call it beef bourguignon if you want to sound fancy\u2014nobody has to know how much easier it is than the French classic.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterRead MoreCoronavirus7 Tips for Making Your Best Pot of Dried Beans, Even If It's Your FirstBy Caroline LangecookingHow to Turn Basically's Focaccia into Focaccia PIZZA!By Sarah JampelcookingMy Favorite (Only?)
