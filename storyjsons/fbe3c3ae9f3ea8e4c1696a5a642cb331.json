See our past recommendations here!As a working mother living in New York City, I\u2019m proud of myself for getting any dinner on the table, even if that\u2019s gloops of iridescent orange mac and cheese from a box. But when I manage to serve my husband and son fish\u2014known to be exceptionally healthy and filled with calcium, protein, vitamins, and the all-important omega-3 fatty acids\u2014I feel like a supermom.To be clear, cooking the fish is easy enough. It\u2019s the buying bit that\u2019s complicated. Seafood is a murky industry rife with problems: mislabeled fish at markets and restaurants; farmed versus wild and which is more sustainable (Both? Neither? I still don\u2019t know); overfishing and species depletion (horrifyingly, scientists have theorized that our oceans could be fishless by 2048!); and all those essentially nonrecyclable, plastic-wrapped Styrofoam trays (the most popular packaging choice for seafood, meat, and poultry). With all of that to consider, what\u2019s a supermom to do?The answer to my plea came in January when a PureFish Rainbow Box landed on my doorstep. The San Diego\u2013based company, which stocks restaurants like Soho House (nationwide), Lionfish in San Diego and Florida, and Wynn in Las Vegas, had just launched its direct-to-consumer arm, promising to deliver the same \u201cfine dining quality sustainable seafood\u201d to homes across the U.S.As I unboxed my jewel-toned haul of shrimp, salmon, tuna, and striped bass, the first thing I noticed was the packaging: no Styrofoam in sight! Each fleshy cut of fish was packed in oven-ready recycled aluminum trays\u2014and those trays were nestled in packing insulation made from recycled cotton and denim that\u2019s sourced from places like Goodwill. Even though the last few years have seen a switch to paper takeout containers and coffee cups (thanks to plastic and Styrofoam bans in some cities and states) and paper crinkles instead of packing peanuts, Styrofoam\u2014which makes up 30 percent of landfills worldwide\u2014is still the norm for raw meat, poultry, and fish. Along with ditching Styrofoam, PureFish claims it uses less single-use plastic than you\u2019d typically find in other fish packaging.But it wasn\u2019t only the environmentally friendlier outside that enamored me. Inside, each tray held two frozen, fully-trimmed, and ready to cook center cuts (as opposed to cuts from near the head or tail of a fish, where there\u2019s less flesh). I\u2019ve always been skeptical of frozen fish because it seems like it just wouldn\u2019t be as fresh, but PureFish shock-freezes its fish as soon as they\u2019re caught\u2014and each one I tried was delicious. I also loved that the fish is thoughtfully sourced and fully traceable, as I discovered when I scanned the QR codes on each tray that let you \u201cmeet the fisherman.\u201dAfter lightly seasoning and searing some thawed tuna fillets to serve with a soy-ginger sauce and charred bok choy, my family and I dug in. It was tender, flavorful, and delicious. Better yet, I\u2019d finally found a way to buy fish I felt fully good about\u2014even if I still couldn\u2019t convince my son it was better than boxed mac and cheese.The Rainbow Box$250 at PureFishExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish Loves ItShoppingRecipes you want to make.
