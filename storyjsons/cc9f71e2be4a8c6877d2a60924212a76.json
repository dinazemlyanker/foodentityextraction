Coconut milk and shrimp are natural dancing partners, rounded out with the earthy note of ghee laced with a tapestry of spices. The shrimp should be marinated for about 1 hour to infuse them with flavor, but otherwise this dish comes together quickly, making it an ideal family meal on a weekday that calls for something special.\u00a0It was in Puri where I tried my first shrimp, which my father had bought from one of the train vendors. They were covered in a fiery red chile sauce that I didn\u2019t realize also contained large chunks of pineapple, which when covered in sauce closely resembled the shape and size of the shrimp. I took a bite of what I thought was shrimp but was actually pineapple and exclaimed to my dad, \u2018Shrimp tastes just like pineapple!\u2019 The incident still makes him laugh, and whenever he visits one of my restaurants in Nashville, I inevitably hear him tell this story at least once to a tableful of customers. Pineapple is not a traditional ingredient in chungdi malai, but sometimes I add it, especially when preparing it for my father, because it always gets a laugh out of him. If you\u2019d like to include pineapple, add 1 cup coarsely chopped fresh or canned pineapple when you add the coconut milk.\u201dReprinted with permission from Chaat by Maneet Chauhan and Jody Eddy copyright \u00a9 2020.

A joy to eat and look at.Toasted NutsRomania11/9/2021Hey. I have noticed a few comments regarding the printing issue. If you scroll down below the Ingredients List a tad it will appear on the left hand side. I had the same issue, looking looking looking..... found it. \nI hope this helps :) TeresaGreenNew Zealand 8/10/2021I thought this was just excellent. Very flavorful & really pretty easy. I added a chopped zucchini & diced red bell pepper and I thought they went with it really well. AnonymousSouth Carolina 3/21/2021Thanks for the button newsDamaschkeOntario2/8/2021The print button, along with a mail button and a Pinterest button, drops down on the left hand sideSelenaPort Hope Ontario1/15/2021This was... just fine. Tried this out because I\u2019m a huge chopped fan (lol @ the comment below saying this recipe is appropriated... did you even look at the byline?). This recipe is perhaps meant for actual chefs. I had trouble eyeballing the spices and salt and guessing when to add them in. I used butter instead of ghee because I am a disgrace to my ancestors. FatimaNew York, NY12/29/2020I think the print button moved to a bar along the left side of the window - not immediately intuitive, but it's there!Lori MPort Washington, WI12/5/2020Like others below I can't find a print button-- until recently most BA recipes had this but now I can't find it.  It is a real deterrent to trying the recipes as I have to copy and paste into a Word document.  Can you bring the print button back?  Many thanks!D MorganSaskatoon, SK12/4/2020This was excellent. Made as recommended, but I think in the future I would spend less time breaking up the cinnamon, seeing as how you have to dig it out later. A little spicy, but pleasantly so.AdizzleMichigan11/22/2020This was really good\u2014restaurant quality, in fact. I wasn't sure when I read the first few ingredients, but it all came together well. I had Kashmiri curry, too. Just the right amount of heat for us. I was careful not to overcook the shrimp, and they were tender and flavorful. A definite keeper for me.Marlene BSan Diego, CA11/19/2020Thank you for specifying \"unsweetened coconut milk\" in your recipe.  I get so confused when recipes, especially Indian or Pakistani recipes on other sites call for coconut milk but don't specify sweetened or unsweetened.  I learn which when the recipe is completed and often inedible because of my choice of milk.SDTrianoFlorida11/15/2020I would really like Bon Appetit to put the nutritional values in their recipes.  My husband is on a salt-restricted diet, and I'd love to know the sodium content. Sue W.Vermont11/14/2020This was a HUGE hit with my family (even the 2 toddlers gobbled it up, asking for more, \"bite, bite, bites!\").  I served it on a weeknight, prepared everything early (covering in fridge till actual cooking time).  A truly enjoyable experience... herbs filling the kitchen, transporting me back to Winter Solstice holidays from days past! \nPS.  To answer Ashley's question, this recipe fed 2 adults, 2 toddlers (ages 2 & 4); no left-overs :)lmsDurham, NC11/13/2020Hi there! this looks so delicious and i can't wait to try it!
