This time around: knives.Just like when you're buying a car and suddenly you need to understand terms like MPG (okay, that one's basic) and \u201cHarmon Kardon\" (okay, that one's esoteric), buying the right knife requires learning a few terms and variables. Reading this article will certainly not make you an expert\u2014sorry, it's just that people devote their entire careers to learning about knives. But it will give you a lot of the vocabulary you need to ask the right questions to yourself and in some cases to the very nice salesperson helping you (maybe on the other side of the internet).Whether you're angling for a Japanese-style or Western knife, browsing the web or shopping IRL, keep these elements in mind:How much should I pay?What makes some knives sooo much more expensive than others? It comes down to the materials used (is the handle plastic or wood? how is the steel treated?), the way the knife is crafted (is it finished by hand or by machine?), and the level of detail and perfection (some knives are essentially works of art).That doesn't mean you can't find a great knife within your budget. You might need to focus on the element (like size, steel, or durability) that means the most to you, and save the custom-made, hand-forged blade for another year.And if what you want is a relatively inexpensive knife you can start using today, no research required, we recommend the Western-style 8-inch Victorinox Fibro Pro Chef\u2019s Knife. For a Japanese knife, try the 21-cm Tojiro DP Gyutou.Photo by Emma Fishman8-Inch Chef's Knife$47 at AmazonPhoto by Emma FishmanTojiro 21-cm (8.2\") DP Gyutou$85 at AmazonWhat kind of steel do I want?Avoid carbon steel\u2014which requires a ton of care!\u2014and go for stainless steel. Remember, though: Stainless doesn\u2019t mean it will never stain. Every time you use your knives, clean and dry them. This prevents rusting and corrosion.Illustration by Tim LahanWithin the family of stainless steels, consider the steel formula. Because stainless steel is an alloy (i.e., a mix of metals), its exact make-up will vary among knives. A good rule of thumb: If the manufacturer doesn\u2019t advertise what steel they\u2019re using (sometimes it\u2019s etched right into the blade), they\u2019re not proud of it.At the very least, look for (or inquire about) the words \u201chigh carbon\u201d (confusingly, that's different from carbon steel). High carbon is an indication that the knife will be hard and sharp.What is its Rockwell Scale rating?Illustration by Tim LahanIn general, the harder your knife, the sharper it can get; ask about its Rockwell Scale rating before buying\u2014according to Chad Ward, author of An Edge in the Kitchen, anything above 56 will hold its edge without dulling too quickly (and Japanese-style knives tend to be 60+).How long should my knife be?Blade length is a personal choice\u2014many people opt for an 8\" chef\u2019s knife, but it's not the only option! A longer model is useful for tackling hefty vegetables (hello, squash) and cuts of meat. If you\u2019re intimidated by large knives (or you\u2019ve got a shoebox-sized kitchen or tiny hands), consider a santoku, a Japanese knife that\u2019s usually no longer than 7\", with a flat cutting edge.What about the width?Chef\u2019s knives with wide blades are ideal for smashing (ginger, garlic, lemongrass, spices), scooping up piles of chopped stuff, and cutting through tall ingredients like melon, cabbage, and a standing roast. If you don\u2019t also own a paring or petty knife, though, a thinner blade might be a better choice: it\u2019s easier to maneuver when coring tomatoes, pitting peaches, or slicing raw fish.More essential reading:The Best Chef\u2019s Knife, According to BA EditorsThere\u2019s no one perfect knife\u2014but we\u2019ll help you find the best one for you.View StoryExplore Bon App\u00e9titKnivesRecipes you want to make.
