They descend on a Vietnamese feast prepared by a local mother-daughter duo: colorful spring rolls, garlic-fried tofu, nuoc cham, pickled veggies.In past weeks, they\u2019ve eaten a Mexican immigrant\u2019s local tamales; succulent Nepalese momos prepared by a native of Kathmandu; and curries and sambal made with love by an Indonesian transplant. They\u2019ve drank the famed pinot noir of Merry Edwards, one of California\u2019s first female winemakers.Women\u2019s clubs abound in 2018\u2014New York has The Wing and San Francisco The Assembly, The Hivery, and others\u2014but none so intentionally celebrate womanhood through the cuisines and cultures of their city as The Ruby. Founder Rachel Khong says The Ruby is far more than a coworking space. The food and beverage program is a way to help women \u201cvote with their forks and wallets,\u201d she says.

Reem Assil, whose Oakland bakery and restaurant are channels for both activism and Palestinian-Syrian cuisine, was a recent guest chef. Another week, Siska Marcus, who runs an Indonesian supper club in San Francisco, answered members\u2019 questions about Indonesian food over beef rendang, shrimp curry (made with shrimp paste that she ferments herself with local baby shrimp) and gado gado, a blanched-vegetable salad dressed in roasted peanut sauce.Growing up in Jakarta, Marcus was unofficial sous chef for her caterer-mother, but she moved to San Francisco to study a different craft: journalism. Later, feeling stifled by the confines of a 9-to-5 job, she returned to her roots and started hosting pop-up dinners out of her home. She now runs Chilicali, her supper club, and produces a line of jarred Indonesian sauces out of a commercial kitchen two blocks from The Ruby. Her food is personal, celebrating the spices and dishes of an underrepresented cuisine in the Bay Area.After Marcus\u2019 first lunch at The Ruby, members started following her on social media. Then, they came to her dinners. And again, and again.\u201cWe became friends and family almost,\u201d she said. \u201cI think when women are empowering each other it\u2019s just a beautiful thing.\u201dFor Marcus\u2014a small business owner with no marketing budget, trying to move from a pop-up to a food truck or a potential brick-and-mortar\u2014this support is invaluable.\u201cPeople don't get why we as females need that type of place, but the support, the camaraderie, the sisterhood,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cBut that\u2019s what we need, especially for small businesses like me.\u201dThis is Khong\u2019s vision in action: to have an impact beyond the walls and members of The Ruby.\u201cIt's a thing that we say a lot, that we should be spending money on the sorts of businesses that we want to support and to create the world we want to live in,\u201d Khong said. \u201cPeople can be very well-intentioned and still not really have the time to seek out a woman-made wine or even a woman-run lunch spot.\u201dKhong, soft-spoken and food-obsessed, started The Ruby after leaving her job as an editor at Lucky Peach shortly before her first novel, Goodbye Vitamin, was published. She felt disheartened by the lonely nature of freelancing and the rate at which she saw artists, writers, and chefs being priced out of a rapidly gentrifying city overrun with tech companies and homogenous food catering to them.The Ruby seeks to remind us that San Francisco is still colorful, offbeat and rich with food and people of all kinds. Many of the club\u2019s 130 members\u2014self-described \u201cRubies\u201d\u2014are creative Bay Area women of all definitions, including transgender and nonbinary individuals. Many have become ardent supporters and customers of the chefs and food businesses who\u2019ve come to the space.On Friday evenings, there\u2019s a weekly happy hour, always featuring a women-made wine, beer, or liquor, like Stevie Stacionis of community-focused Oakland wine shop Bay Grape. Recently she brought in three female-produced wines from around the world (California, France and Argentina) and talked Wine 101 with curious members.Stacionis feels at home at the gritty, open-minded co-working space, where vulnerable conversations about race, politics, literature and motherhood take place over spritzes and noodles. She feels a particular kinship with Khong, another woman building something she loves from the ground up.The spirit of The Ruby, in Stacionis\u2019s words? \u201cI\u2019m a woman trying to get shit done.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSan FranciscoTrendsRead MoreWhere to eatWhat\u2019s for Lunch at N.Y.C.\u2019s First Women-Only Coworking SpaceBy Christine MuhlkeRecipes you want to make.
