No, I am not good at opening wine bottles, and this is my truth.By Tiffany HopkinsAugust 31, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Isa ZapataFacebookTwitterEmailAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

With my days as a server behind me (and no one to fire me for saying this out loud), I\u2019m completely comfortable admitting that I was really good at down-selling wine. \u201cEh, are you sure you want that $120 bottle? How about a bright and zesty $8 glass of Pinot Grigio?\u201d That\u2019s because I sucked at opening wine. The anxiety of wondering whether I\u2019d break the cork while struggling with my waiter\u2019s corkscrew haunted me, and every time a party of five sat down to order, I prayed they\u2019d want cocktails instead.My colleagues have told you that a wine key\u2014that double-hinged corkscrew that other servers wield with ease and aplomb\u2014is the only wine opener you\u2019ll ever need. But in my opinion, the best way to uncork a bottle of wine is the way that doesn\u2019t make you break out into a cold sweat. Today, I\u2019m the proud owner of a Secura electric wine opener, and I open wine bottles with grace every single time. No twisting. No pushing. No pulling. I just press a button and the cork lifts out of the bottle seamlessly. It even comes with a separate foil cutter, so I don\u2019t have to fuss with that tiny little pop-out blade on a corkscrew. I\u2019ll admit that my Secura is initially met with skepticism and jokes, but as soon as my guests witness it at work\u2014such speed! such luxury!\u2014they are quickly converted.Secura Electric Wine Opener$30 at AmazonMy electric wine opener has a sleek stainless-steel finish that matches all of my other kitchen equipment, but you can find it in a variety of colors, like matte black and champagne gold. When it\u2019s not in use, store it on its charging base, which is small enough to leave out on the counter. Did I mention the LED light that turns on while the wine opener is in use? Mine lights up in fluorescent blue. Does your waiter\u2019s corkscrew come with a built-in Vegas-style light show?I still have a double-hinged corkscrew in my kitchen, because my boyfriend finds difficulty appealing (men, amirite?)\u2014but I will never use one again. For me, drinking a glass of wine symbolizes relaxation and ease, while the very thought of opening a bottle of wine summons flashbacks of freaking out behind the bar at my last restaurant job. If you, like me, love wine, but hate opening wine bottles, this electric corkscrew will let you have your wine and drink it too.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make.
