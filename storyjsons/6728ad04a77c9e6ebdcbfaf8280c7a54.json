Uh Oh, You\u2019ve Got Squash Hands'Tis the damn season.By Ali FrancisNovember 12, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailAs holiday season approaches, the BA Slack channels are popping off with squash content. What\u2019s the best peeler? Butternut squash soup or baked pasta on a cold night? Can you eat the skin? (It depends!) Then outta left field comes this question from senior cooking editor Sarah Jampel: \u201cHow does everyone feel about eating raw butternut squash?\u201d\u201cBig no for me because I get that weird contact dermatitis that some people get with raw squash,\u201d wrote assistant print editor Chala Tyson Tshitundu. \u201cIf I\u2019m not wearing gloves when I slice it, my hands get all tight and red and crackly.\u201d\u201cSQUASH HANDS!\u201d replied Jampel. \u201cI am similarly afflicted.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a curse! I just wanna love you, squash!\u201d Tyson Tshitundu commiserated.Meanwhile, the rest of us were all: \ud83e\udd28 \ud83c\udf83Apparently, Jampel and Tyson Tshitundu aren\u2019t the only ones burdened with this butternut squash skin reaction. A quick Google search reveals many people experience the sensation known as squash hands: When peeling, cutting, or handling raw chunks of it, they\u2019re left with a sticky-but-stiff orange-ish film that\u2019s difficult to remove; physically irritating, particularly to the soft skin on the palms; and a major buzzkill. With all those winter butternut recipes on the line\u2014creamy mac and cheese, coconutty muffins, and pretty tarts\u2014we simply had to get the skinny on this strange phenomenon.So, what is this butternut squash skin reaction all about?A 1994 study titled \u201cButternut squash (Cucurbita moschata) dermatitis\u201d by Thomas Potter and Ken Hashimoto describes a \u201c30-year-old female\u201d with no history of hand dermatitis who, \u201cwithin minutes of peeling and cutting up\u201d uncooked butternut squash, experiences a \u201cblistering eruption on the palms of her hands.\u201d Six weeks later she repeats the process and the hives return. In both cases a topical steroid cleared up the inflammation within a day or so.The first time Tyson Tshitundu experienced squash hands was last fall, while they were slicing up a bunch of raw butternut and honeynut squash to make soup. \u201cI noticed that my palms started feeling tight,\u201d they tell me. \u201cI thought maybe the squash [sap] had dried on my hands. But after washing them the issue persisted and I was so freaked out I truly thought I was going to have to amputate.\u201d A few supportive Reddit threads later and Tyson Tshitundu was \u201coff the ledge.\u201dWhat causes butternut squash dermatitis?While no precise culprit has been named as the catalyst for squash hands, Morgan Rabach, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist at LM Medical in NYC, says there is an unidentified allergen present in squash\u2014and other members of the Cucurbitaceae family, including pumpkins, acorn squash, cucumbers, melons, chayote, and zucchini\u2014that can result in a kind of contact dermatitis. Essentially: Some mystery compound found in these fruits \u201cirritates the skin to trigger an allergic reaction,\u201d she says.What are the symptoms of butternut squash dermatitis?As with most allergic reactions, the symptoms vary. For Tyson Tshitundu, squash hands manifest as \u201csuper tight, itchy palms that get hot and scaly\u201d that ease within 30 minutes or so. Others may feel \u201ctingly hands or \u2018burning\u2019 skin after touching squash,\u201d Rabach adds. In the most severe cases, where blistering of the skin occurs, scarring or some skin discoloration could linger after the reaction has passed. Either way, squash hands will \u201ceventually clear up on their own,\u201d Rabach says.The other good news is that, unlike a food allergy, squash hands only affects the skin. \u201cThe skin reaction does not mean you will get an allergic reaction if you eat squash,\u201d Rabach confirms. (Read: You can still go to town on those seared butternut squash steaks, even if you\u2019d rather not touch them raw.)Okay, this is me. What can I do to avoid a butternut squash skin reaction?Abstinence is obviously the most effective way to avoid \u2018squash hands.\u2019 But if you (understandably) cannot NOT make that creamy soup, you\u2019ve got three options:Wear gloves: Using food-safe latex gloves while chopping and peeling butternut squash (and its cronies) creates a barrier between your hands and the offending sap-like liquid that seeps out.Buy pre-cut squash: I know those expensive little tubs filled with pale orange cubes look sad and flaccid, but they\u2019ll save you the irritation.Outsource the task: \u201cHey, babe\u2026\u201dToo late! I\u2019m currently experiencing squash hands. What should I do?If your symptoms are mild, the reaction will likely clear up its own. If it\u2019s uncomfortable or severe, you\u2019ll probably want to:Use a topical steroid: If you are having an intense reaction, Rabach says these doctor-prescribed lotions are the fastest route \u201cto reduce itching, inflammation, and burning\u201d caused by squash hands.Take an antihistamine: Over-the-counter medications like Zyrtec or Allegra could also relieve symptoms, according to Rabach.Time to glove up:1 / 35ChevronChevronButternut Squash Steaks with Brown Butter-Sage SauceView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
