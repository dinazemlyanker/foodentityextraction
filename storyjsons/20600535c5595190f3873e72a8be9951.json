At home it\u2019s usually eaten with other Chinese New Year dishes over white rice. But it\u2019s also a great topping for noodles, lettuce, tortillas, and buns.\u201d Read more about Chinese New Year and find the full menu here.Ingredients8 servings2\u00bdlb. skin-on, boneless pork belly, cut into 1\" pieces\u00bccup sugar4scallions, white and pale green parts coarsely chopped, dark green parts thinly sliced12\" piece ginger, peeled, thinly sliced2garlic cloves, crushed1star anise pod\u00bccup light soy sauce\u00bccup Shaoxing wine (Chinese rice wine)Cooked short-grain rice (for serving)PreparationStep 1Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add pork and cook, skimming off foam from surface, 5 minutes (this blanching step gets rid of any impurities on the pork, making it more tender; don't skip this step!). Transfer pork to paper towels to drain.Step 2Wipe out pot. Heat 3 Tbsp. water in pot over medium-high. Add sugar, stir to dissolve, and cook, stirring constantly, until syrup thickens and turns a pale amber color, about 4 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and return pork to pot, swirling so all sides are covered in caramel. Add white and pale green parts of scallions, ginger, garlic, and star anise. Cook, tossing, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add soy sauce and wine and cook, stirring, until slightly reduced, about 1 minute.Step 3Pour in 3 cups water (it should just barely cover pork; add more if needed). Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and cook, partially covered and stirring occasionally, until pork is tender, 50\u201360 minutes.Step 4Using a slotted spoon, transfer pork to a plate; remove pot from heat. Let sauce cooking liquid cool slightly so rendered fat can rise to the surface. Using a ladle, skim off as much fat as possible (save it for another use).Step 5Return pot to medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is slightly thickened and glossy, 12\u201315 minutes. Return pork to pot and toss to gently reheat and coat with sauce.Step 6Transfer pork to a platter. Pour sauce over. Top with dark green scallion parts and serve with rice alongside.How would you rate Red-Braised Pork Belly (Hong Shao Rou)?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (4)Back to TopTriangleAbsolutely delicious, and taste like proper Chinese food! 10/10 would recommend to friends and family and would definitely make again.\nSource: am ChineseAnonymous8/26/2020I was looking for an easy way to make Chinese-style braised pork and stumbled upon this recipe. I managed to cut the cooking time by using a pressure cooker, but the results were delicious: meltingly tender pork chunks evenly coated with a sweet and savory sauce. Gorgeous on rice, and I'm planning to use the leftovers to make steamed pork buns.margamanlapigManila, Philippines4/20/2020This recipe was spot on. Simmering the pork beforehand and then letting everything meld together really seals in the flavor. The pork is melt in your mouth tender and just sweet enough without being overpowering. Reccomend serving with marble tea eggs and bok choyBellyboySeattle, WA5/5/2018I followed this recipe almost exactly. I used Chinese rock sugar. That was NOT a better alternative. It took too long to melt. I forgot the star anise, but it didn't matter. The pork was still tough after 50 minutes of simmering and I suspect the 3 cups of water washed out all the flavor. This was pork I had purchased from the butcher and cooked the same day- so the texture wasn't due to inferior meat. I also let the remaining liquid boil down far longer than the recipe called for, until there was almost a third of the liquid left, but it never really reached glazing consistency. J.
