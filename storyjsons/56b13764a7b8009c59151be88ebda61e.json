When something\u2019s so easy to make that you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.Watching my grandma cook Angolan food is the closest I\u2019ll ever get to magic. She doesn\u2019t believe in kitchen scales or own any fancy cookbooks, and she pretty much eyeballs every meal to perfection. As a kitchen equipment fanatic (everything is necessary), it boggles my mind. The ancestral knowledge and skills passed on through generations guide her to enhance everyday ingredients into outrageously moreish treats like kitaba.Kitaba or quitaba is a versatile roasted peanut paste that can be eaten on its own as a snack or mixed with water to form the base for other traditional Angolan dishes like muamba de ginguba, a flavor-packed peanut and chicken stew with okra. Kitaba is fragrant, spicy, salty, and nutty with sweet undertones. For years, my family and I only ate it at grandma\u2019s house because\u2014cue my terrible excuse for our sheer laziness\u2014she\u2019s just the best at it.When I first started cooking for myself, I hid from Angolan cuisine. Although I was always curious, it seemed so beyond my skill set that I didn\u2019t know where to start. Food is the strongest connection that I have to my heritage, so risk messing it up? I think not.It wasn\u2019t until lockdown, when I joined the circus of Instagram sourdough-bakers-in-training, that I wondered why I wasn\u2019t investing my time in learning about the foods perfected by my ancestors. They definitely heard me because that week, my grandma slipped a surprise through our letterbox. It was kitaba, but more than that, it was the love and comfort we had been craving in isolation. We all shrieked, and before inhaling it at record-breaking speed, I looked at it and knew it was my gateway to rediscovering my cultural identity.Unlike my grandma, I got out the scale and started perfecting my own kitaba. Peanuts are a major player in Angolan cuisine, and back home we have them in abundance, so it felt like the perfect ingredient to start my journey. Kitaba was the first of many dishes I learned to make, opening up an unquenchable thirst for self-discovery. Learning how to cook Angolan food has increased my appreciation for not just my grandma\u2019s cooking, but all those who came before me too. Plus, it\u2019s just fantastic.To make it, you\u2019ll start by roasting 350 grams (2\u2153 cups) raw redskin peanuts (these are ideal, but you can also give it a go with other raw peanuts with skins) on a baking sheet in a 350\u00b0 F (180\u00b0 C) oven for about 13\u201315 minutes. Make sure your peanuts have room to breathe and aren\u2019t cramped or they won\u2019t roast evenly. You\u2019ll know they\u2019re done when you\u2019re hypnotized by the smell and the skins darken to a gorgeous maroon. If, like me, you\u2019ve discovered the wonder that is air-frying (when I said everything is necessary, I meant it), you can also pop them in there for about 9\u201310 minutes\u2014just don\u2019t forget to give them a shake halfway.Let them cool completely. If you try the next step while they\u2019re warm, the peanuts will release too much oil and you\u2019ll end up with a sticky, liquid-y mess. Now, I love fumbling with peanut skins as much as anyone, but keep them on\u2014they\u2019ll help get you the rich flavor that makes kitaba so fabulous. Next, put the peanuts in a high-powered blender or food processor with \u00bd tsp. Maldon sea salt flakes (that\u2019s my favorite, but you can use any sea salt and tweak the amount to your taste) and \u00bd medium Scotch bonnet or \u2153 medium habanero pepper (add a little more, less, or none at all depending on your spice tolerance).Now, my grandma beats the ingredients together into a thick paste in a mortar and pestle, but as my biceps aren\u2019t quite there (yet), I blend them on the highest speed for 4\u20135 minutes. It should be very thick with a dough-like consistency. While it won\u2019t be crunchy, you should see fine, almost powdery bits of peanuts. Just like that, you\u2019ve got your kitaba and you can begin rapid consumption.To store it, I use a rolling pin or my hands to mold it into a rectangle (I go for 1-inch thickness, but freestyle as you wish) on a sheet of plastic wrap or parchment paper. I\u2019ll then score it into smaller squares so that it looks a bit like a chocolate bar, lift the plastic wrap/parchment paper into a container, and pop it in the fridge (it keeps for up to one month for those with self-control, or a day in my house).Kitaba is the ultimate movie companion or the high-protein, heart-healthy boost I need before a workout. Spoon it, spread it, slip it into a smoothie or sauce\u2014the choice is yours. Kitaba can do it all. Once you try kitaba, there\u2019s no going back to store-bought peanut butter.Jessica Alves is a London-based freelance food writer and social media marketer who thinks everything tastes better with chile.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimpleRecipes you want to make.
