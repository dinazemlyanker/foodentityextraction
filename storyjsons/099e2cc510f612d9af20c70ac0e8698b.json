Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,I don\u2019t need to tell you it\u2019s an intense time. Between the churn of virus-related news, the unsettlingly warm weather in NYC, and a bunch of uncertainty and malaise around the presidential election, the ambient stress out there is REAL. So far, my preparedness plan has involved the following: stress-eating beans, binge-watching Love Is Blind and hating myself for it, researching healthy meal-prep recipes, and taking my temperature at random intervals throughout the day (97.9, in case you were curious). I\u2019ve also been asking my Tinder matches what they\u2019re doing to stay vigilant. Best answer so far: \u201cI use Crisco instead of Purell. It\u2019s a personal choice.\u201dSpeaking of which, Buzzfeed reports that Tinder usage is up, but based purely on, um, anecdotal evidence, I think it\u2019s because people are sending flirty messages in lieu of meeting IRL. (Did anyone else not know about the \u201cvirus\u201d emoji until now?). On the plus side, \u201csocial distancing\u201d seems to be just the excuse my generation has been waiting for to cancel all our plans.The entire BA staff trying to figure out how to do a Zoom meeting.\nAnyway, here is a short list of stuff that\u2019s making me happy\u2014or at least distracted\u2014right now. It was a good relaxation exercise, putting this together. I hope it helps you too.HEALTHYISH FRIED CHICKEN. In case this week\u2019s new Healthyish recipe got lost in your feed, let me remind you: Sohla El-Waylly developed a gluten-free fried chicken recipe that\u2019s hot, sweet, and impossibly crunchy. Also, for some BTS intel, I can attest that she nailed this recipe on pretty much the first go-round. Sohla, we salute you.Andy Baraghani made one of my favorite Healthyish recipes on From the Test Kitchen this week. Go for the brothy pasta, stay for the Winona Ryder stanning.I don\u2019t think Sarah Jampel planned for The Basically Guide to Better Baking to happen at a time when people across the country are stuck in their apartments but,well, here we are, making Camo Chocolate Fudge Brownies and chit-chatting in the forum. Special shout out to reader MCC who\u2019s planning to \u201c~St. Paddy\u2019s-ize~\u201d that brownie recipe with Guinness and whiskey.Astrologer Chani Nichols read Lily Tomlin\u2019s and Jane Fonda\u2019s star charts and it\u2019s my favorite thing on the internet right now.International Womxn\u2019s Day was last Sunday, and I got to see Abena Boamah, founder of Hanahana Beauty, lead a conversation with four other amazing POC entrepreneurs at One Sunday at a Time, a Brooklyn boutique that I\u2019m now obsessed with. Naj Austin, who founded the social and wellness space Ethel\u2019s Club for people of color, talked about how \u201cdiversity and inclusion\u201d is not the same as \u201cequity and stakeholdership,\u201d and I\u2019ve been thinking about that a lot since then.Cabbage. It\u2019s making me very happy. First I thought it was just an Andy thing: He developed the Caramelized Cabbage for Healthyish, the Stuffed Cabbage with Lemony Rice in the March issue, and a Cheesy Cabbage Gratin back in the fall. (How\u2019d we let him get away with all that?). But there\u2019s also the cabbage-heavy menu at NYC\u2019s latest hotspot Veronika, the wood-fired cabbage with salsa verde I had at Reveler\u2019s Hour in DC a couple weeks ago, and Start Simple author Lukas Volger\u2019s recent \u201cSoup!\u201d Instagram Story starring a white bean and cabbage soup I can\u2019t wait to make. I gotta hand it to Jaya Saxena, who called it back in December: Cabbage is our new current vegetable crush.Here is an incredibly soothing GIF of cake.Reminder: We\u2019re all in this together.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish editorP.S. If an important part of your wellness routine (your therapy sessions, your support groups, your access to medications or other care) has been affected by coronavirus, I\u2019m curious to know about it.
