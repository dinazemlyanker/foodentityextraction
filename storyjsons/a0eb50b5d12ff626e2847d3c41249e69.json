The key to perfect shrimp is steeping them in hot water, rather than boiling them, which ensures that they\u2019re tender and juicy every time. And while this dill-cream sauce\u2014inspired by my mom\u2019s Seattle Junior League cookbook\u2014is a sure winner, these sprightly shrimp will shine no matter how you want to dress them up. \u2014Ned Baldwin, Houseman, NYC\u00a0This recipe is part of Short Is Sweet, our collection of summer dishes that deliver a whole lot of deliciousness in 30 minutes or less.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Carol YBoise, ID11/2/2021Fresh and fast! The first time, I followed the recipe exactly. It was fabulous and both of our guests asked for the recipe.  The second time, I thawed frozen shrimp, and really, I will do that in the future when not making this for guests.  Combining the simple dressing. ingredients the days before really helped blend the flavors.Home CookSt. Paul, MN8/7/2021I thought this was simple and delicious. Since there are so few ingredients, don\u2019t skip on quality. We threw in some halved cherry tomatoes and a little extra lemon juice. Perfect for nights you don\u2019t feel like cooking, and thawed raw frozen shrimp worked great.SarahTakoma Park, MD7/8/2021I agree that this was meh. We added a sprinkling of Tobacco sauce which improved it. However,this was really fast and easy. Big plus. Would love to hear how others improved on the recipe as written. Marilyn 6/26/2021@Donna G. and anyone else who finds the wording confusing - the lemon itself is what is being halved and divided (after the zest is removed from the whole thing), not the zest.AnonymousPhiladelphia6/22/2021what is table spoon of diamond crystal?\nDO you use fresh shrimps or frozen ?\nMine always turn out rubbery\nhavent tried recipe yet wait your answersSArah TrustNew Zealand6/21/2021Remarkably tasty, remarkably easy AnonymousPalm Harbor, FL6/20/2021Its a good way to cook shrimp.and the fresh dill is excellent in the cream.sauceGillianToronto Canada6/20/2021the recipe never mentions what to do with the other half of the lemon zest. I think I'll sliver it and add it to the cream sauce.Donna GNew York6/6/2021Good technique, I use to cook shelled, deveined shrimp 1-1/2 minutes.\n\nAlthough recipes calls for deveined shrimps as should always be, the photo attached, shrimps are undeveined. \ud83d\ude1cGina RamosNORTHERN VA6/6/2021This looked and sounded like the bomb and yet we found it lacking something.  Maybe some things.  So, you can't go wrong with all these ingredients; I mean, just look!  The boil for the shrimp did impart a nice tang to them.  But on the plate we realized the dill alone couldn't elevate this much above a \"meh.\"  So what does it need?  I'd say some degree of onion.  Maybe some wee tomatoes.  Some kind of acidity--you pick your source.  Your favorite vinegar in the cream sauce?  Anyway we thought it was bland although you can't not like a bunch of creamy shrimp.  If we make it again it'll include a significant amount of je ne sais quoi.  PaulTexas6/5/2021perfect summer lunch.
