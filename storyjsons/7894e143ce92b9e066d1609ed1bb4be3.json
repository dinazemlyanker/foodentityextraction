Room temperature cream cheese is key for this recipe\u2014if it\u2019s too cold, it won\u2019t blend smoothly with the sour cream. Kimchi varieties and brands vary greatly in terms of heat level and flavor profile, so choose your own adventure.

ClairePennsylvania2/5/2022This recipe deserves more stars! It's very good. For those who struggled with the liquid, try squeezing the kimchi fully. Anyway, so so good. It was a hit at a NYE party I attended several years back, and at the holiday party I threw right before the pandemic began. I'm going to make it again, because truly, I've been thinking about it since.Martha12/13/2021I've not tried this yet, however it has the essentials for flavorful dish indeed.  I look forward to it.  On a side note, as I came to this site seeking different recipes for kimchi and I've not been disappointed.  I have a variation of this wherein it's not so much a dip, rather a spread.:\n8 ozs. kimchi drained and dried.  (ALWAYS open jarred kimchi over a sink because it's constantly fermenting while sealed), chopped/diced small\n8 ozs. of Shredded Sharp Cheddar Cheese\n8 ozs. of Shredded Monterey Jack\n16 ozs. Whipped Cream Cheese\nSeasonings to taste.... (use your imagination)\n\nBlend or mix thoroughly and refrigerate at least two hours, if not overnight.  (It will last well if sealed in the frig for a 7-10 days.\nUse as a spread for grilled cheese OR..... make a kimchi/spread quesadilla and add any protein (or not) you want.\n\nEnjoy and thanks for the dip recipe.\nROBINTHEUSAFL, USA4/23/2021A very nice recipe \u2014 I stepped up the Korea flavour factor by adding 1 tsp of sesame oil, a sprinkle of chopped green onions, and some toasted sesame seeds to take it to the next level. Anonymous12/31/2020This was good. I used the food processor to make life easier. Used 4% skyr since we didn\u2019t have sour cream, and less soy sauce (~1 tsp) since I didn\u2019t have low sodium. Really tasty as a burger condiment and to dip veggies in. The kimchi does all the work (flavor wise) for you.Anonymous6/21/2020Refrigerator cleanout becomes a fantastic dip. Refreshing and tangy, benefiting from the brightness of the three main ingredients, with a bit of umami and spice coming through from the kim chi and soy sauce. It reminds me somehow of a very retro shrimp dip my parents made in the early 1980s for their parties, bringing a nostalgic hit to an already delicious new recipe. (The flavor profile comparison makes sense - that throwback memory was a sour cream, canned cocktail shrimp, chili sauce concoction.) \nThis kim chi dip is definitely something we'll be adding to our own entertaining!Jena DiPintoNashua, NH8/24/2019Refrigerator cleanout becomes a fantastic dip.

Didn't taste nice!mgxkleinFrance2/6/2019Sorry but this was vile tasting.
