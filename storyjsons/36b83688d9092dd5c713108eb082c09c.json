You\u2019ll need to clear some space in your refrigerator and get organized at least a week before you plan to eat it. Curing the meat takes about five days and is a crucial first step\u2014corned beef is named for the large grains or \u201ccorns\u201d of salt that were traditionally used in the curing process. We opt for a small amount of pink curing salt, which gives the interior of the cooked beef an appetizing rosy hue. A host of pickling spices go into our curing mix, too, plus a can of Guinness, which adds some richness and a refreshing touch of bitterness. If necessary, a gluten- or alcohol-free beer can stand in for the Irish stout.After curing, you'll simmer the corned beef brisket with more of that spice mixture for about 45 minutes per pound. Serve it on St. Patrick\u2019s Day with halved or quartered red-skinned potatoes, wedges of green cabbage, and large chunks of carrot (just drop the veg into the cooking liquid about 40 minutes before the beef is done) for what\u2019s known in New England as a Boiled Dinner. For more guidance, check out this video.If you have leftovers and aren\u2019t feeling like a sandwich on rye or a classic corned beef hash, try chopping the meat and using it in egg rolls (it works surprisingly well!) or drape slices atop a Reuben sandwich\u2013inspired Dutch baby (simply swap the pastrami for the corned beef).Editor\u2019s note: This recipe was originally published March 14, 2017.Ingredients6\u20138 servingsPickling Spice5dried chiles de \u00e1rbol11-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled, coarsely chopped13-inch cinnamon stick10cardamom pods8dried bay leaves3tablespoons whole peppercorns2tablespoons coriander seeds2tablespoons mustard seeds1tablespoon allspice berries1tablespoon juniper berries1teaspoon whole clovesBrine and Brisket114.9-ounce can Guinness draught\u00bdcup (packed) light brown sugar5teaspoons pink curing salt2\u00bdcups kosher salt, plus more15\u20136 pound untrimmed flat-cut beef brisketPreparationPickling SpiceStep 1Toast chiles, ginger, cinnamon stick, cardamom, bay leaves, peppercorns, coriander seeds, mustard seeds, allspice berries, juniper berries, and cloves in a large dry skillet over medium heat, shaking pan occasionally, until spices start to jump in pan and are fragrant, 3\u20135 minutes (don\u2019t let them burn). Transfer to a mortar and pestle and coarsely crush about 1 minute (or crush with a knife).Brine and BrisketStep 2Whisk Guinness, brown sugar, curing salt, 2\u00bd cups kosher salt, and 1 gallon water in a large pot or container (at least 8 quarts) until sugar and salts are dissolved. Scoop out \u00bd cup pickling spice and set aside in a small bowl or jar (you won\u2019t need it again until it\u2019s time to cook the corned beef). Add remaining spice mixture and brisket to brine and weigh down with a plate to keep it submerged (it\u2019s okay if brisket needs to be crammed into the container, just don\u2019t fold it; you can also cut it in half if you can\u2019t find a large enough container). Cover with plastic wrap or a lid and chill, flipping meat once a day, 5\u20136 days.Step 3Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a simmer. Remove brisket from brine and rinse thoroughly under cold water; discard brine. Add brisket to simmering water along with reserved \u00bd cup spice mixture and cook, covered, until corned beef is fork-tender and easily shreds with the grain, 4\u20134\u00bd hours.Step 4Slice corned beef against the grain and serve.Do Ahead: Corned beef can be cooked 1 week ahead; cover with plastic and chill.How would you rate Corned Beef ?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (14)Back to TopTriangleFor all the people that don't read the whole article:\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This recipe was originally published March 14, 2017.Ryan K.California3/16/2022The first thing you say is that you have to start a week ahead, but that means ready next Tuesday, days after St patrick's Day.  Not very sharp planning on this one, I'm afraid. \nPaigeChicago3/15/2022As has been mentioned, this recipe would have been ideal to have a week ago. All that being said I can\u2019t wait to try it as I make corned beef at least 5-6 times a year. ScottSan Juan Bautista, Ca3/15/2022You said you were not doing beef recipes. Are  you not woke anymore?Petenaples fl3/15/2022I had to chuckle as I read the reviews. Isn't this Corned Beef and Cabbage Dinner always this way? The Brisket might be too salty, the carrots too soft, same with the cabbage, the potatoes just right, and hopefully the Corned Beef not too stringy. And we eat it anyway and it's a great meal and traditionVicky OVershire, Vermont3/15/2022If this take a week why are you giving us the recipe 3 days before St Patrick\u2019s Day? Anonymous3/15/2022I\u2019m with Willie on wondering why you would suggest a recipe that is already too late to start?Mike3/14/2022Looks like a great recipe, but if it needs to be started a week before it\u2019s ready to eat, why are we hearing about it only 3 days before St. Paddy\u2019s day?Willie3/14/2022Pretty good! I had more like a 3.5/4lb brisket (cooked for a bit under 3h). It did turn out a bit saltier than I'd anticipated, and I second the recommendation to cook your cabbage separately. The EXTREMELY salty (by the end) boiling water makes for A+ potatoes, but too much (imho) for carrots, unless you cook them only very briefly. I spooned out a couple of ladle's worth of the boiling water into a separate pan, added twice that amount of water, and cooked my cabbage in that. Laura G.Los Angeles, CA11/17/2020On the bag of cure it says a tsp is good for 5 lbs.  I use .25 percent when doing jerky.  Im curious how much to use in a brine with a 9 or 10 lb brisket.  Shussey512High River, Alberta5/15/2020Wow.  This produced the best corned beef I\u2019ve ever had.  Had a timing issue and ended up brining for only one day but doing the 4.5 hour boil with a great result.   Used Boston Spice\u2019s \u201cSouthie\u201d blend of pickling spices, which are very similar to BA\u2019s recipe.  SO fragrant, bright, and delicious.  We are blown away.  Thanks BA!laura_birenbaNYC3/30/2020I would like to try this recipe.  After brining the brisket, any thoughts on cooking using the sous vide method, rather than boiling it?  Would it taste the same and have the same texture?prosecute1966Elgin, Illinois3/18/2019This was a delicious meal. We had a 6 lbs brisket which we brined for 5 days per the instructions. I simmered it for 4.5 hours and it was just a little over cooked on the thin edge but I should have payed closer attention. Added 2-3\u201d carrot pieces and quarter red potatoes 25 minutes before cooking finished and cooked the cabbage for 15 minutes while the meat rested. JWatIV13Rapid City, SD9/4/2018This was a fun recipe to try! The meat turned out nice and pink from the curing salt, and it was super tender and flavorful. I do think next time I would cook the cabbage separately since everything was so salty from being cooked in the same liquid.\n\nIf you make this, make sure you find curing salt ahead of time since I had a crazy hard time finding it. Spice House in Chicago finally saved me.soapnanaChicago4/9/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titIrishEuropeanBrisketBeefMeatMainDairy-FreeDinnerRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
