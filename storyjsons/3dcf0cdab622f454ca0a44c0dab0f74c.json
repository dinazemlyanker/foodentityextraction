For more than a decade, the practicing internist, culinary medicine teacher, travel blogger, and San Francisco Cooking School\u2013trained chef has been bridging the gap between food and medicine. In her new cookbook, Spicebox Kitchen, Shiue shows us how a stash of spices can act as the cook\u2019s equivalent to a doctor\u2019s bag.Her Taiwanese roots and love for travel yield pages of globally-inspired recipes, taking readers on a journey through California (where she lives), Asia, Trinidad (where her husband grew up), the Mediterranean, and the Middle East. From whole wheat scallion pancakes laced with Sichuan peppercorns to coconut-creamed callaloo, Shiue proves that eating healthy can, and should, be delicious.Of course, the healing potential of food and spices is nothing novel; this philosophy underpins the way many cultures have eaten for millenia, long before mass production lines left us with sugary cereals and over-processed ingredients. By highlighting dishes from around the world, Shiue\u2019s cookbook nudges us back to the origins of wellness. As she sees it, there are more definitions of nutritious eating than the modern health industry might have us believe. \u201cWe have to embrace what other cuisines bring to the table, literally,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is how we\u2019ll help everyone get well.\u201dJust before the Spicebox Kitchen launch, I called Shiue to chat about her journey from clinic to kitchen, what\u2019s missing from Western medicine, and why joy is an essential ingredient.I grew up surrounded by international visitors\u2026 in eastern Long Island near the major national laboratory where both my parents worked. We would have these potlucks at our house periodically where people from all over the world would make a dish they loved; those dinners really opened the world for me.I thought cooking had nothing to do with medicine\u2026 and that being a chef was a nice diversion from being a doctor. My practice was, I think, very similar to most doctors\u2019 practices in the Western world. I would see patients, figure out what their problem was, and then prescribe a pill. Unless you have a medical condition, insurance doesn\u2019t cover preventative treatment.My light bulb moment happened\u2026 at a Harvard Medical School conference in 2012. The event brought together chefs and doctors and dietitians to talk about the latest updates in nutrition science and how we could help our patients integrate them into cooking practices. I\u2019d often felt like I wasn\u2019t doing enough for my patients; that they weren\u2019t able to make the lifestyle changes they wanted to. In that moment I realized food could be a really great, creative way of guiding them towards healthier choices. I literally taught my first cooking class for patients a week after that, and have been doing so at my clinic since.I started writing recipes for my patients\u2026 on my prescription pad, which felt very radical. I would ask people what they\u2019re eating, where they got tripped up, and what they thought was their downfall. I thought, Okay, how can I take what they like and make it a little bit more nutritious? And so my first two recipes were for kale chips and banana and \u2018nice cream\u2019 (where you take frozen bananas and whip them up in a food processor or blender). Even with all the kind of highfalutin medical training I\u2019ve had, those recipes were what earned me the most passionate letters of gratitude from patients.Traditionally there\u2019s not really a negotiation about treatment\u2026 in a doctor\u2019s office. But that doesn\u2019t work for most people. I mean, people will maybe take the pills if you prescribe them, but you can\u2019t actually tell them what to do. With food, I found that I could give my patients more choices and agency to forge their own paths to health.The proliferation of processed food\u2026 in the \u201960s has maybe everything to do with why we\u2019ve moved away from the idea that food is medicine\u2014while plenty of other countries still acknowledge that. America has a diverse population, with many cultures that share that perspective, and while we love and eat their cuisines, the message didn't seem to translate.A major problem with how we eat in this country\u2026 is that there\u2019s kind of a monoculture around wellness in general. Like, I love kale and quinoa, but that\u2019s what people think you have to eat to be healthy. And if you come from a culture where that doesn\u2019t taste good to you, or it doesn\u2019t make sense to you, you might feel like, Well, I can\u2019t be healthy, then. My reason for featuring different parts of the world in my cookbook is that I wanted to give options that were more culturally inclusive.Spices were our first medicines\u2026 and they also add a lot of flavor. When making a curry, you also get the anti-inflammatory power of turmeric\u2014especially when combined with black pepper, which increases its bioavailability. When you cook with ginger, you're not only adding a flavor you might associate with Asian food, you\u2019re also getting digestive benefits.I don\u2019t want to be part of diet culture\u2026 in a weight loss way, and I think joy is an essential part of eating. My goal is really to get people to enjoy vegetables more, by making them super delicious. I just want to be about good health and enjoying your food.Spicebox Kitchen$32 $26 at Amazon$29 at Bookshop.orgExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSpiceTrinidadianAsianMiddle EasternMediterraneanCaliforniaShoppingInterviewsRecipes you want to make.
