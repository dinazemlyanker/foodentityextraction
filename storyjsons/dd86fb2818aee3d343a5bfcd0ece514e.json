He's used his global platform to address gay rights and body image issues, and, when we spoke to him just before the 2018 Winter Olympics, he told us about how he handles performance anxiety. Read on for his master strategy and how to employ it, whether you're stepping onto the ice rink, the stage, or your boss's office.Beyond the jumps and triple axels, a huge amount of athletic performance comes down to mental game. How you handle nerves\u2014from the cumulation of a lifetime of work or thoughts of the millions of people watching and commenting online\u2014is often what separates the medal winners from the rest of the pack. \u201cI know that, at twenty-eight, I\u2019m a lot tougher than I ever thought I was,\" says Adam Rippon. \"It\u2019s how you deal with the situations that\u2019s important.\u201dThe first part of Rippon's strategy is to see anxiety as a good thing. \u201cWhen I feel nerves, it\u2019s like I earned them,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve worked my whole life to be in the situation where I can be like, \u2018Oh my god, I\u2019m so nervous to compete at the Olympics.\u2019\" This works because, when you feel grateful for something, you're less likely to feel terrified. Nobody lucks into competing at the Olympics, or interviewing for a high-level job, or a million other important life events. Recognizing your journey helps reaffirm your confidence.The second part of Rippon's strategy is to re-direct his attention. \u201cI used to go out in competition and be like, \u2018The weight of world is on my shoulders,\u2019\" he says. But now, at 28, he looks beyond the ice. \u201cTo get a sense of reality and the things that actually matter in life, I\u2019ll go to my coaches and ask how their family is doing,\u201d says Rippon. \u201cIt reminds me that life is so much bigger than the arena I\u2019m in.\u201dBoth techniques are about gaining perspective, and Rippon isn't the only Olympian using this strategy. From silver medalist luger Chris Mazdzer , who visualizes going down the track in a series of \"mind runs,\" to hockey player Meghan Duggan, who journals her goals and intentions every morning, the Team USA roster is stacked with athletes hoping to destress by keeping perspective.Dr. Brent Walker, Columbia University\u2019s Associate Athletics Director for Championship Performance and former mental training consultant for the U.S. Soccer Paralympic soccer team, says Rippon's strategy is at the core of sports psychology. \u201cUsually, when we struggle, things get out of perspective,\u201d he says. And even people who aren't going for gold in Pyeongchang can put it to good use. Here are his five key tips for handling yourself in the most stressful situations.Do a \"validity check.\"Dr. Walker\u2019s favorite way to keep perspective involves assessing the situation as it unfolds. \u201cI call it a validity check: Are the thoughts you\u2019re having realistic?\u201d he says. \u201c I always ask athletes to consider the narrative that they\u2019re using in a situation. We have more than one voice in our head\u2014we have the voice of success and the voice of failure\u2014and part of being successful is listening to the voice of success.\u201dVisualize coping with pressure, not celebrating victory.\u201cPeople commonly think of visualization as imagining victory, but most people benefit more from visualizing ourselves in difficult situations and seeing ourselves coping with that effectively,\u201d says Walker. \u201cWhen we do that, we\u2019re essentially preparing for being calm and composed in the moment.\u201dGround yourself. Literally.\u201cWhen you get in the high-stress situation, it\u2019s all about using some mindfulness techniques,\u201d says Dr. Walker. \u201cA simple one is noticing how your feet feel on the ground and shifting your weight\u2014you essentially center yourself and bring your focus into the current moment.\u201dJust breatheBreathing exercises seem basic, but they\u2019re well known for a reason. Walker is a proponent of doing a basic four count (inhale and count to four, exhale and count to four) to combat anxiety. \u201cResearch has shown that breathing in and out on that four count will start to bring your heart rhythm back to one that\u2019s more synonymous with a lack of stress, and focusing on the breath brings you back to the present moment,\u201d he says.  In other words, measured breathing diminishes your body\u2019s physiological response to stress and tricks you into feeling calmer in the process.Start using these techniques early\u201cA lot of athletes imagine being at the Olympics on a daily basis, so they\u2019re used to being in that moment when it actually arrives,\u201d says Walker. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a time-travel approach, but I think that\u2019s what a lot of high-level athletes do\u2014they imagine themselves in the situation, and when they get there, they can put themselves back into the past.\u201d Anticipating a high-stress situation months out gives you time to prepare and adjust, so when the day of your big presentation arrives, you\u2019ll feel as natural as possible.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishOlympicsRead MoreLifestyleWhat 6 U.S. Athletes Are Eating for Breakfast at the 2018 Winter OlympicsBy Alyse WhitneyRecipes you want to make.
