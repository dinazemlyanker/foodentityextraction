Sharing became a thing I had to do, not something I ever wanted to do. I\u2019ve learned to live with it, and sometimes, maybe even enjoy it. At The Fly in Brooklyn, for instance, there are a bunch of things that are great to split: the perfectly seasoned rotisserie chicken, bottles of natural wine, the large U-shaped bar that takes up nearly the whole room. There is, however, one thing that is best enjoyed on your own. It\u2019s the chicken sandwich, and (surprise, surprise) it\u2019s my favorite thing on the menu.The whole thing is just small enough that you can hold it one-handed (that\u2019s one of my hands, not yours), which is important because I always have a chilled glass of wine in the other.The meat is pulled from last night\u2019s rotisserie chicken\u2014a combo of white and dark, plus the crispy, salty skin\u2014and topped with a bright and crunchy onion-radish-celery slaw, with a swipe of aioli spread across both ends of the Shewolf Bakery potato roll. It\u2019s compact, juicy, and satisfying. Left to my own devices, I\u2019ll eat the whole thing in three bites. Don\u2019t worry, though, I\u2019m happy to share my fries.Go there: The FlyExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsBrooklynRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
