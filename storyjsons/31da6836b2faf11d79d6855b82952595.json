It was my introduction to restaurants, period.By Bao OngApril 16, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Eliesa JohnsonFacebookTwitterEmailWelcome to Red Sauce America, our coast-to-coast celebration of old-school Italian-American restaurants.I never considered myself an emotional eater until I saw a dead body floating in the Mississippi River. Nearly a decade ago, as a junior reporter at what was then the St. Paul Pioneer Press, I watched as rescuers pulled up a missing sewer worker from the murky river that divides St. Paul and Minneapolis. There was no time to process the shock\u2014I was on the Saturday shift covering breaking news, and I had just a few hours to write a story about the tragedy for the next day\u2019s paper.So, naturally, I made a beeline for Cossetta, a local family-owned red sauce joint, and ordered the mostaccioli pasta, a hefty serving of penne oozing with cheese and marinara. It was the perfect dish and place for a reporter on deadline. The food was pure comfort. You weren\u2019t rushed out like you were at a deli, but you also didn\u2019t come to linger over a glass of Barolo. It felt like a homey cafeteria.But Cossetta (commonly referred to as Cossetta\u2019s, but as the fourth-generation owner Dave Cossetta once told me: \u201cIt\u2019s like Gucci, not Gucci\u2019s\u201d) was about so much more than the food for me. It was not only my introduction to Italian-American food, but also in a lot of ways my introduction to restaurants in general. Growing up in a family of six with first-generation immigrant parents, dining out was an extravagance, and the closest thing we got to Italian food was the occasional Totino\u2019s frozen pizza. I could only fantasize about some of the foods my friends ate with their families. Chef Boyardee. Pizza Hut. Hot Pockets. (The Italian-American culinary canon, as I understood it.)All homey cafeteria vibes here.\nPhoto by Eliesa JohnsonBut all that changed when, as a 15-year-old high school freshman, I stepped past the green awning into Cossetta. I went there with my English class after seeing a production of Rent. I\u2019ll never forget my first order of that mostaccioli, a plastic plate piled high with pasta tossed in a ricotta cream sauce and topped with a sausage-laced tomato sauce. I may have grown up eating rice with every home-cooked meal, but from that moment on, my pasta obsession never waned. I was hooked.For as long as I lived in St. Paul, Cossetta was where I commemorated milestone after milestone: signing the lease for my first apartment, turning in my senior thesis, breaking up with a boyfriend. After landing my job at the paper, where the newsroom was within walking distance, I ordered the mostaccioli at least once a week.My idea of Italian food is more expansive these days. I went to culinary school, I\u2019ve dined at all the hip \u201cregional Italian\u201d spots in New York over the past 10 years, and I\u2019ll happily throw down for the cacio e pepe of the moment. But I still find myself gravitating toward the iconic red sauce restaurants in Manhattan\u2019s Little Italy, places where I can pronounce Chianti \u201cchee-ANT-ee\u201d and scarf down a simple plate of carbs. Turns out, I\u2019m still craving the comfort and familiarity that Cossetta offered, after all these years.Bao Ong is the Food and Drink Editor of Time Out New York.
