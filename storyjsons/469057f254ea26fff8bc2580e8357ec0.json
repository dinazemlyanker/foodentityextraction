If you aren\u2019t up for making the chermoula, we won\u2019t judge if you use store-bought green hot sauce instead.

The chermoula is worth making - it adds some grassy, citrus zip to brighten up the plate. Lots of reviews suggesting it takes 2 hours - definitely possible with lots of veg prep but I think if you're a bit efficient with multitasking and ensure veggies (especially longer cooking ones like sweet potatoes) are chopped small enough, it can be done in just over an hour. Don't get disheartened! :)\n\nAJLondon, UK9/2/2021The flavors and textures were excellent. I used steel cut oats instead of farro to make it gluten free, and about half the oil that the chermoula called for and it came out lovely. It does take a long time; 2 hours is a good estimate (wish I'd read the other reviews before I started in on prepping)! AnonymousSacramento, CA12/14/2020We really enjoyed this but not for breakfast, for dinner. I made the chermoula and roasted the sweet potatoes in the morning, prepped everything else and when it came time for  dinner it all went together exactly as it was supposed to. The only thing I did differently was to crack the eggs right on top of the hash, put the lid on the pan and in a few minutes it was done. The chermoula was awesome, I could eat it on anything. Yum.pisces47Florida7/12/2020Excellent. The hash itself has a great combination of textures and the balance of sweet, savory and salty flavors is very pleasing. The chermoula is complex and complements the hash well. I maybe added a teaspoon too much lemon juice. So stick to 1 Tbsp. \n\nThis dish definitely took at least 2 hours to cook, but it made a lot of food and was definitely worth the effort. \n\nChanges - cooked the farro in chicken broth. Instead of 1 Tbsp of Thyme, did 1 Tsp thyme and 1 Tsp marjoram. Used sesame seeds. Can't find benne seeds in Texas.a.goekler7491Denton, TX7/8/2020First time trying farro and this was excellent! Lots of steps, but well worth it. If you want to save some time, make the sauce ahead of time.AnonymousCharlotte, NC5/30/2020Made the hash today (sans the chermoula) and it was so good. Delightful flavors and textures. My boyfriend and I ate a ton of it. (We also put a little Cholula on it for kicks and that was tasty too.) It took a long time to make, mostly because I'm a fairly new cook and still pretty slow, but honestly it was worth it. I'll be making it again in the near future.aliciamageeMaryland5/14/2020 This recipe was a hit with the whole family. It took two hours from start to finish so a bit lengthy for morning breakfast but it would be very easy to make each component the day before and reheat in the morning with fresh over easy eggs. In fact the leftover hash was just as good a couple of days later! I was a little concerned that the chermoula was very bitter when tasted by itself. However with the hash it was perfect. (Though it does make a lot - you could easily cut the chermoula ingredients in half.) I've already shared the recipe with friends and family and will make again!TXHuskerTexas5/5/2020We loved it! Such a nice balance of savory and healthy. We  don't have a pestle and mortar so we used ground spices instead and it still came out great. AnonymousBrooklyn, NY5/5/2020This was all right. It just came out tasting a little flat after everything that went into it. I just thinly sliced the entire brussel sprouts, cores and leaves together, because it seemed unecessarily fiddly to separate the leaves.AnonymousNew York5/3/2020This was delicious. A little time-consuming, so I took a few shortcuts: instead of toasting and grinding the spices for the chermoula, I just used pre-ground spices. I was short on parsley and cilantro and didn't have mint, so I added some dill to the chermoula that I had on hand. The combination of farro, sweet potatoes, and brussels sprouts, plus the herby chermoula, was fantastic. Anonymousnew haven, connecticut4/24/2020So, so good. I'll definitely be making this again for breakfast. I roasted the sweet potatoes for closer to 20 minutes, but that might just be a quirk with my oven. Realistically, the only way I deviated from the recipe was using a pestle and mortar instead of a blender to make the chermoula and it still turned out amazingly well. AnonymousVancouver, BC4/21/2020Subbed ~1/2t of smoked paprika for the bacon to make vegetarian, and accidentally-on-purpose let it go a little long after adding the farro to crisp it up. Absolutely delicious. Might increase the sprouts next time.AnonymousChicago4/21/2020This was super yummy and filling!! Highly recommend! But I did do a few things differently (cue groans). I didn't have brussels sprouts but I did have kale. I didn't have parsley or mint but I did have carrot greens. And then, I don't have a blender so I couldn't get the chermoula to exactly the right consistency in my food processor, and although it was tasty it was a little bitter for me (probably the carrot greens). So when I added the farro to the frying pan, I mixed the chermoula in and cooked it a little before putting in the sweet potato. Also, I didn't feel like I needed the oil in the pan because the bacon grease did the job by itself, but I was also only blanching kale rather than brussels sprouts so that might not work for everyone. The flavor profile here was awesome and the mix of textures is perfect! emonydaxwisconsin4/18/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titFarroRice & GrainsCilantroHerbs & SpicesParsleyBaconCured MeatMeatSweet PotatoPotatoVegetableEggBrussels SproutFallEasyMainNut-FreeDairy-FreeHealthyishSaut\u00e9BreakfastLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
