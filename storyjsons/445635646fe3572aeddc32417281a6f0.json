When something's so easy to make that you don't even need one. Welcome to It's That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.When my favorite farm stands are overflowing with ripe peak season fruit, it feels wrong to fuss with it too much. Yet even simple summer desserts often call for more tossing, crumbling, and baking than suits my taste. What I really want at the end of a meal is a sweet something that allows whatever\u2019s in season to shine, and this creamy dessert dip\u2014basically after-dinner crudit\u00e9s\u2014is almost always the answer.That\u2019s right: dessert dip! A bowl of rich, lightly sweetened dairy that makes a platter of perfect cherries, strawberries, sliced plums, or any other fruit feel like a proper treat. If you want to sound fancy, you can say something about how that chocolate-flecked concoction evokes stracciatella, arguably the best and simplest Italian gelato flavor. But if you want to be real about it, you can tell everyone that they\u2019re eating adult Dunkaroos. Either way it\u2019s probably the easiest, most crowd-pleasing warm-weather dessert anyone could possibly ask for.\u00a0Here\u2019s how to make it:In a medium bowl, combine 1 cup cold whipped cream, \u00bc cup good sour cream, 2 Tbsp. powdered sugar, and \u00bc tsp. salt. (I like to add 1 Tbsp. amaro, whiskey, or rum to the mix, but I\u2019m a great lover of boozy desserts\u2014totally optional.) Use an electric mixer or a whisk to beat it all together until soft peaks form. Then, take a 3\u00bd-ounce bar of dark chocolate, chop it finely, and gently fold it into the dip. That\u2019s it! Spoon it into a cute bowl, arrange some beautiful fruit around it, maybe some crunchy store-bought cookies or shortbreads for good measure, and you\u2019re all set for a lazy, lingering post-prandial hang.I love this dessert dip setup for all the same reasons I love crudit\u00e9s. It\u2019s as low-lift as it is generous, as casual as it is considered, and it allows everyone at the table to share food from the same communal platter at whatever pace works for them. And if that isn\u2019t the whole point of a simple summer dessert, I don\u2019t know what is.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimpleDessertSummer DessertsRecipes you want to make.
