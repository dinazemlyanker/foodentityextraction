As Test Kitchen manager, it\u2019s part of the job, but it\u2019s also my personal passion (I\u2019m such a clean freak, I\u2019ll wipe down a stove while it\u2019s still hot). So, believe me when I tell you that Skura Style makes the absolute best sponges out there.We go through sponges way quicker than people normally do at home. Sure we use them a lot more, but it\u2019s also because our windows don\u2019t open, which means we have no fresh air coming through the kitchen. Our sponges absorb EVERYTHING going on in the room. If you leave a regular old sponge sitting out over the weekend here, it\u2019ll be dry, crinkly, and smell like sh*t by Monday. We have to throw them out every week. (Trust me, I\u2019ve tried salvaging them by soaking them in Clorox bleach, boiling them, or putting them in the microwave. It never works.)The Skura sponges, on the other hand, last way longer. And, better yet, they never smell. That\u2019s because the super absorbant base\u2014made of patented polyurethane foam instead of cellulose\u2014includes an antimicrobial agent that prevents the growth of mildew, mold, and odor-causing bacteria. The sponge\u2019s firm texture made me really skeptical at first. But as soon as you wet it, it becomes gentle and pliable enough for anything, even curvy wine glasses.You can get your hands on them two ways: Individual packs when you need them, or for situations like ours, a subscription to four-packs, delivered to your door every month or every other month. You know when to move on to a new sponge when the Skura Style logo emblazoned on the scrubby side side completely disappears. If it weren\u2019t for that, I\u2019d probably still be using the same one that started this obsession. And I wouldn\u2019t even be mad about it.Photo by Ted \\+ Chelsea CavanaughSkura Style Sponges$15 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingTest KitchenStaff PicksCleaningRecipes you want to make.
