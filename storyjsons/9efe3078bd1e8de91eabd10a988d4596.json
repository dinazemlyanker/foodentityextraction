Even as a recipe developer and cookbook author who\u2019s no stranger to working from home, lunch in particular presents a conundrum\u2014I never actually even cooked it before quarantine. It\u2019s hard enough to peel myself away from the computer to whip something up in the middle of the day, but coordinating with my family\u2019s five different lunch breaks (and preferences) only adds to the trickiness. There have been wins (that time I made dumplings and teamed it with marinara sauce), there have been losses (even sourdough discard pancakes get boring when you have eaten it 10 days in a row), and there have been lots and lots of Peanut Butter Noodles.Leaning on the power of a few pantry staples, this dish has a depth of flavor and dimension that belies what a fast, easy, flexible, and mindless (and therefore brilliant) solution it is when time and energy are low and lunch-time hunger pangs are high. Though this recipe calls for a mix of peanut butter, rice vinegar, maple syrup, garlic, soy sauce, plus dried noodles, you can think of it more as a formula: A nutty, full-bodied base thinned out with a mix of something acidic to cut through the richness, something sweet for balance, and something salty for a jolt of umami. That means whether you are Team Smooth or Camp Crunchy, any variety of peanut butter is fine. Don\u2019t dig peanuts? Sub for another type of nut or seed butter, or use tahini. If your syrup is low, try honey or sugar. My pantry is always well stocked with Asian noodles\u2014instant ramen, wheat, udon, rice vermicelli, thick rice noodles, soba, somen, egg noodles\u2014and any of these will work great, but so will pasta noodles like spaghetti, linguine, or fettuccine.And while it really is all about the creamy, pourable sauce, a few veggies help to round out the dish and add even more range. Cucumber gives a pleasing fresh crunch, which is why I call for it here, but so would shredded carrots or cabbage. Or, if you have leftover roasted vegetables in the fridge, you could throw those in and ramp up the nutrition factor.Best of all, because it\u2019s just as good cold, you can even make everything in the morning before you sit down to work, and let it hang out on the counter until you, or anyone else in the house, gets hungry. (Both the sauce and noodles are happy at room temperature\u2014just loosen the drained noodles under water before eating.) Present everything, including any accoutrements to dress it up\u2014scallions, sesame oil, chilli oil, sesame seeds, and peanuts\u2014in its own vessel, and let everyone assemble their own bowl. Who knows, maybe it\u2019ll even inspire them to clean up their own dishes while they're at it.Get the Recipe:Peanut Butter Noodles With CucumbersHetty McKinnon\u2019s creamy, crunchy, salty-sweet peanut noodles with cucumbers are busting up our what\u2019s-for-lunch blues.View RecipeRecipes you want to make.
