See our past recommendations here!Executive editor Sonia Chopra, presumably on a caffeine high, plunged the BA \u201coffice\u201d into heated debate with this controversial Slack: \u201cAfter 11 months of being extremely picky about coffee and spending most of my disposable income on beans, I am here to admit that I\u2019m obsessed with the new pistachio brown butter Starbucks latte.\u201d\u201cI want it,\u201d agreed Basically editor Sarah Jampel. Test Kitchen director and resident coffee nerd Chris Morocco registered a note of betrayal\u2014\u201cEt tu, Sonia?\u201d\u2014to which Sonia countered, \u201cI will order literally anything if you tell me it has pistachio in it, I\u2019m sorry!!!!\u201dI\u2019m not a Starbucks drinker, but I am Team Sonia on this one. The best gelato? Pistachio gelato. The best way to eat winter citrus? Drizzled with good olive oil and sprinkled with pistachios. The best reason to have kids? Tiny fingers to do the shelling for you. So it will surprise no one when I say that my new favorite nondairy milk is, yep, pistachio milk.Although there are other nut milks on the market that contain pistachios\u2014in addition to almonds, which are, let\u2019s be honest, a filler nut\u2014T\u00e1che is made with pistachios and pistachios alone. Their original blend is lightly sweetened with cane sugar (there\u2019s also an unsweetened version, but the original blend is the clear winner for me) and, unlike oat milk, contains no added oil. It froths like a champ with the help of one of those $3 wands, or even when shaken. It\u2019s both sweet and savoryish thanks to a little added salt. And, most important, it tastes like pistachios.If you\u2019re someone who favors an alt-milk that adds body but mostly fades into the background, this is maybe not the milk for you. But the fact that T\u00e1che tastes like something\u2014specifically pistachio, king of the nuts!\u2014is the whole point for me. My oatmeal becomes pistachio oatmeal, hot chocolate is now pistachio hot chocolate, and the French toast I made with the last of my Christmas panettone? Pistachio panettone French toast, a string of words that fills me with almost unbearable delight. And while I\u2019m not normally a Bulletproof coffee kinda guy, a spoonful of brown butter stirred into a T\u00e1che latte (made with the good beans) sounds like a great idea. I know Sonia would agree.T\u00e1che Original Blend$48 at T\u00e1che (for six)$7 at Thrive Market (for one)Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish Loves ItShoppingRecipes you want to make.
