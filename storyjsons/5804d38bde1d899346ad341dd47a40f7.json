This luxurious boutique avoids the current hotel design tropes by going back to an earlier period of Danish design. Here you\u2019ll find a more wicker-and-velvet mood, populated by a stylish mix of international design travelers.THE VIBE IS: in-the-know and elegant. Rooms are lovely, though the common spaces, from the fireplace-filled lobby to the rooftop atrium and bar, are even more atmospheric.WORD TO THE WISE: Stay in the the Coup\u00b4e room on a \u201cbudget\u201d and in a Sanders apartment on an expense account. The location, on a magical block in the elegant design and theater district, puts you close to some of the city\u2019s best eating spots, be it Apollo Bar or Ved Stranden 10. The staff is young, excellent, and used to demanding folks. Ask them anything!PRACTICAL STUFF: Rooms start at $375.\u2014Christine MuhlkeWE ALSO LOVEHotel AlexandraTake home design tips from this midcentury City Hall Square hotel Slurp Ramen JointObsessively, meticulously made ramen that\u2019s got people lining up in Indre ByNobis Hotel CopenhagenReally treat yourself at this luxe downtown district lodgingExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
