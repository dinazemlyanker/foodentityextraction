When you carry a tote bag, you\u2019re essentially hauling around a billboard that says, \u201cHey! Look! This is what I\u2019m all about! Judge me!\u201d Okay, maybe not judge me, but we all know these rudimentary canvas sacks are more than just a carryall: They\u2019re signposts for the crews we belong to. These days, we\u2019ve noticed more and more totes for restaurants, wine stores, and coffee shops showing up on shoulders, doing the work of announcing who we are and what gets us going. So what does your tote say about you? Read on to find out.All products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.

And The Final Table. And Salt. Fat. Acid. Heat. And Chef\u2019s Table (and yes, we know you it makes you really emotional). If there\u2019s a food show streaming somewhere, you\u2019ve already binged it. You\u2019re spending all your time with David Chang, Samin Nostrat, and Philip Rosenthal you\u2019ve barely left the house to go see your real friends. But you swear you will...after you finish Street Food. Only three more episodes to go.What\u2019s in it: Pocky. Zapp\u2019s Potato Chips. BjornQorn. Haribo gummies. And a case of La Croix.Photo by Chelsie CraigMiddle Child, PhiladelphiaYou design interiors. Okay, you decorated your apartment, at the very least. You love pointing out brutalist architecture. You understand the relevance of the Memphis movement. And at this point, you\u2019ve explained the impact of the Eames Lounge Chair more times than you can count. (Molded plywood was revolutionary, folks!) Design of just about any kind is very much your bag, which is why a restaurant like Middle Child, with its deliciously well-constructed sandwiches, checks all your boxes. Finish your corned beef, egg, and cheese sandwich and grab that geometric tote\u2014you\u2019ve got to go find a place to read the Sight Unseen newsletter.What\u2019s in it: Vintage IKEA catalogues. A Hay Design water bottle. A notebook (with grid-lined paper, of course). And some fancy pencils you paid way too much money for.Photo by Chelsie CraigElena x Pumpui, MontrealYou\u2019re a multi-tasker. You constantly juggle gigs, plans, dates, and the occasional party. That\u2019s why you like a tote that represents two restaurants at once. It also helps that one of those spots, Elena, is a pizza joint, wine bar, and coffee shop all in one. You thrive as a member of the Slash Generation, spending your afternoons taking calls while eating your naturally leavened potato and Parm square slice, and your evenings eating dinner with close friends who are also your business partners. We admire your efficiency. Keep up the hustle.What\u2019s in it: Your laptop. Noise-cancelling headphones. Three chargers. Business cards. A thermos full of coffee. A daily planner. And a pen...in there somewhere...Photo by Chelsie CraigRolf and Daughters, NashvilleTo you, restaurant merch is as much a part of everyday life as breathing or eating sourdough bread. You\u2019re a restaurant swag OG, and you respect the industry\u2019s institutions\u2014like the South\u2019s finest purveyors of handmade pasta and heritage pork ragout. You\u2019ve been rocking quirky, in-the-know culinary gear forever, or at least since Rolf and Daughters started doing simple screen-printed goods in 2012. What\u2019s that? Seven years ago? Yeah, forever. It takes years to develop merch taste like yours.What\u2019s in it: Another restaurant tote. A baseball cap from your hometown deli. And a collab t-shirt your friend from the pizza shop (which will remain unnamed for her sake) wasn\u2019t supposed to give to you yet.Buy It: Rolf TotePhoto by Chelsie CraigPsychic Wines, Los AngelesThis is a sulfur-free zone, thank you very much. You\u2019re all about natural wine, and to be clear, you\u2019ve been that way for much longer than everyone else. You call orange wine \u201cskin contact white,\u201d and although you recently went through a pretty intense carbonic maceration phase, you\u2019ve decided you prefer being able to taste the unadulterated flavor of the Loire Valley  grapes\u2014along with every drop of sweat put into that two-hectare plot.What\u2019s in it: A bottle of $38 Grolleau. A heavily underlined copy of \u201cWine. All the Time.\u201d A fiscally irresponsible number of Castelvetrano olives. And the wine key attached to your keychain.Photo by Chelsie CraigBuxton Hall BBQ, Asheville, NCYou understand commitment. Plans after a long Tuesday at work? You\u2019ll be there. Friend moving into a new apartment on Sunday morning? You show up to help. Told your Grandma that you\u2019d be at her birthday party? Of course you will. You\u2019re a steadfast friend and know how to rise to the occasion. You put in the hours, and it shows. So you appreciate others who do the same, which is why smoking a whole hog overnight the way they do at Buxton is something you respect. That\u2019s dedication. Juicy, fatty dedication.What\u2019s in it: A hammer and nails (to help your friend hang those paintings). A box of homemade chocolate chip cookies for Katie\u2019s birthday party. And the copy of \u201cNormal People\u201d you said you\u2019d loan to Kevin.Photo by Chelsie CraigReanimator Coffee Roasters, PhiladelphiaAlarm at 5:30 a.m. Yoga at 6:30. And that\u2019s all before you hop on your bike for the daily 16-mile ride to your high-powered job. You\u2019re an early riser with a go-getter personality, thirsty (figuratively) for the next challenge. That\u2019s why you\u2019re thirsty (literally) for your pour over, brewed with some fruity, expertly roasted Kenyan beans, from Reanimator. The cafe is the perfect match for your wild-energy-meets-calculated-precision personality. Sure, you might be a little hard to keep up with, but hey, that\u2019s their problem, not yours.What\u2019s in it: Your yoga mat. A foldable bike helmet. And a completed crossword from the Sunday paper (which, for the record, you did by yourself).But It: Reanimator TotePhoto by Chelsie CraigRose Foods, Portland, MEYour following anyone who\u2019s anyone in the food scene. You know where Natasha Pickowicz ate dinner last night; which wine bars Fabi\u00e1n von Hauske Valtierra and Jeremiah Stone visited last time they were in France; which city Matty Matheson is currently in for his book tour. You know who Jessica Koslow is collaborating with and where Camille Beccara is cooking next. And you know that everyone at Bon App\u00e9tit carries this Rose Foods tote. You hear your friend is going to Portland and ask her to grab you one. You\u2019re already in the know, so you might as well look the part.What\u2019s in it: A signed copy of Where Cooking Begins. A pen from Via Carota. A stolen bottle list from The Ten Bells. And a journal filled with names of restaurants you need to get to.Photo by Chelsie CraigFour Horsemen, BrooklynIs that a haul of records in your tote? Yeah it is, picked up from that vinyl store you\u2019ve been trying not to tell anyone about. You\u2019re a music freak that ends up at bars that double as vinyl clubs, or restaurants owned by, say...James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem. You haven\u2019t spoken to anyone on the street since 2014; you\u2019re too busy making your way through Spotify playlists you\u2019ve bookmarked, like that new \u201870s-era Nigerian disco playlist you found last night.What\u2019s in it: A first pressing of Curtis Mayfield\u2019s Curtis and a worn but playable copy of Harvest Moon you found in the cheap bins. A McIntosh catalogue. A six pack of High Life, and a 100 percent cotton bandana.Buy It: Four Horsemen TotePhoto by Chelsie CraigLil\u2019 Deb\u2019s OasisWhere the hell is the party at? We\u2019re asking you, because you certainly know. You\u2019re in just about every scene worth being in. Yes, you saw that German DJ spin at the after-after-warehouse party last night. Yes, you know how to get into that sold out Annie Clark show and who to text about securing a couple nights at that exclusive, off-the-grid B&B upstate. And yes, you were definitely at The Lil\u2019 Deb\u2019s Oasis pop-up in Maine last month. Of course you were. You\u2019re everywhere, and you know everyone. Which reminds us, can you get us into that Martine Gutierrez show tonight? Please?What\u2019s in it: Two airplane bottles of tequila. A copy of Broccoli magazine. And a pack of Parliaments that may or may not be yours.Buy It: Lil' Deb's TotePhoto by Chelsie CraigThe Walrus and The Carpenter, SeattleYou\u2019re a bit more refined than the rest of your friends, but you\u2019re not a snob about anything. And as the Walrus and The Carpenter tote slung over the shoulder of that crewneck from your prestigious alma mater shows, you think a platter of oysters is a casual afternoon snack. You\u2019re not wrong. But you know to pair it with a beer to keep things humble. There\u2019s no need for Champagne; you\u2019re not insufferable. But you do play squash.What\u2019s in it: A pair of loafers. The keys to your Volvo. And of course, a few squash balls and your racquet, because Thomas said he\u2019d be down for doubles after lunch.Buy It: The Walrus and The Carpenter TotePhoto by Chelsie CraigKismetLos Angeles isn\u2019t just where you live. It\u2019s how you live. The farmers\u2019 market is your church. You spend your weekend mornings walking from vendor to vendor, admiring the watermelon radishes, inspecting the Japanese greens, and talking about types of obscure citrus that \u201cthose people on the East Coast just don\u2019t have access to.\u201d In one hand, you clutch a carbon-neutral, braided hemp leash, with your Labradoodle panting at the end. She was a rescue, in case anyone was wondering. In the other, you\u2019ve got a sparkling CBD seltzer that\u2019s numbing the effects of all that Mezcal you drank last night. You could have sworn that mezcal didn\u2019t give you hangovers. But if anyone asks, you\u2019re feeling absolutely brilliant.What\u2019s in it: A green juice. Artisanal sunscreen. Heirloom tomatoes. A melon you\u2019ve never tried before. A container filled with Ashwagandha. And a jade roller.Photo by Chelsie CraigDiner, BrooklynYou remember when Williamsburg was more than expensive condos, mass-market IPAs, and crowds of drunk twenty-somethings. You lived nearby when Diner first opened two decades ago, and instantly became a regular. Though you aged out of the area some time ago, you still make it back to this restaurant to watch the staff write the menu on the table, sip a Presidente, and enjoy one of the city\u2019s finest burgers. That\u2019s why you had to snag one of the limited-edition anniversary tote bags, as a reminder to everyone else in line that, while they were still eating lunchables in the cafeteria, you and the bartender were already on a first-name basis.What\u2019s in it: A She Wolf Bakery toasted sesame loaf. A small Helen Levi planter for the side table in the living room. A very cute stuffed koala. And your kid\u2019s sippy cup.Buy It: Diner Anniversary ToteExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
