Quite the contrary. I don\u2019t care for American cheese because I grew up with a processed cheese that is far superior. Allow me to introduce you to Amul cheese, India\u2019s greatest dairy product to ever come from a can.Amul, an Indian dairy company based in Gujarat, specializes is butter, yogurt, ice cream, and cheese made using milk from Indian buffalos, which lends a very specific flavor\u2014it\u2019s richer, a little nuttier, a little funkier. It started in 1948 as a dairy cooperative meant to help bring milk products to smaller cities in response to a monopoly created by a company called Polson. Many of the people Amul was selling to didn\u2019t have access to refrigeration, so shelf-stable, long-lasting products were developed, like the cheese (its official shelf life is nine months). People in India are crazy loyal to Amul products, but it\u2019s that cheese that inspires by far the most cultiness. #Amulcheese is a trending hashtag with close to 2,500 posts. And then there are these ads, in which a reserved boy eats a slice of Amul cheese before a big game/when he is about to perform on stage/when he finds a monster in his closet\u2014and he somehow gains cheese-powered super-confidence. People love them.Imagine the super-confidence that awaits you.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigAmul cheese is a hard, canned cheese that tastes like cheddar with a plot twist. It\u2019s got a familiar buttery flavor, but it\u2019s slightly sour. It\u2019s hard but pliable, melts beautifully, and is saltier than you\u2019d expect. Because it\u2019s canned and packed with who knows how many preservatives, it will last forever. I distinctly remember when my dad would stockpile cans and cans of Amul cheese at the top of our pantry, and those would last us for the year. Our favorite way to eat it was grating and then melting it onto tomato toast, with a sprinkling of chaat masala, which brought out all of Amul cheese\u2019s wonderfully weird flavors. In my cookbook, the tomato-cheese toast recipe calls for cheddar, because Amul cheese isn\u2019t widely available\u2014but if you really want to eat the dish as the Krishnas do, you should order a can online. Once you\u2019ve had a grilled cheese made with Amul cheese, the American cheese version will forever taste bland and boring.Beyond the taste, the cult of Amul cheese has mainly to do with the nostalgia that it carries. Like Maggi noodles, India\u2019s Instant ramen of choice, or Parle-G cookies, our preferred tea accompaniment, Amul cheese takes Indians of multiple generations back to their childhoods. My dad always told me that Amul cheese, more than anything else, tasted like India to him. To me, it tastes like being at my parents\u2019 house in Texas.Because it\u2019s such a home pantry staple, I\u2019ve been surprised to see the cheese in dishes at popular Indian restaurants: mixed with chilies and stuffed in naan at Adda in Long Island City, in a grilled cheese with mint chutney at USHA foods in Queens, and in a chicken-chutney sandwich at Pondicheri, in Houston and New York.Chintan Pandya, the chef of Adda, told me that he first tried Amul cheese when he was 9 or 10\u2014it was a luxury to his family, something that he was only able to eat on special occasions. \u201cI still crave the taste of it. Every other cheese, despite the best of taste and ingredients, just feels a bit cerebral.\u201dLast year, he says there was a shortage of Amul cheese in New York and New Jersey. \u201cI ended up personally driving to stores in Philadelphia to pick up as much Amul cheese as I could,\u201d he says. \u201cMy chefs recommended that I use cheddar, but I would not do it as I felt it would be affecting the integrity of the Indian dish.\u201dSimilarly, Anita Jaisinghani, the chef of Pondicheri, grew up in India with Amul as the only cheese available in stores. She calls it her \u201csecret weapon\u201d in her restaurants. \u201cIt has a creamy, intense flavor that is like none other,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd this is from a person who eats almost nothing processed.\u201dAmul cheese\u2019s success is somewhat improbable. Here\u2019s an almost completely artificial food that has depth and complexity, that\u2019s beloved by Indians alike (even chefs!), and that I would take over cheddar any day of the week. I am fully aware of its flaws, but I love it so much anyway. Unlike most other things in my life, I accept Amul cheese for exactly what it is. And there\u2019s something pretty wonderful about that.Buy it: Amul Cheese, 14 oz., is $12 at Snuk FoodsPriya Krishna\u2019s cookbook Indian-ish, documenting her journey of learning to make the distinct, hybridized cuisine of her chic, extremely skilled-in-the-kitchen mom, Ritu, is now out from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt!
