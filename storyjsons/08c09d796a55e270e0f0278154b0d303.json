The three of them use their backgrounds in food, fine arts, education, and the law to look at how food, art, and justice intersect. \u201cPeople\u2019s Kitchen has always looked at how recipes tell the stories of who we are,\u201d Keval says. \u201cIf we look at a recipe as a primary source document, you\u2019re also passing down everything that generation\u2019s gone through.\u201dPKC is committed to bringing people together to enjoy a home-cooked meal, using local and organic ingredients to feed as many as they can. They also run educational programs to spread knowledge and engage with the history and politics of food. For the past year, they a ran a four-part series aimed at bringing together the food stories and practices of a community, called \u201cFrom the FARM to the KITCHEN to the TABLE to the STREETS!\u201dPeoples Kitchen Collective cofounders Jocelyn Jackson, Saqib Keval, and Sita Kuratomi Bhaumik.\nPhoto by Sana Javeri KadriOn Sunday, May 20 (the birthday weekend of Malcolm X and Yuri Kochiyama), that series culminated in a free community meal for 500 people at one long table in West Oakland. Artists, performers, activists, and musicians facilitated conversations about movement-building, cultural preservation, and self-determination. In October, they will be hosting their annual Free Breakfast Program inspired by the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense at the Life is Living Festival. A few days before The Streets, the members of People\u2019s Kitchen Collective told me more about their work and their most recent series.How did People\u2019s Kitchen start?Saqib Keval: I started People\u2019s Kitchen about 11 years ago. I was working in a lot of fine dining and then my other life was doing a lot of activist work\u2014a lot of community-based organizing, a lot of social justice work, and civil rights work. I was working in these restaurants and working in these dining spaces that 1) were taking me away from these meetings and 2) I was cooking and serving food in places that were really exclusive. I knew there could be more. I wanted to create an alternative to that, and that\u2019s how People\u2019s Kitchen started.We did a meal every month and the meal told a story. The menu told a story of a different political movement and there was no price on the menu. You\u2019d come, you ate, and you paid what you could. Whatever you gave went directly to the political project that the meal was geared toward. There\u2019s no publicity, there\u2019s no PR. It was very community organized and very grassroots. You\u2019d get houseless people coming, teachers, families, couples out on dates\u2014it was a very unique dining experience.And then word got out about it, and the dynamics started shifting. We got a lot more self-described foodies and people who were looking for the new dining fad. I found out that people were selling reservations on Craigslist and that really threw me for a loop. Like who\u2019s selling these $50 reservations for a free community meal? [Sita, Jocelyn, and I] turned it into a collective. We kept doing large-scale free community meals, we started doing the Black Panther Free Breakfast programs. We kept doing a handful of things, but stopped the monthly meals.Tell me a little bit about your background.SK: I\u2019m from a really large immigrant family. I grew up where it was normal to cook for 200 people at our family functions and that equally pushed me as a chef in my restaurant life but also in my life around organizing and food and building community.Sita Kuratomi Bhaumik: I\u2019m an artist and I actually started cooking as a way, really, to encourage people to come to organizing meetings at my house. I have never worked professionally in a restaurant. I always tell people I\u2019m authorized only to make art and I have no license to make food. But I come to it as part of my art practice.Jocelyn Jackson: I feel a real draw to continuing to tell the stories of my ancestors and that being a crucial part of my own survival\u2014remembering these flavors, remembering these recipes, remembering the stories and experiences, as an individual, and as a person who takes a sincere and deep responsibility for the community that I am a part of.Why the kitchen, specifically?SK: The first thing that a colonizer does to control the population is to divorce them from their food and their food sources. By changing a people\u2019s diet, you change who they are, and you change their access to their own sense of self and their histories. That made me want to do food justice work and organizing work. A recipe puts a community in a time in a place, because by looking at a recipe, you know what ingredients they had access to.SKB: Food is not without its pitfalls. I think there\u2019s a lot of times that we can think, oh, you know, how wonderful we all just sat down together and broke bread, but to me, it\u2019s actually much more complicated than that. What are you serving? Whose table is it? How are you eating? Who\u2019s invited? All of those questions actually can create and have created a lot of divisions, but I think the promise of food, for me, is where it\u2019s a place where people can see each other.Can you talk about \u201cFrom the Farm to the Kitchen to the Table to the Streets?\u201dJJ: When we say \u2018farm,\u2019 it is not only the fact that there\u2019s beautiful produce propagated and cultivated on these pieces of land\u2014the farm also means that for some people in their ancestry, including my own, that it used to be \u2018plantation.\u2019 It used to be a place of deep trauma and struggle. With Kitchen, we had this chance to collect people\u2019s stories around what your elders, your family, gave you to find healing in your life. We\u2019re talking about physical ills, but we\u2019re also talking about social ills. We need to tend to the health of our social communities.SKB: We had two collaborators, one from Mexico and one from India, and we asked them to bring a suitcase with the flavors of home. We didn\u2019t know what they were going to bring. When they arrived in the kitchen before the event, we cooked a dish made out of those ingredients. I think so often, even when language doesn\u2019t get passed down, flavors do. I don\u2019t speak fluent Bengali, but I know those flavors of mustard and of coconut.JJ: With Kitchen, we had this chance to collect people\u2019s stories around what your elders, your family, gave you to find healing in your life. We\u2019re talking about physical ills, but we\u2019re also talking about social ills. We need to tend to the health of our social communities.SKB: The Table meal was a really personal experience for me in that it commemorated Executive Order 9066, which also fell on President\u2019s Day this year. [That\u2019s] the order that [Franklin D.] Roosevelt signed, incarcerating Japanese-Americans during World War II. We wanted to think about how that history can connect with the Muslim ban and registry, with incarcerated peoples, and also with undocumented folks.JJ: [With the Streets,] there is a marked difference of having a meal inside and then having a meal on your stoop, you know what I mean? It is that moment for everyone to take notice and to really acknowledge the issues that we are presenting.SK: We need to demand that the voices that we don\u2019t hear are the ones that we give priority to. You know the saying, \u201cThere\u2019s too many cooks in the kitchen?\u201d That\u2019s the exact opposite of what we\u2019re going for. We try to fill the kitchen with as many cooks as possible, and that\u2019s intentional.What sustains you in this work?SKB: People. For me, it\u2019s absolutely the relationships that are built in the meals that we produce. Something about this feeling of if you are in collaboration with someone, what you can do together is more than what you can do alone.JJ: When we\u2019re in the kitchen, we are doing the work of honoring our ancestors by enjoying the process. At the end of one of these events, I\u2019m tired, but I\u2019m also visibly enriched. There is such a giddiness to being able to create this kind of space for community to share.SK: I\u2019ve been doing People\u2019s Kitchen for years now and I\u2019ve stepped away, I\u2019ve taken breaks, but I can\u2019t leave. Growing this project and discourse around food and activism and politics is very, very important. There are more people having these conversations in the mainstream food spaces\u2014more food writers of color, food writers in general, I think\u2014approaching these questions and asking them. And that\u2019s exciting for me. It makes me feel like we\u2019ve been doing something right.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishOaklandBay AreaEventsInterviewsRead MorecultureAileen Suzara Is Flipping the Script About 'Unhealthy' Filipino FoodBy Melissa Pandika Recipes you want to make.
