Sign up for our newsletter, and you\u2019ll get this letter before everyone else.It\u2019s been a week since my last newsletter, but as I sit down to write this, I feel like I\u2019m dropping back in from another dimension. Seven days ago, my kids were in school, my husband went to work in an office every day, and I was still going to the gym. Well, schools in NYC are now closed, my husband and I are both working remotely, and my workouts have moved outside. The only thing that remains the same is that we\u2019re all still trying to figure out what foods we should buy, cook, and eat.Last week, Bon App\u00e9tit asked for your quarantine-related cooking questions on Twitter, and I answered many of them on Instagram. Whether you tuned in to the Story or not (and it\u2019s not too late to watch!), I wanted to share a few of the most helpful takeaways for the current moment\u2014which is changing faster than we can even anticipate\u2014right here.Want this letter before it hits the website?

If you\u2019re a meat eater, I recommend braising a brisket, which will put some of the pantry items you probably already picked up (canned tomatoes, carrots, onions, and garlic) to good use, and will give you a reasonably priced stockpile of saucy, shreddy, tender meat that vastly outweighs the effort you put in. This will yield enough for several meals: Try making brisket tacos (I would put sauerkraut or kimchi on them), brisket hash, chopped up brisket as sauce for egg noodles, or, you know, eating cold brisket while standing up at your kitchen counter, because it\u2019s your house and you can do what you want. You can also set aside a big portion for freezing (or drop some off with a neighbor who doesn\u2019t cook or could use some extra support, but only if you\u2019re comfortable with that). Yes, this is me telling you to make one thing and eat it over and over until it\u2019s gone, and that\u2019s on purpose. There\u2019s a constant stream of new information coming down the pike. Thinking about what new and different thing to make every night can be too much to worry about\u2014having dinner in the bank is a gift.Just try not to devour this all.\nPhoto by Emma Fishman, Food Styling by Yekaterina BoytsovaPower Up on ProduceOver the weekend, some shoppers\u2014especially those who hit big-box stores\u2014encountered empty canned goods aisles, cleared-out frozen food sections, and cereal in short supply. Panic-buying can do that to a place (it reminds me of the way people respond when there\u2019s a blizzard in the forecast). If this happens to you, remember two things: The inventory will be restocked. Everything I\u2019ve read to date supports this. Our supply chain is intact and there\u2019s plenty of food to be distributed (including everything that\u2019s being diverted from now-shuttered college cafeterias, cruise ships, Vegas buffets, and elementary schools). Check back in a day or two; some stores are changing hours to give staff more time to unload deliveries and keep the store clean, but the shelves will refill. Or try a smaller, local purveyor before giving up (while the Trader Joe\u2019s in my Brooklyn neighborhood is a zoo, every bodega I\u2019ve gone into has been a dream). Don\u2019t forget the produce aisle. Rice and beans are great and everything, but have you ever had a batch of braised greens, a skillet of caramelized cabbage, a pan of cheesy broccoli, or a platter of sweet and salty Chinese broccoli? Fresh veggies are abundant, nutritious, inexpensive, quick to prepare, and extremely good for you. Knock yourself out. Most cooked veg will last a few days in the fridge\u2014if you can manage not to eat it in one sitting.No banana should ever go to waste.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, styling by Claire SaffitzPut Things in the Freezer Besides PizzaThe coldest storage is for so much more than frozen spinach and DiGiorno pizza. Here are three things you should have on ice:Good bread, pre-sliced, wrapped airtight. Buy the most beautiful loaf you can find; keep it frozen and you won\u2019t waste a crumb.Denuded bananas\u2014the ones that got really ripe on your counter but you\u2019re not making banana bread any time soon. Peel them, freeze them, then drop them into smoothies (or, defrost when you\u2019re in the mood to bake!).Grain-cooking liquid. What\u2019s that now? Every time you make a batch of grains by simmering them in salted, olive oil\u2013gilded water, save the cooking liquid. It can be used for the next batch of grains or beans, in lieu of stock for a soup, or as part of the braising liquid for any meat.I know there\u2019s a lot to be unsure of right now, but for those of us who love to cook, there\u2019s a lot to feel positive about, too. You can continue to feed yourself, your family\u2014and others, if that feels safe\u2014and I hope that in doing so, you find relief, and a release.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterCoronavirusRecipes you want to make.
