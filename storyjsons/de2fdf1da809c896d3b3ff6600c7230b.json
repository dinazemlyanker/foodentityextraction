See our past recommendations here!I'm a pretty indiscriminate ice cream eater. Ben & Jerry's and Talenti and the fussy small-batch stuff are all my favorite children; I'd never pick just one. But when it comes to \"healthy\" ice cream, I'm picky. I don't expect my frozen yogurt or nondairy pint to taste like the Tonight Dough, but it has to be delicious. Well, I've tried 'em all, folks, and Sunscoop is tops.The first thing to know about Sunscoop is that it's creamy right out of the freezer, even though it's dairy-free. No need to leave it out to thaw like some other vegan ice cream brands. Maybe that's because the first ingredient is coconut cream. The next thing to know is that every flavor I\u2019ve tried tastes amazing. The Vanilla Tart is a Pinkberry surrogate (remember them?!); the Dark Cacao with Reishi is deep and rich; and the Moringa Mint Chip almost converted me to a mint chip fan.Sunscoop's founder, Carli Blum, has a ton of food allergies, which is why she developed a line of ice creams free of dairy, gluten, nuts, soy, and eggs. And as someone who has dabbled with brown rice syrup in kitchen experiments gone awry, I am convinced that she (and Sunscoop's recipe developers) are wizards. It's the only sweetener they use! Yes, the vegan ice cream flavors are laced with adaptogens and other trendy things. Roll your eyes, but also grab a spoon. It's not often that wellness tastes so sweet.Courtesy of SunscoopSunscoop 4-Pack$80 at Amazon$70 at SunscoopExplore Bon App\u00e9titIce CreamHealthyish Loves ItHealthyishShoppingVeganRead MoreCaramelized Banana and Almond Nice CreamRecipes you want to make.
