I made it with thyme and rosemary sprigs, leaving out the coriander because I didn\u2019t have it.  I plan on making a large batch next time so I can have some on hand as well as freeze some in small containers.P CaseyRockbridge Baths VA1/5/2022delicious can\u2019t wait to made eat ENJOY thanks for recipes Jeannette Bailey Wichita Falls Tx.3/15/2021This dish is a staple in our house, from crostini appetizers to ramen.  We keep a jar of it in our fridge most weeks to jazz up puttanesca, eggs, Mac and cheese, soup, the possibilities are endless.  Sub Rosemary for thyme, press the garlic, skip the coriander, it\u2019s all good!!  Have fun and play with it! Threesco Coquitlam, BC3/14/2021Great way to use my CSA cherry tomatoes. A little juicier than pictured, but still deliciousAnonymousDC7/19/2020Delicious! Picture this: a perfect slice of sourdough toast, a smear of ricotta cheese, and these beautiful tomatoes on top-- bon appetit. I had a bottle of gourmet rosemary flavored olive oil I was dying to use, and this was the perfect solution. 10/10 would make again, and I don't usually like tomatoes very much. I'm converted.AnonymousPaso Robles, CA5/2/2020Great recipe! Skipped the coriander, added a couple of thyme sprigs along with the rosemary. Enjoyed with crostini and burrata, will also likely serve with some saut\u00e9ed zucchini.\n\nQuestion: Would this freeze well in smaller batches? Anyone have experience with this! Thanks!Lucy DBoston, MA8/28/2019So good! And so easy! Served with burrata, and this will a dinner party constant in my house :)Tanaya AlpaiwallaNew York12/8/2018This is my new favorite way to have tomatoes! I prepared the recipe as is and I love the oily-tomatoey-juicy goodness that is left behind! I dip bread in the oil and spread the tomatoes on top. H-E-A-V-E-N! EbobeboSaint Louis9/15/2018Wonderful recipe. I will cut the oil in half next time the juices from the tomatoes makes a nice amount of sauce. I just dipped some Como bread, Joshua McFadden's roasted almonds and a glass of Pinot Noir. Lovely. I used whole coriander.\nFall has arrived.iz2Duvall, WA9/10/2018The cherry tomatoes are awesome and would you grind the coriander first or just leave whole?
