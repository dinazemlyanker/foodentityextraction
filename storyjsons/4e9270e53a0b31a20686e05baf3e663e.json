We almost forgot that he\u2019s also a Hollywood star. But what we really want to know: What\u2019s Tucci doing for Thanksgiving?1. First, a Martini\u201cToo many people say too many things, and I wish they\u2019d stop,\u201d writes Tucci about the iconic cocktail\u2019s origins. \u201cThe only thing that matters is that the martini exists.\u201d Tucci has been drinking his the same way for ages: gin or vodka (each has its time and place) with just a whiff of vermouth, and stirred not shaken\u2014sorry, 007. It\u2019s \u201cthe quintessence of elegance that we all aspire to and believe we acquire when we drink one,\u201d he writes.Do it like Tucci:Stanley Tucci\u2019s MartiniGin or vodka? Tucci\u2019s recipe allows for either, depending on your mood. Just make sure it\u2019s stirred, never shaken.View RecipePhotograph by Emma Fishman2. Don\u2019t Skimp on AppsTucci\u2019s mother was all about the antipasti, even if there\u2019s a big meal ahead. \u201cThere\u2019d be cured meats like prosciutto and salami, cheeses, olives, roasted peppers; there might be raw seafood, almost like a ceviche,\u201d Tucci recalls.Photograph by Myles New3. Stay ClassicWhat\u2019s on Tucci\u2019s table? Turkey, of course, and stuffing with water chestnuts and hunks of bread. The cranberry sauce is homemade and the sweet potatoes are baked with butter, honey, brown sugar, and maple syrup (no, three sweeteners is not overkill). For greenery Tucci does brussels sprouts with pancetta, obviously. Leftovers? An open-face turkey and gravy sandwich\u2014cranberry sauce and mashed potatoes on the side.Photograph by Emma Fishman4. Bring Out the Good ChinaWhether he\u2019s hosting a crowd or keeping it small, Tucci sets a formal table: china, flowers, candles, the whole nine. \u201cWhen I was growing up, my dad, who is an artist, would always make little place cards,\u201d he tells us. One year Tucci drew a cornucopia, then had it printed on his own cards.Photograph by Emma Fishman5. Bear Gifts\u201cMy parents never visited their parents without bringing something,\u201d Tucci writes. They were all so focused on generosity that squabbles broke out practically every Sunday, with Tucci\u2019s grandmother trying to pay for a chicken or even return cheese his parents had brought. Tucci \u201cstill cannot bear the thought of arriving at someone\u2019s home empty-handed.\u201d Italians often bring olive oil, bread, or salt; Tucci\u2019s go-to is wine.Photograph by Emma Fishman6. A Few Words About Pasta\u201cThere\u2019s always a place at the table for pasta\u201d is a Tucci truism. His mom was even known to serve a pasta course before the Thanksgiving meal. But even Tucci admits that was extra. \u201cSometimes you just knew you had so much food that you didn\u2019t really need the pasta,\u201d he says. However and whenever you want your pasta, here are Tucci\u2019s rules, as he tells it in his memoir, out now.\u201cI feel it must be said that not all wheat flour pasta works with all sauces. The shape of the pasta is as important as the makeup and quality of its ingredients when it comes to the success of pairing it with the appropriate sauce; you might call it a divine coupling.\u00a0\u201cItalians are very, very, very particular about what pasta goes with what sauce. Only certain salse complement certain paste and vice versa. This is why in any worthwhile Italian cookbook there will be at most three different types of pasta suggested to accompany a specific sauce. There have been times when someone in my household (no names) made a traditional family sauce and served it with a completely incompatible pasta. I cannot describe the feeling I have when confronted with this. First, I am angry at myself for not being able to cook the meal, most likely because I was doing something annoying like acting (an activity that frankly is beginning to wear a bit thin as the years go by), and second, I am confounded that whoever made the choice (no names) does not innately know that, as per example, the combination of star pasta and a meat rag\u00f9 is an act of heresy. As far as I am concerned, they may as well have just cut out my tongue with a broadsword and danced on the graves of my ancestors.\u00a0\u201cMy suggestion to anyone who eats pasta either with or without gluten is, please pair it with the appropriate sauce and vice versa, because you never know who might be watching. Here are a few wonderful and, for me, acceptable combinations of paste and salse.\u201dSpaghetti: Salsa pomodoro con tonno, carbonara, vongoleRigatoni: Beef-based rag\u00f9, all\u2019AmatricianaDitali: Salsa pomodoro con piselli, salsa pomodoro con cozzeWant More Tucci?Taste: My Life Through FoodStanley Tucci is a winsome guide to the food of Italy, and his charm on the page is no less winning than it is onscreen. In his new memoir, Taste: My Life Through Food, Tucci shares his love for food, both Stateside and in Italy, in a wry and conversational tone. And he can\u2019t help but offer some firm opinions on pastas.\n$28 $18 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titThanksgivingItalianRead MorerecipesThe 69 Best Thanksgiving RecipesGallery69 SlidesBy Nico AvallecookingBehold!
