The reality is that no one ever wants a soup course, and also most people don\u2019t really care what you cook for them\u2014they just want to hang out and drink wine.These days, my dinner party strategy is to delegate as much as possible. I\u2019ll ask my wine-obsessed friend to bring a bottle or two of whatever she\u2019s digging at the moment. The friend who works around the corner from the farmers\u2019 market is responsible for procuring good bread. And me? I make a simple main (like this jammy summer squash pasta) and house dip, then dump a bag of pita chips into a pretty bowl (no offense, Stacy) and call it a night.What is \"house dip,\" you ask? It\u2019s the dip that you can whip up using only ingredients you already have in your fridge and pantry. (If you have to take a trip to the store to make it, it\u2019s not house dip.) House dip tells your guests, \u201cI really like you, but I\u2019m not trying to spend an entire day cooking for you.\u201d Lemony garlic yogurt\u2014which is exactly as easy as it sounds\u2014is my standard, and you will not believe how many people ask, \u201cWhaAAaaT is THIIIIS?\u201d every time I make it. But when it\u2019s summer and the herbs are the freshest they\u2019ll be all year, I am HERE for this Fiery Green Tahini Dip.This creamy, spicy, fresh-as-hell, vibrantly green dip is just a bunch of fresh herbs blended with lemon juice, chiles, fresh herbs, garlic, extra-virgin olive oil, then whisked together with some creamy-dreamy tahini. Das it! (Oh, and salt. Most people criminally under-salt dips. Don\u2019t.) It\u2019s one of those recipes that combines familiar flavors in a way that feels fresh and new and different. It also goes with everything: Ruffly potato chips. Wildly expensive Little Gem lettuces. Crunchy radishes. Falafel. Crunchy vegetables of all stripes. Cold chicken. Hot chicken. Fried chicken!The real beauty of this dip is that almost every single fresh ingredient can be swapped for whatever you have in the house. Use limes instead of lemons, jalape\u00f1os or even a seeded habanero (if you\u2019re feeling ~*sPiCy*~) instead of serranos. Any mix of soft herbs can replace some of the parsley; at my house that means a big handful of basil from my jaunty new plant. Whatever you choose to swap in, don\u2019t overthink it\u2014I promise it will still be delicious as long as you don\u2019t skip the base of garlic, olive oil, tahini, and salt.So the next time you have friends over and set out a bowl of this and someone inevitably asks, \u201cWhaAAaaT is THIIIIS?\u201d you\u2019ll know what to say: \u201cOh, this? It\u2019s house dip.\u201dGet the Recipe:Fiery Green Tahini SauceThis is the condiment version of those summer sandals you want to wear with everything.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titNever FailDipCrudite DipEntertainingRecipes you want to make.
