We got you. Welcome to Happy Hour with Al, a monthly column where Al Culliton, Basically\u2019s resident bartender, sets you up to get the most bang for your booze with the fewest possible bottles.What\u2019s that? You think Scotch is expensive and for old people? Well, I\u2019m here to tell you about blended Scotch, which is less expensive than the single malt stuff and is the perfect base for winter cocktails, regardless of your age.Let\u2019s take a step back: Scotch is a form of whisky and, yes, I am spelling it right: When the whisky is from Scotland (or Japan!) there\u2019s no e before the y. Scotch and its close cousin, Irish whiskey, are two of the western world\u2019s most ancient distilled spirits, a product of Celtic ingenuity paired with a deep love of drink. Whisky comes from the Gaelic for \u201cwater of life,\u201d uisge beatha. As with many spirits, Scotch has its own regulations, but most importantly all Scotches must: be made in Scotland, contain malted barley (but can include other whole-grain cereals like wheat, rye, or corn), and aged at least three years in oak. A blended Scotch can include these other grains and can be a mix of different whiskies. Single malts, on the other hand, must be made from 100% malted barley, produced at a single distillery, and distilled using a traditional copper pot still.But here\u2019s one of the coolest things about the story of Scotch: Even though most bars and home drinkers brag about their expensive single malt (non-blended) Scotch, the blended stuff has been popular for a really long time. And you know where that started? Grocery stores. That\u2019s right. Think about the bulk section at the store. Now think about how great it would be if there were barrels of whisky there. Because distilleries weren\u2019t bottling their products (glass wasn\u2019t cheap back then), Scots bought whisky by filling their bottle or jug at their local grocer. But something else started to happen: Grocers began blending various single malts to make a house whisky. Johnnie Walker was a grocer, and so was Dewar, among many others.Today, we\u2019re going to buy a bottle of good-quality blended Scotch and a bottle of the Scotch-based liqueur Drambuie, so you can make three great drinks for your wintry evenings. No bulk barrels or self-blending required.Photo by Laura Murray, Food Styling by Al CullitonYour Shopping ListBlended Scotch (I like the Famous Grouse)DrambuieAngostura bitters (optional)6 limes2 eggsGinger beer (spicy!)Club sodaThe PrepWe\u2019re going to lean on Drambuie\u2019s honey-sweetness and store-bought ginger beer to do what a simple syrup might normally do. All you\u2019ve got to do right now is juice four or five of those limes and you\u2019re golden.1. The Mamie TaylorPhoto by Laura Murray, Food Styling by Al CullitonIn the late nineteenth century, the rise of Broadway was inextricably linked with the cocktail boom. They essentially grew up together. Mayme Taylor was a comedic actress during the Gilded Age and this drink, though not spelled correctly, is named in her honor. The refreshing citrus-and-spice combo will make you feel like you\u2019re at a summer garden party.To make it, pour 1\u00bd oz. Scotch, \u00be oz. lime juice, and a barspoon of Drambuie into a tall glass. Add ice, top with ginger beer, and garnish with a lime wedge.2. The Rusty NailPhoto by Laura Murray, Food Styling by Al CullitonLong associated with bachelor-style postwar drinking culture, the Rusty Nail hasn\u2019t always gotten the respect it deserves. But you know what? It\u2019s a good drink, and if you like Old-Fashioneds, you\u2019ll like this. Instead of sugar or syrup, the Drambuie acts as a spiced honey syrup, and it\u2019s got booze in it, too.To make it, pour 1\u00bd oz. Scotch and \u00be oz. Drambuie into a double rocks glass. (This is my preferred ratio; some of you may prefer more or less of either, and that\u2019s okay!) Add ice and stir right in the glass for about 20 seconds. I like to garnish mine with a couple dashes of Angostura bitters, which reinforces the spice of the Drambuie. Sensing a theme here? Blended Scotch cocktails are pretty easy, no?3. The Scotch FizzPhoto by Laura Murray, Food Styling by Al CullitonThis one\u2019s an original I came up with, but it\u2019s based on one of the great classic cocktail templates: the fizz! A fizz consists of spirit, citrus, sugar (we'll use Drambuie here), and egg white, shaken to froth and chilled, and then strained into a small version of a Collins glass without ice. It's then topped with soda until the head from the egg white reaches the top of the glass. If you\u2019re a dedicated reader of this column, you\u2019ll know that we\u2019ve used egg white before. If you aren\u2019t, don\u2019t be scared\u2014it makes for an impressive and delicious drink!To make it, first separate the yolks from a couple eggs so you have some egg white to work with. For the whites, a squeeze bottle is best, but a small bowl or measuring cup is fine too. Into one of your shaker tins, combine 1\u00bd oz. Scotch, 1 oz. Drambuie, \u00be oz. lime juice, and \u00be oz. egg white. We\u2019re going to \u201cdry shake\u201d first (that means no ice), so seal the tin tightly and shake for 15 seconds, being sure to hold the two halves of the shaker together firmly. Open the shaker back up, add ice, and seal. Shake again for 15 seconds. Into a small Collins glass (8- or 9-ounce capacity), double strain the drink. (That means putting your Hawthorne strainer over the top of the shaker tin, then pouring the whole shebang through a fine mesh strainer over the glass.) Let it settle for a few seconds. Now, slowly pour in soda until the egg white head reaches the top of the glass. Let it settle for a few seconds more, then top off with more soda. Isn\u2019t it pretty?!Now that you know all about Scotch, it\u2019s time to get mixing. Nothing will entice your friends to come over on a cold winter\u2019s night more than the text \u201cI\u2019m making cocktails.\u201d But if they still won\u2019t budge, promise them you\u2019ll wear tartan while doing so.Al Culliton is a writer, bartender and consultant living in western Massachusetts.
