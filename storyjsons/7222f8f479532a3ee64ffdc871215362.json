Read all the stories here.Around 4 a.m. one August day in 1931, heiress and socialite A\u2019Lelia Walker bolted awake, startled, thinking she\u2019d lost her vision. \u201cMamie, I can\u2019t see,\u201d she said to a friend, pleading for some ice. A\u2019Lelia was staying in Long Branch, New Jersey, where she had been a guest at a birthday celebration. Just hours before she\u2019d indulged in pleasures like lobster, chocolate cake, and champagne. A doctor surmised that \u201cshe had probably suffered a stroke from too elaborate a dinner,\u201d according to the Baltimore newspaper Afro-American. A\u2019Lelia died an hour later of, in truth, a reported cerebral hemorrhage. She was just 46.From today\u2019s remove, it feels morbidly poetic that A\u2019Lelia\u2019s death was, quite literally, brought on after too extravagant a feast: In her lifetime, A\u2019Lelia made a name for herself hosting lush meals at her two Harlem residences and her mansion on the Hudson River, Villa Lewaro. Through these parties she established a public identity independent of her mother, the legendary entrepreneur Madam C.J. Walker, a poor child of formerly enslaved parents who became a titan of the Black hair-care industry and had a seven-figure net worth.A\u2019Lelia honored Black artistry at these salons. She festooned the walls with quotations and poetry from luminaries like Langston Hughes and Countee Cullen; she prominently displayed a cabinet of books by Black authors.During the fecund years of the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s, A\u2019Lelia entertained throngs of intellectuals and artists with song, dance, and foods. Pianists usually provided the soundtrack for these evenings; performers like the jazz giant Alberta Hunter and the baritone Broadway star Jules Bledsoe would enchant guests with their singing, while actresses like Fredi Washington would dance for onlookers. A\u2019Lelia\u2019s menus offered potato souffl\u00e9s, salmon mousse, and crushed strawberry ice cream. Her indefatigable spirit as the hostess led the writer Langston Hughes to dub her the \u201cJoy Goddess of the Harlem Renaissance\u201d in his 1940 autobiography The Big Sea.Many, though not all, attendees came from America\u2019s margins: They were Black, queer, sometimes both. \u201cA\u2019Lelia Walker had a wide range of friends including many artists, writers, musicians and actors as well as the circle of professional men and women who belonged to the Black middle class in Harlem, Chicago, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Atlantic City, etc.,\u201d A\u2019Lelia Bundles, her great-granddaughter and author of the forthcoming biography The Joy Goddess of Harlem: A\u2019Lelia Walker and the Harlem Renaissance (Scribner), says in an email. \u201cSome of those friends happened to be queer. They were there because she enjoyed their company and appreciated their talent.\u201dWriters and journalists now recognize A\u2019Lelia\u2019s f\u00eates as sites of queer refuge and Black joy in times of great strife for those communities. But this development is relatively recent. In the decades following her death, A\u2019Lelia routinely faced accusations from scholars that she was riding the coattails of her mother\u2019s philanthropy or that her parties were empty displays of capitalist excess. \u201cWhereas Madame Walker had been civic-minded, donating thousands of dollars to charity, A\u2019Lelia used most of her inheritance to throw lavish parties,\u201d the queer historian Eric Garber wrote in 1989. Such dismissals ignore the fact she funneled money into social service organizations, for one, but they also misread the quiet radicalism of A\u2019Lelia\u2019s project. Her parties provided a sanctuary from the violence of the era.A\u2019Lelia was born on June 6, 1885 in Vicksburg, Mississippi, as Lelia McWilliams\u2014the A\u2019 would come later, in 1922, for reasons unknown\u2014when her mother was just 17. Her father, Moses McWilliams, would die just three years later, leaving her mother to raise A\u2019Lelia alone. She came of age in St. Louis, near where her mother\u2019s siblings lived. The elder Walker toiled away as a washerwoman, determined not to let her daughter suffer the same cruelties of her impoverished childhood.Her mother would build a hair-care business from the ground up in the years that followed, and A\u2019Lelia spent much of her time helping maintain it. The two women were close, almost suffocatingly so, according to Bundles\u2019 2001 biography of the elder Walker, On Her Own Ground (which inspired the fictionalized 2020 Netflix miniseries Self-Made). As she grew into adulthood, A\u2019Lelia sometimes felt that her mother\u2019s love hindered her, even when she married and adopted a daughter of her own.A\u2019Lelia\u2019s parties gave her the autonomy she craved. As early as 1914, just after putting down her roots in Harlem, she was hosting dinner soir\u00e9es with composers, magazine publishers, and realtors in her West 136th Street townhouse. Frequently hiring Black caterers, according to Bundles, A\u2019Lelia would serve delicacies like watercress sandwiches, boned capon, and orange cake. As these parties grew in size, her personality became a draw, with a 1916 Indianapolis World piece characterizing her as a \u201cgenius\u201d whose presence \u201cpermeates the atmosphere.\u201d A\u2019Lelia cut a striking figure, often sheathing her head in turbans that made her look taller than her 5'9\" frame.What guided these parties was a sense of freedom. \u200b\u200b\u201cThere was men and women, women and women, and men and men, and everyone did whatever they wanted to do.\u201dOnly on occasion would the mask slip, revealing the private distress A\u2019Lelia carried with her. In his autobiography, her friend Hughes would recount a time when, mid-party, A\u2019Lelia started to cry about an ex-husband, retreating to her room and cradling a gold shoehorn her former lover had left her with. \u201cThe only thing I have left that he gave me,\u201d she reportedly said. \u201cIt\u2019s all I have left of him!\u201dHer mother\u2019s death in 1919 made her sink into grief, but her parties gave her purpose. Though A\u2019Lelia became the Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company\u2019s president after that occurrence, she wanted to stand on her own. She held vibrant affairs throughout the 1920s, when the Harlem Renaissance was in full bloom. Specifics mattered to A\u2019Lelia\u2014especially the food. \u201cA\u2019Lelia Walker was very intentional about preparing the details of her parties,\u201d Bundles says. \u201cThe menus. The caterers. The guest lists. The invitations.\u201d The designs of some of these invitations were spare but evocative: \u201cMay your lives be filled with music,\u201d one fold-out invitation for a 1923 Christmas dinner reads, the front of the card bearing the words \u201cMerrie Xmas\u201d in elegant typeface. The menu for that evening mentions venison, bacon, and filet mignon; an October 1926 luncheon reportedly contained clam broth, lobster, and alligator pear (that is, avocado) salad.In 1927, A\u2019Lelia attempted to formalize her functions by establishing a membership club called the Dark Tower. One menu reveals the wealth of foods she charged for: cream of tomato or celery soup for $0.25; coconut cake for $0.30; cream cheese, guava jelly, and toasted crackers for $0.75. On these evenings, she\u2019d invite artists to her townhouse to dance, play cards, or just talk, as the writer William Pickens observed in a 1928 account in the New York Amsterdam News. \u201cIt matters not to what \u201crace\u201d one belongs, provided he belongs to the human race and can behave humanly,\u201d Pickens, who was Black, wrote. But A\u2019Lelia honored Black artistry at these salons. She festooned the walls with quotations and poetry from luminaries like the aforementioned Hughes and Countee Cullen; she prominently displayed a cabinet of books by Black authors, a symbolic gesture that asserted the inherent worth of this literature.The Dark Tower closed down a year later, too pricey for a consistent crowd to attend. \u201cHaving no talent or gift, but a love and keen appreciation for art, The Dark Tower was my contribution,\u201d A\u2019Lelia wrote to guests in October 1928 when she shut its doors. But other parties continued there and at A\u2019Lelia\u2019s other residences. She often handed out hundreds more invites than she could accommodate. Her salons, colloquially called \u201cat homes,\u201d attracted esteemed figures like the actor Paul Robeson, the writer Zora Neale Hurston, and the photographer Carl Van Vechten. What guided these parties was a sense of freedom. \u200b\u200b\u201cThere was men and women, women and women, and men and men, and everyone did whatever they wanted to do,\u201d one frequent attendee, Mabel Hampton, said in 1983.But calamities beyond A\u2019Lelia\u2019s control extinguished her light. The 1929 stock market crash put a dent in the Walker Company\u2019s sales, forcing her to put Villa Lewaro on the market and rent out her Harlem townhouse. Her parties continued\u2014one March 1931 afternoon featuring the opera singer Minto Cato was \u201ctoo swell for words,\u201d per Afro-American\u2014but A\u2019Lelia reportedly grew despondent over her finances. She suffered from physical ailments too: Effects from a 1924 stroke lingered, and her climbing blood pressure led to medical warnings about her eating that she allegedly failed to heed. Her funeral drew thousands. Just like her parties, the invitations far outnumbered what the venue could hold.In spite of such public affection, vocal critics of A\u2019Lelia emerged in the years after her death. One paper\u2019s account of her funeral observed the presence of her ill-wishers who \u201csmiled scornfully\u201d when the topic of her \u201csocial leadership\u201d came up, as \u201cone knew that they were thinking of other women whose brilliantly intellectual qualities, highly polished and superficial culture, so-called background, or supposedly great family inheritance, perhaps better qualified them to be society leaders.\u201d Though it is unclear whether those detractors came from within her community or outside of it, some Black writers would openly pillory her in the years to come. The journalist Roi Ottley pegged her with the pejorative \u201cMahogany Millionairess\u201d in 1943, chiding her for spending money \u201crecklessly.\u201d Others have claimed that she had a mere seven-minute attention span, which Bundles says \u201c\u200b\u200bdoes not scan with what I have learned after decades of research or with what her friends conveyed to me when I interviewed them in the 1980s.\u201d These persistent misperceptions even extend to the food. Bundles questions the veracity of one prevalent anecdote that alleges her great-grandmother saddled white party guests with chitterlings and bathtub gin while her Black guests enjoyed champagne and caviar. She says she has been unable to find any credible primary sources to support such a claim.It has taken some time for the historical record of A\u2019Lelia to be corrected through the attentive work of scholars like Bundles, whose personal connection to her subject (and namesake) has fueled her mission to represent the story in its fullness, along with amplification by journalists. A\u2019Lelia \u201cfostered joyful resistance and a sense of sanctuary from racial terror,\u201d writer Jamia Wilson posited in Refinery29. These days it might be easier to see A\u2019Lelia as one of American history\u2019s numerous Black women scrutinized and censured for accruing wealth in a system designed to limit their material possibilities. Looking at A\u2019Lelia\u2019s work in this more appreciative light, then, makes the significance of her get-togethers even clearer. She provided a haven against anti-Black racism and homophobia: ills that continue to afflict the country today. The dinner party continues to hold unique power for Americans who live outside the dominant culture, seeking a reprieve from the world\u2019s violence.But the reason why A\u2019Lelia hosted these parties at all might be even simpler. \u201cWith all of this big house and a nice income and above all a wonderful mother, I am so alone in the world,\u201d A\u2019Lelia once despaired.\u200b For a time, she built a world where she, and others, could feel less alone.Explore Bon App\u00e9titDinner PartiesPartiesCultureLifestyleRecipes you want to make.
