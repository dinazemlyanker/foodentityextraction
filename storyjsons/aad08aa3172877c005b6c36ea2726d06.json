Well you can, especially when they\u2019re thinly sliced and tossed in a tangy, mustardy vinaigrette. Add a mess of kale, salty cheese, sweet-tart apple, and crunchy seeds, and you get a borderline addictive salad.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I generally add a splash of apple cider vinegar to the dressing, as per another reviewer\u2019s suggestion, and I put the garlic through a press instead of grating it, but otherwise follow the recipe exactly most of the time (though at various times I have made this without Brussels sprouts, with curly kale, with Fuji and Gala apples. Always delicious).\n\nA half recipe is a nice lunch for two; this is filling enough that we don\u2019t feel we need to have bread or soup along with.\n\nHighly recommend!Anonymous2/1/2022Unbelievably good! I subbed toasted walnuts for the sunflower seeds (evan more crunch!!)and added the dried cranberries as suggested by another reviewer.\n and added I made the vinaigrette ahead- so great! I actually weighed the brussel sprouts to try and get the correct proportions.\n\nI can't wait to make it again- as soon as I get more brussel sprouts :) Jhawkm84Oregon 1/10/2022My favorite new salad.  Made it true to the recipe but have modified it after so many times. No parmesan cheese. Bought roasted sunflower seeds for convenience.  More lemon and mustard and less oil. Added dried cranberries. Used a bag of trader Joe's cruciferous blend. Perfect and fast. This salad will keep for a day or 2.AnonymousCherry Hill NJ12/8/2021Great fall/winter salad!! Made for a Friendsgiving and everyone loved it. The acid and greens really helped cut through all the heavy thanksgiving dishes. Added some apple cider vinegar to the dressing to amp up the acid, and left out the parmesan. AnonymousFort Worth, TX11/14/2021So... I think this has the potential to be good. I found grating the garlic to be too sharp. I want to make again with modifications; just need to think about how to balance things out a bit better for my tastes.JSChicago, IL4/19/2021Delicious! I added a little tahini, full lemon juice and it is crunchy, salty and nutty. Bees in the Gardenmidcoast Maine 3/28/2021My favorite kale salad. I prefer to shave the parm with a veg peeler. MJDallas, TX3/28/2021Love this salad - it's on my rotation! Perfect for lunches and versatile AliceToronto, Canada1/19/2021This was good, but I don't know about magical. Definitely is better dressed ahead of time and chilled in the fridge for a while, but the dressing didn't have the bite I was looking for. I may make again and up the mustard a bit, maybe add a dash of apple cider vinegar like someone else mentioned. Love the apple and toasted sunflower seed going on, but I'm the odd man out here and think the brussels would add more flavor roasted. Good base recipe, though, I'll make again and tweak.AbbyT1/6/2021Absolute perfection - we made this for thanksgiving and I made it again just now in an effort to kick into January slimming mode. Great kale salad recipe if you don't consider yourself a kale salad lover.Catherine A.Hoboken, NJ1/5/2021this recipe looks great!  I'm going to try it.  Any information about the nutrients i.e. calcium, etc.?ChristineNew Jersey1/4/2021OMG.  This is totally addictive.  I have made this salad three times in less than 2 weeks.  I can eat 1/3 of the salad at one setting--so good.JoAnnKansas City1/2/2021This recipe changed my life. NicToronto, on12/16/2020Ok this salad was delicious! Made for Thanksgiving and everyone was a huge fan. And was yummy the next day too!!EmilyAtlanta11/27/2020Absolutely delicious. Made with pre-roasted pepitas.  Next time I'll dress just a little bit lighter and throw in more of the apple. Salad sat for several hours chilled before eating and held up well. May make a second time with the rest of the Brussels Sprouts - it's that good.julesMinneapolis 11/27/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladKaleLeafy GreensVegetableBrussels SproutAppleFruitWinterQuickEasyWeeknight MealsSideGluten-FreeVegetarianRosh HashanahLunchDinnerBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
