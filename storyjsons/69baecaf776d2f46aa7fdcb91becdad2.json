Made this for dinner last night and it was great. I mixed the ricotta in instead of spooning it onto the plate and putting the salad on top, which was good. I don't think I'll be able to have panzanella without fried bread from now on. So good. AnonymousBerkeley, CA8/5/2019Hi! I made this and it was delicious but I omitted the parsley bc A: I don\u2019t think it would add/mix well with other flavors and B: based on the photo there\u2019s clearly no parsley in this. The photo looks like chives. Can you clarify for me so I make it right the next time? Thanks!
