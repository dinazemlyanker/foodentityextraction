I may have waited to long to put my fish in to steam as my rice was nearly out of water but I just added a bit extra and it steamed up just fine. Definitely agree with the other reviewers - add more seasoning. I doubled the curry powder and added some cayenne pepper and forgot to add salt to the rice while cooking but I think that would have helped. But I added it after along with a splash of soy sauce and some sambal olek. I sauteed onion, bell pep and some kale on the side and mixed that in too. Hannahrs22Tampa, FL1/13/2021Haven't made this but looking to make \u2014\u00a0I think there's a type-o: \"Talk celery --> stalk celery\" Anonymous12/3/2020Absolutely delicious! Definitely needs a generous amount of salt added both while the rice cooks and when serving. AnonymousMinnesota6/7/2020This recipe has potential, it really does. But it misses the mark and comes out kind of bland. The combination of tangy yogurt, crunchy celery and bright cilantro is a delight. A few suggested modifications:\n\n- at least double the curry in the rice\n- add .5 tsp salt to the rice\n- chop the cilantro. These stems are just awkward.\n- add the fish 5 min before your rice is finished with the initial cooking time. \n\nAnonymousChicago, IL6/7/2020Who does your proofreading?\nSee this: 1 talk celery, thinly sliced on a bias\nAnonymousMaine5/11/2020Delicious, quick, and easy. It will be easy to riff on as well. I\u2019ll definitely make this again! I left off the eggs and cilantro because I didn\u2019t have them, but the yogurt is definitely not optional.AlektrikAtlanta, GA3/8/2020Loved this dish! It was very easy to make and very flavorful. As noted in another comment, I did use more salt, especially when cooking the rice. I also added a some sambal olek for a bit of kick. Definitely making this again! mhdsileskyAustin, TX6/22/2019what if you only had salmon? would you cook it the same way?Anonymous10/30/2018Delicious!  Loved the tang of the yogurt coupled with the fish and cilantro.AnonymousVermont10/29/2018Yes, I would make this again BUT I would add more salt.  It was flat as is and needed something more savory.  My first thoughts were to add some soy or fish sauce or to possibly marinate/season the fish more heavily.  Never the less I loved the ease of this recipe. justyntiSan Diego10/28/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titRice and Grain BowlCodFishSeafoodRiceRice & GrainsEasyQuickWeeknight MealsMainNut-FreeGluten-FreeHealthyishSteamBreakfastLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
