I planned an entire trip around eating lunch there.By Alex BeggsApril 30, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Gustavo VivancoFacebookTwitterEmailFirst, you know nothing. There are 4,000 types of potatoes in Peru, and you\u2019ll never eat them all. You\u2019ll mistake an alpaca for a llama. You\u2019ll read a 500-page book about the Incas and still feel clueless. You can pack so tightly, so deliberately, for every meal and hike and that rainy trek to Machu Picchu, and forget underwear. You might speak high school Spanish, but do you speak Quechua? If you keep in mind how little you know, you can begin to understand Mil, the ambitious restaurant-slash-food-lab from Virgilio Marti\u0301nez, Pia Leo\u0301n, and Malena Marti\u0301nez, 12,000 feet up in the clouds of the Andes mountains. You also have to get there.Android Roy loves the The Red Hot Chili Peppers. We\u2019re listening to Californication as we drive to Mil, a 90-minute journey from where I\u2019m staying in Cusco. The jams are blasting from a \u201990s playlist that Roy has open on his Android attached to the A/C vent. (Android Roy is the name of his in-car WiFi, and it becomes his and my inside joke.) Roy has kind eyes and an unfortunate soul patch\u2013goatee combo, but I can\u2019t fault a man for that. We bond over the universal language of rock. (\u201cTe gusta Oasis?\u201d \u201cMe gusta.\u201d) When Nirvana comes on, Roy confirms the death of Kurt Cobain by using his finger gun to blow his brains out. The car slows when we get stuck behind a Rico Pollo truck advertising frozen chicken nuggets and spewing black smoke.Virgilio Marti\u0301nez\nPhoto by Jake LindemanOver my weeklong trip to the Sacred Valley of Peru, Roy takes me to all the sights because I\u2019m too anxious to drive, especially on these twisting narrow roads. We go to the Maras salt mines, to the ruins at Ollantaytambo, to the textile town of Chinchero, where a jaded weaver at a tourist market smashes a beetle in her palm, mixes its guts with lime juice, and smears this vibrant red lip stain haphazardly on her lips. And we drive twice from Cusco to Mil. I\u2019ve never planned an entire vacation around one restaurant. It feels, because it is, extravagant. I\u2019m not \u201cused to [dining] in restaurants with Michelin stars,\u201d as one TripAdvisor review for Mil reads, nor have I \u201cbeen to over 20 of the top 50 restaurants in the world,\u201d as another reads. I\u2019m on assignment, chasing a tip from an ex-coworker who had one of the best meals of her life at Mil, amid restaurant-industry chatter that this place would surely make the list of Latin America\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants in 2019.Roy and I pass women selling bushels of quinoa and oblong Andean tomatoes. We pass the construction site of a controversial airport that could transform the remote area. Mostly we pass by hundreds of dogs. The Sacred Valley is overrun with mangy strays who wait by cafe\u0301s for stale empanadas. Roy does not approve but tells me the politicians say they\u2019re doing something about it. I ponder what that means as the air outside gets thinner.Roy drops me off in the gravelly parking lot at Mil. I spot Virgilio Marti\u0301nez in the yard, standing casually in what happens to be exactly where a cinematographer would pose him for the opening shot of a movie: at the breathtaking (not an altitude joke) overlook onto the ruins of Moray, a stadium of concentric circles that stack upward. These are Inca terraces\u2014shelves built into a mountainside\u2014that most archaeologists theorize Incan priests and scientists used to study crops in different conditions. I don\u2019t want to desecrate it with adjectives, but the sight of it makes me feel utterly inconsequential. Virgilio watches me take it in with an expression of pride and bemusement. He\u2019s wearing skinny black jeans and a T-shirt with a cherry blossom print on the pocket, picked up in a Japanese airport. He shrugs. Some things are inconsequential.Virgilio\u2014the g in his name is pronounced with a heat that could fog up a bus window\u2014is famous for his Lima restaurant Central, where each dish represents one of the country\u2019s diverse ecosystems, the menu arranged in ascending altitude. Virgilio was born in Lima, but no story of his life is complete without mentioning his early career as a semipro skateboarder, which ended in broken bones/dreams. He left Lima for Le Cordon Bleu in Ottawa and took his first kitchen job flipping crepes and shucking oysters, which, to young Virgilio, was as thrilling as a half-pipe. From the late \u201990s through the early 2000s, he worked the line in fine-dining joints around the world, including Lute\u0300ce in New York, Can Fabes in Spain. At home in Peru, terrorism raged in the mountains; a majority of the people killed were farmers.A cactus-and-oca-root dessert\nPhoto by Gustavo VivancoAfter feeling frustrated cooking Peruvian food in Spain, where he couldn\u2019t easily source his country\u2019s ingredients, Virgilio came back. He traveled to every corner of Peru, home to nearly 100 microclimates (e.g., the sunny side of a mountain versus the shadow of an Inca terrace). Central opened in 2008 with a menu that Virgilio later realized was all over the place, overinfluenced by his travels, his ambition. He cut out the dishes that felt plucked from France or Singapore. Now everything that touches your lips comes from Peru, even if you kiss the table.Central hit No. 4 on the World\u2019s 50 Best List in 2015. In 2016, Netflix called. In an episode of Chef \u2019s Table, Virgilio stars as the poetic and patriotic forager, an obsessive (which he is), hunched over beads of algae he\u2019s eager to experiment with. During the filming he\u2019d just begun plans for Mil, which opened in February 2018. The restaurant would follow Central\u2019s Peruvian ethos, focusing on the food of the Andes, grown on a farm on the property with the collaboration of the two neighboring communities: Kacllaraccay and Mullaka\u2019s Misminay. Sixty percent of Mil\u2019s space would be dedicated to Mater Iniciativa, the restaurant group\u2019s research arm.Because it takes diners, and staff, more than an hour\u2019s drive to get to Mil, the restaurant serves only lunch, for up to 35 people. Every meal begins with a tour of the Mater Iniciativa offices. There\u2019s a display table with a handful of varieties of local corn, each a different color and kernel size. We meet the \u201cpotato whisperer,\u201d Manuel Choqque, who shows us a gradation of purple potatoes that increase in nutrients as their hue deepens. Manuel is currently performing plant sex moves that will merge a tomato and a potato (!!how!!). Then we walk through the open-air courtyard, past the bathrooms where I\u2019ll wash my hands with coins of coffee soap, and into the dining room.The first time I visit Mil, lunch is a collaboration with three other Latin American chefs, something to do with Belmond hotels. It draws a crowd of chef-worshipping international-food-influencer types (cough, World\u2019s 50 Best voters). Instead of sitting down at the table, one diner roams the place taking 900 photos, while a dude in shorts sketches and then paints every dish at the table. The energy is high and schmoozy. Virgilio chews coca leaves in the side of his mouth and zooms around checking on diners, staff, the guest chefs; he walks with a forward tilt, as if still on a skateboard.Resident pup Oca Lucia patrols the window\nPhoto by Jake LindemanBut when I return the next day, there\u2019s a quiet, monastic feeling in the dining room. One wall displays a yarn hanging; there\u2019s a fireplace full of twigs. Futuristic spa music plays, but it soaks into the background. Wide windows look out onto the mountains, while an interior glass wall lines the inner courtyard. I can turn my head and see a fluffy white dog named Oca Lucia napping in a sunny windowsill on one side of the building and gray rain clouds forming behind the mountains on the other.The service staff flank the walls like chaperones. Water is refilled an inch at a time. When you step out to use the bathroom, napkins are folded and positioned to drape off the table\u2019s edge. If there\u2019s a draft, a woolen blanket is brought for your shoulders. It takes all my willpower not to sigh, laugh, or die in my seat when a flea-size cube of red chile is tweezed off the table in front of me.There are eight altitude-climbing courses, known as \u201cmoments.\u201d Each re-creates an ecosystem in the Andes, where there are intense freezing winds, blistering sun, and soil-drenching rain. The overriding character of the food\u2014and the people\u2014of the Andes is resilience. Which leads me to the first \u201cmoment\u201d: Preservacio\u0301n.A coca pancake filled with fava beans\nPhoto by Jake Lindeman\u201cWe\u2019re beginnin\u2019 with chun\u0303o,\u201d introduces one of the servers, Jessica, whose North Carolina accent intertwangs with her fluent, fluttering Spanish. (Jessica visited Peru when she was younger and fell in love with it, adopted it as her home. She also teaches the Mil team English, which might mean they\u2019ll all end up speaking with a deep Southern accent.) When I was decoding the menu later with the glossary in the Central cookbook, I read that chun\u0303o can translate from Quechua as \u201cpotatoes passed from ice to the sun\u201d\u2014a reference to the process of naturally freeze-drying potatoes outside until they turn into prehistoric-looking white rocks. Chun\u0303o is the ultimate storage crop: They can last up to 15 years. Preservacio\u0301n is an upward-sloping snackscape: spongy green coca bread (coca is the herb that kept me from altitude sickness but also yes, what cocaine is made from) filled with fava bean pure\u0301e, tie-dye-pink elderberry butter, sachatomate uchucuta (chile sauce), two mochi-like cubes of caramelized corn cakes, and two airy chun\u0303o chips. If I were to write a master\u2019s thesis on it, I\u2019d say: The contrast of this ancient potato against the straight-from-out-that-window fava bean was a comment on time, on fortitude versus fragility. But yeah, the chips were so good.While the chun\u0303o has held on for all of these years, other Peruvian \u201cproducts\u201d\u2014the Mater team\u2019s term for crops\u2014aren\u2019t so hardy. A small group of biologists, botanists, and anthropologists at Mater catalog indigenous Peruvian products, documenting the culinary use and cultural context of every herb and tuber. They work with farmers to revive those at risk of extinction and aim to introduce as many as possible to a wider audience. So far they\u2019ve recorded more than 300 ingredients, at least 285 of which are on the menu at Virgilio\u2019s restaurants.Malena Marti\u0301nez\nPhoto by Jake LindemanVirgilio\u2019s sister Malena oversees Mater, as well as the management of his restaurants (three in Lima including a cocktail bar, plus Mil). While Virgilio was skateboarding, Malena went to medical school in California. When I meet her in Lima, the outline of 30 Peruvian ingredients for an upcoming book is listed in marker on one of the glass walls in her office. Staffers keep popping in to ask her questions. Malena has all the answers. \u201cShe\u2019s the library\u2014or the bible,\u201d one of the cooks later tells me.It\u2019s clear that Malena\u2019s levelheaded leadership amid Virgilio\u2019s buzzy hyperactivity is what keeps these restaurants\u2014and Virgilio himself\u2014from combusting. She is organized, cautious; meanwhile, he admits, \u201cSometimes I go blind into places.\u201d He told me the two have meetings every 40 minutes, maybe just to talk about life. When the servers can identify every edible flower petal on the plate, it\u2019s Malena, the fount of knowledge, behind them. But when food conferences want to talk about Mater, they invite Virgilio. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t receive the credit,\u201d he told me, \u201cbecause people prefer to see a chef. I feel uncomfortable with that.\u201dIt arrives at the table, a beautiful rock. It\u2019s a Mil version of the huatia, an earthen oven usually saved for harvest celebrations. Traditionally, whatever is cooking inside (potatoes and fava beans, let\u2019s say) gets buried in the soil it grew in. The stones collapse around them, creating a natural pressure cooker. At Mil, a single carved stone is the oven, and inside are two tiny potatoes, served with two sauces: a vibrant, acidic tomato-chile uchucuta and a green, grassy herbal chincho dip. Two potatoes. Out of 4,000.The dining room at Mil.\nPhoto by Jake LindemanThe twin-brother chefs Luis and Carlos Valderrama carry out Virgilio\u2019s visions at Mil when he\u2019s in Lima. Virgilio lives above Central with his wife, Pia Leo\u0301n\u2014the chef of the slightly more casual Kjolle, which is also in the building\u2014and their son, Cristo\u0301bal. After years of working at Central, the twins can translate Virgilio\u2019s cravings for new dishes, ideas that fly into his brain like snippets of last night\u2019s dream. They do a hilarious impression of him: \u201cI\u2019m thinking about jelly. Maybe, in a natural way. Think about a way to give me this texture, okay?\u201d \u201cPerfect, chef!\u201dLuis and Carlos explore Andean ingredients as they come into season with the help of Santiago Pillco, one of the leaders of the local communities, who oversees the work on the farm. Santiago wears a Mater Iniciativa vest and a tan hat. I met him outside on my first day at Mil. \u201cHow did you hear of me?\u201d he asked me. \u201cSome guy named Virgilio mentioned you,\u201d I said. \u201cWho\u2019s Virgilio?\u201d Santiago giggled. Pure grandpa stuff. Virgilio is \u201clike a brother,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to share how I work with [the chefs at Mil] and then share the knowledge of those ingredients with the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we weren\u2019t sharing, we\u2019re losing our identity.\u201d He gestured toward the mountain behind us, where his wife, Seferina, was in the fields with a botanical researcher.Some of those 4,000 potato varieties\nPhoto by Gustavo VivancoIt wasn\u2019t always this rosy utopia. Before Mil, the space was once used to raise vicun\u0303as, a relative of the llama (\u201cThey all died or something,\u201d per Virgilio). A restaurant group bought it, but nothing ever took hold. It was rented out for parties. Rich people came and went and made a lot of noise, fueling distrust in the communities. \u201cI\u2019m considered a white guy here,\u201d Virgilio says. \u201cThese people have been cheated for years. Their identity, their value\u2014 everything was trying to be erased.\u201d He\u2019s referring to terrorism but also to the rise of industrialized food, which cut the demand for kiwicha and other crops we\u2019d stamp \u201cheirloom.\u201dAnthropologist Francesco D\u2019Angelo, left, and community leader Santiago Pillco in the fields outside Mil\nPhoto by Jake LindemanTo strengthen the connection with its neighbors, Mater hired a Peruvian anthropologist, Francesco D\u2019Angelo. Francesco is 27, with waist-length dreads and a grad student\u2019s bright-eyed idealism. He\u2019s hyper and excitable like Virgilio but more social and outgoing, whereas Virgilio can get lost inside his own head. Francesco spent nine months getting to know everyone, how their society functions. He can point to distant fields and tell you whose farm is whose and what they\u2019re growing. One of the most important things they learned about the Andean people, Malena told me, was that \u201cthe hierarchy is not well-defined, but they understand that they are all valuable, and that each person has a function.\u201d That horizontal structure dictated how Mater organized Mil, where the farmers work on a rotary system, taking turns in the fields, and earn 50 percent of the harvest.Andean cheese in Diversidad de Maiz (Diversity of Corn)\nPhoto by Jake LindemanAround an hour in to this $165 eight-course lunch, we reach the halfway point of the menu: Diversidad de Maiz. It\u2019s an homage to the farmers\u2019 midday meal: a few bites of grilled, squeaky, Halloumi-like Andean cheese; a bowl of big bursting-sweet corn kernels; green herb sauce; and pink, yellow, and purple corn chips to scoop everything up with. Every bite, every kernel, is bonkers. I wonder if my fellow diners, including a couple with their faces painted for some reason, are writing their TripAdvisor reviews and Instagram captions in their heads yet. I wonder what the people who grow this chullpi (yellow corn) think of this dish. Francesco laughs when he remembers how Virgilio cooked the Mil menu for the communities before the restaurant opened, and only half would try the lamb tartare (raw meat, are you crazy?) or the frozen dessert (too cold!). But Nery Amau, one of the service staff whose parents own a farm nearby, tells me Diversidad de Maiz is her favorite dish.There are other dishes I won\u2019t swoon over in such detail but that I\u2019ll never forget. Shreddy pork belly. Dense tarwi (bean flour) bread that looks like a small cake but is as heavy as a paperweight in my hand. A crispy salad with green caviar bubbles of cushuro, an algae found in high-altitude lakes or ponds, flavorless but fascinating. A supremely fresh lamb tartare in which I can taste every muscle bead. That\u2019s followed by a shot of mata cuy, which means \u201ckill the guinea pig\u201d and is a botanical-infused sugarcane liquor to settle the stomach after a meaty meal. After lunch I have the best hot chocolate of my life. The silky liquid against the craggy stoneware mug is a textural mindf*#%.Inside the chocolate lab at Mil\nPhoto by Jake LindemanOn my way out, I exit through Mater\u2019s offices and pick up a few Mil chocolate bars from the store. The staff is boxing everything up for two weeks of vacation, during which a group of them will go to Quillabamba, a town north of Cusco, to learn more about cacao. Others will travel to the jungle of Puerto Maldonado, where Virgilio is plotting his next restaurant. No one will sit still. Except maybe me. I immediately fall asleep in the back seat during our commute to Cusco. Mercifully, Roy turns down the Nickelback.My last two days in the Sacred Valley, I climb the steep and marvelous ruins of Ollantaytambo, once an Incan emperor\u2019s estate, and visit Machu Picchu in the pouring rain. I think about that Yale guy who \u201cdiscovered\u201d it even though there were farmers living there the whole time. As with the site at Moray, no one knows exactly what Machu Picchu was. They dust the fossils and x-ray old bones. The consensus is that Machu Picchu served as a luxury resort town for the royals and the richie rich (the higher you are to the sun, the higher to the gods), until something suddenly drove them away. A drought? The intricate feat of stonework was abandoned. A tourist in a tube top takes a selfie in the low-hanging clouds, and I wonder what the hell happened here. I\u2019d like to know, just a little bit more.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsTravelPeruvianRead MorecultureStop Telling Me To Travel Like a Local, Okay?By Mari UyeharacultureEating My Way Through Atlanta, I Learned It\u2019s Much More Than Black and WhiteBy Rembert BrowneRecipes you want to make.
