Not for big game in the traditional sense, but for bottles of rarified vino, which today has lured her from Los Angeles to Canada\u2019s lush Niagara Region. A longtime sommelier, Ragovin has honed her palate to seek out the distinctive and uncommon\u2014wines that convey a point of view, a place in time.\u201cI\u2019m always inspired by small family vineyards that make wine the local people are proud of,\u201d Ragovin muses from the passenger seat of a rented Jeep. She returns her gaze to the window, through which a mesmerizing display of thick, curled grapevines flick past in neat rows that stretch to the horizon. \u201cYou won\u2019t find out the nuance of that if you don\u2019t come.\u201dHer plan is to unearth gems within the area\u2019s still nascent wine scene; perhaps she\u2019ll find vintages to pour in her all-day cafe All Time, or to feature in her highly curated online bottle shop Pour This, which offers rare and highly sought-after wines you won\u2019t find in your average liquor store. The air, cool and moist, is full of possibilities.Niagara\u2019s unique geology and climate have long stoked Ragovin\u2019s curiosity about the area, which has an agricultural heritage going back centuries. For years now, she\u2019s heard tales of the area\u2019s temperate climate, where summers aren\u2019t too hot and winters aren\u2019t too cold. The year-round rainfall is especially kind to agriculture, and true to form, it\u2019s been raining off and on since early this morning. Indeed, puddles fill the vine-filled countryside.Farmers have grown fruits like peaches, cherries, plums, and pears here since before anyone can remember, Ragovin says, but grapes have dominated the scenery since the 1980s. Thanks to the natural erosion that\u2019s carved the landscape over a millennia\u2014the same geological phenomenon that created Niagara Falls, she notes\u2014the soil here is wonderfully rich and fantastically varied, with pockets of different minerals and nutrients in each field. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect for growing grapes that burst with character and originality,\u201d Ragovin says.Today promises to be action-packed. We plan to hit up six wineries in a single day, each chosen for its individual way of expressing the Niagara Region in a glass. That may be through the grapes it chooses, the types of wine it makes, or its winemaking methods, Ragovin says. Even the personalities of the winemaker him or herself can affect one\u2019s perception of a wine.The car comes to a halt. First up is Megalomaniac, which rises magnificently above the 80 acres of vines that surround it. \u201cYou can tell this isn\u2019t a scrappy operation,\u201d Ragovin says, eyeing the fields. The varieties of grapes grown here are ones we\u2019ll see all day long: Riesling, Pinot Noir, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Chardonnay. They\u2019re Old World grapes that have proven themselves here in the New World, and in the Niagara Region in particular.We\u2019re met by the winery\u2019s founder, John Howard. \u201cOn a clear day, you can see the spray coming off Niagara Falls from the second-floor patio,\u201d Howard tells us as we enter a chandelier-dotted tasting room. The name of the operation, he continues, is meant to poke fun at the more sober-faced, inward-facing types prevalent in the wine industry. In contrast, Megalomaniac gives its wine fun names like Selfie, Narcissist, Bigmouth, and Bravado. But don\u2019t mistake playfulness for frivolity, Howard cautions. \u201cWe take our vineyards and our wine very seriously,\u201d he says. The vineyard\u2019s winemaker S\u00e9bastien Jacquey appears; he pours several vintages, including a 2016 \u201cFrank\u201d Cabernet Franc.\u201cI think Cab Franc does really well in the Niagara Region, based on the wine and the soil,\u201d Ragovin says between sips. \u201cWith Cab Franc, there\u2019s an earthy complexity that lends notes of smoke and pepper and wet rocks,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to witness the focus on that grape,\" she explains. \"I think Megalomaniac represents an affordable, accessible starting point for most people.\u201dNext up is Hidden Bench, a short drive away through winding vineyards, orchards, and rolling fields. Owner and winemaker Harald Thiel runs out to meet us in front of the main building, a handsome, green-roofed country house lined with dark, weathered wood. The whole operation spans 84 green acres and is certified organic, Thiel says. It\u2019s also heated and cooled with environmentally friendly geothermal energy, and a massive solar panel helps reduce the winery's reliance on the electrical grid.\u201cWe\u2019re also experimenting with natural wines,\u201d Thiel tells us with a wide grin, pointing toward a pair of hulking wine-filled concrete \u201ceggs,\u201d which have grown in popularity in the nature winemaking world. In the tasting room, we sample the Estate Riesling, which packs a floral nose with notes of white peach, orange rind, and wet stone. There\u2019s a major Austrian influence at play; Thiel\u2019s mother is Austrian, and he speaks fluent German.\u201cThe Riesling\u2019s juicy and fresh on the palate,\u201d Ragovin says as we leave. \u201cThey just tasted really true to what they were, really focused and pure and unmanipulated.\u201d The eggs were encouraging, too, she adds, explaining that the ovular shape is thought to create a continuous flow of wine within the vessel, naturally producing a more homogenous liquid. \u201cHis approach was rooted in tradition and he wasn't trying to be too experimental, but he was open-minded, which I thought was cool.\u201dWe pile in the car and head to Thirty Bench, our halfway point for the day. The winemaker, Emma Garner, meets us out in the vines. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s about listening to what the grapes have to say,\u201d Garner tells us. Minimal intervention is key, she continues, and creating a tantalizing wine is \u201cabout that balance between art and science.\u201d In the light-filled tasting room, which looks out onto verdant fields, we sample an exquisite, fruit-forward Cabernet Franc with just the right amount of dryness.\u201cTheir Cab Franc was so impressive to me,\u201d Ragovin says on our way out. \u201cIt was developed and thoughtfully made. It tasted very Niagara. Just a nice drinking wine.\u201dWe soldier on to Cave Spring Cellars, which is nestled in a historic winery building in the quaint village of Jordan. The structure dates back to 1871, making it the oldest functioning wine cellar in Ontario. Cave Spring Cellars itself plays a significant role in local history: More than three decades ago, its founders helped to pioneer the cultivation of noble European grape varietals on the Niagara Peninsula.Winemaker Angelo Pavan and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Gabriel Demarco, join us with bottles in hand. \u201cWe\u2019re cutting back on the number of varieties we work with, we\u2019re not expanding,\u201d Pavan says. The idea, he continues, is to hone in on a few grapes and guide them toward perfection. \u201cWe make sparkling wine as good as anywhere in the world, with the exception of Champagne in France because they have all that history,\u201d he says, eyes bright. \u201cBut we\u2019ll catch up.\u201d Ragovin raises a glass of 2009 Blanc de Blancs CSV to her lips, and nods with approval.\u201cThe wine was clean and thoughtfully made,\u201d she says as we head back to the car. \u201cIt just tasted good, and it wasn\u2019t manipulated and overproduced.\u201d It\u2019s encouraging to see younger winemakers like Demarco joining the fray, too, she adds. \u201cIt represents a new generation of good winemaking,\u201d Ragovin says.Back in the Jeep, we follow a mud-packed road to Pearl Morissette, the imaginative outfit from non-interventionist winemaker Fran\u00e7ois Morissette. Its fields go as far as the eye can see here, with creeping vines in one direction and pastures dotted with cows, sheep, and chickens in the other. The twinkling sound of birdcalls permeates the air, punctuated by loud cannon booms that echo across the landscape.\u201cIt\u2019s a recording of birds in distress, to keep birds out,\u201d explains Svetlana Atcheva, a former Toronto-based sommelier who\u2019s since become Morissette\u2019s collaborator. The booms scare away other predators, protecting the grapes without forcing the winery to use harsh chemicals. It\u2019s reflective of the overall ethos at work at Pearl Morissette, where traditional winemaking methods are more evocative of a farmhouse than a chateau.\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to work with something living,\u201d Morissette says, stepping out from behind a hulking fermentation vat. Using natural yeasts and as little added sulfur as possible results in wines that are funky and playful, he says. We sample a handful of still-in-the-works vintages: complex Chardonnays, Rieslings, and others.There is no tasting room at Pearl Morissette, but those who want to taste the wines near where they were made can sample them at the on-site restaurant. Dinner here means a sprawling multicourse meal in a modern farmhouse setting; the airy dining room is hemmed in by glass walls on either side and finely burnished wooden floors are made with planks culled from the 200-year-old barn that once stood on the premises. The seasonal French menu changes constantly, but is always inspired by local ingredients, from rare bluecap and lobster mushrooms to petite wild pigeons.\u201cFrancois represents the future in winemaking to me, and he has a very irreverent approach,\u201d Ragovin says, clearly impressed. \u201cHe\u2019s not making wine for the masses. He\u2019s making wine with a higher goal in mind, which is to express a place and stay out of the way, but guide it in the best possible way. I find it noble and sort of altruistic.\u201dIt\u2019s late afternoon as we depart, and the sky threatens rain. We step inside our final destination, Big Head, just as a sudden downpour begins to pelt the warehouse-like space\u2019s metal roof with furious intensity. We\u2019ll be here for awhile. Good thing that Jakub Lipinski, the head of operations and the son of Big Head\u2019s head winemaker Andrzej Lipinski, has plenty of wine for us to try.\u201cDad and I, we butt heads, but it\u2019s never violent,\u201d the younger Lipinski says with a laugh. The pair have markedly different wine philosophies; Andrzej favors big and bold flavors, while Jakub goes for profiles that are more complex and unconventional. Jakub is the guiding force behind the winery\u2019s latest Syrah, a wild fermented wine packing notes of black pepper and smoked meat. It\u2019s something of an \u201cacquired taste,\u201d he admits, but his father is on board.\u201cIt\u2019s my first time getting involved in the winemaking,\u201d he says. \u201cI need something dirty and funky to get my brain going. For me, that\u2019s beautiful.\u201dRagovin sips, and her eyes brighten. \u201cHow do I get a case of it?\u201d\u201cJust leave me your address,\u201d Lipinski replies, smiling.Ragovin steps outside, her tour complete. The sky is clear for the first time today, and paddles soak up the last of the late afternoon sunshine. \u201cFor such a young region, I think there\u2019s more going on here than even I expected,\u201d she says, piling into the car one last time. Interesting things, particularly at Pearl Morissette and Big Head, where an emphasis on natural fermentation\u2014which relies only on yeast present in the air\u2014results in flavors that are intensely specific to this region, from dry and tangy to earthy and flinty. It\u2019s exactly what Ragovin is looking for. She\u2019s already trying to figure out how to get some of their bottles into Pour This.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of energy and a lot of pride,\u201d Ragovin continues. \u201cEveryone really wants to capture Niagara in their winemaking, as opposed to making it like the Finger Lakes or California,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s already a lot of exciting wine being made here and it\u2019s only going to get better.\u201dRecipes you want to make.
