When I\u2019m not, I tear greens. If I have a bag of washed, torn, ready-to-eat greens in my fridge, I can probably cobble together dinner even when I haven\u2019t planned it in advance or bought much in the way of groceries. Unwashed, untorn greens sit in my crisper as though they require a password that I\u2019ve long forgotten to access them. But I dole out washed, torn greens like Oprah gives out cars.I can have fried eggs with greens saut\u00e9ed in chili flakes. I can have pasta with so many greens it feels virtuous. I can make a simple salad alongside a can of good tuna. A simple salad with dumplings from the freezer. A simple salad with the piece of fish I bought in a five-minute market trip on the way home from work. I couldn\u2019t do any of that on the fly without torn greens.Which is why every time I grocery shop, I buy a bunch of sturdy greens\u2014kale and collards are particularly long-lasting. I sit down on the couch when I get home, turn on an episode of Veep (I know I\u2019m many years late on this), and tear them up. I wash them in a salad spinner, let them air dry (since I can never get them dry dry in the spinner), then stick them in a ziptop bag in the fridge. They\u2019re available whenever I need them, so I\u2019m almost always part way to dinner.This also means I eat approximately 90 percent more greens. I\u2019ll fold them into a larb or throw them into a frittata that might otherwise lack veg while yelling \u201cYou get some greens!\u201d in my best Oprah voice as I go.Wrap those greens around some spicy curried tofu:Curried Tofu WrapsIf the cooked tofu isn\u2019t as hot as you\u2019d hoped, amp it up by tucking a slice or two of Fresno chile into your wrap.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyHealthyishLeafy GreensCollard GreensKaleMeal PrepRead MoreLifestyleThese Vejibags Are Keeping My Greens So Fresh It's ScaryBy Oset BaburRecipes you want to make.
