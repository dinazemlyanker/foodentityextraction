This is a judgment-free zone because these people are my friends. If you want to fully geek out on the origin of your coffee beans, go right ahead. I might even join that conversation. When it gets to the coarseness of your coffee grounds and achieving the ideal water temperature for blooming them for your pour over\u2026well, I\u2019ll let you talk about it while I start to make my coffee. The New Yorker in me wants a decent cup of coffee, one that\u2019s delivered fast and certainly without making a fuss.For most of my adult life, I was a French press kind of guy, and usually just one cup of coffee in the morning kept me perked up for the day. But then 2020 came and I found myself drinking nearly three cups a day. I needed to retire the French press and invest in something that made a proper cup of coffee, looked chic on the kitchen counter, and again, wasn\u2019t as fussy as organizing the moving parts required to make a pour-over every time. That time can be spent on breakfast!The answer came in the form of the Chemex Ottomatic 2.0. If you\u2019re thinking, This thing looks familiar, that\u2019s because you\u2019ve probably seen parts of it before. This is the latest version of the Chemex Ottomatic, an automatic drip coffee maker that uses the same filters and iconic glass carafe as a classic Chemex pour-over setup.The difference here is that it introduces all of the aspects of an automatic drip coffee machine. Water is heated constantly in the chamber, keeping it at the optimal brewing temperature, and then it\u2019s dispersed through a nozzle that gently pulses water over the coffee grounds in a wide arc, not just a narrow drip. And the carafe is set on a heating plate that can be turned on (for when I want to brew coffee and save some for later) or off (for when I want to use the machine\u2019s iced coffee function).The Ottomatic 2.0 basically removes all of the work of a pour-over while still giving me the same honed flavors. It brews me six cups of coffee, and yes, it looks beautiful while doing it. See, it\u2019s already a better start to the new year.Mark McCartyChemex Ottomatic 2.0$350 at Zola$350 at ChemexExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendCoffeeShoppingToolsRecipes you want to make.
