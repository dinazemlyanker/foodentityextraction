It\u2019s a place that\u2019s inspired dozens of couples to get romantic over the years (official restaurant slogan: \u201cSince 1963, a Nice Place to Fall in Love\u201d), and nearly every one of the snuggle-up booths bears a plaque engraved with all the names of people who got engaged at the table. Laura Hartley Maxey, a part-time teacher, and Scott Maxey, a transportation manager in Kansas City, had seen those plaques before. Both were born nearby and grew up eating at V\u2019s with their families. But when they got engaged at the restaurant\u2014getting a plaque of their own\u2014they started a new tradition that bloomed into a multigenerational love story.Get engaged at this table and you too will get a plaque.\nPhoto by Steve PuppeLaura: We met in April of  \u201991. I was finishing my student teaching, and he was a naturalist at Burr Oak Woods Nature Center in Blue Springs.Scott: We did school programs, and she brought her second grade class out. We met on the trail and saw a dove on a little tree sitting on eggs. So she wrote and asked me to call her when the eggs hatched to let her know how the birds were doing.Laura: Smart, right?Scott: So I had to call her.Laura: It was literally three days later. Our first date was April 11, and we got engaged here at V\u2019s on June 20.Scott: Our rehearsal dinner was here, too, on October 25. The food here is consistently good.Laura: The Italian rum cake is to die for. My mom gets them for my birthday every year.Scott: When we got engaged, I did a dumb thing. I was excited and couldn\u2019t wait, so I gave her the ring at the beginning of the meal. I reached under the table and held her hand and slipped the ring on her finger. She didn\u2019t hardly eat.Laura: I couldn\u2019t eat! We had talked about getting married, but I was completely surprised. We brought his parents here three days later to tell them, which was going to blindside them, because they had just met me! So, you know, you\u2019re extremely nervous. We went through the appetizer, the salad, the dinner, the rum cake\u2026and I was like [she nudges Scott], When are you going to do it? It was a looong meal.Scott: After we got engaged, we made a point of letting V\u2019s know, and the plaque was on the wall. All we had to do was write our names down and the date.Laura: Of course, we have everyone\u2019s birthdays and graduations here. We have five girls.Scott: They\u2019re all girls.Laura: We had our oldest daughter, Ceanne, in \u201993. That summer, I started getting really sick\u2014it turned out I had colon cancer. By the time I started chemo, I had an eight-month-old, and Scott worked three jobs so I could stay home. Our big celebratory party for the end of my chemotherapy was here. And Ceanne had her college graduation party here. My mom\u2019s the emphatic instigator of parties at V\u2019s\u2014any time there\u2019s something big to celebrate, we\u2019re here. And it just continues. Our 16-year-old, Chloe, had homecoming recently, and her date said, \u201cWhere do you want to go eat?\u201d \u201cV\u2019s!\u201dScott: Like, \u201cDuh!\u201dLiz Cook is the restaurant critic for The Pitch in Kansas City.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsItalian AmericanRed SauceKansas CityRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
