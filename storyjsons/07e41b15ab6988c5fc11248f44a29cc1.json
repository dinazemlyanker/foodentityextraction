We\u2019re starting a Bon App\u00e9tit Cookbook Club. Each month, we, the editors of Bon App\u00e9tit, will choose a cookbook we\u2019re obsessed with, whether it\u2019s one that\u2019s hot off the press or the one that we\u2019ve been cooking out of for a decade. On the first Monday of each month, we\u2019ll announce that month\u2019s cookbook, give you the low-down on what makes it a must-have, and share one of our favorite recipes from it. This month\u2019s inaugural pick: Nik Sharma\u2019s Season; read about why we chose it (and get the recipe for his curry leaf popcorn chicken right this way. Then, here\u2019s how to get in on the Club:1. Find the book...from the library, from a bookstore, from your friend\u2019s house, from one of those sites on the internet that sells things, whatever it takes.2. Find friends (or internet friends)Pass the cookbook around to all of your friends and get them amped up about Cookbook Club.3. Make a dateCraft that group text, then use a Doodle poll to pick a date.4. Decide who\u2019s making whatCookbook Club is potluck-style. Get a Google Sheet going (to avoid duplicate recipes), and ask people to sign up for a recipe (or two) to make. You can also have a column for dietary restrictions, if you\u2019re nice like that.5. Prep your dishIt\u2019s the moment you\u2019ve been waiting for, the time to cook your dish. Make sure you read the recipe a few days in advance, in case you suddenly find out you were supposed to soak almonds overnight, or something like that. Choose a recipe that you know will transport well (sorry, fried calamari) and bring your own servingware. If you need to reheat something, quickly whip cream, or chop some garnishes, ask your host if you can come over a few minutes early to prep; it\u2019ll be way easier that way, trust us.6. PartyBreak out the triangular party hats, put on that playlist of good vibes, and open that Gamay you\u2019ve been chilling: It\u2019s party time. Have everyone bring a bottle of wine or the ingredients for a cocktail. (I\u2019ve heard a pitcher of these spritzes is the move.)7.
