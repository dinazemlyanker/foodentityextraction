For Cicely Tyson, who\u2019s earned two Emmys\u2014for The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman, which made her the first African American woman to win for Best Actress\u2014a Tony, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, that day has yet to arrive. \u201cEven at 96 I am still arriving,\u201d she explains in her new memoir, Just As I Am, which the New York Times calls \u201ca balm for the afflicted.\u201dIn the book, the interplay between civil rights activism and the arts is explored. So too is food. Before she married Miles Davis, the famed musician courted her with meals. \u201cHe\u2019d invite me over anytime there was cooking. First of all, that man loved to eat.
