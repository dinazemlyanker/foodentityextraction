Well, what if I told you that there was a way to bread chicken, or any kind of meat, that would absolutely not hold up against being soaked in sauce, and would in fact absorb the sauce and become a kind of soggy, bloated layer of wet breading? If you are the kind of person who bemoans a soggy sandwich or just generally can\u2019t stand the word \u201cmoist,\u201d then you may stop reading this now because our relationship was tenuous to begin with and the internet tells me that I don\u2019t need to waste emotional energy on toxic friends, and the rest of us will talk about one of my all-time favorite dishes/soggy meats soaked in delicious sauce: the Italian-American classic, Francese.Actually, first let\u2019s talk about my brother-in-law for just a second. Luca is from Castelrosso, a tiny village near Chivasso, a tiny town near Turin, a city where they make dope gelato and where Jesus\u2019 last used towel is kept. Luca is a great dude who is married to my sister, and I don\u2019t think I have ever spent any time with him without my family around. The night before he and my sister, Emily, were married, the whole village got together and cooked a giant feast during which I consumed a great deal of Birra Moretti, approximately 100 tiny sandwiches filled with tiny fish and parsley, and a whole lot of some kind of meat (I\u2019m guessing veal?) pounded out, breaded, and soaked in vinegar\u2014a dish called bistecca in carpione. About 10 years later, I am still thinking about it. Also I found out the day of the wedding that I was the best man, and when my mom said, \u201cTyler, they asked you months ago,\u201d that\u2019s when I realized that they must have asked me months ago. So I still owe Luca a bachelor party from a decade ago.The scene at Frost, a Williamsburg restaurant that\u2019s been around since 1959.\nPhoto by Cole WilsonWhy are we talking about Luca? Oh, right! Luca doesn\u2019t like Italian-American food very much. And he\u2019s never had Francese sauce! Have you ever had Francese sauce? Basically, you take a chicken breast or chunk of veal, pound it thin, dredge it in flour and then in raw egg (but you very specifically do not put it back in the flour because we are going for soggy crust, remember?), and then you saut\u00e9 the meat and add garlic, white wine, a lot of butter, and a lot of lemon juice, and you finish cooking the meat in that sauce, and oh my god I just ate my computer. At Cataldo\u2019s in Brooklyn, the Italian restaurant nearest my house, chicken Francese is served on a plate with a pile of spaghetti tossed in the Francese sauce itself, and it is heaven. At Randazzo\u2019s Clam Bar in Sheepshead Bay, a flaky white fish filet is used in place of the meat, and I know it\u2019s hyperbole to say that it lands right behind The Reformation as one of the most important moments in World History, but, well, here we are. It tastes absolutely nothing like bistecca in carpione, but something about the breading, sogginess, and acidity brings me right back to Emily and Luca\u2019s wedding.There\u2019s more to Frost than Francese (but don't skip the veal Francese).\nPhoto by Cole WilsonI wanted to see if Francese is really so good that even my stubbornly Northern Italian brother-in-law could get into it. So I took an Italian to an Italian restaurant to try to get him to like Italian food, and I realize that that seems stupid, but if you have ever met a Northern Italian, they are perhaps the least into Italian-American food of all of the people on earth. Luca\u2019s parents literally bring food when they come to visit New York City. So I took Luca and my nephew Matteo to Frost, a Williamsburg Italian restaurant that opened in 1959, to try the veal Francese (Note: It appears on the menu as \u201cveal scaloppine French style.\u201d), and it was predictably magnificent. We also had some of the best stuffed clams I have ever eaten, a giant platter of shrimp parmigiana, and we each had a side of spaghetti with tomato sauce. It was like a pre-wedding feast of over-sauced dishes, which is decidedly not a problem since Frost supplies ample amounts of bread for dipping and scooping and living life to its fullest. My nephew said that his spaghetti was \u201cawesome,\u201d and Luca said that he liked his food!!Luca\u2019s very polite, and I didn\u2019t totally believe him, so afterward I texted my sister, who pointed out that Italians do not like cheese and fish together (which is ludicrous) and thus the shrimp parmigiana was a little horrifying, and that the very notion of a side of spaghetti is a little silly (I don\u2019t see what\u2019s funny about that at all). But he did, in fact, kind of like the Francese. \u201cHe\u2019s more open-minded than his parents, but it\u2019s still hard for him. ;)\u201d my sister texted, without even hinting at an imminent divorce. Just kidding, and I\u2019m sorry about the best man thing, Luca!Tyler Kord is the chef-owner of No. 7 and No. 7 Sub in New York and the author of A Super Upsetting Cookbook About Sandwiches.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsItalian AmericanRed SauceRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
