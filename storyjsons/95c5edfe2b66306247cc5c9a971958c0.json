Food Styling by Kat BoytsovaFacebookTwitterEmailWhat\u2019s better than a good recipe? When something\u2019s so easy you don\u2019t need one. In It\u2019s That Simple, we talk you through the dishes and drinks we make with our eyes closed. Today, beet pesto.I always have one more beet than I need. Whether I\u2019m making pickled eggs, a vegetarian reuben sandwich, or a rich chocolate cake, I always end up with an extra beet rattling around in my vegetable bin. Some may blame my winter CSA, others may blame dark magic\u2014but there it sits, growing progressively smaller and more shriveled as it languishes, the Miss Havisham of root vegetables.My solution is beet pesto. It\u2019s earthy, it\u2019s savory, it normalizes eating pesto in winter. The taste is familiar\u2014your picky kid just might eat it\u2014but with unexpected depth, sweetness, and color. It freezes well, and if you have a white farmhouse sink, it will look like the scene of a bloody crime. Dramatic!Here\u2019s how to make beet pesto:Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0. Wrap your forgotten beet in tin foil\u2014no need to peel\u2014and pour in 1 Tbsp. olive oil and sprinkle with salt before sealing it tightly. Roast the beet until a paring knife easily pierces it. The cook time will depend on how large your beet is, but start checking after half an hour. Be careful as you unwrap the foil as steam will escape.Once your beet is roasted, let it sit, unwrapped, until cool enough to handle. The peel should come away easily with a little help from a paring knife. Roughly chop the peeled beet into large cubes and add to a food processor with 1 garlic clove, 2 large handfuls of basil, a couple ounces of Parmesan cheese, and salt. Blitz the ingredients, adding olive oil through the feed tube until everything comes together and looks like pesto\u2014the exact amount will vary depending on the size of your beet(s).As with any non-recipe recipe, beet pesto is endlessly customizable. Add nuts if you have them\u2014any kind will work, but I\u2019m partial to cashews or pistachios. If I have soft goat cheese on hand, I\u2019ll throw some into the food processor and watch as the mixture turns a gorgeous creamy pink. Have two sad neglected beets? Your pesto will be beet-ier. Did your Aerogarden deliver a bumper crop of basil? It\u2019ll be brighter and herbier.As for serving, toss beet pesto with pasta, swirl it into Greek yogurt, and top it with a fried egg, plate it with pretzels and crudit\u00e9s for dipping, slather it onto crostini, or spread it onto the bread of your grilled cheese sandwich. It\u2019s so versatile that you just might find yourself buying extra beets on purpose.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimplecookingRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
