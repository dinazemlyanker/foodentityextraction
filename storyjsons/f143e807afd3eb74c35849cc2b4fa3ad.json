She made sausage and egg fried rice, chopping green onions, mincing garlic, and adding a finishing touch of fish sauce. She didn\u2019t realize it then, but this would be the video that would launch her cooking career.Nguyen, also known as Twaydabae on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, now has over a million followers across her social media platforms. She\u2019s using these outlets to share the Vietnamese dishes she grew up eating and to educate her viewers on Vietnamese food, culture, and people. Her detailed recipe videos, along with her sharing the Vietnamese names of each dish she prepares on TikTok, has earned her the title of chi hai, which translates to \u201cbig sister.\u201dTikTok contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Now Nguyen is expanding her platform to pop-ups in Los Angeles, where she lives. She and I connected over Zoom to talk about how she got into cooking, how social media has become an educational tool for her, and what it\u2019s been like translating her food from the screen to IRL events.The person who inspired me to get into cooking\u2026 was Anthony Bourdain. When I came over to America from Vietnam, I didn't know a lot of English, so I watched a lot of television: SpongeBob, Food Network, and the Travel Channel. I happened to see the one episode where Bourdain went to Vietnam. I was probably like 8 or 9. The way that he talked about Vietnam\u2014he just had so much love and respect and passion for Vietnamese food, Vietnamese people. When I was living in Vietnam, it didn't feel like it was anything special. It wasn\u2019t the place to be; America was the dream. But seeing a white man talk about Vietnam the way that he did inspired me.I went to culinary school because... I didn't know the techniques. I didn't know how to use a knife or how to hold it correctly. But there wasn't ever a situation where they were teaching me how to season. I learned that from my mom. In Vietnamese culture, when you get married, you have to move in with your husband's family and take care of them and make their food. So at age 24, my mom had this responsibility. She had to remember all the meals that her mom made and just practice. My mom is not the type of mom who will teach you how to cook. When she is in the kitchen, that's her space. I wasn't really able to follow her or what she was doing, but eventually I learned by smelling and feeling, by instinct.The first recipe video I ever made was... fried rice. I put it on TikTok in March 2020, right before the pandemic, and it\u2019s still my favorite video. I was in culinary school and had extra time on the side. It was spontaneous and I wasn\u2019t expecting anything to come from it, but it ended up changing the trajectory of my career. It blew up. It got over seven million views. I knew that I had to continue making cooking content, and I stuck to making Vietnamese recipes because I felt like not a lot of people were sharing these flavors I know and love. I wanted to give Vietnamese food the love and attention that it deserves.My Vietnamese followers call me... \u201cbig sis,\u201d or chi hai. That is truly an honor, for someone who isn\u2019t related to you to call you that. That is what my sister calls me. I\u2019ve been taking care of her since I was in third grade, so I\u2019ve always been in the position of being an older sister and I still give off that vibe. I have people that aren't even Vietnamese telling me that my videos and my recipes are so easy, that they feel like they can do it themselves, too.I went to culinary school with a dream to... one day own a restaurant so I can feed people my food. At the time, I had a very narrow mindset that I needed to work my way up the ladder in the industry because that\u2019s usually how it is. After sharing my recipes online, I realized that I can actually feed people through pop-ups.Transitioning from cooking online to cooking in real life... has been the most rewarding and exciting thing that I have done. I\u2019m able to provide people with different experiences every time I host a pop-up. I did one back in September with i.8sushi, an old culinary school friend, and a future one with Fly By Jing at Family Style Food Festival [happening October 10]. The one with i.8sushi was a sushi box we collaborated on that featured rolls with Vietnamese flavors. At this point in my career, I\u2019m just having fun and exploring all the opportunities that come my way. To be able to walk around and talk to people and meet people and have people taste my food is so surreal.I don\u2019t know what the future holds... but I do know that I'll be working with food for the rest of my life. That's how I express myself. That's how I'm able to honor my culture. That's how I tell my story.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsPerson of InterestRead MoreLifestyle\u2018Kid of the Internet\u2019 Quinta Brunson Wants Us to Keep Growing (and Growing and Growing)By Leigh-Ann JacksoncultureHow Paralympian Kaleo Kanahele Maclay Gets Through Training, Motherhood, and Running a Coffee ShopBy Ali FrancisrestaurantsStefano Diaz Is Building a Better Butcher ShopBy Sara B.
