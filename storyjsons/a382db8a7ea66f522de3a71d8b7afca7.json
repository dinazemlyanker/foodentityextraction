A mix of whole and thinly sliced berries looks best\u2014any ice tray will work. Depending on the sweetness of your ginger ale and hard cider, you might not need the simple syrup, but it will be worth making to have on hand for other cocktails (a pre-feast Whiskey Smash? An NYE French 75? We could go on).All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

It is a bit strong, but we were fine with that! Adding more cranberry juice lowers the booziness. We made the cranberry ice cubes and they were the star - everyone loved them! \nThis was a super easy recipe that I\u2019ll make again very soon. Rachel Z1/1/2022Very festive. I accidentally put too much run in, even with that, did not find it as strong as previous reviews. Will definitely use again over the holidays. \nNot too sweet, limey and refreshing. Was a hit with our family. AnonymousMichigan12/26/2021Fabulous. Definitely strong but absolutely delicious. Had it for work party and everyone loved itKe HaAtlanta, GA12/24/2021Extremely easy \u2014 didn't have time to make the cranberry ice, so just threw regular ice and frozen cranberries into the drink. Totally beautiful holiday vibes in a coupe glass. VERY strong, as a word of warning. Anna12/13/2021The servings seem inaccurate for this recipe. A fifth contains at least 15 shots (depending on how you measure a shot).
