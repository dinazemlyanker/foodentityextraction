Or if we were at her house, she\u2019d retrieve one of the dried varieties from the plastic pouches cinched tight with rubber bands that lined her pantry shelves. I loved them so much that I\u2019d almost forget about the chocolate I\u2019d been craving.Sour and salty and sometimes sweet, preserved plums pack a wallop of pucker-inducing flavor. The most basic iterations contain just salt and sugar, while other varieties are marinated with top notes of licorice, cloves, and citrus. They come in two forms: The drier, saltier, and much tarter incarnation is called \u8a71\u6885 (huamei) in Mandarin or \u65c5\u884c\u6885 (li hing mui) in Cantonese. According to Hanson Li, cofounder of Lazy Susan in San Francisco, huamei lovers \u201calmost treat [them] like gum, sucking and chewing on [them] for a long time.\u201d \u9673\u76ae\u6885 (chan pui mui) is the more kid-friendly version\u2014a fleshy, sticky-sweet confection about the size of a large gumball that comes wrapped in wax paper.Chan Pui Mui (Sweet Preserved Plums)$14 at Amazon$5 at Weee!Half snack, half cure-all for whatever ails you, preserved plums\u2014particularly the dried varieties\u2014can help with everything from combating nausea to stimulating the appetite. George Chen, founder of China Live in San Francisco, remembers the nausea cure well: \u201cWhen we would go on car trips with my dad and some of us kids would get carsick, my mom would say, \u2018Eat a huamei!\u2019\u201d And when I was pregnant with my first child, huamei kept my first-trimester nausea at bay.Huamei\u2019s vibrant flavor also imparts extra oomph to cooked dishes. My grandmother\u2014a native of Hunan, a region known for its spicy and sour dishes\u2014combined Chinese dried plums with soy sauce, ginger, sugar and chile for an umami-infused glaze that she brushed onto proteins as varied as spareribs, fish, and chicken. At China Live, Chen features huamei in the restaurant\u2019s most popular vegetarian entr\u00e9e\u2014Sichuan Blistered Green Beans. \u201cIt has this wonderful tanginess, like tamarind or hawthorn,\u201d Chen says. \u201cIt balances the other flavors out.\u201d Li compares it to the preserved lemons used in Mediterranean cuisines: \u201cI\u2019ve squished it in hot water to get a flavored tea and grated it like you would lemon zest.\u201dHuamei (Sour, Salty Preserved Plums)$7 at Weee!Iterations of preserving stone fruit like this abound across different cultures and reflect its universal appeal. Huamei is similar to Mexican chamoy, for example, which historians believe was brought over from China and gained a foothold after hundreds of years. Hawaii and Japan have their own versions (and accompanying rabid fan bases) as well. But for me, the sweet, sticky orb, carefully liberated from its crinkling wrapper and inner square of plastic, just tastes like home.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make.
