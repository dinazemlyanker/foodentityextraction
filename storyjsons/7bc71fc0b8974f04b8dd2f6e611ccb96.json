I could not tell you), I got to spend a long weekend gallivanting around the city of Dallas, our 2019 Restaurant City of the Year, eating everything I laid my eyes on in the name of journalism. There was a lot of impressive food there\u2014that\u2019s how it got named City of Year, after all\u2014but one restaurant in particular lodged itself into my memory and has not left since, intervening apocalypse and all. That was Khao Noodle Shop (our No. 2 Best New Restaurant of 2019), where chef Donny Sirisavath pays tribute to his late mother with highly personal riffs on Laotian street food.It\u2019s the kind of place where you want to bring a couple friends and order the entire menu to share family-style, from the hot bowls of noodles to an array of handheld snacks like fried shrimp bites, tapioca dumplings, and very addictive beef jerky. It\u2019s the kind of place I dream about now, trapped in my 600-square-foot cell in Brooklyn remembering the days when we could fly across the country, pass around a communal bowl of sukiyaki, and reach our grubby little hands into the same jerky basket over and over without a care.So yeah, I can\u2019t go back to Dallas or even share food right now. But lucky for me, Khao Noodle Shop now sells its jerky to-go\u2014and ships it nationally.To make the stuff, Chef Sirisavath marinates hunks of Angus eye of round beef in soy sauce, garlic, lemongrass, cracked peppercorn, and brown sugar caramelized in fish sauce. Then he lays out the strips of beef on a drying rack, dehydrates them for four hours, and flash-fries each one. The result is a seriously moist and meaty bite drenched in salty-spicy flavor\u2014eons away from the gas station beef jerky you\u2019re probably used to (which, for the record, I also like).And while I miss the baskets themselves, and the communal tables, and watching Sirisavath and his team work in the open kitchen, this is the next best thing. It\u2019s the desk snack I crave even when my desk is my kitchen table and an entire refrigerator\u2019s worth of food sits just four steps away.Khao Noodle Beef Jerky$13 at Khao NoodleExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendDallasShoppingRestaurantsRecipes you want to make.
