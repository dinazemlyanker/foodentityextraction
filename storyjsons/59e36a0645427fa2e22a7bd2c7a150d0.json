It\u2019s boring. Oh, sure, it comes in handy after a long morning run, but how often is that? I much prefer bubbles. Bubbles are extra. They make everything more fabulous, from sweltering forest baths to I\u2019ll Be Gone in the Dark marathons. Hydrating becomes a delight rather than a chore.The problem is that I don\u2019t live by a naturally effervescent spring. I hear there\u2019s one in Colorado or Utah, but that\u2019s too far for me. I know, I know, sparkling water is sold in grocery stores\u2014but in disposable plastic! I may as well fly to Utah for all the good I\u2019m doing the planet. A dandy friend I know has it delivered to his door in a wooden crate once a week. Very posh, but above my pay grade. Then I learned about these machines that make sparkling water for you right in the comfort of your own home! Well, hello! Unfortunately most of those machines are also made of plastic and take up way too much real estate on my minuscule New York City kitchen counter! I thought I was damned to choose the lesser of these evils\u2014until I came across the Aarke Sparkling Water Maker.Leave it to the Swedes to design a practical yet beautiful solution to my conundrum. Maybe that\u2019s what happens when you get free health care and free education and the government actually pays you to have babies\u2014and then pays you to stay home to take care of those babies! Everyone is happy, well rested, and has the mental space to think about improving our lives and answering big questions like: How do I get bubbly water without having to go to Utah?The Aarke produces 60 liters of perfect bubbly water from one CO2 canister. That\u2019s 30 two-liter plastic bottles I didn\u2019t add to that insane ocean flotilla we \u201caccidentally\u201d created in the Pacific. Now I can drink all the sparkling water I want with one less care in the world. Just add ice and vodka.
