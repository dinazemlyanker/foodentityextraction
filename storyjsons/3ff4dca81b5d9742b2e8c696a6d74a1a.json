You\u2019re getting tired. But you need to keep going. It\u2019s time for a tequila coffee.By Amanda ShapiroMarch 15, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailYou know when you\u2019re having one of those nights, usually a couple drinks in, and a sort of magic takes over and the momentum starts building, and it\u2019s clear that you\u2019re going to have increasing amounts of fun for the rest of the night and maybe forever? And every decision you make is brilliant and inspired, including putting tequila in your coffee? That\u2019s what happened to me.It was a Saturday, and I was still at an age when going to three parties in a night sounded like a reasonable and totally normal idea. I\u2019d had a great time at the first one (a disco party hosted by the too-cool-for-me guy I\u2019d just started dating) and was en route to the second (a birthday in a basement bar) with aforementioned too-cool guy when I realized I'd made a rookie mistake.As everyone knows, when you\u2019re running the party marathon, the worst thing you can do is let your drinking outpace your partying,  but that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019d done. I\u2019d peaked too early; now I was thinking about bed. Normally I would've ghosted, but the too-cool guy seemed to want to keep hanging out. The stakes were too damn high.There are many ways to stay awake in this world. I usually rely on stress, but when that\u2019s not doing it, I go for the harder stuff. Let me amend that: The legal harder stuff. I walked into a corner bodega and poured a cup of coffee from the diner-style pot in the corner. By the taste and texture, I\u2019d guess it had been there a day, maybe two.I still can\u2019t remember why I had a tiny bottle of tequila on me. Tiny bottles of liquor are not things I tend to carry around like Chapstick. All I know is that one minute I was putting shelf-stable creamer in my coffee under the harsh store lights, and the next minute I was standing curbside, pouring the tequila in.It\u2019s been years, but I remember exactly how it tasted: Creamy, bracing, and not at all like tequila. Somehow, the coffee completely masked the liquor, and the liquor completely masked the burned coffee, and all that was left was a gentle, warming, sweetness and a waft of booze on the nose. It was so delicious, so easy to drink, and total rocket fuel.There\u2019s a lot of unscientific, totally anecdotal stuff online about how tequila is an \u201cupper.\u201d I\u2019m not saying I believe any of that, but this drink gave me such a smooth, no-jitters lift that I made it to all the parties and chaperoned a friend home to bed.I\u2019ve seen variations of tequila and coffee on bar menus listed as \u201cMexican coffee\u201d with kahlua, sugar, whipped cream. You could certainly do it with your favorite pour-over blend and that black-label Espol\u00f3n. But let me assure you that you don\u2019t need any of that stuff. Even the creamer is optional (though it\u2019s helpful if you\u2019re masking old-coffee taste). Tequila coffee is about two things only, in whatever proportions feel right. It\u2019s a drink for night owls and party kids and people without budgets for 5-ingredient cocktails. It\u2019s for those years when it feels like any random Saturday could be the best night of your life.Or try this caffeinated cocktail:Explore Bon App\u00e9titTequilaCoffeeCocktailTrendsRead MorecultureThe Cocktail Formula That You Need to Memorize NowBy Chris MoroccoPhotography by Ted CavanaughRecipes you want to make.
