But no one has to know.By Carey PolisJune 28, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca JurkevichFacebookTwitterEmailIn the 4.5 years I have worked at BonApp, I have campaigned for many recipes to exist on our site: a salmon burger that isn\u2019t dry, ooey gooey butter cake, and baked ziti. But the campaign I was most passionate about, most willing to not give up the fight (see: mug cake attempt #4 of fall 2016) was getting a proper Eton Mess in the pages of our magazine and online. It has finally happened, people, and June 2018 has been a glorious month of celebration.Eton mess is essentially a less-scripted trifle without the cake; it\u2019s whipped cream mixed with strawberries and meringues. And yes, its origins do come from a certain British private school.Why is this four-ingredient recipe worth so much devotion? Because it epitomizes everything I want in a dessert: under 30-minute preparation, varying textures, and the opportunity to be sincere when saying, \u201cOh this? It was no big deal. Really, it was nothing. No, really. Have seconds!\u201d Let\u2019s break it down:Quick PrepIf you can buy strawberries, toss them in sugar, and simmer them on the stove, then you\u2019ve got this. Layer the berries on top of whipped cream (yes, please, make it yourself) and store-bought meringues. That\u2019s... it. Eton mess is essentially one more step beyond serving berries and cream, which is a great dessert already, but lacks any sort of complexity. Meringues\u2014even store-bought ones\u2014make it seem like you really went out of your way (I know, you didn\u2019t, sshhhh).Varying TexturesEach bite should have a combination of softly crunchy meringues with cream whipped to soft peaks so it remains a tiny bit loose. In this particular recipe, half of the strawberries are cooked for about 25 minutes, and the other half are mixed in after\u2014so some are mushy and others retain a bit of give. Three ingredients, four textures.It\u2019s No Big DealThere\u2019s something about fresh whipped cream that really impresses people. It seems so elegant, so refined, so... not from a $2 carton at the grocery store. Ditto with the strawberries: Even if the ones you have aren\u2019t the best quality, since you\u2019re mixing them with sugar, it... doesn\u2019t reallyyyy matter. Let the dinner guests think you put together something complicated. They don\u2019t need to see that plastic clamshell of meringues sitting on your counter or the bruises on your berries. Whipped cream hides everything.Get the recipe:Strawberry Eton MessLet us introduce you to summer\u2019s easiest dessert.View RecipeAnd FYI, here\u2019s how to make whipped cream by hand:Explore Bon App\u00e9titDessertWhipped CreamStrawberryRecipes you want to make.
