But when you simmer a whole head of cauliflower with onion, garlic, and half-and-half, then blend it all until thick and velvety, it makes a sublime creamy cauliflower\u00a0soup that\u2019s all the more remarkable because it's so quick to prepare. Half-and-half adds just the right amount of rich dairy flavor to help the cauliflower taste its best, but you could also use milk, heavy cream (or mix equal parts of both for DIY half-and-half), or plant-based milk. Don\u2019t skip the white pepper or the fresh lemon juice\u2014they\u2019re the secret ingredients that\u2019ll have you craving spoonful after spoonful. The cheesy mustard croutons on top offer an ideal mix of sharp and rich flavors, but this creamy soup would also be delicious topped with toasted sunflower seeds, a spoonful of chili crisp, or some pesto. \u2014Christina ChaeyAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Heat 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a large saucepan or small Dutch oven over medium-low. Add 1 medium onion, chopped, and season with kosher salt. Cook, stirring occasionally and reducing heat if onion starts to brown, until softened but without taking on any color, 5\u20137 minutes. Add 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped, and cook, stirring, until softened and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add 1 large head of cauliflower (2\u00bd\u20133 lb.), florets broken into small pieces, core chopped, 1\u00bd tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00be tsp. Morton kosher salt, \u00bc tsp. freshly ground white or black pepper, and 5\u00bd cups water (the water should just barely cover the cauliflower). Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, and simmer, uncovered, until cauliflower is completely tender and starting to fall apart, 15\u201320 minutes. Stir in \u00be cup half-and-half and simmer 5 minutes; remove from heat.Step 2While the soup is simmering, whisk 1 Tbsp. Dijon mustard, 1 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted, and 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a medium bowl to combine; season with salt and pepper. Add 5 cups country-style bread, preferably day-old, torn or sliced into 1\" cubes, and toss to coat in mustard mixture. Scatter \u00bd cup finely grated Gruy\u00e8re or cheddar over and toss again to combine. Transfer bread mixture to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and bake in a single layer, turning halfway through, until cheese is melted and croutons are golden brown and crisp, 10\u201315 minutes.Step 3Working in batches, carefully pur\u00e9e soup in a blender until very smooth, transferring to a medium bowl as you go. (Alternatively, you can use an immersion blender to blend soup in pot until smooth.) Return soup to pot and reheat over medium-low, stirring and adding more water to thin if needed (you\u2019re going for the consistency of heavy cream). Stir in 1 Tbsp. plus 1\u00bd tsp. fresh lemon juice. Taste and season soup with more salt and/or pepper if desired.Step 4Ladle soup into bowls. Top with cheesy mustard croutons and drizzle with more oil.Do ahead: Soup can be made 3 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill. Reheat soup over medium-low, adding a splash of water to thin if needed.How would you rate Creamy Cauliflower Soup With Cheesy Mustard Croutons?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (6)Back to TopTriangleWould add vegetable or chicken broth instead of water to cook the cauliflower not water and cream not half and half  would have been tastier and added some parsley at the end AnonymousNew Jersey 3/18/2022Whether you choose to use them with this soup or to float on some other soup or to top a salad or to serve them in a bowl as snack to accompany a libation (a nice Belgian ale comes to mind) or to include them as part of a charcuterie or crudite board, make these croutons.  They are \"keeper\" with this soup or not.  Sharp white cheddar (as example Cabot's extra sharp) works deliciously well.  dimmerswitchBoise3/8/2022Delicious and easy to make. GloLouisiana 2/22/2022Simply amazing!!AnonymousFt Myers Beach FL2/21/2022Delicious! The croutons with Dijon added a lot of flavor to the soup. Soup needed a little salt, otherwise it was perfect.CarieSt. Charles, IL2/21/2022Pretty good, the croutons had great flavor and crunch. I think the soup could use some extra salt and garlic but I would definitely make this again.KeiraVancouver 2/20/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titSoupSoups and StewsDinnerMainCauliflowerVegetableHealthyishNut-FreeVegetarianEasySimmerRecipes you want to make.
