Most doughs are sold in 1-lb. bags, but certain brands give you more. Roll any extra dough into ropes, tie in knots, and brush with a little olive oil mixed with a grated garlic clove. Bake until golden brown to make the easiest garlic knots.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Trim end of stem from 1 head of broccoli, then use a vegetable peeler to remove thick woody exterior of stalk (you can eat the broccoli stalk\u2014it\u2019s the best part!). Coarsely chop entire head of broccoli into \u00bd\" pieces.Step 2Toss broccoli on a rimmed baking sheet with 3 Tbsp. oil; season generously with salt. Roast, tossing once halfway through, until broccoli is browned all over and tender, 20\u201325 minutes. Let cool.Step 3While broccoli is roasting, remove 1 lb. pizza dough from refrigerator and let sit at room temperature (this will make it easier to stretch). Divide into 4 equal pieces and cover loosely with plastic wrap.Step 4Combine 2 cups mozzarella, 1 cup ricotta, \u00bd cup Parmesan, and \u00bd tsp. red pepper flakes in a medium bowl. Peel 1 garlic clove and grate on a microplane into bowl, then finely grate zest of 1 lemon into bowl (save remaining lemon for another use).Step 5Stack \u00bd cup basil leaves on top of each other and roll into a cigar shape. Slice leaves crosswise as thinly as possible (you can do this in 2 batches if needed). Add basil shreds to bowl.Step 6Season cheese mixture with salt, then scrape in roasted broccoli (save the baking sheet, which you\u2019re going to use it to bake the calzones). Stir with a flexible spatula to incorporate.Step 7Drizzle 1 Tbsp. oil over reserved baking sheet and spread around with fingers to coat surface. Beat 1 egg in a small bowl with a fork until no streaks remain.Step 8Working one piece at a time, roll out dough on a clean dry surface to an 8\" round. Brush a thin coating of egg wash around perimeter of dough. Spoon one-quarter of the cheese mixture onto one side of dough.Step 9Fold empty half of dough down over filling and press firmly all around edge to seal the two sides to form a half-moon shape. Press really firmly to prevent the calzones from opening during baking. Repeat with remaining pieces of dough and filling, transferring each to prepared sheet as they\u2019re done, spacing evenly.Step 10Brush dough all over with remaining egg wash.Step 11Do a final crimp around each calzone: fold the outermost \u00bd\" of border back up and over itself, pinching like crazy to seal.Step 12Bake calzones until dough is golden brown all over and bottom is well browned, 30\u201335 minutes. Transfer calzones to a wire rack. Poke a tiny hole with the tip of a knife into each calzone to let steam escape.Step 13Cut calzones in half and serve with marinara sauce alongside. Top with more grated Parmesan.How would you rate Easy Vegetarian Calzones?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (8)Back to TopTriangleThese were great.  I used homemade dough, increased the ricotta and halved the lemon zest.  Didn't bother with the marinana.  YUMMY!  Will definitely make again.AnonymousMaine11/1/2020I disagree with other reviewers who said the filling is too lemony. I thought it paired really well with the creamy ricotta and earthy broccoli. I added some roasted mushrooms to the filling as well, which complemented nicely, and added a bit extra crushed red pepper for a kick. I do agree that this recipe results in too much filling. Saving it for another purpose\u2014maybe spread on toast for tomorrow\u2019s lunch? yagurlcarlyTucson, Arizona6/25/2020Maybe would be better with a different dipping sauce. The calzones themselves are fine - but they're very lemony. And lemony is a very weird thing to pair with marinara sauce. They were fighting each other and you couldn't really appreciate the tastes of either.\n\nI had to spend a lot of time stretching the dough, before rolling, then picking up and stretching again, letting it rest, then finally rolling into an 8inch round -- if that's helpful to others!Anonymous5/22/2020Great crap booooAnonymousWisconsin 1/23/2020I did find the dough difficult to work with, some advice on that in the recipe would be great. I didn't find there to be too much filling, I had a little left over but that was mostly because one of the calzones ended up understuffed. They were really delicious, and definitely not too lemony.AnonymousColumbia, SC1/11/2020These took me about an hour from start to finish, and they were relatively straightforward in terms of the actual cooking process. A few tweaks I'd make if I did it again:\n-- Nix the lemons. The lemon flavor is distracting and overwhelming, and I used literally a quarter of what was called for. \n-- Increase the broccoli, decrease the mozzarella, and increase the ricotta. Decrease the overall amount of stuffing, because I ended up with about an extra calzone's worth. \n-- I thought I \"pinched like crazy.\" Alas, I did not. Next time I really and truly would. AnonymousBethesda, MD 8/19/2019Where to start? First off, working with the dough takes time. So, give a lot of time. Fine. But when you end up with calzones that only taste like lemon zest, not good. Needed much, much less lemon zest. And what do I do with pretty much over half of the stuffing that goes into this? Cut that in half. I hate waste. Win some, lose some, I guess.St. Louis3/15/2019Absolutely delicious, but honestly I'm just going to make it into a pizza next time. Still good though.foreverwerock5/18/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titSavory Pie & TartPizzaItalianEuropeanMozzarellaCheeseRicottaBroccoliVegetableEasyWeeknight MealsMainNut-FreeVegetarianSuper BowlDinnerBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
