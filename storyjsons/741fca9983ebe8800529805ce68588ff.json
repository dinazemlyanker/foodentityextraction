Two methods for getting big flavor in no time.By Alex DelanyMarch 20, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Heidi's BridgeFacebookTwitterEmailThere\u2019s this romantic idea that a truly great homemade tomato sauce requires hours of gentle simmering to be even remotely noodle-worthy. If you want spaghetti and red sauce on a Wednesday night, well, looks like you just have to buy a jar of marinara from the grocery store! When you're short on time, you've got to pay someone else to do all of that cooking for you, right?Not so fast! You've got more options than you think. You can absolutely make a delicious, from-scratch tomato sauce in less than 30 minutes. For real. Like, in the time it takes to boil a big pot of pasta water and cook some noodles, you can make sauce. We wouldn\u2019t lie to you. And we\u2019re not talking smack on a five hour Sunday gravy\u2014we love that stuff. But we don't always have the time. So given this new information, we just want to know: If you can make a killer tomato sauce in a half hour, why are you still buying jarred tomato sauce from the grocery store?The reason long-cooked tomato sauce is so tasty is that you\u2019re taking the time to cook off as much water as possible, concentrating the umami-rich flavors in those tomatoes. You're taking the time to develop the fruit's natural sugars, balancing the acidity of the tomatoes and smoothing out the sauce's edges. But when making a quick tomato sauce, you don\u2019t get all of that time to build flavor. You need to change up the procedure if you want to develop that complexity more quickly. And there are actually a couple ways to do that, both of which result in a flavorful sauce. And both start with saut\u00e9ing aromatics in olive oil.In the first technique\u2014one we utilize in our spaghetti pomodoro recipe\u2013you start with smashed garlic in olive oil. But it\u2019s what you do to the tomatoes that really deepens the flavor. Instead of crushing the whole peeled tomatoes and dumping them into you Dutch oven, we strain the liquid from the can into a bowl and throw the whole tomatoes into the Dutch oven, sans-liquid. This allows the tomato solids to caramelize without that liquid getting in the way. After they\u2019ve picked up some color and flavor,  you crush them with a wooden spoon and add the liquid back in, along with some basil, to reduce for about 15 more minutes.Adding Parm and butter to simple sauce builds texture and creamy flavor.\nPhoto by Heidi's BridgeWhen your pasta is a bit shy of al dente, you dump it into the pan with a little bit of the pasta water and stir to coat. Then you add two ingredients that make the sauce even tastier. Slowly sprinkle in some finely grated Parmesan cheese and then finish with a bit of butter. Then end result is a sauce that is hefty enough (thanks to butter and Parm) and naturally sweet enough (thanks to the strained and browned tomatoes). Thirty minutes. Super sauce. Done.But you can also go a different route\u2014one we use in our skillet lasagna recipe\u2014for an equally flavorful sauce. And this one comes together even more quickly. Here, you start with chopped onion and garlic. You\u2019ll see onion in almost every long-cooked red sauce ever\u2014partly because it\u2019s traditional, but mostly because onions provide sweetness. And in this method, you increase the onion quantity to deliver even more.A hefty portion of onions and garlic adds balancing sweetness to a tomato sauce.\nAfter the onions and garlic start to caramelize over medium heat, you add crushed tomatoes\u2014we\u2019re on the fast track here, and this saves the time of crushing whole peeled tomatoes\u2014directly to the skillet and season the whole thing with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Then we just let it simmer for fifteen minutes, giving it a stir every once in a while. There\u2019s no Parm or butter here. It\u2019s all about quick, simple tomato flavor, balanced by the sweetness of onions and garlic. And while this sauce is delicious layered up with ricotta and sheets of pasta, it'd be every bit as tasty tossed in the pan with spaghetti and a few splashes of starchy pasta water.There you go. Two quick methods that deliver the tomato sauce flavors you know and love, without standing over the stove for hours or shelling out for the pricey store-bought stuff. Plus, you know exactly what\u2019s going into that homemade sauce\u2014there\u2019s probably less sodium, sugar, and preservatives in your quick tomato creation. Apologies to your favorite jarred sauce, but you're on to bigger and better things. Nice knowing you, bud!And here's that lasagna we were talking about earlier:Basically Skillet LasagnaFinally: an easy, cheesy, vegetarian(!) lasagna recipe that doesn't require you to dirty every pot and pan in your kitchen.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyTomatoTomato SaucePastaRecipes you want to make.
