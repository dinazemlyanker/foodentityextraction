Didn\u2019t think so.By Amiel StanekJune 13, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.I wouldn\u2019t call myself a sticky bun person. I\u2019ve just never really understood what all the fuss was all about. A spiral of wan, eggy, underdeveloped dough, a dusting of cinnamon, a sticky, too-sweet mess of caramel. Not hating; just not my cup of tea.But then I met golfeados. And everything changed.I was cruising around Denver, minding my own business, when I found myself in the food hall attached to The Source Hotel. I smelled Reunion Bread Co. well before I saw it, an aromatic cloud of crusty sourdough and browned butter and caramelized sugar that practically dragged me by the nose into Ismael de Sousa\u2019s tidy little stall. A spread of impossibly delicious looking breads and pastries were arrayed jewel-like on creamy white marble, a glass half wall the only thing keeping me from reflexively divebombing them like some kind of sugar-crazed bird with a deathwish. Cinnamon-sugar dusted \u201cchurro\u201d croissants filled with dulce de leche. Perfect little pasteis de nata\u2014delicate, lemony Portugese egg tarts. Crackly-crusted rounds of country bread. But it was a sheet pan checkered with deeply browned, sticky-looking spirals of dough flecked with what appeared to be crumbs of cheese (!!!) that stopped me in my tracks. \u201cGolfeado,\u201d read the little sign in front of this tray of glorious madness. \u201c(Venezuelan Sticky Bun).\u201d I ordered one immediately.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.I took a bite before I had even finished tapping through the Square reader\u2019s payment menus. (One thousand apologies to the person behind me in line; I swear I had no idea how long I was standing there chewing with my eyes closed.) It was everything I\u2019ve ever wanted in a pastry. A flaky coil of buttery laminated dough\u2014as in, what they make croissants out of\u2014lacquered with a rich, raw sugar syrup and pushed right to that beautiful, bittersweet razor\u2019s edge between browned and burnt. At once crispy and yielding and chewy, it was shot through with toasty walnuts and perfumed with anise seeds. But it was a shower of what I later found out was cotija cheese that secured this golfeado\u2019s spot in my personal pastry pantheon. Mouthwateringly salty, tangy, and just the right amount of aged cheese\u2013funky, it felt simultaneously like a left-field wildcard and something that belonged there the entire time, the perfect foil to that dense wall of sugar and butter.Now this was a sticky bun I could get behind.On one hand, I\u2019m forever grateful to de Sousa for redeeming what I thought was an irredeemable dessert. On the other hand? I will forever pass rows of basic-ass sticky buns, my hopes forever up, forever wishing they were golfeados.Go there: Reunion Bread Co.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsDenverRecipes you want to make.
