(Yeah, it's as good as it sounds.) In France, the croque monsieur is traditionally served as a bar snack, but this recipe scales up easily and is a great brunch for a crowd. And once you master b\u00e9chamel, the super-simple cream sauce that is the star of this dish, the possibilities are endless\u2014it's the base of so many indulgent classics, from macaroni and cheese to lasagna...and also tastes great on just about anything.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Gruy\u00e8re2Tbsp. unsalted butter2Tbsp. all-purpose flour1\u00bccups whole milk\u00betsp. kosher salt\u00bctsp. freshly ground nutmeg1Tbsp. Dijon mustard, plus more for serving8\u00bd\"-thick slices country-style or sourdough bread8oz. sliced hamCornichons (for serving)PreparationStep 1Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 425\u00b0. Grate 4 oz. Gruy\u00e8re on the large holes of a box grater and set aside for later. (If you're not a fan of Gruy\u00e8re, a sharp cheddar would make a delicious substitute.)Step 2B\u00e9chamel time! The first step to making this classic cream sauce is to make a roux, which is really just fat and flour cooked together to create a thickening agent. Melt 2 Tbsp. butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Add 2 Tbsp. all-purpose flour and cook, whisking constantly, until butter and flour are well combined and foaming but still very pale in color, about 2 minutes. (While there are some instances\u2014such as gumbo\u2014in which you actually want a dark-colored roux, this is not one of them.)Step 3Very slowly stream in 1\u00bc cups whole milk, whisking constantly (this has to be done very gradually because if you incorporate the milk into the roux too quickly, it can become very lumpy), until mixture is pale and smooth. And that's the base of your b\u00e9chamel sauce!Step 4Continue to cook, whisking constantly, until sauce is thickened (it should leave a trail when you run your whisk through it) and shiny and the foaming has slowed down, 6\u20138 minutes. It\u2019s important to keep an eye on the b\u00e9chamel and stir often; otherwise, you can scorch the bottom of the pot and be left with a lumpy sauce with an unpleasant flavor.Step 5Remove from heat and stir in \u00be tsp. salt, \u00bc tsp. freshly ground nutmeg, and 1 Tbsp. Dijon mustard.Step 6Using a spoon, spread b\u00e9chamel over 1 side of each slice of country-style bread, making sure to cover the full surface.Step 7Transfer 4 slices, sauce side up, to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Divide 8 oz. sliced ham among slices on sheet, then top with half of reserved Gruy\u00e8re.Step 8Top with remaining slices of bread sauce side up. Sprinkle remaining cheese over each.Step 9Bake sandwiches until cheese and sauce are lightly browned and bubbling, 10\u201315 minutes.Step 10Slice sandwiches crosswise on a diagonal. Serve with cornichons and extra Dijon mustard for dipping alongside.

Much easier to make than I was expecting from reading the recipe. And it came together pretty quickly and not a lot of cleanup! Yay!mabeorNew York5/12/2020This hits the spot! Actually quite easy to make and tasted exactly how I hoped it would. Brings me back to trips to France. Thank you!adamleclairOsaka, Japan5/8/2020This sandwich was PERFECT! My boyfriend wanted to make grilled cheese and I was excited to find this recipe. A little different than what he said he wanted, but we decided to give it a go. We found delicious country bread from our local bakery that created the perfect canvas for the b\u00e9chamel sauce, gruyere and ham. The mustard gave it a hint of spice and the cornichones added that balance of tangy to the somewhat heavy sandwich. We did have quite a lot of b\u00e9chamel left over so that's just something to keep in mind. Otherwise, this dish is perfection AnonymousKansas City1/12/2020Tastes amazing! I used this recipe to practice making bechamel and it came out perfectly. Definitely making it again. AnonymousSouth Africa 1/3/2020SO. GOOD. Tastes exactly like the ones I've had in France. AnonymousCanada5/23/2019This was fantastic. I ended up using 8 oz cheese but everything else was the perfect amount.
