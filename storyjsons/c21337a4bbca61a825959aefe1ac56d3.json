It\u2019s a beautiful, sunny summer evening. You spy a coveted outdoor table at your neighborhood bar and, chilly drinks in hand, make a beeline for it. You and your friends fling yourself into some patio chairs, plop down your drinks and\u2014THOOOOIIIIING\u2014chaos ensues. The table pitches back and forth like a football bobblehead. Everyone grabs for their tottering beverages, trying desperately to prevent spritzes and garnishes and straws (paper, natch) from making contact with summer whites. Eyes wide with surprise, hearts racing, the reality of the situation dawns on you and your band of unsuspecting revelers: You picked yourself a wobbly table.IMHO, how you proceed from here says a lot about who you are as a person. There are the buck-passers, cretins who are content to simply stand up, find another table, and pass their misfortune on to some other unsuspecting soul. There are the helpless and entitled, who will quickly flag the closest member of the service staff and expect them to get on their hands and knees and do something to rectify the situation. There are the dreaded Band-Aiders, who will find the closest piece of flexible mass\u2014bar coasters, an old magazine, a wad of tissues\u2014and cram it under the offending table leg to create temporary, sloppy stability. (And, as someone who cleaned the floor of a bar in my previous life, this turns into a gross mess at the end of the night.) Then there are the Boy Scouts, the ones who came prepared. They will produce from their bag a Wobble Wedge, a ridged plastic shim tailor-made for exactly this purpose, put it where it belongs, and fix the problem so that it stays fixed.(More about my previous life: I was a Boy Scout for nearly 12 years.)Ever since I first encountered Wobble Wedges at my local hardware store in college, I\u2019ve made a point of keeping at least one in every tote bag, fanny pack, and backpack I\u2019ve ever owned so that I\u2019m ready to perform a small\u2014but important!\u2014act of community service at a moment\u2019s notice. They\u2019re ingenious in their simplicity: a piece of tapered plastic that slides effortlessly under the most stubbornly wonky table leg, with just enough texture that it won\u2019t slide out. And while I\u2019ve used them to quickly stabilize countless restaurant tables, they\u2019re no one trick pony\u2014my trusty Wobble Wedges have been deployed to fix cockeyed Airbnb stoves and teetering toilets (a thing!) to great effect as well.Also: They\u2019re cheap! Wobble Wedges are sold by the tub and, depending on the quantity you\u2019re willing to buy, cost between 19 and 40 cents a pop. (I started on the 30 packs but have long since upgraded to the much more cost-effective 300 packs.) A small price to pay for always being ready to solve one of life\u2019s most minute yet vexing problems, and a meaningful gesture of good will towards the restaurants, bars, and cafes that give us so much. You too, friend, can be part of the solution.I leave you with a quote from the company\u2019s founder, the late, great Alfred Wobble Wedge*:\u201cAsk not what your favorite restaurant can do for you.Ask what you can do for your favorite restaurant.\u201d*This is not a real person, and they have never said this.Buy it: Wobble WedgeAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
