Here Lunar New Year is celebrated with a special menu that pays homage to family celebrations full of food, fireworks, and mahjong. Traditionally, Lunar New Year meals involve several dishes that are meant to bring luck, happiness, and prosperity in the upcoming year. For chef Shuai Wang, that means a lineup of childhood classics that are inspired by his mother and grandmother. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the significance behind each dish on the menu.Photo by Tim RobisonThe NoodlesDuring Lunar New Year, long noodles represent longevity and happiness. Wang stir-fries his lo mein with beech, oyster, and shiitake mushrooms grown by local farmers, topping them with a generous dollop of butter and crispy garlic aonori\u2014an unseasoned seaweed powder that gives the noodles a deep green-tea flavor. \u201cNever bite down on the noodle,\u201d Wang instructs. Eating each strand in one slurp without breaking it is believed to maximize your good fortune.Photo by Tim RobisonThe Pork Trotters\u201cTrotters are about wealth,\u201d Wang says. \u201cMy mom always told me they\u2019re meant as another foot or hand to grab more money for next year.\u201d Traditionally, for Lunar New Year pork trotters are served whole, but the chef \u2019s reimagined version involves braising, shredding, and shaping them into cakes that get breaded with panko and fried to form a crispy katsu.Photo by Tim RobisonThe DumplingsDumplings also symbolize wealth due to their likeness to yuanbao, an ancient form of Chinese currency. Wang fills his with Napa cabbage and rich Mangalitsa pork (sustainably sourced from Holy City Hogs on nearby Wadmalaw Island) seasoned with Chinese cooking wine and soy sauce. Once boiled they\u2019re garnished with vinegar, chili oil, cilantro, and peanuts.Photo by Tim RobisonThe FishFor continuous prosperity in the new year, Wang says you have to serve a whole fish: head-on, bone-in. Here he opts for flounder caught off the coast of Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, by local fishery Abundant Seafood. Steaming brings out the fish\u2019s natural sweetness, so seasoning is kept light: Chinese cooking wine with a bit of soy sauce and fermented black beans. Raw julienned leeks and ginger finish off the dish, with a ginger-scallion chimichurri on the side.Explore Bon App\u00e9titDish DecodedPhiladelphiaChineseLunar New YearRead MorerestaurantsHow Do I Love Thee, Chinese Sponge Cake?
