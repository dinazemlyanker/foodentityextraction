Which is why, for at least 75 percent of the year, we rely on canned tomatoes\u2014which can often be better tasting than the fresh ones. But when you know an ingredient so well, sometimes you get stuck in a rut of making the same thing all the time. Crushing them for sauce (without getting your shirt dirty!) or a basic tomato soup are reliable options, but we know you can do better.We took inspiration from six chefs on how they\u2019d doctor up a can of whole peeled tomatoes, and they got creative. Make sure to buy high-quality tomatoes for best results\u2014we like the San Marzano brand ($10 on Amazon) or La Bella San Marzano ($29 for 6 cans on Amazon). Read on to find out how to make roasted tomato jam for easy party bruschetta, 7-ingredient shortcut Tikka Masala sauce, and more ideas equally well-suited for a weeknight as a dinner party.Roasted Tomato Jam\u201cNeed a quick appetizer for a party? Make roasted tomato jam. Chop 2 cloves of garlic and 1 shallot as fine as possible, and then combine with 1 Tbsp. sugar and 2 Tbsp. sherry vinegar, and 1 can whole peeled tomatoes in a shallow roasting tray. Cook in a 300\u00b0 oven for about 30 minutes, or until it caramelized on top. Tomatoes are ready when all liquid appears to be reduced. Throw in a \u00bd cup parsley and 1 Tbsp. fresh oregano leaves after it cooks, and serve with canned sardines, white anchovies, jam\u00f3n, or prosciutto and toast.\u201d \u2014Rachael Polhill, executive chef at Dante in NYCPumpkin Salsa Fresca\u201cDrain a can of whole, peeled tomatoes, chop them up, and mix with 1 cup chopped cilantro (no stems), \u00bd cup diced red onion, 2 roasted and finely chopped serrano peppers, and 2 Tbsp. lemon juice. Salt and pepper to taste, and then mix in some toasted and ground pepitas for a delicious pumpkin salsa fresca. Serve with tortilla chips.\u201d \u2014Chef Vicente Sosa, executive chef at Que Bueno Suerte in DenverCreamy Vegan Tomato Soup\u201cYou can make super simple tomato soup with four ingredients. Sweat out 2 cloves of garlic and half a chopped small onion with a good amount of chile flakes\u2014as gutsy as you can be\u2014in olive oil. Add a can of whole peeled tomatoes and cook 10 minutes max. Blend it with another \u00bd cup of oil and you\u2019ll get a really intense, creamy amazing soup without any added dairy\u2014it\u2019s vegan! You\u2019ll see the color change from dark red to bright orange, and that\u2019s when you\u2019ll know you\u2019ve really emulsified the fat into it.\u201d \u2014Colin Lynch, executive chef and co-owner of Bar Mezzana in BostonQuick Tikka Masala Sauce\u201cMy quick Tikka Masala sauce only uses seven ingredients. To make it, melt a stick of butter and add 2 Tbsp. Tandoori Masala seasoning mix (I like Shan brand, $2 on Amazon) and 2 Tbsp. dried Fenugreek leaves. Saut\u00e9 until aromatic, add 1 can pur\u00e9ed whole peeled tomatoes, and bring to a simmer. Then add \u00bd cup heavy cream, 2 Tbsp. honey, and salt to taste, and simmer for 5 minutes. Serve with protein of your choice (like chicken), rice, and naan.\u201d \u2014Maneet Chauhan, chef and owner of Chauhan Ale and Masala House in NashvilleSuper Garlicky Tomato Sauce\u201cOne of the easiest ways to doctor up a can of tomatoes is to make \u2018TBG\u2019 (Tomato Basil Garlic) sauce. Drain the liquid from the whole tomatoes, tear them in half and remove the seeds, then coarsely chop. Take a lot of peeled garlic cloves\u2014I like to use a full head, so at least 12 cloves\u2014and slice as thin as you can; \u201cGoodfellas thin.\u201d (A Japanese mandoline makes this incredibly easy.)  Add 1 cup of extra virgin olive oil and the \u201cGoodfellas garlic\u201d to a large (3\u20134 qt) heavy-bottomed pot over medium-low heat. Once the garlic is extremely aromatic and begins to soften, add the chopped tomatoes and about 1 cup of the reserved tomato liquid. Simmer over medium-low heat for about 20 minutes then add a whole stalk of basil. Remove the pot from the heat, and adjust the texture of the sauce to your liking by adding a little more tomato juice to thin. Pull the basil out after about 5 minutes so it doesn\u2019t turn brown and the sauce retains a fresh herb flavor. Serve with pasta.\u201d \u2014Chef Ryan Prentiss, executive chef at Prime + Proper in DetroitAsian-Inspired Baked Eggs\u201cI make my family\u2019s favorite breakfast with a can of tomatoes: Asian-inspired baked eggs. While you\u2019re gathering your ingredients, roast 1 shallot in the oven, skin on, for 12 minutes at 350\u00b0 and then let cool before peeling. Meanwhile, saut\u00e9 2 Tbsp. chopped cilantro stems and 2 cloves thinly-sliced garlic until aromatic with a few tablespoons of neutral oil. Add 1 can whole peeled tomatoes, 2 Tbsp. chipotle peppers in adobo, and the crushed roasted shallot, and then cook for 20 minutes. Add 4 Tbsp. soy sauce and cook for 10 more minutes. It should be slightly reduced and rich. Spoon 1\u20132 cups in a mini cast-iron skillet and crack an egg on top\u2014or do a few eggs in a larger skillet\u2014and bake at 350\u00b0 for 4\u20136 minutes, or until egg is just set. Use toast for dipping!\u201d \u2014Chef Louis Tikaram, executive chef at E.P. & L.P. in Los AngelesThis butter-roasted tomato sauce also goes well with pasta:Explore Bon App\u00e9titChefsTomatoRead MorecultureHow 5 Chefs Doctor Up Their Scrambled EggsBy Alex Delanyculture5 Pastry Chefs on How to Doctor Up Boxed Brownie MixBy Alex Beggsculture5 Chefs on How They'd Doctor Up Frozen PizzaBy Alex BeggscookingCanned Tomatoes Are Better Than Fresh Ones (Yeah, We Said It)By Alex DelanyRecipes you want to make.
