Have a question? Email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.\u00a0Do sporting events have veggie dogs yet? I\u2019d probably go to more of them if they did. \u2014Veggie VaraThere are Beyond sausages, Impossible burgers, Chik\u2019n nachos, and other meatless options (including a curious amount of vegan chili) at most stadiums now, but you have to research where to find them before you go because they aren\u2019t at every concession stand the way \u201cregular meat\u201d is. This is small progress, but we\u2019ll take it.I don\u2019t enjoy sports. Can I use food runs as a time killer? \u2014Not-Into-It NicoDepends on where you\u2019re sitting. Aisle? Go blow your entire paycheck at Hungry Howie\u2019s. But if your beautiful butt is going to be in my face more than five times this game, you risk the silent steaming fury of a stranger who\u2019ll never, ever confront you. Just\u2026think of others!Illustration by Zak Tebbal\u00a0Why don\u2019t all American stadiums serve poutine at sporting events when it\u2019s the best stadium food? \u2014Canadian CoreyFor the same reason we\u2019ll never get universal health care. We know it\u2019s good for us, but we\u2019re so far gone now it\u2019d be embarrassing to start over. However, I\u2019ll never give up hope!Illustration by Zak TebbalWhat\u2019s the move in terms of taking home that souvenir helmet after you eat all the nachos out of it? \u2014Souvenir Stacy\u00a0As someone who has written extensively about the sanctity of souvenir helmet nachos, I can tell you what I do. Wipe the bowl out with dry napkins (water complicates things) and wash it more thoroughly when you get home. Like the Detroit Tigers, you\u2019re just going to be happy with good enough for now.Illustration by Zak TebbalWhat\u2019s appropriate to eat/ drink out of the Stanley Cup? \u2014Hockey HendrickThe Cup is for liquids and snacks only. Require a utensil? Find another trophy. The thought of spoons scraping the silver-and-nickel-alloy bowl makes me want to be preserved in the ice at Little Caesars Arena while the Red Wings skate over my bones.Yea:Champagne/beerSprite Cherry would be niceBuglesLucky Charms milk after you ate the cereal out of a different bowlBone brothNay:Any chunky soupCollagen smoothieCocktails with ice, like a spritzOatmealIllustration by Zak TebbalWhat are the best stadium drinks that aren\u2019t beer? \u2014Dehydrated DoreenI think that the flavor of $15 bottled water is extra refreshing on a summer afternoon at the ballpark, but maybe that\u2019s resentment I\u2019m tasting. The answer varies, depending on what stadium you\u2019re at, but if you see someone carrying a drink you want\u2014Is that a frozen daiquiri in a two-foot plastic souvenir cup? Need!\u2014ask them where they got it. Otherwise you\u2019ll circle the park and never, ever find it. There\u2019s a taco spot in Comerica Park in Detroit where I like to get a $17 margarita, but the only way to find it is to follow me; it\u2019s over here somewhere....Illustration by Zak TebbalWeirdest but best hot dog toppings? I need inspiration. \u2014Zany ZooeyAn inside source told me they get nacho cheese and pickled jalape\u00f1os on their hot dogs, and at that moment the world\u2019s possibilities opened up to me like never before. See also: crab dip and mac \u2019n\u2019 cheese. Then there\u2019s beer spilled by the person behind you, which adds unexpected yeasty barley notes and helps the dry bun go down easy.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIs It Ever OkayCultureRecipes you want to make.
