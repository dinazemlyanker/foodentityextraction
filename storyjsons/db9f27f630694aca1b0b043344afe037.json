It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Lazy knifeworkSounds like the title of an unreleased thriller about a line cook with a taste for murder (AGENTS, CALL ME). But in fact, it is the best part of a beef-and-ginger stir fry that Christina Chaey made this week. \u201cThe thing I deeply love about that recipe,\u201d she said, \u201cis it\u2019s got the laziest possible knifework. Slice ginger, slice onions, slice beef, done.\u201d I watched on Instagram Stories as she tossed everything about and when I saw those onion rings, I knew what I was cooking this weekend.Make it: Beef and Ginger Stir-FryWant this letter before it hits the website?

And this year, we did EIGHT covers, each a different editor holding a succulent roast turkey (cooked in parts\u2014oh yes, it\u2019s happening). The editors are the stars of Making Perfect: Thanksgiving, which is now on Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s Roku and Apple TV channel\u2014this is how we make money, people\u2014and then rolling out weekly on YouTube. The magazine covers are photographed artfully chin-down, so Rachel Karten started taking photos of staffers around the office completing the cover with their own faces. See below\u2014and then take yours.Watch it: Making Perfect: ThanksgivingSubscribe: The magazine\u2019s on sale for $10 right now, just sayin\u2019.Overheard in the Test Kitchen\u201cPeople aren\u2019t ready for dried fruit in soup.\u201d \u2014Andy BaraghaniPHOTO BY ALEX LAU, FOOD STYLING BY REBECCA JURKEVICH, PROP STYLING BY KALEN KAMINSKIGo all outI was in Detroit last weekend for a very special golf tournament that raised money for my partner\u2019s dad\u2019s cancer doctor + research team at the University of Michigan. In between getting experimental cancer treatments approved (but mostly denied) by evil insurance companies, Big B has been eating as much as possible while he has regained taste buds and appetite. And so we came to FEAST (and watch DVRed Jeopardy!). What was the most dramatic meat we could cook? Chris Morocco\u2019s epic roast beef, DOUBLED. \u201cDid you guys win the lottery?\u201d Chris asked. Well, depends on how you look at it. Keep an eye on the temperature, he told me. We dropped some coin on strip loin and cooked that roast for hours and then broiled it for the final browning. On the side we had 8 lbs. of Andy\u2019s buttery, garlic-infused mashed potatoes, his lemon-zesty salami bites with Marcona almonds as an appetizer, Konbi\u2019s shishito pepper-pistachio dip, roasted carrots, and a big salad. I\u2019m not done!! For DESSERT, I baked Four and Twenty Blackbirds\u2019 salted caramel apple pie, which was as over the top as it sounds. And lemon bars for a palate cleanser. Crowd your house with people you love, eat like you won the lottery, and carry on.Sit back and clapI loved this Glamour feature about 12 people changing the food world.RICKWhenever Rick Martinez is in the Test Kitchen, my heart lights up. He\u2019s just so infectiously happy, and maybe that\u2019s from all the cookies (his nickname is \u201cSugar Man\u201d), but it\u2019ll turn your day around. He was making tortillas for an upcoming Healthyish recipe. \u201cI miss the bacon fat,\u201d he sighed. But that reminds me, we do have a recipe for bacon fat tortillas, which Rick made on camera here. See him staring lovingly at the frying bacon, above. That could be you.Make \u2018em: Taco Norte\u00f1os with Bacon-Fat Flour TortillasAlex LauWhat\u2019s Jesse cooking\u201cAtrocious monkey bread,\u201d said Jesse, who took on Claire Saffitz\u2019s cinnamon-syrupy recipe last weekend. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked (picture me as Lucy behind the psychiatrist booth). \u201cSome of the top got stuck in the pan while I was unmolding it, and I think there was a yeast issue. I\u2019m gonna write a personal essay titled \u2018Yeast Taught Me, a Perfectionist, Everything I Needed to Know About Failure.\u2019\u201d Then he made Claire\u2019s apple cake a second time.Bake it: Monkey Bread OR Apple-Walnut Upside-Down CakeLook at all the readers also making Claire\u2019s apple cake!How many times do I have to write about this \u2018til y\u2019all make it!Unnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekAlex LauIt\u2019s October, my black cat\u2019s birthday, and the time of year I want to buy a bag of caramel apple lollipops, ONE of the greatest Halloween candies of all time. I said one! But the food they\u2019re inspired by\u2014not so great. IMO, they\u2019re difficult to eat and I\u2019d rather buy a tub of dulce de leche, slice my own apple, and dip each slice individually, and generously. Matt Hunzinger agrees, with a meme:\u201ctired: full caramel apple (impossible to eat)wired: sliced apples with caramel to dip\u201dCarla Lalli Music is also a hater: \u201cLast time I checked I didn\u2019t want to rip out all of my teeth and get gluey caramel syrup all over my face and in my hair at the same time.\u201d Adam Rapoport reports: \u201cThe apples are mealy on the inside. People like the look, the notion of them, but no one likes to eat them.\u201d But Hilary Cadigan LOVES caramel apples, especially after corn dogs and/or a turkey leg. Cadigan the carnie! \u201cHate,\u201d said Sarah Jampel. \u201cDifficult to eat,\u201d said Sasha Levine. \u201cCaramel apples are SITUATIONALLY delicious,\u201d defended the scholar Jesse Sparks. \u201cI feel like people are mad that they\u2019re eating caramel apples in bad circumstances.\u201d Molly Baz went \u201csoul-searching and found nothing.\u201d Meryl Rothstein jumped in: \u201cI think a lot of you are conflating candied apples with caramel apples but both are not good.\u201d Andy Baraghani is \u201cinto them. And then I run to the dentist and deny, deny, deny.\u201dLove \u2018em?
