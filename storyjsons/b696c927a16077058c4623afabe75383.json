In reality, making dinner most nights feels like an off-brand version of Chopped in which I spend a lot of time gazing into my fridge, then just end up throwing a bunch of things in a bowl. But even on the darkest fridge days (a.k.a. rent week), I can rely on this crispy tofu to come through.Stop! If you\u2019re an avowed tofu hater, don\u2019t you dare close this tab. This recipe will turn you\u2014I\u2019ve seen it before. I\u2019ll admit that, in the wrong hands, tofu can be bland and stodgy. But this tofu is crispy and chewy, with a custard-y interior and hugely flavorful maple-soy glaze. What\u2019s not to love?I would be embarrassed about how often I\u2019ve made this recipe since it debuted on Healthyish last February, but senior food editor Chris Morocco is a genius so I have no shame. It\u2019s been in heavy rotation for months because all of the key ingredients\u2014maple syrup, soy sauce, rice vinegar, tofu\u2014are pantry staples for me. If tofu hasn\u2019t earned a permanent place on your grocery list, this recipe offers a compelling reason. It\u2019s affordable, keeps unopened in the fridge for weeks, and becomes crispy and delicious under that maple-soy glaze. And, like Rihanna, it will bless anything it touches.About that glaze: It\u2019s not as scary as you think. It\u2019s a simple mix of ginger, soy sauce, rice vinegar, maple syrup, and mild chile flakes, which bastes crispy browned tofu until reduced in a sticky, delicious sauce. It delivers takeout-joint level satisfaction, but can be totally accomplished in your PJs at home.Really, the best thing about this tofu treatment is how versatile it is. I tend to follow a simple formula: tofu + grains + vegetables. Think white rice or even soba noodles, shaved daikon or crunchy Persian cucumbers. I\u2019ve used this crispy tofu to round out a rice bowl with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and gomae, but you can\u2019t really go wrong here. Just don't forget the sliced scallions, which are a must\u2014they\u2019ll tie together any fridge scraps into a next-level tofu bowl you\u2019ll be stoked to eat any day.Get your glaze on:Crispy Tofu With Maple-Soy GlazeWhenever you\u2019re cooking tofu, here\u2019s one of our no-fail techniques: Draining the tofu, then squeezing out as much water as possible (without smashing it), is the key to the crispiest cubes.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyNever FailTofuRead MoreTofu and Mushroom Stir-FryRecipes you want to make.
