We prefer slicing them thinly and eating them raw with a simple dressing, like this creamy, tangy buttermilk one. If you can find them, use tender, first-of-the-year peas in this raw salad; they can get starchy and tough later in the season.Ingredients4 servings\u00becup buttermilk3Tbsp. plain whole-milk Greek yogurt2Tbsp. fresh lemon juice1small garlic clove, finely gratedA large pinch of kosher salt8oz. sugar snap peas, strings removed, thinly sliced2Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more1tsp. finely grated lemon zest, plus moreFlaky sea saltFreshly ground black pepperPreparationStep 1Whisk buttermilk, yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, and a large pinch of kosher salt in a medium bowl.

I didn't have buttermilk, so I used milk with a teaspoon of cider vinegar - worked perfectly.  I would have never thought to slice these peas raw for a salad.
