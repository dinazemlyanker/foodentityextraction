Only during quarantine have I started using it myself, marking new territory with soffritto stains on the pages my mother managed to keep pristine all these years. I turn to it when I want to taste my grandmother\u2019s and great-grandmother\u2019s cooking with half of the effort. One of my go-tos is Ortiz\u2019s guava barbecue sauce. Ortiz's recipe is wildly simple (four ingredients) with a single sentence procedure: \u2018Thoroughly combine all the ingredients.\u2019 It takes about five seconds to make but instantly conjures memories of childhood trips to the island, stopping at a kiosko for a pincho de pollo (chicken skewer) and licking the sticky sweet sauce from off my little fingers. My version is nothing like the original but it still brings me back just the same. I\u2019ve slathered this sauce on ribs and whole fish and used it as a glaze for pork belly, but I will always like it best with chicken. This is just to say, you might want to double it.\u201dAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Diamond Crystal or 1\u00be tsp. Morton kosher salt, 1 Tbsp. garlic powder, 1 Tbsp. ground coriander, 1 Tbsp. ground cumin, 2 tsp. dried oregano, and 2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper in a small bowl. Generously sprinkle seasoning all over 8\u201312 large chicken drumsticks or 4 thighs and 4 drumsticks (about 3 lb.). Let sit while you make the barbecue sauce. (If you have time, arrange chicken on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet and let chill, uncovered, overnight.)Step 2Assemble your ingredients: Chop 8-oz. guava or quince paste into \u00bd\" cubes (if using 8 oz. guava jelly, just add directly below, no need to prep). Peel and finely chop one 2\" piece ginger and 2 garlic cloves. Finely chop 1 canned chipotle chile in adobo sauce.Step 3Bring guava paste, ginger, garlic, chipotle chile, \u00bd cup apple cider vinegar, \u2153 cup spiced or dark rum, 3 Tbsp. fresh lime juice, 3 Tbsp. ketchup, 1 Tbsp. soy sauce, \u00bd tsp. ground allspice and \u00bc cup water to a simmer in a medium pot over medium-high heat, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and continue simmering, stirring occasionally, until guava melts and sauce is thick but pourable, about 10 minutes. Scoop out \u00bd cup sauce and set aside for serving.Step 4If grilling, prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Grill chicken, turning occasionally, until lightly charred, 15\u201320 minutes. Baste chicken with guava sauce and continue grilling, turning and basting often (try to use most, if not all, of the sauce) and moving to a cooler part of the grill if you have flare-ups, until cooked through and an instant-read thermometer registers at least 165\u00b0 (we like the extra tenderness of bringing it to 175\u00b0, so feel free to go a bit further), 8\u201310 minutes longer.Step 5If baking, place a rack in very top position of oven and remaining rack in the middle. Heat broiler. Line a large baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack inside. Arrange chicken on rack and broil, undisturbed, until charred in spots, 5\u20137 minutes. Remove chicken from oven and turn over. Broil until other side is charred in spots side, 3\u20135 minutes. Brush chicken with guava sauce. Reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0 and move chicken to middle rack. Bake 10 minutes. Turn over and brush with more sauce. Continue cooking, basting with more sauce every few minutes (try to use most, if not all, of the sauce), until an instant-read thermometer registers 165\u00b0 (we like the extra tenderness of bringing it to 175\u00b0, so feel free to go a bit further), 20\u201325 minutes longer.Step 6Transfer chicken to a platter and let rest 5\u201310 minutes. Serve with reserved guava sauce for dipping.Step 7Do ahead: Sauce can be made 1 week ahead.
