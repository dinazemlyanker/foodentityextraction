These are filled with a salty-buttery mix of chopped mushrooms, such as earthy shiitake, shimeji, and enoki. All are easy to find in Asian supermarkets, but you can also use crimini or button mushrooms with great results. Just make sure to cut the mushrooms into fairly small pieces so they can eventually fit inside the rice balls.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Reduce heat to low, cover pan, and cook until water is evaporated and rice is tender, 18\u201320 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit, covered, 10 minutes. Fluff rice with a rice paddle or fork, cover again, and let sit until ready to use.Step 2Melt butter in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add all of the mushrooms, season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add soy sauce, sake, and oil and simmer, tossing occasionally, until liquid is reduced to a glossy sauce that coats mushrooms, about 2 minutes. Stir in shichimi togarashi. Transfer to a small bowl and let cool.Step 3Set up a workstation with a small bowl of water, a small bowl of salt, cooked rice (it should still be warm but cool enough to handle), mushroom mixture, and nori.Step 4To make 1 omusubi, scoop \u00bd cup rice onto a work surface. Dip your hands in water to moisten, then rub them with a little salt. (This prevents the rice from sticking to your hands as you work and also flavors the omusubi.) Cupping rice in your nondominant hand, make a shallow well in the center of the rice mound and fill with a heaping tablespoonful of mushroom mixture. Using your hands and moistening as needed to prevent rice from sticking, gently but firmly shape rice into a ball, fully enclosing mushroom mixture. Place rice ball back on surface and flatten lightly. Using the side of a wet chef\u2019s knife, gently push into a triangle shape. Wrap in a sheet of nori and sprinkle with furikake. Repeat with remaining rice, mushroom filling, and nori.How would you rate Omusubi With Soy-Butter Mushrooms?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (3)Back to TopTriangleI have made this recipe twice now. First time, I made an omusubi at the counter and popped it in my mouth one after another after another, delectable. Second time, I platted nine to munch on and watch a movie. I do prefer the informality of eating them before they even touch the plate. The mushrooms stay warm and tender, along with the omusubi. But either way, delicious and interesting way to use up leftover mushrooms, just chop them fine :)MadelineReno, NV3/4/2022So yummy and easy to makeAnonymousCorvallis, OR9/22/2021This looks good!Ruben BillingsSanta Clarita, CA9/20/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titMushroomVegetableRiceRice & GrainsJapaneseEast AsianAsianRecipes you want to make.
