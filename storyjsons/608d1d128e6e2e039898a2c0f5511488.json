Some of the healthier items, like chia pudding and the \u201cbig healthy salad,\u201d feel like a welcome reprieve from poutine.THE VIBE IS: sunny and cheerful. The service is perfunctory but polite; the staff is accustomed to getting both locals and tourists efficiently in and out.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Brunch is served only on weekends, so expect a wait, but don\u2019t fear: The line moves quickly.\u2014Claire SaffitzMicka\u00ebl BandassakMicka\u00ebl BandassakWE ALSO LOVEFoxyA perennially packed wood-fired hangout in GriffintownLarrysA natural wine bar that also serves the best breakfast in Mile EndPatisserie Au Kouign-AmannA carby, sugary haven in the PlateauExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
