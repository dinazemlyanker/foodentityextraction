This recipe, inspired by that meal, features a whole fish rubbed with a spice blend reminiscent of mchuzi mix, a seasoning popular in Kenya and other parts of Africa, then fried and served with peppery piri-piri sauce. Whole fish, while dramatic in appearance, are actually a lot more forgiving to cook than boneless fillets, which can overcook and dry out easily. Look for a fish around 2 lb. so it will fit into a wok or skillet and cook through relatively quickly.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Cook bell pepper, shallot, garlic, chile, and ginger, stirring occasionally, until softened and golden brown in spots, 5\u20138 minutes. Transfer to a blender. Add vinegar, dried thyme, sugar, and 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt; pur\u00e9e until smooth. Season sauce with more vinegar and/or salt if needed. Transfer to a small bowl.Fish and assemblyStep 2Grind coriander, fennel, cumin, and fenugreek seeds in a spice mill or with a mortar and pestle to a fine powder (it won\u2019t be as fine with mortar and pestle); transfer to a small bowl. Mix in garlic powder, paprika, sugar, turmeric, MSG (if using), and 4 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 2\u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt, then stir in vinegar to make a paste.Step 3Place fish on a cutting board; pat dry. Using a knife, make slashes crosswise every 2\" along body of fish, cutting all the way down to the bones. Turn over and repeat on other side. Season fish all over with salt, including inside cavity and slashes. Rub spice paste over fish, tucking some into slashes. Pour rice flour onto a rimmed baking sheet. Coat fish evenly in rice flour, shaking off any excess.Step 4Heat oil in a large wok or cast-iron skillet over medium-high until an instant-read thermometer registers 365\u00b0. Grip a fish by the tail and carefully lower, head first, into wok, making sure to lay it down away from you and releasing gently. Fry until cooked through and skin is deeply browned and crisp, about 4 minutes per side (use tongs and a fish spatula to turn). Transfer to a wire rack. Repeat with second fish. Sprinkle lightly with salt.Step 5Serve fish with sauce and lime wedges.How would you rate Fried Fish With Piri-Piri Sauce?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (1)Back to TopTrianglesurbhi reviewAnonymousindia1/20/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titDinnerMainSeafoodFishTilapiaBassAfricanEast AfricanFryRecipes you want to make.
