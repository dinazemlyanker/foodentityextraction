This streamlined version skips the traditional process of pounding the ingredients in a clay mortar and wooden pestle; instead, you cut and chop the ingredients more thinly and finely, then use your hand to mix and squeeze them just until lightly wilted\u2014the way this salad is supposed to be.

A previous review mentioned an alternative to fish sauce. Soy sauce or Braggs Liquid Aminos would make a flavorful substitute both which are vegan.Chef KenBoquete, Panama10/12/2021A vegetarian  alternative to fish sauce would be appreciated, also dislike the taste of it! Any alternative?AnonymousAustin, TX8/25/2021This was so delicious! It definitely needed more fish sauce and lime. But I\u2019ll definitely add it to the rotation. Had it with roasted chicken.
