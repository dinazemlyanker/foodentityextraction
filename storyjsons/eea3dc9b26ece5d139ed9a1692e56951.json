But as my perspective has expanded and my knowledge of Ayurveda has increased, I\u2019ve learned that \u201cto cleanse\u201d can have a much deeper meaning. In Ayurveda, an ancient health science originating in India, cleansing is a practice that gives the digestive system an opportunity to rest, repair itself, and clear out waste and toxins\u2014without fasting. It can be particularly meaningful this time of year as we transition from cold, dark months of hibernation to the warm, bright months of growth ahead. Ayurveda generally tailors treatments to the individual, but here are a few cleansing tips that should help all body types take on this next season with more energy, strength, immunity, and mental clarity.Eat With the SeasonsNature provides us with what we need during a particular season. As we transition into spring, choose produce such as leafy greens, radishes, and celery. Nettle and dandelion are astringent, cleansing herbs perfect for this moment\u2014boil them in water to make a tea.More Spices, PleaseCumin, coriander, and fennel are good at aiding digestion (find my recipe for CCF tea here), so work those into your diet regularly. And this time of year, I cook with a lot of pungent warming spices\u2014specifically plenty of black pepper, ginger, and garam masala. They counter the cold wetness of the season, and are a balance to the elements we\u2019re exposed to externally.Ditch the Deep-FryJust as we leave behind the heavy dampness of winter, we want to leave behind heavy, greasy cooking. Rather than deep-fry food, I focus on roasting\u2014being mindful of the quantity of oil\u2014or steaming. Regardless of the season, during a cleanse you\u2019ll want to prioritize cooked foods over raw\u2014cooking helps break down foods, jump-starting the digestive process and leaving less for your body to do.Choose Olive OilWhen you do use oil, olive oil is a good choice because it\u2019s light (again, to counteract the season\u2019s heaviness), meaning it\u2019s easy for the body to digest. I use it not only to cook but also as part of a daily Abhyanga massage to help move toxins out of the body. If you\u2019re in a rush, focus on a five-minute dry scalp massage and an oil foot massage. That\u2019s where all your nerves start and end, so it\u2019s most effective in relieving tension throughout the body.Get Your Guggul OnAyurvedic adaptogens (herbs and roots that help the body combat stress) like guggul and triphala have lymph-clearing and digestive properties. Mix the powder with water or fruit juice and sip it before bed.Switch up Your GrainsWheat flour, corn, and rye are heavy grains that can weigh you down. In this season of lightness, cook with quinoa, barley, and amaranth.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSpringRead MoreshoppingI Can't Stop Munching On This Fluffy, Flavorful Popcorn DupeBy Amber GibsoncookingWhat Is Ghee, the Clarified Butter We Could Eat by the Spoon?By Aliza AbarbanelLifestyleDr. Sanjay Gupta Has Pretty Much Figured Out How to Live ForeverBy Alex BeggsLifestyleA Tool to Clean (Like Really Clean) Your TongueBy Sarah JampelRecipes you want to make.
