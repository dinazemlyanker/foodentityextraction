Half of my belongings were in boxes, and the other half remains the subject of an ongoing custody dispute with my old roommates (if you\u2019re reading this, Rachel, I want my pasta strainer back). While I\u2019m generally skeptical of all-in-one cooking tools, I\u2019m also more than willing to be convinced that one pan can truly do everything.Enter Our Place\u2019s Perfect Pot. You may recognize its cousin, the Always Pan, the colorful fry pan that seems omnipresent on social media (or on our website) and aims to combine eight different kitchen implements into one pretty package. What the Always Pan wanted to do for pan stuff, the Perfect Pot wants to do for pot stuff. According to the Our Place website, it\u2019s meant to replace your \u201cstockpot, Dutch oven, saucepot, roasting rack, steamer, strainer, braiser, and spoon rest.\u201d That was great news for me, because\u2014although I own all of those things\u2014I had no idea where any of them were. So I spent the past month or so cooking pretty much every meal (aside from takeout but including leftovers) in the Perfect Pot to see how it stacked up.After all that testing, I can confirm, on the record and for perpetuity, that the Perfect Pot is, in fact, a pot\u2014but it\u2019s not quite perfect. It\u2019s big, it\u2019s made of metal (mostly), it looks beautiful sitting on my stove, and it has room for a lot of ingredients and liquids inside of it. It does most pot stuff really well\u2014you\u2019ll have no trouble making stock, boiling pasta, cooking soups, poaching, blanching, or anything of the sort. I also liked its steaming tray, which is easier to clean and more intuitive to use than those complicated baskets that fold into themselves like the metal cities from The Legend of Korra.It\u2019s when the Perfect Pot deviated from pot-related activities that I started running into problems. Some of the design choices that try to elevate the Perfect Pot into something beyond an attractive, functional pot actually get in the way of its core duties. It\u2019s an undeniably pretty piece of kitchen equipment\u2014much like the Always Pan\u2014and there\u2019s something to be said for good design. Still, aesthetics only matter up to a point, and whether that point is above the $165 price tag isn\u2019t a decision I can make for you. What I can do is tell you how it fared at all of the tasks it claims to perform and point out the ways that the Perfect Pot left me wanting more, wanting less, or just wanting answers.Our Place Perfect Pot$165 at Our PlaceScore: 7/10Pros:Great for kitchens short on space thanks to its multiuse capabilities.Steaming tray is easy to use, clean, and store.Oven-to-table design and attractive colorways make for a stylish serving vessel.Cons:Nonstick coating can make some braising recipes difficult to follow.Maximum temperature of 425\u00b0 is too low for some baking recipes that call for Dutch ovens\u2014this is not your sourdough pot.Longevity concerns because of the nonstick coating and the exterior color.The BasicsThe Perfect Pot is a 5.5-quart pot with nonstick interior, solid aluminum construction, and a few bells and whistles to set it apart from a classic Dutch oven. Inside the box, you\u2019ll find the pot itself, a notched beechwood spoon designed to rest steadily across the pot\u2019s handle, a combination roasting/steaming rack that nestles in the bottom of the pot, and a nonstick safe dehydrated sponge that expands in water like those growing Dino-Capsules from when you were a kid (once the included scrubber gets yucky, Our Place\u2019s website mentions that you can safely use any soft sponge on the pot\u2019s surface).Our Place is known for their artful design skills, which definitely show in the Perfect Pot. While it doesn\u2019t have as many color options as the flagship Always Pan, there are still six stylish hues\u2014including the ever-popular sage green\u2014that coordinate with Our Place\u2019s dishware and glasses. I got mine in Blue Salt, and although the color has faded a bit in the past couple months, it\u2019s still pretty enough in my book to place right on the dinner table when entertaining.What does the Perfect Pot do well?As a preface, I think the Perfect Pot is a solid piece of kitchen equipment. Most of the things that a good pot or Dutch oven does well are somewhat unglamorous and also nearly impossible to mess up. For example, I won\u2019t waste time talking about how good this pot is at boiling water, simmering stock, or making pasta\u2014because of course it can do those things.Outside of your basic pot duties, the main thing I\u2019ve kept using my Perfect Pot for\u2014even after I\u2019ve finished reviewing it\u2014is steaming. The Perfect Pot comes with a small perforated tray that functions as both a roasting rack and a steamer basket and fits snugly in its bottom without damaging the pot\u2019s nonstick coating. While the utility of a roasting rack this small was somewhat lost on me (I could barely fit an entire sliced potato on the 8.5\"-diameter rack), it works like a charm for steaming\u2014especially when I\u2019m cooking for one and don\u2019t want to deal with a full-size steamer. My Perfect Pot is a powerhouse for cooking dumplings, shellfish, veggies, you name it, with minimal stickage to boot. Once everything\u2019s cooled down, that tiny tray is a breeze to clean and can be stored inside of the Perfect Pot to save space.I also have to compliment the design of this device. Like most Our Place gear, it\u2019s very pretty to look at, in a hip, 2021 minimalist way, and it feels like a piece of well-oiled machinery in my hands. An incredible amount of thoughtfulness and artistry clearly went into making this pot a reality, and as someone who dropped out of engineering school after one semester, I appreciate when that much effort goes into anything. While I may balk at Our Place\u2019s assertion that the Perfect Pot\u2019s cleverly notched spoon\u2014which locks onto the pot\u2019s handle like a Lincoln Log\u2014will \u201creplace\u201d your spoon rest (as if a spoon rest really takes up an inordinate amount of space), it is an incredibly convenient trick.I love the oversized pouring spout, which makes dumping leftovers into deli containers quick and easy while minimizing spillage. Its lid also has a strainer built into it, although the holes are a bit too large to catch smaller grains like quinoa. The handles are plus-size, which makes carrying the pot or pulling it from the oven a bit safer while wearing oven mitts on both hands. It\u2019s also compatible with your induction cooktop, which could easily be the way of the future.About that nonstick coating\u2026Like the Our Place Always Pan, the Perfect Pot is lined with a slick nonstick ceramic coating. I fried eggs, crisped up bacon, seared chicken breasts, and saut\u00e9ed plenty of veggies in the bottom of my Perfect Pot to see how it would fare, and I have to say it was one of the better nonstick surfaces I\u2019ve ever used. Our Place boasts that the lining is made \u201cwithout potentially toxic materials like PFOAs, PTFEs, other PFAs, lead, cadmium, toxic metals, and nanoparticles,\u201d which I recently learned are scary from Last Week Tonight With John Oliver, so that\u2019s a breath of fresh air for the hypochondriac in me.But why is the Perfect Pot nonstick in the first place? When it comes to braising, which is one of my favorite things to do in a pot, sticking isn\u2019t always a bad thing. On the contrary, many of my favorite braised recipes rely on ingredients leaving a fond (those brown crispies that get stuck to the pan) as they sear, which you deglaze later on with wine or soy sauce or stock to incorporate those caramelized flavors into your braising liquid. That process brings depth to the sauce and makes everything taste warm and cohesive and cozy and generally delicious. I would much rather be able to do that in a big, bulky stockpot than be able to fry eggs in it, an activity that\u2014in retrospect\u2014felt pretty ridiculous.For most tasks where I\u2019d use a pot\u2014simmering, steaming, boiling, poaching\u2014a nonstick coating is pretty much irrelevant. It doesn\u2019t hurt, but it doesn\u2019t really help either. And given that long-term reviewers of the Always Pan have expressed concerns about the longevity of its nonstick surface, it feels like an odd and unnecessary inclusion for the Perfect Pot.Can the Our Place Perfect Pot replace my Dutch oven?The Perfect Pot looks like a Dutch oven, in many ways it acts like a Dutch oven, and Our Place claims it can replace your Dutch oven\u2014but I wouldn\u2019t throw out your Le Creuset just yet. Like I mentioned, the nonstick coating isn\u2019t ideal for some braising recipes, but that\u2019s not the only issue I\u2019ve run into so far. If you use a Dutch oven to bake bread, for example, the Perfect Pot is only oven-safe to 425\u00b0, which is short of the 450\u2013500\u00b0 range we recommend for our BA\u2019s Best Bread recipe. King Arthur Flour also recommends cooking sourdough at 450\u00b0, just beyond the Perfect Pot\u2019s maximum temperature.Unlike standard Dutch ovens, which are usually made of cast iron and enamel, the Perfect Pot is made from lightweight aluminum. This means it heats up quicker than a traditional Dutch oven might, which is great for weeknight cooking or any situation where you want responsive temperature control\u2014I made a carbonara in mine and experienced zero egg-scramblage after cutting the heat\u2014but that comes at the cost of less heat retention and durability compared to a common Dutch oven.For comparison\u2019s sake, the enamel-lined cast-iron Dutch oven from Lodge I normally use can safely reach 500\u00b0. It\u2019s great for searing, baking, and braising. It\u2019s heavy-duty too: I\u2019ve put the enamel through some pretty serious abuse over the years, and so far it\u2019s shown no signs of chipping. Unlike that tank of a cast-iron dish, I feel like I need to baby the Perfect Pot to preserve its nonstick coating. Our Place specifically recommends a quick wash with a soft sponge (like the one that comes included with the pot), but that leaves me worried about tougher messes and stains.Lodge 6-Quart Dutch Oven$115 $80 at Amazon$80 at TargetIs the Perfect Pot Worth It?At $165, the Perfect Pot has some pretty fierce competition. The Lodge Dutch oven mentioned above costs about half as much, leaving you with enough cash to buy a stainless-steel stockpot or a nice nonstick pan\u2014rather than frying all of your eggs in the same eight-in-one basket, so to speak. If you bake a lot of bread or want the perfect vessel for braising and deglazing, it\u2019s probably not the pot for you given its temperature restrictions and compromises from its non-stick coating.On the other hand, if cabinet and shelf space are major concerns in your kitchen, or you\u2019re looking to downsize, the Perfect Pot is a strong option thanks to its multifunctional bona fides. It\u2019s certainly capable of almost everything you would expect to use it for, and clever features like the steaming tray, plus-size pouring spout, and induction capabilities could be enough to justify the price tag. As a semi-recent grad myself, I\u2019ll definitely say it\u2019s a solid choice for someone building out their first kitchen\u2014it will satisfy your needs while still leaving you with room to grow as a chef. With dinner parties on their way back, it also makes a gorgeous serving dish, competitively priced with other stylish options like the Great Jones Dutchess and the minimalist Kana Milo Dutch oven, which makes it a good pick for frequent entertainers.Milo by Kana 5.5 Quart Dutch Oven$135 at Amazon$135 at KanaNo pot will ever be everything to everyone, and nothing in this world is truly \u201cperfect,\u201d no matter what anyone tells you. But the Perfect Pot, imperfect as it may be, is still a brilliantly designed and unique piece of cookware with lots going for it. And even though I\u2019ve stopped using it for everything I do, it\u2019s earned its place on my stovetop, my dinner table, and my Instagram page\u2014right next to my other Dutch oven.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingRecipes you want to make.
