Even now I feel fairly certain that if I ever stop working for more than 45 minutes I\u2019ll lose my health insurance, bring a curse upon my loved ones, get into an exciting freak accident, and then die.But after about a month of trying to activate my book muscles when I was\u2014to use a rather old-fashioned phrase\u2014\u201cdone with work for the day,\u201d I realized that my attempts to demarcate one project from another were (at best) not working and (if I\u2019m being real) terribly sad. Techniques such as \u201cwashing my face at 4 p.m.\u201d and \u201cchanging from day sweatpants into night sweatpants\u201d radiated desperation and unconvincing performance. It was like putting a checkout divider between a wedge of aged Gouda and a bottle of Clorox when the cashier at the grocery store definitely knows I\u2019m going to ingest both of them later that night.And so I concluded, as many have before me, that the solution involved getting out of the city. Such was the genesis of the only real writing ritual that I\u2019ve ever developed: taking the Metro-North to Poughkeepsie on a Thursday afternoon, renting a car near the train station, picking up groceries, driving to the cheapest place I could find on Airbnb with a wood stove and a kitchen, and spending the next four days subsisting on a healthy variety of marijuana edibles and a strong third to half-pound of pasta per meal.I\u2019m not kidding when I say this routine made me feel like Gwyneth Paltrow. To me it was a secret pinnacle of spiritual, emotional, and physical wellness. It was a cross between a boot camp and a slacker\u2019s vacation. It was hiking in the sunlight and muttering \u201cwhoa\u201d after 12 minutes of staring at embers and grinding black pepper out of a stranger\u2019s sky-blue ceramic pepper mill into a shimmering lake of olive oil inside an unfamiliar dented pan.In my favorite of all these tiny backyard guesthouses, the lights were warm and low in the kitchen; the table was just big enough for two red placemats and a candle; there were old pennants hanging on the walls and owls hooting in the yard. I grated myself a soft snow pile of Pecorino, shook it over a swirled nest of spaghetti, and served myself a huge bowl of sharp, indulgent cacio e pepe. I slurped, splattering sauce on Anna Karenina, which was open to the part where Oblonsky was ordering roast beef and oysters, and remembered how I could avalanche myself with pleasure if I tried.These weekends, which I took at the beginning of each month, were the full expression of all the compulsions within me that are unshareable by definition: to be lavishly alone; to eat in priestly silence; to stay up late reading; to think in the morning and write all night. Each trip was similar\u2014the train, the car, the work, the pasta\u2014but each thing was a little different every time.Illustration by Clay HicksonOnce in October, it was raining, and I got a splinter walking barefoot across the rough wood floor. I started a fire in the early afternoon, and made spaghetti carbonara my favorite way, slipping a molehill of garlic into the eggs. I chopped Parmesan with a knife because I couldn\u2019t find a grater, crisped bacon in quantities I would\u2019ve had to explain had anyone else been present, and finished the whole pot in a day and a half.A few months later, in January, it was bluebird skies and frosty. I was staying at an impersonal, spooky rental property in the hills around Minnewaska State Park, reading chemical analyses of the MDMA molecule, and trying not to get freaked out by the lack of phone service. It was a relief to focus my attention on something right in front of me: celery and carrots, browning to caramel for a white wine Bolognese.Without these trips I\u2019d never have finished my book, mainly because I would have lost my grip on the reason I wanted to write it in the first place. Underneath the structural conditions that I spend my professional life both objecting and yielding to, writing is fundamentally a matter of pleasure for me. More than that, it\u2019s a comfort. It is the self-perpetuating solace of discovering, over and over, that you don\u2019t need much\u2014you hardly need any equipment, you can get it done in strange places\u2014to be satisfied, or even, occasionally, thrilled.Of course, the same goes for making and eating pasta. And on these weekends, the two became parallel acts for me. I grated parm with a highlighter in my mouth; I inhaled rigatoni the way I was working\u2014until it was too much, but the good kind of too much, and it was time to go to bed.There are many ways, too, in which making pasta is a far better pastime than writing. Every time I \u201cget my materials together\u201d for a piece, I seem to end up spending two hours on the Wikipedia page for Smilodons, which, as we all know, are the most famous prehistoric saber-toothed cats, reaching up to 880 pounds in their largest iteration. But I can get in and out of a Hannaford supermarket with everything I need for sausage-and-broccoli orecchiette in six minutes flat.Every time I sit down to write something, I understand that the likely outcome is that it\u2019s going to be awful. Conversely, after you\u2019ve made a pasta once, you\u2019ll probably get better at it. Unlike with writing, pasta will only ever be more precisely like what you wanted it to be. When you\u2019ve spent all day wading through the swamp of your own inadequacies, there\u2019s no absolution like spaghetti dripping in pepper and cheese. And it was the spaghetti that reminded me, before the writing did, that the way we do things matters. If we cook the way we want to, we eat the way we want to. If something is absorbing to produce, it will be absorbing to consume. And even if you don\u2019t end up with anything you ever want to share with other people, you\u2019ll still have made something\u2014and this is all you can hope for\u2014for yourself.Jia Tolentino is a staff writer at the New Yorker and the author of the essay collection Trick Mirror.
