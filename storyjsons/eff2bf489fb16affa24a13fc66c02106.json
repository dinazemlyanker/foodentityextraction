The same salad. Iceberg lettuce, some underripe tomatoes, and a few cucumber coins. \u201cEat your salad or you don\u2019t get dessert.\u201d That was the refrain.Finishing it was easy, in that it didn\u2019t really taste like much\u2014other than the Thousand Island dressing that my brother and sister and I glopped on top.I don\u2019t mean to throw my mom under the bus. She was a top-notch home cook, and still is. But back in the day in Washington, D.C., let\u2019s just say that she wasn\u2019t exactly, to borrow a current restaurantism, \u201cvegetable forward.\u201d A native Wisconsinite, she had a repertoire of meatloaf and mashed potatoes, brisket, breaded veal chops for my dad\u2019s birthday. As kids, my brother and sister would fight over the crispy bacon strips affixed atop the weekly meatloaf. They were good days.You can make the Brassicas Bowl from Two Hands at home.\nLaura MurrayFast-forward to 2018.As I write this letter, I\u2019m sitting in an exceptionally cheery Aussie-owned, all-day caf\u00e9 in Tribeca called Two Hands. I\u2019m eating what the menu terms a Brassicas Bowl\u2014a tangle of kale, shaved brussels, and charred broccolini; a jammy 7-minute egg; half an avocado; and a swoosh of hummus. Which, as it happens, is basically what I made for dinner the previous night, swapping in some farro and roasted butternut squash.Not that I eat this way all the time. I firmly inherited my parents\u2019 penchant for the meaty things in life. My ten-year-old son will tell you that I make the best smash burger in New York City, and I\u2019m not going to argue with him.But the breadth of ingredients that I reach for in my kitchen these days is kind of astounding. By going to restaurants like Two Hands and its wave of sunlit siblings, I now come home asking my wife whether we shouldn\u2019t be stirring tahini into our salad dressing. And why aren\u2019t we spooning labneh onto our plates like nearly every cookbook author in America? And how exactly does one cook with turmeric?Not that these ingredients or techniques are new; they\u2019ve been around for millennia. But they\u2019re now easily accessible in the States. And in that inimitable American fashion, professional chefs and home cooks alike are incorporating them in ways that are, at times, \u201cauthentic\u201d and other times not. What matters to us here at BA is that they're always delicious.Crudite as done at Healthyish spot De Maria:Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishVegetarianessayRead Morerecipes60 Vegan Dinner Recipes That We Just LoveGallery60 SlidesBy The Healthyish TeamRecipes you want to make.
