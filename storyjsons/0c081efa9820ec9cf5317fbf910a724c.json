Then squeezing expels more water and relaxes them into a crunchy-but-silky state. A final seasoning then has even more impact: The veg have been primed to absorb the rice vinegar and salt.Ingredients4 servings6cups thinly shaved or sliced radishes\u00bcwhite onion, very thinly slicedKosher salt\u00bccup seasoned rice vinegar2Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oilPreparationStep 1Combine vegetables and onion in a medium bowl; season generously with salt. Let sit until they start to release their water, 8\u201310 minutes, then begin to massage, gently at first so they don\u2019t break, then harder as they begin to expel their liquid, until softened to about the texture of coleslaw. Pour off all excess liquid and add vinegar and oil; toss to coat. Taste and season with more salt if needed.Step 2Do Ahead: Slaw can be made 3 days ahead.
