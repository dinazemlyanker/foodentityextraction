Then there are subjectively good things, based on your personal preferences. (Mine just so happen to be the episode of Jersey Shore where they go on vacation to Riccione, Italy and biting into a still-warm slice from Scarr\u2019s, if you wanted some examples). A factually good thing versus something you as an individual can\u2019t get enough of. And when it comes to objectively good versus subjectively good in the realm of Thanksgiving, this stuffing falls into the objectively good category. (If you don\u2019t believe me, just ask the legion of other BA staffers who have been making this stuffing year after year.)First, let\u2019s start with the fact that it gets cooked outside of the bird. When you cook stuffing in the bird, it\u2019ll never get crispy. And while it\u2019s true that stuffing is all about that wonderful custardy, soggy texture, I\u2019d like to argue that the soggy is nothing without the crunchy\u2014a bite of both is, objectively-speaking, perfection. Because you bake this one uncovered for the last 40 minutes, the top layer of craggly pieces of torn bread crisp while the middle of the stuffing remains custardy.Speaking of that custardy inside, it happens because of eggs and lots of broth. I\u2019m not going to sit here on my broth-covered throne (it\u2019s damp up here!) and tell you I\u2019ve only made this stuffing with homemade stock. I\u2019ve used the box stuff\u2014and it works! But if you are planning ahead, make some chicken broth this weekend and store it in your freezer until it\u2019s stuffing time.And as for the other stuff? It\u2019s onion and celery cooked in butter until lightly browned, then mixed with sage, parsley, rosemary, and thyme\u2014some objectively Thanksgiving-y herbs. So essentially, a lot of extremely simple ingredients get thrown together to make the best stuffing, and for that you can\u2019t be anything but objectively happy to scoop even more onto your almost-too-full Thanksgiving plate.Get the recipe:Simple Is Best DressingThis easy stuffing recipe, or dressing if you prefer, will be a staple on your Thanksgiving dinner menu for years to come.\u00a0View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titThanksgivingStuffingNever FailRecipes you want to make.
