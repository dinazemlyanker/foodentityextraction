But the lowly leek? When\u2019s the last time anyone lost their shit over them? Well this spring veg is also peaking right now, and you\u2019d be wise to make good use of them with this brand new Upside-Down Caramelized Leek Tart.The dish is a savory tarte tatin inspired by the flavors of classic leeks in vinaigrette. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my very favorite ways to eat leeks,\u201d says senior associate food editor Molly Baz, who developed the recipe. For those of you who have yet to discover the magic that is alliums roasted in bracingly acidic vinegar until golden and soft, get on it. But it gets better, because this recipe also employs (store bought!) flaky, buttery puff pastry, which makes it over-the-top delicious, visually stunning, and really freakin\u2019 easy.Have a slice. Or two.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesYou start by par-roasting your cleaned, trimmed leeks in the oven to get them part of the way cooked. \u201cFrom there, it all happens in one pan, building from the bottom up,\u201d says Molly. Simply simmer some white wine (or red or sherry) vinegar in a cast iron skillet. Then add a couple of tablespoons of butter, thyme leaves, and a teaspoon of sugar, just to coax along the caramelization. After this has cooled a bit, you lay down the roasted leeks in neat rows, keeping in mind that however they\u2019re organized on the bottom of your pan is how they will look on the top of your tart. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be crazy about it,\u201d Molly says of the arrangement. \u201cIf there\u2019s a gap, just cut a little piece of leek and fill it in.\u201d Brush the rounded side of the leeks with some mustard for a slightly spicy bite and sprinkle some grated parm over the top, which adds \u201ca fatty-salty vibe without turning it into an actually cheesy tart.\u201dThe puff gets rolled out until it\u2019s wide enough to cover the circumference of your pan and trimmed into a circle. I actually laid my dough on top of the pan and then imperfectly snipped off the corners with kitchen scissors. You tuck the sides underneath anyway, so it doesn\u2019t need to be exact. The pastry will, well, puff and surround your leeks once you slide it all into the oven.Forty minutes later, all you have to do is flip it over onto a plate, which sounds harder than it is. \u201cMake sure you have a surface that is larger than your pan,\u201d says Molly, \u201cand do it in one, swift, confident movement. If any leeks stick to the bottom of the pan, it\u2019s not a big deal. Just peel them off and lay them back on top of the tart. No one will ever know.\u201dWhat they will know is that you just served them a truly springy, visually impressive, melt-in-your mouth buttery-and-bright-all-at-the-same-time tart. They might even freak out about it.Get the recipe:Upside-Down Caramelized Leek TartYes, this is an impressive-looking, deliciously savory tart, and no, it\u2019s not at all difficult to make.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titSpringTartLeekRead MoreSpring MinestroneLifestyleThis Recipe Wants You to Know That Meatballs Are Totally Appropriate for SpringBy Amanda ShapirocultureThe Springy Spring Salad I\u2019m Making This WeekendBy Alex BeggsLifestyleThis Turmeric Yogurt Dip Is a Great Excuse to Load Up on Spring ProduceBy Seamus MullenRecipes you want to make.
