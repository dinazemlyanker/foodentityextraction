Or having to play \u201cstuff my collection of baking sheets and cutting boards into the clown car and hope it stays shut\u201d whenever I\u2019m putting dishes away. The cabinet next to my stove often wins this game. (The losers? My downstairs neighbors, who certainly hear everything tumbling out.)I know life doesn\u2019t have to be like this. In fits of revenge bedtime procrastination, I ogle organizers. I dream about big, colorful pegboards and a pot rack that slides smoothly out of the cabinet, but I\u2019ve written all those off as too much of an investment for a home I\u2019m only renting. But when a recent night of online window shopping brought me to youCopia\u2019s StoreMore Adjustable Bakeware Rack, I bit the bullet. A $20 ticket to peace, with no tools, screws, or stud finders needed\u2014could it be possible?YouCopia Bakeware Storage Rack$20 at AmazonWhen the package arrived, I took an early lunch break, eager to put it together. What drew me to youCopia\u2019s kitchen cabinet organizer over its slightly cheaper competitors were the adjustable wire dividers, which fit easily into a sturdy plastic base. It took a few seconds longer to set up than the racks with preset dividers since I had to eyeball the right distances for the big sheet pans and the half sheets and all the other stuff. But ultimately the ability to customize meant a better fit in my cabinet, which has a big pipe going through it (boooo), and flexibility if my equipment collection ever expands or changes.After a minute or so of tinkering, I placed the rack in the cabinet, with the big things on one side and smaller items like a cutting board fit for a single apple on the other. Between them, I ended up with the perfect space for the immersion blender and its attachments, for which I had long struggled to find a home. Order, it turns out, comes pretty quickly once there\u2019s a system for everything. I stepped back and marveled. Suddenly, I looked like a person with my act together.In the weeks since I\u2019ve found myself considering more sheet-pan meals; I use cutting boards other than the one that lives on the counter; and I no longer cast a stink eye at my wire cooling racks and their tiny projecting feet. Finally, I\u2019ve found peace\u2014at least in this little, stressful part of my life\u2014and all it took was a few minutes and a $20 kitchen cabinet organizer.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make.
