(I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m writing that.)By Sarah JampelJanuary 14, 2022FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Emma Fishman, Food Styling by Susan Ottaviano\u00a0FacebookTwitterEmailWhen the fridge is bare\u2014like, butt-naked\u2014and the pantry is also slim-pickins (who put back that empty box of cereal\u2026), I find solace in knowing there\u2019s always pancakes. But Sarah, you\u2019re asking yourself, what about eggs and butter and buttermilk? And to that I answer: As long as I have a couple of bananas (and really, I only need one) and some rolled oats, I can make a short stack, no eggs or dairy required.These pancakes are bound, thickened, and sweetened (signed, sealed, and delivered) with two main ingredients: rolled oats and banana. The oats are blitzed up in the food processor so that they break down into starchy, sawdusty particles that can then unite the rest of the roster: a banana (for sugar and moisture), baking powder (lightness, lift), olive oil (savory suppleness), plant-based milk (or dairy milk, even), ground cinnamon, and salt. Pur\u00e9e it all together, then stir in more rolled oats (for additional texture) and optional-but-not-really chocolate chips. Let the batter rest to thicken up, and that\u2019s it\u2014you\u2019re ready to heat up the stove. Plop a few thin slices of banana onto each pancake before you flip and they\u2019ll soften and caramelize when they hit the hot skillet.The pancake recipe is simple, but in my testing\u2014and retesting\u2014I\u2019ve learned how to make them as great as possible:1. Let your batter rest.\u00a0The ground oats need a bit of time to absorb the liquid and, in turn, to thicken the batter. I\u2019ve found 15 minutes to be the sweet spot. Don\u2019t skip it.2. Get the pan hot before you add the batter.\u00a0When you add pancake batter to a hot pan, rather than a lukewarm one, it sets immediately, thereby preventing your batter blob from spreading out too thin. I recommend adding the batter to a hot pan\u2014it should sizzle!\u2014and then lowering the heat so that the pancake can cook through without burning. And remember: The first pancake is always the worst, so consider your premier to be a tester.3. Use the \u201coptional\u201d chocolate chips.The batter, with no added sugar and a savoriness from the olive oil, isn\u2019t sweet. So throw in a generous amount of chocolate chips (make sure they\u2019re dairy-free if these pancakes are intended to be vegan) and douse your serving in maple syrup.4. Double the recipe.\u00a0This recipe makes 6\u20137 pancakes, enough for two fairly hungry people. But I recommend doubling it and storing any extras in the fridge. Reheat them in a toaster (or toaster oven), or just eat them cold in between meals (that\u2019s what I do).5. Make the batter your own.\u00a0There\u2019s flexibility here. Use any milk (plant-based or otherwise) you have on hand; swap in canola oil for the olive oil if you prefer a neutral flavor; switch up the ground cinnamon (ground cardamom and ginger would also be good); and play with the mix-ins: While I can\u2019t, in good faith, suggest leaving out the chocolate chips, you could use chopped walnuts or shredded coconut in place of the additional rolled oats.Admittedly, these are never going to be ultra-buttery, indulgent fluffsters. They\u2019re not diner pancakes\u2014they\u2019re dense and wholesome yet utterly satisfying. And the best part? You really can make them on a weekday\u2014just hop in the shower (or back in bed) while the batter rests. Once you (and the batter) are feeling refreshed, make yourself a tiny stack of pancakes and be glad you didn\u2019t have to crack any eggs to get here.Now have some pancakes!Vegan Banana-Oat PancakesLike banana bread in pancake form, these pancakes have crisp edges and tender centers with big banana flavor.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPancakeRecipes you want to make.
