This week we talked to Bertha Gonz\u00e1lez Nieves, co-founder and CEO of Casa Dragones and the first female Maestra Tequilera.For most of my life, I\u2019ve preferred to drink spirits only when diluted with, say, a lot of fresh lime juice, a dash of agave, and an extra salty glass. I\u2019d never imagined sipping tequila (and certainly not *enjoying* it) until I met Bertha Gonz\u00e1lez Nieves. Gonz\u00e1lez Nieves is the CEO of Casa Dragones, a Mexican brand she co-founded with MTV-founder Bob Pittman in 2008. Their two high-end tequilas\u2014Casa Dragones Joven, a perfectly clear master blend of silver and extra-aged tequila; and Casa Dragones Blanco, a crisp, young silver tequila\u2014are produced from an agave varietal called Tequilana Weber, hand-harvested in the northwestern state of Jalisco.\u201cI just fell in love with the transformation of this extraordinary plant into a juice that people adore,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez Nieves tells me, pouring us each a glass of Joven from behind the enviable bar in her New York headquarters. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most well-known things about Mexico and such an important part of our social fabric; we celebrate with tequila, we cry with tequila.\u201dMaybe it was Gonz\u00e1lez Nieves\u2019 genuine passion for the product\u2014before starting her business, she spent 10 years working for tequila giant Grupo Cuervo\u2014or maybe it was the $275 price-point. But after a swig of the Joven, I found myself saying things like: \u201cIt smells subtly of grapefruit,\u201d and \u201cMmmm, I really do taste notes of smooth vanilla!\u201d The Blanco ($75 a bottle) was less complex but more refreshing and herbaceous, like a green apple dusted with black pepper. Neither followed with any of the infamous back-of-the-throat sting you might associate with the tequila you drank in college.Gonz\u00e1lez Nieves\u2019s mission is to showcase an increasingly sophisticated Mexico, so it makes sense that world-class restaurants like Rosetta and Pujol in Mexico City and Cosme and The Nomad in New York stock her spirits.We chatted with Gonz\u00e1lez Nieves about the ups and downs of entrepreneurship, the value of partnership, and her love of a good airport egg-scramble.Why did you decide to go out on your own after working at Jose Cuervo?I worked for the Beckmann family for 10 years. It\u2019s an 11th generation family business, and an example of a truly extraordinary Mexican company. But I realized that it was never going to be my company. I come from a family of entrepreneurs, and I was getting the itch to build something.Have you always considered yourself entrepreneurial?Definitely! After leaving Cuervo, I invested in a [now defunct] magazine that was a hybrid of New York Magazine and TimeOut in Mexico City, which was incredible. After that, I co-produced a film in Mexico, called Matando Cabos, which was an official selection at the Sundance Film Festival in 2005. But I realized I was jumping into other people's projects and that I should do my own thing. And my passion is tequila.How did that little seed of desire develop into a business?[Laughs.] Well, I meet Bob Pittman\u2014the founder of MTV and my business partner\u2014at a party in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Our conversation somehow led to, \u201cLet\u2019s start a tequila company together.\u201d And I'm like, \u201cIs this booze talk or is this for real?\u201d We exchanged cards and the next day I get a message from his secretary saying, \u201cWould you like to meet on this day at this time?\u201dWould it have been possible for you to start this business without partnering, financially, with someone like Pittman?No way. I had a couple of pesos lying around here and there, but no more than that. But when an individual decides to invest in you, it's a whole other level to VC funding. Because when they sign a check for your company, they're signing a check from their personal savings. So it just changes the meaning of money forever. Like, I am the boss, but I am also cleaning our offices right now. It\u2019s a rollercoaster for sure.What do you feel is the emotional return on having a co-founder?It\u2019s like when you're in the gym, and you're in that tenth repetition, and you need to do the 11th and someone just literally holds the bar. They're not doing the work for you, but they're really helping you; they\u2019re taking the weight off. I have this relationship with Bob\u2014there are truly times that he believes in me more than I really do myself. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to pick yourself up. No one talks about it, but it is tough.Can you explain what those founding years were like?I think that those first two years will forever be some of the best of my life. Because we were just trying to produce the best possible product. We didn't have to do anything else but focus on that, and it really set the foundation of our company around quality and excellence.Speaking of excellence, you are the first ever Maestra Tequilera (female master distiller of tequila). Can you explain what that means?A Maestra Tequilera (or Maestro Tequilero) is the person within a production house that is in charge of manufacturing the product and defining the unique formula. I became one after 12 years in the industry. Before I even applied to become certified, I called the [governing body] and asked them, \u201cIf I do this, will you take me seriously?\u201d \u201cYes, sure,\u201d they said. [Laughs.]Why are you the first woman to receive this recognition?It's definitely a male dominated industry. So, when I got my title, I told my mentors that I almost had to grow a mustache for them to accept me, and they were all laughing. But it's true. I mean, when I came into this industry that I loved so much, I looked around, and I was like, \u201cOh, there are no women here.\u201dThroughout your journey building Casa Dragones, what has been the most challenging factor?The hardest thing is really persistence and endurance, and finding that passion within to drive you. When you\u2019re building a business, your previous challenge is forgotten so quickly, because you're in front of a new one already. So, there's no time really to relish in the victories.Do you think this ability to thrive in an entrepreneurial environment is more dependent on endurance or passion?I think passion is like a magic potion for endurance. Everybody has the same level of endurance, but if you have the passion, then endurance will be multiplied by one hundred.Does naivety place a role in this formula at all?It\u2019s a superpower. If I knew what I\u2019d be encountering in the future, I don't think I could do it.From chilling in Bob Pittman\u2019s office with a Blackberry on day one to now, how has the way you spend your time changed?The only thing that I know about my time is that there is never enough! The only constant is change and you have to deal with the cards you\u2019re dealt on a constant basis. I mean, I was in Chicago yesterday, now I'm here, and on Monday I'm going to be in Atlanta. At the start, it was all about the product, and now I spend a lot of time working with my team to figure things out strategically.With all that travel, do you find time to stay active?Staying within your routine of a daily life when you're traveling is practically impossible. One of my personal goals is to try and fit more exercise in while I\u2019m away. It just makes me a better person. But in general, I\u2019m into adrenaline. I like Soul Cycle and stuff like that.What about food? How do you eat well on the go?I try to have raw almonds always, in case I'm really hungry. And, in airports, which are full of junk food, you can always get scrambled eggs. I love scrambled eggs with turkey and tomato or whatever. Even if it's 3 p.m., I'll have eggs, and it'll be better than anything else I'm going to eat in there.Explore Bon App\u00e9titEntrepreneurs Run the WorldHealthyishTequilaMexicanAlcohol & Other DrinksInterviewsRead MoreLifestyleHow Alison Cayne Handles a Cooking School, a Caf\u00e9, a Sauce Business, and Five KidsBy Ali FrancisRecipes you want to make.
