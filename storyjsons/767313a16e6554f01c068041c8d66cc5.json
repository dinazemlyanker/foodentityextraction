It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Broc-bolo yoloFinally made Rapo\u2019s Broccoli Bolognese, shortened to \u201cbroc-bolo\u201d around the office because talking is hard. It was fantastic! Some readers hate that we called this \u201cbolognese\u201d because it\u2019s not bolognese at all, but I don\u2019t take things like \u201cwords\u201d and \u201cmeanings\u201d so literally. It\u2019s a catchy name, you see what you get, it tastes good, and it comes together fast. And it\u2019s pretty variable, if you consider yourself a visionary. I used bacon in place of sausage.So make it, why doncha: Broccoli Bolognese with OrecchietteWant this letter before it hits the website?

I like to dilute it on ice with seltzer, swap lemon for lime, and spike it with a flu shot.Brew it: Lemon-Ginger BrewButt-ernutMother Nature\u2019s gifts are vast and varied, but one showed up in the Test Kitchen this week that was cracked and scary. A butternut squash that lived up to its name. \u201cSend me your photos of the butt-ernut,\u201d I asked the staff. What I received will haunt me for the rest of my days.Hi momDo you watch Healthyish\u2019s weekly Instagram series, \u201c30 Seconds with Andy\u201d? If you\u2019re interested in the skincare tips, bulging bicep secrets, and other self-improvement musings from Andy Baraghani, tune in! I know one person who never misses an episode, and that\u2019s Andy\u2019s mom, who DMs the Healthyish Instagram account with her supportive feedback. The love here is meant for Andy, but it\u2019s received by all, especially our social media editors who could use a break from the snippy messages about why we\u2019re not wearing hairnets (this isn\u2019t Luby\u2019s!). Some of Mama B\u2019s words of encouragement: \u201cU look amazing\u201d, \u201cRight on my love\u201d, \u201cthis recipe is so good, can\u2019t wait to make it\u201d, and my favorite, \u201cWhy not serum first\u201d. \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95Photo by Stephen Kent Johnson, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiSpeaking of AndyI made his tried-and-terrific lamb meatballs this weekend, and they still bang.Get the recipe: Lamb Meatballs with Raisin PestoPhoto by Alex LauSnack-ishThe best desk snack is a near 2-pound tub of Goldfish and I won\u2019t take any other answers seriously!Read it: All the Snacks Bon App\u00e9tit Staffers Stash at Their DesksShould I talk aboutThe whiskey Tide pods? You know I hate giving into to trending stories manufactured by marketers in a sterile conference room, but if I have to, I have to. Glenlivet partnered with a swank London restaurant to make limited-edition cocktail \u201ccapsules\u201d with a dissolvable seaweed wrapper that looks like a you-know-what. *Whispers Tide Pod* *Whispers Deathhhhh.* *Whispers condom full of Scotch.* Honestly? I\u2019d try it. Moving along.Courtesy of Williams SonomaStar Wars x Le CreusetAfter I read this article about super fandom, I thought about the new Star Wars Le Creuset collection, which targets two intense fan communities. What a genius, moneymaking collaboration. Yes, people love those $300 pots. We used to write about every time Le Creuset announced a new color and the traffic to those stories was bonkers. People would be like, PURPLE POTS? YASSSS. LOVE PURPLE. FAVORITE COLOR. LOVE POTS. COOK IN \u2018EM. Now imagine that level of freak-out for moody Darth Vader Dutch ovens. Fans are fah-reaking. I\u2019m wondering: do they ever even cook, let alone eat, in Star Wars movies? I don\u2019t recall Luke braising rabbit in his little seaside hut, slapping out a loaf of sourdough. The cantina scene is a bar\u2014doesn\u2019t count. (Cue a million emails to me about food scenes.) Are these pots laced with some kind of \u201cforce\u201d like a scientifically improved cast iron? In the fan article from the New Yorker, Michael Schulman writes about the power fans have to control, reject, and influence plotlines of the shows/books they adore, and what a dangerous power that is to yield. I\u2019m probably reading too much into that when it comes to pot-lines. No matter what, I know I\u2019m going to have to get my brother a Millennium Falcon trivet.Unnecessary lifestyle meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekWe go through a lot of Parmesan cheese around these parts. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s how I was raised, but I default use the wide shreds of the box grater for all cheeses. But it turns out, I am wrong. That\u2019s \u201ccoarsely grated,\u201d not \u201cfinely grated.\u201d Nearly everyone at Bon App\u00e9tit microplanes their parm into fluffy, salty snowflakes. \u201cWe\u2019ve microplaned for many, ever years. The past,\u201d said Carla Lalli Music, as incoherently as I wrote it. Alex Delany uses the star-shaped side of the box grater, which I thought was only intended for ruining the sweaters of your enemies. \u201cFood processor for quantity,\u201d said Sohla El-Waylly, \u201cmicroplane for quality.\u201d Andy took a deep breath and spilled: \u201cWhat are my top three ways to shred parm? It\u2019s a firm cheese, there are SO many ways! The microplane or food processor for the consistency of shaker parm. Sometimes I shave it with vegetable peeler for pasta, or shave on a mandoline. Or the wide flap of box grater. Sometimes, I take a paring knife and twist it onto cheese for irregular little pieces, good if you want to drizzle oil and pepper on it for a snack, or nuggets for salad.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s gone fully rogue!\u201d exclaimed Christina Chaey (microplane). \u201cFOOD PRO ALL THE WAY HOME,\u201d said Molly Baz. \u201cIt\u2019s the optimal texture and yet it still melts into pasta sauces, and it\u2019s perfect for cae sal, so it\u2019s perfect for me.\u201d Side note: You can just buy it pre-grated at the cheese counter, per Carla, but only if it\u2019s at the cheese counter. Everything else \u201csmells like dead fishes\u201d and might contain wood chips.
