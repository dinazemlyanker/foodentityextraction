He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.When Molly Baz was developing Basically\u2019s Strawberry Shortcakes recipe, I never made it to the syrupy fruit or dollop of whipped cream.I wandered into the Test Kitchen one day around 3 p.m. in a slightly snacky, salty mood. But because it was Coffee O\u2019clock, I also felt like something a smidge sweet. And there on the counter sat a tray of freshly baked, golden brown shortcakes.Bingo.I broke off a corner. And then another corner. Buttery, flaky, salty, slightly sweet\u2014I couldn\u2019t stop. I lifted off the entire roof of the layered biscuit (I mean, we can just call it a biscuit, right?). Then, having gone that far, I gobbled up the bottom half. My afternoon espresso had never met such a fitting partner.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!When you watch the recipe on Basically (filmed in the site\u2019s signature step-by-step videos), you\u2019ll notice that in addition to the standard flour-butter-salt-sugar mixture, Molly incorporates both sour cream and heavy cream. I texted her yesterday to find out why. Here\u2019s what she said:\u201cSo the sour cream is the fat and the acid in the shortcake, which is basically a biscuit [See! I told you!], and it activates the baking soda. Essentially replaces the need for buttermilk with something even fattier to provide more moistness to the shortcake. And the heavy cream helps by thinning the sour cream to a drizzleable consistency. I chose to use those two instead of buttermilk because they also play double duty in the whipped cream portion of the recipe. You whip the remaining heavy cream to soft peaks and then stir in a bit more sour cream, which creates a tangier whipped cream. (As always, with the 10-ingredient cap on Basically recipes, ya gotta get smart with your ingredients.)\u201dMolly\u2019s off-the-cuff text revealed why Basically recipes are often my favorites\u2014and why they typically drive chart-topping traffic for bonappetit.com.Because of the vertical\u2019s learn-to-cook ethos, no recipe can require more than 10 ingredients, and the ingredients themselves need to be accessible (no running to three specialty stores in order to cook dinner). Nor can the recipes be that time consuming.The upshot is that our recipe developers are forced to get industrious and resourceful. Turns out the more constraints we apply, the more creative they get.So, in this case, you wind up with a biscuit (excuse me, shortcake) that works as well with in-season macerated strawberries as ripe peaches or blueberries.Oh, and macerated? That just means you hit the fruit with a sprinkle of sugar and a shot of lemon juice \u2018til it gets all glazed and gorgeous. Sounds fancy but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s just Basically.Get the recipe:Basically Strawberry ShortcakesYou can make this classic summertime dessert with whatever seasonal berries are calling your name.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterStrawberryDessertRead MorecookingA Strawberry Dessert for People Who Can\u2019t BakeBy Carla Lalli MusiccookingBet You Can\u2019t Eat Just One Slice of This Strawberry Snacking CakeBy Sarah JampelshoppingSilicone Mats Are So Nonstick, You\u2019d Think They Were Crafted By AngelsBy Sarah JampelcookingGet Lost In the Swirls of This Strawberry-Coconut Ice Cream PieBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
