This is the creamy, salty, tangy flavor combo that dreams are made of.Ingredients8 servingsCrust2Tbsp. poppy seeds2Tbsp. white and/or black sesame seeds4tsp. dried garlic flakes4tsp. dried onion flakes1\u00bdtsp. kosher salt1tsp. sugar2cups all-purpose flour, plus more for surface\u00bdcup (1 stick) chilled unsalted butter, cut into piecesFilling and Assembly6large eggs\u00becup heavy cream\u00becup sour cream2tsp. kosher salt\u00betsp. freshly ground black pepper6scallions, thinly sliced\u00bdsmall red onion, thinly sliced1\u00bdsprigs dill, chopped1Tbsp. chopped drained capers1Tbsp. fresh lemon juiceFlaky sea salt8oz. smoked salmon, thinly sliced (optional)Lemon wedges (for serving)Special EquipmentA 9\"-diameter deep pie dishPreparationCrustStep 1Pulse poppy seeds, sesame seeds, garlic flakes, onion flakes, kosher salt, sugar, and 2 cups flour in a food processor a few times to combine. Add butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal with some pieces of butter still visible. With the motor running, drizzle in 7 Tbsp. ice water and continue to pulse, adding another tablespoonful of water if needed, until dough is still crumbly but just holds together when squeezed.Step 2Turn out dough onto a clean surface and knead a couple of times, pressing to incorporate any shaggy pieces. Press into a 6\"-diameter disk and smooth out any cracks around the perimeter. Wrap tightly in plastic and chill at least 1 hour.Step 3If chilling more than 1 hour, let dough sit at room temperature 5\u201310 minutes to soften slightly. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to a 14\" round. Wrap dough around rolling pin and transfer to pie dish. Unfurl dough from around pin and lift up edges, letting dough slump down into dish. Gently press dough into corners, if needed. Trim, leaving about a 1\" overhang. Fold overhang under and crimp edges. Chill 30 minutes.Step 4Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0. Line dough with a double layer of foil, leaving some overhang. Fill with pie weights or dried beans. Press foil gently up sides of dough to help support weights (no foil should be touching the crimped edges). Bake crust until edges are dry and just beginning to brown, 25\u201330 minutes. Carefully remove foil and weights. Continue to bake until surface of crust looks dry and the center is just beginning to take on color, 15\u201320 minutes (you want the crust to stay fairly blond as it will continue to brown when you bake the filling). Transfer to a wire rack and let cool.Step 5Do Ahead: Dough can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled, or freeze up to 2 months.Filling and AssemblyStep 6Preheat oven to 300\u00b0. Vigorously whisk eggs, heavy cream, sour cream, kosher salt, and pepper in a large bowl to combine. Add scallions and whisk again just to incorporate.Step 7Place pie dish on a rimmed baking sheet. Pour egg mixture into crust. Bake quiche until filling is just set (it will still jiggle a little in the center) and slightly puffed around the edges and crust is golden brown, 80\u201390 minutes. Transfer quiche to a wire rack and let cool.Step 8Place onion in a fine-mesh sieve and rinse under cold running water. Pat dry with paper towels and place in a medium bowl. Add dill, capers, and lemon juice and toss to combine.Step 9Top quiche with onion mixture and sprinkle with sea salt. Serve with smoked salmon (if using) and lemon wedges.Step 10Do Ahead: Quiche (without toppings) can be baked 1 day ahead. Wrap with plastic or foil and chill. Let come to room temperature before serving.Step 11Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesHow would you rate Fully Loaded Everything Bagel Quiche?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (9)Back to TopTriangleDid anyone use a premade pie crust?Kathy CooperSandia Park New Mexico8/1/2021This is quite an expensive quite an expensive Quiche to make for those without those things in the cupboard or refrig. Why not do a simple onion Swiss cheese Quich\u00e9 and serve with an Everything Bagel and cream cheese.DavidDuluth MN3/19/2021It was kinda worth it. I felt like the end result was tasty, but I'm not sure if it was worth so many hours of prep? It felt like there were so many steps that were unnecessary and could have been simpler. For example, after putting the pastry in the pie dish, you're supposed to refrigerate for 30 min. I just put it in the freezer for 5, and that was plenty to help it keep its shape. And the crust was definitely too thick; I agree with other reviewers that a smaller batch rolled thinner would have been easier to cut through. Although if you're going to go to all the work of making the dough, might as well make two quiches and keep one in the freezer or give it away. \n\nI did feel like the filling was light and fluffy. I only used 1/3 cup sour cream instead of the 3/4 that are called for, but that didn't seem to have a negative impact. I also used sea salt instead of kosher salt. Similarly to another reviewer, I used Trader Joes bagel seasoning and just supplemented with extra poppyseeds and sesame seeds. I ended up adding some crispy bacon to the top of the quiche after I'd baked it for about 20 minutes, and that did nicely. Also, I only ended up baking mine for 50 minutes, not 90(!) because it was already fully cooked at 50, and would have been burnt to a crisp! I feel like if you followed the directions to the letter you'd end up spending way more time than was necessary on this recipe and end up with a burnt, dry quiche.\n\nSo overall it was a hit - tasty crust, light fluffy filling. Was it worth the several hours of labor I spent on it? Not sure - it ended up stretching into two days, so if I ever chose to make it again, I'd make two of them and make & bake the crust a day ahead of time. It's definitely not a \"spontaneous same day brunch\" dish. I'd give it 5 stars for taste, but I have to knock it down to 3 because the recipe is overcomplicated for what this actually is. I feel like it could be much simpler and end up with the same result.Anonymous2/1/2021This was generally good, but HOLY CRAP was it salty! I actually only put 1 tsp of kosher salt (I use diamond kosher as everyone is recommending these days) because 2 seemed a bit much, but it was still a pretty intensely salty experience. Full disclosure, I threw the salmon and capers (plus some red onion) into the custard mix and baked it because it seemed like I may as well just eat a sandwich if I was going to just pile most of the ingredients on top. I served it with tomato, dill, and arugula, which offset the salt a bit when you had a bite with all of it together. It really did taste like a fully loaded lox sandwich! I will also add the caveat that the crust makes enough for two quiches\u2014it was almost half an inch thick in a standard 9in pie plate. Next time I\u2019ll cut both the crust recipe and the salt by half! AnonymousDetroit, MI 11/18/2020Crust is genius. Can\u2019t believe this wasn\u2019t thought of sooner. I used Trader Joe\u2019s everything bagel seasoning blend. Next time I might try putting the capers, onion, dill and salmon in the quiche before baking. AnonymousSeattle5/25/2020Absolutely delicious! Anonymous5/18/2020OMG, This is THE BEST QUICHE I'VE EVER MADE!!! The Salmon was especially Delicious!!!!! The Everything Bagel Crust was FANTASTIC!!!!!! I am finding it VERY DIFFICULT to choose between this one and the other I reviewed! I always follow your recipe Perfectly and it ALWAYS turns out GREAT!!!!AnonymousEast China, MI10/1/2019This dish turned out so well.  The quiche was so creamy and the crust, delicious!\n\nThe only adjustments I would make in the future are rolling my dough out to be a little thinner. The 14\" diameter that it was rolled out was still a little thick and made cutting the quiche difficult. I also would scale back on the amount of dill we purchased. In the end we only used 2 tbsp roughly chopped. efhines5752Los Angeles3/5/2019Can you make the crust the day before? The recipe notes you can make the dough before, but what about actually baking the crust before?AnonymousTennessee2/28/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titSavory Pie & TartQuicheEggSalmonFishSeafoodMainVegetarianBreakfastLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
