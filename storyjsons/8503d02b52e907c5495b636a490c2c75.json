Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,Maybe you\u2019re staring down the last few hours at the office; maybe you\u2019re already in the vacation zone. Or maybe you\u2019re like me, stuck in traffic, desperately trying to get there.Wherever you are, I thought you might want some last-minute recipe ideas for the holiday weekend. I\u2019m not in charge of the cooking where I\u2019m going, but if I were, you can bet I\u2019d be grilling this salmon with whole lemon, some swordfish steaks with heirloom tomatoes, or a couple pounds of shrimp with spicy turmeric-citrus sauce.But the best summer party foods, in my opinion, are the sides. This potato-meets-egg salad with mustard vinaigrette is my never-fail potluck offering and I love the sweetness that dates lend to this celery-cucumber-arugula salad. I\u2019m convinced the best way to eat green beans is with miso, based on this bean salad with miso dressing and these summer beans with miso butter. I nearly squealed when I remembered this roasted pepper caprese from last year\u2019s Farmers\u2019 Market Challenge: I love it so much.Green beans and cucumbers with miso dressing\nAlex LauIf there\u2019s space on the grill (or you don\u2019t mind turning on the stove), either of these two summer squash recipes will make you very happy: marinated with lemony ricotta or grilled with red onions and feta. And I\u2019d be doing a disservice if I didn\u2019t mention BA contributor Deb Perelman\u2019s charred eggplant and walnut pesto pasta salad. I make it every summer, and every summer I remember that it\u2019s the only pasta salad for me.I know everyone wants a summer-fruit-centric dessert, in which case: strawberry shortcake! But I\u2019m more interested in something icy-cold, like a frozen Greek yogurt pie or a lemon-sesame semifreddo (use the optional CBD for some extra family-friendly chill). Want more? Here are 28 other summer-friendly dessert ideas.Whatever\u2019s on your reusable plates, I hope you get the peace and quiet\u2014or the fun and party\u2014you\u2019re looking for over this long weekend. I\u2019m aiming for all of the above.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish EditorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishFourth Of JulyRead Morecooking55 Healthy Grilling Recipes to Make This SummerGallery65 SlidesBy Ali FrancisRecipes you want to make.
