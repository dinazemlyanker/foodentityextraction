When simmered in butter and miso, delicate hakurei turnips turn tender and sweet, providing a perfect contrast to their peppery greens. Building on Hall\u2019s Smoked Paprika and Sun-Dried Tomato Potlikker, this brothy pasta is hearty and warming without being too heavy. Making the Smoked Paprika and Sun-Dried Tomato Potlikker is a crucial first step here, so be sure to read through that recipe first.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

The process of making all the parts was fun but once it came together, the miso butter turnips overpowered the dish in a bizarre and sweet flavor that overpowered the whole meal. It looked gorgeous plated though. Jenna C. Los Angels, CA3/10/2022Made the potlikker first thing in the morning so that the flavors could come together a bit.  The entire house smelled amazing!  Dinner came together super quickly after that.  Husband kept naming other ways we could use the potlikker and son didn't say a word as he gobbled it all up.  We love turnips and the only small ones I could find were purple, but they worked well.  I would think any large turnip would also work, if cut to smaller pieces.  Only wish was that I had also gotten a good loaf of crusty bread to soak up the extra sauce.  Leftovers were great the next day as well.  We'll be making this again!LBinTXTexas2/22/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titDinnerVegetarianNut-FreePastaTurnipVegetableSouthernAmericanSoul FoodMisoCondiments, Sauces & PastesMainRecipes you want to make.
