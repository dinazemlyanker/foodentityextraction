When whisked vigorously, the proteins in egg whites denature and form new bonds, creating a tight network where air is trapped. These bubbles bring lift and lightness to mousses, sponge cakes, and meringues.\u00a0But it\u2019s not all fancy desserts: Whipped whites offer height to pancakes and waffles and can turn a regular omelet into an omelet souffl\u00e9. To whip whites successfully, follow these tips.1. Get set for successStart with room-temp eggs (cold whites don't incorporate air nearly as well) and a totally clean large bowl\u2014 even a drop of fat will interfere. Some people add a pinch of cream of tartar before they start, which prevents over-whipping and helps the whites reach a greater volume.2. Start slowStart at low speed in order to break up the proteins in the egg whites, which will allow them to become more elastic. Once they're loose (you'll notice that they're more foamy\u2014see below\u2014and homogenous-looking), begin beating more quickly to incorporate air.3. Know the stagesWhen you start beating, your whites will look foamy, like sudsy soap. Next, they\u2019ll reach soft peaks, where they briefly hold their shape before sinking into the bowl. Keep beating (this is when a recipe for sweetened egg whites might have you slowly add sugar) and you\u2019ll get to medium peaks, which keep their shape but bend at the top like a witch\u2019s hat or, as the French call it, bec d\u2019oiseau (bird\u2019s beak). Finally, you\u2019ll reach stiff peaks, which stand tall and straight. At this point, your mixture will be fluffy and voluminous, like marshmallow fluff or shaving cream.4. Stop at stiffDon\u2019t be tempted to continue: Go too far and the meringue will start to weep (a.k.a. release water) and form clumps that can't be easily incorporated into a batter. To fix broken, over-beaten egg whites, you can add an additional white and whisk briefly, just to incorporate its moisture into the original group. But don't take it too far or you'll be back where you started.Whip egg whites, eat like an angel:BA's Best Angel Food CakeAngel food cake is so simple, but the specific ingredients and equipment matter.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titEggEgg WhitesRecipes you want to make.
