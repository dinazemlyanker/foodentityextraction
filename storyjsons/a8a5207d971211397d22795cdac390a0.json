When soaked in hot water and blended at high speed, cashews lend their fattiness to make luxurious, creamy sauces that\u2014thanks to the nut\u2019s neutral flavor\u2014blend into the background in the best way possible. Here that cashew cream is married with tomato (a combination of whole canned tomatoes and paste) for a fruity, tangy sauce reminiscent of pasta alla vodka. Just as in the original, the alcohol brightens the rich dish and enhances the tomatoes\u2019 fruitiness.The key to making the smoothest sauce possible is to blend the soaked cashews with water on their own before adding the tomato mixture. While it is possible to make this sauce in a food processor, a high-powered blender is going to give you the glossiest, least-grainy sauce.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Pour boiling water over to cover and let soak 30 minutes. (If you set the cashews aside and then prep and measure all of the remaining ingredients, they should be ready to go right on time!)Step 2Heat \u00bc cup extra-virgin olive oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium heat. Add 1 large onion, thinly sliced, and 5 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped, season with kosher salt, and cook, stirring often, until softened and onion is translucent, 5\u20137 minutes. Add \u00bd tsp. crushed red pepper flakes and cook, stirring to release flavor, 30 seconds. Add one 4.5-oz. tube or \u00bd cup double-concentrated or regular tomato paste and cook, stirring often and reducing heat if needed, until it starts to stick to bottom of pot but is still bright red in color, 3\u20134 minutes. Add one 14.5-oz. can whole peeled tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally and crushing tomatoes with spoon, until thickened slightly and starting to stick to bottom of pot, about 5 minutes.Step 3When tomato sauce is nearly done, cook 1 lb. short, chunky pasta (such as rigatoni, conchiglie, or casarecce) in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain pasta, reserving 1\u00bd cups pasta cooking liquid.Step 4Drain cashews and return to blender. Add 1 cup fresh water and blend on high until smooth and creamy (you can\u2019t overblend, so really go for it!). Add tomato sauce and \u00bd tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bc tsp. Morton kosher salt and blend until smooth. Return sauce to pot and set over low heat to keep warm.Step 5When pasta is about 2 minutes from being done, stir \u00bc cup vodka into sauce. Increase heat to medium-low and bring to a simmer; cook off alcohol, about 1 minute.Step 6Transfer pasta to sauce (it\u2019s okay if some water clings to the noodles) and add \u00bd cup reserved pasta cooking liquid. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring and adding more pasta cooking liquid \u00bc cup at a time as needed, until pasta is coated in sauce, about 2 minutes; season with salt. (Note: This pasta stiffens as it sits. To refresh the pot for a second\u2014or third\u2014helping, stir in more reserved pasta cooking liquid to loosen.)Step 7Divide pasta among bowls and top with torn basil leaves and vegan Parmesan (if using). Season with freshly ground black pepper and drizzle more oil over. Serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over.How would you rate Vegan Pasta alla Vodka (Sorta)?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleDelicious and very creamy! cashew cream is the best!!AnonymousLos Angeles 3/24/2022But but but not am 73 and still not vegan or gluten free.
