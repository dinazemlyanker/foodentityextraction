We brought the necessities for outdoor life: bug spray, hamburger patties, and too much just enough beer. After bagels and a meandering \u201chike\u201d, it came time to turn on the grill. This was the moment when I realized we were woefully underprepared.There were no sides. No kimchi slaw, no charred bean and pea salad. We didn\u2019t even have an obligatory mayo-drenched pasta salad! Conveniently, I did have Bon Appetit\u2019s summer grilling issue. Probably because I work there. I searched for a recipe that could be made with an understocked pantry and landed on this grilled corn salad with hot-honey dressing from B\u2019s Cracklin\u2019 BBQ in Atlanta.All we needed was: corn, limes, herbs, and chiles. The cilantro at the local market looked sad, so I subbed in mint because it was the perkiest bundle of herbs I could find. Then, we booked it back to the rental kitchen.Ros\u00e9 sangria won\u2019t hurt with this herby salad.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Yekaterina BoytsovaThey say a good leader is marked by their ability to deligate, and man, did I boss my friends around. We shucked the corn, buttered them up, and grilled until the kernels were tender and charred in spots, about 10\u201312 minutes. Somewhere around this time, an eggplant materialized, and a grilled eggplant Caprese salad shortly followed. So did a pitcher of sangria. (Turns out that cache of beer went surprisingly fast.)While a friend manned the grill, I whisked together a dressing from lime juice, honey, Sriracha, granulated garlic, and salt. Once the corn was cool enough to handle, we cut the kernels off the cob and added them into the vinaigrette.Next came the herbs, chile, and avocado, which get tossed together until everything\u2019s coated. You know the rest of the drill: salt and pepper, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and chill. You\u2019re supposed to chill for at least two hours to let the dressing marinate, but I won\u2019t lie to you, we lasted about 45 minutes until digging in. I blame the sangria.At the risk of sounding too smug, I have to brag about how delicious this corn salad was with burgers. It was crunchy and fresh, with little bursts of sweetness from the corn kernels set over the top by that hot-honey dressing. The mint and lime cut through, providing some much-needed brightness, and I\u2019m sure that cilantro would have worked even better. We ate it outside, gazing at mountains and basking in the satisfaction of a meal well made. I like to think this salad would taste equally good indoors, in my dark apartment kitchen set to the soundtrack of city traffic, but I haven\u2019t tested this theory. I don\u2019t want to ruin that moment.Get the recipeGrilled Corn Salad with Hot Honey\u2013Lime DressingBright and light, this grilled corn salad with avocado will go with everything else at your summer barbecue.View RecipeAnother summer classic: Brad\u2019s campfire ribsExplore Bon App\u00e9titCornSummer SideshoneyRead MorecookingThis Spicy Kimchi Slaw Provides More Balance Than a Yoga ClassBy Emily SchultzRecipes you want to make.
