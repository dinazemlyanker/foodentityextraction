Associate food editor Rachel Gurjar loves using it to complement seared skirt steak, as well as chicken, eggplant, cauliflower, or any other ingredient that longs for massive flavor. Serve the steak with rice, roasted potatoes, or a salad for a full meal.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt in a food processor (a mini processor works well here) until a coarse paste forms. Transfer to a small heatproof bowl.Step 2Heat \u2153 cup oil in a small skillet over medium-high. Cook cumin until fragrant, about 10 seconds. Transfer to bowl with paste; add peanuts and mix well. Set scallion thecha aside for serving.Step 3Pat steaks dry with paper towels and season on both sides with kosher salt. Rub a little oil over steaks to coat lightly.Step 4Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Add half of the steak, arranging in a single layer, and cook, undisturbed, until a golden brown crust forms, 2\u20133 minutes. Turn steak over and cook until second side forms a golden brown crust, 2\u20133 minutes. (Steak should be thin enough that once it\u2019s seared it will be cooked to medium-rare\u2014about 125\u00b0 on an instant-read thermometer. If you have a very hot pan, this will happen quickly.) Transfer steak to a cutting board and repeat process with remaining steak. Let rest 10 minutes.Step 5Slice steak against the grain and arrange on a platter. Top with reserved scallion thecha and sprinkle with sea salt.How would you rate Skirt Steak With Scallion Thecha?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (4)Back to TopTriangleTHIS is what I've always wanted Chimichurri to be.  The oil infused with the cumin seeds is the secret ingredient for me.  I can't wait to put this Thecha on more things.  If you are allergic to peanuts, I don't think that they add much more than texture, so leave them out and don't miss out on the rest that this has to offer.Tom Scanlon3/26/2022Rachel, how lovely to put thecha on the global table. In Mumbai, I use it to marinade fresh mackerel, packed into slits along the sides and pan fried in coconut oil. Also great to dip fried prawns into...Leena Mumbai 3/19/2022Diamond crystal has half the sodium,so if using another brand of kosher sch as Morton than reduce by half; same goes for regular or sea salt.AnonymousPhx Arizona 3/19/2022Diamond crystal?Anonymous115663/19/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titDinnerMainEasyQuickWeeknight MealsGluten-FreeDairy-FreeSearSteakBeefMeatScallionOnionVegetableSerrano ChileChileCilantroHerbs & SpicesRecipes you want to make.
