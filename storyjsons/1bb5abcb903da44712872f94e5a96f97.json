There\u2019s so much to love about za\u2019atar! Bright, earthy, herby, and toasty, it makes plain stuff (boiled eggs, garlicky yogurt, canned chickpeas) taste exciting and exciting stuff (roast chicken, green sauce, homemade hummus) taste special. Let\u2019s just say that if I were in a life or death situation where I had to pick a favorite spice mix, za\u2019atar would be it.*What it is:Za'atar is so multifaceted and dynamic because it's a blend of so many different flavors, textures, and fragrances. Even though it varies greatly depending on where you are in the Middle East (specific recipes are sometimes closely-guarded secrets!), za'atar is generally a combination of dried oregano, thyme, and/or marjoram (woodsy and floral), with sumac (tangy and acidic) and toasted sesame seeds (nutty and rich). And, as if that weren't enough, za'atar sometimes contains salt, dried orange zest, dried dill, or the wild herb za'atar (also called hyssop, it grows throughout the Levant and is the mixture's namesake).How to eat it:Za\u2019atar encompasses such a wide range of flavors that it can be the bright note that both enlivens and anchors sliced tomatoes, the unifying force in a salad of refreshing smashed cucumbers and salty, fatty feta, and the replacement for lemon and herbs on a roast chicken. Consider adding it when you're looking for a spice mix that's earthy, savory, and tangy, all in one. In the Middle East, za'atar is often eaten with oil-dipped bread or labneh, or spread onto flatbread dough before it\u2019s baked into man\u2019oushe.If you\u2019re cooking with za\u2019atar, you don\u2019t need any other spices\u2014it can hold its own. But I\u2019m not going to stop you from pairing it with garlic, fresh tender herbs, lemon, toasted nuts, and chile flakes.And if you\u2019re not going to be heating up za'atar in the cooking process, you can bring out the most flavor by blooming it in hot oil or butter. Heat the fat in a small skillet, take it off the heat, and add the za'atar\u2014then drizzle over popcorn or toast.How to buy it:Za'atar is made with a wide range of ingredients in varying proportions. Senior food editor Andy Baraghani recommends seeking out za'atar that\u2019s extremely fragrant, very green (a sign that the dried herbs are new and potent), and not clumpy. While Andy prefers za'atar that\u2019s heavy on thyme and sesame, with seeds that are slightly crushed, you should explore the ratio that tastes best to you. If you can find locally-made za\u2019atar, that\u2019s even better, since it\u2019s likely to be fresher. Andy recommends NY Shuk\u2019s za\u2019atar, which is made with traditional za\u2019atar leaves, as well as roasted chickpeas for any even nuttier flavor.No matter what kind you track down, za\u2019atar is like any spice and will lose flavor over time. Buy it in small batches that you\u2019ll use up before your stash goes stale (you\u2019ll know it\u2019s no good when it no longer smells fragrant).How to make it yourself (kind of):If you can\u2019t find za\u2019atar at the store, experiment with making an approximation at home. Play around with different quantities of crushed dried oregano, dried thyme, and dried marjoram, and add sumac, toasted sesame seeds, and, if you want, salt.Sprinkle, eat, repeat.Now make a tomato salad:Fancy and Beautiful Tomato SaladHere\u2019s the first thing you should make when you want to show off the peak-season tomatoes you\u2019ve been waiting all year for.View Recipe*Oh, I also really like vadouvan. :)Explore Bon App\u00e9titZa'atarIngredientsSpiceRecipes you want to make.
