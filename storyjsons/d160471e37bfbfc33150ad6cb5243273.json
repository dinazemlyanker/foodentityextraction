Tandem Bakery Has the Cookie for YouBriana Holt's rye shortbread cookies are just the right amount of savory-sweet.By Sasha LevineDecember 21, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensFacebookTwitterEmailWe\u2019ve been flipping for Tandem Bakery ever since Andrew Knowlton crowned Portland, Maine, the restaurant city of the year in August. He loved the place so much, he recommended visiting every morning of your trip. There were too many things of baker Briana Holt\u2019s to try: biscuits with jam and butter, black pepper plum pies, chocolate-malt cakes, blue cheese and olive scones, brioche stuffed with kimchi, eggs, and cheddar... At this big-ticket confection counter, it would be easy to miss the unremarkable stack of brown, round coins about the size of your palm. But it would be a mistake if you did.\u201cIt took the rye shortbread cookie a long time to catch on,\u201d Holt says by phone, at home with a cup of Kava tea. \u201cI workshopped the recipe hard, as a personal quest to honor my favorite grain. I had to defend it to the death. But I believed in it wholeheartedly. People are sometimes unwilling to try something simple.\u201dOoooh, the display!\nPhoto by Peter Frank EdwardsHer patience paid off, and the unassuming cookie has its own cult following among bakers, locals, and pastry tourists\u2014those who swoon for its nutty, earthy flavor, nubbly texture, and understated richness. (I can vouch: I hadn\u2019t been at my post at Bon App\u00e9tit for one whole week before I started receiving requests to have the recipe tracked down.) It\u2019s the one people bring up the most when she\u2019s out in the wild, Holt says, where people whisper a compliment as if it were a secret handshake. \u201cTo me it\u2019s the kind of cookie where you don\u2019t know why you like it, but you just keep eating it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not the belle of the ball, but it\u2019s sooooo good.\u201dSo good, that we had to get the recipe. And just in time too. Sure the holidays are for colorful sugar and edible glitter, but we\u2019re all for throwing something a little unexpected, and lot less sweet, into the mix too.Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensHolt, who has a thing for savory pastries, developed the cookie around her love of rye and its nutty, tangy flavor. \u201cIt\u2019s a really old grain that\u2019s used a lot in Nordic and Eastern European cooking, which is a heavy combo of where my people are from,\u201d she says. Pairing the aromatic flour with lots and lots of butter felt like the right way to highlight its best attributes, so shortbread was the obvious answer. To top it off, she rolls the batter in black sesame seeds\u2014\u201cthey\u2019ve got this oily richness that adds an extra luxury,\u201d she says.While the bakery uses organic stone ground dark rye flour that\u2019s as freshly milled as she can get it, Holt assures any rye flour will do. They use coarse, stone ground rye flour.  \u201cIt allows the nutty flavor of the rye to really shine through while the texture of the cookie is more rustic,\u201d she says. \u201cFiner or more sifted rye will result in a cookie that has more \u2018snap\u2019 than \u2018crumble.\u2019 It\u2019s a subtle difference.\u201d Most important though, is the butter. She recommends any low moisture, high fat kind you can find (she likes Plugra 84 percent), which helps build both a decadent full-fat flavor and the overall structure of the cookie: Less moisture means more crispness. This is your excuse to spring for the $6 brick, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a time not to skimp!\u201dOn the left, baker-goddess Briana Holt.\nPeter Frank EdwardsBut what makes these cookies a true hero during holiday mayhem is that they improve with age. \u201cWe bake them the night before. They sit and dry out, and they\u2019re so much better in the morning,\u201d she says. \u201cShortbread is made to stick around. They\u2019re made to get better.\u201dIf their status as a cult classic wasn\u2019t reason enough to jump on the bandwagon wagon, that certainly is.Get the recipe:Rye Shortbread CookiesFor these shortbread cookies, the flavor deepens and the texture improves with time.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPortland MaineCookieholiday2018Recipes you want to make.
