Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m indecisive. Maybe it\u2019s because my eyes are bigger than my stomach. Or maybe it\u2019s because the abundance of options awakens a deep survivalist instinct, urging me to amass as many nutrients as possible. (Yeah no, probably not that last one.) Regardless, whatever table I\u2019m at is the one where the plates quickly pile up.So naturally, when associate visuals editor Emma Fishman and I pulled up to the bar at Adarra in Richmond, Virginia, we got not one, not two, but SIX gildas\u2014the iconic Spanish skewer of fat white anchovy, pickled guindilla pepper, and one briny green olive. (A word to the wise: each order comes with a glass of Emilio Hidalgo fino sherry.) And this was before Emma and I even got started on the rest of the menu. But I have no regrets.Wait, I actually do. We should have ordered a dozen more, because that\u2019s just how good chef Randall Doetzer\u2019s gildas are\u2014perfectly salty, buttery, lip-tinglingly sour, and just a tiny bit spicy, the kind that makes you want another.This perfection comes from tinkering with the three ingredients to strike the right balance of fat, acid, and salt. But because they\u2019re all either seasonal or available at the whim of an importer, Doetzer has to regularly search for new ones to swap onto the skewer. Sometimes it\u2019s a mild, fruity Castelvetrano olive, other times it\u2019s two Picholine from Morocco. On occasion it\u2019s a guindilla pepper from Basque country with a sharp, super acidic flavor; other times it\u2019s one that\u2019s a bit mellower. Since he first put the dish on the menu a couple months ago, he guesses he\u2019s gone through three different types of pepper, four kinds of olives, and two varieties of tinned anchovies.While constantly having to source new ingredients sounds like a logistical nightmare, it\u2019s all part of the fun for Doetzer. \u201cIt would be kind of boring if we had an indefinite supply of perfect olives\u2014it would never ever change,\u201d he explained. The only thing I\u2019m looking to change? The number of gildas I order next time I\u2019m there.Go there: AdarraExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsSpanishRichmondRead MorerestaurantsThe Wine Store in Barcelona Where Wine Nerds Just Want to Share the LoveBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
