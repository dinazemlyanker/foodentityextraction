While it might not have the over-the-top indulgence of the original, this approach is still plenty rich and delicious. Tomatoes add intensity and jammy sweetness, brightened by the pungency of that winter underdog, fresh horseradish. The generous snow-like dusting of tangy grated horseradish on top adds a sinus-clearing peppery zing to the dish. The knobby cream-colored root looks similar to a parsnip, and you can find it in the refrigerated section of well-stocked supermarkets\u2014though grated Parmesan would make a fine substitute. Serve the gratin as a side to a rich holiday meat like prime rib or simply on its own as a vegetarian main. \u2014Christian ReynosoAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Finely grate as much fresh horseradish over as you\u2019d like.How would you rate Potato-Tomato Gratin With Horseradish?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (3)Back to TopTriangleA little on the broth-y side, but nice, mild flavor (which may be due to the fact that I didn't have prepared horseradish, so I grated 3 tbsp of fresh horseradish). Despite adding more horseradish once cooked, I'd probably increase the onion mixture ingredients to intensify the flavor and coat the potatoes better (maybe along with 1/2-1 tbsp of olive oil), and perhaps decrease the amount of broth by 1/4-1/2 c as it does seem to coagulate a bit as it cools, and the broth ended up being quite delicious itself. All in all, will make again.SamanthaChicago, IL12/2/2021This is already one of my favorite recipes. I love gratin, but sometimes it is just too heavy. This perfectly combines light flavors and somehow transforms simple ingredients (potatoes and tomatoes) into luxurious flavor bombs. Also, who knew that horseradish was such a delight? Can't wait to bring this to Christmas dinner and surprise everybody.Tim TLos Angeles, CA11/30/2021Pretty good- however there ended up being a bit too much liquid from the tomatoes and broth.  The flavor was nice though.AnonymousSeattle, WA11/27/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titHorseradishHerbs & SpicesPotatoVegetableTomatoDinnerSideVegetarianRoastRecipes you want to make.
