But as Bon App\u00e9tit contributor Rick Martinez explains, \u201cIf you can spread peanut butter onto a slice of bread, you can make tamales.\u201d Plus, we promise it\u2019s worth the effort; homemade tamales are far better than what you\u2019re likely to find packaged at the store.There are two types of masa, a dough made from ground nixtamalized corn, to choose from for this tamale recipe. One is fresh masa, which offers the best flavor and texture and is available from specialty markets or artisanal producers who grind their own. The other is instant masa, which is widely available and easy to transform into dough on your own. You can find it along with dried corn husks at tortilla stores/factories, international sections at larger stores, and online. Whichever masa you choose, be sure to save some of the chile pur\u00e9e from the pork filling to incorporate for a little extra color and even more delicious flavor in every bite.If you prefer chicken tamales, Rick has a recipe for them too.

Cook onion, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and softened, 6\u20138 minutes. Add ancho, guajillo, morita, and pasilla chiles and broth and bring to a boil. Cover pot, remove from heat, and let sit, stirring occasionally, 30 minutes to allow chiles to soften.Step 2Meanwhile, toast coriander seeds in a dry small skillet over medium heat, swirling often and adding cumin seeds during the last 30 seconds, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Let cool; finely grind in spice mill or with mortar and pestle.Step 3Preheat oven to 250\u00b0. Transfer chile mixture to a blender; reserve pot. Add ground toasted spices, garlic, and oregano and pur\u00e9e until smooth, adding more broth if mixture is too thick or won't blend, about 2 minutes. Reserve \u00bc cup pur\u00e9e for masa and set aside until ready to use. Place pork shoulder, pork belly, bay leaf, salt, and remaining chile pur\u00e9e (about 1\u00be cups) in reserved pot. Bring mixture to a boil, cover pot, and transfer to oven. Braise pork until very tender and it shreds easily, 2\u20132\u00bd hours. Let cool 15 minutes, then skim fat from sauce; discard bay leaf.Step 4Using a potato masher or a large fork, smash pork into sauce until meat is shredded and incorporated into sauce. Stir in vinegar; let cool.Step 5Transfer filling to an airtight container and chill until pork is cold and firm, at least 3 hours.Do Ahead: Filling can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.For Fresh MasaStep 6Mix masa, lard, broth, salt, and reserved chile pur\u00e9e in a large bowl with your hands until well incorporated and mixture looks shiny and smooth, about 4 minutes.ChevronChevronStep 7Slap the top of masa with the palm of your hand, immediately pulling your hand back. If masa doesn\u2019t stick and your hand looks shiny, the dough is ready. If masa sticks, add another 2 Tbsp. lard and knead until incorporated; repeat slap test. If masa still sticks to your hand, repeat process until you get there (another 2 Tbsp. lard should do it).Photo by Alex LauFor Instant Dry MasaStep 8Mix corn masa flour, stock, lard, salt, baking powder, and \u00bc cup reserved chile pur\u00e9e in a large bowl with your hands until dough comes together. Continue to knead until mixture looks smooth and shiny, about 4 minutes.Step 9Slap top of masa with the palm of your hand, immediately pulling your hand back; if dough sticks to your hand, add 2 Tbsp. more lard and knead to incorporate. Repeat slap test. If masa doesn\u2019t stick and your hand looks shiny, dough is ready. If masa sticks, continue adding lard 2 Tbsp. at a time and repeat slap test. Let dough sit 30 minutes, uncovered, until the consistency of peanut butter; it will thicken as it sits.AssemblyStep 10Soak husks in a large bowl of hot water until soft and pliable, about 15 minutes. Using your hands, swirl husks in water to loosen any silks or dirt. Drain, rinse, and shake off excess water.Step 11Place a husk on a work surface and gently stretch out wide end. Measure 5\" wide, then tear off any excess (hold onto the scraps; you\u2019ll use them later). The width doesn\u2019t have to be exactly 5\", but if you go any narrower, your tamale might not cover the filling. This recipe makes about 30 tamales; prep a few extra husks in case some tear.Step 12Arrange husk so wide end is closest to you. Spoon 2 heaping Tbsp. masa onto husk about 4\" from the bottom. Using a putty knife, small offset spatula, or butter knife, spread masa into a thin, even layer, covering the width of the husk and about 5\" up the length of the husk; leave the narrow end uncovered. If you mess up, just scrape off masa and start over. Repeat with remaining husks and masa.Photo by Alex LauStep 13Keeping wide end closest to you, place 2 Tbsp. cold pork filling in the center of masa on each husk, forming a log that runs down the center. Fold 1 side of husk over filling, then fold other side over to cover. Holding tamale seam side up, fold narrow, pointed end of husk away from you and under tamale. Set on a rimmed baking sheet seam side up. Repeat with remaining tamales.ChevronChevronArrange and Steam the TamalesStep 14Line a large heavy pot with husk scraps. Crumple a large sheet of foil to form a 3\"-diameter ball. Place ball in center of pot. Using ball as support, prop tamales upright, with folded end down and seam side facing up, around ball; this will take 4\u20137 tamales. Continue stacking tamales around the ball, leaning them against one another. Pour broth into pot, being careful not to get any inside tamales (broth should come about \u00be\" up sides of tamales). Bring liquid to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low. Cover pot and simmer tamales, undisturbed, adding more stock as needed to keep some liquid in pot, 40 minutes.ChevronChevronStep 15Remove a tamale from pot; let cool 3 minutes. (If you don\u2019t let it rest before checking, masa will stick to husk and appear gummy.) Remove husk; if masa sticks to husk, it\u2019s not ready. Carefully refold and return to pot. Cook 5 minutes more; check again. If husk peels back easily, tamales are done. Remove from heat, uncover, and let sit 10 minutes before unwrapping. Serve with salsa and lime wedges for squeezing over.How would you rate Pork Tamales Rojos?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (25)Back to TopTriangleFollowed the directions to the letter and ended up with a disintegrated wet mess.  Anonymous1/4/2022I LOVE tamales!!! Thank you for posting this although in my Mexican American family growing up helping out in our family restaurant I never really had the urge to make them my self but now I have children and definitely making tamales is too special not too pass on- PLUS they cost way too much at the store \ud83d\ude05 Happy Holidays we will bring in New Year eating lots of yummy tamales\ud83c\udf892022 \u270c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udd4aKariTexas12/28/2021I hate working with corn meal especially when it comes to tortillas and tamales because even the instructions on the package ARE NEVER accurate. My husband gave me a tip as far as knowing if the masa is correct. I made the masa according to the package instructions, but added way more water and enough lard to make the consistency similar to a sticky consistency that can easily come off your hand. Also, if u put a piece of masa in water, it should float because fat floats. That tip lit a lightbulb in my head because I was struggling to get the masa mixed properly and it took me an hour to figure out. I made a modified version of the pork Chile and had to substitute some of the Chilis. I didn't care too much for the pork. I liked my beef tamales instead. Anonymous2823012/25/2021Solid Recipe. I tested the recipe last year using premade masa and the tamales came out GREAT. \n\nJeffEl Dorado Hills, CA12/22/2021I vowed to never make tamales again after spending nearly 24 hours making them my first time. this recipe looks doable- I think I'll try again!Anonymoushouston 12/22/2021Hahaha - remind me again\u2026 how many \u201csteps\u201d involved in spreading peanut butter on toast? Thinking it\u2019s about 16 fewer than this recipe John WPlanet Earth12/22/2021To AV8R in Alabama: I\u2019m a 99er, and an aspiring cook. Of course I wanted to attempt this recipe. Life is short and tamales are good. That, to me,  is pretty simple! Loved the recipe. I will make them again! Thanks BA!AnonymousSeattle12/22/2021Oh come ON.\nYou seriously think home cooks will attempt this?\nIt was fun to read, anyway.\nPlease remember KISS.\nKeep It Simple Stupid.\n\ud83e\udd23AV8Rcoastal Alabama12/22/2021I live in NM. This is not traditional. AnonymousEspanola, New Mexico12/22/2021how many tamales does this make? serving size?jayCa12/1/2021I just wasted a lot of time and a lot of masa (plus my chilli paste) because the author, despite saying that you can use instant masa, did not mention that the amounts of lard and water need to change. Terrible instructions for that. Use steph's instructions to adjust the masa. All of the other comments are the same. A real shame to have this kind of oversight on a 5 year old bon appetit article.TristanOttawa, ON5/10/2021FYI: 3 3/4 cups instant corn masa flour + 1 3/4 cup water + 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder is equal to 3 lb fresh masa. StephBaltimore, MD3/1/2021My lack of tamale knowledge was most to blame here...but I knew something was off when I combined the fat / masa.  With all due respect, I think this could use a revision. I see where I made the mistake, but I could see others overlooking it as well.\n\nJust a suggestion, always enjoy the content here!  And the flavors were definitely on point!  Cheers \ud83c\udf7b Nickp1986Chicago, il1/12/2021Sounds about right. Texan who made tamales either her godmother, here. A couple tips I'd add would be, first, ditch the foil ball. We put an upside down bowl in the pot and  stacked the tamales against it. No need to waste foil. We streamed them with water, as well. Also, add a coin (we used a penny) to the bottom of the pot when steaming. If it stops rattling, you know the liquid is gone and you need to add water. This gives you an audible indication without having to lose the steam/heat if you lift the lid to check.MCSan Antonio12/8/2020These are the most delicious things I've ever made and I'm so glad I took the plunge to try them! The instructions are very helpful and I felt knowledgeable about making these despite not knowing anything before reading the recipe and they turned out so well!Philadelphia, PA4/11/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titMexicanLatin AmericanCentral AmericanMasaRice & GrainsPork ShoulderPorkMeatPork BellyPasilla ChileChileVegetableAncho ChileGuajillo ChileMainGluten-FreeDairy-FreeNut-FreeSteamDinnerRecipes you want to make.
