You can roast the beets and make the dukkah, a coarse Egyptian and Middle Eastern nut and spice blend, for this dish days in advance, then you\u2019ll just need a few minutes to assemble before dinner. The dukkah holds well up to a week; make extra and use to brighten other roasted veg or meat.This recipe was adapted from \u2018The Rise: Black Cooks and the Soul of American Food,\u2019 by Marcus Samuelsson with Yewande Komolafe and Tamie Cook.Ingredients8 ServingsRoasted Beets2lb. small or medium red beets (about 12 small or 8 medium)2Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil2Tbsp. sherry vinegar or red wine vinegarKosher saltDukkah and Assembly1Tbsp. coriander seeds1Tbsp. fennel seeds2tsp. cumin seeds\u00bccup raw cashews\u00bccup raw pistachios1Tbsp. benne seeds or sesame seeds\u00bdtsp.
