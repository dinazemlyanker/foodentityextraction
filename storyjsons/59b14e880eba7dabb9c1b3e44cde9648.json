Welcome, friend: We\u2019ve been expecting you. You\u2019re about to experience the closest thing to actual magic that ever happens in the kitchen. Below you\u2019ll find everything you need to get started, from the necessary equipment to a step-by-step guide to the process, along with Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen-developed recipes and a basic time and temperature guide for when you\u2019re ready to do your own thing. This is going to be fun.The EquipmentA Joule Sous Vide Machine (More on why we love this unit here)A Foodsaver Vacuum Sealer or Heavy Duty Freezer BagsA Large PotPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Anna Billingskog1. Season Your MeatAs with all successful meat cookery, the first step is to season your protein, and season it well. Give it a thorough rub down with plenty of kosher salt, along with any dried spices or pastes you like\u2014freshly ground black pepper, chile powder, curry, harissa paste, whatever you want. One of the advantages of sous vide cooking is that those seasonings get sealed right up against the meat, and have plenty of time work their way in, leading to big flavor.Photo by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Anna BillingskogPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Anna Billingskog2. Bag It (with Aromatics)Once your meat is good and seasoned, slide it into either a food-grade vacuum sealing bag (the gold standard, and what most restaurants use) or a sturdy resealable freezer bag (the best grocery store-available option). At this point you can add any larger aromatics\u2014sprigs of hardy herbs like rosemary or thyme, bay leaves, whole dried chiles\u2014positioning them in direct contact with the meat so that when the bag is sealed, they're locked in place. (A pat of butter, a dollop of coconut oil, or a spoonful of ghee wouldn\u2019t hurt either, but try to avoid anything too liquid-y as it could interfere with the sealing process.)Photo by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Anna BillingskogPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Anna Billingskog3. Get a Good SealIf you\u2019re going the vacuum sealer route, follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. (We like to double or triple the seal in case one of the seals fails.) If you\u2019re working with freezer bags, we\u2019ve got a good hack for getting as much air out as possible. Press out as much air as you can and seal your bag almost all the way, leaving a little gap for air to escape. Holding the corners of the seal, slowly lower the bag into a pot of water\u2014like the one you\u2019re about to cook in\u2014until the water comes right up to the seal, then close it completely. The pressure of the water helps to displace any air you weren\u2019t able to press out on your own. Cool, right? If you need a visual aide, check out this video.Photo by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Anna Billingskog4. Set Your Temperature, Set Your Time, Start CookingTime to get cooking! Fill a big pot with water, set your sous vide machine (aka immersion circulator) up in it according to the device\u2019s specifications, and set the desired time and temperature based on what you\u2019re cooking. Some brands (like the Joule by Chefsteps, our preferred model) have proprietary apps that make it super easy\u2014you simply plug in what you\u2019re making, and the software will determine the appropriate cooking temperature and time. If you\u2019re free-styling, consult our time and temperature guide below based on the official one from Chefsteps. Once the water comes up to temperature, add your bags to the water. Vacuum-sealed bags can be dropped directly into the water and allowed to float around, but when we\u2019re working with jerry-rigged freezer bags, we like to use a binder clip or clothes pin to secure them to the edge of the pot, seal-side up\u2014a little extra insurance that the seal won\u2019t break.Photo by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Anna BillingskogPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Anna Billingskog5. Rest, Dry, and Sear (If You Need to)Once your steak/chicken/salmon/whatever is cooked to the desired temperature, take it out and let it rest, in the bag, for 15 to 20 minutes. (To be honest, we\u2019re not sure if this actually does anything, but we\u2019re hoping it gives the protein a chance to soak up any of the seasoned juices in the bag.) At this point your meat is fully cooked, and is safe to serve. Some proteins are delicious served as-is\u2014boneless, skinless chicken breasts, say, or a delicate fillet of salmon are ready to be sliced, plated, and served. But others, like a perfectly medium-rare steak or a slab of tender pork belly, want to be crisped before serving for optimum deliciousness. In that case, remove the meat from the bag, dry it off as thoroughly as possible with paper towels, and sear it off on all sides in a ripping-hot pan until a beautiful, crackling crust forms\u2014since the meat is already fully cooked, this should only take a minute or two on each side.Photo by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Anna Billingskog6. Serve (or Save)Et voil\u00e0! Dinner is served. But the real beauty of sous vide cooking is in the possibilities for meal planning and prep that it opens up. If you aren\u2019t serving your sous vide creation right away, dunk it in a bowl of ice water to cool it down as quickly as possible, and then transfer it (still in the bag) to the fridge, where it should stay good for up to 7 days, or to the freezer where it will keep for up to a year. Cook up four or five chicken breasts and bring them for lunch all week. Get a bunch of steaks to a perfect medium-rare on Thursday night, and all you have to do is give them a quick sear on Friday night for a nearly hands-off dinner party. The possibilities are endless\u2014go forth and sous vide!Photo by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Anna BillingskogBasic Cooking Times to Keep On-HandBelow is a quick guide to the time and temperatures recommended for different types and cuts of meat, courtesy of the fine folks at ChefSteps, the company behind the Joule. As you get more comfortable with the technique, you may find that you like things cooked to a slightly different time or temperature\u2014totally fine\u2014but this is a good place to start. A note on the time ranges: The first number reflects the ideal time as determined by the company for that particular meat, while the second number is the maximum time that item can remain the water bath without having its texture suffer. You can find a more comprehensive guide on their website.
