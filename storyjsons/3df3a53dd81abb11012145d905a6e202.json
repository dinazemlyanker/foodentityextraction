He starts his mornings peeling shrimp for bento box lunches and ends the night washing stacks of dishes from his elaborate multicourse kaiseki dinners. On a sunny day last fall, I watch as Go emerges from the kitchen of his seven-seat restaurant Hayato, situated in Downtown L.A.\u2019s mega food hall Row DTLA. He carries a tower of wooden boxes; he has only 45 minutes left to assemble the 16 elements that go into each lunch before customers arrive to pick them up.Wearing the typical Japanese professional uniform of a white lab-like coat with a button-down shirt and black tie, Go quietly and methodically grills skewers of miso-shellacked black cod. In between turning the skewers, he plunges a bunch of greens into cold water, then slices jelly-roll-like logs of egg into perfect chubby rounds. As another cook fries lima beans and pulls vegetables from their marinades, Go starts packing everything into the laptop-size containers\u2014not a strand of his slicked-back hair out of place.Go preparing for service at Hayato\nPhoto by Dylan + JeniInside there\u2019s a curl of custardy datemaki tamago (omelet). A cube of sweet potato cooked in water, then light shoyu (soy sauce) and brown sugar to balance its honeyed sweetness. Smoky grilled Hokkaido scallops. A pile of herbal chrysanthemum greens zapped with a squeeze of sudachi citrus. A fat slice of Japanese eggplant simmered in dashi, shoyu, sake, and mirin. Sweet snow crab transformed into curdy, meaty tofu. Crunchy-tender pickled vegetables. Hunks of winter melon, bloated with a gingery dashi.It\u2019s is a full-on tasting menu and the most delicious bento I\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s also the most beautiful with colorful bite-size pieces huddled together in a simple blond box, almost overwhelming to behold.As I eat, Go takes a break from his prep to explain the difference in the cooking methods, lighting up as he describes each approach. \u201cOnce you start teaching people and they see all the techniques and all the special ingredients, they get more interested. It\u2019s like stepping into this whole new world. You want more. You want to learn more. You want to eat more,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what happened to me.\u201dGo\u2019s raw materials: black cod and lots of kombu\nPhoto by Dylan + JeniGo has been cooking since he was 15 years old, making sushi at his dad\u2019s restaurant, Koi, in Seal Beach in Southern California. He would come home after dinner shifts and practice making rice and cutting fish. \u201cWhen I\u2019m interested in something, I just go nuts. I don\u2019t do anything halfway,\u201d Go tells me. \u201cMy dad says I go too far, like why can\u2019t I just make a normal bento with grilled fish, a few pickles, and rice? My mom says I was born like this.\u201dHe didn\u2019t think of cooking as a possible career choice\u2014his family wanted him to become a doctor\u2014so he went to UCLA to study medicine, all the while returning to the restaurant to cook. After being rejected from medical school (\u201cIf I worked as hard at my premed stuff as I do at my restaurant, I would be a doctor right now,\u201d he says), Go decided to go straight to the source of his obsession: Tokyo. He stayed with family and friends and worked at a nearby izakaya. \u201cI thought I knew Japanese food after I had been at Koi for 10 years,\u201d Go says. \u201cBit by bit, I started to realize I didn\u2019t know anything. There was so much to learn.\u201dFor the next four years, he staged under some of Tokyo\u2019s most revered chefs, including detail-oriented Takeshi Kubo of Goryukubo and whimsical Hideki Ishikawa of Ishikawa. He remembers how Kubo rejected his sliced myoga (Japanese ginger) because it wasn\u2019t thin and translucent enough. He remembers bringing the suimono (clear soup) to Ishikawa as he stood outside in the rain bidding a guest goodbye, needing his boss\u2019s approval before serving.  And he remembers all the beautifully boxed and packaged osechi he had to make one holiday season and how they were far tastier than the department store versions he had eaten before. Soon he had the idea for Hayato.Go sold very few bentos (and on some days, none at all) for about three months after he opened the restaurant a year ago. But he pressed on. He\u2019s now selling his maximum lunch order of 16 bentos a day, booked a month in advance for $47. Last summer he launched his kaiseki dinners at the restaurant; the seven seats started selling out almost immediately at $200 a head.Evan Kleiman, radio show and podcast host of Good Food on KCRW, can\u2019t remember exactly how she stumbled upon Hayato\u2014either Instagram or wandering around Row DTLA\u2014but she recalls the moment she understood how exceptional it is. A young Japanese woman was staying with her as part of a student exchange, and Kleiman brought back a bento to share with her. The student burst into tears, blown away, she explained, by each item. \u201cIt made her feel at home, and I can\u2019t think of a higher compliment than that,\u201d Kleiman says. \u201cI was astounded by every bite. Each was so distinct and yet so harmonious,\u201d she says. \u201cAs you\u2019re eating, you\u2019re already worrying that it\u2019s going to end.\u201dOutside Hayato\nPhoto by Dylan + JeniI visit Los Angeles about three times a year, and I always bring with me a very long list of restaurants to try. I cull my spots with help from friends in the publishing industry, chefs I know, locals I trust. For all of its aesthetics and deliciousness, Hayato is barely on the radar. I first learned of it through photographers Jeni Afuso and Dylan Ho, my go-to eating buddies when I\u2019m in town. They emailed me out of the blue early in 2018: \u201cYou have to see what Brandon is doing.\u201dFor his part, Go has decided to eschew any kind of public relations. He says he just can\u2019t afford it, but also that he wants to grow his customer base organically. \u201cPeople that come in after seeing press releases are usually coming in just because they want to keep up with the L.A. food scene, not because they have a huge interest in how we cook,\u201d he says. A small amount of coverage has found him without it\u2014the bento appeared on the cover of Time Out Los Angeles last year and Hayato earned a spot on Los Angeles Magazine\u2019s best new restaurants list at the end of 2018\u2014but Hayato still continues to lay low, for the most part outside of the critics\u2019 profile and review circuit and beyond food-flooded social media feeds.Go isn\u2019t concerned. He\u2019s fine just making the bentos in the almost masochistic way he does and serving the kind of kaiseki he admired in Japan.\u201cMany of the things we make take a long time for people to appreciate. Even for me, when I was in Japan, it took a long time before I realized how special it was that someone was going to the trouble of making these things,\u201d Go says. \u201cHonestly, I feel like the people who really care about Japanese food find me without me having to find them.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurants + TravelChefsJapaneseLos AngelesRead MoreseattleWhy Seattle Is One of the Most Exciting Places to Eat Japanese Food Right NowBy Elyse InaminecultureI Instagram-Stalked This Croissant, So I Found Out How It\u2019s MadeBy Rachel KartenWhere to eatThese Kyoto Coffee Shops Will Turn You into a \u201cCoffee Person\u201dBy Rachel KartenRecipes you want to make.
