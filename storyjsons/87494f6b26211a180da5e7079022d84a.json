Set a 10\u201d-diameter glass pie dish in a roasting pan.Step 2Bring sugar and \u00bc cup water to a boil in medium saucepan, stirring to dissolve sugar, about 3 minutes. Cook, swirling pan occasionally and brushing down sides with a wet pastry brush (do not stir), until sugar turns deep amber, 10\u201312 minutes. Immediately pour caramel into pie dish and swirl to coat to the bottom. Let sit 10 minutes to allow caramel to set.Step 3Blend eggs, sweetened condensed milk, coconut milk, evaporated milk, vanilla, and salt in a blender until smooth. Skim off any thick foam that may have risen to the surface. Strain custard through a fine-mesh sieve lined with cheesecloth into pie dish.Step 4Transfer roasting pan with pie dish to oven and carefully pour hot water into roasting pan to come halfway up sides of dish (if you have one, a tea kettle makes this easy).Step 5Bake flan until just set in the center but still a little wobbly when gently jiggled and barely pale golden on top, 50\u201355 minutes. Carefully remove pie dish from roasting pan and transfer to a wire rack. Let cool 15 minutes. Chill until cold, 2\u20133 hours.Step 6Just before serving, run a knife along edges of flan, set a plate on top of pie dish, and carefully invert flan onto plate. Top with coconut flakes.Step 7Do Ahead: Flan can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.How would you rate Coconut Flan?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (1)Back to TopTriangleThis recipe was very good. We did the full recipe and used 6 ramekins, it was a pretty perfect amount. We tasted the custard before we baked it and it was overly sweet, so we added the juice of 1 lime, this made it really good! (Next time we might use 1.5 limes) The texture on the finished flans was creamy and had zero bubblage, awesome!austen.paulsen4022Plano, TX1/6/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titCustardDessertCoconut MilkOther IngredientsGluten-FreeBakingRecipes you want to make.
