It comes together in less than 30 minutes and reheats like a dream for meal prep. Win-win.The recipe calls for hot Italian sausage, but I\u2019ve made this with mild sausage or a pound of ground pork to equally wonderful results. The clutch trick is grating garlic and ginger right into the meat mixture so it is flavored throughout before it gets all crisp in the pan. (It\u2019s important to let it sit and sear for 6\u20138 minutes so it gets super brown instead of gray and sad!)Make sure ground meat is super crispy before you flip it over!\nPhoto by Alex LauOut goes the meat and in goes sliced shiitake mushrooms, which get crispy and tender in the residual pork fat, and a ton of cabbage. Six cups! I use two bags of the pre-shredded green cabbage from Trader Joe\u2019s because I\u2019m lazy, but Napa cabbage\u2014the one called for in the recipe\u2014has a sweeter, milder flavor, and is worth seeking out if you\u2019re not lazy like me.ooo cranberries\nPhoto by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiEqual parts soy sauce and unseasoned rice wine vinegar coat everything in the skillet and turn into a simple-yet-flavorful sauce. You are supposed to toss in half the cabbage to wilt and then put the rest in raw so it\u2019s still crisp-tender, but I prefer it all to be tender and incorporated with the sauce, which sometimes means adding a little more soy and vinegar before finishing with chives, a drizzle of sesame oil, and sprinkle of sesame seeds for a mildly garlicky, nutty finish.Now is the best part: wrapping it all up! If you can find mu-shu wraps at your local Asian grocer, that\u2019s ideal to make this like mu-shu pork, but if not, flour tortillas are a nice, pillowy wrapper for the tender, deeply flavorful, saucy meat and veg. Spread a warmed tortilla\u2014I like Trader Joe\u2019s handmade white tortillas, which are nice and chewy\u2014with hoisin sauce and Sriracha to taste, nestle the meat mixture in, roll it like a taquito, and take a big ol\u2019 bite.Eat this over a plate, because you\u2019ll inevitably spill some of the mixture, and make a pot of rice if you\u2019re making this for meal prep. And hey, you only have one skillet to wash, since everything happened in one pan, and you have plenty of time to lie horizontal on the couch for the rest of the night. You\u2019re welcome.Get the Recipe:One-Skillet Hot Sausage and Cabbage Stir-Fry with ChivesSaut\u00e9 hot Italian sausage meat with ginger and garlic, mix with veg, and dinner\u2019s a wrap!View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyStir-FryPorkSausageCabbageOyster MushroomsMushroomSoy SauceRice VinegarNever FailRead MorecookingThese Crispy Meatballs Are My New Weeknight Secret WeaponBy Aliza AbarbanelcookingHow to Make Meatballs That Are Tender, Juicy, and Delicious Every TimeBy Alex DelanycookingLarb Is the I-Had-a-Bad-Day Weeknight Dinner You NeedBy Carey PoliscookingHow to Brown Meat So It's Actually, You Know, BrownBy Claire SaffitzRecipes you want to make.
