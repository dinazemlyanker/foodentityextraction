I\u2019ve loved Ina since I was a teenager, and gravitated toward watching Barefoot Contessa because her style of cooking very much reflects how a lot of the women in my family approach it. Unlike a lot of semi-homemade BS cooking shows, she actually cooks real food for her friends and Jeffrey. So I watched her, and then I did the same for my family.When I was 15, I saw her make linguine with shrimp scampi, so I scribbled down the ingredients, went to the store, and just cooked it. I have always been an instinctual cook, so I don\u2019t think I followed the recipe to a T, but picking up tips, like not fully draining your pasta water, were hugely valuable to me. I was tasked with making after-school meals for me and my two younger brothers, and this was always a highly requested recipe. It was easy and quick to make, and we all fell in love with it. We\u2019d often sit on the sofa and eat it while watching Ina on TV and doing\u2014or not doing\u2014our homework.It was also a source of inspiration for future meals. I often made other versions of this dish, adding clams or squid into it, or whatever the market had that looked good. That\u2019s something fantastic about a tried-and-true recipe\u2014it\u2019s always there for you to rely on, even if you change some of the components.I connect with Ina because we both relish our time in the kitchen and focus on using simple ingredients\u2014while making sure they are the best ingredients possible. At the end of the day, no matter how complicated our recipes are at The Beatrice Inn, when I go home, that\u2019s how I like to cook. I live in New York and have a small kitchen, so I want things that will be super easy and won\u2019t require a lot of cleanup, but I don\u2019t mind taking the time to make something delicious.Although I haven\u2019t made this particular recipe in a very long time, I am writing a cookbook right now and there\u2019s a langoustine and spaghetti that very much stems from all of that after-school cooking of Ina\u2019s recipe: an homage to the same shrimp scampi that I made when I was 15.\u2014As told to Alyse Whitney\u00a0Ina Garten\u2019s Linguine with Shrimp ScampiFrom Barefoot Contessa Family StyleServes 6I wrote this recipe for my column in Martha Stewart Living magazine called \u201cEntertaining Is Fun.\u201d Except for the shrimp, you probably have most of the ingredients around the house and when you\u2019re late from work, it\u2019s a quick meal to pull together for dinner. Buy peeled and deveined shrimp and it\u2019s even faster!Vegetable oilKosher salt1\u00bd pounds linguine6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter5 tablespoons good olive oil3 tablespoons minced garlic (9 cloves)2 pounds large shrimp (about 32 shrimp), peeled and deveined\u00bd teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\u00be cup chopped fresh parsleyGrated zest of 1 lemon\u00bd cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (4 lemons)\u00bd lemon, thinly sliced in half-rounds\u00bc teaspoon hot red pepper flakesDrizzle some oil in a large pot of boiling salted water, add 1 tablespoon of salt and the linguine, and cook for 7 to 10 minutes, or according to the directions on the package.Meanwhile, in another large (12-inch), heavy-bottomed pan, melt the butter and olive oil over medium-low heat. Add the garlic. Saut\u00e9 for 1 minute. Be careful, the garlic burns easily! Add the shrimp, 1 tablespoon of salt, and the pepper and saut\u00e9 until the shrimp have just turned pink, about 5 minutes, stirring often. Remove from the heat, add the parsley, lemon zest, lemon juice, lemon slices, and red pepper flakes. Toss to combine.When the pasta is done, drain the cooked linguine and then put it back in the pot. Immediately add the shrimp and sauce, toss well, and serve.Recipe reprinted from Barefoot Contessa Family Style: Easy Ideas and Recipes That Make Everyone Feel Like Family.
