I want a bit of heat, but mostly I want flavor. I want something I can put on everything, from eggs to rice to whatever sandwich I\u2019m making.Turns out I want the hot sauce at Jack\u2019s Wife Freda. I just didn\u2019t know it till the immensely popular New York City lunch-and-brunch spot opened an outpost a few blocks from my apartment in Chelsea.JWF (we can just call it that, yes?) makes its own sauce\u2014a creamy (looking) verdant green concoction that delivers just enough bite while singing of garlic, cilantro, and fresh chiles.Whenever I order takeout from JWF, I always request a few extra containers for my fridge and I end up reaching for it all week. But now that I know how simple it is to whip up the stuff after reading through the cookbook they published a couple years ago, I might just have to start making it myself.Jack\u2019s Wife Freda Hot Sauce1 jalape\u00f1o chile1 serrano chile3 garlic cloves2 bunches of cilantro, stems removed\u00bc cup sunflower seed oilKosher saltSlice the jalape\u00f1o and serrano chiles into half-inch rings, seeds included.Put the chiles into a blender with the garlic and cilantro.Add \u00bc cup water and the oil and blend on high speed for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the mixture is smooth and consistent.
