It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Challenge acceptedI made Chris\u2019s eggplant and pork recipe from the Farmers\u2019 Market Challenge last weekend and I can\u2019t recommend it enough. But I wasn\u2019t the only one who made it. Christal Yuen wrote about this recipe in (fittingly) The Greatist: \u201cIt\u2019s got a kick of spice from the chiles, pops of crunch from the toasted sesame seeds,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt tastes so good, it derailed my week.\u201d Well, that last part is terrible news. You okay Christal? Was that you I saw listening to new Bon Iver on a park bench, crying and pointing at random strangers\u2019 big dogs? Eggplant works in mysterious ways.Make it: Stir-Fried Eggplant with Basil and ChilesY\u2019all are making Pop-Tarts?!Readers are actually making Claire Saffitz\u2019s gourmet Pop-Tarts and it\u2019s amazing.Speaking of aspirationsThe Coveteur visited Claire Saffitz\u2019s kitchen, where she was casually making a layered funfetti cake, as one does. But my eyes were on those neat and tidy squeeze bottles of sherry vinegar and marsala wine, the evenly labeled HOMEMADE VANILLA, and the bounty of lemons. So many lemons, Claire! Whatcha gonna do with all those lemons?!I\u2019ll have what Wishbone\u2019s havingI had a fantastic Turkish meal at Lokanta in Astoria this week. The sweet, tangy, and creamy carrot and yogurt dip made me nearly lose my mind, until I tried the smoky but light and clean baba ganoush, the neon red muhammara (red pepper and walnut sauce), and baby lamb chops I ate like lollipops. Owner and one of New York\u2019s finest characters, Orhan Yegen, was zooming around the restaurant checking on everyone, some of them friends and regulars, who he\u2019d take a seat with, tell a wild story, sip some wine, and take a bite of whatever was being served\u2014quality control. When a couple came in with a small, Wishbone dog who sat in his own chair, Orhan dropped off three menus.Want this letter before it hits the website?

Dennis (learn what griot means when you read it), an absolute page-turner (or page-scroller) that widens your mind and makes your stomach desperate for this food. Hilary watches chef Gina Capers-Willis \u201cstir a big pat of butter into creamy grits and then spoon smothered garlic crab on top. Ella [Gina\u2019s mother] approves, giggling at my clumsy attempts to extract the sweet crabmeat as she chomps right through a claw with her 86-year-old teeth.\u201dRead it: People Say Gullah Geechee Culture is Disappearing. BJ Dennis Says They're WrongCourtesy of Driscoll'sWhat will they pink up next?Driscoll\u2019s announced a brand new ros\u00e9 strawberry and raspberry this week and as someone generally interested in plant sex, I thought it was kinda interesting. In Peru, they\u2019re breeding potatoes to be more nutrient rich for the sake of public health. In America, we\u2019re breeding berries to be cuuUute. \u201cThese gorgeous blush-colored strawberries and raspberries are bred for their unique (and highly instagrammable!) color and aromatic flavor,\u201d read the cheery press release. \u201cRos\u00e9 Raspberries get their sunset coloring from their parents, the golden and red raspberries. As with the Ros\u00e9 Strawberry, the flavor profile promises a sweet taste sensation.\u201d SWEET TASTE SENSATION. When a berry hits my lips and I get that sweet taste sensation, oooEEE. My whole body starts to jiggle and wiggle. My eyes water happy tears. My wallet opens up as if by centrifugal force, BUY MORE BERRIES, it screams. THEY CUTE. Gotta check these out.Recipe comment(s) of the weekOn ratatouille pasta:On tomato toast:Crowdsurfing with croquemboucheWe sent the very funny, boneless wing-hating Jimmy O. Yang crowdsurfing with a croquembouche at Outside Lands last weekend, I guess?Freaky-deaky fan art of the weekUnnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekWhen I mentioned I made this chia limeade last weekend (I loved it!), a discussion about ~textured drinks~ rang out. Specifically, orange juice with pulp. \u201cNo-pulp orange juice feels like drinking water,\u201d said pro-pulper Rachel Karten. \u201cI want to know I\u2019m getting some fruit in there.\u201d \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t have pulp, it\u2019s not fresh\u2014and it tastes like mashed up vitamins,\u201d declared Hilary Cadigan. Priya Krishna is \u201cskeptical of all orange juice that isn\u2019t squeezed in front of me.\u201d Adam Rapoport said his son is staunchly anti-pulp, but he is fine with pulp, and then he told a short story about when Tropicana introduced \u201cno pulp\u201d in the olden days of yore. Okay. Emily Schultz calls pulp \u201cicky\u201d because it \u201cgets in your teeth, you need to floss after, and no one likes the combo of orange juice and mint.\u201d TRUE STORY, SCHULTZ! Christina Chaey is team pulp-less: \u201cI like smooth soups, smooth peanut butter, smooth orange juice\u201d and presumably, Santana\u2019s \u201cSmooth\u201d ft. Rob Thomas. And we all know how Tony feels.Oh also, friends, I\u2019ll be in Southwest Michigan this weekend. Any places I should eat, drink, or be wary?
