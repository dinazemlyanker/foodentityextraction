The citrusy olive oil sauce that naps on these noodles does just that, bringing out the spaghetti\u2019s limber, delicate nature. \u201cCoco Chanel that s**t,\u201d he says. \u201cShe was all about restraint.\u201d Do your best to thinly slice the asparagus on a deep diagonal so that it bends and twirls around your fork just as easily as the spaghetti does.Ingredients4 servings1lb. spaghetti\u2154cup extra-virgin olive oil1large bunch asparagus, trimmed, thinly sliced on a deep diagonal4garlic cloves, smashed43\"-long strips lemon zest\u00bdtsp. crushed red pepper flakes8large basil leaves2lemons, halved2oz.

It was much too lemony - very sour. \nI think it would be helpful if you gave a quantity of lemon juice as the size of lemons varies quite a lot. \nI will make this again with half the amount of lemon juice. AnonymousEau Claire Wisconsin 3/7/2022How come the video from the test kitchen uses heavy cream and butter and yet the recipe does not? There is no asparagus in the video?\n\nHow about setting aside the strips of lemon zest and zesting the rest of the lemon into the heavy cream (where in the recipe is this?) and then adding butter???\n\nThe \"Molly makes Pasta al Limone in the Test Kitchen\", yet the directions do not detail the steps like the video. So I gather that this video is not for the recipe nor any of the other videos on the right side of the screen.\n\nWhat gives???Joe2752712/1/2021Fabolous dish! Definitely adding it to my repertoire of meals.CreaperMo10/12/2021Quick (esp if you do some prep ahead of time), easy and tasty. And healthful, right?AnonymousWethersfield, CT9/16/2021I made this for tonight\u2019s dinner and it is amazing, flavorful and just delicious. I love the hint of lemon in this dish. Despite using the pepper flakes, it is not as spicy as I thought it would be. Everything just blends together so well. The simplicity of the dish all together is refreshing. It was super easy to make and did not take long at all to prepare. The ingredients are things most people already have in the cupboard. I will definitely make this again!!! Thank you for sharing!!!AnonymousWyomissing, Pa9/11/2021why, why,  why,  do people leave comments when they don\u2019t even make the exact recipe I don\u2019t want your stupid changes to the recipe I just want to know if you made it as listed and how it came out.   I plan to make it tomorrow night as listed in the recipe thank youAnonymoussan francisco9/3/2021I added shrimp, used gochugaru instead of chili flakes, and added a kaffir lime leaf. Fresh basil from the garden. Excellent, subtle lemon. Next time, I will use twice the asparagus. Robs MuirClaremont, CA7/7/2021This is absolutely delicious. I've made it once and can't wait to make it again. Thank you.TESKingston, Ontario Canada6/14/2021Loved the recipe, added some oyster mushrooms and cherry tomatoes and sauteed some shrimp too. perfect dinner!Dan NishLos Angeles, CA12/27/2020I have made this numerous times and I gotta tell you folks....F A N T A S T I C  !!\nIf you want a fast, light, easy to prepare meal then this is it.Big JoeMontreal,Canada12/26/2020Excellent. I used less oil, more asparagus and less lemon (1.5 lemons instead of 2). Also used traditional lemon zest as the wider lemon zest strips are more bitter. AnonymousToronto11/15/2020This is the second time I make this pasta dish. It's easy, so incredibly delicious and it's the best way to get my toddler to eat asparagus! Will become a regular staple when I cook dinner. mmenessCalifornia 7/30/2020Made this for dinner last night, but didn't have asparagus on hand so added some boneless chicken to make it more of a meal. It was quite tasty, a little heavy on the lemon for some tastebuds but will definitely adjust and make again! I think this would work really well with shrimp/seafood, might try that next time. AnonymousQueens6/9/2020Soooo oily and bland. The vegetable to pasta ratio was off too.Anonymous6/5/2020We absolutely loved this!  It was quick and easy and delicious, and can be adapted in so many ways based on what is in the fridge and pantry.  I added some pea shoots and garnished with a little fennel pollen and black pepper.  This will be a regular in our rotationshansterama6818Madison, VA6/5/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titPastaItalianEuropeanSpaghettiPasta & NoodlesAsparagusVegetableLemonCitrusFruitParmesanCheeseSpringWeeknight MealsEasyQuickMainVegetarianHealthyishSaut\u00e9DinnerRecipes you want to make.
