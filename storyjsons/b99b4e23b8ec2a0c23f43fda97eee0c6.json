The graphic to-go bags that line the entrance. The fun food posters on the wall that remind me of works by famed Egyptian artist Hassan Hajjaj (he\u2019s photographed Cardi B!). And have you seen the LED ceiling?! I had serious design envy.It's all inspired by the streets of Cairo, with the branding by playful brand agency &Walsh and the restaurant design by creative studio AE Superlab. When I first went to Zooba, I thought it would just be to check out the decor. But when I sat down to eat, I ended up falling in love. Every dish was so delicious and nostalgic for me, having grown up not too far from Egypt in Saudi Arabia. Eating ful medames\u2014stewed fava beans and Egypt\u2019s national dish\u2014was my family\u2019s Sunday ritual as a kid. Now, going to Zooba is my weekend ritual in my home away from home.All my friends are at Zooba: za'atar fries, baladi bread, and bessara (fava bean dip).\nFrom the oozy cheese hawawshi (fluffy baladi bread stuffed with a tender meat-veg patty and creamy roumy cheese) to the pickled lemon ta\u2019ameya (freshly fried balls of mashed fava beans) to the za\u2019atar fries, Zooba is my go-to spot for lunch. And dinner. And...really anytime I\u2019m craving Egyptian food (which is often). I\u2019ve basically become Zooba\u2019s unofficial ambassador, taking any friend in town or the whole art team to the restaurant on a given day. Design might have been the gateway, but it\u2019s really all about the Egyptian food here.Go there: ZoobaExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsNew York CityRead MorerestaurantsMy Favorite Sausage in NYC Is Served at a Ukrainian Joint Under a Chiropractor's OfficeBy Alex DelanyRecipes you want to make.
