It\u2019s not that this weeknight dinner brings to mind Cool Ranch, but rather that the balance of sweet, salty, and spicy is so perfect, it\u2019s as though the same people who engineered Doritos to be addictive had a hand in this recipe. (They didn\u2019t\u2014it was all Andy Baraghani.)So if it\u2019s not Frito-Lay mad science that\u2019s responsible for the hit-every-taste bud-you\u2019ve-got thing, then what is? It\u2019s a marinade that\u2019s a mix of sugar, fish sauce, garlic, and chiles, a super concentrated paste that delivers flavor in record time (that record is 10 minutes).And it's as easy as it is delicious. The recipe uses mostly pantry ingredients, so as long as I have the wherewithal to buy shrimp on the way home (or if by some miracle I have some in my freezer), I have what I need to throw it together. It takes about 20 minutes from the moment I walk in the door until I sit down to eat. And it requires close to zero technical skill, so even if I\u2019m simultaneously sending emails and getting lost in a true crime podcast while cooking, it\u2019s still disproportionately good.All of which makes it an excellent meal for when I\u2019m getting home late from work and I really just didn\u2019t have time to think about dinner\u2014not so unlike a giant bag of Doritos, come to think of it.Better than Doritos:Shrimp and Basil Stir-FryThere\u2019s so much more you can do with your farmers\u2019 market basil than making pesto!View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titNever FailShrimpWeeknightStir-FryRecipes you want to make.
