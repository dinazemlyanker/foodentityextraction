At this sprawling indoor market on Granville Island, located centrally on False Creek, you\u2019ll need to plan your visit accordingly to avoid the crowds, but there are a lot of compelling things to eat. Come hungry.ORDER THE: Montreal-style bagels from Siegel\u2019s; bison bresaola from Oyama meats; smokehouse cheddar or bleu b\u00e9n\u00e9dictin from Benton Brothers Fine Cheese; lobster and fish cakes from L\u2019Epicerie Rotisserie and Gourmet Shop; smoked candied salmon or sablefish from Longliner Seafoods; spot prawns off the dock, if in season; the giant fritter (if you\u2019re feeling brave) from Lee\u2019s Donuts; and a small jar of birch syrup from the Edible Canada shop just opposite the market.THE VIBE IS: busy and eclectic, with tourists and locals alike. Once you\u2019ve purchased your bounty, head outside and set up a picnic next to False Creek.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day, from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.\u2014Lindsay AndersonGrant HarderGrant HarderGrant HarderWE ALSO LOVEBeta5A Mount Pleasant sweets shop pushing cacao boundaries since 2011St. LawrenceTake a \u201ctrip\u201d to Quebec via Vancouver\u2019s Downtown EastsideRodney\u2019s Oyster HouseSerious oyster curation in Yaletown, but that\u2019s about where the seriousness endsExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
