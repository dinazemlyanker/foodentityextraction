I had eaten a double scoop of corn and sesame gelato for lunch and then cheesecake for dessert, after I met a goat named Yuki.How did I decide to visit this bizarro version of Provence (lavender fields, yogurt everywhere, lots of cows...)? It wasn\u2019t a slapdash combo of friend recommendations, Trip Advisor, and Google research but rather one source that has been sitting on my bookshelf since 2015.Rice, Noodle, Fish: Deep Travels Through Japan\u2019s Food Culture, written by Roads & Kingdoms co-founder and publisher Matt Goulding, doesn\u2019t fall into the too-familiar look-I-ate-somewhere-cool-now-I\u2019m-going-to-wax-way-too-poetic world of travel books.Instead, in it, and his subsequent two books published in 2016 and this past June\u2014Grape, Olive, Pig about Spain and Pasta, Pane, Vino about Italy\u2014he focuses chiefly on the people behind the food: tempura chefs, pig butchers, mozzarella makers. Sure, Goulding eats a lot of multi-hour wine-soaked meals too. But the books work so well because he includes conversations about clashes of tradition versus modernity, and highlights how immigrant communities have changed traditional foodways for the better.Take the Sicily chapter in Pasta, Pane, Vino in which Goulding interviews Palermo\u2019s three-time mayor Leoluca Orlando and asks him at what point migrants can consider themselves palermitani.\u201cFrom the second they arrive in this city,\u201d says Orlando. \u201cThe resident card is the new form of slavery, the migrant boats the new slave ships. We need to accept globalization isn\u2019t just an economic reality but a human one, too.\u201dThe Ballaro market in Sicily.\nChelsie CraigGoulding then ties Orlando\u2019s point of view to food. No longer is Sicily a region solely devoted to Southern Italian classics. Instead, you find arancini\u2014the traditional Sicilian fried rice ball\u2014stained with saffron as a nod to Africa. You find couscous with chunks of lamb on the same trattoria menu as pasta alla Norma.I trust Goulding as a writer\u2014and someone to take vacation advice from\u2014because he doesn\u2019t only show the happy side of travel. Goulding might love Italy, but he also acknowledges how easy it is to get a mediocre gelato in Rome (same rules as New York City, but instead of avoiding Times Square food options, avoid restaurants around any gladiators or famous fountains). While he\u2019s made Barcelona his (part-time) home, he addresses the impact of the \u201chomogenous cruise-ship economy,\u201d the constant political strife tied to Catalan independence, and other daily realities that wear off some of that Gaudi sheen.A full-page \u201camazing shit in the middle of nowhere\u201d spread.\nChelsie CraigEach chapter is about a different region or city, and can focus on a singular story (like the gooseneck barnacle gatherers of Galicia) or encompass multiple aspects\u2014I got hooked on Hokkaido from Goulding\u2019s vignettes on artisan breadmakers, his summary of the sheer amount dairy around, a profile of a soba noodle chef, and the fact that he ate nothing but donburi for several days. Between each chapter, there are full-bleed photos with one-page breakdowns of dishes, or a recurring series of \u201cAmazing Shit in the Middle of Nowhere.\u201d It\u2019s a chance to highlight aspects of food and travel that maybe don\u2019t make sense within a chapter, but are still worth writing about.And, each book starts with impassioned back and forth emails between Goulding and the late Anthony Bourdain\u2014this series is part of Anthony Bourdain\u2019s book imprint. You feel a little bit of Bourdain on the pages\u2014never too shiny, with food descriptions containing just the right level of effusiveness and not a drop more. In the intro for Pane, Pasta, Vino, Goulding asks Bourdain if the world needs another book about Italian food. Bourdain responds:\u201cTo me, after thirty years of cooking, of garnishing, of torturing and manipulation food into being pretty enough or \u2018interesting\u2019 enough to sell to an ever-fickle dining public, another two decades of experiencing every type of culinary genius or frippery, there is a deep satisfaction and joy in food made with enough confidence and love to take three or four good ingredients, cook them right, and dump them unceremoniously on a plate. Better yet is if the cook feels good enough about the food to serve it with a rough, not particularly good, local wine. That makes me happy.\u201dMe too\u2014I\u2019ve booked a trip to Italy next month.Get the books for $20 each on Amazon:Rice, Noodle, Fish Grape, Olive, PigPasta, Pane, VinoThen hit the road:All products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
