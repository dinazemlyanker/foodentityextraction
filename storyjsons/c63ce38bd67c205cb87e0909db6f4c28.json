But the good news is that the internet exists! We\u2019ve rounded up some of the best places to buy fish online for that sheet pan salmon and clams arrabbiata you\u2019re craving.We\u2019ll level with you: It\u2019s more difficult to get quality fish shipped to your door than it is to order meat online. And that\u2019s because of a number of factors at play. Although not all farmed fish is bad (we recommend Seafood Watch to learn more about how to be a responsible consumer), much of the fish we stand by is wild-caught using sustainable fishing practices. That means that there\u2019s a seasonality to many types of fish, and just like you can\u2019t get wild ramps in January, you can\u2019t get fresh Dungeness crab in September.Additionally, no one is interested in shipping salmon from Alaska to Florida via UPS Ground. Sending fish via next-day air comes at a price, which is why many of the purveyors on this list sell in bulk to make purchases more cost effective. Confused about what to do with ten pounds of halibut? Flash-frozen fish will keep in your freezer for months. If you\u2019ve ever frozen fish at home yourself and been less than enthused with your thawed-out fillet, fear not; the fish you\u2019re getting will have been rapidly frozen within hours of being caught, making for much better results. Just make sure you leave time for it to fully thaw in the fridge. Let\u2019s get fishing, shall we?All products featured on bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
