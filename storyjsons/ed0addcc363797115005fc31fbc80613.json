Cover and chill.How would you rate Soy-Ginger Dinner Scramble?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (26)Back to TopTriangleThis dish is my go-to comfort food. I find I don\u2019t need quite so much rice, and if I\u2019m pressed for time (or just tired), it\u2019s fine to leave the cucumbers fresh and skip the pickling step. The vinegar in the rice is plenty of acid. \n\nI\u2019ve made this dish at least once a month for years. Even the biggest soy or ginger skeptics will enjoy this combination of textures, temperatures, and flavors. Edith B.Providence, Rhode Island 3/26/2022The pickled cucumbers are delicious! Who knew rice vinegar and honey could do so much?! But the eggs were... not good. The flavor was really off \u2014 I can\u2019t put my finger on it, but I suspect it\u2019s the butter (there\u2019s a reason why it\u2019s almost never used in Asian dishes!). Plus, if you use regular soy like I did, expect a pile of gray, muddy-looking eggs. Jen NealNYC, NY2/12/2021Embarrassed to admit as much as I love eggs, I'm just not great at seasoning them unless they're pickled for ramen. This was really good, easy, and filling. Used brown rice and added a bit more seasoning to it. BilliePittsburgh, PA1/27/2021Really delicious, though I would definitely suggest adding more soy sauce on the rice. I pickled some round slices of carrots, too. Would also be nice with a bit of sweet chilli sauce and beansprouts. This dish reminds me of a similar taste to Vietnamese omelettes. I'm making it again for lunch!PhoebeGlasgow, UK1/26/2021OMG!!  This dinner is scrumptious and quick to pull together. Never better eggs. Anonymous1/21/2021Oh my god, this is now one of my favorite dinners. Period. This is so delicious it's insane; it's a go to now, and my relationship with eggs has been forever changed. MAKE THIS NOW. I cannot recommend it more. Though fair warning, if you use regular soy sauce and not white soy sauce, the eggs will not be the beautiful yellow color you see in the photo, they will be tinted brown. Still ungodly delicious but won't look like you expected. AnonymousChicago, IL11/4/2020Simple, foolproof, tasty, fun! Add heat and crunch if you love heat and crunch. AnonymousWashington, DC5/12/2020This recipe is fantastic and exceeded my expectations! Thank you Chris for another favorite that we will go to again and again for a quick weeknight dinner! The ginger, soy and mirin do wonders for the eggs and the cucumbers add a delightful brightness and crunch! Topping with sesame seeds is a must! AnonymousLong Beach, CA5/6/2020Excellent, easy way to get some protein and to jazz up pantry staples. Still good if you can\u2019t make the pickles, but they take it to the next level.Royal Oak, MI, USA5/2/2020Lo in the time of quarantine when the delivery driver does pick up the wrong cucumber, this dish does still deliver excellent flavor with minimal effort.AnonymousUnited States5/1/2020Great recipe! I could see eating this for breakfast as well. \nAdding fresh ginger and mirin to the eggs is INCREDIBLE - I never would have thought to do this. \nSuper, filling, and delicious. AnonymousSeattle, WA4/24/2020This was amazing and so very filling. During the time of quarantine, this recipe creates something delicious with pantry staples. Definitely use the mirin! Makes all the difference.  900264/23/2020This is so incredibly delicious! And easy! My go to recipe when I don't feel like making supper.  The flavours compliment each other so well!
