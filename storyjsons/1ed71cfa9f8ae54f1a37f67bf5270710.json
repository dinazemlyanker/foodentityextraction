The crunchy anchovy panko topping is optional but highly recommended.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Definitely a keeper.  As one other reviewer said I also added the baby spinach in at the end along with sliced calamari for some protein.  Served to guests, it could be made up through adding the water and then finishing just before serving.  I used shells and the Panko is a must for both flavor and crunch.SherwoodSeattle, WA3/19/2022This was delicious but I would make it with less water- probably a half cup less. The sauce was too loose for me and I couldn\u2019t cook it off without overcooking the pasta. I also had to add a little extra salt (even with these salty ingredients), and I think reducing the water slightly would fix that too. Otherwise it was fast, easy, and tasty! Will be cooking again. Sara MSt. Petersburg, FL2/22/2022Loved this dish! Made a couple of changes to the recipe: I opted to add the spinach at the end to keep it fresh and also added some shrimp which worked so well with the flavors of the recipe. StephanieNew York2/21/2022Perfect in every way. Very comforting! Didn\u2019t have kalamata or spinach, subbed tapenade + lacinato kale. Highly recommend.LPBrooklyn, NY2/20/2022Delicious. Did not have kalamata or capers in the house, subbed Morrocan olives and used more anchovies in both parts. Next time would roughly chop the spinach ahead of time and wait until the pasta was 1/2 cooked before adding the spnach, it got a bit overcooked and stringy with with 12 minutes of simmering. Make 2x the anchovy breadcrumbs because they're genius and hands-down the best part.KT2/17/2022I happened to have every ingredient already in my pantry so I eyeballed it (just make sure you taste along the way), and it came out super tasty and savory!
