Ceremonial is the highest grade of matcha and is made for drinking from the youngest tea leaves. Culinary matcha is still high-quality but has a more robust flavor, allowing it to shine through when combined with other ingredients.

My only revision is the amount of salt in the dressing. I poured out 1 1/2 tsp into a bowl and realized that it would be way too much so I used half of it. It was still really salty, and I normally love salt.
