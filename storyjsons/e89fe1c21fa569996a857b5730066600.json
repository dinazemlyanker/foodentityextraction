But leave the skin and bones intact: The skin insulates its tender meat during grilling, and the bones help keep the pieces together.Ingredients2\u20134 servingsSauce\u00bccup raw pistachios10prunes, pits removed, coarsely chopped1garlic clove, finely grated2cups finely chopped parsley1cup finely chopped mint\u00bccup finely chopped tarragon\u00bccup kimchi or sauerkraut brine2Tbsp.

Let cool, then finely chop.Step 2Gently mix pistachios, prunes, garlic, parsley, mint, tarragon, kimchi brine, and vinegar in a medium bowl to combine; season with salt. Whisk in oil, then taste and season spoon sauce with more salt\nif needed.Fish and AssemblyStep 3Prepare a grill for medium heat. Using a chef\u2019s knife, cleaver, or serrated knife, cut fish crosswise into 2\"\u20134\"-wide planks (the larger the fish, the wider the planks); halve planks if fish is large. Pat fish dry, rub all over with oil, and season with salt and Aleppo-style pepper. Grill fish, undisturbed, until about 70 percent cooked through (use a knife to slide into flesh to check), about 5 minutes. The skin should release easily from the grate when the fish is ready to turn. If it\u2019s sticking, keep cooking.Step 4Using a large fish spatula, turn fish over and grill until cooked through (fish is done when a paring knife easily pierces the flesh along the side), about 2 minutes.Step 5Transfer fish to a platter and spoon sauce over.How would you rate Grilled Flatfish With Spoon Sauce?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (1)Back to TopTriangleSo easy to make and full of flavor.
