That day was sticky and wet, and the grass below me was sharp, freshly cut. It had been weeks since I\u2019d left the house, glued to my seat, one Zoom chat after another. But today was for self-care, to unplug, to feel the sun on my face.Vi\u00f1a Maitia Aupa is traditionally made with grapes from a 120-year-old vineyard and drinks like a full-bodied ros\u00e9.\nPhoto by LAURA MURRAYAll I brought with me to the park was a book, a wine key, and a chilled bottle of Cacique Maravilla\u2019s Pipe\u00f1o Pa\u00eds. I\u2019m hesitant to call pipe\u00f1o-style wines natural, which now comes with a certain cool-kid baggage, but of course that\u2019s what they are. Typically, these unfiltered wines are made of Pa\u00eds, a native Chilean grape, farmed with low-intervention methods, and exhibit a hazy ruby color while spontaneous fermentation contributes a whisper of effervescence. But to me these descriptions and categorizations erase the work of winemakers like Manuel Moraga Gutierrez, whose family has been making Pa\u00eds-based wines for seven generations in Chile\u2019s Biob\u00edo region\u2014and long before your friend in Brooklyn started crowing about natty wines.Louis-Antoine Luyt Pipe\u00f1o Portezuelo is one of several pipe\u00f1os the brand makes\u2014each highlighting a different farmer. This one from Patricio Martinez is particularly juicy.\nPhoto by LAURA MURRAYAs wine importers and somms quest for the next great thing, they\u2019re seeking out wine styles like pipe\u00f1o. This category dates back to the 16th century, at least, and is kept alive by Chilean farmers. Recently, it\u2019s gained popularity Stateside because of the demand for \u201chonest\u201d wines made from native grapes and ancient vines. Pipe\u00f1o is meant to be drunk young, and this bottle speaks of the farmers who enjoy pipe\u00f1o on the regular. It\u2019s enormously gulpable, bright berries and crisp acidity all the way down.There\u2019s arguably no better wine to pair with the sunset. As the burning ball in the sky started to dip below the tree line and I slowly uncorked the wine, the bottle\u2019s gentle exhalation felt like my own sigh of relief.Explore Bon App\u00e9titWinenatural wineThe PourRead MoreLifestyleThe New Burgundy Wines Are Not as Bougie as You ThinkBy Marissa A.
