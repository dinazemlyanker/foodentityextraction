The word chitranna translates to \u2018mixed rice\u2019 in Kannada. There are numerous variations, all relying on different souring agents such as lime, green mango, tamarind, or, in the case of the one I grew up eating most often, lemon.\u201d To make it a meal, serve it with Green Beans Palya, raita or yogurt, and achar, and read more about the recipe here.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Pour in fresh water to cover generously. Let soak 30 minutes.Step 2Drain rice and transfer to a medium saucepan or a rice cooker. Add 1\u00be cups water, then mix in \u00bd tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bc tsp. Morton kosher salt and \u215b tsp. ground turmeric. If using a medium saucepan, bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to low. If using a rice cooker, press cook. Cook until rice is tender and there is no water remaining, 12\u201315 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit, still covered, 10 minutes (this will allow the grains to separate). Fluff rice with a fork and spread out on a rimmed baking sheet; let cool.Step 3If using \u00bc cup frozen grated coconut, microwave in a small bowl in 15 second bursts or place in a colander and set under warm running water until thawed. If using \u00bc cup dried unsweetened shredded coconut, place in a small bowl and pour in hot water to cover. Let sit until ready to use.Step 4Heat 1 tsp. vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium. Add \u00bc cup raw or unsalted roasted peanuts, preferably with skins, and cook, stirring, until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain; season with salt. Wipe out and reserve wok.Step 5This next part will happen quickly, so measure your ingredients out before you start cooking. Combine 1 tsp. chana dal and 1 tsp. urad dal (if using), \u00bd tsp. black mustard seeds, and a pinch of asafetida in a small bowl. Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. vegetable oil in reserved wok over medium-high. As soon as oil is shimmering, add a mustard seed. When the oil around the seed starts to sizzle or the seed starts to move, add remaining spice mixture. Cook, covering with a lid as needed to contain the mustard seeds while they are popping and stirring so mixture evenly toasts, until very fragrant and sputtering has subsided, about 1 minute.Step 6Reduce heat to low. Break 1 dried red chile in half and add to wok. Rub 4\u20135 fresh curry leaves between your fingers to release oils and add to wok. Cover immediately (the moisture from the curry leaves will cause the oil to spatter). As soon as sputtering subsides, uncover and stir to evenly coat in oil.Step 7Add cooled rice and remaining \u00bd tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bc tsp. Morton kosher salt to wok. Cook, stirring, until combined, about 2 minutes. Stir in \u00bc cup fresh grated coconut, thawed frozen coconut, or drained dried coconut and cook, stirring, until combined and warmed through, about 1 minute. Remove from heat.Step 8Cut 1 lemon in half. Coarsely chop leaves and tender stems from \u00bc bunch cilantro. Squeeze juice from lemon into chitranna. Measure out 2 Tbsp. chopped cilantro and add to chitranna along with peanuts. Taste and season with more salt if needed.Step 9Top chitranna with remaining cilantro. Serve with Green Beans Palya, raita or yogurt, and achar.All our friends are here!\nPhoto and Food Styling by Sarah JampelStep 10Do ahead: Rice can be made 3 days ahead.

So am I. This recipe is legit. Not that you need my validation to believe this dish is YUMMY AF. Cook it, taste it, and tell me I'm wrong. \nAlso, such amazing kudos to bringing South Indian dishes to light - so exhausted by the constant recipes for chicken tikka masala. Never thought I'd see my daily childhood dishes here!AnonymousMinneapolis8/27/2020I made this with brown basmati rice and a 1/4 tsp of Kashmiri chilli powder for extra spice - it was phenomenal! I didn't have skin-on peanuts so used a mix of roasted salted peanuts and plain cashews. Paired with the green bean palya it was a perfect lunch. AnonymousLondon, UK8/27/2020I really liked making this chitranna, and I paired it with the Green Beans Palya. The only substitution I had to make was I used basil leaves instead of curry leaves. \n\nI definitely think that the asafetida is required for this dish and can't be substituted. I bought chana dal and urad dal for this, but could see using some substitutions if those are difficult to find. (Though I didn't have issues finding them in an Asian Market).AnonymousPhoenix, Arizona, United States8/20/2020Why is an American impostor of northern Indian heritage violating a sacred Deccani dish?TheSwordofTipuZultanMysore, India8/18/2020Why is an American impostor of northern Indian heritage making Deccani food?TheSwordofTipuZultanDeccan8/18/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSouth AsianAsianIndianRiceRice & GrainsTurmericHerbs & SpicesCoconutFruitCurry LeafEasySideVegetarianVeganGluten-FreeDairy-FreeDinnerBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
