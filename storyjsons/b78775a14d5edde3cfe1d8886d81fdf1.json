Some soups are bad. Some soups are good.\u00a0By Alex BeggsJanuary 30, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Laura Murray, styling by Judy Mancini.FacebookTwitterEmailI read this at the Bon App\u00e9tit Live Foodcast in Brooklyn a few days ago (you can listen to it on the podcast in the coming weeks!) and I think it was funnier out loud because I grabbed my buttcheeks and made weird faces and was generally awkward as hell. But I still feel the same feelings. And on the internet, I\u2019m a lot less sweaty. So here you go: 16 soups in order from worst to best.Cabbage. No.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig16: Do you... like making eye contact with a coworker in the bathroom mirror and then rushing into a stall to rip a huge fart? NOoooooOooooo. It was cheap to start with a fart joke but you can\u2019t have that kind of tension in the workplace. Cabbage soup\u2014a laxative by any other name\u2014you\u2019re on the bottom rung.Missing something.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl Jones15: Sometimes a soup teeters too close to the line between being a soup and a pasta sauce. You know what would make those soups better? Noodles. I\u2019m talking about tomato soup. Uh, what are these little bumpy bites I\u2019m getting? So much...tomato. Why are we pretending to like whatever dried oregano tastes like? Where\u2019s the spaghetti?!?! This soup is a scam invented during the spaghetti depression and I\u2019m not buying it. Bad soup.Gravy.\nPhoto by Heidi's Bridge, styling by Anna Billingskog14: Contrary to popular belief, the phrase \u201cI creamed myself,\u201d does not refer to a weird rash you got from bathing in Cream of Mushroom soup. Apparently this is a soup people eat\u2014perhaps mistaking it for watery gravy\u2014and we really can\u2019t have that.13: No soup thinks more highly of itself than Manhattan Clam Chowder. Your property value isn\u2019t higher because you swapped heavy cream for low-cal tomato juice. And I don\u2019t care how historically accurate it is. Sticking leeches on your buttcheeks is historically accurate, that doesn\u2019t mean I wanna do it. Manhattan Clam Chowder needs to go back to wherever it came from, which is probably...Connecticut?12: I just want to take a quick pause to say: bone broth is not a soup.Nutritious.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Susie Theodorou, Prop Styling by Sophie Strangio11: The following soups only seem like a good idea when I\u2019m in a midtown Hale and Hearty: lentil, seven bean, and mushroom barley. In every other situation they\u2019re undesirable. There\u2019s a reason you don\u2019t start a $300 dinner at Le Coucou with a pebbly bowl of mushroom barley. It\u2019s edible, it\u2019s nutritious, but it\u2019s undesirable, like a Woody Allen movie in 2020.SEO bait.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Yekaterina Boytsova10: Speaking of soggy noodles, chicken noodle is a dumb soup. Just roast a chicken and eat that. Make some buttered egg noodles instead. The chicken\u2019s dried out and bland, the noodles are mushy, the carrot coins are trying to choke and murder me\u2014there\u2019s no redeeming ingredient here. I knowww Molly recently developed an actually-great-blah-de-blah recipe for Basically chicken noodle soup, which you can find at eatbasically.com, but between you and me, that was for SEO. Because y\u2019all still want to make this. And I\u2019m not stopping you.9: You can wine and fine dine me and I\u2019ll probably perceive lobster bisque as a good soup. Until I step back and look at it objectively. You got your hands on some sweet and tender and EXPENSIVE lobster meat and you want to overcook it in hot cream? And I certainly don\u2019t want to drink it from shooters at show-offy wedding receptions. This is why you\u2019re in credit card debt, Stacy.Yes.\nPhoto by Emma Fishman, food styling by Pearl Jones8: Okay that was a lot of negativity and some of it I meant with all my heart, but my heart is big and can hold a lot, like a huge stock pot of gumbo. Oh you don\u2019t like the slimy okra surprises? I do not care! This is a variety pack of soup. Tiny bouncy shrimp. Spicy spices. Rice joins the party. Andouille floats by. Man can in fact live on gumbo alone, just ask my 90-year-old grandpa Jim, who\u2019s been making it every week since the Dust Bowl. Still kickin\u2019!No.\nAlex Lau7: The following green soups are bad: celery, asparagus, chilled cucumber (shudders). The following green soup is good: split pea. We can forgive its mushiness because this is an entire soup that revolves around the making of a HAM. You have to have cooked an entire ham to make split pea soup, and ham is one of the greatest foods. Then you get little flecks of ham in the soup to remind you of how wonderful life was, a few days ago, when you had even more ham. (Sigh.)Luv u.\nMatt Duckor6: My heart goes a\u2019flutter for tom kha soup, the spicy-sour Thai coconut milk and chicken soup that has no flaws whatsoever. It doesn\u2019t coddle you with pure creamy coconut milk. It drops some Thai chiles in the bowl to wake you the hell up. Great soup.Steam me up.\nPhoto by Amber Fouts5: When my face is directly over a steaming basin of pho, my glasses fogging up and my pores opening, sometimes I get so distracted by temporary blindness I forget about the soup beneath. Then you get to start playing with it. Squeeze of lime here. Extra fish sauce there. I like to drop the bean sprouts in one sprout at a time saying \u201cnow your turn!\u201d And unlike some OTHER soups mentioned earlier, you GET YOUR NOODLES.Refreshing!\nAlex Lau4: This opinion does not reflect the rest of the BA staff: Gazpacho is good. Yes, it\u2019s cold and chunky and in the wrong bowl, might be mistaken for salsa. But I like it! Tangy tomatoes all mushed up. A puddle of olive oil on top. Croutons. Drinking it makes me feel like Daisy Buchanan in that scene in The Great Gatsby where everybody\u2019s hot and sweaty and rich. Remember that? An entire chapter describes this lady fanning herself on a couch. Bet she\u2019d love a bowl of gazpacho!Party!\nPhoto by Stephen Kent Johnson, Food Styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, Prop Styling by Kalen Kaminski3: Posole: a soup that\u2019s literally thousands of years old and still very much bangs. The Aztecs made posole on special occasions, which in their case, involved human sacrifices...uh...but for you... it could be the Super Bowl! This pork and hominy soup is inherently rich and filling but then you get the TOPPINGS: Chicharr\u00f3nes! Tostadas! Avocado! How could you get bored in a world with posole in it?Package deal.\nPhoto courtesy of Veselka2: This one has conditionals. Borscht has to be eaten at a Ukrainian diner, slippery pierogies need to also be on the table, and YOU need to be wearing a white t-shirt. There is no greater flex. Please don\u2019t tell me if there\u2019s cabbage in it. I don\u2019t want to know.WOW.\nEva Kolenko1: By now you\u2019ve probably deemed everything I\u2019ve said a lie, which is fiiine. But when you tuck yourself into bed tonight under a duvet you saw on a subway ad, think about how you\u2019re recreating what it means to be French onion soup: the best soup. Some French chef, or a rat under one\u2019s hat, was like, what if we made, like, a pot pie with a cheese crust instead of dough? Oui chef! Brilliant idea, little rat. And underneath, a pile of caramelized onions in beef stock and a sunken island of bread, not much else. WOW. Hell of a soup. Let\u2019s follow that up with steak frites, too much wine, and tarte tatin and then go to bed and die happy.Explore Bon App\u00e9titSoupRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
