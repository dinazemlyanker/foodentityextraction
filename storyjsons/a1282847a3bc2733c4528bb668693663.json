It's like a colander, but on a stick!By Alex DelanyFebruary 21, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailFor the most part, I don\u2019t like having spiders in my kitchen. Or anywhere, really. When it comes to spiders, I\u2019d rather just...not. (If you have any friends that are spiders, please, just don\u2019t mention this to them.) I will make an exception for one spider, though: my beloved wood-handled, stainless steel spider.No, not a piece of stainless steel that is shaped like an eight-legged creature. I\u2019m talking about the kitchen tool, the one that looks like a mini flattened colander with a long handle. (It\u2019s called a spider because the woven metal netting resembles a spider\u2019s web.) Much less creepy than an actual spider.Pot-to-pan pasta perfection.\nSomeone gave me my first spider\u2014I didn\u2019t go out looking for one. But what a gift it was, because it's since become one of the most reached-for tools in my kitchen. The perforated bowl is perfect for transporting pasta from pot to pan (while reserving the pasta water), lifting items like dumplings or thinly-sliced potatoes (read: chips) out of sizzling oil, and picking blanched vegetables like carrots or green beans out of boiling water.A spider in action.\nYes, yes. Those are all great applications, but in my opinion, a spider is actually best used when when making eggs. Hard-boiled, soft-boiled, and jammy eggs. Any egg that goes in boiling water benefits from being carried in a spider. The spider makes it easy to lower multiple eggs gently into a pot, and removing them three at a time is no problem either. Eggs love spiders, and spiders love eggs\u2014it's the perfect boiled egg tool.These eggs were carried, lovingly, by a spider.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigThe best part? You don't need a fancy or expensive one to reap all of those benefits. The Joyce Chen spider that I have is cheap and pretty perfect, IMO. The wooden handle is comfortable and lightweight. The bowl of the spider is about 5\u201d wide, the perfect size for scooping up everything from dumplings to orecchiette to eggs. And you know what? I actually think it's pretty cute. It\u2019s sure to liven up the handmade ceramic crock (or large mug, if you\u2019re less of an adult, like me) you keep all of your spoons and ladles in.Look, this is an easy upgrade. It costs less than ten bucks, and will help you overcome any fears you may have of boiling water or splattering oil. You need a spider in your kitchen. But one you bought and put there on purpose\u2014not one that crawled in through the window. Gross.Buy It: Joyce Chen Stainless Steel Spider on Amazon for $8.58And once you have that spider, make some rigatoni:Rigatoni with Sausage, Beans, and GreensOur favorite and best method of making pasta\u2014the same one the pros use in restaurants\u2014is one in which the pasta finishes cooking in a glossy sauce made by emulsifying cheese into the pasta cooking liquid. It\u2019s so easy and good it might change your life (or if not your entire life, then definitely your weeknight pasta game).View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyToolsBA RecommendsRecipes you want to make.
