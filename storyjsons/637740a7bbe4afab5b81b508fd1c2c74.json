It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Spicy Pork SauceAround the office we called it \u201cSambal-ognese.\u201d Chris Morocco\u2019s new weeknight sauce that we\u2019re all crazy about. Buttttt some fact-checking happened and we couldn\u2019t really call it that in the final edition. Bolognese is beef, this is pork. It cooks in a half hour, not three hours. No milk. Etc. The recipe also takes a few cues from pad kee mao\u2014soy sauce, ginger, basil. It ultimately became its own thing. And a beautiful thing. Spicy and unabashedly punchy, flavors don\u2019t meld together here as much as scream in a punk chorus. During tastings, people would drop by to try it, uninvited. It was rude but understandable. The sauce is ...awesome... sauce. I made it for dinner using Korean rice cakes instead of noodles and it was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve made in 2019. The other was switching to Geico.Get the recipe: Spicy-Sweet Sambal Pork NoodlesBrad\u2019s career trajectoryBrad Leone\u2019s new show, \u201cIt\u2019s Alive: Goin\u2019 Places,\u201d debuted this week and you should probably watch it so we can keep making magazines and employing people\u2014no pressure. I caught up in the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen with the host, Bradford Leone, about what this is even about. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s Alive\u2019 was based in the kitchen,\u201d he explained, \u201cbut this is dedicated to travel. Four episodes in one place.\u201d Season one is Texas! There are bison! \u201cIt ended up being about world health,\u201d said Professor Brad, and then three minutes of \u201cregenerative agriculture\u201d talk around the espresso machine ensued. \u201cAre you talking about bison poop?\u201d I asked. \u201cWell, yeah, that\u2019s a part of it.\u201d Two more minutes of talk about bison aerating soil: \u201c...and we just scratched the surface!\u201d Brad brought back a Stetson hat. \u201cI had to buy it with my own money, but I got a good deal,\u201d he said. \u201cI wore it everywhere. I was ma\u2019aming people, holding doors. Texas brought the gentleman out in me. Then when I landed in New York I had to take it off immediately.\u201d Put your beanie back on, buckaroo.Here\u2019s how to watch it!Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Reese\u2019s Thins, reviewedWe tried the new Reese\u2019s THiNS this week. No paper wrapping! Some of the chocolates were so thin, there was nothing in the little sleeve. (They were empty. Factory error?) Half of the staff, including Meryl Rothstein, felt \u201cthe peanut butter ratio was off.\u201d When I bit into it, I had to squint to see the fine line of peanut butter product slipped in there. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t have the peanut buttery payoff I\u2019m looking for,\u201d reviewed Carla Lalli Music. The other half of the staff loooooved them. \u201cThe PB in thick Reese\u2019s gets kind of pasty and dry,\u201d said Rachel Karten. \u201cThese were gloopy in the good way, like real peanut butter. I needed four to satisfy the craving of one Reese\u2019s though.\u201dOverheard in the Test Kitchen\u201cSo that\u2019s your thing now? You\u2019re a loaf pan girl?\u201dMysterious barbecueMy favorite genre of outside readin\u2019 is murder mysteries. But regular mysteries will also do. I just finished the latest edition of Best American Mystery Stories 2018, edited by my hero Louise Penny, and there were two great stories about FOOD and I can\u2019t stop thinking about them. \u201cSmoked\u201d by Michael Bracken takes place at a middle-of-nowhere barbecue stand in Texas that gets discovered by a food magazine (while the pitmaster is hiding from something worse than long lines); in \u201cTakeout\u201d by Rob Hart, a Chinatown delivery guy drops off terrifying omens instead of egg rolls. OoooOoo.Unnecessary food meme of the weekWhat are \u201cFroats\u201d?Frozen oats. Think frozen oat milk \u201cice cream.\u201d Hey, I\u2019m just the messenger.**Regurgitator of press releasesUnnecessary food feud of the week\u201cThere\u2019s a sliminess to it,\u201d said Claire, who was back in the Test Kitchen this week surrounded by approximately 15 cakes. She was talking about the rise of foolproof, slow-roasted salmon. But too often it can have a texture closer to raw if you undercook it. \u201cI want my salmon cooked all the way through so that it flakes on its own,\u201d said Claire, a reasonable request. She cooks it on the stovetop. So does Andy Baraghani: \u201cI\u2019m a skin on, pan seared, finished in the oven kind of guy.\u201d Carla wants crispy skin, so she cooks it stovetop as well, which some home cooks can fear for overcooking. \u201cIt gets dry and stringy when it\u2019s well-cooked\u2014cat food town.\u201d Christina Chaey \u201chad a traumatically undercooked salmon recently,\u201d and therefore cooks hers \u201chard,\u201d which either means on a hot skillet or on the back of speeding motorcycle. When Carey Polis slow-roasts salmon, she has to serve it at two different temperatures, \u201cone for my mom, and one for everybody else.\u201d (It was a staff theme that moms prefer well-done salmon. Why? How?) Emma Wartzman fears the fine line between medium-rare and well-done, so better safe than sorry\u2014she cooks it slow-roasted. Rachel Karten is a slow-roaster all the way: \u201cIt gets tender, buttery, fall-apart-y. I\u2019m scared of over-cooking it on the stove.\u201d \u201cClaire and I are right,\u201d concluded Andy. \u201cAre there winners in this feud? Because we win. And I want my prize to be a pork chop.\u201dCook salmon how you feel the most comfortable! By asking someone else to do it!Some salmon ideas, slow-roasted, stovetop, grilled, cured, all the ways!Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecookingBA\u2019s Best Bolognese Is a Sunday Gravy for All TimeBy Alex BeggscookingWeeknight Dinner Party?
