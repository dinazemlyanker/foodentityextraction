The dressing is perfect and the cheese was a perfect counterpoint to the tomatoes. I made my own crispy shallots since there is no chance that our little local grocery carries them. This will be a rare indulgence, prob for guests. Jkeva410Shenandoah Valley, VA8/25/2021Divine. My local (rural) grocery store does not carry crispy shallots, so made my own from our recent shallot harvest. Will make again and again, and would serve to the Queen of England.jkeva410Quicksburg, VA8/24/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladTomatoVegetableBlue CheeseCheeseShallotOnionLettuceLeafy GreensSummerQuickEasySideGluten-FreeVegetarianLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
