It says a lot about our salt-of-the-earth, glass-half-full optimism\u2014even when the glass is a fountain, and the fountain is completely empty.The restaurant\u2019s mustachioed greeter invites guests to come as they are.\nPhoto by Sunny FrantzIt also says a lot about us that, even as the kitchen\u2019s competency has wavered about as consistently as the mini Fontana di Trevi\u2019s, the restaurant has always been the city\u2019s favorite spot to celebrate. It\u2019s where my grandparents had their dates, free from the kids for one night, and the site of many birthdays, graduation dinners, and fetes on down our family tree. It doesn\u2019t really matter that the food\u2019s having a real moment under the current chef, or if the classic red sauce menu\u2014chicken diavola, tiramis\u00f9\u2014has evolved to include nduja salami, berbere spices, and local pea shoots and mushrooms. At its core, nothing really changes.\u201cIt\u2019s somehow dated and timeless at the same time,\u201d Banas says of the restaurant. \u201cIt\u2019s dark and full of things from all the previous owners. The fountain leaks and drives me insane. I don\u2019t know why Lombardino put it there, but I can never get rid of it. It\u2019s all a part of the DNA.\u201dMadeleine Davies is a writer living in New York.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsItalian AmericanRed SauceWisconsinRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
