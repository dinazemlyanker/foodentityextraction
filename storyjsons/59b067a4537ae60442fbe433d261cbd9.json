But there\u2019s also the most charming coffee shop, a pop-up within a brewery that\u2019s worth lingering in a little longer, and creative neighborhoods to wander and walk it all off. Looks like you\u2019ll be heading to the Windy City very soon.Check out more food-focused itineraries from our favorite food people here.A pile of hot dogs and fries at Gene & Jude\u2019sPhoto by Nick Holmes, @nickdoesfoodInside Four Letter WordPhoto by Nathan Michael\u00a0ChicagoChicago is known as the city of neighborhoods\u2014let that be your guide when visiting, even if only for a day. Start in Logan Square at one of my favorite bakeries, Pan Artesanal. It\u2019s a mix of old-school Mexican and new-school American pastries and full of creative flow. The menu is constantly changing and they sell out quickly, so get there early!Then savor your morning cup at Four Letter Word, a beautifully designed but cozy caf\u00e9. I like to begin with an espresso, then take a drip coffee to-go.For lunch, hop over to West Town\u2019s All Together Now. I usually grab a sandwich or salad, but it\u2019s also perfect for filling a basket with artisanal cheeses, snacks, and wine to enjoy at one of the city\u2019s beautiful parks.In McKinley Park, Marz Community Brewing Co. has more than 20 beers on tap and serves some of Chicago\u2019s best beer, but stay for the food: Chefs Randi Howry and Kelly Ijichi run Mom\u2019s, a Japanese-inspired concept. My favorite dishes are the doughnuts (Sundays only!), the katsu sando, and the fried Spam musubi\u2014it\u2019s all so good!A few miles north in Pilsen, you\u2019ll find the perfect mix of art, music, and food. Be sure to check out the murals on 16th and 18th Streets and Semillas Plant Studio for the cutest plants (my pandemic hobby!), pots, and other locally-made curiosities.Just beyond city limits, in River Grove, sits the classic late-night hot dog stand, Gene & Jude\u2019s. There you\u2019ll find a snappy Vienna Beef hot dog, stacked with sport peppers, relish, onions, mustard, and tons of fresh-cut fries. Gene & Jude\u2019s also offers another Chicago staple: tamales. Chicago-style \u201ctamales\u201d aren\u2019t anything like the tamales that I grew up eating in Mexico. They\u2019re similar to steamed polenta filled with what reminds me of an Indian curry. The first time that I had one I was in disbelief. But after living in Chicago for 10 years, I can accept that this dish is called tamale. It\u2019s a thing of its own and it\u2019s delicious.WHERE TO STAY:The Robey, in Wicker Park, for spectacular skyline viewsWHAT TO BRING BACK:\u00a0A jar of giardiniera from West Town\u2019s Bari Subs and Italian FoodsExplore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsTravelChicagoRecipes you want to make.
