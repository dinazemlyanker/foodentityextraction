And yet the recipe I\u2019ve given you this month is exactly that: a giant tray of roasted vegetables. Let me explain.My general philosophy when it comes to feeding my kids is to cook what I crave, then find ways to add bait that will bring them to the table. This warm sheet-pan salad takes inspiration from fattoush, the bright, juicy-crunchy Levantine salad of tomatoes, cucumber, herbs, and crispy pita bread we love to eat during the summer. In the middle of winter, I opt for a seasonally appropriate cast of squash, cabbage, and red onion, which get roasted on high heat until the squash caramelizes, the cabbage frizzles and crisps, and the onion becomes toasty and mellow. I finish them with cider vinegar, which adds complex sweetness, and sumac, the tart spice that\u2019s essential in classic fattoush.Who can resist the chip?\nPhoto by Laura Murray, food styling by Mariana VelasquezSure, Deb, you\u2019re thinking, but it\u2019s still a tray of vegetables. At this point I\u2019m not above adding some kid bait. First are the aforementioned crispy pita chips, which are so delicious and easy that I\u2019ll often toast extra pitas to entice the salad-hesitant among us. The second is Halloumi, a feta-like salty brined Cypriot cheese that\u2019s often grilled, but when roasted becomes golden brown and pillowy soft.Which leads me to my final piece of bait: marketing. When the kids ask what\u2019s for dinner, \u201cpita chip salad\u201d will beat out \u201cwinter vegetables with Halloumi\u201d every time. When it\u2019s time to eat, the adults can take satisfaction in the fact that we got exactly what we wanted: a big bowl of vegetables, with no one under the age of 10 any the wiser.Get the recipe:Warm Winter Vegetable Salad With HalloumiDeb Perelman\u2019s fattoush-inspired, picky-eater approved salad with creamy squash, crispy pita chips, and chewy, charred cheese salad.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titWinter SquashCabbageOnionPitaPicky Eaters\u2019 ClubVegetableRead MorecookingFor Dinner That Comes Together in No Time, Make Red Bean Soup with Taco FixinsBy Deb PerelmancookingWhen in Doubt, These Hummus Bowls Are the AnswerBy Deb PerelmancookingFor a Kid-Friendly Cacio e Pepe, Just Add CornBy Deb PerelmancookingWhen It Comes to BLTs, There Are No SubstitutionsBy Deb PerelmanRecipes you want to make.
