That direction is important. It\u2019s too easy to walk by Taqueria Los Cocuyos, the unassuming taco stand on a never-not-busy street in the historic center of Mexico City. But then you see the giant meat jacuzzi, filled to the brim with everything from ojo (cow eyeball) to tripa (tripe), and locals huddled around the salsas. And you know you\u2019re there.Each taco costs around $1, and you should 100 percent order more than you think you\u2019ll want. During my last visit, I opted for the suadero (brisket), longaniza (sausage), and cachete (beef cheeks), all served on corn tortillas\u2014and then went back for a second suadero because I am a smart human. Each piece of meat is pulled from the big metal pot and chopped on a fat-stained cutting board. While you can\u2019t go wrong with any of the tacos, the suadero is The One for me\u2014moist and fall-aparty and showered with cilantro and chopped onions. Yeah, I think it\u2019s time for me to look up flights to Mexico City\u2026Go there: Taqueria Los CocuyosExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendMexico CityTacoRestaurantsRecipes you want to make.
