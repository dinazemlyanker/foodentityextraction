By the time of his death in 2018, the chef, author, and travel documentarian\u2019s signature attitude, unrestrained honesty, and willingness to go where others wouldn\u2019t had earned him hordes of fans. Now, for the first time, we\u2019re granted a look into Bourdain\u2019s life behind the scenes. For Bourdain: The Definitive Oral Biography, Laurie Woolever\u2014a writer, editor and Bourdain\u2019s longtime assistant\u2014interviewed nearly 100 people in her former boss\u2019s inner circle. Through intimate quotes from friends, family, and past colleagues the book paints a vivid, honest, affectionate, and deeply nuance portrait of Bourdain\u2019s life and work. In this excerpt, Nigella Lawson, writer, television host, and Bourdain\u2019s costar on The Taste, remembers her friend \u2018Tony.\u2019I met Tony at dinner, a long time ago, the late nineties, probably with the food critic A. A. [Adrian] Gill, in London. He didn\u2019t frighten me at first, but I found him daunting, because he was quite manic. He had his silver thumb ring, and [was] wearing black leather.I didn\u2019t feel we got to know each other very much, but he was very much being Tony, many stories. From that dinner, he told everyone that I\u2019d eaten aborted lamb, which is an embellished story. I was saying there were practices in France where they take the lamb out before it\u2019s born and eat it. So he embellished that into a story about how that\u2019s what I had done. I can\u2019t tell you what trouble that got me into.I really got to know Tony while doing The Taste. Such an unlikely program for him to be involved in. He\u2019d been speaking to Kinetic, the production company, and the deal was, we would do it only if we were doing it together, and we were both EPs [executive producers]. Knowing that he was doing it, as far as I was concerned, guaranteed that it would have integrity.I wasn\u2019t particularly comfortable doing it, but I loved doing it, because I liked hanging out with Tony and Ludo [Lefebvre]. We\u2019d often go out eating in between times, but Tony really needed to be alone and in his trailer a lot. The only time I saw him outside was when he was still smoking. You\u2019d be filming and there\u2019d be a relight, and he\u2019d be editing a book or finishing something, writing something. He didn\u2019t give himself that much time off, on purpose.He was a very introverted person, which people misunderstood in a way, because of his facility with people, but he was always a slightly detached presence. Enormously friendly; he would look at you in a terribly warm way. And when he needed to pull back, I just felt there was something, like many introverts, he just needed a bit of space around him.He was such a strange mixture between an extraordinarily measured person and sort of a manically obsessive person. I think that\u2019s why he was always so fascinating. I always used to describe him [as] something like Gary Cooper mixed with Keith Richards.I loved being in his company. When you\u2019re young, what you want of people is that they\u2019re funny and clever. And then as you get older, you realize kindness is important. But it\u2019s not often that you meet people who are funny, clever, and kind. And he was.In terms of people who looked up to him\u2026I think he was very acutely sensitive to what they needed, and what he was going to give, which is why he always gave such a dazzling performance.Sometimes, as much as he could be, he was quite relaxed. I would like to think that he took for granted that he didn\u2019t have to perform in my company. I would say he was not a flirtatious person, but I also think I wasn\u2019t a woman he needed to win over.We talked a lot about things other than ourselves. We\u2019d talk about books. And he always wanted to add things to his life. He was never closed off to the recommendation of a book or a film.He\u2014as I did\u2014liked being in the Chateau Marmont for a month. I think it gave him a certain sense of stillness, but he was busy all the time; we had very early starts. I love being busy and not having time to think about myself or life. It\u2019s actually quite rare that you can do it away from home, but in a fixed place, for a month. It was quite a treat.I remember saying to him\u2014because he would have the spaghetti Bolognese [at the hotel] most nights, or an In-N-Out Burger\u2014\u201cTony, the food is so bad here.\u201d And he said, \u201cIf the food were good, it would ruin it. People would come here for the food. That\u2019s not why you come here.\u201dI put my breakfast tray outside, and it would [stay there] longer and longer. And once it was up to about four trays, and I complained to him. He said, \u201cNigella, you\u2019re getting the Chateau all wrong. Obviously, they can\u2019t do room service cleanup, but if you kill someone by accident, they will remove the body, no questions asked.\u201dEveryone felt they knew him. That\u2019s what television does to you, and his particular form of television. I think it\u2019s very difficult, because you\u2019re dealing with a lot of people who need something from you, emotionally\u2014they\u2019re coming to hear him speak, and for someone who was quite turned in on himself, as an introvert, he was, more than a lot of men, quite porous in the sense of feeling people\u2019s needs.He wasn\u2019t like that with producers; he was quite capable of cordoning himself off and not really troubling himself about displeasing. But in terms of people who looked up to him, the sort of people who might come and hear him speak, I think he was very acutely sensitive to what they needed, and what he was going to give, which is why he always gave such a dazzling performance, with moments of showing vulnerability to people. That\u2019s why I think people responded to him.I\u2019ve experienced living through people\u2019s illness, and then dying, and it takes you a long time afterward to remember them not ill. And when you remember [them] at last as not ill, you feel something\u2019s been given to you. And I find it hard now to think of Tony in a way that isn\u2019t really very focused on the end. I feel the shock has slightly taken the other pictures away.From Bourdain: The Definitive Oral Biography by Laurie Woolever. Copyright \u00a9 2021 by Anthony M. Bourdain Trust UW.
