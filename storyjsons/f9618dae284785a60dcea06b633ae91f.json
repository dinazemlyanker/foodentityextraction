He modeled his burritos after the ones served at Golden Pride, a drive-thru burrito chain he grew up with in Albuquerque. \u201cThere are two ingredients that are non-negotiable in New Mexican\u2013style breakfast burritos: shredded hash browns and New Mexico chiles,\u201d See says. You can customize everything else in this breakfast burrito recipe based on what\u2019s in your fridge. For the dried New Mexico chiles in the sauce, See recommends Made in New Mexico\u2019s sun-dried red chiles. For jarred green chiles, he reaches for Zia Hatch Chile Company\u2019s roasted and jarred chiles.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook until chiles are soft, 10\u201315 minutes.Step 2Transfer chiles and cooking liquid to a blender; pur\u00e9e until smooth. Strain red chile sauce through a fine-mesh sieve back into pan; discard solids. Whisk in salt and flour and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, whisking constantly, until thickened, 5\u20137 minutes.Do ahead: Sauce can be made 1 week ahead. Transfer to an airtight container; cover and chill.BurritosStep 3Remove chorizo from casings if needed and place in a small saucepan. Add 1 cup red chile sauce. Cook over medium heat, stirring often and breaking up sausage with a spatula, until sausage is cooked through, 8\u201310 minutes.Step 4Meanwhile, peel potato and grate on the large holes of a box grater. Transfer to a fine-mesh sieve and rinse under cold water to remove excess starch; drain well and pat dry. Transfer potato to a medium bowl. Add garlic powder, \u00be tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt, and \u00bc tsp. pepper and toss to coat.Step 5Heat 3 Tbsp. oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add potato, pressing gently. Cook, undisturbed, until a golden brown crust forms, 5\u20137 minutes. Break up potato with a spatula and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown all over, 6\u20138 minutes more (add more oil if pan seems dry). Transfer hash browns to a plate.Step 6Return skillet to medium heat. Add eggs and butter; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring with a heatproof spatula, until eggs are glossy and just set, about 3 minutes. Scrape eggs onto a plate and wipe out pan.Step 7To assemble burritos, place tortillas on a work surface. Arrange half of hash browns, scrambled eggs, cheese, and chorizo mixture in parallel strips across center of each tortilla, leaving a 1\" border on left and right sides. Spoon half of green chiles over each. Fold in sides of tortillas and roll up tightly.Step 8Place burritos, seam side down, in pan. Cook over medium-high heat until sealed and light golden brown, about 2 minutes. Turn over and cook until light golden brown on other side.How would you rate New Mexican\u2013Style Breakfast Burritos?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (16)Back to TopTriangle*hash browns, not \u201chash\u201d and refried beans NOT \u201crefrigerator beans\u201d.

I know that I typed both of those words correctly sorry for the correction.I know that I typed both of those words correctly sorry for the correction.WKathrynBBAlbuquerque, NM2/6/2022Born-and-raised and living in ABQ now I  see nothing fundamentally wrong with chorizo in a breakfast burrito. No, Golden Pride doesn\u2019t offer it as an option, but plenty of other LOCAL places do, so enough with the *well I never!* vapors over chorizo. I do occasionally get a chorizo BB, but my personal favorite (at GP) is #2 carne adovada w/hash, or #7 carne adovada w/refrigerator beans. They have some of the best carne adovada in the city IMO. Back to the recipe review\u2026 Having lived in Dallas (no fresh NM green chile in the 80\u2019s) and Boston (also no fresh NM green chile in the 90\u2019s) there are decent jarred options available to places outside of New Mexico. My go-to is the 505 brand for jarred, but Bueno frozen Autumn Roast is better. We all do the best we can with what we have available. Breakfast burritos are supposed to be a delicious and easy way to have a breakfast on the run. Making breakfast burritos is a pain. That\u2019s why you go to Golden Pride for them! Lucky for those folks in Brooklyn who have a Burqueno to make theirs for them! \ud83d\ude03WKathrynBBAlbuquerque, NM2/6/2022from NM, regularly return for family visits.  I agree with \"wildly entitled\" comment by Orale505.  when you are away from home, needs must when the devil drives.  these are similar to what I used to make for the kitchen staff at the old Casablanca (next to La Fonda in the  '70's - served lunch then nightclub in the evenings) as well as The Haven Restaurant up on Canyon Rd.  bottom line, don't break your arm patting yourself on the back for being able to get fresh fire roasted - just because you live on third base doesn't mean you hit a triple.MowerF15Durham, NC12/22/2021Orale505 - you are right on! The differences of opinion in the comments goes to show the passion Nuevo Mexicanos feel about their BBs. I too love the #11 at GP and since I've gone gluten free, I get it without the tortilla. For those who think you can't get a chorizo BB, I guess you've never been to El Parasol where they make a great BB w/chorizo and diced potatoes instead of hash browns. The only commonality of NM BBs, in my opinion, are eggs and chile.SF505Santa Fe, NM9/27/2021There are some wildly entitled and ignorant comments on here. Not everyone has access to fresh New Mexican chile, most of our country lives outside of New Mexico so of course a jarred option is listed here. And nowhere does it say to fry the burrito that everyone keeps talking about, the last step says to toast it which you should absolutely do to your tortilla at some point!\n\nAs another ABQ native, not a friend's cousin who lived there in college, I can attest that my favorite burrito at Golden Pride is the number 11. and guess what, it DOES have sausage. But were you hoping for a recipe on how to cook two strips of bacon? I'm just happy to see some New Mexican representation here and this burrito looks damn delicious. Orale505Burque9/26/2021My best friend moved to New Mexico more than 40 years ago and I\u2019ve been visiting ever since. Lived there for 7 years while attending UNM and I have never seen a breakfast burrito that looked like this, or was made with chorizo. Not saying it can\u2019t be done, just saying I would argue that this recipe would ever be considered authentic by locals. Some people like Christmas, but usually it\u2019s going to be red OR green. I would never eat this. I\u2019m green all the way!  LolJAGPortland, OR9/26/2021I'm trying to think of a Golden Pride/Frontier Restaurant (same co. but better) burrito that this resembles. At a loss. This seems to be a Christmas (red+green) chimichanga variant. Breakfast burritos are not fried. Potatoes (hash or homefry), chile (red/green) and eggs are the core. Bacon or carne adovada is more common than chorizo. Do try to get fresh NM chiles and roast them instead of getting canned ones.AnonymousABQ9/26/2021I've had breakfast burritos in San Diego and LA.  The SD used hash browns and LA used rice.  Both prevent dripping of watery sauces like Pico de Gallo.Bud9/26/2021The basics of this recipe are fine.  However, as a local, (I am sitting here in my home town of Santa Fe) in my humble opinion, neither potato nor rice should ever be in any kind of burrito.  It is true, it is common to find them included here; but when I get a burrito to go locally, I always ask for no potatoes (or no rice).  If I am ordering in, I will ask for the potatoes on the side if they are indeed hashbrowns.  In a burro, these are pure redundant fillers that double the bad carbo load (I love carbs, but not the dumb kind), needlessly increase the calories and the muffle both the mouth feel of the burrito and the layers of flavor in the eating of it.  Another thing that happens here (or rather doesn't happen) that I don't like, is the burritos are rarely grilled/browned on the outside after they are assembled.  At home, or if I get one to-go and take it home, I in fact char or blacken the sides of my burritos (even if I am going to smother or sauce it); this step adds a distinct layer of flavor and crunch to the experience.  Just my little peeves.  Green chile (hot) is essential; but at home I also add lots of good-for-you ingredients, like pico de gallo, grilled vegetables, chopped spinach or kale and oh! sour cream.RodoSanta Fe, NM9/26/2021First we usually use chicken broth not water in red chile sauce, we NEVER use jarred green chiles\u2026omg! And we very rarely ever see burritos with sausage or chorizo. It isn\u2019t very common and we NEVER fry the tortillas. I have never seen that is ANY place I have every been\u2026..Anonymous9/26/2021Truthfully this recipe is just ok\u2026too salty and we do not fry the tortillas. We used chicken broth usually instead of water for sauce. In my area we don\u2019t use chorizo or sausage in ours very often and we NEVER use jarred green chiles! YIKESAnonymousSanta Fe, NM9/26/2021yes! Hashbrowns and New Mexican Chile. Thanks for repping NM food.AnonymousNM9/24/2021delicious red chile sauce! very authenticavocado galSanta Fe, NM9/24/2021Actually, the non-negotiables are flame roasted green chile and fresh, made from scratch flour tortillas.
