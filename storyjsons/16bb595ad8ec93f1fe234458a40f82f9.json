Loosely inspired by the lactation cookie recipe that got author Jessamine Chan through her first month as a new mom, this version features three key ingredients (a.k.a. galactagogues) reputed to increase milk supply: flaxseed meal, rolled oats, and brewer\u2019s yeast. While brewer\u2019s yeast has a bitter edge on its own, it melds seamlessly into each bite thanks to cinnamon, dark chocolate chips or chunks, shredded coconut, and dried figs.While few medical studies exist to support the claim that eating lactation cookies can increase breast milk supply, there is anecdotal evidence. The protein, B vitamins, iron, and other nutrients in these delicious cookies may improve a nursing mom\u2019s overall well-being, while knowing that she has something satiating to eat whenever hunger strikes can ease her mind. For optimal breast milk production, anecdotal evidence suggests eating one cookie about an hour before breastfeeding or pumping is most effective, 2 to 3 cookies per day.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Whisk flour, brewer\u2019s yeast, flaxseed meal, cinnamon, baking soda, and kosher salt in a medium bowl to combine.Step 2Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar in another medium bowl until combined and creamy, about 1 minute. Add egg and vanilla extract and beat until incorporated and smooth, about 30 seconds. Add dry ingredients and mix on low speed until just combined, about 15 seconds. Add oats, figs, coconut, and 5 oz. chocolate and mix just until evenly distributed. Cover bowl and chill dough 30 minutes.Step 3Using a #16 cookie scoop (about \u00bc cup), portion out cookies and divide between 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 3\" apart. (Do not flatten; cookies will spread as they bake.) Press almonds and remaining 1 oz. chocolate into cookies, dividing evenly; sprinkle with sea salt.Step 4Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and front to back halfway through, until edges are firm and golden brown but centers are still soft, 18\u201322 minutes. Let cookies cool on baking sheets at least 15 minutes before eating.Do ahead: Cookie dough can be made and portioned 3 months ahead; freeze on baking sheets until solid, then tightly wrap. Bake frozen cookies about 2 minutes longer than in recipe. Cookies can be baked 1 week ahead; store in an airtight container at room temperature.How would you rate Lactation Cookies?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (6)Back to TopTriangleThese are delicious and beautiful looking cookies. Can the recipe be doubled?BarbRoanoke, VA3/19/2022I made them for my daughter who loved them, even though the first batch came out too dry (she just crumbled it and added yogurt).  The only change i made was to not preheat the oven until after I put them in the refrigerator.  I now not only cook one batch, I make another batch that she can freeze so that she has a good supply.P CaseySilver Spring MD3/18/2022Why do you preheat the oven before chilling the dough for 30 minutesVanessaAustin, TX3/5/2022My sister just brought home my first nephew after a challenging pregnancy and delivery. Jessamine Chan\u2019s article jumped out at me in the magazine and I was then inspired to try her cookies. This was a hit! My sister loves them (and incidentally saw an increase in milk volume). And the whole family keeps grabbing them! About to make my next batch! The one thing I had to change was sub nutritional yeast for brewers yeast based on availability. Yum yum yum!Jeremy SLafayette, CA2/22/2022I used Solgar brand brewer\u2019s yeast and dried cherries instead of raisins. These cookies tasted totally normal, nothing bitter or weird at all about the flavor. Do they work? Don\u2019t know yet.AD2/18/2022These cookies are AMAZING!! The recipe doesn't state to make sure the butter is room temp, but it sure helps. They actually did boost my supply! I used golden raisins and they were wonderful. Such a complex and delightful cookie! When they get too hard to bite into, crumble them into milk and eat them like granola! Emily B.
