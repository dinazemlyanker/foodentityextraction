This turns every serving into the kind of textural marvel that in traditional lasagna is only really possible around the outer edges but is arguably the best part! The savory spice from cumin seeds and crushed red pepper flakes in the vegetarian sauce means you won\u2019t miss the meat here.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Parmesan, finely grated, plus more for serving18-oz. package shredded low-moisture mozzarellaBasil leaves (for serving)PreparationsauceStep 1Heat oil in a 10\" ovenproof skillet over medium. Cook onion, garlic, and cumin, stirring occasionally, until onion is beginning to brown and soften, about 5 minutes. Add both cans of crushed tomatoes, basil leaves, red pepper flakes, and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is slightly thickened and flavors have melded, about 10 minutes. Stir in \u00bd cup water, then remove from heat.AssemblyStep 2Cook spinach in a medium pot of boiling salted water until wilted, about 30 seconds. Drain and transfer to a large bowl of ice water. Let sit until cool enough to handle. Drain and ring out excess moisture from spinach with your hands. Separate spinach and set aside.Step 3Preheat oven to 425\u00b0. Cook noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally and separating noodles as needed to keep from sticking, until just starting to soften and bend but still firm in the center; about 5 minutes. (They should be firmer than you think they should be, but this will create al dente lasagna layers instead of gummy ones.) Transfer noodles to a large bowl of cold water and let cool. Drain noodles and stack flat on a rimmed baking sheet, separating layers with sheets of parchment or wax paper.Step 4Place zucchini in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet lined with paper towels and salt generously on both sides. Let sit 15 minutes to allow excess moisture to drain.Step 5Process ricotta and milk in a food processor until smooth. (It should be whipped and a bit airy). Add pepper, nutmeg, 1\u00bd tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt, and 4 oz. Parmesan and process 10 seconds. Transfer to a medium bowl and fold in reserved spinach with a rubber spatula.Step 6Using a ladle, transfer all but 1 cup sauce to a medium bowl, (there should be just a thin even layer of sauce left behind).Step 7Take a lasagna sheet and place 1\u20132 slices of zucchini in the center. Scoop 2 (heaping) Tbsp. ricotta mixture on top and spread evenly over noodle. Sprinkle 1 Tbsp. mozzarella on top. Carefully roll up lasagna and sit vertically in skillet with tomato sauce. Repeat with remaining lasagna sheets, zucchini, ricotta mixture, and mozzarella.Step 8Evenly ladle sauce in bowl over rolled pasta, then sprinkle more Parmesan over. Bake lasagna until sauce is bubbling gently around the edges and tops of lasagna rolls are browned and crisp, 35\u201340 minutes. Remove from oven and top with more basil to serve.How would you rate Spicy Skillet Lasagna With Ricotta and Spinach?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (3)Back to TopTriangleJust made this with some slight adjustments: halved the recipe, skipped the zucchini, used frozen spinach, and homemade lasagna noodles. Would definitely make again, loved the heat. E Reid 1/31/2022Yummy flavors, but it says to cut zucchini 1/4\u201d thick, which turned out to be too thick when I made it\u2026zucchini was barely cooked and my two zucchini only yielded 10 slices at this size, which was not enough for the amount of noodles. 1/8\u201d might be better.Jen KGrosse Pointe Woods, MI12/23/2021Looks interesting, but would this work in a dutch oven?CarlToledo11/29/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titLasagnaPasta & NoodlesDinnerVegetarianBakeRoastCast ironTomatoVegetableZucchiniSquashRicottaCheeseRecipes you want to make.
