Okay, but also go here if you love to cook, bake, or buy gifts for someone who does. It\u2019s Narnia for spices and spice blends, run by people obsessed with them. You can\u2019t lose, but you especially can\u2019t lose if you bring us some back-up garlic salt, chorizo spice, the crazy, near-wet Portuguese sea salt, spicy Vietnamese cinnamon, or the summer grilling essential Back of the Yards rub. Cross everyone of your holiday lists for all time by hauling back a truckload of the all-purpose cake spice.THE VIBE IS: kid in a candy shop, but all the candy is cumin-tinged. Apothecary meets perfumerie meets the most epic pantry you\u2019ve ever wandered into\u2014The Spice House is designed for discovery.WORD TO THE WISE: You can get spices in any quantity you dream of\u2014just ask. Don\u2019t limit yourself to tiny glass jars. Because trust us, that garlic salt is going to go fast.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day: Monday to Friday, from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u2014Alex BeggsCourtesy of The Spice HouseWE ALSO LOVESawadaA Japanese coffee import in West Loop barbecue landAvecThe brilliant Chicago restaurant that launched a thousand wood-burning ovensCellar Door ProvisionsChicago\u2019s best bread happens to be in one of our favorite daytime restaurants Explore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
