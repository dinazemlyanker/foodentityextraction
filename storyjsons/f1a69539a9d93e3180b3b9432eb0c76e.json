She had previously worked as a microbiologist for a large dairy company in the capital of San Juan, but after having children, she relocated to the island\u2019s main dairying region, where she says \u201cthere are more cows than people,\u201d to work directly with local farmers.Her clientele were primarily women: small-scale dairy farmers who relied on her lab for testing bacteria and antibiotic levels to qualify their milk for sale to a processing plant. If they couldn\u2019t afford certification, they couldn\u2019t sell milk, and without sales, there was no income. \u201cThe lady farmers owed us a lot of money. They couldn\u2019t afford our services. I couldn\u2019t say \u2018no, I can\u2019t help you.\u2019 I had to think of something to do,\u201d says Otero.So she set to work in her kitchen, pouring her passion for the people and land of Puerto Rico into cheese research and development. Otero modeled her experiments after European classics, like Gruy\u00e8re, Manchego, and Cheddar. She eventually settled on five styles, named for the pastures, barrios, and landmarks where the cows who supply the milk graze: Capaez, Ausubal, Monserrate, Montebello, and Cabachuelas (after the \u201cCabachuelas de Morovis,\u201d a vast network of caves vital to the indigenous people of Puerto Rico).Otero soon distinguished herself as the only cheesemaker on the island specializing in aged cheeses (traditionally Puerto Rico produces young cheeses like queso blanco, while aged cheeses are imported from Europe). She named her burgeoning brand Vaca Negra (Black Cow), after a hybrid breed common in the area: a mix of Holstein (those canonical black and white beasts of American dairying) and a local black bull bred mainly for beef. Otero says these uniquely Puerto Rican vacas negras \u201cgive less milk [than Holsteins] but are better for cheese making.\u201dAlmost from the start, her raw milk aged cheeses, with their clean, terroir-driven flavors, were enthusiastically received. Otero opened a facility where she could sell her products and educate visitors about cheesemaking through tours and tastings. Today, visitors can make their own wheels of cheese, customized with herbs and stamped with their names on the wheel. After two months, they can either return to retrieve their finished cheese or have it shipped to them at home.One of the biggest challenges for Vaca Negra is price: European imports, with their government subsidies and supportive infrastructure retail for less than Otero\u2019s aged cheeses. \u201cMaking cheese in Puerto Rico is just more expensive,\u201d says Otero, who cites the lower milk production of the island\u2019s cows, who produce a little more than half of what the average dairy cow on the mainland produces due to the heat and humidity. \u201cCows are not for the tropics,\u201d laments Otero.Vaca Negra\u2019s cheeses are a natural fit for the moneyed consumers of San Juan, who have access to the cheeses in both retail and restaurants. But the rural locals struggle to afford the cheeses made in their own community. Otero now makes an affordable kefir-style drinkable yogurt, in flavors like pi\u00f1a colada, coconut, and sweet papaya. These have done well with locals and are sold in supermarkets throughout the island, providing an accessible, high-quality, reasonably priced product (about $6 a liter) while providing cash flow for the business.As Vaca Negra settled into its groove as a sustainable, diversified small company, Hurricane Maria struck in late 2017, leaving the facility without electricity for over a month. \u201cWe were spending our days looking for fuel to run the generators,\u201d says Otero, who was able to save the more than 2,000 pounds of cheese she had aging at the time. But in the aftermath, yogurt production ceased immediately. \u201cAt the farm level, our suppliers kept production, but nobody could buy milk. The milk plant couldn\u2019t reach the farms with their tankers. Most dairy farmers were just discarding it,\u201d say Otero. \u201cSome of them gave us milk and as soon as we could turn on machines and we made some cheese. Not as much as I wished, but we made some.\u201dThe physical structures of Vaca Negra were relatively unscathed, and in March 2018, Otero was finally able to reach pre-Maria production levels. Still, life for this cheesemaking pioneer means existing in recovery mode. Just a month later, in mid-April, the entire island once again lost all electrical power.The instability of critical infrastructure remains a challenge for travel and tourism on the island, which supports a vast number of jobs (nearly 7% of Puerto Ricans are directly or indirectly employed by the travel and tourism industry, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council). The industry is recovering post-Maria, but it\u2019s still down nearly 8.5% from last year. \u201cWe need people to buy our cheese online, to visit Vaca Negra, and to talk about our products,\u201d says Otero.  \u201cPuerto Rico needs visitors so our economy can recover. Please, bring all your friends,\u201d she offers, both as a hospitable invitation to learn more about her groundbreaking work, and as a plea for the people, places (and cheese) of the island.Want more cheese content?
