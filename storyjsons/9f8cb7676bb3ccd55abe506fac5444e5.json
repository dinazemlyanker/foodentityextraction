And you don\u2019t need to drop your life savings at the farmers\u2019 market either. (Well, you could.) But Claire Saffitz\u2019s recipe for bucatini with butter-roasted tomato sauce enlists pantry-staple canned tomatoes, roasting them in the oven with anchovies, red pepper flakes, eight garlic cloves, and half a stick of butter to create caramelization and deep tomato flavor. It\u2019s low-maintenance but ultra-comforting, and therefore the only red sauce recipe for me.Like many basic tomato sauces, this recipe begins with canned tomatoes. While it might seem easier to use crushed tomatoes, we prefer to buy whole peeled tomatoes and crush \u2018em ourselves because they often have less additives and break down beautifully into a sauce. I crush in two stages: First a gentle squishing between my fingers before going in the oven, then again after roasting (using a fork) to incorporate the tomatoes with garlic and anchovies.While the sauce is roasting, I get some salted water boiling and secure my preferred pasta. I love bucatini because those long noodles have small holes to soak up as much sauce as possible, but I\u2019ve used spaghetti and rigatoni before too. Before draining, I save \u00bd cup of starchy pasta water to thicken the sauce.Once the garlic is very soft, the tomatoes are jammy, and my kitchen smells delicious, I remove the sauce from the oven and mash with a fork until it looks like coarse applesauce. Then I pour the sauce into the pot with my drained pasta, add pasta water, and toss with tongs until every strand is coated. I like to top with a bit of torn basil because I\u2019m extremely proud of my little windowsill herb garden, but a good amount of Parm and red pepper flakes will do just fine on their own.While I\u2019m sure this recipe would go over great at a dinner party, you don\u2019t need any kind of special occasion to make bucatini with butter-roasted red sauce. In fact, I prefer to make this on quiet weeknights when watching Fleabag is the only thing on my to-do list. After all, who would want to go outside when the whole apartment is filled with the smell of buttery, garlicky tomatoes?Get the recipe:Bucatini with Butter-Roasted Tomato SauceBecause you need more butter-roasted things in your life.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyNever FailPastaRed SauceCanned TomatoesRead MorecookingNo-Cook Puttanesca Is Here To Save Your Very Sweaty SummerBy Rachel KartenRecipes you want to make.
