We think we know better.By Alex BeggsAugust 3, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Keystone View/FPG/Getty ImagesFacebookTwitterEmailCall me Hal ApenyoIn a riveting article this week about Amazon\u2019s grocery delivery dreams, I couldn\u2019t stop going back to a detail about an internal memo written as a fake press release describing the grocery store of the future. It has dry goods in the basement, fresh produce up top, and it\u2019s designed for optimal online delivery. An expert named \u201cHal Apenyo\u201d is quoted. But it sounded kinda boring, robotic. I love grocery shopping, I\u2019m here for a good time and maybe some sausage! What would MY dream grocery store look like?~Insert wobbly daydream graphics here~First, there would be two permanent stands outside the entry (automatic doors, but they squish anyone who walks IN the OUT side): Girl Scouts selling cookies to the left, and a lost Trader Joe\u2019s employee handing out pimiento cheese samples to the right. Inside, all of the produce is organic and cheap as hell. There are ALWAYS Fresno chiles in stock so I can make 80 percent of Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s recipes. In the bakery, somebody\u2019s mama is making warm, all-butter flour tortillas (recruited from H-E-B). At the fish counter, each of the whole fish have candy googly eyes stuck on, because the fishmonger is kooky. The meat doesn\u2019t have a confusing, color-coded sliding scale of sustainability\u2014it\u2019s all coded GREEN because it\u2019s all guaranteed ethically sourced, no games. The soy sauce is in the same aisle as olive oil, vinegar, and mustards, and the rice noodles are next to the spaghetti, because the \u201cethnic\u201d aisle has been banished. For some reason, only Ariana Grande plays on the speakers. The checkout aisles are lined with British tabloids and almond M&M\u2019s and kombucha. And there\u2019s no online delivery option. See you there.Choo chooGet on the pork chop train! God, I love this recipe.Photo by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiPlease explainAndy Baraghani, why is this \u201cthe only salsa you need\u201d? \u201cI didn\u2019t think of YOU when I developed it,\u201d said Andy, \u201cbut YOU will make it. It\u2019s spicy, and you like spicy. And it\u2019s really just putting things on a baking sheet and broiling the f*ck out if them, then pulsing it in a food processor, then seasoning with salt.\u201d It\u2019s charred and has good acidity, he added, and it might convince you to never buy salsa again. From this recipe, you can adjust to your liking, adding more chiles or garlic. \u201cTomatoes are your base,\u201d said Andy. \u201cFrom there, you can replace the actors, swapping Judi Dench for Meryl Streep.\u201dGet the recipe: The Only Salsa You NeedPhoto by Chelsie CraigThe final quinoa loafIs life one cycle of grief followed by another? Yesterday marked our beloved Arcade Bakery\u2019s final day. I wrote about my passion for Arcade\u2019s quinoa loaf mere weeks ago. The majority of my Venmo exchanges with co-workers is paying them back for Arcade sandwiches and baguettes. The universe did a cruel number on owner Roger Gural by seeping rheumatoid arthritis into his joints, making the physical labor of baking bread an act of pain. Mr. Gural, thank you for your hospitality and your perfect croissants, signed, the entire Bon App\u00e9tit staff.Photo by Adam RapoportMeet Sohla!We have a new assistant food editor, Sohla El-Waylly. This week, Sohla was cross-testing Thanksgiving recipes in a Test Kitchen packed with video crew members, lurking employees on the hunt for snacks, and things got a little chaotic. To the tune of the beeping timer hanging around her neck, she told me about the dramatic moment when the bowl of toasted pine nuts in hot oil she was carrying went flying. \u201cI thought I was gonna make it to my station, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d Gaby Melian tossed some salt on the floor and everything was alright in the morning. \u201cRemnants of it will be on my white pants forever,\u201d Sohla said.With guest starRick Martinez was here this week too, making Christmas cookies! How\u2019re you doing, Rick? \u201cPretty tired,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone knocked on my door at 2:30 a.m. last night and invited me skinny-dipping. I didn\u2019t go, but the splashing kept me up.\u201d Welcome to Rick\u2019s Fire Island life. #summerofrickUnnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekWhat began as a discussion of what-does-oat-milk-even-taste-like\u2014Aliza Abarbanel made oatmeal with oat milk per Jesse\u2019s tweet above, and declared it a flavorless miss, \u201cno one wants that\u201d\u2014turned into a digression on ...how many of the BA staff have seen actor Maggie Gyllenhaal at New York restaurants. Aliza saw her in line at Van Leeuwen ice cream in Brooklyn, where Aliza ordered the oat milk ice cream, naturally. Meryl Rothstein remembers spotting Gyllenhaal at Via Carota, while Christa Guerra saw her at Caf\u00e9 Altro Paradiso. Andy Baraghani glimpsed Maggie with her brother Jake at Mett\u0101 in Brooklyn. When Christina Chaey was a waiter, she served Maggie and husband Peter Sarsgaard at Rucola in Brooklyn. Kate Fenoglio saw her at Sweetgreen! Sasha Levine stood behind her in line at Union Market, where she seemed \u201ctotally cool\u201d! Carla Lalli Music wins though, because she \u201csees her a lot\u201d\u2014they live in the same neighborhood.Maybe I\u2019LL see YOU at the Healthyish farmers\u2019 market stand at the Union Square Greenmarket today (Saturday!!!) from 9 a.m. \u2013 2 p.m. I\u2019ll be there bright and early handing out minty limeade, so come say hi!Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecultureTrader Joe\u2019s Oat Milk, and More New Winter Stuff, ReviewedBy Alex BeggscookingHow Interesting That This Tomato Galette Could Serve 8...or 1By Alex BeggscultureCook the Cover!
