Yes, 80. That\u2019s because he\u2019s training for his fifth consecutive New York City Marathon. Which means between pouring you a glass of frizzante skin contact wine and making a new spritz recipe, he\u2019s probably downing water and taking electrolyte pills so he can run 15 miles the next day. So how does someone whose career revolves around wine and alcohol manage to work until midnight then get up the next morning and hit the pavement? Well, for starters, by avoiding the hot dogs during family meal. Here, Anderson talks to us about the five things that help get him through training season. (Yes, natural wine is one of them.) \u2014 Rachel KartenMaurten Energy DrinkI use this sports drink religiously. It is an extremely high carbohydrate drink mix that has been used by nearly all the world's top marathoners including Eliud Kipchoge, who just set the world record, and Mo Farah, who just set the European Record with his win at Chicago. Maurten is unique because it delivers so much carbohydrates but these carbohydrates are encapsulated in pectin, which controls the rate that the nutrients are absorbed by the digestive system. This keeps you from getting stomach cramps or digestive issues. I mix it with some matcha tea powder, and that\u2019s basically my training juice.Kettl MatchaI am a huge proponent of tea\u2014it's one of the healthiest ingredients we can put into our system but I really love the gentle caffeination it provides when I mix it into my Maurten fuel.  Additionally, it has very high levels of theanine, which is one of the few amino acids which can cross the blood-brain barrier and has a great ability to reduce stress and promote a sense of well-being. It\u2019s simultaneously relaxing, but also energizing. As a result, the mind is better suited to keep the body relaxed and performing freely. If you\u2019re stressed out about running 22 miles, your body is going to tense up. Anything you can do to promote a state of relaxation and peacefulness, be it meditation or a tea ingredient, is definitely important.Ashwagandha fresh from Furnace Creek Farm.\nPhoto by Alex LauAshwagandha and ArjunaAshwagandha is the lion of all roots. It is incredibly powerful in its ability to reduce inflammation, lower cortisol (stress) levels and improves brain function and ability to focus. Arjuna, which in Sanskrit means \u201cshining,\u201d is a tree bark that is the ancient herbal hero of the cardiovascular system, increasing the efficiency of heart contractions. When these two ingredients are taken together systematically and regularly, they have been shown to greatly enhance endurance athletes VO2 max and cardio-respiratory performance. When I\u2019m dosing with these, I make a tea with ashwagandha, arjuna, cinnamon, lemon, and honey and drink about two liters of the tea daily. I get my ashwagandha in whole root form from Furnace Creek Farm at the Grand Army Plaza Farmers\u2019 Market. Arjuna is available online from herbalists.Honey ambrosiaHoney ambrosia is basically a mixture of bee pollen, honey, propolis, and royal jelly. And it\u2019s all mixed together into this crazy paste. This stuff is like the fountain of youth. It\u2019s sourced from just outside of NYC, so it has a great effect on your immune system, cardiovascular system, and keeping your lungs healthy.This Ch\u00e2teau de B\u00e9ru C\u00f4te aux Pr\u00eatres is made by Ath\u00e9na\u00efs de B\u00e9ru.\nPhoto by Alex LauBeer and natural wineI drink alcohol very sparingly when I am training heavily. I will have some wine or beer on the weekends, but I don't drink during the week at all. Evil Twin \"Race Day\" is a beer that I designed with my good friend and fellow runner Jeppe Bjarnit-Bjergso of Evil Twin with post-race refreshment in mind. It's a sour IPA brewed with pineapple and aloe-salt, which is a natural full-spectrum electrolyte replacement. Additionally, I designed the label, which is a racing track.Recovery also definitely involves plenty of natural wine the day after Saturday training. I\u2019m tasting wine all day long for work but I don\u2019t actually drink during the week. As a wine director, it's easy to have pick of tons of delicious natural wines, but I tend to favor wines that are fresh, bubbly, and balanced. And made by producers who farm and make their wine transparently\u2014not adding anything or taking anything away. My favorite producers at the moment are: Tom Lubbe of Matassa, Baptiste Cousin, __ Ath\u00e9na\u00efs de B\u00e9ru__, Ren\u00e9 and Agn\u00e8s Mosse, Nacho Gonz\u00e1lez, Env\u00ednate, Christian Tschida, Laurence Manya Krief, Le Coste, Cantina Giardino...this list could probably go for miles.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishNew YorkRead MoreLifestyleThese Are the Supplements Seamus Mullen Swears ByBy Seamus MullenRecipes you want to make.
