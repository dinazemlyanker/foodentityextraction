It\u2019s another to enter a competition. How did I get here?By Peter MeehanJune 4, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Hisashi OkawaFacebookTwitterEmailIf the canopy of stars wasn\u2019t so captivating, wasn\u2019t like silver glitter spilled on velvet the color of midnight, I might have just given up. It was the kind of damp cold that turns your bones to glass\u2014a spell of 40-degree weather rolled in on what should have been a swampy summer night\u2014and we\u2019d been outside since the previous afternoon, on a patch of grass ringed by mountains, huddled around the smoker for warmth.I was cooking in my first barbecue competition, in a small town in the Catskill Mountains, and seeking shelter would have meant letting my buddies down. Other, properly prepared, teams were asleep in their trailers and trucks, shelters festooned with Old Glory or Infowars stickers. So onward toward dawn we shivered, checking the schedule and our prep list and debating when to switch from beer to coffee.It could have been anything, I guess: old cars, ceramics, maybe an interest in flying small planes. Entering middle age, perhaps looking to distract myself from my feelings about how my business partner had shut down the mildly artsy food magazine I edited, I fell into cooking over live fire as a life-filler-upper.I became a guy who was \u201cinto barbecue,\u201d which, for as true as it is, is still somewhat painful to type. Talking Heads had told us that day was coming, when you wake up and ask yourself, Well, how did I get here?For the past few years, my family and I have been getting out of New York City on weekends and during the summer to go to an old bungalow encampment in a hollow pinned between a swamp and a graveyard. It\u2019s our little slice of heaven with trees and a big lawn and other kids for our kids to play with. There are six other families there, and we\u2014whoever\u2019s up from the city on a given night\u2014routinely eat dinner communally, a dozen or twice as many people sitting down. A whole pork shoulder or all the ribs they had at the supermarket can disappear without anyone even contemplating seconds.The big annual party, which predates me, is a Labor Day pig roast, when everybody\u2019s friends and friends of friends cover the lawn in a patchwork of picnic blankets, bring side dishes or desserts, and make sure their kids don\u2019t drown in the pond. Over the course of a few summers, I went from being a willing helper to spearheading off-season discussions about how we\u2019d do next year\u2019s pig. Now I initiate get-togethers that necessitate the cooking of whole animals whenever possible.Because, like anything I\u2019ve ever been into, I need to up the ante every once in a while to get the same kick. It\u2019s one thing to cook competently for your family, and it leads, often, to cooking for friends in grander quantities. It was another thing when all of this led me to enter a barbecue competition.Actually, I would have vaguely committed to it, forgotten about it, missed registration, and gotten on with my life if it were not for Jonathan Hooper. Jonathan is a fellow dad at the upstate place and the property\u2019s founding pitmaster, a guy who is active on Reddit barbecue boards but who has a real job and life. Over the years, as we\u2019ve gotten to know each other, we\u2019ve undertaken a consistent and escalating program of barbecuing bigger animals, or more of the little ones, and the competition felt, in some ways, like a natural next step. We\u2019d been inching toward the cliff\u2019s edge; it was time to jump.Backyard pig roasts are a Labor Day tradition.\nPhoto courtesy of Peter MeehanI wasn\u2019t unafraid. I am insecure about my cooking in a performative sense: I am a writer, not a cook. I have no investment in the value of trophies, diplomas, and their ilk. My interests lie more in regional barbecue\u2014the ribs or shoulder or brisket cooked over wood you get at the place down the road\u2014than in the style practiced at competitions, which is a thing apart.While there are many governing bodies that put on barbecue competitions, the Kansas City Barbeque Society is the big dog. KCBS says it sanctions 500 meets a year, from \u201cbackyard only\u201d competitions, where pros are excluded, to \u201cinvitationals,\u201d which require you to have won a trophy to qualify. Four types of meat go before the judges: pork butt or shoulder, pork ribs, beef brisket, and chicken. The scoring rubric that judges are educated in via a one- day seminar is intended to be region-agnostic\u2014as welcoming of vinegary eastern North Carolina pork as of salt-and-pepper Texas beef\u2014but it is not. Rather, it rewards what\u2019s often called \u201ccompetition style\u201d: a groupthink simulacrum of many styles.Competition barbecue is sweet and saucy. It is pretty in a manicured, post\u2013World War II food-styling fashion\u2014uniform and tidy in a way that most real barbecue isn\u2019t. The aesthetic prescriptions about how the meat should be presented are campy enough that I think John Waters would dig them. (From the rules: \u201cPROHIBITED GARNISHES are lettuce cores, kale stems, and other vegetation, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO endive, red tipped lettuce.\u201d)To summarize the difference between regular regional barbecue styles and KCBS BBQ, I\u2019d draw this comparison: In one you are hosing your mutt off in the driveway; in the other you\u2019re scissoring perfect pom-poms on your purebred\u2019s haunches before trotting him around Westminster.The kind of chicken that wins competition is fashioned from skin-on but boneless thighs, tucked into taut little bundles, the final product lacquered in sauce. Jonathan and I apprenticed ourselves to a bearded YouTube guru named Tom Jackson (a.k.a. Chef Tom) to dial in our chicken and ribs game. And it was following him that we finally assented to some of the more arcane practices of winning barbecue: We removed the skin from the thighs, scraped the subcutaneous fat from its underside, then redraped it on the meat after it had brined for 90 minutes.The quantity of honey Mr. Jackson drizzled over and around his ribs was gratuitous if not something more unseemly. We ignored our own moral compasses and played along. This was what the competition gods wanted, and so we spent a few weeks of the summer gearing up for that kind of cooking.The cynical carpetbagging Yankee egghead reason I cooked at the dog show was so that I could call it a dog show without feeling like someone could snipe at me saying I\u2019d never shown a dog. But just like you don\u2019t stumble into owning a show poodle, I wasn\u2019t cooking in the competition by accident.I found myself wanting to be out there, by the woodpile, by the collection of pits that had grown like the lawn furniture of a nightmare neighbor: the one who starts with one car up on blocks and soon enough is hoarding mounds of unclassifiable trash in his yard. Now my neighbor Jonathan and I are that guy, but for meat cookers.I acknowledge that humanity has collectively been trying to improve on cooking over fire since the first monkeyman\u2019s synapses fired in frustration, asking, Jeez, couldn\u2019t we speed this up a little bit? I know the Instant Pot is the dream that humans dispersed themselves around the globe seeking, not the chance to spend another night tending a fire with a whole dead animal on top of it.But I grew up in the suburbs and have lived in cities ever since, the kind of cities where having space for a grill is unlikely. So now I can watch a fire forever, in a pit, in the woodstove that heats our cabin. My kids roll their eyes when I tell them about the colors in the fire\u2014the whites and the blues and what they mean\u2014but then I see them coloring the fire in their drawings with those pencils, hues I never reached for in my Duraflame youth.I\u2019d buy albums of the fire\u2019s hisses and pops to listen to in my city apartment. The roar of a bonfire? The way its heat pushes you away before you realize the warmth of the day has retreated and there are bats overhead and suddenly you want that sear on your shins, that orange glow turning your cheeks red? Yes, please.I liked that cooking over fire was uncertain. Writing cookbooks, I\u2019d spent years developing a facility with other kinds of cooking that I could be assured would turn out. I know most of what a wok does on a home stove, how a 12-inch nonstick pan heats up, how long it takes to melt onions. But for a few years, I didn\u2019t know how the meat would turn out, how the fire would behave, if we\u2019d be conquering heroes or idiots who\u2019d burned or undercooked dinner. It was fun, which is a dumb and easy word, but an elusive feeling at certain times in your life.The competition was held on a field Honus Wagner is rumored to have played some baseball on in a Catskills mountain town called Fleischmanns. The townsfolk, now mostly Hasidic Jews, eyed us as we drove in, and I noticed we didn\u2019t have the matching T-shirts or gleaming five-figure rigs that many of the other competitors had. We had a rented U-Haul pickup and a rickety but beautiful Texas-style smoker I\u2019d bought off of Austin barbecue godhead Tom Micklethwait.And maybe it was all those weekends full of meat-play, those 3 a.m. wake-ups, all the YouTube video watching and looking at cookbooks, but I found myself caring a little about winning something. Maybe it was not wanting to return home looking like schmucks\u2014or wanting to at least be schmucks who had some hardware to show for it. Maybe it was the fact that I\u2019d never won an award for anything despite being in a business that gives out a lot of medals.When judgment was ready to be meted out\u2014all the deliberations and score calculations happen in private\u2014the competitors gathered in a semicircle in front of a tiny stage as the organizers went through the categories, doling out trophies and cash prizes.We had undercooked our ribs\u2014we pulled them too early, and they weren\u2019t as tender as they should have been\u2014and our decision to dress our pork shoulder in the vinegary eastern North Carolina style was a recipe for losing against the ketchup-y confectionery style more proven to win. (We got buried.) So all was riding on chicken and brisket.I was confronted with pride in creation while sitting there, something I feel congenitally averse to. But our chicken was good. My teammate Mark Ibold deserved to win something. He\u2019s not a barbecue idiot like I am, but he had dutifully and beautifully scraped the underside of the chicken skin clean in the early morning and had done an exceptional job as our lettuce fluffer, creating gorgeous and rules-compliant carpets of greenery to present the meat on.The ribs were a little undercooked and not as tender as we wanted.\nPhoto courtesy of Peter MeehanWe had been educated in the style of Texas barbecue by Micklethwait, one of the finest practitioners of the form, so we imitated his brisket as well as we could, but shellacked the burnt ends with sweet sauce in a way that I could imagine our other Chef Tom, the one from YouTube, revving his Harley for. Teammate Seth Prouty, also a civilian, had meticulously stoked the fire and split wood quietly in the dark as he shepherded the meat toward doneness for more than 12 hours.Royal Hooper, Jonathan\u2019s then 11-year-old son, rounded out the team. He was there for some sort of father-son bonding opportunity, but rather than be pressed into indentured servitude as I\u2019d hoped, Royal succeeded mainly in showing how much better at sleeping he was than the rest of us. When, early in the morning, the event organizers apologetically parked the generator for a mechanical bull right next to our tent\u2014there\u2019s a carnival aspect to some of these competitions, but that all gets under way after the serious cooking has happened\u2014he goosed free rides for himself on it for the rest of the day.We sent Royal up to collect our trophies: third place in chicken, second place in brisket. In a field of 17 competitors, these were victories, and the couple who ran the competition couldn\u2019t have been kinder or more complimentary about our finish when we visited the tent to claim our prize money. They said that placing as we did in our first pro competition was a guarantee we\u2019d be back for more.It wasn\u2019t, which isn\u2019t to say we won\u2019t. There wasn\u2019t a gregarious community of like-minded cooks or the chance to expand our minds tasting other barbecue that is part of the promise of most food get-togethers. The hours sucked and the pay was bad.But we didn\u2019t abjectly fail. We didn\u2019t lose any toes to frostbite. There was a moment of cow-scratching- herself-against-a-fence-post satisfaction in the molten yolk of an egg-and-cheese sandwich that warmed us as dawn broke and another of revelation when a pan of pork scraps, water, and salt transmuted itself, as teammate Mark said it would, into a pan of carnitas, meat snacks to fish out with dirty fingers as the competition drew to a close.It was this: an excuse to gather around the fire, to cook with friends, and to do funny things to meat, possibly for praise. If it wasn\u2019t the best of times, it wasn\u2019t the worst, either.Listen to Peter read his essay on the Bon App\u00e9tit Foodcast:ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Explore Bon App\u00e9titGrillBarbecueRead Morerecipes80 Memorial Day Weekend Grilling RecipesGallery80 SlidesBy Bon App\u00e9titcultureIt\u2019s Barbecue Season, So Your June Horoscope Comes with a BBQ Side for Every SignGallery12 SlidesBy Catherine Urbanrecipes24 Ribs Recipes to Bring Out Your Inner Pitmaster (or Grillmaster)Gallery24 SlidesBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
