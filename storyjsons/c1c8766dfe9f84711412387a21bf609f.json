AnonymousPA1/8/2020This is an outstanding salad!AnonymousLA1/5/2020This salad was nothing less than sensational.  The Asian pear was such a nice counterpoint to the flavor  combo of Tahini, garlic and lemon.  I was lucky to have found a sweet as sugar Asian pear, but am guessing that sweet Fuji apple would work well too. I sliced the pear paper thin, and will do this every time I make this.chefjeff1Sherman Oaks12/3/2019So good and flavorful!Anonymous11/19/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladTahiniCondiments, Sauces & PastesLettuceLeafy GreensVegetableAsian PearFruitFallQuickEasyWeeknight MealsSideGluten-FreeHealthyishDinnerRecipes you want to make.
