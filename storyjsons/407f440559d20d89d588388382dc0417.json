In this case the shaken daiquiri is strained into a chilled coupe over a single large ice cube, which keeps the drink cold and allows its texture to evolve as the ice slowly melts. When making at home, just be sure to use a coupe that\u2019s big enough to hold that ice as well as the drink. White rum is the backbone here and keeps this daiquiri cocktail breezy (Culliton recommends Denizen Aged White). Aged white rum is grassy and bolder than silver rum. Swap in aged dark rum if you prefer a drink with a warmer profile.For a traditional daiquiri recipe, head this way. Or if you just can\u2019t live without a fruity rendition, opt for this version made with a rhubarb sugar syrup, or this strawberry daiquiri made with a tantalizing secret ingredient (it\u2019s salt!).Editor\u2019s note: This recipe was originally published September 2015.IngredientsMakes 1 serving1bar spoon (or 1 teaspoon) superfine sugar1\u00beounces white rum\u00beounce fresh lime juice\u00bdounce simple syrup1limePreparationStep 1Combine sugar, rum, lime juice, and simple syrup in a cocktail shaker; stir until sugar dissolves, about 20 seconds. Fill shaker with ice, cover, and shake vigorously until outside of shaker is very cold, about 20 seconds. Place a large ice cube in a coupe glass; strain cocktail through a Hawthorne strainer or a slotted spoon into glass.Step 2Using a small serrated knife, remove a 1\" strip of peel from lime (some white pith is okay); it should be stiff enough to provide some resistance when bent. Twist over drink to express oils; discard. Garnish with a lime twist.How would you rate Daiquiri, Up-Rocks?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleReally goodChipNashville1/23/2021What is the purpose of using both sugar and simple syrup?
