But keep in mind which type you\u2019re buying.By Carla Lalli MusicJanuary 23, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Michael Graydon and Nikole HerriottFacebookTwitterEmailEvery other Wednesday, Bon App\u00e9tit food editor at large Carla Lalli Music takes over our newsletter with a sleeper-hit recipe from the Test Kitchen vault, a cooking technique she\u2019s really into, or an ingredient she can\u2019t stop thinking about. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Apparently, if it\u2019s January in North America, you have two choices. You can stay home, swear off alcohol, do a cleanse, and go to bed when the sun goes down. Or, you can lean into hibernation, drink whatever and whenever you want, and eat as many lasagnas and root vegetables as humanly possible.But what I want this time of year is not shepherd\u2019s pie, and it\u2019s not a five-day supply of green juice, either. What I want is persimmons.I did not grow up eating persimmons, but I finally got around to tasting a prize specimen a few years ago, and it made my life better. A good persimmon will transport me to a warmer, sweeter place. It is a glowing jewel of delectability in this time of darkness. But before I can enjoy one, I have to remember which one is which.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Persimmons are native to China and grow on trees. We started cultivating them domestically in the mid- to late-1800s, and California is still our main domestic producer. While there are dozens of varieties, you\u2019re most likely to encounter these two types when shopping: Fuyu and Hachiya. Knowing the difference will greatly impact your persimmon enjoyment index. One of them can be eaten when it\u2019s still hard and crunchy. And the other one is so high in tannins that if you bite into it when it\u2019s under ripe, it will suck every ounce of moisture out of your mouth and coat it with an intensely bitter, chalky flavor. I have eaten persimmons, edited recipes about persimmons, and reported about persimmons; I have even had the wrong one and can still remember how hard it was to get that hideous taste out of my mouth. And yet, every single year I have to re-remember which type of persimmon is which. With a little alliteration, I\u2019m hoping we\u2019ll never have to Google it again.Now that (bottom right!) is the color of a perfectly ripe persimmon.\nPhoto by Gentl and Hyers, Food Styling by Susie Theodorou, Prop Styling by Nina LalliThe Fuyu is round and Flat on the bottom, and if you eat it when it\u2019s Firm, it\u2019s Fine. The Hachiya is Heart-shaped and pointy on the bottom, and you Have to Hold off. The Fuyu persimmon will get sweeter as it ripens, but if you don\u2019t have time, you can eat it crunchy, like a sweet pear\u2014or you could go slightly savory and layer it with a mild blue cheese and toasted nuts. Both types are worth trying, but I\u2019ve never gotten the same weak-in-the-knees feeling from eating a Fuyu as I have from a Hachiya, which tastes like a mango, apricot, and sweet peach all in one. The Hachiya, while worth waiting for, is still a parable on patience. I am not a patient person. But every year I go to NYC\u2019s Chinatown and pick up a flat box of Hachiya persimmons when they\u2019re still rock hard. And then I park them on my kitchen counter and I wait. I hate waiting. It\u2019s like waiting for spring. Impossible! It\u2019s like when you know the shortest day has passed and the sun is setting a couple minutes later every few days, but you still have to wait for it to be noticeable. Takes forever. It\u2019s like waiting for your friends to be done with Dry-uary so they\u2019ll stop talking about the fact that they\u2019re not drinking.But the persimmon has to soften, and you have to lean into it. As the Hachiya ripens, the flesh will transform from a rigid mass to a pudding-like parcel. It will eventually feel like a waterbed, with a thin skin encasing a jelly-like ovoid full of spoonable flesh. Happily, this can happen many times over before spring comes\u2014it takes about a week.As you approach the big day, make sure you have some Greek yogurt, some honey, and some pistachios in the house. Swoosh the yogurt on a plate. Pull off the persimmon\u2019s stem (calyx). Use a sharp knife to slice the fruit into wedges and put them on the yogurt. Drizzle the honey over; chop and scatter the nuts on top. Add a pinch of salt (to remind you of how you teared up when the freezing wind was blowing in your face). Or go slightly savory and make a salad of it, layering a Fuyu with a mild blue cheese and toasted nuts. Either way, this fleeting fruit is honestly one of the best things you can have. Spring is coming, persimmons are going. Enjoy this time, it will be behind you soon.Get the recipe:Persimmons with Greek Yogurt and PistachiosThis fleeting jewel of a winter-time fruit will transport you to a warmer, sweeter place.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterPersimmonsRead MorecookingIf Loving Beans Is a Crime, I\u2019m Officially ScrewedBy Carla Lalli MusiccookingMemorize These 3 Words and Eat Well ForeverBy Carla Lalli MusiccookingNever Cut a Squash AgainBy Carla Lalli MusicRecipes you want to make.
