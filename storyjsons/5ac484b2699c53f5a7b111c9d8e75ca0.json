It relies on subtle flavors like tapioca and coconut milk, but it\u2019s still rich, delicious, and hard to stop eating. Bunker\u2019s recipe uses some ingredients that can be harder to find, so we sort of reverse-engineered our own version. There is a lot of coconut in this, between the reduced coconut milk and coconut meat, which creates a really nice richness without using any cream. In fact, this recipe just happens to be vegan.The tapioca isn\u2019t quick cooking, so you need to have a bit of foresight to soak it in advance, but that\u2019s truly the hardest part. Make sure you soak the tapioca and chia seeds separately\u2014if you soak them together the dessert will be too thick.  The next day, reduce the remaining coconut milk with salt and agave, then add the drained tapioca pearls and stir to bring the pudding together.When your base is set, let it cool and stir in your toppings: soaked chia seeds, coconut meat, and pineapple. This recipe calls for white chia seeds, which is really so the pudding looks uniform without any big black speckles. If you can\u2019t find white chia seeds, the black ones will still provide texture: a little subtle pop each time you bite into one. And the pineapple is acidic and a little sharper, but it\u2019s also still pretty sweet. You do have to find fresh coconut\u2014I think that texture really makes the dessert. The flesh is firm and kind of chewy, with a very refreshing flavor that\u2019s also fatty and rich.After adding all those delicious toppings, the pudding just needs to chill until thickened and cold. Just before serving, give it a good stir and top each bowl with mango, shredded coconut, more pineapple, and a drizzle of agave. If you love coconut and tapioca, you will love this. It\u2019s a really refreshing dessert, and so easy to make ahead because it\u2019s served cold. Keep this in your back pocket for the next time you have people over\u2014or when you want a big batch of something sweet for yourself.It's pudding time:Coconut Chia-Tapioca PuddingIf you love the texture of chia pudding, it gets even closer to bubble tea with the addition of tapioca pearls here.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishDessertVeganTapiocaCoconut MilkCoconutMake AheadPuddingHealthy DessertsRead MorecookingThe Simplest Coconut-Chocolate Mousse Just So Happens to Be VeganBy Molly BazRecipes you want to make.
