Which is nice because it\u2019s not too sweet.\u201d\u201cYou made this????\u2019\u201cTART FOR BREAKFAST!!!!!\u201dThese are all real things that my coworkers said to me (no cash incentive!) after I made Claire Saffitz\u2019s new recipe for cranberry linzer tart. In all my years of baking, never have I received so many compliments. And I have to admit, the tart was awesome. The cranberry filling is just sweet enough. And the super-buttery, crumbly walnut crust is what a graham cracker aspires to be. But it wasn\u2019t all rainbows and butter pats. This recipe is a bit of a project, and there are some key lessons I learned when making it. And because I\u2019m the generous type, I\u2019m going to share them with you.First, let\u2019s talk filling. Making the tart-sweet cranberry inside is probably the easiest part of the recipe (and can be done three days ahead!). You simply bring cranberries (I used frozen), sugar, ginger, butter, and salt to a boil. And stir a TON. Like, I didn\u2019t stop stirring because I was so afraid of scorching it. This paid off/counts as a good arm workout. Do it. You then add some lemon zest and store it all in the fridge until you\u2019re ready to assemble le tart.The tart filling is surprisingly easy to make.\nPhoto by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiNext, the dough. Like I mentioned earlier, the crust has a crumbly/graham cracker vibe, so don\u2019t be alarmed if it doesn\u2019t look like your typical pie dough. And, let me tell you, it\u2019s packed with FaLl vIbEs. We\u2019re talking toasted walnuts, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. The best part? It\u2019s a Pulse Crust. Is that a thing? Not sure. But essentially you dump all the ingredients into a food processor and pulse until a dough forms around the blade. Pretty genius. Just, uh, make sure your 14 TABLESPOONS of butter are nice and cold when you put them into the food processor. Mine were on the warmer side and instead of breaking up into \u201cpea-sized pieces,\u201d the butter just sort of melted. Noted for next time. Press half the dough into your tart pan, wrap the rest in plastic wrap and roll into a disk. Chill.Finally, the lattice. Look, I\u2019ll be honest and share with you another thing that a coworker said to me: \u201cYou kind of messed up the lattice. That\u2019s not a real lattice.\u201d Critique courtesy of the one and only Adam Rapoport. But, here\u2019s the thing that Adam forgot: Claire specifically says in the recipe that this is a \u201cweave-what-you-will lattice,\u201d calling out how delicate the dough is and that you won\u2019t be able to over-under-over-under the whole thing. So when you\u2019re rolling out your dough, keep this in mind. It might crack. It might get a little crumbly. It\u2019s going to be okay. Next time I will probably chill my dough a liiiiittle longer, and also care a little less if it cracks in the process of latticing. Because guess what? You cover up all those mistakes with powdered sugar later on! Anyway, brush egg wash on your tart then pop it in the oven for around 45 minutes.Don\u2019t get too hung up on the perfect lattice. You\u2019re covering it with powdered sugar later.\nPhoto by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiAnd the assembly. Here\u2019s a fun trick that Carla Lalli Music taught me about getting the ring off the pan: Set the tart on a bowl that\u2019s smaller than the pan, and then gently pull the ring down. You\u2019ll be left with your tart balancing gracefully on the bowl. Genius! Oh, and if you find that it\u2019s sticking to the ring after coming to room temp, pop it back in the oven for five minutes. This will help heat up the butter in the crust, making it so the ring slides right off. Once that\u2019s done, dust your tart with powdered sugar, taking care to hide every single crack in your crust.Then, of course, you post your beautiful tart on Instagram. Oh yeah, there\u2019s one more comment I left out. \u201cShe is PERFECT,\u201d noted by none other than Claire herself.Get the recipe:Cranberry Linzer TartInside two layers of buttery, crumbly walnut crust hides a tart cranberry filling.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titThanksgivingholiday2018Recipes you want to make.
