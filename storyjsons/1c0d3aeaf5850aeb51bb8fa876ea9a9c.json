Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,We have a \u201cdon\u2019t yuck my yum\u201d policy here at Bon App\u00e9tit, which means we don\u2019t tell people that a thing they love\u2014food or otherwise\u2014is gross. (Though did you see Andy\u2019s face when Brad says \u201cpink peppercorns\u201d?) And nothing would be more of a \u201cyuck\u201d than admitting that I don\u2019t like Thanksgiving, which is why I generally keep my mouth shut around the office this time of year. But this is my newsletter; therefore I\u2019d like to explain my feelings just a little bit.I don\u2019t like celebrating excess\u2014eating, drinking, spending, colonialism\u2014all things that this week has come to represent. I\u2019ve always felt that way (ask my family about the time I refused to come out of my room for dinner), but this year I\u2019m trying to have a better attitude, to do as the Hallmark cards say and focus on the \u201cgiving thanks\u201d part of things.My Virgo nature loves nothing more than an arbitrary challenge, so I decided I\u2019d send three unconventional thank yous out to the universe: no family members, friends, or co-workers (though I love you all), only people who it felt a little awkward to reach out to but who I felt an honest desire to thank.First I emailed the broker who helped me get my apartment last spring. I told him how desperately I\u2019d wanted the place and that I truly think that living there has changed my life. He wrote back, basically acknowledging that I\u2019d been a total mess when we met and saying he was glad he could help.Then I texted an ex-boyfriend from years back, who probably doesn\u2019t even realize it\u2019s Thanksgiving because he\u2019s Canadian, and thanked him for acting like a kid with me well into our twenties, for splurging on motel rooms with jacuzzis, and for very patiently trying to teach me guitar. He hasn\u2019t responded and maybe he never will, and I\u2019m okay with that.I haven\u2019t decided who my third thank you will be, but I\u2019ll let you know when I figure it out. In the meantime, I\u2019m with staff writer Alex Beggs: enough with the turkey burn workouts. Instead I\u2019ll be jamming to jammers, unsubscribing to marketing emails (my annual purge), and awaiting my mother\u2019s instructions with apron strings tied tight.Still need wine? Maybe, dare I say it, some merlot?
