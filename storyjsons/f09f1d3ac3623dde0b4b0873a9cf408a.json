I'm here for our Healthyish Superpowered dinner at Timber Pizza, honoring Simone Jacobson, which is going down tonight!I've been here since Monday, when I did my first-ever Crossfit workout alongside Timber Pizza chef (and seasoned Crossfitter) Daniela Moreira, who handed me my ass (in an encouraging way). Since then I've eaten the best lobster laing of my life at Bad Saint, a to-die-for Japanese fish and rice breakfast courtesy of Spoken English at The Line, and some lamb shoulder from Maydan that I'm still dreaming about. I also biked over to Union Market, where I tried my first and definitely not last falooda (a cold, creamy dessert popular in South Asia) at Jacobson's Burmese grocery/cafe, Toli Moli. And this morning, I finally got to see the National Museum of African American History, which is as incredible as everyone says it is, including chef Jerome Grant's Sweet Home Cafe, where I ate some roasted trout with cornbread and mustard green stuffing. Yeah, I'm full.But it's all fuel for the 10K I'm running this weekend. I've never run a race before, so training was a big experiment. I ran three days a week including a longer run on the weekends, did a day or two of strength training, and cut back on alcohol. I didn't change my diet otherwise but I was hungry more often and got really into these refrigerated protein bars, which actually taste like food and not cement. For race day, I've got my lucky shorts and a good playlist... and some brunch plans for when I'm done.  What's your race day strategy?
