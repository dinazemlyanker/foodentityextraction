So different, in fact, that the store-bought kare-ko has remained a popular pantry staple for decades, cited in recipes without question or embarrassment. Much like Heinz ketchup (or Kagome if you\u2019re Japanese), Kewpie mayonnaise, and Bull-Dog tonkatsu sauce, kare-ko is a commercial product with nostalgic appeal and too many ingredients to easily re-create.Much has been written about the Japanese love of kare-ko and its many applications that deviate from its South Asian origins. A super-savory, not-so-hot mix of spices featuring turmeric, coriander, fenugreek, and, perhaps most prominent, cumin, kare-ko was first offered in Japanese stores at the beginning of the 20th century.\u00a0In her essay on the origin of Japanese curry, the writer and artist Sita Kuratomi Bhaumik explores how a mix of spices known as curry found its way into so many beloved dishes, from \u201ccurried goat in the West Indies, c\u00e0 ri in Vietnam, sauce au curry in France, currywurst in Germany, curry powdered coronation chicken in Britain\u201d to kare in Japan. A stew thickened with commercial blocks of curry-flavored roux (another pantry staple), kare features, at its most basic, onions, carrots, and potatoes and is served on top of a large pile of white rice. It\u2019s a dish so popular and ubiquitous that it\u2019s taken on the name of the spice blend with which it\u2019s flavored.While this stew is perhaps the most well-known dish that showcases Japanese curry powder, it\u2019s far from the only one. In Japan, you\u2019ll find ramen or udon in bowls of thinner kare broth; Hokkaido soup curry, which is topped with chicken and vegetables and not thickened with roux; and even savory deep-fried buns filled with a thick kare-flavored sauce. (Known as kare pan, they\u2019re also a popular children\u2019s cartoon character\u2014the Japanese love for kare runs deep.) All of these kare-flavored dishes are commonly served in Japanese diners and old-school caf\u00e9s with more than a little bit of retro flair.So what kinds of kare-ko are available? While the food industry giant S&B (pronounced \u201cee-su-be\u201d) is the most popular kare-ko available in Japan (both in market share and according to at least one internet ranking), it is not the oldest. That honor belongs to Hachi, which began producing its kare-ko in 1905 (as opposed to 1923 for S&B). They each offer their spice blends in a charmingly retro red can, with labels that list turmeric, coriander, and cumin as their top three ingredients. S&B boasts that its popular red can of kare-ko contains over 30 types of spices and herbs, a tall feat to replicate in a home kitchen. (The S&B oriental curry powder more commonly available abroad contains 17 types.) Not to be outdone, Hachi stresses its longer history and blend of 22 spices.Photograph by Isa ZapataS&B Oriental Curry Powder$9 $8 at AmazonThe choice is yours\u2014the varieties offered by S&B and Hachi aren\u2019t even the entirety of Japanese curry powders available on the market. And that\u2019s not even accounting for the many other spice blends, like Madras curry powder, that would make a delicious\u2014though distinctly non-Japanese\u2014seasoning for any Japanese curry dish.\u00a0Let\u2019s end this by saying that even though freshly ground spice blends are fabulous, commercial kare-ko deserves its place on your shelf. A popular use that will transport you to a Japanese caf\u00e9? Sprinkled into your next batch of fried rice and topped with a thin omelet. I promise you won\u2019t regret it.Get the recipe:Japanese Curry With Winter Squash and MushroomsIf you love instant Japanese curry from a box, a bowl of this soul-warming homemade version packed with seared mushrooms and sweet winter squash will deliver instant nostalgia.View RecipeChihiro Tomioka buys chocolate chip ice cream for the chocolate chips and has written about all things Japanese at Food52.Explore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
