It looks (and tastes) an awful lot like salmon, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s steelhead trout, the sustainable, home-cook-friendly seafood we\u2019re loving right now.Steelhead trout (also known as Oncorhynchus mykiss!!) is a silvery fish with a bright-orange flesh, native to Alaska and the West Coast. As salmon overfishing has become a serious environmental problem, many chefs are turning to steelhead trout, which has emerged as a similar but more sustainable (and usually more affordable) option. And according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch, steelhead trout is one of the healthier types of seafood, with plenty of lean protein and omega-3 fatty acids. (Just make sure you are buying farm-raised steelhead trout, as wild steelhead is a threatened or endangered species, depending on where it\u2019s from.)Chris Morgan, the co-executive chef of Compass Rose and chef at Maydan, one of Bon Appetit's Best New Restaurants in America, started cooking with steelhead trout partly to \u201copen people\u2019s eyes to other options, what with mass farming and issues with overproduction.\u201d To his surprise, he found that steelhead was a lot more interesting to cook with than salmon. \u201cIt\u2019s a mouthfeel thing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s softer.\u201dOther chefs agree. At the Cajun-Creole restaurant Tapalaya in Portland, OR., chef Anh Luu seasons a whole steelhead trout with Cajun spices and blackens it. \u201cIt's easier to cook with because it's not as fatty [as salmon], it cooks a little faster, and it doesn\u2019t break apart,\u201d she says. Michelle Estigoy, the chef of Cultura Comida y Bebida in Carmel By the Sea, prepares her popular steelhead trout dish by marinating the whole fish in avocado leaves, coriander, and chilies, roasting it on an oak board, then finishing it in a smoker. \u201cThe texture is meaty and flaky,\u201d she says. \u201cThe good flaky. Not a fall-apart kind of thing.\u201dSteelhead trout also works well in sushi, says Sterling Ridings, the executive chef of Guild in Austin, because it\u2019s easier than salmon to slice due to the lower fat content. At Compass Rose, Morgan loves to cure steelhead trout with salt, brown sugar, fennel, coriander, and black pepper\u2014the texture is super velvety, he says, and it takes less time to cure than salmon.Even Sweetgreen, the popular salad chain, added roasted steelhead trout to its core menu in 2015 as part of a sustainability initiative to introduce customers to new species of fish. \u201cSteelhead trout is something with an approachable, familiar flavor and texture,\u201d Sweetgreen co-founder Nic Jammet says. \u201cA lot of customers were like, \u2018I actually like this. I didn\u2019t know trout was like this.\u2019\u201dFor home cooks, Morgan says that steelhead trout is one of the most versatile types of fish out there. \u201cYou will see it cured, pickled, cooked with the skin on, smoked,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are a million ways to do it.\u201dAfter hours, Luu will often pan-sear a filet of steelhead trout with butter, garlic, lemon, and parsley. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take long to cook, it\u2019s not so dense, and because it\u2019s like salmon, it can be served a tiny bit medium.\u201d (For this method, Ridlings suggests slightly scoring the skin with a knife to break the connective tissue, so when you drop the fish in the pan, it doesn\u2019t seize up and develops that crispy skin.) Luu adds that steelhead trout can be easily substituted for salmon in most recipes.If you\u2019re a whole-fish kind of person, Jon Lavelle, the executive chef of The Way Back in Denver, recommends dressing your steelhead with olive oil, citrus, and fennel, and sticking it in the oven at a low temperature until tender. The beauty of steelhead, he says, is that it won\u2019t really dry out.BA senior food editor Chris Morocco says that the fish\u2019s leanness lends itself well to slow-roasting to bring out the best texture. Try swapping it for salmon in this recipe for slow-roasted salmon with fennel, citrus, and chiles.The beauty of steelhead trout, aside from its health and sustainability benefits, is that it\u2019s a fish made for crowd-pleasing: It\u2019s milder and less fatty than salmon, it doesn\u2019t have as much of that \u201cfishy\u201d flavor that some people shy away from, and it can be served hot or cold.Most importantly, says Ridlings, steelhead trout \u201cis very forgiving\u201d no matter what preparation you decide to go with: \u201cIt lends itself to myriad cooking techniques, and you don\u2019t have to do much.\u201d And aren\u2019t those the best kinds of ingredients?Sub steelhead for salmon:Slow-Roasted Salmon with Fennel, Citrus, and ChilesDon\u2019t bother trying to divide this fillet into tidy portions. Instead, use a spoon to break it into perfectly imperfect pieces.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titTroutFishSeafoodSustainableHealthyishTrendsRead MoreLifestyleThe Best Way to Buy Sustainable Seafood?
