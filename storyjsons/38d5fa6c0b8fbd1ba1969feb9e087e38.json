Though to make it even more sublime, serve with scallions that have been tossed in olive oil and salt and given a quick char.Francesco TonelliFacebookTwitterEmailMy mother\u2019s life philosophy is best summed up by Tracy Jordan of 30 Rock: \u201cI don\u2019t need a birthday \u2019cause I buy myself all the presents I need. And because of my drinking, they\u2019re often a surprise.\u201dThis admittedly fabulous approach to living life makes it nearly impossible for me, her daughter, to buy her a birthday, Christmas, Valentine\u2019s Day, or Mother\u2019s Day gift she hasn\u2019t already bought for herself.  So my strategy for the last few years has been to give her the one thing she can\u2019t buy: a really, really good homemade meal. It\u2019s the only gift I\u2019ve given her that has been met year after year with raves instead of, \u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201dUsually my sister and I will go home for the weekend and make her some Mother\u2019s Day waffles\u2014which is the one time a year we use the waffle iron\u2014but this year, I\u2019m also going big on dinner because I didn\u2019t get her a birthday gift(!!!) in April, and she hasn\u2019t forgotten. I\u2019m building the whole meal around a couple of great steaks (my mother\u2019s favorite food group), with lots of other veg-heavy dishes that come with plenty of built-in tasks for my prep cook aka Dad\u2014so he doesn\u2019t feel left out, you know? Here\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking:Peden + MunkRadish Yogurt with Pine NutsI tend to immediately check out when I see the words \u201cpine nuts\u201d in a recipe (do I look like I\u2019m made of money tho???). But ever since my dad finished paying off his share of college tuition for me and my sister, he has enthusiastically adopted a way of life he calls \u201cLivin\u2019 Large.\u201d Activities that fall under the purview of Livin\u2019 Large\u2122 include buying literally every nut at Costco, including luXeEe pine nuts, so radish yogurt dip it is! I always want to eat while I prep for dinner, so I\u2019ll put this out with cucumber spears, halved radishes, and Stacy\u2019s pita chips for us to munch on.Michael Graydon & Nikole HerriottLittle Gem Salad with Lemon Cream and HazelnutsThis is a far cry from the Chaey family house salad\u2014chopped romaine hearts, cucumber coins, cherry tomatoes, and Wish-Bone Light Italian Dressing\u2014and that is not a bad thing. Lots of tasks for dad here (washing lettuce, peeling garlic, picking mint, scrubbing carrots lol), but I can already tell I will have to make the dressing in a closet where no one can see me so I don\u2019t have to explain why I\u2019m making a salad with, um, whipped cream.Photo by Stephen Kent Johnson, Food Styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiA Giant SteakThe main event!!!! Okay so I\u2019ve actually never cooked a rib-eye at home before because I\u2019m too scared of effing up aka overcooking expensive meat. My plan is to follow the Test Kitchen\u2019s golden rules (buy great meat, season it with LOTS of salt, bring it to room temperature before cooking) and hope for the best. I\u2019m also going to bring home a cake tester because this restaurant trick for how to check any meat for doneness completely changed the way I cook protein.Asparagus with Lemon, Olive Oil, and PistachiosI\u2019ve been waiting all year for fat spears of purple-tipped local asparagus to show up at the farmers\u2019 market, and last weekend I was finally rewarded with some sweet, sweet stalks. I think most roasted asparagus is kind of lame and not nearly as vibrant as blanched, so I\u2019ll cook these in very well-salted boiling water for 30 seconds to a minute, just until they turn bright green, then dunk them in a salted ice bath (the salt is key to lots of flavor!) Lemon, olive oil, crushed toasted pistachios, flaky sea salt. Done.Photo by Laura Murray, styling by Judy ManciniPotatoes with Fennel and Radish SaladWhile I love a mayonnaise-based potato salad, I think this lighter version topped with lots of shaved crunchy vegetables from Kismet in L.A. is exactly what I want to cut through the richness of a butter-bathed steak. Also, Key Dad Task: scrubbing the potatoes.And for dessert: A pint of H\u00e4agen-Dazs coffee ice cream, which is my mother\u2019s favorite food of all time and beats out any other dessert in her book. Apparently the perfect Mother\u2019s Day gift was hiding in plain sight all along\u2014it was just in the freezer.Steak studies:Explore Bon App\u00e9titSteakMother's DayAsparagusPotato SaladMenusRead Moreculture8 Great Mother\u2019s Day Cookbooks, Recommended by Our Very Own MomsBy The Bon App\u00e9tit Staffculture9 Mother's Day Gifts for Every Kind of MomBy Ashley MasoncultureMother's Day Should Be the Official Start to Grilling SeasonBy Alex DelanyRecipes you want to make.
