Fortunately for you, pork ribs are fairly interchangeable (see: our Best-Ever Barbecued Ribs will work with any variety of rib you come across!).But before we get to swapping one type of rib for another, let\u2019s break down the three pork ribs you\u2019re most likely to find:From top to bottom: St. Louis-style, baby back, spareribs.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Olivia Mack McCoolSpareribsPictured at the bottom, these are the ribs that come from the belly (as in, the underside) of the pig. The rest of the belly meat is cut away, often used to make bacon, pancetta, or other cured pork products, but the spareribs retain a fair amount of porky, succulent meat.St. Louis-style ribsPictured on the top, these are simply spareribs spiffed up\u2014as in, the hard breastbone and chewy cartilage has been removed. Compared to spareribs, St. Louis-style ribs are uniform in shape (a beautiful rectangle!) and a little easier to work with. They\u2019ve got less meat than baby back ribs (we\u2019ll get to those next) but that meat is fattier. And because they\u2019re thinner and flatter, they also brown more evenly.Baby back ribsThese are the small ribs pictured in the middle. But they\u2019re not from baby pigs! I repeat: not from baby pigs. Whereas spare ribs come from the belly area, baby back ribs are taken from around loin, the muscle that runs along the pig\u2019s back on either side of the spine. They\u2019re curvier and shorter than spareribs (hence, the diminutive \u201cbaby\u201d) with lots of lean meat both between and on top of the bones. Because they\u2019re smaller than spare ribs, they\u2019ll take less time to cook. They also come with a higher price tag. (After Andy Baraghani professed his love for fattier, more flavorful St. Louis-style ribs, I asked him why anyone would call for baby back ribs instead: He said it was because they\u2019re \u201cthe chic rib.\u201d Do what you want with that information.)Okay, but what if you can\u2019t find the type of rib that the recipe calls for? Don\u2019t freak: Any of these three varieties of pork ribs will work great. You\u2019ll want to adjust the amount of salt depending on the weight of the racks (figure one teaspoon kosher salt per one pound meat) and keep a close eye on the cook-time: Baby back ribs will cook more quickly, whereas spareribs will need more time to get tender. And if you want to feed the same number of people with baby back instead of St. Louis-style, you\u2019ll likely need to buy twice the number of racks (as is each baby back rack is so much smaller). Since, um, eating fewer ribs isn\u2019t really an option.No matter which type of rib you get your hands on, cook it low and slow for super tender meat and don\u2019t forget a sticky, spicy-sweet glaze.Rib ready:Sticky-Sweet Five-Spice Pork RibsLacquered with a tangy, garlicky hoisin glaze, these ribs are impressive without being burdensome: There's no grilling or marinating\u2014just two hours in the oven followed by a quick broil.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPorkRibRibsRecipes you want to make.
