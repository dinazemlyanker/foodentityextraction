This sesame oat apple crisp fits the bill perfectly. The topping is studded with sesame seeds and rolled oats, giving this crisp a delicious nutty aroma and perfectly chewy texture. It's filled with the season\u2019s best apples and tossed with Swerve (my go-to alternative sweeteners when I want to add flavor without the carbs and calories), warm spices, and lemon juice, creating a marriage of salty and sweet, nutty and delicious.IngredientsFilling6Honeycrisp or Gala apples (about 2 1/2 pounds), peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch slices1/4 cup Brown Swerve3Tbsp.
