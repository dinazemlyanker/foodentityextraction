Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,Some people do closet edits. Others, like editor-at-large Amiel Stanek, do \u201cfreezer edits,\u201d and ever since he told me about this annual ritual, I do them, too. Last weekend, in the interest of cutting down on my grocery store trips as much as possible, I decided to take a peek in the old icebox\u2014and ended up eating out of the freezer for a week straight.Here\u2019s how it worked: I took all the items out of my (very chaotic, shelf-less!!!!) freezer and placed them on my kitchen counter to assess age, value, and potential for future deliciousness. I tossed anything that couldn\u2019t be salvaged (goodbye, half-empty bag of very freezer-burned shrimp, we hardly knew ye); thawed a couple of surprise gems (more on those below); and, most importantly, made a list of all the properly labeled items left in the freezer. That note now lives on my fridge door. I also took a photo of it\u2014an extra-pro Amiel tip\u2014for grocery store reference later.Here, a list of my favorite freezer finds of the week:A raw chicken backOkay, technically this was my roommate Emma\u2019s chicken back. I assume it was leftover from a bird she had spatchcocked to roast for dinner months ago. She\u2019d stashed the back in the freezer, though I\u2019d call her a \u201csomeday stock\u201d-maker. So I gently asked if she had big plans for the chicken back, and when she couldn\u2019t even recall freezing it in the first place, I made a stock. (I didn\u2019t even thaw it first and, guess what, IT WAS FINE.) I used the resulting warm, soothing stock to make, among other things, the highlight of my entire week: a personal-sized version of BA\u2019s Best Chicken and Dumplings topped with crispy chicken skin crumbles, which I made in my very favorite tiny pot that I wrote about this week for the Healthyish Guide to Being Alone.A container of marinated galbiI brought these Korean-style short ribs back with me from the last time I had dinner at my parents\u2019 house. I thawed these in the refrigerator overnight, then broiled them for dinner with a pot of rice and a simple scallion salad bulked up with lots of thinly sliced raw bok choy leaves. If you\u2019re feeling inspired to give a surprise meat gift to future you, a batch of this Basic Bulgogi would freeze very well, too.A package of storebought dumpling wrappersThese keep for months (the date on my homemade date read 9/2, as proof!) and just need a quick thaw in the fridge before you can get folding. Then, once you\u2019ve made a batch of dumplings, you can freeze them in a single layer on a baking sheet until they\u2019re solid, then slip them into a bag for future dinners and emergency snacks. I\u2019ve started playing a game called \u201cWhat\u2019s the weirdest acceptable dumpling I can make with ingredients I already have?\u201d This most recent batch had tofu, shiitake mushrooms, chopped sauerkraut and kimchi, carrots, green garlic (spring!), and ginger. Were they the best dumplings I\u2019ve ever made? No. Did I eat all of them and now find myself in a slight panic that my dumpling stash is gone? Send help\u2014or just more wrappers.I\u2019ve since filled the void in my freezer with a new crop of items: cooked brown rice (for future fried rice), lots of good cod, halibut, and shrimp from Pierless Fish, and a few more quarts of chicken stock (yes, I am making and hoarding chicken stock like it\u2019s the end of times right now). The next time I go to the store, I might try a trick from my friend Anna Hezel, who\u2019s been quickly blanching torn hardy greens like kale in salted boiling water, then squeezing out the excess liquid and storing the (now teeny-tiny) greens in reusable plastic bags in the freezer. It prolongs the life of fresh greens (though no shade to frozen broccoli, ilu) while simultaneously freeing up precious room in the fridge. I\u2019ll let you know how that goes\u2014lord knows I need that fridge space. But that\u2019s a story for another newsletter.Stay home and stay cooking,Christina ChaeyAssociate editorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishWhat's Chaey Cooking?CoronavirusessayRead MoreLifestyleThese Are a Few of My Favorite FatsBy Christina ChaeyRecipes you want to make.
