This recipe can work with any kind of pickling liquid, even the ordinary stuff from a jar of pickles or cornichons (we tested it with a few kinds). If brown rice isn\u2019t your thing, use another grain: Try barley, farro, or freekeh.Ingredients4 servings Sauce6garlic cloves\u2153cup plus 3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil\u00bdcup cilantro leaves with tender stems\u2153cup raw pumpkin seeds (pepitas)\u00bdserrano chile, chopped3Tbsp. fresh lime juice1Tbsp. pumpkin seed oil (optional)Rice and Assembly1\u00bdcups short-grain brown rice12x2\" piece dried kombu (optional)Kosher salt\u00bdcup pickle brine, divided\u00bdcup finely chopped tender herbs (such as cilantro, parsley, dill, and/or tarragon)3Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oilZest and juice of \u00bd lemonFreshly ground black pepperPreparationSauceStep 1Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0.

Cover pan and cook until rice is tender, 30\u201335 minutes (you can also use a rice cooker; follow instructions for correct timing).
