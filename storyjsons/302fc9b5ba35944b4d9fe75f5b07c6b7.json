The food and beverage industry accounted for one in four jobs lost during the pandemic\u2014more than any other sector of the economy. Without additional assistance, tens of thousands of bars and restaurants could shutter, taking up to 7 million jobs with them. That\u2019s the barista who knows our order before we\u2019re awake enough to ask for it, the busser whose smile improves a lousy day, and so many others behind the scenes. And yet, there\u2019s hope. Restaurants have shown creativity and resilience, becoming movie theaters, drive-throughs, grocers. The industry banded together to push the Restaurants Act through Congress, which, if passed, would offer a $120 billion life preserver. Chefs are doing backflips to feed communities in need while also looking to the future. What the industry will look like on the other side is unknown. But if these folks have their way\u2014and if we, the diners, support them\u2014it\u2019ll be smarter, more nimble, and a heck of a lot more egalitarian.\u00a0We\u2019ve been following how the restaurant industry has been coping with the Coronavirus throughout the year. For more reflections from the people on the inside, read our Restaurant Diaries series.\u00a0Illustration by Joana Partyka\u201cWe are an army of millions, and people need to go back to work to feed America.\u201d\u00a0Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, chef and World Central Kitchen founder: \u201cI closed two of my restaurants. Why? Because it was the smart thing to do. I don\u2019t feel defeated; it\u2019s part of life. There\u2019s an old saying, \u2018Success is going from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm.\u2019 We are in for a big fight in the months ahead. Let\u2019s hope the government gives us an injection of capital. We are an army of millions, and those people need to go back to work to feed America. Restaurants have always been a place to break bread, a place to come together. Sometimes it\u2019s not even about the food. It\u2019s about restoring our bodies and our faith in each other and the idea that together we can get through this.\u201dHow World Central Kitchen Helps: WCK\u2019s Restaurants for the People program pays local restaurants to cook for vulnerable communities, which in turn helps keep them afloat in a crisis. WCK has partnered with more than 2,400 establishments during the pandemic to serve those in need.\u201cYou have to adapt or die.\u201d \u00a0Eric Vernon, The Bar-B-Q Shop, Memphis: \u201cWe\u2019re an old-school restaurant. We didn\u2019t \u2018do\u2019 online. I know half of my customers by name. Now you\u2019re telling us we can\u2019t get near \u2019em?! I said, If we don\u2019t go online quickly, we\u2019re going to die. There were nights I\u2019d stay up till 2 a.m. on this computer, trying to figure out everything. It took 30 days, but now people can order food through our website. They don\u2019t understand how much DoorDash and Grubhub charge a restaurant, but those orders helped us stay in business. You have to adapt or die.\u201d\u201cThis is the end of the independent restaurant era.\u201dEdward Lee, 610 Magnolia, Louisville, KY: \u201cThis is the end of the independent restaurant era, and I don\u2019t know any chef in their right mind who feels hopeful right now. We have meal kits; we\u2019re getting heaters. But at the end of the day, I\u2019m on the Titanic, trying to throw out buckets of water to stay afloat. It\u2019s the fluctuations that really hurt us. We rely on predictability for staffing, for inventory. Now we don\u2019t have a clue. Some of it is COVID-related; some of it is protest-related; and some of it related to fears about eating out. Sometimes it\u2019s a viral article on Facebook that affects consumer confidence.\u201dRead more of Edward Lee\u2019s reflections on the future of the industry here \u00bb\u201cRegardless of what\u2019s going on in the world, it doesn\u2019t change my circumstance. I\u2019m a line cook. I still have to make money and provide for my family. I don\u2019t have the luxury of being scared or staying inside and complaining. Fear is a rich man\u2019s game.\u201d \u2014Courtney Poitras, Red Rooster, NYC\u201cThere is pride and honor in this work. To not be able to do it is very difficult.\u201dLouise Palmer, Send Chinatown Love, NYC: \u201cChinese New Year in February is when a lot of Chinatown restaurants started closing due to anti-Asian sentiment from the whole \u2018Kung Flu\u2019 notion. By the time stay-at-home orders went into place, many businesses were already operating at a loss. A lot of them didn\u2019t qualify for the Payroll Protection Program because they\u2019re very analog; it\u2019s hard to quantify things. Or there were language barriers to accessing it. And because they are cash-only, they can\u2019t use systems like Seamless. These mom-and-pop shops keep prices super low to support the affordable housing units and elderly people in the area. They\u2019re feeding the community. For them to close, it\u2019s one less option for someone who doesn\u2019t have a lot of money to eat. For a lot of our merchants there is pride and honor in this work; they want to earn a living. To not be able to do that is very difficult.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re seeing resourcefulness and resilience, and letting go of things we\u2019ve been holding to.\u201dCristina Martinez and Ben Miller, South Philly Barbacoa, Casa Mexico, and People\u2019s Kitchen, Philadelphia: \u201cOur business has really thrived under these circumstances. We\u2019re not like a boutique restaurant with a catered ambience. We\u2019ve always had a good takeout model, and we\u2019ve been able to use our creativity to adapt.Through World Central Kitchen and community partners, our People\u2019s Kitchen has served more than 33,000 meals since March. We\u2019re growing vegetables on 70 plots in South Philly; the produce goes into the free meals. It\u2019s a way for us to engage in local movement building and progressive politics. We\u2019re seeing positive change. We\u2019re seeing unity, resourcefulness, and resilience, and letting go of some of the superfluous things we\u2019ve been holding onto as a society. But the industry is in shambles. Now it\u2019s a question of rebuilding it. We\u2019re fighting for acknowledgment of undocumented workers in ours and connected industries like farming and fishing. We\u2019re hopeful for change but also skeptical. There\u2019s a long way to go.\u201dIllustration by Joana Partyka\u201cThere\u2019s a young energy out there, going \u2018We need to change this.\u2019\u201dFood writer Ruth Reichl: \u201cThe virus exposed all of the underlying problems with the business model, with the way people are employed, with rents, and the whole way that restaurants have been operating in this country for the past five years. The idea that really successful restaurants didn\u2019t have more than a week of wiggle room once the pandemic hit is really damning.We\u2019re going to see an awful lot of independent restaurants close. There\u2019s going to be hand-wringing, followed by a burst of creativity in two or three years, when the rents are cheaper. There\u2019s a young energy out there, looking at the whole landscape, going \u2018We need to change this.\u2019 It\u2019s time, you know? It\u2019s time for the kind of abuse that happened in restaurants to end, including the disparity between what the front and back of the house make. That will all be reconsidered and we will come up with a new American model of how to run a restaurant in an equitable way. That can only be a good thing.\u201d\u201cThis\u2019ll give the industry an edge\u2014like the phoenix that bursts into flames and comes back stronger.\u201dLena Sareini, formerly of Selden Standard, Detroit: \u201cYou know that flaming Elmo GIF? That\u2019s 2020. I was furloughed for three months during the shutdown. When I went back to work, I was running the entire pastry department by myself. I felt so burnt out, I didn\u2019t have time to be creative. So I resigned to give myself a mental health break and focus on what I actually want to do with my career. The unknown is terrifying, but things will go back to normal. This\u2019ll give the industry an edge\u2014like the phoenix that bursts into flames and comes back stronger.\u201d\u201cNo one has given up. There\u2019s a will to win.\u201dChris Kajioka, Senia and Miro Kaimuki, Honolulu: \u201cTourism is a huge, huge thing for Hawaii\u2019s restaurant industry. The state\u2019s reopening date was pushed back three times; 40 percent of people were unemployed. When we finally opened Miro Kaimuki in June, [my customers were] 100 percent local. We started making takeaway bentos inspired by longtime mom-and-pop shops\u2014and selling 1,000 boxes a week. Though we weren\u2019t doing the food we\u2019d originally planned, we\u2019re exposing our food to a wider range of people. You do what you have to do, right?What gives me hope is that no one has given up. Everyone has stayed very positive. There\u2019s a will to win. This is as rock bottom as you can get, but if we can withstand it, I\u2019m hopeful for the future. Restaurants are probably the most resilient industry in the nation.\u201d\u201cThe government said we can only operate at 25 percent capacity. That\u2019s not viable unless you charge four times what you charged before. Maybe the rents, taxes, or price structure need to change. I don\u2019t know, but it ain\u2019t working right now.\u201d \u2014Jonathan Waxman, Barbuto, NYC\u201cWe\u2019re over trying to guess what\u2019s going to happen. We\u2019re putting our heads down and working.\u201dAnn Redding and Matt Danzer, Uncle Boons, Uncle Boons Sister, and Thai Diner, NYC: \u201cThe future was bright. Uncle Boon\u2019s was doing great and we were three weeks into opening our third restaurant, Thai Diner, when we were forced to shut down. Nobody saw it coming. We tried to negotiate with the landlord, because we can\u2019t pay for real estate on a restaurant that isn\u2019t open. But he wanted full rent, plus interest and late fees, and that was that. It also didn\u2019t make sense to do delivery out of three places, so we hunkered down and did it out of one spot. We went from more than 100 employees to, like, eight overnight. That was our worst day ever. Nobody knew what was happening or how long the pandemic would last. Yet here we are now, and uncertainty continues to plague us. We\u2019ve been focusing all of our energy on Thai Diner. We finally got into the rhythm of outdoor dining, but now that winter is approaching, the anxiety is creeping up again. Will people come? Twenty-five percent of our indoor capacity is 18.75 people. It\u2019s not enough to survive. But we\u2019re emotionally over trying to guess what\u2019s going to happen. We\u2019re just putting our heads down and working.\u201dIllustration by Joana Partyka\u201cI\u2019m on Team Burn It Down and Create Something New.\u201d\u00a0Chef Irene Li, Mei Mei, Boston: \u201cRestaurant people are used to throwing themselves at a problem until the problem goes away, but the situation we\u2019re in is not one that can be solved with more hours or work.We were hoping to make 2020 all about employee and guest education. On March 9 we hosted a public event where we shared our profit-and-loss statement from 2019. The bottom line: It\u2019s really hard to run a restaurant. And then it got a lot harder, like, one week later.We voluntarily closed Mei Mei a couple days before the state ordered it. In April we furloughed a number of employees and started doing takeout, groceries, and prepared foods. We launched a donor-funded initiative that delivered 40,000 pounds of groceries to immigrants and undocumented workers, and we started a GoFundMe to raise money for immigrant-owned restaurants.At the end of June, we laid off 60 percent of our staff, knowing that the \u2018normal\u2019 we were hoping to go back to was still pretty far off. It was one of the worst things I\u2019ve ever had to do.Since then we\u2019ve been focusing on virtual classes, takeout, and prepared foods. We\u2019re also looking into creating consumer packaged goods like dumplings.But these are just Band-Aids. Before the pandemic, 30 percent of our revenue was catering\u2014weddings, conferences, offices\u2014and now that\u2019s mostly gone. Even if we were crushing it with takeout, we wouldn\u2019t be near our normal revenue.We\u2019ve been fortunate to access PPP money and to have an Economic Injury Disaster Loan. We\u2019ve received some grants. But we\u2019re only doing about 20 percent of our pre-pandemic revenue. I\u2019m like, \u2018If we\u2019re getting this help and we\u2019re still screwed, what\u2019s happening to people who aren\u2019t able to access these resources?\u2019Some people want to save restaurants and some want to burn down the system. The movement for Black Lives Matter highlighted many of the industry\u2019s structural inequities. I\u2019m on Team Burn It Down and Create Something New. Recently we started selling other companies\u2019 products, like vegan baked goods from Karen Clarke. Sure, I could bake banana bread, but I\u2019d rather support an Afro-Latina-owned business.Many pivots later, it is time for a leap. Whether it\u2019s a grocery, a distributor, or an incubator, I\u2019m letting go of the restaurant incarnation of Mei Mei so the essence of Mei Mei\u2014our values, our commitment to community\u2014can survive.\u201d\u201cAccept that life will throw things at you that aren\u2019t fair.\u201dGregory Gourdet, Kann, Portland, OR: \u201cAcceptance and gratitude are big words for 2020. Accept that life will throw things at you that aren\u2019t fair\u2014but be grateful for what you do have, and keep pushing. I plan on opening my own restaurant next year. It\u2019ll tell the story of my culture\u2014the Haitian-American diaspora\u2014and offer a safe space for all. I want to do my part to help rebuild.\u201dIllustration by Joana Partyka\u201cLet\u2019s talk through ways to use that anger toward something beneficial.\u201dGerard Klass, Soul Bowl, Minneapolis: \u201cThe year started on a high. Our hip-hop brunch launched; we were doing Black History Month events; and we hit sales records in early March. The downward turn happened quickly. Kobe Bryant passed away, then COVID-19 hit. All the restaurants in our food hall closed or furloughed staff within the first 36 hours. We told our amazing all-Black staff we\u2019re going to stick it out and fight with them to stay open.A friend told me to start feeding first responders. But being African American, we already have a large urban community living at or below poverty level. There wasn\u2019t anyone helping them. So we started the Food for Your Soul campaign to sponsor individually packaged meals for the elderly and families with kids. The phones were ringing off the hook. For every dollar we got in, 20 cents went to our staff and 80 cents went toward making meals. Soul food is medicine. And in an intense time like this, it was able to bring healing and comfort.Then George Floyd was murdered.It\u2019s difficult to work in hospitality when you\u2019re grieving. It\u2019s hard to be a leader when all of your staff could be George Floyd. We had the resilience to stay open through COVID but closed after George to let our staff protest and grieve.I told them, it\u2019s okay to be angry. Let\u2019s talk through ways to use that anger toward something beneficial. I reminded my staff that there are still families in this city who need meals. So let\u2019s own that. Not everybody can be on the front lines, marching and picketing. But those workers still need to eat.I\u2019m more protective of my staff now. If there\u2019s any kind of police interaction, I step in because I don\u2019t want anything to get taken out of context. And I lean heavy into faith to give me peace. It\u2019s challenging, but the mission is bigger than me. I\u2019m just doing my length of the journey.\u201d\u201cThe Latinos from the neighborhood have always been behind me. But when the foodies come\u2014that\u2019s when I think, Dang, I\u2019m doing something good. They come in droves, bring their own tables and chairs, and finish everything. If it wasn\u2019t for the influencers, we probably would have folded.\u201d \u2014Walter Soto, El Ruso, Los Angeles\u201cWe\u2019re walking into a buzzsaw, but we have to keep moving.\u201dBJ Lieberman, Chapman\u2019s Eat Market, Columbus, OH: \u201cI definitely have times where I\u2019m like, \u2018What the hell are we doing?\u2019 We\u2019re walking into a buzzsaw, but we have to keep moving. My chefs and managers moved here from out of state; they signed leases. I can\u2019t just be like, \u2018Hey, guys, remember that whole thing we were doing? We\u2019re not doing it anymore.\u2019 If it wasn\u2019t for my staff, I would have delayed our opening. But people need a paycheck. Some staff moved here from out of state; they signed leases. I couldn\u2019t pull the plug. And we\u2019re not gonna survive doing to-go; we have to open indoor dining. How do we keep people safe and stay afloat? We decided a tasting menu was the best way to limit guest-server interaction. We\u2019re at about 20 percent capacity, but still, I\u2019m looking at the tables, thinking they\u2019re too close, even though they\u2019re more than six feet apart.\u201d\u201cWe cannot wait for landlords or politicians. America has to do better.\u201dSarah Kirnon, Miss Ollie\u2019s, Oakland, California: \u201cWe\u2019re serving food again, but we\u2019re not going back to being a regular restaurant. We\u2019re hoping to launch a nonprofit to teach kids in the community about the food industry, foraging, and sustainability. What gives me hope are the conversations I\u2019m having with peers who are like, \u2018We have to do something.\u2019 We cannot wait for landlords or politicians. America has to do better.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titHoliday 2020Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
