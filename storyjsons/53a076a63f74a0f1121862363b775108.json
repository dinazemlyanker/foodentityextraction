After putting in hours of work to prepare an elaborate Thanksgiving feast or celebratory dinner\u2014standing over the stove whisking my way to creamy b\u00e9chamel, wrapping and rolling 200 pieces of lumpia, preparing the components of a multitiered cake\u2014I never had enough energy to clean the counters, scrub the dishes, and sweep the floor. I am not superhuman, but I am sleepy. All those cleaning tasks, I would tell myself, could wait until the next morning, and I\u2019d of course wake up pissed when confronted by my huge mess.I always knew the whole clean-as-you-go thing was a better option, but I never believed being that type of person was in the cards for me\u2014until I got a Roomba i3. These days I rarely cook anything without powering up my robot vacuum first. Whenever I spill a little flour on the floor, I know my Roomba will sweep everything away within minutes. Sometimes I even swipe some chopped nuts or sprinkles off the counter on purpose as a treat for my little robot friend. Name a better strategy for getting a head start on kitchen clean up! I\u2019ll wait.iRobot Roomba i3$400 $349 at Amazon$400 $350 at Bed Bath & BeyondMy Roomba i3 has the highest IQ of any kitchen tool or appliance I own. I turn it on\u2014via the iRobot mobile app\u2014and it instantly gets to work using smart navigation to move across my space in neat, straight lines. Unlike other robo vac models, this one doesn\u2019t roam across the floor in random directions and angles, so you always know where it\u2019s heading next (a big plus if you\u2019re using it in the kitchen while you cook). Equipped with a three-stage cleaning system and a variety of sweepers, the i3 implements powerful lifting and suction action to pick up every crumb, and it even has dirt-detecting sensors that recognize the areas of my home that need the most help so it can give them some extra attention. It\u2019s so smart that it remembers where the most dirt and crumbs accumulate in my apartment\u2014i.e., in front of my oven and around my counters. Annnnd it can tell when it\u2019s cruising over different surfaces, like hardwood or carpet, and adjusts its brushes accordingly. Sometimes I just stare in awe as it makes its way across the kitchen and ponder an inevitable future where intelligent robots become our overlords.Before getting a Roomba I wasn\u2019t sure if robot vacuums were worth it. I even argued against getting one before my boyfriend bought one for us on the low. Now it\u2019s like a part of the family\u2014always around me in the kitchen as I cook. I consider the Roomba i3 the perfect middle ground between our first robot vacuum, the Roomba 675 (a great easy-to-use, entry-level iRobot) and the Roomba S9+ (the most high-tech, most powerful vacuum iRobot offers, which I\u2019d get if I had a bigger apartment). The i3 does an incredible job at keeping the floors crumb-free without any help from me. I still don\u2019t clean the dishes as I go, but sweeping? That\u2019s my new personality.iRobot Roomba 675$300 $182 at Amazon$250 $245 at TargetiRobot Roomba S9+$1,085 at Amazon$1,100 $950 at Bed Bath & BeyondExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureCleaningRecipes you want to make.
