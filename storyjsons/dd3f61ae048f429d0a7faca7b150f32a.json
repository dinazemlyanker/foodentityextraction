RossMarch 20, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Marissa A. RossFacebookTwitterEmailBased on studies I\u2019ve accidentally conducted by talking with strangers about wine, I have noticed a disturbing new trend. Like red and white and ros\u00e9 before it, people have begun to use the color orange to define and judge wines. People seem to either love \u201corange wine\u201d or hate \u201corange wine\u201d but also don\u2019t seem to understand what \u201corange wine\u201d is. They know that it\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201ccool\u201d and apparently  that\u2019s what\u2019s important (I guess?). I had a guy recently tell me he \u201conly drinks orange wine\u201d and would love for me to teach him about \u201corange varieties.\u201d This guy proceeded to laugh in my face when I said that any white-wine grape can be used to make orange wine.I\u2019m not saying you\u2019d ever be that guy, but I also don\u2019t want you to ever be that guy. That guy is the worst. Not only was he rude and wrong, but why in the world would you ever want to only drink one shade of wine?! \u201cOrange\u201d isn\u2019t a type of grape or winemaking technique. It\u2019s a color! And it\u2019s only one color in the vast style, and color spectrum, of skin-contact wines.Skin-contact wines are white wines made like red wines. They ferment with the grape skins, which give wine its color. Depending on how long the juice ferments with the skins\u2014anywhere from a few hours to many months\u2014skin-contact wines can range in color from golden-straw yellow to vibrant amber to Tony the Tiger orange. The time with the skins also gives these wines more red wine characteristics, like bigger body and more tannin, while maintaining the acidity of a white wine. The longer the skins hang with the juice, the bigger and bolder the wine. You can end up with lighter skin-contact wines whose taste is reminiscent of the Jura\u2019s oxidative white wines, with notes of bruised apple all the way to dirty bong water\u2013colored bottles that taste almost like a sour beer.This is why the term \u201corange wine\u201d as a category needs to die. I know, a bold statement coming from a woman who has a section in a published book with her name on it literally titled \u201cOrange Wines.\u201d Trust me, I\u2019d take it back if I could, along with that trip to Tijuana on 'shrooms, but the term \u201corange wine\u201d is limiting you as a wine drinker. It\u2019s locking you into a color, and since skin-contact wines can be made with any white wine grape and use any winemaking technique, orange-hued wines can vary wildly. You may love a bright-orange Trebbiano but find the same colored Pinot Grigio to be overpowering and too tannic. But asking for a \u201cskin-contact wine\u201d opens you up to a world of colors, flavors, and possibilities you may never have otherwise experienced.I know it\u2019s going to be hard breaking the habit. I catch myself still saying \u201corange wine\u201d too, and this is a personal campaign I\u2019ve been soapboxing around for months now. But you can get started by hitting the local wine shop and asking about some of my latest favorite skin-contact bottles.Photo by Marissa A. RossFor People Who Swear They Hate \u201cOrange Wine\u201dClot de l\u2019Origine \u201cl\u2019Original\u201d White Blend, 2015$23, Lou Wine ShopClot de l\u2019Origine\u2019s \u201cl\u2019Original\u201d screams spring in every way. It looks like the late-afternoon sun in March, just barely golden, and smells like a Pinterest-perfect bridal bouquet of white lilies, candied ginger, and sprigs of thyme, tied with an orange-rind bow. \u201cl\u2019Original\u201d starts juicy with layers of spiced cantaloupe and soft apples but finishes dry with lemon zest and limestone minerality. Thirst-quenching but approachable, this blend of 85% Macabeu and 15% Muscat from France\u2019s Languedoc is the perfect entry-level skin-contact wine. Also, it pairs fantastically with pappardelle with kabocha squash cream sauce. Just throwing that out there.Photo by Marissa A. RossFor PARTY PEOPLE!!! [Yelled Like Tag Team\u2019s \u201cWhoomp There It Is\u201d]Sextant \u201cSkin Bull\u201d Aligot\u00e9 P\u00e9tillant Naturel, 2016$27, Domaine LAIf your college drinking years had actually tasted good, they would have tasted like Sextant\u2019s \u201cSkin Bull.\u201d Pale saffron in color, this P\u00e9tillant Naturel from Burgundy smells like a cider with stone fruit, dried papaya, and new carpet in an apartment near campus. Fresh, vibrant, and begging to party, \u201cSkin Bull\u201d has a bready beer taste to it and goes down easier than a 40 of High Life you didn\u2019t pay for. Come for the party, and stay for the bright flavors of pineapple, barely ripe pears, wrists dabbed with rose hip, and zero notes of flavored vodka.Photo by Marissa A. RossFor People Who Need a Vacation But Will Settle for WinePartida Creus \u201cCart Ver\u201d Cartoixa Vermell, 2016$30, Domaine LAPartida Creus\u2019 \u201cCart Ver\u201d is atomic tangerine in color and so delicious it\u2019s trouble. Well integrated with lots of acidity, it smells like an Orange Crush and a strawberry michelada and tastes like strawberry ocean water (that\u2019s right, two variations on a strawberry theme). There\u2019s some nutmeg dusted in there, with rose petals and tangelo. Be careful not to finish the whole bottle yourself (or do, I sure did).Photo by Marissa A. RossFor People Who Usually Choose Beer Over WineDenavolo \u201cDinavolo\u201d Vino Bianco, 2010$34, Lou Wine ShopThe copper-toned \u201cDinavolo\u201d smells like orange rinds withering in the sun on a wet clay tennis court, with splashes of pineapple and mango. It tastes like eating tangerines and kumquats, with sips of a sour raspberry beer (preferably from the Rare Barrel, if I must say so myself). The blend of 25% Malvasia di Candia, 25% Marsanne, 25% Ortugo, and 25% mystery varietals is melodic and fluid but gritty and gripping with a warm and citrusy tannic finish.Photo by Marissa A. RossFor People Who Are Like, \u201cScrew You, I Love Orange Wine!\u201dLa Stoppa \u201cAgeno\u201d Blend 2012$40, Domaine LADespite my agenda to stop using \u201corange\u201d to describe skin contact as a style, there is no other word to describe the color of La Stoppa\u2019s \u201cAgeno.\u201d It is orange, pretty damn close to Nacho Cheese Doritos orange. Fortunately, its color is the only thing that will remind you of Taco Bell\u2019s Fourth Meal. On the nose, this Malvasia di Candia blend from Emilia-Romagna smells like driving into Palm Springs from Highway 111 with the windows down\u2014an intoxicating breeze of squishy peaches, lemon, hot asphalt, and freshly watered lawns.Sipping on \u201cAgeno\u201d tastes similarly warm, with notes of apricot, navel oranges, leather, and sweat you accidentally licked off your own face. It\u2019s bold but with balanced acidity and finishes with sandy tannins that feel just swept off a dune. (Not gonna lie, I love the 2010 vintage of this wine, but I couldn\u2019t track one down. Keep your orange eyes peeled for either!)Once more all together now, repeat after me: SKIN-CONTACT WINES. You\u2019ve got it. Now go drink them.Marissa A. Ross is the author of Wine. All the Time.
