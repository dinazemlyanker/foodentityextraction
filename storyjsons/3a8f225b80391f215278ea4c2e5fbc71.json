Bonus: You can rub elbows with hip Montrealers (members of Arcade Fire own Agrikol) .ORDER THE: Ti punch, a French-Caribbean drink made from Barbancourt rum, lime juice, and freshly pressed cane sugar syrup, all served separately for assembly at the table (with the option of ordering a quarter, half, or full bottle of booze). If you really want to transport yourself to the Caribbean, order the slushie-like Kokonut cocktail and any of the classic dishes, like jerk chicken, whole fried fish, and griot (fried pork cubes).THE VIBE IS: island cool, with steel drums on the speakers and a two-story mural by Haitian-born artist (and former part-owner) Roland Jean. The restaurant occupies the ground level of this small house, so go up the big staircase for the bar, overflowing with shelves of rum bottles and moody vibes.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day 6 p.m. to midnight. No reservations except for large groups.\u2014Claire SaffitzPhoto by Dominique LafondPhoto by Dominique LafondPhoto by Dominique LafondWE ALSO LOVELe MoussoSplurge a little on this innovative tasting-menu-powered restaurant in the Gay VillageDieu du CielChoose your own microbrew adventure in Mile EndLo\u00efcAll roads (and great p\u00e9t-nat) lead to this Saint-Henri wine barExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
