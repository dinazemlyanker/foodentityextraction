Great twist on classic beef rib roast.  Haberno crema is out of this world.  I made extra of the spice rub and think it will go great on a pork loin.JLBWashington, DC12/25/2021The roast is delicious but the horseradish sauce is the star of the show here. The recipe makes for a lot of super fragrant spice rub and the roast gets a really nice bark on it when it's resting in the fridge. With the spice rub on the outside I didn't think the searing step actually added that much, if anything it broke up the bark that formed while resting. Going to try skipping it next time I make it.Sam A12/24/2021I know how to roast beef. It was the sauce I was after. Made it with my home grown fresh Thai peppers rather than a store bought habanero. Delighted with the outcome.RARNorth Idaho12/24/2021Does not make any sense!?!? It says to turn oven on at 375 and than you say to chill roast for 8 hours??? What am I missing?\nI really want to make this tomorrow!\n\nThank youAnonymous12/24/2021So it\u2019s a beautiful recipe with subpar instructions.  Can\u2019t wait to try part(s) or all of it.  Chill, friends.  After everything!!! that\u2019s gone down the past few years, we are still here cooking and feasting with the ones we love. CissyFort Valley, Virginia12/21/2021I think we can all figure out not to preheat for 8 hrs. Come on people!JaneOrlando, FL12/21/2021Yes, the instructions were not the best but the end result was amazing!  The flavors were so rich.  I seared it, put it in the 325 degree oven, (luckily) used a meat thermometer because instructions said it would take 2 hours and mine was perfect at 1 1/2 hr. and was medium rare.  The Habanero Crema was perfect!  I will make this again--knowing what to do.  susan schmitzMadison, WI12/21/2021Whoever wrote this recipe is an idiot. You turned the oven on, but never roasted the meat. Hire someone who can actually cook this recipeDennisPasadena ca.12/17/2021These instructions are poorly edited.  Based on a similar recipe from Epicurious.com for a rib roast with roasted garlic horseradish crust, this should be \"Coarsely grind fennel seeds, garlic powder, caraway seeds, thyme, paprika, and peppercorns in a spice mill or with a mortar and pestle. Place roast on a rimmed baking sheet. Rub with oil and season all over with salt. Sprinkle spice rub over, ensuring all sides of beef are coated. Chill roast, uncovered, 8 hours.\" first.  Then do the searing, roasting (after pre-heating the oven but not for 8 hrs) and resting as instructed.AnonymousMA12/17/2021I'm going to assume that I stand the roast back up after browning. CalvinLos Angeles, CA12/17/2021I look forward to trying the recipe.  Will it work using the \"500\u00b0F for 5 minutes per pound, then turn off the oven and let sit for 90 minutes\" method of cooking?  A lot easier than wrangling around this large chunk of meat in a hot skillet.  Bob AzPhoenix AZ12/17/2021We will definitely try this. We love spice and prime rib. And we can decipher that \u201cpreheat the oven\u2026\u201d should have been in step 3 not 2.  Maybe edit this for the rookies. Thanks for all the inspiring recipes. NildyOmaha, NE12/17/2021I understand the issues with how the recipe is written but we made this last night for a \u201cfriendsmas\u201d dinner and it was phenomenal.  The flavors of the rub, the method of chilling in the fridge for eight hours, and the Crema all made for one of the best rib roast I\u2019ve ever done.  The flavors are very bold.  Perfect for my spice loving friends.Anonymous12/5/2021Yup, something\u2019s not right with this recipe. Pre-heat oven then chill?AnonymousNew Haven, CT12/2/2021Am I reading this right?  Preheat the oven, then CHILL the roast for 8 hours.  So the oven is left on for 8 hours while the roast is in the fridge?  And then I'm assuming you don't need to bring it back to room temp before you sear it?AnonymousRichmond, CA11/28/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titPrime RibRoastChileVegetableDinnerCast ironRecipes you want to make.
