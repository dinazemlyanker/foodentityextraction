Named after chef and owner Akira Kishimoto, this unassuming spot is as friendly as it is serious about its food.ORDER THE: house speciality: oshizushi, impeccable pressed sushi with imaginative flavor pairings. You can\u2019t go wrong with the salmon, served in a jar filled with cherrywood smoke. Then get whatever assorted sashimi is available (flown in straight from Tokyo\u2019s Tsukiji Market), very photogenic oyster shooters, and, if you have time to wait for it, textbook-perfect okonomiyaki.THE VIBE IS: chummy and enthusiastic. Behind the bar, chefs look up to smile at new customers before resuming their laser focus on the tasks before them, while diners of every age eat with wide-eyed enthusiasm. The affordable menu means you\u2019ll likely dine next to one of many regulars, all of whom have their own strategy for snagging one of the endlessly coveted seats.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Wednesday to Sunday, from 5 p.m. to 9:45 p.m. Closed Monday and Tuesday. No reservations, so be prepared to wait a bit or you can call ahead for takeout and make a picnic of it at nearby McSpadden Park.\u2014Lindsay AndersonJyan KishimotoJyan KishimotoWE ALSO LOVEKissa TantoChinatown\u2019s critically acclaimed Italian-Japanese restaurant worth dressing up forFisherman\u2019s TerraceDestination-worthy dim sum in a Chinese-food capital (a.k.a.
