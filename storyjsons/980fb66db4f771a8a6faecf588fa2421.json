It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.A blast from the pastIt was so hot last weekend that to stand still risked my thighs conjoining into one sticky leg, and all I wanted was cold soup. \u201cIsn\u2019t that an oxymoron?\u201d asked Carla Lalli Music. I don\u2019t care! I considered gazpacho. Predictable. Green gazpacho? You have my attention. CHILLED CORN SOUP WITH LOBSTER SALAD? I\u2019m there. This 2013 recipe by Rebecca Jurkevich has a blurry photo from the days our website photo resolutions were low, which didn\u2019t deter me, but made my imagination run wild.I liked how it sounds like a country club prix fixe lunch menu that comes with an icy glass of vodka, plus it\u2019s incredibly easy to make. The corn kernels simmer with onion, garlic, water, and thyme. Ya blend it. Strain it. Chill it. Done. The texture was sooo creamy and smooth. Delicious on its own. Even better with a sunken island of lobster meat tossed with a simple dressing of shallot, dijon, and lemon. (I skipped the celery leaves, more on that later.) Yes it was expensive to buy lump lobster meat, but it was a special occasion! Saturday! Worth every $$$$.Get the recipe: Chilled Corn Soup with Lobster SaladPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Susie Theodorou, prop styling by Aneta FlorczykTurn up the nightshadesI ended up staying inside and cooking a lot that weekend. So I\u2019ll also direct you toward Andy Baraghani\u2019s tomato salad with warm basil dressing, which sounds fancy, but I promise is a cinch. The dressing is garlic and shallot cooked in oil until starting to crisp, then you move it off heat and add as much basil as you can handle (boom, wilted), and a few anchovies that\u2019ll dissolve in the oil. Next time, I\u2019m doubling the dressing because I used the leftovers the next day on tomato salad Round 2 and it was just as good cold. My favorite quality in food right now.Get the recipe: Tomato Salad with Warm Basil DressingAlex LauBut alsoA THIRD THING. Claire\u2019s rice noodle salad with shrimp is RIDICULOUS. I made it two nights this week\u2014swapping leftover slow-cooked cod for the shrimp\u2014because I had to use up that can of coconut milk for the sauce. I highly, highly recommend it.Get the recipe: Rice Noodles with Shrimp and Coconut-Lime DressingWant this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!In the newsI mean, in the wedding announcements\u2014this story, about a romance between a software designer and a professional juggler who \u201cjuggles a knife with a piece of cheese on the end while being held in the air by six people (called \u2018the dinner of death,\u2019 the stunt involves him eating the cheese off the knife).\u201d I have so many questions! What type of cheese? What type of knives\u2014those cute stubby cheese knives? Big sharp machetes? Are there crackers???MeanwhileMini Andy and a Giant Brad were filming something together this week. It requires gallons of oil. I\u2019ll let YOUR imagination go wild this time, because it\u2019s top secret, for now!See ChaeyChristina Chaey made her solo Test Kitchen video debut, cooking a cold buckwheat noodle dish in which you make a sauce out of ice cubes. Cool! I mean, chill. Sort of a theme this week. Also in this video, a bold case for NOT salting your pasta water. Above, Chaey carved the Thanksgiving in July turkey for the entire staff. The hero we deserve!Watch it: Christina Makes Buckwheat NoodlesWhat\u2019s new at Trader Joe\u2019s?All this stuff. But also, a new GT Dave\u2019s kombucha flavor, strawberry lemonade, that\u2019s exclusive to Trader Joe\u2019s. And very pink. We tried it in the office this week and some people found it too sour and candy-like, while Alex Delany, Julia Kramer, and I loved its unabashed sweetness and aggressive lime kick. Sort of reminiscent of strawberry-kiwi Snapple. That\u2019s a little inside info from me to you.Memo from the marketThe fine folks of GrowNYC, which hosts the city\u2019s farmers\u2019 markets, sent me an email with their etiquette additions to this month\u2019s column, including: \u201cDo not try to complete a transaction while on the phone or with headphones on,\u201d and \u201cBe a conscientious photographer and ask for permission from farmers (and shoppers) before taking a pic.\u201d A sign of the times. (Please note: my column is for humor purposes, nothing is legally binding advice, unless your name is Steven!)Some eggsI love this tiny art book of photos of eggs, by Kelsey McClellan and Michelle Maguire. See what\u2019s inside here.Unnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekThere was one ingredient I left out of the chilled corn soup, and that was a garnish of celery leaves. Why would I buy a package of celery only for the leaves? \u201cTHIS IS OUR MILLION-DOLLAR IDEA,\u201d said Molly Baz and Alex Delany in LOUD unison. Celery leaves, sold like herbs among the parsley and chives at the supermarket \u201cwhere they belong.\u201d Delany insists they make a dreamy spritz garnish. Good luck with that, friends. \u201cIf you love celery,\u201d said Carla, \u201cyou\u2019ll love celery leaves.\u201d (Last week she told me, \u201cif you love cake, you\u2019ll love muffins.\u201d) \u201cThey are overused by the media elite,\u201d she added\u2014meaning ... us, I think\u2014\u201cbut I do love them.\u201d\u201cI would never go out of my way to buy them,\u201d said Christina Chaey. \u201cBut some stalks don\u2019t come with leaves and you feel like you failed,\u201d replied Aliza Abarbanel, pointing out how many recipes we have that call for them, like Josh McFadden\u2019s amazing celery, date, and parm salad, and too many recipes to count by Andy Baraghani. \u201cI wish they could be sold on their own,\u201d Andy texted me, wistfully.
