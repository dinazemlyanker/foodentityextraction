When the glass of milk is already poured, that amount of time feels like an eternity. Woe is you!But while it\u2019s extremely tempting to pretend you never read that direction and go along your merry way, this pesky step is a critical investment in the texture and flavor of your finished product. There\u2019s a good reason it\u2019s a part of so many of the best cookie recipes.The primary reason for a brief resting period to redistribute the liquid in the dough. While the dough sits, turning from loose and soft to drier and more scoopable, the flour is hydrating, yielding cookies that will bake and brown more evenly. The sugar also absorbs moisture from the eggs and butter: With less \u201cfree moisture\u201d hanging around, the dough has a higher concentration of sugar, and the higher this percentage, the more likely it is that you\u2019ll get cookies with chewy centers and crispy edges. (When I halved the sugar in one of my favorite recipes, I found that the low-sugar cookies were cakey and doughy, whereas the full-sugar cookies had tender, buttery middles surrounded by a firm, lacy circumference.)These Salty Buckwheat Chocolate Chunk Cookies are a prime example of a recipe where resting matters.\nPhoto by Laura Murray, Food Styling by Susan Spungen\u00a0But it\u2019s not all about the texture: A drier, more concentrated dough also has more pronounced flavor. Let it sit for long enough\u2014the famous Jacques Torres chocolate chip cookie, published in the New York Times, mandates a rest of at least 24 hours and up to 72\u2014and the starches and proteins in the flour begin to break down, leading to more browning and caramelization. All of this means that well-rested cookies will taste richer and more complex.And one more thing! If you\u2019re resting the dough in the fridge as some recipes instruct, you\u2019re multitasking by hydrating the dry ingredients and solidifying the fat. Because cold butter takes longer to melt than room temperature butter, chilled cookies will hold their shape in the oven. When it\u2019s important to stymie the spread\u2014say, for shortbread circles or intricate linzers that you\u2019ve so carefully formed\u2014chilling the dough is mandatory.So while resting the dough means you\u2019re another 30 or 60 minutes (or, if you\u2019re really committed, 72 hours) away from cookies, it also means those cookies will be chewier, gooier, and more delicious.
