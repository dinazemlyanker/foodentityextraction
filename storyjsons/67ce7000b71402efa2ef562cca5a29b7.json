Case in point: Unsalted potato chips. (Just, why?!) But if you do something simple the right way, it\u2019s like the world just makes sense. The folks at The Shop in Portland, Maine, understand this, and absolutely nail it.There are no elaborate seafood stews or grilled whole fish or ambitious desserts at this seafood joint from the crew at Island Creek Oysters in Massachusetts. It sells oysters, caviar, and tinned seafood spreads. That\u2019s it. The oysters, usually local Maine and Massachusetts varieties, are just $1.50 each and come on large trays of ice with the classic fixings: lemon wedges, horseradish, cocktail sauce, and shallot mignonette. The caviar is also produced by Island Creek and best enjoyed on top of said oysters (not to mention very affordable). The tinned fish\u2014smoked mussels, oil-packed tuna, beautiful sardines\u2014is served with slices of sourdough bread, spicy mustard, butter, chives, flaky salt, sauerkraut, pickles, onions, and saltines, and is arranged in such a way that you almost don\u2019t want to disrupt the harmony of the composition. Almost.But then you and your friends dig in. Maybe you order one more, and sip local pilsners and refreshing, light-bodied natural wines while you wait. Then another round of oysters\u2014actually, let\u2019s make that two. Caviar, too. After a few more beers, you\u2019ll look down at your watch (people still wear those, right?) and realize you\u2019ve been sitting in the airy, sun-soaked room for just about all afternoon. Then someone will ask who needs another pilsner. And you\u2019ll give a joyous nod, as you continue living out the best day of your summer. Simple, done the right way.Go there: The ShopExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsPortland MaineSeafoodRead MorerestaurantsForget the Solstice, Only Tandem Bakery\u2019s Loaded Biscuit Tells Me It\u2019s SummerBy Alex DelanyrestaurantsPortland, Maine, Is the 2018 Restaurant City of the YearBy Andrew KnowltonRecipes you want to make.
