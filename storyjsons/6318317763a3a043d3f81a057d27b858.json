See our past recommendations here!With The Vibrant Life, Amanda Haas didn't just write a cookbook. She wrote a wellness road map with tips for strength training, yoga, and even a dash of sex and aging advice. Admittedly, I was skeptical that one book could successfully cover such a wide variety of topics, but the expertly sourced advice and delicious, approachable recipes proved me wrong.For breakfast, I absolutely adore the smoky sweet potato hash with eggs. It\u2019s baked on a sheet pan, so it\u2019s simple to make and easy to clean up, and the paprika packs a serious punch of smoky flavor.  For dinner, my household leans towards vegetable and fish recipes like the coconut ginger sea bass baked in parchment with king trumpet mushrooms and bok choy. But most of all, I find myself reaching for this book before hosting dinner parties to grab a few of Amanda's crowd-pleasing staple recipes. Her mustard vinaigrette pairs perfectly with a simple green bean snap pea salad, and the chicken stock is a great base for soups and gravy.Recently, I\u2019ve been trying to remember to take time for myself, slow down, and listen to my body. Luckily, these rejuvenating recipes allow me to do just that. \u2014Sarah Thomas-Drawbaugh, Healthyish FoodsBuy it: The Vibrant Life: Eat Well, Be Well, $20.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
