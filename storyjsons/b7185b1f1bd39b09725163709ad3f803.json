Over the next few days, we'll be highlighting the products and methods we use in, out, and around the kitchen to get our lives together.In the surest sign yet that I\u2019m becoming an old person, the purchase I\u2019m most excited about right now is profoundly uncool. But some things are more important than being cool, and being able to carry home a 12-pack of LaCroix from the supermarket without hurting my back is one of them. And that\u2019s why I bought a granny cart.I live in New York City, which means I do all my shopping on foot. I am the mule weighted down with every purchase. Before the granny cart, when I\u2019d head to the market each week, I'd keep mental tabs on the weight of groceries as I walked the aisles. It didn\u2019t matter how good the cantaloupes smelled; were they really worth the crick in my neck that would surely form if I bought more than one? It didn\u2019t matter that I could easily go through three big tubs of Greek yogurt in a week (don\u2019t judge)\u2014that was a purchase for someone stronger than me. Canned tomatoes became a luxury. A big dinner party might require two trips.There was the time, on a beautiful summer day, when I decided to walk to a farmers\u2019 market 30 minutes from my house. Just a few minutes into my return trip, my bags became too much to bear. You know those gym classes where they give you one pound weights that you can\u2019t imagine being hard to lift, then 60 reps in you think your arms might fall off? Turns out juicy peak season tomatoes can have the same effect. I called my husband and asked him to meet me, like some damsel in distress.For months, the straps of my tote digging into my shoulders, that spot on my neck announcing itself, I swore I\u2019d swallow my pride and buy a wheeled cart, but I never actually did it. Until one day, for no particular reason, I did. I chose one on the smaller side\u2014I figured an extra-large one would be unnecessarily clunky and I wasn\u2019t planning to lug giant bags of laundry in it. It fits enough groceries for a heavy-duty weekly shop for my household of two (plus a baby who doesn\u2019t yet eat groceries). On occasion, like when I have loads of visitors for the holidays, I supplement with a couple of totes for lighter items.Now when I go to the supermarket, I skip the shopping basket and just load up my own cart as I go. I lay a tote bag on the bottom to prevent little items, like knobs of ginger, from falling through. (I\u2019ve seen some savvy fellow cart rollers lay a cardboard square there, but I don\u2019t love the look\u2014I have granny cart standards.) And then I walk the aisles with the confidence of Iris Apfel. I can buy every last thing I came for. If seltzer\u2019s on sale, I\u2019ll stock up. I can get two weeks\u2019 worth of yogurt at a time! The only limit to how much butternut squash I can buy is how many butternut squash I can eat.My new system isn\u2019t perfect\u2014getting up stairs with a loaded cart isn\u2019t easy (I admit I sometimes still pull that damsel in distress card). And I\u2019m now acutely aware of New York City\u2019s terrible maintenance of cut curbs, as I struggle navigating some street corners with a full cart. But I wouldn\u2019t trade these inconveniences for the burden of shopping bags any day.For urban dwellers without superhuman strength or farmers\u2019 market regulars who want more than their totes can carry, I\u2019m telling you: It\u2019s time to embrace the granny cart. If fanny packs can become cool, why not this?Buy it: Helping Hand Folding Cart, $40 on AmazonGet the biggest butternut at the farmers' market, then make a squash steak:Butternut Squash Steaks with Brown Butter-Sage SauceApplying the classic steakhouse butter-basting technique to slabs of butternut squash turns it into a hearty vegetarian main.View RecipeAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.
