I ended up boiling down to a little over a cup and this was far too thick and hardened into something like rock hard inedible candy. Big bummer.AnonymousBerkeley, CA12/23/2020We enjoyed this! Nice spiced flavor in the syrup, and not too sweet. In fact, I think it could have been sweeter (perhaps we diluted too much with soda). I made a 1/3 batch, and we drank Oban because that was all I had. I would love to try with different scotches, perhaps something more peaty. This would make a lovely before dinner highball.SidneyPhiladelphia, PA12/16/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titCold DrinkDrinks AllCocktailAmericanPomegranateFruitCinnamonHerbs & SpicesGingerScotchAlcohol & Other DrinksEasyDrinksNonalcoholicHealthyishRecipes you want to make.
