This dinner manages to satisfy them all.By Deb PerelmanMarch 18, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Laura Murray, food styling by Rebecca JurkevichFacebookTwitterEmailWelcome back to Picky Eaters\u2019 Club, where Smitten Kitchen\u2019s Deb Perelman reveals what she actually cooks for her two kids.My husband and I have a joke about how much he likes my cooking. \u201cThis is delicious!\u201d he\u2019ll say as he shakes a bottle of Sriracha all over the soup/tacos/omelet/spaghetti I\u2019ve made. I\u2019ve learned not to take it personally, and in fact I\u2019ve joined him, finding that my own spice tolerance has slowly crept up from virtually nonexistent to \u201cWho finished the chili crisp again?!\u201dThen there are the other two people in our family: the Picky Contingent. The older one, never wanting to miss out on the fun, asks for a microscopic dot of hot sauce on his plate at dinner and then immediately washes it down with half a glass of water. Still, this is progress. The four-year-old, also known as the one who recently requested \u201cpasta with nothing on it and nothing near it,\u201d would prefer not even a speck of black pepper in her food. This, of course, poses a challenge to the way I like my food: seasoned to the point where you might actually taste it, no matter how radical this sounds.What\u2019s a cook who refuses to make multiple versions of the same meal to do? The first time I make something, like this asparagus stir-fry that\u2019s loosely inspired by my love for Sichuan dry-fried green beans, I go easy on the heat. Mostly I\u2019m just trying to get everyone to the table. Then, once I\u2019ve (hopefully) convinced everyone that they like this dish\u2014blistered yet snappy asparagus and crispy pork in a robust sauce, how could they not?\u2014I might sneak in an extra spoonful of chili crisp next time, hoping the slight shift won\u2019t be too detectable. We may never get to a place where my husband doesn\u2019t need to \u201cadjust\u201d his plate with hot sauce, but it\u2019s nice to be heading in the right direction.Get the recipe:Pork and Asparagus Stir-FryBlistered yet snappy asparagus and crispy pork in a robust sauce.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPicky Eaters\u2019 ClubAsparagusPorkStir-FryRead MorecookingHow to Get Your Kids to Eat a Giant Tray of VegetablesBy Deb PerelmancookingFor Dinner That Comes Together in No Time, Make Red Bean Soup with Taco FixinsBy Deb PerelmancookingWhen in Doubt, These Hummus Bowls Are the AnswerBy Deb PerelmanLifestyleIn a House of Picky Eaters, These Jarred Sauces Are Always a WinBy Chris MoroccoRecipes you want to make.
