While many recipes call for first wilting fresh spinach, adding rice, and then cooking the two together, using frozen chopped spinach presents a couple of distinct advantages: One, it\u2019s easier (no washing and drying leaves) and two, it lets you rein in the moisture level so you don\u2019t end up with a soggy final product. (Be sure to squeeze that thawed spinach realllly well to expel excess water.)Feel free to switch up your alliums\u2014use an onion or a couple of leeks in place of the scallions, or add in some garlic for good measure\u2014and to halve the dill. (As written, this recipe is for dill lovers ONLY.) To make this a meal, try it topped with crumbled feta, a poached or soft-cooked egg, tomato-cucumber salad, seared fish, and/or fried shallots.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Slice lemon in half; set aside.Step 2Heat 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium.

Let sit until thawed, 5\u201310 minutes. Drain well and transfer to a clean kitchen towel; squeeze hard to expel as much excess moisture as possible. Transfer spinach to a cutting board and run through a couple times with a chef\u2019s knife to finely chop.Step 4Remove pan from heat, uncover, and top rice with spinach. Re-cover and let sit 10 minutes to allow spinach to steam. Using a fork, fluff rice and incorporate spinach. Stir in remaining half of dill and juice from 1 reserved lemon half.

I added feta, substituted leek for some of the scallion, put a poached egg on top and served with sauteed trout.  I'd like to see a bit more flavor - I didn't add all the dill.  Will add more dill.  And will look for more spices or other herbs to enhance flavor.WendyCamden, ME3/11/2022Great weeknight recipe! Added feta at the end and topped it off with a fried egg. Perfect meal. JaneDurham, NC3/8/2022Yum, came out great, pretty similar to what I know from my family. Regarding a previous person\u2019s review- my yiayia DOES make hers with scallions as that\u2019s how she was taught, and now all aunts use frozen spinach in theirs. All of them born and raised in Greece so I\u2019m content with this recipe\u2019s technique and ingredients!TimNew York, NY3/2/2022As someone who has been making spanakorizo for more than sixty years and who learned how to make from others who had been making it fifty years before that, I can recognize this dish but would not call it authentic, no matter if there are many ways to make it.  (1) Greeks use onions, not scallions.  (2) I have never had lemon peel cooked in it, and lemon is always squeezed on it after it is presented to the table.  (3) Frozen spinach, when there are endless bags of wonderful washed spinach in any supermarket (baby or large).\nI hav no objections to changing recipes, but just do not call it what it is not.PanayiNew Haven, CT3/1/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titRiceRice & GrainsSideDinnerVegetarianVeganSimmerGluten-FreeDairy-FreeNut-FreeEasyDillHerbs & SpicesSpinachLeafy GreensVegetableGreekEuropeanRecipes you want to make.
