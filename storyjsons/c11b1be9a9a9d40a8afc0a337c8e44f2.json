He holds no towel, no tongs. He\u2019s reaching into an enormous barrel-shaped smoker verging on 300 degrees with bare hands. One by one he pokes each glistening pork rib, each halved chicken, each slab of salt-and-pepper-rubbed brisket.\u201cMy finger can always tell,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t sink in, it\u2019s not ready.\u201dHere at B\u2019s Cracklin\u2019 BBQ on Atlanta\u2019s west side, Furman cooks meat the old-fashioned way: over split logs of oak and pecan wood burning hot above layers of coals. It\u2019s a breezeless afternoon and the smokehouse is filled with a thick fragrant haze that leaves me sweating in a way some might describe as profuse. But Furman seems unfazed by the heat. Years as a welder have left his hands calloused, nearly immune to burns. He\u2019s tall and lean and serene in a perspiration-free T-shirt bearing the name of his favorite local brewery, Creature Comforts, with tight, waist-length locks swept neatly under a backwards Run the Jewels flat-brim. It\u2019s the same hat he was wearing the day he met Andr\u00e9 3000 at a Whole Foods in Buckhead, waiting in line for the hot bar. \u201cWe was supposed to run into each other,\u201d the notoriously elusive rapper told him. \u201cThis was supposed to happen.\u201d Furman\u2019s that kind of guy: the kind even hip-hop legends feel cosmically destined to meet, the kind who radiates cool even inside a stifling smokehouse on a swampy Atlanta afternoon.With a pair of silver tongs now, Furman grabs a rack of ribs off the smoker and carries it into the restaurant\u2019s narrow kitchen. This one is ready. Tossing it onto a white plastic cutting board, he slices each bone free, clean and quick. Drizzles a bit of his glossy orange sauce on one and chomps down. Gives a little head-shaking laugh of pleasure. \u201cHere you go, I wouldn\u2019t do you like that,\u201d he says, passing me a rib of my own.It\u2019s so good\u2014crackly exterior yielding to juicy butter-soft flesh\u2014I take one bite and drop it on the floor. Goddammit. I\u2019m staring down in horror, debating the professionalism of picking the thing up and eating it anyway, when Furman laughs and hands me another. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t here,\u201d he says, \u201cI probably would\u2019ve picked it up and ate it anyway.\u201d\u201cYeah, That Happened.\u201dThough he\u2019s been a restaurant owner and full-time pitmaster for just four years, Furman, 37, already sits among the greats. Maybe it\u2019s because he swaps out typical commodity pork for whole heritage-breed hogs he raised himself. (\u201cNobody else was doing that,\u201d Furman says, \u201cNot in a barbecue restaurant.\u201d) Maybe it\u2019s his unique Carolina-meets-Georgia style sauce, a sweet and tangy blend of mustard and fresh peaches. (\u201cHe does everything different,\u201d says Nikki Furman, his wife and business partner.)Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that his food is just so damn delicious. Within months of opening his first B\u2019s Cracklin\u2019 BBQ in Savannah in 2014, locals formed lines out the door on Saturdays after Little League to get a taste of Furman\u2019s offerings: chopped brisket, bark black as pitch; crisp smoked chicken; the Carolina\u2019s Finest pulled pork sandwich topped with creamy-tangy slaw. The media came running. The little barbecue shack watched business double, then triple. Then, late one night in June 2015, just a few days after B\u2019s made Southern Living\u2019s coveted list of the South\u2019s Top 50 Barbecue Joints, a soda machine faultily loaded with too much freon exploded. Launched 30 feet away and took the entire right side of the building with it, burning down the rest in a fiery blaze.\u201cYeah, that happened,\u201d Furman says. He shrugs now, but the loss was devastating. The couple had put everything into the restaurant; Nikki had just quit her job as a property manager. \u201cThat was the only income we had,\u201d she recalls. \u201cWe both cried for the first three hours, and then we looked at each other and said, we can\u2019t keep crying about it.\u201dIn the days and weeks that followed, the community rallied around the Furmans, donating supplies, scouting out potential locations, lending moral support. Bryan and Nikki pooled their remaining cash, borrowed money from a brother-in-law, and hustled to find a new spot. By October 2015 they\u2019d opened a brand-new B\u2019s in Savannah. A year after that they opened another in northwest Atlanta. It was rapper Killer Mike from Run the Jewels, a longtime fan of Furman\u2019s \u2019cue, who encouraged the expansion.Today Furman spends most of his time in Atlanta, where he lives just a few blocks from his smokehouse. Trusted staff members in Savannah run that location themselves; he visits when he can to see how things are going. Last year Heinz tapped him to be one of the brand\u2019s \u201cregional pitmaster partners,\u201d making Furman the face of its Carolina Mustard Style BBQ Sauce, a riff on Furman\u2019s signature blend. A third B\u2019s Cracklin\u2019 BBQ is on the way, also in Atlanta, though he can\u2019t disclose the details quite yet.As far as Furman is concerned, this is just the beginning. Eventually he hopes to go national with B's Cracklin' in as many as ten cities. But with one key focus: to have black owners.Ribs getting ready for the smoker.\nPhoto by Peden + Munk\u201cWhat Furman Is Doing Is Revolutionary.\u201dBryan Furman\u2019s story is one of daily grinds, of heading to the smokehouse at 5 a.m. every morning, of stoking the coals, piling the wood, setting the whole hogs on to smoke. There are no deep-pocketed investors, no high-powered PR machines; there is no generational inheritance beyond the passed-down knowledge of raising pigs and cooking food. His is a story of hard work. But it\u2019s also more than that. It\u2019s about ownership, about honoring the black pitmasters who came before him, about recognizing and reclaiming their legacy for the generations that follow.\u201cWhat Bryan is doing is revolutionary,\u201d says food historian Michael W. Twitty, who has written extensively about the roots of American barbecue, which he traces back to enslaved Africans working on Southern plantations and to their West African ancestors. \u201c[E]nslaved men were in many cases the early pitmasters,\u201d he writes in his book, The Cooking Gene, which was recently awarded the James Beard Foundation\u2019s Book of the Year. \u201cTheir stories are mostly gone because they were just considered \u2018the help.\u2019\u201dAs Twitty points out, this pattern continued long past the days of slavery. \u201cIn the South, the black barbecue man worked behind the boss, and the boss owned the restaurant or the tavern or the pit,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they were just out back, doing their thing, living lives of quiet desperation under Jim Crow.\u201dEven today, African Americans are often sidelined from barbecue\u2019s pop culture narrative. David Chang\u2019s Ugly Delicious, a 2018 docuseries dedicated to using \u201cfood as a vehicle to break down cultural barriers and tackle misconceptions,\u201d according to its official Netflix description, featured zero black people in its barbecue episode. There\u2019s only one African American in Kansas City\u2019s national Barbecue Hall of Fame (Henry Perry, the so-called father of Kansas City barbecue), and he\u2019s been dead almost 80 years.\u201cBarbecue is very cultural,\u201d Furman points out. \u201cPeople have been cooking with wood and fire forever. But there\u2019s really one culture that gets all the praise.\u201d He\u2019s referring to the Southern white men who line the walls of the Barbecue Hall of Fame. The kind you\u2019ll find at weekend \u2019cue competitions boasting about how long they smoked their brisket or which regional cooking methods are best.Furman doesn\u2019t do barbecue competitions. \u201cI don\u2019t cook for judges, I cook for people,\u201d reads a giant chalkboard at the front of his Atlanta restaurant. Nor is he married to any one regional style; instead he makes up his own rules. The uncharted territory of Georgia barbecue is his to claim.Furman slices ribs.\nPhoto by Andrew Thomas LeeAnd though his revolution may sound like a whisper, its implications run deep. \u201cHaving a brick-and-mortar place is real power,\u201d Twitty says. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just do a food truck; it\u2019s not enough to be on the side of the road or behind some other place. Having a door, having a logo, having a place you can call your own after 400 years is a really powerful and important gesture of not just making it, but passing it on and inspiring people to go to the next level.\u201dFurman recognizes the importance of visibility. That\u2019s why he\u2019s changing B\u2019s official logo to a picture of his face. \u201cI get tired of people coming here, thinking it\u2019s a white-owned business,\u201d he says. \u201cI want people to know who I am and stop thinking it\u2019s somebody else.\u201d He nods toward the picnic tables on the wooden patio outside where customers are tearing into pulled pork sandwiches and oozy scoops of mac and cheese. \u201cYou would not believe how many times I\u2019ve been out there, and they thought I\u2019m the dishwasher or the cook. And when they realize it\u2019s me, they're like, \u2018Holy shit.\u2019\u201dFurman tends to the smokers.\nPhoto by Andrew Thomas LeeWhen I brought up the marginalization of black pitmasters with Furman\u2019s friend Howard Conyers, a NASA aerospace engineer and fellow South Carolina\u2013born pitmaster currently working on a book about barbecue\u2019s African American history, he pointed to tokenism as an important factor. \u201cOnce mainstream society\u2019s found the one or two people who fit that mold, all the mainstream media keeps going to that person instead of looking for somebody else,\u201d Conyers said. Furman gets this, too, and hopes to change it. He\u2019s serious about sharing the spotlight, about drawing attention to other black cooks worth knowing, about passing his skills down to those who are willing to learn.Take, for example, his collaboration with Erika Council, a local chef and blogger (and granddaughter of famed restaurateur and cookbook author Mildred \u201cMama Dip\u201d Council, who died last month). After meeting at a Black History Month dinner with fellow Atlanta chef Mike Sheats, Furman and Council decided to team up for #BombAssBiscuits, a Saturday breakfast pop-up at B\u2019s that\u2019s become an Atlanta sensation. Furman makes the gravy, and Council uses B\u2019s lard to craft her famous buttermilk biscuits, sometimes stuffed with sticky cinnamon sugar and draped with icing, sometimes snuggled up against fried chicken or topped with homemade apple butter. These days Atlantans plan their weekends around the event, driving across town, lining up, and buying every last biscuit in a matter of hours. \u201cIt\u2019s her show,\u201d Furman says. Eventually, he wants to help her open her own restaurant.Furman takes a break at a recent family barbecue.\nPhoto by Peden + Munk\u201cI Hate That People Call Me a Chef.\u201dUnlike most of today\u2019s big name pitmasters\u2014your Sam Joneses, your Bessinger brothers\u2014Furman wasn\u2019t born into barbecue. He was born into a farm: his grandparents\u2019 farm in rural Cassatt, South Carolina, where sticky childhood summers were spent chasing piglets through mud. Slaughters happened in the wintertime. He witnessed his first kill at five, maybe six years old. \u201cThat\u2019s what I grew up doing.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t weird.\u201dIn this way Furman learned early to associate good food with hard work. \u201cMy mom, she was always in the kitchen, so we never really ate a lot of fast food. Everything was always homemade, homemade, homemade. I used to get mad because my cousins got Hamburger Helper, and I didn\u2019t.\u201d He pauses, laughing. \u201cUntil I got older and bought my own and realized I wasn\u2019t missing nothing.\u201dAt nine, Furman and his parents moved to Charlotte. Furman spent the rest of his school days there, summers visiting his grandparents back in Cassatt. After graduating high school, he got a job driving forklifts for Black & Decker. But \u201cmy dad was always telling us growing up, you need a trade,\u201d he recalls. That\u2019s how the welding started.Furman worked as a welder for big companies like Honda for years, traveling around the region from job to job. The money was good but fleeting; there was no staying power, nothing to pass down. The farm shut down after his grandparents died, and Furman came to a crossroads. \u201cI wanted to be able to leave something for my kids,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the only other passion I knew I had was barbecue.\u201dSo in 2010 when his daughter\u2019s first birthday rolled around, Furman decided to cook a whole pig. \u201cI learned how to cook with just wood and stuff from my dad,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause he said that\u2019s the most important part of barbecue. If you don\u2019t know how to control a fire, you\u2019re not a pitmaster.\u201d Though he\u2019d previously cooked only chicken and ribs, he was able to apply the same lessons to his first whole hog attempt.The results were good; people liked what he could do. In the months that followed, Furman began experimenting with various methods and meats, started catering for friends and coworkers. Every week he tried out something different. And suddenly the idea of barbecuing professionally didn\u2019t seem like such a far-off dream.A full spread at B\u2019s Cracklin\u2019.\nPhoto by Andrew Thomas LeeA turning point came in 2011. Newly laid off from his latest welding gig, sitting in his parents\u2019 kitchen in Charlotte, Furman told his father: \u201cI\u2019m going to open me a barbecue joint. I\u2019m not working for no more welding companies.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going to make your barbecue different?\u201d his father asked.\u201cIt\u2019s going to taste better.\"\u201cNo, what\u2019s going to make your barbecue different? What\u2019s going to make me say, \u2018I\u2019m going to go to B\u2019s and not go to this guy.\u2019 What\u2019s going to set you apart from this guy?\u201dThe answer came a few months later, with an episode of Andrew Zimmern\u2019s Bizarre Foods where chef Sean Brock cooks Ossabaw Island hogs. After watching, Furman ran to his computer and googled \u201cbest tasting hog breeds.\u201d An array of heritage pigs popped up: Berkshire, Red Wattle, Duroc, Tamworth. Then he googled \u201cbarbecue restaurants using heritage breed pigs.\u201d Nothing.\u201cThat was the concept, right there,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I ran back to my mom and dad, and I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019ve got it. I\u2019m going to raise my own heritage-breed pigs, cook all my sides from scratch.\u2019 My dad and my momma looked at me, and they busted out laughing.\u201dBut today that\u2019s exactly what he does, alongside Nikki\u2014who now runs the restaurant\u2019s front of house\u2014and a pig farmer out in Statesboro, Georgia, named Donald Chavers (Furman calls him \u201cThe Hogfather\u201d). Furman takes an active role in the pigs\u2019 life cycle, knows every detail about how they\u2019re raised: what each pound of meat is worth, which breeds produce the best flavors and when.His mother, Almeta Benjamin, makes the sides fresh every day at B\u2019s Atlanta location (his recipes, her generational know-how). Nothing comes from a can or a bag or a box. Instead it\u2019s collard greens cooked low and slow with smoked turkey leg. Hoecake-style cornbread fried golden brown on a griddle and studded with bits of crispy pork skin (hence the \u201ccracklin\u2019\u201d moniker). A coleslaw recipe from Furman\u2019s grandmother, with peaches added for Georgia flavor. And perhaps most notably, a traditional South Carolina\u2013style hash made from whole smoked hogs\u2019 heads and burnt ends (no waste here!) sent through a Hobart grinder and simmered in a giant pot with mustard and ketchup. The result is a creamy stewlike gravy served hot over rice, meant to warm your insides and stick to your bones.\u201cBryan has a South Carolina history but is taking barbecue and doing it his own way,\u201d Conyers says. \u201cMy family used to do barbecue hash. It\u2019s one of those special dishes. To see him put that in a restaurant showed me he understood a lot about where he came from.\u201dNever forgetting where he came from is important to Furman. \u201cI hate that people call me a chef,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I\u2019m not a chef. I can\u2019t make foam. I can\u2019t do all those little...tweezers stuff, I can\u2019t do none of that.\u201d Despite his celebrity friends, his big-name media coverage, his ambitious expansion plans, he\u2019s still the guy you can call if, say, you need to cook an entire cow over an open fire in the middle of the night, or if you\u2019re raising pigs in your suburban backyard but don\u2019t know how to catch them in time for slaughter (both true stories).\u201cOne thing I know about Bryan is, he\u2019ll be there,\u201d Conyers says. \u201cIf he says he\u2019s gonna do it, he\u2019ll do it.\u201dSmoke catching sunlight.\nPhoto by Peden + Munk\u201cEssential Means Known.\u201dThe day after our interview, Furman gives me a call. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking since we talked about how few black-owned barbecue joints are in the spotlight,\u201d he says. He had done some googling and found a list on a site called Travel Noire titled \u201c19 Essential Black-Owned BBQ Restaurants in America.\u201d\u201cEssential means known.\u201d He speaks a little louder, a little faster. \u201cHow could there be only 19 known black-owned barbecue restaurants?\u201d The problem, he says, is that so many have closed down. His newest goal? To reopen them. One by one.With the help of friends like Conyers and Council, Furman\u2019s plan is to travel around the country seeking out closed-down black-owned barbecue restaurants and bringing them back to life. \u201cIf they were doing ribs, I\u2019ll do ribs. If they were doing chicken, I\u2019ll do chicken. Then I\u2019ll hire local people to keep it going. We\u2019ll open a new one every year.\u201dHe pauses a second, muffles the phone, mumbles a few words to someone out of earshot. I can hear the clank of the smoker, a customer\u2019s laughter, the low steady din of the kitchen staff. \u201cAnyway,\u201d he says, voice returning to its typical cadence, soft and low and slow. \u201cGotta get back to it.\u201dNow watch Furman at work:And find all the recipes from Furman\u2019s family barbecue here:1 / 7ChevronChevronSpiked Ginger-Mint LemonadeView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBarbecueGeorgiaChefsRestaurants + TravelRecipes you want to make.
