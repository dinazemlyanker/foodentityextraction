Tossing it should be the last thing you do before sitting down at the table. See more of the $50 dinner party menu here.Ingredients10 servings1medium head of Napa cabbage (about 2\u00bd pounds)1bunch cilantro1bunch dill2limes\u00bccup distilled white vinegarKosher salt, freshly ground pepper\u00bdcup vegetable oilPreparationStep 1Quarter cabbage lengthwise, then slice each quarter crosswise into 1\" pieces (you should have about 10 cups). Transfer to a large bowl. Trim off bottom 3\" of cilantro and pluck out any bad-looking stems; transfer to bowl with cabbage. Pick tender sprigs from dill and add to bowl; discard tough stems. (You should end up with about 3 cups picked herbs total.) Toss cabbage, cilantro, and dill to combine.Step 2Finely grate lime zest into a liquid measuring cup. Halve limes and squeeze juice over, then add vinegar; season with salt and pepper.Step 3Toss salad with lime-vinegar mixture, then add oil and toss again. Season with salt, if needed, and serve immediately.How would you rate Herby Napa Cabbage Salad with Lime?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (1)Back to TopTriangleI wasn't sure what to expect with this salad, but it's really good. It tastes like a tequila shot (salty, bracing, limey), but herby and crunchy and good for you. The note in the $50 dinner party collection says that you can change up the herbs, but don't until you've tried it once, because the cilantro and dill really work great together in my opinion. Will absolutely be making this salad again.
