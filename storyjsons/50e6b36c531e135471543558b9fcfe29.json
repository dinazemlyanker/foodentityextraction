Like, are there actually eggs in that carton? What the heck is \u201cnog\u201d anyway and is it like myrrh? (Answer: No.)\u00a0We\u2019ve got answers to all of your eggnog questions, from how to make it from scratch to the perfect booze to spike it with:Where did eggnog come from?While its exact origin is disputed, eggnog\u2014as the majority of Americans know it\u2014most likely came from Europe centuries ago. Its etymology is unclear, but common theories for the origin of the word \u201cnog\u201d point to both \u201cnoggin,\u201d a type of cup, and \u201cgrog,\u201d a historic term for watered-down rum. English settlers brought the drink with them across the Atlantic to what is now the United States and Canada, where French speakers call the drink \u201clait de poule,\u201d or chicken\u2019s milk. At the same time, egg-and-milk beverages were popping up in other regions throughout the world, and spiking these drinks with booze is far from an American-only tradition.Are there really eggs in eggnog?\u00a0As the saying goes, if you want to make some eggnog, you have to break some eggs. At its core, eggnog is an emulsion of milk and/or cream, sugar, and, yes, eggs. Unlike in an egg cream\u2014a similar old-timey drink that actually gets its name from the foamy, whipped egg white-like texture achieved by mixing seltzer and dairy fat\u2014the \u201cegg\u201d in eggnog is very, very real.So real that our recipe for eggnog calls for a whopping six eggs, which are mixed vigorously with whole milk, heavy cream, and sugar into an extremely indulgent, extra-rich drink that's reminiscent, as Al Culliton once wrote, of \u201cmelted ice cream mixed with booze.\u201d Recipe developer Amiel Stanek adds a full two cups of dark rum to his recipe. Non-alcoholic eggnog is still eggnog, though, so feel free to mix up a liquor-free batch for the whole family to enjoy. Besides, you can always add the booze at the end.In most cases, homemade eggnog will not be cooked or pasteurized before serving\u2014so is it safe? Mostly. Consuming raw eggs isn\u2019t recommended for the elderly, young children, and people with weakened immune systems. For everyone else, while there\u2019s still a risk of foodborne illness, salmonella is actually rarer than you may think. Plus, alcohol is pretty much disinfectant (right? right???),* so if you\u2019re adding rum you\u2019re probably fine?***This writer is not a doctor and this article should not be viewed as medical advice.**Seriously folks, I studied literature, please be careful.Store-bought eggnog still contains eggs, but most are already pasteurized, so even the sickliest Scrooge can likely have a sip. What's more, the FDA only requires products sold as eggnog in the US to contain a paltry minimum of 1 percent egg solid overall. To account for that significantly lower egg content, eggnog in cartons usually contains stabilizers and binders to match the texture of the homemade stuff, which some blame for an \u201cartificial\u201d or more processed taste.How do you make eggnog? What kind of alcohol should I add?\u201cA classic eggnog is just eggs, cream, and sugar,\u201d says H. Joseph Ehrmann, longtime bartender and proprietor of Elixir, San Francisco\u2019s second oldest saloon, \u201cwhich means [that when you add booze,] it\u2019s essentially a flip.\u201d For the uninitiated, flips are a category of cocktail consisting of liquor, sugar, and\u2014most importantly\u2014eggs, that are mixed or shaken vigorously into foamy perfection. Ehrmann\u2019s eggnog recipe is a seasonal favorite at Elixir, where he mixes the drink with a blend of cognac and rum. From there, he likes to add a few warming holiday flavors like nutmeg and cinnamon to spice things up before serving.If you\u2019d like a variation on the classic cocktail, there are a few well-known options out there. You can make a Tom and Jerry, an eggnog-adjacent cocktail that\u2019s served hot, but you should be careful when heating the drink to avoid cooking the eggs. Vegans can experiment with plant-based nogs\u2014Ehrmann has been refining an oat-based recipe for veg-nog that he makes by blending together cashews, almond or oat milk, and whole oats. Our dairy-free Cashew Nut Nog opts for the creamy sweetness of coconut milk, although it maintains the egg whites for optimal foaminess.\u00a0Feel free to get creative with your eggnog, adding a mix of spirits (like mezcal and cr\u00e8me de cacao) and your choice of garnishes (like allspice or cocoa powder). Ehrmann says bourbon and brandy are both great options but he also enjoys experimenting with other liquors. \u201cI used to do an eggnog with a little bit of sherry and a little bit of a\u00f1ejo tequila,\u201d a mixture I like to call \u2018A\u00f1eggnog.\u2019 Sure, maybe it\u2019s not traditional, but what could be more appropriate for a classic holiday cocktail than a groan-worthy dad joke?Explore Bon App\u00e9titcookingHoliday DrinksRecipes you want to make.
