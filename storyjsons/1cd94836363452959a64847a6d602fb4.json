Countdown to Christmas with CHEESE?! Okay, yes! Mini bottles of wine, little jars of jams. NEED! Sold out! What will they think of next? But behind every genius invention are a handful of ideas that never got their chance to shine. These are the advent calendars that never made it to market.Illustration by Jay Daniel WrightWhat\u2019s Inside Aunt Cathy\u2019s Purse Advent CalendarThis calendar counted down the days until Christmas with select offerings from Aunt Cathy\u2019s purple faux croc Brighton Collectible handbag: a hanky that once belonged to Great Grandma Milly, a glow-in-the-dark rosary, pi\u00f1a colada Tic-Tacs, the business card of the Panera manager who owes her a salad, a bottle of Herbalife Cell-U-Loss\u00ae vitamins, a Starbucks gift card down to .45 cents, and a tube of burgundy tinted Burt\u2019s Bees. But the real treasure is on Christmas day: a police-strength pepper spray keychain.Illustration by Jay Daniel WrightThe Hot Soup Advent CalendarWatch out! All month long, these hot soups will scald you with holiday spirit, somehow kept heated by a cheap cardboard box. Look forward to a bowl of split pea, followed by lobster bisque, an extra chunky clam chowder every Friday, and on Christmas morning: a big bowl of bison chili.Illustration by Jay Daniel WrightThe Restaurant Mint Advent CalendarEvery day is a different mint your dad stole from various mid-range restaurants over a span of 14 years of business travels. Pastel buttermints from Ponderosa, chocolate peppermints from Red Lobster, crinkly Lifesavers from Denny\u2019s, spicy cinnamon ones from Ninfa\u2019s, ice blue ones from the Macaroni Grill that closed in 2002, those not-quite Andes mints from Olive Garden, a stray golf ball from Hooters, and on Christmas morning, greet the lord\u2019s birthday with: a half-eaten tin of Altoids and loose change.Illustration by Jay Daniel WrightThe Raisin Advent CalendarWake up, run to your advent calendar, and behold: a single shriveled raisin, every single day until Christmas.Illustration by Jay Daniel WrightThe Expired Food That\u2019s Still Good* Advent Calendar [*Keep Refrigerated]With at least six cups of Yoplait key lime pie, this expired food that\u2019s still good advent calendar promotes a less wasteful food system as much as it tests the biochemical strength of your gut. Tear open one surprise after the next: still painted hard-boiled Easter eggs, takeout lo mein from three weeks ago, half-eaten container of hummus turned to spackle, speckled shredded Parmesan, a salami stub, a few old Babybels, a jar of fuzzy manzanilla olives, and a nearly new jar of Prego alfredo. If you survive until Christmas, look forward to that tuna salad stored in a festive old cottage cheese tub! #Upcycle.Illustration by Jay Daniel WrightThe Tap Water Advent CalendarIt\u2019s local! Try a sip of tap water from half of every state in this limited-edition advent calendar that celebrates Christmas with a cloudy cup of North Dakota rain water. Stir up the flavorful sediment with a Candy Cane for even more festivity [not included].Illustration by Jay Daniel WrightThe Dirty Dishes Advent CalendarUnwrap a new soiled dish that needs washing as we countdown until the birth of Christ: pint glasses with dried bubbles of beer on the side, oily popcorn bowls, mystery meat speckled cast iron pans, box graters with hardened cheese, a bloody knife, a mixing bowl with cemented flour, and on Christmas: a salad spinner with tiny shards of kale in the panes.You know what would make a pretty great holiday gift?
