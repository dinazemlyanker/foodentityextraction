(DEAL WITH IT.) It\u2019s even moister\u2014which isn\u2019t a word\u2014the day after baking. No one wants a dry pumpkin bread, a mouthful of over-spiced regret, and no one certainly wants a mushy loaf, a soggy forkful of fall\u2019s failings. We want a moist loaf. M-O-I-S-T. Find out what it means to me.It means a lot. And to Molly Baz too. She developed this new recipe and didn\u2019t want a typical vegetable oil quick bread. \u201cLet\u2019s resurrect the pumpkin bread from its sad sorry Starbucks state!\u201d She declared. Okay!!!!Olive oil brings a buttery, barely grassy note that goes well with pumpkin (\u201cbecause pumpkin...comes from the earth,\u201d she told me to which I replied \ud83e\udd14) and it\u2019s what makes the bread moist but never mushy. Molly played with the ratio of flour to fat for weeks until she reached perfection. And since I tasted it, I can concur. Perfection.What else is inside this thing? A heaping dose of AUTUMNAL FLAVOR, that\u2019s what! Cinnamon, nutmeg, a pinch of clove. This specific canned pumpkin. And fresh ginger, not the dry powder stuff. \u201cI didn\u2019t use pumpkin spice mix because I don\u2019t believe in all the spices in that blend,\u201d said Molly. She doesn\u2019t believe in ground ginger. \u201cPeople use \u215b teaspoon a year and then it gets stale and flat in their pantry. Use fresh!\u201d It brings a spicier, more dynamic flavor.ZOOMSCOPE: Crunchy rooftop.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensOn top we\u2019ve got a rooftop of crunchy pumpkin seeds and sugar to make the whole thing shimmer in the evening moonlight. \u201cBasic b*tches love glitter and so do I, let\u2019s be honest,\u201d said Molly.MAPLE BUTTER.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensDon\u2019t forget the side dish of whipped maple butter, light and airy and just a bit salty. It\u2019s best made with an electric mixer, but you can paddle the maple syrup into room temperature butter with a spatula if you can\u2019t be bothered. It won\u2019t be as fluffy, but you\u2019ll have maple butter. There are worse things.\u201cIf I\u2019m not picking apples this weekend,\u201d Molly concluded, \u201cI\u2019ll be making pumpkin bread, and I hope the rest of the world is too.\u201dGet the recipe:Pumpkin Bread with Salted Maple ButterPumpkin Spice Bread gets all grown up thanks to the addition of fresh ginger in this super-moist no-fuss bread with a crunchy pumpkin seed topping.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPumpkinBreadOlive OilDessertFallRecipes you want to make.
