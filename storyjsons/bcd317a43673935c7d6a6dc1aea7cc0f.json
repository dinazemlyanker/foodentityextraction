When something's so easy to make that you don't even need one. Welcome to It's That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.Koreans have an expression, \u201cshiwonhada\u201d (\uc2dc\uc6d0\ud558\ub2e4)\u2014literally, \u201cintensely refreshing and cooling\u201d\u2014that describes the sensation when you feel cool after eating something hot in temperature. Add spiciness to that party and you'll take shiwonhada to the next level. To me, the dish that perfectly captures this experience is the spicy fish stew called maeuntang (\ub9e4\uc6b4\ud0d5). There\u2019s nothing better than dipping a spoonful of this spicy, savory stew into a bowl of steaming white rice.When I was growing up in Seoul, I remember my grandmother hurrying home from the local fish market to prepare this stew for our family. As she prepared the dish, its scent would waft through the house, making my stomach rumble. Because the current Stay At Home order has given me more time to revisit dishes that bring back fond memories, I recently committed my grandmother\u2019s recipe to paper (with a few phone calls to my mother for moral support).The two components to the stew are broth and seasoning paste. To make the broth, take 2 pounds of cleaned whole fish (bass, perch, cod, pollock, or flounder) and cut into 2\" pieces, including the head. Cut about 1 pound Korean radish into bite-size slices. Add the fish and radish to a pot along with the whites of 1 leek, thinly sliced, 1 serrano pepper, thinly sliced, and a big pinch of dried anchovies (approximately 10 pieces). Cover with cold water (about 4 cups) and set over high heat. Once it comes to a boil, reduce your heat and let it simmer for 20 minutes.Everything you need for the broth.\nPhoto and Food Styling by Paul Wang\u00a0While your broth is simmering, make the seasoning paste: In a bowl, add 2 tablespoons gochugaru, a couple turns of ground black pepper, \u00bd tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon fish sauce, 1 tablespoon doenjang or miso, \u00bd tablespoon gochujang, and 4 cloves finely grated garlic. Whisk it all together until it forms a nice paste. (I like to double up on this paste and save the other half to use in a pasta dish for a kick! The paste will keep in your fridge for up to two weeks. You\u2019re welcome.)Now back to the broth: Once it\u2019s been simmering for 20 minutes, gently strain out the pieces of fish into a separate bowl, leaving the fish head in the pot. Add your seasoning paste into the simmering broth and gently mix to disperse. Turn your heat to high and boil your broth for 15 more minutes. Remove the broth from from heat and discard of that fish head. Your liquid should now look like a velvety stew. Finally, take the fish you saved earlier and gently submerge them back into the stew. That\u2019s it!You can eat it right then, but I will say that it\u2019s so much better the next day, once all of its contents have had time to marinate overnight (a very crucial step in developing flavors in anything stewed). So consider making it for your future self. Put a lid on your stew and leave it overnight. (Don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t go bad\u2014Korean grandmothers don\u2019t refrigerate stews.) The next day, bring it back up to a simmer for a few minutes and serve alongside a bowl of steamed rice. Insider\u2019s tip: Taste the radish prior to heating the soup back up. I love sinking my teeth into the cool, marinated radish straight out of the pot.Most of the ingredients in the seasoning paste are shelf-stable pantry items that are great building blocks for many Korean dishes. You'll be able to find these ingredients at a local Asian market, which could really benefit from your business right now. Most have a seafood section in the back where you can choose your fish and they will generously clean it for you, so you don\u2019t even have to get your hands dirty. But if you're trying to reduce trips to the store, here are a few substitution ideas (only if you must!):Instead of a whole fish, use 1 can of sardines in oil (add your sardines and the oil at the very end)Use a few extra dashes of fish sauce instead of dried anchoviesSlice up turnips in place of the Korean radishThere\u2019s no other dish that makes my mouth water just at the thought, that brings a sense of togetherness with my family members who live thousands of miles away, or that gives that \u201cshiwonhada\u201d sensation. May it keep you cool and refreshed during this heated time.Paul Wang was one of the opening chefs at Nonesuch, BA's best new restaurant of 2018.
