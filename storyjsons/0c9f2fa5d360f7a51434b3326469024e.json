For the best results, try to seek out rice that\u2019s been imported from Thailand, as there are many varieties of East Asian short-grain rice that are often labeled \u201csticky rice\u201d but will not cook to the right consistency in this preparation. Traditionally, khao niao is soaked and drained then steamed in a cone-shaped bamboo basket set atop a metal pot of boiling water, but the saucepan and a heatproof fine-mesh sieve with pan hooks combo here works exceptionally well. When ready to serve, keep the rice in a lidded communal container (even at the table) to prevent it from drying out, and always serve it warm. The best utensil for sticky rice is your hand! Pull off a bite\u2019s worth of rice and knead it lightly with the tips of your fingers before eating, the way it\u2019s done in Thailand and Laos. Do your best to let the rice get soaked in saucy or brothy food, as the moisture will break apart the stickiness that holds the grains together.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Fill with cool water and swish rice around a few times with your hand to release starch. When water becomes cloudy, drain rice in sieve; repeat process several times until water runs clear. Pour in water to cover rice by 3\" and let soak at room temperature at least 6 hours and up to 12 hours.Step 2Fill a large saucepan with water to come 2\" up sides and bring to a boil. Drain rice in sieve, then gently make a well in rice (be careful because grains will be brittle and you want to keep them intact). Set sieve over boiling water, cover (lid will not fit tightly, and that\u2019s okay), and steam 15 minutes. (Add more water to pot if needed and return to a boil.)Step 3Uncover and turn rice over in large pieces with a heatproof rubber spatula. Cover and continue to cook until rice is translucent and soft but not mushy, about 15 minutes more. Transfer rice to a bowl to serve. (If rice starts to harden at the table, sprinkle with water, cover with plastic wrap, and microwave on high 1 minute.)How would you rate Khao Niao?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (1)Back to TopTriangleMy family loves Sticky Rice but I only have tank water and cannot be as extravagant with it as this recipe requires.
