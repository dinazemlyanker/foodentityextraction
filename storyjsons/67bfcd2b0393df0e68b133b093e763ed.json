When something's so easy to make that you don't even need one. Welcome to It's That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.\u201cWho wants a cocktail?\u201d is an offer that I always want to make to guests as a lazy summer afternoon begins to bend toward sunset. But the thing is, I\u2019m not trying to spend those precious golden hours squeezing citrus, or making simple syrup, or measuring out dribs and drabs from a bunch of bottles while my friends lounge around expectantly. I want those cocktails to just happen. Which is where homemade sour mix comes in.What is sour mix, you ask? Well, it\u2019s easiest to understand in the context of The Sour, a category of bright and bracing shaken cocktails that you already know and love\u2014think whiskey sours and classic daiquiris, margaritas and gin gimlets\u2014that are all essentially comprised of booze, tart citrus juice, and sugar. Sour mix is simply the sour and sweet elements of that tantalizing trifecta combined in the proper ratio, thus saving you from having to measure them out separately when it\u2019s time to make a drink. You can find a shelf-stable version for sale at most supermarkets, but it\u2019s often fluorescent, corn-syrup laden, and lacking the characteristic bite of freshly squeezed citrus. But the good news is that making sour mix yourself could not be easier, or more delicious.To make a quart of your very own sour mix at home, which is enough for about 18 individual cocktails (!!!), start with 1 grapefruit, 4 limes, and 6 lemons. Give all the citrus a good scrub under cold water to get any schmutz off, and then use a vegetable peeler to remove wide strips of the zest from that grapefruit, all those limes, and three of the lemons. Toss all of the zest into a saucepan along with 1 cup of granulated sugar and \u00bd cup of water, bring the whole situation up to a simmer over medium heat and let it bubble, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is totally dissolved, which should only take 3 or 4 minutes. Take that saucepan off the heat to cool while you get juicing. (You can also set the saucepan in a bowl of ice water if you\u2019re really in a hurry; it doesn\u2019t need to be cold-cold, but it shouldn\u2019t be super hot when you mix it with the citrus juice.)Now, using your citrus juicing-mechanism of choice, go to town on the zested and un-zested citrus. You\u2019re ideally looking to get \u00bd cup grapefruit juice, \u00bd cup lime juice, and 1 cup lemon juice, which may mean that you don\u2019t need to use all of your citrus depending on their juiciness. Strain the juice through a fine mesh sieve into a quart-sized jar or bottle, then strain your zest-infused simple syrup into the same vessel, close tightly, and shake to combine. Ta-da! Homemade sour mix that will stay good for three days in the fridge (if it lasts that long).Having a batch of this sunny concoction waiting in my fridge means any number of refreshing, heat-beating drinks can be ready at the drop of a hat. Simply combine 2 oz. booze and 1\u00be oz. sour mix in a cocktail shaker, fill with ice, shake hard, strain straight-up into frosted coupes or rocks glasses filled with fresh ice, and serve. Mixology types might balk at this loosey-goosey approach to cocktails in the sour family\u2014a daiquiri is technically made with only lime juice; a margarita typically also contains orange liqueur\u2014but you know what? Whether I\u2019ve combined this sour mix with whiskey or rum, tequila or mezcal, gin or vodka, I\u2019ve never heard a single person complain about the resulting drink. They do always ask for another, though\u2014and I tell them they can go ahead and shake up the next round.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimpleBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
