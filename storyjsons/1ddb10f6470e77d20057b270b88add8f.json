I get it: There\u2019s something about a prodigious hunk of meat or platter of jeweled rice that feels festive in a way that spinach and kale simply do not. Still, I\u2019m a vegetables-first kind of cook, which means I\u2019m constantly searching for a high-impact dish that also helps me hit my RDA. So when I heard about this new shaved carrot and charred date salad, it was basically like finding my salad Holy Grail. And yes, I realize how lame that sounds.Take it from a true salad obsessive: This recipe is fancier and more flavorful than any of its siblings. That\u2019s because it\u2019s built around a base of tender-but-crisp shaved carrots, which look striking and soak up a punchy citrus dressing like a pro. Time to break out your mandoline (and finger guard!) or practice your knife skills.The second key component of this salad is citrus. Grapefruit or blood oranges would both work great here, but I went with deep purple blood oranges for a heady contrast to my orange carrots because I\u2019m a sucker for aesthetics. After cutting the flesh off the core in lobes (a cheff-y technique called \u201csupreming\u201d that\u2019s much less fussy than it sounds), I squeezed out some juice to build a zingy, bright dressing and fortified it with unseasoned rice vinegar for a little extra kick.While the carrots hung out in their citrusy bath, I moved on to the final fancy component: the blackened dates. It\u2019s just a bit of simple charring, accomplished in a hot cast iron skillet, but the key part here is to wait until they\u2019re cool before popping out the pits and tearing the sticky fruit into bite-sized pieces. (Learn from my mistakes and save your fingers the pain!) Then sprinkle some tarragon on top of the whole thing, because you\u2019ve come this far.All together, this salad is a whole lot more than the sum of its parts. There\u2019s something about the combination of crunchy carrots, soft charred dates, and a tangy-sweet citrus dressing that feels much more complex than any raw vegetable deserves to be. It\u2019s a kaleidoscope of color and flavor that goes toe-to-toe with any hearty main\u2014and leaves limp lettuce in the dust.Get the recipe:Shaved Carrots with Charred DatesTangy, crunchy carrots meet soft and sweet blackened dates for literally everything you want in one bite.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titSaladCarrotDateCitrusBlood OrangeRice VinegarRead MorecookingThe Glazed Brussels Sprouts You\u2019ll Be Making All FallBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
