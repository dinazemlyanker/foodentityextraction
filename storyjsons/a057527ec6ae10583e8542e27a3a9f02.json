Cut the Tillamook Sweet Cream Unsalted Butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse meal. Whisk together the sour cream, lemon juice and water in a small bowl and add to the flour gently tossing and stirring with a fork until the flour is well moistened and has come together into a lumpy moist dough. Divide into two disks and wrap each with plastic wrap. Refrigerate 1 hour or overnight.Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out one disk to \u215b-inch thickness. Using a 4-inch round biscuit cutter, cut out 9 rounds transferring to a baking sheet cut. Repeat with the remaining dough. Refrigerate the rounds at least 30 minutes.Meanwhile, in a small non-stick saucepan, stir together the apples, sugar, cinnamon and a pinch of salt. Cook over low heat, stirring frequently, until the apples are glossy and tender, and the liquid is thick and syrupy, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl to cool completely. Stir in the Tillamook Sharp Cheddar, thyme and honey. Just prior to filling the pies, drain any accumulated liquid from the apple-cheddar filling.Whisk together the egg and water. Working with 1 sheet of rounds at a time, spoon 1 Tbsp. filling onto the center of each round. Lightly brush around edge with eggwash, then fold round in half over the filling, pressing edge to seal. Decoratively reinforce the edge pressing with the tines of a fork. If the dough gets too warm to work with, chill rounds before continuing.  Repeat with remaining rounds. Brush the tops lightly with egg wash and chill the assembled hand pies 30 minutes.Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F with oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven. Bake, rotating midway through baking, until hand pies are golden, about 15 to 20 minutes. Cool on racks slightly before serving.Tillamook is a farmer-owned cooperative based in Oregon that connects farmers and food lovers through better-made dairy products.
