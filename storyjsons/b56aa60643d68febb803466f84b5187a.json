I\u2019m sorry but sometimes no cake, sauce, nor dip is worth that frustration\u2014and the mess that gets left behind.That\u2019s where Soom tahini comes in. It\u2019s so silky-smooth that you never have to stir. For lazy tahini fiends like me, that means I\u2019m cooking and baking with tahini more often. And since Soom is so delicious\u2014nutty, earthy, and just the right level of bitter\u2014it also makes what I\u2019m cooking taste just plain better.I first read about Soom in Michael Solomov\u2019s first book Zahav, in which he deems it his favorite brand. The Philadelphia-based, sister-owned company sources its White Humera sesame seeds from the Tigray region of northwest Ethiopia, then sends them to Israel, where they\u2019re roasted and pressed. The seeds have the ideal oil to meat ratio, meaning that it doesn\u2019t take any extra oil or additives for the tahini to remain emulsified\u2014so you can get to cooking, not to stirring.Photo by Chelsie CraigSoom Premium Tahini$9 at Bon App\u00e9tit MarketExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendTahiniMiddle EasternShoppingRead MoreCrispy Roasted Broccoli with Tahini SauceRecipes you want to make.
