It\u2019s a good stand-in for when you don\u2019t want to bother making fish stock (i.e., most of the time).Ingredients4 servings2Tbsp. unsalted butter4oz. bacon, chopped1medium onion, chopped1medium leek, halved lengthwise, thinly sliced crosswise2celery stalks, chopped2bay leaves1lb. small red potatoes, scrubbed, quartered4cups no-salt-added clam juiceKosher salt, freshly ground pepper1lb. hot-smoked trout, skin removed, flesh broken into small pieces1cup buttermilk, room temperature\u00bdcup heavy cream, room temperatureTrout roe (for serving; optional)PreparationStep 1Heat butter in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-low.

I\u2019d do 1/2 c. Buttermilk and 1 c. heavy cream next time. Apple PaltrowBoston, MA 10/17/2021Wonderful flavor and it came together beautifully.  Couldn't get no salt added clam juice, so i eliminated adding any salt at all.  I did use smoked sable fish as well as the smoked trout to mix it up and the combo of textures was really a nice contrast.  Definitely will make this again.Deb C4/2/2021Question: does it have to be smoked trout or may I use baked trout?R.
