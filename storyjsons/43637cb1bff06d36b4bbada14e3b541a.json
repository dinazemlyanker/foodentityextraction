Remove fronds from fennel bulbs and thinly slice; set aside. Thinly slice fennel bulb; set aside. Thinly slice all but 1 garlic clove. Combine sliced garlic, fennel bulb, onion, anchovies, drained tomatoes, wine, fennel seeds, 1\u00bd tsp. red pepper flakes, and \u2153 cup oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot. Season with a generous pinch of salt and cover pot, leaving lid slightly askew. Bake until tomatoes are dark red and jammy, 1\u00bc\u20131\u00bd hours.Step 2While tomato sauce is cooking away in the oven, mix mayonnaise and lemon juice in a small bowl. Finely grate remaining garlic clove into mayonnaise, season with salt and pepper, and mix together. Cover and set aside.Step 3Remove pot from oven and crush tomatoes against the side of the pot with a wooden spoon to break them up. Stir in clam juice and reserved tomato juices; season with salt. Place pot over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Add clams, pushing into the liquid so they are all submerged. Cover pot and cook just until clams start to open, about 5 minutes. Add mussels, cover, and cook just until mussels start to open, about 5 minutes. Remove lid and use spoon to push shellfish into center of pot. Arrange scallops around perimeter, nestling into liquid so they\u2019re just barely submerged. Cover pot again and simmer just until scallops are cooked through, about 4 minutes.Step 4Ladle stew into bowls; discarding any clams or mussels that are not open. Drizzle with more oil and sprinkle with more red pepper flakes. Scatter reserved fennel fronds over top and tuck a lemon wedge into each bowl. Slather seasoned mayonnaise over toast and serve alongside.Step 5Do Ahead: Tomatoes can be roasted 1 day ahead. Add clam and tomato juices and let cool. Cover and chill. Bring to a simmer over low heat before making the stew.How would you rate Spicy Tomato Shellfish Stew?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleThis was a fantastic recipe!!  I followed exactly and added some small sea scallops that I had on hand.  The flavors were perfectly balanced and the stew made a great accompaniment to a nice crusty loaf of french bread.  Definitely a winner and will find a place in my regular meal rotation.  Andy RummelDanvers, IL4/17/2021really good recipe! easy to make and leave in the oven. has to be served with bread and side salad or else it is not filling. added scallops and shrimp and it was great! the anchovy paste and clam juice add so much flavor!Kiersten Wasserman2/15/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titStewSoups and StewsClamShellfishSeafoodMusselScallopCanned TomatoTomatoVegetableFennelOne-Pot MealsMainNut-FreeHealthyishSimmerDinnerRecipes you want to make.
