When something\u2019s so easy to make that you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.My youngest sister recently reminded me that our paternal grandmother, who we called Mader (mother in Dari), kept a specific journal filled with some of her special yogurt-based recipes, ranging from mint-scented cucumber raita to pumpkin borani.\u00a0Borani is a cold dish composed of a roasted or saut\u00e9ed vegetable paired with thick, creamy yogurt, often adorned with spices, nuts, fried onions, fresh herbs, and olive oil. Cooked and beloved in Afghanistan and Iran, borani can be served as an appetizer with bread or crackers, as a side dish, or on its own for a light meal. According to legend (and what I heard in my family growing up), the dish gets its name from the Sasanian empress B\u016br\u0101ndo\u1e35t, who loved cold yogurt-based dishes so much, they were named after her as B\u016br\u0101n\u012b. To this day, Afghans and Persians are passionate about yogurt-based dishes, and my Mader was evidence. Sadly, I don\u2019t have her handwritten recipes, neither for raita nor borani, but I do remember how much she adored them.This recipe is Andy Baraghani\u2019s version of borani esfanaj.\nAlex LauSome of my favorite borani are borani bademjaan, made with fried slices of eggplant and served with a slick of spiced tomato sauce atop the yogurt, and borani esfanaj, made with garlicky saut\u00e9ed spinach stirred into yogurt.\u00a0In the colder months, however, I love to prepare borani kadoo (kadoo means \u201cpumpkin\u201d or \u201csquash\u201d in Dari) with butternut squash. While the pumpkin or squash is traditionally cooked in a tangy tomato sauce for this type of borani, I find that butternut squash speaks for itself and needs no sauce. The soft sweetness of it against the cooling garlicky yogurt and the crunch of the pomegranate arils makes for a wonderful meal on its own or served alongside grilled meat. I also like to add hazelnuts in place of the classic addition of walnuts. And while borani is traditionally made by mixing the vegetables and the yogurt together, I follow my mother\u2019s tradition of leaving the two separate when I plate it\u2014it\u2019s merely a matter of styling and serving and you can do whichever you prefer.To make this borani kadoo, which serves 4, start by cutting a 3\u20134 lb. butternut squash to separate the bulb from the neck. For this dish, you will use only the neck (save the bulb for another delicious recipe). Peel it (make sure to completely remove the white fibrous layer), halve lengthwise, and slice into \u00bd\"-thick half-moons. Heat your oven to 450\u00b0 F. Lay the prepared butternut squash on a rimmed baking sheet and toss with \u00bc cup neutral oil (I like to use sunflower) and season with salt. Roast in the lower third of the oven for 15\u201320 minutes, turning the pieces of butternut squash halfway through, until they\u2019re cooked through and starting to char. Remove butternut squash from the oven and allow to cool slightly, about 15 minutes.While the butternut squash is roasting, place a small frying pan with 2 Tbsp. olive oil on medium-high heat. Add 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped, and stir till fragrant and slightly golden, about 90 seconds. Transfer saut\u00e9ed garlic and oil to a medium-size bowl, and whisk with 1 tsp. kosher salt and 1\u00bd cups full-fat Greek-style yogurt. You can also skip cooking the garlic\u2014grate the cloves directly into the yogurt. Chill in the refrigerator (this can be prepared a day ahead).Using a spatula or spoon, spread yogurt evenly in a serving dish with a wide base. Arrange butternut squash on top. Sprinkle with \u00bd cup pomegranate arils, 2 Tbsp. toasted and roughly chopped hazelnuts, and 1 Tbsp. pul biber. These coarse chile flakes, also known as Aleppo pepper, are found in Turkey and Syria and have a moderate kick of heat and a slight tang. (You can use sweet or smoked paprika if you don\u2019t have pul biber in your pantry.) Drizzle with olive oil and scatter over fresh dill or whichever fresh herb you love. Scoop it up with warm bread or enjoy as is.Borani is a very versatile dish\u2014try creating your own versions with whichever vegetable you love throughout the seasons. After all, Mader had an entire book dedicated to these yogurt-based dishes\u2014she must have been onto something!Shayma Owaise Saadat is a Toronto-based writer whose work focuses on food, culture, and identity.
