I grabbed the limp vegetables hiding in the crisper, the chicken carcasses and pork bones on the cusp of freezer burn, some chopped onions, and an old parm rind. I threw it all in a pot of water. I brought it to a simmer. I called it a day. This is a perfectly adequate approach, especially for any other cooks who straddle lazy and productive like me. And I was content to continue down this path of perfectly fine broth until I worked with Eric Sze, the chef-owner of 886 and wenwen in New York City, on this guide to hot pot.I snuck into the test kitchen while he and assistant food editor Jessie YuChen were cross-testing the broths for the story, and I was blown away by how delicious a vegetarian broth could be. I only slurped one spoonful, but even so I remember it clearly. It was unlike any broth I\u2019d ever made: rich and deep with mushroomy flavor and distinctly herbal angelica root, thick and silken in texture like good tonkatsu, and rounded with a wisp of sweetness from rock sugar. I had a broth awakening.\u201cCooking is like building a house,\u201d Sze told me later on. \u201cYou need to lay a foundation, then put down the bricks, the walls, the roof. Broth is very much the same thing.\u201dFor him, broth isn\u2019t a reactive response to what\u2019s in your fridge but rather a proactive choice to build something delicious. This isn\u2019t to say that making an intentional broth will require much more effort than what you are already doing. When you decide to make broth, you\u2019re already committing a certain amount of time and energy\u2014here, Sze focuses that time and energy so the final liquidy product is less shot in the dark and more bull\u2019s-eye. Below are the techniques, tips, and mantras he relies on to make broths with a little more intent and a lot more flavor.1. Pick your base ingredient.Before you start cooking, figure out what kind of broth you want: veg or meat? Whatever you choose, make sure you get a variety of that base ingredient. That means, if you\u2019re doing a mushroom broth, don\u2019t just buy shiitake but also enoki, king oyster, and portobello. If you\u2019re making tomato soup, turn to fresh tomatoes, canned tomatoes, and paste. For cabbage soup, seek out Napa cabbage, green cabbage, savoy cabbage, and Taiwanese cabbage. Or, if you\u2019re craving a beefy broth, get several types of beef bones and cuts: shank, top round, even ground beef. \u201cIt adds another element,\u201d Sze shares. \u201cYou want the same umbrella of flavor but different pockets and punches of that flavor.\u201d2. Then show it some TLC.Once you\u2019ve chosen your path, prep that base ingredient. For a veg broth, cook down the base ingredient in a pan (or roast in an oven) to sweat out all the moisture and concentrate the flavor. For a meat broth, Sze blanches the bones to clean them before adding to the broth. \u201cThat\u2019s my Taiwanese heritage talking,\u201d Sze says.3. Unleash Maillard.If vegetables or meat are your superheroes, aromatics are their trusty sidekicks. Sze\u2019s favorites come from the allium family\u2014onions, garlic, scallions, leeks\u2014which he gives a rough chop and browns in a pan, a crucial step. This upgrades your already very flavorful and fragrant aromatics to Super Saiyan level (I\u2019ve been watching a lot of anime recently). \u201cBroth never exceeds 212\u00b0F, so you need to unlock the Maillard reaction in the aromatics before adding the liquid,\u201d he says. \u201cSear them to get them golden brown, then drop them into liquid.\u201d4. Add depth beyond salt.\u00a0You\u2019re likely already salting your broth, but you\u2019re probably not adding Taiwanese rice wine, MSG, or sugar for depth. And I would say that these ingredients are where the magic of Sze\u2019s mind-blowing broths lies. \u201cI always reach for Taiwanese rice wine, which balances out any gaminess from meat and also works well for veg broths,\u201d Sze says. Just as valuable and versatile is MSG, which brings umami to whatever it graces, and rock sugar, a staple pantry ingredient in many Asian households, including Sze\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s the same as cane sugar, and it\u2019s inexplicable,\u201d he explains. \u201cI add in a little bit at a time, tasting as I go. The sugar accentuates whatever flavors you\u2019ve already developed.\u201d5. Take your time.\u201cTime is the most expensive ingredient\u201d is Sze\u2019s mantra. Once you have all your ingredients ready\u2014blanched bones or sweated-out vegetables, caramelized aromatics, rice wine, MSG, and sugar\u2014add water and bring it to a vigorous boil. Then sit back and relax.Vegetable broths come together quicker, usually around 90 minutes, whereas meat broths can take about 12 to 24 hours or until \u201cthe broth tastes pungent and not like tap water,\u201d Sze says. Sure, you could try a pressure cooker, but Sze has misgivings. \u201cIt increases the pressure so that things cook faster, but it doesn\u2019t release moisture,\u201d and liquid needs to evaporate for flavors to concentrate, he says. Think about it: \u201cSun-dried tomatoes have intense tomato flavor because they\u2019re totally dehydrated.\u201d Anecdotally, any time Sze has tried to pressure-cook broth, it hasn\u2019t come out as good compared to ye olde broth-making. \u201cNot scientifically proven\u2014just my personal opinion,\u201d he adds.6. Skim off the right stuff.If you see any scum\u2014those light brown, cloudy clusters of denatured protein\u2014ladle it out. It\u2019s not bad for you, just ugly. But hold off on skimming the fat. \u201cFat is your friend,\u201d Sze says. \u201cI like to fish out the fat at the end, so I can choose exactly how much fat I want in the broth. Any extra fat I keep for stir-fries.\u201d Once the broth is done boiling, strain it, cool it, then remove as much fat as you want. All you\u2019re left with is liquid gold.Now you\u2019re ready for your own broth awakening.Broth o\u2019clockMala Beef Hot Pot BrothThis fiery red broth is a labor of love, but it\u2019s worth it\u2014your hot pot spread depends on a rich, flavorful base.View RecipeHerbal Mushroom Hot Pot BrothUmami-rich and flavorful all on its own, this vegan hot pot base is also a welcome palate cleanser when served alongside a spicy broth.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
