Kwon loves food. This was among the first things she told me when I called her to discuss the array of takeout and picnics and buffets in her smash debut novel, The Incendiaries. Okay, The Incendiaries is actually about an extremist Christian cult, called Jejah, with ties to North Korea. But it\u2019s also about food. Separately, food and cults, cults and food, are pretty powerful collective interests. But together? They make for a summer read you\u2019re about to add to your queue if you haven\u2019t already.In The Incendiaries, a young woman, Phoebe Lin, is drawn into Jejah by its charismatic leader, John Leal, while her boyfriend, Will Kendall, watches with alarm as its practices grow more and more radical\u2014culminating in the bombings of five abortion clinics. (I promise, this isn\u2019t a spoiler.) If it sounds like a lot, well, it is. The novel deals with religion, extremism, geopolitics, gender, and class\u2014and it uses food as a way to navigate these hefty themes. Meals described in lush, sensory detail anchor many scenes, helping to ground the characters in their literal, physical needs. At the same time, they mirror the way extreme faith can seem to mend the losses Will and Phoebe have both suffered: Will continues to grapple with the loss of the evangelical faith he believed in from childhood, while Phoebe still blames herself for a death in her family.The first time Will and Phoebe gather with the members of the cult, it\u2019s over an abundant\u2014and somewhat menacing\u2014dinner. \u201cPink meat bled when I cut it open, the charred bits crunching like minute bones. A torn roll steamed; butter liquefied. Oil dripped, gilding white porcelain. Teeth flashed, smiling,\u201d observes Will. The meal is pure temptation. \u201cOf all people, I should have recognized this warmth for what it was: a bag of tricks. The fellowship, a little food,\u201d Will continues. (After all, having lost his faith during his first year at bible college, Will is best equipped to see through the illusion.) \u201cThe hocus-pocus bribe of hot bread, lavish, like God: take, eat. This is my body, which is broken for you.\u201dDiners are tempted by a similar illusion at the local restaurant where Will works, a haute Italian place run by a gruff manager named Paul. (To illustrate these scenes, Kwon drew on her own experiences working in food service for a summer.) Will waits tables to pay his bills and scrounges for apples from the campus dining hall to tide him over between family meals. At the restaurant, he\u2019s taunted by white-peach Bellinis; limoncello; and spumoni in cherry, chocolate, and pistachio, compounding his constant hunger. But the diners he\u2019s serving don\u2019t care much about the particulars of the restaurant\u2019s suckling pig ravioli, or its poached quail. One table berates him when he\u2019s unable to fulfill their precise demands. For them, the food itself isn\u2019t especially important\u2014it\u2019s what it communicates. As Paul puts it, \u201cThey\u2019re wild about a first-rate place like this because it\u2019s selling an illusion,\u201d he says. \u201cTo be fed well is also to feel loved.\u201d Kwon deftly evokes both the physical and emotional experience of a good restaurant dinner here\u2014it\u2019s almost churchlike, underscoring how this kind of fulfillment remains just out of Will\u2019s reach.To demonstrate his own love, Will plans a picnic for Phoebe, bringing along a basket spilling over with \u201cstilton hunks, fat-pebbled p\u00e2t\u00e9. Plum jam. The half-baguette. Ripe peaches. Mulled wine in a jug,\u201d she recalls, conjuring both the sweetness of the gesture (she recognizes such a spread is beyond Will\u2019s means) and its excess (\u201cI ate too much, past appetite,\u201d she says). Later, while in Beijing for a summer internship, Will indulges in various meals throughout the summer: \u201cI glutted myself on roasted Peking duck and paper-wrapped trout, mapo tofu and thrice-cooked bacon. Boiled, succulent jiaozi. Lamb shish kebabs. Mouth-stinging Sichuan hotpots. Baozi. Jianbang. Spiced grass carp,\u201d he lists. He\u2019s insatiable\u2014because for the first time, he can afford to feed himself. But the series of meals also stands in for the sense of wholeness he once found in his faith. Each flavor is more powerful, each scent more pungent than the last; as you read, it\u2019s almost tangible, communicating the depths of Will\u2019s nostalgia for the time when he believed. \u201cI was imagining he, in part, loves the food in Beijing because it reminds him of the time just before he lost his faith,\u201d Kwon said. \u201cThere\u2019s possibly some comfort he draws from that.\u201d Even as it traverses the globe, The Incendiaries inevitably comes back to food, engaging each of the senses to bring the reader wholly into Will and Phoebe\u2019s world.But among the deadly sins, gluttony is deadliest\u2014at least for Jejah\u2019s adherents. As the cult grows more fanatic, its leader requires his followers, Phoebe included, to fast, to \u201cdeny themselves those carnal pleasures\u2014or those carnal needs,\u201d Kwon told me. In their effort to achieve some kind of spiritual satisfaction, the members embrace their emptiness. \u201cWe believed with our bodies,\u201d Phoebe says. It\u2019s here that the promise of the cult begins to fracture, in the confusion between needs and desires. But that\u2019s all I\u2019ll give away here.\u201cI wanted to write a book in which I could give witness to what it felt like both to lose a faith that I believed ardently in,\u201d Kwon told me, \u201cbut also what it felt like to fall into it\u2014how incredible it felt when I did believe in God.\u201d The temptation for Phoebe and Will is a spiritual appetite satiated, the promise a stomach filled. But this, too, is an illusion: The hunger always returns, eventually.Buy The Incendiaries here.Explore Bon App\u00e9titBooksRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
