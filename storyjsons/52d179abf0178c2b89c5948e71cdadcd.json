I've served it with roasted slices of sweet winter squash, and with fried tofu.  JavalinaDavis, CA1/29/2022Where in Yemen is this being made? Never heard of it. Have not tried it but it\u2019s not something that anyone in my part of Yemen has made. What we do is take jalape\u00f1o garlic and tomato  mash it up add salt and call it a day. You could add cilantro or parsley or mint you could add cumin. But most common is jalape\u00f1o garlic tomato and cilantro. And it\u2019s an everyday condiment.
