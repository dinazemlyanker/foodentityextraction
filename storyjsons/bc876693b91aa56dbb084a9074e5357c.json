I had purchased the kind that comes in a metal can. As I was vigorously stirring the tahini, trying in vain to get the oil and the chalky paste to coalesce, my hand slipped, and I sliced my finger open on the sharp edge of the metal lid. There was no hummus that day. Only blood.Now is not the time to be going to the hospital for tahini-related accidents. If you\u2019re purchasing a jar to make these Tahini Billionaire Bars or another baking project, seek out a brand that requires minimal or no stirring\u2014like Seed+ Mill, Soom, or Beirut.\u201cFresh, good-quality tahini will be much more homogenous than an older, low-quality one,\u201d says senior food editor and tahini fanboy Andy Baraghani. \u201cOil is inevitably going to rise, and you shouldn\u2019t necessarily be put off by separated tahini. But if it\u2019s been processed properly and hasn\u2019t been sitting on a shelf for months, you\u2019ll see less of that.\u201dFor baking, homogeneity is key. \u201cIf you\u2019re measuring out half a cup and it\u2019s all oil or all chalk, you\u2019ll get an incorrect result,\u201d says Basically editor Sarah Jampel, who not only developed the recipe for Tahini Billionaire Bars but also wrote an entire ode to Soom tahini. \u201cYou either need to buy tahini that is nice and smooth or stir the heck out of it beforehand.\u201d If you\u2019re averse to stirring and find your tahini has separated like Harry Styles and whoever he was last dating, Sarah suggests dumping the whole jar in the blender or food processor.In addition to texture, flavor is another indicator of tahini\u2019s quality and freshness. \u201cTahini has a slight bitterness that most other nut or seed butters don\u2019t,\u201d says Andy. \u201cIt\u2019s quite savory. You want it to taste earthy, nutty, and rich.\u201d But if that bitterness tips over into astringency\u2014that mouth-drying sensation that you get from a tannic red wine\u2014that is not the tahini for you.In addition to Soom, Andy and Sarah like Seed+Mill\u2014which, like Soom, is made from Ethiopian sesame seeds and processed in Israel\u2014and Beirut brand tahini from Lebanon. And, luckily for me, all of these come in jars with screw-top lids.Organic Tahini 16 oz$12 at Seed + Mill$13 at SnukSoom Foods Single-Source Pure Ground Sesame Tahini Paste 11oz (2 Pack)$17 at AmazonBeirut Tahini Sesame Paste 32 Oz$12 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingBasically BakingTahiniRecipes you want to make.
