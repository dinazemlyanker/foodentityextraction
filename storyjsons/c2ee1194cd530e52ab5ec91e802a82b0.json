And then it changed.\u00a0By Priya KrishnaNovember 20, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Laura MurrayFacebookTwitterEmailEvery year, food magazines will attempt to reinvent Thanksgiving dinner. We are not exempt. Wrap your turkey in bacon! Stuffing fried rice! Sprinkle MSG in your gravy! And so on. But let me tell you a secret: We all know that when it comes to pumpkin pie, most people are making the exact same recipe year after year, and that\u2019s the one on the back of Libby\u2019s canned pumpkin.The Libby\u2019s recipe is so widely circulated that you may not even know you\u2019re using it. It goes something like this: blend pumpkin filling, evaporated milk, eggs, ginger, cloves, cinnamon, sugar, and a pinch of salt, pour into a pie shell, bake for close to an hour. Let cool to room temperature. The finished pie is moist (but not tooooo moist), smooth (with just a liiittle texture), and tickles you\u2014but doesn\u2019t hit you in the face\u2014with warming spices. It\u2019s the mild, silky, whipped-cream-dolloped coda you crave after a hefty Thanksgiving meal. Sound familiar?The truth is, Libby\u2019s version may not be the most interesting or most creative recipe. There are thousands more on the internet. You could whip out the kitchen torch to br\u00fbl\u00e9e your pumpkin pie. Add miso to it, go crazy. But Libby\u2019s is the one that many people consider to be the gold standard for how pumpkin pie is supposed to taste. Myself included.The first time I had pumpkin pie was at my school cafeteria when I was about eight years old. It was the Libby\u2019s version. The homogeneous texture was weird and alarming at first. How did they get it so smooth? The barely-there taste of ginger and cinnamon made me wonder why not just add a little more? But I couldn\u2019t stop eating it. From then on I made sure that pumpkin pie was added to my family\u2019s Thanksgiving rotation, which up until then consisted of apple pie and shrikhand, a dessert of strained cardamom-flavored yogurt. Slowly, pumpkin pie outstripped all the other sweets in popularity. I ate it for breakfast the next morning. And many mornings after that. I was obsessed, but specifically with the Libby\u2019s version.But imagine if these were pies.\nPhoto by Laura Murray, prop styling by Allie WistLibby\u2019s was started as Libby, McNeill & Libby, a canned meat company in Chicago, in the late 1800s. That\u2019s right\u2014canned meat. The company brought canned pumpkin into its fold in the late 1920s, when it purchased Dickinson & Co. of Eureka, Illinois. Pumpkin, in general, was having a moment, conjuring \u201csaccharine-sweet images of rural New England life\u201d during a time when people were moving into cities, says Cindy Ott, a professor at the University of Delaware and the author of Pumpkin: The Curious History of an American Icon. Pumpkin pie had become synonymous with the pumpkin thanks to the dish\u2019s growing association with Thanksgiving. That association started around 1827, when magazine editor Sarah Josepha Hale published a novel, Northwood, which listed pumpkin pie as part of the traditional Thanksgiving meal. This was also due to a popular pumpkin pudding recipe published in Amelia Simmons\u2019s 1796 American Cookery, one of the first American cookbooks. Her pudding called for pumpkin, milk, molasses, eggs, ginger, and allspice.Libby\u2019s hired a recipe developer named Mary Hale Martin to start a home economics department and promote recipes for its various canned products. The pumpkin pie recipe that Libby's and Martin were to make famous first appeared on the back of a Libby\u2019s can, in 1929. It was quite straightforward: canned pumpkin, eggs, milk, sugar, cloves, allspice, and cinnamon (there\u2019s no recipe for a crust; it simply says \u201cpour into a pie pan lined with pastry\u201d). In the 1950s the recipe was adjusted to the version most people know today, with the additions of dried ginger and evaporated milk, which cuts the cooking time and brings a more intense dairy flavor.Before Libby\u2019s recipe, pumpkin pie was considered a labor of love. It required breaking down, seeding, roasting, and mashing the gourd. Canned pumpkin existed well before Libby\u2019s, but it was the company\u2019s decision to pair this recipe with its low-moisture canned pumpkin (for perfectly-creamy-not-soggy pies) that was a game changer. Suddenly pumpkin pie was a dessert anyone could whip up in an hour.Soon the recipe was everywhere, becoming a fixture on the can and in widely circulated magazine advertisements. (It likely helped that in 1971 the company was acquired by Nestle, which had a huge reach in grocery store aisles.) These days if you Google \u201cpumpkin pie recipe,\u201d the results that pop up are either the Libby\u2019s recipe or versions that are slight modifications of it. Libby\u2019s now produces 85 percent of canned pumpkin in the United States.I recently put out a call on social media asking for everyone\u2019s favorite back-of-the-package Thanksgiving recipe. Almost everyone responded with the Libby\u2019s pumpkin pie.\u201cIt seems to be the perfect recipe,\u201d Greg Bair, a Dallas-based lawyer tells me. \u201cIf you add or take away from it, it is not as good.\u201dUnlike other Thanksgiving staples, when it comes to pumpkin pie, people don\u2019t want anything but the classic\u2014the Libby\u2019s version. My family\u2019s Thanksgiving abides by our Indian-ish philosophy, with spice-heavy fall dishes matar paneer, aloo gobhi, and a fenugreek-y sweet-and-sour butternut squash. But when a certain family member who was in charge of desserts tried to propose a pumpkin pie seasoned with cardamom and maple syrup, there was a full-on riot. We love cardamom. We love maple syrup. But neither are welcome in our pumpkin pie. We don\u2019t want the heady spices. We don\u2019t need any of that earthy sweetness. We know the best pumpkin pies have rustic gourd flavor front and center.\u201cPeople expect pumpkin pie to taste like the Libby\u2019s recipe because that shaped the Platonic ideal of a pumpkin pie,\u201d explains Marilyn Naron, an illustrator and former pastry chef (and self-identifying Libby\u2019s pumpkin pie fan) based in Lawrence, Kansas. \u201cIf you bite into a pumpkin pie that doesn\u2019t taste like that, it will inevitably feel a bit disappointing.\u201dLet\u2019s not forget that the recipe continues to be one of the easiest dishes you can put together for a Thanksgiving table. Faced with cooking a meal that can seem daunting and complicated, it\u2019s comforting for less experienced cooks to know there\u2019s at least one element that\u2019s a sure win.The consistency! It almost already looks like pie filling.\nPhoto by Laura MurrayA few weeks ago Libby\u2019s shocked customers by announcing that it was changing its recipe after 70 or so years to add sweetened condensed milk, less sugar, and slightly different spice ratios. Meredith Tomason, a test kitchen manager for Nestl\u00e9, says the change was inspired by a desire to \u201cgive new life\u201d to the recipe, as she saw that more young home cooks were taking on the challenge of cooking Thanksgiving dinner for the first time. Sweetened condensed milk makes the pie batter easier to mix and the finished product a little creamier, she adds. (Both the old and new versions are listed on the back of the can.)The change was breathlessly covered online (\u201cThanksgiving Shake-Up: Libby\u2019s Changes Iconic Pie Recipe\u201d \u201cLibby\u2019s Has a New Pumpkin Pie Recipe for the First Time In...Well, Ever\u201d), but given the vast popularity of the existing recipe, people on the internet weren\u2019t thrilled.\u201cWhy add more cloves to the ingredients? It was just fine the way it was,\u201d complained one commenter on Libby\u2019s Facebook page.\u201cI think I will stick to the original!\u201d said another.\u201cNot cool, yo,\u201d someone huffed.\u201cThat pie is about home and family and comfort,\u201d Naron says. No matter how many versions are published, that 1950s version \u201cis always going to be at the top of the pumpkin pie hierarchy.\u201dI tend to agree. Pumpkin pie isn\u2019t about bringing the jazziest, most complicated version to the table. It\u2019s about bringing the most nostalgic one. And by that measure, all roads seem to lead to the back of the Libby\u2019s can.Read more: This Is the Only Canned Pumpkin You Should Ever BuyExplore Bon App\u00e9titThanksgivingPieRead MorePumpkin Chiffon Pierecipes40 Thanksgiving Pie Recipes & Ideas That'll Keep Everyone Going Back For MoreGallery40 SlidesBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
