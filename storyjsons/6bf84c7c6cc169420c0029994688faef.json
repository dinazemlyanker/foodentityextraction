So when the day finally comes to loll on a blanket under the sun, you want to make the most of it. With a few essentials on hand, you can simplify your experience and extend your time on the shore. So what\u2019s it going to take to keep you situated in the sand fuss-free? We\u2019ve got you covered.Be BasicThis may seem like a no-brainer, but when you\u2019re packing your beach bag, start with the basics. First: SPF. You\u2019ll want at least 30 if you\u2019re planning to spend the day along the shore. A beach hat would be advisable, as it goes above and beyond (literally) your sunnies for more protection. Next, throw in a water bottle for all-day hydration, a good book you\u2019ve been waiting to devour, and a beach blanket. But forget the standard towel\u2014opt for a big summery blanket that fits a friend (or two).Snack SmartRepeat after me: Do not go to the beach hungry. Aside from risking a Hulk-like rage on a beach umbrella, hunger will also cut your beach day short. Pack easy, refreshing snacks like watermelon in a sealed container. Melon has high water content, so it doubles as a juicy and delicious hydrator while you\u2019re sweating it out in the sun.For a more filling and savory snack, new Stacy\u2019s\u00ae Cheese Petites come in Romano with Garlic and Pepper, and Parmesan with Rosemary\u2013and each have six grams of protein per serving. Their snackable nature is due to the fact that cheese is the first and foremost ingredient (because cheese), and it doesn\u2019t hurt that you can grab a handful, pass it around, and easily reseal it with no fuss or clean up. Want that cheesy deliciousness on hand all the time, even when you\u2019re not at the beach? For a limited time, head over to stacyssnacks.com for a 20% off promo code.Go Beyond H2OYou could crack open a seltzer, but why not make it a little Self-Care Saturday? (You\u2019re already getting your weekly dose of vitamin D.) We like the fizzy, probiotic-packed boost of kombucha. Think of it as a thumbs-up for your gut, which is kind of like the control center for your body. A good \u2018buch can aid in digestion, ease inflammation, and, if consumed over time, help ward off disease. So drink up!We're SpritzingYou\u2019re bathing in the sun. You\u2019re glistening from joy and also heat. You\u2019re dominating beach time with snacks and SPF. But there\u2019s one last thing that\u2019s going to make you a refreshment renegade: rosewater face mist. Rosewater has soothing, anti-inflammatory properties, and is also great at removing oil and dirt (which can accumulate as you sweat). Plus, it\u2019s oh-so refreshing when you need a quick beach boost.Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
