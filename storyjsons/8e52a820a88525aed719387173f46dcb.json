Need I say more?By Emily SchultzDecember 5, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Christine DongFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.For me, travel = lots of eating. Whenever I touch down in a new city, I eat second breakfasts like a hobbit and leave my pants unbuttoned. So after a weekend of non-stop eating during Feast Portland, a food festival in\u2014you guessed it\u2014Portland, Oregon, a couple months ago, naturally, I had plans for where I\u2019d eat my last meal before flying back to New York City. It would be the restaurant everyone couldn\u2019t stop talking about at Feast: Gado Gado.As I rolled into the vibrant new Southeast Asian restaurant with my carry-on, I knew exactly what I would be ordering. I didn\u2019t do my usual \u201cone of everything on the menu\u201d since I was dining solo (there\u2019s only so much my body can take!). I got the thing the Rice Wizard herself (a.k.a. Carla Lalli Music) told me to order: the beef cheek coconut curry with flaky Malaysian roti in place of the rice. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I love a good bowl of steamed white rice, and so does Carla (see here, here, here, and here). But I came for the roti, and Carla did not lead me astray. The bread worked double time, as an edible shovel for pull-aparty pieces of tender beef cheek and a bready mop to sop up all of that aromatic, rich curry.What makes Gado Gado\u2019s roti so special lies in the lamination process. According to chef Thomas Pisha-Duffly, the roti canai you\u2019d find at a hawker\u2019s stand in Malaysia is typically folded four times into a diamond shape. This creates those buttery layers\u2014or in the case of traditional Malaysian roti, margarine-y layers\u2014like you would get with a biscuit or croissant. Gado Gado takes that a step further: After folding the dough the usual four times, they fold the dough onto itself about four more times until it reforms into a ball. Once the ball rests overnight, it\u2019s then rolled out and fried in rice grain oil to order. The result is an almost translucent bread that shingles off into a million layers of fried perfection with each bite. Which is exactly what I needed before my six-hour red-eye flight. Well, maybe that and a juice cleanse.Go there: Gado GadoExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsPortland OregonSoutheast AsianRead MorerestaurantsI Fully Endorse Tipsy Wine Shopping at Bar NormanBy Amiel StanekRecipes you want to make.
