But that\u2019s all about to change, thanks to food director Carla Lalli Music\u2019s new Instant Pot ribs recipe. Not only do they come together in a flash, but they\u2019re glazed with a sticky, spicy-sweet sauce that you\u2019ll lick right off your fingers\u2014because you\u2019ll be eating with them.Any pressure cooker (stovetop, electric, Instant Pot, or other brand of multicooker) will do for this recipe. You\u2019re just speeding up the pre-cook process before they hit the grill. Instead of going low-and-slow in the oven for hours, the ribs get tender in nine minutes under high pressure. To pack in as much flavor as possible, the ribs are dry-rubbed with Chinese hot mustard powder (or regular mustard powder, like Colman\u2019s, which will have a little less bite), garlic powder, sugar, and salt. They can hang out for as little as an hour or up to 48 if you want to prep them the night before or in the morning before you go to work. The four pounds of ribs in this recipe will serve four people as a main dish, or more if you end up making them for a BBQ and put them out alongside other grilled meats, burgers, and hot dogsThe next layer of flavor come from using mirin at the bottom of the Instant Pot to steam the ribs. This sweet Japanese rice wine will help balance out the spicy mustard powder and the Sriracha in the glaze. After the meat is done pressure cooking, it will be tender but not quiiiiite fall-off-the-bone, meaning you can grill it without it falling apart and easily pick it up to eat.But the moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for is the glaze. After reducing the mirin-and-pork-infused juices from the Instant Pot with ginger, Sriracha, white vinegar, fish sauce, and sugar into a syrupy glaze, slather it on the ribs, grill, and repeat. (If you don\u2019t have a grill, you can also broil the ribs, but keep an eye on them so the sugar doesn\u2019t scorch.) The sugars will caramelize until the ribs are dark brown, and the salty-spicy-sweet glaze will make the whole thing glisten. This sauce doesn\u2019t skew too sweet or too spicy: it\u2019s perfectly balanced. It\u2019s sticky enough that you have an excuse to lick it off your fingers instead of using a stack of napkins, and you can say you\u2019re saving the environment at the same time.This crunchy slaw will go greaaaat with ribs.\nBecause these ribs are spicy and fatty, they are best served with a crunchy slaw, a chewy grain salad, or anything bright and refreshing. Any of your standard BBQ sides will do. And if this sauce isn\u2019t speaking to you, listen closer. Just kidding\u2014any ribs recipe can be converted to this pressure-cooker-then-grill method (like our best-ever barbecue ribs), so feel free to change up the rub and sauce to whatever you\u2019re in the mood for. Weeknights will never be the same again.Get the recipe:Instant Pot Glazed and Grilled RibsTender, succulent ribs that spent 9 minutes under pressure and then hit the grill.
