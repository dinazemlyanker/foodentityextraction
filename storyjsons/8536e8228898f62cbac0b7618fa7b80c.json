But have you ever stopped to ask: Where does vanilla extract come from? Or, wait a minute, what even is vanilla? We\u2019ve got answers for you\u2014like, newsflash, vanilla beans aren\u2019t beans at all\u2014below. Let\u2019s begin:For starters, what is vanilla?To understand vanilla extract, you\u2019ve got to know the basics about vanilla. First off, a vanilla bean is no bean\u2014it\u2019s actually the fruit of orchids in the genus Vanilla. Those vanilla orchids only grow in a very small subsection of the world, with Madagascar producing a whopping 80%. Every step of the labor-intensive harvesting process\u2014from the pollination to the harvest to the curing (that is, the transformation of fat green vanilla\u00a0pods into skinny black beans)\u2014is done by hand! For all of these reasons, the demand greatly exceeds the supply, hence vanilla\u2019s standing as the world\u2019s second most expensive spice (around $270 a lb.), behind saffron.\u00a0Not a bean.\nPhoto by Laura MurrayWhole vanilla beans are a splurge, so you\u2019ll want to pick the plumpest, freshest ones available. Look for whole beans that are fat, shiny, and moist. While Madagascar produces approximately half of the world's crop, vanilla also comes from Mexico, French Polynesia, Uganda, China, and Indonesia, among other countries, and will have different flavor profiles depending on place of origin. Our test kitchen loves the incredibly fragrant and responsibly-harvested products from Heilala Vanilla, which come from the Kingdom of Tonga in the South Pacific.\u00a0But why is vanilla a prized addition? What does it bring to the table? The comforting flavors in vanilla (toasty, musky, floral, or even smoky and earthy) enhance nearly any dessert, making it endlessly versatile. Its caramelly richness makes warm, deep flavors\u2014coffee, chocolate, hazelnut, brown butter, and cinnamon\u2014cozier and bright flavors\u2014like citrus, hibiscus, rosemary, and berry\u2014sharper and more pronounced.I have a vanilla bean. Now what do I do?To get to the seeds of the bean, use a paring knife to make a slit down the pod\u2019s length, leaving the bottom intact. Open the sides like shutters to expose the grainy insides. Pressing gently, drag the flat side of the knife down the pod, gathering the seeds as you go. Then you\u2019re ready to drop it into whatever sweet treat you\u2019re cooking up.\u00a0To store unused vanilla beans, wrap them up tightly in plastic wrap or reusable Bee's Wrap, and then place in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to six months.Where does vanilla extract come from?Vanilla extract\u2014the kind that explicitly says \u201cpure vanilla extract\u201d on its label\u2014is made by soaking vanilla beans in an alcohol solution to \u201cextract\u201d (get it?) all of their flavor compounds. According to the FDA, vanilla extract must be at least 35% alcohol with a minimum of 100 grams of vanilla beans per liter. When you\u2019re shopping for high-quality extract, check the ingredients: It should only list vanilla beans, alcohol, and water, with no additives like sugar or artificial colors or flavors.\u00a0Photo by Chelsie CraigPure Vanilla Extract$29.97 at Heilala VanillaOr, make your own extract at home with vanilla beans and high-proof liquor like bourbon, vodka, or rum. You can store extract, whether store-bought or homemade, in a cool, dark place almost indefinitely.Where does imitation vanilla come from?\u00a0Ninety-nine percent of the world\u2019s vanilla extract is fake imitation vanilla that\u2019s not a product of the plant itself. Instead, it's flavored primarily with synthetic vanillin (a lab-produced version of the same\u00a0chemical compound that occurs naturally in real vanilla). Typically labeled as \u201cvanilla essence,\u201d this artificial vanilla is usually derived from, uh, less-than-organic material (like petroleum). While it mimics vanilla\u2019s smell, many would argue that it doesn\u2019t come close to capturing all of the complex floral and woodsy notes that result from the myriad of other flavor compounds in true vanilla.\u00a0This isn't to say that imitation vanilla doesn't have a purpose! It\u2019s the way more economical choice, and you might not even be able to detect it as an imposter in desserts that are packed with lots of other flavorful ingredients or in baked goods that spend a significant time in the oven. Some new-classic desserts\u2014think confetti cake and Dunkaroos\u2014rely on imitation vanilla for their distinct wallop of big vanilla flavor. The real extract can't accomplish the same job!\u00a0For sweets with pared-down ingredient lists or that come together over low heat or without any heat (like puddings, custards, pastry cream, no-bake desserts, whipped cream), however, the difference will likely be more pronounced. \u00a0What\u2019s this about beaver butts?When it comes to imitation vanilla, there\u2019s a whooole lot of\u00a0talk about beaver anal glands. Beaver castoreum (the goo-like vanilla-scented secretion that comes from beavers\u2019 castor sacs, located, yes, in close proximity to their anal glands) has been used as a food additive for much of the last century. It\u2019s recognized as safe by the FDA and could, in theory, sneak onto ingredients lists under the label of \u201cnatural flavorings.\u201d But the truth is you\u2019re actually not likely to encounter it in your desserts. Global production is extremely limited, and it\u2019s more commonly found in perfumes and cosmetics. When it comes to your average supermarket purchases, there\u2019s no need to fret: Nearly all vanilla extracts are vegan\u2014even the imitation ones.\u00a0What other forms does vanilla come in?\u00a0While extract and whole beans are among the most popular sources of vanilla flavor, they\u2019re not the only ones out there. You can also purchase vanilla in the form of vanilla bean paste. A combination of vanilla bean seeds, extract, sugar, and natural gum thickeners, it gives you those classic speckles for a fraction of the price as whole beans.\u00a0Vanilla Bean Paste$15 at Amazon$19.47 at HeilalaVanilla powder is less common and less versatile, but good for dry mixes like homemade pancake mix or dry rubs\u2014it\u2019s made from dried vanilla beans ground into a fine powder.Can I use vanilla extract if a recipe calls for vanilla bean?We get it. You\u2019re tempted to swap out a pricey vanilla bean for the (slightly) more economical vanilla extract. But sometimes the seeds are worth it. When vanilla is the sole flavor and those signature flecks will be in the spotlight (think pudding, ice cream, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, shortbread), splurge and buy the bean or use paste. But when vanilla is a backdrop to the star elements (in spice cookies, chocolate cake, and fruit pie filling, for example), save a buck and go with extract.How do I convert between extract, paste, and beans?As a general rule of thumb, 1 Tbsp. pure vanilla extract =one 6-inch vanilla bean = 1 Tbsp. vanilla bean paste. (But check your vanilla paste bottle, as some brands may vary!)Is there anything I can do with the spent pods?That scraped-out pod still holds a ton of flavor. So after you\u2019ve used the seeds, rinse the pod, let it air dry, then put it to use. Bury it in a bag of sugar, then use that vanilla sugar for all-purpose baking, or bury it in a jar of salt, then use it to finish cookies and brownies. Add it to the pot when you\u2019re making poached fruit or a compote, simmer it with sugar and water for a flavorful simple syrup, steep it in milk for vanilla-flavored custard, or drop it in a bottle of whiskey and reap the rewards.Chocolate + Vanilla = A Match Made In HeavenBlack-and-White ConchasWhy have a chocolate- or vanilla-flavored concha when you can have both in this New York\u2013inspired twist on the classic Mexican sweet bread?View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingVanillaVanilla ExtractRecipes you want to make.
