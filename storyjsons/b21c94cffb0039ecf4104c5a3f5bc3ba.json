The stuffed jujubes are poached in a simple syrup infused with dried osmanthus flowers, which have a floral, honey-like aroma and are often used in teas and desserts. The resulting cute little treats have a subtle sweetness and a satisfyingly chewy texture. They\u2019re a simple dessert to make for a festive occasion and have only four ingredients. Jujubes and dried osmanthus flowers can be found at Asian grocery stores, in local Chinatowns, and online. \u2014Jessie YuChenSee Jessie\u2019s recipes for Mushroom YouFan and Jessie's Special Steamed Whole Fish to complete your Lunar New Year feast, and read about their favorite Lunar New Year traditions here.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Place pits in a medium saucepan; set aside. Set jujubes aside separately.Step 2Combine 6 Tbsp. mochiko (sweet rice flour) and 3 Tbsp. room-temperature water in a medium bowl and mix and press with your hands until a dough forms. Form dough into small balls that are slightly smaller than your jujubes (about 1 tsp. or \u00bd\" in diameter), then gently roll balls into fat cylinders. Place a cylinder in the center of each reserved jujube, gently pressing sides to ensure good contact between dough and jujube. (Extra dough can be made into little mochi balls and cooked in syrup.)Step 3Place \u00bd cup raw sugar or light brown sugar, \u00bd tsp. dried osmanthus flower, and 2 cups water in reserved saucepan with pits (using the pits here will add more jujube flavor to the syrup). Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and let simmer until sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Add stuffed jujubes and reduce heat. Simmer gently, adjusting heat as needed, until jujubes float to the surface and mochi is slightly puffed, 10\u201313 minutes. Remove from heat; fish out and discard pits.Step 4Immediately arrange stuffed jujubes on a plate or in a shallow bowl. Drizzle syrup over and top with more dried osmanthus flower. (For a cold and chewier treat, combine jujubes and syrup in an airtight container, cover, and chill at least 20 minutes and up to 2 days.)How would you rate Mochi-Stuffed Jujubes (Soft Hearts)?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkExplore Bon App\u00e9titDessertFruit DessertEasyVeganDairy-FreeNut-FreeChineseEast AsianAsianShanghainese5 Ingredients or FewerGlutinous Rice FlourFlourDateDried FruitFruitLunar New YearRecipes you want to make.
