I took heed of advice from some commenters below. 1. Don't lower the temp half way through. 2. Cook the fish for 14 minutes. 3. Add Pomegranate seeds to your tapenade! 4. I personally added paprika to the fries, so so so good!. Overall the fish somehow lacked flavor without adding much more than suggested seasoning but the fries...wowza. A must make.HalleSeattle, Washington2/19/2021The olive mix really makes this whole dish. Like others I had to cook the fish a bit longer and found it's flavor to be pretty bland. This may have something to do with the quality of my zataar. Next time I think I will add extra sumac and marinate the fish for 30 minutes ahead of baking. The suggestion below of adding golden raisins to the tapenade sounds delish as well! All in all, it was a very simple, quick, and tasty recipe.FawnSanta Fe, NM2/2/2021Great tasting dinner tonight. Have recommended this to my daughter. DGBFort Myers, FL1/23/2021Agree with not throwing out the vinegar just to re-add it.\n\nI added a good amount of pomegranate seeds to the olive mixture and it really brightened up the whole dish.  My girlfriend thought that was her favorite part.AnonymousUSA1/5/2021Why throw out the 2 Tbsp of vinegar used to marinate the onions, only to add 2 Tbsp back in? Does the vinegar get too onion-y?cheflo2Seattle6/12/2020What a great healthy way to eat fish and chips! As one other reviewer mentioned, it did take longer to cook, especially the fish. The recipe calls for one piece, but I think that it would cook more consistently with smaller loins. Dublin OH5/28/2020I followed the recipe exactly as written and I must say...WOW! If you are a fan of Middle-Eastern flavors, then this will surely please you. The za'atar gave a wonderful flavor to the fish, but eating a bite along with a bit of the creamy potato and the cool minty olive mixture together was a flavor explosion! I served the fish on top of a bed of raw baby spinach, which went really well with the dish. The heat of the fish wilted the spinach ever so slightly, which was perfect. Paired with a 2013 Ferrari-Carano Fum\u00e9 Blanc, the meal was truly restaurant quality. I look forward to making this again!AnonymousThe Quiet Corner of CT4/27/2020Used sweet potatoes instead of Yukon gold. Other than that sub, went by the fecipe.  Will keep working on this recipe with various fish.(salmon comes to mind).\nWill add thinly sliced zucchin, cauliflower and/or broccoli florets to the quick pickled onions next time. Just to see.\n\nBachelor (party of one)Christchurch New Zealand3/5/2020I've made this several times now. The cook times listed seem to be a bit short for both the potatoes and the fish. I've been chucking cauliflower trees in with the potatoes which is delicious. The onion-olive topping is by far the highlight of this recipe. Annie CVirginia3/4/2020wasn\u2019t a fan of the fish with that seasoning! the potatoes were yummy but nothing transcendent.nyc3/1/2020Made this past weekend and loved it!! I sliced the potatoes thinner to cook them faster. Absolutely loved the bright fresh flavors of the olives and mint. Definitely will be adding to my repertoire HannahWhite2020Atlanta2/26/2020Don't skip the olive-onion-mint topping! It's fantastic with the cod, and brightens up this dish immensely for the amount of effort it takes. I really love these kinds of recipes - simple short ingredients list, and a method you can get the jist of with a skim. Honestly can't fault this it's such a ridiculously easy and yummy dinner.WillowkatIreland1/15/2020Delicious! Loved the way the potatoes \u201csouffl\u00e9d\u201d and the cod was perfectly cooked with the recipe method. Not sure if you\u2019d call the olive/onion mixture a tapenade or a salsa, but a great complement to the potatoes and cod.
