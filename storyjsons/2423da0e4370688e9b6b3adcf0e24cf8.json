It belongs to brothers and chefs Max and Eli Sussman, and pre-pandemic, they used it to promote Samesa, their shawarma restaurant in New York City, and other projects. But when restaurants shut down last March and Eli had some time on his hands, he started creating and posting memes in his Instagram stories that found a way to laugh at the haphazard, ruinous end of the restaurant industry as we knew it. A little cloud broke in the always thundering internet sky and eked out some light upon us all.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.A raging semitruck is about to crush a guy on a dinky red motorcycle.The truck [landlords/second wave/total economic collapse]The guy on the motorcycle [biz owners]The motorcycle [PPP]Eli was that guy on the motorcycle. Samesa\u2019s landlord was unwilling to give them a break, and the restaurant had to close permanently last year on September 27, 12 days after that post.\u201cI think [the memes] were articulating my confusion and anger and frustration over, at first, maybe my own personal situation with the restaurant,\u201d Eli told me, \u201cbut it mirrored so many other people\u2019s situations too.\u201d At least 110,000 people. That\u2019s how many restaurants closed in 2020, according to the National Restaurant Association. Meanwhile, Max was launching a pizza pop-up\u2014it\u2019s incredible, by the way\u2014in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The memes are (mostly) all Eli, with input from Max. Eli told me he spends around 30 to 40 minutes a morning making them.Memes that cover: the government absolutely abandoning restaurants during the pandemic, Tom Colicchio saving the day, stoner line cooks having existential conversations about Japanese knives, shitty customers tipping badly and spouting mask-less orders (pre-vaccine), porters keeping the restaurant from complete and utter destruction every night, the mythmaking and megalomania of Michelin-chasing fancy-boy chefs, LOTS of Die Hard references, Eleven Madison Park going vegan, getting reservations at Carbone, the futility of the restaurant industry, and how messy cocoa powder is.It\u2019s brilliant. Absurd. Deranged. Goofy. Wonderful. Do yourself a favor and spend a few minutes that will inevitably turn into an hour watching his saved Instagram stories. Let the memes wash over you like an industrial sanitizing Hobart dishwasher.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.As the memes took off and 5,000 more people began following the account, Eli started getting DMs from chefs, servers, dishwashers along the lines of \u201cI feel seen.\u201d\u201cI was trying to just provide a bit of levity in an incredibly stressful situation,\u201d Eli said. \u201cEveryone in the world was probably the most stressed-out they\u2019ve been this past year or so. And so, at the most simplistic level, I was just trying to have a little bit of fun and hoping that people would read them and think, Oh, this is a nice distraction from my incredibly shitty day.\u201dInstagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Thank you, Eli, it is a nice distraction from several shitty days. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019s giving himself enough credit. Humor is a hell of a medicine, and it was hard to find last year. Someone reminding you that life is absurd and silly\u2014even when it\u2019s incomprehensibly terrible\u2014can pull you out of a quicksand grief trap.\u201cIt has been very therapeutic for me to make them,\u201d Eli admitted.He gets meme ideas, check-ins from friends (\u201care you\u2026okay?\u201d), and fan mail in his DMs now. \u201cThere have been people that\u2019ve been in toxic workplaces, or they\u2019ve had a year where they maybe lost their job, or they had to work all through the pandemic, and they had DM\u2019d me and said, \u2018I like waking up every morning and scrolling through your memes. It makes me realize why I like being a part of this crazy industry\u2014or why I decided to leave this crazy industry.\u2019\u201dI also sense, at the core of the memes, a narrator whispering: This is a brutal, often terrible industry with razor-thin profit margins, sexual harassment, classist hierarchy, unreliability, low wages, awful hours, and physically taxing conditions. Run away.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\u201cI would say enter at your own risk, but try to gather as much information as you can first and see if this is really, actually how you want to be spending several years to the rest of your life,\u201d said counselor Eli. \u201cThe point [of the memes] isn\u2019t to demonize everyone and everything in the entire industry, but it is really hard when you think about how much easier your life would be if you didn\u2019t go into this industry.\u201dAnd yet.\u201cI love restaurants more than anything. I also take myself too seriously and treat this hospitality, restaurant world as my religion. A lot of [the memes] are just making fun of myself. I have Japanese knives, and I probably spent too much time thinking about them and talking about them. I definitely really care about what font restaurants use on their menus. I\u2019ve had discussions about how menus are not cohesive and don\u2019t make sense from start to finish, and how certain places tell a story with their menu and others don\u2019t. I subscribe to all of this stuff that I\u2019m mocking.\u201dSometimes followers DM the account to guess which xanthan gum\u2013loving chef a meme is referring to. Eli replies: \u201cNo, that\u2019s me.\u201d@thesussmans gets to make fun of some restaurant world news in a way we can\u2019t here in the ramp-and-rhubarb-obsessed food media (also made fun of in good measure on the account, thank God). When Eleven Madison Park announced it was going completely vegan, the news folk covered it pretty straightforward, Wow, wouldya look at that. @thesussmans posts: \u201cEMP goes meatless. Sous chefs be like: N-U-T-R-I-T-I-O-N-A-L Y\u2026.\u201d (Image: The chef is googling \u201cnutritional yeast.\u201d) I loved that one.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.After another story broke about a chef accused of sexual harassment, @thesussmans had the perfect meme: a huge house fire with a guy tossing a beach bucket of water on it. \u201cSocial, economic, gender, and racial disparities and issues within the hospitality industry\u201d [the fire] \u201cWe\u2019re going to commit ourselves to try a lot harder\u201d all-staff emails from management [the puny bucket of water]. Bleak, but true. Eli followed up that meme with a guy facing an exploding five-pound bag of cocoa powder for balance.Memes don\u2019t pay the bills, though, and unless @thesussmans got a sweet Fashion Nova sponsorship, Eli was still a restaurateur. After months of wondering what he\u2019d do next, Eli was able to resurrect Samesa in a prime lunch spot in Rockefeller Center, which opened this spring. On Instagram, he\u2019ll post the occasional food porny chicken schwarma wrap or one of Max\u2019s pizzas.\u201cI\u2019m trying to get people to remember that, yeah, I make memes, but I own a restaurant and it would be so cool if you came and ate food there,\u201d he said. I wondered if he saw any customers who came in because of the memes. \u201cI would not say that Samesa is experiencing an uptick in business due to the memes. That would be great. People definitely haven\u2019t been swinging by to see the memes in person.\u201d I think there\u2019s still time.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsInstagramCultureRecipes you want to make.
