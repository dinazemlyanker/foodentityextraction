It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.I like to say that Bon App\u00e9tit is only as good as its recipes. But that doesn\u2019t mean I never veer from the script.Let me explain.I was at a farm stand butcher on Saturday and I spied some real nice looking pork shoulder\u2014all rolled and tied up, streaked with milky white intramuscular fat.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!I knew I had to buy some; I just wasn\u2019t sure what to do with it. Slowly braising or smoking it wasn\u2019t in the cards because of time constraints. But then I remembered a BA video that just went live of Carla Lalli Music grilling up Gochujang pork shoulder steaks.Carla Makes Pork Shoulder Steaks\nThe recipe is chef Rachel Yang\u2019s, from a Korean BBQ primer we did a few years back. In Korea, meats that most Americans typically think of as braising cuts\u2014brisket, short rib, pork shoulder\u2014are sliced relatively thin, often marinated, and then quickly grilled over medium high heat, yielding richly flavorful and exceptionally juicy results.So that\u2019s what I was going to make. Done deal. Except I didn\u2019t have Gochujang, the Korean hot chile paste. Nor did I have the sake or mirin the recipe called for.But I did have four gorgeous 3/4-inch pork shoulder steaks. So instead of Gochujang, I bought a bottle of the farm\u2019s house-made sriracha. (Not the same as Gochujang, but it also offers a spicy-sweet, fermenty hit.) Back home, I knew I had the called-for ginger and garlic. I also had a fridge full of ros\u00e9, which is neither mirin nor sake, but hey, they\u2019re all wine.So I hodge-podged together my take on the marinade, intensely fragrant and potent. I fired up my charcoal Weber, and I grilled a version of Rachel\u2019s Gochujang pork shoulder steaks \u2018till super crispy and still juicy at the center, just as Carla had shown me.They were amazing. Not exactly what Bon App called for, but that\u2019s okay in my book. What matters is that you take from a recipe the key technique or essential ingredient (in this case grilling a braising cut and seasoning it aggressively) and then make it your own. Because, really, the most important thing is that you make it.Get the recipe:Gochujang Pork Shoulder SteaksThe centerpiece of Korean barbecue is the meat, but it doesn't have to be steak.View RecipeRecipes you want to make.
