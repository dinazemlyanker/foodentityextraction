This stuff is eat by the spoonful delicious!  It is a staple in my diet.  Calorie counting?  Just exercise!  Yummy!Dolly's MomTiny town Mi5/5/2021Doreen, shut up with your diet culture crap, if you care about calorie count why are you even here?! You clearly don't enjoy food, go back to calorie counting and leave the rest of us to actually cookeat_what_you_wantUK2/17/2021Looks interesting but what is the calorie count.  Must be thru the roof??DoreenWinnipeg Mb1/5/2021Just made this, it came out fantastic. I used cashew butter instead of almond butter, and used half the amount of coconut oil (adding in the oil from the top of the cashew butter.) Added extra pepper because I liked the spice. It came out fantastic and only took about 20 minutes to pull together. Really fantastic and layered flavor, and a recipe that I can see would be easy to mess around and experiment with. AnonymousOakland, CA1/2/2021Another BA hit!  I did not have Aleppo pepper and have substituted hot smoked paprika & red pepper flakes. I also add a few sunflowers seed to further up the crunch factor. Perfect!lismToronto, Ontario 4/26/2020I loved this the first time I made - in fact everyone else did too and ate it all!  Cut the oil to 5 Tbs this time and it seems runnier.....hum.  Still good but hard to keep on the breadcbickstAustin4/19/2020I agree with other reviewers that the amount of coconut oil can be a bit much. It ultimately comes down to how thick your almond butter is and how runny/spreadable you want the final product to be. I'd start with 2-3 Tlb and add more if necessary. Used crushed red pepper flakes because I don't have access to Aleppo peppers and it's a perfect mix of flavors and totally elevates my mid-afternoon snack of rice cakes and nut butter. El Salvador4/6/2020This is amazing and addictive. Eat it on bread, chocolate ice cream, or straight off your S/O\u2019s toes.\n\nHighly recommend. Toe-tally delicious!AnonymousToeronto, CA1/28/2020This seeded butter is ALMOST perfect. Flavor combinations are delish and the Aleppo is a great touch...7 tbsp of coconut oil is total overkill in my opinion- just doesn\u2019t need it. I cut it down to 3 tbsp and still felt like it was too much. Would 100% make again with 2 tbsp coconut oil. shayluhroseSyracuse, NY1/27/2020I made this power butter yesterday and WOW! I love nut butters, but this is amazing. I find myself eating it by the spoonful. The texture is amazing and the flavor delicious. I couldn\u2019t find Aleppo pepper at my local co op, so I replaced it with toasted coconut flakes. I know it\u2019s not exactly a substitute but that addition of coconut flavor and crunch elevated it! Such a good recipe!!! BonappetitfanaticMinneapolis, MN1/21/2020I replaced Aleppo with paprika and cayenne. This recipe is amazing with some bread, in yogurt for overnight oats or chia pudding. I used TJ's raw almond butter, which tends a little on the thicker side, and the seeds hold up really well in it.AnonymousLos Angeles1/19/2020I made this tonight - I love all nut butters so I was super excited for this recipe. While the flavor is amazing , I find the consistency too thin. Did anyone else have this problem? Wondering if I used too much oil or not enough almond butter. Does it thicken in the fridge? Anonymous1/19/2020Just made this for a midnight snack. Had it pre-cool down and it was amazing. Toasty, sweet, salty, and crunchy. Nom nom nom forever.AnonymousMinneapolis 1/18/2020Pretty delicious, though I can't stand the name! I only had chocolate almond butter and I used that along with some cashew butter. Brought it into work and people are going crazy for it! AnonymousDenver, CO1/14/2020I made this today and it's fantastic. I've never been a huge fan of natural almond butter (gasp!) because it's so dense but the coconut oil in this recipe lightens it up. Love everything about this except there's too much salt, I'd cut to 1/4 or 1/2 tsp.
