You know, the glaze based on a 200-year-old family recipe or the frosting that makes eating cupcakes a religious experience. My little secret comes in the form of a 2.64-ounce tin of smoked paprika. It\u2019s made by a brand called Chiquilin, and there is no piece of food I won\u2019t cover in this stuff. Scrambled eggs, chicken thighs, seafood stew\u2026 heck, I even pinched a dusting of this stuff on my chocolate ice cream to see if it would fly and baby it took off at a thousand miles-per-hour. It is, as the kids say, next-level.This particular variety of paprika originally comes from Spain and is part of Luis Penalva, SL, a family business that has specialized in herbs and seasonings since 1909. What separates it from the basic paprika you\u2019d find in a run-of-the-mill grocery store is the method by which it\u2019s prepared. The peppers are dried over a fire containing oak, allowing a deeply smoky flavor to come through without any preservatives or unnatural flavors.I\u2019ve always been a proponent for heavy paprika use and this innocuous little tin has helped me convert non-believers into paprika evangelists. It\u2019s bold without being overpowering and memorable without leaving a lasting taste in your mouth. When you bite into a piece of chicken spiced to the heavens with the deep red seasoning, you see your meal in a totally different light. Flavors you didn\u2019t know existed come out to party. It\u2019s the smokiness that really gets me though, making it a barbecue must-have.My shining achievement with Chiquilin happened just the other night when I made chicken marsala. Most recipes have you dredging your chicken in flour with a little bit of salt and pepper. I loaded my flour with two tablespoons of this paprika and dredged my chicken until it looked like an abandoned car after a blizzard. After frying up the meat and making the sauce, I began to worry about the smoky taste overpowering the sweetness of the marsala flavor. I was wrong. Dead wrong. What followed was one of the most delicious meals I have ever made in my life. I\u2019m not one for hyperboles, but this meal almost put me in a coma. And to think, I only bought this paprika because I like the way the tin looks.Forget everything you ever knew about spices and toss out your mild paprika in lieu of Chiquilin, or I will personally come to your house and raid your spice cabinet. My one constructive criticism is that the tin is hard to open, but I don\u2019t have any fingernails, so that may be why.Buy it: Chiquilin Smoked Paprika, $6 on AmazonSpeaking of chicken, here\u2019s a recipe that works every time:All products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
