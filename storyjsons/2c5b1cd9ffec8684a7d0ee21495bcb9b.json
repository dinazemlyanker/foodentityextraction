See our past recommendations here!Have you ever sipped ice-cold cucumber water on the beach, the sun heating the sand to a sultry 98 degrees? Or drank hibiscus sun tea on a subway platform so humid, it feels like standing in a mouth? Trust me: There is no greater pleasure. And when it's as hot as it's been in New York this summer, Welly\u2019s insulated bottle is my best weapon.Its BPA-free bottle is made from lightweight (but sturdy) bamboo, with a wide mouth to easily accommodate ice cubes or cucumber spears. The double-walled vacuum insulation is designed to keep drinks cold for 24 hours and hot for six hours\u2014while I\u2019ve never tested it for this long, I've never had a problem with lukewarm liquids in this bottle.When the temperature dips below 70 degrees, I fully plan on using the removable infuser to brew tea on the go. But for now I\u2019ll be filling my Welly bottle with something cold and delicious. And if the mood strikes to pour in a little ros\u00e9 sangria, no one will be the wiser \u2014Aliza Abarbanel, assistant editorBuy it: Welly Bamboo Water Bottle, $30All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
