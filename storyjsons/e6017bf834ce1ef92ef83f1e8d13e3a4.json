It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.It\u2019s time to master mashed potatoesThree more Mondays till Thanksgiving. And I\u2019ve already got mashed potatoes on my mind.We can banter all we want in the coming weeks about the merits of parsnip confit (check out the new recipe) and BA\u2019s famous shaved kale and Brussels salad, but I\u2019ve always believed that the big meal is about nailing the basics. And there is no dish more essential, more satisfying than a large bowl of buttery, creamy mashed potatoes.So let\u2019s get to it.Want this letter before it hits the website?

They not only lend an attractive golden hue to the finished product, but they deliver a richness that russet potatoes simply do not.Salt. When boiling your Yukons, be sure to add a generous amount of salt to the water. This will infuse your potatoes, all the way through, with flavor. If you don\u2019t adequately salt your water, you\u2019ll be futilely reaching for the shaker at the table.Moisture\u2014boo! After you drain your perfectly tender potatoes, return them to the still-hot pot. Shake them around to allow any excess moisture to steam off. You can even turn the stove on low to aid this process. Ultimately, you want creamy mashed potatoes, not watery ones.Photo by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiFlavorings. Yeah, no. This magazine and others, over the years, has called for everything from roasted garlic to horseradish. We\u2019ve asked you to infuse your milk or cream with fresh herbs. Which is fine, if you really want to. But perfect mashed potatoes don\u2019t need anything more than butter, salt, and cream. (Emphasis on the butter in our extra-buttery mashed potatoes recipe.) There will be so many flavors and competing dishes on the Thanksgiving table, your mashed potatoes should serve as the bedrock for the entire menu. So keep them basic, in the best possible way.Tools. Do you own a ricer or a food mill? You should. Both are old school and both get the job done. The former is like a giant garlic press, the latter like a hand-cranked food processor. (A food mill is pictured below!) Each produces miraculously fluffy and smooth mashed potatoes. Not a lump to be found.Alex LauMoisture\u2014yay! Chances are, if you\u2019re the organized type, you mashed your potatoes ahead of time. Smart move. But when you gently reheat them just before sitting down at the table, you\u2019re going to need to add some liquid to rehydrate them (they will have tightened up as they sat). So, either stir in some warmed milk and cream, or try adding some reserved potato water from the pot, all nice and salty and starchy. It does the trick.Watch how it\u2019s done. If you\u2019re the type who\u2019s a visual thinker, or you\u2019ve just got five minutes to kill, or you just really like mashed potatoes, watch the always-charming Andy Baraghani make flawless, ultra-creamy mashed potatoes in the BA Test Kitchen. Then get in yours and do it yourself.Now choose a mashed potato recipe:Extra-Buttery Mashed PotatoesMake-Ahead Mashed PotatoesUltra-Creamy Mashed PotatoesMashed Baked Potatoes with ChivesExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterMashed PotatoesThanksgivingPotatoRead MorerecipesOur 73 Best Potato Recipes, Just in Time for Carb SeasonGallery73 SlidesBy Mehreen Karimcooking7 Tips for the Best Mashed Potatoes of Your LifeBy Alex DelanycookingWhat\u2019s the Best Potato For Mashing?
