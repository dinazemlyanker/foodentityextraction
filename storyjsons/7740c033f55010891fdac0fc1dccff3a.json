Each ingredient has a corresponding auspicious greeting with it. This dish is usually served as an appetizer to raise good luck for the new year by everyone gathering around the dining table and raising their chopsticks to mix the ingredients of the salad together.\u201d Read more about Chinese New Year and find the full menu here.Ingredients8 servings\u00bccup plum sauce2Tbsp. low-sodium soy sauce1Tbsp. toasted sesame seeds1tsp.

Heat over medium-high and add 1 wonton strip (this will be your tester to ensure oil is hot). Once wonton begins to sizzle around the edges and starts to shrivel, the oil is hot enough (if you have a deep-fry thermometer, it should register around 350\u00b0).Step 3Working in batches, fry wonton strips until golden and crisp, 30\u201345 seconds. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain.Step 4Place salmon in the center of a large platter. Arrange cucumbers, pears, grapefruit, carrot, daikon, bell pepper, ginger, and fried wonton strips around salmon. Drizzle reserved sauce over and toss together with your guests before serving.How would you rate Prosperity Salad (Yusheng)?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkExplore Bon App\u00e9titSaladCantoneseChineseEast AsianAsianSalmonFishSeafoodAsian PearFruitDaikonVegetableEasyStarterSideDairy-FreeLunar New YearDinnerRecipes you want to make.
