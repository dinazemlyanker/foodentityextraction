Instead, a pickup truck appears curbside at the Bluegrass Airport in Lexington, Kentucky. Sure, it is silver, and it is a Honda, but it\u2019s also a full-blown pickup truck. The kind you see wobbling over rough terrain in television commercials, driven by burly men. Fore, noticing the surprise on my face, shrugs her shoulders and starts laughing. \u201cI am a Southern girl at heart, what can I say?\u201dFore, 36, is the chef and force behind the popular pop-up Tuk Tuk Sri Lankan Bites. She is based in Kentucky but travels around the country putting on dinners that showcase her upbringing as a child of both the American South and Sri Lankan immigrants. As an adult, certain terms slip out in Sinhalese first, English second, but get her excited and the thicker the gentle Southern drawl that punctuates her sentences becomes. Duke\u2019s mayonnaise and Crystal hot sauce are just as at home in her cupboard as spices like turmeric, cinnamon, pandan leaf, and cardamom.Sam Fore, in her home kitchen.\nPhoto by Brian KaiserThese two identities are the basis for Fore\u2019s pop-up concept, which serves a Sri Lankan menu cooked through a Southern lens. Curried deviled eggs, tomato pie made with a turmeric-spiked crust and tamarind onions, curry meatball sandwiches on Hawaiian rolls topped with onion chutney and coconut gravy are all staples of her menu. Her fried chicken comes with a buttermilk brine but also curry leaf salt. Shrimp spiced with turmeric and goraka (a sour fruit) powder are piled high on a base of coconut-milk-simmered grits for her riff on the classic combo.\u201cIf you think about the traditions of Southern cooking and the Southern table, they are very similar to Sri Lankan culture and the Sri Lankan table,\u201d she says of the combination. \u201cSouthern cooking is meant for large groups of people. Same with Sri Lankan food. These aren\u2019t just meant for one person.\u201d Fore is also quick to point out that there isn\u2019t just a cultural overlap, but shared ingredients and cooking techniques as well. \u201cOkra was one of my favorite vegetables growing up,\u201d she says. \u201cWhether that was okra curry or Southern fried okra.\u201d Beets and sorghum are common in both pantries too. She even mixes the stark white batter for appam, a fermented rice and coconut milk crepe, with the same technique that she uses to bring together pancake batter.\u201cMost people here aren\u2019t familiar with Sri Lankan food, and I want to change that,\u201d Fore says. \u201cWhat people really want from a culinary point of view is a common ground. So if I can relate my food to where I grew up, it\u2019s easier for people to accept. You have to give them a gateway.\u201d For Fore, her mission will be accomplished the day that sambol is as common as salsa.Chicken curry\nPhoto by Brian KaiserYou would never guess that Fore has zero professional culinary training, given the confidence and tranquility with which she cooks. I\u2019ve been sitting at the kitchen counter in the home she shares with her husband, Chris, and their brigade of pets (three dogs and two cats) for 30 minutes watching her calmly start on a fragrant pineapple curry\u2014only the second of a long list of dishes she\u2019ll be serving in just two hours. The rest of the menu is no less ambitious: Appam, which she will make to order; a jackfruit dish known as polos; chicken curry; a couple of sambols; and the same tomato pie that often shows up at her pop-up. She is also debating making ice cream, but luckily a dinner guest has offered to bring dessert.Dinner parties like this one, and the brunches she hosted too, are the foundation of her pop-up concept. When Fore moved back to Lexington from Boston in 2012, she whipped up epic monthly Sri Lankan spreads \u201cas a way to make friends,\u201d she admits with a laugh.Her mother FaceTimes in, scolding her for starting so late and reminding her to put salt in the appam batter. Fore rolls her eyes and hangs up, returning to her kitchen, which one could generously describe as \u201cchaotic.\u201d Fore is in the middle of packing up their current house before they move into a bigger space with her dream kitchen (in which she hopes to shoot Sri Lankan cooking videos), and shouts for Chris, asking him if he knows where the lid to the food processor is. Could it be in the garage? Or maybe they accidentally put it in storage. He eventually finds it in a corner cabinet. Fore has prepped nothing the day before, including the appam batter, which needs time to ferment. She throws the chicken she just diced into a crowded pan, even though she knows she \u201cisn\u2019t supposed to do that.\u201d \u201cIt just keeps the meat moist,\u201d she says with a sheepish grin.On the phone with Mom.\nPhoto by Brian KaiserHer methods would probably give any classically trained chef an aneurysm, but Fore\u2019s lack of formal training is actually a boon. It has allowed her to become a fearless cook, unafraid of bending tradition and unencumbered by stiff French culinary guidelines. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have any preconceived notions of what food is supposed to look like,\u201d says chef Meherwan Irani. Irani, who owns restaurants in Asheville (Buxton Hall, Chai Pani) and Atlanta (Botiwalla) is a member, alongside Fore, of Brown in the South, a roving dinner series that brings together South Asian chefs cooking in the southeastern United States. \u201cShe cooks without those restrictions. Her cooking is honest and homely\u2014not in a bad sense. She has elevated that to something I think a lot of food is going to move towards.\u201dFore\u2019s entry into the culinary world is atypical to say the least. She spent her college years in Boston, eventually getting a Masters of the Arts in Management from Harvard University Extension School. She graduated in 2010 at the height of the recession, making it practically impossible to get a job.One day she came across an article in the Boston Globe about how much chefs Jamie Bissonnette and Ken Oringer hated the website for their restaurant, Coppa. Though she had no experience building a website before, Fore and Chris (a web engineer and developer) won the bid to redo their site, which launched the couple\u2019s restaurant website building business\u2014something they still do for a handful of clients today.It was during this time that she realized that, while she had taught herself to cook everything from French to Italian food post-college, she didn\u2019t know how to cook the Sri Lankan dishes her mother made for her growing up, the dishes she really craved. So she decided to follow her mother around with a camera phone to capture her recipes, eventually writing them down for herself. Fore started to bat around the idea of opening a short eats place serving Sri Lankan drinking snacks, but it was far too expensive of an endeavor in Boston.Whipping up some saut\u00e9d greens\nPhoto by Brian KaiserFore and Chris relocated to Kentucky and continued with their website business, while Fore threw regular dinner parties and brunches. But their routine came to a pause when Chris was diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal cancer. \u201cI stopped cooking for other people and started cooking for him more\u2014curries packed with turmeric and other spices\u2014because I really believe in the combination of Western and Eastern medicine,\u201d she says quietly. It\u2019s the rare moment where her energy feels depleted, as if her blood is actually made of plasma and platelets and not Red Bull. \u201cI could have been a widow at 31.\u201dIn the spring of 2016, friends who owned a bar in Lexington but struggled to get a food truck to partner with them, approached Fore and asked if she could cook at the bar for an upcoming event, now that Chris was in full remission. She calculated the costs to purchase the three-sided tent and the ingredients she needed, and threw her first Tuk Tuk Sri Lankan Bites pop-up for a mere $572. She managed to make $750 that night, serving an affordable menu of Sri Lanka-meets-the-South bowls and snacks. (Dishes are rarely over $10 at her concept.)  \u201cI was like, Okay, this must be a one time thing,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut then I did it again, and I made over $700 again.\u201d Soon after, she got a call from chef Edward Lee (on the recommendation of Jamie Bissonette) who invited her to come up to Louisville and do a pop-up at his restaurant 610 Magnolia. From there, Tuk Tuk Sri Lankan Bites took off.Fore has since cooked everywhere from the Atlanta Food & Wine Festival to a takeover event at Chinese-American restaurant Mei Mei in Boston. She can now count everyone from food writer and editor John T. Edge to Padma Lakshmi as fans. Fore is also a regular fixture at the aforementioned popular Brown in the South dinners, which she says is integral to her success. \u201cI found a family,\u201d Fore says. \u201cThey are people who get my experiences.\u201d The dinner series has also allowed her to cook in places like Nashville, Raleigh, and Asheville, adding to her list of American cities getting access to Sri Lankan cuisine. Though for Fore, this is just the tip of the iceberg: She hopes to bring her pop-up to every corner of the country.Cashew curry\nPhoto by Brian KaiserFore\u2019s Lexington home is never empty, nor quiet. The door is open to the entire city, it seems, as if she were its culinary mayor. As she starts cooking the appam, her guests start to filter in: a local chef, a tattoo artist, a bartender, members of the tourism board. Also among them is fellow Lexington resident and popular cookbook author Stella Parks. \u201cSam knows everyone,\u201d she says with a laugh. Parks first met Fore through one of her famed dinner parties, which was also the first time she\u2019d tried Sri Lankan food. \u201cI had one bite and couldn\u2019t believe how delicious the flavors were,\u201d Parks said. In fact, for everyone attending, Fore\u2019s cooking was their introduction to Sri Lankan cooking.Nothing seems to faze Fore, whether it\u2019s the pressure of satisfying a room full of hungry people or her own experience of excruciating physical pain. The first couple of pop-up events took such a physical toll on her that she developed exertional compartment syndrome\u2014an exercise-induced muscle and nerve condition\u2014that required surgery. She has since healed, but even that couldn\u2019t slow her down on her mission to get America to fall in love with the flavors of her heritage.Can\u2019t make her beet curry without turmeric.\nPhoto by Brian KaiserLooking ahead, she hopes to host more Tuk Tuk Lex pop-ups around the country and aspires to write a cookbook and perhaps even host a television show. Fore is also looking for a more permanent spot in Lexington, though she has no plans to open a traditional restaurant. \u201cI never want a restaurant to be my full-time gig,\u201d she admits. \u201cThere is just too much out there for me.\u201dIdeally, it would be more like a bar, where she could pop up whenever she wants and serve a menu that costs less than $30 to eat through. \u201cI want everyone to be able to come and try out my food,\u201d she says.She also wants the bar to have a space where other local cooks can incubate new and diverse ideas\u2014affordably. \u201cI would have killed for a space like this when I was first starting up,\u201d she says. At the end of the day, she wants to build an inclusive community, something she hasn\u2019t always been able to find. \u201cInclusion means not just having a seat at the table, but flipping the table itself,\u201d she says. \u201cTo have a seat, you have to fit yourself into molds, and play by the rules. I will always refuse to do that.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titChefsRestaurantsRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
