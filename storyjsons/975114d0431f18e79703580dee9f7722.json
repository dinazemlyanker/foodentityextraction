Every day in December I would carefully open a perforated flap in the cardboard box, revealing a quarter-size milk chocolate shaped like a bell or star or present. Hell if I knew what advent was (still pretty unclear, tbh), but that monthlong tease was something I looked forward to all year. As an adult my tastes have matured, which means I\u2019ve branched out beyond milk chocolate to advent calendars featuring black licorice, loose-leaf teas, and experimental truffles. Pee-Wee remains nonnegotiable.Below you\u2019ll find some of the best advent calendars for 2021\u2014and they are, no joke, selling out as I file this, so if one catches your eye, don\u2019t sleep on it. If these best sellers are out of stock, allow me to point you to Cost Plus World Market (12 Days of Hot Sauces), Food 52 (we haven't forgotten about you, Hanukkah observers), and\u2014if beauty and skin care are your vices\u2014Sephora, all of which have great selections.Harry Potter Advent CalendarIf you\u2019ve got a kid (or if you yourself are that kid) who can\u2019t get enough of those Christmas scenes at Hogwarts, this Williams-Sonoma Harry Potter candy advent calendar is right up your Diagon Alley. You\u2019ll find Fizzing Whizbees, gummi slugs, and, of course, Bertie Bott\u2019s Every Flavour Beans. While I didn\u2019t get a booger jelly bean, I did eat something that tasted decidedly of mulch. Fun for the whole family?Harry Potter Advent Calendar$80 at Williams SonomaDelysia Chocolate Truffle Advent CalendarNicole Patel\u2019s truffles sound gimmicky; the Austin chocolatier is known for flavors like Thanksgiving Stuffing and Smoked Brisket. I\u2019d dismiss Delysia as catering to the booger-jelly-bean crowd except that Patel\u2019s flavors actually work\u2014and they\u2019re rooted in real-life holiday treats. Her chocolate advent calendar features a five by five grid of numbered truffles, each inspired by a different festive dish from around the world. That includes warm-spiced standbys like figgy pudding and lebkuchen as well as more out-there flavors like fried chicken (peppery like a well-seasoned coating) and doro wat (chocolate and Berbere make a great combo, turns out).Delysia Chocolate Truffle Advent Calendar$75 at DelysiaVahdam Teas Advent CalendarFor all but the thirstiest tea drinkers, Vahdam\u2019s advent calendar is the gift that will keep on giving long after December is over. Each day you\u2019ll unbox a different tin containing 17 grams of loose-leaf black, green, or herbal tea\u2014more than enough for multiple servings. Most are blends (the several varieties of chai are my favorite), but for the purists you\u2019ll find first flush Darjeeling, oolong, and Assam as well. My Christmas countdown calendar oddly skipped December 20 and contained two December 22\u2019s\u2014which I didn\u2019t mind since that meant a double portion of Vahdam\u2019s deliciously floral rose black tea.Vahdam Teas Advent Calendar$80 $68 at Vahdam Teas$70 at AmazonBonne Maman Advent CalendarIf jam is your jam, Bonne Maman\u2019s holiday advent calendar is back, and it is an absolute delight. Each day you\u2019ll be rewarded with a one-ounce jar of fruit spreads, magically transforming your house into a charming bed and breakfast. There\u2019s a lone jar of honey tucked away behind a closed door as well. The flavors are a cut above your standard grocery store offerings\u2014there\u2019s peach with jasmine, sweet orange and passion fruit, and fig with cardamom, the appropriate descriptor of which is, I believe, \u201cscrummy.\u201dBonne Maman Advent Calendar$35 at AmazonMcCrea\u2019s Caramels Advent CalendarIf you\u2019re chocolated out, check out this Christmas advent calendar of individually wrapped caramels hidden behind a wintry anthropomorphic street scene featuring a hamster with a tambourine. Massachusetts-based McCrea\u2019s Candies makes caramels that strike just the right balance between meltingly soft and jaw-achingly firm in both classic (maple and chocolate peppermint) and more unconventional (rosemary sea salt and cinnamon clove) flavors. My only quibble is that the packaging is a little finicky; several of the caramels dislodged from their divots, so I had to dig around to find all the goodies.McCrea\u2019s Caramels Advent Calendar$38 at Food52$38 at Uncommon Goods24 Beers of CheerIt\u2019s a bit of a stretch to call this a \u201ccalendar,\u201d but a case of beers by any other name tastes as sweet. Inside the box are craft offerings from the likes of Golden Road Brewing, Goose Island, Elysian, and Kona Brewing Co. The cans run the gamut of styles and ABVs, from a thirst-quenching 4% mango wheat beer to an imperial IPA from Seattle\u2019s Redhook Brewery that clocks in at 8.6%. Depending on whether you prefer DIPAs or sours, you probably won\u2019t love all 24 beers equally, so I recommend getting some friends together and crushing the calendar in one go.24 Beers of Cheer$68 at ReserveBarLakrids Danish Licorice Advent CalendarFor freaks like me 24 days of Christmas licorice is the best holiday gift imaginable. Danish brand Lakrids by B\u00fclow is one of my all-time favorite candy companies, and its countdown calendar does not disappoint. Hidden behind each door is an individually wrapped two-pack (one for me, one for also me) of chocolate-coated licorice in flavors like salted caramel, strawberries and cream, and vanilla mango. These little-sweet-little-salty crunchy-shelled marble-size balls might convert even avowed licorice haters\u2014but if not, more for you.Lakrids Danish Licorice Advent Calendar$55 at Food52Sugarfina Santa\u2019s Workshop Advent CalendarThis candy collection\u2019s packaging is among the best of the bunch. Little boxes decorated to look like envelopes peep out from behind the cellophane windows of Santa\u2019s workshop. Inside each you\u2019ll find plenty of gummies, both sour and sweet. There are a few chocolates as well, but this calendar is definitely for the person who opts for Sour Patch Kids over Reese\u2019s Pieces at the movie theater.Sugarfina Advent Calendar$55 at Neiman Marcus$55 at ReserveBarCoco Christmas Advent CalendarLike Vahdam\u2019s tea advent calendar, this offering from Scottish chocolatier Coco yields generous portions\u2014each day of the holiday countdown you can look forward to a beautifully wrapped mini bar of chocolate. Coco is all about investing in origin (meaning the places where cacao is actually grown), so its chocolate is made close to the source before being shipped to Scotland and crafted into flavors like salted caramel milk chocolate and Isle of Skye sea salt dark chocolate. This hefty calendar (over a pound of chocolate!) is decorated not with snowmen or caroling cats but with a bold, graphic pattern in black and white\u2014very nondenominational, very moderne.COCO Christmas Advent Calendar$75 at Food52$75 at FoxtrotMaison du ChocolatMost of the other entries on this list come in boxes of various shapes and sizes, but Maison du Chocolat\u2019s advent calendar looks like a volleyball-size Death Star. It features a loop at the top so you can hang it from your Christmas tree or dangle it juuuuust out of reach from children too young to appreciate fine French pralines and ganaches. You\u2019ll find a mix of milk and dark chocolates hidden behind each door. All are good, but the caramel ganaches are the best.La Maison du Chocolat$75 at La Maison du ChocolatExplore Bon App\u00e9titGift GuidesCultureShoppingRecipes you want to make.
