I drink it to be productive. But on a recent trip to Kyoto, after reading about how stellar the city\u2019s coffee scene was, I decided to be that person. You know, the kind who walks a mile or two for a good cup, cares about whether or not the beans are roasted in-house, and stalks Instagram to see where the locals go. Plus, I knew I was going to be jet lagged as hell and would need it. So I did some research (turns out Japan drinks a lot of coffee), starred a bunch of spots in my Google Maps, and got going. Here are the shops that served up A+ lattes, and brought me to neighborhoods I wouldn\u2019t have otherwise visited.I am a person who takes photos of their latte art now!\nPhoto by Rachel KartenWEEKENDERS COFFEEDown an alley, and through an hourly parking lot you\u2019ll find Weekenders Coffee. If you aren\u2019t looking for it, you won\u2019t find it. But after weaving through some parked cars, you\u2019ll see a white townhouse with its wooden door slid open to a small espresso bar. They roast their own beans (a thing I now care about), and use a La Marzocco for their espresso drinks (a thing I now kinda care about). It\u2019s right near the definitely-worth-visiting Nishiki Market, so plan to hit this spot before or after. But be advised: The coffee shop is closed on Wednesdays and there\u2019s limited seating.Yes, that's the view from the Arashiyama location of % Arabica.\nPhoto by Rachel Karten% ARABICAA small chain with 30 shops across 11 countries (and more in the works), I specifically sought out the location in Arashiyama. Sure it\u2019s a bit outside of the city, but it\u2019s nestled between the Arashiyama Mountains, Ooi River, and Togetsukyo Bridge, and to call it picturesque would be an understatement. There was a line out the door when I arrived at around 10 a.m. (it\u2019s near Tenry\u016b-ji, a UNESCO World Heritage temple, and the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove), and wins the award for \u201cMost Tourists\u201d out of all the coffee shops I visited. But the latte was great, and it properly fueled my day of weaving through selfie sticks.Dream picnic situation at Wife&Husband.\nPhoto by Rachel KartenWIFE&HUSBANDThis spot made me the kind of person who BIKES to a COFFEE SHOP, which feels pivotal to my rebrand as a \u201ccoffee person.\u201d The small shop, close to the Kamo River bike path, is Instagram famous (just look at it!) for renting out picnic kits (cute seating included) for customers to take to the nearby river. I opted against this and sat inside their tiny, antique-filled shop instead. The coffee (which they roast in-house) was amazing, but the cheese-and-honey milk bread toast I ordered along with it was one of the most delicious things I ate in Kyoto. Oh, and yes, it\u2019s owned by a husband-wife team.Walden Woods is a decidedly not-cozy coffee shop.\nPhoto by Rachel KartenWALDEN WOODSThe neighborhood around Walden Woods feels quiet and isolated, and for a moment you\u2019ll swear you missed it. But then you\u2019ll see it: A stark white shop that looks like an Apple store selling lattes. Bare and minimalist\u2014downstairs there\u2019s just the bar; upstairs there\u2019s cement, bleacher-like seating with no tables\u2014it\u2019s decidedly anti-cozy, but it serves a mean iced matcha latte.The matcha kakig\u014dri at Pass The Baton is a thing of beauty.\nPhoto by Rachel KartenPASS THE BATONThis is cheating, because I didn\u2019t actually get a latte here, but because this vintage store serves coffee and tea in small shop in front, it still counts. Instead, I showed up for the enormous matcha kakig\u014dri: a mountain of shaved ice topped with matcha syrup and condensed milk. Think fluffy shaved ice with layers of bright, borderline-bitter matcha syrup balanced out by a sweet, thick drizzle of condensed milk. Yeah, more coffee shops should have kakig\u014dri. And probably vintage stores too.Explore Bon App\u00e9titJapanTravelRestaurantsRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
