However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Our collective love for the mandoline is no secret. Senior food editor Andy Baraghani even wrote about how the tool totally changed his life when he first encountered it in a restaurant kitchen many years ago. The deep pleasure of witnessing a cucumber become uniform rounds, or zucchini elegant ribbons, or fennel paper-thin wisps never gets old. That is, until the moment you cut yourself. Luckily, there\u2019s a way to prevent that disillusionment (and injured digit) from happening: protective cut-resistant gloves.(Jump to 9:39 to watch Natalie Portman and Carla Lalli Music sport the gloves.)\n\u201cThis glove is amazing and gives me confidence when I\u2019m using a mandoline,\u201d senior food editor Anna Stockwell says as she pulls out a single heather grey glove from her station. The hand guards that come with certain mandolines can be clunky and difficult to work with, she explains, but the NoCry Cut Resistant Gloves she uses are flexible and comfortable.Made of food safe ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (i.e. an extremely strong material that is used in suspension lines for skydiving, climbing gear, etc.), glass fiber, and Spandex, these gloves have been designed to resist cuts from the sharpest blades. But their thin fibers and tight weave makes them more like fine chain mail than a clunky suit of armor. Better yet, they\u2019re totally ambidextrous, and you only need to wear one at a time.I mean, we could probably find some other reasons to wear these...\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigThey\u2019re so useful, in fact, we\u2019ll use them when chopping, grating, peeling\u2014shucking oysters even. Heck, they\u2019re so versatile (and kinda cool looking?), I might just throw them on anytime I walk into a kitchen.NoCry Cut Resistant Gloves$11 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titToolsShoppingRecipes you want to make.
