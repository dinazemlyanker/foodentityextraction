She also knows her way around a kitchen\u2014and, like so many of us, occasionally swipes at frosting instead of waiting for the whole cake. Here she reveals who she\u2019d invite to her dream dinner party and what she\u2019d serve them\u2014including, of course, banana pudding cake from her brand-new and already sold out collaboration with Duncan Hines.If you could have any three guests\u2014real or fictional, deceased or alive\u2014to your dream dinner party, who would they be?I\u2019d have Jesus at the head of the table. And I\u2019d also invite Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and Elvis.That\u2019s some gathering! What do you make for this group of mostly Southerners?For Elvis I\u2019d make a peanut butter and banana sandwich. I\u2019d make something good and Southern for me and Dr. King. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d love some collards, as would I. Of course, we\u2019d have to have some barbecue ribs. There\u2019s nothing I love better, especially when it comes with a good sauce, which makes all the difference. I like my sauce between sweet and vinegary. And I like my barbecue to be real tender so I don't have to gnaw on that bone. Now, Jesus, that\u2019s another story. He may not want to eat. But just in case, I\u2019d make sure we had some milk and honey. The others could drink sweet tea. Before we dove in I\u2019d ask Jesus to bless the whole thing.For dessert I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ll serve one of your new cakes from your collaboration? Is cake your favorite dessert?Banana pudding is my favorite dessert\u2014real banana pudding in a big bowl. That\u2019s what inspired me to do a banana pudding cake collaboration with Duncan Hines. It\u2019s very good; I think you\u2019ll agree. I\u2019d also serve the other cake in the line, our coconut cake. People in the South like to bake a coconut cake for special occasions because it looks impressive and is delicious. I\u2019d use our buttercream frosting too. I\u2019d serve it with coffee or milk. I love cake and milk.Speaking of your new cake line, have you ever made a cake from a box mix and passed it off as your own?We\u2019ve all done that. The other thing I\u2019ve done is eat more icing than cake. I\u2019m like a kid. If there is something sweet, I\u2019m going to eat it.What\u2019s the ambience and topic of conversation?It\u2019s casual. I\u2019d want them to feel welcome in my home and wear what they\u2019re comfortable in. I\u2019d do the same. We\u2019d talk about the gifts we have. What we have done so far to help people and what we can continue to try to do. I\u2019d be asking Jesus a lot of questions. I\u2019d be talking music with Elvis. And I\u2019d thank Martin Luther King Jr. for all that he did and continues to do even though he\u2019s gone. We\u2019d have lots of good stuff to talk about.If, after the dinner, Elvis wants to go to Dollywood, where in the amusement park should he eat?We\u2019ve got great restaurants all over the park. Restaurants that serve real Southern foods: barbecue, corn on the cob, and all of that. But we have a resort called DreamMore and there is a restaurant attached to it, Song & Hearth. People just love the food. He might like that or he might like Aunt Granny\u2019s.Explore Bon App\u00e9titDream Dinner PartyPop CultureInterviewsRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
