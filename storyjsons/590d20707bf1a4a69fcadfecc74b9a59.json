Lamb chops have plenty of fat, which can make them prone to flare-ups on the grill. Turn them often and move them around so they brown without taking on an acrid charred flavor.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

This recipe brought it all back.  It's perfect in every way.  I also tried it using pork shoulder, which I cut into chops and served sliced in small pieces with sticky rice and basil, cilantro, mint, and a sprinkle of Nuoc Cham, all wrapped up in butter lettuce.
