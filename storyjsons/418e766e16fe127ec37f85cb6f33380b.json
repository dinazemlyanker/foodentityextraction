Make sure your tomatoes and watermelon are room temperature: If they\u2019re too cold, they\u2019ll make the spiced coconut oil seize.Ingredients4\u20136 servings \u00bccup virgin coconut oil1tsp. coarsely crushed peppercorns1tsp. coarsely crushed coriander seeds\u00bdtsp. cumin seeds\u00bdtsp. ground turmeric\u00bclarge seedless watermelon (about 3 lb.), preferably yellow, rind removed, flesh cut into \u00bd\" pieces (about 4 cups)2medium heirloom tomatoes, cut into \u00bd\" pieces8oz. mild French feta, cut into \u00bd\" piecesFlaky sea saltPreparationStep 1Heat coconut oil, peppercorns, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, and turmeric in a small saucepan over medium until fragrant, about 3 minutes.

I used olive oil because I had it on hand and subbed fresh peaches for the watermelon - that spiced oil really tied the sweet and savory together!  Loved it!!Chris F453449/2/2021This salad is delicious with an impressive array of complex flavours and textures for something that's also very refreshing and summery. The turmeric oil holds its own as an ingredient, I sprinkle it on soups and toast - it's very versatile.kiaradeanLondon, UK3/27/2021Super juicy and great mix of flavors. bulldogdadSeattle8/2/2020Delicious. Definitely serve immediately after making, as it over tenderizes and falls apart quick. Flavor is great though and perfect for a quick summer salad that is both fruity and sweet with just the right amount of savory and spice. AnonymousSeattle8/2/2020Outstanding combination of flavors, especially now with fruit in peak season.  Note:  It is absolutely essential that fruit is not cold, but room temperature, when mixing in oil - if it seizes, it's not pretty.  Also,  I agree with other reviewer - if taking it to a BBQ - assemble right before serving.  Definitely a keeper.aclouserNJ9/1/2019I liked this salad a lot. The flavors of watermelon and tomatoes with the spices and feta are superb. I wasn't a fan of the coconut taste coming from the oil though. It combined rather oddly with the tomatoes and spices. The next time I make this I think I'll swap in either a savory tasting oil like olive oil, or a more neutral tasting oil like grapeseed. It's also important to note that this is a very very juicy salad, and it only gets juicier as it sits. I wouldn't take this to a potluck, and if serving it at dinner I would assemble the salad right before serving. AbbyRAlabama7/5/2019I loved this recipe but the next time I'll make it with avocado oil as it can only be served right away with coconut oil and not stored in the fridge for leftovers as the coconut oil will harden. staceyfedericoLondon6/18/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladWatermelonMelonFruitTomatoVegetableFetaCheeseSummerQuickSideGluten-FreeVegetarianHealthyishLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
