Too many parties\u2014yes, that\u2019s a thing! Too much rich food. Too many cocktails. Now we\u2019re making promises to ourselves. Raise your hand if you\u2019ve made any of the following pledges:I\u2019m going to eat healthier and maybe even pursue a dry January (Christina Chaey\u2019s plan to cook, eat, and drink \u201cHealthyish\u201d in 2022 to the rescue). I\u2019m going to cook more meals at home so I can save for that vacation I\u2019ve been craving (enter quick and flavorful weeknight recipes developed by our test kitchen, like Creamy Spinach and Chickpeas and this Sheet-Pan Chicken and Squash Salad). I\u2019m finally going to renovate my kitchen (with the help of designer Elizabeth Roberts\u2019s kitchen layout advice).\u00a0For these New Year\u2019s resolutions and others, Bon App\u00e9tit has you covered. Plus, we\u2019ve got a rice story by Jessica B. Harris, whose book, High on the Hog, was the basis for the popular Netflix documentary series. And as we make our way through the gloom of February, test kitchen director Chris Morocco adds a little color to our lives with a bright and seasonal series of winter salads. We love these bright and crunchy dishes because they\u2019re hearty and delicious\u2014not because we\u2019re on a diet. As you\u2019ll note, that wasn\u2019t on the pledge list, and after reading senior staff writer Alex Beggs\u2019s deep dive on what she calls \u201cThe Diet Delusion,\u201d you\u2019ll know why.\u00a0So here\u2019s to ditching that diet and eating in ways that make us feel good in 2022.Explore Bon App\u00e9titLetter From The EditorRecipes you want to make.
