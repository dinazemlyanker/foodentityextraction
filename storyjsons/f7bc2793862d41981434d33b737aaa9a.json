At first it was for financial reasons\u2014I was 22 and making an hourly salary equivalent to the cost of a Chipotle burrito (no guac)\u2014but then the habit stuck. Over the years, I\u2019ve learned to find joy in the simple act of it, which helps keep me from ever feeling like I\u2019m \u201cmeal prepping,\u201d a term I find totally depressing. Plus, the longer I do it, the more efficient in the kitchen I become and the more motivated I feel to keep going.I\u2019ve also found creative freedom in ditching the notion that lunch has to look like something you\u2019d find on the menu at an all-day caf\u00e9. A pile of lentils over quickly torn greens with crumbled feta and lemony dressing or a mishmash of leftover roasted veg with a scoop of hummus and some cooked grains might not be lookers, but they\u2019re the kind of nourishing fuel I need to power through most afternoons. And, they beat the $13+ I\u2019d have to shell out for a mediocre salad bowl any day.Here are a few strategies I\u2019ve incorporated into my life to make bringing my lunch to work a little more enjoyable, varied, healthy, and, above all, not a big deal.This all-day-every-day yogurt sauce makes literally everything better.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiCook Something Every DayOkay, half of you have stopped reading. But hear me out: Even if you spend only a few minutes passing through your kitchen every day, I guarantee you can sneak in a tiny bit of cooking that will pay dividends you can eat in the form of more-exciting future lunches. I\u2019ve recently gotten into the (admittedly kind of extra) habit of cooking in the mornings before work. (I consider this one microscopic step forward in my lifelong mission to emulate The Cut editor-in-chief Stella Bugbee, who is also an aficionado of a.m. cookery.) I\u2019ll put on the kettle for coffee, then tackle a small cooking task in the six or so minutes it takes the water to come to a boil. I\u2019ll quickly saut\u00e9 a handful of kale with sliced garlic and sesame oil to add to that day\u2019s lunch. Or I\u2019ll sear a couple of chicken sausages that I know I\u2019ll throw into a pasta or tacos in the next few days. Maybe grate a garlic clove into yogurt for an all-purpose sauce for the week. These mini-prep moments don\u2019t necessarily have to happen in the morning, of course. The key is to stealthily fold these tasks into the parts of your existing routine that bring you into the kitchen in the first place (in my case, making my morning coffee) so it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re going out of your way.Get the Recipe:Quick-Cooked KaleAll Day Every Day SauceWho\u2019s not getting excited about these for lunch?\nMake One Thing You\u2019re Truly Stoked to EatIf I\u2019m not deeply excited about what I\u2019ve packed for lunch, I will actively look for any excuse not to eat it (and buy something else instead). No matter how noble my broccoli-and-lentil-filled intentions, I\u2019ve learned that I need to include a \u201ctreat\u201d in the mix to psych myself up for lunch as a whole. For me, this treat usually falls under my all-time favorite food group: simple ass carbs. Tucking some roasted potatoes, a couple of fritters, or some noodles into my lunch is usually sufficient to quell my starchy desires, which means I will happily eat piles of vegetables/whole grains/seeds/good stuff alongside. Again, it\u2019s all about the mental trickery.Get the Recipes:Corn-Jalape\u00f1o FrittersPerfectly Roasted PotatoesUdon with Chicken and Garlicky Peanut DressingShop SmarterYou\u2019ve heard this before, likely from my colleague, food director Carla Lalli Music, who basically wrote an entire cookbook about embracing frequent, small grocery trips. It\u2019s a smart strategy not just for making lunch, but for any and all cooking endeavors: Buy only what you need and you\u2019re almost guaranteed to waste less food. I am extremely fortunate to live in a major metropolitan area where the Trader Joe\u2019s is a skip away from the nose-to-tail butcher shop, so I can generally build in a highly directed, 10-minute trip to the store (no dawdling in the cheese aisle!) on my way home from work most nights. But you can still use the \u201cshop smarter\u201d mentality even if you\u2019re mostly a once-a-week shopper. Prioritize buying ingredients that are easily adaptable (lemons, garlic, good-quality tinned fish) and consider whether you need to buy the whole bag of lemons, or whether you can get by perfectly fine with just a couple.Never mad seeing a container of these in the fridge.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Sue Li, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiBig-Batch in a Smart WayI\u2019m not opposed to the idea of all big-batch cooking\u2014just the kind that leaves you with five identical plastic storage containers filled with equal portions of practical slop. On Sundays, I try to make no more than two or three batches of \u201cbuilding block\u201d foods to mix and match throughout the week as my whims change. Things like a small pot of lemony chickpeas, a batch of grains like farro, and a panful of crispy mushrooms. I store everything in separate clear glass containers so I know exactly what (and how much) I have at all times. Because everything is already cooked, I\u2019m only ever a few minutes away from putting together a decently cohesive meal. For example, I might stir-fry some cooked farro in sesame oil with scallions, add a handful of chopped jarred kimchi and a splash of soy sauce, and throw in some mushrooms, and boom: kimchi-mushroom fried grains, a lunch I would happily eat every day.Get the Recipes:Quite Possibly the Best ChickpeasSeared Mushrooms with Garlic and ThymeKimchi Fried GrainsQuick-cooked kale. So easy. So tasty.\nMinimize the Boring StuffI cook for a living, but this does not make me exempt from passionately hating the following prep tasks:Anything related to the peeling, mincing, or Microplaning of ginger, that cursed rhizomeWiping dirt chunks off mushroomsPeeling garlicWashing, spinning, tearing up, and storing greens, especially delicate salad greens that will start making brown juice in the fridge if you store them before they\u2019re bone dryThese activities all become infinitely more unappealing when I\u2019m faced with the prospect of having to do them every single time I want to cook something. So...I don\u2019t. On days when I know I\u2019ll have a few hours to dedicate to cooking, usually Sundays, I\u2019ll suck it up and tear up the whole bunch of kale, pick some herbs and stash them in a bag, or mince a bunch of ginger for adding to stir-fries and dressings. (Just make sure they\u2019re air tight!) Commit to these pesky tasks in one fell swoop upfront, and you\u2019ll be rewarded......at least until next week when you\u2019ll do it all over again. Life is not an episode of 30 Minute Meals, and that bunch of gritty spinach will never come with a small army of house-elves who will wash it for you in the middle of the night. Like any cooking endeavor, committing to lunch takes some thoughtful planning and a bit of work. But there\u2019s no deeper state of relaxation for me than going to bed on Sunday knowing there\u2019s a fridge full of building blocks and a sauce or two waiting to become something healthful and delicious. And there\u2019s nothing better than waking up than a lunch I know I can look forward to.Explore Bon App\u00e9titLunchRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
