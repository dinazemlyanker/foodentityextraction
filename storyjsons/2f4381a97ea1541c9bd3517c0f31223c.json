One minute you'd be kneading a dough ball the size of your donkey by hand, and the next you\u2019d be like, \u201cOh shoot, I forgot to collect the firewood!\u201d There were no ovens, no pre-wrapped golden bricks of unsalted butter, and, most devastating, no KitchenAid mixers. Thankfully, those colorful countertop icons have become the workhorses (work-donkeys?) of our modern kitchens. With just the flick of a knob we can prep toasty morning buns, caramelized apple galettes, and dramatic meringue puddings in minutes.Since the industrial stand mixer\u2019s invention in the 1910s, what the behemoth original has lost in size (about 75 quarts), it\u2019s gained in versatility. The KitchenAid mixer we know and love comes with a flat edge beater to mix brownies or cream butter and sugar; a whisk, for whipping egg whites, frosting, and fresh cream; and a dough hook, which makes light work of kneading focaccia, pizza dough, and other yeast-based breads. And with the fleet of other nifty attachments\u2014 a slicer for shredding carrots, a food grinder for making sausages, and a flex edge beater that scrapes the bowl for you\u2014the possibilities are truly endless.So are the Cyber Monday deals. Across the internet, the KitchenAid mixer is on sale at discounts of up to 25% off, making now\u2014as in, right now!\u2014the best time to buy one. Or, if you\u2019re already on team stand mixer, cop a bunch of new attachments at a prices you probably won\u2019t see again, at least until this time next year. (And if you\u2019re looking for other great steals on kitchen appliances, look no further than our ultimate list of Cyber Monday kitchen deals.)
