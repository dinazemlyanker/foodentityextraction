I am allergic to nuts and sesame; Ben is vegan. My fridge almost always contained four different cheeses; his cabinets were stocked with trail mix and tahini. The overlap in the Venn diagram of our diets was razor-thin\u2014and yet, we began a friendship by cooking together.On a Tuesday night in October, Ben invited me over to cook for the first time. I had moved to Birmingham, Alabama five months prior for a writing job at a lifestyle magazine and had yet to make any real friends (aside from my roommate). Ben and I had met on a camping trip, when I\u2019d spontaneously joined a group of friendly strangers for a weekend of hiking up waterfalls and floating down rivers. Over a jar of pickled okra, Ben and I discovered our shared passion for cooking, and I discovered my soft spot for a blue-eyed boy who wore goggles to swim.Related: The Things We Eat for OthersContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.That night at his place, we made falafel and green beans and tomato confit. As he pressed his thumb into a cherry tomato, I asked how he\u2019d become vegan. He said it started as a bet. \u201cMe and my friend were gonna see if we could do it for a month, and it wasn\u2019t that bad,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cBut I make some exceptions.\u201dHe pulled up a manifesto on his laptop\u2013three pages he\u2019d written outlining occasions when it was acceptable to break from veganism.There was the When in Rome clause\u2014\u201cWhen I\u2019m somewhere that\u2019s known for a certain food, I\u2019m going to eat it\u201d\u2014and the Home Cooking clause\u2014\u201cIf you\u2019re a guest in someone\u2019s home, it would be rude to turn down food someone has prepared for you\u201d\u2014and a slew of others, all focused on making veganism more accessible. I looked at him in his half-unbuttoned Hawaiian shirt and the whole thing felt unbelievable; not untruthful, but extraordinary. He felt extraordinary.Cooking with Ben felt like wandering aimlessly through a new city. We spent hours over the stove, riffing off each other\u2019s ideas. Sometimes he would surprise me with a wild card\u2014a block of silken tofu, a bushel of carrot tops\u2014and ask how we could incorporate it into the meal. \u201cSilken tofu aioli,\u201d I\u2019d say. \u201cCarrot top chimichurri!\u201d he would smile.From the beginning, Ben\u2019s attention felt like a gift. He lived in a cool loft downtown, and I lived in a dingy apartment in the suburbs. He spent his weekends visiting friends in New Orleans and Philadelphia, while I spent mine sitting alone at breweries, reading to pass the time. More than anything tangible, I envied Ben\u2019s self-confidence\u2014he knew exactly who he was and did not think to apologize for it.At 23 years old, I thought I knew who I was too. I loved Victorian novels and my tie-dye Crocs (which I wore well before they were cool). I didn\u2019t know how to ride a bike and sometimes cried when I was hungry. The difference between Ben and me, though, was that I did not truly believe that I could be loved for all of these qualities. After countless failed, not-quite-relationships, I\u2019d never found true romantic connection by being entirely myself. Maybe to be loved, I figured, was to make oneself lovable.My veganism started with small changes. I switched from 2% cow\u2019s milk to oat milk and stocked my pantry with chickpeas. But then I stopped buying meat altogether, loading up on tofu. I sent Ben photos whenever I was eating something vegan. Looking back at our texts, I cringe at the eagerness with which I wrote: \u201cFirst time w tempeh!!\u201d and \u201cMatzah and !!! Vegan butter !!!\u201d Sometimes, he responded with a small affirmation\u2014\u201cNice!\u201d\u2014or a thumbs up emoji. Sometimes he didn\u2019t respond at all.Before I met Ben, I\u2019d never genuinely considered cutting out meat or dairy. I love burgers and Parmesan and baking with full-fat butter. But somehow there I was, making \u201cricotta\u201d out of tofu and coating my popcorn in nutritional yeast just so I could tell someone about it. Meanwhile, Ben constantly forgot about my food allergies, nearly feeding me nuts or sesame on multiple occasions.Let me be honest here: I was also remarkably bad at being vegan. Unsatisfied by meals of lettuce and chickpeas, I found constant excuses to break from my vegan diet. One month into my veganism, I posted a photo of a bloody double-cut rib eye on Instagram, captioned: \u201cFck labels. I\u2019m still half vegan. No regrets.\u201dBut I did, in fact, have regrets. All of my digressions came charged with guilt\u2014every time I ate a slice of steak or a spoonful of ice cream, I felt like I\u2019d failed. I tried to make light of what I saw were my shortcomings by performing a carefree, relaxed approach to plant-based eating, but in reality I was deeply ashamed.Then, a few months into the pandemic, I lost my magazine job. Out of options, I applied to be a baker at Birmingham\u2019s local creamery. I loved baking for a living, but I faced one piece of dissonance: It was officially part of my job to eat dairy. I spent my days watching hundreds of quarts of liquid silk churn out of the ice cream machine: goat cheese ice cream swirled with magenta-hued strawberry-hibiscus jam, or sweet cream loaded with chunks of cookie dough and ribbons of malted fudge. Sometimes, my coworkers and I shouted \u201cQuality control!\u201d as an excuse to dip our spoons into the soft ripples of freshly spun dessert.After a few months of ice cream taste tests, my veganism felt more and more like a charade. Ben didn\u2019t even seem to care about what I internalized as my failures. When I\u2019d posted that photo of a steak, he commented: \u201cHalf vegan is better than none at all.\u201d I no longer wanted to be vegan, but letting go of a plant-based lifestyle felt like admitting defeat. My inability to stick to a vegan diet only reinforced the anxiety that had spurred my whole plant-based journey in the first place: that I was not enough.But this past January, things changed. Ben started dating someone else. He broke the news while the two of us sat huddled under blankets on my back porch. He\u2019d just returned from a road trip with a close friend\u2014now his girlfriend. I must be honest here too: Ben and I had never become more than friends, no matter how many times I professed my feelings (twice). Still, I\u2019d held out hope. Maybe, one day, he will see it, I\u2019d thought. Maybe, one day, he will see me. But as I looked at him in that moment, blond hair curling in tufts out the bottom of his beanie, I knew that my fantasy of what he and I could be had to end.Only then did I start to understand the ways I\u2019d changed myself to appeal to him. He never asked me to try out veganism: I volunteered for it. I desperately wanted to fit into his life, to be the kind of person he could see himself with\u2014quietly becoming a smaller and smaller version of myself along the way. Ben and I could only be real friends, I realized, once I was my real self.I am no longer vegan. I eat ice cream almost every day, and I don\u2019t feel bad about it anymore. Ben and I are still close friends who cook together often. A few weeks ago, we made mushroom tacos with couscous and adobo sauce. After dinner, we settled on the couch and I pulled a quart container of leftover chiffon cake out of my bag.\u201cI made this cake today,\u201d I said, holding a misshapen piece out to him. \u201cThe scraps would\u2019ve been thrown away.\u201d I waited for him to catch on, watching as he mentally flipped through his manifesto. Then, he smiled.\u201cFood Waste Clause,\u201d he said. We ate the cake together, licking the crumbs off our fingers.Explore Bon App\u00e9titVeganessayRecipes you want to make.
