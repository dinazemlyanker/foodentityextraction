As noted by other reviewers, the proportions for the puree are all wrong and because of that, the color of the dish is so unappealing.  Readers should not need to read comments for such drastic modifications. This recipe is way too much work for such a disappointing outcome--looks NOTHING like the photo.  Deb SWashington DC3/5/2022This recipe is very flavourful all around! I will definitely be making this on the regular.\nThe pur\u00e9e was indeed how others described in the comments- grey in colour and thin (I used baby bella mushrooms). The simmering times were spot on, but next time i may cut back on the broth by half a cup and/or add more mushrooms. It was so delicious nevertheless!\nI skipped the stovetop brown and went straight for the oven with the chicken breasts; they got a bit dried out so next time i\u2019ll do my normal 450 bake. The jus helped rehydrate the chicken- big thumbs up on taste.\nAnd the chard\u2026I\u2019ve never had chard in my life, let alone cooked it. It was really good! I let it get a bit crispy and it complimented very well.\nI served it over Liviva rice shaped shirataki and it completed the meal for me. Definitely recommend this! Jo SteinbargerSaint Paul, MN12/23/2021This is absolutely fabulous!! The mushroom pur\u00e9e is heavenly and could be put on anything! I used homemade chicken stock and used less stock than the recipe calls for based on comments. 10 out of 10 and I\u2019ve made it several times.AnonymousSaint Louis 12/14/2021I loved the mushroom puree, but as others have mentioned the color is offputting and not as pictured. My husband wouldn\u2019t touch it because of the color. Unfortunately this won\u2019t be a new recipe in the rotation!KatieNC12/13/2021This recipe was delicious, I left out the creme fraiche and used Silk heavy cream for my lactose intolerant wife. I used button mushrooms but my puree was definitely a grey color and not the beautiful golden brown color pictured above. the taste was delicious though. My chicken was juicy with perfectly crisp skin. I will definitely be making this recipe again. Barbara Houston, TX12/6/2021The mushroom pur\u00e9e was absolutely delicious, but the color (even after a much longer reduction time than called for) was much lighter. Next time I would use cremini mushrooms. The dish seemed to be lacking acid, so I separated the stems and leaves on the chard and cooked the stems in an agrodolce and topped the dish with them. I think this could still use additional acid, so next time I will remove the chicken skin, fry, and toss with vinegar powder and salt. DevinDenver, CO10/31/2021I made this tonight- it did take some time to reduce. I looked at all the comments first- but decided to follow the recipe except I had 16 oz of mushrooms to add. The mushroom puree was heaven and the perfect consistency. The chicken breasts were juicy and flavorful. The swiss chard freshly picked from my garden was earthy and soft- paired really with the puree. I will definitely make this again.Karen OSalt Lake City10/17/2021This was AMAZING!  I literally wanted to lick my plate.  After reading some of the reviews I was a bit skeptical, but figured I'd test it myself.  I think the key is just to give yourself more time to reduce everything completely and trust that you know the texture/consistency that you are going for.  It's puree not soup.  If it looks like it's not reduced enough...keep going.  It probably took twice as long to reduce everything properly if not longer.  I did have a few more mushrooms than 8 oz so just went that and I didn't have cr\u00e8me fraiche (didn't miss it!).  Don't leave our the truffle oil.  Served with an Oregon Pinot... I think I'm having it again tonight. AnonymousPortland, OR10/17/2021This was one of the best things I\u2019ve ever made!! Truly! I followed directions exactly and used homemade chicken broth and kale. Highly recommend. I had no issues with pur\u00e9e being too runny. I think you just have to really reduce it down. It made lots of pur\u00e9e and I cooked a third chicken breast. Fabulous! AnonymousMissouri10/11/2021Incredible flavors.  Way too much liquid to reduce.  Agree with halving the liquid (both broth and cream) in the mushrooms.  Great dish though! Will make again with modifications\nAimeeMinneapolis 10/4/2021The puree is more like a soup or thin gravy than a puree.  Double the mushrooms and use half the chicken broth.  And next time, I will use boneless breasts, since they are tough to cut coming out of the oven.Mountain GirlDenver CO9/29/2021The pur\u00e9e is way too soupy.
