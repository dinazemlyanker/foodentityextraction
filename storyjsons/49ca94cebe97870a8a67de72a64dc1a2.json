I\u2019m not one of those people. My Saturday self care routine involves a one-mile stroll from my apartment in Brooklyn to Lella Alimentari.Lella is a hybrid of a third-wave coffee shop and a teensy grocery store plucked off of a vicolo, or small alley, in Italy. The shelves are stocked with imported goods\u2014cans of tomatoes, beautifully packaged olive oil, bags of dried pasta\u2014while the walls look like something a nonna decorated, down to the children\u2019s dolls. My friends refer to Lella as \u201cciao,\u201d which is how the Tuscan baristas greet you as you breeze through the doors.Lella is never not packed, but somehow my friends and I always hold court at the long white-washed table that runs down the middle of the cafe. It\u2019s our version of the Central Perk couch. More often than not we\u2019ll be nursing hangovers with a large iced coffee and a piadine, an Italian flatbread sandwich that\u2019s stuffed with prosciutto cotto, speck, stracchino cheese, arugula, and radicchio. The bitter greens paired with the warm, melty cheese, and the salty cured meat makes me feel like I\u2019m eating a balanced meal\u2014it\u2019s texturally balanced so that counts. Plus, everyone knows the best hangover cure is carbs, cheese, and meat. Sometimes we\u2019ll moonlight as people who have it together, coming in earlier before the crowds roll in and catching up over breakfast salads of egg, shishito pepper, and avocado. All the shades of green remind me of what\u2019s in an actually balanced meal.No matter the breakfast order, a visit to \u201cciao\u201d is the perfect way to start my Saturday, no boxing gloves or smelly gym locker rooms needed.Go there: Lella AlimentariExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendCoffeeBrooklynRead MorerestaurantsThe Backyard at Saturdays Is My One Way Ticket Out of NYC\u2019s Gnarly Summer HeatBy Alex DelanyRecipes you want to make.
