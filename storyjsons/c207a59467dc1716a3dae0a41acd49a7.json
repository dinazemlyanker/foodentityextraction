And while it may not scream out to you from among the stracciatella or amarena, once you\u2019ve tasted gelato al fior di latte, you\u2019re in on the secret.For drizzling onto gelato, ice cream, or an empty spoon:Taken on its own, the phrase \u201cfior di latte\u201d translates to \u201cflower of milk\u201d and refers to cow\u2019s milk mozzarella. But when applied to the world of dessert (which, in my book, reigns a smidge supreme over the world of cheese), the phrase points to gelato that\u2019s typically made from only dairy, sugar, and starch (incorporate yolks and you\u2019ve got the richer, eggier \u201ccrema\u201d).With an ingredient list so pared-down, the quality of the milk and cream is critical. During my time working as a pastry cook at an Italian restaurant in New York City, the gelato al fior di latte got special attention: We saved the local milk for the \u201cFDL\u201d and the FDL only.At San Francisco\u2019s Che Fico, a giant ball of FDL balances atop a blackberry crostata.\nAngela PinkertonThe servers would describe FDL to unfamiliar diners as \u201can Italian vanilla,\u201d which I\u2019m pretty sure sent shudders down the spine of the executive pastry chef. Because it\u2019s actually the absence of the oft-overpowering vanilla bean (or the cloyingness of imitation vanilla) that makes FDL so special. At a recent meal with friends at I Sodi, a West Village restaurant deemed \u201ckinda perfect\u201d by Adam Rapoport, the FDL that came alongside grilled apricots floored everyone at the table. We figured there must be something more than milk, cream, and sugar: Maybe the milk was infused with apricot pits, or maybe the base was sweetened with wildflower honey? But no: It was simply the taste of dairy, free from the pervasive vanilla bean (or, in the words of cookbook writer Emiko Davies, the simple, innocent flavor of good milk, \u201cbare-faced\u201d).In Italy, gelato al fior di latte\u2014not vanilla\u2014is a display case staple, holding court alongside pistachio, hazelnut, and chocolate at every shop. Because it is so simple, it often serves as a barometer for the quality of the gelateria. Tasting Rome author Katie Parla told me that FDL might be overlooked by visitors who assume it ordinary, but it\u2019s \u201clike a margherita pizza: it\u2019s the benchmark for quality and if it\u2019s good, then you can trust the other menu items.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cpure and there are no strong flavors to hide behind,\u201d Jon Snyder, owner of NYC\u2019s Il Laboratorio del Gelato, explained. Gelato al fior di latte is \u201csimply \u2018milk\u2019\u2014basically unflavored\u2014and therefore you can really taste the quality of the milk, the sweetness (whether under or over), and the texture.\u201d According to Snyder, it should not be airy or overly sweet.And since every shop in Italy must display ingredients, Parla said, \u201cyou don\u2019t even have to taste a gelato to know if it\u2019s going to be mediocre.\u201d If you see powders, oils, emulsifiers, or other hard-to-translate words, be suspicious.If you don\u2019t seek out FDL at a restaurant like New York\u2019s Maialino or San Francisco\u2019s Che Fico, you might not run into it in the U.S., where vanilla remains king (Parla had never encountered the flavor before moving to Italy 15 years ago). But with the price of vanilla beans going up, might there be room for another white-bread gelato in the ice cream case? For those of us who dream of \u201ca smooth, cold glass of milk on a hot day\u2026 but better\u201d (Morgan Morano\u2019s description in The Art of Making Gelato), we can certainly hope.Get the recipe for a Nutella sundae starring FDL:Italian Sundaes with NutellaThis riff on an American sundae swaps out the hot fudge and whipped cream for nutella and mascarpone cheese.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titGelatoIce CreamItalySummer DessertsSummerFrozen DessertRead MorecookingOur 11 Favorite Artisanal Ice Cream Brands and FlavorsBy Julia KramerRecipes you want to make.
