Well good on you if you actually do that, but I tend to... not.Which is how I found myself deciding to make this Hanger Steak with Charred Scallion Sauce the day after a four-day eating bender in London. And eating it for dinner... and lunch the next day... and then dinner again. I didn\u2019t even warm it up for dinner number two. I just ate cold steak and cold rice. So uh, I\u2019ve pretty much eaten only steak for the past two days. Cool. Maybe I should be a life coach.Onward!Here\u2019s a thing I don\u2019t like about toasting nuts: In most recipes, you always have to wait for them to cool before moving onto the next step. I don\u2019t have that kind of patience. But in this recipe, you grate garlic and add olive oil while the nuts are still warm. This is how I knew we were meant to be. Me and this steak.From there, you cook the hanger steak in a cast iron pan, let it rest, and add scallions to the pan. Hot tip: You need two bunches of scallions. But, if you only buy one bunch because you\u2019ve literally never had a recipe call for two bunches, for example, it\u2019s all going to be fine. Let the scallions char and shrink a bit, then slice \u2018em into one-inch pieces.Like so.\nAdd them to the nut mixture, plus 5 tablespoons red wine vinegar (this recipe is great for vinegar-fiends), 1 tablespoon chopped cornichons (okay let\u2019s be real, you\u2019ve already eaten six cornichons while the steak was cooking, so chop whatever you have), 1 tablespoon chopped capers, 1 tablespoon mustard, and a pinch of sugar.This sauce is everything. You\u2019ll keep eating more steak not even because steak is always delicious but because the super acidic sauce mixed with the steak is apparently an effective antidote to jet lag, that itchy cut on your arm, your mounting credit card bill from said London weekend, and that one reply-all thread that just. won\u2019t. die.So eat the steak. Spoon the sauce straight from the bowl if you need to. Everything is gonna be fine.
