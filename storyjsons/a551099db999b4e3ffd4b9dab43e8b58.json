So why should you hit up a new-school bakery right now? Keep reading.The matcha-lemon croissant and the Ferrero Rocher croissant from Supermoon in NYC.\nPhoto by Alex LauWe\u2019ve Totally Taken the Insta BaitIf you \u2019gram it, they will come. At least that seems to be the philosophy behind the surge in ultraphotogenic sweets you\u2019re seeing, from jet-black doughnuts to Technicolor croissants. Just because a rainbow bagel photographs well doesn\u2019t mean we want to eat it, but when the sweets taste as good as they look (Exhibit A: The matcha-lemon croissant from NYC\u2019s Supermoon Bakehouse, above), we don\u2019t mind being superficial.The counter at Austin's Le Politique, and their cinnamon rolls, chocolate tarts, and clafoutis.\nPhoto by Wynn MyersArchitectural Digest Would ApproveWhen designing the patisserie arm of Austin\u2019s hipster-Gallic Le Politique, designer Melanie Raines wanted to evoke spaces like L.A.\u2019s Bottega Louie and Paris\u2019 Ladur\u00e9e, filtered through a casual downtown lens. This means white Carrara marble counters, powder-blue tiled floors, and the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance: hand-screen-printed wallpaper from Portland, Oregon, design studio Makelike. (Which you can buy!) \u201cThis isn\u2019t a very fancy patisserie where you don\u2019t want to bring your children,\u201d Raines says. \u201cThe vibrant wallpaper really plays to that.\u201dGet your very own cookie subscription from BK17 Bakery.\nPhoto by Alex LauSometimes They\u2019re Not Brick-and-Mortar Bakeries at AllLevee Baking Co., New OrleansWilla Jean alum Christina Balzebre specializes in laminated pastries (like morning buns scented with Meyer lemon) and decadent vegan cookies (ahem, salty-chocolate-olive-oil) at her pop-up out of a shared space with Cajun restaurant Mosquito Supper Club.Third Culture Bakery, Berkeley, CAThe Bay Area\u2019s baked good of the moment\u2014the mochi muffin, a puffy, precious specimen containing rice flour, coconut, and pandan leaf\u2014comes courtesy of this new wholesale venture, which sells to coffee shops throughout the area.BK17 Bakery, BrooklynGood news! You don\u2019t even have to leave the house to try Sarah Owens\u2019 dark chocolate-bee pollen lace cookies and cocoa-tahini bites. Her mail-order subscription service ships cookies straight to your door.The Pastry ArchetypesFor all the creativity happening at bakeries right now, there are a few pastry archetypes we\u2019ve spotted (and eaten!) over and over again. Not that we\u2019re complaining\u2014the world could certainly use more morning buns.Who says everything spice can only top a bagel? Not Chicago\u2019s Fat Rice.\nPhoto by Matt HaasThe Savory PastryBeets star in galettes at North Bakery in Providence, sea buckthorn sneaks into the muffins at Kantine in SF, and everything spice tops these doughy knots from The Bakery at Fat Rice in Chicago.We\u2019ll take six of the crullers from NYC donut shop Du\u2019s, please.\nPhoto by Alex LauThe CrullerCruller fever has taken hold in New York in particular, from the crazy popular glazed offerings at Daily Provisions to this corn powder\u2013dusted, kaffir lime\u2013infused specimen from Du\u2019s Donuts.There\u2019s cardamom in this morning bun from Machine Shop in Philly.\nPhoto by Stevie ChrisThe Morning BunIf you\u2019ve had a great morning bun in Philadelphia, it\u2019s probably been this cardamom-pecan beauty, made by Machine Shop Boulangerie and sold at the city\u2019s coolest coffee shops.Bellecour in Minnesota knows that bigger is better.\nCourtesy of BellecourThe Giant CookieThe current cookie mantra: Bigger is better. Consider the huge strawberry lemonade cookie at Ma\u00f1ana in Austin or this oversize flourless chocolate one from Bellecour in Wayzata, MN.At Seylou, one of the alt grains is Danko Rye, a variety of Hard Red Winter Wheat grown by Heinz Thomet at Next Step Produce in Newburg, Maryland.\nPhoto by Scott SuchmanThey\u2019re Ditching White Flour (and We Don\u2019t Miss It)At Seylou in Washington, D.C., the directives are clear: No white flour, no white sugar. Pastry chef Charbel Abrache, the brains behind the millet canel\u00e9s, explains why it\u2019s worth all the effort: \u201cOnce you understand the grain, you will end up with something remarkable. The flavor is amazing. When I smell millet, I smell vanilla\u2014it reminds me of cr\u00e8me caramel. Sorghum is more earthy\u2026it works well with spices and chocolate. Sometimes you need rum or bourbon to give flavor to pastries. But I don\u2019t need that anymore\u2014I have all the flavor I need from the grain. There\u2019s no going back.\u201dCoffee in a Cayler Ceramics mug and the sumac-hibiscus-glazed cake from Brooklyn\u2019s Golda.\nPhoto by Alex LauOf Course They Care About the CeramicsIf you\u2019re getting a cortado with your sumac-hibiscus-glazed cake, there\u2019s a decent chance it\u2019s going to come in a custom ceramic mug. Take Brooklyn\u2019s Golda, which teamed up with Calyer Ceramics for the cup shown here, or Seattle\u2019s Sea Wolf Bakers, whose Tesha Karpoff mug will make your croissant brittle taste that much better.Speaking of morning buns...Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurants + TravelPastryTrends + NewsRecipes you want to make.
