Cook chile, garlic, and oil, stirring constantly, until oil starts to shimmer and garlic just begins to turn golden, 60\u201390 seconds. Immediately add asparagus; season lightly with salt. Cook, tossing occasionally, until asparagus is just beginning to brown around the edges, about 2 minutes. Add soy sauce, butter, and 1 Tbsp. water and cook, tossing constantly, until asparagus is still crispy yet cooked through and coated in sauce, about 30 seconds longer.Step 2Remove pan from heat. Finely grate zest from one-quarter of orange over stir-fry. Squeeze juice from one orange half over and toss once more.Step 3Transfer asparagus mixture to a platter. Top with cilantro and sesame seeds. Taste and squeeze more orange juice over if needed.How would you rate Simple and Citrusy Asparagus Stir-Fry?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (9)Back to TopTriangleThe flavors of this dish come together beautifully. The perfect accompaniment to fish, red meat, pork, poultry, or a side of rice. So simple and delicious. Will definitely be making this again, and again. Laura Santa Fe 2/17/2022This is deliciously composed and so simple. I wouldn't call the yield 4 servings though. For a family of 4 to be satisfied, I would suggest doubling the recipe. Will PlattMadison, CT5/18/2021This was surprisingly wonderful.  I had to swap out red chiles for jalapenos and added a few drops of sesame oil instead of the sesame seeds because that's what I had, but it was still great.  I think it would be fabulous with some shiitake mushrooms added in.  Went great with fish.  I will definitely make this again!AnonymousNWPA!5/15/2020A bright & summery side dish! Great, creative way to use up asparagus.AnonymousToronto4/6/2020Be judicious with the cilantro; it can takeover the dish. The orange flavor is niceacookfromdetroit1/2/2020Delicious warm or cold. The orange really brightens this up and pairs well with salmon and rice. Definitely a new go-to!erica_kellySavannah, GA7/24/2019A+ recipe.  Paired it with the peanut noodle recipe that called for tempeh but left the tempeh out and added lots of veg. It was better than any Chinese takeout!  This dish is incredible - great side for any pasta or protein meal and so east but will be a huge hit.  Will keep this in rotation!FlourIsAGirlsBesrFriendBoston5/18/2019The orange zest and juice take this little meal to a whole new level! I was worried that I would just be eating a plate of asparagus but there was so much flavor happening! Andy hit it out of the park, as usual.bstevens94Wenatchee WA5/14/2019So flavorful and fast!
