Yes, you heard me right: \u201cWeeknight\u201d and \u201ccarnitas\u2019 in the same sentence. Using her genius Instant Pot technique, BA Test Kitchen manager Gaby Melian gives us super flavorful, super shreddy, super crisped-up porky tacos for a crowd in a little over an hour. Here are a few things to know.Don\u2019t Freak Out, But You Don\u2019t Need LiquidEvery Instant Pot manual will tell you that you absolutely need to add liquid to whatever you\u2019re pressure cooking. No matter what! That makes sense, because liquid = steam = pressure. But when you\u2019re cooking something that will release tons of its own liquid as it comes to pressure, you actually don\u2019t need to throw in any extra water, broth, beer, whatever. For this recipe, the three pounds of boneless, skinless pork shoulder releases enough liquid (read: juicy faaaat) that the meat essentially self-steams. All that pork\u2014plus garlic, jalape\u00f1os, salt, dried oregano, black pepper, ground coriander, and ground cumin\u2014takes around 15 minutes to come to pressure, and then you\u2019re cooking on high for a mere 35 minutes, instead of the one to two hours it normally takes on the stove.It\u2019s All in the CrispCarnitas are not carnitas if they aren\u2019t crispy. And, unfortunately, that\u2019s one thing the Instant Pot can\u2019t achieve for you. When those 35 minutes are up, you\u2019ll notice that your pile of shreddable pork is sitting in its own fatty, garlicky, spiced juices. But don\u2019t even THINK about tossing out that liquid gold. I almost made that devastating mistake because I thought letting the meat soak in it would make my carnitas soupy. I was wrong. This is your ticket to frying. You need these juices to reach proper crispness in a non-stick pan, because most of it is fat anyway.Yes, You Can Make This AheadBecause you\u2019re cooking the meat in two parts, you can split up the total hour or so of total work over two days. Just put all the shredded meat in a covered bowl in the fridge, and break it out for crisping when taco time approaches. Oh, and just in case you\u2019re impatient like me, the un-crisped pork makes a very good late-night snack. Just saying.The ToppingsCarnitas are a great excuse for tons of toppings. Here\u2019s a running list of quick-and-easy things to serve alongside your tacos: pickled onions, regular chopped onions, limes, avocado, cilantro, pico de gallo, guacamole, crema, and shredded cabbage. Choose your own adventure: It's all going to be damn delicious.Get the recipe:Instant Pot Pork CarnitasIt takes almost zero prep and just 35 minutes of cook time to turn pork shoulder into a tender, shreddy version of itself.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titMexicanInstant PotPorkRecipes you want to make.
