It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Optimism bakingI made Chris Morocco\u2019s buckwheat banana bread at the start of the week, finally. I\u2019d had it pinned for years. I snuck the espresso powder from the frosting into the batter, which is the closest I\u2019ll ever get to working for NASA. I love the way doctoring up a recipe makes you feel like some kind of Mensa genius. \u201cYou know, the soup was perfect as-is, but I added a bay leaf and a cat hair and it simply pushed things over the top!\u201dBake it: Buckwheat Banana CakePhoto by Alex LauIt was a long weekThis week in my (somewhat) quarantined home, an all-out fight broke out about apples. Not like, some Lord of the Flies stuff, but an argument resulting from trying to convince a high-risk loved one that the old way of daily shopping\u2014three avocados here to \u201cripen on deck,\u201d a \u201cbackup\u201d loaf of bread there\u2014is putting us at a potentially higher risk, putting others in the city at risk, and frankly unnecessary considering our stocked pantry. That maybe even this high-risk person...shouldn\u2019t be doing the shopping at all.It didn\u2019t work. Suddenly the boring, chore-y act of popping in a store and feeling a few \u2018cados for ripeness seems to represent all that\u2019s left of free will.And I know I\u2019m not the only one in this unnecessary feud. It\u2019s been written about in The New Yorker. A friend asked me if I had any good talking points she could give her dad, who\u2019s running errands around town like it\u2019s Normal Times. \u201cThey didn\u2019t work!\u201d I lamented. I\u2019m exhausted and unfunny right now. But I\u2019m hoping for the best.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Photo by Hilary CadiganThe pantry depthsThis week, Bon App\u00e9tit staffers mined their pantries for treasure and this is what they excavated:Hilary Cadigan popped open a bottle of...Ikea ketchup. \u201cI like the Nordic simplicity of the bottle,\u201d she reviewed, \u201cand it\u2019s a teensy bit on the sweet side but overall well-balanced, with a nice spice action\u2014you can actually SEE the spices suspended in the goop.\u201dI dug out Runamok\u2019s coffee-infused (!) maple syrup and drizzled it over that banana bread mentioned earlier, crisped up in a cast-iron with butter.Jesse Sparks found spicy cocoa powder he\u2019s going to experiment with. Cookies? Hot cocoa?Christina Chaey discovered a ton of roasted seaweed sheets. One package was rancid (\u201cif you're wondering how I knew, YOU KNOW\u201d) but she\u2019s going to use the rest to practice her onigiri technique.MacKenzie Fegan unearthed her fianc\u00e9e\u2019s ex\u2019s \u201cenormous payload of gluten-free pasta and noodles, plus one box of gluten-free Bisquick\u201d in her cabinets. \u201cThe most upsetting item is this \u2018shirataki spaghetti,\u2019 which is made from the type of yam that my family was forced to eat for survival during the Cultural Revolution in China. It comes packaged in a liquid-filled sac.\u201dAliza Abarbanel shrugged and made a smoothie with CBD-infused honey packets. \u201cYes, I'm a parody of myself.\u201dChris Morocco\u2019s all about Patak's Mango Chutney. \u201cDamn, with some curry, daal, basmati, etc...it brightens everything and gives lovely sweetness.\u201dA Zoom of one\u2019s ownWhen you tell Andy a joke and he tries to hide his reaction:(Courtesy of Christina Chaey)When your internet connection slows because everyone\u2019s working from home at the same time:Sohla, tell me about those oystersOn Instagram this week, I saw Sohla El-Waylly cracking open a pile of OYSTERS. WHAT. SOHLA. HOW. The celebratory scene stemmed from a sad one. Her husband\u2019s restaurants closed this week and everyone was laid off. The employees divided ribeyes, oysters, all the good stuff. It was a small consolation. \u201cIt helped to have a good night in a sad situation,\u201d she said.Read more: Here\u2019s how you can support the restaurants you love right nowPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Judy ManciniQuaran...tiniPeople I love keep sending me \u201cquarantini\u201d memes and I can\u2019t help but find the name catchy. My ...quarantini... has been actually going to the trouble of shaking my margarita in a shaker instead of simply squeezing lime over tequila. This is the cocktail equivalent of putting jeans on to work from home. How considered. How decent.Get the recipe: MargaritaPhoto by Gentl & HyersPantry pankoI made one of the best simple pastas this week, a 2017 Andy Baraghani recipe, for bucatini with swiss chard (or whatever greens) and a topping of garlicky breadcrumbs. That extra step, tossing panko with garlic until it smells absurdly good, is something I\u2019d normally be too lazy to do.
