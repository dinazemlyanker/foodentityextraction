But this summer-vegetable \u201ccassoulet\u201d requires only a spin through the produce section and a bit of free time. Instead of the traditional sausage and duck leg confit, this version skips meat altogether in favor of spiced eggplant, tomato, green beans, and big white beans cooked with plenty of extra-virgin olive oil, fresh herbs, and garlic. And rather than traditional breadcrumbs,\u00a0 Gruy\u00e8re, baked until golden and crisp, then crumbled over, adds texture, depth, and plenty of umami (plus they\u2019re just plain fun). Vegetarians can skip the optional anchovy paste, but if you haven\u2019t explored this ingredient, it\u2019s incomparable for adding flavor. \u2014Christian ReynosoAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I nervously made this for my French grandparents today and felt very relieved when they all said it tasted wonderful and asked me what the dish was called. I did not tell them it was a cassoulet because they are very traditional  and would no dout have protested that I was butchering a classic... but as long as you don't call it a cassoulet, its a great dish.LCSunshine9/22/2021My three criteria for awesome recipes: Amazing & interesting flavors, ingredients that are not complicated to source, and can be put together quickly. I made it as written and we loved it. Leftovers (what little we had) were possibly more delicious the next day. I'm about to make it again tonight, this time making several additions/ substitutions to clean out the refrigerator. Wish me luck!Magnolia MerSeattle, WA9/17/2021First, it\u2019s as much a cassoulet as it is a g\u00fcve\u00e7, or any classic dish named for the vessel it\u2019s cooked in. Next, as for the vegetables, what about mushrooms, onions, okra, and whatever else works well with eggplant? The crispy gruy\u00e8re is cutesy, but I prefer the breadcrumb/panko/grated cheese topping. The crispy gruy\u00e8re would be nice on the side for people to add as they like.\n\nI\u2019ve made cassoulet, and the only ingredients that are evocative of that classic dish are garlic, beans, and anchovies. Please consider the dish before you throw classic names around. As a vegetable casserole, however, it\u2019s okay but I\u2019d add onions, mushrooms, and okra at the very least.Hollis RamseyVero Beach, FL9/6/2021loved the spiced eggplant as a sausage nod. Also, I've never crisped up cheese in the oven like this before. Was fun to watch it go from shards to melted shards to crisp and golden. It's like a cheesy cracker. AnonymousSF, CA9/5/2021this is not a cassoulet. shame on youcavefishKCMO9/5/2021Healthy, yet unctuous. This recipe packs all my summer favorite vegetables in one delicious dish. So easy to make (a one pot wonder) with tons of flavors from the anchovies and the gruyere. Perfect to entertain since you'll have extra time to mingle and drink while it cooks.Simone CastorNew York, NY9/2/2021This recipe is incredible. I cannot believe that so much flavor could come from mere vegetables. Even better on day two!Tim TLos Angeles, CA9/2/2021I\u2019m having seconds! Easy peasy and hearty with a refined edge. \nP.S. Did I just get a full serving of vegetables? Louise P.Boston, MA8/30/2021Delicious and easy, but appears fancy and complicated. Perfect for impressing guests or bringing to a party - I did the latter and it still tasted great at room temp. Creamy beans, silky eggplant, and crunchy cheese make a satisfying texture combo, and it's almost impossible to go wrong with an anchovy-garlic-tomato sauce element. Looking forward to making this again, maybe with bread or pasta as a main.AnonymousPortland, OR8/30/2021As a pescatarian, I absolutely love this recipe! It\u2019s filling and super satisfying while also feeling balanced and healthful. A new favorite! Kimberly Joplin, MO8/30/2021I made this for my girlfriend and I yesterday. It was pretty bomb. I really liked the crispy gruyere cheese and glad I had leftovers to put in a salad today. Never made tradition cassoulet, but this one made me feel cheffy. Great weekend dinner. \n\nOne thing: wanted a touch more sauce, so I\u2019ll probably try adding a little bit more liquid next time. Heath Kelley Los Angeles 8/30/2021Really good. However, I make traditional Cassoulet & I love the unctuous blending of all the tender, long-cooked ingredients. This is NOT it! I did not do the Gruyere topping, but opted for more bean-cooking liquid & a breadcrumb/cheese topping. I put it all together in the baking dish, mixed it, applied the topping & baked it until the crumbs were crusty. A great dish for my garden plethora of eggplant, tomatoes & green beans!LynnNeenah, WI8/29/2021We made this for my birthday and it was fabulous! Keep these great recipes coming. ShelleSt. Petersburg, FL 8/29/2021I'd like to understand why the whole dish isn't finished in the oven and made with fewer steps?  Perhaps the cheese could go on top of the vegetable raw, then broiled in top third of oven to get the crispy effect (instead of applying like frosting at the end.)  I ask because I like to do a lot of prep ahead of time, before guest/s arrive.   Now I realize I've painted myself into a corner with room temp eggplant and the haricots verts, cherry tomatoes, etc lukewarm in the pot. Also, since I had trouble getting the little tomatoes to pop, I overcooked the canned beans. I haven't tasted this yet -- sorry -- so no helpful advice about the finished product  from me. Just questions.  Did anyone modify the cooking methods here?  .  KeekWoodland Park, NJ8/27/2021I made this exactly as written. It's delicious! Next time I would use soaked dry beans instead of canned to avoid mushy beans. Add warm sour dough baguette too.
