Welcome to the weird and wonderful culture shift that\u2019s changing the way we drink.By Alex DelanyMay 2, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPHOTO BY ALEX LAU, FOOD STYLING BY REBECCA JURKEVICH, PROP STYLING BY KALEN KAMINSKIFacebookTwitterEmailI used to be a beer guy. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m still a beer guy, but I used to be just a beer guy. I made it a mission to familiarize myself with style guidelines and tap lists. I cemented my identity as a beer guy. But then I tried cider. And everything changed.On a trip to Vermont a few years ago, I was introduced to Fable Farm,1 and I pulled a U-turn on the whole \u201ccider is just sweet boozy apple juice\u201d thing. The stuff I drank from the 750-ml bottle was bone-dry. It was made from wild apples, unfiltered, labeled \u201capple wine,\u201d and tasted the way I wished wine did\u2014equal parts fruit, acid, and funk. I like cider now, I thought, as the course of my drinking life was silently altered.If something like this weird cider existed, I reasoned, there ought to be wine that followed suit. And after learning of the style from BA\u2019s wine columnist Marissa Ross, I ended up purchasing a bottle of pe\u0301t-nat from Oyster River Winegrowers. The bottle was sealed with a crown cap instead of a cork. The pink label looked hand-drawn. And the wine itself tasted like the softly carbonated unfiltered ciders I\u2019d been exploring. I was a late adopter, but hey, I eventually made it to the world of natural wine. And it was then that I started to notice that as the wine, beer, and cider that I drank got more rebellious, they also became more and more similar to one another.P\u00e9t-Nat: A naturally sparkling wine that is bottled before fermentation finishes. The last bit of yeast activity carbonates the wine in the bottle, creating softer bubbles than those in Champagne. Can be cloudy, bready, and casual in the most drinkable way.

Frequency Illusion: Skin Contact, $20\nPhoto by Alex Lau\u201cGive me something fun to drink.\u201d That\u2019s what I say when I walk into a bottle shop with an obscure selection or a bar I\u2019ve seen importers posting about on the internet. I want something that will excite me, that will pull me further from what I used to know as wine, beer, and cider. And in return, I get wines that taste like sucking on grape and cherry Jolly Ranchers at the same time. I get still, fruitless beers that drink like I\u2019m eating honeydew while lounging on a bed of hay. I get bright, floral ciders with flavors of lemon rind, ginger, and apricot. A co-ferment of beer and blueberry juice that tastes like a savory Lambrusco? That\u2019s what gets me out of bed in the morning. (Just kidding. It\u2019s my job.)The wines, beers, and ciders I used to drink were all about controlled fermentation. A specific yeast was added to produce a predictable product. The common thread that runs through what I drink now is that they\u2019re fermented with wild or natural yeast, organisms that deliver livelier, more complex flavors than industrial yeast. It\u2019s what makes these drinks so anarchic. At their purest form, they\u2019re fermented spontaneously without any added yeast at all. The entire process is left up to the yeast and bacteria on the fruit or in the air. It makes these drinks taste like they\u2019re alive.Still: Beer isn\u2019t always effervescent. And neither is cider. Some producers skip a secondary fermentation in the bottle, which carbonates the liquid. The lack of bubbles makes beer or cider drink more like a wine.

Tastes like more than the sum of its parts. Tired Hands Brewing Co. Frequency Illusion: Bluecrop, $20.\nPhoto by Alex Lau\u201cAs we embrace more natural and spontaneous ferments and an ever-increasing hybridization of wine, beer, and cider, we\u2019ll see the lines of each beverage become increasingly blurred until there\u2019s nothing left but a tapestry of existence swaying in the life-giving breeze,\u201d waxes Tired Hands Brewing Co. founder Jean Broillet, whose beer-wine hybrids are almost as poetic as his view on the industry.American producers are defying the categories in which their products have lived for decades. Brewers are obsessed with grapes, adding them to beers to make fruity, high-acid ales. Winemakers don\u2019t care about clarity, leaving wines unfiltered. Cider producers are using wild apple varieties without names. None of them are fulfilling old stereotypes, of the Teva-clad craft brewer or the Robert Parker\u2013obsessed winemaker. And they\u2019re all working in small batches, offering the chance to take more risks. People are doing whatever they want, and it\u2019s translating into drinks more thought-provoking and progressive than anything we\u2019ve had before. If I say, \u201cGive me something fun to drink,\u201d I\u2019ll get it.But most of the time I don\u2019t even need to say anything. I can just look at the bottles. If they\u2019re adorned with an especially rad label...if they\u2019re sealed with a crown cap...if they look murky or possess an unexpected hue...if they\u2019re fermented with wild yeast...if they\u2019re bottled by a small producer...if they\u2019re made from apples or grapes or malt, I\u2019m in. Because I\u2019m not a beer guy anymore. I love it all.For the naturally and spontaneously fermented bottles we\u2019re stocking\u2014and re-stocking\u2014read on below1 / 17ChevronChevronPhoto by Alex LauFable Farm Fermentory LeoWine-cider blend; $22\nA blend of Vermont apple and grape wines, this could be confused for the most perfectly balanced sparkling orange wine you\u2019ve ever had.
