Cut the top off the garlic bulb and place on top of a piece of foil. Drizzle the garlic with olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper. Enclose the garlic head in the foil and roast for 25-30 minutes on a small sheet tray, until garlic cloves are soft and golden.Drizzle the jalape\u00f1os with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place onto a separate small foil-lined sheet pan and roast for 25-30 minutes, or until the jalape\u00f1o skin is charred and bubbly. Remove from oven and let jalape\u00f1os cool.
