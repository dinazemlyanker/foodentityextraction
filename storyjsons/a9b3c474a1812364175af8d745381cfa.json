I really like how the warmth of the roasted chickpeas and cauliflower (and their spices) balances the cool crispness of the fennel salad, and how the lemony yoghurt brings everything together. \n\nI made the recipe as written, though I seeded the jalape\u00f1o, because otherwise there\u2019s a bit too much heat for me. Another reviewer mentioned serving this with rice and bread; I can\u2019t really recommend that. Husband and I enjoy this, just as is, as our entire dinner. It\u2019s healthy, tasty, filling, and easy to make. What more could you want?Anonymous1/27/2022delicious - I personally like fennel cooked, so i cooked it w a tsp of oil for a few mins. Anonymous1/18/2022Wonderful! I just made this for the first time. I've never used fennel in a dish, and I was initially put off by the licoricey taste. But, tossed in the lemon with parsley and chili, it was transformative in this dish. The lemony yogurt was a great addition. I ended up finishing the cauliflower and chickpeas in the broiler for a few minutes to get a nice crisp, but other than that I made no adjustments. This is a very healthy, feel-good dish that doesn't compromise on flavor or texture. This will definitely be on my regular work lunch rotations! AnnelisaChicago, IL1/17/2022As written, this recipe is somewhat bland.  The reviews are very good, but you\u2019ll notice that almost all reviewers report having modified the recipe\u2014 in some cases pretty significantly.  I liked the idea of this recipe, but as written, it is lacking.  It screamed out for some sort of sauce.  The yogurt is nice, but overall the meal felt dry and bland.  I served it with basmati rice and flatbread.  I ended up increasing the salt and spices quite a bit to try to liven it up Maybe some chutney on the side would have helped, because to me it really needed a sweet element.  I would not make this again.Anonymous1/10/2022This dish makes my heart sing! It's just fantastic. I live in spicy chile pepper land, NM, so next time I will keep the jalape\u00f1o seeds or upgrade to a hotter variety. Looking forward to sharing it with more friends!\nKathleen B.Albuquerque, NM6/3/2021Delicious!\n\nThe warm cauliflower and the chickpeas, together with the cold sour salty yogurt and the warm spices.. OH MAMA! it's SO GOOD!\nHere's what I added/changed: I threw my chopped fennel slices with some olive oil in a pan, medium-high heat, give it a couple minutes. It brings out a nice and subtle sweetness from the fennel. If you don't have fresh chili, this is a great time to add some chili flakes to the fennel, I feel like the heat helps to increase the chili flavor and not the hotness (Maybe I'm wrong but eh). And I added some sumac to the yogurt, too (making Brad proud!). If you have sumac, add a little bit less lemon juice and add some sumac instead! You can add lime juice, too! This dish is so versatile yet so simple, and I love it!\n\nGreat stuff Andy, your recipes rock!Maciej M.Austria2/18/2021This was so delicious. Like other commenters, I'd never cooked with fennel before, but it totally mellows out with the lemon juice and other flavors. Really lovely light and tasty dish. Looks so beautiful on the plate too. Thanks Andy!EmilyNorth Carolina11/9/2020Delicious, light, quick/easy to make, and even better on flatbread!! I subbed broccoli for cauliflower, used a whole head and used double the cumin-coriander. It was so surprisingly delicious I almost shed a tear? Don\u2019t knock the fennel before you try it- this combination is genius.  AnonymousTexas10/23/2020Let me start off by saying I do not care for anise flavor - no black liquorice, no sambuca, no fennel. Why I chose this recipe is a mystery but I can say now my taste for anise may have been changed. Maybe it was the chili/lemon marinade or the tart lemon yogurt but the recipe turned our delicious. My wife, also not a big anise fan, loved it too. My 11yr old daughter, not so much; though she did eat up the spiced cauliflower & chickpeas. fitzrobAustin, TX8/6/2020This is delicious! We added a little mango chutney to the yoghurt, and in lieu of sesame seeds used pine nuts instead. Served with some toasted pitta for dinner, otherwise it may have been a little too light for us. Still well under 500kcals. Definitely will make again, perhaps with some shredded chicken or roasted squash to bulk it out.ScotLondLondon6/16/2020This is delicious and healthy. I make this every few weeks to balance out all the carbs that have been getting me through the quarantine. It's very filling! Anonymous5/26/2020This was so good! Very easy to make and healthy. I will definitely make this again. Hannah_RosalieThe Netherlands5/25/2020This is in my heavy rotation. The concept of this dish lends itself well to modifications depending on what is in your fridge. Adding lemon and salt to the yogurt is surprisingly transformative...I really like it. Go wild with the spices and oil on the vegetables and chickpeas if you want a really flavorful and textured crust on the chickpeas. I was sad I didn't have fennel this last time I made it. Instead I had to used radishes, jalapeno, green onion, parsley, lemon and sesame oil, to make the salad. It did it's job of brightening up the dish. Thank you for this recipe!Anonymouslos angeles, CA5/9/2020I make this dish a couple times a month now, it is amazing. You can sub out any sweet veggie that roasts well in place of the cauliflower, too.\n\nWhen I'm not trying to be healthyish, I really enjoy putting these toppings on a toasted flatbread!!hamsliceMKE4/25/2020excellent dish! I didn't have all of the correct ingredients on hand, so subbed some out and it was still a nice fresh, light meal. jolieangelineaustin, texas4/8/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titRice and Grain BowlChickpeaBeanVegetableCauliflowerFennelFallWinterQuickEasyWeeknight MealsMainGluten-FreeVegetarianHealthyishLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
