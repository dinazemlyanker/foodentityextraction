A healthy shot of cocktail bitters at the end does wonders. The flavors of the herbs and botanicals in the bitters complement the natural floral sweetness of ripe fruit.IngredientsMakes about 1 pint18oz. fresh raspberries (about 5 cups)1\u00bccups sugar1Tbsp. finely grated orange zest2Tbsp. fresh orange juice2Tbsp. fresh lemon juice1Tbsp. Angostura bittersSpecial EquipmentA 1-pint jarPreparationStep 1Place a small plate in the freezer. Bring raspberries, sugar, orange zest, orange juice, and lemon juice to a simmer in a large saucepan, stirring gently to dissolve sugar. Once sugar is dissolved, increase heat and boil, skimming foam from surface often, until mixture is reduced by a little more than a third and bottom of pot is visible when stirring, 15\u201320 minutes.Step 2Dab a tablespoonful of jam onto frozen plate and freeze 1 minute. Drag a finger through jam to see if it wrinkles. If it does, remove saucepan from heat and stir in bitters. If jam doesn\u2019t wrinkle, keep cooking, testing again every minute until it is does. Transfer jam to jar, cover, and let cool. Chill until ready to use.Step 3Do Ahead: Jam can be made 2 months ahead. Keep chilled.Photo by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca JurkevichHow would you rate Raspberry Jam with Bitters?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkExplore Bon App\u00e9titCondimentSpreadsJamRaspberryBerryFruitSummerEasyDairy-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreeVeganVegetarianPickle and PreserveRecipes you want to make.
