Spears, it\u2019s classic for a reason. And that reason is: It\u2019s perfect. Prosecco, Aperol, club soda, an orange wedge. No night that began with an Aperol spritz has ever ended in murder and mayhem. I think. But, for the sake of moving time forward and having a bit of fun, we came up with six spritz recipes that follow the easy formula of:base + bubbles + more bubbles + garnishBut instead of your usual Prosecco, club soda, etc, we\u2019re playing with Amaro combined with the nose-hair-tingling bubbles of cherry soda and Lambrusco. There\u2019s the crowd-pleaser Campari, sparkling ros\u00e9, and lemon soda. And the weird, slightly savory one you didn\u2019t see coming but can\u2019t stop sipping, Pimm\u2019s and Cel-Ray soda (the test kitchen\u2019s favorite). Cynar and grapefruit soda?! Don\u2019t mind if I do. (The sweet-bitter combo is super refreshing after a long summer\u2019s day of poolside napping.) The thing here is, you need to try all five to truly decide which spritz is right for you.Spritz 101Combine 2 oz. liqueur and 3 oz. sparkling wine in an ice-filled glass+Top with a splash of soda and stir gently to combine.+Garnish optional but highly recommended (grapefruit zest, a slice of peeled ginger, a cherry on top never hurt).Memorize: The 2:3 ratio of liqueur to sparkling wine. Everything else will fall into place\u2014in your glass.Get the recipes:Cynar SpritzSweet, citrusy grapefruit pairs well with herbaceous Cynar, and adding dry Prosecco provides balance.View RecipeSpiced Cherry SpritzA cherry cola spritz\u2014for adults.View RecipePimm\u2019s SpritzCel-Ray (celery soda) and Pimm\u2019s make an unsuspecting great pair in this easy spritz.View RecipeCampari SpritzSparkling ros\u00e9 and lemon soda complement the citrusy flavor of Campari and make for a beautifully vibrant cocktail.View RecipeAperol SpritzThis classic combo should be credited with starting the whole spritz phenomenon in the United States.View RecipeGinger SpritzGinger beer and bubbly cava were meant to be together.View RecipeOr try this classic from last summer:Explore Bon App\u00e9titCocktailAperolCampariSummer DrinksRead MorecultureThe Ros\u00e9-Aperol Spritz Is Your Drink of SummerBy Alex BeggscultureShrubs, Spritzes, and Swizzles: Everything You Need to Make Summer's Coolest CocktailsBy Belle Cushingrecipes32 Wine Cocktails, Because You Need More Summer WaterGallery32 SlidesBy Elyssa GoldbergRecipes you want to make.
