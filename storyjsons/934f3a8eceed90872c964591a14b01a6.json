You know that\u2019s what happens, right? THEN WE EAT THE FISH AND THE LITTLE PLASTICS. In my most skeptical moments\u2014especially after watching this John Oliver segment about how corporations don\u2019t give more than a PR hoot about their plastic waste\u2014I\u2019m like, it\u2019s too late. We ruined everything. But that\u2019s a terrible way to think. We (people + corporations) can all use less plastic, period. It\u2019s easier than ever.The truth about \u201ccompostable\u201d and \u201cbiodegradable\u201d goods, though, is that many of them are probably not going to turn into mulch in your backyard tomato pots. Some of these new products need to go to commercial composting facilities to be processed. Luckily, many cities have these facilities, including mine, Ann Arbor. Shout out to the giant stinky compost bin that\u2019s bigger than my garbage bin, swarmed by flies in my driveway. Love that guy.These new kitchen products are cool and compostable. Check \u2018em out, and write your city council rep so you can get a sweet, stinky compost bin like mine.Compostic Cling WrapA new company, Compostic, sent me their green-tinted cling wrap (they also make compostable not-plastic bags) to try out and I was wary it wouldn\u2019t hold a beeswax candle to my Glad wrap. But it\u2019s certifiably clingy. The jagged edge where you rip off the wrap isn\u2019t as sharp, making tearing each perforated sheet a little tricky, a little annoying. (I get why\u2014the box itself can be composted.) Unlike other compostable goods, this wrap can actually break down in your backyard bin \u201cfaster than an orange peel,\u201d according to the company. I wrap cheese chunks in it.Compostic Cling Wrap$24 at AmazonClorox Compostable Cleaning WipesAfter a record-breaking year selling out of wipes to stockpiling customers, Clorox came back to the market with a new compostable version of their handy cleaning wipes. These are made of \u201chydrated silica\u201d and \u201cplant-based cloth.\u201d No word yet on what plant that is, but these can go in your backyard compost if they make up no more than 10 percent of your compost pile. (A gross side note: you can\u2019t compost these if you use them to clean up non-compostable stuff like cat barf or potty-training...messes.)Clorox Compostable Cleaning Wipes$22 at Amazon \u2013 Pack of 3Food52 Sponge ClothsAlso known as \u201cSwedish dishcloths,\u201d these plant-fiber-based, spongy, super-absorbent cloths are my favorite thing to wipe down my kitchen counters with because they don\u2019t leave puddles like some OTHER sponges. They get a little gnarly, a little gray, after a few weeks of use, but you can toss them in the laundry to revive \u2018em. When they really die, you can compost them (either backyard or municipal).Photo by Ty Mecham/Food52Food52 Compostable Sponge Cloths$49 at Food52 \u2013 Set of 10Responsible Products Zippered BagsYou have approximated 347 options for anything-but-Ziploc-bags now, from silicone Zip Top bags to remember jam jars? But certain situations demand something lightweight, reliably zippy, and okay-if-it-gets-tossed (group snacks, field trips, etc.). Responsible\u2019s zippered bags feel like crumply real plastic, are tinted green, and get the job done. These cannot go in backyard compost bins, so make sure to dispose of them with your city or municipality. Responsible also makes plates, to-go cups and containers, garbage bags, and utensils, and they offer wholesale quantities for businesses or someone throwing a party for 1000.Responsible Products Zippered Bags$15 at AmazonZero Waste Club Coconut Scrub PadsIt\u2019s hard to find an eco-friendly sponge out there that can compete with what-can\u2019t-she-do Scrub Mommy. But these coconut husk scrubbers are closing in. They\u2019re biodegradable, and while they look tough, they won\u2019t scratch your dishes. One reviewer boldly says, \u201cI will not go back to sponge.\u201d Note, these might shed a bit\u2014but that\u2019s what sink strainers are for. For tougher crusted-on gunk in your pans, try a bamboo scraper with a clever rounded edge that our art director loves (no shedding!).Coconut Scrub Pads$7 at Zero Waste Outlet \u2013 Pack of 5Knork FlatwareThis bamboo + sugarcane flatware is very cute and comes in the happiest blue\u2014but it also takes two years to compost, something to consider when deciding how you\u2019ll use \u2018em. On the other hand, because they\u2019re so sturdy, you can actually throw these in the dishwasher, and Food52 says they can handle around 400 washes. These would have come in handy when I had my nieces over and one took my stainless steel Sabre fork and started stabbing the brick patio. Give that kid some compostable flatware!Photo by Ty Mecham/Food52Reusable and Biodegradable Astrik Flatware$48 at Food52Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingSustainableRecipes you want to make.
