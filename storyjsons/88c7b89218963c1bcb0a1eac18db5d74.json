These were just a bonus. I had to check out MeMe\u2019s because this restaurant is, well, super gay.MeMe\u2019s Diner, a new Brooklyn restaurant specializing in comfort foods like meatloaf, patty melts, and Velveeta mac and cheese stands in contrast with nearly every other buzzy opening. Expensive handmade ceramic plates are nowhere in sight, and the kitchen isn\u2019t shy about using Heinz and Hellmann\u2019s in lieu of artisanal substitutes. These are the foods we want to eat\u2014let\u2019s face it, all the time\u2014but especially on long, lazy weekend afternoons at tables crowded with your friends.Noah FecksMeMe\u2019s was born out of a pair of friends\u2019 love for entertaining and hospitality. After working together at Ovenly, a Brooklyn bakery known for its vegan chocolate chip cookies and blackout cake, Bill Clark left with the dream of opening a Brooklyn bar, while Libby Willis started a catering company. The duo began hosting dinner parties in Brooklyn, which eventually became the model for MeMe\u2019s, their first restaurant together. Beyond serving playful dishes like brunch-time migas served in a sliced-open Fritos bag, the diner was created as a beacon of queer hospitality. Guests would be treated like friends or acquaintances dining in the founders\u2019 homes, and staff would be treated with the same respect Willis, Clark, and countless other out LGBTQ+ restaurant workers deserve.Willis and Clark.\nNoah Fecks\u201cThe hospitality industry is hard, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be. We want to come to work and be happy,\u201d Clark says. He and Willis, a third-generation restaurateur (all her relatives told her not to do it), opened the door to MeMe\u2019s in late 2017 with no advertising or formal PR\u2014just the \u201cgay whisper network.\u201d Tables and barstools remain packed throughout dinner each night and especially during brunch on weekends. MeMe\u2019s has already lapped up acclaim and media attention that countless larger, more established and hyped-up New York restaurants only hope for. In an era of dwindling LGBTQ+ spaces, MeMe\u2019s champions queerness in an inclusive, progressive, practical way, infusing equality in every aspect of the restaurant\u2019s operations.In some ways, the strategy is formulaic. MeMe\u2019s menu offers tasteful, unpretentious food in a gentrifying neighborhood (Prospect Heights). The dining room, with its tufted brown-leather banquettes (crafted by Willis\u2019 Hudson Valley\u2013dwelling brother), artsy oil portraits of strangers (painted by Willis\u2019 grandfather and rescued from his barn), and unfinished-wood shelves displaying Mastering the Art of French Cooking, evokes the seemingly effortless blend of \u201cchill\u201d that every restaurant is chasing in 2018. At its core, MeMe\u2019s, named after Clark\u2019s grandmother, is what a restaurant opening in today\u2019s Brooklyn looks like, but at its heart, it\u2019s a proudly queer space. \u201cWe\u2019re not just a queer space [or] an exclusively gay space\u2014we\u2019re a space for everybody, [run] by gays,\u201d Clark says.Queerness is organically infused into every element of MeMe\u2019s hospitality, from the gender-neutral greeting (think: \u201cWelcome, folks\u201d rather than \u201cHey, ladies\u201d) when diners walk in, to not questioning someone\u2019s gender identity when it comes to a credit card or ID that may not match their appearance, to Willis\u2019 zero tolerance policy for deprecating language in the kitchen. On a recent evening, the restaurant quickly filled up with LGBTQ+ couples and families, along with a handful of straight-presenting couples; several groups of friends crowded in the doorway in hopes of getting a seat. In the small bubble of NYC\u2019s queer social circle, it felt to me that there was a high likelihood someone you knew would walk in the door at any time.\u201cWhen we talk about queer hospitality, this is less about making a traditional gay bar or a space for gay people,\u201d Clark says, \u201cbut we\u2019re creating a very welcoming, easy, and desirable place for queer people to work in. When your staff is comfortable and not worried about not being able to be themselves or express who they are as people, that translates directly to your hospitality.\u201dThe peanut butter pie at Meme\u2019s.\nPhoto by Noah FecksWillis and Clark operate off an inherent sense of how they\u2019d want to be treated at work, knowing that tolerance for inappropriate behavior often trickles from the top down. \u201cAs a femme-presenting female, male coworkers and owners saw me as a sexual object first,\u201d Willis says of her prior experience. \u201cAnd then when they found out I was queer, they would suggest I just hadn\u2019t met the right man yet and that if they had it their way I would absolutely be straight. Working in an environment where you have to constantly out yourself and shut down sexual harassment is exhausting.\u201dMeanwhile Clark felt the \u201cculture of competitive masculinity\u201d ingrained in professional kitchens and feared appearing \u201csoft or weak at work,\u201d especially since he focused on pastry rather than on the more-masculine-deemed grill station. All potential MeMe\u2019s employees are informed that the company culture is rooted in queer inclusion and compassion. \u201cIf people seem to not get it right away and don\u2019t understand why it is so important in the interview process, they are probably not right for this restaurant,\u201d Willis says.Willis doesn\u2019t prioritize hiring women or LGBTQ+ people, necessarily, though her original team was built through a network of friends and supplemented by workers from GOSO (Getting Out and Staying Out), a program that helps formerly incarcerated men transition back into life in New York.The goal is that the restaurant becomes a neighborhood staple, \u201cwhere you can pop in a couple nights a week, get a plate of meatloaf and some greens or a big supper salad,\u201d Clark says. And so far, it is. \u201cIt\u2019s really shocking how quickly we had regulars.\u201d The storefront that houses MeMe\u2019s stood empty for more than two decades, and the fact that a proudly LGBTQ+ partnership and business model infused a new, nonstop energy into the space shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. The restaurant business is undeniably tough, and New York restaurants, as most businesses do, rely on straight people to stay in business. Despite the massive progress LGBTQ+ people have achieved in recent years, latent and blatant discrimination is still prevalent. MeMe\u2019s has to face all of that as well as the lingering stigma that a gay space is for gay people only.To bring the LGBTQ+ food community closer together, the second Monday of every month MeMe\u2019s hosts a \u201cFamily Meal\u201d (only drinks and the bar\u2019s signature complimentary cheese puffs are served) to which LGBTQ+ people working in the food and restaurant industry are invited to network and mingle in the otherwise closed restaurant until 2 a.m. Ideally, the values that launched MeMe\u2019s business will trickle out to restaurant workers across the city.\u201cIt\u2019s a space for everyone who understands what you\u2019re going through, like-minded people,\u201d Willis says. \u201cThe best way to change is through community. Maybe someone will pay attention and go back to where they\u2019re working and say, \u2018Hey, I know that other people do this differently. Can we try to be different?\u2019 The best way to do that is to be an example, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to be.\u201dRelated: Let Hamburger Mary\u2019s Take Over the WorldExplore Bon App\u00e9titBrooklynRestaurants + TravelNew YorkRead Moreculture'Battle of the Sexes' Star Natalie Morales Is Queer, Vegetarian, Cuban, and ProudBy Alyse WhitneycultureHamburger Mary's: The Drag Queen Burger Joint That's Planning World DominationBy Melissa KravitzPhotography by Amy LombardcultureA History of Meatloaf, Long May It ReignBy Frank Bruni and Jennifer SteinhauerRecipes you want to make.
