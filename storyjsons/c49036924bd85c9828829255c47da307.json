It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Anyone who has listened to my segments on the Bon App\u00e9tit Foodcast or watched my pasta e fagiole video or bought my cookbook knows that my mom, Carole Lalli, is the reason why I cook. She\u2019s also the reason why I grill, and on the 4th of July, she and I will assert our culinary independence by harnessing live fire together.I never understood the whole \u201cmanning the grill\u201d stereotype\u2014that was a thing that happened in TV commercials but was never witnessed at my house. My father, who is an excellent person and a very well-fed husband, didn\u2019t cook anything indoors, so it would have been really weird if all of a sudden he grabbed a box of matches and ran outside to light a charcoal fire. He knew it, too, and had no qualms about standing down. \u201cI\u2019ll man the beer,\u201d he\u2019d say. I loved watching my mom stand on the deck next to our Weber, one hand on her hip, the other holding a pair of tongs, glowing coals sending smoke swirling around her, while she calmly and confidently handled flare-ups like a boss. Real women grill, that seemed pretty clear. She grilled pizzas and lamb chops, chicken and sausages, lamb ribs, baby artichokes, and even our Thanksgiving turkey. And she literally never broke a sweat, which might have been the most amazing part.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!The BA Smash BurgerView RecipeMy mom\u2019s love of grilling eventually migrated indoors. She got a Tuscan Grill and set it up in her fireplace, and she and my dad would eat Florentine-style steaks in the winter. Eventually she got to build her dream kitchen, and installed a double-wide indoor grill that we love. (The Weber is still on the patio, and sometimes I feel bad that we don\u2019t pay more attention to it.) I\u2019ll be with my parents for the 4th, and in a rare turn of events, it will just be the four of us. My kids are at sleepaway camp, and my sister is road-tripping with her husband and baby, and the family text-thread devoted to our communal meal-planning is strangely quiet.I\u2019ve been texting with my mom instead, keeping the weekend plans on the DL. We\u2019re tracking the weather, we\u2019re making plans to eat watermelon, and she\u2019s updating me with farm stand reports. Most recently, she sent me this:\u201cOoooh\u2014should we have hot dogs and hamburgers on Thursday?!\u201dWhen the woman who could cook anything suggests the most stereotypical menu for the 4th of July, it sounds the best. We\u2019re going to put a cast-iron skillet on the grill for smash burgers, and I\u2019m going to pick up my favorite hot dogs on the way out of town, and someone will make coleslaw. While I can\u2019t singlehandedly bring our country together, I am nonetheless inspired by this holiday\u2019s origin story\u2014you know, how a bunch of people banded together to overthrow the monarchy. In this case, it\u2019ll be me and my mom womanning the grill, overthrowing gender assumptions. And we know the food\u2019s going to be good\u2014because we\u2019re the ones cooking it.The Recipes BA Staffers Are Cooking This Weekend:1 / 14ChevronChevronTandoori Chicken WingsView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterFourth Of JulyGrillRead MorecookingI Thought the Smash Burger Couldn\u2019t Get Better\u2014Then I Tried ThisBy Adam RapoportcookingWhy Aren't We Grilling More Pork Shoulder Steaks?By Adam RapoportcookingEnough with the Ridiculous Extra-Long Grill Tools Already!By Amiel StanekLifestyleWe'll Be Drinking Co-Fermented Wines All Summer LongBy Marissa A.
