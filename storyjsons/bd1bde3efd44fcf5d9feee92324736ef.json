You can buy it by the kilo or prepackaged at boucheries and supermarkets. It\u2019s on menus at both classic bistros and the kind of spots you walk into and think you\u2019ve accidentally touched a Portkey to Los Angeles. The first time I had it was from a train station kiosk during an especially long transfer at the Gare d\u2019Avignon en route to meet friends in Provence. I paired it with a croissant because, balance. It was fine (the croissant was better), but that\u2019s part of the simple beauty of the Extremely French Carrot Salad or \u201ccarottes ra\u0302pe\u0301es\u201d in French: It is at its best\u2014and most cost-effective\u2014when made at home.\u201cCarottes ra\u0302pe\u0301es\u201d translates to the decidedly less chic sounding \u201cgrated carrots,\u201d and that\u2019s mostly what it should be: grated raw carrots, lightly dressed with oil and lemon, a bit of cumin, and little else. If you want to riff, keep it uncomplicated: Use a mess of colored carrots, replace lemon juice with lime, up the cumin, or add in a touch of ground coriander.Making it is simple: In a medium bowl, whisk together 3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, 3 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice, 1 tsp. light honey, and \u00bd tsp. ground cumin. Season with salt. Add 1 lb. carrots, grated on the large holes of a box grater or in a food processor, fitted with a grating attachment, and toss to coat, adjusting the dressing to taste. Stir in \u00bd cup coarsely chopped flat-leaf parsley or cilantro and set aside to marinate for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours before serving.I made this salad many times throughout the process of writing my cookbook \u00c0 Table, and I\u2019ve become especially taken with its ability to pair with pretty much anything else on the table. It\u2019s on the book\u2019s cover alongside Coq au Vermouth (page 111), Salade Verte with Cornichon Vinaigrette (page 210), and, maybe predictably, very good butter, bread, and wine. In fact, I\u2019ve eaten it as a meal alone with very good butter, bread, and wine. I love it paired with the Cider Pork (page 141). I eat forkfuls of it as bright, palate-cleansing breaks while eating the rich, cheese-heavy Croque Madame (page 169) or the equally rich Raclette, or Cheese Dinner with Carbs (page 171). I\u2019ve eaten leftovers for lunch, standing fridge-side as a snack, and I\u2019ve tucked it into Tupperware and brought it to picnic in Parc des Buttes-Chaumont or for ap\u00e9ro on the Canal Saint-Martin.\u00a0And now that I know better, I pack it for every train ride to Provence.\u00c0 Table: Recipes for Cooking and Eating the French Way$30 at Amazon$28 at BookshopRebekah Peppler is a Los Angeles\u2013 and Paris\u2013based writer and food stylist.Adapted from \u2018\u00c0 Table\u2019 by Rebekah Peppler with permission by Chronicle Books, 2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimpleFrenchSaladCarrotRawRecipes you want to make.
