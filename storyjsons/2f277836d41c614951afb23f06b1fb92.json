I would serve it with an herby greek yogurt instead. Probably would make the greens & beans again but this one won't make it into my regular frittata recipe.AnonymousSeattle, WA9/17/2021Great recipe! I have a couple of issues, though. What is a \u201cmedium\u201d skillet? I started with a 10\u201d, then realized everything wasn\u2019t going to fit, so transferred to a 12\u201d and now we have two skillets to clean. Why not be specific? Also, what\u2019s a \u201csmall\u201d bunch of greens? I used a large bunch of chard and it was great. Only thing I might change would be to make garlic yogurt as a dressing, rather than garlic sour cream. Already looking forward to tomorrow\u2019s leftovers!KMcWSeattle, WA9/15/2021Hi there. I love your recipe. I love frittata! Usually I do a quick and simple recipe like here: www.basilbunch.com/spring-onion-frittata-recipe/BasilBunchHamburg, Germany7/22/2020Yummy! This was sooo good.  As soon as I saw the photos and read the reviews, I knew I had to make this asap!  I used one cup of chopped herbs (Italian parsley & cilanto) and it seemed like enough.  Cooked up beautifully.  My best frittata I think ever. The garlic mayo is awesome and I'll be making that going forward for other things. AnonymousPalm Harbor, FL5/14/2020'hakuna frittata!' the best frittata i have made at home, by far. i used kale and parsley, which went very well with the curried chickpeas. depending on the size of pan you use / the size of your oven, the cooking time _may_ vary; but, i'd use a cake tester / toothpick to test the doneness. and best of all, it's very filling and oh so pretty :-) brooklynboyeatsBrooklyn, New York4/14/2020Eh.  Just eh.  This recipe needs a lot of love. If I had to make this again, I\u2019d sub cream cheese for sour cream, add sage and roasted cherry tomatoes. And instead of mayo, I\u2019d spread some crime fraiche with chives on top.  But I\u2019m grateful for you sharing this with me.  I\u2019m just hyper-critical. Philly4/4/2020This recipe is so great, everyone loved it. They garlic mayo is soooo goodAnonymousPortland, Maine3/27/2020Great recipe - unfortunately I overcooked it, but it still tasted good. The garlic mayo is not to be skipped!AnonymousNew York1/28/2020Quick, easy and delicious. I note one review that said it took too long and was fuzzy!! Took me half an hour with ten minutes of cooking time. Great recipe. Thank youjfcaswellCalifornia 1/5/2020This was honestly incredible. I never knew until now that when in doubt, I should frittata - and now I\u2019ve seen the error of my ways. It came together perfectly, lasted several days/lunches, and perfectly filled everyone it was given to (although I didn\u2019t gift much because it was far too good). The method hugely improved the outcome and my frittata skills, and this could easily be adapted for whatever bits are lurking in your fridge and cupboard. Smashing stuff. tallulahvivgraceHampstead, London, UK9/10/2019This was THE BEST use of a dozen eggs. Will absolutely be making again.AnonymousWashington, D.C. 9/8/2019This recipe is PHENOMENAL. We couldn't get enough of it. I added cilantro, basil, and parsley - it seems like a lot of herbs but they soften as they bake - and the flavour was off the charts. The garlic mayo is a must. I'm adding this to my routine on the regular. AnonymousToronto, Canada5/23/2019DELICIOUS!!! I didn't find this frittata difficult to make or take up too many pans at all. Healthy and SO yummy! The flavors are incredible. We omitted the mayo and used Sriracha instead. We'll be eating it all week for breakfast.  AnonymousPismo Beach, CA4/14/2019Hearty variation on a typical frittata -- I kind of wondered about the lack of cheese, but didn't notice its absence at all.  Will definitely make it again.yoshi99Washington, DC1/20/2019This recipe has me rethinking frittatas. Usually I make them and they are over-cooked on the sides and still raw in the middle. But the steps in this recipe are really helpful; having the soft-scramble texture on the stove made it cook more evenly in the oven. The curried chickpeas were really delicious with the egg. Also held up as deliciously leftover the next day.jayneoreWashington, D.C.1/12/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titFrittataEggMustard GreensLeafy GreensVegetableKaleSwiss ChardChickpeaBeanEasyOne-Pot MealsWeeknight MealsMainGluten-FreeVegetarianHealthyishLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
