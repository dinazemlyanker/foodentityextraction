But, lucky for us, there are a couple billion people in the world who\u2019ve gone through their 30s already. We found 19 of them, including some of our favorite chefs, actors, editors, and friends, and asked what they\u2019d do differently if they could turn 30 again.I wish I would have eaten better and tried to be healthier! It\u2019s astounding how poorly I ate considering I cooked at some of the best restaurants in the city. I\u2019d stuff my face with family meal around four before service. Seven or eight hours later, a shift drink of beer would be followed by some sort of greasy burger, hot dog, or cheap (but oh so delicious) bodega sandwich, washed down with a few more beers. \u2014Sohui Kim, chef/owner of The Good Fork and InsaDrink more water! I only recently started really drinking water\u201464 entire ounces on most days\u2014which is standard healthful advice I'd categorically ignored in my 30s. It's made a huge difference on so many levels. My skin is less dry and not as sensitive and itchy in the winter. My nails seem to be splintering a little less. My digestive tract thanks me on a daily basis (or bugs me a little less). My eyes aren't red when I wake up. On days that I neglect the water drinking, I feel it. I don't let myself drink any caffeine in the morning until I slug back 20 ounces of lemony water first. Works like a charm. \u2014Melissa Clark, food columnist for the New York TimesI would care less about what people thought of me. I used to let the fear of people's perceptions inhibit me and hold me back. I wouldn't let that happen now. \u2014Audra McDonald, actor in Frankie & Johnny on Broadway / The Good Fight on CBS All AccessI would have switched from cocktails to red wine earlier. I'm a sucker for a margarita on the rocks with salt, and my go-to drink in my 20s and early 30s was a gin and tonic. But I realized through time, wisdom, and hangovers that I pace myself much better during a dinner party when I nurse a glass of wine. \u2014 Michelle Lee, editor in chief of Allure MagazineI don\u2019t imagine many Healthyish readers want to hear about how I wish I took golf lessons in my 30s. But I guess my feeling is this: Whatever it is that you love to do, that you really want to get better at, do it now. Because if you\u2019re thinking that you\u2019ll have the time when you \u201csettle down,\u201d when you get a spouse and a house and kids and all that, you won\u2019t. Your time is now\u2014take it. \u2014Adam Rapoport, editor in chief of Bon AppetitSpend less time worrying what other people think about you. You will have your good and bad moments, but keep an even keel. \u2014 Michelle Yeoh, actor, Crazy Rich AsiansMy first child was born when I was 31, and my second arrived when I was 37. I'm happy that the baby years are far behind me, but it's crazy that I spent my entire 30s parenting and building my career. There's no evidence that being a mom held me back professionally, but I think my husband and I missed out on some freedom\u2014we would have traveled more, we would have stayed out later, we would have gotten the opportunity to be a little less responsible. \u2014 Carla Lalli Music, food director of Bon AppetitI had a hard time being present with my kids when they were young as it was right when the company was beginning to expand. I would come home and keep thinking about work or read reports. So I wish I would have been more present with my kids. That is one of my biggest lessons: Be present where you are. \u2014 Eileen Fisher, designerBreak up more. Seriously. Dump that boyfriend, get that divorce. You\u2019re not even 40 yet! There\u2019s plenty of time to find new love\u2014why waste your 30s with the bad? \u2014David Tamarkin, digital director of EpicuriousI would have gone back to cooking school for real and become a chef! I took a few classes while I was out of work with the twins, but ended up at Domino. \u2014Stella Bugbee, editor-in-chief of The CutI would\u2019ve slept more and spent more time doing activities that strengthen my body to avoid aches and pains. More yoga, more strength training, more stretching and regular physical therapy. \u2014 Niki Nakayama, chef/owner of n/nakaI would have answered fewer emails and spent more time with my children. It's not too late though\u2014the last year of my 30s will be spent centering what matters most. \u2014Leah Penniman, co-founder and co-director of Soul Fire Farm.Looking back, I wish I would have carved out a little more personal time. Opening my first restaurant in my mid-30s was both exciting and stressful and I poured everything into it. I think it's important to take some carved out, dedicated time each week to step back, refuel and recharge. \u2014 Nina Compton, Chef/Co-owner of Compere Lapin and Bywater American Bistro in New OrleansI wish I had traveled more. Travel is the key to understanding everything, especially home. As a chef that translates home-cooking techniques to restaurant cooking, my travels inform everything I do. \u2014Alex Raij, chef/owner at Txikito, El Quinto Pino, La Vara, and Saint Julivert FisherieI would have valued my female friendships as much as my romantic ones: All of those women are still an essential part of my life. The men? Not a one. \u2014Christine Muhlke, Bon Appetit editor-at-large and founder of Bureau XI would have proactively taken better care of my body. Cooking is extremely physical and very hard on your body as the years go on. I found pilates in my 40s and it has helped significantly, but I can only imagine how much better I would feel today if I had been doing it all along. \u2014Missy Robbins, chef/owner at Misi and LiliaI would have had five kids! I have one\u2014he is my inspiration and motivation and heart wrapped in one. Having more would have been so fun (and kept me even more so on my toes)! \u2014Gabriela C\u00e1mara, chef/owner of Contramar and CalaWhat I would definitely do differently would be to commit to my love of dance, drag, kink, fashion, and art just as much as I committed to my work. I would find a better balance between my duty and the dance floor. \u2014Ora Wise, activist, organizer, and cookIn my 30s (and 40s and a little less in my 50s) I was very driven and life was all about work, work, work. I\u2019d have taken more time for mental health, and put more time and effort into creating and supporting friendships. \u2014 Liz Prueitt, co-founder of Tartine BakeryExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishGuide to Your 30sRead MoreLifestyleLauren Underwood Is Doing Her 30s Better Than Just About Anyone We KnowBy Hilary CadiganRecipes you want to make.
