Look at all the peaches! And blueberries! And tomatoes! You buy it all! And then, a few days later, you\u2019ve eaten only a quarter of your stash and the rest is starting to brown. I\u2019ve been there.So have many members of the BA staff. But there\u2019s plenty you can do to salvage those bright flavors. Here are some of our favorite ways to get the most out of fruit that\u2019s juuust passing its prime.Healthyish assistant editor Aliza Abarbanel takes inspiration from this Instagram post from cookbook author Amy Chaplin and blitzes her bruised peaches into a peach-chia breakfast shake. It\u2019s as easy as tossing almond milk, peaches, and vanilla into a blender, topping with chia seeds, and chilling overnight. The ideal breakfast.For editorial assistant Jesse Sparks, a lightly macerated fruit salad tossed with salt, sugar, black Urfa chile pepper, and cinnamon makes lackluster fruit taste \u201cdelightfully bright and complex.\u201d \u201cTo go one step further,\u201d he adds, \u201cyou can even split your cut fruit measurements in half and only macerate one half of the bunch. This way some chunks are riper and softer, while the other half feels a bit more crisp and fresh against the macerated portion. It\u2019s a bit of a psychology trick to make even bad fruit taste great.\u201d Brilliant.\u201cThis is boring,\u201d writes Basically editor Sarah Jampel, \u201cbut I most often make shrub!\u201d Frankly there\u2019s nothing boring about a shrub, a tangy and refreshing concentrate of fruit, vinegar, and sugar that can be drunk by itself or in cocktails. Jampel loves Al Culliton\u2019s easy method, which simply requires letting all the ingredients hang out for a few hours in a tightly sealed jar.The solution to bruised fruit is always compote for associate editor Christina Chaey. Here\u2019s her method: \u201cSimmer chunks of bruised fruit with water or fruit juice (like fresh orange juice), sweetener like sugar/honey/maple syrup, a spice or two if you want (cinnamon, cardamom, star anise) until it completely breaks down and becomes jammy.\u201d Use it to top yogurt, spread on toast, or blend with a smoothie.\u201cI usually just bake it, since it would get broken down and squishy anyways,\u201d says digital restaurant editor Elyse Inamine. One of her favorite bakes is these blueberry hand pies by food stylist Sue Li. \u201cThe crust-to-fruit ratio is perfect,\u201d she says, and they are also the perfect portable treat for a picnic.Bruised tomatoes are no big deal for senior staff writer Alex Beggs\u2014she just turns them into this grated tomato sauce, courtesy of the chef Ashley Christensen. The grating method is ingenious\u2014it eliminates the mess that often comes with slicing tomatoes and skins them too, leaving you with uniformly shredded bits. No one will ever know you started with a bruised tomato.BA.com editor Sasha Levine macerates her bruised berries and eats them with whipped cream for dessert (or breakfast). The salt and sugar amplify the flavor of even the most bruised fruit, and when you\u2019re macerating, \u201ceverything gets a little soft and mushy,\u201d she says, \u201cso who\u2019s to know they started out a little less than perfect?\u201dAnd finally, associate editor Hilary Cadigan keeps it super simple. \u201cI just make smoothies. So many smoothies.\u201d Cadigan pro tip: Add kale powder and tell yourself you are very healthy!Explore Bon App\u00e9titFruitRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
