It\u2019s a peppery condiment that\u2014to put it mildly\u2014we have quite the liking for. If you were to peek into the fridges of any of our staff members, you\u2019d find a jar or two hanging out on the door. But what is harissa, this condiment we use with such frequency and gratitude? Great question.Harissa originally hails from Tunisia and has become a cornerstone of many Tunisian, Israeli, Moroccan, Libyan, and Algerian dishes. It\u2019s a chile paste made from a variety of dried chile peppers (ranging from very hot to mild) that are rehydrated then blended with olive oil, spices (usually toasted for a more intense flavor), and, sometimes, garlic. Harissa varies widely: Sometimes it's smoky from the addition of roasted fresh chiles; sometimes it's sharp and tangy from citrus juice and/or vinegar; sometimes it's loose saucy; other times it's thick and pasty.Photo by Chelsie CraigWhile you can certainly make harissa at home, it\u2019s also widely available at grocery stores. But before you grab a jar off of the shelf, there are a couple things to keep in mind. First, many brands that make harissa have hot and mild varieties. You obviously already know what these distinctions mean: If you want more spice, go for the hot. If you want sweeter, more floral pepper flavor with minimal heat, go for the mild.But within each brand, the hot and mild versions will have different levels of spice. There isn\u2019t an industry-wide unit of measurement for how spicy harissa is. The best way to control for spiciness is to find a brand you like and use it exclusively (within reason, of course). If you find yourself face to face with an unfamiliar brand, taste it before you add it so that you don't end up with a dish that's inedibly hot (or more mild-mannered than you'd prefer).Second, look for brands that list peppers as the first ingredient. Harissa can sometimes be cut with tomato product, and that's not what you want. (When in doubt, we go with the brand NY Shuk.)Harissa loves chicken. Chicken loves harissa. Perfect.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesOkay so now you have harissa. What the hell do you do with it? Short answer: Use it in any way you\u2019d use chile paste, fresh chiles, or hot sauce.Longer and more useful answer: Stir it into scrambled eggs. Add it to marinades. Stir it into sauces. Mix it into yogurt for a spicy, peppery dip. Toss roasted and grilled vegetables in harissa or plop a spoonful on top of your hummus. Stir it into softened butter and slather it on boiled corn. Spread it on sandwiches. Sub it for ketchup!The applications are as limitless as our love for that beautiful, peppery flavor.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHarissaCondiment/SpreadPepperIngredientsRecipes you want to make.
