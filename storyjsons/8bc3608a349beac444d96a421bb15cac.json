As she dips what she dubs a \u201cwoven golden basket\u201d of ginger-mint tea into a mug of steaming water, the actress admits: \u201cI\u2019m not a loose-leaf tea gal; it\u2019s too much work for me.\u201d We both inhale a whiff, and it\u2019s as close to a spa as you can get in the middle of an NYC restaurant.A warming mug is exactly what we needed during this drizzly spring day. \u201cI\u2019m always cold and I\u2019m a hyped-up kind of girl, so I need some calming teas,\" Lister-Jones says. \u201cI like when my basil\u2019s holy, and I\u2018m big on chamomile, lavender, fresh mint, and fennel for digestion.\u201d Even though tea is a soothing ritual for her, she admits that the storage situation is anything but calm. \u201cI have a drawer full of boxes of tea. It\u2019s chaos,\u201d she says with an open-mouthed laugh.Lister-Jones, 35, has a hyphenated name and a multi-hyphenate career. She plays dry-witted lawyer Jen Short in Life in Pieces, an acclaimed family comedy that returns for season four this fall; she wrote the rom-com-ish  Lola Versus about figuring out your life before you turn 30 (starring Oscar-winning friend Greta Gerwig); and she wrote, produced, directed, and starred in the film Band Aid, a dramedy in which a couple turns their blowout fights into writing and performing music instead. Oh, and she wrote and performed the original music for it too. And made a pizza holder out of a harmonica stand. As Lister-Jones describes it, she can\u2019t figure out how to stop creating new ideas nonstop, like a roadrunner sprinting laps around her brain.\"Working with women is so quiet and hyper-efficient. It was a very cohesive, communicative, patient, and kind set. It\u2019s unquantifiable to explain\u2014it just felt different.\"\u201cAs a creator, it\u2018s really hard to turn my mind off. I have a problem with distinguishing productivity from pleasure. I feel most at peace when I\u2018m being productive, but I think that\u2018s a lie that I tell myself. When I allow myself to power down, I have so much more energy to create and more ideas than when I grind through it every day.\u201dIt was this level of intensity about her work that led her to hire an entirely female crew for Band Aid, from cinematographers and editors to truck drivers. Initially she wanted a safe space for her directorial debut so her authority wasn\u2019t questioned, giving herself the best shot at being a leader, but it did much more than that. \u201cWorking with women is so quiet and hyper-efficient. It was a very cohesive, communicative, patient, and kind set. It\u2019s unquantifiable to explain\u2014it just felt different. And I hope it sets a standard for the future, whether I can just hire more women or up to 100 percent again.\u201dNow that #MeToo, Time\u2019s Up, and 50/50 by 2020 are household names, Lister-Jones is cautiously optimistic that there can be real changes in the industry. \u201cI never would have imagined we would have gotten this far in this short amount of time. There is a definite shift in terms of discourse around gender and racial inequity, but the system is so broken that it\u2018s going to take so much more than any of us can understand,\u201d she explains between sips of tea. \u201cThere are more and more stories being told about women, but in terms of the objectification of women, it\u2018s so ingrained in our society.\u201dLister-Jones\u2019 partner in work and in life is her husband, Daryl Wein, with whom she has co-written multiple films. She admits she hasn\u2019t experienced a lot of the double standards that other women have when pitching new projects and on set. However, as she does more projects on her own, she\u2019s feeling a need to work harder and prove herself.\u201cListen, I love the idea of directing a superhero movie. That is a part of my aspirational manifestation,\u201d she says. But with those aspirations comes stress. To combat anxiety, she turns to her routines, like her daily end-of-night process: removing her makeup, taking a steam shower with essential oils, and doing a mask. \u201cSo much of my job is about human interaction. By the time I come home, I may have spoken to a hundred people,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2018s something really nice about the solitude of those moments of stripping away that character and that day. Or multiple days of things not being quite right. It\u2019s a reset.\u201dOther times, she turns to her kitchen, not so much for cooking as supplementing. \u201cMy pantry has pull out shelves, and I have a very large shelf completely covered with supplements,\u201d she tells me with her arms outstretched to show its size. \u201cMy cleaning lady said to me the other day, \u2018Are you sick?\u2019 But I\u2018m actually quite healthy. I was proud of my vitamin drawer for this flu season, because as everyone around me dropped like flies, I didn\u2019t get sick. If my drawer had a name, it\u2019d be Beyonc\u00e9\u2014she\u2019s superhuman.\u201d The assortment includes get-well remedies like colloidal silver, oregano oil, and Lypo-Spheric Vitamin C (a \u201cgnarly gel that\u2019s like eating Neosporin\u201d); Vitamin D, B-complex, and probiotics; and Chinese herbs and powders recommended by her acupuncturist and holistic MD. (Two go-tos are Herbal ABX and Nourish by Evergreen Herbs.) She regularly does cupping to get rid of toxins, even though it \u201cmakes you look like you were abducted by aliens.\u201dWhen it comes to her diet, she calls herself a \u201cbone brothatarian,\u201d which means plant-based plus bone broth for protein and other vitamins. She also eats \u201ca fuck ton of greens.\u201d She rolls her eyes at herself as she says that, joking that it\u2019s the \u201cmost LA thing\u201d she\u2019s ever said. \u201cThis is crazy, but I try to eat six to nine servings of greens a day. A serving, to me, is a fistful or so, and I get most of the vitamins and iron I need there. I was raised on big salads and homemade dressings, so I\u2019ve always loved them.\u201d (She estimates that her Dimes\u2019 order\u2014a salad with lacinato kale, red cabbage, candy cane beets, carrots, and sorrel\u2014classifies as at least three servings of greens.)\"My husband showed me a video of this robot that plants and waters for you and I'm like, 'I'm in, add to cart.'\"Living in Los Angeles now, \u201cyou can throw a rock and hit a farmers\u2018 market,\u201d but Lister-Jones has always had a healthy relationship with fresh produce. \u201cMy mom was really health conscious-growing up, so I was raised with a lot of awareness around where my food was sourced, going to farmers\u2019 markets and the Park Slope Food Co-Op.\u201d Her mom graduated to growing veg on her Brooklyn rooftop, but Lister-Jones... isn\u2018t quite there yet. She jokes that she has \u201ca black thumb and kills all living plants by just looking at them.\u201d\u201cMy husband tried to do a garden in our backyard, and it was so exciting, but everything died,\u201d she says with a sigh. \u201cWhen we had it, he showed me a video of this robot that plants and waters for you and I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m in, add to cart. Amazon Prime.\u2019\u201dAs much as Lister-Jones appreciates her routines, she\u2019s also game for experimentation, whether with gardening robots, new supplements, or different foods to add to her diet. \u201cIt\u2019s an ever-evolving journey to see what\u2018s good for my body and my health. I have to be careful because I\u2019m really good at eating so clean sometimes that it eliminates everything.\u201dBut like with any life decisions, there is one big nonnegotiable. \u201cI put on salt on everything. I need a lot of salt in my life. It\u2019s one of my joys. No one will ever take it away from me.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titInterviewsCelebritiesHealthyishRead Moreculture'Battle of the Sexes' Star Natalie Morales Is Queer, Vegetarian, Cuban, and ProudBy Alyse WhitneycultureEliza Coupe: \"I\u2019m an Actress with Food Issues and Body Image Issues\u2014That's Real\"By Alyse WhitneyLifestyleThe Healthyish Guide to Feeling Better AlreadyGallery13 SlidesBy The Healthyish TeamLifestyleThe 7 Supplements That Healthyish Staffers Swear ByGallery7 SlidesBy The Healthyish TeamRecipes you want to make.
