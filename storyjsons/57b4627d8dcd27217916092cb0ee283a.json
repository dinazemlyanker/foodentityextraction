Treat them to these next-level presents they\u2019ll fully appreciate but probably never buy for themselves.Brush Up Those ChopsAny home cook worth his or her hand-harvested sea salt knows how to, well, cook. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean she can pull off a make-ahead, multicourse dinner party. Instead of signing her up for a class at a local cooking school, give her online courses she can take whenever she wants from the comfort of her own kitchen.D\u00e9cor for ThoughtWhile foodies are usually happy to shell out for good ingredients, they may not always spring for flowers. Brighten up a friend\u2019s dining room table or desk with a customizable monthly or bimonthly floral subscription. Or go all out with a one-time delivery of a big-impact flower arrangement.An Upgraded Coffee ExperienceA fine bottle of wine is a nice present, but it\u2019ll be gone in an evening. Give the gift of exceptional coffee every single morning with a Nespresso VertuoPlus. It can brew five different single-serve cup sizes\u2014from a shot of espresso to a 14-ounce Alto, all with silky smooth crema\u2014at the touch of a button. Plus, the Nespresso capsules are fully recyclable, so the recipient and Mother Earth will thank you.And why stop there? Extend your coffee experience with the Nespresso Vertuo travel mug, made from double-walled stainless steel, for taking your coffee to go.Skin TherapyPeople who cook a lot also tend to do a lot of dishes, which can dry out their skin. While dishwashing gloves can help with that, they don\u2019t make a great stocking stuffer. What does: a luxurious hand moisturizer. Look for ingredients such as coconut oil or shea butter for extra hydration and a rich feel.Stylish FunctionFor a gift that is equal parts beauty and performance, upgrade a loved one\u2019s stovetop with a stunning copper saut\u00e9 pan made to heat up rapidly and cool down quickly. A perfect excuse to make dinner plans for two. Seared halloumi, anyone?Sweet TreatsKnow someone with a sweet tooth? Skip the time it takes to make them a tasty treat and buy direct from one of the nation\u2019s best bakeries, many of which now ship their from-scratch, fresh-baked cookies, pies, and cupcakes nationwide. Another option: Pints of artisanal ice cream packed in dry ice so they\u2019re guaranteed to arrive frozen.Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
