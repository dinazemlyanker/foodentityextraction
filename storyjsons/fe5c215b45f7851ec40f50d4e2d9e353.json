Along the way: food you won\u2019t forget.By Rocky MountaineerJanuary 24, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailPristine mountain views and winter sports might be some of the first things you think of when it comes to the Canadian Rockies. But with natural resources this immaculate, the food scene is thriving as well. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for.From fine-dining establishments that serve the best dry-aged Alberta beef to cozy cafes with vegan sandwiches, Rocky Mountains restaurants are marrying spectacular experiences, breathtaking views, and farm-fresh foods that make for an unforgettable trip. Dotted throughout the mountains, you\u2019ll find award-winning chefs from around the world cultivating inventive and inviting menus dedicated to translating the flavor of the landscape onto their plates.Photo by Rocky Mountaineer | Town of Jasper, AlbertaA little over 200 miles from Edmonton sits the quaint town of Jasper, the commercial center of Jasper National Park, which was established in the early 1800s as a supply depot for the fur trade, then revitalized in 1911 by the Grand Trunk Railway. Today the mountain village has a small-town vibe, thanks to its intimate community of outdoor enthusiasts. And if you\u2019ve ever spent time in a cozy mountain town, you\u2019ll know that none are complete without a craft brewery.Maybe it\u2019s the crisp air coupled with pristine views that make towns like Jasper the prime location for such a place, or simply that visitors need somewhere to relax after a day of exploring one of the area\u2019s many falls or canyons. Either way, Jasper Brewing Company knew its calling. Three Jasper locals opened the bustling, community-minded brewpub back in 2005\u2013\u2013and it\u2019s as local as it gets. \u201cOur beer uses barley and wheat primarily sourced from Alberta, and of course, our water flows right out of the surrounding Rocky Mountains,\u201d says brewmaster Spike Baker.Photo by Jasper Brewing Company | Rockhopper IPA & Bearhill RamenAs if being the first brewery in a Canadian national park wasn\u2019t enough to set them apart, the owners are revolutionizing pub-fare menus while they\u2019re at it. \u201cOur upmarket-pub, scratch-made menu and in-house brewed beer make us one of a kind,\u201d he adds. With dishes like duck tacos and wild boar steamed buns, it\u2019s easy to see these aren\u2019t your standard pub offerings. If it\u2019s your first time, Spike insists you try the rustic elk meatloaf, and wash it down with a Blackeye Blueberry Vanilla Ale.If you prefer spirits over lagers, Park Distillery in neighboring Banff\u2013\u2013the only distillery in a Canadian national park\u2013\u2013is going local with their award-winning, small-batch, house-made libations. The landscape has made its way into the spirits: the Park Alpine Dry Gin, made with native spruce, evokes the scent of the surrounding forest, while the grain in the base spirit is sourced from family farms in the Alberta foothills. The Park Espresso Vodka is flavored with beans from the nearby Banff Roasting Company.Photo by Anna Robi | Park spirits on ice and campfire cuisine at Park Distillery in Banff, AlbertaThough Banff, just under 200 miles from Jasper, experienced its modern renaissance in the late 1800s when the new cross-Canadian railway was routed through the area, the region has been used as a hunting ground for more than 10,000 years. Park Distillery executive chef Mark Calcafuoco is embracing that history with the help of a wood-fired grill they refer to as the \u201cindoor campfire.\u201dChef Calcafuoco recommends the rotisserie chicken, which is \u201cslowly cooked over the fire for three or so hours...a truly amazing smoke-kissed dish.\u201d And if you\u2019re still craving that wood-fired flavor, the Observation Peak cocktail, which features Park Glacier Rye, is capped with a torched, smoky cedar square\u2013\u2013a fitting nightcap in the middle of the woods.It\u2019s clear that many of the restaurants in the Canadian Rockies feel compelled to produce cuisine that reflects the local bounty. And nature has answered. At Tekarra Restaurant, a Jasper staple since 1952, chef Dale Nutt artfully prepares dishes crafted from elk, bison, wild boar, and rainbow trout in a cozy atmosphere that\u2019s surrounded by pine trees and is oh-so serene. Unique dishes, such as bison short ribs braised in Saskatoon berries and molasses, punctuate a menu of hearty, gamey iterations of Canadian mainstays like poutine. Chef Nutt also makes his own classic sauces and jams, bourbon mustard, and smoked trout.Photo by Celina Frisson | Alberta tenderloin beef skewers at Tekarra Restaurant in Jasper, AlbertaBack in Banff, Chuck\u2019s Steakhouse starts cultivating an exceptional steakhouse experience at the farm. Its locally sourced beef comes from three family ranches, all within 205 miles of the restaurant, where the animals are grass-fed and raised in a kind, sustainable environment. When it comes to preparing each cut, the in-house dry-aging program is unique as well, as it is the only place in Banff that dry-ages Alberta beef with such care. \u201cThe longer the beef ages, the more intense the flavor and tenderness,\u201d says chef Sal Polizzi. He adds, \u201cChuck's will generally dry-age its beef for 45 days, but have aged some cuts as long as 95 days.\u201dPhoto by Anna Robi | Chef Salvatore Polizzi of Chuck\u2019s Steakhouse with in-house, dry-aged Alberta beef cuts.Go for the steak and marvel at the experience. The scenery at Chuck\u2019s is nothing to scoff at\u2013\u2013it has stunning mountain views\u2013\u2013but if you want to feel as though you\u2019re on top of the world, take the gondola to 7,510 feet above sea level to dine on fresh, Canadian fare at Sky Bistro. From Banff\u2019s Sulphur Mountain, you\u2019ll be surrounded by the Rockies, and savor food that reflects just that.Tucked inside Banff National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Fairmont Banff Springs goes by the nickname the \u201cCastle in the Rockies,\u201d and has been a legendary getaway for more than 125 years. Here, executive chef Robert Ash matches the culinary standards of his restaurants to the awe-inspiring scenery that surrounds the resort. \u201cEverything we do sets us apart,\u201d says chef Ash. \u201cOur in-house butchery program allows us to use every part of the animals,\u201d he says. \u201cWe make our own sausages, cure our own meats, and grind all of our own meats for burgers, meatballs, and more. The fat is rendered and used for baking, mashed potatoes, and confit.\u201dPhoto by The Vermillion Room at Fairmont Banff Springs | Steak FritesIf this weren\u2019t enough to convince you of their dedication to sustainability, he continues, \u201cWe make our own hot sauces and barrel-age them in used bourbon barrels from local producers. With vegetable and fruit scraps, we infuse and make our own vinegars used for salad dressings. Our bakery makes all the breads used on the property and leftover breads are used for bread crumbs, croutons, and bread puddings.\u201dThen there\u2019s the finished product. In the recently refurbished Vermillion Room, chef recommends the bouillabaisse. In Rundle Lounge, he favors the house-made chorizo-stuffed dates wrapped in bacon, and at Castello Ristorante, he urges you to try the fresh pasta dishes. No matter which of the hotel restaurants you choose to dine at, know that every ingredient has been thoughtfully procured. And with 11 establishments to choose from, you could sample cuisines from across the globe without ever leaving the premises.

The real attraction, though\u2013\u2013besides thrilling mountain views\u2013\u2013is the Swiss fondue. Available in three versions: traditional, black truffle, or with roasted garlic and foraged morel mushrooms, this decadent experience is best enjoyed with an Alpine beer or a bottle from their extensive floor-to-ceiling wine library.While it seems the area is packed with fine-dining establishments, there is also a variety of low-key spots with equally high standards. Arrive hungry for breakfast at Tooloulou\u2019s, because this local favorite is serious about its Louisiana roots, as evidenced by their expansive portion sizes of pancakes, waffles, French toast, grits, breakfast po\u2019boys, or Cajun-style omelettes. For lunch, expect Creole menu standards like jambalaya, \u00e9touff\u00e9e, gumbo, frog legs, alligator, and crawfish. Also, arrive early.
