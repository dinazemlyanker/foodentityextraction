Randy Clement of Silverlake Wines runs the beverage program (and co-owns the space with Molina), so let the staff guide you to kind of wine you\u2019re in the mood for.THE VIBE IS: your very stylish friend\u2019s backyard party. Sure, you can\u2019t go wrong sitting at the sleek bar or cozied up at one of the black leather booths inside, but you\u2019re in always-sunny L.A. and that\u2019s enough reason to hang out in the back with all the other Arts District locals and chefs off the clock.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day: Monday to Thursday and Saturday, 5 p.m. to 2 a.m.; Friday, 4 p.m. to 2 a.m., and Sunday, 2 p.m. to midnight. It\u2019s not super necessary, but you can reserve ahead.\u2014Elyse InamineRen FullerWE ALSO LOVERustic CanyonWhere seasonal veg meets serious meat in Santa MonicaThe Walker InnFor when you want something quiet, cool, and intimate in KoreatownWinsomeL.A. plays itself at this whimsical Echo Park caf\u00e9Explore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
