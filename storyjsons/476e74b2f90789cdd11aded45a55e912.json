If you sign up for our newsletter, you\u2019ll get her letter before everyone else.It\u2019s Navratri this week, a Hindu festival celebrating the changing season and, like all my favorite Hindu holidays, a triumph of good over evil (in this case, a restoration of dharma). Most years I keep at least a portion of the nine-day Navratri fast, but with new job busyness and all this staying at home, I missed the familiar signs of festival season\u2014bouquets of bright marigolds popping up in bodegas, friends making garba plans, displays of fast-friendly ingredients like sabudana in Indian stores\u2014and just did not get it together in time to prepare.I had pretty much decided to skip the fast altogether this year, but then I read a couple of really lovely stories about how some people found solace and community during this spring\u2019s Ramadan\u2014a different fasting holiday\u2014and wondered if I was giving up too easily. And then a friend came by with fresh curry leaves from her new plant (a luxury here in Brooklyn!) and I took it as a sign to shape up and get my Navratri fasting plan\u2014which is actually all about cooking, since the fast is more of a restrictive diet\u2014in order. The list of forbidden foods is predictably long (table salt, garlic, onions, warming spices like garam masala and turmeric, lentils, staple rices and flours, eggs, meat, alcohol, coffee, and so on), but there\u2019s also a whole range of special, delightful meals that are eaten during Navratri, using the \u201capproved\u201d ingredients, which are easy to find in every corner market and utilized across restaurant menus\u2014if you\u2019re in India.Want this letter before it hits the website?\u00a0Sign up for our newsletter!Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesHere in New York, for someone like me who is behind on, well, everything, it\u2019s all about sweet potatoes, coupled with the permissible dairy, fruits, nuts, and sweeteners like honey and sugar. As my grandmothers are quick to remind me, the sweet potatoes we get most easily here in the U.S. are miles away from the white-fleshed ones in India, but they\u2019re still allowed, and they\u2019re cheap, versatile, delicious, and accessible to me without hopping on a train or two to get to an Indian grocery store. For the rest of the week, you can find me charring them to eat with hot honey butter and lime or roasting them to top with hazelnuts and yogurt. With the curry leaves, plus some ghee and cumin, I\u2019ll make a tadka to drizzle over them, and I might play around with chaat preparations with whatever else I have on hand. I\u2019ll drink nimbu pani all week, and once I get sick of savoryish sweet potatoes, I\u2019m also going to try these sweetly caramelized plantains called maduritos.Whether you\u2019re fasting for Navratri or not, I\u2019d love to hear what you\u2019re cooking this week, and if you have any favorite quick ways to punch up tubers.
