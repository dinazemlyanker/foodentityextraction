In Puerto Rico, Mexico, and the Philippines, adobo is essential and multipurpose. But what is adobo, exactly? The answer depends on where you are and who you\u2019re talking to.Derived from the Spanish word adobar, or \u201cto marinate,\u201d adobo unites the many places that once fell under the Spanish Empire. But adobo is also an example of how separate cultures persisted and evolved despite the Spanish influence. The word adobo speaks to a shared history of Spanish occupation, but taste adobo from Mexico beside adobo from the Philippines and you\u2019ll instantly witness how traditions diverged.What is Spanish adobo?We can start with Spain, where adobar, the verb, becomes adobo, the noun, meaning dressing or marinade. (Etymology suggests the word has even older roots: The Spanish adobar came from the Old French adober, which referred to dressing a knight in armor but came to apply to food as well.)These vinegar-and-olive oil marinades are usually flavored with piment\u00f3n, oregano, salt, garlic, and black pepper. They came about in the centuries before refrigeration, as they helped preserve proteins\u2014a particularly useful practice in humid coastal areas where meat spoiled quickly. The port city of C\u00e1diz, for example, is known for cazon en adobo, in which dense chunks of dogfish get a long marinade in vinegar and spices.What is Mexican adobo?After conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s led the expedition that overthrew the Aztec Empire in 1521, Spain controlled Mexico for 300 years. As the Spanish Empire took over the world, it imposed Spanish culture upon its new colonies. In Mexico, the Old World technique of adobo met New World ingredients, namely the chile peppers native to Central and South America.In Mexico, adobo sauce starts with dried chiles like guajillo and ancho peppers. The chiles are rehydrated and combined into a thick paste with an acid like vinegar or citrus juice and flavorful additions like onions, garlic, cumin, and oregano. Mexican adobo, like Spanish adobo, is often used as a marinade for meat and seafood. A protein marinated in adobo is referred to as adobada\u2014you\u2019ve likely seen the pork version on the menu at taco shops. Adobo can be thinned out with broth to make a sauce, turned into the base of a stew, or used as a condiment.Mexican adobo can also be found in the form of canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce from brands like La Coste\u00f1a. The peppers and sauce add instant smoky flavor and heat to anything you add them to without the whole process of making adobo from scratch.What is Puerto Rican adobo?The colonization of Puerto Rico began in the early 1500s, bringing many of the same Spanish influences to the island. As is the case in Mexico, adobo in Puerto Rico most traditionally refers to a wet marinade consisting of garlic, some kind of acid (vinegar or citrus), oregano, salt, pepper, and olive oil.The ratio of ingredients depends on what meat is in play, says Von Diaz, a journalist, professor, and author of the cookbook Coconuts & Collards. A dense protein destined for slow-cooking, like pork shoulder, can handle an adobo with more garlic and stronger acid like vinegar or naranja agria (bitter orange), Diaz explains, whereas a delicate fish requires a sauce with less garlic, less salt, and citrus instead of vinegar.Not only does adobo preserve, but it also helps infuse flavor into the tougher cuts of meat once common on the historically under-resourced island. Just as some cooks might think of salt and pepper as nonnegotiables, \u201cI would argue that for most Puerto Ricans, we would never prepare any kind of protein without applying some kind of adobo,\u201d she says.There\u2019s another kind of adobo for which many people in the Puerto Rican diaspora have affection: the dry seasoning that comes in a plastic shaker, launched by Goya in 1966. This blend of salt, granulated garlic, oregano, black pepper, and turmeric can be added to anything, from sauces and stews to popcorn. \u201cIt's just a super tasty flavor punch,\u201d says Diaz, who didn\u2019t grow up with it herself since her family prefers to season without premade blends. But, she points out, the components of the wet spice paste and the dry stuff are similar\u2014basically, different ways to get to a similar goal.Goya now sells multiple adobo blends, including one with saffron and another with cumin, and the options for this kind of adobo have grown as smaller producers like Loisa and Seattle chef Eric Rivera sling shakers of their own. You can even make it yourself.Photo by Isa ZapataLoisa\u2019s Saz\u00f3n and Adobo$19 at Loisa (Combo-Pack)$11 at Amazon (Adobo)$11 at Amazon (Saz\u00f3n)What is Filipino adobo?In the Philippines, which was claimed by the Spanish in 1521, adobo is most often a braise featuring vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, bay leaves, and black peppercorns\u2014the ratio of which is dictated by both your family\u2019s palate and your own. While I might like my chicken adobo saucy and more savory than sour, my cousin might want theirs slightly sweet and reduced into a sticky glaze; another cousin might go for pork, not chicken, because anything can become adobo, even squid, eggplant, or mushrooms.Considered by many to be the national dish of the Philippines, adobo reflects the regionality of the archipelago\u2019s 7,640 islands. In some regions, coconut milk is added for adobo sa gata, and not all adobos even contain soy sauce. It might be replaced with fish sauce and annatto to make adobong pula (red adobo), with turmeric to make adobong dilaw (yellow adobo), or skipped entirely for adobong puti (white adobo).Given the way colonialism goes, the long-standing story has been that Filipino adobo came from the Spanish and Mexican dishes. But food historian Raymond Sokolov has posed another hypothesis: Because the ingredients for adobo, like the country\u2019s many vinegars, were already present in the Philippines by the time Magellan showed up in the 16th century, Sokolov argues that what the Spanish, after seeing similarities to their own marinade in the native braise, contributed the name. White adobo, in fact, was identified as an Indigenous practice in 1613 by the Franciscan missionary Pedro de San Buenaventura, who called it \u201cadobo de los naturales.\u201d While history may be disputed, one thing is for certain: Everyone loves adobo.If you can dream it, you can adobo it:Adobo Mushroom TacosMeaty mushrooms get spiced to perfection and roasted until crisp before they're tucked into warm corn tortillas.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingShoppingRecipes you want to make.
