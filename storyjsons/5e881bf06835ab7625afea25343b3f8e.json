Slice the daikon and carrots as thinly as possible so there\u2019s tons of surface area to absorb the coconut garlic glaze. The subtle sweetness in that glaze comes from coconut aminos, made from the fermented sap of coconut palm trees. Coconut aminos offer some of the same flavor notes as soy sauce but with less sodium and no soy or gluten. Look for coconut aminos (Bragg is a common brand) in health food stores, Whole Foods, or online.

Let cool.Salmon and assemblyStep 2Toast almonds in a dry small skillet over medium heat, tossing occasionally, until slightly darkened and fragrant, 5\u20138 minutes. Let cool, then coarsely chop.Step 3Meanwhile, pour 2 Tbsp. oil into a cold large nonstick skillet. Season salmon with salt and pepper and place, skin side down, in oil. Set over medium heat and cook, pressing fillets gently with a spatula so skin makes good contact with the pan, until skin is browned and crisp, 5\u20137 minutes. Press down in the center of fillets if they begin to lift from pan. Turn fillets over and cook on flesh side until just cooked through, about 1 minute.Step 4Combine daikon, carrots, almonds, half of the glaze, and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in a medium bowl and toss to coat. Add a pinch of salt and toss again.Step 5Serve salmon and pickled daikon and carrots with remaining glaze alongside.How would you rate Skillet Salmon\u00a0With Pickle-y Salad?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (11)Back to TopTriangleI love salmon, I love root vegetables, so I was really looking forward to this recipe.   The glaze was quite lackluster, not at all pickley and overly fishy.  I am not sure how this would be a pickled salad without the vinegar... It seems like there should have been an acid instead of the sauce.   Cooked according the directions the first was also quite dry.   This is definitely the worst executed recipe I had yet to try in BA history (although not the worst to come in this FGFP).  The dinner concluded with the ordering of pizza.Anonymous2/15/2021I spent time finding coconut aminos. I spent  time slicing carrots and daikon thinly on the diagonal. I regret every minute and every penny I spent making this recipe. It sounded some promising yet the sauce was so awfulAnonymousPleasant Hill CA2/4/2021This was a deeply disappointing recipe and I would not make it again. I don't understand what the glaze was supposed to be, but it was just bad\u2014terribly, almost inedibly salty, with no acidity from the vinegar coming through at all. While the glaze was cooking, it was nose-searingly pungent as well. I also don't understand how adding the glaze to carrots and daikon could make them \"pickle-y\"; if you want quick-pickled daikon and carrots, just toss them in rice vinegar, a sprinkle of sugar, and a pinch of salt for 10+ minutes. Searing the salmon skin starting from a cold pan worked reasonably well, but then I had to cook the fillet for 10 minutes or so on the other side, not the 1 minute the recipe proposes, in order to not eat raw fish for dinner, which made the skin a little soggy. (Minor additional gripe: Why show the carrots and daikon julienned in the picture if the recipe says to \"slice thinly on the diagonal\"? Readers > Instagram.) Bad recipe, steer clear.SonaliNew Haven, CT1/14/2021Enjoyed this dish very much. Fish sauce smell was strong while making the glaze, but it did not overpower the sauce and the end product was well balanced. Fish was cooked perfectly and this was the first time I enjoyed eating salmon skin. Not sure why the salad was described as pickle-y, but it sure was tasty.CookFitFoodDallas, TX1/10/2021This recipe was AMAZING!!! Super easy, light, and delicious.claudiaeleniDenver, CO1/8/2021The salad was nice. I was unable to get daikon so subbed regular radishes. I also added a few handfuls of spinach leaves. Worked great. Terri Victoria, BC Canada 1/8/2021WOW! This is so freaking good man, definitely my favorite recipe so far. I didn't make any changes and it came out perfect. Loved the crispy salmon skin, it was probably my favorite part, that and the glaze, it was heavenly :-)Laura EChula Vista, CA1/7/2021Super easy, super yummy. Made it on night 1 of the feel good food plan (which my husband was dreading due to healthful mandate) and he loved it! Said he would definitely have it again. Really looking forward to the next 7 nights!!JamieOrange County, CA1/5/2021Made last night - would definitely make again with a couple of changes. I would not salt the salad as directed, the soy sauce adds enough salt. Feel like it could use some citrus to cut the salt and fish sauce a bit - maybe a squeeze of lime will do the trick. Overall a great, light weeknight recipe!feenProvidence, RI1/4/2021Made this tonight for my partner and we loved it! Fresh flavours and quick and fun to cook. We served with rice cooked with coconut milk which probably cancelled out a little of the healthy but it was worth it. Great recipe.Anonymous1/4/2021I have made TONS of BA recipes and many have become go to\u2019s, but I would not recommend this to anyone. Maybe it\u2019s my general dislike for fish sauce forward dishes, but this recipe is just strange. The glaze was very fish sauce forward, but put that aside and the dish still needs some editing.
