When I recently found myself in the neighborhood at 5:30 on a Friday night, hungry and without dinner plans, I decided to stop into the popular local restaurant on my way back to the city. Not taking into account it was the start of the weekend, I drove around the small parking lot for ten minutes before a spot opened up. When I finally sat down among the birthday parties and family dinners, and my pizza made it to my table, I did what many of us tend to do these days: I Instagrammed my meal. A few minutes later I checked my comments and saw a response posted from a friend in Brooklyn: \u201cIs that the way Chicago pizza is sliced? That is insanity.\u201dI could have been offended, but I wasn\u2019t. Instead, I took it as a small win for the Chicagoland area\u2019s underappreciated contribution to the American pizza map: A circular pie with really thin crust, all cut into tiny squares. Some call it \u201cparty cut,\u201d others say it\u2019s \u201ctavern style,\u201d but to locals, it\u2019s just \u201cpizza.\u201d Ask around, and most Chicagoans will tell you that the city\u2019s greatest pies aren\u2019t made in deep pans drowning in layers of cheese and meat at tourist traps like Uno and Lou Malnati\u2019s. Yet, for some reason, people outside the city hardly seem to know the style even exists.\u201cIt\u2019s an original Chicago creation,\u201d boasts Steve Dolinsky, Chicago food writer, television personality, and author of the book Pizza City, USA. \u201cYou have a beer in one hand and something to eat in the other. It\u2019s a product of convenience. Something you don\u2019t fill up on, so you can get home and eat a real dinner.\u201d This explains one theory for the moniker \u201ctavern style,\u201d named for those pre\u2013smoking ban rooms populated by working-class immigrants unwinding after a shift\u2014spaces where neon signs, red plastic pitchers of watery beer, and thin-pies put out as a cheap snack to munch on (and as an encouragement to keep drinking) were all standard fare. More than a half century later, these taverns are still the best places to get a truly good Chicago pie, nestled in the same spots since they first cranked up their ovens.The counter at Vito & Nick\u2019s.\nPhoto by Matt HaasTake Vito & Nick\u2019s, arguably the first\u2014and certainly the longest standing place (vouched for by Dolinsky and Chicago Pizza Tours founder Jonathan Porter)\u2014to offer up Chicago-style thin crust. Third-generation owner Rose Barraco George believes it was her father, Nick Barraco, who originally cut the restaurant\u2019s first pies into squares when they added them in 1946, the year he returned from World War II to take over the business opened by his parents, Sicilian immigrants Vito and Mary Barraco, in 1923. The prices were low, the experience casual. \u201cYou ate it on a napkin,\u201d George says of the pizza. Today\u2019s recipe is the same one George\u2019s grandmother created over 70 years ago.Soon after, other South Side places like Home Run Inn and Italian Fiesta Pizzeria started introducing their own takes on the thin-crust style, and things took off from there.There are no laws governing the tavern-style recipe, so every place makes it differently. Ask most of the people who make it, and they\u2019ll tell you the desired outcome is often described as \u201ccracker crust.\u201d I\u2019ve described it as a texture with the same snap as matzah, but without the cardboard taste and unforgiving mouthfeel. This is pizza we\u2019re talking about; it shouldn\u2019t be a crust of affliction.Barnaby\u2019s, for all its sustained success, is sort of an outlier in this respect. The crust on its pizzas isn\u2019t crispy; it looks more like a pie crust and is chewier than you\u2019ll find in most places. Opening in the South Loop in 2010, Flo & Santos is a relative newcomer to the tavern-style game but has one of the best distributions of give and take I\u2019ve had: The middle pieces have some chew and are topped generously (but not too generously) with sauce and cheese, while the outer parts have the right amount of crackle. Executive chef Mark Rimkus says his dough sits anywhere from 24 to 48 hours to achieve that perfect flatness and then gets cooked at 600 degrees. Rimkus, who was raised on the South Side, says his pizzas fit somewhere between Vito & Nick\u2019s, \u201cjust not as thin,\u201d and another local institution, Palermo\u2019s of 63rd, \u201cjust not as thick.\u201dA pie from Barnaby\u2019s, with its signature crimped crust.\nPhoto by Arun BalakrishnanPorter claims that getting the mozzarella from the Mancuso family in Joliet is \u201cessential.\u201d Some restaurants boast of using organic tomatoes in their homemade sauce, while others rely on cans of Stanislaus. Most agree that the sausage, another point of Chicago pride, must come as little hand-rolled gobs with bits of charred fennel seed. (Many tavern pies only have a single topping so the thin crust won\u2019t break under the weight.) George proudly states that Vito & Nick\u2019s has been sourcing its ingredients from the same local family purveyors for as long as the pizzeria has been around. \u201cI only use small independent businesses. They\u2019re not going to change; their name is on that product,\u201d she says. \u201cWith big companies, you become a number.\u201dThen there\u2019s the oven: Most places use the very unsexy stainless-steel deck ovens that usually cook with gas or electricity\u2014a very practical, get-the-job-done-right appliance. \u201cThat has a real big impact on the flavor and how the pizza comes out,\u201d says Pat Fowler, co-owner and general manager of Candlelite, a Rogers Park institution since 1950. His pizzas are crunchy, with mozzarella cheese toasted orange and gold in the style of an Impressionist\u2019s painting of an autumn day. It\u2019s delicious, but there\u2019s no real showmanship involved in its making\u2014no big fires or smell of burning wood in the air.Loading a pie into the deck oven at Vito & Nick\u2019s.\nPhoto by Matt HaasBut the thing that most defines tavern style is the cut: small, uneven square slices, along with four little witch hat\u2013shaped triangles at the corners. Dolinsky says the term \u201cparty cut\u201d comes from the fact that the manageable portions make it a popular choice for the petite hands at kids\u2019 birthday parties. It sounds nice and simple, but some believe that the pie\u2019s unconventional shape actually has something to do with why it never caught on as Chicago\u2019s signature pizza.\u201cIt\u2019s counterintuitive,\u201d says Chicago-born chef and restaurateur Dale Talde. \u201cChefs try to make things equal,\u201d and most tavern-style pizzas come out anything but. Chef and writer Amy Thielen echoes a similar sentiment. \u201cThe square-cut shape is its downfall,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you think of pizza, you think of an iconic triangle shape. You don\u2019t think of a square.\u201dIts general unsexiness likely isn\u2019t helped by its humble history\u2014first as a cheap, easy snack among hard-working blue collars, and later an easy solve for feeding small, fidgety bodies. It might have been a popular choice, but there wasn\u2019t much glamour to work with.The spread at Flo & Santos, complete with sausages and pierogi.\nPhoto by Katie VoghtBut that still doesn\u2019t explain how deep dish became synonymous with Chicago. Legend, albeit a contested one, has it that in 1943, Ike Sewell, a Texas-born former college football star and founder of Pizzeria Uno (originally called The Pizzeria), initially aimed to bring Tex-Mex to the city. His chef, Rudy Malnati, delivered a recipe for this newfangled pizza instead, and the former All-American Sewell stood outside handing out free slices just the same. The pizza was popular enough that Sewell and his partner, Ric Riccardo, were able to open a second location, Pizzeria Due, a few blocks away in 1955.But what really tipped the balance was a supposed newspaper article that\u2014as Porter puts it\u2014\u201cnobody can seem to find.\u201d (I tried; I couldn\u2019t either.) The myth goes that a writer who\u2019d served in Italy during World War II claimed he\u2019d never had a better pie than the original Uno deep dish. That one statement alone linked the style (and the pizzeria) to Chicago, and lodged it in the American conscience as a pie worth trying.Over the next several decades, Uno inspired a wave of imitators: Gino\u2019s East in 1966, Lou Malnati\u2019s (Rudy\u2019s son) in 1971, Pequod\u2019s in the suburb of Morton Grove that same year. Chicago-style deep dish even made its way into cookbooks as an alternative to the traditional casserole, which some might say has more in common with deep dish than actual pizzaThe OG Pizzaria Uno.\nPhoto courtesy Pizzeria UnoThough they arguably had a head start on Sewell and Malnati\u2019s creation, the thin-crust, square-cut pies of places like Vito & Nick\u2019s didn\u2019t achieve the same level of fandom. (Part of that might be due to the fact that it shares similarities with other nascent midwestern pizza styles of the time, including St. Louis style pizza, started in 1947 by Amedeo Fiore, who had moved from Chicago in the 1930s.) The party-cut pies could never catch up to the deep-dish boom.Barnaby\u2019s, which opened its first location in 1969, billing itself as a \u201ccome as you are\u201d place with \u201can informal old English pub atmosphere,\u201d attempted expansion into other states like Indiana, Wisconsin, Missouri, Virginia, and Florida in the mid-70s, only to see many of its franchises close by the end of the next decade. The reasons were varied but competition with the proliferation of national chains like Pizza Hut, Little Caesars, and Domino\u2019s, not to mention family-friendly places like Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s didn\u2019t help. In the years since, very few new places have opened making tavern style\u2014and even fewer of them have been that good.The bar at Vito & Nick\u2019s.\nPhoto by Matt HaasBut that doesn\u2019t change its standing among true Chicago pizza appreciators. \u201cWe own this,\u201d chef Dale Talde says with the pride of a Chicagoan who loves to remind you how many championships Michael Jordan won with the Bulls. \u201cWhen people talk about cheesesteaks in Philly, it\u2019s always the people who aren\u2019t from Philly that try to tell you where to go eat a good cheesesteak. Everyone in Philly will go, \u2018Yeah, you go eat at Pat\u2019s or Geno\u2019s if you want. Go wait in line like all the other schmucks because I\u2019m going to John\u2019s Roast Pork.\u2019 I\u2019ll let all the tourists eat at Lou Malnati\u2019s and Gino\u2019s East; I\u2019m gonna go to Barnaby\u2019s.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titChicagoPizzaRestaurantsRecipes you want to make.
