While rebellion was ongoing throughout slavery, the Revolution began in 1791 and by 1804, Haitians had wrested control from the French. Black people in Haiti had been forbidden from eating soup joumou during enslavement, as the dish was a delicacy. Upon independence, the dish became a symbol for Black Haitians' freedom. This is my take on it.This recipe was excerpted from \u2018The Rise: Black Cooks and the Soul of American Food.\u2019\u00a0Editor\u2019s note: We\u2019ve updated the name and byline of this dish, and changed the headnote to match the excerpted recipe, which is chef Marcus Samuelsson's take on Haitian soup joumou, from\u00a0 Samuelsson\u2019s cookbook \u2018The Rise.\u2019 We apologize for misrepresenting this recipe.Ingredients8 ServingsCandied Spiced Nuts1\u00bdcups raw almonds, walnuts, or pecans3Tbsp. pure maple syrup1Tbsp. vegetable oil1tsp. berbere\u00bdtsp.

Let cool, then coarsely chop and set aside.Chile-nutmeg oilStep 3Place red pepper flakes and nutmeg in a small heatproof bowl.

Add garlic, season with salt, and cook, stirring often, until garlic is softened, 3\u20135 minutes. Add squash and cook, stirring, just until coated in onion mixture, about 1 minute. Add bundle and pour in stock; season with a bit more salt.

It was worth the effort and I would make it again.AnonymousDetroit MI12/19/2021Quest-ce que c'est?? How is the editor changing the recipe for this soupe de potiron & noix? Anonymousguess?11/6/2021Bro this is by far the wildest review section I\u2019ve ever seen for a recipe. I accidentally bought 20 small pumpkins today though so I\u2019ll be trying out this soup soon.TremuloHouston, Tx10/19/2021Sak sa?? You should never change the recipe to accommodate white people this is a disgrace\nTHIS IS NOT SOUP JOUMOUAnonymousMontreal9/17/2021Excellent (and thank you).\nI really loved this recipe, and will make it again.  Also, I had never heard of Soup Joumou nor knew anything about its origin. After reading the article and making the soup, I looked it up because I wanted to know more.  So, for everyone out there who is upset, there are a lot of positives here.  Because of the recipe, I (a white man) learned more about the Haitian culture and history.  I would encourage everyone to look at the positives and realize there are many variations to \u201ctraditional dishes.\u201d  RyanAtlanta, GA1/17/2021Well well Marcus... how does it feel when the mob comes for you? Forget about all these racist commenters who thought you were a. white and b. born in the US. Forget that you were invited into a Haitians home who literally told you that everyone has their own take on this recipe. Forget you are an accomplished chef and have to listen to 200+ hacks pretend they know anything about cooking. If this was an SNL skit it would be hysterical. Haitians arguing about a soup the way New Yorkers argue about pizza. I hope no Haitian ever tries to pass of a classic French dish as their own. Can you imagine the outrage if they made a croque monsieur with cheddar instead of gruyere? Admit it now, that stuff with Rappaport was always just about caving to cancel and faux rage culture and you and everyone that survived the purge at BA thought you were immune. Nope. Remember it\u2019s easier to tear something down than to actually build something up. Kudos to the handful of thoughtful commenters who even though disliked the recipe avoided the racist and rage trap. Not a good look for the Haitian community on here to be honest. Fake rage is about power1/15/2021This is a disgrace! Not an accurate representation of our culture and is disrespectful. This recipe is white-washed and should be removed!Miranda LNJ12/31/2020Should we all  tag Bon Appetit, come Jan 1st! #RealSoupJoumouJen Philly 12/23/2020This is pure sacrilege. Ou pa ta f\u00e8 nou sa Makis! (Now how do you feel when you see me spell your name like that?)Haitian motherMiami, FL12/10/2020This is beyond a misrepresentation. It\u2019s an entirely new recipe. The mention of Haiti and the celebration of its Independence Day needs to be removed from this article. Anonymous12/9/2020HE WAS TAUGHT BY HAITIANS ON HOW TO MAKE SOUP JOUMOU!!! LOOK AT THIS VIDEO>>> httpss://youtu.be/zF-01UlnCp8AnonymousMiami, Fl12/8/2020Independence Day is coming up and y\u2019all should know this is not the soup that we drink to celebrate. It\u2019s a tradition that\u2019s important to us. It would\u2019ve been nice to present this dish separate from anything related to joumou.\nAnonymous12/7/2020Disgusting on every level. Stop trying to white wash Haitian history. I cope somebody turns the person who made this into a cat.AnonymousNew York, NY12/7/2020How did we get here?  Where an artist can no longer use his gifts to interpret something he finds beautiful?  Imagine if we silenced Picasso because his interpretation of The Weeping Woman didn't fit into our view of a woman? Or if we silenced Monet because his Lillies weren't precise? Marcus clearly meant no disrespect. He was using his artistic expression to bring attention to a very important part of Haiti history.  shelly los Angeles, ca 12/7/2020This is a terrible way of depicting our nation. I shouldn't be able to search soup joumou and this pops up.
