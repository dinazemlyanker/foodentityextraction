We\u2019re Donating to Anti-Racist Groups Anyway.Jeremiah Stone isn\u2019t sure if his NYC restaurants will survive COVID-19. But he\u2019s going to support the people protesting for George Floyd for as long as he can.By Jeremiah Stone, as told to Elyse InamineJune 1, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailJeremiah Stone donated his restaurants's weekend sales to organizations supporting protesters in Minneapolis.Photo by Haruka SakaguchiFacebookTwitterEmailIn the last week, protests have erupted across the country in response to the murder of George Floyd, and food businesses everywhere have spoken out in solidarity. Jeremiah Stone and Fabi\u00e1n von Hauske, the chefs and owners of Wildair, Contra, and wine shop Peoples Wine in New York City, were two of those who took a stand. Last Friday, they posted one image with no comment: an announcement that weekend sales would go toward the Minnesota Freedom Fund, which helps those who\u2019ve been arrested post bail, and Reclaim the Block, a Minneapolis-based organization focused on decreasing funding towards police and increasing community-based safety measures. They were one of the first restaurant owners I saw do this; since then, many more have pledged donations. These efforts feel especially poignant given how much the industry has been devastated by COVID-19. I imagined that this small act was a big thing for Stone and von Hauske\u2019s little restaurant group. So, yesterday, I hopped on the phone with Stone to talk about what led him to take action and how the pandemic made him realize that now was the time. \u2013Elyse InamineThe future of restaurants, the future of our restaurants, the economy: It all feels so messed up. Right now, we\u2019re not making a profit, and I won\u2019t pretend that we are. Between our two restaurants, we\u2019re doing one-twentieth of our usual business. But once I heard about the murder of George Floyd, I was just like, things are getting even worse.I saw it on social media, this image of someone with their knee on someone\u2019s neck. Within a few seconds of seeing it, you could feel the oppression, even if you didn\u2019t read the story. I was pretty shocked, but unfortunately I knew this kind of police behavior was so common\u2014so common that an incident like this was recorded and being shown on every news outlet. Racial injustice and police brutality are as old as time, but in my lifetime, they still feel like issues that are so overwhelming and you don\u2019t know where to start to be involved. As I watched at home, I felt restless. With social media, it\u2019s all talk and no action. And I just felt defeated.I\u2019m a cook. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing for the last 16 years, and it\u2019s all I know. I didn\u2019t even go to college. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m the person to affect policy change or something like that. But I know I can make food. I know we can control the money we make from that food and have it go to people who need it. So I started to think about what we can do as a small business that\u2019s obviously struggling. We don\u2019t have a lot that we can offer. We\u2019re working everyday; we\u2019re trying to be responsible for our staff and those they\u2019re supporting. So I thought, maybe we could give a little bit of what we\u2019re making in sales to causes that are supporting the protesters in Minneapolis. We were already making so little, and the margins were so tight, that it seemed like not the smartest thing to do. On the other hand, everything feels so uncertain anyway, so why not just do it?So last week, I called Fabi\u00e1n and Daryl [Nuhn], our partner at Peoples, and asked them, \u201cWhat do you think about donating the money that we make from the weekend to the Minnesota Freedom Fund and Reclaim the Block?\u201d Both of them had George Floyd on their mind. They were like, yes, yes, yes.Chef Jeremiah Stone\nAlbert Cheung Photography LLCWe basically gave away everything we made over the weekend at the restaurants except for what we owe in terms of delivery fees and food costs. At Peoples, we gave away the margin we made from the wines we sold, and some of our favorite wine importers matched our giving. After we did the calculations, we raised $20,000 in total.  We apparently had double the amount of wine sales we usually have because people bought to support. But this isn\u2019t just about money; it\u2019s about bringing awareness and attention to this issue of racial injustice. Money is just the vehicle.Fabi\u00e1n and I talk about race a lot, with him being Mexican and me being Chinese. But this is the first time that we\u2019ve responded as a restaurant in this way. I don\u2019t think we did anything heroic. I just wanted to make a point. I grew up in a very diverse area in Maryland, just outside of D.C. So I\u2019ve always felt like it\u2019s important to stand behind a cause like this because I\u2019m a person of color. As an Asian American, you grow up confused. There is a privilege and unspoken passability at times, but also a sense of not being fully accepted as well.Around this time last year, we were at Dooky Chase\u2019s in New Orleans. It was amazing to hear the granddaughter of Leah Chase [the legendary chef and co-owner who passed away last year] tell us stories and show us the dining room where tons of civil rights activists have eaten. There was a picture of MLK at Dooky Chase. Obviously, our restaurants are not the Dooky Chase of New York. But I\u2019ve always felt like we were given our spots for a reason. At its core, a restaurant should be a place that serves people. Anything that gets in the way of being hospitable to everyone is against what a restaurant stands for, or at least that\u2019s what I think.I don\u2019t know if our restaurants are going to make it through the next year or the next couple years. So if we\u2019re going to go out, if this is the last thing we ever do, it might as well mean something. We\u2019re not going to talk about how broken the industry is or how little support we\u2019re getting from the government. That seems silly right now. Now, more than ever, we\u2019re going to do what represents us. We\u2019re going to support the people on the front lines of change.Explore Bon App\u00e9titNew YorkFirst PersonRestaurantsCoronavirusRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
