The kind of kitchen wizard who has a tried-and-true arsenal of effortless, no-fail dishes up your sleeve? Well, friend, the Basically 10x10 is here for you. The idea is simple: ten essential recipes served up over the course of ten weeks via our nifty newsletter, which you can sign up for here! Just do it! It's FREE! And awesome! We promise!.Here's how it works. From September 9th until November 11th, we'll send out a Sunday newsletter featuring a new, soon-to-be-in-heavy-rotation-in-your-kitchen recipe along with a short shopping list of the ingredients that you'll need to make it. And for the next week, it'll be all about that recipe on Basically. We'll be posting Instagram Stories featuring BA staffers cooking through the dish, as well as a Wednesday Q&A with our editors where we help you troubleshoot. We'll be publishing stories that reinforce the learnings that the recipe has to offer. And, of course, we want you to cook the damn thing before the next recipe hits your inbox, take a photo of it, and post it to Instagram with the hashtag #Basically10x10 for a chance to be featured in our end-of-week Story.Say cheese!\nPhoto by Heidi's BridgeBut the real party is going down in your kitchen. Because the cool thing is that each of these recipes is built like an at-home cooking class. As we guide you step-by-step through the recipes, we'll also be calling out all of the techniques we encounter along the way that are key not just to that recipe, but all of the recipes like it that you might ever come across. We're not just going to tell you to put what seems like an outrageous amount of salt into your pasta water, or to sling a couple of tablespoons of butter into the pan right before you serve your spaghetti\u2014we're also going to tell you why and how those steps play a part in the creation of the glossiest, most perfectly seasoned plate of restaurant-worthy pasta you've ever made in your life. So while you're building a roster of delicious, doable dishes that you'll want to cook (and eat!) on repeat, you're also gaining the skills you need to tackle a whole world of other recipes with confidence. Cool, right?So, yeah, we're going to teach you how to make a dumb-easy spaghetti pomodoro that will blow your mind. And how to roast a whole chicken so that you nail it every time, all juicy meat and browned, crackling skin. And how to make a crunchy salad with the simplest homemade yogurt ranch to replace that sad mesclun-mix-and-bottled-Italian-dressing sitch. But you're going to get a whole lot more than dinner out of it. Let's do this!What're you waiting for?
