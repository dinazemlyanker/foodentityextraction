As a kid, I snacked on lemon wedges, horrifying my parents and dentists alike. I\u2019ve since stopped for the sake of my enamel and digestive system, but I still use an abundance of acidic ingredients in everything I cook. No pot of chickpeas is complete without a good squeeze of lemon; no dipping sauce is perfect until some rice vinegar joins the party. I\u2019ve amassed a small collection of acidic ingredients, but lately I\u2019ve ignored it for Pineapple Collaborative\u2019s Apple Cider Vinegar.This is my first real ACV crush. Despite its health halo and widespread availability, I rarely reached for the stuff. But Pineapple Collaborative\u2019s ACV is the first I\u2019ve tried that actually tastes like, well, apples, and that got me hooked. I suspect that\u2019s because it\u2019s \u201ccrafted in collaboration\u201d with farmer Joanne Krueger of Little Apple Treats orchard in California\u2019s Sonoma County. The vinegar is made by fermenting a blend of Krueger\u2019s organic Gravenstein, Red Rome Beauty, Golden Delicious, and Pink Pearl apples.Truly, this vinegar is potent stuff: Just a tablespoon or two is enough to wake up any dish with a jolt of bright, shimmering, sweet-and-sour fruitiness. I\u2019ve made countless quick weeknight salad dressing by shaking up a few tablespoons with Dijon mustard, olive oil, and a bit of honey. But I\u2019ve also added a splash to mellow out saccharine homemade jam, stirred it into weekly batches of acidic green sauce, and shot it back straight as a DIY wellness shot. The world is my oyster and I\u2019m going to keep spiking it with vinegar forever...or at least until I drain the bottle.Photo by Laura MurrayPineapple Collaborative Apple Cider Vinegar$20 at Pineapple CollaborativeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendShoppingApple Cider VinegarRead MoreLifestyleThese Are a Few of My Favorite FatsBy Christina ChaeyRecipes you want to make.
