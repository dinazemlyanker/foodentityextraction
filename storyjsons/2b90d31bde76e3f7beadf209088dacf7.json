It\u2019s nutty, textured, and not-too-sweet. We preferred Nabisco chocolate wafers here, but you could also use Oreos or any chocolate cookie your heart desires.IngredientsMakes about 8 cups\u00bdcup (70 g) black sesame seeds114-oz. can sweetened condensed milk1tsp. kosher salt2cups heavy cream3oz. chocolate wafer cookies, crushed into large pieces (about 1 cup)PreparationStep 1Toast sesame seeds in a dry large skillet over medium heat, stirring often, until fragrant and just starting to crackle, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a food processor or blender and pulse, scraping down sides as needed, until seeds are finely chopped but haven\u2019t formed a paste, about 3 minutes in a food processor, and about 2 minutes in a blender.Step 2Mix together ground sesame seeds, condensed milk, and salt in a medium bowl.Step 3Using an electric mixer, beat cream in a small bowl, starting on low speed and gradually increasing to medium-high as it thickens, until billowy and stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes.Step 4Add a dollop of whipped cream to condensed milk mixture and mix in with a rubber spatula (this is just to lighten it so that the next stage\u2014folding\u2014is easier). Add remaining whipped cream and fold in, running spatula down sides and along bottom of bowl and lifting up through center and over top while rotating bowl to integrate without deflating, until very few streaks of condensed milk mixture remain. Fold in crushed cookies; scrape ice cream base into a loaf pan that\u2019s at least 8\u00bdx4\u00bd\". Cover with plastic wrap or an airtight silicone lid and freeze until solid, at least 8 hours.Step 5To serve, transfer loaf pan to refrigerator and let ice cream soften 10 minutes before scooping into bowls.Step 6Do ahead: Ice cream can be made 1 week ahead. Keep frozen.How would you rate Cookies and Black Sesame Cream?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleThis is seriously magic. Not only is it very easy to put together, but the end result has the texture you expect from ice cream with even richer flavor. As someone with a tiny kitchen who can't have an ice cream maker, my prayers have been answered here. Can't wait to try more flavors with this base formula.bentley_weisNew York6/15/2020I was so excited when I saw this recipe- my family was skeptical. But this ice cream was easy to make, and pure magic. Creamy, nutty, and deeply flavored. Definitely use the Nabisco chocolate wafers- better than oreos in this application! Thank you Sarah for another awesome recipe!\nJust make it!emmykSeattle6/8/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titIce CreamFrozen DessertDessertSummerEasy5 Ingredients or FewerRecipes you want to make.
