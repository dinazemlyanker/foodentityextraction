Up next, Maile Makaafi, a second-year dancer with the Radio City Rockettes, lets us shadow her for a day of athletic training, high kicks, and French twists.Maile Makaafi\u2019s job hinges on high kicks. The 22-year-old is in her second year dancing with the Radio City Rockettes\u2014the iconic armada of statuesque women whose seasonal Christmas Spectacular has topped New York City tourists\u2019 to-do lists since 1932.Makaafi was born in Hawaii and grew up in Arizona, where she first saw the Rockettes perform on tour. \u201cI totally fell in love,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cIt was special to see tall women in particular doing something so powerful together\u2014I hit a growth spurt in 7th grade and at thirteen I was already a giant!\u201d She moved to New York to study dance at Pace University in 2015, and two years ago, a professor encouraged her to skip class to attend the annual Rockettes audition. She made the cut and spent her senior year writing her honors thesis backstage.Technically being a Rockette is a seasonal gig: A grueling six weeks of rehearsals starts in October, and performances begin in November and run through the new year. Each show, the six-thousand-seat hall is filled with the promise of kick lines, lifesize toy soldiers, and Santa\u2014while, backstage, a cast of 36 dancers flies through quick-changes and steals power naps between performances, which can climb to four per day.\u201cThe work we do here is really athletic, though I think from the audience it doesn\u2019t read that way\u2014because half of our job is making it look easy,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re doing up to 200 kicks in a show, on top of all the other precision choreography.\u201d Here\u2019s how Makaafi gets through a day of performances, from practicing mindfulness backstage to perfecting the signature Rockette French twist.Photo by Emma FishmanBreakfast and BCAAsMy alarm goes off at 8 a.m., so I actually get out of bed at 8:30 a.m. I make coffee and eggs over easy on toast\u2014something filling but not too overwhelming, because we\u2019re moving around so much\u2014and get out the door ASAP. I like to get to Radio City about an hour and a half before the first show, if the trains are running in my favor.Normally when I get to the hall I take a second to decompress, because there's always something happening on the subway. I always drink water with a couple scoops of BCAAs (branched-chain amino acids) because it helps me a lot with muscle fatigue. If I\u2019m feeling under the weather, I'll also mix in a packet of Emergen-C. I\u2019m trying to get the other girls hooked on this combo and, so far, nobody has gotten too sick.Photo by Emma FishmanPerfecting the French twistWe do all our own hair and makeup, and there\u2019s a lot of conversing in the dressing room about what we did the night before and who is coming to the show. Everyone has their own technique, but the rule of thumb is a lash, a liner, and a Rockette red lip. Oh, and we have our signature French twist. I totally YouTubed it before I auditioned for the Rockettes for the first time. I have huge curly hair, and we wear so many hats and wigs during the show, so the twist is practical as well.Photo by Emma FishmanMuscle warm ups and backstage quick changesI've been having trouble with my ankles recently, so I like to come up to the athletic training department before the show. We have foam rollers, gym equipment, and warm whirlpools, so I dip my legs in there to warm up my muscles. I try to warm up my feet especially because we wear 2.5\u20133 inch heels the whole performance, and we dance on a steel stage, which is hard on your joints.I\u2019ll do one last makeup check to make sure my lipstick didn\u2019t get ruined from my BCAA Emergen-C magic, and I put on my costume on. Everything during the next 90 minutes will happen on stage or just off it. I think it\u2019s more common for dancers to go to their dressing rooms, but we have a lot of fast costume changes during the show so we\u2019ll just go to a hallway or booth. It\u2019s the most efficient way to get on and off stage without running into traffic. We have lots of moving parts: singers, ice skaters, aerialists, and the most amazing ensemble.Photo by Emma FishmanFamily meal, power naps, and embroideryAfter the show we\u2019ll take off our costumes and wipe all the sweat off, because that\u2019s when it really hits. I try to make my makeup last as long as possible because taking it off and reapplying it puts my skin through a lot. Then we always gather upstairs for a family meal and eat together. I love anything that\u2019s build-your-own, whether it\u2019s Mediterranean or Mexican, because everyone gets the chance to customize it. Some meals are catered from local vendors around Radio City, which is nice.If I can squeeze in a ten-minute nap between shows, I feel so refreshed that the next show feels like a new day. You forget you just did 90 minutes of hard cardio! I\u2019m a fall-asleep-anywhere kind of girl, but I like listening to guided meditations on Headspace. I'll put my headphones in and try to cover my eyes with a blanket because if I wear an eye mask it messes up my makeup too much. If I don\u2019t have time to nap I\u2019ll just chill. My mom bought me an embroidery hoop for my birthday, and I'm learning the satin stitch right now. I also have a cactus pattern that I\u2019m working on next. It\u2019s my ode to home.Photo by Emma FishmanCool down and fuel upAfter the last show, I like to take all my makeup off and let my hair loose. Sometimes I\u2019ll shower here too. I\u2019ll definitely take a quick stop at athletic training so I can get into the ice or a cold whirlpool to cool down my muscles and help them recover for the next day.I like to eat as soon as the show ends to replace all the energy I was just expending, and I get especially hungry if I don't. I really like making my own Hawaiian comfort food because it\u2019s hard to find that here in New York. I love a chicken mix plate with a mac salad (marinated grilled chicken with macaroni salad), but my ultimate comfort food at the end of a long work day is loco moco. I think it was put together by surfers one day; it\u2019s just rice with a beef patty, gravy, and a fried egg on top. Very high carb and high protein.After a really long show day, I\u2019ll use Headspace to unwind at home. You get such a rush of adrenaline when you're on stage, and it\u2019s hard to run home, and turn that off.Explore Bon App\u00e9titOffice CrushHealthyishInterviewsRead MoreLifestyleAriana Grande's Brooklyn Tattoo Artist Is Winning at Work and Basically Everything ElseBy Ali FrancisRecipes you want to make.
