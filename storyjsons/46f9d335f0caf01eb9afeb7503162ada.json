It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.With friends like these...We had a blast handing out minty limeade (in compostable cups) and tiny produce-themed pins at the Union Square Greenmarket last weekend to promote Healthyish\u2019s Farmers\u2019 Market Challenge. Some stoppers-by shared their thoughts on the limeade: \u201cToooo sweet!\u201d \u201cToo tart!\u201d \u201cJust sweet enough!\u201d And then the bear family came home and scared them all away. Just kidding. It was a man on his cell phone, telling the person on the other line: \u201cI can\u2019t believe they have that [ADULT WORDS FOR POOP AND BUTT] Bon App\u00e9tit magazine here!\u201d He looked into my eyes and enunciated \u201cPA-THE-TIC\u201d and walked away. Strollin\u2019 and trollin\u2019!Get the recipe: Minty limeade (feel free to add sugar to your preference)Photo by Rick MartinezPostcard from Cape CodCarla, Claire, Andy, Brad, Rick, Molly, and Christina went clamming while shooting [REDACTED] in Cape Cod this week. Claire and Rick turned out to be the most skilled, while Carla and Chris \u201csupervised.\u201d They dug up enough clams with their feet and then steamed them with white wine, ginger, garlic, shallots, and sriracha. \u201cYou get so disgusting clamming,\u201d Christina told me. \u201cThe mud and dirt had arranged itself on my body in such a way, it looked like I had chest hair.\u201d Back at the hotel, Chris would send the whole team a text every morning announcing his coffee pop-up, Caf\u00e9 du Morocco, was open. Yes, Chris Morocco brings his own hand-grinder, electric kettle, and Intelligentsia beans on vacation. He made everyone a strong cup of Aeropress, leaving his room door propped open for the incoming sleepyheads.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Courtesy of A24See this movieLast weekend I finally saw The Farewell. All food-loving people, and people-loving people, will love it.  I won\u2019t give away the plot, but it will make you laugh your face off and wipe away tears with your popcorn napkin. But as Jenny G. Zhang wrote for Eater, the scenes of the Chinese family gathered at a huge round table of seemingly endless food mirror the ways families share grief as if it too is being spun around on a lazy susan. Go see this movie! And then listen to our interview with director Lulu Wang on the Bon App\u00e9tit Foodcast next Wednesday.And one moreIf you can, schedule your weekend around finding a theater playing The Pieces I Am, the inspiring and phenomenal Toni Morrison documentary. It has nothing to do with food, EXCEPT that the unmatched American author, who died this week, was known to make an incredible carrot cake (especially for her authors when she was an editor at Random House\u2014can you imagine?!). I don\u2019t have the recipe, but in the doc, she does reveal it was heavy on the carrots. Maybe one day we\u2019ll learn the rest.Recipe comment of the weekGet the recipe, bad boys: Tomato GaletteSummer pigeonsIf a seagull is inching toward your big ass beach hoagie this weekend, stare him dead in the eyes until he backs off, according to Munchies. It\u2019s called \u201cgaze aversion,\u201d a practice I\u2019m all too familiar with.Unnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekI called the Test Kitchen crew as they journeyed back to New York in a big passenger van driven by...Brad Leone. \u201cSo what\u2019d I miss this week?\u201d I asked van-rider Christina Chaey. She said that Carla Lalli Music was eating a mini Kind bar that\u2019d been sitting in a hot van for two days. Things were getting savage. But the biggest feud in Cape Cod started when Carla poo-pooed pink peppercorns in an upcoming recipe because they\u2019re \u201cfunny.\u201d \u201cTo me, pink peppercorns feel like peak 1984,\u201d she said. Andy Baraghani has nothing against their flavor and mellow heat, but \u201cthere are other ingredients that have a prettier color that don\u2019t remind of clothes from \u201990s Wet Seal.\u201d Pick a decade, people! Others were apathetic. \u201cI would use pink peppercorns if I had them leftover from a Williams-Sonoma gift basket or something,\u201d said Meryl Rothstein. It was Brad who advocated for the pink pep, saying he \u201cjust really digs them\u2014they\u2019re floral and fruity.\u201d And if anyone else says another word against them, he\u2019ll turn this car around\u2026Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecultureWhat My Dream Grocery Store Looks LikeBy Alex BeggscultureCook the Cover!
