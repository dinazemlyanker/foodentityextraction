Milestone holidays still have to happen\u2014even though it feels like they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to. Personally, I didn\u2019t want to get another year older while I sat alone in my apartment watching The Sopranos, but, hey, that\u2019s just how the cookie crumbles.Then I stumbled upon Internet Cookies, a delivery service for one-of-a-kind baked goods, the one bright spot among the darkness of COVID-19. I\u2019ve since sent them to friends for their birthdays, my mom on Mother\u2019s Day, and myself (just because!). As advertised, they truly are cookies that you buy on the internet.\u00a0Founded a year and a half ago by Gaia Valdemarsd\u00f3ttir\u2014who wanted to leave behind the demanding hours she had as a restaurant cook and pastry chef\u2014Internet Cookies offers a monthly subscription and one-off orders of homemade cookies made with unusual ingredients. Each month there\u2019s a new cookie that Valdemarsd\u00f3ttir develops out of her kitchen in Santa Fe, New Mexico, with ingredients pulling from her childhood spent in the Faroe Islands, summers with her Czech family in Prague, and other international travels. Past cookies have included combinations like emmer, turmeric, banana, and salt-cured pepper; another was with dried and fresh blueberries, roasted hazelnuts, lavender-infused butter, and maple flakes. And I\u2019d be remiss to not mention the noteworthy pistachio marzipan cookie.For September, Valdemarsd\u00f3ttir is offering a particularly delightful-sounding Blenheim apricot-dukkah-Cracker-Jack concoction. Her treats are consistently much more inspiring than a classic snickerdoodle or chocolate chip and with just as much warmth baked inside; I wish she\u2019d open a bakery with them all near my house.Despite the company\u2019s tech-forward name, Valdemarsd\u00f3ttir has a pretty light online presence\u2014the website is really more of a casual blog\u2014and most of her sales currently come from word-of-mouth recommendations. In internet realm, accepting cookies gives websites personalized information about its users. But on this website, \u201caccepting cookies\u201d means you\u2019ve become pen pals with the leader of a very sweet cookie club. The clandestine, low-profile feeling of it all carries over to the no-frills packaging\u2014labeled only with the company\u2019s name in a Gothic-style font\u2014which reminds me of when my parents would attempt to send me hidden contraband (candy) at my childhood sleepaway camp.\u201cI think what I love the most about sending people cookies is that I send them to all sorts of people in all sorts of professions and backgrounds. When I started this, I sort of thought that my customers would be all the same, but I\u2019ve come to learn that a lot of different people love weird cookies, from people located at army bases to grandmas and more,\u201d she tells me.During the pandemic, ordering food gifts online has proven to be incredibly unpredictable with so many delivery slots already snatched up and items sold out without a restock date in sight. But Internet Cookies has been an entirely reliable source of joy, and at $20 (shipping included) for six cookies, a well-priced gift for anyone in need of a pick-me-up or celebration.\u00a0Buy It: $20 for six cookies (shipping included)\u00a0All products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
