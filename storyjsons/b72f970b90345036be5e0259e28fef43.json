Our summery tacos rely on our go-to fish-cooking method\u2014slow-roast, baby!\u2014for tender, flaky fish every time. Because white fish (think cod or tilapia) is so mild, we took a cue from Contramar\u2019s Red and Green Grilled Snapper and covered it in a garlicky cilantro-chile sauce before cooking. You\u2019re not going to get the same char or crunch as you would in grilled or fried fish tacos, but a cabbage slaw (and the fact that you don\u2019t have to deal with grilling or frying) more than makes up for it. Use any mild white fish you like, remembering that cook time varies based on the thickness of the piece. So keep an eye on the fish as it cooks and cook to the visual indicator, not the timer.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Had all the ingredients. Loved the oven-cooking of the fish. Had a bunch of starting-to-wilt cilantro. Spiced up your homemade pico with some ground habanero. Used up the half-cut avocado in the fridge. (PS: I always have a cabbage, some limes, jalaenos, and bag of tortillas around.) This goes on my emergency list..Loretta NY-BOS3/13/2022ZERO flavor. Won\u2019t be making these again. AnonymousMonterey, CA9/2/2021This was delicious!  My guests raved about the flavor of  the fish! tomaMichigan 5/10/2021I am so impressed with this recipe: simple, quick, yet so impressive! I will definitely be making this again and again.\n\nA note about spice: I wasn't expecting much spice at all after reading the reviews, so I was surprised that the puree had the perfect amount of heat (and I love spicy food). My jalapenos were on the large side, so it makes sense in hindsight. I can't imagine a scenario where someone would eat this and think it's not spicy at all, though I suppose it's hard to predict how much heat each jalapeno will have.MeaganSan Francisco, CA1/23/2021These were pretty good! I followed the recipe exactly, and the fish came out perfectly cooked (I used Atlantic cod and it was a winner!) and it was not spicy at all (despite using 2 jalape\u00f1os w/ the seeds). My only complaint was it definitely felt like something was missing. Next time I make it, I'll probably add some finely chopped fresh jalape\u00f1os or serrano peppers to the pico de gallo to kick up the heat, some sort of aioli or crema on the cabbage instead of the lime juice and some cojita on top! But overall great fish taco recipe! LauraRockville, MD11/9/2020these were great! We added extra garlic, cuz why not, and the fish came out soooo tasty! The flavours were bright and delicious, everyone at the table enjoyed this recipeAnonymousQuebec, Canada7/22/2020These were fantastic and hit the spot! We only had barramundi, tobasco sauce, almond flour tortillas, no avocado, and no cabbage but the fish tacos came out amazing!!!! AnonymousManhattan, NYC6/2/2020Trying to add more fish into our diet.  This was very good!   Brocolli slaw (instead of cabbage) and Siracha for the hot sauce.  Make again for sure!!!AnonymousAnnapolis, MD1/20/2020This was fantastic, especially with homemade corn tortillas. We made it with cod, which released a fair amount of water as it was cooking and loosened up the sauce, but otherwise, it was great!AnonymousMontreal1/20/2020Fantastic, simple, and feels so healthy. Pulled two frozen tilapia fillets out of the freezer and swapped out green cabbage for red cabbage -- I salted it a bit and massaged beforehand to break it down just a little. I grabbed some perfect juicy-ripe cherry tomatoes from the farmers market and it turned what could have been a sad tilapia dinner into something I literally want to eat all the time. Nate GLos Angeles, CA9/27/2019I've made this recipe 4 times since it was published- it's quickly become a favorite in our rotation!\nThe recipe comes together really quickly and easily. It's nice to have 2 people make this and have one person in charge of all the chopping.\n\nIn addition to the standard recipe, it's easy to \"spin it\" (Carla's term from her cookbook). You can make a corn salsa or a mango salsa depending on what looks good at the market, top it with some chile sauce, replace the cabbage with a crunchy green, replace the tortillas with butter lettuce, etc. Make it your own with what you have & what looks good/is in season! \nI also love the addition of a tablespoon of greek yogurt to the cabbage for some creaminess.\nIf your jalapenos are too spicy, make sure youre removing the seeds AND the ribs- thats where the majority of the heat is. AnonymousChicago9/23/2019I thought - no cheese?? But this really was delicious. So fresh and limey. Make it!AnonymousBrooklyn9/15/2019This was sooo quick and easy - literally a 30 min meal! I ended up using tilapia, 3 jalape\u00f1os, red onion instead of white, threw in an extra Dorot crushed garlic cube, and used a purple cabbage slaw/habanero lime tortillas from TJs (just what I had on hand). They came out delish!! Tasted like something you\u2019d get at a restaurant. Going to be making this one often. You rock Molly Baz!AnonymousFlorida9/2/2019Really good! I am sensitive to spice and found that the 2 jalapenos overtook all flavor. Next time I make it, I will likely only use one. Rhode Island8/21/2019Totally delicious! I added lime juice and some extra garlic to the cilantro pesto for a little extra pop. I might even double the amount of the sauce next time. This recipe was also outrageously easy, and a contained 30 minute meal. Thanks for the out of the park hit, Molly.AnonymousCambridge, MA8/16/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titTacoMexicanLatin AmericanFishSeafoodCilantroHerbs & SpicesJalape\u00f1oChileVegetableQuickEasyWeeknight MealsMainNut-FreeRoastDinnerBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
