Chris Morocco is a legend at mastering and enhancing basics. Highly recommend finding or making some milk bread. Best bread I've had in my life comes from Takahachi Bakery in NYC \u2013 worth the trip.AnonymousMemphis, TN2/9/2022Absolutely delicious. My husband asked, \"Can we make this again tomorrow?\"ClairePA, USA6/10/2021What type of pickles I can use please. suniaLondon, UK5/5/2021As everyone has already said this is great. Just popping in to say it worked great using tofu in place of the chicken. Get a block that\u2019s pretty firm, press for about 30mins. I cut my block into 6 slices. Also we have a spice baby in the fam so I cut the hot sauce by half and the cayenne back to 1T and that still read as spicy but tolerable for the spice baby. If making it for self I would use the original amounts though. Everybody loved it! We\u2019ll be back. BananaMartiniElkins Park, PA 3/22/2021This recipe is insanely good.  Perfect amount of heat and crunch.  The whole family loved itMirjana VukasWestern Springs, IL2/8/2021Great recipe! I used some homemade pickles and served this to my parents while visiting home. Big hit and will be making it again soon! The type of sandwich I crave in the middle of the workweek when I'm sick of eating leftover curry or stir fry.Izzy SiedmanPortland, ME12/11/2020DELICIOUS! Intense heat and amazing crunch. A regular dish around our house. I sometimes reduce the cayenne by about half depending on who is eating with me. We collect hot sauces in our house and have used a few different ones in this recipe. My favorite was a pineapple/habenero sauce. Tangy!AnonymousLos Angeles10/12/2020Amazing flavor. Made this a few weeks ago,\nSuch a big hit the family requested this tonight. Thanks Chris!AnonymousWorcester,ma7/23/2020I made this with chicken, obviously amazing. I used the crunchy bits of Romain and it was worth it. Well done Chris. However I made the sauce for my burgers with pepper jack cheese- also amazing! MrsKC03KC 7/7/2020Incredible. 10/10. Will be making again in the future. Made it exactly how is, except for I substituted the sauce for a mayo, ketchup, sriracha sauce. New favorite chicken recipe for sure!AnonymousChicago, IL6/1/2020Super tasty! AnonymousBk, Ny5/30/2020Made this with college age grandson, his recipe find:)  We both thought it was amazing, even with the absurd amount of heat!  It just works, the iceberg lettuce, the creamy sauce and white bread.  Made exactly as written and wouldn't change anything.  Thanks for another great recipe and video.LschmidtSt. Paul, Mn5/7/2020These were an ABSOLUTE DREAM. I can't remember the last time I bought iceberg lettuce but it's such a balancing factor for the heat, as is the milk bread. In Love.Jenna VarmegaWA&WV5/4/2020Quite pleased. My wife is not as picante tolerant as I am, and she didn't think it was too hot. A success. An addition to my dinner rotation.bdwootCoastal Oregon5/4/2020Just made these sandwiches tonight, however the only substitute I made was using pork instead of chicken. It\u2019s just what I had one hand but HOLY. CRAP. I do not regret the sub at all. This recipe has the perfect amount of spice. The sauce is awesome. The combination of soft and crunchy textures is great. Will absolutely make again, and will try chicken next time. Definitely recommend trying this out with pork.
