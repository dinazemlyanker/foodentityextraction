The flavor and texture of the tostones is most perfect immediately after they're pulled from the hot oil, but you can hold them in a warm oven if absolutely necessary (as with French fries, the reheated version may not dazzle). The sauce, on the other hand, can be made hours or a day ahead of time to no ill effect.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Coarsely chop leaves and stems\u2014you should have about 1 loosely packed cup. Trim roots and top inch of green parts of 4 scallions; discard. Cut scallions into 1\" pieces. Cut \u00bd habanero chile in half lengthwise and remove seeds from one half (or leave them in, if you don\u2019t mind extra heat).Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 2Transfer cilantro, scallions, and chile to a blender. Squeeze in juice from 2 limes; add 2 Tbsp. water. Season with a big pinch of salt. Blend on medium speed until cilantro and scallions are finely chopped, about 15 seconds.Step 3Add 1 cup sour cream or Greek yogurt and blend on high speed, scraping down sides as needed, until sauce is pale green and frothy, about 1 minute. Pour into a serving bowl and chill while you fry the plantains (or cover and chill sauce up to 1 day).Step 4Pour vegetable oil into a large (10\") cast-iron skillet, Dutch oven, or other large heavy pot to a depth of \u00bd\". Heat over medium-high until an instant-read thermometer registers 375\u00b0, 7\u20138 minutes.Step 5Meanwhile, prep the plantains: Trim off both ends of plantain. Using the tip of your knife, score skin of plantain lengthwise down its ribs, rotating and repeating until you\u2019ve scored the plantain all the way around. Make sure your cut extends down to the flesh of the plantain, but try not to cut into the flesh itself. Peel plantain along your score marks, then cut crosswise into \u00bd\u201d-thick coins.Step 6Line a rimmed baking sheet with a wire rack, or with a double layer of earth-friendly paper towels. Working in 2 batches, fry plantains, turning occasionally to ensure they don\u2019t stick to each other or to the pan, until golden and starting to crisp, about 2 minutes.Step 7Using a fish spatula or slotted spoon, transfer plantains to prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining plantains.Step 8Reduce heat to low to keep oil warm while you flatten the plantains. Using a meat mallet or a flat-bottomed dry measuring cup and working one by one, place plantain on cutting board and firmly press down on plantains to flatten them to less than \u00bc\" thick; the edges should split and become craggy. (Do this while the plantains are still warm; otherwise, they become annoyingly difficult to flatten.)Step 9Reheat oil to 375\u00b0. Working in 3 batches, fry flattened plantains, turning occasionally and letting oil return to 375\u00b0 between batches, until dark golden brown and crisp, about 3 minutes. Transfer to prepared baking sheet; season immediately with salt (it sticks better when the tostones are hot!).Step 10Transfer plantains to a platter. Serve with green sauce alongside for dipping.Step 11Do Ahead: Plantains can be fried 30 minutes ahead. Transfer to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and place in a 250\u00b0 oven to keep warm.How would you rate Tostones With Creamy Green Sauce?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (5)Back to TopTriangleCesaera and Divacooks are 200% correct on their tips. For 1/2\" in coins you do not need to deep fry. Also cutting down on the habanero size would make the salsa verde compliment better. From my fair share of bronx dominican tostones, it should be more sour/acidic than spicy. Mayochup/spicy mayo also works wonderfully as a condiment. Even in the winter these remind me of pre-quarantine summer days in the city. Thank you!LilyBronx, NY2/2/2021I make tostones all of the time for my team building company and can offer some tips.  Green plantains can be very tough to peel and can stain your fingers.  Use gloves and make sure the plantains are at room temperature.  If they are really tough to peel, put  them into a bowl and pour boiling water over them.  In a few minutes, take them out and you\u2019ll find the skins will come off easily.  Make sure when you fry them the first time they are golden brown, if they are not cooked enough, they will fall apart when smashing.  Also, half a raw habanero seems like a LOT of heat for one cup of dip.  I would go easy and add start with a 1/4 habanero to the blender and taste. Chilies are all different, some are hotter than others even if they are the same type. You could also use jalape\u00f1o or serrano chilies for flavor but less heat.  divacooksMiami1/9/2020You don\u2019t need to deep fry. You can use less oil- but enough to come halfway up their sides- and flip them once golden( they even get a more rich yellow). After you fry them once and smash them dip in a salty warm water and pressed garlic solution Before frying again. Mmmmmm. Traditional Dominican and Puerto Rican preparation. cesaeraUpstate NY1/6/2020Tostones are amazing. They're also great with garili aioli with cilantro.AnonymousNew York12/30/2019This was so fun! I've never made anything like this but your instructions made it easy! I didn't have plantains but grapefruit and ketchup were equally delicious.
