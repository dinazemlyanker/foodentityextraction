Next up, Sarah Jampel writes of her love for Medjool dates from Rancho Meladuco.When I was about 30 weeks pregnant, I ordered six pounds of Rancho Meladuco Medjool dates and diligently ate two a day. My husband thought this was because I was trying to induce or shorten labor\u2014some say there\u2019s a connection between date consumption and a faster, easier labor (others say that more research is needed). But any correlation was, for me, just a farce. See, the best part of pregnancy\u2014second only to the part about the power of the human body yadda yadda yadda\u2014was having the ultimate reason to eat as many dates as my heart desired under the guise of \u201cfunctional food.\u201dPhotograph by Isa Zapata. \u00a0Prop Styling by Paige HicksRancho Meladuco Signature Medjool Dates$20 at Williams Sonoma (1 lb box)$38 at Williams Sonoma (2 lb box)And the Rancho Meladuco Medjool dates, grown in California\u2019s Coachella Valley, are the best I can get my paws on here on the East Coast. They\u2019re ridiculously plump and sticky-sweet, like the best dark brown sugar, and their texture is so soft and luscious, it\u2019s almost fudgy. I store them in their cardboard boxes in my fridge, where they keep for months and solidify slightly, resulting in an even more satisfying chew. I don\u2019t blend them into shakes or pur\u00e9e them for sticky bun filling. (Rancho Meladuco actually sells imperfect \u201cgrinders\u201d intended for these situations.) Instead, the best dates are, in my mind, meant to be savored slowly, devoured on their own, admired glorious and whole. For a few lucky visitors to our apartment, I\u2019ll offer them as a gesture of extremely generous hospitality. Occasionally, I\u2019ll make what former food director Carla Lalli Music calls an energy sandwich, removing the date pit and stuffing the cavity with peanut butter (or drippy tahini or tahini plus chocolate chips). Even rarer, I\u2019ll put the dates to work in a salad with celery and feta or, if I\u2019m feeling really luxe, sizzle a handful in a skillet with olive oil, crushed red pepper flakes, and thyme, then spoon them\u2014crispy and caramelized\u2014over a bed of yogurt and scoop it all up with pita.These days the baby is here, but I\u2019m still on my two-a-day date fix. Often, I\u2019ll watch my husband eat three or four in one sitting after dinner. In my mind, I\u2019m calculating when I need to make the next Rancho Meladuco order and wondering, \u201cHey, what\u2019s your excuse?\u201d But I know that with dates this delicious, there\u2019s no real reason necessary.Date night:Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make.
