It\u2019s impossible to get a reservation and even attempting to walk-in with a party of two during a rainstorm at 6 p.m. is dicey. Snagging a solo bar seat tends to be a path of lesser resistance (though you still might have to wait), and the bar is an absolute delightful place to drown your Monday blues. The bartenders make a mean sbagliato and the complimentary bread with peppery Tuscan olive oil is burn-your-throat good.It\u2019s highly likely I\u2019m going to order pasta, especially the pappardelle al limone, which is unapologetically both lemony and buttery, resulting in an initially bracing bite that slowly mellows out. But the lasagna carciofi is also formidable in its subtlety\u2014thin layers of pasta, bechamel, and artichoke that are there for you when the day didn\u2019t go your way.If pasta isn\u2019t calling for me (a rare occasion), I Sodi is one of the few places I actually look forward to salad, whether it\u2019s the arugula with castelmagno cheese or the valeriana, made with m\u00e2che, pecorino, and balsamic. These are simple creations, made with excellent ingredients that embody chef Rita Sodi\u2019s honed-in Tuscan cooking.It\u2019s cooking so good that it serves as a carb-heavy therapy session. I\u2019ve gone there when I\u2019ve felt a little \u201cmeh\u201d and when I\u2019ve been incredibly close to ugly crying over my pasta because my day was that awful. But then I start eating, and I leave feeling a little better\u2026 even if I did have to wait an hour to simply be alone with my thoughts and a bowl of pasta.Go there: I SodiExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendNew YorkItalianRestaurantsRecipes you want to make.
