But I was sold the moment I saw this new recipe for a yellow tomato Bloody Mary, which calls for \u201cbruised tomatoes.\u201dI consider myself a Bloody Mary enthusiast, given that I grew up in a state known for topping its brunch cocktails with mini burgers (Wisconsin\u2014I\u2019m from Wisconsin). I will never say no to a piquant Bloody Mary and I most certainly won\u2019t say no to the opportunity to save some bruised and ugly\u2014though perfectly delicious!\u2014tomatoes from whatever happens to them post-farmers\u2019 market. This recipe was created by Molly Baz for exactly that reason, a way to use up a bag of peak season, ripe, though slightly flawed tomatoes that others pass over for more aesthetically pleasing options. But not us, we\u2019re turning them into a super quick Bloody Mary, blended together in like five minutes, I swear. Here\u2019s how it goes down.After rescuing a few outcast yellow tomatoes\u2014they\u2019re a tad sweeter than the red tomatoes you may be used to, but make sure they\u2019re super ripe, i.e. soft and juicy feeling\u2014I gathered up the remaining ingredients: celery, lemon juice (and a lemon!), red pepper flakes, olive brine, gin, salt, sugar, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, and horseradish. (Does it say something about me that I already had most of these in my kitchen? Probably.)Ugly tomatoes, we see you and we love you. Here\u2019s another genius way to use them.\nAlex LauI had to clean my blender of the leftover hummus clinging to the inside and to be honest, that was probably the longest step of this whole process. I grabbed those tomatoes and the chopped celery and tossed them into my weird Blendtec blender, which literally asks if I want to tweet about my blending experience on its futuristic screen. No, blender, I do not.When the celery-tomato mix was blended smooth, I strained it into a big pitcher. It was the color of the kind of sunrise you\u2019d post on Instagram\u2014sunshine-y yellow with a tinge of orange. Once I was happy with my pitcher situation, a particularly minimal glass-and-cork situation by IKEA, (I have three pitchers, this was a style decision, people), it was just a matter of whisking in the olive brine, hot sauce, lemon juice, sugar, Worcestershire sauce, horseradish, and salt. This is the part where you take a quick taste and adjust accordingly (mine needed more salt and a dash of hot sauce).At this point, I chilled everything for an hour to let the flavors meld, so if you\u2019re making this for a crowd, allow for that cushion of time. Smart brunch hosts would do this the night before for even more punch.A note on serving: I have always wanted to know how to make spicy salt rim. It\u2019s one of those things I\u2019ve watched bartenders do but never quite figured out myself. What\u2019s their secret?  Well good news, this recipe calls for a homemade spicy salt mix, so my life\u2019s biggest question has been answered. I mixed black pepper, red pepper flakes, and a teaspoon of salt into a bowl. From there, I rubbed the rim of two glasses with a lemon wedge (to help the salt stick), and filled the glasses with ice. After pouring in the gin\u20141.5 ounces as recommended, or a little more if it\u2019s a weekend\u2014I topped the booze with my Bloody Mary mix and personalized my garnishes: cherry tomatoes and olives, no celery because I really don\u2019t like it raw, a spicy pickle, and a single cheese curd. It\u2019s no mini burger, but it would sure make my parents proud.Get the recipe:Yellow Tomato Bloody MaryA bright golden Bloody Mary made with bruised (but still juicy wonderful!) farmers\u2019 market tomatoes.View RecipeMolly knows best:Recipes you want to make.
