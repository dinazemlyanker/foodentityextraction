If so, what\u2019s the best temp/time for reheating?AnonymousCalifornia 10/5/2020I loved the idea of this, but it was underwhelming. For fresh summer strawberries, the flavor of this was just \u201cokay.\u201d I would definitely cut the lemon juice in half or omit - it was super sour for us. The ratio of cornstarch was off too as we had a mostly thin liquid/juice. Also, the texture of the crumble was fine but not ideal - the coconut made it a bit grainy. We\u2019ll stick to our favorite strawberry crisp recipe (from erinliveswhole) which has similar ingredients but much better flavor and texture.  Anonymous8/2/2020literally my favorite thing ever.. i've made it twice already. the granola comes to such a perfect consistency.. the first time i made it i halved the recipe and used a smaller glass dish and ate the whole thing hot. i see people asking about making with frozen strawberries-- if you have no other choice, i would thaw them before using. baking frozen strawberries will probably make a lot of water and mess up the whole texture.  would not recommend.livgrassonew jersey, usa6/20/2020During quarantine, I cannot get fresh strawberries. Any thoughts on using frozen berries? I assume to roast them frozen. Thanks for any suggestions! AnonymousSolana Beach4/22/2020Another hit from Ms. Perelman. The juices are a perfect syrupy consistency due to the cornstarch. Had it with ice cream last night and yogurt this morning! I will try 1 tablespoon of lemon juice next time. The olive oil really adds a savory dimension to the flavor that is delicious. AnonymousCamino, CA5/20/2019I made this for Mother's Day Brunch -  couldn't stop eating it.  I actually cheated and used Bare Naked Maple Granola  --  I ate it with yogurt and again for dessert with ice cream.  A surprise success.  Every one really liked it - including grand kidsdhill7984Norman Oklahoma5/14/2019It's ridiculous how delicious this is. Made this as a hostess gift and then seriously rethought giving it once I'd tasted it, aka: sneaked a taste to be sure it was gift worthy. IT IS AND NOW I HAVE TO GIVE IT AWAY or the universe will come crashing down on me. My only hope is that she decides to serve it while I'm there, rather than waiting to have it for her breakfast in the morning. However it plays out, I have more strawbs in the fridge and I will be making this again immediately. AnonymousTexas5/10/2019I was able to mix the strawberry mixture in the pie dish I baked it in, so this came together with just one bowl! I subbed raw honey in for maple syrup, because that's what I had on hand. I had some down time before going in to work and made this as an afternoon snack! Super quick, easy, and delicious.
