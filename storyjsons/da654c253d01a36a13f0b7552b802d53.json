We ate out of styrofoam containers in gas station parking lots and visited strip clubs at 3 p.m. We fought over wilted celery. At one point somebody made a bracelet out of chicken bones. Things got weird. But we emerged triumphant, with a crumpled, sauce-stained spreadsheet listing the names of Atlanta\u2019s top 12 chicken wing purveyors, ranked.As a result of this experience, coupled with my decade in Atlanta (America\u2019s chicken wing capital\u2014fight me), I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur. And like any good Atlantan, Paper Boi included, I know without a scrap of doubt in my heart that the best chicken wing flavor on earth is lemon-pepper wet.First, a lesson for the uninitiated. The difference between regular lemon-pepper chicken and the hallowed lemon-pepper wet is one thing: butter. Specifically, liquified butter that\u2019s poured over your freshly fried chicken in a blanket of greasy glory, balancing the zing of the lemon and bite of the pepper with pure fat. Sometimes, there\u2019s hot sauce in there too. But know this: A lemon-pepper wet wing is a little bite of heaven.But you know what\u2019s even better than a little bite of heaven? An entire chicken-sized hunk of heaven. And that is what my fellow Atlantan Bryan Furman of B\u2019s Cracklin\u2019 BBQ has introduced to you, good readers, with this grilled lemon-pepper chicken recipe. So obviously, I had to rep my adopted hometown and make it, even though I\u2019d never grilled a whole chicken before. And because I am an all-or-nothing kind of person and a glutton for punishment (and just a glutton, generally), I decided to make it about two hours before 40+ people were to arrive at my tiny-kitchened Brooklyn apartment over Memorial Day weekend. Go big and stay home. That\u2019s my motto.Get the whole cookout menu from B\u2019s Cracklin\u2019 here.\nPhoto by Peden + Munk, Food Styling by Sue Li, Prop Styling by Rebecca BartosheskyHow it went downStep one to cooking an entire chicken is buying an entire chicken. In keeping with Furman\u2019s M.O. of using only top quality proteins he helps raise himself, I opted for the most ethically-raised-seeming chicken in the Key Foods refrigerated meats aisle. I removed the chicken\u2019s heart and other ick parts like a champ (made easy by the fact that they came neatly tucked inside a little plastic bag) and tossed them in the freezer, telling my cat and whoever else might have been listening that I would someday \u201cmake a stock with them or something!\u201d while knowing that in reality they will remain lost behind three open bags of freezer-burned broccoli until I a) move out or b) die.My friend Pat arrived as I was cleansing the chicken carcass (not with soap; shout-out to this man for learning that lesson for me). In exchange for a can of Coors Light, he agreed to be my sous chef, which mostly involved taking videos of me with the chicken and posting them to my Instagram story.\u201cAyyyyyeeee!!!! \ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\udd25 \u201d responded pitmaster Bryan, upon seeing said story. \u201cCut it in halves. It gets the flavor better that way.\u201dDammit because I planned to skip this step, having no idea how to sever an entire chicken. But now I had to. The pitmaster was watching. \u201cHold down this chicken!\u201d I yelled to Pat, who\u2019d wandered away under the wrongful impression that he\u2019d come to his birthday barbecue to socialize. I grabbed the largest knife I could find with trembling hands. \u201cHold her down!\u201dFolks, what ensued was not pretty and more closely resembled a Shakespearean murder scene than a maybe commonplace culinary proceeding, but what\u2019s important is that I ended up with two pieces of chicken where once there was one.Now, the thing to know about this recipe is that once you get past the chopping a chicken in half part, it\u2019s really quite easy. Even if you\u2019re me. Sprinkle that baby with salt and pep, let it sit at room temp for an hour, heat honey and butter on the stove \u2018til it gets all foamy-delish, add some lemon slices, and throw both chicken halves on the grill. If you end up accidentally pouring the entire batch of honey butter onto the chicken in one go instead of brushing it on every five minutes like you\u2019re supposed to, fear not! Just melt more honey butter. There\u2019s no such thing as too much honey butter.And if your roommate decides to get involved at the LAST POSSIBLE SECOND and drops one of your beautiful golden brown chicken halves into the back of the gross dirty grill seconds before it was ready to be served, this too is not the end of the world. Just mold your face into a mask-smile, say \u201cno I\u2019m not mad\u201d through gritted teeth, and stick that thang back on the grill for a couple more minutes to burn off the grime. Don\u2019t tell any of your guests what happened. They\u2019ll read about it later on the internet.I may be a cooking noob, but I\u2019ve been described by myself and my mom as one of the most acclaimed lemon-pepper chicken judges this side of the Mason-Dixon. And the verdict is clear: Bryan Furman\u2019s lemon-pepper [wet] chicken checks all the boxes: juicy on the inside, crisp on the outside, flavored with a swoon-worthy balance of salt and pepper and sweet, sweet lemony butter. Best of all, its deceptively-easy-to-makeness will force everyone at your barbecue to realize they\u2019ve been underestimating you and your motor skills and your ability to be patient all their lives. Plus, you can spend the rest of the day week month bragging about it. Which I did. Which I\u2019m still doing.Y\u2019all, I grilled an entire chicken.And you can too!Lemon-Pepper ChickenA summer grilling recipe from B\u2019s Cracklin\u2019 BBQ in Georgia, where juicy lemon-pepper chicken is a culinary tradition.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titGrillChickenLemonAtlantaRecipes you want to make.
