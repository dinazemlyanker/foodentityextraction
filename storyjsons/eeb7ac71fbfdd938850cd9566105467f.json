Have a question? Email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.How much can you edit a photo of a sandwich? \u2014Tinkering TedOur social media team prefers barely a touch of editing to enhance the sandwich\u2019s natural beauty. But I think we\u2019ve double-tapped every sandwich out there at this point, right? Now we need ART. Amp that saturation till those folds of deli meats glisten. Tune up the warmth; I want to smell that toasted bun. Inch up the contrast until the lettuce has more definition than a dictionary. When it feels right, you\u2019ll know. Post.Is it okay to post something if it looked really, really good but didn\u2019t taste very good? \u2014Superficial SullivanYES. Once you accept that Instagram is a performance space, an app for entertainment, decide which role you will play. Selfie savant. Eater of food. Fitspo quad killer. Parent of a three-month-old who will soon be a four-month-old. Meme Lord. They\u2019re all unreliable narrators. Best to trust no one and nothing in general but especially on Instagram. Assume that any marble is vinyl contact paper. Suspect every pot pie of hiding something (ugh, turnips). Only then are you actually living in reality.Illustrations by Cari Vander YachtThe shot of an ice cream cone against a cool wall seems overplayed. What else can we shoot food in front of? \u2014Background BernardVery large cowsSomeone\u2019s air-drying bed sheetsAny novelty T-shirt but especially the tuxedo onesCheerleaders in full pyramidShiny elevator doorsA passing trainThe vast expanse of a human backIllustrations by Cari Vander YachtHow long can you make your friends wait to eat while you take the perfect shot? I hate myself at the time, but sometimes it takes a while. \u2014Self-loathing Layla1.5 minutes.Any advice for getting the perfect food shot? I only have 1.5 minutes! \u2014Blurry BenicioCrowd-sourced from people with WAY more followers than I:Get to a window or take it outside. Natural light above all.Overhead shots are the safest.Shoot on a neutral surface that isn\u2019t too dark (so we can see the food clearly).Take a bite of food to make it more \u201clived in.\u201dIf your silverware is reflecting you taking your photo, move it.Always keep Instagram\u2019s 4:5 ratio in mind, which really just means that you should shoot vertically.Add elements that give a sense of place or tell the story behind a dish (the grass you\u2019re picnicking on, Grandma\u2019s recipe card\u2026).Illustrations by Cari Vander YachtCan I post a photo of plain cottage cheese eaten straight from the container? That\u2019s what I ate today. \u2014Zealous ZahraLarge or small curd? Just curious. I think large is better. If it will make you happy, post it.Are you obligated to share a recipe if you post a delicious pic of something you cooked? \u2014Indifferent IraInstagram makes it cumbersome to share links for nonbusiness accounts, and even those are annoying (who likes the likeshop?). You should happily assume that if you cook something and share it, you\u2019re inspiring someone else out there in the universe to make it too. Cool! Make it easy on them. Give them the info they need to find it on Google or write \u201cGOOGLE \u2018super moist chocolate mocha cake\u2019 for the recipe!\u201d in the caption.Illustrations by Cari Vander YachtIs it rude to comment, \u201cThis looks gnarly, but I\u2019m sure it tastes GREAT!\u201d? \u2014Cheerful ChandlerOnce I posted a photo of a cherry pie with a cutout-hole crust pattern and was swarmed with angry commenters freaking out about their hole phobia being triggered. AAH LOOK AWAY, they screamed. GONNA FALL IN THE HOLE AND DIE, they all-capped. It\u2019s a real thing. It\u2019s called trypophobia. I thought the pie was beautiful!! I was kinda hurt, on behalf of the pie. People transfer their emotions to the food they cook, so when you call out the hideous plop of corn pudding on my plate, I\u2019m immediately concluding you think I live a hideous, ploppy life. And maybe I do! You\u2019ll certainly never find out from my Instagram! Save your criticism for the New York Review of Books and instead simply comment, \u201cThat looks delicious.\u201d Just do that. For the love of God, please just do that.Explore Bon App\u00e9titEtiquetteIs It Ever OkaySocial MediaRead MorecultureIs It Ever Okay\u2026to Bring a Single Serving to a Picnic?By Alex BeggscultureIs It Ever Okay...To Hide Special Treats from Your Roommates In Isolation?By Alex BeggscultureIs It Ever Okay...to Bring 11 Items to the 10 Items or Less Aisle?By Alex BeggscultureIs It Ever Okay...to Fake an Engagement for Free Dessert?By Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
