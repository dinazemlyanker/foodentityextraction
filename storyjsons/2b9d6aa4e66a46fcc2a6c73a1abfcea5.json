Pour it over ice and top it with seltzer for a refreshing alcohol-free pick-me-up, or stir a splash of rum into your serving for a cocktail.Ingredients10\u201312 servings4limes7navel oranges, divided2small jalape\u00f1os, divided1cup sugar\u00bdtsp. kosher salt12oz. white rum (optional)Club soda (for serving)PreparationStep 1Juice limes and 6 oranges into a large pitcher. (You should have about \u00be cup lime juice and 1\u00bc cups orange juice.) Discard lime rinds and half of the orange rinds. Cut remaining orange rinds into quarters and place in a large saucepan.Step 2Coarsely chop 1 jalape\u00f1o and add to orange rinds along with sugar and salt.

Stir in 1 cup warm water and let sit at least 10 minutes and up to 1 hour.Step 3Strain orange mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into pitcher with juice, gently pressing with a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids. Thinly slice remaining orange and add to pitcher. Remove seeds from remaining jalape\u00f1o; thinly slice into rounds and add to pitcher.Step 4To serve, pour 2 oz. juice mixture and 1 oz. rum, if using, into an ice-filled glass. Top off with club soda; stir to combine.Step 5Do Ahead: Juice mixture can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill.How would you rate Spicy Citrus Refresher?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (3)Back to TopTriangleLove this recipe! I think it could be spicier, but that's personal preference; tastes great as the recipe is! I like to use a combo of navel oranges and blood oranges, and I'll make a big batch of the juice on the weekend and have easy, quick cocktails all week long! Doesn't take long to throw together and for me it's definitely worth it.AnonymousWaco, Tx5/23/2021I absolutely love this recipe! It is the perfect combo of refreshing, sweet, and spicy. It is a bit time consuming for a cocktail, but it's a great cocktail to make when you have more time (for example, during a quarantine!). I added lime seltzer instead of club soda, and salted the rim of my glass.BrynnMac18Philadelphia3/25/2020I was somewhat unimpressed with this. It was a lot of work but didn\u2019t taste like anything special. In my opinion the same thing probably could have been achieved by muddling a few jalape\u00f1os slices in sugar and then adding some OJ and lime juice. Definitely didn\u2019t need the seltzer, either. We found the tequila worked well too if you don\u2019t like rum.
