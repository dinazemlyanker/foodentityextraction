These days, I take field trips to Sturbridge to eat at B.T.'s Smokehouse, an unassuming roadside restaurant serving some of the best barbecue I've ever eaten, despite being in a region that\u2019s, well, not known for barbecue.Situated between I-84 and I-90, B.T.\u2019s is an ideal pit stop for any drive that takes you up to (or down from) Boston, New Hampshire, or Maine. Brisket is the thing here\u2014smoked for 24 to 30 hours on local apple and hickory wood. You can order it \u00e0 la carte, in a Reuben-style sandwich, or\u2014my favorite\u2014on a platter with classic sides like collard greens and mac and cheese.While it may be unassuming, B.T.\u2019s is hardly undiscovered. The lines get long, so time your trip to hit the smokehouse when it opens at 11 a.m. or during the late-afternoon lull. Order your meat to go, grab a beer at the convenience store next door, and park yourself on the hood of your car, the curb, or anywhere you can find a spot. It isn\u2019t glamorous, but it is astonishingly good.Go there: B.T.\u2019s SmokehouseExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsBarbecueNew EnglandRecipes you want to make.
