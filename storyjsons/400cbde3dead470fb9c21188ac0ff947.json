Shrimp with a garlicky, pungent, buttery scampi sauce. The combination of garlic and ramps may seem like overkill, but we promise it\u2019s not. The garlic will mellow as it cooks while the ramps stay pungent. We tried it without the garlic and it just wasn\u2019t as good. Sometimes more is more.Ingredients4 servings3Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling1bunch ramps (about 6 oz.), bulbs and greens separated, bulbs halved lengthwise, greens torn into 2\"\u20133\" pieces3garlic cloves, thinly sliced\u00bdtsp. mild red pepper flakes (such as Maras, Urfa, or Aleppo-style), plus more for serving\u00bdcup dry white wine1\u00bclb. large shrimp, peeled, deveined, preferably tails left on4Tbsp. unsalted butterKosher salt\u00bdlemonPreparationStep 1Combine 3 Tbsp. oil and ramp bulbs in a large skillet.

Ramps grow wild, and when gathered, take 5-7 years to regrow, so they are considered a threatened or endangered  plant and Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s prohibition is to protect them.AnonymousCanada1/26/2022Can\u2019t make this as I believe it is illegal to sell ramps in Quebec.  I\u2019m not sure if you are allowed to dig them up if you find them.  Why????\nSandi KramerMontreal, Quebec Canada3/17/2021This was fantastic. I don't think I will ever make scampi again without ramps. I too doubled the recipe, since I'm lucky enough to live somewhere where I can go dig as many as I want for free.\nFor the person from Australia, I bet they would grow there, however, there really is no substitute that I know of - the flavor is that unique. Perhaps you could get someone to send you seeds or bulbs. They do take a *long* time to mature, but they are an easy, set it and forget it kind of plant.SarafinaThe hills of PA5/17/2020This is delicious! Doubled the ramps and would definitely recommend you do so too. Definitely one of the best things I've made in quarantine and I've been no stranger to Bon App\u00e9tit! AnonymousBoston, MA5/3/2020Quick and delicious dinner! I was lucky enough to get five bunches of ramps at the farmers market and this was the first recipe I made. The Aleppo pepper was a nice touch especially since I almost always use Calabrian chili flakes.AnonymousNew York4/29/2020Good god this way delicious. I was just lamenting the fact that I wouldn\u2019t be able to have a single ramp dish this year because of the quarantine, but then a local hero started selling some out of his driveway after a foraging trip to North Carolina.\n\nI\u2019d recommend serving this with focaccia or another dipping vessel to sop up the delicious sauce.lauren trudellBirmingham, AL4/27/2020Ramps are not a thing we have in Australia \u2013\u00a0I'd never heard of it before and after some googling it seems they only grow in North America / Canada! This sounds delish though \u2013\u00a0what could I substitute ramps for?LaraCBMelbourne, Australia4/14/2020So good! I made it with two bunches of ramps because I'm LIVIN' LARGE. Then I tossed with spaghetti, for the same reason. alexbeggsBon App\u00e9tit 4/8/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titShrimpShellfishSeafoodRampsOnionVegetableGarlicSpringQuickEasyWeeknight MealsOne-Pot MealsMainGluten-FreeHealthyishSaut\u00e9DinnerRecipes you want to make.
