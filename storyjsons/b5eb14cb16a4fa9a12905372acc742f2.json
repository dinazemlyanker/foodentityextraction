There are the ones that really sting, sure, but more often than not they just show how much we know about each other and our specific idiosyncrasies. For example: These days, whenever I make fun of something my sisters are eating, someone slings back, \u201cWell, all you do is eat kimchi!\u201d Which is, well, actually pretty true, and I'm not mad about it at all. Especially when \"eating kimchi\" means \"eating kimchi pancakes,\" my new favorite go-to breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snack.Here's the thing about me and kimchi. When I see headlines for something called \u201cpantry pasta\u201d or \u201cclean-out-the-fridge-frittata\" or any other dish that promises to make use of the ingredients I always have around, my thoughts immediately turn to the huge jars of kimchi that are pretty much ever-present in my fridge. And while my favorite ferment doesn't necessarily fit into those catch-all dishes, it always belongs in my beloved kimchi pancakes.They're beyond easy to make. The actual pancake batter is all of five ingredients, which I really, seriously always have in my house. (Soy sauce! All-purpose flour! Eggs! Kimchi! Scallions!) And it comes together super quick. Like, I-make-these-for-breakfast-on-a-weekday quick.Chopping squishy-crunchy kimchi is extremely satisfying.\nPhoto by Alex LauSo all you do is combine the soy sauce, water, brine from the jar of kimchi, and an egg in a bowl. Then you whisk in some AP flour until things look smooth and fold in that sweet, sweet chopped-up kimchi and four sliced scallions. You heat up some oil in a pan the same way you would for sweet breakfast pancakes, and when it's hot dollop in heaping spoonfuls of your batter\u2014I prefer them to be on the smaller side because it makes flipping them more manageable. (Yes, I\u2019m a 25 year old adult who works at a food magazine and isn\u2019t afraid to admit she\u2019s scared to flip pancakes.) Once you\u2019ve made all of your pancakes (there should be 8 lil guys!), you stir some rice vinegar and soy sauce together in a bowl to make a salty-tangy dipping sauce. And that's all folks!Make them in the morning if you\u2019re a savory breakfast lover like me. Serve them with a stir-fry for dinner. Or whip up a batch whenever you're home, think there's nothing to eat, and remember the beautiful jar of kimchi waiting around to make your day. And be sure to dig up all of the embarrassing pictures of your siblings wearing underbite-corrective headgear. You know, for emergencies.Make them! Make them! Make them!Quick Kimchi PancakesChewy. Crunchy. Salty. Spicy. These veggie-packed fritters have it all.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titNever FailKimchiPancakeRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
