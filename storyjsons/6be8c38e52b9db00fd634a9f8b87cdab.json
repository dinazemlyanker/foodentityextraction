For more of Pinkerton\u2019s genius, check out the downstairs space, her diner-esque Theorita.THE VIBE IS: laid-back and warm, despite the constant crowds. You don\u2019t need to flag down a bartender at the two-people-deep bar; they\u2019ll find you. And once inside the converted auto garage, you\u2019ll spy families and groups of friends all out for a big night, sharing pizzas, pastas, and stories.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Tuesday to Thursday, 5:30 p.m. to 11 p.m., and Friday and Saturday, 5:30 p.m. to midnight.Photo by Alex LauPhoto by Alex LauPhoto by Alex LauWE ALSO LOVEZuni Caf\u00e9The iconic Hayes Valley bistro that's world-famous for a reasonThe ProgressThe husband-and-wife team behind State Bird Provisions reimagines the family-style dinner party in San Francisco.Tartine ManufactoryThe megabakery-slash-wine-bar-slash-ice-cream-shop-slash-restaurantExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
