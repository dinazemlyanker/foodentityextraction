He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.You know how you think your mom\u2019s recipe for fill-in-the-blank is the absolute best recipe for fill-in-the-blank ever?Well, yeah, so did I. At least until I presented Maxine Rapoport\u2019s famous pumpkin chiffon pie for a tasting in the BA Test Kitchen.Typically when you serve people pie, the responses range from \u201cThank you so much!\u201d to \u201cOh my God, this is SO good.\u201d They\u2019re, you know, happy that someone actually made a pie and is serving them a slice.Want this letter before it hits the website?

Tastes kinda flat as is.\u201dAnd so it went. What I thought was an infallible dessert\u2014a favorite of every Rapoport-hosted Thanksgiving\u2014turned out to be as vulnerable to tweaks and revisions as every recipe that makes its way through BA\u2019s strict development process.In its platonic form, Maxine\u2019s pumpkin chiffon pie consists of a creamy, fluffy mousse, speckled with tiny air bubbles, redolent of just enough nutmeg and cinnamon.If a conventional pumpkin pie is dense and heavy, this one practically levitates, it\u2019s so light. And instead of a traditional\u2014read: soggy\u2014pie crust, this one has a super simple buttery graham cracker crust.At least, that\u2019s how I remembered the pie. Until I had to appraise it with a critical eye. Carla was right\u2014it was too sweet. So we reduced the sugar in the pumpkin custard from \u2154 cup to a scant \u00bd cup. And the whipped egg whites, which provide the mousse with its airy nature, needed less than the \u00bc cup of sugar originally called for.Because the mousse is a no-cook concoction, my mom always just blended the graham cracker crumbs with melted butter and a smidge of sugar and salt. Turns out that parbaking the crust for about 20 minutes evokes a toasty, nutty flavor while extracting unwanted moisture.And have you ever blended a bit of sour cream or Greek yogurt into freshly whipped cream? I will from now on. What used to be just creamy is now tangy and complex.Oh, and there was a whole bit on my mom\u2019s hand-written recipe index card where my she prescribes freezing the pie over night. I think because this would allow you to make it days ahead of Thanksgiving. But we struggled to nail the defrosting time, and Carla described the not-quite-unfrozen pie as \u201cweeping,\u201d as its ice crystals melted.I\u2019m not going to insist that this pie is better than your mom\u2019s, but after the tweaks and adjustments we made, I am going to go ahead and say that it is better than my mom\u2019s.
