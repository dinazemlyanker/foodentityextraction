Now, before your head goes to all sorts of places it shouldn\u2019t go, I will come right out it and say it: I made a dessert that didn\u2019t involve plums. Or peaches. Or nectarines. Or berries. Nope, it involved chocolate. I\u2019m sorry! But actually, I\u2019m not sorry, because this Chocolate Budino with Candied Walnuts was truly delectable, light and rich, all at once.The dessert (budino is Italian for pudding, FYI) was devised by Angela Pinkerton, pastry chef at the Hot 10 winner Che Fico in San Francisco and streamlined for the home cook by the test kitchen\u2019s Chris Morocco. It\u2019s a bit of a project, though by no means an insurmountable one. The upside is that it tastes and looks like a restaurant dessert, too\u2014so elegant, your guests will be oohing and ahhing and wondering if they\u2019ll ever go out to eat again when instead they can just come over to your apartment.If you want to spend some quality time in the kitchen, you can absolutely do this all in one day. But if you don\u2019t have the time, or you feel like splitting up the work into more approachable parts, make the candied walnuts ahead. As long as a week ahead! They\u2019ll stay good...if you don\u2019t eat them all before you get to the budino.Feel free to serve with gelato.\nPhoto by Alex LauNow about that budino. What makes this recipe so heavenly is its silky-smooth texture. This happens from the combination of chocolate, cream, sugar, and eggs. The eggs thicken the chocolate and cream on the stove, where the flame cooks the eggs just enough so that they create a perfect consistency. Overcook them, though, and your custard will turn lumpy.For this reason, it helps to have a candy thermometer (Morocco endorses this one). You can, in fact, wing it without, but having something to read the exact temperature will ease any doubts (you don\u2019t want it to go over 180\u00b0)\u2014or at least it did mine. If you decide to go the wild path, pay close attention and watch for the moment when the custard is thick enough to coat a spoon.Before letting the budino cool and firm up in the fridge, you add a small amount of olive oil, preferably Olio Verde for its decided grassiness, and salt. Suddenly the dessert goes from just plain sweet to something earthier and more complex.And as if that weren\u2019t enough, the final presentation takes it even more beyond. The chilled budino gets topped with the sugared, golden-brown nuts that you definitely didn\u2019t eat, a drizzle more of that olive oil, a sprinkling of flaky salt, and\u2014wait for it\u2014a turn or two of freshly ground black pepper to really push the savory notes, the subtlest hint of spice hitting your tastebuds before the sweet. Suddenly what you have in front of you is layered and nuanced, as if luscious chocolate budino wouldn\u2019t be enough on its own.Get the recipe:Chocolate Budino with Candied WalnutsThis deliciously wobbly pudding is made with chocolate, milk, cream, and eggs and spiked with olive oil and salt.
