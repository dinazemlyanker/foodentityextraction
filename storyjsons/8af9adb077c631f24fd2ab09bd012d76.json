Order now and you\u2019ll qualify for free shipping! Cindy Crawford founded Meaningful Beauty, Lindsay Ellingson created Wander Beauty, and Tyra Banks developed Tyra Beauty, as Tyra would.But Miranda Kerr was one of the first to go green back in 2009 with KORA Organics, a line that offered organic skincare before clean beauty earned its own seal in Sephora (which, by the way, KORA Organics now sports). This summer, she added a turmeric mask to the lineup, and I was intrigued. Turmeric is one of those skincare ingredients that hasn\u2019t broken into the mainstream the same way probiotics and argan oil have, even though it\u2019s been used for centuries by brides in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to give skin a prenuptial glow.KORA Organics 2-in-1 Turmeric Brightening & Exfoliating Mask is all about it.  \u201cI essentially wanted a product that delivered a post-facial glow that can be done at home or when traveling in one simple step and in under 10 minutes,\u201d Kerr tells me. \u201cBut it\u2019s still gentle enough for use on sensitive skin.\u201d According to the brand, the spice\u2014which is known as much for its golden color as its healing properties\u2014does everything but plan your wedding. It calms inflammation, reduces redness, soothes sensitive skin, and minimizes the appearance of dark spots, leaving you with brighter, more even skin. Those are some pretty lofty claims, so I wanted to put it to the test.Upon my first use, I\u2019m relieved to find that the mask, which feels and looks like a thick scrub, does not smell anything like turmeric. No offense to turmeric proselytizers, but I used to ruin green smoothies with a heaping teaspoon of the stuff back when I believed that it really had anti-tumor properties. (I no longer buy into this, seeing as I\u2019ve been diagnosed with a rare liver cancer three times.) In fact, it smells minty and herbaceous. And it\u2019s not yellow but an unfortunate brown color best described by my boyfriend kindly asking: \u201cDid you fall into a toilet?\u201dThe granules keep it from going on evenly. I can\u2019t tell exactly which ingredient gives it that grit, but the parade of powders\u2014rosehip seed, arrowroot root, camellia leaf, noni fruit, and bamboo\u2014on the list make me think it\u2019s probably that combo. But, unlike a scrub, this mask dries and did so well enough that I forgot about it and left it on for a half hour. (The recommended timeframe is five to 15 minutes). But there was zero irritation or dryness. And while I did feel a slight tingling at first, which I\u2019m guessing is from the papaya enzymes dissolving my dead skin cells, it subsided within a few minutes without ever getting close to stinging or burning.While rinsing it off, I began to massage it into my skin. If you have sensitive skin, you should probably avoid doing this, as you\u2019re then getting double the exfoliation from both 1) the enzymes and 2) the granules, which can be harsh and potentially exacerbate sensitivity. My skin is like rhino hide, and even I had to switch to splashing water on my face. Save the scrubbing for when you\u2019re using it only as an exfoliator, which, to be fair, is its second purpose\u2014hence the 2-in-1 in its name.My skin definitely looked brighter and felt softer after that one use, although it didn\u2019t do a damn thing for the clogged pores on my forehead, which result from stress and manifest as little bumps. But I noticed that some post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation on my skin, a.k.a. the dark spots that always follow a zit on my deep-olive skin tone, seemed lighter and less noticeable. Within two uses of the mask, they went from requiring an extra dab of concealer to disappearing seamlessly under my tinted SPF.Turmeric might really be the real deal. I\u2019m sold\u2014plus, it\u2019s far less drying and stripping than the clay masks I used to slather on in high school. If anything, this mask serves as a nice break from the more intensive exfoliating acids I use on a regular basis, as long as I don\u2019t scrub it in when I rinse.And, okay, while I haven\u2019t yet transformed into a giraffe-like goddess, the smoother, brighter skin is good enough for now.Explore Bon App\u00e9titOrganicTrendsHealthyishNatural BeautyShoppingRead MoreLifestyleHerbivore Prism Is the First Natural Exfoliator I've Tried That Really WorksBy Deanna PaiRecipes you want to make.
