He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.By the time you\u2019re reading this, Labor Day weekend will have sputtered to a close, and I\u2019ll have hit Full Tomato. Absolute Corn, too. Basil, see you next year.Whether or not fall is actually in the air, I\u2019m ready to flip the page on the calendar. Spareribs on the grill give way to short ribs in the oven. Sun Gold\u2013tomato spaghetti segues into creamy mushroom pasta.At some point I\u2019ll inevitably pester my wife, Simone, about whether we can plan some sort of dinner party. \u201cI feel like we haven\u2019t had anyone over in ages!\u201d Because to me this time of year means the return of Cooking Season\u2014back to work, back to school, back to the kitchen.That\u2019s the ethos behind our September issue out now. We\u2019re sharing the kinds of recipes, game plans, and let\u2019s-do-this-thing! inspiration that will carry you through to the holidays. We\u2019ve moved the Hot 10, our celebration of America\u2019s Best New Restaurants, to the October issue, at which point you\u2019ll have spent so much time braising and roasting and chopping and mincing that you\u2019ll need a night out, yes?Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!If this creamy mushroom pasta isn\u2019t the picture of fall, I don\u2019t know what is.\nPhoto by Marcus Nilsson, Food Styling by Frances Boswell, Prop Styling by Amy WilsonBut for now, how about you step away from the grill and get reacquainted with your oven\u2014you know, that box that makes big hunks of meat and pulled-from-the-earth root vegetables all glazy and caramelized and impossibly fragrant? It\u2019s what Alison Roman turns to so deftly in her Steak House Night in America feature. Having attended a party a few years back in which Alison smoked out an entire apartment while individually searing off a half dozen dry-aged rib eyes, I\u2019m glad she\u2019s finally heeding the common-sense cooking advice that so many of us resist\u2014to make it easy on yourself while still making it delicious. In this case, she lets the oven go to work on a prime rib roast and a gang of baked potatoes, while a serve-yourself martini bar keeps her guests more than occupied.Our Fall Playbook answers all manner of other pressing concerns, like what to do when it\u2019s 6:26 p.m. on a Monday and you still don\u2019t know what\u2019s for dinner. And have you seen Carla Lalli Music\u2019s beautiful galettes? She argues that you should take advantage of all that ripe end-of-summer fruit to make the tastiest, most forgiving home-baked dessert there is.All told, these are the recipes and strategies that will make you forget all about your swimsuit and your long, lazy weekends. Because, really, starting right now, it\u2019s the best time of year.
