Leading a healthy lifestyle and focusing on a plant-based lifestyle can make a lasting impact not only on personal wellness but the very health of our planet, too.

Her favorite non-cooking moments? Making time to fit in a yoga class during a busy week to keep calm and centered.This Delicious Summer Salad Is Quick to Prepare and (of Course) Completely VeganChloe has worked tirelessly in her career to adapt people\u2019s mindset about plant-based and vegan eating.
