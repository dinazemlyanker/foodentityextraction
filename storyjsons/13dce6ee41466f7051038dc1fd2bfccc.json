Across the country it\u2019s draped across pizzas and stuffed into sandwiches, like New Orleans\u2019s iconic muffuletta and even a riff on the Japanese katsu sando. But mortadella, which sits pretty in pink in the deli case, isn\u2019t constrained only to the realm of the edible, it has emerged as the meat of the moment, immortalized on shirts, socks, caps, and even as a smiling, fleshy pool float from artist Katie Kimmel. You can drape your own smiling, fleshy self over it\u2014before toweling off with illustrator Marianna Fierro\u2019s flying mortadella towel, of course.\u201cThe people that love mortadella love mortadella,\u201d says Marc Hernandez, meat and cheese buyer at Formaggio Kitchen in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who counts it among his favorite deli meats. Mortadella is not only maintaining its popularity, he says, but he\u2019s been seeing it on more menus, from pizza shops to finer dining joints. \u201cPeople are coming around to it and realizing it\u2019s not just elevated baloney,\u201d he explains. \u201cEspecially when you get a good quality mortadella, nothing beats it.\u201dBut what is mortadella, actually?Mortadella is an emulsified large-format pork sausage. In non-butcher speak, that means that pork meat is finely minced into a smooth paste, put into a casing, and steamed until the whole thing is evenly and thoroughly cooked, Hernandez explains. Mortadella gets its speckled look as a result of fat, pistachios (often, but not always), and black peppercorns mixed in with the meat.Neck fat from the pig is ideal here, according to Hernandez, \u201cbecause it has a high melting point, so it\u2019s going to stay tender but not melt\u201d as the sausage cooks, giving mortadella its signature silky texture. Because of all that richness, people tend to prefer their mortadella sliced paper-thin, he adds.As for the etymology, according to one hypothesis, the word mortadella comes from the Latin word mortarium, or mortar, referring to the tool in which the meat is pounded. According to another, it\u2019s derived from the Latin term farcimen myrtatum, a sausage flavored with myrtle berries\u2014a common addition centuries ago, when peppercorns were less accessible. Since myrtle is known as mirto in Italian, mirto becomes mortadella, says Dino Borri, global vice president at Eataly.Where does mortadella come from?Italy, originally\u2014though American-made mortadella from purveyors like Tempesta Artisan Salumi and Olympia Provisions also exists. As a result of that jump, there\u2019s some confusion in the United States about mortadella, according to Borri. In Italy, \u201cthere is not just one mortadella\u201d but many, he says. They\u2019re usually made of 100% pork but with regional variations, he explains, comparing it to prosciutto, an umbrella term referring to a leg of pork that exists in varieties like prosciutto di Parma, prosciutto di San Daniele, and so on.Stateside, what we call mortadella is usually actually mortadella Bologna, Borri says, a variety that carries a protected geographical indication certifying that it was made within specific regions of Italy using particular standards. And though bologna (or as we know it in the U.S., baloney) shares a name with the Italian city, that sandwich meat is more of a North American creation; often attributed to German immigrants, it can be made with any kind of meat or a combination of meats.How do I know I\u2019m getting the good stuff? And what is \u201cthe good stuff\u201d anyway?You can tell by the mouthfeel, primarily. Borri seeks out meat that feels soft in the mouth and chews into a consistent texture, without defined pieces in each bite. \u201cYou want something smooth and silky in texture, very rich in flavor, and fatty,\u201d Hernandez explains. That\u2019s a sign of a more controlled method of cooking since \u201cif you cook at too high heat or too aggressive of a manner, you\u2019ll get more of a grainy texture.\u201d Ideally, you won\u2019t find those versions at the deli counter since producers should do quality checks, Borri says. In addition, mortadella should have a slight sweetness and a strong but pleasant smell.I got the goods! Now how do I serve it?In Bologna you\u2019ll often find it sandwiched between rolls, around lunchtime or 4 p.m., according to Borri. \u201cJust bread and mortadella is the most traditional,\u201d he says. Alternately, you can also find mortadella sliced into thicker cubes and eaten as is during aperitivo time. \u201cBoth ways are perfectly reasonable,\u201d Hernandez says, adding that if you\u2019re looking for the latter, ask for a thick slice of mortadella and then cut it up at home. Mortadella also makes a great addition to charcuterie boards, pasta (both as a filling and sizzled up as a salty add-in), and meatballs.We\u2019re big fans of mortadella at BA, though we admittedly don\u2019t always take the traditional route.
