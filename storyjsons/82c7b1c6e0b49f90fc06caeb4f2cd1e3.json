Too often, these humble legumes are overlooked in favor of crispy chickpeas and creamy cannellini beans. Lentils may not have glory, but they do have a few tricks up their sleeve. Their small stature means they cook much faster than beans, plus they can be repurposed in a wide range of weeknight meals without making you feel like you're eating the same old thing.We love all kinds of lentils, from red to green, but black lentils are in a league of their own. These glistening, bead-like beauties are basically the caviar of legumes\u2014they even look like it when cooked, which is why they\u2019re also called beluga lentils. Black lentils are beloved  because they only need to be boiled for about 20-30 minutes until they\u2019re tender yet toothsome, and they've got a thicker skin that helps them hold their shape better than red or green varieties. Plus they keep in the fridge for several days, making black lentils a true meal prep hero for vegetarians and omnivores alike.Where do I find them?Black lentils can be commonly found at Whole Foods, as well as online grocery sources like Amazon and Instacart. Keep an eye out in the bulk bin aisle at natural foods stores and South Asian grocers to stock up at a discount. Cooked black lentils are available in cans and some refrigerated aisles, but they\u2019ll have a shorter shelf life than dry lentils. If you can\u2019t get your hands on any black lentils, sub in green French ones, which hold their shape better than brown or red varieties.How do I use them?Black lentils are deliciously rich and earthy, and they can take on a wide range of flavors. Start building layers of flavor by simmering dry lentils in stock, or doctor up plain water with a halved onion, some crushed garlic, or a bundle of herbs. Once the lentils are tender, dress them with red wine vinegar or spices sizzled in ghee.  Try combinations like cumin, coriander, and mustard seeds, or red pepper flakes, lemon juice, and peanuts saut\u00e9ed in olive oil.With a batch of cooked lentils prepped, you\u2019re halfway to a world of seriously excellent dinners. Scatter them across a loaded sweet potato, replace whole grains for a sturdy legume-based dinner bowl, or use them to bulk up a leafy salad. Cooked black lentils can also be pur\u00e9ed, roasted, and otherwise repurposed into a wide array of savory snacks. Blend them into a creamy, herby dip or quickly marinate 'em in spiced vinegar and pair with crunchy vegetables to upgrade any crudit\u00e9s plate. The options are endless\u2014well, at least until those lentils run out.Load up a sweet potato with lentils:Loaded Sweet PotatoesWe like to roast the sweet potatoes ahead of time then rewarm them by flattening and crisping them in a skillet until lightly charred.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishFeel Good Food PlanLentilPantry ObsessionLegumeRead MoreLifestyleThe 7 Healthyish Ingredients We're Going to Be Using Nonstop This YearGallery7 SlidesBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
