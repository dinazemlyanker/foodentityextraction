In the 79 years that Tonki has been in operation, very little has changed. While tonkatsu has certainly evolved a great deal in the last eight decades, here the recipe is the same, and flavors are simple, meaty, and comforting. Dinner at Tonki is a trip home, even if you\u2019ve never been to here before.ORDER THE: rosu katsu  (sirloin), for a thick, fatty cut, or the hire katsu (tenderloin) for a leaner flavor. Everything comes with rice, pickles, and tonjiru (a pork and miso soup). They will ask for your order as soon as you walk in, so just tell them what you want and find a seat while you wait. Watching a kitchen this old and practiced is a theater unto itself.THE VIBE IS: an Ozu film you can eat. Even though it\u2019s minimal in aesthetic, the shop drips with the history of the generations of Tokyoites that have dined here. It\u2019s a place of family dinners, devoted regulars, and stories still being told.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Wednesday to Monday from 4 p.m. to 10:45 p.m. Closed on Tuesdays, and the third Monday of the month. The staff does not speak any English, but an English menu is available with the basics. The nearest subway station is Meguro.Photo by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneGenerations of Tokyoites have eaten at Tonki in its 79 years.\nPhoto by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneThe best seats in the house have a view of the masterfully-moving kitchen.\nBy Kee Byung-keunExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
