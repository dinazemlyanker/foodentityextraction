For a thicker, creamier porridge, feel free to cook the rice for a few extra minutes until it is beginning to fall apart. \u200b\u200bTo make it vegetarian, use vegetable broth or water in place of chicken broth.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I used 2 cups of broth to 1/2 cup rice and it was still soupy. Best to leave the cheese for the cheese board because the chili oil was overpowering and I didn\u2019t get any of the cheesy taste ( I admit I may have added too much.) KenBoquete Panam\u00e1 1/20/2022I made it with vegetable broth because that is what I had in the pantry and recipe was fabulous. I\u2019ve passed it on to several friends and family members\n\nIt was easy, economical and delicious. I will make it againAnonymousOhio10/26/2021This looks absolutely delicious!!! SondraPennsylvania 10/12/2021I tweaked a few things, but it was delicious. I used 12 cups of mushroom stock, 1 cup of same rice as the recipe, 1 bunch of kale, two big handfuls of spinach, 8oz total of baby bell, shitaki and oyster mushrooms, same amount of extra sharp cheddar, and the chili oil. Came out great!Kangaroo Albany NY10/12/2021I really liked this. I reduced broth to 4 cups and added some minced garlic to it. I used one bunch of chard. Came out close to risotto without all the work.AnonymousClearwater Florida 10/1/2021Good base recipe. I saut\u00e9ed the chard (one bunch) in a little oil with about 20 cloves of garlic, and a splash of white wine before throwing it in the broth. Vicious California 10/1/2021Needed some mods but it\u2019s a very cozy, quick, simple dish that we enjoyed for a weeknight dinner. First, the greens ratio is WAY off. We did about 3/4 bunch of kale and called it because there were so many greens in there relative to rice and broth. Topped with Momofuku chili crunch which brought a much needed kick. Will make again, easy weeknight healthy dish.Andrea9/30/2021this dish was terrible. the portions seem way off and was basically wet salad. i am a loyal BA reader/subscriber, but this was not it!Renatta Gorski9/29/2021This dish is nice and easy comfort food. I added chinese five spice and shrimp to amp it up a bit or else it felt a little underwhelming, and also used szechuan chilly pepper oil to tie everything together. Super quick, good week day recipe.
