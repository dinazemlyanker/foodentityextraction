If you are a fan of the Tumblr\u2014RIP!\u2014account \u201cThings Fitting Perfectly into Other Things,\u201d you understand.I take great pleasure in succeeding (and, can I just say, my track record is pretty remarkable), but I also live for the risks: Stakes are high when pearl couscous might overflow, rolling into that crevice between the counter and the oven, or a tomato-y, turmeric-y soup might exceed the capacity of the \u201cairtight\u201d container by just a couple tablespoons and dribble all over the sides.And I\u2019m telling you this, uh, why exactly? Because I had one of my greatest \u201cwill it fit?\u201d victories when I made senior associate food editor Molly Baz\u2019s chickpeas and greens frittata. The frittata fit perfectly into the cast-iron skillet that I had selected\u2014if I had added one more egg or one more leaf of kale, the levies would\u2019ve broken and I would\u2019ve had a big ol\u2019 mess. But alas, this dinner was my destiny: I ended up with a thick, fluffy-yet-creamy frittata full of all of the good stuff.As Adam Rapoport writes, better a thick frittata than a thin one. Whereas my past experiments have been sad, flimsy things, yielding pancake-thin egg slices that needed to be sandwiched between focaccia to pass for a meal, this 12-egg behemoth is packed with all of the foods that make up a fully fledged, very adult dinner: an unbelievable amount of greens (don't worry, they will wilt) and plenty of spiced chickpeas (a good, cheap, and readily available source of protein). There are also herbs galore (whatever you\u2019ve got\u2014I had basil and chives), red pepper flakes, lots o\u2019 dairy (Molly suggests sour cream, but I used Greek yogurt), and a garlic mayo garnish to make you feel like you\u2019re eating Spanish tortilla.The key to this frittata is starting the eggs on the stove before moving them to the oven. Once you\u2019ve cooked the beans and greens, you pour the egg-dairy mixture on top and gently scramble over low heat to achieve soft curds (this was difficult on account of my near-bursting pan, but I persevered): By jumpstarting the cooking process, you ensure that the frittata cooks evenly when it goes into the oven (otherwise, the interior will remain liquidy long after the edges have set). When you\u2019re finished on the stove, transfer the pan to the oven for ten-ish minutes to finish the cooking process: It can still be a little wobbly in the middle, as the hot pan will continue to transfer heat to the eggs once it\u2019s out of the oven, but you don\u2019t want any of that slimy raw egg nonsense (I broiled the frittata for a couple of minutes to banish it).My finished frittata, crispy on the top but still soft in the middle, puffed up in the oven\u2019s heat: It came out hugging the skillet\u2019s curves so snugly, like this kitten in its kitten-sized hole, that I shrieked with joy. Champion! The only remaining \u201cwill it fit?\u201d challenge: How I was to get as many slices into my stomach as possible. But don\u2019t you worry\u2014I found room.Get the recipe:Spiced Chickpeas and Greens FrittataWhen in doubt, frittata.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titWeeknightFrittataDinnerRead MoreEgg and Merguez WrapsRecipes you want to make.
