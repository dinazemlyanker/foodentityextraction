While there are a number of laudable international patisseries in Tokyo, none of those mammoths can compete with an operation that is scarcely bigger than the typical Tokyo apartment. Specializing in the pastries of Portugal, Nata de Cristiano makes some of the city\u2019s most beloved treats. The pastel de nata (Portuguese egg tarts) are beautiful in form and, thanks to high-quality Japanese eggs, exceptionally rich. Their only fault is their irresistibility\u2014which is all the more reason to order some extra.ORDER THE: pastel de nata. Buy as many as you think you can stand, then order at least one more than you estimated. They come in both mini and large sizes, but the large requires you to order a day in advance (either stop by the shop or give them a call). Grab a pao de lo for something more dramatic: What looks like a cottony sponge cake from the outside reveals a yolky center once you tear it open.THE VIBE IS: neighborhood bakery winnowed down to its bare essentials. The shop itself is only a window that opens onto the bakery, where pan after pan of pastel de nata are being constantly prepared and, other than a small bench outside the door, there is no seating. Take your haul of goodies to Yoyogi Park, where you can enjoy them at a leisurely pace.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open daily from 10:00 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Yoyogi-Hachiman is the nearest subway station.Photo by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneThe \"shop\" is little more than a window opening onto the bakery.\nBy Kee Byung-keunExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
