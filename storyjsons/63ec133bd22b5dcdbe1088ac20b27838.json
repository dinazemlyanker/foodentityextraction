Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,This week on the site, we\u2019re talking about cannabis and food: How to eat weed, how to cook with it, and how to actually enjoy it now that the plant is accessible (and legal) in more places than ever before. There\u2019s a ton of great stuff to read, like a guide to buying ethical weed, an extremely doable step-by-step guide to making your own weed butter, some of our favorite cannabis-adjacent products (Do I need a 24K-gold eggplant-shaped pipe? No, but boy do I want it.), and a profile of the woman who baked 600 pot brownies a day for AIDS patients\u2014then helped pass the first medical marijuana law in the country. And, of course, there\u2019s tons to cook too: mango smoothies, brown butter carrots, and lemon semifreddo, all infused with your CBD oil of choice.Are carrot coins cool again?\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiHere at Healthyish, we\u2019re experts in food, not cannabis, so we tapped Broccoli, a magazine about women and weed, to help us out. Luckily their founder and creative director Anja Charbonneau was very down, so we worked together between Portland, OR, and NYC (with help from contributors around the country and in Mexico) to create this dreamy, delicious guide. You can read it in Broccoli\u2019s gorgeous new spring issue or on Healthyish today.And to celebrate, we\u2019re having breakfast! On Monday, our friends at Future of Women threw an amazing porridge party and cannabis convo at Porridge and Puffs in L.A. And on May 8th, they\u2019re helping us host a second breakfast and panel at Kopitiam in NYC. It\u2019s sold out, but if you snagged a ticket, I\u2019ll see you there.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish EditorP.S. A few months ago we were honored to publish this essay from Fatima Ali on Healthyish; chef Fati passed away a few months later. On Friday, her piece received the James Beard Award for Shortform Personal Essay. Her brother, Mohammad Ali, came to NYC to accept the award on her behalf, and he asked the audience: \u201cWhat would you do if you were in Fatima\u2019s shoes? Who would you call? After that, ask yourself, what are you waiting for? Enjoy the things in life that are simple and beautiful. Thank you everyone who was involved in her life.\"Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletteressayRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
