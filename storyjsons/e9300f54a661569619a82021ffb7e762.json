Food Styling by Kat Boytsova.FacebookTwitterEmailThere used to be exactly one thing I didn\u2019t like about baking. I called it the Peanut Butter Problem and it happened every time I made my favorite three-ingredient cookies. The Peanut Butter Problem was, as you may have guessed, my best attempt to get a precise amount of peanut butter from a measuring cup into a mixing bowl, and it involved multiple butter knives, my pointer finger, and swearing. I\u2019m told I looked like a very drunk person trying to pick a lock while blindfolded.And then came TikTok.I\u2019m not proud that it took me 30 years and eleven months to learn a very basic kitchen skill through aimless scrolling. But I have to live with my truth: It wasn\u2019t until I saw the solution demonstrated by user @stoveandgarden that I realized I could, once and for all, put the Peanut Butter Problem to bed.The trick? Simply oil your measuring spoons and cups before measuring sticky ingredients.TikTok contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.There are two ways to do it: The first is to dip a finger in oil (hereby referred to as your \u201coily fingie\u201d) and swoop it around the inside of a measuring spoon or cup, using your oily fingie pad to grease the bottom like you\u2019re coloring it in. (Or, if you have an oil spritzer, just give the inside of the cup a good 360\u00b0 spray-down.) Be sure to use a flavorless oil, like sunflower or grapeseed if oil isn\u2019t included in the recipe otherwise.The second method applies to recipes that already call for oil. In these cases you can simply measure in a strategic order for automatic cup-greasing. If you\u2019re making an Olive Oil Cake with maple buttercream to top it, for example, use your measuring cup to dole out the oil first when you\u2019re prepping cake batter. Then, use the same cup\u2014unwashed\u2014to measure the maple syrup for the frosting. If you\u2019re making Dan Dan Noodles, measure the vegetable oil before the sesame paste. If you\u2019re making a vinaigrette, measure the olive oil before the honey. (It should be noted that while this method doesn\u2019t strictly involve an oily fingie, legally, no one can stop you from saying \u201coily fingie\u201d as much as you like, even if you\u2019re alone.)Whichever way I do it, I\u2019ve found that the benefits of oiling my cups are plentiful. I don\u2019t need to dirty extra silverware for the dreaded side-scrape. I no longer need to wait for every last drop of agave to drip from a measuring cup before getting on with my day because it simply falls out with ease. And I end up with a much more accurate amount of the sticky ingredients in recipes. Best of all, I can finally retire the moniker \u201cPeanut Butter Problem\u201d for something more uplifting, like a puppy, or an autobiography.Explore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
