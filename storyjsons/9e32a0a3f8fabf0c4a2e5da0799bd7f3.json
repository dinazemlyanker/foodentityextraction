Check out their spring issue, and click here to read more about how to make cannabis delicious.Mainstream cannabis culture has long been defined by stoner-bro comedies like Pineapple Express and graphic tees plastered with Bart Simpson hitting a blunt. Today you can still find Baked Bros\u2122 gummies at the dispensary, see billboards with bikini-clad models above the slogan \u2018Nice Grass,\u201d and pass questionable rasta gear on every beach boardwalk. But as recreational marijuana becomes legal in more and more states (currently ten plus Washington D.C., with more on the horizon), a different\u2014and decidedly feminine\u2014aesthetic is beginning to take hold.\u201cSo many cannabis brands felt extremely masculine, in the sense that if there was a woman in an image, she was being hypersexualized by the male gaze to sell products,\u201d says Maya Shaw, the creator of Shaw, a cannabis lifestyle shop based in New York. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like women and LGBT+ people had a space where we felt celebrated and seen as a respected consumer.\u201dShaw is part of a wave of woman-led online shops like Yew Yew and Tetra selling accessories for a new era of cannabis consumption. Think modern ceramic pipes shaped like macaroni noodles and seashells\u2014which look eons away from the standard-issue glass pipes sold at bodegas and on boardwalks\u2014crafted by women and non-binary artisans.\u201cMy first glass bowl looked like a penis,\u201d Shaw says, laughing. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a bodega bong or pipe, but how can these feminine shapes and curvatures be celebrated instead?\u201dThis aesthetic shift is chronicled in the pages of indie publications like Broccoli and Gossamer, amid articles on treating PMS with weed, psychedelic floral art, and other dispatches from the new frontier of cannabis culture.It\u2019s clear that women who like weed are more visible than ever, which has created an unprecedented time of opportunity for collaboration and community building. \u201cI love to witness the surge of knowledge-based conversation at events and women and marginalized communities coming together,\u201d says cannabis entrepreneur Mennlay Golokeh Aggrey, who is speaking at Broccoli\u2019s In Bloom festival later this month.But as cannabis becomes a venture-capital darling, it\u2019s coming up against the same gender inequalities found in tech and beyond.\u201cI think there really is a great opportunity for women right now, but I think the chips are stacked against them, and the stakes are higher from a financial perspective,\u201d says Kristi Knoblich Palmer, the co-founder of Kiva Confections. \u201cEverybody in the California industry is raising money right now, and I think there\u2019s a hint of the old boys\u2019 club when you start dealing with private equity or investment groups.\u201dAnd even when investment comes, strings can be attached. Kieryn Wang, a digital marketer in Seattle, got her start working at the female-focused cannabis brand Van der Pop in late 2015. It was an exciting time in a burgeoning industry\u2014Wang recalls educating consumers about CBD years before the acronym was a part of our mainstream vocabulary\u2014but when the brand was sold to a publicly traded company, things felt different. \u201cWe were actually bought out by a male-owned company that put men in management positions,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of why I left, because men were telling women how to run a women-focused brand, which happens a lot.\u201dWhile VC funding remains the shortcut to mainstream success, the femme cannabis community is building their own networks. Despite Instagram\u2019s nebulous community guidelines around cannabis, many brands use the platform to connect entrepreneurs with consumers and even raise funds for criminal justice reform. Offline, panels and networking events allow women who like weed to share knowledge, network, and hold space. Handmade ceramic pipes may never become the new bodega mainstay, but the women defining modern cannabis culture refuse to get lost in the haze of the green rush.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishCannabisWomen in CannabisessayRead MoreLifestyle4 Classic Cannabis Cookbooks We Can\u2019t Believe ExistGallery4 SlidesBy Anja CharbonneauRecipes you want to make.
