In the BA Test Kitchen, I don\u2019t consider my station to be set up until there are at least 50 tasting spoons in the crock on my counter, and when I walk, my spoon-filled pockets jangle like a villain\u2019s spurs in a spaghetti Western. Tasting food, thinking about it, talking about it, and deciding whether it can be better is the crux of my job\u2014and my life. So when I discovered a tasting spoon that felt better in my hand, a touch softer against my bottom lip, and that stood a little taller on my counter, there was no going back.That spoon is Umeshiso\u2019s Little Dipper.Developed for coffee cupping (tasting), with a short handle but a deep round bowl, these spoons have established a dangerous new precedent in my life, the same way sleeping on 600-thread-count sheets for a night will ruin all other bedding for you. I can barely look at another spoon now that I eat with it, cook with it, and use it in all my photographs (the rose gold looks great with everything). And I learned that other loyal fans use it to scoop ice cream and portion out cookie dough (they don\u2019t bend easily!), so I\u2019ll probably start doing that too.The excellence of this spoon is no accident. Specialty coffee veteran Umeko Motoyoshi founded Umeshiso with this kind of frequency (if not variety) of use in mind: \u201cI\u2019m in a unique position because spoons are all I care about,\u201d they say. \u201cMost people use spoons to eat for a few minutes and that\u2019s it. They don\u2019t have to use a spoon over and over again for hours to cup 50 coffees.\u201d Which helps explain why everything about it was so highly considered. Even its weight was field-tested to see what people in the industry liked using best (56\u201359 grams, FYI).But utility isn\u2019t the only thing these spoons have going for them, either. Motoyoshi launched Umeshiso with the intention of making coffee cupping\u2014an experience typically dominated by white men\u2014more inclusive. \u201cThe first Umeshiso spoon was rainbow-colored, as a reminder to myself\u2014a queer, mixed race, nonbinary femme\u2014that I can show up with my rainbow spoon and be my rainbow self,\u201d they say. \u201cThat I deserve to be there and my perspectives and my palate are valid.\u201dOverall, it adds up to a spoon that does a better job of being a spoon than any other spoon I own.Umeshiso Little Dipper Spoon$8 at EtsyUmeshiso prices spoons on a sliding scale to provide them more affordably so customers can pay what they can.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendToolsRecipes you want to make.
