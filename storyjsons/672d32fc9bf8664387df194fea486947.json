The same goes for their appetite. Femi Oyediran and Miles White have quite a detailed agenda for their perfect day in Charleston, starting with coffee, pastries, and a bike ride and ending with the city\u2019s best views (at a Holiday Inn no less) and, naturally, lots of oysters.Check out more food-focused itineraries from our favorite food people here.This barstool at Bar George has your name all over it.Photo Courtesy Bar GeorgeHello, Rainbow Row!Photo by Peter Frank Edwards/ReduxCharlestonWe start off at Sightsee Shop + Coffee. It\u2019s the ideal neighborhood spot, where everybody knows everybody. Joel Sadler, one of the owners, just gets you excited about coffee (they serve Springbok; we love those guys too).Babas on Cannon is a few blocks away, perfect for a prelunch snack and a pick-me-up. Grab a couple pastries, maybe a sandwich, and enjoy the scenery right off King Street from the patio. Then head out for a bike ride. We\u2019ll usually take King Street all the way down to The Battery and get lost in the streets.Next, we hit up 167 Raw for lunch, a pretty clutch move. (To avoid long waits, do a late lunch around 3 p.m. or go on slower days, Tuesdays or Wednesdays.) Start out with drinks, order ceviche and a dozen oysters, and it\u2019ll feel like something\u2019s building. It\u2019s like how your California friends leave the airport and head straight to In-N-Out. 167\u2019s the same for us, just infinitely more bougie. You really get this grand introduction to the city.Make sure to go next door to House of Nomad, an eclectic, curated home goods store nearby. Miles got his mom some funky cookbooks and a huge antique kudu horn from there\u2014best Christmas she\u2019s had in a while.If you\u2019re down to venture off the peninsula, any true Charlestonian knows the best views in the city are from the Holiday Inn\u2019s Harborview Restaurant & Lounge, next to the Waffle House in West Ashley. Stop there for a happy hour drink on the way to The Pourhouse on James Island for an early show on the deck (free on Sunday and Monday nights).Then cross the street and get more oysters, plus hot dogs and Peruvian spit-roasted chickens at Bar George. Or head downtown for dinner at Chubby Fish. It just reopened, and it\u2019s better than ever.Wrap it up with late night drinks at Dalila\u2019s or Doar Bros. It\u2019s an aggressive day, but a solid day.WHERE TO STAY:Stay Duvet for rentals with a historic downtown feelWHAT TO BRING BACK:\u00a0High Wire Distilling Co.\u2019s Southern Amaro, or the Sorghum Whiskey if you can find itExplore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsTravelCharlestonRecipes you want to make.
