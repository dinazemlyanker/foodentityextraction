I was in the middle of baking my \u201csignature cake,\u201d the one I got recruited into baking for all of our family events: Duncan Hines Devil\u2019s Food from a box, frosted with Martha Stewart\u2019s chocolate ganache (from a printed recipe I guarded like a treasure), filled with a layer of strawberries, the sides coated in sliced almonds. The second the lights, oven, and AC shut off, I remember my mother scolding me for baking a cake on the hottest day of the year (as if I could have predicted the outcome), though the heat didn\u2019t bother me.Baking in heat waves is a compulsion that\u2019s stayed with me all these years, though I\u2019ve since traded box mixes and Martha for genoise and Mary\u2014Berry, that is. The second the temperature crosses 80\u00b0, a subconscious impulse kicks in that compels me to break out the butter, and I become a baker possessed, turning out trays of scones, biscuits, and cookies like I\u2019m vying for Star Baker. Which is how a few weeks ago I spent 36 hours baking this seven-layer confection of genoise sponge, mango curd, and vanilla bean Swiss meringue buttercream for absolutely no reason.I remember when the pastry chef Natasha Pickowicz came into the test kitchen back in 2018 to shoot a magazine story featuring her impossibly chic (and complicated!) layer cakes. Aside from being wowed by the sheer amount of work involved in making the individual cake components, I remember being blown away by her nature-inspired decorations: blue thistles, golden husk cherries, tomato skins that had been dehydrated to look like giant, fantastic petals. I also remember thinking, I will never, ever make this cake. Who has the time! Who has the patience!I\u2019m still figuring out the patience bit, but in the absence of the usual summer balms (jam-packed barbecues, late-night house parties, beach trips in crammed cars), it turns out time is pretty much all I\u2019ve had these days. And when you\u2019re bored of going nowhere and seeing no one (I am being hyperbolic, but not by much) and craving a dose of the fantastic, the extraordinary, the outrageous, sometimes a temporary salve can come in the form of a truly ridiculous cake that requires 28 eggs, multiple trips to the farmers market, and two days to make (also two weeks to eat). I\u2019m not convinced I\u2019ll ever make another one, but that\u2019s okay. This one did its job.Not Cake, But Still Good:Photo by Emma Fishman, Food Styling by Susie Theodorou, Prop Styling by Elizabeth JaimeCoconut Tofu Stir-FryBlueberry and Peach Graham GaletteVietnamese Tomato SaladSpicy Pickled Summer BeansShrimp and Basil Stir-FryHot Honey WingsExplore Bon App\u00e9titWhat's Chaey Cooking?LifestyleRecipes you want to make.
