Don\u2019t ever, ever do this.By Marissa A. RossJune 11, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailIllustrations by George WylesolFacebookTwitterEmailIf you are having thoughts of suicide, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, at 1-800-273-talk (8255), or the Suicide Crisis Line, at 1-800-784-2433, or text 741741.I didn\u2019t wake up to my alarm last Friday. I thought it was my alarm as I swam my arms under the pillows, trying to find my phone that wouldn\u2019t stop buzzing. Instead it was texts from concerned friends. I had no idea what they were talking about, and I literally thought to myself, \u201cJesus Christ, who died?!\u201d By now, we all know that it was Anthony Bourdain.It was a hard day. It\u2019s still hard. Like so many others across all industries and continents, Bourdain was one of my greatest heroes. He made me believe that I could pursue a life and career in wine that could benefit the community, consumers, and the world, while still being true to myself.It was hard for another reason too. The texts from friends were followed by messages from strangers, all asking the same deeply concerning question. It\u2019s one of the most popular questions I've gotten since the 2016 election from readers and publications alike: \u201cWhat wine should you drink when you\u2019re sad?\u201dMy answer is always the same: None.No one likes this response. It\u2019s not nearly as quirky or comical as they want from a woman whose whole life seems to be drinking wine and having fun (I promise you, there\u2019s a lot more to it than that). But it\u2019s the response that deserves to be heard and never is. The only reason I seem like I\u2019m always drinking wine and having fun is because one of the few rules I live by is that I never, ever drink when I am sad.Admittedly sometimes I\u2019ll be drinking and then I get sad, but that\u2019s because alcohol is a depressant: It\u2019s only going to make you feel sadder. And while I am all for a good cathartic cry, you shouldn\u2019t do it with alcohol. You should do it with a therapist, loved ones, or your favorite Pixar movie.Not only is alcohol a depressant, but pouring a drink to escape emotion is a bad habit, one that has been glamorized by everyone from Charles Bukowski to the cast of Sex & the City to today\u2019s top 40 music. It's a habit that's so easy to fall into and so hard to get out of. I\u2019ve watched alcoholism destroy people I love. It always starts as a drink to deal with something until it becomes drinking to deal with everything.Wine is joyful. It is one of the most joyful things on this Earth. It\u2019s like food and music and sex and art, incredible delights that we can indulge and devour and find immeasurable pleasure in. But if you drink wine because you\u2019re sad, you start to associate it with those feelings. It strips wine of its ability to take you to places you\u2019ve never been, to remind you of memories you love, or to be present in the place and memories you are creating as you drink the wine right then.That\u2019s why we love wine, right? Because it is transportive and delicious and it brings people together. And it should always be associated with these things.So please don\u2019t drink wine when you\u2019re sad. Drink because you\u2019re happy. Drink because you\u2019re in love\u2014with someone, or many, or the world, or the city, or the meal, or yourself, or art, or that cute dog that walked by and licked your knee. Drink wine because it\u2019s a beautiful day or because you\u2019re stoked on your new project or you\u2019re just feeling good. Drink to celebrate life, not to deal with loss.Explore Bon App\u00e9titWineAnthony BourdainHealthyishessayRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
