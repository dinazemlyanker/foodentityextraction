The dollop of yogurt is a must.AnonymousBrooklyn, NY3/2/2022I make this often! I always add a cubed sweet potato and a can of chickpeas to the recipe. Then usually add a little more water, curry powder and salt accordingly. The recipe is very forgiving! I love it :)AnonymousChampaign, IL1/24/2022We made this in the slow cooker and it turned out great! I sauteed the onions, etc and spices, then dumped everything in slow cooker (except for the spinach and tomatoes). Six hours on low, then I stirred in the spinach and tomatoes and brought it back to temp. What a great smell to come home to, especially on a cold day!AnonymousSaint Paul, MN1/17/2022Delicious! This dish needs some acid to bring it together, in my opinion - so I subbed the cayenne for a vinegar based hot sauce and a splash of apple cider vinegar, both added right at the end. Otherwise, I make this recipe as written.AliciaToronto, Ontario12/31/2021This is incredible. I added a little quinoa but otherwise left the recipe as is, and no regrets! So tasty, will make again. AileenHalifax, NS12/14/2021Deeeelicious! As tasty a lentil dish as I have ever eaten. It has become a weekly standby\nJR Lyonshawaii11/26/2021Great soup! Very easy, made with things you likely already have, and keeps well! I've been eating this soup all week and it keeps getting better. SOO good with a dollop of good yogurt. It's just what you want in your back pocket during the winter!CorrinaFort Collins, CO11/9/2021This soup is amazing! I used 10 oz of baby kale in place of the frozen spinach because I had some in my CSA that needed to be used. Because I didn\u2019t have cayenne pepper, I also added one de-seeded fish pepper (a rather spicy pepper that Black farmers cultivated here in the Chesapeake Bay region), and if you like extra spice, I recommend adding a finely chopped hot pepper of your choice with the garlic and ginger. But truly delicious and fairly delicious to make. I\u2019ll definitely be adding this to my fall/winter soup rotation! MegWashington DC9/26/2021Tonight is my 2nd time making and I love the recipe even more. For starters, if you see a recipe with a rating of 4.8 stars and over 200 reviews, its a MUST TRY in my book. I stumbled across this recipe because I was looking for a new vegan recipe to surprise my husband with. The first time I made it he was sweating from the intense heat of the cayenne (sorry babe), but he still ate almost 4 bowls. This time I prepared without the cayenne and it is literally still SOOO tasty! I used a can of Fire Roasted Tomatoes because I was out of the normal kind which was nice because it was visually more appealing. I also added in 2 fresh tomatoes because I always like the taste of fresh tomatoes in a soup. Lastly, I used Thai Yellow Curry paste instead of curry powder. The paste does has a bit of a kick (This may be why my husband was sweating the first time, as I used the paste on this attempt with cayenne lol), so this is why I did not use cayenne. Don't hesitate to try this recipe. You will love it and it will definitely become a family favoriteTynisha VargasChicago, IL9/14/2021Yum. My family loves this soup. The smells while cooking are delicious!! I use garam masala in the place of the curry as I don\u2019t love curry powder & I think the garam masala just blends beautifully with the coconut, garlic & ginger notes. We are not vegan so we do top with the Greek yogurt. It just adds a nice tang & a creaminess you don\u2019t get with coconut milk. This is really surprisingly delicious for such a simple recipe & I LOVE the unexpected use of shredded coconut here.April HFranklin, TN3/23/2021I\u2019ve made this recipe so many times my family thinks its mine. Its always a hit and its become a bi-monthly request! I use Jamaican hot curry and a bit more Cayenne but it taste wonderful!!Jay\ud83e\udd17DC2/21/2021Hearty and flavorful soup! Reminds me of thai food. I'd recommend using a garlic press for the garlic and a microplane for the ginger to avoid annoying chunks. Couldn't find \"split\" red lentils so I used normal red ones and they worked fine. Serving with yogurt is amazing--try it with fresh cilantro on top too! AnonymousChicago, IL2/6/2021This is the best soup ever. I make it all the time. Usually I just put a ton of smoked paprika, turmeric and some cardamom instead of curry powder and it always turns out amazing. Sometimes I add quinoa too. AnonymousCroatia2/1/2021LOVE THIS RECIPE !!!!  I added two finely diced carrots and a can of corn kernels. Also did 4 tsp of curry powder and 1 tsp of garam masala.  Served with light sour cream.AlanaAdelaide, Australia1/29/2021From the first time I saw the picture, I knew I would like this soup. However, I have made this several times and I love it more each time I make it. It is so warming and delicious. It is a hug in a bowl. The only change I made was using vegetable stock instead of water. \nThis is a 5 plus star!! Incredible.
