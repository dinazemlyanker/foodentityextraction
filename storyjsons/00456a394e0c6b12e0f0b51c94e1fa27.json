Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,Last night I saw an old friend, someone I hadn\u2019t seen in far too long considering how close we live and how fond we are of each other. We met in a college writing class, but our social orbits never really overlapped until we both ended up in New York in our early twenties. Lonely and hungry, we ate at restaurants we couldn\u2019t afford on grad-school stipends and entry-level salaries. We\u2019d talk about dating and writing and how much we loved New York, though in hindsight it was steamrolling us, or me at least. After a couple years we fell out of sync again. We both moved and came back, got more degrees and different jobs (actual, paying jobs!), fell in and out of love, and ten years later, met up for dinner again.At the bar at Saint Julivert, we talked about this distinctly New York phenomenon: We have so many friends in this city...and we never see them. We\u2019re all ping-ponging around like unstable atoms, crashing into each other for a meal or a few glasses of wine, then careening out into the city\u2019s dark matter again. My friend had spent the past year experimenting with holding still. \u201cIf I just stand in one place, everyone will eventually run into me\u201d is how she put it. That\u2019s meant cooking dinner every Sunday for whomever wants to come, then emailing a little dispatch about what she cooked and whatever else is on her mind.We talked about how lucky we feel to be able to write regularly. My friend keeps her newsletter list small on purpose so she can write as candidly as she wants. The Healthyish list, on the other hand, has reached a size that makes me sweat to think about. I said this, and my friend reminded me of a thing Lady Gaga said in an interview a few years back, about how you should play a dive bar like it\u2019s an arena and an arena like it\u2019s a dive bar. I think I\u2019ve done this unwittingly as Healthyish has grown; most of the time I willfully ignore the number of people who may be tuning in. And I hope to keep doing it that way.Speaking of newsletters, this one by Helena Fitzgerald is a hot take on the best song of the last decade that\u2019s not really about a song at all. For a coming-of-age essay set in a different city, read Liz Riggs on the Nashville wine shop that eased her into adulthood. Also on Healthyish this week, a dashi oats recipe joins the ranks of my beloved dinner scramble: a so-called breakfast food turned into a super simple and cozy weeknight dinner. (Yes I ate the leftovers for breakfast, and you can too). We need recipes like these oats more than ever this month, as our ping-ponging reaches max velocity. This is a reminder to myself as much as to you: You don\u2019t have to RSVP \u201cyes\u201d to everything. You can go home and cook yourself an easy meal.And one other reminder: We have a lot of opinions on the gifts you should be giving this year. Check out our guide for all the hyper-specific recs.Thanks, as always, for reading.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish EditorP.S. Last week\u2019s newsletter didn\u2019t send because of ~technical difficulties~, but it\u2019s up on the site now if you care about a curmudgeonly take on Thanksgiving...and who I finally decided to thank this year.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletteressayRead MoreLifestyle[*whispers*] I Don\u2019t Like ThanksgivingBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
