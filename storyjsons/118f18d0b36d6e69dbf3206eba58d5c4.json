The idea of dead skin being sizzled off my face is highly appealing, and chemical exfoliants, which dissolve dead skin cells, well, chemically rather than physically are generally a bang-for-your-buck product: They brighten dull skin, treat breakouts, minimize the look of fine lines, and even help your other skincare products better penetrate your skin. So when Herbivore Botanicals, the skincare brand best known for their jade rollers and Instagram-friendly facial oils, debuted the Prism Exfoliating Glow Potion, I wanted to try it.\u201cDo you know Sunday Riley\u2019s Good Genes?\u201d asks Julia Wills, co-founder of Herbivore, referring to the popular lactic-acid treatment. \u201cIt\u2019s like that, but natural.\u201d Historically, natural skincare products haven\u2019t been nearly as effective as mainstream products, and I\u2019m generally skeptical of Mother Earth\u2019s ability to Benjamin Button me.But Wills tells me that it took a few years to get the fruit acid -based, synthetic-free formula right, and the ingredient list is pretty impressive. The serum has natural sources of all of my favorite chemical exfoliants: glycolic acid from sugar cane, salicylic acid from willow bark and aloe, malic acid from apple, citric acid from orange, and lactic acid from the Tolkien-sounding bilberry (it looks like a blueberry; saved you a click).The serum also delivers vitamin C, derived from kakadu plum, for its brightening properties, as well as a blend of rose water, aloe water, and a vegan form of sodium hyaluronate to hydrate skin. Its end-goal is to brighten your skin through this combination of exfoliation and moisturizing.When I swap out my usual exfoliant for Prism, I\u2019m first surprised by how good it smells. It\u2019s the first chemical exfoliant I\u2019ve used that doesn\u2019t smell like the floor of a hospital, but like rosewater instead. It\u2019s easy to spread, too, and it sinks in quickly. There\u2019s no tingling, stinging, or burning\u2014and while it\u2019s nice to not have to fan my face after exfoliating, I kind of miss the feeling.Still, it does a decent job at brightening my skin and keeping my breakouts at bay. What I find especially appealing is that it serves as an exfoliant, antioxidant serum, and moisturizer in one. When the midsummer air begins to feel like dog breath, it feels good to apply one lightweight product and call it a day.Still, I do get a few errant zits that I know my usual paint-stripper formula could take down in a second, and while they eventually disappear, the process takes a day or two longer with Prism. But that makes sense: It\u2019s just not as powerful, and therefore not as harsh, as a formula packed with synthetic stuff.And that\u2019s kind of the point. \u201cOut of all the exfoliating acid products on the market today, we didn\u2019t see any that were totally natural and gentle enough to use daily,\u201d Wills and her husband-cum-cofounder, Alexander Kummerow, later write to me in an email. Because of that, it\u2019s ideal for those with sensitive skin, or for someone seeking mild brightening rather than, say, a solution for stubborn breakouts.What I like best about Prism is that it\u2019s exactly what it claims to be: a gentle, clean exfoliant. And one thing that\u2019s harder to find in the skincare world than a natural and effective product?
