But the secret is generously salting the sliced tomatoes before cooking\u2014it concentrates all that tomato flavor and lets out some of the liquid. We have Heidi Swanson, the author of 101 Cookbooks, to thank for this lightning-fast weeknight dinner recipe.Ingredients4 servings4scallions1lb. cherry and/or grape tomatoes of any and all colorsKosher salt2Tbsp. toasted sesame oil, divided3garlic cloves, finely grated1\u00bdtsp. finely grated peeled ginger2\u00bdcups chilled cooked long-grain white or brown rice3large eggs, beaten to blend1Tbsp. soy sauceExtra-virgin olive oil (for drizzling)Crushed red pepper flakes (for serving; optional)\u00bdlemonPreparationStep 1Trim dark green tops from scallions and thinly slice; set aside. Thinly slice white and pale green parts; set aside separately. Quarter any larger tomatoes and halve any small ones. Place about one-quarter of tomatoes in a small bowl; season generously with salt and toss to combine. Set aside.Step 2Heat 1 Tbsp. sesame oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add reserved white and pale green parts of scallions and remaining three-quarters of tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and any liquid from tomatoes has evaporated, about 4 minutes. Mix in garlic and ginger; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add rice and stir to separate grains. Cook just to heat rice through, about 3 minutes.Step 3Scoot vegetables and rice to 1 side of skillet, then pour half of remaining sesame oil into pan. Add eggs and cook, stirring often, until just set, about 1 minute. Mix into vegetables and rice, then drizzle in soy sauce and cook, stirring, just until well combined.Step 4Transfer fried rice to a large bowl or platter. Drain salted tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil, and spoon over rice. Sprinkle with reserved scallion tops and red pepper flakes (if using) and drizzle with remaining sesame oil. Finely grate zest from lemon over.How would you rate Tomato Fried Rice?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (5)Back to TopTriangleI have to agree with Anonymous from Fort Worth...this was certainly nothing special. I had really high hopes for a bright, tomato-y succulent fried rice, but all I got was an ok dish. (And I know how to season properly, that wasn't it). I also added in some dark soy sauce for color and flavor which did little to help the dish out in the end.\nAll in all, my vegan partner (minus the egg for him) liked it well enough and it was easy to make, but I don't think I'll make it again.Sarah A.Rosslyn, VA5/26/2021This was great! It tasted really light and fresh, and highlighted the tomatoes really well. I had to add some salt to the dish after the fact, so be sure to taste it after you add the soy sauce while it\u2019s still in the pan to see if you want to add more. Otherwise this was a great, easy, delicious recipe.soapnanaChicago9/21/2019This was okay. Served it alongside some steamed green beans and carrots. It was an easy, healthy vegetarian dinner, but not one to write home about. AnonymousFort Worth 9/8/2019I sauteed some chopped bacon and added it at the end.  Also I always put in handful of chopped cilantro in my fried rice.The lemon zest is brilliant. Maybe some chopped celery would give it some crunch. Great way to use cherry tomatoes that are past salad worthy.AnonymousGlendora,  California 9/3/2019This was great! Definitely adding to my dinner rotation!PrinceGanymedeBoston, MA8/20/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titFried RiceRiceRice & GrainsCherry TomatoTomatoVegetableGrape TomatoSummerQuickEasyWeeknight MealsOne-Pot MealsMainDairy-FreeVegetarianHealthyishFryDinnerRecipes you want to make.
