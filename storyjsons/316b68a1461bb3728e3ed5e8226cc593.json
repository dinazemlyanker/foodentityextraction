Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.First off, an apology. Last week\u2019s letter had the same subject line as the awards for good boys newsletter, which I\u2019d received and placed in my \u201cNLs to Read\u201d folder a few days before writing my own. (An aside: My \u201cNLs to Read\u201d folder has outpaced my stack of unread New Yorkers, and that seems like an important turning point in this digital age). Anyway, when Healthyish assistant editor Aliza and I were batting around subject lines at the 11th hour, I thought my suggestion was, well, mine, but clearly my subconscious pulled it from someone else. Shelby: forgive my mistake. You\u2019re very funny on the internet, and I love what you do.Since we\u2019re talking newsletters, I also recommend subscribing to Edith Zimmerman\u2019s, which is called Drawing Links and features her hand-drawn comics and, yes, related links. It\u2019s charmingly meta\u2014often the comics are about her figuring out how to make a good newsletter\u2014and it sends me to places I don\u2019t otherwise find myself, like the Harvard Business Review.Other things I\u2019ve been charmed by recently:The Chinatown Collection, an NYC pop-up and online shop from Care of Chan, Sue Chan\u2019s branding and talent agency, that pays homage to NYC\u2019s Chinatown. I\u2019m obsessed with this dessert plate and bemused by this $900 ceramic representation of Mission Chinese Food\u2019s chicken wings.This article on vaping hysteria by Amanda Chicago Lewis, which is very long but very fascinating, plus the dinner party scene at the end is a perfect portrait of the LA wellness set. The lead singer of Phantom Planet makes an appearance, and that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to tell you.This indigo jumpsuit from Tilit, which appeared at a time when I thought I was done buying jumpsuits as if to say, \u201cNot so fast.\u201d It\u2019s sturdy and stretchy and, unlike other, more fashion-minded jumpsuits, feels made for both working and playing hard.Start Simple, Lukas Volger\u2019s forthcoming cookbook and one of the ones I\u2019ve been looking forward to since a galley crossed my desk last fall. I love the idea of building recipes around one basic ingredient\u2014\u201ca few sweet potatoes,\u201d \u201ca carton of eggs,\u201d or \u201ca pile of mushrooms,\u201d for example\u2014because so often that\u2019s how I think about cooking: What\u2019s one thing I have in the fridge or pantry that I want to eat, and how do I make it into a meal? I recommend pre-ordering the book, which is out Feb. 18th, because everyone I know who\u2019s ever published a book says that\u2019s a helpful thing to do.Our newest Healthyish recipe, Andy Baraghani\u2019s Fall-Apart Caramelized Cabbage, which, like Chris Morocco\u2019s Big-Flavor Broccoli before it, has given me a foolproof way to eat an entire skillet of vegetables for dinner. Don\u2019t skimp on the water before you put this baby in the oven because you need the steam to fully soften the cabbage\u2019s core. The texture you\u2019re going for here is ~ melted ~, like my heart after watching this dog who does not want to be brushed\u2014oh wait, he definitely wants to be brushed.I also have fond feelings toward Carla Lalli Music\u2019s new Healthyish turkey chili recipe. I have yet to make it myself, but I ate bowls upon bowls of it while it was in the test kitchen, and, yes, chili is a delicious thing to cook even when there is not some kind of massive sporting event on TV.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish editorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletteressayRead MoreLifestyleHating Goop Is Not a PersonalityBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
