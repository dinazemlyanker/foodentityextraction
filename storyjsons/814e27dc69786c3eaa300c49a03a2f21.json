(Yes, we said it.)By Emma WartzmanMarch 3, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Emma Fishman, Food Styling by Pearl JonesFacebookTwitterEmailThis article is part of the Basically Guide to Better Baking, a 10-week, 10-recipe series designed to help you become a cooler, smarter, more confident baker.Typical shortbread cookies are good. They\u2019re crumbly, sandy, and tender thanks to butter and sugar that have spent quality time together, and the best specimens taste as if they\u2019re barely bound by flour, dissolving when take a bite. But Molly Baz\u2019s Roasty Toasty Pecan-Caramel Shortbread Cookies are great. And the reason, my friends, is  dulce de leche.What is dulce de leche? A South American confection of sweet milk cooked down until it's the color and consistency of caramel sauce or butterscotch, it's both sweet and fatty, meaning that it can take the place of most of the sugar and some of the butter in Molly's shortbread. To prevent the cookies from being too saccharine, Molly reduced the amount of granulated sugar to 3 Tbsp. And while, in her words, \u201cthere\u2019s still a ton of butter,\u201d the dulce de leche also stands in for some of the fat.Ultimately, swapping out most of sugar and a portion of the butter with deeply flavorful dulce de leche preserves that defining shortbread texture while adding a little je ne sais quoi, a.k.a. a can\u2019t-put-your-finger-on-it complexity. Simply put, dulce de leche has a lot more going on than straight sugar and butter: As the sweetened milk reduces into the coppery brown sauce, a series of chemical reactions (known collectively as the Maillard reaction) occur between the proteins and carbohydrates in the milk. The Maillard reaction is a big part of what makes browned food\u2014from olive oil-fried eggs to grilled bread to roasted vegetables\u2014taste more delicious and intense. And, in these cookies, the toasted pecans, which mimic the buttery, caramel-y notes in the dulce de leche, certainly don\u2019t hurt either.For something like alfajores\u2014the South American sandwich cookie filled with dulce de leche from which Molly drew inspiration\u2014you want as high-quality a product as you can find. There\u2019s a whole layer of dulce de leche in there after all! These cookies, however, can handle a jar or can that\u2019s on the less expensive side of the spectrum. \u201cI would opt for really high-quality butter over really high-quality dulce de leche,\u201d Molly says. \u201cHere, it's meant to blend into the background. It\u2019s only \u00bc cup total, so don\u2019t fret. You\u2019re not tasting it straight.\u201dThat being said, dulce de leche-loving test kitchen manager Gaby Melian warns that you should check the ingredient list\u2014certain brands swap out sugar for corn syrup which, as she puts it, \u201cyuck.\u201d Once you know the confection is made with sugar, though, you\u2019re good to go.In a pinch, you also could make your own. Submerge a can of sweetened condensed milk in a pot of simmering water for two to three hours, depending on how dark you want it. But don\u2019t stray away from the stove and definitely don\u2019t lie down for a nap. You need to take care to make sure that the can is fully covered the entire time (otherwise, it could explode).Then again, you could probably make a trip to the grocery store and back (multiple times!) in two to three hours. But to each their own! As long as you make these cookies, we certainly don\u2019t care.Get the recipe:Roasty Toasty Pecan-Caramel Shortbread CookiesStore-bought dulce de leche and pulverized pecans give this tender, buttery shortbread a nuttiness and depth of flavor you can\u2019t quite put your finger on. We love the contrasting look of white nonpareil, but feel free to roll the dough in whatever sprinkles you please.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasically BakingRecipes you want to make.
