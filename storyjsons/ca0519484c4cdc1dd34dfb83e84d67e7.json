Since we don\u2019t have access to fish from Cambodia, we\u2019ve adapted this recipe by using fresh halibut that is grilled and topped with a bright and citrusy dressing loaded with aromatics. This fragrant salad is a multisensory experience\u2014every bite is infused with a different combination of crispy shallots, juicy citrus, fresh herbs, and tender, grilled fish. Yen has cooked around the world and across cuisines, but it took the pandemic for him to return to his roots\u2014the Cambodian food he first learned from his remarkable grandmother.

I'd never used it before.  As soon as I opened the jar I had second thoughts.\nThe recipe includes Thai fish sauce, which is stinky in its own right.  But the shrimp paste....good God it reeks.\nI tried watering down the sauce in which the shrimp paste is used.  I used a lot of lime juice.\n\nBut still......\n\nI threw out the jar of shrimp paste about half an hour ago.\n\nIf you ever want to get revenge on someone, smuggle a jar of shrimp paste into the house and open it.  Even better, open it and microwave it.  But you'd better run as soon as you start nuking it.  Else you'll vomit from the smell.  Rotten lobster may smell more disgusting, but not by much.\n\nIn retrospect, the recipe is bad in several respects:\n\n    It takes a wonderful mild fish -- halibut -- and overpowers it with a stinky concoction that includes Thai fish sauce and shrimp paste.  Why overpower a good mild fish like halibut with that?  If you want a strong, fishy flavor, use a fish with a strong, fishy flavor, like salmon, bluefish or even [shudder] mackerel.\n    The pomelo fruit is too difficult to peel and section.  Better to use a more easily-peeled citrus.\n    Cabbage is too crunchy for this recipe.  Field greens or spring mix would be better.\n    The portions of salad are far too large, relative to the amount of fish.  We have a large amount of leftover salad.  We will use it with smoked sockeye that I cooked last night.\n\nObviously we won't be making this recipe again.SasquatchAnytown, USA10/9/2021This was delicious! I didn\u2019t have shrimp paste, so I subbed anchovy paste instead, and it was still wonderful. Used black cod instead of halibut too. Can\u2019t wait to try again and possibly add some cashews. Thank you!AnonymousNew York, New York10/24/2020wow this looks so delicious can't wait to tryAnonymousBrooklyn, NY 10/6/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladCambodianSoutheast AsianAsianHalibutFishSeafoodMainDairy-FreeNut-FreeGluten-FreeGrillingDinnerRecipes you want to make.
