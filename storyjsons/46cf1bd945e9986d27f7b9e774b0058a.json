Can Onda Get It Right?By David TamarkinOctober 29, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailWhen Gabriela C\u00e1mara and Jessica Koslow began planning the menu for their new L.A. restaurant, Onda, they started with a pair of lists: one had C\u00e1mara\u2019s must-have dishes, the other had Koslow\u2019s. The idea was that they\u2019d take these dishes and, one by one, filter them through Onda\u2019s influences: Mexico, California, C\u00e1mara-style classicism, Koslow-style whimsy. \u201cOnda is not a Mexican restaurant. It is rooted in Mexican food.\u201d In the four months I spent talking to C\u00e1mara and Koslow this summer and fall, they both used this line to describe what Onda\u2019s food would be like. For a while, it seemed to be as far as they had gotten.Slowly, they made some progress. When C\u00e1mara wanted a gin and tonic on the cocktail list, the women decided that Onda would make the tonic from scratch, and they ran that tonic through the California filter: It would be seasonal based on the fruits and herbs sold at the nearby Santa Monica farmers market. And when Koslow wanted corn nuts on the menu (she grew up eating small ranch-flavored bags after school), they were put through a Mexico lens: tossed in salt made by dehydrating Onda\u2019s house-made hot sauce and sauerkraut.But when it came to the the fritto misto, things came to a halt. C\u00e1mara envisioned a classic dish, something like what you\u2019d find at Cala, her San Francisco restaurant, or Contramar, her destination restaurant in Mexico City. But \u201cclassic\u201d is something Koslow can\u2019t wrap her head around. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make a fritto misto that everybody else is making,\u201d she thought.While C\u00e1mara tended to her restaurants in Mexico and San Francisco, Koslow and Onda\u2019s culinary team, chef de cuisine Balo Orozco and pastry chef Jessica Stephens, worked on that fritto misto during their twice-weekly tastings. They tried all manner of fish. They dipped in all manners of batters. Nothing stuck.Onda translates to English as \u201cwave,\u201d and C\u00e1mara and Koslow are quick to say that the name, in part, refers to them being on the same wavelength. But they named the restaurant before the real work began, before they knew how much they would get hung up over a fritto misto. \u201cGabi\u2019s food is elegant and clean and minimal,\u201d Koslow says. \u201cMine can be technical and heavy.\u201d The fritto misto, she said, \u201cwas plaguing us.\u201dFor Healthyish\u2019s first cover, we went to L.A. to see how two uncompromising and visionary chefs are making it work under one sleek, sun-drenched roof.Koslow tells a version of Onda\u2019s origin story that essentially goes like this: When the Proper Hotel suggested to Koslow that she open a second location of Sqirl\u2014her Silver Lake caf\u00e9 that launched a new era of California cuisine and a thousand imitators\u2014in their Santa Monica location, the first thing Koslow did is tour the space. Walking around the Spanish colonial building, seven blocks from the ocean, Koslow says she found herself thinking, This feels so much bigger than just Sqirl. It feels like a conversation. That conversation, she thought, could be between two sister cities, places whose cuisines have intertwined for centuries: Los Angeles and Mexico City.And for that, she wanted a partner. Koslow knew C\u00e1mara from doing events with her; they were friendly, but they\u2019d never even remotely talked about opening a restaurant together. Still, Koslow thought C\u00e1mara made sense: She, like Koslow, was very young when she opened her first restaurant, Contramar. And Contramar, like Sqirl, has become a symbol, a message to the rest of the world about the food in a particular place. Contramar serves beach food but is a four-hour drive from any beach; hadn\u2019t C\u00e1mara talked about wanting to actually open on the ocean? The partnership made sense logistically too: At the time, C\u00e1mara lived just a quick plane ride north in San Francisco.The women struck a deal in the summer of 2018. Since then, the city has waited. When the Proper opened in June, Onda was still a construction zone. In July, word was Onda would open in August. In August, an opening date was set in September. From there, the delays continued. It was construction-related\u2014Koslow and C\u00e1mara had insisted on redesigning the space\u2014but the infrastructure delays gave cover to more existential questions: What kind of restaurant\u2014and whose kind of restaurant\u2014should Onda be?\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be doing this,\u201d C\u00e1mara told me over lunch in late June. We were sitting at a table on Sqirl\u2019s sidewalk patio, the famously long line a little shorter now that it was after 2 p.m. C\u00e1mara\u2019s life is too full, too busy, she said; opening another restaurant is \u201ccrazy.\u201d She\u2019d felt that way when Koslow called her in 2018, but now the insanity of the situation was on a new level. Earlier this year, Mexican president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador appointed C\u00e1mara to a Council for Cultural Diplomacy, and C\u00e1mara decided she would move back to Mexico City. Twenty-four hours after our lunch, she\u2019d be in Mexico City looking for a new school for her 10-year-old son.C\u00e1mara doesn\u2019t quite know what she\u2019ll actually do in Mexico City. The government appointment made multiple headlines, but in retrospect they were all premature. \u201cEverybody is so excited about this that they insist on making it bigger,\u201d C\u00e1mara said, rolling her eyes. When asked exactly what her governmental duties will be, she threw her hands up. \u201cWho knows? I don\u2019t know.\u201d (She did say she's planning a food festival in Mexico City for 2020.)Nevertheless, she is leaving California, a change that neither she nor Koslow anticipated when they agreed to work together. Over lunch, she spun this as a positive development. \u201cI\u2019m really happy to be letting go of certain things,\u201d she said, though she did not elaborate on which things exactly.Talking to C\u00e1mara is like playing a game of Space Invaders\u2014the thoughts come all at once, faster and faster until you give up trying to catch them all. As she talked, she took bites of Koslow\u2019s food. We\u2019d accidentally ordered two of Sqirl\u2019s greatest hits: the sorrel bowl and an inch-and-a-half-thick slice of toasted brioche spread with nut butter and jam. If she were any good at social media, she\u2019d take a photo and post it, she said. I pointed out that Contramar has its own Instagram stars: the much-copied tuna tostada and the grilled snapper, which is served butterflied and painted with red salsa on one half, green on the other.\u201cI know certain things that do work and certain things that I intuitively know will not work,\u201d C\u00e1mara said. \u201cAnd I feel that Jessica and I meet at that point. We really want to make something that\u2019s popular.\u201dStill, she said, looking at the food on the table, \u201cI think that Onda\u2019s going to be a little too hipster for me.\u201dAn hour later, Koslow, C\u00e1mara, and various members of their teams sat in Koslow\u2019s office, a sweeping white space above Sqirl that also functions as a photo studio. The subject of the meeting: timelines. The hotel wants its signature restaurant, Koslow explained. And the current timeline they were working with had the kitchen becoming available just a few days before the restaurant opened to the public.C\u00e1mara saw disaster. \u201cWe need much more time than that,\u201d she said. Her chatty energy was now leaning toward agitation. She pointed out that Onda took first place on Eater LA\u2019s Most Anticipated Restaurants of Summer list. (A few months later, still unopened, Onda would make the fall list too.) \u201cWe cannot mess this up.\u201dAcross from C\u00e1mara, Koslow responded by sitting upright in her chair, blinking purposively, and speaking to the table in the soft, calming tones of a second grade school teacher. A few days later, Koslow would describe this to me as her duck mode, \u201cwhere you don\u2019t know that my feet are moving really fast underneath.\u201d Overhearing this from across the room, Sqirl\u2019s creative director, Scott Barry, offered a correction. \u201cDuck\u201d is too mellow, he says. Koslow is more like a full jungle. (\u201cFrom overhead, a jungle is quiet.\u201d)\u201cThere\u2019s no chill,\u201d Koslow agrees. \u201cLike, no chill.\u201dIf you know where to look, you can see Koslow\u2019s jungle at work. At the meeting, her toe nervously tapped the air at a steady EDM pulse. And as the meeting went on and anxieties about opening dates and kitchen layouts were expelled, Koslow surreptitiously started replying to emails on her laptop while still managing to make eye contact with people in the room so that they felt heard.Koslow is used to meetings like this. In early 2018, after two years of planning, designing, and talking to the press, Koslow\u2019s anticipated second restaurant, Tel, fell apart after its main investor abruptly pulled out. Slated to be an all-day restaurant, art space, and bagel bakery, Tel would have been something of a stake in the ground for Koslow\u2014proof that she can do more than breakfast and grain bowls, that she can be successful more than a seven-minute drive from her home on the Eastside.\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of questions in people\u2019s heads about whether Jessica Koslow can open a dinner restaurant,\u201d Koslow says. \u201cAnd maybe that was a question in my own head.\u201d The stakes she felt at Tel are now the stakes of Onda, and the goal is the same: It\u2019s about taking on the entire city, not just her corner of it. It\u2019s about being a chef in Los Angeles, not just a chef in Silver Lake. It\u2019s about giving the city something they haven\u2019t seen before: \u201ca new food for Los Angeles,\u201d as she describes it.As Onda continued to get pushed back, from a summer opening to the fall, Koslow and Orozco, Onda\u2019s chef de cuisine, worked on the fritto misto. \u201cI can\u2019t have dishes on this menu feel \u2018basic\u2019 and \u2018normal\u2019 under any circumstances,\u201d Koslow told the chef. C\u00e1mara, who wanted the fritto misto in the first place, was not around. Between July and September, Koslow says, C\u00e1mara was rarely in Los Angeles. The restaurant that is \u201cnot Mexican but rooted in Mexican food\u201d has had to more or less move forward without one of its roots.It was always understood that the partnership between the two women would not necessarily be equal; C\u00e1mara never pretended that she would move to L.A. But everybody thought that C\u00e1mara would be a 90-minute trip away, not a four-hour flight that involves going through customs. The move to Mexico\u2014and the stress of packing up her life so that she could move\u2014meant that many of the most crucial decisions about the restaurant, everything from who will work at Onda to what they will wear, fell on Koslow.\u201cThe reality is that this is more of a consultancy,\u201d C\u00e1mara told me a few weeks ago. There was a hesitancy in her voice, and I didn\u2019t know if it was because she wasn\u2019t sure how much to reveal about her role, or if she was unsure herself what that role is. When I asked if she saw herself doing more consultancies of this nature, she sounded almost pained.\u201cI know many chefs do restaurants in hotels and consult that way, and I know it\u2019s a global tendency for quote-unquote star chefs to put their faces to projects that they aren\u2019t necessarily close to physically. But, I don\u2019t know...we\u2019ll see. If you\u2019re asking me if I have a project opening in Dubai, Vegas, and Hong Kong? No.\u201dIn June, when C\u00e1mara mentioned Onda on a podcast with David Chang, she described it as \u201cin a hotel\u2014talk about corporate.\u201d Later in that same podcast, she was audibly annoyed when she admitted that Onda would have to handle the food in the hotel\u2019s lobby. (Executives from the hotel heard the podcast and immediately texted Koslow, asking what C\u00e1mara\u2019s problem was.)But if one of Onda\u2019s restaurateurs is uncomfortable with going global, the other is leaning in. In the next 12 months, Koslow will not just open Onda, but also Sqirl Away, a to-go version of Sqirl that she is opening with Sophie McNally, the daughter of restaurateur Keith McNally, in East Hollywood. She will also expand the original Sqirl with a wine shop and take-away counter, and she will release her next cookbook, The Sqirl Jam Book, in July. She is matter-of-fact about her ambitions to bring Sqirl global; she describes Sqirl Away as being intentionally scalable, and compares it to Pret A Manger, the British sandwich chain that now has almost 500 locations in Hong Kong, Europe, and the U.S. \u201cA big thing that I always say is that in order to keep a restaurant sustainable, you have to feed your neighborhood,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd you have to feed the world.\u201d So while Koslow opened with Proper because she saw an opportunity to make another neighborhood restaurant, it would not be out of the question for her to open in Proper Hotels in Santa Cruz or Boston or Minneapolis\u2014you could see Koslow opening a \u201cneighborhood restaurant\u201d in every neighborhood in the country.Last night Onda opened with fritto misto on the menu. But it isn\u2019t called fritto misto. Instead it\u2019s listed as \u201cFish Hiding In Kelp,\u201d a pretty straightforward description of a dish that is mostly seaweed and Meyer lemons that have been battered in house-made masa and fried with fried chunks of anchovies and other small fish nestled here and there. It appears on a menu alongside jackfruit that\u2019s been tossed in a 54-ingredient mole and piled onto a sope. And a quesadilla that is served inside-out, a house-made tortilla tucked inside an envelope of crispy cheese. And a chocolate molten cake spiked with canela (Mexican cinnamon) and chile that is so molten it\u2019s basically pudding, served with a salted orange-whey ice cream. And a pig ear salad that C\u00e1mara says \u201ccould be Mexican or could be Vietnamese or could be Thai.\u201dKoslow and I talked again last week, a few days before Onda opened for friends and family. She described the restaurant as a child. \u201cIt really needs to develop, just like any child does. So we\u2019re in the biggest growth period, trying to figure it out.\u201dThere was relief in Koslow\u2019s voice\u2014she was proud of her child\u2014but she admitted that menu development had not been easy. \u201cThere was a lot of failure,\u201d she said. The ambition was to make every dish feel like an L.A.\u2013Mexico City collaboration, but what Onda ended up with is a menu of recognizably Koslow-style food that looks to C\u00e1mara for inspiration\u2014and sometimes finds it. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we started out trying to do, but it's what ended up happening,\u201d Koslow said.Koslow and C\u00e1mara still use the word borderless when they talk about Onda; they still describe it as a place where the food veers from California to Mexico and back. But over the summer, as Onda took shape, the central conceit of the restaurant evolved. It\u2019s no longer just about the style of two restaurateurs or two cities, but about finding a style that transcends them. Koslow was still looking for that voice when she called me from the restaurant. \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d she asked herself out loud. \u201cWhat does it mean to be Onda?\u201dEditor: Amanda Shapiro, Photography: Alex Lau, Prop Styling: Julie Ho, Creative Direction & Design: Michele Outland, Chris Cristiano, and Christa Guerra, Production: Aliza Abarbanel and Michelle Heimerman, Social: Rachel Karten, Copy & Research: Brian Carroll and Susan Sedman, Special thanks to: Carey Polis and Adam Rapoport.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishLos AngelesChefssqirlessayRead MoreLifestyleWe Left Our Dream Jobs to Open a Restaurant Across the Country.
