And then he taught me some more.By Marissa A. RossJuly 10, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by George WylesolFacebookTwitterEmailHe said it out of nowhere, in the same stern tone he used to dictate fermentation processes or to tell someone where to park: \u201cYou should make wine.\u201d I searched his face in the patio light for any sign of humor. It was April 2018 in Abruzzo, Italy, nearly a year to the day since I\u2019d met him. After he said it, he didn\u2019t curl a lip or crack a smile. There wasn\u2019t even a nose twitch. As far as I could tell, Danilo Marcucci was carved of the same Umbrian limestone that lay beneath his vineyards. And he was serious.Marcucci refers to himself as \u201ca simple Umbrian man,\u201d but in the world of natural wine, he is a master. He has 13 vintages under his belt. He\u2019s a consultant for nearly a dozen wineries scattered across the country\u2014from outside Rome to Trento in the Alps. He is prolific, methodical, and idealistic. And I\u2019m an unruly wine columnist who writes nonsensical tasting notes that could be ripped straight from a Lewis Carroll book.\u201cOh, come on!\u201d I crowed, throwing back my glass of sparkling Grechetto with a smile. He once asked me to hoe weeds at his winery in Ceppaiolo, and I lasted about 45 seconds. He knew my hands were soft and useless. But again, he didn\u2019t laugh. I explained how I respected winemakers too much to make wine myself. I didn\u2019t know anything about farming. I couldn\u2019t make wine. \u201cYou have the taste, the mind, the philosophy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rest I can teach you.\u201dI shook my head and rolled my eyes. Marcucci tapped his fist on the table. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI was mistaken. I thought you were strong, but you are weak.\u201d Without hesitation, my right hand shot up, index finger pointed. \u201cHold on. I\u2019m not weak,\u201d I spit, the wine rushing to my ego. I finished my glass before pouring myself another for no reason but dramatic effect. I leaned back with my chest puffed and there it was. Marcucci was finally smiling (slightly). He knew he had pushed the right button.\u201cI\u2019m not so sure,\u201d he shrugged, gathering his belongings. He left me on the patio.The author and her Jedi wine master at Tiberi vineyards in Umbria.\nPhoto Courtesy of Marissa A. RossOne year earlier I had never heard of Danilo Marcucci. I was in a van, tracing the white- flowered countryside of Abruzzo on the way to Vini Rabasco, when I first learned his name. I was surprised to learn Marcucci was not only the head winemaker of the beloved Vini Conestabile but also the head consultant\u2014or as he says, \u201ccollaborator\u201d\u2014on many of my favorite Italian wines. The Rabasco \u201cCancelli\u201d Montepulciano I had compared to a Fellini character\u2014archetypal yet complex, simple yet so damn sensual. The Furlani Sur Lie Alpino Macerato, a sparkling Pinot Grigio, that was so good my only note was just a big cursive scribble that read \u201cAll the feelings!!!\u201d Marcucci was behind it all\u2014the humble guru hiding in the shadows of a galaxy far, far away and the opinionated vigilante plotting from the caverns below his castle. He\u2019s the Yoda of Italian natural wine. Or maybe the Batman.Technically, his castle is a manor in Monte Melino in Perugia. More technically, it belongs to his wife, the Countess Alessandra Conestabile della Staffa. Regardless, it has legitimate bats, and he drives a black Audi A6 Avant that could be mistaken for a low-key Batmobile. He looks the part too, magically appearing just as he is needed, with crossed arms, furrowed brows, and salt-and-pepper hair, always in a perfectly tailored shirt whether he is in the vineyard or out to dinner. He is shrewd and serious, speaking slowly in low-toned phrases that come out like profound poetry in his broken English.I was endlessly fascinated by him but also a little afraid. Most men who are that serious about anything have little patience for me. I\u2019m a five-foot-four woman with a ten-foot personality who exudes equal amounts of anxiety and ego, who chatters excitedly and is prone to passionate fits about everything from the Beatles to who are these people who wear just their socks into airplane bathrooms. But I elicit a particular brand of contempt from men who are that serious about wine. Behind my back they talk about how I\u2019m ruining wine by drinking straight from the bottle on Instagram. To my face they say things like \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to taste. But if you take off your shirt, I\u2019ll teach you.\u201d And they never forget to tell me it\u2019s \u201ccute\u201d that I wrote a 300-page book about wine, as if it didn\u2019t require any hard work or skill.But I wouldn\u2019t let that stop me from learning everything I could from this Marcucci character. On this visit he guided a group of us through his wines. I asked a billion questions, elbowed my way to the front of every tasting, and sprinted down four flights of stairs after eating three pounds of pasta to clarify his position on using volcanic sulfur to protect against powder mold in the vineyard. When I sat shotgun while he sped through Spoleto, I swallowed the lump in my throat and asked if I could come back to really study his work. I braced myself, waiting for this very serious wine man to say I should stick to drinking in bikinis.Marcucci in his Conestabile Della Staffa vineyards in Umbria, discussing the changing climate of Italy.\nPhoto Courtesy of Marissa A. RossInstead, Marcucci gave me a seat at a table I\u2019d never been invited to. Without taking his eyes off the road, he said, \u201cScared of the light of success, I did all of my work in the shadows.\u201d Because what else would Yoda/Batman say. When he did turn to me, he offered to host me in Italy later that summer to learn.I returned in August 2017, the once vacant vines now bursting with vibrant green leaves. I listened as Marcucci delivered sermons about the importance of minerality and diversified agriculture. I watched as he coated 30-year-old Cabernet Franc rootstock in wax to graft it with Aleatico. Under the canopy of Montepulciano vines, drooping with grapes that looked nearly navy blue under their hazy coats of native yeast, Marcucci taught me how to measure sugar and inspect seeds for acidity. Every grape, every plant, every rock is individually assessed\u2014and celebrated\u2014for its part of the whole.Marcucci lives by a strict code of winemaking: no chemicals in the vineyard, no technology in the cellar. But \u201cno technology\u201d doesn\u2019t mean he pumps his juice into a Crock-Pot and lets whatever happens happen. Working strictly with spontaneous fermentation\u2014where a wine begins fermentation naturally without added yeast\u2014he is attentive and attuned to his wines, living within the small intersection of science and spirituality. He tried to illustrate the process through diagrams, but they left us sighing. You cannot chart when wines should be racked if you\u2019re deciding by how they smell on that day. Nor can you articulate when a wine is just bitter enough that you should jump into a 1,000-liter vat and pull out the green seeds by hand. That takes true connection.One day we were driving to his newest project, Vini di Giovanni, when Marcucci announced, \u201cToday, we harvest.\u201d Much like polar bears and coral reefs, the traditional harvest season in Italy has been thrown off-balance by climate change\u2014we were a month ahead of schedule. I was unprepared in a tank top and shorts but thankful I\u2019d remembered my Flonase.Marcucci handed me a pair of clippers and a crate. I dug my bare knees into the long grass and thistles, the rocky soil covered in dead branches and prickly weeds. I could sense the hives running up and down my legs, but it didn\u2019t matter. I felt connected to wine in a way I never had before.I started writing about wine because it was transportive. I couldn\u2019t afford to travel in my 20s, but with a bottle of wine, I could close my eyes and be in Sicily or Santorini. It allowed me to experience places I\u2019d never been. I could smell them, taste them, live through them. And now here I was actually in Umbria, with the smell of crushed red grapes on my shirt, the dirt I loved to taste under my nails, and hives all over my calves.After the Ciliegiolo was picked, we walked up the rolling hills to Vini di Giovanni\u2019s tiny cellar. It had two steel tanks, two vats, and an old wooden winepress. Marcucci strapped on a rubber apron. \u201cWash this down, drag that hose there, bring those crates here,\u201d he instructed. Floods of coral juice poured out of the press into vats along with a pied de cuve, a native yeast starter. Marcucci mixed the pied de cuve into the juice with the full length of his arm, then rested and stared into the frothy abyss. We tested the levels, then went in for a lunch of homemade ricotta and other homemade stuff, but mostly homemade ricotta. By the time we finished, the Ciliegiolo had started fermenting.The afterparty\u2014and aftermath\u2014of SelectioNaturel's portfolio tasting in Umbria.\nPhoto Courtesy of Marissa A. RossMarcucci continued to teach me. Before I left we tried wines of the masters who had influenced him. A 2004 \u201cJakot\u201d revealed stories of how winemaker Stanko Radikon made Marcucci aspire to be a revolutionary. A 1986 Lino Maga Barbacarlo explained Marcucci\u2019s quest to defend terroir. Back in Los Angeles, I\u2019d send long emails about bottle aging and other geeky wine stuff I can\u2019t believe I care about almost ten years after I first reviewed Two Buck Chuck on YouTube as a joke. In Paris after the spring wine fairs, we got into a screaming match about carbonic maceration over a 2005 Morgon. It didn\u2019t matter if I was listening like an eager schoolgirl, conversing like a professional peer, or arguing like a Sicilian (as Marcucci says), he always respected me. He asked my opinion, listened in return, and let me fight him as passionately as he\u2019d fight me.Alone on that patio in Abruzzo, I didn\u2019t know what to do with Marcucci\u2019s suggestion. Could I make my own wine? I shook away his compliments about how I had the taste and mind, but that\u2019s why he had pulled up that seat for me. That\u2019s why he had put that time into teaching me. He gave me confidence in a world that tried to strip it from me. And he\u2019s Yoda/Batman.The next day we were at a Selectio Naturel tasting in Umbria, trying all my favorites\u2014Rabasco! Furlani! And a new winery, Vini di Giovanni, with a wine called the \u201cCiliegiozzo Frizzante\u201d Ciliegiolo. Its first fermentation was in an open vat for ten days before being aged in fiberglass. Its second fermentation started under a crescent moon and had been aging in bottle one month. There were only 650 bottles made. It was the color of ruby red grapefruit glistening in the sun. It smelled like roses that are barely peeling open, raspberry, and thyme and literally tickled your nose with the spice of pink peppercorns. It tasted like microbial fireworks of cranberry that pop as fast and steady as a racing heart near a crush, and that Umbrian dirt I cleaned from under my nails with my teeth.\u201cIt\u2019s your wine!\u201d Marcucci said, smiling. I rolled my eyes and laughed. I had picked some grapes, moved some crates, pulled some hoses. We both knew that was not winemaking; that was mostly me eating ricotta. I swallowed the lump in my throat. \u201cBut really, when can I come make wine?\u201d\u201cWhenever,\u201d he said, as serious as ever. \u201cYou are very strong.\u201dMarissa A.
