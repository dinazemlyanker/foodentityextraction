Heat a large ovenproof skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high. Cook bell peppers in skillet, turning every minute or two, until blistered in several spots, about 5 minutes. (You aren\u2019t trying to cook them, just get some color on them.) Transfer bell peppers to a cutting board and let cool slightly; reserve skillet. Stand a pepper upright and slice off sides, working your way around stem in 3 or 4 cuts. Pull out ribs and seeds; discard along with stems. Repeat with remaining peppers.Step 2Return peppers to skillet and add shallot, chile, and 3 thyme sprigs. Season generously with salt and black pepper and drizzle \u00bc cup oil over.

Other spices to consider on the outside would be a good smoked paprika, or maybe some cumin and turmeric. dwilkinsboise2581Boise9/18/2020Make this at least once a month. One of my fave recipes in the last few years from BA!AnonymousBrooklyn12/9/2019I make a recipe which is very similar to this, only thing missing in my opinion, is some garlic cloves. Great idea to add a jalepeno pepper to the mix!AnonymousOrange county, Ca9/23/2018Easy delicious weeknight dinner.  Use a kitchen torch to char the peppers, rather than the skillet method: better char, less time.  Leftover chicken and peppers make a great sandwich.  \nstanmPhiladelphia 8/27/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titAmericanBell PepperVegetableChickenPoultryFresno ChileChileWeeknight MealsEasyMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeHealthyishRoastDinnerRecipes you want to make.
