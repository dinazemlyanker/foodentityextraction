So much so that I can often be found at my desk, wrapped in a blanket while typing away on my computer. And often in my hand is a mug of tea.This isn\u2019t just any mug, though. It\u2019s a glass 12-ounce Keep Cup, an item that I have grown inordinately attached to during the work day. It seems as if it was designed specifically for my hands (which, in the scheme of things, are pretty \u201cnormal\u201d hands\u2026). It\u2019s just the right size to fit a hot drink of single-serving proportions.I get it\u2014the Keep Cup looks\u2026 rather perfunctory. Glass cup, one-inch thick cork band, plastic lid with an opening to sip from. But each aspect is designed perfectly: The glass never fogs up and is easy to clean, the cork is super soft and comfortable to the touch, and the lid has the right size slit for drinking without spilling all over yourself. And, there\u2019s a plastic lever that allows you to close the opening to keep your beverage hot when you aren\u2019t drinking it\u2014and from scalding yourself as you carry it around from meeting to meeting.You know how people get attached to mugs because they have some sort of sentimental value? Like, say, if you happen upon a Tina Turner museum in a one-room schoolhouse during a road trip? Obviously, you\u2019re gonna buy a souvenir mug (true story). The Keep Cup holds no such memories for me. It\u2019s sterile, and doesn\u2019t really have a ton of character. But it\u2019s engineered with the office tea drinker in mind, and for that alone it has made me happier than any other mug I\u2019ve owned.Should you decide that you need to possess one of your own, you can design a personalized cup in all sorts of colors. Perhaps go for a way less boring option than I did, and channel a little of that Tina moxie while you\u2019re at it. Sadly, though, there\u2019s no sequin option\u2026 yet.Buy it: Keep Cup 12-oz Reusable Coffee Cup, $27 on AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
