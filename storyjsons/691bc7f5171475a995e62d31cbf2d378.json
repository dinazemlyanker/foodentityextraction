But what you get in return is more than worth it: innovative, genre-bending cuisine packed with flavor, and dishes you\u2019ll remember long after folding up your napkin.The restaurant empire, founded by chef David Chang, has been exalted by critics and beloved by diners since Momofuku Noodle Bar began it all in NYC\u2019s East Village in 2004. In the highly competitive NYC restaurant world, you don\u2019t stand out by following the rules...and Chang never has.When it opened in 2008, Chang\u2019s rebellious tasting menu concept, Momofuku Ko, also required a fair amount of compromise on the diner\u2019s part.For one thing, you had to book your seats through an online system that was instantaneously inundated and nearly impossible to penetrate. You became very familiar with your laptop\u2019s refresh button (and the limits of your own patience) in the process.Once you made it inside, you were dining in a small bar-like space, barely an arm\u2019s length from the chefs who were preparing your food, right in front of you. It was refined, yet scrappy. The tasting menu was relatively affordable at $85 a head and the vibe was casual, complete with a heady rock & roll soundtrack.It\u2019s become a bit easier to gain access to the Ko experience, after a relocation to a larger, swankier, address in 2014, although prices have increased.Photo by Heidi's BridgePhoto by Heidi's BridgeAt Ko\u2019s upgraded space, the bar/open kitchen counter is in the center, with plenty of room to spare for the diner, and lined with artwork by David Choe. All eyes are still on the chefs who are working inside a U-shaped bar counter/open kitchen, surrounded with seats. This level of visibility is still relatively unique, although not rare, especially with the prevalence of omakase sushi spots all over the city.The dining room at Momofuku Ko.\nPhoto by Heidi's BridgeBut David Chang\u2019s rebel ethos is softening a bit with age; he reopened Chelsea\u2019s Momofuku Nishi last fall with more comfortable non-backless chairs, for example. And in 2015, he opened a low-priced, fast-casual concept called Fuku that even delivers, giving more diners the chance to try his food at their own convenience.At Ko, concessions have recently been made as well, some might say, with the recent reconcepting of a former office and storage area into a bar/test kitchen next door. Executive chef Sean Gray and GM Su Wong Ruiz designed it along with Richard Lewis Architects, the same firm behind NYC restaurants like Agern, Indian Accent and Via Carota.The revamped space offers much more flexibility for both the chefs and for diners. \u201cOriginally, this was going to be just a bar and lounge,\u201d says Gray, \u201cbut we really needed a test kitchen so we decided to make it both.\u201d Here you can walk in (beginning at 3:00 p.m.) and order drinks and dishes which rotate weekly (and sometimes daily).What Gray means by \u201ctest kitchen\u201d is a place in which to try out new dishes (on diners) for the Ko main dining room menu\u2014something of a nightly focus group if you will. Then, he can tweak and perfect them before they appear on the Ko tasting menu. Everything from a quadruple-fried chicken leg to a sourdough crepe (with or without caviar) to whatever Gray feels like playing with that day is fair game for guests who serve as his culinary guinea pigs.Secret storage underneath banquette seating in the bar.\nPhoto by Heidi's BridgeDiners at the bar seats also have front row access to the chefs\u2014and all of their equipment. High-end items like a fancy German bread oven (the kind they use at \u201creal bakeries like Tartine\u201d according to Gray), two built-in induction burners and a Konro grill fueled by binchotan charcoal are juxtaposed with more everyday items like a basic rice cooker and a wine fridge that \u201ccost less than $100 on Amazon,\u201d according to Ruiz.There are no defined stations behind the bar counter. \u201cThe food at the bar is changing all the time,\u201d according to Gray, \u201cso it\u2019s set up to be very fluid and not super structured.\u201d The dish area for the bar is self-contained in an attached space for convenience. Gray, Ruiz, a line cook or whoever, will all take turns acting as dishwasher throughout the night.The objects that Ko chooses to display are carefully curated. In the main dining space, refrigerators accessible from both the kitchen and dining room showcase dry-aged steaks as well as plates and other kitchenware, neatly organized with presentation in mind. Peek-a-boo shelving runs in a U-shape above the open kitchen counter, high above the centerpiece of the action displaying select spices and dry goods. A stack of labeled spices neatly resides in the bar corner against the wall that abuts the bar room, often monochromatic in color scheme.Photo by Heidi's BridgeMinimalism presides in the new bar area (as it does throughout the Momofuku empire), which Gray and Ruiz say draws design inspiration from artists Donald Judd, Dan Flavin and the movie, Bladerunner. At the tables, you\u2019ll find hidden drawers that pull out seatside to house cutlery, admittedly inspired by similar tables at Relae in Copenhagen, according to Ruiz. Pull open the leather banquette seat beneath you and you\u2019ll find storage cabinets hiding underneath as well, laden with back issues of Lucky Peach magazine (among other things).Photo by Heidi's BridgePerhaps most striking in the new bar area are the library-style LED lights, made by California design company, Koncept, that swivel to the chef\u2019s will. Low-back bar chairs are made by Token, who also provided the artwork for the test kitchen, and designed the tables and chairs in the dining room.The window that connects the bar to the dining room.\nPhoto by Heidi's BridgeMost fun is the window/panel in the wall between the dining room and bar, which opens and closes to connect the two spaces and pass drinks through. \u201cWhen we were setting up the new space we asked ourselves, \u2018how will we get drinks back and forth?\u201d says Ruiz. This was their answer. Plus it adds a fun element of surprise for diners, who if they peer closely, can see through to the main dining room when the window opens.Despite all of the sleek, playful design and high-end equipment, the real theater at Ko is in watching the chefs. And the centerpiece is what\u2019s happening on the plate, with new audiences now able to more easily peek their heads in and catch a glimpse of the show.Executive chef Sean Gray and GM Su Wong Ruiz\nPhoto by Heidi's BridgeExplore Bon App\u00e9titMomofuku KoNew YorkRestaurants + TravelRecipes you want to make.
