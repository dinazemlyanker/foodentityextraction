While a cold draft beer is a fine choice, cooking of this caliber really demands good sake. Plus, you get to pick your own tiny cup to drink from, which is even better than choosing your favorite Monopoly piece.ORDER THE: sashimi to start, picking at least a few from the daily specials, which feature peak ingredients. The yakitori is also a popular option. But only amateurs would tank up on proteins and cheat themselves out of the rice, which is the best\u2014and last\u2014part of the meal: One of Ifuu\u2019s most famous specialties is a giant donabe of hot rice that has been steamed with a flotilla of uni on top.THE VIBE IS: spare but warm, like eating dinner in a Muji advertisement. The bottom floor is a brightly lit room where the chefs bustle about the open kitchen and the bulk of the seating is at a counter. There are tables for bigger groups upstairs, though you\u2019ll still want to call ahead if you have a party of more than four.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Monday through Saturday from 5:30 p.m. to midnight. Closed on Sundays and some holidays. Little English is spoken by the staff, but the menu will list the regular offerings in English. Specials are not usually translated, but try your best to ask for recommendations. Reservations recommended. The nearest subway station is Naka-Meguro.Photo by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneThe peak-season sashimi is listed on the daily specials menu.\nPhoto by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneYou can\u2019t go wrong with the yakitori.\nBy Kee Byung-keunExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
