When slicing the chicken, don\u2019t be alarmed if the meat isn\u2019t bright white and has a hint of pink to it. It\u2019s completely cooked and is in fact pasteurized, that is, very safe to eat! Read more about what sous vide cooking is, and see how to cook anything sous vide with step-by-step photos here.Ingredients2 servings2skinless, boneless chicken breasts (1\u20131 \u00bd pounds total)Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper\u2153cup store-bought or homemade pestoSpecial EquipmentA sous vide machine; a 1-gallon vacuum-sealable or resealable plastic bagPreparationStep 1Clip (or stand) sous vide machine to a tall, large pot. Fill pot with warm water to height according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions (keep in mind that chicken when added will cause water to rise).Step 2Season chicken lightly with salt and pepper. Place chicken in bag and add pesto; turn to coat.Photo by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Anna BillingskogStep 3Vacuum-seal or partially close resealable bag, getting as much air out as possible to keep bag from floating, and place in water bath. If using a resealable plastic bag, push down into water to submerge (this will push more air out of the bag) and fully close. To ensure proper cooking, contents of the bag need to be completely submerged in water. Turn on machine and heat water to 145\u00b0.Step 4Using a small clip, secure top edge of resealable bag to rim of pot, positioning it opposite of the machine\u2019s water outlet; as the water circulates, it will help keep the bag submerged. If using a vacuum-sealed bag, you may need to set a small plate on top to prevent floating. Cook chicken, maintaining water bath at 145\u00b0, 2\u00bd hours. Remove bag from water bath and let chicken rest in bag 10 minutes (this lets the chicken absorb some of the juices).Step 5Transfer chicken to a cutting board and slice. Serve with pesto cooking liquid (it makes for a great sauce to go with chicken, especially tossed with some pasta).Step 6Do Ahead: Chicken can be cooked in water bath 4 days ahead. Keep sealed in bag and chill, or freeze up to 1 month. Enjoy cold or reheat with sous vide machine at 100\u00b0 until warmed through, about 1 hour, before serving.How would you rate Sous Vide Chicken with Pesto?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (3)Back to TopTriangleAfter an exhausted day, I googled \u201ceasy chicken breast recipe,\u201d and I\u2019m so glad I found this one. Popped it in the sous vide with store bought pesto plus S&p, and served it some pan fried polenta. Very pleased. Would make again!JuliaLos Angeles, ca2/21/2021This is not a good recipe. The chicken releases a ton of liquid when it cooks which waters down the pesto to nothing. Much better off applying pesto after cookingKjanusDenver3/13/2019Super easy with great taste. juicy.AnonymousHouston9/20/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titChicken BreastChickenPoultryMainGluten-FreeKetoDinnerRecipes you want to make.
