She\u2019s a \u201cHood Politician.\u201dThe founder and CEO of Slutty Vegan ATL is using her growing burger chain\u2019s success to care for her community and get out the vote.By Aisha \u201cPinky\u201d Cole, as told to Leigh-Ann JacksonOctober 13, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailphoto by Emma FishmanFacebookTwitterEmailAisha \u201cPinky\u201d Cole is the founder and CEO of Slutty Vegan ATL, a vegan restaurant chain that frequently draws hours-long lines for its plant-based fast food, like burgers made with soy protein and topped with vegan cheese, vegan shrimp tossed in Buffalo sauce, and sweet jerk plantains sandwiched in a Hawaiian bun.She started making her signature bawdy burgers, like the \u201cOne Night Stand\u201d and the \u201cM\u00e9nage \u00e0 Trois,\u201d in a shared kitchen in 2018 before launching a food truck later that year. Cole has since opened two brick-and-mortar locations in the Atlanta area and is preparing to open a third in the Edgewood neighborhood this month.Cole describes the restaurants\u2019 vibe as raucous and \u201cSix Flags-ish,\u201d but philanthropy is also a big part of her brand. Her Pinky Cole Foundation has created scholarship funds for students enrolled at her HBCU alma mater, Clark Atlanta University. She\u2019s donated everything from laptops to haircuts to fresh produce to the surrounding communities. And after Rayshard Brooks was fatally shot by an APD officer in June, she donated a car and life insurance policies to his family and covered college tuition fees for his children.Cole\u2019s newest initiative is Votenik 2020: Zoom the Polls, a weekly digital series of conversations aiming to increase voter turnout nationwide.Here, Cole explains how her mother inspired her altruism, how her community informed her activism, and how she wants to motivate others to vote. \u2013Leigh-Ann JacksonMy mother is from Jamaica. She came to this country when she was 17. Once she got here, she met my dad and\u2014long story short\u2014he ended up doing 22 years in prison. She was always working two or three jobs and letting people from Jamaica come stay in our house until they got on their feet. So there were always six to 10 people living with us. If somebody needed money, she would give them money. We sacrificed presents on holidays so that she could help other people.At the time, I didn\u2019t understand it. But I appreciate it now, because I am just like that. I will help anybody. And that\u2019s pretty much the reason why I started the Pinky Cole Foundation.The goal of my foundation is to provide opportunities and financial literacy resources to people to help bridge the generational wealth gap. I\u2019ve paid the rents of local business owners in the middle of the pandemic. I partnered with the Department of Juvenile Justice to employ ex-juvenile offenders at Slutty Vegan. I\u2019m partnering with a local halfway house so we can give them work opportunities as well.It feels good to be able to help my young Black brothers because I know how it feels to be a part of the system. No, I wasn\u2019t behind bars, but I was on the other side of that. To get that automated voice saying, \u201cYou have a collect call from\u2026\u201d Me hearing those calls\u2014I should probably go to therapy because of it. As a young kid, I was not able to physically touch my father unless I went through a whole bunch of security guards. We would sit and talk for an hour before the buzzer went off. Having been a part of that system, I don\u2019t wish that on my worst enemy.Now, as an adult, I\u2019m going to use my resources so that I can help as many young Black men get out of the system early so that they don\u2019t end up going down that path where they make bad decisions and look up one day like, \u201cDamn, what happened with my life?\u201d And I think that more business owners should take the responsibility to do that, especially if they are in urban communities.We also donate meals to people who need them, whether that\u2019s homeless people, teachers, first responders, or essential workers. We want to make sure that those people are good because those are the people who really make our world go around. And we\u2019re putting Slutty Vegan locations in underserved communities and food deserts because we want to give that level of food access for people. We want to create a space where people feel like they have options, especially in inner-city communities. If you go to your local grocery store in an inner-city community, the fruit that you see there is not going to look like the fruit that you see in Beverly Hills.So we\u2019ve been able to step in and show them a healthier alternative. And we\u2019re educating them on how important it is to have food access and to understand what you\u2019re eating. Yes, it may be just burgers and fries, but it\u2019s vegan. It\u2019s not dead animals. And I\u2019m also going to roll out the healthier options\u2014salads, fresh drinks, and soup\u2014for when it gets cold. We\u2019re not telling you to go vegan; we\u2019re just telling you to open up your horizons.A Slutty Vegan burger, in all its glory\nPhoto by Emma FishmanIn the next two years, we\u2019re opening up another 13 locations. I\u2019m going to Alabama, L.A., South and North Carolina. I was supposed to open up my third location in Atlanta on July Fourth, but COVID is just a hater. It\u2019s thrown a monkey wrench in the program. We\u2019ve had to pivot with the foundation and the business. Sometimes pivots are okay because they allow us the opportunity to reset, restart, research, and get better. So, right now, we\u2019re focusing on the Votenik initiative.Votenik is a program to promote voter turnout. It\u2019s a weekly digital conversation about the election. We\u2019re talking about immigration issues, health care access, criminal justice reform, and gun reform. We really want to talk to the people who are not voting, the people who are not interested in voting or don\u2019t have the access or resources to figure out how to do it. And we\u2019re getting a surprise celebrity drop-in every single time. I reached out to Impossible Foods, then we looped [Atlanta-based rap mogul] Jermaine Dupri in. On Super Tuesday, we\u2019re doing a big celebration where we\u2019re going to be providing free meals for people who have shown that they\u2019ve voted. And I\u2019m encouraging people to exercise their right to vote on the local level, especially.Honestly\u2014and I\u2019m being totally transparent\u2014I think that Americans put too much emphasis on the President of the United States without looking at our community leaders and organizations who also make decisions that will directly affect us. Presidents are not gods. So I\u2019m starting with myself first. I was Miss Clark Atlanta University and back then my platform was \u201cSELFLESS: Setting an Example by Listening First, then Leading Everyone to a Standard of Success.\u201d I would use that as my platform if I was going to be a politician because it\u2019s really not about me. It\u2019s about how you pay it forward, how you give back and uplift the people around you.Now I call myself a \u201cHood Politician.\u201d I\u2019ve done more than some politicians have done in decades. And I\u2019m not saying that to be cocky, I\u2019m saying that to say that change starts from within. The change that we want to see? We literally can be that change. I know that whatever the outcome of this election is, I\u2019m going to be all right. It\u2019s not going to stop what I\u2019m doing for the community.Here are Cole\u2019s tips for making a difference in your own community this election season and beyond:1. Locate food deserts in your area, then support charities that increase access to healthy, affordable food in low-income areas, like the Food Empowerment Project.2. Donate to organizations that fund women-of-color-owned food and beverage businesses, like New Voices Fund.3. Discover, support, and amplify Black-owned restaurants by using apps, like Black and Mobile and Eat Okra.4. Bank Black\u2014investing in Black-owned banks means investing in Black communities. Black-owned banks offer the same services as larger institutions, but with more one-on-one customer service to guide Black restaurant owners through bookkeeping, payroll, and funding opportunities like PPP loans.5. Donate to the Pinky Cole Foundation, which funds financial literacy education and mentorship programs for teens and young adults nationwide, helping the fast-food workers of today become the entrepreneurs of tomorrow.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsFirst PersonRecipes you want to make.
