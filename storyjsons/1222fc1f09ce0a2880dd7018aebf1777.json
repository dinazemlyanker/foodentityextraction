Not once you start asking people the right way to make one. We talked to six chefs across the country about their particular methods for crafting the classic and they were as particular as you might expect. Here\u2019s how they do it:\u201cI always use soft bread\u2014milk bread or brioche\u2014then I spread cashew butter and strawberry preserves on each side. I like the chunky fruit. I sprinkle a little sea salt on the inside. That\u2019s it. My sandwich is not toasted, it still has the crusts, and, of course, it\u2019s cut diagonally because it\u2019s very important to have equal parts preserves and nut butter in each bite.\u201d \u2014Julia Jaksic, Cafe Roze, Nashville\u201cI get really good creamy peanut butter and, to give it some texture, I crush some plain peanuts for crunch. Then there\u2019s a layer of strawberry jam. I slice fresh strawberries over the top\u2014it heightens all the strawberry flavor and you get a nice contrast of sweet, acidic fruit. And then, for me, it\u2019s gotta be cut on a diagonal. That holds everything together the best as opposed to straight across. You can get good corner bites of a sandwich that are a little crusty.\u201d \u2014Peter Lemos, Wax Paper, Los AngelesStacks on stacks.\nPhoto by Alex Lau\u201cI like to slather on an equal proportion of crunchy peanut butter to jam on a country loaf (it helps that my husband is a bread master).  Crunchy peanut butter is important for a bit of textural contrast, and when it comes to the jam, I always reach for something with a good amount of acidity.  Apricot is my favorite.\u201d \u2014Elisabeth Prueitt, owner, Tartine Manufactory, San Francisco\u201cI\u2019m into Concord grape jelly and Skippy super chunk on thick-cut milk bread. I like it to squish a little bit. I build it so that both sides have peanut butter and then the jelly is in the middle. It\u2019s a more symmetrical bite and you\u2019re not getting any preserves leached onto one side of the bread.\u201d \u2014Tommy Habetz, Bunk Sandwiches, Portland, OR\u201cFor the perfect PB&J at my house, we always use potato bread because that\u2019s our favorite bread. I like to spread a little butter on the outside of the bread and toast it on a cast iron griddle\u2014just on one side\u2014so you get a Texas toast thing going on. There\u2019s a little crispiness but the inside is nice and soft. I like heavy amounts of organic unsweetened creamy peanut butter and strawberry jelly of equal portions, each on one side. And I\u2019m a whole sandwich kind of guy. I\u2019ll cut them in half at the restaurant for presentation, but at home it\u2019s about enjoying a good sandwich.\u201d \u2014John Bates, owner and chef, Noble Sandwich Co. in Austin\u201cI\u2019m a huge fan of spice so I mix a little sambal into my peanut butter. It reminds me of chicken satay. Then I add a few strips of bacon because I\u2019m indulgent, and blackberry jam. I like how all the flavors work together: salty, sweet, and fatty. I\u2019m not particular about the bread, but I do like having it toasty. Since I don\u2019t have a panini press at home, I put it in a pan, sit a brick covered in foil on top, and flip it. If I\u2019m being all fancy, I\u2019ll cut it in half, but usually when I make this I\u2019m standing over my sink.\u201d \u2014Casey Rebecca Nunes, chef, Media Noche, San FranciscoHow about a PB&J in pie form?Explore Bon App\u00e9titSandwichJellyPeanut ButterRead MorecookingWe Didn't Think PB+J Could Get Any Better Until We Made It Like ThisBy Chris MoroccocookingThis Is the Best Peanut Butter of All TimeBy Claire SaffitzcultureA Definitive Ranking of 23 Bonne Maman FlavorsBy Alyse WhitneyRecipes you want to make.
