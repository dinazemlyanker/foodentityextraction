He wakes up early, around 6:30 am, to sneak in some breathing exercises (right now, it\u2019s the Wim Hof method) and a quick sesh at the gym. Oh, AND a morning meditation with his team before their hectic days begin.Ratnam is the CEO of INDAY\u2014a group of three Indian-inspired, fast-casual restaurants in New York City. His work days are, well, intense: running the restaurants, building the business, sussing out new markets, and haggling for more retail space. (It\u2019s okay, weekends are more like tennis, reading, and eating.) We meet for pita at Dez\u2014a new mezze-heavy Middle Eastern spot in Soho from Eden Grinshpan and Sam Wasser. Ratnam wears dark blue khakis with a denim button-up, and is clearly right at home in the colorful, Marrakech-inspired space. It almost feels like we\u2019re on holiday, and I can\u2019t help but think, \u201cThis dude is so freaking chill.\u201d It\u2019s an adjective rarely synonymous with restaurateurs. But, for Ratnam, meditation and yoga were introduced at an early age. His mother, a psychology professor, wrote a book called, Spirit Versus Scalpel: Traditional Healing and Modern Psychotherapy. \u201cShe thought seriously about holistic health and wellness earlier on than most people,\u201d Ratnam says.INDAY's Cauli'fornia bowl features cauliflower rice and baked falafel with supergreens, tamarind chutney, garlic hummus, and pomegranate seeds.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigYou\u2019ll find this intention extended to INDAY\u2019s refreshing menu, which is rooted in the ancient Indian medical system of Ayurveda. INDAY\u2019s food is gluten, raw dairy, soy, and refined sugar free. \u201cWe try to avoid foods that cause inflammation or irritation, and cook everything from scratch,\u201d Ratnam says. In the summer, you\u2019ll find tons of cooling herbs and hydrating vegetables. In the fall and winter, it\u2019s warming spices and immunity boosters like turmeric and ginger. \u201cWe focus a lot on the season: not just what\u2019s coming out of the ground, but also what your body needs in relation to the environmental conditions.\u201dINDAY is a word Ratnam invented to reflect growing up Indian-American in a \u201cpretty white community.\u201d \u201cIt means India all day,\u201d he explains. \u201cIndia is a part of me but not all of me. And that\u2019s really the foundation at INDAY.\u201d Both of Ratnam\u2019s parents were born and raised in India, but because they\u2019re from different parts of the country (with very different cuisines and languages), western food became the common denominator at home. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t quite agree on the cuisine, so we ate a lot of Americanized stuff, since that\u2019s what me and my sister wanted,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt was interesting to grow up that way because I was always self-conscious hanging out with other Indian-Americans. It felt like I was a mixed-race kid, neither here nor there.\u201d For Ratnam, INDAY has been as much a path of cultural re-discovery as it has a thriving business venture.Ratnam\u2019s lunch usually happens in one of the three locations. If he\u2019s at the location in NoMad, he\u2019ll opt for their take on New York's classic street meat: Chicken and rice (organic long-grain basmati, antibiotic free grilled tandoori chicken, cucumber and tomato salad, homemade hot sauce, and coconut tahini). In Midtown, it\u2019s chicken curry over cauliflower rice. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on this curry recipe for three years,\u201d Ratnam says. \u201cIt\u2019s savory, sweet, umami, and spicy all at once, and there\u2019s no oil or dairy so it\u2019s super light and refreshing.\u201d If he\u2019s uptown, he\u2019ll grab a roti to go. \u201cIt\u2019s styled after a traditional kati roll, except we make our homemade bread out of coconut flour, chia seeds, organic masa, and coconut oil.\u201d Ratnam\u2019s filling of choice: Braised lamb with avocado. If he\u2019s not at INDAY for lunch, he loves abcV, Fairfax, Breads Bakery (\u201cI love the tuna salad!\u201d), Sweetgreen, and Kazunori (light on the rice).In the afternoon, Ratnam will reset his focus with some deep, diaphragmatic breathing. \u201cI do it whenever I find myself getting distracted,\u201d he says. \"Taking full breaths that fill the belly have been shown to cleanse the body, improve digestion, and lower stress hormones. Just a few minutes of this each morning, night, during a workout, or anywhere you can remember will work to keep the body in its slightly alkaline state.\u201d Speaking of working out, Ratnam does yoga or high-intensity interval training five or six days a week. After, he\u2019ll revive with INDAY\u2019s coconut cold brew: a combination of Nam Hom coconut water from Western Thailand and a custom low-acid coffee from Birch.Given the hours he works, dinners are not often home-cooked. For better or worse, INDAY is an extension of his life. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of everything I believe in, so it kind of goes with me wherever I go,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I do need better phone etiquette,\u201d he admits, as we finish the last bites of our cauliflower pitas before parting ways. \u201cI\u2019m trying to learn to be more present.\u201dCan\u2019t make it to INDAY? Give this chicken curry a whirl.Quick Tomato Chicken CurryThe honey lends a sweet, caramelize-y twist to this quick curry, but if you want to up the heat, add a big pinch of cayenne pepper. Have some thick, crusty bread handy to scoop up all the extra sauce, or serve alongside a pile of rice for a low-maintenance comfort food dinner.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishIndianNew YorkNew York CityprofileRead Morerestaurants13 Places to Eat Healthyish in NYCGallery13 SlidesBy Molly Young and The Healthyish TeamRecipes you want to make.
