Take it from cookbook author Cal Peternell, who is adamant when he says, \u201cUsing a salt shaker is a mistake.\u201dTo eliminate any over- or underseasoned cooking mishaps, you need a trusty salt cellar by your side. Reaching into a salt cellar and tangibly feeling how much salt you\u2019re grabbing is not only more reliable (every shaker shakes different!), but also hones your skills as a cook.\u00a0Over time you\u2019ll gain a more intuitive sense of how to season your food to your own liking\u2014two pinches of salt in three beaten eggs, a palmful in a pot of water for pasta, just a touch in the rice. (And not to reference a certain January 2017 meme, but there is something fun and dramatic about finishing up a meal with a flourish of the flaky stuff.)Creative Co-op Salt Glass$22 $19 at AmazonThere\u2019s no need to make a fancy splurgeeither.

Fine granules are tricky to grasp and likely stick to your fingers or make a mess.As one of the most frequently used ingredients in your kitchen, salt deserves to be in its own cozy home within easy reach, not relegated to an unceremonious corner in a shaker. Stock up on some quality salt, a nifty salt cellar, and get seasoning.Explore Bon App\u00e9titcookingShoppingRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
