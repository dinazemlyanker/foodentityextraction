However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.The harsh truth about deli containers\u2014yes, the same ones to which we\u2019ve taken a lifelong vow\u2014is that while they stack vertically, they actually waste a lot of space. It doesn\u2019t take a geometer (a real word, look it up!) to understand why square plastic containers can nestle together more snugly than containers with round sides.So when I recently moved into a new apartment, with the opportunity to reconfigure my pantry and fridge with space optimization in mind, I bought a set of square plastic containers. These have all the benefits of cylindrical deli containers\u2014lightweight; dishwasher-, microwave-, and freezer-safe; affordable but not disposable; clear, so you can see their contents; all lids match all bottoms\u2014they also nestle into my shelves almost like puzzle pieces. There's still some space left unused, but much less of it.They\u2019re in service in the fridge, where they hold small amounts of specialty flours, nuts, seeds, egg whites, lemon halves, leftover sauces, and leftover-leftovers. In the pantry they\u2019re filled with dried fruit, nutritional yeast, breadcrumbs, pulses, spice mixes, that little bit of lingering orzo I\u2019ve been meaning to boil. I also have a few on my desk, with Post-Its, paperclips, and other manners of whosits and whatsits. There\u2019s room for everything!Regarding their air-tightness, I wouldn\u2019t fill several of these to the brim with soup, throw them in a backpack, and go on a roller coaster ride\u2014they\u2019re slightly thinner than round delis and the tops, while they do latch on securely, aren\u2019t as super-sealing as the sort that buckle onto heavy glass bottoms. But they\u2019re perfect for staying put in small spaces\u2014which is all I\u2019m doing these days anyway. And maybe they won\u2019t look as cute as Mason or Weck jars in your pantry, but they\u2019re infinitely more practical. It may not be hip to be square, but it sure is smart.We're squaring off:Photo by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Pearl Jones16-oz.
