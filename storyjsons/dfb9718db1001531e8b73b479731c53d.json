When the snobby critic Anton Ego eats Remy the rat\u2019s deconstructed, fancy ratatouille and the flavors flash him back to his childhood and his mother serving him ratatouille after he\u2019s fallen off his bike.For me, the answer is so obvious it requires zero consideration: kadhi.Kadhi is the food equivalent to that colorful, well-fitting wool sweater in your perpetual winter rotation. It\u2019s a creamy, cozy, tangy soup thickened with chickpea flour and yogurt, stained with turmeric, and seasoned with a lot of pungent spices (fenugreek, cloves, cumin seeds, mustard seeds, bay leaves, peppercorns) meant for blanketing over rice, a pairing also known as \u201ckadhi chawal.\u201d The base of this dish\u2014chickpea flour, yogurt, and turmeric\u2014is a trio of ingredients found readily in Indian cooking. Turmeric gives food its bright color and earthy depths; yogurt is the cooling accompaniment to spice-heavy meals; and chickpea flour is used as a thickener or a base for spicy fritters and in milky sweets.The recipe for kadhi varies from region to region in India. In Gujarat, kadhi can be lightly sweetened with a little jaggery, and the Sindhi version has vegetables, usually okra. I have tried many versions of kadhi, made by various aunties and uncles. Some aren\u2019t sour enough. Or they\u2019re too thin. Or the flavor of the spices isn\u2019t pronounced enough. My mom\u2019s is, in my opinion, as close to perfect as it gets.Watch Priya make kadhi\nKadhi is the dish my mom pulls out for birthdays, when I come home for the holidays, or when everyone in the house is feeling cold and stuffy. I have distinct memories of sitting on the kitchen counter doing my high school math homework, watching the cauldron-like pot of the bright yellow soup bubble away, the smell of smoky, earthy spices filling the room. My mom, clutching her requisite goblet of red wine, would stand next to the stove, intuitively turning the heat up and down to get it to that ideal thicker-than-soup-but-not-quite-sauce texture.She makes it with my dad\u2019s tart homemade yogurt and a bunch of whole spices that pop and crunch between your teeth. It has a thick, heavy cream-like texture, thanks to the abundance of yogurt. Think of your favorite Cream of ____ soup. Kadhi is that, but better. It\u2019s also delightfully easy (just a few minutes of stirring!), requires no fresh produce to make, and comes together in one pot. You start by saut\u00e9ing the spices until they get toasted and fragrant, then you add the chickpea flour, yogurt, turmeric, and water, and let it cook until it thickens. The last step is making a chhonk\u2014tempered spices\u2014with ghee, cumin seeds, dried red chiles, and red chile powder, and drizzling it over the top. That\u2019s all.There\u2019s one thing I will say about my mom\u2019s version: She likes to add pakoras, fritters made of chickpea flour, to her kadhi while it\u2019s cooking, which is traditional in Uttar Pradesh, where she\u2019s from. My controversial opinion is that I DON\u2019T LIKE PAKORAS IN MY KADHI. I\u2019m sorry, Mom, but I don\u2019t want stuff floating around in my soup! I don\u2019t top my kadhi with anything but chhonk. But you do you.The key to kadhi is that you have to babysit it. Kadhi, like risotto, is a dish that needs to be coddled. You have to stir it to prevent it from curdling, and then you have to keep watching it to make sure it doesn\u2019t boil over (but it\u2019s worth it, I promise!). The other trick is to use the oldest yogurt you can find, because it brings that characteristic tangy flavor. That month-old container in the back of your fridge that you forgot about until just now? That works. Not that kind of yogurt hoarder? A few drops of lime juice will do the trick, too.Here is the final cardinal rule: The only pairing for kadhi is white rice, preferably basmati. My mom once went through this low-carb phase where she exclusively made quinoa or farro. But let me assure you, it ain\u2019t kadhi chawal without those fluffy, gorgeously textured grains of white rice.How much do I love kadhi? Let me count the ways. I love how kadhi coats rice like a satin pillowcase. I love the intense bite of the whole cloves and peppercorns, which get soft but maintain a slight crunch. I love the puddles of chhonk that enrich and enliven everything around them. I love the smooth, sour flavor that makes it like no other soup I\u2019ve ever had.Get the recipe:KadhiThis deeply comforting, spice-forward Indian soup is deceptively simple, easy to pull off, and perfect over a bowl of white rice.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titIndianishWinterSoupRecipes you want to make.
