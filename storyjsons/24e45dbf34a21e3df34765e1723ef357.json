The apple slices get glazed in honey before baking, while the pecan meal is deeply toasted. In the background, tangy buttermilk keeps everything from getting too sweet.IngredientsMakes about 1 dozenNonstick vegetable oil spray2medium Pink Lady or Jonagold apples\u2154cup (75 g) pecans2Tbsp. unsalted butter2Tbsp. honeyFlaky sea salt\u00becup (100 g) all-purpose flour\u00bdcup (60 g) spelt flour or all-purpose flour1\u00bdtsp. baking powder\u00bctsp. baking soda\u00bdtsp. kosher salt2large eggs, room temperature\u00becup (150 g) granulated sugar\u00becup plus 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil\u00bdcup buttermilkRaw sugar or granulated sugar (for sprinkling)PreparationStep 1Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0. Lightly coat flat top of a standard 12-cup muffin pan with nonstick spray (this will prevent muffins from gluing themselves to the pan). Line cups with double layers of muffin liners. Cut apples into quarters; remove cores. Cut each quarter into 4 wedges; set aside.Step 2Pulse pecans in a food processor until you have a fine meal with a bit of texture, like coarse sand. Heat a large skillet over medium-high, then add pecans and toast, stirring, until darkened and very fragrant (it\u2019s okay if they\u2019re even a tiny bit burnt in spots), about 3 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and let cool slightly.Step 3Wipe out skillet and return to medium-high heat. Melt butter, swirling pan so that it\u2019s evenly coated, until foaming, then add reserved apples. Drizzle with honey and generously sprinkle with sea salt. Cook, tossing often, until apples are tender and deep golden brown and glazed with honey, about 5 minutes. Scrape into a medium bowl and let cool.Step 4Add all-purpose flour, spelt flour, baking powder, baking soda, and kosher salt to nuts; whisk to combine. Beat eggs and granulated sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on high speed until mixture is thick, pale, and tripled in volume, 8\u201310 minutes.Step 5Combine oil and buttermilk in a measuring glass. With motor running, gradually pour into egg mixture, stopping as soon as incorporated to prevent eggs from deflating. Scrape into bowl with dry ingredients and fold until just combined (be careful not to overmix). Scoop about 2 Tbsp. batter into each muffin cup and place an apple slice on top. Divide remaining batter among muffin cups, filling until just below the top (you may have a spoonful or two of batter left over). Place 1 apple slice on top of each, then spoon any glaze left in the bowl on top. (You\u2019ll have a few leftover apple slices; eat them.) Sprinkle each muffin with some raw sugar and a pinch of sea salt.Step 6Bake muffins until golden brown all over, rotating pan halfway through, 22\u201328 minutes. Let cool in pan 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.Step 7Do Ahead: Batter can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill.How would you rate Apple-Honey-Pecan Muffins?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (13)Back to TopTriangleI followed the directions exactly along with adjusting to our high altitude.  Seems that mixing eggs and sugar so long isn\u2019t necessary.  Muffin cups should only be filled about half full.  Larger muffin tins are best.  I used regular 12 muffin size and had enough left over batter for 4 large muffins.  The muffins in the larger size were better.  Recipe is way too oily.  A complicated recipe that sounded good but isn\u2019t, sorry to say. Had to throw out the 12 in the regular sized tins.  They ran over the sides and into the over.  Even though I used muffin liners, they were impossible to remove.  The muffin liners were soaked in olive oil.  Not my kind of muffin.New Mexico5/24/2020Yum - I had to eat one right out of the oven! They taste delicious - would like to know if the outsides are meant to be crunchy/if there is meant to be a hard top. Mine aren't - still delicious but not sure if something went wrong. Also - maybe my cups were smaller than the recipe called for but the batter stretched to about 18-20! AnonymousLondon, UK4/26/2020These were delicious. The texture and the taste was amazing thanks to the ground toasted pecans. The only problem I had was that they didn't hold together very well. I'll try whipping the eggs a little bit less next time. I made them with maple syrup instead of honey and it was delightful. I also cut the apples into smaller pieces Will definitely make them again. Might try adding more apple slices into each muffin. AnonymousQuebec4/4/2020Super tasty and moist (even after skipping all of the egg whipping)! My muffin tops got lightly crispy in a very good way. butterslavePortland, OR1/13/2020I have literally just pulled these muffins out of the oven and had to try them immediately and WOW! They're some of, if not the best muffins I've ever made. The recipe is perfect - I thought there was the right amount of apple in there and I dusted the tops with a little bit of brown sugar. I also didn't have the spelt flour, so I just used all-purpose and they're fine. Some are unsure about the olive oil, but it gives them a nice flavour! Best devoured warm.Gold Coast, Australia12/2/2019Made this yesterday, it certainly is a lot of pans and bowls to clean but that was fine as I was looking for a project. Not sure why it says 2 apples if you are cutting each apple into 16 pieces and putting one in each of the dozen muffins the recipe says it makes. That being said I had quite a bit of batter left over after putting 2 tbls batter in each muffin cup. I only used one large apple and had four pieces left over which I added along with the leftover batter to a 6\" springform pan which made a lovely little cake for the freezer. I stuck to the recipe, spelt flour included and only subbed a yogurt/milk mix for the buttermilk as well as adding some vanilla. I loved the trick of toasting the pecan meal and will definitely be doing that in other recipes that call for nut meal. The soft crumb is nice and mine had a pretty lacey top. I think you could easily sub the apples for pears or french plums and the pecans for walnuts which I might do next time. All in all a fun recipe if you're looking for a project and find washing dishes meditative. shallotsandbutterLos Angeles10/15/2019Olive oil: I used a light oil. I\u2019m glad I did. I can see where one poster said it tasted too much like olive if they used a virgin oil. It was a *little too oily .. I will cut out the extra 2 Tb\nI used whole wheat instead of spelt flour I didn\u2019t have.\nFamily thought the ingredients would be weird and were not optimistic they would like these but they did. They were improved with the addition of leftover salted Carmel frosting I had from cinnamon rolls \ud83d\ude01. AnonymousLancaster, PA10/9/2019This recipe is horrible...... Super mushy and All I can taste is olive oil. Which is usually fine, but not in an apple muffin. Unfortunately all of them went into the bin. Completely inedible.AnonymousSalt Lake City10/6/2019Made these tonight and added apple to the batter. I liked that they were not super sweet but I wish I had added cinnamon and vanilla to the batter for more flavor. abeauSouth Carolina9/30/2019A truly amazing muffin recipe. I noticed that some users said that they wished there were more apples on the muffins, so I added an extra apple and I don't regret it. I also had no honey on hand and substituted it with maple syrup. 10/10 would make again.AnonymousOttawa9/26/2019Pros:\nSoft crumb\nTasty flavour of muffin base \nInstagrammable\n\nCons:\nGreasy\nNot enough apple\nToo many dishes for a tiny kitchen\n\nAnonymousToronto9/23/2019These are phenomenal. Beautifully soft crumb, delicious flavor, tiny bits of pecan in every bite, sweet tender apples. Wow. I couldn't find spelt, so I used all all-purpose flour. Going in, the olive oil weirded me out a bit, I wasn't sure going in, but I think it really adds to the flavor, I wouldn't substitute it. My only critique of these is that I loved the apples and wished there were more. Next time I make these I'll probably throw in an extra apple. Wishing I lived in Detroit so I could go to this bakery and try all of their baked goods! abbyrnkn4422AL9/22/2019Haven\u2019t tried this one yet. Just curious about the olive oil. Do you think it necessary or can you sub in a more neutral flavored oil?jobrewstBoston9/19/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titMuffinPastriesAmericanPecanNutAppleFruitButtermilkOther IngredientsFallSnackVegetarianBakingRosh HashanahBreakfastRecipes you want to make.
