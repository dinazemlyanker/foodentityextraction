Haricot verts, however? Fancy. Classy. French. But is there even a real difference between the two?The short answer: Haricot verts are a French variety of green beans, literally translating to \u201cgreen beans\u201d from French\u2014sometimes you\u2019ll even see them sold as \u201cFrench green beans\u201d. They\u2019re long, thin, tender, cook up in a flash, have a bright, robust flavor, and are also typically harvested earlier in the season when the beans are younger. Keep an eye out for them in the summer at your farmers market, when they\u2019re in peak season.To let their light, fresh crispness shine, they\u2019re especially delicious when prepared simply. A quick blanch and a light butter-and-herb dressing is a foolproof method, as is tossing them into a tomato salad, or a summery zucchini and bulgur side dish.The bag of beans you\u2019ve got in the back of your freezer for stir-fries, the canned beans from Kindergarten lunch time, the steam-in-a-bag green beans in the produce aisle\u2014probably not haricot verts. They\u2019re most likely a variety of green beans called Blue Lake beans that are a little fatter, shorter, hardier, and stand up to longer cooking times than haricot verts.Blister them in a cast-iron pan, char them and serve with slabs of paneer, slow-cook them to supple perfection with a bit of harissa. They\u2019ll take a bit longer to cook than their svelte French cousins, but ultimately work in the same preparations. Or give green beans palya a try: This South Asian-style dish made by chopping fresh green beans up into small, quarter inch-sized pieces requires a bit of time to prep, but they cook up fast (like, 3 minutes fast), stay crisp and tender, and allow for maximum surface area to take on sauces and spices. Apply the \u201cpalya\u201d method and throw in fried tofu, dried coconut, and a zippy sambal sauce for a weeknight dinner that\u2019s the perfect combo of sweet, savory, and spicy.So, can you use them in place of each other? You technically can, but remember that haricot verts will have a much shorter cook time, and are a little more delicate. They also may be pricier, and have a shorter season in the summer than the usual Blue Lake variety.To be clear, in addition to the French-style beans and Blue Lake green beans, there are many other veggies out there that are similar. You\u2019ll likely find lots of heirloom varieties at the farmers market, and sometimes familiar types will go by different names depending on how they\u2019re grown (are they pole or bush beans?), and how they\u2019re harvested. Some aren\u2019t even green\u2014you\u2019ll find vibrant purple and yellow varieties out there, too. But, as you\u2019re perusing the aisles of your grocery store, you\u2019re likely picking between these two. And now that you know the difference between haricot verts and good old fashioned green beans, you\u2019re set up for summer success.Coconut Tofu Stir-FryCrispy, bite-sized green beans and coconutty tofu are a match made in heaven in this quick weeknight meal.\u00a0View RecipeRecipes you want to make.
