Introducing Happy Hour with Al, Basically\u2019s new no-nonsense cocktail column.By Al CullitonMarch 7, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie CraigFacebookTwitterEmailTired of cocktail recipes that call for expensive, obscure bottles and fancy-pants techniques? We got you. Welcome to Happy Hour with Al, a monthly column where Al Culliton, Basically's resident bartender, sets you up to get the most bang for your booze with the fewest possible bottles.Have we met? Because I think I know you. You want to figure out how to make nice cocktails at home for you and your friends. You don\u2019t want to spend a ton of money, or buy a ton of weird ingredients just to make one drink, or end up stuck with a bunch of random bottles you\u2019ll never use again. Well, you\u2019re in the right place. Because in this column, I\u2019m going to show you how you can turn three essential bottles of liquor and a handful of bodega staples into three delicious, distinctly different\u2014and easy to make!\u2014cocktails, so you\u2019re set up for a whole weekend of fun, confident home bartending.We\u2019re going to kick things off with some Campari cocktails. Ah, Campari: brilliant red, bitter ambrosia. You\u2019ve seen it before. You\u2019ve probably even had it. Maybe in a Negroni? Or a spritz? It looks really great in just about any setting, and tastes even better. We\u2019re going to learn how to make three pre-war classics with it: the aforementioned Negroni, the Americano, and the Milano-Torino.But let\u2019s back up for a second. What is Campari, anyway? Well, it\u2019s one of Italy\u2019s most iconic aperitivos\u2014a word that refers to both a range of bitter liqueurs and aromatized wines as well as the pre-dinner hours in which they are habitually consumed\u2014and was formulated in 1860 by a fellow from Novara named Gaspare Campari. (Save that fun fact for your next dinner party.) The 19th century was a hot time for aperitivos like Campari, many of which were originally created by monasteries and then by pharmacies\u2014you know, for health purposes. It\u2019s incredibly bitter, like old time-y medicine should be, but that astringency gives way to a really appealing citrusy sweetness. Okay, let\u2019s get to it!Hit the liquor store, hit the bodega, and you\u2019re good to go.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigYour Shopping List:1 750-ml bottle Campari1 750-ml bottle gin (nothing fancy; Gordon\u2019s or Beefeater will work great)1 750-ml bottle sweet vermouth (don\u2019t skimp on vermouth; spring for something like Carpano Antica or Cocchi di Torino if you can)Club soda or seltzer2 oranges3 lemonsIcePhoto by Chelsie CraigThe NegroniUp first: the king of Campari cocktails. The Negroni has gained a lot of traction in recent years, and it is completely deserved. With a handsome equal-parts structure, this triad of gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth is nearly impossible to screw up. (But if you do, it\u2019ll probably be delicious anyway.) It\u2019s supremely balanced between the boozy, the bitter, and the sweet, with a beautifully silky texture that\u2019s as appealing in hot weather as it is in cold.If you want to do it up proper, get a mixing glass out. (If you\u2019ve got a pint glass, that will do!) Pour in 1 oz. each Campari, sweet vermouth, and gin. Fill your mixing glass with ice and stir for a good 15 seconds. Presentation-wise, you\u2019ve got two options. You can strain your Negroni into a rocks glass filled with fresh ice for a longer-drinking, slightly more refreshing drink\u2014it\u2019s ideal for porch sipping. In winter, though, it can be nice to get fancy and strain it into a coupe or other stemmed glass, sans ice, or \u201cup.\u201dAlmost done! It wouldn\u2019t be a Negroni without an orange peel garnish\u2014that peel is full of aromatic oils that will seriously enhance your cocktail drinking experience. Use a vegetable peeler to cut a wide piece of orange peel, avoiding the pith, or white stuff, as much as you can. Squeeze the oils out of the peel and onto the drink by pinching it between your thumbs, fore- and middle-fingers, peel side out, over the glass. (Both hands!) You should be able to see the oil droplets hitting the surface of your drink. Then drag the peel around the rim of the glass, twist it into a nice shape, toss it in the glass and serve. Yeah, you just did that! The thing that bartenders do! It\u2019s not actually hard, and makes your drink look and taste like a million bucks. Cool, huh?(Oh, and if you don\u2019t want to do the whole stirring-and-straining thing, that\u2019s okay. You can \u201cbuild\u201d the drink in a rocks glass, i.e. pour all of the ingredients over ice, give it a stir, and call it a day. The nice thing about stirring in a mixing glass is that you get consistent dilution\u2014extra important when you\u2019re serving it up\u2014and it\u2019s super-cold and silky from the first sip. Worth it, but not essential.)Nerd Corner: The drink is supposedly named after one Count Camillo Negroni, who ordered an \u201cAmericano, with a bit of a kick\u201d from a barman at Florence\u2019s Caff\u00e8 Casoni in 1919. I hate to imagine where we\u2019d be if he hadn\u2019t. Speaking of an Americano...Photo by Chelsie CraigThe AmericanoIt\u2019s on to drink number two! The Americano is fizzy and low enough in alcohol that you can throw back two or three in a sitting without falling off your chair. It\u2019s ideal for when you want to feel like you\u2019re lounging out on some cobblestoned piazza, laughing with friends, even though you\u2019re actually drinking in the kitchen by yourself.Take a tall glass, like a highball or Collins, and fill it with ice. Pour in \u00be oz. Campari and 1 oz. sweet vermouth. Top with club soda or seltzer. Garnish with a lemon peel using the technique we just learned; maybe throw in a nice-looking (i.e. non-plastic) straw.A little more history: It\u2019s called \u201cThe Americano\u201c because it was a favorite of boozing American expats and tourists during Prohibition. (Also, for all you 007 fans out there, it\u2019s the first drink ordered by the man himself in Casino Royale, Ian Fleming\u2019s very first Bond book.)Photo by Chelsie CraigThe Milano-TorinoThis last drink is super easy, and has the unassuming coolness of a well-dressed grandpa. The Milano-Torino is kind of like an Italian Rusty Nail\u2014a cocktail made with Scotch whiskey and a sweet, herbaceous Scottish liqueur called Drambuie\u2014but is brighter and lower octane. And you build it straight in the glass you\u2019re drinking it out of like any good old man drink. Measure out \u00be oz. Campari and pour it into a small rocks glass full of ice. Then do the same with 2\u00bd oz. of sweet vermouth. Stir well and garnish with both a lemon peel and an orange peel.What\u2019s that? That seems like a LOT of vermouth? It\u2019s not. Vermouth is terribly misunderstood. It\u2019s actually delicious, and the reason people think they don\u2019t like it is because most have been using the same old, dusty bottle of cheap vermouth they\u2019ve had for years. It\u2019s made from wine, and it\u2019s perishable! Which means you should always store it in the fridge, and ideally use it within a month. How the hell are you supposed to go through that much vermouth in a month, you ask? Make more Milano-Torinos, obviously!And there you have it, folks: three Campari cocktails you can make with a mere three bottles of liquor. Go forth and make Negronis! Be Italian grandpas!
