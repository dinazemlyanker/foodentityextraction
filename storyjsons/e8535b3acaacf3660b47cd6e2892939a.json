We love fall for a lot of reasons: chunky sweaters, gorgeous foliage, and autumnal-flavored lattes. But that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t make one last-ditch effort to extend summer, what with its warm city strolls and lazy afternoons on the beach, on blankets in the park, and across balmy rooftops everywhere. While we can\u2019t do anything about the impending change of the season, we can cue up your taste buds with a few C\u00ceROC VS French Brandy cocktails to embrace the end of summer. They may not turn back time, but they can make every moment worth savoring last a little longer.FRENCH SHADEPerfect For: A Picnic in the ParkSwing by the farmer\u2019s market and then set up shop in the park with a mini shaker and some ice.
