It's a 2018 Hot 10 winner for a reason.ORDER THE: things that make your mouth water as you browse the menu\u2014the somehow simultaneously melty and charred lamb shoulder, lemony cabbage salad with flecks of mint, seared halloumi with peanut dukkah, all the spreads (we love m\u2019tababal, a swiss chard and tahini dip, in particular). The signature perfectly puffy flatbreads come with your meal\u2014you'll eat a lot of them.THE VIBE IS: lit (sorry). Obviously, the custom-built hearth is the centerpiece of owner Rose Previte\u2019s restaurant, but you\u2019ll want to hang out a bit further afield, either upstairs in the more intimate space or at one of the ornately adorned tables, to still get in on the action. Bonus: The Obamas have been spotted here...PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day: Monday to Friday, 5 p.m. to 2 a.m., and Saturday and Sunday, 5 p.m. to 3 a.m.Michael Graydon and Nikole HerriottWE ALSO LOVEThe LineThe kind of place you might hang out at, even if you aren\u2019t staying thereBad SaintBold Filipino cooking that tastes best with beer and loud musicLittle SerowThe wait is worth it for Johnny Monis\u2019s sweet, sweet heatExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
