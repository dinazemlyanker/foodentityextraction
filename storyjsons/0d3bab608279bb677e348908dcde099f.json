It\u2019s \u201ca first-class legal thriller\u2026 that\u2019s fast-paced and full of surprises,\u201d according to someone who knows a thing or two about page-turners, best-selling author Scott Turow. But it wasn\u2019t written by a repeat best-seller. It was penned by none other than Stacey Abrams, founder of voting rights group Fair Fight. Given how much she has on her plate, taking on voter suppression by day and writing books by night, cooking for others is an enjoyable diversion.If you could have any three guests at your ideal dinner party, who would they be?Octavia Butler, an amazing science fiction writer. Lyndon B. Johnson, one of the most fascinating politicians, who went from being a rabid segregationist to being the midwife for civil rights. And Star Trek\u2019s Kathryn Janeway, captain of the USS Voyager. She has to marshal her crew, work with her enemies, and keep morale up while taking on a seemingly endless journey to salvation.You seem to love sci-fi based on the guest list, but your own books include romance novels (written under a pseudonym), and you\u2019re just out with your first legal thriller. Is there anything you can\u2019t do?My mom once said that I would be a jack-of-all-trades and the master of none. So I thought that meant I needed to be a master of all trades. I completely missed the point of her admonition.Where would this dinner be?I\u2019d do it at my home because I really love cooking and because the conversation could get rowdy. When you\u2019re in a private room at a restaurant, people are in and out. I want to suggest \u201chere we are in this safe space, no holds barred. Let\u2019s talk.\u201dDo you break out one of those conversation-starter games?No. LBJ was well known to be a raconteur. Janeway is not shy; she\u2019s going to take her space. And then, from Octavia Butler\u2019s writing, I can only imagine that she would ask really provocative questions that would lead to vigorous and boisterous argument.And what\u2019s the tabletop aesthetic like?I have this really nice set of plates I think I got from Crate and Barrel. They\u2019re really pretty with an ombr\u00e9 pattern. When I have guests over, that\u2019s what I use. I\u2019d do a runner as well. It makes a table feel sophisticated without it being too complicated. And then nice placemats that fit with the runner, but it\u2019s not stuffy.Photo courtesy Crate & BarrelLainie 90-Inch Yellow Table Runner$50 at Crate and BarrelWhat do you cook?I would make crusted-chicken Romano, a pan-fried paillard of chicken crusted with Romano cheese and panko. Asparagus risotto and a side of haricots verts. For dessert, I would make a New York\u2013style cheesecake.Is there a secret ingredient in your cheesecake?I learned to make cheesecake by reading the back of the Philadelphia Cream Cheese box. Over time I\u2019ve perfected my recipe by watching Julia Child. And the Pioneer Woman does really interesting things with her cheesecake. So mine is a blend of the three.Where do you go to relax the day after your dinner?When I\u2019m truly in a celebratory mood, I go to Sotto Sotto, an Italian restaurant in the Inman Park neighborhood of Atlanta. They do this strozzapreti with rag\u00f9 that is the most delicious thing I eat.Explore Bon App\u00e9titDream Dinner PartyInterviewsRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
