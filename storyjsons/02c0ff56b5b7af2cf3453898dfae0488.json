The citrus notes of cardamom and coriander lend brightness to the broth, and a one-two punch of salt and acid by way of crunchy pita chips and pickled red onion finish the dish off.Ingredients4 servings1small red onion, thinly sliced2Tbsp. fresh lemon juiceKosher salt2Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil2Tbsp. unsalted butter1large yellow onion, thinly sliced4garlic cloves, thinly sliced8green cardamom pods, lightly crushed1tsp. ground coriander\u00bctsp. crushed red pepper flakes1large bunch mature spinach, trimmed, or one 10-oz. package frozen whole-leaf spinach, thawed1lb. skinless, boneless chicken thighsSteamed white rice and pita chips (for serving)PreparationStep 1Combine red onion, lemon juice, a large pinch of salt, and 2 Tbsp. water in a small bowl.

A few modifications I made folks might want to try. I used chard out of the garden rather than spinach. I'm a bit mystified at adding spinach (or chard) so early in the braise. One, it's hard to fish the chicken out from around the greens and two, they are really overcooked. I added them 5 min before the chicken was done, but I will probably add them with the shredded meat and cook for 5-7 min next time. As recommended by another reviewer, I added 3/4c of brown lentils when the chicken went in and did without the rice. I also used chicken stock rather than water. As as recommended by others, I doubled the spices and added 1 1/2 tsp of (New York Shuk) harissa when the shredded chicken went back in. It brightened it up.Eric W.Durham, NC1/30/2022Lovely bright soup for a chilly spring day. I subbed mushroom broth for water and added a half cup of brown lentils - fab! AnonymousMontreal5/3/2021This was one of the best things I've ever made. I doubled the recipe and used a whole chicken instead of breasts. I divided the chicken into parts, browned the skin and used the rendered schmaltz to cook the onions and spices. When the chicken was done I pulled it out and let it cool before pulling apart. Then I strained out the spinach into a bowl, and used an immersion blender to emulsify the schmaltz on the surface into the soup. Added everything back in and served with the pickled onions!! sbangsPortland, OR7/1/2020Great stuff as usual Morocco!  I just added allspice and a little bit of cumin extra. \n\nBut so yum. Thanks! TheCrookCookEGYPT12/1/2019I doubled the spices because I thought it was bland otherwise. The garnishes save it.AnonymousAtlanta 2/18/2019A super delicious, easy, and quick go-to weekday meal that satisfies the flavor palate. I found that 3 cups of water rather than 2 cups worked best. AnonymousChicago1/21/2019This is delicious! Soul-satisfying, and also totally wholesome. Don't skip the pita chips on top.AnonymousNew York 11/26/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titSoupSoups and StewsSpinachLeafy GreensVegetableChicken ThighChickenPoultryCardamomHerbs & SpicesEasyOne-Pot MealsWeeknight MealsMainNut-FreeHealthyishSimmerDinnerRecipes you want to make.
