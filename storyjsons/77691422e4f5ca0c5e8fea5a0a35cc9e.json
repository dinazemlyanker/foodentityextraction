And here's a thing I won\u2019t do in the summer: cook anything that requires me to be directly next to my stove for more than five minutes. Which is why I was very excited that Andy Baraghani\u2019s new spaghetti with no-cook puttanesca recipe met all of my VERY strict summer cooking requirements.His Stovetop Lite recipe takes all the things I love about a classic puttanesca (salty! briny! olive-y!), and makes it above-90-degree-friendly by eliminating the need to, you know, cook the sauce or be in the vicinity of a burner. Plus, it\u2019s super simple to throw together. Like, so simple that you could text a friend the recipe. Actually, let's just do it like that. Here\u2019s how my text would read:\"Hi [insert friend\u2019s name]! So glad you asked me for a pasta recipe that's appropriate to make after spending 20 minutes sweating on the subway platform. First, pulse 2 beefsteak tomatoes (remove the seeds by cutting them in half and giving them a squeeze!), 2 cloves of grated garlic, 1 tsp. of red pepper flakes, and a big pinch of salt in a food processor until smooth. Yes, you can use a blender in a pinch. Then transfer all that sauce to a large bowl and mix in lots of halved cherry tomatoes, 1 cup of crushed and pitted Castelvetrano olives (the only olives that matter), 2 tablespoons of capers, and about a \u00bc cup oil.Cherry tomatoes give this sauce an even brighter flavor.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Olivia Mack McCoolMeanwhile, throw your spaghetti in a large pot of boiling salted water\u2014for minimal heat impact stand very far away while it cooks. I work at Bon App\u00e9tit, so of course you're going to save \u00bc cup pasta water. That's the law. Then add your al dente pasta, \u00bc cup of chopped parsley, and three tablespoons of unsalted butter to your bowl o\u2019 sauce. This part is important: toss everything very vigorously with tongs, while adding a splash of that pasta cooking liquid as needed to create an emulsified sauce that coats pasta. Like really toss\u2014you want the tomato sauce to really cling! Divide serve your pasta in bowls and drizzle with MORE oil. Find a chair and throw it directly in front of your A.C. unit. Marvel at the fact that you are not sweating.\"That\u2019s it! That's my text. And that\u2019s the recipe. The dish is a super bright and savory pasta that you can make without the slightest chance of breaking a sweat\u2014a rare feat on a way-too-hot summer day. And even rarer when you also happen to be making pasta.Get the full recipe:Spaghetti with No-Cook PuttanescaA bright, summertime pasta sauce packed with in-season tomatoes and briny olives.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titNever FailBasicallyPastaTomatoRecipes you want to make.
