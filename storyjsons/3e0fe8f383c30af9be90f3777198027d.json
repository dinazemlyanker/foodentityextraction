While big-name brands dominate the grocery store, it\u2019s the small-batch breweries across the country that capture our hearts\u2014and soothe our stomachs after going too hard on that taco crawl. But it\u2019s not just about the probiotics: Just like craft beer, kombucha is a great representation of regional tastes and quirks. The best bottles expertly balance acid and funk, pulling in heritage fruits (like Georgia peaches) and ceremonial-grade teas for a vibrant drinking experience unlike anything we can find at our usual bodegas. And yes, the whole gut health thing comes in handy after a long day of travel too. These are some of the many regional kombuchas we dream of sneaking past TSA.Photo by Chelsie CraigYesfolk Tonics: Troy, NYWhy we like it: This family-run microbrewery is helmed by trained herbalists, who use single-origin teas and ceremonial plants like palo santo and yaupon. One sip of their aromatic, wild tonics will forever make mass-produced kombucha taste like one-note apple cider vinegar.Favorite flavors: Yaupon, burdock-and-cardamom-laced Crystal Falls, or whatever you can get your hands on.Hex Ferments: Baltimore, MDWhy we like it: This Maryland-based fermentory is committed to doing things differently...like using wind power to turn local produce into kimchi, krauts, and kombucha with technicolor hues and tripped-out names.Favorite flavor: Butterfly Lime, which gets its shocking lavender hue from sweet pea flowers.KTonic: Austin, TXWhy we like it: This is the aggressively bubbly kombucha we crave on a hot afternoon. Instead of adding fruit juice, KTonic uses a single-fermentation approach that embraces herbaceous, almost-savory flavors.Favorite flavors: Original, a punchy mix of ginger and lemongrass anchored by deep tea flavor, and delicate Cherry Blossom.Baba\u2019s Brew: Phoenixville, PAWhy we like it: Made from a Siberian family recipe, these nuanced kombuchas are made with whole fruits, not sugary juices or concentrates. And yeah, that squirrel on the label is pretty damn cute.Favorite flavors: Purple Rain, with blueberries and ginger root, and Believe, a mossy green tonic supercharged with lemon balm, juniper berries, and chlorella.Blue Ridge Bucha: Charlottesville, VAWhy we like it: A full-bodied base blend of green and black teas acts as a foundation for juicy fruit flavor without veering into soda territory. This might be the smoothest kombucha we\u2019ve ever had.Favorite flavors: Bluegrass Bucha and Elderflower Sunrise.Revive Kombucha,: Sonoma, CAWhy we like it: Revive serves up clean, straightforward flavors with just the right amount of fire and funk. They\u2019re all about balance and nuance, giving traditional kombucha flavors a boost of the unexpected.Favorite flavor: Yerba Mate Ginger is laced with vanilla and almond extract for cream soda vibes, and Turmeric Ginger Citrus brings the heat with a boost from black peppercorns.Photo by Chelsie CraigHoney Jun: Leavenworth, WAWhy we like it: Jun Kombucha is traditionally made with green tea and honey (instead of black tea and sugar), and cold brewed to reduce bitterness. The result? Light-bodied, aromatic probiotic drinks that go down easy\u2014and are spiked with adaptogenic herbs for an added good-for-you boost.Favorite flavors: Pear Lime Nettle and Jasmine Rose.Kickin\u2019 Kombucha: Houston, TXWhy we like it: If pressed juices and kombucha had a baby, they\u2019d taste like this. These colorful bottles aren\u2019t just filled with your standard SCOBY strings, but botanicals and juice pulp too. Shake at your own peril!Favorite flavors: Blueberry Mojito and The Goodness, a bracing blend of lemon, matcha, wheatgrass, spirulina, and kelp.MOR Kombucha: Denver, COWhy we like it: Familiar cans and less-familiar flavors join forces to create slightly sweet, intentionally accessible kombucha that drinks like a happy hour cocktail.Favorite flavors: Mojito, Ginger Grapefruit, and Cactus Fruit.Big Easy Bucha New Orleans, LAWhy we like it: This stuff is one hell of a NOLA hangover cure. The large format, low-sugar kombucha is ultra dry and tart, with fruit-forward flavors that celebrate the city\u2019s culture and palate.Favorite flavors: Bayou Berry, with strawberry and honeysuckle, and Street Car Sipper, which uses the tiny, tart satsuma oranges that grow across Louisiana in winter.Explore Bon App\u00e9titKombuchaRead MoreLifestyleYesfolk Tonics Makes Kombucha Like You've Never Seen\u2014Or Tasted\u2014BeforeBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
