Chicago-born Rosio S\u00e1nchez ruled the Noma pastry department for years before opening her popular taco stands, Hija de Sanchez. With her first sit-down restaurant, she marries serious Mexican sourcing and tradition with modern technique and a hit of Scandinavian tartness. Turns out gooseberries are great in avocado dip!ORDER THE: tasting menu if you\u2019re feeling flush. Otherwise, grab whatever tacos are of the moment, along with octopus al pastor. And as you can imagine, the cocktails are musts, from the Bloody Mary to the Sanchez Margarita made with mezcal, pasilla chile syrup, and lime. We\u2019re hoping S\u00e1nchez opens an ice cream stand just to serve her churro parfait sandwich.THE VIBE IS: beachy and casual, bordering on a party. (See cocktails, above.)PRACTICAL STUFF: Open for dinner Thursday to Monday, from 5 p.m. to midnight (though the kitchen closes at 10 p.m.); brunch Saturday and Sunday, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. (kitchen closes at 1:30 p.m.). Closed Tuesday and Wednesday. For those used to taco-stand prices, these small plates can quickly add up to a bigger night out.\u2014Christine MuhlkePhoto by Ditte IsagerWE ALSO LOVESlurp Ramen JointObsessively, meticulously made ramen that\u2019s got people lining up in Indre ByRestaurant Pal\u00e6gadeHead to Indre By to eat all the open-face sandwiches (and herring)La BanchinaGet real R&R in at this Amager Harbor vegetable-focused restaurant with a few surprisesExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
