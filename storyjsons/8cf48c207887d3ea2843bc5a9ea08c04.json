Each of the nine rooms has a no-frills, boho feel, with big windows covered by white, flowy curtains and pops of color throughout (a gold dresser, blue headboard). There\u2019s likely a Crosley record player in your room and Malin+Goetz soaps in the bathroom, making you feel more at home than in a hotel. But the best thing in the hotel is Bar Covell, the thimble-sized wine bar downstairs run by sommelier Matthew Kaner.PRACTICAL STUFF: Rooms start at $295. Since the hotel has a very limited amount of rooms, it\u2019s best to book out as far ahead as you can.\u2014Elyse InamineCourtesy of Mayne Marketing AgencyWE ALSO LOVEAce Hotel DTLAA hipster wonderland with a juice bar in the lobby and acoustic guitars in the roomsKismetMediterranean family-style feasting from morning to nightTiki-TiEverything you love about dive bars\u2014plus paper umbrellas\u2014in Los FelizExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
