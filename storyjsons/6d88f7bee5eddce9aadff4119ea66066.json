Our test kitchen manager has his own Fermentation Station\u2122, not to mention a hit Youtube series and a dizzying amount of overall food knowledge. So when he started waxing poetic about Activist m\u0101nuka honey, whose brightly patterned jars we\u2019ve been spotting on the shelves of our favorite wellness shops for months, we sat up and listened.But first we had to figure out: What exactly is m\u0101nuka honey? And why does it cost five times the price of the bear-shaped stuff? (See: This 2015 episode of Broad City, where Abbi goes to the Gowanus Whole Foods while under anesthesia and spends over $1,000 on a shopping spree that prominently features m\u0101nuka honey.)M\u0101nuka honey comes from New Zealand, where bees pollinate the native M\u0101nuka bush. The plant has been a cornerstone of Maori medicine for centuries, and honey made from its nectar is thought to have a wide range of benefits like immune and digestive support along with skin-healing properties. It has a grittier texture than other types of honey, a deep golden hue, and a strongly floral, sometimes bitter taste. While research is still limited, m\u0101nuka honey\u2019s healing properties are thought to come from its high levels of an antibacterial compound called methylglyoxal.  \u201cAll honey has methylglyoxal, but m\u0101nuka honey has extremely high levels of it, which is what makes it such a beautiful product,\u201d says Luke Harwood, who co-owns Activist with his wife, Gabrielle Mirkin. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing for immune support, digestive support, topical breakouts, and more.\"Today m\u0101nuka honey can be found everywhere from luxe skincare brands to the shelves of Trader Joe's. This highly saturated market, paired with an incomplete regulatory system, has resulted in a lot of bad honey on the market. Activist aims to fix that. Harwood and Mirkin, both native New Zealanders, pride themselves on their small, sustainable business that prioritizes potency and transparency.Feeling burned out from high-stress careers in fashion and magazine editorial, the couple saw an opportunity to focus on m\u0101nuka after some friends set up hives on their property in New Zealand. \"We wanted to create a product that is direct from Mother Nature,\" says Harwood. \"I saw an opportunity for m\u0101nuka to be elevated and educated about on a global scale.\"M\u0101nuka honey is easy to find these days, but the potency can vary wildly. Most products verify their effectiveness through one of two scales: UMF (Unique Manuka Factor) and MGO, which measures milligrams of methylglyoxal per kilograms. Activist currently offers three levels of honey: 850+ MGO, 300+ MGO, and 100+ MGO. \u201cThe  850+ MGO is my medicine, I even give it to my two-year-old,\u201d Leone says. \u201cThe lower grade, more everyday ones make me feel like Winnie the Pooh\u2014they\u2019re golden, more mellow in flavor, and just one of the best honeys I\u2019ve ever had.\u201dOf course the difference between an \"everyday\" m\u0101nuka honey and \"medicine\" comes down to price. And yes, that high price tag is perhaps m\u0101nuka honey's best-known trait. Activist's top-shef, 850+ MGO honey is $75 a jar, and other brands go even higher. The cost is a reflection of rarity, since this honey can only be made when the m\u0101nuka bush flowers for a few short weeks between spring and early summer. The window is brief\u2014anywhere from two to six weeks depending on the year\u2014and attempting to prolong the harvest period can introduce other nectar and subsequently diminish potency.But luckily you don't need to eat much to reap m\u0101nuka's benefits (even though you might want to). Harwood says just a teaspoon or two a day is enough. Stir it into smoothies, drizzle it onto granola, or slather it on your skin. Feel free to experiment: In the BA test kitchen, Leone is fond of stirring it into everything from vinaigrettes to sun tea. Just keep in mind that m\u0101nuka honey is raw, so it\u2019s best kept below a temperature of 100\u00b0F. And if you just go ahead and eat it straight from the jar, well, that's pretty sweet too.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishNew ZealandhoneyShoppingTrendsRead MoreLifestyleOn the Hunt For Fermented HoneyBy Ashley MasonRecipes you want to make.
