Thanks to all the comments, I always double everything but the seafood. This especially makes sense when it comes to the cabbage-get a small head and you won\u2019t have unused cabbage in your crisper. And I use white vermouth instead of sake because it\u2019s what I have. Such a delicious, nutritious and easy dish!AnonymousTampa3/14/2022I did not have sake, and I use, Sharo Xin wine ( Chinese cooking wine).. lets see how it turns out.\nAnonymousSingapore10/4/2021Really delicious! I used cod fillets, doubled the broth, and used bonito soup stock instead of kombu. I wish I had doubled the whole recipe!KateLos Angeles, CA4/10/2021Fish didn't cook at all when the heat was on low after boiling. Think the recipe should be clearer and maintain that the water should continue to be boiling for the steaming process to cook the fish!RainNew York, NY12/14/2020Quick, easy, not a ton of ingredients, healthy and delicious! The perfect mid week meal. Will be remaking this a lot.Megan GLos Angeles, CA11/10/2020This took me 20 minutes including prep, which in and of itself is amazing, but the flavors that were produced in such a short amount of time really knocked this one out of the park. Surprisingly to me, the cabbage was the star of the show. I served it with rice and it was perfect. lgehgaAustin, Texas9/24/2020Make this recipe all the time and have experimented a bit. Note: If you make it with the ingredients here, it will not look like the photo! Double the amount of broth for more liquid. We like to add a few dried chiles to the broth for some subtle heat. And we don't have kombu so we add strips of dried nori. Other than that, it really doesn't need any extra flavors...it's very umami and warming. AnonymousCalifornia8/2/2020Great recipe, SO easy! I used barramundi. Didn't have sake so used white wine.AnonymousSingapore6/18/2020My husband and I both loved this! I made the recipe as written to serve 4 except used only enough salmon to serve two because we like the extra vegetables and broth. Used beech mushrooms and rehydrated shiitakes. Although we tend to prefer strong flavors, we  thought that the subtle nuances in this broth were perfect. I couldn't imagine wanting to muddy up this dish by adding other ingredients.vetterlCalifornia5/22/2020One of the best recipes I've tried from BA so far!! Love it so much thanks Christina <3 cloze9Australia5/19/2020Anon from the future is I think mistaken. Kombu is seaweed. I think you're thinking of dashi which is seaweed and bonito flakes. #protectChristina #listentotheasians #iamasianAnonymousa better future5/13/2020Such a simple recipe. It is also very humble and can be modified to suit your taste/what you have. I ad no access to cod but had some frozen pollock which worked nicely. Comes together really quick for a humble and warming meal! Love it Christina :)AnonymousNew Jersey4/15/2020Ok, this is SUCH A GOOD RECIPE. I made this tonight, on a damp, blustery, frigid Canadian spring evening amid the godforsaken Covid-19 crisis and it was the perfect, delicate remedy my fianc\u00e9 and I needed! I doubled the broth batch for an extra soupy turn out and used fresh cod along with Napa cabbage, broccolini and shiitake mushrooms. Took about 15 -17 minutes, as my fish was quite thick, but the end result was heavenly. We served it On white rice topped with scallions, toasted sesame and a bit of chili oil. Such a gentle, heartwarming, filling and incredible dish. 10/10 would recommend. Give me more recipes like this <3 Sbarber3Ontario4/13/2020This recipe needs help.  First kombu is technically seaweed but for anyone other than a dictionary it usually refers to a broth made with bonito flakes and \u201ckombu\u201d seaweed.  I highly recommend using kombu broth (BA has a good recipe).  Second, as described the fish is raw.  You either need more liquid or a higher heat.  Third this recipe as others have noted was quite bland.   If I ever made this again I would cook the cabbage and mushrooms separately in some kombu broth with sake and soy then drain the broth into a pan and cook the fish covered for a few minutes.     Then combine.  Enjoy. AnonymousThe future4/3/2020This is a fantastic and simple recipe. You must use Kombu (easy to find in a Japanese grocery) as that is what makes this taste like you are a pro chef. I used salmon and subbed spinach for the cabbage/mushrooms. Everyone ate it all up including my picky eater who said it was great after one bite.
