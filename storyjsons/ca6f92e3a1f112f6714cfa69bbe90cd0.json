Your postponed wedding. Coworker happy hour. Whatever your IRL event, we\u2019ve got a wine for that.By Alex BeggsMay 5, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailYOU DID IT! You\u2019re double-vaxxed, two weeks out, and ready to rage! Your bloodstream is pumping with little messenger RNA cells whispering to each other, Let\u2019s hang out. And so we shall, with the blessing of a nice nurse named Chris, who came out of retirement just to perform this civic duty.* Thanks, Chris!So in the great tradition of pairing wines for the hell of it, I consulted Sage Redman at the wonderful Grapefruit Wines store in Hudson, NY, to pick wines for whatever post-vax rager you\u2019re planning, from the awkward intimate gatherings to that giant wedding you\u2019ve been holding out on. Cheers!*I got Pfizer.Note: However you\u2019re partying, please follow [CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html) and all that stuff. And if you don\u2019t plan on getting vaccinated, you are not allowed to continue reading. Get outta here!A low-stakes dinner party with two other peopleOh, God, where are the NAPKINS. People eat with NAPKINS, remember? For such a stressful situation\u2014oh, God, WHEN WILL THEY LEAVE?\u2014you need an easygoing wine. Go for Cossard\u2019s \u201cVersion Sud\u201d Grenache, which tastes like \u201cbright bing cherry in a glass,\u201d Sage says. And, like you, it\u2019s best when chilled out.Brunch with GrandmaPerhaps you\u2019ve only seen her through a window in the past year, or worse, not at all! How will you even know if you\u2019ve gained weight/are still unmarried if your grandma isn\u2019t there to tell you? You\u2019ve been worried about her, she\u2019s been worried about you, and both of you need to gather around a platter of pepperoni lasagna with 26-month-old powdered Parmesan, which is begging for a nice bottle of literally anything to wash it all down. Even better, Fattoria Mani Di Luna Sangiovese, a LITER of fresh \u2019n\u2019 easy rustic table red that\u2019ll take you from the early afternoon till at least the 6 o\u2019clock news. The one with the cute weatherman. Hear he\u2019s single!Bring the book club back togetherYou guys had a WHOLE YEAR to read Where the Crawdads Sing and yet only three people did and they don\u2019t even remember who the killer was. Was it even a murder mystery? I DON\u2019T REMEMBER. Other things have happened since then! Refresh your memory of what it\u2019s like to be disappointed in your friends, vaguely intellectually stimulated, and in another person\u2019s home with a double liter of \u201cglou glou cinsault,\u201d per Sage, Domaine Puech Redon\u2019s 2L. The double-liter serves a crowd, yes, but fun fact: It was bottled specifically to get around the stupid wine tariffs that went into effect in 2020 (there was a lot going on last year).Pool party with 17 of your closest budsPhoto and prop styling by Anna Morris, Courtesy Grapefruit WinesNo glass! La Bodega de las Estrellas makes a magnum-size POUCH of Tempranillo ros\u00e9 with a little spout and a handle and everything. Perfect pool-party wine.Your postponed weddingIn a year of isolation, you may have realized that the person you wanted to spend the rest of your life will never learn how to brush their teeth without leaving toothpaste puddles all over the sink. But you put a down payment for this wedding, so let\u2019s get on with it. The white: Miles Garrett Chardonnay. Sage says it\u2019s oaky in a good way, and anyone who hates California Chards is challenged not to like this. \u201cIt feels luxe, subtle, and sleek, which it should, because this is the first time you\u2019ve worn heels in over a year.\u201d The red: Roberto Henr\u00edquez Santa Cruz de Coya. This Chilean wine comes from a Pa\u00eds vine that\u2019s like 200 years old, which is a good omen for the long-lasting depths of your love, right? The bubbles: Les Hautes Terres, M\u00e9thode Ancestrale \u201cl\u2019Air du Paradis\u201d. A spritzy pet-nat that \u201cbursts with delicate apple blossoms as it does rich nuttiness and depth,\u201d Sage says. And \u201cthe Air of Paradise\u201d may or may not refer to your vaccinated friends and family, breathing clean congratulations into your newly married face.An orgyPhoto and prop styling by Anna Morris, Courtesy Grapefruit WinesI\u2019m not here to judge your postvaccination rager of choice, I\u2019m just trying to accurately represent all possible options. And this is definitely one. You need a wine as wild as you are. Azienda Agricola Nasciri\u2019s Calabrese Nero \u201cis a dirty girl,\u201d Sage says. You can see its \u201cchunky sediment\u201d settled at the bottom of the bottle (and feel free to use \u201cchunky sediment\u201d as your safe word). Sage says this wine is \u201cnot modest,\u201d tastes almost like vermouth, and that fans of Dr Pepper will be into it. So get naked and pass the corkscrew.A shared Airbnb cabin in the woods with palsYou miss your friends so much you want to spend an outdoorsy three-day weekend with them, even if by day one you remember that so-and-so always goes to bed too early, the other one hates \u201call the bugs\u201d and refuses to hike, and nobody ever wants to play Charades, Alex, please don\u2019t make us play games. What will bring together this chaotic group is a bottle of Oyster River Winegrowers \u201cMorphos\u201d pet-nat. Like your friend group, it\u2019s made of hybrid grapes. Sage says: \u201cIt\u2019s spring in a glass, a little woodsy, fresh, and delicious to every palate.\u201dA bangin\u2019 baby showerSuch a momentous occasion, one that cannot be missed even if your baby can already eat solid food and erase her internet history by now. Because PRESENTSSS! A baby shower needs two wines. Number one, a wine inspired by the T-shirts that say \u201cMama needs wine.\u201d The wine she\u2014we all\u2014needs is Domaine Balansa \u201cPech de Rozies,\u201d a blush and peachy ros\u00e9 with a touch of a sea shell salinity, which pairs well with stereotypes and chocolate-covered strawberries in equal measure. Wine No. 2: A nonalcoholic wine for any nondrinkers! Domaine des Grottes L\u2019Antidote is \u201ca killer nonalcoholic \u2018wine,\u2019\u201d says Sage, which is made from grapes and 15 different herbs. It tastes like good vermouth, but it\u2019s sparkling, and 0% ABV. YUM!An out-of-practice house party, show your vax card at the doorThis vaccination has you craving a sticky-floored, tub-full-of-High-Life, vase-breaking house party. But because you\u2019re 37, you want the tub full of decent wine and for people to take off their shoes. Fill the tub with Domaine Rietsch \u201cTout Blanc\u201d\u2014liters, again! A great wine size. Sage says it\u2019s \u201cdangerously drinkable,\u201d aromatic, and mineral-driven. Buy too much so you can drink it summerlong.A meet-and-greet with the new coworkers you\u2019ve only seen on ZoomAll along you\u2019ve default assumed your new coworkers are at least 6'5\"\u2014they seem tall in the little box, don\u2019t they? And once everyone\u2019s vaxxed and has taken three days off each to \u201crecover\u201d (lies), it\u2019s time to see how tall they really are. This gathering is sure to be awkward (Nico, it turns out, is an average 5'11\"), so you need a wine that can distract everyone. Give them something to talk about. Laura Lorenzo\u2019s Camino de la Frontera Tinto is that wine.\u201cLaura has been working to bring biodiversity and soil health back to Spain\u2019s \u2018green hill\u2019 of Galicia, an area previously rampant with industrial farming,\u201d Sage says. \u201cThe Camino de la Frontera Tinto is predominantly a grape called Juan Garcia, but what\u2019s most important and delightfully captivating about this wine is its deliciousness. Scrubby mediterranean dried herbs, bright red fruit with an undercurrent of spice and earth, refined and rustic, full of life and intrigue. It just slaps!\u201dFuck it. Take the kids to Chuck E. CheesePhoto and prop styling by Anna Morris, Courtesy Grapefruit WinesEverybody has to rage in their own way. I\u2019m not suggesting you sneak in wine to Chuck E. Cheese, but I am suggesting that, three exhausted hours after, when you get home and sink into the couch and can\u2019t get the smell of congealed cheese out of your pores, you drink a glass of Tissot\u2019s Patchwork Chardonnay. Like you, Sage says, \u201cthis wine gives and gives.\u201d It\u2019s lush, elegant, and deep...like the couch. You\u2019re vaccinated and free now, but the couch, the couch will always be there.Warehouse EDM rave in BushwickWow, sweaty. You might be vaccinated, but remember, you\u2019re not immune to the mysteries that linger on the lips of strangers. For all that dancing (thrashing?), you\u2019re gonna need a refreshing wine that holds up well in a flask. Try tequila.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCoronavirusPicnicPartyShoppingRead MoreculturePipe\u00f1o Is Our Post-Zoom WineBy Joseph HernandezcultureI\u2019m Still Wearing Sweaters, But Current Cassis Is My First Taste of SpringBy Aliza AbarbanelcultureIs It Ever Okay\u2026to Bring a Single Serving to a Picnic?By Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
