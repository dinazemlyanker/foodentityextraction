It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.I\u2019m thinking back on the early weeks of stay-at-home measures, when we all ran out in preparation desperation and bought all the canned things. Canned beans, canned soups, canned tomatoes, and yes\u2014canned tuna (or jarred, if you\u2019re fancy). Even as I laughed at myself, I still gave into the panic and stocked up. Weeks later, and despite my very limited grocery shopping, I\u2019ve barely used the supplies I gathered. But what\u2019s it for, if not for eating? Let\u2019s get into it!Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!There are lots of ways to make tuna salad and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll yell at me for not doing it the way you do it, or the way your grandmother did it, or your step-aunt or second cousin or beloved diner does it, which I\u2019m certain is the best way. Which way was that, again? It must have celery. It better not have celery. It needs more mayo. The big mistake is that people use mayo. If it doesn\u2019t have dill, you\u2019re fired. If it has dill, I won\u2019t eat it. Sorry\u2014I was just transcribing the torrent of comments you haven\u2019t sent me yet. I understand. But I don\u2019t care. Tuna salad is universal, and yet deeply personal. This is how I make mine:Always pair with pickles and chips!\nAlex LauFirst, finely dice a small shallot, throw it in a small bowl, and squeeze enough fresh lemon juice over to cover, then season with salt and give it a stir. (If you don\u2019t have a lemon, use your favorite vinegar.) Let this hang out while you prep everything else. Drain two 6-ounce cans or jars of tuna (packed in oil, ideally, but use what you\u2019ve got) and place in a medium bowl. Add 4 Tbsp. mayo, 1 Tbsp. prepared horseradish (or Dijon mustard), 2 minced pepperoncini (with brine\u2014or use any type of pickle, including kimchi), and a few dashes of green hot sauce (or red, if that\u2019s what\u2019s on hand). Season with lots of salt and pepper and mix and mash with a fork until well combined and the tuna is in small flakes. Add the soaked shallots and the juice and mixy-mix again. I like this on toasted whole wheat (more mayo on that, of course) with a slab of iceberg, but you could put it on a saltine from the quarantine stash and pat yourself on the back for that decision.Yes, there may be UFOs flying overhead and things have never been weirder, but I\u2019m pretty sure the world isn\u2019t going to end just yet. Whatever you stocked up on is yours for the taking, and popping the lid on a can of tuna is a smart and sane meal choice. It\u2019s economic, it\u2019s time-efficient, it\u2019s tasty as hell. It\u2019s tuna time, and it\u2019s not a surrender.Get more tinned fish recipes right here...Explore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterTunaRead MorecookingIt\u2019s Called TOTES Toast: Tuna, Olives, Tomato, Eggs, ShallotBy Emily SchultzcookingTinned Fish + Avocado = A Creamy, Dreamy Dip That Has Never Let Me DownBy Hilary CadigancookingYour Tuna Sandwich Has Been Waiting Its Whole Life For Green Goddess DressingBy Andy BaraghanicookingThis Easy Tuna Pasta Is the Cheapest, Quickest, Most Comforting Weeknight Dinner EverBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
