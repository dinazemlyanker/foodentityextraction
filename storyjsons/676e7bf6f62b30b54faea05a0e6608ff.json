So we\u2019ve turned to trusted health and safety experts to help answer some of our most pressing questions.By Jesse SparksApril 13, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Laura MurrayFacebookTwitterEmailAs the number of reported coronavirus cases increase and stay-at-home mandates are extended, many of us are turning to our kitchens. Cooking isn\u2019t just a way to nourish ourselves in these uncertain times, but something to ground us too\u2014which may explain why you\u2019ve made enough beans to fill a kiddie pool. Yet even this source of comfort comes with its own questions: Can coronavirus be spread through food? How should I shop for groceries now? Every day we\u2019re learning new information and in turn identifying new concerns, so we consulted virologists and food scientists to better understand how to safely buy groceries and cook. The rules are constantly changing, so make sure you consult the CDC and FDA for the most up-to-date information, but here\u2019s what we know so far.First things first: Can I get coronavirus by eating or touching food?\u201cCOVID-19 is a respiratory virus and is transmitted person-to-person through respiratory droplets,\u201d says Kali Kniel, Ph.D., a professor of animal and food sciences at the University of Delaware and the president of the International Association for Food Protection. \u201cIt is not likely to survive the acidity of the stomach in the way that foodborne bacteria and viruses are able to.\u201d Kniel also advises that currently \u201cthere is no evidence of food being associated with transmission of COVID-19, and this includes food-packaging materials and fresh produce.\u201dStill, because shopping can put us into contact with others, there are ways to limit your exposure and get what you need.Where do I start with grocery shopping during coronavirus?With staying at home becoming more encouraged, grocery delivery and pickup options are more widely available\u2014even for retailers that never offered them before. Stores like Target, Whole Foods, and Costco are giving customers curbside pickup and door-to-door shipment opportunities. Websites like Peapod, FreshDirect, and Amazon are still shipping with no-contact delivery. Plenty of independent purveyors will also deliver right to your door.Additionally, many local vendors who previously serviced only restaurants are now available for consumers. You can order meat, fish, and other food products to be shipped or delivered directly to your home with limited contact. While CSAs have been always around, more farmers have begun offering boxes of assorted produce for pre-order, on-farm pickup, and home delivery; check the websites of your local farmers market or farmers\u2019 association for additional details. Above all, if you\u2019re ordering groceries to be shipped or delivered, opt for no-contact delivery when you can.\u201cThese ways of obtaining food are good in that they support social distancing and reduce the potential for person-to-person transmission of the virus,\u201d Kniel says\u2014a reminder that merely limiting the amount of human contact significantly lowers the risk of contraction.If shopping in-person is a necessary and safe option for you\u2014and won\u2019t put others at risk\u2014it\u2019s possible to still visit stores at this time. But this isn\u2019t your moment to go to multiple locations in search of a specific ingredient or walk the aisles looking for inspiration. Instead, prepare by making a shopping list so you can get in and out quickly.\u201cWhen you go to the grocery store, have an idea of exactly what you want to get, which store you want to go to, and minimize your time there,\u201d says Matthew Moore, Ph.D., an assistant professor of food science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He also recommends shopping during off hours when the store is less likely to be busy and, if you are a senior citizen, using those shopping hours set aside for you. Of course, maintain your distance from other shoppers. \u201cAvoid going down an aisle with one or two people, or wait for them to leave before grabbing that food item you need,\u201d he says.If I go shopping, what should I take with me?If you\u2019re planning to use a shopping cart or basket, take sanitizing wipes to clean handles and a portable bottle of hand sanitizer to use after touching surfaces like freezer door handles, credit card readers, etc. Moore advises that sanitizer should be made up of 60 to 70 percent alcohol. A higher alcohol content means that the product is more likely to evaporate before it has time to adequately disinfect your hands. Water in the disinfectant actually helps break down and dissolve bacteria proteins.As of Friday, April 3, the CDC shifted its stance on masks and began encouraging everyone to wear them in public as a way to prevent those without symptoms from inadvertently spreading the virus. \u201cIdeally, everyone wearing masks could potentially reduce the transmission,\u201d Moore says. \u201cBut it is better to save [medical masks] for people in healthcare or who are giving care to high-risk individuals\u201d since an increased demand may impact the medical field, which is already facing severe mask shortages.Cloth masks, which are also effective, are becoming more available for purchase, and you can even make them at home. Kniel advises not touching or adjusting the mask while wearing it and routinely cleaning with soap and warm water or in a washer and dryer.Is there a certain way I should be interacting with items in the store?Generally, it\u2019s safe to handle fruits and vegetables in the produce section, packaged meat from the butcher counter, and any other product as you normally would, Moore says. \u201cAn apple is not a high-contact surface like a doorknob or credit card machine,\u201d he adds. \u201cThose frequently contacted surfaces are the concern.\u201dThat said, you\u2019re likely still touching those high-contact surfaces while shopping, so use hand sanitizer and avoid touching your face. When you get home, make sure you wash your hands with soap and water.Do I need to sanitize all my purchases?Although there is data to prove that the virus can survive on surfaces for one to three days, surface transmission shouldn\u2019t be your main concern, according to Kniel. These small particles generally aren\u2019t strong enough to make someone sick. You\u2019ve probably seen (or been tagged in by a well-intentioned friend or family member) viral videos on social media calling for people to wash produce with soap. While that seems like a safe practice, it\u2019s unnecessary and can actually make you sick.\u201cThere is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 through fruits and vegetables,\u201d Kniel says. \u201cWhile it is always important to rinse the outside of fruits and vegetables with water and to remove the outer layers of things like lettuce or cabbage before eating, consumers should not wash produce with soap. No one wants to, or should, eat soap.\u201dInstead, stick to the basics of hygiene, advises Martin Wiedmann, DVM, Ph.D., and a professor at the Institute for Food Safety at Cornell University, and wipe down or sanitize food as you normally would. Unpack and put away groceries; wipe down kitchen counters, tables, and any other surfaces where you may have placed uncooked meat or soiled produce bags, first with water and then disinfectant wipes; and, finally, wash your hands. As for reusable shopping bags, experts recommend washing them if they haven\u2019t been cleaned recently.Do I need to clean and disinfect my kitchen after shopping?These two practices are key, and part of basic everyday food safety procedures, Moore says. Though not specific to grocery shopping during coronavirus, they play an important role in your overall health by decreasing the likelihood of contracting other illnesses or foodborne bacteria like salmonella. These could lead to a hospital visit, which can increase your risk of coming into contact with people who may be carrying COVID-19.\u201cIt really is important to clean up afterward with soap and water before disinfecting with those 60 to 70 percent alcohol wipes,\u201d Moore says. Cleaning first allows you to strip away what scientists refer to as \u201corganic load\u201d (think residual soil or other residue), so that the disinfectant can be as effective as possible.Can I still cook for other people?As long as you have been practicing social distancing and routinely wash your hands, then cooking for others in your immediate household is safe, according to Linda J. Harris, Ph.D., professor of food science and technology at the University of California, Davis. \u201cUnlike foodborne gastrointestinal viruses, like norovirus and hepatitis A that make people ill through contaminated food, COVID-19 is a virus that causes respiratory illness,\u201d she says. \u201cThis virus is thought to spread mainly from person to person. Foodborne exposure to this virus is not known to be a route of transmission.\u201d But if you suspect you might be sick or have been in contact with someone who is, you should avoid cooking for others as a precaution, she says.Wiedmann agrees: \u201cCOVID-19 is not a foodborne virus,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you talk to scientists, they\u2019ll never say never, but it\u2019s so unlikely that someone would transmit it through contact with food.\u201dDoes a certain cooking temperature kill coronavirus?\u201cApplying heat will kill the virus,\u201d Harris says. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have data for this particular virus to be able to recommend a specific time or temperature.\u201dWill we run out of food?\u201cThe food supply chain is working, and there is no shortage of food, so there is no need to overstock,\u201d Kniel says. Empty grocery store shelves are only an indication that the recent demand for those goods has surpassed what stores initially planned for. It\u2019s not a permanent shortage. But we get it\u2014this is a really stressful and uncertain time, and being appropriately stocked can ease that anxiety. However, others need to get their essential groceries as well, so Kniel recommends buying only what you need for two weeks.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCoronavirusRead MorecultureSay You\u2019re Stuck at Home for Two Weeks\u2026By Carla Lalli MusiccultureFrom Pandemic to Protests: How Food Businesses Are RespondingBy The Bon App\u00e9tit StaffCoronavirus3 Things to Make You Feel Better About Cooking at HomeBy Carla Lalli MusicRecipes you want to make.
