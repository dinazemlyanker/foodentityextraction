To serve, place your aioli-slathered toast at the bottom of your bowl before loading it up with clams, beans, and crispy Serrano ham\u2014it will soak up the flavorful broth to ensure you don\u2019t miss a drop. Says Andy Baraghani: \u201cI don\u2019t even use utensils for this meal. I get in there with my hands and end up with clam broth all over my beard.

Arrange half of ham in pot in a single layer and cook, turning once or twice, until crisp, about 3 minutes. Using tongs, transfer to paper towels, leaving any fat in pot behind, and let drain. Repeat with remaining ham. Set aside.Step 2Add onions and garlic to same pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened but without taking on any color, about 3 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and paprika and cook, stirring often, until paste deepens to a dark brick red, about 2 minutes. Pour in wine and cook until reduced by half, 2\u20133 minutes. Add clams, cover pot, and cook, shaking pot occasionally, until clams open, 3\u20137 minutes, depending on their size. Transfer clams to a large bowl with a slotted spoon as they open; discard any that don\u2019t open.Step 3Reduce heat to medium-low. Add beans to pot and stir, letting beans soak up some of the clam broth, until warmed through, 1\u20132 minutes. Return clams to pot and remove from heat. Scatter half of parsley over and toss well.Step 4Slather aioli over toasts and place in bowls. Ladle clam mixture over toast. Top with remaining parsley. Crush reserved crispy ham and scatter over.Excerpted with permission from \u2018The Cook You Want to Be: Everyday Recipes to Impress\u2019 Copyright \u00a9 2022 by Andy Baraghani.
