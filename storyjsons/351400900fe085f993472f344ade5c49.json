Constantly repositioning the meat relative to the fire ensures that the strip side gets most of the heat while the tenderloin stays protected, and the plattered steak looks like a marvelous meaty magic trick. In the sauce, pickled green peppercorns (find them here) give a softer punch than black, plus chewy pops of texture. Their bright floral aroma is ideal for this summery riff on steak au poivre, but if you can\u2019t find them, just use half the amount of black peppercorns.Ingredients2\u20134 servingsVegetable oil (for grill)2Tbsp. drained pickled green peppercorns, plus more for serving\u00bdcup (packed) basil leaves\u00bdcup (packed) mint leaves\u00bdcup extra-virgin olive oilKosher salt12 lb. porterhouse steak (about 2\" thick), preferably prime or as well-marbled as you can findPreparationStep 1Prepare a grill for high indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off); oil grate with vegetable oil. Coarsely chop 2 Tbsp. peppercorns, then coarsely chop basil and mint right on top of peppercorns. Transfer to a small bowl and mix in olive oil; season with salt. Coarsely chop a few more peppercorns and set aside for serving.Step 2Season steak generously with salt. Grill over direct heat, keeping tenderloin (the smaller side) away from the most intense heat and turning steak about every minute or so to control flare-ups and ensure even browning, until deeply browned on all sides (including standing it on its side with tongs to render and brown fat around edges), 6\u20138 minutes.Step 3Move steak over indirect heat (still positioning tenderloin side away from the heat) and grill, turning every 1\u20132 minutes and moving closer to or farther away from heat as needed to build even color, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of steak registers 120\u00b0 for medium-rare, 10\u201312 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet and let rest 15\u201330 minutes.Step 4Transfer to a cutting board and cut meat away from each side of the bone, then slice crosswise. Serve topped with sauce and reserved peppercorns.How would you rate Porterhouse With Summer Au Poivre Sauce?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleReally great!AnonymousDetroit, MI5/28/2021This is a lovely recipe, made it last night. If you can't find pickled green peppercorns but can find dried at your local supermarket, you can pickle them yourself, in equal parts white vinegar and boiling salted water.
