Dense, seedy slices of rye. Holey, tangy loaves of sourdough. But sometimes, only the squishy sweetness of a King\u2019s Hawaiian roll will do.The appeal comes from the balance of texture and flavor: The sweetness delicately offsets any salty sandwich fillings, like ham and cheese, while its fluff envelops those fillings into itself and is just fun to bite. The recipe is based on Portuguese sweet bread, which is super rich from plenty of eggs, butter, and sugar. And, in case you\u2019re wondering, yes! King\u2019s Hawaiian really did start in Hawaii. Legend (a.k.a. the brand\u2019s FAQ section) has it that Hawaii native Robert Taira started baking batches of these doughy breads in Hilo in the 1950s, before moving the operation to Honolulu, then California, where he rolled out distribution nationwide.Fried chicken sandwiches are just better with King\u2019s Hawaiian rolls.\nPhoto by Laura MurrayOf course, a lot of the appeal comes down to nostalgia. To have eaten King\u2019s Hawaiian rolls as a child is to love King\u2019s Hawaiian rolls as an adult. Growing up, I ate the buns on their own, pulling them apart into soft, glutinous tufts to savor each bite. (Back then, I also swore the sweetness came from pineapple, but it\u2019s not listed as an ingredient...so that was probably just an overactive imagination.)I\u2019ve since evolved to use these rolls as an ingredient. Their status as a semi-regular grocery store staple makes them a summer cook-out essential, perfect for contrasting crispy fried chicken and pickle-y slaw. In the winter, I use them to soak up savory braises and stews, plus the occasional jambon beurre. But still, I\u2019ll always save a few rolls to snack on straight up, albeit lightly toasted and smeared with butter.
