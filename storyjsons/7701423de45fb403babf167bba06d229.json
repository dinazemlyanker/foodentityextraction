I\u2019m an Indian chef making Indian street food, and I can\u2019t help but let Western-centric technique and aesthetic creep into my preparation and plating. I feel the all-seeing social media eye that\u2019s endlessly judging, commenting, and reposting, knowing that its approval can make or break my restaurant. That reflex you have to ooh when a dish is placed before you and thumb Instagram open on your phone? Well, I see you doing that from the kitchen and it confirms that what my food looks like is just as important as what it tastes like.It took a global pandemic and being stuck at home for me to cook for flavor not fanfare. It happened when I decided to do a weekly live cooking show on, of all places, Instagram. For the first one I picked a simple curry recipe to demo since that\u2019s what I was making for dinner. As my wife held the iPhone and my teenage daughter looked on, it dawned on me that neither they nor anyone at home were looking for someone to wow them with culinary virtuosity. All they wanted from me was a delicious meal\u2014and the confidence to recreate it themselves.In the outpouring of comments, what struck me was how people loved the fun I was having, that I wasn\u2019t trying to \u201cchef up\u201d dishes, and that I was dealing with the same challenges as them. As I continued to cook and post online, making crispy onion pakoras and spicy Goan fish curry, I found myself doing it not for likes but to bring comfort to others. The pressure to impress, which felt so crucial as a chef, now seemed meaningless as a dad, a husband, and a home cook.When my restaurants reopen, I don\u2019t want to cook like a chef anymore. I realize that the way a dish is reviewed or photographed isn\u2019t supposed to make you feel a certain way\u2014the act of cooking is. And I had forgotten what that felt like.Meherwan Irani is the chef and founder of Chai Pani Restaurant Group and Spicewalla in Asheville, NC.\u00a0Explore Bon App\u00e9titFirst PersonCoronavirusRead MoreLifestyleMeherwan Irani Wants to Change Stereotypes About the South, Starting With DinnerBy Elyse InamineRecipes you want to make.
