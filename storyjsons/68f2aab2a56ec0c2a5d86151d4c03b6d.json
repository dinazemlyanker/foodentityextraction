We created this Spiced Pear and Bourbon cocktail that will be perfect for any holiday, celebration, or chilly Tuesday evening. The spiced pear syrup is the star of the show and starts with a high-quality pear juice simmered with ginger, cinnamon, and a hint of cloves. \u00a0As a sweetener for the syrup we like to use Swerve because it measures just like sugar, so it\u2019s easy to use in any recipe. In this cocktail, we went for Brown Swerve to really help add a rich caramel flavor that marries perfectly with the pear and warm fall spices. The final cocktail only has six carbs per serving but is still bursting with flavor! We hope you like it! It\u2019s Peary good.IngredientsSpiced Pear and Bourbon Sparkler1\u00bd ounces Spiced Pear Simple Syrup1\u00bd ounces Bourbon\u00bdounces lemon juice1-2ounces ProseccoIceChilled Coupe GlassSpiced Pear Simple Syrup1cup pear juice (not from concentrate or 3 ripe pears blitzed in a blender with \u00bc cup of water)2-inch nub of ginger2cinnamon sticks5cloves\u00bccup Brown SwervePreparationFirst start with the star of the show, the Spiced Pear Simple Syrup. In a pot combine 1 cup pear juice (not from concentrate or 3 ripe pears blitzed in a blender with 1/4 cups of water), a 2-inch nub of ginger peeled and sliced, 2 cinnamon sticks, and 5 cloves. Cover and let simmer over low heat for ten minutes. Take off the heat and add 1/4 cup lightly packed Brown Swerve. Stir until the Swerve is fully incorporated into the mixture. Let cool, and strain. You can make this in advance and store in the refrigerator for up to one week.For the cocktail, pour the Bourbon, Spiced Pear Simple Syrup, lemon juice (if using freshly squeezed make sure you strain the juice to avoid getting any seeds in your cocktail), and ice into a cocktail shaker and shake for 30 seconds or until the surface of the cocktail shaker is cool to the touch. Strain the drink over a chilled coupe glass, and top with the Prosecco of your choice.Recipe by Lisa Clark and Erika Radford of the BoozyKetonesWant more?

Glad this was the first cocktail; I have zero interest in reading the other 36 at this point.AnonymousSan Francisco, CA11/25/2021This is clearly spon con but not labeled as such. Bon Appetit, where have your standards gone?!Anonymous11/18/2021What a tasty cocktail! I used fresh pears for the syrup since they are in season and simmered with a premade mix of mulling spices. I substituted regular brown sugar for Swerve since I am not tracking carbs. I would make this again as a batch cocktail for a party next year.AmandaDenton, TX12/20/2020Recipes you want to make.
