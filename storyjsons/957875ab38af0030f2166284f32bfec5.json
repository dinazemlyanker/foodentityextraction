When something's so easy to make that you don't even need one. Welcome to It's That Simple, a column where our staffers talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks that they can make with their eyes closed. This week: last-minute cocoa almonds!The holiday season is a marathon. Tonight is another party, but this time you didn\u2019t have time to make cookies, or bake a cake, or run out to buy a bottle of nice wine for your hosts. You wish you did\u2014you just...didn\u2019t. Well, guess what? This is the perfect time to make these super-simple cocoa almonds\u2014my favorite last-minute edible gift that is comprised of just five ingredients, and comes together in 15 minutes. I repeat: 15 minutes!First things first: Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0. Spread 2 cups of whole raw almonds on a sheet tray and pop them in the oven for about 10 minutes, making sure to give them a toss at about the halfway mark so that they toast evenly. You can tell when they're really done by giving them a sniff\u2014they should smell roasty-toasty and delicious. (You can use already-roasted almonds, but you'll still need to pop them in the oven to heat up a bit; they need to be warm for the coating to stick.) Once your nuts are nicely toasted, transfer them to a medium heat proof bowl and drizzle over 3 tablespoons of maple syrup and \u00bd teaspoon vanilla extract. Toss them vigorously until each almond is coated and shiny, which will take about two minutes\u2014be patient!Not an almond fan? Other nuts will work here too\u2014just keep an eye on the roasting time.\nPhoto by Ted CavanaughOnce the almonds are all glossy, use a fine mesh strainer to sift 3 tablespoons of powdered sugar over them. (This is my favorite part because powdered sugar is like the sweet equivalent to snow\u2014sing a little Christmas jingle while it floats down over Almond Town!) Now, toss the almonds thoroughly again until each nut is evenly coated in a thick, sugary coating. Dump them back onto the same sheet tray you used to toast them, spread them out, and let them hang out for a few minutes so the syrup has a bit of time to set. Then grab your fine mesh strainer again and sift 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder over the almonds, tossing with your hands to make sure they're evenly coated. And just like that: You're done! If this isn't a good enough reason to start buying almonds in bulk, I don't know what is.The cocoa almonds are best if you let them cool completely before storing in an airtight container, but if you\u2019re in a real hurry you can just go ahead and pack them up (they\u2019ll be cool by the time you get to that party). I love to pack them in a Mason jar and tie a little red ribbon around the lid\u2014a little flair to show you care. And there you have it: a cocoa almond recipe that will ensure you never show up empty-handed to a holiday party ever gain.Looking for a savory edible gift?
