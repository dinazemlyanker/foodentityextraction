Choose your own meat from the packed deli case. If you can\u2019t make up your mind, the salami and roast beef are tops (the latter is a $2 upgrade, but you\u2019re worth it). Yes to the pesto mayo, yes to the oil and vinegar, and heck yes to the banana peppers and pickled eggplant.THE VIBE IS: just what you\u2019d expect from a well-established deli run by Italian immigrants for decades: no-nonsense service; shelves packed with European imports of every kind, including hundreds of panettone around Christmas; a ceiling painted to look like the sky; and a large tub of Baci chocolates next to the register.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day: Monday to Thursday and Saturday, from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Friday, from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.; and Sunday, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Visit midmorning or slightly later in the afternoon to avoid the lunchtime rush (which includes many hungry construction workers).
