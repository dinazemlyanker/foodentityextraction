I was 16, working on the line alongside a much wiser cook named Tamar Adler (who went on to write An Everlasting Meal). After spooning warm brandade onto toast, she braced her plastic, mint-green mandoline against her cutting board and slid a fennel bulb against the stainless-steel blade. The bulb gave way immediately into feathery, sheer wisps\u2014the visual and textural topper I didn\u2019t even know the dish needed. A decade, five restaurants, and three test kitchens later, I can say without a doubt that, after my chef\u2019s knife, the mandoline is the tool I reach for most. With a swipe against the sharp blade, veggies that are otherwise a pain to prep turn easily into uniform, thin slices. Raw fibrous beets are transformed into translucent disks. Cucumbers become paper-thin ribbons. A mandoline takes your cooking to a whole new aesthetic level (now you know how chefs make salad look so good).\u00a0Super Benriner Mandoline$96 at Amazon$75 at Sur La TableBenriner, which has been making mandoline slicers since the 1940s, is the best in my opinion. This Japanese mandoline isn\u2019t just more efficient than a knife; it does things no knife can do. Benriner updated the design in 2018, and although it\u2019s a little flashier than the one Tamar kept in her kit, it\u2019s still easy to use\u2014even if you\u2019re a beginner home cook\u2014and sharp as hell. (You can also find the old version on Amazon at bargain prices.) The new Benriner handheld mandoline\u2014which comes in Classic, Super, and Jumbo sizes\u2014has an adjustable straight blade. With a twist of a knob on the underside, you can tweak the thickness setting depending on whether you want razor-thin garlic or thicker potato rounds for a gratin. Also included are three julienne blades of different thicknesses so you can slice carrots into delicate matchsticks for gado-gado rolls or potatoes for french fries. When the blades gets dull, just unscrew the knobs on either side to remove and swap them out\u2014a nice money-saving feature compared to other vegetable slicers with non-replaceable blades.\u00a0Benriner Mandoline (Old Version)$34 at AmazonA note on safety: Mandoline blades are no joke, so make sure you hold whatever you\u2019re slicing in your palm with your fingertips out of the way. Or use the Benriner\u2019s sturdy hand guard, which grips food on one side and protects your fingers on the other. And if you\u2019re still nervous about those blades, get yourself a pair of cut-resistant gloves.Cut Resistant Gloves$13 $11 at Amazon3 ways to use a mandoline:Rounds: Circles of cukes, beets, kohlrabi, or radishes make a crunchy salad base or chic garnish, depending on what slice thickness you select. If you want to attempt homemade potato chips, this is your cut.Ribbons: Anything oblong\u2014carrots, zucchini\u2014goes from unwieldy to elegant faster than a makeover montage.Matchsticks: The scary blades with teeth-like prongs are for shredding and making julienne cuts\u2014but if you lose those extra blades, you can always just shave your veg into slices, stack, turn, and slice again with a knife.Use your mandoline to make this now:Asian Pear Salad With Peanut-Lime DressingThis sweet-tart salad gets its satisfying crisp-crunchy texture from floral Asian pears and nutty raw cauliflower.View RecipeThe other tool Andy can\u2019t live without?This piece was originally published in 2017 and updated in 2021.Explore Bon App\u00e9titToolsmandolineShoppingBA RecommendsStaff PicksRead MoreshoppingThe Tool That Changed the Way I CookBy Andy BaraghaniRecipes you want to make.
