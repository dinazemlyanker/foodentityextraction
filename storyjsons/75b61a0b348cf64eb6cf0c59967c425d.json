Our hands-off method delivers on two counts: It browns the beef, then cooks it until the meat is fall-apart tender. A low oven temp is crucial: It allows the coconut milk to gradually evaporate until it\u2019s thick and saucy.Ingredients4 servings\u2153cup unsweetened coconut flakes3lb. 1\u00bd\u20132\"-thick cross-cut beef short ribs (flanken style; well-marbled works best)Kosher salt2lemongrass stalks1shallot, chopped4garlic cloves2red Fresno chiles or jalape\u00f1os, seeds removed11\" piece ginger, peeled, finely grated113.5-oz. can unsweetened coconut milk1Tbsp. curry powder1cup cilantro leaves with tender stems2Tbsp. fresh lime juiceSteamed white rice (for serving)PreparationStep 1Place a rack in middle of the oven; preheat to 250\u00b0. Spread out coconut flakes on a rimmed baking sheet and toast until golden, 10\u201315 minutes. Let cool.Step 2Meanwhile, season beef generously with salt and set aside. Trim top three-quarters from lemongrass stalks and place top portions in a large cast-iron skillet or heavy roasting pan. Peel outer layers from root end and finely grate into a blender. Add shallot, garlic, chiles, ginger, coconut milk, and curry powder; pur\u00e9e until smooth.Step 3Arrange short ribs, bone side up, in skillet; pour pur\u00e9e over. Roast until meat is halfway to tender and liquid is reduced by two-thirds (it will look slightly oily and broken, and this is exactly what you want), 3\u20133\u00bd hours. Turn ribs onto their sides and continue to roast, adding water by \u00bc-cupfuls if liquid in skillet looks in danger of burning or getting very dark, until meat is fork-tender and liquid is a jammy glaze, 2\u20132\u00bd hours longer.Step 4Toss coconut, cilantro, lime juice, and a pinch of salt in a small bowl. Top short ribs with gremolata and serve with rice.How would you rate Short Ribs Slow-Roasted in Coconut Milk?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (7)Back to TopTriangleWhen I roast the ribs, do I cover them with foil? Sounds like a long time to roast uncovered and likely to get dry \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0fLuluMelbourne, Australia7/17/2021Luscious.  Tastes so good it feels like you probably shouldn't be eating it!\nAnonymousTexas10/24/2020Made this last night for 6 of us and we all devoured it.  Only added a few more chillis and served it with Pad Thai.  The left over beef will be shredded in big chunks and added to rice with the sticky jammy saucy leftovers.  Honestly one of the best and most spectacular flavours we've eaten in a while.  Definitely making this again and will share the recipe with family members. Tracy WilkinsonAustralia 9/11/2019For a nice occasion, these short ribs on rice were perfect. Making them was a fun experience. Fun to braise something in southeast asian ingredients. SO good to eat, too. AnonymousCalifornia3/24/2019i'm no fan of coconut in savory dishes; it just detracts, for ME.  so this recipe caught me by surprise.  when i can next afford short ribs, i will look to this recipe for the garlic, ginger, lemongrass, chilies (WITH seeds), and ALL THAT CILANTRO!!! -- that will be HEAVENLY!hollis5Vero Beach, FL3/16/2019OMG this was incredible. Since I was a dummy and didn\u2019t read through the instructions before starting (5+ hours!? Holy crap) I seared the ribs first than cooked at 350 for 45min before covering and cooking at 300 for another 2 hours. I made coconut rice to go with. It feel off the bone, the fat was delicious and edible. Oh man I\u2019ll be making this again. Also!! Just quickly cook the sauce on the stove top at the end if it hasn\u2019t gone jammy yet to bring the oil and solids back together.bigelow_katelouiSan Francisco 10/15/2018Very good.   If you own a high end blender like a vitamix, skip the grating of lemon grass and just blend everything.    DO get RED Chilis for this.    I used a green jalape\u00f1o and flavor wise it was great but presentation suffered.    One pepper works for those wishing to keep spice levels down.      Gremolita was good.   I suggest using it at the table rather than sprinkling over whole dish.
