He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.A bunch of us were out west last week for our annual Vegas Uncork\u2019d by Bon App\u00e9tit food festival and by the time I woke up Friday morning, ordered my room-service coffee (hot whole milk on side, please), and turned on SportsCenter, Alex Delany was already long gone.I know this because Delany, like so many staffers at BA, broadcasts his every eating adventure on his Instagram account. And it is this intrepid, always-be-sharing spirit that fuels our latest digital series, Highly Recommend.Like some Ron Burgundy Channel 4 News Team feature, wherever our editors go, we take you there! Like, literally.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Isn\u2019t that long list of wines at The Ten Bells romantic?\nPhoto by Charles BillotEvery weekday, another Highly Recommend post drops on bonappetit.com. It could be our social media director Rachel Karten tipping you off to the best first-date spot in New York City (hint: it features A+ lighting, plenty of natural wine, and optional food). Or maybe it\u2019s colleague Christina Chaey, who didn\u2019t know she loved pie until she loved the chocolate chess pie at Fiona in West Hollywood.Whatever the subject of that day\u2019s post, you can expect concise, to-the-point recommendations infused with a healthy amount of attitude and personality\u2014like you\u2019re hanging out with our editors at the bar and they\u2019re telling you what they\u2019re digging on these days.You\u2019ll never fly the same way again.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigIn fact, it doesn\u2019t even always have to be a restaurant or a bar. Basically editor Amiel Stanek shares what airline he flies just for the small-batch margarita mix it carries, which he marries not with tequila, but whiskey. While senior staff writer Alex Beggs lets you in on the pair of clogs that\u2019ll make you feel like a test kitchen professional.Inspired by BA\u2019s own Carla Lalli Music.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigOh, and Alex Delany? He snuck off to Vesta Coffee in Vegas for his daily cortado fix, and then to Makers and Finders for crispy breakfast empanadas, which made the rest of us mighty jealous. They\u2019re exactly the kind of spots you can expect our editors to write up for Highly Recommend.
