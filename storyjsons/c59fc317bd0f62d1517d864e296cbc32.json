And there\u2019s restaurant merch you need to have. For me, everything at Philadelphia\u2019s premier sandwich shop Middle Child falls in the latter category, starting with this rad T-shirt. Chef and co-owner Matt Cahn tapped local artist Eric Kenney, who goes by the name Heavy Slime, for the illustration and Press & Release Printing to make it.The shirt ($30) is sold only at the shop, and it\u2019s as essential as a sandwich order. (We also like their tote!) That\u2019s because wearing it is a declaration that you\u2019re in on the fact that such a place exists, where the sandwiches are always of the highest quality (short rib corned beef Reuben!) and lunches are never depressing. Plus, there\u2019s a cute, recognizable little smiley face, both on the front and the back, which will elicit a Go Birds! from any in-the-know Philly native. Wear it proudly.Go there: Middle ChildExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsPhiladelphiaShoppingRead MorecultureWhat Does Your Restaurant Tote Say About You?By Alex DelanycultureThe Hottest New Streetwear Brand Is Actually a RestaurantBy Emilia PetrarcaRecipes you want to make.
