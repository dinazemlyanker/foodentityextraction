It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.I\u2019m the first person who will tell you that when tomatoes are good, you really don\u2019t have to do much to them. Some salt, a little olive oil\u2014that\u2019s a tomato salad. You\u2019re done. Got a basil sprig and some mozz? Cool: now you\u2019ve got a caprese. But when peak tomato week hits, it\u2019s time to go glam. For runway-ready tomatoes, make this juicy, herby, tangy, crunchy, spiced-up situation right here.This salad is like a fattoush, but without the cucumbers. It\u2019s like panzanella, without the giant croutons. It\u2019s Greek salad without the grape leaves. It\u2019s got all sizes of beautiful tomatoes cut into attractive halves and wedges. It\u2019s got planks (not crumbles, and not cubes\u2014planks) of crumbly feta. It\u2019s got a fragrant dressing built on za\u2019atar, the Middle Eastern dry spice made with sesame seeds and thyme and sumac and other things depending on who made it or where you got it. It\u2019s got a little lemon to dial up the natural acidity of the tomatoes, honey to amplify their sweetness, and garlic to coax out their savory flavors. It has it all.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!It\u2019s also got pita chips. Stacy\u2019s \u201cSimply Naked\u201d pita chips are the unofficial official pita chip of the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen since forever. I don\u2019t know much about Stacy or where she learned her craft, but that woman knows her way around a pita chip, and I appreciate the use of the word \u201cnaked\u201d in a product name. Her chips are very important to this salad. Not only are they the ideal firm-but-shattery texture, but they are also exquisitely salted. They absorb the tomato juices and dressing in a unique way, so that the pita rafts become semi-saturated but manage to stay crisp. It\u2019s a phenomenon the Bon App\u00e9tit editors like to refer to as \u201ccrispy-gone-soggy,\u201d but you will finish this salad before any sog happens. It\u2019s more of a \u201ccrispy-gone-soaked\u201d effect, like when you dip a just-fried tortilla chip into fresh pico de gallo.The recipe calls for a mix of heirlooms and cherry tomatoes, but you know what? Buy the best-looking, ripest, most fragrant tomatoes wherever you happen to be shopping, be it the farmers market or grocery store. Or pick them from your own garden, if that\u2019s your situation! I have found that sometimes field-grown beefsteaks are the best and most beautiful, and other times I suck it up and indulge myself in heirlooms, despite the $5 per pound price tag. Good tomatoes should smell like something when you press the skin against your nose and inhale, and they should feel heavy for their size, which means they are filled with juice and are not mealy.You will expend very little effort making this salad, and yet, it will be very beautiful. Doing all of the things we tell you to do may indeed make you feel that the recipe is a little fancy. One hundred percent of people who have made the salad would make it again; be encouraged. The tomatoes are worth it. You\u2019re worth it.Get the recipe:Fancy and Beautiful Tomato SaladHere\u2019s the first thing you should make when you want to show off the peak-season tomatoes you\u2019ve been waiting all year for.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterTomatoSaladRecipes you want to make.
