Have a question? Email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.My spouse is FREAKED OUT about mayo sitting in the sun, but I\u2019m not. Do I have to leave the egg salad at home? \u2014Curdled CarlDid you know that mayo has vinegar in it that actually PREVENTS microbial growth from happening? So it\u2019s not the mayo you should fear but the egg, tuna, or chicken you\u2019ve got bathing in it. The Department of Agriculture gives you a two-hour time limit on leaving those out of the fridge, but a few of us at BA have been known to extend that, shh.Illustration by Cari Vander YachtWhat is the best way to camouflage booze when you technically shouldn\u2019t have it in the park? \u2014Incognito IvyThe capital-B best way? Paint the wine bottle with Elmer\u2019s rubber cement and then carefully apply sticks and leaves until it blends in with the landscape. Don\u2019t have an artist\u2019s eye? I pour (non-sparkling) wine or prebatched Negronis into a Corkcicle canteen, which keeps it cold for hours.I picked a nice shaded isolated spot to picnic with my family by a lake, but another group showed up and sat waaay too close to us. Now what?! \u2014Socially Distant SanjayOooooh the shady spot by the LAKE. I can see why you don\u2019t want to gather your blanket and move along. Time for what I call Gentle Confrontation. Kindly address your intruders, \u201cHi there! I\u2019m so sorry to bother you, but we\u2019re still a bit spooked about germs given that whole thing. I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but would it be possible to shift your blanket a few yards to the right?\u201d Keep your tone warm and a little desperate. If they get hostile, move over yourself\u2014no huffing!\u2014and double down on having a good time.Illustration by Cari Vander YachtWe adhere to a strict picnic rule: no disposable products. Can we ask our friends to do the same when we picnic together, or should we supply these items for them? \u2014Optimistic OpalYou\u2019re doing a good thing, keep doing that. I\u2019d bring silverware for everyone to avoid the whole kerfuffle. Because this is the kind of tiny issue that snowballs the more time you dwell on it. If you\u2019re sitting and stewing over a friend\u2019s plastic spork, grudging and judging, you\u2019re misplacing your outrage. Direct that at the larger forces to blame for earth-ruining out there, like ExxonMobil. Enjoy this time with the people who make you happy; the cutlery isn\u2019t going to help you clean out a flooded basement or dispose of a body. You know, the stuff real friends do.Illustration by Cari Vander YachtHow do you keep all the random dogs people brought from eating the food? \u2014More-of-a-Cat-Person MinSeeing a soft-eared canine running off with my perfectly charred Ball Park Frank is just the trigger to unravel a month\u2019s worth of self-help podcasts. But as with toddlers and Labatt-drunk boyfriends, you can\u2019t tell a person how to control their creature. You can pull this line out, though: \u201cOh hey, Stefani? Is there a command or something I can say to keep Captain Peppercorn from stealing the franks?\u201d Maybe she\u2019ll step in to do something. Maybe.I\u2019ve gotten caught bringing something to a picnic and then eating it all myself. So now I just bring two vegetarian calzones or whatever so I can share one and still have one for myself (I\u2019m an only child, shut up). Is that acceptable? \u2014Single-Serving SylviaI\u2019m a middle child, YOU shut up! I cherish my friends\u2019 weirdo tendencies, but you can\u2019t keep something for yourself and then turn around and smash on my Fritos Scoops. A picnic is inherently a sharing event, unless you have a food allergy or it\u2019s the midst of a global pandemic, in which case, NO SHARING. But in normal times, bring something that everyone can easily enjoy (is the calzone sliced? I have so many questions). How about a pitcher of sweet tea. Or a bucket of sour cream and onion dip. Personal growth comes in many forms. Dip is one of the best.Illustration by Cari Vander YachtWhat are the best Bon App\u00e9tit recipes to bring to a picnic? \u2014Subscribin\u2019 ShermanBasically\u2019s Big Ass Beach HoagieNo-Brainer Corn SaladSpicy Kimchi SlawBroccoli Salad With Peanut DressingCaramelized Shallot DipMasala Fried ChickenJammy Pepper Pasta SaladSalad RamenA mini tin of Maldon saltExplore Bon App\u00e9titEtiquetteIs It Ever OkayPicnicSummerRead MoreLifestyleThe Chicken Salad I\u2019m Eating on My Porch All SummerBy Christina ChaeycookingYour Summer Needs More Cottage CheeseBy Amiel StanekcookingThe Pasta Salad That Won\u2019t Get Weird at the PicnicBy Alex BeggscookingBet You Can\u2019t Eat Just One Slice of This Strawberry Snacking CakeBy Sarah JampelRecipes you want to make.
