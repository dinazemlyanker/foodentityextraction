See our past recommendations here!I\u2019m the kind of person who leaves something in their online cart for three months before clicking \u201cbuy.\u201d Pre-pandemic I would say things like, \u201cwe should hang out sometime,\u201d with no real plans to actually do so. And please don\u2019t ask me to choose a favorite nut butter. What I\u2019m trying to say is that I dread commitment. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve always purchased glasses that are on the cheaper side; there\u2019s no emotional (or financial) regret if I accidentally sit on them, decide they aren\u2019t my lewk anymore, or lose them deep in a tote-hole.Then last summer my optometrist informed me that because of my farsightedness my eyes were tensing up while looking at screens all day and that I should get reading glasses to help them relax a bit. Even better, doc said, was if I bought blue light glasses that could pull double-duty repelling those digitized wavelengths that can mess with our circadian rhythms (among a handful of more sinister suspected side effects). Was it finally time to invest in one nice pair of glasses rather than my environmentally ill-advised practice of buying loads of cheap options?When I found Eyebobs, a Minnesota-based company that makes super-sturdy and incredibly cute glasses, I knew the answer was yes. Their reviews proved reputable, and they had enough but not too many frame options for my easily daunted self. As an Ashkenazi Jew, styles like \u201cKvetcher\u201d really spoke to me, and the designs felt like a nice range\u2014from the more eclectic shapes like the \u201c1.21 Gigawatts\u201d to the more traditional like the \u201cWaylaid.\u201d For my first pair I went with the chic, cat-eye-shaped \u201cDorothy\u201d frames in tortoiseshell and I\u2019ve been wearing them all day, every day for the last six months. They still feel tight (regular glasses wearers will know the feeling of loose frames sliding down your nose all day!), chic enough for a compliment or two at the beginning of a Zoom meeting, and so comfortable that my eyes are relaxed at the end of a long day of computer-phone-television tag.\u201cWith blue light glasses and readers especially, we are constantly taking them on and off as we transition from in front of our computers and screens to playing with our kids or reading a book,\u201d explained Chelsey Wright, head of design at Eyebobs. \u201cThat opening and stretching can really wear glasses down, so we use a super durable hinge and luxury acetate in order to ensure the frame has a long life.\u201d We love a long life!Thanks to Eyebobs\u2019 focus on durability, I don\u2019t see myself needing to buy a new pair of blue light glasses any time soon. Though it saddens me not to rotate between all of their fun frames, I have to remind myself there are plenty of other ways I can imbue variety into my days. Now will it be almond, peanut, or pistachio butter toast today?Photograph by Emma FishmanDorothy Blue Light Glasses (Orange Tortoise)$89 at EyebobsExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish Loves ItShoppingRecipes you want to make.
