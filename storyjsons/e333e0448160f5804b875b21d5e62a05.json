The Garlickiest Fried Rice, he explained, was definitely one portion\u2014not four. His exact words: \u201cI would house that plate.\u201d Having made it myself, I can safely say that while he is technically incorrect, he is not wholly out of line. I had to apply some serious self restraint in order not to do exactly that.You start by making crunchy, golden, fried garlic chips, a pure genius condiment\u2014seriously, just try not to eat them all the moment you pull them from their hot, glistening oil. But Andy Baraghani, a very smart man and the mind behind the recipe, knew their purpose was twofold: To be an addictive topping with countless applications beyond this particular dish, and a necessary byproduct on the path to a garlic-infused oil used to cook everything else that goes in the dish. This way, garlic makes its aromatic, slightly spicy way into every single bite, taking the recipe from garlic fried rice to the garlickiest fried rice.So good, you could eat \u2019em straight.\nPhoto by Alex LauAfter the chips, you\u2019ll saut\u00e9 some ginger, scramble an egg, then dump some day-old, dried-out rice into the pan. (Those adjectives are important: \u201cday-old\u201d and \u201cdried-out\u201d mean the grains get properly crispy.) Toss in some scallions for bite, which will wilt and mellow just enough, and then lay it all out on a platter. Your work here is done after a scattering of chopped cilantro (for freshness), toasted sesame seeds, and, of course, the fried garlic chips. We won't tell if you cancel plans and feed yourself straight from the bowl.Get the recipe:The Garlickiest Fried RiceCrispy fried garlic on top, garlic oil leftover, and rice fried up in all of it.
