They were served a variety of southern favorites including steaming macaroni au gratin, fried green tomatoes with pimento cheese, and southern crab grits. But the focus of the evening was on the women serving the food and drinks.In celebration of Audi's new Q3, the carmaker launched PROOF, the Audi Culinary Dinner Series, which is a multi-city pop-up restaurant showcasing women chefs and graduates of the James Beard Foundation\u2019s Women\u2019s Entrepreneurial Leadership (WEL) Program, a program co-founded with Audi. Through WEL, luminaries of the culinary world like Christensen mentor aspiring female chefs, beverage managers, and food service workers in a pronounced effort to balance gender disparities in the hospitality industry. That night Christensen was joined by chefs Ann Marshall of the High Wire Distilling Company, in Charleston, South Carolina, and Joanne Canady-Brown of The Gingered Peach in Lawrenceville, New Jersey.Developed with Babson College, WEL invites up to 20 women to a five-day entrepreneurship and leadership training program. The curriculum covers strategy, finance, and leadership development, all with an eye on teaching work-life balance. When Christensen heard about the scholarships, \"It just recharged my batteries,\" she says. Now she makes sure, \"that when I'm in my community, I'm making myself accessible to young women who need resources.\u201dThe numbers tell the story. Women represent less than 20 percent of chefs and head cooks in the U.S.; only six percent of the head chef positions at the top 15 restaurant groups in the U.S. are held by women. Audi launched the series believing those statistics are simply unacceptable.Christensen was blessed to grow up in a house focused on cooking. Her father, a truck driver, would return from across the U.S. with new recipes to try. Her mother knew the southern American cookbook front to back and infused Christensen with those techniques, traditions, and flavor combinations.\"I feel best when I'm cooking,\" she says. But even Christensen says she can lose her inspiration from time to time. What brings it back? \"Cooking something I've never cooked before,\" she says. With resources like WEL, women who haven't established themselves in the culinary world can start doing the same.Christensen opened Poole's Diner in Raleigh, North Carolina, in December of 2007, growing the down-home spot into one of the most celebrated restaurants in the country. Today, she owns five other restaurants, and in 2017, she won Eater's Chef of the Year. Earlier this year, she earned the James Beard Outstanding Chef award, the Foundation\u2019s highest individual honor.That night in Nashville, when the napkins were back on the table and the plates cleared, Christensen took the microphone and reminded the room of the power of hard work and taking care of one another.\"I love going on the road and telling the story,\" she says.Recipes you want to make.
