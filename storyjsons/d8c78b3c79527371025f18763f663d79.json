Have a question? Email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.Can I bring my significant other to the company blowout? \u2014Significant SergioNah, thanks. This is your one chance to blow off a year\u2019s worth of coffee-breath-flavored steam with your trenchmates. Partners add an awkward couples cruise dynamic, not to mention they seem to unnecessarily highlight who has their conventional societal whatnot together and who is a wild and free bohemian.Illustration by Cari Vander YachtWhen can I commandeer the playlist? I\u2019m an experienced DJ\u2014it went over really well at my cousin\u2019s bat mitzvah. \u2014Bold BartYou need to have people on your side before you storm the DJ booth. Do you have the undying support of at least five others? Okay. But if they shake their heads saying, \u201cNo, man, I love these Kidz Bop versions of early 2000s R&B songs,\u201d then let the music in your head suffice.Can you avoid the boss altogether? Or at some point, do you need to go up to them and make small talk? \u2014Actually Adam RapoportHow often do you get face time with your boss? If this is an opportunity to remind them that you\u2019re human, not a number-crunching never-sick robot, you\u2019d better seize it. But the boss doesn\u2019t want to be cornered at the crudite\u0301s table while you lay out the plans for a new project you\u2019ve been plotting in the shower. Schedule a real meeting for that and use this encounter to find out if the boss is human too, not a number-obsessed corporate-controlled robot.Illustration by Cari Vander YachtWhat\u2019s the dress code situation? I want to get crazy! \u2014Fully Clothed FrankieTwo years ago contributing food editor Rick Martinez wore a stunning navy velvet tux jacket to the BA holiday party, and not a day goes by that I don\u2019t think about it. Dressing up is a nice (maybe even fun!) thing to do and a sign of respect and festivity, but no one is going to care if you show up in the same outfit you wore to work that day. However, if you feel like this is the prime time to break out that flesh-colored spandex jumpsuit with the pearlescent sequins that turn you into a giant betta fish, rock on. Like a velvet tux, I\u2019ll never forget it either.Is it cool if I leave the party early? Or not go at all... for four years in a row? \u2014Deterred DidiDon\u2019t skip it. It\u2019s humanizing and cathartic\u2014and your only window to pry into your coworkers\u2019 personal lives without seeming creepy. But it\u2019s such a good idea to leave early I\u2019d recommend WE ALL do it! That way you get free mini spanakopita and look like a team player but avoid any regrettable third-drink mistakes and get a full eight hours\u2019 sleep.Illustration by Cari Vander YachtSo you drank too much at the holiday party. How do you handle the next day? \u2014Hungover HarrietYou come in and show yourself! \u201cI\u2019m never doing shots again,\u201d you\u2019ll moan to your bleary-eyed colleagues, knowing you definitely will the second that tiny glass is in your clutches. Misery loves company. Bring a bag of egg-and-cheese sandwiches and a case of coconut water. Misery loves those too.Is it ever okay to do shots with your coworkers? \u2014Straight-Shooting SusanI plan on living out the rest of my days on this planet without ever doing shots again. And I suggest you do the same. Have you ever woken up the next day and thought, I\u2019m so glad I did shots last night! I feel amazing! I\u2019m going for a run! It\u2019s pure pain. And tequila didn\u2019t do all that work to be treated like this! No shots!Illustration by Cari Vander YachtWhat snacks can I eat with my hands versus utensils? \u2014Touchy TobyThe cocktail party appetizer eating guide:HANDS:\u2022 Arancini\u2022 Mini spanakopita\u2022 Shao mai\u2022 Sliders\u2022 Deviled eggs\u2022 Bruschetta\u2022 Pigs in a blanket\u2022 Bacon-wrapped datesUTENSILS:\u2022 Ceviche????How do I leverage my boss\u2019s inebriation to get a raise? \u2014Anonymous AlexTHIS NEVER WORKS.That\u2019s all for now, but if you have petty etiquette questions, recipe requests, or just want to tell me you think I\u2019m unfunny and WRONG, so wrong, about everything, please email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.Love,AlexExplore Bon App\u00e9titIs It Ever OkayEtiquetteHoliday 2019Recipes you want to make.
