Waiters will be handing plates of Basque-style seafood\u2014packed with olive oil, aioli, paprika, and fresh herbs. Everyone will be clinking glasses and having a good time. And if you scan the entirety of the restaurant, you will probably spot me\u2014sitting at the bar, eating pintxos, drinking vermouth, and also having a good time. Because while Ernesto\u2019s is great for many things, it is maybe the best for some of my most favorite things: Spanish bar snacks and drinks.Chef Ryan Bartlow takes his experience working at San Sebasti\u00e1n\u2019s Akelarre, a Michelin-starred restaurant serving ambitious seafood, and simplifies it on his own menu of Basque cuisine. That means croquetas filled with creamy, shredded chicken. Gildas stacked with raw tuna, green olives, and snappy pickled peppers. Toasted baguettes topped with perfectly cooked shrimp and peppers. And a pile of house-fried potato chips draped with thinly sliced jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico. These are proper bar snacks. Don\u2019t pick favorites. Embrace them all.And the same goes for the vermouth and wine lists. Bottles of Spanish natural wine from passionate, thoughtful importers, like Jos\u00e9 Pastor Selections and Selections de la Vi\u00f1a, are there. Vermouths from culty producers (Partida Creus!) are just as good sipped straight as they are with lemon juice and soda water. Whatever you choose, it will pair perfectly with those pintxos.Just because that\u2019s my move, doesn\u2019t mean it has to be yours. Maybe you make the warmly lit, flower-filled space into a temporary residence over a relaxed five-hour dinner. Maybe you stop by Ernesto\u2019s caf\u00e9 next door for coffee and pastries on Saturday mornings. Maybe you drink wine at the bar before heading to some other Lower East Side spot. Whatever you do, you know where to find me, perched at the bar, eating pintxos, and drinking vermouth all night long.Go there: Ernesto\u2019sExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsNew York CityRead MorerestaurantsThis Tortilla Espa\u00f1ola Is Like a Savory Molten Lava CakeBy Elyse InamineRecipes you want to make.
