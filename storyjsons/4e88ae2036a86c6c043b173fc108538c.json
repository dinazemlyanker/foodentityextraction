In her monthly column, nearly lifelong vegetarian Sarah Jampel will tackle cooking, eating, and navigating the world meat-free\u2014even when her grandma still doesn't know what she makes for dinner.My relationship with tempeh changed when I started to think of it more like bacon and less like steak: Instead of cooking it in big slabs that would take up the majority of the plate, I treat it as an accessory, adding flavor, texture, and the ever-elusive protein to my vegetarian dinners.So while you won\u2019t find me making tempeh burgers, you will find me snacking on walnut-sized crumbles when my plate is particularly vegetable-heavy and protein-light (like, when I\u2019ve taken the time to make pan-roasted romanesco and haven\u2019t thought beyond that). Glazed with a sticky and spicy honey-sambal sauce, they\u2019re good enough to eat by the handful and versatile enough to go on top of what I\u2019ve already put together, like these peanutty noodles.Tem-pay (not tem-pee, as in the city in Arizona) originated in Java several centuries ago and spread to other parts of the world in the twentieth century. Whereas tofu, often uttered in the same breath because it\u2019s also a soy-based protein source, starts with soy milk, tempeh begins with whole soybeans that are partially cooked and fermented, during which time they become bound together in a cohesive, web-like mat (if you want to get sciencey, this \u201cmesh\u201d is the mycelium of the fungus Rhizopus).Tempeh can be sliced and deep-fried, pan-fried, roasted, braised, steamed, incorporated into curries, stews, chilis, stir-fries\u2026I\u2019ll stop but the list goes on. (Sometimes there are grains like millet, barley, and brown rice in the mix, too, which is why you\u2019ll see tempeh labeled as three- or five-grain. I like both 100-percent soybean tempeh and grain-bolstered mixes, and I buy the widely available LightLife brand.) The texture is firm, dense, and not at all watery; the flavor is earthy, nutty, and rich (though not overwhelmingly so).I consider these distinct characteristics to be a head start towards deliciousness. Whereas tofu is a soy chameleon\u2014blend it into vegan frosting, churn it into ice cream, or magic it into creamed spinach\u2014tempeh is distinctly...tempeh. (Yeah, don\u2019t try to blend it.) There\u2019s a lot to work with from the get-go, which also means there\u2019s less risk of screwing up.When I am cooking big pieces, be they cubes or triangles for a stir-fry or curry, I often steam or boil them first to ensure ensures that the tempeh is cooked through, with no lingering bitterness. If I\u2019m riffing without a recipe, I\u2019ll pan-fry those pieces in peanut oil (with a generous sprinkle of salt) until they\u2019re deeply bronzed on both sides, then make a quick sauce to go on top, balancing tempeh\u2019s natural earthiness with bright flavors that are spicy and acidic.But most of the time, I\u2019ll skip the blanching and make faster, easier crumbles instead. (I admit that I make tempeh crumbles even more than I make tofu crumbles, my other great love, since there\u2019s no flipping or pressing involved.) They accentuate any dinner I\u2019ve already planned to cook and make the meals I definitely didn\u2019t plan to cook (half a head of cabbage, braised? seven leftover egg whites from an ambitious ice cream project? peanut butter on toast?) a little more legit.Get your own weeknight wingman:Peanutty Noodles with Tempeh CrumblesTempeh skeptics, this recipe will make a convert of you.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titThe Not Depressing VegetarianVegetarianVeganEgg NoodleHealthyishRecipes you want to make.
