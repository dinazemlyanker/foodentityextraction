Which is why, after scheduling my annual flu shot and dousing everything on my desk with hand sanitizer, I headed home to make a double batch of lemon-ginger brew.Forget green juice. Forget echinacea tea. When it comes to restorative liquids, this lemon-ginger brew is the real MVP. It\u2019s a high-octane concoction from food director Carla Lalli Music, who has two kids and knows a thing or two about soothing sore throats.The three-ingredient recipe is minimal, which is good, because no sick person wants to do a lot of chopping and stirring anyway. All you need to do to get things going is toss some peeled ginger knobs (about a half pound) in a food processor and pulse them into a coarse paste. (If you don\u2019t have a food processor, use the larger holes of a box grater or give those knobs a fine chop. It\u2019s a bit more work, but the chopped up ginger will do just fine.)Add the ginger to a medium saucepan with 6 cups of water, bring it to a boil, and then reduce the heat and simmer for 30\u201340 minutes. Use this time for a steamy shower, or even a power nap. (Just don\u2019t forget to set an alarm!) Strain the ginger chunks out with a fine mesh sieve, then squeeze two or three lemons worth of juice into the pot and add agave syrup (or honey, or pure maple syrup) to taste. Just like that, the brew is done.Once made, this brew can hang out in the fridge for up to two weeks\u2014plenty of time to soothe a sore throat while your white blood cells do their healing work. I prefer to heat it up before serving, so the fiery ginger is extra pungent. It\u2019s the kind of burn that makes you really feel like something is working, and I need that. Plus: It\u2019s delicious.This is the time where I should probably acknowledge that, no, this drink isn\u2019t magical. It won\u2019t cure you of whatever ails you, and you should definitely still get a flu shot. Still, there\u2019s something about the holy trinity of honey, ginger, and lemon that soothes your body and your soul. And it pairs excellently with non-sick days too, making rainy mornings and quiet nights at home feel infinitely cozier with minimal effort. So make ginger, lemons, and honey part of your pantry (and fridge) staples, and you\u2019ll never be far from a mug of this cozy and restorative brew. Think of it as insurance against the next time flu season hits .It's time to brew:Lemon-Ginger BrewNo it's not green juice. It's Lemon-Ginger Brew, a creation of food director Carla Lalli Music.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyGingerLemonNever FailRead MorecookingThis Tomato Tart Is So Easy, I Can Tell You How to Make It Over the PhoneBy Emily SchultzRecipes you want to make.
