Do I have cheese?\u2014and then there are Super Bowl nachos. Beautiful, loaded-up, fancy nachos with elaborate toppings, thoughtful construction, nay, architecture, and fresh cilantro sprigs dispersed just so. Just so... you can dive bomb into it with your greedy fingers.When nacho expert Rick Martinez was assigned to develop a recipe that excels in every category (the stakes were high\u2014it\u2019s nachos), he delivered. And yes, he was wearing his signature Lucha Libre apron while doing so.The Chile-Chicken ToppingThe nachos hinge on this chile-chicken recipe that you can steal and use for tacos, burritos, rice bowls, salads, whatever. A maxed-out chile sauce (ancho and chipotle in adobo) that the shredded rotisserie chicken soaks up, transforming into something that Kroger rotisserie oven never saw comin\u2019. Hot, sweet, and smoky chicken that stays juicy thanks to chicken stock, especially since it\u2019s going into the oven next. It takes 30 minutes to make the chile chicken, which you can do ahead, FYI.The chicken, ready for nachos (or whatever!).\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensThe Cheesy Corn ToppingThis is the sneaky best part. A corn salad with salty-crumbly cotija cheese, onion, and a poblano chile (or jalape\u00f1o). It brings a pop of sweet and acts as a sort of unexpected salsa that isn\u2019t wet, and therefore won\u2019t sog up your chips. Since it\u2019s not corn season, you have Rick\u2019s permission to use frozen corn, thawed and drained. Thanks, Rick!Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensThe Construction ManualThis is a two-layer, two-sheet tray operation, as opposed to one tray of 50 layers. It\u2019s easier to eat than the nacho mountain, and you can delay cooking so the second one goes in after the first tray is inhaled, ensuring \u201ca hot, melty batch\u201d right when you want it, which is the most sensual recipe instruction I\u2019ve ever read. Riiiiick! You can assemble about an hour ahead and wrap the trays in Cling Wrap to really make sure you\u2019ve concentrated all of your creative energy into the nachos before you. Now here\u2019s the order you SHALL NOT STRAY FROM:Sturdy tortilla chipsChile chickenCorn salsaShredded sharp cheddarRepeatAfter baking, fresh toppings like radishes, cilantro, pickled jalape\u00f1os, more cotija cheeseThe cheddar (sharp to stand up to the spicy chicken) wilt melt and envelop everything, holding it all together under a cheese roof. It\u2019s also your indicator for when to take the nachos out of the oven, when the cheese is bubbling and beginning to brown.Green pico de gallo!\nLinda XiaoThe Side SalsaKeep the salsa on the side (I repeat: NO SOGGY NACHOS). And sour cream, if you\u2019re my dad and have never missed a sour cream opportunity. We have amazing recipes for smoky cashew salsa, pico de gallo, tomatillo-avocado salsa. Make \u2018em ahead!Then Serve MoveWhen we tasted these in the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen (yeah, somebody\u2019s gotta do it), we served them with tongs because too many people had colds and this was our attempt to not spread germs. It works great, though! So if you\u2019re having a ton of germy people over, use this technique and give everyone their own little party plate of nachos. Aww!Get the recipe:Chile Chicken NachosGuarantee there\u2019s always a hot, melty batch ready for your guests with this nacho construction strategy.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titChickenNachosSuper BowlRecipes you want to make.
