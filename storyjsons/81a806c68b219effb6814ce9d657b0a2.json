(Or even just a sharp knife, if you want to serve them raw.) In the American South, where they are a culinary icon, collard greens are commonly cooked over many hours, mingling with smoked pork or turkey and tinged with vinegar, but there are countless preparations from communities around the world.This collard greens recipe leaves out meat and goes heavy on garlic for flavor. The greens need to cook for at least an hour, but you can leave them unattended for most of that time. The finished dish will present you with plenty of potlikker, the earthy broth the greens and aromatics leave behind from all that simmering. Serve with crusty bread or cornbread for soaking up those flavorful juices, or reserve the liquid to sip on the next day as you would a broth.If you want to get ahead, you can make this recipe a day or two in advance of serving and store it in the refrigerator. Just heat it up on the stove until it\u2019s warmed through. Collards can also be made in an Instant Pot in about 30 minutes or less.Editor\u2019s note: This recipe was originally published October 16, 2017.Ingredients4 servings \u00bdcup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling8garlic cloves, thinly sliced\u00bdteaspoon crushed red pepper flakes2bunches collard greens, ribs and stems removed, leaves torn into 2-inch piecesKosher salt1tablespoon (or more) apple cider vinegarGenerous pinch of sugarPreparationStep 1Heat \u00bd cup oil in a large saucepan over medium.

How many cups would you say equals 2 bunches?DebbieLand O Lakes, Fl1/6/2022I use orange juice instead of water.AnonymousRio Rancho, New Mexico.12/31/2021This was unexpectedly delicious!  The olive oil cooked into mine, so adding more at the end was necessary. And the soup\u00e7on of vinegar, mmm.RosieDayton10/29/2021I've made this several times and loved it. Excellent as written, but also delicious with tweaks for different flavor profiles (e.g., black mustard seeds & cumin seeds for Indian style collards). The garlic cooks in the olive oil pretty quickly, so you need to have all the collards ready to go from the start. AnonymousDC10/19/2019wayyy too much oil. came out very oily at the end, even without drizzling more. i would cut oil in half next time. otherwise everything else tasted great. would also do more than 2 bunches of collards at a time, as they reduce like crazy\u2014there were barely 3 portions in the pot by the end.
