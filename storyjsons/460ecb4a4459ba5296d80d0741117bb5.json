A column from Rachel Karten and Emily Schultz, BA\u2019s social media team, dedicated to all the weird things we see while scrolling, double-tapping, and retweeting.It\u2019s April 2019. Jim Carrey and Benito Mussolini\u2019s granddaughter are feuding on Twitter, Aunt Becky bribed her daughter\u2019s way into college, and Kourtney Kardashian and I have the same taste in wine. What is happening?On Tuesday, Kourtney Kardashian launched Poosh, which sounds to me like the written description for \ud83d\udca8, but is actually her new beauty and wellness website, full of content like Daily Habits to Lead A More Mindful Life (includes walking), Kris Jenner\u2019s FAMOUS BROWNIE RECIPE (walnuts!?), and What KOURT Does Before A BIG NIGHT OUT (spoiler: it\u2019s all about under-eye gel patches, folks). Yeah, none of these are very me. But then Eater alerted me to a hidden gem deep inside the poosh: that Kourtney Kardashian is into natural wine.The article opens with an image of a woman ensconced in a bed of white, fluffy sheets, holding a glass of red wine high over her head. Risky! See, my sheets are black for the sole purpose of hiding the snacks I regularly spill in bed. \u201cOrganic wine is better for your body and the environment,\u201d the article opens, before preceding to explain that the minimal use of sulphites in organic wine can lead to less of a hangover. This first part is true! My issue with the second is that, for one, the headache bit is not proven science. But even more importantly, I often opt for the chilled light reds that are so chuggable and tasty that I drink just enough for a hangover. Whatever, I know what I signed up for.Scrolling further, I come face to face with her suggestions: German winemaker 2naturKinder\u2019s Silvaner, Alessandro Viola\u2019s sparkling Blanc de Blanc, La Moresca\u2019s rosato, just a few of my favorite producers and their bottles all right there. Technically, the article calls them \u201corganic,\u201d which just means the vineyard growing the grapes has been certified, but most of these bottles are actually natural, which means nothing extra is added to the grape juice, regardless of how the fruits themselves are grown. (We get what you mean though, Kourt.) My jaw drops. How could it be? Where did she get these recs? Since when did we have anything in common?All of a sudden, I start imagining me and Kourtney sharing my favorite bottle of sparkling orange wine from Greece. I picture myself introducing Kris to Martha Stoumen\u2019s wines, a female winemaker who makes her wine in California. Then there\u2019s me and Kylie popping a bottle of bubbly Australian Ros\u00e9 p\u00e9t-nat while Travis Scott takes Stormi to the park. I think about Kim, and wonder if she\u2019d be into a Tuscan Chianti\u2014something to remind her of the simpler times of marital bliss. Getting carried away in a sweeping fantasy of spontaneous fermentation, carbonic maceration, and skin-contact (grapes only, get your head out of the gutter), I pause and wonder what it all means.Naturally, I turn to Instagram. Adam Vourvoulis, maker of wine, podcasts and cool t-shirts, thinks its rad: \u201cKourtney is selling natural wines to the audience they\u2019ve built and I couldn\u2019t be more excited that the wines I love are getting this kind of attention. I\u2019m super stoked on this,\u201d he posted. Then I DM Erin Bender, manager of Brooklyn wine shop Irving Bottle to get her take. \u201cI would love to see some 2Naturkinder on Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\u201d she writes back. Marissa A. Ross, Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s wine editor is all for it too. Having more visibility and accessibility is what matters, right? Right! Natural wine is for everyone!So yeah, Kourtney may have meant natural when she said organic, and yes, she is whispers a Kardashian, but if she\u2019s exposing more of the world to the delicious wines that are better for the environment AND for the consumer, then we have no choice but to stan. So let\u2019s cheers to Poosh with one of Kris\u2019 brownies and a chilled glass of Beaujolais.Explore Bon App\u00e9titnatural wineFood on the InternetRecipes you want to make.
