And it\u2019s most fun to make during the summertime, when we get to mix up the exact combo of vegetables almost daily based on what local produce looks best. Quickly blanched pieces of asparagus, haricots verts, cauliflower florets, and even fresh shelling or fava beans can easily take the place of the broccolini. Raw snow or sugar snap peas, shaved summer squash, fresh corn kernels, and even thinly sliced baby beets are all fair game. (Just be careful with veggies that tend to expel a lot of liquid like tomatoes or cucumbers\u2014they\u2019ll taste great in the mix, but the salad won\u2019t be able to sit out and marinate for as long without getting watery.) The one constant here is the punchy, funky blender dressing. With good kimchi at its base, the vinaigrette has enough complexity that all it needs is a little neutral oil to give it body and a splash of vinegar to sharpen it up. \u2014Lauren Schaefer, Kitty\u2019s Market, Hudson, NYThis recipe is part of Short Is Sweet, our collection of summer dishes that deliver a whole lot of deliciousness in 30 minutes or less.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I wish I had thought of this.  Genius.Brushjlsolon, oh7/19/2021\nDid I see strawberries in the photo of the salad or was that in a dream. Ingredients list seems to be missing some items.\nNancy DeckerPhoenix Arizona6/23/2021I hate it when water is not among the ingredients, then instructions say \"add a ton of water\". Water is as important as the other ingredients.Linda6/18/2021Not sure I understand the comments in the reviews below this but after reading the recipe I can attest that there is celery stalks mentioned in the recipe itself.  As far as the vegetables mentioned to substitute for broccoli florets namely the corn, I think it should be up to the individual whether or not to \"blanche\" the corn or other vegetables mentioned that you may use in this recipe.  I haven't made this yet but after thoroughly reading the whole recipe and introduction I certainly will!  Thanks!Anonymous6/18/2021It\u2019s confusing to me that the photo shows celery yet there is no celery in the printed recipe. This sort of poor organization does not inspire too much confidence in the rest of the support. AnonymousBaltimore6/18/2021someone seriously edit this webpage or hire me to do it. jfcAnonymousHamilton, ON6/4/2021y'all got an editor?\n\nIs the corn and squash staying raw???? There's none visible in the image (that also has carrots and celery?!?!?!!?!? hello?!)\nAnonymous6/4/2021I'm confused. There's clearly sliced celery in the photo, but none in the recipe? I don't mind either way but its throwing meAnonymous5/27/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladCarrotVegetableCeleryRadishAsparagusCauliflowerGreen BeanSummer SquashSquashSummerQuickEasySideDairy-FreeGluten-FreeDinnerRecipes you want to make.
