Mesmerizing swirls of black and white sesame\u2014a galaxy of buttery tahini pound cake. But something that beautiful seemed unattainable, and my dream of making it sunk like the Heart of the Ocean at the end of Titanic.Then senior food editor Claire Saffitz gave me a pep talk\u2014like she has before with buttermilk biscuits\u2014and I realized it\u2019s not all that difficult. So, how do you make marble cake? How do you achieve food stylist perfect swirls? It takes some trust in the process, decisive swirling, and not overdoing it. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to mastering that made-for-the-\u2019gram swirl, plus tips for marbling other treats.This is easier than it looks.\nPhoto by Stephen Kent Johnson, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen Kaminski1. Separate the BattersThere are two colors of batter for this pound cake: a beige tahini and a grey-blue black sesame. It\u2019s important to keep them both in separate bowls and use two separate spatulas to scoop them into the pan. If the colors mix before they hit the pan it will be murky and brown.2. Dollop Alternating ColorsAlternate spoonfuls of tahini and black sesame batter width-wise across the pan, so it looks like thick stripes of each color. It\u2019s okay if they overlap a bit, but they shouldn\u2019t be directly on top of each other. It\u2019s gonna go where it wants to go, so let it do its thing, Saffitz encourages.3. Swiiiiiirl, Baby, SwirlA metal or wooden skewer is the best tool to swirl all the way through, since this swirl is inside the cake rather than only on the surface. Once you cut into a slice, there should be a nice marbling of the two colors. To achieve this, insert the skewer into the batter until it almost touches the bottom of the pan and drag it through in figure-8 patterns. Be decisive when you drag, and do three or four strokes total. If you over-swirl, it will all become one ugly brown\u2014you want definition of color. It doesn\u2019t respond well to fussing, so go for it and don\u2019t be too deliberate with making a \u201cpattern.\u201d You can do the figure-8s in different sizes as long as you don\u2019t do more than four.Less is more\u2014you only need 3\u20134 swirls.\nJoe Wilson4. THE BIG REVEALBake for 55\u201365 minutes until a cake tester\u2014or, hey, maybe that skewer you used before once it\u2019s washed!\u2014comes out clean. Cool in pan for 10 minutes, then run a knife around the shorter sides of the pan and lift the parchment to unmold the cake onto the rack. Then you still have to wait until it cooks completely to cut into it and show off your swirling skills. If you slice it while it\u2019s hot, it could fall apart and ruin all your hard work.Use that swirling technique on tahini brownies!\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Styling by Sue Li5. Swirl Some MoreThe general rule for swirling is that the two things have to be the same texture or consistency. It\u2019s hard to swirl a liquidy thing into a drier thing and vice versa. Try marbling a coffee cake, tahini brownies, or different colors of meringue. And then stand on a chair and take the perfect photo of your creations. \ud83d\ude43Get the recipe:Swirled Sesame Tea CakeThe intense, savory sesame flavor balances out the sweetness of the loaf for an addicting snack or dessert.
