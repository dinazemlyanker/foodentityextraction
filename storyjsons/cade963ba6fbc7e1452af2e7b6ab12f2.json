They\u2019re light, and they look really nice with crunchy sev and different chutneys on top,\u201d says chef Preeti Mistry of this chickpea-and-potato-filled chaat. They call for black chickpeas in this recipe\u2014Mistry recommends Rancho Gordo\u2019s desi chana\u2014which lend a nuttier flavor than the larger, tan garbanzo beans. Pigeon peas or black-eyed peas work well as a substitute. Kala namak, or black salt, which Mistry describes as having a sulphuric smell and an umami kick, should be used in place of kosher salt if you have it.To serve, Mistry suggests encouraging folks to have fun scooping the chickpeas and potato hunks into the puris, then drizzling spiced yogurt, chutneys (like this one), and garnishes over them.Find more of chef Preeti Mistry\u2019s Holi party recipes here.Ingredients8 Servings\u00bdcup dried black chickpeas, soaked overnight, drained (Rancho Gordo desi chana, recommended)Kosher salt3medium Yukon Gold potatoes (about 1 lb.), peeled, cut into 1\" pieces1tsp. ground turmeric\u00bdcup tamarind concentrate (such as \tSwad)2Tbsp. date syrup2tsp. finely chopped, peeled ginger4Tbsp. chaat masala, divided, plus more for serving3tsp. ground cumin, divided3tsp. red chili powder, divided2cups plain whole-milk yogurtVegetable oil (for frying; about 8 cups)17-oz. packet pani puri\u00bdcup Scallion Chutney1small red onion, finely chopped1cup coarsely chopped cilantro1cup coarsely chopped mint18-oz. package thin sevspecial equipmentA deep-fry thermometerPreparationStep 1Place chickpeas in a medium saucepan and pour in water to cover by 2\"; season with salt.
