But I have a secret weapon.By Taria CamerinoOctober 1, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by George WylesolFacebookTwitterEmailI have always had the unholy ability to work unrelenting hours. I could open and close restaurants, pull 30-hour shifts with a broken leg, turn chaotic kitchens into well-oiled machines. I could do it because I love food, and more than that, I love the people who make food their profession, who give so much of themselves to create and share meals with perfect strangers. I love the guests, the farmers, the spice merchants, even the critics. This kind of deep-seated dedication can sometimes make a person feel she has supernatural powers. Like she\u2019s unstoppable even. Until one day she isn\u2019t.My cooking career began at age 17. I worked in caf\u00e9s, apprenticed under a French pastry chef in Florida, studied in France, ran the opening corporate pastry program for all of Ford Fry\u2019s restaurants in Atlanta, helped design the menu for the Tate Modern\u2019s restaurant in London. I became obsessed with chocolate and opened an underground confection shop called Sugar-Coated Radical, then closed it down after a robbery and shifted my focus to savory. By August 2017 I was working as culinary director for Atlanta\u2019s Ladybird Grove & Mess Hall\u2014developing menus, hiring staff, creating a training manual\u2014when suddenly the executive chef left and I was asked to take the role. Okay, I said. I can do this. Then came more executive chef roles for the joint opening of two new concepts from the same owner: Muchacho and Golden Eagle. Okay, I said again. I\u2019m strong. I can handle this too. I can handle anything.Taria Camerino at the farmers' market.\nPhoto by Allie Royce SobleI\u2019d ignored the pain under my arm for months, pushed through, kept quiet. I had a kitchen to run, two more to open, sons to raise, no time. But then one night, alone, drained of energy after a long day of work, I checked. Just check, Taria. That\u2019s when I realized, it\u2019s not my arm. It\u2019s my breast.When I discovered the lump, everything became transparent, even my own body. I knew something was wrong, but I didn\u2019t know how to understand it. So, I went back to work. I opened the restaurants. I ignored the pain for another month. Until finally I couldn\u2019t. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you,\u201d I told my sous-chef as we pushed through dinner rush, 15 hours into my workday, \u201cbut if I don\u2019t go home right now, I just might die.\u201d It took another month to get an appointment with the doctor.Mammogram. Ultrasound. Diagnosis. Breast cancer, Stage 1.It\u2019s a funny thing, being reminded of one\u2019s own fragility. Especially in a restaurant kitchen, which is a hard place to be vulnerable. But I\u2019ve always led with my vulnerability; that\u2019s how I make food that\u2019s poignant. And the good news was, we caught it early. So no surgery, no chemotherapy; just pills every day. \u201cWhatever it takes, you gotta do this,\u201d my staff told me.Memory loss. Vertigo. Nausea. Seizures. A ministroke.I was exhausted beyond comprehension. I had to leave my job. There was no position I could hold, and I\u2019d lost my motivation to cook, even for my family. I couldn\u2019t drive myself to the market or stand for longer than 30 minutes. Worst of all, I\u2019d lost my sense of taste: produce picked that morning, fresh-baked bread\u2014the taste had changed, weakened. What was the point of getting out of bed? I pulled inward, disappeared from everyone, unable to bear the thought of people seeing me so broken.I\u2019ll never work in restaurants again\u2014my body won\u2019t allow it. But now when people say how sorry they are that I got sick, I just smile.Back when I was a 20-something pastry chef, working with chocolate every day was the norm. But it wasn\u2019t until I went into chocolate-making full time that I discovered the power of sourcing. I remember the day it happened: A woman showed up at the door of my shop with a bag of cacao she\u2019d grown on her ten-acre farm in Ecuador. \u201cCould you use this?\u201d she asked. It was raw and rough, not viable by American standards. But I opened the bag, just to smell it, to take a little taste.I got light-headed. This was like nothing I had ever experienced: hibiscus, goat\u2019s milk, sunset, fresh rain. I tasted life. \u201cIt\u2019s funny you say that,\u201d she replied. \u201cAt the farm, we sit under the hibiscus flowers and watch the sunset every evening.\u201dI spent the next 15 years traveling the world, working with any chocolate I could get my hands on. Cacao orchards in Vietnam, micro-farms in El Salvador. Sleeping on sidewalks and floors, spending all I had in the pursuit of more knowledge and more chocolate. In Japan I studied wagashi, traditional sweets made from plant-based ingredients and served with tea, with one of the world\u2019s few female wagashi masters. I used cacao in my creations, despite my teacher\u2019s insisting it was not traditional. Boiled adzuki beans sweetened with sugar, mochi, rice flour\u2014those were the norm. Not cacao.Eventually I managed to change her mind with the care I took in sourcing, the spiritual nature of my approach. She asked me to teach her how to work with chocolate, and we spent hours each day touching, tasting, grinding. The aroma filled the kitchen, permeated our living quarters. We went to bed with the scent of cacao, and we woke to it.When I returned home in 2013, I was changed. More human, more whole. Developing a relationship to people by way of their cuisine is the most profound way to know them.Fast-forward to 2018, five months after the diagnosis. I\u2019d opted to try an intensive dose of CBD, 1,000 milligrams a day, along with the pills the doctor prescribed. It was working, or starting to, enough that I could dabble in the kitchen again\u2014baking simple things like cookies and brownies. Then one morning I woke up with a realization. I needed to make chocolate again. I needed to smell it, to taste it, to be in a room surrounded by it.Luckily I happen to have one of these rooms in my house. Eight feet by 12, piled with chocolate from all over the world. The room had sat unused for months as I lay in bed. But that morning I returned, started to explore again. What if I mixed the chocolate with the CBD? Worth a try. I was already making CBD tinctures and extractions, combining them with adaptogens like ashwagandha and valerian: herbs and roots with medicinal properties that Chinese and Ayurvedic healers have used for centuries. Why not combine them with chocolate?I started by grinding the cacao into a paste for ganache. Raw agave for sweetness. Cocoa butter for creaminess. The going was slow, just a few hours a day rather than my usual 16, but the process was the same: crack, grind, temper, mold. It took four tries to get it right, but when I did, a revelation: a bittersweet dance between cacao and agave, like a kiss from Ixcacao, the goddess herself. A spread-on-toast kind of medicine.It\u2019s the process\u2014it\u2019s using my hands again\u2014that\u2019s bringing me back to life. I can see crystals forming and moving and shifting as I temper the chocolate, raising and lowering its temperature. These crystals become my body. I am healing. I am feeling like myself again, which tends to make me feel invincible. You know, like I can do anything. Even beat cancer.Today my cancer is in remission. And my little chocolate-meets-CBD experiment went pretty well. People were interested; they asked for samples\u2014ganache and tinctures and mints\u2014then came back offering money for more.Logo. Website. Packaging. Production.Five weeks later I had a company. When you\u2019ve spent your life running restaurants, you know how to work systems. The night of the launch, I left exhausted but feeling like I\u2019d found a reason to be alive, to stay alive. I named the company Alchimique because this process is a manipulation of the elements: of many things becoming another thing. A thing that never existed before. A thing that\u2019s strong enough to heal even me.This illness has taken permanent shape in my body: weight gain, distortion, pain. I no longer move in the same way, speak in the same way. I\u2019ll never work in large-scale restaurants again\u2014my body won\u2019t allow it. But now when people say how sorry they are that I got sick, I just smile. I tell them how, strange as it may seem, this sickness has brought me home, to my most precious place. I get to make chocolate every day, and it is magic.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishCannabisChocolateAtlantaChefsessayRead MoreLifestyleWe Taste-Tested Five CBD Chocolates and It Was Extremely RelaxingGallery5 SlidesBy Maggie LangeRecipes you want to make.
