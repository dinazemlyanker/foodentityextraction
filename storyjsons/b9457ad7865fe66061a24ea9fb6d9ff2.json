It's addictive\u2014just try to stop yourself from ordering another curry.ORDER THE: brothy whole fish, stir-fried squid, mushroom curry, and legendary khao soi, the iconic noodle soup that initially put chef Sirichai Sreparplarn on the map. You will probably be told you ordered too much food or that it will be very spicy\u2014don\u2019t give in; this is what you came for. Plus, you can wash it all down with the quirky list of wines and craft beers.THE VIBE IS: kind of wacky. Tables are crammed into every inch of the space, menus are printed on orange construction paper, and the staff will often dress up on the weekends\u2014we loved Elvis night. You\u2019ll find mostly locals who live in the area, sweating it out inside or ordering take-out.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day: Monday to Friday, 5 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday, noon to 3:30 p.m. and 5 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.WE ALSO LOVEMomofuku KoHang out with chefs at David Chang\u2019s continually groundbreaking spot in the East VillageUncle BoonsBrave the spice at NoLiTa's best dinner-with-friends jointTanoreenThe bucket-list-worthy Middle Eastern destination in Bay RidgeExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
