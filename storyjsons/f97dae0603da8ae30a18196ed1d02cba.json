Welcome to Freedman\u2019s, one of our 2018 Hot 10 winners.ORDER THE: tender brisket carved tableside with a battery-operated Waring knife, the genius half-sour salad, extra-crispy latkes straight out of the waffle iron, airy matzo ball soup, and corned beef-stuffed Reubens.THE VIBE IS: like a cooler version of your great uncle\u2019s den. There\u2019s tons of dark wood, like the handsome bar that used to be a fireplace mantle; and wallpaper galore, from modern Escher-like prints to 1940s deadstock florals. It makes you want to order another martini, sink a little deeper into the caramel-hued banquettes, and hang out all night.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Tuesday to Thursday, 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.; Friday, 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 11 p.m.; Saturday, 10:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 11 p.m.; and Sunday, 10:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. Closed Mondays.WE ALSO LOVELanger'sL.A.\u2019s unbeatable pastrami sandwich (sorry Katz's)BotanicaSpend the whole day in Silver Lake at this breezy, vegetable-laden all-day spotSqirlIt\u2019s not a restaurant, it\u2019s a Silver Lake community with a major cult followingExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
