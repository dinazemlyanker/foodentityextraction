Tell me: What's not to love?By Sarah JampelJuly 31, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Caleb AdamsFacebookTwitterEmailYou know that Henry David Thoreau quote turned dorm room wall art, \u201cGo confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined\u201d? (What am I saying: Of course you know it.)I am pleased to announce, dear reader, that I have found the recipe that\u2019s enabled me to go confidently (and sanely) in the direction of the dinner party I\u2019ve imagined. And it's this Summer Salmon Ni\u00e7oise, our summery, not-so-traditional spin on the classic composed French salad. Impressive-looking, healthy-feeling, and fancy-sounding\u2014what's not love?See, I\u2019ve tried to apply Thoreau\u2019s same philosophy to dinner parties for years now, but without much success. I\u2019d invite friends to come after work on a Friday (eight people for dinner on a weeknight? No problemo!), get groceries on my way home, and start cooking three recipes I\u2019d never tried before at 7:30. By the time the food was ready at 9:30, I\u2019d be exhausted. By the time the dishes were cleaned up and I\u2019d body-slammed my friends out the door, I\u2019d have melted into a puddle on the floor, like something straight out of a cartoon. It was never the elegant, effortless, laid-back, low-key dinner party I\u2019d imagined. Don\u2019t lie to me, Thoreau!But it all changed with this salmon Ni\u00e7oise. I got home with the ingredients by 6:30 pm and just one hour later, the four of us were seated around the table, waving our utensils like orchestra conductors, and having a \u201csophisticated\u201d conversation about lord knows what. I even remembered to chill the wine and put on some easy-listenin\u2019 (hey, who says I don\u2019t know how to throw a party?).The magic is in the recipe: While the fish cooks (low-and-slow in a 300\u00b0F oven), you\u2019re free to prep the rest of the ingredients. Separate the butter lettuce leaves (anyone who once enjoyed the game of \u201cHe loves me, he loves me not\u201d will enjoy this petal-plucking exercise); slice the tomatoes (a serrated knife will help); pit the olives; trim and blanch the green beans; and boil the eggs. (Bonus: Since the eggs and beans are boiled in the same pot, you\u2019ll save time waiting for water to boil and washing dishes.) By the time you\u2019ve whisked together the dressing, the salmon is finished (stick a fork in the thickest part\u2014if it flakes without resistance, it\u2019s ready) and you\u2019re ready to assemble. You won\u2019t know how it happened so quickly: Was it all a dream?Eggs cooked for 8 minutes exactly will have those perfect, cooked-but-not-dry yolks. Swoon.\nTed CavanaughI was so calm (so unlike myself!) that I had time to artfully arrange the flaked fish in a conga line down the salad, nestling the olives, eggs, and all of the snappy vegetables into the lettuce cups before spooning mustardy shallot dressing over the whole shebang. My friends looked on in confusion: \u201cYou know we\u2019re just going to mess that up, right?\u201d They had a point, but would that really do justice to such a dignified salad?Even once we ruffled my masterpiece, it was exactly the dinner party I\u2019d imagined. One friend (or should I say \u201cdinner party guest\u201d?) said, and I quote, \u201cThis is perfect!\u201d He was referring to the salad, which we finished with not one leaf left behind, but I\u2019ll extrapolate that to the night as a whole. Because you know what Thoreau also said? \"Friends...they cherish one another's hopes. They are kind to one another's dreams.\"(But, P.S.: If you\u2019re not in the business of having random dinner parties on a weeknight, but you are one of those responsible capital-A adults in the business of meal prep, you\u2019re in luck. You can cook the fish, make the dressing, boil the eggs, and prep the veg a day ahead of time. When you\u2019re ready to eat, just lay out those lettuce leaves all decorative like, dollop them with the vinaigrette, and place your toppings. Even if no one is around to sing your praises, you can revel in your own preparedness\u2014a joy that needs no inspirational quote backup.)Get the recipe:Summer Salmon Ni\u00e7oiseWe love a classic Ni\u00e7oise salad made with fancy oil-packed tuna, but using warm, slow-roasted salmon instead makes the whole thing feel a little more special.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titSalmonSaladBasicallySummerRecipes you want to make.
