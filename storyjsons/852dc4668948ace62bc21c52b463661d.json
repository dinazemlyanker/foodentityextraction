Yes, this one restaurant out of the thousands of restaurants in New York City. You\u2019ll understand soon enough.The Vietnamese restaurant, sister to An Choi in the Lower East Side, has tropical vibes, cubes (yes, cubes!) of charred rice noodles, and our full attention. Maybe it\u2019s the leafy green wallpaper by the bar, the chilled Beaujolais beaded with slightly less sweat than your forehead, all the light that pours in from the skylights above the dining room, or the delicate beef pho speckled with scallions and a single golden yolk (MY PERSONAL FAVE). I could go on, but you get it. It\u2019s got energy, atmosphere, and fantastic food. It\u2019s only about a month old, but we\u2019re already really into Di An Di. Basically editor Amiel Stanek was the first to go, and picking up the breadcrumb trail of Instagram, we all soon followed. Here are our go-to orders of the moment should you stop by our new home:Outside Di An Di in Greenpoint\nChelsie CraigBanh Trang Tron / Rice Paper Salad: \u201cLITERALLY WTF IS THIS THING? Chewy shards of rice paper, chewier bits of jerky, a tangy-spicy-funky sauce, it\u2019s a dream. Breathtakingly fun to eat.\u201d \u2014Amiel Stanek, Basically editorPho Ga Kho / Dry Bo Bo Chicken Noodles: \u201cWhile I didn\u2019t have any of the soups, the dry-style, broth-on-the-side chicken pho\u2014wide rice noodles bathed in a ruddy-colored jasmine-chile sauce and tossed with herbs and bits of tender chicken\u2014was irresistible. That was the thing that I overate until I was nearly sick. Wildly aromatic with just the right amount of heat, it was a really eye-opening dish for me.\u201d \u2014A.S.Bonus: \u201cTHE CONDIMENT CADDY. Four incredible house-made condiments\u2014Sriracha, hoisin, pickled garlic, and some kind of chile sauce\u2014make everything better. As a person who is perpetually feeling sauce-slighted, I was in heaven.\u201d \u2014A.S.Inside the restaurant\nChelsie CraigPho Thin Ha Noi / Beef Pho Hanoi: \u201cIt was amazing. Enough scallions scattered across the top that you could hardly see the broth. An egg yolk ready to be dragged through the soup. The right amount of brisket so that you you feel like you got your money\u2019s worth. And thick-ish rice noodles that defied soggy-pho-noodle syndrome. I will forever crave this soup.\u201d \u2014Rachel Karten, senior social media managerSummer rolls, filled with pork and with a pork dipping sauce\nChelsie CraigBanh Xeo Cuon / Turmeric Crepe Wrapped in Rice Paper: \u201cTurmeric crepe, grilled pork sausage (!), herb salad, all wrapped up in rice paper. Which on its own was herbfreshing, a term I have now coined. BUT THE DIPPING SAUCE. Wow. It was a savory ground pork and sweet rice situation. And, um, you\u2019re dipping pork in more pork. That\u2019s innovation if I\u2019ve ever seen it.\u201d \u2014R.K.A kaffir lime leaf-laced cocktail\nChelsie CraigPho Ap Chao Chay / Crispy Rice Noodle: \u201cThe lotus root was perfectly cooked and crispy as all hell, while the little noodles are just chewy enough. The sauce they\u2019re tossed in has a deep umami flavor you don\u2019t expect to find in a vegan dish.\u201d \u2014Alex Delany, associate editorCrispy lotus root FTW\nChelsie CraigCa Tim Nurong / Grilled Eggplant: \u201cEggplant can be so meh, but this is the opposite. Halved and lacquered with a sweet and salty glaze, you\u2019re staring at a plate covered with an glistening, perfectly-tender eggplant. Not fussy. Not elaborate. On point. This is the dish I was still thinking about walking out the door.\u201d \u2014A.D.Cha Ca La Vong / Sizzling Turmeric Basa Fish: \u201cThis came out on a sizzling cast iron platter\u2014so sizzling that hot oil popped onto my shirt, which was a bit much (was sitting at the bar, intimate splatter zone)\u2014but once the sizzling relaxed, you make bowls of rice, basil, tender dill-y fish, and top it with their homemade fish sauce, which is divine, and crushed peanuts. I second Amiel\u2019s rec for the rice paper salad, too.\u201d \u2014Alex Beggs, senior editorThe scene at Di An Di\nChelsie CraigPho Thin Ha Noi, Chay / Pho Thin Ha Noi: \u201cThis vegetarian pho, with smoky shiitake and oyster mushrooms, scallions, and a poached egg, was so flavorful. I took the leftovers home and ended up eating the rest of it over the kitchen sink a couple hours later.\u201d \u2014Zo\u00eb Sessums, e-commerce editorial assistantBun Bo / Spicy Lemongrass Beef Noodle Soup: \u201cI\u2019m one of those people who slosh so much Sriracha and hoisin into my pho that it turns the broth the color of a murky latte. So naturally I welcomed the sate sauce that came on the side of this fragrant, meaty soup. The condiment is like a chunkier, fishier, spicier XO sauce\u2014as in pretty addictive. You bet I was swirling it into my pho later on.\u201d \u2014Elyse Inamine, digital restaurant editorMake a Vietnamese shakerato to cap off your nightExplore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurants + TravelNew York CityVietnameseRead MorerestaurantsThe Well-Crafted Kitchen: Inside the Whimsical, Dreamy World of FrenchetteBy Elyse InaminecultureI Went to BrunchCon, a Convention for People Who Love BrunchBy Kelly ConaboyrestaurantsWhy Be a Chef When You Can Be an \u201cInternational Pizza Consultant\u201d?By Elyse InamineRecipes you want to make.
