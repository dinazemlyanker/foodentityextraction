I am excited to be here, and I look forward to learning from and working with the team as we build a new future together.When I took my first job in food media in 2012, people in and outside of my company thought I couldn\u2019t do my reporting and editing gigs because I didn\u2019t eat meat. It is incredible to look back at the last decade and realize how far we\u2019ve come as an industry and how significantly the way we talk about food culture has evolved.Across food media, people have fought hard to have these conversations in a meaningful way. We have battled a historically singular lens on food culture. We have had endless conversations around word choice, photo selection, and representation. We have asked ourselves and our peers who we are telling stories for, and if those stories are reflective of the way all Americans cook and eat. Making impactful change can feel slow and frustrating, and I know there is still a lot of work to do. But I also know things are changing.Photo by Laura MurrayFrom 2017 to 2019, Bon App\u00e9tit advisor Marcus Samuelsson and I worked on a television show together, Eater and PBS\u2019s No Passport Required, hosted by Marcus. I bring up the show a lot because its very premise\u2014that immigrant food is American food\u2014is proof, one data point among many, that people are starting to talk about food more globally and more thoughtfully.What really excites me about Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious is the immense potential to have those conversations about food culture with depth and with nuance. The work the team has already been doing speaks to this: Yes, immigrant food is American food. The next generation of Indigenous food is American food as well. Black barbecue is too. So are red sauce Italian joints and taco spots across the nation.Today is my first day, so I know I still have a lot to learn. But I am committed to inclusion and equality in the content we create and among the staff that creates it. I am here to build a team that is empathetic, respectful, and open to being challenged; that is paid fairly for their contributions; that represents the audience we hope to serve. I am looking forward to getting involved with diversity and inclusion efforts across the company and to leading collaborative working groups inside BA.I am committed to doing the work. And I can\u2019t wait to see how we grow together.Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
