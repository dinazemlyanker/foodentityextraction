When meatballs are good, they\u2019re the shining example of what ground meat products can be\u2014crispy and juicy and just the right size to tackle in a couple bites. But when they\u2019re dry, well...we don\u2019t really want to talk about that. It seems disrespectful to the good ones.What we do want is to make sure you never end up making bad meatballs. We want your meatballs to be at the top of their game until the end of time. So we\u2019ve rounded up a little cheat sheet of meatball tips for you to pull out at your convenience. You don\u2019t even need to say thanks. We do this in the general interest of global meatball excellence. We do it because we care. Here\u2019s what you need to know:80/20 Is the Golden RatioWe\u2019re not talking about some kind of business deal here. We\u2019re talking about the fat content of your meat. If you want to walk away with 100% profit, you should use ground meat that\u2019s at least 20% fat. A higher fat content ensures that your meatballs stay juicy. If you\u2019ve ever had a sad, dry meatball, a lean fat content is most likely one of the reasons why.Don\u2019t Over-Mix the MeatAnother meatball-related pitfall? Over-mixing. The more you mix ground meat with seasonings, the tougher, springier, and more compact the finished product will be\u2014we want loose and tender, not tight and sausage-like. Mixing raw ground meat with your hands is an entirely unique feeling, and whether you enjoy it or despise it, you shouldn\u2019t do it for that long. Once your added ingredients seem to be evenly incorporated, stop!Did We Say Added Ingredients?Yes, we did say added ingredients. A meatball made of just meat would definitely be fine, but adding some kind of texture and variety to your meatball makes the whole eating process much more enjoyable. A bit of toasty-ness and crunch from some chopped roasted nuts or some sweetness and chew from bits of dried fruit are exactly what we like to see. Even better? Throw in both. Also: herbs. Herbs are always welcome to the party.Yeah, you could also go the old-school Italian route.\nA Tester Patty Is Never a Bad IdeaYou can\u2019t eat a scoop of raw meat to see if it\u2019s properly seasoned. We would certainly not advise that. So to make sure you\u2019ve added enough kosher salt to the mix, pinch off a little piece of your meatball mixture, form it into a patty, and crisp it in a hot pan. It will cook quickly, and you\u2019ll be able to give it a taste before you form all those meatballs. If it\u2019s tasting right, send the whole batch in. A little under-seasoned? Add a pinch or two more salt.And Then You Cook ThemBut how? There are different methods for getting those meatballs cooked through, and each is meant for a particular set of circumstances. If you have hours to kill on a Sunday afternoon, browning your meatballs and then braising them in tomato sauce is a noteworthy option. The end result will be ground meat that falls apart easily and absorbs a bunch of flavor from the sauce it\u2019s simmering in.But most of the time, we don\u2019t have three hours. And if it\u2019s a Tuesday night, we definitely don\u2019t. Here, we have two options: Searing meatballs in a skillet or roasting them in the oven. Both methods will give you a brown, crispy exterior, and juicy interior (if you\u2019re using that 80/20 ground meat). But the skillet is better for smaller batches of meatballs with a more aggressive browning, and the oven is great for knocking out a large batch in a short time. It really comes down to how many meatballs you want to make, and how immediate your hunger is.It doesn\u2019t matter how you keep these tips handy. Print out this list.
