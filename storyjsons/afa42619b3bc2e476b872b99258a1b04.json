Unless I'm spending a lot of money to eat at a phenomenal sushi restaurant, I eat it for the rice, which is perfectly seasoned with a mixture of salt, sugar, and rice vinegar. Silver Rice, a casual sushi spot in Brooklyn, gets me: They offer the revelatory option of ordering your sushi rolls in bowl form, similar to poke, which gets me my ideal ratio of rice-to-everything-else.Seasoned rice is like rice in technicolor: Rather that being a vessel for other ingredients and toppings, it has a flavor profile all its own. In fact, once you have a foundation of seasoned, clingy-yet-distinct rice, you can be pretty arbitrary about what goes on top. Suddenly a sliced avocado and a sprinkle of furikake or a couple of hard-boiled eggs feel like a full meal because that rice is just so satisfying. But because nobody is that fired up to look at a photo of a bowl of rice (well, I would be), I made a recipe for an easy glazed salmon to go on top. (But if you just make the rice I will of course understand.)There are a few things to note about the rice. 1) Rinse and drain the rice several times to remove excess starch that might prevent the grains from staying distinct once cooked; 2) Follow these measurements exactly, as the 1 \u00bc cups of water we call for takes into account the water that will still be clinging to the grains of rice after rinsing and draining it; 3) Let the rice rest for 10 minutes before fluffing and seasoning it! This completes the cooking process by allowing the water to redistribute inside the pot which creates more uniformly cooked rice; 4) Every sushi restaurant seasons their rice slightly differently so feel free to tweak the proportions of your seasoned vinegar.The miso caramel-glazed salmon is a simple yet awesome update on teriyaki, made with equal parts maple syrup, miso, tamari, and rice vinegar. It is frankly one of my favorite recipes I've developed all year...or maybe ever. It\u2019s delicious, but it could never compete with that rice.Get the recipe:Sushi Rice with Miso-Caramel Glazed SalmonThe tastiest rice is seasoned sushi rice.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishRiceFishRead MoreLifestyleThis Salsa Verde Is Our Desert-Island SauceBy Emily Fiffer and Heather Sperling Recipes you want to make.
