When something's so easy to make that you don't even need one. Welcome to It's That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.I get second-hand stress when I see someone planning too much for a party. When they excitedly tell me their menu, I\u2019m anticipating all of the places where they might fail. When they show me their game-plan I\u2019m thinking about the time they could shave off by preparing something this way instead of that. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m a glass-half-empty kind of gal, it\u2019s that I\u2019m a realist. Some may say it\u2019s how my astrology chart lines up\u2014my rising and moon signs are in Virgo, a notorious type-A planner\u2014but I just think it\u2019s because I know what won\u2019t work from personal experience.Appetizers are the first dinner party element that cause me to break out in stress-hives. How I see it, if you\u2019re hosting a dinner party, the focus is on dinner. You should have a few light bites for people to graze on as the Geminis mosey in, fashionably late, but they should be simple to throw together and involve no oil-stained cookbooks or recipes from websites like these (sorry!). Enter: marinated artichokes. Bathing already-delicious things\u2014meaty Castelvetrano olives, salty feta, or tender canned artichokes\u2014in oil, vinegar, and spices is smart because you\u2019re taking already good products and making them even better. There is little room to fail and few ingredients required.Here\u2019s how I do it:Take a jar of artichokes\u2013the ones you\u2019ll probably find in the pasta sauce section of the grocery store in a clear jar sitting in oil\u2013and add them to a bowl without the mystery oils they\u2019ve been sitting in. Cover them with fresh olive oil and a few splashes of vinegar\u2014I like Sherry here, but red or white wine will work too\u2014and add a clove or two of crushed garlic. Sprinkle in salt, freshly ground black pepper, and smoked Spanish paprika. If you decide to make these the morning of your party\u2014which is what you should do since you\u2019ll be carving the roast chicken or dressing the salad later in the day\u2014you can leave them covered on your counter until you\u2019re ready to serve. At that point, put the artichokes out in a shallow bowl alongside crusty bread, a pile of beautiful veggies, and that aioli you made the day before. Then call your appetizer spread done.Phew, that was so easy wasn\u2019t it?! And yes, I\u2019m available for dinner party menu consultations\u2014just pay me back in marinated artichokes.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimpleappetizerEntertainingRecipes you want to make.
