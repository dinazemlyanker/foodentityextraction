It doesn\u2019t have to be this way! Senior food editor Andy Baraghani is here to prove it. His glazed and grilled recipe is the way you\u2019ll want to eat squash all summer, because it packs a punch without any advance marinating or fuss. Make it in 20 minutes to pair with chicken thighs or fish, or serve it with crusty bread and olives for laid-back happy hour bites.Summer squash like zucchini can quickly go mushy from their high water content, so Andy uses strategic (and aesthetically-pleasing) scoring to maximize flavor. He cuts each squash half in a  \u00bc\u201d crosshatch pattern, then tosses it with 1 tsp. kosher salt in a colander. The salted squash hangs out over a bowl for 10 minutes\u2014enough time for water to drain, ensuring less sog and more concentrated summer squash flavor. The slices also create space for the marinade sink into the starchy flesh.The marinade, by the way, is a spicy-sweet sambal-soy mixture fortified with honey and rice vinegar. It\u2019s reduced in a saucepan until juuust on the verge of syrupy, creating a glaze that\u2019s glossier than a millennial makeup brand. It gets brushed across the squash regularly while grilling (we recommend using this brush!) until there\u2019s a bit of char and an irresistible, shiny lacquer.You could stop here, but a quick, bright herb salad brings this recipe over the top. Toss a sliced shallot and plenty of tender-stemmed cilantro in lime juice and salt, and you\u2019re set. Transfer the squash to a platter, drizzle with leftover glaze, then make it rain herbs and sesame seeds. One bite yields a kaleidoscope of high-summer flavor\u2014acidic quick-pickled shallot, spicy-sweet squash, a hint of char\u2014that begs to be washed down with a glass of salted watermelon juice. It doesn\u2019t get more summery than that.Get the recipe:Sweet and Spicy Grilled Summer SquashThe crosshatch pattern isn\u2019t just for show (even though it does look cool)!View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSquashSummer SquashGrilled VegetablesGrillRead MorecookingThis Charred Cabbage with Goat Cheese Recipe Is Vegetarian Grilling at Its BestBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
