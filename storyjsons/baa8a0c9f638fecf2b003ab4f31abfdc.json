But they knew they wanted to work on an urban farm\u2014and eventually start one. So they volunteered on farms as part of the Worldwide Opportunities on Organic Farms (WWOOF) network for a few years until they came up with the idea for their own agriculture project: Leil\u00fa Gardens. In Tlingit, they say, \u201cLeil\u00fa\u201d means \u201cbutterfly.\u201dA seed keeper and member of the Tlingit Nation, Kirby-Shoote today tends to 1.5 acres of land in Detroit, the ancestral homelands of the Anishinaabe Nations. The seeds that they grow, such as Cherokee White Eagle corn and scarlet runner beans, make up fertile ground for Indigenous food sovereignty. The U.S. government\u2019s forced relocation of tens of thousands of Indigenous peoples onto barren lands has resulted in a long legacy of little Native access to traditional foods, and Kirby-Shoote is looking to change that.They provide traditional foods and medicine to Detroit\u2019s communities of color through an accessible garden and work with I-Collective, a group of Indigenous chefs, activists, herbalists, and seed keepers dedicated to food sovereignty and providing educational resources for food justice. And their work is not for profit. For them food is medicine, and it shouldn\u2019t be sold or used for monetary gain but to heal\u2014literally, as so many health issues, such as heart disease, arise from food insecurity and lack of access to crops, including Native ones. Kirby-Shoote\u2019s own father died due to health complications.Kirby-Shoote shared about their work in urban agriculture, what set them on their path to food justice, and their vision for a future in which Indigenous practices shine.My life changed forever when\u2026 my father passed away from a preventable disease. I knew it was the quality of food he was given and the food systems that did him in, for better lack of phrasing. I had become aware of the nutritional and spiritual aspects of food at the same time, and I was always trying to convince him to eat healthier. There was a huge financial obstacle, a huge time obstacle. I couldn\u2019t be stagnant after he passed away. That\u2019s when I signed up for WWOOF. I sent out so many emails to farmers. It was the beginning of winter so there was not much work in agriculture, but someone in Detroit hit me up. I landed here and never looked back.This year I was able to grow\u2026 a field of corn as opposed to, like, 12 beds. I grew the Cherokee White Eagle seed for corn. And for beans I grew scarlet runner beans. I think those seeds were brought on the Trail of Tears when the Cherokee endured forced relocation from Georgia to their current Reservation in Oklahoma. When you\u2019re deciding what to carry with you on a journey that might not end with you surviving, the importance of that seed really comes through in terms of taking care of future generations.One thing I\u2019ll never do is... sell or use seed and food for monetary gain. That\u2019s not to say trades are off the table. Trading is beautiful and has, in the past, connected so many nations across Turtle Island (North America). But I don\u2019t sell food and I don\u2019t make any money. I think that\u2019s integral to changing the system.I recently took the big step of\u2026 acquiring permanent farming land for the community. Community ownership is very important and can exist outside of the capitalist system. That land will be eventually put into a trust because I know it doesn\u2019t end with me. The trust will eliminate a huge barrier to access to land.Our Black relatives deserve just as much to know about\u2026 their seed memory. Every culture has seeds their ancestors relied on, relevant to both survival and tradition. That variety and scope that seeds have is really meaningful and I hope to bring everyone into that picture. We\u2019re a mostly Black city. The land I acquired will also be used as a teaching space for the community.One way to start honoring Indigenous people\u2026 is to see who has been on the land that you occupy. Who has their ancestral, current, and future presence there, because a lot of people like to view Indigenous people as relics of the past. It\u2019s easy for people to think, \u201cThese ancient people did X, Y, and Z,\u201d but it\u2019s harder for them to come to terms with modern-day Indigenous people and future Indigenous people. It\u2019s a huge visibility issue and a huge lack of imagination for what the future will look like.My vision for the future\u2026 revolves about abundance for everybody. What if Indigenous knowledge is able to shine? And what happens if restorative practices continue? I think that the future looks like feasting and having abundance. I see abundance projected from the garden everyday. I always think, \u201cWhy isn't it like this for everybody?\u201d Because it could be.Explore Bon App\u00e9titPerson of InterestCultureRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
