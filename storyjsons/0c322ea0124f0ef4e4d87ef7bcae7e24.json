Clean Your Dutch Oven This WeekendI vowed to be better at stain removal in 2020 and I\u2019m sharing two great tips with ya.By Alex BeggsJanuary 18, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Caleb AdamsFacebookTwitterEmailEvery Friday morning, Bon App\u00e9tit senior staff writer Alex Beggs shares weekly highlights from the BA offices, from awesome new recipes to office drama to restaurant recs, with some weird (food!) stuff she saw on the internet thrown in. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Stains and beansI made the New Year\u2019s intention to be better about stain removal in 2020 and to eat more beans. Both of which came to a head last weekend when I made a pot of Basically\u2019s black bean soup in my cute white Milo dutch oven (you should...buy the black one). The soup was great, 10/10 would cook again, even though I made the fatal mistake of using old [BRAND NAME REDACTED] grocery store beans that never fully softened. I blended it to smithereens to cover that up. Then I had a pot tye-dyed purple-black from the beans. Until I remembered a tip from an old bonappetit.com article. You sprinkle baking soda in the pot, fill it with water to whatever level your stain reaches, boil it for 5-10 minutes, and let it sit overnight. The next morning I was able to scrub all of the bean grime out.Unrelated but another life-changing stain tip for me: red wine stain on your tablecloth? Make a 1:1 mixture of dish soap and hydrogen peroxide, pour it on the stain, let it soak in, then launder per usual and learn how to pour properly.Get the recipe: Basically Black Bean SoupGet the knowledge: How to Clean Your Dutch Oven (Without Ruining It)Want this letter before it hits the website?

She goes on to reference her mother\u2019s \u201camazing pastas, lasagnas, and...Thanksgiving\u201d before showing us how to make lasagna. In fingerless gloves (!), she \u201csteams\u201d lasagna noodles in a pot of water, complaining that she prefers the already-cooked noodles, and that she wished the mozzarella was already shredded too. \u201cI\u2019m making this a lot more work than it is,\u201d Paris sighs. It\u2019s almost as if she wishes the lasagna were already cooked, by someone else, in a restaurant maybe? \u201cCooking with Paris\u201d will make you question what it means to be an amazing cook, or at least make you question why there\u2019s an essential oil diffuser on the kitchen island. I admire a show that pushes the boundaries like that.You thought Molly Baz loved salt???Big cream cheese plansPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensThis weekend I\u2019ve got big cream cheese plans. In a Test Kitchen cleanout I scored a few boxes of Philadelphia cream cheese, which scandalously originated in New York, btw. And I could only think of one thing I wanted to do with it. Bake Molly Baz\u2019s Basque burnt cheesecake a second time, remembering the heavy cream this go-around. It\u2019s so jiggly creamy perfect and extremely easy.Read more Philly cream cheese fun facts here.Get the recipe: Basque Burnt CheesecakePhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Susie Theodorou, prop styling by Emily EisenSpeaking of jiggleI loved this essay about panna cotta over at Taste. \u201cI\u2019ve served it to people I was wooing and to kids and to nice people and to jerks,\u201d writes Sadie Stein.

In the food arena of TikTok, there\u2019s a whole genre of people/mostly teens who work at fast food restaurants and reveal secrets like how one beloved place makes mashed potatoes from an add-water mix.

Alex Delany refuses to smash; he prefers to thinly slice or microplane garlic. Upon hearing that Adam Rapoport smashes and puts whole cloves of garlic into pasta sauce, Delany screamed: \u201cThat\u2019s the most ILLOGICAL thing you can do! Someone\u2019s going to get a whole clove of garlic in their sauce! It should be spread throughout the sauce to make every bite more garlicky. That\u2019s a more democratic system.\u201d A quick poll of the office revealed microplaning to be the most common way staffers \u201cdeal with garlic.\u201d But Jampel has no time for microplaning when a recipe needs multiple cloves: \u201cYou can only grate one at a time!\u201d She\u2019s a smasher. \u201cThese are different means to the same end,\u201d said peacemaker Rachel Karten before Delany took the last word: \u201cWe can all agree Adam\u2019s way is the worst way.\u201d Whispers: I do it the Adam way.Get the recipe: Vegetarian Chili with Lots of FritosWait, before you go!
