The sauce was also very thin. AnonymousSt. Louis 3/11/2022Pretty bland to be honestAnonymous2/21/2022Good, but I would halve the butter next time and add way more greens.SkankasaurusPhiladelphia2/1/2022Well balanced, flavorful. I recommend making more broth. I also used a lot more Thai chilis, but I like the heat. Nice recipe, it's now a part of my monthly meal plan, thanks!Ed Y.Dogtown, Mo. USA1/30/2022I didn't use kale either time I followed the recipe, but the lack of extra veg didn't take away from the dish. I liked the lemony freshness throughout every bite. I tried with mushrooms which turned out pretty great. A good base recipe to make your own.KateAshland, WI1/22/2022Would not make this again. I truly don\u2019t understand the previous reviews. This pasta was bland, the butternut squash mushy despite crisping them and spreading them between two different sheets. The only redeeming quality was the crisp on top, but even that didn\u2019t have much flavor. The \u201csauce\u201d is barely any cheese and mostly water, with very little acidity from the lemon juice. In the end, this was just a dressed up version of the butter noodles I ate as a kid. Very disappointing.AshMonroe, WA1/12/2022made it vegan by using earth balance vegan butter & nutritional yeast for the parmesan. made it gluten free by using gf rummo spaghetti & gf panko (which i made more palatable by crushing with a tenderizer). i also increased the garlic & added red pepper flakes. highly recommend- i crave the beautiful lemon notes days after having it.moonbeamsanta cruz, ca1/9/2022Yay, a recipe I can manipulate into a whole food plant-based/vegan indulgence! I used acorn squash and baby spinach for this, and to cut back on fat, I avoided using any oil until starting to wilt my spinach. I also substituted 1/4 cup of Earth Balance for the 1/2 cup of butter, and instead of your typical parmesan, I used Follow Your Heart's dairy-free parmesan. For the pasta, I used Mantova's organic whole wheat spaghetti. This came out absolutely delicioso! And ohmigosh, that crusty pecan/panko, that right there is where the money is at! Oh, and the lemon zest is completely necessary if you want a true explosion of flavor!!! RikaGrove City, PA1/6/2022It\u2019s really good, but it is so much better with red pepper flakes.AnonymousNew Haven, CT12/30/2021Delicious vegitarian dish! Im always looking for good recipes without meat and this one is a winner. Followed recipe as is! SherryJacksonville, FL12/28/202112/27/21 - Delicious! Lots of prep so start early!JaneHolden, MA (Central MA)12/28/2021sooo delicious, surprised my roommate with it and we both ate so much we got sleepy. replaced squash with sweet potato and kale with baby spinach, since that's what i had, but still totally yum. the topping is perfect. flexible, tasty, somewhat involved dinner.laurenChicago, IL11/30/2021I would spend $25 on a serving of this at a restaurant, and would be pleased! This is a special recipe. I used a whole kabocha squash with the skin on - excellent! Used about 2/3 the butter and would do the same again. The lemon zest + pecans are a complementary duo!AnonymousSeattle, WA11/16/2021Delicious. We used a flavored pasta which only added to the final dish. Used about half the butter and it was still plenty rich and flavorful.Anonymous11/14/2021You know it\u2019s good when you\u2019re supposed to be cleaning up but you\u2019re eating the leftovers out of the pot. 10/10\nMegan MChicago11/14/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titWinter SquashKaleLeafy GreensVegetableBreadcrumbsPastaPecanNutRecipes you want to make.
