Keep a package of frozen precooked udon noodles on hand for those nights when you don\u2019t feel like spending more than, say, ten minutes on dinner. These chewy wheat noodles are extra thick with a bouncy, springy quality that dried udon just doesn\u2019t have. All you have to do is reheat them in boiling water before they\u2019re ready to slurp.Ingredients4 servings 1grapefruit, halved1lemon, halved1red chile (such as Fresno), seeds removed, finely chopped12\" piece ginger, peeled, finely grated\u2153cup unseasoned rice vinegar3Tbsp. soy sauce1tsp. sugar2pints cherry tomatoes1garlic clove, finely grated1Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oilA pinch of kosher salt18oz. frozen udon noodles2medium Persian cucumbers, peeled, very thinly sliced on a diagonalCilantro sprigs, crumbled nori, and toasted sesame seeds (for serving)PreparationStep 1Heat broiler.
