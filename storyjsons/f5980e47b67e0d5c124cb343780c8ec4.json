Produce that grows together goes well together. But this time the anchovies are not optional. They\u2019re an integral ingredient here, and it\u2019s worth seeking out quality brands. We love the oil-packed ones from Ortiz, Agostino Recca, and Merro. For a long, lazy lunch menu serve this salad alongside sea bream crudo, handmade malfatti, grilled turbot, and tiramis\u00f9 with cookies.Ingredients8 servings4oz. haricots verts or green beans, trimmedKosher salt2lb. medium tomatoes, some sliced, some cut into wedges1pint Sun Gold and/or cherry tomatoes, halved crosswise16oil-packed anchovy fillets\u00bccup celery leaves or parsley leaves2Tbsp. red wine vinegar2Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oilSmoked or regular flaky sea saltFreshly ground black pepperPreparationStep 1Cook haricots verts in a large pot of boiling salted water until bright green and tender, about 5 minutes.
