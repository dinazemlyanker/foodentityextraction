But it takes a little finesse and a few rules to get everything done right. This salmon with roasted squash recipe nails the sheet pan method by staggering when the ingredients go in the oven. First the vegetables, then the fish and the topping, and all you have to do is make a simple stirred chile-citrus sauce. Here's how it comes together:Start by getting your array of roasted vegetables in the oven. We use delicata squash, which is rich, earthy, and\u2014the best part\u2014doesn\u2019t need to be peeled. If you have trouble finding it, cubes of butternut will get just as tender and creamy.  Roasted red onion has a suppleness and sweetness, and crunchy cauliflower rounds out the pan. Once the vegetables roast for 25 minutes or so, you'll push them off to the side and add a 1 pound boneless salmon filet lightly drizzled with olive oil. Be sure to reduce the oven temperature to 300\u00b0, so the big piece of salmon can gently cook through.Surprisingly, fish works great for sheet pan dinners because it cooks quickly through direct pan contact. When you add your salmon to the baking sheet, also place a small baking sheet of pumpkin seeds on the top rack. While those pepitas toast and the salmon cooks, use the time to make a really bright, punchy miso mojo. This dressing is no more than fresh orange juice, lime juice, rice vinegar, miso, olive oil, and two thinly sliced serrano chiles. The rice vinegar gives the sweet citrus juice an edge, so it really stands up to the rich salmon and earthy roasted vegetables.Now, it\u2019s time to plate (or bowl\u2014whatever feels right). Arrange the roasted vegetables on the bottom, then cover them with large pieces of the salmon. Drizzle the dressing, then scatter the pepitas on top for a little added crunch. If you want to put an herb on this, go for it, but we think the freshness of the chile and bright dressing hits all the notes. It's the ultimate easy weeknight dish, but it tastes bright, vibrant, and really special.Grab your trusty sheet pan:Sheet-Pan Salmon and Squash with Miso MojoSpiking fresh orange and lime juices with a shot of rice vinegar gives the sweet citrus flavor an edge to stand up to rich fish and earthy roasted vegetables.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSalmonRoasted VegetablesMisoSheet-Pan DinnersWeeknightRead MoreLifestyleThe Weeknight Roasted Salmon Recipe I'll Always DoubleBy Christine MuhlkeRecipes you want to make.
