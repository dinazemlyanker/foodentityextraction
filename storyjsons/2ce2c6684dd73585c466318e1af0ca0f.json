Not only are they more dynamic and widespread than ever (jackfruit birria in East L.A.! Duck fat tortillas in Kansas!), they\u2019re a cultural lightning rod for some of today\u2019s most pressing issues. So we called upon some of America\u2019s notable taco fanatics and asked: What, exactly, do tacos mean to you? For some, it\u2019s a matter of simple pleasure. For others, an identity. A form of political expression. This is a collection of those stories, along with our picks for must-try tacos across the country and some really excellent recipes courtesy of our resident taco maestro, Rick Martinez. So let\u2019s, uh, taco \u2019bout tacos, shall we?  \n  \n\n \n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\nTacos in the U.S. are made possible by the migration of people and that special alchemy that happens when cultures coexist. That\u2019s what Mando Rayo found while traveling the country for his TV show, United Tacos of America: the new and the tried-and-true; faithful interpretations from across the border and unique local creations. Here are 10 he can\u2019t stop thinking about.\n\n\n\n\n\nTripas\nTortiller\u00eda y Taquer\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, Lexington, KY\nCrispy boiled and fried beef intestines + local Kentucky corn + a rickety Mexican tortilla machine = a very tasty example of what happens when south and sur collide.\n\n\n\nCarnitas Surtidas\nCarnitas Uruapan, Chicago\nHerb-kissed Michoac\u00e1n-style carnitas are king in Chicago, but none compare to this crispy-on-the-outside, juicy-on-the-inside pork-fried pork, made by the same family for more than 40 years. \n\n\n\nGoat Birria\nGoat Mafia, Compton, CA  \nA Jaliscan staple\u2014meaty red stew laced with chiles\u2014gets the L.A. taco treatment with local goat, dried chiles, chocolate, and California oranges sourced from the chef\u2019s uncle\u2019s backyard.\n\n\n\nPlacero\nHorchata Deli Grocery, Queens\nYes, haters, NYC does have great tacos. But you might have to go to Jackson Heights, a.k.a. Puebla York, to find them. This one\u2019s packed with rice, chile relleno, nopales, and a hard-boiled egg. \n\n\n\nSmoked Barbacoa\nEddie O\u2019s Texas Barbecue, Houston\nTraditional Tejano cooking meets Houston\u2019s high-stakes craft BBQ scene in these crazy-tender pecan-smoked beef cheeks, served on fresh flour tortillas made by the pitmaster\u2019s abuela.\n\n\n\nCochinita Pibil\nCocina Luchadoras, Baltimore\nThis Yucat\u00e1n classic nods to Baltimore\u2019s rapidly growing Mexican population: Citrus-marinated pork cooked under banana leaves is shredded into a house-nixtamalized corn tortilla. \n\n\n\nBaja Fish\nTJ Oyster, San Diego\nJust over the border from Baja, San Diego often feels like an extension of Mexico. So do these corn tortillas topped with hot battered tilapia, cabbage, and a dollop of creamy, creamy crema. \n\n\n\nShrimp al Pastor\nTaqueria El Paraiso, New Orleans\nAfter Katrina, Mexican immigrants came to help rebuild the city, creating in their wake Mexican-Creole crossovers like this taco full of gulf shrimp cooked to pineapple-y pastor perfection.\n\n\n\nDuck Carnitas\nNixta Taqueria, Austin\nIn Austin, tradition and novelty go hand in hand. These blue corn tortillas are nixtamalized Aztec-style, paired with not-so-traditional duck confit carnitas, and topped with spicy green salsa cruda.\n\n\n\nKiss Chicken\nKiss Pollos Estilo Sinaloa, Phoenix\nLeave it to the Sinaloans, one of Phoenix\u2019s largest immigrant groups, to make an excellent chicken taco: charcoal-grilled, doused in cheese, sprinkled with pork, and wrapped in two corn tortillas.\n\n   \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese Vegan Tacos Are More Than a Trend\n\nFor a growing group of Chicana cooks, eating meat-free is about reclaiming their roots.\nby LESLEY T\u00c9LLEZ\nREAD MORE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTacos Are My Resistance\n\n\n\n\nIn the kitchen, I teach my kids how to be Mexican and proud.\nby MANUEL GONZALES\n\nREAD MORE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI Went Looking for My Mexican Identity and Found It at Plaza Fiesta\n\nGrowing up in the South, I struggled to locate my Mexican-ness.

Down south, it\u2019s volc\u00e1n\u2014maybe since they see more volcanoes than bats! Either way, juicy pork al pastor and oozy quesillo are a brilliant combo.\u201d \u2014RICK\u00a0MARTINEZ\nGET THE RECIPE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nBig Taco Moments in the USA\nFrom canned tortillas to crispy\u00a0carnitas, professor Steven\u00a0Alvarez (who teaches a Taco Literacy class at St. John\u2019s University in Queens), traces how the American taco found its way\n\n\n\n\n\n1905\nThough tacos gained popularity as a Mexican street snack in the late 1800s (and wrapping food in tortillas traces back to the Aztecs), this is the year of their first known mention in a U.S. newspaper. Brought across the border by migrant workers, tacos were typically sold out of pushcarts in border cities like San Antonio and L.A.\n\n\n\n1937\nAt Mitla Cafe in San Bernardino, CA, the Rodriguez family\u2019s fried tacos dorados\u2014literally \u201cgolden tacos\u201d\u2014hit the scene. Three decades later a dude named Glen Bell would take notice, infiltrate the kitchen, and use them as the model for the standardized hard-shell tacos at his own restaurant, a little place called Taco Bell. Perhaps you\u2019ve heard of it.\n\n\n\n1955\nTacos get the official American food treatment of the day when a company named Ashley Foods of El Paso (a precursor to Old El Paso) markets the first taco dinner kit nationally. It introduces the concept of tacos as \u201cMexican sandwiches.\u201d Oof. The kit includes Ashley brand canned tortillas (\u2026no comment), beans, taco sauce, and\u2026a tortilla fryer. \n\n\n\n1960\nSecond-generation Lebanese immigrants in Mexico City adapt the shawarma rotisserie technique into the trompo\u2014a vertical slow-cooked pork spit, marinated with pineapple and sliced onto a tortilla\u2014which became what we know today as tacos al pastor. It would take another generation, however, before they became a standard in taquerias across the U.S.\n\n\n\n1974\nMexico City traffic cop turned Los Angeles dishwasher turned entrepreneur Raul Martinez converts an ice cream truck into the world\u2019s first taco truck. He parks it outside a bar in Cypress Park, selling meaty soft-shell tacos topped with his signature homemade salsa. It\u2019s so successful that he opens a brick-and-mortar within six months, which today has expanded into the multimillion-dollar restaurant chain King Taco.\n\n\n\n1983\nRubio\u2019s\u2014a chain specializing in deep-fried breaded fish tacos referred to as Baja style\u2014opens in San Diego. Though popular among surfer bros in Southern California in the 1960s, fish tacos were eaten in Mexican seaside communities across the Pacific and Gulf Coasts long before any of the Beach Boys were even born. \n\n\n\n1989\nFast-food chain Taco John\u2019s trademarks Taco Tuesday\u00ae nationally (except in New Jersey, where Gregory\u2019s Hotel, of all places, holds the trademark and dares to also serve tacos on Thursdays). Both companies have held tight to their trademarks, much to the chagrin of LeBron James, who tried and failed to get his own in 2019.\n\n\n\n1994\nThe Mexican peso crisis\u2014a sudden devaluation of the peso against the dollar\u2014leads to mass migration across the border and beyond to places like Kentucky and New York. Regional tacos such as al pastor, placeros, and birria come too, expanding America\u2019s taco horizons for good.\n\n\n\n2015\nWelcome to the world, taco emoji! After years of griping from taco-hungry typers around the world, an official Taco Bell petition, and multiple rounds of tacoless additions (including four types of mailboxes and 25 clocks), the Unicode Consortium adds to the official emoji keyboard a tiny taco, cementing its status as pop culture icon.

Just the two of us. We\u2019d get tacos de queso fundido con chorizo. These hot three-bite tortillas filled with melted cheese and meat were a taste of home. But more importantly, they were a way to connect my American-born son with his Mexican roots. To remind him that he\u2019s the son of an immigrant.
