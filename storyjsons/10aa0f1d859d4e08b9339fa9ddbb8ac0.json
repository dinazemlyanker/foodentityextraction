We'll catch up with Emily and Heather regularly for stories, recipes, and dispatches from the front lines of Botanica, their women-led, vegetable-first kitchen.It all started with banana bread. After a whole lot of trial and error, we\u2019d perfected a recipe that was gluten- and refined sugar-free, foolproof, and extremely delicious. Then we got cocky. If we could make it this good, surely it could be even better. We craved more texture, a whomp of flavor, a je ne sais quoi to give it an edge over all the other banana breads. The answer was ghee.We\u2019d used ghee when cooking Indian food and respected its place in the Ayurvedic nutritional canon (it\u2019s thought to improve digestion and aid absorption of nutrients, and is considered beneficial to all three doshas). But we never understood its versatility and flavor-amping powers until that fateful day when we ghee-toasted our quick bread. Since then, it has achieved staple status in our kitchens (at Botanica and in our homes).As a source of flavor, ghee is truly transformational: Deep and complex, it\u2019s like butter on steroids. That\u2019s not hyperbole because ghee is literally the essence of butter, the result of heating it gently until the milk solids separate and caramelize (closer to but not quite brown butter) and the water cooks off. After a strain, only the fat remains\u2014and its high smoke point is ideal for achieving crispy surfaces while, in the case of the banana bread, leaving the interior pillowy and soft.Banana bread was our gateway drug; then we turned to long-fermented loaves. That\u2019s how Tahini Toast was born: a thick slice of Bub & Grandma\u2019s 30 percent rye bread seared in homemade ghee and topped with maple-orange tahini, berries, cinnamon-candied pecans, a sprinkle of Maldon, and a shower of maple syrup. It\u2019s like French toast and PB&J had an intensely delicious lovechild\u2014and the ghee is what makes the magic.Beyond toast (and Indian cooking, of course), we use ghee to fry eggs to crispy perfection and soft-scramble them (ghee + eggs = perfection). We melt it in a pan with brown mustard seeds and curry leaves and stir it into salted, lime-y yogurt. And don\u2019t get us started on pancakes, from sweet multigrain to savory socca.Sure, we could use olive or coconut oil in most of these circumstances. We could also abstain from watching Game of Thrones and meditate instead. But we believe in indulgence, especially when it comes to food and fight scenes.Making your own ghee will pay off in spades: It\u2019s shelf-stable so will keep for ages on your countertop, and it requires just one ingredient available at pretty much every grocery store in the continental US. If you\u2019d rather buy a jar, we love Fourth & Heart and Ancient Organics. Once you have your magical golden elixir, we promise you won\u2019t stop using it. Just look what happened to us.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishGheeBotanicaToastRead MoreLifestyleThis Salsa Verde Is Our Desert-Island SauceBy Emily Fiffer and Heather Sperling Recipes you want to make.
