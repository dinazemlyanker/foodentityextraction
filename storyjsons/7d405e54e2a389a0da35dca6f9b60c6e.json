When something\u2019s so easy you don\u2019t need one. In It\u2019s That Simple, we\u2019ll talk you through the dishes and drinks we make with our eyes closed. Today, cheesy croutons.I never thought I would become a strong advocate for keeping a large batch of homemade croutons on hand. A crouton spokesperson, if you will. In fact, I\u2019d never given that much thought to croutons at all. Sure, they may be a nice textural addition to salads and soups (we\u2019re huge fans of Crispy Gone Soggy around here), but they\u2019ve never been top of mind.But the cheesy mustard croutons on Christina Chaey\u2019s Creamy Cauliflower Soup changed my life mind. Those deserve more than a little hype.Instead of showering the cubed bread with dried onion or garlic powder (my default in the past) or taking a cue from the store-bought variety and turning to Italian seasoning, Chaey coats the croutons in Dijon mustard and shredded Gruy\u00e8re or cheddar cheese before baking.Mildly tangy mustard and buttery Gruy\u00e8re are a perfect croque monsieur\u2013esque combination (and a nice change of pace from typical crouton seasonings). When the two team up, they can give any stale or past-its-prime bread you have on hand a new lease on life. That loaf in the freezer you\u2019ve been meaning to turn into breadcrumbs for weeks? Drench it in cheese, butter, and Dijon, crisp it up, and it\u2019s ready to boogie.Here\u2019s how to make cheesy mustard croutons:Combine 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, 1 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted, and 1 Tbsp. Dijon mustard in a medium bowl and whisk to combine; season with salt and pepper. Add 5 cups country-style bread, preferably day-old, torn or sliced into 1\" cubes, and toss to coat in mustard mixture. Scatter \u00bd cup finely shredded Gruy\u00e8re or cheddar cheese over, toss again to combine, then transfer croutons to a prepared baking sheet. Bake croutons at 350\u00b0 until cheese is melted and crisp around the edges and croutons are golden brown and crunchy, 10\u201315 minutes, flipping once halfway through. Then it\u2019s ready to shower over salads and soups galore.Of course you can use these as a topping on most creamy soups or hearty salads that play nicely with bold flavors and rich dressings, but that\u2019s not all: These seasoned, flavor-packed croutons can also get folded into an eggy breakfast casserole in lieu of cubed bread or crumbled over firm whitefish like cod in place of breadcrumbs before baking. Or do what I did: Plow through half your stash by munching on them as a snack in the way you would cheesy crackers or chips.\u00a0That\u2019s it\u2014I have officially made a full transformation into a crouton hype-person.Get your soupCreamy Cauliflower Soup With Cheesy Mustard CroutonsCauliflower shows its soft side in this velvety-smooth and just-rich-enough soup topped with cheesy, mustard-y croutons.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingIt's That SimpleRecipes you want to make.
