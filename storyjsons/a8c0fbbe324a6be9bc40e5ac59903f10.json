These tips on how to store strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries will help you to mitigate the madness of quickly perishing produce once and for all. With just a little extra effort up front, you\u2019ll save money, prevent food waste, and keep your berries fresh long enough to enjoy them out of hand or ready to use in berry desserts and treats all season long.Select the best berries from the bunchWhether you\u2019re purchasing them from your farmers market or local grocery store or picking them yourself, selecting the best berries is key to their longevity. Because berries are fragile fruits that are thin-skinned, one bad berry can turn the whole bunch. Pick out and discard any that are already bruised, slimy, or spoiled. If you\u2019re noticing blackberry stains on the clamshell container, or strawberry juices pooling at the bottom of the carton, it\u2019s a good indicator that there are a couple berries past their prime in the mix. Instead, seek out firm, plump, shiny berries. If you\u2019ve already got some squished berries on hand, don\u2019t waste them: Save them for smoothies, make a breezy berry compote to top pancakes, or soak and mash in rum for a tangy, syrupy ice cream topping.Don\u2019t crowd your berries in storageCrowded berries get smushed easily, leading to speedier spoilage. Let your berries breathe by storing them in a wide, flat container lined with paper towels once you bring them home. Cover with a loose-fitting lid to let excess moisture (a breeding ground for bacteria) escape, or use produce-specific storage containers that promote airflow to help keep those summer blueberries fresher longer. Another pro tip: Avoid storing berries in the coldest corner zones of your fridge where they\u2019re at risk of getting frostbitten. Instead, store them front and center where the temperature is less frigid. (This also helps to keep them top of mind, ensuring you remember to enjoy them sooner, rather than later.)OXO Produce Keeper$14 $13 at AmazonGive your berries a spa treatmentWashing berries before use may seem counterintuitive\u2014we know that moisture and dampness are the enemy when storing produce\u2014but giving them a quick bath in diluted white vinegar (3 cups water to 2 Tbsp. vinegar) as soon as you\u2019re home from the market will kill any existing mold spores that would make them go bad faster. Rinse thoroughly to remove any lingering vinegar taste, then dry the berries gently to avoid bruising. A careful swish through a salad spinner lined with paper towels helps to speedily wick away moisture.Freeze them for laterEven when you know how to store strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries properly in the fridge, you still might find yourself overwhelmed by more fruit than you can possibly use. If you\u2019re blessed with an abundance of peak-season berries that you absolutely know you won\u2019t be able to enjoy before they spoil, stash them in the freezer to enjoy year-round. All the same rules apply: Select only the best berries, toss out the spoiled ones, rinse them in diluted vinegar, and carefully and thoroughly pat dry. (For strawberries, you\u2019ll want to go the extra step and hull them, for ease of use later.) Spread out your berries into a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze until solid. They\u2019re then ready to store in freezer bags for six months to a year\u2014just be careful to remove as much air as possible from the bags after each use to prevent freezer burn. Use your frozen summer bounty in baked goods like muffins or quick breads, smoothies, or homemade jams and preserves.Explore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
