Showcasing the flavors of where I come from serves as a bridge between Jewish cultures.\u201d Admony likes to make the soup itself ahead of time; she then uses a portion of the broth to cook the matzo balls just before serving, which prevents them from getting mushy.Ingredients6 - 8 ServingsHawaij2Tbsp. ground cumin1Tbsp. ground coriander1Tbsp. ground turmeric1\u00bdtsp. freshly ground black pepper1tsp. ground cardamom\u00bdtsp. ground clovessoup8skin-on, bone-in chicken drumsticks (about 2 lb.), patted dryKosher salt2Tbsp. vegetable oil1large onion, cut into \u00bd\" pieces1head of garlic, most of outermost skins removed, roots trimmed\u00bdsmall butternut squash, peeled, cut into 2\" pieces3medium Yukon Gold potatoes (about 1\u00bc lb.), peeled, cut into 2\" pieces2medium carrots, peeled, cut into 2\" pieces2celery stalks, cut into 1\" pieces2dried bay leaves1quart low-sodium chicken broth\u00bdtsp. ground cumin\u00bdtsp. ground turmeric\u00bdcup finely chopped cilantromatzo balls4large eggs\u00bccup vegetable oil2Tbsp. finely chopped cilantro2tsp. dried fenugreek leaves, crushed, or \u00be tsp. ground fenugreek seeds1tsp.

Following the first reviewer comments, I used regular-sodium broth and added the water gradually as needed as liquid boiled off. Agree that if you want the veggies firmer you should add them later than is called for, but I didn't and still thought they were delicious.Luc3/31/2021Overall, a good soup and a fun alternative to our regular matzo ball soup. I did think that the broth itself needed to be salted, I\u2019m not sure why that is not included in the recipe. I also felt the vegetables did not need to cook the full hour. The potatoes and squash were definitely verging on overcooked. If we made it again, we would add the vegetables later. I tried to give 4 stars but for some reason the review got stuck at 5 and I can\u2019t change it.
