So when Healthyish rolled out their Healthyish Homecoming, a day-long festival full of food, drinks, and seminars \u00e0 la #FeelGoodFriday, it was only fitting that Vitamix sponsor the panel \u201cEntrepreneurs Run the World.\u201d Not only did the brand have its own humble beginnings back in the 1930s, but today they\u2019re also dedicated to helping people live their fullest, healthiest lives. (\u201cVita\u201d means \u201clife,\u201d after all.) Whether you\u2019re an already established entrepreneur or you\u2019ve got big dreams to become one, here are a few tips on how to get into healthy habits that will take you far along your journey.START YOUR DAY WITH FRESH FOODSYou\u2019ve heard it a million times: Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. But it wouldn\u2019t live on a loop in your head if there weren\u2019t truth to it\u2014just saying. Go light with an expertly cooked, protein-packed hard-boiled egg and a handful of antioxidant-rich blueberries, or opt for a filling, whole food\u2013packed breakfast bowl like this Tumeric Fried Eggs with Kale, Yogurt, and Bacon recipe (even healthy dishes deserve a touch of bacon). Either way, you\u2019ll get your body and brain ready to tackle whatever comes your way.MAKE THE MOST OF YOUR TIMEPart of any successful job, especially the one in which you are the CEO, marketing director, creative lead, and finance department, is exceptional time-management skills. Vitamix not only frees up time for you to, say, run the world, but they also use technology that works. The Aer Disc Container is designed so that liquid ingredients are pulled through small holes in the spinning disc, aerating and emulsifying them, while ingredients such as frozen fruit, herbs, and vegetables are agitated, but not pur\u00e9ed.Need to impress potential investors at dinner? Just wishing for more hours in the day? Whip up cream for a homemade pie, emulsify a dressing, froth foam for an after-dinner latte, or muddle fruits for drinks like this dreamy Beauty-Food Mango Slushy, which was served at the Healthyish Homecoming to refresh attendees (plus, investors love slushies!).SEE HOW THE OTHERS DID ITAn essential part of powering through ups and downs of entrepreneurship is staying optimistic. To do something that\u2019s never been done before\u2014or at least something you\u2019ve never done before\u2014you\u2019ve got to be crazy determined enough to believe you can do it. One of the best ways to accomplish that is to get perspective on how it happened for other entrepreneurs. Choose a handful of business owners or thought-leaders you admire, and read everything you can get your hands on about their story\u2014where they came from, how they persevered, and how they\u2019re challenging themselves regularly. Chances are they have myriad tales that will inspire you to keep moving full-steam ahead.DO DINNER ON THE GO\u2014OR NOTWe\u2019re all familiar with the liquid lunch, but we\u2019re talking about an actually sufficient meal here. Whether you\u2019re knee-deep in a business proposal and can\u2019t tear yourself away, or know that tomorrow night you\u2019ll be running from one meeting to the next, dinner can be deliciously served in minimum time with maximum results. We love this Corn and Red Pepper Soup with Cheesy Croutons for its vitamin C\u2013packed ingredients, easy-to-make instructions, and delicious flavor. Enjoy it at your desk, the dinner table, or on the run. Now back to work!Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
