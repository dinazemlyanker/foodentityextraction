Don\u2019t screw this up.By MacKenzie Chung FeganDecember 16, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Laura MurrayFacebookTwitterEmailIf there wasn\u2019t cheesecake at your high school keggers, you didn\u2019t grow up with Rick Martinez. When Rick was sixteen, his mom got him a subscription to Bon App\u00e9tit (look at him now!), and he soon became the guy who\u2019d show up at his friends\u2019 parties bearing elaborate, multi-layer desserts. \u201cI was like, \u2018This mocha ganache will really complement the flavors of your trash can punch,\u2019\u201d he says. Rick\u2019s always been Rick.On one occasion, he spent all afternoon baking a particularly fussy cheesecake only to realize he didn\u2019t have any way to actually transport it. As he carried it out to the car, carefully balancing it in his hands, his family\u2019s German Shepherd bounded up behind him, jumped, and pushed him with what Rick swears was malicious intent. The cheesecake went flying. The dog feasted.This holiday season, as you\u2019re ferrying your festive baked goods to office parties and cookie swaps, learn from Teen Rick\u2019s mistakes\u2014just like he did\u2014and get the Baker\u2019s Sto N Go.Rick \u201cSugar Man\u201d Martinez, in all his baking glory.\nThe sturdy, shelved plastic suitcase of this cookie and cake carrier allows you to carry up to four layers of sweets. The sides are grooved, so you can adjust the three shelves like racks in an oven in order to accommodate both thin lace cookies and chunky blondies. The packaging touts that it can fit thirty-two mini cupcakes, up to forty cookies, or a 13-by-9 pan of brownies; remove all the shelves, and you can fit an entire bundt cake or an eight-inch layer cake or pie. Or forgo the baked goods entirely and jump on the plastic purse trend. It\u2019s basically couture!But is it necessary?\u201cLook,\u201d says Rick, \u201cif I\u2019m dealing with a hardier, undecorated cookie, like the Chewy Ginger-Rye, I\u2019ll stack them in a quart container and call it a day.\u201d For cookies that require more care, like the Alfajores with Coconut Dulce de Leche, he\u2019ll pack \u2018em in a bakery box, either in a single layer or nestled in between layers of parchment. (A pizza box is an acceptable substitute, so start making friends at your local joint.) But for glamorous, high-maintenance, swap-winning cookies like these Tie-Dye Butter Cookies, Rick takes no chances.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely hardcore,\u201d he says, \u201cbut, if you\u2019re going to win your cookie swap, this is what you need.\u201dBuy it: Baker\u2019s Sto N Go, $37 on AmazonAll products featured on bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
