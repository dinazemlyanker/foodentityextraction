But I\u2019m here to tell you about pi\u00f1on,\u201d writes recipe developer Gabriella Vigoreaux. \u201cLike its close cousin pastel\u00f3n, this cheesy layered casserole is often compared to lasagna, but the flavors couldn\u2019t be more different. Ground beef is simmered with sofrito and tomato, then studded with raisins and olives to make a picadillo. Layered with mozzarella and fried sweet plantains and baked, it makes the ultimate sweet- and-savory mash-up. I\u2019m willing to wager that no two Puerto Rican families make pi\u00f1on the same way, and this is my family\u2019s version, taught to me by my grandmother, Helga, and her sister Elsie. (I choose to omit what some would consider an essential ingredient, canned French green beans. This is not because I balk at canned vegetables\u2014I just don\u2019t like green beans!) You can add a couple layers of green beans into the mix if you want. Use store-bought adobo seasoning or make it yourself. Store-bought is much saltier than homemade, so if you go that route, don\u2019t salt the meat or the sofrito.\u201dAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Coarsely chop 1 medium onion, 4 aj\u00ed dulce peppers or 1 red bell pepper, 1 Cubanelle pepper or green bell pepper, and 1 small bunch culantro or cilantro and add to food processor. Pulse until combined but still slightly textured (like a tapenade). Set aside.Step 2Using the tip of your knife, make shallow lengthwise cuts in the skin of 6 ripe (yellow) plantains (about 4 lb.) to score, then peel. Slice each plantain in half crosswise, then slice in half lengthwise to make 4 pieces for each. Halve each piece lengthwise again (you should end up with 8 thin slices per plantain). If you're feeling fancy, you can also skip the crosswise slice and go for thin, full-length plantain slices, like in the photo.Step 3Heat 1 cup vegetable oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high. Working in batches, fry plantains in a single layer, turning halfway through, until golden brown, about 5 minutes per batch. Transfer to paper towels to drain, sprinkle with kosher salt, and let cool. Reserve oil for another use or discard. Reserve skillet.Step 4Slice \u00bd cup pimiento-stuffed manzanilla olives crosswise and set aside. Heat 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil in reserved skillet over medium. Add 1 cup sofrito (freeze extra sofrito in ice cube trays, then transfer to a freezer bag or airtight container; use whenever you\u2019re starting a recipe with sofrito!) and 1 cup tomato sauce and cook, stirring, until sofrito begins to soften, 5 minutes. Add 1 lb. lean ground beef and 1 Tbsp. homemade or store-bought adobo seasoning and cook, stirring, until browned, about 8 minutes. Add \u00bd cup raisins, \u00bc cup dry red wine, and reserved olives. Cover skillet (use a baking sheet if you don\u2019t have a lid), reduce heat to low, and simmer 15 minutes. This is your picadillo.Step 5Preheat oven to 350\u00b0. Lightly coat a 13x9\" baking dish with oil. Whisk 3 large eggs in a small bowl. Arrange a third of the fried plantain slices in baking dish in a single layer, piecing together any broken ones. Top with half of the picadillo, then \u00bd cup shredded mozzarella. Repeat with half of remaining plantains, remaining picadillo, and another \u00bd cup shredded mozzarella. Top with remaining plantains. Pour whisked eggs evenly over\u00a0and let sink in.Step 6Bake pi\u00f1on, uncovered, until set, 20\u201325 minutes. Remove from oven and sprinkle with remaining \u00bd\u20131 cup shredded mozzarella (depending on your level of ). Return to oven and bake until cheese is melted, about 4 minutes. Let pi\u00f1on cool 5\u201310 minutes before cutting into squares and serving.Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesHow would you rate Pi\u00f1on?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (19)Back to TopTriangleI have made this dish several times now, and I absolutely love it. However, I did slightly adapt the original recipe to suit my preferences. First, double the Piccadillo, otherwise it's starch heavy w/ too many plantains. Second, not an adaptation of the original but I do use homemade adobo seasoning. The store bought adobo has FAR too much salt. Third, simmer Piccadillo w/ o lid to reduce by 1/3 to 1/2. This way it may it easier for eggs to set but still have plenty of sauce.\nOptional steps I did on my second time are using the air fryer for the plantains, ground turkey rather than ground beef, and omitted the cheese for authenticity and to reduce fat. Overall, I didn't notice a difference in flavor between the turkey and the beef. The plantains did take longer to cook with different texture when using air fryer, but worth it for reduction in fat. Its just as good without cheese as the flavor, just depends on your wish to maintain authenticity to traditional version.AnonymousHouston, TX10/21/2021This looks so delicious! I don\u2019t love frying things in oil. I can be a messy cook and I always make a mess when I try to fry something. Is there a way to bake the plantain slices to brown/crisp them a little?AnonymousWashington, DC10/19/2021It definitely sounds and looks super good and simple to make! I will certainly try this version of it ! Thanks!NieveFairfield, ct7/3/2021Very happy with this dish, and I'll make it again.  And again! We're not big meat eaters, but I'll make an exception for this.  Recipe was made as printed, and we thought it was was delicious!  Decadent, with all of that meat and cheese, but such a nice treat.  So, to be clear -if I understand this correctly, yellow plantains, when completely ripe are completely black.   And very, very sweet.  Did not add green beans.   I made extra sofrito and froze it, and it was fine for batch #2.  The raisins, the olives - the whole sweet/salty thing was really nice. Cook-EPhiladelphia Burbs3/21/2021I wanted to like this more. The picadillo had good flavor but I agree with others that the plantains were the issue. I cooked the plantains longer than the recipe advised just to get them softer in texture, but they needed to be even softer than they turned out. I would have also liked more 'sauce' in the dish - if I made this again I would use all the sofrito to get that sauciness.

I agree with another reviewer that the plantains made it a little too thick and starch-heavy. I think in the future, I would half the number of plantains and slice them into thinner pieces, and maybe double the picadillo (which was DELICIOUS)....and I will never ever be shamed into omitting cheese, sorry yall :P \n\nDefinitely making it again, just with modifications! AnonymousMissoula MT11/19/2020My family did not enjoy this recipe.Although I am a very experienced home chef I still  follow recipes exactly  an the first pass then change if I think adjustments need to be made This recipe is entirely too heavy with plantains and they recommended cooking time was not long enough and had too cook twice as long. The meat was delicious  and I\u2019ll probably use the spices in the future as it is basically a picadillo taco flavor mix.This dish will not be repeated.AnonymousHouston, TX11/7/2020NO Cheese!   Never!  Adding cheese to everything is how US cooks ruin international food. AnonymousPuerto Rico10/26/2020If caponata & lasagna had a love-child in Puerto Rico this would be it. And my Italian parents enjoyed it :)AnonymousSan Diego, CA10/17/2020Cheese?  In pi\u00f1on?  Blasphemy!  \ud83d\ude02AnonymousUpstate New York10/16/2020Thank you for this recipe. It it sweet, savory, and has the best textures! I made the picadillo a day ahead then heated it up after frying the plantains and it made the dish feel quicker- plus I think picadillo only gets better after a day or two. This is definitely my new favorite comfort food! cronimaMaine10/15/2020Made this last night and it was AMAZING! Love love love this recipe. So delicious AnonymousGeorgia10/7/2020I grew up eating this fish! My mom used to make this for us all the time with green beans (not canned but frozen, thawed) and without raisins. She also used queso blanco instead of mozzarella. I do love that every family has their own variation!\nI was wondering if this is something that could be prepped in the morning then baked at night? Thanks for the recipe! Can\u2019t wait to try it!RamirezCarolinaJersey City10/7/2020This brings back memories of my abuela's cooking.  The recipe is very close to how she would make it.
