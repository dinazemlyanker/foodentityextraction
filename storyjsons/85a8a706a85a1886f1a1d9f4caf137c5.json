But there are a handful of features that distinguish the best drip coffee makers; the ones that can consistently brew a cup of joe that will knock your house slippers off. My favorite is the Moccamaster Technivorm KBT, which produces the best homemade drip coffee I\u2019ve ever tasted. It reliably churns out coffee that\u2019s smooth, never sour or bitter, and actually evokes the tasting notes listed on a bag of beans. My college coffeepot could never.Technivorm Moccamaster KBT Coffee Brewer$329 at Amazon$340 at Sur La Table$319 at Food52To learn more about the features and specs that play a part in why some machines brew superior coffee, I turned to Cara Mitchell, public education manager at Joe Coffee, a chain of caf\u00e9s in NYC that has been in business for 19 years. Joe\u2019s house drip coffee has been dependably excellent for the seven years I\u2019ve been sipping it, first as a university student and more recently as an occasional pick-me-up on the way to work. Mitchell chalks up the quality of their brew to using great beans that have been roasted within 30 days of use and machines that heat and distribute water in just the right ways.To help me understand the difference between a $30 drip coffee maker and a machine that costs four times that amount, I asked Mitchell what I\u2019m actually paying for. Generally, \u201cthe more expensive machines are maintaining water temperature much better than the less expensive coffee makers,\u201d she says, which helps extract maximum flavor from your beans. \u201cThey\u2019re also dispensing the water a little more evenly over the bed of coffee [grounds]. And both of those things are really important.\u201d The takeaway: Investing in a solid machine will result in a difference you can taste.The Moccamaster is the best drip coffee maker I\u2019ve used. It brews a full 10-cup pot in six minutes or so\u2014a literal lifesaver during the months I got to know its ins and outs while staying with family who use and swear by it too. Its copper heating element keeps the water temperature within the ideal range of 195\u2013205 degrees Fahrenheit, meaning that our household of five adults was treated to consistently smooth coffee day after day. \u201cWhen it comes to brewing coffee, you want to make sure that the water temperature is as even as possible throughout the entire brewing process,\u201d Mitchell explains. And this machine\u2019s temperature control is excellent: The conical filter basket positions the coffee grounds so that the water flows through (gravity!) rather than pooling in the filter basket and potentially over extracting the coffee, which is usually the culprit behind bitter brews.Of all its charms, my favorite feature of the Moccamaster Technivorm KBT is that it doesn\u2019t use a glass pot and hot plate to keep your batch warm. Instead, coffee is brewed directly into a thermal carafe that maintains the temperature, as opposed to \u201ccooking\u201d it the way the machines with glass carafes and hot plates tend to do. \u201cIf you leave it too long on that hot plate, it\u2019s going to end up tasting, well, not as good as if you maybe drank it 45 minutes earlier,\u201d cautions Mitchell. \u201cThose insulated carafes will keep your brew hot, but they\u2019re not going to continue to extract the coffee.\u201dWhile I love the Moccamaster Technivorm KBT, it\u2019s not the only drip coffee maker on the market that meets Mitchell\u2019s criteria for brewing great-tasting coffee. If you\u2019re looking for something less expensive, more glamorous, or slightly smaller, we\u2019ve got options for you as well.The Best Less-Expensive (but Still Fancy) Drip Coffee Maker\u201cWhenever I think of coffee, I always want to make sure that it is as accessible as possible, and I always like to tell people that they don't have to have the most expensive equipment in order to get the best coffee at home,\u201d says Mitchell, who recommends Oxo\u2019s 8-cup drip coffee maker. It\u2019s a \u201cgreat entry-level machine at an excellent price point,\u201d she says, especially in comparison to big-ticket brewers on the market.OXO Brew 8 Cup Coffee Maker$178 at Amazon$178 at Sur La Table$178 at OXOThe Oxo comes with a lot of the features commonly found in drip coffee machines above the $200 price point: a focus on maintaining consistent water temperature, an expansive showerhead to evenly distribute water over the bed of coffee grounds, and a certification by the SCA (that\u2019s the Specialty Coffee Association) that the machine meets its standards for brewing great quality coffee. As a bonus the Oxo also includes a special filter you can use to brew a single cup of coffee\u2014no pods or single-use plastic required. If I hadn\u2019t already splurged on a home espresso machine, I\u2019d seriously be stumped between shelling out for my own Moccamaster or opting for the Oxo brewer.The Best Small Drip Coffee MakerBonavita, a coffee machine manufacturer with several SCA-certified products, also happens to make this petite 5-cup brewer that meets Mitchell\u2019s criteria. It can brew anywhere from three to five cups and maintains that ideal temperature range for optimal extraction. It\u2019s available on Amazon and its plastic parts are all dishwasher-safe. It also happens to be the most affordable machine, albeit, without all the bells and whistles of the Oxo 8-cup brewer, on our list.Bonavita 5 Cup Coffee Maker$100 at Bed Bath and Beyond$130 at AmazonThe Best-Looking Drip Coffee MakerOur pick with the most countertop appeal also happens to be the highest-capacity brewer on our list: Zwilling\u2019s Enfinigy drip coffee maker can brew up to 12 cups and looks downright futuristic (like a chic robot). This brewer has a stainless-steel boiler that the brand says is corrosion-resistant, so it won\u2019t impart funky flavors into your coffee. While I didn\u2019t love that it had a glass carafe and hot plate, I was intrigued by the fact that the hot plate stays on for only 30 minutes before the machine automatically shuts down. The fact that it keeps track of when it needs to be cleaned, and has an easy-to-use cleaning setting, also ups its convenience factor in a major way.Zwilling Enfinigy$200 at Amazon$200 at Bed Bath & BeyondMore caffeine-fueled content from BA\u2019s Coffee Week:The Best Ways to Make Coffee, According to BaristasThis Reusable Coffee Filter Means I Never Worry About Running OutThe Coffee to Water Ratio That Makes a Perfect BrewThis Flash-Frozen Concentrate Is Revolutionizing the Way I Drink CoffeeYou Should Add Spices to Your Coffee GroundsExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingRecipes you want to make.
