In \"There's No Better Time To...\" we'll share the little projects we're finally getting around to. This week: Go ahead and open that can of fancy tuna.There are the people who eat their favorite Halloween candies first, and then there are those who save the best stuff for last. I fall into the latter camp. Stashed away on the top shelf of the pantry and the back of the bar cart are small luxuries that I\u2019ve put away for a rainy day, like a squirrel with a scarcity mentality.This week something snapped. If not now, when? What exactly am I saving an inch of good Cognac or a small handful of Danish licorices for if not a literal global pandemic? We\u2019ve been stripped of so many small pleasures, from hugging our friends to eating a croissant from a favorite bakery. Couple that with the larger, weightier losses many have suffered\u2014from jobs to a sense of security to loved ones\u2014and the only recourse is to find joy where we can. And so a couple of nights ago, I drew myself a bath, willing myself not to skimp on the fancy bath salts I was gifted four years ago, and poured myself the last few sips from a bottle of BenRiach 25-year-old Scotch. It\u2019s my birthday on Sunday, but even if it weren\u2019t, this weekend\u2019s plans would involve oysters ordered from my new fish delivery guy and a bottle of Besserat de Bellefon Champagne that\u2019s been chilling in my fridge since last fall.This is the emergency. Take the tiny hammer and break the glass.I asked some Bon App\u00e9tit staffers about what Special Occasion Treats they\u2019ve been dipping into:Hilary Cadigan admits that she probably should have eaten her fancy pecans from the Peach Truck long ago, but instead she\u2019s been hoarding them in her freezer, rationing them out to top her ice cream. Their time is finally up. Hilary says, \u201cI'm going to bite the bullet and bake them all into my next batch of brownies.\u201dJoey Hernandez and his significant other are having \u201cactive discussions\u201d about breaking into their micro-cellar of Bordeaux, Barolo, and Champagne. Their anniversary last week went largely uncelebrated, so if I may weigh in Joey\u2014one of each.It's a fine time for wine time.\nPhoto by Alex LauAliza Abarbanel has been socking away her stash of Rancho Gordo\u2019s poignantly named Royal Coronas\u2014plump beans so big they rival the size of an eight-year-old\u2019s ear. She saved them for months, cooked them last week, and just finished off the last frozen container in a blaze of lunchtime glory.Alex Beggs, a creature unlike any other, usually saves her blocks of cheap cheddar for special occasions. But the last couple of weeks have seen her tear into her off-brand cheese and the stash of HEB tortillas she keeps in the freezer with reckless abandon.Sarah Jampel treasures pearl sugar like actual pearls: \u201cIt's one of those ingredients that you can only get off the internet, and I've been hiding a quart-container's-worth in the back of my pantry for...years now, using a tablespoon at a time to sprinkle atop homemade danishes or the most special of muffins.\u201d But she\u2019s throwing caution to the wind and gearing up to make li\u00e8ge waffles, \u201cwhich incorporate cups of pearl sugar for caramelized edges and punctuations of crunchy sweetness.\u201dChristina Chaey is to luxe pantry items as her dad is to credit card points: \u201cwe hoard and hoard without knowing exactly what we're saving for.\u201d She\u2019s kept a precious tin of El Capricho tuna hidden away until this week. What broke her? \u201cThe warmest spring day yet, which made me crave a highly specific lunch of cold boiled potatoes, a lemony salad of crisp lettuces and herbs, and a mound of the rich, rosy tuna with flaky salt and a squeeze of fresh lemon. Perfection.\u201dBryan Fountain is eyeing the \u201ctube of foie gras in the fridge I was saving for I don\u2019t know what,\u201d but he\u2019s afraid it\u2019s too much for him to eat alone\u2014his girlfriend is a vegetarian. Eat the tube, Bryan. Eat the whole damn tube.Explore Bon App\u00e9titThere's No Better Time CoronavirusBasicallyRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
