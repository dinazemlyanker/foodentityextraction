He\u2019s living proof, and recommends pairing that cheeseburger with something light and uplifting, like his go-to KeVita Master Brew Kombucha Raspberry Lemon. It\u2019s a refreshing tidbit from this keeping-it-real entrepreneur who\u2019s led some of the largest meditations in the world. It really is all about balance.While meditation wasn\u2019t always his jam, he\u2019s always appreciated a good burger. Israel was a sophomore at New York University when he and his roommate started managing a musical act. By graduation, the band was award-nominated and a global sensation, and he was soon running Cantora, a major record label that he co-founded in 2005. That\u2019s when he began suffering from debilitating anxiety and panic attacks.During this time, Israel resorted to internet-sourced meditation techniques to cope, simply because meditation classes weren\u2019t as popular as they are now. \u201cWhen I was 29 and had a regular practice, I found a deep calling to move on from my business and start exploring new things.\u201dThis eureka moment began with what he calls community experiments: the first being a \u201ccheeseburger club.\u201d It started with a group of guys who would meet for beer and burgers. \u201cIt became a support group for 10 of my closest friends, and a place for us to talk about real stuff that we didn\u2019t always have permission to talk about. It was a sense of small community that I didn\u2019t have,\u201d says Israel and adds, \u201cIt was the first time I got a taste of the power to be yourself and be supported and heard.\u201d They called themselves the Burger Boys and the group expanded to Europe and Los Angeles. Soon thereafter, in 2013, a new community experiment began during a casual bike ride with 18 friends from the music industry. \u201cWe went on a slow cruise to Coney Island, went on the Cyclone roller coaster, and when we came back, the sun was setting and we decided to become a bike club and called ourselves the Cyclones.\u201d 40 people joined the next ride and by the end of summer, the Cyclones consisted of hundreds of people. Through this Israel learned to conquer his fear and anxiety of public speaking by literally leading bike rides and leaning into the community experience he helped to create.\u201cWhen I left Cantora I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do next, but I knew I wanted something with similar values of community experience.\u201d As it turns out, it was another group\u2014this time a meditation club that he called Medi Club: a group of 20 folks who gathered in a friend\u2019s loft apartment to meditate. \u201cIt was amazing but also awkward,\u201d he said because the room was filled with a bunch of successful people who\u2019d never been together in silence. The result? Sharing real-life experiences and feelings and Israel\u2019s realization as to what he\u2019d do next. Within four or five months, there would be 100 people jammed into the loft.This led to The Big Quiet, his mass meditation movement. It began in June 2015 at a Central Park outdoor music festival held in Rumsey Playfield where tons of New Yorkers showed up for a big quiet experience. \u201cI was terrified but it was a huge part of what I was meant to do, and I\u2019ve since dedicated myself to this work.\u201d It was this very moment when his music career and new passion came full circle. He\u2019s since performed in a jam-packed arena, lead the first meditation at the World Trade Center Oculus, and organized a session under a giant blue whale in a museum.Today, Israel brings his expertise to Fortune 500 companies where he helps people understand that by ushering self-care into their personal lives, you can then weave it into your corporate culture. After his talk, he\u2019ll lead a guided meditation with the group, and for longer sessions, he works with human resource teams to dedicate a conference room for meditation. \u201cIf a corporation is willing to invest this time, it will change their corporate culture and how they reach their customers; it\u2019s so powerful.\u201dAt this point, when he\u2019s not teaching the importance of self-care to professionals, he\u2019s practicing a modern version himself, where balance and burgers aren\u2019t off the table. With a KeVita Master Brew Kombucha Raspberry Lemon and confidence in his authentic and relatable true-self, Israel feels that he can try something new that makes him feel alive. Mornings begin with meditation, exercise, and work. He might indulge in one of those burgers he loves for lunch, and because of the whole balance thing, Israel will later meditate in his co-working space where hundreds of people are milling about. \u201cI\u2019ll still eat cheeseburgers and l love rap. I think of meditation as a modern lifestyle, not my lifestyle.\u201d His self-care extends into what he calls his \u201cJ Night.\u201d He explains, \u201cI take an epsom bath, put on a face mask and stream some shows or read.\u201d Now that\u2019s refreshing.The information in this article is the opinion of the author(s) and in no way reflects the policies or positions of KeVita.
