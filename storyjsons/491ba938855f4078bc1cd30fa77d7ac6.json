Not that I'm a hoarder, mind you, but catching a glimpse of a tortoiseshell fork or a fluffy teddybear coat lights up my brain like a pinball machine. Nice things are nice, and now that Instagram mainlines e-commerce ephemera into my brain, nice things are everywhere. To set some boundaries, I've been allowing myself to buy just one beautiful (and affordable, because I'm not a millionaire) version of all the nice things I covet. And that's why I have a house bowl.A house bowl works for every eating occasion, from morning oatmeal to late-night ice cream. Mine is from Hasami Porcelain, a Japanese ceramic line helmed by creative director Takuhiro Shinomoto that draws from the Hasami district\u2019s longstanding pottery tradition to marry form and function. The brand\u2019s clear craftsmanship and relatively affordable pricing has made it a mainstay at NYC restaurants like Davelle and Takumen\u2014and my kitchen too.When I saw the shallow glazed bowl on Need Supply (my go-to site for lucite hoops and ceramic mugs alike), I clicked. I\u2019ve had my fair share of failed online purchases (see: shockingly uncomfortable sneakers, way too oversized jeans), but this bowl lived up to the product photos. The blue glaze is rich and glossy, the earthenware exterior is pleasantly matte. Of course, there are other things to love.Sticky tahini easily wipes off the porcelain glaze, which is a blessing, because I don\u2019t have a dishwasher. (For the record, this bowl is dishwasher safe, and microwave safe too.) It\u2019s durable enough for daily use\u2014I\u2019ll admit to dropping it more than once, and while my heart fell into my stomach every time, the surface never scratched. (If only I could say that about my phone.)Best of all, the shallow 7 \u2153 inch mouth is practically plate-sized. I\u2019ve used it for lentil soups, kimchi udon, and too many servings of crispy tofu over rice to count. Most often, however, it\u2019s filled with a hodgepodge of things that collectively can only be described as \u201cbowl food.\u201d A pint container of frozen beans might be excavated from the back of the freezer, sizzled in a pan with an enthusiastic shake of red pepper flakes, and served with saut\u00e9ed kale and sliced avocado. Or I\u2019ll quickly cook some grains and pile on all the leftovers my fridge holds.Hand-painted terracotta plates are gorgeous, but there\u2019s a quiet sense of satisfaction in using the same bowl day after day. It\u2019s one less decision to make, and one less plate to wash. Of course, that extra bit of free time means I'll probably end up back online, searching for the perfect thing to hang over the kitchen table. Is there such a thing as a house disco ball? It just feels right.Buy it: Hasami Porcelain Round Bowl, Gloss Blue, $36.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
