But I admit: I misread the instructions and didn't put water or oil in the dressing.  (I'm not one of those people who thinks she knows better than a recipe writer. I was simply hungry, and didn't read carefully.) It was great. AnonymousNew York, NY12/3/2021I made this for thanksgiving dinner and we all loved it. It was easy, attractive, and interesting, but not so much so that it put off the traditionalists. \n\nThe chickpeas are hard to crisp, as noted. Dry them, then. Not too much oil, high heat separately. I added them as a topping. Also put a dash of fresh sesame oil and a pinch of pepper flakes in the dressing because it seems it needed a boost - excellent. Don\u2019t skip the yogurt. Mia2Tucson11/26/2021This was so yummy! I made it vegan by using sour cashew cream instead if yogurt and it worked really well, used butternut squash and put the chickpeas in pretty early on to get them nice and crispy. All the elements on their own seem just okay but once you put it all together it's excellent. Highly recommend! Annie RVancouver, WA4/20/2021This recipe is a SLEEPER HIT. I used acorn squash instead of delicata and red onion instead of scallions. Had to use two full-sized sheet pans and a quarter sheet to fit it all. Put the chickpeas in 10 minutes earlier than the recipe says if you want them to get really crispy. Double the miso sesame sauce and use it on everythinggg. AnonymousBrooklyn, NY2/28/2021Yet another incredible Chris Morocco recipe. I made this with just the sweet potatoes and chickpeas (I didn't have squash handy) and it was absolutely delicious. I left the chickpeas in for longer to get them really crispy and I'm really happy I did. The miso dressing is absolutely delicious- wow. For a recipe so simple to make, this really has a high end restaurant feel. I can't wait to make this recipe again! Emily New York1/23/2021Slam dunk of a recipe! This hit all the right notes of savory, tangy, crunchy and a blast of umami from that dressing. Everything cooked perfectly at the intervals indicated in the recipe. My only regret is that I didn't double it! Actually, I will do twice as many sweet potatoes next time since the four of us fought over the remaining two halves after we'd each had one...delicious and very original recipe.AliWaldoboro, Maine1/8/2021Really easy, healthy, and delicious! I used half of a leftover butternut squash that I peeled and sliced. The squash and chickpeas weren't crispy, so I suspect I should've dried the chickpeas with a towel after draining, mixed them with oil in a separate bowl to make sure they were coated, and roasted everything longer. The dressing is crazy good, I might just start putting it on everything.AmandaBrooklyn, NY12/3/2020Good way to eat farm share veggies that aren't my fave! Though I used ricotta instead of yogurt, and acorn squash instead of Delicatta cuz that's what I had. it worked.emily12/2/2020So good, so easy, definitely a new favorite! Such a great blend of flavors and textures, and something that I, a novice cook, could make! Can\u2019t wait to have it again \ud83d\ude0dHanSeattle, WA11/22/2020This was so yummy, super satisfying and healthy to boot. I loved the combination of crunchy chickpeas and soft sweet potatoes.  AnonymousTrondheim, Norway10/28/2020It is rare to be surprised by a dish but this blew me away. Such a creative and delicious harmony of flavors. We ended up roasting two squash due to size and we used the long white sweet potatoes vs what appears to be pictured as smaller yams (who even knows the difference anymore, though) but that doesn't even matter because this is so. good. We took the squash out at 25 mins, used a separate baking sheet for the chickpeas, etc. Make this dish. Seriously. cbruettSalt Lake City, Utah10/12/2020I wasn\u2019t very jazzed about this recipe, but then I got around to making it (mostly to use up some sweet potatoes) and it is the freaking bomb.com. I don\u2019t even like sweet potatoes, but this salad is actually the perfect combination of flavors. Not too sweet at all. Might be my new favorite salad Carlyd731Philly 5/23/2020I happened to have a sweet potato and some green onions to use up and had everything else on hand so I decided to make this. But then I procrastinated actually making it for a few days because it just never quite sounded like the thing I wanted to eat for dinner. Let me tell you this is delicious! Healthy & filing & a really great combo of flavors. Seattle4/3/2020This was so delicious! Healthy and filling at the same time. I couldn\u2019t get delicata squash at the store, so used kombucha instead and it worked beautifully.
