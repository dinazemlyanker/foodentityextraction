Have a question? Email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.How much PDA is too much PDA at a restaurant? \u2014Touchy TrevorAny. Footsie? Violent, should be illegal. Putting food in someone else\u2019s mouth who isn\u2019t in a high chair? Repulsive. Holding hands across a table. I HATE THAT. GET A ROOM.Is it okay to eat off your date\u2019s plate? (A hungry guy friend is asking.) \u2014Audacious AdamHow dare you, sir. NO. Unless you\u2019re in a loving, committed relationship and this clause is included IN YOUR WEDDING VOWS, thou shalt not fork a single radish off my plate unless you\u2019ve been invited to. Especially French fries. There\u2019s a three fry rule of fry theft (and only one if steak fries), and after that, you better order a side for yourself. The nerve! This question comes from a place of patriarchal entitlement mixed with some stereotypes about delicate ladies who can\u2019t handle an entire quarter pounder. I\u2019m huffing and puffing. I\u2019ll blow this house of pancakes down! I\u2019M HUNGRY TOO. And don\u2019t you dare ever ask me, \u201cgonna finish that?\u201d I will m u r d e r.The following date night restaurant scenarios are RED FLAG indicators that the relationship needs to end right here and now:They\u2019re rude to waitersThey\u2019re bad tippersThey ask \u201cgonna finish that?\u201dThey tease you for not drinkingThey call the bathroom \u201cthe little boy\u2019s room\u201dThey reveal they\u2019re a starred Yelp reviewerHow do you get strong food tastes out of your mouth before making out on the sidewalk? (And without making it obvious that you anticipated the make out)? \u2014Attagirl AnnaleeAm I the only one who finds super minty kisses sort of jarring and dental? Halitosis is unfortunate and that\u2019s a whole other ball game, but just like, food tastes? WHO CARES. I love food! We probably ate the same things and have the same flavored saliva! (Martini-French-fries-mayo if things went as planned.) My first kiss was at the movies and he was eating a huge, bulging, veiny... pickle. It was a pickle juice kiss! Delightful. Things didn\u2019t work out.SNACK BREAK!Alex LauGet it? Dates. This almond and date mix gets roasted in a cast iron skillet and it\u2019s pure ROMANCE. The dates get gooey and caramelized, the almonds get toasted, there\u2019s some citrus and herbs in there to keep things interesting, and you can eat it by the handful or smash it onto crusty bread.What would you make for a Valentine's Day meal ...for one? \u2014Lone LinaPersonally? Nachos. Double layer. Tostitos (REGULAR. NOT SCOOPS), refried beans, shredded cheddar. Jar of pickled jalape\u00f1os to apply to each individual chip. But that answer isn\u2019t going to offer the opportunity to plug a Bon App\u00e9tit recipe or three. Soooo. In that case. I\u2019d do this easy yet decadent skirt steak with pan sauce with a side of Trader Joe\u2019s frozen hash browns. Drink the rest of the white wine you used in the sauce, on ice. In this scenario, however, you aren\u2019t going to watch Netflix and get all cozy. You\u2019re going to eat that steak and do some laundry, gather all the forms you need for your taxes, pay your credit card bill. Then you have my permission to pay for porn. The high quality stuff. It\u2019s called financial health.What date number is a burp okay? \u2014Belching BrittanyOne if the date\u2019s at a brewery and you do that thing where you cover your mouth and burp under your breath, which I find impossibly sexy, alluring, and mysterious. What are you doing under there? Burping? Oh you sly devil! Get into my bed!Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesWhat's a good Valentine's Day cake or dessert? \u2014Jovial JustinThese molten caramel cakes, hands down.What is your strategy to make sure Valentine\u2019s Day dinner feels rich and indulgent, but not so heavy as to put the damper on any other evening activities? \u2014Caring CeiliI\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re asking what dinner will still make you want to have sex afterward. Too heavy a meal, and you\u2019ll just want to lay on your left side and yell at the kids on MasterChef Junior. Too light and you\u2019re what, on a diet now? Here\u2019s the thing. Just make a rich and indulgent meal. I\u2019d like these lamb meatballs, please, with a crispy fennel salad. The problem with feeling gross and bloated is that our portion sizes are too big. Serve dinner on a smaller plate, make a salad, and then here\u2019s my pro move: go for a walk after dinner. It\u2019ll feel all romantic and stuff but it\u2019ll help you digest and you can crop dust the neighbor\u2019s begonias. A few hours later, after you\u2019ve cuddled under the blankets and finished the day\u2019s crossword puzzle, you\u2019ll realize morning sex is better anyway.That\u2019s all for now, but if you have any etiquette questions on the theme of TRAVELING (or anything else, honestly) or recipe requests, email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com and be too specific. I want the juicy details!Love, AlexExplore Bon App\u00e9titIs It Ever OkayEtiquetteValentines DayRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
