A hunk of nutty, salty Parmesan. The tongue-coating richness of really good caramel. The potent, bright flavor of fish sauce. But none more so than MTR Spiced Chutney Powder.I was 7. My aunt Sonia (a.k.a. Sonia Mami of garlic-ginger chicken renown) was making idlis, and I was getting ready to eat the steamed, cloud-like rice cakes the way I was used to: with lots of butter slathered on top and a spoonful of yogurt on the side. Instead, Sonia Mami brought out a packet of this chutney powder, mixed in a little bit of ghee to turn it into a paste, and set it next to my idli.Chutney powders, also known as chutney pudi or gunpowder, are common across South Indian cuisine\u2014usually as a ground blend of chiles, lentils, spices, and sometimes ingredients like dried shrimp or coconut. This one was burnt orange in color and made with red chiles, black lentils, curry leaves, mustard seeds, and asafetida. I dipped my pinky finger into the sauce, and tasted. The sensation was tangy, savory, and spicy, with the pleasant graininess you get from a good Dijon. The ghee rounded everything out. Just a little dab, and my idli was transformed. Sonia Mami gave me a packet to take home, and it became a staple of the Krishna pantry.We added the powder to ghee but also olive oil\u2014we liked the way the fruitiness of the oil complimented the spices. I ate this chutney powder by the boatload not just with idli but drizzled over sweet potatoes, sprinkled atop rice, swirled into plain yogurt, dolloped onto grilled cheese sandwiches, and spread along the inside of dosas.I fully recognize that homemade chutney powders are better than store-bought ones, and I am thankful for my mother\u2019s South Indian friends, who will always hook me up with their personal stashes when I am back home in Dallas. But for my everyday use in New York, these packets of MTR Spiced Chutney Powder do more than just fine, and are easily the most flavorful condiment in my pantry. They stand front and center in my cabinets, ready to be mixed with fat and slathered upon anything\u2014literally anything!!!\u2014that requires seasoning. My weeknight dinners/midnight snacks/lazy breakfasts/quick lunches will forever be indebted to Sonia Mami.Buy it: MTR Spiced Chutney Powder, $8 for 7-ounce bag on AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
