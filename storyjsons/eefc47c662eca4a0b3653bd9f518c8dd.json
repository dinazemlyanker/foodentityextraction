It\u2019s a traditional seasoning for congee, it's the source of heat in hot and sour soup, and it camouflages into pommes pur\u00e9e and b\u00e9chamel.White peppercorns and black peppercorns both begin as the same berry on the same pepper plant. Yep, that\u2019s right: They\u2019re a fruit! In fact, the lesser-known green and red peppercorns come from that same plant, too. Green peppercorns are harvested early in the season, in January, whereas red ones are harvested several months later, in March and April. For the sake of this article, we\u2019ll focus on black and white, both harvested in the middle of the season but treated so that they have quite distinct tastes. (Pink peppercorns come in from left field: They grow on an entirely different plant but due to their similar taste, shape, and size, have the same name.)Black peppercorns are dried as soon as they\u2019re picked. Their skin becomes black and shriveled  (look closely at whole black peppercorns\u2014they\u2019re super wrinkly). The taste is quite biting\u2014spicy but not necessarily hot. Use enough of it and it\u2019ll make your mouth tingle.So wrinkly, like miniature prunes.\u00a0\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigWhite peppercorns, on the other hand, are soaked before they\u2019re dried so that that outer layer comes off. The surface underneath is smooth and, yes, white. \u201cThe taste is brighter and sharper and more herbaceous than black pepper,\u201d says chef, author, and spice expert Lior Lev Sercarz. \u201cSome varieties even have a little bit of a piney, resin-y aroma.\u201dThat being said, white peppercorns can be poorly processed, meaning that they\u2019re packaged before all of the water has evaporated. When that happens, they develop a slightly fermented, barnyard-y flavor, which only increases the longer they sit.In order to find the best-tasting white pepper you can, Sercarz recommends researching your source. But if you don\u2019t have a specific purveyor you love, there are some things to look out for: The color should be a creamy white\u2014not beige, but also not bleach white (sometimes sulfur or other chemicals are added to make the peppercorns look extra bright). Their size should be as uniform as possible, with no visible specks of gray or black. And a mention of origin on the label is also a good sign.Once you have a jar (for the freshest flavor possible, we recommend buying whole peppercorns, then grinding them yourself), try adding it to marinades, soups, stews, and stir-fries. It pairs particularly nicely with pork, but will bring an earthy heat wherever you put it.\u201cWhen it\u2019s good, it\u2019s really good,\u201d Sercarz says. \u201cThere\u2019s sadly not enough awareness of pepper in general. We had the salt revolution a few years ago. Perhaps pepper will be next.\u201dGet the recipe:Pork and Shiitake CongeeSince congee can take hours to make on the stovetop, we came up with a clever trick: Rinse the rice and freeze it overnight.\u00a0View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPeppercornWhite PepperRecipes you want to make.
