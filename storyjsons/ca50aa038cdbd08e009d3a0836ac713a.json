Do you want a heritage bird or a classic grocery store bird-in-a-bag? Fresh or frozen? Whole or parts? And, arguably the most important consideration of all: Just how big should that bird be?To calculate the exact number, you need to figure out how many people you\u2019re serving and how much turkey you need per person. After all, if you\u2019re hosting Thanksgiving, it\u2019s your mission to send everyone home as full of delicious food as possible.Here\u2019s how to buy the right sized bird for the job:How many pounds of turkey do I need per person?The general rule of thumb is 1\u20131\u00bd pounds turkey per person. If that seems like a lot, remember that a whole turkey comes with a lot of parts that don\u2019t end up getting eaten. \u201cWhen you buy a whole turkey, a lot of it is bone,\u201d says assistant food editor Jessie YuChen, and the smaller the bird, the higher that percentage may be. That\u2019s why, for smaller gatherings, Jessie recommends going all the way to 2 pounds per person to maximize leftovers (more on that later). \u201cFor four to six people, 11 to 13 pounds is a good range,\u201d Jessie says.That might seem like a lot of bird, but remember: Beyond the bones, the mass of your whole bird also accounts for cartilage and less favorable cuts of meat around the shoulders, neck, and back that are better for making stock the next day than for serving on the big night. Just because you\u2019re buying a pound for each guest, it\u2019s not the same as serving everyone a 16-oz. rib eye.What if I\u2019m afraid of under-serving my guests?\u201cI think that most people put out so many sides that running out of turkey just really isn\u2019t an issue,\u201d says contributing editor Amiel Stanek. \u201cTurkey is, in my experience, the thing that people want least.\u201d As a host, then, you can take some of your attention away from the cartoonishly large bird and think deeply about the side dishes. The sides are where you can customize your selection based on the size, tastes, and needs of your crowd. Serving a few extra vegetarians this year? Go all-in on salads, casseroles, and roasted veggies. Want to show off your hard-earned quarantine baking skills? Make a big tray of showstopping stuffing biscuits.Amiel also points out that the bigger the turkey, the less likely it is to cook evenly. He would much rather serve smallish portions of perfect poultry than massive servings that are half-raw, half-dry. \u201cIn terms of ensuring that the breast meat is delicious and moist and the dark meat is cooked through, I think you\u2019re going to get the best results from a 14-to-15-pound bird, max.\u201dIf that sounds teeny tiny compared to your guest list, Amiel and Jessie recommend serving a different meat or protein (no matter your party\u2019s size). \u201cI like to do steak or lamb chops,\u201d says Jessie, \u201cwhich are also very festive and are a lot easier to prepare than a whole turkey.\u201d Having a second meat on the table not only provides a backup if your bird is on the scrawny side, but it also makes your turkey stretch further (I mean, between a slice of seared rib eye and a piece of white breast meat, what are you reaching for?). Aim for 1\u20131\u00bd total pounds of protein here and you\u2019ll have nothing to worry about.What if I\u2019m serving turkey to a really big crowd?We get it, everyone\u2019s getting vaccinated, we\u2019re excited to see our friends and families again, and suddenly your guest list is ballooning. If, despite our advice, you\u2019ve ended up with a massive bird and are worried about cooking it evenly, consider breaking it down into smaller parts for more control over individual cook times. \u201cTake the legs off and cook them separately from the breasts,\u201d says Amiel, \u201cyou can even slow-roast them until they\u2019re really tender and falling apart the day before, then reheat them while you\u2019re roasting the breasts.\u201dEven broken down, that jumbo bird is going to take up lots of oven space. To save on precious real estate, you can also take parts of the meal prep outside, weather permitting. Once your turkey is in pieces, those breasts, thighs, and legs are perfect candidates for grilling. Not only will this get you out of the kitchen here and there (and let\u2019s be honest, anyone cooking a Thanksgiving feast could probably use some fresh air), it\u2019ll bring smoky flavors to a protein that\u2019s known for trending bland.What if you STILL end up with way too many leftovers?It happens to the best of us. No matter how much turkey per person you prepared for, there\u2019s bound to be one cousin who went vegan last year, or an uncle who got stuck at O\u2019Hare, or too many good-tasting appetizers to fill up on. However you got here, you\u2019re stuck with very many resealable plastic bags full of leftover turkey.Fret not, though, because there\u2019s plenty of ways to repurpose those leftovers into delicious meals without letting things get overly repetitive. \u201cI think that as far as your first couple of days of leftovers consumption are concerned, cold breast meat sandwiches are the way to go,\u201d Amiel says. That\u2019s because the dark meat is slower to dry out, so getting through the white meat should be step one.From there, you can turn bone-in dark meat and whatever\u2019s left of the bird\u2019s skeleton into homemade stock, which can be portioned out and frozen, and will bring way more flavor to soups, sauces, and braises than the boxed stuff.As for the dark meat that\u2019s already been carved, you can shred it up for quick tacos at lunchtime, add it to your homemade stock for a quick, comforting soup, or\u2014if you want something truly impressive\u2014mix it up with any leftover gravy and veggies to make pot pies, which freeze well and make incredibly lazy dinners down the road.But before you let the promise of delicious leftovers convince you to buy the biggest Butterball you can get your hands on, think about yourself on Thanksgiving day. Hosting any event is stressful enough without a literal feast to prepare, and an unnecessarily huge bird is just another headache you don\u2019t need.\u201cMy tip is just to plan ahead,\u201d says Jessie. \u201cThe goal for the meal is to have a beautiful spread and have everyone fed, and you don\u2019t need a gigantic turkey to do that.\u201d After the year we\u2019ve all had, it\u2019s safe to say that your guests will be satisfied just because they\u2019re together again. Keep things simple, enjoy the company, and always\u2014ALWAYS\u2014outsource the cleanup.Explore Bon App\u00e9titcookingThanksgivingRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
