Pizza is waiting for you.By AutotraderFebruary 18, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailTalula'sMICHAEL PERSICOFacebookTwitterEmailPizza is a hot topic in the Northeast. Competition is steep between New York City and Boston alone, and that doesn\u2019t even include the college towns along the way. (Looking at you, New Haven.) What better way to taste some of the most buzzed-about, fussed-over, vehemently debated pizza than on a road trip? This comprehensive list takes a knee\u2013\u2013and a slice\u2013\u2013at some of the hottest heavy hitters, newcomers, and all-around standouts in the American Northeast.First Stop: PhillyPhiladelphia is teeming with sights worth seeing, enticing plenty of road trippers with historical landmarks and museums, but its pizza scene is equally as legendary. Like the city itself, the pizza contingency is a mix of traditional, old-world joints and Instagram-friendly newbies, but one must-stop? Santucci\u2019s. It\u2019s been around since 1959, and was first made famous for its square pies. While you may be tempted by old-world comfort dishes like short rib gravy fries with provolone whiz, you can\u2019t leave The City of Brotherly Love without a signature Santucci\u2019s pie.Talula's\nMICHAEL PERSICOA Slice of JerseyFrom Philly, head east into New Jersey and hit the coast. There, Pete & Elda\u2019s has been serving their famed thin-crust pizza in Neptune City for more than 50 years. Those who finish an XXL pizza\u2013\u2013which is 18 inches in diameter\u2013\u2013win a free t-shirt. But nearly everyone who\u2019s ever been to the Asbury Park area will tell you that going to Talula\u2019s is nonnegotiable. Their pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is high-quality, seasonal, and sustainably grown ingredients in a space with a hip, casual aesthetic and a cool beachside menu. You could order the shaved brussels sprout salad, but this is a pizza tour, remember? Next, make your way north into Jersey City for Razza, the wood-oven pizza known for excelling at both bread\u2013\u2013homemade and milled in nearby Clifton\u2013\u2013and toppings, which are handpicked right down to the salt.Since you\u2019re scooting around several states, be sure you\u2019ve got a solid set of wheels to get you there. Before you even begin your pizza sojourn, take a look at Autotrader, which is the most complete online car shopping destination. They save you time (which we all know: is money) and they make the car buying process easier for you.  What could be better? And with all the stops you\u2019ll want to make in and around New York City, a reliable ride is imperative\u2013\u2013because that\u2019s exactly where you\u2019re going next.Emmy Squared\nNo Contest in New York CityThere is no disputing the multitude of memorable slices in and around the New York City metro area. There\u2019s legends like Lucali, Mark Iacono\u2019s famed Carroll Gardens mainstay that\u2019s so accustomed to overflow that their website preemptively explains that guests should \u201cShow up before 5. Put your name on the list. Go have a drink.\u201d  Make your way back to North Brooklyn and put in your name at Ops, the new-wave, jam-packed, no-reservations Bushwick joint with freshly baked sourdough-crust pies. Emmy Squared in neighboring Williamsburg, and now in the East Village and Upper East Side, brings trendy, square Detroit-style pizzas to NYC crust lovers, while the Lower East Side\u2019s Una Pizza Napoletana is easily one of the best Neapolitan pizza places below 14th Street.The Notables of New HavenOn your way from NYC to Boston, you\u2019ll drive right past New Haven, known for a certain Ivy League college and, naturally, its pizza. Because every good college town needs a reliable pizza scene. At Sally\u2019s Apizza, this storied spot has been using the same coal-fired oven for their handmade pies for 80 years. And for those seeking a new-age pie with a trendy twist, BAR New Haven serves classic and eclectic pies (like bacon and mashed potato pizza) at a space that\u2019s part pizzeria, part brewery, and part dance club. With this much going on, how could one ever find time to study?BAR New Haven\nThe Best of BostonWhile Bostonians can be passionate about a lot of things (baseball, coffee, traffic), they thankfully can agree on some of the city\u2019s most famous pizzerias. You can\u2019t pass through without stopping at Regina\u2019s, founded in 1926 in the North End by Luigi D\u2019Auria but passed on to the Polcari family in 1956. The heritage empire prides themselves on a century-old dough recipe, specially crafted sauce, aged whole milk mozzarella, and always-fresh toppings. On the other side of the aisle is Santarpio\u2019s. What started out as a bakery in 1903 has evolved into one of the city\u2019s greatest pizza landmarks serving some of the tastiest New York-style pizzas this side of Massachusetts.If you\u2019ve committed to driving across several states for the best pizza in town, you want to be confident that you\u2019ve found the right car to get you there\u2013\u2013and at a fair price. That\u2019s the beauty of Autotrader.
