It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Live footage of me on the weekendSome of us need something to live for, and that thing is cooking on the weekend. This week I learned that associate editor Christina Chaey starts planning her weekend cooking on Tuesday. \u201cThe thought exercise gets me through the week,\u201d she said. (FYI: She\u2019s making this mushroom pasta and Chris Morocco\u2019s \u201cmagnifique\u201d Italian salad.) Food director Carla Lalli Music told me about her family\u2019s epic meal planning: \u201cTuesday would be the day we get the first email from my mom saying, \u2018No rush, but would love to know what you all might enjoy to eat on Friday night, Saturday day, Saturday night, and who is staying late on Sunday?\u2019\u201d And a 20-tab thread ensues. Associate production manager Kate Fenoglio has months of ice cream flavors planned for weekend experimenting (she loves ice cream). And senior food editor Anna Stockwell is the most Type A of all of us: She plans weekend entertaining menus and \u201cstrategic shopping\u201d the Sunday before. A full week! Anna! \u201cIt gives extra purpose, meaning, and joy to my week to have a dinner party to look forward to, so yeah, I like to spend as much time thinking about it as possible.\u201dPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiI thought long and hard about it and by Wednesday I had an idea. This weekend I\u2019m making some of the incredible recipes from Daniela Soto-Innes in our February issue: Brussels sprouts tacos with peanut butter sauce, this nutty salsa macha, avocado water I plan on spiking with tequila, and this cinnamon tamal for dessert. Variations on this menu are subject to change, and that\u2019s the fun of it. The anticipation! The possibility! The long road ahead! I might just make broccoli delight!Do you plan your weekend feasting at the start of the week? Let me know!Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Photo by Lee Lockwood/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty ImageIt\u2019s an honor just to be nominatedBecause this week two Bon App\u00e9tit articles were nominated for James Beard (pictured above) awards: Michael W. Twitty\u2019s essay about visiting, and exploring his family\u2019s roots in Ghana, and Fatima Ali\u2019s essay about how she planned to use her time when she found out her cancer was terminal. Ali passed away in January.Overheard in the Bon App\u00e9tit offices\u201cI can hear you crunch from here.\u201dPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskyAn absolute ruseSarah Jampel is one of the sweetest people I\u2019ve ever met, kind and considerate, hard-working and detail-oriented. She\u2019s also, apparently, a master of disguise. She made this make-ahead ice water salad (you should, too), for a dinner party in which one guest said he didn\u2019t like anchovies, walnuts, or garlic. The dressing for that salad is mostly anchovies, walnuts, and garlic. However, Sarah didn\u2019t tell him this, and watched as the picky eater happily devoured the crunchy salad.Unnecessary food meme of the weekLetter of the weekA LOT of readers sent in notes in response to Adam\u2019s Monday newsletter about how much we\u2019ve evolved as ~more than a magazine~ in recent years. We read them all and took your feedback to heart, except Johnny\u2019s. Here\u2019s an excerpt from one of my favorite letters, from Robin: \u201cI\u2019m a loyal subscribing reader and while-cleaning-house podcast listener. At 58, I\u2019m not just learning how to cook but follow Basically online and in the magazine. I like Healthyish\u2019s approach to sensible eating. Remember we are out here still printing off recipes and tearing out magazine pages to put in binders...If you forget your older loyal base, we\u2019ll spend more time on Cook\u2019s Illustrated. Most of us are not New Yorkers and we Midwestern and Southwestern folks cook a lot! Keep up the great effort but don\u2019t start sniffing your own farts.\u201dSpeaking of eggsYou can\u2019t make an omelet without going back-to-back with a K-pop star (as Carla did this week!), or trying 58 other ways to cook eggs (as Amiel Stanek did this week). In order to film the egg video, Amiel had to cook and eat a LOT of eggs. \u201cA month later, and I\u2019m excited about eating eggs again,\u201d he told me. \u201cHonestly, there were a few personal bests that I achieved. Had never properly poached an egg before, and it turned out perfect! Samesies with the French omelet.\u201d Good job, Amiel.MeanwhileI had no idea what olfactory neutrality wasUntil I listened to this food-themed episode of NPR\u2019s Code Switch. As all great nerdy-fun NPR podcasts do, what begins as a listener\u2019s question about eating pungent food at work (and what it implies) turns into a deep dive into a history of SMELL \ud83e\udd2f. They get into all this stuff about the rise of deodorization in public spaces (does Kroger have a distinct smell when you walk in? Not really, right?), then they go even further back to scent in ancient literature, and then BOOM, back to the present, in your cubicle, eating noodles with fish sauce. It was fascinating.Someone else\u2019s food feudThis week, a debate raged across the internet about St. Louis\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d to bagels, which is slicing them like bread. Huh. This seems like cutting a Snickers bar with a knife and fork if you ask me, but there\u2019s really only one person\u2019s whose opinion matters. And that\u2019s Claire Saffitz, bread expert AND St. Louis native. Claire, how do you feel about this? \u201cI\u2019ve literally never heard of this,\u201d she said in the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen during a break from filming [REDACTED]. \u201cYou can cut a bagel however you want. To each his own bagel! I see the merit. Bagels have become extremely bready, the dimensions have increased. Anything that gives you a better ratio of cream cheese and lox to bready interior is a good thing. But I don\u2019t support cinnamon raisin bagels as a thing.\u201dUnnecessary food feud of the weekUnwanted salami. Where did it come from? Where is it going? This week we spent half a meeting debating an etiquette question: What do you do when you\u2019ve planned an elaborate meal and a guest shows up with unsolicited, bad salami? Clearly they felt they had to bring something, so they stopped by the gas station and picked this up. Do you, control freak host, put it out with the spread or hide the salami (cough) in the fridge \u201cin case we run out later and need backup!\u201d? Emma Wartzman shook her head: \u201cI think you should put the salami on the table.\u201d Aliza Abarbanel was with her, \u201cPutting it on the table is your best chance to get rid of it!\u201d Some saw conditionals, like, say, if the person who brought it was very excited about the salami\u2014then you must put it out. If they didn\u2019t seem to care, \u201cHide it!\u201d said Chaey, and Carey Polis agreed. \u201cCan anyone who brings bad salami really call themselves a big time salami-enthusiast is the real question,\u201d posed the inquisitive Emily Schultz. Amiel beamed down for a brief second to add: \u201ccrouching host hidden salami.\u201d Molly Baz just wants to say, \u201cSalami is never unwelcome at my apt, no matter how low-qual.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d put the salami out, and let the public be the judge,\u201d said Carla diplomatically.And oh, we shall.Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecultureThe Best Etsy Stores for Hunting Vintage PyrexBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
