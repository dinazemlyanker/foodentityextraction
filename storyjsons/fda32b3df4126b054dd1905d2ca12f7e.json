It\u2019s a question the writer, performance artist, and author of Femme In Public thinks about often. \u201cSometimes things just need to get out. I have so many ideas, so much pain, so much memory that I need to do something with.\u201dThe 26-year-old gender non-conforming artist uses art to explore the raw, unedited emotions we\u2019re typically discouraged from articulating. The undertaking is equal parts intimate and cathartic, explains Vaid-Menon, and once you experience their work\u2014like, for example, a poem highlighting the transgressiveness of sporting a beard while donning fluorescent lipstick\u2014it\u2019s easy to understand why. To see and hear Vaid-Menon in their element is a tender gut-punch. They evoke a world beyond oppressive gender binaries while reminding us that, for many\u2014especially visibly queer, trans, and gender non-conforming people of color\u2014simply existing is an act of resistance with regular violence woven into their daily lives.As Vaid-Menon puts it, \u201cgender is linked to humanity,\u201d and being an artist is about life work: How does one develop new ideas and images to change this cis-heteronormative white supremacist patriarchal world? It\u2019s a process of \u201cgetting closer to the ideal but recognizing that you\u2019ll never be able to [fully reach it] and living and dwelling in that impossibility,\u201d they say. Here, the artist shares the importance of getting their feelings onto the page before bed, what they eat when feeling restless, and the ultra-helpful, albeit noisy, device that\u2019s helping them doze off.Alok's collage-filled bedroom is a reflection of their mind.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanJournaling about the dayEvery night before I go to sleep, I journal about the day. I\u2019ve been doing that now for the past six years. I have a record of every single thing that I\u2019ve done, thought, and felt, every day, for the past six years. It takes so much time, but it\u2019s some of my favorite writing because I believe in self-dialogue. How are we supposed to know what we\u2019re thinking and feeling unless we talk to ourselves and have an intimate relationship with ourselves? That helps me process the day and release.Emo-nostalgic jamsI try to listen to music before going to sleep, while working through everything I felt that day. Recently, I\u2019ve been binge-listening to singer and cellist Kelsey Lu, who is so phenomenal. And then there are of course the classics I return to. I was a very proud emo kid growing up in a small town in Texas so I have a collection of like ten really pathetic, white, angsty albums that I always default to.Hot chocolate and vegan junk foodI felt some pressure in doing this [interview]. I have so many bad habits, and I was like, am I going to be able to talk about that? I have the person I want to be, which is like, \u201cOh, I wake up at 6 a.m., and I do yoga, and I make my own breakfast, and I read a novel, and I\u2019m self-actualized.\u201d But that\u2019s not who I am or who I think anyone actually is. There\u2019s a performative quality when we talk about self-care where we glamorize ourselves as doing all these rituals that we don\u2019t actually do because developing new habits is really hard. So for me, when I\u2019m hungry at night, for instance, I eat lots of fried food, a second dinner, or a lot of ice cream. And I eat Oreos all the time. I am a total junk food vegan. If I have difficulty falling asleep, I drink hot chocolate. It\u2019s a comfort drink for me. I make a cup and try to read and that usually helps.Alok lounging in bed.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanA not-so-light massageI recently acquired this device called a TheraGun. It\u2019s basically a massage drill that beats this very hard sphere into you. It\u2019s extremely loud and looks like an intense sex toy but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s revolutionized my life. I deal with a lot of chronic pain, and I just TheraGun myself before sleeping, which I\u2019m sure annoys all of my neighbors because it sounds like I\u2019m drilling in my house. I target all of my knots and it\u2019s so painful but then I feel such relief afterwards.Farewell 2-in-1I never had long hair growing up because of gender stuff, and no one really taught me how to care for curly, long hair. But, these last few years, I\u2019ve had long hair, and I\u2019ve recently been learning how to care for it after reaching out to my Black and brown friends. I do leave-in conditioners now and use Olapex\u2019s repairing treatment and Miracle Hair Mask, and I\u2019ve learned the difference between argan oil and other oils, and I feel really geeked out about it because I didn\u2019t know all of these things about hair. I was just using 2-in-1 shampoo all the time and had really brittle, dry hair. Now my hair is so soft and buoyant and curly, and I\u2019m so proud!Sending love to friends via textI really believe in friendship as the answer to so many things. Before I go to sleep, I text like 47 people all across the world who matter to me. I just send nice notes, like \u201cI hope you had an amazing day\u201d or \u201cI really care about you\u201d or \u201cYou matter to me.\u201d I feel like the thank you note is my favorite genre of writing. I\u2019ve always loved writing thank you notes almost more than receiving gifts. It also really helps me before I\u2019m going to sleep to not feel alone. I struggle a lot with feeling isolated or lonely, but in those moments I\u2019m able to connect to these people in my life who are not just Instagram accounts I follow but people who know me and care about me.Explore Bon App\u00e9titGoing to Bed withHealthyishprofileRead MorecultureEmilia Ortiz Cleanses Her Aura and Chats with Her Ancestors Before BedBy Martine ThompsonRecipes you want to make.
