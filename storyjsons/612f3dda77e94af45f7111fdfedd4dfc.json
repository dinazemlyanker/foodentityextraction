The deeply flavored broth is made by steeping kombu, a type of dried kelp, and katsuobushi, a dried and aged tuna. When combined in water, the two transform into a savory, lip-smacking base for anything from miso soup to a barely set steamed custard. Although dashi comes together relatively quickly compared to other long-simmered broths and stocks, there\u2019s an even faster shortcut to flavorful broth, and that\u2019s instant dashi.Instant dashi is to dashi what a bouillon cube is to chicken broth. While dashi is subtle and subdued, instant dashi is a cartoon drawing with all the features enhanced and hyper-expressive. But sometimes all that noise is just what you need to liven up a dull dish. It\u2019s made from powdered bonito, which is amped up with MSG and other flavor enhancers. There is no steeping or straining required\u2014one teaspoon easily dissolves into a cup of water\u2014but to appreciate the true power of instant dashi, you should go beyond soup. I like to think of it as another spice in my arsenal, useful any time I need to add meaty depth to a recipe or just turn up the volume on flavor in any dish.The instant dashi I always reach for is produced by the Japanese company Ajinomoto, whose founder, Kikunae Ikeda, developed it to recreate the savory flavor in his wife\u2019s dashi. The company\u2019s instant dashi powder, Hon Dashi, is available at Asian markets or online.Because of its convenient powdered form, instant dashi can be sprinkled right into any number of things from scrambled eggs to popcorn. My all-time favorite way to use for instant dashi is to simply boil potatoes in it, simmering the water all the way down until I\u2019m left with a finger-licking salty dashi crust all around them.Instant dashi is also the key ingredient to these savory dinner oats, which I developed specifically to showcase this powerful powder. Someone a long time ago decided that oatmeal belonged in the breakfast category, but I think that chewy, hearty, steel-cut oats need more airtime in our lives.For my dinner oats I start by sweating scallions, garlic, and ginger in butter until tender and aromatic, before stirring in steel cut oats, water, and instant dashi. It all simmers together until the oats grow creamy and tender, creating a cozy base for any number of toppings. Here I\u2019ve kept it simple with some crispy vinegar-dressed veggies, but just like congee or polenta, savory oats are the perfect canvas for poached eggs, meaty saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, or a full fridge clean-out. And if there was still doubt about oatmeal\u2019s place at the dinner table, the instant dashi makes it clear that these oats belong there.Oats: It's what's for dinnerDashi Oats With Crunchy VegInstant dashi powder gives so much savory umami flavor to the oats that this porridge can easily be served for dinner.\u00a0View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishDinnerRead MoreLifestyleSpicy Tomato Chicken Stew Is Here to Dominate Soup SeasonBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
