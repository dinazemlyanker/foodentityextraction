First on MTV\u2019s Girl Code, where the comedian dished out hilarious, unfiltered advice about dating. Then on the based-on-her-real-life TV show Loosely, Exactly Nicole and podcast Why Won\u2019t You Date Me? about perpetual singleness. Most recently, I've been loving her as the host of Netflix\u2019s Nailed It!, a chaotic baking competition show that leans into making fun of people who are walking Pinterest fails. (Seasons 1 and 2 are streaming in full on Netflix now, with a  holiday special to come in December.)After all those years of listening to Nicole\u2019s jokes, I felt like I knew her. We\u2019re both plus-size women who love bold-printed clothes and are always trying to make people laugh. Recently, over kale-bacon salads at Ruby\u2019s Caf\u00e9 in SoHo, we talked about wearing her first bikini, her morning mirror pep talks, and how she took the power back from haters on the internet and in real life.You are so body positive and seem to not care about what anyone thinks of you. Have you always felt like this?I used to care. I was a smaller person and cared. I just woke up like three years ago and said to myself, Just wear a tank top. Wear a tube top. It\u2019s fine. Even if you\u2019re wearing a sleeve, people know your arm is fat. I decided to wear whatever the fuck I want. I don\u2019t have enough time in my life to care. I regret spending my early twenties covering my arms and wearing cardigans in the summer. I wore a bikini for the first time in Palm Springs, because I knew no one would know me there and I could say, I\u2019m very fat and very brave, which is what people looooove to say on Instagram. \u201cYou\u2019re brave.\u201d That\u2019s the hashtag I use, #veryfatverybrave, and my goal is for women to look at it and go, \u201cOh, a body is a body is a body.\u201dHow do you react if someone makes fun of you in public?If someone looks at you, that means your body\u2019s powerful. They had to stop their day to look at you. If they say something to you, that means they couldn\u2019t get through their day without saying something to you. If it\u2019s nasty, it\u2019s like whatever, but you weren\u2019t thinking about them\u2014they were thinking about you. When people are like, \"Well, you\u2019re promoting obesity,\" I say, \"No, I am promoting loving the body that you\u2019re in currently. If you want to change it, great. If you don\u2019t, then live. Live in it. Live your life. Travel, do shit, buy two seats on the plane. Who cares?\"Have you gone through periods of your life where you thought about dieting or thought about changing your habits?I\u2019ve been on Atkins, I\u2019ve done keto, and I\u2019ve done so many diets. I found out that I like to binge eat, which is the root of the problem. If you eat one hundred oranges, it defeats the purpose of eating an orange. I don\u2019t ever want to be a thin person; that seems upsetting. I don\u2019t have any plans to ever diet again, but exercising does help with life. Endorphins are real and it\u2019s annoying because I don\u2019t like to exercise. I hate running, but I started weight lifting like 150 pounds, and it's fun and it makes me feel accomplished.Since Nailed It! premiered, have you received any negativity on social media?Comedy is subjective, so if you don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s fine. There are some people who are like, \"Nicole\u2019s too much for me,\" and I\u2019m like, \"I feel you. It is exhausting being me.\" The one that bothers me is when people say I\u2019m promoting obesity or not healthy. They don\u2019t go to the doctor with me. I shouldn\u2019t have to prove my health to anybody. You think that frail, thin woman is healthier than Ashley Graham? It\u2019s the same thing as asking a married couple if they want to have kids. You don\u2019t know the ins and outs of that. You don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve been trying. You don't know their story. If I wanted to talk to you about my health, I would put it out there to talk about, but it\u2019s not something that is a part of my agenda.What\u2019s your stance on responding to the haters?I like to retweet people and then be like, \"I didn\u2019t really need your opinion, but thank you for letting me know, because obviously if you tag me in it or use my full name, you wanted me to see it.\" I search my name on Twitter because I don\u2019t want to miss the compliments, and I favorite the nice things people say about me so they know I saw it. People are more positive than they are negative, and I try not to harp on the negative. I read almost every comment I get because I\u2019m waiting for someone to tell me something I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s not one person out there that is universally liked except for maybe Mr. Rogers.Do you feel like your personal brand as someone who is body positive and confident has influenced the roles you play?I don\u2019t think my body has really come into play for anything. [On Loosely, Exactly Nicole] I did three blow job scenes, and no one was ever like, \"Nicole, are you okay in your bra?\" Everyone was like, \"What color bra? A fun one?\" Everyone was on board with that, and I got to do a lot of things my thinner counterparts do that fat women don\u2019t do unless it\u2019s part of a joke. Fat women don\u2019t fuck on television unless it\u2019s a joke, and we fuck a lot in real life. You see fat women with husbands and people and partners and wives, and they\u2019re very sexual people. That\u2019s something that should be represented. Every show doesn\u2019t have to start with two fatties meeting at an Overeaters Anonymous meeting.What has dating been like for you?If you\u2019re dating me, you know what I look like. You know my comedy, more or less. You like what you see. When I was younger, I thought guys were just chubby chasers. As I got older, I realized some men like bigger women, or some men like a personality and it\u2019s encased in a bigger woman, so that\u2019s what they like at that time. I\u2019ve just learned to not question why someone likes you. Just be happy that they do like you and enjoy the ride.What advice do you give other women, and in turn, what you wish you could have told your younger self?It took a while, but I just learned to wake up and love myself. I tell people to look in the mirror in the morning, grab their little fat handles and just go, \"Woo, baby, I\u2019m hot!\" You just fake it until you make it and one day you will wake up and you won\u2019t have to say it. You\u2019ll just feel hot.Do you have a mantra you tell yourself in the mirror?I look fucking fab, and I\u2019m not here for anybody but me. I don\u2019t get dressed for other people. I get dressed for what I see in the mirror. My body isn\u2019t for other people\u2019s consumption. If I smile when I look in the mirror, then great.
