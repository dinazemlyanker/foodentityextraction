I mean a \u201ccheese plate\u201d in the very loosest sense of the term, in that it is cheese on a plate. If I\u2019m feeling ambitious I might include a few other supporting characters to round it out and make it seem more like a meal: olives, fresh veggies, something cracker-ish. But none of these are entirely necessary. The ideal cheese is the star of the show, able to stand alone and feel not just meal-worthy but joyfully meal-worthy. When I\u2019m making an entire meal of cheese, I\u2019m all about the satisfying, earthy heft of washed rind cheeses, and more specifically, Consider Bardwell\u2019s new Dorset Mini.Washed rind cheeses are literally washed with brine (or sometimes wine, beer, or spirits) as they age, which fosters an environment hospitable to a variety of bacteria, often brevibacterium linens (b. linens). The b. linens give these cheeses their famous sticky, tangerine-colored rinds and their pungent aromas. One of the classic examples of this style, Epoisses de Bourgogne, is so potent that it\u2019s reportedly banned on Parisian public transport.Consider Bardwell\u2019s Dorset Mini is more nuanced, and I don\u2019t think anyone would sniff it out on the subway. This semi-soft Jersey cow\u2019s milk beauty is made in West Pawlet, Vermont, right on the border of New York State. It weighs in at 12 ounces, so it\u2019s not exactly tiny (the mini refers to it being a scaled down version of the original Dorset); it makes an excellent meal for two. Its pretty orange exterior yields to a paste with a pudding-like, rich texture, and its flavor is savory, almost meaty, with tons of complexity. It has enough funk to intrigue, but it doesn\u2019t hit you over the head with stinky-ness.Consider Bardwell is a longtime darling of the American artisan cheese world. In 2004, Angela Miller, a NYC literary agent and book editor for chefs like Jean-Georges Vongerichten, started the creamery along with her husband, Rust Glover, by reviving what had been a dairy co-op, founded in 1864 and shuttered during the depression. I was lucky enough to visit when I worked for Murray\u2019s Cheese in 2015. I\u2019ll never forget the green rolling hills\u2014they nearly looked fake\u2014and the kindness of the small staff. Their cheeses are made solely from fresh Jersey cow\u2019s milk from a single herd just down the road, and the milk\u2019s bright flavor shines through even in their bolder wheels like Dorset Mini.You can turn Dorset Mini into a meal with whatever\u2019s in your fridge, but I recommend pairing it with apples and honey or ribbons of jam\u00f3n and cornichons. For a special occasion, break out the Cava. You won\u2019t miss the meal you didn\u2019t cook.Photo by Emma FishmanConsider Bardwell Dorset Mini$28 at Consider Bardwell Farm$28 at Saxelby CheesemongerersExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make.
