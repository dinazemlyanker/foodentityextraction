Food Styling by Micah Morton. Prop Styling by Paige HicksEmailPinterestPrintEmailPinterestPrintMy family ate instant Japanese curry rice, or kare raisu, for dinner at least once a week when I was growing up. We always used boxes of S&B Golden Curry. I thought it was magic how the dark brown cubes inside transformed a pot of water, hearty vegetables, and chunks of stew beef into a thick velvety spicy curry in minutes. It didn\u2019t occur to me that you could make your own curry spice mix from scratch\u2014minus the preservatives and fillers\u2014until I was an adult.There are countless ways to prepare homemade kare raisu, but the one nonnegotiable for me is S&B Curry Powder, which has a blend of 17 spices and delivers the nostalgic flavor of the curry I ate as a kid. For this recipe you\u2019ll make a golden brown roux of butter and flour to which you\u2019ll add the curry powder and some garam masala; this will be your curry base that will thicken up and flavor the finished kare. I use seared mushrooms and sweet kabocha squash in this vegetarian version, but you could swap in any number of veggies and proteins, such as potatoes, turnips, daikon, and chunks of chicken or beef. \u2014Christina ChaeyAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I found more time efficient to make the roux whilst the veg was initially simmering. Can\u2019t wait to make again!Jessica New York2/11/2022Watched the cooking video for this recipe and thought, \u201cGreat!  I can finally use that curry powder I have in my cupboard!\u201d  Didn\u2019t have enough shitaake mushrooms so I adjusted the recipe accordingly.  Planning on making panko crusted beef tomorrow to add to my leftovers! Well written recipe! Heather East Orange, NJ1/8/2022LOVE the fact that I can get the same flavor of the boxed block curry that I grew up with sans the unhealthy additives & preservatives. The flavors of the curry spice mix worked well with the addition of fresh garlic, ginger, and garam masala with a hint of subtle sweetness to round out the flavors from the touch of honey. I followed the recipe exactly, but will make a few adjustments next time. I found the amount of time the vegetables were cooked to be unnecessary- especially the carrots. I found the 20 minute simmer to cause the veggies to break down so much that the veggies began disintegrating & I was missing texture in the end. Next time, I\u2019ll probably wait to add the carrots, potato/kabocha, and mushrooms to allow the base to start coming together first so I can have more control over the texture of the veggies. I grew up with green beans in my \u201ckare\u201d so I\u2019ll definitely add those next time as well. I\u2019m thinking 5-10 min with the veg would be plenty. Next time, I\u2019m thinking of making a double batch of roux & freezing a portion in these silicone molds I have (made for storing homemade baby food) to have some ready-to-go curry cubes handy. Overall great flavor & I\u2019ll definitely be making again :)Mel ELong Beach, CA1/6/2022While it did take us about 2 hrs to make in its entirety (mostly due to lack of experience with kabocha and how to prep it), it was well worth the effort. Will be making this for many fall/winters to come!LauraNashville, TN12/31/2021This turned out beautifully. Perfect flavor balance - just like a restaurant! I subbed the mushrooms and winter squash out for chicken and potatoes. Will be using this recipe again!CarmenOakland12/30/2021Good flavor but kind of gloppy texture with the rice.  By itself it works.AnonymousCalifornia12/30/2021Great recipe! Really easy and swappable. Used shiitakes and broccoli. The roux turned out to be kinda pasty (not saucy), not sure if that was the right way but it turned out good anyways! Deifnitely like that this recipe is sans all the preservatives found in the cube version.SamSingapore12/28/2021Amazing recipe! This was my first time trying a Japanese curry and could not have stumbled upon a better recipe! Full of flavour and great texture, although it did took me a while to prepare it was totally worth it. I live alone so I made half a recipe so I would have another serving for the following day, it reheats perfectly.TeresaPeru12/27/2021Excellent recipe. Loved this meal on a cold winter day. Fragrant, sweet, spicy, umami. It did take me a while to make. Maybe 1.75 hours with all the prepping. I\u2019m not a very experienced chef, but this was restaurant quality.Andy ChallengerChicago12/22/2021one of the best recipes i've made in a while! i subbed chicken stock and delicata squash bc it's what i had at home and it didn't disappoint. definitely will be making this again!kellyejdnew rochelle, ny12/15/2021this is one of the best BA recipes i\u2019ve ever made! it\u2019s a warm hug in a bowl. i followed the directions exactly and it\u2019s beyond delicious. my only substitution was using butternut squash because i couldn\u2019t find kabocha. this will be going into our regular rotation! alyssawest long branch, nj12/13/2021I used leftover dashi instead of vegetable broth. Very tasty!Chris SColorado Springs, CO 12/11/2021I made this curry with a few additives/substitutes. I did not have access to all of the mushrooms so used a variety pack and found it a great substitute. I added potato\u2019s which for next time, I will leave out. Used chicken broth vs veggie table broth and found it tasty, but once I added the roux mixture, found I needed to add .5-1 more cup of water to loosen it up. I usually use a curry cube for this type of recipe but found the homemade one in this to be exceptional. Substituted a grated apple for the honey and it was fantastic. I would recommend a cabbage salad as a side to break up the dense ness of the dish, but overall 10/10 flavor for vegetarian dish.
