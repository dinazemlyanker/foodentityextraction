I found there to be plenty of dressing, and it was a delicious dressing.AnonymousColumbia, SC1/11/2020I love this salad and have made it over and over. Makes a huge amount, which is good because its hard to stop eating this!AnonymousIndiana, USA11/19/2019Easy and giant salad. Based on everyone's comments I 1.5x'ed the dressing and added olive oil, salt, pepper, and some of the peperoncini liquid for some extra punch. This easily made 2 dinner servings and 3 leftover lunch servings. mhdsileskyAustin, TX6/24/2019Easy and versatile salad recipe, and easy to make vegetarian! Have already made multiple times.AnonymousNashville, TN5/31/2019I made this as a part recipe so I can't comment on the quantity of dressing. I poached the chicken, didn't have any peperoncini, and used sherry vinegar all of which seems to be a relatively minor deviation. We enjoyed it and will make again. It was a bit bland but it's chicken. I'd be tempted to use roasted thighs with the skins crisped, chopped, and sprinkled over.\nrigf1Chatham, ON7/16/2018Made this last night in the middle of a heat wave here and it was a refreshing and hearty salad.  As suggested by another user, I made 1.5X the dressing and that seemed to be just enough.  We sliced some avocado for the top. Next time I'll add kalamata olives too - and maybe some sliced hearts of palm? It could use a little more flavor, but we liked it a lot.  AnonymousSanta Barbara7/7/2018This was okay, not great. It was a bit bland, even after I added red onion, kalamata olives and chopped parsley. Definitely suggest you make 50% more dressing than recommended. The dressing was really good - I'd make that again.AnonymousSan Francisco7/1/2018Outstanding flavors are created with these ingredients being combined. Our teenagers, and the adults, couldn't stop having additional helpings. I will definitely be making this delicious recipe again.
