Photo by Peter TaylorPhoto by Peter TaylorFacebookTwitterEmailLiving in the South, restaurateurs Gregory and Subrina Collier had never really seen food and drink festivals that celebrated Black culture. So, about a year ago, the husband-and-wife duo behind the self-described \u201cmodern juke joint\u201d Leah & Louise, in Charlotte, North Carolina, decided to do it themselves. They\u2019re welcoming over a thousand guests at their inaugural BayHaven Food & Wine Festival, a three-day celebration of Black food and beverages this month in Charlotte.The festival is named for the neighborhoods in Memphis, where the Colliers were born. She\u2019s from Frayser, which locals nicknamed The Bay. He lived near Graceland in Whitehaven, but \u201cwe called it Blackhaven,\u201d Greg says, for its thriving African American community. The Colliers first met in a wings restaurant in Memphis, when he was a cook and she was a student. Last year, in March, they opened Leah & Louise, named after Greg\u2019s late sister and grandmother. It swiftly earned national acclaim for its contemporary interpretations of Southern classics honoring the Mississippi River valley. (I\u2019ll vouch for the Tang custard pie, topped with meringue and spiked with the \u201cspace-age\u201d orange drink that Greg enjoyed after school at his grandma\u2019s house.)Hear more from Subrina about opening Leah & Louise in the middle of the pandemic:ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.The Colliers\u2019 dedication to highlighting the richness of Black culinary traditions and advancing Black cuisine in innovative ways has led Greg to become a two-time James Beard Award semi-finalist and Subrina a 2020 James Beard Foundation Women\u2019s Entrepreneurial Leadership Fellow. We talked on a steamy afternoon outside a Charlotte coffee shop about the inspirations behind BayHaven and the importance of festivals in amplifying Black culture.This conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.Greg: We\u2019re very focused on trying to find ways to build our culture. We feel like we create spaces where Black culinarians can thrive.Subrina: In Memphis, we had an Italian fest every year and a Greek fest. I thought it was dope that they were having festivals celebrating their culture. They\u2019d be making great food, great beverages. Everybody came, Black folks, white folks. But I didn\u2019t see a lot of Black food and wine festivals or events that celebrated Black culture, especially in the South. I\u2019m creating something I didn\u2019t see.Greg: I\u2019ve always been finding spaces where I could be represented, and, as I got more representation, finding other people who were like me who weren\u2019t represented. The festival is a culmination of that. We\u2019re fortunate that we\u2019ve built a lot of great relationships with a lot of Black chefs, artisans, and farmers. We\u2019re trying to find more ways to represent our culture that isn\u2019t soul food, that isn\u2019t biscuits and gravy, or fried chicken. There\u2019s so much we do.Subrina: A lot of times, that\u2019s the only part that\u2019s highlighted. But there are different layers of Black food. So don\u2019t lump everybody in together.Greg: To cook French cuisine, there are these guidelines and specificities about how to make a b\u00e9chamel or a hollandaise. The beauty of African American cuisine, or African cuisine in the diaspora, is sweet potatoes might be cooked in different ways in each place. Same thing with yams. Same thing with rice and tomatoes and okra.Subrina: We grew up in the South calling sweet potatoes yams even though they\u2019re not the same. A lot of us don\u2019t know that. This festival gives us a chance not only for fellowship but learning. You\u2019re learning from other Black people in different regions.Greg: I don\u2019t know how Florida is the South.Subrina: [laughs]Greg: It\u2019s the way that people cook, how they put stuff together, how they use rice, what they call gravy versus what we call gravy. Being from Memphis, our Southern is a little bit different from Carolinian. Baltimore is Southern too, but it\u2019s different too.Subrina: I love the Harlem Renaissance. The festival is an ode to us during that time. In spite of the heavy discrimination of the era, we still were dressed to the nines, going out, sneaking our drinks during Prohibition.The names of all the [festival] events are based off the Harlem Renaissance, from the Cotton Club [Tasting Tents] to the Chuckwagon [Carnival]. The chuckwagons were the first food trucks. They were super popular in the 1920s. The Savoy Jazz Brunch is after the Savoy [Ballroom]. Even the Giggle Water Wine Class is based on what they used to call wine or liquor during Prohibition.Greg: We wanted to make sure we highlighted Black female chefs. If we\u2019re having discussions about Southern food, soul food, any cuisine of the South, you have to talk about Black women. I mean, all the way from slavery to the Great Migration when a lot of people moved to Detroit, Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia, [Black women] took these foodways with them.A lot of times when you think about female chefs, and Black female chefs specifically, it\u2019s easy to say, \u201cOh, pies and cakes. Oh, of course, desserts. Sweets.\u201dSubrina: They get pigeonholed into one area.Greg: Especially once you get to higher-end restaurants, there\u2019s this notion that they can\u2019t handle the line. For Black women, it\u2019s often like, \u201cShe has an attitude,\u201d although she\u2019s doing the same thing a white male counterpart may be doing. We have some chefs coming who do amazing sweets, such as Tonya Thomas. But we also have female chefs doing savory, like Whitney Thomas, Sabrina Tinsley, and Jennifer Hill Booker. It makes sense to be purposeful to find those chefs and make sure they can highlight themselves in this space.Subrina: Let me tell you, that is not the easiest when you\u2019re getting into Black wine and spirits. We\u2019re about 13 percent of the population, right? Then we go into us having access to make wine. Then there\u2019s distribution. Same thing with spirits.Greg: It\u2019s difficult to get a lot of spirits in North Carolina because of the regulations. We figured we want to get representation from the hospitality side so we got a couple of bar people who are partnering with brands coming in. We have McBride Sisters pouring, we have La F\u00eate du Ros\u00e9 pouring, we\u2019re going to have Mermosa. Lindsey [Williams] with Davidson Wine Co. is bringing some of her wines.Subrina: You\u2019re wanting to do this and you\u2019re like, \u201cThat\u2019s why it hasn\u2019t happened. It\u2019s hard as hell!\u201d It can be done. I\u2019m pleased with the people we have participating and discovering Black-owned brands.Greg: We could see more representation on every single level. So, whiskey, for instance. We need more Black farmers who can grow different types of corn. We need more distilleries, where we can distill the different types of corn that we grow. We need more retail representation to get the distilled product on the shelves. Even with that, we need more representation at state levels to try to help us gain access into places that are good ol\u2019 boys\u2019 clubs still.Subrina: Hopefully our festival sparks a conversation.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsInterviewsRecipes you want to make.
