I\u2019m in favor of anything that encourages more people to cook at home, and the produce that people put in their own shopping carts is none of my business and none of my concern.Personally, I can\u2019t justify buying produce that\u2019s been robbed of its natural wrapper, exposed to air, and rewrapped in plastic. Yes, I am specifically talking about summer corn that\u2019s had its ends trimmed and a peekaboo window of the husk peeled off. (Sure, you\u2019ve saved some time but at what cost?) But I am also speaking more generally of the farm-to-plastic-wrapper-to-table pipeline. I find that pre-prepped produce isn\u2019t as tasty\u2014you can\u2019t un-oxidize something once it\u2019s exposed to air. And all that unnecessary packaging! Plus, it\u2019s more expensive. It\u2019s just not for me. Unless we\u2019re talking about butternut squash.Sure I can break down a butternut squash the safe way. But also\u2026why? Prepping a butternut squash is only satisfying in that doing so without losing an appendage feels like a win. And since I\u2019m invariably going to be roasting the squash anyway, the time it spends naked and cubed in plastic doesn\u2019t matter to me. Plus, there are so many great butternut squash recipes that become really easy butternut squash recipes when the prep is done for you.Now and then, sure\u2014I\u2019ll take the long route. I\u2019ll roll the dice, use a very sharp knife, and peel and cube the squash myself. But most of the time? It\u2019s Tuesday, I\u2019m tired, I\u2019ve had a hard day, and I\u2019m just trying to make soup ASAP. When I see someone at the store with the cubed butternut squash in their cart, I know they\u2019re probably feeling the same way, and I give them a knowing nod of solidarity.And with that squash:Vegan Butternut Squash SoupIf you've always thought you needed hours to make a luxuriously silky pur\u00e9ed vegetable soup, well, this recipe is here to say you don't!\u00a0View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titSquashRecipes you want to make.
