I am surprised to see several reviewers saying the meatballs are dry, since that hasn't been my experience at all. The slightly sweet, aromatic hoisin sauce makes minced turkey into something special. I've made these several times and have served them with glass noodles as outlined here, with rice, on top of salad, and in a sort of bahn mi style sandwich. Definitely recommend.Sadie BeeQueens, NY3/6/2021I agree with a lot of the other reviewers. These meatballs were a bit dry--but pleasantly soft. I think it's the high volume of quinoa? I also wanted a bit more sauce on the noodles. RebeccaDenver, CO12/4/2020I read the reviews below ahead of cooking and I solved the dryness issue of the meatballs by adding an egg to the mince. I also did 5tbsp hoisin instead of 3. As for the sauce I basically made double the amount and it turned out great. Hubby loved it.Mel AplinAustralia5/31/2020Awful recipe. Dry mealy meatballs. Sauce was tasty, but not nearly enough to coat all of the ingredients. Ending up tossing it.AnonymousSeattle5/25/2020This was more work than I expected, but surprisingly good!  I did read the reviews so added some chopped onion and shredded carrot to the meatballs.  I also added some vegetables and the other half of the onion to the stir fried noodles.  I would definitely make it again!AnonymousBoston4/2/2019The meatballs were tasty and light, with the quinoa.  The noodles were packed with vegetables.  Couldn't find glass noodles so substituted thin rice noodles.  The noodle sauce could have used a little more soy, though not sure whether this is because of the rice noodle substitution.  Very healthy, and both kids loved it and want it again-- a win for everyone.AnonymousPhiladelphia area4/1/2019I work as a cook at a boarding school, meaning I cook meals for 20-ish extremely picky preteen girls every day - I tried this recipe out today and they ALL loved these meatballs. The quinoa really helped keep the turkey moist and light, but texture-wise they had no idea they were eating quinoa! This will definitely be in my regular meal planning rotation from now on!1/8/2019The meatballs were somehow flavorless despite all the strong flavors in them. The texture was also off. i think the quinoa was to blame. The noodles were okay but I'm not going to to be making this again. Erika SBoston8/19/2018SO DELICIOUS! Really simple to make and didn't require any crazy ingredients. Only thing I would do differently is use a little more veggies and less noodles. The noodles are delicious but theres way too many of them. I would also say this server 6 as opposed to 4! So yummy and will definitely make again.AnonymousBoston, MA8/14/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titMeatballQuinoaRice & GrainsSugar Snap PeaPeaVegetableZucchiniSquashTurkeyPoultryGlass NoodleNoodlePasta & NoodlesEasyWeeknight MealsMainDairy-FreeHealthyishLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
