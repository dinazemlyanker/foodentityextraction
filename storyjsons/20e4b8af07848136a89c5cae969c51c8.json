If So, Make ThisA new stew recipe and more highlights\u2014and lowlights, honestly\u2014from the week at BA.By Alex BeggsFebruary 9, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesFacebookTwitterEmailMake thisAre you in a snow day state? Or just experiencing the season of \u201cwinter\u201d? Whether you\u2019re happy to miss work or going stir crazy with potty-training toddlers that demand your every ounce of potty patience (Hi Sarah!), I have the perfect snow day recipe for ya. This Andy Baraghani Signature\u2122 lamb tagine can be made in a Dutch oven, and it will make your entire home smell incredible\u2014lamb, cumin, garlic, but also raisins and cinnamon. It\u2019s savory and a little sweet, and the only work you need to do is brown the lamb properly before adding everything else in. It\u2019s even better with a side of Andy\u2019s crispy baked rice, tachin.Get the recipe: Spiced Lamb TagineMa\u2019am, what\u2019s in the bagI was in Peru recently (!) and brought back a duffel bag full of treats: freshly roasted coffee from Three Monkeys and Neira Caf\u00e9 Lab, crunchy cacao nibs, three bags of popped kiwicha (a grain smaller than quinoa), bags of different colored quinoa, purple corn meal I have no idea what to do with yet, choclo (the big corn), and chulpe (long corn kernels to pop and make the best beer-drinking snack with). At customs at 3 a.m., the agent asked me what I\u2019d brought home with me. \u201cFood!\u201d I said. \u201cWhat kind?\u201d \u201cQuinoa.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cA kind of cereal?\u201d And he waved me on my way.Amiel\u2019s head in Jell-OThis week we learned that Basically editor Amiel Stanek has seen Blue Man Group three times, which, if you know Amiel, makes complete sense. Once he was even chosen to be the guy pulled on stage, where the Blue Men dug out his head from inside a block of orange-colored Jell-O. Wow.Sometimes dinner isn\u2019t that goodWhile avoiding writing magazine text that\u2019s on a strict deadline, editor in chief Adam Rapoport likes to roam the office and sit in staffer\u2019s vacant chairs, tapping on his laptop as if every key is stuck with honey. I \u2019 M  R E A L L Y  W O R K I N G is what the tap tap tap sounds like to me. Sometimes he\u2019ll sit behind me and I imagine it must be hard to share a chair with Harvey, the giant pooka who normally sits there. This week we discussed when dinner isn\u2019t that good. You\u2019d think people who work at a food magazine are always making these gourmet dinners with the proper serving side of vegetables, but really they don\u2019t. Adam had a disappointing, watery pot pie from a grocery store freezer aisle. Alex Delany chimed in that he\u2019d saut\u00e9ed up some mushrooms, garlic, cherry tomatoes, and kale\u2014\u201cit was aggressively mediocre,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI ate leftover super bowl onion dip with stale chips and baby carrots for dinner on Tuesday,\u201d sighed Hilary Cadigan. Sounds pretty good actually. \u201cI bought a frozen salmon in a single-serving package with a little spice pack and it didn't fully defrost,\u201d said Amanda Shapiro. \u201cBut I ate it anyway.\u201dUnnecessary food meme of the weekWow, that\u2019s a lot of likesElyse Inamine was in L.A. recently and had to stop by Konbi, the trendy Japanese restaurant whose egg salad sando is the 2019 version of a Roberta\u2019s pizza: Instagram GOLD. Sure enough, her pic of the symmetrical yolk-centric sandwich racked up nearly 800 comments from readers ooing and aahing. \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with this sandwich?\u201d I asked Elyse. She leaned back in her chair and sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s sooo gewwwwd.\u201d But really, explain this to me. \u201cIt\u2019s squishy, yolky, and a little mustardy, all the things you want in an egg salad sando. I drove in the torrential downpour TWICE to get it.\u201d Wow. \u201cBut one of the comments was about how my thumb looks gross. That hurt.\u201dUnnecessary food feud of the weekIn a meeting about kitchen tools, a startling revelation about who believes in salad spinners, and who doesn\u2019t, caused staffers to yell and pound the conference room table. I\u2019d never before seen a look of horror like the one that passed over Sarah Jampel\u2019s face when she heard that so many people don\u2019t use them. At least five people raised their hands proudly to announce their anti-spin stance. \u201cDO YOU LIKE WET SALAD?\u201d asked an exasperated Amiel. Julia Kramer insisted she \u201chates water on lettuce\u201d but washes her greens ahead of time, leaves them on towels to dry, and has perfectly dry lettuce. \u201cI don\u2019t even clean it and I\u2019m here to tell the tale,\u201d said Emily Schultz with the blind confidence of someone with undiagnosed E. coli. \u201cThe spinner gets dirt off in such a satisfying way,\u201d pleaded Amanda Shapiro. \u201cIt\u2019s never dry,\u201d whispered Julia from across the room. \u201cI don\u2019t own one, but I believe in them,\u201d said diplomatic Aliza Abarbanel, who admitted she \u201cnever knows what to do with the dirt\u201d on the bottom of the bowl she uses to wash. \u201cYou know what you do, you USE A SALAD SPINNER!\u201d said Amiel, rising out of his chair in anguish. \u201cYou have a colander?\u201d said anti-spinner Carey Polis, her voice getting higher and higher pitched, \u201cwash the lettuce in there!\u201d The discussion derailed to herbs and what really needs to be washed, and everyone found common ground on one thing: ALWAYS WASH LEEKS.Etiquette questions?Do you have any food-related travel questions for me?
