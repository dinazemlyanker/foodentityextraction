Its luxurious richness adds depth to proteins, like the catfish in this recipe from Nicole A. Taylor, featured in Bryant Terry\u2019s book Black Food. You can swap the benne seeds with sesame seeds and maple sugar with light brown sugar, depending on what you have on hand. Instead of catfish, feel free to use any skinless white-fleshed fish fillet.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

If I were to do it again, I would substitute fennel seeds.  I  tried putting the fish (cod) on top of the orange slices, but that kept the fish from contacting the hot baking sheet and resulted in uneven cooking.  Won't do that again.  For me, there are better preparations of white fish chunk filets.ColoBillDenver, CO1/12/2022interesting flvors but way too salty, used Diamond kosher salt and woud cut in half next rime.  Made this with the sweet potato grits and the bitter greens salad.  Would also maybe try and char the ornages a little befor cooking to lend a tad more roasted ornage flavor.AnonymousCharlotte11/16/2021My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe.  Used Catfish.  Instead of baking, we grilled it on a piece of foil, grilled for 8 minutes.\nWill Definitely make again.  Served with rice and a carrot salad.  After slicing the orange, used the rest to serve over the rice.DDSmithLodi, CA9/8/2021Not very good. Cocoa did not mesh well with the other flavors and made the whole thing seem muddy. Combined with the natural oiliness of the catfish the dish came out nauseating. Also, I expected some type of crust to form from the seeds and spices while it baked, but it never happened because of the orange on top. Cooking times are way off too. My filets needed closer to 20 minutes.  I\u2019ll probably fry the leftover filets to redeem it.\n\nIf I were to do this again, I would skip the orange slices, incorporate orange zest in the rub, half the amount of cocoa, double the sesame and caraway seed, and use anything besides catfish. Would probably skip baking and pan fry the fish too.Swarthy N SwoleAustin, TX8/19/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titSouthernAmericanAfricanSoul FoodCocoaOther IngredientsOrangeCitrusFruitFishSeafoodQuickEasySheet-Pan DinnersWeeknight MealsMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeRoastDinnerRecipes you want to make.
