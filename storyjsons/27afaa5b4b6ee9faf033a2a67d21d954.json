Chef Daniel Rose served this flavor-packed entr\u00e9e at our Paris in New York dinner.PrintIngredients1 duck breast, with fat cap attached\u2154 cup brewed and cooled Nespresso Master Origin Colombia coffee\u2153 cup Armagnac12 prunes, pitted1 strip lemon peel1 whole clove1 bay leaf1 bunch thyme2 cinnamon sticks6 peppercorns1 garlic cloveRecipe PreparationScore the fat on the duck in a crosshatch pattern, being careful to only cut through the fat and not the meat.Put the duck breast, prunes, spices, Nespresso coffee, and Armagnac into a plastic re-sealable bag and refrigerate for up to 24 hours, turning occasionally to make sure duck marinates evenly. Remove the duck breast, pat very dry. Place the duck fat side up on a tray and transfer to refrigerator to chill and dry out for 24 hours.Remove the duck and set aside. Strain out the spices and prunes, saving the marinating liquid. Combine the prunes and the marinade in a small sauce pan and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 3-4 minutes until the liquid is syrupy and coats the prunes.Season the duck breast with salt and pepper. Lay fat side down in a cold pan and bring to medium heat. Once nicely colored and a lot of the fat has rendered out, turn the breast over and cook for 2-3 minutes. Remove the breast from the heat and leave to rest before slicing and serving with the warm prunes.Recipe by chef Daniel RoseSponsored by NespressoGET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for the Bon App\u00e9titNewsletterSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyExplore Bon App\u00e9titSponsoredMore from Bon App\u00e9titRecipes6 Pro Chefs Reveal Their \"Secret Weapon\" Ingredients2022-03-02T17:00:00.000ZrecipePorcini Gnocchi With Butter Sauce2022-03-15T09:00:00.000ZrecipeWhiskey Sour2020-12-16T18:20:00.000ZBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
