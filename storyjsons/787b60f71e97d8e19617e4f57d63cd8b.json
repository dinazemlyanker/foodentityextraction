Same texture, same flavor...but extra extra, just like me.\u201d Duck fat is delicious, but lard is cheaper and easier to find. Of course, if you happen to have duck fat lying around, feel free to use it. Just make sure to strain and use the fat left over from the cooked duck legs to make tortillas, roasted potatoes, or empanadas.IngredientsMakes 12Duck4duck legs (thigh and drumstick; about 3\u00bd lb. total)6Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 3 Tbsp.

Rub legs with salt, working into flesh and skin. Transfer to a medium bowl or airtight container. Cover and chill at least 12 hours and up to 1 day.Step 2Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 250\u00b0. Heat lard in a large saucepan over medium-high until an instant-read thermometer registers 250\u00b0.Step 3Scatter chiles, bay leaf, cinnamon stick, cloves, achiote seeds, peppercorns, and oregano across the bottom of a large baking dish. Remove duck legs from bowl and brush off excess salt. Arrange legs, skin side down, over aromatics in baking dish. Nestle orange and garlic around legs, then pour warm lard over. Cover baking dish tightly with foil and bake legs 2 hours.Step 4Turn duck legs skin side up and nestle back into fat. Re-cover dish and continue to bake until meat is very tender and begins to pull away from the bones, 2\u20132\u00bd hours longer.Step 5Let duck legs sit in fat until cool enough to handle (30\u201340 minutes), then transfer to a plate. Reserve 3 Tbsp. fat for frying duck skin and strain remaining fat through a fine-mesh sieve into an airtight container and let cool. Cover and reserve for another use (see recipe intro for ideas!).Step 6Remove skin from legs and set aside. Pull meat from bones, tearing into 1\" pieces; discard bones and cartilage. Heat reserved 3 Tbsp. fat in a large nonstick skillet over medium and cook reserved duck skin, turning halfway through, until deep golden brown and crisp on both sides, 12\u201315 minutes total. Transfer chicharrones to paper towels to drain and let cool 5 minutes; crumble into small pieces.Step 7Do Ahead: Duck legs can be baked 3 weeks ahead. Transfer whole legs to a large nonreactive container; strain fat through a fine-mesh sieve over meat. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before removing skin and shredding meat.Escab\u00e8che and AssemblyStep 8Whisk lime juice, honey, and salt in a medium bowl until salt and honey are dissolved. Add radishes, onion, mint, tarragon, and 1 chile and toss to coat. Add remaining chiles as desired (depending on their heat and how spicy you like things).Step 9Top warm tortillas with some reserved meat, then radish escab\u00e8che and reserved chicharrones.How would you rate Duck Carnitas Tacos With Radish Escab\u00e8che?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (10)Back to TopTriangleMade these several month ago... Fantastic!!SteveSt Petersburg, FL1/9/2022I live part of the year in the southwest of France where duck is easily available as well as duck lard. On the other hand the chiles and annatto are not so easily found. I tweeked the recipe a bit as far as the aromatics. It was amazing! The meat cooks slowly in the lard and becomes very tender. We liked the escabeche a lot. I served it with cilantro lime rice and white beans cooked in duck lard which is a specialty here. I had guests and everyone enjoyed it. I will be doing this again and again! Thanks Rick!AnonymousSouthwest of France and Miami.10/4/2021We made this with older Muscovy duck legs and wings, and home made Mangalitsa pig lard...and it was absolutely fabulous!  We doubled the meat, but used the amount of lard in the recipe so top layer was chewy, but so delicious. We found the morita chilis and beautiful cinnamon at our local Latin American store.  This recipe is a keeper!StoneMeadowjcWATERLOO, ON2/22/2021This. Is. Amazing. I made the duck confit with just the standard bay leaves, garlic and thyme and this was still to die for. Everything, every texture, every flavor was a delight. One of the best meals i have ever made at home.AnonymousNorth Carolina1/2/2021Can you use duck breast to make this instead? Selena North Dakota 12/3/2020Awesome recipe. One of my favorite things I've ever cooked from BA. I highly recommend broiling the meat after you take it off the bone. I did 10 mins in my air fryer (broiler setting) and it crisped up beautifully. Such great textures and flavors in this dish!AnonymousLos Angeles6/22/2020What a treat! This recipe looked like a lot of work at first read, but most of it is really just waiting for the oven to do the magic. It's the first time I cooked duck and it turned out perfect \u2013 not dry, well flavoured and seasoned. I misread and only bought half the lard (250g) but it still turned out fine, and also had to improvise with missing spices (ancho chili flakes instead of whole morita, nutmeg instead of achiote) and it was still great.\n\nThanks Rick!AnonymousUK5/26/2020@BUCKSHOT49: Yes, the duck (or chicken) will last for three weeks in the fridge--as long as it's completely covered by the fat and not disturbed (I mean, not removed from fat and then put back in). Confit is a way people used to preserve meat before refrigeration. civilizationinruinsChicago5/24/2020Clarify please: Do Ahead section says cover and chill up to three weeks ahead.  Does duck really last that long in the fridge?\n(Making this tonight using chicken; smells great so far!Buckshot49Washington3/27/2020Made these last weekend \u2014 they were delicious! Don't skimp on the duck skin chicharrones. They are delicious, and they help make up for the lack of cripy bits on the duck. To help with the lack of crispiness factor, we did consider sticking the shredded duck under the broiler or sauteeing the shredded meat in some fat on the stovetop, BUT we ultimately decided to stick to the recipe because we were hungry and worried about drying out the duck. Curious to know what others thought about the texture! Overall, super delicious tacos. Highly recommend.AnonymousChicago3/11/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titTacoDuckPoultryRadishVegetableMainDairy-FreeNut-FreeDinnerRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
