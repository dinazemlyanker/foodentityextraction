(Okay, five other reasons, but still.)By Emma WartzmanAugust 9, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie CraigFacebookTwitterEmailWhen I was little I had a set of Russian nesting dolls that I would stack and unstack with all the care in the world, truly delighted by how perfectly they fit together. Now, at the ripe age of 26, I have a set of nesting stainless steel mixing bowls that I am equally, if not more, delighted by.Is it lame to take so much pleasure in such a simple, mundane set of kitchen equipment? Maybe. But not a day goes by that I don't pull out at least one of my six stainless steal nesting bowls. (Okay, maybe a day, but you get the idea.) The largest is perfect for tossing a giant grain salad that I can eat throughout the week. The mid-sized ones are just right for mixing together dry ingredients when I bake. Smaller ones are there for me when I\u2019m whisking together a dressing of some kind. And the tiniest bowls are perfect for prepping out smaller quantities of ingredients like grated garlic, ginger, or dried spices.The thing is, not only are these bowls workhorses in the kitchen, but they're also an indispensable part of any dinner party I throw. Someday I hope to own a dazzling array of beautiful serving bowls that I can feel proud to bring to the table, but at this point I supplement my small supply of aesthetically-pleasing ceramics with these stainless steel vessels. (I like to think of them as \"industrial chic.\") Whether it\u2019s a big green salad at the center of the table, or a few dips laid out as appetizers, these bowls are there for me.Plenty of room to toss, toss, toss those lettuces.\nTED CAVANAUGHMy reasons for delighting in them don\u2019t stop there, though. In my Brooklyn apartment, space is a hot commodity, so their nesting ability straight-up rules. Imagine! SIX bowls in the space of one! They are unbreakable, which I know because I have dropped them more times than I can count, and they can go straight into the dishwasher and come out as shiny and new-looking as they day I bought them (or, if you don\u2019t have a dishwasher, they are truly the easiest to clean by hand). A whole set of costs a painless $25 on Amazon, which is as much as I know you would spend on a few drinks out on Saturday night, or a mani/pedi, or a refill on your bus pass. And they last a hell of a lot longer than any of those things.Convinced yet? Good.
