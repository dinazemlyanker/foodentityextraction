It just means the sugars in the glaze are caramelizing (not that the meat is burning), resulting in deep, complex flavor. Try this glaze on shrimp, whole fish, chicken breasts, slab bacon, or beef skewers.Ingredients4 servingsVegetable oil (for grill)\u00bdcup pineapple juice (from a can)\u00bccup honey\u00bccup unseasoned rice vinegar3Tbsp.
