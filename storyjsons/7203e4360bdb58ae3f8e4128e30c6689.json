Mahi-mahi fillets get a heavy brushstroke of good Dijon mustard before roasting for 10 minutes\u2014which is how much time you\u2019ll need to throw together the salad. Feel free to swap out the mahi-mahi for halibut, salmon, or your favorite fish fillet.Ingredients4 Servings46-oz. skinless, boneless mahi-mahi fillets, patted dry2Tbsp. plus \u00bc cup extra-virgin olive oil, dividedKosher salt, freshly ground pepper1Tbsp. plus 2 tsp.

I used butter lettuce (we just like it better), and actually roasted the asparagus along with the mahi.  It was so delicious and a fast, easy fix!!  Will DEF be making it again!!  JillianJacksonville, FL2/23/2022Wow just discovered my new fav way to make asparagus, so simple and tasty. I used what fish was fresh at my market which was salmon and it came out perfect! Also such a good and quick salad dressing to whip up for future salads. So glad I found this recipe!DomLos angeles6/10/2021Great recipe! Very easy! Would make a good weeknight meal! Thanks BA!Nathan koenegsteinJackson, tn6/8/2021Really, really good. I made it with sockeye salmon pieces and did all the cooking on an outside grill (early June heatwave...stove/oven forbidden). Served with a baguette and some special olive oil alongside. Satisfying. This will be in summer rotation with the fish of the moment.\n\nAnonymousCanada6/4/2021This was super great! Impressed with how all the flavors came together, with not one overpowering the other. Couldn't find mahi mahi at the store, so substituted with tilapia and it was delicious. Really light and healthy dinner that fills you up. Was super easy to prep for and cook. LizzieMonterey, CA6/3/2021I have made this several times with different fish - Barramundi is especially good! So simple and so delicious, this is one of my go-to's when I want a quick and healthy meal.elcoverWilmington, DE5/17/2021This recipe is amazing! I hardly ever cook halibut but it came out perfect using this recipe.I used a large spoon and pushed on each fillet to test for done-ness (learned from another BA recipe). I am also on a GERD restricted diet so lemon was out and instead, for the dressing, I replaced with a dry white wine and  went without lemon on the fish and it was still so flavorful. Thanks for a great dinner!Lees-Lees V.Phoenix, AZ4/25/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladMahi-MahiFishSeafoodAsparagusVegetableAvocadoArugulaLeafy GreensSpringQuickEasyWeeknight MealsMainGluten-FreeKetoHealthyishDinnerRecipes you want to make.
