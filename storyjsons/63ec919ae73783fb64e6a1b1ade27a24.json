We have a few hours before Annie takes their spot behind the bar at the beloved Macanese restaurant Fat Rice, and the city\u2019s brilliant cocktail sorcerer is visibly enamored.Freaky plant energy is part of the whole cocktail ethos at Fat Rice and its adjacent bar The Ladies\u2019 Room, where Annie\u2014who is gender fluid and uses the plural pronouns they/them\u2014runs both the beverage program and front of house. The first drink of theirs that I ever tried tasted like acid rainwater and came garnished with a wayward ramp stem leaning out of a double rocks glass. Sort of like a well-tailored suit in a wild color, Annie\u2019s cocktails are surprising and unexpected. They use ingredients like avocado leaf tincture and salted coconut foam; umeboshi vinegar and jerk spices. They play with texture, salt, and umami. They\u2019re silky, creamy, salty, and foamy. They are some of the most boundary-defying drinks in a city celebrated for its bars.Annie Beebe-Tron at the bar at Fat Rice.\nPhoto by David KasnicFat Rice is the first and only restaurant that Annie has ever worked in\u2014if we don\u2019t count their undergrad cafeteria (\u201cyou shouldn\u2019t,\u201d they joke). They taught themself how to bartend on the job and revisited basic chemistry to develop their own liqueurs, infusions, and Chartreuses, which coat the tongue in a savory oil slick and blow wide open what was even available for mixing cocktails. Annie is accustomed to learning like this; they were homeschooled as a child (under a Christian evangelical doctrine) and grew up an \u201cindoor kid\u201d with a bent for plants, and later for art.\u201cI figured out midway through my art career that I wasn\u2019t a visual person, but a kinesthetic person\u2014a texture person,\u201d Annie says of their stint making art with food themes. The art of the cocktail, we\u2019ll say, let them meet in the middle.Governed by a tactile approach, Annie\u2019s menu prioritizes the active experience of swirling a garnish or adjusting the flavor yourself. The Saigon Street Breakfast, made with ingredients including Thai basil, lime, and a housemade pho vermouth, is an ideal show of their ethos: \u201cI wanted that experience you get when you\u2019re drinking pho\u2014the temperature changes and the dilution changes. It\u2019s all fluctuating as you\u2019re drinking it.\u201dSome of Annie\u2019s projects.\nPhoto by David KasnicA close up.\nPhoto by David KasnicStraining... something.\nPhoto by David KasnicTheir drinks are also a testament to their role as devoted collaborator and steadfast leader at Fat Rice\u2014a job Annie has excelled at as a queer feminist boss seeking to upend the traditional hierarchy. Co-owner Adrienne Lo\u2019s mother is growing ingredients for a house absinthe. A Romanian janitor\u2019s plum liqueur recipe features in the Onu You Didn\u2019t cocktail. The backbar hosts bottles of cardoon amaro, a creation Annie was able to salvage from one of chef Abe Conlon\u2019s infusion experiments gone wrong. It\u2019s just one of many projects Annie tends to with a gardener\u2019s patience\u2014there are currently an estimated 150 bottles (and \u201clots more to go\u201d) brewing and infusing in their personal \u201cvault.\u201dAs we walk through the conservatory, we pick out which of the freaky plants would make the best garnishes. There\u2019s a furry velvet-looking one and the iridescent rainbow spiky one and the medium-leafed, glossy, proud, type A looking one. I watch Annie\u2019s excitement builds as their attention darts from species to species. Each and every detail noticed; everything eyed for its potential.A view inside The Ladies\u2019 Room bar.\nPhoto by David KasnicExplore Bon App\u00e9titChicagoBarsRestaurantsRecipes you want to make.
