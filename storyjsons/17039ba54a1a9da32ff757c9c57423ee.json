When something\u2019s so easy you don\u2019t need one. In It\u2019s That Simple, we talk you through the dishes we make with our eyes closed. Today, uttapam pancakes.While I love a thick, fluffy stack of pancakes with syrup dripping down the sides, for me the ultimate nostalgia comes from uttapam-inspired pancakes. Unlike traditional uttapam, a Tamilian and South Indian staple that has a batter of rice and lentils that\u2019s often fermented for hours, these are made from store-bought pancake mix and buttermilk\u2014my mom\u2019s time-saving solution.When I was growing up, she would make these as part of our weekend breakfast rotation. I loved watching the ghee slip and slide in the hot pan as she\u2019d ladle out the batter and add red onions, vibrantly green cilantro, tomatoes, and red or green chile as the pancake began to brown around the edges and little air bubbles emerged on the surface. From there, it was a race to get as many of the toppings on before it was time to flip. She\u2019d hover patiently until the onions caramelized on the bottom, then deliver the pancakes directly from the stove to whoever\u2019s plate was empty.Syrup and butter are to sweet pancakes what podi (which translates to powder) and chutney are to these savory ones. It\u2019s all about the condiments for dipping. I\u2019d mimic my dad by making a small mound of podi, made from ground dal and hot chile and often nicknamed gunpowder, and then forming a well to fill with gingelly (sesame) oil. He\u2019d then mix the two together, like you would mix eggs into flour for pasta dough. We\u2019d tear off a piece of pancake and dip it in the mixture for the perfect bite of onion, masala, and tomato.Now, these pancakes are my go-to whenever I\u2019m missing those days of sitting around our dining table with family but didn\u2019t plan ahead enough to make the traditional fermented batter. And they\u2019re always accompanied by a mound of podi and gingelly oil or zingy green chutney.Here\u2019s how to make uttapam-inspired pancakes:Make pancake mix, like Bisquick, according to the package instructions, but use buttermilk in place of milk for characteristic tanginess. Add 1 tsp. salt. Heat a griddle or nonstick skillet on medium heat and use a pastry brush to add enough ghee to the pan just to coat the whole surface. Ladle in the batter so that you have about 6\"-diameter pancakes. Add about 1 tsp. each chopped red onion, chile, cilantro, and tomato. Once you see air bubbles forming and the sides are golden brown, carefully flip. Allow onions to caramelize and brown, about 1\u20132 minutes, before taking it off the heat.For me this isn\u2019t complete without the condiments. My favorites are a green, herby chutney (like store-bought or homemade mint or cilantro chutney) and podi with gingelly oil. You can find it at your local Indian grocer, or order online from companies like Podi Life\u2014my favorite is their crunchy peanut variety. I mound the podi on my plate and create a little well for the sesame oil, then combine them with my fingers. Alternate between the podi and the chutney for a satisfying breakfast. \u00a0While these pancakes may not be dead ringers for traditional uttapam, on a groggy morning, they\u2019re just close enough.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimplecookingPancakeRecipes you want to make.
