A dipping sauce of fish sauce, lime juice, chile, garlic, and sugar, it varies across Vietnam; some are sweeter, some more savory. This one is less potent than the average and creamy thanks to toasted, buttery cashews. It clings to whatever you\u2019re dressing. Here that\u2019s snow peas, but you can also use it on salads, rice, eggs, or simple stir-fried greens.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.
