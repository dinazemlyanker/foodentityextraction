All of them are delicious, but I\u2019m telling you to order the waffles. These are not just any waffles. They\u2019re savory sourdough waffles, born from a 27-year-old starter that the city\u2019s crowned Queen of Fine Dining, Anne Quatrano, created at her first restaurant, Bacchanalia.Back then, starters were made by coaxing the yeast off the skin of organic grapes (yeah, for real), so you know this thing is no joke. It\u2019s traveled with Quatrano through more than half a dozen restaurants\u2014not to mention Bacchanalia\u2019s multiple relocations\u2014and spawned countless boules. (It\u2019s even spent holidays and closures at various staffers\u2019 homes, so someone could look after it.)The waffle recipe that makes this starter sing dates back to 1998, when Quatrano and her husband Clifford Harrison opened Floataway Cafe, a bright little French-Italian bistro inside an old warehouse. It came off the menu three years later when Floataway\u2019s brunch got 86\u2019ed (nobody likes working brunch), but Quatrano says loyal customers from the old days light up when they order Pancake Social\u2019s iteration: a crisp, slightly tangy delight served hot and hissing under a splotch of melty butter. Pair it with eggs to stay savory or apply the requisite maple syrup bath for a hits-the-spot study in sweet-toasty contrast.Long live the Queen.Go there: Pancake SocialExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendAtlantaRestaurantsRead MorerestaurantsI Hate Brunch, But I Love Root Baking Co.By Hilary CadiganRecipes you want to make.
