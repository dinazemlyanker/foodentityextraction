And when I got on the plane for the return flight home, there was no doubt in my mind where I\u2019d eaten the most delicious food: at the Lodge, a neighborhood tavern in Oakland that reminds me of the places I\u2019d hang out at in Chicago\u2014but that are increasingly difficult to find in New York and S.F. A place with non-ironic antler heads, a popcorn machine, and a tiny kitchen that plays host to pop-ups, such as, on the night I visited, one called Lovely\u2019s, run by the chef Mikey Yoon. Here I ate the most flawless diner-style burger I\u2019ve had in recent memory, and that\u2019s coming from someone who has eaten many diner-style burgers in her lifetime. I had to know what Yoon was doing back there in that closet-size kitchen to make an even more special sauce, so I jumped on the phone with him to get the details.The genius behind the burgers, chef Mikey Yoon.\nPhoto by Brian MolyneauxThe Beef\u201cI wanted to tackle a classic five- or six-dollar burger. I grind the meat every day. Because I\u2019m doing a thinner-style patty, I need more fat, and I get that from using a ratio of about 70-to-30 chuck roll to brisket.\u201dThe Technique\u201cThis is a very Midwest-style griddle burger, so I smash the patty, making sure I get a good crust. From there I salt and flip it, and that\u2019s when the onions go on. I call them glitter magic onions because I glitter the beef with my onions.\u201dThe Cheese\u201cIt\u2019s just cheap American cheese.\u201dThe Bun\u201cI\u2019m from Maryland, so Martin\u2019s are the buns I grew up with. Back then you would only find them in certain places on the East Coast! I toast them in beef fat on the plancha.\u201dThe Toppings\u201cI get Early Girl tomatoes from the farmers\u2019 market when they\u2019re in season, but the lettuce is always shredded iceberg, which is important for that crunch. Then I add two County Fair pickle slices: They do the job well and have a nice tang.\u201dThe Sauce\u201cI make homemade mayo that\u2019s kind of a riff on Edna Lewis\u2019 recipe, which is super Southern style. I want the richness of the Hellmann\u2019s or Duke\u2019s that I loved as a kid. I combine that with ketchup, mustard, and other seasonings for the burger sauce.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titOaklandBurgersDish DecodedRead MorecultureI Instagram-Stalked This Croissant, So I Found Out How It\u2019s MadeBy Rachel KartenrestaurantsTurkey Tails Are The Most Delicious Thing You Didn\u2019t Even Know You Could EatBy Elyse InamineRecipes you want to make.
