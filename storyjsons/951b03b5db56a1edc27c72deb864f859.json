It does require a good blender because of the solid spices.  I tried blending it in a food processor because I don't have a blender and it didn't work that well.  I had to remove the whole cinnamon sticks.  (It was a hot mess!)  I love hot beverages and this is a good addition to the repertoire.  Portland, Oregon10/24/2020So two things:\n\nFirst, in answer to the other commenter, yes, the recipe is correct as written and you blend the spices into the drink. Very nicely spiced at the ratios here. \n\nSecond, the recipe says to strain through a fine sieve. I would recommend using a medium-fine colander instead. I used my fine sieve first and it caught all the spice bits but also most of the blended cashew solids. This significantly thinned out the drink. Passing it back through a slightly coarser colander did the trick, catching the leftover spice bits but letting the cashew solids pass through. The result was a delicious and full-bodied drink. \n\nTip: delicious (very) cold too!AnonymousPrinceton, NJ10/10/2020Actually asking a question before I make this- it would appear you blend up the cinnamon sticks along with the rest. Is that true??? Sounds entirely wild to do so and I'd hate to waste all that milk and cashews if it turns out that is, in fact, an awful idea. henrykat1Chicago 10/7/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titHot DrinkDrinks AllCashewNutDrinksGluten-FreeNonalcoholicRecipes you want to make.
