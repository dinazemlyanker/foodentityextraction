Caramel is high on that list. (Also: aioli.)Caramel is wonderful but fussy. The sugar can clump, seize, crystallize, or burn. And while there are all sorts of tricks for ensuring this doesn\u2019t happen (like, brushing the side of your pot with a damp pastry brush or adding corn syrup or cream of tartar), sometimes I\u2019m not prepared to take on risks for something that\u2019s supposed to be all about pleasure.That\u2019s why, when I\u2019m craving caramel and can\u2019t deal with the worry, I turn to butterscotch, its more reliable, less dramatic cousin. But what is butterscotch, exactly? Whereas caramel is made by cooking white sugar until it melts, darkens, and breaks down into its component parts, which in turn react with each other to create complex aromas, butterscotch is built on brown sugar, which gives it a couple of advantages. The addition of molasses, the source of brown sugar\u2019s darker color and deeper flavor, means it\u2019s both more moist and more acidic than white sugar. Acidity helps fight crystallization (that\u2019s why you\u2019ll often see acidic ingredients, like lemon juice, vinegar, or the aforementioned cream of tartar, added to traditional caramel recipes), and the moisture means it\u2019s slower to burn.Plus, butterscotch is most commonly made by melting brown sugar with butter (rather than on its own), which helps the granules to dissolve evenly and melt gently. You\u2019re sidestepping all of the usual caramel issues\u2014there\u2019s less that can go wrong.Butterscotch isn\u2019t a dead ringer for caramel\u2014it\u2019s usually sweeter, softer, and richer, without those bitter notes that makes caramel so special and, you know, sophisticated. But it\u2019s close enough for me, especially when the butterscotch is just a component of a dish, like the sauce glazing a cake or one layer of Tahini Billionaire Bars. I think that butterscotch tastes best with plenty of salt and an ingredient that will cut through the richness\u2014whether it\u2019s tangy sour cream or savory tahini.Give butterscotch a chance. You may not miss caramel, and you definitely won\u2019t miss the stress you would\u2019ve endured trying to make it.Get the recipe:Tahini Billionaire BarsWe took millionaire bars\u2014shortbread plus caramel plus chocolate\u2014and gave them an upgrade (hence, billions) with sesame seeds and tahini. The shortbread is tender, the filling is gooey, and the chocolate ties it all together.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasically BakingRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
