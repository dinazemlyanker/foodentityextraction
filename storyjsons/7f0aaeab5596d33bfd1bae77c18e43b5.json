Even simple side dishes of garlicky greens become infinitely faster when virtually all the prep work is done ahead of time.IngredientsMakes about 12 balls3large bunches Swiss chard, kale, mature spinach, collard greens, mustard greens, and/or broccoli rabe (about 3 lb.), ribs and stems removedKosher saltPreparationStep 1Working in batches, cook greens in a large pot of boiling heavily salted water just until wilted and bright green, about 20 seconds. Using tongs or a sieve, transfer greens to a colander set in a large bowl of ice water and let cool.Step 2Lift colander from ice water and drain greens well. Using your hands, squeeze out as much excess water as you can. Transfer to a cutting board and coarsely chop. Mold greens into small compact balls (about 1 oz. each), then squeeze out as much water as possible again (this will prevent ice crystals from forming on frozen greens).Step 3Place balls on a small parchment-lined baking sheet and freeze until solid, about 30 minutes. Transfer to a resealable plastic bag and close, squeezing out as much air as possible. Return to freezer.Step 4Do Ahead: Greens can be blanched 2 months ahead.
