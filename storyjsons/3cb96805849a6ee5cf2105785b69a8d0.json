He used to edit this site right here, and he loves beans. Like, so much. They say you develop the personality traits of the people you spend a lot of time with, and after sitting about 10 feet away from him for two years, we both picked up certain things. I\u2019d like to think Amiel learned about Instagram from me, and I definitely learned about beans from him.Ya see, we weren\u2019t a big bean household growing up. I\u2019m not sure if it was because my dad loved the \u201cmagical fruit\u201d phrase or what, but legumes were not a part of our daily diet. I used to tell my parents I was sad they never enrolled me in karate, and now I tell them I\u2019m sad I didn\u2019t discover the magic of beans until age 25.I mean how could you resist?\nAlex LauSo thank goodness for Amiel. He showed me how to zhuzh up canned beans, crisp chickpeas, and soak lima beans overnight. He taught me how to turn black beans into a flavorful soup showered with Fritos. He told me which bags to add to my Rancho Gordo order and how to save my bean cooking liquid for later use. Recently Amiel moved upstate, and there\u2019s now a void in the shape of Amiel holding a bag of perfect cannellinis.But then the August Simple Issue came out, and I flipped it open to a beautiful photo of big ol\u2019 white beans and fat, juicy tomatoes in what Kelly Mariani, owner at Scribe Winery, calls Big Beans and Tomato Vinaigrette. I may have needed a lesson about beans, but I\u2019m from New Jersey so I know about tomatoes. And I will use any excuse in August to eat them.A weekday dinner party is that excuse. And because August heirlooms are gorgeous without any effort, and you can cook the beans the day before, the only thing you\u2019re actually doing is blitzing a few things in a blender! Ready?Assuming that you\u2019ve made your beans the night before, you\u2019ll drain them of their liquid (use it in place of water or stock in your next soup!), and put them in a big bowl. Then you\u2019ll pur\u00e9e cherry tomatoes, and stir in garlic, vinegar, oil, and salt. After 15 minutes, you\u2019ll pluck the garlic out. (This is to get the essence of garlic, without actually eating garlic.) Toss the vin and the beans together and spoon over sliced heirloom tomatoes that have been drizzled with salt, pepper, and oil. It\u2019s not mandatory but it is aesthetically pleasing to slice up the heirlooms in random pieces for dramatic effect. Top the whole thing with some basil and red pepper flakes and you\u2019re good to go!I\u2019m a bean lover for life now, and this recipe is one that\u2019ll stick around in my repertoire every summer.Beans, baby:Big Beans and Tomato VinaigretteThe cold bean salad you\u2019ve been craving this summer.
