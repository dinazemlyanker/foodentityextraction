Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you\u2019ll get the scoop before everyone else.Dear Healthyish friends,\u201cVacation\u201d these days doesn\u2019t look the way I thought it would when I was making summer plans. Instead of daydreaming about traveling by plane, I find myself eagerly anticipating the next time a friend tells me they\u2019re leaving town so I can ask to (a) borrow their car or (b) house-sit for a change of scenery. Besides a long-weekend trip to Hudson that my roommates and I took a couple of months ago, I haven\u2019t left New York City in four months.Whether I\u2019m staying in an Airbnb or just someone else\u2019s house for a few days, if I know I\u2019m going to be cooking away from my own home, I get a little...particular about the things I bring with me. In addition to a toothbrush, underwear, and socks, I\u2019ll also pack a small tin of flaky sea salt, my favorite heatproof spatula, and a bottle of good olive oil.Part of it is that I like to be prepared for the worst, particularly when faced with a less-than-stocked vacation rental (or a friend\u2019s vacant home two miles away in Brooklyn) that comes with those weird glass cutting boards and nothing sharper than a butter knife. But part of it is just that I like having my creature comforts and tools available to me when I cook. The tools I use to cook at home are now so familiar to me that they\u2019ve become extensions of my hands; trying to use someone else\u2019s is like trying to fill in the fine details in a landscape portrait with a paint roller. (Dramatic, yes, but you know what I mean!)Still, I can\u2019t bring everything. So, over the years, I\u2019ve fine-tuned my packing list of kitchen equipment, tools, and dry goods to contain only my ride-or-dies, the things I\u2019ll take no matter where I\u2019m going or how long I\u2019m staying. All I\u2019m saying is: Once you start traveling with your Microplane, you may never go on another trip without it.Flaky salt \u00a0Jacobsen makes very adorable tins of their crunchy sea salt that you can stash in any bag. I sprinkle a pinch over tomato toast, fried eggs, and sliced avocados with lemon juice.Freshly ground coffee and filters \u00a0I\u2019m too caffeine-reliant to leave my coffee choices up to the caprices of a vacation-homeowner. I\u2019ll grind up enough coffee beans in advance at home, then store the grounds in a reusable plastic pint container or a glass jar.Kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, and chile flakes \u00a0As long as I have a pint container of Diamond kosher salt, a small pepper mill loaded with black peppercorns, and a jar of Burlap & Barrel\u2019s Silk Chili flakes, I\u2019ll always be able to make food that tastes good, even if that\u2019s a bowl of buttered pasta.A good all-purpose olive oil \u00a0A high-quality everyday oil, like California Olive Ranch, comes in handy for frying eggs, finishing vegetables off the grill, and making salad dressings. I pack mine in a small lightweight squeeze bottle with a cap so I don\u2019t have to lug around a heavy glass bottle.A favorite condiment or three \u00a0For me, that\u2019s a small bottle of mayo for sandwiches and potato salads, a jar of Dijon mustard for spreading on aforementioned sandwiches and emulsifying salad dressings, and a jar of kicky chili oil (I love the one from Xi\u2019an Famous Foods in New York).MVP utensils \u00a0I don\u2019t want to bring along my entire utensil crock, so I pick just the tools that I know will vastly improve my life no matter where I\u2019m cooking: a mini whisk (for scrambling eggs and making vinaigrettes), a wooden spoon, my GIR heatproof spatula (also: can you be in love with a spatula?!), my large Kunz spoon, a Microplane, and a petty knife, which is smaller than a chef\u2019s knife and thus packs up nicely.Extra plastic quart and pint containers \u00a0Not only do I use them as storage vessels for the kosher salt, ground coffee, etc., but I also pack extras for leftovers as well as snacks for hikes or picnics.A wine key \u00a0Self-explanatory.
