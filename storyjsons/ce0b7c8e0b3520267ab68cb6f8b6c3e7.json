We\u2019ll let Simone take it from here.All of China comes together because they have this one single thing that they dream about, which is Chinese New Year. Whatever hardship or unfortunate things or great things you\u2019ve been through, you always hope the next year is better. Because to us, it\u2019s more than a celebration. It\u2019s a moment to get rid of all the bad, unfortunate things\u2014and bring more good fortune into the next year.On New Year\u2019s Eve you\u2019re supposed to deep clean. And then take a shower. (On New Year\u2019s Day you\u2019re not supposed to do any cleaning because if you get rid of anything, that means you\u2019re also getting rid of all the good fortune.) We look at the Chinese Zodiac\u2014we take that thing a little more seriously than what\u2019s on the websites\u2014and we study our animal signs. This year, which begins February 16 and ends March 2, will be Year of the Dog. According to my mom, it's supposed to be a great year. Whatever you do in those 15 days, you want to keep bringing as much good luck as you can. Which means giving people, and kids, money in red envelopes; visiting your elderly, trying to help them out. And then it also means cooking a lot of good food.Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Anna Billingskog, Prop Styling by Heather GreeneThe reunion dinner, on New Year\u2019s Eve, is the biggest celebration. We\u2019d all gather in my grandparents\u2019 house. It gets very crowded. My aunties, uncles, mom, and my grandparents always cooked\u2014usually 20 different dishes! Fish, pork, vegetables, everything that we can find from the land, sea, and air. The more the better. For dessert, we eat tang yuan, sticky rice balls filled with black sesame paste and served in a sweet soup. In China, every single province, every village, every region, has different dishes and styles. There\u2019s alcohol and flowers, fruits, cheese. And fireworks. After midnight we do a lot of fireworks and firecrackers.But as kids, we looked forward to Chinese New Year because we got money. When I was a kid, that\u2019s the only pocket money I would have. I got a Walkman in 1989, when I was seven years old. I was so cool walking around with my Sony Walkman. Then around 1995, I got a Discman. It was always about music, at least for me. I also got some Nike shoes with the air pumps, and new clothes, a new haircut, to show all of my friends. We were obsessed with American brands. When I turned 18, I could go buy beer, explore parties.The higher you toss this prosperity salad\u2014the better your luck will be in the new year.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Anna Billingskog, Prop Styling by Heather GreeneBy celebrating Chinese New Year every day, we also hope to get the dragon out of sight. We don't want it to eat our children! They\u2019re supposed go to your house or villages, your roads and festivals, to grab whatever they see because they\u2019re hungry. We close the door, get the firecrackers going to make the dragon go next door. And we have lots of food, so we can just stay at home, cook, play Mahjong, watch TV\u2014just like Thanksgiving. But Thanksgiving on steroids, because it\u2019s 16 days.The superstition is that people don\u2019t die during Chinese New Year. It\u2019s the lowest rate of death\u2014people wait until after, when their kids have gone back home. It's always about harmony, unity, getting together, being a family. Whether you\u2019re overseas or in another city, you always want to go home during Chinese New Year to visit your grandparents and parents. It\u2019s the only time you get to reunite with where you come from. Whether you\u2019re a tribe, a town, a village, a household in the city, a tiny little apartment in the city, it doesn\u2019t matter, as long as you\u2019re together. It doesn\u2019t matter if you bring home anything or nothing at all. Hopefully you bring home a boyfriend or girlfriend. The Chinese view is about prolonging this ancestry. Our biggest celebration is so serious!When I came to UNC-Chapel Hill, North Carolina for college, I couldn\u2019t go home because Chinese New Year fell in the middle of the semester. I\u2019d celebrate with my non-Chinese friends and cook for them\u2014chicken salad, pan-seared wontons, but I also make this shrimp and pasta. Shrimp and pasta was my signature dish in college.I came to New York in 2010, and every restaurant I\u2019ve worked for I always make it a point to tell every non-Chinese cook, \u201cHey, we\u2019re celebrating 15 days of Chinese New Year.\u201d So every day I make sure I tell them Happy New Year number seven, number four, number eight. They get sick of it, but I\u2019m making the fried dumplings and making sure they\u2019re enjoying this good, auspicious festival. I have to put money in the red pocket and give it to them because I think it's good luck for me and it will bless them for the entire year. My staff are mostly from the Bronx, they\u2019re not Chinese, but I\u2018m going to shower them with generosity and luck.What\u2019s on the MenuProsperity Salad (Yusheng)The higher you toss the salad with your chopsticks, the more luck you'll bring into the new year.View RecipeProsperity Salad (Yusheng):This salad only really pertains to overseas Chinese, like Singaporeans or Malaysians who are Chinese. We lift the salad really high with chopsticks with about 20 people around a round table. But that salad is very, very important because we want to lift up the spirit. The higher you raise your chopsticks to mix the salad, the better luck you\u2019ll get for the coming year. We eat this throughout the 15-day celebrations, and especially on the seventh day which is known as Ren Ri \u4eba\u65e5 (commonly known as \u201cevery person\u2019s birthday\u201d).This recipe is a Cantonese-style raw fish salad made with various shredded vegetables and served with assorted toppings, a sweet plum sauce and slices of raw fish (usually salmon sashimi, mackerel, or bass). The word for \u201craw fish\u201d is y\u00fash\u0113ng, but because the character for fish (\u9b5a) resembles its homophone \u201cabundance\u201d (\u4f59), \u201cy\u00fash\u0113ng\u201d is interpreted as meaning an increase in abundance. Therefore, the raw fish in this dish symbolizes of abundance, prosperity, good fortune, and vigor.Red-Braised Pork Belly (Hong Shao Rou)Simone Tong's red-braised pork belly is a must-have on Chinese New Year. You can see why.View RecipeRed-Braised Pork Belly (Hong Shao Rou):This traditional braised pork belly dish is a crowd-pleaser for any special occasion, and the bright red color symbolizes good luck. At home it\u2019s usually eaten with other Chinese New Year dishes over white rice. But it\u2019s also a great topping for noodles, lettuce, tortillas, and buns.Shrimp DumplingsDuring Chinese New Year, eating (and making) dumplings symbolizes unity, togetherness, and harmony.View RecipeShrimp Dumplings:We also have dumplings, especially in the north of China. Dumplings symbolize unity. Everybody gathers around the table to make dumplings. One family, regardless of how poor or wealthy, sitting under one roof eating dumplings, is happiness from within. In the North, they\u2019ll also put coins in the dumplings. If you bite it\u2014this is very old fashioned\u2014you\u2019re the luckiest person.Starting on February 15, Little Tong Noodle Shop is serving a special Chinese New Year dish each night for 16 days. We\u2019ve got our eyes on the red-braised pork belly being served February 18, the Wagyu mixian noodles on February 20, and tea-smoked duck on February 27.As told to Alex BeggsExplore Bon App\u00e9titPork BellyChineseDumplingsChinese New Year Recipes you want to make.
