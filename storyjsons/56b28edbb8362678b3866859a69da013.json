The New York City soft serve shop swirls velvety-smooth ice cream in various appealing hues\u2014Kermit-green matcha, periwinkle purple ube, cotton-candy pink lychee\u2014any of which I\u2019d be tempted to use to paint a wall of my living room. (It\u2019s called an accent wall, okay???)As if the colors weren\u2019t stunning enough, they\u2019re churned into cups or cones to heights that rival Marge Simpson\u2019s hair, in shapes that are textbook \u201csoft serve.\u201d And then there are the toppings affixed to the sides: Fruity Pebbles, Lucky Charm marshmallows, toasted coconut, freeze-dried strawberries, mochi, boba, red bean. It\u2019s a visual fantasy straight out of my 1996 Lisa Frank obsession.It\u2019s definitely something to look at (and the shop\u2019s 50,000-plus Instagram followers agree). Yet I wasn\u2019t convinced it would taste any good. I\u2019ve been burned by too many pretty-faced desserts that haven\u2019t lived up to their Instagram fame to go in feeling optimistic.But the Lower East Side spot slapped the skepticism out of me: the flavors\u2014hojicha, matcha, sesame butter, black sesame, Hong Kong milk tea, coconut\u2014are intense and, shockingly, not saccharine-sweet. The texture is unbelievably creamy, without even a hint of ice crystal. I\u2019ve never even ordered an add-on, like caramel or sprinkles, or one of the Insta-famous \u201cSwerve Specials\u201d because I don\u2019t want to distract from the flavor or the creaminess.I love Soft Swerve so much, I choose where I\u2019m going for dinner based on its proximity. But even if I\u2019m not eating in the neighborhood, I\u2019ll always find an excuse to make a special trip.Go there: Soft SwerveExplore Bon App\u00e9titNew YorkHighly RecommendRestaurantsFrozen DessertIce CreamRecipes you want to make.
