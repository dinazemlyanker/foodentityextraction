Please, I beg you, trust me. I tell that to people quite frequently (because I am the type of person who talks about stromboli a lot) and no one seems to believe me. I give them a nice explanation as to what stromboli is and what a calzone is. They skeptically say, \u201cOk, yeah, sure,\u201d and then they walk away muttering something like, \u201cThat guy was weird, right?\u201dThat\u2019s not how this is going to go. I\u2019m going to tell you what the difference between a calzone and a stromboli is, and then you\u2019re going to write it in your journal and make it your mantra. Maybe you\u2019ll even get it tattooed on your body. Who\u2019s to say?Both calzones and stromboli are pizza derivatives. They utilize the same ingredients to achieve different versions of a sealed, portable pizza. There\u2019s pizza dough, cheese, and fillings. Sometimes there\u2019s sauce. We\u2019ll get into that in a second. Here\u2019s how they\u2019re different:The Sealing TechniqueThe major difference between a calzone and a stromboli is how they are sealed. If you wanted a very straightford comparison, here you go: a calzone is like a taco, and a stromboli is like a burrito. Tacos and calzones are always folded. Burritos and stromboli are always rolled. You seal a calzone by folding it in half and crimping the edges. You seal a stromboli by rolling it in a spiral and folding some extra dough back over the stromboli. Both get an egg wash to make sure the dough stays out.Calzones, sliced in half, are smaller and shaped like half-circles.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigThe Shape and SizeThe different sealing techniques mean that calzones and stromboli start as different shapes. When shaping dough for a calzone, you shape a circle. The folded circle creates a small half-circle. Calzones are generally single serving.When you shape dough to make a stromboli, you shape an elongated rectangle. The rectangle is rolled to create a long, skinny, cylindrical pizza cigar. Stromboli is meant to be sliced for multiple people.The OriginAnother difference is where they come from. Calzones are Italian. Actually, legitimately, 100%-certified, Italian. They originated in Naples as a casual, standing-on-the-street way of eating pizza, and they vary in terms of ingredients and techniques in different regions in Italy.Stromboli is Italian-American. It originated in Philadelphia, from the depths of the Italian-heavy neighborhood of South Philly. It was named after the Italian Isle of Stromboli. On the Isle of Stromboli, there\u2019s a giant volcano called Mt. Stromboli. If that doesn\u2019t get you stoked to be alive, I don\u2019t really think I can help you.Cross-sections of stromboli, filled with ingredienTs like spinach, pepperoni, fennel, and sausage.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigThe FillingsThere\u2019s a lot of crossover in the filling category. Ingredients like cured meats, vegetables, and herbs can be used in both calzones and stromboli, but there are two things that set them apart. Calzones use ricotta cheese, and stromboli does not. Stromboli is made with mozzarella cheese (preferably low-moisture) to keep moisture at a minimum. This helps the interior dough cook fully. Calzones usually use a blend of cheese that almost always incorporates ricotta.And then there\u2019s sauce. Calzones never have tomato sauce inside the dough. They\u2019re always dipped. While stromboli is also dip-able, it\u2019s totally cool to put some sauce inside stromboli, pre-roll.Whether you\u2019re team stromboli or team calzone, these distinctions shouldn\u2019t inspire hate. We\u2019re here to appreciate the differences, not yell about them. This whole thing is about growing as human beings. And finding ways to eat more pizza.OK. That should be it. You believe me. Or at least you should. Good luck with that tattoo.Yeah, let's make some stromboli.This Tax Season Stromboli Recipe Is My Only DependentIt's basically just a pizza rolled up into a giant log.
