The lime really makes a difference. Soaking the cashews overnight helps to blend them more smoothly.Kiran12/15/2020Oh my goodness! This was by far one of the best smoothies that I've had. I am a big blueberry and cashew fan, so it was perfect for me. Prep time was super fast and it's a healthy smoothie. Can't ask for more than that!
