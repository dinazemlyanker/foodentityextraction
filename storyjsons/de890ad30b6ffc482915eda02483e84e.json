We simplified Wolfert\u2019s steam-then-cook method and added toast and cheese for good measure. It\u2019s the best way to use up a variety of herbs and greens that you might have in your crisper drawer. This recipe is part of the Healthyish Farmers\u2019 Market Challenge.

Let sit until cool enough to handle. Pick out garlic and transfer to a small bowl; using a fork, smash to a paste.Step 3Squeeze any excess water out of greens and herbs. Transfer to a cutting board, finely chop, and set aside.Step 4Wipe out skillet. Heat \u00bd cup oil over medium-low.

Add chopped greens and herbs and cook, stirring often, until most of the moisture is cooked out of the greens, 10\u201315 minutes. Add garlic and coriander. Using a wooden spoon, mash garlic into greens mixture and stir to combine. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until well combined and flavors have melded, about 5 minutes more. Remove from heat. Season with salt and stir in lemon juice and remaining \u00bc cup oil.Step 5Spoon ricotta on toast and top with herb jam.

I made it with kale, parsley, and dill\u2013 what I had on hand. I'm looking forward to trying this recipe with other combinations of greens. It was awesome on toast with feta cheese, and on quinoa with feta and harissa. \n\nMake sure to keep a close eye on the pot while steaming though. I got distracted for a few minutes and the bottom scorched, leaving a layer of crunchy burnt leaves (I pulled off the top layer for the rest of the recipe). Anonymous1/18/2021I used some discounted cavolo nero and coriander I found at the shop - result seems more crispy/fried than a jam exactly but it tastes good!AnonymousUK5/12/2020So good! I used Swiss chard, but wondering if kale would also work. Turned out beautifully!New York4/21/2020This is a great recipe to use up greens and herbs!AnonymousIthaca, New York10/7/2019How long will this keep in the fridge if I don\u2019t use it all after making it? More than 5 days?AnonymousLos Angeles 9/8/2019Can we please talk about the liquid that is left over when you pull the greens, herbs  and spinach out to cool? A pinch of salt and it\u2019s the tastiest veggie tonic i\u2019ve had in a long time!AlohachanjHonolulu8/26/2019This is brilliant. Our garden is running amok with greens and herbs. Am going to boil the jars as in regular jam making so I can make in quantity. Absolutely fantastic recipe. I don't eat garlic but shallots or sweet onions work beautifully. lindagalleryCalifornia 8/12/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titToastJamSpreadsMediterraneanSwiss ChardLeafy GreensVegetableSpinachArugulaBroccoli RabeParsleyHerbs & SpicesMintCilantroRicottaCheeseSummerEasyWeeknight MealsStarterNut-FreeVegetarianKetoHealthyishLunchRecipes you want to make.
