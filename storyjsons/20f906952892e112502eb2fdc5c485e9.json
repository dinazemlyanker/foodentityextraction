Attjack8/12/2021I\u2019ve made this so many times, it\u2019s definitely a go-to when I\u2019m having guests or bringing a dish to a party. I typically go for hazelnuts, cotija, a combo of lime juice and champagne vinegar, Italian parsley and mint, and a jalape\u00f1o or Fresno chile instead of a serrano. It\u2019s the perfect bite of summer flavor all in one spoonful! AnonymousCA7/25/2021Love this! Then again, I love roasted summer corn in most any form. Made this pretty much faithful to the recipe as written, with pistachios and feta. We had basil & mint in the garden and cilantro in the fridge. Juiced a lime for the citrus. One change in the prep seemed like a no-brainer to me (pun intended): it's summer here, and hot! - great for fresh corn but not so good for heating up the oven (and the kitchen) just to roast some nuts. Once the corn was finished grilling, I simply turned off the gas flame and put the pistachios in there on some aluminum foil for ~ 5 minutes. Perfect, and didn't let that leftover heat go to waste.kenppdxPortland, OR6/27/2021Used pistachios and feta. Also roasted some of the corn in the oven. Delicious.AnonymousBirmingham, MI5/31/2021Delicious. Used frozen corn kernels by baking them in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes (& seasoning them with salt, pepper, paprika, & 1 tbsp of salt). Added a little lemon for some extra brightness. AnonymousNew York3/15/2021Fantastic! I had this with some pan-fried shrimp and it was so fresh and delish. emmatoHong Kong8/2/2019So simple, so flavorful! I used pistachios, feta, cilantro, and lime. Tastes like summer!AnonymousNew York 7/15/2019Holy cow was this good! I can see trying different herbs etc but it was lovely as is. I let the peppers & about half of the cilantro hang out in the lime juice while I did the other prep & it amped it up a little! ladydei775177Capital DistrictRegion7/8/2019Yes yes yes. I used cotija and peanuts, and my guests were freaking out about how good this was. It's a new staple! AnonymousSaint Louis, MO7/8/2019So good!!!!!   Used pine nuts and feta. We finished it before dinner....couldn\u2019t wait. Lol AnonymousPortland,Oregon7/7/2019THIS WAS KILLER! My whole family of 9 loved this so so much. It was a perfect side dish with the Party Steak with Salsa Verde from you guys.
