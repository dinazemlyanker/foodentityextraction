This restaurant is the good kind of exception.By Dream HamptonJune 6, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Michelle & Chris GerardFacebookTwitterEmailThis is part of our series that celebrates America\u2019s Favorite Neighborhood Restaurants. We asked 80 of the most interesting people we know to reveal the local spots they love the most.\u201cI only want problems worth having,\u201d a wise but exasperated Detroit native (a stranger seated nearby) once said over dinner. Detroit has a food problem. Our new food problem isn\u2019t connected to our old food problem, which was misdescribed by the concerned as everything from \u201cfood desert\u201d to \u201cfood swamp.\u201d What, in fact, began happening when I was born in my beleaguered hometown in the \u201970s was a corporate boycott of our super black city. It extended from restaurants to grocery stores that would open, say, up to half a dozen locations in historically Waspy neighborhoods like Grosse Pointe, while pretending Detroit itself didn\u2019t exist. Detroiters, who, it turns out, do indeed eat food, solved that problem long ago by transforming over a thousand vacant lots into beautiful food gardens. No, our new problem is the same old segregation that led to the white mob riots in 1943 and the black rebellion in 1967. We've got new restaurants seemingly so averse to hiring from Detroit's local population (83 percent of whom are black), that they posted billboards in Brooklyn and Manhattan looking for waitstaff.What could truly be an exciting food scene is made ridiculous by staff casting that is simply offensive. Our food scene seems to promise a Detroit experience without actual native Detroiters. I\u2019m spending a significant portion of a pretty small article complaining about said food scene because that\u2019s what us Detroiters do: plop down in one of the newest joints that is flash-frying squash blossoms to perfection, only to bemoan the white-washing of it all.The salt and pepper prawns.\nPhoto by Michelle & Chris GerardFlowers of Vietnam is a blissful exception to Detroit\u2019s segregated landscape. In 2016 chef George Azar, then 27, convinced his Palestinian dad to let him do weekend night pop-ups in the Mexicantown Vernor Coney Island diner he leased. We flocked there for the salty T\u00f4m Rang Mu\u1ed1i (salt and pepper prawns), while George stood behind the counter bullying us into eating the shrimp\u2019s crunchy shell head \u201cthe right way.\u201dAzar worked in kitchens such as Alinea in Chicago and Bouchon Bistro in Las Vegas, but like a lot of us Detroiters, he felt compelled to return home for what finally looked like the city\u2019s long promised renaissance. Later, Azar began focusing on contributing to Detroit\u2019s rebirth, \u201cwhich may feel clich\u00e8 but definitely feels right as a Detroiter.\u201dDetroit\u2019s hipster restaurant revival began in earnest in 2005 at Phil Cooley\u2019s barbecue spot, Slows, so Azar knew to include familiar items on the Flowers of Vietnam menu. \u201cThe whole reason that I serve chicken wings is because I know my fellow Detroiters, and I know my Michigan clientele. I\u2019m like, Look bro, look, here\u2019s these chicken wings. They\u2019re into it because they\u2019re crispy and glossy. After, I\u2019ll spring the fact that the caramelization comes from fish sauce.\u201dFlowers of Vietnam was named one the country\u2019s best new restaurants by GQ in 2017, and went from pop-up to full-time restaurant this January. When Azar transformed the Coney into more than a pop-up, he \u201cwanted to keep the Coney alive as much as possible.\u201d When he created the horseshoe bar and uncovered distressed walls, he simply sealed the exposed platers.Most of Flowers of Vietnam\u2019s cultlike following, who\u2019ve been returning since it was a pop-up, are loyal because the food is bright, authentic, delicious. Some of us native Detroiters are relieved to see a place whose kitchen is brilliant and consistent and where the floor looks like we\u2019re in the D. As to why his fellow local restaurateurs can\u2019t seem to find even a black dishwasher for their open kitchens: \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe they\u2019re scared that women from Birmingham [MI] will turn around and head back to the suburbs. Not me. I put Vera right up front at the host stand. She\u2019s as Detroit as it gets.\u201d Indeed, Vera rubbed my back as she guided me to the bar because I\u2019d failed to make reservations at Detroit\u2019s newest and best hot spot. When the bartender told me my favorite, the bok choy, had been 86ed ten minutes before I sat down, a cool white couple slid me their untouched side dish of the charred, spicy, sweet stems and silently accepted my grateful fist bump.dream hampton is a writer, cultural critic, and filmmaker currently producing a docuseries about R.
