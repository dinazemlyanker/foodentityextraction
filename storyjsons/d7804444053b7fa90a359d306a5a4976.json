What started as a wonderful idea\u2014old school pasta salad with green olives and an entire jar of Hellmann\u2019s!\u2014turns into slimy sludge as the sun beats down on your super cute picnic. That\u2019s why we set out to develop a summer pasta salad that can stand up to the heat, and maybe even bring a little itself. Something that travels well, tastes like summer, and matches a variety of plaid blankets. Molly Baz\u2019s jammy pepper pasta salad is what we got, and we\u2019re extremely happy about it.It stars sweet bell peppers (we\u2019ll leave the colors up to you; no comment on green) that get the caramelized onion treatment with spicy chiles (if you want), garlic, thyme, salt, a little sugar to help everything brown, and vinegar in a Dutch oven over medium-low. It\u2019s mostly hands-off at this point, a stir here and there, until the peppers get silky (give it around an hour). That\u2019s essentially your sauce, and it\u2019s reminiscent of your favorite Italian salad dressing with that sweet-spicy-tangy vibe. I also call it lip-smacky, for which the thesaurus had no other alternatives.The rest of the salad can come together in the meantime: quickly pickle some red onion for a hit of acid, boil some rigatoni (the preferred pasta to catch the sauces in its outer ridges and inner tube), toast some hazelnuts, dig around the closets for that picnic blanket with the tarp-thingy on one side. Once the peppers are ready, combine everything and top with a cheese that won\u2019t melt or, shudder, sweat in the sun, like creamy-salty ricotta salata. A few tears of fresh basil and you\u2019re ready to go.The jammy pepper mixture, we also realized, would be incredible as a bruschetta/toast topping, or served on a platter with ricotta, or squished into a veggie sandwich. It\u2019s as versatile as that tie-dye shirt you\u2019re wearing everywhere this summer. Yeah, we\u2019ve seen it. You look great. You\u2019re really pulling it off. It\u2019s amazing how appropriate it is for every occasion, just like...this...recipe...Get the recipe:Jammy Pepper Pasta SaladThis spicy, sweet, and punchy pasta salad is perfect for a hot summer picnic when you need your dishes perfect at room (ahem, air) temperature.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBell PepperPicnicPastaSaladSummer SidesRecipes you want to make.
