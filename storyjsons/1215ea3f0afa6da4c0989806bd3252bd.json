Let Me Count the LayersAt Grand Opening, a pastry pop-up inside Mister Jiu\u2019s in San Francisco, chef Melissa Chou puts a California spin on the classic dessert.By Rachel KartenFebruary 24, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Aubrie PickFacebookTwitterEmailIn Dish Decoded, we break down all the components, stories, and techniques behind a restaurant\u2019s... well... dish that we\u2019re obsessed with right now.At Grand Opening, chef Melissa Chou puts a seasonal California spin on the classic Chinese sponge cake. But, uh, you can only get a slice of it one day each month. That\u2019s because Grand Opening is a pastry pop-up at Mister Jiu\u2019s (a Hot 10 2017 alum!) in San Francisco, open just the second Saturday of every month. From 10 a.m. until they run out, Chou and the team sell riffs on Chinese baked goods, like wife cookies layered with quince and black sesame and chewy brandied cherry nian gao. But the one dish we can\u2019t stop thinking about is the cloud-like Chinese sponge cake. Here Chou breaks down it comes together.The Sponge\u201cA sponge cake is a really iconic Chinese bakery item,\u201d Chou says. \u201cAnd what makes it appealing is that it\u2019s really soft.\u201d While some versions rely on leaveners, Chou achieves maximum fluff by whipping egg yolks and whites before folding in rice bran oil, sugar, and King Arthur unbleached cake flour.The FruitMost Chinese bakeries feature a pretty standard mix of fruits in the cake, like mangoes and kiwis. Chou instead takes a cue from the seasons, which means strawberries in the summer and mandarins right now. She buys hers from nearby Guru Ram Das Orchards. She loves that they are juicy, sweet, and only slightly acidic\u2014the perfect complement to the rich vanilla-bean-and-beaten-egg-white cream surrounding the citrus chunks.The Lychee LayerIn the middle of the cake, Chou slides in a lychee gele\u0301e. It\u2019s a nod to the fruit jams typically found in traditional Chinese sponge cakes. Because fresh lychees are hard to come by, she relies on a frozen French pure\u0301e and mixes it with gelatin for the gele\u0301e. Chou spreads the gele\u0301e over a pastry cream made of cream that\u2019s steeped and then strained with toasted coconut and coconut milk.The Tippity TopChou makes not one but THREE different creams for this cake. \u201cThough they\u2019re subtle, the idea is that there are lots of textures,\u201d she explains. While the two creams inside the cake are light and airy, the crowning layer is a mascarpone-and-whipped-cream mixture to add some heft and tang.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsDessertDish DecodedRead MorecultureThis Dive Bar Is Turning Out the Best Burger in OaklandBy Julia KramercultureI Instagram-Stalked This Croissant, So I Found Out How It\u2019s MadeBy Rachel KartenrestaurantsChef Pierre Thiam of Harlem\u2019s Teranga Makes Classic Jollof Feel FreshBy Jesse SparkscultureThe Halo-Halo at Philadelphia\u2019s Sarvida Is 5 Layers of PerfectionBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
