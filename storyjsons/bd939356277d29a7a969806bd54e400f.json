Distinct, pull-apart layers are synonymous with biscuit success, yet somehow you\u2019re more likely to see them in a bakery display than a home kitchen.Well, that\u2019s enough of that. I\u2019m taking matters into my own hands and putting a stop to sub-par homemade biscuits once and for all. These simple tricks of the trade will ensure that your biscuits come out flaky AF every time, no need to cross your fingers and hope for the best.1. Use cold butter (and keep it that way)By keeping your butter as cold as possible as you work it into the dough, you'll guarantee that the distinct pieces create pockets of steam that push the layers apart. If the butter is too warm when you\u2019re working with it, it will melt too quickly, seeping into the biscuit dough rather than turning into steam. To keep the butter cold, work with it straight from the fridge and move quickly so that the warmth of your hands doesn\u2019t make the butter too soft. For extra insurance, some bakers even chill their bowl and their flour before incorporating the butter just to make sure everything stays calm, cool, and collected.2. Peas and lentils, peopleAs you work the butter into the dry ingredients by pinching, squeezing, and flattening between your palms, be careful not to over-incorporate. Aim for pieces between the size of a pea and a lentil\u2014and no smaller. If the pieces are too itsy-bitsy, the butter won\u2019t create enough steam to cause puff-age.3. Fold, pat, repeatAs you\u2019ll find in this recipe for Sour Cream and Onion Biscuits, we\u2019ve included a dough folding trick that will guarantee success, even if you fail to succeed at the other two tips. You\u2019ll pat your biscuit dough out into an 8x4\" rectangle and then fold the rectangle in thirds by bringing the short sides into the center, just like you would fold a business letter (or swaddle a baby?). You\u2019ll pat the dough down again, and repeat the letter fold once more.The physical folds you create translate into distinct layers before the biscuits even hit the oven. Magic! Perhaps you\u2019ve heard the word lamination thrown around in the context of croissants or puff pastry. This letter folding technique is essentially a very chill and simplified version of exactly that. We use a similar manual method in BA's Best Buttermilk Biscuits.Now go forth and make biscuits. They'll have more layers than your mom on a chilly day. They'll be flakier than your flakiest friend on a Friday night. And they'll look like they came straight from a bakery.Get the recipe:Sour Cream and Onion BiscuitsIf you've ever had trouble making biscuits in the past, consider this recipe your saving grace. While many other methods count on pockets of butter and an angel\u2019s touch for pull-apart flakiness, we weren't willing to leave it to chance. Our simple folding technique manually multiplies the number of layers for guaranteed, no-risk success.\u00a0View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBiscuitBasically BakingRecipes you want to make.
