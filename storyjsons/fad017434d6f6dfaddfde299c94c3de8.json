See our past recommendations here!In the five-ish years that I\u2019ve lived in New York, where we are all essentially swaddled in a warm blanket of germs, I have never needed to go to the doctor for being sick. *Aggressively knocks on wood*  And when people ask how, the answer is always Wellness Formula vitamins.Every time I feel a little off\u2014scratch in the back of my throat, clammy hands, runny nose\u2014I take six capsules twice a day. Within a day or two, I am completely free of any symptoms. That\u2019s because each capsule is packed with antioxidants, herbal extracts, vitamins, and minerals\u2014from garlic bulb to echinacea to astragalus\u2014that each address and support a specific part of your immune system. I like to think of Wellness Formula as the Marvel movie of vitamins, with every ingredient (there are over 30 of them!) doing its part to fight off the evil New York germs plotting an attack on my immune system. \u2013 Rachel Karten, senior social media manager.Buy it: Source Naturals Wellness Formula, $31 for 240 capsules.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
