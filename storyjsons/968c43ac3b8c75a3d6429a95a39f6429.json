I refuse to do the sane thing, which is to Kondo it all and stock only one kind (Carla Lalli Music is good at this; I am not), because I love them all too much. I crave the fiery heat from a good shake of crushed red pepper flakes on pastas and pizza. I sprinkle savory and bright Aleppo-style pepper on everything from dips to quick pickles to avocado toast. But the chile flake I cook with the most often is Korean gochugaru (GO-choo-GAH-roo).This crunchy fennel dish gets dressed in a spicy-tangy-sweet gochugaru sauce.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Susie Theodorou, Prop Styling by Ayesha PatelI think of gochugaru as an ideal gateway chile flake for spice scaredies. Its heat is gentle and nowhere near as hot as an equivalent amount of crushed red pepper flakes\u2014think more like poblano- or jalape\u00f1o-level hot. And where some chile flakes are blah and one-note, gochugaru has so much more to offer with its fruity, smoky, and sweet smell and flavor. It\u2019s the ingredient that gives kimchi its signature heat and color, and also a common flavoring agent in Korean soups and stews like Kimchi Jjigae or the fiery soft tofu stew known as soondubu.But gochugaru\u2019s uses extend far beyond the world of kimchi and kimchi-based stews. Use it to make the garlicky chile oil that\u2019s spooned over these steak short ribs. Shower popcorn, dips, and toasts with a hit of that crimson glitter. Make Crunchy Gochujang Fennel, because spicy fennel deserves to be more of a thing. Make senior food editor Chris Morocco\u2019s hot-sweet-salty take on bulgogi, then make it two more times this week because it is that good.Look for brands that say \"taekyung\" or \"taeyangcho\" on the package\u2014this means the chiles have been sun-dried rather than artificially dried.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigNow that I\u2019ve convinced you it\u2019s perfectly normal and acceptable to add another chile flake to your budding collection, here are a few Helpful Buying Tips: First, it\u2019s absolutely worth paying a bit more for the good stuff. In the world of gochugaru, that means looking for the words \u201csun-dried\u201d (also \u201ctaekyung\u201d/\u201ctaeyangcho\u201d) on the package. Look for coarse flakes, which resemble flaky sea salt, and are the go-to style in Korean kitchens (finer gochugaru is often used for making gochujang.) Many Korean cooks keep a huge bag of gochugaru on hand (I store in my freezer to keep it fresh), but if you\u2019re not planning to make gallons of your own kimchi, buy in smaller quantities and re-up as needed. And although you can now generally find gochugaru at well-stocked Asian grocers, I find it can be overwhelming to compare brands on the spot, which is why I recommend buying it\u2014where else?\u2014online.Buy It: Medium Spicy Tae-kyung Korean Red Chili Pepper Powder, $10 on amazon.comAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
