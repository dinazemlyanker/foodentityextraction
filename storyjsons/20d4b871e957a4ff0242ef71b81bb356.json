Sure, I could try something new (it\u2019s my job!), but why would I when I know I\u2019ll be grumpy, hungry, jet-lagged, and have already decided that I\u2019m going to the same place for the same thing that always cures my grumpy, hungry, jet-lagged state: the house cold noodle at Chong Qing Xiao Mian.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.The three-year-old Sichuan standby from Z&Y veterans Jenny Wu and Truman Du does not have A/C, quick water refills, or any defining ambiance besides dark-wood veneer. But that\u2019s not what I\u2019m here for. I\u2019m here to recover from the chaos of flying coach with a noodle dish that wakes me up from my plane-induced stupor with sinus-clearing Sichuan peppercorns and fruity, fiery chile oil. The heat runs through the porky, ragu-like sauce that crowns a tangle of chewy, thin, extra-soft mixian noodles. Cool, crisp cucumber sticks tame the spice, and a snow cap of bright cilantro and toasted peanuts add some textural crunch and herby depth. After a vigorous stir, you get the perfect bite: nutty, meaty, grassy, and nose-running-ly spicy. It\u2019s the best\u2014and only\u2014San Francisco welcome I could ask for.Go there: Chong Qing Xiao MianExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsSan FranciscoRead MorerestaurantsI Tried Everything to Fill the Beef Noodle Soup\u2013Shaped Hole in My Heart, and Then I Found This PlaceBy Elyse InamineWhere to eatHow to Spend a Big Fat Weekend Eating All the Pastries in San FranciscoGallery12 SlidesBy Sarah JampelRecipes you want to make.
