The owner noticed.By Rainbow RowellJune 6, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Dana DamewoodFacebookTwitterEmailThis is part of our series that celebrates America\u2019s Favorite Neighborhood Restaurants. We asked 80 of the most interesting people we know to reveal the local spots they love the most.The first time Vera Razamazova gave me free soup, I thought it was because she thought I still worked for the newspaper.I was a columnist here in Omaha for nearly 11 years. It wasn\u2019t ever like being truly famous, but I could always tell when people recognized me, especially at restaurants. They\u2019d be nice to me in a way that wasn\u2019t really nice. They\u2019d insist I take free dessert, which I couldn\u2019t ethically eat.I\u2019d stop going to places when that happened.So when Vera sent out soup for me, my heart sunk. I couldn\u2019t give up El Basha. \u201cI can\u2019t eat this,\u201d I said to my husband. \u201cIt\u2019s graft.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t even work there anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cEat your soup.\u201dEl Basha\u2019s creamy lebneh and warm pita.\nPhoto by Dana DamewoodI ate it. It\u2019s El Basha\u2019s special yellow lentil soup. With fried bread for dipping. And fresh herbs and lemon. Vera stopped by the table later to make sure I liked it.Vera usually stops at the table, if the restaurant isn\u2019t too busy, to smile and say hello. Sometimes she\u2019ll wave at you from the kitchen. A few visits after this one (a few free bowls of soup later), she asked me what I did for a living.I must have looked like a maniac. Vera wasn\u2019t giving me free soup because she wanted me to write about her business\u2014she just knew that I loved the soup! I felt profoundly grateful.Okay, so maybe you\u2019re wondering why I wasn\u2019t just ordering the soup if I loved it so much\u2026The mezza plate is a must: hummus, tabbouleh, baba ghanuje, and falafel, with pita bread.\nPhoto by Dana DamewoodBecause, at El Basha, if you order a sandwich\u2014I recommend the kafta wrap, by the way; it\u2019s spiced ground beef, grilled on skewers, then wrapped with tahini and Turkish pickles\u2014you have your choice of french fries (good, but basic), lentil soup (heavenly), or warm garlicky potato salad (transcendent). I usually go with the potato salad and mourn the loss of the soup.Vera noticed.She\u2019s probably noticed that I try to order everything when I come to El Basha. My strategy is to go with a crowd and hope they like to share.The mezza plate is a must: hummus, tabbouleh, baba ghanuje, and falafel, with warm pita bread. If you order that and the mixed grill platter\u2014kafta, grilled chunks of chicken with garlic sauce, and gyro meat\u2014you\u2019ll have tried about half the menu.I\u2019m also addicted to the lebneh, strained yogurt with olive oil and mint, and especially to the sour purple pickles that come with everything when the right kind of turnips are in season. Both are made in-house.Almost everything on El Basha\u2019s menu is made on site. I didn\u2019t know that until I sat down with Vera for this piece, but I should have guessed; the salads change depending on what vegetables are in season, and when El Basha runs out of something, it\u2019s out for the day.That\u2019s her husband\u2019s doing, Vera says. Ahmad Nabulsi opened the restaurant about 20 years ago with his nephew, hoping to bring to Omaha some of the foods they loved growing up in Lebanon. Nothing made it onto the menu unless Ahmad could make it fresh. The beef shawarma is marinated and stacked right here. The hummus starts with dry beans, never canned or cooked. Ahmad has his eye on adding fresh baked goods to the menu, too, if he can find space for ovens.The restaurant belongs to Ahmad and Vera now. And it feels like a place that\u2019s loved. That\u2019s partly why people are drawn to it, I think.Inside El Basha.\nPhoto by Dana DamewoodIf you\u2019ve been coming to El Basha since the beginning, you\u2019ve followed them to a new location, you\u2019ve watched the patio grow and bloom. The dining area has gotten homier. More pictures on the walls, new tile floors, more modern tables and chairs. (Gone is the chair with the lightning-bolt tear that my son called The Chair Who Lived.) New brightly colored glass lamps, from a Turkish market in Houston, hang over the tables.If you\u2019re a regular, you get used to seeing other regulars. The restaurant is popular with nearby hospital staff and with people who work at First Data. It\u2019s also popular with various immigrant communities. Vera wonders if Ahmad\u2019s cooking reminds a lot of different people of home.\u201cMost of the people who come here, we\u2019ve known them awhile,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir kids are eating the food that their parents were eating when they were here dating.\u201dWhile we talk, one of the cooks brings us Turkish coffee and a mezza plate. The baba ghanuje is subbed out with lebneh, the way I always order it.I think about telling Vera that I can\u2019t accept free food because this time I really am writing about her, but I can hear my husband in the back of my head. \u201cEat your soup,\u201d he says.I do.Rainbow Rowell is a writer and author of many books including Eleanor & Park.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Explore Bon App\u00e9titNeighborhood RestaurantsRecipes you want to make.
