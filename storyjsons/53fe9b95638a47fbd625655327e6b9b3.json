They\u2019re consistent in flavor, texture, and sweetness, and because they\u2019re totally devoid of moisture, you can work them into baked goods like these tender doughnut muffins without fundamentally altering their structure. To get the best berry center, choose a thick jam that won\u2019t run (like Bonne Maman Intense Strawberry Fruit Spread) and take care to sandwich the batter around it. Otherwise, the jam might leak\u2014the muffins will still taste great but won\u2019t look quite as neat. \u2014Sarah JampelAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Lightly coat the cups of a standard 12-cup muffin pan with nonstick spray. Using an electric mixer on medium-low speed, beat oil, butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until smooth, about 2 minutes. Scrape down sides of bowl and beat again just to incorporate. Add eggs, increase speed to medium, and beat until incorporated, about 1 minute (mixture might look a little curdled at this point and that\u2019s okay). Add baking powder, baking soda, salt, and vanilla and beat until combined and creamy.Step 2Add flour in 3 additions, alternating with sour cream in 2 additions, beating on low speed after each addition until just combined. When last batch of flour is nearly incorporated, mix in any remaining dry bits by hand.Step 3Scoop 1 heaping Tbsp. batter into each muffin cup. Using a damp finger, flatten each into a mostly even layer with a slight dip in the center. Add 2 scant tsp. jam to each center, then divide remaining batter evenly among cups (about 2 Tbsp. each). Take care to seal in jam as much as possible. Using a damp finger, gently flatten surface. Bake muffins until golden brown, 17\u201319 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool 10 minutes in pan.CoatingStep 4While the muffins are cooling, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat; set aside.Step 5Finely grind strawberries in spice mill or with mortar and pestle. Transfer strawberry powder to a small bowl and mix in sugar and a pinch of salt. Transfer a small portion to a shallow bowl.Step 6Gently remove muffins from pan; place on wire rack and set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Brush sides of a muffin with butter and roll in strawberry sugar to coat. Brush top with butter; sprinkle with more strawberry sugar, working over bowl to catch any excess. Repeat with remaining muffins, adding more strawberry sugar to bowl as needed. (Save leftover sugar in an airtight container for another use.)Do ahead: Muffins can be made 3 days ahead. Store loosely covered at room temperature.How would you rate Strawberry Doughnut Muffins?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (6)Back to TopTriangleThe muffin recipe is delicious and crumby (I like my muffins a little crumby)! I switched it up a bit, I used freeze dried raspberries and raspberry preserve that I bought from Trader Joe's. The preserve did not leak through the bottom of the muffins. I did find the sugaring process a little difficult, and I can't help but wonder if there's a sub for the butter in that process? SKOakland, CA9/27/2021I really liked these. I\u2019ve been burned before on muffin/bun recipes with lots of steps as I am not an experienced baker. I cut the recipe in half but otherwise followed it exactly and they turned out pretty well. I liked the flavor of the donut muffin itself and the use of the freeze-dried fruit. I agree that depending on how you place the jam in, they kind of leak, but I managed to have some that were still nice looking. AnonymousSt. Paul,MN8/29/2021There were OK. I baked half of them in cupcake liners and the other half just in the tin with no liner. They all leaked a bit, so the ones in the liners looked a lot nicer. It might have been better to bake the muffins without the jam and then core and fill them. I found the dried fruit and sugar mixture tasted a bit like Koolaid mix, so I only covered the tops. That was plenty. The muffin itself tasted good -- maybe a little bland -- though I didn't get quite the cake donut-texture I expected.PeterNorthern California8/27/2021The crumb and flavor of this muffin are lovely, but I found the proportions to be a bit off in the final steps. The amount of batter I had definitely exceeded a standard 12-piece muffin tin, and I feel I needed much more butter and sugar to successfully dip all my muffins. I had raspberry jam and dehydrated raspberries, which worked nicely for a raspberry donut muffin! Strawberry would be even better though...\ndoctorsarahgPownal, VT8/23/2021They taste excellent. However, it was difficult to seal the jam. I would suggest either rolling each muffin in your moist hand before putting them in the tray or perhaps cooking down the jam a bit further so it thickens. Regardless, huge fan of this dough, I would use it to make a loaf of plain cakebread and then slice it and spread jam on it as an easier treat to make.KateWhistler, BC8/23/2021The minute I saw these muffins I had to make them just because they were so beautiful; they looked like gems. I bake for my guests at my short term rental and always do a test run. The first time I made them I followed the directions exactly and the muffins baked beautifully but I found them very messy to eat. The next time I baked them I lined the muffin tins with the paper liners and only did the tops with the sugar, much easier to eat without getting the sugar all over the place. I also added the coarser decorating sugar for some extra crunch. I felt more comfortable serving my guests something that wasn\u2019t so messy.
