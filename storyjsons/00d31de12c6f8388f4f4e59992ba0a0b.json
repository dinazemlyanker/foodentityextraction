It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.When I moved to New York a gazillion years ago, I spent a lot of time posting up bar-side at Corner Bistro in the West Village. My go-to order was the grilled chicken sandwich. Healthier than a burger, I liked to tell myself, it featured a well-marinated, juicy breast touched with a nice char, and topped with some crisp iceberg and a generous amount of mayo, all on a squishy bun.It\u2019s the kind of sandwich that feels indulgent but doesn\u2019t plunge you into a food coma (hello giant fried-chicken sandwich!). It\u2019s also the kind of thing you can, and will, make on repeat this summer, no deep fryer required.The Bon App\u00e9tit version, developed by Molly Baz, brings the grilled chicken sandwich into the 21st century. To start, it swaps breast cutlets for boneless thighs\u2014more flavor, more juiciness, more forgiving on a fiery hot grill.Like any decent grilled chicken sandwich, it relies on a marinade to imbue the meat with oomph\u2014in this case a mixture of Dijon, Worcestershire sauce (god bless, Worcestershire), garlic, and lemon juice. The key move is reserving half of the marinade to blend with mayo and cornichons for the sandwich\u2019s special sauce.Photo by Stephen Kent Johnson, Food Styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiAnd while I\u2019ll never be mad at a classic coleslaw, I really dig how Molly introduced a certain...restaurant-y sophistication with the addition of simply dressed shaved fennel.Little Gem lettuce (this century\u2019s iceberg?) offers crunch and protects the bottom bun from soaking up too much juice. And yes, the recipe calls for tomato, but I\u2019m waiting until they\u2019re in season to add a slice.Through an odd twist, my mom now lives directly across the street from Corner Bistro. I haven\u2019t been back in years for its grilled chicken sandwich. Maybe I\u2019ll take her for one this summer.Get the recipe:Grilled Chicken Sandwich with Caesar-ish DressingDeeply charred mustardy chicken thighs are paired with a crunchy and refreshing fennel-basil slaw for the ultimate summer-night chicken sandwich.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterChickenSandwichRead MorecookingThis Is Snack O'clock in the BA Test KitchenBy Adam RapoportcultureThe BA Staff Is Highly OpinionatedBy Adam RapoportcookingMake Spaghetti With Ramps Right NowBy Adam RapoportcultureBon Appe\u0301tit Used to Just Be a Magazine.
