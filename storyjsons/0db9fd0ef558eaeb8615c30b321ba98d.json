Not the plastic one, but Andy Baraghani\u2019s cousin\u2019s girlfriend who none of us know. Though in a way, all of us know her: the brave Thanksgiving newcomer. Over two decades ago, Barbie showed up to Christmas dinner with these shimmering, syrupy sweet, roasted-to-smithereens carrots that entranced the Baraghani family. And while some loves fade, others only strengthen. Which is why after the breakup, Barbie\u2019s carrots remained on the Christmas menu. A part of the family.\u201cHonestly she did sort of look like a Barbie. I was a closeted six-year-old and I was obsessed with her,\u201d Andy told me. \u201cPlus, that was the year the Barbie girl song came out.\u201d That\u2019s all the historical context you need, folks.Here\u2019s the recipe context you need: The carrots got tossed with cold pats of butter, heaps of sugar, drowned in maple syrup, and then they steam in the oven for HOURS. When served, the carrots would fall apart. In some ways this was good, for family members with sensitive teeth, but in other ways it wasn\u2019t perfect: the carrots would never take on that thick, glazy, caramel sauce.So when Andy was telling us about this dish, we knew he had to develop it for Bon App\u00e9tit, to honor Barbie, wherever she is now. This wasn\u2019t the time to go full Andy\u2014adding nuts, chiles, fistfuls of herbs, various zests\u2014but he could make the recipe technically better, and more balanced in flavor. Ultimately, it needed to be a simple roasted carrot dish, unapologetically sweet, primally satisfying. The kind of Thanksgiving side that sticks around longer than some relationships.Andy\u2019s recipe goes like this: Scrub some carrots, trim their hats, chop them into cool asymmetrical chunks or leave them artfully whole, but DEFINITELY leave them unpeeled (purely aesthetic decision). Toss them in a foil-lined baking sheet with brown sugar, maple syrup, butter, and red pepper\u2014that little bit of heat helps tone down the extreme sweetness. Instead of a long, slow roast, bake them at 400\u00b0 for around an hour\u2014tossing every 20 minutes. Tossing the carrots in the sugar-butter mixture will give them that glazed sheen that makes them irresistible. A sprinkling of flaky salt adds a bit of crunch and an Andy touch.
