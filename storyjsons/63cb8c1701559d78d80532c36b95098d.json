Yang reveal the stories behind some of the best Singaporean dishes in the hit book-turned-movie.By Alyse WhitneyAugust 30, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailSanja Bucko/Warner Bros.FacebookTwitterEmailThe premise of this summer\u2019s runaway hit movie Crazy Rich Asians is Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) flying to Singapore to meet her boyfriend Nick Young\u2019s (Henry Golding) family. But before she exchanges any awkward hugs, she\u2019s first introduced to Singaporean food. The moment after she lands, Nick and his friends, Colin (Chris Pang) and Araminta (Sonoya Mizuno), take her to eat at a hawker centre, a huge lineup of local, affordable street food stalls serving satay, chili crab, stir-fried noodles, and huge bowls of laksa curry. Little does she know that all of that food is just fuel for the drama she\u2019ll endure with his crazy-rich relatives.Nick (Golding), Colin (Pang), Araminta (Sonoya Mizuno), and Rachel (Constance Wu) at a hawker centre.\nCourtesy of Warner Bros.That scene serves as an introduction to Singapore for many moviegoers in America,  and if there\u2019s one clear takeaway, it\u2019s that you should want to eat there. The hunger pangs only grow as Rachel devours a lavish lunch of lobster, longevity noodles, and braised abalone with her friend Goh Peik Lin\u2019s (Awkwafina) family; walks through a kitchen full of decadent roast meats, salt-baked salmon, and intricate desserts at Nick\u2019s grandmother\u2019s party; and attends the wedding of the century with an endless buffet of whole suckling pigs, a shellfish display, and a literal boat full of caviar. Casual.Golding, Kwan, director Jon M. Chu, and Wu on set.\nSanja Bucko/Warner Bros.Food may be only seen for brief glimpses in the film to punctuate just how crazy rich these people are, but in the original book trilogy, written by Kevin Kwan, it\u2019s a major character. There are footnotes dedicated to explaining the origins of dishes, and detailed descriptions that make you feel like you can taste that piece of kaya toast or banana-leaf-wrapped sticky rice. To celebrate the film\u2019s incredible success over the past two weeks, we spoke to Kwan about the Singaporean dishes he holds most dear after growing up there, and the stories behind their place in the books and movie. \u201cI try to feature the greatest hits in my book, but there are so many amazing dishes that I could write a whole other book just about food,\u201d he explains. Jimmy O. Yang, who plays Nick\u2019s ridiculously over-the-top childhood friend Bernard Tai in the film, is also the guest on this week\u2019s Bon App\u00e9tit Foodcast, and shares some anecdotes from his time filming in Singapore. Listen to the full episode below, and then read more about each dish\u2019s importance in the wild, dramatic, and hungry world of Crazy Rich Asians.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.1. Hokkien Fried MeeGetty Images\u201cI\u2019m such a noodle boy. I grew up just loving noodles like you wouldn\u2019t believe, especially traditional hawker stall hokkien fried mee: thick, yellow noodles that you find only in Singapore, stir-fried with seafood, meat, and egg in this thick, brown gravy,\u201d Kwan says. \u201cFor me, that\u2019s a plate of heaven.\u201d This dish is featured in the book and movie during a whirlwind trip to Newton Hawker Centre, one of the largest in Singapore. Kwan adds: \u201cIn Singapore, the richest billionaire in the world will go to a hawker stall for the right plate of noodles. People there are so obsessively in love with food that it doesn\u2019t really matter what the surroundings are like. They\u2019ll eat in a Michelin-starred restaurant that\u2019s decorated to the hilt, or they\u2019ll go to some back alley to look for the best fish porridge in the world. The best food can be found for $3 or $300.\u201d Watch a behind-the-scenes video about hawker centre foods in Crazy Rich Asians below.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.2. Chili Crab and Hainanese Chicken RiceChristopher WiseChili crab, considered one of Singapore\u2019s national dishes, is messy to eat. It is whole cooked crab tossed with a not-actually-spicy, thick, sweet, and savory tomato-chili sauce, served with fried mantou buns (crispy Chinese steamed buns) for dipping. \u201cChili crab is great, and so are the satays and oyster omelets [at hawker stalls], but the best is Hainanese chicken rice,\u201d Yang adds, referring to the country's unassuming yet iconic dish of poached chicken over garlicky rice with chili and ginger sauces on the side. \u201cEvery stall is just a little different, and it\u2019s just wonderful.\u201d He also notes that laksa, a coconut-based noodle curry soup eaten at all times of day in Singapore, is one of his all-time favorites. \u201cI\u2019m a big noodle soup guy. My diet consists of mainly noodle soups: pho, ramen, Chinese noodles, and laksa.\u201d3. PopiahGetty ImagesIn a scene that didn\u2019t make the movie, Rachel has a popiah-making party with Peik Lin\u2019s family, which Kwan says shows how \u201ccommunal and intimate cooking can be, and how close their family is.\u201d He explains popiah as \u201cbeautiful rice pancakes that are thin and filled with various delicious things, like meat, vegetables like carrots and jicama, shrimp, egg, ground peanuts, and cilantro.\u201d Then they are rolled up like a \u201csleek little burrito,\u201d Kwan explains. \u201cYou make and eat them during a big, family-style feast. Everyone sits around a table and makes their own. There\u2019s a very special sort of sugary brown sauce that goes over it all. It\u2019s similar to hoisin sauce but it\u2019s not exactly that, and it is delicious.\u201c4. DumplingsNick (Golding) and Rachel (Wu) make dumplings in Crazy Rich Asians.\nSanja Bucko/Warner Bros.This food-centric scene features one of the most tense back-and-forths between Rachel and Nick\u2019s mother (Michelle Yeoh), but it wasn\u2019t in the original book. \u201cThe dumpling making was a surprise to me when I first read about it in one of the early scripts. They had created this scene just for Rachel to get to know the family. I thought it was very effective, quite frankly, and just a lovely moment in the movie,\u201d Kwan says. Dumpling skins were hand-rolled carefully with a dowel, and Nick teaches Rachel to put the \u201cbaby\u201d (filling) into bed (wrapper) and tuck, tuck, tuck (pleat) it in. \u201cThen you eat the baby,\u201d she jokes. Kwan says that he did not have dumpling-making parties in his Singaporean home growing up, as his family had a staff that would make everything. But he would sneak into the kitchen and run errands for the cooks as a kid, \u201clearning to fold wontons, sort through rice, and just see what happens behind the scenes.\u201d5. Kaya ToastDanielle Tsi/Getty Images\u201cKaya is a coconut jam that\u2019s infused with pandan leaves that is very popular in Singapore. It is the uni of jams. There\u2019s something so rich and decadent about it, the texture and flavor. There\u2019s a lusciousness to how smooth and yet thick it is,\u201d Kwan raves. \u201cUni is kind of sexual, in a way\u2014there\u2019s this confluence of flavors and a sensual pleasure to eating it. In a strange way, I feel the same way about kaya.\u201d Many people toast and butter their bread before spreading it with kaya to make a sandwich, and dip it in either coffee or soft-boiled eggs with soy sauce and white pepper for breakfast, but Kwan prefers things simple. \u201cI had mine on very fresh white bread, crusts cut off, spread with a thick layer of kaya. It was all I needed.\u201d Sometimes it is bright green in color from the pandan leaves, and other times it is more cream-colored\u2014both are equally delicious.6. Nyonya Kueh Pastries and Cheng TngAn assortment of nyonya keuh set out for Nick\u2019s mother\u2019s bible study group.\nCourtesy of Warner Bros.Desserts are a huge part of Crazy Rich Asians. Trays of intricate nyonya kueh (the Peranakan name for a style of bite-sized desserts) are on display at Nick\u2019s mother\u2019s bible study, at a lavish party at his grandmother\u2019s, and, of course, the blowout reception after Araminta and Colin\u2019s wedding. However, one of Kwan\u2019s favorite desserts is actually a soup. \u201cCheng tng is often found in hawker markets, and it is like shaved ice, but they pile all these different types of translucent jellies inside and on top of different toppings and flavors. But the root of it is this lovely chilled soup that is sweet and aromatic, and I think infused with longan fruit. It\u2019s subtle and beautiful\u2014it\u2019s like the Armani dress of soups.\u201d Soup, but make it fashion. Crazy Rich Asians always stays on brand.Explore Bon App\u00e9titMoviesSingaporeCelebritiesTravelRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
