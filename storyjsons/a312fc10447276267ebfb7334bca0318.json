Dividing everything between two baking sheets solves problems and creates party opportunities. You\u2019ll get the ideal ratio of ingredients layered on each tray, and if you want, you can put them into the oven at different times so that there\u2019s always a hot melty batch for your guests.Ingredients10 servings2Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil2garlic cloves, chopped1medium red onion, chopped, divided1Tbsp. achiote paste or tomato paste8ancho chiles, stemmed, seeded1chipotle chile in adobo, chopped (or 1 Tbsp. adobo sauce to keep things mild)3cups low-sodium chicken stock1tsp. ground cuminKosher salt1rotisserie chicken, meat pulled from bones and shredded210-oz. bags frozen corn, thawed, drained1poblano chile, stemmed, seeded, chopped8oz. finely grated Cotija cheese (about 2\u00bd cups), dividedNonstick vegetable oil spray28-oz. bags tortilla chips, divided2lb. sharp cheddar cheese, shredded, dividedThinly sliced radishes, cilantro leaves, and pickled jalape\u00f1os (for serving)ToppingsSour creamGrilled Salsa RojaAvocado-Tomatillo Salsa VerdePreparationStep 1Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high until shimmering. Cook garlic and half of onion, stirring occasionally, until tender and beginning to brown, 6\u20138 minutes. Stir in achiote paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until brick red, about 1 minute. Add ancho chiles, chipotle chile, stock, cumin, and 2 tsp. salt and bring to a boil. Cover, remove from heat, and let sit until chiles are very soft, about 30 minutes.Step 2Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0. Transfer chile mixture to a blender and pur\u00e9e until smooth. Return to saucepan, stir in chicken, and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat; season with salt. Remove from heat; set chicken aside until ready to assemble.Step 3Meanwhile, toss corn, poblano chile, \u00be cup Cotija cheese, and remaining onion in a medium bowl until combined; season with salt.Step 4Coat 2 large rimmed baking sheets with nonstick spray. Arrange half a bag of chips on each sheet. Top each with one-quarter of the chicken mixture, one-quarter of the corn mixture, and one-quarter of the cheddar. Repeat layers with remaining chips, chicken mixture, corn mixture, and cheddar. (Each tray will contain half of all the ingredients.)Step 5Bake nachos, rotating pans top to bottom and front to back halfway through, until cheese is melted and edges of chips are beginning to brown, 8\u201310 minutes. Serve topped with radishes, cilantro, pickled jalape\u00f1os, remaining Cotija cheese, and desired toppings alongside.Step 6Do Ahead: Nachos can be assembled 1 hour before baking. Cover with plastic and store at room temperature.How would you rate Chile Chicken Nachos?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleI've made these three times--satisfying and fun every time.AnonymousSan Francisco3/28/2020Holy cow, these are AWESOME. I forewent the radishes because I have no self-respect and am willing to eat these without getting a single fresh vegetable involved. \nNext time I'll toast the chips by themselves before layering up, in hopes of preserving more crunchiness. But, damn. Good stuff. cheterPhoenix2/4/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titNachosTex-MexAmericanMexicanLatin AmericanChipotleChileVegetableAncho ChilePoblano ChileCheddarCheeseCornCotijaMainSnackNut-FreeSuper BowlDinnerRecipes you want to make.
