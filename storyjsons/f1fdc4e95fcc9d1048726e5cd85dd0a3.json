Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,Well, it\u2019s been a week, and it\u2019s only Wednesday. Last Friday, the New York Times published a story by Julia Moskin about an NYC sommelier who\u2019d allegedly sexually abused at least four women\u2014before landing on Wine & Spirits\u2019 list of Best New Sommeliers this fall. I\u2019d been following this story\u2019s progress thanks to Healthyish columnist and Bon App\u00e9tit wine editor Marissa Ross, who played a key role in connecting Moskin with sources. Yesterday we published Ross\u2019s companion piece about how the Times story came together and where the wine industry should go from here.There's been a lot of conversation about how to prevent sexual abuse in an industry that\u2019s built on drinking. It\u2019s not as easy as saying \u201cdon\u2019t drink,\u201d or even \u201cdrink less\u201d when that\u2019s literally part of the job, and, besides, blaming alcohol just excuses the people who acted wrongly. But even focusing too much on any one individual is besides the point. The problem isn\u2019t drinking culture, it\u2019s culture, period. As Ross and others have said, we need to change the environment that's allowed this kind of behavior to go unchecked. As a first step, people in leadership positions\u2014bar and restaurant owners, winemakers, distributors\u2014have to create systems built to protect the most vulnerable among us.Now for some lighter fare: Today we launched This Is Why We Travel, our extremely specific, highly curated trip guide. We worked on it alongside Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler\u2019s Women Who Travel, and it\u2019s making me want to immediately start buying plane tickets (and this little bag). The guide is full of hyper-personal recommendations, from Katherine LaGrave\u2019s snorkeling and soba expedition in Okinawa to Zan Romanoff\u2019s dip in the mineral bath in Oaxaca to the app that makes it possible for Sandy Allen to find gender-neutral bathrooms while on the road. I hope you\u2019ll use it to inspire your own trip planning in 2020...or whenever your budget allows.Sincerely,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish EditorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletteressayRead MoreLifestyleTo Make the Wine Industry Less Toxic, We Need to Get LoudBy Marissa A.
