But Chris actually being Chris remained calm. Despite a recipe with so many iterations, so many \u201cbests\u201d in the world, so many subjective, nostalgic requirements that vary depending on the person you ask\u2014he put a newly sharpened pencil behind his ear and got to work. It ended up taking more than a week. In fact, in took months. But da Vinci could\u2019ve told us that.The goal: A chocolate chip cookie with crispy edges, gooey, chewy center, and classic flavor (vanilla and chocolate) that you can make on impulse\u2014no equipment or fancy ingredients required.The worry: \u201cLetting everyone down,\u201d said Chris. \u201cThe more iconic the dish, the more opinions there are, and the greater my fears. Nobody judges you for making a 20-minute weeknight stir fry\u2014but the most American cookie ever? Gotta watch your back.\u201dThe result: A chocolate chip cookie with crispy edges, gooey, chewy center, and classic flavor (vanilla and chocolate) that you can make on impulse\u2014no equipment or fancy ingredients required.How did he accomplish such balance, such perfection? It took nearly 30 batches, plus 10 in the cross-test phase. Here\u2019s every ingredient in the final recipe, explained.Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensThe flourIn a not-great chocolate chip cookie, you might realize the cookie tastes sort of like nothing. Or worse, like flour. Some recipes call for combinations of bread flour and pastry flour, cake flour or whole wheat, all kinds of variations that affect the texture of the cookie as well as flavor (i.e. bread flour has more protein, which can make crispier edges, but we\u2019re not gonna get into that here). Chris tried a few flour combos and ultimately didn\u2019t notice a huge advantage in the final cookies. It\u2019s a lot to ask people to buy a specialty flour (or two!), and that\u2019s not in the spirit of homemade chocolate chip cookie baking. We stuck to AP. (The ratios of other ingredients below ensure it doesn\u2019t taste like flour.) 1\u00bd cups.The saltThis was determined once we nailed the texture and flavor of the cookie based on the other ingredients (egg, sugar, butter). We wanted as much salt as possible to balance the sweetness and bring out the flavors of vanilla, chocolate, brown butter, and custardy egg yolk, without tasting salty. 1\u00bc teaspoon kosher salt.The butterOne stick is used to make brown butter, a half stick is cut into pieces and incorporated into the browned butter. Why? When we brown the butter, we cook out the water in the butter. We don\u2019t usually think about water in butter, but it\u2019s there, and it causes gluten activation a.k.a. a chewier cookie. But with 100 percent brown butter, there would be almost no gluten activation\u2014potentially creating a cookie that\u2019s all crisp, no chew. So when the brown butter\u2019s off the stove, we mix in some regular whole butter to add some water content back in, while still getting that incredible caramel, nutty brown butter flavor too. \u201cI want to taste fat. I don\u2019t want to taste straight sugar,\u201d said Chris, justifying the larger-than-usual quantity of butter in the recipe.  1\u00bd sticks.The sugarBrown sugar gives cookies their chew while the granulated stuff gives it crispy edges. We wanted both for a texture that was just on the chewier side. (A version Chris tried with all brown sugar was too much for us, so we added in that \u00bc cup of granulated.) Plus, brown sugar contains molasses, which brings a caramel, cooked-sugar taste, and its natural acidity reacts with the baking soda to carry out the cookie\u2019s leavening\u2014a.k.a. the cookie spreads in the oven and browns nicely. 1 cup dark brown sugar, \u00bc cup granulated sugar.The chocolateWe\u2019re doing chopped chocolate instead of chips. It\u2019s mostly an aesthetic choice, said Chris, because graphic, geometric chocolate chunks look more modern. \u201cA chip makes it hard to stand out in the crowd,\u201d our cookie philosopher said. It\u2019s bittersweet for its savory tendencies, its acidity and sharpness, to contrast the sweet ingredients. Plus, chopped chocolate means you\u2019ll get some shards and flecks dispersed randomly throughout the cookie for varied bites. Think about it. 6 oz, coarsely chopped.The egg + yolksEggs serve to bind the cookie, but they do more than just that. Yolk brings flavor to the table, but the egg whites don\u2019t. They\u2019re mostly water, and we\u2019ve got that covered in the butter arena. We only use one whole egg so the whites help bind, but then we crank up the number of yolks for their custardy flavor and rich texture. The white in the single egg does add a sheen to the final cookie, said Chris, who did a number of side-by-side comparisons with different egg ratios. Sheen!!! 2 large egg yolks, 1 large egg.The vanillaAn early version went with one measly teaspoon and the flavor was blah. A second teaspoon made a noticeable, delicious difference. And since vanilla is a dominant flavor in the cookie, use the good stuff. Chris likes Heilala or Neilsen-Massey. These vanillas have the heft to stand out against the bitter chocolate and dark brown sugar. A version he tried with supermarket vanilla extract faded into the background. 2 teaspoons.Everything we didn\u2019t doEverything is mixed by hand, so you don\u2019t need to pull out (and then clean) the stand mixer when you want cookies on a Tuesday.We didn\u2019t chill or \u201cage\u201d the dough overnight, because to quote Chris: \u201cWhat a freaking bummer.\u201d He tried a few, but none yielded the \u201cbest cookie in the world,\u201d so we passed.No flaky salt. \u201cI put up one version with salt on top,\u201d said Chris, \u201cand Andy Baraghani looked me dead in the eye and said, \u2018You know you can\u2019t do that, right?\u2019\u201d That\u2019s a chocolate cookie, he said, but it\u2019s not our best, the paradigm: the Toll House cookie. Visually, the bougie salt starts to tell people, \u201cMaybe you have a reason not to make this.\u201dA life lessonLook, there\u2019s going to be some variability. People have different ovens. The top and bottom rack heat differently (rotate and swap those cookie sheets mid-way!). American butter has more water and less fat than European. Baking soda expires. Kosher salt is different than iodized. Chris tried to eliminate any possible margins of error (that obsessive butter measurement!), but since this is Planet Earth, the potential to have a too-crispy cookie lurks in the atmosphere like a stray shard of chopped chocolate. During the cross-test, \u201cthere was some variability in the cookies,\u201d said Chris. \u201cBut they were all delicious.\u201dFollow the recipe, keep an eye on your oven, and believe in yourself. When the edges have browned and look crispy (this is darker cookie than a Toll House because of the brown sugar), when the tops are golden and browning, take them out of the oven to rest for 10 minutes. The best chocolate chip cookie is within your grasp.Get the recipe:BA\u2019s Best Chocolate Chip CookiesWhat makes this the best chocolate chip cookie recipe?
