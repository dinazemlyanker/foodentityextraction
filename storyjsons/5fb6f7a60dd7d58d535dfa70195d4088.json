Then I realized I\u2019d made a huge mistake. Really, I was going to cook a dish and bring it over to the house of Carla Lalli Music\u2014a woman so terrifyingly smart, so brutally funny, with a palate so sharp it might actually cut you? Where it would inevitably fall far below the standards of everything else being served and all the guests would silently mock me? I did what any rational person would do and showed up with the largest bottle of ros\u00e9 that I could find.When I arrived, Carla was in the backyard wearing a flowy caftan, effortlessly tending to squid on the grill, chatting, assembling lettuce wraps, and pouring wine seemingly simultaneously. Like probably everyone who watches Carla on YouTube, listens to her on the BA Foodcast, or follows her on Instagram, I decided\u2014in a totally-not-creepy-Single-White-Female way\u2014that my life goal was to cook like Carla. Yes, to cook the exact recipes she makes, but also to cook with the ease, unpretentious sophistication, and confidence that she emanates across all platforms (and in real life, too).Thanks to the fact that we, uh, work together, I\u2019ve had the daily opportunity to capitalize on my proximity to Carla to strive toward this goal. Carla, can I make this duck confit ahead of time? Carla, what brand are your clogs? Carla, what is the name of the restaurant in Italy where you had the pasta, you know the one I\u2019m talking about? So while I\u2019m sure that the release of her first book, Where Cooking Begins, later this month is probably exciting for her, this post is not about that: It\u2019s about why the publication of this cookbook, the creation of which I had literally nothing to do with, is such a big deal for me personally. Now, no matter whether Carla\u2019s off shooting a video in Italy or doing a guest-chef gig on her book tour, I\u2019ll have the solace of knowing she\u2019s right there\u2014on my bookshelf!\u2014to offer guidance and solutions at a moment\u2019s notice. And it means that every person who\u2019s not quite as lucky as I\u2019ve been to work alongside Carla for six years now has access to this brilliant mind and her inspired approach to cooking via these extraordinarily beautiful pages.So yeah, no shock it\u2019s our Cookbook Club pick for March! It\u2019s our Cookbook Club pick for eternity! (Jk jk, we will continue to select different cookbooks every month.)Pre-order your copy. Ask your local bookstore to stock it. Schedule your own cookbook club night. But whatever you do, don\u2019t wait to cook from this book. We\u2019ve excerpted some of the recipes from the book in our March issue, and I\u2019ve already got the Sweet Potatoes with Tahini Butter and the Seared Lamb with Marinated Halloumi on repeat. Not that that should come as a surprise.If you want to learn more about the BA Cookbook Club and how to start your own club, you\u2019ll find all that right here.Explore Bon App\u00e9titcookbook clubCookbooksRecipes you want to make.
