That\u2019s why the theme this July is Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream flavors. This isn\u2019t sponsored, there are just SO MANY FLAVORS. And you can definitely ~find yourself~ at the bottom of an empty ice cream pint. If not there, where? See which flavor is paired with your Zodiac sign below\u2014as if you needed another incentive to go out for ice cream right now.Illustration by Oscar Bolton GreenAriesYoung at heart and naturally restless, you prefer to be on the move at all times. Time has gone by waaay too fast and this month, you\u2019ll realize how much you miss that one friend. Plan as many group activities as possible this month so you can reconnect with friends, family, and old coworkers you haven\u2019t seen in awhile. Convince someone to join you for a paddleboard adventure down the river! A day filled with people you love will make you feel most at home. A day filled with outdoor activities will also make you sweaty and hungry. Grab a pint of Salted Caramel Almond\u2014creamy vanilla bean ice cream marbled with salted caramel and roasted almond slivers\u2014it\u2019s the perfect match for a go-getter like you.Illustration by Oscar Bolton GreenTaurusLately, you\u2019ve been more open to branching out of your comfort zone, well, to an extent. Like when you show up to a camping weekend with friends with a three-room tent, queen-size blow-up mattress, a Sodastream, and somehow, a wine fridge. No one is surprised, and they love you for this tendency to go all out.  And in this spirit of braving the unknown, you\u2019re going to need to try the new Glampfire Trail Mix this month\u2014chocolate ice cream swirling with gooey marshmallow and crunchy pretzel pieces. Like you, it\u2019s ambitious and just a touch extra.Illustration by Oscar Bolton GreenGeminiSometimes it\u2019s hard for you to make decisions with your mind all over the place. Looking ahead this month, you might be trying to plan your next vacation, but can\u2019t decide between a tropical (though structured) yoga retreat and a more spontaneous trip to wander Iceland and see the northern lights. As a student for life, you love traveling because you can learn experientially, but this time you\u2019ll have to decide which suits your needs better: structure or spontaneity. Encourage your split mind to unify by taking a spoon to a pint of Banana Split\u2014smooth strawberry and banana ice cream expertly blended with walnut and a double dose of fudge. Yes, this ice cream will satisfy your restless desire to try ALL the flavors in life.Illustration by Oscar Bolton GreenCancerSince you are known for your impeccable memory, it\u2019s no wonder that your birthday this month prompts you to reflect on the past year to take stock of everything you achieved. Nice 401k, by the way! Now it\u2019s time to look ahead: should you pay off that student loan, or should you buy that glittery purple jet ski instead? Decisions, decisions. You\u2019re willing to wait until something feels right. Regardless, you want to treat yourself now, and it is your birthday month. Give this new flavor a try, it\u2019s Pecan Sticky Buns\u2014brown sugar, cinnamon, and fluffy cream cheese. A mix of nostalgia and innovation, it\u2019s ideal for someone like you who prefers familiarity, but still likes to explore their options.Illustration by Oscar Bolton GreenLeoYou\u2019ll need plenty of time to clear your head this month, so hit the pavement, or the hiking trail, and walk it out. Ahh, so peaceful here. You won\u2019t be able to resist asking your hiking buddy to take a pic of you in tree pose on a giant stump. And after a few more of these requests (you can\u2019t help yourself), you\u2019ll have the perfect shots for the IG (now for the filter and caption\u2026). On your way home, pick the pint calling your name: Peanut Butter World\u2014chocolate ice cream blended with peanut butter and chocolate cookie bites. Like you, this one\u2019s personality is much more robust than its name lets on, it\u2019s a lotta flavor in a little pint, but we know you can polish it off.Illustration by Oscar Bolton GreenVirgoYou\u2019ll be feeling more antsy than usual this month, so (try to) get out of the hammock and put your running shoes on. But it might be difficult to gather motivation on your own, so sign up for something fun, like an ultimate frisbee team, or a summer pool membership. With your appetite roaring, lunge for the non-dairy Chunky Monkey. The signature swirl of banana ice cream (made with almond milk), walnuts, and fudge chips is not overly complicated or too sweet\u2014sound like anyone we know? With a tendency to be mindful of your health, you\u2019ve done the math and you reason that since it\u2019s vegan and full of potassium, it\u2019s perfectly okay to eat the entire pint for dinner.Illustration by Oscar Bolton GreenLibraYou\u2019re good at getting what you want, especially this month, when you make friends with someone who has access to a boat\u2014how convenient! And luckily, things seem to be smooth sailing for you this month. Your career will challenge you to grow, you\u2019ll spend time with friends (that boat tho), and the stress of finding a new bathing suit will be NBD, for once. While your idea of happiness may not be the same for everyone else, well, there\u2019s a pint made for everyone. For you it\u2019s Americone Dream\u2014patriotic pieces of fudge-dipped waffle cone woven in vanilla ice cream, sweet caramel and\u2026the Stephen Colbert stamp of approval. Look at you, living the dream!Illustration by Oscar Bolton GreenScorpioIn an effort to make your house more of a home, oh resourceful Scorpio, you\u2019ve been making adjustments, small and large. This month, you\u2019re going to want to get your backyard game on point\u2014you miiiight be trying to impress someone\u2014from your luscious garden, to your firepit, and your slip \u2019n slide. To cool down, go for a classic pint of Cherry Garcia\u2014tart cherry ice cream with goldmines of black cherries and fudge morsels. Let ice cream be your excuse to slow down and take a break from what feels like nonstop work; we know you don\u2019t rest easy, but that\u2019s what summer\u2019s for.Illustration by Oscar Bolton GreenSagittariusYou\u2019ve been undergoing a bit of a metamorphosis, and in this month\u2019s chapter, you\u2019ll be figuring out how to prioritize. You might choose roller-skating in short-shorts down the pier over doing your laundry (save it for a rainy day). You also might be feeling stir-crazy, TBH, and even though there\u2019s plenty of things you could do, let your impulses lead you this time. Get out and explore your town. After the sunscreen wears off, maintain your chill with a scoop of Half-Baked\u2014(partially in honor of your new tan lines) dueling chocolate and vanilla ice creams with baked brownie and cookie dough bites\u2014just what you need to keep procrastinating that laundry.Illustration by Oscar Bolton GreenCapricornYou love perusing summer street fairs; between the music, people-watching, food trucks and artist booths, you get a few solid hours of entertainment. Relationships can potentially soar to new heights this month, so plan plenty of evenings that involve tables for two, shared desserts and romanticizing over-the-top ideas together.  Don\u2019t forget to invite your partner along for a meandering walk that ends with ice cream. Split a not-so-subtle pint of Chubby Hubby. Love\u2014as is common knowledge\u2014blossoms around bites of fudge-dipped pretzels and peanut butter chunks.Illustration by Oscar Bolton GreenAquariusBlame Instagram, but you\u2019ve weirdly become more self-aware lately and might be thinking a lot about your posture, or your resting you-know-what face. You\u2019ll focus on trying to be a healthier, happier version of yourself this month (without taking away from your summer fun): grilling a ton of vegetables, getting into boxing, or diving deep into the world of foaming face masks. But don\u2019t overthink it\u2014you never get too uptight about anything. This is how you\u2019ll find yourself with a pint of FroYo Chocolate Fudge Brownie. This flavor is off the charts in chocolate (and protein) to ensure you meet those \ud83d\ude09self-care \ud83d\ude09 goals.Illustration by Oscar Bolton GreenPiscesSummer concerts, outdoor movies, and fruit-related festivals are your scene. It doesn\u2019t matter how many beers people splash in your hair because you know it\u2019ll wash out later And for you, this is what life\u2019s about: experiencing unspoken connections with others. This month, you\u2019ll feel like you can do anything\u2014crowd surf, make out with a total stranger, or get up on stage and dance (okay maybe not that far). Swim to the sidelines for a cone of Phish Food\u2014gooey swirls of marshmallow and caramel with fudge fishies\u2014a good reminder for a dreamer like you that your heart (and stomach) will rarely steer you wrong.Catherine Urban is a professional astrologer and writer who has already enjoyed several of these delicious pints throughout the writing process. work research.
