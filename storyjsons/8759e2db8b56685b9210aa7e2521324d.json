Next time I will leave it out.AnonymousNew York, NY2/5/2022Any suggestions for a replacement for the cardamom?AnonymousLong Beach, CA1/30/2022I wonder if browning the butter would bring additional flavor?  What do people think?AnonymousSeattle11/14/2021This recipe is fantastic! I've made it twice with some changes. Instead of the 6 tbsp, I browned one whole stick of butter (8 tbsp, 113g) and once the water evaporated it came out to about 85 g, which is 6 tbsp. I let it cool but didn't wait for it to solidify when whisking with sugar. I also reduced the sugar to180 g the first time (a little too sweet), then160 g the second time. You can probably reduce it a little more to 3/4 cup (150 g), but amount of sugar depends on your preferences. The second time making it, I added sliced almonds in the batter and on top, with fewer blueberries. They came out beautifully delicious each time!Mary LArlington, VA8/28/2021Needed some inspiration so I took this recipe even though we were out of saffron. We added just a bit more cardamom and really enjoyed this recipe. Nice rise to it, moist, and fantastic with your favourite drink.KeithVancouver8/8/2021This was just wonderful. We didn't eat it with the optional extra blueberries or sweetened sour cream. After making the buttercream, I heated the buttercream in a small pan with the saffron, to draw out more saffron flavor.RonPReston, VA7/22/2021Delicious and a nice change in spices from the common cinnamon etc.\nI used a combination of blueberries & other seasonal fruits. Terri Victoria BC 7/21/2021This is wonderfully simple with an amazing result. I was dubious about the cardamom and saffron, and about using frozen blueberries instead of fresh, but we were very happy with this recipe. I will go a bit lighter on the saffron next time, or just leave it out since it won't affect the bake. I rinsed the ice off the thawed berries and let them drain so as not to add additional moisture when folding them in. This cooked in exactly 50 minutes in our gas oven, had a nice rise, and came out golden brown. This goes into our dessert rotation now! Thanks, BA!Kevin RAtlanta, GA7/17/2021Really delicious and so easy to make! Crunchy on the top and super moist cake. Loved the saffron and cardamom with the blueberries.
