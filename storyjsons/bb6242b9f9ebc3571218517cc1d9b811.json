I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but it was very similar. I tossed everything with some greens to make it a salad and used red beets instead of gold. I also didn't have a lemon, so I used apple cider vinegar. Definitely would recommend -- especially if you're looking for a way to eat beets other than with goat cheese! The spices cut the sweetness and earthiness of the beets very well.
