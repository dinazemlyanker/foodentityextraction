Plus, it lasts five days in the fridge or up to a month if you freeze it.Ingredients12oz. tomatillos (about 8 medium), husks removed, rinsed, quartered, or 12 oz. tomatoes, cored, quartered\u00bdmedium avocado (optional; for making salsa verde)\u00bcmedium white onion, coarsely chopped1garlic clove1serrano chile, coarsely chopped\u00bccup (packed) cilantro leaves with tender stems1tsp.

Morton kosher salt, plus more1\u20132Tbsp. fresh lime juice (optional;  for making salsa roja)PreparationStep 1If making salsa verde, blend tomatillos, avocado, onion, garlic, chile, cilantro, and 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt in a blender on medium-low speed until salsa is smooth. Taste and season with more salt if needed.

Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt in a blender on medium-low speed until salsa is smooth.

Rick's food reminds me of home and my days growing up with my cousins in my grandma's house. I'll be \"pulling a Rick\" later today and actually freezing some - while the produce is fresh - for my winter salsa cravings. Adding the avocado to the tomatillo crudo makes for a creamier salsa, while the \"crudo\" tomatillo avoids having squishy, melty, cooked tomatillos (because they basically disappear in the oven when cooked). This is a great salsa that anyone can expand on, or eat as-is because it's perfectly simple. I would - and definitely will - make again.Allie LDenver, CO9/29/2021Thank you, RMartinez, you are a blessing! I grew up in Tucson where there is so much amazing variety of Mexican cuisine that I never learned to cook it for myself. You have revealed the secret to the salsa verde from my favorite restaurant! (La Parilla Suiza in Tucson  - alas, I am trapped in rural Oregon for the pandemic and I don't feel all that sorry for you in Mazatlan.) This tomatillo-avocado panacea is SO delicious, I drank an entire batch in one sitting, Salud, amigo!TroutappleTucson9/11/2020I rarely make my own salsa, but though it would be fun to make the salsa roja with some fresh summer tomatoes.   Totally delicious! Tasted like a perfect restaurant style salsa. Awesome with some tortilla chips. Definitely use the lime juice!
