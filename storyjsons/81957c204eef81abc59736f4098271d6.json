The chicken roasts in the spicy pickling liquid, while the potatoes cook away nestled among the bright, yellow peppers. Once the potatoes are done, just toss them together with crisp, raw vegetables for warm potato salad vibes. \u2014Grant MeltonAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Quick. More tasteful than my ex-mother-in-law.....What's not to like? Seriously! It's very good! Can't imagine changing anything about the recipe.Austin LoneStar3/1/2022I just cooked this last night.  I modified the recipe by using chicken breasts and marinating the onions and celery in a bit of the peperoncini juice beforehand.  This was very easy and tasty.  I can see coming this often on weeknights.AnonymousNYC2/20/2022Our family loved this.  It's easy, it's delicious and it's good enough for company.  You know they like it when everyone goes back for seconds.  I wouldn't change a thing.  We liked the crispy veggies on top.  MarciaOlympic Peninsula, WA2/8/2022Everything I have ever dreamed of and more! BananaicaRoanoke, VA1/30/2022Overall I liked it but I found half an onion basically raw was a bit too much for me, would cut back a bit on that next time. David PSan Francisco1/19/2022So good! This is now on my regular rotation.  I double the number pf peperoncinis and add the onions to the pan half way through cooking time so they get a little crispy and caramelized.  Omit the celery altogether, just a family preference.  Otherwise, I follow the instructions exactly. Stacey DNew Hampshire1/14/2022This was so yummy!  I always modify recipes, and did with this one too, and it was deliciious!  I used suggestions from others and will make this again, including adding more peperoncini.  It was spicy, but good for us.  These were my changes:   used  baby red, purple & white potatoes - quartered (for more browned surfaces); 2-3x more garlic (we love garlic!); twice the peperoncini & the brine; 1 thinly sliced large leek; about 1/3 lb. quartered large crimini mushrooms;  and white wine.  I tossed the leek with the potatoes, spices & oil and added to cook in the oven.  The mushrooms and purple onion I tossed with a little more oil, oregano and salt & pepper and set aside to cook after taking out the chicken.  I added about 1 cup white wine, though the flavor before was already yummy, just because we like that wine flavor.  Also, a little more brine.  Cooked enough to cook mushrooms and soften red onion.  Definately a make again. Thanks to all for the suggestions! DebbieCalif.1/7/2022I really enjoy making this but what I enjoy even more is when I serve it to my partner he absolutely raves about it he thinks so much effort and time goes into it and truly after you've made it a couple times it's really really a simple dish. Rather than removing the chicken at the end what I have found is that I take the fingerling potatoes out right before the dishes done and I put them in the frying pan I used to fry the chicken originally and get them crisped up because I had moved everything else into a nice casserole serving dish when it was in the oven. I also add just a tiny bit of chicken stock because he likes to the juices so much and I find for myself it cuts through the strong flavor as I get older I cannot handle any spice at all just none so unfortunately is one this dish is one I myself and unable to enjoy but I'm always proud of myself when I make itRyan XoDenver12/12/2021This is one of the best tasting dishes I\u2019ve ever cooked. Have made it 5+ times in the last 2 months and it never disappoints. The potatoes come out tasting more delicious than any potatoes I\u2019ve ever eaten. I have yet to find anyone who doesn\u2019t absolutely love this. Enjoy. Adam GelvanBeverly Hills, CA11/21/2021This is a bomb recipe \u2014 made it twice in less than two weeks. It\u2019s so easy and so good and damn \u2014 a winner. bobbi11/21/2021I'm making this dish for the 2nd time and each time I do it a little differently. Neither my partner nor I are big fans of celery so I omitted it. Instead I combined potatoes, carrots, sliced leeks. onions and garlic. and tossed that with Olive oil salt and pepper. Then proceeded with the recipe as written, adding a little white wine for additional flavor. At the end I sprinkled chopped parsley and chopped celery leaves over the top.  The sliced leeks were absolutely delicious in the dish and I would highly recommend using them.Scott RClearwater Fl11/17/2021Making this tonight for a second time.  so good!  I'm omitting the celery (personal preference) and adding the onion to the pan with the potatoes so they get soft and caramelized.   I'll also double the peperoncinis because my family likes them. YUM!StaceyDBedford, NH11/15/2021Absolutely delicious. Followed the recipe exactly and I was so happy with how it turned out.
