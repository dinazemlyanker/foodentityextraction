Package directions for cooking quinoa can vary across brands, so for the ultimate chewy-tender texture, we prefer to simply boil it like pasta in salted water, then drain and let it sit, covered, in the pot to steam out any excess liquid. It\u2019s worth seeking out black or red quinoa, which have an extra-firm bite.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

The recipe looks amazing, but my stomach is too sensitive for quinoa. Anonymous1/27/2022Dynamic AND Compelling! Chris Morocco has done it again! Another reviewer mentioned serving this salad with a knife - I'll counter that by saying you should leave the leaves large, put the quinoa, nuts, and cheese in the middle and eat this salad with your HANDS like little boats. Truly SO good. Bravo!Nicholas GrayGrand Rapids, MI1/23/2022Stunningly good combination. The quinoa and honey cut right through the radicchio's bitterness. If you don't tear up most of the leaves before tossing, serve with a knife.chrispbaconBrooklyn, NY1/17/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titDinnerWeeknightQuickEasyRadicchioChicoryLeafy GreensVegetableCotijaCheeseQuinoaRice & GrainsWinterSideHazelnutNutVegetarianGluten-FreeRecipes you want to make.
