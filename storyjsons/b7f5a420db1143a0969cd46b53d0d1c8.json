I scroll through my Instagram feed to see and read what my friends are thinking. Everyone is in shock. There\u2019s his salt and pepper hair atop his long, chiseled face. There are his deep, intense eyes, which, considering this morning's news, seem to carry even more weight. There he is in Chiang Mai, Thailand with chef Andy Ricker eating Laap Kao Cham Cha. There he is is drinking beer with President Obama in Vietnam. There he is, post after post, eating something, drinking something, smiling with some chef, some farmer, some person who couldn\u2019t be more happier than having their picture taken with the inimitable Anthony Bourdain. And now he\u2019s gone.I fell in love with Bourdain on April 19, 1999. That\u2019s when his now legendary article \u201cDon\u2019t Eat Before Reading This\u201d appeared in The New Yorker and rocked the food world. Had anyone ever been so honest about what really happens at restaurants? I still have a hard time eating fish on Mondays because of what he wrote, despite the fact that he even updated his stance many years later. That article was the foundation for the groundbreaking Kitchen Confidential, the book that made restaurants and working in them cool. That book changed people\u2019s lives. It made Bourdain an everyday hero who understood what it was like to spend 16 hours a day cooking. I wanted to be like Bourdain. I would hang out at Les Halles, a bistro on Park Avenue in New York City, eating steak au poivre and French fries and drinking Malbec hoping to catch of the glimpse of the man with the handkerchief tied around his neck.In the following years, I shared a few meals with Bourdain. I interviewed him a few times for stories and would text him with random thoughts or opinions. He always had an opinion and he always made time for people, even as his star rose with No Reservations on The Travel Channel and Parts Unknown on CNN. He wasn\u2019t just a food industry idol anymore; the public had adopted him as their guide who would open windows into cultures that they themselves might never have the chance to experience firsthand. Bourdain made eating unfamiliar food cool. Eat first and ask questions later was his philosophy. Be fearless and always carry a fork or pair of chopsticks. He made traveling to far off lands and seeking out authentic experiences the only way to travel. When Bourdain featured a restaurant on one of his shows, it would be packed the next day and every day after that. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve been sitting at a bar or restaurant and someone would come up to me and say, \u201cThat\u2019s where Tony sat when he was here.\u201dTony. That\u2019s what most people would call him after just one face-to-face encounter. That\u2019s because through his writing, his words, and his shows, Bourdain felt like your best buddy. He was unpretentious and open to whatever landed on his plate or in his cup or who he came in contact with. He was as quick to share a shitty beer in a styrofoam cup as he was a fancy-ass glass of bubbly. He could go high and he could go low. But no matter what it was, he did it with respect and class. I wanted to be like Tony. Everyone wanted to be like Tony. Even when he teased me, calling me Breck Boy because of my long hair on Iron Chef America, I felt flattered just that he noticed.A few years back after taping a video for Bon App\u00e9tit along with his pal Eric Ripert at Le Bernardin, Bourdain and I stepped outside on 51st Street for some fresh air. It was 10 in the morning but we were both sipping mezcal (Ripert made us do it!). Who knows what time zone his head was in. We talked for a half hour about fried chicken, our favorite pizza spots, and Norwegian black metal. Find the things that make you happy and do more of that, he told me toward the end of the conversation.I don\u2019t pretend to have known Tony as much as other folks in the business, but I\u2019d like to think that he was happiest when he was sitting at some table in some corner of the world drinking and eating with friends old and new. That\u2019s how I will choose to remember him.I hope he knows how many people\u2019s lives he transformed. Some people change the world through art, some through music and politics. Tony did it through food. The world is a less intriguing and less delicious place today now that he is gone. Tonight\u2019s dinner and bottle of wine is for you, Tony.How Anthony Bourdain Came to Be Anthony BourdainAnthony Bourdain grew up to be one of the world's most adventurous (and opinionated) eaters. Here, he credits his father for the man he became.View StoryExplore Bon App\u00e9titAnthony BourdainRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
