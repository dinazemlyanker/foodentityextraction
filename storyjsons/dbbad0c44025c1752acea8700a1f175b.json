Cover with plastic and let batter rest 15 minutes.Step 4Meanwhile, chop 1 oz. chocolate and transfer to a small saucepan. Add \u00bc cup cream and cook over low heat, whisking often, until chocolate is melted and mixture is completely smooth; season with a pinch of salt. Keep warm over low heat.Step 5Remove skillet from oven and add 1 Tbsp. butter; swirl skillet to melt, making sure to coat entire bottom and sides of skillet.Step 6Give batter a quick whisk to reincorporate, then pour into skillet.

Remove skillet from oven (watch for that handle again) and let rest about 2 minutes. The pancake will immediately begin to fall, but that\u2019s normal.

Did I miss a step?deb1bakerNorfolk VA4/21/2021Very good and very easy. Too dark for a couple of my kids, but that's how I like it, so that's how I made it! \ud83d\ude01 I don't have an oven safe skillet so I used an 8x8 glass pan instead. I could get 9 servings from it. kwood8Midwest9/19/2018This dessert was delicious and easy! Made no adjustments, even though the salt scared me a little. Could easily serve 2-4 people, especially with added scoops of ice cream.AnonymousNew York2/15/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titPancakeDessertChocolateOther IngredientsEasyNut-FreeBakingBreakfastBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
