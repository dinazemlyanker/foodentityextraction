A touch screen air fryer that\u2019s slightly too big for my New York kitchen countertop? Have it. A galactic 1250-watt microwave that heats up food almost too quickly? Yep, I impulse-bought that during quarantine too. But one thing I\u2019ll never get fancy with is my shaved ice machine. I grew up prepping big batches of fluffy ice for halo-halo with my siblings, and whether in my mom\u2019s or my auntie\u2019s kitchen, I can\u2019t remember a time that we used anything other than a hand-operated machine to get the job done. Even though I\u2019m now an adult who loves a gadget with bells and whistles, I\u2019ll never replace my Manba manual shaved ice machine\u2014which I use not only for halo-halo but also for spiked slushies\u2014with an electric one.MANBA Ice Shaver and Snow Cone Machine$32 $24 at AmazonAssembling halo-halo is objectively fun\u2014alternating layers of sweet red beans with coconut gel, jackfruit, and ube ice cream in a tall glass\u2014but, to me, cranking the handle and watching the shards of ice fall takes me right back to childhood. At family cookouts, making shaved ice never felt like work to us kids because the machine was almost like a toy. We\u2019d take it outside on the porch and fight over whose turn it was to work the crank, motivated by the knowledge that the more shaved ice we made, the more halo-halo we got to eat.But the ice shaver I used when I was younger had its drawbacks. It required big ice cylinders, so we\u2019d have to plan ahead and make sure to fill the molds the day before. Sometimes I\u2019d be hit by a halo-halo craving only to find we didn\u2019t have ice blocks prepared\u2014a particular kind of torture. That\u2019s never an issue with the Manba because it can be filled with regular ice cubes (a silicone ice tray is even included). Another plus is that it\u2019s so compact. At about six inches tall and five inches wide, it\u2019s the perfect size for anyone\u2014cough, cough, me\u2014who finds themselves making a single serving of halo-halo on any given Tuesday. Despite its petite size, it has a sturdy build and is capable of crushing a cup of ice cubes into delicate, snow-like fluff in 30 seconds flat, minimal elbow grease required.With my own shaved ice machine, I can cool down with a glass of halo-halo any time the temperature breaks 85 degrees. But it\u2019s so easy to use, clean, and store that I\u2019ve also started using it for all of my summertime drinks. There\u2019s nothing that makes you feel like you\u2019ve really earned that lime-lemongrass slushy or strawberry fros\u00e9 like hand-cranking your own crushed ice.Related:Halo-HaloThe Filipino dessert layers shaved ice and condensed milk on top of all sorts of texturally contrasting ingredients for a deliciously chewy, crunchy, creamy, sticky, and refreshing result.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make.
