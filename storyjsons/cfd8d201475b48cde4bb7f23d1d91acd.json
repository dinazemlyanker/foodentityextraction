And the newly redesigned Spago, from the moment you toss your keys to the valet to the moment you stagger back out again, gives good bubble.\"If you are lucky enough to have made a living as a food writer these past several years, you've spent many hours reading Jonathan Gold, shaking your head with a dumb grin.Gold, the LA Times food critic who passed away yesterday at age 57 from pancreatic cancer, was the kind of writer who fellow food writers weren\u2019t jealous of\u2014they just loved to read him. No hating; just admiration. He won a Pulitzer in 2007 and was nominated again in 2011, and we all knew he deserved it. He wrote in a way that so many of us simply couldn\u2019t.\u201cSoft-serve cocoon of illusion\u201d...\u201cGives good bubble.\u201dAre you kidding me?! I would've paid my own way at dinner to have written those lines.But when Gold reviewed Wolfgang Puck\u2019s iconic Spago in 2012 for the LA Times, that was just Gold being Gold.And his lede paragraph led only to even more choice lines:\"The thick prime rib steak sings with the flavors of blood, age and char; the tagliatelle with white truffles perfumes half the observable universe when its glass dome is whisked away. Sommeliers beam at the brilliance of your wine selection as if it weren't the sixth bottle of that Austrian Riesling they'd sold that evening. There is important art on the walls, including a photograph of a shattered cellphone the size of Pau Gasol, and a painting you could swear you saw at an Ed Ruscha retrospective, and while the music may tend toward the sort of '80s rock your meathead younger brother may have stashed on his iPod, at least you are not picking at your hearts of palm salad to the beat of hotel-lobby electronica.\"When he wanted to, Gold could drill down on the details of a dish and its ingredients, satisfying nitpicking food-industry types and proving his bona fides. But he could also name check a seven-foot Lakers\u2019 power forward and LA\u2019s most famous living artist in the same sentence, engaging his millions of readers in a way his competition couldn\u2019t.Back in the 2000s, when I was an editor at GQ, I asked Gold to write a short piece for a package on restaurants around the world that were worth flying for. At the time, he was writing a monthly restaurant review column for Gourmet, where his wife Laurie Ochoa was executive editor. I was warned by pretty much everyone, including Laurie, that I would either never get the text or that it would come in so late I\u2019d have to hand deliver it to our printing plant down in Kentucky.Sure enough, after several trying-not-to-sound-panicky emails to Ochoa, Gold\u2019s piece on a trattoria in the hills of Italy arrived at the 11th and a half hour.We shipped it immediately, as it was. It didn\u2019t need any editing.See more: Jonathan Gold Is the Reason I Write About FoodRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
