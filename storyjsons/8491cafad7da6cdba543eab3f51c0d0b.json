When April finally rolls around, the weather is somehow never as good as I imagined it would be, but there are snap peas at the farmers\u2019 market. So when the forecast shows a full week of rain, there\u2019s only one thing to cook: a fresh, vegetable-packed spring minestrone.Normally I'd argue that spring soup feels too much like settling. (Isn\u2019t winter just four months of eating stew?) But senior food editor Andy Baraghani decided to create a bright but light broth that feels seasonally on point.He starts by saut\u00e9ing garlic with ground pepper, coriander seeds, and fennel seeds, then adds scallions, half a serrano chile, and a few strips of lemon zest for an extra hit of brightness. Then, when the scallions are softened and slightly charred, he adds six cups of water to get a broth going. It\u2019s the perfect cooking liquid for all leeks, snap peas, and cannellini beans.It also helps that the vegetables are simmered until just tender\u2014not cooked to death like other soups that shall go unnamed. Seriously, I spent more time trimming peas and washing leeks than standing over the stove. The secret is to get all your chopping out of the way before turning on the stove, then strategically add ingredients based on how long they need to cook. So once the sturdier fennel and peas are almost tender, add the baby spinach and English peas along with a tablespoon of white miso to round out the broth. The result is a spring minestrone that's full of texture, with slightly crunchy snap peas, soft whisps of wilted spinach, and creamy miso-y beans.The vegetables shrink as they cook, but this recipe still hits high on the broth to mix-ins ratio. The final soup is like an entire farmers' market in one pot. And while there\u2019s already a lot of green in your bowl, I recommend topping with chopped fennel fronds for maximum spring vibes. Think of this recipe like your go-to spring jacket\u2014colorful enough to feel fresh but cozy enough to keep you warm until the clouds clear for good.It's (still) soup season:Spring MinestroneWith leeks, fennel, sugar snap peas, and English peas, this soup is perfect for ushering in spring.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSpringSoupVegetarianSugar Snap PeaLeekRead MoreLifestyleBrothy Pasta With Chickpeas Are Like Healthyish Spaghetti-OsBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
