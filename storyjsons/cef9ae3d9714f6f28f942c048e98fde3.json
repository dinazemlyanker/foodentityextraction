Gochugaru has a sweet, bright pepper flavor and is much less spicy than your run-of-the-mill crushed red pepper flakes, so you can use a lot.Ingredients4 servings1Tbsp. grapeseed or extra-virgin olive oil\u00bdsmall onion, finely chopped2scallions, white and pale green parts only, thinly sliced2garlic cloves, finely chopped\u00bdcup chopped Napa cabbage kimchi with juices3Tbsp. gochugaru (coarse Korean hot pepper flakes)3Tbsp. soy sauce114-oz. package silken tofu8large shrimp, peeled, deveined4oz. squid, bodies and tentacles separated, bodies cut into \u00bc\"-thick rings8mussels (5\u20135\u00bd oz.), scrubbed, debeardedKosher salt or fish sauce1large egg yolk*Cooked rice (for serving)PreparationStep 1Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium. Add onion, scallions, and garlic and cook, stirring often, until vegetables are very soft but not browned, 8\u201310 minutes. Add kimchi and juices and cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute (just to concentrate the flavor). Add gochugaru, soy sauce, and 2 cups water. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Cook just until flavors come together, about 5 minutes.Step 2Add tofu (try to keep it in one piece; using a big spoon is an easy way to remove it from the package), then surround with shrimp and squid, and finish with mussels. Cover and cook just until shrimp are opaque and mussels open, about 2 minutes. (Try to avoid stirring so tofu doesn\u2019t break up.)Step 3Remove stew from heat; taste and season with salt or fish sauce if needed. Top with egg yolk just before serving. Serve with rice alongside.Step 4*Raw egg is not recommended for the elderly, pregnant women, children under four, and people with weakened immune systems.How would you rate Soondubu (Spicy Soft Tofu and Seafood Stew)?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleThis is a great recipe! Tastes authentic and very easy and straightforward to make. Only adjustment for me is that i cut down soy sauce to 1 tbsp and add 1tbsp of fish sauce. Less salty and less soy sauce flavor which i enjoy. \nAnonymous7/7/2020Why are there no other reviews of this yet?! This recipe is quite simply amazing. Have I made it properly yet? No. But the fact it\u2019s good even with a few substitutions is a sign - and the sign says \u2018You should make this!\u2019. Couldn\u2019t find gochugaru so substituted 1 TBSP of dried finger chilli flakes the first time, and 1 TBSP regular chilli flakes the second time I made this. Both delicious. I also didn\u2019t have quite the range of seafood - but just prawns was delicious, and Korean seafood dumplings was also a great substitute. Plus or minus tofu, it\u2019s all good.
