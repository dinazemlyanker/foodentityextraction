Let sit 15 minutes.Step 2Heat oil in a medium skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high. Cook steak, undisturbed, until a deep golden brown crust forms underneath, about 3 minutes. Turn over and repeat on second side until browned, about 3 minutes. If steak has a fat cap, stand it on its side with tongs and cook until browned, about 3 minutes (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part should register 120\u00b0 for medium-rare). Transfer to a cutting board; let rest 15 minutes. Slice steak against the grain \u215b\"\u2013\u00bc\" thick.Step 3Working with 1 skewer at a time, thread skewer through a strip of steak near a short end. Slide a cube of cheese, then a piece of cherry pepper onto skewer. Thread opposite side of steak onto skewer to close. Push steak, cheese, and cherry pepper snugly against one another to form a compact bundle situated toward the tip of the skewer.Step 4Arrange skewers on a large plate. Drizzle with oil and sprinkle with sea salt and black pepper.How would you rate Peppery Antipasto Skewers?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleExcellent recipe -- fast, easy, tasty, classy. I served it alongside a big salad of greens dressed in a simple vinaigrette. \n\nAddressing another review on here: the recipe states 'lay the steak flat and slice horizonatly (sp)' exactly nowhere. Trolling the comment section for a recipe on an excellent site? Sad indeed.ElenaUSA2/14/2022The people that say slice against the grain should learn what  that means and what the grain is in this recipie they are saying lay the steak flat and slice horizonatly a very dangerous thing .   The grain  on this and most steaks is vertical  , why would anyone that has ever cooked a steak need to be told this . This destroyed any credibility in my mind of your web site  sad ...
