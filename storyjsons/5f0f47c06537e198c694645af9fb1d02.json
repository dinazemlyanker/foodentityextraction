I can\u2019t be bothered to eat a dessert that isn\u2019t visually begging for my attention. I\u2019m looking at you, humble loaf cakes. Unless you\u2019re a sweet potato brick piled high with swoops of meringue or banana bread topped with caramelized banana slices, I\u2019m not giving you the time of day.But then my best friend\u2019s parents gifted me this Nordic Ware Harvest Bounty Loaf Pan and all too adorably requested that I bake something beautiful in it. I couldn\u2019t deny that the pan itself was a stunner\u2014its figure embossed with a whimsical array of plump pumpkins and little acorns so dainty that I began to empathize with squirrels. But would the pan\u2019s festive features be enough to elevate a loaf cake into something wow worthy?Harvest Bounty Loaf Pan$38 $25 at Amazon$36 at TargetI made a basic chocolate cake batter and poured it into my barely oiled loaf pan. And like a Disney movie makeover montage, the Harvest Bounty baking pan transformed my bare-bones chocolate cake into a breathtaking autumnal vision. The edible flowers I had on standby? Not necessary. Huge shout out to Nordic Ware\u2019s PFOA-free (no nasties) nonstick coating\u2014not a corner nor crumb of the cake stuck to the pan\u2019s many nooks and crannies. We\u2019d have a much homelier, less cute cake without it.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.One lovely loaf cake later, I wish I could say that I\u2019ve learned my lesson about judging a cake by its cover. But really all I\u2019ve learned is that banana breads deserve a second chance in my shiny new Harvest Bounty Loaf Pan.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make.
