It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Scary stories to stream in the darkRestaurant editor Elyse Inamine turned around in her desk and propped her chin on my cubicle wall. \u201cHave you been listening to \u2018Dr. Death\u2019???\u201d She asked. NO, I have not! But she knew the real life horror story of a Dallas neurosurgeon\u2019s evil practices was right up my alley. I\u2019ve been reading softened paperback Louise Penny murder mysteries from the library but I will take a break and check it out soon, I promised. This spiraled into a discussion of everything the staff was consuming other than food, and it turns out we\u2019re all in a dark place right now:Associate editor Alex Delany: Watched ALL of Maniac on Netflix in one rainy day.\nAssociate ed Alyse Whitney: Highly recommends This Is Us, Season 3.\nDigital director Carey Polis: Is watching Forever on Amazon.\nAssociate ed Hilary Cadigan: Is reading There, There by Tommy Orange. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating but everyone should read it,\u201d is her review.\nHealthyish ed Amanda Shapiro: Is reading Ottessa Moshfegh\u2019s My Year of Rest and Relaxation. \u201cIt\u2019s really dark,\u201d she admitted.\nBasically ed Amiel Stanek: Has gotten into \u2018Bundyville,\u2019 which is a podcast on exactly what you think. It \u201cgets really weird,\u201d he added.\nFood director Carla Lalli Music: Is rabidly listening to Slate\u2019s podcast, \u2018Slow Burn,\u2019 about the impeachment of Bill Clinton, on her commute.Photo by Alex BeggsBut in between all of this culture, we\u2019re still cooking. Last weekend I grilled the cover story from our June/July issue, Andy Baraghani\u2019s short ribs. I got a few packs of Korean-style short ribs from Applestone butcher (where you can buy meat from a vending machine\u2014cool), and was ready for a challenge. I was wrong! The magazine photo looked like a Dutch masters still life, dappled in metaphoric and literal sunlight, so I assumed the recipe was complicated...but it was a cinch! A blender marinade of chile pepper, lemongrass (I didn\u2019t have), garlic, ginger, sesame oil, rice vinegar, brown sugar, and oil, and then the ribs hit the grill for 2-4 minutes. The heat from the jalape\u00f1o nearly disappeared after grilling, leaving these juicy, flavorful short ribs that I wanted to eat by the stack, like pancakes. The final step was cutting some daikon radish, the most suggestive shape at the farmers\u2019 market, and tossing it in a little rice vin. And that was hilariously simple too. I\u2019ll definitely make this again\u2014if not just the marinade. It\u2019s fall grilling season, people!Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!America runs on brevityThis week, the artist formerly known as Dunkin\u2019 Donuts dropped its last name. The company is now simply Dunkin\u2019. They serve coffee beverages and round wheels of fried dough frosted in sugar, whatever those are. I wondered who this change poses the biggest challenge for, and I\u2019ve landed on the sign guys. Overworked sign guys across the country put the newspaper down and groaned: Nooooooo! Blast it all! Criminy! (They\u2019re British.) The week ahead looks rough. So many signs to remove. And where will all those banished \u201cDonuts\u201d go? I for one will be checking Craigslist.Broccoli makes a comebackThere are some truths we hold to be self-evident based on Instagram statistics: People love pizza, saucy wontons, seared scallops, glossy pasta...and broccoli? This week we posted some amazing new recipes, like creamy spaghetti al limone and crispy glazed brussels sprouts, but this photo of roasted broccoli and hot honey-ricotta toast garnered nearly 600 comments. Remember that New Yorker cartoon about the kid eating broccoli: \u201cI say it\u2019s spinach and to hell with it!\u201d? Apparently people LOVE broccoli now. If that cartoon was redrawn today, what would it be? I think \u201ckale.\u201dUser Daniellewachtler tags her friend and lights a match: \u201cOmg we need this @jross1118 hot honeyyy \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\u201dJewelofcana literally makes an entirely different recipe but her heart is in the right place: \u201cI\u2019ve made this exact recipe without the broccoli, with the obvious addition of prosciutto & arugula. Absolutely delicious. GOOD CALL, BA.\u201dI love the way @johey uses the comments as an opportunity to check in with sweet hippo feet (!!) on the grocery situation at home: \u201c@sweet_hippo_feet do we have a good amount of broccoli left? I wanna pick up some ricotta and a baguette to make this tonight!\u201dPICK IT UP, SWEET HIPPO FEET!One person saw it on Instagram, went to the store, and MADE the recipe all within the span of a few hours. This was definitely a record:MeanwhileVia @tinygentleasiansNew friendsIt was Sasha Levine\u2019s first week at Bon App\u00e9tit, replacing yours truly as senior editor on BA.com while I move over to write for BA full-time and really apply myself to this newsletter. I asked Sasha how it went: \u201cEveryone is concerned about rebranding my office\u201d\u2014which was previously labeled \u201cThe Panic Room,\u201d she told me. \u201cPeople have brought my various lamps and lightbulbs to help with the lighting.\u201d What did she think of her new coworkers? \u201cAmiel threatened to lick the salt lamp, but other than that, everyone\u2019s been really nice. Too nice.\u201d Awww!UpdateLoup reopened! I love a good resurrection story.Unnecessary food feud of the weekAfter all of the holiday issues, the food team is in January resolution mode, mentally. And this week, Andy has been making six, that\u2019s right, six*, scrambled eggs for breakfast every day. This prompted the debate: Do you salt your scrambled eggs when you whisk them, or after, when they\u2019re on the plate? Andy salts before. \u201cNeither,\u201d whispered Christina Chaey, who has a thing about eggs I\u2019ll never understand. Food editors Anna Stockwell and Kat Boytsova salt after, for some reason. Emma Wartzman salts before and then whisks in some cream cheese after (!!!). But I\u2019ll let egg-obsessed Adam Rapoport have the last word: \u201cA) Chaey is cray. B) I think you gotta salt a little bit while whisking, and then finish with flaky salt when done. It's definitely not enough to just sprinkle with salt after they're plated, because the salt just rests atop the eggs and doesn't infuse them with flavor. I've kvetched about this a zillion times, but nothing worse than unseasoned scrambled eggs. Bland and rubbery and, ultimately, flavorless.\u201d*He\u2019s trying to bulk up. \u201cAfter the fourth egg, it gets difficult to eat anymore,\u201d he told me while pulling a seeded loaf for Healthyish out of the oven. \u201cHis biceps don\u2019t lie,\u201d Carla added.Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRecipes you want to make.
