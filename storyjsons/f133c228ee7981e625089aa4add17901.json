I add it to everything\u2014scrambled eggs, French fries, chicken salad. What can I say? I live for the spice. Which is why, naturally, I\u2019m into all the Sichuan peppercorn-laced things at Hop Alley in Denver.There\u2019s the numbingly hot fried chicken; pork dumplings swimming in fiery chile oil that cures any summer sniffles; and the dan dan mian, noodles tossed with tingly-spicy ground pork. But the thing I actually loved the most at this restaurant wasn\u2019t any of the above. It was the decidedly not spicy chilled tofu dish.It\u2019s a thing of beauty. Silken tofu, sliced and shingled out like a hand of playing cards, is smothered in bang-bang sauce, an addictive mixture of sesame paste, chile oil, sugar, Chinese black vinegar, and soy sauce. On top of that, smashed cucumbers, peanuts, poppy seeds, flaky salt, and cilantro are piled on. Everything works together in perfect harmony: the crisp, watery cucumbers offsetting the salty peanuts; the crunchy toppings balancing the custardy consistency of the silken tofu. It\u2019s exactly the calm, cool rest stop my runny nose and watery eyes need in the middle of my heat-seeking journey.But before you go on thinking I can\u2019t take the heat, I should say that there is just a tiny bit of chile flakes in there. Not too muchl just enough to keep me coming back again and again. Like I told you: I can\u2019t get away from the spice life.Go there: Hop AlleyExplore Bon App\u00e9titDenverHighly RecommendRestaurantsRead MorerestaurantsVenezuelan Sticky Buns > Regular Sticky Buns, Always and ForeverBy Amiel StanekRecipes you want to make.
