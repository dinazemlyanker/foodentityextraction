Have a question? Email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.\u201cIf, during your meal, one dish came with hair in it, another had a piece of plastic in it, everything else was delicious, and all they comped was giving us more dessert\u2014should I have demanded the whole thing to be comped?\u201d \u2014Dissatisfied DevinLet me get this straight, you found a hair, some plastic, but then went ahead and ordered dessert? It sounds like you have forgiveness in your heart. It\u2019s 2019\u2014no one forgives anymore. We rage! We avenge! Your soul remains pure. And yet, that extra dessert shows up and you think, could it be more? This is how paradise fell. Sure, they could have comped the entire meal and your three glasses of Sauv Blanc on ice, but restaurants barely make a profit these days and you clearly walked into a struggling one. You get an entire meal free when the treasure discovered on your plate was once living, breathing, and pooping. That\u2019s the one. So take your extra bowl of definitely-sneezed-on-gelato, and never go back to that place again.Spotless!\nPhoto by Alex Lau\u201cHere\u2019s a restaurant bathroom scenario: I am a dude. I\u2019m waiting in line to use the only restroom at a restaurant. There\u2019s another dude in there. And there\u2019s a woman behind me in line. When it\u2019s my turn, I see that the dude has left some pee on the seat. I\u2019m not going to sit in it, but the woman behind me in line will have to deal with it. And she\u2019ll probably think it was me who peed on the seat. I obviously can\u2019t say to this woman, \u2018That\u2019s...not my pee on the seat,\u2019 but I also don\u2019t want to clean that dude\u2019s pee off of a toilet seat before I head back to dinner. Is this a Gandhi-ish \u2018Be the change, yadda, yadda, yadda,\u2019 situation? Or is it the woman\u2019s problem, and I just happen to be caught in the crossfire? WHO CLEANS THE PEE?\u201d \u2014A Different AlexThe ladies\u2019 room in our office has an overstuffed paper towel dispenser that causes people to pull too many towels. By the afternoon, the floor of the ladies room is littered with them, plus used, wet towels people flung into the can and missed. This used to drive me crazy. Who are these grotesque goblins I work and pee beside? But then I realized. I\u2019m Mother Theresa. I\u2019m Princess Diana. I\u2019m a freaking saint. So now, I use the towel I dried my hands with to pick up those stranger germ towels and make sure that society doesn\u2019t crumble into the landfill where all these towels are going. Wipe the pee. Wash your hands.SNACK BREAKThe creamy ricotta up against crispy broccoli up against spicy honey\u2014YOU WANT THIS TOAST. For a dinner party snack on baguette, or on sourdough toast for dinner. So versatile!Broccoli and Garlic-Ricotta Toasts with Hot HoneyCrispy roasted broccoli proves it works just as well as an appetizer as it does a side dish.View Recipe\u201cWhen splitting the check with a friend, are you obligated to discuss how much you\u2019re tipping and then synchronize your totals?\u201d \u2014Gossipy GinaSure, why not? Then I always tip an extra dollar so the server likes me best.\u201cIs it ever okay to call out a mansplaining waiter/bartender who questions if I really want my drink order? I pretty much exclusively drink mezcal, and get questions about if I \u2018know it will be smoky\u2019 or \u2018have had mezcal before.\u2019 And yep, they\u2019re always from dudes. I may look young and femme, but I know what I want to drink!\u201d \u2014Alcy AlizaI prefer tequila. But when they ask if you know it\u2019ll be smoky say, \u201cyes, I know many, [LONG PAUSE] many things\u201d and do NOT break eye contact and do not smirk.When they ask if you\u2019ve had mezcal before, look off dreamily and say, \u201cyes, we drank mezcal at the commune on sacrifice days.\u201dPhoto by Hulton Archive/Getty Images\u201cI ordered a pork chop at a pretty fancy restaurant lately that arrived raw. When I pointed it out to the waiter, who agreed it was undercooked, she asked if I wanted the chef to put it back on the grill. I thought they\u2019d just cook a new one, so instead I asked for an entirely different dish. Is that okay?\u201d \u2014Raw RachelYeah that was a good idea. Do that.That\u2019s all for now, but if you have petty etiquette questions or recipe requests for me, email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com and be too specific. I want the juicy details!Love, AlexExplore Bon App\u00e9titIs It Ever OkayEtiquetteRestaurantsRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
