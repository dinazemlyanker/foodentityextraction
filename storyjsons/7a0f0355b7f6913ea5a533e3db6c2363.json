It hits my palate like a Mexican mole and adds complexity to even simple dishes like this quick saut\u00e9ed shrimp.\u201d Toasting and grinding the spices in this warming blend unlocks all of their flavor. This recipe yields a lot, but you won\u2019t have any trouble finding other uses for it: When you\u2019re sweating aromatics for a braise, stir in a couple spoonfuls of relajo, turn it into a rub for grilled meats, or add a few big pinches to freshly fried potatoes.IngredientsMakes about 1\u00bd cups4medium pasilla chiles, seeds removed, torn into 1\" pieces6star anise pods43\" cinnamon sticks4dried bay leaves\u00bccup coriander seeds\u00bccup dried oregano\u00bccup raw pumpkin seeds (pepitas)3Tbsp. sesame seeds2Tbsp. cacao nibs or \u00bc cup (scant) unsweetened dark cocoa powder2Tbsp. cumin seeds1Tbsp. achiote (annatto) seeds or 2 tsp. powderPreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 325\u00b0. Scatter chiles, star anise, cinnamon sticks, bay leaves, coriander seeds, oregano, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, cacao nibs, cumin seeds, and achiote seeds on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and bake until lightly browned and chiles are crisp, 18\u201322 minutes. Let cool.Step 2Transfer chile mixture to a blender and blend on high until finely ground, about 1 minute (be careful not to overprocess; you don\u2019t want it to turn into a paste).Step 3Do ahead: Relajo can be made 1 month ahead.

I can\u2019t wait to use in my panes con pavo recipe. Silvia D.Naples, FL1/4/2022Delicious! I can think of so many uses for this. For those who bought fresh chiles, dried chiles often have a different name than their fresh counterpart.  To get a Pasilla chile you need to dry a fresh, green Chilaca chile. Pasilla chiles are always dried.DZMichigan11/19/2020You should specify DRIED pasilla chiles.  I see someone else had the same issue. Kind of a drag after buying all those ingredients.TMAltadena, CA11/8/2020Let's also talk about raw pumpkin seeds. Do you mean raw from the pumpkin, or plain dried ones?\n\nThanksSBBoise11/6/2020This is a truly amazing spice mixture. I substituted dried arbol chilies and cacao powder and it was perfect. Origionally made it for Pollo en Chicha which is truly amazing but now I cannot wait to use this with pulled pork en chicha and oh so many other dishes. Glad it made a lot.AnonymousSouth Carolina10/18/2020When I read through this recipe, I thought it was weird that the chiles would get crispy at 325 degrees for that short of a roasting time.  Of course I used fresh chiles as the recipe didn't specify dried ones.  Obviously, that is what was intended because the chiles NEVER got crispy, even after I separated them out from the rest and roasted them at 450 for 30 minutes.  The flavor was good though.  Please alter the recipe to reflect what kind of chiles should be used.  Thank you!\nAnonymousUSA10/15/2020I\u2019m knee deep in this \u2018relajo\u2019 only to realize these probably should have been dried pasilla. WHY IS IT NOT IN THE RECIPE!?!?!? So now my relajo is going to be turned in to mole paste..
