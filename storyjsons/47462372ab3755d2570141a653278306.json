It should be salty like the sea\u2026except when it shouldn\u2019t be. And don\u2019t forget that some salts are saltier than others, so pay attention when you\u2019re using sea salt, as opposed to kosher salt. Confused yet? I know I am\u2014I\u2019ve made my fair share of bland pasta and too salty beans. But no matter how many times I screw up dinner by miscalculating my water\u2019s salinity, I can\u2019t bring myself to pull out a measuring spoon for such a simple task. I blame my pride! I like to think my pinching precision is as good as Salt Bae\u2019s, but really it\u2019s hit or miss. That\u2019s why I now keep a jar of Jacobsen Salt Co.\u2019s Disco di Sale by my stove.\u201cYeah, that\u2019s a lot of salt, I know.\u201d\nThese salt disks each contain exactly 10 grams of compressed Italian fine sea salt and take the guesswork out of seasoning a pot of water. The first time I put them to use, I simply followed the directions on the jar and tossed three disks into four and a half quarts of boiling water, then dropped in a pound of spaghetti. The giant pot of water tasted less like the sea and more like the base of a well-seasoned broth. That night I ate the most flavorful red pesto pasta I\u2019d had in years. Apparently, my fear of oversalting my cooking water meant that I\u2019d been criminally undersalting it (something I didn\u2019t even realize until I used Disco di Sale).Photograph by Isa ZapataJacobsen Salt Co. Disco di Sale$12 at Jacobsen Salt Co.$15 at Williams SonomaThese quarter-size disks have since become my secret weapon for all things big-batch boiling. I use them to season everything from par-boiled potatoes for crispy hash browns to make-ahead blanched greens. When I\u2019m cooking in smaller batches for, say, quick lunchtime noodles for two, I opt for one disk. They\u2019re insanely easy to use and they make my food taste better, but mostly I like that they make me feel like a more confident cook, no measuring spoons required.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendShoppingCultureRecipes you want to make.
