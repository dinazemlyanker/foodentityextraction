Whenever I\u2019d go through the drive-thru with my dad and we\u2019d rattle off our usual order from the air-conditioned comfort of our Honda Odyssey (limeade for me, limeade and chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream in a cone for dad), he\u2019d tell me about how I needed to try shikanji, the salted limeade that he grew up drinking during scorching summers in India. He\u2019d point out how much better it was than any sort of warm-weather drink he\u2019d ever tried in the U.S. \u201cLike Indian Gatorade!\u201d he\u2019d always say. I\u2019d scoff, as I chewed on the tart, limeade-coated ice granules from my super-sized foam cup. Salt in limeade? Yeah, right.And then a few summers later, I tried it at my dad\u2019s cousin\u2019s place in Lucknow, a city in Uttar Pradesh. It was 100 degrees, and we had just arrived, completely dehydrated and drenched in sweat after an hours-long train ride with zero air conditioning. My cousin greeted us with a tray replete with glasses of shikanji. The drink was nothing more than loads of lime, ice, a touch of sugar, salt, and my dad\u2019s family\u2019s secret ingredient: a boatload of ground black pepper. At first sip, it was alarmingly savory\u2014not what you\u2019d expect from a summer cooler. But then I kept sipping, and couldn\u2019t stop. The salt and pepper played similar roles that they do in any dish, enhancing the existing flavors, without being overwhelming, and they had somehow super-charged the limeade. It felt more refreshing, more thirst-quenching, more interesting as a drink. I downed the glass and immediately asked for another. I remember very little about that cousin\u2019s house\u2014I think it was all white and smelled of aloo bhujia? \u2014but that shikanji was hard to forget.Since that trip to Lucknow, my dad has made shikanji on the regular back in Dallas, particularly during those dry, searing Texas summers. He squeezes the juice out of about 6 or 7 limes with a citrus press, and adds it to a blender along with double the water, ice cubes, around a \u00bc cup of sugar, and about a teaspoon each of salt and pepper. My dad always tosses in an extra spoonful pepper because the man goes through more of those large, plastic CostCo Kirkland Signature pepper grinders than any household ever should. We actually got into a big fight when we were shooting the photographs for my cookbook at our home in Dallas, because he thought I was perennially skimping on the pepper in the shikanji. But trust me: start conservatively, and you can always add more.He blitzes all those ingredients together until a foamy layer forms at the top of the blender, pours it over ice in heavy beer steins (my dad\u2019s preferred vessel for drinking just about anything), and garnishes the glasses with\u2014what else?\u2014even more ground pepper. When my brother-in-law, David, is in town, he will take the leftover shikanji and use it as a base for margaritas. I strongly recommend doing this.For me, shikanji symbolizes summer more than a drippy popsicle or an ice cream cone or a slice of sweet watermelon. I now completely understand what my dad meant when he called it \u201cIndian Gatorade.\u201d Shikanji sends this sodium-laden, electrolyte-like jolt throughout my entire body. It\u2019s the liquid version of standing directly in front of your blasting air conditioning unit during July in New York. And I would totally dump an entire water cooler of the stuff over my head after a football game.Priya Krishna\u2019s cookbook Indian-ish, documenting her journey of learning to make the distinct, hybridized cuisine of her chic, extremely skilled-in-the-kitchen mom, Ritu, will be out from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in April 2019.
