I\u2019m here at home with my partner. We\u2019re both working from home. We have more than enough food and a goodly stock of liquor. If you\u2019re able to take the time to read this, you are probably lucky, too. But, like all of us right now, it\u2019s difficult to get a handle on a sense of what day it is and how to make things feel normal. Some of my friends have posted their little schedules for their own days, or the ones they made for homeschooling their kids, some are wearing clothes they\u2019d normally wear to work, or doing certain things at the same time every day. Me? I\u2019m doing cocktail hour.This may shock you, but I typically don\u2019t drink cocktails every night. In recent days, that\u2019s changed. For me, making cocktails at home (which I encourage readers to do in each of my monthly articles) provides a similar comfort to cooking, but it feels different, more akin to doing a face mask. (Okay, I\u2019ve never done that, but I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s relaxing.) Cocktail hour isn\u2019t necessary, and it won\u2019t sustain you physically, but taking the time to prepare a drink for yourself that\u2019s completely unnecessary and enjoyable is emotionally nourishing.It\u2019s certainly helped in our household. Before I make my drink, I tidy up my desk and make sure all of my lunch and snack dishes are done. (So many dishes when you\u2019re eating three meals a day at home\u2026) Then I offer my partner a cocktail. Sometimes she wants one, sometimes not. When she does, she chooses one of her favorites: a Negroni or Boulevardier, Gimlet, Manhattan, anything with bourbon\u2026 It\u2019s nice to be able to do something for your favorite person, who is also stuck with you during this strange time.The Ferrari is equal parts Campari and Fernet-Branca.\nPhoto by Laura MurrayAs for me, I\u2019ve been saying yes to cocktails every night. (A serious note before we proceed: Please consider the state of your mental health before indulging in this particular ritual.) I\u2019ve been really into some simple, sturdy 50/50 amaro-based drinks lately, and they\u2019ve been fueling this evening cocktail ritual. My favorite is the Ferrari, an equal-parts drink (a shot, really) with murky origins in San Francisco, that\u2019s the best of two bitter worlds, 1 oz. Campari and 1 oz. Fernet-Branca. Since the former is an aperitivo and the latter is a digestivo, it works just as well before dinner as after. (Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve been working on an amaro story for you and you\u2019ll understand all of this better soon!) My pal Alex Delany is a big fan of mixing the artichoke-based amaro Cynar with Laird\u2019s applejack and I\u2019ve been drinking that some nights, too, with an ice cube and an orange twist.Extend the gift of a cocktail to those close to you. If you\u2019re quarantined with a partner or some roommates, offer them a drink! If you\u2019ve got kids in the household (or folks who don\u2019t drink!), make a mocktail with citrus, whatever syrup you have on hand (simple, grenadine, ginger, etc.), maybe some soda, and a fun garnish. If you can, make an extra cocktail in a small bottle or jar, leave it on your neighbor\u2019s doormat, call them to tell them it\u2019s there, and stand six feet away. If you\u2019re on your own at home, you might take some joy in the nascent-but-growing movement of virtual cocktail hours taking over during this time of social distancing. I\u2019m really looking forward to tonight\u2019s cocktail hour. I\u2019m thinking martinis.And here\u2019s an idea: If you\u2019re a person of means, consider reaching out to your favorite bar or bartender (maybe you follow them on Instagram?) and tipping them for the cocktail they would have made for you. The U.S. Bartenders Guild has a fund going now that a lot of people I know have applied, or will be applying to, in an attempt to meet their basic expenses. Please donate if you can. There are \u201cvirtual tip jars\u201d popping up on Venmo and other platforms for different parts of the industry, and for various companies and cities. Also, my friend MacKenzie Fegan just wrote this piece about how you can ensure your favorite bars, restaurants, and food-related businesses will be there when this is all over.So when you\u2019re at home, drinking your nice cocktail, chatting with your roommate (or your friend over Skype), raise a glass to (and Venmo) your local bartender and daydream about your first drink back at their bar.Al Culliton is a writer, bartender and consultant living in western Massachusetts.
