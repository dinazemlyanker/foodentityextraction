Soba. Rice. Spaghetti. Egg. Vermicelli. There\u2019s room in our hearts for all of the types of noodles in the world\u2014and fideos are no exception.Simply put, fideos means \u201cnoodles\u201d in Spanish. But the word actually refers to a particular kind of noodle\u2014short and golden, with vermicelli-like thinness\u2014as well as to specific dishes. In parts of Mexico and the U.S., fideos are typically prepared in sopa de fideo, a brothy noodle soup, whereas in Spain\u2014and Catalonia, in particular\u2014fideos are featured in a drier, jammier dish called fideu\u00e0. In this application, fideos are not boiled at all, but rather simmered in a rich, flavorful broth for a finished product that\u2019s similar to paella in that it\u2019s smoky, tomato-y, and umami-packed, with various protein and vegetable add-ins. .When assistant food editor Sohla El-Waylly set out to develop a recipe that would capture off-the-charts flavors and textures of Catalonian fideos in a weeknight-friendly package, she first tackled the noodles: Because not all grocery stores sell designated fideos, Sohla calls for  scrunching thin spaghetti into \u00bd-inch to 1-inch pieces, which makes for a pretty good approximation. (Regular spaghetti will also work in her recipe, but stay away from angel hair\u2014it\u2019s so thin that it will cook too quickly.)Then, Sohla thought about how she was going to get big flavor while bypassing the typical saffron, squid ink, or seafood. The answer? Building in stages. She first renders the fat from chicken thighs, then uses what\u2019s left in the pan to toast the makeshift fideos. Not only does this impart a nutty flavor to the noodles, but it also ensures that they\u2019ll withstand the relatively long cook time.Once the noodles are a deep golden-brown, Sohla makes a soffritto\u2014a slow-cooked mixture of onion, garlic, and tomato paste\u2014and bolsters it with anchovies and lemon juice. The anchovies provide the umami jolt and the lemon brings brightness. All together, this flavor-packed base forms the foundation of the fideos, replacing seafood, chicken, or vegetable stock.After the chicken thighs and noodles go back in the pan, Sohla sends the skillet into the oven, for a gentle, even cook and a crunchy, spiky top. When you serve the fideos, don\u2019t be surprised if your guests (slash roommates) fight over those crispy, browned noodles. But sit back and let them have at it: You\u2019ll know that underneath lies the jammy, tomato-y, super savory, tender noodles that just might be the best part.Get the recipe:Fideos With Chicken Thighs and KaleWith a crispy, toasted top hiding saucy, tomato-y noodles, this one-skillet broken spaghetti dish is anything but one-note.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titNoodleSpanishRecipes you want to make.
