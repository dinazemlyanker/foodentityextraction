We spoke for nearly two hours, and her energy and enthusiasm for really old wheats rubbed off on me like rice flour on a black apron. \u201cTell me more about barley!!!\u201d \u201cHow exactly does buckwheat taste like RAIN?\u201d \u201cOoh, purple cornmeal!\u201d It went like that.The next thing I knew, I was flying through the aisles of my local bulk foods store, scooping up spelt flour, scouring the shelves for sorghum flour, and deliberating between regular and dark rye flour (go with both, figure it out later). I purchased multiple cornmeals.Ricotta Cornmeal Pound Cake\u2014curd and cream optional.\nPhotographs by Jenny Huang, food styling by Sue Li, prop styling by Sophie StrangioSoon, I was cooking my way through her fantastic upcoming cookbook, Mother Grains: Recipes for the Grain Revolution, and preaching to anyone who would listen about the wonders of sorghum flour, or as Jullapat calls the thousand-year-old crop, \u201cthe grain of the future.\u201dAnd that\u2019s the funny thing about ancient grains, defined by their lack of genetic modification through the centuries: They\u2019re old as sin, yet Jullapat\u2019s book makes them feel modern and exciting.Mother Grains focuses on eight whole grains that are grown and sold across the U.S.: barley, buckwheat, corn, oat, rice, rye, sorghum, and wheat. Her recipes cover the grains in all forms: from sorghum syrup to toasted barley tea to a chewy kamut salad. I went straight to baked goods\u2014what we featured in our February issue\u2014familiar favorites given new life with speckled, yes nutty, whole grain flours. That was blueberry muffins then; this is blueberry muffins now: enhanced with nutritious, low-gluten spelt flour, both in the batter and in the crispy streusel topping. \u201cThe spelt brings a little bit more texture, but also a little bit more depth, more oomph, more dimension to your baking,\u201d Jullapat says. I made them twice.Barley flour is the secret to these Macadamia and Brown Butter Blondies.\nIn the recipes we\u2019re sharing from the book (see them all below), you can try blondies with malty, cereal-milk-like barley flour. Make the easiest shortbread ever with wheaty, historic einkorn. Granola scones: self-explanatory. Ricotta-cornmeal pound cake, heavenly. I baked the appropriately named Trouble Cookies with sweet sorghum flour, Heath bits, coconut, and cashews and took them camping, for sustenance. (Make sure to store all of your newly purchased whole grain flours in the fridge or freezer, though, as they tend to go rancid when not used frequently. Jullapat stores hers in zip-lock bags. I dig a stackable Cambro.)But say you\u2019re not me, and you find my insistence on spelt flour to be a little annoying, or asking a bit much. I\u2019ll let Roxana reply: \u201cYou have all these spices. You have two, three options of breakfast cereals. Yogurts, you might have two or three flavors. It\u2019s the same with grains. And with more raw material, there\u2019s more potential.\u201d These grains are also more healthful than industrialized-up-the-wazoo all-purpose flour. They\u2019re packed with vitamins and minerals and everyone\u2019s favorite\u2014fiber.These Blueberry Spelt Muffins are on repeat.\u00a0\nPhotographs by Jenny Huang, food styling by Sue Li, prop styling by Sophie StrangioAs fun as Mother Grains is to bake through, it\u2019s also educational and empowering. \u201cI was struck by the fact that our conventional, global flour supply reflects only a handful of wheat varieties,\u201d Jullapat writes in the opening pages. In each chapter, before she dives into the recipes, she tells the history of the grain and explains its nutritional and environmental benefits.When you buy heritage grains, especially from small producers, you\u2019re not only supporting the local economy, but you\u2019re also advocating for agricultural biodiversity and more sustainable farming methods. Like Maine Grains in Skowhegan, Maine, which mills certified organic and heritage grains \u201cthat are grown in rotation with crops that balance nutrients in the soil,\u201d founder Amber Lambke says. Buckwheat is one of those bumper crops, feeding the soil after other crops have depleted it (use that as an excuse to make the buckwheat chocolate cake below). Sorghum can grow in hot, dry conditions requiring a lot less water and land space than other grains. \u201cThe restoration of grain growing in the northeast serves bakers, brewers, and chefs,\u201d Lambke notes, \u201cand is a step toward restoring balanced agricultural practices that leave the earth better than we found it.\u201dBut maybe the most convincing argument for baking with these whole grain flours is that they\u2019re delicious. \u201cThe initial steps are very noncommittal: Just buy a bag of flour,\u201d Jullapat says. We\u2019ll help you figure out what to do with it.Mother Grains$40 at Amazon$37 at Bookshop1 / 7ChevronChevronRicotta Cornmeal Pound CakeView RecipeReady to buy some heritage grains?
