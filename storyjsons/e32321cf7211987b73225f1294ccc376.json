If the cooked tofu isn\u2019t as hot as you\u2019d hoped, amp it up by tucking a slice or two of Fresno chile into your wrap.Ingredients4 servings 5scallions4garlic cloves, finely grated12\" piece ginger, peeled, finely grated1Tbsp. virgin coconut oil or vegetable oil2Tbsp. Thai red curry paste114-oz. package firm tofu, drained, broken into 1\" pieces1cup unsweetened coconut milkKosher salt1Tbsp. fresh lime juice1Fresno chile, thinly sliced (optional)1bunch collard greens, leaves halved lengthwise, ribs and stems removed, covered, chilled\u00bdcup cilantro leaves with tender stems\u00bdcup Dang Original coconut chips or toasted unsweetened coconut flakesLime wedges (for serving)PreparationStep 1Remove dark green tops from scallions and thinly slice on a diagonal. Place in a small bowl, cover with a damp paper towel, and chill until ready to serve. Thinly slice remaining white and pale green parts crosswise and place in another small bowl; add garlic and ginger. (Have scallion mixture, curry paste, tofu, and coconut milk near the stove and at the ready so you can work quickly.)Step 2Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Cook scallion mixture, stirring, until just beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Add curry paste and cook, stirring, until it begins to stick to pan, about 1 minute. Add tofu and coconut milk, season with salt, and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently until sauce is almost completely evaporated and you can see the bottom of skillet, 5\u20137 minutes. Stir in lime juice.Step 3Transfer tofu mixture to a platter and top with chile, if using. Arrange collard greens, cilantro, and reserved scallion tops on platter so that each component is visible and easily accessible. Place coconut chips in a small bowl and arrange lime wedges on a small plate.How would you rate Curried Tofu Wraps?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleI really liked this.  I browned the tofu in the pan before making the sauce for a little more texture then incorporated it back in to soak up the flavors.  Seems like it'd be a little soggy without doing that. I also used lettuce instead of collards. The tofu would be good in noodle bowls, salads, and more if you didn't feel like wraps.cassidy.haightRichmond, VA7/12/2019These were great! Perfect for a light (but filling) summer meal. I got spicy curry paste and loved it.AnonymousLos Angeles4/3/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titWrapTofuOther IngredientsCollard GreensLeafy GreensVegetableCoconutFruitQuickEasyWeeknight MealsMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeVeganVegetarianHealthyishSimmerLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
