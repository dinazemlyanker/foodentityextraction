I\u2019ve never had a tiny body, and I grew up really tomboyish with short curly hair amid a sea of Southern California straight-haired blondes. I had no desire to wear makeup, and it always felt weird when my mom made me put on dresses; it just wasn\u2019t my personality at all.A lot of my anxiety about not being \u201cfeminine\u201d enough comes from my own family and culture. Iranians have a very specific, exaggerated version of femininity: making sure your eyebrows are really well-kept; that you\u2019ve removed all other facial and body hair; that you wear clothes that are feminine enough, like dresses and skirts and certain kinds of shoes; and that you don\u2019t chew gum in front of men. There\u2019s a lot of, \u201cThis is what a woman does, and this is what a woman does not do.\u201d I couldn\u2019t bring myself to care about it\u2014I just wanted to be climbing trees and riding bikes. But I still felt like a failure for feeling that way.The times when I feel the most attractive and like me have so little to do with what I\u2019m wearing or whether I have the right makeup on.The first time I saw a cut from my Netflix show [Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat], I remember opening my computer screen, seeing myself, and closing the screen. I panicked and thought, I can\u2019t do this. But I had to participate in the production, which meant I could either spend every day of the editing process going down some emotional sinkhole about myself and the way I looked, or I could do my job, which was to critically watch this show and try to make it better. It was almost as if I had to decide to not see myself\u2014like when you\u2019re brushing your teeth in the morning and you know you\u2019re in the mirror, but you\u2019re not ready to look yet.When we were filming in Italy, I knew I wanted to do a montage in which I eat like 50 different scoops of gelato. I knew that was possibly an invitation for someone to comment on my weight, but I just had to put it out of my mind because if I sat around being worried about what somebody might say about the way I look, then I wouldn\u2019t be able to be myself. And the times when I feel the most attractive and like me have so little to do with what I\u2019m wearing or whether I have the right makeup on. It has so much more to do with the environment I\u2019m in and who I\u2019m around and how they\u2019re able to let me feel funny, or witty, or silly, or generous, or smart.There\u2019s still plenty for me to be insecure about as a woman of color living in a world designed to make us loathe ourselves. I have a knee injury that makes exercise really complicated, and I\u2019ve gained a lot of weight in the past few years, so it\u2019s harder to find dresses that fit. I\u2019ve also had a couple of surgeries recently. The older I get, anytime something isn\u2019t working right, I\u2019m much more aware of how important it is to take care of my body because it\u2019s a physical thing that is deteriorating. But I also now understand that I can\u2019t let shame control me. If I did, it would be the only thing I would have the time or energy for. I\u2019m trying to grow my way out of that.As told to Christina Chaey, associate editorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishFeel Better in 2020essayRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
