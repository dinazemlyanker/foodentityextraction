See our past recommendations here!I tried it all. I stored my phone away from my loft bed, forcing me down some very steep, not-up-to-code stairs. I routinely read and re-read all the late fees I\u2019d incurred for sleeping through morning circuit training classes. Nothing\u2014not even shame and losing money, my two greatest weaknesses!\u2014got me to actually roll out of bed when my alarm went off. That is, until my very patient husband bought me the LBell Wake-Up Light and Alarm Clock.The stylish, opaque globe is like the Swiss Army knife of sleep: It\u2019s a clock and wake-up light (and also a sleep aid and radio). Every morning, the clock slowly emits light, starting with a deep red and ending with a bright, white light, to mimic the sunrise and quietly wake me up in the 20 minutes before my alarm sounds. At the end of that cycle, a soundtrack of gently flowing water fills my tiny loft, telling me that it\u2019s time to get up. And I actually do.Now I\u2019m up early\u2014sometimes even before the peaceful trickle of water begins\u2014to stretch before class or make some coffee. That\u2019s because I feel rested, not jerked awake by my usual phone alarm and craving just ten more minutes of sleep. Somehow, I\u2019m still a bit late to the office...but I\u2019ll just have to blame my post-workout hair straightening routine for that. \u2014Elyse Inamine, digital restaurant editorBuy It: L Bell Wakeup Light, $46All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
