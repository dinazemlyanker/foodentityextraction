It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Who is your favorite childYou know you have one. We\u2019re updating this list of our reader\u2019 keepers, as in, the Bon App\u00e9tit recipes you make over and over again. I want to know yours!! This year, mine was Chris Morocco\u2019s \u201csambalognese\u201d (pictured above). The spicy sauce made all other red sauces pointless to me. I need the HEAT. Heat that\u2019s perfectly balanced by a little sugar, a lotta garlic, plus ginger, soy sauce, and rice vinegar.So please, tell me your \u201ckeeper\u201d\u2014new recipe or old!\u2014by emailing staff.bonappetit@gmail.com. Oh! I\u2019m also looking for etiquette questions about hosting dinner parties; send \u2018em if you got \u2018em.Get the recipe: Spicy-Sweet Sambal Pork NoodlesWant this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Marcus NilssonThe end is nearOf the year, sheesh! Don\u2019t be so morbid. And as we close out 2019, Google sent out a round-up of the year\u2019s top trending searches, a sweet little reminder that you\u2019re always being watched. Google\u2019s a lot like Santa in that way. They see you when you\u2019re searching, they know when you\u2019re awake, they know if you\u2019ve been incognito so be incognito for goodness\u2019 sake! Ohhhh the top trending recipe search was \u201cshepherd\u2019s pie\u201d??? Why??? But more intriguing was the top cocktail search: \u201cpornstar martini.\u201dWhat. the. Heck. Is. That.Actually, it sounds amazing. It\u2019s a frothy orange drink that\u2019s super popular in the U.K. (and was invented there, according to stevethebartender.com.au, in 2002). Delish has a simplified recipe: 4 oz. vanilla vodka, \u00bd cup passionfruit juice, and prosecco. But wait, the prosecco is served in a shot glass like a sidecar. This is confusing!!! Why not make it a spritz? That would be so good! I guess the prosecco shot is hyperbolic on purpose, it\u2019s over-the-top, like [unprintable thoughts].Get a great shepherd\u2019s pie recipe here.Photo by Ted + Chelsea CavanaughCookie weekIt was Rick Martinez COOKIE WEEK at BA this week and while the fashionable tie-dye cookies and minty black-and-whites got a lot of aesthetic attention, my favorite is the butter pecan skillet cookie. It\u2019s a giant, nutty, buttery cookie with a simple vanilla glaze and maple syrup-roasted pecans on top. I die. Rick, who developed these recipes in the middle of his summer vacation, told me they were inspired by \u201cFire Island queens\u2014all they wanted to eat was Butter Pecan Talenti gelato.\u201d Yesssss.They were the shining maple star of Emma Wartzman\u2019s Thanksgiving and were \u201ca real accomplishment in texture,\u201d she said. Kate Fenoglio reports that they got even better a few days after baking\u2014and are exceptional with coffee for breakfast. \u201cMy aunt-in-law made them and they were a huge hit,\u201d said cookie editor Hilary Cadigan. Priya Krishna tried nearly an entire skillet-full during tastings: \u201cTruly they are one of the best cookies I have had in a long long time,\u201d she said, \u201cand I eat a lot of cookies.\u201dGet the recipe: Butter Pecan Skillet CookiesRead: A nice story about Rick \u201cSugar Man\u201d Martinez at SlatePhoto by @constellationinspirationSpeaking of cookiesAmy H. made ALL of the cookies from our December issue\u2014cool!!!Speaking of Rick and cookiesRick got a COOKIE MANICURE by the mega-talented @jmoneynails!!!!Listen upThey roped me into recording a mini-segment on the Bon App\u00e9tit Foodcast called \u201cCook/Marry/Kill\u201d where I pick a recipe to make, a food story I love, and a food thing I want to gently murder every week. It\u2019s fun, I swear. Listen here if you want some musings on the $120,000 banana and KFC\u2019s fried chicken-scented firelog. Or not! Carry on with your day. I\u2019ll never know.Unnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekJarren Vink\u201cDo you make or buy pigs in a blanket?\u201d was a question Christina Chaey posed to our Slack group. The replies BLEW UP. \u201cIf by \u2018make,\u2019 you mean buy the Pillsbury crescents and wrap them around cuts of sausage/hot dogs/kielbasa, then yes,\u201d said Jesse Sparks. \u201cBut that\u2019s as far as I\u2019m going for Notorious P.I.B.\u2019s.\u201d Incredible abbreviating. \u201cHebrew national baby!\u201d cheered on Molly Baz. Aliza Abarbanel roots to Trader Joe\u2019s P.I.B.s. And you know it\u2019s an important discussion when Adam Rapoport chimes in: \u201cBuy. But\u2014and this is a real [redacted] thing to say, says the guy in a turtleneck and a blazer, looking like Tom from Succession\u2014but the ones at Polo Bar are REALLY good.\u201d To which Chaey replied: \u201cDo they have a freezer section or\u2026\u201dPretzel blankets anyone?Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecultureShrimp Scampi Pasta for the Hesitant Home CookBy Alex BeggscultureWhat to Cook When It\u2019s Dark at 4 p.m.By Alex BeggscultureMore Prunes!
