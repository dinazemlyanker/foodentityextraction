Our first episode features editor in chief Dawn Davis and author Bryan Washington talking about his new novel, Memorial, and its unexpected main character: food. Below are some highlights from the conversation; check out our Instagram for the full interview.Dawn Davis: My real and first love is books, and I just became editor in chief of Bon App\u00e9tit. So your novel was a way for me to blend my two loves: food and writing. There are so many rich food descriptions. People express affection through cooking.Bryan Washington: Yeah, for me a lot of it was trying to write a story about warmth. And to write a story about comfort, where the characters were approaching one another from a place of affection and love. That was largely the sort of story that I wanted to read, so it ultimately ended up becoming the sort of thing I wanted to write, the kind of thing that would ultimately hold my attention.DD: Talk to me about your relationship with food.BW: A lot of it stemmed from just being a latchkey kid, like in junior high, just growing up. And both my parents worked, so if you wanted to eat, then you kind of had to learn how to cook because you\u2019re the only one who\u2019s there after school.But there are so many great food writers without whom I wouldn\u2019t even be thinking of food in a literary sense, whether it\u2019s folks like Tejal Rao, Samin Nosrat, John Birdsall, Eric Kim, or Elazar Sontag, these folks are really thinking about the different ways that food works, and not only how food works but also how food allows folks to come together or not. It\u2019s just a really heartening thing to get to have work that\u2019s in conversation with folks like that.DD: In many ways this is a novel that turns stereotypes on its heads. Benson is Black and his father, though flawed, is there and wants to be involved in his life. And Mike is Japanese and his father kind of abandons the family and goes back to Japan. Did you set out to disrupt stereotypes or did these characters evolve into that space?BW: I didn\u2019t really set out to turn stereotypes on their head because I feel like if you\u2019re writing life as it\u2019s actually lived, it\u2019s not one in which you\u2019re working stereotypes and archetypes. Houston is a really deeply diverse city. So it is not shocking or strange to have a narrative where you have Black folks, and you have Asian American folks, Latinx folks, and everyone is in congress in the same narrative. There\u2019s a way in which publishing in this country can silo the diverse books and the anti-racist books into being the only ones with characters from marginalized communities. But that\u2019s just not true to life at all. So it was just about trying to write a story I\u2019d want to read, featuring the kinds of stories I\u2019ve been privy to and my friends have been privy to. And those are the kinds of stories, featuring many different kinds of people from many different places, I\u2019m most interested in.DD: So you wrote Lot, a collection of short stories, before Memorial, and you got a lot of acclaim and attention for that. President Obama even named it as one of his favorite books of 2019. So what does that do to a writer\u2019s ego? And how do you, you know, stay focused on writing and going on to the next book without getting overwhelmed by the success?BW: Yeah, I mean, I don\u2019t know that I think of it in terms of ego because I\u2019m surprised any time someone reads whatever the f*#% I\u2019m trying to do, like, that\u2019s always really shocking to me. It was certainly really lovely to hear that he read it, and to see it on that scale, but it\u2019s just as lovely when my friends say that they\u2019ve taken time with the book, or when my students say it, or when my neighbors or folks out in the world say that they\u2019ve taken time with it.DD: Given the pandemic and lockdown I think we\u2019re all hoping that, you know, restaurants will be able to survive despite the possible next wave of infections. What\u2019s your feeling about the restaurants in Houston?BW: It\u2019s hard to say a general feeling. But it\u2019s been really heartening to see the ways the community has come together to support those restaurants, whether it\u2019s through attending pop-ups or fundraisers or buying ready-to-eat packaged meals.DD: Do you have a favorite restaurant there?BW: I don\u2019t know if I have a favorite. But I have a few I\u2019ve been to fairly recently. I guess I\u2019ll say Korean Noodle House, La Guadalupana, and My Baguettes are the places I\u2019ve been going to quite often.DD: What kind of tools would we see in your kitchen? My must-haves include a zester. I take a zester with me if I go to someone\u2019s apartment; I sneak a zester in my pocket.BW: I mean, I feel like a zester is something that is now going to be essential. For me a mandoline is really essential because my knife skills are getting better, but they\u2019re not quite there and a mandoline just makes life so much easier. And also a donabe. If you\u2019re making shabu-shabu or hot pot, if you\u2019re making a really lovely bowl of rice, it\u2019s just super useful.DD: Did you formally study Japanese food? Did you read cookbooks? Or is it just something that came from one thing leading to another? What would you say is your favorite dish from Osaka?BW: I grew up next to a Japanese American restaurant, and I found myself there after school, just hanging out, quite often. So that was probably my first introduction. And I started going to Osaka about five years ago; now, once or twice a year. It was mostly just to visit friends, but being privy to their kindness and the attentiveness that they\u2019d show in their respective kitchens and getting to eat around the city was something I just felt really grateful to get to do. And certainly there are any number of cookbooks, whether it\u2019s Japanese Soul Cooking by Tadashi Ono, which he cowrote with Harris Salat, or Japanese Home Cooking by Sonoko Sakai. There are loads and loads of texts that we\u2019re just really lucky to have in translation.For the latter half of that question, I\u2019d probably say okonomiyaki. The loose English translation is \u201cgrilled as you like\u201d because you can fit so many of the things you enjoy into that particular dish. But I also really like tamagoyaki. And y\u2019all actually just had a piece, I think, earlier this month about that dish, which was really lovely.DD: What\u2019s your writing day like and how does food interact with that?BW: Oh, it\u2019s pretty different now, being in the midst of the pandemic. Usually, I\u2019m someone who writes in a bunch of different coffee shops. And where I live in Houston, you have hella boba shops all over the place. So that\u2019s usually my jam. But as of late it\u2019s just been making quick sandwiches like quick snacky foods that you're able to pick up and then have, like, in the midst of doing whatever you\u2019re doing that are not like a lot of work to put together but that have a high payoff. So it\u2019s trying to find little things that are quick but also deeply comforting and satisfying.I\u2019m finding that I have to be kinder to myself, right? Like, not being as productive as I would have been like eight months ago, nine months ago, or even a year and a half ago. So yeah, I think that there\u2019s a certain amount of grace that we should all be extending to ourselves right now.Memorial$19 at Amazon$25 at BookshopExplore Bon App\u00e9titBooksRecipes you want to make.
