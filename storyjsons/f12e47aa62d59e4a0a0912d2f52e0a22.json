Complex but refreshing; I was in a hurry so I used simple syrup from a bottle and made the tea with a hibiscus tea bag and a bay leaf steeped in the fridge for 45 minutes or so and it tasted great! Also works well with olive juice.Cristine QDallas, TX6/1/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titCocktailDrinks AllSoul FoodAmericanHibiscusHerbs & SpicesVermouthAlcohol & Other DrinksLimeCitrusFruitDrinksKwanzaaJuneteenthRecipes you want to make.
