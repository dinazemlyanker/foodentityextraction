Risi e Bisi. Risi e Bisi. Isn\u2019t that more fun to say than \u201crisotto\u201d? Say it three more times to make sure and then wipe the spittle from the screen. We were craving a risi e bisi recipe\u2014at this point you\u2019re just hissing\u2014this spring. Something lighter than risotto; a vehicle for green spring peas, pancetta, and as much parm as you can handle.Other things to know about risi e bisi (\u201crice with peas\u201d). Like risotto, there will be stirring. Lots of stirring. It\u2019s meditative! And ultimately not that much brute strength. You can do this.Andy Baraghani, who developed the recipe, couldn\u2019t resist doctoring it up, so our recipe is topped with something extra: sizzled fried scallions. You can skip this, but the added crispy crunch is exactly what it sounds like, and the scallion oil you create when frying them can be used to drizzle over the bowl when serving. Andy is the definition of extra. But damn, is it good.Otherwise, you begin with pancetta, then add in aromatics (onion, garlic), then arborio rice, then white wine, and finally chicken stock, a ladleful at a time. Each of those commas is you stirring. This isn\u2019t the case where you dump everything in at once and wait; the texture hinges on the slow roll, the nonstop stirring action.The peas come in last, with mint, butter, a ton of parm, and lemon zest to keep things from getting too one-note (the note is: butter). Thanks to the starch in the rice, everything emulsifies and gets wonderfully creamy. You\u2019re finished when the risi e bisi has a barely soupy consistency, not as set as risotto but not watery.I was wrong. That\u2019s not when you\u2019re finished. You\u2019re really finished when you add the sizzled fried scallions on top with a swirl of scallion oil, and even more parm, because going the extra distance is worth it. Just ask Andy.Get the recipe:Risi e BisiLike risotto, but a bit lighter and brighter. Oh, and there\u2019s pancetta.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titItalianSpring PeaRiceRecipes you want to make.
