After walking past rows of slot machines and through heavy wooden doors of the Park MGM, you\u2019ll suddenly find yourself out of space and time and in the possession of a soothing, icy gin martini.ORDER THE: unfussy, old-school chophouse staples executed with new-school aplomb. Perfectly poached shrimp reclining on a divan of crushed ice with spicy dijonnaise. Dressed lump crab meat piled high atop of a buttery avocado half, flanked by crisp leaves of butter lettuce. And while the steaks\u2014dry aged and impeccably crusty, with an ample bearnaise sidecar\u2014more than hold their own in this beef-obsessed city, the rest of the entrees are every bit as formidable: craggy-edged spiced fried chicken thighs, rosemary-scented lamb chops, and the restaurant group\u2019s infamous, expertly-griddled cheeseburger.THE VIBE IS: seductively dim\u2014all Tiffany lamps and burgundy velvet\u2014and the volume is almost conspiratorially-low in merciful contrast to the fluorescent sting and bell-and-whistle chaos of the casino floor.PRO TIP: A side order of broccoli, lightly charred and dressed simply with butter and plenty of lemon, is a welcome spot of brightness on a menu that otherwise skews rich-on-rich\u2014non-optional.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open everyday for dinner: Sunday to Thursday, from 5 to 10 p.m., and Friday and Saturday, from 5 to 11 p.m.Explore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
