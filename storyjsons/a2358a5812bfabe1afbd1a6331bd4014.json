Spending so much more time at home cooking and cleaning, I\u2019ve been surprised at what I\u2019m reaching for to make my job easier and even\u2015dare I say\u2015more pleasurable during these \u201cquarantimes.\u201d\u00a0Of course, there are my stalwart kitchen helpers (seamless silicone spatula, I\u2019m looking at you), including some divisive players I\u2019ll never relinquish (ahem, garlic press). And then there are some sleeper hits whose value only seems to grow with time and use. Enter the skimmer\u2015specifically, the fine-mesh skimmer.\u00a0Now, many of us know the benefits of a great spider, whose long handle and generous slotted scoop give you the ability to safely retrieve everything from chicken wings to boiled eggs with aplomb. But what about when you\u2019re tackling a more detail-oriented task? That\u2019s where the fine-mesh skimmer excels.\u00a0Its uses are plentiful: removing the foamy scum that surfaces on a long-simmering braise or soup (think beans and bone broth); lifting that layer of cooled and hardened fat off of said bone broth; cleaning up all the residual bits in the oil after a fry-up session; and even fetching peas out of boiling water for blanching. While I\u2019m skimming away, I keep the mesh area clean by simply flicking it into a nearby bowl filled halfway with water. After I\u2019m done, I hand-wash the skimmer so I don\u2019t miss any stubborn greasy areas (though this particular model does claim to be dishwasher-safe).\u00a0This $6 stainless-steel model is the one I currently have. It\u2019s billed as a hot pot skimmer, which makes total sense, as it can find errant fish balls as easily as it can keep the communal soup clear of scum. Its 4-inch diameter makes it wide enough to capture most debris, and the 9-inch-long handle (including a tiny loop for hanging) provides a safe distance from sputtering oil and hot liquids.\u00a0You might be wondering what a skimmer can do that a regular old spoon cannot. Sure, a spoon will work, but its deeper bowl will also take with it perfectly fine, clean soup. Meanwhile, the fine mesh of the skimmer is a slight and shallow concave net, poised to lightly and quickly glide across a liquid, lifting off the impurities and not much more. Because the screen of the mesh is ultrafine (unlike a spider\u2019s spaced-out basket), no particles can escape.\u00a0Don\u2019t get me wrong: I\u2019m not advocating that everything be consomm\u00e9-level clear. But never underestimate the power of a just-skimmed stock or sauce\u2015you can taste the care that goes into one. If you\u2019re looking for a more elegant tool to help out where the spider falls short, this affordable fine-mesh skimmer might just be the ticket.\u00a0\u00a0Photo by Emma Fishman\u00a0Fine-Mesh Skimmer$6 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingSoupStockBrothRecipes you want to make.
