(Catch us on the beach instead.) We just believe that, if you use peak-season produce, you don't have to do much actual cooking at all. With a little creativity, even the simplest recipes can feel totally fresh.Natural foods chef Jodi Moreno gets us. Her new cookbook More With Less: Whole Food Cooking Made  Irresistibly Simple is full of pared-down recipes that are ultra-seasonal and look gorgeous too\u2014so, naturally, we had to know her summer game plan. \u201cOnce you get cooking this way, you realize that making things simple and delicious is not that intimidating,\" Moreno says. These are her best tips for simplifying dinner without sacrificing creativity or flavor.Moreno in her kitchen\nPhoto courtesy of Jodi Moreno1. Let your blender work for youIs there anything more low maintenance than just throwing a bunch of vegetables in a blender? In the heat of summer, Moreno loves to make frosty green gazpacho, packed with cucumbers, avocado, and plenty of herbs. To keep her green gazpacho from veering into green juice territory, she adds plenty of savory aromatics like garlic and shallots. \u201cI like to put toasted almonds on top for a contrast of texture, and also I like to add a cooked element,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes you think of it more like a soup.\u201d2. Lighten up your grilling with citrusOranges may be a classic winter fruit, but Moreno likes to use a hit of orange juice to add zing to dressings and marinades. \"Orange juice doesn't get used as often in cooking, but it rounds things out and tastes very balanced and bright,\" she says. \"I love how unexpected it is.\" Try mixing orange juice with chiles to make a fiery mojo sauce that can be spooned over grilled fish, chicken, and vegetables.3. Big batch toppings make the differenceEspecially in high summer, when turning on your oven is a chore, a heavy dusting of dukkah can turn simple raw vegetables like tomato and corn into a nuanced, flavorful salad. \u201cWhen it's really hot, I\u2019ll keep things really simple but then throw a homemade (or storebought) condiment on top,\u201d Moreno says. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of gomasio because I feel like it adds a little pop of texture and briny saltiness.\" She also relies on agrodolce, gremolata, and quick-pickled vegetables to bring meals together. These hearty toppings are easy to make in big batches and often don't require an oven\u2014a blessing in the middle of August.4. Miso and stone fruit are the ultimate summer dessert shortcut\u201cWe do a lot of dinner parties and I never think about dessert\u2014I just dump fruit into a pan and make a crumble or crisp,\u201d says Moreno. To amp up a crumble\u2019s rich, buttery flavors without adding dairy, she likes to add \u00bc cup sweet white miso to her topping mix. The result? Light but rich-tasting desserts that feel fresh, not overly buttery. \u201cFor something even easier, I roast halved fruit with a sprinkle of sugar and serve it alongside ice cream for a sweet afternoon snack,\u201d Moreno says. Trust us: nobody\u2019s ever complained about cold ice cream and hot caramelized stone fruit.5. Don\u2019t be afraid to use your oven every once in a whileRoasted vegetables are a staple of winter cooking, but there\u2019s a compelling argument for using this cooking technique year round\u2014especially in the beginning of summer when the weather is milder. \u201cI know people are afraid of turning on their oven in the summer, but I\u2019m a big fan of big tray of roasted summer veggies and mixing those with raw vegetables, lettuce, or even a grain like quinoa,\u201d says Moreno. \u201cYou have a beautiful, delicious filling meal, and it\u2019s pretty low maintenance, too.\u201d There's no need to turn your oven on for everything, but mixing fresh produce with some roasted (or grilled!) vegetables creates a nice contrast.Buy More With Less: Whole Food Cooking Made  Irresistibly Simple, $25Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSimpleWeeknightSummerRead Morecooking82 Healthy Summer Recipes to Make Over and Over AgainGallery82 SlidesBy The Healthyish TeamRecipes you want to make.
