You can keep the fruit chunky, chop it the consistency of a pico de gallo, or blend it into a smooth sauce\u2014the choice is yours. If you can\u2019t find culantro (also known as chadon beni), you can use cilantro in a pinch, though the flavor will be much less intense.

Chow is mainly eaten as a snack and basically any fruit can be made into a chow. Very rushed and not well researched article. Only chutney is served alongside those dishes mentioned which is a grated chow. Please do better. \nSigned a Trinbagonian  A TrinbagonianTrinidad and Tobago 1/9/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladTrinidadianCaribbeanPineappleFruitMangoStone FruitEasyQuickSideVegetarianVeganRawDairy-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreeJuneteenthKwanzaaDinnerRecipes you want to make.
