You\u2019ve hyped yourself up: You\u2019re wearing your good sweatpants, the ones with the good elastic. You\u2019ve got Lizzo bumping in your ears, reminding you that can do anything. You didn\u2019t even have to take a DNA test to know that you are 100 percent that cook.* (*You know the lyric.)You head to the grocery store, saunter over to the noodle aisle, and then you realize you\u2019re not exactly sure where to start. Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ve got you.First, know the basics. What are soba noodles? Soba is a Japanese noodle made from buckwheat flour and water, and sometimes a bit of whole-wheat flour to keep the noodles from deteriorating. Making soba by hand is an intensely complicated process that artisans spend years studying. But while the absolute best soba is made in small batches and sold fresh, soba for your weeknight life is readily available at the grocery store.Then, know what to look for. Generally speaking, buckwheat flour should always be one of the first ingredients on the label, and the list should be relatively short. You\u2019re looking for a high ratio of buckwheat flour to whole-wheat flour: Ideally, the noodles will contain around 70\u201380 percent buckwheat (this is the nihachi-style). Anything containing a higher percentage of buckwheat is prone to falling apart during the cooking process. But too little buckwheat means your noodles will be prone to gumminess and bloating (and they won\u2019t be as nutty-tasting).This ratio of buckwheat to whole-wheat flour can vary widely depending on the brand and variety. But a good rule of thumb is that the larger the percentage of buckwheat in the soba, the darker gray-brown the color will be.Soba noodles play nicely with creamy sauces and crispy leaves.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Michelle GattonWhile our Test Kitchen editors aren\u2019t particularly picky when buying dried soba, we tend to reach for Hakubaku Organic Soba for a consistent, reliable option without extra stabilizers.Now, cook it carefully. Cook small batches of noodles in lightly salted boiling water right before you\u2019re ready to eat. Soba thrives with space, so make sure to leave ample room for the cooking noodles to swirl around the pot freely so that they don\u2019t tangle into a sticky mess.The thinner the soba, the faster it will cook. Most soba cooks between 3\u20135 minutes, never longer, but always follow the cooking instructions on the package of your soba. The best way to prevent things from glomming up is to be hyper-vigilant while cooking. Once you\u2019ve thrown your noodles into the pot of boiling water, stay stove-side. This isn\u2019t the time to go grab your phone from another room or daydream about how great you and Jharrel Jerome would look together\u2014even if it is objectively true and the two of you would spend wonderful Saturday afternoons in sweats. Once a few minutes have passed, pull them out and immediately serve your noodles.If things do get gummy, drain the noodles, rinse them under cold water, and plunge them into an ice bath. This will stop the cooking process while washing away some of the starch.Now you\u2019re ready to sip and slurp your way to soba-induced bliss. Whether you\u2019re twirling these noodles into a delightfully chilled noodle salad or topping it with crispy cubes of tofu, go forth with pride, you soba star you.Get the recipe:Soba Soup With Shrimp and GreensDashi is the fastest route to a savory, slurp-able broth\u2014and there are no loooong simmers or bags of chicken bones necessary.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titSobaJapaneseRecipes you want to make.
