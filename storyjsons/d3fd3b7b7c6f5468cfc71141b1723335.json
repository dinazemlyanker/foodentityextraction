Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,I generally have a no-subway-on-the-weekends policy, but I ended up in the West Village last Saturday, a good 15 stops from my apartment in Brooklyn, and decided to make the best of it. It felt like the first real day of spring: People were drinking spritzes at sidewalk tables, dogs were romping in Washington Square Park, even the traffic cop writing tickets looked happy and relaxed. We ended up at King, which is the perfect restaurant for lots of occasions\u2014work lunches, date nights, parent visits\u2014but I think it\u2019s best on a weekend, specifically in the late afternoon.I\u2019m not talking about b----h, the meal I refuse to name let alone partake in. At King, the daytime menu is the same whether it\u2019s Tuesday or Sunday. There are no bottomless mimosas. You cannot order eggs.We started with a brilliantly pink endive salad with long shavings of ricotta salata and blood-orange wedges. Then came the pasta: a tangle of lemony taglierini streaked with barely wilted arugula. And finally the lombatello, a small, perfectly cooked hanger steak, served with a few spoonfuls of brothy borlotti beans and stems of chard. It was the perfect amount of food for two people (who both skipped breakfast). We ate lazily in the light-filled space. There was no line at the hostess\u2019s desk, no harried servers trying to turn tables. And as the clock pushed toward 4 p.m. we realized: This isn\u2019t lunch. It\u2019s the best way to have dinner on a Saturday in Manhattan.The ride home was a hellscape of delays, but at least we\u2019d gotten the other part right.This Week on HealthyishIs your wellness practice just a diet in disguise? Social scientist Melissa A. Fabello thinks we need to take a second look at all the things we do in the name of \u201chealth.\u201d Fariha R\u00f3is\u00edn talks to the founders of a new kind of healing space in Brooklyn, where all types of bodies can feel at home. And Aliza Abarbanel writes about the low- and no-waste stores cropping up around the city and whether they could be the future of retail...or just an inaccessible trend.My kind of comfort food.\nPhoto by Stephen Kent Johnson, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiWhat I\u2019m CookingIt\u2019s been a week of comfort food\u2014broccoli bolognese, lamb meatballs over rice\u2014and Seamless (I dream about my local Indian spot\u2019s Manchurian cauliflower). I have my heart set on this roasted salmon with salsa verde, maybe this weekend, and Priya Krishna\u2019s dahi toast. (If you haven\u2019t ordered Indian-ish yet, get on it!)What I\u2019m ReadingI thought I was going to hate-read this peloton instructor\u2019s work diary, but you know what? I appreciate her hustle. And her commitment to The Bachelor and getting nine hours of sleep. I\u2019m also making my way through The Cut\u2019s marriage series, and the transcript of a couples' therapy session reminds me of Esther Perel\u2019s \u201cWhere Should We Begin\u201d in the best way.What I\u2019m WatchingGame of Thrones and only Game of Thrones, because I challenged myself to watch all the seasons I missed before the new one airs. I missed\u2026a lot of seasons. What have I gotten myself into?Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish EditorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletterNew York CityessayRead MoreLifestyleOn Banning Celery Juice and Getting to SleepBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
