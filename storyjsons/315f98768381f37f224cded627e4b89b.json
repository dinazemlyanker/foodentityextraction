Next up is poet and author Elizabeth Acevedo, who celebrates Latinx culture with her award-winning young adult novels.\u201cThe thought of cooking helps me let go of the mixed-up feelings inside.\u201d These are the reflections of Emoni Santiago, the pensive teenage protagonist of With the Fire on High, Elizabeth Acevedo\u2019s latest bestselling YA novel. As Emoni juggles high school, part-time fast food shifts, and raising her two-year-old daughter, she finds peace in her grandmother\u2019s North Philly kitchen, cooking inventive dishes like fried green tomato Caprese with queso frito that reflect her African-American and Puerto Rican roots. When she whips up meals \u201cso good they\u2019d make you twerk something,\u201d she\u2019s trying to prove to the world (and to herself) that she can transform her daydreams into a delicious reality.Acevedo\u2019s first novel, The Poet X, won a National Book Award and the Carnegie Medal after its 2018 debut. Her next HarperTeen book, Clap When You Land, is set to drop in May 2020.The 31-year-old slam poet-turned-novelist gravitated toward writing at an early age, and competed in her first poetry slam at age 14. She went on to become a National Slam Champion in 2016 and has performed on stages around the globe, including Madison Square Garden and the Kennedy Center. Acevedo recalls writing the first draft of With the Fire on High as part of a National Novel Writing Month exercise in 2013. Back then, the poet saw the project as little more than a prose-writing experiment. Fast-forward to the present and she\u2019s adapting the coming-of-age novel into a screenplay for Picturestart.Food plays a key role in Acevedo\u2019s work, but growing up in Morningside Heights, she shied away from the kitchen, not wanting to compete with her Dominican mother\u2019s formidable cooking skills. \u201cMy ability to really start discerning flavors and different types of cuisine really started to happen because of moving [to D.C.],\u201d she says.These days, Acevedo\u2019s got the culinary skills to make anything from moro (the Dominican rice and beans dish) to a Thai curry, and does so whenever she needs a brain break. \u201cI love that it\u2019s a different kind of creativity than writing,\u201d she says of cooking. \u201cThere\u2019s not as much a \u2018brain\u2019 thing happening, as there is a \u2018hands, tastes, and colors\u2019 thing.\u201dWe spoke with the author about her favorite decompression dishes, her global palate, and her commitment to writing for teen audiences.When I was a teenager \u2026 I was already writing and sensed it was something that I loved and was good at, and that helped me to connect to other people in a way that was powerful. So, I think my dream then was to create a writer\u2019s life.I choose to focus on YA fiction because \u2026 I was an eighth grade English teacher and I just think it\u2019s a really exciting age group to write for. There\u2019s still some hope left in that age. Having been a teacher at a school that was predominantly Latinx, seeing what it does for young people to realize that a narrative can be lovingly told about them, that\u2019s really important to me.My favorite comfort food is \u2026  sancocho, this amazing stew that has all these root vegetables and cilantro and different kinds of meat in it. It\u2019s usually done as a Dominican stew of welcome. Also,  my mother makes really good fried eggs and sweet plantains. To this day, when I go home, that\u2019s the request I put in.I most enjoy cooking for \u2026  my husband. At this point, I think he\u2019s scared because I\u2019ll cook something and watch him eat it like, \u2018You better say it\u2019s great!\u2019 But he\u2019s one of my favorite audiences because he\u2019s seen the growth of a lot of my dishes.When I cook, I like to listen to \u2026  salsa and bachata. A lot of Marc Anthony, Aventura, Romeo Santos, La India, and all the things I grew up listening to. And these days, I\u2019m really enjoying Lizzo \u2014 joyous music that\u2019s going to make me stop and sing into a spoon.My go-to food spots in D.C. are \u2026 Nooshi and Soi 38, because I love a lot of Thai; Los Hermanos, this cafeteria-style Dominican spot that\u2019s no-frills; and Ambar, which is this Balkan small plates restaurant. Also, The Spice Suite is this fragrant shop where you can buy all these unique flavors imported from all over the world. Even though it\u2019s not a restaurant, it\u2019s my favorite \u201cfood\u201d place in the city.The last book I read was \u2026 Dominicana__ by Angie Cruz. It\u2019s a beautiful generational love story about a woman who leaves the Dominican Republic, moves to New York, and it just doesn\u2019t turn out how she imagined.My next book focuses on \u2026 two sisters who don\u2019t know about each other until after their father dies in a plane crash. It\u2019s a dual narrative. One sister\u2019s in the Dominican Republic and one\u2019s in New York City. It\u2019s all about what happens when you\u2019re grieving someone and you\u2019re also having to deal with the consequences of the life they lived.Besides cooking, I like to unwind by \u2026 spin cycling. It\u2019s just somebody telling me how fast to move, when to get up, when to pretend I\u2019m jumping. It\u2019s so comforting to hand over all my thoughts and just do.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishPerson of InterestInterviewsRead MoreLifestyleGlory Edim on How Eggs Fuel Her Mornings and How Stories Change the WorldBy Ali FrancisRecipes you want to make.
