She was mixing bitter black tea with velvety condensed milk, popularly known in Malaysia and Singapore as \u201cteh tarik\u201d, or \u201cpulled tea\u201d in Malay. Without the comforting elixir, our roti prata and curry breakfast was incomplete, she cautioned. My brother and I gulped down our servings enthusiastically, getting a satisfying sugar high from the sweetened milk and a jolt from the caffeinated black tea\u2014a perfect antidote for kids who dragged their feet while getting ready for school.These days, with Malaysian and Singaporean cuisine gaining popularity and recognition in the United States (and no longer being reduced or misunderstood by Westerners simply as \u201cAsian food\u201d), teh tarik is making its way into the bellies of nostalgia-thirsty immigrants and eager foodies. Moonlynn Tsai and Kyo Pang, the owners of Kopitiam, an all-day Malaysian cafe nestled in New York City\u2019s bustling Chinatown, tell me that teh tarik is one of the most popular items on their drink menu.At Kopitium, pulled tea is made-to-order and poured between two mugs at least four times .\nPhoto by Chelsea Kyle\u201cFor many, [teh tarik] reminds them of their childhood and the generation above them,\u201d says Moonlynn Tsai. \u201cWe\u2019ve had many adult guests, around my grandparents\u2019 age, who\u2019ve come in and shared stories about how their grandparents would make it for them in the mornings and right before bed.\u201dEven though teh tarik is a simple drink with only two or three ingredients (depending on the family recipe), the art of manually pulling the tea and milk into one luscious and frothy concoction comes with no shortcuts or machines. At Kopitiam, there are no pre-mixed batches of teh tarik; each drink is made-to-order.\u201cWe\u2019re in a day and age where the goal of everything is to see what can make the drink faster and faster,\u201d Tsai says. \u201cHaving to brew and wait while only using metal pitchers and tea sock strainers to create this delicious drink\u2014there\u2019s beauty in that.\u201dKyo Pang, the culinary mastermind behind Kopitiam, grew up in Penang, Malaysia and comes from a lineage of kopitiam owners. She teaches her staff to use the teh tarik recipe and technique she inherited from her family. Pang and Tsai explain that there\u2019s a strong symbiotic relationship between the black tea and the condensed and evaporated milks. They use BOH Daun Teh,  which is comprised of the tea dust, not leaves; it\u2019s steeped for about three minutes (the tea dust is strained using a tea sock). At home, you can pour the steeped tea into a stainless steel jug, large mug, or even small saucepan. Whatever vessel you choose, make sure it has a curved lip, which will ease pouring, limit spilling, and keep you from digging out the first aid kit to treat burns. Then add about two tablespoons of sweetened condensed milk and half a tablespoon of evaporated milk to your vessel of choice.The final drink is deliciously frothy.\nPhoto by Chelsea Kyle\u201cPulling\u201d the tea involves pouring it back and forth briskly from one jug or mug into another at least four times so that air can mix with the liquid and create teh tarik\u2019s trademark foamy head. More of a visual learner? Here\u2019s a great demo of \u201cpulling\u201d with a saucepan and mug.  Maybe one day you\u2019ll get to Mr. Teh Tarik's expert level. But, again, to avoid scalding yourself, ease into the pulling technique. Once you get a hang of it, you can gradually lift the mugs or pitchers higher. The more pulls you do, the fuller the flavor and the more the tea cools. (If you pull too many times, you might end up with a cooler than lukewarm tea. A maximum of five pulls seems to be the magic number.)So instead of reaching for that Keurig button to get your fix of caffeine, why not steep black tea\u2014 English Breakfast, Lipton, or Ceylon works great if tea dust is hard to find\u2014and open up those dusty cans of condensed and evaporated milk in your pantry? Pulling tea is an excellent way to impress your holiday guests...or you could take it easy and order a round of warm teh tarik at a Malaysian joint near you.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishTeaTrendsRead MoreLifestyleThe New All-Day Cafe That Feels Like It\u2019s Been There ForeverBy Jasmine LeeRecipes you want to make.
