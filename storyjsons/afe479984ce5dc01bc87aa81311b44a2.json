This base recipe makes a 10\" cake, but we also provide instructions on making a larger three-tiered cake (pictured) in case you\u2019re feeding a crowd!IngredientsMakes one 10\" cakeLemon CakeNonstick vegetable oil spray3\u00bccups cake flour1Tbsp. baking powder1\u00bdtsp. kosher salt2cups sugar2lemons, zest finely grated (about 2 Tbsp.) and juiced (about \u00bd cup)1cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into pieces, room temperature4large eggs, room temperature4large egg yolks, room temperature2tsp. vanilla extract\u00bdtsp. almond extract\u00bccup vegetable oil1\u00bccups whole milkVanilla Buttercream5large egg whites1cup sugar\u00bdtsp. kosher salt\u00bctsp. cream of tartar1\u00bdcups (3 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into pieces, room temperature2tsp. vanilla bean paste or extractFilling and Assembly\u00bccup St.-Germain (elderflower liqueur)\u00bccup fresh lemon juice\u2154cup raspberry jamPreparationLemon CakeStep 1Arrange a rack in center of oven and preheat to 350\u00b0. Coat bottom and sides of two 10\" round cake pans with cooking spray. Line bottoms with parchment paper.Step 2Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Combine sugar and lemon zest in another medium bowl and massage with your fingertips until mixture is very fragrant and looks like wet sand, about 1 minute.Step 3Beat butter in the large bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until smooth, then add sugar mixture. Beat on medium-high speed, scraping down sides of bowl occasionally, until mixture is extremely light and fluffy, 6\u20138 minutes.Step 4Reduce mixer speed to medium and beat in eggs one at a time, incorporating each fully before adding the next. Scrape down sides again to make sure all ingredients are incorporated. Beat in egg yolks and vanilla and almond extracts. Reduce mixer speed to low and slowly stream in oil; scrape sides again (this is important because it\u2019s a high volume of batter).Step 5Add dry ingredients in three additions, alternating with milk in two additions, beginning and ending with dry ingredients. Slowly stream in lemon juice (at this point the batter might look a little curdled, which is normal). Remove bowl from mixer and fold several times by hand with a flexible spatula, scraping bottom and sides to make sure batter is evenly mixed.Step 6Divide batter evenly between prepared pans and smooth top.Step 7Bake cakes with pans side by side, rotating positions halfway through, until centers spring back and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 35-40 minutes. Note: This cake will still look relatively pale when fully baked.Step 8Let cakes cool in pans 10 minutes. Cut around sides with a thin knife and invert onto wire racks; remove parchment. Let cakes cool completely.Vanilla ButtercreamStep 9Combine egg whites, sugar, salt, and cream of tartar in a large heatproof bowl. Set bowl over a large saucepan filled with 1\" of gently simmering water (make sure bottom of bowl is not touching water). Warm egg white mixture, whisking constantly (the sugar will help prevent the whites from cooking), until sugar is dissolved, mixture is thick and opaque, and an instant-read thermometer registers 160\u00b0, 5\u20138 minutes (this pasteurizes the egg).Step 10Scrape mixture into the bowl of stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat on high speed until a dense, fluffy meringue forms and sides and bottom of bowl are cool to the touch, 8\u201310 minutes.Step 11Add butter one piece at a time, beating thoroughly to incorporate before adding the next. Be patient and don\u2019t be alarmed if mixture starts to look curdled or soupy (depending on temperature of butter and meringue). Just keep beating until it comes together, which can take 8\u201312 minutes. When you\u2019ve added all the butter and buttercream is smooth and silky, beat in vanilla. Cover with plastic until ready to use (you should have about 4 cups).Step 12Do Ahead: If using same day, let buttercream sit covered at room temperature. Buttercream can be made 2 days ahead. Transfer to an airtight container and chill. Let come to room temperature, then beat with paddle attachment in stand mixer until smooth.Filling and AssemblyStep 13Position cooled cake layers on a flat surface, domed side down. Using a long serrated knife and long back-and-forth strokes, cut cakes in half lengthwise (this is called \u201ctorting\u201d) to form 4 layers. Lift off top halves; set aside.Step 14Stir St.-Germain and lemon juice in a small bowl. Using a pastry brush, dab all over cut sides of bottom layers. You want a light, even soaking.Step 15Using a small offset spatula, spread a thin layer of raspberry jam over soaked cake. Start with a couple of tablespoons, then add more as needed to cover surface (you want to avoid excess jam squeezing out the sides). Arrange reserved cake layers back on top, cut sides down. Set aside the flatter, more even reassembled cake for the top. Brush top of remaining cake with St.-Germain mixture and spread with jam. Place on a platter or cake stand (it\u2019s helpful to place strips of parchment around sides of platter and slightly underneath cake to keep platter clean during frosting). Stack reserved cake on top, creating a 4-layer cake separated by 3 layers of jam.Step 16Spread a thin, even layer of buttercream over top and around sides of cake. The idea is just to fill in any gaps and even out the sides where the layers may not align perfectly, so it\u2019s fine if  cake is visible beneath buttercream. This is called the crumb coating because it adheres any loose crumbs to the cake so the second layer of frosting is smooth. Chill cake until icing is firm, about 10 minutes.Step 17Spread a generous layer of buttercream over the crumb coating (although you don\u2019t need to use all the buttercream). For loose swooshes and swirls, use the back of a spoon or a small offset spatula. For a more finished look, use the straightedge of a metal bench scraper to smooth sides and top. Decorate cake with fresh flowers, if desired.Step 18Chill cake until ready to serve but allow several hours for cake to reach room temperature before serving.Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Claire Saffitz, Prop Styling by Emily EisenStep 19Do Ahead: Cake can be made 1 day ahead. Chill, then once icing is hardened, cover loosely with plastic.Instructions for making a large three-tiered cake:Step 20If you\u2019re making a larger tiered version, you will need to double all of the components (the cake batter, the buttercream, and filling components). If you have a standard-size stand mixer, this means making two separate batches each of cake batter and buttercream.Step 21You will need one 10\", one 8\", and one 6\" cake pan. Prepare three different pans as above, then divide batter so it fills each pan to the same height. Bake cakes until centers spring back and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, checking the smallest pan for doneness after about 25 minutes.Step 22Once cakes are cooling out of their pans, REPEAT baking process with second batch of batter so you have two cakes of each size.Step 23Assemble each tier as described in recipe above, splitting and filling each individual layer and then filling and stacking two layers to make three 4-layer cakes. Note: it can be tricky to split the 10\" cakes since they have a lower profile. Feel free to skip this step for the largest tier and just keep it two layers.Step 24We recommend assembling each tier on a cake round of the corresponding size, which will make assembly easier (cake rounds are available on Amazon, at Michaels, or a cake decorating store).Step 25Crumb coat and ice the three layers, reserving about \u00bd cup buttercream for final decorations. Chill cakes until icing is hardened.Step 26Trim 3 plastic drinking straws so they\u2019re exactly the same height as the 10\" tier. Press straws straight down into cake about 3\" in from edge and spacing evenly around cake. Repeat for 8\" tier. This adds support for the layers when you stack them.Step 27Place bottom tier on cake stand or platter (which you can do easily when the whole cake is on a cake round), then carefully stack 8\" cake over top, followed by 6\" cake.Step 28Use reserved frosting to pipe small pearls around bottoms of each tier to cover cake rounds. Decorate with fresh flowers.Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Claire Saffitz, Prop Styling by Emily EisenPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Claire Saffitz, Prop Styling by Emily EisenHow would you rate Lemon and Raspberry Wedding Cake with Vanilla Buttercream ?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (5)Back to TopTriangleI'm wanting to make this for a friend birthday who loves wedding cake! Could I sub the lemon juice for water to make an unflavored wedding cake?Raegan2/3/2021I made the cake portion of this and subbed out the frosting for a different one, but the cake was phenomenal! It was light and very easy flavor. If you\u2019re looking for a stronger lemon flavor I would advise adding a bit more lemon juice, but pairing it with a lemon frosting it was the perfect about!Nebraska6/11/2020This cake was great! It has an extreme amount of butter, which makes it comically heavy, but it was very tasty. The cake itself came out quite dense, so if you are looking for a lighter, fluffier cake, consider a different recipe. julia5813arlington, va 12/9/2019I did not actually make this particular one, but instead, one from the June 1997 issue with the stunning and very similar cake on the cover. I made 1/2 recipe in 1999 for my daughter\u2019s wedding shower, and can tell you, it\u2019s fabulous. I got so many compliments and have looked for an excuse to make it again, but sadly no one else has gotten married! I did use the method and 1/4 amounts for the syrup, filling, and an Italian buttercream to make my youngest daughter and me a birthday cake this weekend (September 2019). It\u2019s not assembled yet, but it\u2019s components are chilling until later today. I\u2019m glad I kept this for 22 years, and so happy with the results (so far). Even if it breaks apart and has to be eaten in a bowl, it\u2019s superb! Saginaw, Michigan 9/7/2019I would make this again! In fact, I'm going to make the three tiered version for my wedding.  It was light and refreshing and perfect for summer wedding. \n\nI do have questions for Claire! I'm feeding this cake to children. Can I do elderflower syrup instead of the liquor? Also, do you know how tall the finished tiered cake is? karisanancySan Francisco, CA6/9/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titCandyDessertLemonCitrusFruitBakingRecipes you want to make.
