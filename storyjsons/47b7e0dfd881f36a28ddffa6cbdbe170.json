Typically the fruits used are dried, and the soaking process long, but ripe, in-season berries only need a few minutes to mingle with booze and sugar before they become something dazzling: a syrupy topping for a not-so-typical summer sundae that allows me to escape to the tropics, even for a few moments. You can also serve this boozy no-cook sauce on top of cornmeal pancakes or French toast, alongside hot buttered biscuits, or over slices of pound cake. Or add a teaspoon to sparkling wine for an easy brunch cocktail. \u2014Chrissy TraceyRelated: The Case for Quitting Meat with Sarah Jampel and Chrissy TraceyContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.This recipe is part of Short Is Sweet, our collection of summer dishes that deliver a whole lot of deliciousness in 30 minutes or less.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.
