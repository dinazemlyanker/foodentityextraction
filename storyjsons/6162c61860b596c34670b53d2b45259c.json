Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,We have to talk about snacks.But first, update from last week\u2019s newsletter: Thanks to all your feedback, I got myself a budget on YNAB. I\u2019m four days in, have attended three live webinars, and am thoroughly invested (yes, that\u2019s a pun).Given my newfound obsession with budgeting, this story about how our bodies have budgets really spoke to me. Just like my shiny, new spreadsheet of dollars and cents, our brains manage all our bodily accounts\u2014hormone levels, metabolic resources, other things I don\u2019t understand. And they do a really good job of budgeting in advance of the challenge:\u201cIf a demanding situation is predicted, then the brain marshals the body\u2019s resources\u2014changing blood pressure, secreting hormones, metabolizing glucose, and so on\u2014to begin to meet those needs before they arise.\u201dBut, as the article explains, if we\u2019re always psyching ourselves up for future demands, we\u2019re setting ourselves up for all kinds of physical and mental health problems. The prospects are even worse for people who experience chronic stress \u201cdue to social issues like financial hardship, divorce, or racism.\u201dThe point is: If we don\u2019t allow our brains to replenish our bodies' stores, we'll stop spending on all non-essential line items\u2014learning, exercising, having fun, being creative, falling in love. Yikes!One of the ways I\u2019m trying to replenish is by checking in with my body more often throughout the day. Does it need to drink water? Stand up? Pee? (Yes, this is a thing I forget to do all the time.) This week, I\u2019ve been hungrier than usual thanks to an uptick in exercise, so I\u2019ve found myself reaching for more snacks.My default \u201csnack\u201d has always been nut butter straight from the jar. (Current roster in my desk drawer: Ground Up, Rx, Big Spoon Roasters.) It\u2019s a quick and delicious way to curb midday hunger, though, in the last year, I\u2019ve extended my snacking to nut butter bars: ProBars, Perfect bars, more Big Spoon Roasters, and the like. This is all a big wind-up to my point, which is that, this week, Basically editor and Healthyish columnist Sarah Jampel made my dreams come true with a homemade nut butter bar recipe. It\u2019s everything I want in a bar: soft, dense, and just-sweet-enough, with plenty of nut butter plus fun stuff like pumpkin seeds and dried fruit.They\u2019re a great snack, sure. But I\u2019ll definitely eat them for breakfast, and, on those full-throttle, no-end-in-sight days like today, it\u2019s a safe bet they\u2019ll work as lunch.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish EditorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletterSnackessayRead MoreLifestyleIt's Good to Be BackBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
