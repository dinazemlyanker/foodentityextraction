And until several weeks ago, when I dreamt up that roast chicken, it looked exactly like the roast chicken I\u2019ve been making my whole life: A beautifully burnished, platonic ideal of a roast chicken, simply seasoned and cooked at 425\u00b0 for 45 minutes or so, ensuring that incredibly addictive crispy skin.But then this Slow-Roast Gochujang Chicken entered my life and changed everything\u2014 I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say that it has me rethinking my plans for my final meal. A different kind of roast chicken, it\u2019s cooked low and slow instead of hot and fast. But it\u2019s worth investing the time because what emerges from the oven is lightyears greater than the sum of its parts.And about those parts. First, there\u2019s the absurdly simple glaze. All you have to do is whisk together a few tablespoons of gochujang and olive oil with some grated garlic and ginger. Full stop. Basta. C\u2019est tout! The spicy, crimson-red mixture then gets brushed generously over the chicken and nestled into a cast-iron skillet on top of the second part: a few pounds of baby Yukon Gold potatoes.The whole set-up is cooked at 300\u00b0 to make magic happen\u2014and, I\u2019m telling you, magic happens. Two and a half hours later, a lacquered, rust-colored bird appears, with meat so tender that you barely need a knife to carve it. Beneath it, the perfectly tender potatoes, which have confited in its spicy, schmaltzy drippings.This is a bird that eats more like a rotisserie chicken than a roast chicken. The low temperature gently cooks the meat so that neither the leg nor the breast suffers in service of the other. And what it lacks in crispy skin, it makes up for in fall-apart tender meat. Take it from a crispy skin fanatic: You won\u2019t miss it. The sticky, spicy deeply flavorful glaze more than makes up for it.If I haven\u2019t already convinced you of the epic proportion of this chicken, rest assured that it requires no more effort than any other roast chicken recipe you may have made in the past. The only additional ingredient you\u2019ll need to reach roast chicken nirvana is time. And surely you can find some of that in the name of trying a dish that\u2019s worthy of being your last.Get the recipe:Slow-Roast Gochujang ChickenThis isn\u2019t the crisp-skinned, high-heat-roast chicken you\u2019re probably familiar with. Instead, it\u2019s a melt-in-your-mouth tender, schmaltzy, slow-roast version.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titroast chickenRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
