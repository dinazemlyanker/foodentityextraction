Up next: Setting up a successful garden, even if it\u2019s all indoors.A bouquet of floppy scallions is quietly regenerating from its roots on my windowsill, next to a stout leafy plant that, in a previous life, was nothing more than a slimy avocado pit. I don\u2019t have a backyard or even a fire escape to call my own, but I\u2019m still driven to grow things, and I\u2019m not alone. The past few months have seen a resurgence of interest in gardening\u2014as a coping mechanism, a way to strengthen community resiliency, a screen-free source of entertainment, and an ultra-local food system.\u201cWhen quarantine hit and shelves were empty, I was really thankful that we didn\u2019t have to go out and I was glad that I already had some summer plants going,\u201d says L.A.-based food photographer and avid gardener Jeni Afuso. About 200-square-feet of her concrete-covered backyard is packed with planters overflowing with okra, shishito peppers, and Sungold tomatoes. It\u2019s a produce lover\u2019s paradise, with benefits that go deeper than dinner. \u201cGardening connects me to my great-grandfather who emigrated from Okinawa to work on the sugar cane fields in Hawaii; my grandfather, who was a Japanese gardener and landscaper in San Fernando Valley in the 1950s; and my late father, who enjoyed gardening with a curious soul,\u201d says Afuso.The appeal is obvious, but the obstacles to growing your own food can seem daunting\u2014especially for people like myself with limited access to outdoor space. Unwilling to accept defeat, I turned to passionate backyard gardeners like Afuso and Dominique Drakeford, sustainability influencer and founder of Sustainable Brooklyn, plus farmer and horticulturalist Amber Tamm, to create a blueprint for anyone who wants to develop a green thumb. Before you hit up the local nursery, ask yourself these questions:What\u2019s my sunlight and space situation?Forget your heirloom tomato craving for now: Light, space, and seasonality dictate what you can successfully grow. \u201cWhether you have yard access or an apartment, observe how the sun is hitting your windows or how the sun arches over the land to figure out where to plant what,\u201d says Tamm. \u201cYou don't want brassicas like kale in super sunny spots, that\u2019s more for tomatoes. Figure out what you can grow, not what you want to grow.\u201dStart tracking light just after the sun rises, then note if each area is in full sun, dappled sun, partial shade, or full shade every hour until sundown. For indoor plants, The Sill recommends a quick shadow test: Hold a piece of paper parallel to your preferred window around midday, then hold your free hand about a foot above the sheet of paper. A sharp shadow means bright light; a softer shadow means softer light.Next, focus on space. The soil beneath grassy yards can be transformed into fertile ground with time and fertilizer, and cement-covered rooftops, balconies, or backyards can be outfitted with earth-filled containers. If you\u2019re constricted to counter space alone, don\u2019t despair. Herbs, microgreens, and sprouts can flourish indoors. Wheatgrass can be sprouted from seeds in a few days then planted in a pot (or repurposed container) stationed in bright sunlight; pea shoots will grow in covered trays with no sunlight required; herbs like basil, thyme, and oregano flourish in window sills. Sprouted potatoes can even be propagated in repurposed, dirt-filled garbage cans\u2014no planters or garden required.What will I actually eat?There\u2019s no point in planting cilantro if you think it tastes like soap. After mapping out your light and space, head to a local nursery, farmers\u2019 market, or seed resource to assess your options based on the current stage of each growing season, and don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions.If local options aren\u2019t meeting your needs, there\u2019s always the internet. \u201cKitazawa Seed Co has been a vital connection to my heritage,\u201d says Afuso. \u201cThey have so many seeds for Asian vegetable varietals that are nonexistent here in the US, even at Japanese markets. I started with the vegetables we bought at the Japanese market, like komatsuna and mizuna, because I was tired of going every week. We saved so much money not going to the market, we saved a lot of gas, and a lot of Japanese vegetables are sold pre-bagged, so it was nice not seeing as much plastic in the house.\u201dWhat will I plant in?\u201cPeople get caught up in tools and pots, and I want to emphasize how to utilize recyclable items,\u201d says Tamm. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the best ways to start.\u201d Turn milk cartons into herb gardens by flipping them sideways and cutting circular holes for planting, start seeds in pint-size berry containers, and drill drainage holes in the bottom of large cans to accommodate solitary herbs.If you decide to buy some containers, be strategic about your surface area. Raised vegetable beds help maximize space but can get pricey. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to commit to building a raised bed so we bought $1.50 planters at Daiso as I needed and also some five gallon nursery pots, which ended up being less expensive,\u201d says Afuso.How will I learn?Nature is unpredictable, especially for beginners, so it\u2019s essential to find good gardening resources to supplement your own instincts. \u201cI followed certain YouTube channels like Epic Gardening and Cali Kim, and read Farming While Black by Leah Penniman, but a lot of it was trial and error and understanding that a lot of it comes down to creating healthy soil,\u201d says Drakeford, who upped her soil game with a worm-powered backyard compost bin.Tamm shares tips from her favorite farmers through her blog, Voices from the Garden, but also encourages beginners to take their own notes. \u201cInherently, on a cellular level, we know how to grow food; we've just forgotten or don\u2019t have the time to remember,\u201d she says. \u201cUse this time to remember and create an index of what works and doesn't work for your space.\u201cIn this spirit, Afuso organizes her in-the-garden observations in a meticulous spreadsheet, tracking germination temperature, notes on which plants need vertical support, and other reminders for the years to come. \u201cI\u2019m going to be growing food for the rest of our lives,\u201d she says.My own indoor garden is just beginning to progress past the row of herbs on my windowsill, thanks to a notebook packed with plans for pea shoots, mung bean sprouts, and other achievable projects for my space (indoor) and light (strong, but filtered). The final pages are itemized with information on purple bok choy, sturdy Tuscan kale, endless heirloom tomatoes, and other al fresco dreams. This sprawling garden is, for now, purely imaginary, but the exercise itself has given me a new perspective on food systems\u2014one that other gardeners share.\u201cI\u2019ve always been an advocate for farmers, but being able to have my hands touch soil and understand what it feels like to grow on a very small scale, I'm even more inspired to speak on behalf of farmers and amplify the work of those who are disenfranchised, systematically targeted, or aren\u2019t getting paid fairly in the space,\u201d says Drakeford. \u201cIt\u2019s equally important to be advocating for farmers and using your power, privilege, knowledge, and experiences to fight for food access and land sovereignty.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishIt's Getting Hot in HereRead MoreLifestyleHow to Stop Making Excuses and Start Composting AlreadyBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
