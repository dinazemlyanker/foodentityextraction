The alguashte adds a deep nuttiness and crunchy texture.\u201dIngredients4 Servings2Tbsp. coriander seeds3medium tomatoes (about 1 lb.), coarsely chopped1medium onion, coarsely chopped6garlic cloves3jalape\u00f1os, coarsely chopped1bunch cilantro, stems and leaves separated1Tbsp. achiote (annatto) seeds or 2 tsp. powder3Tbsp. vegetable oil\u00bdcup plus 2 Tbsp.
