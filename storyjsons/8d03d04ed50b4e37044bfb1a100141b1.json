While it\u2019s getting to a rollable temperature, I\u2019ll head to the Y to sweat my ass off. I\u2019ll spin on a bike for 30-ish minutes. I\u2019ll do an interval workout that leaves my face cranberry sauce red, my thighs burning like brussels sprouts forgotten in the oven, and a puddle of sweat on the floor that has no Thanksgiving food comparison. After, I\u2019ll be pumped with energy and endorphins. I\u2019ll feel strong and happy as I do when I work out on any Thursday morning.But I will not under any circumstances call this workout a \u201cturkey burn\"\u2014or a TORQUEY BURN, as FlyWheel is calling it. \u201cI WOKE UP IN FEAST MODE\u201d already has a waitlist. Peloton offers incredibly popular turkey burn rides, bootcamps, yoga flows, and runs. One Friday-after Thanksgiving turkey burn Bar Method class I came across was 15 minutes longer than usual, which adds insult to injury. If you search #turkeyburn on Instagram you\u2019ll come up with a lot of clip arty turkeys on row machines or quivering under heavy barbells advertising local gym classes. (Important sidenote: The turkey trot is exempt from criticism because it\u2019s a family-time running race\u2014no trainers will be yelling about your mashed potato thighs while you run around the freezing park.)I don\u2019t ride for tacos, turkey, or permission to eat. I don\u2019t spend 30 minutes listening to mediocre remixes to assuage my food guilt. And yet trainers and gyms and fitness apps love to reinforce this bullshit. I want it to stop! It\u2019s illogical, patronizing, and a subconscious way to make us feel bad about our bodies even as we turn those pedals, doing the exact thing (exercise!) that medical experts and Sanjay Gupta told us to do in order to live longer, healthier lives.Instead, the turkey burn narrative divides the day into two parts. Part one: you exercise and are Good. Part two: you eat gravy and are Bad. But Thanksgiving is just the peg for this article\u2014my rant continues year-round. I\u2019ve had a yoga instructor joke, mid-flow, to \u201creach for those tacos!\u201d when we were doing a balance, stretching our arms towards the wall in front of us. In this great article on The Cut about the cult of Peloton, two usernames stuck out: @ridefordonuts, @rideforchardonnay. Every time you log in you have to feel bad about donuts?! Devastating! I have a friend who read the back of a tortilla package and told me how many minutes on the treadmill it\u2019d take for her to undo the pleasure of eating it. That broke my damn heart. Don\u2019t get me started on the postpartum workouts that make women feel fat for embarking on the hardest journey of their life thus far. Even I\u2019m not immune: I\u2019ll take the nine-flight climb to our Test Kitchen to lessen the guilt of taste-testing a holiday cookie. Workout, good. Eating, bad. But eating is so, so good! IT IS MY LIFE.Mathematically and biologically speaking, no workout class is going to undo a giant plate of Norman Rockwell-perfect turkey. Exercise isn\u2019t a magic eraser to Parker House rolls of belly fat. The time and effort required to work off significant calories is A LOT OF TIME. MUCH EXERTION. VERY DIFFICULT. If you recognize that, the turkey burn class is even more frustrating. \u201cYeah, I burned off what, a single stolen sheaf of crispy skin?\u201d The guilt compounds. You\u2019ll never do enough.Most medical experts will tell you that weight loss and maintenance is about making a personal food-intake change, whether that\u2019s decreasing portion sizes or cutting out super processed food and added sugar. In fact, when people reward themselves with extra food on days they exercise, some end up gaining weight. (I used to drive through KFC after swim practice to pick up a mashed potato \u201cFamous Bowl\u201d in high school, I know all about it. I almost bought the gym duffel that says, \u201cAfter This We\u2019re Getting Tacos.\u201d)You should exercise for heart health, to build core strength that\u2019ll support you as you age and protect your back. You should exercise to stave off depression and combat stress. You should exercise to help you sleep. You should exercise to have a moment to yourself, despite the shitty remixes blasting in your ears. You should not exercise to punish yourself for enjoying squishy glazed donuts once a month.I exercise to get strong and to keep my mood up. (Okay, and to show off my Aperol water bottle and to use the Y\u2019s steam room.) I eat to fuel my body as deliciously as possible, as healthily as I can stand it. And on Thanksgiving, I\u2019m only feeling happiness when I dive bomb into my slice of home-freaking-made pecan pie. I didn\u2019t earn it. I certainly didn\u2019t burn it. I made it, and it\u2019s fucking awesome.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishThanksgivingessayRead MoreLifestyleForget the Fancy Fitness Studios, Zumba Is the Only Exercise Class I NeedBy Flora TsapovskyRecipes you want to make.
