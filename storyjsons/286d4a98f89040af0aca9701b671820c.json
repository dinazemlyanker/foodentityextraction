It makes me emotional. Eating it inspires the same warmth as the most important human connections in my life. On multiple occasions, I have walked into the vegetarian burger joint, purchased a scoop of each flavor, exited the shop, and walked a circle around the block while enjoying my spoils\u2014only to return a few minutes later to purchase another cup. To be fair, this is nothing new. I\u2019ve been pulling that move for the past four years, ever since the East Village pillar opened for business. And so have a lot of others in this hungry city.We all have Brooks Headley\u2014Superiority Burger\u2019s chef and owner\u2014to thank for that. He makes one gelato and one sorbet each day. Sometimes it\u2019s raspberry sorbet and a date shake gelato. Sometimes it\u2019s coconut gelato and tangerine sorbet. Sometimes it\u2019s strawberry sorbet and labneh gelato.But at the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t really matter what flavors he\u2019s working with. The gelato will always be intensely creamy and flavored in a way that is both familiar and boundary-pushing. The sorbet will be tart and fresh, as if you tripped face first into a stall at the farmers\u2019 market. And together in one cup, they work like veteran Olympic ping pong doubles partners, slapping flavor around the inside of your mouth until\u2014in a euphoric daze\u2014you finish your walk around the block and stumble back into the burger shop for another glorious serving.Go there: Superiority BurgerExplore Bon App\u00e9titNew York CityIce CreamSorbetHighly RecommendGelatoRead MorecultureThis Tahini Gelato Is What All Tahini Desserts Aspire ToBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
