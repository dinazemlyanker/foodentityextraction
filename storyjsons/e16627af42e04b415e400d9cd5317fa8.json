Sure, I\u2019m down with kombucha and attend weekly vinyasa yoga, but show me a crystal, and I\u2019ll call it a rock. I do not believe in vibrations, and positive thinking does nothing for my road rage.Wellness has an especially firm foothold in the beauty industry, what with jade rollers and rose quartz-infused products, and, as a beauty writer, I\u2019ve been feeling the fatigue. So when I learned that the mother of adaptogens Amanda Chantal Bacon had created a new skincare collection, Beauty Shroom, I sighed so loudly that my boyfriend thought I was mad at him. For the founder of chain juice shops in LA that sell powdered supplements called \u201cMoon Dust,\u201d a beauty line at Sephora seemed inevitable...and maybe a little opportunistic.But as someone who prides herself on knowing what's up in every corner of the beauty world, I was curious. In other words, I had to try it. The Exfoliating Acid Potion ($39) features a blend of acids (glycolic, lactic, salicylic) and reishi mushrooms. The watery formula felt nice on a humid day, and it felt gentle, a little too much so for me. (To be fair, I dunk my face in 15% glycolic acid every night, and I\u2019ve grown to love the sting.)Moon Juice's vegan collagen protection and plumping jelly serum.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigThe Plumping Jelly Serum ($58) is no misnomer. It has an herbal scent that\u2019s an upgrade from the antioxidant serum I usually use, which smells like a fish ate Brie before dying in the bottle. I couldn\u2019t tell if my face looked smoother\u2014few things short of a needle will fix my baby laugh lines\u2014but my skin did feel softer and more hydrated after a few days. The magic ingredients are the reishi and silver-eared mushrooms, which bring the purported stress-reducing, energy-boosting adaptogenic powder that made Moon Dust so famous. \u201cThey help with inflammation and stress in the skin on a cellular level,\u201d explains Bacon.Rounding out the line is Vegan Collagen Protection ($58), an ingestible powder. The supplement contains trenella mushrooms and a type of vitamin E that helps preserve collagen\u2014and doubles as a great milk substitute, according to Bacon. She\u2019s right: While my boyfriend said it looked like baby formula, it tasted like watered-down nut milk. I followed the instructions, mixing two tablespoons of the powder with six ounces of water (although you could swap in matcha tea, a green smoothie, or coffee, depending on your level of enlightenment).Its benefits are mostly preventative so, understandably, my skin didn\u2019t take on a preternatural glow. (I\u2019ll revisit that after a year or two.) I actually enjoyed it, and could easily pair it with cereal in the morning. But one thing bugged me. Not only does the jar last just a month with that serving size\u2014a pricy milk substitute for sure\u2014but also: What was it doing that Beauty Dust wasn\u2019t?\u201cAt the heart of the Beauty Dust is adaptogens,\u201d Bacon explains. \u201cThe Vegan Collagen helps specifically with boosting your body\u2019s own collagen production, reducing fine lines, and keeping the elasticity in your skin.\u201d (Translation: If your skin is trashed from pulling all-nighters at the office, go for stress-reducing Beauty Dust. If it\u2019s just gravity doing its thing, take the Vegan Collagen. If you\u2019re not sure but got a tax refund, you can take both, as Bacon does.)Still, I wanted to know why Bacon had branched out into topical beauty products before I finished calibrating my BS meter. I mean, she once said in an interview that she didn\u2019t use sunscreen. (\u201cI wish that I had now, I do,\u201d she says.) She\u2019s also known for her bare-bones beauty routine, and admitted to me that it\u2019s typically bar soap, a healthy diet, and the occasional oil.If Bacon had told me her reason for creating the collection was that she\u2019d discovered some magic cure-all ingredient, or because Moon Juice fans kept asking for it, she would have confirmed my doubts. Because while wellness is supposedly above the mainstream fray, it\u2019s still the wellness industry\u2014there\u2019s got to be some sort of financial incentive for it, right? Even the holiest of meditation apps, Headspace, charges a monthly fee to share enlightenment. Ashwagandha doesn't come for free\u2014unless you're growing it in your backyard.But Bacon has the most relatable\u2014and plausible\u2014reason for her new venture: \u201cI hit my mid-30s and began to notice some changes in my skin.\u201d So she began using Biologique Recherche\u2019s P50 Lotion, the cult-favorite chemical exfoliant known for its acrid smell, harsh active ingredients, and insanely good results\u2014and loved it. \u201cOnce I saw the effects and it worked that well, I thought, I can\u2019t not use this now,\u201d she said.But she couldn\u2019t get on board with the not-so-natural formulation. So she set about developing a Moon Juice-y version\u2014and thus the Exfoliating Acid Potion was born. The Vegan Collagen powder had already been in the works, but then Bacon learned that its ingredients could also be absorbed transdermally. That resulted the Plumping Jelly Serum, which I will definitely continue to use.Bacon is now working on two additions to her skincare line, and hopes to one day create a sunscreen. (\u201cI haven\u2019t found a facial sunscreen that I want to wear on my face every day,\u201d she explains.) As suspicious as I am, so far Beauty Shroom checks out\u2014and that\u2019s a feat when it comes to wellness. Or maybe I\u2019m just drinking the moon juice.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishTrendsRead MoreLifestyleAmanda Chantal Bacon's Wedding Cake Was Laced with Sex Dust ObviouslyBy Christine MuhlkeRecipes you want to make.
