Up next, Kiano Moju, the founder of culinary creative studio Jikoni Studios, takes us through a day of African house-fueled dance parties, office family meals, and midday strolls through Downtown L.A.\u201cMy North Star,\u201d says Kiano Moju, \u201cis to do my work with integrity and know what tastes good.\u201d The 30-year-old former BuzzFeed food producer founded Jikoni Studios in 2019 with this ethos in mind. As a multi-hyphenate who approaches the culinary world through many lenses, from recipe development to video production and photography, Moju decided to build a studio to house all her pursuits. At Jikoni\u2019s bright space in Downtown L.A., she and her team create and consult on branded food content, host events, develop recipes, and rent out their on-site kitchen studios for photo and video shoots.Despite the business finding its groove in early 2020, the studio was temporarily shuttered due to the pandemic and only just reopened in September. The ever effervescent Moju was undaunted. Along with her team, she channeled their drive into new virtual projects, like Jikoni\u2019s community recipe site, which sources dishes from a global community of gourmands and brings them to life through interviews and step-by-step videos.The venture spoke to one of Moju\u2019s central missions: celebrating traditionally underrepresented voices and cultures in food media. Growing up between Oakland and Kenya, she\u2019s often been met with blank eyes when talking about the cuisine of her heritage. \u201cI hate speaking about the food of Sub-Saharan Africa as a monolith, but that\u2019s how big the gap of culinary knowledge is about this region in other parts of the world,\u201d she explains. Throughout her career, Moju has fought to highlight marginalized food cultures, rejecting the all-too-common practice of relegating the limelight to holidays or heritage months.When I first connected with Kiano in June 2020, Jikoni\u2019s single kitchen space had gone dark. Ten months later, it\u2019s expanded to include four colorful, thronging studios and an ever expanding team. Perched at her desk in the airy test kitchen, Moju chatted about walking meetings, normalizing life at work, and her team\u2019s favorite lunch.Early mornings with French breakfast tea and eggsI sleep with my blinds open and have so much energy when I wake up, which is usually between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m. The morning, in my opinion, is the best time to eat, and I always make a hearty meal. My go-to is saut\u00e9ed spinach with a clove of garlic and some eggs scrambled in; toast on the side if I have it.Tea is my fancy indulgence. I have either matcha with a little honey or black tea with a splash of milk. The French Breakfast Tea from Mariage Fr\u00e8res is my favorite\u2014it comes in this black box with gold on the inside that glows back at you. Treating myself at the start of the day makes me feel like I\u2019m walking on clouds.Moju making green curry for her team.\nPhotograph by Jasmine DurhalMore dancing, fewer crunchesDepending on the day, I\u2019ll do 15 minutes of fitness\u2014I can\u2019t do more than that at home or I\u2019ll become incredibly uninterested. I got the Mirror recently because it doubles as decoration; I didn\u2019t like the idea of having a bulky fitness machine in my apartment. Instead, I might do a couple of dance videos on YouTube; my go-tos are by L.A.-based YouTuber The Fitness Marshall. They\u2019re easy to follow but always have a comedic tone to them. I gravitate toward classes that are fun, I don\u2019t like to feel tortured while working out.African house musicUnless I have to be at the studio early for a shoot, I\u2019ll get in around 10 a.m. The office is in our test kitchen and whoever arrives first knows to put the playlist on. We have morning dance breakouts and, for a Friday energy boost, I\u2019ll blast my Wakanda lineup, which features African house artists like Burna Boy and WizKd. My top track on the list is \u201cCome We Bill Ehh\u201d by Midas the Jagaban.Our supervising producer, Claire, will usually make a big pot of Kenyan chai and put it in a thermos so everyone can have some tea when they arrive. On Fridays, we have breakfast sandwiches.Soaking up the sun in Downtown L.A.\nPhotograph by Jasmine DurhalGraffiti strolls, walking meetings, and fridge foragingIf it\u2019s a shoot day, I\u2019m on my computer for 30 minutes and then we\u2019re in the studio making sure our clients are well taken care of. Otherwise, I\u2019m busy at my desk with interviews and business plans, interrupted by occasional trips to the test kitchen for a snack. We\u2019re in the Arts District in Downtown L.A., so I might walk around the block and try to get out somewhere\u2014maybe check out some graffiti in the neighborhood. Work takes up such a huge chunk of our days, I want to build everyday life into the workplace, rather than making it a place you have to break away from. I try to encourage my team to have walking meetings when computers aren\u2019t needed.Sometime before 2 p.m., we\u2019ll have a family meal, which is often Thai green curry. I\u2019ll forage in the fridge for test kitchen leftovers and add them to a base of curry paste, coconut milk, and fish sauce. I keep stacks of frozen parathas as well, so we\u2019ll have those too. If we\u2019re testing recipes, we\u2019ll always make a bit extra for lunches. If we do leave, we\u2019ll go nearby to Little Tokyo, where there are a lot of great places.(Virtual) office hoursClaire and I will do office hours on Clubhouse, where we say, \u201cAre you a food content creator that feels stuck on something? Talk to us and we\u2019ll try to workshop it with you.\u201d Those conversations are incredibly energizing because they are a tangible reminder of our mission and feel more like in-person interactions.The hard part about being an entrepreneur is not losing sight of why you started what you\u2019re doing, especially right now, when many businesses are struggling. Luckily, so much of what we do is grounded in the everyday\u2014everyday people, everyday problems. The motivations come frequently and they come from everywhere.Moju\u2019s skin-care lineup.\nPhotograph by Jasmine DurhalDinner popcorn, a mini-facial, and YouTube videosI don\u2019t care about dinner! I front-load my days with food, and by the time it\u2019s evening, I\u2019m just ready to go to bed. If I eat a proper breakfast and lunch, I\u2019ll have snacks for dinner\u2014a couple bites of something, like popcorn.After a long day I just want to stay in and take time with my skin-care routine. It\u2019s really joyous for me, like a mini daily facial. I love watching the transformation as I go through the steps and admiring the textures and packaging of the products. First, I wash my face with either this Av\u00e8ne cleanser or this makeup-removing one. My skin has been breaking out from masks, and since it\u2019s darker, I get hyperpigmentation. So I\u2019ll also get salicylic acid pads in the mix too. I use an exfoliating toner and then eye serum and hyaluronic serum from Typology followed by a face mist and Glossier moisturizer. At night I use a recovery night serum, and when it comes to masks, I\u2019ll go with Masque Vivant and Caudalie.While cleaning my skin, I usually brew my evening rooibos tea, and then I\u2019ll watch some YouTube videos while I sip. I gravitate toward channels that show how people around the world live. The topics can vary from the history and culture of different African regions, interviews, or home tours. Then, I drift off to bed early, feeling peaceful and prepared for tomorrow.Explore Bon App\u00e9titOffice CrushHealthyishInterviewsRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
