The recipe is flexible\u2014you can replace up to \u00bd cup (63 grams) all-purpose flour with whole wheat, use 2 Tbsp. flour instead of cornstarch, swap buttermilk for the sour cream, or use any neutral oil in place of the butter. Oh, and thanks to the reduced cider that\u2019s incorporated into the batter and soaked into the warm cake, it actually tastes just like a farmstand cider doughnut.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Lightly butter an 8\u00bdx4\u00bd\" or 9x5\" loaf pan. Line with parchment paper, leaving overhang on both long sides. Bring cider to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and simmer until cider is reduced to \u00be cup, 8\u201310 minutes. Pour \u00bc cup reduced cider into a small measuring glass or bowl and set aside. Transfer remaining reduced cider to a small bowl and let cool 5 minutes. Stir in sour cream and vanilla and set aside.Step 2Melt 8 Tbsp. butter in same saucepan (no need to clean) over low heat. Let cool slightly.\u00a0Step 3Whisk flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt, \u00bd tsp. cinnamon, and \u00bc tsp. nutmeg in a medium bowl to combine.Step 4Vigorously whisk eggs and \u00be cup (150 g) sugar in a large bowl until pale, voluminous, and frothy, about 2 minutes. Whisking constantly, gradually add melted butter in a steady stream; continue to whisk until fully combined and emulsified (no spots of fat should remain). Reserve saucepan.\u00a0Step 5Whisk dry ingredients into egg mixture in 3 additions, alternating with reserved sour cream mixture in 2 additions; whisk just until no lumps remain. Batter will be thin.\u00a0Step 6Scrape into pan and set on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake cake, rotating halfway through, until deep golden brown and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 60\u201380 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and poke top of cake all over with a toothpick. Spoon 3 Tbsp. reserved reduced cider over; let cool 10 minutes.Step 7Meanwhile, mix a big pinch of salt, remaining \u00bc cup (50 g) sugar, \u00bd tsp. cinnamon, and \u00bc tsp. nutmeg in a small bowl.

Sprinkle generously with sugar mixture to coat every surface (use parchment to help rotate cake and collect any excess sugar). Remove parchment and let cool completely before slicing.Do ahead: Cake can be made 4 days ahead.

That salt added to the glaze was delish. KimiyoLA1/10/2022I made this recipe exactly as specified and it was great. It was a huge hit with a family. No problems with it being dry or crumbly. We demolished it in two days. I\u2019m about to make another one right now. RudreshMontclair, NJ1/2/2022Followed recipe as is and it was very nice and fluffy! We ate half if it while it was warm. Will definitely make it again for people who like tang.Anonymous1/1/2022I did not have a loaf pan, so I used a 9x9 square. I increased the amount of cider to 2 cups and reduced it. I followed all other directions pretty carefully, and the cake came out FABULOUS.  No drooping or sagging, great crumb, and absolutely delicious. I\u2019d definitely make again. KSLAtlanta12/31/2021Why do you format your recipes so when I print them out they are 3 pages long?AnonymousNew York, NY12/29/2021I made this cake twice.  First try I followed the recipe to the letter.  Cake had good flavor but was on the \u2018dry and coarse\u2019 side.  Second try I followed the recipe but added homemade apple sauce to the batter just before placing in the loaf pan for baking.  WHAT a difference!  Flavor and consistency was great!! Applied thin layer of cream cheese frosting flavored with reserve apple cider.  Yum!Rachel BattlesShenandoah Valley12/29/2021In response to the review \"SEATTLE 12/5/2021\":\nThis is because Step 6 tells you to spoon 3 Tbsp. reserved reduced cider over. 3 +1 Tbsp = 1/4 cupAnonymous12/19/2021Great recipe, but there is an error. Step 1 tells you to reserve 1/4 reduced cider, but in step 7 it tells you to add melted butter to reserved 1 tablespoon of cider. AnonymousSeattle 12/5/2021Absolutely delicious. It is a little complicated but I just took my time and had all the ingredients for the different steps organized from the start. Took others' advice and started with 2 cups of apple cider. Made with GF flour plus 1/2tsp xanthan gum and yogurt instead of sour cream. Done in 60 mins. Only change next time would be to cut the cinnamon sugar by half.MeganCalifornia11/18/2021I followed the recipe exactly and the cake turned out delicious. I did not have trouble with the middle dipping like some reviewers stated, and I found the recipe easy to follow. I\u2019ll definitely make this one again!  AnonymousAustin, TX11/1/2021Made it GF with C4C flour.  Really whipped the eggs and sugar since I didn't have structure of gluten to rely on.  Still sank 3/4 way through baking.   But was delicious.  washcactusBainbridge Island WA10/26/2021I wanted to like this recipe so much . . . I am a fairly experienced home baker, and don't usually run into problems following recipes. Like a few other reviewers, the cake came out very heavy, and did not rise fully in the center although the tester came out clean. There was a trough in the center running the length of the loaf.  I did not love the texture and am wondering where I went wrong.AnonymousWestchester County, NYS10/17/2021Just ate a slice (and a half) warm from the oven and it\u2019s delicious. Moist crumb, perfectly spiced, and the sugar/cider caramelizes into a delicious crackly crust during baking. Only substitution I made was to use Greek yogurt in place of most of the sour cream. I encountered two issues - the cake did not release well due to aforementioned sugary crust and ended up cracking into a few pieces. This was my fault for not using the parchment sling (or maybe because I used a glass pan and did not lower temp). Second, the cake did not fully rise and had a dent in the top. This may be due to my flour measuring technique. I weighed the flour according to the measurements on the bag (King Arthur Flour) where 1 cup = 120g, rather than the Bon App\u00e9tit standard where 1 cup = 125g. I never know which one to use! Will try somewhere in the middle next time. While this cake was delicious and a worthwhile endeavor, it does not beat my og fave fall loaf, Molly Baz\u2019s pumpkin bread, which is less fussy, more healthy, and a touch tastier. AnnetteSeattle, WA10/14/2021Absolutely Delicious (albeit the instructions from a copy stand point could\u2019ve been a lot better). READ the instructions multiple times to ensure every step is super clear. I didn\u2019t take the mise en place approach and just baked step-by-step also; used less than 3/4 cups of sugar instead of the full cup and used 1 3/4 cup of apple cider. When dusting the loaf with the sugar mixture, I left the parchment on so that it catches any residual sugar. Do not forget to add the salt to the sugar mixture, really enhances the flavor profile of the loaf. I will most definitely be making this loaf again.
