Massaging the cabbage with salt not only seasons it, but also softens the leaves. Pistachios tossed with orange zest and sugar bring an unexpected floral note to the dish.

I just used a couple of pinches of the flake salt to massage into the cabbage. I did not use the thick white bottom part of the cabbage leaves. Kept the cabbage in the fridge for an hour and a half before serving. Loved the hint of orange through the salad with the toasted pistachios and thyme. I just threw a couple of handfuls parmesan. Served to a group and everyone enjoyed it. Will definitely serve again.NH DEBAmherst,NH7/1/2021I made half of the recipe for the 2 of us last night...outstanding recipe!  What I ended up doing was weighing out 7 oz. net weight of the cabbage, after hand tearing.  My choice was to not have any of the thick white centers of the Napa cabbage.  I did the salt massage, and then added the parsley and chives.  Did this a few hours in advance and kept chilled under dampened paper toweling.  As for the pistachios, I had roasted and salted at hand.  I simply chopped, and combined with the teeny bit of oil, and other components, leaving it covered at room temperature. As for the dressing, I also combined in advance and kept chilled. For serving, all was tossed together, and I ended up using 2 oz. of shaved Reggiano for the final toss. There was no sprinkling of anything over the salad....crazy easy to throw together and serve.  We LOVED it.Jeff WinettSherman Oaks, California6/25/2021It was tasty but don\u2019t think the Parmesan worked.  I\u2019d appreciate it I\u2019d bon appetit would provide the nutritional info for all their recipes. ncohen11Toronto4/11/2020Absolutely outstanding. Two suggestions: 1) definitely let the cabbage settle for a couple hours after the \"messaging\" to give time for the salt to soak into it rather than sit on the surface; 2) I used half the amount of salt called for and it was plenty. Maybe \"flakey\" sea salt is the key but I used normal sea salt grated coarsely. Remember people can always add more salt so err on the side of less. AnonymousChicago3/16/2020This salad was terrific; I did cut the salt and it was still a little salty.  The orange zest was refreshing. A win for the guys in my family who don\u2019t care much for salad. ThanksDonna EPa1/6/2020Good salad, but I found it way too salty. I would cut back on the amount of salt used to soften the cabbage.
