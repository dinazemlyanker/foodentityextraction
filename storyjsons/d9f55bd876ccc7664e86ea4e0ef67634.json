While they may be intimidating to work with (it\u2019s never pleasant when your food veers into soapy territory), they\u2019re incredibly versatile and, if handled with care, easy to incorporate into your baking and cooking. With a slight hand and a few tips and tricks, you can keep your dishes fragrant, floral, and not perfumey.What are floral extracts?Commonly used in South Asian and Middle Eastern cooking\u2014though you\u2019ll find them in cuisines across the world\u2014floral extracts (most commonly, orange blossom water and rose water) are made from boiling flower petals and distilling the steam into a concentrated essence. It\u2019s potent, heady stuff; there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s also commonly used in perfumes.Orange blossom water does have a mild citrusy scent, but it\u2019s less punchy and direct than orange zest or juice. Made from the flower petals rather than the fruit itself, you\u2019ll get sweet notes of jasmine, a mild bitterness, and an overall more herbaceous aroma. Rose water smells like, well, a bouquet of roses. Rich, sweet, and familiar, a little goes a long way.Cortas Orange Blossom Water$8 at AmazonThe Spice House Orange Blossom Water$11 at The Spice HouseHow do you use floral extracts?This is the fun part: Floral extracts taste delicious in a wide range of applications, so experimenting with them is a low-risk way to add a little extra something to your cooking when you\u2019re trying to impress.\u201cIt\u2019s more luxe than anything else,\u201d says associate food editor Zaynab Issa. \u201cYou can add a little bit and it feels special.\u201d Her favorite way to use floral extracts is in sweet, bright, fruity treats\u2014she\u2019ll add a few drops to a frozen watermelon granita in the summertime.Add it to homemade jam, fold it into whipped cream to serve with fresh fruit, or mix it into a simple buttercream for the next cake you bake. Blend it into a refreshing agua fresca, add a drop or two to a cocktail, or incorporate it into cookies, crisps, pies, or pastries. All are good candidates for some floral fun.Strawberries are a natural companion to rose water in this agua fresca.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca JurkevichFor savory applications, orange blossom water and rose water play nicely with light, bright, herby, and citrusy accompaniments. Add a couple drops to a pot of steamed rice, lemony dips and sauces, citrusy salad, or to the marinade for a roasted fish, like this Black Bass with Orange Flower Water.Unlike adding fresh herbs or other aromatics that can turn bitter or lose their flavor after cooking, floral extracts aren\u2019t quite as heat-sensitive, so they\u2019ll hold up no matter what stage or step of cooking you add them in.Issa\u2019s number one piece of advice: Go slow. Start with a drop before adding more, and when possible, dilute it before incorporating it directly into your cooking. Instead of shaking a bottle of rose water over your sweet treats\u2014an easy way to accidentally overdo it\u2014first mix it into a \u201csolvent,\u201d as Issa describes it. For example, add rose water to a simple syrup to soak your jalebi, or use it to dissolve other spices, like saffron in this Pistachio Almond Brittle. While other flavorings such as vanilla extract or rum can take a more mellow backseat even if you add an extra splash or two, floral extracts will be the first thing you smell when you take a bite.\u201cThere\u2019s a fine line between nice accessory and overpowering showman,\u201d says Issa. Better to start with a little and work your way up by taste and personal preference.Where can I buy floral extracts?Look for rose water and orange blossom water in tall, glass bottles at Middle Eastern and South Asian grocery stores\u2014though your supermarket may also stock a few varieties in their spice section or international aisle. They\u2019re also easy to track down online\u2014just make sure you\u2019re purchasing floral extracts specifically made for culinary and not cosmetic purposes. We\u2019re fans of brands like Stories + Objects that make limited batches of artisanal rose water from Iran and are worth the splurge, but if you\u2019re on the hunt for a relatively inexpensive alternative, brands like Al Wadi and Cortas are reliable and worth seeking out.Al Wadi Rose Water$14 at Amazon$7 at Snuk FoodsThe Spice House Rose Water$11 at The Spice HouseGet the recipeJalebiIt only takes a handful of ingredients to bring this dazzling South Asian snack to life in your kitchen.
