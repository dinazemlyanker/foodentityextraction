We got you. Welcome to Happy Hour with Al, a monthly column where Al Culliton, Basically's resident bartender, sets you up to get the most bang for your booze with the fewest possible bottles.Okay, let\u2019s say you\u2019ve been invited to a party. The host says to \u201cbring something to drink.\u201d That\u2019s pretty broad isn\u2019t it? You\u2019re probably going to default to wine. It\u2019s easy, and who doesn\u2019t love wine? But I\u2019ve got a better idea, and it\u2019s sure to make you the Party Hero you\u2019ve always known you could be. You\u2019re going to bring a bottle full of cocktails.The benefits of such a thing are many: You can do it ahead of time, you don\u2019t have to stir or shake anything to order\u2014you just pour the cocktail from a bottle\u2014and you don\u2019t have to go overboard and bring a whole bar set up with you.Any stirred drink can easily be turned into a bottle of cocktails\u2014think Manhattans, martinis, and the like. But I\u2019d like to draw your attention to a drink so elemental, so downright American that you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to come across someone who will refuse it. That drink, my friends, is the old-fashioned.The old-fashioned was originally known as the Whiskey Cocktail because, well, at one point it was actually new-fashioned. It didn\u2019t get its new old-fashioned name until the late 19th century, when it underwent a resurgence in popularity.The old-fashioned is an archetypal cocktail, and actually follows to the letter what is purported to be the first published definition of cocktail from 1806: just booze, sugar, bitters, and water. Typically it\u2019s comprised of either rye whiskey or bourbon with a sugar cube or simple syrup, bitters, and ice.There she is, folks: the old-fashioned, in all her glory.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigBefore we mix up this big batch of boozy goodness (eight servings, to be precise), we\u2019ve got to make our simple syrup. For this application, I find that a richer-than-normal simple syrup is ideal due to its higher viscosity. That means it\u2019s a two-to-one ratio of sugar to water instead of the usual one-to-one. Boil \u00bc cup of water and add \u00bd cup sugar to it. Stir vigorously until sugar is completely dissolved. Set aside and let cool.Make sure you have all of your ingredients nearby: That\u2019s a bottle of rye whiskey (Old Overholt is a great budget option), the rich simple syrup you just made, and bitters (Angostura, which you can find in most grocery stories, is classic here). Grab a liter bottle. The best kind are bottles that have flip-tops\u2014they have myriad uses and you\u2019ll never lose the cap\u2014but any leftover bottle kicking it in your recycling bin (and washed!) that has a screw cap will work in a pinch. Using a funnel, pour in: 3\u00bd cups of whiskey, \u00bd cup of water, 1\u00bd ounces of syrup, and a whole \u00bd ounce of bitters. Prying the built-in dasher thing off the bitters bottle will make this easier. (If adding water to your cocktail seems weird, it isn\u2019t! Dilution is exactly what we\u2019re doing when we stir a cocktail. We\u2019re not stirring these, so we\u2019re going to add the water that would have been imparted by stirring with melting ice. Cool, huh?) Close the bottle and gently rock the contents back and forth a few times to combine. Add more syrup, water, and/or bitters to taste, but be sure to do so in very small amounts\u2014the balance here is deceptively delicate. Chill in the fridge, or freezer if you\u2019re hurting for time. You\u2019re now the proud creator of not one but eight cocktails!All bottled up with places to go.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigWhile your old-fashioneds get frosty, reflect on just how easy that was. Now that you know how to batch a stirred cocktail, you can do the same thing with Manhattans, Negronis, martinis, and all their many variations and relatives. Simply multiply your cocktail recipe by eight and add \u00bd cup of water to dilute. If the drink contains bitters, start small and scale up. Adjust sweetness and add water to taste.Now go about gathering some accoutrements like citrus or brandied cherries; bring what you need to finish your garnish, too, like a vegetable peeler for making citrus twists or some toothpicks. You\u2019re ready! Grab your now-cold bottle, throw everything into a tote, and be on your way. (You\u2019re going to want to get a bag of ice en route because there\u2019s a good chance your host doesn\u2019t have enough of it. Just saying.)The old-fashioned setup.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigAll right, you're at the party, poised for greatness. To serve your old-fashioned, fill a rocks glass with ice, pour in about 3\u00bd ounces from the bottle (it\u2019s okay to eyeball at this point, because the ratio will be perfect regardless), and garnish with whatever you brought: orange slices, brandied cherries, and/or lemon or grapefruit peels. So festive!Pour an old-fashioned for yourself and one for your host. And then just let it happen. Prepare some gracious replies for all the compliments you\u2019re going to get.
