This spirit\u2019s depth and complexity make it the ideal base for a warming winter cocktail, as in this fruity, peppery punch swizzle from cocktail expert Shyretha Sheats. Where a traditional punch recipe might call for orgeat (almond syrup), Sheats substitutes a creamy condensed milk and pineapple syrup for a tropical vibe. The syrup\u2019s yield is party-size (about 2 cups): Scale up the rest of the ingredients for 12 servings, then batch the drink into a punch bowl, or make just a couple of servings and save the extra syrup for drizzling over ice cream or pound cake. Sheats loves Pierre Ferrand cognac, particularly the Ambr\u00e9 or the 1840 Original Formula, for its quality and price point.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Not, please, NOT a Martel Cordon Bleu or equivalent. A VS, or, if you must, a VSOP will do just fine. Wasting an aged brandy on punch is, or certainly should be, criminal.Leon JesterSouth Central Virginia12/9/2021To be fair, I have no idea what the resulting drink \"should\" taste like.  That being said, I thought it was pretty tasty, though not wholly to my liking.  For the pineapple syrup, I found the herbs and Sweetened condensed milk overpowered any pineapple flavor.  Next time I'd increase the pineapple, or decrease the sweetened condensed milk.  I may have added too much herb as well (one \"sprig\" for sage is a little subjective... my sage was healthy and had very large leaves) so I'd scale it back next time, and maybe add some warmer spices like nutmeg... maybe slightly crush the peppercorn.  \n\nMade two cocktails - the first to the recipe, and the second omitting the Absinthe and adjusting the ratios so it was less acidic.  I much prefer it sans absinthe, but again, that's just my flavor preference.
