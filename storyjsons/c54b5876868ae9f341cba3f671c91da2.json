Here\u2019s how to manage your media diet right now.By The Healthyish TeamJune 1, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Shan\u00e9e Benjamin \u00a0FacebookTwitterEmailIn the last few weeks alone, we\u2019ve seen footage of two white men killing Ahmaud Arbery, a police officer kneeling on George Floyd\u2019s neck, law enforcement tear-gassing, pepper-spraying, and physically assaulting protestors, and cars and storefronts burning in cities from Denver to D.C. It feels impossible to look away and imperative to witness, but damn if it doesn\u2019t take a toll.This is especially true for Black people, for reasons that are all too clear. \u201cHearing and seeing images of your people being brutalized messes with your mind and brings up feelings of fear and hopelessness,\u201d says Camesha L. Jones LCSW. Unchecked, those feelings can lead to anxiety and depression as well as physical symptoms like headaches, shaking, trembling, racing thoughts, and sleep issues.Jones is a licensed therapist and the founder of Sista Afya, a Chicago-based organization supporting mental wellness for women of the African Diaspora. Recently, Sista Afya led a virtual support group to talk about how to confront the inundation of negative news\u2014from COVID-19 to racial violence\u2014and how to step away.After the support group, we reached out to Jones and asked her to share some of her strategies for dealing with news-induced anxiety right now.1. DisengageFor some people, turning their phone off for one full day a week is a great way to detox from news overload. For others, setting daily boundaries is more effective. Jones recommends making a schedule. For example, check the news (including social media!) only three times a day and at certain times. And set a limit on the amount of time you\u2019ll spend on these platforms each day, like one hour max.2. DistractPay attention to your body while you\u2019re consuming news and social media. If you\u2019re starting to feel symptoms of anxiety like tension in your shoulders or tightness in your throat, it\u2019s time to turn off the screen and temporarily redirect your attention. That could mean taking your dog for a walk or doing a simple chore or making a cup of tea. Jones emphasizes that this strategy is for the immediate short-term. \u201cDistractions shouldn\u2019t go on for days on end. The goal is to take your attention away from the news so you can begin to regulate your body and your emotions.\u201d3. Self-SootheOnce you\u2019ve distracted yourself successfully, do something that gives you a sense of calmness, joy, or peace. Jones suggests listening to music, reciting affirmations, or doing body awareness exercises. This is an important follow-up to distraction, says Jones, because it allows your body and mind to fully restore.4. Get Support Off-ScreenIt\u2019s easy to use social media to stay connected, and, when we\u2019re stuck at home, it\u2019s often necessary. But, as we all know, it\u2019s also easy to get trapped in the endless, anxious scroll. So be intentional when you go to tap that Twitter or Instagram app. Are you looking for information or connection? If the latter, could you get it in a different way? Could you text instead or even make a *gasp* phone call? If it\u2019s safe to do so in your area, could you meet up IRL? \u201cA friend called me the other day to ask how I was holding up, and that meant more to me than people posting comments on my Instagram account,\u201d Jones says. \u201cGoing old-school can go a long way.\u201d5. Follow Up With HopeLastly, says Jones, \u201cconsume the minimum amount of news you need to feel informed, then follow it up immediately with something that gives you hope.\u201d That could be a small goal to accomplish that day, a plan with a friend, or a daydream about what a better future might be. \u201cWe\u2019re not getting messages of hope or help from the news,\u201d says Jones, so we have to take it upon ourselves to believe that things can change.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSelf CareInterviewsRead MoreLifestyle7 Virtual Mental Health Resources Supporting Black People Right NowBy Jesse SparksRecipes you want to make.
