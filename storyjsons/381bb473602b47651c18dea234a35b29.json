A latex-gloved hand eases open the heavy double doors and I\u2019m ushered into the dim and spacious lobby, whisked past one of a half-dozen sanitization stations, and led along a short walkway that flanks the upper dining room. I follow the arrows taped on the ground that enforce one-way traffic flow and pass another sanitization station, this one manned by two staffers dedicated to continuously wiping down high-traffic touch points.A wall of windows looks out over the biggest draw at Ray\u2019s on the River: the restaurant\u2019s park-like main patio. (There are two, but this one has the choice view of Atlanta\u2019s lazy Chattahoochee River.) I keep moving into a detached pavilion with abundant overflow seating\u2014open to diners most of this season now that the wedding receptions are on pause\u2014then pass through a private dining room, repurposed to hold as many properly distanced tables as you might find in a more reasonably sized restaurant. Behind the scenes, masked prep cooks make somewhat feeble attempts at kitchen banter while plunging immersion blenders into vats of potatoes. The whole thing is a little bit Goodfellas, a little bit Contagion.Ray Schoenbaum posts up in a cushy circular booth with a view of all three levels of his restaurant. The grizzled second-generation restaurateur\u2014whose various operations have survived such setbacks as the 1979 gas crisis, 9/11, the Great Recession, and the peculiarly Atlantan meltdown that ensues after a dusting of snow\u2014takes a call from his lawyer, who asks how business is going on this day in early May. \u201cWell, we\u2019re doing about 15, 20 percent of what we were doing,\u201d Schoenbaum says, \u201cbut it\u2019s going to take time.\u201dHostess Nadia Turner takes a customer\u2019s temperature at the entrance to Ray\u2019s On The River.\nPhoto By DUSTIN CHAMBERSFour days earlier, on May 1, Ray\u2019s was among the first restaurants to resume dine-in service in the first state to reopen after a weeks-long COVID-19 lockdown. Schoenbaum says reopening felt ballsy, despite the abundance of precautions he and his team have taken. At Ray\u2019s, the silverware is heated to 195 degrees (a temperature said to kill the coronavirus) before it hits the table; the new AC filtration system employs UV rays to annihilate pathogens; and the surplus of servers and staff sanitizers on the floor, all receiving hazard pay, are at militaristic attention.\u201cI\u2019ve been in the business a long time, been through a lot of situations,\u201d Schoenbaum says, fiddling with the edges of a cocktail napkin. \u201cYou live on the edge a little bit. I feel like this country wasn\u2019t built on being afraid. I mean, if we want to be a great country, we have to take some chances.\u201dIn the days after Governor Brian Kemp announced he would restart Georgia\u2019s economy, Schoenbaum joined an email chain with about 70 other local restaurateurs who were struggling with whether to reopen. At the time he found himself to be something of an outlier. \u201cI didn't completely agree with the fact that almost all of them, especially in the city, didn\u2019t want to open yet,\u201d Schoenbaum says. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a little bit of an economic decision, but it\u2019s also a little political.\u201dServer Mercury Jackson walks past a couple on a date in the dining room.\nPHOTO BY DUSTIN CHAMBERSThat first night, Ray\u2019s turned just 125 tables\u2014a little more than a third of a pre-pandemic Friday. But maybe that\u2019s not so bad for the first weekend following six weeks during which nary a single dining room in Georgia (and most states beyond) sat a single diner. Or, depending on whom you ask, maybe that\u2019s not so good. It\u2019s particularly hard to tell in Georgia whether the virus is anywhere close to under control given the state\u2019s epic COVID-19 case-tracking screwups. That the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is headquartered here offers little consolation and ample irony; on April 28, the day after Georgia restaurants were allowed to welcome back diners, CNN\u2019s Sanjay Gupta asked Emory University infectious disease expert Carlos del Rio, M.D., if Georgia was ready to reopen. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, but\u2026from a health standpoint, it\u2019s always too soon. From a business standpoint, it's always too late,\u201d del Rio replied. \u201cI'm not going to restaurants and I'm continuing practicing social distancing, and I'm continuing doing it because I care for my health.\u201dThere are two common endings to pandemics according to historians: the \u201cmedical,\u201d in which the sickness somehow or other subsides, and the \u201csocial,\u201d in which humanity slowly, collectively begins to simply move on. The latter ending feels distinctly American, especially now\u2014though not altogether reassuring.But the social ending might be the only one that will save a certain type of restaurant: chef-driven, innovative, intimate. If those places stay closed for too long\u2014if only the big deep-pocketed guys are willing to reopen\u2014that has the potential to reshape not just Atlanta\u2019s but any city\u2019s dining scene, in devastating and homogenizing ways.\u201cThere\u2019s a moral thing, there's a science thing, and then there\u2019s an actual financial thing.\u201dOn April 28, 64 chefs and restaurateurs took a vow\u2014in the form of a full-page ad in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution\u2014not to reopen their dining rooms. The collective, dubbed #GAHospitalityTogether,\u201d is a who\u2019s who of the state\u2019s most innovative culinary superstars, including James Beard winners Mashama Bailey of The Grey, Hugh Acheson of Five & Ten and Empire State South, Steven Satterfield of Miller Union, and Anne Quatrano of Bacchanalia, Star Provisions, W.H. Stiles Fish Camp, and Floataway Cafe.Pietro Gianni, partner and general manager of Storico Fresco in Buckhead and its newer sister joint Forza Storico on Atlanta\u2019s Westside, is among the five or so restaurateurs helping to lead the #GAHospitalityTogether collective. The movement began as a way to take a stand against reopening too soon, but it also has functioned as a network of shared resources. It\u2019s a way for restaurateurs to help one another navigate the complexities of federal aid for them and their employees and to interpret and improve upon the recommended safety precautions against the coronavirus.8Arm sous chef Duy Huynh bundles vegetables from local farms for a CSA program the restaurant is running in lieu of regular food and drink service.\nPhoto by DUSTIN CHAMBERSGianni and his partners went back and forth for weeks on what to do with their two restaurants. \u201cThere\u2019s a moral thing, there's a science thing, and then there\u2019s an actual financial thing,\u201d he told me when we first spoke in early May.Gianni grew up in Rome and his family is still there, so he got a bit of a head start in weighing the moral thing\u2014while his family is healthy and safe, they\u2019ve accepted social distancing as a way of life to protect their larger community. Also, his girlfriend is an anesthetist who intubates patients, which is to say his intake of terrifying COVID info is high. Scientifically speaking, he was uncomfortable with the sheer amount of time guests hang out in a restaurant (sitting for hours in an enclosed place where you\u2019re in proximity to others and touching multiple surfaces can help the coronavirus spread) and with the fact that restaurateurs can\u2019t easily control the behavior of their guests. \u201cYou start having stays of an hour and a half, two hours or longer, because these days people have been home for so long they\u2019re excited to be out,\u201d he said. \u201cThen there's the alcohol, which is freaky. You drink. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. You become a danger.\u201dAnd financially, Georgia\u2019s reopening guidelines are pretty thorny too. While the original rule  stating that restaurants could seat 10 customers per 500 feet of public space was adjusted on May 12 to allow 10 customers per 300 feet, that\u2019s still well under 50 percent capacity for all but the largest restaurants. \u201cOur restaurants are not made for those guidelines,\u201d Gianni told me. \u201cWe only make money if we\u2019re packed out. I\u2019m not going to reopen to break even and put people in danger and make them make less money than they\u2019re making with their unemployment. It\u2019s just a dog that chases its own tail.\u201dFor diners like Shannon Green, the sooner Gianni and others could figure out these issues, the better. The interior designer says she was miserable while holed up for weeks in her high-rise waiting for the restaurants she most loves, including Storico Fresco, to reopen. \u201cAll my friends in California and all over, they\u2019re firing away text messages to me, asking what it\u2019s like,\u201d Green says. \u201cAnd at first I was like, \u2018It\u2019s the same. No one is opening. Doesn\u2019t matter what the governor said, no one is doing anything about it.\u2019\u201dBy Friday, May 1, a neighborhood grill near Green\u2019s apartment was open for dine-in and she met a friend there for margaritas, burgers, and fries. \u201cAll the staff and everyone was wearing masks,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t wearing a mask because it was the first time I got dressed up. I was not going to ruin my outfit. And you\u2019re eating, so what\u2019s the point?\u201dServer Jessica Justice carrying a glass of white wine in the bar area at Ray\u2019s On The River.\nPhoto by DUSTIN CHAMBERSGreen points to the fact that she\u2019s young\u201433\u2014and lives alone as reasons she can more safely dine in restaurants. \u201cAnd I have an immune system where I can\u2019t even remember the last time I was sick,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, maybe I\u2019ll get a sinus infection for a day. I\u2019m also pretty hardheaded and I think that that makes me more immune too. So I\u2019m not worried at all about contracting COVID. And if I do, okay, in two weeks I\u2019ll be fine.\u201dThough Green\u2019s isn\u2019t exactly representative of the average Atlanta diner (many are taking a more cautious approach), she\u2019s also not alone in her rush to return to restaurants. At Escobar, a glamorous and lounge-y spot from restaurateur Mychel \u201cSnoop\u201d Dillard and the rapper 2 Chainz, the rush of diners was so intense after the dining room reopened at reduced capacity on May 4 that the staff had to turn people away from the door. (A few weeks later, the restaurant was temporarily shut down by the Georgia Department of Public Safety after officers determined its crowds were in violation of state social distancing guidelines.)One of Dillard\u2019s biggest motivations for reopening Escobar was to get her staff back to work, since not all of them were able to qualify for unemployment. She also points out that her Paycheck Protection Program small-business loan requires that she hire back the majority of her staff by the end of June. That condition has been a major challenge for restaurants nationwide; Congress is currently trying to change the rule so that businesses receiving PPP loans aren\u2019t forced to rush people back to work before businesses have the need for them.Dillard says she\u2019s grateful to be able to bring employees back. \u201cI know that the governor has been getting a lot of backlash, but I'm actually happy that he at least has given us the option to operate our business,\u201d she says. \u201cNot every citizen has to come out if they don't feel comfortable enough, but I think it just helps get the economy back, and it gives business owners the option to stay in business.\u201dThere\u2019s no place Monica feels less safe than behind the counter at the mobbed fast-casual restaurant where she works in midtown Atlanta. (We\u2019re withholding her last name because she fears reprisal for speaking up about her working conditions.) She tried her best not to be there. Though she\u2019s young, in her 20s, her asthma puts her at a higher risk for COVID-19.\"It\u2019s like I'm staring death in the eye for $10 an hour.\u201dMonica gave her boss a doctor\u2019s note back in March and stayed home for several weeks. She waited for a stimulus check that never arrived (despite the fact that she filed her 2018 and 2019 taxes on time and makes way less than the $75,000 cutoff) and for unemployment benefits that as of mid-May hadn\u2019t materialized (she says her unemployment claim had been approved, but the money failed to show up week after week).After blowing through her savings and getting a request from her boss to come back to work, she says she had no choice but to return the week of May 11. She was appalled by the behavior of the customers and by the fact that it was so stiflingly hot in the restaurant\u2019s space that she often had to pull down her mask to breathe. \u201cIf we were in a more sensible society, I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about this,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s like I'm staring death in the eye for $10 an hour.\u201dMonica encountered hundreds of people on each of her shifts, most of them on their way to or from Atlanta\u2019s massive (and often overcrowded) Piedmont Park. She says many of them were drinking or downright drunk and quick to ignore the restaurant\u2019s rules about minimizing congregation on the patio. \u201cI\u2019m almost resigned to the fact that I\u2019ll catch it,\u201d she told me in her second week back. \u201cI\u2019m hoping it won\u2019t kill me.\u201dShe\u2019s spent a lot of time thinking about the psychological divide between customers \u201cwho are having a fun time getting their food\u201d and workers like herself. \u201cThey should really know that on the other side of their transaction there\u2019s a human being who\u2019s really scared,\u201d Monica says. \u201cAt least tip a lot, at least keep a mask on, at least don\u2019t make the jokes that I have to fake laugh at about you not caring about coronavirus.\u201dGeorgia state Rep. Bee Nguyen, who was elected three years ago to the seat vacated by Stacey Abrams, says one of her main concerns with reopening restaurants is \u201chow this is going to affect workers who may not feel safe going back into work and then will no longer qualify for unemployment.\u201dSous chef Thomas Hubbard walks past a worker putting together a takeout order in the kitchen at Ray\u2019s On The River.\nDustin ChambersNguyen says she\u2019s been on plenty of calls with the state Department of Labor, \u201cand it's been really challenging to get an answer.\u201d All she\u2019s been able to determine is that if a worker has contracted COVID-19 or lives with and/or cares for a family member who has, that worker is still eligible for unemployment under the federal government\u2019s evolving coronavirus provisions. So is anyone who has an underlying health condition that puts them at risk, is unable to get to work due to the pandemic (as in the event of a canceled bus route), or has a child at home who\u2019s unable to go back to school.But what about workers who don\u2019t fall into any of the above categories? \u201cI think [the labor department] has been very careful to not give an affirmative answer on that,\u201d Nguyen says. \u201cAnd, quite honestly, there are things that the governor could have done that would have ensured better safety for workers.\u201dShe believes the state should have mandated that any business wanting to reopen require its employees to be regularly tested for COVID, at the state\u2019s expense. \u201cI would actually recommend that restaurant owners and employees go ahead and get tested now and try to get tested repeatedly because we know you can contract it at any time. The testing is free. You call the state partnership hotline and they\u2019ll direct you to testing centers in your county.\u201dAs of late May, Monica hadn\u2019t taken a coronavirus test\u2014but she did have some good news. \u201cGot unemployment!\u201d she DM\u2019d me on Memorial Day. \u201cI worked my last shift yesterday.\u201dChef Maricela Vega helms 8Arm, a restaurant where equity and social justice are as much a part of the menu as the locally foraged mushrooms and masa crafted in-house from heritage corn. Under normal circumstances, 8Arm\u2019s dining room, patio, and adjacent natural wine bar seat 125 people. By Vega\u2019s estimate, Georgia\u2019s guidelines would allow between 25 and 40. \u201cI\u2019m potentially looking at somehow opening up for those 25 people to sit down,\u201d she told me in mid-May. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want anybody hanging out around here right now.\u201d8Arm isn\u2019t currently offering takeout either. Vega\u2019s initial and short-lived take-out menu (which, it should be mentioned, was among the very best in the city) brought in a fifth of the revenue she saw on her slowest pre-pandemic nights. \u201cWe had convinced ourselves that it would be easy,\u201d she says. \u201cWe really did try\u2014and it was just so exhausting. It\u2019s embarrassing, but some days we weren\u2019t even making $500.\u201dInstead, Vega pivoted by launching a riff on a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program (it was already in the works, but she rolled it out early). The program is of modest benefit to 8Arm\u2014the restaurant makes money only when buyers add extras such as Vega\u2019s fragrant lentil-and-pickled-ramp tamales and her fermented-pumpkin hot sauce to their produce bags. \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t added the add-ons,\u201d she says, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t even be making enough to make rent and cover the bills.\u201dMaricela Vega stands among CSA bags being prepared for customer pickup in the dining room of 8Arm.\nPhoto By DUSTIN CHAMBERSThe CSA program does much more to benefit the local farmers who had relied on 8Arm to buy their micro-crops of heirloom curly kale, pinky-finger-size carrots, and tender cutleaf coneflower greens. Through the CSA, Vega has created more demand for their produce than even her restaurant had warranted. \u201cI had at least three farmers say, \u2018You helped us make payrolls and secure jobs we were about to furlough,\u201d she reports.Still, sales of the CSA packages dipped a little when she increased the price, tacking on $15 so that she could provide packages free of charge to undocumented workers who\u2019ve lost their jobs; those workers have been hit disproportionately hard by the pandemic, qualifying for neither stimulus checks nor unemployment. \u201cThe restaurant industry has relied for ages on the equity and work of undocumented people,\u201d Vega says. \u201cFor them to not have any sort of help in a concerted way\u2014I mean, it\u2019s crazy.\u201dAnd as for the restaurant itself? \u201cI think we just have to be patient,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no real answer that I\u2019ve been able to figure out. What is the plan that we should be going with? To be truthful, the plan changes almost every week.\u201d (Editor\u2019s note: At press time, 8Arm had just announced a new patio-only concept launching on June 4, with private dining in the adjacent wine bar to follow.)On May 28, del Rio, the Emory infectious disease expert, held a press conference to offer his thoughts on a recent spike in COVID-19 cases in Georgia. The state Department of Health had chalked up the 26 percent week-over-week rise to the fact that more widespread testing had become available in the state. But there was plenty of speculation that the reopened economy was to blame. \u201cIt\u2019s not either-or,\u201d del Rio said. \u201cI think it\u2019s probably both.\u201dThe press conference came exactly a month after #GAHospitalityTogether placed that ad in the newspaper\u2014and since mid May at least 20 of the chefs and restaurateurs who\u2019d vowed to keep their dining rooms closed have reopened them.Two weeks after I first spoke with him, Gianni and his partners reopened their Westside restaurant for dine-in customers on May 20. The following week they reopened their Buckhead location. The first night of service on the Westside included an expanded and socially distanced patio, the ability to order by smartphone and request minimal contact with staff, and a jersey-clad referee who patrolled the area to ensure diners played by the rules. The next day I asked Gianni what swayed him. \u201cThe decision was, I kinda want to and I kinda have to,\u201d he said. His restaurants had survived the first two months of the pandemic by selling take-out food to the public and preparing meals\u2014paid by charitable organizations and the business sector\u2014for frontline medical workers. But then, the weekend before Forza Storico reopened, the donations dried up.\u201cI was fearful,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve seen how well we were able to make an awkward situation fun and cool.\u201dDiners at a table in the dining room at Ray\u2019s On The River\nDUSTIN CHAMBERSThe day after Forza Storico reopened, Anne Quatrano\u2014Atlanta\u2019s grande dame of down-to-earth fine dining and another member of #GAHospitalityTogether\u2014was preparing to reopen Bacchanalia and Floataway that very night. \u201cToday I am more anxious than I\u2019ve been for any of our real restaurant openings,\u201d she told me. She\u2019s had 12 of those.Quatrano says there was no coordinated reopening effort between her and other chefs in the collective. The main thing for her was that the vast majority of her staff said they were ready to come back to work, so she brought back whoever wanted to return.In Bacchanalia\u2019s brave new world of fine dining, all four courses now arrive on the table covered by domes, and the amuse bouche and mignardises are presented in little boxes. Cocktails are prebatched and bottled; diners pour them themselves. Gone are the multiple table settings (that\u2019s way too many touches); instead, all the cutlery for the meal will be on the table from the very beginning, in a single bespoke package. Quatrano even ditched her legendary cheese cart (the potential for cross-contamination is too risky), but there will still be a cheese course.\u201cWe had eight weeks to figure it out,\u201d Quatrano tells me. Waiting any longer, she says, could have forced her into an early retirement\u2014and after running Bacchanalia for 27 years, she\u2019s not ready to accept that ending. \u201cRestaurants, we change all the time. We have to. We need to be prepared to serve people however they want to be served, however they feel comfortable and safe, and that\u2019s our job. It\u2019s changing, but I think we\u2019re going to handle it.\u201dOn May 29, the day this story was set to go to press, major protests broke out in Atlanta over the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. The ongoing unrest and resulting daily curfews added yet another layer of uncertainty to the lives of restaurant owners trying to simultaneously navigate the threat of COVID-19 and the confusion of a reopened economy.The issue is particularly thorny for Black business owners located in the areas where protests are most prominent, as Derrick Hayes of Big Dave\u2019s Cheesesteaks can attest. Hayes got his start cooking cheesesteaks in a space attached to a Shell gas station, where he worked a single fryer and a three-foot grill. Over the past six years, he built up his customer base and its Instagram following (214,000 and counting)\u2014until finally, last summer, he was able to move his operation across town, into bigger and nicer digs in downtown Atlanta.Even after the virus forced him to close his dining room in March, Hayes maintained his breakneck pace with takeout orders\u2014including an afternoon of free chicken cheesesteak egg rolls for 1,000 curbside customers who followed social-distancing rules and a month of meals for frontline workers, paid for in part with money raised by Chicago rapper Lil Durk.\u201cThe community knows how I stand for them,\u201d Hayes says. That made it all the more difficult when, as he was contemplating when and how to safely reopen his dining room, Big Dave\u2019s storefront windows were smashed on the first night of Atlanta\u2019s protests. \u201cI was hurt, because I worked my tail off to get that location open,\u201d he says. \u201cBut at the same time, I understand. We're angry. We're tired of going through this. We want to be treated equally.\u201dThe broken windows will keep Big Dave\u2019s out of commission at least until next week; Hayes is waiting on the special glass that has to be specially made for the historic building that houses his restaurant. But the community has stepped in to help: As of June 3, repairs have been fully covered by online fundraisers and a large donation from another rapper, Russ. Big Dave\u2019s will reopen\u2014still just for takeout\u2014as soon as the glass sets, and is now using any further donations from their GoFundMe to help support other local small businesses owned by people of color.\u201cWe're all in this together,\u201d says Hayes. \u201cLet's show that we\u2019re all in this together.\u201dMara Shalhoup is deputy editor at Atlanta magazine.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsGeorgiaAtlantaCoronavirusRecipes you want to make.
