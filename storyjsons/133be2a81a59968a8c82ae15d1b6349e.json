I have a bumper crop of fennel in my garden so have been cooking fennel in many ways-in Italian, sauce, savory galettes, slaw. This stuff is great. I worried it would either be slimy or too hard. Great texture--even better flavor. AnonymousVermont7/8/2020Delicious! Very simple to make with a great flavour. Will be making again!AnonymousToronto, ON5/23/2020This was wicked good. My family loves fennel so we're always trying to do new things with it. I will say, the gochujang is spicy but tasty. Would def make it again and would love to try with other crunchy veggies!AnonymousWesterly, RI6/23/2019Delicious recipe, easy and quick to make.  It was my first time ever cooking fennel as we usually have it in salads, never thought of cooking it.  My family enjoyed it and tasty taste.  Sharing recipe with my friends.\nAnonymousMONTREAL, QUEBEC  CANADA4/29/2019my local Walmart grocery doesn't usually carry fennel, to my regret.  but i do have frozen collard greens that would probably shine in this sauce/marinade.  this might be enough spice for me.  if not, then i'll throw in some whole dried chilies.hollis5Vero Beach, FL3/25/2019This was pretty good. The sauce is solid on any crunchy vegetable. I cooked the fennel for about two minutes but then soaked it in cold salt water for an extra 20 minutes and it mellowed out a bit.AnonymousLos Altos, CA3/13/2019Maybe it needs to be cooked longer than the recipe states. This just did not go over well with 3 out of 4 fennel and spicy Korean food lovers. They flavor of the sauce was good. Maybe I would do this again with a different vegetable (cabbage, cucumbers, carrots...)AnonymousBuffalo, NY3/4/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titKoreanEast AsianAsianFennelVegetableSideStarterDairy-FreeGluten-FreeVegetarianHealthyishSimmerDinnerRecipes you want to make.
