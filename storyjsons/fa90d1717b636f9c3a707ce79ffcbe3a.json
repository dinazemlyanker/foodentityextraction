With baby boomers becoming the fastest growing cannabis consumers, even if your pops isn\u2019t hitting a vape, chances are he\u2019s read a headline about it. With CBD proliferating across the wellness world and the recent legalization of cannabis in Canada, older generations are letting go of stoner stereotypes and getting curious about weed 2.0.But, kind of like that one Thanksgiving when you taught a masterclass on emojis, your relatives will need an education on cannabis as well. The internet is a confusing place to learn about weed, so here\u2019s a handy guide to the most common questions you\u2019ll get asked about this brave new weed world...and how to handle them.Slow down, kid. Doesn\u2019t weed just get you high?Not all weed.There are over 140 known compounds found in weed, and only one gets you high. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) intoxicates users by binding to receptors in your central nervous system. You can breed plants to have higher or lower THC levels, which is why some weed can get you really, really high\u2014it\u2019s been GMO\u2019ed to be that way.THC also affects appetite and may reduce inflammation, but it\u2019s the other compounds in cannabis that may help regulate pain, treat acne, and reduce anxiety, no high included.So what\u2019s that trendy thing called? BSB? CBGB?Cannabidiol a.k.a CBD is another abundant compound found in cannabis. CBD is also found in hemp, which has low levels of THC and is gray-area legal. (The FDA recently approved its use in one drug\u2014Epidiolex.)  Unlike THC, from what we know, CBD doesn\u2019t bind to receptors in your central nervous system. Instead it interacts mostly with your CB2 receptors, which are found all over the body including the digestive tract, peripheral nervous system, epidermis, and immune cells.While it won\u2019t cure all your ills and file your tax returns, there are preliminary studies that indicate it helps with a host of things like pain, acne, and anxiety without the high. Combine that with it being technically legal in most states and you have the hottest trend in wellness.But weed is still illegal, right?It\u2019s complicated. If you live in one of the nine recreationally legalized states, it\u2019s legal. If you qualify for a medical condition in 30 states and get a medical card, it\u2019s legal. If you\u2019re in one of the 35 states that have a hemp pilot program, hemp-derived CBD is legal through your state\u2019s hemp pilot program.See? Very complicated.Not if you\u2019re in Canada. On October 17th, Canada became the first G7 country to legalize weed recreationally, meaning anyone who visits can buy it. Just make sure Uncle Ted doesn\u2019t try to bring any back, because that\u2019s a federal crime.Is hemp the same as weed? And is that carton of hemp milk going to get me high?The best way to think about hemp is that it\u2019s cannabis that\u2019s been bred to remove most of the THC. The U.S. government recognizes any cannabis plant that has less than .3% THC as industrial hemp. Currently, it\u2019s gray-area legal but will be legalized federally soon as Mitch McConnell (yes that Mitch McConnell) is pushing a controversial farm bill.If you\u2019re in a legalized state for cannabis, we recommend buying CBD, THC, and anything that is cannabis-based from a dispensary, which is a state-licensed store that has purity standards. If you\u2019re shopping for CBD on the unregulated hemp market, read this article.Will I get addicted to weed? It\u2019s so much stronger than when I was your age.Based on the research we have, you won\u2019t get addicted to CBD. THC does have addiction rates but they\u2019re lower than alcohol and cigarettes.If you\u2019re wondering why weed is so much stronger, it\u2019s because certain strains have been genetically modified to be that way. Much like you can breed corn to be pesticide-resistant, weed is just like any other agricultural product. Some strains have a lot of THC, some have very little. Age can also impact how you tolerate cannabis so, the older you get, the more careful you need to be.If you want something milder than Girl Scout Cookies (google it), try strains and products that have higher CBD than THC levels. Ratios that are 1:1 CBD:THC or higher are a safe bet for a mild high. Strains like ACDC, Charlotte\u2019s Web, Sweet and Sour Widow, or Stephen Hawking Kush (no lie) are all CBD-dominant or balanced strains that mitigate the impact of THC.If you have a history of addiction, we recommend speaking with your doctor before experimenting with any cannabis strains.What happens if I take too much CBD?Unlike shots of tequila, CBD has a bell curve response rate. More CBD doesn\u2019t mean stronger results. Everyone has their own \u201cGoldilocks Zone,\u201d and the only known side effect of taking too much CBD is drowsiness.My back hurts. Will weed help?For localized pain relief\u2014aching muscles, sore joints\u2014try a topical cannabis product. Topicals with THC can enter your bloodstream and make you high, so if you don\u2019t want that, use a CBD topical instead. CBD on its own has been shown to help with inflammation. That being said, there is some research on mice showing full-spectrum (whole plant including at least some THC) as a more effective way to consume CBD. If you aren\u2019t worried about trace amounts of THC, try the full-spectrum topical to see how you feel.Smoking is bad for you!We\u2019ve come a long way from bong rips and roaches. You rub cannabis on your face and joints, slap on a transdermal patch, or take a tincture and hold it under your tongue. In other words, smoking isn\u2019t the only way to feel the benefits of weed. The great thing about legalization? Better access to a wider range of products and more innovation.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishCannabisFamilyTrendsRead MoreLifestyleThese Sparkling CBD Drinks Have Replaced My La Croix Habit For GoodBy Annie DalyRecipes you want to make.
