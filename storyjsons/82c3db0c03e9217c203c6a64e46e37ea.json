It Involves BeesHere's how to get deeply-browned chicken skin in a hurry.By Alex DelanyMarch 20, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie CraigFacebookTwitterEmailA perfectly roast chicken with crispy, golden brown skin has been a symbol of home cooking excellence for...well, at least since Julia Child told us so. But sometimes achieving that most-desirable of hues can be a little easier said than done, especially when we're relying on the indirect, ambient heat of an oven\u2014rather than the direct heat of a grill or a hot skillet\u2014to get us there. If only there were some kind of hack that would ensure perfect skin every time, a trick that would produce chicken skin so golden that you could probably take it to one of those CA$H 4 GOLD places, and they\u2019d be like, \u201cOK. Here\u2019s some cash.\u201d Well, friends, there actually is. And whether we're working with a whole bird or a sheet pan full of thighs, it's a technique we turn to again and again.First things first: What's happening when chicken skin browns? Well, when any ingredient is exposed to high heat, the first thing that happens is surface moisture evaporates. Once enough water evaporates, something called the Maillard reaction starts to take place, whereby naturally occurring sugars and proteins begin to caramelize and are transformed by heat and time into a crazy array of complex and irresistible aromas. (If you really want to go deep on the science, check out this article.) It's what makes a crusty-seared steak so incredibly delicious, or a crackly French fry so much more tasty than a boiled potato. And it's what makes perfectly roasted chicken feel like the ultimate weeknight luxury.With enough time and high enough heat, you don't need any additives to get the kind of deep coloring you're after. But there are certain times where, for one reason or another, you really need to jumpstart that Maillard business\u2014say, when you're roasting chicken and a few other dinner components together on the same sheet pan. The secret? Honey. Incorporating something sweet like honey into your marinade or glaze, or even just brushing a very thin layer of the stuff on the outside of your chicken increases the sugar content that the heat is coming in contact with, getting you deeper color in a hurry.But it\u2019s not just honey. And it\u2019s not just chicken. Adding sugar of any sort to meats across the board will help get more impressive browning, whether it\u2019s something with a tad of sweetness, like soy sauce, or something with a high sugar content like maple syrup, agave, or pomegranate molasses. Sauces with high sugar content like barbecue sauce, ketchup, or hoisin sauce also work well when brushed over proteins. It\u2019s a one-two stroke of color and flavor.A honey glaze makes browned chicken thighs crisp up reeeaaal nice.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigAnd yeah, we have the recipes to back it up. A date-night pork chop that browns up super quick, leaving the inside juicy and pink? That'll do. How about a hoisin-glazed pork chop, because you can't have enough pork chops in your life? In there like swimwear. A roast chicken that\u2019s just waiting for a little brush of honey? You betcha. Some crispy chicken thighs with garlic-honey. Uhhhhh...yeah. We\u2019ve got those too.But here\u2019s the thing: the best part about this information is that you don\u2019t need a recipe to use it. You can just add a little bit of sugar to the marinades, glazes, and proteins you already love to cook. We\u2019re just here to help you get more from it. Kind of like that CA$H 4 GOLD spot you sold the chicken skin to. More gold. More dollar bills. More life.So.
