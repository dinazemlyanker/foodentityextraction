Fold in pistachios for texture and crunch, and serve this warm or chilled. If warm, you can scoop ice cream on top. If chilling, halwa can be set in a 9x9\" baking pan if you don\u2019t have ramekins.The spices in this recipe are the same ratio Mistry uses in their masala chai, so reserve any extra for use in tea.Find more of chef Preeti Mistry\u2019s Holi party recipes here.Ingredients8 Servings\u00bdcup raw pistachios12\" cinnamon stick1Tbsp. plus 1\u00bd tsp. green cardamom pods2tsp. black peppercorns2tsp. whole cloves5medium red beets (about 2 lb.), trimmed, scrubbed4cups whole milk4Tbsp. unsalted butter\u00bdcup (packed) light brown sugar1tsp. vanilla extractspecial equipmentA spice mill or mortar and pestlePreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 400\u00b0.

Transfer beets to a medium saucepan and add milk and butter. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until thickened, 16\u201320 minutes.

Cover and chill.How would you rate Beet Halwa With Pistachios?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (4)Back to TopTriangleFlavor is perfect, but per other commenters it needs MUCH longer than 20 minutes to cook down.  Maybe an hour+ on medium-low heat?  But it was pretty hands-off so it was easy to let it take the time it needed as I was working on other things in the kitchen.EmilyPittsburgh, PA10/14/2021Can you do a more keto version by using monk fruit sweetener instead of all that sugar.\nI never use sugar in anything now but do love halvah as I recalled it from childhood when we\nwere given lots of sweets.TamarqueNew Paltz, NY6/15/2021Same as the review below -- this took me about two hours total to get the milk to evaporate. It was worth it. I am East Indian and grew up with sweeter halwa, so next time I'd double, maybe triple the amount of sugar. But the spices are sublime and work really well with the beets, and the colors of the scarlet beets contrasted with the bright green of the pistachios are really spectacular.Anonymous3/28/2021I'm cooking this right now.  i'm not sure anyone tested this recipe as it's impossible to have 4 cups of a liquid and to cook it of in 15-20 minutes to it almost being completely evaporated.  I've been cooking mine for at least an hour and it's not done.  I even poured off some of the liquid and it's still not done.  \n\nOtherwise, it smells amazing and tastes so good.  I used a mix of beets and carrots.  I really like the earthiness of the vegies with the spices.
