But you can still show them you care\u00a0while also supporting your favorite spots by buying their merch and house-made pantry items\u2014all things that conjure up memories of sitting at a table filled with food, friends, and family. From spice rubs to jackets to sauces, these are the gifts that give back in 2020\u2014they help the restaurants we love because they\u2019re made by the restaurants we love.Tacos 1986 Coach\u2019s JacketWant to look like you coach a taco-eating team? (Yes.) Los Angeles mini chain Tacos 1986\u2019s jacket is the place to start. Whoever wears this bright red outerwear is clearly experienced in downing adobada tacos and mushroom quesadillas.Photo by Jessica PettwayCoach\u2019s Jacket$69 at Tacos 1986Sea Creatures Smoked HerringScan any menu from chef-owner Renee Erickson\u2019s Seattle restaurants and you won\u2019t find a fish-less one among them. Her Sea Creatures restaurant group knows their fish, which makes snapping up a tin of their smoked wild-caught Alaskan herring a no-brainer. The fillets are the perfect salty, buttery additions to toast. If that doesn\u2019t sell you, the illustration of a herring smoking a pipe should. (FYI: The actual tins and labels may vary, but it\u2019s all the same smoked herring inside.)Sea Creatures Smoked Herring$10 at Sea CreaturesNong\u2019s Khao Man Gai SauceYou know what all great marinades can do besides marinate? They can be used to dip or drizzle. And this sauce from chef-owner Nong Poonsukwattana of Nong\u2019s Khao Man Gai in Portland, OR, is just as good to marinate your chicken in as it is to dip your (cooked) chicken in. The combo of fresh ginger, local soy sauce, chiles, and garlic gets just about any job done.Aaron LeeNong\u2019s Khao Man Gai Sauce$12 at Nong\u2019s Khao Man Gai$17 at AmazonBen\u2019s Chili Bowl Classic Yellow T-ShirtA bowl of chili from Ben\u2019s is a timeless D.C. classic. And while you might not be eating a half smoke at Ben\u2019s, you can don a T-shirt with an illustration of a bowl of Ben\u2019s chili on it, which is also a timeless classic.Photo by Jessica PettwayBen\u2019s Classic Yellow T-Shirt$18 at Ben\u2019s Chili BowlXi\u2019an Famous Foods Chili OilWe can\u2019t imagine life without this spicy, tongue-tingling condiment on hand at all times. It\u2019s the thing that made us fall in love with Xi\u2019an Famous Foods in New York City, a small chain of western Chinese noodle shops run by owner Jason Wang. And we\u2019re here to remind you to stock up, in case you and your loved ones are running low on packets.Chili Oil Sampler Pack$16 at Xi\u2019an Famous FoodsMusang Wild Cat BlanketHere is a short list of situations where you could use this blanket: Sitting next to a festive bonfire, drinking a hot toddy. Standing in front of the fridge at 1 a.m., deciding on which Tupperware of leftovers to open. Or maybe eating lumpiang Shanghai and roast chicken slathered in adobo on the patio of Musang in Seattle, where this blanket that feels like your favorite hoodie comes from. That last option sounds pretty good to us.Photo by Jessica PettwayWild Cat Blanket$35 at Musang SeattleHell\u2019s Backbone Grill Spice RubBuying gifts for a person is one thing. But buying gifts for someone and their steak? That\u2019s next level. And this spice rub\u2014packed with chiles, cumin, and coriander and made by Hell\u2019s Backbone Grill & Farm in Boulder, UT\u2014falls into the category of being a gift for both.Photo by Jessica PettwayDesert in a Jar Spice Rub$14 at Hell\u2019s BackboneLil\u2019 Deb\u2019s Oasis CandlesIf you\u2019re sitting in a dark, vibe-less room, may we suggest lighting some candles? Perhaps a couple that Lil\u2019 Deb\u2019s Oasis\u2014a BA favorite restaurant, bar, and party zone in Hudson, NY\u2014produced in collaboration with candlemaker Essentially Charlie? Made from beeswax and coconut oil and fragrant with frankincense, cedar, and eucalyptus, these scented candles deliver both light and vibes.Essentially Charlie Gay Candle$25 at Lil\u2019 Deb\u2019s OasisEssentially Charlie Luck Candle$25 at Lil\u2019 Deb\u2019s OasisThe Grey Salted Honey PieChef-owner Mashama Bailey and pastry chef Natasha Gaskill know pie crust. At The Grey, in Savannah, it\u2019s a supremely flaky, buttery, golden vessel for whatever gets placed into it. And in this case, it\u2019s salted honey, which tastes like the gooey bottom layer of pecan pie but without the pecans.The Grey Salted Honey Pie$62 at GoldbellyRose\u2019s Fine Food SweatshirtChef-owner Molly Mitchell\u2019s family-run spot, Rose\u2019s Fine Foods, is our go-to for a couple mugs of coffee and made-from-scratch diner classics whenever we find ourselves in Detroit. The pierogies and pancakes from Rose\u2019s will warm your soul and body\u2014and so will this cake sweatshirt.Photo by Jessica PettwayCake Sweatshirt$35 at Rose\u2019s Fine FoodsLos Poblanos Green Chile JamWe can\u2019t stop dipping into this fire-roasted green chile jam from Los Poblanos, a beautiful plot of land that\u2019s home to floral gardens, an organic farm, Campo Restaurant, a boutique inn, and a farm shop in Los Ranchos de Albuquerque, NM. It\u2019s sweet, spicy, smoky, and floral\u2014best spread on toasted sourdough, served on a cheese plate, or hidden in a stocking by the fireplace.Green Chile Jam$16 at Los Poblanos Farm ShopExplore Bon App\u00e9titGift GuidesRestaurantsShoppingHoliday 2020Recipes you want to make.
