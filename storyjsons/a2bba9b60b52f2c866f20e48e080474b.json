Why? Because I had to carry it from the kitchen to the table, and I am clumsy, and that lemon butter sauce is very sloshy. But today, with nearly double that number of years under my belt, I can tell you that carrying a plate of chicken picatta across a restaurant swarming with crayon-wielding children is literally the only stressful thing about it.Everything else about this dish is comforting: the thin slab of dredged and browned chicken, the butter bath it swims in, the salty bursts of capers all around. It\u2019s my go-to order at any red sauce restaurant, not just because I am mildly lactose intolerant and overdosing on cheesy food makes it harder for me to continue ignoring that fact, but because it is a perfect dish. It\u2019s crispy-gone-soggy without ever having been that crispy in the first place. It\u2019s rich but light (well, compared to everything else on the menu). It goes perfectly with everything: a table-side Caesar, a pile of spaghetti marinara, a bottle of house red or house white. Chicken piccata will never let you down\u2014even when it\u2019s bad.And you know what else is comforting? That it\u2019s easy as hell to make a version that's definitely not bad at home.Hear me out, people, because I too am someone who once asked the question: Why would I ever make chicken piccata at home? It\u2019s one of those dishes that seems inextricably married to its surrounds, which is to say: a red-and-white checked tablecloth, a weird pastel mural of someplace vaguely resembling Capri, a waiter named Silvio who's been standing in front of that mural longer than you\u2019ve been alive.But what if you could conjure this exact experience without leaving your house?With this chicken piccata recipe, you can, and you will. Just like me, the officially titled Worst Cook at Bon App\u00e9tit, so you know when I say it\u2019s actually that easy, it\u2019s actually that easy. [Editor's note: Hilary is most definitely not the worst cook at BA.]Isn't she lovely? Isn't she wonderful?\nPhoto by Christina HolmesHere\u2019s what you do: Cut a couple chicken breasts in half, pound \u2019em (so fun! use whatever hard thing you have!), season with a bit of salt, and coat them in flour. Then cook them in a skillet\u2014no touching for two minutes so they get nice and brown on the bottom. Flip and cook for 30 more seconds, then give the cutlets a rest while you make the pan sauce.Pan sauce is simpler than it sounds: Take that skillet full of chicken-y juices and add some more olive oil, along with garlic, wine, capers, and butter. (Order and timing is important here, but that\u2019s what recipes are for.) Something beautiful called \u201cemulsion\u201d happens, and what you get is this gorgeous silky buttery sauce that you may want to drink but shouldn\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s for the chicken. Add lemon juice and you\u2019re done.The other great thing here is that this dish is very hard to mess up. One time I ran out of white wine and used ros\u00e9. One time I ran out of capers and used olives. One time I executed the rest of my dinner menu very badly and had to let my poor piccata sit in the pan for half an hour before serving. But never did she ever let me down\u2014not even once.So plate her up, jam a candle into an old wine bottle, and put on this Frank Sinatra playlist. Boom! Your tiny Brooklyn apartment is suddenly transformed into... the tiny Brooklyn red sauce joint down the street. And slosh that sauce all you want: No one is there to withhold your tip.ILY:Chicken PiccataSlices of chicken get dredged in seasoned flour, saut\u00e9ed in butter, and then smothered in an addictively tangy lemon-butter pan sauce.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titChickenItalian AmericanRed SauceNever FailRecipes you want to make.
