Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you\u2019ll get the scoop before everyone else.Love it or hate it......everyone knows the weekend after Thanksgiving is the time for deals. But you know what else it\u2019s the time for? Unsubscribing from every marketing email that you\u2019ve been absentmindedly deleting or ignoring for years.  (Note: If you\u2019ve read this far, the Healthyish newsletter is NOT one of those emails.) Do you know how many hours of our lives we waste hitting that trash can button?! Neither do I, but it\u2019s too many.I didn\u2019t plan to wage war on my inbox, but from the time I finished my second slice of pecan pie through Cyber F-ing Monday, I painstakingly scrolled to the bottom of every promo email I received and clicked \u201cunsubscribe,\u201d \u201copt out,\u201d or \u201cremove me from this list.\u201d I left feedback when required (\u201cI NO LONGER WANT TO RECEIVE THESE EMAILS\u201d) and moved on to the next.It was a days-long battle fought in silence and fueled by leftovers. When I woke up on Tuesday morning, I had only seven unread emails, all from actual, real people I knew. I\u2019d beaten the internet\u2026 for now.Make This StatElizabeth CecilI discovered a new-to-me BA recipe last weekend and fell madly in love. It\u2019s Andy Baraghani\u2019s turkey congee from the 2016 Thanksgiving issue, and it\u2019s the perfect way to eat leftovers without realizing that you\u2019re eating leftovers, and it feels kinda healthyish too. The recipe is super simple, especially if you already have leftover turkey stock hanging out in the fridge. It doesn\u2019t call for it, but I added a few cups of shredded turkey because I had plenty of that, and, instead of the shiitake mushroom topping, I sliced up the turkey skin and pan-fried it, then finished it off with soy sauce. If you still have leftover bird in your fridge, this is its grand finale.You know what else really works? This I-ran-out-of-nut-milk trick. I tried it this morning after discovering I was out of Oatly (what fresh horror!) using a couple tablespoons of cinnamon nut butter from Ground Up whirred in a blender with water, and my bowl of Weetabix (don\u2019t @ me) was better for it.This Week on HealthyishEmily Fiffer and Heather Sperling of Botanica.\nPhoto by Ren FullerWe launched a new column! Emily Fiffer and Heather Sperling are the co-owners of Botanica, a restaurant, market, and all-around good-vibes spot in Los Angeles, and they\u2019ll be writing regular dispatches from the Golden State. Their first column is about why they dropped their jobs in media and moved across the country to open a restaurant that \u201clavishes vegetables, fruits, and grains with the attention and respect they deserved.\u201d (Uh, yes, I\u2019m jealous). It\u2019s all dreamy and delicious.. until the power goes out on New Years Eve.Reads of the WeekAllison P. Davis\u2019s profile of Lena Dunham is remarkable for a lot of reasons, many of which you can read on the internet. I liked it for its subtlety, the artful way that Davis lays out Dunham\u2019s own words and actions to indict her. There are no contrived scenes, no skydiving or mini-golfing, just conversation in living rooms and bedrooms and kitchens. The quiet makes it so that everything Davis turns your attention toward\u2014mainly the total, all-encompassing narcissism of her subject\u2014comes through loud and clear.Some people are saying that the world didn\u2019t need to hear more about Lena Dunham, but I think that\u2019s missing the point of what a celebrity profile is. Did I care much about R. Kelly or Gwyneth Paltrow or J.R. Smith? LOL, no. But I read the hell out of those pieces\u2014I loved them, because they weren\u2019t just about a person with a lot of money, fame, talent, or luck. They were about us. It\u2019s a cliche, but the people we make famous are reflections of what we value and who we aspire to be. When a celebrity profile is done right, it shines that light right back on us so we\u2019re forced to talk about why we put that person on a pedestal in the first place.On another note, If I had a husband and he came home every night and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d I\u2019d probably stop cooking too.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish EditorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletteressayRead MoreLifestyleThese 6 Products Keep Me Healthy Through Every Stage of TravelingGallery6 SlidesBy Nancy Jo Iacoi Recipes you want to make.
