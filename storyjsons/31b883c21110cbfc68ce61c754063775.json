And this recipe is the moment to splurge on the best-quality tuna you can afford. (We love the meaty, sustainably caught Spanish tuna packed in buttery olive oil from Ortiz.)

I might mix it all into a salad and serve over greens, or eat with a knife and fork, but I had to wash my hands with soap and water after eating this. Very good, though. nelsonsBoston, MA3/2/2022Delicious with late summer tomatoes and some oil-packed mackerel (I didn't have any oil-packed tuna). The toppings were too numerous and unwieldy for just a single slice of toast per person so I split it out into two each and that was more manageable. My only critique is that there are a lot of moving parts for a quick toast meal but I'm already thinking of ways to simplify it. AnonymousOakland, CA9/19/2021This recipe is delicious! It is definitely a keeper. We used trefin tuna that we received as a Christmas gift and it put this recipe over the top. We had this for dinner on the first day of February 2021, in snowy Ohio and we feel like we are in the Mediterranean. Sue LanphierConcord Ohio2/2/2021its soooooo delicious. be sure to get a bread large enough to hold all the toppings or it will get too crowded. Lots of ingredients but totally worth it.Anonymous6/1/2020Wow! So easy and delicious. Glad I accidentally picked up the recommended tuna and stumbled across this recipe. Adding it to the regular rotation. AnonymousColumbus, Oh5/14/2020This is so delicious!! I splurged for the \"good\" tuna and, while it is lovely, don't think it is really worth it. Even with winter cherry tomatoes this was great.AnonymousNew York3/11/2020This quickly became my \"go to\" recipe over the summer.  I couldn't get enough!   I have been a tomato hater my whole life, but this simple trick of marinating them in lemon juice was a game changer.   All of the flavors in this recipe come together so nicely.   It just tastes like summer! AnonymousLos Angeles, CA9/26/2018Sounds and looks delicious but do we really need a recipe to boil an egg???AnonymousCalifornia9/6/2018Wouldn't change a thing.  Wish I could eat like this every night.  Can someone please put out a cookbook of \"toast\" dinner recipes?Los Angeles, CA8/16/2018OMG! That's what we said at the first bite. You need good summer garden tomatoes, good sourdough. We used TJ's albacore in olive oil, and drizzled the leftover oil over the top. So easy, and perfect for a hot summer evening with a nice rose.fraupSocorro NM6/25/2018It was even better than it looks.  And easy, too. I am looking forward to making it again!Cokiebee6/3/2018I was totally impressed by this.  I played fast and loose with measurements \u2014 don\u2019t be shy with the garlic or acids. After finishing I daydreamed about the next time I would be able to prepare this dish.AnonymousHouston 5/24/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titToastFrenchEuropeanTunaFishSeafoodOliveOther IngredientsEggTomatoVegetableEasyQuickWeeknight MealsSnackStarterMainDairy-FreeNut-FreeHealthyishLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
