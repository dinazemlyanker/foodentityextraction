It's just as delicious as it is versatile: You can use any combo of tender herbs (cilantro, mint, basil, parsley, dill, tarragon, chives), cultured dairy (yogurt, sour cream, buttermilk, labneh, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche), and acid (lemon juice, lime juice, unseasoned rice vinegar, apple cider vinegar) you'd like, which means you're never more than a whiz away from a batch. Mix it into shredded poached and chilled chicken breasts, high-quality canned tuna, chickpeas, or boiled-and-chopped eggs.\u00a0All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

The dressing is so fresh and flavorful and the dish is super easy. I served with salt and vinegar chips, as recommended, and scooped the salad up with the chips. My only complaint is that I used buttermilk as the dairy and found the dressing to be lacking heft. Next time I will use greek yogurt as recommended.nilssonsBoston, MA3/14/2022Yummy with the option of Greek Yogurt! Adjust garlic and amount of capers according to taste. AnonymousBoulder CO1/4/2022Anchvies..paste or little fishies......AliceAlbuquerque, NM11/9/2021Good lord this recipe. I have loved so so SO many recipes over the years for BA, but like..this one is my favorite. I love this so much I just about make it every week. I LOVE how quick, flavorful, and easy this is. Like you literally cannot go wrong. Herbs, dairy, acid. The formula is virtually unbreakable. My ~preferred~ version of this is using either plain kefir or whole milk Greek yogurt as the dairy, a whole, fresh lemon for acid, and the combo of herbs that are my fave are parsley, dill and basil (sometimes chives if I have them). I dream about this salad dressing. I wake up and crave it. The best way to eat either either with canned tuna or I usually cook chicken breasts in my crockpot and then used the shredded meat. I used romaine lettuce for the lettuce cups, as I prefer to I eat it that way rather than actually use it as a salad dressing, although that is great too!! But I will DIE on the hill that this needs to be served with salt and vinegar chips. Like please PLEASE take your extra dressing and use it as a chip dip. Please. For me. It\u2019s so worth it. \n\nI know Bon Appetit likes to compile the readers best recipes and I want everyone to know this is mine. This is the best recipe out here. And I have made and loved several others multiple times (pork Sambal noodles, BAs best chocolate chip cookies, etc) and this is still my top one. Taylor Y. Des Moines, IA10/13/2021Wowza!!!  Flavor bomb!!!  Love the flexibility.  I sought out this recipe as a way to use a boatload of not exactly crisp tarragon.  I was afraid it would knock over every other flavor.  No need to worry!  It is smashing!  I doubled the garlic (who can blame me?), threw in what was laying around in the fridge (chives, a few bits of parsley, and a fistful of past-it basil).  All those herbs plus the dairy and mayo managed to balance out with what I thought would be an overwhelming dose of tarragon.  I eyeballed the mayo, dairy, and oil, and I only had so much lemon, about 1 tbsp, because why dirty measuring spoons?  This approach is fun, but I think I erred on the oil/dairy balance.  While I ate my salad, the dressing looked like it wanted to break, or was maybe starting to do it.  I might have been too light on the mayo, or not emulsified it enough.  Betty Rubble0173010/13/2021Using only what I had in the kitchen , cilantro, parsley, chives, dill, Mayo, sour cream, garlic, capers, preserved lemon, olive oil\nAwesome! Added a little water to thin out.\nNext time I want to try tarragon parsley shallot .\nThis is a seriously excellent \u201cgo to\u201d dressing!\nBe creative & enjoy!AnonymousSaint Michael MD.8/29/2021Made this during quarantine watching Molly's live video; it was so deliciouuuus!\nI made mine with Tuna, mayo, sour cream, parsley and cilantro. Definitely making it again. Yannin2/4/2021WOW. This dressing though. Going to find any and all excuses to use it as much as I can. 10/10Raquelle New York1/21/2021So so so good! I come back to this recipe often. Love the dressing, love the crunch from the celery and chips, love that it is forgiving (have made without chicken, have made with many different herbs/ratio of herbs.) Like many other in the comments, usually just make as a salad or keep the romaine leaf how to use as a lettuce wrap or just dip the chips in the dip :)AnonymousSan Diego, CA12/10/2020dream salad and of course the dressing is to die for. I threw the dressing in a bowl with romaine, diced avocado and salt & vinegar chips and was licking the bowl at the end.\nperfect WFH lunch for one or many. New York10/30/2020dream salad and of course the dressing is to die for. I threw the dressing in a bowl with romaine, diced avocado and salt & vinegar chips and was licking the bowl at the end.\nperfect WFH lunch for one or many. New York10/30/2020yum! used cilantro, basil, mint, and scallion and cut down on the oil/dairy.Anonymous9/11/2020I LOVE this dressing!! Used chives, parsley, and cilantro because it\u2019s what I had on hand. Just made it for the second week in a row. Personally wasn\u2019t a fan of the serving suggestions but found it delicious with chicken a tortilla wrap or just over a salad. AnonymousVictoria, BC7/27/2020This dressing is killer. Personally, the food styling made no sense to me so I just mixed it all up as a regular salad and it was fine that way. Salt & vinegar chips on the side or crumbled on top take it to the next level for sure. AnonymousSaint Paul, MN7/1/2020This may be a dumb question, but how are you meant to eat this salad? Are you supposed to mix it all together, or eat it more like a veggie/snack platter? The deconstructed component threw me off, so I ate mine as a bed of lettuce with toppings all thrown together.  I used hard boiled eggs and while it was fine, I think I'd go a different route with the protein next time. I'm super excited to mix and match different ingredients to find my fav combo because this dressing is wonderful! I love how simple and riffable this recipe is.AnonymousAustin, TX6/30/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladAmericanChickenPoultryChicken BreastAvocadoVegetableLettuceLeafy GreensButtermilkOther IngredientsYogurtEasyMainGluten-FreeNut-FreeKetoLunchDinnerBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
