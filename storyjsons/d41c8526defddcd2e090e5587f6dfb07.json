That\u2019s how buying flour usually goes for me. I have intense brand loyalty to the tiny flour king. But then I got a copy of Friends & Family co-owner Roxana Jullapat\u2019s fantastic upcoming cookbook (the season\u2019s most exciting release), Mother Grains, and suddenly I needed some spelt flour, STAT.In the February issue of Bon App\u00e9tit, we went deep with Roxana on why baking with whole grain flours is more exciting than boring ol\u2019 all-purpose (you\u2019ll always need that on hand, too, because a lot of these other grain flours lack its gluten levels). Whole grains are also better for you\u2014so much fiber\u2014and many are better for the environment too. Why aren\u2019t they right next to the all-purpose flour in the baking aisle, though? I had to track down spelt, rye, buckwheat, and rice flours at a great bulk foods store where I live in Ann Arbor called By the Pound. My farmers market carries local cornmeal! I\u2019m spoiled, and lucky. Depending on where you are, you might have a harder time finding more obscure flours, especially einkorn flour, a type of flavorful wheat that makes nutty, near-savory shortbread that I made over and over this past holiday\u2014recipe here.Good thing the internet exists!These are Roxana\u2019s favorite mills with online stores. When in doubt, Bob\u2019s Red Mill makes a solid handful (sorry, not einkorn) and they\u2019re reliably fresh and consistent. Roxana-approved. (And not sponsored!)Grist & Toll\u201cI have not used better flour in the entire country,\u201d Roxana says. \u201cIt\u2019s the mill I recommend the most for their Sonora wheat and spelt as well as their hard white and hard red flours.\u201d Use the tender, tasty Sonoran wheat for pie crust, cakes, and any pastry really. Use the spelt to make these blueberry muffins and the hard white and hard red flours for breads. And good news: They have einkorn! If you pick up some rye flour and a banneton, you can make Roxana\u2019s no-knead beer bread too.\u00a92020Anson MillsTry ALL of the cornmeals. For baking, go with the fine grind for baked goods with delicate, fine crumbs\u2014makes sense, right?\u2014like cakes, cookies, and this ricotta pound cake. (Note: Different cornmeal colors bring different flavors. Try blue! Roxana prefers white in the pound cake recipe: \u201cFor me, white cornmeal seems so rare. It\u2019s cool. It has a more subtle flavor, but it\u2019s not lacking anything.\u201d Yellow has a more corn-forward flavor; I like that.) Coarse cornmeal is your cornbread friend: It creates that little bit of crunch and squeak. But don\u2019t stop there. Anson Mills\u2019s \u201ctoasted oat flour is my go-to,\u201d Roxana adds. It has an \u201cintense nuttiness,\u201d a sweet cereal-like flavor, and is great in pancakes, these gluten-free apple muffins, and the banana bread in Mother Grains (just preorder it already!). While you\u2019re shopping, you might as well pick up some buckwheat flour to make this chocolate souffl\u00e9-like cake, and this Japanese buckwheat to make soba when the mood strikes (Japanese Home Cooking is the cookbook you\u2019ll need for that). Chewy farro? Purple \u201clong lost\u201d beans? Add to cart.Capay MillsCapay has the deep cuts, milled-to-order. You\u2019re here \u201cfor rare wheats (like Sonora White flour),\u201d Roxana says. And almost purple blue cornmeal. Bread heads will nerd out over the Red Bug Nouveau, and why shouldn\u2019t they? It produces an airy, wide crumb, so you can hold your slice of bread up to the sun and let the light shine in.Maine Grains\u201cGet the \u00d8land wheat flour, an heirloom from Scandinavia,\u201d Roxana says (then use it as you would whole wheat flour; see below for swapping tips). Maine Grains is a one-stop shop: Pick up some chewy rolled oats to make granola scones, stock up on buckwheat flour, spelt, and then make impulse purchases like sourdough starter, hay straws, and a cute dishcloth knitting kit.Wade\u2019s MillWade\u2019s Mill\u2019s Bloody Butcher cornmeal is an awesome, ancient variety first grown by Native Americans; it gets its name from the red-and-brown specks in the yellow cornmeal. Roxana uses it in her Cotija cornbread in Mother Grains (I made it and can testify to its greatness). Wade\u2019s Mill also sells a variety of whole grain flours, plus some good gift-y baking kits, and you can\u2019t not add on a jar of Traffic Jam.Hayden Flour MillsWe are here for some pasta flour, people. Can\u2019t go wrong with a box of heirloom all-purpose. Roxana\u2019s a fan of Hayden\u2019s semolina as well, which she told me she swaps for cornmeal (semolina is ground-up durum wheat while cornmeal is ground-up corn, so they have similar textures) in the ricotta pound cake recipe, then adds a little anise and orange zest to for an Italian pastry vibe. And speaking of cornmeal, Hayden has a LIMITED EDITION one now! Better get on that.*A note on boldly experimenting with whole grain flours, a thing you should do:Play with these flours in nearly everything you\u2019re baking (bread is trickier). Roxana tries out new flours in chocolate chip cookies and suggests them pancakes or waffles too. A general rule of thumb is to use a ratio of 25:75 whole grain flour to AP flour and work your way up to 50:50. In pie crust, be prepared to add more moisture to hydrate those whole grain flours. Even the tiniest addition of some whole grain flour will deepen the flavor of what you\u2019re baking, and you\u2019ll find it\u2019s hard to go back to plain ol\u2019 all-purpose flour after this.Now go and bake these recipes!1 / 7ChevronChevronRicotta Cornmeal Pound CakeView RecipeRecipes you want to make.
