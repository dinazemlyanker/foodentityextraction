A quick and easy stir fry recipe was the highlight of Alex Beggs\u2019s week, plus more from her Friday newsletter.By Alex BeggsMay 23, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Laura Murray, food styling by Rebecca JurkevichFacebookTwitterEmailEvery Friday morning, Bon App\u00e9tit senior staff writer Alex Beggs shares weekly highlights from the BA offices, from awesome new recipes to office drama to restaurant recs, with some weird (food!) stuff she saw on the internet thrown in. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.\u2018Gussed upWith two bunches of fat, new season asparagus from Detroit\u2019s Eastern Market (the only place I\u2019m a regular now), I made this pork and asparagus stir fry + side of white rice earlier in the week. The next day we used the leftover rice and a stray Ball Park Frank to make hot dog fried rice and it\u2019s too bad we don\u2019t have a recipe for that, but you can use your imagination.Get the recipe: Pork and Asparagus Stir FryWant this letter before it hits the website?

I was bear-squatting (new move) during an Aaptiv workout called \u201cBuns on Deck\u201d with my favorite trainer, Ackeem, who had me envisioning my flattened back as a surface for condensating water glasses and bowls of peanuts. \u201cI\u2019m EXERCISINGGGGG\u201d I grunted to no one.I\u2019ve found small ways to stay active in isolation, and using this audio workout app is what\u2019s been working for me. Until I injured my knee squatting in front of the fridge looking for snacks, things were going great. Now I\u2019ve got to ice it and recover. Hope your week was better!My sister\u2019s was. She made the Basically billionaire bars, which she calls \u201cenhanced Twix,\u201d and stashed the remainder of the batch in her freezer. That\u2019s the only way I could make this opening section about a recipe for you to click!!Make them: Tahini Billionaire BarsAlex LauAs our lives change, from whateverBefore I became a young professional, I was a nanny to a boy named Henry and next week he is graduating high school, well, sort of. Virtually. Remotely. Via Zoom? Who knows. All I know is I won\u2019t be able to go and that makes me sad. I didn\u2019t know how to cook a damn thing when I was in charge of his well-being, so I blanched a lot of broccoli. One evening, while I was watching the broccoli float in a pot of boiling water, Henry walked over cradling his cat, Mr. Victor, and said, \u201cAlex, Mr. Victor wants a kiss on the head!\u201d and suddenly Mr. Victor\u2019s tail swipes under the broccoli pot and IS ON FIRE. I said a very bad word! There was much shrieking! We patted the tail out with a kitchen towel. Mr. Victor scurried away with his singed tail-tip but the scent of burnt hair in the kitchen remained.Congratulations, Henry!Photo by Alex LauGood morningI love love loved this piece by Dwight Garner about breakfast in (great) books. Best read with brown butter oatmeal and hot coffee. \u201cI\u2019d like to be more like Ralph Ellison,\u201d says Garner, \u201cwho wrote to a friend that he dismayed people \u2018with the vast damage I could do to a pan of biscuits.\u2019\u201d I also had no idea how much James Bond liked scrambled eggs!Haha but reallyUnnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekAlex LauTucked in a Slack channel where articles are previewed, Adam Rapoport dropped a controversial take: \u201cI would like to officially go on record as saying that spring is bullshit.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve said this on every Zoom I\u2019ve been on with you,\u201d replied Emily Schultz, rolling her eyes through the WiFi wavelengths. \u201cOmg that is old news everyone knows spring is BS,\u201d added known abbreviator Molly Baz. Meryl Rothstein even wrote about Spring Suckage last year. Wow! Who knew people had so many feelings about SEASONS. Here I was, just enduring them one after the next, year after year! \u201cI'm eating rhubarb under a down comforter,\u201d grumped bed-dweller Christina Chaey. \u201cSpring is the worst season,\u201d said Emmy-nominated weatherman Alex Delany: \u201cIt\u2019s fall but instead of wanting to put a coat on, you want to take one off. And it's raining.\u201d Carla Lalli Music mused on the shortcomings of spring in the Northeast, where \u201cour farmers\u2019 market right now has: 9-month old apples, pock-marked radishes, and year-old maple syrup. And you have to get in a fistfight for some ramps.\u201d Sohla El-Waylly came in cold: \u201cI\u2019m firmly anti-summer and want it to be winter year-round.\u201d \u201cI like spring,\u201d said Sarah Jampel, but her three words sort of dissipated into the breeze like dandelion fuzz.(For the record I\u2019m pro-spring, pro-rhubarb daiquiris.)Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecookingThis Pink Drink Is My Favorite Way to Consume RhubarbBy Alex BeggscookingAn Asparagus Stir-Fry That\u2019ll Get the Whole Family to the TableBy Deb PerelmancookingHow to Buy the Best Tahini For the JobBy MacKenzie Chung FegancookingRhubarb Shrub is Spring in a BottleBy Al CullitonRecipes you want to make.
