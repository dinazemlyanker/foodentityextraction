Feeling at home is something else entirely.By Christina ChaeyJune 14, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Marcus Nilsson, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Amy WilsonFacebookTwitterEmailEvery other week, Bon App\u00e9tit associate editor Christina Chaey writes about what she\u2019s cooking right now. Pro tip: If you sign up for the Healthyish newsletter, you\u2019ll get the scoop before everyone else.For the last week, I\u2019ve been re-using a to-go plastic iced coffee cup as my water glass and eating most meals out of the same single plastic takeout container that I\u2019m treating as a bowl. Yep\u2014I\u2019m moving! And Mercury is fully freaking out and ensuring that the whole process is as nightmarish as possible. (For starters, my pantry flooded with brown water during two flash floods last week.)But then I remember that by the time this newsletter goes out, I\u2019ll be inhabiting a new kitchen, one that is very much my own (okay it\u2019s a rental, but still). I\u2019ve dreamed of this moment ever since I graduated college ten years ago, and I\u2019ve got the (secret) Pinterest boards to prove it. At 32, I\u2019ve never lived without roommates, and thus have never gotten the opportunity to creative-direct the common areas of my homes. I also spent most of my twenties moving at least once a year (sometimes more!), and during that decade I got very attached to the idea of living a minimalist-nomadic lifestyle: Amass as little as possible, because this is not your home-home. And also, moving is a pain in the ass. And ALSO, will your roommates actually take care of that Japanese chef\u2019s knife you\u2019ve been coveting? Didn\u2019t think so.Over time, my living circumstances nudged me to be okay with the state of being at home rather than feeling at home. I never hung art on my bedroom walls, never painted, never even so much as bought a throw pillow for (not my) living room couch. If I\u2019m being honest, I don\u2019t feel like I know how to create a home just for me, and sitting with that has been unsettling and anxiety-provoking in turn. It makes me feel behind, somehow.But I do know a thing or two about the kitchen, and I\u2019ve been finding comfort in planning out the kind of space I want this next kitchen to be. I\u2019ve been slowly amassing the things I\u2019ve always wanted to own: nice towels to wipe my hands dry after the last dish of the night is done; cloth napkins for all the future dinners; the big solid-wood butcher block cutting board I hope to have long enough to pass down one day. They feel like representations of an idea of home I\u2019ve only ever held in my head, one that I\u2019m now getting a chance to manifest in life. I\u2019ve got that nice Japanese chef\u2019s knife in my virtual cart right now, by the way; I guess it\u2019s finally time.Quick Hits for Cooking Limbo:Photo by Alex Lau, food styling by Susie Theodorou, prop styling by Elizabeth JaimeSpaghetti Al Limone with AsparagusUltimate BLTTomato Toast with Chives and Sesame SeedsEveryday Greens SaladSpicy Braised TofuSheet-Pan GnocchiExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishWhat's Chaey Cooking?essayRecipes you want to make.
