When something\u2019s so easy to make that you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.This might come as a surprise, but even though I share a lot of my own recipes on Tiktok, I don\u2019t spend a ton of time on the app. Sure, there\u2019s a seemingly infinite amount of food and cooking videos to scroll through (a vortex), but I have a job to do, and apparently watching recipe videos in the test kitchen doesn\u2019t count as \u201cresearch.\u201d Still, the algorithm is efficient, so rest assured that if there\u2019s a hot new trend on #FoodTok, it\u2019s going to show up on my For You Page right away. And if it\u2019s really good, it\u2019ll probably show up more than once as others on the app re-create, rehash, and riff on the recipe.That\u2019s how, during a quick scroll through TikTok in bed at a totally normal hour, I found this phyllo crinkle cake recipe. First, I saw the original video by Ramena from @RamenaSaidWow, where she cleverly folds sheets of phyllo dough together like an accordion, then douses them with butter, sugar syrup, and a simple custard. Ooooh, wow, I thought looking at the crispy-crackly end result, that looks gooooood. So I did what I do with all of the best-looking recipes: Tossed it a heart and swiped on with my evening.TikTok contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.But the phyllo crinkle cake kept popping up. Other creators on the app were going wild for the crispy, crunchy layers of folded phyllo, raving over the pillowy insides, bread pudding-esque flavor, and the recipe\u2019s undeniable simplicity. Don\u2019t get me wrong: Not every TikTok recipe that takes off is a masterpiece. But Ramena\u2019s multi-bake technique\u2014which manages to soak up butter, custard, and a sugar syrup without creating a soggy pastry\u2014seemed almost too good to be true. But after giving it a shot or three, I\u2019m happy to report that this phyllo crinkle cake is well worth the hype. With a few simple ingredients, these fluffy croissant-like layers are only an hour away.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Here\u2019s how to make it:To make Ramena\u2019s recipe, start by holding 2 sheets of phyllo dough by the corners, like you\u2019re shaking out a bedsheet. Scrunch the sheets up into a fluffy accordion about 1\" thick. I highly recommend watching Ramena\u2019s original TikTok to get the technique down so you can achieve that trademark crinkle. Lay it into a parchment lined 13x9\" baking pan\u2014folds facing upward\u2014and repeat until the baking pan is full. Then bake the phyllo on its own for 10 minutes at 350\u00b0.After the first bake, drizzle 1 cup melted unsalted butter evenly over the phyllo. Bake for another 10 minutes. During this bake, whisk together 1 cup milk, 2 eggs, 1 cup sugar, and 1 Tbsp. vanilla extract in a medium bowl until combined. Remove the phylo from the oven and pour the custard evenly over the phyllo before returning to the oven until the top is golden and crispy, 30\u201340 minutes.Last, you\u2019ll want to prepare the syrup by simmering 1 cup sugar, 1 cup water, and 1 tsp. lemon juice in a small saucepan over medium heat. The sugar syrup won\u2019t go back into the oven, so you should aim to reduce the liquid until the texture is slightly thicker than simple syrup to avoid a soggy cake. Remove the cake from the oven and drizzle syrup on top. Then allow the cake to cool before cutting and serving.It\u2019s a brilliantly simple recipe, practically begging to be customized. So far I\u2019ve tried a rosewater version using floral extract in the syrup, another with chai spices mixed into the custard, and a nuttier take with crumbled pistachios sprinkled on top. The genius of the cake is that there\u2019s room to riff at pretty much every step. Bake some fruit on top during the last trip to the oven, replace the sugar syrup with a drizzle of dulce de leche, or stud chocolate chips into the phyllo folds. There's an infinite scroll of content\u2014I mean, of potential. Whatever you do though, don\u2019t sleep on Ramena\u2019s recipe.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimplecookingRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
