Instead, I\u2019m the sort that runs to the store twice in one hour because I forgot the lemons the first time, and I rarely eat the same meal with any degree of frequency. There is, however, a beacon of strict order among all of this chaos\u2014a biweekly taco night, never to be missed and always fervently anticipated.Lately, the Adobo Mushroom Tacos from Edgar Castrej\u00f3n\u2019s book Provecho: 100 Vegan Mexican Recipes to Celebrate Culture and Community are my taco night go-to. With toasty tortillas wrapped around crispy-chewy, spicy-sweet mushrooms and piles of toppings of your choice, no two tacos are ever the same.\u00a0They taste smashing, yes, but even more compelling is how dead easy they are to make. Step 1: Toss mushrooms\u2014any kind!\u2014with Castrej\u00f3n\u2019s adobo spice blend, a splash of lime juice, and oil. Step 2: Roast them in a hot oven until crisp. Step 3: Gather your cadre of toppings, like sour cream, salsa, cilantro, and/or hot sauce. Step 4: Eat tacos; live your best life. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the recipe!Provecho$32 $22 at AmazonUsing a mix of mushrooms makes for the most interesting flavor with a variety of textures. Aim to have at least one frilly, fluted type, such as chanterelle (the author\u2019s favorite), maitake, or oyster, and one meatier kind, like crimini or king trumpet, which will retain their heft. Then tear them by hand so that the irregular pieces get crisp around the edges in the heat of the oven.\u00a0I usually double the mushrooms because they\u2019re good for so many meals. I\u2019ll scoop leftovers over ricotta toast the next morning, build a giant lasagna, or tuck a spoonful into a grilled cheese. (When scaling up, I split the mushrooms over two baking sheets for the most even cooking.)If you\u2019re a meat eater, you won\u2019t miss it here. Throughout his book, Castrej\u00f3n sets out to make delicious, satisfying recipes that pay homage to the flavors and traditions of Mexican and Latin cooking and just so happen to be plant-based. There\u2019s a bold coliflor asada, an ingenious coconut aguachile, and jackfruit tinga tostadas, the first vegan dish Castrej\u00f3n debuted to his family. By taking away the animal protein, a dish might become a distillation of pure flavor and technique. Or, as is the case of these mushroom tacos, it might become simple enough to persevere in my weekly meal rotation, against all odds.Get the recipe:Adobo Mushroom TacosMeaty mushrooms get spiced to perfection and roasted until crisp before they're tucked into warm corn tortillas.View RecipeRecipes you want to make.
