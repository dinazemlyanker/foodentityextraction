It\u2019s simple: Just use more herbs. Instead of adding them by the pinch (a teaspoon of chopped mint here, a precious parsley leaf there), add them by the handful. It might sound silly, but trust us: This is groundbreaking stuff.There\u2019s a good chance that a recipe that calls for a couple teaspoons or a few tablespoons of chopped herbs can handle a bit more. If you\u2019re using a versatile, cuisine-crossing soft herb like basil, parsley, mint, dill, or cilantro, consider the called-for amount as a guideline rather than a commandment. (With super-pungent herbs like oregano, marjoram, or tarragon, however, we suggest treading more lightly.)  Even if a recipe doesn\u2019t call for herbs at all (blasphemy!), there are plenty of dishes that will nearly always benefit from a mess of your chopped-up orphan herbs: a frittata, any green or grain salad, your standard-issue yogurt dip.MAKE. IT. RAIN.\nTED+CHELSEA CAVANAUGHSo be generous: You\u2019ll be rewarded with ordinary meals that feel fresher and more alive\u2014like a room where you just opened up all the windows! Like the first day that\u2019s warm enough to feel a breeze on your bare legs!\u2014and you\u2019ll have saved your precious greens from unjust demise.If the situation really gets dire\u2014say, you\u2019re planning to skip town in the morning and staring down three older bunches\u2014sauce is the solution: Green sauce\u2014whether it\u2019s chimichurri, pesto, salsa verde, or something you just made up by mixing and matching herbs, oils, and vinegars in your food processor\u2014comes together in minutes and tastes as good smeared across a slice of toast as it does spooned over seared fish or plain old scrambled eggs. And since green sauce lasts for weeks in the fridge, you\u2019ve just given those bunches a new lease on life.Or, even better, stash some green sauce in the freezer: You\u2019ll thank yourself next winter, when fresh, vibrant bunches are few and far between, and the thought of letting one wilt is truly unimaginable.Just chop 'em up and throw 'em in a salad dressing!Every Night Salad with Yogurt RanchThis crunchy romaine number, drizzled with a creamy, craveable yogurt-based homemade ranch dressing, is the kind of salad that goes with just about anything, from delivery pizza to pan-seared pork chops.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyherbParsleyBasilDillCilantroRecipes you want to make.
