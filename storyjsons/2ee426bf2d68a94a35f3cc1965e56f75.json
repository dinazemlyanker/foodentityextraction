Everything I said then is still true today: It makes grocery shopping infinitely easier, because I can buy what I need, not just what I can comfortably carry. You shouldn\u2019t have to be a powerlifter to be able to bring home a case of seltzer and a couple canned tomatoes.But now, a granny cart is even more invaluable. With most of us making grocery runs as infrequently as possible, a couple tote bags will barely get you through the bean aisle. My granny cart fits a serious weekly shop for my family: a few dozen eggs, the several tubs of yogurt we manage to go through, a few packages of meat and tofu, a modest collection of canned goods, plus plenty of produce including bulky bunches of kale. Definitely a frozen pizza. Plus, I don\u2019t have to worry about sterilizing the germy communal handlebar of a grocery store shopping cart.I have this one, but if I were buying one right now, I\u2019d go with a bigger model like this. You know, just in case I happened upon a 24-pack of toilet paper.Whitmor Deluxe Utility Cart$53 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingCoronavirusHighly RecommendRead MoreCoronavirusWhat to Know About Shopping and Cooking During CoronavirusBy Jesse SparksRecipes you want to make.
