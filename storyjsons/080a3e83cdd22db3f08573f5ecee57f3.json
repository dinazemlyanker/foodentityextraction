It\u2019s sort of like a star sign in that way. You were born this way! That\u2019s why your December horoscope is a complicated Starbucks beverage, which is somehow not sponsored. We were just in the mood, probably because of the holiday cups. So get it line, enunciate your name, and stop looking for the CDs at checkout\u2014they don\u2019t do that anymore.AriesIf recent deep thinking has given you a headache, this month, get plenty of fresh air. Lighten up and loosen your grip. Whatever issue you\u2019re trying to solve, don\u2019t pressure yourself to figure it out in one swoop. And you\u2019ll have plenty of time to mull it over when you\u2019re in line at Starbucks waiting for your Pumpkin Spice Latte with an extra shot of espresso, which you tell the cashier twice, emphatically. The cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove vibe with your innate warmth. But that extra shot of espresso? Not gonna help you solve that problem any faster, Aries.TaurusIt\u2019s HAPPENING, Taurus. Your romantic life is about to get heated. Hot. Passionate. But curveballs may also be on the menu for you and your partner this month. Best advice? Try to be open. Some salty surprises might turn out to be incredibly sweet... like a Salted Caramel Mocha Frappuccino (with extra pump of \u201cmocha sauce\u201d). Just don\u2019t overdo it on that sauce.GeminiA full moon in your own sign mid-month is a good omen. You did it, brainy Gemini. Look at the beautiful creation (or mess) you\u2019ve made in 2019. Remember to breathe and keep it simple this month. Order a drink that\u2019ll help you stay level, a Nitro Flat White. There\u2019s sweet espresso in there, and nitrogen-infused milk that creates a velvety layer of not-quite-foam on top. So stable. So in control. So in the moment.CancerIt\u2019s the end of the year and you\u2019re feeling DONE-ZO. Certain relationships have run their course and in fact, you\u2019ve got a whole 2019 ditch list in the works. Nice. 2020 is going to start with a bang of introspection and self-care, which is why you\u2019re suddenly ordering a Chestnut Praline Latte with Coconut Milk. You know what you like, secretly-highly-particular Cancer, so go ahead, ask the barista for those holiday sugar sparkles on top too.LeoYou\u2019re super energetic and driven this month, checking off your holiday to-do list like a well-caffeinated elf in Santa\u2019s workshop. But you\u2019re also competitive by nature, so there\u2019s that. Whether you\u2019re burning the midnight oil finishing an assignment for work or composing a Tik Tok masterpiece, look alive and stay hydrated with a hot pink Hibiscus Lemonade Refresher (freeze-dried berries optional). Remember that sometimes ya gotta cool down, fiery Leo.VirgoYou take the things you love seriously, Virgo, from your favorite books to hosting themed holiday parties. But you\u2019re also crafty and creative, and that\u2019s where you thrive artistically and professionally. Indulge your crafty side this month by ordering the secret Off-Menu Butterbeer Latte. Toffee nut, caramel, and cinnamon dolce syrups get in there somehow. There\u2019s extra caramel on top. You can admit it\u2019s mostly sugar, and that you\u2019re definitely a Hufflepuff\u2014and that\u2019s why we love you.LibraAs an air sign, you spend a lot of time in your own head. But this month, you\u2019re onto something brilliant. Your work life is headed in a productive new direction because you\u2019re learning to work smarter, not harder. You\u2019ve heard that one before, right? Fuel that whirring brain with a Green Tea Almond Milk Latte. Like you, it\u2019s a study in balance: sweet and bitter, herbaceous and creamy all at once.ScorpioYou\u2019re as calculated as they come, Scorpio, but lately you\u2019ve been more breezy\u2014buying generous holiday gifts (for yourself), picking up the tab at the holiday office party after-party. So this month you\u2019ll get serious again about your long-term financial goals. You might be cleaning up your act, but you\u2019ll still need a sweet and spicy Dirty Chai Latte. That extra shot is just like you: determined to get sh*t done.SagittariusYou typically fly by the seat of your pants, but life just got real, didn\u2019t it? You need to get focused...or at least procrastinate less. Whether you\u2019re trying to finish a program/degree/1000-piece puzzle or sell your house, you\u2019ll be hyper-aware of time this month. And you might spend some time waiting for the barista to prepare the fantastical off-menu \u201cPink Drink\u201d\u2014a concoction of acai, rehydrated strawberries, passionfruit, and coconut milk. We\u2019re not sure how much it\u2019ll help you get focused, but at least it\u2019s a nice distraction from that serious stuff.CapricornYou\u2019ll be feeling like a boss this month (but aren\u2019t you always?) You\u2019ll be \u201cgood-busy\u201d with year-end parties and events. Whatever you put a lot of energy into this year is going to see some payoff\u2014or some celebration. Pre-game all the parties with a Caffe Misto with cinnamon powder dusted on top. It\u2019s just caf\u00e9 au lait but it sounds fancier this way, doesn\u2019t it? If you\u2019re craving fancy this month, Capricorn, don\u2019t shy away from it.AquariusAnxious much? You never really show it, but yes, big changes in your personal life are approaching and your gears will be constantly churning this month. If you need to blow off some steam, reach out to your friends\u2014they\u2019ll be there for you, as the song goes. Swap your usual cortado order for a sort of ridiculous Nitro Cold Brew with Sweet Cream. Like you, it\u2019s much sweeter than it gives on.PiscesThis has been a big year of dreams coming true for you, Pisces. Maybe not all of them, but hey, you\u2019re a dreamer by nature and that\u2019s a lot to keep up with. This month, contemplate how you might like to give back so that others can get ahead too. You\u2019ve always had elaborate Starbucks orders, but have you tried the Cocoa Cloud Macchiato? A dense layer of fluffy foam holds up a mess of three types of syrup that would impress Jackson Pollock. It\u2019s sweet and ridiculous, just like you.Catherine Urban is an astrologer in Cleveland is the author of Your Astrological Cookbook: The Perfect Recipe for Every Sign.Explore Bon App\u00e9titFood HoroscopesStarbucksRecipes you want to make.
