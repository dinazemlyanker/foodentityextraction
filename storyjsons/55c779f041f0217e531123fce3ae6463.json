The perfect serving size of nachos is in helmet form, and I will accept no arguments on this.By Alex BeggsOctober 7, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Kate FenoglioFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.I\u2019m squeezing this story into the tail-end of baseball season, the playoffs. I\u2019m rooting for the Astros, because my Tigers didn\u2019t make it happen this year. But my real MLB MVP is a Baseball Helmet Full of Nachos, which you can find at nearly every baseball stadium. I\u2019m not a Yankees fan, but I am a big fan of their stadium\u2019s helmet of hot cheese, pictured above. Comerica Park gets it done too. And this spring, I encountered fresh jalape\u00f1os, instead of pickled, at Citi Field. Wow!No matter what is happening in the game (grown men swinging bats), or in the stands (grown men pushing children out of the way to snatch foul balls), nachos give everything a happy Cheez Whiz glow. Unlike cold, soggy fries, or overcooked, dry sausages, there\u2019s little room for disappointment here. The helmet, which you can bring home and plant some succulents in or whatever, ensures that you get a ridiculous but sufficient amount of chips, and plus, they\u2019re just festive to behold.\u201cBut the normal tray of nachos is enough,\u201d you might be thinking, or, \u201cI need to save room for a hot dog and some Dippin\u2019 Dots and three beers,\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t really be spending $20 on nachos right now, Beggs.\u201d But I believe you can, and should. The tray is not enough! Especially to share!The helmet nachos are pretty much the same at every stadium, but there\u2019s an art to ordering. Here\u2019s how I do it: Skip the mystery meat. It\u2019s never good, and it gives me the runs (baseball pun!). Ask kindly for the nacho artist to weave in layers of cheese and pickled jalape\u00f1os ONLY, then kindly ask for extra jalape\u00f1os on top. That\u2019s it. A thing of beauty, of cheese and heat and crunch and salt. Share with people you love. Root, root, root for the home team. If they don\u2019t win, it\u2019s fine because you had a helmet full of nachos.Go there: Yankee StadiumExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendNachosRecipes you want to make.
