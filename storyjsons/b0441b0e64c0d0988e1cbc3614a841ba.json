Check out the latest entries right below this letter from our editor.Healthyish friends,Before we were shot into a pandemic-themed pinball machine, before we were careening around in a reality we don\u2019t understand and can\u2019t seem to control, I wanted to make a guide to being single.It was going to be about the joys of eating alone at your favorite restaurant. What to make for dinner on the third date. The best solo vacations we\u2019ve ever taken. It was going to be light-hearted and fun.Then came the pinball machine. Now there are no restaurants to eat at, alone or otherwise. Third dates are postponed indefinitely along with all the other dates. In a lot of ways, a guide to being single has become irrelevant. And yet, as we transition to what everyone keeps calling \u201cthe new normal\u201d (No! I keep thinking. Nothing about this will ever be normal!) I\u2019ve noticed that all of us, single and otherwise, are figuring out how to be alone.I\u2019m fielding overwhelmed texts from friends shacked up with roommates and in-laws. Children are flying across my co-workers\u2019 Zoom screens. A person I went on one date with before all this is in a cabin with his ex in the Adirondacks (true story). And plenty of us are reckoning with true isolation for the first time, our houseplants quickly becoming our closest friends.I\u2019m in that last category, and, in case you were curious, I\u2019ve named my plants after the seven dwarves. (I\u2019m Snow White, obviously.) When I moved into my own apartment a year ago, it was the first time I\u2019d lived alone, no roommates and no partner. I was in the midst of a very different sort of crisis then\u2014it was stressful and sad, and there was some scary health stuff too, but it was personal, not global. It was probably the most challenging period of my life to date, but I never felt alone. I had friends here almost every night, family visiting, soon enough I was dating again. I told everyone how much I loved living by myself in New York, that it was a childhood dream, and it was all true.This time around, the health crisis is everywhere. The stress is everywhere too, and so is the grief. So instead of a guide to being single, this is a month-long series about being alone, and it\u2019s for everyone. Throughout April, we\u2019ll run stories, recipes, and advice that will hopefully help you find some mental solace, whatever your living situation might be. We\u2019re turning everyone\u2019s favorite Healthyish Instagram segment, 30 Seconds With Andy, into an advice column. We\u2019re coming clean about our Secret Single Cooking. We\u2019ll tell you about the pot that every solo cook should have, how to get into the virtual dating game, and what it\u2019s like to be single and pregnant while in isolation.Look, we\u2019ve got a lot of big problems right now. Being alone is maybe not at the top of the list, but, as the days and weeks stretch on, we\u2019re going to get tired of Zoom parties. We\u2019re going to hit cooking ruts. We\u2019re going to stop shaving our legs (me, already). We\u2019re going to see each other through cycles of grief and anger and panic and, yes, joy. Somehow, we\u2019ve got to figure out how to be alone when we\u2019re together and together when we\u2019re alone.I hope you\u2019ll find this series helpful. Over the course of the month, we\u2019ll add new stories to the list below. Email healthyish@condenast.com if there\u2019s something in particular you want to see, and thank you for being with us. We're with you, too.Sincerely,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish EditorThe Healthyish Guide to Being AloneI\u2019m 25 and Taking Care of My Sick Dad.
