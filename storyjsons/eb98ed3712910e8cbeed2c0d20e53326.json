Folded into the ease, however, are deep flavors rightfully attributed to the island\u2019s vast and vibrant East Indian culture, from which this dish is believed to originate. If you can\u2019t find Chief curry powder, madras curry powder is an acceptable substitute (although not an exact one).\u201d Read more about the origins of the recipe here. Serve with Brigid's Citrusy Chicken Thighs, arugula, and brown rice for an easy summer meal.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

(or more) Tabasco or other spicy hot sauceCitrusy Chicken Thighs (for serving)PreparationStep 1Cut top off of 1 medium globe eggplant (about 14 oz.) as close as possible to stem. Using a vegetable peeler, remove skin and discard. Slice eggplant in half lengthwise. Lay halves flat on their cut sides, then slice each half lengthwise into thirds to create long slabs. Cut each slab into large cubes.Step 2Heat 3 Tbsp. vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat about 30 seconds, add 2 tsp. Chief or madras curry powder, and stir to combine. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add eggplant and stir to coat in oil. Pour in \u00bc cup water, stir again, and cover pan. Cook until eggplant is tender but not falling apart, 7\u20139 minutes.Step 3Meanwhile, peel and finely chop 7 garlic cloves.Step 4Uncover pan and pour in another \u00bc cup water. Stir, re-cover, and cook 7 minutes (eggplant should be soft enough to mash easily). Uncover and mash eggplant with a fork. Mix in garlic, 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt, and \u00bc tsp. (or more) Tabasco or other spicy hot sauce and cook, uncovered, until garlic mellows and flavors have come together, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat; taste and season with more salt and hot sauce if needed.Step 5Do ahead: Eggplant can be made 3 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill.How would you rate Trini Stewed Eggplant?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (12)Back to TopTriangleSo easy to cook and sooooo delicious.  Will be making this recipe again and again.  My favorite eggplant dish, I will be cooking eggplant much more now that I have this scrumptious recipe.  Wooo  hooooo!Mary EllenPortland, OR4/26/2021So easy, so good! A perfect comforting veggie base for any protein of choice. I went with baked crispy tofu. I'm not usually a big eggplant fan because of the skin/texture, but I do like baba ghanoush and this texture looked similar in that way. I'll make this again! CJSan Diego, CA3/11/2021Just made this with the citrus chicken thighs.  So easy and delicious!  I didn't have the curry powder that was called for in the recipe (only the S&B \"oriental\" curry powder) but it still came out great.  Like the citrusy chicken, I feel like this recipe is a great foundation to experiment with!BenLos Angeles, CA1/28/2021Delicious. Was nervous about the amount of garlic it called for at first but I was wrong. It taste delicious. This is sure to be a frequent side in my rotation. Best kind of cooking easy cheap and extremely tasty. MikeNew York 1/13/2021Definitely missing something: acid and sweetness, I guess. Going to go add a squeeze of limeAnonymous10/19/2020The curry is strong in this one.Anonymous10/2/2020Amazingly simple and cheap to make. It was hard not to eat it all by myself in one sitting (with no other accoutrement besides some fresh lemon to squeeze on top). I do think 7 cloves of garlic is a little much To use with only one eggplant, even a large one. Next time I\u2019ll use 3-4 cloves. AnonymousSan Diego9/16/2020Love this--so simple and tasty, over rice or with chicken as suggested!Erin AllinghamPortland, Oregon8/6/2020Easy, tastes great. Put it over rice for a great vegetarian meal. Stephanie LammHouston, TX8/4/2020Thanks a lot, I love it.Pitorro1947Puerto Rico. 8/3/2020so no salting eggplant first to pull out liquid??\nKay BrownReno8/2/2020I make this all the time without the curry, I think this should be called curried egg plant.AnonymousTrinidad8/2/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titTrinidadianCaribbeanEggplantVegetableSummerQuickEasySideDairy-FreeGluten-FreeVeganVegetarianBraiseKwanzaaDinnerBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
