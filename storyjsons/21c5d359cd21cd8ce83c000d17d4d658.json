As far as party foods go, they\u2019re a winner: Tostones check off the salty-crunchy category, they\u2019re finger-food-friendly, they\u2019re budget-friendly (four green plantains will yield about 6\u20138 chips per person, plenty if you\u2019re serving another snack or two), and they\u2019re extremely easy to make. Most importantly, they\u2019ll make you look like an incredible host.Now frying might not seem like a great party trick, but there\u2019s a difference with these. There\u2019s no dredge, batter, or coating to deal with\u2014just the plantain coins, the oil, and some salt. Therefore, minimal splatter, zero batter, and very few ingredients. The plantains need only a couple of minutes in the oil total, which will seem like a momentary blip if you\u2019ve ever patiently tended to bone-in pieces of buttermilk-fried chicken. And while the mere \u00bd inch of oil (it's more of a shallow-fry than a deep-fry) should be at 375\u00b0, and I recommend using a digital thermometer to check, you can test without one: If a plantain slice sinks soundlessly to the bottom, the oil isn\u2019t hot enough. If the oil is smoking, it\u2019s too hot. If the plantain joyously bubbles and floats to the top within 10 seconds, you\u2019re good to go.Frying the plantains happens in two stages: During the first fry, the plantain pieces soften so that they\u2019re smashable; during the second fry, they finish cooking through, take on a golden brown color, and get crispy. After the initial fry, squish the plantains. This step has to be done when the plantains are still very warm and pliable, otherwise the flesh will harden right back up. But once you\u2019ve smashed, you can turn off your fry oil, set the chips aside, put away your cutting board, and wait until your first guests arrive. This timeline fits perfectly into my overarching party philosophy: If you actually want to have fun, the key is to do fewer things, and to do as much as you can ahead of time.Smash 'em while they're hot.\nAnd my cilantro dip also helps: After blending chopped cilantro, half a chile, sour cream, fresh lime juice, a splash of water, and some salt, the tangy sauce can be poured into the bowl you want to use for serving and refrigerated for several hours (or covered, for days). Dip: done.Not everyone has a party apron, but if you do, now\u2019s the time to put it on. The second fry is your time to shine. The only thing better than eating freshly-fried tostones is getting to watch someone make them just for you. Everyone at a party wants to feel taken care of, and it\u2019s so easy to do that and make your friends think you are some kind of snack sorceress when you gracefully lift just-fried tostones out of the fryer, shower them with kosher salt, and demonstrate how to dunk. Once they\u2019re re-submerged in the same pot of hot oil, the smashed plantains, need 3 minutes to brown and crisp, and during that time, you are the star.Not pictured: Your party apron.\nWhile saying humble, reassuring things like, \u201cSeriously, anyone can do this!\u201d take a look at the happy people you\u2019ve convened. They\u2019re excited. They\u2019re in awe. They\u2019re optimistic. They\u2019re here for you. Once the tostones hit the platter, it will be their turn on center stage. That\u2019s okay\u2014you proved your point. Hang up your apron and grab yourself a drink. After all, it\u2019s your party.Get the recipe:Tostones With Creamy Green SauceThe double-fried, extra-crispy plantains will never be as good as they are immediately after coming out of the hot oil, but you can hold them in a warm oven if absolutely necessary.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titNew Years EveNew Year's DayRecipes you want to make.
