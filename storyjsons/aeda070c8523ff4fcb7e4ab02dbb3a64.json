Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,This weekend I tasted wine, danced on a rooftop, lounged in multiple parks, and biked my way through this endless summer we\u2019re having in NYC. Then it was Monday, and I was way behind. I hadn\u2019t gone grocery shopping or done my laundry or thought for a second about packing for Portland, where our assistant editor Aliza and I are headed tomorrow for Roux. My Trello to-do lists are crowded with deadlines that I\u2019m not sure I can meet.And yet: I\u2019m happy. Twice this weekend\u2014at the Martha Stoumen wine tasting and in the park\u2014I got asked the same question: \u201cDo you like your job?\u201d And both times the answer came easily, \u201cI love it.\u201d It\u2019s a privilege, and honestly a bit of a miracle, to love your job. I love mine because, on any given day, I might be editing features, planning events, designing merch, testing recipes, scoping out new restaurants and shops, meeting with writers, and working on long-term projects. I often feel more like one of the people in our Entrepreneurs Run the World series than an editor, and most of the time that\u2019s a great thing.We also have a series called Office Crush, and this week\u2019s crush is Katie Rue, who owns Reception Bar on the Lower East Side. Katie\u2019s job is just as all-over-the-place: She spends her days shopping for ingredients at the farmers\u2019 market, going to tea tastings, doing grunt work behind the bar, handling emails, and trying out new recipes. It's further proof that you don\u2019t have to run a start-up to be an entrepreneur.In that spirit, I wanted to introduce a few of my personal office crushes, friends and strangers whose work lives are currently inspiring mine:Rachelle Robinett, founder of Supernatural / old soul / solo travelerAnna Polonsky, founder of Polonsky & Friends / personal style iconAlison Roman, columnist / cookbook author / personal dating-life confidantHawa Hassan, founder of Basbaas Foods / lovely to run into at partiesMennlay Aggrey, \u201ccannabis creative\u201d / cookbook author / IG pen palHallie Applebaum, founder of Future of Women / one of the most #doingthings people I knowAshtin Berry, hospitality activist / host of Conversations With and About White Women on IG LiveBrittny Abad, tattoo artist / person I\u2019m low-key stalking for my next tattooTell me about your office crushes and why you love them: healthyish@condenast.comUntil next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish EditorP.S.
