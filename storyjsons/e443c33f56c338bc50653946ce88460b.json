American actor, Jeff Goldblum.Photo by Phil Knott/Camera Press/ReduxFacebookTwitterEmailJeff Goldblum knows his sushi. \u201cI remember when the very strict Mr. Nozawa of Nozawa was up in Studio City, Los Angeles and I visited there,\u201d Goldblum says. \u201cHe was the first one who told me no soy sauce, and don\u2019t ask for a California roll or anything like that, because we\u2019re gonna kick you out of here.\u201d What Mr. Nozawa probably doesn\u2019t know is that Goldblum likes to follow his sushi dinner with frozen yogurt\u2014a high/low situation we can totally get behind.Read on to find out what the actor is eating when he\u2019s not dining out, his very strong feelings about coffee, and how he loves to nap.What did you have for breakfast today?I was feeling a bit peaked this morning. I traveled to Toronto recently, and I was in the Berlin Film Festival premiering this Isle of Dogs movie, so there was a time change. I had to stabilize myself with very austere oatmeal, which I love to make. And I liked it today even more.How do you take your oatmeal?I add a little goat\u2019s milk. My wife, who is French, has found the best butter in Los Angeles, actually through my friend Jonathan Gold. So I like to put a little of that in.Is it in a gold wrapper? Bigger than a hockey puck?Yeah, you know the exact one.\u201d[Editor\u2019s note: It\u2019s Rodolphe le Meunier Beurre de Baratte.]The butter even looks fancy.\nPhoto by Danny KimAlso, I don\u2019t think people typically have goat\u2019s milk in their fridge.I think I\u2019ve tried every kind of milk. But the kids have been drinking goat\u2019s milk these last couple of years, so that\u2019s all we have there. And I like it.What about coffee or tea in the morning?Well, that brings up an interesting issue. For one reason or another, I gave them both up, and I\u2019m so very happy right now. It\u2019s personal. Even my trainer said, \u201cThree cups a day is good before you work out.\u201d But for me right now, I\u2019m just much happier with a good night\u2019s sleep and some nutrition.You strike me as a type of guy that doesn\u2019t need a lot of energy help.I\u2019m actually lying down on my bed right now. I watched a snippet of you making egg salad about ten minutes ago and I thought, I\u2019m just excited to talk to you. And here I am, spouting nincompoopery.I could talk eggs for a while. How do you like your eggs?Do they call it rustic eggs where you crack the eggs in the pan? You kind of drag them around with a wooden spoon and they become a little white and a little yellow\u2014not all whipped up.That\u2019s how my mother makes her eggs, and that\u2019s how I started making my eggs. The very first food article I wrote for GQ Magazine, probably 13 years ago, was about just this.I can get a little squeamish when they\u2019re less done.Another version of egg salad we love.\nYou, as a man in your mid-60s, are often cited as someone who has got a great head of hair, is in good shape, dresses well. How do you stay so fit?Around age 30, I started to work out, changing my physique a little bit, getting some muscles. I\u2019m nothing if not conscientious and disciplined. So when I took that on, I did it regularly. Now it\u2019s evolved into a regular thing with a little bit of cardio and then a routine with weights. Although given half a chance, I would go outside and play every kind of thing. I like to throw a ball and hit a racket.Nap or meditation?I sort of got into how meditation could be not any kind of particular practice, but a way of being aware and mindful at every moment of your life. Naps are a whole different issue, and I love them.What is your favorite sushi spot in Los Angeles?I adore sushi. I just went last week to Sugarfish. But Sugarfish is the populist version\u2014and delicious version\u2014of Nozawa. I enjoy going to eat sushi with my friend Gary, who\u2019s on the paleo diet except for when he eats with me. And then we go have frozen yogurt down the street, too.Fro-yo? You go in for fro-yo dates?Yes, we do.How do you take your frozen yogurt?I get a medium-sized cup and then I go down the line. I get anything that appeals to me, and it\u2019s different every time. About six or seven flavors usually.What are some favorites?I hit the handle for a second and go to the payment area with a bunch of little dabs. It looks like a Van Gogh painting of some kind. I don\u2019t put any of the toppings on. Then I spoon it and I go, \u201cYou know, they all taste the same.\u201dThis interview is a condensed version of a conversation on the Bon App\u00e9tit Foodcast.
