They\u2019re practical. They come in designs with FLAMINGOS.By Sarah JampelJuly 1, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie CraigFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.I may have a\u2026how should I say it\u2026small ceramics \u201cproblem.\u201d Let\u2019s just say that I had to buy an additional shelving unit to house all of my second-tier dinnerware when my collection got a little unwieldy. But my loyalty to stacks and stacks of heavy, hand-thrown plates and shallow bowls is tested in the summertime, when I\u2019m eating outside as much as possible and I turn to melamine plates.I love melamine plates for two primary reasons. The first is an intellectual affair: Because melamine plates are lightweight and virtually indestructible, I can quite literally throw a few into a beach bag or park bag or carry-on (why not!) without fear of them chipping or cracking or weighing me down. And because they\u2019re relatively inexpensive, even if one were to get damaged in some sort of freak accident, I wouldn\u2019t be too devastated.These John Derian plates are our creative director Michele Outland's favorite.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigThe second reason I love melamine is a matter of the heart: They come in such fun designs. They\u2019re covered in the sort of bold, busy, and outright loud patterns and colors that my meek self would never commit to for my everyday table settings but can gladly embrace in the season where people wear blindingly white pants and drink neon cocktails. Look at the flamingos!For their practicality and their beauty, melamine plates have replaced disposable ones in situations where I might, in the past, have turned to paper or plastic (shame on me!). Even when I\u2019m not dining (a.k.a. eating) outdoors, I still use my melamine plates when I\u2019m feeling whimsical or hosting a friend (or toddler) who I don\u2019t exactly trust with the nice ceramics. (Just kidding\u2014I\u2019d never do that.)Buy them:Femke Zwaan Bamboo Melamine Dinner Plate, $14 at AnthropologieCamp Melamine Blue Speckle Dessert Plates (set of 6), $50 at Food52F\u00eate Melamine Dinnerware, from $28 at Food52Floral Print Melamine Plates (set of 4), $68 at Food52John Derian Melamine Rose Plates, $9 at John DerianAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
