Make breakfast an occasion by serving these calzones alongside a savory peach and shaved fennel salad, marinated beans with ricotta salata, and torta pasqualina.Ingredients8 servings21-lb. 6-oz. balls of pizza dough, room temperatureAll-purpose flour (for surface)6oz. Fontina cheese, grated (about 2 cups)1cup whole-milk fresh ricotta4oz. nduja8large egg yolks1Tbsp. finely chopped rosemaryExtra-virgin olive oilKosher saltPreparationStep 1Prepare a grill for medium-low heat. Set cast-iron griddle on grill. (Alternatively, heat on stovetop over medium-low. And if you don\u2019t have a cast-iron griddle, use a cast-iron skillet instead and cook in batches.) Cut each piece of dough into quarters for 8 pieces total. Roll out 1 piece of dough to an 8x6\" oval. Spoon a heaping \u00bc cup Fontina over half of dough and form a well in the center. Dab 2 Tbsp. ricotta and 1 Tbsp. nduja over Fontina, leaving well empty; slip a yolk into the well. Sprinkle with a bit of rosemary and drizzle with oil; season with salt. Moisten edges of dough with water, fold empty side of dough over filling and press together edges to seal. Brush with oil; sprinkle with salt. Repeat with remaining ingredients to make 7 more calzones.Step 2Place calzones, oiled side down, on griddle and cook until deeply browned, pressing gently with a spatula to create contact with griddle, about 5 minutes. Brush oil on the other sides and sprinkle with salt; turn calzones over. Cook until other sides are deeply browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let sit 1 minute before cutting in half.How would you rate Breakfast Calzones?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkExplore Bon App\u00e9titItalianEuropeanSalamiCured MeatMeatRicottaCheeseFontinaNut-FreeFryBreakfastRecipes you want to make.
