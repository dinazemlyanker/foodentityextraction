Done! Yet there are many other fat-plus-acid dressings that are also two ingredients and deliver much more flavor without much more work.This one, Zingy Sour Cream, comes by way of my new book, Big Little Recipes. Just like my Food52 column, every dish\u2014from weeknight dinners, like slurpy soups and saucy pastas, to useful bonuses, like one-ingredient stocks and two-ingredient frostings\u2014has five ingredients or fewer.Big Little Recipes$25 $22 at Amazon$25 at Food52Zingy Sour Cream hinges on one of my favorite techniques\u2014buy one, get one. When you purchase just about anything pickley, like pepperoncini or kimchi or capers or olives, you get the pepperoncini or kimchi or capers or olives, of course. But you also get their brine. Instead of tossing it, treat it like a revved-up vinegar.For your new go-to dressing, start with a jar of pepperoncini and a container of sour cream. Measuring is highly optional: Add a big plop (about \u00bc cup) of sour cream to a bowl, plus a splash (about 2 Tbsp.) of pepperoncini brine, and a spoonful (about 1 Tbsp.) of minced pepperoncini. Stir, taste, adjust if needed (you can add a smidge of salt if you want), and ta-da.If you don\u2019t have sour cream or pepperoncini on hand, there\u2019s still hope. Whole-milk Greek yogurt and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche are willing and able to step in. Same deal with dill pickles, pickled jalape\u00f1os, or even sauerkraut.Much like ranch\u2014but with, ahem, about nine fewer ingredients\u2014this dressing is a happy marriage of richness and tanginess, two opposites attracting like a magnet. It keeps in the fridge for days in an airtight container, where it will be on hand to make a wedge of iceberg or a bunch of kale feel like a million bucks. Juicy tomato and slivered onion? For sure. Chunky cucumbers and buttery avocado? Here for it. But don\u2019t stop at salad. Spoon Zingy Sour Cream over grain bowls, smear it inside sandwiches, or drizzle it on roasted or grilled anything: chicken, zucchini, portobellos, you name it.But honestly, probably, most definitely best of all? Use it as a dunking sauce for leftover pizza, still cold from the fridge.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimplecookingRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
