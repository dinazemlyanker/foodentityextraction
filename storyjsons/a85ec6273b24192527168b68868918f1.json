Love everything about it.  Do have a question though.  When the recipe asks for 4 smashed garlic, does that mean in a garlic press or smash it with the back of your knife? If you smash it with the back of your knife do you remove it once the breadcrumbs have been toasted? Clarification would be great thanks.\nAnonymousBritish Columbia7/3/2020INSANE! Will definitely be making again. That being said, I love myself a good radicchio recipe, so I'm partial, but this is the best one I've had in a long time.astoltzeLos Angeles4/2/2019Super good! I subbed endive given what was available at the grocery store and spread a little dressing and beadrumbs on each leaf, making it a finger food. This dish received the most compliments at an early Thanksgiving gathering. AnonymousHOUSTON 11/19/2018Incredible salad\u2014I mean, it's ranch dressing. I used purple radicchio and chopped it into bite-sized pieces so it's not a fork-and-knife salad, which is pretty in the photo but not realistic in My Life. And damn, Chris Morocco, those scallion breadcrumbs! Genius!! I ate them with my hands from the bottom of the salad bowl after dinner. alexbeggsBA.com 11/19/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladAmericanRadicchioChicoryLeafy GreensVegetableGarlicFallWinterSideNut-FreeHealthyishThanksgivingDinnerRecipes you want to make.
