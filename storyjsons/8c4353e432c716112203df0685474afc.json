And this year, for the first time ever, the chef-curated menu will be 100% plant-based.By Karen YuanAugust 3, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Corey TenoldFacebookTwitterEmailMarcus Samuelsson had a challenge: For the Met Gala, Anna Wintour had asked him and his team to bring in talented chefs who also had unique stories to tell. Go for people who have an untold story, he remembered her saying.It was a big task. This year, for the first time ever, the Met Gala will feature a menu with recipes by specially selected chefs. And that\u2019s not all: The menu will be entirely plant-based.The move marks a major change for the September event, which has only offered catered meals in the past. The ten New York-based chefs were chosen by chef and restaurateur (and Bon App\u00e9tit brand adviser) Samuelsson as part of a goal to celebrate the city flourishing again after a very difficult year. \u201cWe want to tell the world that we\u2019re back\u2014New York City as a place to gather and celebrate is back,\u201d he told Bon App\u00e9tit in an exclusive interview. \u201cWe\u2019re telling both New Yorkers and outsiders that New York is open for business.\u201dFariyal Abdullahi, Nasim Alikhani, Emma Bengtsson, Lazarus Lynch, Junghyun Park, Erik Ramirez, Thomas Raquel, Sophia Roe, Simone Tong, and Fabian von Hauske will each contribute a recipe that reflects their unique take on American cuisine. The lineup includes restaurant owners, Bon App\u00e9tit Hot 10 alumni, food activists, cookbook authors, and TV personalities, expanding the definition of what it means to be a New York\u2014and an American\u2014chef. \u201cThey represent what the food scene in New York today looks like,\u201d says Samuelsson,\u201dwhat the next generation of food looks like, tastes like, where it lives.\u201dThe theme of this year's Met Gala is In America: A Lexicon of Fashion, the first of a two-part exhibit in fall and spring exploring modern American styles as well as associations with issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion. And the decision to feature an entirely plant-based menu was, well, based on modern American appetites. Fine dining restaurants across the country are exploring plant-based menus, most notably NYC\u2019s Eleven Madison Park, reflecting a shift in visions within the industry and palates among diners. \u201cWe thought it was important to really talk about what\u2019s present, what\u2019s happening\u2014how food is changing in America,\u201d Samuelsson says. \u201cWe want to be the future of American food, of plant-based food. That conversation is happening now.\u201dIn the weeks leading up to the event, Vogue and Instagram are sharing Reels of the chefs creating summer-y recipes, such as a watermelon salad, roasted potato skins, and a tuna-less Ni\u00e7oise salad. They\u2019ll be different from what will be served at the Met Gala, but plant-based as well.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.For Samuelsson, bringing the plant-based conversation to a fashion event felt natural. \u201cBoth industries respect craftsmanship,\u201d he explains. \u201cBeing a chef is all about working a lot with style, with people. It\u2019s the same thing with fashion. It\u2019s a different medium, but you\u2019re really expressing a point of view, a sense of place.\u201d As far as eating flora, much of the fashion industry utilizes natural materials as well, he points out. Both industries are exploring their relationship with nature and the environment. And with each other: Take Gucci\u2019s partnerships with Massimo Bottura in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, or Louis Vuitton\u2019s new restaurant Sugalabo V in its Osaka store.Samuelsson hopes that the Met Gala\u2019s food, as much as the outfits, will spark a conversation. He feels ambitious about the future of food at the event. \u201cI\u2019m excited about hopefully starting a tradition where, next spring, the audience will come for the food as well.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titLifestyleCultureRecipes you want to make.
