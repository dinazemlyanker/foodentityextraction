The Noma group has converted the old Noma space into a restaurant and bar serving dishes inspired by the \u201cbeer belt,\u201d meaning the North Sea region, to go along with a super-geeky indie beer list.ORDER THE: pork schnitzel; hot-smoked mackerel; frikadeller (Danish meatballs); ribs for two; bone marrow; and pretty perfect waffles during weekend lunch. Even if you\u2019re not up on your sours versus your lambics, you\u2019ll enjoy the masterful food, which only pretends to be casual. (We doubt the Germans make their free-range pork schnitzel with anchovies.) If you can splurge, the four-course tasting menu with beer pairings is quite epic. Or just sit by the water and order from the 20-tap selection, which changes weekly. Whatever you do, don\u2019t skip the bread.THE VIBE IS: sophisticated, international will-travel-for-food (and beer) crowd of all ages in the sleek wood-beamed main dining room. The 30-seat lounge area feels a little more just-wandered-in touristy, and you don\u2019t have to make a reservation and you can get the full menu.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open for dinner every day, from 5 p.m. to midnight (the kitchen closes at 9:30 p.m., though) and lunch Friday to Sunday, from noon to 2 p.m.\u2014Christine MuhlkePhoto by Ditte IsagerWE ALSO LOVE108Noma\u2019s more casual spin-off in Christianshavn, with kombucha-shellacked pastriesBRUSHydrate, sort of, with 33 constantly changing taps from this N\u00f8rrebro suds stopRestaurant Sch\u00f8nnemannGet the OG Copenhagen experience at this Indre By *sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d* destinationExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
