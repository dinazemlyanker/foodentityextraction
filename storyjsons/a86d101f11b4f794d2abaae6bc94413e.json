There\u2019s a general store, a weekly farmers\u2019 market, and maybe a decent butcher and fishmonger, but there\u2019s no Whole Foods, no Trader Joe\u2019s, and definitely no Instacart. You\u2019ll eat out a couple of times, but mostly you came to sleep in, hang out, cook meals together, swim/hike/bike, and take at least one nap a day. Here\u2019s the kitchen tools to bring from home, how to shop like a local upon arrival, and the recipes that let you get the most out of summer. Consider it your guide to culinary survival in the not-quite-wilderness.A big plastic storage bin makes for compact transportation.\nPhoto by Alex LauPack the EssentialsDull rental-kitchen knives, cheap cookware, and musty spices can derail the best-laid vacation meal plans. Think of this checklist as your insurance policy, and bring the key equipment, kitchen tools, and pantry staples from home that will make cooking enjoyable when you\u2019re away. Pack up everything between a big plastic storage bin and a tote that can double as a market bag.EquipmentCast-iron skilletNonstick skilletTwo rimmed baking sheetsBlenderCutting boardAirtight deli containersKitchen ToolsKnivesWooden spoonsThin metal spatulaSlotted spoonWhiskPepper millCitrus juicerFine-mesh sieveMicroplane zesterDigital thermometerPair of tongsWine keyCan openerDish towelsPantryYour top five jarred spicesOlive oil from your countertopAny nuts, grains and/or pasta, and oats you\u2019ve gotCoffeeFlaky sea saltThree is the magic number.\nPhoto by Alex LauYes, You Want Your Own KnivesThese are the key three you want:Utility knife: for all your slicing, dicing, chopping, and general prep workParing knife: for all the tomatoes and strawberries that need coring, trimming string beans, and cutting salamiSerrated knife: for crusty bread and bursting-ripe cherry tomatoesAnd no, don\u2019t wrap them in a dish towel secured by a rubber band. There\u2019s a safer way: Pick up a few inexpensive blade covers, slide them onto your knives, and pack everything in a sturdy canvas pouch.Blueberry-lime-cashew smoothies are the perfect breakfast to whip up in your blender.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Chris MoroccoNo, Really\u2014Bring the BlenderWhen you\u2019re trying to make the most of your mornings, keep breakfast quick but filling with frothy fruit-and-nut-filled smoothies for everyone.

Round out things with bread and cheese and you\u2019ll be freed up to throw together casual dishes, such as a giant salad or on-the-fly frittata, with little to no planning required. Come midday, when it\u2019s hot and no one feels like cooking, opt for the lazy lunch: Whip up a garlicky aioli and serve it with a produce-heavy platter starring your market haul. Graze all afternoon. Nap. Repeat.Plan on serving about half a pound of veg and two to three ounces of protein per person.

Meal plans save friendships and marriages. Create a shared Google doc and get pairs to sign up for dinner and clean-up duty. Do this for every night you\u2019re planning to eat in. Seriously.Fried fish sandwiches can (and should) be made on the grill.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Chris MoroccoUse the Grill (but Not for Grilling)When the sun goes down and the evening breezes kick up, take the kitchen outside for a full-on fish fry. Set up your cutting board on the deck table, enlist housemates to pitch in with prep and stocking the cooler with drinks, and treat the (probably propane) grill as the heat source for these insanely satisfying fish sandwiches (or fritto misto or fried chicken). The open air comes with advantages: Gas grills can be dialed into a steady temperature for frying, there won\u2019t be oil splatters on the cabinets or lingering fish aromas, and you\u2019ll fall even more in love with your cast-iron skillet.Get the Recipe: Fried Fish Sandwiches with Cucumbers and Tartar SauceDon\u2019t Make PieDid we tell you to bring a rolling pin and a pie plate? No, we didn\u2019t. Eat ice cream for dessert. Go to the cute little local shop for it, get it from the snack bar, or pick up pints and eat it at home. End the night on a sweet note while someone else does the dishes.Here\u2019s some smoothie inspiration:All products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
