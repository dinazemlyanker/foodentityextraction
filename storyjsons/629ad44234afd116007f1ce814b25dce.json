Plus, there\u2019s just no better way to cook a thick steak\u2014it\u2019s the only way to get the high heat you need without setting off the fire alarm. A perfectly marbled rib eye doesn\u2019t need much to shine, but basting it with jarred crab paste adds a whole new level of flavor with almost no effort. Crab paste tastes like a cross between my two favorite Filipino condiments\u2014bagoong, a fermented fish paste, and crab \u201cfat,\u201d a mixture of the crustacean\u2019s guts and roe\u2014and lends a pleasant intensity to an already-gorgeous cut. \u2014Silver Cousler, Neng\u2019s Jr., Asheville, NCThis recipe is part of Short Is Sweet, our collection of summer dishes that deliver a whole lot of deliciousness in 30 minutes or less.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.
