And then grab lunch after.By Michelle RuizMay 21, 2018FacebookTwitterEmail201404 desk lunch *** Local Caption ***Michael Graydon & Nikole HerriottFacebookTwitterEmailI am standing in Sweetgreen on New York\u2019s Upper West Side, ordering my go-to, the Fish Taco bowl, from a smiling staffer in a \u201cBeets Don\u2019t Kale My Vibe\u201d t-shirt. The usually-packed salad chainlet is eerily quiet\u2014I imagine a tumbleweed made of bean sprouts rolling by\u2014and there isn\u2019t another customer in sight.This is probably because it\u2019s 10:45 a.m.Some people might call this late breakfast, but around this time every day, my roaring stomach begins to demand lunch. It\u2019s a struggle to make it to 12 p.m. before I\u2019m fiending for a salad or a grilled chicken wrap, even though I never skip breakfast and generally get enough sleep (fatigue can spark hunger as a form of fuel). The prospect of 1 p.m. work lunches fills me with palpable dread, because I know I\u2019ll be ravenous by the time we actually eat. \u201c12:30?\u201d I often counter with a smile emoji. At 36, I\u2019m evidently ready for the geriatric dining schedule of the Boca Raton retirement set.\u201cIf I am ever invited to brunch with a call time after 11 a.m., it\u2019s safe to assume I have already eaten and have mentally designated this as a lunch in brunch\u2019s clothing,\u201d a supportive friend confided.We call it lunch al desko. It\u2019s a thing.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Styling by Sue LiAs 5 p.m. is to cocktails, noon is to lunch: It\u2019s widely considered the earliest socially acceptable time to grab a slice of pizza or a sushi special, especially in traditional office environments. \u201cI\u2019m regularly hungry at 11 but feel too ashamed to leave the office so early for lunch,\u201d an editor friend told me. Those brave souls who do venture out before 12 return to their cubes at their own risk. The sight of a Chipotle burrito when the clock still reads a.m. might inspire curious glances at best or outright mockery at worst.It\u2019s a daily struggle and, sometimes, a source of anxiety. Starving for lunch on many a morning, I\u2019ve wondered if there was something wrong with my health (thankfully, blood tests at my annual physical confirmed there is not). On the contrary, according to registered dietician Brigitte Zeitlin, owner of BZ Nutrition in New York, it\u2019s perfectly natural for some people to be hungry for lunch at 11 a.m., especially if they eat breakfast early, too.\u201cThe truth is your body is trained to feel hungry three to four hours after your last meal. So, if breakfast was at 7 a.m., it\u2019s normal to be hungry at 11 a.m.,\u201d Zeitlin said. \u201cThat\u2019s your body\u2019s way of saying, \u2018Yo, I need some energy.\u2019\u201dIt was just what I, and every other egotistical human being, longs to hear. You\u2019re not weird; the rest of the world is. Or, in this case, early onset lunching isn\u2019t the problem, but the tendency to suppress your body\u2019s natural hunger cycle to accommodate workday norms. One friend who works in finance said she schedules an 11 a.m. call or meeting to distract her from her desire for \u201cearly\u201d lunch. Another said he staves off hunger with a cup of coffee.It\u2019s better, Zeitlin says, to listen to those pangs. If you\u2019re hungry at 11 or 11:30 a.m., you have two choices. \u201cEmbrace the fact that your lunch is going to be earlier in the day. Eat at 11, and then have a mid-day snack at 2 or 3 p.m.,\u201d she suggests. Or, \u201cif everyone at your office gets lunch together at 12:30 p.m., and you want to be part of it, structure in a mid-morning snack at 10:00 a.m., so you\u2019re not starving later.\u201dIf you\u2019re eating breakfast later in the morning and are still starving for geriatric lunch, you may need to assess whether your breakfast is filling enough. And, no, a bowl of cereal and coffee won\u2019t cut it. \u201cOur bodies break down grains like cereal very quickly,\u201d Zeitlin said. \u201cYou\u2019ll get a burst of energy and feel great, but then you\u2019ll crash.\u201dTo sustain you through lunchtime, breakfast needs to have a good source of protein and healthy fat, like eggs, plain yogurt, or nut butter, plus some fiber, like a piece of fruit, spinach in your omelet, or a little bit of avocado with your scrambled eggs. For a mid-day snack, pack something healthy yet ostensibly filling like a handful of almonds or walnuts, Greek yogurt, or, like I do for my 4-year-old daughter, part-skim string cheese.We have many, many ideas about healthy snacking.\nMichael Graydon & Nikole HerriottWhat if you\u2019re already eating a robust breakfast and mid-morning snacking and are still yearning for lunch at 11?Consider that \u201cyou may not really be hungry at all,\u201d Zeitlin says, \u201cyou\u2019re just thirsty,\u201d because our bodies interpret both hunger and thirst in the same way. \u201cThe first thing you need to do when you wake up in the morning is have a glass of water,\u201d she said. No need to skip coffee\u2014she\u2019s not a barbarian\u2014but hit the water first.Above all, it\u2019s time to shift the narrative and usher in a brave, new world where it\u2019s okay to eat lunch when some college students haven\u2019t even woken up yet.\u201cEmbrace your hunger,\u201d Zeitlin said. \u201cWe are meant to eat.\u201dAnd consider the perks of eating before noon. \u201cFor the record, I have lunch at 11:30, and it\u2019s fantastic,\u201d she added. \u201cThere\u2019s no line at Sweetgreen. I get in and out real quick.\u201d My thoughts exactly.As a lone-wolf freelance writer, I\u2019m feeling less and less shame about my premature lunching. Although I miss having live co-workers to chat with, I no longer have to consult anyone or conform to standard lunchtimes. At Zeitlin\u2019s instruction to stay hydrated, I\u2019ve been trying to bring a Klean Kanteen of water in my bag to cut down on a.m. hunger and reaching for that mid-afternoon snack, too, (because the 3 p.m. crash is real). But lunch still siren-calls me around 11:30 a.m., at the latest. Marking peace with eating lunch at the same time as my toddlers and, once upon a time, my grandparents, has been half the battle.A fellow freelance friend agrees. When he worked in an office, he was at war with himself, dying to eat lunch before noon, but waiting on co-workers to join him.\u201cNow that I work from home,\u201d he admits, \u201cI sometimes eat lunch at 11:23.\u201dMichelle Ruiz is a writer in New York, and a contributing editor at Vogue.com.1 / 55ChevronChevronGreens-and-Beans SandwichesView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titLunchScienceLunch al DeskoRecipes you want to make.
