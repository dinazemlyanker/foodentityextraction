Somewhere along the way, he became a global parenting phenomenon.By Bettina MakalintalOctober 29, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailCourtesy Nick ChoFacebookTwitterEmailIn Person of Interest we talk to the people catching our eye right now about what they\u2019re doing, eating, reading, and loving. Next up is Nick Cho, cofounder of Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters and parent behind the beloved TikTok account Your Korean Dad.If you know specialty coffee, you likely know the name Nick Cho. Since he entered the industry 20 years ago, Cho has founded coffee shops, spoken at conferences and college classes, trained plenty of baristas, judged coffee competitions, and started the niche\u2019s first podcast, Portafilter. Since 2011 he and his business partner and wife, Trish Rothgeb, who coined the term \u201cthird wave\u201d coffee, have run San Francisco\u2019s Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters, which boasts two locations and a roastery. That work is why I started following Cho on Twitter and TikTok.But in the spring of 2020, I started seeing Cho all over my feeds as his videos were reposted and referenced even by people who couldn\u2019t tell a V60 from a Chemex. His TikTok\u2014where he\u2019d initially made coffee drinks at home and shared his sneaker collection\u2014turned into a global phenomenon as he became \u201cYour Korean Dad,\u201d now with close to 3 million loyal followers. Your Korean Dad isn\u2019t a persona but a public display of how he is in daily life, says Cho\u2014who has two kids in addition to his many internet ones.A typical Your Korean Dad video starts with Cho introducing himself. \u201cI\u2019m your Korean dad,\u201d he says, patting your head. What follows is, honestly, pretty mundane, like a trip to Walgreens, or the grocery store, or Five Guys. In one video he makes you a coffee while you do your homework, and in another, he drops you off at the airport, waving as you walk away. Far away from my family, I feel comforted by Cho\u2019s videos as I remember the childhood grocery trips and errand runs I took for granted.TikTok contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.The fact that Your Korean Dad videos are directed at you, the unseen viewer, is the point\u2014Cho is talking to you and sharing with you. While grocery shopping, he asks which Babybel color you prefer, black or red, and while visiting the Costco food court for a slice of pizza and a hot dog, he adds that you should eat only as much as you feel like eating. These clips may seem simple, but they represent how food is a powerful act of parental love. Many of Cho\u2019s commenters refer to absent, distant, or deceased parents, suggesting that Your Korean Dad eases the sense of loss. \u201cBest dad ever\u201d is a common refrain. The overwhelming sentiment is that Cho is Dad to all of us.Amid the chaotic energy of the internet, Cho\u2019s videos offer a feeling of genuine support, like you\u2019re being cared for, even if only through a screen. I caught up with Cho over Zoom to talk about his unexpected TikTok success, how fatherhood and food are connected for him, and, to bring it all back to the start, how coffee shops informed his approach to parenting, online and off.This interview has been edited for clarity.I got on TikTok because... I have teenage daughters and they said, \u201cYou should be making TikTok videos.\u201d I've been making videos since I was 14, on VHS tape and things like that. I started making coffee videos on TikTok and I was like, \u201cThat's my day job. It's boring.\u201d I started to be more focused and more intentional.Having run coffee shops for 20 years\u2026 I\u2019ve learned there\u2019s this interesting relationship between what do people want\u2014and what are you giving them? It's always been an interesting idea for me and Trish: Instead of trying to figure out what our coffee philosophy and coffee profile and aesthetic was going to be, what if we started with the question: \u201cWhat do people want when they want coffee?\u201d Not: \u201cWhat are they asking for?\u201d Not: \u201cWhat do they say they want?\u201dWhen I first opened my first coffee shop in 2002\u2026 I remember spending extra energy trying to make my mom an extra good latte. After she left I was reflecting: Why did I make it special for her\u2014like, doesn't everyone deserve that amount of care? Though capitalism and commerce has commodified the gesture, giving someone something to eat or drink really is an act of love at the core.Your Korean Dad came from... realizing that the viewer should be the main character. I\u2019m Korean, I\u2019m a dad, and like a lot of dads, I\u2019m trying to wrap my brain around what being a dad means. But the \u201cyour\u201d is maybe the most important part\u2014that I\u2019m offering myself up to the viewer in that way. When you say you\u2019re so-and-so's dad, you\u2019re subordinate in the narrative.The first Korean Dad video to blow up was\u2026 a trip to Walgreens to get snacks. It was really unexpected, and in fact, to be honest, a little jarring at first. That\u2019s when I was getting duets of kids crying, watching my video. There are a lot of tears involved from the audience when they\u2019re engaging with me.People have emotional relationships with food... especially when it comes to parents. With dads, we\u2019re talking about one person\u2014sometimes two or three\u2014for any individual, so the make-or-break element of that relationship is heartbreaking. Even when the relationship goes well, it can be bittersweet. When it\u2019s a failure or when there\u2019s pain and trauma mixed in, it\u2019s a lot for a person.I think about what healthy really means... in a way that is centering the kid. For me it\u2019s ultimately about what\u2019s healthy psychologically and emotionally, as well as physically. I almost make certain messages incidental: \u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to finish the hot dog,\u201d and then I try to move on. The idea of \u201cfinish your plate\u201d is such a fraught topic, from an individual's relationship to food going all the way to their relationships with family and culture.The mundaneness is the profound part\u2026 for a lot of people. I made a second Walgreens video and it was to go get tampons, with the idea that it was no big deal for a dad. I\u2019m trying to find opportunities to model behavior that\u2019s going to mean something to people and actually make a statement, even if it\u2019s a little bit more covert than overt.Managing young 20-somethings in coffee shops\u2026 has helped me sharpen my parenting style. I think I\u2019m a good dad; my kids seem to think so. We don\u2019t have the kind of bickering relationship that some kids have with their parents. They\u2019re never like, \u201cI hate you.\u201d We\u2019ve never had a fight. Sometimes it\u2019s creepily too perfect.My number-one job as a parent, and, for that matter, as a manager is... to always build trust and to never break trust. Once you break it, you can\u2019t really put it back together the same way. But that can also get you almost like a turtle in a shell: afraid to do anything in case you mess up. There\u2019s this meekness and this hesitancy that comes with that, and I know that\u2019s not being a good dad. One of the things that I want to be able to do is challenge people, but in a way they\u2019re totally capable of being challenged.Explore Bon App\u00e9titPerson of InterestLifestyleRecipes you want to make.
