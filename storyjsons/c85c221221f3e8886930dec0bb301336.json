It was placed there moments earlier by one of the restaurant\u2019s somber-faced chefs, the canvas for a fat coin of raw scallop blanketed in citrus-inflected yuzu foam. A single strand of translucent sea grape algae rests atop the whole thing, glistening like a jewel bracelet. Wigser tips the nigiri into his mouth with the ease of someone who clearly does this often, and I follow suit. A hush falls over our corner of the restaurant as we consider the buttery scallops, the tart hit of aromatic yuzu, the sweet smack of sea. We share a slow nod of closed-eye approval, then swallow.The meal at the dramatically lit, glass-enclosed sushi restaurant in the West Village constitutes Wigser\u2019s third omakase in 30 days. Wigser, a real estate investment banker, was first introduced to luxurious, multicourse sushi dinners in the 1980s while entertaining clients from Mitsubishi Group. The predilection stuck.Today he counts himself among a group of diners obsessed with New York\u2019s most exclusive sushi dens, where the price of a single dinner for two amounts to what some New Yorkers pay monthly in rent.\u201cTo be very candid, a typical dinner, when you throw in sake, it\u2019s going to be $800 to $1,000 for two people,\u201d Wigser tells me. At $155 a head, Kosaka is a relative steal\u2014it\u2019s Wigser\u2019s \u201clocal,\u201d and he comes here at least once a month\u2014and it represents only a fraction of his monthly sushi budget. The next course, lightly torched lobes of tangerine uni from Santa Barbara, California, touches down. Wigser snaps a photo and tosses it back. He\u2019ll later upload the image to Instagram. \u201cWhen we\u2019ve been really bad,\u201d Wigser says of him and his wife, \u201cwe go three times a week.\u201dNew York City\u2019s high-end sushi scene has been growing steadily for more than a decade but seemingly never so much as in the past several years. Within the sushi genre, omakase\u2014a style of sushi chef\u2013guided tasting menu\u2014has emerged with particular vigor. To name a few recent openings: Sushi Nakazawa debuted from Sukiyabashi Jiro apprentice Daisuke Nakazawa in 2013; the inventive Shuko came to the fold in 2014; O Ya and Sushi Zo, imports from Boston and L.A. respectively, opened Manhattan outposts in 2015; Sushi on Jones, which set the bar for budget options ($58 for a 12-piece, 30-minute tasting) arrived in 2016; subterranean Omakase Room by Tatsu, elegant Sushi Amane, and more affordable Sushi Ishikawa, entered the scene in 2017; ultra-pricey Sushi Noz opened its eight-seat sushi bar for business in 2018.\u201cIt seems to me that Japan\u2014and Tokyo specifically\u2014replaced Paris as the great food obsession for New Yorkers a long time ago,\u201d New York Magazine restaurant critic Adam Platt told me. Platt has written his fair share of reviews and articles about upscale sushi restaurants in the past decade, including the publication\u2019s recent rundown of the absolute best sushi spots in New York City. \u201cIn those sort of high, high finance circles, and certainly among the younger moneyed finance classes, the trophy-style dining is now sushi,\u201d Platt said. \u201cThese places are basically all filled with young guys, sometimes women, sporting their $30,000 watches, who all have \u2018my guy.\u2019\u201dThe connection between the moneyed class and omakase is so strong that it\u2019s become a pop-culture trope, turning up in a 2017 episode of Showtime\u2019s Billions. In the scene, a pair of rowdy bankers cause a stir at Sushi Nakazawa while speaking loudly on a cell phone and dunking their nigiri in soy sauce. The blatant disrespect inspires an impassioned schooling on proper sushi etiquette from Mike \u201cWags\u201d Wagner, the show\u2019s smarmy hedge-fund COO. Billions co-creator Brian Koppelman tells me that the scene was inspired by real-life characters he\u2019s encountered in New York City.\u201cAt a place like Shuko or Nakazawa in New York, most of the people at the sushi bar are there in a great spirit, and then there\u2019ll be a couple of people there who just want to be able to say they ate there,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can usually tell, because they start putting ginger on top of their fish and they\u2019re calling their money manager. You know, someone who treats the corner seat of the sushi bar as though it\u2019s a blackjack table.\u201dDavid Foulquier, the co-owner of the Upper East Side\u2019s Sushi Noz, where omakase starts at $300 a head with a $175 drink-pairing option, knows the real-life characters well.\u201cThere\u2019s a guy who comes and spends $500 on a bottle of champagne and $500 on sake and then buys a round whiskey for everybody,\u201d he says. \u201cThat guy exists and that guy is 100 percent a client, but there are also people who are actually going for what they consider to be a truly extraordinary culinary experience.\u201dOmakase, Foulquier continues, delivers a uniquely personal and therefore more exclusive luxury experience than, say, an equally expensive dinner at the Michelin-three-star Eleven Madison Park. \u201cAs hard as these places try, you cannot personalize a dining experience when there are 200 other people in the room as much as you can with an omakase restaurant.\u201d In some cases, regulars will take advantage of the restaurant\u2019s small size, scheduling weekly standing reservations that claim every chair in a seating. \u201cThey can buy out the restaurant for them and eight of their friends,\u201d Foulquier says. \u201cIt\u2019s this kind of an extra-personal experience where you feel like you own the place.\u201dSocial media plays its own role in the flaunting \u201cgotta catch them all\u201d version of the omakase experience. Wigser says that during his sushi outings, he usually spots at least one diner he recognizes from their Instagram accounts\u2014users like Oh My Kase (18.2K followers), The Sushi Legend (16K followers), and omakase_nyc (39.1K followers).\u201cLately I\u2019ve slowed down, but I could easily do two omakases a month,\u201d says Josh Birns, who\u2019s also in New York real estate. His You Uni Live Once account has 29.1K followers. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing as me buying a ticket to a Broadway show. We\u2019re going for the experience to remember forever. It\u2019s not just a dinner. It\u2019s an event.\u201d\u201cIt is a lot of money,\u201d says Masha Stroganova, an art gallery director who runs the Instagram account omakase_nyc. Stroganova says she indulges in up to three omakases a month with each meal averaging between $150 and $200. \u201cBut I\u2019d never blow the same cash on a high-end French meal. I\u2019ve done it before, and it\u2019s never left me satisfied.\u201d\u201cSushi, it checks all the boxes,\u201d Platt says. \u201cIt requires a fair amount of money to consume. It signifies that you\u2019ve traveled. The world of high finance and money has always been food obsessed.\u201d It\u2019s just that these days, \u201cthey\u2019re not talking about \u2018my last trip to Peter Luger.\u2019\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsNew YorkSushiJapaneseRecipes you want to make.
