Genius! I always get that \u201cwtf\u201d moment they describe. I particularly love it in the cold dark winter time to warm me up and think to brighter days. Hannah LSeattle12/25/2021We definitely had that \u201cwhat the f*@k\u201d moment when we tasted this. These were AMAZING!!! We swapped the pork for beef ribs. Served them on top\nof an adobo cashew pur\u00e9e with the charred and raw corn salad which is also a bon appetite recipe I highly recommend. We will definitely be making these again soon!! tkkellerChicago 5/6/2020I'm not going to over complicate this review: they were delicious.  Can't find Sumac where I live, so I just coated with lemon juice before adding the spice rub.  I used Baby Back Ribs because they were on sale so I reduced the cook time.  Everyone I made them for were very pleased with the final result.  Served with cole slaw which frankly went with the ribs beautifully.RogueRevPA4/23/2020Made these for dinner yesterday and they were a winner. Didn't have cocoa or sumac on-hand for the mole rub so I added lemon pepper, extra coffee and cinnamon to compensate. After reading the comment below about the pan drying out, I used an entire 16-oz bottle of homemade carrot-orange kombucha. Serve with something tangy and green, e.g. a apple brussels sprout slaw. No leftovers. broazayBushwick4/23/2020YUMMY!!  The ribs fell off the bone and the flavors were amazing.   The combination of the spices reminded me of my favorite Mole recipe from Cafe Pasqual.    I loved how the oranges added a sweet surprise.  It would be perfect to strip the bones after cooking and soak in the juices, onions and orange pulp and serve with tortillas, cilantro, avocado and crema.  I used the entire 16 oz bottle of Kombucha so maybe that helped with the sauce; knowing the last person had dry ribs.   Our ribs were really meaty/fatty so I could see the rub becoming overwhelming if you don't have good ribs.  I also covered them when they sat overnight.  I might try this with a pork shoulder next time.  San Luis Obispo1/22/2020We did NOT love this. The ribs were tender, but despite following the instructions to let the rub sit on the ribs overnight uncovered, the flavors didn\u2019t permeate the meat AT ALL.  I think also it needed more liquid as they were extremely dry after 2 1/2 hours at 300. The taste of the spices was overwhelming and not in a good way. I\u2019ll try again, but with far less spice rub, much more liquid, and a fattier piece of pork. I think I will also not let them\nsit so long. \nIn the meantime I\u2019m going to strip the meat from the ribs after removing the rub and try making a mole style sauce to try and salvage all this workTinaHunt4781/15/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titRibsPork RibPorkMeatMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeDinnerRecipes you want to make.
