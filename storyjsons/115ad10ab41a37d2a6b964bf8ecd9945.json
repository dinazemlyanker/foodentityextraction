It\u2019s been a beautiful blur of crispy harissa-smothered chicken thighs, turmeric coconut curry, and roasted salmon with ponzu. And, if our Instagram feed is any indication, we\u2019re not the only ones feeling good. Some people cooking through each day at a time, others are going rogue and making their own lineup. It\u2019s all great\u2014this plan is about finding healthful foods and flavors to cook (and cook, and cook) well after the plan\u2019s two weeks are up. A lot of you have already asked about vegetarian and vegan substitutions, so here's senior food editor Chris Morocco's advice:For big-batch vegetarian protein lunch prep, double the marinated beans, soft boil some eggs, and roast tofu using the tearing technique found in the roasted broccoli and tofu recipe. For a vegetarian version of the Turmeric-Coconut Curry with Pork, add pre-cooked grains for a saucy take on fried rice. Or, swap in crumbled tofu, tempeh, or even roasted sweet potato. If you\u2019re trying to avoid soy products, roasted chickpeas can bulk up lunches and replace tofu in the Roasted Broccoli and Tofu with Creamy Miso Dressing. The dish can also be adapted for a wide range of vegetables. \"I think the main point here is that you want to roast a cruciferous green,\" says Morocco. \"It can be all brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower... I think you just need something that\u2019s really hearty that can take that level of heat and almost char in the oven.\"Saturday's frittata is also perfect for variation. \"You can do zucchini instead of eggplant, but I would just do more cabbage and more onion,\" Morocco says. \"If you have any leftover roasted veg from the previous night or lunch prep, a little bit of the previous nights' roasted sweet potato or roasted broccoli, chop that up and put that in the frittata instead of the eggplant. It's a total pro move.\"Here are some of our favorite takes on the plan so far, sourced from the Healthyish community. And if you\u2019re in need of some extra adaptation guidance, leave us a comment on Instagram or email us at healthyish@condenast.com and we'll do our best to help.1. @Superwowomg used bok choy in place of fennel for her One-Skillet Crispy Chicken Thighs with Harissa, and it looks awesome.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.2.
