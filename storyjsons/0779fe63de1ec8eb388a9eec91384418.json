We asked 80 of the most interesting people we know to reveal the local spots they love the most.From freeway to shining freeway, Houston is a global food city, which (I get it) sounds a little cliche\u2014until you\u2019re actually on the ground, that is. There\u2019s something for everyone, whether you\u2019re craving a big, filling breakfast or a big, filling lunch. If you\u2019re coming to visit me, these are the three spots I\u2019d take you to.Baby Barnaby\u2019sOn weekends there\u2019s no place like Baby Barnaby\u2019s (pictured above) on Fairview. Tucked behind Montrose\u2019s gay bars, it\u2019s a homey breakfast joint that gets dressed up for dinner. Go for the best waffle in the city: They\u2019re plate-size and crispy yet miraculously tender inside. The clientele is as diverse a picture of Houston as you\u2019ll ever see. Or hear. Open your ears and you\u2019ll catch four or five different languages. Whenever I\u2019ve got folks flying into town, this is one of our first stops because the helpings are generous (that\u2019s important in these parts), the buttered biscuits are the softest, and the cooks fry your eggs exactly the way you like them, however you like them, just right, every time.First stop in Houston.\nPhoto by Max BurkhalterLes Givral\u2019s Sandwich & Caf\u00e9Most days my go-to lunch near downtown involves a stellar egg b\u00e1nh m\u00ec from Les Givral\u2019s on Milam Street. The hosts warn me against ordering runny yolks every time, but I do anyway and always end up splattered. It\u2019s a neighborhood staple, cheap eats for the local set, and the sandwiches attract some of the inner loop\u2019s biggest lunch crowds. The baguettes are transcendent. The pork is succulent. They\u2019ve found the perfect algorithm for balancing cilantro and carrots, with just enough spice in the mix to make you wince.La Guadalupana Bakery & Caf\u00e9Houston\u2019s a taco city, and those at La Guadalupana on Dunlavy are no joke. It\u2019s a cozy little family-run joint that shares a slip of a strip mall with a convenience store and a laundromat\u2014drive too fast and you\u2019ll miss it. I\u2019m a devotee of the mole poblano, which boasts a complexity of flavors that deserves its own essay, but the charro-bean-laced tacos al carbon are incredible as well, and smoky. The owner and head chef, Trancito Diaz, will be sure to stop by everyone\u2019s table for a quick what\u2019s-up. The coffee, though\u2014the coffee\u2019s undeniable. It\u2019s so strong that it\u2019d wake the dead, brewed with just the barest hint of cinnamon.Bryan Washington is a writer in Houston.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Explore Bon App\u00e9titNeighborhood RestaurantsHoustonRecipes you want to make.
