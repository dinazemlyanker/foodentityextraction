Richmond)FacebookPinterestTwitterEmailGrant HarderGO HERE: for quality dim sum in Richmond, Vancouver\u2019s easily accessible neighbor known for having the best Chinese food outside of China. Fisherman\u2019s Terrace\u2019s palatial space is located in a mall\u2014as all good Richmond restaurants are\u2014and stays busy from open to close.ORDER THE: shredded chicken cold plate (which you\u2019re right, does not sound inspiring, but you won\u2019t regret this savory-crunchy-pickle-y salad); Chinese doughnut rice rolls; flaky barbecue pork pastries; and deep-fried taro balls. The shrimp with leek dumplings, pan-fried eggplant with shrimp paste, and turnip cakes with preserved meat are also excellent, as is the XO sauce (go ahead and ask for another tiny bowl of it). The menu is very reasonably priced, so don\u2019t hold back.THE VIBE IS: bustling, with the steady hum of clinking dishes, large families conversing, and small cousins chasing each other around the tables.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day, from 10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. for dim sum; and from 5:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. for dinner. Reservations by phone are strongly recommended. In terms of getting there, hop on the SkyTrain (any headed south on the Canada Line to Richmond Brighouse) and exit at Aberdeen Centre. The station is connected directly to the mall where the restaurant is located.\u2014Lindsay AndersonGrant HarderGrant HarderWE ALSO LOVERodney\u2019s Oyster HouseSerious oyster curation in Yaletown, but that\u2019s about where the seriousness endsKishimotoThe Drive\u2019s no-frills standby for impeccable sushiGranville Island Public MarketAll the Canadian food (smoked salmon!) under one roof Explore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
