Vegan ice cream is usually an immediate pass for me. It\u2019s chunky, icy, and dense. But after giving it a try this past summer, I\u2019d go so far as to say that Frankie and Jo\u2019s not only wasn\u2019t terrible\u2014this ice cream changed me!The Capitol Hill shop is small, with minimal d\u00e9cor. That\u2019s okay. You\u2019re here for the frozen stuff. The base incorporates cashews and coconut milk, making the ice cream exceedingly creamy. You can run your spoon right through it, with not an ice granule to be found. There are all sorts of interesting flavors too\u2014brown sugar vanilla, chocolate tahini\u2014but the one you must try is salty caramel ash, a mildly sweet, jet black scoop flavored with burnt vegan caramel, coconut oil, vanilla extract, and sea salt. If you\u2019ve ever had salted caramel flavored anything, this is nothing like that. It\u2019s better. More subtle. You can taste the inherent richness of the base, the intensity of the vanilla, and the slight smokiness of the caramel. And we haven\u2019t even talked about the waffle cone! Made with maple syrup, oat flour, and flax seeds, it is crunchy with just the right amount of bendiness and chew. You\u2019ll want to eat it like a cookie.I visited at least a half dozen ice cream shops during that short trip to Seattle (you\u2019ve got to respect a city where it is cold most of the year, yet there is an ice cream shop on every block). All of them dairy-based, mind you. And yet, after all that, it\u2019s the vegan option that I can\u2019t stop thinking about. Life sure is wild sometimes.Go there: Frankie & Jo\u2019sExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendSeattleIce CreamRead MorerestaurantsThe Hype Ice Cream I\u2019m Willing to Wait in Long, Near-Rioting Lines ForBy Sarah JampelRecipes you want to make.
