Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you\u2019ll get the scoop before everyone else.Dear Healthyish friends,The most exciting news I have to report this week is that I bought a lot of plums the other day and am now having plum paralysis trying to decide what to make with them (debating between jam, the famous Marian Burros torte, or this cake with plum caramel).Other than that, there\u2019s not a whole lot to report around here. As the summer of beverages draws to a close (goodbye, cold brew, hello, chai), I realize I have yet to write about the one warm-weather drink I\u2019m bringing into the fall, winter, and beyond: roasted-barley iced tea.When I was growing up, we always kept a big bag of store bought roasted barley kernels in the pantry. (You can buy these at H-Mart and other well-stocked Asian grocery stores.) My parents would make a giant kettle\u2019s worth of tea by steeping the barley kernels in hot water, straining the resulting brew, then refrigerating pitchers of it for us to drink all week. This nutty, slightly smoky tea is known by various names\u2014boricha in Korean, mugicha in Japanese\u2014and is packed with all the antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals of barley (plus it\u2019s naturally caffeine-free). It\u2019s what we had with dinner instead of water or milk most nights of the week.All it needs is an overnight steep.\u00a0\nCopyright 2020. All rights reserved.As an adult, I hadn\u2019t gotten into the habit of making barley tea for myself until this summer for various reasons: my Brooklyn apartment doesn\u2019t have space for a giant kettle, nor a big pitcher to house in my tiny shared fridge. Also, I\u2019m lazy.Luckily, my friend Sue recently told me about her barley tea workaround as another self-identified lazy person who enjoys cold tea beverages: These little individual sachets, which you drop into a quart of water and refrigerate until it\u2019s cold, fragrant, and deep brown. (I also want to try these from Umami Mart).All summer, I\u2019ve gotten into the habit of making cold barley tea before I go to bed. I add a sachet to a one-quart glass Ball jar that I keep in the door of the fridge at all times, then let it steep overnight so it\u2019s ready for me in the morning. I drink it over ice over the course of the following day, and, when I finish, I top off the jar with more water to get a less potent but still serviceable second steep. Because sometimes...it really is too much work to walk to the pantry to grab another tea bag.Keep it lazy,Christina ChaeyAssociate editorPhoto by Laura MurrayHouse Foods Mugicha Tea$11 at Amazon$7 at Umami MartExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishWhat's Chaey Cooking?Summer DrinksRead MoreLifestyleMake Yourself an Elaborate SandwichBy Christina ChaeyRecipes you want to make.
