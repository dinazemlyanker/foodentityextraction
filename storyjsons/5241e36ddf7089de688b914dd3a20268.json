See our past recommendations here!I ended a recent dinner party with a humble-looking applesauce cake that turned out to be way more delicious than it had any right to be. When my friends quizzed me on the exact ingredients, I was forced to fess up and pass around the jar of cinnamon that was solely responsible for the cake's \"wow\" factor. I ended up dishing out tiny spoons so my friends could taste the cinnamon straight-up. I swear I don\u2019t normally do this, but they had to understand that this cake was built on Burlap & Barrel\u2019s Royal Cinnamon and Burlap & Barrel\u2019s Royal Cinnamon alone.Photo by Emma FishmanBurlap & Barrel Cinnamon$8 at Burlap & Barrel$9 at HiveCompared to any other ground cinnamon, this is powerful stuff. Harvested from an heirloom species (cinnamomum loureiroi) that\u2019s rarely seen outside Vietnam and sun-dried, it smells like Big Red gum and tastes so sweet you\u2019ll swear it\u2019s spiked with sugar. Even when I use half the amount of what\u2019s called for in a recipe (and yes, I\u2019d recommend starting slowly as you gauge its intensity), my pies, snickerdoodles, morning buns, and yes, cakes, turn out brighter and more fragrant than any I\u2019ve baked before. And on days when I\u2019m not baking, it makes my regular banana smoothie or bowl of oatmeal taste like something special.If you love flavor, don't just stop at Burlap & Barrel's cinnamon powder. Every spice they sell is infinitely aromatic.\nPhoto by Emma Fishman, Food Styling by Sue LiAll of Burlap & Barrel\u2019s spices are sourced directly from farms and farm cooperatives, which means better payoffs for producers and fresher, higher-quality spices for me. Because spices start to deteriorate the second they\u2019re ground, a shorter supply-chain\u2014one where the spice company isn\u2019t trading through middlemen\u2014means more potent spices (and less chance of adulteration). While I occasionally experiment with their harder-to-find seasonings, like wild Icelandic kelp and black lime, it\u2019s the everyday spices\u2014smoked paprika, cumin seeds, turmeric, and yes, cinnamon\u2014that have made me realize just how musty my old stash had been. My dinners sing louder and clearer than ever before.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish Loves ItShoppingRead MoreLifestyleIn a House of Picky Eaters, These Jarred Sauces Are Always a WinBy Chris MoroccoRecipes you want to make.
