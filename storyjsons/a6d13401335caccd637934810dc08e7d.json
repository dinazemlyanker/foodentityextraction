Duh. The line-up constantly changes, based on owner Stefen Ramirez\u2019s recent travels, so you might get fragrant yet mellow oolong from Taiwan one day and the next month a smokier oolong sourced from the Wuyi Mountains in southeastern China. While the carefully curated teas are the draw, it\u2019d be such a shame to miss out on the boozy options, like matcha you can pair with sparkling wine or Echigo beer or infused Tokki soju. While the abbreviated food menu can be a little all over the place, the ochazuke is on point: it's made of soy-and-wasabi-cured fish, vegetables, and ume, all piled on rice. Mix it altogether with hojicha tea for a complex and comforting soup that beats out any chicken noodle.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open everyday: Monday to Saturday, from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., and Sunday, from noon to 6 p.m.\u2014Elyse InamineYunji KoYunji KoWE ALSO LOVEBuvetteTr\u00e8s West Village, with hints of ParisT\u00e9 CompanyA tearoom with a one-of-a-kind tasting menuWildairThis Lower East Side natural wine bar delivers some of New York\u2019s best foodExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
