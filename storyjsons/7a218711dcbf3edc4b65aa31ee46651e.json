Full disclosure: The idea stemmed less from the munchies than frustration. I end up hosting large weekend breakfasts at my apartment with frequency, and bagels and cream cheese, plus some version of eggs, always ends up being the begrudging default. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if I could just get it all done in one? Wouldn\u2019t it be better to do something a little less phoned-in, a little more impressive? I imagined the recipe would be all the things I love about the classic bagel sandwich\u2014salty and savory; crunchy and creamy, warm and cold\u2014but make it quiche.Gracious, indomitable senior food editor Molly Baz was on board to bring my vision to life.It started with the crust. The everything bagel\u2013ness really had to hit home here. It needed to be substantial enough to hold up to the eggs and seedy enough to compensate for the surface area you get from a whole bagel. So she went with a traditional pie dough, working in a \u2153 cup mix of poppy seeds, sesame seeds, dried garlic and onion, and salt. (TJ\u2019s sells something similar if you don\u2019t have these in your pantry). She first tried it in a cake pan to make the quiche tower impressively, but the crust to custard ratio wasn\u2019t right. So she went one step shallower and opted for a deep dish pie plate to ace the balance.Squint, and it looks just like the quintessential bagel sandwich.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesThen it was onto the eggs. The filling needed to simulate that neutral, clean cream cheese feeling, while remaining texturally rich and silky. So she pulled out all the dairy from the walk-in fridge and tried her custard with cream cheese, half and half, sour cream, heavy cream, and finally a mix of heavy and sour creams. The highest in fat, the creamiest in texture, and the best in brightness and tang, she found her winner. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect nod to cream cheese, without being actual cheese,\u201d she said. Then Molly added raw scallions to the filling, because this is all about being extra.Last came the accoutrement: the classic combo of onion, capers, dill, and lemon that make this New York staple fully loaded. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s a salad waiting to happen,\u201d she said. So Molly tossed them all together, arranged a handful of it on top of the warm, fresh-baked quiche, and served the salmon (optional) right alongside.When I finally got to see it in its final form, it was absolutely nothing like I had imagined. It was taller than I had pictured. And greener. Where was the thick slather of cold, white cheese? Why weren\u2019t there seeds everywhere? How could this match up to everything I\u2019d dreamed of? Then I tasted it\u2014and freaked the f#@* out. There it was: All the promise of salty, savory, crunchy, creamy, warm, and cold in one creation, and in one bite. Molly had done it. Of course, now it means I\u2019ll never be able to look at breakfast at my place the same way again. I\u2019m really looking forward to it.Get the recipe:Fully Loaded Everything Bagel QuicheThere isn\u2019t anything more perfect than a fully loaded everything bagel for breakfast\u2014and now you can eat it in quiche form.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBreakfastBrunchWeekendWeekend BrunchQuicheRecipes you want to make.
