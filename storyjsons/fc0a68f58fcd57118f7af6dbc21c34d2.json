Save your astonishment: All it takes is boiling water and six and half minutes. Yup, that\u2019s the magical number for an egg with a completely cooked white and a firm but gooey yolk that you can add to any bowl of ramen, salad, flatbread\u2014or eat on its own with a dollop of spicy mayo and relish.Notably, you don\u2019t have to wait for the eggs to come to room temperature before cooking them in this jammy egg recipe. You can take them out of the fridge and lower them (carefully!) straight into the pot as soon as the water begins to simmer. Just remember: The eggs will continue to cook once removed from the water if you don\u2019t cool them immediately in a bath of cold (preferably ice) water. This will also make them easier to peel and eat because they won\u2019t be piping hot. See? Easy!Editor\u2019s note: This recipe was originally published on March 21, 2017.Ingredients4\u20138 servings4\u20138large eggsPreparationStep 1Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil over medium-high heat.

For a jammy egg that can be eaated chilled, I will try the 7 minute cooking time.  I also found the egg a little hard to peel so will add the salt and vinegar next time.PattieCamas, Washington3/13/2022Used them in Ramen recipe.  They maintained their \"jaminess\" beautifully. DaveyG West Hartford CT 1/6/2022This was my first time cooking the eggs at a boil for the duration. I followed the directions perfectly and wound up with very soft boiled eggs with a slightly runny white also, which I am not a fan of. Maybe 7 minutes would work better like some commenters said, but the recipe as is didn't do turn out right. DezCA12/30/20217 minutes was PERFECT. Easy to peel and best jammy eggs I\u2019ve ever made. AbbeyCleveland, OH12/23/2021Delish\u2026but I\u2019m gonna try Sofia\u2019s tip from 7/23/21 next time\u2026peeling was a disaster and I hate seeing egg whites come off on the shell \ud83d\ude21MindiLos Angeles, CA11/4/2021So good, reminds me of a poached egg only easier to cook and store\ud83d\ude0aAnonymousCentral PA10/7/2021This is a great recipe. Remember that elevation will play with your times. I personally suggest doing a test egg and then adjusting the time. I like my yolks really runny but the whites are solid, 10 seconds too little or too long can make all the difference between a perfect egg or one that is either too jammy or slightly undercooked whites.DeanLewis County, WA8/28/2021So perfect, I did 7 min and. Next time I would do 6.5 just to make them a little more runny.  These were so nice!\nDeblovesfoodPortland 8/4/20216.5 minutes wasn't quite enough for me, but 7 was perfect.  A tip: add a bit of salt and vinegar to the water to make for easier peeling!SofiaWashington, D.C.7/23/2021Absolutely perfect! Thank you, I can\u2019t wait to make them again. TheresaHouston7/20/2021These come out just right...I came across this in Richard Olney's \" Simple French Food,\" btw, long ago. Makes great egg salad on crusty bread brushed with garlic. Mmmn.kgwLong Beach, CA7/15/2021Since my eggs were coming out straight out of the fridge, I followed the suggestion of boiling for 7 min. They turned out perfect!!BubgummyTennessee7/8/2021The simple method taught to me by my French-Belgian grandmother skips the ice bath, extra bowl, and peeling underwater, etc. Just put the eggs in a small pan, cover with water, turn heat to high. The moment it hits a real boil, immediately cover and remove from heat. Set a timer for 14 minutes for hard-boiled, 12 minutes for softer. When the timer goes off, drain the hot water, cover with cold water and gently swirl the water for about 30 seconds, then remove eggs from the water. The  retained heat cooks the eggs perfectly whether straight from the refrigerator or at room temperature. Boiling the eggs for any amount of time can easily overcook the eggs or risk green-rimmed yolks. TheresaOakland, CA4/12/2021This is to the \"Anonymous\" know-it-all who stated it's just a soft boiled egg, not rocket science, you obviously don't know your cooking terms.  The whole reason for this recipe is that the difference between heat and 30 seconds can change this from being too underdone to God forbid, hard-boiled.  \n\nThat being said, this has a lot to do with your stove, how much water and eggs you are cooking.  I found rapidly boiling water for 7 minutes works to my liking.  Faith AngeliLos Angeles, CA3/19/2021Worked perfectly for me. Took the eggs straight out of the fridge, boiled my water, then put the eggs to boil for 6.5 mins and iced for 2. Super easy straight forward. Eggs came out exact as described. Was jammy texture and not runny like a soft boiled.
