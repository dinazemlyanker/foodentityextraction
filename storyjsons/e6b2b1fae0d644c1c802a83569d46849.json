Then Michelle Fire made it the place everyone went to drink, to dance, to hook up in a dark corner, to feed cake to strangers on the dance floor.By David TamarkinJune 6, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Wes FrazerFacebookTwitterEmailThis is part of our series that celebrates America\u2019s Favorite Neighborhood Restaurants. We asked 80 of the most interesting people we know to reveal the local spots they love the most.It took a few years for Big Chicks to become Big Chicks. First, Michelle Fire had to tend to the old men.They were World War II vets, transplants from Appalachia, retirees who lived in the SRO next door. Fire inherited them when she bought the bar in 1986; they\u2019d been drinking there, tucked away in this dark watering hole in the Uptown neighborhood of Chicago\u2019s Far North Side, since 1944.\u201cThere was a cane on every bar stool,\u201d Fire tells me now.She couldn\u2019t kick them out. Or rather, she wouldn\u2019t. She served them drinks and slowly made renovations around them. Technically, these old guys were sitting in a gay bar now, but they didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t care. They arrived at 7 a.m., drank all day, put their chihuahuas on the bar and let them lap from whiskey glasses, just like they always did. Fire, who previously bartended at a late-night gay bar called the Loading Dock, had never seen anything like it.On Sundays she cooked. She\u2019d grill chicken or make pasta\u2014\u201cgood food, not junk food,\u201d she says to me\u2014and hand out plates. No charge. She wanted to thank the old guys\u2014hell, the gay guys weren\u2019t exactly knocking down the door\u2014and, besides, they looked like they could use a meal. A lot of them lived alone, didn\u2019t cook. \u201cThese guys were not well-heeled,\u201d she says.Michelle Fire, leader of the Big Chicks flock.\nPhoto by Matt HaasIt went on like this for years. Two and a half years of renovations to make the place presentable. Four years, five years, until the sexy gay boys finally showed up.Was it a coincidence that things started to change the minute she put a piece of art on the walls? Eventually Fire would turn Big Chicks into a gallery, covering every inch of the place with paintings and photographs, all of them depicting women, and many of them by artists who had perhaps never been hung in a smoky old-man\u2019s bar: Lee Friedlander, Diane Arbus, Lisette Model. She started with a giant mural of three women\u2014\u201cthe muses,\u201d in Fire-speak\u2014and hung it above a table near the front door. As soon as it appeared, there was a shift. A lot of the SRO guys weren\u2019t around anymore. Some of them had been banned for bad behavior; a lot of them had died. For a moment Big Chicks looked like it had lost the only client base it had. But one snowy night, one of Fire\u2019s bartenders, Don, looked out the window. A bunch of queens were exiting a taxi, looking around, wondering why the hell they were in Uptown. They skittled into Big Chicks. Another cab followed; same thing.Don called Fire over. \u201cI think we have a gay bar,\u201d he said.The three muses, Fire\u2019s first piece of art for Big Chicks.\nPhoto by Matt Haas\u201cI\u2019ve been that boy leaning against the wall.\u201dWell, they did and they didn\u2019t. Big Chicks never fit neatly into the gay bar mold. Maybe a bar run by a woman who self-identifies as being of \u201cindeterminate sexual proclivities\u201d\u2014a bar named Big Chicks, for Christ\u2019s sake\u2014never had a chance of being a typical gay bar.Not that typical was the goal. Fire had a tagline for the place from the beginning: men and men, women and women, and women and men. In other words, she welcomed everybody. And that\u2019s what she got. The leather daddies, the truck-driving lesbians, the genderqueers, the femmes; black, latino, Polish, Japanese. They all showed up.Dance the night away.\nPhoto by Wes Frazer\u201cDid you ever know the girth-and-mirth people?\u201d Fire asks me.I\u2019d never heard of them.\u201cChubby chasers,\u201d she says. They were at Big Chicks too. They, like everyone, were there for Fire.\u201cI\u2019m more like a mother than I am a peer. A kind of sister-mother figure. I\u2019m very nonjudgmental. That\u2019s how I expected my clientele to be; that\u2019s how I expect my staff to be. That\u2019s what I demand of everybody. And once you set that tone\u2026\u201dShe trails off, but I spent ten years of the aughts going to Big Chicks\u2014I can fill in the rest. I\u2019ve been that boy leaning against the wall, lightheaded, cheap gin in my glass. Cruising the trans boys, the black girls, the grizzly raising eyebrows at me from the bar. And bears. Sometimes it seemed like it was only bears in the place\u2014muscle bears, cubby bears, ginger bears, otters. But at Big Chicks\u2014and only at Big Chicks\u2014a bear could not intimidate me. I sucked on a cigarette (this was back when people still smoked inside); I exhaled on the Diane Arbus photograph above me. I philosophized, drunkenly, that nobody gets to live with art like this; nobody gets to flirt and make out and spill beer in a museum. I went back to cruising. I tried to look tough, like I owned the place, like the floor was mine.The floor wasn\u2019t mine. The floor was Fire\u2019s. Now I\u2019m telling her how I used to feel those nights at Big Chicks, how I wanted to become part of the place, to be bolted to the wall like the photographs. Did she know what I meant? I felt calmer there, and maybe a little hopeful\u2014like Chicago, a city that could be so backward, could be as good as I thought it was. When I was here, I felt like a citizen, of the city and of the bar. Did that make sense? I\u2019m having a hard time articulating myself, I can\u2019t find the words. Fire cuts me off. \u201cIt\u2019s called safety,\u201d she says.The nighttime scene.\nPhoto by Wes Frazer\u201cA hulking, living art project\u201dEverybody\u2019s history looks logical in retrospect. In Fire\u2019s case, you can draw a straight line from her West Side childhood to her Far North Side queer bar. She was born tough to left-wing radical parents (a \u201cred diaper baby,\u201d she says). Her father was Jewish, her mother was gentile, \u201cand that was enough reason for everybody in the world to hate us.\u201dTheir neighbors threw trash at them. Her father got jumped in the alley. At school, kids would try to beat up Fire and her sister, but the girls fought back. It was a childhood that prepared her for bar life. \u201cIt allowed me to be very street savvy and undeterred by people coming at me,\u201d Fire says. Without those experiences, she would have never survived Uptown in the \u201980s.Fire peeking through the windows.\nPhoto by Matt HaasNothing could be beat out of Fire; she\u2019d just fight through. She studied art at UIC and made a place for herself in Chicago\u2019s art scene. For ten years, she hustled, making drawings and prints, tending bar, working catering gigs, manning the temporary tattoo stand at street fairs. In 1984 she landed that job at the Loading Dock\u2014an \u201call-consuming, very exhausting 5 a.m. bar.\u201d That\u2019s when she decided to, as she says, start participating in capitalism.She started saving, though she didn\u2019t know what for. She knew she never wanted to borrow money, and she knew she wanted to be prepared. She\u2019d eyed the art deco terra-cotta buildings on the North Side forever\u2014it\u2019s what she used to draw. When the bar that became Big Chicks came up for rent, she had just enough money to grab it.In the early years she worked 80-hour weeks. She\u2019d open her bar in the morning, when the old guys would come in, and work a shift at the Loading Dock at night. In 2003, long after Big Chicks stopped keeping morning hours, Fire opened an all-day restaurant next door, Tweet. And like that, she was working 80-hour weeks again.Those hours forced her to stop making art, \u201cbut that\u2019s fine,\u201d she says, and it sounds like she means it. Big Chicks and Tweet are hulking, living art projects\u2014experiments in business and community.Diners at Tweet, Fire\u2019s restaurant next to Big Chicks.\nPhoto by Wes Frazer\u201cThe uncommon energy of community\u201d\u201cWhen you travel around the country, you realize how homogenized everything has become,\u201d Fire says to me. She\u2019s not talking about gay bars specifically, but that\u2019s where my mind goes. I think about the gay bars I know where skinny boys and fat genderqueers grind on the same dance floor. And I think about the more common gay bars, the ones full of white guys on their phones. There are some nights\u2014especially ever since the Far North Side became wealthier, as all those SROs became condos\u2014when Big Chicks looks homogenized too.The red velvet cake.\nPhoto by Matt HaasBut even then, there\u2019s the art. And there\u2019s the red velvet cake from Tweet, which you can order at the bar. (I used to eat foot-tall slices off a porcelain plate while I danced.) And even when it\u2019s dead at Big Chicks, there\u2019s the uncommon energy of community, a mostly silent acknowledgement that everybody is there for the same thing: to drink, to dance, to hook up in a dark corner. To feed cake to each other on the dance floor. To eat on Sunday, when Michelle stills feeds us for free. To flirt with other queers in line for the bathroom.Queer was a slur when Big Chicks opened; Fire would never have uttered it to describe her clientele. But we\u2019ve been here from the beginning. The SRO guys who stuck around for so many years used a different term when they finally pulled Fire aside and whispered in her ear, but still, they spoke up. \u201cMichelle,\u201d they confessed. \u201cWe\u2019re gay too.\u201dDavid Tamarkin is the digital director of Epicurious.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Explore Bon App\u00e9titNeighborhood RestaurantsChicagoRecipes you want to make.
