Make it ahead of time and dress your salad before you put the finishing touches on your Thanksgiving meal; the salad should sit for a few minutes before serving to ensure the kale is tender. If you don\u2019t have a food processor, you can chop your ingredients by hand\u2014the finished dressing won\u2019t be as creamy, but it will still taste great.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

StephanieRichmond,VA11/27/2021Awesome salad!! Had to thin out the dressing with more vinegar and olive oil.

It's so delicious and very easy to make.  It's been requested 3 Sundays in a row.  Even if I make a different salad next Sunday, I will definitely keep a jar of the vinaigrette on hand.GenevaCedar Rapids, Ia11/14/2021I also ended up with a paste for dressing, but the flavor was great and I just thinned it out with a little more oil and vinegar.  AnonymousSeattle, WA11/13/2021Ratio for dressing is off. I have a paste. Needed much less pecans and more oil Anonymous11/5/2021This was fabulous!!! My husband had 3 portions.  We both loved it and I expect it to be a regular this winter.Peggy WNC11/3/2021I used walnuts instead of pecans because that\u2019s what I had, warmed the salad up a little bit in the oven as I wanted more of a \u2018warm\u2019 salad, and topped with roast chicken and grated Parmesan. Was amazing!!! Would absolutely make again. MeganNashville, TN11/2/2021Excellent flavor, but it came out very thick. Will need to add more oil or less pecans.AnonymousChicago10/30/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titKaleLeafy GreensVegetableSaladSidePecanNutThanksgivingFallWinterVegetarianDinnerLunchGluten-FreeRecipes you want to make.
