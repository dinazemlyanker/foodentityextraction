Not the deep longing to eject myself from the swampy streets of Manhattan. Not the drastic rise in my electric bill. Not the spike in personal soft serve consumption. No, it\u2019s only once that buttery pastry hits my open hands during my annual getaway to Maine that I know the season has truly arrived.Now, if you\u2019ve read Bon App\u00e9tit at any point over the past four years, you\u2019ll probably recognize the Tandem name. It was one of our 50 Best New Restaurants in 2015, and its continued excellence was one of the reasons that the bakery\u2019s hometown of Portland, Maine, was named our 2018 Food City of the Year. Everything behind baker Briana Holt\u2019s pastry case is exquisite, but it\u2019s her loaded biscuit (paired with an espresso) that really gets me. The layers of flaky, buttery dough; the deeply browned exterior; the crispy nooks and crunchy crannies; the fluffy interior; the not-so-modest swipe of grassy butter; the lava flow of whatever housemade jam they\u2019ve got that day\u2014always the right balance of bright, sweet, and faintly tart in the way that the best blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries are.So if you happen to see me at Tandem this summer, please, I beg you, don\u2019t say a thing. You are witnessing the single most anticipated moment of my year. Let me enjoy myself, uninterrupted. Then\u2014after only crumbs and butter marks remain on my plate\u2014you can tell me that I need to move to the back of the line, behind the other patient customers, to get myself another biscuit.Go there: Tandem Coffee + BakeryExplore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsPortland MaineHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make.
