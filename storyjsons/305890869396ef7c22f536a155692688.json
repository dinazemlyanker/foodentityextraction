It does make everything taste better.  I used to live in Hong Kong and the locals told me only cheap restaurants use MSG as it's a shortcut to make food taste great without the more expensive option of using good ingredients.  But, no thanks!  I prefer to avoid the headache, dry mouth, and diarrhea.  As for anti-MSG being racist:  That's crazy.  All the local people in my office (Hong Kong Chinese) also avoided MSG as much as possible.  RickWMontana3/22/2022the people hating on msg are so dumb and racist. this recipe makes to die for wings and without the MSG it just isn't the same.AnonymousChicago, IL1/26/2022Great recipe for wings - used MSG as suggested. Love it ! RtSingapore 8/12/2021Recipe is incredible. Don\u2019t believe these lies against MSG that are rooted in racism. Anonymous2/7/2021Why would you suggest to use MSG ?? If you cannot create a recipe to be great on it\u2019s own, then do not create it at all !! THINK before you add MSG to any recipe. Do you know how many people are allergic to MSG ?? Do not even to begin to tell me that MSG doesn\u2019t make people ill, because I become very ill, if I unknowingly  happen to eat food with MSG in it. I am very disappointed that you would print a recipe and then tell the public to use MSG to enhance the flavor. DO NOT make or print a recipe, if you cannot make it taste really good, UNLESS you have to use MSG !!!!!!!!AnonymousBuena Park, CA2/3/2021Made these with some hefty full size bone-in-skin-on wings from the farmers market and they turned out perfectly! Didn\u2019t use the MSG (does anyone else get bad dreams when they eat msg?!) and it Seemed a little under seasoned but overall very very good. Didn\u2019t use any fresh herbs or the cukes either and we still raved about them. Definitely the longer ahead of time you spice them the better! AnonymousSpokane , WA6/19/2020these are amazing - i made them two nights in a row!!! i followed the recipe exactly (except for the MSG) and thought they were so perfectly flavorful. The broiling at the end made the skin so nice and crispy. 5 minutes for me was perfect, flipping halfway through. Careful not to burn them!AnonymousChicago6/1/2020can the spice rub be made without the MSG?AnonymousArizona3/10/2020These are TO DIE for! I cannot recommend these enough. They're so easy, but packed with salty and umami goodness. The hit of acid with the lime at the end brings the dish home. 10/10 - will make again in a heartbeat. I'd even proudly serve these at a party. Great job, Carla!AnonymousMichigan9/3/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titChicken WingChickenPoultryPaprikaHerbs & SpicesEasyWeeknight MealsMainStarterDairy-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreeBroilSuper BowlFourth Of JulyMemorial DayLabor DayDinnerRecipes you want to make.
