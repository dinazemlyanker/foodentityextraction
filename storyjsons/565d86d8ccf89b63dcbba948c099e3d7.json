While completely dominating in her events for Team USA, Chloe, like me, was thinking about food.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.On Monday, Chloe tweeted about craving ice cream while literally in the middle of the women's halfpipe qualifications. \"Could be down for some ice cream rn,\" she wrote. A fan asked, \"Aren\u2019t you competing right now?\" and she responded simply \"yes...\" Now, the Olympian is back at it again, this time tweeting about a breakfast sandwich. She wrote on Twitter mid-competition, \"Wish I finished my breakfast sandwich but my stubborn self decided not to and now I'm getting hangry.\" But despite her hanger, Chloe went on to become the youngest-ever gold medalist in the halfpipe event.According to an ESPN reporter, when asked why she was tweeting during the competition, Chloe said, \"Like, what else are you supposed to do?\u201dBesides ice cream and breakfast sandwiches, Chloe tweeted about eating two churros over the weekend, which not only satisfied her sweet tooth but apparently also helped calm her nerves. Soon thereafter, Momofuku chef and NBC food and culture expert David Chang brought a batch of churro ice cream sandwiches\u2014made with pizza dough from the Olympic cafeteria\u2014to Kim to congratulate her.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.The proof is in the ice cream: In 2016, Chloe became the first person under the age of 16 to win three gold medals at an X Games and the first woman to land back-to-back 1080 spins in a snowboarding competition. Not to mention the second person ever to receive a perfect, 100-point score. And we'd give her Twitter game a solid \ud83d\udcaf.Explore Bon App\u00e9titTrends + NewsRecipes you want to make.
