Breakfast Blondies Are Here to Make Your Mornings BetterBetween these blondies and Daylight Saving, your mornings are getting brighter.By Anna StockwellMarch 12, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsea Kyle, Food Styling by Michelle GattonFacebookTwitterEmailEating a proper breakfast on weekdays just doesn\u2019t happen for most people, including me. I am perpetually late, usually groggy, and often cranky, but I also demand coffee and sustenance as soon as I finally stop hitting snooze and get out of bed. That\u2019s why a little breakfast meal prep can save my day. In a perfect world I would always have a batch of these low-sugar, high-protein-and-fiber, gluten-free Breakfast Blondies on hand to eat while simultaneously getting dressed, grooming my eyebrows, and applying Living Luminizer to my face. In real life, I do breakfast meal prep maybe once a month. But when it happens, everything is better in my world.Remaking desserts so they\u2019re suitable for breakfast is one of our favorite pastimes (see: breakfast cookies). A breakfast blondie was a natural next step, but it was harder than I expected. It took me three failed attempts at making classic blondies with gluten-free flours instead of wheat to realize that this was not the right direction\u2014not enough real sustenance in there to count as breakfast, and they required too much sugar to make it work. Two more failures involving a mix of almond butter and oat flour. Then I realized that almond butter can actually take the place of flour. Have you ever had flourless peanut butter cookies? It works, trust me! I kept some flax meal in there, because ground flax seeds are good for us all, especially in the morning. And I began each batch by browning butter and toasting nuts at the same time, a trick I am especially fond of for improving the flavor of both the nuts and the butter. (These breakfast blondies work with any variety of nut, or a mix, but I especially like walnuts since it feels like a classic blondie move.)I played with using either maple syrup or coconut sugar, because of course there should be no refined sugar in my breakfast, please. Maple syrup tasted the best, so all that was left was to figure out the eggs. Turns out that three eggs whisked (not stirred!) vigorously into the batter was the secret to a shiny crackly top and a moist center.A total of 10 batches of blondies later, I landed where I wanted to be. I fed one to my coworker Emily who thought it was a normal blondie and looked a little confused after a few bites.\u201cThis is really good, Anna, and I like it, but did you know this blondie tastes kind of like a healthy muffin?\u201d She was worried that I had done something wrong.\u201cNo, no Emily, this is a breakfast blondie,\u201d I explained.\u201cOoooooh. Well then, it\u2019s perfect.\u201d And I have to admit that I agree.It's the most important meal of the dayBreakfast BlondiesForget breakfast bars or muffins: Our new favorite grab-and-go breakfast is a blondie.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishGluten FreeBreakfastBakeAlmondRead MoreLifestyleThese Muesli Muffins Are Peak Fall...And They Happen to Be Gluten FreeBy Anna StockwellRecipes you want to make.
