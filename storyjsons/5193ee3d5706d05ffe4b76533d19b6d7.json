And I\u2019m no different\u2014except for the fact that my college love was Shin Ramyun .We met late one night in the dorms through my roommate/bad habit enabler Macs. When they pulled out a pack emblazoned in red and black with bold, all caps type, I couldn\u2019t look away. And when Macs realized I hadn\u2019t tried it before, the light berating began. How could I, an \u201cadult\u201d (no one is a real adult at 19), settle for anything other than a pack of instant ramyun that, with the addition of hot water and time, transformed into springy, chewy noodles swimming in a peppery, extremely slurpable broth?Photo by Laura MurrayMacs slid me a bowl of Shin. I wolfed it down in less time than it took to make it. My heart beat in my ears. My forehead shone with each warming spoonful of broth. I got as close to blushing as I\u2019d ever been. The ashen red spice mix turned water into a nasal-clearing, sweat-inducing beefy broth. All that paired with perfectly toothsome noodles, and I was hooked. Days after, I scoured nearby convenience stores, the student center, even the little stores connected to dining halls that peddled random pantry goods in search of the ramyun. I was in deep. I still am.Yes, me and my college crush are still together, and I stock packs of Shin Ramyun like a (responsible, non-hoarding) doomsday prepper\u2014and there are plenty of food reasons why! They\u2019re an ideal meal as I find myself leaving home less and craving comfort more. They don\u2019t require anything but hot water and time, and can accommodate any vegetables I might have lingering in my fridge. Plus, I never have to worry about doing an onslaught of dishes afterward\u2014just the assurance I need as my will to hand wash literally anything nears non-existence. They\u2019re fast and filling on the many days when I can barely bring myself to cook anything at all. Everything may feel up in the air in the current moment, but my love for Shin Ramyun is unwavering.Buy It: Nongshim Shin Ramyun, Gourmet Spicy, $37 for 16 packs on AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
