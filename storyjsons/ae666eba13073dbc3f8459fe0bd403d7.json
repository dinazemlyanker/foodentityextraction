His exacting attention to detail, from the rice to the sourcing of the fish, makes each nigiri shine\u2014and earned Nimblefish a spot in our 2018 Hot 10 list.ORDER: whatever you want! There isn't an omakase format at the moment, so go with your gut. From the tenderly boiled octopus over salty Calrose rice to salt-and-sugar-smoked king salmon to the soy-marinated tuna, you can\u2019t go wrong.THE VIBE IS: intimate. At the counter, you\u2019re face-to-face with Auger and his crew, who hand over each nigiri as they\u2019re made to order.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day, 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. Make sure you line up early since the wait can be long.WE ALSO LOVEG\u00fceroTorta is just another way of saying \u201csandwich that will change your life\u201dLe PigeonThe restaurant that put Portland on the national culinary map AfuriA Japanese ramen chain we hope conquers AmericaExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
