Cover and chill.How would you rate Plantain and Lamb Casserole?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleI had a bit of a learning curve on slicing the plantains evenly--and having 5 on hand instead of 4 would be my plan for next time--but this came out really well. I used an oval CorningWare that is my go-to for casseroles, and that was the right size for two layers of fried plantains. They weren't all nestled as closely as they could have been, and another 3 or 4 slices would have been perfect. Tamping down the top fit everything in nicely and there was no overflowing of the cheese and custard layers on top. The top browned beautifully. \nIt did take quite a bit of time to make this, but it was worth it. The picadillo component was delicious and making it with beef instead of lamb would also work and be somewhat cheaper. The 10 minute resting period was enough for everything to be solid enough to slice for serving. I didn't slice up the rest to portion for leftovers until later, and everything had cooled so much that there was a crumbling problem getting some of it out. Next time I would cut and remove all of it from the casserole after that 10 minute period.Anonymous9/7/2018Essentially shepherd's pie from New Orleans. Pretty solid. Use between 1-2 eggs (3 is definitely overkill) and you probably need 2 additional plantains. Doing this in a relatively deep Dutch oven is also preferable given the volume of food here. canadianbaconBoston by way of Hamilton5/14/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titCasserolePlantainVegetableGround LambLambMeatCheddarCheeseTomatoMainGluten-FreeNut-FreeDinnerRecipes you want to make.
