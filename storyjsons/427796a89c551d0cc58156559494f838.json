Once the temperature drops to 70 degrees, I break out my coziest coats and bake every apple- or pumpkin-based dessert we have on the BA website. But I\u2019m not a Fall Drink Person. Meaning I\u2019m not into \u201cfall\u201d-flavored things, like pumpkin-infused cold brews and maple-spiked ciders, because they never seem to taste like what they\u2019re supposed to be emulating. Have the people behind them ever even tasted a pumpkin before?!But once I got my hands on a bottle of Don Ciccio & Figli\u2019s Ambrosia, I found my Fall Drink.Made with turmeric, blood oranges, and cantaloupe, this aperitivo is bright and citrusy. The first swig tastes how it feels wearing your fuzziest sweater at golden hour and watching the sun set: warm and inviting. It\u2019s super balanced on its own, so you can sip it on the rocks, but also complex enough to make into a spritz\u2014(yes, a fall spritz! I like to pair it with cider, like this cute little number), and adaptable too. I\u2019ve slipped it into a Paper Plane, a bold and tart mix of amaro, aperitivo, whiskey, and lemon juice, for a more nuanced take that other popular aperitivi don\u2019t always provide.So as the temperatures continue to drop, you can easily guess what I\u2019ll be doing: drinking this little elixir in an attempt to extend fall for another four months. A Fall Person can dream.Buy it: Don Ciccio & Figli Ambrosia, $35 at Warehouse Wines & SpiritsAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
