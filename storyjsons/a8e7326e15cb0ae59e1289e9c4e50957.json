Like, jaw on the floor levels of good. I've made them a couple of times since and they are always a winning side.broazayBushwick5/9/2020In a few words: An extremely easy method with outstanding results! I diced my potatoes, used chicken broth instead of water (per Julie Everett's suggestion), and steamed them for about 20 minutes. I then used rosemary and garlic powder in addition to the olive oil, salt, and pepper, and let those bake for 25 minutes. I am SO incredibly impressed and delighted by the results, and I will DEFINITELY be utilizing this method whenever I possibly can moving forward!talmillercalifornia4/2/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titPotatoVegetableYukon Gold PotatoSideBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
