Use any flavor jam you like and feel free to choose one hue of sesame seeds (though the combination of black and white makes for the most stunning appearance). To keep these as chewy and tender as possible, pull them from the oven while they\u2019re still soft\u2014they\u2019ll firm up as they cool on the baking sheets.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt1large egg\u00bdcup (100 g) granulated sugar\u00bdcup (packed; 100 g) light brown sugar\u00bdcup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature\u00bctsp. almond extract (optional)\u00bdcup well-mixed tahini\u00bccup black sesame seeds\u00bccup white sesame seeds\u2154cup raspberry jamPreparationStep 1Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 375\u00b0. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl to combine. Beat egg, granulated sugar, brown sugar, butter, and almond extract (if using) in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add tahini and beat, scraping down sides of bowl as needed, until combined. Reduce speed to low and add dry ingredients in 2 additions, mixing until completely combined after each addition. (Dough will be soft at this point.) Cover bowl and chill dough 30 minutes.Step 2Mix black and white sesame seeds in a shallow bowl or dish. Working one at a time, scoop out dough by the tablespoonful and roll into balls. Roll each ball in sesame seeds to coat and divide between 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing about 2\" apart.Step 3Bake cookies until slightly puffed and spread, 6\u20138 minutes. Remove from oven and press handle of a whisk or wooden spoon about halfway down into the center of each cookie to create a small well (the cookies will be too hot to use your thumb). Dollop about \u00bd tsp. jam into indentation in each cookie. Return cookies to oven, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and front to back, and bake until golden around edges and jam is beginning to set, 6\u20138 minutes. Let cookies cool on baking sheets before eating. (They will be soft right out of the oven but will firm up as they cool.)Do ahead: Cookies can baked 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.How would you rate Raspberry-Tahini Thumbprint Cookies?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (6)Back to TopTriangleNew favorite. Doubled the almond extract as previously recommended and used Heidi's Raspberry Red Chile Ginger jam for the filling. Delicious!JenCNew York, NY3/12/2022I made these twice this week - they went fast the first time and are sure to go fast this time. One tip - if you find not enough seeds are sticking to the dough as you make the balls, dip it in water before rolling it in seeds. More will stick. \n\nIf you like sesame, these are perfect. I didn't have the almond extract on hand and they were still very flavorful. Only slightly harder than chocolate chip cookies due to the two-stage cook and 1/2 hour wait time for the dough to firm up, but they look and taste special. Chef JohnnyCalifornia3/12/2022Easy and delicious.  Doubled the almond extract and wouldn\u2019t advise skipping it.  Fantastic cookies. StephanieSan Diego2/27/2022These were a real treat \u2014 add in the varied textures and tastes factor and a home run hit. Thumb print styles are always great for littles in the kitchen too. Our 9, 8, and 4 year old got in in the action. Thank you!@blondeappleCT2/27/2022So delicious and so easy to make! Almond extract is very subtle and enhances the cookie favor.Cassandra Jersey City, NJ2/22/2022These are delicious. They are buttery, nutty, and a little tangy from the raspberry jam. I did add the almond extract, it is a light flavor; may even double it next time. Loved these!Heather Orlando, FL2/20/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titDessertBakingCookieTahiniCondiments, Sauces & PastesRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
