But the thing about that (very delicious) pesto is that it's not very friendly to people who can't eat dairy or nuts. And if said people are already suffering from a nut allergy or the inability to eat cheese, it is basically criminal to deny them pesto as well.Enter this golden raisin pesto. Yes... I said \"raisin pesto.\" Senior food editor Andy Baraghani, the man responsible for this blasphemous-yet-delicious vegan pesto, didn't set out to create an allergy-friendly dish. He just wanted a sauce that would cut through the rich, gamey taste of lamb meatballs. But, it turns out, just as nuts can turn chopped herbs and cheese into a luxurious, silky sauce, raisins can do the same.Don't be fooled\u2014this pesto doesn't taste like dessert at all. The recipe uses a lot of herbs\u2014mint and parsley, to be exact\u2014to keep the sweetness of the raisins in check. The pesto goes great on the lamb, of course, but I also stirred it into plain yogurt and ate it on toast, and it would be amazing as a sauce for fish. Plus, leftovers are ideal for spooning directly from the jar when you can't sleep at 3:26 a.m. (maybe you also ate a handful of chocolate chips you found in the cupboard, I'm not telling).And, if you really don't love raisins, Baraghani suggests swapping them with another dried fruit like figs, apricots, or dried cherries.And, as someone who would never avoid cheese when there is an occasion to eat cheese, I have to say: I don't miss the dairy.There's a new green sauce in your future:Lamb Meatballs with Raisin PestoRaisins in your pesto?!?
