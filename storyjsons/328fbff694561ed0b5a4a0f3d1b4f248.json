This recipe is from Che Fico in San Francisco, CA, our No. 7 Best New Restaurant 2018.IngredientsMakes 4Dough\u00becup (1\u00bd sticks) unsalted butter, cut into pieces, frozen 10 minutes1\u00becups all-purpose flour2tsp. sugar1tsp. kosher salt\u00bctsp. distilled white vinegarFrangipane and Assembly\u00bdcup semolina flour1tsp. kosher salt7Tbsp. sugar, divided4\u00bdtsp. all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting1grapefruit1orange\u00betsp. vanilla paste or extract4Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature, plus 2 Tbsp. melted1large egg1large egg yolkPreparationDoughStep 1Beat butter, flour, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on low speed until butter is in flat pieces the size of a nickel or smaller (mixture should look slightly sandy). Combine vinegar and \u00bc cup ice water in a small bowl and, with motor on low speed, stream into mixture. Beat, adding another 1\u20132 tsp. ice water if needed, until no dry spots remain. Continue to beat until dough begins to clump together, but stop before it starts to form a ball.Step 2Transfer dough to a surface; squeeze and flatten a couple times to bring together. Divide into 4 pieces. Flatten into \u00bd\"-thick disks; wrap tightly in plastic. Chill at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.Frangipane and AssemblyStep 3Place a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 400\u00b0. Whisk semolina flour, salt, 5 Tbsp. sugar, and 1 Tbsp. plus 1\u00bd tsp. all-purpose flour in a medium bowl. Finely grate zest from grapefruit and orange into another medium bowl; set fruit aside. Add vanilla paste and 4 Tbsp. room-temperature butter to bowl with zest and mix until smooth. Add egg and egg yolk and mix vigorously to combine. Add dry ingredients; mix just until incorporated.Step 4Cut remaining peel and pith away from reserved citrus; discard. Slice fruit into \u00bd\"-thick rounds; wriggle out seeds.Step 5Working one at a time, roll out dough disks on a lightly floured surface to 8\" rounds. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and spread \u00bc cup frangipane in the center of each, leaving a 1\u00bd\" border. Arrange citrus rounds over frangipane to cover, then fold edges of dough up and over fruit. Chill 30 minutes.Step 6Brush fruit and crust with melted butter and sprinkle with remaining 2 Tbsp. sugar (avoid getting it on the baking sheet). Bake crostatas, rotating once, until crusts are golden brown with a few darker spots, 40\u201345 minutes. Let cool at least 10 minutes before serving.How would you rate Grapefruit-Orange Crostatas?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (1)Back to TopTriangleCitrus and perfect frangipane aside, I just love this dough recipe; I use it for every pie/tart/crostata. It's pretty much no-fail with cold ingredients and a gentle hand. (Have a stand mixer but prefer to mix with hands, comes out fire every time.)AnonymousBrooklyn, NY10/16/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titFruit DessertDessertGaletteItalianEuropeanGrapefruitCitrusFruitOrangeSemolina FlourFlourWinterBakingRecipes you want to make.
