Lots and lots of it. So much of it, in fact, that the thing I most appreciate is stuffing my face at Denino\u2019s Pizzeria & Tavern and then stuffing it a little more at the original Ralph\u2019s Famous Italian Ices. The two establishments in the Port Richmond area are neighbors, best friends, and restaurant soul mates.Denino\u2019s, open in the same spot in Staten Island since 1937.\nPhoto by Jaime JoshiRalph Silvestro opened his namesake dessert joint in 1928, and it\u2019s remained in the same spot ever since. Denino\u2019s opened right across the street in the \u201930s and started slinging pies a couple of decades later once Carlo (last name Denino, if that wasn\u2019t obvious) took over the tavern. Both have opened other locations. (There are more than 60 Ralph\u2019s now in the Tri-state area.) Both have expanded their menus, adding contemporary flavors and combinations\u2014like clam pizza and the M.O.R., my favorite pie, with tiny meatballs, fresh onions, and creamy ricotta\u2014to round out the classic mozzarella sticks, fried calamari, and eggplant Parm. At Ralph\u2019s, I can\u2019t leave without one scoop of rainbow cookie, a neon-yellow cr\u00e8me ice filled with chunks of the almondy tricolor pastries, one of the 150-plus newer flavors they\u2019ve developed since the original lemon ice. Both are still family businesses.The current management, Ralph\u2019s grandson Larry Silvestro and Carlo\u2019s stepson Michael Burke, have known each other their whole lives. \u201cWe\u2019ve always looked out for each other,\u201d Larry says. \u201cWe go way back.\u201d When the Italian ices aren\u2019t in season and Ralph\u2019s is closed, Michael will call if anything looks fishy. (A few winters ago, a tip about a burst pipe saved Larry lots of trouble.) On super busy nights, Larry lets Denino\u2019s use his parking lot.So sure, you could go to Denino\u2019s and just get the margherita pizza, or go to Ralph\u2019s just for vanilla chip. But why would you go to one when you could have both?Myles Tanzer is a writer living in Brooklyn.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsItalian AmericanRed SauceNew YorkRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
