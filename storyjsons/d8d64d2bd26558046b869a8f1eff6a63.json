Once I have a plastic bag (or a grudge :-)), it\u2019s mine for life. This explains why, when we recently moved apartments, I unpacked about 30 used plastic bags in various states of cleanliness. I do feel justified, however: Bags like these take hundreds of years to degrade in a landfill and may end up in the oceans, where they kill marine life like turtles. So why not scrub them with soap, drape them all over my kitchen and living room to air-dry, and then pack them up and tote like pets and prized trinkets across state lines?My partner, who is constantly sniffing and inspecting the elderly bags, wondering if they\u2019re safe for storing fresh cheese or newly washed herbs, tends to disagree. Try as I might, disposable plastic bags cannot last in my kitchen rotation forever.But what can withstand years of wear are these silicone Zip Top bags, which don\u2019t get thin or cloudy or ripped, no matter how many times I wash and dry them. I use them anywhere I\u2019d use plastic: for freezing bananas and fruits for smoothies, decanting mostly empty boxes of pastas and grains to save space in my pantry, tucking a sandwich or a snack for a long car ride. They have all of the benefits of plastic bags\u2014space-saving, lightweight, convenient\u2014and then some. Because they have flat bottoms, I can use them to hold liquids, like soups and sauces, so that they don\u2019t leak or flop, as well as delicate items (like grapes and raspberries) that shouldn\u2019t risk getting smashed. They\u2019re also freezer-, microwave-, and dishwasher-safe. And since a Zip Top container stays open, I can eat my grain salad directly out of one\u2014which is handy when I\u2019m too lazy to wash a bowl. My plastic bags can\u2019t do any of that!Even with my set of three, I\u2019ve found myself reaching for the box of plastic bags with a lot less frequency. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I\u2019m going to keep my old plastic bags in the rotation until I\u2019m made to say goodbye\u2014but let\u2019s just say I won\u2019t be adding new athletes to the team anytime soon.Photo by Emma FishmanReusable Zip Top Storage Bags (Set of 3)$48 at Amazon$48 at HiveExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendShoppingRecipes you want to make.
