I did drama club, but I was always begrudgingly cast as a member of the chorus or a nameless townsperson. And I was in the environmental club, but we met...like three times a year. Now I\u2019m a little different. I have a club I\u2019m very invested in. It\u2019s called Leon Circle and it\u2019s a wine club from Leon and Sons, a small, natural wine\u2013focused shop in Brooklyn.When people ask me how to \u201cget into wine,\u201d I tell them to just open a bottle of wine and drink it. \u201cBut where do I start? How do I know which grapes taste like what or which regions matter?\" With Leon Circle\u2019s wine club, you don\u2019t have to worry about that. Owner Chris Leon chooses three bottles of wine per month for $75 and ships nationally. (Or you can pick them up from his Clinton Hill shop, if you live in Brooklyn like me.) The selections range from producers all over the world, even countries like Hungary or Georgia, which have been making wine, like those skin-contact ones you can\u2019t get enough of, for thousands of years. Helpful tasting notes about the grapes, soil types, regional climates\u2014the real nerdy stuff that\u2019s actually going to teach you about what you like and don\u2019t like\u2014come conveniently stowed in your cute little wine briefcase. And if you\u2019re afraid of commitment, you can drop in or out of the club as you please (much like I did with drama club after my junior year of high school), so it makes a good one-time gift for that friend or loved one who follows the entire BA staff on Instagram and can\u2019t get enough of our shots of natty bottles.So like I said before, the best way to get into wine is to try wine, and Leon Circle makes it easy. It\u2019s the only club I\u2019ll enthusiastically stick around for.Buy it: Leon Circle Wine ClubExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendWineBrooklynRecipes you want to make.
