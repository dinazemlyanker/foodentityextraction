Swiss cheese, thinly sliced1large egg1tsp. heavy creamPreparationStep 1Roll out 1 package of puff pastry on a floured surface to a 16x12\" rectangle. Transfer to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and chill while you roll out remaining sheet of pastry. Transfer to another parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and chill both sheets of pastry until cold, about 15 minutes.Step 2Transfer parchment with pastry to a clean surface. Spread \u00bc cup mustard evenly over 1 sheet of pastry, leaving a \u00bd\" border around the edges. Layer ham, then cheese over mustard. Fold border of pastry up over edge of filling. Brush edges lightly with water. Arrange remaining sheet of pastry on top, then trim edges with kitchen shears or a sharp knife so top layer fits over bottom with no overhang. Crimp edges with a fork. Using parchment, slide pastry back onto baking sheet. Chill, uncovered, at least 30 minutes.Step 3Preheat oven to 400\u00b0. Lightly beat egg and cream in a small bowl to blend. Brush egg wash evenly over puff pastry. Cut thin slits in a decorative pattern into top of pastry to allow steam to escape. Bake feuillet\u00e9, rotating pan halfway through, until puffed and deep golden brown, 30\u201335 minutes. Let cool slightly before cutting into 1\u00bd\" squares. Serve warm with additional mustard alongside.Step 4Do Ahead: Feuillet\u00e9 can be assembled 12 hours ahead.

We were just a small party (big surprise that) so I just used a part sheet and folded it over rather more filling than was specified.. There were none left.Rick BChatham, ON12/28/2021I just made these again and they didn't turn out as well as my first time.   Make sure you really let the dough defrost overnight and double up on the ham. My husband said he couldn't really taste the ham and cheese inside. Otherwise, I will continue to make these for parties. Diane OBerkeley Heights, NJ12/19/2021I made these for a large thanksgiving gathering and they were a huge hit!! Everyone kept saying how good they were and ate them all up.  The recipe was super easy to follow and make and I will be making these for parties from now on.  Thanks Martha!!Diane OBerkeley Heights, NJ11/26/2021Made these for a NYE party and they were definitely the star of the show. So simple and delicious. AnonymousBrooklyn, NY1/5/2020This was super easy and ended up being a hit at the NYE party! I also was curious about the quantity of puff pastry -- I don't know if this is technically the right way, but in order to get the 12\" x 16\" rectangles, I did need two packages of puff pastry with two sheets in each one. I kind of connected the puff pastry sheets on the short side and made a seam by pinching the edges together and it worked fine, especially since you are cutting the feuillete anyway. Super delicious and looked impressive.AnonymousDetroit, MI1/1/2020This looks fabulous and I want to make it but I\u2019m confused by the fact that the recipe calls for two packages of puff pastry. They all come with two sheets per package so are you supposed to use two sheets on the bottom and two on top or one sheet each? Anonymous12/25/2019Brought this to game night with friends, it was a hit. Super easy to make. Only change I might make in the future is doubling the amount of ham to balance out the puff pastry/filling ratio.AnonymousMinneapolis, MN12/22/2019Wow!  this recipe was amazing!  can't wait to make it again! Anonymous11/25/2019I would make this recipe over and over again, and experiment with different fillings. It\u2019s easy but it looks like a showstopper! It was a huge hit for a holiday gathering.
