You must try the borek jibn\u00e9, superlight fried dumplings filled with molten baladi cheese and served with tomato sauce for dipping, and the hummus lahm\u00e9, hummus topped with flavorful lamb. Finish the meal with a scoop of baklava ice cream and a glass of cardamom saffron tea.THE VIBE IS: very festive, thanks to red beaded light fixtures, lanterns, and tiled walls. The huge dining room is crowded almost every night, mostly with families and couples on date night, so grab a seat at the bar where you can see right into the kitchen: one cook sprinkling dishes with fresh herbs, another making pita to order.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day: Monday to Thursday 5 p.m. to 10 p.m., Friday 5 p.m. to 11 p.m., Saturday 4 p.m. to 11 p.m., and Sunday 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. Reserve ahead of time via OpenTable, especially on the weekends but also during the week for good measure.\u2014Claire SaffitzPhoto by Dominique LafondWE ALSO LOVELe MoussoSplurge a little on this innovative tasting-menu-powered restaurant in the Gay VillageArthurs Nosh BarThe Saint-Henri Jewish(ish) deli with lines out the doorAgrikolIn the Gay Village, a rum-fueled oasis run by Arcade Fire Explore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
