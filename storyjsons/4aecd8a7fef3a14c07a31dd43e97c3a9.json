This recipe calls for the latter, which is thin and seedless, but if you can find only the pulp, cook it down with equal parts water for 10\u201315 minutes until it\u2019s the texture of caramel, then strain out the seeds. Brush any leftover tamarind onto whole fish before roasting, or lacquer it onto bone-in pork chops. One commonly available brand is Swad, which you can find at South Asian and West Indian grocery stores, Whole Foods, or on Amazon. This recipe is part of the 2021\u00a0Feel Good Food Plan, our eight-day dinner plan for starting the year off right.Ingredients4 servings8skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs\u00a0 (about 2\u00bd lb.), patted dryKosher salt2serrano chiles, coarsely chopped12\" piece ginger, peeled,\u00a0 chopped3garlic cloves\u2153cup tamarind concentrate3Tbsp. coconut aminos2Tbsp. agave nectar2tsp. ground cinnamon1tsp. ground nutmeg\u00bdcup plus 3 Tbsp. fresh orange juice (from about 2 oranges)3Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided2medium Japanese sweet potatoes or other sweet potatoes (about\u00a0 1 lb.), scrubbed, sliced into 1/8\"\u20131/4\"-thick roundsHalf a bunch collard greens (about 6 oz.), stems removed, leaves cut or torn into bite-size piecesFreshly ground black pepperPreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 375\u00b0.

I've made it 6 or 7 times and it's always a big hit!  I slice the potatoes around 1/8\", microwave them for 1-1/2 minutes with a little water in the bowl.  Once I remove the browned chicken from the pan, I put the potatoes in the pan, then into the oven for 10 minutes before placing the chicken on top of the potatoes.  This gives the potatoes enough time to cook without overcooking the chicken.  The tamarind gives just the right amount of tartness.AnonymousPortland, Oregon6/3/2021After reading the reviews on the meal. I didn't pour the glaze on the chicken until after I crisped the chicken skin. It definitely would've burned. However, with that small tweak it was delicious. I made a single portion and come prefect it throughout the week I think I over cooked the potatoes. I'll have to remind myself to remove them halfway thru. All in all, very good.JasHayward, CA5/12/2021Horrible recipe. Tried to leave one star but it shows 5 and won't change. Unimpressed Asheville 3/11/2021So I'm in agreement with most of the other reviewers here.  The flavors are close to spot on but the technique left me scratching my head.  Sweet potatoes done at 375F for 10 minutes?\n\nTo improve on this recipe I would throw the potatoes in a sheet pan and drizzle a little bit of the sauce on top and roast em for half an hour or so while you cook the chicken.  The chicken could use less time in the skillet as well cuz parts of the sauce burned before the rest was ready.  Id then throw the chicken on top of the potatoes for the final 10 minutes of cook time.\n\nSo far recipe as is is 3/5 stars but with some tweaks it will be a regular weeknight staple.SpencerCleveland2/26/2021I agree with most of the comments here; the instructions, timing, and ordering do not represent bon app\u00e9tit's finest moment. Before making this, I read the directions below and incorporated the helpful comments. The result was a wonderful dish, even if it was time-intensive to make. Here are the recipe edits I made using the comments in this thread (with special thanks to Michelle from LA) and saved for myself. \n\nINGREDIENTS //\n4 SERVINGS\n\n8 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs\u00a0 (about 2\u00bd lb.), patted dry\nKosher salt\n2 serrano chiles, coarsely chopped\n1 2\" piece ginger, peeled,\u00a0 chopped\n3 garlic cloves\n\u2153 cup tamarind concentrate\n3 Tbsp. coconut aminos\n2 Tbsp. agave nectar\n2 tsp. ground cinnamon\n1 tsp. ground nutmeg\n\u00bd cup plus 3 Tbsp. fresh orange juice (from about 2 oranges)\n4 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided\n2 medium Japanese sweet potatoes or other sweet potatoes (about\u00a0 1 lb.), scrubbed, sliced into 1/8\"\u20131/4\"-thick rounds\nHalf a bunch collard greens (about 6 oz.), stems removed, leaves cut or torn into bite-size pieces\nJuice from \u00bd lemon\n2 tsp. garlic salt\nFreshly ground black pepper\n\nPREPARATION //\nStep 1\nPreheat oven to 375\u00b0.

For us, mainly this glaze burned in the pan, taking with it the chicken skin and the sweet potatoes (we used the japanese sweet, as directed) took way longer than 10 minutes to cook.  Moreover, I had no problem finding coconut aminos at an organic grocery, but I am unclear as to what the benefit of this is over a quality soy sauce.  Sure, it's a good soy-free, gluten-free alternative - but it's doesn't specifically have much value to my already full pantry.  This recipe did make me feel good about my decision to cancel my subscription to bon appetit.AnonymousVancouver BC2/15/2021This recipe was a lesson for me to read the comments on line in advance. I have never had problems with recipes in Bon Appetit but this one was unexpectedly challenging. I anticipated the inadequate oven time for the sweet potatoes but largely because I've had little success in getting sweet potatoes to crisp up in the oven I opted for 4 yukon gold potatoes sliced thin on a mandolin, oiled and salted and baked for 30 minutes at 400 on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper (flipped over half way through). I took them out before they browned too much and lined the pan over which I placed the chicken. When using a glaze such as this it's important not to heat up the skillet as one normally does to sear chicken skin side down. When I checked after 8 minutes they were scorched black. A warning in advance of this step by the author would have been helpful. Luckily the chicken was salvageable but I had to remove the skin (best part) and reapply some of the remaining glaze before putting in the oven with the potatoes for the final step. Overall, this dish is wonderfully tasty and I will try it again, possibly with the Japanese sweet potatoes!Geoff2/14/2021Nice to know I'm in good company. I, too, found the instructions regarding temperatures and timing off. Ironically, I was leery of the raw collard greens salad, but liked that quite a lot after also adding some lemon.AnonymousBoulder, CO1/30/2021Good flavors. Bad directions. Chicken thighs are fully cooked after 10 minutes of saut\u00e9ing, but then they go in the oven with raw potatoes and cook for another 12 minutes with the potatoes. Even when cut 1/4-inch thick, they are still firm and hard after only 12 minutes of cooking. The directions made me pause when reading through them before starting to cook, but I decided to ignore instincts because I was so excited to try a recipe by one of BA\u2019s new staff members. I\u2019m bummed by this letdown and whatever testing process failed the new team and me at home! KateBrooklyn, NY1/27/2021The timing of this recipe doesn\u2019t make sense. Potatoes, even 1/4\u201d thick, take so much longer than 12 minutes. I cooked the chicken in batches, the first batch burned, the second came out ok after turning down the heat to medium low. I\u2019m about 50 minutes in and increased the oven to 400...waiting on the chicken to come to temp...This recipe really doesn\u2019t match the usual BA stunners, but can\u2019t win them all. AWBoston, MA 1/26/2021This was our second favorite recipe out of the eight, just after the Chicken Salad With Citrus. This only came in second because I am not a fan of sweet potatoes. I did try them (I also tucked in a small yukon gold cooked in the same way) and way preferred the yukon to the sweet. Since this is my personal preference (and I know I'm in the minority here), I give this recipe 5 stars and almost the top of the list out of all eight recipes. The sauce is to die for! I too followed the recipe as written, but did switch to cooking the potatoes and chicken in the oven on a sheet pan. For the people who burnt the sauce, keep an eye on your pan and the heat. I had a little residue in my cast iron pan, and it cleaned right up with baking soda. Switch to the sheet pan for the oven part and you'll be happy. I agree with the reviewer who said the potatoes cooked with  the chicken came out almost confit-like. Combined with the greens, this is a massive hit.AnonymousSan Francisco, Ca1/23/2021I cooked the recipe as it was written and it came out great. I had to cook the thighs 20 minutes in the oven. If your potatoes weren\u2019t done, they were cut too thick.  My potatoes were cut approximately 1/4 of an inch thick. If your chicken skin burned, your pan was too hot when you were crisping the skin on the stove. My husband, who is a very picky eater, love the recipe also. It will be one of my \u201cgo to meals\u201d on a regular basis.E.C.Port St. Lucie, FL1/20/2021Here to offer a dissenting voice. This recipe was amazing, and came out looking just like the magazine pictures! I cooked it exactly as instructed except substituting soy sauce for coconut aminos, and my oven cook time was longer than the 10-12 estimate (but I was using thighs twice as large as called for, so no surprise). The potatoes came out wonderfully flavorful and almost confit-like from the rendered chicken fat and I loved the flavors from the glaze on the chicken. ZachIndiana1/20/2021Note to self: don\u2019t excitedly crack open the mag and cook straight from it without reading the comments first. How on gods green earth do potatoes cook fully in 10 minutes? I read it, questioned it, forged ahead anyway hoping it would work out. Similar to many others the chicken skin with glaze burned to a blackened crisp. Next time I\u2019d try browning thighs first then letting them hang out in the glaze. And getting the potatoes going MUCH earlierAlySeattle1/19/2021Well...I really do like Bon Appetit but this recipe just doesn\u2019t make sense.  How do you cook raw potato on 10-12 minutes in a 375 degree oven.  I knew better but thought I\u2019d just take their word for it.  40 minutes later this meal is still cooking and I\u2019ve got pizza on the way.  Don\u2019t make this folks.... wasted ingredients and time.
