Banana leaves will lend a sweet, slightly floral flavor to the fish while it cooks, but if you can\u2019t find them, wrapping each fish in parchment paper will still keep it from drying out.This recipe was adapted from \u2018The Rise: Black Cooks and the Soul of American Food.\u2019Ingredients8 ServingsCoconut Rice3cups white jasmine rice, rinsed1\u00bdcups unsweetened coconut milkKosher saltSnapper25-lb. or four 2\u00bd-lb. head-on whole fish (such as red snapper or black sea bass), cleaned1lb. package fresh or frozen, thawed banana leaves (optional)Kosher salt1lime, thinly sliced into rounds6garlic cloves, thinly sliced13\" piece ginger, peeled, cut into matchsticks1small handful cilantro sprigs1small handful mint springs2cups unsweetened coconut milkChickpeas and assembly\u00bdcup unsweetened coconut flakes\u00bccup extra-virgin olive oil315.5-oz. cans chickpeas, rinsed2jalape\u00f1os or serrano chiles, seeds removed, finely chopped2garlic cloves, finely choppedKosher salt1tsp. ground coriander1tsp. ground turmericJuice of 1 lemon2Tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar\u00bccup coarsely chopped cilantro\u00bccup mint leaves, torn if largeLime wedges (for serving)PreparationCoconut RiceStep 1Combine rice, coconut milk, and 3 cups water in a medium saucepan, season lightly with salt, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.

Fluff rice with a fork, then cover and keep warm until ready to serve.SnapperStep 3Preheat oven to 400\u00b0. Place each fish on a banana leaf or two (you many need to use a few, overlapping as needed, depending on the size of the fish; you just need to make sure each fish is enclosed when wrapped) or 2\u20134 pieces of parchment paper, depending on the size of the fish. Season fish inside and out with salt, then divide lime rounds, garlic, and ginger over each fish. Stuff cavities with cilantro and mint, dividing evenly. Pour some coconut milk over each fish, then wrap up in banana leaf or parchment to make a packet.Step 4Divide packets between 2 large baking sheets, arranging seam side down, and bake fish just until flesh is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork (open a packet to check), 15\u201320 minutes if using 2\u00bd-lb. fish or 25\u201340 minutes if using 5-lb. fish.Chickpeas and AssemblyStep 5While the fish is roasting, toast coconut in a dry large skillet over medium heat, shaking pan often, until golden brown, about 4 minutes.
