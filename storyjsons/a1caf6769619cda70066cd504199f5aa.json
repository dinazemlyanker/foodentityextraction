JacksonFinally, a hotel that doesn\u2019t feel stiff and sterile, but also isn\u2019t trying too hard to be hip (and the staff is exceedingly friendly). The Line, located in a former historic church in the heart of Adams Morgan, opened its doors in late 2017. It\u2019s been filled with a steady stream of freelancers with laptops during the day, and friends catching up over cocktails and dinner at night. Oh, right, and there are guests, too. The rooms feel a bit like that understated apartment your friend had in college... but more adult.For a casual meal in the high-ceilinged lobby, opt for Brothers and Sisters, from Erik Bruner-Yang of Maketto (get the octopus hot dog). Or, head upstairs to the hyper-locavore A Rake\u2019s Progress, from Baltimore chef Spike Gjerde. It heavily sources ingredients from the Mid-Atlantic\u2014think West Virginia truffle butter and rabbit-stuffed rabbit with potatoes and carrots. Michelle and Barack ate there before it was even open, which you can feel free to say to everyone at the table, every time you go.PRO TIP: You can't eat all your meals under the same (very cool) chandelier. A quick walk away is Tail Up Goat, one of our favorite DC spots. Also check out Lapis Afghan Bistro, which is a good option if you\u2019re eating with a group. (Make reservations ahead at both!)THE DETAILS: Rooms start at $268 per night.Gary WilliamsAdrian GautAdrian GautExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
