But I also love order, consistency, list-making, and organization\u2014controlled abundance, if you will. And that\u2019s why I love my Brother label maker, which provides structure and clarity for the otherwise unruly realms of my pantry, fridge, and spice drawer. With the label maker, the riffraff of my kitchen\u2014homemade dukkah! Preserved radish! Three types of dried chiles! Is that aioli?\u2014makes some sense.One of the reasons why my kitchen is so unruly is because it\u2019s small: To save space, I\u2019m constantly transferring dried goods into smaller containers. Rices and grains get shuttled into jars, and the various flours need their own airtight homes. Sugar goes into a quart container, so the big bag can live elsewhere.Surely I am capable of using my senses to discern what is what. But if you\u2019ve ever accidentally used sugar in place of salt or vice versa, you\u2019ll understand why labels are imperative. The neatly labeled vessels make rifling through the cabinet less of a trudge and more of a jaunt. Instead of wading through mysterious territory, I recognize the landscape at every turn. The labels also help me to keep better track of what I have and what I\u2019m running low on.Of course, you can use Scotch tape, a fine-point Sharpie, and a pair of sharp scissors to the same effect. But while tape is great for marking leftovers and other impermanent passers-through, labels are in it for the long haul. When something gets one, you\u2019ve inducted it into your Kitchen Staples.With my Brother label maker, which was a gift from my sister once she knew how much I admired her spice cabinet, I can customize the fonts, borders, and symbols and buy tapes with different colors and patterns. And you can bet I\u2019ve used them all. You can give a girl a label maker, but you can\u2019t take the chaotic tendencies out of the girl.Brother P-Touch PTM95 Portable Label Maker$25 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendShoppingRead MoreLifestyleThese Bins Keep My Pantry Tidy No Matter How Many Beans I BuyBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
