You\u2019ll find recipes she\u2019s cooking, stories she\u2019s loving, where she\u2019s been eating, and more. It gets better: If you\u00a0sign up for our newsletter, you\u2019ll get this letter before everyone else.We know BA\u2019s Annual Hot 10 is the restaurant guide for many of you. Once the list drops we\u2019ve heard how readers rush to get reservations at the places we highlight, which often changes the financial trajectory of these establishments. We take that responsibility seriously. For much of the last year and a half, however, it simply wasn\u2019t possible to travel to the restaurants that even managed to open, and it certainly didn\u2019t seem like the right time to have them compete against one another for the 10 slots.The time did seem right, though, for us to rethink what it means to be an outstanding restaurant. Of course, it\u2019s about the food\u2014bold flavors, local ingredients, and unexpected preparations. But the pandemic reinforced that restaurants are much more than that\u2014they can inspire, reform, and build community. So this year we asked ourselves, Who is putting others first? Who is making the industry better? We came up with a dozen restaurants, people, and organizations that stood out for their outside-the-box thinking, deep impact, and yes, often their stellar food. These are the Heads of the Table.Our Restaurant Issue also includes a thought-provoking piece on parenting in the industry, as well as recipes from the places making food we dreamt about during lockdown. Collectively, these stories show the ways restaurants innovate even as they struggle. You can see that in the recipes, from the Picarones With Fig Chancaca Syrup, doughnuts made with sweet potato and cardamom, to the Flip Side Pizza sauce, a brew of molasses, black pepper sauce, and tomato paste.In our drinks column, The Pour, you\u2019ll meet Tara Gomez and Mireia Tarib\u00f3, the winemakers behind Camins 2 Dreams. I first encountered their wines last fall at restaurateur Simon Kim\u2019s Cote in New York. Cote\u2019s steaks and Dwen-jang Stew are always memorable, but it was the wine that sommelier Victoria James poured that night that got my attention. Here James shares what makes Camins 2 Dreams so special.Finally, each month I ask notable people who they\u2019d invite for the Dream Dinner Party column. In an issue that highlights the givers, we give chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s the last word.Explore Bon App\u00e9titLetter From The EditorCultureRead MorerestaurantsHeads of the TableBy The Bon App\u00e9tit Staff & ContributorsRecipes you want to make.
