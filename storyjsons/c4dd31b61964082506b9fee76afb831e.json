Must Be Rent Week\u00a0Hash can be good\u2014let me prove it.\u00a0By Alex DelanyNovember 8, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Travis Rainey\u00a0FacebookTwitterEmailYou ever think about life on the ranch? Horses? Lassos? Cowboy hats? Wooden fences? Expansive, star-lit night skies? Cacti? Rattlesnakes? Your faithful cow-herding pup? Crappy coffee in a crappier tin cup? The things on boots that clink and clank? (Ummm...spurs?) Nah, me neither. Well, that\u2019s not true. I think about all of that when I\u2019m making and eating hash, the official food of fictional ranch hands everywhere.So yeah, let\u2019s talk about hash, a perfect Rent Week food. Potatoes. A little bit of meat. Minimal spices. Minimal ingredients. Maximum satisfaction. But I\u2019m not going to beat around the bush. Most hash is pretty terrible. Undercooked potatoes, graying ground meat. Never enough salt, and even fewer aromatics and alliums. For a food with so much potential, it's a chronic under-deliverer.But that\u2019s most hash. That\u2019s not Rent Week hash. This month\u2019s recipe is hash in its finest form. Crispy potatoes and spicy sausage. Sweet onions and garlic. And a little oregano and yogurt to lift it all up. So throw on this Americana playlist I made for you (completely free of charge) and get ready for some ranch-style grub.The first thing to do is get your potatoes cooking:Start with 2 pounds of young potatoes (fingerlings or anything small and waxy will do just fine).Throw them in a large pot and cover them with at least two inches of water. Throw about 1 cup of kosher salt into the water, stir, cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Wait, what? A cup of salt?! Yes, for real. That much salt. Salting your potato water is what will make your spuds actually taste like something. And don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not actually consuming all that salt. Most of it gets left behind in the water.When the water boils, turn the heat down to medium-low and let the potatoes simmer for about 15 more minutes, until they\u2019re soft enough to easily poke through with a fork, but not so soft that they break apart immediately.While the potatoes do their thing, get yourself prepped:Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat.De-case about 1 pound of hot Italian sausage, thinly slice \u00bd of a large white onion (widthwise, in complete circles), and thinly slice 3 cloves of garlic .Now it's time cook the sausage and alliums:Crumble the sausage into small pieces and spread across the hot cast iron.Let it cook undisturbed for about 5 minutes. And when I say undisturbed, I mean undisturbed. Don\u2019t touch it! We want this sausage to get nice and crispy and browned. Flip a piece and see if it\u2019s developed some serious color. If it has, flip the sausage and let it brown on the opposite side. If not, let it go a bit longer.Once the sausage has browned on both sides, transfer it to a bowl with a slotted spoon, leaving behind as much rendered fat as possible.Add the onion rings to the pan, stir to coat them in fat, and cover the skillet with a lid. After about 5 minutes, the onions should have softened a bit. Add the garlic and a sprinkle of kosher salt, stir, and cover the skillet again. Remove the lid and stir the onions and garlic until they're completely tender and have started to pick up some color.Use a slotted spoon to remove the onions and garlic from the skillet and into the same bowl as the sausage, once again leaving behind as much rendered sausage fat as possible.A platter of hash.

It\u2019s nothing personal. Strictly business. Potatoes will get way crispier if you crack them open a bit and expose some of that starchy interior. Use a coffee mug to smash each potato gently. You\u2019re not trying to obliterate them. You just want to smush them gently, until the sides split and the potatoes flatten slightly.Return your skillet to medium heat and add a glug of neutral oil  so the bottom is entirely coated. Add half of the smashed potatoes to the pan in a single layer\u2014you\u2019ll need to fry in two batches, so don\u2019t be tempted to cram them in all at once.Cook the first batch, undisturbed, until golden brown and crisp underneath, about 6\u20137 minutes. Flip the potatoes, add another glug of oil, and continue to cook on opposite side until golden brown and edges are crisp, about 5\u20136 minutes more.Transfer the potatoes back to the sheet tray, add a glug of oil to the pan, and repeat with the second half of the potatoes.While the potatoes fry, pick about \u00bc cup of fresh oregano leaves from the stems and give it a rough chop. Toss the oregano into the bowl with the sausage, onions, and garlic.Once the potatoes have gotten all nice and crispy, season them with a sprinkle of kosher salt and plate half of them across a platter. Layer half of the sausage and onions on top of the potatoes, then repeat with the remaining potatoes and sausage.I like to serve this with some scrambled eggs when I\u2019m feeling especially hungry. Eggs or not, I\u2019ll always add a dollop of Greek yogurt. It\u2019s not necessarily a ranch hand move, but look, I\u2019m not going to push the cowboy references on you any further. You get it: Ranch stuff exists and hash is pretty darn great, whether you\u2019re around a campfire or in the dwelling you pay monthly to live in.Want something a little less...hash-y? How about fried rice?Your Plans Can Wait\u2014Tonight Is For Kielbasa Fried RiceBest eaten alone. On the couch.
