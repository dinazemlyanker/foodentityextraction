It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Short ribs are worth every minuteThere\u2019s this moment when you\u2019re making short ribs\u2014before you\u2019ve braised them but after you\u2019ve browned them\u2014when your house smells like a short-order burger joint and it takes all your willpower to not just stand there and pick at all the crispy nubbins.But be patient. Time changes everything.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!After three hours in a Dutch oven, burbling with wine and stock and chopped-up vegetables, the short ribs transform themselves into something magical. They are why we have clich\u00e9s like fork-tender and fall-off-the-bone.At least that\u2019s what I kept telling myself this past Saturday, one of those cold, damp, dreary afternoons, when the sun disappears at 4:30pm and you\u2019re like, Well, what do I do now?You cook.I bought a few pounds of bone-in ribs and a quart of chicken stock from Dickson\u2019s Farmstand Meats. I grabbed some onions and carrots and garlic from a nearby market and biked home and got to it.These short ribs are slow-roasted in coconut milk.\nAs evidenced by all the short rib recipes on our site, there are plenty of paths to follow. You can go with ginger and soy, or citrus and chile, or\u2014who knew!\u2014coconut milk and lemongrass (pictured above). Or, if you\u2019re like me and just want to keep it old-school, half a bottle of red wine.Regardless of which flavor profile you choose, just do as our essential Basically braising guide instructs, and remember these key steps:These are my seared short ribs before going into the wine and stock mixture.\nPhoto by Adam Rapoport1. In a heavy-bottomed pot, brown the well-salted meat over medium heat and then set aside.\n2. In the same pot, cook down a bunch of vegetables in the remaining fat.3. When the veg is nicely caramelized (you might have to add a splash of water to deglaze the crispy hits on the pan), nestle the meat back in the pot among the veg.4. Pour In a mix of stock and wine. I had a half-finished bottle of red on the counter so I used that. I also had some leftover ramen stock from takeout a few nights prior, so I added that, as well.5. Slide the covered pot into the oven for about 3 hours, after which the short ribs are done. But as the Basically guide illustrates, there\u2019s this extra-credit thing you can do where you strain the braising liquid and then reduce it over medium-high heat till it gets all glossy and syrupy, and I highly recommend this.Ultimately, your house will be the best-smelling place on the block (more restaurant than diner, at this point) and you will be very, very proud of yourself. And you deserve to be. You turned a cold, dark, dreary afternoon into something truly magical.Molly StevensGet the recipes:Red Wine-Braised Short RibsSoy-Braised Short Ribs with ShiitakesCitrus-and-Chile-Braised Short RibsShort Ribs Slow-Roasted in Coconut MilkExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterShort RibBraiseRead MorecookingBraise On!
