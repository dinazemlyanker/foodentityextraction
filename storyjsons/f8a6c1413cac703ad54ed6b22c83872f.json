Pick an eggplant that feels light and airy (it likely has fewer seeds and more flesh, which means maximum creaminess); you can score the cut sides before placing on the grill to decrease the cooking time. \u2014Rachel GurjarAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Good for meatless Mondays!AnonymousPinckney, Michigan8/5/2021For the love of God!!! Veggie Bob!!!! I don't know what Catholic religion you were brought up in or taught but never did or do the Catholics think FISH is VETIGETARIAN!!!!  Fridays and some of the other religious days were meant to be MEAT free NOT FISH free or vegetarian!!!\nThis is a wonderful recipe, get excited again Veggie Bob and omit the FISH SAUCE and substitute Braggs  Aminos!!!! \nChill DUDE!!!\nOh yeah we all make mistakes :)AnonymousPinckney, Michigan8/5/2021This is in the current July 2021 issue of the magazine. I'm a vegetarian; I love eggplant. So I read it with a level of excitement. Then it struck me:\n\n3 Tbsp. fish sauce\n\nThis is not a vegetarian ingredient. Fish is not \"vegetarian\" no matter what your Catholic upbringing may tell you (that's the only source of the idea that fish is vegetarian I know of). If you're going to write recipes for a vegetarian article then make sure they are, indeed, vegetarian.Veggie BobSan Francisco, CA7/16/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titThaiSoutheast AsianAsianEggplantVegetableTomatoThai ChileChileCilantroHerbs & SpicesPeanutNutSummerSideDairy-FreeGluten-FreeKetoGrillingDinnerRecipes you want to make.
