Each week, you\u2019ll hear from one of them, from a farmer in Winters, California, to a wine educator in Chicago. This week\u2019s diarist is Peter Steckler who is finding his footing as a line cook at American Elm in Denver as he experiences the ups and downs of restaurant closures and restrictions.I\u2019m fairly new to the industry. I got my current job as a line cook at American Elm, a neighborhood restaurant in Denver, back in April. I\u2019d say that more than a third of my restaurant experience has come working through the pandemic, and I\u2019ve only been at American Elm during COVID, so I don\u2019t even know what a normal Saturday night looks like here.I know what it\u2019s like when it\u2019s closed for indoor dining, though, and when it\u2019s open at 25 percent and 50 percent. Like everywhere, we\u2019ve experienced a roller coaster of restrictions and closures. We just came out of the last closure, which started in November, and we\u2019re now allowed to have 25 percent capacity. Around the same time, we brought in six heated greenhouses, and we got heaters for every one of our five outdoor tables\u2014we\u2019re blowing through propane\u2014so pretty much overnight we went from having barely anyone at the restaurant to a decent volume between indoor and outdoor. We had 2,894 covers in January 2020. This year we had 2,415. So we\u2019re only down about 16 percent. The neighborhood really supports this restaurant and fills the tables when they\u2019re available.We\u2019re also in the process of applying for the state\u2019s 5 Star certification program. [Editor\u2019s note: The 5 Star State Certification is a program in some Colorado counties that allows businesses like restaurants and gyms to increase their indoor capacity by showing they\u2019re going above and beyond public health orders. In Denver it allows businesses to gradually reopen and increase their capacity after meeting certain guidelines and thresholds.] It\u2019s a brand-new program, so we\u2019re still trying to navigate what we need to do, but we think we may need to space the tables further, focus on customer contact tracing, and improve air ventilation.Since we reopened for indoor dining we\u2019re actively seeking line cooks. We have three to five people in the kitchen during the week and six to seven on the weekends. It\u2019s actually a great time to hire because the market is packed with talent and people need work. But there\u2019s still the uncertainty. It\u2019s winter in Colorado, and while it\u2019s been mild so far, the snowiest and coldest months might be coming. I\u2019m also wondering, \u201cAre we gonna get shut down again?\u201d Every time a new restriction on restaurants comes down, it\u2019s sad and demoralizing in the kitchen, especially considering who the shutdowns affect most. Lower-level line cooks and dishwashers get their hours slashed. I got a promotion over the summer; I\u2019m a higher-level line cook, so I\u2019m not hourly anymore. I feel safe, but I definitely feel some guilt that I have work while others don\u2019t.While I know it\u2019ll be rough for a bit, it\u2019s comforting knowing the owners and management here are committed to keeping the restaurant open and finding new sources of revenue. To do that they\u2019ve tried so many things. The at-home meal kits have been huge\u2014at one point we were doing 500 of these fully cooked packaged meals a week. Back then it was the only way people could \u201ceat out\u201d when they couldn\u2019t actually eat out. Lately, we\u2019ve been doing around 300. And then there\u2019s the takeout and delivery, which I think was a small component for the restaurant in the before times, but now it\u2019s much bigger. And we have another meal kit service that\u2019s more about prepping the ingredients to be cooked at home, and there\u2019s also a smoothie side hustle and a food truck. Each is just another layer for survival, and all these things together can make this job overwhelming.I\u2019m 24 and pretty new to the restaurant business, but working during COVID has made me certain that this is where I want to be. I found something I\u2019m good at. There\u2019s something about executing a good service, communicating with my coworkers, cultivating great experiences for customers\u2014I love it. And this uncertain period is helping me grow. It\u2019s opening my eyes to ways restaurants can be creative and find new revenue streams. A lot of responsibility was thrust upon me because of the circumstances\u2014I\u2019ve been stepping up to help with execution, organization, and fulfillment of the meal kits\u2014but I\u2019ve learned so much.I can\u2019t say if other young people feel the same way. I don\u2019t know the effect this will have on the next generation, and whether or not they\u2019ll be reluctant to join the industry because of how hard-hit restaurants have been. But other industries are getting hit hard, too, not just restaurants. Right now, with the restaurant back open and the outdoor spots filling up and the support we\u2019ve gotten for all of the to-go programs, my coworkers are happy to be here and they\u2019re working so hard. People still want to work in restaurants, and I\u2019m one of them.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsRestaurant DiariesFirst PersonRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
