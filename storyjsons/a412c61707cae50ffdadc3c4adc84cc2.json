A new limited-edition Nike collaboration had been announced on Instagram the day before, and these hypebeasts are lined up to get a piece of it.\u201cI AM THIRSTING AT THESE SNACKS,\u201d commented one enthusiastic follower on the post.\u201cDying!! NEED immediately!!!\u201d\u201cHow I do get a pair? I don\u2019t live in NYC.\u201dThe item they\u2019re there to claim? A pair of Air Force 1 sneakers done up in the signature pink-and-green color scheme and cursive logo of\u2026a matcha tea shop.Since Cha Cha Matcha opened its first location in New York three years ago, the Japanese-inspired tea shop has attracted a loyal customer base of models, influencers, and fashion designers with its $5 lattes and millennial-pink cups. It was one of those frequent customers, designer Virgil Abloh of streetwear brand Off-White, who orchestrated the Nike collaboration last fall. The move was so successful that the shop followed up with limited-edition T-shirts and hoodies designed by Abloh himself, timed to the launch of its Los Angeles shop in December.\u201cI\u2019ve never wanted merch this bad in my life tbh,\u201d wrote a follower on the exclusive drop.It\u2019s been cool to wear restaurant merchandise since the Hard Rock Cafe\u2019s heyday, but this marriage of streetwear and food is new. In the last year alone, KFC launched a collaboration with Nigo, the legendary Japanese streetwear designer; Mission Chinese tapped a Yeezy designer (Lauren Devine) for its casual skate-inspired merch; Los Angeles\u2019 Sqirl, famed for its thick-cut ricotta toast, teamed up with small skate brand Brain Dead on a jar of jam. Dover Street Market sold the fruit spread next to a T-shirt with a bagel for a logo from Palace, a British skate brand.As fashion weeks unfold around the globe this month, luxury fashion houses will be showcasing their big bets on the next trends from London to Paris. But for a certain crowd Stateside, white lace-up Vans made in collaboration with Los Angeles hot spot Jon and Vinny\u2019s carry more cache than any chunky Balenciaga sneaker.So, how did we get here?From the Kith x Sadelle\u2019s capsule collection.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig\u201cWe have a lot of people from the fashion industry that come to the restaurant, and that we are friendly with,\u201d says Sant Ambroeus creative director Alireza Niroomand. Not only has he had a hand in turning the restaurant into the go-to spot for fashion-related meetings in New York, but Niroomand was also one of the first to see collaborations with trending brands like Superga, Oliver Peoples, and Italian windbreaker company K-Way as a natural \u201corganic\u201d fit.\u201cI never sit at my desk and think, Oh, we should collaborate with these people,\u201d Niroomand says. \u201cIt\u2019s never forced.\u201d Neighbors and regulars of the Lafayette Street location come to eat, they get to chatting, and boom, skateboarder Mark Gonzales has his own Sant Ambroeus x Supreme deck. Morgan Collett, cofounder of vibey skate-surf brand Saturday\u2019s NYC, swings by for an espresso, and bada bing! a $125 limited-edition pink crewneck sweatshirt is born.For the restaurant, this isn\u2019t about diversifying its revenue stream. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not a monetary thing,\u201d Niroomand says. Rather, the association with the right and relevant fashion labels \u201celevates the restaurant\u2019s brand in the world that we live in right now, especially with the downtown crowd. It gives it a \u2018cool factor.\u2019\u201dAnd it\u2019s not just upscale restaurants that are tapping into the moment. The tactic has worked just as well for larger mass-market food brands like White Castle (Telfar Clemens) and Coca-Cola (Bathing Ape). Buzzy salad chain Sweetgreen, meanwhile, has been using merch designed by labels like Cult Gaia and Deerdana to make its fast-casual veg-forward meals more fashionable. It started with T-shirts and tote bags featuring punny phrases like \u201cBeets don\u2019t kale my vibe\u201d\u2014a reference to a more explicit lyric from rapper Kendrick Lamar. Then last October, Sweetgreen dropped \u201cBurrata 2020\u201d merch, which was a spoof of Balenciaga\u2019s own Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign spoof.\u201cWe\u2019re a company that celebrates healthy food,\u201d said Sweetgreen cofounder Nicolas Jammet.\n\u201cWe use these fun fashion and music references to engage people even more and create that connection. It\u2019s changing the cultural paradigm of what food is cool, and what people want to associate themselves with.\u201dAnd increasingly, what people want to associate themselves with is restaurants.Pizzaslime\u2019s Erewhon \u201cdrip.\u201d\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig\u201cIf you\u2019re aware of this great spot and you\u2019re repping it, people give a silent nod,\u201d said Matthew Hwang, cofounder of Pizzaslime, a creative agency that aims to make instant \u201cmicromerch\u201d in response to trending pop culture topics. \u201cYou\u2019re part of a smaller, niche group that knows about this food or place.\u201dPizzaslime started as a music blog and eventually made a name for itself with celebrity-related products, like the \u201cDrake Tears\u201d mug that went viral in 2014. Now many of its best sellers revolve around food. In November, Pizzaslime collaborated with Jon and Vinny\u2019s on a plate of fusilli T-shirt. Just this week, the creative agency made merch for an L.A. pop-up event with New York\u2019s much-hyped slice joint Prince Street Pizza. One of its most popular items so far, though, was an unofficial sweatsuit promoting L.A.\u2019s favorite fancy health food store, Erewhon.In April, Kanye West tweeted the photo of someone wearing sweats (purportedly a Yeezy prototype) with the caption, \u201cGrocery story drip Erewhon drip laundry day drip airport drip.\u201d The timing was sweet: Pizzaslime had just dropped their own swag the month before: black and gray Champion sweatsuits with the store\u2019s name written in big orange letters.The sweats sold out almost instantly, with orders shipping all the way to Paris. \u201cDo these people even know what Erewhon is?\u201d wondered Nicholas Santiago, the agency\u2019s other half, of his international customers. \u201cOr is the hype that big?\u201dPerhaps no one understands hype better than Ronnie Fieg, founder of the popular streetwear brand Kith, who\u2019s created limited-edition shirts and hoodies in collaboration with Major Food Group\u2019s swanky Red Sauce restaurant Carbone and upscale Jewish deli Sadelle\u2019s\u2014two Manhattan spots he frequents. But he\u2019s just as likely to tap into his own 1990s nostalgia, as he did with the California Milk Processor Board, when he put his spin on the Got Milk? milk mustaches campaign.But in a climate where labels have to justify their brick-and-mortar existence in an increasingly digital world, he\u2019s also figured out how to use food as a valuable, and often exclusive, IRL experience to get people in the door. Kith Treats, the brand\u2019s in-house cereal/ice cream/milkshake bar, serves 20-something different flavors and toppings curated by everyone from LeBron James to, again, Virgil Abloh.Sure, the sugary treats are all made up of ingredients you can get at the grocery store for half the price\u2014a bowl of The Don, a mix of Cap\u2019n Crunch and coconut flakes curated by streetwear designer Don C, runs you $6.50. And yet all the cool kids wearing Off-White on their backs are willing to shell out in order to spoon their snack out of a disposable Kith-branded bowl.As Fieg well knows: \u201cIt\u2019s all about what you\u2019re willing to wait in line for, right?\u201dEmilia Petrarca is a fashion news writer at New York Magazine\u2019s The Cut, and the proud owner of a Ferrara Bakery \u201cHoly Cannoli\u201d T-shirt.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsFashionRecipes you want to make.
