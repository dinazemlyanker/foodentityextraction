This recipe makes enough syrup for 16 drinks (great for a crowd), but if you have any leftover, there are endless creative ways to use it up. Drizzle over ice cream, use as a sweetener for lemonade or iced tea, mix into gin- or tequila-based cocktails, or even whisk into salad dressings.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.
