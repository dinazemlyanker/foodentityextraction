Even, as a recent test proved, when it\u2019s from the Cheesecake Factory. To me, dumplings are like pizza\u2014I\u2019ll never not eat them, but they don\u2019t always dazzle me. At a recent visit to Nancy\u2019s Hustle, an exceedingly cool bistro in Houston, however, I was beyond dazzled.It played out like anywhere else: I saw lamb dumplings on the menu, and without skipping a beat, I ordered them. It didn\u2019t matter that they were an odd fit with the rest of the dishes on the list\u2014things like pancetta croquettes and cavatelli with duck confit. They arrived chubby pockets of meat generously dressed with this spicy, tangy vinaigrette, dollops of thick labneh, and crisped up bits of garlic. Chef Jason Vaughan says he drew his inspiration from Turkic manti. And let me tell you: I have never housed a plate of dumplings faster. The soft but ever so slightly al dente dumpling skin! The way the vinaigrette-labneh combo beautifully offset the richness of the meat! The intense bursts of garlic! The balance of hot and cold and crunchy and soft! My dining companions didn\u2019t even stand a chance. I loved them so much I ordered them again. And I would have ordered them three more times if I could.I\u2019ll continue to order dumplings, and I\u2019ll continue to enjoy them even if they don\u2019t dazzle. But I\u2019d be lying if I said I won\u2019t be wishing they were these little guys from Nancy\u2019s Hustle.Go there: Nancy\u2019s HustleExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendHoustonRestaurantsDumplingsRecipes you want to make.
