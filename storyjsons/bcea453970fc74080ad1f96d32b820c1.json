Medicinal or citrusy? Whatever your preference, there's a bottle for you.By Al CullitonApril 23, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Laura MurrayFacebookTwitterEmailTired of cocktail recipes that call for expensive, obscure bottles and fancy-pants techniques? We got you. Welcome to Happy Hour with Al, a monthly column where Al Culliton, Basically\u2019s resident bartender, sets you up to get the most bang for your booze with the fewest possible bottles.During this strange and difficult time, when I\u2019m staying in except for weekly grocery shopping, I\u2019ve gained a new appreciation for my liquor cabinet as a passport to far-away places. Today, I\u2019d like to take you with me\u2014and we\u2019re going on a little jaunt to Italy. I\u2019ll put on some Italian pop from the \u201960s\u2014like Mina, Gino Paoli, Ornella Vanoni\u2014and set out a bunch of little glasses, each filled with a different Italian amaro. Suddenly I\u2019ve turned my desk into a caf\u00e9 table on a piazza. The sun\u2019s shining and I\u2019m watching the pigeons peck at crumbs on the cobblestones. Now imagine your fabulous outfit. I\u2019m wearing a vintage knit polo and pleated linen trousers. Put on your shades, hop into my 1965 Giulietta, and let\u2019s go!I\u2019ve mapped out our trip to visit six different Italian regions, each the birthplace of a different amaro. Amari (that\u2019s the plural of amaro) are digestifs, or digestivi in Italian, meant to be consumed after dinner, and can range from low-ABV (around 15%) to the ABV of a regular spirit (45%). Amari originated in the medieval monasteries of what is now modern-day Italy, where monks created healing and soothing tonics using roots, herbs, flowers, and spices. Amaro means \u201cbitter\u201d in Italian, and that quality pulls the whole category under one broad umbrella, though the level of bitterness can vary wildly. An amaro can be citrusy, herbaceous, floral, coniferous, medicinal, vegetal, earthy, savory, and so on. These flavors are imparted through the process of maceration and/or distillation of botanicals in wine or a grain spirit, followed often by blending and resting to synthesize the elements. Italians typically drink amaro neat after dinner, but you\u2019ll learn a few other ways to enjoy it as we make our journey.The great thing about amaro is that all of the different personalities in the category make it a lot of fun to explore. If you\u2019re not an expert in spirits, amaro might just be an ideal starter category for you. Unlike bourbon or Scotch, you don\u2019t have to be an experienced spirits taster to understand the differences between the subcategories or individual products\u2014they\u2019re all quite distinctive. So let\u2019s hit the road:Fernet-Branca: Minty, Medicinal, DivisiveWe\u2019re going to start out in Milan with something bracing and strong. A lot of people think that fernet is a brand, but it\u2019s actually a subcategory within amaro (Fernet-Branca, however, is a specific brand of popular fernet). Fernet is characterized by deeply bitter flavors, and sits at the high end of the ABV scale. The category\u2019s flavor profile is medicinal (think aloe and eucalyptus) with intense menthol qualities. Because of its strong flavor profile, most people love it or hate it. But if you love it, you\u2019ll love it forever (like I do).The \u201cferrari\u201d is equal parts Fernet-Branca and Campari.\nPhoto by Laura MurrayBr\u00e0ulio: Coniferous, Alpine, AffableLet\u2019s head northeast from Milan to the town of Bormio in the Alps to meet my favorite amaro of all time, Br\u00e0ulio. (Probably the only brand to which I\u2019d happily plead \u201csponsor me!\u201d) Ask any of my friends and they\u2019ll tell you that I serve it after dinner, drink it with espresso, and use it alongside rye in Old-Fashioneds and Whiskey Sours. Technically, Br\u00e0ulio is part of a larger category of alpine amari, but it\u2019s the only example of the genre that\u2019s easy to find in the U.S. Br\u00e0ulio exhibits flavors that play into the terroir of the region, pulled from pine, rosemary, juniper, and mountain roots and flowers. What you end up with is notes of spearmint, conifer and white flowers.Sfumato Rabarbaro: Smoky, Fruity, DarkHeading southeast from Bormio, we\u2019re off to Aldeno in the region of Trentino. Fans of Mezcal and peaty Scotch will enjoy Sfumato Rabarbaro, an amaro from Distilleria Cappelletti. Rabarbaro is a subcategory of amaro made from the root of Chinese rhubarb, which gives it a smoky quality that comes not from how it\u2019s made but from the plant itself. If you prefer more mild smoky flavors, the Milanese amaro Zucca is a bit gentler than Sfumato and gives you citrus notes and cardamom, too.Combine equal parts Br\u00e0uilo and Sfumato Rabarbaro and magic happens.\nPhoto by Laura MurrayCynar: Earthy, Herbaceous, VersatileJump back into the car and let\u2019s head to Venice, the birthplace of Cynar (though it\u2019s now produced by Milan-based Gruppo Campari). Cynar is the most famous and widely available carciofo, another subcategory defined around a key ingredient. This time it\u2019s artichokes! It\u2019s a delicious amaro with a savory, vegetal earthiness that amplifies its bitterness. This one\u2019s low on the ABV spectrum at just 16.5%, which might be why it\u2019s at home for both aperitivo and digestivo, i.e. before or after dinner.Try 1 oz. Cynar plus 1 oz. Laird's Applejack brandy.\nPhoto by Laura MurrayAmaro dell\u2019Erborista: Bitter, Complex, ChallengingAnd speaking of bitterness, we\u2019re going to go for the strong stuff as we drive south to Muccia, just an hour inland from the Adriatic coast. There, the fantastic Distilleria Varnelli produces one of the most bitter amari available, Amaro dell\u2019Erborista. With notes of warming spice, dried fruit, and honey, it\u2019s the perfect thing to drink after a big meal and it\u2019s unfiltered, giving it a cloudy appearance and some sediment in the glass. The botanicals are fire-roasted before maceration, lending it a subtle smoky quality. (This distillery also produces excellent liqueurs, like their famous anisette, L\u2019anice Secco Speciale.)Make a Little Ripper with Cynar, Meletti, or Averna.\nPhoto by Laura Murray, Food Styling by Rebecca Jurkevich\u00a0Averna: Citrusy, Coca-Cola-Esque, BalancedFinally, we head all the way down to Sicily to try some Averna. This not-too-bitter amaro shows a pronounced flavor of orange peel along with vanilla and cola notes. It\u2019s not part of any specific family of amari, but that combination of citrus and spice is common in many amari with light-to-medium bitterness. The citrus influence typically comes from bitter orange peels, and that flavor is often paired with spice notes of clove, cinnamon, chocolate, and root beer, among others. Other great examples of this loosely-defined group are Amaro Ciociaro and Ramazzotti. If you want to start out even lighter, I\u2019d recommend the gentle, herbal Amaro Nonino or Amaro Montenegro. Our own Alex Delany calls Montenegro \u201cTSA\u201d, The Starter Amaro.Well, we\u2019ve certainly added a few stamps to our amaro passports today. If you\u2019re looking to branch out from neat pours, may I suggest the easy 1 oz. to 1 oz. mixtures below? They\u2019ve been my go-to at home for the last few months, and the possibilities are endless\u2014plus, there\u2019s no way you can screw these up! Choose an amaro and pour 1 oz. into a small glass. Then search your liquor cabinet (maybe you\u2019ve got Mezcal or Irish whiskey?) or fridge (that open bottle of vermouth or sherry?) and add 1 oz. of whatever you find to the amaro you poured. (You can even mix two amari together!) These are great with or without ice, and you can garnish with an orange slice, lemon twist, or Luxardo cherry if you like, but it\u2019s not at all necessary. Here are a few 50/50 combos I love:Fernet-Branca + CampariSfumato Rabarbaro + Br\u00e0ulioAmaro dell\u2019Erborista + Carpano Antica vermouthCynar + Laird\u2019sGarnish equal parts Amaro dell\u2019Erborista and Carpano Antica vermouth with a Luxardo cherry.\nPhoto by Laura MurrayAnd if you\u2019re looking for a more complex cocktail, here are three easy ways to add dimension to your favorite cocktails with amaro:Amaro Old Fashioned: 1\u00bd oz. aged rum + \u00be oz. amaro (try Sfumato) + 1 barspoon simple syrupAmaro Sour: 1\u00be oz. rye + \u00be oz. amaro (try Br\u00e0ulio) + 1 oz. lemon juice + \u00bd oz. simple syrupBlack Manhattan: 2 oz. bourbon + 1 oz. amaro (try Averna or Cynar)Cin cin!Al Culliton is a writer, bartender and consultant living in western Massachusetts.
