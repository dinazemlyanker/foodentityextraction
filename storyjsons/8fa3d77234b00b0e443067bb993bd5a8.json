Sharma says: \"Whenever I make popcorn chicken or fry larger serving pieces, I flavor the dish in stages. The whole spices are toasted to activate their oils. These are then blended into buttermilk to create a savory marinade. More seasoning is then added to the flour in the dredging mixture, and finally, the hot little nuggets of chicken are topped with fried chiles.\"Season by Nik Sharma with permission by Chronicle Books, 2018.Ingredients4\u20136 servingsSeeds from 4 green cardamom pods (about \u00bc tsp. seeds)2tsp. coriander seeds2tsp. cumin seeds\u00bctsp. whole black peppercorns2cups buttermilk\u00bccup fresh lime juice2\u20133serrano chiles, coarsely chopped6scallions, roots removed, coarsely chopped11\" piece fresh ginger, peeled, chopped4garlic cloves25curry leaves, preferably fresh, divided1Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. kosher salt1\u00bdtsp. cayenne pepper, divided2lb. skinless, boneless chicken breasts, patted dry, cut into 1\" pieces2cups all-purpose flour1tsp. baking powder\u00bdtsp. baking sodaNeutral oil (for frying; about 4\u20136 cups)4green Thai chiles, seeded if desiredSpecial EquipmentA spice mill or mortar and pestlePreparationStep 1Heat a dry small skillet over medium-high.
