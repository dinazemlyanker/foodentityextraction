It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Nice to vitamin C youGetting sick is not on my to-do list.The risk is real. The subway is a rolling sick ward. People are sniffling in meetings and talking about work things with hoarse, gravelly voices. Children are coughing, sometimes on me. I\u2019m going on a work trip tomorrow\u2014to Italy, no less!\u2014and Molly Baz, my colleague and traveling companion, just announced that her husband has doctor-verified flu. He\u2019s in quarantine at home and their puppy is being wiped down several times a day with antibacterial wipes, but still\u2014we\u2019re terrified! There\u2019s a lot of mozzarella that I\u2019m supposed to eat while I\u2019m there, and I need all of my strength.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Whenever I feel exposed and vulnerable, I turn to food to fix everything. After getting my flu shot last week, I ran straight to the closest bodega for all of the fruits I needed for this salad: oranges, grapefruit, mango, kiwi, and a bottle of fresh carrot juice too. This big bowl of sunshine was specifically formulated to supercharge the human system: citrus and tropical fruits are loaded with vitamin C, which is a legendary antioxidant and all-around don\u2019t-get-sick-idant. It\u2019s also got chiles in it\u2014did you know they have a lot of C? True story. There\u2019s a dash of turmeric and fresh ginger for their anti-inflammatory powers and carrot juice for full vegi-fication.Photo by Ted CavanaughBut there\u2019s another reason why I love this salad, and it\u2019s the colorful juiciness of it all. I\u2019ve had some fantastically sweet and juicy satsumas and cara cara oranges in the past month, and love the sharp sourness of a regular white grapefruit too. Poke around for blood oranges, clementines, and Ruby Red grapefruits next time you go shopping. Always store your citrus in the fridge, then cut away the peel and slice into any big-bite-size shape you want (they don\u2019t have to be rounds). Winter, the darkest season, is saved by citrus, so when you have a second, thank Florida and California from the bottom of your salad bowl.Mangoes will continue ripen after being picked, so it\u2019s okay to buy one still firm, but make sure it is fragrant at the stem end\u2014it\u2019s the best indication that you\u2019ve got a potential winner on your hands. They ripen at room temperature, so when it\u2019s tender, it\u2019s ready. Tommy Atkins are readily available, but if you see other varieties like Ataulfo or Champagne mangoes, try them (they\u2019re less fibrous, extremely aromatic, and the flesh is very silky).If kiwis aren\u2019t your thing, stay on the tropical journey and substitute ripe pineapple instead. Whatever you do, don\u2019t skip the drizzle of vegetal olive oil and topping of flaky salt, which will just make the sweet taste sweeter. And most importantly: Don\u2019t. Get. Sick. There\u2019s too much to do.Get the recipe:Vitamin C Superfruit SaladExplore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterCitrusRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
