And when it\u2019s cold, big red wines full of tannins and structure and jammy fruit are what you should pour. But I\u2019ll let you in on a secret: That\u2019s all wrong.Ros\u00e9 is good in July...because ros\u00e9 is good whenever. But ros\u00e9 is best in (drums roll, ears turn, butts move to the edge of their seats) winter. Yes that\u2019s right, winter is the real season for ros\u00e9. Let me explain.My ros\u00e9 consumption reaches its peak in February, and it\u2019s not because I\u2019m holed up in my apartment drinking any more than I usually do. It\u2019s because ros\u00e9 is exhilarating. During a season that\u2019s more or less an emotional nap, I don\u2019t want a glass of bold, hearty red that doubles as a lullaby. I want a drink that\u2019s going to lift me up. I want a lovely, fruit-filled, tantalizingly acidic, assertive slap across the face. And that\u2019s what ros\u00e9 gives me.There\u2019s no problem pink bubbles can\u2019t solve.\nPhoto by Emma Fishman, Food styling by Yekaterina BoystovaI\u2019m talking the feeling I get from a bottle of Bichi winery\u2019s Rosa, a Mexican still ros\u00e9 made from a mystery grape (seriously, the farmer doesn\u2019t even know what it is) that radiates a warming seaside sunshine. The vibe from La Lunotte\u2019s Printemps, a Loire Valley Gamay that brings a hint of tannic structure in a charming, rough-around-the-edges, wild-countryside-fruit type of way. Or the jolt of Villa Calicantus\u2019s Sollazzo, an effervescent biodynamic red blend from the Veneto region of Italy. There is nothing bubbly pink wine cannot snap you out of. I know, I\u2019ve done the research.Specific bottles aside, I\u2019d pour any ros\u00e9 that\u2019s ruby-ish in color, midweight in body, high in acid, and that brings notes of blackberry, raspberry, and stone fruit to the table. Because you won\u2019t find these same characteristics in the much lighter, pinker Provence-style ros\u00e9s, save the stuff you picture drinking by the pool in The Hamptons for actual summer.Until then, put down the Barolo. Leave the Cabernet at home. Skip the Malbec section of the menu. You\u2019ve got the brunt of the harsh, frigid winter in front of you. Drink ros\u00e9.Explore Bon App\u00e9titGlass Half FullWineRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
