Pass. Big Slab of Seared Cheese? That\u2019s More Like ItThis summer I\u2019m skipping the homemade veggie burgers. Instead, I\u2019m putting a slab of seared cheese between two buns and calling it a sandwich.By Sarah JampelJuly 26, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t love veggie burgers\u2014I have a soft spot for Dr. Praeger\u2019s and am in a long-distance relationship with NYC\u2019s Superiority Burger. It\u2019s just that, as 2020\u2019s summer-that-wasn\u2019t hammered home, these hot, glorious months are precious and short. In that context it\u2019s hard to feel like measuring out 100 ingredients (one of which is cooked quinoa; one of which is baked sweet potato; one of which is cooked black beans boiled from dry with kombu and bay leaves) into a food processor, shaping patties, and *praying* that they hold together in the pan is worth all the trouble. I\u2019ll leave that to the Good Doctor!You know what won\u2019t fall apart? You know what\u2019s one ingredient? You know what\u2019s going to be satisfying and well-seasoned even if I leave out that random half teaspoon of ground flaxseed? Cheese! Specifically Halloumi. Halloumi is a Cypriot cheese, also enjoyed in Turkey, Greece, and around the Middle East (and the world!), that has a very high melting point. That means you can grill, roast, broil, pan-fry, or sear it without compromising its structure. Instead, the outside turns crisp and richly golden while the interior gets creamy and soft. Like a breaded and pan-fried slab of tofu or a crispy, cheese-filled mushroom, Halloumi can absolutely hold its own between two buns.It\u2019s not only firm but also appealingly salty and tangy, entirely distinct from milky, buttery paneer and mild mozzarella\u2014a happy companion to juicy, sweet ingredients, like watermelon and figs. In this recipe, it\u2019s paired with seared zucchini because, if we\u2019re being real, summer squash has a tendency to be bland, boring, and watery. But when you brown it, marinate it, and layer it with basil, pickled jalape\u00f1os, and that beautiful slab of warm, squeaky, salty Halloumi, the whole thing adds up to a wholly satisfying, low-maintenance vegetarian sandwich. To my mind, it\u2019s also the equivalent of eating, like, three or four mozzarella sticks\u2014which is to say, you\u2019ll have plenty of room left for sundaes afterwards.So hold your bean burger. I\u2019ll take a cheese burger, please.Get the Recipe:Seared Squash and Halloumi BurgersThis vegetarian recipe makes a strong case for replacing a veggie burger with a slab of melty, salty cheese.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingFarmers Market ChallengeHalloumiCheeseVeggie BurgerRecipes you want to make.
