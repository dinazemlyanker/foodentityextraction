It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Grain trustThis week\u2019s underdog recipe combines a few of my favorite things: whole grains, bulk bin shopping trips, and presents.We published Nutty Grain and Oat Bars in the January 2014 inaugural Healthyish issue, except we called it \u201cThe New Healthy\u201d then\u2014that\u2019s how long ago it was! The recipe was conceived from the start as a celebration of whole grains, and has strong supporting roles from raw nuts, various manner of seeds, Medjool dates, and the notorious bitty grain, amaranth. You pack everything into a loaf pan, then bake it into a dense, chewy, grain-and seed-packed brick, which can then be sliced into the best homemade granola bars you\u2019ve ever had.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!The grain and oat mixture is bound together by a delicious glue made from mashed Medjool dates (high in fiber and potassium) that are simmered in maple syrup (uh\u2014plant based!) until they practically dissolve. When I first tasted the recipe, the dates and maple made the final results a tad too sugary. The bars were also crumbly, which senior food editor at the time Dawn Perry surmised she could fix by applying many pounds of pressure to compress the mixture into the loaf pan before baking.The next time I tried these, Dawn had adjusted the amount of date-maple glue and was ready to show off the effects of her patented packing and pressing technique. The bars were a wall-to-wall bounty of grains, nuts, and seeds. The slices were lightly bound by the sweet mash, toasty-tasting from a 45-minute bake time, and sturdy enough to slice \u00bd-inch thick without breakage. We had a winner. They were the greatest granola bars I had ever had. I took a print-out of the recipe home so I could make them over the weekend.I didn\u2019t have a potato masher at home, which is what Dawn had called for to turn the cooked date mixture into a puree, so I did what any confident home cook should do\u2014I improvised. I scraped the mixture into a quart container and then used my immersion blender to smooth it out. That worked, so we added guidance to that effect to the final version of the recipe. I knew how important it was to pack and press and press and pack, but my valiant efforts at home yielded a loaf that still had little air pockets inside, which made it hard to slice. Nevertheless, it tasted just as good as the one I had had at work.I\u2019ve made The Bars at least a dozen times since. I\u2019ve made them for nursing women (they\u2019re nutrient dense, and nursing women need calories!) and I\u2019ve given them as hostess gifts. I\u2019ve made them for new neighbors and for friends in mourning. I even sent a loaf to my mother-in-law when she was going through chemo and didn\u2019t have much appetite (she needed calories, too). The finished loaf will hold for days on days, so it\u2019s great to pack and ship, or wrap and gift. Maybe this is making me sound like a thoughtful and generous person. I\u2019m not, really. Every time I made one to give, I doubled the recipe so we\u2019d have one at home, too. It\u2019s very affirming for me when others benefit from my selfishness.Here are a few key pieces of wisdom and guidance I\u2019ve picked up along the way:\u2022 Double the recipe and make someone happy in addition to yourself (or, freeze the second loaf and make yourself happy some other time).\u2022 Shop for the oats, nuts, and seeds in the bulk bin aisle of your neighborhood health food store or your preferred grocery store. Generally speaking, you\u2019ll pay less per pound than if you buy them in pre-packaged quantities.\u2022 If you don\u2019t have amaranth, use millet, or just increase either of the seeds by 2 Tbsp. and leave the amaranth out.\u2022 Make sure your date-and-maple mixture is very, very smooth before combining it with the oats, nuts, and seeds. The recipe says \u201cas smooth as possible,\u201d but some people will use that as a cop-out when their arm gets tired. If there are pieces of dates still visible, you need to do better (try the immersion blender trick!).\u2022 Finally, devote several minutes to compressing the mixture into the loaf pan. Because it\u2019s hot and a little sticky at that stage (from the molten date glue), I put a sheet of lightly greased parchment paper onto the surface before I start. Then, with the loaf pan on my counter, I get on my step ladder (for leverage; I\u2019m short), and exert myself in a tricep-heavy, push-up-esque series of see-saw movements to smash everything down, down, down. I use my hands, I use a spatula, I use my balled-up fists, and I don\u2019t give up until it feels like the mixture has fused into one solid mass.Oh, also: a couple of slices, toasted, with cream cheese on top, is a killer breakfast. I\u2019ve made them enough times to know.Get the recipe:Nutty Grain and Oat BarsExplore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
