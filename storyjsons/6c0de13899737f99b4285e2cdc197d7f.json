Skip that entire process by roasting a kabocha squash whole, then tearing the cooked flesh into pieces to roast again under a fragrant and slightly spicy glaze. The result is tender squash with a sticky-sweet sheen in boats of crispy skin. If you want to work ahead, roast the whole squash a day before you need it and store it in your refrigerator; before serving, simply tear the squash, drizzle it with glaze, and pop it back into the oven for the final roast.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

However, my squash dried out so badly.  Rather than being soft, it broke apart in dried up chunks.    I wish I could see all the reviews to determine if others had this issue and what they did.LynnSOshkosh, WI2/1/2022I took Angela's advice and didn\u2019t cook it as long on the first bake which worked well.I thought the recipe called for too much vanilla. I wonder if you could use Trader Joe's chili oil and just add the maple syrup. I did think the sweet and spicy flavors worked well with the squash.SueDenver 1/19/2022Flavors were really good,  but I found that the squash cooked much faster than the time listed in the recipe.  This meant my squash got really soft and it was impossible to tear the squash apart and have it sit upright to roast again as instructed. It also meant the skins were too soft to separate, but not really that great to eat with the super soft flesh and it ended up looking like kind of a mess. I would try this recipe again, but I would reduce the initial roasting time. Angela SkradeMinneapolis, MN 12/5/2021Perfection! Tasty balance of sticky sweet and spice. Texture of this particular squash is velvety and not stringy or chalky.
