As Nicole Ponseca and Miguel Trinidad write in I Am a Filipino: And This is How We Cook, adobo originated as a preservation technique and \u201ccan be broadly defined as anything cooked in vinegar. [\u2026] Depending on the region, the province, the city, or even the cook, the dish changes due to the Philippines\u2019 own ocean-to-farm-to-table foodways.\u201d To make adobo, which can be wet (very saucy) or dry (crispier and less soupy), pork, chicken, tubers, vegetables, squid, lamb, shrimp, or even duck, is simmered in vinegar, often with soy sauce, black peppercorns, and bay leaves. This recipe channels the same flavors of bright vinegar and dark soy sauce, using eggplant as the base, with the addition of ground pork for extra richness. Although this dish will work well with any eggplant, try it in late summer when they reach their peak at the farmers market. Serve alongside plenty of steamed rice to sop up all the sauce.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

It's super delicious. One of my favorite cooking methods: adobo!!!AngelAlbania 1/29/2022I make this recipe with vegetarian sausage and it is heaven. AnonymousCleveland Ohio12/10/2021Second time ever cooking with eggplants (they're intimidating okay!) and I was not disappointed. This recipe is a gem, except for the portion size. I did not make nearly enough for how delicious it was, and how much the fam loved it.TaylaAlexandria, VA11/23/2021Thank you Sohla!\nIf I had that in a Restaurant, I wld say \u201cI HAVE to learn how to make this!\u201d Everyone loved it and said-make this again!\nI crisped smoked bacon, cooked the garlic chips in that, set aside, then browned the eggplant with a little more oil. I used one cup of water per comments. Cut the sugar to 1/2 T. Simmered a few minutes w 2extra bay leaves, vinegar and soy. Then added eggplant for 10 min. Superb!VintagebabeChicago 10/23/2021This is way better than any adobo I've made and I'm Filipino. \n\nThe only alterations to the recipe I did:\n- I used sliced pork belly instead since that's what I had. \n- I added string beans (sitaw) as I wanted to be a vegetable heavy dish. It's also a common Filipino dish, Adobong Sitaw. Cut them 2in length.\n- I ran out of coconut vinegar and used sherry vinegar instead. \n\nPERFECTION!! The sauce was perfectly balanced. I followed the simmer time and the sauce was thicker, just the way I like it. Andy PieFairfield's CA10/6/2021Really, really good. I added a touch of fish sauce to round out the flavor. Also I doubled the recipe and doubled the amount of pork to make it a main dish. Excellent and will be making this again.AngelaSF Bay Area7/20/2021Loved this recipe! Doubled it so we could have leftovers. I subbed pressed tofu + fish sauce for the pork and that worked well. The sauce never really got \u201csilky\u201d maybe because I didn\u2019t have any animal fat in there, but it was delicious with lots of rice! This will definitely become a repeat dish for us. MargotHollis, ME5/2/2021This was great, though very sweet especially the longer it stat on the stove (so when I went back for seconds) . Will probably do a bit less sugar next time. I also did half a pound of ground pork because that's what I had. For two people, maybe not the biggest meal. CharlotteLos Angeles, CA 2/7/2021Great flavor overall, and loved the special little crispy garlic chips for texture and crunch! I used 8 oz ground turkey bc it\u2019s what I could find, and it was delicious! Did the full amount of water and time, and it was great, not too mushy, perhaps because I used Japanese eggplant. The only thing is that it didn\u2019t get sticky and caramel-y like it looks in the photo...maybe needed to add a little more sugar or cook even longer? I also will probably only use one bay leaf next time. Otherwise really yummy! KPOakland12/11/2020This is soooo good - I\u2019ve made it twice now, once with Italian eggplant and once with Chinese. It was much better with Chinese, and I probably wouldn\u2019t make this if I couldn\u2019t find them. I used ground veal because I couldn\u2019t find ground pork and it was great. Will be making again!AnonymousPhiladelphia, PA12/11/2020I've made this twice already, without deviating from the recipe. I'm not usually a fan of eggplant (I'm using italian, that's all I can find), but here I enjoy the mushy texture folks in the reviews are trying to avoid, so I simmer for the full 20-25 mins. It's super good, I'll be making it again and again.Paula P\u00e9rezSpain11/29/2020Lol I just bought 9 aubergines since the recipe says you need about 3 (doing the recipe x3) but it turns out 4 average aubergines is about 3 lb. Don't make the same mistake! Looking forward to a tasty dinner though SiiriLondon, UK11/22/2020I'm going to try this recipe, and instead of pork, I will be using vegan sausage or just the Japanese Eggplants I have growing in my garden!Alice GoodloeLong Beach, CA11/3/2020Made this with double the pork (8 oz) and only 3 italian eggplants (they were large), plus rice vinegar instead of coconut vinegar. It was delicious! Everyone loved it. Next time I'll skip on the garlic chips, though. AnonymousBoston10/28/2020I wanted to make this recipe tonight but it looks like the recipe disappeared?
