The famed French peasant dish of white beans, silky duck confit, and rich ragout topped with a golden breadcrumb crust can take three days and nearly half a dozen pork products to make. It\u2019s an occasion to break out the biggest pot you own, and I can\u2019t think of another recipe that\u2019s more fun to share with family and friends. Our classic version takes no shortcuts and requires a little planning, but every step is totally doable, even if you\u2019re not a pro.First things first: As food director Carla Lalli Music advises, you can divide and conquer. Tag-team with your most ambitious cook friends. One makes the duck, another tackles the ragout and beans. Whoever has the biggest table hosts, and assembly is a group event. Then open a few of bottles of wine and hang out until it\u2019s time to feast.But if you\u2019re delving in yourself, here\u2019s how to break it down, with some tips and tricks along the way. Sure, you need to spread the work out over three days, but the active cooking time is something closer to three hours, and no step requires advanced techniques. Here\u2019s how to do it.Beans ready to cook.\nPhoto by Alex LauOne-Stop ShoppingCassoulet requires a few ingredients you won\u2019t find in the typical supermarket. Save yourself from searching all over town and head to D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s website, where you can order French Tarbais beans, precooked garlic sausage, and Moulard duck legs. Just don\u2019t leave this for the last second.Two Days AheadSoak the beans overnight.Soaking beans before you cook them ensures a faster cooking time on the other end. Yes, there\u2019s a shortcut we endorse, but you\u2019ve already decided to make cassoulet, so you might as well do it the right way. Cover your Tarbais, corona, or cannellini beans with several inches of cold water and refrigerate overnight. (They may start to sprout or ferment if your kitchen is too warm.) Tarbais beans are traditional in this dish, prized for their thin-but-resilient skins and creamy texture. Authentic ones grow in France\u2019s Tarbes region and can get pricey, but both corona and cannellini make fine substitutes.Beans all flavored and tender.\nPhoto by Alex LauCure the duck legs.The duck legs need at least 12 hours to cure, but lucky for you the process is easy, requiring just a lot of salt and waiting time.One Day AheadConfit the duck legs.Confit duck legs are a gift that keeps on giving in this dish: The rich meat gets pulled off the bone, the rendered fat is used to saut\u00e9 the sausages and breadcrumbs, and the skin gets crisped up to crumble on top at the very end.Confit complete.\nPhoto by Alex LauCook the beansAll the aromatics, veg, and herbs\u2014cloves, carrots, onion, garlic, thyme, and a bay leaf\u2014flavor the beans as they cook. Not to mention that there\u2019s a thick piece of pancetta in there, too. While the beans are simmering away, you can move on to the next part.Shred that duck.\nPhoto by Alex LauMake the ragout.This is your final step for the day. And again, it\u2019s pretty hands off. You\u2019re browning your pork shoulder and then letting it slowly become fork-tender in liquid. Once that\u2019s done and cooled, you simply mix in the beans with some of their delicious bean liquid. Save what you don\u2019t use! You might need it for moisture later if the cassoulet is looking dry as it cooks.Ragout and beans ready to be mixed.\nPhoto by Alex LauThe Day OfPrep the sausage and the breadcrumbs.Remember that duck? You\u2019re going to cook the skin from it first so that it gets all crispy and the fat renders out. Then you\u2019re going to use that fat to cook your sausages. Lastly, you\u2019re going to toast your breadcrumbs in the same pan, same fat. Pretty genius, right?That duck skin. Damn.\nAlex LauLayering away.\nPhoto by Alex LauLayer cassoulet.It goes like this: one-third of ragout mixture, half of the sausage and duck meat, another third of the ragout mixture, remaining sausages and duck meat, then remaining ragout mixture. Sprinkle most\u2014but not all!\u2014of the breadcrumbs on top.Get the juices flowing.\nPhoto by Alex LauBake cassoulet.You\u2019re baking at 375\u00b0 for 25-30 minutes at a time, a total of six times. In between each of those, you repeatedly break up the top layer with the back of a spoon and add more breadcrumbs before it goes back in the oven. This fuses the starchy beans and breadcrumbs with fat and gelatin from the meats, creating a deeply flavorful topping. After the final layer of breadcrumbs is added, you\u2019ll serve with the ultimate garnish: Crumbled, crispy duck skin.Get the recipe:Classic CassouletLayers of duck, two kinds of sausage, a hearty ragout, and beans make this the comfort meal to end all comfort meals. It\u2019s an occasion to break out the biggest pot you own. Our classic cassoulet recipe takes no shortcuts and requires a little planning, but every step is totally doable, even if you\u2019re not a pro.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titFrenchCasseroleWeekendRead MorecookingHow to Cook Dried Beans (the Tastiest Beans of All, if You Ask Us)By Alex DelanyRecipes you want to make.
