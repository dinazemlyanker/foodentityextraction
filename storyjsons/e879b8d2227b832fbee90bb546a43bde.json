I\u2019ve just missed my connecting flight out of Charlotte and I\u2019m stuck in the airport for another four hours until the next plane leaves. But who even knows if I\u2019ll get on that one\u2014I\u2019m on stand-by. I am hungry. I am in need of joy. I have grown bored of overpriced airport food. So I scan the terminal map for the only thing acceptable in my time of need: A Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte.Ever since August, when the tour for my first cookbook Dappled began, I\u2019ve been playing a game with myself: How many ridiculous drinks I can order without feeling the shame of false purism? As a pastry chef (until recently at Fiona in L.A., previously with Gjusta) and a former competitive barista (with Intelligentsia), I spent years ordering under self-imposed austerity. At coffee shops, it\u2019s just a cappuccino or a small coffee. In restaurants, I try not to ask for too much. I order the food from the menu as the chef suggests always, showing my respect for the hard-working cooks. I never ask for special treatment. I never take up too much space. I seek to avoid being perceived as needy or fussy, and least of all, unsophisticated. It\u2019s what you learn to do as someone who works in the \u2018farm-to-table,\u2019 \u2018natural,\u2019 \u2018organic\u2019 food space. Maybe it\u2019s something I do as a woman, a fat woman, to make myself feel smaller and more deserving.To request an over-the-top specialty drink with a long list of directives scribbled on the side of the cup, right there next to my name\u2014my real name!\u2014feels out of character. And honestly, it\u2019s fucking liberating. I gleefully rattle off my order to the kind-faced woman in the hunter green apron, who doesn\u2019t even flinch at my needy list of wants and needs: an iced cold brew, tall, unsweetened, extra ice, extra pumpkin cream cold foam, splash of milk. Also, a protein plate because I am, in fact, hungry. In the Reagan Airport a few days later, I order a half sweetened, tall, blonde pumpkin spice latte for dessert. It\u2019s really good, and yes, it\u2019s so extra that it feels like a real treat, exactly what I need.The Starbucks in the airport is my chance to order an inexplicably fussy beverage with multiple modifiers. It\u2019s my chance to taste something that years of working in elite eateries taught me was forbidden. It\u2019s my chance to transgress. Here, I can be relaxed and demanding. I can be the woman who actually does enjoy the seasonal flavors of cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger mixed into holiday orange pumpkin goop, pumped from a jug, blended with espresso, milk, and adorned with whipped cream and a dash of pumpkin pie spice.I love a PSL, and I am no longer ashamed to admit that. Culinary police, arrest me: I\u2019m basic.Explore Bon App\u00e9titFallCoffeeFirst PersonRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
