Pro tip: If you sign up for the Healthyish newsletter, you\u2019ll get the scoop before everyone else.I first read Julia Turshen\u2019s incredibly honest essay about breaking free from diet culture months ago in a galley of her newest cookbook, Simply Julia. I copied and pasted and emailed the essay to myself, highlighting the lines I related to most: \u201cFor so long, whenever I felt fat, or what I deemed fat, it was almost always a way to describe anything other than happy. Not only had I equated \u2018fat\u2019 with \u2018anything other than happy,\u2019 I had set up a tidy, miserable binary for all of my feelings to fit into.\u201dRelated: The Myth of Healthy Eating with Christina Chaey and Vanessa RissettoContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.I\u2019m just beginning to chart a way out of my own version of that binary: the internalized belief that my value as a person should be defined by what I do or don\u2019t eat. For decades, this belief has fueled me as I\u2019ve oscillated between periods I\u2019ve characterized as \u201cextremely healthy\u201d or \u201cextremely unhealthy\u201d; there has seldom been middle ground.I spent a lot of this winter living in one of my \u201cextremely unhealthy\u201d periods. Between the persistent isolation and the weather, I was at a low point, self-soothing with homemade cocktails and a lot of lasagna. I\u2019d wake up every morning and make myself a half-hearted promise that today I\u2019d go for a walk, but then the day would pass me by with no walk and I\u2019d go to bed feeling like I had failed to \u201cbe healthy.\u201dThis week, by contrast, I\u2019ve been in one of my \u201cextremely healthy\u201d periods: I\u2019m loading up on vegetables, whole grains, and beans while barely consuming sugar, alcohol, dairy, meat, or refined carbs. I\u2019m reading in bed with tea rather than snacking in front of the TV. I\u2019m going for an hour-long power walk in the mornings and doing my physical therapy stretches before the very respectable bedtime of 10:45 p.m. I\u2019ve dedicated myself singularly to a routine that has left me feeling, quite simply, elated.But as I rack up more and more days of sugar- and booze-free bliss, my feelings of elation are being steadily replaced by the dread of knowing that, sometime soon, this period will end. I don\u2019t know whether it will happen tomorrow, next week, or next month, but at some point in the future, I will make one decision (ordering too much Shake Shack, drinking one too many martinis) that will signal my brain to kick off a chain reaction of adjacent, familiar habits. The lentil lunches, tea, and power walks will be replaced by late-night chips and too much takeout until I get fed up with all that and revert to my \u201chealthy\u201d self again.I re-read Julia\u2019s essay again while writing this newsletter, and, this time, I highlighted a different section: \u201cI am learning what it feels like to not merely accept my body, but to understand that there\u2019s nothing wrong with it. To love it. To know that no matter how much space it takes up in the world, it\u2019s worthy and I\u2019m grateful to live in it.\u201d These words are different\u2014I don\u2019t yet relate to them in the way I wish I could; they feel like a foreign language I can almost but not quite translate. I don\u2019t yet know how to eat without feeling either \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad.\u201d What I do know is that I need to reconsider what \u201chealthy\u201d means to me.Here\u2019s What I\u2019m Cooking These Days:Photo by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Susie TheodorouSoy and Ginger Steamed FishCrispy Mushrooms With Creamy White Beans and KaleBig-Flavor BroccoliFridge Clean-Out Nabe With Mushroom DashiMarinated Tofu With Brussels Sprouts and FarroWhite Bean and Spring Vegetable StewExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishessayRead MorecultureAny Other Tired Cooks Need Some Serious Lunch Inspiration?By Christina ChaeyRecipes you want to make.
