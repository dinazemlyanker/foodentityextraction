Especially common in Middle Eastern cooking and cuisines (think of your favorites like tabbouleh or kisir), it\u2019s versatile, tasty, and\u2014the real selling point for stressed and time-crunched cooks\u2014ridiculously fast to whip up. Just think, it takes 10 minutes to make bulgur compared to an hour-plus for brown rice. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the original convenience foods,\u201d says Abra Berens, author of the grains-and-beans-focused cookbook Grist.Grist: A Practical Guide to Cooking Grains, Beans, Seeds, and Legumes$35 $30 at AmazonWhat is bulgur?Bulgur is made from cracked whole grain wheat berries that are partially cooked and then dried. This process is the key to bulgur\u2019s convenience\u2014because the cracked wheat berries are fully cooked (much like instant rice!), all you have to do is rehydrate them.\u00a0How do you prepare bulgur?To prepare bulgur, simply soak it in an equal amount of boiling water for 10 minutes, then fluff it up with a fork. If you\u2019re really in a rush, you can boil it like pasta, and if you want to be especially hands-off, soak it overnight. From there, it\u2019s a mildly nutty, chewy, textural blank canvas for any and all seasonings, dressings, and accompaniments.How do you serve bulgur?Dress bulgur as you would any other grain. In Berens\u2019s Crispy Salmon with Bulgur, it gets tossed in fresh dill and topped with a speedy mustard-shallot dressing to accompany fish and thinly sliced fennel. It\u2019s a meal as fitting for a weeknight dinner table as it would be for a dinner party.\u00a0Mix bulgur with your favorite vinaigrette or sauce or just a super simple mix of lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Add it to homemade veggie burgers or employ it as a binder in meatballs and kebabs like kibbeh. You could also eat it entirely plain, swapping it in as a speedier option for rice, quinoa, or farro to accompany everything from lunch-friendly salads to slow-simmered curries to quick stir-fries.Look for bulgur at Middle Eastern or South Asian grocery stores, bulk stores, health stores, or online, often sold in fine, medium, and coarse varieties. They\u2019re all delicious and easy to prepare\u2014just know that the coarser varieties may need to soak longer in hot water. Once you\u2019re stocked up, you\u2019re ready to make bulgur your go-to grain for just about everything.Get the recipe:Crispy Salmon With BulgurA simple meal of crispy-skinned salmon and fast-cooking bulgur gets a special boost thanks to a creamy mustard dressing.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
