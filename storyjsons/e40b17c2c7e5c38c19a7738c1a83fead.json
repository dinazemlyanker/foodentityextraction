I also really care about bringing 100% to my job every day getting exercise, staying in touch with my friends and family, and getting a good night's sleep. That\u2019s where Daily Harvest comes in.By Amanda ShapiroMay 20, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailSweet Potato + Wild Rice HashFacebookTwitterEmailRecently I asked a co-worker at Bon App\u00e9tit to describe my work style, and she said \u201cruthlessly efficient.\u201d I\u2019m not sure if it was a compliment or not, but I couldn\u2019t really argue. Ruthless efficiency is how I get through days that rev up with a 7 a.m. alarm and go at warp speed until I crash into bed at 10:30 p.m. It\u2019s also how I take care of myself.See, being efficient means I can leave the office by 5:30 most days, exercise either before or after work, and eat quick, healthyish food most of the time. But I\u2019m no superhero, and that\u2019s why I love Daily Harvest. When I get squeezed on either end\u2014a hectic morning fixing a bug on the site or a night when I\u2019m going from the gym to the shower to a date\u2014I know I can still get a good-quality, delicious, and healthy meal in. Here are some of the ways that Daily Harvest saves my overcommitted butt on the regular.Tart Cherry + Raspberry Smoothie\nBreakfastI love smoothies because they\u2019re a great way to get vegetables into my belly at breakfast. Daily Harvest\u2019s don\u2019t use any added sugars, preservatives, or stabilizers, so they blend and taste like they\u2019re homemade. Tart Cherry + Raspberry, which sneaks in frozen cauliflower, is my current favorite, though I\u2019m partial to the Banana + Greens and Cold Brew + Cacao too.Sweet Potato + Wild Rice Hash\nLunchI\u2019m a dedicated lunch packer: no long lines for $16 salads allowed. I\u2019m very stubborn about this rule, which means that Daily Harvest\u2019s bowls are often what I grab-and-go. The Sweet Potato + Wild Rice Hash is made with all whole, unprocessed vegetables and grains and heats like a dream in the microwave. It powers me through until dinner...and keeps me from prowling around in the Test Kitchen at 3 p.m.Late NightI don\u2019t usually eat dessert when I\u2019m at home\u2014and I definitely don\u2019t bake desserts on the regular\u2014but I do sometimes crave a bite of something sweet at random intervals throughout the day. Daily Harvest\u2019s Bites are like having a container of (healthy!) cookie dough around at all times. I love all the flavors, but the Cacao Nib + Vanilla ones, made with real vanilla beans and dates, will always reign supreme. They\u2019re soft and chewy so I can eat them right out of the freezer, no baking required. And that\u2019s what I call ruthless efficiency.Get $25 off your first Daily Harvest Box with code HEALTHYISH.Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
