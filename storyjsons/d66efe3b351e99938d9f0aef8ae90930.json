Secondly, let's start with the biggest takeaway: Excess moisture is the enemy. If you\u2019ve ever had disappointing \u2018shrooms (read: slimy, mushy, or gray), it might be because you introduced too much liquid too early on. Because mushrooms are porous, they tend to soak up liquid like a sponge. And once they get to this state, it\u2019s hard to make them crispy or flavorful\u2014they\u2019re just too water-logged.But if they need to be kept away from water, then what's the best way to clean mushrooms? The emphasis is on \"clean\"\u2014which isn't the same as \"wash.\" We recommend starting with a quick inspection before you get anywhere near the faucet. If you\u2019re buying boxed mushrooms from the grocery store, you\u2019re most likely going to get a squeaky clean box. After all, most mushrooms are grown in indoor farms, not harvested from the wild. Unless you see any glaring bits of dirt, you\u2019re ready to get cooking.If you do find any with patches of dirt and grime, grab a dry cloth, paper towel, or, if you\u2019re going above and beyond, a pastry brush, to wipe off any gross bits. Once they\u2019re nice and clean, store them in a brown paper bag in the fridge. We recommend paper because plastic leads to condensation, which leads to slime. If a plastic bag is your only option, be sure to leave it  partially open to ensure circulation.In the worst of cases\u2014you know, the A&E-primetime-special-worthy horrors\u2014give them a fast swish-swish in lukewarm water, then drain in a colander and immediately blot with a towel. Now cook them right away\u2014washed mushrooms don\u2019t keep well. But that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing: It\u2019s a good reason to make mushroom carbonara tonight.Get the recipe:Mushroom CarbonaraMushrooms take the place of the traditional cured pork in this super-satisfying vegetarian carbonara recipe.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titMushroomRecipes you want to make.
