Starting with dry chickpeas you cook yourself will earn you a gold star, but using canned will massively cut down on cooking time.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

We made ours with cilantro and frozen corn. It was crispy, savory, and easy to make. It works as a quick dinner but would be yummy for brunch. I am looking forward to eating it again. Sari10/23/2021I gave the recipe 4 stars as it is, but with the changes I made and will make I\u2019d give it 5 stars.\n(1) I replaced the poblano with a large deseeded jalape\u00f1o.\n(2) I cut the oil down by ~1 T. for each step.\n(3) I used my potato masher to smash more than 75% of the chickpeas.\n(4) Instead of fried eggs, I made a side salad of arugula with lemon, EVOO, and honey to which I added the chickpea/corn dish.\n(5) Next time I\u2019ll fry up some bacon and use the bacon grease to crisp the chickpeas, then add the crumbled bacon on top at the end.Hollis RamseyFlorida10/15/2021This recipe immediately caught my eye while browsing the current edition of BA, and I stickied it as one to try soon. Ultimately, it  was pretty, hearty, and easy enough for a weeknight (I even made my own chickpeas from dried) but it wasn't craveable enough to make it into regular rotation.  AnonymousSeattle10/12/2021Just ok...it was great for a quick, easily vegan-friendly week night meal, but it didn't wow. I used a whole poblano and it maybe would've been better to add a jalape\u00f1o or serrano chile to amp up the heat a bit. SSAArlington, VA10/8/2021This was so good! I\u2019m glad I went with my gut and made it, despite the 3.7 stars (I normally aim to make recipes with 4-5 stars). Savory and sweet, great use of my canned garbanzos. I think the onions here in Southern California must be bigger than in bon appetit land, because I only used half a medium sized (I guess) onion and it seemed like plenty. Anyway, it took some time to make, but was well worth it. Seems like a lot of oil and probably isn\u2019t a low fat meal, but it was all used and didn\u2019t turn out oily. I followed the recipe as written. Thank you!Nikki CAnaheim, CA10/6/2021Really good! I used frozen corn - 10 oz to sub the 3 ears. I baked it in the toaster oven at 400 degrees for 10 minutes with 1/2 tablespoon of oil, then followed the recipe pretty much to a T, only cutting the oil by half. Would make again.Anonymous10/6/2021This is really simple, but even with just salt as the seasoning it\u2019s very flavorful and quick to put together. My chickpeas were a bit dry, so I could have used an extra drizzle of oil at the end, but I\u2019ll definitely be making this again.AnnBoston, MA9/29/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titMainDinnerLunchVegetarianDairy-FreeNut-FreeHealthyishEasyQuickWeeknight MealsChickpeaBeanVegetableCornEggFryRecipes you want to make.
