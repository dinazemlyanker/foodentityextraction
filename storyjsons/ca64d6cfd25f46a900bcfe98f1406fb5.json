The Taiwanese variety is quite hard to find in the States, but the more readily available Thai basil, which you can find at Asian supermarkets, is a good substitute. You can make these noodles with sweet basil if you can\u2019t find Thai, but it will lack the same punch of grassy, spicy flavor.Quick-frying the basil-garlic pur\u00e9e with rice wine brings out the fragrance of the herb and mellows the sharpest notes of raw garlic without completely muting them. The result is a savory, aromatic, licorice-scented green sauce that clings perfectly to wide noodles.This topping combination is inspired by the traditional noodle stands you see everywhere in Taiwan. With crunchy fried garlic or shallots, mung bean sprouts, garlic chives, and an egg on top, this is a complete meal in a bowl that\u2019s easy to execute on weeknights.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

For not much effort, you end up with a meal that tastes like it was made at a restaurant. We made it as is except for frying the egg sunny side up instead of boiling. I would emphasize that having thai basil is key to this dish and it wouldn't be nearly as great with sweet basil. We found thai basil at 99 ranch, labeled as just regular basil. Highly recommend this recipe!AnonymousSan Diego, CA8/31/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titBasilHerbs & SpicesEggNoodlePasta & NoodlesAsianRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
