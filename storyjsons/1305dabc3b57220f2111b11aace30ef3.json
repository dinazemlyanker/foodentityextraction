Let us clarify.By Alex DelanyAugust 6, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailClarified butter is the golden glory we always have stashed in the fridge. It\u2019s purer than butter-butter and has a bold richness and a clean finish, with none of the muted milkiness of some traditional butters. Plus, it has a high smoke point, making it the better choice for high temp cooking.What is it?Butter is an emulsion of fat, water, and milk solids. The clarifying process splits up the trio so we can stop third-wheeling and get straight to the magnificent fat. By slowly heating butter, you separate it into three layers: foam (which is the water evaporating), the sunshine-yellow clarified butter (which is the fat), and the white milk solids. The goal is to remove the water and strain out the solids (usually using a cheesecloth), thereby creating a richer and purer fat that's more shelf-stable, too. Clarified butter is intensely luscious, with a nutty, toasty aroma that breaks free from the heavy murkiness of the original product.So what\u2019s the difference between clarified butter and ghee?Ghee is a form of clarified butter that has been used in cooking and medicine in India for millennia. Rather than just separate out the water and milk solids, ghee-making goes further: The butter is cooked longer, until all of the water is gone and the milk solids brown and sink to the bottom of the pan. This gives ghee an even richer, nuttier flavor than clarified butter.Clarified butter is fantastic in scrambled eggs.\nPhoto by Alex LauWhat it\u2019s good for?Because clarified butter is free from the milk solids that burn and smoke during cooking, it has a higher smoke point than regular butter (upwards of 450\u00b0 F), making it a high temp hero. That means you can get a pure butter flavor in hot applications\u2014like when you're pan-frying, roasting, or searing\u2014because you don\u2019t have to worry about the butter burning. And because it tastes nuttier and more concentrated, clarified butter makes for a final drizzle that's super flavorful rather than simply rich.This liquid gold also makes the simplest recipes look super professional and taste a little, well, extra: Try using clarified butter to make scrambled eggs, popcorn, or crispy fried potatoes even more irresistible. Use it to fry up leftover rice, toast spices, or make incredibly crispy hash browns.And, finally, because there isn\u2019t any pesky lactose floating around, clarified butter lasts longer than butter\u2014up to two months in the fridge (ghee doesn't need to be refrigerated at all). But once you start experimenting with all of its delicious applications, we doubt you'll be able to keep it around that long anyway.Now, put that clarified butter to work in a pan sauce:Easy Steak with Pan SauceA juicy, buttery, steakhouse-worthy dinner in 30 minutes flat.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyButterRecipes you want to make.
