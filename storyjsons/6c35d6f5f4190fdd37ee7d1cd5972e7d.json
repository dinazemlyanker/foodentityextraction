At the age of 7, she moved to Seattle alone and stayed with a family friend. It would be 15 long years before she would see her family again. During her last year of high school, she went on a casting call with a friend. It was Hassan who was asked to be a model, a path that ultimately was not her core destiny. \u201cWhen I was modeling, I was not in charge of the narrative,\u201d she explains. While modeling may seem like a dream to some, Hassan wanted to harness her narrative. \u201cVery early on, I knew it was not a sustainable career and I wanted to be in control of my story.\u201dIn 2014, she started Basbaas, a line of hot sauces and chutneys. \u201cThe last time I modeled was in April of 2015 and that\u2019s right when we launched\u2014I haven\u2019t looked back.\u201d Hassan\u2019s line of all-natural, locally sourced, gluten-free, and vegan products are inspired by a central theme: early life in Somalia, and specifically being raised on the Indian Ocean. \u201cWarm spices like cardamom, coriander, ginger, cinnamon, and cloves do it for me.\u201d All flavors that pair well with her go-to: Pineapple Peach KeVita Master Brew Kombucha.Basbaas comes from the Somali term for chili but is built upon a richer history. Inspired by heirloom recipes of the region, the products, smoky tamarind date sauce, and a spicy coconut cilantro chutney, are the only kind of Somali hot sauces and chutneys available in the United States. \u201cI knew it was something that no one else was doing and I could start the conversation from an authentic space. I didn\u2019t want to take over the people\u2019s tables; I wanted to be at the table.\u201d She imagines that her product will one day be like some of the once-unknown sauces that are now as common as ketchup. She references growing up in the 90s when the now-popular chili sauce would only be available at Asian restaurants. \u201cI want a corner of the table and then move into the center and then on to the plate.\u201dHassan calls herself the ShEO of her company. Being a female in the New York City food industry has given the woman-led business an incredible sense of community. She says that the chefs, book writers, and restaurant owners in this space have each other\u2019s interests at heart and empower one another, noting: \u201cI call them my food sisters.\u201d Her advice to those who need the motivation to try something new, in the food industry or otherwise? Ask, \u201cWhat do you know for sure?\u201d Hassan says that when she was modeling, she was depleted and confused. She questioned, \u201cDo I want to be 40 years old and not in charge, not know how much money was coming in, and still at the mercy of someone else?\u201d She says that if you wholeheartedly believe in what you do, you won\u2019t entertain the pursuit of unfulfilling things. \u201cIf someone needs motivating, ask them \u2018what do you know for sure\u2019 and if their answer doesn\u2019t align with their goals or ideals, then they should run.\u201dRight now, it seems that Hassan is running towards her destiny as she sips her Pineapple Peach KeVita Master Brew Kombucha and reflects fondly on a memory from 2014. She spent a month at her mother\u2019s home in Oslo, and every evening that June her mom would invite people from work, neighbors, and family over for dinner. \u201cMy sisters and I would be cooking for three or four hours and then we\u2019d all sit in a circle eating together.\u201d Perhaps it was this moment that motivated her to find success in the world of food.As a true authority on the condiments of Africa, Basbaas has four new products in the works, and Hassan is soon releasing a cookbook. For this ShEO, the possibilities are endless\u2014and it all starts with trying something new, exploring the unknown, and a little bit of spice.The information in this article is the opinion of the author(s) and in no way reflects the policies or positions of KeVita.
