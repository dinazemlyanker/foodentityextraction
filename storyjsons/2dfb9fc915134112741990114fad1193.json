In January I wrote about baking all the goodies from Roxana Jullapat\u2019s Mother Grains, and this fall we\u2019ve got Grains for Every Season from Joshua McFadden and Martha Holmberg, and now there's my latest obsession, Grist from Abra Berens.I\u2019ll let you muse on why the grain books are popping off (also good: popped grains). Maybe it\u2019s something about how, in times of crisis and discord, (some) Americans seek hippie ideals\u2014peace, buckwheat, and psilocybin\u2014in the hopes that it\u2019ll help us calm down and get along again. Heady stuff. But what I really want to redirect your attention to is how delicious and full of possibility Grist is. Read on for the recipes!The premise is: Abra Berens is the chef at Granor Farm in Three Oaks, Michigan, where she runs a dinner series, works on the farm, and advocates for the region\u2019s local food community. Her first book, Ruffage (2019), was all about veg. We loved it. Grist stars beans, lentils, and grains\u2014three things I\u2019ve been trying to eat more of in between all the cheese, gin, and salami. In 2019, our senior food editor Christina Chaey said Ruffage changed the way she thought about vegetables. In 2021, I can easily say that Grist changed the way I think about grains.Grist: A Practical Guide to Cooking Grains, Beans, Seeds, and Legumes$35 $30 at AmazonWhat makes Grist so special is that Berens has taken things a step further than saying, \u201clentils are good for you, easy to cook, and tasty, here are some recipes.\u201d Even though those things are true. Here she also connects each ingredient to the place, people, and history behind it. I was eating lentils because I love their versatility\u2014I had no idea how regenerative they are for soil too.The cookbook also feels distinctly a product of the pandemic, one that marks a place in time and will stand the test of it.During the pandemic, as Berens writes in Grist, we saw how fragile, fraught, and unfair our food supply is\u2014some stuck-at-home cooks got into sourdough while millions went hungry. We saw people buying shopping carts full of the shelf-stable beans and grains that Berens dedicates her book to. When grocery stores ran out of goods because of interrupted distribution, the demand for local foods increased. At the same time, thousands of largely immigrant farm and factory workers were put on the frontlines of the virus.Berens grapples with all of these tensions in Grist with unadorned, beautiful writing that\u2019s honest and open, and sometimes very funny. There\u2019s a through line of gratitude, too, for these natural resources, their long, complex histories, and the people who tend to them. She gives her words the respect she gives lentils, which is, well, a lot.If you read every page, you\u2019ll learn about how both bleak and inspiring it is to be a farmer right now, every part of the buckwheat plant, how cowpeas came to America woven into the hair of enslaved people, and how wild rice is harvested by Native farmers in Minnesota (and that it\u2019s not even technically rice!). Each group of recipes features an interview with someone in the local food and farming community. When she asks Carl Wagner, a seed cleaner, what he wishes more people knew about his work, he answers, \u201cSimply knowing that this is part of buying a bag of flour or a bottle of whiskey. In some ways, knowing that we exist is enough.\u201dAnd if you make the recipes, you\u2019ll learn easy ways to cook grains, how to meal prep with black beans, and how to turn any grain into a crispy fritter. You\u2019ll never be bored, and you\u2019ll happen to get lots of fiber, protein, and minerals in your body along the way. Trust me, in time the farts will subside.To the recipes!The sauce/condiment section of Grist is a gold mine. I made the bacon vinaigrette this week and have used it as a dressing for a farro salad, marinated beans in it, and stared at it lovingly every time I opened the fridge. I have big plans for the brown butter vinaigrette on roasted sweet potatoes and the walnut aillade on air-fried Brussels sprouts. The mushroom cream sauce is calling to me.The first recipe I made was trout with mustard-dressed bulgur (here we have it with salmon). Bulgur is just parboiled wheat berries, so all you have to do is rehydrate it\u2014either by boiling it for 10 minutes like you would pasta, or soaking it with boiling water from your kettle\u2014cover, and fluff 10-15 minutes later. Easiest grain ever. But also, that mustard dressing is so easy and creamy. I made it another week to dress a farro and cucumber salad for a tailgate and it was almost as popular as the French onion dip. Almost!Crispy Salmon With BulgurA simple meal of crispy-skinned salmon and fast-cooking bulgur gets a special boost thanks to a creamy mustard dressing.View RecipeChickpeas: smashed and crisped, they\u2019re ready to be the base for anything you\u2019re making for dinner tonight.Garlicky Smashed Chickpeas With CornThese aren\u2019t your average crispy chickpeas\u2013here, garlicky garbanzos get lightly smashed before frying, creating layers of texture.View RecipeSince reading Grist, I\u2019ve been making big batches of what I think of as \u201cthe thing of the week\u201d and then frying it up, tossing it in salads, or marinating it in dressing depending on my mood. When bulgur is the grain of the week, I love frying it in a pan with some oil until it almost pops and then adding the crispy bits to salads. You MUST try this. When lentils are \u201cthe thing of the week,\u201d I make this easy recipe in which you fry them up and serve with brats, cauliflower, and a lemon-herb sauce:Fried Lentils and BratwurstLooking for something new to do with the lentils sitting in your pantry? Fry \u2019em until crisp, then pair with juicy sausages and a citrusy mojo sauce.View RecipeAnd finally, rice. This thicker-than-congee rice porridge is so easy\u2014throw in some cheese, greens, call it a day\u2014you can\u2019t not make it this winter.Cheesy Rice Porridge With GreensThis 5-ingredient rice porridge is pure cold-weather comfort in a bowl. (Did we mention it\u2019s cheesy? It\u2019s cheesy.)View RecipeThese are just four great dishes from a book so packed with recipes (and SO MANY variations on those recipes) that you will definitely find something for dinner tonight, tomorrow, and next Wednesday. The ingredient lists are minimal and the cost of the groceries is low too, relying mostly on cheap dry goods, vegetables, and the occasional protein. You have permission to use canned beans and to skip the Beano and to substitute dairy to your heart\u2019s content.
