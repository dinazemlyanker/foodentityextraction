These are the 17 new cookbooks we can\u2019t wait to stain.River Caf\u00e9 30 by Ruth RogersWhen Rogers Gray Italian Country Cook Book was published in 1995, it launched a food moment, the ripples of which are being felt to this day. The seductively elemental Italian recipes from Ruth Rogers and Rose Gray\u2014untrained chefs who had started London\u2019s River Cafe as a commissary for the architects in Richard Rogers\u2019s practice on Thames Wharf\u2014sent me and countless others scrambling for ingredients like lacinato kale and salt-packed anchovies. Many a dinner party was built around their pumpkin risotto, and many was foiled by a failed Chocolate Nemesis cake. While the dishes at the fabled restaurant\u2014home to such young cooks as April Bloomfield, Jamie Oliver, and Clare Deboer and Jess Shadbolt of NYC\u2019s King\u2014were flawless, the published recipes were rather loosey-goosey. The stunningly designed 30th-anniversary edition of the beloved blue book corrects that, as the recipes have been tested and updated. Like the restaurant, the dishes in River Cafe 30 feel as vital and vibrant as ever.Cake by Maira Kalman and Barbara Scott-GoodmanSweets have always figured in Maira Kalman\u2019s jaunty paintings. Now she has created Cake, a cookbook that delights the palate and stirs the heart, with narrative, nostalgic illustrations followed by recipes, created by her friend Barbara Scott-Goodman, for favorites like coconut layer cake, plum torte, and the honey cake that her cousin Tali always puts into her suitcase before she returns home to NYC. Especially poignant is the image of the pink \u201cphilosophical cake\u201d that her family made while living in Rome in the \u201880s, iced with the words, \u201cA day without dancing is a wasted day.\u201d It\u2019s Love, Loss, and What I Baked.A Baker\u2019s Year: Twelve Months of Baking and Living the Simple Life at the Smoke Signals Bakery by Tara Jensen\u201cElbow deep in dough, I surrendered.\u201d North Carolina baker Tara Jensen achieved Instagram fame first for her artful, post-latticed pie crusts and masterful bread, then for her raw breakup posts and Deep Observations from the remote countryside. Her fearlessly honest\u2014some might say way oversharing\u2014book, A Baker\u2019s Year, is part diary, part artisanal baking manual, with recipes for New Moon Cake, Broken Down Berry Pie, and Bloody Butcher Pancakes. In short, millennial gold. The instructions lean toward the minimalist and intuitive, meaning you might need to watch a YouTube video to master that crust or know if your starter\u2014excuse me, (A) Culture (of Resistance)\u2014is really kicking. While you\u2019re online, check out Julia Kramer\u2019s excellent profile of Jensen for BA.Variations on the Full Moon Cake from A Baker\u2019s Year.\nA BAKER'S YEAR. Text and illustration credits (c) 2018 by Tara Jensen and reprinted by permission of St. Martin's Press.Fresh India by Meera SodhaBritish blogger Meera Sodha\u2019s debut cookbook, Made in India, was an instant classic, creating authentic Indian flavors by using what most people have in the fridge. (In fact, I have some of her cilantro-coconut chutney in the freezer right now, waiting to be added to chicken.) Her vegetarian sequel, Fresh India, is just as dog-earrable, with recipes like Sri Lankan dal with coconut and lime kale and the addictive shredded Brussels sprout thoran, or stir fry, which prompts you to shred them in the food processor. (Light bulb/forehead-slapping moment.) Like Sodha, with her bangs and red lipstick, these recipes feel both relaxed and spontaneous, taking much of the intimidation out of Indian cooking.(Right) Photo by Jennifer MayJapan: The Cookbook by Nancy Singleton HachisuJapan: The Cookbook is an essential, authoritative, approachable guide to the country\u2019s cooking by expat Nancy Singleton Hachisu, author of the cult favorite Japanese Farm Food. The condensed history of Japanese food alone is both humbling and endearing. (We Americans can surely learn something from a cuisine that began around 12,000 B.C., when the creation of earthenware pots and the use of ash to remove toxins or bitterness from mountain vegetables first began\u2014both still used today.) The recipes are brief and simple, with big payoff once you\u2019ve stocked your pantry. Get ready to make fried chicken meatballs with nori; flowering greens with sake-soy; and crispy greens with sesame part of your repertoire.Feast: Food of the Islamic World by Anissa HelouAnissa Helou\u2019s Feast: Food of the Islamic World provides an insightful, lushly depicted journey into millennia-old cuisines many of us know relatively bupkus about. Helou\u2019s chapter on bread alone is a travelogue, seducing with recipes for flat and filled breads from Yemen, Somalia, India, Morroco, Iran, Turkey, and more. (The Zanzibari savory doughnuts and Arabian date bread are particularly appealing). This being a celebratory book, recipes for whole beasts\u2014or just their humps, legs, and breasts\u2014elaborate rice dishes, and spice mixes combine with more makeable pleasures like meatballs in sour cherry sauce, baked rice cakes with lamb, and Ramadan date cookies. Helou is both scholar and hedonist, which makes for the best kind of guide in the kitchen.Superiority Burger: The Vegetarian Hamburger Is Now Delicious by Brooks HeadleyBA contributor Brooks Headley not only runs Superiority Burger, the best vegan-leaning burger joint in NYC, his punk ethos and deadpan humor make for some of the best cookbook reading ever. Now he brings his \u201cmodest, non-fancy\u201d ethos, as well as recipes for hippy wraps, tofu-fried tofu, burnt broccoli salad and, dear lord, that gelato, home with Superiority Burger: The Vegetarian Hamburger Is Now Delicious. Even if you don\u2019t make his signature burger, you\u2019ll enjoy reading the recipe, in which he proclaims, \u201cThe un-likeness to the real thing is uncanny\u2026 They are absolutely recognizable as food, and are meant to be a Luddite response to the modern gaggle of vegetable patties that bleed and squirt and ape.\u201d Vegans\u2014no, humans\u2014rejoice.The oh-so-famous veggie burger at Superiority, coming to a kitchen near you.\nSam HodgsonSomething Old, Something New: Classic Recipes Reinvented by Tamar AdlerFood writing\u2014that is, good writing about food\u2014ain\u2019t what it used to be. Posts and feeds can\u2019t compare to the confident, informed words of M.F.K. Fisher, Elizabeth David, or Patience Gray. They were actively cooking and researching (and living), then weighing each phrase, producing lasting works that no emoji can summarize. Editor and Chez Panisse cook turned author Tamar Adler has set herself in their footsteps, producing books with cooking in them rather than straight-up cookbooks. Her debut, An Everlasting Meal, made leftovers seem quite lovely, a dinner of toast and beans a quiet moral victory. With Something Old, Something New: Classic Recipes Reinvented, she strives to revitalize fusty classics and long-forgotten dishes, bringing them into this century with verve and ease. And so this spring might find you serving\u2014without air quotes\u2014Waldorf salad and Charlotte Russe; A Respectful Omelet and braised lettuce on toast. To get to the recipes, you will clamber past tightly crafted sentences like \u201cThis [shrimp] bisque is for fishermen and boat builders, for falconers, toll collectors, bricklayers, cooks, floor cleaners, window washers, bakers, bookbinders, gas pump attendants, metalworkers, and teachers, a most noble if not royal collection of humanity indeed.\u201d It\u2019s bookery meets cookery.Other books of note:Aska by Fredrik BerseliusThis season\u2019s prettiest entry in the \u201ccollectible, not cookable\u201d category is from the excellent Brooklyn restaurant Aska.Jam Session: A Fruit-Preserving Handbook by Joyce GoldsteinThe former Chez Panisse chef has just the right touch.Repertoire: All the Recipes You Need by Jessica BattilanaThe title says it all: The perfect one-stop cookbook that builds kitchen confidence to boot.Food52 Any Night Grilling by Paula DisbroweFinally, a grilling book that\u2019s not bro-y.
