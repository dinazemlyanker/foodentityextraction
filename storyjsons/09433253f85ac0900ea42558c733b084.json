Perhaps you heard him call it \u201cprobably my favorite knife that I own.\u201d Perhaps you\u2019ve even read a little story about this \u201cone weird knife\u201d in New York mag? Perhaps you\u2019ve even attempted to find this elusive tool, which, up until now, has been challenging, to say the least. Well, here\u2019s a very small piece of good news: Brad Leone\u2019s cleaver/slicer of choice has officially been brought back into production by Lamson Products, a Massachusetts company since 1837. It\u2019s now stocked in our shop, along with a whole slew of It\u2019s Alive\u2013themed merch.The man and his knife.\nPhoto by Laura MurrayWhat, you ask, is so special about this knife? Let\u2019s ask the man himself: \u201cI love the knife so much because of its lightweight and thin, large blade,\u201d says Brad. \u201cIt\u2019s a bench scraper and a knife.\u201d The folks at Lamson added a few details: The full-tang blade (meaning, it runs the full length of the handle), in a Santoku shape, is made from tempered American high-carbon stainless steel that is flat-ground for precision and then hand-sharpened and finished for a razor-sharp edge. The ergonomically designed, contoured handle is made from durable walnut. The knife can be purchased as a set with a custom-made leather sheath, made from Wickett & Craig English bridle leather with double hand stitching, extra-strong brass rivets, and a brass snap that keeps the sheath firmly in place for storage. Whew! Lot of information. Shop for it here.Three more new items made for It\u2019s Alive fans and pretty much no one elseThe Black Garlic Fan ShirtLoud. Distorted. Vigorous. Fermented. Inky. Sticky.
