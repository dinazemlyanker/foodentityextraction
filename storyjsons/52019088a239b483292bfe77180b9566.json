Carrie Bradshaw could never.By Anya TchoupakovJanuary 30, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailIn Person of Interest, we talk to the people catching our eye right now about what they\u2019re doing, eating, reading, and loving. Next up is Claire Fitzsimmons, founder and director of Salty, a newsletter and online publication exploring modern dating, sex, and relationships for women, trans, and non-binary people.In the world of wellness, there\u2019s a bit of an illusion when it comes to sex. Everyone and their mother is glowing, doing tantric yoga, and looking \u201caccidentally\u201d cute with their S.O. in matching, sustainably made leisurewear\u2014but is anyone talking about, uh, the sex itself?Claire Fitzsimmons is.Photo courtesy of SaltyFitzsimmons is the founder of Salty, a weekly-ish newsletter and online publication full of the sex and dating advice we all wanted but were afraid to ask for, like texting templates that help you set boundaries and essays about how kink can help heal emotional trauma. Fitzsimmons herself is a powerhouse non-binary femme and a staple of the NYC fashion and nightlife scene. \u201cI\u2019m not a Cosmopolitan girl, I\u2019m not Alluring, I\u2019m not Glamorous, and I\u2019m not in Vogue, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d she tells me in an e-mail. Instead, Ms. Fitz (as she is commonly known) is all about amplifying non-cis-heteronormative voices that are not often heard. \u201cCollaboration means listening to others first,\u201d Fitzsimmons says.Sustaining a digital platform that highlights NSFW content that isn\u2019t porn has been incredibly challenging, and Fitzsimmons has encountered obstacles (i.e., the patriarchy) every step of the way. Salty kept getting booted from mass e-mail platforms, and Instagram/Facebook refused to allow promotional posts (and kept deleting photos with even the hint of a nipple). Then hackers deleted their whole site after Salty broke an important #MeToo story. Still, the bright, brash voice of Salty cuts through the millennial pink clouds of other sex and dating sites. \u201cSalt is visceral and human,\u201d says Fitzsimmons. \u201cSweat is salty, tears are salty, sex tastes salty.\u201dHere\u2019s what Ms. Fitz has to say about sex and saltiness in all its forms.What keeps me going despite the haters\u2026 is all the amazing supporters who are super vocal. There are hackers, MRAs, trolls, and tone police, too. It comes with the territory. If you\u2019re on the internet all day, it\u2019s easy to think the world is full of assholes, but the thing to remember when it all seems too much is that you don\u2019t hear the people who don\u2019t say anything. Most people are reasonable and kind. There are way more silent supporters than there are people who want to bring you down. And I know that because I see the numbers, and I read the lovely messages from our community.I\u2019ve learned\u2026 to stop trying to please everyone. In the beginning of Salty I would get so upset if someone said something mean or rude about our mission, but over time I\u2019ve come to realize that no matter what you do, someone is going to have a problem with it, so you might as well just do you.I blow off steam by\u2026 riding my bike through Brooklyn. Oh and masturbating, duh!Sexual wellness is\u2026 essential for your mental wellness.My favorite sex toy is\u2026 my faithful rabbit! (I\u2019m old school).I\u2019m always snacking on\u2026 CBD gummies. They are my JAM! Also iced tea. After I quit booze and coffee a year ago (#soberlife) I\u2019ve become hopelessly addicted to iced tea. I like really shitty American iced tea from Dunkin Donuts (sorry, Healthyish). But it\u2019s better than the alternatives. I snack on popcorn, too.My love language is\u2026 touch and telling. I need to be told I\u2019m amazing and loved, and I need to be cuddled constantly.I\u2019m currently obsessed with\u2026 knowing everything about the changing landscape of digital media. How are people monetizing? What are their strategies? What\u2019s working? What\u2019s not? How do you keep up with this rapidly disrupting market? I read Harvard Business Review and business books religiously.The biggest challenge of starting a radical, intersectional media brand is\u2026 money. We\u2019ve seen massive, impressive growth in readership since we launched eight months ago, but the real problem has been finding people willing to invest in it. It\u2019s not that there isn\u2019t value\u2014womxn\u2019s sexual wellness is a massive market with billions of dollars of revenue potential\u2014but there are institutional and patriarchal roadblocks that make it hard to monetize. I\u2019ve shared some screen grabs on my socials from the sexist venture capitalists we\u2019ve encountered and people are blown away by the overt and underhanded misogyny we\u2019ve faced. The good news is that there is a secret network of women in angel capital who are getting stuff done on the DL. We\u2019ve tapped into that. We\u2019re also exploring fresh revenue models like memberships, products, and events.The best advice I ever got was\u2026 from my mentor Beth Comstock. She says, \u201cGreat ideas can come from anywhere. There is great value in the opinions of those who don\u2019t think like you.\u201d I\u2019ve really taken that to heart.To me, activism means\u2026 intersectionality. Consider the complex sociological injustices that have created the world we live in and use your unique privileges to amplify the voices of those who need it more than you. To me, activism is civil disobedience. I love to march, rally, show up, make noise, stick it to the man. Activism means actually DOING something\u2014building a platform for the voices of women, trans and non-binary people, for example, not just raging and re-gramming memes on the internet. That\u2019s an unpopular opinion, but really, what are we doing that isn\u2019t just noise?I\u2019m always re-reading\u2026 my Instagram feed? Ugh! It\u2019s a nightmare!I make the most difference by\u2026 Passing the mic.I\u2019m salty\u2026 ALL the time. To be salty means to be annoyed. I\u2019m a non-binary femme and I\u2019m tired of being pandered to and talked down to. I know how strong I am. I know I\u2019m a force\u2014just like many other women, trans, and non-binary people know we are. Our strength and rage is not something to hide, it\u2019s something to be fiercely proud of.Censorship is\u2026 a workhorse of the patriarchy. It\u2019s an ongoing battle for Salty.Wellness means\u2026 fighting for yourself. Your wellness is a manifestation of your love for yourself, and it will not be prioritized by anyone except you.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishInterviewsPerson of InterestSelf CareRead MoreLifestyleLike You Don't Want to Know Abena Boamah-Acheampong's Skincare RoutineBy  Siraad DirsheRecipes you want to make.
