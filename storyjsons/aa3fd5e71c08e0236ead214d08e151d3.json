KalbiBy Irene YooAugust 26, 20214.7(20)Read ReviewsTriangleEmailPinterestPrintPhoto by Isa Zapata, food styling by Kat BoystovaEmailPinterestPrintEmailPinterestPrintL.A. kalbi is a uniquely Korean-American dish that uses flanken-style short ribs rather than the butterflied English-style ribs traditionally used in kalbi in Korea. It\u2019s widely accepted that L.A. kalbi originated in the Korean immigrant community in Los Angeles, where home cooks turned to the cheaper flanken-style\u00a0ribs that were readily available at local Mexican markets. These short ribs, which are thinly cut across multiple ribs so each strip of meat has three little bones along one edge, are perfect for marinating and quickly grilling and result in tender meat that\u2019s sweet, salty, and well-caramelized all over.The marinade usually has some combination of soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, garlic, ginger, and a sweetener, but every restaurant (and Korean mom) has a different variation. Here grated Asian pear and granulated sugar add sweetness, but you\u2019ll find recipes that call for grated apple or kiwi, honey, brown sugar, and even lemon-lime soda, a sneaky pantry substitute for fruit. Feel free to make substitutions in your own marinade\u2014use apple cider vinegar in place of rice vinegar, an Anjou pear if you can\u2019t find Asian pear, and so on\u2014depending on your taste preferences. Grilling the ribs over charcoal results in the best flavor, as it adds smokiness to the caramelized meat. But you\u2019ll also get good results if you cook them on a gas grill, in a grill pan on the stovetop, or broil them in the oven.While L.A. kalbi can shine just fine on its own with a simple bowl of rice and some kimchi, this recipe goes all-out with everything you need to enjoy the kalbi in ssam (lettuce wraps): fresh leaf lettuce and perilla leaves for wrapping; pa muchim, a fresh, lightly dressed scallion salad that cuts through the ribs\u2019 meaty sweetness; and hot, cooked short-grain rice. Use a pair of kitchen scissors\u2014a staple in Korean cooking\u2014at the table to cut the three-boned ribs into single-serving pieces, or cut the meat off the bones for easy ssam wrapping. Wash it all down with an ice-cold beer and you\u2019ll be licking your fingers, and the bones, clean. \u2014Irene YooAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Soak in a mesh strainer set inside a large bowl of ice water 10 minutes to remove some sharp bite and allow time to curl slightly. Swish scallions around with your hands to remove any sliminess, then drain well and pat dry. Wipe out bowl; return scallions to bowl.Step 4Whisk vinegar, mirin, gochugaru, and sugar in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved; season with salt. Add dressing to scallions and toss to coat.Step 5Prepare a grill for medium-high heat; oil grate. Remove short ribs from marinade and grill until well browned and slightly charred around edges, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a platter and top with sesame seeds and sliced scallions. Let rest 5 minutes, then cut meat into bite-size pieces with kitchen shears.Step 6Arrange lettuce and perilla leaves (if using) on a second platter. Scoop rice into individual bowls.Step 7To eat, stack a palm-size lettuce leaf and a perilla leaf in your hand. Top with rice, meat, and scallion salad and wrap into a tight bundle.

Kalbi?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (3)Back to TopTriangleEdit on last review: also pro tip; take the leftover sauce that you have and bring it to a rolling boil in a saucepan for 5 min. Skim off the top and the sauce is now safe to eat. For dipping it was so amazing! IBECOOKINGSOMETIMESLong Beach, CA9/28/2021This recipe was pretty good. What really got me to do it was the picture and boy did it not disappoint in the appetizing fished look. I however would suggest adding a cup of fresh cut green onions. It would really take the marinade up a notch. just add it in straight to the finished marinade. Also using 1/3 cup of sugar and another 1/3 cup of brown sugar. Came out amazing the second time. IBeCookinSometimesLong Beach, CA9/28/2021Meh, I found the rib sauce/marinade a little bland. It lacked punch.
