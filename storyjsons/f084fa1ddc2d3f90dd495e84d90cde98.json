Clean and lightly oil grate. Rub tenderloin with \u00bc cup oil and sprinkle with peppercorns and kosher salt. Grill over hottest part of grill, turning often, until lightly charred on all sides, about 5 minutes. Move to cooler part and continue to grill, turning often, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 120\u00b0 for medium-rare, 25\u201330 minutes longer. Transfer to a platter and let cool.Step 2Just before serving, thinly slice tenderloin on a large cutting board you can also serve from (or transfer back to platter). Arrange tomato slices, cucumber slices, and basil alongside. Drizzle tomatoes and cucumbers very lightly with vinegar. Drizzle oil over everything and season liberally with sea salt and ground pepper. Serve with Lemony Yogurt Sauce and/or Grilled Serrano Salsa Verde alongside.Step 3Do Ahead: Beef tenderloin can be grilled 1 day ahead. As soon as it is cool, wrap tightly in plastic (do not slice) and chill until ready to serve.How would you rate Cold Beef Tenderloin with Tomatoes and Cucumbers?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkExplore Bon App\u00e9titBeef TenderloinBeefMeatTomatoVegetableCucumberBasilHerbs & SpicesSummerEasyWeeknight MealsMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreeGrillingFourth Of JulyMemorial DayLabor DayDinnerRecipes you want to make.
