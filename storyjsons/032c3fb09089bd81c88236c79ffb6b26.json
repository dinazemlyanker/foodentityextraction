We love a big bowl of massaged kale, but feel free to use whatever salad greens you have on hand.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Loved it! AnonymousPhiladelphia 2/18/2022Added a jammy soft boiled egg and used vegan feta instead of halloumi. Super delicious JillChicago 2/3/2022Cooked chicken thighs+shallots separate from squash+halloumi mixture per previous reviews. This helped pull out the halloumi and squash sooner than the chicken, the halloumi crisped up way sooner than the chicken being done. Excellent recipe, will definitely repeat! Svetlana Scottsdale, AZ2/2/2022This salad is pretty simple to make and delivers BIG on flavor! The combination of squash, Halloumi, shallots, lemon, garlic, cumin, and chicken thighs work so well together, humble ingredients that punch above their weight when roasted all together. A great balance of savory and sweet, and soooo comforting. The kale and dressing serve as a great foundation, the flavors work seamlessly and the greens help add variety to the texture. I cooked it for 35 minutes, which I worried was too long, but the chicken, Halloumi, and squash were all perfectly happy to get extra crispy. I recommend adjusting the ratio and adding a little more squash and halloumi than the recipe calls for. Why skimp out on some of the best players in this symphony? ClamSeattle, WA1/29/2022Seems like there is a split opinion on cooking times/temps.  Mine turned out perfectly using the time and temp as written.  Squash was cooked perfectly, cheese was a bit crunchy on the outside, chewy in the middle.  Raising the chicken up on the little \"shallot towers\" helps get the hot air under them so they don't sit in their own juice and get soggy.  Plus, the roasted shallot thrown into the salad is yummy!  Be sure to not use giant chicken thighs, as I could see that impacting the cook times.  I even threw in most of the schmaltz from the pan for some extra flavor.  Everyone in the family loved it - even my husband who doesn't usually like raw kale.LBinTXTexas1/25/2022It would be great if BA ever included nutritional value to the recipes Anonymous1/24/2022This was good. I did need to throw the cheese into the toaster oven on its own at the end to get some some extra crunch. Oh, and keep an eye on that sheet pan in the oven at 425, don\u2019t trust the times!ShaunDunedin, Fl1/23/2022Awesome!  The squash was creamy, the cheese crunchy, and the chicken moist. I had no problems cooking everything on one pan\u2014everything came out perfectly. Kim S1/23/2022Great flavors! Truly delicious! But I agree with many posters--putting the cheese and squash on a separate sheet pan allows you to take them out before the chicken. I also used boneless skinless thighs because cutting the hot chicken off the bones is too much work. Dressing was great, and the whole dish really worked well together!AbbyLos Angeles, CA1/20/2022Great flavors but it worked better when I roasted the chicken separately from the halloumi and squash. These ingredients do not cook at the same temperature.  andromedanew york, new york1/18/2022The length of time in the oven and the high temperature practically dissolved the shallots and made the cheese inedible.  I suggest sauteing the shallots and cheese on the stovetop.  Having the shallots under the chicken as a seasoner was unremarkable.  Anonymous274031/18/2022I want to try so many of these yummy recipes including this one but need nutritional info. Is there a way to find that? Thanks in advance!\n\n\nAnonymousSouth Acworth, NH1/16/2022Really great weeknight recipe!
