We were so enamored of these beautiful doshirak that we asked Kim to teach us how to recreate a home-cooked version that includes these savory rolled-egg omelet slices filled with toasted seaweed snacks and a secret ingredient: Parm shavings. They\u2019re equally good enjoyed on their own as a little snack, as a side dish to a larger meal, or sliced and served with a bowl of rice. Kim uses sheets of toasted seaweed snacks from brands like Seasnax or gimMe, which come pre-seasoned with sesame oil and salt. Get the recipe for the celery and turnip pickles, also featured in the box.Ingredients2 - 4 servings5large eggs2Tbsp. mirin\u00bdtsp. white or regular soy sauce\u00bdtsp. kosher salt1Tbsp. vegetable oil2oz.

Heat oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-low. Pour in one third of egg mixture, rotating skillet to evenly distribute. Cook until egg is mostly cooked, about 1 minute. Scatter one third of Parmesan over and shingle 2 seaweed snacks vertically down the center. Using a rubber spatula and starting from one side, fold egg up and over itself to roll up tightly; push to one side.
