And while I am not an undercover mochi agent at the moment, if the opportunity were to arise, I can\u2019t say I\u2019d turn it down. (Koda Farms, sponsor me!)The truth is, I have an organic, unsponsored love for mochi\u2014the family of Japanese confections made primarily of ground or mashed glutinous rice\u2014and its springy, stretchy, chewy, gummy, soft, squishy relatives around the globe, from black sesame-filled Chinese tangyuan to Indonesian kue moci or Filipino bibingka.While I seek out mochi and its varietals whenever I\u2019m traveling, the one I\u2019m most likely to make at home is Hawaiian butter mochi. It\u2019s a super simple one-bowl cake made with eggs, coconut milk, evaporated milk, butter, and, of course, the glutinous rice flour that gives it its characteristic bounce (that\u2019s where the mochiko comes in). The ingredient list is short and the results are great: Why wouldn\u2019t I suggest that we develop a recipe when given the chance?I want to bounce right off that speckled slice!\nPhoto by Laura Murray, Food styling by Yekaterina BoystovaThis cake is the result of that (probably annoying) persistence. It\u2019s like Hawaiian butter mochi dressed up for an evening out. In place of subtle coconutty richness, you\u2019ve got big, bold black sesame. The earthy, nutty seeds are both in the sparkly caramel sauce that shellacks the surface and in the cake beneath. Gray, buoyant, and chewy (I\u2019ll go ahead and call it \u201csupple,\u201d if my editor allows me to leave that description here) [Editor\u2019s note: I will!], the cake is good at room temperature, it\u2019s good straight from the fridge, and it\u2019s good for surprising your friends who might expect a flourless chocolate cake at your New Year\u2019s party but are instead getting something so much more fun and lively and resilient.One note of caution, from experience: Mochi cake tends to sort of expand in your stomach so even though it is tempting to eat a huge piece, proceed with caution. Reader, would someone working for Big Mochi be so honest? You be the judge.Get the recipe:Black Sesame Mochi Cake With Black Sesame CaramelAttention, lovers of squishy and chewy foods!
