It\u2019s everything the Momofuku empire does well but tailored to the Vegas crowd.ORDER THE: the usual buns and large-format meals, like bo ss\u00e4m and five-spice rotisserie duck that feel at home in Vegas. Go to town on the show-stopping bigeye tuna and strawberry dish, which gets covered in a mound of shaved foie gras, and the seafood grand lisboa, the mouthwatering result of paella, seafood pasta, and David Chang all hanging out.THE VIBE IS: familiar. Between the food and the room with its usual sleek wood-heavy design, you might just forget that you\u2019re in neon-lit Vegas\u2014until you see the \"Eiffel Tower\" out the window.PRO TIP: Going with a big group? Ask for the secret karaoke room.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open everyday for lunch, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., and dinner, from 5:30 to 11 p.m. Hit Peach Bar, located at the restaurant entrance, for late-night refueling: Sunday to Thursday, 11 p.m. to midnight, and Friday to Saturday, 11 p.m. to 1 a.m.WE ALSO LOVEBeijing Noodle No. 9Authentic hand-pulled noodles in the middle of the Strip\u2019s busiest casinoGolden SteerEverything a steakhouse should beIn-N-Out Go animal style.
