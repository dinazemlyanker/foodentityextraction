She told real stories of her place. She exploded the reality of Southern living for her time.\u201dBy Hilary CadiganOctober 19, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailMashama BaileyPhoto by Chia ChongFacebookTwitterEmailRumor has it, the cornbread got her walking.Zora Neale Hurston\u2019s mother had gone out to the yard to do some laundry and left her daughter inside with a crumbly golden square to munch on. Suddenly, a wild hog broke into the house and went straight for the cornbread. Not about to be hog bait, the toddler hoisted herself up against the arm of a chair and started shuffling as fast as her tiny legs could carry her, leaving a trail of crumbs in her wake.\u201cShe got up and tried to run away from the pig!\u201d Mashama Bailey says with a laugh. \u201cApparently that\u2019s how she learned to walk. It\u2019s one of those things about her childhood: cornbread and buttermilk.\u201dBailey, the James Beard-nominated executive chef and partner at The Grey in Savannah, Georgia, found the anecdote in Valerie Boyd\u2019s seminal biography of Hurston, Wrapped in Rainbows. It was just one of many books she read to prepare for cooking a lunch honoring the late literary icon, who has been called the most significant black woman writer of the early 20th century. She was also one of the most controversial, due to the particular way she chose to celebrate black culture: writing in dialect and refusing to champion desegregation.\u201cI\u2019m not really from the South,\u201d Bailey tells me. \u201cMy mom was raised in Georgia but I was born in New York. Zora grew up in coastal Florida and then moved to Harlem [where she became a pivotal figure in the Harlem Renaissance]. I felt like even though we went opposite ways as far as destination, our stories concerning food were quite similar.\u201dThat\u2019s why, when John T. Edge called her up asking if she\u2019d like to prepare lunch for 350 people based around a literary figure for the annual Southern Foodways Alliance fall symposium in Oxford, Mississippi, Bailey chose Hurston. \u201cZora left the South to support herself, but she never ran away from it,\u201d Bailey says. \u201cShe told real stories of her place, and she had a real connection to working-class folks. She exploded the reality of Southern living for her time.\u201dThe tablescape, with pages from Hurston's books.\nPhoto by Hilary CadiganInside a high-ceilinged former power plant nestled beside Oxford\u2019s historic main square, long communal tables are set for a feast. Shamrock green table clothes are spread beneath a runner made of pages pulled from Hurston books and glued together, their edges scalloped like lace. Clusters of lemons, pears, and oranges strewn with baby\u2019s breath frame platters piled with pulled rabbit, bread and butter pickles, and pillowy hot buns fresh from the oven.Bailey\u2019s first course is titled \u201cJook Snacks\u201d as a nod to the ramshackle establishments where southern black folks, barred from most restaurants under Jim Crow, would gather to eat, drink, and dance. \u201cZora wrote beautifully about juke joints and the people who gathered there,\u201d the menu reads. We make miniature sandwiches out of the buns, slathering them with homemade preserves and piling them high with tender strands of rabbit meat. Pickle chips add a sour snap.\u201cThe menu is very homey,\u201d Bailey says. \u201cOne thing about Zora is that she had a very sensitive stomach. I think because she was so controversial in her time, that's where all of those things went. If you\u2019re always anxious or always putting yourself out there, it has to go somewhere.\u201dThe meal strikes an interesting balance between Bailey\u2019s interpretations of Hurston, a mysterious figure dead 58 years, and the chef\u2019s own life. The Savannah-style red rice with shrimp and stewed okra that comes next feels particularly potent. \u201cI took some of the things that I liked about her, and took some of the things that I liked about being in Savannah, and made something new out of it,\u201d Bailey says. \u201cI'm trying to channel myself, if I was her. What would I want on my table? What would I have in my refrigerator? What would I cook for my guests?\u201dSmoked whiting and grit cakes.\nPhoto by Hilary CadiganThe answer: smoked whiting layered over creamy grits cakes; Tabasco-braised collards with smoked pig tails (perhaps a nod to that cornbread-hungry hog); and sweet potatoes, ash-roasted and bathed in a deep, smoky mole. Guests reach across the tables to heap food onto mismatched china plates with floral patterns straight out of grandma\u2019s dining hutch.\u201cI think when you have conversations with people that you are comfortable with, food always comes up,\u201d Bailey says. \u201cAnd I thought that was interesting, and so embedded into Zora\u2019s writing. You can tell where a person's from by what they eat.\u201d The chef reminds me that Hurston herself once opened a small restaurant, and always grew her own vegetables. Then she harkens back to her own upbringing in the Bronx, where her Georgia-born mother would serve roast chicken and rice, gravy and greens every Sunday for supper. Those meals wove themselves into her roots, and even back then Bailey would refer to herself as a Southerner, once-removed. Food, family, literature, politics, the struggle to find one\u2019s place in the world: They\u2019re all connected.For her finale, Bailey nods to Hurston\u2019s most famous work, controversial in its time but found now on most high school reading lists: Their Eyes Were Watching God. Cornmeal buttermilk tea cakes, in honor of protagonist Janie\u2019s one true love (the flawed yet thoroughly human Vergible \u201cTea Cake\u201d Woods), set beside sticky peanut brittle and candied pears. \u201cThese were some of Zora\u2019s favorite things,\u201d Bailey tells me. \u201cThey signify courtship, love, a sweet treat for your sweet.\u201dWhen the meal is over I meet Bailey under the tent in the parking lot that\u2019s served as a sprawling outdoor kitchen. She\u2019s breathless with relief as satisfied diners shake her hand. I ask her to explain in as few words as possible why she chose to center perhaps the biggest lunch she\u2019s ever served around Zora Neale Hurston. She doesn\u2019t skip a beat.\u201cBecause of black girl magic.\u201dRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
