But Schmidt's always comes through.By Catherine CivginOctober 16, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailI sweat a lot. Not, like, an excessive amount but I will never be the person who goes into a heated yoga class and walks out looking the same as I did before (I\u2019ve tried). Because of this, I have always been hesitant to give up my conventional, chemical-laden antiperspirant for something safer for my health. But after a friend sent me a horrifying article on the potential effects of antiperspirant deodorants, I decided that I had to make the switch, so I started my search for a natural alternative.I tested a lot of natural deodorants before finding the one. I tried a bestseller from Goop, sampled multiple recommendations from friends, and even tried the brand that Emma Watson swears by. While all of these products touted non-toxic ingredients and had great reviews, all of them also had issues. Some were unable to protect against odor, many didn\u2019t absorb wetness and almost all had a texture so rough that it actually hurt to use. After testing and disliking six different brands, I was ready to give up. Then my aunt introduced me to Schmidt\u2019s.Jaime Schmidt founded Schmidt\u2019s out of her kitchen in Portland, OR in 2010. In search of a natural deodorant that she could use while pregnant, Schmidt decided to formulate her own. Despite having little experience making consumer goods, she began testing different formulas until she found the ideal one. The result? An aluminum-free, cruelty-free deodorant that was rid of parabens, phthalates and artificial fragrance. Oh, and this product actually worked.\u201cOnce I realized that my deodorant countered a common customer perception\u2014that natural deodorants don\u2019t work\u2014I decided to go all in and strategize turning Schmidt\u2019s into a legitimate business,\u201d says Schmidt. Since its humble beginnings, Schmidt\u2019s has grown massively. The company, which now sells soaps and toothpastes in addition to deodorant, has a loyal following. You can now find Schmidt\u2019s in thousands of retailers, including Target, where I bought my first stick. Three months later, I haven\u2019t looked back.The Coconut Pineapple scent is my jam.\nPhoto by Alex LauSchmidt\u2019s is my stick of choice because, to start, it actually stays on throughout the day. With Schmidt's, I can apply in the morning, go to work, and not have to worry about my deodorant lasting through EOD. (Not having to reapply deodorant in the bathroom during a busy workday is a game-changer.) I also like Schmidt's because it\u2019s easy to apply. Whereas other natural deodorant sticks were rough and caused underarm rashes, Schmidt's glides on smoothly.In addition to their Signature Stick Formula, Schmidt\u2019s also sell a Sensitive Skin Formula that does not contain baking soda, and I've found that it applies even more smoothly than their original stick (I\u2019m partial to the coconut pineapple scent). Schmidt's also sells glass deodorant jars for those who prefer not to use stick deodorants.For me, Schmidt\u2019s is a clear winner. Non-toxic formula? Check. Effectiveness? Check. Inspiring founder? Check. While the process of finding Schmidt\u2019s was by no means easy, I am glad that I saw it through and ultimately let go of my beloved antiperspirant for a healthier option. Now I can confidently swipe my deodorant on every morning without a guilty conscience or underarm rashes. And that is pretty big.Buy it: Schmidt\u2019s Natural Deodorant, $8.99All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
