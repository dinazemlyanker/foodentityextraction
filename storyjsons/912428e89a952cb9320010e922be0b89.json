Good morning! Happy to be here. And it was a good morning because I began my day with strong black coffee and a bowl of The Pinole Project\u2019s peanut butter and cacao pinole chia oatmeal, which I zapped for two minutes and topped with toasted sliced almonds. Eaten across Latin America, pinole is finely ground cornmeal that\u2019s usually mixed with spices and/or chia seeds to make a filling breakfast porridge. The Pinole Project\u2019s recipe is corn + rolled oats + chia + cane sugar + salt + cinnamon with a trace of lime.The Pinole Project Pinole Oatmeal$10 at Amazon (1 bag, Original)$28 at Amazon (3-bag Variety Pack)The corn here is heirloom white Olotillo corn from Oaxaca, which makes the porridge smell like a just-pressed corn tortilla\u2014deep and corny, made even more fragrant by that pinch of cinnamon. (Olotillo is a type of white corn that\u2019s thousands of years old, which, for corn, is young.) You can microwave your pinole oatmeal, heat it on the stovetop, or make it as overnight oats, letting the chia seeds expand a bit. It\u2019s barely, barely sweet and I was so relieved it contained sugar and not my nemesis, sweeter-than-thou Stevia. The PB & Cacao flavor has cocoa powder and peanut flour, and it\u2019s just as subtle.Maya Jacquez, who founded The Pinole Project in Woodbury, N.Y., alongside her family, says the company is an homage to her abuela, Adela Jacquez, and her pinole recipe. Pinole, as Adela reminded her grandchildren, was fuel for Aztec warriors and the Tarahumara, an indigenous people in Mexico known for being long-distance runners\u2014which means it\u2019ll help you power through your morning even if you won\u2019t be running 50 miles.The bag touts that the oatmeal is vegan and gluten-free and packed with Omega-3s, fiber, and protein, plus all kinds of other nutritional bonanzas. But the flavor of the nutty, savory corn is the selling point for me. It reminds me that some of the most delicious ingredients are the ones that have been here the longest. It\u2019s just the packaging that\u2019s changed.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
