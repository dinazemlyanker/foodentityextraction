Here\u2019s My Best AdviceHint: Thanksgiving dinner is never really about the turkey at all.By Chris Anderson, as told to Pamela VachonNovember 22, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration By: Liana FinckFacebookTwitterEmailHi. This is Chris with the Jennie-O Turkey Hotline. So you\u2019re calling with a question about the turkey for your Thanksgiving dinner\u2014oof, are those your kids screaming in the background? Or your in-laws? I get the sense we\u2019re not just talking about the turkey. It\u2019s about the whole event, with the cooking, the cleaning, the family dynamics\u2026.So I\u2019m not going to make this too transactional, like, \u201cThis is the cooking time; this is the thawing time.\u201d I\u2019m going to take a minute to connect with you. You\u2019re not alone here. People are going through this.Illustration by: Liana FinckTake a deep breath. If it\u2019s your thing, have some wine. Often, what\u2019s a difficult experience now turns out to be a fun family story later, and I love it when people call back to share how it worked out. It might take a few years for it to become a funny anecdote and not a source of stress and shame, but hopefully it\u2019s something down the road you will laugh about. And there are work-arounds for just about everything. Even if you realized you forgot to pull the turkey out of the freezer until Thanksgiving morning there\u2019s very little that can\u2019t be managed with a sense of humor and an improvisatory spirit.Illustration By: Liana FinckHere are the most common questions I get as a turkey therapist: How much turkey do you need for your family? One to one and a half pounds per person, but feel free to go bigger if you\u2019ve got ambitious plans for leftovers! How can you tell if the turkey is fully cooked? Three things: meat thermometer, meat thermometer, meat thermometer. You want the temperature to reach 165 to 180 degrees in the thickest part of the thigh. How much time does that take? Depends on the size of your turkey, but it ranges from about three and a half to five and a half hours. And the big question: How do you thaw it in time? The best way is to plan ahead and thaw it in the refrigerator between two and five days depending on the size of the turkey. But you can utilize a day-of cold-water method if necessary and still be sitting down for dinner before midnight. And no, your grandmother\u2019s time-honored trick of rolling turkey in dirt is not a food-safe way to thaw it. Neither is utilizing your car\u2019s heated seats. Yes, those are both questions I have fielded on the line.Illustration By: Liana FinckAt the root of all these questions is a deeper one, and that's How do I do this right? And I\u2019m here to tell you: Cut yourself some slack. It\u2019s difficult to perfect a giant meal that you only get to practice making once a year. There\u2019s a performative aspect to Thanksgiving dinner that makes people especially vulnerable. Even as a turkey crisis counselor, I become extremely stressed out when I have multiple things that all need to be done at the same time. And if something doesn\u2019t turn out perfectly, it\u2019s doubly frustrating. But don\u2019t judge the whole dinner experience based on these scorched-earth sweet potatoes! Were they harmed? Yes. Do they represent my skill? No.Sometimes unforeseen events will cause you stress. I remember speaking to one lady whose mom had recently passed away, so the Thanksgiving torch had been passed to her. She was putting a lot of pressure on herself trying to make sure everything went perfectly in order to carry on her mom\u2019s traditions.Illustration by: Liana FinckBut you can create unconventional traditions from difficult circumstances too. One family always has canned stew for dinner on the night before Thanksgiving to pay homage to the year they got caught in a blizzard on the big day and had to eat microwaved stew in a motel room. Another woman always includes a meat-and-cheese tray on her Thanksgiving table\u2014not a fancy charcuterie board, just grocery-store cold cuts and Colby Jack\u2014because one year she had to abandon Thanksgiving altogether to meet her husband who got a last-minute pass before his military deployment and that\u2019s what they ate. Now that meat-and-cheese tray is always on the Thanksgiving table, and that\u2019s the tradition they\u2019ve passed down to their kids, like, \u201cHey, this meat-and-cheese tray is part of this now.\u201d Those unique elements are what make your Thanksgiving special. Not whether the turkey skin is perfectly browned and Instagrammable.Illustration by: Liana FinckAs for me, after weeks of working the Turkey Hotline every year, my favorite way to spend Thanksgiving is when I get to travel to someone else\u2019s house, take a side, and not worry about the turkey at all. I\u2019m not going to ask how you thawed it; I\u2019m not going to look at the meat thermometer you used; I\u2019m just going to enjoy the meal. But I\u2019m here if you have any questions.Chris Anderson is a consumer response specialist for Hormel Foods\u2014and a stand-up comedian\u2014who has worked the Jennie-O Turkey Hotline the past seven years.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCultureLifestyleThanksgivingRecipes you want to make.
