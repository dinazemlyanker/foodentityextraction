Cut into 9 cubes.Step 2Whisk soy sauce, maple syrup, rice vinegar, red pepper flakes, and ginger in a small bowl.Step 3Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. When oil is rippling across the surface, carefully add tofu so it doesn\u2019t splash. Cook, undisturbed, until very crisp and dark brown underneath, 3\u20134 minutes. Carefully turn and repeat on opposite side. Holding tofu back with a spatula or slotted spoon, pour out oil into a small bowl. Return skillet to medium-high heat and add soy sauce mixture.

Served it on a bed of brown rice and kimchi.  I drained the tofu and left it in the fridge wrapped in a dry cloth so that it crisped up in no time when cooked.   You can easily double the sauce/glaze as I could have used more!carlyepiHartford, CT3/18/2022Delicious - like others, it took longer for my tofu to get \"golden\" but the sauce was delicious. I drained my tofu on paper towels and saut\u00e9ed sliced carrots, celery and onions. I put the saut\u00e9ed veggies aside and added the sauce to the pan, let it reduce slightly then added the golden tofu. I let that cook down a bit, then added the veggies again. Served with Jasmin rice and sprinkled with sesame seeds. Soooooo good!PamelaBoston, MA1/12/2022Really great, I make this at least once a week. Getting tofu crisp first is key!Anonymous6/14/2021I lost all crispiness of the tofu as it sat in the liquid to reduce.  Next time, I'll cook the liquid down a bit first to reduce it and *then* will add the tofu at the very end to coat it.  I think adding a bit of flour or cornstarch would help it stick to the tofu more, too.  The flavor was good - will do this again.  :)BoorayinCamas, WA4/29/2021so yummy! I added garlic because no recipe is complete without garlic. great easy meal with pantry staples I always have around. tofu tip \u2013 freeze in package overnight, thaw in fridge during the day, and then you'll be able to get a lot more water out of it before you cook. doesn't even required pressing, you can just gently squeeze the water out with your hands over the sink.MacArizona4/22/2021Like candied tofu! Instead of chili flakes I used Chili Crisp. Fantastic! Joyce N Canada3/14/2021So easy and so delicious! I topped a Buddha bowl with this and used extra glaze as dressing. It is my new fav!Diana DiLunaSalida, CO3/12/2021Terrific Make Tofu Great Again recipe. Made a Tofuian out of me, a Trumpian. Trump's the guy who who represents at least 73 million actual legal voting Americans.AnonymousVBeach, VA2/10/2021Wow to Tad C . . . keep your politics out of recipe reviews . . .AnonymousWA1/25/2021HA!  I still can't believe that people make assumptions that others are being paid to write reviews just because THEY didn't like a recipe!  How Trumpian.  Your reviews are FAKE reviews.  AS IF?  \n\nI gotta say that I have been planning on making this for a while and I'm happy that I finally did.  It was easy and delicious and, despite the fact that I didn't have Pepper flakes, I added a dash of Cayenne Pepper and it wasn't too spicy.  Tad CDowntown Los Angeles, CA11/15/2020Making this one for the 2nd time tonight! Highly recommend, very tasty and easy!Stephanie WagnerOntario11/7/2020Best tofu recipe AnonymousCT8/30/2020Wouldn't have posted anything until I saw someone say the reviewers were paid. I was absolutely not paid, and also have come back to this recipe many times because the tofu is delicious. Read the reviews if you think you might want to make a modification for sweetness or spiciness!AnonymousWashington, DC8/21/2020It\u2019s okay. Pretty spicy. I think they must pay people to write these reviews.Anonymous8/10/2020So amazing, makes tofu a star over meat!
