One of my pet peeves as an African American culinarian is the speed with which someone on social media will invoke the names of past luminaries in the face of new figures and their work in a \u201cbut see here\u201d way. It\u2019s as if the quality and originality of the new work are already in question: \u201cThat\u2019s nice, but what do they really have to say?\u201d It\u2019s a nauseating but common take, never explicit, always subcutaneous, and it hurts us all. It limits the prospects for the future and inhibits conversation by putting new ideas in the shadows of the known.And yet, I didn\u2019t come to this space to focus on those who would keep us in a bubble, but to talk about the self-styled \u201cCheFarmer\u201d (chef and farmer) who bursts it. When I first met Matthew Raiford in 2013, he welcomed me to Gilliard Farms in coastal Georgia to introduce me to his soul and life\u2019s work. The ancient trees with their Spanish moss seemed to mirror the beauty of his locks. Every inch of the land made me ache for the peace and creativity he was working to achieve on ancestral land, from the crushed oyster shells that made war on nematodes to spared huckleberry bushes destined for doobie cobbler to his experiments with Carolina Gold rice, splendid Georgia variety collards, Georgia Rattlesnake watermelons (from which he made an excellent molasses used in barbecue sauce), and the like.To be sure, there are other books by Black authors of Gullah Geechee heritage, and each one of them has something to teach us about the dynamism and variety that African heritage Lowcountry folk have to offer. Each voice is colloquial and discretionary, engaging in some of the same subjects and variables, but the access and vantage points are key. Black foodways are not a monolith, and Matthew\u2019s voice and vision come marching to a new beat in his new book Bress \u2019n\u2019 Nyam, written with Amy Paige Condon.Photo by Siobh\u00e1n Egan, cover courtesy of The Countryman Press, a Division of W.W. Norton & CompanyThere aren\u2019t that many farm-to-table cookbooks written by Black people, especially Black people that currently own significant and inherited\u2014and those two words are important\u2014pieces of land that they actively cultivate. \u201cWe took all those pictures for the cookbook at the farm,\u201d Raiford tells me. \u201cThe farm is our laboratory. I wanted the person cooking from it to see the world from underneath the oaks trees, to see the fields. I wanted them to see what oysters on hot tin really look like and how to roast a hog.\u201d The pictures tell a story of resistance by existence\u2014of a family and community determined to remain and create and be resilient.The title mimics scripture: \u201cEat and be satisfied,\u201d says the Psalmist, and \u201cbless and eat!\u201d\u2014the translation of the Gullah phrase Bress \u2019n\u2019 Nyam\u2014says Raiford. (\u201cThe publisher literally took the first name I proposed,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThey didn\u2019t ask me to change it. I knew I was in the right place.\u201d) The book, published by Countryman Press, is grounded in Raiford\u2019s family history, stories about the food creators in his lineage, and the land that his great-great-great-grandfather Jupiter Gilliard (born in 1812) began farming with his wife, Riner, as freed people. Six generations later, Matthew built the place back up with his former partner Jovan and a small army of family and friends. \u201cA sense of place is important,\u201d he says. \u201cI had not seen one person like me write a cookbook and put it out on a national scale. I wanted to talk about where I am and being on this family land since after the Civil War. My South being coastal Georgia should be drastically different from someone else\u2019s South two hours inland.\u201dI\u2019ve seen in person the brown, gently tattered family letters found in the pictures of the first few pages of Bress \u2019n\u2019 Nyam. They are genealogical gold. In one letter from Georgia to a relative who left during the Great Migration, we get descriptions of the crops coming in: melons, corn, and sugarcane. Raiford treats them like sacred ancient artifacts, his own Rosetta stone. \u201cWe wrote to each other, we documented our lives, we had great penmanship,\u201d he says. \u201cMy great-grandmother would write to my nana about what they were taking to market, what they were planting. I wanted to put our stories and our lived history in there. I wanted people to see our Blackness as our humanity.\u201dAt the heart of Raiford\u2019s work is Brunswick, Georgia, but the story of his bloodline is the story of the South, and beyond. The family\u2019s geography is rooted in the coastal swamps of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, but also Bridgeport, Connecticut; Miami, Florida; and other journeys.\u201cIt is a tradition among the Gullah Geechee that when we need answers, we turn to the wisdom of the ancestors, our source,\u201d Raiford writes in his introduction. \u201cI have organized the recipes in this book according to their elemental beginnings: earth, water, fire, wind, nectar and spirits.\u201dThe recipes in the cookbook act as mnemonic devices for the culinary creativity Raiford grew up with, and his own journey as a chef. His father spent some time as a professional baker, blessing mornings with apple turnovers and French pastries, and the best oatmeal cookies come snack time. And yet, \u201cMy dad didn\u2019t want me to be a cook,\u201d Raiford recalls. \u201cHe\u2019d say, \u2018There are many things I want you to be, but a cook ain\u2019t one of them!\u2019\u201d Black people never got called chefs, only cooks.Chef Matthew Raiford organized his recipes by the elements: earth, water, wind, nectar, spirits and fire.\nPhoto by Siobh\u00e1n EganRaiford\u2019s mother Effie\u2019s legendary home cooking led to innovations like her Brown Sugar Molasses Pound Cake, the recipe for which he includes in Bress \u2019n\u2019 Nyam. \u201cMy mom claims she was messing around,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody at the \u2018chewch\u2019 ate every bit until there weren\u2019t even crumbs! Dude, that was like 40 years ago, and everybody living still remembers. That same recipe is still holding tight.\u201dIn the De Wata/Water section of the book, you\u2019ll find the recipe for great-grandfather Horace\u2019s fish and grits with stewed tomatoes and okra. \u201cAnd it was crunchy okra,\u201d Raiford adds, debunking any misgivings. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know okra could be slimy. Fried okra, roasted okra, stewed okra\u2014I had never had it slimy.\u201dThe chef boldly declares that Southern food\u2019s longevity and popularity is rooted in its dynamism; it is never static, never boring: \u201cDoes anybody understand that Southern cuisine is the only cuisine that has grown and matured?\u201d he asks. \u201cEverybody wants to be part of the story, and to be known for having the best Southern cuisine. There\u2019s no one way to do any of these dishes. It\u2019s the totality of the experience, not just one experience.\u201dOne of my favorite ways to use a cookbook is to mentally construct the pantry of the chef writing it. Bress \u2019n\u2019 Nyam is rooted in Southern constructs\u2014a very particular South and sense of place. It is Gullah Geechee, but it\u2019s not about replicating any specific canon of dishes. Raiford\u2019s travels and experiences from California to Italy (where he once represented the United States at Slow Food International\u2019s Global Gathering) have made an impact on how he interprets the food of home. His vision allows him to see the global in his childhood particulars. He brings his nana\u2019s love of produce and fresh vegetables to his quiche and giardiniera. He marries Ethiopian berbere spice, jerk seasoning, feta, bottarga, mole, gelato, and compote with things he can attain in a short walk to the chicken coop, the orchard, the brackish waters surrounding Gilliard, or his garden, a modern rival to Jefferson\u2019s experimental field at Monticello.As a chef, Raiford offers all the things you might suspect from Lowcountry Georgia, prepared through the lens of Matthew\u2019s constant search for twists: muscadines turned into jelly and compote; peanuts boiled in potlikker or served over chicken and purple ribbon cane syrup; oysters roasted under burlap soaked in salt water or tucked beside fried turkey; a fresh barbecued Ossabaw Island hog; the tang of wild sumac, huckleberries, pomegranates; mustard greens served over his signature CheFarmer grits. The classics are there, too, with excellent angles: sweet potato pie glazed with evaporated milk, fried mullet, fried chicken, shrimp perloo, and red rice. Even better is an homage to the drinking culture of the Deep South juke joint, drawing on moonshine and local gins with fruity, salty, and pungent elements like butterscotch, ginger, and hibiscus.The book is all the more surprising because Raiford did his best to remove himself from that bubble that others consider \u201cSouthern\u201d or \u201csoul food.\u201d For many Black chefs in the 1980s, the stereotypical assumption that they would rely on diner favorites was stultifying. \u201cIn culinary school, I tried to distance myself from Southern food,\u201d Raiford says. \u201cNobody allowed me to do what I wanted to do because they had a narrow vision: fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, collard greens, everything has to be fried or with bacon.\u201d But in addition to the need for variety and cooking beyond expectations is the concern for promoting balance and healthier practices. \u201cI\u2019ve been using a little steak seasoning to make my greens because there were so many people who like their greens without meat. You\u2019re looking for that umami, that smokiness\u2014not necessarily the meat.\u201dIn his work, Chef Raiford expands the notion of health. To him, health means the maintenance of healing practices that trace back centuries: the harvest and the use of plants like mullein, sumac, thistle and wild thyme. \u201cGood health is eating in balance and knowing the vitamins and nutrients and knowing that certain wildcrafted herbs and spices we grow and buy have health benefits,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s also knowing the quality of the food you eat, and the soil. Good stuff in the ground and good stuff out\u2014you have to know what kinds of nutrients are in the soil so you know what\u2019s going in your body.Bress \u2019n\u2019 Nyam tackles so many issues in what could have been just a collection of recipes meant to amuse and celebrate. It is a microcosm of one Black chef\u2019s hard work toward a holistic vision for his resurrected family farm. Old luminaries are honored in new ways. Here we have an opportunity to really see the big picture\u2014that concern for preserving family and local traditions, supporting Black businesses like farms and distilleries, eating well and in health and with joy, and keeping people of color on ancestral land are a braid of power. This is the conversation we need to celebrate and expand, not just long for. This cookbook is here to tell us that time for that conversation is now.Photo by Siobh\u00e1n Egan, cover courtesy of The Countryman Press, a Division of W.W.
