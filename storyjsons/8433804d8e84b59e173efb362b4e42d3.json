The next time you scan the bins of sweet potatoes at your grocery store or farmers market, look for the variety known as Okinawan (or sometimes Hawaiian) sweet potatoes. They have beige skins and intensely bluish-purple flesh that\u2019s dry and starchy and ideal for roasting or frying. If you can\u2019t find Okinawans, look for other tan or purple-skinned varieties such as Japanese sweet potatoes.Ingredients4 Servings2\u00bdlb.

It was way too over powering. Either cut out the vinegar or add way less. AnonymousTampa, FL11/17/2021This was really tasty! Were the sweet potatoes crispy? No, but still very good. I had some halloumi I needed to use so I threw that in as well and it worked great! Will definitely make again.KatieVancouver, Canada10/14/2021Why it  always says \u201ccrispy sweet potatos\u201d?  You cannot make them crispy ever... the type of starch\nAnd fibre they have cannot do this possible At least  once they are  dehydrated previously and cook in the oven drizzled with lot of oilXiomara Canada1/21/2021Wow wow wow!!!! I\u2019m not usually a potato fan, but I am now! These are delicious and super easy to follow for us non experienced cooks. Ngozi Lagos, Nigeria12/31/2020Delicious! Followed recipe exactly, using a mix of Japanese and purple sweet potatoes, and it was so good. The sauce is addictive. However, I will add less lemon peel to the sauce next time because it was a bit overpowering. Also, if you have leftovers, don't reheat the sauce because it falls apart! Let it come to room temp.AnonymousLongmont, CO12/26/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSweet PotatoPotatoVegetableTahiniCondiments, Sauces & PastesEasySideDairy-FreeGluten-FreeVegetarianVeganHealthyishRoastDinnerRecipes you want to make.
