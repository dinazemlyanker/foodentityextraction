Here the popular Brazilian treat is served with molho verde, a punchy herb-forward sauce, for a perfect snack that, according to Apolinario, can be improved only by serving alongside a cold beer.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Add oil and blend until sauce thickens slightly. Transfer to a small bowl.Do Ahead: Molho verde can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill.Rice BallsStep 2Rinse rice in a fine-mesh sieve under cold running water until water runs clear; drain well. Bring rice and 2 cups water to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce heat to low, cover pan, and cook until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 15\u201320 minutes. Remove from heat, uncover, and let cool.Step 3Mix rice, egg, flour, milk, onion, salt, garlic, ginger, and rosemary in a medium bowl until well combined. Scoop out 2 heaping tablespoonfuls of rice mixture and roll into a ball with your hands, then flatten into a 3\"-diameter patty. Using your thumb, make a shallow indentation in the center of patty; place a piece of cheddar inside. Pinch rice mixture together to encase cheese; roll into a smooth ball. Transfer rice ball to a plate; repeat with remaining rice mixture (you should have about 12 rice balls).Step 4Fit a medium Dutch oven or other heavy pot with thermometer.

When you test the sauce in its own, it\u2019s nothing special, but pairs great with the ginger and rosemary. It was our first time making anything like this and the directions were accurate except we decided to do a double batch of the rice balls because the one cup of whole milk yielded way more sauce than needed. So if you do the one batch, one could get away with doing a half cup of milk.
