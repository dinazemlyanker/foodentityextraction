It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Chicken is the answerA friend asked me for a slam dunk chicken recipe and it reminded me how much I love/adore/cherish Andy Baraghani\u2019s hot honey chicken thighs. START FROM A COLD PAN, PEOPLE. The toast fried in the chicken fat is almost absurd. Sometimes I just make the chicken + honey part because endive is not typically in my crisper. Look out for \u201cWhat\u2019s in my crisper?\u201d a new column in Us Weekly.Get the recipe: Hot Honey Chicken Thighs with Fried BreadThe dough senses fearThis week marked the debut of Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s newest not-TV but can-we-just-call-it-a TV show, \u201cMaking Perfect.\u201d The Test Kitchen comes together to create the perfect pizza, Avengers-style, with different cooks in charge of different components. I watched all three hours in two nights. If you haven\u2019t watched yet, let this be a warning: Do NOT watch without pizza, even if it\u2019s frozen Trader Joe\u2019s or floppy Papa John\u2019s. It is absolute torture to watch Molly Baz bite into slice after slice of crispy-crust, gooey fresh mozz, mortadella mountain-topped pizza while sitting on my couch with a cup of water. TORTURE.Watch the first episode here, and view the preview below.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Hi JesseTo celebrate the launch of the show, there was an exclusive party in the Test Kitchen, which explains how my invite got lost in the mail. According to sources\u2014again, I wasn\u2019t there\u2014a fan named Jesse (hi Jesse!) drove nearly 11 hours from Ohio to attend. Another fan was in town from D.C. to see Hamilton AS WELL AS to come to this event, and presumably, find $100 on the sidewalk, fall in love, and find the perfect pair of jeans. Sounds like everybody had a good time.Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensChocolate chip cookiesChris Morocco\u2019s biggest fear was letting everyone down. His family. His friends. Strangers on the internet. He had to develop BA\u2019s best chocolate chip cookie. After tasting approximately 15 different iterations, I can testify that this is The One. Chewy, gooey center, crispy, caramel-like edges, balanced bitter chocolate chunks to fragrant vanilla, nutty brown butter and just enough salt to bring everything out.It took nearly an hour for him to explain every ingredient decision to me (read that here). At one point when he was telling me what would happen if you added flaky salt to the top of the cookie, his eyes widened, his hands waved in the air, and he cried out: \u201cIf there\u2019s salt on top, we can\u2019t put as much inside, then what if the person opts out of the flaky salt, and the rest of the cookie is undersalted? The cookies don\u2019t taste right! Is that the world you want to live in, Alex Beggs?!\u201dGet the recipe: BA's Best Chocolate Chip CookieNew words, same worldIt\u2019s time to throw out the 500-pound dictionary propped on a pulpit in your living room, because Merriam-Webster announced some official new words this week, making all other dictionaries woefully irrelevant. Except for Urban Dictionary, and the red squiggles that know your worst failings. There are officially new Food Words. So let\u2019s welcome to Planet Earth, \u201cghost pepper!\u201d Good job, \u201cchai latte!\u201d You\u2019re finally legal, \u201cumami\u201d! And a round of applause for \u201ccow parsnip,\u201d who\u2019s been waiting a long time for this. A long time.The best use for vodkaMy friend Brennan, who asks everyone he meets whether they\u2019d \u201crather be a ghost or a dog,\u201d told me that he\u2019s made the Basically vodka sauce every day this week. It reminded me what a good recipe it is, so I\u2019m sharing it again here. Make it! (I\u2019m a dog.)Get the recipe: Rigatoni with Vodka SauceNewsI\u2019ve been thinking in equal parts about the newly discovered black hole\u2014and Dr Pepper\u2019s new flavor. Why does Dr Pepper need a new flavor when it already contains 23 in one great product? Why are people arguing about [anything] when there\u2019s \u201ca cosmic abyss so deep and dense that not even light can escape it\u201d??? Both seem to offer clues about the universe. Or more mysteries. Hard to say. We tried the unlabeled new Dr Pepper in the office this week, at 9:30 a.m., and guessed the flavor. I stuck my nose into a plastic Dr Pepper\u2013branded plastic cup and asked Jesse Sparks, who knew the flavor, \u201cblack cherry?\u201d He shook his head. Then Alex Delany and I tasted it. Not cherry at all, but raspberry, or blackberry, or the elusive, fictional blue raspberry. OH WAIT. We realized. \u201cBerry supreme,\u201d said Delany. Some kind of triple berry, we concluded. And we were RIGHT. \u201cDark berry\u201d is the flavor. And it\u2019s not as good as the original.Take your Amiel to work dayI accidentally walked into the Test Kitchen on \u201cTake Your Kid to Work Day\u201d and encountered a pack of ravenous kiddos making variations on avocado toast led by the brave Gaby Melian. Young Celia owns an iPhone but had never had avocado before! \u201cMy mom puts it on toast everyday, so I figured it was good,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom puts butter and cinnamon on hers,\u201d chimed in Marin. Over at Andy Baraghani\u2019s station, Kyle\u2019s toast was garnished with pink pickled radish, which he did not like. \u201cI don\u2019t even like toast,\u201d he, a cool guy, said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in carbs either,\u201d added Andy. A large adult child swooped in to make himself an avocado toast on a rice cake with a blanket of pickled radishes. \u201cThey didn\u2019t go for the sprouts, huh?\u201d asked Amiel Stanek, who proceeded to crash the group photo, pictured above.Unnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekGoing with the \u201cMaking Perfect: Pizza\u201d theme, let\u2019s revisit one of Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s favorite internal feuds. The legitimacy of the canned black olive, which I consider a delicacy. I could eat a whole can, but it would take a while, because I\u2019d need to first apply them to every finger and then tap my hands together like Mr. Burns before eating them one by one. Slowly. I love a sliced black olive on pizza, but man-who-definitely-didn\u2019t-break-an-office-lamp-with-a-golf-club this week Adam Rapoport forbids it. \u201cNever. Ever,\u201d he said. Emily Schultz is with me. Brad Leone is with me: \u201cOh my goddddd,\u201d he groaned and leaned back in his chair, next to a portrait of Jerry Garcia. \u201cSalty, that little squeak, meaty. Some are better than others...but I like them all.\u201d Chris Morocco sent me a Slack message that nearly shot off the screen in flames: \u201cTerrible! Not even a food! Treated with poison to make them bouncy! Brad and Schultz love them of course.\u201d \u201cWOOF\u201d was all I got out of Molly Baz, despite being a known brine-enthusiast. \u201cI LOVE THEM SO MUCH,\u201d said Carla Lalli Music, validating me and really the only opinion that matters here. She felt a gravitational pull towards them in the grocery store during her second pregnancy and always has them in the house. \u201cMy body literally needs them. You can\u2019t fight that. It\u2019s like the tides of the moon.\u201d Andy rolled his eyes, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not from Jersey,\u201d and walked away.Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecookingChris Morocco Just Made the Best Chocolate Chip Cookie EverBy Alex BeggscultureJoy, Pain, and Puke at the 2019 Hot Sauce ExpoBy Alex BeggsPhotography by Amy LombardcultureWhat Kind of Person Makes a Breakfast Sandwich On a Weekday?By Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
