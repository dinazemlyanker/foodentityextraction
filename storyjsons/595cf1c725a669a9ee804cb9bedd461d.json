New Zealand\u2019s M\u0101ori people have used the m\u0101nuka plant for medicinal purposes for centuries, but m\u0101nuka honey didn\u2019t gain global popularity until the late 1980s after New Zealand biochemist Peter Molan\u2019s discovery of methylglyoxal (MGO), an antimicrobial and antibacterial compound found in high concentration in m\u0101nuka honey. (Some honeys have it in trace amounts, but not nearly as high as in m\u0101nuka honey.) Today m\u0101nuka honey can be seen across Instagram slathered on skin to fight acne and recommended by holistic health practitioners for its ability to fight throat infections and help heal wounds.A small jar of high-grade m\u0101nuka honey can run upward of $180, making it one of the world\u2019s most expensive honeys. It\u2019s also reportedly one of the world\u2019s most fraudulently labeled ingredients.According to a 2014 report by the New Zealand Ministry of Primary Industries, New Zealand produces about 1,700 tons of real m\u0101nuka honey each year, but over 10,000 tons of \u201cm\u0101nuka honey\u201d is sold on the global market. The truth is, that pretty jar of m\u0101nuka in your medicine cabinet might be adulterated or diluted with other honey. It might not be m\u0101nuka honey at all.Up close and personal with a m\u0101nuka honey hive.\nThe m\u0101nuka flower blooms for only two to six weeks each year and only grows in New Zealand  (and, according to Australia, Australia). Hives produce a limited amount of high-grade monofloral m\u0101nuka honey each season, driving prices up to $1,000 per kilogram. Those sky-high prices are one of the main reasons the product is frequently mixed with other honey and even synthetic chemicals. According to The Guardian, New Zealand\u2019s historic case again Evergreen Life Ltd. earlier this year included 67 charges of alleged adulteration of m\u0101nuka honey with chemicals, including dihydroxyacetone, a chemical used in tanning lotions.Inaccurate labeling is another rampant issue. Just last year, Trader Joe\u2019s had a class action lawsuit filed against it for selling m\u0101nuka honey fraudulently labeled as 100 percent pure that tested between 57.3 and 62.6 percent m\u0101nuka honey. (There\u2019s a motion to dismiss the lawsuit this month.)Fera Science Ltd., a British research company that investigates and tests food products, found that m\u0101nuka honey sold in America was much lower quality m\u0101nuka than advertised on the jar. Manuka Doctor 20+ was shown to have such low levels of MGO that it didn\u2019t even register on the test, suggesting that it was possibly not m\u0101nuka at all. Wedderspoon\u2019s honey, which is labeled with the brand\u2019s own grading system, \u201cKFactor,\u201d showed low levels of m\u0101nuka\u2019s unique compounds. (While the K Factor system is approved by New Zealand\u2019s Ministry of Primary Industries to quantify m\u0101nuka\u2019s honey by MPI standard, it does not measure for m\u0101nuka\u2019s prized antibacterial methylglyoxal component. Instead, it looks at the pollen count and four other unique chemical markers.)Labeling and terminology are two of the biggest hurdles consumers have to overcome when searching for a jar of authentic m\u0101nuka honey. \u201cLabels with \u2018Active\u2019 and \u2018KFactor\u2019 can easily mislead consumers,\u201d Sunil Pinnamaneni, Chief Technical Officer of Agritesting laboratories, tells Healthyish.MGO, a measure of how much methylglyoxal is present in the honey, is the most widely known m\u0101nuka honey grading system in the United States. The higher the MGO rating (it maxes out at 1000 mg, which is where things get pricey), the higher the antibacterial strength in the honey. However, MGO grades are determined by the company selling the honey with no third-party market authentication.That lack of oversight led to the creation of The Unique M\u0101nuka Factor Honey Association (UMFHA). It\u2019s an independent third party that devised a grade scale ranging from UMF 5+ to UMF 25+ .\u201cAnyone can put any MGO rating on their honey,\u201d John Rawcliffe, a UMFHA administrator tells Healthyish. \u201cBut to use the UMF you must have a license and follow the set rules and obligations to guarantee authenticity to the customer.\u201dFor a honey manufacturer to acquire a UMF rating, the UMFHA tests for unique compounds found in m\u0101nuka, including leptosperin, which is difficult to adulterate. It\u2019s an important qualifier now that fraudulent producers have developed synthetic methylglyoxal, which can be added to honey to dupe authenticity tests and consumers (yes, that really happens). If a honey tests for MGO but not leptosperin, it\u2019s not real m\u0101nuka. The UMFHA carries out blind marketplace testing to ensure authenticity.Flora's double-certified honey.\nPhoto by Alex LauSome m\u0101nuka honey producers are also working to shape the future of what is projected to become a $1.2 billion industry by 2028.A partnership between the U.S. manufacturer Flora Health and the Te Arawa M\u0101ori tribe of New Zealand\u2019s Onuku M\u0101ori Land Trust sends a percentage of proceeds to support the Te Arawa people. [Editor\u2019s note: In a previous role, Hillary Eaton consulted for Flora Health on social media strategy and social partnerships.] Flora\u2019s honey uses both MGO and UMF labels along with a scannable microchip that provides harvest information, supply chain, and individual UMF lab tests for each jar.As the m\u0101nuka honey industry grows, protection against counterfeiting, product verifiability, and transparency will need to grow too. Lobbyists are pushing the New Zealand\u2019s Ministry of Primary Industries to create more definitive export guidelines, and emerging honey brands seem to be adhering to ingredient transparency. But as in cases of other food fraud around the world (we\u2019re looking at you, Parmesan and wagyu), consumer discretion and education is your number one fail-safe. After all, if you\u2019re going to spend the big bucks on some of the most precious honey in the world, it better be real.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishhoneyNew ZealandTrendsRead MoreLifestyleActivist Manuka Honey Is the Superfood Sweetener We're Obsessed With Right NowBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
