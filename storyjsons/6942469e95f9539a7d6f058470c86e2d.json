Pastry chefs, writers, and others in the food industry are finding more accessible ways to fight the good fight and raise money and awareness for causes they believe in.By Elyse InamineAugust 16, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Danielle AdamsFacebookTwitterEmail\u201cIf you\u2019re a chef in New York City, people ask all the time if you can donate something for an auction or cook for a gala,\u201d says Natasha Pickowicz, the pastry chef behind Caf\u00e9 Altro Paradiso and Flora Bar in New York City. \u201cBut for me, growing up in Southern California, I went to bake sales.\u201dShe remembers the homey presentations, the DIY baked goods, and the casual, convivial atmosphere. That seemed more appealing than the restaurant industry way of doing good, which has typically fallen in the fancy, fundraising gala territory. For chefs, that means lending your services (maybe cooking for the event or auctioning off a special dinner to the highest bidder) but not actually engaging with the cause. For guests, that means you probably need hefty funds to get a seat at the 7-course dinner. That\u2019s not the case with bake sales.\u201cThere are no reservations. You don\u2019t just sit there,\u201d Pickowicz says. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for people to come together in a super casual way, to have a conversation, swap ideas, and get inspiration for the next thing.\u201dWhen it came to figuring out how to give back after the 2016 election, last April, Pickowicz and the team at Matter House, the restaurant group behind Caf\u00e9 Altro Paradiso and Flora Bar, planned a bake sale to raise funds for the Manhattan branch of Planned Parenthood. Pickowicz asked all of her pastry chef and cook friends to make about 50 pastries, show up at Caf\u00e9 Altro Paradiso, and see how it goes. She announced the bake sale on Instagram, not expecting a line around the block. All the baked goods were gone within an hour, they had raised $8,000, and people were already asking about the next one. For round two this year, Pickowicz and her team quadrupled the amount of pastries made (they still sold out along with totes and booze, donated by Enlightenment Wines and Yola Mezcal) and raised $22,000 for Planned Parenthood.\u201cThe charm of this kind of event is that it\u2019s hyper participatory and super low key,\u201d Pickowicz says. \u201cPeople want to help and show up.\u201dWriter Dayna Evans (who also contributes to Bonappetit.com) has experienced this kind of response with the bake sales she\u2019s held at Playground coffee shop in Brooklyn. For the first one, she baked bread out of a rented commercial kitchen and a local pie shop donated some desserts, which raised $5,000 for World Central Kitchen. At Evans\u2019s most recent bake sale, Alison Roman, the cookbook author and former Bon App\u00e9tit editor contributed those famous chocolate chip-shortbread cookies, which sold out. In the end, they raised $10,800 for RAICES in Texas; the Young Center, an organization that helps unaccompanied immigrant children; and Make the Road New York, an immigration and working class reform organization.\u201cI feel frustrated with the idea that bake sales are by design reactionary,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been toying with the idea of having a consistent bake sale once a month dedicated to one particular issue that\u2019s been on the back burner or people aren\u2019t aware of.\u201d Keep an eye out for ongoing bake sales through her new Instagram account, @permanentbakesale.Beyond the exponential growth of the bake sales, what makes it worth it to Pickowicz is the way she can feed her community in a different way.\u201cWhen you\u2019re in a restaurant basement, it can be this myopic environment. You can\u2019t see who you are making food for and you feel like you\u2019re searching for that connection,\u201d she says. \u201cBut with the bake sale, you can go out and meet so many wonderful people, some who haven\u2019t even been to the restaurant but are interested in the cause and willing to donate $5.\u201dThe power of the bake sale is catching on: Chef Ryan Santos plans on adding a charitable component to the all-female pastry chef bake sales he\u2019s been hosting at Please in Cincinnati. \u201cThese initial bake sales were a bit of an experiment, but next season we want to let the women choose a charity of her choice,\u201d Santos says via email. \u201cWe are constantly striving to create a dialogue and expand opportunities for the underserved in our complex world of hospitality.\u201dPickowicz and Evans have also received emails from pastry chefs, cooks, and others across the country, asking how to pull of a bake sale at home. Luckily for them, it\u2019s easy: pick your cause, get your industry friends to bake things, and sell them. The low cost ($1 cookie, $7 loaf of bread) and come-as-you-please flow naturally invites and empowers a new generation of activists. And we\u2019re ready to line up.All fired up?
