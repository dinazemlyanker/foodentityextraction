Your bed.By Tempur-PedicSeptember 11, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailSince Monday morning at 8:00 a.m., you\u2019ve been dreaming of Friday at 6:00 p.m. It\u2019s been a long week\u2013\u2013scratch that, a long month\u2013\u2013and this weekend is yours. Your place is about to become Self-Care Central, with you as the ruling monarch, and all you need are your shows, your bed, recipes you can whip up in a flash, and then: the sleep you\u2019ve been waiting for.The secret? The TEMPUR-breeze\u00b0 mattress. It helps you to sleep deeper, fall asleep faster, feel cooler, and sleep longer throughout the night. Models are designed to feel up to eight degrees cooler*. (*Based on average heat index of TEMPUR-LUXEbreeze compared to TEMPUR-PROAdapt models measured over 8-hour period.) Imagine: As you drift into dreamland, a thermodynamic mattress that activates at 80 degrees to absorb heat. From the moment you lie down, it delivers a cooling sensation up to 30 percent more intense than non-cooling models\u2013\u2013and keeps going. All night long it absorbs heat, continually feeling as you roll over and adjust, even channeling humidity away from your body.With feels ranging from Soft to Medium to Firm, this mattress is a product of more than years and millions of hours of testing by Tempur-Pedic\u2019s thermal, material, and textile engineers. Now you + the bed = ultimate comfort, right down to the perfect temperature. With that, we\u2019ve got your all-weekend strategy for staying in bed. So who\u2019s ready to tuck in?FRIDAY: SORRY NOT SORRY, CAN\u2019T COME OUT TONIGHTA night propped up on pillows finally catching up on Season 2 of your favorite show is just within reach, but first, a plan must be put into place. Need wine? Hot chocolate? Fish or fresh veggies? Stock up on your way home. The goal this weekend is to stay. in. bed.Then, in just a few easy steps, whip up this cauliflower soup with hazelnuts and bacon. It's the perfect stay-home-in-your-sweats dish that won't take too much time. Your shows are calling! This creamy pur\u00e9ed bowl of goodness is made event better with crunchy, salty bacon and toasted hazelnut halves. Bonus: this cruciferous veggie will fill you up and won't make a mess when you're all piled up on top of the covers...but even if you do spill, TEMPUR-breeze\u00b0 mattresses feature a removable, washable cover for quick, easy cleanup.SATURDAY: BRUNCH IN BED SOUNDS NICEA lazy Saturday morning is nothing without coffee and breakfast that\u2019s just the right amount of indulgent. This anything-but-ordinary egg and merguez wrap gets its tang from red onion, dill pickles and mint inside a flour tortilla crisped up with sausage fat. More of a sweets-for-breakfast person? Treat yourself to these ricotta pancakes with blueberry-lemon compote. The secret to the light, fluffy consistency is whipped egg whites, and the ricotta gives these morning mainstays a tangy finish.If your home is Self-Care Central, then an unbeatable night\u2019s sleep\u2013\u2013or a midday nap\u2013\u2013is at the top of the to-do list. Afterwards, consider a gentle, late-afternoon yoga session, bike ride, or leisurely walk to get your blood flowing. It will make leaping back into bed that much more satisfying when you trade your social Saturday night plans for the company of a good book. Round out the night with this fried chicken sandwich, made complete with seasoned mayonnaise, pickles, slaw and hot sauce. It tastes like having a picnic for one, but in bed.SUNDAY: TOO MANY SUNDAY SCARIES, GOTTA STAY INCongratulations, you\u2019ve officially made it to Sunday on some of the best sleep of your life. Less wake-ups, less tossing and turning, and more falling into a deeper sleep, leaving you feeling like you could conquer the world. Shall we consider this mission accomplished?
