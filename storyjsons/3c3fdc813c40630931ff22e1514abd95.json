I made exactly as stated and think the dressing would have been enough for another potato - that\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d do differently. And I will definitely stop by Cracklin B\u2019s BBQ if I\u2019m ever in the area to taste the original. AnonymousRenton, WA7/4/2020This will be my go to Potato Salad Recipe going forward.
