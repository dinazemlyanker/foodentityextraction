Here\u2019s how.By Alex DelanySeptember 18, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailCorn on the cob is one of summer\u2019s simple pleasures, the one vegetable side that we can\u2019t get enough of when it's in season\u2014when it\u2019s cooked properly that is. That\u2019s right: Like many simple things, people do a pretty good job of screwing it up. Learning how to boil corn the right way, so that each kernel is bright and juicy and ready to burst with flavor, is one of the keys to having a good summer. You want to have a good summer? So do we.Let\u2019s get to it. How long do you have to boil corn? Well, it depends entirely on the quality of corn that you\u2019re working with. Are you looking at ears of freshly-picked local corn from the farmers\u2019 market or a roadside stand, or corn from the grocery store that was picked a bit ago and traveled in the back of a truck? Get a big ol\u2019 pot of water on to boil and allow us to explain.See, when fresh corn is at its best, we want to keep it that way, preserving every bit of natural sweetness. When we get extremely fresh local corn, we do this by not cooking it aggressively. All we want to do is heat up the kernels, softening them slightly and making them even more flavorful, but retaining that healthy, juicy pop. So when it comes to boiling fresh corn, the stuff you\u2019d pick up at the farmers\u2019 market, you should only boil it for 2-3 minutes. It doesn\u2019t need any more than that. Promise.In September, corn salad is always the side, no matter the main.\nGrocery store corn, on the other hand, needs a bit longer in the pot. When corn is picked and sits at room temperature (especially if the husks are removed), the natural sugars in the kernels turn to starches. The starches make each kernel tougher and less sweet, which is why they need to be subjected to heat for a longer time to reach a pleasant softness. Out-of-season grocery store corn should boil for 5-8 minutes, depending on how long it\u2019s been sitting. It can obviously be hard to tell exactly how long corn has been sitting around, so tasting it as it cooks isn\u2019t a bad idea.The real moral of the story here, as it is for almost all produce, is that you should buy the freshest, most local corn you can whenever humanly possible. When you start with good corn, the need to fuss and turn it into something else that isn\u2019t there. A couple minutes in boiling water. Some butter. Some salt. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the real way to soak up the last rays of summer.Corn salsa time is now, when the kernels are juicy and sweet.This Corn Salsa Recipe Is Way More Chill Than Your August VacationNothing fancy here.
