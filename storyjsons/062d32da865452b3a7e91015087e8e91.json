Don\u2019t skip the splash of vinegar at the end\u2014it adds an acidity to the broth that helps brighten it and really brings it to life.Ingredients4 servings8cups homemade chicken stock or low-sodium chicken broth4large eggs1lb. asparagus, trimmed, cut into 2\u00bd\" pieces4small carrots, peeled, sliced 1\u00bd\" thick8oz. shiitake mushrooms, stems removed, caps halved8ramps, green and white parts separated, coarsely chopped1cup torn basil leaves1Tbsp. apple cider vinegarKosher salt, freshly ground pepperExtra-virgin olive oil (for drizzling)PreparationStep 1Bring stock to a simmer in a small pot over medium-high heat. Crack an egg into a small bowl, then gently slide egg into stock. (If you want a crystal-clear broth, you can poach the eggs in water instead.) Repeat with remaining eggs, waiting until whites are opaque before adding the next one (about 30 seconds). Poach eggs until whites are set and yolks are still runny, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer eggs to paper towels as they are done.Step 2Reduce heat to medium and return stock to a gentle simmer. Add asparagus, carrots, mushrooms, and white parts of ramps. Cook, stirring occasionally, until asparagus and carrots are tender, 3\u20135 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in basil, vinegar, and ramp greens; season with salt.Step 3Divide broth and vegetables among bowls. Gently slip an egg into each bowl; season with pepper and drizzle with oil.How would you rate Poached Eggs in Chicken Broth with Mixed Vegetables?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (1)Back to TopTriangleSo good! A perfect comfort food dish. I felt so warm and fuzzy inside. My rendition was sort of a poor man's version. I swapped the chicken broth for beef broth (because that's what was in the fridge), added chopped baby carrots, salad lettuce, and ramen noodle soup base mix. Diluted it a little with water, and cooked it. The eggs were a hassle, but I'm just bad at poaching. This recipe will definitely give me a chance to practice! \nThe secret is in the runny yolk. Once I popped the eggs and let the heavenly liquid gold escape, the entire bowl transformed! Don't skip on the egg! Don't skip on the vinegar either -- it gives the broth an Asian flavor. Absolutely love this recipe. I'm excited to try the recipe as written next time I go shopping!RoseNY12/5/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSoupSoups and StewsEggSpringQuickEasyOne-Pot MealsWeeknight MealsMainDairy-FreeNut-FreeGluten-FreeHealthyishSimmerLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
