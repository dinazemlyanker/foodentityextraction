Do not make plans after St. Lawrence, because in true Quebecois fashion, his butter- and foie gras\u2013laden food is guaranteed to put you to bed.ORDER THE: oreilles de Crisse (unless you\u2019re vegetarian!). These crispy fried pork rinds with maple syrup and black pepper are the only way to begin (or perhaps end?) your meal. Go big with the Paris-Brest stuffed with duck liver and foie gras mousse and the tourti\u00e8re, a French-Canadian meat pie which arrives triumphantly garnished with a tiny Montreal Canadiens flag.THE VIBE IS: cozy, filled with everyone from tattooed hipsters to your parents\u2019 cool friends who really know their wine. The restaurant\u2019s small French-speaking staff includes some of the best servers, bartenders, and sommeliers in the city, so you\u2019re sure to feel at home\u2014or at least home in Quebec.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Tuesday to Sunday, from 5:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. Closed Monday. Book ahead since tables fill up quickly.\u2014Lindsay AndersonChris GiannakosChris GiannakosWE ALSO LOVECaf\u00e9 MedinaThe city\u2019s downtown brunch institutionThe Pie ShoppeEast Vancouver\u2019s beloved, scrappy, and downright delicious bakeryChambarCivilized debauchery for breakfast, lunch, and dinner in CrosstownExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
