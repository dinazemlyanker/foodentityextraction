Hands down.\u201dBy Korsha WilsonAugust 6, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailIt\u2019s a warm June night at the James Beard House in New York City and chef Digby Stridiron is playing soca music in the compact subterranean kitchen as cooks move around him putting final touches on a caviar dish with ackee, saltfish, and roti. This is a sold-out dinner celebrating the West Indian Chefs Alliance, showcasing some of the best chefs of the Caribbean.Stridiron is saying hello to guests, giving hugs to people he remembers from last year\u2019s dinner. Someone says \u201cnice outfit\u201d as she passes him on her way to the courtyard. While the other chefs in the kitchen are wearing white chef coats, starched, pressed, and embroidered with their names, Stridiron is wearing a dark blue mechanic\u2019s shirt with a U.S. Virgin Islands flag patch\u2014a golden eagle with outstretched wings\u2014on the left breast pocket.On the surface Stridiron looks the same as he did last year around this time, when he hosted the first W.I.C.A. dinner, save for the patch and a few more tattoos. But the past year has brought challenges and clarity that changed him and the way that he thinks about himself as a chef and a man; he\u2019s more committed than ever to honoring Caribbean cuisine.\u201cThanks,\u201d he says to her over the crowd, cracking a smile. \u201cI\u2019m over that traditional way of doing things.\u201dThe day before the dinner, Stridiron surveyed the shelves at Essex Street Market in Manhattan, in camo shorts and a T-shirt, bleary-eyed from making a 12-hour drive from Charleston, South Carolina, where he picked up a heritage-breed pig from Holy City Hogs, a small heritage pork producer based in South Carolina. This last-minute shopping trip is for citrus and herbs to make the rum cocktails served at the dinner. \u201cWe\u2019re serving rum drinks with each course,\u201d he says excitedly. \u201cThe Japanese are proud of their sake and serve it with their food, so why not serve rum?\u201dDigby Stridiron, 35, is from St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, a territory of the United States. He ran the kitchen at Balter, a fine-dining restaurant, on the island until 2017 and was the U.S. Virgin Islands\u2019 culinary ambassador, traveling the world promoting the islands and their cuisine.Last year he started work as the opening chef at a Charleston restaurant that would serve Caribbean-inspired dishes with local Southern ingredients. He had high hopes for the project: \u201cI was constantly trying to refine my food,\u201d he says. That meant taking sorrel\u2014a tart drink made from Caribbean hibiscus\u2014reducing it and adding sugar to make it more \u201cfamiliar\u201d and modern for diners. He made mofongo, the humble dish of crushed fried plantains, as smooth and creamy as possible instead of the rough mash typically found on the island. Stridiron had looked to places like Noma as a culinary weathervane of how his cooking should be, as if he had to \u201c\u2018French\u2019 things up\u201d or mimic a European standard of dining and cuisine in order to be taken seriously.Just as hype for the restaurant was building in September 2017, Hurricane Maria ripped through the region, destroying homes, downing power lines, and killing dozens of people. Stridiron, who was born and raised on the island and still has family there, felt helpless. \u201cMe being up here when that storm was happening, I couldn\u2019t focus, I wasn\u2019t able to do anything. It killed me. I went gray over this.\u201d Less than two months later his grandmother passed away and he started to rethink his career priorities. \u201cLosing my grandmother was one of the moments that showed me that you have to make decisions that are right, and if it\u2019s not right for you then it\u2019s not meant for you.\u201d A few months later, in March of 2018, Stridiron was fired from the Charleston project without warning before it opened. \u201cIt was embarrassing,\u201d he says.He went back to the Caribbean, traveling to Jamaica to try authentic jerk, to Trinidad to try doubles, to Barbados to try cou-cou and flying fish. \u201cThe most diverse culture in the world is my West Indian culture. Hands down,\u201d he says. He no longer cared about awards or \u201crefining\u201d his dishes. \u201cI took off my chef jacket, and you don\u2019t have to call me a chef if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d he says. \u201cBesides Jose [Enrique of Puerto Rico], there\u2019s not much award recognition in the Caribbean, and it makes Caribbean chefs feel like they have to make our food something different, something more European, and it\u2019s like, no, what we\u2019re doing is already beautiful.\u201d\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been the easiest year for Digby,\u201d says Asha Gomez, chef-owner of Third Space, a culinary event studio in Atlanta. She and Stridiron met four years ago in Italy and have stayed close friends ever since. \u201cI call Digby a crazy diamond,\u201d she says with a smile when talking about Stridiron\u2019s move from St. Croix to Charleston and his travels around the Caribbean. \u201cThe last year has probably been the most important of his life because it\u2019s defined and shaped what he wants to do.\u201dStridiron cooking at the James Beard House in June.\nPhoto by Eric VitaleIn May, a call took Digby back to St. Croix. Sommer Sibilly-Brown, founder of the Virgin Islands Good Food Coalition, asked him to cook for a dinner raising funds for four Crucian middle and high school children to travel to Barbados to learn about the food systems there as part of the Farm to School Initiative. Since he didn\u2019t have to work at a restaurant at the time, he said yes. \u201cI was scared.\u201d Stridiron hadn\u2019t seen the island since the storms. \u201cWhen we flew in, there were a lot of blue roofs,\u201d he remembers. Seeing the damaged homes still covered in tarps made him realize what he wanted to do next and where he needed to be. \u201cWhen I think about the greatest moments of my career, they\u2019re all when I\u2019m back in St. Croix. I realized that everything I had been doing for the past year was about me, it wasn\u2019t about my community. I was being selfish.\u201d\u201cIt was challenging to do that dinner,\u201d Sibilly-Brown remembers. \u201cAfter the hurricane it was really hard to source local ingredients but Digby always said, \u2018don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019\u201d A day before the event, the venue lost water and Sibilly-Brown had no choice but to reschedule the event for a later date causing 50% of the reservations to cancel. \u201cEverything that could have broken his spirit, he took it in stride,\u201d she remembers. \u201cHe kept saying to me, \u2018little by little\u2019 and that\u2019s how we make change.\u201dStridiron recently signed the lease on a space in St. Croix and aims to open his new restaurant, Braata, at the end of 2018. Braata will be the rum bar of his dreams, serving dishes rooted in traditional Caribbean ingredients and highlighting the influence of both African slaves who were brought to the island and the Taino people, or indigenous native Caribbeans. He is designing the space himself and creating a menu that will be 100% Caribbean. \u201cIf I want to make something with cassareep (a thick syrup made with cassava), I want you to taste the cassareep.\u201d Indigenous tropical fruits like sugar apples and traditional pepper pots will also be a part of Braata\u2019s menu. \u201cThis is our food. We don\u2019t need to replicate someone else\u2019s food. Our food is already great.\u201d And he\u2019s not interested in awards. \u201cIf me being in Virgin Islands means there\u2019s not enough people to eat my food to nominate me for an award, then guess what? I\u2019m still fucking golden.\u201dNow the chef is traveling between St. Croix, other Caribbean islands, and cities in the U.S., collaborating on pop-up events and making plans for his restaurant. \u201cDigby finding his way back to the island is really full circle,\u201d Gomez says. \u201cHe lives and breathes that place, and he\u2019s so proud of the food and the culture.\u201d\u201cPersonally, I\u2019m happy that I\u2019m going to have a warrior next to me, someone who loves this island as much as I do,\u201d says Sibilly-Brown, who hosts events in the U.S. Virgin Islands to promote local foodways and farmers. \u201cIt helps young Virgin Islanders see that they can do it too.\u201d\u201cI accepted myself,\u201d Stridiron says. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for anyone to say \u2018Digby, you\u2019re good\u2019 or \u2018Digby, your food is beautiful\u2019 or \u2018we see you\u2019, I want my people to see me everyday.\u201d It took a year of travelling but it feels good to be home, he says. \u201cBefore I\u2019m a chef, I\u2019m a Virgin Islander.\u201dKorsha Wilson is a writer and the host of the podcast A Hungry Society.
