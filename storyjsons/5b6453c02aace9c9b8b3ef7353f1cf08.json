If you're using frozen shrimp, throw them in a resealable bag and set in a bowl of cool running water in the sink\u2014you'll be good to go in 10-15 minutes. When shopping for pineapple, choose one that's fragrant, feels heavy for its size, and gives slightly when pressed at the base.IngredientsMakes 8\u00bdsmall red onion, thinly sliced2tablespoons fresh lime juicePinch of sugarKosher salt\u00bcmedium pineapple, peeled, cored, cut lengthwise into spears, then crosswise \u00bd inch thick (about 2 cups)2tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided1\u00bcpounds shrimp, peeled, deveined1tablespoon SrirachaFreshly ground black pepper8corn tortillas, warmed1avocado, sliced1jalape\u00f1o, very thinly sliced, seeds removed if desired\u00bdcup cilantro leaves with tender stemsLime wedges (for serving)PreparationStep 1Place a rack in the highest position in oven; heat broiler.

The shrimp might have needed more flavor, but that could have been me. We added a mango salsa to increase the sweet/spicy mix. Do recommendAnonymousFairfax, VA9/5/2020Delicious, especially the grilled pineapple. We sadly cannot get as nice shrimp as shown in the picture in our country (at least, not without selling a kidney), but the flavours here more than make up for it. Nice and quick even for a weeknight. Anonymous5/25/2020So easy , so delicious! rosdianeEvanston Illinois4/25/2020We love these. They\u2019re super quick and easy to make and are delicious!
