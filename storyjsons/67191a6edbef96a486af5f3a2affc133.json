From the outside, it could be any of the thousands of old-school slice joints that dot the city, complete with the classic red-and-blue bubble-lettered sign capped with a phone number, the neon beer sign, and the dark, wood-paneled walls and stained glass light fixtures visible through the window. As I go inside, certain details become clearer: the pizza boxes made of recycled material, the impressive board of organic wines on offer, and the sheer number of Opening Ceremony-clad models packed into the booths.Then the pizza arrives. At first glance, it could be just another New York slice: thin, wide-brimmed, with a rippled coating of cheese hiding a schmear of tomato sauce. But I quickly realize it\u2019s much more special: the complex texture, the light-as-air crust, the weirdly wholesome feeling I have even after eating an entire personal pie. This close-to-perfect pizza, as I found out, is the result of what happens downstairs in the tiny, all-white basement: Owner Scarr Pimentel mills his own grains. Every. Single. Day.Owner Scarr Pimentel standing next to his basement grain mill.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanPimentel is not your typical pizzaiolo\u2014he\u2019s neither the wizened Italian dude of the old guard nor a lanky, tattooed young gun. He\u2019s a 38-year-old Dominican-American guy dressed in a black hoodie and Champion sweatpants who loves to complain about mediocre pizza places (of which, he says, there are many). He has just returned from a trip to Los Angeles, for example, where he claims he had \u201cthe worst pizza of my life\u2014even the places that were hyped and expensive were terrible.\u201dHe is a die-hard New Yorker, having lived here most of his life and seen the city through much of its ever-evolving pizza scene. He cut his teeth at many of the pizza greats: Joe\u2019s, Artichoke, GG\u2019s, Lombardi. \u201cBack then,\u201d he says, \u201cevery pizza by the slice place was good to amazing. Now, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d He claims that about a decade ago, a lot of the old-school spots started cutting corners, hoping customers wouldn\u2019t notice. They added sugar to their tomato sauce, sourced meats from questionable origins, and committed the most cardinal sin of all in Pimentel\u2019s mind: using flour laced with chemicals that improved its yield. Even worse, they stopped fermenting their dough\u2014the process that allows the glutens in the flour to activate, yielding a light crust. \u201cWhy does pizza have to be considered a bad food?\u201d he says. \u201cWhy do you have to use garbage ingredients?\u201d And yet, he adds, incredulously, people still flocked to these heritage joints. \u201cNothing against these old spots, but they suck,\u201d he deadpans. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna wait three hours for that? I just didn\u2019t understand the culture of pizza.\u201dMeanwhile, Pimentel was reading up on people like Chad Robertson from Tartine and Chris Bianco of Pizzeria Bianco who were taking the time to use the best ingredients and make pizzas and breads that were carefully plotted at every point.So, when it came time to open his own pizza joint, he decided he was going to go a step further than all the other New York slice joints. \u201cI wanted to future proof this method, and get ahead of the class,\u201d he says. Not only was he going to source good ingredients, he was going to mill his own flour.Here\u2019s why: Wheat is packed with nutrients, but those nutrients start dying when exposed to oxygen. By milling wheat berries fresh, he\u2019s preserving those nutrients in the pizza, making it more airy and digestible.The outside of Scarr's Pizza\nPhoto by Emma FishmanAt first, the pizza dough at Scarr\u2019s was made entirely with those milled wheat berries, a process Pimentel completed himself in a large, dusty, white miller each day. \u201cAnd then we got busy,\u201d he says, which prompted him to find a less time-consuming compromise. He now buys flour from a farm in upstate New York (he won\u2019t tell me which one for fear of copy cats) that grows heritage, organic, non-GMO wheat and combines that with the flour he mills himself. The process is hilariously old-school: Pimentel adds the berries to the miller, turns on a rusty switch dangling from the wall, and after they have been finely ground, adds the flour from the farm and lets it all sift through an extremely fine sieve. Flour spills all over Pimentel\u2019s black sweatshirt as he reaches into the mill and pulls out the freshly sifted grains, which feel like silk. The flour gets mixed with water and fermented for a few days, then it\u2019s ready to be baked.The result of this time-consuming process is a more nutrient-dense pizza that, Pimentel claims, even gluten-free folk can eat. \u201cThere is this perception that wheat is bad for you,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the reason we have gluten intolerances is because we\u2019ve been eating Wonder Bread with chemical flour our whole lives.\u201d This is probably why the models are flocking to Scarr\u2019s, he explains. \u201cBecause you can eat a slice here and not feel like shit.\u201dI ask Pimentel why he hasn\u2019t advertised the milling practices at Scarr\u2019s. He seems to revel in having people come in with lowered expectations because of how the place looks on the outside. \u201cPeople assume that we will be a shitty slice spot,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t see a ninety-year-old man making pizza. They see a Dominican man and they\u2019re like \u2018What do you know about pizza?\u2019\u201dAnd then they taste the grandma pie, whose crust brims with air bubbles and shatters like glass, with their pet nat in hand, NBA memorabilia surrounding them, as Usher blares on the speakers.
