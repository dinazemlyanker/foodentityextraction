In her monthly column, nearly lifelong vegetarian Sarah Jampel will tackle cooking, eating, and navigating the world meat-free\u2014even when her grandma still doesn't know what she makes for dinner.My greatest shame\u2014and biggest secret\u2014as a nearly lifelong vegetarian is that once every two months or so, I eat fish. And most often, it\u2019s because I\u2019m somewhere that\u2019s known for its seafood\u2014like a fancy restaurant or a shoreside lobster shack in Maine.I\u2019m sure that a lot of you are thinking that these occasional forays into the sea mean that I\u2019m can\u2019t call myself a vegetarian at all. Which, okay, fair enough. But humans are complex, and labels are simplistic\u2014our imperfect-but-necessary linguistic methods for translating that complexity into words. I say that my seafood consumption is a shameful secret because I know that diehard vegetarians will no longer consider me one of them. But I\u2019m not ready to give up that part of my identity for those four or five \u201cspecial situation fish\u201d per year.Throughout my life, what it has meant to be a vegetarian has grown as I have. When I first stopped eating meat, I was simply a six-year-old lemming, blindly following my older sister in her thoughtful decision. When I was in elementary school, I loved animals and had approximately 30 pig stuffed animals, none of whom I could imagine as bacon. In middle school, my dietary habits set me apart from my group of friends; it was cool. When I was in high school, college, and young adulthood, vegetarianism finally became a more informed decision: If I didn\u2019t have the time, energy, or financial resources to source my meat and fish in an environmentally responsible way, I wouldn\u2019t eat it.My decision to eat fish wasn\u2019t spontaneous or random\u2014it was spurred by travel, curiosity, FOMO, and all of the exciting, uncomfortable feelings that come with putting yourself in an unfamiliar environment. I was on a trip to Japan with three friends, the furthest from home I\u2019d ever been, and we were lucky enough to eat at a handful of hushed and elegant omakase restaurants. At that point, it had been at least 15 years since I\u2019d had fish (had I ever had fish?), but it seemed silly to have traveled halfway around the world, to a place I probably wouldn\u2019t return to for years and where fish is treated with incredible care and attention, and turn away piece after piece of sashimi. So I dove in: red snapper, tuna, salmon, eel...I ate it all.And even though a large part of my identity was called into question (NBD), I had one of the most carefree, fun, and well-rounded trips of my life. Instead of obsessing about every meal, worrying whether I\u2019d find something to eat at a fish-heavy restaurant or if I could convince my friends to trek to a veg-friendly spot, I was able, for practically the first time in my life, to go with the flow. I had set my limits\u2014no meat\u2014but I had also opened up enough to feel like I could begin to experience at least some of what Japanese food is renowned for. The trip didn\u2019t make me a regular fish-eater\u2014it didn\u2019t even make me want to try seafood on my next vacation\u2014but it did help me to rethink how I eat when I\u2019m traveling internationally.Here\u2019s what works for me: First, I try to decide what I\u2019m going to do ahead of time, before I leave. It doesn\u2019t need to be a written manifesto, but it does help me to mentally prepare if I\u2019ve set my boundaries prior to departure. Plus, if I\u2019ve decided for myself, I can also better communicate my needs to my travel partners (no, I don\u2019t need to find a special restaurant; no, I\u2019m not okay with eating street food that, 80:20 odds, contains pork; yes, I\u2019m fine with bonito).Then, I learn the words for what I won\u2019t eat or, if pronunciation is hopeless, write them on an index card (or in a note in my phone) so that I feel ready to communicate. I accept the answers I get and decide if risking a mistake is worth it to me.I\u2019ll also do a lot of research ahead of time. In some cases, that might mean choosing to go to countries that are particularly vegetarian-friendly (spending time in India and Indonesia, for example, was fairly easy) or specific subsets within a cuisine that are meat-free, like temple food in Japan. In other instances, it\u2019s browsing restaurant menus ahead of time or finding food tours or cooking classes that accommodate vegetarians. I decide which out-of-the-way veg restaurants seem worth my time (the vegan ramen place in Tokyo Station, for example) and if there are any nearby sights or activities that would make the special trip even more worthwhile.And, most importantly for me personally, I let some things go. When I went to Vietnam, I accepted that fish sauce was going to be nearly unavoidable. It was one less ingredient to worry about, and it seemed like a small concession to make compared to how many dishes became permissible. A whole world opened up when I stopped crossing any dish seasoned with fish sauce off my list.Oh, and I bring snacks!  I\u2019ll pack energy bars so that I can feed myself in desperate times and I\u2019ll make a stop at a convenience or grocery store for a selection of packaged items (the advantage being that it\u2019s usually at least a little easier to figure out what ingredients they contain).These tips help me relax when I\u2019m traveling and focus less on what I\u2019m eating and more on what I\u2019m seeing and learning, but obviously it\u2019s all about the individual: If you\u2019re a vegetarian because of allergies or religious scripture, you\u2019re not going to be loosey-goosey, no matter what. I talked to a kosher friend who said just thinking about eating pork made her upset; my other vegetarian friend went to Taiwan and, to her knowledge, had no fish\u2014even in flake or sauce form\u2014the whole time. You get to decide what being a vegetarian means to you and how that changes depending on where you are in life and the world.As for me, I\u2019ll eat bonito flakes in Kyoto if it means I can eat more miso soup. And, at least in my mind, that doesn\u2019t make me any less of a vegetarian when I get home.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishThe Not Depressing VegetarianessayRead MoreLifestyleWhy It\u2019s Terrible to Be a Vegetarian at a Wedding (And How to Make It Better)By Sarah JampelRecipes you want to make.
