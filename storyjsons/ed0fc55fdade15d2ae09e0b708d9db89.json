See our past recommendations here!It was with a fair shake of skepticism that I tried Slow Up's sweet and savory \u201cfresh food bars\u201d made from fruits, vegetables, and grains. Could these tiny beige squares really compete with a freshly prepared snack? But considering my big domestic goddess energy ran dry in June, and I still wanted to feed myself nourishing things without blowing my budget on Seamless, I figured it was worth a shot. Approximately 14 to 17 bars in, I\u2019m a convert.With 11 grams of protein and only three grams of sugar on average per bar, Slow Up bars are objectively better for me than pretty much everything in the snack aisle. They\u2019re also vegetarian, gluten-free, and tucked inside colorful, compostable packaging. My favorite bar, poblano black bean, is made only of ingredients I can pronounce\u2014like almonds, egg, quinoa, corn, vegetables, and honey\u2014and tastes like a vegetal grain bowl that\u2019s been whizzed up and compressed into a palm-size square. The Calabrian chili lemon flavor is pleasantly spicy and noticeably packed with pine nuts, and the cacao almond is dark and nutty, like a less sweet (but still chocolaty) brownie. Texturally, they\u2019re similar to a firm frittata, with a snappy exterior and spongy middle.The one trade-off with fresh ingredients is that they\u2019re perishable. \u201cGood food goes bad,\u201d head chef Caroline Schiff says. \u201cThere are only a few ways to make something last for a long time out of the fridge\u2014dry it, pack it with sugar or salt, or pump it full of chemical preservatives or acids.\u201d That\u2019s why Slow Up bars are designed to stay in the fridge, where they\u2019ll last up to 14 days. (Not to worry\u2014if you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ll finish the variety pack long before its expiration date.)When I need to get a jump start on lunch, I\u2019ll cube up the poblano bar and sprinkle it over lettuce with grated cheese, or crisp it up in the toaster and top it with a fat hunk of avocado and a drizzle of olive oil. But even when I\u2019m too frazzled to do anything but open and chew, Slow Up bars don\u2019t let me down.\u00a0Photo courtesy of Slow UpSlow Up Bars Variety Box$39 at Slow UpSlow Up ships to most parts of the Northeast U.S.\u00a0Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish Loves ItShoppingSnackRead MoreshoppingI Can't Start the Day Without Crunchy Sprouted BuckwheatBy Amber GibsonRecipes you want to make.
