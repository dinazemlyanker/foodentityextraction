The device eliminates any worry about over- or undercooking, and each one will be perfect. Read more about what sous vide cooking is, and see how to cook anything sous vide with step-by-step photos here.Ingredients2 servings114\u201316-ounce boneless strip steak (1\u00bd\u20132 inches thick)\u00bcteaspoon garlic powder\u00bcteaspoon onion powder1teaspoon kosher salt, plus more\u00bcteaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more3sprigs rosemary3sprigs thyme1tablespoon grapeseed or other neutral oilSpecial EquipmentA sous vide machine; a 1-gallon vacuum-sealable or resealable plastic bagPreparationStep 1Clip (or stand) sous vide machine to a tall large pot. Fill pot with warm water to height according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions (keep in mind that steaks when added will cause water to rise).Photo by Alex LauStep 2Rub steak on all sides with garlic powder, onion powder, 1 tsp. salt, and \u00bc tsp. pepper. Place steak in bag.ChevronChevronStep 3Lightly bruise rosemary and thyme by smacking them against a cutting board or lightly rolling in your hands (this will helps release the volatile oils). Add herbs to bag.Photo by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Anna BillingskogStep 4Vacuum seal or partially close resealable bag, getting as much air out as possible to keep bag from floating, and place in water bath. If using a resealable plastic bag, push down into water to submerge (this will push more air out of the bag) and fully close. To ensure proper cooking, contents of the bag need to be completely submerged in water. Turn on machine and heat water to 130\u00b0. This temperature will give you a tender, perfectly medium-rare steak (adjust 5\u00b0 either way if you like your meat more or less well done).ChevronChevronStep 5Using a small clip, secure top edge of resealable bag to rim of pot, positioning it opposite the machine\u2019s water outlet; as the water circulates, it will help keep the bag submerged. If using a vacuum-sealed bag, you may need to set a small plate on top to prevent floating. Cook steak, maintaining water bath at 130\u00b0, 2\u00bd hours. Remove bag from water bath and let steak rest in bag 15 minutes (this lets the steak absorb some of the juices).Photo by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Anna BillingskogStep 6Remove steak from bag and pat dry with paper towels. Season all over with salt and pepper. Let air-dry a few minutes.Photo by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Anna BillingskogStep 7Heat a large cast-iron skillet over high until very hot. Add oil and cook all 4 sides of steak until a nice crust forms, 1\u20132 minutes total (it happens fast, so don\u2019t walk away). The steak is already perfectly cooked; this step is to get some color and texture on the exterior. Slice steak against the grain, if desired, and season with salt and pepper. (The steak may appear slightly gray when you first cut into it but will turn bright pink when exposed to air.)Photo by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Anna BillingskogStep 8Do Ahead: Steak can be cooked in water bath 4 days ahead. Keep sealed in bag and chill, or freeze up to 1 month. Reheat with sous vide machine at 100\u00b0 until warmed through, about 1 hour, before searing.How would you rate Simple Sous Vide Steak ?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (1)Back to TopTriangleGreat technique.
