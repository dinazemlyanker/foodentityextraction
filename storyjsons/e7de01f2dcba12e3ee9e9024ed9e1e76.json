But technically, the first word of the name is the Korean idiom that transliterates as sohn-mat. Per Hong, \u201cSohn means hand and mat means taste, and the translation is \u2018handmade taste\u2019 or \u2018taste of the hands.\u2019 \uc190\ub9db is when you see an old Korean lady macerating cabbage to make kimchi; her hands are putting that flavor in there.\u201dHong at the counter\nPhoto by Kyle JohnsonEvery bite you\u2019ll eat at By Tae bears the imprimatur of Hong\u2019s hands, and I mean that in the most appetizing way possible. It works like this: You show up to the counter at 11:30 a.m. and scribble your name on the sign-up sheet for one of three seatings. (\uc190\ub9db By Tae serves only lunch, only on weekdays.) When the counter originally opened, the idea was to serve a hand-roll set: three generous rolls for $25. But on my visit, the meal started with soft tofu heaped with fresh pea shoots, two perfect bites of nigiri, and a paper cup of miso soup\u2014before the succession of nori-wrapped handrolls bursting with scallops and pop-y salmon roe began. Hong seemed to know most of the other folks seated at the counter, bantering with some bros from the upstairs co-working space while seemingly simultaneously handling the rice, slicing the day\u2019s fish, and ringing up to-go bento-box orders.In this era of the status omakase, the whole experience was so refreshingly...chill. Not to mention way more delicious and finessed than I expected from a lunch that cost barely more than my typical high-concept grain bowl (she says with shame).Go there: \uc190\ub9db By TaeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendSeattleRestaurantsRecipes you want to make.
