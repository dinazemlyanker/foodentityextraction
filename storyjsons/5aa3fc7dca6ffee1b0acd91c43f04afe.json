Have a question? Email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.Is it ever okay to step in and take over grilling duties from the host to save a skirt steak from a certain dry, chewy death? \u2014Professional PeteIf you work in food in some professional capacity, you might feel you\u2019re better at ~entertaining~ than...everyone else. However, you\u2019re a mere mortal. If you\u2019d like to step in, get near the grill, and peer at the meats. Ask the host, \u201cSooo, whattya makin here?\u201d Then follow up with detailed, annoying questions about how long they marinated the meat, what kind of salt they prefer, whether they like to smash or grate garlic, what their burger ratio is, etc, until they give in/up and offer you the tongs. You may NOT take the tongs without being invited. Let the meat burn, for all I care! This ain\u2019t your castle, burger king!Men think they\u2019re better at grilling than I am (I\u2019m not a man). How do I let them know that I\u2019ll be the only person \u201cmanning\u201d the grill at my place? \u2014Female FranSounds like you might know Pete. If he gets too close to the coals and starts talking about smashing garlic, tell him to run inside and fetch you a Negroni. Then he\u2019ll know where he stands in this house.Put those hands to WORK.\nPeden + MunkSay I\u2019m hosting dinner and I really have things under control, but my guests offer to help. Can I just say no? \u2014Independent IreneYou think they genuinely want to help? LOL. Don\u2019t let them off the hook! Open your laptop, click on the \u201cPromotions\u201d tab in Gmail, and kindly ask your friend to please unsubscribe you from everything except the Bon App\u00e9tit newsletter. Hand another friend your Internet bill and see if they can get Fios at no extra charge. Give another the vacuum. By the time dinner\u2019s ready, you\u2019ll be exactly where you started! Alone.What do you do if you\u2019re having a party and someone you invited either tells you to invite two other relatives or goes ahead and invites them? \u2014At Capacity CelineThis is against the LAW\u2014even if they\u2019re inviting family with the same strands of subpar DNA. No extra invites allowed! Only the host sends invites, and only the host gets to spark lifelong feuds, pointless rifts, and petty grudges.When offered a chocolate bonbon, do you take the chocolate along with the paper cup, or do you take only the piece of chocolate? \u2014Detailed DoreenI\u2019m so glad someone finally had the nerve to ask this question. Take the little paper cup, please, and then hold the bonbon in your palm and sigh, deeply and introspectively. Then pick up the chocolate and take a tiny bite to see if the filling is to your liking. If it\u2019s something like raspberry, place the little cup and half-eaten morsel back into the box and tell the host, \u201cNo thanks.\u201dThis potato salad has been sitting out at 80 degrees for over an hour. Mmmmmm. Would eat.\nPhoto by Peden + Munk, food styling by Sue Li, prop styling by Rebecca BartosheskyIs it ever okay to ask how long a suspiciously warm potato salad/tuna salad has been out in the sun? Not trying to second guess my friend's judgement but also not trying to get food poisoning. \u2014Worry Wart WandaThe tuna\u2019s fiiiiiiiine.A friend of mine (definitely not me) sweats a lot when the temperature surpasses 75 degrees. What are some ways he can survive summer cookouts? \u2014Moist MikeyWear more mesh!Nighttime parties have a natural end point. Daytime parties go on and on and on. Can I kick people out even if it\u2019s 7 p.m.? \u2014Sleepytime T.Daytime parties should end at 5 so people can go home, take a quick nap, and then wonder where the day went. To signal that you want people to leave, tell them there\u2019s been a sewage incident, \u201csomeone from the city is coming,\u201d and that if they start to feel faint, they should hit up urgent care. Put a sign on the bathroom with a skull and crossbones. Tell people there\u2019s \u201csomething in the ice.\u201d Start itching your elbows and howling in little yaps. Ask: \u201cIs it a full moon tonight or just...waning\u2026\u201d Watch them leave and never return.How can you look kinda-cool when you can\u2019t drink alcohol at a social event? Sparkling water can only do so much. \u2014Phobic PhanHerewith, the best non-alcoholic bevs to add to the cooler:A growler of kombuchaTwo liter of Hawaiian punchMexican CokeHomemade spicy limeadeAgua de JamaicaGallon of Turkey Hill iced teaA pony keg of root beerDiet ginger aleKeep far from burgers.\nAndrew KnowltonI'm a picky-as-hell vegetarian, and I don't want my vegetables to be grilled in charred meat remnants. How can I communicate that politely, or should I just clean the grill myself? \u2014Leafy LaurenBring a gift of a nice grill basket, and when you hand it over, say, \u201cI love these because then you can grill vegetables without having the veg touch meat bits, which is great for vegetarians!\u201d And they\u2019ll realize something they perhaps have never thought before. Or they\u2019ll toss the grill basket in the garage and cook your green beans in burger flecks after all. Hard to say.My in-laws are sporadic about serving alcohol at their get-togethers, for no particular reason. Can I bring my own...and then drink it? \u2014Thirsty TaraBring wine! And when dinner begins, stand on your chair and announce: \u201cI\u2019m opening a bottle of Cupcake Chardonnay, does anyone want any?!\u201d Just don\u2019t be covert about it, otherwise the in-laws might get more concerned about you than they already are.How do you tell people that they shouldn\u2019t use the ice cubes that are in the cooler for their drinks (you know, the stuff keeping the drinks cold)? \u2014Icy IsabellaSprinkle cayenne pepper on it, like you do to keep your cat from peeing on the indoor plants.That\u2019s all for now, but if you have petty etiquette questions or recipe requests for me, email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com and be too specific.
