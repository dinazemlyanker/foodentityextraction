Everything was black: ice cream, toothpaste, even water. It doesn't take much to launch a crazy-colored food trend, but what is activated charcoal anyway? And when we saw the laundry list of health claims (Whiter teeth! Purified air! General \"detoxing!\"), we had even more questions. Namely: Are these seemingly endless uses too good to be true?Okay, what\u2019s activated charcoal?Activated charcoal is processed to create small pores that increase charcoal's surface area available for adsorption, a.k.a. the adhesion of molecules to the surfaces they come in contact with. (Adsorption draws molecules to a surface kinda like a magnet; absorption works like a sponge)  This process is typically created through exposure to high heat, namely burning materials like oak and coconut shells. Once charcoal is \u201cactivated,\u201d it can be used in anything from soap and towels to natural air purifiers and, yes, our food.This air purifier uses activated charcoal to filter odors and chemicals. Plus it looks super cool.\nPhoto by Alex LauWhat\u2019s it good for?\u201cActivated charcoal has long been used in hospitals to remove poison from the gastrointestinal tract before it's absorbed into the body,\u201d says Maya Feller Ms, RD, CDN. Charcoal has made the jump from poison control and ER rooms to wellness-minded cafes over the past few years, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should be adding it to your supplement rotation. Activated charcoal may be advertised as a \u201cdetoxifier\u201d for fixing hangovers and overindulging on french fries, but it doesn\u2019t just target \u201cbad\u201d particles\u2014it sucks up whatever it can get, including valuable nutrients and even medication. \u201cThere is some evidence that activated charcoal has been shown to bond to vitamins, which means it may remove them from your system,\u201d says Feller. \u201cI would caution against daily use especially for people that are taking prescription medications or supplements.\u201dBut what about those trendy black drinks? \u201cThere's no evidence that activated charcoal is beneficial when consumed on an everyday basis for the general population,\u201d says Feller. \u201cThe amount of activated charcoal included in detox drinks is usually not substantial enough to make a difference one way or the other, and any purported health benefits are likely negated by the bonding of the charcoal to the nutrients in the drink.\u201d In other words, drinking a charcoal latte before or after a meal can potentially limit the amount of nutrients your body actually gets and even render prescriptions like oral contraceptives ineffective.If you do want to reap the benefits of activated charcoal, it's safest to stick to using it outside your body. Try using it as a water filter to reduce chlorine and balance water pH, in body towels to pull dirt out of pores, or even as an all-natural cleanser. Just don't expect the charcoal soft-serve to make you healthier.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishCharcoalTrendsRead MoreLifestyleA Nutritionist\u2019s Guide to Safer, Smarter SupplementingBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
