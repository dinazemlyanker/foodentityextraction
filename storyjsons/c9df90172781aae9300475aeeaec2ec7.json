RossNovember 25, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Prop Styling by Elizabeth JaimeFacebookTwitterEmailOn paper, Thanksgiving is an easy holiday. There aren\u2019t a dozen boxes of decor to bring down from the rafters, no presents to buy people you barely know, and no religious hoops to jump through. But if John Hughes has taught us anything (aside from how high school sucks) it\u2019s that no holiday is truly easy. Thanksgiving is an unpredictable shuffle of relatives and relationships and unwanted air travel. And then there\u2019s the meal. The only element you can ever completely control is the bottle of wine you're bringing to dinner. Here are five reliable styles to take to the most uncertain of tables this season:For the Friend of a Friend's: P\u00e9tillant-NaturelSometimes Thanksgiving gets random, and that\u2019s fine because you have p\u00e9tillant-naturel, Champagne\u2019s more casual cousin. With its soft bubbles, a punch of acidity, and touch of residual sugar, pet-nat is a great way to start dinner and conversations with total strangers.Strekov's Creme is the perfect Thanksgiving pet-nat.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigFor the In-Laws to Impress: Burgundy Pinot NoirPinot Noir from Burgundy complements everything on the table of your (fingers-crossed) future in-laws. But you don\u2019t have to shell out the big bucks. New Burgundy producers sell more accessible versions (Think $30-$40) that are just as expressive. The in-laws will know the region and the grape, and you\u2019ll be sneaking winks to your significant other as they praise your excellent taste.For the Traditional Family Round-Robin: Ros\u00e9You know the bar at your loud, crowded, full-family Thanksgiving will inevitably be filled with watery Pinot Grigios and overpowering Cabernets, so bring a ros\u00e9 (one that leans more savory in flavor) that will elevate your grandmother\u2019s cranberry sauce. Bonus: It\u2019s nearly a crime not to love ros\u00e9 these days, so it\u2019s also a crowdpleaser!Domaine Philippe's Ros\u00e9 is an excellent choice for Thanksgiving wine.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigFor the Proud Unconventionalist Thanksgiving: Skin-Contact White WineSome people just don\u2019t serve turkey. Maybe it\u2019s a deer they hunted that week, or a whole fish they got at the market at 4 a.m, or suddenly they\u2019re vegan. Who\u2019s to say?! A skin-contact white wine can handle it all\u2014with enough acidity to drink alongside lighter entrees and the tannic structure to stand up to bolder dishes.For the Leftovers: LambruscoYou\u2019re not serving this wine at dinner. You\u2019re hiding it away in the refrigerator, until lunch the next day. Rich in flavor but refreshing, it pairs perfectly with turkey sandwiches and mashed potatoes on the couch in your pajamas (and celebrating getting your parents out of the guest bedroom).Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishThanksgivingnatural wineWineessayRead MoreLifestyleYou're Not Going to Believe I'm Saying This, But Merlot Is BackBy Marissa A.
