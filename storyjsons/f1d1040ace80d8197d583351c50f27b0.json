Wander into the swanky, velvet-lined lobby for a sight, we\u2019ll admit, more stunning that 1 World Trade. GKV Architects and Martin Brudnizki Design Studio transformed the sleepy office building into a golden-hued, 287-room hotel, connected by inner balconies that make the atrium the focal point. Come for the sun-drenched space, but stay for the star-studded hotel restaurants\u2014Tom Colicchio\u2019s veg-forward Temple Court and Keith McNally\u2019s French bistro-like Augustine\u2014and a very good night's sleep.THE VIBE IS: a little nutty, but the masters of New York City hospitality got you. The restaurants can fill up quickly at prime time with tourists and bankers, but just put your name down at either of the restaurants, then hit up the bar in that stunning lobby for liquid destressing supplied by Temple Court.PRACTICAL STUFF: Rates start at $350.\u2014Elyse InamineAlex LauWE ALSO LOVEVoyager EspressoThe futuristic Aussie cafe hidden in a Lower Manhattan subway stationKeens SteakhouseNYC\u2019s classic midtown steakhouse\u2014still perfect after all these yearsArcade BakeryThe Tribeca office building bakery of your dreamsExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
