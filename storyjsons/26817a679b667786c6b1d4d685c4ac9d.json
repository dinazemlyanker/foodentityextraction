Save any extra dressing for marinating smashed cucumbers and dipping dumplings.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Alex Canada 1/5/2022Our cooking club made this and here's the results:  Good dish, but a little salty, would cut down on the salt, Agreed, would use less salt since the soy sauce has salt, Very good! Good, but salty, Very good, but salty.  Very good, Very good!Liz PetersonLutz, Florida10/31/2021I had high hopes for this dish, but found it to be pretty underwhelming. As others have comments, it was far too oily -- the otherwise pleasant piquancy of the sauce totally lost in a sea of oil. Disappointed, and would not make again as written. fmColumbus, OH10/24/2021Awesome weeknight meal that is easy but still packs a lot of flavor. I enjoy it served hot and cold. Dana Denver10/12/2021The second time around, I used 1/4 cup Chinese light soy sauce and a teaspoon of dark soy instead of tamari (which seemed like a weird choice to begin with for Sichuan noodles). This improved the sauce, which was too loose and salty as written. Better color, too! I'll be making this again, and probably try swapping in different seasonal vegetables.Anonymous9/26/2021We quite liked this. The sweetness of the corn and beans is a nice balance for the spices in the dressing. It is a light meal and would be a great dish to bring to a picnic or use as a  side to meat or chicken at a BBQ. Will definitely are again especially if I can find the Sichuan peppercorns!LynneWV9/21/2021Too much oil and WAY too much tamari, but tastes pretty good. Would halve both.  I added soft tofu cubes, which I boiled in the same water. More work than I expected but if the dressing had been pre-made this would be a quick meal. BeccaNYC9/21/2021Entirely too much oil, wish I had used half, but....really delicious.   I upped the peppercorns because I love them.  and there is no substitute for sichuan peppercorns, they are a flavor and sensation all their own.  I digress....this is delicious!  I tossed in some lime juice to cut the oil.  Didn't bother with the corn or beans.  Also used Chinese vinegar vs Balsamic.  even though I made changes I don't think I changed the essence of this dish and will be making this all the timeJane ABostonian displaced in NOVA9/20/2021So refreshing to have the Sichuan pepper corn at home. Me and my GF loved it. She's over here breathing heavy from the spice. It wasn't clear why the recipe called for 1 cup of oil, but it makes sense if you save some of the dressing for other recipes. I used 1/2 cup. It might benefit from an ingredient that gives it some crunch, like peanut in the oil dressing. Also it was simply fun to make. Enjoy!PrikonDurham, NC9/17/2021Upfront I will say I did not have the peppercorn but researched substitutes and I used the ground pepper and coriander seeds ground. The dressing needs help in this recipe.  I cut the oil in half. Next time below I are the ingredients I will increase: 8 Scallions, not 4, 6chopped garlic cloves, 2 TBLs Rice Vinegar, 4 TBLs Balsamic, 2 TBLS chopped ginger (add) , 2 TBLs Sambal (add), 1 tsp sesame oil. Make sure you use 8 oz of pasta. JackieNJ9/6/2021Wow, the dressing! So outstanding and it made A LOT.  I was apprehensive, since Sichuan peppercorns are not something that I've liked in the past, but the effect was very subtle and not too tingly. I was also tempted to cut the oil in half, since a cup is a lot, but it all worked out. A perfect work lunch.
