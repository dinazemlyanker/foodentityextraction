Up next, the \u2018Hannah Swensen Mysteries.\u2019For me nothing is better in winter weather than a cozy mystery book. My favorite series is the Hannah Swensen Mysteries by Joanne Fluke, which follows a baker and amateur sleuth who runs the Cookie Jar bakery and solves crimes in the fictional town of Lake Eden, Minnesota.The first book in the series I read was Red Velvet Cupcake Murder. I was at a bookstore when the cupcake-adorned cover caught my attention from the shelves. The story begins with the grand reopening of the Albion Hotel, which Hannah caters with her famous red velvet cupcakes. But the event takes a dramatic turn as a guest is found dead and Hannah is the prime suspect when the police discover the victim ate a red velvet cupcake with tranquilizers baked into it. To clear her name and find out who really committed the crime, Hannah begins her own investigation. Meanwhile, she\u2019s caught in a love triangle between Norman, a dentist, and Mike, a detective on the police force. The theme of red velvet cupcakes drew me in, but the charm of everything\u2014the setting, characters, and story\u2014kept me reading.But the cream-cheese-frosted crimes don\u2019t end there! Each book in the series offers a different mystery centered around a different dessert. From cookies to cakes to muffins, there\u2019s one for every sweet tooth. In addition to Red Velvet Cupcake Murder, I\u2019m a fan of Strawberry Shortcake Murder, Chocolate Chip Cookie Murder, and, mmm, Blackberry Pie Murder. Each of these mysteries also includes recipes for Hannah\u2019s baked goods for readers to try out for themselves. Red Velvet Cupcake Murder, for instance, features recipes such as Red Velvet Surprise Cupcakes, Tickled Pink Lemonade Cookies, and Double Whammy Lemon Cake.The series boasts dozens of titles; Fluke\u2019s first Hannah Swensen book was Chocolate Chip Cookie Murder, published in 2000, and the latest, Caramel Pecan Roll Murder, will be released in February. Fluke\u2019s fans call her \u201cthe queen of culinary capers\u201d\u2014and her stories have shown me just how cozy mysteries can be when food is at the heart of them.Photograph by Isa ZapataRed Velvet Cupcake Murder$8 at Kensington Books$8 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make.
