Sure, not all of us can manifest a window (and requisite dreamy landscape) in front of our kitchen sinks, or install a custom range hood in our rental apartments. But fear not: with some clever lighting solutions and playful design elements, we can learn to make the most of what we\u2019ve got. And designer Elizabeth Roberts is here to show us how. With a track record packed with historically sensitive renovations, Roberts and her Brooklyn-based firm are no strangers to working within plenty of constraints. Her philosophy leans into new materials, open and breathable vibes, and joy-inspiring touches\u2014without compromising the character of the kitchen she\u2019s restoring. Here are some of her favorite kitchen layout ideas.Photograph by Nicole FranzenRoom With a ViewWhen laying out your kitchen, Roberts advises, \u201calways think about what you want to be looking at.\u201d A sink by the window, for instance, makes washing dishes a scenic experience, whereas a sink on an island allows for interactions with family or guests. Knowing your priorities will determine the placement of key stations.Photograph by Dustin AkslandThe Cabinet Conundrum:\u201cThere is always the question of how many upper cabinets to have and where,\u201d Roberts notes, adding that many clients now want to stare at something other than a cupboard when cooking. A single open shelf provides an elegant display for everyday staples while leaving wall space for artwork or sconces.What\u2019s Center Stage?\u201cIslands are getting boring,\u201d Roberts says. Rather than matching the cabinetry, she mixes it up with designs sheathed entirely in stone, like the marble one at fashion designer Ulla Johnson\u2019s Brooklyn brownstone. (\u201cI like a big block of something,\u201d Roberts notes.) Other islands have been detailed to look like furniture, with meticulous joinery in the woodwork. For a kitchen on the North Fork of Long Island, she added eight inches to the legs of a vintage farm table to make it counter height.Photograph by Dustin Aksland\u00a0Pulling Back the HoodAmong the first kitchen questions to ask is: How important is ventilation? (\u201cSome people like the smell of bacon,\u201d Roberts says.) Against a wall rather than above an island is typically the best place for a powerful range hood, \u201cwhich can be big and bulky.\u201d For a more minimalist look, consider concealing the air duct inside a cabinet or using a pop-out vent, like the Miele appliance at this New York City townhouse.Get Creative:For extra character, outfit your kitchen with the same decorative layers as any other room in the house. Here are four ways to do it:Courtesy of RH\u00a0Fulcrum Table Lamp by RH\u201cGo with a light fixture that is unexpected, like a task lamp on the counter or a swing-arm lamp,\u201d says Roberts.\u00a0\n$3,595 at RHCourtesy of NanzN\u00ba 6828P Cabinet PullBe playful with cabinet pulls.
