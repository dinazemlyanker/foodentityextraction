The result: We took the ingredients you might often find in bulgogi marinade and used them to create a spicy, sweet, and sour combination that takes this sandwich right to the edge.IngredientsMakes 82Tbsp. vegetable oil, divided, plus more for pan2large eggs\u00bdmedium apple, scrubbed, cored, finely grated (discard any ungrated peel)6scallions, thinly sliced4garlic cloves, finely chopped12\u201d piece ginger, peeled, thinly sliced, then finely chopped2Tbsp. gochugaru (coarse Korean red pepper powder) or other mild red pepper flakes or 2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes1Tbsp. dark or light brown sugar1Tbsp. soy sauce2tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1\u00bc tsp. Morton kosher salt1tsp. toasted sesame oil2cups panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)2lb. ground beef chuck (preferably 20% fat)16thick slices Pullman or other sandwich breadGochujang (Korean hot pepper paste), ssamjang, or ketchup and kimchi or any kind of pickles (for serving)PreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 325\u00b0. Line a 9x5\u201d loaf pan with a double layer of foil, leaving at least 3\u201d overhang on the long sides, and lightly coat with vegetable oil. Whisk eggs, apple, scallions, garlic, ginger, gochugaru, brown sugar, soy sauce, salt, and sesame oil in a large bowl to combine. Add panko and mix with a stiff rubber spatula until well combined. Let mixture sit 5 minutes to hydrate.Step 2Stir one-quarter of beef into panko mixture, smashing and folding to combine evenly. Stirring with rubber spatula or using your hands, mix in remaining beef until evenly combined. Transfer to prepared pan and press evenly into pan, working into corners.Step 3Bake meatloaf until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 160\u00b0, 1\u00bc\u20131\u00bd hours. Let cool in pan at least 20 minutesStep 4Using foil overhang, remove meatloaf from pan and transfer to a cutting board. Cut meatloaf into 8 thick slices. Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Working in batches and adding remaining 1 Tbsp. oil halfway through, cook slices, reducing heat if browning too quickly, until deeply browned and warmed through, about 4 minutes per side.Step 5Spread gochujang over one side of bread slices and top 8 slices with meatloaf and some kimchi; close up sandwiches.Step 6Do ahead: Meatloaf can be baked 4 days head. Let cool; cover and chill.How would you rate Bulgogi Meatloaf Sandwich?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (23)Back to TopTriangleAbsolutely delicious sandwich. I've made it now like 5 or 6 times and we love it so much every time. The flavors are delicious, there's a bit of prep but nothing outrageous. Just really delicious and creative. OliviaNew York, NY10/30/2021This is a very good meatloaf that I plan on making part of my regular rotation. I mixed a too-sweet gochujang I had with some mayonnaise for the spread and used homemade Salvadoran curtido for the pickles, and the sandwiches were perfect. The only adjustments I\u2019d make are to bump up the salt a bit, maybe by 50%, and microplane the ginger so its woody texture doesn\u2019t stand out so strongly. AnonymousKansas City7/20/2021sounds great! why can't I print it??\nLisa kOyster Bay, NY7/6/2021I made the meatloaf exactly as written and served it up with kimchi and a few other banchan.   The meatloaf is delicious.  It will make great sandwiches if it lasts long enough to go that route!NaomiKansas City, MO5/5/2021made this recipe exactly as is & it turned out amazingly! super flavourful & super easy! JonathanAntwerp, Belgium2/20/2021Chris, you are a genius! Your recipes never disappoint and frankly you are my Favorite (sorry BA!!!!) your creativity & play with flavors are just astounding and above all: your recipes are Always so freakin\u2019 good. Thank You Again for another awesome recipe that will be on my rotation.AnonymousNYC9/27/2020Meatloaf is a rare favorite for me so I was really excited to try this. I only used 1 1/2 lbs of meat and filled the rest in with shittake mushrooms. It smells and tastes AMAZING, topped with kimchi, American cheese, and avocado. Will definitely be adding sesame seeds next time. AnonymousPittsburgh, PA9/13/2020I hated meatloaf until I made this meatloaf!  I made this almost two weeks ago and am still eating it.  Two pounds of meat is a lot for one person.  It's so tasty I didn't want to freeze half of it.  I've eaten it cold in a sandwich, warm in a sandwich, fried with a side of Hawai'ian mac, and crumbled and stuffed into onigiri.\n\nThe only variation I made to the original recipe is I mixed gochujang into mayo and used that on the sandwiches instead of just gochujang.  The sandwiches are really filling - too much so for me.  After the first one I was more careful about the using less bread and thinner slices.  It's a pretty messy sandwich so making it into a wrap or using pocket bread would be a great idea, I think.tammykirk302Monterey5/29/2020I made just the meatloaf, and it was divine! I added a glaze of 1tbsp gochujang and 1.5 tbsp ketchup before baking and it added that sweet-spicy touch that I enjoy on top of a meatloaf. I served it with a spicy cucumber salad, kimchi and some quick stir-fried veggies. A perfect mash-up of Bulgogi and Americana. Sugar_PiesKnoxville5/23/2020I made this dish for dinner and skipped the bread. It was delicious! I added a layer of gochujang to the meatloaf about 15 minutes into it baking and it was delicious. Definitely recommend!PBJamrogColumbus5/21/2020This sandwich is an experience. Super easy to make. Will definitely make again. I added mayo to the gochujang because I'm trashy and I used milk bread because it was the only bread I had in the house. Amazing.CollegeCookingDetroit5/21/2020Took forever and a day to cook, but worth it! Very flavorful and delicious!AnonymousSeattle5/19/2020So so yummy. It took longer than I thought it would to prep, bake and serve (2.5 hours) but is totally worth it! Haven't eaten meatloaf since I was a kid but this is amazing.AnonymousBrooklyn, NY5/18/2020What is the layer on top of the meatloaf in the photo?\nchef-dadCarlsbad,CA5/17/2020Easy and delicious!!
