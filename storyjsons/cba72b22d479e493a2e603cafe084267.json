He shares recipes he\u2019s been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you\u2019ll get this letter before everyone else.Come over!7pmishSteak and baked potatoes\u2014super simpleAnd martinisThat was the extent of the text, and it was all I needed to hear.It came from our friends Torrey and Steven, who have a yen for impromptu dinner invites. They hit up my wife and me on Saturday afternoon and we were immediately all in.Michael Graydon + Nikole HerriottThe old-school simplicity of the menu spoke to me. Why make things more complicated than they need to be? But in terms of specifics, what really pulled me in wasn\u2019t the martinis. I\u2019m way too much of a lightweight to handle straight vodka and vermouth (yes, I know \u201creal\u201d martinis are made with gin). And while I love steak, I eat a lot of it.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!It was the baked potato that got me. I can\u2019t recall the last time I baked one, and yet every time I\u2019m served one, I ask myself why I don\u2019t eat them more often.Torrey and Steven did like Andrew Knowlton preached a few years back. Rub up a russet with a generous amount of olive oil, hit it with some sea salt, and then pop it in a 400 degree oven, right on the rack.Michael Graydon + Nikole HerriottAn hour later, it emerges all browned and glistening and crispy, reminding you that the skin can be the best part, if you treat it right. (Read: Do not wrap your potato in foil, unless you appreciate limp, papery skin.)At the table, I prefer to split mine lengthwise like a pocketbook, pinch in the ends to open it up, and then add several pats of butter. And some salt. If there is sour cream on the table, I will not say no. Scallions for a bit of bite, absolutely. But even better, chives\u2014for that allium flavor without being too aggressive.Grated cheese I can do without. Same with bacon, unless the stuffed potato is the meal unto itself. But if there is a beautifully grilled porterhouse on the table, like there was Saturday night, I\u2019d prefer not to insult the steak.And I\u2019m not ashamed to admit that about half way through my baked potato, I will re-up on the butter and salt and sour cream and chives. Because who knows when I\u2019ll have one again.Get the recipe:Perfect Baked PotatoCrisp on the outside, pillowy on the inside, and up for dancing with any savory flavor in your fridge or pantry.\u00a0View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterPotatoRead MorecookingMake French Toast On a WeekdayBy Adam RapoportcultureBon Appe\u0301tit Used to Just Be a Magazine.
