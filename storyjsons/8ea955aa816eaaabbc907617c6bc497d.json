But this year, Le Creuset is giving everyone (taken or otherwise) another reason to stay home with their new heart-shaped cookware.The company, known for unbeatable enameled dutch ovens, recently launched red and pink-colored ramekins, cast iron cocottes, and even a small fondue set for the most classic Valentine's Day meal. The heartwarming collection will run you $30 for the ramekins, $50 for the fondue set, and $150 to $200 for the cocotte, but who can put a price on love?Lately, Le Creuset has been hard at work, churning out new color-schemes and shapes to keep up with every trend imaginable. Last year, there was the introduction of millennial pink, also known as \"Sugar Pink Matte,\" items, which seem to have found new life in the Valentine's Day collection. There was also a Snow White-themed collaboration with Disney and, most recently, a \"Provence\" lilac color, inspired by the lavender fields of Southern France\u2014and perhaps, 2018's Pantone Color of the Year.As for your Valentine's Day menu, those ramekins are just begging to be filled with chocolate souffl\u00e9 (it's easier to make than you think). Throw some bourbon and beer in with your cheese fondue, and the meal will taste just as on point as the presentation looks. The only downside: Irregularly-shaped dishes still need to be cleaned.
