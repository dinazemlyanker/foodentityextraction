In college, I would scour best beef jerky dot org (a real and amazing website) in search of the best regional jerky from places like Florida and Arizona. These days, if you\u2019re looking for me at a party, you\u2019ll probably find me near the charcuterie board, eating all the salami. My devotion runs deep. Which is why I am pleased to report that I have a new inductee to my Salty Meat Snack Hall of Fame: Olympia Provisions\u2019 Pepperettes.They\u2019re like Slim Jims\u2014you know, that mystery meat stick you always spot near the cash register at the gas station\u2014but the ingredient list doesn\u2019t read like a scary science experiment. Instead, these pepperettes are made of just pork, pork fat, sodium nitrite (a necessary and common preservative in cured meats), potassium sorbate (another natural preservative), dextrose (a.k.a. sugar, which helps with fermenting sausages), lamb casing (this gives the pepperettes their signature snap), and spices\u2014depending on the flavor you get.There\u2019s the sophisticated Petite Pierre, which has juniper, white pepper, and red wine. Kleine Schweine gets its kick from caraway, coriander, and chile flakes. The most aggressive of the bunch, Flaco Paco, packs heat with paprika, oregano, and garlic. You see those real ingredients, Mr. Jim? Plus, the pepperettes don\u2019t require any refrigeration, making them ideal for road trips or to keep in your purse for Hanger Prevention.Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to get back to presenting my Very Official salty meat snack trophy\u2014it\u2019s shaped like a sausage, thanks for asking\u2014to Olympia Provisions\u2019 Pepperettes.Buy it: Olympia Provisions Pepperette Sample Pack, $32All products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
