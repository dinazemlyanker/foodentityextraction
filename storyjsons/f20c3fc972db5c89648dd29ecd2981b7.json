Sign up for our newsletter!It all started a few weeks back, while I was cooking dinner out by the beach. I got in my head that I wanted to make Andrew Knowlton\u2019s grilled chicken wings with shishito peppers. Except, instead of wings, I asked my guy at 8 Hands Farm to take a whole chicken and cut it into parts. See, the recipe is flexible that way. And, well, it\u2019s kind of genius. You throw together a simple, Asian-inspired marinade, and you reserve half of it, so when the chicken comes off the grill\u2014all deep brown and glistening\u2014you bathe it with the remaining marinade, which sings of sesame oil, soy and shallots.My only question was\u2014and here\u2019s where I got into it with Claire and Christina\u2014was how do you get the chicken all crispy and golden brown without blackening the skin and undercooking the meat?Chimichurri sauce makes grilled chicken taste even better.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca JurkevichClaire, while pitching a spatchcocked chicken recipe to me, is of the school that you start the chicken skin side down. \u201cI go skin-side down over medium heat first to char the skin and start to render the fat, then I flip and cook the chicken through over indirect. The skin keeps rendering and bastes the meat as it cooks.\u201dSure, fair enough. But isn\u2019t she worried about burning the skin when the fat drips into the fire, spurring flare-ups?I was! So I banked my coals to one side of my Weber (if I was using a gas grill, I would\u2019ve lit two of the four burners), and I placed the marinated chicken parts bone-side down over indirect heat, and I put the cover on, top and bottom vents open, creating my own little outdoor oven.This allowed the skin to slowly render, without risk of burning, and the meat to the cook through. After about 15 minutes, I took a peek and, man, was it gorgeous\u2014like mini pieces of Peking duck, all tawny and smoky brown.I then flipped the parts and inched them closer to the glowing orange coals, top removed, in order to bring the skin to its desired crispy state. Of course, being starving and the sun having long since gone down, I pushed a few pieces a bit too directly over the coals and those parts did get all blackened. But the other pieces\u2014perfection.Now, as far technique goes, I\u2019m not saying that Claire is wrong, but I am saying that I\u2019m right.Miss Ollie\u2019s jerk chicken is on my to-cook list this summer.\nAlex LauAnd I\u2019m going to put my scientifically tested method to work now through Labor Day, grilling up Molly Baz\u2019s tandoori chicken wings. And Alison Roman\u2019s classic barbecued chicken. And I\u2019ll give Miss Ollie\u2019s jerk chicken a shot, even though I\u2019ll be relying on plain-old charcoal instead of the fragrant pimento wood they\u2019ve got down in Jamaica.And, oh yeah, back to Knowlton\u2019s chicken. I plated the pieces, and poured the intoxicating marinade all over them, the hot chicken soaking up its flavors. My friend Roo even insisted that the two blackened pieces were his favorite. It\u2019s nice to have nice friends.Get the recipes:Grilled Chicken Wings with Shishito PeppersChimichurri SauceButterflied Chicken with Herbs and Cracked OlivesGrilled Chicken with Board DressingTandoori Chicken WingsBarbecued ChickenMiss Ollie\u2019s Jerk ChickenExplore Bon App\u00e9titChickenGrill BarbecueAdam NewsletterRecipes you want to make.
