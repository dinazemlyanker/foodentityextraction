You just keep adding fat until the beans are thick enough to stand up on a plate, which is very common as part of a Salvadoran breakfast, with tortillas, eggs, fried plantains, avocado, and queso. They\u2019re often made with lard, but I make mine with olive oil. It\u2019s a little healthier, plus I\u2019m cooking in California, so I try to be respectful of vegetarians who come in.\u201d Serve these very rich beans in modest dollops with sour cream and avocado for scooping up with thick Salvadoran-style corn tortillas.IngredientsMakes about 4 cups16garlic cloves, smashed315-oz. cans black beans, rinsed\u00bccup lard, duck fat, schmaltz, or extra-virgin olive oil1jalape\u00f1o, split lengthwiseKosher salt1cup extra-virgin olive oil, dividedSour cream, sliced avocado, and warmed corn tortillas (for serving)PreparationStep 1Pulse garlic in a food processor until very finely chopped. Scrape into a small bowl. Pulse beans and 3 Tbsp. water in processor (no need to clean) until a coarse paste forms, about 2 minutes.Step 2Heat lard in a large nonstick skillet over medium. Cook garlic, stirring constantly, until lightly golden around the edges, about 3 minutes. Immediately add beans, jalape\u00f1o, and a big pinch of salt and cook, stirring and folding in beans with a heatproof rubber spatula, until incorporated and beans turn a shade darker, about 10 minutes.Step 3Reduce heat to medium-low, add \u00bc cup oil and cook, stirring often, until oil is absorbed and beans start to dry out at edges, about 5 minutes or so. Continue to cook, adding remaining oil by \u00bc-cupfuls every 5 minutes and stirring occasionally, until very thick and dark, 15\u201320 minutes. Discard jalape\u00f1o. Season with more salt if needed. Serve with sour cream, avocado, and tortillas.How would you rate Super-Refried Beans?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (4)Back to TopTriangleAbsolutely delicious! I didn't use about a 1/4 cup of the olive oil. Next time I might use even less since it's maybe a bit too rich for a weekday meal. AnonymousBrooklyn, NY9/6/2021In El Salvador, we use red kidney beans, not the black beans the recipe calls for. Most cooks add green bell pepper, instead of a jalape\u00f1o, and a pinch of cumin. If using olive oil instead of lard, we add an equal amount of butter, for added flavor.AnonymousEl Salvador10/10/2020This is a simple but delicious treat for breakfast!AnonymousLondon10/6/2020Got the magazine yesterday, saw this, made it today. It's wonderful! I'm really happy and vampire-proof. \nFriends, splurge on the good olive oil. Always, but especially here. jonkmartin703587Indianapolis,IN9/26/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSalvadoranCentral AmericanLatin AmericanBlack BeanBeanVegetableEasySideGluten-FreeVegetarianNut-FreeDinnerRecipes you want to make.
