Which is silly, because the whole thing should have been pretty straightforward. All I wanted to do is tell the world about The Kermit Chair, the handsomest, sturdiest, and most kick-back-and-relax comfortable folding chair I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of landing my tush upon. Grunting out 300 or so words about a product I have strong opinions about? Easy! That\u2019s. What. I. DO.And yet, for whatever reason, I couldn\u2019t make it happen. I knew what I wanted to say of course. That The Kermit Chair\u2014a cult-classic named not for the muppet, but for the BMW motorcycle enthusiast who designed it in the mid-80s to be the ultimate pack-along camping seat\u2014was impossibly classique looking, all Tennessean White Oak, stainless steel, and richly dyed weatherproof nylon. That it was ergonomically superior to any other folding chair I had sat in before, low enough to the ground to keep me in a supremely comfortable squat, pitched back ever so slightly, with a curved stave of wood offering back support just where I needed it most.I knew I wanted to say something about how, while most folding chairs were too damn upright and made me feel like a soccer dad ready to leap up and choke a volunteer referee, or waaaaay too reclined in that scary Crap, I literally can\u2019t get up kind of way, The Kermit Chair put me exactly where I wanted to be: laid back just enough (both physically and spiritually) as to be relaxed without feeling beached. And I was for sure going to say something about the fact that, through some feat of design, it folds up into the tidiest little burrito of a package, eminently discreet and portable.But I just couldn\u2019t make it happen. Sitting in my slick, over-designed, graphite and mesh desk chair high up in a corporate skyscraper, I just couldn\u2019t get the words to flow. So I went down to the photo studio where they had just finished shooting The Kermit Chair for this story, carried it to a quiet corner of the office, and settled right down into it. I opened my laptop, cracked my knuckles, and got ready to write.And then I promptly fell asleep.Buy It: The Kermit Chair, $189 from kermitchair.comAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
