It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Signs and symbolsThis week my partner shook a cocktail so vigorously the lid of the shaker froze onto the base and we couldn\u2019t get it off. It felt like a metaphor for the week. Nothing will be easy for you! The stuck-on shaker cackled. We smacked it against the sink \u2018til it opened. The next day, our car was packed and we drove 14 hours to Michigan to self-quarantine for two weeks before we stay with family enduring an entirely different health catastrophe: relentless cancer. (The oncologist approved this plan.) It\u2019s snowy here, and the only vegetable in the fridge is a head of cabbage. I brought pasta, tomato paste, shallots, and heavy cream so we can make our favorite comfort food, Jon & Vinny\u2019s vodka sauce, on repeat.Get the recipe: Fusilli alla Vodka with Basil and ParmesanWant this letter before it hits the website?

Weeeeeee!!!Read more: I Gave In And Tried the Frothy Coffee ThingThe closest we\u2019ll get to going back to the officeThanks to the redditor who made this Test Kitchen virtual background for Zoom! Complete with Sohla El-Waylly at Station 2 in case you need culinary support.6 thingsI observed in the Test Kitchen\u2019s pantry pasta video.Andy: casually has a Meyer lemonBrad: has a Le Creuset in petit fruits, my favorite pattern tooClaire: what are those rustic red pepper flakes? (They\u2019re Tutto, of course.)Sohla: has the best induction burner out there, the Breville Control Freak, because her electric stove doesn\u2019t get hot enough to sear.Chris: \u2019s kids have enough combined teeth to be extras on Tiger KingAmiel: has a Dutch oven salvaged from the trenches of World War INot all substitutionsGoogle doesn\u2019t have all the answers. When it comes to food substitutions, I go to The Food Substitutions Bible, an encyclopedia of exactly what it sounds like. But in the way the dictionary leads you from one word to four, a recent journey led me to substituting mayo in place of buttermilk in banana bread. It was only \u2153 of a cup, no big deal, right? And Chris Morocco\u2019s beloved mayo chocolate cake uses it! Well, my banana bread came out bouncy and sticky, like those rubber hands you fling against the wall until they get so covered with carpet fuzz you lose interest. Better luck next time.So much for the pouchesEarlier this year I wrote about the rise in snack foods that seemed marketed at survivalists, who turn out to be desk-glued, overworked office mice. Pouches of energy-boosting chia, dehydrated cheese cubes for grounded astronauts, and an ever-loosening definition of jerky. Looking back at the story now, my timing was...prescient. But now that we\u2019re living it, this plotline torn from a sci-fi novel I\u2019d pass up on the library shelf, no one is thrilled to share their meal of room temp oatmeal in a pouch. People seem to be cooking real food (frozen pizza counts). So that\u2019s a relief.Easter happened\u201cHappy Easter,\u201d I said, sliding three cups of Royal instant pistachio pudding\u2014nuclear mint green, specked with almonds doing their best impersonation of pricey pistachios\u2014to my family. It tasted like melted spumoni ice cream and by that I mean: it was delicious. This is pudding propaganda and nothing more.For some sad reason we only have 11 pudding recipes???Unnecessary TikTok of the weekOther than this masterpiece that features Hooters hoverboard curbside pickup, I came across MANY Bon App\u00e9tit TikToks this week and it\u2019s hard to pick my favorite. It\u2019s a tossup between this one and this one.Unnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the week\u201cI have a question,\u201d Emily Schultz posed to our staff Slack room. \u201cI\u2019ve been seeing so many people roast a chicken upside down\u2026but like who said the breast up way is right?! What\u2019s the difference?\u201d It seemed like a fitting method for upside-down times. \u201cGuys, I have done it upside down many times,\u201d replied Julia Kramer. \u201cAnd a turkey, too.\u201d \u201cOn purpose??\u201d asked Molly Baz. \u201cIt really depends on how the heat in your oven circulates,\u201d said Julia, who likes this method because she doesn\u2019t care about the breast. \u201cReally you\u2019re prioritizing the thighs,\u201d she said. Molly was convinced: \u201cThe legs are the best part so why not optimize their Crispiness?\u201d \u201cExactly,\u201d said Julia. \u201cAnd then the breast is maybe more steamed,\u201d Molly continued, \u201cwhich isn\u2019t the worst, and perfect for chix salad. Wow I am shook to my core.\u201d \u201cI just worry about flabby skin once you turn it back over,\u201d said Carla Lalli Music, who only roasts in one direction (so far), \u201cbut maybe we have to invent a new way to carve a chicken \u2018from behind\u2019 and really next-level this whole thing.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like a bad idea,\u201d was Schultz\u2019s conclusion, \u201cand people should stop being so RIGID about how things are done in the kitch. I wish I had a spare chicken to roast.\u201d Same, same, same.Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecookingHow to Make Do With Some Smart SwapsBy Carla Lalli MusicLifestyleThree Things That Are HelpingBy Amanda ShapirocookingBean Broth Is My Bone BrothBy Adam RapoportcookingDon\u2019t Cry Because Basically Baking Is OverBy Sarah JampelRecipes you want to make.
