Almost all the components of these stunning enchiladas can be made ahead. Here\u2019s how to pull it off: Poach the chicken, make both sauces, and prepare the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche topping in advance.

Let chicken cool at least 1 hour (it should be just warm). If you have the time, cover and chill up to 12 hours.Step 4Remove chicken from broth.

Place in a small bowl and pour in broth to submerge; cover and chill.How would you rate Enchiladas Divorciadas?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (6)Back to TopTriangleThese were wonderful. We've made these a few times just with the salsa verde but went full tilt last night with both sauces since we just got a new Vitamix. Only changes we made were poaching the chicken in homemade chicken stock and then tossing pulled chicken with reduced poaching liquid and a little butter. The end result was phenomenal and it came together in just under 2 hours. Thank you Daniela and BA for the brilliant recipe!emilyrBoston, MA6/27/2020Yummy idea! Great recipe but followed it 3/4 of it. I made the salsa verde just like it says, used only chicken breasts used fresh Cotija cheese. For the red salsa, I used dried guajillo, ancho and de arbol chiles, boiled then pureed with onion and garlic then fried.  Much better!!! Will make again!!!AnonymousMonterrey, Mexico3/24/2020Pat, those are the colors of the Mexican flag, red, green, white\nTamales for Christmas\nlarrypsPalm Springs CA5/4/2019One of the best dishes I've cooked in a while. To save time I roasted a pounded chicken breast so it was crispy on the outside,  and U10 shrimp head on, both in a convection oven which took 14 minutes. I also made avocado sour cream for the topping instead of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche . Between the sauces, the sour cream and filling, the flavors were exploding. I made extra sauce so I was able to whip up another batch a week later in about 1/2 hour.AnonymousDedham MA3/4/2019I followed this recipe exactly, it was just so-so.  Putting the chicken inside the tortilla with nothing else made for a very plain dish.  The salsa verde was delicious.  The salsa roja was meh - looked nothing like the photo.    Next time I'll mix the chicken, creme fraiche, and queso fresco together with some of the salsa verde, then roll in the tortilla, top with more salsa verde and put into the oven to melt the cheese.  Then add the fresh onions on top before serving.  dcarsCleveland, OH2/20/2019I'd much rather these be called Christmas Enchiladas patshannon068604Denver2/2/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titMexicanLatin AmericanChickenPoultrySerrano ChileChileVegetableTomatilloQueso FrescoCheeseMainNut-FreeGluten-FreeHealthyishSimmerFryDinnerRecipes you want to make.
