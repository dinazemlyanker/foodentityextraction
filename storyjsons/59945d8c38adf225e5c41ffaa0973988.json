But even as the Philippine\u2019s fastest-growing restaurant export expands throughout the U.S., it is far from ubiquitous. \u201cSome people will drive three hours just to have a taste of it, which is wild,\u201d says Tom Cunanan, one of the two chefs behind Pogiboy in Washington, D.C. \u201cWe thought, Why not do our own version here?\u201dCunanan and co-chef Paolo Dungca\u2014they worked together at the groundbreaking restaurant Bad Saint\u2014opened Pogiboy in March. Tagalog for \u201chandsome boy,\u201d Pogiboy is a term of endearment which aunties from all walks of life generously shower upon pretty much every Filipino boy. It is also a wink to the nostalgia the team serves. Rather than focus on exclusively traditional dishes, the duo draws from their childhood memories of drive-thru hamburgers, their identities, and suburban dining.Where Bad Saint was a game-changing celebration of Filipinx fine-dining, Pogiboy is more low-key and casual. For starters, there\u2019s the splashy primary-blue-and-yellow Pogiboy logo that\u2019s a callback to suburban Maryland Bob\u2019s Big Boy, where Cunanan and his siblings regularly dined as kids, and references on the menu to Jollibee and Outback Steakhouse favorites: sinigang fried chicken, which draws flavors from a classic sour soup, and a deep-fried blooming onion served with a genius crab-fat mayo and scallion seasoning.But the main event is the To \u201cChino\u201d burger, a stacked smash burger that rethinks Filipino flavors and execution. \u201cWe can\u2019t claim this burger as our own,\u201d Cunanan says. \u201cOur friend Charles Olalia [chef of the shuttered Ma\u2019am Sir in Los Angeles] had a longanisa sandwich on his menu, and this is our homage to him\u2014we wouldn\u2019t be here without our friends and family.\u201dHere Cunanan and Dunga break down their version of the burger.The PattiesThese are a 50-50 blend of tocino, pork belly cured in annatto and garlic, and longanisa, a type of sausage found across the Philippines. Smashing the patties enhances the slightly sweet flavor both meats are prized for\u2014something Cunanan learned as a burger joint line cook in his 20s.The BunCunanan and Dungca couldn\u2019t do brioche (too sweet for the patties) or typically soft potato buns (too gummy after soaking up the patty juices). Their business partner, Arturo Mei, recommended the sturdy, savory potato buns from Ottenberg\u2019s Bakers in Baltimore. Just right.The Pineapple\u201cIn my experience, if you\u2019re a Pacific Islander, say from Guam, the Philippines, or Hawaii, you always want pork with pineapple,\u201d Cunanan says. Sliced thinner than the canned stuff and quickly charred on the grill, fresh pineapple rings \u201cadd acid and texture, plus a caramelly note.\u201dThe PickleEvery burger needs a pickle. Enter the house atchara, a Filipino green papaya pickled with Datu Puti sugarcane vinegar, that\u2019s bolstered with carrots and onions. \u201cVinegar is almost sacred to Filipinos,\u201d Dungca says. \u201cIt\u2019s served in some form with every meal.\u201dThe Secret SauceJufran banana ketchup, another Filipino kitchen staple, is blended with Duke\u2019s mayo, gochugaru, cornichons, house-made chile vinegar, and Maggi Magic Sarap seasoning. \u201cIt\u2019s Filipino Thousand Island,\u201d Cunanan says. \u201cWhen they eat this I want Filipino customers to be smacked in the face with nostalgia.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsDish DecodedRecipes you want to make.
