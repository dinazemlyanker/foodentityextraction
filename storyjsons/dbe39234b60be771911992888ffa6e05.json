But when a platter of slow-roasted lamb neck shawarma makes its way from the kitchen\u2019s wood-burning fire through the cavernous dining room, all eyes turn to the meat. You can\u2019t blame them: The imposing on-the-bone cut isn\u2019t as common as, say, lamb chops. And that\u2019s exactly why they chose to include it on the menu here, and at their Italian hot spot Bestia too.\u201cOur philosophy at both restaurants is utilizing all parts of the animal,\" Menashe says. \u201cThis is one of the parts that the butcher is always stuck with, because nobody wants to deal with the neck. We figure out ways to showcase how good it can be.\u201dThe layers of flavor begin with a carefully balanced blend of spices\u2014cardamom, allspice, black pepper, sumac\u2014mixed with an onion pur\u00e9e that caramelizes as the lamb slow-roasts for 12 to 16 hours. Then the meat is finished in a wood-burning oven and served up tableside with a fleet of spicy, pickle-y condiments and a fluffy mound of hot laffa flatbread. The presentation makes one thing clear: This is not a meal for forks and knives. It\u2019s a total hands-on affair, with the laffa as the best tool for nudging the smoky, tender meat off the vertebrae straight into your mouth. Add tahini, crunchy pickles, and fiery amba sauce at will, then use whatever is left of the bread to soak up every last puddle of lamb juices. This is a dish worth savoring until the very end.Go There: BavelExplore Bon App\u00e9titLos AngelesMiddle EasternHighly RecommendRestaurantsLambRead MorerestaurantsHow a Cheap, Bent-Up Composition Notebook Helped Me Open a RestaurantBy Ori MenasheRecipes you want to make.
