Inspired by the technique called escab\u00e8che, where cooked fish and meat are preserved in an acidic mixture, we're cooking first, marinating second\u2014in this case, in a coriander-spiked vinaigrette. Don't be intimidated by the slices of jalape\u00f1os: The fire of the grill mellows their heat. If you're a real spice-seeker, you can even leave some of them raw.Ingredients4 servings\u00bdcup plus 3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more for grill4bone-in pork rib chops (about 10 oz. each)Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper2tsp. coriander seeds\u00bccup apple cider vinegar1tsp. sugar2large jalape\u00f1os\u00bcmedium white onion, very thinly slicedPreparationStep 1Prepare a grill for medium-high heat; lightly oil grate. Pat pork chops dry and season generously all over with salt and pepper. Place on a rimmed baking sheet and let sit at room temperature at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.Step 2Meanwhile, toast coriander seeds in a dry small skillet over medium heat, tossing often, until golden brown and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Transfer seeds to a cutting board and let cool. Using a flat-bottomed mug or a heavy skillet, lightly crush. Place in a small bowl and add vinegar, sugar, and \u00bd cup oil. Season with salt and pepper and whisk until sugar and salt are dissolved. Set marinade aside.Step 3Toss jalape\u00f1os and 1 Tbsp. oil in a small bowl to coat; season with salt and pepper. Pat pork chops dry again (the salt will have drawn out more moisture) and rub with remaining 2 Tbsp. oil. Grill jalape\u00f1os, turning often, until softened and blackened in spots, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board. Grill pork chops, turning every 2 minutes or so, until cooked through but still medium-rare closest to the bone (an instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should register 145\u00b0), 8\u201312 minutes. Transfer to cutting board and let rest 10\u201315 minutes.Step 4Cut pork along the bone to remove meat in one piece; slice \u00bd\" thick and transfer to a rimmed platter. Slice jalape\u00f1os crosswise into rounds and scatter over pork. Pour reserved marinade over and let sit at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour before serving. To serve, scatter onion over.How would you rate Jalape\u00f1o-Marinated Grilled Pork Chops?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (10)Back to TopTriangleThis was a hit, my parents both had 2nd helpings!  I followed reviewer's menu of couscous and simple salad with lime vinaigrette and it was just great.  JRSan Diego12/15/2021Someone wrote that this was one of the best things he/she made at home, and I 100% agree! This one\u2019s a keeper. For three chops, I kept all other ingredients the same, with the exception of using a tablespoon of coriander seeds and another jalapeno.Julia4/10/2021one of the best things i've ever made at home! Anonymousnew york, ny7/5/2020really great recipe! seared and roasted the pork as we don't have a grill & it still came out fine. served with cous cous and served w a simple salad dressed in dijon and lime. absolutely delightful & would even work if made a day ahead of time. I'd definitely suggest upping the coriander seeds as the flavour is quite delicatesaccharine serfWhittlesey9/11/2019The article that this recipe came from was my favorite for A Summer 2019.  It changed my way of marinating.  It made me a believer in marinating after cooking vs. prior to cooking.  This prom recipe not only tastes great but is nice and moist.AnonymousNew Jersey8/18/2019I would try a different marinade - the coriander was too mild (might have been old)... maybe oregano; seemed like a lot of oil when serving/ eating.\n\nJalape\u00f1os were good (I removed seeds after grilling)...  used thin sliced red onion - lots is good!\n\nChops were good but get boneless pork next time...  good method - might work well for beef steak with a red wine marinade.zipsterCanada7/17/2019Really really delicious. A little fiery with the jalape\u00f1o seeds, but not in a bad way.  Added a little more acv, and couldn\u2019t find coriander seeds so I just used ground and it was still amazing. Will def make again! hinagartenNYC 7/5/2019This was a very good, simple pork dish with lots of flavor.  We served with the marinated squash/zucchini with feta (from the same June/July issue) and the veggies out shined the pork, however.  I would possibly cut back on the amount of oil next time, as the pork didn't really soak it up and it there was a lot left on the platter.  No leftovers with this meal - it all got eaten in one sitting!AnonymousTexas7/1/2019Loved it!AnonymousSan Diego 6/25/2019Really great dish. Wife LOVED it.
