See our past recommendations here!I hardly recognize seltzer anymore. Starting with LaCroix, seltzer took down her ponytail, swapped her glasses for contacts, and went to prom with Freddie Prinze Jr. Now seltzer is fancied up with a spritz of calamansi juice or caffeinated or combined with malt liquor and consumed in excessive quantities poolside. I don\u2019t mind; I liked her when she was just carbonated water, but I\u2019m happy to see she\u2019s thriving.Of the many new flavored seltzer water brands to hit the market recently, Something & Nothing is among my favorites. The British company just launched online and in stores in select U.S. cities with three flavors\u2014yuzu, hibiscus and rose, and cucumber. All contain no added sugar, relying instead on grape juice to lend a baseline hint of sweetness. They\u2019re more flavorful than a Spindrift, less than an Orangina\u2014to me, something like a cross between a soda and a seltzer. A soltzer?At 41 to 57 calories per can, they\u2019re not the kind of bubbly beverage I want to mindlessly pound throughout the work day. (I\u2019ll save that for White Claw!) But if I need an afternoon pick-me-up, I\u2019ll open a can of the floral, lemonade-y yuzu. Come happy hour, I\u2019ll mix the cucumber flavor with gin for a tonic alternative that still brings some sweetness. My heart will always belong to plain old seltzer, but there\u2019s room for Something & Nothing too.Yuzu Seltzer, 12-pack$35 at Something & NothingExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish Loves ItShoppingSeltzerAlcohol & Other DrinksRead MoreLifestyleThis Eye Massager Is So Relaxing, I Fall Asleep With It OnBy Elyse InamineRecipes you want to make.
