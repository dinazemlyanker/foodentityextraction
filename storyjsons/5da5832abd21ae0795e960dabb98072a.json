(Looking at you, avocados.) But plantains, which are related to bananas but much more versatile, are an exception: They\u2019re tasty from when they\u2019re picked (rock-hard and green as grass) until they reach peak ripeness\u2014you\u2019ve just got to know how to use them at each stage.Let\u2019s start with unripe plantains, which have rigid green skins. (The skin of a green plantain is so tough that it\u2019s not easy to peel. You\u2019ll need to score the plantain along its ribs, then pull of the skin strip by strip.) The interior is firm, starchy, and not at all sweet\u2014more similar to that of a raw potato than a banana.Fry thin slices of green plantains to make plantain chips, or cut thicker circles or ovals for tostones, the crispy, twice-fried snack eaten across Latin America and the Caribbean. Smash fried green plantains with garlic, olive oil, and fried pork skin for mofongo, a beloved dish in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba. Green plantains can also be grated and turned into fritters, braised in broth, or cut into pieces and added to soup, which they\u2019ll thicken with their natural starches.Green plantains are destined for tostones.\u00a0\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Yekaterina Boytsova\u00a0As plantains ripen, they turn yellow, then develop some brown spots, and eventually (really, this can take weeks) reach peak ripeness, at which point they\u2019re very dark brown, nearly black. The change in color indicates that the starches on the inside are converting into sugars and the flavor is getting progressively sweeter, though still earthy and vegetal. Their insides soften, veering into sticky and even syrupy territory, and the skin thins, making the peeling process slightly easier.Caramelize ripe plantains to make maduros.\u00a0\nPhoto by Laura Murray, food styling by Judy Mancini.When a plantain is anywhere from decidedly yellow to deeply black, you can still deep-fry or pan-fry them, but what you\u2019ll get is something entirely different: maduros (which translates to \u201cmature\u201d or \u201cripe\u201d in Spanish). Because their sugar content has increased, the plantains will have caramelized edges and pudding-soft insides. Ripe plantains can be simmered or roasted, then mashed, or sliced and grilled, or roasted whole, then split open and topped with butter and herbs or brown sugar.Now that\u2019s one fruit with so much to give!Start with tostones:Tostones With Creamy Green SauceThe double-fried, extra-crispy plantains will never be as good as they are immediately after coming out of the hot oil, but you can hold them in a warm oven if absolutely necessary.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPlantainRecipes you want to make.
