Despite what my friends think, I\u2019m actually working on a pretty tight schedule, traveling from restaurant to restaurant and shooting for eight hours straight to get all that nice natural light before the sun sets. That means my meals usually consist of nibbling on food we just shot or eating garbage food from wherever can get it fastest. Cue world\u2019s tiniest violin!That said, these trips have led to some pretty amazing discoveries: like the time last year when I found the candy that changed it all for me. We had just wrapped at Che Fico in San Francisco, No. 7 on 2018\u2019s Hot 10 list, and I did my usual thing before the next shoot: I stopped into a nearby corner store to buy a Diet Coke and a snack. And there they were: Haribo Happy Cola Lemon Fresh Gummies.I love gummy candies. They\u2019re my favorite naughty, sugary snacks, which is helpful when you\u2019re working long days. I also love a Diet Coke. But cola gummies? I\u2019ve usually felt pretty ambivalent about them. They\u2019re often too sweet, and just a one-note flavor. But lemon in a cola gummy? I thought I\u2019d give it a try.Thank goodness I did! These are the best cola gummies I\u2019ve ever had. They taste exactly like a Diet Coke with a little lemon wedge in it. That citrusy flavor makes it feel refreshing and just delightful. Our staff photographer Alex Lau and I couldn\u2019t get enough of them. As we continued to travel for the Hot 10 shoots, we kept looking for these lemon colas but couldn\u2019t find them anywhere. That is, until Alex bought some on Amazon and sent me them as a surprise. Now I have three bags of the gummies, which I have to hide inside my desk so I don\u2019t finish them before my next work trip. On the road, they\u2019re exactly the right thing when you need a dose of sugar\u2014oh, and joy.Buy it: Haribo Happy Cola Lemon Fresh Gummy, $6 on amazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
