Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,Hi from Austin, where I am here waiting in lines! Everyone says SXSW is the worst time to come to Austin, and I believe it, but even as one of 80,000 interlopers, I\u2019m having a great time. Yesterday afternoon, I talked about why we\u2019re so obsessed with wellness alongside Kirby Bumpus of Sweetgreen and Mo Clancy of Five Suns Foods. Then Bon App\u00e9tit hosted a pizza party at The Carpenter Hotel, where no one was obsessed with wellness (though the pizza was vegetarian...and very good).What I\u2019m EatingI\u2019ve been in Austin for 48 hours and I haven\u2019t eaten a taco yet. This is a huge problem that I will remedy by adding \u201ctaco break\u201d into my SXSW calendar. [Update: I\u2019ve eaten two tacos since writing this draft.] Instead I\u2019ve eaten a chopped salad at Carpenters Hall, the aforementioned pizza, a nice plate of cauliflower at Cafe No S\u00e9, and various snacks and bars while waiting in lines. The best bar? Big Spoon Roasters\u2019 cherry pecan, by a mile. It\u2019s all about that salty-sweet.New! Healthyish! Recipes!Did you think kale chips were over? I have news for you: They still got it. Also: BREAKFAST BLONDIES. And while I have your attention, can we talk about steaming some more? Sweet potatoes aside, it\u2019s also my favorite way to cook non-smelly, never-dry, done-in-ten-minutes fish, and Christina Chaey\u2019s new recipe is so simple and good; you don\u2019t even need a steamer basket.Kale chips are back.\nIn Other Healthyish NewsRachel Sugar intrepidly spends the day at a wellness coworking space trying to figure out what \u201cwellness coworking\u201d even means. \u201cDoes your office need a gong room?\u201d she asks, and I\u2019ve been asking myself the same question ever since. Yoga teacher, podcaster, and writer Kathryn Budig is sick of people commenting about what she eats. Deanna Pai dives into the facial massage technique that beauty vloggers and Instagrammers are obsessing about.Who I\u2019m FollowingSam Jay, who is a very funny comedian.This weekend, once I\u2019m back in New York, I\u2019m itching to make the Healthyish squash parm and the braised short ribs from BA\u2019s March issue. Gotta get \u2018em before winter is gone!Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish EditorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletteressayRead MoreLifestyleVacation Doesn't Have to Be All About the FoodBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
