Pinoy BBQ ATBP, just off the tail-end of Highway 237, is no exception. With its sunset-orange Formica booths, walls plastered with Pacquiao posters, and a huge silver fork and spoon hung on display (a decorative mainstay in many \na Filipino home and restaurant that tells you we\u2019re serious about food), Pinoy BBQ ATBP is a temple to the kind \nof food that rarely gets lavish write-ups but actually feeds a community. I\u2019m but one member of its parish. Go for the solid, occasionally transcendent barbecue, the oxtail kare-kare (sometimes they even serve goat, vanishingly rare in the Bay), the refrigerator full of guyabano and guava juices, the stand selling Choc Nut to go, the TV blaring Philippine news, and the knowledge that you are standing in the kind of place that should also be called America\u2019s heartland, if we\u2019re to be in any way honest about America, its land, or its heart.\nAuthor, America Is Not the Heart\n\n\nElaine Castillo\n\n\nPinoy BBQ ATBP\n\n\nSanta Cruz, CA\n\nRead more\nThis diner with wall-to-wall carpeting lets me eat \nmy home fries in peace.\ncommerce editor, Bon App\u00e9tit\n\nElaheh Nozari\n\nWhen I Need a Break from Family Craziness, \nI Go Here\nLinda\u2019s Seabreeze Cafe\n\n\nSanta Ana, CA\n\u201cI love Playground because the chef, Jason [Quinn], makes whatever he feels like.

That\u2019s a phenomenon I see a lot of, especially near my old home in Los Feliz. Little Dom\u2019s is the hipster place to go, but on the next block is Puran\u2019s, the more bare-bones, less-stylish spot with food just as fantastic. They\u2019re much more focused on the food than the decor or ironic wall art\u2014and you don\u2019t have to wait an hour. I had the best spicy shrimp linguine and Dover sole on couscous there, surrounded by red walls with old Italian movie posters hung haphazardly and Charlie Chaplin films playing from a projector.

It\u2019s a restaurant that my mom and dad went to all the time; they had their own special table and the waitstaff would take care of them so nicely. When Nick [Offerman] and I come into town at the last second, they always bend over backward and go overboard to accommodate us, even with a big group of our friends. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the fact that we\u2019re famous but more because we\u2019re family. They have great ice cream, which we take back home for Mom if she can\u2019t make it. There was a period of time when my mom wasn\u2019t feeling well, and we were all very worried. We came to town for a bit, and everyone at The Metro was just incredibly kind and caring.

The indoor and outdoor seating all merges together so you can enjoy a little of both. Matthew [McConaughey] and I take the kids there for crispy chicken tenders, and we\u2019ll always get guacamole with homemade chips; brussels sprouts with pork belly, Parmesan, and maple syrup; and a few of the specials. We like to experiment and get whatever sounds good that day. Sometimes that\u2019s the fish tacos, other times beef stew\u2014depends on the weather and our moods.

Her massaman curry, bobbing with sweet potatoes, tossed with peanuts, and drizzled with coconut milk, tastes like the cloistered South I knew as a boy \nand the diverse South I now see coming into slow focus. For nine bucks and change, I get a gander of both, while slurping curry and rice and watching mud-splattered pickups loaded with ATV payloads queue at the pump.\u201d\ndirector, southern foodways alliance\n\nJohn T. Edge\n\n\nZaap Thai Kitchen\n\n\nDes Moines, IA\n\u201cFor a fix of \u200bgood food and conviviality, we go to the Cheese Bar in Des Moines. Run by proprietors C.J. and Kari Bienert, it\u2019s casual and cool, delicious and friendly. They serve a great assortment of wines and beers; stellar cheeses, salumi, and charcuterie; fantastic sandwiches, including wonderful grilled ones; light and lovely salads; and the best mac and cheese ever, baked and served \nin its own cast-iron skillet so it stays creamy, crunchy, and piping hot all the way to the last bite.\u201d\nOwners, La Quercia\n\nKathy and Herb Eckhouse\n\nCheese Bar\n\n\nPatois\nNew Orleans\n\u201cWhen my husband moved down to New Orleans five years ago to produce NCIS: New Orleans, he wanted a place walking distance from the house to have dinner every night because he doesn\u2019t cook. So when I\u2019m not in L.A. filming, Patois is like our second home. It\u2019s cozy, and it feels like family is all around you. The first time I went there I had a fried oyster salad that may have had crispy chicken skins on top. We go every week now, so they know what I like\u2014usually the lamb ribs made in a huge smoker on the sidewalk\u2014but they wait to see what I\u2019m up for that evening since I like to try something new every time. They always seem to have room, no matter how many friends or family members we have in tow.\u201d\nActress, Young Sheldon\n\n\nAnnie Potts\n\n\n\n\nChicago\n\u201cOne of my favorite restaurants in the entire United States is D4 Irish Pub, which is a short walk from my apartment in Chicago. They\u2019ve always been consistently superb. You surely won\u2019t miss the extra big smile of my favorite server, Gorin, a man who knows no strangers. Sometimes I\u2019ll go just to say hello but end up staying for the food.

We have marked almost every milestone, good and bad, sitting at the same corner bar seats. When we were building our restaurant, we ate countless rare roast beef sandwiches and Little Gem salads, hashing out our business plan, getting to know the owners, and asking \na million questions. Since we\u2019ve opened, we still manage \nto sneak in a day date or pick up lunch to go once a week. It\u2019s the kind of place where you walk in and know \nat least five other people in the place, sometimes even \nour own family members. Now we often see our regulars there, a very special full circle moment looking back to \nour first meals there when we didn\u2019t know a soul in town.\u201d\nChef, Vicia\n\nMichael Gallina \n\nUnion Loafers\n\n\nKansas City, MO\n\u201cPart of what makes me love this restaurant so much is that it reminds me of eating Chinese food as a child, before \nI became a chef and began obsessively seeking out \u2018authenticity.\u2019 The menu reads like a typical Midwestern Chinese restaurant, yet every item is the best version you can imagine: salt-and-pepper squid, golden noodles, crispy beef\u2014pea shoots with saut\u00e9ed shrimp\u2014all classic American-Chinese favorites, all done perfectly. The staff is incredible; they remembered us after the first time we went, down to our exact order. And the drinks are great, with \ntiki cocktails that have witty descriptions and cost $7.95. (It might sound like an odd pairing, but it totally works.)\u201d\nChef, The Antler Room\n\nNicholas Goellner \n\n\nPrincess Garden\n\n\nGrand Forks, ND\n\u201cOn any given Friday night, you\u2019ll often find me at the Grand Forks location of Rhombus Guys. The mini Midwest pizza chain has the best small-town parlor vibe\u2014cozy, rustic, and quirky\u2014and they serve pizzas you can only get away with here, specials like tater tot pizza and wild-rice hotdish pizza. One of my favorite things about Rhombus, however, is that there\u2019s a secret menu option, where you can order any pizza as nachos. My go-to is the Happy Pig nachos, which piles on pulled pork, barbecue sauce, peppers, onions, pineapple, and mozzarella. It helped me get over my initial shock of learning that barbecue sauce pizza is a common thing around here.\u201d\nFood blogger and cookbook author, Molly on the Range\n\nMolly Yeh\n\n\nRhombus Guys\n\n\nIndianapolis, IN\n\u201cThis Indianapolis institution is known for its smashed, extra-crispy griddle burgers.

It\u2019s the one place that hits what I consider to be all the critical points of a neighborhood place: The food is solid; there\u2019s always a beer or wine that's going to make you happy; the bartenders and servers seem familiar, even when they\u2019re new; it\u2019s cool to show up with your kids, or even your dog. Most important, it\u2019s open: They open at 11:30 a.m. every day and stay open until 10 p.m. every night, seven days a week. Maybe midnight on the weekends, but I\u2019m too old to vouch for that. That, though in my opinion, has always been the vital part of a neighborhood joint: If you\u2019re going to be there for the neighborhood, then be there for the neighborhood. Have a real menu, make it taste good, be friendly, and be open.\u201d\nRestaurateur, Littler\n\nGray Brooks\n\nGeer Street Garden\n\n\nCranston, RI\n\u201cWhenever I talk to guests at my restaurants, they ask \nwhere I like to eat out. The answer is almost always Mike\u2019s Kitchen. It\u2019s a restaurant that operates in a VFW hall in Cranston, RI. Once you walk into the place, you feel like this is where Italian-American food was born: plate-size chicken Parm, snail salad, fried smelts, clams zuppa, stuffed artichoke, polenta\u2026I could go on and on. Mike\u2019s has been around for over 30 years, and despite the recent passing of its creator, chef-owner Mike Lepizzera, the restaurant has unapologetically never changed. The servers are wary of outsiders, but once you\u2019re in, you\u2019re made. It\u2019s the greatest feeling when they are at the same time as loving as they are but completely unafraid to take you down a couple notches.\u201d\nChef, OberliN\n\nBenjamin Sukle\n\nMike\u2019s Kitchen\n\n\nClarks Summit, PA\n\u201cI don\u2019t get to make it back to Scranton very often, but \nany trip home would not be complete without visiting Colarusso\u2019s Pizza. Get a slice of their thick-crust, garlicky white pizza with tomatoes. We could get in, get out, \nand eat pizza in our pajamas; we would go there every weekend. Also, if you\u2019re ever in Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania, you should visit my mom.

And my go-to place for the best food (with the worst service) is Petite Soo Chow \nin Cliffside Park, New Jersey. Get the salt-and-pepper pork chop and soup dumplings. They have legit removed my food before I was done because the staff wanted to go home, and they asked my friend for more of a tip once, but yeah, it\u2019s awesome.\u201d\nChef, Sunday Bird\n\nDeuki Hong\n\nPetite Soo Chow\n\n\nNew York\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to find a Korean restaurant that serves soy-sauce-marinated crab, but the family behind Myung San in Flushing, Queens, makes the best version. Spring is the time to enjoy this dish because you\u2019ll find little bits of roe too. The restaurant is still family-run, and the food reminds me of my mom\u2019s cooking.

There\u2019s a nice, happy simplicity to it: wood-fired pies in a small, colorful, welcoming place.

The Inman Park area has been booming as a hot spot for young entertainers, so I was gracious for this warm and private acknowledgment.

But my friends and I would go to Giannoni\u2019s on our lunch breaks every day, and the guy Scott who runs it with his mom would always remember our orders. There\u2019s a huge board with no less than four kinds of Italian combo sandwiches, and I always got one of three sandwiches that involved the crispiest, lightly breaded thin chicken cutlets. (At first it was the Bacon-Cheddar Barbecue\u2014a chicken cutlet on a long hero with bacon, cheddar, and super sweet barbecue sauce that makes you want more and more of it.) There was also teriyaki chicken in a pita, which in my head was what I\u2019d order when I wanted to be healthy.

I\u2019ve been going since I was a freshman at Morehouse College; the one I\u2019m most fond of is on Ponce de Leon Avenue, \nbut Roswell Road is really dope too. I start with the house salad: black and green olives, mozzarella, iceberg, tomatoes, and the dressing is a beast. I then usually get two slices with extra cheese, meatballs, Italian sausage, black olives, and tomatoes, then top those bad boys \nwith the Parm at the table. Anytime I visit, especially while shooting Atlanta, I bring everyone with me. I make sure they all understand how much comfort this place gives me, and I dare them to not like anything on the menu.

It\u2019s basically a neighborhood bodega with Japanese influences. There are beautiful bento boxes and rice bowls with smoked salmon, Japanese pickles, and a soft-cooked egg, as well as a small selection of sake, wine, beer, and dry goods from Japan. The owners are extremely kind and generous; when a huge windstorm knocked out the power at our restaurant for three days, they offered me space \nin their walk-in fridge to save my fish (all 60 pounds of it!), produce, and prep.

And New York was the perfect place for it\u2014there were at least 15 good restaurants just on the walk from the subway to my apartment, including a couple of primo slice shops that I frequented...let\u2019s flatter myself and say twice a week. Then about three years ago, I moved to Los Angeles where \u201claid-back\u201d and \u201cchill\u201d might describe the vibes, but the eating is far more complicated. Not only did I have to learn what cavolo nero is (it\u2019s kale; when in doubt, everything here is kale), but more significantly, there was no more absent-mindedly grabbing a slice on the trek home and calling it dinner. Here, I have to actually think about what I want to eat and then drive in a car to go get it. \n\nThat is, until Prime Pizza opened on Fairfax Ave., only a half mile (a.k.a. ten New York City blocks!) from my West Hollywood apartment. Prime serves up downright delightful slices, albeit with a few more veggie options than I remember my Brooklyn shop having (know thy audience). But the best part? I can throw on my headphones and head there on foot, NY-style, which I figure burns off at least a fourth of the pizza calories, L.A.-style.\nwriter\n\nLauren Bans\n\nEven in L.A., I Walk \nfor Pizza\nPrime Pizza\n\n\nBack\n\nBon App\u00c9tit Media Kit\nCareers\nCond\u00c9 Nast Store\nSite Map\nRSS Feeds\naccessibility help\nnewsletter signup\nReprints/permissions\nContact Bon App\u00c9tit\nsubscription services\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresented by\n\nAll Restaurants\nEast\nCentral\nWest\n\nA few years ago, while I was taking a break from the hustle of New York City, I found myself living in a cabin on a hill in New Hampshire and owning an antique store in town. It was as idyllic as it sounds, except for the fact that it was impossible to find a decent restaurant anywhere nearby. Which is why I often found excuses to drive 45 minutes to Hilltop Caf\u00e9 in Wilton, New Hampshire. Situated on the farm that runs one of the oldest CSAs in the country, Hilltop is the best version of a country caf\u00e9\u2014the ingredients come from the farm whenever possible and the food is delicious and reliable.\n\nMore importantly, the turkey sandwich is perfect. Its greatness lies in its simplicity: locally made seedy bread with smoked turkey, cheddar, pickled onions, sprouts, and mustard finished on a panini press (never underestimate a panini press). It\u2019s the type of sandwich that reminds you of your childhood lunch but upgraded for adults. And it was always exactly what I wanted. \n\nvisuals editor, Bon App\u00e9tit\n\nEmily Eisen\n\nThe Turkey Sandwich I'd Drive 45 Minutes For\nHilltop Caf\u00e9\n\n\nBack\n\nBon App\u00c9tit Media Kit\nCareers\nCond\u00c9 Nast Store\nSite Map\nRSS Feeds\naccessibility help\nnewsletter signup\nReprints/permissions\nContact Bon App\u00c9tit\nsubscription services\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresented by\n\nAll Restaurants\nEast\nCentral\nWest\n\nAsk the average New Yorker or Angeleno what a momo is and they\u2019ll probably come up empty. \nBut ask a resident of sleepy Bloomington, Indiana, \nand not only can they identify the comforting \nTibetan dumpling, they\u2019ll point you toward Anyetsang\u2019s Little Tibet Restaurant. \n\nThe local institution has been serving Himalayan food since 1998, but this cuisine has been a town mainstay for decades. The Dalai Lama\u2019s eldest brother, Tibetan exile Thubten Norbu, was a lauded Indiana University professor and in 1979 founded what is one of America\u2019s only Tibetan cultural centers, right here in Bloomington. Little Tibet\u2019s original owner, Thupten Anyetsang, had said he wanted the place to feel like a humble Tibetan home. It\u2019s hard to miss the quaint Craftsman\u2019s hand-painted blue-and-yellow sign, where a cartoon yak poses in front of snow-capped peaks. The limestone porch is strung with prayer flags and satin tapestries and decorated with framed photos of the Dalai Lama and dusty vases holding fresh-cut flowers. \n\nNow owned by Anyetsang\u2019s nephew, Pema Wangchen, Little Tibet offers a glimpse into the surprisingly transcultural community surrounding it. Here you\u2019ll find a cross-section of exchange students, born-and-bred Hoosiers, Buddhists, Baptists, and everyone in between, all chatting it up over red lentil soup; hot, buttery Temo buns; and Kham Amdo Thukpa, a spicy meat and vegetable stew with crunchy green onions, daikon, and thick, chewy noodles cut from plump slabs of dumpling dough.\n \nAbout a month into my Ph.D. program in Bloomington, I went on a date at Little Tibet. We bent over a platter of Tsel momos, pillowy purses stuffed with tender cabbage, pan-fried until crisp around the edges, and drenched in hot sauce. The hot crackling dumpling skin gave way to a melt-in-your-mouth mishmash of sticky, toothsome dough and fragrant vegetables. The relationship might have fizzled out, but the restaurant, a few blocks from my apartment at the time and imbued with a welcoming atmosphere you can\u2019t find at the grab-and-go sub shop, stuck.\n\nPhoto by Anna Powell Teeter\n\nWriter\n\nMeredith Heil\n\nA Tibetan Oasis with Ties to the Dalai Lama in a Sleepy Indiana Town\nAnyetsang\u2019s\nLittle Tibet Restaurant\n\n\n\nBack\n\nBon App\u00c9tit Media Kit\nCareers\nCond\u00c9 Nast Store\nSite Map\nRSS Feeds\naccessibility help\nnewsletter signup\nReprints/permissions\nContact Bon App\u00c9tit\nsubscription services\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresented by\n\nAll Restaurants\nEast\nCentral\nWest\n\n\u201cMy\u201d Harold\u2019s was No. 62.

She refused to eat at No. 62 while we dated, even though it was closer than driving to Hyde Park for the same chicken, prepared the same way, in the same fat.\n\nWhen summer finally arrived after the brutal Chicago winter, I\u2019d celebrate by taking the bus to 12th Street Beach and nom on a six-piece. Fingers sticky with the fluorescent-red tangy sauce, looking out over Lake Michigan, blissed out. That is, until I hear a \u201cdamn girl, you ain\u2019t gonna share?\u201d from one of the nearby security guards, and we both laugh, knowing when she\u2019s off her shift, she\u2019s going straight to Harold\u2019s.\n\nPhoto by Matt Haas\n\nphotographer and writer\n\nOriana Koren\n\nMy Harold\u2019s Was No. 62\nHarold\u2019s Chicken\n\n\nBack\n\nBon App\u00c9tit Media Kit\nCareers\nCond\u00c9 Nast Store\nSite Map\nRSS Feeds\naccessibility help\nnewsletter signup\nReprints/permissions\nContact Bon App\u00c9tit\nsubscription services\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresented by\n\nAll Restaurants\nEast\nCentral\nWest\n\nAsk the average New Yorker or Angeleno what a momo is and they\u2019ll probably come up empty. But ask a resident of sleepy Bloomington, Indiana, and not only can they identify the comforting Tibetan dumpling, they\u2019ll point you toward Anyetsang\u2019s Little Tibet Restaurant. \n\nThe local institution has been serving Himalayan food since 1998, but this cuisine has been a town mainstay for decades. The Dalai Lama\u2019s eldest brother, Tibetan exile Thubten Norbu, was a lauded Indiana University professor and in 1979 founded what is one of America\u2019s only Tibetan cultural centers, right here in Bloomington. Little Tibet\u2019s original owner, Thupten Anyetsang, had said he wanted the place to feel like a humble Tibetan home. It\u2019s hard to miss the quaint Craftsman\u2019s hand-painted blue-and-yellow sign, where a cartoon yak poses in front of snow-capped peaks. The limestone porch is strung with prayer flags and satin tapestries and decorated with framed photos of the Dalai Lama and dusty vases holding fresh-cut flowers. \n\nNow owned by Anyetsang\u2019s nephew, Pema Wangchen, Little Tibet offers a glimpse into the surprisingly transcultural community surrounding it. Here you\u2019ll find a cross-section of exchange students, born-and-bred Hoosiers, Buddhists, Baptists, and everyone in between, all chatting it up over red lentil soup; hot, buttery Temo buns; and Kham Amdo Thukpa, a spicy meat and vegetable stew with crunchy green onions, daikon, and thick, chewy noodles cut from plump slabs of dumpling dough.\n \nAbout a month into my Ph.D. program in Bloomington, I went on a date at Little Tibet. We bent over a platter of Tsel momos, pillowy purses stuffed with tender cabbage, pan-fried until crisp around the edges, and drenched in hot sauce. The hot crackling dumpling skin gave way to a melt-in-your-mouth mishmash of sticky, toothsome dough and fragrant vegetables. The relationship might have fizzled out, but the restaurant, a few blocks from my apartment at the time and imbued with a welcoming atmosphere you can\u2019t find at the grab-and-go sub shop, stuck.\nwriter\n\nMeredith Heil\n\nRelationships Ends,\nBut Momos Are Forever\nAnyetsang\u2019s\nLittle Tibet Restaurant\n\n\n\nBack\n\nBon App\u00c9tit Media Kit\nCareers\nCond\u00c9 Nast Store\nSite Map\nRSS Feeds\naccessibility help\nnewsletter signup\nReprints/permissions\nContact Bon App\u00c9tit\nsubscription services\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresented by\n\nAll Restaurants\nEast\nCentral\nWest\n\nSevilla has been around for about 80 years, so it\u2019s not my place to draw anyone\u2019s attention to it. But it does happen to be 50 feet from my front door in the West Village, which means I know the facade as well as I know my apartment walls. It\u2019s the kind of restaurant that\u2019s still really into its Zagat review but not the kind of place that\u2019s only into its Zagat review.\n\nIt\u2019s open late and, magically, there always seem to be two seats open at the well-stocked bar. The house wine is more than decent, the sangria is great, and the drinks come with homemade potato chips that are 90 percent saltlick. It\u2019s the perfect spot to curl up in a red booth and order clams casino, paella, and garlic soup from the mostly Spanish menu. (If you intend on kissing your dining companion, it\u2019s probably a good idea for you both to order this meal.)\n\nThe staff still wears waistcoats, and all of them are the ideal blend of courteous, efficient, and gruff. Who likes a waiter who kisses your ass? This isn\u2019t Los Angeles. The place relies pretty heavily on the sauces, the presentation could stand a bit of updating, and the food is not my favorite in the neighborhood (despite the fact that \u201cqueso Manchego\u201d is its own dish\u2014respect), but this is all part of Sevilla\u2019s charm.

Top Taste, a Jamaican restaurant in Kingston, New York, sits on Hasbrouck Avenue at the triple intersection of Prince Street, Garden Street, and East O\u2019Reilly Street. The shiniest point of the star, it\u2019s a small building brightly painted in green and yellow, the colors of the Jamaican flag. You can smell the curry chicken before you walk in the door.\n\nI love Top Taste for many reasons. There\u2019s Sammy, who owns the restaurant and runs it with his wife, Malenda. Each time I pick up food from them, I\u2019m reminded of the ripple effect of a friendly conversation and how it can carry you for hours after. The shelves are stocked with Jamaican sauces and spices like Grace Jerk BBQ Sauce and Spur Tree Crushed Red Pepper Sauce; it feels like a perpetually unpacked suitcase stuffed with souvenirs from one Kingston to another. And then there\u2019s the food. The food! Sammy\u2019s jerk chicken is flavor all the way to the bone, the meat so tender that there\u2019s no need for a knife. You would leave a bit lighter on your feet if you skipped a piece of whatever cake Malenda baked that morning, but why pass up something this good? My favorite is her coconut and rum cake, a perfect ratio of sweetness to spicy rum.\n\nTop Taste isn\u2019t the food of my home, but it\u2019s the food that makes me feel at home. It helps me tie my life now, married and living in the Hudson Valley, to my childhood. I was raised in Manhattan by parents who both worked full-time. This meant I was also raised in part by Jennie, my babysitter for a decade who remains one of the most important people in my life. Jennie is from Saint Vincent, a Caribbean island about 1,000 miles east of Jamaica. When I was a kid, Jennie cooked Saint Vincentian food like stewed codfish and pelau regularly, and she loved buying Jamaican food from places like Fisherman\u2019s Cove in Brooklyn. She would share all of this food with me, and, with it, herself. When I zoom out, I realize that so much of our bond was built over Styrofoam boxes of brown stew chicken or curried goat with rice and peas, a few fried plantains tucked alongside. When I go to Top Taste, I\u2019m transported back to my childhood kitchen table\u2014and to Jennie\u2019s too.\n\nThe next time Jennie comes to visit me and my wife upstate, I can\u2019t wait to take her to Top Taste. The first time I told her about it, I could hear in her voice how relieved she was to know that, even though I don\u2019t live as close to her as I used to, really good Jamaican food was still in reach.\n\nfounder, Equity at the Table\n\nJulia Turshen\n\nTop Taste Isn't The Food of My Home, But It Makes Me Feel At Home\nTop Taste\n\n\nBack\n\nBon App\u00c9tit Media Kit\nCareers\nCond\u00c9 Nast Store\nSite Map\nRSS Feeds\naccessibility help\nnewsletter signup\nReprints/permissions\nContact Bon App\u00c9tit\nsubscription services\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresented by\n\nAll Restaurants\nEast\nCentral\nWest\n\nOn my first visit to Vientiane Asian Grocery, a Laotian market tucked inside a south Seattle shopping plaza, I had ambitions of stocking up on pantry items\u2014fish sauce, chiles, pickled green peppercorns. But before I even made it into the aisles, I succumbed to the call of a few tables with orange folding chairs at the front of the store: a modest restaurant made bright by fluorescent lights and colorful flowers hanging from the ceiling. After one taste of the house-made spicy pork sausage bursting with lemongrass, chiles, and cilantro, I knew I\u2019d be coming back. \n\nBecause Vientiane is just a short drive from my house, it\u2019s become my go-to place for lunch with my husband or a close friend who lives nearby. Meals that are meant to be short inevitably turn into leisurely lunches with long, heartening conversations. Over\nthe years, under the approving gaze of the older women who cook the food, as well as the golden Buddhas behind the cash register where you place your order, I\u2019ve enjoyed flash-fried sticky beef jerky and nam khao\u2014a salad made with wonderfully chewy sour pork skin and crispy rice. I've had steaming bowls of fish khao poon, a noodle soup with a fragrant orange broth that sings of citrus, red curry, lemongrass, and coconut. And after each meal, I find myself heading down the far right aisle to the refrigerator case to grab a ziptop bag of the spicy pork sausage that first hooked me\u2014I always want to take a bit of the warmth and flavor of this place home. I\u2019ve got five bags in my freezer.\n\nPhoto by Charity Burggraaf\n\nauthor, Like a Mother\n\nAngela Garbes\n\nI Came for Fish Sauce. \nI Came Back (Again, and\nAgain) for That Sausage\nVientiane Asian Grocery\n\n\nBack\n\nBon App\u00c9tit Media Kit\nCareers\nCond\u00c9 Nast Store\nSite Map\nRSS Feeds\naccessibility help\nnewsletter signup\nReprints/permissions\nContact Bon App\u00c9tit\nsubscription services\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresented by\n\nAll Restaurants\nEast\nCentral\nWest\n\nI\u2019ve made the six-hour flight from New York to California approximately 50 times in the past 28 years, for really no other reason than to aimlessly putter around my grandparents\u2019 house in Santa Cruz. An engineering professor from central Pennsylvania, my grandfather had dreams of growing old in a university town by the beach. My grandmother, on the other hand, did not, but when my grandpa bought a small house on a whim in 1990, she reluctantly followed him and lived there until she died in 2009.\n\nThe one place where I\u2019ve consistently eaten during all those visits is an unassuming little place called Linda\u2019s Seabreeze Cafe. It\u2019s your standard breakfast-and-lunch-only spot where the egg specials come with a pile of greasy, crispy home fries; every plate is garnished with an orange slice and parsley; and you pray that whoever sat at the table before you didn\u2019t double dip their spoon into the jam jar. There\u2019s often\n a wait (a good sign!), but luckily there\u2019s a coffee pot, mugs, and benches set up outside so those 20 minutes don\u2019t feel too dire. Wall-to-wall carpeting absorbs \nthe sounds of the 14 tables filled with locals ordering \u201cthe usual\u201d and day-trippers fueling up before a day \nat the beach.\n\nDepending on the time of day, I\u2019ll either get two fried eggs with toast or a tuna salad sandwich. I\u2019m well aware that I can make both of those dishes just as well in my grandpa\u2019s kitchen, but that\u2019s exactly why I love it. It\u2019s familiar food that I can eat in peace\u2014the latter being something that\u2019s hard to come by at my grandpa\u2019s home, which functions as a headquarters of sorts for my mom\u2019s quirky, and some might say dysfunctional, side of the family. My mom and her five younger siblings fight over everything from how clean the cutting board is to who last moved my grandma\u2019s ashes (true story\u2014as of 2014 they were placed in the closet of the guest bedroom). Something is always broken and waiting on my uncle to fix\u2014last time I was there it was the hot water and the dishwasher. When the craziness becomes too much to process, like when my uncle dumped a freestanding spiral staircase from the flea market in the driveway, I and whichever immediate family member happens to be with me need a breath of fresh air. And five minutes away, in the calming wall-to-wall carpeted dining room of Linda\u2019s, with a Diet Coke and a too-large side of potatoes that I will inevitably finish, I know I can always get it.\ncommerce editor, Bon App\u00e9tit\n\nElaheh Nozari\n\nWhen I Need a Break from Crazy, I Go Here\nLinda\u2019s Seabreeze Cafe\n\n\nBack\n\nBon App\u00c9tit Media Kit\nCareers\nCond\u00c9 Nast Store\nSite Map\nRSS Feeds\naccessibility help\nnewsletter signup\nReprints/permissions\nContact Bon App\u00c9tit\nsubscription services\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresented by\n\nAll Restaurants\nEast\nCentral\nWest\n\nIt is difficult to explain to people who have never been to New Mexico what New Mexican food tastes like. They think they know\u2014they\u2019ve all had enchiladas at least once in their life\u2014but they don\u2019t really know, you can\u2019t really know, because it is close to impossible to get good Hatch chile outside of the state. Hatch chile is our local pepper, which is harvested and roasted over two months in late summer, and during that time, the smell fills the air everywhere you go. The chiles are made into sauces\u2014the fresh (spicier) sauce is green, while the sauce made from dried and pulverized chile is a silky rust red; when you order both on a plate, it is called Christmas. Sure, the sauce can be shipped elsewhere, but it never retains the smoky zip of the just-made version, which is why in order to understand what New Mexican food really tastes like, you simply have to be in New Mexico. There is no way around it. Other local delicacies: sopaipillas (fried pillows of dough that you gnaw the corner off of and then fill with watery honey, preferably from a cheap to-go squirt packet), fideos (like spaghetti but soaked in chile sauce), chiles rellenos (a Hatch chile pepper stuffed with cheese and deep-fried; decadent and exquisite). \n\nYou can find all of these items at Richard\u2019s, an unassuming New Mexican joint that lives inside a strip mall off the freeway, and is one of my favorite restaurants in the whole world. It is often the first place I will go when I get off a plane when visiting home, because there is something about being in Albuquerque that feels incomplete without a giant plate of corn tortillas swimming in a moat of red sauce and melted cheddar and a bird\u2019s nest of shredded iceberg lettuce. Richard\u2019s is only open for breakfast and lunch, which is another thing I love about it. The idea is to eat the biggest, most indulgent meal of the day early on and then give yourself the entire afternoon to recover.\n\nPhoto by Maggie Shannon\n\nwriter\n\nRachel Syme\n\nNew Mexican Food Just Isn\u2019t New Mexican Food Outside of New Mexico\nRichard\u2019s\n\n\nBack\n\nBon App\u00c9tit Media Kit\nCareers\nCond\u00c9 Nast Store\nSite Map\nRSS Feeds\naccessibility help\nnewsletter signup\nReprints/permissions\nContact Bon App\u00c9tit\nsubscription services\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresented by\n\nAll Restaurants\nEast\nCentral\nWest\n\nGentrification doesn\u2019t look the same in rural places as it does in cities, but it is still possible for one way of life to edge out another. In Morgantown, West Virginia, where I grew up, it\u2019s not hipsters who gentrify; it\u2019s developers, with shopping centers and chain restaurants offering mass-produced folksiness or fanciness. This is often called progress. The section of highway that was rerouted in 2011 around Ruby and Ketchy\u2019s\u2014a 60-year-old literal mom-and-pop diner\u2014is also progress. But the highway grazes Ruby and Ketchy\u2019s like a crop duster over a field; it redirects traffic around and above it. \n\nI worried for a long while that one day I would come home and the little boxy building would be gone, and with it my mother\u2019s memories of taking her father to breakfast after his chemotherapy appointments, my memories of fried chicken dinners after basketball games. But the restaurant was, and is, fine. Sometimes we perceive a threat and only then register how much we value what is threatened. When the highway came, I emotionally doubled down on Ruby and Ketchy\u2019s and everything it represented to me about Appalachian life: the soup beans and cornbread (Thursdays), the cabbage rolls (Fridays), the local advertisements on the place mats, the regulars at the counter. I\u2019m not saying that every place should be Ruby and Ketchy\u2019s, but I\u2019m grateful that Ruby and Ketchy\u2019s is still Ruby and Ketchy\u2019s, and that driverly convenience wasn\u2019t what had been keeping it\nin business.\n\nPhoto by Billy Wolfe\n\nwriter\n\ncourtney balestier\n\nRuby and Ketchy\u2019s \nIs Still Ruby and Ketchy\u2019s\n\nRuby & Ketchy\u2019s\n\n\nBack\n\nBon App\u00c9tit Media Kit\nCareers\nCond\u00c9 Nast Store\nSite Map\nRSS Feeds\naccessibility help\nnewsletter signup\nReprints/permissions\nContact Bon App\u00c9tit\nsubscription services", "date": "2018-05-21", "author": []}
