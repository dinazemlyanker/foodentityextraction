If you can\u2019t find the electric orange French cheese, use Parmesan, aged Gouda, or aged cheddar as a substitute. Each alternative will lend its own flavor to the final dish, but at the end of the day they\u2019re still potatoes covered in cheese, and that\u2019s never a bad thing.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.
