(I don\u2019t know what to tell you. Life is short and the commercial breaks during The Bachelor are long.) Plus, face massages are amazing. Really: Put down your coffee or kombucha or whatever and gently press your (clean) index fingers into the center of your forehead, just above your brows. Doesn\u2019t that feel soothing? Am I right, or am I totally, completely, without-a-doubt right?That\u2019s the thinking behind gua sha, an East Asian form of massage that\u2019s garnered a big following on Instagram just like jade rollers before it\u2014at least in part. \u201cGua sha uses a facial tool to massage the skin to relieve tension in the muscles, move lymphatic fluid, and increase blood circulation in the skin,\u201d says Y. Claire Chang, M.D., a board-certified cosmetic dermatologist at Union Square Laser Dermatology in New York. Activating the lymphatic system, which ferries toxins, waste, and excess fluid away from your cells, can result in clearer, smoother skin. And by deeply kneading and thus loosening your facial muscles, gua sha boosts circulation and in turn ensures that skin cells get essential nutrients from your blood supply. It\u2019s like a foam roller for your face.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Fans of gua sha say that it can also minimize fine lines and wrinkles, boost skin\u2019s elasticity (so it looks firmer), and give skin a glow almost instantly. That immediate transformation is why Britta Plug, a holistic facialist and founder of New York City\u2019s Studio Britta, began incorporating it into her facials. \u201cI noticed that when I started incorporating this into my treatments, skin was changing beneath my fingertips,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was getting firmer. Loose, saggy tissue felt tighter under my hands, it was less puffy, and muscles were releasing\u2014and it\u2019s all working by influencing the body\u2019s internal systems.\u201dChang\u2019s a little more skeptical. \u201cWhile gua sha may...decrease facial puffiness, there is no evidence that it actually prevents skin aging and facial wrinkles,\u201d she says. \u201cGua sha is definitely not equivalent to botulinum toxin [Botox], which helps decrease facial muscle movement, the root cause of facial wrinkles.\u201d Speaking of: Plug informs me that gua sha and injectables don\u2019t mix, so when I arm myself with a few gua sha tools and get started, I\u2019m careful to avoid my recently Botox-ed forehead. (Alas, scowling at people for nearly 30 years has a downside.) Active acne, open wounds, and irritated skin are also a no-go.Plug recommends applying an oil first, which enables the tool to glide over skin. I pair Kora Organics Rose Quartz Heart Facial Sculptor with my usual moisturizer. While I like the tool\u2014the heart shape makes it easy to hug the curves of the face\u2014the moisturizer doesn\u2019t give me much slip. I find way more success when I use it the next night with True Botanicals Pre Cleanse Oil. Not only does it smell herbal and calming, it also offers just the right amount of lubrication so it doesn\u2019t tug or pull on my skin.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.I follow the guide in this Mount Lai video, skipping the initial forehead portion and starting instead on my neck. Plug suggested beginning here: Holding your skin taut at the base of your neck with one hand, sweep the tool upwards and under your jaw. This helps get the lymph fluid moving, she says.I then follow the rest of the video, pressing it along my jawbone, cheekbones, and orbital bones. It feels really, really nice, as if my face were able to contort myself into pigeon pose. I know from yoga that I tend to clench my jaw, so massaging my jawbone from chin to ear is deeeeeeply relaxing. But besides some slight redness afterwards, I don\u2019t notice much of a difference after my first go.Next, I try Mount Lai\u2019s Jade Gua Sha Facial Lifting Tool. It\u2019s roughly half the price of the Kora Organics Sculptor, and the biggest difference is in the weight and bulk of the stone. The Kora tool did a lot of the heavy lifting as far as applying pressure, but I find that the notch in Mount Lai\u2019s conformed to the curves of my face more comfortably. Again, I don\u2019t notice any lifting, although\u2026do my smile lines look a little fainter? (Or maybe my eyesight is waning.)There\u2019s not much of a difference after a few days of alternating the two\u2014in my skin, at least. Because while my face doesn\u2019t necessarily look better, it certainly feels better. The tension I hold in the lower half of my face is less noticeable after just one session. Gua sha makes for a very relaxing five minutes, and unlike jade rollers, I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s a waste of my time. If anything, it\u2019s totally worth it.Buy it: Mount Lai Gua Sha Facial Lifting Tool, $28.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
