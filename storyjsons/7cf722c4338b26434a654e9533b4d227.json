This airy all-day, all-evening caf\u00e9 makes almost everything in-house, from pastries to rillettes, and you\u2019ll want to park yourself at the bar and make a day of it.ORDER THE: entire breakfast menu. It\u2019s only nine items, so it\u2019s not hard to order everything, especially the bite-size pikelets (English-style pancakes) topped with salted butter; the spoonable soft scramble; and all the house-made sausages, bacon, and thick-cut toast (available all together in sandwich form or separate for purchase at Larry\u2019s butcher shop, Boucherie Lawrence). Buy the carr\u00e9 blanc (a.k.a. Pullman loaf) as a souvenir or a snack for the trip back home. Security may stop you to ask what that delicious buttery smell coming from your tote bag is. Just smile and nod.THE VIBE IS: compact yet welcoming. Expect to be squeezed into a table very close to strangers, but they\u2019ll likely be charming residents of the neighborhood and offer you recommendations for local boutiques and hole-in-the-wall bars.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day 8 a.m. to 1 a.m.\u2014Alyse WhitneyPhoto by Dominique LafondPhoto by Dominique LafondWE ALSO LOVEBoucherie LawrenceAll the Mile End goods to smuggle back homeDrogheria FineRun, don\u2019t walk to this Mile End window shop doling out perfectly tender gnocchiSt-Viateur Bagel ShopSettle the great bagel debate by getting a dozen at the famed Mile End mini chainExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
