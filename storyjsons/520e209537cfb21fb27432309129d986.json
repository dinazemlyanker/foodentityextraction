I have a few ideas.

But thankfully, per Newton\u2019s Third Law, things will come back around when a 10-pound box of tangerines shows up in the middle of frigid February. One of the best things you can get in the mail.Last Christmas, when my family asked what I wanted, I replied: BIG BOX OF TANGERINES. I sent the link to OjaiPixies.com. You have to order them a few weeks/months in advance, so when they show up on a snowy winter day right when you totally forgot you made that bossy request, well, what a pleasant surprise!The tangerines\u2014or oranges, grapefruit, lemons, a few avocados, you have a lot of choices\u2014are from Friend\u2019s Ranch in Ojai, California, 2,315 miles away from me. Last year, I ordered a mixed box that had several varieties of seeded, seedless, tiny and big tangerines, all as sweet as candy and cute as a button. Some are so small they fit into your puffer coat pockets, which is a great place to store them. These seasonal California tangerines make the year-round oranges I buy here in Michigan (for cocktails only) look like plastic props in comparison, bitter and bland.And this year, demand for the Pixies has only grown. In fact, you have to keep checking back on the Friend\u2019s Ranch site to catch its restocks every Tuesday, at around 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. ET. I just snagged \u201cThe Plain Jane\u201d box this week, which I\u2019m crossing my fingers contains a few avocados. Yes, there\u2019s hype for seasonal fruit now. Set your calendar alert. Do what you need to do!Sidenote: Some of the fancy citrus have great names like \u201cYosemite Gold\u201d and \u201cGold Nuggets,\u201d which remind me of greedy men sifting rocks in dried riverbeds. If only they knew where the real riches were! (In their hearts\u2014and in mail-order citrus farming.)I WILL be adapting this grapefruit pound cake with whatever shows up in my \u201cPlain Jane\u201d box.\u00a0\nAlex LauWith 10 pounds of citrus, what to do?! I juiced a few seedy but supersweet Dancy tangerines into a mason jar, then dropped in a halved jalape\u00f1o to make margaritas with later. I juiced a few more to make my favorite poppyseed pound cake, which is moister-than-moist thanks to all that juice. Citrus salads with fatty cheeses or fatty avocado for contrast. Upside-down cakes. Curd bars! Candied peels. Homemade house cleaner. Marmalade! I gave them out to coworkers and friends. I peeled them and snacked on them and then had that dreaded-wonderful orange scent stuck on my hands all day. If you think 10 pounds of citrus is too much for a single person, I\u2019m sorry to say that\u2019s just a lack of imagination.Photo by Emma FishmanOjai Pixie TangerinesShop Now at Ojai PixiesShop Now at Friend's RanchExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendShoppingRead Morerecipes37 Citrus Recipes to Put Some Pep in Your Winter StepGallery37 SlidesBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
