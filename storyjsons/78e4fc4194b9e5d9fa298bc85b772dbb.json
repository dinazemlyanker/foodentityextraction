Quite the opposite. His next-gen mothership is a temple of food, for sure, but above all it\u2019s a temple of learning for his cooks, men and women from around the world who have been given more room to create and explore in a sprawling campus of kitchens, labs, and gardens.ORDER THE: well, you don\u2019t really have a choice! The set menu is seafood from January to June, vegetables June to early fall, and game through December. A meal here expands the mind, palate, and eye as hyperlocal and seasonal produce is used to craft poetic dishes that are built with layers of skill and meaning.THE VIBE IS: reverent but the opposite of stuffy. Like the dining room, it\u2019s light and open. The T-shirted staff is friendly\u2014and you\u2019ll meet many of them as they serve you throughout your meal. Try to come early for (or linger later on in) the cozy lounge, where you can sip all sorts of crazy things, like koji-fermented barley milk.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Tuesday through Saturday, from 5 p.m. to midnight. Closed Sunday and Monday. Reservations for the season are available several months in advance, so hover over your computer or keep checking Noma's Tock calendar. Sign up for its newsletter for alerts too. You\u2019re strangely better off finding a table if there are more of you\u2014or you might be able to squeak a solo spot at the group table that also serves as a 20-seat private dining room. Ten percent of tables per service are reserved for students, who receive a very nice discount with ID.\u2014Christine MuhlkePhoto by Ditte IsagerPhoto by Ditte IsagerWE ALSO LOVEAmassHidden in Refshale\u00f8en, an elaborate root-to-stem tasting menuSanchezMexican food by way of Scandinavia in Vesterbro Rel\u00e6Live a little with the N\u00f8rrebro tasting-menu restaurant that\u2019s still making waves Explore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
