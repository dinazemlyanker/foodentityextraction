Stirred into cocktails. Poured into beers. Cynar does it all.By Alex DelanyMay 15, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Laura Murray, props by Allie WistFacebookTwitterEmailWelcome to Glass Half Full, a monthly column from drinks editor Alex Delany about what he\u2019s drinking (and loving) right now.Here\u2019s the short sell on Cynar: It\u2019s an Italian amaro that\u2019s been around forever. It\u2019s loaded with flavor. It\u2019s low-ABV. It\u2019s versatile. It\u2019s consistent. And it\u2019s accessible across the USA. Cool? You\u2019re a Cynar (pronounced chee-nar) fan now? Awesome. You can leave and go buy a bottle, if you\u2019d like. Or you could stay for a minute while I wax poetic about why I always keep a stash at home.Developed in Venice in the 1950s, the main flavor of note here is artichoke, which gives it a vegetal bitterness that\u2019s balanced by notes of green sugar cane and raisins. It falls pretty solidly in the middle of the bitter-sweet amaro spectrum; not crazy bitter, not crazy sweet. Cynar is an amaro for all seasons, if you will, which makes it especially perfect right now, when I\u2019m looking to use the contents of my bar in as many different ways as possible.That balance is part of the reason I find it so flexible and easy to use. I\u2019ll substitute it in place of sweet vermouth in cocktails like the Negroni, Americano, or the Manhattan for a deeper, more bitter dimension. I love it in a Lil\u2019 Ripper and a proper spritz. The first time I dropped an ounce into a Budweiser I understood what a revelation felt like. But when I\u2019m feeling lazy, I\u2019ll just pour a couple fingers in a rocks glass with a large ice cube and add a slice of citrus peel and call it a day. However I serve it, though, it\u2019s rare that I\u2019ll just have one: At just 16.5% ABV (compared to your average whiskey or tequila\u2019s 40-45%), Cynar is good for drink after drink.With all the mileage that this amaro sees in my house, shouldn\u2019t I be worried about blowing through my supply right now? Nope, I\u2019m all set. Those geniuses over at the Cynar factory knew to package it in a 1 liter bottle.Buy it: Cynar 1 Liter Bottle, $30 at DrizlyExplore Bon App\u00e9titGlass Half FullRecipes you want to make.
