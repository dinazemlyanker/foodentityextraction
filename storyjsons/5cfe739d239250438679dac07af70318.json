Whatever bubbly you have on hand works: Champagne, Prosecco, cava\u2026any of these will bring the party and leave whoever you\u2019re toasting feeling wonderful.\u201d Pear juice, available at most grocery stores, adds a sweetness and subtle fruitiness that balances this drink nicely.IngredientsMakes 1Oleo-saccharum4lemons, scrubbed1cup sugarCocktail\u00bccup sugar\u00betsp. ground cinnamon1lemon slice1\u00bcoz. pear juice\u00beoz. absinthe4dashes orange bitters3oz. sparkling winePreparationOleo-saccharumStep 1Using a vegetable peeler, remove zest from lemons, avoiding white pith.

Let sit at room temperature in a dark place 24 hours. Add 1 cup room-temperature water and stir until sugar is dissolved; discard zest.CocktailStep 2Mix sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl and pour onto a small plate.

I wish i was them. AnonymousA house8/9/2021Really Fruity! Love it! Moralteaa house8/9/2021Really fruity! Love it! moraltea 8/9/2021Made this for NYE. I used St. George absinthe which is made nearby. I don\u2019t recommend drinking the absinthe by itself, it\u2019s way too intense, although I like other liquors. The cocktail was unique and felt winters because of the anise flavor of the absinthe. I tried the original recipe and also tried using 0.5 oz absinthe and 1 oz. oleo saccharum.  I found the latter more palatable, but maybe it was just because my absinthe was really intense. I also don\u2019t have a vegetable peeler and used a paring knife for the lemons, which was pretty tricky. Overall would make again.
