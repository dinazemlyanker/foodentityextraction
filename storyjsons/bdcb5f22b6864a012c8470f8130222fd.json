No!\u00a0By Alex BeggsNovember 20, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Laura MurrayFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.My stepmom keeps a basket of fake fruit on her kitchen ledge. The bananas are a little green, the apples ruddy\u2014they look real. She puts the stickers from real apples on the fake ones to throw you off even further. It\u2019s hilarious and delightful. My sister falls for it every time. Plastic banana, foiled again!Fake fruit as decor takes many forms, and I love what it represents: the edible made inedible. It can\u2019t satisfy the appetite, and yet it\u2019s somehow still so...satisfying. It\u2019s biblical, you know, because forbidden fruit. A bowl of fake fruit is an illusion of abundance; it will never feed you.My latest obsession are these beautiful Italian wax food candles sold at John Derian, the eccentric, expensive home goods store that has no equal. (On my last visit to the store, there was a robotic black cat waving in the window.)High-rollers can get the two-wick, red-wax cheese wheels with a wedge missing. Elaborate faux-frosted cakes in an array of tier options ($58 to $68). The fruit candles, however, are some of the most affordable things in the shop, and I want all of them. The bulbous eggplants and spiky artichokes. Firm bananas and shiny apples. Those are all around $18 to $25, depending on the size. They\u2019re expertly painted. It looks like they were plucked from a fruit bowl in a Renaissance still life and made 3D. I don\u2019t like to have things that go unused, so I\u2019d probably burn them when people are over to watch them melt into colorful puddles.Do people give \u201chost/hostess\u201d gifts still? If so, this is a great one\u2014better than any random bottle of wine that\u2019s gonna gather dust in a cabinet. It fits into a stocking, if that\u2019s your kink. It\u2019s perfect for the person with better taste than you who is impossible to buy for. And when\u2019s the last time you saw a pillar candle, anyway? Lighting is always in demand. Or you can gather an assortment in a bowl and wait for unsuspecting guests to take a bite.Buy them: Cereria Introna Candles, $15 to $68 at John DerianAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
