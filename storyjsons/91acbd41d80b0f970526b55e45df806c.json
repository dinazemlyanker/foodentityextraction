Packed with herbs, it's a no-brainer for a seasonal veggies-and-dip situation, but can easily be dressed up to suit any occasion. Swap the herbs and vinegar for lime juice and zest and you've got a perfect taco-topper. Add some chipotles in adobo to make a spicy, smoky bottom-of-the-plate schmear for roasted veggies. Or spike it with some grated garlic and thin it with lemon juice for a killer dairy-free ranch dressing.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I used parsley and dill. I ended up adding more herbs, plus garlic, lemon juice and zest, more vinegar, and a touch more salt. I\u2019d make this again but maybe with cilantro or something with a stronger flavor so that it can cut the creaminess of the cashews. BUT, with some nice spicy radishes, I enjoyed this all the same. yagurlcarlyTucson, Arizona7/3/2020Love this! How long does it keep in the fridge?jordanreyn0ldsAtlanta4/18/2020I have been making this recipe intuitively for about a year now, tweaking a few ingredients here and there. It\u2019s so pleasing and versatile. Adding more water to produce a sauce for drizzling, or less so you can have a thicker, viscous spread. Replacing the herbs with carrots, ginger, and a tad of cumin provides some fun variety. I\u2019ll have to try the cashew soaking step next time! AnonymousArcata, CA1/22/2020I don't even soak the cahsews.  Roasted cashews make a delicious sauce.  Also lots of garlic.  Yup.  AnonymousNYC5/9/2019I love this! I make it all the time and everyone who has tried it loves it. I\u2019ve used cilantro and Italian parsley so far. The tablespoon of salt is perfect I think as long as you use kosher salt. AnonymousSeattle 1/6/2019Don't use the soaking liquid!! It contains enzyme inhibitors and phytic acid that you're trying to get rid of by soaking. AnonymousLos Angeles5/15/2018I NEVER write reviews, but this is AMAZING!!! I do want to use it on everything.  I just did the Whole30 and am adding this recipe as a staple for my diet.  I used flat leaf parsley, dill, and chives.  Incredible.  AnonymousBlacksburg, VA5/4/2018Really tasty! I used parsley, and chives and ramps from my garden. I decreased the salt to 1tsp. but might add a bit more. I\u2019m glad I bought enough raw cashews for a batch in the future. Giving it 5 stars for taste, inventiveness, versatility, and ease of preparation. Shannon DVancouver, WA5/2/2018Loved this! I used a mix of cilantro, chives and flat parsley. I started with a pinch of salt and it needed two, glad I didn\u2019t add the full TB that would have been too much. \nDelicious, will certainly make regularly since so many friends are dairy freettrockwoodNYC5/1/2018A tablespoon of salt I found was way too much. Unfortunately, no one could eat it! I think a teaspoon would have been sufficient. :)gowldenVancouver, BC, Canada4/28/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titSauceCondimentCrudit\u00e9CashewNutEasyQuickStarterSnackDairy-FreeVeganVegetarianGluten-FreeBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
