Shoes off! Bring me Settlers of Catan expansion packs instead of wine! No dogs allowed! Texas beers only! So when I asked about dietary restriction etiquette questions, answered a few, and then saw readers\u2019 comments about how they deal with guests on certain diets...I was horrified at all of the people who blanket said: THEY\u2019RE NOT INVITED. That\u2019s sad, y\u2019all. Ask your vegan pals to bring a dish, try it and hate it, but goodness gracious, it\u2019s not that offensive. No one owes anyone anything but kindness and maybe some cold beer. I think we might all be overthinking this thing.ZuckergoatIn Rolling Stone\u2019s interview with Jack \u201cbrings his own organic wine to restaurants\u201d Dorsey, an anecdote about Mark Zuckerberg killing and cooking a goat for dinner has gone viral. I don\u2019t know why people are so shocked. He literally turned his backyard into FARMVILLE! It makes sense to me. I can picture it. Zuck wakes up, sips bulletproof coffee on his back deck and points to a sweet, purring goat chomping on a first generation iPod. \u201cThat one,\u201d he says to the empty air in his toneless voice, pointing like a kid at the Red Lobster tank. But Alexa hears, and shoots lasers at the goat before playing the French techno station Zuck is into right now, his Goat Phase.Remember the Facebook Live barbecue stream where he ran out of things to say and just listed all of the foods a person can smoke? Good thing Facebook Live has fizzled out, otherwise who knows what kind of backyard-to-table goat grilling would have come next.Photo by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, Prop Styling by Emily EisenMake this soupDon\u2019t tell me lamb is too \u201cgamey\u201d for you, Jack. It\u2019s delicious and rich in this lamb and squash soup Andy Baraghani developed last winter. I made it over the freezing weekend and realized what a unique recipe it is. You brown the lamb and cook it with warm spices, okay. But then, in a blender, you mix up this roasted chile and charred onion salsa/sauce. Once the soup is nearly done and you\u2019ve added the squash, you stir the chile sauce in to give body and a heckton of flavor. Serve with feta on top (!) and a side of crusty baguette and some kind of funky red wine. (FYI my soup was definitely not as red as the photo. Not sure how they pulled that off. I also doubled the recipe, because I knew I\u2019d want leftovers.)Get the recipe: Lamb and Winter Squash SoupPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensAnd for something sweetI also made this Basque-style cheesecake, a custardy, fluffy cheesecake you cook at high heat, causing this nearly-burnt exterior that Molly Baz described as \u201ca worn leather wallet.\u201d Read more about it here. Again, mine did NOT look like this perfectly browned one; it was patchy and mountainous. It still made me immensely happy. Bake it!Get the recipe: Basque Burnt CheesecakeUnnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekRecently our corporate overlords blessed us with some random free office snacks. The tactic worked! We\u2019re all walking around with crumbs on our faces and the oblivious smiles of stock photo office people. We\u2019ve started measuring the stress of the workday in bags of Munchies snack mix. \u201cIt\u2019s a two Munchie day,\u201d sighed Christina Chaey when she saw me eyeballing her fresh bag. The magazine was on a strict deadline, I deducted. There are classic Lay\u2019s, Doritos, those packets of peanut butter crackers, granola bars, a tray of possibly red delicious apples (the jury\u2019s out, they\u2019re mysteriously delicious \u201conly when ice cold,\u201d per Emily Schultz) and bananas, and shared glass jars of M&Ms, pretzels, trail mix, and peanuts. Kate Fenoglio mixes the pretzels and M&M\u2019s \u201cwhen I\u2019m feeling fancy\u201d and we\u2019ve now deemed it \u201cKate Mix.\u201d Emma Wartzman toggles between peanuts and peanut butter crackers, a real rule-breaker, that one. Sarah Jampel votes for the odd trail mix that includes raw (stale) dried coconut, \u201chard to come by\u201d dried pineapple, and inexplicable sunflower seeds. In our poll, the green bananas won out. \u201cThe advanced move,\u201d said Alex Delany, who speaks as if someone is about to scribe all of this onto a rock somewhere ancient, \u201cis to take three green bananas and leave them on your desk, so they ripen over the next few days. Then you have three free perfectly ripe bananas. Patience is a virtue.\u201d I prefer a green banana, following every sharp, grassy bite with a spoonful of peanut butter, a two-handed technique that completely debilitates you from working on anything else. Who\u2019s the philosopher now? Alex the elder, I think.Amiel would like me to let you know he thought it said \u201cgermy shared PEANUTS.\u201d So.Have a snacky weekend,Alex BeggsSenior Staff WriterExplore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecultureIs It Ever Okay...
