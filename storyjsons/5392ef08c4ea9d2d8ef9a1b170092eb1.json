Quarantine gave him a chance to step back.\u00a0By Matt Horn, as told to Hilary CadiganAugust 26, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto courtesy Horn BarbecueFacebookTwitterEmailWhen I was growing up, my mom used to say, \u201cI never want my son to be a firefighter. He\u2019ll run right into the fire.\u201d I became a pitmaster instead (different kind of fire), but she was right. Once I see a challenge, I embrace it, face it, and try to endure. Opening a restaurant during a pandemic is just another challenge.Since 2016 I\u2019ve been doing barbecue pop-ups in Oakland. Those are 48-hour days: I\u2019m buying the meat, prepping the meat, and sacrificing my sleep to cook it for 16 hours. Then I have to serve it, give customers that one-on-one experience\u2014preparing the cuts they want, having personal conversations\u2014and then clean up. By the time I go home, I\u2019m exhausted physically as well as emotionally. The last thing on my mind is \u201cHey, I\u2019m going to go in the kitchen to cook up a meal!\u201d No way. I\u2019m gonna order some takeout from the place down the street.But since the pandemic started, things are different. It\u2019s made me focus more on cooking here at home. It\u2019s made me rely on the reasons I love to cook in the first place. Watching a fire takes me to a meditative state\u2014complete peace. I\u2019ve always said that if no one showed up to my pop-ups, I would be fine because I\u2019m completely in love with what I do. Quarantine is proof of that: I find the same pleasure in cooking a 200-pound hog in my backyard brick pit as I do in making grilled cheese sandwiches and plain omelettes for my kids, Matty and Leilani, who are four and three.Photo courtesy Horn BarbecueDuring quarantine I\u2019ve been able to spend a lot of one-on-one time with them, in their little world of toys and licorice and YouTube. I\u2019ve had time to hone family recipes, like my grandmother\u2019s cheesy potato casserole, which I plan to serve at the restaurant when we open. The other day she came by and tasted it. She didn\u2019t say, \u201cThis is great.\u201d She didn\u2019t say it was bad. She just looked at me, smiled, and told me she was proud of me. I\u2019ll take that.When I open up the restaurant, it\u2019s going to take time away from my family. I understand that, and they understand that too. But I\u2019m trying to implement systems where neither me nor my employees are working all the time. We\u2019re not going to be open seven days a week. We\u2019re going to be open three to four days. And once we sell out, that\u2019s it\u2014we go home.Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
