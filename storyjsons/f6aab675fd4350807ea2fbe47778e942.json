At this stage of relatively early parenthood, I\u2019ve figured out how to get salmon in the oven and have managed to even chop and saut\u00e9 a vegetable.But my weekday cooking ambitions have definitely simmered down from my pre-baby life, and I\u2019m okay with that because Brooklyn Delhi\u2019s tomato achaar exists. This slightly spicy amalgam of tomatoes, garlic, salt, black mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds, turmeric, asafetida, tamarind, sesame oil, and sugar is exactly what my salmon needs. Actually, not just my salmon but also green beans, eggs, chicken, rice, toast, and anything else I make that needs that little extra zhuzh.\u00a0It sounds like a cop-out to say that it goes with everything, but I haven\u2019t met a savory application that it doesn\u2019t work with. My favorite use is probably that random melange of leftovers I bring to the office for lunch\u2014last week it was potatoes, broccoli, red onions, and a garlic-lemon sauce (yes, I made sauce\u2026) that was somehow still bland. I spooned some achaar on it and desk lunch was SAVED.As of this year, Brooklyn Delhi\u2019s products are now at Whole Foods nationwide, which also means\u2026 Amazon\u2014and the realization that my favorite flavor booster is just a click or walk away.Brooklyn Delhi Tomato Achaar$12 at Snuk Foods$10 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendShoppingCondiment/SpreadRead MorecookingWhat Is Harissa, the Spicy, Peppery Condiment We Will Never Quit?By Alex DelanyRecipes you want to make.
