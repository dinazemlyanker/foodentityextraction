Both of us had spent the majority of our teens and 20s using them as staff at different coffee shops, bars, and restaurants, so it didn\u2019t strike me as odd to see these giant industrial kitchen shelves at home\u2014until a friend pointed them out. You see, I explained to said skeptical friend, although they\u2019re not quite as cozy, their convenience and functionality far outweigh (literally, these are tanks) the cuteness of your typical pantry shelving setup.A lot of brands make something similar, but Metro shelving is the Kleenex of heavy-duty shelving. They\u2019re the industry go-to! For one, they\u2019re customizable for kitchens of pretty much any size. I know I said my boyfriend\u2019s were huge, but it\u2019s really a choose-your-own-adventure approach to shelving. They come in a range of widths, depths, heights, finishes, and installations\u2014freestanding, wall-mounted, or on wheels! Too many roommates in the kitchen? Roll the shelves over to your \u201cliving-room-office\u201d to make space.Oh, and those shelves? Well, they can be positioned at any spot along the posts for maximum versatility, so you aren\u2019t stuck with that one tall appliance you just can\u2019t find a space for. Plus, each of them can hold A LOT. Like anywhere from 250\u2013800 pounds a lot. (See! I was not exaggerating. Tanks!) At a coffee shop where I used to work, we didn\u2019t think twice about the 45-pound Cambros of iced coffee we threw onto them to brew overnight, or the heavy bags of beans we stored for use during the morning rush. They withstand it all.\u00a0If you\u2019re getting tired of gross little bottle rings left behind by sticky oyster sauce and sesame oil, have no fear. Metro shelves are also easy to clean. You can simply take a wet towel to them without worrying about damaging wood or veneer. They\u2019re finished with a coating called Microban, which keeps the surface from getting covered in bacteria, mold, mildew, and all that other nasty stuff.But they\u2019re not just for kitchens, either. They end up on construction sites, at hospitals, and in labs, so you can bet I use these elsewhere in my house too. (They\u2019ve served my camping gear well in the garage.)\u00a0As a longtime member of the F&B industry, these shelves are near and dear to my heart. As a person with quite a lot of stuff, I know there\u2019s no better storage solution than to just Metro Shelf\u2013it.Metro 18\" x 24\" x 74\" 5 Shelf Unit$215 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendShoppingRecipes you want to make.
