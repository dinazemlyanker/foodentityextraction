Here\u2019s why.\u00a0By Alex BeggsOctober 16, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Susie Theodorou, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiFacebookTwitterEmailWe asked our food editors to test and retest the Thanksgiving classics: to compare Idaho potatoes to German Butterballs, to weigh the merits of whole birds against cooking in parts. And we asked them to do it while filming Making Perfect, a six-part video series documenting every success and setback. Somehow, it all worked out...perfectly. Here\u2019s how Expertly Spiced and Glazed Roast Turkey came together.Find all of the recipes from the Absolutely, Positively Perfect Thanksgiving menu here.The Dream TeamAndy Baraghani and Brad LeoneThe ChallengeMiraculously roast a turkey that is well seasoned, juicy, and\u2014can we type this loudly enough?\u2014PROPERLY COOKED! Every part of the bird deserves equal love and appreciation, without a dry bite in the house.The SolutionThe absolute inarguably best way to cook a turkey is to break it down into parts, dry-brine it, and roast it on a wire rack in a baking sheet.Watch Andy and Brad on their quest to make the perfect Thanksgiving turkey and cranberry sauce.\nWhy Aren't We Cooking Our Turkey Whole?You can get a near-perfect turkey roasted whole\u2014we\u2019ve done that in the past\u2014but being able to guarantee both thighs and breasts are succulent? Parts make it happen, exposing every piece for even cooking. If the idea of doing surgery on a raw turkey gives you a stress rash, ask the butcher to do it (even at the supermarket, we called and asked!). Here\u2019s your script: \u201cHello, talented and smart and under appreciated butcher [pause for uncomfortable laughter], I\u2019d like to purchase a 12-to-14-pound turkey, cut into five pieces: the legs, wings, keep the breast whole, backbone removed. Yes, I\u2019m doing that ridiculous Bon Appe\u0301tit recipe. Yes, it better not suck.\u201d Works every time.This Year Break Out the Baking SheetHigh-sided roasting pans keep the heat from directly hitting the turkey, causing some areas to brown more than others and increasing cook time. So we followed a trick that food stylists use for a beautifully browned bird by roasting on a wire rack set inside a baking sheet, which lets air circulate underneath for that crucial crispy skin.The proper layout\nPhoto by Alex LauFace Off: Dry Brine vs. Wet BrineThe salt in the dry brine (a.k.a. rub) has two effects. First off, it is abundant, which properly seasons the turkey and banishes the blandness. Second, the overnight uncovered chill helps dry out the skin, allowing it to crisp when roasted. When you use a wet brine, it\u2019s difficult to fully dry the turkey afterward, dampening your crispy-skin dreams. Plus, drawing a turkey bath in a huge cooler is a messy nightmare and zero fun to clean. Dry brine for life.The Ingredient: Pink PeppercornBrad advocated (bradvocated) for pink peppercorns in the rub, which are pleasantly pink, floral and fruity, and offer a little something different. If you don\u2019t have them, that\u2019s fine, there\u2019s still black peppercorn as well.The Turkey\u2019s Lip-Smacking Glaze...has soy sauce, light brown sugar, sherry vinegar, hardy herbs, orange peel, and garlic, and gives the turkey that high-gloss runway look.See all that crispy skin and succulent meat?\nPhoto by Emma FishmanDrop It While It\u2019s HotThe oven starts at 425 and immediately cranks down, which creates a nice golden color on the turkey skin without drying out the meat.How to Take the Turkey\u2019s TemperatureEach piece has an ideal temp: Look for 150\u00b0 for white meat and 170\u00b0 for dark. Start with the thickest part of the thigh, directing the thermometer down. Then get into the center of the breast by inserting the tip of the thermometer horizontally from the neck end, aiming for the meatiest part of the breast. Then go in from the side to double-check. Make sure you\u2019re hitting meat not bone.Shoppin\u2019 TurkeyShow you\u2019re thankful for the farmers who treat their turkeys well. Certified Humane and Animal Welfare Approved (look for those trademarks on the label) hold the highest standards for the treatment of animals, so we especially seek those out.Get the recipe:Expertly Spiced and Glazed Roast TurkeyThe absolute inarguably best way to cook a well-seasoned, juicy turkey is to break it down into parts, dry-brine it, and roast it on a wire rack in a baking sheet.View RecipeFor more Absolutely, Positively Perfect Thanksgiving menu ideas:1 / 8ChevronChevronExpertly Spiced and Glazed Roast TurkeyView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titThanksgivingMaking Perfect: ThanksgivingRead MorerecipesBon App\u00e9tit\u2019s Absolutely, Positively Perfect Thanksgiving MenuGallery8 SlidesBy The Bon App\u00e9tit Test KitchenRecipes you want to make.
