When something's so easy to make that you don't even need one. Welcome to It's That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.As someone who has, in recent times, gotten a little too comfortable with a slow morning, a hot, comforting breakfast is pretty much a given for me. But with this newfound commitment comes an evergreen dilemma: sweet or savory? On days when I can\u2019t for the life of me decide between a cheesy omelet and a syrupy pancake, I opt for my Polish grandma\u2019s solution: a lil\u2019 bit of both.\u201cBabcia\u2019s Omelet\u201d is essentially an egg-forward pancake (or a doughy omelet), laced with cheese and smothered in jam. The thing itself refuses to be labeled, which I think is very progressive, and the texture sits squarely between French toast and sponge cake. Only it\u2019s savory. And it\u2019s also sweet. Listen, the cakelet is simply transcendent.To make a cakelet, start by whisking together 2 large eggs. You want to get them to a point where there are no translucent whites bobbing around\u2014they need to be totally combined. Add 2 Tbsp. self-rising flour (or 2 Tbsp. all-purpose flour and \u00bc tsp. baking powder), a pinch of salt, and \u00bc cup of grated cheese to the egg scramble. When it comes to cheese, my grandma swears by Swiss. I think a more zealous cheddar plays nice with the sweet jam, but even shredded Babybels will do if you\u2019re in a bind. If you are going for a sharper cheese, though, make sure to omit the salt. Use a fork to whisk everything into a kind of loose batter.Place a smallish (ideally 8\") skillet over a medium-hot stove. You want your frying pan to be about the size of a small side plate, as the batter is going to fill the space. (If your pan is too big, you\u2019ll end up with something like a sad, overcooked crepe.) Melt 1\u20132 Tbsp. of unsalted butter in the pan, swirl it to dispere, then pour in the batter. Once you see tiny bubbles forming on the surface, like a pancake, flip the cakelet and cook for another couple of minutes. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s done once it\u2019s risen to double the size, both sides are golden, and it springs back when you poke the top.Photo and Food Styling by Laura MurrayTransfer to a plate and finish the cakelet with a liberal slather of raspberry or apricot jam, or, if you really want to lean savory, a swoop of hummus with some thick sliced tomato and lots of cracked pepper.Whichever direction you choose, the eating experience is both curious and delightful: springy, bready, and cheesy. And once you\u2019ve made it a couple of times, you\u2019ll never have to struggle through the omelet versus pancake debate again.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimplePancakeOmeletJamCheeseRecipes you want to make.
