Here, Orlando and his dedicated team serve push-all-the-envelopes food with a mission to generate 75 percent less waste: kale stems flavor a hollandaise, burnt wood infuses oil, and leftover potato peels are worked into crisps.THE VIBE IS: warehouse-y\u2014concrete walls and columns, widely spaced tables, graffiti as art\u2014with polished moments. (Despite the hip-hop and spray paint, the team takes itself very seriously.) Swing by in summer when the industrial room opens to the outside and nightly bonfires are lit near the raised garden bed.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open for dinner Tuesday to Saturday, from 6 p.m. to midnight and lunch Friday and Saturday, from noon to 3:30 p.m. (last seating at 1 p.m.). Closed Sunday and Monday. Make sure your phone is charged before dinner: There\u2019s no way you\u2019re hailing a cab back to the hotel in this neck of the woods, so call for an Uber.\u2014Christine MuhlkePhoto by Ditte IsagerWE ALSO LOVENomaThe next evolution of Ren\u00e9 Redzepi\u2019s destination restaurant in Refshale\u00f8enRel\u00e6Live a little with the N\u00f8rrebro tasting-menu restaurant that\u2019s still making waves La BanchinaGet real R&R in at this Amager Harbor vegetable-focused restaurant with a few surprisesExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
