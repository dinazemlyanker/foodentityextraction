You\u2019re exploring the murky depths of your messy-ass fridge, sifting through treats and terrors in hopes of finding some suitable dinner material, when it appears: A hunk of cheese sporting a definitely-not-there-when-you-bought-it polka-dot coat of fuzzy mold. And then the bargaining begins. Moldy cheese, like all other moldy foods, should go in the garbage, you think to yourself quite reasonably. But then: Maybe that\u2019s...okay? Like, blue cheese has mold on it, and that\u2019s okay to eat, right? Can\u2019t I just cut the gross-looking stuff off? Around and around we go, the menu for the evening oscillating between cheesy pasta\u2014delicious, but maybe...deadly?\u2014and some tired canned-bean business. This is exactly the kind of high-stakes negotiation that exactly no one has bandwidth for on a Tuesday night.Enough! No more! There are answers to this whole is-moldy-cheese-safe business, and we must have them! We talked to Rich Morillo, a certified cheese professional (that\u2019s a thing!) and the cheese operations manager (also a great title!) for Di Bruno Bros., Philadelphia's O.G. cheese shop\u2014to find out what the deal is with moldy cheese and whether it belongs in the trash can or a baking dish. The answers? Kind of surprising, TBH.The first thing you\u2019ve got to understand is that, by and large, microorganisms like mold are what makes cheese, well, cheese. \u201cIn a lot of ways, cheese is mold,\u201d explains Morillo. With the notable exception of fresh cheeses that are meant to be consumed shortly after they are made (mozzarella, ricotta, queso fresco, etc.), most cheeses owe their distinct deliciousness and texture to the microbiological alchemy that occurs when mold, bacteria, and other microorganisms feast on the proteins and sugars present in milk, transforming them into a wide range of flavorful compounds. (Science is cool!)And while this whole cheese-is-mold business might be pretty obvious when you\u2019re staring down a blue-veined hunk of stinky Stilton, you\u2019ve also probably seen it\u2014and eaten it\u2014without even knowing it. You know that thick white rind on the outside of a wheel of brie? That\u2019s mold, people! (Penicillium candidum to be more precise.) \u201cBrie starts off looking like a disc of fresh cheese, then grows a whole lot of fuzzy white mold,\u201d describes Morillo. \u201cThey call it \u2018cat\u2019s fur,\u2019 and the cheesemaker literally pats all the mold down, flips the cheese over, and lets the process repeat.\u201d The result is the savory, mushroomy white rind that makes brie and other so-called \u201cbloomy rind\u201d cheeses delicious but also different from all other cheeses.That white rind is MOLD! And it is DELICIOUS!\nAlex LauIn a lot of ways, the job of the cheesemaker and the cheesemonger is mold maintenance\u2014making sure the right kind of mold is growing in the right place at the right time and intervening when necessary. \u201cYou\u2019re babysitting and letting nature do its work,\u201d Morillo says. \u201cIn the shop, one of the first things we do in the morning is check on the cheese and see if any mold has grown over the course of the night. We want the cheese to look nice for the customers, and a lot of people are squeamish around mold, so if we see a fluffy column of mold or a few specs of blue growing on the cut side of a wedge of cheese, we slice or scrape it off.\u201dAccording to Morillo, it\u2019s pretty rare that you\u2019ll find mold growing on cheese that actually presents a health concern. With the exception of a few types that are actually quite rare to find on cheese, such as the dark black-gray mold Aspergillus niger, most mold isn\u2019t going to hurt you at all. But that doesn\u2019t mean that you want to eat it necessarily. Just as the molds that are a part of the cheesemaking process are integral to the flavor and texture of the finished cheese, the mold that might grow all over that chunk of cheddar you forgot about in the back of the fridge might compromise it; whether or not it tastes bad to you, the mold-affected part of that cheese isn\u2019t going to taste the way it was meant to taste necessarily. If the cheesemaker and cheesemonger are meticulous mold babysitters, you, cheese-in-the-back-of-the-fridge-forgetter, are the irresponsible teen told to stay home with your younger sister to make sure she doesn\u2019t get electrocuted\u2014you\u2019re not doing irreparable damage, but you\u2019re probably not helping things all that much, either.Just cut it off! Everything is going to be FINE!\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Anna BillingskogSo what to do about that pesky, maybe-less-than-yummy mold growing on the cheese in your fridge? Well, most of the time you can simply cut it off and go on living your life. Mac 'n' cheese it up. Grilled cheese yourself. Whatevs. How much you have to cut off has to do with what kind of cheese you\u2019re working with. Like mushrooms and other fungi, mold grows roots kind of like a houseplant\u2014the fuzzy stuff you see growing on the exterior might have little tendrils that go down deep. How far those mold roots are able to penetrate depends on how dry or moist your cheese is. Microorganisms thrive in wet environments and are less active in dry ones, which means that, for the most part, mold roots will barely be able to penetrate the surface of a hard, salty cheese like Parmesan or a crumbly, long-aged cheddar but will be able to get deeper into a semisoft cheese like, say, Havarti or a mild cheddar. And as for extremely wet, fresh cheeses like mozzarella, ricotta, cream cheese, or ch\u00e8vre, Morillo recommends pitching them if you see visible mold\u2014again, not going to kill you, but the mold will most definitely have changed the flavor of the cheese, and probably not in a good way.Okay, let\u2019s recap. Mold is an integral part of the cheesemaking process. Almost none of it will kill you, but it could negatively impact the flavor and texture of the cheese it\u2019s growing on or at the very least make it taste pretty different from how it was supposed to. Most of the time, if you see some mold, you can just cut it off\u2014about an inch around and below the mold spot, if you want to be really rigorous about it\u2014especially if you\u2019re working with a harder cheese. Still grossed out? Throw it out. That\u2019s what Morillo tells customers who seem especially skeptical of the whole cutting-mold-off-of-cheese thing. \u201cIf you think the mold is going to make you feel some type of way, well, it probably will.\u201dWhat\u2019re you waiting for?
