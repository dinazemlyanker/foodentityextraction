Thinly slice shallots crosswise into rings on a mandoline (they should be about the thickness of a dime).Step 2Place shallots in a medium saucepan and pour in oil to submerge. Set over medium-low heat and cook, stirring often with a fork to encourage rings to separate, until shallots are golden brown, 20\u201325 minutes. (Keep an eye on them; once they start to brown they\u2019ll darken fast.)Step 3Pour shallots into strainer to drain, then transfer to paper towels. Season with salt and let cool. Reserve shallot oil for another use, like vinaigrettes, stir-fries, and soups.Step 4Do Ahead: Shallots can be fried 5 days ahead.

Next time, I'll go for a tad thicker.  At the recommended dime thickness, it took about 35 minutes to get the shallots to golden brown. At the 25 minute mark, I cranked up the heat to nearly medium high.  When I first started the process, the rings all blobbed together so I was concerned they'd finish up that way.  Not to worry.  At about the 30-minute mark, you could definitely see the shallot rings separating from each other and gaining some individual personality.  ;)  The last five minutes was when they needed the most attention and a watchful eye.  Kind of messy but worth the effort.  These are very tasty!Nana BananaVenice, CA11/24/2021Omg! Now I see why these are so hot, I added 5 cloves of garlic and some sichuan peppercorns. Hope I can save some for the noodles!David ParackaLittle Falls NY2/7/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titCondimentShallotVegetableDairy-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreeVeganVegetarianFryRecipes you want to make.
