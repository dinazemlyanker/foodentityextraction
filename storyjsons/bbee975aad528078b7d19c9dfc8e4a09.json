Here\u2019s how to make crisp, crunchy, cumin-coated morsels of cauliflower and potato.By Priya KrishnaJune 10, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesFacebookTwitterEmailI\u2019ve noticed that aloo gobi is the one Indian dish (aside from butter chicken and anything that\u2019s labeled \u201ctikka masala,\u201d which...don\u2019t get me started) that even people who don\u2019t know much about Indian food have heard of.They\u2019ve eaten it at an Indian restaurant, or at a wedding. It\u2019s the dish in the seminal romantic comedy Bend it Like Beckham that Jasminder\u2019s mother wants her to learn to make instead of playing soccer (they\u2019re not mutually exclusive activities, Aunty!!).But from my experience, aloo gobi, which is potatoes (aloo) and cauliflower (gobi) saut\u00e9ed in onions, turmeric, and a few other spices, can be a soggy, bland letdown.Where things go wrong is in the preparation of the vegetables. There are two traditional ways of making aloo gobi: deep fry the potatoes and cauliflower before saut\u00e9ing them in the seasonings, which often yields a greasy mess. Or saut\u00e9 everything in one pan, which can result in mush.But as she always does, my mom came up with a method that solves these mushy, greasy problems: ROASTING.Priya makes aloo gobi.\nShe roasts the cauliflower florets and sliced potatoes in a 425 degree oven for about 30 minutes, tossing halfway through. You\u2019re looking for them to crisp up and char at the edges, so they won\u2019t get soggy once they hit the pan. Because you\u2019ve pre-roasted the cauliflower and potatoes, all you need to do now is quickly toss them with the spices. (Important: Don\u2019t forget about the charred, burn-y bits in the pan! Those are the best!). The mush and grease problems are solved. You\u2019re left with crisp, crunchy, cumin-coated morsels that dazzle with brightness and are also hearty and nourishing. Salt, lime juice, and chopped cilantro finish it off.The other trick to my mom\u2019s aloo gobi is the whole cumin seeds. Perhaps you are nervous about cooking with whole spices, and are used to seeing cumin in its ground form. Let me tell you a few things about cumin seeds! They: (1) are less work, because you don\u2019t have to grind anything, (2) are more aromatic than the pre-ground stuff, which has probably been sitting on a shelf for a while (3) have a smokier, more complex flavor than ground cumin and (4) add crunch and interest to a dish that might otherwise feel too homogeneous.And if you love a good make-ahead, my mom\u2019s move is to pre-roast the potatoes and cauliflower and then pop them in the fridge until she\u2019s ready to cook. Then, just toss the veggies in the pan with the seasonings, and the dish is ready in 15 minutes.When done right, roasted aloo gobi is straightforward to make but hard to forget: the potatoes and the cauliflower are slightly soft, with this beautiful salt and spice crust. You can taste the inherent flavor of the vegetables, accented by acid and char. Every bite is a little different\u2014you might get a tater tot-like potato piece in one, a lime-soaked piece of ginger in another.Aloo gobi is the embodiment of what makes Indian home cooking so special to me. It\u2019s the idea that with a short amount of time and a few spices, anyone can make a dish that tastes this complex.Get the recipe:Roasted Aloo Gobi (Potatoes and Cauliflower)This classic (and familiar) potato-and-cauliflower dish is a great make-ahead party dish.View RecipePriya Krishna\u2019s cookbook Indian-ish, documenting her journey of learning to make the distinct, hybridized cuisine of her chic, extremely skilled-in-the-kitchen mom, Ritu, is now out from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt!
