One country whose cuisine is often ignored by the Western mainstream is Cambodia, a sliver of land nestled between Thailand and Vietnam with its own deep vibrant cuisine that was almost lost to genocide in the 1970s.\u201cI think Cambodian food is underrepresented because of Cambodia\u2019s history,\u201d says chef Chinchakriya Un, founder of Brooklyn pop-up restaurant Kreung Cambodia. \u201cI stepped away from the Cambodian diet for a long time living in New York until I finally learned how to cook it myself with the help of my family.\u201d Through her work, Un is dedicated to preserving and expanding her Cambodian culinary heritage and passing the knowledge down to future generations. One of Un\u2019s most beloved staples of Cambodian cuisine is tuk trey ping poh, a sour-salty-spicy sauce with so many uses that you\u2019ll want to make a big batch to keep on hand.Photo by Emma Fishman, Food Styling by Susie Theodorou, Prop Styling by Elizabeth JaimeWhat is tuk trey ping poh?Tuk trey is Khmer for \u201cfish sauce,\u201d while ping poh translates to \u201ctomato,\u201d so there are really no secrets to the sauce. Sweet, juicy tomatoes are roasted with shallots, garlic, and green Thai chiles until they\u2019re blistered and ready to burst. The charred vegetables are food-processed into a coarse paste, then splashed with lime juice, seasoned with sugar and fish sauce, and sprinkled with fresh cilantro. The result is a tangy, umami-rich, spicy tomato sauce that is delicious on just about anything. \u201cIt's like our marinara or our salsa,\u201d Un says. \u201cIt\u2019s so good that I kind of just want it on everything.\u201dHow can you use tuk trey ping poh?Tuk trey ping poh can be used in a variety of ways: as a marinade for grilled fish, a flavor booster for a pot of beans, a dipping sauce for crudit\u00e9s, a sauce for meat, and can even be reduced into a starter for soups and stews. Un herself recommends using tuk trey ping poh to coat roasted potatoes, as a spread on fried chicken sandwiches, and even as a relish for a hot dog. \u201cYou can apply it anywhere you would use some type of tomatoey jam,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are a lot of applications.\u201dAre there any variations on tuk trey ping poh?If you find yourself with watery, out of season tomatoes, Un suggests making a twist on classic tuk trey ping poh by swapping out fish sauce for shrimp paste, which adds its own salty sweetness to the sauce. And since tuk trey ping poh is fundamentally simple, Un also loves to experiment with it by swapping out traditional ingredients for seasonal produce and things she can find easily at local markets. \u201cI\u2019ve made it with tomatillos because I\u2019ve lived in pretty predominantly Latinx neighborhoods and they\u2019re just around,\u201d she says. \u201cI also did it with blueberries one season! It was so good. As long as there\u2019s some type of fruit or nightshade vegetable that you feel good about smashing and roasting, you can actually adapt this dish in so many ways.\u201dGet the recipe:Tuk Trey Ping Poh With Pork ChopsTangy, spicy, and herbaceous, tuk trey ping poh is a versatile Khmer condiment that\u2019s great served with any protein and as a dipping sauce and a base for soups and curries.
