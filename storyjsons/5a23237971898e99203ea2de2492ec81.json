We got you covered.By Hilary CadiganNovember 19, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailPicture this: It\u2019s Thanksgiving. You\u2019re wearing an unflatteringly large sweater and stretch pants. You\u2019re with your family\u2014the extended version, including that great-aunt with \u201dinteresting\u201c politics and your cousin\u2019s girlfriend whose name no one can remember. There\u2019s a turkey in the oven (hopefully Andy Baraghani\u2019s dry-brined glazey guy), a scary-looking centerpiece made of dead branches your sister foraged from the yard, and a whole mess of sides at varying levels of doneness vying for counter space. Your brother just brought up the Midterm results. What do you need most right now? You need a drink.This is the mental image I\u2019m conjuring in my office at 4 p.m. on the Friday before Thanksgiving. I\u2019m practicing for the Big Day in the Test Kitchen with Molly Baz, inventor of Thanksgiving 2018\u2019s official It-Drink: the Fall Spritz. It tastes complex, but making it is even simpler than last year's Thanksgiving\u2019s punch: Six ounces of Basque-style dry hard cider (I opted for Barrika, but Isastegi Sagardo is a good option too) plus 1.5 ounces of amaro (Averna if you have it, but just about anything will work), poured over ice and finished with a twist of orange peel. That\u2019s it.\u201cSee, I\u2019m not trying to stop drinking Aperol spritzes just because summer is over,\u201d says Molly. \u201cThis carries the spritz right on over into fall.\u201dBecause it\u2019s 4 p.m. on a Friday in the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen, several other staffers are milling about. I make the drink for all of them, portioning it into large white wine glasses filled to the top with ice cubes (the more the better; you want this baby frosty, and a slight watering down by the ice as it melts is a good thing).The key here is the magic ratio: four parts cider to one part amaro. You could measure, or you could just eyeball it. Really, says Molly, it doesn\u2019t even matter what type of amaro you use; just go for whatever you have on hand. Aiming for a \u201cmedium\u201d option that balances bitter, sweet, and citrus will work particularly well against the dry tang of the cider\u2014we tried Meletti and felt quite positive about the results. Remember, you\u2019re using Basque-style cider here, which means there\u2019s barely even a hint of sweetness coming from the apples. Just funky tartness, nice and cloudy and unfiltered. Combined with the amaro\u2019s herbaceousness and the fragrance of the fresh orange peel, the result is a fresh, floral, light-bodied sipper that\u2019s not too boozy to double (or triple, or quadruple) up on.Don\u2019t skip the orange peel!\nPhoto by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen Kaminski\u201cThere\u2019s funk for the millennials and bright clean flavor for the moms,\u201d says associate social media manager Emily Schultz, sidling up to the table with glass in hand.\u201cYeah, and you could drink it forever,\u201d says digital restaurant editor Elyse Inamine between slugs. \u201cI feel like this is perfect for when you\u2019re stuck at the table because your uncle is telling a really long story.\u201dAssociate editor Christina Chaey joins the party. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have a cocktail that feels composed without having to do much work,\u201d she says, with gravitas. \u201cIn fact, this is a cocktail you could make without owning a single bar tool.\u201dShe\u2019s right: The easiness of this cocktail is hard to overstate. Which works just as well if you\u2019re playing guest, and not host, this Thanksgiving. You could pop by the liquor store on your way to dinner, grab a bottle of amaro, a few bottles of cider, and an orange, and arrive looking not like the deadbeat who didn\u2019t cook anything and never does (\ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb), but a hero with a very sophisticated palate. Just put the bottles on the table, bust out some glasses and an ice bucket, and let everyone fend for themselves. Because it\u2019s spritz-o\u2019clock, and that\u2019s always something to be thankful for.Get the recipe:Fall SpritzNo more punch bowls, big-batching, or complicated mixology.
