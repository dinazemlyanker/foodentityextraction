Well, not physically. You\u2019ll have to make it. We were reminiscing recently about a fat slice of diner apple pie, served with a drooping square of cheese on top that doesn\u2019t quite cover the crust, like a throw blanket on a king-sized bed. How could we recreate that savory-cheesy-sweet idea and transform it into something new and thrilling? Molly Baz was up to the challenge. Her recipe scatters finely grated sharp cheddar in the buttery crust, amps up the spices in the apples, and is served with a chunk of cheese \u00e0 la mode. I don\u2019t speak French but I think that checks out.Let\u2019s break it down in three parts.Part I: The Apple Filling\u201cI don\u2019t want to say...Yankee Candle\u2026\u201d Molly begins to tell me in a hush, \u201cbut the spices in the pie are very fragrant. If it were [a candle! shh!], it\u2019d be called \u2018Christmas by the Fireplace\u2019 or some sh*t like that.\u201d (Would purchase in every size, including the little car fresheners.) There\u2019s a heaping load of cloves, cinnamon, and allspice in the apple mixture to balance the savory cheddar crust. A splash of whiskey in there really brings the fireplace, if ya know what I mean.That cheesy crust tho.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensAnd get this: You mix the apple filling in a plastic bag, like a piece of meat you\u2019re going to throw on the grill later. The recipe asks to let the mixture sit for at least an hour, or even overnight (which should be fine if you use hard apples like Grannies). The marinade sucks the moisture out of the apples, which sounds dry and weird but in fact what we\u2019re preventing is a dry pie filling. You\u2019ll put a bag of apples in the fridge and wake up with a bag of apples and all this liquid. Sweet. Then you mix the apples and all those eked-out juices with brown butter and cornstarch, and it thickens together in the oven.Part II: The Cheesy CrustWhy isn\u2019t there cheese in the filling, like other recipes for apple-cheddar pie online? \u201cThe filling is sugary and spiced,\u201d Molly explains, \u201ccheese melting in there would give it this mac and cheese quality that we didn\u2019t want. We want pie.\u201d Yes, we do. By incorporating the cheese into the crust, you \u201creally get to experience the cheese,\u201d which might be one of the most beautiful things Molly has ever said. It reminded us of our sacred cheese twist recipe, a buttery flaky cracker you never want to stop eating. There\u2019s also a dash of whiskey in the crust, which takes the place of vodka (you could also use apple cider vin), as booze evaporates faster than water = maximum flake factor. You don\u2019t taste it at all. Well, unless you pour some for yourself on the side.TJ\u2019s English cheddar would be a good cheese-fit for this pie.\nAlex LauPart III: Cheese \u00e0 la ModeThe cheese we use throughout is Grafton Village\u2019s 2-year cheddar, and that\u2019s what you see served on the side like a stray roof shingle (mmm roof cheese) up top. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time for that expensive 7-year Gouda,\u201d Molly advises, as it\u2019s too potent to complement the sugary apples. The final cheese chunk on the side plays up the sweet and savory even more, and it\u2019s a fun way to serve pie, so of all the things in this recipe you could skip (the overnight marinade, the whiskey, okay), don\u2019t skip this one!Get the recipe:Apple-Cheddar PieA slice of apple pie with a slab of sharp cheddar on it is one of life\u2019s great gastronomical treasures.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPieAppleapple pieDessertFallCheeseRecipes you want to make.
