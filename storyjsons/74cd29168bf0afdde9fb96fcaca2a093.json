An even higher temp chars the leeks so that they\u2019re smoky outside and sweet and juicy inside.Ingredients4 servings4medium leeks (about 2\u00bd lb.)1cup green olives\u00bccup coarsely chopped dill3Tbsp. white wine vinegarKosher salt5Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more3oranges41\"-thick swordfish steaks (about 3 lb.)Freshly ground black pepperPreparationStep 1Prepare a grill for high heat. Trim dark green parts from leeks and remove any tough outer layers. Rinse off any sand and dirt and pat dry.Step 2Throw leeks on grill (no oil needed) and grill, turning every few minutes with tongs, until outside layer is completely blackened (they should start to soften and you might see some juices begin to ooze out), 10\u201312 minutes. Transfer to a platter and let cool (this also allows them to steam and become tender on the inside). Reduce grill heat to medium-high.Step 3Meanwhile, smash open olives using the side of a chef\u2019s knife and remove pits (try to leave olive flesh in big pieces). Transfer to a medium bowl.Step 4Cut leeks into \u00bd\"-thick rounds (ashy parts and all) and add to bowl with olives along with dill, vinegar, a big pinch of salt, and 3 Tbsp. oil; toss to combine.Step 5Slice off both ends of oranges, exposing the flesh beneath the pith, then stand an orange upright on a cut side like this:Illustration by Joe WilsonStep 6Following the natural curve of orange, slice away peel and white pith from top to bottom.Illustration by Joe WilsonStep 7Trim off any remaining bits of pith, then lay orange on its side and cut crosswise into \u00bc\"-thick rounds. Set aside for serving.Illustration by Joe WilsonStep 8Clean and oil grate and rub swordfish steaks with 2 Tbsp. oil; season with salt. Grill until lightly charred and just cooked through (fish will feel firm when gently pressed), 5\u20137 minutes per side.Step 9Divide swordfish among plates and arrange reserved sliced oranges around. Spoon leek mixture and any juices in bowl over. Drizzle with more oil and season with pepper.How would you rate Grilled Swordfish with Charred Leeks and Citrus?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkExplore Bon App\u00e9titSwordfishFishSeafoodLeekVegetableOrangeCitrusFruitOliveOther IngredientsEasyWeeknight MealsMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreeHealthyishGrillingDinnerRecipes you want to make.
