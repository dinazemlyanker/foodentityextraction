Opened in 1914 in Providence, Rhode Island, in a former mansion on Federal Hill, the city\u2019s Little Italy, it\u2019s one of the oldest restaurants in town. It\u2019s also one of Providence\u2019s most iconic, known for its permanent menu of gnocchi alla vodka and veal Parmesan; rumored mob connections; and celebrity sightings\u2014politicians, power players, Frank Sinatra, Diana Ross. Kilborn, a soft-spoken restaurant careerist who\u2019s been running the front-of-house here for nearly two decades, oversees it all. We tagged along with him on one of the liveliest nights of the week as he worked the room.6:15 p.m.\u201cGeorgie!\u201dAn older woman with a dyed brunette bob and a red cardigan lined in sequins emerges from the restroom. Kilborn gives her a hug as she makes her way to the lounge.\u201cShe\u2019s still coming in?\u201d whispers John Conti, a ma\u00eetre d\u2019. Margie Bajakian is 85.\u201cEvery Friday,\u201d Kilborn says. \u201cShe missed two weeks and we were worried, but it was just because she had a cold.\u201dMargie settles herself into a seat at the corner of the long dark wood bar, where a statue of a busty woman in a low-cut red dress presides over the liquor selection. She orders the zuppa di cozze, a wide, flat bowl of soup filled with mussels, lardons, caramelized onions, and roasted garlic. \u201cI don\u2019t like to get the fattening stuff,\u201d she says.She started coming to Camille\u2019s in the 1970s but stopped when she got married and had kids. About five years ago, she picked the habit back up again. It became crucial, she explains, especially after the loss of her son.\u201cEveryone said, \u2018Your son died, why are you going out?\u2019 And I says, \u2018It\u2019s because I can\u2019t take it if I stay home.\u2019 I was so depressed,\u201d she explains. \u201cThey were so good to me. George is so nice. John is so nice. I love everyone here.\u201dGeorge Kilborn Jr. ready to greet guests at his station.\nPhoto by Joe St. Pierre6:45 p.m.A middle-aged woman sits at a four-top covered in a crisp white tablecloth with her two teenage daughters. Rhiannon Tronzo is finishing her gnocchi with a pink vodka sauce. Just two weeks earlier she had come here with friends and family to celebrate her 16th birthday.\u201cIt felt like we were walking onto a movie set,\u201d she says, gesturing around the windowless dining room decorated with mirrors and bright glass sculptures. Until about 20 years ago, small booths lined the walls, each with thick curtains to make them private.\u201cDeals were made in those alcoves,\u201d Kilborn says.Angela and Angelo Ruo (\u201cYes, those are really our names\u201d), Camille\u2019s regulars of 25 years, remember other details: \u201cFriday nights were for girlfriends, and Saturdays were for wives.\u201dCamille\u2019s, set in the same former mansion since 1914.\nPhoto by Joe St. Pierre7:30 p.m.Down the hall, the coat check begins to fill up. At the door sits Cynthia Henley, a woman in a fuchsia dress who has worked at Camille\u2019s for 34 years. \u201cI was the first person of color in the front-of-house in all of Federal Hill,\u201d she says. \u201cThere still aren\u2019t many people of color in the front-of-house.\u201d She was hired because the woman who had the job before her gave away a mink coat by mistake. \u201cIt was a long time ago, and it really was almost shocking for the guests to come in and see a person of color. They couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201dAs guests shed their layers, Kilborn eyes a woman wearing leopard-print athletic leggings, a matching leopard-print sweatshirt, and leopard-print heels festooned with pink pom-poms. Guests used to dress up to come to Camille\u2019s, he remembers. The restaurant was an occasion spot. It was considered elegant, fancy, and with a dress code to match. But that\u2019s all changed. \u201cWe do still ask them to take off their hats,\u201d he says, and sighs.9 p.m.All reservations have been seated, and the eight-piece Down City Band eases into its set in the lounge. The room\u2014a bar, white leather booths, and an open space for dancing\u2014is practically vibrating. Guests, most over the age of 40, stream in through the front door and go straight for the bar. A woman in a red strapless dress and fur coat hands Kilborn a large bottle of gin (\u201cshe\u2019s a liquor rep,\u201d he explains) and heads in to dance.Clockwise from top left: Prosciutto-wrapped halibut, fried calamari, and shrimp in Sambuca-butter sauce.\nPhoto by Joe St. Pierre10:30 p.m.Kilborn and ma\u00eetre d\u2019 Conti sit down at the two-top closest to the entrance and order dinner as they do every Friday. Kilborn eats shrimp cocktail and grilled salmon over vegetable risotto. \u201cSometimes I try to be good,\u201d he says.\u201cI grew up down the street,\u201d Conti says over his beet salad and veal Parm. \u201cThis was my favorite restaurant to go to with my friends. I got engaged here. My son\u2019s communion celebration was here. When my father passed, we came here. It\u2019s near and dear. I\u2019ve known everyone for years.\u201dKilborn faces the kitchen, Conti the dining room. They both have a clear view of the door, just in case.12 a.m.The band plays its last song. The lights come up. The guests trickle out. Kilborn restocks the wine closet and makes his final rounds. After a lap around the dining room, he heads home, the restaurant properly put to bed.Molly Birnbaum is a writer based in Providence, Rhode Island, and editor in chief of America's Test Kitchen Kids.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsItalian AmericanRed SauceRhode IslandRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
