But...jam? Yep. This month, Bonne Maman released a new line of \u201cintense\u201d fruit spreads in the U.S. This is the company\u2019s French recipe and it\u2019s slightly less sweet (39 percent, to be exact), and more fruit-forward. How does it compare to the classic 23 flavors? We were the first to taste the three debut flavors and find out.The differences between the original and the new line are subtle. The original, red gingham-printed lid Bonne Maman jar is 13 oz. with 50 percent fruit, while the smaller, purple-topped 8.2 oz. Intense jar is 67 percent fruit. A jar of original apricot jam has 13g of sugar per Tbsp, while Intense has 8g per Tbsp. Bon App\u00e9tit staffers tried classic Bonne Maman and the new Intense line side-by-side and here\u2019s what we thought:Bonne Maman Intense: StrawberryAlex Lau\u201cPure strawberry flavor and not too sweet,\u201d remarked one taster, noting that the little seeds within were a nice touch, but it was a little too chunky. \u201cVery berry! Good acidity and balance\u2014I want it with yogurt, please,\u201d noted another. However, it wasn\u2019t a home run for everyone. One taster thought that the spread was too thick and that it was a bit muted compared to the original. Despite the name, the \u2018intense\u2019 is actually more mellow than the sugar-packed U.S. version, which it makes up for with a stronger fruit flavor. We\u2019re into it.Bonne Maman Intense: ApricotAlex LauSpoiler alert: Apricot won our taste test of all of Bonne Maman\u2019s flavors last year, and it ran away with that award this time too. One taster called this \u201cbest in show\u201d and described it as \u201cbeautiful flavor with fuzzy apricot skin and bursting with juice.\u201c That\u2019s poetry right there. It had the \u201cbest texture of the bunch\u201d\u2014slightly broken down pieces of fruit that were big enough to make it overall \u201cextremely fruity.\u201d It was also likened to a sun-dried apricot with a sunny, rounded flavor, and it would be perfect on ricotta toast or in thumbprint cookies. We liked this one better than the original because it wasn\u2019t as sweet or gummy.Bonne Maman Intense: BlueberryAlex LauThe original blueberry was one of the sweetest fruit spreads we\u2019d ever tasted, but the Intense version mellowed out into a looser blend of berry texture and set juices. It was bright, yet a little sour to balance things out, and one taster said it was like the \u201cperfect bite of Maine blueberry pie.\u201d It had a more seedy texture and pops of whole blueberries, making it feel kind of like fruit soup... in a good way?  It would be good in a smoothie or swirled into ice cream. When so many blueberry products taste artificial, it\u2019s nice to finally try something that tastes like real blueberries.Right now, Bonne Maman Intense is only available in Publix and Kroger stores, but it will expand to Whole Foods, Target, Amazon, and more online stores in August.Buy a six-pack of Bonne Maman Intense strawberry on Amazon for $35, or check your local grocer for a jar.Oooh, let\u2019s put some Bonne Maman Intense in icebox cake!All products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
