With coronavirus cases on the rise again in New York, the city is tightening restrictions on restaurants.Photo by Spencer Platt / Getty ImagesFacebookTwitterEmailWhen Louisville chef Edward\u00a0Lee\u00a0was forced to close the doors to his restaurants\u2014610 Magnolia, MilkWood, and Whiskey Dry in Louisville, Kentucky, as well as Succotash in Washington. D.C.\u2014due to Coronavirus, he shifted his focus to helping restaurant workers in need. His small nonprofit,\u00a0The\u00a0LEE\u00a0Initiative, launched the Restaurant Workers Relief Program, serving more than a million meals to industry employees across the country who lost their jobs or had a significant reduction in hours due to the pandemic. The nonprofit has also invested more than $800,000 in small sustainable farms among other initiatives. We talked to him about the struggles the industry faces right now, and what it\u2019s like to run a thriving nonprofit as your own businesses falter.\u00a0\u201cThis is the end of the independent restaurant era, and I don\u2019t know any chef in their right mind who feels hopeful right now. We have meal kits; we\u2019re getting tents and heaters. But at the end of the day, I\u2019m on the Titanic, trying to throw out buckets of water to stay afloat. I\u2019m fighting to save my restaurants and chefs and farmers whom we\u2019ve had relationships with for decades. But part of me is very pragmatic. We\u2019re not getting a bailout from the federal government and we\u2019re not getting leadership\u2014state, federal, even local. We\u2019ve been left to our own devices.The options for restaurants right now are to go further into debt or to close. If we make 80 percent of our income now, that\u2019s a great day. It\u2019s like a Saturday night with all the tables booked. But then there are days when we\u2019ve done 15 percent of our normal revenue. Those are days where it\u2019s actually cheaper for me to keep the lights off and close the doors.It\u2019s the fluctuations that really hurt us. We rely on patterns and predictability for inventory, for staffing, for everything. Now we don\u2019t have a clue. Some of it is COVID-related; some of it is related to the protests; and some of it related to consumer fears about eating out at restaurants. Sometimes it\u2019s just a viral article on Facebook that affects consumer confidence. 610 Magnolia has weathered recessions. Revenue-wise, last year was our best year ever. And we were on pace to beat that in 2020. There\u2019s cold comfort in knowing an entire wave of restaurants will have to close.Chef and restauranteur Edward Lee.\nPhoto by Jolea BrownI devote most of my time now to my nonprofit, The LEE Initiative and the Restaurant Workers Relief Program; it\u2019s the only thing keeping me focused, hopeful, and proud. It\u2019s very odd to have one sector of my life be incredibly successful: We\u2019ve served over a million meals to date and opened more than 30 relief kitchens around the country. Yet I\u2019m seeing the other sector of my life crumble before my eyes. It\u2019s an emotional roller coaster\u2014like watching one of your children soar while the other dies in your arms. I feel great sometimes. Then I feel guilty about feeling great. It\u2019s hard to navigate.We\u2019re trying our best to keep everyone hopeful, but at the end of the day, it feels like piling sandbags against the tsunami. For every effort we do, it just doesn\u2019t stand a chance against the economic backdrop of what restaurants are going to face this winter. And what we\u2019re seeing now is people who are basically considered middle class\u2014who\u2019ve worked their whole lives and never been on welfare\u2014are suddenly food insecure. That is a whole new demographic that didn\u2019t exist before. Some are too proud, or too ashamed, to admit that they\u2019re food insecure. These are people I know: bartenders, waiters, dishwashers, line cooks.\u00a0Unfortunately for restaurant people, our skill set doesn\u2019t translate well to other industries. We\u2019re hyper-focused on one thing: hospitality. And when the industry crumbles, you have an entire population of people not equipped to do other jobs. I\u2019ve devoted 29 years of my life to this; I can\u2019t just go sell neckties or insurance. Yet the people in power don\u2019t see that. They don\u2019t see restaurant workers as a valuable sector of our society. Their attitudes are, \u2018Well, they can go find other jobs.\u2019 That\u2019s just not the case.We\u2019re trying our best to keep everyone hopeful, but at the end of the day, it feels like piling sandbags against the tsunami.\u00a0There\u2019s a huge feeling of abandonment. You devote your life to the restaurant business, you pay your taxes, and then you realize there\u2019s no help coming from anywhere. People are suffering through a deep, deep depression. And the last thing you want in the restaurant business is for your restaurant owner, chef, GM, or waiter to be depressed, right? The whole point of the hospitality industry is for you to come to my restaurant and forget about your depression. We\u2019re the ones who supply the entertainment; our positive energy is contagious. It makes you feel great to be in a restaurant full of people who execute their jobs with passion and joy.We\u2019re not professional actors. Everyone\u2019s on the edge of emotional breakdown. It\u2019s heartbreaking to watch dedicated young men and women who\u2019ve honed a craft and made this beautiful thing we call \u2018the restaurant renaissance,\u2019 which brought pride and global attention to \u2018American cuisine\u2019 and two decades ago didn\u2019t even exist, you know\u2026making $8 cheeseburgers to-go just to make payroll.But that\u2019s where we\u2019re at. Yet you drive by the local McDonald\u2019s and there are 20 cars lined up for drive-through. It breaks your heart to see that, and to know that by the time all of the independent restaurants go away, it\u2019ll be too late. The customers will say, \u2018What a shame.\u2019 The chance to save them is right now.Old-timers like me can\u2019t pivot; I am stuck in what I\u2019m doing. But there are a lot of diverse younger people\u2014so many Black and Latino and Indian chefs who are just starting out\u2014saying, \u2018Wait a second, maybe this isn\u2019t the career for me.\u2019 They have the creative energy and the verve and the youthful exuberance that the restaurant industry needs. If we lose them, I don\u2019t see an industry that has anything to offer.The shell of the restaurant may survive, but the beautiful energy inside may not. If the people are not there, or the people are depressed because they feel like no one cared about them during the pandemic, they\u2019re not going to bring the same passion and energy and joy to it when they come back. It\u2019s just a job\u2014no difference between that and working at a chain restaurant. That, to me, will represent the end of the independent restaurant. We\u2019ll see. I desperately hope I\u2019m wrong.\u201dWe\u2019ve been following how the restaurant industry has been coping with the Coronavirus throughout the year.
