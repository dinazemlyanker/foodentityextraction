Without a doubt, I\u2019ll scoop out \u00bc cup, transfer the rest to a container, tuck it in my fridge, and forget about it until it\u2019s unrecognizable. While tubes of tomato paste don\u2019t go bad nearly as fast and pack more flavor into a smaller volume (they\u2019re double- or triple-concentrated), they\u2019re pricier and I go through them fast.Tomato powder\u2014which is made from dehydrated and pulverized tomatoes\u2014solves both of those problems. Not only does it stay good for a very, very long time (it will keep in your refrigerator almost indefinitely), but it can also be reconstituted to whatever concentration you desire, which means you won\u2019t be left wondering whether your particular paste is inferior to another. (Perhaps something only I worry about?)You can exercise your tomato powder anywhere you\u2019d use tomato paste. (Like with paste, you\u2019ll want to be sure to cook it out until it darkens and starts to stick\u2014that\u2019s how you know the sugars are caramelizing and you\u2019re getting maximum flavor.) Simply mix two parts powder to one part water and then go on your merry way: rigatoni with vodka sauce, tomato and cinnamon-spiced rice, risotto, a marinade for chicken skewers, etc.But tomato powder can also go where tomato paste cannot! It\u2019s dry and sprinkle-able, meaning you can use it similar to a spice in rubs (tomato-rubbed chicken wings?!) or to flavor roasted vegetables or nut mixes. (I had great success using mine to re-create these Pizza Spiced Nuts from Food52.) Or mix it with salt and then use it to season popcorn, to coat the rim of a Bloody Mary glass, or to put a final touch on focaccia dough prebake. (I\u2019ll report back when I try replacing a couple of tablespoons of flour in the dough itself for tomato powder.)While tomato powder is made from only one ingredient (if you guessed tomatoes, you are correct), it can still vary widely. The tomato powder from The Spice House is clown nose\u2013red and as sweet as the summer\u2019s smallest, ripest cherry tomato. Burlap & Barrel\u2019s version, which is made from a particular variety of tomato grown along the coastline of the Aegean Sea in Turkey and dried in the sun, on the other hand, is an orangey-umber color, with a saltier, tangier taste. I use both in my kitchen: The Spice House\u2019s version when I want a bright, purely tomato flavor (in chili, for example) and Burlap & Barrel\u2019s when I\u2019m looking to add complexity and acidity. It\u2019s more of a special occasion sort of deal, reserved for garnishes and final flourishes.Come summer I\u2019ll be mixing tomato powder into mayonnaise, spreading it on toast, and then layering thick slices of juicy beefsteak over. With more tomato powder on top of that, it\u2019ll be the most tomatoey tomato sandwich of all time. Fine, that might be awhile from now\u2014but my tomato powder will be waiting for me, good as the day I bought it, when the time comes.Photo by Emma FishmanBurlap & Barrel Tomato Powder$9 at Burlap & BarrelPhoto by Emma FishmanSpice House Tomato Powder$9 at The Spice HouseExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make.
