And it\u2019s all the more so after getting a taste of what life is like for Mona Talbott and Kate Arding, the owners of Talbott & Arding Cheese and Provisions in Hudson. They share about their weekly farmers market runs, their go-to housewares shops, their perfect hikes with cool contemporary art installations to boot, plus all the restaurants they love for each meal of the day.

We love the bakery and farm\u2019s super fresh breads, especially the rye, made with organic grains it grows and mills.Then we\u2019d walk down Warren Street and check out a few cool stores. Batterby House, a charming kitchen and housewares shop, just expanded, and one of our friends is selling her small-batch Three Dancing Bears Jam there (get the peach preserves). It\u2019s right next door to Red Chair on Warren, our other favorite store in town, which is stocked with absolutely beautiful French antiques.At this point, it\u2019s time for coffee, so we\u2019d stop in at Supernatural Coffee\u2014it\u2019s a real locals\u2019 hangout and we always order the cappuccino, served in local Lail Design mugs.For a late lunch, there\u2019s a relatively new restaurant in town called Cafe Mutton. Chef Shaina Loew-Banayan serves unpretentious, very delicious food\u2014house-made country p\u00e2t\u00e9 sandwiches, seasonally changing rice porridge, scrapple made with local cornmeal and Kinderhook Farm pork\u2014that we really crave.Then we\u2019d get in the car and take our friends to Olana for the most incredible view of the Hudson Valley. It\u2019s a national historic site and has these cool modern art installations.Afterward, we\u2019d head to MX Morningstar Farm, where the owner Max Morningstar sells local breads, cookies, flour, honey, meats, and all his own produce. We think it\u2019s the greatest thing ever.For dinner, Lil\u2019 Deb\u2019s Oasis! We love chefs Carla Perez-Gallardo and Hannah Black\u2019s tropical comfort food. Their cooking is so different from the kind of food we cook, and it\u2019s always fun.WHERE TO STAY:Rivertown Lodge, which is an IG influencer\u2019s dream and has the most welcoming staffWHAT TO BRING BACK:\u00a0A four-pack from Suarez Family Brewery, plus its family-friendly merchExplore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsTravelNew YorkRecipes you want to make.
