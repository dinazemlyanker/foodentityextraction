However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.With a \u201cNative first\u201d philosophy driving everything they do, Ben Jacobs, a member of Osage Nation, and partner Matt Chandra wanted to get the Indigenous-sourced ingredients they use at their fast-casual American Indian restaurants, Tocabe, into more hands. \u201cCommunities of color have to battle for any sort of representation,\u201d Jacobs says. \u201cSo for us, why would we not support our own community in food production?\u201d\u00a0When the pandemic sidelined both of their Denver-area locations, they got to work launching Tocabe Indigenous Market, an online shop for Native-made and grown ingredients that fills a gap most of us have in our pantries. Besides stocking your kitchen with tasty foods\u2014like grass-fed bison, heirloom beans, and rice\u2014each time you click \u201cadd to cart,\u201d you\u2019ll be keeping money in Native economies and providing food for communities in need. (Tocabe donates one item for every two sold on the site.) \u201cWe wanted to create something that was really sustainable for the future,\u201d Jacobs says. \u201cWe\u2019re not just buying a bunch of ingredients; we\u2019re building a relationship with the growers and producers and making sure we\u2019re supporting the Indigenous economy.\u201dHere, Jacobs highlights some of his favorite products.\u00a0S\u00e9ka Hills Extra Virgin Arbequina Olive Oil\u201cThe Yocha Dehe tribe near Napa Valley has one of the most sophisticated olive presses in the U.S., imported and built by Italian artisans. They grow incredible olives to make this earthy dark green olive oil. We use it in all of our salad dressings [at Tocabe] and I take it home and use it with bread all of the time. It\u2019s not a precolonial ingredient, but we support all Native producers.\u201dPhotograph by Paul MillerS\u00e9ka Hills Extra Virgin Arbequina Olive Oil$14 at Tocabe Indigenous MarketRed Lake Nation Lake Harvest Rice\u201cWe source three different rices from Red Lake Nation in northern Minnesota right now, but my favorite is the Lake Harvest. It has a much bigger grain that really puffs up and has some meatiness to it. It\u2019s fantastic as the base of an entr\u00e9e or mixed into salads. You get this really earthy flavor because of the size and how it\u2019s grown.\u201dPaul MillerRed Lake Nation Lake Harvest Rice$13 at Tocabe Indigenous MarketS\u00e9ka Hills Northern California Wildflower Honey\u201cIt tastes like flowers. It\u2019s so naturally sweet, and it\u2019s almost to the point of crystallization that it\u2019s like butter in some ways. This is another product from the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation\u2014they have such an amazing farm and ranch program.\u201dPhotograph by: Paul MillerS\u00e9ka Hills Northern California Wildflower Honey$10 at Tocabe Indigenous MarketRamona Farms Heirloom Black Tepary Bean\u201cThese Sonoran grown beans are unlike any other. They have to simmer for up to six hours, but you can\u2019t overcook them\u2014they retain their bite and creaminess and are super nutrient packed.\u201dPhotograph by Paul MillerRamona Farms Heirloom Black Tepary Bean$10 at Tocabe Indigenous MarketTocabe House Dry Rub\u201cNot all of the chile powder, smoked paprika, and fluffy sage that go into this are tribally produced, but we use it every day in the restaurants on all sorts of bison cuts. You can use it on any kind of meat\u2014we like it on game meats and roasted vegetables to really elevate the flavor.\u201dPaul MillerTocabe House Dry Rub$5 at Tocabe Indigenous MarketGrass-fed Bison\u201cWe use all sorts of bison cuts at the restaurants, but we wanted to redistribute the cuts we don\u2019t use, like the tenderloin and New York strip. By bringing in our own bison, so respected and well cared for by Fred DuBray, a rancher and member of the Cheyenne River Lakota Tribe in South Dakota, we can use the bulk of the animal at Tocabe and give the community the opportunity to use the rest. It\u2019s a Native process from start to finish, from the rancher to the processor to us.\u201dPhotograph by Paul MillerGrass-fed Bison$250 at Tocabe Indigenous MarketSpirit Lake Maple Syrup\u201cIf you\u2019re from a maple syrup area, you know what real maple syrup should taste like: caramelly toffee but not overly sweet. This is true traditional syrup. Once you have it, you don\u2019t go back; you can taste the nature within it.\u201dPhotograph by Paul MillerSpirit Lake Maple Syrup$12 at Tocabe Indigenous MarketNo Reservations Needed Tocabe T-shirt\u201cThis was our very first motto, and it\u2019s a fan favorite for sure. \u2018No reservations needed\u2019 is a pun on restaurant reservations\u2014and a political statement.\u201dNo Reservation Tocabe T-shirt$25 at Tocabe Indigenous MarketSakari Cedar Smoked Salt\u201cWhatever you\u2019re eating, this takes it up a notch. Spring Alaska Schreiner of the Valdez Native Tribe forages for the cedar leaves used to smoke this sea salt, which has the most amazing fragrance and taste. I use it at home as a smoky finishing salt.\u201dPhotograph by Paul MillerSakari Cedar Smoked Salt$12 at Tocabe Indigenous MarketExplore Bon App\u00e9titShop TourCultureRecipes you want to make.
