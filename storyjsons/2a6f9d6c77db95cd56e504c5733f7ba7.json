It\u2019s 80 degrees outside! It\u2019s still summer! It ain\u2019t officially over until September 23! Which means if you live in New York, it\u2019s time to sneak out of work early, board the Long Island Railroad, ride it all the way out to the North Fork\u2019s tip, and hunker down at the Sound View, a beachfront hotel in the sleepy town of Greenport.Here is where you\u2019ll find me, sunning myself on the rocky shoreline as the waves lap my toes. Slurping popsicles beside a turquoise pool manned by a beefy blonde lifeguard that looks like he literally answered a casting call for beefy blonde lifeguards. Not showering before dinner so my hair maintains its frizz-less, salty beach waves as long as possible. Sound View is an amalgamation of every nostalgic summer memory I\u2019ve ever had, combined into one retro-on-purpose paradise complete with a quarter mile of private beach, and it\u2019s the only place I want to be right now.\u2018Cause here\u2019s the thing about summering-as-an-adult: By the time you realize it\u2019s happening, most of it\u2019s already booked up with deadlines and family obligations and weddings in the midwest. Which is why it wasn\u2019t until late August that my husband and I finally took a summer weekend trip of our own volition. So we had to make it count.Pretty sure there\u2019s more than one lobster in there.\nPhoto by Tara DonneImmediately upon checking into one of the Sound View\u2019s cedar-paneled rooms, all clean white sheets and sailcloth pillows and views straight out onto the beach (ALL of the rooms at the Sound View look straight out onto the beach), I felt my blood pressure slow. For lunch, we jammed lobster rolls the size of our faces into our faces by the pool. Come late afternoon, we sat on our sandswept porch drinking canned ros\u00e9 and watched the sky turn gold. For dinner at The Halyard (Sound View\u2019s hotel-restaurant-that-decidedly-doesn\u2019t-suck), we grabbed a corner table on the open-air deck and ate peak-season heirloom tomato gazpacho and crisply seared scallops caught just a few miles away. Afterwards, loose on Greenport IPAs, we moseyed over to the piano bar for karaoke night and performed Alanis Morissette duets for a group of drunken Scottish people (all of whom are now our best friends) late into the night. It was a perfect weekend, the kind that made summer feel as endless as it did in the good old days, back before Google calendars existed.Come September 24th, I\u2019ll give up the ghost, shove my swimsuit collection under the bed, switch over to my fall skincare routine, and let summer be pried out of my cold, still-tan fingers. But until then, keep your pumpkin spice nightmares to yourself.Go there: Sound ViewExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendHotelsNorth ForkRead MorecultureThis Stylish Hotel Soothes My Travel-Weary SoulBy Emma FishmanRecipes you want to make.
