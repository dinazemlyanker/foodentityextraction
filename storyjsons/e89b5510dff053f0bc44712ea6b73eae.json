What\u2019s for dinner? Various meats, friends. Various. Meats.In a stew! A \u201chunter\u2019s stew\u201d to keep you warm in the woods, as bigos is typically translated from Polish. There\u2019s usually kielbasa, maybe some bacon, or pork shoulder, whatever hunks of stew meat you happen to have leftover. Cabbage, sauerkraut, potatoes, carrots, and onions make an appearance. It\u2019s a hearty and humble stick-to-your-ribs dish that varies from home to home. Above all, there are meats. Various.In our new recipe, Kat Boytsova starts with bacon, then cooks kielbasa in the bacon fat. Sounds like a good idea, no? Then you remove the kielbasa, which can turn crumbly when cooked too long in soup, but you\u2019ll add it back later. Next, the supporting players drop in: Garlic, tomato paste, spices, onion, cabbage, carrots, potatoes, sauerkraut, and beef stock. A bit of white wine cuts through the pork fat, while other recipes can call for up to two bottle of beer for a particularly...celebratory hunt, I guess. Your call.While researching variations on bigos, we learned that sauerkraut functions in place of lemons, which were hard to find in 18th century Poland. We loved the tang and funk it adds to the rich stew, especially if you use homemade (thanks, Brad) or something fresh from the farmers\u2019 market.

You\u2019ll know the bigos is done when you can slice through a potato with a spoon. Then serve it straight from the Dutch oven with rye or pumpernickel bread, a slather of butter, some fresh dill, maybe a dollop of sour cream, whatever makes you happy.When Kat was developing this recipe, she told us about her grandmother\u2019s Uzbekistan bigos, which was completely vegetarian, with mushroom and eggplant\u2014whatever was overflowing from their farm\u2019s harvest. Then she layered the vegetables with rice, cabbage, and potatoes. If you\u2019re not a kielbasa (or various meats) person, Kat recommends sturdy, earthy vegetables in their place. Anything delicate won\u2019t hold up to the long cook time of the potatoes.And we all could use some holding up. Let this meaty stew keep you warm this winter\u2014I mean, a nice sweater and a scarf could also help\u2014and even better if you get to share it with 6-14 of your closest friends.
