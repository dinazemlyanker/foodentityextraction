In addition to drop-in business, Motzi offers online ordering for pick-up on Thursdays and Sundays. To the great joy of my family, I\u2019ve made it a point to place an order whenever I\u2019m in town.We\u2019ve tried the hearty people\u2019s loaf (good for slicing and sandwiches); the generously-sized English muffins; the delightfully sour classic; the millet raisin, which has more raisins\u2014and plump ones, too!\u2014than any raisin bread I\u2019ve ever encountered; the earthy, seed-spackled benne rye (my personal favorite); and the almost molasses-y chocolate chip cookies, which are brimming with single-origin, bean-to-bar Askinosie chocolate. I have yet to meet a Motzi Bread baked good I won\u2019t devour\u2014and because they frequently add new items to the menu (like end-of-summer focaccia with peaches and rosemary, apple challah for Rosh Hashanah, and cardamom buns), I\u2019m always finding something new to try.The people's loaf at Motzi Bread.\u00a0\nPhoto by Nathan Mitchell\u00a0The owners, Russell Trimmer and Maya Mu\u00f1oz, live directly above the space, where they mill their own flour from grains sourced from farms in the Chesapeake Bay region, like Migrash Farm and Next Step Produce. Even their pastries and sweets\u2014which are as rich and buttery as pastries and sweets should be\u2014are naturally-leavened and 100 percent whole-grain, meaning that they\u2019re also incredibly flavorful. (My mother-in-law and I spent more time than was reasonable naming all of the tasting notes in the chocolate chip cookies. Is that...treacle? Espresso? Wheat germ?)Even more important than the delicious bread is Trimmer and Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s commitment to their neighborhood, the Harwood section of Charles Village\u2014it\u2019s a cornerstone of their business rather than an afterthought. \u201cWe feel very responsible to Baltimore, for what it\u2019s given us but also for its history of white supremacy, including red-lining and divestment from schools. It\u2019s our responsibility to do what we can for the place we\u2019re in,\u201d they told me. Rather than expansion, \u201cour focus is on what the neighborhood is looking for in a bakery.\u201d Their pay-what-you-can policy means that no one is turned away, and the $5 \u201cpay-it-forward\u201d option on the ordering form allows customers to purchase a loaf for someone in need.If I lived in Baltimore, I would eagerly join their weekly subscription service, which allows Motzi to build lasting relationships with their customers while ensuring a baseline revenue to help keep their small business stable. Subscriptions are currently sold out, but when they\u2019re back in stock, I\u2019ll be signing up my parents immediately. Bread for them\u2014and more visits for me.Go there: Motzi BreadExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendBreadBaltimoreRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
