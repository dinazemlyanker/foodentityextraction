Where you make one choice, and you get two glorious results in return? Let me give you an example. You and a couple friends walk into Philadelphia\u2019s Res Ipsa Cafe for dinner, look at the six pastas on the menu, and order all of them in half portions. That's a good decision. You\u2019ll get to try all the carbs coming out of Michael Ferreri's kitchen (win), and you won't feel like a pile of garbage later after you\u2019ve devoured them (win). In this scenario, every bit of gluten that the light from Res Ipsa\u2019s white globe fixtures touches can be yours. And that\u2019s a good thing, because otherwise, it\u2019d be pretty hard to choose. There\u2019s bucatini with monkfish and breadcrumbs. Cavatelli with beans, anchovies, and broccoli. Linguine alle vongole. Gnocchi al sardi. Orecchiette with marjoram, mushrooms, and Parm. Ferreri\u2019s Sicilian-influenced pastas change seasonally, but with rotating specials, you\u2019ll also find new dishes to explore from week to week. And if you're the type to get thirsty, Res Ipsa is BYOB. So on top of getting the full spread of pastas, you also get your wine of choice too. That\u2019s a...yeah, you get it.Go there: Res Ipsa CafeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendPhiladelphiaRestaurantsRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
