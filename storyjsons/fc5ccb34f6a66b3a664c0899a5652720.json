Every brand of chicharrones is different, sopping up more or less of the sauce, so you may need to add more or less water to achieve saucy-clingy consistency. If you can\u2019t find tomatillos, use 4 cups chopped cored plum tomatoes (about 8 medium) to make a salsa roja instead.Ingredients6-8 servings8oz. chicharrones, broken into 1\u201d pieces (about 6 cups), divided2Tbsp. lard, bacon fat, or vegetable oil3jalape\u00f1os or serrano chiles, seeds removed if desired, finely chopped5garlic cloves, finely grated1large white onion, finely chopped, divided\u00bdtsp. freshly ground black pepper1\u00bdtsp. kosher salt, plus more1lb. tomatillos, husks removed, rinsed, choppedRefried beans (for serving)12\u201316warm small corn or flour tortillasChopped cilantro and lime wedges (for serving)PreparationStep 1Place 2 oz.
