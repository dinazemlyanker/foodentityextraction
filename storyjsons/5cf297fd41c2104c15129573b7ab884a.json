Removing the seeds from one of the chiles lessens the punch. If you like more heat, leave them in. If less, scrape out seeds from both chiles.IngredientsMakes about 2\u00bd cups3Tbsp. unsalted butter1large shallot, finely chopped2jalape\u00f1os, seeds removed from 1 chile, both chiles very thinly sliced1lb. fresh (or frozen) cranberries\u2154cup honey\u00bdtsp. kosher salt2tsp. finely grated lime zest2Tbsp. fresh lime juicePreparationStep 1Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat.

I omitted the shallot, and added the full juice and zest of two limes, without measuring. Otherwise, I followed the directions entirely.   The sauce cooked up beautifully and after it had cooled a bit, I transferred it into a couple. of glass jars and placed them in the refrigerator to chill for a couple of days.  It really helped develop and intensify the lime flavor and the heat from the jalape\u00f1o, so I definitely recommend taking this step.      \n\nAs others have noted, this is not a sweet cranberry sauce -- it is tart and on the savory side.  I found this to be a good contrast with other sweet dishes.        KitchenHawkSacramento, CA11/27/2020I thought this was just the right level of sweetness, but the lime was a little overpowering. I\u2019d start with adding half of the zest, and then adding the rest to tasteAnonymousorange, ca11/26/2020I'm not a fan of the traditional sweet cranberry sauce, so this lime-y spicy version was perfect for me! I seeded one jalapeno per the recipe but found the final sauce wasn't that spicy. Next time I'll keep the seeds in for both.AnonymousNew York 11/25/2019Wow!!! Doing a southwestern twist for Thanksgiving this year. This is fabulous! I think it would be great on pork. Of course will have traditional cranberry sauce also. magsfarm38242PHOENIX 11/22/2019This was really tasty! It took me a bit to get used to it since it tastes so different than regular cranberry sauce, the shallot really brought it together in a way I absolutely didn't expect! I don't think I prefer it to traditional sauce, but I'd make it again regardless!dsasalaBuffalo10/23/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titSauceAmericanCranberryBerryFruitJalape\u00f1oChileVegetableLimeCitrusSideGluten-FreeNut-FreeVegetarianSimmerThanksgivingRecipes you want to make.
