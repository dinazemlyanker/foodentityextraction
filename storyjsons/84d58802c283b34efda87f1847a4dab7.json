See our past recommendations here!My favorite way to solve my problems is to buy stuff. One recent problem: I tried golf a few months ago but every time I tried to make the stick hit the ball, the stick would slam into the grass, shooting pain up my arm into my back. This led to a minor back spasm that made my waking and sleeping life miserable. To lessen the pain, I\u2019d massage my back with Carla Lalli Music\u2019s Thera Cane, which I never gave back. Sorry, Carla!! It\u2019s an S-curved piece of plastic with two prongs and rounded tip that digs into your muscles in a way I imagine a masseuse would, if I could afford deep tissue massage and wasn\u2019t terrified of strangers\u2019 touches.\u201cFeel better and save money\u201d is Thera Cane\u2019s slogan, and why not yours too? On the company\u2019s site, you can watch hilarious tutorials as gently muscled beige people in brandless workout gear probe the cane into their bodies\u2019 crannies, staring blankly forward. The shape of the cane means you can apply pretty intense force depending on the angle you take when using it. For example, if you slept funny, you can put the curved corner to your left (like a comedian getting pulled off-stage) and press one of the ball-ended prongs into your neck. You can dig the end of the curve into that slope between your neck and shoulder after carrying a tote bag of potatoes. Or! Hook the curve behind you like you\u2019re paddling a canoe and get into that creaky lower back. I tucked the curved end under my shoulder blade and gently moved the bottom of the cane up and down in front of me. It loosened up the junk from attempting golf of all freaking sports, increased oxygen flow in my bod (I think??), and made me look very cool while doing so.I find it best to scrunch up your face and make cow-like moans as you stab yourself in the near-spine at your desk in an open office. When I pull out the Thera Cane for a post-lunch pick-me-up, people come running to take their turn. Sometimes we stand around and argue about seeds in fruits, passing the cane around. Perhaps shared pain is more manageable than suffering alone.Buy it: Thera Cane, $32All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
