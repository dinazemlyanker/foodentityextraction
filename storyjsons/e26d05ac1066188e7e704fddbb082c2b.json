I tossed all the ingredients in a wide mouth mason jar and hit it with an immersion blender.\n\nAlso making your own croutons makes a world of difference. Honestly use whatever bread you have on hand - I\u2019ve tried this with several different kinds of bread and even sandwich bread works in a pinch!\n\nPerfectly quick and so delicious!!!SKLos Angeles 10/29/2021This is a great recipe. I used half the mustard. (Not a fan of mustardy) And to think that I made this on the spur of the moment, then to my huge dismay I had NO fresh garlic. Nada. What?!!! That Has NEVER happened in my kitchen since 1982! Omg! I always always have garlic! I subbed a lot of dried garlic granules and it STILL turned out great! Stored 3/4 of the beautiful  emulsified dressing for another time. Ate 1/4 of the salad in a state of bliss. \nDivine! O-Sushi-QAnacortes, Washington10/26/2021Great dressing recipe! I doubled it and made the entire dressing in a mason jar using an emersion blender. Only 3 tweaks: 3 anchovies, HALF a cup of oil (as opposed to 2/3) and 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce for the DOUBLE dressing recipe. AnonymousNova Scotia, Canada4/24/2021\"..and toss gently with clean hands until lettuce is coated..\"  How entirely pretentious and unnecessary to use your hands. Use one of your several utensils.My name is going here3/25/2021Can this be made ahead of timeCheryl ZukowskiFlorida 12/28/2020Yum! Made this for lunch today for the first time.

Much love to all of you in front of the camera and behind it \u2665angela_mcSan Antonio, Texas4/19/2020Love this recipe, it is literally one of my husband's favorite dinners. I throw some chipotle in with my croutons and its so good!danideviousLos Angeles11/18/2019absolutely perfect!\nand YES...we used two anchovies!\n\u2764\ufe0fsassygirl711chicago4/14/2019Absolutely love this recipe! Made it for the first time today, I\u2019ve been looking for a salad recipe that I wouldn\u2019t hate, smashed it! Soph121xoxUnited Kingdom2/13/2019This is a great recipe!  I\u2019ve made it three times, added extra anchovies being my only modification.  The home made croutons really stand out, so take a few minutes and do that.  Store bought would not do as well.  Big hit with company and family, fast and easy.angelaspWashington8/30/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladRomaineLettuceLeafy GreensVegetableParmesanCheeseEasyQuickWeeknight MealsSideMainLunchDinnerBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
