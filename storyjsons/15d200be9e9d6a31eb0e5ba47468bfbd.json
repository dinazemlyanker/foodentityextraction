There\u2019s only one guy that works in the kitchen. He cooks everything. He\u2019s from Italy. It\u2019s always slammed. There are hardly any seats. You have to go early on a weeknight if you want to get in without waiting for like...two hours. It\u2019s affordable. There\u2019s a weird, vague Elvis theme. It\u2019s across the street.\u201dUh, what? Elvis? Pasta? Are you sure? Wait. It\u2019s in an Irish pub?A quick visit to the restaurant\u2019s website (read: Facebook page) and Google image gallery substantiated my friend\u2019s claims. The poorly lit photos looked good in the way that Bolognese looks good after your third beer.In case the Irish-Italian mix wasn\u2019t enough, you\u2019ll find a splattering of Elvis memorabilia in the bar for a bit of retro Americana splendor.\nPhoto by Jason VarneyWe should go. Like, right now.And we went. Well, we showed up. We didn\u2019t eat, because it turned out that my friend was also right about it being slammed on a Saturday night. All of the chairs in the small room just beyond the back of the bar were filled with people, their tables filled with pasta. We walked a few blocks and ate pizza instead, and I went to bed dreaming of the red sauce I saw on the internet.I\u2019m not the type to watch dreams float by. So I did eventually eat at Murph\u2019s. I ordered fried zucchini flowers and octopus salad and sausage and Bolognese and garganelli with braciola, while making nervous eye contact with the inexplicable Elvis Presley statue next to an Irish flag behind the bar. I ate my food. I drank a Guinness. And an $8 glass of Nero d\u2019Avola. I ate a cannoli. And I enjoyed myself. But the entire time, I was quietly thinking, What the hell is this place? How did someone create a bar/restaurant that so perfectly speaks to me, an Irish-Italian-American? And who is making this food?At Murph\u2019s, ordering a Guinness with your pasta is not only possible, it\u2019s encouraged.\nPhoto by Jason VarneyFrancesco Bellastelli came to Philadelphia from Puglia (the heel of the boot) to be with his wife and her family, and he\u2019s been cooking at Murph\u2019s for about five years. He is the man who is making this food. He prefers to speak Italian (his answers for this interview were translated by his wife), and he drank at Murph\u2019s before he ever cooked there.\u201cMy neighbor, my wife\u2019s cousin, and I were at Murph\u2019s having a drink. They were regulars. I got hungry and wanted to eat, but the bar didn\u2019t serve food,\u201d explains Bellastelli. \u201cWe eventually talked to one of the owners, and he said he had an empty kitchen downstairs and asked if I would be interested in renting it.\u201dBellastelli was interested. He began renting the unused kitchen space from the bar\u2019s owners, Theresa and Greg Walton, in 2014, and a mutually beneficial relationship blossomed. The Waltons had a new stream of customers coming into the bar, in search of Italian food, and Bellastelli had the opportunity to serve burrata, orecchiette, octopus salad, and other dishes from his region of Italy.Chef Francesco Belastelli, the man from Puglia.\nPhoto by Jason Varney\u201cIn the beginning, I think people would get confused,\u201d says Belastelli about the patrons walking into an Irish pub and finding ravioli. \u201cBut now they come for the Italian food and drinks. I feel very fortunate that it has been so popular, and that I found Theresa and Greg. Without their open-mindedness, this probably wouldn\u2019t have worked.\u201dIt also wouldn\u2019t have worked without good food.Six days a week, Belastelli works from 6:30 a.m. to 11 p.m., making classics like seafood manicotti (the restaurant\u2019s most popular dish) and the Amatriciana (one of his personal favorites). It\u2019s unfussy, plated without the consideration of a fine dining establishment. And it\u2019s not always totally Italian: On St. Patrick\u2019s Day, he makes ham and cabbage arancini to marry his Italian heritage and his Irish digs in a more direct sense.What else would you expect to eat at an Irish pub in Philadelphia while sitting across the room from a lamp shaped like Elvis Presley?Alex Delany is an associate editor at Bon App\u00e9tit.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsRed SauceItalian AmericanPhiladelphiaRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
