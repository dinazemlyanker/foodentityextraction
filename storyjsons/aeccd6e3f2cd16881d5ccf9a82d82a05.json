My apartment has never looked better, my skin is so hydrated I finally know what \u201cglowing from within\u201d means, and I even enjoy running, a thing I would have tacked slightly above \u201cgoing to brunch\u201d in a list of things I would enjoy doing. My friendships and family connections are stronger thanks to daily check-ins, and I am busier than ever now that everyone, literally, is cooking at home. Aside from the low-grade anxiety and general ennui, I guess you could say I am flourishing! But my dating life has, um, how do you say: not flourished. In all fairness, this was absolutely true of my pre-quarantine life too, but I save that stuff for my therapist every Wednesday at 10 a.m.But...I did try. When quarantine began, I decided I wanted to be bolder, to be more forward about my desire for personal connections and romance-y things and, yes, to have phone sex, a thing I had not ever done before (I know, I know). The whole world felt new and different, which made me feel like I could be, too.I reached out to the single women I know (there are two of them), asking how they were maintaining their robust dating lives under the new rules of life. They all enthusiastically echoed one another: \u201cSo. Much. Swiping.\u201d There was sexting, there were Zoom dates, an onslaught of tasteful and not-as-tasteful nudes peppered with a few choice horny video messages. We were in a golden age of online dating! To hear I wasn\u2019t taking advantage, well, they weren\u2019t mad, just disappointed.In the \u201cbefore\u201d, I would have said the digital version of courtship was not for me. I prefer to meet people the old fashioned way, on a subway platform where we look up and discover we are reading the same New Yorker article and share a small smile, then one of us gets off before we can exchange numbers and then spend the rest of the movie trying to find each other until we realize we are neighbors and it was you all along!But we were living in a brave new world now, one without the option of human to human contact. And I couldn\u2019t help but wonder: Was I going to be a brave new girl in this brave new world?So I decided to go on \u201cthe apps\u201d with a positive attitude and an open mind. I would be vulnerable and confident. I would message first. I would not open with a quarantine joke. I would try (genuinely try!) to meet people, casually date, maybe even build actual intimacy. I would possibly send a nude.Imagine how hot it would be to have all this getting-to-know-you build-up and then finally be able to meet in REAL LIFE?I downloaded the two that felt the least scary: Raya and Hinge. I followed the standard journey of downloading, deleting, and re-downloading. I swiped while I was falling asleep and when I was waking up like it was Instagram, swapping one scrolling addiction for another. I matched and then unmatched. Generally unimpressed with the selection and busier than I thought I\u2019d be with work (it\u2019s called distraction as a way to avoid intimacy, i.e., a defense mechanism! See, therapy does work), I wouldn\u2019t exactly say I was having the golden age experience I was sold.In the event of a match, I\u2019d say there was a 45 percent chance of messaging, and I can confidently say that that 45 percent was the most annoying part of this whole virtual courtship. Opening the app to see if they had messaged me back filled me with a not-so-quiet desperation, and I truly hated this communication purgatory. Luckily, things either fizzled out pretty quickly or they said something so generically annoying that it made me never want to have sex with a man ever again.\u201cHow are you holding up?\u201d (NOT WELL, MARC WITH A C!), \u201cI made your pasta\u201d (that is not a pickup line), \u201cIf coronavirus doesn\u2019t take you out, can I?\u201d (kill me) and \u201cI had read your byline and based on your reputation as a domestic goddess I had to assume you were a mother of 5, not a hot 30-something\u201d (um, thanks?). I know that you have to message to move to text to move to FaceTime to move to IRL in 9 months, but damn, there\u2019s got to be a better way?There was a date via FaceTime with an Australian where I taught him how to make focaccia. He didn\u2019t have enough flour and absolutely did not listen to my instructions so the focaccia turned out just \u201cokay.\u201d Focaccia failure aside, I think we are better off as friends, which is actually really nice! He still sends me pictures of his baking attempts, it\u2019s very sweet. Grade: B+I had a few late night phone calls. These truly filled me with a giddiness I hadn\u2019t felt since high school when Jason P. from history class and I would talk ~after hours~. The calls lasted anywhere from 90 minutes to four hours, generally with at least an entire bottle of wine consumed in the duration. These phone dates were super fun and it made me wish dating apps were just modern versions of 1-800 numbers (let\u2019s call them\u2026.1-900 numbers). I think talking on the phone is a dying art and when it\u2019s done well, is extremely hot. Does that make me sound one million years old? If you get past the initial shock of speaking to a stranger on the phone, this method of communication has the potential to be better than texting\u2014and certainly better than an IRL bad date. Like, sure, sex is good, but have you ever talked on the phone under the covers with the lights off bearing your souls until 3 a.m.? I still did not have phone sex. Grade: A-There were a couple other FaceTimes, usually from bed. They weren\u2019t always necessarily sexy in context, but there is something decidedly intimate about the bedroom FaceTime, a thing I typically only experienced with long-term lovers. It made me feel exposed in a way I didn\u2019t love (we should have had phone calls first), so let\u2019s just say next time I agree to a FaceTime date, I\u2019d better be engaged to that person. Plus, the screen thing reminded me of Zoom meetings, the least horny thing on the planet. Grade: BI had a month-long affair with someone who ghosted on me after about a month of trading Zillow links and incessant texts. Truly a shame since I spent all this time on a slideshow of screenshots of our correspondence to celebrate our one-month anniversary, doubly annoying because I even told my mom about him! WHERE DID YOU GO? Just kidding, I didn\u2019t do any of that, but he did virtually ghost on me, which is, sure, less annoying than the IRL version but honestly inexcusable during a global pandemic. If you read this, please never call me! D-I thought quarantine would be the time when I\u2019d finally be able to chat with a hot stranger at a bar without feeling like I was interviewing for a reality show (Raya is basically a reality show). I wanted to flirt with someone without having to coordinate our schedules to meet at Long Island Bar for a drink (\u201cHow about seven Fridays from now?\u201d) but turns out quarantine schedules are almost as annoying to coordinate (\u201cI can\u2019t at 8:30, how\u2019s 10:15?\u201d). I wanted to get to know (like, really get to know!) someone without the expectation or distraction of immediate sex. Imagine how hot it would be to have all this getting-to-know-you build-up and then finally be able to meet in REAL LIFE? Wait, that\u2019s just the premise of that very popular show I could only bring myself to watch one episode of. I knew this felt familiar.Seven weeks later, and what I\u2019ve realized is that it\u2019s a whole new world and also the exact same world. I still hate waking up before 8, I still drink too much wine even when I\u2019m alone (there are so many Zoom hangouts, and wine is so good!), I am still late for almost every deadline (Amanda, I am sorry!) and if you ask my mom, I still don\u2019t call enough. I\u2019m still not that jazzed about the world of online dating, and, again, I still have not had phone sex (I repeat: There has been no phone sex). I still prioritize work over developing personal relationships, am still afraid of rejection, and yeah, \u201cmen are trash\u201d is still a thing I have said in a post-quarantine world.But interestingly (or maybe totally uninteresting), I have \u201cmet\u201d more people than I ever did in \u201cthe before.\u201d Sure, none of them have really panned out, but that\u2019s not always the point of dating\u2014it\u2019s not always about meeting The One, it\u2019s about the journey not the destination, etc etc. (or so I\u2019m told!).To quote my friend Susan, we are all just trying our best. And I will continue to try my best, because if this pandemic has taught me anything, it\u2019s that, yes, I can thrive in isolation, but it sure would be nice to have someone help me eat all these roast chickens. And since we aren\u2019t riding the subway right now and someone keeps stealing my New Yorker, I might as well keep swiping.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishCoronavirusHealthyish Guide to Being AloneessayRead MoreCoronavirusHawa Hassan Is Feeding Hospital Workers At the Epicenter of COVID-19By Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
