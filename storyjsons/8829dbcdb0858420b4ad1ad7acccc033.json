Just make sure to buy whole-leaf frozen spinach instead of chopped.Ingredients10 servingsKosher salt2lb. frozen whole-leaf spinach, divided\u00bccup sesame seeds (not toasted)\u00bccup low-sodium soy sauce or tamari\u00bccup unseasoned rice vinegar3Tbsp. mirin (Japanese rice wine)PreparationStep 1Bring a large pot of water to a boil; season generously with salt. Stir in half of frozen spinach and cook, stirring, until warmed through, about 30 seconds. Using a spider or slotted spoon, transfer spinach to a rimmed baking sheet and spread out in an even layer. Return water to a boil, then repeat process with remaining spinach. Chill spinach at least 30 minutes and up to 3 hours.Step 2Meanwhile, toast sesame seeds in a dry small skillet over medium-low heat, shaking skillet occasionally, until slightly darkened in color and fragrant, about 4 minutes. Transfer seeds to a plate and let cool slightly. Pour into a resealable plastic bag and seal pressing out air. Using a rolling pin or wine bottle, crush seeds until mostly mashed but with some whole seeds remaining; transfer to a large bowl. Add soy sauce, vinegar, and mirin and whisk to combine.Step 3Working over the sink, grab one small handful of spinach at a time and squeeze out as much water as possible with your hands, then transfer to bowl with dressing. Once all spinach has been added to bowl, toss with your hands, taking care to break up any clumps so that spinach gets well-coated.How would you rate Easy Gomae (Japanese-Style Spinach Salad)?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (1)Back to TopTriangleGomae .. sesame , horenso ... spinach = horemso goma\u00e9 philouD\u00fcsseldorf 5/25/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladJapaneseEast AsianAsianSpinachLeafy GreensVegetableEasySideDairy-FreeGluten-FreeVegetarianVeganDinnerRecipes you want to make.
