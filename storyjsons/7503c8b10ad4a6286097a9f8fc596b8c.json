I agree with the reviewer below, not quite balanced without the toast part. If you\u2019re anti bread maybe dress some greens in the toast toppings and find a crunchy component to add. New staple recipe for me!AnonymousOR6/25/2021Wow this is good! I ate it for three meals this week and already want to make it again. The salad is good by itself, but the harissa yogurt on toast really makes the dish. I subbed in parsley for cilantro because I didnt have any, and used giardiniera instead of peperoncini. Easy to make, so fresh and flavorful. HMichigan4/15/2021So fresh and easy to make. I make the chuckle salad weekly now without the toast and just eat it plain as a nice healthy prepped snack / lunch salad! Love itAnna wardSan Clemente CA3/5/2021I made just the smashed chick pea salad to put on top of my green salad - and while delicious is was way too lemony, perhaps needing the toast and yogurt to balance it. I\u2019ll do it again on salad with less lemon or maybe with red wine vinegar instead, and also try the full dish. Yum!Lisa NJ11/11/2020this is great for anyone who wants to eat something cold and savory on a hot day in the summer. its quick, fresh, and filling! I think I added too much shallot so be cautious because your breath might be smelly..AnonymousPalo Alto, CA5/26/2020Great vegetarian pantry sandwich that still delivers some zing.ssfarionPhiladelphia, PA5/14/2020Quite satisfying, and would be easy to make substitutions based on what herbs/dairy/crunchy veg you have.AnonymousCalifornia5/9/2020Yeah this is perfect, so f'kin good \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffcmst1228Minneapolis, MN4/7/2020This was fantastic. I had my doubts about a smashed chickpea sandwich filling. But with the addition of celery, picked veg, and shallots... much like you would use in tuna salad, DELICIOUS! Also, the yogurt harissa spread is genius. Such a delicious sandwich/toast topper.  Anonymous902913/23/2020DELISH! super tasty and fresh recipe perfect for the hotter days. the lemon, garlic, celery and shallot add a nice bright freshness to the recipe. i might even throw in some chopped up capers the next time round. becuase there is quite alot of liquid from the veg going around in this recipe, i feel like this dish can take on quite a hefty amount of salt and pepper to get it to the right seasoning. my friend who hates celery was pleasantly surprised at what it brings to this dish. none of that bitterness, and a whole lot of freshness! niccsuxSingapore1/19/2020Delicious and versatile recipe! AnonymousWisconsin11/19/2019This recipe is really delicious! I tried it with and without rubbing garlic on the toast, and I think without is nicer. The taste of raw garlic was a bit overpowering. A really lovely vegetarian lunch ideaemylouParis6/13/2019Fantastic!   I used great white northern beans instead of chickpeas.   Better than avocado toast in my opinion - flavors were complex and fresh without being overpowering.   Definitely will have this regularly in the fridge - I served it for breakfast, but could be for any meal.AnonymousGreenwood, Virginia, United States2/24/2019I used home-cooked chickpeas instead of canned. The chickpea mixture smells and tastes so fresh. It also keeps nicely, so you can definitely make a batch of this early in the week and come back to it for a lunch or snack whenever.AnonymousMinneapolis, MN6/7/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titToastNorth AfricanAfricanChickpeaBeanVegetableHarissaCondiments, Sauces & PastesYogurtOther IngredientsQuickEasySnackStarterNut-FreeVegetarianHealthyishRamadanLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
