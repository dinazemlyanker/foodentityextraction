All would be stuffed into a brown paper bag, \u00e0 la elementary school.Rookie mistake. One time, I made goat curry with friends and excitedly packed up the plastic container, stuffed it in the \u201ctrusty\u201d brown paper bag, and tossed it into my backpack. On my way into the office, I noticed that the bottom of my backpack was wet. I unzipped it to find a small pond of goat curry liquid at the bottom, clumped with soggy pieces of brown paper.It was time to graduate to a next-level lunch bag. One that would prevent strange pools of liquid that put my backpack (and work-issued laptop) in danger. But I didn\u2019t want a Star Wars AT-AT lunch box from grade school. I wanted the best lunch bag that also made me look and feel like a working professional. After spending literal weeks combing through reviews and sites, making pro-con lists, and even experiencing a couple of failed orders, I finally found a lunch bag that didn\u2019t necessarily look like a lunch bag.Lokass is the best insulated lunch bag I\u2019ve tried. The key word being insulated: My old office fridge often resembled a museum of failed experiments, filled to the brim with fuzzy blue-and-white oddities, so I like to keep my food at my desk\u2014where it\u2019s easier to sneak a bite too. I have the navy blue floral one, and thanks to the shoulder strap, I can even wear the Lokass bag as a full-on purse (the front pocket also helps store my phone and wallet). I\u2019ve popped inside a couple of ice packs along with a can of ginger ale, and things stayed nice and cool from early morning to about 2 p.m. The brand specializes in durable bags, and this one has three layers: PEVA, foam padding, and canvas. With its zipper compartment, everything is cozily locked into place, and the bonus? It\u2019s waterproof. (So long food puddles, hello gorgeous gorgeous soup!)The bag comes in 17 styles and at least three different sizes, including one with separate compartments if you want to keep some things warm and other things cold. During these days of WFH, it\u2019s also the best insulated lunch bag for a wintry hike, that trip to the ice rink, or stashing a bottle of bubbly on the way to a friend\u2019s place. But I\u2019m waiting for the day I can proudly take my very fashionable lunch bag with me to the office (with all its food intact!) and place it front and center on my desk for everyone to see.Photograph by Isa Zapata. \u00a0Food Styling by Pearl JonesLokass Insulated Lunch Box$20 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make.
