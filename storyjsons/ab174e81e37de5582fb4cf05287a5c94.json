The Frenchmen Street bars are the last stop on her freewheeling guide to NOLA, but before all that, she\u2019s got recs for solid po\u2019boys, cocktails, and museums and parks for a little breather. This is how she shows friends around her chosen city, and now you\u2019re getting the full introduction.Check out more food-focused itineraries from our favorite food people here.Inside Paladar 511Photo by Denny CulbertCocktail in hand at Cane & TablePhoto by Denny CulbertNew OrleansIf you\u2019ve got just a single day in New Orleans, you have two challenges: deciding which corner of the city to get lost in and pacing yourself between each delicious stop. Tackle both with my guide.I don\u2019t usually eat big breakfasts, but I\u2019ll make an exception at the Orange Couch. I love to kick-start my morning there with coffee and whatever pastry catches my eye.From there, head over to The National WW II Museum for a grounding education in global history. There\u2019s never enough time to see everything, so choose any exhibition and dive into the details.For lunch, we\u2019re zipping over to Parkway Bakery & Tavern in Mid City for po\u2019boys (the restaurant calls them poor boys). I love a good po\u2019boy, and nobody does it like we do in New Orleans. I\u2019m always craving roast beef, catfish, or oyster, but no matter what, I ask for it dressed. Around here, that means with mayo, lettuce, and tomatoes.Then it\u2019s back downtown to walk it all off at Crescent Park for unparalleled views of the Mississippi River before stopping at Bacchanal for a bottle of wine. If you\u2019re lucky, Rapha\u00ebl Bas is onstage cranking out cheerful tunes from his electric guitar.For dinner, it\u2019s gotta be Paladar 511. Anyone who knows me knows I love Italian food, and everything here is fresh and flavorful. Order the pizzas, but don\u2019t skip the squid ink pasta or the agnolotti.After dinner, grab drinks at Cane & Table. Trust the bartenders\u2019 recommendations, or try mine: the Jamaica Queens, scented with cardamom that reminds me of home on St. Lucia.We\u2019ll follow our ears into the late night, dancing at any of the Frenchmen Street bars with their doors flung open, before landing at Dat Dog, exhausted, happy\u2014and hungry. It\u2019s open late, and the hot dogs are perfect to soak up the night.WHERE TO STAY:The Old No. 77,\u00a0a funky hotel in the center of thingsWHAT TO BRING BACK:\u00a0Le Grand Coq Rouge beans from French Truck CoffeeExplore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsTravelNew OrleansRecipes you want to make.
