But finding an affordable place to live while also putting herself through college proved challenging. White, now 31, graduated from Portland State University with a B.S. in community development in 2017, the first in her family to graduate from college. But it wasn\u2019t until she attended a program at Dress for Success that she was able to find employment that aligned with her major.Through a job retention manager at Dress for Success, White heard about a Portland-based nut butter company called Ground Up. Founded by Julie Sullivan and Carolyn Cesario two years ago, Ground Up hires disadvantaged women\u2014usually either formerly homeless or trafficked\u2014and helps them gain job skills, confidence, and, ultimately, a steady, rewarding job.While not the target population that Ground Up works with (White had never been homeless or trafficked) she was seeking an opportunity to build a career. \u201cShe is someone who feels very passionately about our mission of empowerment,\u201d Cesario says. Today, White does demonstrations at Whole Foods and local grocery store chain New Seasons, where she shares the story about the nut butter and what it\u2019s doing for her and other women. \u201cThen I start sharing my little story and I\u2019m like, \u2018You\u2019re supporting me by giving me a living wage!\u2019 That really grabs their attention,\u201d says White.Sullivan and Cesario met while working for ethical fashion brands based in Uganda, helping impoverished women gain skills, savings, and eventually the money and know-how to start their own micro-enterprises. Sullivan had just moved back to Portland, where the homelessness crisis had worsened, and wanted to help women master job skills so they could transition off the streets. \u201cI saw the training program work in Uganda, I thought, \u2018It should be possible here, too!\u2019\u201d she says.While casting about for a business idea, she met Cesario, who was tinkering around with gourmet nut butters that got rave reviews from family and friends. \u201cSo, one day, Julie asked me how to make them and she came over and we made nut butters for hours,\u201d recalls Cesario. The two were up until midnight making coconut-cardamom almond-cashew butter with chia seeds, and a snickerdoodle almond-cashew butter.The duo launched Ground Up PDX in June 2016, making their first couple batches with a Cusinart. Over the past two years, they\u2019ve gone from selling their nut butters at a few farmers\u2019 markets to having them line the shelves at most Portland-area grocery stores, including Whole Foods. (Later this month, they\u2019ll be at all Whole Foods in Washington state, too.) Their nut butters, which they make at a local food hub and business incubator called the Redd, are also available at the cafeterias of Adidas, Columbia, and Daimler.Cesario and Sullivan also partner with case managers and coaches at nonprofits such as Outside In, The Cupcake Girls, Door to Grace, and Dress for Success. Claire Anderson, a career development coach at Outside In, has referred five women to Ground Up. \u201cSome of our women have had some great experience in the past, but due to some life circumstance, had back-tracked, or have a gap in their resume,\u201d Sullivan says. Three of the five young women from Outside In who have gone through Ground Up\u2019s training program are now housed and paying their own rent.One of the women at Ground Up explained the joy of working alongside like-minded women in a holiday blog post. \u201cEverything we worked at this holiday season has never been accomplished by Ground Up PDX before! We\u2019re pioneering a process. The chaos of Christmas was promptly conquered by the resourcefulness of a small, sassy, SMART group of women,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe best part is, we killed it while helping support and teach one another.\u201dSo far, nine women have gone through the job training program, which is anywhere from six to nine months long, and pays a living hourly wage for between 5 and 20 hours of work per week. The women who work at Ground Up learn everything from roasting coconut flakes and running the nut butter \u201cfilling machine,\u201d to lidding, labeling, and orchestrating tastings at farmers\u2019 markets and grocery stores. Though the program is intended to be a stepping-stone to another job, two of the women have become so invaluable that they\u2019ve stuck around as a sales and production assistant and a demo specialist.For White, who recently got a part-time job working in admissions for an alternative high school, one of the best parts of the Ground Up job is the autonomy she has. \u201cCarolyn and Julie trust me, and that\u2019s great,\u201d she says. \u201cI have so much respect for them, giving me all that responsibility.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishNut ButterPortlandPortland OregonTrendsRead MoreLifestyleWhich of These 9 Nut Butters Are Both Healthy and Delicious?By Tehrene FirmanRecipes you want to make.
