I\u2019m here to tell you that most of it is untrue and extraneous\u2014especially a hand-forged, monogrammed, iron steak brander.If you want to grill, you need three things: 1) a grill, 2) a pair of 18\u201d tongs, 3) and a headlamp. The grill is self-explanatory. The tongs are essential for keeping your hands at a comfortable distance while you move things around on the grates. The headlamp, though, is the single most important tool because eventually, no matter how well you think you\u2019ve planned it, the sun will set on you. And when it does, you will be that person in the dark trying to tell if your steak is sufficiently charred or if your chicken is cooked through, and no, dragging the floor lamp from your living room out onto the deck is not a solution. Switching on your phone\u2019s flashlight and holding it in the air with one hand while you try to grill with the other also doesn\u2019t work. Asking a friend hold a flashlight for you makes you dependent on others. It also makes you look unprepared.The only thing that will save you when the sun sets is a headlamp. Like a spelunker, like a survivalist, like a neurosurgeon, your nighttime grilling necessitates hands-free seeing. I started rocking this classic, battery-powered model from Black Diamond many grill-seasons ago, and my only regret was that it took me that long to see the light (sorry). Sure, some people say I look dorky, but those people don\u2019t know anything about grilling, so who cares what they think.I think it\u2019s cool to be prepared. I think it\u2019s cool to be able to see in the dark. I think it\u2019s cool to have proper equipment. And I think it\u2019s cool to continue to feed your friends even after the sun goes down. It\u2019s headlamp season\u2014and I\u2019m ready.Photo by Chelsie CraigBlack Diamond Cosmo Headlamp$30 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendToolsShoppingRecipes you want to make.
