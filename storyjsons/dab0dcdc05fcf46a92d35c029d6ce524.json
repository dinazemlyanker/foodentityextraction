Pour in oil, then add leeks and onion and stir to coat. Season generously with salt and black pepper. Set lid askew over pot (depending on the make and model of your pressure cooker, you can set the lid off-center or close it down part way) and cook, stirring every few minutes, until leeks are bright green and vegetables are softened but still juicy-looking and not browned, 8\u201310 minutes.Step 2Meanwhile, make 2 or 3 vertical cuts into outer band of skin on ham hocks (this will help the fat cook out and the meat tenderize under pressure). Cut lemon in half and squeeze juice into a small bowl.Step 3Add cumin, cayenne, and turmeric to leek mixture and stir to combine. Cook, stirring, until spices are very fragrant, about 1 minute. Nestle ham hocks into vegetables so that cut sides make contact with cooking surface. Cook undisturbed until fat starts to cook out, about 3 minutes. Add split peas and stir to coat; season with salt. Stir in 6 cups water. Lock lid and set machine to cook at high pressure 12 minutes (allow 20 minutes or so for it to come to pressure). Manually release pressure. Transfer ham hocks to a cutting board and let cool slightly.Step 4Pick meaty pieces off ham hocks and cut into small pieces, then stir ham back into soup. Taste and season soup with salt, black pepper, and lemon juice.Bacon Croutons and AssemblyStep 5While soup is cooking, melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat until foaming. Add bacon and cook, stirring, until bacon has released about half its fat and is starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add bread pieces and toss well to coat. Cook, tossing occasionally, until croutons are golden brown and starting to crisp and bacon is chewy-crisp, about 5 minutes. Mix in \u00bd tsp. red pepper flakes; season with salt.Step 6Divide soup among bowls. Top with bacon croutons and a drizzle of oil; season with salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over.Step 7Do Ahead: Soup (without toppings) can be made 3 days ahead. Let cool, then cover and chill. Reheat gently, stirring and adding water to loosen if needed.How would you rate Instant Pot Split Pea Soup?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleI really wish they'd include a non-instant-pot translation of this recipe.
