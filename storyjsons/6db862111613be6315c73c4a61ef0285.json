I wanted to heat up the tofu, but decided to make as written. It came out great, and was actually refreshing with uncooked tofu. AnonymousLos Angeles, CA10/5/2021Not bad. I get a bit tired of the use of garlic and ginger in a lot of Asian recipes. I like the sauce even simpler - just great tahini and artisanal soy sauce and a dab of red miso all mixed and thinned with ice water. Maybe a squeeze of lime. Could just be me but simple flavors can ring truer and not be as muddy.  EssieDee Stamford ct12/3/2020As another review points out, this recipe kind of falls off at the end and doesn\u2019t tell you what to do with the tofu. \n\nHere\u2019s what I did (and it turned out great!) - I marinated the tofu in the sauce for about 10 minutes, then put it on a parchment paper-lined sheet pan, and put it in the oven (which was already on 350\u00b0F for the cashews) for about 12 minutes, flipping it halfway through. Just long enough to get it a little browned and crispy on the outside. Once the bowls were assembled, I tossed the tofu on top along with an additional drizzle of the sauce. \n\nThis recipe is very flavorful and I think the sauce would work nicely with shrimp or even possibly some kind of nice fish fillet.jreyes1905Texas5/27/2020I have made this recipe twice and both times we loved it.  Even my husband who is not a fan of tofu enjoyed it.  The first time I did not have cucumbers, so I substituted some raw zucchini.  The second time I did not have raw cashews and did not miss them.  Also, I had extra firm tofu so I let it marinate a few minutes longer.  I did not put the asparagus on ice water, I just set them aside when done.  This is certainly a dish that I will serve for guests who don't eat meat.  Leftovers are a great lunch.\nJoanneRRMississauga, ON5/7/2020This recipe is a great base of ingredients and seasonings to improvise with. I've made sesame noodles in the past that have oil and peanut butter in them, and I like the tahini and mirin better--it's lighter and a slightly more creamy flavor. I didn't have tofu so I put a soft boiled egg on top. 10/10!!gillian211191405/2/2020Does the tofu now get cooked?Anonymous12/5/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titMisoCondiments, Sauces & PastesTahiniAsparagusVegetableTofuOther IngredientsEgg NoodleNoodlePasta & NoodlesSpringMainVegetarianHealthyishLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
