Literally: It was December in Chicago, and my first real winter. In the great tradition of college students improving on cheap alcohol, people were coping with the sub-zero temperatures by spiking boxed wine with bourbon, cinnamon sticks, and orange slices. Think mulled wine vibes, only even sweeter and also cold. I wasn\u2019t a fan.Fast forward to last year, when a pinkish pitcher packed with cucumber slices and mint appeared in the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen. Dangerously drinkable, this was ros\u00e9 sangria\u2014a far cry from the collegiate version.Kat Boytsova\u2019s recipe steers clear of syrupy-sweet sangria territory not only by starting with ros\u00e9 instead of a bottle of red or white. She swaps out chopped fruit for refreshing cucumber; replaces warming spices with a tangle of mixed herbs; and tops it off with fizzy citrus soda, which cuts back on the sweetness. Oh, and there\u2019s \u00bd cup bianco vermouth for an extra kick. I drank an inappropriate amount for 2 p.m. on a workday, then immediately started plotting an occasion to make a pitcher of my own.The opportunity came just a few weeks later, when I was home visiting my family in L.A. It was the perfect scene for sangria: my family was gathering in the sunny backyard with Bossa Nova Civic Club on low in the background. I sliced up a few cucumbers into spears, then smashed one up with a rolling pin to release allll the cucumber juice for maximum spa water vibes. I took an equally aggressive approach with the herbs, smacking a bundle of lemon thyme and mint against the cutting board until the kitchen smelled like an essential oil party. Then everything went into the prettiest pitcher I could find and chilled out just a little less than the recommended 3 hours.I poured the sangria into frosty ice-filled glasses and topped off with a splash of citrusy Limonata and a pretty little sprig of herbs. Even the staunchest sangria skeptics were tempted into trying a glass, and soon the pitcher was drained.Next time, I\u2019ll make double.Let\u2019s all make ros\u00e9 sangria:Ros\u00e9 All Day SangriaWe like to think of this refreshing sangria as spa water but with a little buzz!View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titRosePitcher DrinksCocktailSummer DrinksSangriaNever FailRecipes you want to make.
