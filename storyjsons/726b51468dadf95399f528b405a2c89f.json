A $133 steamer was a luxury purchase in his opinion\u2014not really a priority.\u201cIt\u2019s not just a steamer,\u201d I retorted, mildly offended. \u201cIt does everything.\u201dOriginally introduced in Taiwan in the 1960s for just $9, the Tatung steamer is a ubiquitous household item across the island and in the homes of the Taiwanese diaspora around the world. The beauty is in its simplicity and versatility. Unlike the dozen or so buttons on an Instant Pot (What do they all do?!), the Tatung has a single on-off switch, and with that, it can reheat food, cook rice, and push out long, complex braises. My late grandmother used it to make herbal soups and tea; my mom steams fish with it; and some people even use it to disinfect their face masks (?!). My friend Ivy Chen, a cooking instructor here in Taipei, tells me that it\u2019s also quite handy for fermenting yogurt. \u201cIt\u2019s not super precise, but it\u2019s multifunctional\u2014and Taiwanese people love multifunction,\u201d she says.Like a Russian matryoshka doll, it consists of a small pot nestled within a fixed bigger pot. Just pour a couple of cups of water into the outer pot, add your food to the smaller pot inside, and flick the switch. The indirect heat from the steam hovers around 159\u00b0, which is high enough to cook things like steamed fish or braised pork but low enough not to burn anything if left unattended. (See, it\u2019s also a slow cooker. Multifunction.) Take off the lid and the temp will drop to around 108\u00b0\u2014within the ideal range for incubating starter yogurt cultures. When the water in the outer chamber runs out, the steamer turns itself off. Easy peasy. Even a kid could do it.Microwaves or toasters aren\u2019t common here in Taiwan, so generations of college students have been using this steamer instead to fix themselves a quick meal. My friend SueAnn Shiah, a graduate student at National Taiwan University, has one in her dorm room and uses it to make dumplings, pasta, and popcorn from scratch. Making popcorn requires a temperature of 355\u00b0 for the kernels to pop, which is beyond the usual temperature capacity of the steamer. But there is a hack: \u201cPut some oil in the bottom of your inner pot, add kernels, then hold down the on-off lever. Normally, the pot will just click off when it hits a certain temperature, but if you hold the switch down, you can manually override it.\u201dAesthetics-wise, the pots come in quaint monochromatic colors like green, orange, blue, white, or red, though the brand will occasionally push out a limited edition release. I got mine in green because that\u2019s the original, most iconic color\u2014the same version my grandmother had. My mother, though, is a proud owner of a bright pastel pink Hello Kitty steamer, which I\u2019m hoping might one day become a family heirloom.This machine may not have any of the fancy bells, whistles, and timers that most modern multi-cookers have, but that\u2019s really just part of its charm. Truly, sometimes the best gadgets are the simplest ones.Tatung Electric Steamer$143 $120 at Amazon$140 $98 at Wayfair$137 at TS EmporiumExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendToolsequipmentRecipes you want to make.
