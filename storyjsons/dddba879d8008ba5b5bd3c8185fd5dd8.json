As I crossed the street, a bus intercepted my path, slapped with an ad for collagen powder: \u201cLet\u2019s glow, babes.\u201d A few blocks later, I encountered a sandwich board outside a beauty shop that read: \u201cWant a glow? We\u2019ve got a mask for that.\u201d While I waited in line at Whole Foods, I popped open Instagram for a scroll through my feed and happened upon @namvo and her daily dose of #DewyDumplings. Later, I perused the newspaper at a local caf\u00e9 and saw an article on the latest wedding diet trend\u2014a high-fat diet that, you guessed it, gives you a glow. You get my point: We\u2019ve become a culture obsessed with glowing. But why?The surface-level answer, of course, is found in our standards of beauty. As the label on my Kaffe 1668 \u201cGlow\u201d juice reminds me, we\u2019ll do anything \u201cfor youthful skin.\u201d Like it or not, we still live in a society in which having the complexion of a literal baby is a status symbol. Healthy, clear-looking skin also communicates good hygiene and self-maintenance\u2014just ask any acne sufferer about the ridicule and judgment they\u2019ve endured.People have coveted youthful, healthy appearances since the beginning of time, but today\u2019s version of glowing goes deeper, literally. Not that long ago, the words \u201cyou\u2019re glowing\u201d was a compliment reserved for women at very specific life stages: new love, weddings, and pregnancy. It was a signal of feminine energy, of fertility. Now, we\u2019re expected to glow every damn day. It\u2019s the number one indicator of \u201cwellness,\u201d that concept that\u2019s come to mean everything and nothing at all.Year after year, the global wellness industry continues to increase by the billions. It\u2019s invaded just about every other industry from beauty to fitness to medicine to travel. We are all zealously striving for a healthy, well-balanced life; meanwhile, it\u2019s all starting to look like a familiar trap.In 1982, writer and longtime Cosmopolitan editor Helen Gurley Brown came out with her iconic book, Having It All: Love, Success, Sex, Money .\u2009.\u2009. Even if You\u2019re Starting With Nothing. The book is a symbol of the false promise of feminism: that women can raise kids, clean house, go to work, feed the family, and please their partners at the end of the night. Today, the wellness industry tells us we should be meditating, shooting apple cider vinegar, going to yoga, and following our 15-step skincare routine, all before we\u2019ve whipped up our adaptogenic breakfast smoothie. If wellness is to 2018 what \u201chaving it all\u201d was to the \u201980s, then glowing is the modern equivalent of showing up to the potluck with a perfect perm, two well-behaved children, and a croquembouche.Our supplement shelves overfloweth with green powders like these that claim to help you glow.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigAnd like \"having it all,\" chasing the glow is a never-ending pursuit, and an expensive one too, filled with acupuncture appointments, boutique fitness classes, organic food, and a pantry full of potions, powders, and pills. So what\u2019s a modern woman to do? If there\u2019s one lesson we can keep from the stereotypical glow\u2014the love, marriage, and pregnancy kind\u2014it\u2019s that glowing comes from happiness, confidence, and pleasure, not hyaluronic-acid serums, raw food diets, or Instagram filters.And it\u2019s those feelings we\u2019ll have to pursue\u2014not necessarily products\u2014if we want to truly radiate. Happiness is a custom cocktail of our own creation, and we just won\u2019t get there by chasing the version depicted on the side of a bus. We have to figure out what actually lights us up, and I'm not talking about the glare of your smartphone. In a world where there seems to be no end to the barrage of messages about what I should be doing, I find blissful, dewy joy in the things no one seems to care about selling: a walk through the residential streets of the West Village, posting up in a hotel lobby to observe and absorb passersby, a visit to Central Park just as the leaves have changed, complimenting a stranger\u2019s shoe choice on the street, finding a Sweet Dumpling squash at the farmers' market and roasting it when I get home. Interestingly, it\u2019s the things I do intentionally, just for me, that spark connection with something greater. And, bonus: None of these things come with a hefty price tag.As that Roald Dahl saying goes, \u201cIf you have good thoughts, they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely.\u201d It\u2019s a line meant for children, but shouldn\u2019t we all agree?Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSelf CareTrendsRead MoreLifestyleWhy Are We So Obsessed with Making Healthy Desserts?By Zan RomanoffRecipes you want to make.
