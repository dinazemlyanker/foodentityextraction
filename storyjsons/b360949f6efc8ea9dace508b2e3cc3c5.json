It\u2019s not my sole purpose in life. I won\u2019t pretend to be that noble. But the quality of your lunch is something I care about. Which is why I want to tell you about Desk Dip. I know exactly what you\u2019re thinking. What the freaking heck is this gosh darn Desk Dip? It sounds...so cool.I love the enthusiasm. And the curiosity. And for that, I will address your question with pleasure: Desk dip is exactly what you think it is. It\u2019s a dip. That you eat at your desk. For lunch.But it\u2019s also so much more. In a world of sandwiches and salads and predictable office lunch options, Desk Dip is a breath of fresh air. It\u2019s an opportunity to break out of the walls that mainstream lunch culture has built around your work lunch. (If you work in a cubicle, these walls are literal. If not, the walls are metaphorical.) Desk Dip is a new way of thinking. It\u2019s all about having the freedom to choose.When I dip, you dip, we dip.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigThink about it like this: Desk Dip contains multitudes. First, you have to pick a dip that appeals to you. Maybe it\u2019s an eggplant caponata inspired situation. Or maybe a simple, lemony hummus recipe. Or maybe it\u2019s the Desk Dip that I\u2019m really digging at the moment: a super silky, slightly spicy, tiny bit sweet curried coconut peanut number. After you make that call, the options are limitless.Because what you\u2019re dipping into your Desk Dip is where a creative spirit really comes into play. You could just bring some pita chips and call it a day. Or you could bring some crunchy radishes and carrots. And a jammy seven minute egg. And some sliced up rotisserie chicken breast. And a roasted sweet potato. And some blanched string beans. And maybe even some potato chips? It really doesn\u2019t matter. You are the commander of your own destiny. YOU CAN DIP WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DIP.This is a lot to take in. I know. A whole new world, a new perspective. But please, trust me. Take this leap of faith. Make Desk Dip your office lunch, even if it\u2019s only for a day. Try it out. If you don\u2019t enjoy the experience, go back to your reheated baked ziti. But to be quite honest, once you get a taste of the Desk Dip lifestyle, it\u2019s pretty tough to revert back to the old you.Get the recipe:Curried Peanut DipThis creamy, spicy-sweet dip pairs with leftover rotisserie chicken, jammy eggs, cucumber spears, and roasted sweet potatoes for the perfect desk-friendly lunch.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titLunchDipRead MorecultureThe Bon App\u00e9tit Guide to Actually Enjoying Your Lunch at WorkGallery20 SlidesBy The Bon App\u00e9tit StaffRecipes you want to make.
