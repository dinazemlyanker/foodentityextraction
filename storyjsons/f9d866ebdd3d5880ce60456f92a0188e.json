When something's so easy to make that you don't even need one. Welcome to It's That Simple, a column where our staffers talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks that they can make with their eyes closed.Broccoli Delight was born on a night when I came home from work very hungry and without a plan, and my near-empty fridge came through for me.It's also a dish that my teenage son claims is the \u201cbest thing you make.\u201d While this could be construed as an insult considering how many other things I\u2019ve made for him, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s meant as a compliment, and that what he\u2019s getting at is that pan-roasted broccoli florets bound to one another by melted-crispy sheets of cheese never disappoints.To make Broccoli Delight, you need five ingredients, not counting salt: a head of broccoli (cut into florets, with plenty of stem attached), extra-virgin olive oil, aged cheddar cheese, a lemon, and crushed red pepper flakes. Add a generous coating of olive oil to a preheated cast-iron pan over medium-high heat, then add the broccoli (try to arrange the cut sides down), season with salt, and let cook, undisturbed, until the undersides are dark brown and the florets are bright green, 4 to 5 minutes. Toss everything around and let the broccoli cook a few minutes longer, until the new undersides take on some color and the stems are crisp-tender, another 5 minutes or so (but taste one to find out).While that's happening, crumble about 4 ounces of cheddar (or your other favorite melting cheese) into \u00bd\u201d pieces, then sprinkle them over the broccoli. The cheese will immediately melt and some will start to drip down into the spots between the florets and onto the hot surface of the pan. Whatever lands there will bubble and brown into cheese sheets. The rest of the cheese will softly melt onto the florets without getting crispy, and that\u2019s just what you want. One cheese, two textures.When all of the cheese has at least softened and started to melt, and the cheese that\u2019s on the pan is golden brown and bubbling, Broccoli Delight is done. Give it a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes for a little pizazz and serve it with lemon wedges to squeeze over top and you\u2019ve got a winner of a dish. I'm in the habit of making tuna salad to go with Broccoli D., but you don\u2019t have to. It could be a side for any kind of quick protein, or you could just eat the entire batch on its own, by yourself.It\u2019s weird thinking my best recipe work is behind me, but if this is the dish I peak with, I\u2019m okay with it.Broccoli, you're the bomb:Crispy Roasted Broccoli with Tahini SauceHigh heat and the simplest sauce ever make for roasted veggies that feel like a dish, not an afterthought.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimpleBroccoliCheeseCast ironRecipes you want to make.
