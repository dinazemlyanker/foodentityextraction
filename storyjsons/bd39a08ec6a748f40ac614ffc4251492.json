RossJuly 16, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Tim Graham/Getty ImagesFacebookTwitterEmailTrying to explain carbonic maceration is like trying to explain a song you heard on the radio when you have no idea who sang it or what they were singing about or why you even enjoyed it. The song was just upbeat and felt good. Does that sound kind of like the light red wines you\u2019ve been loving with that fruity, poppy quality you can\u2019t quite put your finger on? Yep. That\u2019s carbonic maceration, the pop music of wine fermentations.Like any Top 40 hit, carbonic maceration follows a formula. Most wines are made by picking the grapes, stemming those grapes, crushin\u2019 dem grapes, and then putting the juice in steel fermentation tanks before aging the juice in the winemaker\u2019s vessel of choice (oak, concrete, amphora, etc.). But with carbonic maceration, a winemaker skips stemming and crushing and instead puts full bunches of grapes into steel fermentation tanks that are sealed and filled with carbon dioxide, creating an anaerobic atmosphere without any oxygen. Minus the oxygen, fermentation\u2014yeast eating sugar and producing alcohol\u2014begins inside the individual grapes. Eventually the grapes end up crushing themselves under the weight of the alcohol they are producing. The result is an irresistibly juicy fruit-forward wine with bright acidity, low tannins, and a snap-crackle-pop Rice Krispies texture that is meant to taste fresh and be drunk young.If carbonic maceration rings a bell, then chances are you\u2019ve had a few bottles of Beaujolais. The French region may have popularized the method but confining it to Beaujolais and Gamay would be like saying pop music applies only to the 1950s rock \u2019n\u2019 roll that started the craze. These days Drake can be just as poppy as Ariana Grande. You can get carbonic Cabernet Francs from the Loire, carbonic Valdigui\u00e9 from California, and even carbonic white wines such as Trebbiano from Umbria. It can be used in any region with any grape variety.Wine is constantly evolving though, and the practice of carbonic maceration is no exception. There are also semi-carbonic wines; wines that are put through carbonic maceration for only a short period before going through the more traditional fermentation, typically in steel tanks without carbon dioxide. You might also hear the term whole cluster, which means that full clusters of grapes were fermented but not in a sealed tank pumped with CO\u2082. These wines are exposed to more native yeasts, giving them more complex flavors and a better expression of terroir. I\u2019ve been in cellars where dudes are doing whole cluster in a fiberglass tank covered with only a tarp. Even though carbonic maceration is formulaic, it\u2019s like any other style of winemaking in that a winemaker has tons of options and ways to make that wine unique and their own.Read more about Beaujolais and wine vintages here.\nStephen LewisCan you taste the differences between carbonic, semi-carbonic, and whole cluster wines? It depends. I compared a semi-carbonic Beaujolais Gamay, a fully carbonic California Zinfandel, a whole cluster Juran\u00e7on Noir from Cahors. They each have slight differences based on their variety and region\u2014the Beaujolais Gamay is lighter, the California Zinfandel is punchier, the Cahors Juran\u00e7on is heavier. Whole cluster definitely offers more flavor, but overall these wines are still fruity, poppy, and downright juicy.This is why carbonic maceration, like pop music, has its haters. A lot of people think it\u2019s formulaic and lazy, that it strips the wine of any original expression of terroir and leaves a singular, fruity, juicy, Fun Time USA flavor. And it\u2019s true. Many carbonic wines do taste similar because during fermentation the grapes and their juice are sealed off from their natural environment; whereas pressed grapes and their juice are fermented in open tanks and receive oxygen, native yeast, and other bacteria that can all enhance the wine\u2019s flavor. Carbonic maceration is also a safe way to make wine because you\u2019re less likely to experience flaws from those same outside influences, which circles back to some critics considering it lazy.And I agree. It can be formulaic, and it can be lazy. But here I am, a person who prizes terroir-driven wines whose taste transports me to another place, with three bottles of carbonic wines in front of me and I am not mad about it one bit. Because here\u2019s the deal\u2014carbonic wines are delicious. I want to drink these, I want to share these with friends, and I want to have fun, which is what these wines are for. And just because something is fun doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t good. It\u2019s called pop for a reason, so if you dig it, drink it.Read more: Making Wine With Yoda, Danilo MarcucciMarissa Ross is the author of Wine. All the Time.
