Once you walk inside Nora Gray, you'll feel a calm wash over you, thanks to a lovely hum of conversation, warm candlelight, and your first glass of wine.ORDER THE: pasta! There are only three selections each night and can range from simple local produce tossed with lemony handmade fusilli to ravioli stuffed with duck heart. But to start, get any of these if you see them on the constantly changing menu: a slab of warm focaccia; pesto-and-tomato topped burrata; fluke crudo garnished with potato chips; whichever perfectly dressed salad catches your eye; and the juicy pork chop with braised cabbage, rabbit sausage, white beans, and a pool of au jus. After that, you should still save room for dessert, like the sugar-tossed doughnuts with rhubarb curd, the intensely chocolaty pot de cr\u00e8me, or a fruity ricotta tart.THE VIBE IS:  intimate and welcoming. It feels like home, if your house has sleek black leather booths, a beautiful long wooden bar, romantically dimmed but not-too-dark lights, and handmade pasta readily available. Service is attentive and the staff is all knowledgeable, so make sure to ask them about their favorite dishes. Bonus: Nora Gray is only a seven-minute walk from the Bell Centre, meaning you\u2019ve got a better option than late-night poutine after catching a concert or a Canadiens game.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Tuesday to Saturday 5:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m.\u2014Alyse WhitneyPhoto by Dominique LafondPhoto by Dominique LafondWE ALSO LOVEFoxyA perennially packed wood-fired hangout in GriffintownElenaPizza and natural wines go hand in hand at this Saint-Henri pie shopCaf\u00e9 OlimpicoGet your caffeine fix at this Mile End espresso shopExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
