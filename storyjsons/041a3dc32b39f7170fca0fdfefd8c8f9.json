The Ancestrale wine bar team opened this restaurant by the lakes. It\u2019s fun to bike here in good weather and sit on the waterfront micro-terrace for a few bottles of natural wine and pretty plates that add up to a very nice, pleasantly affordable meal.ORDER THE: tartare; cured Danish mackerel; and anything on the yakitori grill.THE VIBE IS: quietly stylish and always easygoing.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Wednesday to Saturday, from 5:30 p.m. to midnight. Closed Sunday to Tuesday.\u2014Christine MuhlkePhoto by Ditte IsagerPhoto by Ditte IsagerWE ALSO LOVEAncestraleIn Vesterbro, a cool little wine bar (and a relief to your wallet) Restaurant Sch\u00f8nnemannGet the OG Copenhagen experience at this Indre By *sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d* destinationJuno the BakeryFuel up for those canalside bike rides with these outstanding \u00d8sterbro carbsExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
