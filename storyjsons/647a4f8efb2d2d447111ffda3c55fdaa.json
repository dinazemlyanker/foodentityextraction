It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.During a normal spring, the return of chirping birds and fresh produce signal the return of a brighter, kinder season. But this year, when time seems to have stood still, the transition to warm weather was all that, times a million. My hunger for a normal spring morphed into an unnatural craving for rhubarb, which I\u2019ve always loved, but didn\u2019t realize could take on messianic status.Why rhubarb? Well, it confirms by existing that the earth has been rotating this whole time, because it\u2019s one of the earliest spring crops here in the northeast. It\u2019s pink and green, the quintessential spring palette, and it\u2019s pretty to photograph. It can go savory, on account of its sour crunchiness, or sweet and lucious, especially if you cook it with fruit or simmer it with sugar and vanilla. You can serve it with lamb, or make a cocktail out of it. You can play up its crunchiness in a rhubarb salsa. Mostly, I love to make desserts with it: Rhubarb cake. Rhubarb bars. Rhubarb compote.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Throw this sweet, slow-roasted number over ice cream. Thank me later.\nAlex LauBut, rhubarb is a weird fruit. First of all, it\u2019s a vegetable. If you eat it raw, it\u2019s tannic sourness will contort your tongue and squeeze your eyes shut. It can be stringy. It\u2019s hard to know if it\u2019s ripe, since it\u2019s a stalk (nothing to press on, nothing to sniff). It\u2019s not cute like a berry or delicate like a pea shoot\u2014its leaves are poisonous! But, along with spring onions, and pea shoots, rhubarb gives me the mini thrill of having something new to cook with.That\u2019s how the quest began. Seemed simple enough. I wanted it; I needed it. We had a cold, wet spring, and rhubarb was an elusive little rascal. Starting back in April, I visited my local Brooklyn farmer\u2019s market every Saturday to see what was popping, but my trips were less about scoring new produce and more about seeing how the stands had been reconfigured for social distancing, cashless transactions, and safer food handling. I came home feeling the particular kind of alienation that comes from doing something totally familiar in a new and totally unfamiliar way. And on top of that\u2014no rhubarb! Ramps showed up, and hothouse cucumbers, too. May arrived. But the iridescent pink and green stalks were nowhere to be found.I\u2019m coming for you, pie.\nLaura MurrayThe only rhubarb I could find was on my local grocery site, but the price was exorbitant. They were treating it like a rare and precious jewel, but I know for a fact that when rhubarb is truly in season, it grows like crazy! I waited another week. I trotted my masked self back to the market. I snagged little red radishes, big-bulbed ramps, frilly purple lettuces. No rhubarb. It was mid-May. I should have baked strawberry-rhubarb pie by now. At the farmer\u2019s market, there were turrets of asparagus, and everyone was getting very good at staying patient while standing six feet apart in line. I started practicing smizing and loud-small talk with the vendors (to be heard through my mask), but I still pined for rhubarb. A few days later, I made a quick trip by car to pick up a local seafood box from Marlow and Daughters, one of my favorite butchers. (Yes, I was getting fish from the butcher. Things are weird, go with it.) And there, stacked alongside a few other produce offerings, was a crate of Pennsylvania rhubarb. It was perfect: bright pinkish-red, narrow stalks, poisonous leaves trimmed away. That was the day the rhubarb was secured.I\u2019m still waiting on strawberries, but thanks to Pennsylvania, I finally got to make my first rhubarb crisp. It was sweet and sour, sticky from fruit juices, its velvety texture offset by a buttery, oat-studded topping. The whole crisp was gone in a day, but as the warm weather keeps creeping up the coast, home-grown rhubarb will eventually appear at the farmers market, and I have other things I still want to make. I know it\u2019s just rhubarb, but I\u2019m really happy it\u2019s back.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterRhubarbRead MorecookingRhubarb Shrub is Spring in a BottleBy Al CullitoncookingThis Pink Drink Is My Favorite Way to Consume RhubarbBy Alex BeggscookingA Strawberry-Rhubarb Pie Recipe, with Special Guest Star: VodkaBy Alex BeggscookingA Rhubarb Custard Cake Somewhere Between Pudding and HeavenBy Emily SchultzRecipes you want to make.
