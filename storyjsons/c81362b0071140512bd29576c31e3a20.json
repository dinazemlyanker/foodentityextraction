I\u2019m all for pigs in a blanket and other one-bite appetizers, but you have to be able to eat enough of those little snacks to fill up. At parties with passed hors d'oeuvres, that\u2019s often not the case\u2014unless you beef up your appetizer game. And our new recipe for sliders with provolone and balsamic onions does that perfectly.I made these little burgers for a solo dinner, because my story was due and I wasn\u2019t about to host a slider party on a Thursday night. Each patty should be about 4 oz. (\u00bc lbs.) so it fits onto a squishy Martin\u2019s potato dinner roll. They\u2019re chubby little beef sliders that stand at \u00be\" high before cooking; you should barely press the meat together so they don\u2019t toughen up. And then the cheese: Try to find sharp provolone cheese at the deli counter or Italian market and shred it to make a mound of cheese on top of each slider. Provolone has a salty bite that cheddar or American just don\u2019t have, melts well, and pairs better with the balsamic-pickled onions for this Italian twist on beef sliders.Juicy Lucy SlidersMagical mini versions of Juicy Lucys, cheese-filled burgers that hail from Minnesota.View RecipeI love burgers, but let\u2019s focus on the game-changing part of this recipe: BALSAMIC ONIONS. When I read the recipe title, I thought they\u2019d be caramelized onions with balsamic vinegar, which scared me because I always burn my caramelized onions. Fortunately, it was one thinly-sliced red onion mixed with 3 Tbsp. balsamic, 1 tsp. sugar, and a pinch of salt. You let them sit for a few minutes without cooking, and they soften and become more mellow than standard pickled onions. I piled them high on top of the sliders and slid it into a toasted, mayonnaise-slicked roll. Two will do you for a full meal with a grain salad on the side, or if you\u2019re feeling less authentically Italian (like I was that night), boxed mac and cheese.
