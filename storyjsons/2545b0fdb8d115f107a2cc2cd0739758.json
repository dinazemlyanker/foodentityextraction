But I\u2019m going to start by talking about Sahadi\u2019s, where I used to shop weekly, back when I lived a few blocks from the store. Most Saturdays, I\u2019d stop in for bulk bin nuts and dried fruits, spices, and tubs of hummus and labneh. This habit continued for years before I realized that one of the best breakfasts in Brooklyn was sold literally next door. Week after week, I unwittingly walked right past Damascus Bread & Pastry Shop, my hummus blinders on and completely unaware of the tahini bread sold at this beloved Middle Eastern shop on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn.Eventually my then-coworker Belle tipped me off to the 89-year-old Syrian bakery\u2019s tahini bread, a dense, dimpled round with just three ingredients: flour, sugar, and tahini. It has become one of my favorite breakfasts, ideal with a cup of black tea or coffee. It\u2019s lightly sweetened but not super sweet\u2014the nutty sesame flavor still stands out\u2014and rich from the tahini but not a butter bomb. It\u2019s a lot more fun than having oatmeal for breakfast, but it doesn\u2019t feel like eating a full-on dessert at 8 a.m. It has a beautiful dark brown bottom, a product of the pizza oven it gets baked in, and every so often you\u2019ll get a bite where it seems like the tahini wasn\u2019t fully incorporated, like a ribbon of halvah running through it.This still isn\u2019t a story about Sahadi\u2019s, but I do want to encourage you to go there\u2014not (just) for the nuts and fruits and hummus, but also because right next door is Damascus, a wonderful bakery selling the most wonderful tahini bread.Go there: Damascus Bread & Pastry ShopExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendBreadNew York CityRecipes you want to make.
