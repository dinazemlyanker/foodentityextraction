If fennel is not your thing, any shaved crunchy veg will do. Try radishes, carrots, or cucumbers instead.Ingredients4 servings Chicken1\u00bdlb. skinless, boneless chicken thighsKosher salt2garlic cloves3oil-packed anchovy fillets (optional)1red chile (such as Fresno or Holland), seeds removed, coarsely chopped2Tbsp. tomato paste2tsp. finely chopped oregano3Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for grilling2lemons, halvedFennel Salad and Assembly2medium fennel bulbs, tough outer layers removed, halved lengthwise, thinly sliced crosswise1small white onion, very thinly sliced into rounds2Tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar2Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oilKosher salt1Tbsp. toasted white and/or black sesame seedsPreparationChickenStep 1Pat chicken dry and season with salt.

Crunchy, fresh and flavorful. I ended up going with a Korean-style marinade for my chicken and served over rice and it was great along with this salad. I replaced red onion for the white one.NayaraChicago, IL8/24/2021Simple and tasty - perfect for mid-weekAnonymousMiami, FL5/22/2020My favorite go to for a fast impressive dinner.  The combination of the citrus and the brightness of the fennel salad with the salty spicy chicken is fantastic. AnonymousBrooklyn 6/2/2019Yum! This was great. I actually thought the chicken was not that spicy even though the peppers burned my fingers during preparation, but it tasted amazing. The fennel salad was a great side for this and other barbecue.soapnanaChicago7/5/2018My wife doesn't do a lot of heat so I swapped a fire roasted poblano for the fresno and added 1/8 tsp. of smoked paprika to add the smoky finish that a ripe fresno has. The sweetness of the paprika helped with the heat. Wife enjoyed it and said it's a keeper.RE TI RE DMA5/29/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titChicken ThighChickenPoultryChileVegetableFennelOnionSummerFallEasyWeeknight MealsMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeKetoHealthyishGrillingFourth Of JulyMemorial DayLabor DayDinnerRecipes you want to make.
