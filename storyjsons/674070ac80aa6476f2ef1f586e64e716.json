My second, third, and fourth favorite things about the Long Island Bar are eavesdropping on the couple inches away from me, the glow of the neon \u201cNo Dancing\u201d sign reflecting off the terrazzo floor, and the smell of freshly cracked ice and sticky whiskey. The cheese curds I can have at a patio table outside. As for the rest, although my personal pandemic comfort zone is rapidly expanding, I\u2019m not quite ready to return to my favorite type of cocktail bar\u2014one that\u2019s dimly lit, packed with strangers, and hygge like a cozy cave.OddFellows\u2019 Boozy Capsule isn\u2019t a substitute for the bars I love and miss most, but it is a balm of a different sort: ice cream. This limited edition series of pints pays homage to some of the best bars in the world\u2014Mexico City\u2019s Limantour, Barcelona\u2019s Two Schmucks, Sydney\u2019s Maybe Sammy, and New York\u2019s Death & Co, Attaboy, and Long Island Bar. Death & Co\u2019s Buko Gimlet flavor, the pastel green of an after-dinner mint, is a coconut cream sherbet infused with pandan leaf, gin, and Novo Fogo cacha\u00e7a. The La Finca ice cream from Maybe Sammy, which features oloroso sherry, Mr. Black Coffee Liqueur, and gooey nuggets of manuka honey, tastes like a frozen version of the best Vietnamese coffee I\u2019ve ever had. The Long Island Bar\u2019s pint is a tart, juicy riff on a Cosmopolitan, which was developed by the bar\u2019s owner, Toby Cecchini, when he was working at the legendary Odeon. It tastes like pink lemonade and 2002.The cute conceit makes these pints worth recommending, but what makes them worth highly recommending is the quality of the ice cream itself. OddFellows, one of my favorite scoop shops in New York, is the brainchild of Sam Mason, formerly the pastry chef at WD-50. He\u2019s been turning out small-batch flavors like miso cherry and pistachio cardamom caramel since 2013, and in his hands, even bacon, egg, and cheese ice cream is worth lining up for. At $99 for six pints (shipping included), these are definitely a splurge. But think of each pint as a couple of cocktails\u2014which they essentially are, in ice cream form\u2014and consider that you don\u2019t have to tip. Plus, OddFellows is donating 10% of proceeds from the Boozy Capsule to Another Round Another Rally, a nonprofit that aids those in the hospitality sector. May I suggest sending a pack to your best bar crawl buddy for her birthday?The ice creams in the Boozy Capsule do contain alcohol, but a subtle amount\u2014under 5% ABV, which is not so much that they approach frozen marg territory but enough that they\u2019re perfectly scoopable straight from the freezer. If you were feeling moreish, you could, conceivably top a bowl of Attaboy\u2019s Penicillin ice cream with a shot of peaty scotch or float a scoop of the Cosmopolitan in a glass of Cr\u00e9mant. Or do what I do\u2014dim the lights, turn on a little background noise, sidle up real close to your partner or roommate or dog, and stick a spoon straight into the pint.Photo by Isa Zapata, food styling by Micah MortonOddFellows' The Boozy Capsule Ice Cream (6 Pints)$119 $99 at GoldbellyExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendSummerRecipes you want to make.
