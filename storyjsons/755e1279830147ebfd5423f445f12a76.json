In the Martinez household, every family member has a task: Claudia\u2019s dad or grandmother always prepares the guiso, the tender shredded chicken and beef stew that comprises the bulk of the filling. One person slicks scoops of vibrant orange achiote-stained masa dough onto banana leaves, then passes them around the table to get filled. Claudia\u2019s grandma adds a spoonful of guiso; Claudia adds olives and capers; her sister adds a few raisins. Finally, each hallaca gets wrapped up in the fragrant leaves and tied with twine like a tiny present, ready to boil for a late Christmas Eve dinner. The Martinez family usually makes 100 at a time; this scaled-down version of their recipe makes just under 20, enough for a big dinner plus leftovers you can freeze for another day. If you find yourself with leftover masa and stew, do as the Martinezes do: Make arepas with guiso and fried eggs for breakfast on Christmas Day. (If you\u2019re in Atlanta in the days leading up to Christmas Eve, pick up hallacas at Caf\u00e9 Claudia, the pop-up Martinez runs out of the Hotel Clermont.)Banana leaves give a floral and grassy flavor to the hallacas, you can buy them either fresh or frozen at Latin and Asian markets. You can use parchment paper instead, but the outcome won\u2019t be as complex.IngredientsMakes about 18Guiso1\u00bdcups extra-virgin olive oil3Tbsp. plus 1\u00bd tsp. achiote (annatto) seeds2\u00bdlb. boneless beef chuck roast2\u00bdlb. skinless, boneless chicken breasts1Tbsp.

Diamond Crystal or 1 Tbsp. plus \u00bd tsp. kosher saltassembly31-lb. packages fresh or frozen, thawed banana or plantain leaves\u00bccup extra-virgin olive oil\u00bdcup drained capers\u00bdcup pitted green olives\u00bdcup raisinsPreparationGuisoStep 1Cook oil and achiote seeds in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until oil turns deep orange, about 10 minutes. Strain into a heatproof jar and let cool. Measure out \u00bd cup achiote oil for making filling; set remaining 1 cup oil aside for making dough.Step 2Bring beef, chicken, 1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1\u00be tsp. Morton kosher salt, and 12 cups water to a boil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and let simmer until cooked through, about 30 minutes. Transfer beef and chicken to a cutting board and let sit until cool enough to handle. Pour 8 cups cooking liquid into a heatproof pitcher or large measuring glass; set aside. Discard any extra liquid.Step 3Cut beef and chicken into \u2153\" cubes; place back into pot (cooking the meat before you chop it means that you can cut the pieces finer and more evenly). Blend tomatoes, garlic, and tomato paste in a blender until smooth; scrape pur\u00e9e into pot with meat. Blend onion, red and green bell peppers, scallions, cilantro, and \u00bd cup reserved cooking liquid in blender until smooth and add to pot. Add brown sugar and \u00bd cup reserved achiote oil. Pour in remaining 7\u00bd cups reserved cooking liquid. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until meat is tender and liquid is slightly reduced, about 40 minutes. Drain meat in a colander, season lightly with salt, and let cool.DoughStep 4Meanwhile, mix cornmeal, salt, reserved 1 cup achiote oil, and 8 cups water in a large bowl with your hands until dough is smooth, spreadable, and no large lumps remain, 5\u20137 minutes. Press a sheet of plastic wrap or parchment paper directly onto surface of dough; let rest at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.AssemblyStep 5Wash and pat banana leaves dry. Carefully remove any center stems with kitchen shears, avoiding breaking through the leaf, then cut into 14x10\" rectangles. Mix oil and 1 cup water in a medium bowl (it needs to be big enough to dip your hands into). This will help to keep the dough from sticking to your hands. Working one at a time, place a banana leaf on a surface so the veins in the leaves run horizontally. Dipping your hands in oil mixture as you work, place \u00be cup dough in center of leaf and spread out with your fingers into a \u215b\"-thick rectangle, leaving a 1\" border near the vertical edges and a space on both horizontal edges. Place \u00be cup guiso into center of dough. Top with 5 capers, 2 olives, and 8 raisins.ChevronChevronStep 6Take top and bottom edges of leaf and bring up toward each other so edges of dough meet and enclose filling. Pull both sides of banana leaf together snugly toward the upper edge of hallaca to seal and fold over toward you to make a tube. Fold remaining 2 side ends toward the center to make a small package.ChevronChevronStep 7Place package, fold side down, on another banana leaf and wrap up again. Wrap once more in a third leaf to hold everything together, then tie closed with kitchen twine. (Make sure package is compact, the leaves are not ripped, and hallaca is not leaking.) Repeat with remaining dough, filling, and banana leaves.ChevronChevronStep 8Place as many hallacas as will fit into a clean large pot, pour in water to cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, turning hallacas halfway through, until plumped and firm, about 35 minutes. Repeat with remaining hallacas.Do ahead: Hallacas can be made 1 week ahead. Let cool, then cover and chill, or freeze up to 3 months. To reheat, cook in a pot of simmering water (make sure hallacas are submerged), partially covered, until warmed through, 10\u201315 minutes if chilled, 25\u201330 minutes if frozen.How would you rate Hallacas?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (9)Back to TopTriangleI\u2019m not sure if I real Venezuelan tried this recipe before reviewing but this wasn\u2019t it. Definitely wasn\u2019t a 5star recipe. The sauce had a tinge too much sweetness and not enough savory/ salty. Wasn\u2019t enjoyable as it should have been. The writer should revisit the measurements for the broth to ensure they are correct. Disappointed with the result.AnonymousMiami,Fl12/31/2021Caracas-based family, mine. Guiso was similar except no coriander. Nobody older survives in our family to explain if leaving out the coriander happened here in the states bc it was not available in the 1900\u2019s when they came over.\nYes to tomatoes and adding cumin to the guiso.\nAlso we add hard boiled egg wedges, but everyone has a favourite combination of extras so our process became [stuff-roll-tie-add initials].Maria Bolet EngLong Island, NY7/7/2021I don't believe a 2 1/2 lb. boneless beef chuck roast would be tender after cooking for 30 minutes.AnonymousSan Francisco, Ca.3/24/2021Very good! A commitment for sure, but the end result was tasty. Loved doing something really different. A. BaerHarrisburg, PA1/2/2021Certainly a labor of love but worth it in the end! Added a few more spices to the guiso but otherwise no changes. Delicious!!katieDallas12/25/2020Hallacas do not have tomatoes, as it would give them an acid taste!nelson castellanosLisbon, Portugal12/23/2020Thanks so much for bringing our dearest culinary tradition to your magazine. I am from eastern Venezuela and I can tell every household has a different recipe. In my house, I don\u2019t use tomato or cilantro, instead we use an endemic kind of chilli, potatos, pickles vegetables and hard boiled eggs.

AnonymousBarcelona, Venezuela12/23/2020Great recipe.....very authentic, and very different from the Trinidadian version that is an adaptation of Hallacas clearly...\nTrinidad, being the chip off the mainland of Venezuela, our cuisine has evolved from a few 100 years of migration of many people to our tiny island.\n\nSo...its fantastic ...to finally read this version. We dont tend to use sofrito, in our cooking..but  their are so many other similarities....\n\nAnd...this dish know by the name pastelle here, has always been a great family tradition...\nThough...many will not be taught this as generations change.\nI'm keen to use some aspects of this recipe going forward...and say...thank you to your team for another great recipe. \n\n\nFarah Gopaul Trinidad, West Indies12/2/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titVenezuelanSouth AmericanLatin AmericanCornmealFlourMainDairy-FreeNut-FreeGluten-FreeChristmasDinnerRecipes you want to make.
