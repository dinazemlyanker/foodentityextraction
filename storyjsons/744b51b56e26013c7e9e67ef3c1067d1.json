Rick\u2019s recipe also includes a layer of saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and poblanos topped with cheese for a substantive yet meat-free meal; you could also add chorizo, refried beans, queso fresco, and/or guacamole. Serve for breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Diamond Crystal or 1\u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt, divided, plus more1\u00bdtsp. (or more) fresh lime juice8oz. button mushrooms2medium poblano chiles or any color bell peppers2garlic cloves6oz. white cheddar5Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided4large eggs4tostadasPreparationStep 1Make the salsa ranchera: Remove stem from 1 serrano chile (only use \u00bd if you don\u2019t want your salsa spicy) and halve lengthwise. Heat a medium skillet, preferably cast iron, over high until you see wisps of smoke, about 2 minutes. Arrange serrano chile, skin side down, on one side of pan and add 16 oz. cherry tomatoes. Cook, leaving chile undisturbed and occasionally tossing tomatoes, until charred, 6\u20138 minutes. It is going to get a little smoky so turn on the vent and open a window. Transfer serrano chile and tomatoes to a blender or food processor. Reserve skillet.Step 2Add \u00bc onion, \u00bc cup cilantro leaves with tender stems, and 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt to blender and blend on low speed (or pulse if using a food processor) until vegetables are broken up, about 30 seconds. Increase speed to medium-low and pur\u00e9e until salsa is almost smooth but some chunks remain. Don\u2019t be tempted to blend on high or you will incorporate air into the salsa and it will look and taste more like a smoothie than a salsa. Transfer to a medium bowl and stir in 1\u00bd tsp. fresh lime juice. Taste and season with more salt and add more lime juice if needed. Set aside until ready to serve.Step 3Using a paper towel, brush off dirt from 8 oz. button mushrooms. Trim woody stems and discard. Cut mushrooms into quarters. Cut 2 medium poblano chiles or any color bell peppers in half lengthwise and remove stems, seeds, and ribs. Cut chiles into long thin strips about \u00bc\" thick. Use the side of a chef\u2019s knife to lightly smash 2 garlic cloves, then peel and thinly slice. Grate 6 oz. white cheddar on the large holes of a box grater.Step 4Head over to the stove with all of your prep work (gathering it on a rimmed baking sheet will make this easy!). Now, you\u2019re ready to make the mushroom topping. Wipe out reserved skillet with a paper towel and heat 3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil over medium-high. Arrange mushrooms in a single layer in skillet and cook, undisturbed, until brown underneath, about 3 minutes. Give mushrooms a toss and season with 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt. Continue to cook, tossing occasionally, until deep golden brown all over, 5\u20137 minutes longer. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a small bowl, leaving oil behind.Step 5Arrange poblano chiles in an even layer in same skillet and cook, undisturbed, until browned underneath, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and season with 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt. Cook, tossing occasionally, until lightly browned all over, 5\u20137 minutes longer. Add 3 Tbsp. water and cook, stirring occasionally, until water has evaporated, about 2 minutes. The water will soften the chiles and pull up all those tasty brown bits from the bottom of the pan.Step 6Add mushrooms with any accumulated juices back to pan and toss until evenly distributed. Sprinkle cheese over in an even layer and remove skillet from heat. Cover (a baking sheet works great if you don\u2019t have a lid that will work) and let sit 5 minutes for cheese to melt.Step 7You are almost there; you just need to cook the eggs. Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Crack 4 large eggs into skillet, leaving space around each one, and cook until whites are set and edges are crisp, about 4 minutes. Season with salt.Step 8To serve, spoon cheesy mushroom mixture onto 4 tostadas, dividing evenly, and top each with an egg, then reserved salsa and some cilantro.How would you rate Huevos Rancheros con Rajas y Champi\u00f1ones?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleThis recipe is phenomenal! I didn\u2019t have the extra ingredients for the mushroom and poblano mixture (next time!!) but I was looking for an authentic huevos rancheros recipe and I knew anything by Rick would be perfect and he didn\u2019t disappoint. I\u2019ve never had this dish before so this clear, well explained recipe on how to put it all together was so helpful! The salsa was spicy and flavourful and combined with the eggs and tostadas, a truly delightful first adventure into this awesome dish! Thanks!!
