It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.The whole point of cooking is to transform an ingredient into a better, more delicious version of itself. That is true if you slice, season, and saut\u00e9 an eggplant before eating it, because it is inedible raw, and it is also true if you put a little salt on a fresh cucumber, which even a child knows will make it taste better.Sure, I suppose you could do nothing to the season\u2019s first sugar snap peas, aside from pulling off their wispy strings before crunching them up. I\u2019ve even skipped that detail out of necessity when snacking on them while driving, and I didn\u2019t mind the extra fiber. But you could also honor the sugar snap peas by dressing them up a little, just like the half-assed application of bronzer I subject myself to before leaving the house on the weekend. Like \u201cbarely there makeup,\u201d the best kind of cooking is when you do very little but feel like you\u2019ve done something brilliant and magical, which is exactly what\u2019s going on in this sugar snap pea salad.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!To be clear, there\u2019s no cooking involved. The first step is to buy great sugar snap peas, which should have smooth, shiny pods, perky stems, and no signs of shriveling or browning anywhere. Run your finger over them\u2014the pod should be taut and unblemished and the peas should feel like they\u2019re fitting snugly inside\u2014you know, snug as a bug in a rug. Sort around in the bin before buying, if you must, but don\u2019t be annoying about it. String them by pulling up from the tail end and unzipping the thin floss that runs along their top side (straight side) to the stem end. Then cut the stringless sugar snaps on an angle into thin slices, and accept that some of their tender inner peas will fall out as you go. The more textures and shapes, the better. Scoop them into a little bowl and season with olive oil, lemon, and salt.Then you make a creamy, tangy dressing with buttermilk, yogurt, a little garlic, and lemon juice. If you happen to have yogurt but no buttermilk, you could thin it with regular milk or even water. If you don\u2019t have a lemon, use rice vinegar or white wine vinegar. If, on the other hand, you have buttermilk but no yogurt, amp up the buttermilk with some olive oil for richness and body. Omit the garlic and use a sliced scallion. There are no reasons not to make the dressing\u2014that\u2019s all I\u2019m trying to say. The goal is something cooling and zippy to go with the sweet and crunchy peas. Pile the peas on top of the dressing and season everything together with a little more salt and a few cranks of black pepper. Were the peas beautiful before you took these extra steps? Sure. Are they a bewitching, beguiling, more captivating version of themselves now? Yes. But if anyone asks, I\u2019m telling them it\u2019s a natural glow.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterSpring SidesSugar Snap PeaRead MorecookingGreen Minestrone Is Here to Justify Your Spring Farmers' Market SplurgeBy Aliza AbarbanelcookingThis Recipe Wants You to Know That Meatballs Are Totally Appropriate for SpringBy Amanda ShapirocookingThis Turmeric Yogurt Dip Is a Great Excuse to Load Up on Spring ProduceBy Seamus MullenRecipes you want to make.
