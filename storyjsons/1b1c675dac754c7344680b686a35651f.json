Hill, courtesy of Alfred A. KnopfFacebookTwitterEmailGo back in time with us to 1971, the year that changed the way we eat forever.Before I met Edna Lewis, I thought the South was something to recover from. I was eager to put my Alabama childhood behind me. Eager to forget summers spent picking peas in fields of hard red clay and cutting okra at dawn and dusk to escape punishing heat. And even though my Grandmaw Peacock\u2019s slow-stewed-till-sticky chicken and rice (made with hens she raised and plucked herself) remains one of the most transcendent dishes I have ever been blessed to eat, I was eager to escape her too. Uneducated and poor, my grandmother was a struggling sharecropper\u2019s wife whose only bathroom for much of my childhood was an outhouse.Southern cooking and culture were stereotyped punchlines for most of the 20th century: overcooked, lard-laced and \u201cless than,\u201d in need of gussying up. Even the most staunchly proud Southerners, when extolling with misty-eyed fervor the glory of their mother or grandmother\u2019s hot water corn pone, felt the need to qualify their appraisal with some version of, \u201cNow she wasn\u2019t any fancy cook, she was just a good ol\u2019 Southern cook.\u201dPhoto by John T. HillI was in second grade in 1971, when Miss Lewis finished writing the eponymous first cookbook she\u2019d publish the following year. But I didn\u2019t meet her until 1989. I was 26, working as a chef in Atlanta for the Governor of Georgia. She was 73, had just published her third book, and was head chef at the iconic Gage & Tollner in Brooklyn.Nervous and eager to make an impression on this majestic woman, I told her about my job. \u201cOh, a chef,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere did you go to cooking school?\u201d My face flushed. I hadn\u2019t, and I was embarrassed. \u201cGreat,\u201d she replied. \u201cLet\u2019s go have a drink!\u201dFor the next half hour, we sipped mint juleps and talked nonstop. She spoke about the flavor and importance of vegetables grown from open-pollinated seed, her love of quail, wild blackberries, and turtle soup. All was going well until I told her my dream of moving to Italy to learn about Italian cooking. I\u2019d expected encouragement, but instead she grew serious. \u201cI love Italian food too,\u201d she said, \u201cbut you should really learn about your own cooking before running off to study someone else\u2019s.\u201dChastised and confused, my face burned.A year later Miss Lewis returned to Atlanta for a food festival and I was asked to be her assistant. For four days we shopped and cooked together as our friendship slowly took hold. Enough so that a few months later she invited me to visit her in Manhattan.There, we spent an entire day wandering Miss Lewis\u2019s favorite haunts. It was magical, but I began to notice a pattern: the party crasher that was Miss Lewis\u2019 steely obsession with Southern food. Drinking coffee at the original Dean & DeLuca\u2019s, she\u2019d say, \u201cIt\u2019s real good, but no better than my grandfather\u2019s.\u201d Eating duck confit at Gotham Bar & Grill, she\u2019d say, \u201cWell, duck is real Southern.\u201d Every sublime culinary experience New York could offer would be interrupted with some kind of Southern comparison or connection.Initially, I felt unable to make peace with her dogged expectation of the kind of chef that I should be. Cooking was supposed to be my escape from where I\u2019d come from, and I wasn\u2019t interested in going back.But the next day, I was struck with a vivid realization, one that came on strong, like some kind of religious conversion, the blind given sight: The things I admired about Italian cooking\u2014a cuisine built upon the short distance from field to table, where ingredients are always fresh and seasonal\u2014had nothing on my father and his edict that okra be cut twice a day, at dawn and dusk, and corn eaten within hours of harvest or not at all.I was relying on cooking as a way to get somewhere else, but what Miss Lewis was trying to show me was that I had no reason to apologize for where I already was. In her written accounts of the people, recipes, rituals, and landscape of her early childhood in Freetown, Virginia\u2014a small settlement founded at the end of the Civil War by her formerly enslaved grandfather\u2014she found no shame or need to escape. Only integrity, dignity, and value in humble rural culture.From that moment on, I dedicated my career to the food of the American South. At my restaurants in Atlanta, Horseradish Grill and then Watershed, there was no gussying up\u2014only a distillation of the dishes we both loved: buttermilk biscuits, bread-and-butter pickles, and of course, roast duck. For 17 years, our friendship continued to grow; she eventually moved to Atlanta, where we lived together for the last seven years of her life. Miss Lewis saw my essence and helped me distill it, even when I didn\u2019t realize what it was.One day, still early in this journey of self-acceptance and understanding, I had to make a cake for a magazine spread. After deciding to make one inspired by my Grandmaw Peacock\u2019s 15-layer caramel cake with creamy boiled chocolate frosting, I FedExed a slice to New York to get Miss Lewis\u2019s opinion.She called me back the next day. \u201cI only have one suggestion to make,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t change a thing.\u201dScott Peacock is a James Beard awarded chef and co-author with Edna Lewis of the best-selling cookbook, The Gift of Southern Cooking. He lives in Marion, Alabama, where he hosts private cooking explorations of the Southern culinary canon, including his celebrated Biscuit Experiences.Explore Bon App\u00e9titFirst PersonPeopleRecipes you want to make.
