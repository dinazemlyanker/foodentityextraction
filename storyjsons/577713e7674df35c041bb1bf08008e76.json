Across Asian cuisines potatoes are frequently enjoyed with a bowl of rice: There\u2019s the Tibetan dish alu sipsip, which features shredded potatoes stir-fried with green peppers; the homestyle Korean banchan gamja bokkeum, a similar dish of pan-fried potato strips; and there are myriad Indian stir-fried potato dishes.This recipe is based on the Sichuan dish qiang chao tu dou si, shredded potatoes stir-fried with chiles and Sichuan peppercorns and finished with sharp black vinegar (though it\u2019s worth noting that stir-fried potatoes in various preparations are eaten throughout China). It may sound counterintuitive to talk about crisp-tender potatoes, but that\u2019s exactly the result you're looking for here. Stir-frying the potato strips will temper their raw bite, but they should retain some defined crunch. Slice the potatoes as uniformly as possible to ensure they cook evenly and give them a quick soak to wash away some of the starch to encourage crisp sticks rather than gluey ones. This dish can be made with any type of large potato\u2014quick cooking at high heat means that even starchy potatoes like russets won\u2019t fall apart.\" \u2014Hetty McKinnonAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Morton kosher saltSmall handful of cilantro leaves with tender stemsSteamed white rice (for serving)PreparationStep 1Cut a thin slice from base of each potato. Stand potatoes on flat bases and slice lengthwise into \u215b\"-thick planks. Working with a few planks at a time, stack potatoes and slice into long \u215b\"-thick matchsticks. (Alternatively, use a mandoline fitted with the julienne attachment.) Place in a large bowl and pour in cold water to cover; let soak 10 minutes. Swish potatoes around with your hands to release some starch, then drain well and pat dry.Step 2Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high. Cook chiles and Sichuan peppercorns, stirring constantly, until aromatic, about 1 minute. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 20 seconds. Immediately add potatoes; cook, tossing constantly, until potatoes are wilted and crisp-tender but not browned, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in scallions, vinegar, and salt.Step 3Transfer stir-fry to a plate and top with cilantro.
