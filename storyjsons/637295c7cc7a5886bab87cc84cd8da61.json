While many other methods count on pockets of butter and an angel\u2019s touch for pull-apart flakiness, we weren't willing to leave it to chance. Our simple folding technique manually multiplies the number of layers for guaranteed, no-risk success. And the sour cream isn\u2019t just a gimmick. Used in place of the more typical cream or buttermilk, it adds rich, tangy flavor, and acidity that helps make the biscuits incredibly light and tender. These are at their peak when they\u2019re warm out of the oven. Plan accordingly. Questions?

Morton kosher salt, 1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper, 1\u00be tsp. baking powder, \u00bd tsp. baking soda, 1\u00bc tsp. sugar, and 2\u00bd cups (313 g) all-purpose flour in a large bowl to combine.Step 3Cut remaining 10 Tbsp. chilled unsalted butter into \u00bd\u201d pieces. Add to dry ingredients and toss to coat. Using your hands, work butter into dry ingredients, smashing it between your fingers and flattening it between your palm until there are lots of thin shards and pea-size bits. Add reserved scallions and toss to evenly distribute.Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 4Create a well in the center of mixture and add 1\u00bc cups sour cream to the center. Using a fork and working in circles, mix until large shaggy clumps form. If your bowl is wide enough, fold dough over itself a couple of times inside it until it comes together.Step 5Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead once or twice until it comes together; flour your hands if needed. If there are any loose bits, add them to center of dough and knead once more to incorporate.Step 6Pat dough into an 8x4\u201d rectangle about 1\u201d thick.Step 7Working from a short side, fold dough in thirds as you would a letter. It doesn\u2019t need to overlap perfectly. Pat dough into another 8x4\u201d rectangle, then fold dough in thirds like a letter one more time. (You'll have done the folding procedure two times total.) Pat dough back into an 8x4\u201d rectangle and straighten up with your hands and/or your bench scraper. (This folding method is what will create those nice flaky layers in your final biscuits.)Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 8Cut rectangle in half lengthwise, then cut each half crosswise into 4 squares for a total of 8 biscuits.Step 9Transfer biscuits to prepared baking sheet.

Used to love watching her. I add grated cheddar and today, straight buttermilk; have also added greek yogurt and that was terrific, too. Tonight serving with homemade French lentil soup. So Good!\nJo-Ann in NYCNYC10/17/2021Delicious! I closely followed the recipe and found it slack, so I did have to add a bit more flour in, but otherwise the recipe is perfect. I got lots of compliments and requests for them again. A fantastic savory recipe! SuzMontana10/9/2021AMAZING! The best biscuit recipe I\u2019ve ever used. Cut it in half for the 2 of us and it was flaky, soft and absolutely delicious. 18 minutes was perfect on convection. Thanks, Molly! This will be the keeper forever! Rebecca Youngstown, OH8/26/2021These biscuits are the bomb!  Easy to make, tall and fluffy with amazing flavor.  Yes to sprinkling Maldon salt on top after brushing on the butter.  Yum!WendieOakand CA8/15/2021Easy recipe, impressive results. Would work with chives or other herbs \u2026 thinking some chunks of sundried tomatoes would be yummy too. But just as is, these are spectacular and fairly quick to make. Bengali Cowgirl Austin TX7/24/2021I've made this many times, and it's a banger. Very easy to make and to eat :) Laura FariaMontreal, QC7/8/2021I watched Molly and her Father bake these biscuits together via Zoom. \nThe biscuits really deliver on the sour cream and onion flavor (I only used 3 green onion shoots). Hefty, but layered biscuits that went well with sage sausage gravy and eggs I made for my son and I. I am excited to make them again, but pair them with some thin broth based soup on a cold day. Really delicious with more butter and salt slathered on the interior as Molly recommended. Thanks for sharing Air_Rick_SightsEugene, Oregon5/8/2021I did a bad job making these and they still turned out pretty great! But don't make the mistake I did: make sure your butter is CHILLED. I left mine out of the fridge for about half an hour and I think it melted into the flour a bit too much, which resulted in slouchy/flatter biscuits without much rise or layers. My dough was also way wetter than pictured \u2013 not sure if that was due to the melting butter but it seemed like too much sour cream. I baked these in my convection oven without altering the temp for 18 minutes and they were a little undercooked inside. I also used salted butter and didn't add any of the salt and the saltiness was perfect. Next time I would try with fully chilled butter, a tiny bit less sour cream, and closer to 20 minutes' baking time. Considering all my mistakes, these were still amazing!AnonymousOttawa, ON4/6/2021Best biscuit recipe ever (I am 66 so have a lot of miles of biscuit dough behind me). The dough was a tad crumbly (correction - very crumbly) but I just worked with it. Flaky, yummy biscuits. \n\nThe third time I made these I melted the butter in a small skillet. I took each cuboidal biscuit  and rolled it in teh melted butter. Much easier than brushing (for me anyway).  \n\nFourth time I realized somoeone helped themselves to my sour cream. I used greek yogurt.  Still good!\n\nOzark HIkerGreenfield MO3/26/2021The recipie is wonderful, but it would be helpful to included weights for the butter - the butter for the dough should weigh 141 grms.ScottBrandon, MB3/20/2021Easy AND delicious!!PrismdsfMatlacha, FL3/12/2021Finally a biscuit that doesn't have to be rolled out!  So I can't review because I haven't actually made it but I am very excited to try and can't wait - thank you!AnonymousCentral IL2/13/2021So delicious and very doable! I added some shredded cheddar cheese and loved the flavor. These biscuits are great for brunch or really any time! Allison HamffTexas1/27/2021Outstanding biscuits. I cheated and pulsed in food processor until just coming together, then finish with handsAnonymousSeattle 1/24/2021I made these GF/vegan with Namaste flour, earth balance for butter, and forager dairy free sour cream. Amazing! I used about 1/4 cup less sour cream than the recipe called for because my dough was really wet, and the end product did come out a bit dry (but with GF flour, the lamination worked which I haven\u2019t been successful with before!). Next time I think I\u2019d use the full amount of sour cream and increase my flour by 1/8 to 1/4 cup, or try a different flour blend (I think the flour blend from GF artisan bread in 5 minutes a day would better than namaste blend in this recipe for celiacs looking to try this out). 100% would recommend.AnonymousSt Paul, MN1/11/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titBiscuitSouthernAmericanScallionOnionVegetableSideNut-FreeVegetarianBakingBreakfastBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
