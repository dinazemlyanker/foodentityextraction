This recipe calls for peperoncini, but most pickle-y things (cornichons, olives, that jar of dilly beans you've had for years) will work just as well.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Jammy eggs (plain/straight; 7 minutes, exactly, at a boil; then into cold water) are a regular in this place; so are deviled eggs (but conventionally, with a little more prep: yolks out; mashed, with mayonnaise 'n' relish 'n' stuff, and all the rest). Tis  a good, in-between, maybe just a tad less hassle.  worth a try. Hell, who doesn't like deviled (or, jammy) eggs?  Only active communists.AnonymousMoskva6/19/2021Looks good....and this form of protein hit is the way I\u2019m eating these days rather than full on plate.Sharon WrightMontreal4/1/2021Finally got around to trying this recipe and it did not disappoint! It was super easy to make and delicious! I subbed in Chicago-style hot giardiniera for the peperoncini and it worked super well! I will definitely be making this again. Becca P.Chicago, IL 12/13/2020love the idea of this recipe and will try it soon, but where is the aliloi? \ncoronaburgspain9/7/2020Great recipe. Soooo much better than your grandmother's run of the mill deviled eggs. Will definitely keep in the summertime bbq party menu rotation. Orange, CA6/10/2020I liked this. The yolk was perfectly jammy, and the sauce and condiments went together perfectly!AnonymousColumbia, SC1/11/2020I absolutely love this recipe. I've made it several times and it's one of my favorite things to serve as an appetizer. The boiling time + ice bath method haven't failed me yet in terms of achieving the perfect texture. Honestly, sometimes, if I don't want to go to the trouble of boiling eggs, I'll put the toppings on a fried egg or scrambled eggs and that's delicious too.Cecilia HandyAustin Texas12/20/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titEggQuickEasy5 Ingredients or FewerSnackStarterVegetarianNut-FreeGluten-FreeKetoEasterPassoverBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
