When something\u2019s so easy to make that you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.Scabby knees from falling over while playing tipsy mini golf. Sunburnt skin flaking like desiccated coconut. Ninety percent humidity and three-digit temperatures. These are all things that I bid good riddance to come leafy-perfect-snuggly fall\u2014my favorite season in the Northeast. But there is one summer thing, every late September, that I grip on to like a rogue boogie board in the whitewash: ripe and creamy red pepper pasta.The sauce is the most versatile, delicious, and kinda impressive condiment I make (at least weekly) during the months when those sweet, crunchy bulbs are ripe for the cookin\u2019. Slow roasted red peppers and onions are blitzed in a blender with fresh herbs before being tossed with curly cavatappi. The pasta dish is my favorite way to eat this sauce\u2014glossy noods in rich, velvety goodness\u2014but any leftovers make for a fun and fancy bottom-of-the-plate swoosh upon which to serve buttery white fish, grilled lamb chops, or roasted broccoli.But, as I transition from T-shirts to turtlenecks and the farmers market is all pumpkins and cider, it feels wrong to buy those season-defying tricolor pepper packets from the supermarket. So I\u2019ll head over to the canned-everything aisle instead, where jewel-toned pickles and preserves twinkle away under fluorescent light. With just a few heavy-hitting pantry staples\u2014anchovies, sun-dried tomatoes, nut butter, and charred-at-their-peak peppers\u2014I can re-create my favorite summer pasta sauce in a matter of literal minutes. No oven (and no special summer-only produce) necessary!Here\u2019s how to make it:Boil 1 lb. pasta\u2014like cavatappi, fusilli, or reginetti; anything short and funky that the sauce will stick to\u2014in salted water for a minute less than the instructions recommend. Drain and reserve about two cups pasta cooking water.Strain the liquid from a 16-oz. jar of roasted red peppers. (Note: With this being the main ingredient, quality is key here. Opt for whole red peppers with visible signs of char, like Divina\u2019s.) Add the peppers to a blender with 4 Tbsp. cashew butter (or almond if you can\u2019t get it/don\u2019t want to hand over your life savings); 7 oil-packed sun-dried tomato pieces (plus 2 Tbsp. oil); 4 anchovies; \u00bd oz. fresh basil leaves (about a handful); 1 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes; 2 garlic cloves; and 1 cup pasta water. (If you want to make sauce without pasta, you can use tap water here instead.) Blend on high until the sauce is smooth. Add kosher salt and black pepper to taste.Return your cooked pasta to the pot you boiled it in and pour in about half of the blender sauce. Keep adding glugs until each noodle is fully slicked. Turn the burner on to low heat, add \u00bd cup pasta water, and stir gently until it\u2019s mostly evaporated. Add \u00bd cup grated Parmesan and another \u00bd cup pasta water, then keep stirring to combine. The cheese should be fully incorporated and the sauce clinging to the pasta. Store any leftover sauce in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week.For me, a pile of red pepper pasta and a glass of Tempranillo needs nothing or no one, but if you\u2019re hankering for a salad, simple, vinegary greens are the perfect sidekick. Thanks to jarred peppers, this summery favorite never goes out of style. Neither do my turtlenecks.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimplecookingRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
