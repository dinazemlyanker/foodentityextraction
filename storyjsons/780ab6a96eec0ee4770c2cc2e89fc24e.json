See our past recommendations here!I struggle with the bounty of farmers market day. On the plus side: millions of peaches, peaches for me! On the negative: Where do I put them? Usually the answer is stacked precariously in all the medium-to-large-size bowls that I own. This one for tomatoes, that one for stone fruit. Come evening, I\u2019m eager to make a panzanella salad or peach cobbler...only to find that all suitable vessels are occupied.This is why I\u2019m making the argument for a dedicated produce-storage bowl\u2014one large enough to handle a robust farmers market haul and attractive enough to live permanently on your counter. French ceramics company Emile Henry makes just such a \u201cgrande coupe de conservation\u201d\u2014a 14-inch-wide ceramic bowl with a cork lid shaped like an enormous ashtray. The bowl itself, which is ventilated by three discrete holes in the bottom, holds root vegetables and not-quite-ripe fruit that prefer to be stored in darkness, while the lid is large enough to showcase a fruit display that would make a Dutch master weep.The choice in materials goes beyond the cosmetic. Cork is largely composed of a waxy substance called suberin, which has antifungal properties, doesn\u2019t absorb moisture, and repels fruit flies; French grandmothers have been known to toss a handful of wine corks into their fruit bowls for this very reason. Cork and ceramic are also excellent insulators, keeping onions and garlic stored below at a consistent temperature.At $140, this bowl is definitely an investment piece or a particularly thoughtful wedding gift. But it\u2019s handsome enough that it does double duty as a storage vessel and decor\u2014plus it\u2019ll prevent food waste so you can claw back some pennies. You\u2019ll never have to throw out a forgotten liquifying peach again.Photo by Rocky Luten/Food52Emile Henry Ceramic Storage Bowl$140 at Food52Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyish Loves ItFruitShoppingHealthyishRecipes you want to make.
