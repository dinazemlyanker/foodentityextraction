When something\u2019s so easy to make that you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.Lately I have felt like a parking meter. \u201cFeed me!\u201d I blurt out every two hours to no one in particular, at which point I must have a small treat or I cannot, will not, and shall not go on. In the fugue state of the past five-and-a-half-but-who\u2019s-counting months, snacks\u2014salty or sweet, big or small, homemade or store-bought\u2014break up the sprawling hours and motivate me to get through my to-do list.I am not alone in this. A certain BA staffer who shall remain nameless told me that they keep a family-size bag of peanut M&Ms in the freezer for a reward every time they have filed a story. And my friends give their corgi-beagle mix Elsa a midafternoon \u201clunch\u201d (really, just a portion of her dinner) to quiet her down over the looong sprawl from noon to eight.My snack of choice is nori nut mix, which is a little spicy, a little sweet, and, thanks to the addition of crushed seaweed at the end, rich, savory, and a touch briny too. A fundamental ingredient in Japanese cuisine, nori is made by chopping or grinding seaweed (the word nori originally referred to all seaweed, but these days nori is mostly made from Porphyra yezoensis), mixing it with water to make a slurry and then, much like paper or rice paper wrappers, pressing and drying into sheets. In Japan, nori is, among countless other applications, used to wrap sushi, onigiri, and temaki; confetti\u2019d into furikake; shredded and sprinkled onto noodles, rice, and salads; crushed with gomasio; and cooked with soy and sugar for the inky condiment nori no tsukudani.\u00a0This seaweed isn\u2019t exclusive to Japan: It\u2019s known as zicai in China and gim in Korea, where the dried sheets are often seasoned with sesame oil and salt. In Wales, the same seaweed is boiled into a soft paste called laverbread that is sometimes coated in oatmeal and fried for laver cakes.\u00a0But for this nut mix, the dried seaweed is ground finely so that it can cling to every pecan ravine and walnut valley. Start by tossing 1\u00bd cups nuts (such as walnuts, cashews, almonds, or pecans), \u00bc cup sesame seeds, 2 Tbsp. honey, 1 Tbsp. olive oil, a big pinch of mild red pepper flakes (I like gochugaru, but you could also use Aleppo-style red pepper flakes or a much smaller pinch of cayenne or crushed red pepper flakes), and \u00be tsp. kosher salt in a large bowl.Slide the mixture onto a rimmed baking sheet or large cast-iron skillet and bake at 350\u00b0, shaking once or twice, until nuts are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, crush 2 toasted nori sheets in a spice mill, mortar and pestle, or by hand\u2014you want a fine powder, but some big pieces are okay! You can also use roasted seaweed snacks here. (I strongly recommend you buy extras to make Eric Kim\u2019s Nori Sour Cream Dip.)When the nuts are done, immediately toss with nori and let cool on the baking sheet. Store in an airtight container for up to a week and crack it open whenever you need it most\u2014for me, that\u2019s when I\u2019m putting off writing an email I don\u2019t want to send, when I\u2019ve just sent said email, and every hour on the hour.
