But for most in-the-field chefs with a flair for the dramatic, open-air setups are a far cry from their indoor counterparts in both form and function. The reason? Traditional materials like marble\u2014which stain easily, break often, and are famously temperamental\u2014simply can\u2019t last long outside, exposed to the elements. (And let\u2019s face it, even inside these materials often fall short.) Instead, outdoor cooks who are unafraid of getting dirty prefer luxe quartz surfaces from Caesarstone\u2019s new Outdoor Collection. Durable and sleek, these counters elevate whatever\u2019s on the menu, from casual charbroiled burgers to delicate filets of salmon.Need more convincing? These impressive dishes prove that these surfaces will help you live your best outdoor chef life.Grilled Beets with Citrus and HerbsCooking with richly hued ingredients can be an anxiety-inducing experience with standard counters. Why grill juicy beets over an open fire when a single ruby droplet might ruin your countertops forever? With Caesarstone\u2019s Outdoor Collection surfaces, cooks can breathe a welcome sigh of relief\u2014stains are a non-issue. Earthy beets get a hit of smoke from the grill, zinged up with charred orange and lemon. A flourish of fresh herbs\u2014fresh mint and chopped chives will do nicely\u2014finishes things off. After everything\u2019s cooked and plates are licked clean, just wipe down surfaces with a soft-scrub gel and non-abrasive sponge. Voila! Good as new. With the Outdoor Collection\u2019s non-porous counters, chefs can spend more time dreaming up new flavor combinations and less time worrying about how long it will take to clean up the resulting mess. Beets not your jam? Give caramelized pork chops marinated with turmeric and honey or saffron-spiked rack of lamb on the grill a whirl.Grilled Banana S\u2019moresThere\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t grill in the dead of winter. At least not if your outdoor kitchen is outfitted with Caesarstone\u2019s surfaces, which can easily weather elements from rain to shine to snow. Once temperatures dip, try grilling up ripe bananas and stuffing them inside an oozy graham cracker and marshmallow s\u2019mores sandwich. We recommend enjoying them under a blanket. This magic is possible thanks to a special formula developed by in-house experts, which ensures the quartz can withstand harsh UV rays and extreme conditions like long-term water exposure, ice, and temperatures ranging from -13\u00b0F to 122\u00b0F (-25\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C).Yogurt-Marinated Grilled ChickenOn a generously sized cutting board, pound chicken cutlets to a narrow \u00bd-inch thickness for this yogurt-marinated grilled chicken number, which is zinged up with plenty of garlic, lime juice, and a hearty dose of fragrant garam masala. Your counters can withstand harder impacts than materials including ceramic, granite, concrete, and stainless steel. Even better, they\u2019re scratch- and stain-resistant. Translation: You can cook more\u2014and cook harder\u2014so long as you exercise common sense.Cinnamon-Spiked Turkey ChiliNew shades in the Caesarstone Outdoor Collection mean there\u2019s a hue for every kind of cook. Love to simmer cinnamon-spiked turkey chili in gleaming copper pots in the fall? Go for clay-colored \u201cClearskies 406,\u201d which helps warm up spaces with earthen vibes. Are you famous for springtime cocktail parties where the Sazeracs don\u2019t stop flowing? Opt for \u201cPalm Shade 515,\u201d which boasts a translucent, marble-like white base and subtle veining. Meanwhile, creamy grey \u201cMidday 405\u201d is the right addition to your smartly manicured backyard enveloped in green foliage, a picture-perfect backdrop for an impromptu tea party complete with delicate radish-chive tea sandwiches and fruitcake petit fours.When you cook adventurously, you\u2019ll naturally want a kitchen that can keep up with you.
