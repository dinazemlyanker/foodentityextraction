Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a medium saucepan over medium. Cook garlic, stirring often, until golden brown, about 2 minutes.Step 2Add \u2153 cup soy sauce, 3 Tbsp. honey, 2 Tbsp. vinegar, 2 Tbsp. tahini, and 2 tsp. Sriracha and whisk until smooth.

Transfer remaining sauce to a medium bowl; set aside. Seal bag, pressing out air, and turn to coat pork. Let sit at least 20 minutes.Step 5Preheat a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium. Remove pork from bag with tongs, shaking off excess marinade. Cook pork chops until bottom side is golden brown, about 1 minute.Step 6Turn and cook on other side about 1 minute, then turn again. Continue to cook, turning about every minute, until chops are deep golden brown and charred in spots and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 135\u00b0, 15\u201318 minutes (cooking time will depend on thickness of chops). Transfer to a cutting board and let rest at least 10 minutes (pork will come to 145\u00b0 as it sits).Step 7Slice along bones to remove, then slice chops into \u00bd\"-thick pieces. Serve pork with reserved hoisin sauce spooned over.Step 8Do Ahead: Hoisin sauce can be made 4 days ahead; cover and chill. Thin with water if needed before using.

This was great.  I actually couldn\u2019t find tahnini, so I made my own (Googled it) - just food processed sesame seeds and add a little oil. This hoisin would be good with anything. AnonymousNew York5/6/2020The Hoisin sauce is sooooooo good! I used dark rice vinegar instead and it was still really good!
