He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.One weekday morning this past month, my wife announced that she was making French toast. I\u2019m not sure if I told her she was insane, but that\u2019s definitely what I was thinking. Who makes French toast at 7:03 a.m. when you\u2019re hustling to get your kid out the door to school?Hardly for the first time in our marriage, I was wrong\u2014and glad to have been.Pretty soon the kitchen smelled of melting butter, and then I heard that tssss...the sizzle of the custard-soaked bread hitting the hot (but not too hot!) cast-iron skillet.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!And before we knew it, our son Marlon was sitting down to a couple of griddled, golden-brown slices of country bread, and he was pouring maple syrup all over them and, being the dad that I am, I had to blurt out, \u201cMarlon, not so much syrup!\u201dInevitably, he always leaves a bit of unfinished French toast on his plate, and one of his parents, usually this one, steps in to finish it off. (I need some fuel before I head to the gym, right?)Obviously, you don\u2019t need me to tell you how good homemade French toast is. But sometimes a nudge to remind you how makable it is does comes in handy.How, if you have heavy cream or half-and-half on hand, go ahead and blend that in with the beaten eggs. How a splash of real vanilla extract is never a bad move. Or a dash of cinnamon, if that\u2019s your thing. And fry the toast in a mixture of butter and vegetable oil, which prevents the butter from burning.Oh, and most importantly, how the quick-and-easy custard needs a healthy pinch of salt (just like your favorite chocolate chip cookies do).So, yeah, go ahead and make French toast\u2014no matter what day of the week it is.Get the recipe:BA\u2019s Best French ToastA mixture of milk and cream delivers a custardy interior texture.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterFrench ToastBreakfastRead MorecookingThis Overnight French Toast Casserole Is a Holiday Breakfast as Exciting as PRESENTSSSSBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
