But while the main room is set to host an impressive lineup of DJs, the bright, airy cafe and bar attached is just as much of a destination. The beverage menu offers an array of housemade non-alcoholic tonics like blood orange celery soda and coconut water chamomile. And with food options like \u201cno bone\u201d mushroom broth and spelt with summer squash debuting this week, a night out at Public Records feels legitimately healthy.Public Records' blood orange celery soda\nPhoto by Emma FishmanFor many, going out and dancing have always been forms of stress release, ways to escape the anxieties of everyday life. But now more and more clubs are intentionally incorporating wellness practices\u2014like deep listening, adaptogenic cocktails, and plant-based cuisine\u2014to give partiers even more ways to find self-care after dark.At Nowadays, a sprawling nightclub complex in Ridgewood, Queens, you can lie on a woven blanket and listen to ambient music during their Thursday night Planetarium, dance until dawn on the same wood floor on Friday and Saturday, then bring your kid or your dog to the outdoor space on Sunday afternoon. The whole venue feels nearly spa-like, with salt lamps, kombucha on tap, and even, this past winter, a mobile outdoor sauna.Vibamins's lineup of rave-friendly smoothies\nPhoto by Laura MurrayHenry Rich, who owns several Brooklyn restaurants including Metta and Rucola, is a food and beverage partner at both Nowadays Public Records. For him, health and wellness are especially important in a club: \u201cYou're up until eight in the morning, so caffeine is great, but it\u2019s great if you can also have nutrients that will allow you to enjoy yourself all night and make you not feel terrible the next day,\u201d he said. \u201cJust living in New York, it's so important to refill the well that's constantly being drawn down.\u201dFor Nowadays co-founder Eamon Harkin, design elements like natural light were integral to the way he and his partner, Justin Carter, thought about the eclectic clubbing experiences they wanted to offer. \u201cWhen we went looking for a place to build Nowadays, we wanted a place that had outdoor space and indoor space, and we wanted the indoor space to have some natural light. Those characteristics afforded us the greatest flexibility to create different experiences,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are really craving an environment where they can switch off and just lower the noise levels in their lives.\u201dRemedi Food founder Marie Bedross\nPhoto by Emma FishmanThe beverage offerings at Nowadays include \u201cVibamins,\u201d non-alcoholic drinks with flavors like \u201cPre-rave\u201d (featuring raw cacao and maca root for energy) and \u201cPost-rave\u201d (with 5-HTP and milky oat straw for winding down). Vibamins are the brainchild of Marie Bedross, whose catering company, Remedi Food, supplies plant-based foods like tempeh BLTs to all-night raves and venues around the city. Bedross\u2019s goal is to introduce ravers to healthy eating when they need it most. \u201cThe only option [dancers] had was to dull themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cLet me make [them] sparkle a little bit.\u201dFor stud1nt, a DJ and producer who often performs at Nowadays\u2019 Thursday night Planetarium, giving up alcohol redefined their relationship to clubbing. Planetarium is appealing to them because unlike the drinking-heavy culture of so many club nights around New York, \u201cyou don't have to be in this super party mode.\u201d They compared it to the underground warehouse parties that used to be much more common in the city, where drinking was often much less of a focus.It took a cross-country move for journalist and event producer Michelle Lhooq to revisit her relationship to traditional party drugs. After moving from New York to L.A., \u201ca place where you want to be outside during the day,\u201d as she put it, she began to replace stimulants with weed. \u201cIt was amazing. I think my body felt like it was literally unwinding and unclenching,\u201d Lhooq said. Inspired by her newfound practices, she started Weed Rave, a cannabis-fueled party that held its first New York rave on (when else?) 4/20 in a secret warehouse space, following its maiden voyage in L.A. earlier this year. For Lhooq, raving has always been a communal activity; adding events like CBD yoga and a cannabis cooking class opens up the community to those who might not otherwise venture out to an all-night dance party.Public Records co-founders Francis Harris and Erik VanderWal\nPhoto by Emma FishmanFor others in the nightlife industry, wellness is more about inclusivity. Event producer Brian Sweeney founded Ambient Church to be \u201ca hybrid between a meditation class, a concert at a venue, and a techno party.\u201d A nomadic concert series held in cathedrals across the city, Ambient Church pairs electronic music with light shows mapped onto the churches\u2019 gothic details. The seated event often ends before 10 p.m., and its audience is just as likely to contain retirees as ravers. \u201cThere's people that like to go to meditation class, but they really don't like standing around in a venue. And then there's people who used to go to a lot of raves and nightlife, but they're trying to go to bed at a reasonable hour,\u201d Sweeney explains of his audiences. By its very nature, the music at Ambient Church, whether it\u2019s William Basinski\u2019s atmospheric compositions or Suzanne Ciani's methodical Buchla synthesizer loops, encourages mindfulness. \u201cIt's about listening carefully and not waiting for the song to end or progress,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cIt's about being in the moment as it happens.\u201dTo Public Records co-founder Francis Harris, a DJ and producer who has incorporated meditation into his daily life, sustainable partying is the only way forward: \u201cAs you get older, the only pathway to happiness, I think, is to let go of the short term gains for long-term wellness.\u201dThe Nowaday's dance floor is a phone-free zone.\nPhoto by Laura MurrayExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishNew York CityPartyTrendsRecipes you want to make.
