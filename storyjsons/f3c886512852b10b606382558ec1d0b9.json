But there is no substitute for homemade b\u00e9chamel\u2014of this we can be sure.Ingredients 8 servings B\u00e9chamel6Tbsp. unsalted butter3Tbsp. all-purpose flour3cups whole milk1oz. Parmesan, grated (about \u00bd cup)Pinch of cayenne pepperPinch of ground nutmegKosher saltAssembly2bunches green Swiss chard3Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil1lb. sweet Italian sausage, casings removed1lb. whole-milk fresh ricottaKosher salt1lb. fresh pasta sheets (about 16 6x4\" pieces) or 12 oz. dried jumbo shells (about 30)2cups store-bought marinara sauce (such as Rao\u2019s)Grated Parmesan (for sprinkling)PreparationB\u00e9chamelStep 1Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook, whisking occasionally, until mixture smells slightly nutty, about 3 minutes. Whisk in milk, then increase heat to medium-high. Whisking constantly, bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook just until thick and no longer floury tasting, 8\u201310 minutes. Add Parmesan and whisk until melted, then whisk in cayenne and nutmeg; season with salt. Cover b\u00e9chamel and keep warm until ready to use.Step 2Do Ahead: B\u00e9chamel can be made 3 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill. Reheat over medium-low, whisking constantly and adding a splash of water\nif needed to loosen.AssemblyStep 3Remove ribs and stems from Swiss chard leaves and thinly slice. Tear leaves into large pieces. Combine oil and sausage with Swiss chard ribs and stems in a large skillet and set over medium-high heat. Cook, breaking up sausage with a heatproof rubber spatula or wooden spoon into small pieces, until sausage is almost cooked through, 5\u20137 minutes.Step 4Add Swiss chard leaves to skillet a handful at a time, tossing and letting them wilt slightly between additions, until all the leaves have been added. Cook, reducing heat as needed (liquid should be bubbling slightly at this point), until liquid is almost completely evaporated (it\u2019s important to dry out the Swiss chard here so the filling isn\u2019t soggy), about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Let cool 5 minutes, then stir in ricotta. Season filling with salt.Step 5If using pasta sheets, cook in a pot of boiling salted water 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl of cold water and let cool, about 30 seconds. Lay out a row of pasta sheets on a rimmed baking sheet (don\u2019t overlap), then top with a sheet of waxed or parchment paper. Repeat with remaining pasta sheets, placing sheets of paper between each layer.Step 6If using shells, cook in a pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, just until very al dente, about 3 minutes less than package instructions; rinse under cold water to cool quickly.Step 7Preheat oven to 375\u00b0. Spread half of b\u00e9chamel into a 13x9\" baking dish. If using pasta sheets, lay out a sheet on a clean surface with a short end facing you. Spoon a heaping \u00bc-cupful of filling so it runs all the way down the center. Roll pasta around filling to create a 1\u00bc\"-diameter tube (the pasta will overlap quite a bit). Repeat with remaining pasta sheets, arranging in baking dish as you go to create 2 rows. If using shells, spoon a heaping tablespoonful of filling into each shell and nestle next to each other to create rows (you\u2019ll have about 5 rows of 6 shells each). Spread remaining b\u00e9chamel over cannelloni, then marinara sauce. Top with Parmesan.Step 8Bake cannelloni until edges of pasta are lightly browned and sauce is bubbling around edges of pan, 30\u201340 minutes.Step 9Do Ahead: Filling can be made 2 days ahead. Let cool completely, then cover and chill.How would you rate Sausage and Ricotta Baked Cannelloni?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (6)Back to TopTriangleWHY would you make B\u00c9CHAMEL and then say to use \"store-bought marinara sauce\"... WHY!! Fail, just FAILJust The CookTn6/4/2021Turned out great!  I made no changes to the recipe.  Next time I will probably season a little more (salt & pepper) but I loved the way the Swiss Chard was shining through without being overbearing.  From start to putting it in the oven took me 55 minutes - I used the shells which make a fun presentation.AnonymousAlaska10/14/2019Fantastic!  \nUsed hot Italian sausage. Used half the chard. \nUsed manicotti shells ( 8 ). and this was about right  proportionally. \nAbout 1/3 cup of fillings was leftover and so added to marinara sauce   \nAlso broiled on high for crisping the top for a minute or so.  \nNeeds to rest about 10 minutes or so. \nThe bechamel makes all the difference. Put the effort into this step!\nI used leftover sauce from another recipe and it was fine. Any basic red sauce would work. AnonymousSeattle 9/10/2019LOVE this recipe. I was worried it would be too much chard but it definitely was not. Might add even more next time.darknightMemphis7/22/2019So good! I have made it multiple times. I have also started making a variation where I forgo stuffing shells for layering everything with lasagna pasta, which saves a bit of time.AnonymousSomerville, MA7/6/2019This recipe was delicious! When I was making the b\u00e9chamel I thought it was going to be such a heavy, rich dish that no one would be able to eat it. However, with everything baked and the meat/chard juices evaporated, it ended up being weirdly light and lovely. Part of it is such a good ratio of chard to ricotta in the filling- it balances out really well. I also liked just using a bit of parm on the top instead of mozzarella. The only ways I deviated from the recipe were straining out some sausage/chard liquid because there was too much to wait for it to evaporate and using manicotti noodles instead of shells. Otherwise, followed the directions to the T and it was so good. It fed 5 people with 2 leftover servings. mhdsileskyAustin, TX4/22/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titPastaCasseroleItalian AmericanAmericanSausageMeatRicottaCheeseSwiss ChardLeafy GreensVegetablePasta ShellsPasta & NoodlesMainNut-FreeDinnerRecipes you want to make.
