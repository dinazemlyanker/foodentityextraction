It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Who you calling dowdy\u201cAn unattractive woman.\u201d \u201c(Almost always of a woman or her dress.) Shabbily dull in colour or appearance; without brightness, smartness, or freshness.\u201d Well gee whiz. I was just trying to make Basically\u2019s tried-and-true apple pandowdy last weekend, when I fell down an Oxford English Dictionary rabbit hole tracing the origins of \u201cpandowdy\u201d (and therefore the unfortunate \u201cdowdy\u201d). It\u2019s baked, spiced apples and brown butter downstairs, and flaky shingles of haphazard puff pastry upstairs. (It\u2019s our easiest apple dessert, hands-down-y.) According to the OED, pandowdy shows up in cookbooks around 1846, in Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s writing, and in the work of John Updike at least twice, which seems to make sense. That led me down the rabbit hole of a catchy Pennsylvania Dutch tune that goes: \u201cShoo-fly pie and apple pandowdy, makes your eyes light up, your tummy say \u2018howdy!\u2019\u201d Which has been stuck in my head for days now.Bake it: Apple Pandowdy (Pro-tip: Egg-wash the top for an even shinier, shattering finish.)Courtesy of AldiWhat\u2019s the deal withAll these food advent calendars? They used to be cheap cardboard trays with nativity Bible verses and mediocre chocolates that ease you into the season of sugar. Now Aldi sells cheese, wine, and beer advent calendars. Bonne Maman makes a (sold out!) calendar with teeny-tiny jams. There\u2019s a marshmallow one. A ...hard seltzer... one. A Trader Joe\u2019s cat treat one. Haribo! The Elmer Gantry in me feels like we\u2019ve strayed from the light here. Like maybe you\u2019re just buying lots of stuff in a scenario when you would have been buying none of that stuff. Ya know? Think about it. That\u2019s too much jam.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Photo by Priya KrishnaHis name is Seth and he bakes, it\u2019s \u201cSeth Bakes\u201d!\u201cSeth Bakes\u201d is the Instagram Story reality show that follows a man named Seth baking elaborate goods live! \u00e0 la minute! It\u2019s hosted and narrated and broadcast by his significant other, BA contributing writer Priya Krishna. See his recent cardamom-cinnamon buns above. All we know about Seth is that he\u2019s a meticulous, self-critical architect who favors a Book of Mormon apron, so I sought out to learn a little more.What\u2019s going on here?I don\u2019t know, honestly. Priya started filming me one day. I was trying to fulfill my New Year\u2019s resolution to learn a new baking technique every week. I was minding my own business, and suddenly my life winds up on the internet.What\u2019s the earliest you\u2019ve woken up to bake something?5 a.m., to make rhubarb danishes!What\u2019s the biggest baking challenge you\u2019ve encountered?Sfogliatelle!!!! [Italian pastries that look like accordion files.] That was a disaster. It was doomed from the start. But I would chalk my baking attempts to one all-encompassing fail. [Editor\u2019s note: We absolutely would NOT.]What happened when your coworkers realized you\u2019re \u201cSeth, from Seth Bakes\u201d?On the way to a work event with my coworkers, I got called out on the street, and then once we got to the event, another coworker asked me about it in front of everyone. It was very embarrassing.What\u2019s harder, building a building or building a croquembouche?A building....of course. It is so hard. It is IMPOSSIBLY hard. Buildings take, like, 10 years sometimes.Cool cool cool.Alex LauWhat the kaleI enjoyed reading about the rise and fall of kale in The Atlantic this week, but I gotta say, I still love the foresty Tuscan stuff. Especially when you get it super crispy, like in this new recipe by Heidi Swanson. Carla Lalli Music\u2019s whole-lotta-kale spaghetti recipe is another go-to. And how could we EVER forget Chris Morocco\u2019s controversial but delicious kale reuben, so crazy it works?!Find all kinds of kale recipes here.Congrats to Sang!If you read about Sandwich Hag in Dallas, a game-changing restaurant for people with different abilities, you\u2019ll be as elated as we are to learn that chef Reyna Duong\u2019s brother Sang is now food handler certified. If you didn\u2019t read it, well, read it! Then you\u2019ll know why this is such a big deal.Read it: Sandwich Hag Is Teaching Dallas How to Hire DifferentlyPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Pearl JonesNo kale here thoMy love for the Lasagna cookbook is so strong it\u2019s our #BAcookbookclub pick for October. Get a copy and cook along with us! (That means tag @bonappetitmag when you do and we\u2019ll regram ya.)  And we have the recipe for the cheesy, breakfast-appropriate carbonara lasagna that I made and ate for a solid week, happily ever after.Get the recipe: Carbonara LasagnaUnnecessary food feud of the weekGoat cheese. It rarely shows up in Bon App\u00e9tit recipes, and yet, we all seem to love it. Christina Chaey shared a gruesome photo of a soggy salad with a patty of fried goat cheese in the center saying, \u201cAnyone who says they don\u2019t want that is lying.\u201d But no one came out from hiding. \u201cA crusted goat cheese patty in a salad is a nice thing,\u201d Emma Wartzman concurred. \u201cCover it in breadcrumbs and fry it\u201d is the only way Andy Baraghani wants to eat it. \u201cI could write 500 words on goat cheese! It\u2019s my favorite animal cheese,\u201d Carey Polis called out to me from inside her office. Okay, Carey, you get 29 more: \u201cIt\u2019s the tangiest cheese, and the most lactic. What is better than sitting on the couch with a wedge of Humboldt Fog and some Carr's Crackers?! NOTHING IS BETTER.\u201d Carla \u201clikes it,\u201d she said. \u201cFresh and aged.\u201d Revealing! Molly Baz \u201cwouldn\u2019t touch it with a ten foot pole.\u201d Highly particular Chris Morocco \u201cwill always have room in my heart for a bit of Monterrey Ch\u00e8vre and Vermont Creamery Binns Bouche, but that is IT.\u201d \u201cDoes halloumi count?\u201d Asked Christa Guerra. Well, sometimes. \u201cCUZ IT\u2019S INCREDIBLE.\u201dSarah Jampel had the last word (and image):Get the recipe pictured further up: Marinated Goat Cheese with Herbs and SpicesExplore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecookingThis One Rule Separates Good Baking Apples From The LosersBy Sarah JampelcookingThe Easy Thanksgiving Dessert For \"People Who Don't Bake\"By Amiel Stanekeffed it up3 Reasons Why Your Baking Fail Is Probably Not Your FaultBy Claire SaffitzcookingThis Buttery German Apple Cake Cured Me of My Apple FatigueBy Emma WartzmanRecipes you want to make.
