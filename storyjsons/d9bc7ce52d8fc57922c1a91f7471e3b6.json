See our past recommendations here!Every night, before I go to sleep, I slip on this eye massager my in-laws gave me. It makes me look like Robocop and sometimes leaves marks around my eyes, but I don't care. Because once I press the little button on the side to turn it on and the gears inside start to warm up, I'm transported to another blissed-out dimension.It starts with what feels like big marbles rolling across my face, like those Baoding balls you rotate in your palms to relax. They slowly contract and tighten, applying slightly more pressure and warmth with each pulse as they move down my temples towards my eyes. Right about when it feels like the eye massager has turned on me, taking on a life of its own with malicious plans to squeeze my brains out and conquer the world, it releases, expelling air like a deep yoga breath. Eventually, I got used to it. Now, I crave it.The massager has five modes, each featuring a different combination of air pressure, vibration, and/or hot compression. And there are no actual marbles/Baoding balls, from what I can tell! I imagine it\u2019s the pressure and the actual gears of the massager that create the rolling sensation. Four of the modes come with vaguely medieval-y music that reminds me of being on hold with my insurance company, so I always opt for sleep mode, a.k.a. no music. Technically, this mode is just air pressure, but somehow I still feel that same warming sensation, stress-relieving pulsing, and marble-rolling-esque tranquility.As the massager kneads my face like it\u2019s dough, I can feel my jaw slacken and whatever stress I\u2019m holding onto fade. By the time the massage is over, my husband has to remove the massager since I'm already deep into my REM cycle. It doesn\u2019t get more relaxing than that.Buy It: Homiee Eye Massager, $49All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
