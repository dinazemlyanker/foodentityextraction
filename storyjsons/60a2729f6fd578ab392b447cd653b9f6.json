Luckily, senior food editor Andy Baraghani is here to hold our hands and show us the light with this fast, foolproof grilled salmon recipe. Using skin-on fillets creates a wonderfully crunchy skin, plus the skin acts as a barrier to protect the flesh of the salmon from overcooking. Bonus: There\u2019s no need to flip. Paired with a fiercely bright lemon-sesame sauce that uses, yes, the whole lemon\u2014peel, pith, and all\u2014this recipe is a new inductee into the Healthyish weeknight grilling hall of fame.Salmon cooks fast, so start by getting everything ready to go. Prepare a grill for medium heat, and rub the salmon with olive oil before seasoning both sides with kosher salt. The secret to creating a nonstick surface on the grill is ensuring it\u2019s really hot and clean, so let the grill preheat for 15-30 minutes at least.The whole lemon-sesame sauce, in all its glory.\nPhoto by Alex LauWhile the grill is preheating, make that sauce. Start by cutting the ends off a small lemon to stand it upright like an apple, then slice off each of the sides (including peel, pith, and flesh) in four sections so you're left with a square-shaped core. Don't throw it away! (You can toss the seeds). Finely chop the sections\u2014and we do mean \"finely,\" otherwise you'll be biting down on chunks of lemon peel. Transfer the chopped lemon to a small bowl and squeeze the juice from the core over it all before adding honey, sesame oil, sesame seeds, olive oil, and a finely chopped shallot. \u201cThis makes a bright, bitter sauce because you\u2019re eating the pith, but the honey counteracts the bitterness,\u201d says Baraghani. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of an amazing sauce.\u201d Real modest, Andy. But, uh, we totally agree.When the sauce is done and that grill is good and hot, give the grates a good scrub with a grill brush to ensure the fish won\u2019t stick to anything. (Grills are easier to cook when clean!) Slick the grates with oil immediately before placing the salmon on the grill, then quickly cover the salmon for 6 to 8 minutes while it cooks. Keeping the fish covered guarantees a shatteringly crisp, chicharron-like skin that releases from the grates easily, and the flesh can gently cook through at the same rate. If the fish doesn\u2019t release easily from the grates, let it go for another 30 seconds.Transfer the salmon to a plate and let cool slightly, then top with a torn herb like chives, parsley, or basil, and spoon the lemon-sesame sauce on top. We love grilled salmon because it\u2019s rich and versatile, but this recipe works great with any skin-on fish. Try black bass, striped bass, or snapper, and let this foolproof technique lead the way. (Just increase the grilling time for thicker pieces of fish and decrease grilling time for thinner ones.)  With a recipe this quick and surprising, you'll want to do dinner on the grill all summer long, which is a very good habit to have.Get the recipe:Grilled Crispy-Skinned Salmon with Whole Lemon-Sesame SauceFor this lemony grilled salmon recipe, the key is cooking fish that still has its skin on.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishGrillSalmonRead MoreLifestyleThe Best Way to Buy Sustainable Seafood?
