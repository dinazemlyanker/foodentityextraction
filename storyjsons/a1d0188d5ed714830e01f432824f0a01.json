Any nutritional substance that\u2019s shaped into a rectangle then packaged and shipped to a convenience store where it sits on a shelf for a questionable amount of time? Sign me up.Honey Stinger Cracker N\u2019 Nut Butter Snack Bars are the ones that have taken residency in my backpack as of late. I have tasted all the bars on all the shelves\u2014including ones for body builders (Quest bars) and kids (Clif Zbars)\u2014but I didn\u2019t meet Honey Stingers while strolling through Duane Reade. They were brought to my attention at a marathon expo a few months ago; next to all the energy gels and powders at the fueling table, they looked extra-appealing. I ate one immediately in the name of carbo-loading (one bar has 23 grams of carbs) and intended to save the other for after the race. Instead I ate it a couple hours later\u2014let\u2019s just say to ease pre-race nerves.Photo by Chelsie CraigCompared to all the other bars out there, Honey Stingers have a lot going for them. They\u2019re crunchy, so biting into one doesn\u2019t feel like eating a pile of hardened glue. They aren\u2019t artificially flavored (the chocolate actually tastes like chocolate). And, they aren\u2019t trying to hide behind the picture of health (they are not protein bars). They are simply a chocolate-covered, nut butter-filled salty cracker sandwich that you can eat whether you\u2019re carbo-loading for a marathon or feeling snacky after lunch. Did I mention they taste amazing? Specifically, like the love child of saltines and a Reese\u2019s cup.Though the brand\u2019s website markets its products to active, outdoorsy people like mountain climbers and trail runners, you can be a chronic sitter and still enjoy these snack bars. I\u2019ve tried all three varieties while sitting at my desk\u2014almond butter and dark chocolate, cashew butter and milk chocolate, and peanut butter and milk chocolate\u2014but my favorite is the almond and dark chocolate one. It\u2019s got a perfect salty, sweet, nutty balance that satisfies a 3 p.m. craving\u2014not something every snack in the office, or fanny pack, can do.Buy it: Honey Stinger Cracker N\u2019 Nut Butter Snack Bars, $22 for a 12-pack on AmazonAnd now, for the greatest peanut butter of all time:This Is the Best Peanut Butter of All TimePut down the fancy expensive peanut butter and get with our supermarket pick.View StoryAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.
