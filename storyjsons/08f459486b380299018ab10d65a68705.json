Ordering is not an option here, so toss any notions of control aside. At Mesa B, every dish and wine is a surprise right up to the moment it\u2019s presented to you\u2014the \u201cmenu\u201d for the night is nothing but a photocopied sheet of chicken scratch chef\u2019s notes (example menu item: \u201ccarne\u201d). As T\u00e9llez stands in the wide open kitchen behind you, flipping a sizzling skillet with a crazed, mad-scientist look in his eyes, all you can really expect is the unexpected. Well, that and a glass or two of the funky stuff from T\u00e9llez\u2019s own highly acclaimed natural wine label, Bichi.THE VIBE IS: intimate, candlelit, underground supper club. Dinners are housed in a small concrete room attached to the wine storage facility for T\u00e9llez\u2019s restaurant Amaya, decorated with a large pastel painting, some wood furniture, and a few potted palms. Being there feels like you\u2019re in on a secret, or initiated into the coolest of cool kid clubs.PRACTICAL STUFF: The dinners occur monthly; email mesabmex@gmail.com to reserve your spot at the next one.\u2014Hilary CadiganWE ALSO LOVEAmayaStar chef Ja\u00edr Tell\u00e9z\u2019s most recent opening, boasting the country\u2019s first all-natural wine listContramarGrilled fish, palomas, and good vibes for any occasionCicatrizBig salads (and a killer fried chicken sandwich) in a city where such things aren\u2019t easy to findExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
