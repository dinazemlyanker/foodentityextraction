(OPTIONAL: to really jazz up your margarita, add half of ripe passion fruit into the shaker, you won\u2019t be disappointed!) Lock in your shaker and shake for 45 seconds until outside of your shaker gets icy.Step 3Before straining over your glass, be sure to grab the remaining \u00bd of meyer lemon and fold it over the lip of your glass and around to salt the rim (have the salt on a small plate to spin the lip of the glass onto). Once the rim is salted, fill the glass up \u00bd way with ice then pour the strained drink over it. Garnish with a meyer lemon pinwheel.How would you rate Meyer Lemon Margarita?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (1)Back to TopTriangleDon't you mean cane sugar?
