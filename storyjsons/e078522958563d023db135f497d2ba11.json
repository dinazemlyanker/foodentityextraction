I am sorry for veering off course. But I am not sorry for the end result!In my defense, this dish really does have a couple of things in common with actual shakshuka: Like, a) There are eggs gently cooked in a spicy sauce. And b) You can make it for brunch or dinner or that 4 p.m. on a Sunday\u2026snack? (Mealtimes are a construct.) And c) You\u2019ll probably end up eating half of it yourself, even if you think there are going to be leftovers the next day.But it strays from the traditional Middle Eastern dish in its very foundation: Instead of tomatoes and peppers, you\u2019ve got spinach and kale cooked in a Southeast Asian-style green coconut curry that\u2019s full of the sort of herby-spicy-acidity I crave all summer long.You start by blanching two pounds of greens. Yes, you have to do this: Flash-cooking them in hot, salty water, then quickly wringing them dry seasons them, softens them, and means that they won\u2019t leak their unwanted moisture into your sauce.You\u2019ll be tempted, if you\u2019re like me, to stop cooking and start eating at two different points in this recipe. First, once you\u2019ve blended the sauce\u2014a creamy and crazy-fragrant mixture of coconut milk, toasted coriander seeds, lemongrass, curry leaves, ginger, chile, and garlic. And, second, after you\u2019ve poured it over the greens and allowed the two to join forces. Here is a delicious and complete thing\u2014you could eat it as is, like creamed greens, or add pan-fried tofu or cooked chickpeas or seared shrimp or blanched snap peas.But persevere: It\u2019s worth it to get to the eggs! I like to leave them runny so that their yolks will mingle with and enrich the sauce, but cook them a little longer if you\u2019re a hard-boiled kind of eater. Instead of sopping up my plate with bread or pita, I like to serve this shakshuka-y situation over rice so that the sauce can trickle down into all of the grains.If you want true shakshuka, you can make this one with chickpeas and feta, or this one with butternut squash and sambal, or this 30-minute shorty with fried garlic and shallots, or this one with cherry tomatoes, basil, and chile flakes.But if you want something that\u2019s slightly different and surprisingly delicious\u2026green curry shakshuka is here for you.Let's crack some eggs:Coconut Curry Greens with Runny EggsThis shakshuka-inspired dish is green because it forgoes the traditional tomatoes and red peppers for spinach and kale.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishEggBrunchKaleRead MorecookingWeekend Plans: This Quiche With a Magic Sweet Potato CrustBy Chris MoroccoRecipes you want to make.
