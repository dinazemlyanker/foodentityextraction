Try fennel, small turnips, or Asian pear, shaved or cut into matchsticks. Black lentils, sometimes called beluga or caviar lentils, are great in salads because they keep their shape well once they\u2019re cooked. Check on them often while they boil as they can overcook quickly.Ingredients4 Servings1\u00bdcups black beluga lentils, rinsedKosher salt2lemons1shallot, thinly sliced1garlic clove, finely grated\u00bccup coarsely chopped parsley2Tbsp. sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar1Tbsp. pure maple syrup\u00bdtsp. crushed red pepper flakes3Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling2red beets, peeled, sliced into matchsticks2medium carrots, peeled, sliced into matchsticks (optional)1green apple, sliced into matchsticks\u00bdcup very thinly sliced red cabbagePlain whole-milk Greek yogurt (for serving)PreparationStep 1Cook lentils in a large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm, 20\u201325 minutes.

Used canned black lentils, worked well and cut prep time down significantlyAnonymousOakland, CA12/9/2020It was a dish I didn\u2019t know I needed. Great flavor and yes checking the lentils is a must. I understand now. It\u2019s a hearty  dish with flavor infusions all over. I can see this being summery too. Emikoftokyo NYC12/8/2020Nice, fresh, easy recipe for early winter. Omitted the garlic and shallot due to allergies in the house, and it was still very delicious. Also added an egg for some extra protein and calories. Ate leftovers a day later, and the salad was still crisp and fresh.AnonymousDenver, CO12/6/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSlawSaladBeetVegetableBlack LentilLentilRed CabbageCabbageLeafy GreensCarrotEasyQuickSideNut-FreeGluten-FreeVegetarianHealthyishLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
