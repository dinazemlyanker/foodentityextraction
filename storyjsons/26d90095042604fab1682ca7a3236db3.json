She was rushed into emergency surgery and spent the next few days in the ICU with a mystery illness. When she awoke from anesthesia, she was having trouble breathing and believed she would die. In her hospital bed she was surprised to discover that she was not asking herself whether she had accomplished enough in her life, but whether she \u201clived in kindness\u201d to herself and others. Eventually her illness was diagnosed as either an \u201cunknown viral infection\u201d or Lyme disease, she says, \u201cdepending on the doctor.\u201d Over the next 18 months of recovery, with both her physical and cognitive abilities impaired, Salbi spent several hours every day meditating, \u201cbecause I couldn\u2019t think, I couldn\u2019t write,\u201d she says. This period of intensive reflection brought forth an existential crisis. \u201cIf I can\u2019t [be] the activist or the writer or the journalist or whatever, then who am I?\u201d she wondered.In 1993, at the age of 23, Salbi had founded the nonprofit Women for Women International, where she spent almost two decades fighting for women\u2019s rights and setting up food sufficiency centers in war zones, \u201cmanaging what grew to 700 staff members,\u201d and raising awareness about the plight of women in war. After stepping down as the organization\u2019s CEO in 2011 due to burnout, she produced documentary shows, including #MeToo, Now What? on PBS, The Zainab Salbi Project on HuffPost, and Through Her Eyes at Yahoo News. \u201cI would crash every three or four months because I would work myself to death,\u201d she says. Each time she would recover at a wellness retreat, like the Omega Institute. Once she bounced back, she\u2019d dive headfirst into her work again. \u201cI wasn\u2019t anchored in myself. I would just charge,\u201d she says, raising a clenched fist like Joan of Arc, \u201cbut then would be left depleted.\u201dBut a year ago, and 12 months into her recovery, she moved to a cabin in Dutchess County, New York, adopted a cat, started tending to a vegetable garden, and switched to a plant-based diet. \u201cTo be very honest, I thought I had retired [from humanitarian work],\u201d she says. But after springing into action last month to help evacuate Afghan women leaders whose lives were threatened, she believes her profound lifestyle change has allowed her to become more effective as an activist.Almost everything has changed in her new life. \u201cI am vigilant about meditation and yoga. I don\u2019t call it meditation; I call it an \u2018appointment with my heart,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cWith yoga, I call it an appointment with my body. It\u2019s so easy to skip them, but if I call them appointments, I have to [show up].\u201dWhile experiencing chronic pain during her recovery, an alternative doctor instructed Salbi to switch to a plant-based diet. Within a week, she says, her pain disappeared and she became \u201cso grateful to earth.\u201d During the summer months Salbi grows lettuce, peppers, and a variety of herbs in her upstate garden. The weekend before we spoke via Zoom, her family visited from Washington, D.C., and she made plant-based versions of her favorite Middle Eastern recipes. \u201cI use a lot of old recipes from my mom, but I take the meat away,\u201d she says. One dish, a stew called sabzi, requires lots of greens, like spinach, parsley, and cilantro. \u201cAny greens, you chop, chop, chop, chop, chop,\u201d she says, pantomiming the motion. She then adds onions, tomatoes, and \u201can old, dried lemon\u201d to vegetable broth, which becomes an \u201cabsolutely delicious\u201d green stew.Of all the flavors she grew up with, Salbi\u2019s most obsessed with za\u2019atar, using it in salads or to make homemade pita chips. \u201cI mix za\u2019atar with olive oil to make it into a paste,\u201d she says, before spreading it atop pita and baking until crisp. \u201cI go to Paterson, New Jersey, where there\u2019s a [Middle Eastern neighborhood], and I buy there,\u201d she says. \u201cBut every time anybody comes from the Middle East, I beg them for za\u2019atar. My brother was just visiting and he brought me a whole bag of fresh za\u2019atar that was just so profoundly delicious.\u201dOn September 29, Salbi launched a podcast called Redefined in partnership with a start-up called FindCenter, where she is now the Chief Awareness Officer. The podcast focuses on thinking about alternative definitions of success, much like Salbi did while she was in the hospital. Early guests included CNN anchor Don Lemon, musician Annie Lennox, and Zen priest Rev. angel Kyodo williams. \u201cIt\u2019s much more about how to deal with these moments of the unknown,\u201d Salbi says. \u201cHow to deal with your anxiety or your anger, all the issues that we all go through but rarely talk about in public.\u201d Aside from producing Salbi\u2019s podcast, FindCenter\u2014\u201ca digital platform for self-discovery and personal development,\u201d she explains\u2014hosts one of the world\u2019s largest curated catalog of spirituality content, covering books, articles, podcasts, and videos.When her focus shifted to wellness and \u201cthis Zen lifestyle,\u201d Salbi believed her activist days were over. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my god, I lost it.\u2019 Like, I no longer have the activist in me, you know?\u201d Then, on August 13\u2014a week after five provincial capitals in Afghanistan fell to the Taliban, which was closing in on the capital city of Kabul\u2014she got a call from a friend in the human rights community who said, \u201cThere\u2019s a list of women who are high-profile leaders in Afghanistan whose lives are at risk and there\u2019s no evacuation plans for them.\u201d Instincts from her former life kicked in reflexively. She called everyone she knew who might be able to make a difference. Some contacts gave money, while some personally \u201ctook on the task of the evacuation,\u201d and others spread the word and made important introductions to even more people who could help. \u201cI was like, \u2018My sisters are in danger!\u2019\u201d she says of the women, many of whom she knew and had worked with previously through Women for Women International.\u201c[It seemed like] there was no U.S. government plan to truly evacuate [Afghan citizens], or to prioritize the evacuation of women,\u201d she says, tearing up. Salbi contributed to an unofficial coalition of women leaders and women\u2019s organizations that became \u201ca most beautiful and sad movement of sisterhood,\u201d she says. Together, the coalition raised funds and arranged for 500 evacuations and resettlements, and the work is still ongoing, Salbi says. Though she participated as an individual, the coalition is now led by \u201cvarious groups, including Vital Voices,\u201d the nonprofit founded by Hillary Clinton, Madeleine Albright, and Melanne Verveer.\u201cIt became a 24/7 operation where, literally, I slept with my phone next to my head and got calls hourly,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is still going on. I mean it\u2019s not talked about [anymore]. I don\u2019t know if the media is even talking about it.\u201d There are still thousands of people who are in Afghanistan, terrified for their lives, she says. \u201cI feel we cannot forget them and we shouldn\u2019t forget them. We have to keep the torch going. But for me, what I realized in the process is that, Wow, yes, the cause does not require [complete] self-sacrifice [to still be effective].\u201dDuring the past several weeks of advocating for Afghan refugees, she has found that taking a few hours for herself every day has given her more energy. \u201cWhat helps me stay anchored is not feeling guilty about sleeping, allowing myself to sleep, allowing myself the meditation, allowing myself the healthy food,\u201d she says. As a result, \u201cthe last few weeks have not depleted me.\u201d In other words, she\u2019s not expecting to crash and retreat. Now, she says, \u201cI know what it would take to go through this marathon and get the job done. But I also know how not to get lost in the process.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titCultureRead Moreculture\u2018Kid of the Internet\u2019 Quinta Brunson Wants Us to Keep Growing (and Growing and Growing)By Leigh-Ann JacksoncultureFor Ceramist Stephanie Shih, There\u2019s No Such Thing as Art Without ActivismBy Leah BhabhacultureHow Paralympian Kaleo Kanahele Maclay Gets Through Training, Motherhood, and Running a Coffee ShopBy Ali FrancisRecipes you want to make.
