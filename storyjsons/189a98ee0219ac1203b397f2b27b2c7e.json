Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.It\u2019s felt pretty quiet in the Bon App\u00e9tit office this week...we\u2019re definitely all still recovering. My Best Weekend Ever actually started on Wednesday with an extended friend hang, slid into Thursday with a party for Alison Roman\u2019s just-launched cookbook, rolled up into Friday with smashburgers in the Test Kitchen, stumbled into Saturday with the Hot 10 extravaganza and a night on the dance floor, and petered out on Sunday when I failed to make it to Rick Martinez\u2019s tacos and beer thing. Sorry, Rick! I heard it was delicious.To balance out all the partying, I\u2019ve been eating tofu. Specifically these Spicy Tofu Crumbles that Claire Saffitz developed nearly four years ago (and that everyone\u2019s favorite vegetarian Sarah Jampel reminded me about earlier this year) but I never paid attention to until now. I\u2019m just one of those \u201cnot-that-into-tofu\u201d people, okay? Well, I regret the last four years of my life, because these tofu crumbles come together in ten minutes and taste, I swear, like Mexican chorizo. I\u2019d eat them in tortillas or over brown rice with pickly things and maybe a soft-boiled egg.Squash: It's what's for dinner.\nPhoto by Emma Fishman, Food Styling by Kat BoystovaI also think you should make this brand-new squash recipe for dinner. It's Sohla El-Waylly's follow up to those zucchini fritters you all freaked about, and it features maybe the most powerful Power Sauce ever to come out of the Test Kitchen during my time: Greek yogurt, olive oil, crushed olives, olive juice, dill, and the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, charred red onions. This sauce is the Logan Roy of sauces. Or is it more of a Kendall? Make it, and let me know what you think: healthyish@condenast.com.Hey, look! It's an event! On November 5th, Healthyish is hosting a breakfast in NYC for women who love to travel. We\u2019re joining up with Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler\u2019s Women Who Travel along with our faves, Future of Women, at Haenyeo, Jenny Kwak\u2019s homestyle Korean restaurant in Brooklyn. Lale Arikoglu, CNT\u2019s senior lifestyle editor and co-host of the Women Who Travel podcast, is going to chat with Shelma Jun of Flash Foxy and Sarah Knapp of OutdoorFest about how to make outdoor travel more accessible to all. Jenny will serve up a true Korean breakfast: homemade dumplings, steamed egg casserole, squash pancakes, cabbage miso soup, and more. This is a small event, so get your tickets now, and I'll see you there.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish EditorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletteressayRead MoreLifestyleWould You Go Running in Jeans?By Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
