I love them because they actually keep me full when I eat one between meals. I love them because they are as soft and chewy as cookie dough right out of the fridge. I love them because they taste kind of like cookie dough too, especially the peanut butter chocolate chip, which is my favorite of the four flavors (there\u2019s also plain peanut butter, almond butter, and coconut cashew). I love that the first three ingredients in said bar are, inexplicably, \u201dpeanuts, peanut butter (peanuts), peanut.\u201cEver since I polished off those first samples, I\u2019ve wanted a stash of these bars in my home fridge and work fridge at all times. So, Probar Live, I\u2019ve given you plenty of love already: Will you please sponsor me?Buy it: Probar Live Probiotic Nutrition Bar, Chocolate Chip Peanut Butter 8-pack, $24 on AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
