Very tasty and SIMPLE.SusanBoise, Idaho1/10/2022Added a shallot, acorn squash, and carrot to the mix as well as a 1/2 tablespoon of Chinese red Chilli powder.  Turned out wonderfully. AnonymousWashington, DC1/2/2022I substituted the chicken thighs with beef, and the rice with barley. Then I grabbed a recipe for beef and barley soup and I made it. It was delicious! ScottLouisville, KY12/23/2021I was beginning to wonder if anyone really made it as written!Anonymous12/23/2021Okay I don't usually love rice in soups since it loses texture but something about this recipe made me think about it constantly until I had to make it tonight. I did the following things after reading comments:\n\n1) doubled the recipe since that was the size of my chicken package\n2) added an extra 2 cups water bc I was worried it'd be too thick and I wanted brothy\n3) used short grain brown rice\n4) added 2 heaping tbs of better than bouillon to the water\n5) used about 6 frozen minced ginger cubes instead of the sliced ginger \n6) added 2 thinly chopped leeks and about 8 oz thinly sliced shiitake mushrooms for extra veg at the time of the sweet potato, which I diced instead of sliced\n7) topped soup with cilantro, jalape\u00f1o, and chopped scallions\n\nFrankly, this soup was delicious and I will probably do the above steps when I make it again!! It didn't even need the extra toppings. The broth tastes incredible. I do think the shiitake mushrooms are a super tasty element that adds to the flavor, though. Yummmmm! AMSSan Diego11/9/2021THIS is my go-to soup ....easy and delicious ! I usually reduce the amount of rice, and increase the ginger to taste. Love this so much! Susan A. RSF, CA4/26/2021Can you use basmati rice instead of jasmine? AnonymousLondon 1/31/2021Andy Baraghani is a wizard.Sam JenningsNashville, TN1/18/2021This is probably my favorite soup EVER. I substitute short pasta like orzo, adding it at the end, instead of the rice. I'm not a fan of wet rice (sorry). It's so comforting, so flavorful and so quick. Ten out of ten, fantastic recipe.Paula P\u00e9rezSpain11/29/2020This turned out great! I made chicken stock thinking I would freeze it and use it later, then decided I wanted soup today since it's cold/ rainy. I didn't have the ingredients for my usual chicken noodle soup so I went searching for something new. I  used leftover rotisserie chicken- breast/ thighs, grated the ginger, sliced the garlic and increased everything since I had 8 c. stock. I used 1 c. rice and it turned out pretty thick but it is delicious. I decreased the soy sauce a bit since the stock was already pretty salty. I had a piece of sourdough toast on the side and inhaled it for dinner. The rest will go into the freezer for another day.amyJacksonville, FL11/20/2020stick a fork in me cause i'm donerainwaterSanta Clara CA11/11/2020Super delicious! Perfect for this cold snowy day. I used skin-on bone-in chicken thighs and fried them first, and then fried up the ginger/garlic and added in some scallions and cilantro stems. I used a little less soy sauce (about 1.5 Tbsp) and only the juice of half a lemon, and didn't add any salt. It was super flavourful! Served with the tops of the scallions, fresh cilantro, and hot sauce. Charlotte Calgary, Alberta11/10/2020I love this soup and make it whenever I have an extra sweet potato lying around. I have found I refer to sear the chicken highs and then cook the garlic and ginger in the chicken drippings and then add liquid, rice, etc....just tastier chicken and richer broth. AnonymousWashington, DC10/12/2020Great recipe; I\u2019ve made this many times, both exactly as stated, and with variations. I find biting into thinly sliced ginger unpleasant. I usually instead make small matchsticks by stacking the slices and running the knife through one more time. If you can find juicy ginger pieces (I\u2019ve noticed these are usually refrigerated), they have a sweeter smell and make a huge difference. I\u2019ve tried grating the ginger, but I find the flavor too strong and also don\u2019t enjoy the resulting texture. I find shredding the chicken with forks to be fussy, especially since you have to wait for it to cool. I\u2019ve just thinly sliced it while still hot and it\u2019s almost as good. I\u2019ve also tried making this with 1-2 tsp of oyster sauce added, which was delicious. AnonymousSan Francisco, CA8/25/2020My husband and I make this soup at least twice a month. We end up doubling the recipe so we have plenty of extra. We always grate the ginger and garlic so that it mixes into the broth better (the ginger flavor is too strong when it's sliced). We also use extra lemon juice and zest a whole lemon. We always top it with a drizzle of hot chili oil along with with the cilantro to add a little heat. Even without any of the extras, it's still such a great recipe.AnonymousHouston, TX8/4/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSoupSoups and StewsChicken ThighChickenPoultryRiceRice & GrainsSweet PotatoPotatoVegetableWinterEasyWeeknight MealsOne-Pot MealsMainDairy-FreeNut-FreeHealthyishSimmerDinnerRecipes you want to make.
