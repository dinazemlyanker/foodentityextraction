It has all the essentials for turning canned tuna (preferably oil-packed and salted) into something truly compelling. Just-enough mayo, capers, and lemon for brightness, celery and onion for crunch, and mustard and (optional) hot sauce for a little extra flavor intrigue. Feel free to sub Greek yogurt for mayo, or pickle relish instead of capers.Ingredients2 large or 4 small servings\u00bcsmall red onion, finely chopped1celery stalk, finely chopped6Tbsp. mayonnaise2Tbsp. coarsely chopped parsley or cilantro2Tbsp. drained capers, finely chopped2tsp. fresh lemon juice1tsp.

The average mayo has 10 grams of fat per tablespoon, which is 30 grams per full serving. The tuna clearly says it's drained, so that averages 3-5 grams per can, which is 1.5 to 2.5 grams per serving. My store-bought bread says it has 2 grams per 2 slices, so 1 sandwich, although the recipe clearly states it can be replaced with lettuce. Whether using the FDA and AHA recommendations for fat intake, 1/2 of this recipe clearly falls well below the fat intake recommendations. Further, remaining meals for the day can be fat-limited. This recipe as written is very good. I personally prefer far less mayo, so that is how I made it, but I otherwise used this recipe. It's a keeper.Debs414Tucson, AZ11/28/2021Really tasty! I admit I switched the mayo for yogurt but you can't taste the difference. The capers really shine with the extra splash of lime. Will make again!FoodNoob11/7/2021Dear God almighty, SIX tablespoons is \"just enough\" mayo for one can of tuna, and you recommend oil-packed tuna on top of that? By the time you include the bread and other ingredients, you're adding more than seventy-five grams of fat beyond what was in the tuna itself.\n\nBy way of comparison, you have added more than two-and-a-half Big Macs-worth of fat to a recipe you claim is just two servings. \ud83e\udd2eAnonymousSomewhereville, USA10/7/2021WHAT is going on with the reviews these days?  If what you have to say it isn't a review of the recipe as made, DON'T POST IT!!!!   What has changed?TIrvToronto, ON5/12/2021This might work for older kids, but I know there\u2019s almost nothing more embarrassing than being the kid with the \u201cstinky\u201d lunch. My 6 yo loves Tuna Salad at home, but many his age find the smell to be gross, I wouldn\u2019t pack this based on the reactions it could get from other kids.AnonymousEastern, KY3/19/2021A nice but often skipped ingredient is a tsp. of horseradish. Used sparingly it adds a new level to the blend. \n\nStephen King \u2014 'The gunslinger had no idea what tooter-fish was, but he knew a popkin when he saw it.'Tooter FishThe Dark Tower2/24/2021Delicius and no need to change anything I use Rio Mare oil packed tuna GillianToronto Canada1/7/2021I like a chopped sweet gherkin and a chopped hard boiled egg in mine, as well.  No need for the capers.DavidPhiladelphia, PA12/22/2020bit too much mayo for my taste.  Key is using tuna in oil.  a touch of sugar helps.

Felt like the ratio between the actual tuna and the other ingredients were off balance. Just ended up using four 5oz. cans of tuna instead of just one, and it was perfect! This is my go-to tuna salad recipe now. Thank you.ChriistieTexas6/3/2020Perfect!AnonymousToronto, Ontario 5/28/2020Delicious. I doubled up on the recipe and add harrisa for a bit of kick, it has an excellent ratio of creamy/crunchy textures and lots of acid to keep it bright.AnonymousVirginia Beach, VA11/20/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladAmericanTunaFishSeafoodEasyMainDairy-FreeLunchRecipes you want to make.
