To make that happen you need to rub them with oil (but don\u2019t wrap them in foil!). And don\u2019t cut them open until you\u2019re ready to eat: If you do, the steam will escape, and they\u2019ll cool down, meaning the butter won\u2019t melt when you put it on\u2014a true tragedy! This is one of the sides from Alison Roman\u2019s \u201cSteak House Night in America\u201d menu, alongside: Martini Bar, Low-and-Slow Rib Roast, The Greatest Creamed Greens, and Upside-Down Apricot Tart.Recipe adapted with permission from Nothing Fancy: Unfussy Food for Having People Over by Alison Roman (Clarkson Potter, an imprint of Penguin Random House, LLC). Copyright \u00a9 2019.\u00a0Ingredients8 servings8medium russet potatoes (about 9 oz. each), scrubbed, patted dryVegetable oil (for potatoes)Kosher saltFreshly ground pepper2cups sour cream1cup finely chopped chives and/or scallions1cup finely chopped dill and/or parsley1cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature1\u20132oz. jar trout or salmon roe or caviarFlaky sea saltPreparationStep 1Place a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 500\u00b0. Prick potatoes all over with a fork (this allows the steam to escape, which helps the insides of the potatoes cook evenly and the skins crisp).Step 2Working one at a time, drizzle a bit of oil over each potato and rub all over with your hands to cover in a thin, even layer; season with kosher salt and pepper. Set potatoes directly on oven rack and bake until the outsides are deeply browned and crisp and the insides are very tender (a paring knife inserted into the flesh should meet no resistance), 60\u201370 minutes.Step 3Using tongs or oven mitts, transfer potatoes to a platter. Set out along with bowls of sour cream, chives, dill, butter, roe, sea salt, and pepper\u2014and whatever else you feel like\u2014and let guests slice open and top to their hearts\u2019 content.How would you rate Baked Potatoes Deluxe?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkExplore Bon App\u00e9titPotatoVegetableCaviarFishSeafoodRusset PotatoEasyWeeknight MealsSideGluten-FreeNut-FreeDinnerRecipes you want to make.
