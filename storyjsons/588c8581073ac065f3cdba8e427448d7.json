There\u2019s air conditioning via the refrigerated shelving situation, responsible sourcing, beautiful produce, well-marbled meats, and even a teensy ice cream shop (technically across the street but still in the family), all at Bi-Rite Market.BUY: local heirloom tomatoes from produce buyer Simon Richard, gouda from cheese buyer Jon Fancey, or whatever else catches your eye. Bi-Rite gives really sweet shout-outs to its very experienced staff (you can\u2019t help but smile reading their bios on the website), and they won\u2019t steer you wrong with edible souvenirs to bring home.THE VIBE IS: fluorescent. It\u2019s still a grocery store! It\u2019s fairly laid-back, though a line can pile up at the deli sandwich counter. Make sure you cap off your grocery run with a scoop of ice cream at Bi-Rite Creamery (Ricanelas, a.k.a. snickerdoodle, is our jam).PRACTICAL STUFF: Check the website for opening hours for the two locations in the Mission and Divisadero and Bi-Rite Creamery\u2019s shop details.\u2014Elyse InamineWE ALSO LOVEHeathThe mother ship for ceramics (and way more)Tartine ManufactoryThe megabakery-slash-wine-bar-slash-ice-cream-shop-slash-restaurantMarchA Pacific Heights shop for the (extremely well-) curated homeExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
