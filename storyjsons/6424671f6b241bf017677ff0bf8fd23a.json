Have I been plagued with soft, unsatisfying roasted brussels sprouts. I try to crank up the heat, coat them with oil and salt, and keep a close eye. But somehow they\u2019re never as good as when restaurants do it. I want crispy edges and a slight crunch, and a slightly sweet caramelized flavor on these mini cabbage heads. But how??? HOW?!!!!!When Molly Baz was working on this new recipe for roasted brussels sprouts with a warm honey glaze, there was a debate in the office about the ideal texture of a roasted sprout. It turns out some people want the BS so crispy they\u2019re no longer soft\u2014at all\u2014while some like a crispy exterior and tender interior. That\u2019s determined by cook time (go close to 35-40 minutes for full crisp). The crispy exterior, however, is achieved by preheating the sheet pan itself in a 450\u00b0 oven. You\u2019re essentially treating the baking sheet like a saut\u00e9 pan, searing an entire side of the brussels sprouts. Without preheating the pan, they\u2019d overcook before they got to the ideal crispy state.That\u2019s pretty much it, honestly. You cut the sprouts in half, toss in olive oil, salt and pepper, and then arrange them cut-side-down on the hot-hot sheet. Use tongs! Move fast. Then they\u2019ll roast for 20-25 minutes, until deeply browned. They\u2019ll be seared on one side, and fully cooked within in that time. But if you\u2019re in senior food editor Chris Morocco\u2019s camp, you might want them to lose all moisture and become completely crunchified, which might take 10-20 more minutes. \u201cLearn your brussels sprout,\u201d Molly advised, looking deeply into my eyes.But we\u2019re not done yet. What seals the deal with this recipe is the warm honey glaze. While the brussels sprouts (or \u201cbrussies\u201d if you\u2019re Molly) roast, heat up honey in a saucepan for around 5 minutes, and then doctor it up with sherry vinegar, red pepper flakes, and butter. It thickens to the consistency of maple syrup at which point you toss it with the brussels sprouts, sliced scallions, and lemon zest. The sweet-spicy-acidic glaze is good on any cruciferous vegetable, noted Molly, like cauliflower, but not so much on already sweet veg like carrots or parsnips.This is the kind of recipe that\u2019s your go-to side all season long. It just goes with everything. Like, dare I say, Thanksgiving turkey. Or a big leg of lamb. Or a bowl of pasta. A weeknight grilled cheese. At some point I have to end that list, and the time is now.Get the recipe:Roasted Brussels Sprouts With Warm Honey GlazeRoasty toasty brussels soak up this delicious honey sauce, creating a combo you just can\u2019t beat.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titbrussels sproutSideRoasted VegetablesRecipes you want to make.
