Each week you\u2019ll hear from one of them: bartender turned brand ambassador Jenny Feldt, wine educator Kyla Peal, line cook Peter Steckler, and farmer Kristyn Leach. Here Leach reflects on how a relationship with one restaurant allows her to diffuse risk and plan for the long term at her farm in Winters, California. Read Leach\u2019s first diary entry here.I have a grower\u2019s contract with Namu Restaurant Group, a group of three restaurants in San Francisco. This means they commit to buying a season\u2019s worth of my produce at Namu Farm, which gives me consistent cash flow. If I have a crop failure, I can tweak what I\u2019m growing later in the season to compensate and adjust to meet the group\u2019s needs too. They recently opened a new restaurant, Sunset Squares Pizza, and it\u2019s been well received so far! Chef Dennis Lee is doing innovative pizzas that use a lot of my Korean-focused crops\u2014he\u2019s doing a galbi jjim pizza. I asked him, \u201cI\u2019d like to try a bitter melon pizza. What do you think?\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019ll make you one, but I don't think the public is going to go for it.\u201d Now I\u2019m starting to think about growing more tomatoes than usual.When you\u2019re a tenant farmer like me who leases their land, there's not a lot of incentive to ask yourself, \u201cWhat is best for this plant, this farm, and this community 10 years from now?\u201d Why bother thinking about that when people are looking for a pristine product instead of investing in a network of relationships? I\u2019m in the Bay Area, and committing to one farmer in a primarily monogamous relationship isn\u2019t that great of an option for chefs. There are so many great farms here and so many farmers markets. But with Namu, we\u2019re committed to each other as people. I don\u2019t really know other farmers that have this level of relationship with a restaurant.Not a lot of farmers have the liberty to tell a restaurant they\u2019re working with, \u201cI might kill half of this crop you asked for,\u201d and still figure out how to get their chef enough produce. But doing this opens up room for me to take risks. Sometimes I say to the chefs at Namu Restaurant Group, \u201cThis crop is not that great this week, but I think I understand why and we\u2019ll get it to a good place.\u201d And they\u2019re okay with that. Their talent and flexibility as chefs makes it possible for me to work in the long term.Photo by Eugene Kan of MaekanSpring is always a time of anticipation, especially this year. Farmers are trying to be optimistic, dreaming about what we\u2019re going to grow. We\u2019re holding our breaths to see whether we will get more rain, and we\u2019re also wondering what will happen if restaurants start reopening here in California. Does that mean other channels for selling produce will start to open up? I\u2019m trying to just surrender to the chaos and not expect anything. Generally, I like to underpromise in the hopes of over-delivering. If I set my expectations low, I feel more content.The biggest concern for everyone out here is that our average rainfall is 50 percent less than it should be, and it\u2019s the second year in a row we\u2019re facing some pretty harsh drought conditions. A big focus of my farm over the past decade has been breeding and adapting crops to be more heat- or drought-tolerant. The way I breed for heat and drought means that sometimes I have to kill 50 percent of the crop by withholding water. It\u2019s a form of very traditional breeding, where you apply deliberate stress for the traits you want to see. But not everyone can do that. Some farmers are just trying to think about what they can feasibly grow right now. For example Korean melons are such a solid heat- and drought-tolerant summer crop for us\u2014people really look forward to them.The big question everyone in the food industry needs to ask themselves is: What other players in our food system need to come in and help shoulder the risk that farmers face? Namu has done that for me from day one. I know they\u2019re just hustling so hard to pay for my produce through the whole year, and I'm so appreciative. We\u2019ve worked together for so long that we\u2019re like family.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurant DiariesRestaurantsFirst PersonRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
