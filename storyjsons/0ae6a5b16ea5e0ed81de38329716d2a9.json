This yer I served it the day after Thanksgiving for the family and it was a hit.  I used Brioche this time and it was equally delicious.  Unfortunately, I\u2019ve forgotten the cr\u00e8me fraiche every time I\u2019ve made it but it\u2019s super delicious without it for sure.  I always serve it with peppers maple bacon to cut some of the sweetness.  You\u2019ll love it!DarlingPhiladelphia, PA11/26/2021Delicious and pretty simple. Challah bread is a great choice! And definitely don't forget the creme for this one! The cool subtle tang is the perfect balance to the rich sweetness of the french toast.TahliaAustin, TX1/10/2019This was super delicious and easy. Assembled on Christmas Eve and baked it Christmas morning. Perfect! AnonymousAtlanta, GA12/25/2018This is a wonderful recipe but a few cautionary notes as a Registered Dietitian.  Eggs can have Salmonella on the outside and inside of the shell.  Letting them sit, even refrigerated overnight can cause Salmonella poisoning as they multiply.  Letting them sit again for 30 minutes makes it even worse and is very risky.  I would suggest only using pasteurized eggs to prevent the overgrowth if Salmonella bacteria.barbrd242Florida 12/21/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titCasseroleCinnamonHerbs & SpicesCardamomEasyVegetarianNut-FreeBreakfastRecipes you want to make.
