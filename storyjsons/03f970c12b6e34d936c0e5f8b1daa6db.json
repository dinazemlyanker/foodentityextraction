The last time I was home with a cold, I trudged forlornly around the kitchen, craving ramen and trying in vain to muster the energy to make some. In my puffy-eyed haze, I thawed a frozen quart of gigante beans rather than the chicken broth I had intended. Feeling truly hopeless, I just dumped some cooked spaghetti into the beans and flavored it with tears of frustration (and a bit of soy sauce).I should have just reached into the pantry for a couple heads of garlic. Unlike chicken or most any other kind of soup, garlic broth requires four ingredients, including water and salt. It is like terrestrial vegan dashi with incredibly deep umami flavor. While simply simmering garlic in water will create a decent broth, toasting some of the garlic cloves in olive oil first helps to amplify their earthy-rich flavor.Start by heating a couple tablespoons of olive oil in a large saucepan over medium. Add 1 head\u2019s worth of peeled, cracked garlic cloves and cook, tossing them around occasionally, until they are golden brown all over, about 10 minutes. Add 2 quarts of water and bring to a simmer. While the water is heating, grab a handful of fresh herbs (if you have them) like parsley, cilantro, sage, or scallions, and add them to the pot, along with one more head of garlic halved crosswise. Gently boil until reduced by about \u00bc and garlic cloves are super soft, 30\u201340 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. At this point you can strain it, or just pass a wide slotted spoon through it a few times to fish the garlic and herbs out. You can add pasta to it, drizzle in some whisked eggs to make stracciatella, float toast on it (rubbed with even more raw garlic), or just drink it.We kept the flavor profile neutral so that it will work with nearly any other ingredients, but other pantry staples like dried shiitakes, kombu, crushed ginger, or soy sauce (instead of salt) would be welcome additions. I\u2019m not saying this broth will make you look forward to sick days, but at least you won\u2019t go hungry or try to cook something too complicated.
