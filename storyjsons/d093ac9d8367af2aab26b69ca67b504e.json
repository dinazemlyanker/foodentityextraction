(That is, if you don\u2019t speak Italian. Sorry @Italiansmadatfood!) What we have here is a classic Italian dish of pasta in a lemon-cream sauce. Heavy cream. The good stuff.Recently, editor in chief Adam Rapoport had the pappardelle al limone at I Sodi in New York, a Bon App\u00e9tit staff favorite Italian restaurant/pasta temple, and honestly, he wouldn\u2019t shut up about it. What makes it so special? \u201cButter,\u201d he told me. Yet it feels lighter than heavy cream sauce, he added, while another staffer called it \u201calfredo for people in denial.\u201d Digital director Carey Polis is maybe the biggest fan: \u201cI mean, this sounds ridiculous but I really do feel this way: I lived in Italy for a year where I ate a pretty absurd amount of pasta, but I can\u2019t think of one I crave or love more than the pappardelle al limone from I Sodi.\u201d She wrote a book blurb for a plate of pasta, people! Sometimes we fixate on meals like this. We realized we didn\u2019t have a recipe, and needed one ASAP. Molly Baz was assigned to develop it, coincidentally tweaking small factors\u2014the shape of the pasta, the amount of lemon zest\u2014so we had to keep trying it, over and over.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.But at its core, it\u2019s as simple as cacio e pepe, an uncomplicated weeknight dinner that sustains and comforts. That\u2019s a nice way of saying GIMME THE CARBSSSSS. Our sauce is the zest of a whole lemon (crucial for the unique, bright acidity of the final product), \u00be cup heavy cream, and butter. It emulsifies with some pasta water (the secret to restaurant-glossy pasta at home, another obsession of ours), and once you add the al dente noodles, it gets even creamier with the incremental addition of Parmesan. A final squeeze of lemon juice at the end \u201cmakes the fat...pop,\u201d explained Molly, which, uh, is a good thing. It brightens up the supremely creamy sauce and the touch of acidity is what keeps you coming back for twirl after twirl. Don\u2019t skimp on the salt to keep the balance in check.Technique-wise, I talked to Molly about the line in the recipe about the cream sauce \u201ctightening up,\u201d which is a bad thing. Translation: When a cream sauce cools, it thickens and loses its sauciness (like me at the fifth hour of your wedding). So you might end up using more starchy pasta water than usual to make up for that. Save two cups of pasta water to be sure!A note on noods: We tested with pappardelle, but found different brands were inconsistent, some thicker than others, shorter than others. A short noodle isn\u2019t as satisfying to twirl into the sauce, and some thinner noodles broke into pieces in the thick sauce. We went with De Cecco spaghetti (our favorite), but any long noodle option will work.
