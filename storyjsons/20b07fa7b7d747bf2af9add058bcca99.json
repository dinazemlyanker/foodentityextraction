Skirt steak is one of our all-time favorite cuts\u2014it's nice and thin, so all you have to do is sear it hard for a couple of minutes on each side and the interior will be a perfect medium-rare, no thermometer required. And salsa verde? Just our go-to, all-purpose condiment, ideal for waking up everything from grilled veggies to steamed fish to roasted meat. And crispy-edged, olive oil-fried eggs? Well, those need no introduction. Breakfast for dinner never looked so good.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Pat steak dry with paper towels and place on a plate. Season generously all over with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Let rest at room temperature while you make the salsa verde. Usually you want steak to sit out at least 1 hour to cook more evenly, but with skirt steak, it\u2019s okay to cut down on that time because it cooks so quickly.Step 2Pick leaves and tender stems from 1 small bunch of parsley and finely chop to make \u00be cup. Transfer to a medium bowl. While we love a parsley-based salsa verde, you can mix it up with any tender, flavorful leafy things you have on hand\u2014cilantro, dill, watercress, and/or arugula make for a tasty sauce, too.Step 3Using a Microplane, finely grate 1 garlic clove and 1 tsp. lemon zest into bowl with parsley.Step 4Squeeze 1 lemon half into bowl (make sure no seeds get in there) to yield about 4 tsp.Step 5Coarsely chop 1 Tbsp. capers and add to bowl. Mix in \u00bd tsp. red pepper flakes, \u00bd tsp. sugar, and \u00bd cup extra-virgin olive oil. Season with salt. Set salsa verde aside until ready to serve. If you like a looser sauce, add a bit more oil to thin it out.Step 6Heat a large cast-iron skillet over high. Pat steaks dry again with paper towels. You really want it to be as dry as possible; this will help you get the nice brown crust you're after. Rub a bit of extra-virgin olive oil all over steak, just to lightly coat.Step 7Once pan is nice and hot, using tongs, gently lay steak in pan. Working in 2 batches, cook, undisturbed, until a golden brown crust forms, 2\u20133 minutes. Turn steak and cook until second side forms a golden brown crust, about 2 minutes longer. You don\u2019t need to use a meat thermometer here because the steak is so thin; a general rule is that once it has a nice sear, it\u2019s already perfectly cooked. If you have a very hot pan, this will happen quickly.Step 8Transfer steaks to a cutting board as you go. Wipe out skillet. Let steak rest 10 minutes.Step 9While steak rests, pour enough oil into skillet to coat bottom of pan and heat over medium. (Don't have a well-seasoned cast-iron pan? You might want to consider switching to a non-stick for this part.) Immediately crack 4 large eggs into pan. (You don\u2019t need to wait for the oil to heat up because there\u2019s already a lot of residual heat in the pan from when you cooked the steak.)Step 10Cook eggs, undisturbed, until edges are crispy, whites are set, and yolks are still runny, 4\u20136 minutes. Using a spatula, transfer to a paper towel-lined plate; season with salt.Step 11Slice steak against the grain, then transfer to a platter. Arrange eggs alongside steak. Drizzle salsa verde over steak and eggs. Serve remaining salsa verde alongside.How would you rate Steak and Eggs with Salsa Verde?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleThis was great.  Great Friday night dinner.  Just be careful, parsley is not listed in ingredient list. The salsa was tasty over mashed potatoes also.   DarcyFolsom11/21/2021Delicious! I'd say the sauce was more of a chimichurri than a salsa verde though. I added a little more lemon juice to it and it really paired well with the steak. Would make again!Anonymous3/16/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSteakBeefMeatEggWeeknight MealsEasyMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreeKetoBreakfastLunchDinnerBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
