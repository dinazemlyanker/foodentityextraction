What could be better?By Elyse InamineMarch 12, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailThe only thing better than a good recipe? When something's so easy to make that you don't even need one. Welcome to It's That Simple, a column where our staffers talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks that they can make with their eyes closed.Welcome to the tail-end of winter. It\u2019s that specific point in the season when the magic of snow has worn off and my fridge is full of cabbage and turnips that I can\u2019t bring myself to turn into a mushy braise for tonight's dinner. It\u2019s bleak. But then I remember: Hope lies in my pantry. After digging through packets of instant ramen and Costco bags of dried fruit, I find my stash of the ingredient that is always in season and always delightful: SPAM.Say what you will of Spam, but you cannot deny that it tastes pretty good. And it reaches peak deliciousness when fried up in its own mystery meat fat and soy sauce, layered with hot white rice and furikake (Japan\u2019s savory sprinkles), and wrapped up in earthy, crackly nori (Japanese dried seaweed). This, my friends, is Spam musubi, Hawaii\u2019s all-occasion, all-season snack. And this is what I\u2019m eating tonight.In Hawaii, where my dad grew up and much of my extended family still lives, Spam musubi is everywhere. It\u2019s on regular rotation at any family gathering, from New Year\u2019s day parties to football games. My mom, who is not from Hawaii, eventually added Spam musubi to her own repertoire, making it for my elementary school class parties and any gathering we had in the Inamine household. When I moved to New York, she sent me along with a Spam musubi press\u2014people in Hawaii do not joke around\u2014so I could live that Spam musubi lifestyle even thousands of miles away from the homeland. Now it\u2019s become the antidote to my winter cooking blues, an absolute unit of carbs and calories that\u2019s unabashedly salty and fatty and joy-filled. And here\u2019s how it can become yours, too.Start by cooking about 2 cups of short-grain white rice (here\u2019s how). While that\u2019s going on, open up one can of low-sodium Spam and shimmy it out of the container\u2014but don\u2019t toss the packaging just yet. Now slice the meat into 6\u20138 rectangular pieces, depending on how thick you want your Spam (I prefer mine thinner). Throw the Spam slices into a hot nonstick pan, frying and flipping until each side has patches of golden-brown deliciousness. Then turn off the heat and add a splash of soy sauce, letting the sugars in the sauce caramelize and cling to the Spam in a thick glaze (if the sauce starts to look burnt and smell toasty, just dump everything onto a plate). Set the Spam aside and start tearing nori sheets so they\u2019re about the width of the can (usually it works to just rip the sheets in half).Once the rice is cooked and slightly cooled and the Spam container rinsed, it\u2019s time to assemble. Take one torn sheet of nori and place 2\u20133 tablespoons of rice in the center (you can adjust your Spam-to-rice ratio; I like mine even). Smash down on the rice with the bottom side of can so the rice is flat and Spam-container-shaped, then sprinkle some furikake (I like this brand since it\u2019s less fishy and adds another dimension of nori flavor) and place one slice of Spam on top. Add a little more furikake and 2\u20133 more tablespoons of rice, then gently smash the rice with the can so the surface is even. Fold both sides of the nori over the final rice layer and seal the edges with water. Congrats: You\u2019ve made your first Spam musubi! Repeat this process with the remaining Spam slices, then either eat as little logs or cut them into thirds and finish with a little more furikake on the cut sides, like my mom does.I bet that before you\u2019ve even finished your musubi, you\u2019ll be browsing the web for a press of your own that will serve you all through the rest of winter (and beyond).Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimpleRecipes you want to make.
