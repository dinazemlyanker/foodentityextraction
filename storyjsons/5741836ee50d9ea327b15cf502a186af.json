We asked 80 of the most interesting people we know to reveal the local spots they love the most.In October 2014, I left my job as special projects editor at Bon App\u00e9tit to travel the world. What was supposed to be a six-month trip lasted three-and-a-half years and took my partner and me all over Asia, Australia, North America, and the Arctic. For 16 of those 42 months, we crisscrossed the U.S. by car, visiting 40 states and nearly 150 cities in the process.The first time we road-tripped across America, it was early 2016\u2014an election year. But not just any election year. The most divisive election year in U.S. history. We saw a lot of Trump signs. We saw a lot of Bernie signs. We did not see a lot of Hillary signs.The second time we drove coast to coast, from August 2017 to February 2018, Trump was president and a tense new mood gripped the country. Some people were elated, others were devastated. Each time we crossed a new state line, we did a quick mental calculation: red, blue, or purple? Sometimes the billboards and bumper stickers told us; sometimes I had to look it up.But here\u2019s the thing about America: There\u2019s no such thing as a \u201cred\u201d or a \u201cblue\u201d state. From a strategically divisive, vote-counting perspective, sure. But on a multidimensional human level, things are a lot more complex and messy. Politics, like people, are not monolithic, and who we are is not dictated by where we live or even how we vote. Even the deepest \u201cred\u201d and darkest \u201cblue\u201d states contain endless diversity, and as people who fell squarely on the \u201cdevastated blue\u201d end of the political spectrum, seeking out that difference, that which disproved the crude generalizations of the electoral map, kept us grounded throughout our travels. And the best way to do that was through food.It\u2019s no surprise that you can find authentic Szechuan in New York City, Indonesian street eats in Chicago, or Yemeni home cooking in San Francisco. What\u2019s more heartening was seeing immigrants set up mom-and-pop restaurants and tiny grocery stores beyond the big, predictable cities. In 16 months of U.S. travel, our most memorable meals included a Bosnian feast in Tucson, Arizona (Chef Alisah\u2019s Restaurant); Afghani food in Fort Collins, Colorado (Maza Kabob); Salvadoran in Lexington, Nebraska (El Rinconcito); Guinean in Lexington, Kentucky (Sav\u2019s Grill); Jordanian in Fayetteville, Arkansas (Petra Cafe); Kurdish in St. Paul, Minnesota (Babani\u2019s); East African in Fargo, North Dakota (Rugsan); Venezuelan in Madison, Wisconsin (La Taguara); Ethiopian in Memphis, Tennessee (Derae Restaurant); and Korean in Anniston, Alabama (Cafe Korea) and Cheyenne, Wyoming (Korean House).One thing we always noticed about these neighborhood eateries was that they weren\u2019t just places to fill your belly; they were community hubs for their respective diasporas. This was where you went to eat the food of your homeland (or your parents\u2019 or grandparents\u2019 homeland), to speak in your native tongue, and to bond over shared history and experience. It\u2019s where you found job leads and babysitters, traded cooking tips, complained about your favorite sports teams, or advertised social events. The atmosphere was convivial, familial. And even though we were clearly outsiders\u2014ethnically, culturally, geographically\u2014we were always welcomed with open arms.Most of these restaurants were family-run affairs. When we stopped for dinner at African Safari Restaurant in Amarillo, Texas, the man running the front-of-house proudly introduced us to his wife of more than 20 years, who handled all the cooking. He spoke in halting English, and we never did catch his name, but we know why he was beaming: Her tender, crispy-fried goat meat, served on the bone atop a bed of spiced basmati rice, was easily one of the best meals we would eat in 2016. The Somali, Sudanese, Kenyan, Ethiopian, and Nigerian men occupying the tables around us also flashed big smiles of approval. We had found their spot.If we\u2019d had more time on the ground in Amarillo, we would have gone back the next day for a breakfast of boiled beef liver with injera and hot tea, but we had so much more to explore. Up and down the mile-long eating corridor of East Amarillo Boulevard were Thai, Vietnamese, Cuban, Salvadoran, and Mexican restaurants. We tucked into a plate of Laotian beef jerky at Ly\u2019s Cafe, bought ingredients to make lahpet thoke (fermented tea leaf salad) at the Burmese grocery store Aye San Bu, and resigned ourselves to adding green \u201cwant to go\u201d flags to our Google Map for everything else.These ethnic food hubs popped up time and again throughout the country\u2014along Atlanta\u2019s Buford Highway; in the Gateway District of Las Vegas; in the New Orleans suburb of Gretna; and in the culinary gold mine of Boise, Idaho. (Seriously, you have not lived until you\u2019ve dug into the Eritrean tibs firfir at Kibrom\u2019s, Iraqi lamb qwzi at The Goodness Land, and traditional pintxos at The Basque Market). In Omaha, Nebraska, we hoovered up peanut butter lamb stew with fufu at Chaima African Cuisine, opened in 2012 by a talented mother of four from Togo. Fifteen minutes across town, we shared a delightful wafers-and-buttercream Napoleon torte laced with apricot from Lithuanian Bakery, founded in 1962 by a married couple and now run by their three sons. The two businesses have more in common than either probably realizes. Moving to a foreign country, learning a new language, adapting to a strange culture, putting food on the table for yourself and others\u2014these experiences are universally challenging.It\u2019s worth noting that we didn\u2019t stumble upon these neighborhood-y places and the communities they serve by accident. We sought them out. In what continues to be tumultuous political times (at least in our minds), restaurants like these and the kindhearted people who run them give us hope. They are a reminder of what America was built upon, and that it is the coming together of the stories of real people\u2014in all their beautiful messiness and complexity\u2014that truly makes it great.Ashlea Halpern is a no-longer-nomadic writer living in Minnesota.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Explore Bon App\u00e9titNeighborhood RestaurantsRecipes you want to make.
