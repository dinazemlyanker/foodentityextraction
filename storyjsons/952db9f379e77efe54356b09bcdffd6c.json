Well, That DependsWhether you want light and fluffy or dense and creamy, these potatoes get the gold medal in mash.By Nico AvalleNovember 11, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhotograph by Emma Fishman, Food styling by Susie Theodorou, prop styling by Sophie LengFacebookTwitterEmailAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

No matter how much melted butter, sour cream, or white pepper you add, if the tubers are gummy or grainy, your dish is a goner. Meanwhile, start with superb spuds and the rest is, pardon our pun, gravy.So what are the best potatoes for mashing?We consider Yukon Gold potatoes the best choice for classic dense mashed potatoes. Their rich texture and subtle creaminess make them great for all of your mashing needs. A true all-purpose potato, they\u2019re also good for shredding, roasting, grilling, blending (?!), and shingling. So when you\u2019re shopping for your Thanksgiving, Friendsgiving, or really any occasion that calls for the smoothest, creamiest side dish imaginable, keep an eye out for their bright yellow skins.According to senior food editor Christina Chaey, there\u2019s a few reasons Yukons get BA\u2019s gold medal in mashing year after year. \u201cFor starters, Yukon Golds have a naturally buttery flavor compared to other common potatoes, so you have a richer tasting natural potato from the get-go,\u201d she says. That buttery flavor will only get boosted when it comes time to add actual butter or cream leading to perfect mashed potatoes in the end. \u201cYukon Golds also have a tendency to absorb less water than most other potatoes [as they cook], so they don\u2019t run the same risk of getting water-logged or gummy,\u201d Chaey points out.What other potatoes are good for mashing?Whereas Yukon Golds are considered medium-starch potatoes, russet potatoes are high-starch potatoes. That starchiness leads to mashes that are on the lighter and fluffier side. Unlike Yukon Golds, which produce dense, rich scoops of super creamy mashed potatoes, russets turn out pillowy and soft.While many recipes call for russets to be peeled, cubed, and boiled before they\u2019re mashed, we actually prefer a no-boil oven method, which ensures these extra-starchy potatoes don\u2019t take on too much water. Roast the potatoes whole until totally tender, then remove the skin, mash the flesh, and incorporate melted butter and half-and-half (or heavy cream). Careful, though: Overworking cooked russet potatoes (say, by throwing them in a food processor) will release too much starch, turning them into a sticky glom.If you\u2019re feeling indecisive, you can always use both, like we do in this recipe for mashed baked potatoes. Yukon Golds and russets are baked side by side on high heat and mashed together into sweet, silky harmony, then loaded with chives, roasted garlic, and black pepper for a side that brings the best of both worlds.What\u2019s the best tool for mashing potatoes?You\u2019ve got the good potatoes, now what? The best tool for mashing depends on the type of mash you\u2019re looking for, the mashed potato recipe you're following, and (last but far from least), the amount of storage space you have:Potato MasherLo-fi, cheap, and easy to store, we love a good old-fashioned potato masher\u2014provided that you don\u2019t mind a mash with a few lumps. (Just call it \u201crustic.\u201d) If you don\u2019t have a masher, a fork can get the job done, Chaey says.OXO Potato Masher$14 at AmazonRicerFor the smoothest, most uniform mash possible, you\u2019ll need a potato ricer. Picture a garlic press\u2019s big sister and you\u2019re on the right track. Passing your boiled spuds through a ricer will reduce them to uniform shreds in seconds\u2014good news for you because spending too much time mashing can lead to gummy results even if you start with the right potatoes. Remember: Yukons are more forgiving than most potatoes, but just like you and me, every tater has its limits.Stainless Steel Potato Ricer$14 at AmazonFood MillThis old-school contraption breaks down potatoes with an efficiency similar to a ricer, but can also be used to make jam, tomato sauce, and all kinds of smooth homogenous things. The downside? It takes up more space and is kind of a pain to clean.Food Mill$50 at AmazonFood Processor/Stand MixerIt\u2019s a trick! Never, under any circumstance, do you want to make mashed potatoes with either of these devices, which will overwork cooked potatoes into a gummy, gluey mess. Trust us on this one.Bonus Option: Veggie PeelerIf you\u2019re using a ricer or food mill, say goodbye to those skins, which won\u2019t make it through the small holes of the machine. Otherwise, you\u2019ve got a choice: Removing the potato peels will make for a more uniform texture, but there\u2019s also nothing wrong with leaving your peels intact for a bit of homestyle charm. If you do choose to ditch those peels, we prefer a Y-style peeler, which will tidily shuck the skin from any fruit and veggie while leaving the skin on your fingers completely intact.Vegetable Peeler$10 at AmazonLike your toppings and mix-ins, the tools you use are pretty much a matter of taste. In truth, the same can be said for all things mashed potatoes: Fluffy and light or dense and buttery, it\u2019s up to you to choose a direction for your dish. And once you do pick a lane, choosing the right types of potatoes is simple. Now that you have the answers in hand, the best mashed potatoes you could possibly imagine are in reach.Comfort food goals:Garlic-Miso Butter Mashed PotatoesMellow roasted garlic and sweet-salty miso paste bring big flavor to this buttery, easy-to-love mash.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
