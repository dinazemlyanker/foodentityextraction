They light up my life! They won\u2019t burn your house down!By Hilary CadiganJuly 8, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Allie WistFacebookTwitterEmailAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Go ahead, talk to me about wick trimming (\u00bc to \u215b of an inch, every time you burn). Or tunneling (the first time you light a candle, let it burn until the entire top layer liquifies, to prevent that hole-in-the-center situation. And if it DOES start to tunnel because you didn\u2019t heed this advice, put tin foil over the top, with a hole for the wick, to more evenly distribute heat and melt the offending wax walls.)Anyway, I light candles at dinner, during my Zoom dance meditations, and any time people are coming over and I need to pretend I change my cats\u2019 litter box as often as one is supposed to. I love candles for the instant vibe they create, the way they transform my shitty apartment or unkempt back patio into a sexy flickering grotto, ready to seduce both my guests and my own fragile psyche into thinking said space is much nicer than it actually is.But here\u2019s the problem. Or rather, the problems. Candles are expensive. They constantly need replacing. They drip wax everywhere. They release tiny particles into the air that, en masse, aren\u2019t exactly great for your cardiovascular and respiratory health. They put you at risk of burning down your own house. And, when a cat drags his tail through one, it\u2019s a situation.All these issues didn\u2019t exactly deter me from my candle habit, but they did have me seeking possible alternatives to the real thing. Which led me to an additional problem: Fake candles mostly sucked. Like those horrible little white plastic hockey pucks with that sad, frozen facsimile of flame that give off very little light and absolutely no flicker. If these were fake candles, forget it, I'd take my chances with a singed cat tail.Then, during a cabin weekend upstate a few months ago, my friend Paco whipped out a box. \u201cI have a surprise,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a very good one.\u201dOut of the box he pulled three white wax cylinders of varying heights. He placed them around the room and pulled out a tiny remote control. Then, with a flourish, he pointed it like a magic wand at each of the candles in turn. And one by one\u2014behold!\u2014each cylinder lit up with a flickering brilliance that looked\u2026well, exactly like a real candle. Had I not seen with my own eyes the wizardly way in which they burst into light at the press of a button, I would have been sure they were real.Waterproof Flickering Flameless Candles$30 $23 at AmazonThe secret behind these magic faux candles is their little moving wicks: a piece of plastic lit from below and loosely balanced on a thin wire so it waves around at random like a real flame. It sounds janky, I know, and the photo that accompanies this article isn\u2019t exactly strengthening my case, but put these ladies in a dark room and prepare to be amazed. They\u2019re battery-operated (opt for rechargeable to keep it sustainable) and will give you 500+ hours of light on a single pair of AAs. You can even adjust the brightness and flicker level by remote.Best of all, they\u2019re waterproof, which, in addition to the fact that they won\u2019t start a forest fire, makes them especially useful for outdoor events (weddings! picnics! the pool party I\u2019ll be hosting soon to celebrate the arrival of my 2-to-4-person inflatable hot tub!). And because they\u2019re less than $20 for a set of three, I can buy many for the cost of a single expensive real candle, getting me closer and closer to recreating that scene at the end of the Baz Lurhmann version of Romeo+Juliet, minus the death part. What vibes!And sure, these candles will not burn away the shameful smell of a less-than-fresh litter box. But they also won\u2019t explode wax all over you and your cat when he knocks them, and himself, into the bathtub while you\u2019re trying to have a romantic night at home alone. Nor will they light his tail on fire, even if he deserves it.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
