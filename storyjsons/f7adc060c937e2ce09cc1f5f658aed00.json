In Ethiopia, it\u2019s a milk-less spice infused tea; in Kashmir, it\u2019s salty and steeped in a samovar; in Starbucks, it\u2019s a syrupy, saccharine, pre-mixed blend (people, why are you still drinking this stuff?)! But in the Krishna house, chai is typically a milky, English breakfast tea made earthy and aromatic with any combination of fresh ginger, cardamom pods, peppercorns, and cinnamon sticks.For my mom, a pro-level, self-taught home cook, the significance of chai is not the execution of a precise recipe but the function it serves in her life. Her basic recipe comes from how her family drank chai when she was growing up in northern India, but she\u2019s been making it since she immigrated to America in 1980. Chai has always been my mom\u2019s moment to breathe\u2014when she returns from her walk, when we\u2019ve just done a big shopping trip, when she gets back from a vacation, and lately, when she\u2019s helping her daughter (me) test recipes for a cookbook but needs a second to recalibrate after coming home from work.\u201cBut first,\u201d she always tells my nagging, impatient self, her voice perfectly calm, \u201cI\u2019ve got to have my chai.\u201dOn most days, her chai routine is the same\u2014a pared down, every day method that doesn\u2019t require any saucepans or fancy strainers. She boils water, and adds it to a flowery porcelain mug (the only one she\u2019ll use for chai, as it\u2019s exactly the right serving size) containing a bag of Tetley, a British brand of black tea with a cultish following in India\u2014my mom likes its extra strong flavor. Then she crushes a few whole cardamom pods in a mortar and pestle, and throws them into the tea, along with a spoonful of sugar and a few dabs of milk.The exceptions to her usual chai habits are on exceptionally cold or sick days, when she makes her extra-fortified chai. For this version, she crushes fresh ginger and some black peppercorns, maybe throwing in some cinnamon sticks for good measure; then she strains out the spices, and adds her usual milk and sugar. Each version she makes differs based on what\u2019s in the house. This is the chai you make when your throat needs some extra TLC, or when you need something to make your whole body feel cozy when the temperature drops under 40 degrees (note: my mom lives in Texas).Yet another variation involves adding a few squirts of honey and two to three thin slices of lime into black tea as it steeps\u2014the tea is served hot, but has slightly more refreshing notes, making it a pleasant summer drink.  Maybe some people don\u2019t count that under their definition of chai; but chai, in Hindi, just translates to \u201ctea.\u201d It doesn\u2019t necessitate any specific combination of ingredients. For my mom, if it\u2019s warm and it invigorates your soul, it counts.Click to enlarge.\nDesign by Alaina SullivanPriya Krishna\u2019s cookbook Indian-ish, documenting her journey of learning to make the distinct, hybridized cuisine of her chic, extremely skilled-in-the-kitchen mom, Ritu, will be out from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in April 2019.
