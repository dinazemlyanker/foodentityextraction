Cook corn and 1 poblano chile in a dry medium cast-iron skillet over high heat, turning occasionally, until corn is charred in spots and chile is blistered all over, 10\u201314 minutes.Step 2Transfer corn and chile to a cutting board and let cool for a minute or two. Lay corn flat and slice along one side to shave off kernels. Repeat, rotating cob, until all kernels have been cut off. Discard cobs. Transfer corn to a medium bowl.Step 3Crush corn with a potato masher or wooden spoon to help release starch and juices, which will help to thicken the salsa slightly. (Also a good way to get out a little aggression.)Step 4Cut around poblano chile stem to remove, then slice into flesh lengthwise to open up chile like a book. Scrape out seeds and ribs, flip over, then use the dull edge of your knife to scrape off charred skin and discard.Step 5Coarsely chop chile and add to bowl with corn.Step 6Do a little bit more knife work: Cut stem end off of 1 jalape\u00f1o, then halve lengthwise. Pull out ribs and seeds, then finely chop flesh. Add to bowl with corn.Step 7Finely chop \u00bd red onion and add to bowl as well. Season with \u00bd tsp. salt and give it all a good mix with a large spoon.Step 8Core 1 tomato, then cut in half through its equator. Squeeze tomato halves over a bowl or trash to push out seeds and watery parts and discard. Chop tomato flesh and gently fold into salsa.Step 9Pick \u00bc cup cilantro leaves from stems. Very finely chop leftover stems and fold into salsa along with leaves.Step 10Cut 1 lime in half and squeeze with your hands into a small bowl. Measure out 2 Tbsp. and add to corn mixture. Taste and season with more salt. Mix one more time to combine.Step 11Arrange tortilla chips on a platter. Serve corn salsa alongside.Step 12Do Ahead: Corn salsa, without cilantro, can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Stir in herbs right before serving.How would you rate Corn Salsa?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (3)Back to TopTriangleThis recipe is a keeper 5 stars!\nServed as part of an appetizer before the main.\nAll of it was gone!\nNo leftovers!
