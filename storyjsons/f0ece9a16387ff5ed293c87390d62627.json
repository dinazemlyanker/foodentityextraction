Instead they\u2019re ones like Les Vignes de Babass\u2019 \u201cRoc Cab\u201d Cabernet Franc, which I drank on a bright Saturday afternoon over a long lunch with good friends and a party sub my husband made with homemade \u2018nduja, mozzarella, arugula, and zucchini. The wine and the sandwich paired surprisingly well, and I didn\u2019t have to think too hard about it: just good people, good wine, and good times. (Yes, I know that sounds like something that should be\u2014and probably is\u2014emblazoned in glitter on plastic goblets, but it\u2019s true.)I love Cabernet Franc and have drank a lot of it.  No joke, I had a 30-minute one woman show called \u201cFrom Franzia to Cab Franc\u201d back when I was performing comedy. What I\u2019ve found with many Cabernet Francs is that they\u2019re either yawnable, with the textbook-taste of green bell pepper (thanks to aromatic compounds called pyrazines), or they are wild as hell. The latter type still have pyrazines, but they drink like off-roading through rocky cow manure with splashes of cheap red wine vinegar. What I\u2019m saying is: It isn\u2019t easy to find a Cab Franc that is both interesting and well-balanced.But Les Vignes de Babass\u2019 \u201cRoc Cab\u201d is. With its flirting acidity that hits you on the tip of your tongue to its velvety vibrato finish, \u201cRoc Cab\u201d is Doris Day serenading with a big band. It begs you to sway with it, to lose yourself in its flavors of smashed, ripe blueberries and diced jalape\u00f1o while waltzing down a winding gravel drive sprinkled with white flower petals. It would kill with whatever you\u2019re cooking for dinner, I\u2019m sure. But while there are plenty of wines to pair with roast chicken, I can only think of one wine that can hold up to a 2 p.m. party sub...and this Cab Franc is it.Les Vignes de Babass\u2019 \u201cRoc Cab\u201d Cabernet Franc is imported by Camille Rivier\u00e9 and was purchased at Psychic Wines in Los Angeles for $36.Buy it: Les Vignes de Babass\u2019 \u201cRoc Cab\u201d Cabernet Franc, $31.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
