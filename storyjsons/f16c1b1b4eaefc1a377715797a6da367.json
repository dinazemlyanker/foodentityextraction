Here, in his mushroom toque, the chef serves shrimp de Jonghe, roasted chicken smothered in bell peppers and pepperoncini, and crispy cottage fries with every steak. It\u2019s a menu that\u2019s hauntingly familiar to anyone who\u2019s ever dined at the restaurant godfather of red sauce Chicago, Gene & Georgetti.That\u2019s not a coincidence. Aucaquizhpi was a 20-year veteran of the latter, the city\u2019s most venerated Italian steakhouse. But Mirabella, staffed almost entirely by Ecuadoran immigrants like Aucaquizhpi, is nothing like Gene & Georgetti. For one thing, it\u2019s not as expensive. But more strikingly, here on the blue-collar northwest side, the average Joe and Jane will never get a stiff greeting and a table in Siberia as they might downtown.Twenty-seven years ago, when Aucaquizhpi left his home village in south Andean Ecuador for Chicago, he was 16 and barely spoke a word of English. He soon took a job clearing tables and refilling water glasses at the Erie Caf\u00e9, an upstart Italian steakhouse in Chicago\u2019s River North neighborhood. Today he\u2019s the upstart.A weathered old German restaurant on the northwest side is now Chicago's newest old-school red sauce joint.\nPhoto by Jeff MariniWhen Aucaquizhpi worked those first shifts at the Erie Caf\u00e9, it had just been opened by the grandson of Eugene (Gene) Michelotti, the onetime dishwasher, bartender, and first-generation Italian immigrant cofounder of Gene & Georgetti. Haunted by decades of canoodling mobsters, politicians, and celebrities, G&G was Exhibit A for the city\u2019s (even then undeserved) reputation as an expense-account convention feedlot. Located just a half mile from G&G, the Erie Caf\u00e9 put a new spin on the old vibe, but still featured the same Italian-American steakhouse standards: thick chops, saucy pastas, mussels marinara, and the iconic \u201cgarbage salad,\u201d a mountain of chopped iceberg, salami, cheese, and shrimp.It was a matter of months before Aucaquizhpi was plating those salads and working the pantry and saut\u00e9 station. He was making more money than he\u2019d ever seen and helping his father, a Gene & Georgetti dishwasher, make rent and bring his mother and siblings to the U.S. Life was good, so in 1997 when the call came from Gene & Georgetti executive chef Mario Navarro, he hesitated. The restaurant was expanding its second-floor dining room to accommodate the overflow of no-names, and Navarro needed cooks. (Sidenote: In 23 years I\u2019ve been seated in the coveted downstairs dining room exactly once\u2014at three in the afternoon in an otherwise empty restaurant.)Navarro remembered when Aucaquizhpi was new to town and came in one night to help his father work a large private party held in honor of a prominent local racketeer. He \u201cjust stood by with the bus pans and looked at me because I was too strong in my voice calling the orders,\u201d Navarro says. \u201cArturo was shaking. He\u2019d never been in a kitchen.\u201dBut after four years at the Erie Caf\u00e9, it was an easy transition. Navarro, who\u2019d started at Gene & Georgetti in 1976, saw something in the young cook. \u201cHe worked with me 15 years,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s the only kid I teach everything I know, because I know he loves to cook. I said, \u2018Arturo, when I\u2019m retiring, you gonna take my place.\u2019\u201dIt didn\u2019t hurt that after Aucaquizhpi mastered the 60-plus dishes on G&G\u2019s menu, he\u2019d taken a prep shift at nearby Piccolo Sogno and learned how to butcher whole animals, stuff a mean porchetta, and make fresh pasta. \u201cHe wanted to learn the Italian kitchen a little better,\u201d says Piccolo Sogno\u2019s chef, Tony Priolo. \u201cAnd I learned from him. He\u2019s a hardworking guy.\u201dAucaquizhpi drew on that training to make his own imprint on the menu at Gene & Georgetti, introducing fresh-rolled cavatelli in vodka sauce. Meanwhile, after 36 years in the kitchen, Navarro (now living the sweet life in Puerto Vallarta), was getting ready to take a bow. \u201cI said to the boss, \u2018I am retiring. Arturo\u2019s ready.\u2019\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no simple feat to be in the kitchen at Gene & Georgetti when 600 people go through that restaurant on a Saturday. [Aucaquizhpi\u2019s] got his eye on every steak,\u201d says Michelle Durpetti, whose father\u2014in a typically knotty Italian-American family tie\u2014married Gene Michelotti\u2019s daughter and later bought G&G from his mother-in-law. \u201cAnd still he took the time to learn how to make pasta.\u201dWhile Aucaquizhpi took over the ordering, butchering, and expediting, not many knew he had his eyes on another prize. \u201cI wanted something for myself,\u201d he says.\u201cHe secretly opened his own place and surprised everybody,\u201d Priolo says. Aucaquizhpi scouted locations for a year before he found one in his own northwest side neighborhood when the owner of the Mirabell, a weathered old German restaurant, was desperately looking to sell.The Italian steakhouse tradition continues.\nPhoto by Jeff MariniSituated a block from the expressway that bisects the city, and at the bottom edge of the sleepy working-class Irving Park neighborhood, Mirabella is in no part of town Sinatra ever hung around. Aucaquizhpi replaced the collection of gaudy ceramic beer steins with wine bottles and drew on his network of first-generation immigrant friends and family who\u2019d paid their dues in many of the same kitchens he had. His brother Ernesto is a server, along with his brother in-law Manuel. His wife, Maria, busses tables on weekends, and his dad, now retired, occasionally lends a hand with the dishes. His manager is 76-year-old Eddy Chiqui, a fellow Ecuadoran who served for 31 years in the front of the house at Sabatino\u2019s\u2014another Chicago Italian-American icon\u2014until it closed last winter.Mirabella opened in the dead of winter two-and-a-half years ago to little fanfare, and the first few months were grim. But after word got out that that a Gene & Georgetti vet was executing a similar menu\u2014at significantly lower prices with none of the crusty attitude\u2014the tables started to fill.Chiqui, who attends the same church as Aucaquizhpi, brings a sense of downtown gravitas (and a loyal following) to the proceedings, greeting guests in the small front barroom in a sharp black tuxedo. Sinatra and Buddy Holly are on the soundtrack, and plates of grilled calamari and chicken Mirabella (the north side analogue to chicken alla Joe) are flying out of the kitchen.Aucaquizhpi is building slow. There\u2019s money for a paint job this spring, and Chiqui is planning to revive the performative tableside baked Alaska and bananas Foster service that transfixed me many evenings at Sabatino\u2019s. As word spread, even some of Aucaquizhpi\u2019s old downtown customers have come through, often dangling the promise of capital infusions to build a new kitchen or hire another cook. But the chef politely turns them down. \u201cI come from the bottom,\u201d he says. \u201cI know how hard it is working when you start at the bottom. Nothing comes free. I\u2019m so happy because I\u2019m not working for nobody.\u201dMike Sula has been a food writer at the Chicago Reader since 2001.
