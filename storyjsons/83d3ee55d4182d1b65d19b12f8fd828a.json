I\u2019m way too short for overpacked concerts, and overwhelming food halls with hungry tourists and long lines make me break out in a cold sweat. But there\u2019s one place that\u2019s got all the makings of these environments, but is so the opposite that, surprise of all surprises, I\u2019d spend my whole day here if I could.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.I\u2019m talking about Bow Market in Somerville, Massachusetts, a new-ish strip mall\u2013ish joint that\u2019s the perfect amount of busy: buzzy, without being jam-packed. It helps that the setup is a two-story ring of 30+ small, separate establishments\u2014each with its own real door!\u2014surrounding a central courtyard where you can take your food to-go. Oh, and the food! There\u2019s bimbimap from Perillas, natural wine from feminist bar Rebel Rebel,  crunchy bar pizza from Hot Box, fluffy pierogies from Jaju, or fancy chocolates made with fresh, local ingredients from G\u00e2t\u00e9 Comme des Filles. There\u2019s literally something for everyone\u2014including even normal food hall haters like me.Go there: Bow MarketExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendBostonRestaurantsRecipes you want to make.
