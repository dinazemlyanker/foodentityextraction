Serve this dressing with her family recipe for Pavochon, the centerpiece of a Puerto Rican Thanksgiving.Ingredients8 Servings8Tbsp. (1 stick) unsalted butter, divided, plus more for pan12cups 1\" cubes cornbread18\u201310-oz. salami, cut into \u00bd\" pieces1large onion, cut into \u00bd\" pieces3celery stalks, cut into \u00bd\" pieces5garlic cloves, choppedKosher salt, freshly ground pepper3Tbsp. finely chopped sage15\u20137-oz. bag stuffing mix croutons3cups low-sodium chicken brothPreparationStep 1Place rack in middle of oven; preheat oven to 350\u00b0. Butter a 13x9\" glass baking dish. Arrange cornbread in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet and bake, tossing halfway through, until golden brown around edges and partially dried out, 25\u201330 minutes. Let cool.Step 2Meanwhile, melt 1 Tbsp. butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook salami, tossing often, until lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer salami to a large bowl.Step 3Add remaining 7 Tbsp. butter to skillet and let melt. Add onion, celery, and garlic, and season with salt and pepper. Cook (still over medium), stirring occasionally, until very soft, 10\u201312 minutes. Add sage and toss to combine.Step 4Add croutons and toasted cornbread to salami and gently toss to combine. Add vegetable mixture and any butter in skillet and gently toss again. Drizzle broth over and let it absorb into bread; season with salt and pepper. Toss gently until just combined (overmixing will cause the cornbread to fall apart); season with more salt and pepper if needed. Dressing should be moist, but there shouldn\u2019t be any liquid pooling in bottom of bowl.Step 5Transfer to prepared baking dish and bake until golden brown on top and bottom, 40\u201345 minutes.How would you rate Cornbread and Salami Dressing?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (4)Back to TopTriangledelicious flavor 'cause... salami. but so dry you have to eat it out in the rain. don't hold to 3C liquid. made this  TG 2020 and can't stress how dry it was. like we just baked a pan of croutons or like there is a typo in the recipe. trying again this year cause we love the salami but i'm trusting my instincts and just riffing on it.sanguinesque2794611/13/2021I made this for Thanksgiving.. was  the BEST!!AnonymousUmatilla, Oregon11/27/2020In case anyone was wondering, two boxes of jiffy cornbread mix makes about the right amount for this recipe. Toss as minimally as possible as mine was quite crumbly. Such a yummy combo.Izzy SiedmanPortland, ME11/25/2020Made it.  Loved it.  Unconventional but soooo good.
