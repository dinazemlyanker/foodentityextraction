It\u2019s entirely made up of pantry staples. The pickling liquid is just a mix of water, salt, sugar, and vinegar\u2014we\u2019ve opted for apple cider, but white wine vinegar, red wine vinegar, sherry vinegar, or rice wine vinegar would all be fine. After letting your quick-pickled red onions sit for at least an hour to soften and marinate, drain them, and then put them to good use brightening up a juicy pile of ribs, sub them into your favorite breakfast sandwich, or scatter them atop a lunchtime grain bowl. They might be simple to make, but these pickled red onions have layers.Editor\u2019s note: This recipe was originally published on May 15, 2012.IngredientsMakes about \u00bd cup Servings\u00bdcups apple cider vinegar1tablespoon sugar1\u00bdteaspoons kosher salt1red onion, thinly slicedPreparationWhisk first 3 ingredients and 1 cup water in a small bowl until sugar and salt dissolve.

I'm not sure why they don't update the recipe, it's been like this for years.C-eatsLouisville, KY1/18/2022Quick & easy. Had only a half red onion so I also sliced a half yellow onion. The combo worked fine; colorful and tasty. Charles Pascual Palm Harbor, FL1/14/2022Quick, perfect, and versatile. We use as a topping that absolutely makes the dish for everything from street tacos to a mixed greens salad w/ strawberries & balsamic vinaigrette.AnonymousColorado12/29/2021Awesome recipe, if water not listed as an ingredient is confusing to you, please let someone else do the cooking lol. JPTEXAS12/26/2021The recipe doesn't say water as ingredient but recipe says add water . Confused Deedeej45Louisiana12/2/2021So good! Set timer for one hour and they were perfect! Made exactly as instructed (including water) One question, do I store IN the liquid, or remove and store separate from the \u201cpickling\u201d liquid?? I want them to last so we can enjoy them!!Ellen McKeeFalmouth, Maine11/30/2021One cup of water is an ingredient.Anonymous11/25/2021Just right for a quick topping.  And as long as you read through the ONE step, you know to add all the ingredients to one cup of water. Lasts about a week in the fridge. Have made it as is, and with subbing about 1/4 of the kosher salt with brining salt (I.e. Prague pink salt) just to see if the flavors change - both goodJen10/30/2021I made this with 4 lb. of skinless boneless breast chicken. I cooked on low for 3.5 hours and followed the recipe except reduced the salt to one tablespoon. It turned out great! The best slow cooking chicken recipe I\u2019ve ever tried. It takes a little longer to put together than other slow cooker recipes due to all the juicing that has to occur, but it is well worth it. You end up wit moist, flavorful chicken; it\u2019s perfect for feeding a crowd, tacos, burritos, salads, etc. AnonymousSan Diego9/18/2021I usually have some of these in the fridge. Often, when I have extra onion after a recipe, I'll just throw it into the brine to avoid waste. A. Nonymous9/5/2021Ok people, it says in the instructions add ingredients to one cup of water. \nThat being said, it\u2019s delicious and basic. One could certainly add to it!JtChicago 9/5/2021WHY WOULD YOU OMIT THE WATER FROM THE INGREDIENTS LIST???Tucker8/3/2021Hey there - put your reading glasses on .. STEP 1 states 1 cup WATER..\nRecipe easy and delicious..Reading RuthieGloucester, MA. 7/22/2021Easy peasy and fabulous!! Great on sandwiches, salads, charcuterie board most anything.
