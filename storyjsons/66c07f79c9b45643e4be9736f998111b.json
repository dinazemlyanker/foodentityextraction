It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.There are a thousand reasons why you\u2019ll never make this recipe, and the main reason is because it\u2019s called Avocado Water.I have no one to blame but myself, but for crying out loud, can we try a little harder with these recipe names? Honestly! Here are some options, right off the top of my head: Whipped Avocado Beverage. It\u2019s Green But Don\u2019t Worry About It Drink. Glass O\u2019 Guacamole. Dairy-Free Lizard Mylk.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Right. Avocado Water. I\u2019ll be perfectly honest with you, the first time I heard about this frothy concoction, I was dubious (at best). But senior food editor Chris Morocco, who got the recipe from NYC chef Daniela Soto-Innes, said it was good, and there is no one more credible, more sound of mind, and more believable than Chris Morocco.Drink up.\nPhoto by Alex LauThese are some of the sensible, avocado-positive things that Chris told me when I scrunched up my face at him and said, \u201cYou expect people to drink that?\u201d First of all, remember that avocado is a fruit. Yes, it\u2019s green, but the prevailing flavor of a just-ripe one is mild and sweet, similar to fresh coconut. Think of it\u2019s high fat content like the starchy flesh of a banana\u2014ultra smooth when blended. And when it comes to said blending...there\u2019s ice to lighten, dilute, and chill; plain old H20 to make it quaffable; fresh lime juice to counter the richness; sugar to make it palatable and refreshing; and salt to make you crave more.It does make sense when you think about it that way, doesn\u2019t it? I know you have a kitchen full of avocados, because you bought extras for the Super Bowl. So why not try something other than a big bowl of guac? Like that tattooed, shirtless Adam Levine guy in the halftime show, maybe it\u2019s time to take a chance on life. Unlike that guy, do something you won\u2019t regret. Show the world you\u2019re unafraid: Go drink an avocado. Just, whatever you do, don\u2019t look at the recipe picture. It\u2019s looks like a sad glass of thickened pea juice sitting in the middle of a hot rock garden. Some recipes just can\u2019t catch a break.Get the recipe:Avocado WaterAvocado gives this refreshing drink the creamy, sippable texture of a milkshake but without a drop of dairy.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterAvocadoRead MorecookingOnly Vitamin C Can Save Us NowBy Carla Lalli MusicRecipes you want to make.
