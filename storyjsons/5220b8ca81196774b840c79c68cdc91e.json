She is a citizen of Ho-Chunk Nation, and while salmon isn\u2019t common in her community, she wanted to highlight the bond between the fish and humans in this recipe because it\u2019s key to so many other tribes\u2019 diets. Before searing the salmon fillet in hot oil, she sprinkles in cumin seeds to add aroma and texture. To finish, she adds a swoosh of smoky, spicy tomatillo salsa, a tribute to her father\u2019s Mexican heritage (\u201cHe eats everything with salsa!\u201d).Ingredients4 ServingsSalsa1lb. tomatillos, husked, rinsed2serrano chiles2garlic cloves, unpeeled\u00bctsp. cumin seedsKosher salt1spring onion or 2 scallions, white and pale green parts only, finely chopped3\u20134sprigs cilantro, tough stems removed, chopped\u00bdtsp. dried oregano, preferably MexicanLime wedges (for serving; optional)Salmon and assembly1Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil\u00bctsp. cumin seeds46-oz. skin-on salmon filletsKosher saltDried oregano, preferably Mexican, cilantro leaves, avocado slices, and lime wedges (for serving)PreparationSalsaStep 1Preheat broiler.
