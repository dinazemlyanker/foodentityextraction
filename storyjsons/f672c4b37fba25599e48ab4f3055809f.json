But for clean slices, let the pie rest before cutting. Spaghetti, bucatini, rigatoni\u2014if it\u2019s pasta, it works for this recipe. Just don\u2019t rinse the noodles; you want that starch. Also, roasting the vegetables first concentrates their flavors and removes excess water.Ingredients8 servings 1medium globe eggplant, peeled, cut into \u00bd\" pieces2pints cherry tomatoes8garlic cloves, smashed\u00bccup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for skillet\u00bdtsp. crushed red pepper flakes, plus more for sprinklingKosher salt2large eggs2Tbsp. tomato paste4oz. finely grated Parmesan, divided1lb. spaghetti2Tbsp. drained capers\u00bdcup torn basil, plus a few whole leavesPreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 425\u00b0.

What do you think is going to happen when you whisk eggs and parmesan cheese into tomato paste and then bake it in pasta? I do use most of the tomato paste from the can, instead of the two tablespoons it calls for. Other than that I make it following the recipe. This is a cast iron skillet recipe! If you are using something else the results will probably not be good. I make it whenever  cherry tomatoes are on sale, although I have used grape tomatoes. I jokingly call it spaghetti pie. Everyone we have served it to has loved it!GregChandler, AZ5/19/2021Not quite as bad as some of the other reviewers make out but I wouldn't make it again.AnonymousMiami, FL9/8/2020I expect more from BA, followed many suggestions in the comments, less pasta, add H20, second bake for 20 mins. Crunchy top and last few bites with extra veg was good, everything else was just dry, bland overcooked pasta. If making double your veg or half your pasta. Too many tasty ingredients wasted for me to have another go at it. Nick KozOmaha7/30/2020Girl. This is really good! I used two medium zucchini instead of the eggplant, put another ounce of cheese in the mixture, and didn\u2019t wait for the cherry tomatoes to completely pop (just close!) and it was PERFECT! 10/10 bb!heystephenedwardPortland, OR5/24/2020I loved this recipe! No, it is not saucy and it should not be! But it is perfect! I made exactly as follows with the exception of not waiting for it to be brown at the end. It is a pasta highlight and the flavors are great! May need to add a smidge more salt to veggies next time as i wasn\u2019t sure in amount. Love the basil, caper flavors! Kept eating more!Columbus ohio4/30/2020Considering the large number of comments regarding dryness, I made a few changes with great results. The keys: day old pasta, the addition of pasta water and another eggplant, and not drying out the eggplants in the oven. Rough directions:\n- Cooked 500g pasta 2 mins short of al dente the day before and saved a cup of pasta water. I wanted to make the final mix more wet so having resistant starch seemed imperative.\n- Peeled and cubed 2 eggplants and cooked them on low heat in a pan along with two chopped onions and salt, about 15 mins. Added sliced garlic and cooked for another min.\n- Took pan off heat, added canned peeled tomatoes (all I had on hand) and roughly smashed them to release juices.\n- Whisked eggs, parmesan, tomato paste, and reserved pasta water.\n- Mixed pasta (straight out of the fridge), eggplant mixture, and egg mixture. Added to a glass baking dish and sprinkled with more parmesan before baking for 40 mins.\n- Would have loved to add capers and basil but didn't have any!Hadi JalaliParis4/25/2020Considering the large number of comments regarding dryness, I made a few changes with great results.

Definitely on my list.Jellins1Houston, TX.4/4/2020Surprisingly good! I baked it in a glass pie plate and came out fine. AnonymousWashington, DC12/1/2019I should've read the other comments before  making this. It was too dry. To save it I did something sacrilegious - I put butter on it :D. \nI might try this again with improvements suggested by others.bonaperitifSeattle, WA9/7/2019I like to review things as I want honesty from others and really do read them.  I did not like this recipe.  I felt it was way too dry and was missing an ingredient. The flavors were pretty good, though.  If I made it again (probably not) I'd have a side of \"gravy\" (marinara) in order to offset the dryness.  Just my humble opinion, but honesty is important when reviewing things.  I try to do that.\nLHemyNew Hampshire, USA8/9/2019I've made this recipe three times now and each time its fantastic the addition of the eggplant is everything hereCollegeCookingDetroit4/24/2019Great recipe.  I read the reviews about reducing pasta and adding sauce, but then proceeded to mostly follow the recipe.  I used the full 1 lb of pasta, ~1 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan/Romano, and an entire 6 ounce can of tomato paste.  It took 45 minutes for my tomatoes to really burst and the eggplant to start getting good color.  I also added a bit of the pasta water to the mix (maybe 1/3 cup) before I put it back in the cast iron.  I thought it came out perfect.  The entire family raved about it.  SB95Dallas2/10/2019So delicious, but with a few changes as many others have mentioned. I did less pasta, added a little tomato sauce with some basic spices, and topped the whole thing off with some mozzarella for the final bake. Will certainly be a regular in my dinner rotation!Anonymous1/9/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titPastaItalian AmericanAmericanItalianEuropeanEggplantVegetableCherry TomatoTomatoBasilHerbs & SpicesSpaghettiPasta & NoodlesBucatiniRigatoniMainVegetarianDinnerRecipes you want to make.
