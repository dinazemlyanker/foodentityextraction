So while we love salmon (we're card-carrying salmon fan club members), our fatty and flavorful standby, sometimes we need a break. That's where these alternatives come in. No, they're not one-to-one subs for salmon, but they are reliable, relatively affordable, and easy-to-find\u2014perfect for when you're in the mood for seafood but need to take a salmon siesta:Mussels and ClamsPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesThese are a weeknight dinner\u2019s best friend. We prefer farm-raised to wild-harvested: They're affordable, super-sustainable, and much easier to clean and prep. Steam them with garlicky butter and dry white wine just until they open\u2014but don\u2019t forget the baguette. (For all the details, look here.)ShrimpPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesYou\u2019ll never regret keeping a bag of shrimp in the freezer for tacos, curries, pastas, and stir-fries. They defrost quickly and cook in a flash: Take them off the heat as soon as they\u2019re bright pink.White FishPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesFillets of firm-fleshed white fish like pollack, hake, halibut, and cod are mild, meaty, and forgiving\u2014and they can be cooked in much the same way as salmon (seared, slow-roasted, poached). You\u2019ll know it\u2019s cooked when the flesh is opaque and flakes easily. Just because you can cook white fish like salmon, however, doesn't mean it makes a perfect substitute: Here's how to navigate seafood swaps seamlessly.SquidPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesIf you like fried calamari, you\u2019ll love a simple pasta pomodoro with a handful of sliced squid (thawed if frozen) thrown in at the end. Pre-cleaned squid cooks in no time at all and is one of the cheapest and most ocean-friendly options out there.Not salmon, still delicious:Family-Style Fish TacosNo grill, no deep-fryer, no problemo. Our summery tacos rely on our go-to fish-cooking method\u2014slow-roast, baby\u2014for all the flavor without the fuss.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titSeafoodFishRecipes you want to make.
