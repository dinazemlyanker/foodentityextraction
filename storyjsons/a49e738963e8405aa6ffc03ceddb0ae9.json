Yes, they\u2019re room temp. And yes, they\u2019ll be the first thing to disappear from the table.By Sarah JampelNovember 15, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiFacebookTwitterEmailWhat if we told you that this year, the salad\u2019s going to be the talk of the Thanksgiving table? That guests are going to ask you what\u2019s in that dressing rather than what\u2019s in the dry rub? That your relatives will strategically position themselves for proximity to the salad bowl rather than the carving board?It\u2019s a hard sell, salad on Thanksgiving. What, with mashed potatoes and roasted potatoes and sweet potatoes (and then there\u2019s turkey and, hopefully, a spread of desserts), it can be hard to justify making room for raw fiber. And the very sensible arguments that might convince you to eat salad on any other day\u2014it balances your plate; it slows down your eating (lots of crunching and munching) so that you can pace yourself; it\u2019s a good source of vitamins and minerals, yadda yadda\u2014don\u2019t hold much weight on the Year\u2019s Biggest Eating Holiday. You can eat salad tomorrow!But before you write salad off for yet another starchy side, ask yourself: Wouldn\u2019t you welcome a break from the monotony of rich, creamy, meaty food if it came in the form of delicious salad that felt just as festive, special, and\u2014hate to use this word but...\u2014indulgent as the rest of the menu? (And, don\u2019t you think there\u2019s some truth to the notion that eating salad now actually opens up more room for sweets later?)Photo by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiSenior food editor Chris Morocco dreamt up three new Thanksgiving salad recipes that don\u2019t feel like ho-hum vegetable placeholders. \u201cPutting coleslaw on the table would fulfill the mission of a raw vegetable side, but not in a way that\u2019s in keeping with Thanksgiving.\u201d So he set out to do what any vegetable-loving recipe developer would: Create salads as beautiful as they are desirable. Here\u2019s how can you do the same.Seek knockout ingredients: Now\u2019s the time to drag yourself to the farmers market or the speciality food store and seek out the colorful, unusually shaped ingredients that don\u2019t make it on the table on any old day. Produce like purple carrots, pink-speckled Castelfranco radicchio (the darling bitter green of some of the country\u2019s coolest restaurants), and wispy Napa cabbage are stunning all by themselves (read: they won\u2019t require much compensating). \u201cWhen you change the players, says Chris, \u201cyou change the game.\u201dTake what\u2019s usually cooked, and serve it raw: Think about a vegetable you\u2019re used to seeing cooked to death (broccoli, carrots, beets) and present it raw for an addition to the table that\u2019s surprising\u2014and not to mention pleasantly crisp and refreshing in comparison to the velvety softness elsewhere. Chris lets the carrot coins and broccoli pieces sit in the dressing to ease up, so you won\u2019t feel like a bunny rabbit when the time comes to eat.You don\u2019t have to stick with leafy greens. When you swap out the massaged kale or baby spinach for something less voluminous, like thinly sliced carrots or cabbage, you\u2019ll be able to feed more people without having to devote your entire fridge to bags of lettuce (since you\u2019ve got a turkey dry-brining in there, don\u2019t you?).Aim for a complete set of flavors in every dish: When you make a salad with salty and acidic components plus a touch of sweetness (like the charred, jammy dates in the carrot salad), heat (from crushed red pepper flakes or pickled chiles), and fragrant herbs, there\u2019s no need to make more than one.And don\u2019t forget lots of citrus. Whether it\u2019s lemon, lime, grapefruit, or blood orange, that acid will cut through the richness of the rest of the table.Thanksgiving salad\u2019s sounding real good right about now, isn\u2019t it?Get the recipes:Shaved Carrots with Charred DatesTangy, crunchy carrots meet soft and sweet blackened dates for literally everything you want in one bite.View RecipeRadicchio Salad with Sour Cream RanchWith salty, sweet, and creamy components, this recipe is more than just a salad: It's a fully realized side dish.View RecipeBroccoli CaesarYou've never met a better, brighter riff on the classic Caesar than this raw broccoli twist.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titThanksgivingSaladWinterRead MorecookingThe Glazed Brussels Sprouts You\u2019ll Be Making All FallBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
