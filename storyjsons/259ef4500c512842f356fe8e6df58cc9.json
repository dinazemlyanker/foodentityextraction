Haha, but really. Because the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market, with its well-curated food stands and verdant, abundant produce, will make you wish you had a farmers market just as good this one in your city.BUY: whatever is in season, from juicy cherry tomatoes in the summer to pristine citrus in the winter. Word to the wise: Before you buy anything, take a walk inside and outside the Ferry Building and get a good look at everything on display. That way you\u2019ll get a lay of the land before shelling out all your singles. However, you should always buy a container of Aedan country miso\u2014nothing else comes close to its nutty, barley-laden miso.THE VIBE IS: leisurely. In the mornings, you\u2019ll find chefs doing their shopping and tourists by the afternoon. But it never feels crazy busy, thanks to the sprawling layout.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Tuesday and Thursday 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and Saturday 8 a,.m. to 2 p.m.\u2014Elyse InamineAmanda LynnAmanda LynnWE ALSO LOVETartine ManufactoryThe megabakery-slash-wine-bar-slash-ice-cream-shop-slash-restaurantLord StanleySeasonal, cheffy cooking has never looked fresherMister Jiu'sFarm-to-Chinatown-table\u00a0in San FranciscoExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
