This is your new (totally achievable! Totally impressive!) holiday baking mini-project.By Carey PolisDecember 11, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Susan Spungen, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiFacebookTwitterEmailIt was very brave of Bonappetit.com senior editor Sasha Levine to assign me this article. Sure, I\u2019ve made decent cookies and brownies many times before. But any dessert item that involves making two doughs, measuring the size of the dough based on 6x2\u201d rectangles, and creating layers of said dough is a world beyond my pastry comprehension.Sasha, for unknown reasons, had blind faith that I could handle it. And ya know what, friends? I did okay! Better than okay even! A sugar-happy four-year-old and several colleagues confirmed that my cookies tasted great\u2014like shortbread meets a not-too-sweet chocolate Oreo, minus the cream filling. Plus, they looked mostly like the professionally styled photo, minus some uneven blue sprinkles and a chocolate layer that didn\u2019t make it all the way to the edges. I found myself eating \u201cseveral\u201d at a time.If I, a person who has stains on her shirt more often than not, can make these cookies, then I feel very confident that you can too. So bust out that pastry ruler and keep these things in mind:1. Don\u2019t be intimidated by the swirl.It\u2019s right there in the recipe headnote: \u201cHere\u2019s a fancy-looking swirl that novices can succeed at too.\u201d This is a forgiving swirl. Let\u2019s say, hypothetically, that you make your two doughs and discover that somehow you have a bit more vanilla dough than chocolate dough...and the vanilla dough is a little more pliable. Soldier on, comrade! As long as you can still stack the doughs per the recipe instructions (see more below), it\u2019s all going to be fine. If you\u2019re a perfectionist, I\u2019m sure your cookies will look amazing. If you\u2019re the kind of person who consistently discovers food in your hair many hours since you last ate (hi! Let\u2019s be friends!), these cookies can still be part of your repertoire.2. You can make the dough three days ahead of time.Cookie projects are fun, but then life gets in the way\u2014grocery shopping took longer than you thought, you have been meaning to go to the gym, that cheesy Netflix Christmas movie is beckoning you\u2026 It\u2019s all good. Make the dough, put it in the fridge, and bake the cookies another day. These are cookies for sort of lazy\u2014but not entirely lazy\u2014people.3. These cookies can help you get out some rage.The step I was dreading the most was when you have to stack the vanilla and chocolate layers on top of each other to join them into one black-and-white log. My doughs were, um, not exactly the same texture (as previously confessed) and I was worried about that final swirl. In the end, though, this ended up being my favorite part. The instructions say to \u201cpat into rectangles\u201d but I interpreted \u201cpat\u201d as \u201caggressively mold the layers while working through some \u201cfeelings.\u201d It was cathartic. May the layering offer you the same respite it did for me.Get the recipe:Zebra-Striped Shortbread CookiesHere's a fancy-looking chocolate-vanilla swirl that novices can succeed at too.View RecipeYou know what would make a pretty great holiday gift?
