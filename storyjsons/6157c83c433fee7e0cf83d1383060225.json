All of Tokyo\u2019s best bars are little worlds unto themselves, and Bloody Angle is one ruled by dreams of Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-wai. The entire space is hard surfaces and straight lines, softened by red light and vintage American records. You\u2019re in the throbbing heart of the Japanese capital and immersed in a vintage work of Hong Kong romanticism all at once. So light your cigarette, sip your drink, and drift in slow-motion through your own nocturnal fantasy.ORDER THE: drink you love the most, be it an old-fashioned or a gin and tonic. This isn\u2019t a bar that tries to reinvent the wheel with wild new iterations of cocktails. Like the music it plays, the drinks are the classics that you already know and love. But they\u2019re made with the characteristic precision and craft that is the hallmark of the Japanese bar.THE VIBE IS: the low-key, slowed-down after-party. This isn\u2019t the place where your night starts, and it might not be where it ends. But it is somewhere where you find yourself among the hip and the beautiful, taking a breather between dinner and extracurricular carousing.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Monday to Saturday from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. Closed on Sundays. The menu is English and Japanese. Some English is spoken by the staff. The nearest subway stop is Shibuya.By Kee Byung-keunExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
