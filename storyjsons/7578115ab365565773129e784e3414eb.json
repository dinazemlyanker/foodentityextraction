The spatchcock does a few things: It flattens the bird so the breasts and legs cook evenly and cuts down on cooking time. And unlike a wet brine, a dry rub\u2014this one\u2019s got five-spice, MSG, and light brown sugar\u2014gets into every nook and cranny of the whole bird without making a big mess. (You can skip the MSG if you prefer, but it will add just the right amount of umami backbone to the rub, so we recommend it.) \u2014Jessie YuChenAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Open up chicken and turn breast side up. Press down on center of breast to flatten chicken\u2014you should hear the breastbone crack. Tuck wings behind breast, then tuck in legs so bottoms of drumsticks are pointed away from body and chicken is as flat as possible. Sprinkle spice mixture all over chicken. Let sit at room temperature 20 minutes, or cover and chill up to 1 day. If chilling, let sit at room temperature 1 hour before grilling.Step 3Prepare a grill for medium-high indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off). Lightly oil grate. Grill chicken, breast side up, over indirect heat, undisturbed, until browned and lightly charred underneath, about 20 minutes.Step 4Turn chicken breast side down and move over direct heat. Grill, turning often and returning to indirect heat as needed, until well-browned, cooked through, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh registers 165\u00b0 and into thickest part of breast registers 160\u00b0, 15\u201320 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes.Step 5Brush scallions with remaining 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil and grill, turning occasionally, until charred in spots, 6\u20138 minutes.

Followed Mag\u2019s oven version below and roasted baby potatoes in the skillet with the chicken. Paired it with roasted Leeks (instead we of scallions) and asparagus and doused with the vinegar sauce!\n\nAdding this one to the rotation! B&DDC,USA1/27/2022This is a fantastic recipe that I will return to time and time again.  The flavors were perfectly balanced (please, please don\u2019t skip on the MSG), and the sauce was a perfect compliment. We served our chicken with steamed jasmine rice and Chinese broccoli. \n\nHowever, right as we were about to grill, there was torrential downpour, so we had to pivot. I ended up roasting it in a cast iron skillet in the oven. 500-degrees for the first 25min, and lowered the oven to 450-degrees for the remaining 20min to slow the browning a bit. \n\nCan\u2019t wait to try this on the grill, but the roasted chicken was incredible. Mag LundholmChicago, IL9/3/2021This was delish and will make again. A welcome change to my standard roast chicken. I followed the recipe exactly and used my new Traeger grill it came out just perfect with crispy skin and juicy flavorful meat, the sauce puts it over the top. I served with a kale salad & roast shiitake mushrooms, grated carrots and a peanut butter dressing as well as blistered green beans with garlic & ginger. The meal was a hit. Thanks Bon Appetit !Chef RachelleNYC 8/4/2021This chicken is so fragrant while cooking and filled with flavor to eat! I have been wanting to try spatchcocking chicken for a while and this recipe just sounded appealing. It was not difficult to prep the chicken and it came out so moist and delicious! I could not find the five spice in my area (rural NC) so I made my own by grinding the spices together. It was such a hit with my family and neighbors that we will be using this recipe for a neighborhood get together!
