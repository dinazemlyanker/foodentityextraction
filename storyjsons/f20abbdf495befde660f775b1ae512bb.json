This time around: knives.A familiar scenario: You\u2019re about to make an obscenely large amount of Broccoli Cheddar Soup With Cheesy Croutons, because the world is strange and you need a hug on the inside. So you whip out your trusty chef\u2019s knife to make light work of those florets\u2014only your knife is blunter than 2020. What\u2019s a soup-seeker to do?Your knife needs to be sharpened, and for the sake of convenience\u2014soup waits for no one!\u2014you might want to break out a honing rod. To be clear, honing is not the same thing as sharpening (more on that in a bit), but honing a dull knife is better than nothing and will get you back to the broc faster than you can say whetstone. Don\u2019t let perfectly sharp get in the way of sharp enough! Don\u2019t hack when you can hone!\u00a0Here\u2019s what you need to about honing rods\u2014what they are, when to use them, and which one to buy:What in heck is a honing rod anyway?It\u2019s a kitchen tool that looks a bit like a less-menacing sword. Mounted on the handle is a rounded stick-like rod\u2014typically made from steel, ceramic, or diamond-coated steel. They\u2019re commonly used to straighten the edge of a knife as it's gently dragged along the rod from heel to tip in a downward slicing motion. Swish, swish, swish!ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.How does honing work?If you were to look at your knife blade under a very strong microscope, you\u2019d notice the edge looks like a series of tiny teeth ( \ud83d\ude2c)\u2014which get knocked down and bent out of shape with regular use. Using a honing rod can realign that toothy edge, says test kitchen director Chris Morocco, which helps keep your knife feeling sharp, even as 232 Bleecker chef Suzanne Cupps reminds us, it \u201cdoesn\u2019t take the place of sharpening it.\u201dSo what\u2019s the difference between honing and sharpening?Sharpening your knife with the likes of a whetstone uses friction to remove some of the steel and create a new, sharper edge. A honing rod, on the other hand, maintains that sharpness\u2014it offers a quick fix by realigning the existing edge.\u00a0You can think of it like cutting your fingernails versus filing them. \u201cCutting (sharpening) reestablishes a new edge,\u201d explains Hannah Cheng, one of the sisters behind Mimi Cheng\u2019s in New York. \u201cWhereas filing (honing) smooths out that edge.\u201d In other words, if your knife edge is pretty sharp, honing can help keep it that way.When should I hone my knives?You\u2019ll want to bust out the honing rod when you notice your knife isn\u2019t slicing as smoothly, but you don\u2019t have time to sharpen it. If you\u2019re finding it hard to slice a soft-skinned piece of produce, like a tomato or plum, \u201cthen your knife will need honing,\u201d says Joshua Lucio-Lasso, chef at Public Records and self-described \u201csharp freak\u201d who hones his knives every day. If, after you\u2019ve honed, it\u2019s still tough to get through the tomato skin afterward, it\u2019s time to sharpen!Because Cheng cooks a lot, her rule of thumb is simple: She sharpens her knives weekly and then hones them before each use.What kind of honing rod should I buy?The wand chooses the wizard, Harry. While you can hone most chef\u2019s knives, \u201cnot every rod works with every steel,\u201d Morocco says, adding that your honing rod must be harder than the knife steel to have an effect. For example, German-style knives are softer and can work with any rod, but Japanese blades are super hard and need the big guns: ceramic.Cupps and Morocco both recommend an all-rounder, like this MAC ceramic honing rod. It\u2019s harder than steel and has a finer grit, which works faster and is less rough on your knife edge. (Remember the nail file analogy? Same idea.) Use it gently, especially on Japanese knives\u2014remember: There\u2019s no need to apply pressure. And whenever honing is ineffective, it\u2019s time to break out the whetstone, okay?Photo by Laura MurrayMAC Ceramic Knife Sharpener$23 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titKnifeKnivesToolsBasicallyRead MorecookingYou Don't Need a Knife SetBy Sarah Jampel and Alex DelanycookingHow to Shop For a Knife Like You Know What You're DoingBy Sarah JampelshoppingThe Best Knife Storage Solutions for Keeping Your Blades Sharper, LongerBy Carrie Honaker and Tiffany HopkinsRecipes you want to make.
