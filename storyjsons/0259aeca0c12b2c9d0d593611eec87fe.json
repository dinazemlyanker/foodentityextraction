I don't care for traditional coleslaw, but this one is delicious.  It's much lighter are more flavorful.AnonymousPortland, ME1/26/2022Great recipe, this slaw became an immediate staple at home. I have used other vinegars as well, but rice vinegar is the best for this. AnonymousSan Francisco, CA6/28/2021I make this all the time, minus the onions. The salting and squeeze out of the excess water makes the slow crunchy rather than slimy.  I've also substituted sesame oil for the olive oil for extra kick.SandyRiverside, CA6/20/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titSlawSaladRed OnionOnionVegetableRed CabbageCabbageLeafy GreensSummerQuickEasyWeeknight MealsSideDairy-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreeRawVeganVegetarianHealthyishLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
