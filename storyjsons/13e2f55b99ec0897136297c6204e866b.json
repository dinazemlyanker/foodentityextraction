Can I Just Use Water?Chances I have water > chances I have vegetable broth.By Rebecca GaoNovember 10, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensFacebookTwitterEmailIf you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ve been knee-deep in a recipe only to realize you\u2019re fresh out of vegetable stock. As you panic about ruining your batch of Hetty McKinnon\u2019s one-pot mac and cheese, one small thought enters your mind: Can I just use water?The simple answer is yes, it\u2019s usually okay to substitute vegetable stock with water. In most recipes that call for vegetable stock, its main advantage over water is that it provides flavor, which is especially important if you're making vegetarian or vegan food that\u2019s missing the richness from meat. \u201cWhen you're missing the animal protein, you still want an umami factor,\u201d BA senior food editor Andy Baraghani says.According to McKinnon, whose most recent cookbook is To Asia, With Love, you can confidently substitute veg stock with water when you\u2019re cooking with meat because so much of a dish's flavor comes from the meat itself. \u201cBut if you're cooking vegetarian food, I always think you need to build layers of flavors, and stock is just one of those layers.\u201dUnless you get low-sodium stock, most store-bought stocks are fairly salty, so one of the main elements you miss out on when replacing it with water is sodium content. If you are going to sub water for stock, McKinnon suggests adding salt and herbs (like thyme, bay leaves, and rosemary) to your water to compensate for the lost flavor. Her mac and cheese recipe, for example, calls for vegetable stock, but it\u2019s totally okay to sub with water because the dish is loaded with herbs and aromatics. When a dish already has a lot going on, like a mixture of onions, garlic, ginger, and chiles cooked long and hard, agrees Baraghani, water can easily replace stock.If you don\u2019t keep stock on hand but you don\u2019t want to lose out on flavor, McKinnon suggests dissolving bouillon cubes in water. Bouillon powder (which, like cubes, is made of dehydrated veggies and seasoning) is another easy way to add flavor to your vegetarian cooking. Plus, it\u2019s versatile, can be used to season almost any dish that needs a little bit of a flavor kick, and is a great pantry staple\u2014especially in these one-grocery-run-a-week times. McKinnon swears by Vegeta, which her mom used. \u201cIn many cases, [my mom] will add the powder straight into the pot,\u201d she says. Jarred bouillon, like Better Than Bouillon, is another option.Of course, there\u2019s also absolutely nothing wrong with buying cartons of vegetable stock. But, unless you have a brand you\u2019re familiar with, you often don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting, and they sometimes taste sweeter than the homemade stuff or bouillon. Making your own stock gives you full control, and it\u2019s a great way to use up the veggie scraps (carrot tops, potato peels, and onion skins) you\u2019ve been storing in the freezer. You might need to experiment a bit until you get a stock you like\u2014start with one of stock recipes. \u201cI find adding kombu, which is essential to making dashi, is the way to kind of get that salty umami flavor,\u201d says Baraghani.Though there aren\u2019t hard and fast rules when it comes to stock, there are a couple scenarios where substitution isn\u2019t a good idea. Whenever the flavor is coming primarily from stock, you shouldn\u2019t substitute it with water. In that case, you\u2019ll also want to make sure the stock you\u2019re using tastes good to you. Any brothy non-pur\u00e9ed soups should be made with your favorite vegetable stock if that\u2019s what the recipe calls for\u2014the stock is what you\u2019ll mostly be tasting. The same can be said for starches like risotto or polenta, which soak up flavor from the liquid as they cook.So make your own stock, try store-bought cartons, cubes, powders, or jars until you find what you like best, or experiment with replacing your stock with seasoned water. But whatever you do, don\u2019t let a lack of stock stop you from making this mac and cheese.Get the recipe:One-Pot Kimchi and Squash Mac and CheeseThis is a \u201cnecessity is the mother of invention\u201d kind of recipe, born from isolation, scant ingredients, an oversupply of kimchi, and sheer hunger. Yet this unconventional one-pot approach also happens to be one of the simplest ways to prepare mac and cheese.\u00a0View RecipeRebecca Gao is a Toronto-based journalist interested in climate, food and late-aughts teen movies.
