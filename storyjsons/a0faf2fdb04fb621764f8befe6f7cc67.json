Quick-cooking\u2014and quick to dry out on the grates\u2014chicken breast is notorious for turning tough and stringy if you\u2019re not careful. The good news: A couple of simple preventative measures taken along your grilled chicken journey can ensure juicy, succulent white meat every time. Follow our lead and pretty soon a humble chicken breast dish\u2014like, say, this Grilled Chicken Breast with Tadka-ish Sauce\u2014 will be the star of your next summer cookout. Here\u2019s what you need to know.Choose your cut wiselyWhile fattier chicken thighs can handle going skinless, when it comes to grilling chicken breasts, it\u2019s skin-on, bone-in all the way. Not only is crispy, rendered skin delicious, it protects lean, delicate meat from drying out\u2014especially in an open-fire cooking situation. And the bone underneath insulates the meat from the flames, allowing for more even distribution of heat. If you have access to a butcher, ask for skin-on, bone-in breasts, and if you\u2019re looking at a supermarket selection, skin-on boneless is the next-best compromise, and most likely easier to track down.Watch the temperatureYou\u2019ll want to account for carryover cooking, which is when food continues to cook even after it\u2019s been removed from the heat source. While 165\u00b0 is the internal temperature you want for chicken, remember that it\u2019ll continue to cook as it\u2019s resting\u2014which means if you\u2019re getting that reading while the meat is still on the grill it\u2019s actually overcooked. Use an instant-read thermometer and pull your chicken off the grill at around 160\u00b0, then temp it again after it\u2019s rested for a couple minutes and you\u2019ll see the internal temperature climb to a safe 165\u00b0, saving yourself from tough, overcooked chicken.Speaking of resting...Don\u2019t skip this step. Slicing into your chicken right off the grill means you\u2019re likely to end up with most of the juices pooling on your cutting board. It can be tempting to dive in immediately, but waiting just five to 10 minutes to allow the juices to reabsorb into the meat makes an enormous difference. And when it comes time to serve, be sure to slice against the grain, which helps prevent stringiness.Sauces are your friendIf all else fails, a saucy dressing is a foolproof, speedy way to quickly add juiciness to your chicken after it\u2019s finished cooking. Whether it\u2019s a tadka-ish sauce with nigella seeds, zingy ginger-scallion-lemongrass sauce, funky-sweet fish sauce caramel, or a simple, tangy, garlicky Italian dressing, sauces and toppings will add layers of flavor and moisture to a cut of meat that is otherwise something of a blank canvas. If you cook your chicken breasts perfectly, these embellishments will make them truly memorable. If you don\u2019t, well, a good sauce erases all sins.Explore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
