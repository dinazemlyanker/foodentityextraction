But also, bring some home, because we\u2019re making ni\u00e7oise toast with it.By Molly BazMay 22, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie Craig, food styling by Anna BillingskogFacebookTwitterEmailI first caught sight of the primary-colored can of Ortiz Bonito del Norte in a small grocery in Menorca, Spain. I was there with my husband, and we were stocking up on supplies before heading out for a day at the beach. But a day at the beach in Menorca meant we\u2019d endure a long and rocky trek along the seaside cliffs until we found the perfect crystal-clear cove. The kind of place where you wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a mermaid swimming around; these beaches were that majestic.But enough with my fairytale. The point is, we needed to pack a picnic. And I needed that picnic to be epic. Which in my book almost always means some combination of the following: a can or two of high quality tuna, a jar of olives, some pickle-y snack\u2014cornichons or pickled peppers\u2014and a head of little gem lettuce. This equips me with all of the essential elements to create a beachside lettuce wrap.  If ham and cheese sandwiches at the beach have always been your thing, give this picnic lineup a try. It has never failed me.I learned that day that Bonito Del Norte is NOT your average tin of Starkist. The two have nothing in common besides their containers. Ortiz oil-packed white tuna is beautifully poached and perfectly seasoned, never too salty. The fish gently flakes apart revealing lovely blush pink flesh\u2014not that overcooked gray mushy stuff you might be used to hiding in mayonnaise. It comes submerged in buttery yellow olive oil\u2014good enough to be drizzled onto your next ni\u00e7oise salad. Tuna of this caliber doesn\u2019t yearn to be swathed in mayonnaise and studded with celery. It shines most when simply dressed with a few drops of lemon juice and a pinch of flaky sea salt, which makes it perfectly suited for the low maintenance beach picnic. It is a high reward product that is truly worth the splurge.This is also the tuna I used for this new ni\u00e7oise toast recipe, aka TOTES toast.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, food styling by Molly Baz, prop styling by Emily EisenA few tuna and olive stuffed lettuce cups later I was hooked. Now back stateside, I am thrilled to see this product available in my local Whole Foods, at higher end markets, and even on Amazon. I\u2019m telling you this is the good stuff, and it\u2019s not just because I first tasted it on a white sand beach swirling with mermaids.Buy it: Ortiz Bonito Del Norte, White Tuna in Olive Oil, $30 for a pack of 4 on AmazonGet the recipe:Ni\u00e7oise ToastFried bread, with buttery oil-packed tuna on top.
