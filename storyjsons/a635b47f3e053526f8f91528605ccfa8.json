An instant thanksgiving classic.  Next time I will serve the hot honey butter on the side so people can add the amount that they would like upon serving.JordanNewark, CA12/1/2020I served this to 150 people for a community lunch takeaway program last week.  Elegant and VERY well received.  Entr\u00e9e was honey baked ham with prickly pear/plum glaze and corn pudding side dish.Jimmie VaughnPittsboro, NC11/13/2020I love me some honey butter with hush puppies but...  I found this recipe to be greasy. I prefer clean, crisp flavors. The butter made the sweet potatoes mushy and soggy. If you have a crowd that doesn't like vegetables - go for it, it will be a hit. Los Angeles, CA 6/8/2020To get the hot honey butter consistent I melted the butter, stirred in the honey and hot sauce, and chilled it to firm up a bit. Dunno what the final texture is like with softened butter but with melted it maintained a very spreadable liquidy-but-not-too-thin texture.Anonymous5/29/2020Everyone enjoyed; my mom loved it and wants it a ton at the thanksgiving table! Only changes I made were using japanese sweet potatoes because that\u2019s all I could get, and probably using only 6TB of olive oil in total.AnonymousKentucky 5/28/2020Made this for my family today and they loved it! Will definitely be making this again.hannah.pnnggAustria5/16/2020Love this! Had to make a lot of substitutes. Only had mixed bits so used those. Only had vegan butter, no butter at the store. No coriander. Only had Valentina instead of Cholula. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af  was still delicious! Added some raw red onion and extra honey and hot sauce on top for kick.\nWas still supbrookeatillman@gmail.comAtlanta, GA4/11/2020Wow! Made for second Sedar.  Excellent...will definitely make again.mikermealsChicago, Illinois4/10/2020We thought these were delicious, easy and very filling! I loved making the hot honey butter and pine nuts (subbed for pumpkin seeds, will have to try next time) while the potatoes were going. This is great for big groups, possibly Thanksgiving. tarahegermillerGeorgetown, TX (near Austin)4/7/2020These were super good, but took a ton of work. It wasn't a difficult recipe, but (in my small kitchen) it felt like a ton of steps. I haven't wanted to make them again given that I wasn't sure the pay off was worth the mess and time. Anonymous4/6/2020Absolutely incredible. We didn\u2019t have pepitas on hand so we ended up substituting for sunflower seeds and they definitely filled the texture void had we just left the seeds out (the crunch really makes it, so definitely do not recommend making this sans seeds). Will FOR SURE be making again, this is going to be a knockout at our next Thanksgiving or Christmas! kaylayestalToronto2/29/2020These are magical! It's amazing how these ingredients come together and make such delicious potatoes. Definitely will make this regularly. AnonymousLouisville, KY1/22/2020Delicious, easy and so impressive! These were the standout side dish at a dinner party we hosted recently, coming in a very close second to our beef tenderloin. These are an amazing combination of flavors and textures! I prepared the recipe just as written and everyone agreed it's a keeper.AnonymousCincinnati, OH12/30/2019I made this for Thanksgiving and LOVED it.  I used Trader Joes pumpkin spiced pepitas instead of making the ones here, but other than that I made it just as written.  The hot honey butter was delicious and came together just fine for me.  Like another reviewer said, the combination of textures and tastes are what make this recipe.  I'll definitely make this one again.  My only concern was I didn't understand having the potatoes cooled.  I ended up heating them up again a little and serving with the hot honey butter slowly melting over the top.
