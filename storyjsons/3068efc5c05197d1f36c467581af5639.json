Access to fresh fish from the Pacific Ocean, meat, produce and wines that are nurtured by British Columbia\u2019s fertile microclimates, plus a thriving beef industry in Alberta, all give this part of the country its culinary edge. And as the largest city in British Columbia, Vancouver is privy to all of it.So it\u2019s no surprise that Jefferson Alvarez, who was most recently chef at a local pan-Latin American restaurant, Cacao, chose the city as his home. Originally from Venezuela, Alvarez studied at Le Cordon Bleu Ottawa Culinary Arts Institute and worked in kitchens all over the world before settling in Vancouver nine years ago. \u201cVancouver is a young city with a lot of potential,\u201d he says. The booming metropolis is home to beaches, mountains, rainforests, and nearby islands, but best of all, it\u2019s a melting pot of cultures and cuisines. \u201cI\u2019m always looking for the restaurants that are doing something new and unique,\u201d he says.But Alvarez is just one of the many noteworthy chefs who\u2019ve flocked to the city in recent years. Today he has a community of chefs and cuisines he\u2019s proud to support. From Jo\u00ebl Watanabe\u2019s innovative hybrid of Japanese and Italian cuisine at the impeccably decorated Kissa Tanto, to Masayoshi Baba\u2019s pristine and precise Japanese omakase (which roughly translates to \u201cI\u2019ll leave it up to you\u201d) creations, Vancouver\u2019s food scene is not to be missed when in British Columbia. Here, Alvarez takes us to some of his favorite restaurants in the city for a look at Vancouver\u2019s exceptional and diverse food scene.Photo by Grant Harder | Slow-cooked organic chuck flat, chickpea tofu, cipollini, enoki, salted napa cabbage in a sukiyaki broth at Kissa TantoKISSA TANTOIn the heart of Chinatown, one block away from chef Jo\u00ebl Watanabe\u2019s other restaurant, Bao Bei Chinese Brasserie, is the cross-cultural wonderland known as Kissa Tanto. Inside reveals pink leather booths and barstools, brass accents, dark wood, and lush, jewel-toned velvet curtains. While the decor is enough to marvel at, the fusion of Japanese Italian cuisine is what keeps this popular, award-winning spot booked up nearly every night.\u201cWe needed a defined food concept to help with the design process,\u201d adds Watanabe. \u201cI picked two cuisines that are similar in many ways, but also offer immense breadth so that we may spend many years exploring.\u201dPhoto by Grant Harder | Chef Jefferson Alvarez and chef Jo\u00ebl Watanabe at Kissa TantoMenu items typical of the style of cuisine are dishes like the gnocco fritto with olive oil crackers, kombu dashi, braised onion, ricotta salata and greens, or the spaghettini served with white ragu of thyme pork sausage, soy pickled garlic, almond parsley pesto, and a ginger crumb. But Watanabe says the whole fried fish, served with daikon-soy dipping sauce, is something people specifically come back for. \u201cThey\u2019ll request it with their reservation, as we only have limited amounts every night.\u201dPhoto by Grant Harder | Clams in vermut, jamon serrano gran reserva 24 months, stuffed olives and gildas, tortilla con jamon, malaca G&T, galician octopus at C\u00f3mo TaperiaC\u00d3MO TAPERIAOver in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood, don\u2019t be alarmed if you hear the cries and cheers of soccer fans ringing from inside C\u00f3mo Taperia. \u201cWe wanted to capture the madness of a Barcelona- or Madrid-style tapas bar,\u201d says partner Shaun Layton. \u201cButting elbows while standing at the bar watching bartenders pour vermouth and cava while plating tapas and dealing with a crowd of people. It\u2019s kind of like dining in the middle of a hurricane, but in a good way.\u201dThis casual bar with a soccer motif and a killer gin-and-tonic list is the first of its kind in Vancouver. Chef Justin Witcher sources as much produce, meat, and fish from local suppliers as  possible, but admits that some things are better from Spain, like olive oils, jamon, olives, conservas, and even octopus. \u201cWe\u2019d be foolish to try and get the same result and flavor with a lower-end product.\u201dTry the croquetas de jamon: a thick b\u00e9chamel sauce is made from jam\u00f3n, milk, and a bay leaf, then cooled, crumbed in panko, and deep fried to a golden brown. Other standouts are clams in vermouth, and chicken livers saut\u00e9ed and deglazed with sherry butter. As for drinks, vermouth and sherry are on tap, while a rotating list of gin and tonics\u2013\u2013with at least eight different tonic options\u2013\u2013keeps the party going. Layton adds, \u201cWhen people come to join us, they are leaving their comfort zones and embracing Spain.\u201dPhoto by Grant Harder | Chef Masayoshi Baba preparing sushi at MasayoshiMASAYOSHITo visit Masayoshi in the Fraserhood area, you\u2019ll be taken about 15 minutes out of Vancouver\u2019s downtown core to a tidy restaurant that is roughly 400 square feet and home to just six tables and bar seating. But for a night of omakase with chef Masayoshi Baba, a detour is well worth it. \u201cHe is a legend here,\u201d says Alvarez. \u201cThere is so much integrity and love for the work he does. It\u2019s incredibly hard to find a place like this.\u201dBaba doesn\u2019t speak much English, but his food speaks for him. His omakase-only menu uses seasonal ingredients, is artfully plated, and specially prepared by Baba himself. Each morning, he procures only enough ingredients for that day. He makes his own soy sauce and freshly prepares his own wasabi. \u201cHe gets all his equipment from Japan,\u201d Alvarez says, \u201cright down to the bamboo tray where he keeps fish so it is not exposed to cold air.\u201dBecoming a sushi chef is to undertake a career built on foundations of precision, patience, and passion. At Masayoshi, making sushi is an art form. To sit at the bar and watch Baba thoughtfully slice fish and assemble each dish is to take part in a kind of exhibit. \u201cIt\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime experience,\u201d Alvarez says.Photo by Grant Harder | Bar manager Satoshi Yonemori at Grapes & SodaGRAPES & SODAIn 2015, Grapes & Soda opened adjacent to its sister restaurant, Farmer's Apprentice, to accommodate overflow. Now, nearly three-and-a-half years later, the South Granville spot has evolved into much more than additional seating. \u201cIt\u2019s cozy and soulful, lively but laid-back,\u201d says bar manager Satoshi Yonemori, an acclaimed bartender in his own right, but who also honed his kitchen skills in other noteworthy restaurants.Yonemori explains that specific items don\u2019t stick around for very long because the menu evolves seasonally, and is dependent on what\u2019s available from the local farmers. \u201cChef Zachary Somjen is very talented and has been creating fun and delicious dishes,\u201d he says. \u201cHis daily specials are always hits and the seasonal mille-feuille is a must-try.\u201dHowever, the bar is one of the main draws, which is easy to believe when you witness Yonemori\u2019s expertly crafted Old Fashioned cocktail. \u201cIt\u2019s made of turbinado sugar, Angostura bitters, and overproof bourbon,\u201d he says. \u201cFirst we muddle sugar with bitters and slowly add bourbon over hand-chipped ice just out of the freezer. It takes time and patience, and we stir for a long, long time. The end product is a perfectly diluted, chilled cocktail in a frosted glass.\u201d He notes that while all the seasonal cocktails are popular, this particular one has lots of fans. \u201cWhether you stop in for a drink before dinner, or make a night of it, it\u2019s one of those spots you can\u2019t miss,\u201d says Alvarez.Photo by Rocky Mountaineer | Rocky Mountaineer\u2019s salmon with shaved-fennel \u2018slaw, local-market vegetables and mustard vinaigretteEXPLORE BEYOND VANCOUVERWhile this primer of must-try spots in Vancouver is a great way to discover a taste of Western Canada, it\u2019s just scratching the surface.
