The day our awesome assistant Gaby Melian yelled \u201cthat girl can EAT!\u201d as I beelined for a leftover steak was among the prouder\u2014and more mortifying\u2014moments of my career and life.But while some days in the Test Kitchen you\u2019ll find leftover steak, other days you\u2019ll find yourself seated in front of a platter of senior food editor Chris Morocco\u2019s ridiculously bonkers-good glossy Grilled Chicken Drumsticks with Savory Caramel and wonder how you got so lucky. These drumsticks are\u2014how do I put this\u2014pure chef kisses fingertips: tender meat, plenty of crisp charred spots, a finger-lickin\u2019 sticky glaze spiked with fish sauce that lent the drumsticks an irresistible funk. They remind me of one of the most delicious things I\u2019ve eaten in the last six months: the crisp Vietnamese fried chicken wings at Crawfish and Noodles in Houston, which are tossed in a sweet-salty glaze with, yes, plenty of fish sauce. I vowed to make them as soon as I could convince my (very territorial) dad to let me use his grill.Don\u2019t let the words \u201csavory caramel\u201d in the recipe title hoodwink you. I know it sounds complicated and time-consuming, but this recipe is neither! These drumsticks are one of four glossy gooey genius glazed meat recipes Chris developed for our summer grilling issue (out now!) that were designed to deliver the bold flavor of a marinade, but in a fraction of the time. You simply season a few packs of drumsticks with salt, then grill them covered, over indirect heat, until they\u2019re crisp, browned, and nearly cooked through. Grilling over indirect heat takes a little longer than letting the drumsticks rip over high heat, but it\u2019s crucial for preventing the drumsticks from getting weird and flabby and not properly crisp.And then there\u2019s the glaze. THAT GLAAAAAZE. I\u2019d never made a glazed meat that didn\u2019t involve most of a bottle of KC Masterpiece (mad love from the Chaey fam), but I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019ve been doing. Into a saucepan goes some water, grated garlic and lemongrass, and a small arsenal of pantry staples: rice vinegar, sugar, cumin, black pepper, and a mountain of crushed red pepper flakes. (Fair warning to the heat-averse, these wings are HAWT so feel free to start with 1 tsp. and taste first.) Let all that boil until the mixture is reduced to about a half-cup and thick and glossy (think teriyaki sauce). Once it\u2019s cool, stir in a few spoonfuls of fish sauce, then set some of the glaze aside for dipping the drumsticks in as you eat.When the chicken is almost cooked through, it\u2019s time to move those drummys over to high heat and hit them with sauce. I recommend using a pastry brush to do this if you have one, because it lets you easily dab a generous amount of glaze onto the drumsticks. The sugar and fish sauce in the glaze will caramelize in the high heat, creating plenty of those delicious charred spots, everything will get beautifully lacquered, and you will feel like your best Bob Ross painting happy little trees as you baste with your pastry brush. And, much like Bob and his trees, I\u2019m pretty sure the moments I\u2019ll be happiest this summer are when I\u2019m standing over the grill, painting my happy little drumsticks.Get the recipe:Grilled Chicken Drumsticks with Savory CaramelA savory caramel glaze that you\u2019ll be licking off your fingers all summer.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titGrillChickenRead MoreSticky-Sweet Grilled Pork ShoulderGrilled Salmon Steaks with Garlicky Yogurt SauceGrilled Pork Chops with Pineapple-Turmeric GlazeRecipes you want to make.
