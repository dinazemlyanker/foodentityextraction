It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Pink thingsWhat\u2019s pink and sweet and definitely not poisonous? A rhubarb daiquiri! I got excited and bought two bunches of rhubarb recently, using one bunch to make rhubarb compote that turned out a little...stringier than I wanted. So for the second bunch, last night I made hot pink rhubarb simple syrup (doubling this recipe), and plan to make rhubarb daiquiris with it this weekend. Is it still a daiquiri if I use tequila instead of rum? Don\u2019t know, don\u2019t care. Semantics! It\u2019s a refreshing, sweet-sour drink and you\u2019re gonna love it.Get the recipe: Rhubarb daiquiriWant this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!It might be okayThis month\u2019s \u201cis it ever okay\u201d is about summer entertaining. Can you take over the grill if someone is overcooking the burgers? Can you shoo away men trying to take over the grill because the burgers are in fact, perfect? All this and more, right this way. And now I\u2019m looking for your questions about fine dining etiquette. Can I demand a little stool for my purse because I think it\u2019s funny? Is tipping the coat check mandatory if dinner cost the same as a monthly car payment? Send your questions to me at staff.bonappetit@gmail.comRead it: Is It Ever Okay...To Take Over the Grilling Yourself?Photo by Haarala HamiltonBreakfast soupOver a cold brew* spiked with cinnamon and brain dust**, I asked Breakfast author Emily Elyse Miller what more people should be eating for breakfast. \u201cSoup!\u201d She said. Specifically, Hawaiian noodle soup with a dried shrimp and shiitake broth, spam, eggs, fish cakes, and saimin noodles (pictured above). It\u2019s rich and umami-ful, and nostalgic for the writer, who grew up in Hawaii. Miller, who was wearing a pearl-and-metal-spike necklace (very Sansa Stark goth mode), told me she feels amazing after having soup for breakfast, yes, especially in the summer. Regulate that body temp to acclimate to the heat outside! Her cookbook has 380 breakfast recipes from 80 countries and if you need to expand your breakfast horizons (I see you, boiled egg Bryan), I can\u2019t think of a better way.*At an event sponsored by CHAMELEON COLD BREW, HEL-LOOOO**Not sure if the brain dust works, but I\u2019ll take all the help I can getBrad went to CannesLol! Brad Leone went to Cannes Film Festival to judge a short film competition on the theme \u201cwe are what we eat,\u201d sponsored by NESPRESSO. He told me his favorite movies were the one about rice terraces in Bali (it\u2019s called Subak, and you can watch it, albeit on a narrow frame, here), and Mother Seed, about Rahibai Soma Popere, an advocate for farming with indigenous seeds in India (it\u2019s actually titled Seed Mother). Then he recreated the moment when he was trying to Instagram a seagull eating a pigeon, tripped, and dropped his phone down some rocks, filming all the while. Will be submitting that one to the jury next year.Potato salad! I\u2019ve made the potato-and-egg-and-bacon potato salad from B\u2019s Cracklin' twice already and it\u2019s not even June yet. It\u2019s perfect. There are BLACK OLIVES in it, what else do you need to know?MAKE IT: Potato Salad with Bacon and EggsMysteryWhy were two issues of Bon App\u00e9tit banned in Kansas prisons, as reported by the nonprofit Books to Prisoners? I\u2019d like to know! We don\u2019t even do nudity!Bucket newsMy Maldon bucket kicked the bucket this week. That thing lasted TWO YEARS and I used it pretty much daily. That\u2019s a good deal! 3.3 pounds of tiny salt windows into my soul! Read about how obsessed with it we are here. Then get one yourself ($30) and report back on how long yours lasted. I\u2019m vaguely curious.Unnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekLaura MurrayCarla Lalli Music was developing a blueberry pancake recipe this week and that\u2019s when we found out she LOATHES chocolate chip pancakes, which happen to be a perfect food. \u201cChocolate chip pancakes are disgusting,\u201d she said while tearing apart a concha on our snack table. \u201cI like to pretend pancakes are a breakfast food, not dessert. The chocolate chips make it dessert.\u201d The room erupted. Christina Chaey, nursing a 16-ounce Diet Dr Pepper, analyzed what makes a CCP great: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to put something in a pancake, what better than chocolate chips? Bananas? Stupid. Blueberries? Little pimples. Chocolate chips sink into batter just enough so they\u2019re on top when you flip them, then cook long enough so that the bottom of chip gets a tiny crust. You get molten chip, crispy edge\u2014it\u2019s the f*cking best.\u201d Jesse Sparks looked into my eyes and whispered behind his hand, \u201cPeople use too many chocolate chips\u2014they ruin the consistency.\u201d \u201cNo syrup,\u201d dared Emma Wartzman, \u201cjust lots of butter.\u201d \u201cNo, you need the syrup to play off the bitter chocolate,\u201d Chaey continued. In the Test Kitchen, Gaby Melian scrunched up her face and said, \u201cI don\u2019t like to find things in my pancakes.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not 12 anymore!\u201d Cristina Martinez told me as elevator doors shut in my face. \u201cI prefer buckwheat,\u201d said Chelsie Craig, before slinking off to the photo studio in a quilted capelet/shawl combo I\u2019ve never seen before. Hilary Cadigan offered her two-cents: \u201cI like blueberry and chocolate together!\u201d We let out a collective ughhhhhhh! Chaey shook her head in horror: \u201cAnd don\u2019t let anyone tell you to cook them with chocolate chunks. It doesn\u2019t work.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRhubarbRead MorecookingYour Most Pressing Rhubarb Questions, AnsweredBy Sarah JampelcookingChris Morocco Just Made the Best Chocolate Chip Cookie EverBy Alex BeggscultureJoy, Pain, and Puke at the 2019 Hot Sauce ExpoBy Alex BeggsPhotography by Amy LombardcultureMake These Chicken Thighs This WeekendBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
