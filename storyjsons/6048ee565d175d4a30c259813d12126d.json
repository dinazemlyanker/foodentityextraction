We asked 80 of the most interesting people we know to reveal the local spots they love the most.I grew up in New York City, where it seems like more than half the restaurants that open are out of business within a year or two, and even the successful ones serve at the whim of a fickle mistress\u2014her royal highness, the 10-Year Lease. If you get a bunch of New Yorkers together to talk about their favorite places to go eat, you\u2019ll hear a lot of \u201cit\u2019s not there anymore.\u201dThis is summer.\nPhoto by Alex LauBut I\u2019ve been going to Red Rooster Drive-In in Brewster, New York, for 32 years, and the older I get the more it stays the same. It is almost exactly halfway between my hometown and Lakeville, Connecticut, where my parents have had a \u201cweekend place\u201d since I was a young teen. The Rooster, as we like to call it, is a drive-up burger shack notable for its red-and-white-striped facade and a giant replica of a soft-serve cone perched on its pointy roof. It\u2019s one of those low-key legendary places that\u2019s also the perfect pit stop. There are exactly zero times that I\u2019ve driven by without someone else in the car saying, \u201cWho wants to stop at The Rooster?\u201dSimply an excellent fried chicken cutlet sandwich.\nPhoto by Alex LauThe answer to that question is always: I do! When I was in junior high, Friday nights meant sitting in the back seat of the family car with my parents and my little sister, listening to Graceland for the 900th time while my friends were definitely drinking beer and smoking cigarettes on somebody else\u2019s stoop. My standard order in those days was curly fries and a root beer float made with the Rooster\u2019s soft-serve ice cream\u2014so make sure to ask for hard-packed if that\u2019s what you want (that\u2019s what you want). It was around that time I discovered my mom loves chili dogs, which I still find shocking, and we all realized the fried chicken cutlet sandwich is excellent, but you have to get it with extra mayo, extra pickles, hot sauce, lettuce and hold the tomatoes (no matter the season, they\u2019re never great).The sea dog.\nPhoto by Alex LauAbout 15 years ago, my sister turned me on to the existence of the Sea Dog, which is a deep-fried fish fillet on a hot dog bun. Brilliant. Get extra tartar sauce\u2014it is stupendous! (The burger, however, is a sad little frozen patty, cooked up gray, no char, ordinary bun.)Where else would you want to be?\nPhoto by Alex LauOne of The Rooster\u2019s claims to fame is the outdoor grass-and-gravel picnic area, complete with bright red tables and kiddie rides, where the full mash-up of the clientele can be observed. There\u2019s the city folk like us, the locals, and the gangs of sweaty preteens in matching soccer uniforms getting team dinner after a game. There are lots of families with little kids too. I was never young enough to take advantage of the coin-operated mini-carousel or the horsey ride, but both my children have fed handfuls of my quarters into those things over the years.One of my offspring is now the same age I was when we started driving up to Lakeville, and boy, you should see the look on his face in the back seat on Friday nights when we\u2019re driving up. Sullen AF! And he doesn\u2019t even have to listen to Graceland! I get it\u2014his friends are home, plotting bad behavior of their own, probably. But when my husband asks if anyone wants to stop at The Rooster, he lifts his forehead off the car window: \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201dContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Explore Bon App\u00e9titNeighborhood RestaurantsSummerRecipes you want to make.
