See our past recommendations here!My love of books has always been a point of pride\u2014until I started renting a one-bedroom that\u2019s, well, not exactly spacious. Throw in the fact that I live with a masters student who collects political theory texts with the zeal of a manic librarian, and my precious stacks of novels started to feel more like clutter than prized possessions. Enter: Tortuga\u2019s Dumbo Bookend.These stackable steel arches are designed by Ciszak Dalmas in collaboration with Tortuga, a modular furniture company with an eye for mobility. I was instantly drawn to the \u201cSaraha\u201d trio, because desert landscape tones speak to my heart and match the houseplants slowly taking over my living room. (Yes, I\u2019m a millennial stereotype.) Best of all, the bookends can be turned to display a single prized item, like my copy of Where Cooking Begins. With a totally reasonable price point\u2014and a tidal wave of spring releases on the horizon\u2014completing my set just feels right. \u2014 Aliza Abarbanel, Healthyish assistant editor.Buy it: Tortuga Dumbo Bookend, $28\u2013$32.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
