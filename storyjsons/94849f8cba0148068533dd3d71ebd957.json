I\u2019m so hyped on sugar and the anticipation of sharing this month\u2019s best and beastly Trader Joe\u2019s snacks with you. For new readers (not you, Bobbi), this is my fifth year of persistently, honestly reviewing as many new foods as I can find in the aisles of America\u2019s kookiest grocery store. (And, bonus! We recorded a Trader Joe\u2019s\u2013obsessed episode of BA\u2019s Food People podcast.) My sworn oath: never, ever lie to you. So yeah, I was just kidding about the beastly thing, nothing this month is that bad. Except for the agave-sweetened Vegan Caramelized Onion Dip, a solid puck of sweet coconut oil unworthy of your chips or your dollars.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Now, to the newbies!Gluten-Free\u2019s the Way to BeGluten Free Organic Rolled Oats with Ancient Grains & SeedsOatmeal that\u2019s souped-up with quinoa and other fibrous whole grains that help you poop. You need to add your own maple syrup and brown butter and eye of newt\u2014whatever the hell makes oatmeal not taste like chalky, industrial mush. This one is not going down in history for me.Gluten Free Cinnamon Coffee Cake MuffinsBut these muffins are! When the first two ingredients listed are sugar and canola oil, you know you\u2019re in for a good time. These sour cream coffee cake muffins were as moist as a recently used dish sponge, even three days after I bought them. I love that in a baked good: indestructibility. Immortality! They have cinnamon crunchies on top that make the experience texturally dynamic. They\u2019re bound with gluten-free rice flour, but are they, really? I think they\u2019re bound by the magical thinking that makes people associate \u201cgluten-free\u201d with \u201chealthy.\u201d These muffins have no business being this good.Cocoa & Sea Salt Instant OatmealAnd here we have the hot cocoa oatmeal, as I call it, because that\u2019s what it is. The sea salt angle is great marketing and appeals to an audience who says they don\u2019t want chocolate for breakfast but OH, they DO. The cocoa flavor is a little dull, a little muted, like the month of January here in Michigan. Scoop in some peanut butter and you have REESE\u2019S OATMEAL.Things in PouchesMini Chocolate Chip Pancake & Waffle MixJust add water and you got yourself a floppy little chocolate chip pancake. Though I suspect buttermilk would be even better. A great option to take camping. Or to keep in your van, for all you van-lifers. Still out there, huh?Hemp HeartsWake up at 6:10 a.m., wash your face at 6:12, meditate at 6:16, make your smoothie with crunchy little hemp hearts at 6:47. These are the regimented steps I\u2019ve seen on TikTok of beautiful attempts to control one\u2019s own mortality. Not mine. My heart is hemp-less.SnacksyOrganic Cacio e Pepe PuffsPass on these puffs. They have that not-processed-enough stale quality, which is the trade-off that comes with buying organic puffs. I found the cacio e pepe flavor overplayed and yet, not played enough. The cheese powder barely tastes of anything other than your satisfaction from saying \u201ccacio e pepe\u201d into the empty, cold room.SeasoningsGreen & Red Hatch Chile FlakesI\u2019m riding the hatch chile hype train until my tongue goes numb. Spicy flakes! No complaints.BBQ 101 Seasoning BlendHeavy on the brown sugar. On popcorn, it reminded me of Lay\u2019s barbecue chips and the time I slapped sunscreen on my back but didn\u2019t rub it in well, resulting in two white handprints on my shoulder blades all summer. And it was a long summer. If you prefer seasoning with some heat, make this one.CheesyItalian Lagorai Semi-Soft CheeseThis is like farmer\u2019s cheese. It\u2019s creamy and so mild I won\u2019t even pretend I tasted anything. Use it to fill pierogies or make scrambled eggs luscious. Or better yet, blend it with some white wine and butter (oh, helllll yeah) and have yourself fromage fort, a French cheese spread that Jacques P\u00e9pin makes with nubbins of gourmet cheese and a single slice of American because he knows something the rest of us have yet to uncover. The secret to a long and happy life.Vegan Feta Cheese AlternativeA smooooth, smooth square of feta-flavored potato starch and coconut milk. It\u2019ll taste like the first time you tried cheap Brie in high school\u2014sour and farm-y and lactic and confusing, forcing you to question whether you know what\u2019s truly good in this world (and decide what you\u2019re going to have to pretend is). I don\u2019t need this kind of provocation from cheese. No thanks!Vegan Caramelized Onion DipEhhhhhhh. I thought Trader Joe\u2019s Vegan Cream Cheese Alternative was pretty decent, and I believe that\u2019s the base here, though it\u2019s a little too solid (from the cold coconut oil) and in need of a stirring and warming up to be dippable. Don\u2019t we all! But then they went and added agave syrup and gave it a funky sweetness that I didn\u2019t want to waste my precious Cape Cod chips on. They deserve better.Pizza Bread CheeseI\u2019ve encountered Scandinavian bread cheese at various Midwest farmers markets where sellers will give you oozy, grilled cheese samples on toothpicks cooked right there on a George Foreman. Irresistible! It\u2019s slightly squeaky, like Halloumi, with a spotty brown, bread-like crust, hence the name. Trader Joe was like, let\u2019s make it PIZZA-FLAVORED, because he knows his audience. Slice it, put it on bread, and slam it into the toaster oven. Six minutes later it\u2019s melted, bubbly, browned, and satisfying that after-school-pizza-bagel craving.FrozenKalua Pork Spring RollsThese pork spring rolls have so much fake smoke flavoring that I googled \u201cliquid smoke cancer?\u201d and found out that it\u2019s less carcinogenic to eat smoke-flavored foods than to eat smoked foods. How about that!Taiwanese Green Onion PancakesThese are golden and puffy in three minutes flat and I loooooove them.Chicken and Chimichurri EmpanadasMushy inside, but that\u2019s no crime. A thousand times better than the terrible Southwest Chicken Quesadillas.Impossible Chicken NuggetsCoulda fooled me!Okie Dokie Oat Non-Dairy Frozen DessertThe name is a clever play on \u201chokey pokey,\u201d a New Zealand honeycomb sponge candy. The bits of honeycomb in the ice cream add a fun, sticky crunch, but they have a butterscotch-y quality that reminds me too much of the awful sugar-free butterscotch candies we used to mail to my grandma\u2019s nursing home along with a nip of scotch-scotch hidden in some slippers (true story). I prefer the strawberry oat ice cream at TJ\u2019s.SaucyVegan Creamy Dill DressingMy new favorite salad dressing at Trader Joe\u2019s. Trust me, I was surprised too. The creamy cauliflower base has undergone some kind of treatment to not taste like cauliflower and the overall effect is downright ranch-y. Would buy again.Organic Chunky Homestyle GuacamoleFinally, a good guacamole at Trader Joe\u2019s. In college, I used to live on the square two-packs of guacamole, which have an unnaturally smooth texture that defies the will of the guacamole gods and offends most mortals from the kingdom of Texas. (I just read Circe\u2014loved it!) This stuff is chunky, as promised, not too watery, and seasoned with a few specks of jalape\u00f1o. Almost, almost as good as homemade.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCultureTrader Joe'sRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
