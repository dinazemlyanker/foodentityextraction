The artist expresses a fluid gender identity that they feel no urgency to categorize, one that thrives in ambiguity. And their signature nimbus of curls, deadpan humor, and wonky illustrations of \u201cpeople and animals with weird faces and weird outfits\u201d have moved front and center in the last few years. Two summers ago, Dresden created and starred in the comedy web series \u201c5 Things with Hilton Dresden,\u201d produced by Out Magazine. More recently, they designed the illustrations for Nicopanda\u2019s spring \u201919 capsule tee collection and hosted a number of enjoyably offbeat red carpet interviews for Out (their Call Me By Your Name red carpet coverage is chef\u2019s kiss a delight).When it comes time to reboot and recharge, Dresden looks to their friends and being present in the moment. \u201cI\u2019m a pretty extroverted person so hanging out with friends, having a drink, commiserating, and talking it out with people is probably the most healing thing for me. I\u2019m always in my head thinking about why I shouldn\u2019t be happy or don\u2019t deserve to feel good, and I know so many people struggle with that as well. I\u2019m here today to say, \u2018Fuck that. I\u2019m going to have fun.\u2019\u201dDresden soaking up the sun.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanShortly after we talked, the Trump administration had just announced a proposal to define \u201ctransgender\u201d out of existence. Dresden called the move an \u201cattack on the trans and gender non-conforming communities\u201d that must be fought against. In times like these, a solid night of rest can be both more imperative and harder to come by. We caught up with Dresden to see how they\u2019re handling the stressful days and restless nights.All good nights start with Sex and the CityI don\u2019t have a plan for each night or a certain skin mask I\u2019ll do, but when I get home, I like to watch some Sex and the City in bed while eating chips and salsa. I\u2019m a Carrie. I know a lot of people think they\u2019re a Carrie, but I\u2019m actually a Carrie. If you just look at the facts, you\u2019ll see. I have the hair and the insanity and the sort of lack of self-awareness. And I\u2019m a writer, and I dress crazy. There are definite Miranda undertones too.An essential bed trayI have this tray I bought at Ikea that lets me eat my meals in bed without as many crumbs and spills. I was certainly eating most meals in bed before, but now, with the tray, my hygiene has marginally improved.Curly hair maintenance planMy hair is a very wild creature, so I probably get it wet like twice a week, or once a week even, because it\u2019s so curly and I don\u2019t want to over do it on the curls. I recently got this new conditioner from DevaCurl after visiting their salon in New York. It\u2019s a silicone and sulfate-free conditioner, and it was way too expensive, and I won\u2019t be buying it again after I use up the bottle, but it\u2019s been working great. I\u2019ll sometimes do a mask and wrap my hair in a grocery bag. After I shower I scrounge in a lot of leave-in conditioner and sometimes coconut oil and different oils to help it stay hydrated. Aside from that, I just let it do its thing for the rest of the week. I really don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing in any aspect of my life, especially haircare.Beer, wine, or a tuna melt?I love alcohol. I love to indulge in some beer or wine before bed if I have it. As I mentioned, I love chips and dip, so if I have that around I\u2019ll definitely pull it out. But I don\u2019t usually have that many groceries in my house because I don\u2019t make it to the grocery store as much as I should. Sometimes I have to go out to the deli and get a tuna melt.A small bit of election joyI\u2019m grateful that Democrats have taken back the House, and that Wisconsin (my home state) voted out the scum that is Scott Walker. We still have a lot of work to do, but I\u2019m hopeful that things can get better, because they\u2019re so bad right now. I\u2019m also grateful to be working on a new web show, \u201cHilton Dresden Wants A Show,\u201d with my best friend and collaborator Talia Heller. Look out for it on cakeboymag.com!Will doodle for sleepThroughout my life I\u2019ve dealt with insomnia and had a hard time falling asleep. I\u2019ve always found that drawing and doodling in bed while watching TV is the best way for me to calm down. Reading is also really helpful. TV does not really help a person fall asleep. I\u2019m sure the screen is bad for that or something. I\u2019d like to stop rewatching The Office until 2:30 a.m. every night. I think that might help me get off to a better start in the mornings. I just read If Beale Street Could Talk by James Baldwin and that was really good. And I read Big Little Lies kind of recently, after I saw the show. The show was my favorite thing ever. The book is very, very good too.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishGoing to Bed withSelf CareInterviewsRead MoreLifestyleLeslie Diuguid Ends the Night With Surprise Ice Cream and a Good StretchBy Martine ThompsonRecipes you want to make.
