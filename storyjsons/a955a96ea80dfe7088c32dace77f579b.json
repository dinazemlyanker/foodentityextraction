This is my third time gathering the year\u2019s best cookbooks that also make fantastic gifts. I think really hard about it, trying to pair each book with the range of personalities out there. Even the grumps! Each pick answers \u201cyes\u201d to the question: Will they cook from it? But if, in the SLIM case this list didn\u2019t cover that person you\u2019re shopping for, whatever their deal is, get them Yossy Arefi\u2019s Snacking Cakes. The title alone brings me happiness, but so does the fact that there are multiple peanut butter cakes. The recipes are easy, and they all result in cake. Now who else are you shopping for?For the friend who memorized their grandmother\u2019s recipesOne of the year\u2019s best cookbooks is In Bibi\u2019s Kitchen, by BA contributor Hawa Hassan and Julia Turshen, a collection of grandmother-sourced recipes from eight African countries. The recipes are uncomplicated, comforting, and timeless, and the photos make them irresistible\u2014you can almost smell the peanutty kunde (stewed black-eyed peas) on sight alone. The photos make a point to show the arms and hands of the women who have held much more\u2014in their arms, and hearts\u2014than just the bowl of stew you see. Each recipe has an interview with the grandmother behind it, which makes the act of reading this cookbook like an intimate conversation around the kitchen table. What a beautiful feat.In Bibi\u2019s Kitchen$22 at Amazon$32 at BookshopFor the person who got into cooking this yearThey used to go out to eat three times a week, but during the pandemic they finally made their first banana bread (we all know at LEAST one person). Where do they go from here? Nik Sharma\u2019s The Flavor Equation, that\u2019s where. I don\u2019t want to call it part textbook because the word textbook makes it seem boring, when it is not. Sharma writes like the friend you text while you\u2019re cooking to ask, \u201cIf the shallots are black and disintegrating, is this \u2018burnt\u2019?\u201d and the friend replies back and calmly explains the Maillard reaction, the different smoke points of oils, without making fun of your pan of charred shallots. Plus, the recipes are fantastic with plenty of technique photos. I made the lamb kofta with almond gravy, and the hazelnut flan is next.The Flavor Equation$32 at Amazon$32 at BookshopFor the vegetarian, or the person who tries to live by the \u201cmostly plants\u201d ruleMeera Sodha\u2019s East is one of my favorite new cookbooks, and I\u2019m ordering a handful of copies to give out to friends, family, and my neighbor Michelle who I once chatted with while she grilled a spaghetti squash. WHY: The range of recipes, based on Sodha\u2019s travels around the globe, hop from a Sri Lankan cake here to an Indian curry there to a Japanese okonomiyaki over there. There are so many flavors at your fingertips. And the recipes are EASY. Every recipe is weeknight dinner material that happens to be vegetarian. I made the squash malai kari and a crispy Indonesian coconut-peanut condiment, serundeng, to top some brussels sprouts for dinner last week. Love, love, love this cookbook.East$29 at Amazon$32 at BookshopFor the cousin who sleeps with a Thermapen under their pillowYou know this nerd. Big fans of liquid nitrogen. They worship Harold McGee (get them Nose Dive, his new book on scent, too) and like to plan vacations around visiting molecular gastronomy restaurants. In Science and Cooking, they can read about the science behind some of those famous dishes as well as everyday dishes like macaroni and cheese (three Harvard professors explaining how mac and cheese works is my kind of dinner party). The reader can even perform mac and cheese experiments included in the book\u2014and make grape spheres and cigar ice cream, if the mood strikes.Science and Cooking$32 at Amazon$32 at BookshopFor the coworker who named their stand mixerBuy The Good Book of Southern Baking for the cornbread recipe alone. Okay, maybe also the cornbread madeleines, banana pudding, and buttermilk pie. Those are the first things I plan to bake from this buttery cookbook by Kelly Fields, the baker-owner behind New Orleans\u2019s Willa Jean, and Kate Heddings. It\u2019s a great gift for me, or anyone who has a collection of cake stands, pie dough in their freezer at all times, and a Southern accent when they drink too much tequila.The Good Book of Southern Baking$26 at Amazon$32 at BookshopAnother winning cookbook for bakers is Snacking Cakes\u2014whose recipes for peanut butter cakes I mentioned earlier. These are birthday cakes and midafternoon cakes that come together quickly and stressless. A friendly, fun cookbook for bakers of all experiences. Hel-lo, powdered donut cake!Snacking Cakes$17 at Amazon$22 at BookshopFor kids with elaborate play kitchensThey can\u2019t be trusted with knives yet, so buy them Fry Bread. This award-winning picture book, written by Kevin Noble Maillard and illustrated by Juana Martinez-Neal, centers around the Native American dish fry bread\u2014a puffy yeasted bread\u2014and ends with a recipe. Kids and a big bowl full of dough do mix. It\u2019s a beautiful book with a universal message about passing down recipes and culture through generations. (Fry bread has roots in American colonialism, but the kids will learn about that later.)Fry Bread$13 at Amazon$18 at BookshopFor my dad, or anyone looking for healthy dinner ideasMy dad is into cookbooks with a healthy focus, and I\u2019m glad because heart health is no joke. He loved Bobby Flay Fit so much I\u2019m not sure any cookbook will ever top it, but this year I\u2019ll try with Skinnytaste Meal Prep. He\u2019s currently on a gluten-free kick (daaad!), and there are plenty of GF recipes here to fit the bill, an entire freezer section, and a decent showing of brisket (brisket and barley soup, yum). I can see him getting excited about a lot of these recipes, from the turkey taquitos to the almond flour banana muffins.Skinnytaste Meal Prep$20 at Amazon$30 at BookshopFor the person who might already have all of these other cookbooksYou have to seek out an indie bookstore to find Jennifer McLagan\u2019s latest book, BLOOD, a cookbook of just what it sounds like: blood recipes. Like blood brownies and blood meringues and blood buckwheat crepes. McLagan\u2014whose books Fat and Bitter won James Beard awards\u2014had trouble finding a publisher due to the taboo around blood, which is crazy to me. It\u2019s a joy to read (\u201cMy supplier likens [blood] to orange juice; \u2018don\u2019t forget to give it a good shake before you use it,\u2019 he tells me every time I buy it.\u201d), and even if you\u2019re not in a rush to make blood pasta anytime soon, you will learn a thing or two about the history of cooking with viscous, iron-rich blood and and actually cook with it. It\u2019s a brilliant swap for egg whites in marshmallows, apparently. Definitely a unique gift.Blood$20 at Good Egg BooksFor the neighbor with backup tahini in their pantryI gushed over Falastin, a Palestinian cookbook by Ottolenghi right-hand man Sami Tamimi, in our spring cookbook roundup. And I stand by it\u2014I\u2019ve already given a copy to my friend who has never made the same hummus recipe twice (always in search of chickpea greatness). I look through Falastin for recipes I can marathon on a Saturday, a layered fish kofta casserole, doughy tahini buns, maybe I\u2019ll do a shawarma spread for a football game\u2014stuff that might take more time than I\u2019m willing to commit to after work. It\u2019s vegetarian-friendly too!Falastin$22 at Amazon$32 at BookshopFor the person who had to cancel a vacation this yearRosa Cienfuegos\u2019s Comida Mexicana is a much-needed vacation to Mexico, or the closest you\u2019ll get to one right now. It\u2019s not region-specific (Cienfuegos actually lives in Australia now, where she has a Mexican tamaleria and deli); it\u2019s more of an overview of Mexican street food favorites, from esquites to mangonadas. Cienfuegos\u2019s enthusiasm pops off the colorful pages with help from avocado-slinging lucha libre characters. You can sense a hint of homesickness, but she knows that the best cure for it is to bring Mexico wherever you are\u2014in your kitchen.Comida Mexicana$28 at Amazon$25 at BookshopLara Lee also has the cure for anyone homesick, or just deeply craving nasi goreng, in Coconut & Sambal, which centers around Indonesian food (Lee is half-Australian, half-Indonesian, living in London). It was just what I needed to get out of a cooking rut this fall. Think bright red, crispy-skinned, sambal-coated fish; kecap manis\u2013glazed pork belly; and all kinds of super textured salads (we have a few recipes from Lee here to give you a preview). An absolutely immersive, mouthwatering cookbook.Coconut & Sambal$32 at Amazon$32 at BookshopFor the person who needs to relax their Spindrift intakeJulia Bainbridge, who has contributed to BA, has written THE cookbook of coincidentally alcohol-free drink recipes. And our former staff photographer Alex Lau has made them look so frosty I thought they were condensing on the page. Get this for the person who makes the cocktails in your life; they have the cute bar cart, the fancy cherries. The fact that these recipes are nonalcoholic is beside the point\u2014this is a collection, as the title says, of GOOD DRINKS. A sour and sparkly grapefruit soda with pickle brine will put your flavored seltzer days behind you.Good Drinks$21 at Amazon$21 at BookshopFor the wannabe winoHow to Drink Wine is a fun read you can breeze through in one-to-three glasses of Chenin Blanc, depending on how heavy your pour is. It\u2019s a great gift for the person who gets excited when you bring a new wine over but is unsure how to explore on their own and how exactly do you say \u201cSauvignon?\u201d It\u2019s not a giant wine encyclopedia but a book you\u2019ll return to when you\u2019re like, \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with tannins again?\u201d Each grape varietal discussed has a list of \u201cIf you like ____, try ____\u201d that I\u2019ve used over and over. I\u2019m into Aligote now!How to Drink Wine$13 at Amazon$16 at BookshopThe shameless plug sectionSure, I\u2019m biased because Claire Saffitz worked at Bon App\u00e9tit and I cross-tested a couple of recipes, but her cookbook, Dessert Person, is gorgeous, and get this: not entirely desserts. I made the mushroom galette with crispy breadcrumbs and have seen too many pigs-in-brioche blankets on Instagram to count. But the desserts are showstoppers of all difficulties, from pretty little marcona almond cookies to colossal French pastry creations. Get this for the \u201cdessert person\u201d in your life, obviously!Dessert Person$16 at Amazon$32 at BookshopThen we\u2019ve got Serving New York, which BA senior designer Bryan Fountain cocreated with writer Kristin Tice Studeman. This is the arty-cool New York City\u2013centric cookbook for the diner who mourned the day Uncle Boons closed and doesn\u2019t want any other beloved restaurants to shutter during this ongoing pandemic\u2014100 PERCENT of the profits go to ROAR, a nonprofit that gives aid to restaurants and their workers. This cookbook is for anyone who also wants to make Momofuku\u2019s kimchi rice cake stew (me again).Serving New York$35 at Serving New YorkAnd yes! Our global brand ambassador Marcus Samuelsson has a new cookbook this year with coauthor Osayi Endolyn, The Rise, which you can also get in this *extreme shameless plug voice* holiday gift box that comes with a new BA tote and subscription. In The Rise, you can cook through recipes shaping Black American cuisine today, yesterday, and tomorrow, and read engaging profiles of chefs, including Mashama Bailey, BJ Dennis, and food scholar Michael W. Twitty. It\u2019s a piece of in-depth food journalism in cookbook form, a hell of a combination.The Rise$34 at Amazon$35 at BookshopExplore Bon App\u00e9titGift GuidesShoppingCookbooksHoliday 2020Recipes you want to make.
