She\u2019s 4\u20197\u201d and these American kitchen counters are too damn high. \u201cI\u2019m always on my tippie toes!\u201d she laughs. She\u2019s brought an entourage to visit the Bon App\u00e9tit offices (messy) and Test Kitchen (\u201csystematically organized!\u201d Kondo declared). We\u2019ve got her husband, two KonMari colleagues, and her interpreter, Marie Iida, the unsung hero of Kondo\u2019s new Netflix show, Tidying Up with Marie Kondo. We\u2019re chatting in the tasting room, a sort of prop kitchen where we host events and shoot branded videos. It\u2019s therefore the tidiest place in our office, complete with a fig tree, and Kondo loves it.Kondo, impressed at Test Kitchen manager Gaby Melian\u2019s spice cabinet.\nPhoto Courtesy of Marie KondoIn the show, Kondo helps American families declutter their home over a month\u2019s span. It\u2019s like Hoarders Lite. There\u2019s a lady who has too many Nutcrackers (Kondo will never tell her she has too many, but I\u2019m telling you, she has too many)\u2014a tame problem compared to the garages full of feral starving kittens on Hoarders. Tidying Up is like a vitamin, making the viewer energized to envision a cleaner, more organized home, filled with neat stacks of underwear folded into files.In her mega-bestseller The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, you declutter your house in a certain order. Clothes first, then books, papers, komono (miscellany), and sentimental items. The kitchen section, within komono, doesn\u2019t get as detailed as other sections. It\u2019s less about a vegetable peeler sparking joy, and more about learning to appreciate the utility the tool offers, and by the time you\u2019ve tidied your clothes, books, and papers, you have more of a sense of what should stay and what goes to Goodwill. We were curious about what Kondo cooks and how she keeps her own kitchen\u2014are there mismatched mugs and old pickle jars?! She was kind enough to give us a glimpse.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.The last thing I cooked was a rice dish cooked in fish stock, made in my donabe. I got the cooking bug last January. I\u2019ve always liked it, but when I got married, my husband was very much into cooking. So I got into it too. The first thing I cooked was a chicken soup that my mother taught me the recipe for.The kitchen tool that sparks the most joy for me is my donabe. I have three. Each has a different purpose, making miso soup or making rice.Typically, I start the day with tea. Green, white, or matcha. I like to make miso soup and rice. I prepare a little bento box for my daughter before she goes to school with Japanese omelet, sweet potato, chicken, and onigiri.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Then I almost always end the day with amazake, which is a traditional sweet, lower non-alcohol Japanese drink made from fermented rice.The most horrifying thing I\u2019ve seen in a client\u2019s kitchen was canned food that had expired 40 years ago. That was a surprise for me.Most people have too many tongs! And disposable plastic cutlery, what you get when you get delivery food, and packets of sauces. So many of them.When it comes to the plasticware* problem we should be using the same brands. I use Noda Horo\u2019s white porcelain containers with bamboo lids, which is popular in Japan. It makes it looks much neater and easier to keep track. I always encourage my clients to keep the box part and the lids separate. The lids you can store standing upright, but the box should be stacked together. This way, you can maximize your storage space.I don\u2019t have 100 spices, no. In Japan, you don\u2019t use many spices. You\u2019d much rather use liquid condiments, such as soy sauce, sake, and mirin, so those are all kept in jars. I only have five types of spices in my kitchen. Black pepper, salts, cumin powder, turmeric.A condiment that\u2019s always in my fridge is salted rice malt. You used to season meat before you prepare it. It makes meat very tender, and very flavorful.I take out the garbage twice a week. I wait until the trashcan is completely full. We do have a separate trash can for raw trash that gets composted.The last thing I KonMaried from my kitchen was nothing! I have the opposite problem. I always have very few items in the kitchen, so right now I\u2019m actually adding to it. Recently I\u2019ve replaced my cutting boards to something that truly sparks joy for me, made from Gingko trees. I\u2019m also in the market for a big, sharp knife.*We can\u2019t call it tupperware for legal reasons lol.Watch Tidying Up with Marie Kondo on Netflix here.Explore Bon App\u00e9titGet OrganizedCleaningPeopleRecipes you want to make.
