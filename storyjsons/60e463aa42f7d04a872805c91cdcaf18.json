It\u2019s got a way spicier bite than its cooked-through counterparts\u2014whether roasted until jammy and sweet, fried into chips, or infused into oil\u2014and a stronger, sharper scent. But that\u2019s why were here. To show you the magic of raw garlic. Are you ready to be sold?I\u2019ll leave the task to Andy Baraghani, who created a riff on a traditional Spanish ajo blanco\u2014a cold soup made of pur\u00e9ed blanched almonds, grapes, olive oil, sherry vinegar, and raw garlic. In his version, the soup is instead a sauce that can be drizzled over lettuce, spooned atop flaky white fish, scooped up by torn warm pita, or poured over crunchy, refreshing cucumbers. Make Cucumbers with Ajo Blanco Sauce and you\u2019ll be addicted to the stuff.Andy\u2019s version also nixed the grapes, a specifically sweet and slightly acidic flavor that would have made it less versatile. But the rest, is pretty much the same: All those ingredients, plus ice water, get pulverized in a blender until completely smooth. The ice water is key to a nice consistency, to mellow the grassiness of the olive oil and the garlickiness of the garlic\u2014and to keep the motor and base of the blender from overheating and making warm sauce (no thank you).Just one clove has so much flavor.\nPhoto by Alex LauThe recipe call for only one clove of garlic, which doesn\u2019t sound like a lot. But it is. For one, it\u2019s raw, which means extremely pungent. There\u2019s also a lot of fat in there, coming from both the almonds and the olive oil. As you may know, fat is the great carrier of scent and flavor, which means the garlic has a lot to cling to. \u201cIt also becomes more assertive the longer it sits,\u201d says Andy. \u201cIt will not be nearly as strong right after you blend it as it is even a few hours later.\u201dBut the best thing I learned about this sauce, is that it really a template you can play with. You can sub hazelnuts or cashews for the almonds, you can add some tender herbs, like mint or cilantro. You can throw in a chile for extra heat, or a spice like turmeric, cumin, or coriander. \u201cAnything that goes well with garlic is a good bet,\u201d Andy says.Which is just about anything we can think of.Get the recipeCucumbers with Ajo Blanco SauceThis ajo blanco sauce is rich from almonds, tart with sherry vinegar, and plenty garlic-pungent, it\u2019s what we\u2019re putting on everything we\u2019re making this season.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titGarlicSauceDipRead MorecookingFrom Now On, I Will Always Have a Jar of Garlic Confit in my FridgeBy Emma WartzmancookingSlow-Roasted Halibut in Garlic Cream, Because It Was a Hard WeekBy Alyse WhitneyRecipes you want to make.
