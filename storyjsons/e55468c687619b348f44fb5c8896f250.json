But I am no means a wine person\u2014a.k.a. I still only give somms vague directions, like \u201csomething not too sweet\u201d and \u201cnot too expensive,\u201d when I\u2019m looking for a glass, and definitely won\u2019t turn up my nose at whatever bottle a friend decides to pick from their local liquor store. I have, however, learned that a decanter is a great way to help said rando red wine taste a lot better. Our wine editor, Marissa Ross, says decanting is like stretching out your legs after a long flight\u2014the extra space and fresh air takes the edge off the juice and allows it to mellow out a bit. Yes, you could (and should!) also stick it in the fridge\u2014mediocre chilled wine is far superior to mediocre room temp wine\u2014but a decanter helps too. Plus, it has the added touch of looking good on your table. I love the curvy shape of mine, but our editor at large Andrew Knowlton digs his Mark Thomas MT Series Bottle (which he uses for a lot more than bottles of red). Either way, it\u2019ll get the job done. Just remember that if you want your wine to be better, it needs to breathe.
