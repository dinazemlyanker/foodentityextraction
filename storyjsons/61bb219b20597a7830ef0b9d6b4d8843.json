He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.When we launched our site Basically a couple of years ago, our mission was clear: tap into a swelling audience of young people who love food but might not know how to cook.It didn\u2019t quite work out as planned.Turns out you don\u2019t have to be a twenty-something to want to learn to cook. And even if you already do know how to cook, you can still value a simple, well thought-out recipe.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Take this week\u2019s addition to the site\u2014Molly Baz\u2019s Carrot Loaf Cake. We\u2019re an office that\u2019s passionate about our carrot cake. We have Claire Saffitz\u2019s showstopper version\u2014an elegant layer cake, swooshed with cream cheese frosting and dappled with candied carrots. (But optional raisins! Thanks, but no thanks, says Claire). It\u2019s the kind of cake you serve and then immediately take a bow.Alex LauAnd we have a gluten-free carrot cake which went up on Healthyish last year that people went bananas for (sorry to mix my cake metaphors). It subs almond flour for white flour and introduces a new flavor profile by adding coconut oil and coconut flakes. Our decidedly not-GF staff continues to rave about it.But if I\u2019m going to make carrot cake, I\u2019m not baking either of those. A. I just don\u2019t have the patience or precision to stack and level and frost a layer cake. (Though, I am 100 percent with Claire on the no-raisin thing; I can\u2019t stand \u2018em when they get all soft and squishy.) B. I\u2019m not gluten-free, so as alluring as Chris\u2019 riff for Healthyish is, that\u2019s just not my bag\u2014unless I have GF friends coming over for a dinner party.So, Molly\u2019s it is. I stare at the photo and I want to set sail in that sea of cream cheese frosting. I love the fact that she opted for ground ginger and cinnamon, but not cloves or star anise, because Basically recipes have a hard cap at ten ingredients. I watch the step-by-step video presentation of the cake, which Basically offers on all of its weekly featured recipes, and I can totally see myself making it. And c\u2019mon, who doesn\u2019t love a loaf pan?! I still dream about Molly\u2019s crazy-moist pumpkin bread with whipped maple butter, which was hands-down my favorite dessert we published last year (don\u2019t let the \u201cbread\u201d moniker fool you).Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Food Styling by Pearl JonesOn this week\u2019s upcoming Bon App\u00e9tit Foodcast (which drops Wednesday), I sat down with Molly, Claire, and Chris to debate the differences between their three cakes. We talked raisins (and walnuts), spices, round cake pan vs. loaf pan, and so on. The only bummer was that none of them brought their cakes to the studio. Apparently they all were busy doing, you know, their day jobs.Which means I\u2019m going straight to eatbasically.com this weekend and I\u2019m going to bake myself that (raisin-less) carrot loaf cake, even if I\u2019m no longer in my twenties and already know how to cook. It\u2019s that good.Get the recipes:Basically Carrot Loaf CakeThe most casual-cool carrot cake of all time.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterCakeRead MoreLifestyleThis Gluten-Free Carrot Cake Made BA Staffers Pretty Much Lose Our MindsBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
