While plating the dressed veggies on top of the vinaigrette makes for a more elegant presentation, this salad is just as delicious (though possibly a little less photogenic) when all of the elements are tossed together and allowed to marinate. Serve with grilled kielbasa and wedges of cold ripe watermelon for dessert.Ingredients6 servings1lb. cherry or other mixed small tomatoes, halved or quartered if large3small kirby or Persian cucumbers (about 10 oz. total), striped with a peeler, sliced into \u00bc\"-thick rounds4scallions, white and green parts separated, thinly sliced1\u00bdtsp. kosher salt, divided, plus moreFreshly ground black pepper\u00bdbunch radishes (about 8 small; 5 oz. total), grated on the large holes of a box grater116-oz. container cottage cheese, preferably large curd, 4% milk fat or higher3Tbsp. distilled white vinegar, divided2Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzlingPreparationStep 1Gently\u2014but thoroughly\u2014toss tomatoes, cucumbers, scallion whites, 1 tsp. salt, and 4\u20135 good turns of pepper in a medium bowl to combine.

Pour off accumulated liquid from cucumber-tomato mixture. (Reserve the liquid if you like; it\u2019s great over ice with or without a shot of vodka.)

I grated the radishes, added a tablespoon of the lemon-oregano-feta dressing from my salad, and mixed that into the cottage cheese.  I served the Greek salad over the top of the cottage cheese.  This was a big hit in our house, and I\u2019ve made it more than once.  Thanks for the inspiration. AnonymousCalifornia9/25/2020I'm not gonna lie. I may have saved some of the radish briney juciyness for the tomato cucumber vodka cocktail...AnonymousWhite Salmon, WA8/3/2020Thank you SO MUCH for a creative use of cottage cheese... I had some blueberries lying around, so instead of tomatoes + radishes, I used those instead. Also subbed ACV. I'm always looking for other methods of eating cottage cheese, and this really hit the spot! Will definitely be going into my regular rotation of \"I don't feel like making something for lunch but I know that I should eat\"jahgurlremyPortland, OR5/22/2020Cottage cheese is truly an unsung hero that is easy to forget about. This recipe is proof of that. Mixing with peaches or pears anytime of day is great to. Try it in your pancake batter for an extra little bit of protein and great texture. Cottage cheese it's not just for meat and threes! Love it.AnonymousChattanooga Tennessee5/5/2020Super weird but way better than I thought it\u2019d be!DaylebagCanada 10/6/2019I am making this AGAIN this weekend- I have made a number of variations of tomato-cucumber salads this summer and while many have been good, this was AMAZING.\nI did use apple cider vinegar in the final drizzle- but everything else the same.\nNot sure I will make the others any more at all.\nThanks!mcmargy10801Arizona9/7/2019I love how this recipe doesn't add a lot of superfluous flavors -- it allows those peak season vegetables to truly shine on a bed of creamy, salty, tangy dairy. I had to make some substitutions based on what I had lying around: greek yogurt with some feta mixed in for the cottage cheese; red onion for the scallions, grated into the dairy along with the radishes (and some rubbery zucchini); lemon for the vinegar. Ate with wasa crackers for lunch. *chef kiss*laschiMadison, Wisconsin9/4/2019Absolutely delicious!! It's light fresh salad and people need to stop judging it by other heavy flavored dishes. It is freaking great for what it is and I almost at the whole plate myself! VictoriyaLSacramento, CA8/29/2019Really average. I\u2019m a huge fan of BA and this is the first recipe of theirs I\u2019m disappointed with. I love cottage cheese (eat it everyday with lunch) and all of the veggies used (also part of my staples), but the flavor here was really one note - pretty much just salt and vinegar, which was my suspicion when reading recipe but I trusted in BA and followed exactly. I do think it\u2019s a good start or base to a recipe, and especially liked the radishes mixed with cottage cheese. But, there is a lot more flavor needed - I might try adding smoked paprika, or maybe even sumac to the cottage cheese mix, and play around with a proper dressing to the veggies (maybe balsamic Dijon). I am very hesitant to use plain distilled while vinegar in any recipe (why use a one note flavor when you could add other dimensions) and would swap out for lemon juice or a different vinegar - will continue to reserve white vinegar for cleaning my Nespresso only! AnonymousBoston8/29/2019I absolutely loved this salad. I had it without the kielbasa on the side.The only thing I didn\u2019t care for was grating the radish. I julienned them instead. I will be making this again!AnonymousFlorida 8/27/2019We loved it.  I don't even like cucumbers but put them in anyway - so fresh and quick to make!  I'll be making this one over and over!Lisa WarneNorthern suburb of Minneapolis8/25/2019Cannot say I loved this salad.  I love all the ingredients but it just didn\u2019t taste great.  I often eat cottage cheese on top of fresh jersey tomatoes.  I rather continue to do that.AnonymousNew Jersey8/24/2019This was a gd home run!!! LOVE the radishes mixed with cottage cheese, genius idea. Will definitely riff on this for the rest of the summer and beyond. anon89Berlin, Germany8/24/2019Looks great to me!  Of course, the negative comment, from someone who hasn't even tried the recipe, is \"anonymous\".AnonymousTannersville, PA8/23/2019Grew up in PA Dutch country with apple butter and cottage cheese. The thought of combining that with a fresh spin on Caprese salad is intriguing. I will definitely try this one!Lisette Dell'ApaBethlehem, PA8/23/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladCherry TomatoTomatoVegetableCucumberSummerEasySideGluten-FreeNut-FreeVegetarianLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
