At home, he likes to make double or triple batches of the coconut milk curry (see his recipe for All-Purpose Coconut Curry here) and freeze it in two-cup portions. Then, when he\u2019s ready for dinner, all he has to do is briefly marinate, then sear pieces of boneless skinless chicken thighs, boil the vegetables, and reheat the curry. If you want to prepare this recipe with premade curry, bring two cups curry to a gentle simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat, then add the seared chicken and cooked vegetables to the pan and simmer until the chicken is cooked through.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Didn't have gold potatoes,  red onions,  or mustard  seeds, so I used russet, yellow  onions,  and dried mustard.   Also used breast instead of thighs.  Came out  great.Charles  LChandler, AZ2/6/2022I often try to wing it with curries (I lived in India and always think I have a good feel for the food) but following this recipe, my curry was so much better. Not sure what it was, but the proportions of mustard seed, turmeric, lemon, etc must be spot on!HeatherPortland12/20/2021Fantastic. It works with baby yukon gold potatoes too, just make sure you boil them a bit longer.Kelas11/5/2021Absolutely delicious. A new favorite of kids and adults in my house. Takes a bit of time at the stove but well with it.Ray GrantBethesda, MD10/30/2021A splendid dish!
