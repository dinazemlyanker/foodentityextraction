One of the owners, who\u2019d been unpacking a limitless supply of boxes (boxes EVERYWHERE), was happy to oblige, and pointed us a bottle of Spanish natural wine to try. \u201cBut what can we have by the glass?\u201d I asked. He looked confused. You can have whatever you want!He opened me a bottle of light and bubbly red called Eroica Ancestral with a bandaid-sized, bubble-lettered label I could have printed off at home circa 2004. But it tasted like 2019. It was effervescent and barely acidic (a good friend to anchovies), made by a winemaker and somm in the city, Nuria Renom. (A digression: We ended up meeting Nuria the next night at Bar Brutal where she works, another natural wine spot with a full menu. What a delight! The Barcelona wine world is small.) My colleague Emily Schultz went a few months after me and had a funky, skin contact wine. I\u2019m not sure how long this everything-by-the-glass business model will last, but even if it doesn\u2019t...La Graciosa is a friendly, wine-nerdy place. There\u2019s a bookshelf of cool wines to drink or buy, a bar lit by hanging green globe lamps, a few tables and big wine barrels-as-tables, and a cozy, secret-feeling backyard. They have crispy breads and the aforementioned anchovies. It\u2019s in a cool neighborhood too, Gr\u00e0cia, and steps away from La Vermuteria del Tano, a tiny treasure of a corner bar with fragrant, delicious house vermouth from a big barrel I wanted to wrap in bubble wrap and take home. But my suitcase was already full.I had purchased a bottle of La Graciosa\u2019s Eroica Ancestral, which I opened a few weeks ago back in New York. It was a wonderful flashback no Facebook memory could compete with, like receiving a delayed postcard from wine-drunk vacation me. Oh hello, old friend. Until we meet again in Barcelona.Go there: La GraciosaExplore Bon App\u00e9titSpainWine Barsnatural wineHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
