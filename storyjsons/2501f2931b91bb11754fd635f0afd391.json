But while scented candles are my usual go-tos, eating turkey redolent of tuberose and patchouli isn\u2019t exactly the most appetizing. That\u2019s why I focus my holiday tablescape energies on unscented candles in an eclectic mix of shapes and colors. See: an amber tower of river rocks, a pyramid with golden inlay, a bust that could have been sculpted by Michaelangelo, a pair o\u2019 legs. These sculptural beauties bring the vibes but let the stuffing biscuits speak (er, smell) for themselves. Plus, putting a few different kinds together on the same table makes the fact that none of my plates match look intentional.\u00a0Rock Cairn Candles$57.50 at Amazon$55 at EtsyAreaware Totem Candle$20 at Amazon (Large candle)$60 at Food 52 (Set of 3)David Bust Candle$79 at Wolf and BadgerTwist Duo Standing Taper Candle$40 at Urban OutfittersBrushed Brass U Candle$120 at Food52Baby Won\u2019t You Light My Legs Candle$75 at Nordstrom$75 at Dada DailyHay Pillar Candle$59 at End.Tan Soy Wax Candle Set$95 at SSENSENanao Japanese Candles$68 at JinenWavy Candle$16 at EtsyMilk Candle$35 at GessatoPink Knubby Candle$45 at SSENSEBalloon Dog Candle$27 at EtsyMarbled Candles$13 at EtsyHay Twist Candle$35 at End.Rose Gold Rimmed Ivory Geometry Candles$150 at CaiCai HandmadeStack Tower Mother & Child Candles$88 at Mohawk General StoreExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingCultureEntertainingRecipes you want to make.
