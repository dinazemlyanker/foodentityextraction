Or for a big way to celebrate something big (there are magnums!). Whatever your reason is for popping open a bottle of Champagne, The Riddler has some seriously special bubbles to get your night started.ORDER THE: Champagne! Owner Jen Pelka and her enthusiastic, knowledgeable team stock over 100 bottles of Champagne and curate a not-too serious by-the-glass list (See: \u201cA Joan, for when you\u2019ve had a hard day, a glass of cheap house wine...filled all the way to the rim.\u201d). If you\u2019re feeling peckish, get one of the tater tot waffles, which are just as good as they sound.THE VIBE IS: chill, despite how busy it can get. It feels like you\u2019re dropping in at a friend\u2019s house party, where you can squeeze at the wood bar decorated with vintage Champagne buckets or sprawl out at a table for a hour or two. If it\u2019s warm out, snag one of the two-tops on the sidewalk and imagine you\u2019re in Paris, sitting on the rattan chairs and sipping a condensation-dotted glass of sparkling wine.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Tuesday to Thursday 4 p.m. to 10 p.m., Friday 4 p.m. to 11 p.m., Saturday 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., and Sunday 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Closed Monday.
