Who is able to do so with ease, and who is not? For writer Fariha R\u00f3is\u00edn, dissecting such questions are part of her M.O. Her work explores how self-care can function not just as self-indulgence but a radical form of self-preservation, and that exploration extends beyond the page and into her personal life too.Fariha making turmeric tea before bed\nPhoto by Emma FishmanAs a queer, Muslim, femme daughter of immigrants, R\u00f3is\u00edn admits to at times feeling \u201ca lot of guilt and a lot of shame for wanting to care for myself.\u201d But she\u2019s learned at least one solid practice: preparing for a good night\u2019s rest. \u201cA bad night of sleep will terrorize me the next day,\" she says. \"I know I'm happier, more open and a cognizant, generous person when I stay true to my sleep routine.\u201d Here, R\u00f3is\u00edn shares a few of the ways she winds down after a long day\u2014and, yes, there\u2019s wine involved.Natural wine after a stressful dayA nice, sparkling ros\u00e9 pet-nat is what I want when I\u2019ve had a really shitty, long day. Ironically, I didn\u2019t grow up drinking. I\u2019m Muslim, so it\u2019s not a thing that was readily accessible to me. But when I did start drinking, a couple years ago, I decided I wanted to be really ethical about what I was intaking. Natural wine has so many health benefits, I don\u2019t get the hangovers, the sugars are lower, and there\u2019s no nasty additives. I really appreciate that purity. The artistry and the care that goes into cultivating the grapes, and just the way that it makes you feel\u2014there\u2019s a very particular kind of experience when you\u2019re drinking natural wine. I could be a complete asshole, and that\u2019s maybe not true for anybody else, but, for me, it\u2019s almost spiritual.Self-care starts with a shower\nPhoto by Emma FishmanEvening showers and aromatherapyI\u2019m definitely a shower in the evening person. I have to feel clean before going to bed, otherwise I can't fully rest. My friend Jenna Wortham told me about how great eucalyptus leaves are\u2014they\u2019re like six dollars from any corner grocery store. I hang them in the shower, and when the hot water hits the leaves, it turns into eucalyptus steam. It\u2019s such a wonderful thing.Post-shower oilsI love the Italian brand Santa Maria Novella\u2019s skin tonic. It comes from Florence, and it\u2019s a 600-year-old company made by monks. I use that all over my body. I use Everyday Oil, which is really wonderful and has lavender in it which is really good for sleep. I\u2019ll put on Lucas\u2019 Papaw ointment on my lips. I also started making my own oils for myself and putting them into little bottles. Argan and avocado are really good for dry skin, so I used them as a foundation for the oil I make. Jasmine is also one of my favorite scents, and I get it cold-pressed from Abu Dhabi, cultivated the way Arabs create perfumes, so it's a darker, more pungent jasmine. Altogether, it nourishes my skin in the way I like best. It\u2019s nice to use something I\u2019ve created. That\u2019s how I like to live: Do it on your own and see what happens.Her current skincare lineup\nPhoto by Emma FishmanA cup of turmeric tea before bedI grew up drinking golden milk; it\u2019s a huge part of my culture, and turmeric has many healing properties. A couple of years ago, I started to make it myself. I make it from scratch, using coconut milk or almond milk, cinnamon, cardamom, and some maple syrup or honey, and I\u2019ll make it to drink before bed. It\u2019s something that I\u2019ve found actually calms me down and brings me back to my body. It takes the anxiety of the day out so I can just relax.Create your own ritualsI find the act of completing a ritual to be really healing and almost more important than the ritual itself. It\u2019s like an offering to yourself. Taking that extra moment to moisturize my body even if I\u2019m really tired and having a bad day, or having that shower: I force myself to do it every day, even when I don\u2019t want to. My body recognizes that it\u2019s time to sleep, and it naturally gets tired.Good sheets mean a good night's sleepMy bed has to look appealing. Sheets are super important to me, and I recently heard about these silk pillowcases from this makeup artist I worked with on a shoot and purchased those, so I feel like that will add a lot to my sleep routine.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishGoing to Bed withprofileRead MorecultureBody Scrubs, Feather Robes, and Other Failed Experiments in Self-CareBy Jenna WorthamRecipes you want to make.
