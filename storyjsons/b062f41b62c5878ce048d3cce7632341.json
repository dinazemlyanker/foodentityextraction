Roast potatoes directly on rack until tender, 60\u201370 minutes. Let sit until cool enough to handle.Step 2Meanwhile, heat 2 Tbsp. butter in a large saucepan over medium-high until melted and foaming. Add lobster shells and cook, stirring often, until bright red, about 5 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, until it starts to brown and stick to pot, about 1 minute. Add wine and cook, scraping up browned bits, until almost completely evaporated, about 3 minutes. Add yellow onion, garlic, celery, carrot, bay leaves, peppercorns, and 4 cups water. Toss in a generous pinch of kosher salt and bring to a boil over medium-high. Reduce heat and simmer briskly until liquid is reduced by two-thirds, 50\u201360 minutes. Strain stock through a fine-mesh sieve into a heatproof measuring glass; discard solids. (You should have about 1\u00bd cups.)Step 3While potatoes are cooling, warm half-and-half and remaining 2 Tbsp. butter in a medium saucepan over low heat just to melt butter.Step 4Split potatoes lengthwise and scoop flesh into half-and-half mixture. Smash with a potato masher until mixture is smooth and lump-free; season generously with kosher salt and pepper. Remove from heat and mix in egg yolks, dill, and horseradish; cover with plastic wrap.AssemblyStep 5Melt butter in a clean large saucepan over medium. Add pearl onions and carrots and cook, stirring, until onions start to turn translucent, 5\u20138 minutes. Sprinkle flour over; stir to combine. Cook, stirring, until flour leaves a film on bottom of pot, about 4 minutes. Stirring constantly, gradually stream in stock, then bring to a simmer. Remove from heat and stir in half-and-half; season sauce with kosher salt and pepper. Let cool slightly.Step 6Arrange lobster pieces in a shallow 1\u00bd-qt. baking dish and ladle sauce over. Dollop mashed potatoes on top and use the back of the spoon to spread across surface, creating decorative swirls. Sprinkle with sea salt. Bake on a foil-lined baking sheet until lobster is cooked through and filling is bubbling around the edges, 20\u201325 minutes. Turn on broiler and broil pie just until topping is browned in spots, about 1 minute. Let rest 5\u201310 minutes before serving.Step 7Do Ahead: Pie can be assembled 1 day ahead; cover and chill. Bring to room temperature and uncover before baking.How would you rate Lobster Shepherd\u2019s Pie?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleThis was an unmitigated disaster! After much expense, $75 give or take, and even more work and effort, I was left with a dish I could hardly finish. The potatoes were dry, the broth wasn't flavorful enough despite my multiple additions of salt/pepper, the pearl onions were way to big and the lobster came out like a rubber toy. I was so disappointed. I am going to try to salvage it though. Make lobster salad out of it, maybe it'll tenderize a bit in lemon juice and mayo? Fingers crossed but avoid this recipe. AnonymousBronx4/17/2018Made this last night for a friends birthday who loves lobster.  It takes a while to make but the end result is amazing.  Only thing i forgot was to add the remaining half and half to the sauce.  We didn't miss it.  The lobster was perfectly cooked, the sauce was decadently smooth and very rich the potato topping with dill and horseradish was fantastic.  Would definitely  make againAnonymousWilbraham3/3/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titSavory Pie & TartLobsterShellfishSeafoodMainNut-FreeRoastDinnerRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
