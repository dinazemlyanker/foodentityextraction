The one exception? Sour cherries. (Okay, so they usually come in a glass jar, but it\u2019s the same idea.)Sour cherries are a variety of cherry that are, as their name suggests, tart and sour. Like their sweeter counterparts, sour cherries are only around for a couple of months in May and June, when we fill our tote bags with them. But unlike their sweeter counterparts, they\u2019re too acidic to eat fresh out of hand, unless you like to pucker up. We like to pit them and bake them in pies and other summer desserts (even this pizza!). When you don\u2019t have time (or patience) to pit pounds of cherries, or get caught out of season and can\u2019t find them\u2014go to the jar. Jarred cherries are available all year round and will impart the same flavor to whatever you\u2019re cooking.Who needs sprinkles when you have beautifully tart sour cherries?\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigThere are several brands out there, but senior food editor Chris Morocco is partial to Trader Joe\u2019s Dark Morello Cherries in Light Syrup (Morello is a variety of sour cherries), which, you can find online.\u201cNo matter the brand, the most important thing is that they must come in a light syrup,\u201d Morocco says. \u201cIf it\u2019s a heavy syrup, that means they\u2019ll be coated in an ultra-thick, ultra-sweet liquid. Light syrup is just mildly sweetened water, perfect for containing the cherries but not turning the whole jar into a viscous, tooth-ache-inducing mess. The cherries retain their shape and biting flavor, and you can easily drain them before you use them.\u201dDrained, they\u2019re still quite sour, though toned down from being packed in sugar syrup, which is why we like to use them for baking. They\u2019re a great sub for rhubarb in this Buckwheat Rhubarb and Strawberry Galette, since rhubarb isn\u2019t the most readily available produce. You can toss them in sugar and throw them in a cake, like this Easy One Bowl Upside Down Cake. They\u2019re fantastic in pies, or mixed into yogurt for breakfast. Try cooking them down with some sugar and water, giving them a compote-like consistency to spoon over ice cream. They\u2019re truly the cherry on top.Now get baking:Explore Bon App\u00e9titCherryFruitShoppingRead MoreshoppingCanned Cherry Tomatoes Exist and Our Food Editors Love ThemBy Elaheh NozariRecipes you want to make.
