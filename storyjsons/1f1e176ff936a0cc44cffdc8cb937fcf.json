See our past recommendations here!I love a good burger, but I\u2019m always more interested in the bun (gotta be a potato roll) and the condiments (charred onions, Dijon, and a juicy tomato, please!) than whatever patty is in between. So when I decided to start eating less meat, veggie burgers were an obvious swap. I knew I\u2019d find some palatable options\u2014and I did\u2014but I didn\u2019t expect to find a burger I truly craved. And I definitely didn\u2019t expect that burger to be made of kelp.The veggie burgers I speak of are the newest launch from AKUA, a company that\u2019s been selling kelp in the form of dried jerky since 2019. What I love about these burgers, along with the fact that the ingredient list includes mushrooms, pea protein, black beans, and quinoa, is that their texture is uniform\u2014no stray corn kernels or bean skins in sight. It\u2019s chewy, salty, and smoky, and while nothing about the taste screams \u201cseaweed,\u201d there\u2019s definitely a note of brine in there. Size-wise, this veggie burger is thick enough to make its presence known but thin enough to leave room for all those toppings I love. I\u2019d eat it even if it weren\u2019t made of a super-cool, planet-saving seaweed.Quick primer on kelp: When it\u2019s ocean-farmed, kelp is a zero-input crop, meaning it doesn\u2019t need to be watered, fertilized, or fed in any way, nor does it need cleared land to grow\u2014it\u2019s under the sea! And not only is kelp lower maintenance than your pandemic haircut, it also gives back: The crop actually pulls carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. According to the BBC, scientists estimate that seaweeds of all kinds (including kelp!) sequester nearly 200 million tons of greenhouse gas every year\u2014which is as much as New York State\u2019s total annual emissions. It\u2019s so nice when sustainability and deliciousness work together.AKUA veggie burgers ship frozen and are made to go straight from freezer to grill (or skillet). When I make them, I start my onions first, then throw on the burgers five-ish minutes before the alliums are charred to my taste. Just a few minutes on each side is enough to heat the burgers through and get a nice sear going. Then all that\u2019s left to do is assemble and crack open a cold bev. AKUA, if you\u2019re reading this, I have three words for you: kelp beer, please.Photograph Courtesy of Akura / Yellow ImagesThe Kelp Burger$49 at Akua \u2013 12 PackExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish Loves ItShoppingBurgersVeggie BurgerRead MoreLentil BurgersEasiest-Ever Grilled Veggie BurgersRecipes you want to make.
