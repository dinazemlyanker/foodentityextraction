The World Had Other Plans.Instead of a boyfriend, I got a global pandemic, \u201cLove Is Blind,\" and a new understanding of connection.By Lily DiamondMay 4, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhotographs Courtesy of NetflixFacebookTwitterEmailThis story is part of the Healthyish Guide to Being Alone, a series of tips, recipes, and stories about how to be alone when we\u2019re together and together when we\u2019re aloneTucked in bed next to me, my iPhone screen glows with two new Bumble notifications\u2013\u2013chipper reminders that finding love today is nothing like it used to be. \u201cStay inside and get your daily dose of human connection,\u201d the app quips. \u201cPhysical distance \u2260 loneliness. Keep connecting safely online.\u201dAll day long my screen is alight with these safe, cyber connections\u2014forced distance and technology making it easy for people to blip into and out of each other\u2019s lives. I\u2019ve gotten FaceTime requests from people I haven\u2019t talked to in a year, Marco Polo video chats from distant relatives. My Instagram feed is flooded with Lives, bloggers baking, artists leading painting-dance-knitting classes, healers proffering free Zoom sessions, teachers advising weary parents, business owners coaching each other to innovate, celebrities admonishing the young and restless for not staying home, and nearly everyone claiming an ecstatic, loving authority to be there for you, whomever you may be.I am swimming in digitally delivered oxytocin, yet like many who share the privilege to stay home, I am also more alone than ever. But that\u2019s not just because of the pandemic.In December of 2019, I moved from Los Angeles to Maui, Hawai\u2019i, the place where I grew up and part of the world\u2019s most isolated archipelago. The new decade, I\u2019d decided, would not just be good, it would be transformative. I\u2019d reconnect with a community and grow my own food; we\u2019d elect a sane human to be president; and, most definitely, I\u2019d find love after a decade-long romantic dry spell. 2020 would be the year I redefined love\u2014of all kinds.Clearly, 2020 had other plans.My iPhone chirps out yet another Bumble truism, but this one I ignore. I\u2019m now focused on something far more urgent: The final episode of Netflix\u2019s \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d. The reality TV show offers an addictively irrational universe in which a \u201csocial experiment\u201d separates male and female participants, placing them in isolation pods where they are required to \u201cdate\u201d the human on the other side of the wall. Here, success means falling in \u201clove\u201d over the course of a week (or less), sight unseen, and executing an emotionally overblown marriage proposal from within the isolation pod.At the show\u2019s start, participants revel in the ways that dating \u201cblind\u201d is teaching them to articulate and connect over values, rather than fixate on physical attributes. They\u2019ve skipped over lust to the part where they find out what could carry a relationship into the long-term. Once the successfully betrothed lovers meet face-to-face, they\u2019re whisked off to a Mexican beach vacay and a thirty-day countdown to their wedding.Then comes the real work: Can they sustain the connection, even when the high wears off and the person in front of them is maybe shorter than expected, kind of annoying, smells a certain way; is a body and a mouthpiece whose values are as aspirational as they are realistic? Can they relinquish life-long habituation and self-interest to prove\u2014as the show\u2019s hosts are fond of asking\u2014that love truly is blind?From the confines of my own isolation pod (aka home), life was beginning to look a lot like reality TV. In every available form of media, on every possible screen, lonely folks in quarantine were seeking connection-at-a-distance, hoping the abstract love beaming from Instagram Lives, FaceTimes, and Zooms might sustain them through the pandemic.I get it. Like several of the women on this whiplash of a series, I\u2019ve built a life and a livelihood online\u2014I\u2019m an \u201cinternet person,\u201d as blogger Joy Wilson puts it. The closest I come to coworkers are colleagues who live thousands of miles from me, and the four walls of my home are always my workplace, not just during a pandemic. This is both privilege and curse, for as much of a freedom as it is to make my own hours and publish my own writing, working from home can be its own kind of self-fulfilling isolation prophecy. I spent the better part of the last decade searching for ways to be less alone, less screen dependent, and yes, less single.After seven years living by myself in California, I hit a wall of loneliness. I\u2019d built the business, amassed the readers, published the book, done the workouts, nurtured the community, braved the therapy, doubled down on the self-love, vibed the manifestations, and yes, gone on hundreds of online dates that rarely lived up to their on-screen promise. Still, I was alone. At thirty-six, friends were having second kids and buying homes while I took my third-wheeling skills to black-belt levels and learned to mainline connection through a screen.The irony of my pre-Covid move from L.A. to Maui is not lost on me. Several months into the new year, I have gone on zero dates. I spend more time than ever staring at a screen. Instead of a boyfriend, I got a global pandemic and \u201cLove Is Blind,\u201d two fates (and lessons) perhaps deserving of each other.As the couples in \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d start spending time together in person, they quickly realize they don\u2019t actually know\u2013\u2013or necessarily even like\u2014each other. With a few exceptions, their love is performative and fleeting, born of dating app swipes, social media addiction, hollow \u201comg I love you\u201ds dropped on YouTube. In \u201creal\u201d life, Damian can\u2019t stand Giannina\u2019s social media use and iPhone addiction. Carlton is terrified to disclose his bisexuality. Amber forgot to mention her piles of credit card debt. Lauren doesn\u2019t know if she wants to give up \u201cpersonal space forever.\u201d Kelly doesn\u2019t orgasm easily. And Jessica can\u2019t open up to Mark without a wall between them, never happier than when he engineers a date that replicates the isolation pods.At one point, Jessica says something that makes me stop, mid-Insta scroll: \u201cSomething about being in this pod-like scenario brings down the walls, and you just open up.\u201dIt\u2019s everything I\u2019ve been feeling and seeing in quarantine: that hazy projection of love into the digital cosmos that delivers a sense of being heard and supported, even if it\u2019s an illusion.As an \u201cinternet person,\u201d I know firsthand the way screens\u2014like the walls that separate \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d\u2019s participants\u2014allow me to edit and share my life, curating a virtual self far more palatable than the realities of full-spectrum me, in flesh and (monthly) blood. I know there is no substitute for the other, real me. Like there\u2019s no substitute for physical attraction in a romantic relationship, or getting to know someone over the course of months or years rather than days. And that feeling of opening up\u2013\u2013whether in isolation, or from the protective distance granted by a screen\u2014might be a euphoric taste of intimacy with self and the illusion of empathy, but it\u2019s not the same as being vulnerable, as showing up, in person.Dating during quarantine feels almost unimaginable. But inside this collective isolation experiment, as weeks expand into months, as markets crash, death tolls rise, and unemployment numbers soar, I catch glimpses of a love that feels less illusory and more tangible. It\u2019s a love that demands to encompass entire communities, including people I will likely never meet. Or as author and historian Ibram X. Kendi tweeted, \u201cWe are all realizing how interconnected we all are as we distance ourselves from each other.\u201dWhat does it look like to actually hear and support each other right now, when inequities of access to food, health care, and safe shelter are laid so very bare? It\u2019s easy to be a staunch, anti-racist feminist\u2014or an eternal font of \u201clove and light\u201d\u2014from behind a smartphone keyboard, but what happens when a pandemic presents the clear opportunity to show up for people who do not look, talk, or live like me? The choices I make right now, from six feet apart, speak far louder than any performative activism or virtual love.Here on Maui, I\u2019ve been trying to scroll less and do more. I grow my own food and barter with neighbors. I deliver weekly hauls of avocados to the unsheltered. I am more patient with my father, and more connected to my community\u2014more willing to address people\u2019s most urgent needs for food, masks, tents, five gallon buckets to use as toilets\u2014than I was before I was distanced from it.The Greeks might call this something like pragma: a realistic, mature love born of experience over time, compromise, and mutual exchange. Erich Fromm described it as \u201cstanding in love,\u201d but I\u2019d say it\u2019s more like moving, or acting, in love. Pragma is what\u2019s being asked of us, whether we\u2019re sheltering at home or working on the front lines of the pandemic. It\u2019s a call to show up, to love by seeing and responding to what\u2019s on the other side of the pod wall. For the two couples who manage to get and stay married on \u201cLove Is Blind,\u201d pragma is the glue.This wasn\u2019t the definition of love I expected, or even wanted, but it\u2019s the one I got. And now, the real question: will it last when the pod walls come down?Every evening I say goodnight to my iPhone and fold myself into an isolation chamber of my own making, king-sized pillows on either side of my body. I imagine the future the way we all do these days: not a two-year or five-year plan, but just three months out, maybe six. Will I still barter seeds and bring food to the unsheltered? Will I remember it feels good to be closer than six feet apart? Will I crave the messy, the human, the contagion of sex? Will I be able to build a generous, meaningful life from this blueprint of love we\u2019re all drafting\u2014separately but together\u2014in the face of global crisis, extreme income inequality, climate change, and mandated isolation? And will it prove that love really is blind?I think it\u2019s time I learn how to love with eyes wide open.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishCoronavirusHealthyish Guide to Being AloneessayRead MorecultureLeading a Virtual Dance Party Is What I'm Living For Right NowBy Hilary CadiganRecipes you want to make.
