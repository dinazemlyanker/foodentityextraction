Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,Yesterday\u2019s news about Alabama effectively banning abortions, even in the case of rape and incest, was troubling and terrifying for a lot of us. For me and many others born after Roe v. Wade, the legality of abortion has always been a given, a right we never questioned. Now, as states challenge and chip away at that right, and with a conservative majority on the Supreme Court, it feels like the beginning of a post-apocalyptic future (All that Handmaid\u2019s Tale protest attire really drives the point home).This New Yorker interview with a Supreme Court reporter was perhaps the most chilling thing I\u2019ve read on the subject in the last few days. Linda Greenhouse explains that the Supreme Court is unlikely to overturn Roe v. Wade in a single ruling. The more likely scenario, she says, is that they\u2019ll gradually erode the precedent through rulings that are more narrow in scope, like requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at certain hospitals. \u201cThey could uphold this obstruction, and they could uphold that obstruction, and they could send all these signals,\u201d Greenhouse says. \u201cAnd so, if Roe finally falls, it\u2019ll fall with a little push of a pinkie, rather than a frontal assault, because there won\u2019t be much left of it.\u201dEach week in the Healthyish newsletter, I share my personal perspective. I talk about how we feel good in our bodies, whether that\u2019s through the food we cook, how we move, who we\u2019re with, or how we treat ourselves. And I talk about the things that get in the way of feeling good, like illness, stress, and mental health. I talk less often about the politics and privilege of feeling good: Who can afford fresh, healthy food and therapy and who can\u2019t? Who has the time and support to take care of themselves and who doesn\u2019t? Who has access to healthcare that respects a person\u2019s agency over their own bodies, and who is being denied?Today I\u2019m thinking about that last question, and I\u2019m donating to the ACLU, who\u2019ll be taking the state of Alabama to court, and the Yellowhammer Fund, which provides funding to people seeking care at any of Alabama\u2019s three abortion clinics. There are more resources for donating and supporting here, here, and here.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish EditorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletteressayRead MoreLifestyleHow I'm Talking to the Men in My Life Right NowBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
