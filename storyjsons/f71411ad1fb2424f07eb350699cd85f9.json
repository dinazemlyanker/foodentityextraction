However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Precisely one week ago my colleague, senior editor MacKenzie Chung Fegan, Slacked our entire team a link to these Party Pants from Tillamook\u2019s new Cheddar Capsule collection. There was no text attached; there didn\u2019t need to be. They\u2019re cheese-colored pants custom-designed for storing a lotta cheese. \u201c\u200b\u200bFinally, I can take cubes of cheddar from the party cheese plate back to my apartment,\u201d said senior social media manager Esra Erol, who is as smart at living as she is at dairy-heisting. (Keep an eye on her around your charcuterie.)As someone whose mother recently accused her of being anti-capitalist, \u201clike that sad protagonist in Conversations With Friends,\u201d it\u2019s rare that I see branded merch and think: Wow, cool, I love to be sold things that are designed to turn me into a walking billboard. Maybe it\u2019s their sturdy-looking ship icon or the sort of Old World font they use for their logo, but I like to think of Tillamook as the nice guys of Big Cheese. They\u2019re based in Oregon (cue the kooky Portlandia vibes). They\u2019re a farmer-owned co-op. Their cheese is genuinely very delicious.I thought about the Tillamook marketing team sitting around their boardroom table\u2014made of farmhouse wood\u2014and of one intrepid employee pitching this wild idea to their Cheese Boss. There will be insulated pockets, I imagined them saying. They will come in fresh curd yellow. They will demand a matching tasseled sweater\u2014thick-cut, like our rustic, beloved cheddar. I envisioned the young genius slowly rising out of their chair as the room burst into applause and a tear trickled down the CEO\u2019s face. I ordered a pair of the cargo pants. And then, a few days later, I Slacked this photo to my colleagues:The author feeling powerful in her cheese suit.\nOf course, they had questions. \u201cHow many pounds of cheese can you fit?\u201d asked production assistant Nico Avalle, straight to the business end of things. I thought about testing this with Babybels as the unit of measure, which seemed like a more objective\u2014independent?\u2014study. But after much discussion, it seemed unlikely that my employer would cover this expense. So I asked a Tillamook spokesperson, who confirmed: The Party Pants, which were made in collaboration with Portland Garment Factory, are purpose-built to carry three pounds of cheese. (Or about 68 Babybels.)A bunch of people wanted more information on the pockets. I am not a mathematician, but I counted nine. The largest, which is intended to fit Tillamook\u2019s one-pound block, is insulated, removable (like a fanny pack), appears to be made from poly-spandex, and promises to keep your cheese cold for up to six hours. Impressive!On the front-left leg, you\u2019ll find another removable pocket about the size of an iPhone with a cord you can slip around your wrist if you\u2019re worried about cheese pirates copping your stash. Over the left knee are three rows of two pockets each, stitched into the nylon pant leg with the same poly-blend flaps. I cannot deny, I am less confident in their insulating abilities but appreciate the effort all the same. The poly butt pocket delivers no surprises\u2014unless you sit on your cheese. A good tip from Tillamook\u2019s people: \u201cCheese should stay wrapped while in pockets to keep dogs from sniffing you out at a party.\u201dAs for the fit, I ordered a S/M and they were a little tight around the waist (I typically wear a 4 or a 6)\u2014definitely not enough room to accommodate the three pounds of cheese being harbored below the belt. The matching oversize Thick Cut Crewneck was a little scratchy at the seams but would certainly be fine if you wear an undershirt.\u201cYou look like a baby chicken,\u201d my boyfriend said as I paraded around our apartment in the full set, which was very confusing\u2014a metaphor from the wrong side of the aisle. \u201cDo you feel \u2728 flawless \u2728?\u201d asked our executive editor, Sonia Chopra. I felt powerful, like the assertive zing of sharp, aged cheddar.
