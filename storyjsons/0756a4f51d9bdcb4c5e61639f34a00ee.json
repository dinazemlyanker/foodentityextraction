Considering the obsessive attention to detail that most shops take in preparing tempura, it isn\u2019t incomprehensible that it often commands a premium. But where the sliding scale of quality for sushi is quickly apparent as you move from low to high, Tenkiyo proves that excellent tempura can still be enjoyed without draining your savings. Conveniently located in the basement below Tokyo Station, it\u2019s a destination in itself, not just a spot to refuel between train rides.ORDER THE: ten-don, all of the best parts of eating tempura placed over a single bowl of hot rice. You\u2019ll get at least two big prawns, a cut of fish, and some vegetables. Don\u2019t forget to order the extra topping of a tempura fried egg, which is one of the genre\u2019s greatest achievements. Cracking through the crispy batter to find a still-runny yolk gush out over your rice is a wild pleasure.THE VIBE IS: a calm respite from the hubbub outside. Tokyo Station is among the top ten busiest train stations in the world (Shinjuku Station on the other side of the city is first), and the flow of people never stops. But Tenkiyo is buried deep enough that it maintains a level of peace, with little pressure to finish and vacate your table. Don\u2019t miss your train, though\u2014in Tokyo, those wait for no one.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open daily from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. No reservations required. The staff does not speak English, but an English menu is available. Get off the train at the Tokyo Station stop.By Kee Byung-keunExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
