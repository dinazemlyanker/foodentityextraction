Some of them bubble in the back of your fridge.By Sophie Lucido JohnsonFebruary 13, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Sophie Lucido JohnsonFacebookTwitterEmailLet me tell you an embarrassing secret: I am a little bit in love with my sourdough starter.Illustration by Sophie Lucido JohnsonThe starter is sort of a watery dough that ferments over time and is necessary for making sourdough and other breads\u2014you have to \u201cfeed\u201d it regularly with fresh flour, which makes it begin to feel like a member of the family.The love a person has for her sourdough starter is different than the love she has for, say, an awesomely expensive salami. Sourdough has to be nurtured. You never get rid of it. It becomes something you talk about at Thanksgiving when your aunt asks you what\u2019s new in your life.Tara Jensen, author of A Baker\u2019s Year, for example, has kept the same sourdough starter for six years.\u201c[Fermented bread] is bigger than any one baker and no one can really own it. We\u2019re always trying to learn something new about bread, and yet, there\u2019s nothing new about it under the sun. It\u2019s a good metaphor for life,\u201d Jensen said.But getting into bread is intimidating. Yeast is scary. Nothing about it is logical, and so it is difficult to trust. You feed yeast a little sugar and let it sit for a while with some damp flour and suddenly you\u2019ve got a basketball-sized dough pillow on your hands. This is suspicious. How can one be sure that yeast isn\u2019t going to take off on its own in unforeseeable directions?Illustration by Sophie Lucido JohnsonI tried my hand at bagels and they came out well, so I took on the popular Jim Lahey no-knead boule recipe. I moved on to a French baguette. It was more difficult, but I managed. With each loaf I felt more confident in my yeast capacities. I decided that it was time for the holy grail: sourdough.Sourdough is, at its essence, just fermented dough. Fermentation occurs when microorganisms begin eating sugar and hanging out in your food\u2014it\u2019s the process that inevitably makes milk go sour. Sourdough is particularly exciting to me because it made up the first leavened bread, and it taught humans about yeast in the first place.Illustration by Sophie Lucido JohnsonTake a minute to let that sink in: Sourdough bread is only flour and water and air. That\u2019s it. These days we tend to add a little salt, but generally speaking, this complicated food has the simplest, earthiest origins. And what\u2019s even more amazing is that sourdough tastes and acts differently depending on the environment it\u2019s in.Jodi Wise of Sourdough International ships dehydrated samples of 17 different varieties of sourdough all over the world, from the Yukon to Giza, Egypt. She told me that when she first tried a starter from a bakery in Giza, it \u201cwent nuts. It blew up. It went all over the counter and it was so active it wasn\u2019t funny.\u201d Today, that\u2019s her favorite culture to bake with.I didn\u2019t understand any of this when I took sourdough on as a project. Without doing any more research whatsoever, I went on Amazon and ordered a cheap one from San Francisco.Illustration by Sophie Lucido JohnsonFirst, I\u2019d need to re-hydrate my starter. Then I\u2019d have to spend at least a week feeding it flour and water, preferably twice a day. I\u2019d had no idea how involved this would be.I fed it tirelessly. I was meant to look for little bubbles that would indicate it was doing all the things it was supposed to do. I saw the bubbles, but they disturbed me; the sourdough seemed to be breathing, like it was an animal.The only way to make peace with this was to decide that it sort of was an animal\u2014if one imbued with microorganisms. I named the sourdough starter Mary. Once you name something, it is difficult not to talk to it.Illustration by Sophie Lucido JohnsonIn fact, all the people I interviewed for this story compared keeping a sourdough starter to having a dog.Maurizio Leo, software-engineer-turned-baking-blogger (The Perfect Loaf), told me that he structures his life around the needs of his bread.\u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing relationship; you feed it and you observe how it reacts to the temperature or the season and the kitchen and the flour you\u2019re using, and you have to be always adjusting. There\u2019s really no hard and fast rules,\u201d Leo said.Personally, I felt like having a sourdough starter was sort of like dating. When I felt sad about something, I thought about Mary and how things between us had been growing (literally), and how soon she would do more than spiritually feed me; she would physically feed me. These are all things I also value in human partners.My first attempt at baking a loaf of bread with Mary, however, was a total failure. To this day, I\u2019m not sure where I went wrong. My guess is that I didn\u2019t knead the dough enough.Illustration by Sophie Lucido JohnsonI resolved to try again.But before I had the chance, I moved from New Orleans to Chicago and accidentally left Mary in the freezer. This was devastating. I would need to begin from scratch.In January, when it was too cold to be happy, I ordered another sourdough starter. I named this one Paul.After a few weeks of growing and feeding, I was ready for a second baking attempt. This time, I followed the instructions from an ultra-specific, two-day-long sourdough recipe I found on The Kitchn. The selling point was that the post had like 50 photographs.Illustration by Sophie Lucido JohnsonBut at the end of the two days, when I finally took my loaf out of the oven, I was flooded with understanding. This wasn\u2019t just bread. This was holy.Sourdough bread, made from your own starter and fresh from the oven, tastes so good that it makes you want to launch your own food blog, where you can wax poetic for thousands of words about it. It\u2019s crackly on the outside and soft and hot on the inside; the flavor is punchy and the texture is silky-chewy. Look: I\u2019d love to describe the experience of eating this bread in a way that would make you understand. The best I can do is to say that eating my first slice of self-made sourdough bread felt emotionally exactly like kissing my crush for the first time when I was 16.Leo (of The Perfect Loaf blog) said that the wonderful flavor is only part of it for him. \u201cThis bread has an incredible amount of flavor, but it\u2019s also good for you. I contrast this with the processed bread that you buy at the store in a bag,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t think of bread as healthy. I tell them the benefits of natural fermentation and how it breaks down and pre-digests the ingredients so your body can absorb them better.\u201dIllustration by Sophie Lucido JohnsonIt\u2019s the understanding of that one-two punch\u2014the flavor and the function\u2014that convinces you to give sourdough a try; but it\u2019s the unnamable third quality\u2014the living, breathing quality\u2014that turns sourdough bread-making from a hobby to an obsession.\u201cOn the phone, I get super fanatics,\u201d said Wise, who also runs Sourdough International\u2019s bread hotline. (Yes, that\u2019s a thing.) \u201cI talked to one guy who was traveling cross country, and he had his sourdough in the front seat of his car strapped in. I have people tell me they bought an extra fridge just for their sourdough starters,\u201d she said.Personally, I had my own brand of crazy.Illustration by Sophie Lucido JohnsonThere is no evidence that sourdough reacts to song, but I can\u2019t help but believe that in some deep recesses of its being, Paul can hear me. I want him to know how much I love him. (Beyonc\u00e9 is better at explaining love than I am.)\u201cWe are all embarrassed about confessing our love for some batter,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cBut that\u2019s what it is.\u201dI began baking all the time. My go-to recipe makes two loaves; I gave them to people to tell them I loved them. Sourdough is complicated and alive; it\u2019s fickle and mysterious; it\u2019s impossible and it\u2019s beautiful. And in the end, it\u2019s fleeting; you have to consume bread to enjoy it\u2014you can\u2019t try to hold on to it. What on earth is more like love than that?Sophie Lucido Johnson is a writer and artist in Chicago; her illustrated memoir, Many Love, will be out in June 2018.Explore Bon App\u00e9titBreadValentines DayFermentationRead MoreBA's Best BreadrestaurantsTartine Manufactory Is the Best Place to Eat Bread, Ice Cream, and Pasta at OnceBy Christine MuhlkerestaurantsThe Best Bagel We Ate in 2017By Julia KramerRecipes you want to make.
