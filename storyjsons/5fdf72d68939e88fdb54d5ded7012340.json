A great way to spice up cauliflower, and use up random pantry ingredients lying around like sliced almonds and golden raisins. Will definitely make again. AnonymousGrand Rapids, MI9/23/2019This was everything I wanted it to be and MORE. The spiced buttery almonds are so crunchy wonderful, the scallions keep the cauliflower from tasting like nothing, and the raisins add just the tiniest amount of needed sweetness. I ruined my kitchen with cauliflower particles, so I won't feel bad if I use \"riced cauliflower\" from Trader Joe's next time. alexbeggsBon App\u00e9tit 9/4/2019Absolutely delicious! We used dried apricots instead of raisins and seasoned everything with line. Loved it!AnonymousPortugal5/28/2019Holy smokes, it was so good. To the extent that my \"four servings\" rapidly became two servings as I was shoveling it out of the pan before I could plate it up. My housemates haven't forgiven me but honestly with food like this, who needs friends? AnonymousLondon, UK2/7/2019This dish is wonderfully flavorful. Had no golden raisins, so choppef a couple of medjool dates. We both loved it. Will definitely make it again and again. So good you didn't pay attention to the fact that you are eating cauliflower and not rice. IAnonymousGananoque, Ontario2/6/2019This was surprisingly flavorful! I've always felt meh about cauliflower rice but the pilaf treatment is very smart.
