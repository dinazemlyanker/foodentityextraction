Love the colours in this salad just makes me think of Spring & Summer wrapped into 1\ud83d\ude0d\nI never had radicchio before - first time and it\u2019s a great mix. \nThis will be my new dressing for 2021 \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffdAnonymousOnt. CA2/28/2021FANTASTIC. I usually modify almost every recipe I make - this was was fabulous as is.  I'm generally not a fan of radicchio or raw fennel, but the combination of all these elements (particularly with the roasted sweet potato) was a winner.  My family loved this. This salad is best eaten day of, however - I wouldn't recommend leftovers (not that you're likely to have any).  MAKE THIS, you won't regret it, such an interesting combination of flavours. Neha AggarwalNiagara, Ontario11/29/2020hooo boy does this recipe have everything I hate: confusingly sweet potatoes (but they're a savoury food???), bland cashews, soapy cilantro, and so-bitter-it-might-be-poison radicchio. HOWEVER, I had a stray fennel in the vegetable drawer, two aging sweet potatoes on the counter, and was craving a creamy nut-based dressing on a filling salad. BA, gotta hand it to ya, this recipe absolutely delivered and blew it out of the park. The bitter radicchio leaves and fennel were dashing dressed in the spicy cashew dressing and the sweet potato added a perfect amount of heft. I omitted the fish sauce in the dressing since I didn't have any and it was still perfect. I tried it with boneless short ribs the first night and with two boiled eggs the second night. I can easily see myself subbing in dry poached chicken breast but the steak was the best version. If you plan to make this ahead, make sure to roast the sweet potatoes as you need them, they don't keep very well overnight.CookSorceryBoston4/16/2020hooo boy does this recipe have everything I hate: confusingly sweet potatoes (but they're a savoury food???), bland cashews, soapy cilantro, and so-bitter-it-might-be-poison radicchio.

Loosely followed this in quarantine - dandelion greens, fennel, romaine, roasted squash, peanuts, basil.. oh and poached eggs. Dressing / seasoning I followed to a T and JIMINY CRICKETS this is delicious. It's refreshing! It's crazy crunchy! And the flavors just *sing.* this will be a staple from now on. Thank you Chef Molly \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffdAnonymousMadison, WI4/16/2020This salad was a total hit, even in mid winter in Gloucestershire. Since I do not have access to all the recommended ingredients in the west of England, I improvised. No radicchio so I used red and white chicory. Regrettably there was no cilantro so I had to skip it. I added an avocado for a little extra oomph. I made some oven pita chips to serve alongside. Terrific dinner!! AnonymousGloucestershire, England1/17/2020Impatiently waiting for sweet potatoes to finish roasting.    Been eating salad and fish.    You guys call it a salad so that still counts right?    Cashew dressing amazing BTW.    CANT WAIT TO EATAnonymousBolton Ontario 1/16/2020I have never been a salad kinda gal-- but this one changed. Me. This bad boy is hearty and I didn't feel hungry after eating it, which has never happened to anyone who has ever eaten a salad ever. Could not rec moreNatWatAustin, TX9/10/2019Ok... I took major liberties with this recipe but once I saw it I had to make it for tonight's dinner. On hand I had eggs, sweet potatoes, arugula, brussel sprouts, and some left-over Toum from Andy Baraghani's recipe (stores very well in the fridge, BTW).  I literally boiled eggs, cooked sweet potatoes, threw them on top of arugula with warm brussel sprouts and served it with Toum on the side to my family, including 'discerning' 3- and 5-year-olds.  It was un-fussy (and not exactly the recipe), but everyone loved it. And the kids ate the brussel sprouts.  Winning.AnonymousDenver, CO5/21/2019I haven't yet tried this but plan to ASAP. Is \"tearing\" eggs correct? They don't look torn in the photo.etakwisc5/20/2019This salad was great! It\u2019s kind of a production getting all of the components ready, but every ingredient really shines in the finished dish so I wouldn't skip anything. The only disappointing thing was that the leftover radicchio got soggy in the dressing, so if you\u2019re planning on leftovers (which you probably should since this makes a ton), maybe only massage the dressing into as much as you\u2019re going to eat right away.soapnanaChicago4/18/2019I modified this salad as a first course appetizer and would like to make some suggestions. It turned out not just delicious but $%^@!! DELICIOUS!! I left out the eggs and the cashews from the actual salad to make it lighter. I also used cashew butter instead of cashews for the dressing which made for a creamier texture. I also substituted sesame oil for the oil in the recipe which turned out to be a stroke of genius. Am making it again asap.AnonymousLos Angeles4/17/2019This recipe is great! I made the dressing vegan by swapping the honey for maple syrup and the fish sauce for soy and it still tasted amazing. I also used 1 can of chickpeas instead of eggs.  Easy and satisfying.  I'll definitely make it again. cassidy.haightRichmond, VA4/8/2019My friend made this for dinner and it was AMAZING! I polished off at least half the salad on my own. Definitely planning to make it again myself!\n\nI'd also love the nutrition facts for this salad if they're available!AnonymousOrange County, CA4/7/2019This salad was really good!
