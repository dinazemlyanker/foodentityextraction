RossFacebookTwitterEmailEvery Friday morning, Bon App\u00e9tit senior staff writer Alex Beggs shares weekly highlights from the BA offices, from awesome new recipes to office drama to restaurant recs, with some weird (food!) stuff she saw on the internet thrown in. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Unnecessary food feud of the weekPhoto by Marissa A. Ross\u201cThey used cheap wine because they were cheap boys.\u201d That was how Emma Wartzman recounted\u2014in film noir narration\u2014the terrible mulled wine she had on an early date at her boyfriend\u2019s apartment. Is mulled wine ever good, we wondered? \u201cSmells better than it tastes,\u201d declared Adam. \u201cTruly disgusting\u201d said Carla Lalli Music, \u201cunless you\u2019re trying to sell your house and the realtor is showing it, in which case, make a big pot.\u201d Social media manager Emily Schultz suggested boiling the mulling spices in water, perfuming your home, and drinking \u201cthe regular wine like regular wine.\u201d Whoa! \u201cThe problem is\u201d Julia Kramer typed with deep thought and analysis, \u201ceveryone here grew up in the Mid-Atlantic which is basically Florida so you do not understand what it is like to live in an actually cold climate (e.g., Chicago) where hot beverages e.g., glogg are essential to winter survival.\u201d Aliza piled on: \u201cChicago taught me that mulled wine is okay but hot toddies are FANTASTIC.\u201d Elyse Inamine and Amanda Shapiro are pro-mulled wine, but it must be said, they\u2019re very amenable, patient, and kind people. Hilary Cadigan and Jesse Sparks prefer the Hot Penicillin. What about you?Want this letter before it hits the website?

Are you going to bring a six-pack of beer and then stash the last two bottles in your backpack to take home later? Notice the wine you brought wasn\u2019t opened and therefore assume it\u2019s still in your possession? OH NO YOU\u2019RE NOT. And yet, according to multiple sources, this happens dangerously often. For more unsolicited etiquette advice (with bonus recipes), read our latest column here. And send me your questions and conundrums and general gossip! staff.bonappetit@gmail.comPhoto by Alex LauStockings full of fishOne of my favorite things about the holidays is all of the presents. So what! I need new socks! When it comes to food-themed gifts, though, things get tricky. How do you know what kitchen gadgets people already have or even want? That\u2019s why this year\u2019s most important gift guide, according to me, is this tinned fish stocking stuffer guide. Too niche, you say? Too bad! Well, you can use this highly personalized cookbook gift guide instead, actually. As long as no one in my immediate family tries to send me another olive oil infuser, we\u2019ll be good.Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensMake thisParty pork!!! With a name like that, how could you go wrong? (By under-cooking it\u2014watch out.) I had to ask the Whole Foods butcher to cut this piece of pork with the chine bone in (??? news to me) but within 10 minutes, I had my roast, five giant leeks, two bunches of kale, and three heads of garlic in the biggest tote bag I own. The pork turned out juicy and fantastic\u2014the fennel and cinnamon rub was so unexpected and great. A Molly Baz moment of genius. My whole place smelled like Christmas. Make it!Get the recipe: Party-Ready Pork RoastElsewhere, a weighted blanketWhen a weighted blanket arrived at the Healthyish desk of Aliza Abarbanel, we all got on the floor and took turns feeling the weight of the world on our bladders. I felt claustrophobic and trapped under the bean-bag-sounding thing, but Rachel Karten loved it. \u201cI want to layer two of these!\u201d she said. Read more about weighted blankets here.Dreaming of a white elephantThe Bon App\u00e9tit art department hosted a white elephant party this week and everyone paused frantic work on the February issue to attend and drink boxed wine hung from stockings, courtesy of crafty art director Christa Guerra. Designer Bryan Fountain wore a giant foil snowflake made by art assistant Annalee Soskin on his head. Editor in chief Adam Rapoport sent his assistant, Ryan Walker, with wine he was gifted at work, so in karmic return he got the mouse traps brought by Basically editor Amiel Stanek. Restaurant editor Elyse Inamine went home with a wheel of stinky cheese. Staff photographer Alex Lau brought a coveted Nicolas Cage t-shirt discovered on Amazon, which visuals editor Emma Fishman won to everyone\u2019s jealousy, and promptly turned into a crop top.
