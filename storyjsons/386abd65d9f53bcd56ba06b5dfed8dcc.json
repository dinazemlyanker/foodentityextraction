If she could only eat two flavors for the rest of her life, they\u2019d be Magpies\u2019 soft serve \u201cfried pie\u201d\u2014which she says tastes like \u201cthe most satisfying, amazing Carvel ice cream cake from my childhood\u201d\u2014and Van Leeuwen\u2019s mint chip and matcha scoops. \u201cEvery flavor, I will just go to town on,\u201d she jokes when we talk on the phone.Portman\u2019s overall food philosophy is all about balance. \u201cI really love food, and I want to take joy in it, and part of enjoying my food is also knowing that it\u2019s positive for other creatures and not harming anyone,\u201d she explains. Portman had been a vegetarian since she was nine years old, but she cut out dairy and eggs in 2009 after reading Jonathan Safran Foer\u2019s Eating Animals. Now, nine years later, she helped turn that the best-selling nonfiction book into a documentary of the same name, both producing and narrating the eye-opening film about the realities of industrial meat production and the ethics of factory farming.In addition to vegan ice creams, Natalie Portman has sussed out the best vegan alternatives for her other favorite foods. The least-cardboard-like bacon is Lightlife, though she\u2019s \u201cnot sure it tastes like actual bacon because I haven\u2019t had it in a very long time.\u201d Impossible Burgers and other products from Impossible Meat are her go-tos for cooking protein at home. To top a burger or to spread on crackers, she reaches for Kite Hill\u2019s garlic-herb spreadable nut cheese. Put them all together and you have a dream vegan bacon cheeseburger.When Portman moved from Paris back to Los Angeles a few years ago, she learned more about seasonality and now always tries to buy what\u2019s freshest. (Right now, she\u2019s glad it\u2019s finally peach season.) Trips to the farmers\u2019 market led to her and her husband Benjamin Millepied starting their own robust garden: herbs, chard, artichokes, carrots, tomatoes, peppers, lemons, avocados, figs, peaches, and even olives (which she\u2019s going to learn to brine next).The literal fruits and vegetables of their labor go into \u201cvery, very basic\u201d meals. Millepied does most of the cooking for their family of four, but Portman will make a lot of couscous, Tagines, veggie stir-fries, chilis, and other \u201cone-pot, throw-it-all-in\u201d dishes, plus the occasional hummus or tahini to \u201csatisfy the Israeli in me.\u201d The household isn\u2019t entirely vegan, though: Her husband eats meat, and they are letting their kids make their own decisions about how and what they want to eat. \u201cMy son has actually become quite an animal rights activist and is very vegetarian. He\u2019s very passionate about it, so he\u2019s on my team\u201d she says of her seven-year-old son, Aleph. But the ritual of sitting down to a family meal is the most important thing to Portman\u2014and, of course, everyone gets vegan ice cream for dessert.Explore Bon App\u00e9titVeganCelebritiesHealthyishInterviewsRead MoreLifestyleOur Favorite Ice Cream Brand Just Dropped a Dairy-Free LineBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
