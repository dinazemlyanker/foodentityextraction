Soaking the whole grains shortens the cooking time.\u00a0Reprinted With Permission From Where Cooking Begins. By Carla Lalli Music, published by Clarkson Potter, March 2019Ingredients6 servings1cup whole freekeh, soaked overnight if possibleKosher salt, freshly ground pepper1small shallot, finely chopped1small serrano chile, finely grated11\" piece ginger, peeled, finely grated\u00bdcup extra-virgin olive oil\u00bccup fresh lime juice1tsp. pure maple syrup2tsp. sumac, plus more for serving2pomegranates1big bunch parsley, leaves and tender stems very coarsely chopped (about 1\u00bd cups)1small fennel bulb, fronds torn, bulb and stalks thinly slicedHandful of mint leaves, torn if largeFlaky sea saltIngredient InfoSumac can be found at Middle Eastern markets, specialty food stores, and online.PreparationStep 1Cook freekeh in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente, 20\u201330 minutes. Drain and spread out on a rimmed baking sheet; season with kosher salt and pepper while still warm. Let cool.Step 2Meanwhile, whisk together shallot, chile, ginger, oil, lime juice, maple syrup, and 2 tsp. sumac. Taste dressing and season with kosher salt. Let sit 10 minutes.Step 3Cut pomegranates in half. Working over a large bowl, hold a pomegranate half cut side down in your palm with your fingers stretched wide. Use a wooden spoon to forcefully and repeatedly smack pomegranate skin, which will send the seeds raining down into the bowl. Repeat with remaining pomegranate. Fill bowl with cold water to cover seeds. Skim off any little bits of pith that float to the surface; drain seeds and shake off excess liquid.Step 4Toss parsley, fennel, fennel fronds, and mint in a large bowl. Add freekeh, season with kosher salt, and toss gently to combine. Add dressing and toss with your hands to thoroughly coat ingredients. Add pomegranate seeds and toss gently to disperse. Sprinkle with sea salt and more sumac.Step 5Do Ahead: Freekeh can be cooked 3 days ahead.

Slightly sweet and tart, the more herbs the better!Seattle,WA7/30/2020LOVED this!  I would like to know what could be substituted for pomegranates if they are not available?\n AnonymousCA12/3/2019Delicious! \nI hate to be that person, but I didn't follow the recipe closely because I didn't have the ingredients. I cooked 1 cup dried barley instead of freekeh and used diced orange slices instead of pomegranate seeds. Turned out delicious and a great dressing. Loved the use of herbs. \nAnonymousOakland3/20/2019This was a super pleasant reprieve from the staleness of winter.
