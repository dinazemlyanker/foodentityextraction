There is an overlay over Step 1 and 2. Some people do print recipes. Is that something to criticize? It's not a big deal but BA probably could do better. Enough said.Janet3/15/2022Its's 2022 who is still printing recipes?? Anonymous3/8/2022and I learned nothing because there is nothing but arguments about how to print the recipe.  what about the icons on the left-hand side of the screen?  these comments are ridiculous!  did anyone actually make the recipe?  what is your actual opinion except for whining about the print function?  mmca8West Texas 3/8/2022I  agree with Jason. I have written several times about the inability to print a recipe. And taking a 'screen shot' is not the answer. I too will not renew my subscription for this reason\n\nSurely you have a technical staff capable of fixing this problem. Or do you read the comments?\n\nUsing the print icon on the left, one of the advertisements overlays the first para of the recipe.\n\nShame on you bon appetit. You can do better.AnonymousAlexandria, VA3/8/2022Hatch Brand Green Chiles is the Go-To.AnonymousChicago, IL3/8/2022Why don\u2019t  all who desire a printable format take a screen shot on your computer and print???Alexis RoseMiami,Fl3/8/2022Really, really good.  Surprised with the heat, we'll have to use less fresh chile next time (you never know when you'll accidentally get a hot one).Anonymous3/3/2022This was ok, but after following the recipe exactly, I'd charge the green chili. I used the organic Luna brand whole foods carries - it just has so little flavor. Unless you know of a great canned brand, just roast your own anaheims and chop them up in its place. That would give some nice green chili flavor. I avoid conventionally grown peppers of all kind - they're a heavy pesticide crop. James RManhattan Beach2/20/2022What is recommended for canned \"diced green chiles\"? Jalapenos?Allison2/20/2022Janet, don't give up! either use the print tool on the left but WAIT for the system to load, OR (on a Mac) just press COMMAND-P, and you can print or create a pdf. RichardHermosa Beach, CA2/17/2022I am able to print these recipes using the tool on the left.JanetLaramie, WY2/17/2022Honestly this is my complaint about every single recipe bon appetit had to offer... You literally NEVER give printable recipes. I will not renew my subscription because of this. I HATE trying to use my phone or tablet so I can fix a recipe. Not giving a printable format is just dumb. This can't be about intellectual property rights because you know I could write it down or type it out and reproduce it. This is just refusing to accept reality.\n\nI love bon appetit but I will not be renewing my subscription and I'm more than happy to savage the publication on Twitter. This is as dumb as Donald Trump's wall.\n\nThanks for saving me another years subscription cost.
