They can also be dangerously limiting\u2014depending on who\u2019s doing the telling.By Amanda ShapiroMay 30, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailIllustrations by George WylesolFacebookTwitterEmailFrom Queer Eye to Britney Spears, we\u2019re a culture consumed by stories of transformation. We want to hear about the fuck ups, the rock bottoms, the come-to-Jesus moments, the clawing out. We want to see who these people were before and who they become on the other side, and their lives become roadmaps for how we might handle our own flaws and shames.Those of us in food media understand this appeal as much as anyone, and the restaurant industry has given us plenty to work with. These days, I\u2019m seeing male-chef redemption stories everywhere; I get as many PR emails tossing me tales of reformed bad-boy chefs as I do about turmeric. On Healthyish and Bon App\u00e9tit, we\u2019ve run a handful of accounts of transformation, or at least self-improvement, from chefs like Naomi Pomeroy, Missy Robbins, Gabe Rucker, Sean Brock, and Andrew Zimmern. Most of these articles were written from the chefs\u2019 perspectives, and that was an intentional choice. As an editor, I\u2019ve always felt that the best way to tell a transformation story is in the words of the person who has transformed. These posts all got a lot of eyeballs and, more importantly, a lot of responses from readers telling us how much they could relate.But I\u2019ve come to understand that there\u2019s a pretty big problem with these personal narratives, which is that they are, by definition, one-sided. We know who\u2019s telling the story. But we don\u2019t stop enough to ask who, by extension, isn\u2019t being heard.In February, we ran a first-person story by David McMillan, one of the chef-owners of Joe Beef in Montreal. It detailed McMillan\u2019s hedonistic descent into alcoholism and his long journey toward sobriety, and the reader response was overwhelming. Half a million people read the article, and chefs like Zimmern and Brock shared it on Twitter with gusto. McMillan is frank about the self-imposed hell he lived in, but the focus of the piece is not on how his addiction affected the people he worked with; it\u2019s on the positive impact his newfound sobriety has had across his restaurants.I\u2019ve come to understand that there\u2019s a pretty big problem with these personal narratives, which is that they are, by definition, one-sided.Last week, The New Yorker ran a reported article about McMillan and his business partner, Fred Morin, that details the same trajectory from wine-swilling party hosts to sober, serious restaurant owners. The writer Hannah Goldfield interviews employees past and present who described all kinds of unprofessional behavior at his restaurants, from groping to ass-grabbing to general bullying.Some of these incidents involved McMillan and some didn\u2019t, but that\u2019s mostly besides the point. Whomever the offender, McMillan\u2019s employees weren\u2019t able to come to him for help, because as McMillan himself acknowledges, \u201cI was stuck drinking somewhere.\u201dPersonal narratives can be powerful, but they can also be dangerously limiting depending on who\u2019s doing the telling. Addiction and abuse don\u2019t affect the user in a vacuum; they\u2019re shrapnel that hits whomever is in range. And when we let the bomb-thrower shape the narrative, we\u2019re ignoring the people left in his wake. What story would\u2019ve emerged if, instead of giving the platform to the repentant chef, we gave it to his former employees? How would they characterize their experience at Joe Beef before and after McMillan\u2019s sobriety? I wish I knew.Even reported articles don\u2019t always paint a complete picture. In September, Healthyish ran a piece about five well-respected chefs who\u2019d all become sober and were hosting a non-alcoholic dinner at Feast, the Portland food festival. I remember cutting a section that went into why all the participants were men, and I didn't push the writer to question the chefs\u2019 motives or bring in any critical voices. At the time, it seemed besides the point. But those additions would\u2019ve made the piece more honest, nuanced, and timely.It\u2019s curious that these redemption narratives have become so prevalent on the heels of the #metoo movement. For a time it seemed that our obsession had shifted from transformation tales to holding men accountable for their shitty behavior. It seemed that, when it came to sexual harassment, nobody wanted a transformation story. We just wanted the offender to go away.The workplace culture that encourages excessive drinking and drug use is the same culture that breeds sexual harassmentI think we\u2019re attracted to stories like McMillan\u2019s now because we want to believe that they\u2019re not about sexual harassment or abuse. We want to believe that there are \u201cgood\u201d male chefs who maybe drank a little too much but then straightened themselves out and made amends. I think we're gravitating to these stories out of some collective desire for catharsis amid so much terrible news.But the reality is that the workplace culture that encourages excessive drinking and drug use is the same culture that breeds sexual harassment. It\u2019s irresponsible to talk about the former without acknowledging the latter, and it\u2019s equally irresponsible to narrow our perspective to a single \u201chero\u201d the way these redemption stories often do.It would be naive to argue that we can break our cultural addiction to the redemption narrative. It is, after all, one of the oldest stories we have, from Odysseus to the Prodigal Son to Ebenezer Scrooge. This story will never stop compelling us, but it\u2019s crucial to acknowledge that there\u2019s something blinding about its power. Only once we acknowledge this will we start to see beyond it, to consider what other arcs and other voices might tell us about how people err, who they harm, and how not just one person but all of us can heal.Explore Bon App\u00e9titFirst PersonChefsRecipes you want to make.
