That way I never forget a bottle opener, a tiny container of salt, or my designated Negroni Nalgene. Cooking while camping can be minimalist\u2014bring a bucket of Popeyes, call it a day\u2014or maximalist (once we slow-grilled a lamb shoulder?!?!!? Kind of amazed we didn\u2019t attract a bear). Either way you\u2019re going to need some eating and cooking gear. Here\u2019s what you need to get started.Camp stoveYou could cook everything over the fire, but sometimes coffee can\u2019t wait for the kindling to catch. Eureka\u2019s camp stove is lightweight, adorable, classic.Ignite Camp Stove$110 at Eureka$115 at AmazonFoldable grillMy favorite way to cook while camping is on this foldable grill by Breeo that can adjust up and down. We slow-roasted the aforementioned lamb on it, ate chicken wings right off it, and percolated coffee on it.Breeo Outpost 19 Grill With Bag$140 at BreeoNesting potsAt most you\u2019ll need a pot (to boil water, this one has a built-in strainer) and a pan (scrambled eggs, pancakes), and these nest into each other nicely.\u00a0Escape Pot + Frypan$80 at ZolaThe everything mugOne insulated tumbler does it all. Wipe it out after each use\u2014you won\u2019t have to worry about your wine tasting like Honey Bunches of Oats.YETI Rambler 10-Ounce Wine Tumbler$25 at YETIThe Negroni NalgeneBring the Nalgene that best fits your personality, but look, this one glows in the dark!Jessica LimPARKS Glow in the Dark Water Bottle$20 at Parks ProjectPlatewareSplatter enamelware is classic; can\u2019t go wrong.GSI Outdoors Pioneer Table Set$70 at Amazon$70 $56 at MoosejawLong tongsFor cooking and moving logs around. Necessary.\u00a016\" Heavy Duty Stainless Steel Utility Tongs$6 at AmazonCollapsible side tableIf all you want to eat while camping is a cheese plate and a good baguette\u2014not a bad way to do it\u2014you\u2019ll still need a side table (or a convenient tree stump). This tie-dye one is super lightweight, packs into a tiny bag, and stretches taut to safely hold your drink. Don\u2019t sit on it.\u00a0Helinox Table One Camping Table$140 at Backcountry$140 at MoosejawRefillable water jugIf your campsite doesn\u2019t have drinking water, bring a big refillable container like Reliance\u2019s 7-gallon Jumbo-Tainer. It should last four people a long weekend in the woods and you can always refill it at a rest stop. It has a handy handle and spout and its flat shape will fit easily under your car seat.Reliance 7-Gallon Jumbo-Tainer Water Container$32 at Target$26 at WalmartHard coolerDoubles as a side table or extra seat if you need it. Do I even need to mention a brand here? You have one already. If not: YETI or bust.PHOTO BY TED CAVANAUGHYETI Tundra 35 Hard Cooler$600 at Amazon$250 at BackcountryCoffee, coffee, coffeeYou\u2019ve just slept on hard ground and you need coffee as quickly as possible. Instead of lugging a French press or percolator into the woods, bring cold brew concentrate or, for a crowd, La Colombe\u2019s cold brew box. Water it down and heat it over the stove, or drink it on ice. Trying to pack lighter? Alpine Start's Instant Coffee does the trick.Cold Brew on Tap Fridge Pack$34 at La ColombeWineBig-batch cocktails are a good idea. So is filling an XL insulated thermos with designated cocktail ice. Boxed wine is getting better and better, and the best place to drink it is in the woods, when you don\u2019t want to be weighed down with glass bottles. A 3L box of Herisson Vin Rouge is the equivalent of four bottles and it\u2019s a bright, acidic Gamay blend that pairs well with unwashed hair and howls in the night.Herisson Vin Rouge 3L Box$35 at Dandelion Wine Shop$35 at Fresh DirectDish stuffThis collapsible sink is game-changing. You can use it to haul kindling too. Bring an old kitchen sponge, Dr. Bronner\u2019s (it\u2019s biodegradable), and a ratty old towel to dry with. Also remember you don\u2019t really have to wash everything. A rinse and a wipe will do the trick. You\u2019re in the woods!UST FlexWare Collapsible Sink$26 at Amazon$20 at TargetHeavy-duty aluminum foilYou don\u2019t even need plates if you make foil packets in the fire for dinner. But bring the heavy-duty foil, not the normal stuff, so it\u2019ll hold up without risk of tearing.Heavy-Duty Aluminum Foil$10 at Target$10 at AmazonThe kitchen Dopp kit\u00a0Fill this bag with the small guys: a few beat-up steak knives and one decent chef\u2019s knife; a cheap plastic cutting board from T.J. Maxx; matches!!!; garage sale cutlery, Nalgene minis \u2014they never leak\u2014filled with olive oil, vinegar, soy sauce; a multi-tool you\u2019ll use constantly; and a 1-oz. container with flaky salt or your favorite spice mix.Cooking Kit Bag$80 at Blue Ridge Overland GearExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingCampingRecipes you want to make.
