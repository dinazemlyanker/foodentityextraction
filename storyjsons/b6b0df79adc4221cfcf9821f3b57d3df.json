Feel free to substitute the zucchini here with seasonal vegetables like broccolini or mixed mushrooms. Keep the beer batter on ice and don\u2019t overcrowd the pan while frying to get the crispiest vegetables. Store-bought chili oil (Avila recommends the one from Only Pans L.A.) is a great replacement for the salsa macha and adds the right amount of spice.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.
