Lay the fish horizontally across the grill grate with the top fins toward you and cook. When it\u2019s time to turn, wedge two metal spatulas under the fish\u2014one near the tail and the other at the head\u2014then quickly and confidently roll it away from you onto its other side in one fluid motion.Ingredients4 servings15-lb. or two 2\u00bd-lb. head-on whole fish (such as red snapper or black sea bass), cleanedKosher salt\u2153cup chaat masala, vadouvan, or tandoori spice\u2153cup vegetable oil, plus more for grill1ripe but firm mango, peeled, cut into irregular 1\u00bd\" pieces1small red onion, thinly sliced, rinsed1bunch cilantro, coarsely chopped (leaves and stems)3Tbsp. fresh lime juiceExtra-virgin olive oil (for drizzling)Lime wedges (for serving)PreparationStep 1Place fish on a cutting board and pat dry thoroughly with paper towels. With a sharp knife, make slashes crosswise on a diagonal along the body every 2\" on both sides, cutting all the way down to the bones. Season fish generously inside and out with salt. Coat fish with spice mix, packing on more if needed (it should cover the entire fish, head to tail). Let sit at room temperature 20 minutes.Step 2Meanwhile, prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Clean and oil grate.Step 3Drizzle both sides of fish with remaining \u2153 cup vegetable oil to coat. Grill fish undisturbed, 10 minutes. Lift up slightly from one edge to see if skin is puffed and lightly charred and easily releases from grate. If not quite ready, leave alone for another minute or so and try again. Once it is ready, gently slide 2 large metal spatulas underneath and turn over.Illustration by Joe WilsonStep 4Grill fish until the other side is lightly charred and skin is puffed, 8\u201312 minutes, depending on the size of the fish.
