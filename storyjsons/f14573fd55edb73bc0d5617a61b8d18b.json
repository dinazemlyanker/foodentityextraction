Toast pistachios on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown, 5\u20138 minutes. Let cool, then finely chop. Reduce oven temperature to 325\u00b0.Step 2Slice about \u00bd\" off the top of each tomato; reserve tops. Using a spoon, scoop out the center of each tomato (save for making sauce). Season insides of tomatoes with salt and pepper. Transfer to a baking dish large enough to hold tomatoes (they can be snug).Step 3Mix pistachios, garlic, raisins, \u00bc cup oil, and 1 Tbsp. thyme in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper. Place about 1 Tbsp. filling in each tomato. Tear mozzarella into bite-size pieces and snuggle into tomatoes. Top with remaining filling (you may need to gently press filling down with your fingers).Step 4Replace tomato tops; drizzle with oil. Scatter thyme sprigs over and bake, uncovered, until tomatoes release some liquid and begin to get a little wrinkly on top, 35\u201345 minutes. Let cool slightly before serving.How would you rate Cheesy Stuffed Tomatoes?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (1)Back to TopTriangleSurprised this hasn't  been reviewed yet. I have made this 3 times so far since receiving my August issue. The first time was a learning experience, as the large heirloom tomatoes released far too much liquid and were swimming. We decided they were overripe and that I should have removed more of the flesh, i.e. not just \"the center\", but enough to create a large enough void to hold all the cheese and pistachio goodness easily. I left about 1/3 inch shell of the tomato, and also drained them for a minute upside down to release the extra liquid. Other than that followed the recipe, and watched carefully and removed from the oven as soon as a very small amount of liquid escaped in the pyrex pan I baked them in. Leave for only a few minutes before serving. For cheese I have tried fresh mozzarella, and a combination of fresh mozzarella and mild provolone. This is a wonderful, generous side to a grilled chicken breast or the like, and a beautiful presentation.valerie_joyVictoria, BC, Canada8/13/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titTomatoVegetableMozzarellaCheeseRicottaGoat CheeseFetaEasyWeeknight MealsSideStarterGluten-FreeVegetarianHealthyishDinnerRecipes you want to make.
