It also comes together entirely in a food processor, containing the mess (and making these kid-friendly\u2014we bet yours will be interested in pressing PULSE). Use gel food dye here if you can find it\u2014it achieves the most vibrant color with just a drop or two.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Add butter and pulse until mixture looks sandy and holds together when you squeeze some between your fingers. Add egg and vanilla and pulse just until dough comes together in a large clump (do not overmix). Turn out dough onto a surface and divide into 2 pieces. Form each into a 1\u201d-thick disk and wrap in plastic. Chill at least 2 hours.Step 2Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0. Roll out 1 dough disk on a well-floured surface to \u00bc\u201d thick (keep remaining dough in fridge until ready to use). Punch out shapes with cutters dipped in flour and divide cookies between 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing about 1\u201d apart (use a thin spatula to transfer if needed). Gather together any dough scraps, wrap in plastic, and chill 15 minutes.Step 3Meanwhile, bake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and front to back halfway through, until lightly golden around the edges (cookies should be soft; they will firm up once cool), 10\u201312 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets, then transfer to a wire rack. Repeat process with scraps and remaining disk of dough.Step 4Whisk powdered sugar and milk in a shallow bowl until smooth (icing should be about the consistency of heavy cream). Working one at a time, hold edges of cookies and dip top sides into icing to fully coat. Place on a wire rack set inside a baking sheet.Step 5Pour half of remaining icing into a small bowl. Color each half of icing with a different color, stirring to combine. Using the end of a spoon or a fork, spatter cookies with colored icing. Let sit until icing is set, at least 2 hours.\u00a0Do ahead: Dough can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled or freeze up to 1 month ahead. Cookies can be decorated 5 days ahead.

I don't see how \"spattering\" with a fork or spoon would create such straight lines.AnonymousPA1/13/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titDessertEasyNut-FreeBakingCookieChristmasRecipes you want to make.
