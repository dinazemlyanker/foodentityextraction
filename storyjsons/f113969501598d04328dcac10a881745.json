We\u2019d grab sun-dried coconuts that had fallen from the trees, remove the husks, and crack the nut open. Then we\u2019d grate the pulp with a hole-punched piece of metal, mixing with water, squeezing, and straining it to make coconut milk. These days, I rely on the canned stuff (Native Forest for aroma and consistency and Trader Joe\u2019s for its concentrated coconut flavor) to make this Caribbean-style curry with a mix of vegetables: zucchini, carrots, cauliflower, eggplant, okra, mushrooms. It\u2019s got a brilliant yellow hue from grated fresh turmeric (or ground turmeric in a pinch), an assertive curry flavor (look for Chief or Lalah's brands), and a little heat. But if the music is playing a bit too loud and you want to turn it down, that\u2019s what coconut milk does. It balances out sharp, intense, or spicy flavors. \u2014Rawlston WilliamsAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.
