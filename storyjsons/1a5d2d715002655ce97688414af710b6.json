Drizzled lemon juice over top with olive oil, then topped with cilantro!AnonymousSomers, NY8/25/2021YUM! Delicious as written and it came together in no time! Perfect for a weeknight. Riffable too, I can already see this as a rice bowl, salad, wrap...\nNext time though I'd double the squash. Also, I don't see why wiping out the pot in between is necessary? I saut\u00e9ed my squash in the rendered fat / fond and it was to die for! Now that I think of it, the wiping may be to keep the squash vegetarian... At any rate, I used beef and will try the lamb next time! \nAlso, definitely top with labneh and sumac for utter culinary bliss!!SARosslyn, VA8/23/2021Excellent recipe, I would use ground leg chicken meat for the topping.\nAnonymousToronto Ontario.Canada7/20/2021Made exactly as written. Tasty, but a bit texturally monotone. It would benefit from some acid. I might try it again with a quick pickle, kimchi, or thinly sliced fennel and lemon juice. Salt levels in the recipe were fine as written. Nick TedescoNew York, NY5/10/2021This is one of my all time faves! I make this alll the dang time. It\u2019s so good. I cut it in half to make it for 2 people. I don\u2019t find it overly salty but I may cut down on the salt in the hummus. faithbCalifornia 8/12/2020Delicious!! I\u2019ve made this twice already with ground lamb. I bought hummus from the grocery store. Also, used WAY less salt.AnonymousVienna, VA3/22/2020Absolutely delish! I halved the amount of salt for the lamb as I thought I could add more seasoning later if need be - didn't need it! Will definitely make this again. angelwhe12/5/2019Super tasty! This would be a great party snack! I actually made it with Beyond Meat Crumbles (we like to mix it up) & it totally worked. Can\u2019t wait to try it with lamb or beef!chilliwilli123Los Angeles9/1/2019This was out of this world!!!  I never prepare the same thing two days in a row for dinner because I love to try new recipes, my husband raved so much about this dish I made two days later and its delicious cold too!! If your having a party or just inviting a few friends over for cocktails serve this as an appetizer along with pita chips, I made mine from flat bread I bought from the cooler section in the grocery store......where the pie crusts and pizza dough is located.  Follow the directions on the package and before you bake sprinkle with sea salt, fresh cracked pepper and oregano {I had fresh but you can use dried too) YUMMMMMMM!!!!!!bella1946Michigan8/29/2019This was delicious! Doubled the meat and seasoning, and it came out perfect. So did the squash. Used store-bought hummus. Served with a crumble of feta. Quick, easy, inexpensive and tasty. Will definitely make again.New York8/28/20193 and 1/4 teaspoons of salt for four servings. \n\nI suspect the \"anonymous\" reviewers are staff paid by Bon Appetit to review. The 5-star reviews and their \"alterations\" are always similar.AnonymousZanzibar8/27/2019Horrible. Insanely salty, and before you comment, yes I used Kosher salt. All I could taste was the salt.alaheyCalifornia8/27/2019This recipe was delicious.  I cut it in half and used a 1/4 of the amount of cumin recommended.  My husband is a deer hunter so the lamb was actually ground venison (all lab dishes in our house are made with venison).  So good.  I grilled pitas and sour dough bread.  It was yummyAnonymous8/25/2019I love the use of hummus here, and the thick cut squash as well. It was all delicious, and really quick to put together. I made a few modifications- I\u2019m pescatarian, so I subbed out lamb for a salmon filet rubbed with the seasoning and roasted in butter. Also used pre-made garlic hummus, BUT it was from the farmers market so I feel like I get bonus points. Thanks for putting this up!AnonymousLos Angeles8/19/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titDipHummusMiddle EasternChickpeaBeanVegetableSummer SquashSquashGround BeefBeefMeatGround LambLambSummerQuickEasyWeeknight MealsMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeHealthyishSaut\u00e9DinnerRecipes you want to make.
