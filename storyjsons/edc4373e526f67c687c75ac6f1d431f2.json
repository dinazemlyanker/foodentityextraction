It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.The days, our lives, are getting shorterDid you enjoy that bonus hour of sleep on Sunday? Or did you, like Carla Lalli Music\u2019s son Cosmo, wake up at 5 a.m. on Monday, boldly open a pomegranate, and end up smearing pomegranate juice all over the fridge door, kitchen counter, and your PJ pants before wondering where everybody was? Sweet, sweet Cosmo. Kid can open a pomegranate though.Now he just learns how to make: Andy Baraghani\u2019s Pomegranate-Glazed Chicken with Buttery Pine NutsWhat else is good to cook when it\u2019s dark at 4 p.m.: These 6 wintry stewsWant this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Football catIs all of us when the mashed potatoes on Thanksgiving are ready. The football cat has nothing to do with food but it was obviously the best news story of the week. Here\u2019s a BA connection: our features editor Meryl Rothstein was at the game!! She cheered the kitty as he sped his way to the end zone. My colleagues told me the cat looked like \u201cfat Roger\u201d (I have a black cat named Roger), which was heartwarming. I hope he got a bowl full of tuna after that sprint.Photo by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Sue LiHow the tempeh crumblesAmanda Shapiro made this vegetarian recipe for tempeh that\u2019s crumbled and browned, and served with a peanut/soy/lime/honey/sambal dressing on noodles. \u201cTempeh kinda sucks,\u201d she said, \u201cit tastes weird and ferment-y and bitter. But I\u2019m reeaalllly trying to cook less meat for, you know, the planet and also my budget. This was the first tempeh I ever liked. The dressing carries the flavor, and suddenly it doesn\u2019t taste like tempeh at all.\u201d Aliza Abarbanel popped into the conversation: \u201cI make these weekly.\u201d Christina Chaey turned around, \u201cSO GOOD.\u201d So that\u2019s a triple endorsement!Try it and see: Peanutty Noodles with Tempeh CrumblesWow how niceThe wonderful and hilarious Bobby Finger wrote about his love for the BA YouTube channel this week at Jezebel. I like what he says about how we think of anything unrelated to politics as a guilty pleasure/escape from those horrors: \u201cThat crippling badness should not wholly negate its opposing force. There are good things everywhere, scattered throughout the otherwise barren and apocalyptic landscape like unsown seeds.\u201d It applies to Claire Safftiz making Takis, definitely, as well as so much other goodness right now...like football cat.Read it: My Obsession With the Bon App\u00e9tit Cinematic UniversePhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensIt was a rough dayWhen Christina Chaey and Claire Saffitz, at the end of a long day of filming their episode of Making Perfect: Thanksgiving, realized the brussels sprout recipe they\u2019d come up with already existed. It was Molly Baz\u2019s glazed sprouts from last year, a recipe that changed my life. (It never occurred to me to preheat the baking sheet, which makes the sprout halves brown and crisp up FAST.) Anyway, Chaey and Claire were in near-tears. I stood there, useless. But the sprouts they ended up developing have this amazing brown butter, pistachio, and lime dressing. Both recipes are great! Make them and report back with your notes.The recipes: Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Warm Honey Glaze and Brussels Sprouts With Pistachios and LimeMust readI am obsessed with grocery stores and it\u2019s very upsetting to me to read about how dollar stores are taking over, causing local groceries to close. Dollar stores don\u2019t sell produce! They sell Queen Helene\u2019s famous mint julep face mask, giant cans of Campbell\u2019s soup, and the myth of a good deal.Read it: Farm Country Feeds America. But Just Try Buying Groceries There.Find your natty lightWe had a funny meeting this week about taking better personal food photos to be regrammed by the Bon App\u00e9tit Instagram account. Social media editor Emily Schultz brought a plate of fried eggs to demonstrate with. This applies to you too, readers, who make recipes and tag us! We\u2019ll regram ya! I will share my notes with you here:VERTICAL ONLY, NO SQUARESFIND YOUR NATTY LIGHT (I think Schultz means natural light, not...the beer)TAKE ON A NEUTRAL OR CONSISTENT BACKGROUNDFOOD MUST LOOK IRRESISTIBLE (a nice photo I had of a salad was rejected for being a salad)SANDWICHES NEVER LOOK GOOD FROM THE TOP, SHOW US THE SIDEEVERYTHING ELSE BETTER BE TAKEN FROM THE TOP THOSOMETIMES THERE\u2019S TOO MUCH PIZZAUnnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekWhile demonstrating how to make Basically\u2019s spinach and feta tarte soleil on Instagram this week (see DM replies above), Sarah Jampel revealed she was saving her squeezed-out spinach water...to drink. It\u2019s spinach tea! \u201cIt tastes surprisingly salty even though there\u2019s no salt,\u201d she told us. \u201cIt\u2019s a well-seasoned, vegetal broth. You could use it as a base for garlic broth and it\u2019d be delicious!\u201d \u201cOkay, she\u2019s convincing me,\u201d admitted a skeptical Emily Schultz. \u201cThis is upsetting,\u201d said Carla Lalli Music. \u201cI drink spinach water. I drink spinach water with pride,\u201d said ally Sohla El-Waylly. \u201cThawed spinach water? No,\u201d said Andy Baraghani, who continued: \u201cJuiced celery and spinach with just a drop of pickled Thai chile vinegar, some lemon, yes!\u201d Right. Jampel wasn\u2019t giving up: \u201cYou know when you deglaze a pan with wine and then pour yourself a glass?
