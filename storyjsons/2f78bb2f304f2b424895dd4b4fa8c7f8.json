This easy ricotta dip makes eating your veggies a pleasure, not a chore.By Emily SchultzFebruary 21, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsea KyleFacebookTwitterEmailThe only thing better than a good recipe? When something's so easy to make that you don't even need one. Welcome to It's That Simple, a column where our staffers talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks that they can make with their eyes closed.I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019m getting older and wiser about my snacking or because the Healthyish Lifestyle has sucked me in, but I! Love! Crudit\u00e9s! And I want it at every single dinner party from now until the end of time. Because there will always inevitably be wine. And olives. And bread with olive oil. And maybe some salty, thinly-sliced meat products. And that's all coming before dinner is served. So I need to offset all that heavy business with some vegetables. Enter: 5-minute herby ricotta dip.Let's be real: Dip is what makes crudit\u00e9s worth eating. A vegetable is a vegetable is a vegetable; a vegetable dunked in tangy, herby cheese is another thing entirely. __And this dip is fancy-feeling enough that it can be built into your well-thought-out dinner party but simple enough that you can throw it together at a moment's notice. (You know, for all those times when the party shows up at your place and you haven\u2019t had time to properly grocery shop.) Did I mention that it pretty much all happens in your blender? Yeah. Here's how it comes together.Start with the diary. You\u2019re going to dump a half cup of ricotta and a quarter cup of yogurt into your blender. I like using full-fat plain yogurt (not Greek!) because it has a looser consistency and Greek yogurt has a tendency to make the mixture seize up in the blender. (If all you've got is the thick Greek stuff, all is not lost\u2014you might just need to add a splash or two of water to loosen things up before blending.) Then, add a couple of glugs of extra virgin olive oil, a clove of grated garlic and salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste. If you don\u2019t have yogurt, feel free to use sour cream, or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche if for some reason you're the kind of person who just has cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche lying around. The world is your (dairy) oyster! The world is your...cow? Yeah, that works better.Then it's time to add herbs. You can use whatever kind of tender herbs you like or have wilting in your crisper. (Tender herbs are things like basil, dill, cilantro, and parsley\u2014not the tough, stem-y ones like oregano, thyme, and rosemary, which are too strong for this dip.) The two that I without fail have in my fridge are basil and cilantro, so that\u2019s what I gravitate towards. I like grabbing an equal handful of each and giving them a rough chop or tear before throwing them into the blender, tender stems and all\u2014it\u2019ll get blended together in the end. The ratio of herbs to cheese is totally up to you. Buzz it all up, taste for seasoning, and that's pretty much it, folks!The more herbs, the better.\nNow, to plate it all. The crudit\u00e9s platter is really your chance to shine when it comes to being incredibly extra with food styling\u2014I love to go all out. It\u2019s my version of New York Fashion Week. I\u2019ll scoop the dip into a little bowl, drizzle another glug of olive oil onto my perfect swoosh (done with the back of a spoon!) and then sprinkle on some Aleppo-style pepper flakes and flaky sea salt. You could get really crazy and throw on some pepitas or toasted sesame seeds for added texture. And as for veggies? I love cutting up multi-colored carrots, pink and green endive for a little hand salad action, and slicing some Persian cucumbers into spears. Arrange the veggies around the dip like they fell casually from the sky, and you've got the kind of semi-virtuous snack platter that Instagram dreams are made of.See that?! Food can be healthy AND beautiful!More! Dip! Please!Slow-Roasted Onion DipLike the one you make with the packet of soup mix, but with no weird chemicals and 1,000 percent tastier.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimpleRicottaDipherbBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
