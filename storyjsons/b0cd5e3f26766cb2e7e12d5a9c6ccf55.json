Here, two volunteers look back on the experience, and ahead to the future.By Priya KrishnaMarch 24, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto courtesy of BASTAFacebookTwitterEmailIn February a winter storm blew through Texas, leaving over a million people without heat or water. Suddenly, people couldn\u2019t cook. They didn\u2019t have water to drink. And because the roads were snowed over, they couldn\u2019t even go to the supermarket. With the pandemic layered on top of this, the situation became a full-blown humanitarian crisis.In the absence of robust government assistance, much of the work to help struggling communities fell to local organizations, like the Workers Defense Project and Building and Strengthening Tenant Action (BASTA). Neither of them typically do food distribution; the Workers Defense Project advocates for the rights of low-wage and immigrant workers. BASTA focuses on helping renters in Austin get affordable, safe housing. Yet together these organizations mobilized hundreds of volunteers to bring hot meals and water to those around Texas that needed it most, working with Good Work Austin\u2019s community kitchen program and World Central Kitchen to source food from local restaurants. They created distribution centers in parking lots and dropped off meals to those who couldn\u2019t get out of their homes.We spoke with two volunteers for these efforts in Austin\u2014Ana Isabel Garcia, a house cleaner, and Carolina Isabel Antonio, her 14-year-old daughter. The two found themselves without water in the early days of the storm and received hot meals through BASTA and the Workers Defense Project. They decided it was important to pay that kindness forward by joining BASTA and the Workers Defense Project\u2019s efforts, and help those who were still in need. They told us what the situation was like on the ground, and why aid remains critically important, even a month after the storm.How did you find out about the Workers Defense Project and BASTA?Ana Isabel Garcia: I found out about the organization from Facebook. They helped us a lot during the storm with food and water.Carolina Isabel Antonio: The only thing we lost during the storm was water. That was a really stressful thing because that is how my mom cooks and cleans vegetables. So we got cooked food and water [from WDP and BASTA] and we were really grateful. It was our turn to help other people.What was it like during the storm where you all live?CIA: Everybody lost water for almost a whole week. People were stressed out because they couldn\u2019t go to the restroom or cook. What we started doing was getting water from the pool. Someone opened the gate and all the people that live in our apartment complex went to grab water with buckets and pots. The other thing was the snow on the roads. People couldn\u2019t get out to get food because there was a lot of snow. So we grabbed shovels and started clearing snow so that people could go to the store.Why did it feel particularly urgent for you all to go out and help?CIA: A lot of people needed water. Their lights went out, their heaters went out. The government didn\u2019t give no water, no food, they didn\u2019t give nothing. Plus with the quarantines, it\u2019s already hard. You try to go to the store and there is barely any food.AIG: And a lot of the older people couldn\u2019t even go outside, so we were taking food to people\u2019s homes.What was it like when you were volunteering?CIA: We went to the office of [the Workers Defense Project] and there was a line of cars. We were just handing out food and water. [The organizers] also told us which apartments needed water and food and we would go there. It was amazing to see how much communication there was to get people what they needed.What kind of hot meals were you handing out?AIG: First off, it was healthy food. And food that we are accustomed to, like\u00a0chicken and rice. I am so grateful for the restaurants that offered hot meals, because many people didn\u2019t have a water filter so they couldn\u2019t cook [Editor\u2019s note: In many counties, notices were issued that those who did have water shouldn\u2019t consume it without filtering or boiling due to concerns about contamination]. I remember, when I was a recipient of meals, one that I really liked had chickpeas, mushrooms, and rice. The portions were also really generous.CIA: People were so shocked that we were giving them food that had the meat and rice and the good essential things the body needs. At first they didn\u2019t want to take it because they thought it wasn\u2019t free. Once I said it was free they would take a good amount. My mom would describe the food to them. She is really into flavors.AIG: I would say that the food is delicious and healthy. They would try it and say, \u201cWow!\u201d Everything had great flavor.CIA: They even told me, \u201cThere are usually not people helping our community out here, and the fact that you are doing it is amazing.\u201dWas it helpful to people that you could tell them, \u201cWe ate these meals just a few days ago, as we were in the exact same situation\u201d?CIA: Yeah, some people saw the food and were like, \u201cNo thank you.\u201d But once we put the food down and told them it\u2019s good, they were like, \u201cIf they like it, we are going to like it.\u201dWhat were some standouts from the meals that you all served?AIG: There was a brisket with rice and spinach. I added soy sauce to the rice.CIA: I don\u2019t really like vegetables. But I ate all the vegetables on that plate!AIG: I have tried brisket, but I haven\u2019t tried it with spinach. I had tried all these things, just not together. It was familiar enough. I knew if that was how I felt, that is probably how other people felt.CIA: I thought the food was going to be like the lunch from my school. But I was impressed by the flavor. When my mom first brought the meals home I thought she had cooked them.What were some of the reactions from the community as you were distributing meals and water? Any particular stories that stand out?AIG: I remember when we told them that everything was free, their expression would change. This is what impacted me the most. Seeing just how much they needed these things.CIA: It was amazing to see how people would communicate with their neighbors to help each other. I wish the whole community in Texas and around the world would be like that\u2014just trying to help each other out, no matter if it is a stranger.What were the biggest challenges as you were volunteering?AIG: A lot of people didn\u2019t realize the food was already cooked, and they thought they would have to prepare it themselves. So some tried to turn it away, saying they didn\u2019t have heat or water. And when we were giving out food, we always wore masks, we sanitized our hands, even the pens. But some people didn\u2019t wear masks.CIA: We were giving away food in a lot of apartment complexes, and the people who worked in the apartments, the managers, some of them didn\u2019t like us coming to their buildings. They were like, \u201cNo don\u2019t give water away, don\u2019t give food away.\u201d We were just trying to help.What have you learned from all of this? What do you think the long-term impact of the storm will be on the Texas community?AIG: Our apartment has water, and everything is good. But there is still a lot of help that this community needs, and people in Texas without running water.CIA: As a kid, I have learned that the government will not do a lot of things for the community. We have to help each other for us to be in a good stable place. A lot of people are in need, while we are just over here minding our own business. The more we help people, the more we will understand how many people need help.AIG: We plan on continuing to volunteer.The storm happened in the middle of a pandemic that continues to ravage the country\u2014and especially Texas. What do you think of Governor Abbott\u2019s recent decision to eliminate the state\u2019s mask mandate and allow businesses to open at full capacity?CIA: I think it is so unprofessional. How can you say that you are going to allow people to not wear masks when the virus is still out there? Just because the vaccine is out doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t still people dying from COVID.Ana Isabel, have you been able to get the vaccine?AIG: I\u2019m still waiting.You can support the Workers Defense Project and BASTA by making a donation, or if you\u2019re local, signing up to volunteer for their efforts.Explore Bon App\u00e9titTexasRecipes you want to make.
