Grilled kielbasa. Sausage with peppers and onions. Anise-heavy longanisa. Sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich. Currywurst. Pasta with sausage and broccoli rabe. Curry-laced sai ua. Boudin blanc. Fried rice with\u2014you guessed it\u2014sweet Chinese sausage. And you know what these sausages have in common? They\u2019re not the pork and rice sausage at Bida Manda in Raleigh, which is the best sausage I\u2019ve ever had. Hands down.For the uninitiated, it\u2019s a Laotian sausage made with pork, tons of aromatics, and\u2014surprise!\u2014rice. At Bida Manda, chef Lon Bounsanga makes it with a high-fat blend of ground pork (including pork belly) and jasmine rice, which in the past was used to stretch the meat in leaner times. Bounsanga continues to do this because the rice helps the sausage retain the flavor of the pork fat and all the other ingredients added to the sausage: lemongrass, dill, garlic, scallions, cilantro, and makrut lime leaves.The result is an incredibly complex sausage with a texture that\u2019s somewhere between crumbly and creamy and a flavor that juxtaposes lively, fresh herbs with salty, fatty pork. It comes grilled, sliced, and served with pickled ginger. And I now rest my case for the best sausage out there.Go there: Bida MandaExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendSausageRestaurantsRead MorecultureI\u2019d Like to Induct Olympia Provisions\u2019 Pepperettes Into the Salty Meat Snack Hall of FameBy Rachel KartenRecipes you want to make.
