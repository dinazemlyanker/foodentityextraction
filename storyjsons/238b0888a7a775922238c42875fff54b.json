But water glasses? Blame the mason jar trend of 2010, but somehow I have never assembled a matching set. My collection is a hodgepodge of thrift store scores, Ikea tumblers from college whose mates have long since shattered, and the one utilitarian pint glass that my fianc\u00e9e keeps trying to throw away. I can never justify spending money on something as mundane as glasses meant just for water, a beverage whose most noteworthy quality is that it tastes like nothing.Dessert glasses, on the other hand, are irresistibly frivolous and festive, and Lani Halliday\u2019s recipe for Candied Cucumbers With Vanilla Whip is an excellent excuse to buy some. It sounds like something out of an Edwardian children\u2019s book and demands a presentation that my holdout Ikea tumblers cannot provide. Instead, I like Our Place\u2019s Drinking Glasses\u2014pleasingly curved, a little bit retro, and perfect for layering the glistening cubes of cukes, toasted flakes of almonds, and cascading billows of whipped cream. Their beveled bottoms make for easy stacking, and they have a nice amount of heft, so you can aggressively scrape every last bit of whip from the bottom of the glass without fear of shattering. I\u2019d opt for the jade green Dawn color for a monochrome moment with the cucumbers or the amber-colored Sunset for maximum \u201970s appeal.It\u2019s also a major bonus for me that these glasses are produced by a mission-driven company founded by Shiza Shahid, who was raised in Pakistan and cofounded the Malala Fund with Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai before turning her attention to kitchenware. Our Place works with factories around the world\u2014the drinking glasses are hand-blown in Thailand\u2014that are audited by independent partners to ensure that workers are paid fairly and treated humanely.In addition to the Candied Cucumbers With Vanilla Whip, I could see using these glasses to serve an endless parade of desserts: sorbet with berries, pudding parfaits, or even individually portioned icebox cakes. And when they\u2019re not in use for the dessert course, what do you know, I\u2019ve tricked myself into buying a matching set of water glasses.Jason WoolwayOur Place Drinking Glasses, Set of 4$50 at Our PlaceExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyish Loves ItHealthyishDessertShoppingRecipes you want to make.
