You can play around by adding: 2 tsp. of fresh spices (think cinnamon, nutmeg, coriander, fennel), 1 tsp. citrus zest (lemon, lime, orange, grapefruit, added to the fruit filling), or a touch of heat (1 tsp. black pepper, 2 tsp. Tajin or Aleppo-style pepper, or \u00bd tsp. crushed red pepper flakes). For more galette inspiration, check out our Fall Fruit and Peach-Plum Galette.Ingredients8 servingsDough1\u00bdtsp. sugar\u00betsp. kosher salt1\u2153cups (180 g) all-purpose flour, plus more for surface\u00becup (1\u00bd sticks) chilled unsalted butterFilling and Assembly2tsp. cornstarch1tsp. finely grated lemon zest1tsp. kosher salt1tsp. freshly ground black pepper (optional)\u2153cup sugar, plus more for sprinkling2lb. strawberries or other berries, hulled, halved if large1Tbsp. fresh lemon juice1tsp. vanilla extract1Tbsp. heavy creamSoftly whipped cream or vanilla ice cream (for serving; optional)PreparationDoughStep 1Whisk sugar, salt, and 1\u2153 cups flour in a medium bowl. Cut butter into 6 rectangular pieces (if using \u00bd-cup sticks, cut them in half crosswise, then in half again lengthwise). Toss butter in dry ingredients to coat, then dump mixture out onto a work surface. Most recipes start by pulverizing fat into small bits, but here you\u2019ll use a rolling pin to flatten flour-coated butter into sheets that will puff into layers when baked.Photo by Michael Graydon and Nikole Herriott, Food Styling by Susie Theodorou, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiStep 2Roll butter into flour until it is in long flexible strips, using a bench scraper to scrape butter off rolling pin or surface as needed.Photo by Michael Graydon and Nikole Herriott, Food Styling by Susie Theodorou, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiStep 3Use bench scraper to gather mixture into a loose pile, then drizzle 4 Tbsp. ice water over.Photo by Michael Graydon and Nikole Herriott, Food Styling by Susie Theodorou, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiStep 4Using your hands and the bench scraper, toss mixture until water is distributed, then gather into a rectangular pile.Photo by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, Food Styling by Susie Theodorou, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiStep 5Roll out dough to a long rectangle with short ends about 8\" wide, then use bench scraper to fold dough into thirds, like folding a letter. It will be very crumbly and loose; don\u2019t panic. This turns the floury mass into a cohesive unit while creating flaky-making stacks of fat and flour.Photo by Michael Graydon and Nikole Herriott, Food Styling by Susie Theodorou, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiStep 6Using bench scraper to help, turn rectangle 90\u00b0 and repeat rolling and folding, gathering loose bits of dough from outer edges into the center and flouring surface as needed.Photo by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, Food Styling by Susie Theodorou, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiStep 7Repeat rolling and folding a third time. Dough should be somewhat homogenous and creamy-looking with some dry bits around edges. Squeeze a bit in your palm; it should loosely hold together. If not, repeat rolling and folding.Photo by Michael Graydon and Nikole Herriott, Food Styling by Susie Theodorou, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiStep 8Wrap folded dough in plastic, then press it into a compact disk about 1\" thick. Chill 30 minutes.Photo by Michael Graydon and Nikole Herriott, Food Styling by Susie Theodorou, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiStep 9Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to a 12\"\u201314\" round or oval about \u215b\" thick (don\u2019t worry about cracks around perimeter). Dust surface and rolling pin with flour as needed and rotate dough often to prevent wider cracks. If dough sticks to surface, lift on one side and scatter flour underneath before continuing. Roll dough onto your pin, then unfurl it on a sheet of parchment paper. Slide onto a rimmed baking sheet and chill while you prep the filling.Photo by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, Food Styling by Susie Theodorou, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiStep 10Do Ahead: Dough can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled, or transfer to a resealable plastic bag and freeze up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before rolling out.Filling and AssemblyStep 11Preheat oven to 400\u00b0. Combine cornstarch,  lemon zest, salt, pepper (if using), and \u2153 cup sugar in a medium bowl. Toss with your hands to combine, then add strawberries and toss to coat. Add lemon juice and vanilla; toss gently.Step 12Arrange berry mixture in the center of chilled dough (still on parchment on baking sheet) and spread out evenly, leaving a 3\" border. Fold edges of dough up and over fruit, pleating as needed and being careful that folded edge of dough doesn\u2019t tear (if it does, patch with dough scraps and pinch to seal).Photo by Michael Graydon and Nikole Herriott, Food Styling by Susie Theodorou, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiStep 13Pour cream into a small bowl and brush all over dough. Sprinkle sugar evenly over dough.Photo by Michael Graydon and Nikole Herriott, Food Styling by Susie Theodorou, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiStep 14Place galette in oven and immediately reduce heat to 375\u00b0. Bake, rotating halfway through, until crust is deep golden brown everywhere, berries are softened, and juices are bubbling, 45\u201350 minutes. Let cool 2 hours before serving.Step 15Serve galette with whipped cream or ice cream if desired.How would you rate Any Berry Galette?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (7)Back to TopTriangleWhy do we have to pay now to see recipes?SaraCalifornia 2/5/2022I didn't have enough berries so I used some apples. I absolutely love this pastry and have made several galettes.  I also used this pastry for my sweet potato pie. Some of them leaked some juices out, but the galettes were still delicious. I shall always use this pastry recipe as my regular pies, too. Love it!K Sameshima Nederland, Colorado 12/7/2021This is possibly the worst dough I've ever had the misfortune of wasting ingredients on.\n\nIt completely melted and fell apart, and the filling was far too juicy and made a soggy mess.\n\nCompletely inedible.\n\nTossed it into the garbage as soon as it came out of the oven.TyPhoenix, AZ1/22/2021I tried this recipe and followed it exactly, even though I suspected tat the thickening was not enough.  I was so right.  The filling was so liquid that it almost disssolved the crust and the galette was inedible.  I wasted a quart of fresh raspberries.  I made it again using 5 TABLESPOONS of Minute tapicoa and it was perfect.  I cannot believe that this reccipe had ever been tested.Carole MillerMiami,FL12/26/2020I was a little hesitant at the messy crust method, but after a few lame crusts using food processors, I tried it this way. It isn't as much of a mess or effort as it looks. It takes a bit more time than a food processor, but not by much, and one of the truly flaky crusts I have ever made, so I would say give it a try if you haven't. I made this with blueberries I had on hand, it was superb. AnonymousMichigan7/29/2020The crust is great - yes, it's very messy to make but it comes together and even in my very warm kitchen I was able to get quite a flaky texture. The filling was good, but the juices ran out of the tart like crazy. I'm not sure if this was my dough being too warm or bad folding technique, but huge pools of burning strawberry juice formed on the sheet pan. I scraped them away after it cooled and the part that did stay in the crust tastes nice.AnonymousNew York3/30/2020This recipe looks delicious!! I want to try it this weekend but with It being winter... i'm curious if this would work with frozen fruit? Or would it be too soggy? madifrielBaltimore, MD1/23/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titGaletteDessertFruit DessertStrawberryBerryFruitSummerNut-FreeBakingFourth Of JulyMemorial DayLabor DayRecipes you want to make.
