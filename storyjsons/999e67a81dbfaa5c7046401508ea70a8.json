CindySeattle, WA7/22/2021Loved this dip! Did not find it to be *that* labor intensive, like other commenters, but that might just be me. I did also add extra lemon juice and a couple tablespoons of water, because the tahini flavor is definitely strong. Excellent with crunchy bell peppers and cucumbers.MelanieSt. Louis, MO6/1/2021This is a great recipe but needs some slight adjustments to make it perfect for my family. We had no issues with eh tahini flavor but it definitely needed more spiciness for us. We also swapped the chard for a mix of spinach and kale which turned out great. I think we will add some fresh jalape\u00f1os and garlic next time but we are definitely making this again!AnonymousWashington, DC1/3/2021Interesting dip, but the tahini is definitely overpowering. Somehow ended up with a bitter flavor. I might try to add in some feta to mellow it out. I'd use half the amount of tahini next time.karminomadaCuyahoga Falls, Ohio8/15/2020Amazing!! I was kinda scared it would have that green grassy taste, so I used a little less chard, but I am here to say: do not be afraid! Use all the chard! This dip is sooo good & doesn't taste green if ya know what I mean! If you think it's not flavorful enough, add more lemon/salt! I could see getting wacky and adding chickpeas, making it some sort of hummus crossover.. hmmjlamms27Wisconsin5/26/2020I only made a small amount as I had half a bag of spinach to get rid of - but can't wait to make in larger quantity! I think any greens will work. So for those saying it's too labor-intensive, use spinach or other soft green (or even herbs!) next time!AnonymousUK5/12/2020Absolutely delicious! I added just a dash of acv to the chard while I was cooking it and added a little raw garlic to the processor to add a little more bite and acidity. I will definitely make this again Chelse.ROakland CA 1/6/2020Really impressed and pleased with this recipe. Came together quickly on Sunday night and has made my Monday 1000x better. Matched with some Mary Brown's crackers and I'm a happy lady. Added an extra 1/4c of lemon as I needed a lot more acid, but that is dependent on the lemons you're using and the time of year. Saved my swiss chard from the bin on it's last day of use! Will try with other wilting greens that end up in my veggie drawer, I imagine it'd be great with any hearty green.Anonymous8/12/2019Lovely! Use more lemon than you think, otherwise it's too tahini heavy but I prefer things more acidic so it could just be me. The swiss chard isn't that time intensive, the whole thing took under 30 mins. Anonymous10/17/2018I loved it! Incredible creamy texture. Sure, it takes some time to soften the stems, but during that time I chopped garlic, squeezed lemon juice, and measured tahini. I didn't really squeeze that much liquid from greens ultimately, and it turned out great. Will make again and possibly add some chile. alexbeggsBA.com 9/30/2018I found the tahini taste too strong, I would have halved it with something else to make it a bit lighter. Also, the consistency was a bit too thick for a dip, but maybe this was just me not adding enough chard liquid.AnonymousOxford, UK9/25/2018Positives: healthy. Negatives: labor-intensive, only moderately flavorful.303249/12/2018Great! A little labor intensive with the chard...but it reads as more time-consuming than it actually is.  A nice change of pace from other tahini-based dips, and I felt better about myself bc of the greens. I ended up using quite a bit of the squeezed out liquid and it maintained a nice consistency.
