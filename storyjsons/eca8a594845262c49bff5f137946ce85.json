But if I\u2019m ever in a restaurant before noon, I\u2019m at Davelle. It helps that the Japanese all-day cafe is just blocks away from my Lower East Side apartment, but I would happily journey cross-borough to start my day with their Kyoto-style cold brew, elegantly dispensed from a vaguely steampunk slow-drip Oji cold brew machine.While Davelle\u2019s lunch and dinner menus are devoted to all kinds of delicious things, from uni spaghetti to fluffy omurice, the morning menu is a singular salute to toast. But there\u2019s a twist: There\u2019s no avocado in sight. Instead, thick slabs of Japanese milk bread are artistically smeared with a cream cheese and berry jam checkerboard, polka dots of cinnamon sugar, or swirls of natto (fermented soybeans) and cheese. Each toast is stunningly beautiful\u2014but far too tasty to be pure Instagram bait.Best of all, the quietly minimalist space feels miles away from the hysteria of boozy brunch and bagel lines. It\u2019s also an excellent launchpad for lazy walks up to the Union Square greenmarket or other dreamy weekend activities. On rare weekday mornings, I\u2019ll even stop by before work for cream cheese toast and a corner seat at the bar. There, with sunshine on my back and a cup of genmaicha in hand, the charms of early rising are revealed.Go there: DavelleExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendNew York CityRestaurantsRead MorerestaurantsYes, There Are Potato Chips in Your Bagel SandwichBy Rachel KartenRecipes you want to make.
