When they\u2019re steamed, vegetables come out refreshed and hydrated, as if they\u2019ve spent a day at the spa. They taste like their best selves, ready to be zhuzhed up with a punchy ginger-soy dressing. It all happens in the time it would take to heat up the oven\u2014and there\u2019s no oily baking sheet to clean when you\u2019re done.Ingredients4 servings3scallions, white and dark green parts separated, thinly sliced1garlic clove, finely chopped2Tbsp. seasoned rice vinegar2Tbsp. toasted sesame oil1Tbsp. soy sauce2tsp. honey1tsp. finely chopped peeled ginger1small kabocha or 2 acorn squash (about 2 lb.)1tsp. toasted sesame seedsPreparationStep 1Pour water into a large saucepan, wide skillet, or large wok to come 1\" up the sides and place over medium-high heat. Mix white and pale-green parts of scallions, garlic, vinegar, oil, soy sauce, honey, and ginger in a small heatproof ramekin. Set inside a large bamboo steamer off heat (or, if using a metal insert, don\u2019t bring water to a simmer and fit into saucepan before adding dressing. Cover dressing with foil.)Step 2Cut squash in half; scoop out and discard seeds. Slice into \u00bd\"-thick wedges. Arrange in steamer basket around ramekin, overlapping a little if needed (for metal insert, add as much squash as will fit without piling up, placing over dressing).  Set over saucepan (or turn on heat), cover, and steam until squash is tender (a tester, skewer, or paring knife should easily slide through flesh), 13\u201315 minutes.Step 3Transfer squash to a platter and top with scallion greens and sesame seeds.

Could have made a little extra dressingC\u00e9cileBoston, MA11/2/2021Throw the squash seeds away?? Why? Lightly toast them for a tasty snack, shell and all!Jersey City, NJ10/1/2020This has quickly become a lunch-at-home favorite; easy, healthy, riffable. It was great the first time, made as directed, and it was great the next four times adjusted to our tastes/fridge situation; swap the sauce for leftovers or your  favorite quick mix (but still cook it in a ramekin in the steamer, for gooey thickness and ease). Have fun with toppings; we liked toasted coconut with cardamom, toasted puffed rice with cumin and salt,  bonito, crumbled seaweed snacks etc etc (and always loads of scallions). I like to steam for more like 50 minutes, for really lavishly soft squashAnonymousBoston MA4/30/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titEast AsianAsianKabocha SquashSquashVegetableWinterQuickEasySideStarterDairy-FreeVegetarianHealthyishSteamDinnerRecipes you want to make.
