When something\u2019s so easy to make that you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed. Today: how to make palmiers.Every sugar fiend (show yourselves!) has a handful of insta-sweets: a spoonful of peanut butter covered in chocolate chips; a frozen banana blended with cocoa powder and brown sugar; a mini marshmallow, a Golden Graham, and a square of dark chocolate, all stuffed in your mouth at the same time (lazy s\u2019mores?); a Tate\u2019s cookie crumbled up and soaked in milk (what a former colleague affectionately dubbed \u201ccookie cereal\u201d).But these are desserts to eat in solitude. When you\u2019re hosting a friend for the first time in, say, 19-plus months, maybe you don\u2019t want to bring out the cookie butter and the Oreos. (Keep those little pleasures for yourself.)And that\u2019s where palmiers come into play. They\u2019re as easy and as close to instant as beautiful baked goods get. All you need is a package of puff pastry and sugar to make cookies (or are they pastries?) so plump, so shiny with caramel, that they look like they came straight from a Glossier ad.How to make palmiers:Start by defrosting 2 sheets of puff pastry. You can do this the responsible way (in the fridge overnight), but when you need dessert now, you\u2019ll likely take the live-fast-die-hard route: Unwrap the sheets and leave them on a baking sheet, closely monitored to prevent floppiness, until pliable enough to unfurl.Once your puff pastry is defrosted, you\u2019ll need to roll it out to smooth the cracks and create a slightly larger square. Some recipes will have you roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface, then sprinkle it with sugar and press to adhere. I, however, prefer the more extreme option, which I picked up from doyennes Ina Garten and Martha Stewart, which is to roll the pastry directly in the sugar itself. If you\u2019re using two sheets of pastry, start by mixing 1\u00bc cups of sugar with 1 pinch of kosher salt. Pour \u00be cup onto a cutting board then distribute it into a fairly even layer.\u00a0\u00a0Working with one sheet at a time, set the pastry in the sugar and sprinkle \u00bc cup additional sugar over top, like you\u2019re burying it in sand. Roll the pastry until you have a rough square\u2014it should be between 12\"\u201315\" on each side, with every bit of dough covered in sugar to ensure maximum caramelization.If you get your hands on chocolate puff pastry, consider yourself blessed.\nNow it\u2019s time to shape. While you can roll each side in, like you\u2019re making a double scroll (think Torah), I find folding easier and neater. Fold each side halfway to the center\u2014they won\u2019t meet yet. Then fold them once again, this time so they do touch. For the final fold you\u2019ll prop one side completely over the other so that you\u2019re left with a long, skinny log with six layers total. Transfer it to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and stick it in the fridge. Plop the other sheet of pastry down into the sugar that\u2019s left on the board (adding more if necessary), then sprinkle over that final \u00bc cup sugar and proceed to roll and fold like before.Chill the pastry logs\u2014this will make them easier to slice neatly\u2014while the oven heats to 425\u00b0. Line a second baking sheet with parchment paper. Finally, transfer your logs back to the work surface, use a sharp knife to slice them into 1/4\"\u20131/2\" pieces, and arrange the palmiers cut side up across the sheet pans, leaving some space for them to grow. Bake 8\u201315 minutes (time will vary based on their thickness), carefully flipping the cookies over halfway through baking, until the sugar has caramelized. Cool for a few minutes on the trays before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.How to change them up:While these plain palmiers are delightfully crisp and buttery, they\u2019re also open for interpretation. Instead of granulated sugar, go with turbinado, which has a deeper, more caramelized flavor and a crunchier texture. Add cocoa powder and cinnamon\u2014hot chocolate! Or blitz that granulated sugar with freeze-dried fruit, moisten it with lemon (or grapefruit!) zest and vanilla bean seeds, or season it with pumpkin pie spice or ground ginger.You can also swerve left and go savory: Skip the sugar, roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface, and spread it with cream cheese and everything-bagel spice or Kewpie mayo and furikake. Or sprinkle it with za\u2019atar or nutritional yeast and black pepper. Or if you want a recipe, make Claire Saffitz\u2019s roasted garlic and rosemary version.At that point, of course, you\u2019re no longer scratching that sweet tooth itch. But that\u2019s what cookie cereal is for.Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
