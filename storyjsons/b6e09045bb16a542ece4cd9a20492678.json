But at lunchtime the place transforms, like Lady Gaga taking off her makeup, into something even more resplendent. The tablecloths are replaced by worn-in flannel-backed vinyl covers, printed with a photo-realistic trompe l\u2019oeil of a picnic table strewn with bowls of bland-looking orecchiette and fusilli pasta, accented by the occasional lost red onion or errant head of broccoli. Some tables are covered in cheeses, others in a riot of baguettes and ciabatta loaves that has been described by guests as \u201cfantastic\u201d and \u201cso strange.\u201dEduardo Erazo, Sole di Capri\u2019s owner of 13 years, told me that his wife found the one-of-a-kind coverings in a town in Northern Italy on their last trip there three years ago\u2014they came from large rolls, which are then cut to size. She was particularly drawn to the coverings decorated in pastas and cheeses. \u201cThe bread is too cute.\u201d The coverings have a global fan base, Erazo said. \u201cTourists come in from France and Italy, and they ask if they can buy them.\u201dSole di Capri\u2019s placemats are only on view at lunch\u2014at dinner they change to white tablecloths.\nPhoto by Cole WilsonErazo isn\u2019t selling. He likes them for the daytime because they\u2019re easier to clean than white tablecloths. When pressed to explain why he uses white tablecloths at all, Erazo said, \u201cOur prices are lower during the day. At night people spend more!\u201d But anyone who\u2019s eaten at Sole di Capri can confirm the lunchtime tablecloths are reason enough to patronize the restaurant. They\u2019re like the bright-orange flower-power slipcovers my mom used to whip off the furniture when guests would come over\u2014everyone liked them better than whatever pattern was underneath. That must be why they give me a sense of uncanny nostalgia that traditional red- and blue-checked tablecloths fail to arouse. I find myself wondering: Did a beloved childhood friend have a pasta tablecloth? Was I born on a pasta tablecloth?Some people (heretics) have suggested it\u2019s overkill for a restaurant that deals largely in pasta to cover its tables in pasta (and bread and cheese) art. I can see why detractors might feel overwhelmed while enjoying a bowl of tagliatelle alle acciughe mere inches away from a photo-realistic pile of un-sauced, underwhelming penne, but I think that\u2019s the magic. At a time when reality is so rarely better than the picture, the food Sole di Capri serves looks so much better than the stuff that\u2019s printed underneath.Lauren Larson is a writer and editor in New York City, aspiring to be a writer and editor in Bali.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsItalian AmericanRed SauceNew York CityRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
