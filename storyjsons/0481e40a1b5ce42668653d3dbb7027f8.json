The burgers my parents prepared most Saturday afternoons; the chicken my dad threw on the grill; even catfish, a bottom-feeder best served deep-fried\u2014those were all \u201cgood\u201d meats. Most proteins were, actually. Just not veal. While I can\u2019t pin down exactly where my acute awareness of this ethical binary originated, I have a feeling I owe it to one of American pop culture\u2019s most famous and outspoken vegetarians: Lisa Simpson, the righteous, animated permatween who\u2019s been refusing meat on The Simpsons since the series\u2019 seventh season, which aired in 1995. (At one point, four seasons later, she explicitly asks her carnivorous boomer father, Homer, for a meal that wasn\u2019t \u201cbrutally slaughtered.\u201d \u201cI think the veal might have died of loneliness,\u201d he replies, as smoke billows off the grill.)Lisa, like most representations of vegetarians in pop culture, is both the butt of jokes and a moral compass for her audience\u2014someone whose guidance we meat eaters would absolutely follow if only steak weren\u2019t so tasty when prepared medium-rare. When it comes to veal, though, Americans of all diets largely agree it\u2019s one of those cuts probably best served not at all. (Spoiler: It\u2019s sourced from baby cows that are often confined to small crates to prohibit muscle growth to keep things tender and fed a low-iron diet to keep their flesh pink. And out of vogue it\u2019s become.)The veal spiedini, in all its rolled up, lightly breaded, white wine\u2013baked glory.\nPhoto by Cole WilsonExcept\u2026at red sauce restaurants. \u201cTo native Italians, veal was always a delicacy,\u201d Paul Petronella, owner of Paulie\u2019s in Houston, told me by phone, framing veal as a matter of generations-old tradition and not of ethics. \u201cOver the past couple years, the prices have gone way up, but we do want to keep it on our menu.\u201d And he\u2019s not the only one. If you check the kitchens at many of the country's legendary Italian-American joints, from Rao\u2019s in Manhattan to Italian Village in Chicago to Dan Tana\u2019s in West Hollywood, you\u2019re almost guaranteed to find it. And not just slotted between the chicken parm and pork chop, but as its own dedicated menu section with more preparations than you can count on two hands: pounded and breaded, doused in Marsala sauce, rolled and stuffed, saut\u00e9ed, grilled, and fried. Walking inside these places feels like going back in time, so why should their menus be any different?I experienced a time warp of my own recently at Vinny\u2019s, a charmingly kitschy, brightly lit joint in Brooklyn\u2019s historically Italian Carroll Gardens neighborhood. The brisk March night I visited with my husband, I didn\u2019t plan on ordering veal for the second\u2014and likely last\u2014time in my life, but at the suggestion of my server, I chose the veal spiedini, a dish alluringly described as a veal cutlet with mozzarella, \u201crolled up, lightly breaded, baked in white wine sauce.\u201d\u201cWhen in Rome,\u201d my husband announced before deciding on the pizzaiola, a dish of saut\u00e9ed veal and tomato-garlic sauce.Our dishes arrived not long after, and I looked at the glistening bedrolls of pale meat and cheese. A very Simpson\u2019s visual appeared in my mind: three frustratingly mouthwatering spiedini sucked from spiedini-shaped holes of an anime-eyed cartoon calf. I cut into my first bite. It was delicate, delicious. By the second bite, I regretted the order. At some point during the third, I convinced myself that nothing could be done now; the cow had been killed without my consent, and I would have to eat it so it wouldn\u2019t go to waste\u2026right? The intricacies of veal production clouded every perfectly tender bite that followed. Joy, then guilt. Joy, then guilt. I lacked both the willpower and moral courage to ignore the former and was raised Catholic enough to cope with the latter.Still wracked with confused feelings days later, I reached out to the American Veal Association (there is such a thing) to ask some questions. \u201cThings are soooo different on veal farms today compared to the \u201980s, \u201990s,\u201d AVA\u2019s executive director Donna Moenning told me via email, in an effort to make me feel better about my decisions. \u201cConsumers who love meat and enjoy Italian cuisine featuring veal appreciate the changes the industry has made for more humanely, and sustainably produced, veal.\u201dI was struck by the number of o\u2019s in Moenning\u2019s sentence and interpreted them as evidence of her own uncertainty\u2014a Freudian keystroke suggesting some combination of willful ignorance and overcompensation. Joy, then guilt. Joy, then guilt. It appears to go all the way up the food chain.Bobby Finger is a Brooklyn-based writer and co-host of the podcast Who?
