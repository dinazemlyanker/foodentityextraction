It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.The problem with standing up most of the day cooking food for other people to taste, and tasting food that other people have cooked, is that when I get home I don\u2019t always feel like cooking. But a girl\u2019s gotta eat! Even with my job in the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen, I still have the \u201cwhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d problem.The answer, as always, is eggs. Eggs are everything: they\u2019re inexpensive, high in protein, tasty sweet or savory, and done in minutes. They are a perfect, whole food, they are filling, and they are our heroes. Yes, we eat them in the morning. But since everyone likes saying \u201cbreakfast for dinner,\u201d I would like you to make a folded, stuffed, and loaded omelet tonight.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Selling point No. 1 one: Bacon is involved. Cooking bacon is the first step in the recipe, and when you set those crisped-up pieces aside, you use the rendered fat left in the pan to cook some chopped mushrooms. Salty, crunchy, earthy, and bouncy: Mushrooms and bacon are a power duo, two culinary greats with a lot of love for each other.Photo by Ted CavanaughSelling point No. 2: Ricotta is on the scene. When I was developing this recipe, I wanted to add something cheesy and melty in the omelet\u2019s center, ideally something that would soften even when subjected to the moderate heat of softly cooked eggs. I originally looked to cream cheese to find some ooze, but it cooled things down too much and stayed pretty firm. I then switched to ricotta, folding it into the cooked mushrooms, along with some Parmesan, which created a creamy, slightly salty, savory filling that surrenders blissfully when warmed.Selling point No. 3: the eggs make the meal. For dinner, I wanted the heft of a three-egg omelet, but I didn\u2019t want to go to the trouble of making two omelets, one after the other. Even though they\u2019re quick to cook, someone will get a not-quite-hot omelet, and I don\u2019t want that someone to be me. So I devised this monster of a six-egg omelet that can be cut in half, since by now my husband has certainly arrived home from work and he\u2019d love to get in on some dinner action, \u201cif you\u2019re making!\u201d To make this omelet-for-two, the heat is moderate, and the mixing is swift. As soon as the underside is set and large curds form, the ricotta-mushroom mixture is spooned on top, then the still-crisp bacon. Instead of rolling, which is cumbersome and annoying to do, fold this omelet in half like a taco before sliding right out of the skillet and cutting it in half. If it were my A.M. meal, some buttered toast would be just the thing. But to make this more dinner-ish, it\u2019s paired with some tender lettuces and herbs that have been dressed with a simple vinaigrette.One pan, four strips of bacon, a handful of mushrooms, six eggs, some ricotta. It doesn\u2019t sound like much, but 15 minutes later, it adds up to dinner.Get the recipe:Omelet With Bacon, Mushrooms, and RicottaDon\u2019t sweat rolling this into a perfect omelet; just top the cooked eggs with mushrooms and ricotta, and fold like a taco.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterOmeletRead MorecookingWhen Life Gives You Avocados, Make WaterBy Carla Lalli MusicRecipes you want to make.
