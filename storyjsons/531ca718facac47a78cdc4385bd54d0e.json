Meet my new favorite potato chip plunge pool.By Hilary CadiganJune 26, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Heidi's BridgeFacebookTwitterEmailAt eight years old, I discovered my greatest love. And that love\u2019s name was onion dip.As a kid, there was no greater pleasure than the first dip of a chip into a snow-white pool of luscious dairy fat, its cloud-like surface studded with translucent shards of rehydrated onion. It was the perfect mouthfeel before I knew what mouthfeels were: the cool, gloppy dip soft and tangy against the sharp salty crunch of the chip. To this day, I know no greater joy.In my household, onion dip came in two forms: sour cream + Lipton soup mix if my mom was feeling fancy; a store-bought tub of Heluva Good! (the exclamation point is part of the name) if I managed to sneak one into the grocery cart when she wasn\u2019t looking. I was in my late twenties by the time my boyfriend informed me that it\u2019s actually pronounced \u201cHell-uv-a,\u201d as in, \u201cHell of a good dip\u201d and not the highly embarrassing \u201cHel-loo-va\u201d my mom fooled me into thinking it was for nearly two decades. (I still call it Heloova though because whatever.)If you invite me to a party, and there is onion dip on the table, you can bet your sweet bottom I will plant myself next to that not-big-enough bowl and remain there, speaking to no one, until the last streaks of sour cream have been wiped clean. If someone else drops a chip into the bowl and walks away like a reckless, slovenly ingrate (this is what you are if you do this), I will fish that chip out and eat it myself. Because I care. Because I cannot be tamed. Because I love onion dip more than I love my own dignity.But here\u2019s the thing. Although going ham on a pile o\u2019 chips and dip feels amazing while you\u2019re doing it, it feels...really not amazing afterwards. That giant macerated lump of full-fat dairy and sodium and potato carbs can sit like a bowling ball in the pit of your stomach for hours. The roof of your mouth burns with the fire of MSG. Even your face starts to feel greasy. You need to leave the party early. People start identifying you as that grown adult woman who comes to social functions, camps out in a creepy stupor beside the snack table, then leaves without talking to anyone in a cloud of bad breath and shame and stomach pain.It\u2019s not that the onion dip isn\u2019t worth all that. It\u2019s maybe just not a part of living your Best Adult Life.But guess what, friends. There is another way: this new slow-roasted onion dip recipe.Kettle chips FTW.\nThis innovative dip\u2019s merits rest solidly on its base: rather than sour cream or mayonnaise or a combination of both, it uses one simple ingredient: Greek yogurt. Just as lush and tart as the sour cream it replaces, Greek yogurt is also straight-up good for you! It has protein and calcium and potassium and B vitamins and its own thrilling cadre of buzzwords like \u201cprobiotics\u201d and \u201cgut health.\u201d Using something that is a part of a balanced breakfast as a dip base sounds like a good solve to me!Here's how it comes together. You start with a pound and a half of onions, a mix of colors. Really whatever you have lying around will do: red, yellow, white, sweet, Vidalia, Spanish. Just have at it. Then don a pair of goggles, preheat your oven to 400 degrees, open a window, and brace yourself for the hell that\u2019s coming: chopping a pound and a half of onions. There\u2019s no way around this, folks. (Unless you sob so loudly that your fiance gets tired of listening to you and takes over. Hot tip from yours truly.) Halve them, peel them, and then slice them all as thinly as possible until your eyeballs feel like they\u2019re about to fall out of your face.Next, put your onion slices, four cloves of unpeeled garlic, a quarter cup of olive oil, and some kosher salt in a bowl and toss until everything is evenly coated. Dump it all into a mound atop a parchment-lined baking sheet\u2014don\u2019t spread the onions out; just leave \u2018em piled up so they steam and soften slowly\u2014and pop it into the oven. This is kind of delightful because usually to make a good homemade onion dip you have to spend an hour sweating over the stove and breathing in onion fumes. In this case, you\u2019ll want to check your onions and move them around a bit every ten minutes or so, but aside from that you can just chill and watch season two of The Office for the 97th time.And that\u2019s pretty much it! Once the onions come out, just let \u2018em cool and dice \u2018em up. Squeeze out your garlic cloves and crush them into a paste, add two teaspoons of lemon juice, and stir everything together with a cup and a half of full-fat Greek yogurt. Put it in a pretty bowl or trough, garnish with a pinch of cayenne, and serve with fresh halved radishes and some properly salty potato chips. Heluva, shmeloova.
