Rotisserie chicken, store-bought puff pastry, and just one skillet keep this hearty dinner recipe from feeling too fussy\u2014or taking all day to make. If you've never worked with frozen puff pastry before, know this: Letting it thaw overnight in the fridge overnight is non-negotiable. If you try to work with puff pastry that is not fully thawed, it'll crack and become a whole mess, and nobody wants that. But just the smallest bit of planning ahead will be rewarded with buttery, flaky, pot pie perfection.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Remove and discard skin of 1 rotisserie chicken, then shred meat into 1\" pieces (you should have 4\u20135 cups meat); set aside. You won't need the bones and carcass from the chicken for this recipe, but that doesn't mean you should throw them out\u2014sling them into a saucepan, cover with water, add whatever aromatics you've got lying around, and you've got the makings of a couple decent quarts of chicken stock.Step 2Time to prep your vegetables! Cut 2 onions in half through root, trim root ends, then peel. Finely chop onion and transfer to a medium bowl.Step 3Peel 1 lb. turnips, then trim off knobby root ends. Cut in half through the root end. Cut each half into \u00be\"-thick planks, then finely chop planks into \u00be\" pieces. Transfer to another medium bowl.Step 4Lightly smash 6 garlic cloves with the flat side of a chef\u2019s knife. Peel, then coarsely chop. Transfer to bowl with turnips.Step 5Add 1 Tbsp. thyme leaves (from about 2 sprigs) to bowl with turnips and garlic.Step 6Melt 3 Tbsp. butter in a 12\" skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium heat. (Just make sure whatever you're using is oven-safe\u2014you don't want a melting plastic handle.) Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until very soft but not browned, 5\u20136 minutes.Step 7Add turnip mixture, season with 1 tsp. salt and 1\u00bd tsp. pepper, and cook, stirring often, until just beginning to soften, 3 minutes.Step 8Sprinkle 3 Tbsp. flour over vegetables and cook, stirring constantly, until flour begins to stick to bottom of pan, about 30 seconds. The flour is going to help thicken the gravy you're trying to create.Step 9Add 1 cup wine and cook, stirring constantly, to burn off some of the alcohol, about 1 minute.Step 10Set aside 1 Tbsp. cream. Add remaining cream, reserved chicken, 10 oz. peas, and 1\u00bd tsp. salt and bring to a simmer. Taste and adjust for seasoning. Cook, tossing occasionally, until warmed through, 3\u20134 minutes. Transfer skillet to a rimmed baking sheet, which will prevent any juices that bubble out of the pan from spilling onto your oven floor.Step 11Roll out 14 oz. puff pastry on a lightly floured surface into a 13\" square (large enough to cover skillet with a bit of overhang). Roll pastry up onto rolling pin. (You could use an empty wine bottle if you don't have a rolling pin.) Unfurl pastry from rolling pin, draping it over skillet.Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 12Trim pastry so that there is a 1\" border all around. Fold edge of puff pastry under itself. Crimp edges with a fork (just like you would do when making the top crust of a pie).Step 13Using a pastry brush, brush top of pastry with reserved cream. Cut 5\u20136 small slits in the center so steam can escape. Bake pot pie until crust is light golden brown, 22\u201324 minutes.Step 14Reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0 and continue to bake until filling is bubbling around the edges and crust is well browned, 25\u201335 minutes longer. Let sit 10 minutes before serving.How would you rate One-Skillet Rotisserie Chicken Pot Pie?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (43)Back to TopTriangleExcellent. I substituted wine for Chicken Broth, carrots and rutabaga instead of Peas. Transferred to a casserole dish and covered with pie crust.  My oven cooked for almost 2 hoursSun Flower492701/14/2022Tremendous. I\u2019ve made it many times. So easy to follow the recipe. I\u2019ve shared the recipe many times with total strangers while standing, waiting for the rotisserie chickens to come out of the oven at Costco:-) A must try. Bon Appetit! ThomasWaterloo Canada12/3/2021Even vegetarians need to add salt to their food. This is a great recipe. I\u2019ve made it twice now , once with chicken , and I\u2019ve with leftover turkey. Read the directions and taste your food. Thanks molly and thanks ba. Trying to help losersWest Virginia11/29/2021This is my go to chicken pot pie recipe! I love how there\u2019s only a top crust and it\u2019s so easy to make in one skillet. I was nervous about the turnips at first, but they truly are sweet and amazing. I will never go back to carrots in my pot pie again! Molly Baz is my hero and queen. Courtney W. Norfolk, VA 11/14/2021I\u2019ve been jonesing fro CPP, and I was so happy to find this recipe. Sadly, I found it extremely bland even with the addition of a pinch of cayenne, Worcestershire, celery and carrots. My husband liked it, but I need more umami. Barb De11/7/202110/10!!! Amazing. This is a great recipe that I will make again and again. Wouldn\u2019t change a thing. AnonymousColumbia, SC7/20/2021We wanted it to be great and thought it was going to be great and it turned out to be just so-so. I even added a splash of sherry and some MSG, and carrots, and a little vinegar, and still it was curiously bland and well, uninteresting. But I'm glad the rest of y'all love it.  We did find that a good squirt of Tabasco sriracha (or whatever hot sauce you have) improves it greatly.  \n\nNote: the best CPP I ever had was from the Cook's Illustrated 1000 Best Recipes book. So good!PaulTexas5/25/2021Once again Molly Baz does not disappoint! This was so delicious and easy. My family and I first made it the day after thanksgiving and used up leftover Turkey. We used ground thyme because we didn\u2019t have any fresh but it still was so flavorful and such a great comfort food. We made a second time with the rotisserie chicken and it was still good \u2014 but the Turkey was honestly the best! This will now be our go to for day after t-giving meals.  Sarah BRaleigh, NC1/30/2021Delicious and time saving! I've done this one and the BA classic chicken pot pie, and I feel like this portion is more reasonable and the recipe moves along more easily. Using roti chix is genius! I love the incorporation of turnips and - I think most of us can agree - everything Molly Baz touches turns to gold. Thanks! Laura BNashville, TN1/28/2021My only complaint was the crust. It wasn't what I was hoping for, more of a soft crust than a hard pie-like crust like I'm used to. Next time, I'll just make my own crust or get a store-bought regular pie crust instead of the phyllo dough.JoyBugSan Antonio, TX12/11/2020This is a keeper!  In order to duplicate one of my childhood \"comfort\" foods (Swanson frozen pot pies, haha!) I used carrots instead of turnips, added a bit more wine, less cream than called for (1.5 cups) and seasoned to taste until I hit the nail on the head which I did and the pie was perfectly lovely.  I loved being able to cook, from start to finish, in one pan.  Cleaning up was a breeze.  I'll look forward to cooking this again and trying different winter veggies throughout the wintertime months.  AnonymousBordeaux, France10/28/2020LOVE this recipe! Found it about a month ago and I\u2019ve already made it three times. I add a little extra thyme, use half homemade chicken stock and half wine, and replace half the turnips with carrots, but without my changes this recipes rocks and will make a great wintertime dish.Detroit, MI9/29/2020I\u2019ve been making bon Appetit recipes for over a year. Every one has turned out exceptional (even better than exceptional!) most of the time....except for Molly\u2019s. Every recipe I\u2019ve tried from Molly has been a complete disaster. \n\nI\u2019ve tried this one a few times, multiple ways, and nope. Either bon Appetit is withholding information or somebody doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing. I feel like it\u2019s Molly. \n\nExperienced chef here - everyone\u2019s recipes work. All of bon Appetit except for Molly\u2019s. Just stating the facts. AnonymousWho cares?6/11/2020Amazing!!!Anonymousoakland6/10/2020This was FANTASTIC! Everything you want from a chicken pot pie.
