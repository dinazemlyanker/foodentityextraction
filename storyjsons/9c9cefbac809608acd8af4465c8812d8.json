It\u2019s cheese in a can. And it\u2019s great.\u00a0By Jessica KellyJanuary 14, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Emma FishmanFacebookTwitterEmailAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

You can get a loaf of bread, a cheeseburger, a \u201cwhole chicken\u201c (if you can count it as such, because it comes out all butchered and congealed), rattlesnake, and more. There was even a company called GAME that created Christmas Tinner, which is a nine-course holiday meal in a can. Needless to say, that did not take off. One item I can safely say I never thought I\u2019d find is canned cheddar cheese, but here we are. I found a canned cheddar cheese. It\u2019s called Cougar Gold Cheddar Cheese. And it\u2019s absolutely incredible.\u00a0Turns out, I\u2019m not the only one who thinks so. After going down a Cougar rabbit hole, I learned that this cheese is made at Washington State University Creamery and has quite the cult following. (I found out later that it is, in fact, not the only canned cheese out there with a die-hard base: I see you Amul!) The Gold Cheddar makes up the majority of their cheese sales, and happy buyers rave about the flavor and texture. So I bought myself a gigantic 30 oz. can\u2014which is the baseline portion\u2014and impatiently waited for its arrival.When it did show up\u2014in a room temperature box; it\u2019s shelf stable, of course!\u2014I cracked that baby open the second I got my hands on it. Loyal fans say the cheese just gets better with age, but I just couldn\u2019t wait. (Pop it in the fridge if you\u2019re not going to immediately eat it. The chill helps the cheese maintain its shape and texture, while keeping the whey and curd from separating.)\u00a0At first it looked a little dry and crumbly for my liking. I assumed it would taste very salty and maybe even slightly gritty, a far cry from the smooth, sharp, tangy cheddars I love. I thought wrong. Once I popped a piece in my mouth, it started to melt a bit, creating a creamy, silky texture, with a nice sharpness to it. It was one of the best cheddars I\u2019d ever had. It even excelled melted in macaroni and cheese, coating all my spiral noodles in a tangy, decadent finish.\u00a0And, yes, it\u2019s from a can. A can! Both shocked and pleased, I am 100% a card-carrying member of the Cougar cult now. And I think you should be, too.Cougar Gold Cheddar Cheese$25 at Washington State University$45 at Compass WinesExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendShoppingCheddarRead MorecultureI Accept Amul Cheese Exactly As It Is: Canned, Processed, and PerfectBy Priya KrishnaRecipes you want to make.
