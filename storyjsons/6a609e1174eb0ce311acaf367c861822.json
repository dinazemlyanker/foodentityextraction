Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,We\u2019ve had a string of summer-ish days in New York, which has put me firmly back into denial about fall. But while I may be biking around Brooklyn in shorts like it\u2019s August, my work brain is off in Futureland. It\u2019s thinking about next weekend\u2019s trip to Portland for Roux and a few other soon-to-be-announced events, a fun editorial package we\u2019re planning for November, the January 2020 Feel Good Food Plan, the annual Healthyish issue of Bon App\u00e9tit, and some even longer-term and more secret plans (!).It feels great\u2014and important\u2014to be thinking this far out, but it does make time speed up in a way that's disconcerting. Sometimes, in the middle of a meeting or phone call, I have to check my Google calendar just to remember what month we\u2019re in right now.And this month is a great one to be in! This week, I\u2019ve been trying to ground myself in late September by buying farmers\u2019 market apples, watching my dog pee on piles of leaves, and planning upstate escapes. And, of course, by cooking seasonally appropriate things. Last night, after a day that I described to a friend as \u201clike getting to that level of Tetris where everything is coming down way too fast,\u201d I closed my computer, cut up a kabocha squash, tossed it in honey, red pepper flakes, olive oil, and salt, and roasted it until it was soft and caramelized. I cooked a pot of farro and tossed it with walnuts, feta, and red wine vinegar, then I spooned the squash over the farro salad and ate it outside because it was still 70 degrees at 8:30 p.m.It was a seasonal mix-up, but it felt just right.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish editorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletterSquashessayRead MoreLifestyleThree Months, 200 Meals, and a LOT of Time on the RoadBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
