If I mostly cook vegetarian dishes, do I really need to waste space on an 8-inch cleaver? No way. I live in an apartment, meaning there is no room on my counters for nonsense.For a long time I owned just a standard chef\u2019s knife and a serrated knife for bread. But a couple of years ago I picked up this set of three Kyocera ceramic knives to round out the pack. Unlike knives forged with metal, ceramic blades are made from a substance called zirconia, which can be made astoundingly sharp and don\u2019t lose their edge as quickly as steel blades. You may recognize the 5.5\" chef\u2019s knife in this set from Emily Mariko\u2019s viral cooking videos on TikTok, where you\u2019ll hear the knives producing some of the purest kitchen ASMR sounds I\u2019ve ever heard. While I haven\u2019t thrown away my steel chef\u2019s knife, the Kyocera has definitely become my go-to tool for cutting just about everything. It feels comfortable and nimble in my hand; it\u2019s easy to clean thanks to the fuss-free soft plastic handle and the fact that ceramic literally cannot rust; and the razor-sharp blade makes easy work of turning mountains of veggies into tidy piles of finely chopped mise.TikTok contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Of course, it doesn\u2019t matter how sharp a knife is when you buy it if it doesn\u2019t stay that way. That\u2019s where a ceramic blade comes in handy. My first six months of cutting with this Kyocera set felt like the first few days with a freshly sharpened steel chef\u2019s knife. The Japanese zirconia Kyocera uses is nearly as hard as diamond, meaning it doesn\u2019t dull in the same way steel does. Treat the knives right and they\u2019ll feel satisfying to chop with for a long, long time. The flip side of that is that they\u2019re a bit delicate. I wouldn\u2019t recommend cutting bone-in meat or hard veggies like winter squash with a ceramic knife (here\u2019s where you need that cleaver) because you risk chipping the blade, but just about everything else is fair game\u2014so long as you\u2019re not using a glass cutting board. Ever!Kyocera 3-Piece Ceramic Knife Set$85 at AmazonThe chef\u2019s knife is worth the trio\u2019s price tag on its own. But the set also includes a slightly smaller 4.5\" utility knife, which I typically use for quicker jobs like chopping carrots or as a backup when the full-size knife is dirty, and a 3\" paring knife that\u2019s perfect for tasks like cutting stems from strawberries, peeling veggies, and slicing hunks of hard cheese. Even though the 5.5\" Kyocera ceramic knife remains my favorite, the minimalist in me has been surprised by how often I reach for the other two. Don\u2019t get me wrong, they\u2019re playing support roles, but whenever a recipe calls for precision, I\u2019m happy to have them nearby.My only real quibble with this knife set is that they require a little extra pampering. Even though I haven\u2019t had to sharpen mine for the two years I\u2019ve owned them (and they\u2019re still cutting through fruits and veggies like softened butter), if they do eventually dull, a whetstone won\u2019t be able to help. Because of their diamond-hard strength, ceramic knives require special care. If you normally send your knives out for sharpening, be sure your service can handle ceramic materials. And if you prefer to do things yourself, Kyocera also sells a special diamond knife sharpener for keeping your tools as sharp as the day you opened the box.These days I\u2019m deploying my knives to prep hearty greens, autumnal veggies for soups, and flavorful aromatics for dense, comforting braises. My trio is up to the task, and with Thanksgiving around the corner, they\u2019ll be my go-to tools for slicing up green beans and mushrooms, salad upon salad, sprouts, and sweet potatoes. Now, would you look at that, maybe I\u2019m a maximalist after all.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendShoppingCultureRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
