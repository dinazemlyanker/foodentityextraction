So long, ramen. See ya, soba.FacebookPinterestTwitterEmailPhoto by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneGO HERE: for the last udon you will ever need. Maybe you haven't thought of udon, always overlooked for sexy ramen or faithful soba, as something you could love. But at Shin, that squiggly, chewy noodle that you\u2019ve only eaten as an afterthought is better than any other you\u2019ve slurped. How did you ever ignore such beauty before? And will you ever know this kind of love again?ORDER THE: zaru udon\u2014cold noodles served with a dipping sauce\u2014for the purest experience. Or get the niku udon, with thinly sliced beef and  a soft poached egg in savory broth, for a warming option on a chilly night. But if you want to feel decadent, get the carbonara-inspired bowl that comes topped with butter, pepper, Parmesan, and a big slice of bacon tempura (that\u2019s right: bacon that's been battered, fried, and taken to a new level of crispiness).THE VIBE IS: intimate, to say the least. Shin is not much more than a sliver of a shop, with only a short counter and a couple of small tables. While you might want this interlude to last, remember that this is still a Tokyo noodle shop and you were once one of those people waiting in line outside. Don\u2019t linger too long because everyone else needs a taste too.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Sunday to Thursday from 11 a.m to 11 p.m., and Friday and Saturday from 11 a.m. to midnight. Closed during the New Year\u2019s holiday. The menu is available in Korean and English, and the staff only speaks limited English. The nearest subway station is Shinjuku.Photo by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneUdon in the making.\nPhoto by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneRamen?
