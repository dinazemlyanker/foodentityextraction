A cross between banana bread and blackout cake, it\u2019s a beautiful creation and we\u2019re so lucky to have it in our lives. It\u2019s also the perfect way to procrastinate whatever chores you had planned this weekend, which may or may not include: finally cleaning your shower curtain, commenting on celebrity Instagrams until you feel a human connection, or returning that thing you bought online that\u2019s easier to return in person.Cake is so much better than those things! Chocolaty, chocolaty cake. It looks like chocolaty is spelled wrong but nope, that\u2019s how you do it. And in this new recipe, recipe developer Molly Baz said that what began as chocolate banana bread \u201cturned into blackout cake when I decided to double down on the chocolate factor and use both cocoa powder and chopped chocolate.\u201d Double. Down. Plus, a dash of whole wheat flour brings out the nuttiness of the chocolate. Clever, clever.Get the recipe:Blackout Chocolate Banana BreadThis recipe as a cross between your very favorite banana bread and a chocolaty blackout cake.View RecipeThe sliced banana on top isn\u2019t just for Instagram, it\u2019s \u201ca thing of beauty because essentially it gets \u2018br\u00fbl\u00e9ed\u2019 in the oven,\u201d Baz said. \u201cThe entire top surface of the cake is sprinkled with raw sugar, which melts and caramelizes in the oven and lacquers the banana.\u201dThat said, it\u2019s a super flexible recipe and if you don\u2019t have whole wheat flour, you can use AP in its place. If you\u2019d prefer chocolate chips or your favorite wafers, sure. If you\u2019re more of a yogurt instead of sour cream, fiiiine. But you might be missing out on that one.A final note from Baz, if you\u2019re still on the fence: \u201cThe recipe is a straightforward quick bread, but I will say that the aroma that comes from the oven while this thing bakes is freaking intoxicating. People were swooning all week during development.\u201dSold.Exhibit A: Please note the chocolate chunks, which are important.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigExhibit B: What it looks like when you're about to dive in.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigStock up: The Test Kitchen\u2019s favorite cocoa powder and baking chocolate are Guittard. You can find the cocoa powder for $10 on Amazon and either buy a single baking bar on Jet ($3.61) or a pack of 4 on Amazon ($25) or at your local grocery.1 / 30ChevronChevronCaramel Ice CreamView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBakeCakeBanana BreadChocolateDessertRecipes you want to make.
