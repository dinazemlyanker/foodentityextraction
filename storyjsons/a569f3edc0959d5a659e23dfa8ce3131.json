But this design-district spot is just as plush\u2014we can\u2019t get enough of the classic-looking Scandi furniture, especially those chairs\u2014without the tourists.ORDER THE: lobster salad sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d topped with a panko-breaded fried egg and a teensy dollop of mayo and the herring assortment. Herring lovers get elaborate service: countless ramekins filled with several preparations of that very particular fish, plus classic accompaniments like capers, fried onion, and mayo. Overall, the menu lightens up the classics, sending out elegant plates of dark rye topped with, say, fried plaice with remoulade, or shrimps in mayo.THE VIBE IS: clubby and correct, with several generations of what look like architects, designers, and gallerists.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day for lunch (which is better), from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., and dinner (except Sunday), from 6  p.m. to 9:30 p.m.\u2014Christine MuhlkePhoto by Ditte IsagerWE ALSO LOVERestaurant Sch\u00f8nnemannGet the OG Copenhagen experience at this Indre By *sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d* destinationNomaThe next evolution of Ren\u00e9 Redzepi\u2019s destination restaurant in Refshale\u00f8enMirabellePlan a mini croissant- and yogurt-filled vacation at this caf\u00e9-like spot in N\u00f8rreboroExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
