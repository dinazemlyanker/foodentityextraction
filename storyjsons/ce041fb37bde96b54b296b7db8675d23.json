Fortunately, that age is 102.While I didn't know it at the time, my parents\u2014bless them, truly\u2014committed many \u201ccrimes\u201d against pasta when I was growing up, including adding oil to the cooking water and rinsing it with water from the tap as it sat in the colander. Drizzling oil into the water\u2014supposedly to ensure the noodles wouldn't stick together\u2014made the pasta extra slippery, while rinsing them under a running faucet was even more of a guarantee that no sauce could stick.See, rinsing noodles removes starch from their surface, thereby making it more difficult to get any kind of sauce to cling. In our household it didn't matter\u2014we ate the pasta plain (which is a story for another time, or never). But if our goal had been to marry the noodles with sauce\u2014say red pesto or brown butter or cream and peas or oil sizzled with garlic and anchovies\u2014that rinse would have been highly counterproductive.None of this is to say you should never rinse your noodles. Pray tell, what rules in life are so hard and fast? If you\u2019re making a dish that will be served chilled or at room temp\u2014think cold soba, rice noodles, pasta salad\u2014you do want to rinse so that you get toothsome (sorry) individual strands rather than one big gummy clump.Certain types of noodles benefit from a rinse in almost all applications. In her book Japanese Home Cooking, Sonoko Sakai recommends rinsing soba and udon. \u201cEven if I serve it hot,\u201d she told me, \u201cI like to rinse it in cold running water to remove the surface starch and give you a good palate feel that's not slimy.\u201d She will even go so far as to soak her soba in ice water, which firms them up for a chewier texture.So rinse sometimes, rinse wisely, but don't rinse like my parents.Cook, rinse, don't repeat:Romesco Pasta Salad with Basil and ParmesanThis pasta salad holds up well at room temperature and has a flavorful, punchy romesco sauce.View RecipeRecipes you want to make.
