Bring to a boil, then immediately reduce heat so water is at an active simmer. Cook potatoes until fork-tender, 22\u201325 minutes. Drain; let sit 5 minutes to dry.Step 2Meanwhile, whisk shallots, oil, vinegar, mustard, hot sauce, and honey in a large bowl; season dressing with salt.Step 3Add hot potatoes to dressing and let sit, tossing occasionally, until they are just warm and have soaked up some of the dressing, at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour. Just before serving, add tarragon to potato salad and toss to evenly distribute.Step 4Do Ahead: Potato salad (without tarragon) can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before serving.ChoucrouteStep 5Place a rack in upper third of oven; preheat to 400\u00b0. Drizzle oil in a large skillet. Season chicken generously with salt and arrange skin side down in a single layer in skillet. Set over medium heat and cook chicken, undisturbed, until skin is golden brown around the edges, 12\u201315 minutes. Using a stiff spatula, lift up chicken, then put it back down, still skin side down. Once chicken pieces have all released from skillet and slide around easily, continue to cook, shifting pieces as needed if browning unevenly, until skin is deeply browned, 6\u20138 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to a plate and turn skin side up. Pour off all but \u00bc cup fat from skillet.Step 6Add bacon to same skillet and cook, turning once, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes; transfer to a plate. Cook garlic in skillet, tossing occasionally, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Add thyme sprigs and juniper berries and cook, tossing, just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add sauerkraut and wine, increase heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring occasionally, until wine is almost completely evaporated, 6\u20138 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.Step 7Place sausages in a 3-qt. baking dish and pile sauerkraut over (sausages should be submerged). Arrange chicken thighs and bacon on top of sauerkraut. Pour in \u00be cup water and bake choucroute until chicken is cooked through and liquid is bubbling throughout, 25\u201330 minutes. Let cool slightly.

Easy enough to prepare, but special enough for a festive occasion.AnonymousPortland, OR12/18/2020This meal was delicious! The recipe was a little unclear about whether the sausage should be precooked especially since we used fresh bratwurst but we precooked it partway and it was fine. We were unable to get slab bacon but thick sliced bacon worked out perfectly fine as well. I will definitely make this again.AnonymousNew York12/30/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titFrenchEuropeanChicken ThighChickenPoultryKielbasaSausageMeatBaconCured MeatPotatoVegetableYukon Gold PotatoMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeDinnerRecipes you want to make.
