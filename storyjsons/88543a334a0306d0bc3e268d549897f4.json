Don't panic. There's still hope.By Alex Delany and Antara SinhaJune 7, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailAlex LauFacebookTwitterEmailAvocados seem to be working against us. When a BLT (or an ABLT, as it were) calls for slices of the green stuff, or some tortilla chips are asking for a monster bowl of guacamole, the avocados at the local grocery store are never as ripe as we want them to be. It\u2019s almost as if they know what we\u2019re going to make and are determined to make sure we don\u2019t succeed. But life is too short to accept this as truth. There are ways to make sure you have a ripe avocado when you need one. Here\u2019s how to pick out the perfect avocado at the store, and how to jumpstart the ripening process when things get dire.The road to a successful avocado experience starts at the grocery store. It\u2019s all about choosing the right avocado. And we\u2019d like to offer some general advice: It\u2019s okay to be the person who touches every piece of fruit or every vegetable. You want to find the best. Don\u2019t worry about taking too much time or getting your germs on someone else\u2019s potential pick. Find the best avocado. Do it.The best avocado will be dark. Light brown skins are signs that an avocado is not ripe. You want the deep brown, bordering on black, skins. Those will be ready to eat in the very near future. Once you find the dark ones, feel them. If the avocado is squishy, you can bet that it will be brown and oxidized when you slice it open. You should never buy a squishy avocado.Instead, look for avocados that are firm with a sight bit of give, and keep in mind when and how you\u2019ll be using them. If you\u2019re going to slice the avocado or aren\u2019t going to use it for a day or two, you want to pick a firmer one. If you\u2019re going to mash or pur\u00e9e the avocado or are going to use it that night, you want to pick a softer one. Go into the store with a good idea of when and how you\u2019ll be using your spoils. It helps.Crispy. Chicken. Bowl. With. Avocado. Yes.\nNow, what if you pick the perfect avocado and it\u2019s still not ripe enough the morning before you want to use it? What about an hour before you want to use it? If it\u2019s game time and your avocado isn\u2019t ripe enough, we\u2019re sorry. There\u2019s nothing you can do. You\u2019ll have to use an underripe avocado or no avocado at all. If it\u2019s the morning before you want to use the avocado and it\u2019s still pretty hard, don\u2019t fret. There's still hope.Have you ever heard that thing about putting underripe fruit in a brown paper bag to ripen it faster? Well it actually works! Throwing a too-firm avocado in a paper bag with a ripe banana will make its ripening process accelerate. It\u2019s all about ethylene gas and ventilation. When some fruits ripen, they give off ethylene gas (which also gives a musty, sweet odor that smells like ripe fruit). This gas is a byproduct of ripening, but it also encourages ripening in surrounding fruits. By increasing the avocado\u2019s exposure to the gas in a semi-porous bag, it will be able to breathe and ripen more quickly. Wow. Science is cool.And while science can help you to accelerate the ripening process, it's no substitute for starting with perfect avocados. You want to set yourself up for success from the start. Don\u2019t trust just anyone to grab your avocado. Find the right one. You know how.Some sliced avocado wouldn't hurt this tostada.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyAvocadoRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
