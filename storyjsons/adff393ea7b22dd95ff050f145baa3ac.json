Cashews are often used to create dairy-free condiments, but Vega's desire to work with regional harvests inspired her to use locally-grown sesame seeds instead. You can adapt this dairy-free recipe to use just about any seed or nut you have. Use it on its own as a savory dressing or blend it with Dijon mustard for a vegan aioli that\u2019s good on everything from fried potatoes and sandwiches to burgers and fish.IngredientsMakes about 3 cups\u00bccup grapeseed oil1\u00bdcups sesame seeds, divided1Tbsp.
