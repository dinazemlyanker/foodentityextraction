There was a time, long before I developed this crispy tofu recipe, I didn\u2019t really understand tofu, or soybeans in general. My sister brought some tempeh home from a particularly crunchy camp in Vermont one summer and my dad hid it in the back of the cold cut drawer until he could surreptitiously throw it away. I thought my early attempts at cooking tofu went well, but, in hindsight, I realize that's because I was cooking for hungry, vegetarian college students. For a while I abandoned all tofu except for one kind: The glazed, fried version was always an exception. Crispy, chewy, and slightly custard-y inside, it's delicious enough to make anyone forget that they don't like tofu.Making this kind of tofu doesn\u2019t take a deep-fryer or require much technique. Pressing the tofu gently between kitchen towels removes some of the excess liquid, and a shallow fry in neutral oil takes it all the way to crispy edged gold. Maple syrup makes a star appearance in a glossy soy glaze that provides takeout-joint craveability without a grease hangover.You want to start with a 12-oz. block of firm tofu and drain it very well. Firmly press a dry towel into it (but not so hard that it cracks) and cut it into blocks. In a small bowl, combine your ginger, soy sauce or tamari, maple syrup, rice vinegar, and mild chile flakes. Set that glaze aside.All it takes is \u00bd a cup of neutral oil like grapeseed or vegetable in a medium non-stick skillet to get the crispy skin you want here. Heat the oil until it's rippling across the surface. Carefully add the tofu, one piece at a time and watching out for spattering hot oil. Cook it until it's very crispy and brown underneath, three or four minutes. Carefully turn and cook on the second side.Then, here's the fun part: Holding back the tofu with a spatula or slotted spoon, pour out all the oil into a heatproof bowl, leaving the tofu in the skillet. Pour in the glaze and reduce the heat to medium. Cook until the glaze has started to thicken, then begin to baste the tofu with it with a spoon, reducing the glaze until it clings to the spoon, about four minutes.You'll want to eat this with some cooked rice, maybe some kimchi or shaved crunchy veg like daikon or carrots. Sliced scallions for sure. Crispy, glaze-y, bright, and crunchy. Not liking it just isn\u2019t an option.Get your glaze on:Crispy Tofu With Maple-Soy GlazeWhenever you\u2019re cooking tofu, here\u2019s one of our no-fail techniques: Draining the tofu, then squeezing out as much water as possible (without smashing it), is the key to the crispiest cubes.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishTofuVegetarianMaple SyrupRead Morerecipes51 Tofu Recipes for Stir-Fries, Stews, Dips, and MoreGallery51 SlidesBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
