Inspired by sorrel\u2014a festive Caribbean punch\u2014this sauce is sweet, tangy, earthy, and the perfect complement to the peppery profile of Jamaican jerk. Rum, allspice, and fresh ginger add a level of warmth and richness of flavor that is the signature of Caribbean cuisine. Serve with Jerk Turkey Sheperd\u2019s Pie.\u00a0IngredientsMakes 2\u00bd cups4Tbsp. unsalted butter12\" piece ginger, peeled, halved3whole allspice11-lb. bag fresh or frozen cranberries1\u2153cups (packed) light muscovado sugar or light brown sugar1Tbsp. plus 1\u00bd tsp. hibiscus powderPinch of kosher salt2Tbsp.

Let cool slightly.How would you rate Hibiscus Cranberry Sauce?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (6)Back to TopTriangleThe flavors here are excellent and will probably get an encore for Christmas, but the recipe is pretty off with regard to time and temperature.  Medium-low heat isn't going to make your butter foam and brown in 5-8 minutes, if it does so at all.  It sure as hell isn't going to burst cranberries in 10 minutes either.  You'll need to up the heat a fair bit if you don't want to spend all day fussing over a cranberry sauce.\n\nAlso, the recipe doesn't say anything about removing the whole allspice berries.  I hope that's an oversight, since leaving hard spices in a food with this color and consistency is a great way to hurt someone's tooth.DanCalifornia11/29/2020Best ever.. of course I can't leave anything alone so used less sugar, I had hibiscus dried pieces (I rehydrated with tiny bit of vermouth) which work better, less homogeneous sudden tart explosions which complement cranberries very well.  Also added thin slices of fresh horseradish (1cm x 2cm x 1mm).  couple drops of wasabi oil ... fantastic! Oh yeah, could't find any allspice so put in toasted fennel seedsniconelkoHonolulu11/28/2020Delicious and straightforward. I had some dried hibiscus, so I steeped it in a 1/4 cup of hot water and added that in and cooked the whole thing down until it was the consistency I wanted. I didnt have muscavado, so I did half and half dark brown sugar and white granulated sugar. The Plantation 5 year rum I used adds just a little something to make it interesting. The additional flavors from the hibiscus and rum are pretty subtle and overall this is not a recipe that should shock anyone unless they've only ever had cranberry sauce from a can. Anonymous11/25/2020This is definitely a winner and likely to go into my annual rotation. I made a half recipe for a smaller gathering, and it worked great. The butter and spices and rum flavors blended really well with the cranberry and hibiscus tang.  I discovered I had used up all my dried hibiscus, so I had to substitute ground herbal tea (Red Bone blend by Ivys Tea - hibiscus, cranberry, lemon, cayenne) that brought a bit of extra flavor for a satisfying sauce.AnonymousSacramento, CA11/23/2020Terrible. I have been a subscriber for 20+ years and this was one of the worst. I love cranberry sauce and while it sounded intriguing and I bought the hibiscus powder and muscavado sugar but I took one taste and threw it out.  MariangelaSan Francisco, CA11/22/2020Delicious! Easy to make and unique with the addition of hibiscus powder.
