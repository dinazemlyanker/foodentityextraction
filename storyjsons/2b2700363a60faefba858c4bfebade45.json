Like many classic cocktails, it has a storied (if murky, in this case) history. Some say it descends from a similar drink called \u201cEl Draque.\u201d Others argue that this rum cocktail started among Cuba\u2019s rural farm workers, and from there traveled to Havana\u2019s bars where American tourists first tried it. Among those tipplers was famously (or allegedly, depending upon who you ask) Ernest Hemingway.There\u2019s no official word on whether Hemingway actually drank mojitos and if he did, which recipe he liked, but this one keeps things classic. Muddling, or gently bruising two mint sprigs in the simple syrup before shaking helps release the herb\u2019s oils, which gives the drink its refreshing factor. Crush the leaves gently (press down, twist, repeat x 4) just until the smell of mint wafts up from the shaker. Too much muddling can turn a drink bitter. Don\u2019t worry if the mint leaves tear apart in this process, they will be strained out. Serving the drink with large ice cubes helps keep it cold and strong on the hottest of days. For the garnish, smack a fresh sprig of mint between your palms to help release its aroma before adding it to the tall Collins glass.Editor\u2019s note: This recipe was originally published in April 2016.IngredientsMakes 1 serving\u00beounce simple syrup2sprigs mint, plus more for serving2ounces white rum\u00beounce fresh lime juiceClub soda (for serving)PreparationStep 1Muddle simple syrup and 2 mint sprigs in a cocktail shaker.

Mojita made with another liquor is also really good especially when replacing clear rum with vodka.  Tequila has also made an excellent substitute in place of rum as it delivers that edge of the flavor as rum yet it has it\u2019s own unique taste.
