Kecap manis and black rice vinegar gives depth, sweetness, and acidity, bringing the other flavors of the dish into sharp focus. No kecap manis? Substitute 2 Tbsp. dark soy sauce mixed with 2 Tbsp. palm sugar or brown sugar.Ingredients4 Servings2Tbsp. granulated sugar\u00bdcup plus 2 Tbsp. black (Chinkiang) vinegar or unseasoned rice vinegar6Tbsp. light soy sauce, divided12oz. shiitake mushrooms, stems removed, thinly sliced, divided15\u201d piece ginger, peeled, cut into matchsticks, divided\u00bdcup raw cashews\u00bdcup unsweetened shredded coconut8oz. dried soba noodles2Tbsp. kecap manis (sweet soy sauce)6Tbsp. vegetable oil, divided12canned baby corn, halved crosswise8oz. green beans, trimmed, cut into thirds6small shallots, thinly slicedPreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 350\u00b0.

You can easily condense the steps by just doing all the vegetables as a stir fry and roasting of the cashews and coconut in a cast iron pan earlier in the day or the day before. Next time I will also probably do the pickling earlier so it'll come together fast and cut down on the counter-clutter.  Whatever veggies you have on hand will work - for us it was snap peas and baby cauliflower instead of corn and green beans. I liked all the ginger - cut it toothpick size almost though. It's a keeper for us.AnonymousMiami,FL2/27/2021This was such a treat\u2014deeply savoury, sweet, tangy with crispy and chewy textures throughout. My toddler and I made this together (I stir-fried his version first with just a bit of the sauce mixture), as directed. All of us (well, two adults and a toddler on lockdown together) loved the dish. Thank you!Episcopal priestUSA2/25/2021Changed it up a bit based on what we had.  Used asparagus instead of bean and cut them in half both ways, added a sliced garlic clove and shrimp.  I did not have shallots so used some red onion.  And my husband bought a small card of corn instead of small corn,  I cooked the corn with the asparagus which roasted it a little.  was amazing.   Also the sauce was a mix of soy and coco aminos.   Turned out great.AnonymousMt Dora, Florida2/13/2021We loved this, hearty and generous (5-6 servings, I'd say? leftovers heat well on stove). The pickled mushrooms are great, full of flavor (although agree with others, a little heavy on the ginger, I might cut next time and will definitely chop finer matchsticks!). To streamline dirty dishes: I did the pickled part in a small saucepan then made the separate sauce in a bowl, as directed. But I skipped the oven and used already roasted lightly-salted cashews, and just toasted the coconut in a large frying pan (sort of wok shaped). With all that done, I boiled noodles in that same pan (a little awkward, but saved a pot). Then proceeded with recipe. It was still a lot of steps, but at least fewer dishes!Hannah1/22/2021Way too many steps for flavor that didn\u2019t really payoff. I agree with another poster that there were so many servings and not much flavor. I ended up dumping half of it just due to the sheer volume of product left over. I followed recipe exactly except I had to substitute hearts of palm for the baby carrots due to availability. KatyLos Angeles, CA12/26/2020The pickled mushrooms are the cherry on top and really amp up the flavor.  More prep than I like but it was worth it in the end.  Lasted for many tasty work lunches.LTChicago12/15/2020Delicious recipe, such lovely flavours, absolutely loved the pickle with especially the ginger. \nAnd the coconut YUMMMM!\nGreat potion sizes. Loved it!! Caroline ThomasNorfolk12/6/2020So good. Definitely more than 4 servings. I had to substitute the kecap manis with soy sauce and brown sugar, still tasted delicious. I loved all the different flavor notes \u2013 toasty nuts and coconut, sour pickled mushrooms, umami sauteed mushrooms, bitey ginger, a little sweetness. I personally will go easy on the ginger next time, it was a bit overpowering since it's used in two applications. Nevertheless, I enjoyed eating this for lunch all week!BrittneyDallas, TX12/5/2020We loved this recipe. I usually follow recipes to the T the first time I make them. This was no exception. Didn't find it difficult as I did a lot of the prep ahead. I did substitute portabella mushroom as our grocer did not have shiitake. They were perfect. And speaking of mushrooms, the pickled ones were delicious. Will double that amount next time! will enter this winner into the rotation!!LoriTacoma, WA12/5/2020Very good. I toasted the cashew and coconut on the stove- easier to watch the desired level of toasting this way. I also added sugar snap peas instead of green beans because that\u2019s what I had on hand and added a diced jalape\u00f1o pepper. This makes a big batch 6-8 servings. RcmartoneHouston, TX11/21/2020Yum! This was delicious. I made it exactly as written.  I had never used black vinegar, and I thought it added a great interesting flavor. I put a lot of sriracha on mine - great combo. Erin Peshastin 11/17/2020Delicious! The combination of noodles, pickled mushrooms,  baby corn and kecap manis is an amazing combination.  I am excited to make this again AnonymousBoston MA11/10/2020Taste-OK (seems a little under-seasoned? Maybe MSG would help?) \nTime/effort-high! Lots of prep, lots of dirty dishes, lots of steps\nYield-way more than 4 servings! So far I've had about 4 servings from this but there's about 1/2 of the recipe left. \nOther-please keep it up with the vegan recipes!
