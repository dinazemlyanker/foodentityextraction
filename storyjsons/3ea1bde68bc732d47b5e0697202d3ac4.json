Flipping it over creates lovely layers. I didn't get as much colour as the pictures but it wasn't over or under done. Will definitely be making on a regular basis!KayeCape Town, South Africa9/15/2021this recipe is much like the tortilla a la Espanola.  We do not bake it but use the inversion  trick,.\nJust fine.  However you must cover this while it cooks.   Also, show the veggies, and the cheese.  \nAnother way to cook while in the wilds.....SelSFC7/7/2021Sorry Claire - if your frittata is brown you\u2019ve already failed cooking school.AnonymousSt.Louis3/7/2021Love this idea! My approach was a bit minimalist, I didn't use grains and just used a few added ingredients. I used 1 tomato, half a small shallot, and a few sprigs of sage I had leftover. I didn't bother with the flipping, just agitated the curds enough that it cooked through. I like my eggs on the softer side anyway.AnonymousColumbia, SC8/27/2019You don\u2019t need to flip the frittata. I simply cook the veggies, add scrambled eggs with a few tbsp of cream, pour, and cover on low-med heat. Covering allows the eggs to cook through. It comes out perfectly in 10 minutes!AnonymousPhiladelphia, Pa7/9/2019This recipe doesn\u2019t call for any milk or creme fraiche despite other BA guides vigorously talking about perfect ratios in your frittata... anyway, mine was a failure. Don\u2019t add too many greens and don\u2019t forget cream!AnonymousBrooklyn7/1/2018Love this waste-free recipe!
