According to her, the Fontina layer is crucial: \u201cFontina\u2019s a really wonderful cheese and quite underrated, in my opinion\u2014and it goes so well with spicy flavors.\u201d For an even faster turnaround, boil the potatoes the day before and keep them in the refrigerator until you\u2019re ready to build the tart.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

We already had both chutneys on hand (thank you, freezer!), so it cut back on the prep time a bit. Made this as a light dinner after a large Diwali lunch, and it was a hit. Next time I'd double the onions and maybe even leave out the cheese. Anonymous11/8/2021This is freaking genius! Side of tamarind chutney goes a long way! Nitya San Jose, CA10/31/2021Don\u2019t sleep on the chutney, it\u2019s needed for acid and balance. Would def prep some day before next time but absolutely worth making again. I upped the amounts on everything by a \u201cpinch, handful\u201d and used a whole Dufour puff pastry rolled out to almost a cookie sheet size to make it an entire meal with some roasted veggies. Served with some mango chutney. Delicious Amanda Owen10/31/2021Fun, beautiful and delicious! Skipped the freezer time and still turned out amazing. Will make this again and again!  Perfect for parties! B CodyAustin, Tx10/28/2021Made this over the course of two days, and man is it a lot of steps, but the result is very tasty. Sped things up by peeling and chopping the potatoes before boiling (prepped them the day before), making the cilantro chutney the day before, and caramelizing the onions the day before. One note: this recipe, along with almost every recipe on the internet, is LYING when they tell you that you can caramelize onions in ten minutes. Properly caramelized onions take at least an hour! I caramelized mine the day before making the tart along with caramelized onions for another recipe, all while I was waiting for bread to rise and also boiling the potatoes. I think that regular sauteed onions would be just fine here, though. Followed instructions for assembly and serving pretty carefully, though I used a spicy pepper fontina and omitted the date chutney. Served alongside an Indian cucumber salad and some dal, it was perfect for four people and got devoured in ten minutes. Melodie RoschmanDenver, CO10/24/2021Omg this recipe takes forever!!! Almost 4 hours, from prep to plate. For a small appetizer type dish this is way too long, in my opinion- no matter how delicious. I most likely won\u2019t make this again because of the time issue.Tess Palma-MartinezLos Angeles10/22/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titIndianSouth AsianAsianPotatoVegetablePuff Pastry DoughappetizerCilantroHerbs & SpicesRecipes you want to make.
