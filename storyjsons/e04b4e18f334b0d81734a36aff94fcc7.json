Lo\u00efc is just up the street from Elena and a bit farther down from Arthurs Nosh Bar, so it\u2019s worth stopping in for an early p\u00e9t-nat and a better-than-it-needs-to-be bar snack.ORDER: whatever visiting wine producer is pouring that night. For food, get the seafood platter, which is classic enough to satisfy and creative enough to impress; any of the pastas; or small snacks listed at the top of the menu.THE VIBE IS: chill yet a tad reserved. The intimate space (read low ceilings) encourages that kind of zen-like atmosphere; this isn\u2019t isn\u2019t the place to rage.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Tuesday to Sunday 5 p.m. to 3 a.m., with the kitchen serving food until 11 p.m. Closed Mondays. Call for reservations, which are recommended.\u2014Claire SaffitzMatthew PerrinWE ALSO LOVELe Vin PapillonLittle Burgundy\u2019s natural wine hubLarrysA natural wine bar that also serves the best breakfast in Mile EndElenaPizza and natural wines go hand in hand at this Saint-Henri pie shopExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
