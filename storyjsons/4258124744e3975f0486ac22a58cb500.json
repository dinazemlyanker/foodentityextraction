Just read all the reviews! But the thing that makes Atomix a true experience comes down to all the meticulously sourced details surrounding the food. The otherworldly ceramics. The personal collection of chopsticks generously shared. The menu presented on graphic flashcards\u2014and coveted by every diner who comes through (I have two sets!).For chef JP Park and general manager Ellia Park, who also run the more casual Atoboy just two blocks away, the presentation is about more than simply showing off their taste in the good stuff: It\u2019s about handing the mic to young Korean creatives just like them.\u201cI want Atomix to be a way to introduce young Korean talent,\u201d JP says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many channels to enter the market otherwise.\u201dHere, the couple uses their sumptuous halibut dish to show how each detail of their sleek, fine-dining restaurant contributes to that mission.1. The Food: JP blends French (brown butter) and Korean (doenjang, a fermented bean paste) staples for jjim, Atomix\u2019s steamed fish course. \u201cThe nutty flavor of the brown butter complements the deeply rooted umami of the jang,\u201d he says. The sauce is then poured over a round of silky halibut, spoon-tender hunks of butternut squash, and fatty foie gras.Take your pick from Ellia\u2019s vast collection of chopsticks.\nPhoto by Alex Lau2. The Chopsticks: \u201cWhen you go to a Japanese restaurant, you pick your own sake cup,\u201d Ellia says. \u201cI wanted to do the same.\u201d So she lets diners choose their own set of chopsticks, crafted by different Korean artists, from her personal collection of 40 sets. She picked them up over the last two years from different shops throughout Seoul.3. The Plate: Ceramicist Youme Oh, who also happens to be JP\u2019s cousin, crafted this jade-hued ceramic bowl by hand to mimic traditional Korean wares. For the rest of the plates, the Parks commissioned all South Korean makers, including up-and-comers like artist Eunyoung Kown to more established names like porcelain master Namhee Kim.Gotta catch \u2019em all.\nPhoto by Alex Lau4. The Menu: Each dish on the tasting menu comes with one of these cards: The front side features a South Korean artist\u2019s drawing inspired by JP\u2019s dish sketches (Oh made this one), while the back details every component of the dish, from the sauces to the accompanying banchan.5. The Spoon: Ellia stumbled upon these simultaneously rustic- and modern-looking spoons at Jeo Jip (\uc800\uc9d1), an old-school ceramics shop in Seoul. Each copper utensil is made by hand, hence the tiny variations.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsRestaurants + TravelDesignDish DecodedRead MorerestaurantsHow to Wash $1,000 PlatesBy Priya KrishnarestaurantsDon\u2019t Call Passerotto FusionBy Elyse InaminerestaurantsThe Long and Winding Road to Richmond's Most Ambitious New Restaurant\u2014in One DishBy Elyse InamineRecipes you want to make.
