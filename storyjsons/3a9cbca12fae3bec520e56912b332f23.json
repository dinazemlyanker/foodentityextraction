Born out of Rangoon Noodle Lab, a Bushwick pop-up that Moe and her husband, Daniel Bendjy, started in 2015, it\u2019s now one of the only Burmese eateries in all of New York City.Though she\u2019s a formally trained chef who has worked in restaurants from Hawaii to Colorado, Moe learned most of what she knows about the cuisine of her home country from her mother, a health care worker who spent most of her free moments cooking with her daughters. \u201cThere was a lot of political strife in Burma in the \u201980s and \u201990s,\u201d she recalls, \u201cso when I was a teenager, my family moved from Rangoon to the West Indies and then later to Queens, where my mom still lives.\u201dFor Moe, Rangoon the restaurant is a return to her roots\u2014and a way of introducing American diners to a surprisingly underrepresented food culture. \u201cI started this restaurant because I want people to enjoy Burmese food like how we would serve it at home,\u201d she says. Here, she breaks down all the components of her best-selling dish.The BrothThe backbone of mohinga is its labor-intensive broth, and Moe cooks up a fresh 16-quart batch daily. Catfish fillets boil for two hours in a blend of water, ginger, onion, lemongrass, turmeric, and fish sauce, which, once thickened with toasted rice flour, forms a velvety texture. Then she removes the fish, smashes it by hand into a paste, saut\u00e9s it till it\u2019s dry and toasty, and adds it back into the broth for maximum fishy flavor.The NoodlesMoe would love to make all her noodles by hand like she used to back home, but the process is too time-consuming to juggle with running a restaurant. Instead, she buys extra-thin dried Vietnamese rice noodles\u2014Bamboo Tree is her brand of choice. \u201cIn Burma we don\u2019t like our noodles to be chewy at all,\u201d she says. \u201cWe like them soft and a little sticky.\u201d To achieve this perfect texture, the noodles are cooked separately and topped with a ladleful of soup just before serving.The Lotus RootA serious crunch-factor is needed to offset the softness of the noodles and broth, and traditionally that would mean slices of banana stem, the fibrous flower stalks of a banana plant. But despite the prevalence of the fruits they bear, finding the stems themselves isn\u2019t easy in New York. So Moe uses lotus root instead, boiled and sliced thin: \u201cIt soaks up the flavor and color of the soup, brings a little added sweetness, and it\u2019s pretty!\u201dThe Shallot FritterEvery bowl of mohinga needs its deep-fried crown. \u201cAt the stalls in Burma, there are always a variety of fritters to choose from,\u201d says Moe. \u201cSince I was a child I\u2019ve always chosen the shallot ones. The sweetness and crunch pair so well with the mohinga\u2019s rich broth.\u201d She supersizes her fritters for dramatic effect, perching one on the edge of each bowl like a crispy, lacy doily. The batter is made from chickpea flour, a gluten-free Burmese staple.The ToppingsMoe always serves the soup along with ramekins filled with lime wedges, fish sauce, and toasted chile flakes. This is the classic trio of toppings you\u2019d find on the table at any mohinga stall in Burma, and you\u2019re supposed to use all three, adjusting the ratios to your exact liking. \u201cWe call these components chin ngn satt\u2014which means \u2018sour, salty, spicy,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThe combination is the key to Burmese flavor.
