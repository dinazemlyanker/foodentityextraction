For centuries, trade routes have been carved, fortunes made, and people subjugated all for spice\u2014nutmeg and black pepper, saffron and cardamom, paprika and cinnamon.That fraught history means it\u2019s worth taking a second to pause the next time you find yourself re-upping on coriander. Flavor is certainly one reason to take care with where you source your spices. Depending on the type and whether they\u2019re whole or ground, spices can lose their potency as quickly as six months. A jar of ground cumin could conceivably have been sitting on a grocery store shelf for several months, its valuable volatile oils evaporating all the while. Your supermarket cinnamon is also likely to be cassia cinnamon instead of Ceylon cinnamon\u2014which isn\u2019t bad, just...less good\u2014and if you\u2019re not thoroughly scrutinizing labels, you could wind up with artificial vanilla flavoring instead of pure vanilla extract.Jump Ahead to Our FavoritesSpice SourcersSpice BlendersSpice ShopsBut knowing where your spices come from is important for other reasons as well. Most spices still reach your kitchen in much the same way they did when the Dutch East India Company was operating in the 17th century\u2014they were grown or foraged by someone in a country close to the equator, and they have passed through multiple hands before reaching their final destination. Because there are so many brokers, traders, processors, and other middlemen, those supply chains generally lack transparency. And with spice being a catchall term encompassing scores of different crops grown in scores of different countries, each individual supply chain comes with its own challenges. Are the foragers making a living wage? Have the spices been adulterated by middlemen? Is climate change forcing farmers off their land?Spice, glorious spice!\nPhoto by Laura Murray, Food Styling by Kat BoytsovaYour best bet is to buy from a company with the shortest supply chain possible\u2014ideally, one that sources spices straight from their origins and sells them directly to you. By cultivating personal relationships with their farmers and foragers, these companies not only ensure that their customers are getting flavorful, fresh, high-quality spices, but also that their suppliers are being paid fairly. For spice growers, many of whom live in some of the poorest countries in the world, a trusted partnership with an ethical importer can mean a pathway to economic security.Below we\u2019ve rounded up some of the best spice stores online\u2014from companies that source directly from farmers to artisan blenders who concoct complex spice mixes to shops where you can compare Kampot and Tellicherry peppercorns. Just like with coffee, we recommend buying whole spices and then grinding them at home for maximum freshness and flavor, but many of these sources will sell you ground spices as well, should you prefer.Spice SourcersDiaspora Co.Mumbai-born, California-based Sana Javeri Kadri works directly with Indian and Sri Lankan smallholder farmers to source heirloom, single-origin turmeric, chiles, cardamom, pepper, and more. Our editors love this company not only for its selection of spices (try the chai masala), but also for its commitment to ethical and transparent supply chains.Diaspora Co.Shop NowBurlap & BarrelLike Diaspora Co., Burlap & Barrel cofounders Ethan Frisch and Ori Zohar source their heirloom spices\u2014including senior editor Sarah Jampel\u2019s favorite cinnamon\u2014from smallholder farms and farmer cooperatives. By cutting out the middleman, Frisch and Zohar ensure that farmers earn a higher price for their product. Burlap & Barrel\u2019s direct relationships with suppliers means that farmers can focus on quality rather than quantity and know that they have a partner who will reward their efforts.Photo courtesy Burlap & BarrelBurlap & BarrelShop NowHeray SpiceIn 2013, Mohammad Salehi sought asylum in the United States after his tenure as a translator for the U.S. Army made it unsafe for him to remain in Afghanistan. He founded Heray Spice because he wanted people \u201cto know that there\u2019s more to my country than war.\u201d His company sources saffron from farming families in Herat Province, where Salehi grew up, and donates a portion of its profits to local educational charities.Heray SpiceShop NowSpicewallaJames Beard\u2013nominated chef Meherwan Irani sells both carefully curated individual spices and culinary spice sets, including a Kitchen Essentials pack of 18 spices beloved by contributing editor Amanda Shapiro.

Their rust-colored shawarma blend is excellent on both meats and veggies, and their kafe hawaij\u2014a warming blend of cardamom, cinnamon, clove, and ginger meant to be added to coffee\u2014has the flavor profile, in New York Shuk\u2019s words, of Middle Eastern pumpkin spice.Leetal AraziNew York ShukShop NowLoisaIf you\u2019re looking for organic saz\u00f3n and adobo blends free of artificial colorings or additives, look no further than this NYC brand, which sells Latin spices in addition to jarred sofrito.

Serve it with man\u2019oushe and olive oil.Photo by Isa Zapata, food styling by Micah MortonZ&ZShop NowSpice ShopsThe Spice HouseRuth and Bill Penzey Sr. opened the Spice House in 1957, a time when garlic was still considered \u201cexotic\u201d by much of America. (As you\u2019ll see, many of the best spice stores online can trace their lineage to the Penzeys, in some way or another.) Their daughter Patty ran the business until 2018, when it was purchased by business partners with backgrounds in finance and tech. If you\u2019re looking to buy spices online without stopping at Heray Spice for saffron, Diaspora Co. for turmeric, and Burlap & Barrel for cinnamon, the Spice House\u2019s huge selection of everything from lavender to Mexican oregano should have you covered.The Spice HouseShop Now at The Spice HousePenzeys SpicesBill Penzey Jr. followed in his parents\u2019 footsteps and started his mail-order spice business in 1986.
