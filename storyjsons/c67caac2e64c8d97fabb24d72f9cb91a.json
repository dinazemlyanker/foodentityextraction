I never would have thought about that!\nThanks Molly and BA for this delicious Indian treat! Keep em coming!AnonymousBoston8/9/2018What the ?\nGet Off Your High Horse - tandoor is a type of oven and not a specific mix.\nThe term tandoor /t\u0251\u02d0n\u02c8d\u028a\u0259r/ refers to a variety of ovens, the most commonly known is a cylindrical clay or metal oven used in cooking and baking. The tandoor is used for cooking in Southern, Central and Western Asia, as well as in the South Caucasus. The heat for a tandoor was traditionally generated by a charcoal or wood fire, burning within the tandoor itself, thus exposing the food to live-fire, radiant heat cooking, and hot-air, convection cooking, and smoking by the fat and food...AnonymousTexas8/8/2018\"up to 24 hours\"? What?! Any informed recipe-writer or Indian cook knows that a citrus marinade denatures proteins in chicken past about 8 hours, to a point of mush. It becomes ceviche chicken at 24 hours in a citrus bath. Overnight acidic soaking has been debunked over and over. And where's the kasoori methi or Kashmiri red chili or chaat masala or cumin or coriander? You mention garam masala but that alone doesn't constitute a tandoori mix, despite having elements of one. Sure there are variations, but this isn't one. The writer and editor of this recipe are under-informed and discrediting BA's otherwise tempting recipes. Indian dishes and adaptations of them should make BA more often, but please know what you're talking about first.What the?8/1/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titIndianSouth AsianAsianChicken WingChickenPoultryFresno ChileChileVegetableYogurtOther IngredientsEasyStarterMainGluten-FreeNut-FreeKetoGrillingSuper BowlFourth Of JulyMemorial DayLabor DayDinnerRecipes you want to make.
