As simple as it seems when you\u2019re housing them from an ice-filled dish at a party, a lot goes into constructing the perfectly poached shrimp cocktail. I know because I\u2019ve tried every method, which means I did the work for you, so you can sit back and relax and read the rest of this article knowing there\u2019s a solid recipe at the end. It\u2019s not difficult to make, but there are a few key points to bear in mind, and you\u2019ll never suffer a mediocre shrimp cocktail again.Number one: High quality shrimp. It means everything. Most of the shrimp we get in the U.S.  is previously frozen, and that\u2019s A-OK. If you have access to fresh shrimp, by all means snag that good stuff. But if not, look for \u201cwild-caught,\u201d which tend to have better and cleaner shrimpy flavor than those raised in farmed environments. Or at least look for \u201csustainably farmed\u201d whenever possible; the fresher the better, duh.Better shrimp = better shrimp cocktail.\nPhoto by Alex LauOkay enough with the preachy-preach. Next up: Shell On. Shrimp that is poached in its shell tastes a gajllion times better than the stuff poached with the shell removed. The shells protect that sweet tender flesh from getting rubbery and they give flavor to the poaching liquid, both extremely important details. You\u2019ll remove those shells later.Third point: Salt, sugar, lemon. That\u2019s all you\u2019ll add to your water to create a poaching liquid that will season and flavor the shrimp in the brief time it spends in it (1\u00bd to 5 minutes, depending on the size). I tried many different versions of poaching liquid\u2014including a 30-minute simmered court-bouillon packed with herbs and aromatics\u2014and ultimately determined that it\u2019s the salt and the sugar and that hint of lemon for brightness that are doing the heavy lifting here. The shrimp spend so little time in the poaching liquid that all the fuss of making a stock really doesn\u2019t pay off.Make some Bloody Marys, make it a shrimp cocktail party.\nAnd lastly: Ice bath. Shrimp can overcook in an instant. Which is why we shock them with ice, to stop the cooking. Pro-trick here is to add ice to your poaching liquid once the shrimp are cooked, so that they can cool down in the liquid they cooked in. More time in that yummy salty lemony water = more flavor picked up by your shramps.Get the recipe:BA\u2019s Best Shrimp CocktailShrimp cocktail is all about the shrimp: big, fat, perfectly cooked gorgeous shrimp.
