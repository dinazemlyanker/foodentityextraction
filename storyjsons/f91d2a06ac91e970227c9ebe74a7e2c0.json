And if that doesn\u2019t work, we\u2019ve got a recipe.Focaccia is an olive oil-rich Italian bread we can\u2019t decide is better described metaphorically as a sponge or a springy mattress. It\u2019s crispy and golden on the top and bottom crusts, and inside, it has an airy crumb (meaning there are tons of air holes, big and small, that squish in the best way possible). Most of the actual work takes place in the stand mixer, while the rest requires a study in patience as you wait for the dough to develop overnight.Break me off a piece of that.\nPhoto by Alex LauHere\u2019s how our recipe by Claire Saffitz breaks down. The day before you want bread, mix flour and water in your Kitchenaid/stand mixer so you can stare at it contemplatively without getting doughy fingers. Let that rest in the bowl while you create up a bubbling mixture of yeast/sugar/water, then add that to dough in the stand mixer, add salt, and continue mixing until it\u2019s smooth, stretchy dough.This focaccia dough is wetter than a lot of other bread doughs, so don\u2019t freak out and start Googling and second-guessing everything while falling prey to targeted ads for those clogs you kinda want. The dough should be very sticky but not as thin as batter. Let that rise for 2 hours in an oiled bowl somewhere warm and cozy.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Next, you\u2019ll fold the dough a few times in an oiled 18\" x 13\" sheet pan with 1-inch sides\u2014this recipe is perfectly tailored to this size. Oil your hands before doing all of this, too, and then thank us later for your moisturized cuticles. Let it rest a few minutes to allow the stretchy gluten to relax\u2014the spandex of bread\u2014and then pull the dough into a rectangle shape.That\u2019s it for day 1. The sheet pan goes into the fridge overnight.Whyyyyyyy?! For flavor. By tossing the dough into the fridge, we\u2019re slooooowing down the fermentation process. Instead, the yeast can chill and develop this nutty, chewy flavor that\u2019s noticeably complex. Otherwise you\u2019d have focaccia that tastes like flavorless white flour. We want that fragrant, warm, yeasty flavor. So wait it out!The next day you\u2019ll let it warm up and rise to the top of the sheet pan while the oven gets HOT. 450\u00b0, people. That way the bread nearly fries in all of the oil, creating that crispy edges we swoon for like focaccia groupies. Before it goes in the oven, though, you\u2019ll drizzle olive oil all over (whatever you have as long as it\u2019s extra virgin, not the $$$ fancy stuff) to anticipate the crispy crunch crust. Then oil your hands again and play the piano on the soft dough, creating dimples all over, an inch apart or so. Welcome to Planet Focaccia, earthlings. Final move: Sprinkle a generous amount of Maldon salt (have you embraced bucket life yet, btw?) all over. 25\u201335 minutes later and you\u2019re golden\u2014literally golden brown. And blessed with a ton of focaccia to rest your weary head upon.Photo by Alex LauOh, obviously it\u2019s best eaten fresh, but it stores well for a few days, in which case you can revive it in the toaster oven, adding a drizzle of oil if you want. You can slice and freeze it too, then throw it in the toaster straight from frozen.We like to dip this classic, salt + oil focaccia in soup, sauces, or use it as awesome sandwich bookends. It\u2019s not pizza\u2014the fewer accoutrements the better. But you can get artsy and doctor it up with these toppings after you dimple the dough:Thinly sliced garlic and rosemary leavesThinly sliced lemonThinly sliced red onion (see a theme here?)Parmesan\u2014but better added after it\u2019s baked so it won\u2019t get that burnt bitter tasteYou tell me!
