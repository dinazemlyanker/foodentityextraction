I'm Blaming Your ButterKeep it cool.By Jesse SparksApril 6, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Michael Graydon and Nikole Herriott, Food Styling by Susie Theodorou, Prop Styling by Kalen Kaminski\u00a0FacebookTwitterEmailThis article is part of the Basically Guide to Better Baking, a 10-week, 10-recipe series designed to help you become a cooler, smarter, more confident baker.My grandmother Evelyn Watkins (good ol\u2019 gram) was a spitfire of a baker who regularly churned out pies at the drop of a hat. So when she\u2019d come to Houston to watch my siblings and me during our summer vacations, she\u2019d make pies with her grandkids. She would lean over me, take my hands in hers, and press them into a soft pillow of pie dough, cursing the invasive heat of the sweltering summer.One time, as she felt our soggy, sticky dough that was basically begging for a cooler clime, she let slip: \u201cYou can\u2019t do sh!t if your dough\u2019s too fuck!ng hot.\u201d Originally I thought it was my fault\u2014that I hadn\u2019t  formed the perfect dough quickly enough\u2014but really, it was always about the butter.When it comes to pie dough, keeping the butter as cold as possible is the key to achieving that gold-medal worthy flakiness. Once you\u2019ve rolled out and folded your pie dough, those distinct bits of butter will steam as the dough bakes, creating the pockets of air that puff up into distinct layers. If the butter is too warm, it will combine too well into the flour, making the dough hard to work with and the final crust tough or cracker-like. If you\u2019ve had pie crust problems, chances are the butter\u2019s to blame. Here\u2019s how to keep it under control:Start with cold butter, straight from the fridge. And if you\u2019re using European butter, which is higher in fat and softer at room temp, Sohla El-Waylly recommends cubing it and freezing it until it\u2019s firmed up.Consider the temperature of your kitchen. It could fluctuate depending on where you live, if you have air conditioning, and the time of year. You\u2019ll want to work extra quickly (and be extra cautious) if you\u2019re working in a warm environment like Houston in the summer.Chill your tools. Make space in the fridge or freezer for your mixing bowl, bench scraper, and baking vessel, be it a pie dish or a sheet pan.When a recipe calls for water, it should be icy-cold and definitely not from the warm side of the tap.Give the dough ample time to chill throughout the process.  Pastry pro Lisa Ludwinski, owner of Sister Pie in Detroit, freezes her dough at several points during her process. Even if you\u2019re not following her recipe, it will help give your butter a stint in the freezer as soon as it starts to feel tacky, warm, or mushy. When in doubt, opt to let it chill the dough in the freezer for up to 20 minutes before continuing to work (keep in mind that it might need to rest for a few minutes at room temperature to become pliable again).Remember to move quickly and efficiently. Get your flour and water measured before the butter comes out of the fridge, lest you start cursing like an impassioned grandmother. And don\u2019t be too precious as you smash the butter into the flour\u2014it\u2019s better to go quickly than to be exacting,Your freezer is your friend.\nIf your doughs feel warm or tacky after you\u2019ve lined the pie dish or shaped the galette, stick it in the freezer or fridge until it\u2019s firm and cool to the touch before you bake.And just like that you\u2019re ready to bake a pie that would make your my grandmother proud, which is absolutely a feat in and of itself.Get baking:Triple-Threat Onion GaletteNot just a clever name, this savory tart combines three alliums (scallions, garlic, and onion) for maximum flavor and crispy-jammy texture. The key to the flaky crust is to move fast! Rolling and folding the dough while the butter is still cold creates distinct layers of butter and flour that will steam apart during baking, making the crust light and flaky.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasically BakingRecipes you want to make.
