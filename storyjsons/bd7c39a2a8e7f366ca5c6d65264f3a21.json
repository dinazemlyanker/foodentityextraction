Next up, Tiffany Hopkins makes the case for Jane Bakes cookies.Judge me if you will, but I initially bought these hazelnut and dark chocolate cookies from Jane Bakes because of their fiber content. We could all use a little help, OKAY? Made with just a handful of ingredients, these cookies are not only high in fiber, but also lower in carbs than standard store-bought cookies. I\u2019ve tried a lot of healthyish snacks, and let\u2019s be honest, they usually aren\u2019t as good as their sugar-and-saturated-fat-filled counterparts. So I wasn\u2019t expecting these to be delicious, but surprise! Their rich, nutty flavor and delicate, melt-in-your mouth texture had me hooked.Photo by Isa ZapataJane Bakes Hazelnut and Dark Chocolate Cookies$27 at Amazon (3-Pack)Most store-bought chocolate-speckled cookies fall into two camps: Team Crispy (Tate\u2019s) and Team Chewy (Pepperidge Farm). But Jane Bakes treats are something different altogether, sitting somewhere between a crumbly chocolate chip cookie and a buttery shortbread\u2014sort of like, you know, those cookies. With a small bite-size shape, they\u2019re perfectly tender, have just the right amount of sweetness, and embody the perfect butter-to-chocolate-to-nut ratio. They\u2019re the captain of Team Delicate.So what, exactly, makes them healthy? The base of these cookies consists of a mixture of 100% organic whole wheat flour fortified with something called Hi-Maize, a fiber-packed resistant starch that\u2019s made from corn. The cookies get their sweetness from Whey Low, a low-glycemic blend of natural sugars, including fructose (fruit sugar) and lactose (milk sugar). While I don\u2019t know if a \u201chealthy cookie\u201d actually exists, I can vouch for the deliciousness of Jane Bakes offerings.I immediately regretted buying only one pack\u2014a mistake I haven\u2019t made since. These days I always keep a couple sleeves of Jane Bakes cookies on deck. Sometimes it\u2019s the whiskey and rye chocolate chip flavor or the maple pecan variety, but the hazelnut and dark chocolate cookies are incredibly hard to beat. I can\u2019t be sure that eating a cookie a day will keep the doctor away, but it\u2019ll sure keep me happy.Jane Bakes Maple Pecan Cookies$27 at Amazon (3-Pack)Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make.
