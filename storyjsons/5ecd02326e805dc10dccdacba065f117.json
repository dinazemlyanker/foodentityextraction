We asked 80 of the most interesting people we know to reveal the local spots they love the most.The first time I walked into Trina\u2019s Starlite Lounge in Somerville, Massachusetts, I immediately noticed two things. One, that whoever owned this place shared my favorite style of decor: anti-minimalism. The other was a small fridge behind the bar covered in those clunky, colorful magnetic letters I used to get hooked on phonics back in grade school. Every day the fridge wisely spits out platitudes and life\u2019s bittersweet truths for patrons to enjoy alongside their $4 \u2019Gansetts\u2014things like \u201cA job is more than a paycheck\u2014it\u2019s also a place where you cry in the bathroom\u201d; \u201cI have to plug my phone into the charger so much I basically have a landline again\u201d;  and, serving up some stone-cold nostalgia, \u201cThe year is 2015. Trap Queen is playing on the aux cord. Obama is President. Life is good.\u201dThis chicken. So good.\nPHOTO BY PAT PIASECKITrina\u2019s isn\u2019t the most harmonious space\u2014the walls are jammed full of old-school beer signs and a plaque proclaiming this to be \u201cthe friendliest place in town.\u201d The greeter stand is illuminated by the same kind of library desk lamp that now permanently occupies suburban basements across America. There\u2019s a disco ball above the bar where plaid flannel shirts and local yuppies in rumpled Patagonia Better Sweaters drink off their weeks. College kids who can\u2019t spring for the $14 cocktails down the block huddle up in the booths to devour plates of magical fried chicken and Ritz cracker\u2013topped mac and cheese. But Trina\u2019s is so earnest in its quest to serve as home base for devoted locals who rarely ever drink outside of Cambridge or Somerville that it\u2019s impossible to envision it ever being any other way.At some point in the night, you\u2019ll realize that it\u2019s actually the fridge that ties this all together. It blesses awkward first dates with a conversation starter, and its daily mantra sets the tone for the pregamers and the postgamers who wear different levels of optimism or exhaustion depending on how late it is.Vibes. It's all about the vibes.\nPHOTO BY PAT PIASECKIThe more jaded (read: too sober) will write the fridge off as a gimmick and complain about the less-original messages that have already made the rounds on Pinterest or Twitter (\u201cJanuary was a tough year, but we made it\u201d), but those folks are missing the point. Trina\u2019s isn\u2019t trying to reinvent the wheel. It\u2019s a neighborhood watering hole that makes you wonder: Does everyone here somehow know each other? And then return to your plate of tater tots, which taste exactly as good as they did at the end of your most ruinous nights out in college. \u201cIt\u2019s officially \u2018once I\u2019m here I ain\u2019t going back out season\u2019\u201d the fridge declared one night in January.
