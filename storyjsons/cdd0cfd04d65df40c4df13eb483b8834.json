I am allergic to peas so I made a version with eggplant instead. Also used ground pork because that's what I had. Would make again!AngelaPalo Alto, CA2/15/2022Tasted great and left the green beans still very crunchy. I enjoyed the live video cook-along. It was well-paced, I didn't feel rushed at all.TerriCictoria, BC Canada6/15/2021Two of us made this recipe side-by-side last night during the cook-along live. All the diners liked it - but it wasn't fantastic. I should have read the reviews and doubled the sauce. We found the dish a little drab as the sauce didn't give enough oopmh.   The flavors were very good, but because there wasn't enough sauce, it ate dryJanisBoca Raton, FL6/11/2021Haven't tried the recipe yet, but just wanted to comment on the \"chef\" making the recipe on your video.  He's a nice looking guy, but I hope his cooking is better than his diction.  If it were not for subtitles and visuals, I couldn't understand some of his mumbling and sloppy diction.DUH!Brooklyn, NY6/4/2021I make it all the time, I just double most of the ingredients for the curry paste. Super tasty and easy! Sarah New York 4/15/2021I really liked this dish, super easy and delivious. Would probably add more veggies next time.Mayrav EstrinBrooklyn, NY3/4/2021\nReally delicious! As it was recommended to double the sauce, I did. Loved how easy it was to make and the overall taste. You can definitely switch up the vegetables, as I couldn't get my hands on snap peas, green aspergus also did the trick! \nWould highly recommend!! LorrainebrennIstanbul2/2/2021I used to be a research scientist, and this recipe gave me war flashbacks of one of the worst experiments I have ever run. That experiment was a cauchemar because I killed my instincts and followed the instructions on a protocol I'd inherited. \n\nThe problems started with the chicken: \"Velvet it, Sharma!\" every instinct screamed, but I stuck to the protocol. \n\"Introduce some acid, a**hole!\" I railed at me. But, I stuck to the protocol. \n\"How about some heat, you bland-a** b*tch-burger!\" I berated the self. But, I stuck to the protocol. \n\"You know you like the sauce thiccc, so what the f*ck?\" I implored my person. But, I stuck to the protocol. \n\nThe end result is a sauce so sapless and beige that it might as well be flat miso-flavoured La Croix, grey beans, limp and lachrymose, as if dosed with Canal Street sildenafil and a chicken so chewy that you might feel like a ruminant who a made a meal out of an avian friend because times is tough. \n\nI don't blame Chris Morocco, no. There's no accounting for taste, after all. I blame myself for sticking to the protocol. Like in that catastrophe of an experiment, I knew what I should have done but I (you guessed it) stuck to someone else's protocol. A mistake I shan't be making again. \n\nInterferonGuy 1/22/2021Love this recipe!! I didn't have any miso so I subbed with hoisin sauce and it was delicious!! I also doubled the sauce and added 1 tsp of corn starch to the 1/2 cup of water at the end. It made the sauce thicker and just perfect over rice.DebbyLos Angeles, CA11/6/2020Great recipe! Completely agree with other reviewers re: doubling the sauce but that's the only modification! Definitely double the sauce! Otherwise, delicious and easy!Andrew EckertNew York City10/23/2020Love this recipe, \nEasy and delicious, for Adults and kids! I didn't have have any of the green beans but substituted it with asparagus and broccoli. Amazing! Only thing I would change is double the sauce! AnonymousIstanbul10/17/2020We liked this recipe! It is super flexible, and it was a great way to get a lot of greens! We doubled the sauce as some comments suggested. Next time, we will thaw the peas in the microwave in the water that we\u2019ll eventually add in - it took a long time for the curry to heat back up and reduce once we added in the cold water. Make sure to include the sugar, as it helps to brown/caramelize the chicken more quickly, and without it you will over-cook it. AnonymousBoise10/10/2020Love this recipe. I swap chicken out and add steamed-then-seared carrots for a vegan version. AnonymousNew Jersey9/24/2020A pound of chicken for two people?LillypillyAustralia 8/7/2020Loved this recipe! While we were eating it we discussed all the variations we could do to it. Also going to double the sauce because we like it saucey.
