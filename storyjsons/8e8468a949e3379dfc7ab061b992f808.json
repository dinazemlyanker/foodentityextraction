It can be a dress-it-up or dress-it-down situation\u2014packed with cheddar to bring that familiar oozy saltiness, or decked out with a mac and cheese topping (the recipe is in my book Family and it\u2019s a serious game changer), or simply served with croutons. This unintentionally vegan version is pared back yet doesn\u2019t lack complex flavors or indulgence. Cashew cream adds body (you could actually use it to thicken any type of vegetable soup) and creates a cloudlike consistency. \u2014Hetty MckinnonThis is part of our meal planning package, where one recipe can become three quick weeknight meals. Use the rest of your batch of cashew cream to make Roasted Carrots and Chickpeas With Herby Cashew Cream or Creamy Cashew Udon With Crispy Mushrooms.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

If your broccoli has a long stem, peel tough outer layer, then slice stem \u00bc\" thick.Step 4Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Cook leek, stirring often and reducing heat if needed to avoid leek taking on any color, until softened slightly, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and fennel seeds and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add broccoli and broth and increase heat to medium-high. Cover pot with a lid, setting it slightly askew to allow steam to escape (this will help the broccoli maintain its vibrant green color). Bring to a boil and cook until broccoli is tender, 8\u201310 minutes.Step 5Working in batches if needed, transfer broccoli mixture to a blender or food processor and add salt, \u00bc cup dill, and \u00bd cup cashew cream.

Top with a few dill sprigs and season with pepper.How would you rate Broccoli and Cashew Cream Soup?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (6)Back to TopTriangleI haven\u2019t tried this yet, but sounds delicious \nI would really appreciate you posting nutrition information with recipes \nThank you Jojostpete Florida 1/30/2022I'm surprised this one has a relatively low rating - I thought it was well-balanced! I am a fan of fennel though, and I did add some extra garlic. Make sure you're using a broth you really like (I've been on a Better than Bouillon kick)MichellePittsburgh, PA11/20/2021Cashew cream definitely saves this soup. I used half the fennel seed and garlic and it\u2019s still largely washed out with tannins and alliums. Cutting with dill is essential. \n\nI\u2019d make this again as an immunity booster but not a crowd pleaser. Cambro Vancouver WA9/24/2021I enjoyed this recipe. The cashew cream does add a velvety texture and rich flavor. I used fresh fennel instead of seeds so mine fennel was the right amount. My local grocery was out of leaks so I used scallions and added a couple small potatoes for texture. I loved it and haven\u2019t had broccoli soup in years. It was a treat. My only negative was I kept forgetting to put the lid so stream could escape preserving the green color. Oh well it tasted really good and worth making it a regular monthly meal. Paris Eden Los Angeles, California 9/15/2021It has potential but to much fennel seeds I will recommend to use one tsp. Or lessCarlosAustin Texas9/13/2021I like the vegan approach to this soup, I can get lactose free cream,but using cashew is greatGillianToronto Ontario Canada9/6/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titBroccoliVegetableSoupVeganVegetarianDinnerRecipes you want to make.
