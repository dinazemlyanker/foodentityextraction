Pepperoni\u2014that familiar star of late-night dollar-slice pizza everywhere\u2014stains the rice a deep red and gives it a nostalgic flavor. Letting the rice sit for a full 20 minutes after coming off the heat is key to finishing the cooking process. This is a great group project\u2014gather around the table to clean, shell, and fill a mountain of mussels and you will be rewarded with a perfectly poppable party-ready bite\u2014or 10.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Cook garlic, stirring often, until golden, about 2 minutes. Add parsley, mussels, wine, and red pepper flakes; stir to coat. Cover and cook, stirring halfway through, until mussels open, about 4 minutes. Uncover and transfer opened mussels to a large bowl with a slotted spoon. If any mussels are still closed, cover pot again and cook until opened, about 1 minute more. Transfer open mussels to bowl; discard any that remain closed. Chill mussels until ready to assemble. Strain cooking liquid; discard solids. Measure out 3 cups mussel stock; add water if short. Reserve pot.Rice and AssemblyStep 2Heat oil in reserved pot over medium-low. Cook pepperoni, stirring often, until some fat has cooked out and oil is bright red, about 4 minutes. Add anchovy, tomato paste, and oregano. Cook, stirring often, until tomato paste darkens slightly, about 3 minutes. Add onion and garlic and cook, still stirring often, until onion is soft, about 4 minutes.Step 3Increase heat to medium-high and add wine. Cook, stirring, until wine is evaporated, about 3 minutes. Stir in rice and reserved mussel stock.

Line 2 large rimmed baking sheets with lightly crumpled foil (to help keep mussel shells upright). Remove top shells from mussels (pry apart and twist at the hinge). Using a paring knife, loosen meat from bottom shells. Spoon 1 Tbsp. pepperoni rice over each mussel and shape into a mound. Divide mussels, stuffed side up, between baking sheets. Bake until warmed through, 5\u20138 minutes. Remove from oven; heat broiler.Step 6One baking sheet at a time, broil mussels on upper rack until tops are golden brown, 5\u20137 minutes (watch closely; broilers vary dramatically in power).Step 7Transfer mussels to a platter and drizzle with aioli.

A basic and reader-friendly feature such as reading reviews should not be an IT challenge. It's how BA will lose readers. I can open this review but not the one for stuffing biscuits from the October issue. I won't make without reading others' experiences making them.zoomite11/1/2021Regarding the readers inability to read reviews, Bon Appetit's website has been awful for months. I am a 30 year subscriber and user of Bon Appetit. I have over 700 saved recipes and I am no longer able to view my \"folders.\" Recipes are only listed in no specific order now. I've reached out to the IT department several times with no resolution. So.....no wonder you cannot read reviews. Hopefully the website will get it together. The New York Times recipe website is looking better and better.Joni10/31/2021Why aren't the reviews showing?  Makes me nervous to try the recipe.
