Let us help you pick.By Karen YuanAugust 13, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Emma Fishman, styling by Allie WistFacebookTwitterEmailOkay, yes, it\u2019s August, but summer isn\u2019t over yet. You\u2019ll have to pry it out of our sweaty, mosquito bite-ridden hands. We\u2019ve been keeping our ovens off and hanging out in the shade, and, like everyone and their literal mother it seems, drinking booze out of cans.The Cool Drinks Economy is inflated with canned beverages in various colors, flavors, and ~vibes~. So which one should you choose? The BA staff is here to help with a list of our favorite drinks in a can, including some nonalcoholic picks, plus the ideal scenarios to consume them.Check them out, track them down, and bring them to whatever summer activities you\u2019re squeezing in before it\u2019s sweater weather again. And remember: It\u2019s not the size of your cooler, it\u2019s what you fill it with that counts.Photo by Emma FishmanFor the Beach, Post-Salty Ocean DipI am a fiend for sparkling water with the juice of actual fruits in it. And now, I have a new love interest in Sanzo, which features Asian fruits like calamansi, mango, and the undeniable frontrunner, lychee. I like to pack a cooler full of these babies for the beach, as they are not only incredibly refreshing when frosty but excellent for de-salting your mouth after an overlong dip in the ocean. \u2014Hilary Cadigan, culture editorFor Wooing a Date With Your Elegant MystiqueNothing says \u201cI am a person of sophistication and mystery unbound by societal norms\u201d like this canned beverage from Empirical, an extremely out-of-the-box distillery in Copenhagen founded by alums of Noma\u2019s Nordic Food Lab. Like all of Empirical\u2019s offerings, which include spirits flavored with habanero and katsuobushi, Can 01 defies easy categorization. At 10% ABV\u2014somewhere between a double IPA and wine\u2014it\u2019s made with a spirit drawn from beet molasses and Belgian saison yeast and flavored with tart green gooseberry and floral milk oolong. Toasted birch and pomelo zest complete the party. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d your date will ask. \u201cShhhh, let\u2019s not define ourselves,\u201d you\u2019ll whisper. \u2014MacKenzie Chung Fegan, senior commerce editorPhoto by Emma FishmanFor Quality Porch Sitting and Murder Mystery ReadingAll I want to do on summer vacation is sit on a porch and read my mysteries. Thanks to the best grocery store in Michigan, Western Market, I was introduced to De La Calle\u2019s Ginger Manzana Tepache, a fermented (and booze-free) Mexican drink I\u2019ll take over kombucha any day of the week. It\u2019s super fragrant with black pepper and cinnamon, but the taste is all spicy ginger and sweet pineapple. I love soda, but this is the low-sugar alternative I needed for the sake of my glucose levels. (BTW: This summer\u2019s thriller is The Girl in the Mirror.) \u2014Alexandra Beggs, senior staff writerPhoto by Emma FishmanFor the Beach That\u2019s Getting a Li\u2019l ChillyYou\u2019re at the beach, the sand is kind of gray and wet, and the breeze has a bit of an autumnal bite to it. But you\u2019re going to have a Beach Day, damn it, and Fishers Island Lemonade is going to help you. The premixed cocktail of vodka, whiskey, lemon, and honey is like distilled summer in a can. It tastes bright and sweet and a little sour\u2014and, at 9% ABV for the original version, festive. For less of a kick, the bubbly Fizz is my favorite at 5% ABV. As the back of the can declares, here\u2019s to summer never ending. \u2014Karen Yuan, lifestyle editorFor the Nice Picnic Where Someone Brought a Charcuterie BoardThe few canned wines and cocktails I\u2019ve tried have felt paradoxically too sweet and too bland. That\u2019s why I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Licence IV\u2019s Blanc. Made from Melon de Bourgogne grapes from the Loire Valley in France, its citrusy notes, balanced acidity, and touch of salinity paired perfectly with the fried-and-salted green tomatoes I snacked on after a run so humid that steam was coming off the roads. I\u2019d be thrilled to catch sight of its tr\u00e9s \u00e9l\u00e9gant label in the cooler at my next picnic or backyard barbecue. \u2014Jenna Adrian-Diaz, assistant to the editor in chiefPhoto by Emma FishmanFor the Great Outdoors, Post-Hike or Post-Lake DipAs an elder millennial, I just can\u2019t with the kids and their hard seltzers, spiked kombuchas, and all the other inscrutable cans in my bodega\u2019s fridge right now. Wine in a can, though: That I can get behind. At this summer\u2019s BYOB hangs, I\u2019ve been bringing Nomadica along as my plus one. Curated by L.A.-based somm Kristin Olszewski, the label\u2019s sustainably farmed, low-intervention wines are made to taste fresh and vibrant straight from the single-serving can. I go for the sparkling options\u2014a citrusy white, made from a blend of Albari\u00f1o and Chardonnay, or the crisp ros\u00e9 (100% Pinot Noir). And that\u2019s as close to White Claw as I\u2019m gonna get. \u2014Amanda Shapiro, editorial directorPhoto by Emma FishmanFor Nights In When You Just Gotta Order UberEatsWhenever I\u2019m swinging by an H-Mart or putting in my take-out sushi order, I always add a Calpico or two to my cart. Calpico soda tastes like an unnameable, tropical, vanilla-y fruit that I wish I could take a juicy bite of\u2026but for now, I\u2019ll settle for sipping on it in soda form. It\u2019s floral, fruity, and not overly saccharine. There\u2019s simply no other drink I\u2019d rather cleanse my palate with. \u2014Mehreen Karim, recipe production assistantFor the Beach That\u2019s Not IpanemaWhen I first poured one of Novo Fogo\u2019s Caipirinha cocktails into a glass, I was a little shaken. I was expecting the vibrant green color of Brazil\u2019s signature lime-and-cacha\u00e7a drink, but what I got was a crystal-clear soda that\u2019s more hard seltzer than beachy cocktail. After my first sip, though, my worries were put to bed. The original lime flavor is sweet and almost spicy\u2014like a Dark \u2019n\u2019 Stormy with less of the stormy darkness. The fruity flavors tasted fresh and real, unlike some of the candy-sweet seltzers I\u2019ve tried in the past, and nothing about its flavor betrayed its 8.2% (!) alcohol content. Sure, it\u2019s not quiiite Caipirinha, but I\u2019m not quite in Rio either, so I won\u2019t feel guilty bringing a few of these half-size cans to the oceanside. Sa\u00fade! \u2014Nico Avalle, digital production assistantFor That Brutal 3 p.m. Work SlumpA few cases of Minna\u2019s Orange Mango Black Tea showed up at the office nearly two years ago and I grabbed one in a bid to counteract a particularly vicious 3 p.m. slump. And it was...glorious. The mango actually tastes like voluptuous fresh fruit, while the orange is barely there, in a good way. The snap of black tea, with its refreshing bite of astringent tannins, leaves you refreshed yet always ready for one more sip. \u2014Chris Morocco, test kitchen directorPhoto by Emma FishmanFor Floating on a Giant Inflatable Animal in the PoolNothing says, \u201cPOOL DAY!\u201d more than a spritz, and there\u2019s no spritz (according to me) better than this one from Usual Wines. It\u2019s a blend of California brut (a fun \u2019n\u2019 fancy way to say sparkling wine) and pressed Japanese yuzu juice; the flavor is light, bright, and delightfully citrusy without any of the cloying sweetness that comes with many a mixed drink. The best part: At only 7.25% ABV, I still have my wits about me enough to crush the inflatable narwhal relay. \u2014Ali Francis, associate editorPhoto by Emma FishmanFor Day-Drinking on a Friend\u2019s Parent\u2019s PontoonPontoon drinking is an all-day affair, and that\u2019s when you want a low-ABV thirst quencher that is anything but White Claw (unless there\u2019s only WC, in which case, I\u2019ll still drink it). I\u2019m obsessed with Stillwater Sparkling\u2019s hard seltzers, especially Citrus Haze, which is bright and sunny and juicy. Its seltzers are flavored with hops and not \u201cnatural flavors,\u201d whatever that means (eye roll), so if you like craft beer, jump on these. \u2014A.B.Photo by Emma FishmanFor Impressing Coworkers at the Get-to-Know-You Happy HourFew things are better than the sound of cracking open an ice-cold can of beer sake. With a slightly fruity, full-bodied flavor (is that mango? Papaya? Yeasty, fresh-baked banana bread, even?) and a viscous mouthfeel, Kikusui\u2019s 6-ounce cuties are just the right thing when opening a whole bottle feels excessive. I\u2019ll split a can over dinner after work, but I don\u2019t always feel like sharing. (A word to the wise if you go it alone: At 19% ABV, the petite package packs a punch.) And in case you\u2019re wondering: No, the adorable cans were not designed just to pull at your heartstrings. This unpasteurized, undiluted brew is so delicate that the typical translucent glass bottles wouldn\u2019t do. \u2014Sasha Levine, digital directorPhoto by Emma FishmanFor the Backyard Grilling Sesh That\u2019s Getting a Li\u2019l Too HotThe Instagram community is a thing of beauty. Someone had paired the Smooj Pi\u00f1a Colada with my hot honey wings and tagged me in their post. It certainly piqued my curiosity, and I have to say, thanks for a great rec! The drink really is perfect for an outdoor party. Made with pineapple pur\u00e9e, key lime pur\u00e9e and cream of coconut, this hard seltzer smoothie is unlike any other. It is thick and jam-packed with heavily fruited flavors yet light and sparkly. It\u2019s the perfect boozy refresher for a hot grilling day. \u2014Jessie YuChen, assistant food editorPhoto by Emma FishmanFor Retreating Indoors When It\u2019s 90 Degrees OutI cannot help but keep reaching for a can of Kimino\u2019s Ume sparkling water. The Japanese plum juice is sourced from the Wakayama prefecture and the spring water from the Hyogo mountains. It is perfectly bubbly, with a hint of sour, and it immediately quenches me on a hot day. It\u2019s no wonder why I always have a few cans hanging around in my fridge. \u2014Rachel Gurjar, associate food editorExplore Bon App\u00e9titLifestyleShoppingRecipes you want to make.
