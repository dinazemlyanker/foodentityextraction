The dining room\u2019s clean lines and neutral hues are interrupted only by pops of green from potted palm plants and romantically draped vines of ivy. It\u2019s the kind of atmosphere that enhances the dining experience, a credit to the laidback style that its chef, Daniela Soto-Innes, wields both in and out of the kitchen. In a setting that\u2019s at once serene and sensational, Soto-Innes\u2019s sublime dishes pack a powerful punch. Whether it\u2019s day or night, her pared-down approach leads to stunning results.\u201cI like ingredients that are simple yet powerful,\u201d says Daniela. She often meets with Hugo Vera, ATLA\u2019s chef de cuisine, to workshop new dishes for the restaurant\u2019s brunch and dinner menus inspired by produce they find at New York City markets. The two like to sit at the sleek counter in the dining room, drinking S.Pellegrino\u00ae and mulling over interesting ways to use fresh ingredients they\u2019ve encountered. The results can be stunning: On a recent outing, Hugo came across an intensely aromatic chile. Back at ATLA, it sparked both chefs\u2019 imagination\u2014they blackened it to a deep char before grinding it into a fragrant spice blend called recado negro, which enrobes a sultry black ceviche, or aguachile as it\u2019s known in Mexico.Harry EelmanBut it\u2019s not just restaurant chefs like Daniela and Hugo who can elevate fresh and seasonal ingredients. With a few tips from the pros, anyone can heighten understated dishes into unforgettable and elegant experiences. Here are the secrets that make ATLA\u2019s menu shine.1. It\u2019s all about sourcing.  In delivering an experience that\u2019s authentically Mexican, it comes down to ingredients. But there\u2019s more to it than you think. At ATLA, Daniela and Hugo source from the best in the business, which\u2014for fresh items like fish, meat, and produce\u2014is often the farmers\u2019 market around the corner. But to fully transport her diners\u2019 palates south of the border, she looks beyond New York City. \u201cThe dry spices that we use [are] from Mexico,\u201d she explains. Whether you\u2019re whipping up Mexican or Moroccan at home, Daniela advises that home cooks seek out spice blends or dried ingredients from those places. Ingredients that lack moisture can last longer and travel farther, making them more accessible to home cooks.Harry Eelman2. Turn something familiar on its head. Don\u2019t feel restricted by tradition\u2014experiment with time-honored recipes in new ways. The best example? That recado negro ceviche. \u201cRecado negro is typical of the Yucatan Peninsula,\u201d explains Daniela. \u201cIt\u2019s usually a dry rub where all the ingredients are burnt and used on whole animals.\u201d But instead of taking the usual route with this recipe, the chefs took a chance and made it into a sauce draped over delicate slivers of raw scallops and fluke, topped off with fresh cucumber juice, citrus, and ginger. After they spooned it onto crunchy tostadas and took a bite, the two chefs knew they\u2019d nailed it. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to put it on the menu,\u201d she says. The bright flavors are especially enhanced when paired with S.Pellegrino\u00ae, which joins delicate bubbles and an exceptional mineral balance.3. Small tweaks can make a big difference. \u201cI like to take common ingredients that might seem simple, but elevate them in a very unique way,\u201d says Daniela. One of her favorite examples of a simple touch with huge impact is a dessert at her friend Jaime Young\u2019s restaurant, Sunday in Brooklyn. There, he finishes a simple soft-serve ice cream with a sprinkle of sea salt. \u201cIt may seem like a small thing, but those details make it really, really special,\u201d says Daniela. \u201cI like how Chef Jaime takes time to consider those details.\u201dHarry Eelman4. Take inspiration from your mama. There\u2019s a reason your mom\u2019s cooking is some of the best in the world. It\u2019s comforting! When in doubt, turn to those flavors\u2014and wait for everyone to catch the feels. Growing up, \u201cI was around food all the time,\u201d Daniela says. \u201cI'm from Mexico City, so you have food stands everywhere you go. My grandma had a bakery, and my mom dreamed of being a chef. So food is everything for me.\u201d Luckily for her, the cooking gene clearly runs in the family. \u201cI cook with the flavors that I remember growing up with,\u201d says Daniela, adding that nostalgia is a category of flavor unto itself: If something makes you smile, go with it!Harry Eelman5. Keep it flavor-forward. You know that old saying about putting together an outfit? Before leaving the house, look in the mirror and remove one accessory. The same principle plays out when elevating a high-end dish from good to mind-blowing. \u201cWe look for spice, acidity, tartness, and really deep, strong and clean flavors,\u201d said Daniela. \u201cThat\u2019s why some of our dishes, it\u2019s just the sauce, or the sauce with one veggie.\u201dThe bottom line: Creativity in the kitchen doesn\u2019t need to be complicated. Focus on the best ingredients and inspiring flavors\u2014but, most importantly, add your own personal touch to enhance each dish and make it uniquely yours.Harry EelmanWant to learn more about creating more tasteful moments?
