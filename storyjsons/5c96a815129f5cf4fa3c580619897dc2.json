Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Dear Healthyish readers,This week, Amanda Shapiro and I took over the Bon App\u00e9tit Foodcast to talk about solo-cooking, a subject I wrote about a few weeks back. Relistening to our conversation (live from our brand-new home podcast studios, a.k.a. our closets\u2014or, in my case, my roommate\u2019s closet) got me thinking about the difference between \u201cmeal prepping\u201d and \u201cmeal planning.\u201dI realized that my dislike of the term \u201cmeal prep\u201d goes beyond the fact that it conjures up the staid image of five identical containers of neatly-packed chicken breasts, sweet potatoes, and kale. I don\u2019t like the idea that once the prep is over, your meals are no longer something you have get to think about for the rest of the week. Some people find this one-and-done strategy empowering (and more power to them), but that\u2019s  just not what leaves me feeling excited to eat every day.Meal planning, on the other hand, is defined by a sense of limitless possibility. It\u2019s about prepping some things ahead of time (like your herbs and greens), maybe flagging a couple of recipes that sound really good, but ultimately letting the finer details of your meals come into focus day by day, rather than trying to predetermine your whims and cravings. It\u2019s about planning just enough that you\u2019re not concerned about wasting food, but leaving enough flexibility and room for your real life, imperfect and fickle and not always in the mood for chicken breasts.Here are a few of the (loose!) rules I follow as a planner, not a prepper.What a week of dinners looks like in the Karten household.\nDo: Write It DownI generally know what I have to use up first in the fridge, but I might start taking a literal page out of associate social media director Rachel Karten\u2019s meal-planning notebook, pictured above. She\u2019s a recent meal-planning convert who, at the beginning of each week, jots down a rough menu plan (with pen and paper) based on what\u2019s in her pantry and what she bought on her weekly grocery trip, which usually includes lots of fresh vegetables and herbs. I really love the key sub-sections she uses to specify what she needs to defrost ahead of time (meats and fish), what she needs to freeze (leftover sandwich bread) and what she can make ahead to cut down on prep time (sauces and yeasted doughs).Freeze extra pierogies now, eat them whenever.\nDo: Shop At HomeGood meal planning is all about knowing what you have, or \u201cshopping at home.\u201d Last week, I finally tackled a project I\u2019d been putting off for maybe close to a year (but now that it\u2019s done I feel extreme relief): documenting every single item in my pantry, spice cabinet, freezer, and fridge in a multi-tabbed Google spreadsheet. It\u2019s not...a short list. I\u2019m especially mortified by how much shit I\u2019ve amassed in the freezer since my freezer edit from a few weeks back (huge bag of oxtails, how did you get in here?!) But now that I know exactly what\u2019s in there, I\u2019ve resolved to cook at least one thing from the freezer every day, and have a long list of delicious ideas (in the spreadsheet, of course) for dishes I can\u2019t wait to make. On the docket this weekend: make broth with those oxtail bones; bike baggies of extra homemade braised short rib pierogies and pork dumplings to nearby friends who could use a quick meal; and turn my family-size stockpile of Vista Hermosa corn tortillas into vegetarian enchiladas for our Sunday house dinner.Don\u2019t: Get Hung Up If Your Plans ChangeMaking a loose meal plan for the week can be great and freeing; making one that doesn\u2019t build in some flexibility for swaps or the occasional uncharted detour is unrealistic. Things will veer off course: the scallions will go slimy before you get to them. You\u2019ll realize you\u2019re out of sour cream. You\u2019ll wake up in the morning and find you somehow have zero desire for the tacos you\u2019d planned on having for dinner. Don\u2019t sweat it. Reconfigure and make a new plan\u2014 just make sure it leads you to something you\u2019re excited to eat. Even the best-laid meal plans go awry, but I\u2019ve become a more resilient, resourceful, and straight-up better cook by embracing the unexpected chaos.Happy planning,Christina ChaeyAssociate editorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishWhat's Chaey Cooking?Meal PrepessayRead MoreCoronavirusHow I Threw a Dinner Party in IsolationBy Christina ChaeyRecipes you want to make.
