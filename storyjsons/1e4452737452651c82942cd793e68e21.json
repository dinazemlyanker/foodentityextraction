Don't let the order-at-the-counter vibes fool you at RT Rotisserie: This is really good food, from the folks behind non-fast casual restaurant Rich Table.ORDER THE: rotisserie chicken, obviously. But please also get the RTR Salad, a bracing mix of greens, herbs, pickled onions, cotija, and seeds. We recommend it with rotisserie duck, a steal for only $3 more. For sides, we're partial to the dirty rice but understand if you want a vegetable\u2014there's charred cabbage, Brussels sprouts Caesar, and seared broccoli.THE VIBE IS: tech dude grabbing food to-go meets a family getting a quick dinner meets two female friends catching up over chicken and a glass of ros\u00e9 (oh yeah, there's also beer and wine).PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day, from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. RT Rotisserie also does delivery and catering.\u2014Carey PolisKassie BorresonKassie BorresonWE ALSO LOVETartine ManufactoryThe megabakery-slash-wine-bar-slash-ice-cream-shop-slash-restaurantAL's PlaceObsession goes casual at this hard-to-get-into Mission hot spotArsicault BakeryCroissants and pastries worth waiting for Explore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
