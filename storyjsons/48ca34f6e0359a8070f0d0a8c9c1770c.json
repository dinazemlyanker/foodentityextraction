This is to say that if you\u2019re making these traditional Turkish dumplings for a Turkish person, they need to be small\u2014ideally hazelnut-size\u2014or you\u2019ll lose their respect at first glance. When I set out to make them for my Turkish person, my boyfriend Can, I had the naive self-confidence of a food professional who tests recipes for work and makes sourdough bread on a regular basis, so I thought I had a fairly good chance of success.It had been well over a year since Can had been able to visit his family in Adana, and I dreamed that making him his favorite childhood dish would alleviate his homesickness. I was familiar with the mant\u0131-making basics: The dough must be rolled as thinly as possible and cut into perfect squares. A spoonful of onion and spiced meat is laid on each square, and each individual piece is folded into impossibly small pyramids. I knew that mant\u0131 is notoriously tedious to make and fittingly reserved for holidays, where the entire family gathers around the table to help. In other words, Turkish grandmas are essential, but I was determined.With no Turkish grandma of my own, I watched YouTube videos, read blogs, consulted my Turkish culinary encyclopedia (Musa Da\u011fdeviren\u2019s The Turkish Cookbook), and ignored Can as he told me more than once that my \u201cfun date night activity\u201d was a terrible idea. He was right. Our dumplings were too large yet understuffed, mostly lopsided, and took what can only be described as forever. As we sat down to eat a well-intentioned but mediocre meal at 9 p.m., I bowed my head in defeat.Unwilling to throw in the towel, I turned to the internet for help. I found everything from grandmothers selling their culinary wares on Etsy to dried packaged mant\u0131 on Amazon to entire marketplaces dedicated to bringing Turkish foods to homesick expats in the U.S. I tried many, and while most were better than mine, there were two that hit the right combination of nostalgic (for my boyfriend) and easy (for me): beef-filled frozen mant\u0131 from Moda and dried vegetarian mant\u0131 from Irem, no rolling and cutting and stuffing and folding required.Photo by Emma FishmanShop Mant\u0131:$14 at Amazon (Irem brand)$10 at Select Foods (Moda brand)I\u2019ve since stocked up, and premade mant\u0131 has quickly replaced frozen pizza as our go-to meal when we don\u2019t feel like cooking\u2014and a far superior one at that. I simply throw a package into boiling salted water, slather the cooked dumplings with salty, garlicky yogurt and frothy Aleppo pepper-seasoned melted butter, and finish it all with a sprinkling of dried mint and sumac. (Alternatively, check out Refika'n\u0131n Mutfa\u011f\u0131\u2014\u201cRefikas Kitchen\u201d\u2014for a slightly fancier version. I could spend all day watching her instructional how-to videos on cooking Turkish cuisine.)Though Can won't admit it, I know the Turkish food I cook for him is never quite right. I can rarely find the ingredients of his childhood home, a lush plain about an hour inland from the Mediterranean sea, and I\u2019m just not his mother or grandmother. As delicious as any recipe might turn out\u2014and as happy as it makes us both\u2014there\u2019s still that nagging feeling that it\u2019s not the same. But, when we first tried Moda\u2019s frozen mant\u0131, he had the joyous, eyes-closed moment I had spent so many hours trying to achieve\u2014except this time, it took me all of 20 minutes. What started as an attempt at a special occasion dinner turned into something much better: a simple, weeknight meal that brings a small piece of home to the person I love.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make.
