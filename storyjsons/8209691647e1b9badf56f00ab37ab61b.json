She held them out to me in her palm and cried, \u201cThis? This is a serving size of Fritos!\u201d It was approximately seven corn chips, and it was the saddest thing we\u2019d ever seen. And then we ate the whole bag, piled on bowls of creamy, chipotle black bean soup that she\u2019d just made in an Instant Pot.It\u2019s the reason we\u2019re gathered here today, to celebrate this new recipe that utilizes one of a pressure cooker\u2019s best features: turning dried beans into soft ones in 20 minutes (as opposed to two to three hours it takes on the stove).There\u2019s always that moment with Instant Pot recipes when your whole body just wants to dump everything in the pot, close it, and call it a day. But if you want a soup with real flavor, ya gotta build it. Carla\u2019s Instant Pot black bean soup recipe begins with cooking bacon on the pot\u2019s saut\u00e9 function, then sweating some onions, carrot, and garlic, before adding some chipotle chiles in adobo, spices, a pound of dried beans, and water. The chiles, cumin, and salt make this an incredibly well-seasoned and spicy soup, and we loved it, but you can use just one chile, and less salt, if you\u2019d prefer something milder.A note on timing: I\u2019d estimate there\u2019s 15 minutes of cook time before you close the pot, around 20 minutes to build pressure depending on the machine, 20 minutes cook time under pressure, and 10 minutes to naturally release pressure. Still, it\u2019s a lot of soup, for a very low cost, in an hour! Isn\u2019t pressure cooking fun?!When the beans are done, use an immersion blender right in the pot (or use a regular blender) to pur\u00e9e the soup into a smooth consistency. Then top each bowl with sour cream, onions, lime juice, cilantro, and Fritos, obviously.Get the recipe:Instant Pot Black Bean SoupThis black bean soup is seasoned with a heavy hand. If you are salt- or spice-averse, decrease the amount of salt to 1\u00bd tsp. and use 1 chipotle chile with 1 tsp. adobo sauce instead.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titInstant PotBlack BeansSoupRecipes you want to make.
