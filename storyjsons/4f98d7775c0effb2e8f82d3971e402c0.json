All of these juices will overflow a standard pie dish and you\u2019ll end up with burnt fruit caramel on your oven floor. For this crumble recipe, make sure to use a deep pie dish, or an 8x8x2\" baking dish will work well too. This recipe is part of the Healthyish Farmers\u2019 Market Challenge.

It's not too sweet and the nuts made for a nice crunchy addition to the topping. I made mine with some less-than-perfect black plums, raspberries, and almonds instead of pistachios since that's what I had in the house. It's a little juicy but it's perfect over vanilla ice cream. ViaBrusChicago10/9/2019So yummy, topping was great and fruit still had a little bite.AnonymousDayton, OH 9/26/2019Just made this recipe with nectarines instead of plums, cinnamon instead of cardamom, and vegan butter. And I used my fingers instead of a food processor. It was delicious! Though next time I may make more topping because it\u2019s so good. The filling would also be great baked off by itself. Not mushy at all.AnonymousMichigan9/2/2019I made it with only 1.5 lbs of prune plums. If I had 3lbs, I would double the topping and use a larger pan.\nAlso I would omit the cornstarch altogether. I am not sure it was necessary.AnonymousCanada10/19/2018Loved how easy and simple this crumble was to make. The cardamom adds such a delicious, unique profile to the plums!Anonymous9/28/2018This was delicious and so simple! I don't have a food processor so I just rubbed in the butter by hand and it turned out great. Mine baked in 40 minutes, and it wasn't too soggy at all.AnonymousNew York 9/10/2018This recipe is great, and super simple! I didn't have a deep dish pie pan, so I made 1/2 the filling and topped it with the normal amount of topping. I made everything as is, only substituting dairy-free butter for the butter in the crust. Came out great!AnonymousBoston9/2/2018I made this and it was really nice. I had a mix of very ripe and slightly less-ripe plums. They are a European variety, so small and dark, almost deep blue or black. I cut each plum into quarters, and this way it wasn\u2019t too juicy. I tossed a small handful (1/4 cup?) of oats in with the crumble. Baked between 35 and 40 minutes. It is delicious!AnonymousGermany 8/7/2018We liked this recipe. Used ripe but not mushy red plums, cut a generous 1/3 inch. Added oats and cinnamon to the crumble. Baked it in a square dish. Baked for 35 minutes then broiled the crumbled for 2-3 minutes.  Not mushy at all.  AnonymousVancouver, BC8/4/2018This recipe was awesome! made it for a party and it went in seconds. My only problem was I may have picked some plums that were borderline not ripe enough so it turned out a little too tart. This is great for friends with / without teeth! Might try swapping out plums with apples the next time!AnonymousWinnipeg7/29/2018So......even after reading the review below:) I thought I would try it. Well, the review below was not that far off. I don't know if it was the type of plums.....I used Black California Plums. The skin peeled off most of the plums as I was slicing them. There was a bunch of juice in the pan before it went into the oven. I added some oatmeal to the crumble just for fun. My family liked it but it was quite runny. Put some ice cream on top.AnonymousMidwest7/28/201845 minutes of cooking makes a plum mud, yuck.  This was like eating a bowl of jelly, tasty but pasty mush.  Think applesauce sandwich, bleck.  Best for a toothless friend.HighfatherColumbus Oh7/23/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titCrumbleFruit DessertDessertAmericanPlumStone FruitFruitCardamomHerbs & SpicesPistachioNutLemonCitrusSummerHealthyishBakingBreakfastRecipes you want to make.
