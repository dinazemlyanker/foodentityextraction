Neither is Harry Potter, the Tooth Fairy, or flattering white pants. But we do have some magic left in this world: cornstarch. Seriously, what can\u2019t cornstarch do? Not only is it the ingredient responsible for crispiness in so many instances\u2014from baked chicken wings to deep-fried chicken thighs to saut\u00e9ed shrimp to pan-fried cubed tofu\u2014but it also makes cakes and cookies tender and soft. Talk about working both sides of the aisle.But that\u2019s not all. In stir-fries, cornstarch helps thinly sliced protein like beef or pork brown evenly without overcooking, while simultaneously turning the liquidy soy, rice wine vinegar, and mirin into a veg-coating sauce. Cornstarch creates gravy that pools in, rather than drips down, mashed potatoes; it binds together runny fruit fillings into juicy-but-sliceable pie slices; it gives otherwise thin soups body (like a hair volumizer for your broth!); and it is the magical thickener in Sohla El-Waylly\u2019s spicy, creamy queso.But with all of this power comes great responsibility. To harness the incredible thickening magic of cornstarch for soups, dips, and custards/puddings/ice creams (that is, wherever there\u2019s a large amount of liquid involved, more so than in a stir-fry or pie filling), you can\u2019t just throw it in the pot and hope for the best. No, you have to treat it right\u2014specifically, in these two ways.First, you\u2019ve got to make a slurry.It sounds like an unfortunate weather forecast (slush plus flurries?), but a slurry actually refers to a mixture of cornstarch whisked with a small amount of cold or room temperature liquid. In the queso example, the slurry consists of cornstarch plus \u00bc cup milk. Making a slurry adds another step to the recipe, sure, but it also reduces the risk that the cornstarch will clump up into starchy, grainy pockets when added to the rest of the liquid. It\u2019s worth it.Second, you must fully activate the power of the cornstarch by bringing the mixture to a boil.While whisking or stirring constantly (again, lump prevention), pour your slurry into the pot of warm liquid. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture has come to a boil and thickened, usually 1 to 2 minutes. Cornstarch needs heat (in the ballpark of 203\u00b0F) in order for \u201cstarch gelatinization\u201d\u2014that is, the scientific process in which starch granules swell and absorb water\u2014to occur. In other words, if you don\u2019t heat your cornstarch to a high enough temperature, your mixture will never thicken. But once your liquid has boiled, lower the heat and don\u2019t return it to a simmer\u2014you\u2019ll risk destroying the starch molecules and ending up with a thin mixture yet again. (In that unfortunate event, make another cornstarch slurry and try again.)If all of this seems a little fussy, just think: Cornstarch does so much for us, why not commit to doing these two acts in return? Your queso deserves it.Get the recipe:Queso, Not From a JarYou could be totally hammered halfway through the Super Bowl and still make this queso.
