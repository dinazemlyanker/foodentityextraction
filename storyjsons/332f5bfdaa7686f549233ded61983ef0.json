Do This First.\u00a0Before you stock up on a bunch of reusable products, figure out what waste you're replacing.\u00a0By Aliza AbarbanelOctober 24, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailIn It\u2019s Getting Hot in Here, Healthyish assistant editor (and aspiring low-waste disciple) Aliza Abarbanel walks us through one thing we can do each month to adapt our lifestyles and pantries for a pre-apocalyptic world. Up first: Taking a trip through our trash cans to gain a new perspective on what low-waste looks like.The ProblemI don\u2019t have to tell you why we\u2019re here. With all the bleak environmental studies, ominous breaking news updates, and Greta Thunburg memes, we\u2019ve got climate change on the brain...pretty much all the time. Sweeping reform lies in the hands of corporations and countries, but cutting down on trash is one way to enact change as individuals. So here we are carrying carrying our reusable totes and wondering what to do next. There\u2019s a seemingly endless parade of so-called eco-friendly products on the market, from shampoo bars to silicon bags, but before we start spending on all those chic, well-branded alternatives, we have to think about what waste problems we actually need to solve. There\u2019s no point in hoarding stainless steel straws if you never used the plastic ones in the first place.So how do you figure out which habits are worth changing\u2014and what products are worth buying? For the first installment of It's Getting Hot in Here, I'm challenging you to take a trip through your trash can (I promise, it\u2019s not as gross as it sounds). Once you know what you\u2019re throwing out, you\u2019ll know where to spend your money on sustainable replacements.The ChallengeTrack everything you\u2019re tossing and recycling for one week. (Yep, we\u2019re also aiming to reduce our recycling, which I will explain more below.) If you\u2019re already composting, that\u2019s great! No need to include those onion peels, but if your food scraps end up in the trash can, add them to the list.Know right now that you\u2019re probably not going to eliminate all trash from your life, and that\u2019s okay. This challenge is like setting up a budget for waste instead of money\u2014you\u2019re still going to spend (a.k.a. throw out) something, but you can choose when to take the hit.Step 1: Make a list.Sure, you could grab some gloves and actually dig through your bin at the end of the week, but avoid the mess (and probably the single-use plastic gloves) by writing things down as you go. Put this list somewhere you won\u2019t forget about it, like on the fridge or right above the trash can, so tracking can become a seamless part of your routine. Use a note on your phone to tally up anything you toss while away from home, then update your tracker before bed to leave no disposable coffee cup behind.Step 2: Sort your waste.Divide up your list into three categories: Trash, recycling, and would-be compost (if you don\u2019t use a compost bin).Obviously, straight-up trash is the biggest problem to focus on here, but plenty of stuff we usually toss in the bin can actually be composted or recycled. Compostable material varies depending on the capacity of your compost site, but organic materials like coffee grounds, produce scraps, and non-greasy foods are almost always fair game. If your compost gets picked up curbside and processed at major plants, things like bones and cooked leftovers are okay to include too. If these rules seem complicated, don\u2019t fear: We\u2019ll get into this more in a future column.Recycling may feel like the responsible move, but it\u2019s important to track that too because most of it ends up in the trash due to contaminated shipments and recycling plant restrictions. A particularly bleak 2017 study found that only 9% of plastic actually gets recycled. Also, a lot of our recycling is aspirational: Plastic shopping bags and lined to-go cups aren\u2019t just unrecyclable\u2014they contaminate shipments and risk the whole bundle getting rejected. So while it\u2019s possible your stuff will get recycled, reducing and reusing should come first.Step 3: Make a game plan.Circle any items appearing on your list more than once, then tally up the repeat offenders to figure out which changes will have the biggest impact. Start by seeing if you can repurpose what you already own, like reaching for absorbent kitchen towels instead of paper towels. Then think about which reusable products you\u2019ll actually use the most, like opting for a travel thermos to take to your usual coffee shop or ditching plastic wrap for bee\u2019s wrap. Finally, examine store bought items you might want to make at home to cut down on packaging, like nut butter granola bars or cashew yogurt.Why It WorksCutting down on your trash means there\u2019s less waste going into landfills, which are the third-largest source of human-related methane emissions in the U.S. after natural gas and petroleum systems and agriculture. (Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, traps heat in our atmosphere at 34 times the rate of CO2.)But the real point of this challenge is to learn about our habits, because we have to understand our waste problem in order to fix it. In future columns, we\u2019ll explore topics like turning food scraps into delicious dishes, cleaning without a million paper towels or clunky plastic spray bottles, and composting for people who think they can\u2019t compost (yes, even you with the cramped apartment and no outdoor space). Come for the occasional existential crisis about the environmental impact of quesadillas, stay for actionable advice that\u2019s sustainable for your life and the planet. We\u2019re gonna get through this together, and nobody\u2019s going to have to give up cheese forever.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishIt's Getting Hot in HereessayRead MoreLifestyleCould Zero-Waste Stores Be the Future of Retail?By Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
