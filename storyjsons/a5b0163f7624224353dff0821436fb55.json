It is so much more interesting than your standard banana bread!  A couple notes, you will need about 1.75-2 oz each of sesame and poppy seeds (I accidentally bought twice as much, so I will probably be making this again in the near future).  Also, I thought it wasn't quite sweet enough and drizzled honey on top, but my parents both thought it was plenty sweet and ate it just as is.  Bakes beautifully, mine looked almost exactly like the picture. AnonymousPittsburgh, PA6/29/2021Agree w/ MHARPER4 in that this is also the best banana bread I've possibly had E V E R. It's a huge hit w/ friends and family I've shared this with. I've definitely come back to this recipe a few times and love it still. godsyllaLos Angeles, CA4/6/2021I followed the recipe to a T and my loaf came out of the oven hearty and colored a gorgeous dark brown. The bread is dense, which makes just one or two slices enough for breakfast. The bread is dry for banana bread, but still plenty moist. It would go great in a bowl with some milk if you prefer a more moist slice. The seeds inside and the crust on top add a crunch to make the bread feel less cake-y and the lessened sweetness is perfect for making the banana more than just an ingredient for sugar. You can really appreciate the subtle banana flavor in this bread alongside the toasted nuts and seeds. While I love the lowered sugar, my mom put jam on hers to boost the sweetness of the bread. All around great, simple recipe that provides a quick breakfast for days ahead.adeline2000Harrisonburg, VA6/18/2020This is the best banana bread I\u2019ve made possibly ever. I\u2019m preg so I\u2019ve been looking for nutritious baked goods to eat quickly in the morning and this is a winner. I used coconut oil because I love it in quick-breads and chia seeds instead of poppy because that\u2019s what I had. I don\u2019t normally like nuts in banana bread but toasted pecans really make this great. WILL make again!Mharper4Raleigh, NC1/11/2020Loved this, the perfect match with coffee for a not-too-sweet breakfast. It's also very customizable: I did a mixture of chia, flax, and sesame seeds and used chopped roasted cashews since I didn't have any pecans. The result was just as delicious.AnonymousBerlin, Germany11/1/2019What can I use instead of 2 eggs here? Are the eggs being used to rise the bread or texture?AnonymousIndia2/28/2019Great texture between the poppy seed crunch and the meatiness of the pecans.  Not too sweet and still a great breakfast/snack treat.Chicago1/30/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titBreadPoppy SeedSeedBananaFruitPecanNutWalnutEasySheet-Pan DinnersSnackDairy-FreeVegetarianHealthyishBakingBreakfastRecipes you want to make.
