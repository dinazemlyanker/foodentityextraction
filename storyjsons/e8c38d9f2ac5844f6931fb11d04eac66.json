Our team didn't win but I didn\u2019t mind\u2014all I remember from that trip was the keema our coach took us out to eat for multiple meals.Keema means \u201cminced\u201d in Hindi, and while it usually refers to meat, there are vegetarian keema dishes available made with soy, paneer, and tofu all around the country. The mince is stewed or fried in aromatic spices, and is traditionally served solo or used to stuff samosas and naan.The keema from my basketball days was made with goat meat, which is one of the most common types of keema found around India. Served in a wide steel plate with the perfect ratio of minced meat and sauciness. My young mind didn't quite understand why it tasted so good, but I know now that it was flavored exquisitely, with each layer of spice playing a vital role. The warmth of cloves that makes you sweat ever so slightly, the subtle garam masala adding deep heady notes, the mint, cilantro, and lime adding a zing of freshness. This particular version was served with pav\u2014a savory soft bun to soak it all up. I licked my plate clean, literally.In my lamb keema tacos, I use ground lamb for its robust and grassy profile, combined with cumin, coriander, cloves, ginger and good quality garam masala to make this a weeknight friendly meal that is full of flavor.The key to success here is cooking down the initial aromatics until they are fully browned and the masala starts to break, meaning that the fat starts to separate from the solids, which signals that the spices have toasted and the flavors have fully developed. You could serve it with rice, flatbread, or even toast, but tortillas are a fun vehicle for this saucy mixture.The leftovers are just as good if not better, and are really versatile. You can use any extra keema to top grain bowls, pizzas, or even sandwiches. A dollop of yogurt and chopped sweet onions will take the edge off if it\u2019s your first time trying such a spice-forward dish, and don\u2019t forget a squeeze of lime to cut through the fattiness of the meat and add just enough tang to each bite.While I can't replicate that exact plate from Mumbai, I wanted to make something that was pretty close and would satisfy my nostalgia before I have the chance to visit. There are many variations of this dish, some with peas, some with potatoes, and all kinds of meat and with good reason. It\u2019s an iconic dish that is eaten and deeply loved by many.Lamb Keema TacosWith its keema-inspired ground-lamb filling and plenty of fixings, this recipe takes taco night in an exciting new direction.View RecipeRecipes you want to make.
