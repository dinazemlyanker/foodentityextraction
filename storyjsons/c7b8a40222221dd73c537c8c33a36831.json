It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Who you callin\u2019 a fazool?The fall equinox happened this weekend, which can only mean one thing: Hibernation is coming.Where once it was light and bright, it is now dark and moody. Instead of picnics and barbecues, head inside: It\u2019s Sunday soup or bust. If you ask me, the one soup that rules them all is the one with both pasta and  beans in it. That\u2019s right: pasta e fagioli. Depending where you\u2019re from, you might pronounce this \u201cpasta fazool,\u201d but I wouldn\u2019t go throwing that around unless you know what\u2019s up.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Like any good Sunday soup, pasta e fagioli is a low-and-slow, hands-off affair that you start in the morning, check on a couple of times during the day, and buy a fresh loaf of bread for in the late afternoon\u2014you know, for dunking. To make this tomato-y, Parmesan-enriched, lazily-simmered soup, you need nothing but the basics: Dried white beans, carrots, celery, garlic, herbs, and trusty tap water burble along in a big pot for a couple of hours until the beans are done. Separately, olive oil, onions, more garlic, a can of tomatoes, and a long pour from an already-opened bottle of wine team up to become a flavorful, concentrated and saucy base. Then the cooked, creamy white beans and the tomato situation invite some dried pasta and escarole over for a getting-to-know-you session that leads straight to a shallow bowl, a big spoon, and your face. Economical, filling, nutritious, and soul-affirming.There are variations, of course. You could always render some diced pancetta or bacon along with the oil and garlic that go into the tomato mixture, or you could throw a ham hock in along with the beans. Instead of the classic cannellini, use a baby lima, a cranberry bean, or a gigante. Torn collard greens, kale, green cabbage, beet greens, or blanched broccoli rabe can stand in for the escarole. Red wine could replace the white; ditalini or small shells are perfectly acceptable substitutions for the broken pieces of lasagna in the original version.Life is better with fried bread.\nOnce I come to grips with the Season of Darkness and Despair, I actually start to look forward to simmering things again. I take a nap and make a big pot of soup and I think: Right, this kind of cooking is enjoyable, too. It\u2019s not stone fruit or spring peas or anything, but it\u2019s got its own power. My children emerge from their caves, lured into the kitchen by the powerful dinner vapors, and one of them will talk me into heating up a cast-iron skillet to make fried bread on the side (though a baguette passed around the table will do just fine). You\u2019ll sleep well on a bowl of pasta fazool, and considering how short the days are getting, that\u2019s precisely the point.Get the recipe:Pasta e Fagioli with EscaroleExplore Bon App\u00e9titSoupCarla NewsletterRecipes you want to make.
