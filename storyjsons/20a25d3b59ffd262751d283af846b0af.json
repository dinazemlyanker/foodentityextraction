So humble. So everyday. Who\u2019s going to make room for that when faced with creamy mashed potatoes, tender turkey, and a boatful of gravy? Well, when you dose them in not just one, but TWO, killer sauces, they\u2019re bound to be a surprise holiday favorite. Here\u2019s why.The GlazeThe glaze that gets poured over the meltingly tender leeks is made up of just three simple ingredients: a fresno chile (or red pepper flakes if you left the store chileless), some honey, and a good amount of sherry or red wine vinegar. All of these come to a boil and then reduce halfway for about five minutes. The end result is a slightly spicy-sweet and ultra vinegary glaze that will cut through the fatty, starchy, umami-ness of everything else on your overstuffed Thanksgiving plate.The Salsa VerdeAfter the glaze bath, they get a drizzle of pine nut salsa verde of finely chopped parsley for brightness, pine nuts for toasty crunch, capers for a briny punch, and of course, olive oil and a pinch of salt. The nutty, salty, herby bite of this mixture breathes life back into those silky leeks, while complementing the sweet, spicy, acidity of the glaze.So there you have it: Sauces are the key to flavor-packed dishes. So this Thanksgiving I\u2019m thankful for the BA Test Kitchen for teaching me balance, and the power of a good sauce\u2014or two.Get the recipe:Glazed Leeks With Pine Nut Salsa VerdeWhen cooked until tender, doused in a chile-honey-vinegar sauce, and finished with a nutty, herby salsa verde, humble leeks transform into the in-demand side that no one saw coming.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titThanksgivingFallSalsa VerdeRecipes you want to make.
