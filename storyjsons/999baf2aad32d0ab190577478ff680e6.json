Food styling by Susie Theodorou.FacebookTwitterEmailWelcome back to Picky Eaters\u2019 Club, where Smitten Kitchen\u2019s Deb Perelman reveals what she actually cooks for her two kids.Of all the things I expected to happen in the realm of food once I had kids\u2014a sharp uptick in Cheerios, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, chicken tenders, and macaroni and cheese\u2014broccoli was nowhere on that list. I ate it growing up (defrosted, steamed) but not with any enthusiasm. When I began cooking on my own, I was far too interested in leafy greens, broccoli rabe, and cauliflower for ho-hum broccoli trees to ever take center stage in my kitchen.This changed when I got pregnant with my first child and my craving for iron-rich green vegetables\u2014and especially broccoli\u2014was constant. An attempt to recreate a cousin\u2019s broccoli slaw\u2014thinly sliced raw florets tossed with almonds, dried cranberries, and a shallot buttermilk ranch\u2014led to my eating the entire giant bowl standing in the kitchen that day. This recurred many, many times over the course of my pregnancy. I joked that my son would be at least 25 percent broccoli by the time he was born, and sure enough, it was the vegetable he took to the most as a toddler. His younger sister is (thankfully) no different, and so I\u2019ve gone from being a person who probably bought broccoli a single time in the decade before I had kids to buying it twice a week. I could get a Ph.D. in broccoli.I also make a whole lot more meatballs than I ever expected to as a parent\u2014and not just the kind that swim in marinara sauce on top of spaghetti. Ground meat plus lots of seasonings has proven to be a useful formula in my weeknight cooking, and meatballs also happen to make great leftovers. So it was only a matter of time before I thought to combine our family\u2019s favorite vegetable and protein in a single sheet pan dinner.Illustrations by Hisashi OkawaInspired by tsukune, the Japanese grilled chicken meatballs, I recently made a batch filled with scallions, ginger, garlic, a bit of panko, and toasted sesame oil and roasted them on a single sheet pan with broccoli florets and stems. I made a bright ginger-scallion relish for drizzling over and served it all with a side of brown rice for what I was sure would be a dinner home run. Instead, both children loudly expressed their displeasure and demanded ketchup to make it palatable.Ketchup?! I\u2019m not someone who finds America\u2019s favorite distantly vegetal condiment appalling. I rather like it on fries and burgers, and I don\u2019t expect my kids to eat chicken tenders with Sriracha (yet). But broccoli and meatballs and rice with...ketchup? Under my roof? Do I have to?It turns out they were onto something. I remembered that tsukune are often served with tare, a thick and glossy soy-based sauce with teriyaki vibes. So the next time I made the meatballs and broccoli, I served them with a sweet-sour sauce I whisked together from ingredients I had lying around, such as Worcestershire sauce, soy, honey, and...(drumroll)...ketchup! This did the trick with the kids, but I was surprised to find myself won over too\u2014the meatballs are totally better this way. It turns out this was an instance in which my kids\u2019 sometimes ridiculous tastes were, for once, a stroke of deep culinary genius\u2014but don\u2019t tell them that.Get the recipe:Sheet-Pan Chicken Meatballs and Charred BroccoliThis weeknight dinner takes its cue from Japanese grilled chicken meatballs (tsukune), and the glossy, sweet-and-sour sauce that comes with it.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titChickenBroccoliCooking For KidsWeeknightPicky Eaters\u2019 ClubRead MorecookingThis Garlic Bread Is the Secret to Converting Bean HatersBy Deb PerelmancookingA Cheesy, Bready Dinner to Please the Pickiest Eaters in Your HouseholdBy Deb PerelmanRecipes you want to make.
