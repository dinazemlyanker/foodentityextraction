But did you know that the restaurant and bar scene is just as good? Our editor in chief Dawn Davis learned this from India Maxwell, a server and bartender at Blackbird, a beloved wood-fired pizza joint in the city. Here, Maxwell shares what makes this mountain town so special, from the local breweries making her favorite beer to the best food trucks.Check out more food-focused itineraries from our favorite food people here.Chico Rice bowl with grilled morels and green sunflower tahini from Little Star DinerPhoto by Lara AgnewThe pastry case at Wild Crumb\u00a0Photo courtesy wild crumbBozeman, MontanaI moved to Bozeman about five years ago from Jackson, Wyoming, and just never left. I really adore living in Bozeman, a place where you ride your bike on the trails and through the town alleys to the restaurants. It\u2019s sort of like an extension of where I grew up.For breakfast, I go to Little Star Diner, a delightful spot owned by this adorable couple, Charlie Graham and Lauren Reich. They source as much as they possibly can from their own greenhouse and field, and their griddled corn muffin with maple syrup and grilled pears can\u2019t be missed!If I don\u2019t go there, I will often pick up some breakfast pastries at Wild Crumb\u2014I pine for the ham and Gruy\u00e8re croissant all the time.My go-to for lunch is Fink\u2019s Delicatessen, which has the most delicious sandwiches in town, such as grilled balsamic-marinated portobello and peperonata sandwiches, or Rendezvous, a food truck slinging meat- and veggie-filled crepes.Hiking the M Trail is essential for anyone visiting Bozeman. It\u2019s an easy, winding trail to the big letter \u201cM\u201d built into the side of the mountain that\u2019s facing town, and it has the best view of the entire Gallatin Valley and the surrounding peaks and mountain ranges.A top dinner spot for me\u2014other than Blackbird\u2014is Ramire\u2019s. This food truck serves these awesome (and affordable) burritos made with homemade flour tortillas. It\u2019s no-frills, straightforward, delicious Mexican food. The pork adobada burrito with guacamole and pico de gallo is my favorite.For after-dinner drinks, I\u2019ll go to Open Range. They have a great cocktail bar, and the bartenders can make whatever drink you\u2019re in the mood for. I love the Paragon, a tequila-based drink with tarragon, honey, and chile.WHERE TO STAY:The Lark, a cute retro hotel right in the middle of thingsWHAT TO BRING BACK:\u00a0Local Montana beers, like Bozeman Brewing Company\u2019s citrusy Gallatin Pale AleExplore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsTravelMontanaRecipes you want to make.
