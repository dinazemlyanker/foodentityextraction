Tossing them in a light soy dressing with crushed peanuts and shredded coconut adds a subtle but addictive crunch.

My family really enjoyed this dish.WesleyBethesda, MD4/7/2021Looks very inspiring. I am trying it for lunch.AudeRadnor , PA12/1/2020I made this as is except I added 1/2 tsp sriracha for the fresno chili- I haven't seen this chili at my local markets- and I topped it with 3 tbsp toasted macadamia nuts instead of peanuts and shredded coconut. I saut\u00e9d the asparagus in my cast iron with 1/4 tsp veggie bouillon. I really enjoyed the mix of ingredients in the sauce. The lime juice gave this a pleasant acidic punch and the honey rounded it out with a bit of sweetness. My husband said, \"let's do this again.\"J.
