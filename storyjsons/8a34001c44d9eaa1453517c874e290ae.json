We asked 80 of the most interesting people we know to reveal the local spots they love the most.When I was 24, I left the bedbug-infested apartment I was sharing with six roommates in Brooklyn and moved to Durham, North Carolina. Another thing I left in Brooklyn? A relationship. \u201cWhy break up when you can leave the state?\u201d was my mantra those days. Hey, it worked!My rent in Durham\u2014for a large portion of a three-bedroom house with a wide front porch on a tree-lined street\u2014dropped in half. For the first time as an adult, and despite being grossly underemployed, I had a little money, so I used that money to eat out and to date people, usually at the same time. My life, as one can only say about their twenties once they\u2019ve survived them, was both a disaster and amazing.It helped that Durham\u2019s food scene circa 2012 was also in a golden age: reliable and affordable, thriving but not out of control. A handful of local restaurants played key supporting roles in my various romance-sagas. I\u2019d like to endorse them here.1. Cook OutVibe: 1950s trans-fat-casualOrder: Watermelon milkshake, two strawsGreat for: Innocent, retro first dates; convincing yourself that dating will be easier down here.2. Happy ChinaVibe: Luxe suburbia\u2014dark wood, tall pleather booths, instrumental covers of \u201990s hitsOrder: General Tso\u2019s tofu, dry saut\u00e9ed string beans, extra fortune cookiesGreat for: Letting your two best friends know that you\u2019ve met your soulmate and what he\u2019s like in bed.3. Bull City Burger and BreweryVibe: Tech bros in Rainbows with screaming toddlers, something called the Tower of Beer PowerOrder: Joan Jett veggie burger for him, cheeseburger in a lettuce wrap for you, sweet potato friesGreat for: Seeing yourselves 10 years from now; quietly panicking.4. Fishmonger\u2019s [NOW CLOSED]Vibe: Linoleum fabulous, Bulls game blaring, reportedly unpaid back taxesOrder: Grilled whatever\u2019s-on-the-specials-board, baked potato, buttered snap peasGreat for: Staring across the table on Valentine\u2019s Day and knowing it\u2019s only a matter of time.5. Geer Street GardenVibe: Converted gas station\u2013chic, makes parents feel coolOrder: Cobb salad, creamy vinaigrette on the side; glass or three of ChardonnayGreat for: Meeting your two best friends immediately post breakup and smoking cigarettes on the patio even though you definitely quit.6. Dos PerrosVibe: Getting drunk alone, but in a classy wayOrder: Three tacos for $12 and at least two $5 margaritas (Sunday and Monday nights only)Great for: Convincing yourself that you\u2019re fine, totally fine, you just need to be alone for a while, and hey, who is that very attractive bartender who is definitely new in town?7. Pizzeria ToroVibe: Wannabe Brooklyn, including the wait; eye-rollingly worth itOrder: Pizza with Meyer lemon, Saracena olives, dried chiles, and Crescenza; wishing they had pepperoniGreat for: Snagging a window seat with the person you met on Tinder, hoping your ex (or at least his friends) walk by.8. The FederalVibe: Apathetically cooler than you, just townie enoughOrder: Nachos (add guacamole); whatever draft beer is cheapest tonightGreat for: Running into your ex totally by accident, you swear, you had no idea he\u2019d be at this place that happens to be his favorite, then letting him buy you a drink because it\u2019s Wednesday, and why the hell not? You\u2019re moving back to New York soon anyway.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Explore Bon App\u00e9titNeighborhood RestaurantsDurhamRecipes you want to make.
