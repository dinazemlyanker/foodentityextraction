This egg salad is ultra-lush thanks to Kewpie mayonnaise, which is made with egg yolks only (traditional mayo uses whole eggs). It\u2019s offset with fragrant, earthy curry powder, fresh mixed herbs, and the crunch of fried bread. We like Madras curry powder because it has a bit of extra heat, but you can use regular curry powder and cayenne pepper to your taste if you prefer.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Ive also always used curry in my egg salad and m deviled eggs.Hellmann's has always been my go to. Tried Duke's and didn't taste right to me. I believe my palate didn't care for the oil in it. Maybe it's just being a Yankee. The radishes are a great addition.Nancy Scott2/20/2022Delicious recipe.  Followed as is (but I didn't have any radish) and it was perfect.  MinihToronto, ON1/9/2022This turned out delicious! A perfect late morning breakfast on a Sunday. I\u2019m not a big fan of mayonnaise so I just used some leftover \u201clight\u201d mayo from Kroger instead of buying something new; next time I might try Greek yogurt which is my usual substitute for mayo. I think the radishes are absolutely necessary! They give a pleasant little crunch on top of the egg salad. KlavyHouston, Texas1/9/2022I recently made a similar egg salad with toast. I cut up radish, red pepper, and tomato really small & rough cut some boiled eggs. After adding a little greek yogurt I used a little bit of coriander & S&P to season. Delicious!Anonymous12/20/2021Interesting receipe. I will note that traditional mayonnaise is NOT  made with whole eggs, it's made with egg yolks. Duke's mayonnaise (made by Sauer's) is made with yolks and readily available throughout most of the U.S. South.Leon JesterSouth Central Virginia12/19/2021Can\u2019t wait to try.\nLooks and sounds deeee-lish!AnonymousPalm Springs 12/19/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titBreakfastLunchDinnerSnackMainStarterEasyQuickWeeknight MealsVegetarianDairy-FreeToastEggRecipes you want to make.
