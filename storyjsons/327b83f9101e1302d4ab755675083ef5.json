Why haven't we listened?By Mari UyeharaAugust 24, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailA few months ago, when I peeked into my parents\u2019 refrigerator, I was a bit surprised to find what I thought was a health-food anachronism: low-fat yogurt. There was not one but two different kinds, as my mother prefers Greek and my father plain. I thought everyone had heard that the whole low-fat thing was bunk and whole fat was the way to go. But the ups and downs of health news can be confusing; my busy parents, who both have graduate degrees, read widely, and cook copiously, didn\u2019t know. And they\u2019re not alone.Later that week, I visited Whole Foods, looking to swap out their low-fat tubs for the good stuff, but when I stooped down to scan the bottom row of the refrigerated case, I found slim pickings. While there were all sorts of brands and flavors of low-fat yogurt, there were only a few measly tubs of the whole fat. At coffeeshops, too, I noticed plenty of patrons ordering their cappuccinos and lattes with low-fat. As it turns out, the low-fat mantra was no anachronism, even though the science on dairy has pretty much turned it on its head.Just recently, a study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, found that there is no link between higher fat dairy intake and mortality\u2014and, in fact, higher whole-fat dairy intake may guard against strokes. But beyond that, other studies have established that whole-fat dairy is actually better for you than its skimpier brethren. A study found that it lowered the risk of being overweight or obese by 8 percent. That may be because the fat keeps you satisfied for longer or it may be that the milk fats contain some magical substances that help us burn calories more quickly. Another study of 3,333 (!) adults for Circulation found that the full-fat dairy eaters had a 46 percent lower risk of getting diabetes. And on top of that, one of the strongest links between diet and acne is skim milk, which may increase blood sugar levels and therefore trigger hormones, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. In short, low-fat dairy may increase the risk of diabetes, weight gain, strokes, and acne.So, what led us to this state of confusion?Dr. Marcia Otto, assistant professor at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and one of the researchers on the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition study, told me that a few studies in the 1970s found a positive correlation between intake of saturated fat (the type of fat in dairy products) and heart disease: a hypothesis. But later, better designed studies found that saturated fat increased both good and bad cholesterol. Because it raises bad cholesterol, the perception set in that it was bad for cholesterol. But what matters with cholesterol is the ratio, not the individual cholesterol numbers, and when both were raised, the net effect is zero. In other words, when it comes to fatty dairy and your HDL/LDL levels, it\u2019s all good.\u201cDairy has important benefits to health,\u201d says Dr. Otto. \u201cNutrients like calcium, potassium, and vitamins A, B-12, and D.\u201d And fat helps you better absorb those nutrients.The other thing about whole-fat dairy is that, well, it\u2019s just more delicious. Only luscious whole milk\u2014you know, the small-farm, pasture-grazed sort\u2014can give you those bright, grassy notes that change along with the seasonal feed; they just don\u2019t come through with skim, whether it\u2019s from a factory farm or a farm around the way. Nothing beats the full-bodied richness of whole milk in an espresso-based drink, where it tempers the coffee\u2019s bitter notes. Yogurt, too, is its best self in full-fat, full-flavor form: Its tang is rounded out and the texture more plush, whether you\u2019re mixing it in a chia pudding for breakfast, folding it into a tangy chicken salad, or adding a dollop to roasted meats.I remember way back in the \u201980s when epidemiologists called the French diet, rich in saturated fats and buttery cheeses, \u201cthe French paradox\u201d for the perplexingly low rates of associated heart disease. The French had it right. Taking your cafe au lait with full-fat milk or packing an extra creamy cheese on a picnic is a-okay if you\u2019re already eating a diet full of fish, vegetables, and nutrient-dense grains. More and more, our nutrition science is just catching up with the wisdom of some old foodways. Now, if only we could catch up on that  35-hour work week too.Cook with whole-fat yogurt:Hot-Smoked Salmon with Salted Yogurt and FennelThis is entr\u00e9e you want to serve to guests when you have no time to cook and have no desire to turn on the oven.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titDairyYogurtGreek YogurtHealthyishTrendsRead MoreLifestyleHow Mayonnaise Got Its Groove BackBy Flora TsapovskyRecipes you want to make.
