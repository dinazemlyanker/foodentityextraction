Well, it wasn\u2019t that violent. Instead of a sword, there were tweezers. Menus in stanzas. Food that brought people to tears. Her years of hard work, her unique vision, were finally recognized when she earned her third Michelin star for her San Francisco restaurant Atelier Crenn the only way she knows how: being her damn self. The headline read, \u201cDOMINIQUE CRENN IS THE FIRST AMERICAN WOMAN TO EARN 3 MICHELIN STARS.\u201d And by slaying the three-starred dragon, it can now be officially normal for a female chef to stack Michelin stars like the rest of them.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.When Crenn was awarded Best Female Chef by The World's 50 Best Restaurants in 2016, she denounced the sexist category as \u201cstupid,\u201d and later wrote an op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle about the lack of gender diversity in restaurant kitchens. While all press around the Michelin award focused on the FEMALE news (she was the first woman in America, and one of only a few in the world, to win three stars), this award celebrated her food, and her vision. She was inundated with flowers and emails from young female cooks, pumped up by her win, by her example. Can\u2019t this just be normal already?Crenn\u2019s wine bar, Bar Crenn, grabbed a star as well\u2014not a bad haul for the French-born chef whose first fine-dining gig was at Jeremiah Tower\u2019s Stars. (Coincidence? I think so!) I spoke to Crenn a few weeks ago, right before she turned off her phone and spent the weekend in complete chill mode: spa, sauna, massage, facial, \u201chours of nothing,\u201d and time at her farm in Sonoma. This year she was in a focused place, and perhaps the Michelin inspectors noticed, she said. A former inspector sent her a note of congratulations that spilled some beans: We\u2019ve been following your career since 2006, she wrote. You\u2019ve been on our radar for 12 years, and we\u2019ve seen you grow, but we also saw you stay true to who you are.Crenn felt seen. They get it. I\u2019m not budging. Her food is meticulous, inspired, and surreal. At Atelier Crenn, the menu is a long poem that comes to life on the plate. The meal unfolds, dishes that look like little birds\u2019 nests and potted plants. If magical realism were a genre of food, it would apply here. But behind the scenes, the chefs at Crenn\u2019s restaurants sing and dance in the kitchen all the time (follow along on IG). \u201cI created my own world! People who know me closely know I\u2019m very silly, I\u2019m very goofy, I bring that to my space.\u201d I asked her if any past kitchens she worked in broke into dance parties, which got a quick, Uh, no. \u201cI left a company that was very dismissing,\u201d she said.Her latest, Bar Crenn, was inspired by post-WWII Parisian caf\u00e9s, places where people gathered to drink and talk about culture, politics, what the hell is going on in this crazy world. \u201cIt was a hard time in the story of the world,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it was also a time when amazing art came out. We are also living in a time that is not easy.\u201d Not a lot of restaurateurs plan new spots thinking about the context of the current time, their restaurant\u2019s place in the world right now. Crenn\u2019s head works differently. \u201cPeople are very disconnected from each other, I wanted a place where people have a glass of wine, be loungy, and talk to each other.\u201d And maybe, she hoped, that creative space would inspire something beyond the meal. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if people would get it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut Michelin did, Esquire, USA Today\u2026\u201dBefore 2018 ended with a three-star bang, she was already snagging best-of lists, a James Beard award, and the cover of San Francisco Magazine\u2019s best chefs awards issue, in which she won restaurateur of the year. She was hosting a female chef centric dinner series with Resy, speaking out about #MeToo in the restaurant industry, working on a memoir, a documentary, and planning her next move. There\u2019s got to be at least 25 other things I missed.Now she\u2019s got her sights set beyond the Michelin man. Some big upcoming projects are sizzling, but unannounced as of yet. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to realize your purpose in life. Mine isn\u2019t cooking,\u201d she says. \u201cCooking is a platform. My purpose is trying to understand humanity and be a part of this moment in time, forging a better world for the next generation. It\u2019s tricky right now\u2014we\u2019re in trouble. I\u2019m trying to do everything I can for my community, for the next generation. You have to keep that brightness inside of you, and be engaged with others. If I didn\u2019t have that, I\u2019d die.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titChefsRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
