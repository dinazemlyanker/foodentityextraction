Here's how to buy olive oil that you can feel great about, without breaking the bank.By Claire SaffitzJanuary 26, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailI used to buy olive oil the way I bought wine\u2014I\u2019d just choose a bottle from the lower-middle price range that had a cool label. (Sort of how I still choose wine, tbh...) I generally looked for words that sounded good to me like \u201cfirst cold press\u201d and \u201cextra virgin,\u201d but didn\u2019t know exactly know what I was buying. Then I worked on big, deep-dive story about olive oil for Bon App\u00e9tit and realized that picking a decent bottle\u2014even just one that wasn\u2019t rancid or poorly processed\u2014is actually pretty tricky. The good news is that getting quality product really just comes down to being able to read a label and decipher some lingo. Now that I know how to buy olive oil, I've vowed to never carelessly sling a random bottle into my grocery cart ever again\u2014and neither should you. Here's what you need to know.Extra-Virgin or Bust\u201cExtra-virgin\u201d is the highest designation of quality given to olive oil, meaning it\u2019s unrefined, free of chemicals and other \u201cdefects\u201d like rancidity, and never treated with heat. Quality can still vary within the extra-virgin category, but without intimate preexisting knowledge of individual olive oil brands, it\u2019s as close as you're going to get to an overall guarantee of purity you can get off a label. Look for those two words, and you've already eliminated a vast array of crappy bottles.Stay Away From the \"Light\"Oil is, by definition, 100% fat\u2014there is no such thing as a \"low fat\" olive oil. \u201cLight olive oil\u201d is a misnomer and a marketing ploy that actually means the oil has been refined and treated with heat to strip away odor and flavor. If you're looking for an oil that doesn't taste or smell like anything, you're better off buying a cheap neutral oil like peanut or grapeseed.Don't even think about making this ultra-moist olive oil cake with crappy olive oil.\nPhoto by Alex LauRead the Fine Print:Be skeptical of suspiciously inexpensive oils labeled \u201cProduct of Italy.\u201d It\u2019s likely that the olives themselves weren\u2019t grown or pressed there. Companies are required to label an oil\u2019s source, but that could just mean where it gets put into bottles\u2014a loophole that allows disingenuous producers to buy lousy, defective oil from all around the world and pretend it is from Italy. Look carefully on the back label for the initials of the true country of origin: IT for Italy, GR for Greece, etc. As a rule of thumb, you're better off buying olive oil that comes from a single place\u2014ideally one farm or collective, but at the very least one country.Color Is Key (But Not Where You Think)It\u2019s a myth that the darker and greener an oil, the higher the quality. That said, you shouldn\u2019t even be able to tell the color of an oil from the bottle: The bottle itself should be opaque, made of either dark glass or metal. Contrary to what most people think, olive oil actually goes bad fairly quickly, and exposure to light and heat will make the quality deteriorate even more quickly. A company that cares about the quality of its product isn't going to put olive oil in a clear glass bottle, ever.Now that you know how to buy olive oil that doesn't suck, go marinate some olives already:Marinated Olives and FetaAn appetizer you can have it ready within 10 minutes of walking in the door.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titOlive OilBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
