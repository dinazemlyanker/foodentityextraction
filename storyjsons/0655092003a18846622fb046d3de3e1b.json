In \"There's No Better Time To...\" we'll share the little projects we're finally getting around to. This week: Coping with cookbooks.In the time I\u2019ve worked in food media, I\u2019ve heard other people say they read cookbooks like book-books, and I always had the same response: eye roll, yeah right, so annoying. If I was going to make the time to read anything from cover to cover, it would be a real book, thought judgy me. My cookbooks stayed in the kitchen, where I, you know, cooked from them. Of course, it took a worldwide lockdown to change my mind.When I got sick with what I think was COVID-19, my already high baseline of anxiety shot up like the price of Purell. I found it impossible to concentrate on anything except, sorry to get dark here, my own mortality. Not even Tiger King could distract me. Reading books was completely out of the question, and so was cooking\u2014I could hardly muster the enthusiasm to open my fridge.One afternoon, sitting on my couch writing a work email, I was graced with my first-ever panic attack\u2014heart volleying in my chest, arms tingling, a wash of cold from the crown of my head. My laptop dropped to the floor as I slumped onto my back, ready to pass out. Luckily I didn\u2019t, and the whole thing was over in barely a minute. After calling my mom and sobbing into my couch cushion for what felt like days but was actually probably 20 minutes, I turned my head to the stack of cookbooks under my coffee table. I saw Mark Bittman\u2019s iconic tome, How to Cook Everything\u2014the honeybee-yellow \u201cCompletely Revised Twentieth Anniversary Edition\u201d to be precise\u2014and felt an overwhelming urge to open it.I flipped to a random page and read a sidebar: \u201c15 Thirty-Second Ways to Jazz Up Plain Rice.\u201d (\u201c1. Stir in a tablespoon or more butter.\u201d) Further down the page, I read a section called The Basics of Rice Pilaf. It was boring, but I found myself taking deeper breaths. On the next page, I read a recipe for Chicken Paella. (\u201cSometimes perceived as a major production, paella is nothing more than a combination of rice and something else.\u201d) I read another sidebar, \u201c17 Grain Dishes That Make Good Leftovers.\u201d I flipped to one of the recipes: Stuck-Pot Rice with Potato Crust. I read the recipe and Bittman\u2019s suggested variation (swap the potato for pita). I had no desire to make it, but I felt oddly calm.Mark has so many ideas for jazzing up plain rice.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesNo shade to Mark, but I don\u2019t use HTCE much for cooking. I consult it for things like bread-baking (okay, I did that once) and for his fried-rice technique, but I gravitate toward cookbooks that are more curated than encyclopedic. But ever since Panic Attack Day, it\u2019s been my most effective form of therapy, second only to actual therapy. In moments when the anxiety starts bubbling in my chest, I open to a random page and read it through. I\u2019ve read the recipe for Bean Griddlecakes (\u201cThese are amazing,\u201d begins the headnote), as well as \u201c10 Additions to Bean Griddlecakes\u201d and \u201c6 Sauces for Bean Griddlecakes.\u201d I know \u201cWhat to Expect from Whole Wheat Pasta\u201d and how Mark suggests removing a fish head (\u201cUse a mallet to pound the knife through the backbone, if necessary\u201d). I\u2019ve read all about \u201cComforting Soups\u201d and have not made a single one.A common strategy for dealing with panic attacks, I\u2019ve learned recently, is something called the 5-4-3-2-1 method. You find 5 things to see, 4 things to feel, 3 things to hear, 2 things to smell, and 1 thing to taste. The idea is to get your brain away from Anxietyland and back to the immediate present by focusing on what\u2019s around you. I think reading HTCE works in a similar way. My eyes are focused on a page, my hands on holding a solid (and quite heavy) object, and my mind on the food I\u2019m reading about: how the ingredients come together, how the dish might smell and taste, the texture of it in my mouth.Since HTCE became my panic-reduction strategy, I\u2019ve found myself flipping through it, and even other cookbooks, in calmer moments too. It\u2019s the kind of soft-focus activity that I think a lot of us are craving right now, like knitting, coloring, and looking at photos of Stanley Tucci. I\u2019m still not reading cookbooks cover-to-cover and probably never will, but I am sorry for judging all you people who do. We each find comfort in different ways, and, right now at least, I\u2019m finding it in \u201c13 Sauces to Make with Mayonnaise\u201d on page 70.Explore Bon App\u00e9titThere's No Better Time CoronavirusRecipes you want to make.
