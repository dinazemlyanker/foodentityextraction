Transition lenses. Compostable straws made of hay. There are many inventions in this modern era that deserve our respect, adoration, and credit card numbers, but none are as utterly silly and wonderful as the inflatable flamingo drink holder. It\u2019s literally full of hot air. And I\u2019m 100 percent on board. I don\u2019t even have a pool.I\u2019m obsessed with these things. I keep seeing them everywhere. Even at the BEACH, which is INSANE. The waves\u2014are you crazy? I don\u2019t need saltwater in my CANNED CUPCAKE CHARDONNAY. (Maybe I do?) Still, I\u2019d like to believe that somewhere on a distant island, someone is sending a long love letter rolled up into a can of Canada Dry via an inflatable flamingo drink holder.This is the perfect invention in this bullshit digital age with no end in sight. It provides a service you didn\u2019t know you needed while only really existing in order to be photographed. I love that. Like a lot of things in life, it\u2019s ridiculous and hollow, but the second that bothers you, you\u2019re dead. Embrace the frivolity! You know what problems I have? One: Getting thirsty when I\u2019m in a giant body of water. PARCHED. Two: I\u2019m physically attached to my phone, so much so that I have it with me in and around giant bodies of water. Cut to: Me in a full-coverage bikini, capturing the moment when my Barq\u2019s floats by in a pink flotation device. Posts to Instagram \ud83c\udfd6\ufe0f\ud83c\udf49\ud83c\udf24\ufe0f\ud83c\udf0aI am, however, a woman of little influence. But each time a real celebrity or Instagram influencer type posts a pool selfie with a drink floatie, 100 more spawn and pop up in every above-ground pool from here to Corpus Christi. These things are more viral than that weird rash the entire swim team got in 2006, which was VERY VIRAL. A pack of 36 goes for $23 on Amazon right now. How many do you need?\u201cHow many do you need,\u201d Sharon Hershkowitz, who owns Manhattan\u2019s iconic inflatable paradise Balloon Saloon, asks me when I inquire how many flamingo drink floaties she currently has in stock. (MANY.) She told me that they sell these floaties for your Fresca by the THOUSANDS.\u201cCelebs use them in their pool videos, their Instagrams, when they\u2019re in the Hamptons or wherever,\u201d she says in a heavy New Yawk accent, and then they sell faster than happy hour fros\u00e9 at a rooftop bar. She wouldn\u2019t tell me the company that makes them (\u201cyou think I\u2019d give away our secrets?\u201d), but the flamingos are the most popular, with unicorns coming in at a close second. She\u2019s tested them out and they never topple over, she swears to me, and they\u2019re \u201calways at your beck and call.\u201d Assuming, I guess, there isn\u2019t a gust of wind or an unexpected cannonball. She owns a few puppy floats and a hunk, a grimacing inflatable muscle man in sunglasses and sailor pants who straddles your Spiked Seltzer. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want a hunk floating next to them?\u201dCoincidentally, I spoke to Peter Tanoury, a partner at GoFloats, which manufactures flamingo drink floaties (and their larger, human sized flamingo inner tubes are beloved by the Kardashians, Dave Navarro, and Moby, per Peter). He told me that they started selling the drink floaties in 2014. Other companies made them before, but cheaply (cough, that 36-pack). You can tell it\u2019s budget kind when someone has their hand on their drink, keeping it from capsizing. GoFloats increased the size and made them sturdier, a public service. \u201cOur sales of GoFloats\u00ae authentic drink floats are still up year over year,\u201d he said, explaining that the original flamingo drink float was so popular that they came out with an entire line of designs. But not the hunk, he disclosed. They\u2019re not responsible for that one.So please, do yourself a personal party favor and stock up on these inflatable drink holders before it\u2019s too late. Soon\u2014not sure if you\u2019ve heard\u2014the planet will be covered in rising waters, coffee tables will be deemed irrelevant, and the only option we\u2019ll have is to rest our weary refreshments on floating flamingos. And you thought they were silly.Buy it: GoFloats Inflatable Pool Drink Holders (3 Pack), $10 on AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titTrendsSummerShoppingSummer DrinksRecipes you want to make.
