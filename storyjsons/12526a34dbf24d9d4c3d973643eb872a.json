Quichiz\u2019s mother is Colombian and her father is Peruvian; she grew up in Queens, eating mostly Colombian food and staples like corn and sweet potatoes. In the time since Veggie Mijas started, she\u2019s helped the network grow to include chapters in Los Angeles, Miami, and Philadelphia.This Thanksgiving, local organizers in Chicago are hosting a Friendsgiving potluck to celebrate indigenous resilience. Along with guided breathing exercises and plenty of food, the event is a reminder to \"listen to the indigenous community, provide resources, and be gentle with our triggers and traumas. It means celebrating our resilience, our strengths and our weakness and being there for one another,\u201d says Quichiz.Between her Veggie Mijas duties and a day job at a sexual health center, Quichiz knows that it\u2019s important to take care of herself before helping others. On any given day, you can find her perfecting her feel-good bedtime routine, which usually involves trap music, skincare, and comfort food. Here\u2019s how else she calls it a night.Quichiz journaling before bed.\nStorytimeI listen to Locatora Radio, hosted by two great femmes of color, Diosa and Mala, who live in Los Angeles. It\u2019s all about creating radical movements and documenting our legacies. I also listen to Radio Ambulante, an NPR special, where folks from all over the world tell their incredible stories of survival. Most of the time, I cry a lot hearing stories about Colombian women losing their children in environmental or borderland displacements. I love listening to both because there is a balance between reality and escapism.Just add disco lightsWhen I'm in my room, I turn the lights off, put on my disco lights, and dance all my stress away. I dance for like an hour. Currently I am listening to Por Ti and No Me Encuentras, by Tatiana Hazel, a Chicana artist from Chicago. I also dance to MIA by Bad Bunny and Drake, and of course, all of the Isolation album by Kali Uchis.Daily temperature checkI try to write in my journal. I journal every other day and have been writing diary entries since I was 6 years old. I try to write out how I feel, what's going well, what's not going well, just so I can have that record. I also like to read Love Poems by Pablo Neruda.Leaning into face-maskingBefore I go to bed, I wear a face mask. I really love this one called Face to the World by Loba Loca, a queer South American migrant artist. Whenever I shower, I place some herb powder on my palm and rub it lightly on my face. It\u2019s oatmeal based, scrubbed with tonic and cleansing organic powder herbs. I also love the Milk Jelly Cleanser, Mega Greens Galaxy, and Moisturizing Moon Mask from Glossier, and the Cup o' Coffee mask from Lush. I place my face masks in the freezer alongside my pink jade face roller and wait 20 minutes before putting it on. The coolness of the jade gets rid of that extra stress.Quichiz dancing the stress away.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanSelf-preservation and spiritualityOn difficult days, I let myself cry. I also do meditation. I lay out my yoga mat and practice a few breathing techniques and play soft music. This is a moment when I give recognition to myself and God for allowing me to have another day in this life.Scented candles and sweatpantsBefore I go to bed, I always prepare myself a Yogi Bedtime Tea. My girlfriend uses the Figuier scented Diptyque candle, which I love because it smells like a warm winter and makes me want to cuddle and go to sleep. I love coming home and wearing my \"Dressed To Chill\" sweatpants from Chillhouse. They are so cute and the softest, most comfortable thing to wear after a long day.Explore Bon App\u00e9titGoing to Bed withInterviewsHealthyishRead MoreLifestyleHilton Dresden Eats Tuna Melts in Bed and Sketches to Fall AsleepBy Martine ThompsonRecipes you want to make.
