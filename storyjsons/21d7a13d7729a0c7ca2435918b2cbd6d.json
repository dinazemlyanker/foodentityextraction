With their bright candy-colored handles, they\u2019re an unmistakable addition to food stylists\u2019 kits, restaurant kitchens, and the work stations of every BA food editor. Once I noticed the scissors\u2014which, at about 6 inches long, are small enough to fit comfortably into a back pocket\u2014I started seeing them everywhere I looked (they even make a cameo in the first episode of Gourmet Makes!).So when I left my full-time editing job to work in pastry kitchens and as a food stylist, I wanted to join the club. I may have kept my mini offset and my eye-droppers in a beat-up shoebox instead of in a professional-looking knife roll, but at least I\u2019d have the scissors to prove I was kinda-sorta legit (or trying to be).Twenty bucks felt like a splurge for seemingly diminutive scissors but as soon as I started using them, I understood the hype: A pair of Joyce Chen scissors eliminates the need, at least in most cases, for big honking shears.Much of the reason these little scissors are so handy (and worth the price) is actually because the blades are short (only three-inches-long!) and strong (made of rust-resistant stainless steel!), making them handy for tasks that require precision, strength, or a combination of both. They cut through girthy poultry bones but also trim delicate puff pastry; they break down woody stems but can also remove one minuscule flower petal. Because the blades are small, they work almost as super-sharp extensions of your fingers\u2014you can get up close and personal with your food, whether you\u2019re breaking down a chicken or cutting gnocchi off a rope. The big-looped handles can accommodate nearly any grip (left or right handed!), making the scissors comfortable to hold and easy to maneuver.Because the stainless steel blades are super sharp (and can be sharpened on a stone if they dull), the scissors excel where a knife might fail or waver: cutting raw bacon or guanciale into neat strips for carbonara, shaping phyllo dough without roughing up the edges, and, as senior associate food editor Molly Baz recommends, zipping through herbs without dirtying a cutting board. They\u2019re so exact that they make senior food editor Andy Baraghani, who uses them to get \u201cthe perfect snip of a basil leaf off the stem\u201d (okay, Andy) and remove the smallest fish bones, feel like a surgeon.So cute! So strong!\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigBut Joyce Chen scissors aren\u2019t only for heavy-duty cooking and baking tasks: At my most recent restaurant job, we kept a pair in the kitchen exclusively for cutting tiny and perfectly straight labels for quart containers. Senior food editor Anna Stockwell\u2019s mom swears by Joyce Chen scissors for cutting through branches and making teeny trims for floral arrangements. Amazon customers say that they\u2019re even handy for metalsmithing (and that, folks, is why they\u2019re named \u201cunlimited\u201d).I use my own pair to trim radishes and carrots, cut parchment paper, devein shrimp, remove some fat from pork chops, break up sticky dried fruits like raisins and figs, and make slits in double-crust pies. But I often have to fish them out of my knitting bag, where I\u2019ve stowed them after trimming yarn. They\u2019re so delightful to use, I walk around my apartment just looking for excuses to snip and trim. I haven\u2019t torn open a bag of potato chips in years!Consider me a full-fledged member of the Joyce Chen cult\u2014and yes, I\u2019m trying to recruit you too.Photo by Chelsie Craig Joyce Chen Unlimited Scissors$30 $19 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingToolsRecipes you want to make.
