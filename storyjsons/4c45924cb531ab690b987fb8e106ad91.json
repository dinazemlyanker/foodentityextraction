But sometimes interest is so obvious, it would be impossible not to notice it. This is the case with adaptogenic herbs, and most notably with ashwagandha.Ashwagandha root is undeniably the most prolific adaptogen, thought to strengthen the body\u2019s ability to cope with stress. Who wouldn\u2019t want that? Unsurprisingly, our shelves overfloweth with ashwagandha products. Still, all-time interest doesn\u2019t always translate into knowledge. What exactly does ashwagandha do, and how do we ensure we\u2019re taking it right? Read on and chill out.What are adaptogens?Adaptogens are often called \u201cancient herbs,\u201d but the idea of an \"adaptogen\" is fairly modern. Adaptogenic plants like ashwagandha and rodhiola have been used for hundreds of years around the world, but the term itself was coined by Soviet toxicologist N. V. Lazarev in 1947. He aimed to describe substances with \u201cnon-specific\u201d resistance to adverse influences like stress\u2014in other words, plants that keep us calm. For more information on adaptogens, check out our primer here.Okay, what is ashwagandha?Ashwagandha is an adaptogen that\u2019s a member of the nightshade family, and thus a distant cousin to tomatoes and eggplants. It also goes by Withania somnifera, Indian ginseng, and winter cherry. Herbal medicine commonly uses gnarled ashwagandha root, which is turned into powders, tinctures, and even added to moon milk for an added dose of doze.Ashwagandha root from Furnace Creek Farms.\nPhoto by Alex LauWhat does it do?Ashwagandha has been used in medical practices like Aryuveda,\na medical system that originated in India over 3,000 years ago, to fight stress, boost endurance, and promote a general sense of calm. While science is limited, modern studies reinforce ashwagandha\u2019s potential to reduce stress and anxiety in adults. The ability to adapt to the stress of daily life has undeniable appeal, but that doesn\u2019t mean we all should be dosing up on ashwagandha before wrestling with the subway in rush hour.\u201cI\u2019m careful to make sure this is the right plant for the person,\u201d says holistic health practitioner Rachelle Robinett of Supernatural Cafe at WOOM Center.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the more calming adaptogens, which can be great if we\u2019re overstressed and over-producing cortisol and adrenaline, but for people who have low energy it might be counterproductive and that\u2019s often under-communicated.\u201dHow should I take it?If you do decide to try ashwagandha, start out by looking for a good product. Tinctures and capsules make it easy to ensure you take the right dose regularly, but Robinett recommends using powdered ashwagandha root if you can. \u201cI like to stay as close to the whole form as possible,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen taking pills we start to lose the relationship with the plant\u2014we don\u2019t know what it tastes like, we don\u2019t know what color it is, or what it smells like.\u201d Ashwagandha products can be found online, at herbal medicine stores, and even at some farmers' markets. (For New Yorkers, Robinett recommends buying from herbalist Grace Galanti of Furnace Creek Farms at various greenmarkets.)Robinett recommends taking half a teaspoon of powdered ashwagandha root daily, but it\u2019s important to check any product\u2019s packaging as concentrations can vary. Like multivitamins or CBD, it\u2019s important to take measured doses of ashwagandha regularly for long periods of time. \u201cWhen you take it in a tea here and there, it\u2019s not doing the things you think it\u2019s doing. That\u2019s more for fun,\u201d says Dr. Amy Shah, MD. \u201cI think that if you really want to have noticeable benefit you would take it every day for about three months.\u201dOver time, you should expect to feel changes like an increase in calm, extra energy, or bolstered endurance. Effects can vary, and increase over time. \u201c[Ashwagandha] isn't meant to be used as a spot treatment, it\u2019s meant to be used consistently and regularly,\u201d says Robinett. \u201cGive it a long runway. People don\u2019t notice change until something drastic happens in their life or day they realize they responded it a more tranquil manner than they might have otherwise.\u201dWhen should I stop?Ashwagandha is one example of an herb that can be taken for long periods of time, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should plan to lace your morning oat milk latte with ashwagandha for the rest of your life. Robinett recommends taking a break from ashwagandha once you\u2019ve been taking the herb for about a year, to check in with your body and assess your needs. \u201cThe goal with plant-based medicine is to repair our system and get back to a place where we\u2019re balanced on our own,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not to be dependent on 15 herbs every single day in order to function.\u201d To learn more about ashwagandha, adaptogens, and other healing herbs, make an appointment with an herbalist near you.Cook with ashwagandha:Steamed Fish in Clay PotAngela Dimayuga of Mission Chinese Food likes using whole dried ashwagandha root in this clay pot dinner.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishTrendsRead MoreLifestyleWhat Are Adaptogens, and Why Is Everyone Talking About Them?By Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
