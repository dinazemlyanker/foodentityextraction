Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you\u2019ll get the scoop before everyone else.Dear Healthyish friends,In an attempt to stave off quarantine boredom, shave a few bucks off my monthly grocery bill, and use up the growing stockpile of dried beans in my pantry, I gave myself a cooking challenge for the month of November. The idea was to cook all my meals using only pantry staples, condiments, and a modest amount of fresh produce. I reorganized and relabeled everything in my pantry and made a list of all the recipes I wanted to cook.And then this week happened, and my plans of eating nothing but lentils and oats and eggs galore promptly went to shit. I ordered takeout multiple days in a row, living in a blur of anxiety, carbs, the news, stress, and more carbs. When I did cook, I barely did more than heat up a tortilla and melt a blanket of cheese on top. There\u2019s a mountain of kale in the fridge that I can\u2019t bear to look at (much less cook), and I know it\u2019s dying a slow, wilty death.I'm putting the beans (and the eating plans) aside for now.\nInstead of guilting myself for letting the kale go bad or stressing about spending money on takeout, I\u2019m trying to give myself a pass on life this week. Since this whole thing began, I\u2019ve noticed I often try to uphold my pre-pandemic standards\u2014of cooking, living, working, and being. I have to fight to remember that the nonstop pace of that life is no longer realistic in a world where compounded stress, anxiety, and fear of the unknown are the new normal. And as someone who uses cooking and diet as a means of coping with anxiety and creating order from chaos, I\u2019m trying my damndest to convince myself that, when my food plans don\u2019t work out, that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ve failed. It just means I needed to go in a different direction. And that\u2019s...okay.\u00a0So about that ill-fated November pantry challenge: I\u2019ve scrapped that plan, at least in its original iteration. I\u2019m still going to try to cook out of my pantry when I can (more on how that\u2019s going next time), but I won\u2019t try to force it on the days when all I want is khao soy from my favorite Thai spot. The only plan I have is to stress less.I hope you give yourself a pass too,Christina ChaeyAssociate editorP.S.
