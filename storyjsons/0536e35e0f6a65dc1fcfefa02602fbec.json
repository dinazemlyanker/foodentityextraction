When something\u2019s so easy to make that you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.Fusion is a word that\u2019s come to imply a lack of authenticity, but much of the culture of Hawai\u2019i is itself a hybrid, and the plate lunch is a beautiful reflection of that. A kind of bento box\u2014like take-out meal, plate lunch was originally eaten by laborers. Today, you can roll up to drive-ins and food wagons across the islands for a styrofoam container loaded with two scoops of white rice, mayo-laden macaroni salad, and an entr\u00e9e\u2014to name just a few, katsu, kalua pig, and cold ginger chicken, or shoyu chicken.Sweet and salty, shoyu chicken is made by simmering chicken in an aromatic broth of ginger, garlic, Mr. Yoshida\u2019s sauce (or soy sauce plus brown sugar), and mirin. The word shoyu in the name refers to Japanese-style soy sauce, and the flavor of the dish as a whole is similar to that of teriyaki. Still, the \u201cofficial\u201d origins of the recipe are hard to trace. Like many dishes in Hawai\u2019i, shoyu chicken is an amalgamation of tastes brought together by immigrants from China, Portugal, Japan, the Philippines, Korea, and Puerto Rico who began traveling here to work the fruit and sugar plantations in the 1850s.I don\u2019t remember the first time I ate shoyu chicken; when I was growing up in Hawai\u2019i, it was one of those ubiquitous dishes that was always around. My mom had three kids to feed and my dad was always working\u2014this was a meal she could easily throw together with only a pot and a handful of staples. It can feed mass amounts of people in a short time and you don\u2019t have to be too precious about quantities; most combinations of the core ingredients will result in moist, flavorful meat. In many ways shoyu chicken is really about abundance and communion.My mom\u2019s recipe deviates a little from the plate lunch entr\u00e9e because she tends to let the sauce caramelize longer so it\u2019s thicker and the flavors feel more concentrated. I personally like to go heavier on the ginger and garlic than what my mom\u2019s recipe calls for, but you can adjust the quantities to your own tastes.Here\u2019s how to make shoyu chicken:Place a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat and coat the base with vegetable oil. Slice up a 2-inch piece ginger and smash 3\u20134 garlic cloves, then stir-fry them in the oil until they\u2019re aromatic. (Note: More ginger equals more heat.) Add 1 cup Mr. Yoshida\u2019s sauce or 1 cup shoyu plus \u00be cup brown sugar, 1 cup water, and \u00bd cup mirin to the pot, and bring the liquid to a boil. Transfer 3 lb. bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, wings, or drumsticks into the pot. When the liquid returns to a boil, reduce the heat, cover the pot, and simmer chicken for about 30 minutes. Remove cover and simmer for another 15 minutes or until the sauce has noticeably thickened. After serving, top the chicken with chopped scallions.Growing up, I remember eating shoyu chicken drumsticks ravenously with my hands, but there are plenty of ways to serve it. Mac salad is a classic pairing; it lends a cold, creamy texture that cuts some of the saltiness perfectly. In my family, there was always cooked white rice present to soak up the umami-rich sauce, plus a side of canned sweet corn.This is the first time my mom\u2019s recipe has been written down\u2014shoyu chicken is a dish that was passed down orally\u2014and she was actually reluctant to share it. She said it\u2019s \u201ctoo simple,\u201d a dinner she would make when she was feeling tired or busy. But that\u2019s exactly the point for me. Over the last year, especially as my zest for culinary experiments wanes, I\u2019ve been making shoyu chicken more often. Each time the end result varies just a little. But it always delivers a kind of easy, homey comfort\u2014something I can\u2019t get enough of these days.Mitchell Kuga is a culture writer based in Honolulu, Hawai\u2019i.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimpleChickenHawaiiRecipes you want to make.
