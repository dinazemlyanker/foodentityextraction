The right cocktail. Embracing mistakes. And having a damn good time. Everything you need to know to have a date night at home that's better than any meal out.By Alex DelanyFebruary 12, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailGentl & HyersFacebookTwitterEmailWhoa. It\u2019s the fifth date. With that person that you, like, really like. You already took them to your favorite dive bar, strolled through an unfamiliar part of town, spent too much money on movie theater snacks, and ate at that cool new restaurant in that neighborhood you can't afford to live in. Which can mean only one thing: It\u2019s time to cook for your potential life partner at home. It\u2019s date night. At your place. Things are about to get real.Don't freak! We got you. Follow these tips for hosting a fun, impressive-but-not-too-impressive date night at home and you're as good as gold. And if this happens to be your 427th date, not your fifth, you should read this too. Because we could all do better, couldn't we? Here's what you need to know.Please, Clean UpNo, I\u2019m not your mom, but yeah, I am asking you to clean up your space. I'm not saying you have to Marie Kondo your whole apartment, but you should wipe down all the surfaces in your bathroom, tidy up wherever you're going to be eating, and maybe even clean your fridge so that when you ask your date to grab that chilled bottle of wine their first thought is \"adult\" and not \"dumpster behind the dining hall.\" And definitely take out the garbage. You know what people are attracted to? Places that don\u2019t smell like garbage.Food First, AlwaysYou should have something out or almost finished when your date arrives. Think about what would make you happier: Hearing someone say, \u201cThere will be something for you to eat in 20 minutes,\u201d or, \u201cHere is a very delicious snack for you to eat right now, and wow, you are super cute. Can\u2019t wait to spend the evening talking, laughing, and exploring all of our common interests.\u201d Yeah, the second one sounds better to me too.Photo by Heidi's Bridge, styling by Molly BazWhat\u2019s That Snack Though?Your first course should involve a little more effort than opening a tub of hummus. Which doesn't mean that you have to make p\u00e2t\u00e9 from scratch, but it should feel like there is some intention behind it. Warm, marinated olives with feta? Perfect. A nicely-arranged but affordable charcuterie plate? Sign me up. Cold, crisp crudit\u00e9s with homemade Greek yogurt dip. Now you're talking! Whatever you serve should be snack-able and easy to eat with your hands, and ideally won't require separate plates or sitting down because you\u2019re about to start cooking.Have a Drink on Deck (If That\u2019s Your Thing)If alcohol is in the cards, have something you know you'll both like to drink ready to go. Chilled bubbly wine is never a bad idea, but mixing a dead-simple cocktail like a negroni or a boulevardier is a strong move as well. And by \"simple\" I mean siiiiiiimple\u2014as in, you should be able to make it without looking at a recipe on your phone. If you do go the cocktail route, keep it to one per person and follow it up with some easy-drinking wine or beer to go along with the meal. Pick something you can talk about, like a tart, bready, barrel-aged saison, a dry, funky Basque cider, or a juicy, gulp-able bottle of Beaujolais (French for berries and sunshine, probably). Just make sure it's low enough alcohol that you don't accidentally get nervous-drunk and that you have another bottle to linger over, just in case.Pump the JamsIt\u2019s nice to have silence during a tennis match or your mad dash to watch all those nominated films before the Oscars. But during date night? No, absolutely not. You should be talking and vibe-ing and cooking alongside perfectly-curated tunes. No jumping up to change the song or asking your date to chose the next track, just a playlist that you can play all the way through. Oh. You need such a playlist? We got you. This should work. Or this. Or this.TeamworkCooking together builds chemistry. It shows that you\u2019re willing to let the other person into your zone, that you can work as a team, and you can both enjoy the benefits. (Kitchen Control Freak is not a cute look, no matter how good you think you are.) Plus, it lifts a little stress from your shoulders. Just make sure that you've got a plan, and that you're calling the shots; this is still your show. Ask your date to chop herbs, mix a vinaigrette, or dress a salad. Then, eight years down the line, you can be like, \u201cOMG, babe, remember that time we made that salad together?\u201d as a way of diffusing the argument you're having about whose family you're spending Thanksgiving with this year.You don't really need all this stuff. Just remember: Fork on the left. Knife, spoon, and glass on the right.\nPhoto courtesy of Image SourceSet the Table (For Real)It doesn\u2019t matter what kind of table you\u2019re setting: Whether it\u2019s the kitchen counter, the coffee table, or the ping pong table your roommate convinced you was a suitable replacement for your kitchen table, it should be set properly. Plate, water glass, wine/beer/cocktail glass, napkin, fork, knife, and (maybe) spoon all laid out. (Don\u2019t set the tables with utensils you won\u2019t use, natch.) This is a little thing that shows you\u2019re a human being that cares about stuff from time to time. Psst. The fork goes on the left, and the glass and knife go with the spoon on the right, because the spoon was lonely.When it Comes to Food, Keep it EasyTonight is not the night to make lasagna with homemade noodles. Or learn how to make soup dumplings by hand. The meal you make should be both delicious and attainable, something that you can cook confidently while also carrying on a conversation. A crispy pork chop with a simple endive salad is the archetype\u2014an impressive but manageable cut of meat paired with an \u201cOh, this? I just threw it together. No big deal,\u201d kind of salad. No recreating chef-y dishes or throwing in fancy ingredients just so you can say their names\u2014remember, you're not at a restaurant for a reason.This Isn\u2019t an Eating MarathonSnacks. Main Course. Dessert. You should impress your date with the tasty food (and the ease at which you pulled it off), not a ridiculous quantity. It\u2019s a three-course meal, with an extra seven courses of vibes. Whatever you serve should leave you feeling good for...whatever you get into after dinner. Like, you know...bowling. Or whatever.Dessert Should be Simple and IndulgentBut not before dessert. This is a wide field. I understand, but it gets significantly more narrow when I tell you that dessert should be both warm and quickly assembled. A chocolate Dutch baby is perfect, as is a fruit cobbler or some berry bars with ice cream. Hell, you could even pull some of that defrosted pinwheel cookie dough you have in the fridge, slice a dozen up, and throw them in the oven. Whatever you serve, make sure it inspires something along the lines of, \u201cOhhh. Wow. I am feeling all kinds of emotions.\u201dEmbrace Your MistakesIt\u2019s fine. You\u2019re fine. Nobody's perfect, not even me, the person writing this article, telling you what to do. I\u2019ve messed up dinner plenty of times, and it\u2019s always ended better when I just rolled with it instead of stressing. You're not on a cooking reality show right now\u2014you're having fun. And being the kind of person who flies into a rage or over-apologizes when something doesn't go exactly how you planned isn't exactly the look you're going for, is it? If you drop those perfectly-cooked pork chops on the floor right before dinner, you can always order pizza.Remember What\u2019s Really ImportantAt the end of the day, this date isn\u2019t about the food. It's about warmly welcoming someone into your home and cooking dinner for them. It\u2019s about the fact that you liked them enough to do that. That person isn\u2019t at your place because they\u2019re expecting the best meal of their life; they're there because they like you. The meal, the music, and the little extra efforts only add to your already extraordinary appeal.Looking for some menu inspo?
