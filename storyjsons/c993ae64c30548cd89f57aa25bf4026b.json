However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\u201cEating is a communal activity,\u201d says Brian Baumgartner, who played earnest doof Kevin Malone on the genre-redefining sitcom The Office. \u201cAnd we needed to find ways to get these characters to interact, right?\u201d Baumgartner, sunlit in his Zoom rectangle, is recalling all the ways food was eaten, thrown, spilt, and Jell-O\u2013fied throughout the show\u2019s eight-year run. \u201cWhether it be in the break room, by the vending machines, or [at] some sort of party,\u201d he continues, \u201cI think our show probably leaned into [food] more than most.\u201dLast year The Office was the most-streamed TV show across platforms. (I can personally account for a good chunk of the 57 billion minutes Americans spent LOL-ing our way through all nine seasons.) Since the U.S. adaptation of the British original debuted in 2005, The Office has become a cultural icon, delivering us memes, punchlines, and now an oral history in book form: Welcome to Dunder Mifflin. Coauthored by Baumgartner and the show\u2019s producer Ben Silverman, it draws from hundreds of hours of interviews with the cast and creators, painting a behind-the-scenes, nostalgic, and absurdist picture of a series that\u2014spoiler alert!\u2014barely survived its first season. According to me, any Office stan worth their salt needs a copy. \u201cLet me just tell you this,\u201d Baumgartner says, levitating the book into view. \u201cIt is thick and it is significant. And I think it's beautifully done.\u201dWelcome to Dunder Mifflin: The Ultimate Oral History of The Office$30 $20 at AmazonOff screen Brian Baumgartner is kind, funny, and optimistic. While you wait for your copy of the book to arrive, here\u2019s his review of The Office\u2019s most iconic food scenes, starting, of course, with Kevin\u2019s famous chili.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.1. Kevin spills his famous chili (season 5, episode 26)On a Casual Friday, Kevin Malone brings in a huge silver pot of his famous chili, the thing he says he does best. After struggling up the stairs (the elevator is, of course, out of order), Kevin drops the pot and gallons of chili spill all over the Dunder Mifflin carpet\u2014and himself. \u201cPeople come up to me and they just focus on the comedy of [the scene],\u201d Baumgartner says. \u201cI think they\u2019re psychopaths. Because you have to feel bad for the guy, right?\u201d It\u2019s true. One of the things that makes Kevin such a lovable character is witnessing how much joy he gets out of incredibly small victories. \u201cSo making this the thing that Kevin is most proud of, and then having it fail, makes it funny,\u201d says Baumgartner. \u201cBut there is also a tremendous amount of heart behind it.\u201dThe scene itself was a total mess to make. \u201cI was told [by our prop master], \u2018We have three pieces of carpet. That\u2019s it, man. So don\u2019t screw this up,\u2019\u201d says Baumgartner, who luckily nailed the shot in one take. While there was a lot of thought paid to cleaning up the set, \u201cnot as much [was paid] to the cleaning up of me,\u201d he laughs. \u201cIt wasn't like, \u2018Oh, just put on another suit.\u2019 No, it was bad.\u201d Despite smelling of garlic and tomatoes well after shooting, Baumgartner still enjoys making and eating chili. His secret? \u201cWell, you know the trick is to undercook the onions.\u201dContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.2. Todd Packer drugs the office with cupcakes (season 9, episode 17)Todd Packer (David Koechner) arrives at Dunder Mifflin carrying cupcakes laced with a variety of drugs\u2014some legal, some not. Everyone suffers rough (and disturbing) aftermaths, except Kevin and Andy (Ed Helms), who frolic around the office all night arm wrestling, hugging, and swapping outfits like two gals on a sleepover. \u201cEd Helms and I went to high school together,\u201d Baumgartner says. \u201cSo that was really fun to play together. I don\u2019t remember exactly what was improvised, but we would get into it and just start thinking of things. I still remember sitting cross-legged on the table, massaging each other\u2019s faces and putting on each other\u2019s clothes.\u201dThe colorful cupcakes deployed throughout the episode are elegantly frosted and adorned with shredded coconut and mini Oreos\u2014kind of like the designer cupcakes you might find at a Baked by Melissa. At the time \u201cthat was the fancy thing that you would give to your workplace,\u201d Baumgartner says. \u201cI feel like now we've moved to doughnuts, right?\u201dContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.3. Michael forces Kevin to eat broccoli (season 7, episode 13)Sweet Kevin\u2019s New Year\u2019s resolution is to eat more vegetables, so in front of the entire staff Michael (Steve Carell) forces him to eat raw broccoli, literally shoving the crown into his mouth while screaming, \u201cEat it!\u201d The whole thing is a corporate lawsuit waiting to happen, and kinda hard to watch. \u201cIn terms of the embarrassment, being forced into doing something because of Michael\u2019s pure will, that he doesn\u2019t want to do at that moment, was really not good [for Kevin],\u201d Baumgartner says.It wasn\u2019t great for Baumgartner either, who loves \u201cwell-cooked\u201d broccoli. \u201cI don't like eating it raw,\u201d he confirms, shuddering at the multiple takes he had to do. \u201cThey put [them] in crudit\u00e9s all the time. Everybody eats the carrots, the celery, and maybe a few tomato balls\u2014but nobody ever eats the broccoli or cauliflower.\u201dContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.4. Jim puts Dwight\u2019s stapler in Jell-O (season 1, episode 1)You know this Jim (John Krasinski) and Dwight (Rainn Wilson) spoof. Michael is introducing a new hire to the office when Dwight opens his desk drawer to find his black stapler suspended in an ornate mound of puke-colored jelly. Yes, Dwight is being bullied by his literal boss and that is bad. But I challenge you to watch this bit and not root for Jim and Michael. The scene, which sets up eight years of horseplay between the two office pranksters, is also a feat of food engineering. \u201cI know there were multiple Jell-O\u2019s made,\u201d Baumgartner says. \u201cI remember, even then, it was difficult to get the stapler to suspend. For years now, via social media or other picture-sharing apps, it's been attempted many times. And mostly abject failure occurs because the stapler always sinks.\u201dContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.5. Michael demands A MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP ICE CREAM CAKE (season 1, Episode 4)A month before Meredith\u2019s actual birthday, Michael tries to boost morale by throwing her an office party. Despite her dairy allergy, Michael demands the planning committee serve a mint chocolate chip ice cream cake from Baskin-Robbins. \u201cI can't eat generic mint chocolate chip ice cream to this day because of how much was consumed over the five days of shooting that scene,\u201d Baumgartner says. \u201cEvery time the camera whipped around, we were all\u2014especially Kevin and Michael, who\u2019d made a big deal about it and had to enjoy it\u2014supposed to be eating this really, really, really green mint chocolate chip ice cream. Now I know: The greener it is, probably the less good it is.\u201dContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.6. Nobody\u2019s allowed to join the \u201cFiner Things Club\u201d (season 4, Episode 10)Oscar (Oscar Nunez), Toby (Paul Lieberstein), and Pam are founding members of the \u201cFiner Things Club,\u201d an exclusive group that meets monthly in the break room to discuss art and culture over very extra lunches. As they\u2019re chatting, Kevin comes in and fights with the vending machine, interrupting the conversation while procuring a bag of what appears to be Doritos. \u201cThe tower of finger sandwiches was, I don't know, very funny to me,\u201d Baumgartner chuckles. But the moment also gestured at class issues in the workplace, he adds, giving a chance \u201cfor Pam, Toby, and Oscar to demonstrate a higher status\u201d\u2014or their aspirations for one, at least.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.7. Cheese puffs derail (not very) serious business (season 5, episode 24)In a montage of satisfying crunches, Michael, Pam, and Ryan (B.J. Novak) lob each other cheese puffs to catch in their mouths at an otherwise Very Important Business Meeting. If ASMR existed in the mainstream back in 2009, this scene would make for a perfect track. \u201cThere was that gigantic container of cheese balls that sat on top of this rolling cabinet thing that was by the bathrooms\u2014I don\u2019t know, forever,\u201d says Baumgartner. \u201cAnd I think somebody from the writers\u2019 room was like, \u2018Yeah, we should use that in some way.\u2019\u201d He found something \u201cpleasurable and nostalgic\u201d about the whole tossing-cheese-puffs-at-people\u2019s-faces thing. Which is exactly what you might say about falling back down an Office rabbit hole.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCulturePop CultureRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
