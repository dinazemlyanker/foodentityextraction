CHRISTIAN, YTC STUDIOSFacebookTwitterEmailWith Cinco de Mayo just around the corner, it\u2019s hard not to feel a little stir-crazy reminiscing about tacos and margaritas past. But there\u2019s no reason to despair when you can bring the fiesta to your own home kitchens.There\u2019s no better way to recreate the feeling of Cinco de Mayo at home than with The Original Margarita recipe. The Original Margarita was created by Dallas socialite Margarita Sames who mixed her two favorite spirits - Cointreau and tequila - together with lime juice while vacationing in Acapulco back in 1948. Crafted from a blend of all-natural sweet and bitter orange peels, Cointreau is beloved worldwide for its highly aromatic and perfectly balanced orange flavor. It is essential for any home bar.The premium orange liqueur is highly versatile and can be mixed with essentially any spirit to make a more elevated cocktail. In the first video below, Bon App\u00e9tit's Carla Lalli Music and Rick Martinez get together over Zoom to prep for Cinco de Mayo. Carla crafts The Original Margarita - Cointreau, tequila, and lime juice - and Rick puts his riff on the original recipe, the Mora Picosa. This spicy blackberry riff gets its kick from the chile de \u00e1rbol. In the following video, Molly Baz makes The Original Maragarita straight from her own kitchen on Cinco de Mayo.Scroll down for The Original Margarita recipe and more twists on The Margarita from Bon App\u00e9tit chefs, including Carla's recipe for a Salt and Smoke Margarita - punchy with olives and mezcal - and Alex Delany's recipe for a Full-Citrus Marg, which gets its citrusy flavor from Cointreau (orange), lime, and grapefruit. Rick shares his recipe for the Mora Picosa. Molly then joins the party with a Spicy Celery Marg, which uses the leafy vegetable for a refreshing take on the classic.The Original MargaritaRecipe by: CointreauThe Original Margarita,\nPaul H.
