Us too. We\u2019re not talking about the fluorescent, sugary-sweet kind your parents may have said cheers to back in the day; these latest versions incorporate locally-sourced spirits and exotic, tropical ingredients, unlike any libation you\u2019ve had before. Before you head on your next island-hopping adventure (hello, Princess Cruises!) we\u2019re sharing our favorite drinks from Antigua to Cozumel and Cura\u00e7ao\u2014so you know what to order and where to get it while in town.Cura\u00e7ao\u2014Take a Sip with Sophisticated StyleCura\u00e7ao is not just the blue colored spirit you\u2019ve seen on cocktail menus. It\u2019s also the name of the Dutch Caribbean island, known for its beautiful cove-tucked beaches and expansive coral reefs. While Blue Cura\u00e7ao\u2014the original recipe using the bitter peels of laraha citrus fruit\u2014is still popular in a variety of cocktails, the non-colored orange version is a great way to bring the vibrant citrus flavor liqueur to your drinks. Try something a little different with an Orange Box Car. This sophisticated spin on a fruit-forward cocktail is made with Senior Genuine Orange Liqueur, gin, egg white, lemon juice, orange-infused simple syrup, and fresh orange. When you\u2019re docked and looking to explore the island for a unique twist on island cocktails, don\u2019t miss Luke\u2019s Cocktail Bar\u2014a small, intimate bar with a distinctive menu.Cozumel\u2014Cheers! You Had Us at Mezcal and CucumberYes, making a trip to Cozumel could surely lead you on the tequila train but one of our favorite spirits of the moment is mezcal. In Mexico, both tequila and mezcal are in high demand for all kinds of beachy cocktails. The island off Mexico's Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula is famous for its renowned snorkeling and diving. When your activities are done for the day, it\u2019s the perfect time to relax with a drink that\u2019s refreshing and has a slight kick. The Mezcal Con Pepino gets a smoky start from mezcal mixed with fresh lime juice, agave nectar, muddled cucumber, serrano pepper, and a sweet-tart combo of crushed chili pequin and sugar on the rim. For a spot in town that feels a little off the tourist path, pay a visit to Turquoise Beach Club for a local libation at happy hour.Antigua\u2014There\u2019s Nothing Better Than Your SmileSurrounded by coral reefs, the stunning island of Antigua is known for its many sandy beaches and also, for its very own rum. Though Old Fashioned Rum Punch recipes are ever present, it\u2019s the namesake Antigua Smile we\u2019re crushing on. This golden-hued cocktail just screams summer, and with a combo of Cavalier Antigua Rum, Creme de Banana, and a unique variety of pineapple called Antigua Black\u2014it hits all the perfect \u201cI\u2019m never leaving this spot on the beach\u201d vibes. If you\u2019re on the island and want to try this mouthwatering drink while admiring the view, make a stop at Castaways Beach Club and say cheers to the sunset.Baby, Let\u2019s Cruise for a Delicious Spin on Traditional CocktailsOnce you have a taste for delicious, island-inspired cocktails made with fresh fruit ingredients, we can\u2019t blame you for wanting to make the most of every opportunity to grab one. Right onboard your next Princess Cruise through the breathtaking Caribbean islands, tap your friendly bartender to shake up one of these signatures for you to enjoy. The Ultimate Mai Tai is made with Bacardi Oakheart Rum, Amaretto, pineapple and orange juices, a splash of sweet and sour, and Grenadine. Or if a Pineapple Mojito is more your style, try their delicious signature version that\u2019s made with Bacardi Pineapple instead of the usual white rum.
