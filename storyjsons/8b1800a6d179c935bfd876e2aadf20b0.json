This lends heat, sweetness, and crunch to these tender coconut-braised carrots. And it lasts for a few days, so I dust it on everything: soups, stir-fries, oats.\u201d Look for big, meaty carrots, which char nicely and won\u2019t fall apart as they slowly braise in the spicy coconut milk mixture.Ingredients4 servings3Tbsp. virgin coconut oil or vegetable oil1\u00bdlb. large carrots (about 6), scrubbed, sliced on a deep diagonal into 5\"-long pieces1lemongrass stalk, tough outer layers removed, trimmed, finely chopped4garlic cloves, finely chopped1small red chile, finely chopped, or \u00bd tsp. crushed red pepper flakes11\" piece ginger, peeled, finely chopped113.5-oz. can unsweetened coconut milk2tsp. fish sauce (optional)Kosher salt\u2153cup unsweetened coconut flakes1tsp. coriander seeds1tsp. toasted sesame seeds\u00bdcup mint leaves, torn if largePreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 400\u00b0. Heat oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high. Cook carrots, turning once, until golden brown in spots but still very firm and crunchy, about 6 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer carrots to a plate. Reserve pan with oil.Step 2Mash lemongrass, garlic, chile, and ginger to a coarse paste with a mortar and pestle. (Alternatively, you can chop very finely with a chef\u2019s knife.)Step 3Set reserved skillet over medium heat; add paste. Cook, stirring often, until paste starts to soften and is golden, about 3 minutes. Pour in coconut milk and fish sauce (if using). Season with salt; bring to a simmer. Remove from heat, add carrots, and bake in oven until carrots are tender and sauce is thickened, 25\u201330 minutes.Step 4Meanwhile, toast coconut flakes in a dry small skillet over medium heat, shaking pan occasionally, until golden, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl; wipe out skillet.Step 5Toast coriander seeds in same skillet over medium heat, shaking pan often, until slightly darkened and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Transfer to mortar and pestle and let cool, then coarsely grind (or lightly with flat side of chef\u2019s knife). Add coriander and sesame seeds to coconut flakes; season lightly with salt. Crush coconut flakes with your hands until almost uniform in size with seeds.Step 6Transfer carrots to a platter and top with mint and some coconut dukkah. Reserve extra dukkah for another use.Do ahead: Coconut dukkah can be made 3 days ahead.
