His and more than 175 other businesses were left without a space to prepare their products. As Springer regroups, and puts a pause on sauce production, he's launched a crowdfunding campaign to help fund his move to a new kitchen. You can learn more, and contribute here.When Andre Springer made his first batch of hot sauce six years ago, there was some confusion. Springer, dressed as his drag alter-ego Shaquanda Coco Mulatta, was at Bushwig, Brooklyn\u2019s annual drag festival. Beaming, curly hair tied up in a colorful bandana, nails painted cherry red, gold hoop earrings swinging, Shaquanda rolled a shopping cart full of sauce through the festival. \u201cA lot of people there were asking me when I would perform,\u201d Springer remembers, giggling. \u201cI was like, \u2018Right now. Open your hand, here\u2019s a cracker.\u2019 And I put some hot sauce on it.\u201d And just like that, Shaquanda\u2019s Hot Pepper Sauce was born.Springer, now 36, began working at a gay bar in his early twenties, where he became friends with the resident drag queen. One night, when she was hosting her weekly Jeopardy game, she \u201casked me if I wanted to do drag,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Oh my god yes.\u2019\u201d Shaquanda was his first character. With her bandana and her apron, she was an homage to Springer\u2019s grandmother, a cook in Barbados before she moved to New York.Since then, Shaquanda has been a fixture in Brooklyn\u2019s drag scene. She doesn\u2019t perform on stage. Instead, she interacts with her audiences, dancing through the crowd, and pulling partygoers onto podiums to dance and sing with her. Springer first had the idea to add hot sauce to Shaquanda\u2019s performance after a trip to Barbados six years ago. Wherever he went, he was greeted by some version of the peppery sauce, which his grandmother in New York poured over all of her food. He came back to New York with a plan to make his own sauce, one that would act as a unique expression of his identity as a queer Barbadian New Yorker.A fiery jar of Shaquanda's Hot Pepper Sauce.\nPhoto by Chelsea KyleHe proudly describes the resulting sauce\u2014a fiery mixture of vinegar, onions, and fresh peppers\u2014as \u201ca drag sauce.\u201d Each bottle, wrapped in a bright red label, is emblazoned with Shaquanda\u2019s face and a variety of sassy slogans: \u201cBe the queen of your kitchen\u201d and \u201cWilling to please, eager to burn.\u201d\u201cThat imagery is me,\u201d he says, picking up one of the bottles from the coffee table in his Bed-Stuy apartment. \u201cIt\u2019s my face; it\u2019s my history; it\u2019s my culture. It\u2019s who I am.\u201d Each bottle is a way for Springer to share his Barbadian roots and bring his drag performance into spaces that often lack queer visibility. \u201cFor me, that is a performance in and of itself.\u201dSince Springer first peddled hot sauce at Bushwig six years ago, his business has grown. Now, he makes roughly 200 bottles of sauce a week in a Brooklyn commercial kitchen and distributes it to small shops in Bushwick and several in Manhattan. Making hundreds of bottles of sauce is a labor of love, but when Springer sells a bottle to a queer kid, or meets a woman named Shaquanda at the farmers' market while he\u2019s vending (it\u2019s happened), it all seems worth it. \u201cI'm a one-queen shop, and it's hard doing all of these things,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I want to see more queer visibility on the shelf. There's so much you can do with advertising and packaging that can teach people to love each other and be accepting.\u201dSometimes Springer looks in a shop\u2019s window and, caught off guard, sees Shaquanda smiling back at him on a hot sauce bottle. In those moments, all of Springer\u2019s work feels worth it. \u201cHey girl,\u201d he\u2019ll say through the window, blowing Shaquanda a kiss. \u201cWho you goin' home with today?\u201dGet on the waiting list for Shaquanda's Hot Pepper Sauce here.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHot SauceCondiment/SpreadNew YorkprofileRead MoreLifestyleGangstas to Growers Is Changing the World, One Tasty Bottle of Hot Sauce at a TimeBy Hilary CadiganRecipes you want to make.
