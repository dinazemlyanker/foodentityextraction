It isn\u2019t the swan that a burly, mustachioed server would ceremoniously craft out of aluminum foil and my fettuccine Alfredo leftovers when I was a kid. It isn\u2019t even the pound of mozzarella that smothers a breaded and fried chicken cutlet the size of my face. No, my favorite part has to be the bottle of booze casually plopped on the table post-meal.In my book, every good red-sauce feast ends with a few glasses of sambuca, grappa, amaro, or, best of all, limoncello\u2014that Gatorade yellow, sometimes cloyingly sweet Italian liqueur made with just citrus, sugar, vodka, and water. And it doesn\u2019t even have to be great\u2014it just has to be free, and delivered with a wink and a smile by some gruff owner who I thought didn\u2019t like me. Even better if the booze comes in an unmarked bottle of questionable origin, perhaps made by a distant relative named Giovanni or Sofia just outside Florence and smuggled back in a suitcase.At my favorite modern Italian-American joint, Frankies 457 Spuntino in Brooklyn, owners Frank Falcinelli and Frank Castronovo used to make their own brew out of Meyer lemons and the gnarled peel of Buddha\u2019s hand. If I was lucky, one of the Franks would bring out a frosty reused wine bottle filled with the house-made stuff\u2014just sweet enough with a smack of acidity, like chewing a handful of Lemonheads\u2014and keep pouring until all the little troubles of the week faded away. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s not so much about what it tastes like. It\u2019s about an oddball time-honored tradition that will, on my table, never go out of style.Andrew Knowlton is the editor at large of Bon App\u00e9tit.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsItalian AmericanRed SauceBrooklynRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
