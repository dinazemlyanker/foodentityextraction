My fridge was full of pre-portioned ingredient packages, and I longed for literally anything else to eat after that very long month. But there was one meal that I kept making for months and years afterward: banh mi turkey burgers. Martha Stewart\u2019s recipe (from the Martha & Marley Spoon box) was straightforward, flavorful, and the only reason I would ever buy ground turkey. They had all the flavors of a Vietnamese banh mi sandwich in burger form, using fish sauce, scallions, garlic, Sriracha, cornstarch to bind, and a tiny bit sugar for balance. Quick-pickled vegetables, cilantro, and Sriracha mayonnaise went on top and pulled the whole thing together. The patties were juicy and springy and and so flavorful\u2014it was a transformative turkey experience.Then, while moving apartments, I lost the XL recipe card and Googled the recipe one day. Instead of Martha\u2019s recipe, I found a 2010 Bon App\u00e9tit recipe for pork meatball banh mi sandwiches. They were made with ground pork instead of turkey, but had a lot of the same ingredients, so I gave the recipe a try, swapping ground turkey for the pork. I used an ice cream scoop to portion out meatball sizes, rolled them out, and then gently pressed them into little slider patties. Whenever I cook meatballs on the stovetop, they don't brown evenly and roll around. Usually I opt to oven-roast them, but I was in a hurry and knew that sliders would cook through quickly.Quick pickled vegetables + banh meatballs = my favorite meal.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Susie TheodorouAfter cooking about four minutes per side, they were done, and just as juicy and flavorful as I remembered. I plopped three of them on top of a bowl of rice, drizzled on some spicy mayo, and topped it all with cilantro, scallions, and quick-pickled carrots (those pre-shredded carrots from the store soaked in rice vinegar, salt, and sugar). Bingo, bongo\u2014a rice bowl for dinner, and easy to portion out for meals for the week. It was accidental meal prep the first time, but they reheated so well and were so satisfying that I do it at least once a month. I know the recipe by heart now, and even though I know they'd taste damn good if I used pork, I always use turkey out of habit.I try to meal prep at least once or twice a week, but often get sick of what I make after a day or two. Not these! I can eat them three days in a row, and then am a little disappointed the next day when they\u2019re gone. They are pretty healthyish\u2014even more so if I serve them over greens instead of rice\u2014and cook in 30 minutes or less, so they're super weeknight-friendly. The BA recipe calls for pickled daikon and jalape\u00f1os, but I sweat when I eat spicy things and I can\u2019t always find daikon, so I just use whatever fresh, crunchy things I have lying around. The toppings can be whatever you want, honestly. Once I forgot to pickle veg, so I got some raw scallions and carrots from the cafeteria to top my bowl. It did not suck.When I microwave these bad boys at the office, somebody will shout out, without fail: \u201cWhat smells so good?\u201d I say \u201cbanh meatballs,\u201d even though that\u2019s technically not true since they\u2019re flat, but I can\u2019t resist a pun. Or a turkey slider. Sometimes I don\u2019t mind being totally predictable\u2014for three days a week, at least.Get the recipe:Pork Meatball Banh MiView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBanh MiMeatballTurkeyBasicallyNever FailRead MorecookingThis Chicken Meatball Recipe Makes Me Feel Like a Meal Prep QueenBy Emily SchultzcookingI Love This Lamb Meatball Recipe So MuchBy Andy BaraghanicookingThese Vegetarian Meatballs Are Our Spring Weeknight ObsessionBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
