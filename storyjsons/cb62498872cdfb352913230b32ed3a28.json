Make them for your end-of-summer barbecue, but be sure to provide plenty of napkins (and maybe a plate of crunchy, bright vegetables for some refreshment). St. Louis-style pork ribs are flatter and fattier (not to the mention less expensive) than baby back ribs, which means that they'll brown more easily. The weight of a rack of can vary greatly, so you'll need to adjust the salt accordingly: As a general rule of thumb, use 1 tsp. salt for 1 lb. meat (our recipe calls for 2 Tbsp.\u2014a.k.a. 6 tsp. salt\u2014because it's based on two 3 lb. racks).All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

The only deviation is that I've added about a tablespoon+ of sriracha sauce to the sauce recipe and have cut back the water to about a 1/4 of a cup+. Also take that silk skin off the back of the ribs!! It's a lot of work  but well worth it! This is definitely a fan favorite of la familia and will keep it in the playbook forever! Next step is to smoke them first to add that extra Umami level.Bro-LandoPflugerville, Texas8/15/2021Excellent ribs-agree too much salt.  I put 1 tsp instead of a tablespoon in the dry mix. I also added an orange peel to the sauce and discarded afterwards. Excellent!  My new go to recipeJennyfrumdablokNew Zealand6/4/2021A healthy dollup of doenjang paste in the bbq saucemakes this taste like Chinese sausage. Super tasty!JackIndianapolis3/8/2021I read they were a bit salty, but they were uneatable.  Jim EngelMPLS MN2/7/2021I followed the recipe exactly.  If I cooked this again, I would use low-sodium soy sauce, or use half the recommended amount in the glaze.  Even my salt-loving husband found this too salty. AmandaSanDiegoSan Diego, CA1/30/2021Go-to dinner for guests. I\u2019m obsessed. I don\u2019t alter the recipe at all because I\u2019m not a lunatic. It\u2019s fantastic. People are always impressed. I\u2019m impressed. You should be impressed. \nThis introduced me to Chinese 5 spice and my life is so much better I\u2019m never disappointed with BA recipes. \nThrow some green onions and sesame seeds on top for flare and excitement - you can\u2019t go wrong.  Molly always on point. Alyssa VPinedale, WY1/11/2021This sauce is SO GOOD. I made BA\u2019s hoisin to use for this recipe, which is good on its own, but with the extra spices it was even better. I used bone-in pork chop because I already had it in the freezer and this recipe worked great- just had to adjust the cooking times a little. Broiling the sauce on top really put this over the top, and I served it garnished with green onions. Will definitely make again!Detroit, MI9/29/2020How many minutes if to cook if I put the ribs in the oven? Thanks AnonymousHong Kong5/21/2020Besides my own issue going a bit heavy on the five-spice, these are easy, delicious, and make a great dinner. This is one of those recipes I'll be dreaming about in a week or two. Very memorable.AnonymousSquamish4/7/2020Ribs were super great. The sauce was delicious and way more unique than any store bought BBQ, although the sauce was quite salty. I would suggest using low-sodium soy sauce and then adding salt later so you have a little more control, I ended up thinning the sauce out with some onion, honey, and butter due to the salt.AnonymousNew York City3/31/2020These ribs are a w e s o m e . Steaming inside the tin foil produces beautifully tender ribs, and the glaze was delicious. Only thing I'd add is season the ribs a couple hours before cooking. And that you should shoot for ~190 F internal if you want your ribs to have any chew to them. 22ozBoneInRibeyeSteakJersey1/26/2020Ribs were tender but flavors were not good. It sounded good that I made 3 racks o we would have lots of leftovers. Had to get really creative to make the leftovers  palatable. Glad I didn't have guests. khenninAlbuquerque12/9/2019Totally didn\u2019t use the methodology (I did them in the slow cooker to start and then finished then under the broiler), but shout out to the sauce: the real MVP here.kaesha10/4/2019Five spice is pretty intense so I used half in the rub and skipped it in the glaze. I only used about 1/2 cup water on the sheet tray. These turned out great. Definitely gonna make again. TX9/24/2019LOVED this recipe and it was so, so easy to make (and a super inexpensive dinner party main course)! The ribs came out tender, juicy and bursting with flavor and we actually had enough leftovers to have two more meals (after serving four, initially). We don't own a grill so this was the perfect recipe for us - actually, it's so maintenance I'd rather use the oven than a grill for ribs anyway. It meant I could join the party vs. standing over a hot grill. clarekleinedlerPortland, Oregon9/6/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titRibsPork RibPorkMeatGingerHerbs & SpicesGarlicVegetableMainDairy-FreeNut-FreeBroilSuper BowlFourth Of JulyMemorial DayLabor DayDinnerBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
