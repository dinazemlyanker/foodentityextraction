Swirled with licks of hot pink and cobalt blue icing, they were developed with fierce holiday cookie swaps in mind, but they\u2019d be just as welcome at a Grateful Dead tailgate or a VSCO Girl theme party. \u201cI knew that I wanted colorful cookies that were festive but that didn\u2019t scream Christmas,\u201d Rick told me. Out with the green and red, in with the pink and blue.Rick also knew that he didn\u2019t want to use synthetic food coloring in his cookies. \u201cThe stuff you get at the grocery store does a number on your dough,\u201d he explains. \u201cIf you add a tablespoon of it to a perfectly delicious, moist cake recipe, it\u2019ll come out sad and dry.\u201d The antithesis of the holiday spirit! Plus, what is synthetic food coloring anyway? According to respected scientific journal Wikipedia, the food coloring Blue #1, which is found in everything from Jolly Ranchers to canned processed peas to Blue Cura\u00e7ao, is a \u201csynthetic dye produced by the condensation of 2-formylbenzenesulfonic acid and the appropriate aniline followed by oxidation blah blah blah.\u201d For our favorite recipes using 2-formylbenzenesulfonic acid, click here.Watch Rick go to work on his Tie-dye cookies.\nSo Rick went in search of a natural food coloring alternative. \u201cI certainly wasn\u2019t going to ask anybody to make a natural dye,\u201d he says\u2014although if you are the extra credit type, check out Healthyish\u2019s guide to making your own. He settled on Suncore Foods Supercolor Powders, which come in a wide array of hues, from violet to aqua to yellow. For the Tie-Dye Butter Cookies, Rick used the Pink Pataya (made from 100 percent pure red dragon fruit powder) and Blue Butterfly Pea (made from 100 percent pure butterfly pea flower powder). In addition to having pronounceable ingredients, the natural dyes impressed Rick with their vibrancy and variety. \u201cIf you were using that little four pack of green, blue, yellow, and red,\u201d he says, \u201cyou\u2019d have to do a lot of mixing to get such a specific fuchsia color. Even then it would be tough, and if you had to make several batches, you probably wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve the same color consistently.\u201dForecast for 2020: more tie-dye.\nPhoto by Ted + Chelsea Cavanaugh, food styling by Michelle Gatton, prop styling by Beatrice ChastkaSince the powders are derived from actual foods, they do come with a slight taste, but nothing too conspicuous. \u201cIf you\u2019re using the red powder, you\u2019re not going to take a bite of a cookie and go, \u2018Whoa, beets!\u2019 But it does have a faint flavor, so you know you\u2019re not just eating red powdered sugar and water.\u201d The Pink Pataya powder gives off tropical vibes while the Blue Butterfly Pea is more subtle, with a hint of flavor that Rick describes as \u201cberrylike.\u201d Together, they add a ever so slightly fruity hint to an otherwise classic, vanilla-inflected butter cookie.Rick notes that while the two cookies he developed for the holidays featuring these dyes\u2014the Tie-Dye Butter Cookies and the Alfajores with Coconut Dulce de Leche\u2014use them in raw applications, he has tested them in batters and doughs with equally successful results. While the outside of the cake or cookie will brown as normal, inside you\u2019ll find the same bold color\u2014no 2-formylbenzenesulfonic acid required.Buy it: Suncore Foods Supercolor Powders, from $10 on AmazonAll products featured on bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
