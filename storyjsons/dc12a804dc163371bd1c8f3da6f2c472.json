Trust Us.Baby spinach gets gross when you cook it. Here's what you should do instead.By Alex DelanyJanuary 9, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Laura MurrayFacebookTwitterEmailOnce upon a time, the word \"spinach\" conjured up images of a gloopy, dark green slime that shot out of tin cans and into Popeye's cartoon mouth. It was gross, but good for you. Nowadays, though, we're more likely to think of tender-leaved baby spinach when we think of the vegetable; that stuff is everywhere, a staple of salad bars and crisper drawers everywhere. So it makes sense that, when most people are staring down a recipe that calls for cooked spinach\u2014be it a coconut-infused lentil soup or phyllo-encased spanikopita\u2014they are likely to reach for the plastic tub of the baby stuff in their fridge. But that's a mistake, because cooked baby spinach is, well, slimy and gross. No bueno.We only eat baby spinach raw over here. It gets slippery and weird when thrown into soups, saut\u00e9ed, or stirred into pasta sauce. Does it seem like a convenient way to use up the wilty last few cups leftover from a week of meal prepped salads? Sure. But is it delicious? No. No it isn't. So what to do when we want a cooked dish that has all of those nutrients and green, leafy flavor, sans slime? You've got two options.Frozen spinach is killer in lentil soup.\nPhoto by Heidi's Bridge, styling by Molly BazFirst, there's the Alice Waters-approved method. You buy a few beautiful bunches of dark green, mature spinach\u2014ideally from the farmers' market. You  carefully wash them, blanch them in boiling, salted water, shock them in ice water, and then press them in a sieve or colander to get out any excess liquid before incorporating them into a recipe. It's a lot of work, but totally worth it if you're into that kind of thing.And then there's the, we-just-want-to-get-dinner-on-the-table method: Use frozen spinach. That's right, we said it. Thaw one of those rectangular boxes from the grocery store's frozen food section, give it a quick squeeze, and go to town. Sure, a lot of frozen vegetables deserve all of the shade that gets thrown their way\u2014looking at you, frozen broccoli\u2014but others, like spinach and peas, are a shortcut we can totally get behind. Frozen spinach gives you all the flavor, texture, and nutrition you'd get from fresh mature spinach, but without all of those time-consuming steps. Plus, it's always waiting for you in the freezer, ready at a moment's notice.So yeah, never cook baby spinach. You\u2019re better than that. Raw baby spinach. Meticulously prepped and cooked mature spinach. Or cooked frozen spinach. Those are your options. If you catch us making dinner on a weeknight though, there\u2019s only one real way to go. Hit us with the frozen stuff, every time.Don't just stand there! Thaw some frozen spinach and make this coconut lentil soup:Explore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallySpinachRecipes you want to make.
