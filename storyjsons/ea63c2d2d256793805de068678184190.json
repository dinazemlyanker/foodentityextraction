That glorious occasion is marked by the first corn salad of the season, at least in our book.Our reasoning is simple: Corn salads are a summer classic. The jumble of sweet corn, crisp herbs, and lime-y dressing always feels sunny and bright. But that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re making the exact same recipe on repeat through Labor Day. That would get old. Instead, senior food editor Andy Baraghani developed a flexible, patent-pending formula: 6 ears charred corn + \u00bd cup toasted nuts + 1 cup fresh herbs + 3 oz. crumbly cheese + \u2153 cup fresh citrus juice or vinegar.Start by grilling your corn over medium-high heat until a good amount of char develops, but keep the husks on to keep the kernels protected and moist. Wait a few minutes before shucking so you don\u2019t burn your fingers, then cut the kernels into a big bowl along with your chosen mix-ins. The idea is to riff with whatever you have on hand, whether you\u2019re cooking in a vacation house with a limited pantry or working with a major farmers\u2019 market haul. Just make sure you hit all of these categories:The NutsWe like pistachios, peanuts, and hazelnuts best, but any nut will do. We like them deeply toasted for maximum nutty flavor.The HeatCorn salad needs a bit of heat to play off the sweet and salty. Pack a punch with a thinly sliced serrano chile, or keep it mild with crushed red pepper flakes or black pepper.The CheeseSlightly salty, crumbly cheese like Cotija, Parmesan, or feta holds together without dissolving or getting weird.The HerbsAdd freshness with torn tender-stemmed cilantro, basil, or mint.The AcidLime is a classic choice, but lemons, sour oranges, or even rice vinegar will do the job. Use whatever\u2019s in your fridge, but don\u2019t skip this step. Like a catchy summer bop, a bit of acidity brings sweet summer corn to life.Get the recipe:No-Brainer Corn SaladSweet summer corn begs to be mixed with a splash of acid, a touch of heat, salty cheese, and toasty nuts for texture.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishCornSaladSummer SidesRead MoreLifestyleThis Sweet and Spicy Grilled Squash Goes Out to All the Vegetarians at the BarbecueBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
