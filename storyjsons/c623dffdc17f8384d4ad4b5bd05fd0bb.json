In a tray of brownies, I want the near pudding-like consistency of the middlemost piece. I dive right into the syrupy center of a piping hot fruit cobbler.The exception to the rule, however, is when cheese and pasta come into play. I always go for the almost-crunchy corner of ziti, the crusty piece of breadcrumbs and lacy cheese in baked macaroni, and, of course, the crisp, golden brown edge piece in a tray of lasagna.In this Spicy Skillet Lasagna With Ricotta and Spinach, with its beautifully furled rolled-up noodles, every serving is like a delightful edge piece from a traditional layered lasagna. Instead of baking lasagna sheets flat in a pan, associate food editor Rachel Gurjar opts for rolling the wavy noodles into pinwheels before arranging them in a skillet. After they\u2019re smothered with a spicy homemade tomato sauce (more on that later) and a shower of Parmesan and baked, the ruffled tops of each sheet of pasta get that crave-worthy, crisp, baked-in cheesiness I'm always seeking.Cast Iron Skillet$30 at AmazonLike any great lasagna, it\u2019s a labor of love\u2014but it\u2019s worth the final reveal. It starts with a homemade tomato sauce seasoned with plenty of red pepper flakes as well as a pinch of cumin. As a generally vegetarian-leaning person, I loved skipping the meat in this recipe and rolling up the thin slices of zucchini into each noodle. But if you\u2019re craving something heftier, you could easily add browned ground beef or turkey to the tomato sauce.Apart from the sauce, the next most important component is, arguably, the cheese: Instead of a traditional b\u00e9chamel, this skillet lasagna gets ricotta that\u2019s blitzed in the food processor with Parmesan until it\u2019s whipped and airy. Combine it with a spoonful of grated mozzarella and you get a melty, cheesy center in each roll-up, as well as a perfect cheese pull moment when you dive in with your fork.This recipe is now my unwavering go-to whenever I\u2019m looking for a crowd-pleasing meal that won\u2019t result in any unnecessary squabbles. There are enough edge pieces to go around!Will It Skillet?Spicy Skillet Lasagna With Ricotta and SpinachNo more fighting for those corner slices of lasagna\u2014each serving of this skillet lasagna delivers that coveted mix of crispy and cheesy.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
