No longer can I keep up with my 23-year old sisters when we go out to the club in Philadelphia. They\u2019ll have spent the night downing much vodka and wake up the next morning like nothing even happened. I, now over the hill, no longer bounce back so easy, and in order to recover, I require a breakfast sandwich from Hungry Pigeon.At its core it\u2019s a house-made english muffin with craggly nooks and crannies, a fried egg with lacy edges and a runny yolk, some Lancaster jack cheese that\u2019s sharp enough to perk me up, and a swipe of creamy-tangy dijonnaise. But it doesn\u2019t have to end there: The best part is choosing which extras to add on.People say you get less fun as you get older, but the sweet Country Time pork roll (this is Philly we\u2019re talking about) and hash brown the size of a brick that I\u2019m known to choose disprove that theory. The crunchy, cubic tater is created by taking loads of shredded (local!) kennebec potatoes, dusting them with rice flour and salt, and then baking them on a sheet tray the day before. When your order comes through, they take a square from the tray and freshly deep fry it, making for a super crispy-and-never-soggy potato puck.The whole thing is greasy, salty, messy, and instantly brings me back to life after a long night out. Though on second thought, I think I\u2019ll leave the sweaty clubs to my sisters, because waking up early to get one of these is now my older, wiser version of a good time.Go there: Hungry PigeonExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendPhiladelphiaBreakfastSandwichRecipes you want to make.
