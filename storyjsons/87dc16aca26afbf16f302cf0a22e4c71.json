If it's gray and mealy like mom\u2019s taco meat used to be, you're not really browning your meat. Those are just the facts. Learning how to brown meat the right way will leave you with a crispier, juicier, more interesting protein. Here's how to show that ground beef, pork, or lamb the respect it deserves.We want what's on the left, not the right.\nPhoto by Alex Lau1) Dry the raw meat on paper towels and let it come up to room temperature.
