I have a small Instant Pot and so cut the recipe in half.  The soup came out perfectly with the 20 minute cooking time and use of the immersion blender.  The only change I made was to omit the carrots as I don\u2019t care for them.  I loved the soup and will make it again.SuzsOak Ridge, Tennessee 2/1/2022Delicious, the whole family loved it. I did use about half beef broth because I had some to use up. And followed other suggestions to cook for 42 minutes. I'd up to 45-50 minutes next time, or let the soup natural release for 20 minutes or so. Mine was ultimately pretty thick. This is definitely a keeper! NicolePhiladelphia, PA1/3/2022Made some modifications to this but it came out great - my first time using an instant pot! Based on other reviews I used 6 cups of liquid instead of 8 and pressure cooked for 25 minutes. I noted that many on here thought that 20 minutes was not enough time for the beans to become soft, so I soaked my beans overnight in salted water and bumped up the time by a few minutes. The beans were perfectly soft and pureed easily once the soup was done cooking!\nAnonymous9/1/2021I LOVE this soup. It is a staple dish in our household. Ditto for my daughter and her family and untold number of her friends.\nUsing the recommended 1 chipotle chili and one adobo sauce is PERFECT for our family. It just gives it a slight kick. \nI cook this soup (using dry, rinsed black beans) in my Instant Pot for 42 minutes. Instead of reducing the amount of water, I take half of the quantity to my Vitamix blender and make it into a thick liquid. Return that to the pot, mix it all up - and you would not believe how wonderful this soup is, thick enough but still there are beans and carrots to chew on! Thank you to whoever created this delicacysonjamyeHouston, TX5/27/2020Didn't care for the flavor of this.  I did use less water also as others suggested. I only used two chipotle peppers but it was so hot half the family couldn't eat it.AnonymousOhio4/25/2020I made this on the stove top with soaked but not cooked beans and cooked everything as directed to start but let simmer for about an hour and a half instead. It turned out a bit watery (but still delicious) so I would reduce the water next time to a quart to start and top up as needed while they cook. AnonymousCanada4/12/2020Can anyone help me convert this timing using canned black beans? Anonymous3/22/2020We make this vegetarian by subbing a parm rind for the bacon, using butter to fry the veggies, and adding some smoked paprika upfront to the onions. It's absolutely delicious and freezes well for long term leftovers!AnonymousSeattle3/3/2020Love this recipe!  When pressure cooking dry beans I always soak beans overnight or quick-soak (boil 1 minute and soak 1 hour).  I never add salt until after beans have completely cooked. Florida3/3/2020I found I needed an extra 20 min of pressure cooking before the beans were really tender and even then (and after blending)I found the soup way too thin. I added in a can of black beans at the end to thicken it. I'd use 1/3 less water next time, and 40 min instead of 20. The flavor was nice though! AnonymousLos Angeles12/12/2019Very good soup!  The bacon adds a lot of flavor.  I used just one chili and 1T of the adobo sauce.  The sour cream mellowed it out for my kids.  I will definitely make this again!  AnonymousAlpharetta, GA11/23/2019So yummy, but with the dry black beans it takes WAY longer than the 20 allotted minutes in the instant pot to cook. I would change the direction to \u201ccook at high pressure for 35 minutes\u201d as the beans were still hard and not yet fully softened after 20 and i ended up adding more time. I also reduced the amount of water to 1.5 quarts. AnonymousLos Angeles11/3/2019This is very good and I will certainly make it again. I used a Fissler stovetop pressure cooker for 30 minutes. In my cooker, I think I\u2019ll cut the water or broth down to 6 cups because it looses very little liquid. The seasonings were great and the pickled onions are a must. I added avocado and cilantro to the onions. AnonymousNashville TN9/7/2019I've made this twice now, though I adapted it for a dutch oven, and not an instant pot, cooking the beans in the traditional way. I omitted the bacon both times (cooking for vegan friends), and mashed the beans roughly with a potato masher (no immersion blender). The first time it reduced enough that it was more of a dip, and I ran with that, making nachos with the leftovers all week. I also misread the recipe and used a whole can of chipotles in adobo sauce. Still a very good, smoky spice level. honeybeebutchMinneapolis, MN2/11/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titSoupSoups and StewsBlack BeanBeanVegetableChipotleChileEasyOne-Pot MealsMainNut-FreeInstant PotLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
