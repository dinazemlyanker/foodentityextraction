Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,A couple days ago, Healthyish editorial assistant Aliza Abarbanel and I tried our first-ever \u201ceuphoric\u201d beverage courtesy of Kin Euphorics, a new company promising to bring us \u201cthe future of revelry.\u201d Kin\u2019s first product is called a social tonic, which sounds like your grandma\u2019s word for her before-dinner G&T, but there\u2019s no alcohol in this (very pretty) bottle. Instead Kin is supposed to give you all the nice effects of booze (relaxation, friendliness) and none of the bad (hangovers), thanks to something called \u201cnootropics,\u201d which as far as I can tell are what Bradley Cooper took in Limitless to make him Superman. The drink tasted like grapefruit pith and licorice and made me feel extremely...alert, but I couldn\u2019t tell if that was the noots (can I call them that?) or the, uh, caffeine.Reads of the WeekI loved editing Khushbu Shah\u2019s story on how Indian food and culture got co-opted and turned into a health trend. Like many things in this weird wellness world, one woman is at the root of it\u2014and she seems well aware of her \u00fcber-influencer status.Emily Schildt\u2019s piece on how \u201cglowing\u201d is an anti-feminist trap is a cheery one too: \u201cIf wellness is to 2018 what \u201chaving it all\u201d was to the \u201980s,\u201d she writes, \u201cthen glowing is the modern equivalent of showing up to the potluck with a perfect perm, two well-behaved children, and a croquembouche.\u201d (If you\u2019re wondering where my glow comes from, it\u2019s French fry grease.)Make This StatSpeaking of croquembouche, I think food editor Molly Baz is actually making one for tonight\u2019s BA cookbook club featuring Martha Stewart\u2019s Entertaining. Tune in to the BA Instagram Story to see how it turns out. For the record, I chose to make the carrot loaf for its health (all those carrots) and its -ish (two sticks of butter). Martha calls it a \u201cfirm, slightly dense loaf that is an excellent base for open-face hors d'oeuvres (it doesn\u2019t crumble),\u201d and now I can\u2019t stop wondering what food you\u2019d possibly serve on top of carrot bread.  Martha, if you're reading this, ENLIGHTEN ME!Last night was full of cooking wins and losses. A win was that I made kimchi udon for the first time, and it was as good as everyone says. A loss was that I took off a piece of my thumb with a mandoline while making quick pickles. A win was that my roommate decided to bake chocolate chip cookies. A loss was that our electric beaters gave out partway through. A win was cookie dough.The 5-Star ReviewI drizzle all day, whether it\u2019s honey on my a.m. toast or sesame oil on my lunchtime noodle bowl. So when Laka Living came out with a pretty line of condiments called Drips, I put aside my post-nasal associations and gave them a try. Totally delicious and somehow totally unsweetened, the cookie drip is great on oatmeal or yogurt, and I was tickled to discover that the chocolate pearl drip turns into a magic shell on ice cream thanks to the coconut oil, which hardens when it gets cold. The drips are infused with adaptogens and said to boost stamina and combat stress, but TBH I\u2019d be drizzling either way.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish EditorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletterRead MoreLifestyleThe Soup That Saved Me and an Epic Thanksgiving TartBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
