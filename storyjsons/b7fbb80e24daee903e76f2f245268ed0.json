This recipe is from Melissa Miranda, the chef-owner of Seattle\u2019s Musang, a Filipinx community space and restaurant.Ingredients4 Servings\u00bccup vegetable oil8garlic cloves, finely chopped4cups cooled cooked jasmine riceJohnny\u2019s seasoning salt or kosher saltFreshly ground black pepper (optional)PreparationStep 1Heat oil in a large wok or nonstick skillet over medium-high. Cook garlic, stirring, until golden brown, about 1 minute. Using a spider or slotted spoon, transfer garlic to a small plate. (Or strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a heatproof measuring glass and return oil to wok.)Step 2Break up rice and place in same skillet; season lightly with seasoning salt (or kosher salt and pepper). Cook, tossing occasionally, until rice is warmed through and crispy in spots. (In Tagalog that crispy rice is called tutong; it\u2019s like the crispy part at the bottom of the paella pan.) Add garlic to rice and toss to combine.How would you rate Garlic Fried Rice?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (3)Back to TopTriangleI\u2019ve had this multiple times at Ate Miranda\u2019s Musang restaurant many times and was so excited to see this as I\u2019ve wondered how to make it. \n\nIt was very close and great with some chicken adobo, YUM!! So impressed to see our neighborhoods own Musang dish in Bon Appetit!!BeaconHill Bike DadSeattle, WA1/24/2022Made this rice to go along with the adobo chicken and winter greens, as shown in the March magazine.  Delicious!  What a simple way to amp up plain, boring rice.  I will say that mine never really crisped up, even after about 10 minutes, so I let it be.  All it did was kind of dry out the rice.  Either way, it was great and I'll definitely do again to replace plain rice in the future!LBinTXTexas3/25/2021So good and unfussy. We ate this with tocino (the only thing missing was a fried egg on top), and our lunch conversation was silenced because we were too busy eating.
