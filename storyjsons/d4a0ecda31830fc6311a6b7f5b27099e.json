Think fidget spinners, motorized hover-boards, and pretty much the entire last season of Game of Thrones. Oh, and intricate knife skills.Lucky for me, senior food editor Molly Baz is on the same page. More often than you\u2019d expect, she skips the knife work and handles food (warm or room temp, obviously) by hand. For the uninitiated, tearing up food can sound counterintuitive at best and downright barbaric at worst, but Molly makes a pretty convincing argument.First, it\u2019s a matter of practicality. \u201cBreaking out my knives just makes for more dirty dishes that I\u2019ll have to clean later,\u201d she told me. Those fancy knife skills you\u2019ve studied while binge-watching fifteen episodes of Chopped aren\u2019t actually going to come in handy right now\u2014sorry!Second, ripping your food into good-sized chunks is an easy way to make a straightforward dinner feel like a showstopper. \u201cI tear because I like the irregular edges and the silhouette they create on the plate,\u201d she says. The natural, organic shapes of torn food will garner ooohs and aaahs when you present, say, a platter of beautifully roasted sweet potatoes, radicchio adorned with torn boiled eggs, a spicy cucumber salad, or a citrus garnish with randomly-sized gems of juicy fruit.But tearing is not just for cooked food or produce you\u2019ll be eating raw. Tearing certain ingredients will subtly change the way they cook: Unlike slicing, which results in straight, neat edges, pulling with your hands makes for a greater amount of uneven, textured surface area, conducive to craggy, crispy, charred edges. Next time you\u2019re making croutons or saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, put away your knife and use your hands instead.Okay, I won\u2019t go so far as to say that knives are overrated (I\u2019m not maniacal), but I will say that I\u2019ll be using my chef knife a little less in 2020. And honestly, my fingers have never felt safer.Get the recipe:Sweet Potatoes With Charred Lemons and CrunchiesWith custardy insides and charred exteriors, these sweet potatoes are everything you always wish roasted sweet potatoes could be. A crunchy mixture of toasted nuts and seeds provides pops of texture and spice, and a cooling lemony yogurt sauce cuts through the richness.\u00a0View RecipeRecipes you want to make.
