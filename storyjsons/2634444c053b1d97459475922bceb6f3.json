But is it really? More than two weeks into the season and, here in New York, there are still 40-degree days in my 10-day forecast. Yes, we\u2019ve had a couple gorgeous afternoons where the thermometer rises to 60 and you put on a denim jacket and decide you don\u2019t need to wear tights. But I promise the moment you put your winter coat in storage is the moment when Mother Nature pulls out that one last snowstorm she\u2019s been hiding up her sleeve.At Bon App\u00e9tit, we herald spring\u2019s arrival, developing recipes around the verdant glory of seasonal produce. Our April print issue, which magically arrived on newsstands on the day of the spring equinox, includes wonderful recipes for chicken saltimbocca with crunchy sugar snaps and loads of mint, juicy chicken thighs with leeks and peas. We can\u2019t wait to cook with rhubarb and artichokes and asparagus and watercress. You should make these recipes the moment these ingredients land at your farmers\u2019 market! But you know what\u2019s at my farmers\u2019 market right now? Cold-storage apples, sweet potatoes, and rutabaga. Rutabaga!Yes, the peas will arrive eventually, and there\u2019ll be that week when everyone loses their minds over ramps (do people still get excited about ramps?), but by that point it\u2019s basically Memorial Day, the unofficial start of summer\u2014which really isn\u2019t summer at all, but that\u2019s a rant for another day.Explore Bon App\u00e9titSpringFarmers MarketRecipes you want to make.
