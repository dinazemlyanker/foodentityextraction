Well, using glass meal prep containers is like dressing for the job you want: it makes you look (and feel) more put together than you actually are. While I'm a big proponent for using disposable takeout containers for leftovers, they're far from perfect. You can't always microwave them\u2014especially with the lid on, which can warp and fuse to the base so it's hard to open without burning yourself with steam. They're not made from the most dishwasher safe material. And they tend to crack after a number of uses. So when I'm really trying to motivate myself to meal prep, I use Anchor Hocking's round glass storage containers with colorful lids.The reasons to love glass food storage containers are the same reasons why your mom loves her Pyrex glass dishes: They're durable and safe in the microwave, dishwasher, or oven. My flight attendant roommate uses these (without the lid, of course) in the oven on airplanes to heat up her food, and I've gone from the fridge to my Breville SmartOven (a fancy convection toaster oven that I use constantly) to reheat things like lasagna or chicken thighs that I want to get crispy on top. It works equally well in a microwave to heat up leftover lentil soup and to tote chilled overnight oats to work.Take this zucchini-eggplant bake from the fridge straight to the oven in a glass storage container.\nStill need more convincing? They're easy to clean, stack perfectly in the fridge, and can be easily labeled with masking tape to know what's inside and when it was made. I've dropped one before and it doesn't shatter and spill food all over the floor like plastic containers can do, and they are nearly impossible to stain. (I'm looking at you, tomato soup leftovers!) Buy this cheap kitchen upgrade and (maybe) convince yourself to pack your lunch more than once a week. It's more impactful on your lifestyle than buying a blazer.Buy it: Anchor Hocking Glass Storage Containers, $15.43 for a set of four on JetTomato soup wont stain these containers:Creamy Tomato Soup with Cheese ToastiesDIY kid food is the best food, if you ask us.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titMeal PrepBasicallyShoppingBA RecommendsRead Morecooking5 Meal Prep Resolutions I'll Definitely, Maybe Follow in 2018By Alyse WhitneycookingHow to Make a Week's Worth of Amazing Lunches in 2 HoursBy Chris Moroccocooking5 Meal Prep Upgrades So You Can Have Healthier Lunches All WeekBy Alyse WhitneycookingMeal Prep Ideas to Save Time, Money, and Your SanityBy Alyse WhitneyRecipes you want to make.
