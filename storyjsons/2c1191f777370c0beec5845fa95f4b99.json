I\u2019m lucky to be able to work from home, but the lack of a commute, coworkers, or appointments has completely eroded any sense of routine. I\u2019ve spent weeks stoically ignoring most of the unsolicited advice online about trying to keep your routine intact. (Sorry, but I\u2019m not putting on pants and walking around the block each morning to mimic my commute.) I\u2019d sit down on the couch to check my email and look up four hours later, dazzled with blue light and ravenous\u2014 then grab food and return to the same position for the rest of the day.So no wonder it feels like clocks are melting Salvador Dali-style. It\u2019s time to make a change. While everyone else in my neighborhood seems to have taken up jogging, I\u2019m taking an actual lunch break.In my days of office dwelling, I mainly used lunchtime to run errands or wade through my inbox while eating with my coworkers.  But now that those things are no longer an option, I'm trying a new approach. For my own good, I set an alarm for 1 p.m. (creatively titled \u201clunch\u201d). I also literally called in some reinforcements: my mom, in LA. If you\u2019re not already maxed out on screen-time, you should definitely give FaceTime lunch dates a try.Time zones get in the way of us actually eating lunch \u201ctogether.\u201d Still, it\u2019s a good excuse to connect over a meal, even if I\u2019m eating salad while my mom makes breakfast. I FaceTimed her a few days ago and we talked about the spring produce I\u2019m waiting on in New York (which she\u2019s had in California for weeks), the recipes we\u2019re eyeing for the weekend, and my dad\u2019s nascent-but-thriving sourdough endeavor. It felt familiar at a time when nothing else does.I thought about embracing other lunch-hour activities, like a daily 12 p.m. yoga livestream, but I had trouble sticking to a strict timeline. And, really, I just want to cook myself a hot lunch. Now, I finally have a routine: With Buena Vista Social Club on the speakers, I bloom spices for comforting pots of dal, turn leftover fish into tacos, and griddle way more than my fair share of quesadillas. Cooking has always been meditative for me, but it turns out that taking time out of my workday to turn off my brain and slice some onions is especially potent stuff.I don't always have time to cook a full meal in the middle of the day, but as the days get warmer, I\u2019m going to try eating outside when I can.  There\u2019s a shuttered restaurant on my corner, quietly waiting for the curve to bend, with a few benches in front perfect for perching with a PB&J. Maybe I\u2019ll call my mom and show her the cherry blossoms.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishLunchCoronavirusSelf CareessayRead MoreCoronavirusIt Took a Global Pandemic, But I'm Finally Calling My MomBy Phillip PicardiRecipes you want to make.
