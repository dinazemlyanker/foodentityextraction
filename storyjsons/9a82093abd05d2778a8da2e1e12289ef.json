Direct heat from the oven (or pan), along with a good bit of olive oil, helps them crisp on the outside while remaining chewy and tender within. Roasting them alongside some cherry tomatoes, which burst to create a jammy sauce, means you\u2019ve got dinner in 25 minutes\u2014just add a heap of greens and lots of sharp cheese and you\u2019re good to go. \u2014Sarah JampelThis recipe is part of Short Is Sweet, our collection of summer dishes that deliver a whole lot of deliciousness in 30 minutes or less.Ingredients4 Servings\u00bdlarge red onion, cut into \u00bd\"-thick wedges2large garlic cloves, unpeeled2pints cherry tomatoes117.6-oz. package shelf-stable or refrigerated potato gnocchi4Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more for drizzling1\u00bdtsp.

Followed the advice of other reviewers by keeping the gnocchi on one side of the sheet and the vegetables on the other, and by doubling the dressing. Highly recommend!Jane A3/22/2022Amazing! I separated the gnocchi from the rest when roasting, and added 2tsp of chilli flakes and some minced black truffle to the (doubled) dressing. Amazing. Jamie PCalgary 3/11/2022This dish is delicious and so simple. I followed the advice of other reviews and roasted the gnocchi on a separate pan and doubled the dressing. I also added zucchini and used a combination of cherry tomatoes and wedges of a variety of larger tomatoes. Sometimes I will swap the basil out for dill and swap the parmesan for feta. It's always delicious. EmilieBrooklyn, NY1/21/2022This is so easy and delicious. I add Italian sausage to make it a little more filling. Love how the tomatoes form a sauce for it all once they burst. AnonymousFort Worth, TX1/2/2022I seperated the gnocchi from the tomatoes as well. Gnocchi got very crispy. Very easy, very delicious!! Dressing was lovely as wellWammie2211Belgium12/9/2021I made this using the suggestion to separate the gnocchi and the vegetables on the baking sheet. Literally just put the gnocchi on one side and everything else on the other, then poured oil and salt on each side separately. It was delicious! The gnocchi got crisp and the tomatoes and onions got soft and delicious.JoanNew York, NY11/8/2021I agree with many others: the gnocchis don\u2019t crisp with all the tomato juices. The dish was still good but more like boiled gnocchi. I will try pan-frying the gnocchi while roasting the onions and tomatoes. StevePalo Alto9/19/2021Amazing! So easy!!! My family loves this, even my 3 small children, and it is incredibly easy to make. My new Friday go-to recipe. The hardest part is finding the roasted garlic cloves amongst the sheet of gnocchi \ud83d\ude48MeghanAustin, TX9/17/2021I have served this recipe to vegetarians and meat-eaters alike! \nThe first time I made this wonderful dish it was delicious, however, I like my gnocchi crisp and golden so I pan-fried them separately in a bit of olive oil and a tiny bit of butter and added them back in just before serving, perfect!!  \n\nI have made this recipe numerous times as the main dish as well as a complementary side dish.\nAs my husband likes meat of some type with every meal, I have added slices of both hot and mild sausage Debra S.Born in the North but live in the South9/13/2021I'm not opposed to vague instructions, but I'm not sure how to interpret a \"wedge\" of onion- is this a thick slice, or like a quarter? Should the root still be on?Katie M.Philadelphia9/7/2021I agree with the comments that roasting the gnocchi separately (even on the same sheet pan), or pan frying, is a more foolproof method. \n\nBut to \"anonymous\" in Rome who is outraged at this treatment because it doesn't exist in Italy: do you only eat foods that are prepared exactly the way the Italians do? Is it illegal to do otherwise? Are there dire consequences if, say, you eat a meatball sub? Please advise ASAP.Linda RSF Bay Area9/3/2021To everyone that made this and the gnocchi wasn't crispy.\n\nNot sure if this was left out intentionally but I always turn the broiler on and let it sit under it for 5 minutes (or more, keep and eye on it) and that will reduce juices and give the gnocchi a nice golden crispy brown.Ryan K.California8/30/2021This is fine. But the reviews below are all true - no way will the gnocchi crisp up in an oven mixed with a bag of  tomatoes in 25 minutes! Just roast the tomatoes, onions and garlic as the recipe but pan-fry the gnocchi separately to get it crispy, then Combine at the end. Easy!Anonymous8/26/2021This was tasty, but my tomatoes produced way too much juice too soon. I\u2019ll try again but roast the gnocchi and onions in one pan, and the tomatoes in another.Anonymous8/26/2021This really didn't work for me. My gnocchi didn't turn remotely golden or crisp at all, but my tomatoes were getting so burst the juices were starting to bake off and dry out. Wondering if my tomatoes were too ripe and burst too soon?  In addition the leftovers the next day were nearly inedible as the texture on the gnocchi became quite weird.
