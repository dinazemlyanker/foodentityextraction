It\u2019s not that big of a deal. I\u2019m not going to censor it behind &?$!, so shield your eyes now.Welcome to HellllllllllllllImagine taping over the second half of your Clockwork Orange VHS with Mad Max. That\u2019s John Dilley\u2019s outfit. Knee-high leather motorcycle boots covered in straps, leather pants, fingerless leather gloves, and a black derby hat. John makes Defcon hot sauces to douse your chicken wings in. At his booth at the 2019 Hot Sauce Expo, I bravely try the Defense Condition #3: Mild Wing Sauce, which is tangy and mostly buttery. He tells me, his gray wiry eyebrows curling up at the edges, that his drunken friends are his \u201ctest dummies\u201d because there\u2019s no one more honest than a drunk. His second hottest sauce, Cluckwing Orange, comes in a bottle with John\u2019s face Photoshopped into the Clockwork Orange poster. The scorpion pepper catches me in the throat and I cough like it\u2019s my first hit of weed. I\u2019m ready for more.Contrary to appearances, John is a sweetheart.\nPhoto by Amy LombardThe last time I was in the Brooklyn Expo Center I took home cutely packaged 100 percent date syrup and walked around with a mango probiotic popsicle. No one was puking. The Hot Sauce Expo has more in common with a Thrasher concert. Gigantic speakers are blasting rock and metal. Tattoos take up more skin than clothing. I lose count of all the beards I see that are also braided. Everyone is sweating and carrying cartons of Farmland Fresh whole milk. I\u2019m fucking psyched, and I don\u2019t even care that deeply about hot sauce. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014I love heat. But I love people more. I love obsession. And I love Metallica.I think most people here know that hot sauce pain doesn\u2019t compare to real pain. Hot sauce pain is cute. Hot sauce pain is pleasure. It might linger for 15 minutes or come back to haunt you in the middle of the night, but it won\u2019t last. This is the thinking that led me to try 47 hot sauces in the six hours I spent at the Expo. I didn\u2019t touch the milk, like some kind of pussy! I packed coconut cookies! I am a PRO. Here are the moments I\u2019ll treasure forever.Everyone is sweating here.\nPhoto by Amy LombardProprietors of Doom.\nPhoto by Amy LombardThe Right Hand of DoomHellfire Hot Sauce\u2019s booth is where I find the largest gathering of braided beards. Everything is branded by Satan. \u201cWhat\u2019s the best sauce?\u201d I ask a man with long, bushy brown hair and kind eyes.\u201cYou mean the hottest?\u201d\u201cNo, the best.\u201d\u201cWell the hottest, you don\u2019t want that one, it\u2019s bad. It\u2019s just terrible.\u201dSo I try Blueberry Hell, which he tells me is \u201cgood on ice cream and pancakes.\u201d It\u2019s spiked with Carolina Reaper (the hottest chile pepper in the world), so no, it\u2019s not sweet. Then I try the tropical Devil\u2019s Gold, which combines four brutally hot peppers with cheerful pineapple and papaya. My tongue burns for ten minutes after, the skin under my eyeglasses sweats (a new place for sweat and me)\u2014this is only a 5/10 from Hellfire.I spoke to two friends who tasted Doom, immediately puked, and loved every minute.\nPhoto by Amy LombardThe hottest Hellfire sauce, Right Hand of Doom, is, according to word of fiery mouth, the hottest sauce here today. Released in March, it has a 6.66 million Scoville rating. \u201cA DEMON SLEEPS INSIDE THIS BOTTLE.\u201d It is officially licensed by the movie Hellboy. It costs $17.98. The horned hero appears on the label, his pec veins bulging. The Hellfire guys admit it doesn\u2019t taste good. \u201cPeople throw up, pass out\u2014but they love it,\u201d says my brown-haired friend. People make pilgrimages to taste it. When I see a man in a billowy blue windbreaker buying some, I ask how he feels. Darren takes off his ball cap and shows me his bald head, which is covered in beads of sweat like a can of condensating Coke at the beach. \u201cI came from Coney Island for this!\u201d he tells me proudly, his eyes bugging out of their sockets.Tahiti Joe came all the way from Florida (obviously).\nPhoto by Amy LombardThe Man from West Palm BeachTahiti Joe is here, in the flesh. By which I mean, he is shirtless, unless you count a black-and-red pepper-printed vest as a shirt. It frames his white chest hair, his tanned skin, and his shell necklace. Joe reminds me of my first boss, the manager of an indoor pool, because they both have yellow ponytails and hate Hillary Clinton. Joe has some delicious, sweet glaze-like sauces, and I sample Mango Meltdown and Apple Ass with veggie straws. His best-selling sauce, TropiGarlic, is already sold out (it\u2019s fantastic, extremely garlicky). I take a moment to appreciate Joe\u2019s alternative labeling for some sauces, like Camel Toe, featuring a busty cartoon woman modeled after Joe\u2019s sister-in-law, and Shart, because it\u2019s named Shart. He sells one called Trumped Up for America, and another called hilLIARy Not for President sauce, both of which have a stale taste.Literally.\nPhoto by Amy LombardDrink from the Fountain of Hot SauceAt the Peppers.com booth I meet the famous Chip Hearn, who is wearing a chicken hat that\u2019s seen better days, its legs dangling over the side of his head. Chip is wearing a Hawaiian-print shirt and a gold chicken wing necklace. There are droplets at his feet, and I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s sweat or spit that spouts from his mouth when he speaks (passionately). \u201cI look at spicy as flavorful,\u201d he tells me.Chip, pontificating.\nPhoto by Amy LombardChip sells his own Georgia peach sauce, but he is a curator of other peoples\u2019 sauces too. He hands me a bottle of a favorite, Guava Gator, which I need to sample on turkey meatballs. He knows it\u2019s a good one when he experiences a phenomenon he calls \u201cmouth surfing\u201d\u2014when the flavor of a sauce transforms on the tongue.Later that afternoon, Chip had changed shirts. Please note the wing bling.\nPhoto by Amy LombardThe Mack Daddy\u201cIf I\u2019m the godfather,\u201d says Chip, \u201cthen Sean is the Mack Daddy.\u201d He\u2019s talking about Sean Evans, the host of First We Feast\u2019s Hot Ones, in which celebrities are interviewed while eating wings dressed in increasingly hotter sauces. When Sean drops into the Expo, crowds swarm him for selfies and hot sauce makers shower him with sauce offerings. \u201cThis is Satan\u2019s blood! You have to try it, it\u2019s ten million Scoville!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s actually killed a person in Wales, you\u2019ve got to try it!\u201d The maker of Clark and Hopkins tells me that when his Assam sauce was featured on Hot Ones, he sold 800 cases in six weeks. Booths tape handwritten signs next to bottles, \u201cAs seen on Hot Ones Season 2!\u201dSean Evans and fans.\nPhoto by Amy LombardI catch Sean for a few minutes outside, near the Jack Daniels cornhole setup, and he says the Expo gets younger and younger every year. He points out that his show has made hot sauce more mainstream, sure, but so has the rise in spicy snack foods (this year Doritos launched a Flamin\u2019 Hot flavor). The people who are into hot sauce are drawn to \u201cextreme things,\u201d he notes. \u201cIf you just walk around here you can see, it\u2019s kind of like a Slayer concert.\u201d He points to a guy nearby with Megadeth-long hair. \u201cYou know how sometimes dogs look like their owners? These hot sauce makers look like their hot sauces.\u201dQueen Majesty\u2019s Charcoal Ghost and my weird wrists.\nPhoto by Amy LombardSauces, ReviewedOne of Sean\u2019s favorites at the show is Queen Majesty\u2019s Scotch Bonnet and Ginger, a delicious sauce that brings fire from chile pepper and warmth from ginger (and sweetness from onions). But my favorite was their new Charcoal Ghost, which has this deep plum backbone and then chocolatey heat from pasilla negra and chipotle chiles. Erika Diehl, the maker, knows what she\u2019s doing.Char Man, from Ojai, California, makes only three sauces and they make them well.\nPhoto by Amy LombardMore of my faves: Char Man\u2019s verde (tangy jalape\u00f1o, minimal ingredient list, makes my upper lip glisten); Hank Sauce\u2019s cilanktro (super vinegary and garlicky); Clark and Hopkins\u2019 Laos (heavy lemongrass, funky dried shrimp, ginger, and apple cider vinegar); Big Red\u2019s God\u2019s Wrath (the Scorpion pepper strikes again); Ghost Scream\u2019s chile garlic jam (sweet heat); and High River\u2019s Cheeba Gold (peaches and...mustard?).By this point, I was really starting to identify with the \u2018Dirty\u2019 bin.\nPhoto by Amy LombardThunder JuiceAt High River Hot Sauces, I meet Chris Caffery, whose straightened blond hair pokes out his trucker hat like a badass scarecrow. This man is a rockstar. If you had to guess which rock band also makes hot sauce, what would you guess? I\u2019ll give you a hint. DA DA DA DAAA DA DA DA DAAA DA DA DA DAAA. That\u2019s me wailing \u201cCarol of the Bells\u201d by TRANS-SIBERIAN ORCHESTRA, friends! That\u2019s right. I met a seasonal rockstar! I swear, this Expo is the BEST.Milk, everywhere.\nPhoto by Amy LombardHigh River makes Thunder Juice, which I heard a man in the crowd describe earlier as \u201cstill sweating my ass off from.\u201d I taste a tiny drop on a plastic spoon and immediately break out in face water. I don\u2019t remember what it tasted like, other than straight heat. Fifteen minutes pass and then I feel a fire within. Above my stomach, below my esophagus. I feel BAD. I zoom to the restroom and take some deep breaths in an honestly very clean toilet stall; this is the only place at the Expo where you can sit down. I remember the smashed and spotted banana at the bottom of my bag and yes, I eat it while sitting on the toilet. Immediately I feel better.Reaper madness.\nPhoto by Amy LombardA Face Full of Carolina ReapersA ponytailed hot sauce maker in a patch-covered denim vest is standing in front of me in the crowd waiting for the Carolina Reaper\u2013eating contest to begin, the grand finale. He sees a friend and tells her, \u201cI can\u2019t wait for this to be done.\u201d Five minutes later, he\u2019s on stage screaming: \u201cARE YOU MOTHERFUCKING READYYYY!\u201d We are! The crowd goes wild. The peppers are glowing cherry red, like Snow White\u2019s apple and just as poisonous. Man was not meant to eat this.Yvonne!!!!\nPhoto by Amy LombardThe winner\u2014whoever eats the most peppers (in weight) in 60 seconds\u2014receives a giant check for $1,000. But the real winner is Yvonne Tortorelli, 32, who comes in third with 71 grams (the winner, Wayne Algenio, ate 95). She was the only woman in the competition, and when Yvonne is on stage, there is a deafening cheer. YVONNE IS OUR HERO. Chugging a half gallon of milk, her eyeliner smudged to hell, covered in a wetness I can\u2019t identify, Yvonne deserves that damn check. Offstage, she follows her girlfriend\u2019s advice and pukes her guts out. In the backroom for the competitors. Outside. Everywhere. Yvonne marked her territory with bright red barf. \u201cAs long as you throw up,\u201d she tells me, \u201cyour ass won\u2019t burn.\u201dThe crowd clears out before the winner is crowned, the final grams announced. They aren\u2019t here to see the flame-covered trophies dispersed. They\u2019re here to witness pain, and to feel it, for just a little bit.I...forgot to mention the Chihuahua beauty contest.\nPhoto by Amy LombardExplore Bon App\u00e9titHot SauceEventsRecipes you want to make.
