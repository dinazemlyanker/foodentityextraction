When something\u2019s so easy to make that you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.Years ago, when I was living in Japan, I became obsessed with a dessert called \u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u30bc\u30ea\u30fc(coffee jelly). My friend Yuko ordered it for me at a small caf\u00e9 that specialized in trendy desserts, and I was delighted when our server brought it to the table: a glass dessert cup filled with jiggly cubes of sweetened, gelatinized coffee topped with a dollop of soft whipped cream. It was love at first spoonful. The coffee taste was surprisingly strong, complex, and natural, as if someone had taken a particularly well-brewed cup of rich, chocolaty dark roast coffee and turned it into Jell-O (not terribly far from the truth!). Each cube was surprisingly firm with just a little chew. My favorite way to eat it is to let each block melt in my mouth so that the coffee flavor gradually washes over my palate. (Fun fact: While I\u2019ve always considered coffee jelly a Japanese dessert, I learned that it actually originated in England in the early 19th century.)After spending too much money trying as many versions as I could, I eventually learned how to make it at home with hot canned coffee and agar-agar. It wasn\u2019t quite as good as that first taste, but 21-year-old me was very proud of himself for figuring it out.When I was developing dessert recipes for my cookbook, The Comic Kitchen, I really wanted to include a version of coffee jelly. Since canned coffee isn\u2019t as ubiquitous in the U.S. as it is in Japan, my old recipe wouldn\u2019t do. After a couple of very caffeinated weeks testing various brewing methods, I decided that cold brew was my favorite. It brings out the more subtle tasting notes in the coffee while allowing me to use less sugar, as I\u2019m not fighting the bitterness that comes with most hot-brewing methods. The end result: Coffee jelly that\u2019s complex and not too sweet with big coffee flavor.I make my own cold-brew concentrate at home (any kind of coffee will do\u2014rich, toasty dark roasts, fruity and floral light roasts), but store-bought concentrate works just as well. Most commercially available brands use a 1:1 ratio of concentrate to water, so that\u2019s what I use here. Not all brands are the same, though, so check the serving instructions and adjust as necessary.Here\u2019s how to make it:Bring 1 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add 2 tsp. agar-agar, 1 Tbsp. granulated sugar, and 1 pinch kosher salt, whisking until dissolved. (I\u2019ve also tested this with gelatin, but I personally much prefer the texture with agar-agar, which turns out firmer and more substantial. Many Asian markets carry agar-agar, but if you have trouble finding it near you, you can always order it online.) Remove from heat, let cool slightly, then stir in 1 cup cold-brew concentrate.Pour mixture into an 8x8\" baking dish, then chill in the fridge until set, at least 2 hours.Meanwhile, beat 1 cup heavy cream and 1 Tbsp. granulated sugar in a medium bowl with a handheld mixer or whisk until soft peaks just begin to form. Cover and chill until ready to serve.When you\u2019re ready to serve, cut the coffee jelly into a grid of roughly \u00bd\"\u2013\u00be\" cubes. Divide into four dessert cups and dollop with the prepared whipped cream. Garnish with chocolate shavings, a dusting of ground cinnamon or sifted unsweetened cocoa powder.Coffee jelly has been part of my repertoire for almost 15 years, generally as a refreshing summer dessert, but sometimes with breakfast or brunch for a more playful caffeine delivery. Every now and then, I\u2019ll have it as an afternoon pick-me-up. It\u2019s delicious anytime of day, but don\u2019t forget it\u2019s caffeinated. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be up all night, dreaming of, what else, coffee jelly.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimpleRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
