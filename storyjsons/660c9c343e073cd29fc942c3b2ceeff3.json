If you can find only thicker-stalked spring onions, cut the stalks in half lengthwise, then into 3\" pieces. Cook the stalks along with the bulbs; they\u2019ll benefit from the extra time.Ingredients2 servings8spring onions3Tbsp. unsalted butter, dividedKosher salt, freshly ground pepper\u00bccup white wine vinegar1cup fresh ricotta1oz. finely grated Parmesan (about \u00bc cup)\u00bdlemon1small garlic clove25x5\" pieces focaccia4large eggs, beaten to blendPreparationStep 1Place a rack in center of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0. Trim woody ends of spring onions. Separate white bulbs from green parts with a knife. Cut bulbs in half through the root end; if size varies wildly, cut larger bulbs into quarters. Cut tender green parts of stalks into 3\" pieces; set aside separately from bulbs.Step 2Heat 2 Tbsp. butter in a 10\" nonstick skillet over medium until foaming. Add onion bulbs and toss to coat in butter; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until deeply golden brown and starting to soften, 4\u20135 minutes. Add vinegar, onion stalks, and \u00bd cup water and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until almost all liquid is cooked off and bulbs are very soft and jammy, 6\u20138 minutes longer. Transfer to a plate. Wipe out skillet.Step 3While onions cook, mix ricotta and Parmesan in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper. Finely grate lemon zest and garlic into ricotta mixture and stir to combine.Step 4Warm focaccia in oven (place directly on rack) until soft and warmed through but not browned, 2\u20133 minutes. Divide between plates. Spread ricotta mixture in swooshing dollops on top of focaccia.Step 5Melt remaining 1 Tbsp. butter in skillet over medium-low heat. Add eggs; season with salt. Cook, stirring frequently in large sweeping figure-eight motions with a spatula, until eggs have set into creamy folds, 1\u20132 minutes.Step 6Divide scrambled eggs between focaccia.

I also used the BA Shockingly Easy No-Knead Focaccia. I used a mix of different spring onions and they turned out very sweet in the end. I would make this again.jslotnickEmeryville, CA4/30/2020Made this with the BA Shockingly Easy No-Knead Focaccia, and it was PERFECT. I didn't encounter any problems with the liquid ratio for the spring onions and loved the super acidic kick it gave the rest of the really rich dish. We ate the dish in three servings, so be ready for a lot of food!lcwassermanBerkeley, California4/3/2020Make it with cornstarch eggs.MASSEY LAMBARDcoastal Alabama2/28/2020Makes a TON of food for two servings. Neither my boyfriend or I could finish ours, would've been better off splitting one. I also couldn't find spring onions and used scallions, so they ended up tasting pretty vinegar heavy. I would cut the total liquid back some, maybe in half. sarahbear518Atlanta, GA6/26/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titSandwichEggRicottaCheeseSpring OnionOnionVegetableScallionSpringSnackNut-FreeVegetarianBreakfastLunchRecipes you want to make.
