But instead of shying away from the subject, she threw herself into it: \u201cIt turned into this obsession,\u201d she says. \u201cIf that\u2019s okay, well then how is this okay? Or this? How do you know if it's not okay? And I just started going down the rabbit hole.\u201dIt\u2019s a quiet, gray Los Angeles afternoon and we\u2019re sitting on the back patio of Alameda Supper Club, a Cal-Italian restaurant from chef Chris Bianco that comprises approximately a third of the recently opened Manufactory complex. Hata serves as the fermentation chef for all of the Manufactory, which, in addition to Alameda Supper Club, includes the more casual Tartine Bianco, as well as a specialty food market and a walk-up counter that sells coffee, bread, and house-made soft-serve.The Manufactory occupies 44,000 square feet, and Hata\u2019s work can be found in nearly every cornerThe idea of a fermentation chef is a relatively new one in professional kitchens, particularly in the French-influenced world of fine dining, which doesn\u2019t traditionally have many ferments on its menus. Rene Redzepi\u2019s Noma put fermentation in the spotlight when it won Restaurant Magazine\u2019s Best Restaurant in the World award in 2010, but most kitchens still don\u2019t dedicate an entire staff position to thinking about and executing fermentation projects. The title isn\u2019t one Hata ever aspired to, mostly because until recently, she didn\u2019t even know it existed.Hata was born and raised in Simi Valley, forty miles north of Los Angeles; after graduating from high school she took a couple of classes at Pasadena City College and spent some time in culinary school before deciding she wasn\u2019t in love with either option. She ended up moving to North Carolina, where she got her first restaurant job at fine dining spot. \u201cI walked in and I'm like, \u2018Hi I want to learn how to cook and do nice food,\u2019\u201d She says. \u201cThe chef just hired me.\u201d And that was that.Hata eventually moved back to California, where she worked at Bouchon Beverly Hills before moving on to The Charter Oak in Napa Valley. Her job title was line cook, but she was using any spare time she could find for her fermentation projects. The kitchens she worked in were happy to support her, she says, but she didn\u2019t have the freedom to experiment that she has now.The Manufactory's kimchi uses leftover ginger, root vegetable tops, and pulp leftover from fresh-squeezed juices.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanThe Manufactory occupies 44,000 square feet, and Hata\u2019s work can be found in nearly every corner. At the bar at Tartine Bianco you can order a Violet Revolver, a bright, fruit-forward cocktail that features a currant-kefir ferment; you can eat chicken hearts that have been marinated in an umami-heavy paste made with Hata\u2019s house-fermented koji rice. The barley in Alameda Supper Club\u2019s barley risotto is fermented before it\u2019s cooked; Hata then takes the liquid left over from that process and turns it into a syrup that gives the Supper Club\u2019s Barely Legal cocktail its smooth, earthy flavor.Bar director CJ Catalano says that collaborating with Hata is one of his favorite parts of the job. \u201cIt's a consistent back and forth on, \u2018how do we make things better?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cShe gets these brilliant ideas and comes to us; we have other ideas and we try to come to her and say, \u2018How do we make this happen?\u2019 It's a mutual admiration.\u201dCamden Herschberger, Tartine Bianco\u2019s chef de cuisine, agrees that having someone to talk with can help spur creativity on days when he feels burned out. Having Hata makes his job feel sustainable \u201cnot just in the food aspect, but also in the emotional and mental aspects as well,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can definitely lean on each other and help each other get through things.\u201dHata\u2019s work spans far beyond the cocktail program: she also makes pickles you can order by the ramekin, as well as kimchi and the kombuchas and shrubs on the restaurants\u2019 zero-proof drink menus. She cultures butter and yogurt, and dries garlic butts and onion ends so she can grind them into powders for the kitchens to use. She\u2019s working on distilling leftover wine into house vinegars. She blends the spice mix for the coffee bar\u2019s chai. The only places you won\u2019t see Hata\u2019s hand in something are the breads and desserts, though she\u2019s working on that, she says: teaming up with the bakery to create a bread that incorporates koji, and with the sweets team on a vinegar sauce called saba.\u201cIt hurts my soul as a person to see things go to waste because it's not a perfect square,\u201d Hata says.Hata is 28 years old and no more than 5\u20192, but she has one of the biggest jobs in the Manufactory. She gets to work around 5 a.m. every morning\u2014she likes to be the first person from the savory team in the kitchen so that she can check on her fermentation projects undistracted, she says. Most days she works for about 12 hours, though she swears she\u2019s \u201cgetting better\u201d about heading out by 3:30 or 4 p.m.Tartine is quietly committed to minimizing food waste, and Hata is critical to turning these culinary gears. \u201cGinger is a beautiful example\u201d of how her position helps minimize organic waste, Hata explains: \u201cWe use the juice in the kombuchas and the bar program; the skins we dry for our chai tea, and I use the pulp in the kimchi. It\u2019s zero-waste.\u201dThe Manufactory's fermentation storage is highly organized.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanThe Manufactory\u2019s kimchi is almost all second-use product: in addition to the ginger, it incorporates root vegetable tops that local farmers\u2019 market vendors save out for her, as well as the pulp leftover from the bar program\u2019s fresh-squeezed juices.An aversion to waste was another element that drew Hata to fermentation. Fine dining restaurants like the ones she came up working in are often very exacting about presentation, which can create a lot of trim: bits and pieces shaved off as a chef tries to turn an irregular piece of produce into an exactly symmetrical shape. \u201cIt hurts my soul as a person to see things go to waste because it's not a perfect square,\u201d Hata says.Now, even a project gone awry can yield useful results: one of the things she\u2019s most excited about is a coriander blossom shrub she stumbled onto by accident. \u201cI was trying to preserve the blossoms in a different way,\u201d Hata says. \u201cBut then they completely disintegrated and fell apart. So I was like, why don't I just cover it in vinegar and call it an infusion?\u201dCoriander blossom shrubs will go onto the Manufactory\u2019s menus this spring. Hata is already looking forward to the next project, packaging some of what she produces to sell as part of the Manufactory\u2019s retail operation. She dreams of selling pickles, kombucha, and her house-dried onion and garlic powders, which will allow Angelenos to buy better spices than the tired dry stuff you find at most grocery stores.When Hata\u2019s not working, she rock climbs and is working on getting her paragliding pilot\u2019s license. \u201cOn my days off, I'm never just resting,\u201d she says. \u201cI like to stay busy and recharge in a different way, even though I'm still doing something physically demanding.\u201dDoes she see a parallel, I ask, between her attraction to the bubbling cauldrons of fermentation and the dangers of these thrill-seeking hobbies?She admits that she gravitates toward things she doesn\u2019t understand.  \u201cI'm scared of it, so I have to learn everything about it. And then I become obsessed.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishFermentationTartineLos AngelesRead MoreLifestyleCortney Burns Is the Godmother of FermentationGallery9 SlidesBy David TamarkinRecipes you want to make.
