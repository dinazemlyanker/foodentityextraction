It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.There are a lot of things I love about my 10-year-old son, but the fact that he\u2019s newly vegetarian isn\u2019t at the top of the list. I know\u2014that sounds super harsh! After all, the guy wants to help save the planet and loves animals, and here I am complaining about it. Truth is, his commitment to a plant-based diet is inspiring to me, but it definitely makes dinnertime complicated. I know it\u2019s important that he get enough protein\u2014both because he\u2019s growing and because it will help him feel satiated for longer stretches of time\u2014and overnight, he eliminated 80 percent of our protein sources. There are only so many ways to cook chickpeas, edamame, and eggs, which I\u2019ve leaned hard on, and when he gets sick of them, it\u2019s game over.Then, of course, there\u2019s tofu. For an eater who has always been\u2014let\u2019s say\u2014selective about his likes and dislikes, the vegetarian\u2019s delight hasn\u2019t been too delightful. We tried soft tofu in brothy soups: \u201cToo mushy.\u201d We tried blending it into creamy dressings, but who\u2019s going to eat a bowl of dressing for dinner? I tried breading it\u2014didn\u2019t work. I tried glazing it: \u201cToo slippery.\u201dWhat I needed was a way to cook tofu that gave it actual crunch without having to dredge it in rice flour or deep fry it in several inches of hot fat. That\u2019s when the method for these tofu crumbles came into our lives. The technique couldn\u2019t be easier, and will feel intuitive for anyone who has pan-roasted a chicken thigh. Hot pan, slick of oil, add protein, cook until crisp. The secret, though, happens before the tofu ever hits the skillet.Want this letter before it hits the website?

The original recipe says to slice the tofu, sandwich it between layers of paper towels, and press with your hands to achieve this. At home, I\u2019ve gotten a little more aggressive: I place the sliced tofu on a rimmed baking sheet that\u2019s been lined with a clean kitchen towel. I fold the towel over the tofu, then put another baking sheet on top of that, and weigh it down with something heavy\u2014a bottle of olive oil or big can of tomatoes work well. Then I prep the rest of the meal while the tofu is being squozen, usually about 10\u201315 minutes.When it\u2019s fry time, I tear the tofu into raggedy 2- to 3-inch pieces, so their edges will have more exposed bits to get crunchy, similar to how hand-torn torn croutons have more texture opportunities. Drizzle some neutral oil into a cast-iron pan over medium-high heat, then cook the tofu, undisturbed, until browned on the underside and they release cleanly from the pan when you wedge a metal spatula underneath. Turn and repeat on second side. Once the tofu comes out of the pan, season it with salt right away. I serve it like any other simply prepared piece of protein, with a little hot sauce and soy sauce to dip it into, maybe\u2014but it doesn\u2019t have to be more complicated than that. The unadorned flavor of packaged tofu may be subtle, but these crumbles are as crunchy and addictive as popcorn shrimp, and there\u2019s no trawling involved.Get the recipe:Spicy Tofu CrumblesTry this versatile protein-packed side/condiment/snack tossed into stir-fries, as a burrito filling, or folded into saut\u00e9ed greens.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterTofuVegetarianWeeknightRead MorecookingIf Tofu Scramble Can Fuel My CrossFit Workouts, It Can Keep You Satisfied Until Lunch\u00a0By Lukas VolgercookingTofu That\u2019s Crispy and Glazed All at the Same TimeBy Adam RapoportcookingI Have This Tofu-Kimchi Soup Recipe MemorizedBy Sasha LevinecookingI\u2019ve Always Liked Tofu, But This Recipe Made Me Love ItBy Elyse InamineRecipes you want to make.
