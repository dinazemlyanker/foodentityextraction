A pair of brightly colored earrings takes my all-black outfits from 0 to 60. A chunky belt, not so much. Now\u2014stay with me\u2014aren\u2019t sides, like, the accessory of a meal? They can transform a meal into something transcendent, especially when it comes to barbecue. Sides round out all that meat with acid (pickles!), crunch (slaw!), carbs (mac and cheese!). That\u2019s why I\u2019d like to introduce you to the humble side that completes any meat spread: the smoky, tangy collard greens from Buxton Hall in Asheville, North Carolina.In 2016, this very publication named Buxton Hall one of the best new restaurants in the country for many reasons: the shreddy and flavorful Eastern Carolina-style pulled pork, the endless list of perfect desserts (looking at you, brown-butter crumble). During a trip to Asheville last summer, I couldn\u2019t wait to dive, mouth first, into the juicy, fatty pork, piling it high on slightly sweet cornbread. But then I scooped up a mound of those collard greens, and I was like WOW.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Chef Elliot Moss is clearly a collards whisperer. Where other collards suffer\u2014soupy, under-seasoned, mushy\u2014Moss soars. He braises them for two hours in lots of rendered pork fat and pork broth (double pork!), which gives the collard greens a salty, luscious flavor. And don\u2019t you worry: To balance out the fat, he finishes the dish with a hit of vinegar. This side blew my mind\u2014I almost missed my flight back to New York City (another story for another time). So yes, the melt-in-your-mouth pork is worth a trip to Asheville, but those tender, smoky collard greens make the meal.Go there: Buxton HallIf you can\u2019t\u2014get the recipe for Buxton\u2019s other collard greens, with bacon and beans added in:Smoky Tangy Greens and BeansView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendAsheville, NCBarbecueRecipes you want to make.
