If you can\u2019t find Italian frying peppers or just aren\u2019t feeling them, grilled eggplant or zucchini would also work well here.Ingredients8 servings\u00bdcup walnuts6Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more for drizzling4sweet Italian frying peppers or Anaheim chiles1\u00bdcups whole-milk ricotta1lemon6medium Persian cucumbers (about 1 lb.), sliced on a deep diagonal1cup mint leaves, torn if largePreparationStep 1Place a rack in upper third of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0.

I've made it with and without mint, which seems to always be a love it or leave it thing, and so far without mint has won. In lieu of the mint, I use basil olive oil as part of the dressing instead of regular olive oil.AnonymousSC8/16/2021I made this salad exactly as directed. I found the peppers a delightful addition however as a whole salad I found it disappointing and lacking of flavour. I will now doctor this recipe. Thanks for a starting point.\n MEZMaryEllenWindsor,ont. Ca.1/24/2021Omg. How could these go together so well?! We used anaheims and I went with smaller slices of regular cucumber when I couldn't find Persian. These ingredients seemed like an odd combo to me (mint and peppers? walnuts and cucumbers?) but man, it was so fun to eat. Got my wheels turning for similar pairings. Great recipe, Andy.yagurlcarlyTucson, Arizona6/20/2020This recipe was a big hit. I couldn't find Italian frying peppers or Anaheim chiles, so I ended up using roasted red and yellow peppers. I cheated since I had a jar of them on hand. It made it a bit quicker to make, and I feel like it didn't compromise the dish. So refreshing. So easy. So delish.AnonymousLos Angeles6/17/2020This recipe is a great way to feature peppers and cucumbers. I used basil instead of mint and hazelnuts instead of walnuts since those were ingredients I had on hand. Recommend 400 degree oven for about 15 minutes (flipping once midway through) if you don\u2019t have a gas cooktop you can char them over\u2014Anaheim peppers have too many ridges to char well in the pan. I also added the acid of a squeezed half of lemon and a vinegary pique hot sauce. Even with the lemon zest flavor, it still benefitted from the acid to balance the bitterness of the charred peppers. CherylbadgerTacoma, WA6/6/2020I ADORE this dish AND it got me to eat peppers and walnuts, two things I normally dislike! I had trouble getting the giant Anaheim chiles I picked to char evenly in the pan on the stovetop so I ended up throwing them in the oven at 400 till soft. I served mine with leftover roasted chicken breast and soft lebanese pita bread for extra heft. It's such a perfect representation of summer flavours!AnonymousIraq/Armenia5/9/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titRicottaCheeseWalnutNutCucumberVegetableAnaheim ChileChileSummerEasyQuickSideGluten-FreeVegetarianHealthyishDinnerRecipes you want to make.
