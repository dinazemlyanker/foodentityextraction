Baharat is a spice mixture typically made with paprika, black pepper, cinnamon, coriander, cumin, and cardamom. You can also use it to season steaks before grilling, or toss through root veg before roasting.Ingredients4 servings2garlic cloves, finely grated2teaspoons baharat or ras-el-hanout6tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling46-ounce skin-on, boneless red snapper filletsKosher salt1lemon, halved3medium Persian cucumbers, peeled, sliced \u00bc inch thick1medium shallot, thinly sliced into rings, rinsed, patted dry1cup cilantro with tender stemsPreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 425\u00b0.

It all came together so beautifully. It is a light meal with red snapper we used ras el halout, with the added lemon zest at end wow great flavor. The cucumber shallot salad is a great pair with this dish I can\u2019t imagine a better side dish. *we did cook our snapper longer by 5 minutes, we are used to salmon so thought it was still under done, do not cook longer the fish continued to cook and was dry by the time we finished eating. We will be making again! Thank you   Ellie PippaNew Albany, Ohio6/24/2021Cucumber salad is simple but delicious.  I loved using the ras-el-hanout on the fish.  It perfumed the fish but didn't take away from the flavor.  It might have been my cut of fish, but I've had better success using parchment paper and would probably use that method and then put the skin side up under the broiler for a minute or two.  Some parts of my fish turned out pretty tough.  Served with a koresh bademjan and basmati rice.  Rebecca QIndianapolis11/18/2020I made this with a seven spice blend instead of baharat since I couldn't find it in my international market and red that it could be used as a replacement for ras-el-hanout. The fish turned out okay, I'll have to try baharat next time to see if it knocks my socks off next time. Otherwise, it was just baked fish, nothing too special. The Persian cucumber salad was super delicious though. As someone who typically hates salad and cucumbers, I found this super refreshing and the portion size to be perfect. I can see myself making that as a side for a lot of dishes.
