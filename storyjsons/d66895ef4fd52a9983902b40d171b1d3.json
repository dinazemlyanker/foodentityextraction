Steaming the cabbage over low heat gently cooks the layers until tender and allows the creamy and velvety sauce to coat them quickly.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

An old Louisiana boy, that andouille sausage, is going to put this dish over the top for him, and hot honey ? Brilliant, but I use Chipotle powder rather than Cayenne for added smokiness., \n\nThank you BA staff, going in my little recipe tin for sure.\n\nOr, as my fella would put it Aaaaiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeeee !Kynthia the fustrated chefCali born - midwest located.3/15/2022Wow.  Definitely make this.  I didn't have bacon, but did everything else.  Soooo good. LibbyCorpus Christi2/21/2022This recipe was really good! I made this and did a lemon pepper pork tenderloin on the bbq for dinner for my husband and myself and it was amazing! This dish was really easy to make! The cabbage took only about 1.5 hours and it was starting to fall apart. I might cook it for a shorter time next time because I did want to make sure that it sat in the sauce for a while to soak up the yummy cream sauce so by the time that it was all really finished, some of the cabbage wedges were a little too soft. The hot honey was a perfect addition to the cabbage as well as the pork (my husband poured the hot honey over the pork and the salad)! Definitely make the herb salad to throw on top because the citrus from it really ties the whole dish together. We will definitely be adding this to our list of dinners! Bri M.
