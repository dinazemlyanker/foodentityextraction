Steep It, Don\u2019t Cook ItTender, juicy shrimp, squid, and fish, no splatter in sight.By Ned BaldwinJune 18, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto By Emma Fishman, Food Stying by Susie TheodorouFacebookTwitterEmailI\u2019m a dad and a chef, which means I\u2019m busy and, truthfully, a little absentminded. So whether I\u2019m cooking at home for my family or at work in my restaurant kitchen, I gravitate toward simple techniques that are forgiving and hard to screw up. Steeping fish is at the top of that list.Many fish recipes call for hot and fast cooking, like pan-roasting or broiling, where the risk of smoke and splatter is high and the juicy and tender \u201cdoneness window\u201d is brief. If it passes you by, you\u2019re left with a dry, tough, fishy-tasting result and a smelly, messy kitchen. Steeping, on the other hand, is slow and gentle, meaning that it doesn\u2019t require constant vigilance. The doneness window is wide, which gives you a high probability of serving your fish at its best, plus the technique is odorless and requires no additional fat.So what is steeping? Simply put, it\u2019s the practice of pouring hot water over something or adding something to hot water\u2014think tea leaves\u2014and letting it sit until it\u2019s ready to consume. That something might be squid, shrimp, or many of the finned fishes like cod, salmon, or sea bass. Timing-wise, squid cooks faster than shrimp, and cod takes a bit longer than both. When I cook squid or shrimp, I pour hot water over the seafood or add it to a pot of just-boiled liquid and leave the pot to rest off the stove until the ingredient is cooked (it takes just a few minutes), no additional heat needed. (Cod, depending on the thickness of the piece, may need a little more time on the lowest heat to cook all the way through. I lift the cod out of the water with a spatula and check to see if the flakes separate cleanly. When they do, the fish is ready to eat.)There\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t steep in plain water, but I like to season it up. If I\u2019m cooking at the beach, I often walk right down to the water\u2019s edge and collect some seawater in which to steep my catch. If I\u2019m at home, I improvise \u201cseawater\u201d by salting the water and adding a piece of kombu. Seawater is fantastic for tender-fleshed fish like cod and salmon. For shrimp and squid, which have inherently stronger flavors, I prefer to use a more robust liquid. Often that\u2019s a simple court-bouillon (a quickly cooked broth), which I make by adding a little vinegar, sugar, salt, and some aromatics like onion, garlic, and bay leaves to the water.Both at home and at work, I rely on a short list of reliable methods that I know will work every time. Steeping is high on the list because it yields a perfectly cooked ingredient that I can integrate into a more elaborate dish, like spicy shrimp salad with sambal and peanuts or cod with six-minute eggs, lemon, Dijon-caper sauce, and a soft herb salad. The hardest part\u2014the fish cooking\u2014is simple, which leaves me room to focus on the fanciful part: playing with flavor, texture, and color.The best part about steeping fish, however, is that it doesn\u2019t matter whether you get distracted by a colleague, a child, or a shiny object\u2014whatever you\u2019ve got going will likely still work out all right.Recipes you want to make.
