Have a question? Email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.How do I do Thanksgiving for one without an inordinate amount of leftovers? \u2014All Alone AndreaMy sister did this last year and gave rave reviews. She made ONLY her favorites (all BA recipes because she is supportive of my career): mashed potatoes, green bean casserole, cornbread stuffing with chorizo, \u201cmaybe a salad?\u201d, and cranberry-lime pie for dessert. That\u2019s right\u2014no turkey. She halved everything but the pie. Let this inspire you.Illustration by Cari Vander YachtWe need an answer once for all: What time should the Thanksgiving meal be served? \u2014Horological Hal\u00a0Cocktails at 5:30 p.m., dinner at 7! 10? 8:30? Is anyone going to actually listen to ME? Every family seems to have their Thanksgiving hour set in stone (Plymouth Rock? Oof). I swear the 3 p.m. diners wait an entire year to eat at their off-kilter hour. Whatever time the host says, we comply\u2014and complain. It\u2019s a point of contention as predictable as the mashed potato lumps. Accept both.I\u2019ve met two people who do themed Thanksgivings. Hollywood theme, nautical. Is this weird enough to work? \u2014Mystified Madison\u00a0Themed Thanksgiving sounds weird, but then again, so does celebrating the verrrrrrry murky story of our nation\u2019s founding. Maybe the best thing about Thanksgiving is the fact that we all celebrate it a little differently. I\u2019m thinking about boiling lobsters!Illustration by Cari Vander YachtAre we supposed to mash together everything on the plate? \u2013Jumbled JoJo\u00a0Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop it right there. No. The only time these dishes should commingle is in the inexplicable, very real product that is Thanksgiving dinner-flavored candy corn.Can I put raisins in stuffing? \u2014Miffed Melissa\u00a0Once my [redacted family member] made a casserole for a church picnic that no one ate, so she brought it home. \u201cThe raisins in this are great!\u201d my dad said, eating the leftovers. They were flies. Even THAT wasn\u2019t a good occasion for raisins.Illustration by Cari Vander YachtWhat if we just skip Thanksgiving this year? What can we do instead? \u2014Substitute Selene\u00a0Yes! I love canceling plans so much that I get separation anxiety when I leave my couch. Plus, with rising COVID-19 cases across the country, the last thing we need to do right now is gather indoors with often older relatives. Terrible idea. Take the year off and have fun with the opportunity to do whatever you want. Here are some fantastic ideas for alternate Thanksgivings:Marathon every Friends Thanksgiving episode while eating elaborate nachos.Go for a long and lonely hike with a thermos of soup and your thoughts.Online shop (the #deals!) until your eyes blur and your thighs burn.See what\u2019s up at the beach.Light a pumpkin spice candle and summon your ancestors.Season your cast-iron pans by making 14 batches of bacon; eat bacon.Cry a little bit.Find something lost.Donate to your local food bank, duh!When is it acceptable to pick up a slice of pumpkin pie and eat it like a pizza? \u2014Chaotic Chelsea\u00a0Standing at the fridge at 7:07 a.m. in your night pajamas? Always. At the dinner table in your day pajamas? Never.Illustration by Cari Vander YachtIs it appropriate to catapult spoonfuls of mashed potatoes at relatives as a punishment for their bad behavior? \u2014Knockout Kennedy\u00a0In an election/pandemic/devastating fire year? YES! This is what we\u2019ve come to.How do I avoid a Thanksgiving Zoom? \u2014Evasive EdgarEveryone sent me this question! You don\u2019t want to coordinate and do tech support for 26 family members while simultaneously trussing a turkey and \u201chaving a great time\u201d? Huh, strange. I wrote this in August, but I sensed, based on the bros at the frat house playing germ pong a few blocks away from me, that this infectious world wasn\u2019t going to be much different in November. And somehow now it\u2019s worse. Tell your fam you\u2019re going to be frantically cooking all day but you can pop in to say hello for five minutes at 11:35 a.m. Set your timer for six minutes and when it goes off during the call, say, \u201cOHMYGOSH THAT\u2019S MY PIE!\u201d and Shut. That. Screen.Illustration by Cari Vander YachtIf you have to leave early, can you request pie to go? \u2014Rushed Rahm\u00a0Yes, especially if you\u2019re headed out to work. Thank you, essential workers! Hazard pay, paid time off, and pie for all. Grateful to ya.Explore Bon App\u00e9titEtiquetteThanksgivingIs It Ever OkayRecipes you want to make.
