Tanoreen has been around since 1998 and serves a steady menu of Middle Eastern food meant for sharing. It's the kind of place you go to when you're forced to find a place for picky eaters, snobby eaters, and that one annoying friend who can never decide what he wants. Tanoreen is for everyone.ORDER: lots of dips to start, and definitely the fried brussels sprouts with pomegranate and garlic-panko breadcrumbs. For entrees, we particularly love the baked eggplant as well as the fetti, a combination of toasted pita, rice pilaf, lamb, and a yogurt-tahini sauce. You must get the knafeh, a rosewater-scented cheese and phyllo pastry, for dessert. We'll go on record saying it's one of the best desserts in New York, and worth the subway ridge to Bay Ridge if you're coming from Manhattan.THE VIBE: feels like the whole neighborhood is out to dinner, and they've brought friends. Chef Rawia Bishara often goes table to table in the dining room, chatting with customers and talking about her food. It's lively but not too noisy\u2014just the kind of place you want to be in, even if the decor feels slightly dark and dated.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day: Tuesday to Thursday, from noon to 10 p.m.; Friday, from noon to 10:30 p.m.; Saturday, from 10:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.; and Sunday, from 10:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. Closed Monday.
