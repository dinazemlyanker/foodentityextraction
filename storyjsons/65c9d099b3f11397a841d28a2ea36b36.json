You\u2019ll find recipes she\u2019s cooking, stories she\u2019s loving, where she\u2019s been eating, and more. It gets better: If you\u00a0sign up for our newsletter, you\u2019ll get this letter before everyone else.What kind of cook are you? Do you sit down on Sunday and plan your meals for the rest of the week, or do you flip through the pages of BA at 4 p.m. to figure out what\u2019s for dinner at 8? In the summer I lean toward the latter. With near endless daylight and ubiquitous farm stands, I can almost get away with it. But with the end of summer and the return of tight schedules, it\u2019s time to get more organized. Our series of pantry recipes comes to the rescue with wonderful weeknight meals and plenty of intel to make dinner faster, easier, and tastier. We\u2019ve also got a braising collection that\u2019s perfect for autumn. There\u2019s Braised Short Ribs With Onions and Curry Leaves, an update on a classic, as well as Braised Tofu and Chiles, a speedy midweek braise\u2014yes, a weekday braise\u2014and so much more.For this month\u2019s \u201cAll on the Table,\u201d Dani Shapiro, a writer I admire and one of my favorite podcasters, recalls the time she met her biological father for the first time and what she could (and couldn\u2019t) eat in the emotional aftermath. This refreshing take on comfort food is inspired by her story, and the main ingredient, tomatoes, is abundant at the farm stands if you\u2019re lucky enough to live near one.Two other stories I\u2019m moved to share: As we know, 9/11 was a national tragedy that affected so many families, including those tied to the restaurant industry. In a tribute to our colleagues in restaurants, Peter Kaminsky looks at how nearly two decades later the industry was challenged again. I\u2019m also keen to debut culinary authority Bryant Terry\u2019s new book, Black Food. A chef-in-residence at San Francisco\u2019s Museum of the African Diaspora, Terry has set a new standard with a book that artfully combines recipes from different contributors alongside essays, poetry, and photography. I can already smell Jocelyn Delk Adams\u2019s cake with its fragrant mix of vanilla and cinnamon.More weeknight faves:1 / 55ChevronChevronOne-Pot Gingery Chicken and Rice With Peanut SauceView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCultureLetter From The EditorRecipes you want to make.
