If your family tree is rooted in the Deep South like mine, you have strong opinions on which auntie makes the best banana pudding and whether or not sugar belongs in cornbread. Even if you\u2019ve never set foot on Southern soil, you\u2019ve probably been lucky enough to try some of the region\u2019s most iconic dishes, like flaky buttermilk biscuits, crumbly peach cobbler, and fluffy sweet potato pie (which is miles better than pumpkin pie; you simply cannot change my mind).But Southern baking\u2013like most of the region\u2019s historic foodways\u2013is more than just an amalgam of timeless treats: Many of the South\u2019s most cherished baking traditions are vestiges of the lives and livelihoods of enslaved Africans and their descendants. Black women, in particular, originated many of the innovative recipes that the white women they cooked for would publish and profit from. This whitewashing erased generations of Black women\u2019s contributions to Southern culinary culture, a long legacy that chefs and food historians are working to fully uncover to this day.While many conversations on Southern baking still tiptoe around this complicated history, Back in the Day bakery co-owner and Southern Restaurants for Racial Justice cofounder Cheryl Day is here to set the record straight: \u201cWe are the creators of this cuisine,\u201d Day tells me, holding my Blackness in tandem with hers for a brief moment. \u201cI want [Black] folks to be really proud of the fact that Southern baking is something that we created.\u201d Day\u2019s pride in her craft and heritage shines brightly through the pages of her newest cookbook, Cheryl Day\u2019s Treasury of Southern Baking, out November 9.Cheryl Day's Treasury of Southern Baking$40 $37 at Bookshop.org$40 $34 at Amazon\u201cThis book would not have been possible without the millions of enslaved laborers who worked in the fields, plantations, and kitchens of the United States,\u201d Day writes in the book\u2019s dedication. \u201cMy great-great-grandmother Hannah Queen Grubbs was born enslaved in 1838 and was among the women who created many of these Southern recipes.\u201d Featuring over 200 original and adapted scratch-made recipes beautifully captured by food photographer Angie Mosier, Cheryl Day\u2019s Treasury of Southern Baking is a masterful work, bringing centuries of Southern food, hospitality, and culture into homes across America and around the world.\u201cI consider my heritage, my ancestors, and the recipes that were passed down to me some of my greatest treasures,\u201d Day tells me. As the title implies, Treasury of Southern Baking is an invaluable trove of collective knowledge representing Day\u2019s two greatest passions: food and history. \u201cThere were so many recipes I wanted to include, and it just kept growing and growing,\u201d she says of the extensive recipe selection process. \u201cI talked to all the people in my community, looked through my vast collection of cookbooks, and came to the decision that these are anything that you would ever want if you are a Southern baker.\u201dPhoto by Angie MosierWhen Cheryl Day says \u201canything that you would ever want,\u201d oh, boy, does she mean it. Drawing inspiration from vintage cookbooks, old church bake sale ledgers, handwritten family recipes, and more, Treasury of Southern Baking is a master class in making memorable baked goods. Heck, three of the book\u2019s 13 chapters are dedicated to cakes alone, drawing distinct lines between gathering cakes (the kind usually made on a sheet tray for picnics and baby showers), layer cakes (those gorgeous gals stacked high and slathered with frosting), and loaf and Bundt cakes (like this decadent, ganache-enrobed sweet potato number).If you\u2019re looking to satisfy more than your sweet tooth, don\u2019t worry. Beyond the cakes, pies, cookies, and other confections that make up the bulk of the book, Treasury of Southern Baking also features a hefty helping of savory recipes, from spicy jalape\u00f1o corn sticks to whole wheat mushroom hand pies to, yes, four kinds of biscuits. \u201cIf you\u2019re a Southern baker, you need more than just one biscuit recipe,\u201d Day says matter-of-factly.As educational as it is expansive, Treasury of Southern Baking sprinkles informative sidebars throughout its chapters; there\u2019s a guide on cake-decorating techniques, a cheat sheet on hosting with Southern hospitality, and even a step-by-step process for peeling ripe peaches with precision. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to have to pick up another book,\u201d Day says. \u201cIf you were interested in the craft of Southern baking, I wanted it to all be in this book, and I feel like we accomplished that.\u201dAt its heart, Treasury of Southern Baking celebrates the most important ingredient of all, as cheesy as it may be: love. \u201cSouthern food is a m\u00e9lange of cultural influences,\u201d Day notes in the book\u2019s introduction. \u201cTastes and flavor profiles vary from region to region, and yet it all represents love and treasured memories of our mosaic heritage.\u201dWhile her skill and expertise with Southern baking are made evident by the book\u2019s breadth alone, Day\u2019s dedication and love for the craft\u2013and for the Black women who birthed it\u2013set this towering tome apart from every baking book I\u2019ve ever read. \u201cThis is a way for me to pass on the legacy of our ancestors,\u201d Day says, her exuberance echoing over the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s really the book that I wish I always had, and I am just excited that I am the person to bring this forward.\u201dBake like Cheryl Day:Sweet Potato Loaf Cake With Dark Chocolate GanacheThis tender, gently spiced cake enrobed in dark chocolate ganache requires that you make your own sweet potato pur\u00e9e.
