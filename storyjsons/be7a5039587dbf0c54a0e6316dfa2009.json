I make it as written, more or less, with the addition of toasted pine nuts. Subtle and delicious. AnonymousCanada2/19/2022We love this recipe. We use Campanelle pasta with it. So, so good! And it has been a joy to cook during the pandemic \u2014 it takes time, lots of love to pull it off. Thank you!!!AnonymousOklahoma 1/24/2022All the Parm in the world can\u2019t doctor this bland recipe. All the other reviewers were right- don\u2019t water your time.AnonymousFresno, CA9/13/2021This is our latest obsession and on a weekly rotation through the summer. I frequently add a can of cannelloni beans or lentils at the same time that I add the pasta to make this more filling for our meatless nights. My husband isn\u2019t usually a fan of vegetarian dinners but loves this one. MPK143bonappetite8/13/2021Perfection. It didn\u2019t take long to get the squash to a beautiful jammy texture, used a little extra lemon to wake it up and a good handful of chopped basil mixed in at the very end right before serving. Agreed with other commenters that 12oz of pasta is too much for the squash ratio. Used a mixture of baby zucchini\u2019s and patty pans. Will be making again ASAP AnonymousVancouver BC8/3/2021This recipe is a lot of work. It takes a long time for the zucchini to cook. I did not think the results were worth the effort. The zucchini cooked down to almost nothing and was overwhelmed by the pasta. I added more salt and lemon to get a better flavor but the zucchini sauce was not enough to really flavor the pasta. Wendy SquiresPortland, Oregon7/3/2021This has made the regular dinner rotation in my house, and I NEVER get sick of it! Like other people have said, it\u2019s endlessly riffable, but more importantly it comes together super fast! AnonymousShirley, IL12/6/2020Call me crazy but I added a splash of red wine vinegar to the pan halfway through cooking the zucchini and I have to say it was a success. Very tasty, very hearty.AnonymousLondon, UK11/29/2020Easy, excellent recipe. Our toddlers love it, too - it tastes kind of like fancy Mac & Cheese. This recipe is also a great foundation for substitutions - I added a bunch of sliced mushrooms I had laying around recently and that was delicious as well.AnonymousColorado9/21/2020Good and easy! I had a 9oz package of cheese tortellini that I used for the pasta and used the juice of an entire lemon. AnonymousNYC9/10/2020This dish really lets the squash shine and I used Italian heirloom 'Costata Romanesco' for the first time. (Wow). I agree with other reviewers that you should use less pasta and and more lemon. I used Costo whole wheat  spaghetti and it still turned out really well. Had some pecorino I needed to use so threw some in in addition to the 2oz of parm and instead of Aleppo I used a combo Silk Chili, Black Urfa Chili, and Smoked Paprika. SnicklefrtizColorado8/12/2020So tasty and such a great way to use up some of the summer squash and zucchini we\u2019re drowning in come late July. Like others said, 8oz of pasta is likely all that\u2019s required. I make sure that a bit of brown crust appears in the pan when cooking the veg, deglazing with pasta water to mix all that goodness into the sauce that develops. Love the subtle, earthy heat of Aleppo pepper, but suspect smoked paprika/some red pepper flakes would do as well. A summer recipe keeper for sure. Salt with care as the pasta water and cheese add quite a bit on their own. I just added a pinch more. AnonymousNew Hampshire 8/3/2020This was delicious- loved the \u201cjammy\u201d squash. As was mentioned by some of the reviewers, I used 8oz pasta and added an extra 1/2 Tbsp of lemon juice and some zest. I didn\u2019t have Aleppo pepper so substituted sweet paprika and cayenne in the ratio of 3:1. I would definitely make it again. Susan ThorntonArlington VA8/1/2020Really delicious. Used 8 oz pasta and double the lemon and it was perfect. Do be careful salting the pasta water - I had to use quite a bit for the sauce and probably ended up a touch too salty with the final dish.AnonymousRochester,  NY7/17/2020This was delicious.  Aleppo pepper and summer squash are a perfect pair.  Used rotini pasta.  Lovely.
