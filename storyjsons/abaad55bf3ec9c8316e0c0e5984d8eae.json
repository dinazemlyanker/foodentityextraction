Typically, raw garlic is grated directly into the yogurt, but in this version we fry thinly sliced garlic in the spiced brown butter that gets drizzled over the entire dish. The resulting crunchy, golden brown garlic chips and the crisped-up torn bread lend textural balance to the soft eggs. Use the bread to sop up every last bit of runny yolk and creamy yogurt\u2014it\u2019s your side of toast built right in! \u2014Mehreen KarimIf this is your first time dropping eggs into simmering water, our guide to poaching eggs can help take out the intimidation factor.

Cold eggs are no Bueno, cold bread pieces not so much.  I think straining the yogurt for a few minutes it will be more spreadable and not get watery in this mixture.Adobe Bluealpharetta ga3/13/2022I would have my toast and all other components ready before I cook the eggs.  Cold eggs could ruin the whole thing.  Also if you drain your yogurt in a strainer with a paper towel between the yogurt and the stainer, your yogurt texture will be thicker and not get so watery with your toast.Adobe Bluealpharetta ga3/13/2022This is a delicious recipe, I followed it to the letter except did not have any fresh herbs for garnish. My wife and I loved this dish.Kent NickellShelbyville, IN3/12/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titBreakfastLunchQuickWeeknight MealsEggYogurtOther IngredientsGarlicVegetableTurkishMiddle EasternSaut\u00e9SimmerPoachAleppo-Style PepperHerbs & SpicesNut-FreeVegetarianHealthyishRecipes you want to make.
