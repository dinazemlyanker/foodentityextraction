You can also swap in other cruciferous veg like cabbage or broccoli rabe, both of which are excellent when grilled. \u2014Rachel GurjarAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Resting cauliflower on crown and starting at stem end, cut lengthwise into thirds. Trim off outer edges of crown from both outside pieces to create three 1\"-thick steaks; reserve trimmed-off florets for another use. Repeat with broccoli. Arrange broccoli and cauliflower steaks on a large baking sheet; drizzle with oil and season both sides with salt.Step 4Prepare a grill for medium indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off). Place broccoli and cauliflower on grate over indirect heat. Cover and grill until tender, 15\u201320 minutes. Uncover and move steaks over to direct heat; continue to grill until they are golden brown and edges are charred, about 2 minutes per side.Step 5Arrange lentils on a platter and drizzle half of the chutney over.

I had a hard time grocery shopping, though, for heads of both broccoli and cauliflower that would yield 3 1-inch steaks.  We wound up with broccoli \"drumsticks\" and two cauliflower steaks.  Next time, I would just roast the broccoli and cauliflower in the oven - can get just as good of browning without drying out - and essentially make a grain bowl.Jackie MMadison, WI9/11/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titCauliflowerVegetableBroccoliGreen LentilLentilSideMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeVeganVegetarianGrillingDinnerRecipes you want to make.
