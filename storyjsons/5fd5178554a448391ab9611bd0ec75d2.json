You can\u2019t deny that convenience! But now that I\u2019ve made our new roast chicken with bell peppers recipe, I might be converted to the DIY lifestyle. It is a simple, flavorful chicken with only a few ingredients: lemon, thyme, shallot, and charred-then-roasted bell peppers (which double as a rack for the chicken). This is the kind of recipe that makes me want to host a dinner party\u2014maybe even on a weeknight!\u2014because it\u2019s a twofer: a side dish and main all in one.Scooping up the caramelized roasted peppers with a bite of chicken is a great combination, but you can take it to the next level by turning the veg into a dish of its own. All you need to do is buy two extra ingredients: fresh mozzarella and basil. Add those and a little olive oil and vinegar to the roasted bell peppers that cooked until tender underneath the roast chicken. Ta-da: roasted pepper Caprese, one of our Healthyish farmers\u2019 market challenge recipes from earlier this summer. (The chicken recipe doesn\u2019t call for garlic but the Caprese does, so it wouldn\u2019t hurt to add in a few crushed cloves underneath the bird. Garlic is never a bad idea.)Roasted pepper Caprese is a built-in side dish wonder.\nThe chicken gets a sweet flavor from cooking on top of the bell peppers\u2014we love roasting chickens on stuff\u2014but there\u2019s also some heat from an added Fresno chile (I used a jalape\u00f1o!). If I had to give this recipe one criticism, it is that the juiciness of the roasted peppers makes the skin of the chicken thighs a little soggy, but the crispy skin on the breasts makes up for it. After the 60 minute mark, I used an instant-read thermometer to make sure the thickest part of the breast was 160\u00b0, and let it rest for 10 minutes, allowing the juices to mingle with the peppers instead of running all over my cutting board.For a dinner party, I would have carved it and arranged it beautifully on a platter. But since I was alone...I ate a drumstick while standing over the sink, put a large piece of bell pepper and a slice of mozzarella on a piece of baguette, and shredded up the rest of the chicken for lunches all week. On salads, in soups, or on a big hoagie roll, these leftovers will keep the party going. Sorry, rotisserie chicken. Maybe we\u2019ll get back together next summer when it\u2019s too hot to turn on the oven. Until then, I\u2019m making this at least a monthly routine, and eating all the crispy skin myself.Get the recipe:Roast Chicken with Bell Peppers, Lemon, and ThymeHow to pull off a weeknight roast chicken: Set it over a bed of peppers for a two-for-one deal.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titroast chickenChickenMeal PrepBell PepperRed PepperRead MorecookingHow to Roast Red Peppers at Home Like a Minor Character on 'The Sopranos'By Alex DelanycultureMy Strategy for Staying Sane When Throwing a Dinner PartyBy Sarah JampeltechniquesHow to Roast a Chicken: The Ultimate Recipe, Tips, and MoreBy Amiel StanekrecipesMeal Prep These 97 Big-Batch Recipes and Eat Well All WeekGallery97 SlidesBy Alyse WhitneyRecipes you want to make.
