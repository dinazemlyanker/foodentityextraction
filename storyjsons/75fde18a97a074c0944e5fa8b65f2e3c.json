Because whatever instinct steered you to a website called Healthyish probably also led you to this \u201cit\u201d healthyish beauty line. Free of controversial ingredients like silicones, drying alcohols, and fragrances, Drunk Elephant was one of the first brands to hit the skincare scene, and it surpassed the competition quickly after.Do a quick Google-search for \u201cDrunk Elephant reviews\u201d and it\u2019ll pull up pages and pages of gushing testimonials and breathless \u201cI tried it!\u201d blog posts. Unlike other natural skincare brands, which often skimp on science, founder Tiffany Masterson created the brand to be both clean and clinical, meaning the products still pack a punch. All you have to do is feel the tingle of the T.L.C. Framboos Glycolic Night Serum to know that that stuff is working.So I was eager to take the D-Bronzi\u2122 Anti-Pollution Sunshine Drops, which launched this summer, out for a test drive. (Plus, I need to troubleshoot my dark olive skin, which in the winter turns so sallow that I look like I\u2019m one Bloody Mary away from jaundice.) If you can get over the name \u201cD-Bronzi\u2122 Anti-Pollution Sunshine Drops,\u201d which took me a week because I knew I would have to type it multiple times, you then have to go through the work of trying to understand what, exactly, this is. Is it self-tanner? Antioxidant serum? Bronzer? All of the above?Technically, it\u2019s a bronzing serum, which means that it has the deep, nutty color of a serious bronzer paired with, yes, an antioxidant serum. There are also hydrating fatty acids and peptides in the formula, which are beneficial for all skin types. But, even so, the anti-pollution benefits touted in the name seem like more of an afterthought. (It\u2019s a nice afterthought! But it\u2019s still an afterthought.) That\u2019s partly because the pigment is so concentrated that it looks and acts far more like a makeup product than skincare.Masterson says you can mix the D-Bronzi\u2122 Anti-Pollution Sunshine Drops (ugh) with a number of things, like other serums, oil, sunscreen, or moisturizer. I first mix it with my moisturizer, and am immediately impressed by how sheer and subtle the glow-enhancing effect is, as though I spent a three-day weekend on an alpine hike. It also gives my skin a dewy finish, which I\u2019m very into\u2014until I remember that I still have to put on sunscreen. The SPF blurs out most of the sun-kissed color, and I\u2019m back to square one.The next day, I mix it with my sunscreen. I usually wear sunscreen that\u2019s fairly liquid in texture, meaning it blends in easily and never looks chalky. But the sunscreen and bronzing serum together make me look a little too dewy, like I ate a Whopper Junior with cheese late last night and now, in the early light of dawn, all of the grease is finally emerging from my pores. And I already have oily skin! No, thank you.Finally, I go off-label and combine it with my foundation. (It\u2019s IT Cosmetics Your Skin But Better CC+ Cream Oil-Free Matte with SPF 40, in case you too emit more grease than a drive-thru window.) The matte, oil-free foundation blends seamlessly with half a pump of the D-Bronzi\u2122 Anti-Pollution Sunshine Drops. The resulting mixture gives me everything I want: glowing skin, a fresh finish, and just enough coverage to trick people into complimenting my skin. And protection against pollution, I guess.I really like the D-Bronzi\u2122 Anti-Pollution Sunshine Drops now that I\u2019ve figured out how to pair it. It\u2019ll take some experimenting for you, too, since everyone\u2019s routines and skin types vary.
