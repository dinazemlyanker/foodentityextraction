I\u2019ve made a lot of disappointing chia puddings in the past. This one is incredible, both flavor and texture. It tastes even better with the yogurt, I will be making this regularly. I did reduce the amount of dates, salt, and maple syrup in the yogurt. AnonymousNew York1/2/2022Fabulous for a dessert or brunch. I first followed recipe as is and was far too salty. I then used 1/3 the salt and it was perfect. I had only black chia seeds and it was fine. A big hit for all!  SallyLos Angeles9/11/2021Thank you so much!  it was delicious.  I'll make this over and over. SoosChesterfield, MO8/8/2021The kind of dessert you can eat every night of the week and not feel too bad about indulgingAnonymous10/7/2020LOVE this recipe. The combo with yogurt is SO GOOD. The only thing i'd change is, making this half recipe. I live alone and could not finish the whole recipe in 4-5 days. AnonymousSan Francisco8/24/2020I will make this pudding again today but with less salt. Otherwise - tasty and rich flavor, but totally agree that salt should be reduced. I made it without yogurt, just the chocolaty part. Nice and rich morning treat.lolitapuLatvia, Riga8/3/2020I will make this pudding again today but with less salt. Otherwise - tasty and rich flavor, but totally agree that salt should be reduced. I made it without yogurt, just the chocolaty part. Nice and rich morning treat.Anonymous8/3/2020I made this today, it is delicious but I will cut back on the salt next time it is a little too strong. Quite easy to make and will last me a few days.AnonymousLondon5/24/2020This is good! The pudding on its own is a nice, but mixing it with the yogurt, maple syrup, and flakey salt really takes it to the next level. I held back on the salt and think that was the right decision; I find it plenty sweet-salty with just 1/2 tsp. I used black chia seeds and don't think it had any negative effect.AnonymousNew York2/27/2020I\u2019ve seen a few people talking about overly-salty pudding. I was worried about this, too. I bought unsalted cashews and I think that helped? Overall I really enjoyed this recipe. I\u2019ve never had dates before but it turns out I like them! I\u2019m trying to find healthier alternatives to sweets, this is one I will definitely make again. AnonymousRhode Island1/13/2020This chia pudding portion is too salty. I love Molly\u2019s recipes but this one was very weird when it came to salt to sweet ratio. I added honey after the fact and it still didn\u2019t cut the saltiness. Cut your salt on it, add a little at a time! AnonymousIrvine, Ca1/7/2020This pudding was dank! Super delicious but not over-indulgent.airusk12/9/2019I love this recipe, made it for my friendsgiving potluck.Anonymous12/9/2019LOVED THIS. It felt sweet, indulgent, filling, but not overly heavy or cloying. I made my own cashew milk to start, then blended everything together. Those who had trouble with crunchy pudding: Blend your chia seeds into the rest and add a little extra milk. I personally didn't but I love chia pudding. AnonymousBellingham, WA10/14/2019My white chia seeds did not soften. Pudding should not be crunchy. Very disappointing. Should I have heated milk? Anyone else have this problem. Upset I had to throw it out. Salt was not a issue.AnonymousBraintree Ma10/2/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titPuddingDessertChiaSeedCashewNutCocoaOther IngredientsYogurtDairy-FreeGluten-FreeVeganHealthyishRecipes you want to make.
