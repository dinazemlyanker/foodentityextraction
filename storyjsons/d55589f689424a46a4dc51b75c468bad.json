Mmm, I think, pouring myself a Meletti. That laksa was so good, but now I would like not to taste it anymore. A digestif marks the end of dinner in a way that is both celebratory and final, like an exclamation point. That was fun! Let\u2019s go to bed.Brightland\u2019s Digestif candle operates on the same principle, except for your nose instead of your taste buds. After the garlicky fried rice or pan-seared mackerel or cumin-forward aloo gobi has been cleared, light up this scented candle and, if you\u2019d like, pass the scotch. With notes of neroli (which is derived from bitter orange blossoms), vetiver (a fragrant grass), and a hint of black pepper, Digestif banishes food smells and transports you somewhere warm, verdant, and lush.Brightland Digestif Candle$42 at BrightlandIf you\u2019re thinking, Brightland? Isn\u2019t that the olive oil company with the Instagrammable matte bottle and the slick branding? you are correct. The secret ingredient in this soy-based candle\u2014and what makes its fragrance especially potent\u2014is Brightland\u2019s own cold-pressed California olive oil, which it says improves the \u201cscent throw\u201d of the candle. You know how when you bloom spices in ghee or oil, their flavor permeates the fat, which in turn infuses lentils or pasta or chicken breasts with redolent goodness? It\u2019s the same idea with the olive oil and the component scents in the Digestif candle. I\u2019m pretty sure. I\u2019m not a scientist. But that sounds right.Even on nights when I\u2019m not lingering at the table with guests after dinner, the Digestif candle has become part of my routine. I\u2019ll light it up while I\u2019m washing dishes\u2014the equivalent of brushing my kitchen\u2019s teeth before bed\u2014knowing that when I stumble downstairs the next morning, it\u2019ll smell like a boutique filled with lovely things I can\u2019t afford instead of last night\u2019s fish.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make.
