I too bought tickets weeks ahead of my trip to witness the experiential installations by an artist who famously dragged 12 icebergs from Greenland to Paris as a statement about climate change. While there, I waded through a room thick with fog that rendered me color-blind and a kaleidoscope-like tunnel that seemed to compress and contour the space around me. At the very end of the show, however, I noticed a sign pointing to what turned out to be my favorite moment in the whole exhibition: lunch.The fog! (Possible inspo for carrot soup?)\nPHOTO BY ALLIE WISTDownstairs, at the Tate Modern\u2019s terrace bar, was a five-course tasting menu featuring funky local cider, rich and salty focaccia, a cumin-forward hummus, and more. Jon Atashroo, the head chef at Tate Modern, spent a week at Studio Olafur Eliasson (SOE) Kitchen in Berlin to develop a menu in response to Eliasson\u2019s research.

Butter, for example, is replaced by homemade labneh, and local rapeseed oil is used in place of imported olive oil. Each dish is annotated with its carbon footprint. A velvety carrot soup topped with a preserved-lemon-and-almond crunch: 257 g CO2e. A smoky, sweet red pepper dip: 45 g CO2e. A courgette (a.k.a. zucchini) salad with sour grapefruit, mint leaves, and nuts: 38 g CO2e. The dishes were sustainable, and yet still indulgent, bright and unexpected\u2014not unlike some of the artist\u2019s installations themselves.Talking about climate change can be bleak and, at its worse, preachy. But at the Tate Modern, that conversation is neither of those things. Instead, it\u2019s delicious.Go there: Studio Olafur Eliasson Kitchen at the Tate ModernExplore Bon App\u00e9titLondonHighly RecommendRead MorecookingWe Went on a Field TripBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
