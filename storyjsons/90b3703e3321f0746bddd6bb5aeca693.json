Pro tip: If you sign up for the Healthyish newsletter, you\u2019ll get the scoop before everyone else.I\u2019ve never been much of a fruit person. I always keep frozen bananas and berries in the freezer for smoothies, but in the realm of fleeting seasonal produce, I\u2019ve always picked ramps over rhubarb (okay fine, not a fruit), corn over plums.Fruits often require forethought and patience\u2014two things I lack in general, but especially in the kitchen. You don\u2019t buy avocados the day you plan to make a batch of party-size guac, and you don\u2019t buy peaches the day you plan on pie. My problem is that I want to make pie RIGHT NOW. And in three days\u2019 time when those peaches are perfectly ripe, I\u2019ll want to make...something else (probably guac). Or I\u2019ll be busy living my life because my plans are finally unpredictable and spontaneous again, two words that I\u2019ve had to redact from my vocabulary for 1.5 years! I cannot afford to bend my newfound social plans for PEACHES!!!!The thing is, fruit, like sourdough starter, lets you know when it is ready for you, not the other way around. I learned this last week when I bought several pounds of gorgeous-but-slightly-too-firm apricots to turn into a brioche tart. But in my haste to bake the tart in time for a party (a party!), one thing led to another: I used the unripe fruit, didn\u2019t let my dough fully proof, and ended up with something flat, dense, and, yes, technically tart (but not the tart I was seeking.) It didn\u2019t make it to the party.I had all but forgotten about the remaining apricots until two days ago, when I noticed they had finally, perfectly ripened, blushing in their bowl and giving slightly when I gently pressed into them with my thumb. I didn\u2019t have a plan for them, but there they were, just the same, calling: We\u2019re ready for you! In the spirit of slowing down and making room for the unexpected, I took an hour out of my afternoon to bake them into this sublime custard cake (I subbed halved apricots for the rhubarb.) The fruit sunk into the batter and slowly baked into jammy, vibrantly orange pockets while the cake\u2019s edges turned both crunchy and chewy, almost mochi-like, with a sugar-flecked crust. And lest you were thinking this cake was all dressed up with nowhere to go, I did, in fact, bring it to a tiny dinner party. And days later, we\u2019re all still talking about how good it all was\u2014the cake, but also the company.Spring bakes:Photo by Alex LauRhubarb Custard CakeOne-Hour Apricot and Almond GaletteStrawberry Snacking CakeRhubarb Brown Butter BarsBA's Best Strawberry-Rhubarb PieBasically Strawberry ShortcakesExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishWhat's Chaey Cooking?SpringessayRecipes you want to make.
