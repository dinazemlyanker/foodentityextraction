They are also great topped with a fried egg, or with roasted vegetables instead of chorizo to make this a plant-based breakfast.\u201dIngredients4 Servings5Tbsp. vegetable oil, divided8corn tortillas12oz. fresh chorizo3garlic cloves, crushed\u00bdmedium white onion, thinly sliced, plus more for servingKosher salt215-oz. cans black beans, rinsed, or 3 cups Frijoles de la Olla, drained1\u00bdcups low-sodium chicken broth6oz. queso fresco or Cotija cheese, crumbledCilantro leaves with tender stems and sliced avocado (for serving)PreparationStep 1Using 2 Tbsp. oil, brush both sides of each tortilla. Heat a large skillet over medium-high. Working in batches, cook until lightly browned and starting to crisp, about 1 minute per side. Set aside.Step 2Heat remaining 3 Tbsp. oil in same skillet over medium-high. Cook chorizo, breaking up with a wooden spoon, until browned and cooked through, 7\u20139 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a medium bowl; set aside.Step 3Add garlic and \u00bd onion to same skillet, season with salt, and cook, tossing occasionally, until tender and beginning to brown, 6\u20138 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer garlic mixture to a blender; reserve pan with oil. Add beans and broth to blender and pur\u00e9e until smooth (it should be the consistency of yogurt); season with salt.Step 4Set reserved pan over medium-high and heat oil. Transfer bean pur\u00e9e to skillet and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low. Working one at a time and using tongs, dip tortillas in bean pur\u00e9e, turning to coat and leaving until softened, about 3 seconds per side (they will soften more as they sit). Transfer to a baking sheet as you go. Spoon 1 Tbsp. chorizo and 1 Tbsp. queso fresco across the center of each tortilla; fold over like a taco.Step 5Divide among plates and spoon remaining bean pur\u00e9e over. Top with cilantro, avocado, more onion, remaining chorizo, and remaining queso.How would you rate Enfrijoladas?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (7)Back to TopTriangleMade this with leftover black beans (Cuban-style \u2014 sorry!) and leftover roasted vegetables (as suggested), instead of the chorizo. The tortilla technique is foolproof \u2014 so much simpler than trying to pass them through shallow oil. An easy and indulgent brunch with a fried egg. Thank you, Rick!Dan TBoston, MA12/29/2020I made these enfrijoladas exactly like the recipe.  They were fantastic.  A friend told me they were exactly like he had had them in Mexico City 40 years go.  Another friend told me to invite him whenever I made them.barbara6207San Diego9/24/2020This recipe was so good! I used canned beans but def will be using his bean recipe next time for better color and flavor. Also used soyrizo from trader joes and it was delicious! AnonymousLos Angeles 9/16/2020These were great! A good way to mix up having plain old tacos :) I just wish my grocery store had better chorizo :(Anonymous9/15/2020We went meat-free dinner on this one! Was quick, easy, and very tasty. We're planning on incorporating it into our meal-planning lineup! AnonymousOxford, MS9/12/2020This was a huge win for me! I've dedicated my whole week of cooking to Rick's recipes from this issue and so far this has been my favorite. Definitely worth making the frijoles de la olla to use for this recipe. Makes a fabulous savory brunch! AnonymousPhiladelphia, PA9/9/2020Deeply savory and so dang delicious.
