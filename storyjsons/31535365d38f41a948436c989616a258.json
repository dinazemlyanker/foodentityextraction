Each of the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen editors will be sharing their top 10 cooking rules: the techniques they swear by, the ingredients they can\u2019t live without, and the mindsets that keep them going. This week: our one and only food director, queen of the Test Kitchen, and lover of all things saucy glossy, Carla Lalli Music.1. Embrace fat.Fat is integral to any dish, and not just because it adds flavor. Fat is also a cooking medium\u2014think about the olive oil you swirl into a pan before saut\u00e9ing, or the deep bath of peanut oil you\u2019d add to a cast-iron skillet to fry some chicken. Heat moves through fat into the ingredient you\u2019re cooking, connecting the cooking equipment to the food itself, and if you don\u2019t have enough of it, your food may char instead of sizzling and browning.2. Zone out your fridge.Messy bed, messy head\u2014but for the kitchen. I am a big believer in zoning out my fridge in the same way I organize my closet. You can\u2019t just shove everything in there and expect to be able to find what you\u2019re looking for. I learned this rule in restaurants, where it\u2019s super important to be able to locate what you need quickly. Keep dairy in one area, condiments in another. I have a half shelf dedicated to leftovers, and another spot that is for cheese, deli meats, and charcuterie only. I even keep fruit in one crisper drawer (citrus, apples, grapes), and vegetables in the other (lettuces, cucumbers, herbs, etc.). That way, if you can\u2019t find something in the area where it belongs, you don\u2019t have to rummage all around. You probably don\u2019t have it.3. Set your oven up for success.I wrote this one for myself, since I need to be reminded. Rick Martinez taught me these rules, and I think about them everytime I behold my kinda-crusty oven interior: A clean oven conducts heat much more evenly and efficiently than a dirty one. My oven isn\u2019t clean. Maybe that\u2019s why it runs 50 degrees cooler than the temperature on the dial.4. Buy a black steel pan.Black carbon steel pans are as effective as conducting and retaining heat as cast-iron, but without the bulk and weight. They\u2019re often sold as \u201ccrepe pans,\u201d but come in lots of diameters. I use a 9 \u00bd-inch one made by Matfer Bourgeat\u2014affordable and indestructible. It\u2019s my go-to for searing scallops or steaks, making grilled cheese, and yes, crepes!Buy it: Matfer Bourgeat 9 1/2-inch Black Carbon Steel Frying Pan, $36 on AmazonToo much fun in the bulk bin.\n5. Have a favorite dish? Cook it forever.Think of this like your favorite jeans. Why buy other jeans when those ones are the best? If something is working, work it.6. Shop first, decide what to make second.I talk about this rule a lot in my book, Where Cooking Begins. If you go to the market with a very specific recipe and list of ingredients in mind, you can set yourself up for disappointment. What if they don\u2019t have what you needed? What if the salmon you thought you were making doesn\u2019t look so hot? Instead, stock your kitchen with basics (and I\u2019d argue you should order those online), such as oils, vinegars, nuts, dairy, condiments, grains, pasta, canned beans, and tomatoes. When you shop in person, go rogue! Look for peak-season produce, the clear-eyed fishes, and the most marbled meats. You\u2019ll end up coming home with the best ingredients the store had to offer, and can search for the right recipe once your purchase is in hand.7. Shop the bulk bin, but don\u2019t do big-batch cooking.I love love LOVE the bulk bin, where I buy dried beans, grains, seeds, and dried fruit for less per pound than the pre-packaged brands. But I don\u2019t cook in big batches anymore, preferring to spend my weekend actually hanging out with the people I love instead of making meals for the freezer.Knives are extensions of your hands in the kitchen. So find the right one for you.\nPhoto by Alex Lau8. Always buy knives in person.You can buy a lot of things online to no ill effect, but a knife is something you should hold in your hand before you throw down your credit card. The weight of the handle, the length of the blade, the shape and style of the knife itself\u2014you need to touch it to know if it feels right for you. I have small hands, and I love my 5-inch utility knife. But a person with big paws might feel like they were playing around with a nail file.9. Don\u2019t cook with headphones on (but definitely get into podcasts).Cooking is a full-sensory experience. I have a galley kitchen, and when I\u2019m at my cutting board or sink, my back is often turned to the stove. If you can\u2019t hear, you\u2019ll miss the rattle when a pot of water comes to a boil, or when the juicy sounds of an onion softening in butter turns into the rough scratchy sound of that same onion burning to a crisp. The time to put the earpods in? When you\u2019re washing up.10. Stop relying on recipes.Recipes are great and everything, don\u2019t get me wrong. But all the looking back and forth between the recipe and the stove, the precise measurements of this and that when a little pinch or a palmful will do\u2026 That specificity and exactness can sometimes get in the way of paying attention to what\u2019s happening in the pan and tasting your food while you go.
