But this (vegetarian! dairy-free!) matzo ball soup is more than a starter (and might enter your rotation all year round). Instead of relying on store-bought vegetable broth, which can be hit or miss, the flavor foundation comes from cooked-down cabbage. Be patient\u2014you want the cabbage to caramelize not burn, and the lower and slower you go, the greater your reward. We recommend heating only as many cooked matzo balls in the soup as you\u2019re going to eat and storing the leftover balls separately. Otherwise, they may get waterlogged and fall apart.Ingredients6\u20138 servings4large eggs, beaten to blend\u00bdcup extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more for serving\u00bccup finely chopped chives, plus more for serving2\u00bdtsp. Diamond Crystal or 1\u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt, divided, plus more2\u00bdtsp. freshly ground black pepper, divided, plus more1cup (120 g) matzo meal1small savoy or green cabbage (about 2 lb.), thinly sliced1medium onion, thinly sliced4garlic cloves, crushed2large leeks (about 1 lb.), white and pale green parts only, thinly sliced8oz. peanut or other very small potatoes, halved\u00bdcup (packed) coarsely chopped parsley, plus more for serving1\u20132tsp. fresh lemon juicePreparationStep 1Whisk eggs, \u00bc cup oil, \u00bc cup chives, 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt, 1 tsp. pepper, and \u00bc cup water in a medium bowl to combine. Add matzo meal and mix until no dry spots remain. Mixture will be loose. Cover and chill at least 30 minutes and up to 3 hours.Step 2Heat \u00bc cup oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Add cabbage, onion, garlic, and 1\u00bd tsp. pepper and cook, tossing (tongs help here!) until coated in oil and starting to wilt. Reduce heat to low, cover pot, and cook, stirring every 10\u201315 minutes, until cabbage is dark and starting to stick to pot, 45\u201360 minutes. (If cabbage is starting to stick too much before it\u2019s done, add 1\u20132 Tbsp. water and scrape up brown bits stuck to bottom of pot.) Scoop out about \u00bd cup cabbage and set aside.Step 3Meanwhile, working with damp hands, divide matzo mixture into 20 pieces and roll each into about a \u00bd\"-diameter ball. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Gently drop in matzo balls and reduce heat so water is at a simmer. Cover pot and cook until matzo balls puff, rise to the surface, and are tender throughout (cut one open to check), 15\u201320 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a large plate or rimmed baking sheet.Step 4Mix leeks, potatoes, and 1\u00bd tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt into cabbage mixture and add 6 cups water. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer gently, adding any matzo balls you will be eating in the final 5 minutes, until potatoes are tender, 10\u201312 minutes. (Any matzo balls that you\u2019re not serving should be stored and reheated separately.) Remove from heat and stir in \u00bd cup parsley and 1 tsp. lemon juice. Taste soup and season with more salt and add remaining 1 tsp. lemon juice if needed.Step 5Ladle soup into bowls, then top with more chives and parsley and reserved cabbage. Season with pepper and drizzle with a little oil.Do ahead: Matzo balls can be cooked in water 5 days ahead. Cover and chill. Reheat in soup just before serving.How would you rate Vegetarian Matzo Ball Soup With Caramelized Cabbage?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (6)Back to TopTriangleThis was easy to make and had beautiful flavor. Please note: caramelizing the cabbage takes a LONG time. It took me 2.5 hours just to get the cabbage to that perfect brown color. It\u2019s not difficult, but it does take up a lot of time. My recommendations are to make this when you have a day off and to start earlier in the day. Do not quit before the cabbage caramelizes or you will lose out on all of the flavor. J GagePhiladelphia10/28/2021Delicious. Could maybe use another clove of garlic butter nice balance of vegetables don\u2019t leave out the lemon juice. I didn\u2019t make the matzoh balls and it was still tasty I use some meatless meatballs by GardineMary9/21/2021Reeeeally not worth the effort. It took a really long time to make a soup that wasn't that great. I would've rather used a packet and just added some veggies.... Would've tasted better, been cheaper, and significantly quicker. I'm not against recipes that take hours, but they need to be worth the effortAnonymous8/7/2021Wow! This is seriously delicious. I chopped my veg then stirred cabbage for an hour while half paying attention to a work phone call hahha - it worked perfectly! It does take time to get the caramelization but wow it's a flavor bomb! Made exactly as-is only addition was I added a carrot cause I had it, went really well though. This is incredible and makes a really good amount of soup. Psyched for leftovers!kmarxmarxchicago, il4/21/2021The soup has no flavour! It also took hours to make and you can\u2019t even tell that the cabbage is caeamilized! I would not do this recipe again. Also this was supposed to be 0-1 star but the website only let me have 5 stars. Izzy LCanada \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 4/18/2021Made this for my Jewish vegetarian wife this passover. It was my first attempt at Matzo balls. They came out great! The soup truly does not \"miss the chicken\". It can take a long time to achieve good caramelization on the cabbage. I cooked it on quite a low temperature to avoid burning. I could have added more water but chose some veggie stock to make it a bit soupier. \nThe Matzo balls came out great! They will expand quite a bit. I made half the recipe (soup and Matzo balls) and it fed 2 of us for 2 meals.
