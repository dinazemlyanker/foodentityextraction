Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you\u2019ll get the scoop before everyone else.Dear Healthyish friends,Although my normal diet is largely pescatarian, I go through phases a few times a year when, out of nowhere, I develop an overwhelming Flintstonian craving for red meat. When this happens, I typically splurge on a steak or pork chop from a good butcher shop, make myself a medium-rare dinner, and put my carnivorous cravings to bed for the next month or two.I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the recent chilly spell in New York or the fact that I\u2019m not going out to restaurants (where I tend to do most of my meat-eating) right now, but recently my urges have gone into overdrive. You can only make so many pots of beans and grains and braised greens before you want to give them a little boost in the form of a little bacon or a crumbling of sausage, something to make you forget that this is the 27th pot of beans you\u2019ve cooked for yourself in quarantine. (Or is that just me? Also, no shade to beans. It\u2019s just that between my roommate\u2019s Rancho Gordo bean club subscription and my own beany whims, our pantry is positively drowning in legumes.) And, as I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to tell you, willing yourself to eat tofu when what you really desire is skirt steak simply...does not work.I\u2019m using little bits of La Quercia\u2019s pancetta all winter long to flavor soups, greens, and more\nChristina ChaeySo many of my favorite cookbooks (Made in India by Meera Sodha, Every Grain of Rice by Fuschia Dunlop, Six Seasons by Joshua McFadden) espouse a style of cooking and eating that puts vegetables front and center with a bit of meat or fish used almost like a seasoning, the idea being you don\u2019t need much meat to truly satisfy your stomach. Revisiting them recently, I\u2019ve been inspired to start accumulating a small collection of meat products to cook with over the next few months. I\u2019ve frozen a couple of packages of chuck for stews (heavy on the carrots, turnips, and potatoes, please) and a half-rack of pork ribs to flavor a future pot of posole. And after revisiting one of my favorite vegetarian-ish cookbooks (and past BA Cookbook Club pick) Almonds, Anchovies, and Pancetta by Cal Peternell, I impulse-ordered a huge hunk of La Quercia pancetta. That beauty is currently sitting in my fridge, where it\u2019ll keep for weeks as I cut off little hunks of it to season greens, pastas, soups, etc. I\u2019m definitely saving some to make crispy lardons for this Lyonnaise salad, and yes, I will be saving the drippings left in the skillet\u2014how else will I make chef Anthony Salguero\u2019s Salvadoran Super-Refried Beans from our October issue?Have a just-meaty-enough winter,Christina ChaeyAssociate editorUse a li\u2019l meat:Greens with Braised Pancetta and GarlicThis satisfying veg-forward dish proves that sometimes the role for meat is as a supporting actor helping to make green things shine.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titWhat's Chaey Cooking?HealthyishMeatVegetableVegetarianessayRead MorecultureI Never Loved Oatmeal Until I Started Making It Like ThisBy Christina ChaeyLifestyleThe Summer Drink I\u2019m Bringing Into FallBy Christina ChaeyRecipes you want to make.
