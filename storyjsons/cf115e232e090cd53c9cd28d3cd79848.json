Mastermind behind the account and namesake business is owner and principal designer Jennifer Jones, whose signature style seamlessly blends restrained elegance, family-friendly playfulness, and an unwavering commitment to sustainability. In addition to running San Francisco\u2013based Niche Interiors since 2007, she\u2019s a LEED-accredited professional, ambassador for the Sustainable Furnishing Council, and a founding member of the Good Future Design Alliance. Here Jones shares five kitchen design ideas for building a sustainable (and chic) space.Photography by Paul Dyer1. Start With Safer Storage\u201cSustainable design,\u201d Jones explains, \u201cis not just about how your choices affect the environment; it\u2019s about creating healthy homes.\u201d In the kitchen that starts with storage. \u201cCabinetry can be the biggest offender in terms of off-gassing,\u201d she says, referring to the noxious chemicals released by the materials in many furnishings. She suggests using timber that is free of urea-formaldehyde (a toxic resin) and labeled as FSC-certified, like the ApplePly birch used for this Aptos, California, home.Photograph by Paul Dyer2. Make a (Subtle) Splash\u201cBe careful with color in the kitchen,\u201d Jones says. \u201cPeople\u2019s tastes change.\u201d Rather than commit to cabinets or appliances in trendy hues that come and go, she delivers color in smaller doses\u2014like the backsplash tile in this Sonoma kitchen. Choose brands that are committed to recycling waste, such as Heath Ceramics. Looking for a low-stakes color fix? Start here.Photography by Paul Dyer3. Think Long-Term\u201cReplacing countertops is one of the worst things for the environment,\u201d Jones says. For clients who fret over stains, she suggests resilient solid surfaces like Cambria, Silestone, and Caesarstone. \u201cKnow your limits and pick something that will last years.\u201d Still, that doesn\u2019t mean shunning marble altogether. In this Bay Area kitchen, statuary slabs clad just the backsplashes.Photograph by R. Brad Knipstein4. Breathe EasyJones tends to favor induction cooktops, which have the least impact on air quality. But for clients who insist on gas, a powerful vent (like the Wolf hood in this Napa kitchen) helps minimize the effect of any CO\u2082 emissions\u2014no matter what it is you\u2019re cooking. \u201cAnytime you light your stove, use the vent.\u201d Not ready to go all in on induction?

Make Simple SwapsZero-VocCourtesy of Benjamin MooreChestertown Buff Zero-Voc Paint\u201cThere\u2019s no excuse not to use it,\u201d Jones says of paint made without harmful chemicals known as volatile organic compounds.
