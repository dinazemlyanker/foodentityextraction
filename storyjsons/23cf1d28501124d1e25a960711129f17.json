The open-concept space serves lattes and espressos and a variety of milks (oat, almond, macadamia) and plenty of \u201cwellness\u201d options (Kava tea, Bulletproof-style coffee, activated charcoal add-ins). But there\u2019s one totally unique item: Cannabidiol-infused (CBD) coffee.Although CBD\u2014the non-psychoactive cannabinoid compound found in marijuana and hemp plants\u2014won\u2019t get you \u201chigh,\u201d it does promote relaxation. A 2016 pediatric study from researchers at the University of Colorado School of Medicine found that \u201cCBD oil can be an effective compound to reduce anxiety and insomnia.\u201dThe coffee creation is the brainchild of chef Leighton Knowles, co-founder of the New York- and Ohio-based company, Flower Power Coffee Company. The beans are purchased from 70-year-old coffee purveyor D\u2019Amico Coffee Roasters, a family-owned shop Brooklyn. Rather than dropping CBD oil into a drink, Flower Power\u2019s formula is infused into ground beans before they\u2019re brewed. Flower Power co-founder and Brooklyn pharmacist, Craig Leivent, says that the few other CBD-infused coffees on the market coat the whole bean with oil, which, he says, doesn\u2019t provide a consistent measurement of CBD per cup. \u201cWhen you drink our coffee,\u201d says Leivent, who has a doctorate in pharmacology and an undergraduate degree in botany, \u201cyou get the alertness from the caffeine but without the jitters.\u201dFlower Power's CBD coffee beans.\nMarijuana is recreationally legal in nine states (and D.C.), but technically, CBD is legal in 43 states\u2014as long as it has been derived from hemp, which contains very few traces of THC. But this also means a potentially less potent product. A 2015 study out of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel, found that whole-plant CBD is superior to hemp-derived CBD for the treatment of inflammatory and anxiety conditions. Flower Power\u2019s CBD coffee is derived from hemp and double-tested in a lab in Massachusetts to makes sure it\u2019s THC-free. Leivent says that if he lived and worked in a state where marijuana were recreationally legal, he\u2019d get whole-plant CBD rather than the hemp-derived stuff. \u201cCBD from whole-plant marijuana has other chemicals in it, minute cannabinoids that work synergistically with the body to create an entourage effect,\u201d says Leivent. \u201cYou get more of a medical effect with all of these chemicals working together rather than just one particular [hemp-based] isolate.\"CBD oil derived from whole-plant marijuana has seen promising results for numerous medical treatments, including treating children with epilepsy. (In 2013, CNN\u2019s Dr. Sanjay Gupta introduced the world to a child who after using CBD oil went from having 300 seizures a month to only two.) On April 19, the AP reported that an FDA panel is reviewing a a pharmaceutical-grade CBD oil made from whole-plant marijuana called Epidiolex, a possible treatment for rare forms of pediatric epilepsy. If approved, it would be the first marijuana-made medication sold on the U.S. market. A day later, on the marijuana community\u2019s \u201chigh holiday,\u201d April 20, New York Senator Chuck Schumer introduced legislation to decriminalize marijuana on the federal level. Forecasters are predicting that legal cannabis in the U.S. will be outselling soda by 2030.Due to its anti-inflammatory properties, CBD oil has recently become a wellness-world darling, popping up in everything from mascara to bath bombs. But the science hasn\u2019t caught up to the supply. A 2017 University of Pennsylvania study found \u201ca lack of regulation and oversight\u201d on cannabidiol extracts, and that 70 percent of CBD products sold online were mislabeled. So like many other products we consume or put on our skin daily (makeup, lotions, supplements, vitamins) none of it is regulated. If you live in a state where marijuana is not recreationally legal, your CBD will most likely be derived from hemp. And that\u2019s okay, says Leivent. \u201cHemp-based CBD still works on the  same issues like anxiety and anti-inflammatory conditions, there are just fewer amounts of the other chemicals that could enhance the effect of the CBD.\"Hemp-derived CBD definitely had an effect on me. At Caffeine Underground, I ordered a CBD oat milk latte\u2014smooth and delicious with no trace of CBD flavor\u2014and toast made with CBD-infused jam. After two hours plugging away on my laptop with full concentration, I was still so completely blissed out, the walk back to the train in 30-degree weather felt like it took no time at all.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishCoffeeMarijuanaCannabisTrendsRead MoreshoppingThis CBD Tincture Makes Me Super Productive\u2026 In a Chill WayBy Martine ThompsonRecipes you want to make.
