It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Something to cookI made BA\u2019s Best Banana Bread last weekend and it lived up to its name. I only had three overripe bananas, swapped \u00bc cup of AP flour with almond flour for fun, and made it into muffins (so cut the cook time in half). They turned out so moist and banana-y! Would make again!Get the recipe: BA\u2019s Best Banana BreadA look that says \u201cwhat have you done with that frosting sir\u201dGourmet Makes star Claire Saffitz was on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon this week, decorating a layer cake and attempting to teach Jimmy Fallon how to do the same. My takeaway: Claire is so patient and charming, just like real life! I need a spin-y cake stand!

Sign up for our newsletter!In a noodle moodHappy Year of the Rat! When Lisa Cheng Smith was in the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen making the recipes for this Lunar New Year menu, I went back for bowl after bowl of the scallion-oil noodles. The scallion flavor is so deep and caramelized\u2014nothing like that sharpness you get when they\u2019re sliced raw and on top of stuff\u2014because they\u2019re saut\u00e9ed in oil for nearly 30 minutes!!!Get the recipe: Scallion-Oil NoodlesAnd on the occasion of the Lunar New Year, BA contributor MacKenzie Fegan wrote a great piece for the San Francisco Chronicle about her family\u2019s Chinese restaurants in the area, Henry\u2019s Hunan. It\u2019s a story about the country\u2019s first Chinese restaurants, the struggles of sustaining family-run businesses, and the physical toll that restaurant work requires of the human body. I loved this quote from Meng Tao, MacKenzie\u2019s mother\u2019s half-sister, who still shows up to wash dishes when needed: \u201cI don\u2019t care about my clothes. I don\u2019t care about mahjong,\u201d she told MacKenzie, \u201cI just like to eat.\u201dRead it: Three Generations At Work in Henry\u2019s Hunan Restaurants in San FranciscoOh no no noNo no no noooooooThis newsletter was filed...very lateBecause I was watching the Mario Buatta auction LIVE all day Thursday. The interior decorator, who died in 2018, had such a vast and quirky collection of...things...by the time the Sotheby\u2019s auction had been running for four hours, we were only on Lot 192...of 969. Items were going for tens of thousands of dollars. My eyes were on: oil portraits of moody cocker spaniels (want), velvet upholstered footstools (need), and beautiful Delft blue and white porcelain (never enough). When it got to the TROVE of asparagus and cabbage decor, I realized I should maybe write about it to share my wonder and delight with you. Above, an asparagus-shaped tureen ended up selling for $25,000. 25,000!!!!Courtesy of Frito-LayPudding...chips?Have you scanned the chip aisle lately and thought: \u201cToo many flavors!\u201d? It\u2019s true! There are too many! The first flavors of potato chips were barbecue, onion, and salt & vinegar. But two weeks ago we got a delivery of Flamin\u2019 Hot Lim\u00f3n Doritos (not into those) and jalape\u00f1o-cheddar Lay\u2019s (very into those). The Guardian has a nerdy-fascinating article about the rise of high-concept chip flavors, I mean flavours, especially those very UK-centric ones, like Christmas pudding and \u201cwhisky and Haggis,\u201d which, oof.Photo by Transcendental Graphics/Getty ImagesPR stunt of the weekMr. Peanut had to \u201cdie\u201d in order to direct your attention towards a salty tin of peanuts this Super Bowl season. The mascot, despite having the top hat and monocle of a 19th century oil baron, was never able to afford a pair of pants.
