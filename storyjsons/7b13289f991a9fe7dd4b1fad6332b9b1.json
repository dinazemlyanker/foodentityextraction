Kalman depicts a pink cake in Rome, a sweet remedy for heartbreak, and the honey cake her Israeli cousin bakes for her visits. \u201cI\u2019m always going back to New York with a suitcase full of cake,\u201d she says, \u201cwhich I distribute like a miser to family.\u201d Not all souvenirs are for sharing.Read more: 17 New Spring Cookbooks We Can\u2019t Wait to StainThen make a cake:Explore Bon App\u00e9titCookbooksCakeRead Moreculture17 New Spring Cookbooks We Can\u2019t Wait to StainBy Christine MuhlkeRecipes you want to make.
