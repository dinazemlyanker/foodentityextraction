Tangy, smoky, and just a touch spicy, my simple version\u2014made with charred tomatoes, jalapen\u0303os, garlic, and salt\u2014is an example of how just a few ingredients can transform into something truly spectacular. Everyone has their own twist; salsas like this are about having fun and finding your own saz\u00f3n (flavor). If you want to up the spice level, try subbing serranos for the jalape\u00f1os. Just be sure you pick good tomatoes because that will determine the sweetness and acidity\u2014heirlooms work perfectly because of their meatiness.\u00a0Making this salsa in a molcajete gives it a truly traditional flare, but you can use a food processor to get the same delicious result. Put it on fried eggs for breakfast or spoon it over any dish that you think needs a little extra flavor boost. It will stay fresh for up to a week.\u00a0IngredientsMakes about 2 cups6small heirloom tomatoes (about 1\u00bd lb.), cored, halved\u00bdsmall onion, peeled, quartered3garlic cloves, peeled3small jalapen\u0303os, stems removedKosher saltPreparationStep 1Heat broiler. Place tomatoes, onion, garlic, and jalape\u00f1os in a roasting pan or on a large rimmed baking sheet and broil until charred on top, about 4 minutes. Remove from broiler and turn vegetables over. Broil until other sides are charred, about 5 minutes. (Watch the garlic carefully and remove earlier if needed.)Step 2Transfer vegetables to a molcajete and mash into a coarse pur\u00e9e; season salsa with salt.Recipe adapted from Oaxaca: Home Cooking From the Heart of Mexico by Bricia Lopez and Javier Cabral.

Not only is it traditional, but it tastes best that way due to the added smokey flavors. Gas couldn't do that even if it wanted to. You are probably not going to light up the charcoal grill just for this dish, but if you are cooking some protein already it's easy to grill the tomatoes, onions, peppers and even the garlic on the side (use a wire basket for the latter). Sometimes adding a splash of water is necessary to get the right consistency. Yum!Will TriggsSan Francisco11/18/2021I made this several months ago (it's in Bricia's cookbook!) and it was fantastic. Roasting the veggies really brought out so much flavor and I loved how simple it is.
