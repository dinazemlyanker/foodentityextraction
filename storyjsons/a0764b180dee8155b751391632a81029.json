And while the internet is full of recipes, only a handful of publications, including ours, are backed up by kitchens where recipes are tested, tried by not one but several trained chefs and professional cooks, and tweaked until they\u2019re ready to be shared with the world.Today we\u2019re introducing a paid recipe subscription on both Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious. Moving to a subscription model will help us sustain our business and hard-working staff in a fast-changing industry\u2014and allow us to keep bringing you recipes that live up to our own and our community\u2019s exacting standards. Your support gives us the opportunity to deliver not just recipes but trusted advice on cooking methods, reporting on industry leaders, and soup-to-nuts (pun intended!) primers on our favorite ingredients.Here\u2019s how it works: After viewing three recipes you\u2019ll be prompted to create a paid account. Subscribers will have unlimited access to our ever-expanding Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious recipe databases, plus the vast archive of Gourmet recipes that live on Epicurious. (We\u2019re at 50,000 recipes and counting!) All users will continue to have unlimited access to articles, videos, and newsletters. More details can be found on our subscription page and FAQ page.For almost seven decades we have sought to help readers become confident, creative cooks who are engaged in and excited by food. That\u2019s as true for us now as it was in 1956, when our magazine first landed on shelves. The world has changed a lot since then, but people are still discovering the joys of cooking, and it feels like we're only just getting started. Thanks to your support, the future looks brighter than ever\u2014filled with delicious meals and thoughtful stories that help us all make sense of our ever-evolving food world.With gratitude,Dawn Davis and the editors of Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
