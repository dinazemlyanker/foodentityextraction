Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,This week, for the Healthyish Guide to Being Alone, I wrote about going through what I think was Covid-19 on my own: what I did, what I didn't do, and what I'd do differently.I was hesitant to write about it because, first of all, I never got tested and can\u2019t be sure I had it (though the two doctors I talked to remotely said it was likely). Also, people\u2019s symptoms have varied so widely, I wasn\u2019t sure how relevant one person\u2019s experience could be. And I didn\u2019t want to claim to be an expert in viruses, medicine, or herbalism. I\u2019m just an editor at a food magazine who happened to get sick.But, as I wrote last week, at a time when panic seems to be the default reaction and so much is unknown, we need all the rational and supportive information we can get. There\u2019s been so much written about how to prevent infection and stop the spread, but the CDC\u2019s advice on what to do if you get sick is woefully basic: rest, hydrate, go to the hospital if you can\u2019t breathe. When I was feeling bad, I was desperate for advice. Doctors were difficult to reach, so instead I found myself scrolling Twitter, a virtual cesspool where the scariest, saddest, and most alarming cases float to the top. That was...not good for me.The most helpful guidance came my way through friends who sent thoughtful personal accounts, suggestions for home remedies, and, quite literally, soup. I relied on those resources when I was taking care of myself, and I decided to pass on their best advice in the hopes that you or someone you love will find it useful.Tomorrow at 3 p.m. ET, I\u2019ll be going live on Healthyish\u2019s Instagram with my friend and chef Camille Becerra,who had a similar bout with suspected Covid-19 around the same time. We\u2019ll talk about the immune-supporting foods we\u2019ve been leaning on, the importance of rest, and how to stay calm (or at least calmish) even if you\u2019re not feeling well.Come with your questions, and we\u2019ll see you tomorrow.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish editorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletterCoronavirusessayRead MorecultureWhat I Wish I Did: A Guide to Getting Through Covid-19 AloneBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
