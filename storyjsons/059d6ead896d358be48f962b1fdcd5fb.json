What scary food is hiding under your bed this month?By Catherine UrbanOctober 1, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailIllustrations by Jay Daniel WrightFacebookTwitterEmailWe\u2019ve made it to the spookiest month of the year, in more ways than one. Whether you\u2019re scared of accidentally eating candy corn you mistook for actual corn (it happens\u2014wait, does it?) or a taco full of cilantro, there\u2019s something edible and terrifying for everyone. We really made a list. So what ghoulish food is in store for your sign in this October horoscope? Find out below.Illustration by Jay Daniel WrightAriesYou\u2019re a speed-walker who\u2019s always on a mission (even if that mission is grocery shopping as fast as humanly possible). But this month, you might have better reason to do the fast-walk: ghosts from your past sneak up to say hello. Maybe not all of them are scary (a sweetheart from college suddenly starts following all your IG stories), but some of them might rattle you\u2014like that parking ticket you forgot to pay last spring. These ghosts are here to help you tie up loose ends, make peace with the past, and free up your energy. You might be spending a lot of time on-the-go this month, so watch out for the evil airport lobster roll that tempts even the smartest of travelers. Stay away!!!! Like the ghosts from your past, who knows where that thing has been lurking before it made its way to terminal 4.Illustration by Jay Daniel WrightTaurusThis month, you crave deeper connection with those you care about most. Maybe you\u2019re feeling more needy than usual because everyone else seems to be so busy these days. Plan meaningful one-on-one dates to check in with your crew.  But beware the spOooOky taco filled with cilantro\u2026and noOoOthing else prepared special for you by a sleEEeepy zombie kitchen staff. As one of the most indulgent signs of the zodiac, you have high taco standards (more like a flash-fried shell overflowing with shredded pork). Nobody has time for bad tacos, but especially not you.Illustration by Jay Daniel WrightGeminiRight now, you\u2019re craving an extra dose of entertainment\u2014you might be dressing up for a Halloween-themed bar crawl or finally  trying your hand at that escape room. Halloween riles your mischievous spirit. You tend to get real into it. You\u2019ll do a dare, TP a house, scare children with robotic werewolves on your front porch...but some pranks can go too far. Beware the bitter spoonful of cocoa powder here to damage your life for the sake of a funny viral video. It could kill you! It tastes drier than a bag of bones! Noooo!Illustration by Jay Daniel WrightCancerYou\u2019re putting in a lot of effort these days and need some reassurance that you\u2019re on the right track (we acknowledge you, sweet Cancer). Instead of waiting for others to tell you what you\u2019d like to hear, challenge yourself to come out of your shell and speak up this month. But beware! A strong-willed request for lasagna could backfire this month with instead, a platter of vegan lasagna with unmelted nut cheese. Dry and unsatisfying\u2014the stuff of nightmares INDEED.Illustration by Jay Daniel WrightLeoThis month you might find yourself overly ambitious (oh, it\u2019s you again). Just be mindful you don\u2019t neglect your own well-being in the process (sleep is still important!). Since you\u2019re so focused on your new band/book club/kombucha-brewing/fill-in-the-blank project-here this month, you could become temporarily distracted from other departments in life.  Oh NO. Did you accidentally order a steak, well-done and served with plasticware? The most hellish deviant of all kitchen nightmares. You always know what to do Leo, so trust your gut, flip the table and RUN.Illustration by Jay Daniel WrightVirgoThis month you\u2019ll be bringing more balance into your life as you restructure how you distribute your time and energy. There will be opportunities for breakthroughs during the first half of the month, spurring open-hearted creativity, romance, and even a little risk-taking. Don\u2019t be surprised if your general outlook on life even looks a little brighter by month\u2019s end. But beware of unexpected  breadcrumbs from a strange man\u2019s mustache. How did they happen to be sprinkled onto your plate of pasta? We\u2019re not sure, but we\u2019re terrified. You can be very inventive on the spot, Virgo, so either blow them off and hope for the best\u2014or run.Illustration by Jay Daniel WrightLibraThis month, change is imminent with new opportunities rolling in\u2014new job, moving? And since no one\u2019s expecting you to juggle it all (it\u2019s okay to say \u201cno,\u201d Libra), decide what\u2019s worth continuing while opening yourself up for the new. Stay true to yourself while making these big-life decisions. Big life changes can be scary, but not as scary as a martini glass filled with tap water and an olive. The horror! The crime! Where did the GIN go? Is there a shortage? Keep one eye open this month, Libra, and don\u2019t let anything slip below your high standards.Illustration by Jay Daniel WrightScorpioThis month, you\u2019re feeling more energized than you have about anything in a long time. Are you riled up about a cause? Genuinely excited about life? Or maybe it\u2019s because love is in the cards for you, Scorpio! The cool air and the revival of your black wardrobe always seems to enhance your natural mysterious magnetism. You know what else has a mysterious magnetism? 175 year-old royal wedding cake. But resist the allure of this piece of history you won at auction or found in the back of your boss\u2019s mini-fridge! It\u2019s sure to bring bad luck, specifically to your stomach.Illustration by Jay Daniel WrightSagittariusFor the past year, you\u2019ve been in a bit of an incubation mode, but don\u2019t worry it\u2019s not gonna last much longer. Allow yourself plenty of space to wander and reflect to help you strategize the moves you\u2019ll soon be making at your job, in your relationship, or within your home. So for now, finish reading those books, get lost binging an HBO series or even better, get lost in the woods\u2026 but it\u2019s not the Blair Witch you need to worry about\u2026 it\u2019s a diabolical hamburger with no toppings chasing you through the woods! Imposter, begone! However this came to be is an evil doing. If a naked burger shows up on a plate near you soon, don\u2019t say we didn\u2019t warn you. And then RUN.Illustration by Jay Daniel WrightCapricornThis month, you might be considering  switching up some of your after-work activities. You\u2019re a go-getter who believes in challenging yourself, so it\u2019s totally understandable that you, well, get bored after a while. By the end of the month, you\u2019ll cheerfully settle into your new groove, whether you decided to take ceramics classes or learn to play the guitar on YouTube.  There\u2019s so much to explore within yourself this month, Capricorn, but it might lead you to also explore the pantry: is that cinnamon raisin bread or ...mold? You may be hungry, and you may be fearless, but this is one malevolent villain you need not dare to face.Illustration by Jay Daniel WrightAquariusYou\u2019ve got an edge this month that\u2019s giving you new life. Helpful ideas arrive from random people you meet, and since no one is telling you what to do, you\u2019re more open to new possibilities than usual (you can take that trip and write it off as a business expense). You might be considering a move, a major update to the home, or some exciting changes within your career role. You will have much more clarity by the end of the month. Until then, bEwArE!! You might encounter a cup of who-knows-how-old milk in your fridge\u2014or is that bubble tea? These curdles might cause a blood-curdling scream if you get too close. Don\u2019t risk it Aquarius.Illustration by Jay Daniel WrightPiscesThe falling leaves and eerie gusts of wind stir your curiosity for all things metaphysical. Yeah, you\u2019re thinking more deeply than usual this month, and you should definitely seek insight from your mentors, your elders, or hey, even your astrologer! Mid-month, you may be challenged to defend your beliefs, but hold strong and you\u2019ll see the results, because next month, your confidence is boosted to a whole new level. But until then, be weary of when the doorbell rings\u2026BEWARE the platter of raw chicken sushi here to taint your life with salmonella! Terrors and tremors of feverish night sweats overcome your imagination!
