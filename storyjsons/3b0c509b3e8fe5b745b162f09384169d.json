Sahadi's has been a family-run business since 1948 and it shows in all aspects. It sells really affordable grains, nuts, beans, and more esoteric Middle Eastern pantry ingredients that are hard to hunt down elsewhere. Plus, the crazy efficient and friendly staff will make you forget that you waited (with a number you pulled from a ticket machine) for 15 minutes to get your hummus fix.BUY THE: labneh! Spanakopita! Za'atar flatbread! Then, hunt down those ingredients you always mean to keep in your pantry but recently ran out of. That means tahini, pomegranate molasses, and all the lentils. Oh, and get a couple of cans of grape leaves while you're tossing things in your basket. Don't skip on the whole wheat pita\u2014it's not otherworldly, but it's really cheap and does the trick.THE VIBE IS: frenzied, especially on Saturdays. The store is not huge and has a popular fanbase. Try going during off hours if crowds aren't your thing, but the customers are a nice community of people who just all happen to have that same hankering for baba ghanoush and taramasalata.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open daily from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., except Sundays.\u2014Carey PolisCourtesy of Sahadi'sWE ALSO LOVESOS ChefsWhere serious cooks stock up in the East VillageTanoreenThe bucket-list-worthy Middle Eastern destination in Bay RidgeMurray's CheeseA cheese lover's dream shop in the West VillageExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
