Most of my meals are made by considering the factors at play\u2014what I most desire to be eating, what ingredients I have, and my willingness to undergo a project\u2014and then puzzling together a route toward dinner that checks as many boxes as possible. The goal is maximum efficiency and maximum reward, everything I want and nothing I don\u2019t. It\u2019s a little bit nutty but mostly fun! I call this mentality the Workaround.A recent Workaround success story is the Big Falafel Cake, a recipe I developed to fit the particular need for falafel without the frying. While I\u2019d always like to eat falafel, with its crispy, craggy edges and tender, herby interior, I usually leave the preparation to the professionals. Not only does deep-frying at home feel like a heavy lift, but I\u2019m also not the type of gal to remember to soak my chickpeas the night before I need them. I figured this meal was an ideal candidate for a Workaround.That\u2019s one large falafel.\nPhotograph by Isa Zapata. \u00a0Food Styling by Susan Ottaviano. \u00a0Prop Stying by Maeve Sheridan and Molly LongwellSo when I craved falafel on a weeknight, I decided to supersize it and employ the oven, crafting an XL baked falafel cake rather than individual fritters. The base comes together entirely in the food processor, which makes it both speedy to complete and easy to clean up after. First, you blitz red onion, garlic, herbs, and spices (plus some baking powder for lift and a little starch for cohesion) until your biggest onion pieces are about the size of chickpeas. Then you\u2019ll add two cans of drained and rinsed chickpeas and an egg, pulsing to break down and combine. Because canned chickpeas are more tender and less likely to hold their shape than soaked dried chickpeas, take care not to over-blend the mixture or you\u2019ll end up with hummus. Some coarse texture is necessary, so it\u2019s better to err on the side of less broken down than overly so (that\u2019s also why we do the onion and garlic first, which are in no danger of being over-blitzed).Finally, to cook the cake, you\u2019ll transfer the mixture to a hot, oiled skillet to crisp the bottom, then move the whole thing to the oven to finish baking through. By flipping the finished cake onto a plate to serve, you\u2019ll have the browned side on top\u2014delightfully bronzed and begging for you to slice into wedges. This is not super-crunchy deep-fried falafel, but a gently crisped cake with that same tender, herby interior, fragrant with cumin, coriander, and cayenne for an unmistakable falafel flavor. To make it a meal, serve it with a salad on the side (I like cucumbers and pickled red onion, but a green salad or tomato salad would also be great) as well as a drizzle of yogurt sauce for a bit of creamy richness.Baked falafel cake definitely prioritizes efficiency thanks to its speed, reliance on mostly fridge and pantry staples, and avoidance of any techniques that could turn me off on a Wednesday night. But based on the frequency that I\u2019ve come back to the recipe, it might be a dream dinner, not a best-that-I-could-do dinner, after all\u2014a Workaround meal that\u2019s beaten the odds to become a regular part of the rotation.Get the recipeBig Baked Falafel Cake With Cucumber SaladNo need to fight over the last falafel\u2014this sliceable one is big enough for everyone.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
