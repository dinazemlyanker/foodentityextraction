But you know what\u2019s not a to-do? Leftovers Day, the second best food holiday of the year.Held one to three days after Thanksgiving, Leftovers Day is\u2026the day you eat all your leftovers. It\u2019s a great way to ensure you aren\u2019t stuck with a spoonful of stuffing or weird turkey parts in a ziplock bag that someone (me) can\u2019t bring themselves to part with. My favorite way to celebrate is with other people, everyone gathered under one roof to clean out fridges and compare stuffings. Think of it as a Friendsgiving but without having to roast another turkey.This holiday can be as low-maintenance as opening a few plastic containers and drinking the rest of the wine you overbought, but occasionally I like to pull out all the stops, which is to say pile everything into a baking dish, cover it with dough, and bake it at 425\u00b0 until golden brown and bubbling. Sound like a pot pie? That\u2019s because it is, made from the greatest hits of your holiday table.Here\u2019s how leftover turkey pot pie works: Combine leftover turkey (picked into bite-size pieces), roasted or saut\u00e9ed veg (fennel, carrots, squash, mushrooms, etc.), and any herbs you didn\u2019t use up (coarsely chopped) in a baking vessel of your choice (13x9\" baking dish, 2-qt. oval, anything goes). Mix in any extra gravy or thin leftover mashed potatoes with turkey or chicken stock until the consistency is looser than gravy (it\u2019ll thicken as it bakes). If you still have pie dough, use that to top it off, or try store-bought puff pastry.Either way, do not forget the egg wash on top\u2014even leftovers deserve to get dressed up.You know what leftovers go well with?How to Keep All That Party Booze Cold\u2014Without Using Your FridgeWhen Alison Roman hosts, the wine goes in the bathroom, not the kitchen.View StoryExplore Bon App\u00e9titParty TricksLeftoversThanksgivingRecipes you want to make.
