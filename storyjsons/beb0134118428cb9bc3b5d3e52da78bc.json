But according to actress and comedian Sasheer Zamata, the best option may be something you already have in your house: water.Don\u2019t worry, this isn\u2019t about to be a lecture on how much water you should be drinking daily. Instead, it\u2019s about what\u2019s in your water. When I sat down with the star of I Feel Pretty (and former best Rihanna impersonator on SNL) I was distracted by her truly radiant skin. While there are some rosehip and coconut oils involved, she says she owes the past year of looking good\u2014and, in fact, feeling pretty\u2014to Berkey water filters.Twist this on your showerhead and instantly feel beautiful.\nCourtesy of Berkey\u201cI had a few conversations and did some research about what\u2019s in water, even the so-called \u2018cleanest\u2019 New York City water where I live, and realized I needed to get those chemicals out of my body,\u201d Zamata explained. \u201d[The filter] really cleans the water ... it\u2019s hard to describe how water tastes, but it\u2019s better. Crisp. Not like garbage!\u201dThe countertop filtration system and travel water bottle that purify water by removing more than 200 contaminants are essential to her life now, but the best \u201cBerkey-ed out\u201d part of her life is the showerhead filter. \u201cIn the last year since using it, my skin has cleared up, my hair feels better, and it all just looks good. Other things could be in play, but I think it\u2019s because of the water,\u201d she raved.Zamata also noticed that it makes her water less hard (aka with less minerals) and she wishes she could twist it on and off when traveling between LA and New York. \u201cI miss mine when I\u2019m gone,\u201d she said wistfully, suggesting that she team up with Berkey to make a portable showerhead. She's more than willing to be their spokeswoman.Her other wellness rituals include using coconut oil for oil pulling and moisturizing dry elbows, drinking hot water with apple cider and vinegar to \u201cwake up and clean the whole system out,\u201d and \u201dshrinking everything and getting smooth\u201d with Indian aztec clay masks. Beats hitting your head on a SoulCycle bike in order to feel pretty.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCelebritiesHealthyishShoppingRead MorecultureHow Samira Wiley Practices Self-Care After a Long Day on the 'Handmaid's Tale'By Alyse WhitneyRecipes you want to make.
