Here\u2019s what happened next.By Kwame AlexanderMay 7, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Gaurab ThakaliFacebookTwitterEmailLast month I asked 12 accomplished writerly friends to reflect on how their lives may now mirror that of their mothers, with a particular focus on what happens in their kitchens. They each got the same prompt\u2014\u201cI Am Becoming My Mother\u201d\u2014a title I borrowed from the Jamaican poet Lorna Goodison (who also contributed some new stanzas for this project). Then, like a puzzle maker, in the tradition of\u00a0the surrealist drawing game known as Exquisite Corpse\u00a0and the collaborative\u00a0renga poetry of Japan, I took the pieces and assembled a tapestry of lines to create one crowdsourced, community poem. These are our voices. As one. \u2014Kwame AlexanderListen to Kwame read the poem below:ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.The Ceremony of GivingI am becoming my motherin ways I never expectedcursing the Boston Red Soxwhile okra softens like her facekneading the ceremonial Friday night challah\u2014the same dark veins, the Tigris, the Euphrates,spreading life into each tributary.The way I fan the cucumberfor my daughters\u2019 daughteror fold the prayer beneath the forkThe way she gatheredhandfuls of my damp red curlsin a towel at bath time,her fingers pulsing with loveguiding me without a wordthrough the maze of childhoodand the shadows beyondI am becoming my motherunexpectedly hummingher favorite Chopin \u00e9tudein the kitchenas if it were 1958Molding soft fleshcutting each biscuit, making sure notto twist the cutter and seal the edges.My hands pressed against the open shells of eggsquickly movingfrom pot to potjust as hers did\u2014tuning each course of the meal like drums.We\u2019re golosinas, women who love sweetsat the market, I pick a ripeavocado the way she taught meI\u2019ve accepted my se\u00f1oratransmutation, the needto feed my family until they groan.I hear her voiceAre you full?
