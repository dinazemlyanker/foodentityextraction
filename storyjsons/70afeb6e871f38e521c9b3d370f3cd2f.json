Me? A very large canvas bag filled with beautiful vessels from ceramicist Karina Subijana of Altar Ceramics.I loved her pieces so much when I dined at the Mill House and Lineage, I DM\u2019d her on Instagram to meet at her studio and buy some of her hand-thrown wares. Sure, bespoke ceramics are very now for restaurants to commission, but all of Subijana\u2019s ceramics feel very Hawaii, from like the beachy-looking mug ($48) to the teal bowl with a drippy glaze ($52) to the sand-hued noodle bowl ($56). \u201cI like to incorporate natural elements into my work,\u201d Subijana told me. \u201cSpeckled whites, teals, and greens remind me of where the waves meet the sand.\u201dSubijana first got into pottery a few years ago after giving birth to her son and in search of elusive \u201cme\u201d time. \u201cBeing a full-time mother of a new baby, I felt as though I was tending to everything and nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cWith pottery, I was able to center and focus myself on one task and, after a few weeks, I was holding beautiful objects, tangible fruits of my labor, that I could use in my kitchen and home.\u201dAs I toured her studio, in Hana on the southeast side of Maui, I couldn\u2019t help but touch all the wide, shallow bowls and chubby mugs. I loved their satisfying heft and sturdy roundness; they felt like worthy investment pieces but not so precious that I couldn\u2019t also eat instant ramen out of them. My bags were already dangerously full, but I couldn\u2019t resist taking home several of those aforementioned bowls. And while I endured some stressful unpacking and repacking in order to get them home, you won\u2019t have to: Subijana just revamped her online shop.Buy it: Altar CeramicsAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
