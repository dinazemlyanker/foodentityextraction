See our past recommendations here!I\u2019ve been journaling since I was 14, always using a Pilot Precise V5 pen to scribble in a hardback lined notebook (a couple dozens of which are stored at my parents\u2019 house). In the uncharted territory of empty pages, journaling is an in-the-moment, chaotic task. Sometimes I unleash a stream of consciousness onto the page. Other times, it\u2019s organized lists, goals, and promises I make to myself. Either way, after the writing is done, it\u2019s virtually impossible to go back and locate entries from a particular time period. Where were those New Year\u2019s resolutions I made in 2020? Gone into the abyss, along with the list of my favorite parties from 2018.Not so since I signed up for Silk + Sonder\u2019s monthly journal, a subscription service founded in 2019 by entrepreneur Meha Agrawal. Lightweight and good-looking without being too cutesy, this part-planner, part-journal dedicates one third of its pages for free-flowing writing and two thirds for structured prompts, which caters to my internal control freak and musing philosopher in equal measure. Each month\u2019s delivery focuses on a single theme with prompts designed to illuminate the concept from different angles. In September, the month of Observation, I was instructed to note daily descriptions of my mood. October, themed Tranquility, paired journaling with lists of five things that calmed me. In January, themed Ambition, I filled out an ikigai questionnaire (named after the Japanese term of \u201cfinding one\u2019s reason for being\u201d) designed to clarify career goals and marry them with purpose.Sure, Silk + Sonder journals are a bit of a commitment if you fill out absolutely all of the monthly lists, mood trackers, and more. But, as my thoughts grew increasingly erratic over the course of 2020, I found the structural support of the journals soothing and reassuring. Filling them with small, simplified details about my daily life has been just as therapeutic as pouring my heart out on the page unprompted; while the big picture of my life feels totally obscure (anyone else?), at least I got the little bits covered. I might go back to the vast freedom of blank notebooks someday, but while the world continues to make little sense, I\u2019ll be sticking with a journaling ritual that does.Silk + Sonder Journal$20 at Silk + Sonder (Monthly)$54 at Silk + Sonder (Quarterly)Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish Loves ItShoppingSelf CareRecipes you want to make.
