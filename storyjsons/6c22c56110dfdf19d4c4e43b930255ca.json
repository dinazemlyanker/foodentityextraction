In food culture right now, everyone is looking for spice and flavors. This really speaks to both. It\u2019s an interesting combination using a classic Southern dish of shrimp and grits and pairing it with hot chicken.\u201d Read an interview with Richards about the recipe and more, here.Ingredients4 servingsGrits Croutons1Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. kosher salt2cups uncooked stone-ground grits4oz. aged cheddar, shredded (about 1 cup)\u00bdcup heavy cream3Tbsp. unsalted butter1\u00bdtsp. coarsely ground black pepper, divided\u00bccup blended olive oil1cup plain yellow cornmeal1tsp. granulated onionShrimp and Assembly2Tbsp. plus 4 tsp. blended olive oil1small onion, finely chopped (about 1 cup)\u00bccup dry white wine2cups heavy cream\u00bccup hot sauce, such as Tabasco1Tbsp. cayenne pepper2tsp. finely grated lemon zest1tsp. kosher salt1tsp. chili powder1tsp. granulated garlic1tsp. paprika\u00bdtsp. coarsely ground black pepper\u00bctsp. fennel seeds20unpeeled colossal raw shrimp (about 1\u00bd lb.), deveined\u00bccup chopped parsley2Tbsp. salted butterPreparationGrits CroutonsStep 1Bring 1 Tbsp. salt and 8 cups water to a boil in a medium stockpot over medium heat.
