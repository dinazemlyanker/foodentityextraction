But when my mom couldn\u2019t travel due to the pandemic, \u00a0it was up to me.By Charlene Wang de ChenJuly 29, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Lisk FengFacebookTwitterEmailAt 3:57 a.m. on Monday, March 30th, I was woken by a text from my brother-in-law: \u201cBaby girl Ruby was born at 1:09 a.m.\u201d It was my sister\u2019s first baby, and our parents\u2019 first grandchild. After exchanging excited messages with my family in our group chat, I got out of bed and walked to the still dark kitchen. I picked up a piece of ginger and a spoon and, standing over the sink, began doing what newly minted Chinese aunts have done for thousands of years upon receiving news of a birth in the family: I started peeling ginger.There are two cornerstones to observing zuo yue zi\u2014\u5750\u6708\u5b50\"\u2014the ancient Chinese postpartum tradition of caring for new mothers: eating nourishing and restorative foods loaded with specialty ingredients, and confinement. Literally translated, zuo yue zi means \u201csitting a moon cycle,\u201d and is a tradition that has been documented as early as 960 AD. With confinement pretty much taken care of by COVID quarantine, it was my job to provide my sister with the restorative dishes.The first on my list was ginger fried rice, a dish I was so familiar with I didn\u2019t need a recipe. I used my cleaver to julienne two inches of peeled ginger to the width of matchsticks, and then with the flat body of the cleaver I smashed garlic, easing the dried peels from the cloves and releasing the juices as my mom had taught me when I was first learning to cook. My sister likes a lot of garlic, so I added a bit more than I knew the dish called for.Next up was jujube soup with goji berry and chicken, and two hot drinks, the first made with oats, ginger, and cinnamon, and the second with jujube and goji berries. Unlike ginger fried rice, I had no muscle memory for these things, so I cooked standing in the glow of my phone, carefully following recipes a friend had photographed from The First Forty Days, a book I couldn\u2019t get a physical copy of in time for baby Ruby\u2019s birth but whose guidance had nonetheless been an essential part of my crash course in zuo yue zi.Just a few months before, all I knew about this ritual was that it involved food. I had no idea which foods, let alone how to prepare them.As the reigning matriarch of our family unit, my mom was supposed to be in charge of making the zuo yue zi dishes for my sister, Tiffany, much like my great-grandmother had done for her. The plan was for my mom to fly from her home in California to New York and stay with me for a month to help take care of my sister. But as Tiffany\u2019s due date drew near, and the pandemic unfolded at a furious pace, the number of confirmed cases and deaths mounting daily, the plan had to be scrapped. By late March, when my sister was about to deliver at NYU Langone hospital, New York City was the national epicenter of COVID-19. All non-essential businesses were closed, Governor Cuomo was on TV each day communicating a dire need for ventilators, and grocery stores, once mazes of high-stacked plenty had become chess boards for high-stakes maneuvers; bearing the burden of our collective anxieties about survival, scarcity, and preparedness.Not only could my mom not stay with me in New York City and prepare the zuo yue zi foods, just getting the basic ingredients would be a challenge.I have no experience caring for infants\u2014I have never changed a diaper in my life and do not plan on having any biological children of my own. The responsibility of being my sister\u2019s sole postpartum helper was daunting. But cooking? That I could do. I haven\u2019t met a food challenge I didn\u2019t relish, and preparing zuo yue zi during a pandemic would be the ultimate challenge.My husband Tony\u2019s parents live in Beijing, so our awareness of COVID\u2014and our concern for the health and safety of family\u2014began in January. Tony runs a travel company focused on boutique travel to and from China (educational tours in China; private guides for Chinese travelers in New York City), which meant that our income was also affected starting in January.It was around lunchtime on March 12th that I learned that my building\u2019s doorman had COVID. I\u2019m a set decorator for film and television and that day I was preparing a set for a show filming the second to last episode in a season. By that evening the producers told everyone on the production crew that we were shutting down indefinitely\u2014we could start collecting unemployment. Five days later our building doorman, Juan, died from COVID.With both Tony and me suddenly unemployed, and New York City getting worse by the minute, we considered joining friends who\u2019d invited us to stay with them on their farm outside of Nashville, Tennessee. It sounded perfect. But my sister was pregnant. I couldn\u2019t leave her behind.My sister Tiffany and I have always been close. I helped her buy her first fancy makeup in high school, I've helped her move into multiple apartments, and I helped plan her wedding. When we both ended up in the city\u2013\u2013her for a job as an oncology nurse practitioner\u2013\u2013it was no coincidence that our apartments were only four subway stops apart, mine in the South Bronx and hers in Harlem. Tiffany is the person I want to call when I\u2019ve got good gossip, she\u2019s who I call when I need to cry.I always assumed I\u2019d have a role in helping her postpartum recovery, but I also assumed that, at least for the first few months, mine would be a supporting role. My mom would be the lead, there to guide my sister through those first and toughest days.By March 17 we\u2019d all agreed it made sense for my parents to cancel their trip to New York. I cried. They were going to miss such an important family event, we wouldn\u2019t be able to welcome Ruby into the world together or celebrate the arrival of the next generation. Like most people in New York City, I\u2019d been riding a rollercoaster of emotions: sadness, grief, anxiety, anger, and helplessness.It slowly dawned on me that my parents not coming also meant that I would be in charge of preparing the zuo yue zi foods.It is hard to describe the exact breakdown of Chinese-ness to American-ness our specific childhood cocktail of cultural influence was. I'm a fourth-generation Chinese American, and we spoke English at home, but I often relate more to the experience of many second-generation immigrant kids.Because of the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, Chinese-American families had a hard time immigrating as a unified entity until after 1965, and so the lines of clearly demarcated generations in terms of \u201csecond generation\u201d or \u201cfourth generation\u201d are not precise. Both of my parents immigrated to the United States in their teens to finish their schooling and join their parents (or in the case of my mom, her parents and grandparents). A common experience of second generation kids, across cultures, is feeling pressure to succeed on behalf of their family and their sacrifices, which I think my dad felt more than me. Second generation kids often have to translate or act as an advocate and go-between for parents and mainstream American society, which I also didn\u2019t experience. But having different, weird foods and not understanding the same cultural references as classmates; being the first in a family to navigate certain elite institutions were all things I did experience. My parents and I could tell each other jokes in English, but Chinese culture, language, and values often informed my parents in a way that felt foreign to me.My mom, as the youngest in her family, did not know how to make all the right zuo yue zi foods either. She\u2019d been binging YouTube videos to prepare. She was so anxious about leading the charge in fact that she\u2019d repeatedly asked my sister and me to find someone in the New York City area who would come to my sister\u2019s home and do it for us, a service available in the Chinese American immigrant community.By the time I\u2019d taken over zuo yue zi food prep, hiring a stranger to come over and cook was no longer an option. My Yi-Ma (older maternal aunt) called me to sympathize, \u201cWell now you have to be a sister, aunt, mother, and grandmother to your sister!\u201d And my mom started sending me links to the YouTube zuo yue zi Chinese cooking videos.I lamented to one of my best friends, Lyle, that I felt totally clueless. Lyle, whose farm we\u2019d been invited to in Tennessee, also happens to run a fertility acupuncture practice. So even though she is not Chinese-American, she instantly knew the answer: The First Forty Days, a book written in English by a Chinese-American woman named Heng Ou explains zuo yue zi, what it means in a western and modern context, and what\u2019s involved.It was exactly what I needed. But I couldn\u2019t get a copy in time for Ruby\u2019s due date because mail orders were incredibly backed up. While I waited, Lyle sent me photos of key recipes: Ginger fried rice with bacon, chicken soup with jujube and ginger that Ou describes as \u201ca time-tested combo used to boost circulation and enhance inner warmth\u201d; and a jujube goji berry tonic\u2013\u2013\u201cthe quintessential zuo yuezi drink with its wonder-duo of warming ingredients\u2026 a daily must-drink for all moms.\u201dI\u2019d resolved to give myself over to Heng Ou, reverting to the formula that got me straight A\u2019s in high school: carefully studying the textbook and obediently following directions. In hindsight I realize I didn\u2019t even consider doing a test run. My plan was to make everything for the first time when I got word that Tiffany had delivered the baby.Getting ingredients for these dishes was another story. I do not live within walking distance of any grocery stores that carry specialty Chinese ingredients like dried jujubes and goji berries, and a lot of those that did, in Chinatown, were closed anyway. I couldn\u2019t rely on internet sources to deliver herbs quickly enough. And even the large Asian grocery stores\u2013\u2013like H Mart in Bayside, Queens\u2013\u2013were sold out of poultry. I had to be resourceful.It took a while, but finally I\u2019d collected everything I needed (ordering what I could online; driving to neighboring towns with larger Asian grocery stores). I even had two whole freshly killed and plucked chickens that my husband helped me procure from the halal live poultry shop near us in the Bronx.By the evening of April first, when it was time to collect Tiffany and family from the hospital, all the soups and drinks and tonics were ready\u2014hot and packed.As Tony and I drove through the city we passed the rows of cold storage trailers outside Bellevue and NYU Langone Hospitals, used to manage the abnormally high number of dead bodies emerging due to COVID. It was a haunting sight made even stranger by the fact that because we couldn\u2019t be near the baby, Tony had outfitted the car with plastic drop cloths to separate the front and back seats.We called my sister from the curb and taxied the new family back to their apartment. I met Ruby for the first time through the pane of glass separating the apartment entry from the sidewalk. We said goodbye and watched them carry the tubs of chicken, jujube, ginger, goji berry soup; ginger fried rice; homemade oat milk with cinnamon and ginger; the jujube and goji tonic, and all the love and hope and connection I\u2019d felt as I\u2019d participated in this ancient postpartum food ritual.Over the next 40 days I would continue to box up new and different homemade soups, stews, and tonics in my kitchen, delivering them to the same glass entryway. As the zuo yue zi period progressed, and my anxiety levels rose and fell with the news, I realized that zuo yue zi had become a life raft\u2014I felt useful, and the aroma and tastes of the food brought me closer to my family. The fragrance of ginger and garlic cooking in oil mixed with raw chopped scallions and filled my little kitchen exactly as it had in my grandma\u2019s in Brookline, Massachusetts, and my mom\u2019s in Orange County, California.And though the sound of ambulance sirens rushed by with alarming frequency, insomnia became a new feature of my nights, and I was still unemployed; I knew that despite all that, there was more goji tonic to be made, and more jujube chicken soup, and always more ginger to be peeled.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishCoronavirusChineseessayRead MorecultureWhat It's Like to Be a Doula Helping People Give Birth Over FaceTimeBy Erica Chidi CohenRecipes you want to make.
