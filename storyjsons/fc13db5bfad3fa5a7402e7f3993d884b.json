You\u2019ve got beans. You\u2019ve got olives. You\u2019ve got: dinner!By Rachel KartenSeptember 26, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Sue LiFacebookTwitterEmailIf there was a \u201cSlow-Roasted Fish Fan Club\u201d I\u2019d be the president. I make this Healthyish slow-cooked white fish with charred cabbage at least once a week. And Alison Roman\u2019s slow-roasted salmon is as easy as it is impressive. And now I have a new recipe to add my slow-roasted arsenal: Claire Saffitz\u2019s Roast Fish with Cannellini Beans and Green Olives.This throw-together dinner uses pantry staples like canned beans and lemons. But don\u2019t let the humble ingredient list fool you\u2014what you end up with is creamy cannellinis studded with olives and chile all hanging out in an herby olive oil, topped with lemon-y tender fish.Luckily the steps for the recipe are as low-key as the ingredient list. You start things off by combining fresh oregano, canned beans (the recipe calls for cannellini but chickpeas or butter beans would work well too!), torn Castelvetrano olives, and water in a 3-qt. baking dish. You then place the fish (I used cod but the recipe works with any whitefish fillet) on top of the beans, or as Saffitz puts it \u201cnestle into beans\u201d, and scatter thinly sliced shallots and Fresno chiles over everything. Now here comes the part where the recipe goes from average weeknight dinner to weeknight dinner worth painting-by-number: You are going to arrange slices of thinly sliced lemon over the surface of the fish so that they are slightly overlapping. You did hear that shingling was one of the biggest trends this year, right? Once you\u2019ve done that, drizzle everything with lots of olive oil and pop it into a 300 degree oven.See? Don\u2019t you want to paint it by numbers?\nPhoto by Alex LauIt\u2019s important to note that even though the word \u201cslow\u201d is in the whole technique for this fish, the process is anything but. The fish is only in the oven for around 30 minutes, and while you theoretically could cook the fish in less time on a higher heat, that low and slow method is what provides the best insurance against overcooking. Which is a very important kind of insurance. If you want to be extra certain the fish is done, you could go with this technique that Saffitz talked about to Healthyish a few months back: \u201cUse a metal cake tester by sliding it into the fish and pressing it to your lower lip for three seconds. If the metal is warm, the fish is done. If it\u2019s hot, the fish is probably overcooked, and if the metal is still cool, put it back in the oven.\u201d Smart.Once the fish is done, take it out and let it rest for 5-10 minutes. Yes, fish needs to rest too. It\u2019s a chance to let the flavors mingle together a little longer while letting the fish cool slightly. While that\u2019s happening make sure the beans stay submerged-ish in the liquid (you don\u2019t want them to dry out!). Then serve everything with a few lemon wedges to squeeze over. And if you\u2019re future me, some crusty bread to sop up all the brothy beans, too.Get the recipe:Roast Fish with Cannellini Beans and Green OlivesThis is one of those throw-together dinner recipes that relies on staples like canned beans and lemons; all you have to do is pick up the fish.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titWeeknightFishVegetarianWhite BeanRecipes you want to make.
