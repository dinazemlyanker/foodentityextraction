Corn is great here, but chopped up tomatoes, broccoli, summer squash, and even green beans are fair game. The not-so-secret is a handful of parm and a knob of butter right at the end, which turn a handful of humble ingredients into a rich, saucy, cohesive dish. \u2014Chris MoroccoThis recipe is part of Short Is Sweet, our collection of summer dishes that deliver a whole lot of deliciousness in 30 minutes or less.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Didn\u2019t have very much parm and it was still good. I didn\u2019t use all of the pasta water which kept the sauce creamier. Will definitely make again Kat2/28/2022Yummy weeknight meal!S BurrellMaine11/17/2021Made this recipe without any additions because the picture looked so good.  I was disappointed.  With fewer ingredients, less time, and a lot less cholesterol, you can make cacio e pepe, and it will be twice as good.H. FukudaLaguna Niguel, CA9/26/2021This was excellent!!John Columbus Pittsburgh9/17/2021To thicken the sauce add a little instant potato.CookieSpokane8/23/2021Was good...would add less water at the end, and use more cheese and corn. (Found it to be rather salty as well, but I only had salted butter so maybe the culprit). Also added sliced cherry tomatoes and sauteed zucchini (as we have heaps to eat at the moment!!) to round it out as a one-dish meal. JJGallNY8/3/2021Absolutely delicious! Such a flavor bomb dish. I used hot sausage links for added heat flavor as well as cherry tomatoes for an additional sweet element. I only used one cup of the pasta water and used orecchiette pasta. 1000% this dish will be in my recipe rotation \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83c\udf73MissMeganEastampton, NJ8/2/2021We loved the flavor of this dish and it was super simple to prepare. Only negative was that the sauce was rather \u201csoupy\u201d for our taste. I added only the 1/2 cup of water with the corn and the1cup of pasta water. I don\u2019t want to reduce the overall amount of liquid though. Next time, maybe add a simple cornstarch slurry at the end? Other suggestions welcome!Loves to cook!Hershey, PA7/28/2021Absolutely delicious. I made it with pork sweet Italian sausage. And fresh sweet corn we bought from the back of a pickup truck. We are in Iowa, after all. Two thumbs up!Tim EarpDes Moines, Iowa7/26/2021This was so amazing! Can\u2019t wait to eat my leftovers.AnonymousMilwaukee, WI7/4/2021Made this with Impossible Burger meat. Really delicious. Great leftovers.gruffgordonLos Angeles, CA7/2/2021Does the corn get added uncooked?Anonymous6/24/2021This is one of those recipes where the whole is better than the sum of its parts.  It was delicious.  That being said, I did use spicy sausage due to preference, and added 2 cups of cherry tomatoes along with the corn, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Will make again with those same modifications.Anonymous6/17/2021So good!  So easy and satisfying. Loved. AnonymousWauwatosa,WI6/15/2021Delish! I used diced field roast sausage instead of the real deal and parsley, and it still turned out great! Excited to add this as a hearty regular.DotdotdotTacoma, WA, United States6/10/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titPastaCornVegetableSausageMeatRigatoniPasta & NoodlesSpaghettiSummerEasyQuickWeeknight MealsMainNut-FreeDinnerRecipes you want to make.
