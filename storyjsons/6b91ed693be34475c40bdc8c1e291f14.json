Pro tip: If you sign up for the Healthyish newsletter, you\u2019ll get the scoop before everyone else.When I started working on our \u201cWhat\u2019s for Lunch?\u201d feature in the March issue of the magazine, I was in a dark place foodwise. Gone were the days when rolling out and cooking fresh flatbreads seemed like a cute and fun and novel thing to do in the middle of the workday (yes, I know, who was I?!). I had transitioned to the \u201cshoving plain crackers into my mouth sometime between the hours of 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.\u201d phase of quar-cooking. Opening anything (a can of tuna, a bag of rice, the fridge) seemed like too much work.But it wasn\u2019t just the physical routine of cooking that was exhausting me. It was the sheer fact of having to think about what I was going to shop for and cook, long before I reached for a mixing bowl or turned on the stove. I would buy a head of broccoli, rack my brain for something interesting to do with it, come up with no ideas that appealed, then finally give up and devolve into my cracker spiral again.But working on the recipes, strategies, and tips in this feature inspired something of a cooking renaissance. I\u2019ve made Hetty McKinnon\u2019s Peanut Noodles With Cucumbers multiple times, cleaning out several mostly empty jars of nut butter in my pantry in the process. I\u2019ve been dreaming of Basically editor Sarah Jampel\u2019s Broccoli Melts, which remind me of Stouffer\u2019s French bread pizza in an extremely good way. I want to make each and every one of these sandwiches. My roommate, who\u2019s even more over the whole cooking thing than I am these days, just made Test Kitchen director Chris Morocco\u2019s Soy and Scallion Tofu Bowl and declared it one of the best things she\u2019d made in months.Sometimes all you need to re-spark the desire to cook is someone else\u2019s idea, and when you work at a food magazine, there\u2019s never a shortage of those. I hope you check out the recipes and tips from the BA folks and contributors who worked on this lunch story, whether in print or online. And I hope their ideas will help restore a little joy to your next meal.Here's What I'm Making for Lunch This Week:Photo by Laura Murray, food styling by Susie TheodorouSoy and Scallion Tofu BowlPeanut Butter Noodles With CucumbersGreen Curry Lentil SoupChickpea Pancakes With Greens and CheeseLunch Nachos With Spiced CauliflowerBroccoli MeltsExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishWhat's Chaey Cooking?LunchessayRecipes you want to make.
