It\u2019s FoolproofNew recipes from our simple issue, food news, and one corny food feud from the week.By Alex BeggsJuly 13, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiFacebookTwitterEmailEvery Friday morning, Bon App\u00e9tit senior staff writer Alex Beggs shares weekly highlights from the BA offices, from awesome new recipes to office drama to restaurant recs, with some weird (food!) stuff she saw on the internet thrown in. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Cook the coverOur August issue came out this week (subscribers should start getting it next week. Please subscribe, for the love of god)! It\u2019s our annual \u201csimple\u201d issue, where the recipes keep it under 10-ish ingredients. On the cover: strawberry-raspberry fools. You can guess where the name comes from. It\u2019s foolproof! Macerated berries, softly whipped cream, layered in cute-ass cups. Make it!Get the recipe: Strawberry-Raspberry FoolsThe Price of FishIn a luxurious turn of events, Christina Chaey and I attended a special legacy dinner at Per Se this week, which brought back four alumni chefs from the Thomas Keller restaurant, ten years after they cooked there. JuneBaby\u2019s Edouardo Jordan made tiny pimiento cheese tartlets topped with perfectly circular cutouts of truffle and I\u2019m going to have to live with that the rest of my life. Daisy Ryan, now the chef of Bell\u2019s in Los Alamos, served a ridiculous va-va-voom steak tartare under a bonfire of julienned truffle sticks, \u201cbecause why not,\u201d she said. The power of positive thinking! And we met Don Pedro, the nickname for one of the staff member's uncles\u2014actual name Peter\u2014who was in town from England, where he is a courier of...human organs. He told us a riveting tale of transporting a woman\u2019s brain in a bucket recently. Yesterday, he\u2019d had dinner at the Olive Garden in Times Square, bought a few shirts at Tommy Bahama, saw Chicago on Broadway, and then had a Budweiser and \u201ccontemplated the price of fish.\u201d (British humor.) But tonight, he was dining at Per Se.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!NYC100Did you see our big NYC100 list this week? I contributed my undying love for Old Town Bar, one of the only places in this city to get your Buffalo wings delivered by dumbwaiter. On a recent hot afternoon, I stopped in for a lemonade. LEMONADE. It was great. Is your favorite place missing? Well, chill out, and have some lemonade: We\u2019ll be updating it every month.Photo by Alex BeggsDon\u2019t lick the ice creamMaybe you saw the news this week that a Texas teen licked the smooth top of a gallon of Blue Bell\u2019s Tin Roof ice cream before returning it to the grocery-store freezer shelf, horrifying the nation and spurring saliva-slinging copycats. In reality, the probability of getting the licked ice cream and catching any germs from it was quite low. (Unless she had mono\u2014teens!) And it\u2019s all kind of ironic considering BB had a big listeria scandal a few years back. A classic case of out-of-proportion outrage. I shudder to think what my library books have been through, which is why I read with rubber gloves on. But as a Texan, I believe we need to respect our natural resources, the proudest being Blue Bell, so yeah, don\u2019t lick it \u2019til you get home. A motto to live by.Ashley BatzJoin the Bean ClubOur workplace likes to order things as a family\u2014usually cases of wine. But this week, Chaey made an order from Rancho Gordo beans (read about their AMAZING BEANS in this New Yorker article) and everybody jumped in the bean pot. Climbed the beanstalk? Sarah Jampel got vaquero beans, which have a black-and-white Dalmation look. A unique bean for a unique bean! Emily Schultz ordered green French lentils and Marcella beans (my favorite), \u201cbecause I\u2019m a basic bean,\u201d she said. Easygoing Aliza Abarbanel went with unfussy yellow eye beans. Chaey got the yellow Indian beans \u201cbecause Amiel told me to,\u201d but it makes sense to me\u2014an eye-catching, stylish bean!Spiced bird\u201cAll he needed was a bath.\u201dUnnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekEva KolenkoI made an awesome recipe for corn pudding from Nicole Rucker\u2019s new cookbook, Dappled, and it inspired a variety of reactions. Aren\u2019t corn desserts universally great? Not to Chris Morocco, who frowned while angrily whisking a meringue. \u201cI\u2019m cool with corn flavor, like a corn muffin,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the presence of whole, sweet corn kernels I find upsetting.\u201d At another station in the Test Kitchen was Nicole Rucker herself! Making a cobbler for our Instagram stories. \u201cPRO!\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s naturally sweet!\u201d With her recipe, she added, corn\u2019s natural starch can thicken the pudding without cornstarch. Impressive! I ran into Julia Kramer in the hallway\u2014thoughts on corn desserts? \u201cPeople are always trying to make that a thing,\u201d she laughed. Molly Baz will accept corn ice cream, and \u201ccorn byproducts,\u201d like cornmeal, but she\u2019s also anti-kernel. Carla Lalli Music, same story: \u201cKernels belong on the cob ONLY.\u201d Adam Rapoport said: \u201cSkeptical.\u201d But others were on my side. Andy Baraghani went on and on about Jeni\u2019s corn ice cream with blackberries, as if he was selling it on QVC. Those in favor: Christina Chaey. Emily Schultz. Aliza Abarbanel. THANKS, TEAM. And Amanda Shapiro \u201cloves\u201d corn dessert, but \u201cprefers a rice dessert.\u201d Wait, what?Another great Nicole Rucker recipe: Blueberry and Corn CrispExplore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorerestaurantsThe NYC100 - March 2020 EditionBy The Bon App\u00e9tit StaffcultureA Summer Mood BoardBy Alex BeggscultureThere\u2019s a Snow Cone in the Weekend ForecastBy Alex BeggsrestaurantsThe Hype Ice Cream I\u2019m Willing to Wait in Long, Near-Rioting Lines ForBy Sarah JampelRecipes you want to make.
