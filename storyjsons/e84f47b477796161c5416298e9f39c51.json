But\u2014you thought I was going to follow that up with a but? Well I\u2019m not. This ice cream pie is a cinch.It\u2019s a new recipe from our simple issue (the theme of the August issue), by contributing assistant food editor Kat Boytsova. The filling combines four pints of ice cream\u2014two strawberry, two coconut\u2014that swirl together in a beautiful marble pattern. It reminds me of Princess Frostine\u2019s (that\u2019s right, from Candy Land) pink-and-white gettup, if we\u2019re diving into one specific person\u2019s nostalgia brainwaves. Sweet strawberry and creamy coconut make a dynamic duo, a combination we really don\u2019t exploit enough here at Bon App\u00e9tit.When we tested this recipe in the early spring (paired with Kat\u2019s ros\u00e9 sangria no less), it caused giddy, childlike joy around the prep table. (My Candy Land theory holds up.)Photo by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Alison Attenborough, Prop Styling by Heather GreeneWhy is this so good?! I asked food director Carla Lalli Music, as we cast tasting spoons aside and took whole slices up to our desks. \u201cI think I just ate an entire pint of ice cream,\u201d groaned Carla as she kept eating the pie. The strawberry, the coconut, the coconutty crust. It was all working. \u201cDo you have any notes?\u201d asked Kat. \u201cUhhhh nope.\u201d We answered. It was ready.If you have to stand in front of the class and fess up on what you did this summer vacation, let it be this recipe.Because the crust is salty-amazingGraham cracker crusts are bound with fat\u2014here we\u2019ve got coconut oil to keep everything together, and why not throw some toasted coconut flakes in there while you\u2019re at it for texture?  A generous pinch of salt supercharges the coco-nuttiness and you\u2019ll find yourself eating the crust like a cookie later.We learned how to cut ice cream from Claire Saffitz\u2019s epic ice cream sandwich recipe.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Styling by Sue LiThe swirl looks more complicated than it isSo you soften the ice cream. And uh, make sure to put a sticky note on it so no one puts it back in the freezer or worse, EATS IT ALL, WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT, BILL, I WAS MAKING A PIE. Kat recommends cutting the ice cream into chunks (you can cut ice cream, yes) and putting it in two bowls (one for strawb, one for coconut). When the ice creams are soft enough to stir with a spatula, stir them until they feel like the consistency of thick cake batter, at which point put the bowls in the freezer for a quick 10 minute break. You\u2019re about to swirl them together, so the more slightly-solid they are, the better for that marble effect. Scrape the strawberry into the coconut and stir it like you would batter, and then STOP. A few folds will do it. Chill another 10, and then pour that into the graham cracker crust to set up for the final freeze.Photo by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Alison Attenborough, Prop Styling by Heather Greene6 hours laterThe pie will be frozen enough to make sharp, servable slices. Especially if you run your knife under hot water and clean it in between slices.Photo by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Alison Attenborough, Prop Styling by Heather GreeneDecorate the sh*t out of itToss some strawberries in lemon juice and sugar and then spoon them into little divots on top of the pie. This is called extra credit, which you know is NOT optional for those with drive and ambition in life.Get the recipe:Coconut-Strawberry Ice Cream PieA swirled beauty of coconut and strawberry ice creams with a salted press-in graham cracker crust.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titIce CreamPieSummer DessertsStrawberryCoconutRecipes you want to make.
