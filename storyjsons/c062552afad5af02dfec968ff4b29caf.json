But one of those joys is biting into a peak-season, ultraripe, piece of summer fruit baked with a combination of flour, butter, and sugar. (Also vanilla ice cream. Always vanilla ice cream.)So is it a cobbler, or a crisp? And what exactly is a crumble?The differences, it turns out, are as confusing and debatable as the myriad definitions of sandwich. It\u2019s so regional that, as the New York Times\u2019 Kim Severson wrote in her 2013 deep-dive on cobblers, \u201cpeople within the same county will disagree on the proper form.\u201dAnd while getting in the middle of this debate sounds messier than sifting flour, we dove into our favorite baking cookbooks for a definitive answer on how they differ and what that means for your future bakes.Perfectly fluffy biscuits sit on top of this cherry cobbler.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Sue LiCobblerCobbler has been around in America the longest of the three desserts; the Oxford Companion to Food dates its inception back to the 1850s. By the mid-19th century, it had become the dish we know now: fruit baked in the oven with some form of dough. In 1859, cobbler was defined in John Russell Bartlett\u2019s Dictionary of Americanisms as: \u201cA sort of pie, baked in a pot lined with dough of great thickness, upon which the fruit is placed; according to the fruit, it is an apple or a peach cobbler.\u201d Well, John, that sounds like\u2026pie.But it turns out, that\u2019s what cobbler was during this period of American cooking. In 1881, Abby Fisher, an escaped slave who fled the South after the Civil War to San Francisco, published some of her recipes in What Mrs. Fisher Knows About Old Southern Cooking. In the cookbook, her peach cobbler uses pastry dough both underneath and on top. In many parts of the South, pastry dough is still used in cobblers, sometimes in that pie-like form, sometimes with the dough just on top.But as time went on, we began to associate cobbler with either having a biscuit topping, like a shortcake in large format, or more of a cake batter, which, as Severson also points out, is a style found at barbecue joints across the South.No matter your dough, the fruit can be swapped for whatever your heart desires. Here, we turned to the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen for advice. In the case of a cobbler, your best bet is to go with firmer fruits like cherries. As contributing food editor Claire Saffitz explained during the development of her Cherry Biscuit Cobbler recipe, the firmer the fruit, the longer it\u2019ll take to release its juices, which means the biscuits (or cake batter, or pastry) begin cooking through before they\u2019re sogged out with liquid.Try: Cherry Biscuit CobblerThis strawberry number has granola mixed into its topping.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Susie TheodorouCrispA crisp and a crumble are incredibly alike, the differences between them either argued over or discounted entirely, depending on where you turn. Regardless, the topping that sits on the baked fruit is crispy and crumbly. A crisp is \u201ca type of dessert consisting of fruit baked with a crumble topping,\u201d according to the Oxford English Dictionary\u2019s definition, citing an early use in a 1916 recipe for an apple crisp with a topping of butter, sugar, and flour that\u2019s mixed together by rubbing your fingertips \u201cuntil crumbly.\u201d Often, at least in the States, crisp and crumble are used interchangeably.Crisps didn\u2019t begin making appearances in America until the early 1900s. A June 1924 issue of Good Housekeeping references an apple crisp as part of an oven meal where every dish can be baked at the same temperature (the crisp at 400 degrees for 35 minutes, for what it\u2019s worth).In Baking: From My Home to Yours, queen baker Dorie Greenspan writes that a crisp \u201calways has butter and sugar and something to bind the two together, sometimes just flour, but often flour and oatmeal\u2014which gives the dessert a wonderfully pebbly look and great texture.\u201d It\u2019s all about that topping texture, and there\u2019s room to play around. A 1944 recipe for peach crisp in the New York Times uses corn flakes mixed with margarine and sugar for the topping\u2014yum. In 2017, we published a crisp recipe with spelt flour and oats over a plum-rosemary filling.Early crisp recipes were mostly apple, but now we\u2019re crisping everything we can get our hands on, even blueberries and corn. A crisp is where your very ripe fruit\u2014even overly ripe, bordering-on-mushy fruit\u2014comes in handy. The point is for the filling to release its juices so that they burble up and into the topping.Try: Strawberry-Granola CrispSesame seeds are studded in this sandy crumble.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Olivia Mack McCoolCrumbleA crumble is essentially a crisp, but it can have a slightly different texture. Greenspan\u2019s version includes chopped nuts, though many recipes stick with only butter, sugar, and flour, maybe with some warm spices like cinnamon or nutmeg. The topping might be sandier than a crunchy crisp, or have big clumps rather than an equally distributed crisp topping. Our new peach and sesame crumble recipe is somewhere in between the two with sesame seeds adding even more texture within the clumps.The Oxford Companion to Food says that \u201cit seems probable that [the crumble] was developed during the Second World War.\u201d The topping may have been inspired by streusels found in Austria and Central Europe, the topping for a rich tea bread or cake called streuselkuchen.The rule for choosing fruit for a crumble remains the same as with a crisp: Whether stone fruit or berries, it can\u2019t hurt them to be softer, as they need less time in the oven before the topping is cooked through and golden brown on top.So what\u2019s in a name? That which we call a cobbler by any other name would taste as damn good.Try: Peach and Sesame CrumbleExplore Bon App\u00e9titCobblerCrispCrumbleDessertRead MorecultureSummer Pies Should All Be Deep DishBy Alex BeggscookingThe Galette That Makes People Think I Work at Bon App\u00e9tit or SomethingBy Alex BeggscookingI Baked These Toffee Chocolate Chip Cookies With Half the Sugar and Loved ThemBy Sarah JampelcookingThis Plum Crumble (Prumble???)
