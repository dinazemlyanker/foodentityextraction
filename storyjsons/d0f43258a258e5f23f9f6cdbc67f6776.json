Fortunately for those sparkling water\u2013loving minimalists, PepsiCo is here with yet another option. This week, the beverage giant unveiled its brand-new line of \"Bubly\" sparkling water, which comes in cheerful, brightly colored cans decorated with rounded minimal text and cartoony bubbles in coordinating colors dotting either end of the can, perfect for the sophisticated seltzer seeker.According to a press release, each can features a \"unique smile\"\u2014differentiated by things like lipstick, mustaches, and stuck-out tongues\u2014and \"personal message\"\u2014\"I feel like I can be open around u,\" \"hold cans with me,\" and \"love at first phssst,\" among others\u2014on the side of the can, and a teeny greeting like \"hey u,\" \"hiii,\" or \"yo\" on the pop tab.  Inside each can is one of eight flavors: limebubly, grapefruitbubly, strawberrybubly, lemonbubly, orangebubly, applebubly, mangobubly, and cherrybubly. The entire line is all-natural, with no artificial flavors, no sweeteners, and no calories.\"We created bubly to provide consumers with a great-tasting, flavorful, unsweetened sparkling water in a fun, playful, and relevant manner that is unlike anything we've seen in the sparkling water category today,\" Todd Kaplan, vice president of PepsiCo's \"water portfolio,\" said in a statement. What, you don't have a water portfolio?PepsiCo's take on seltzer will be available in both the typical 12-ounce can, as well as 20-ounce bottles, and will hit grocery store shelves later this month. Bubly marks the latest expansion of the company's \"water portfolio,\" which began with the 2017 launch of LIFEWTR still bottled water. We're glad they've been consistent with the lack-of-vowels branding, otherwise, how would we know it's hip and modern? No word yet on a partnership with Michael Bubl\u00e9, but we'll wait.
