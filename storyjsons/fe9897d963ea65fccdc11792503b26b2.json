I resolved to write more, cook more, eat better. But I never could have predicted\u2026this.By Rachel KhongJuly 16, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Subin YangFacebookTwitterEmailOn New Year\u2019s Eve, with 2019 turning into 2020, my husband and I invited a small group of friends to our San Francisco apartment. It was only a few months ago, but if you\u2019d said it was a lifetime, I\u2019d believe it. Back then we shared snacks, hands hovered over the same platters of shrimp cocktail and deviled eggs. We blew those paper party blowers, curling and uncurling them into one another\u2019s face, sometimes setting them down and losing track of whose were whose. We picked them back up and blew them anyway. Among friends it hadn\u2019t mattered. We weren\u2019t thinking about germs. We didn\u2019t know yet to be thinking about germs.New Year\u2019s Eve parties can be long, so we decided to count down the new year in different time zones. I assigned friends to surprise us with a food or activity for Eastern, Central, and Mountain time. At 9:00 we ate apple cake that Michael had baked (for the Big Apple). At 10:00 we marched a second line down my small hallway, playing kazoos and festooned in the Mardi Gras beads Aku and Shane brought (New Orleans). At 11:00 we sipped cannabis cider from Meng and Neel (in honor of Colorado and its legalized weed).When it became 2020 in our time zone, we played \u201cAuld Lang Syne\u201d on our kazoos. I brought out long hoarded stationery and stamps (Mister Rogers, Disney villains) so we could write letters to our future selves, earnest or otherwise. We sat on the living room floor to write them. I promised I\u2019d send the letters in six months\u2014in June. As his return address, my friend Daniel wrote: \u201c2010s, SF, CA, USA, Earth.\u201dWriting a letter to myself, I anticipated a quiet year. I was, embarrassingly, at a loss: unable to imagine how my life might look different because I didn\u2019t have anything grand or spectacular planned. I wanted to finish the novel I\u2019ve been working on for a while now (currently titled \u201cNew Thing\u2014December 2016\u201d). I resolved to use my gym membership\u2014even the elaborate weight machines that intimidated me. I wanted to travel more, maybe to Hungary or Vietnam. And I wanted to cook and eat good food. The plan was to host dinner parties at our place one Sunday every month.Now I see what a failure of imagination that was. I expected that simply because I hadn\u2019t planned big things, big things were unlikely to happen. We had fun that night; the time had felt precious, singular. But none of us could have known that the simple act of gathering would become a thing to be missed. What we could have used, actually, was a letter from the future.I didn\u2019t know that only a few months later I\u2019d miss picking up an avocado, squeezing it, putting it down, picking up another avocado, squeezing that one, and then deciding on the first one I touched. I\u2019d miss forgetting something from my grocery list, then heading back to the store to get only that. I\u2019d miss bulk bins. I\u2019d miss picnics and dinner parties and restaurants. I\u2019d miss sitting too close to friends at a dive bar, yelling to be heard.At the time of this writing it\u2019s been nearly two months of sheltering in place. It\u2019s early May and I\u2019m still in possession of my friends\u2019 letters, waiting to send them in June. Writing this essay is an endeavor almost as absurd as writing a letter to oneself before a history-shifting pandemic. Because Bon Appe\u0301tit is a print magazine, you\u2019ll be reading this in August. (Or in the case of the digital version, late July.) So basically I\u2019m writing another letter to another future self, one who knows more than I do now, and certainly more than the person I was on January 1. When what I could really use is you telling me how things are panning out. (Do we have a vaccine, August people? Is yeast still weirdly hard to find?)Does life return to normal, reader of the future? Perhaps a bigger question is this: Was normal even good?In these uncertain times, when the only certainty seems to be the overuse of \u201cin these uncertain times,\u201d the fact that we have to cook, then eat, has been a dependably unchanging solace\u2014or an inconvenient necessity, depending on the day. Since mid-March I\u2019ve swung between two distinct poles when it comes to food. There are the meals I blissfully cook over hours\u2014chili pan mee with hand-cut noodles; hamburgers with buns I baked; idli fermented for days\u2014and then, on the other end of the spectrum, there are all the cans of sardines I\u2019ve eaten over the sink and more PB&Js than I can possibly quantify.Better represented than either extreme are all the meals in between: meals to use up limp celery, to finish the last of a box of a certain pasta shape, to polish off the half-cans of coconut milk. It\u2019s this in-between cooking that, on the best days, has felt like a bulwark against chaos. Trying to use every grocery and pantry item can be as satisfying as finishing a puzzle. Making stock from a bag of saved vegetable odds and ends. Turning old brittle rice into far more compelling fried rice by cooking it with ancient kimchi\u2014and learning that no kimchi is too old for this purpose! Here I\u2019ve finally achieved what I\u2019ve always aspired to: not wasting food. In a recent past life, I might have completely forgotten a bunch of cilantro and rediscovered it weeks later, in its new form: putrid brown slime. If I have cilantro these days, I think about it constantly, making a plan for every stem.And it\u2019s folly, of course, but I\u2019m wondering what will stick. I wonder if, like people who lived through wartimes or the Great Depression, we\u2019ll cook and behave differently after all this is a distant memory. I wonder if I\u2019ll never throw away a bone before making stock from it. I wonder if I\u2019ll never toss those infuriating tiny slivers of garlic you sometimes get in a head, painstakingly peeling each one instead, just in case I run out. I wonder if I\u2019ll always adapt the recipe to what I have rather than go all the way back to the store for one missing ingredient. I wonder if I\u2019ll stay vigilant about the very back of my refrigerator and keep eating expired condiments because actually, usually, they\u2019re totally fine. (Confession: I kind of like old ketchup. Darker, danker, umami-rich.)Does life return to normal, reader of the future? Perhaps a bigger question is this: Was normal even good? Or was normal actually complacency and negligence? Can our new habits\u2014the good ones, I mean\u2014become permanent? I don\u2019t want to go back to being the person who consumes blithely and lets cilantro rot.If I could tell my past self anything from the future, it would be that taking care trumps making plans and resolutions. The phrase \u201cin these uncertain times\u201d is redundant because every time is uncertain. We only delude ourselves, myopically, into believing it isn\u2019t. I want to tell future me that even if things haven\u2019t gone back to how they were, maybe that\u2019s not such a bad thing. Moving forward, maybe we can behave differently for the better\u2014with more care. Maybe we\u2019ll recognize our time with friends as the precious thing it\u2019s always been. Maybe we\u2019ll be more grateful for the farmers who grew our food and for the hands that brought it to us. Maybe we\u2019ll work toward equity, distributing food and other resources more fairly. That\u2019s my hope for myself, at least\u2014present and future selves included.Rachel Khong is the author of the novel Goodbye, Vitamin.Explore Bon App\u00e9titFirst PersonCoronavirusRecipes you want to make.
