Flatbread! Literally anything else!By Jesse SparksApril 24, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Pearl JonesFacebookTwitterEmailThis may be hard to hear, but the truth often is: It\u2019s okay not to make sourdough. This feels like a controversial take in the midst of the current sourdough stress-baking craze, but I mean it. Despite what your high school friends are saying in their IG lives, you don\u2019t have to make sourdough. You can make great bread without making sourdough at all.As an avid baker who has churned out a few loaves of sourdough myself, I understand the urge to want to bake along with others. After all, the sense of community that comes from baking with or for others is one of the best parts of the process, and when so many of us are trying to feel closer to our people, baking feels like a way to display affection from a distance. But all of those warm and fuzzies aren\u2019t null and void just because you\u2019re not making actual sourdough.What even is sourdough, exactly? These naturally-leavened breads (meaning, no baking powder, baking soda, or store-bought yeast) get their distinct tanginess from the starter, the combination of flour and water that becomes the home for a colony of wild yeast. The process of nurturing the starter and then harnessing its power to bake is a sensitive one that requires a lot of time, patience, and flour. Success hinges on the starter\u2019s health\u2014and about a million other factors. That\u2019s why many other breads use commercial leaveners to churn out consistent results. If you can find these (I know yeast is hard to come by these days), it\u2019s totally okay to take advantage. Sourdough bread isn\u2019t the only bread. Here are some of my favorites, no starter involved:Soda BreadA \u201csoda bread\u201d gets its lift from, you guessed it, baking soda. It can be a simple combination of baking soda, flour, buttermilk, and salt, or it can include sugar, butter, dried fruits, and seeds.Soda bread makes great toast.\nBeer BreadClassic beer bread channels the carbonation and flavor of beer to transform flour, sugar, and butter into a fluffy, slightly malty loaf. It\u2019s an ideal choice for those looking to cut down on the effort of sourdough while still getting a final product with a more complex flavor profile. To make it, all you have to do is mix the ingredients together and transfer the dough into a buttered loaf pan. (If you\u2019re looking for a recipe, I like this one from King Arthur Flour.) And while the ingredient ratios are pretty consistent, the recipe is forgiving enough to accommodate some slight tweaking.FlatbreadFlatbreads are a perfect alternative to more time- and ingredient-intensive recipes. Their beauty lies in how straightforward and almost foolproof they are. Because many are made without yeast (thanks, baking powder!), they come together quickly. Start with this caramelized zucchini flatbread and swap in whatever produce you might have on hand. You can even shower it with your favorite blend of herbs and spices to accompany any dinnertime dip situation.FocacciaIf you\u2019re looking for something that will deliver a feeling of huge accomplishment, consider turning to this no-knead focaccia. Although it requires yeast to deliver that fluffy, pillowy texture, it\u2019s still less labor-intensive than many other recipes. Once you\u2019ve mastered the recipe, you can start experimenting with toppings. To do so, you\u2019ll want to partially bake (a.k.a. parbake) your dough. Pull it out of the oven after 20 to 25 minutes, add what you'd like\u2014test kitchen editor Sohla El-Waylly loves adding cherry tomatoes, chunks of mozzarella, and shaved ribbons of zucchini\u2014and return it for the remainder of the cook time.Or take it one step further with pretzel focaccia.\nPhoto by Laura Murray, Food styling by Yekaterina BoystovaSandwich BreadWhile these recipes do require yeast, they're much lighter lifts than sourdough, delivering plush, slightly sweet loaves. Because sandwich bread isn't as potent as funky-tangy sourdough, it\u2019s also significantly more versatile. You\u2019ll be able to use it for toast, sandwiches (duh), French toast, bread puddings, croutons, and more. Start out with our go-to sandwich bread, this insanely soft milk bread, or a straight-forward honey whole-wheat loaf (I like this version from Bob\u2019s Red Mill).At the end of the day, it\u2019s the ~feeling~ and the nourishment of making bread that makes it so worthwhile\u2014not whether that loaf was leavened with yeast harvested from nature or packed up in a factory. So cash in on the feels and take selfies with your round bois! Just because they're not sour doesn't mean they don't deserve your love.Get baking:1 / 33ChevronChevronPumpkin Bread with Salted Maple ButterView RecipeRecipes you want to make.
