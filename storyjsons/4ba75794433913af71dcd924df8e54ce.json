In her monthly column, nearly lifelong vegetarian Sarah Jampel will tackle cooking, eating, and navigating the world meat-free\u2014even when her grandma still doesn't know what she makes for dinner.When I* was planning my wedding this past fall, I had only a few wishes: that my dress not be strapless; that we keep the first dance as short as possible; that we not be introduced as \u201cthe new Mr. and Mrs.\u201d; that no elderly relative take a tumble on the dance floor (it happens); that no one tell that story from when I was seven; that I not trip down the aisle; and, highest priority on the list, that no vegetarian guest be subjected to a \u201cveggie stack\u201d\u2014the sort of leaning tower of roasted vegetables that\u2019s often presented as the entree for herbivores.I got almost everything on my list. My dress had straps, and my 90-year-old grandma made it through the ceremony and the party, no face-to-floor contact. I did stumble down the aisle and, as painful as it is for me to admit, my vegetarian (and vegan, and gluten-free) friends and relatives were served a veggie stack. (For what it\u2019s worth, some told me they enjoyed it. Were they just being nice? A question I\u2019ll have to wrestle with forever!)Why did I want to avoid the veggie stack like the plague? At almost every large sit-down dinner I\u2019ve attended in my entire life, I\u2019ve opted out of the chicken, beef, and fish and been faced, instead, with a plate of vegetables cooked to varying degrees (raw, cooked, overcooked, somewhere between raw and overcooked I never thought was even possible) or a pasta primavera situation with floppy noodles, limp mushrooms, roasted red peppers, and a few sad thyme leaves.I don\u2019t mean to complain: I just mean to express how jealous I have been of my neighbors\u2019 roast chicken. Not because it\u2019s roast chicken but because it looks like a full, satisfying meal. It\u2019s not that a plate of roasted vegetables is the worst thing in the world\u2014it\u2019s just that it doesn\u2019t compare to chicken thighs plated with a mound of mashed potatoes and a pile of steamed green beans. (And don\u2019t get me started on the tofu \u201csteak.\u201d)Just to make sure I wasn\u2019t alone, I texted a few vegetarian friends the question \u201cWhat is the best/worst vegetarian entree you\u2019ve been served at a large event like a wedding?\u201d Friend one said, \u201cI don\u2019t like roasted vegetables\u201d; friend two said \u201cdef like a stack of grilled vegetables with nothing else on the plate\u201d (yes, I did point out that this was exactly what we served at our wedding); friend three didn\u2019t respond but I won\u2019t take it personally\u2014she\u2019s very busy. After that, I ran out of friends.It\u2019s so hard to come up with a non-pasta main that leaves vegetarians full but ready to dance. The way I usually eat at home\u2014various vegetables supplemented with a random protein-forward add-on like tempeh crumbles or spicy tofu or marinated lentils\u2014doesn\u2019t easily translate into a cohesive plated dish that a caterer can efficiently cook and serve.Our catering company, a truly excellent Baltimore institution, did present plenty of options: grilled tofu with stir-fried vegetables; chef\u2019s seasonal lasagnetta (yes, an individual-sized lasagna with winter squash and, inexplicably, craisins); and wild mushroom risotto. We\u2019ve already covered how I feel about tofu slabs, the lasagnetta tasted as weird as it sounded, and my mom ruled out risotto categorically, reasoning that there was no way it could be good (\u201cIt\u2019ll be gummy!\u201d she insisted. We never were able to prove her wrong).So we were left with the veggie stack.Being a food snob and a generally Compulsive Person, I pitched a few ideas to the caterer before the tasting: how about a warm grain salad, I piped up, with farro, seasonal vegetables, and cheese? Or a vegetarian galette, with cheese and roasted root vegetables? I even sent a reference photo, being the insufferable human being that I am. But when we arrived to taste our way through the menu (tip: you don\u2019t need to try the mashed potatoes with every entree if they\u2019re the same each time), we were presented, nevertheless, with the Vegetarian Napoleon \u201cTower,\u201d with no galette or grain salad in sight. That\u2019s 1 for grilled vegetables, 0 for Sarah Jampel.To find out what could I have done to avoid the Tower of Doom, I checked in with Jamie Erickson, the owner and creative director of Poppy\u2019s Catering in Brooklyn. She explained to me that Poppy\u2019s often recommends family-style meals in order to keep a wide range of guests happy: People can try a lot of different dishes, and vegetarians, in particular, have the opportunity to get something protein-y and something carb-y, along with plenty of vegetable sides. Poppy\u2019s spring menu options include olive oil-poached vegetables over herby pumpkin seed spread, turmeric couscous with chickpeas and leeks, pea shoot and radish salad with burrata, grilled za\u2019atar flatbread, asparagus and spring onions, and smashed new potatoes with snap peas. None of these would constitute a meal on its own, but that\u2019s the beauty of mix-and-match.For those forgoing family-style, there are options for vegetarian entrees besides the stack: herby polenta with spring vegetables and a poached egg, and a mushroom galette (yes, this was redeeming to learn, thanks for asking) with lovage pesto (can you even believe it?) and shaved comt\u00e9, both of which sound infinitely more appealing than a plate of roasted vegetables.If you can\u2019t find a caterer like Poppy\u2019s, you can still make moves to ensure vegetarian guests are happy and well-fed: Pick a lot of veg-friendly appetizers or devise some sort of cheese-dip-crudite station that your friends can graze on throughout the night. If none of that is a possibility, just remember this: Your friends and fam are ultimately there for you, not the food (meaning that you\u2019re more worried about it than they are). My friends who said that a pile of  grilled vegetables is the worst vegetarian wedding food? Neither remembered that that was exactly what we served at my wedding.And fellow vegetarians (or picky eaters), here\u2019s a word to the wise: It\u2019s okay\u2014smart, even\u2014to anticipate your hunger and have a snack beforehand (I even know some carnivores who pre-eat before veg-heavy events\u2014it goes both ways!). If that doesn\u2019t work out, locate a pizza place where you can stop on your way home. There\u2019s nothing quite like eating a slice in a tux or gown.*By \u201cI,\u201d I mean my mom.
