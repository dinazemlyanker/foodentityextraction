Come November, supermarket shelves across Puerto Rico hold all the classic components: cranberry sauce, stuffing, dinner rolls. The diaspora became accustomed to these items Stateside and brought them back to the island\u2014which could be how pavochon was born.\u201d Serve it with Maisonet\u2019s Cornbread and Salami Dressing. Note: Achiote paste is essential for getting a deep burnished color and extra rich flavor all over the turkey.Ingredients8 - 10 Servings112\u201314-lb. whole turkey, neck and giblets removed, patted dry1lemon, halvedKosher salt, freshly ground pepper3Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature\u00bccup extra-virgin olive oil3Tbsp. achiote (annatto) paste2Tbsp. dried oregano2Tbsp. granulated garlic2tsp. ground cumin1large onion, halved5garlic cloves2celery stalksPreparationStep 1Using your fingers, gently separate skin from breast meat starting at neck. Rub outside of turkey all over with cut sides of lemon; set lemon aside. Season inside and out all over with salt and pepper (be generous with the salt). Rub butter over breast meat underneath skin.Step 2Mash oil, achiote paste, oregano, granulated garlic, and cumin in a small bowl to a smooth paste. Rub an even layer all over outside of turkey. Tie legs together with kitchen twine. Let sit at room temperature 2 hours, or set on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet and chill, uncovered, up to 2 days.Step 3If chilled, let turkey sit at room temperature 1 hour before roasting.Step 4Place a rack in bottom third of oven; preheat to 450\u00b0. Place onion, garlic, celery, and reserved lemon inside turkey cavity. Place turkey in a large roasting pan on top of a flat or V-shaped wire rack. Pour 1\u00bd cups water into pan. Roast turkey, rotating once if it is browning unevenly, until skin is browned all over and beginning to crisp, 25\u201330 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0 and continue to roast turkey, basting with pan juices every 30 minutes, adding more water by \u00bd-cupfuls if completely evaporated, and rotating pan if browning unevenly, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breasts registers 150\u00b0\u2013155\u00b0 and thickest part of thighs registers 165\u00b0\u2013170\u00b0, about 1\u00bd hours longer. Transfer turkey to a cutting board; let rest 30\u201360 minutes before carving. (If making gravy, deglaze pan and use drippings.)How would you rate Pavochon?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (3)Back to TopTriangleHard to believe that two professional chefs didn't know to remove pinfeathers BEFORE cooking.\n\ud83d\ude44TWAV8Rcoastal Alabama11/21/2021This was awesome! I halved the recipe and made it with a 5.5 lb. chicken.  Next time, I'll make the Turkey with some smoke chips on my Weber charcoal grille.  I found that I needed more oil in the rub.  It was very clumpy and hard to put on the bird in an even layer.  RonPReston, VA3/15/2021I made this turkey for Thanksgiving and it was sooo good!! Easy too! I love eating the leftovers cold from the fridge with my bare hands like a lunatic, it's that good. Just get the softest achiote paste you can find, mine was kinda hard so I had some big pieces of achiote on my turkey, or make the paste in a food processor so that it's homogeneous. Great recipe 10/10Laura ETijuana, M\u00e9xico12/5/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titPuerto RicanCaribbeanTurkeyPoultryMainNut-FreeGluten-FreeKetoRoastThanksgivingDinnerRecipes you want to make.
