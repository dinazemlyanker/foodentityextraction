Today, a mix of Hollywood celebrities, tourists who come to ogle at celebrities, and dedicated locals keep the red leather booths full. The bar, a compact one-man operation, continues to divide the restaurant into two important parts: If you would love to be seen and you don\u2019t mind the noise, you sit toward the front. If you\u2019re very famous and fierce about your privacy, you sit in the other room. Either way, Gotovac keeps the drinks flowing.Need a drink? Ask Mike Gotovac.\nWhat was Dan Tana\u2019s like when you started working there?We were open \u2019til 11 o\u2019clock and medium busy. Then in the mid-\u201970s, Troubadour [the legendary West Hollywood rock club] started having big shows. The [crowd from the Troubadour] needed someplace to eat after the last show, which was at 10 o\u2019clock. They asked the owner of Dan Tana\u2019s to stay open until one. So the place just became busy. Every night we were packed.Did you stay open past close?Do I say that? Do I talk about that? In the old days we did until five or six o\u2019clock in the morning. There was no service, but we would sit and talk, have a few drinks. Those days are gone. We were so crazy one night, we chartered two small planes and flew to Vegas after we closed. My wife called the police looking for me.Have the drinks changed?They change by generation. When I first started working, it was all gin martinis, Rob Roys, and Manhattans. Nobody drank wine. Now it\u2019s everything vodka martinis. Now they drink more wine. Back then people would get Brandy Alexanders, the Golden Cadillac. Thank god nobody orders that anymore. It\u2019s very messy, with the eggs and cream.Dan Tana's (and its legendary neon signage) has been around since 1968.\nPhoto by Alex LauWhat do you like to drink?I drink brandy and wine. I tell people I mix drinks in my stomach, not in my glass.Do you keep a limit on your drinks?Well, there\u2019s no limit, you know. You either drink or you don\u2019t drink. Thank god now for Uber. Now there are 40 to 50 Ubers lined up on weekend nights. Before, you had to take keys from a lot of people\u2014there would be ten different keys behind the bar. So I drove customers home myself.Do you have a favorite seating?It\u2019s my job to like every customer. You gotta be nice to everybody, take care of everybody, make sure everybody is happy with the food and drink and nobody bothers anyone else. And don\u2019t let anyone go to the tables by the movie stars!When it comes to red sauce, it doesn't get more iconic than this place.\nPhoto by Alex LauOh, do you ever have to intervene when people crowd the movie stars?You\u2019re busy, so you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on between every meal. But yeah, we stop people right away. It happens in every place, but we never allow that here. That\u2019s why they\u2019re happy coming in: because we protect them.You\u2019ve got double duty as a bodyguard?Yeah, the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 and I, but most people respect us. They listen to us. Once in awhile someone gets nasty, and we\u2019ll just tell them to leave. And we have customers who\u2019ve been coming in for years\u2014third and fourth generation\u2014so if someone gives us a hard time they jump in right away: \u201cHey, you gotta leave!\u201d Our long-time customers have our back.Maggie Lange is a writer in Los Angeles, who still hasn't adjusted away from Eastern Standard Time.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsItalian AmericanRed SauceLos AngelesRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
