It\u2019s the single most essential ingredient in your kitchen. The biggest mistake people make when cooking is not using enough of it. So on and so forth.By this point, then, you know to salt your pasta water with a heavy hand. And maybe you know to salt your potato water until it has reached ocean-levels of salinity, too. But today we\u2019re here to talk about the importance of salting your tomatoes.Tomatoes are different than pasta and potatoes, of course. They\u2019re not dense carbs that taste like absolutely nothing unless they\u2019re properly seasoned. So why, you might wonder, is a generous sprinkle necessary? Why\u2014especially when tomatoes are at peak-season ripeness and taking a bite of one almost feels like eating a Gusher\u2014must you do more?There are two reasons. One, as senior food editor Molly Baz put it, is that \u201csalt makes food taste more like itself.\u201d This is particularly useful when tomatoes are used in a recipe with a lot else going on. Take this Fancy and Beautiful Tomato Salad, for example. Tomatoes are the star, but there are other intense flavors making moves, too. Herbs, lemon, za\u2019atar, and feta are all fighting for your attention, so you want your tomatoes to be their most tomato-y selves in order to stand out. The salt actually highlights the tomatoes\u2019 sweetness by acting as a foil. Think about it: That\u2019s why there\u2019s salt in nearly every baked good. In the case of tomatoes, the salt is also drawing water out, intensifying the fruits\u2019 natural flavors.In this ultimate caprese, the tomatoes are generously sprinkled with salt. Amen!\nLaura MurrayThe second reason to salt tomatoes is for tomato juice.  In some cases, like with eggplant, zucchini, or cucumber, the liquid that salt draws out is remnant of murky water and can go. All you want is the veg itself, primed for caramelizing, frying, or smashing.But tomato juice is delicious and should be just as prized as the tomato itself. Just like when you're macerating berries in a bit of sugar and salt, the liquid becomes part of the dish. In that tomato salad, it mingles with the dressing, marinates the feta, and coats the pita chips until they become gloriously crispy-gone-soggy.So what are you waiting for? Stop reading this article (oh look, it's nearly done!), go buy some glorious summer tomatoes, and salt away.Tomato time:Fancy and Beautiful Tomato SaladHere\u2019s the first thing you should make when you want to show off the peak-season tomatoes you\u2019ve been waiting all year for.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titTomatoRead MorecookingThese 2 Ingredients Make Even Mediocre Berries Taste IrresistibleBy Molly BazRecipes you want to make.
