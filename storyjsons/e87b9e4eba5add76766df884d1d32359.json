See our past recommendations here!My love affair with these perfectly chewy, chocolate-covered vegan candy bars started in the usual way: an Instagram doomscroll stopped in its tracks, followed by an impulsive shipment of all four flavors, and the fluttery suspense before meeting in person.Unlike internet dating, Gigantic did not disappoint in real life: the Salted Peanut\u2014filled with coconut milk caramel(!), studded with toasty nuts, and dipped in fair-trade dark chocolate\u2014tastes much like a Snickers. The Banana Pecan is ripe and rich like fresh banana bread, the Almond Horchata is unimaginably cinnamony, and the Hazelnut Cafe, as one reviewer put it, is \u201ca healthy alternative to eating a jar full of Nutella.\u201dNow, in the rubble of life lessons hard-won is this one: What at first seems good for me is quite often the opposite. In life and confectionary, crushes can be fickle. So, it was with a good amount of skepticism that I put my first batch of Gigantic bars to the test\u2014I asked myself, Is this relationship sustainable in the long run?\u2014before offering them a permanent place in my fridge.The answer was, shockingly, yes. With only 7 grams per serving, Gigantic\u2019s \u201csorta sweet\u201d bars are incredibly low in sugar\u2014without relying on gross-tasting artificial sweeteners. For comparison, a Mars bar clocks in at 60 g. And because the sweetness\u2014which primarily comes from small amounts of brown and cane sugars\u2014isn\u2019t as heady, the other flavors are more pronounced. More peanut. More hazelnut. More banana. No games, just the real deal.I\u2019d be lying if I said that Gigantic\u2019s attractive retro packaging wasn\u2019t part of the appeal. It\u2019s reminiscent of old-school candy, rather than something you\u2019d find in the health food aisle, which founder Stu Davidoff says was by design. So your life partner happens to be super cute? Bonus!By now Gigantic and I are way past that fling thing. This Valentine\u2019s Day, you\u2019ll find my boyfriend and me enjoying a \u2018chocluterie\u2019 platter of all four flavors. We\u2019ll slice a variety pack into cubes, then laze about on the couch popping them into each others\u2019 mouths like we\u2019re two gods in a Botticelli painting. It actually sounds sorta sweet, right?Variety Pack of Candy Bars$28 at Gigantic!Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingCandyHealthyish Loves ItChocolateHealthyishRead MorecultureThe Best Chocolates to Buy Online Right NowBy MacKenzie Chung FeganRecipes you want to make.
