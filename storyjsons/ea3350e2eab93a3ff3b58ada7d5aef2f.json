The ratios of ingredients are perfect. The only thing I couldn't bring myself to do was cook the honey that long. I filtered out the ginger and stirred the honey into the hot ginger-infused water and it worked marvelously.AnonymousDetroit1/5/2019It sounds delicious but one thing to keep in mind is that when you boil honey you lose all the benefits of honey. So maybe that could be part of the second step as usually honey will combine easy with hot water. In India they won\u2019t even add honey to hot tea as they believe honey\u2019s healing properties are compromised even in hot water.
