Get ready to carbo-load.By Alex DelanyJune 5, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailThe working title for this article was Big-Ass Pasta. You didn\u2019t need to know that, but we think it\u2019s probably more fun if you do. What you do need to know is that this article is, in fact, about large pasta. Huge pasta. Pasta that is remarkably sized. Pasta is life, and this pasta is larger than life.Serving up super-sized versions of shapes you already know (or shapes that are completely new to your pasta experience) is an easy way to make your dishes more visually impressive, with zero extra work. But of all the oversized pastas, there are some that reign supreme. These are the massive pasta shapes that hold a special spot in out hearts...and on our forks.Photo by Chelsie CraigManicottiYeah, yeah. You know about manicotti already, but it\u2019s so good that you\u2019re probably fine with hearing about it again. Stuffing these long tubes with ricotta, smothering them in marinara sauce, and baking them until they bubble is a surefire way to any human being\u2019s heart. There\u2019s also a type of homemade manicotti that\u2019s made with sheets of crepe-like pasta. Need a recipe for that? We\u2019ve got you.Buy some manicotti shells for $2 at WalmartPhoto by Chelsie CraigPennoniIf you\u2019re thinking, oh this looks like giant penne, congrats. You\u2019re right. Pennoni is a blown-up version of penne that comes in both ridged and smooth varieties. We love the ridges for grabbing onto meat sauces, like a classic bolognese. And we like the smooth stiff for a classic carbonara.Buy some pennoni for $13 at JetPhoto by Chelsie CraigLumaconi GigantiYou know what\u2019s cool about lumaconi? They\u2019re named after snails. Lumaca means snail in Italian. That\u2019s a fun fact for you to use at parties. No charge. All yours to use. Lumaconi giganti are also all yours to use with pastas with chunks of vegetables in the sauce. They\u2019re neat to tuck into those snail-shaped shells.Buy some lumaconi giganti for $3 at BrandlessPhoto by Chelsie CraigFusilli GigantiThis monster-sized fusilli looks less like pasta and more like those giant drills they use to make tunnels. But instead of drilling into dirt and rocks, how about you drill into a large lake of pesto? Or maybe some romesco sauce? Those seem a lot more flavorful than dirt.Buy some fusilli gigante for $15 at JetPhoto by Chelsie CraigPaccheriThe negative space in the center of these large, smooth tubes looks awesome when plated on a giant platter with some meaty sauce or in this pork and beans pasta. Think of paccheri as a way to pack a bunch of rag\u00fa into a pasta suitcase. You fill them up with sauce and roll them right into your mouth. Bon voyage. Have a great trip.Buy some paccheri for $9 on AmazonYou know what\u2019s good with any shape of pasta?Fettuccine AlfredoA fettuccine Alfredo recipe should never include cream; the silky sauce comes from an emulsion of grated Parmesan, melted butter, and starchy pasta water.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPastaShoppingRecipes you want to make.
