Zuni Caf\u00e9's whole roasted chicken is world-famous for good reason: It really is that good.ORDER THE: chicken with bread salad, mustard greens, currants, and pine nuts. The bread has that coveted dual texture: It's crunchy from hanging out in the wood-fired brick oven but also a little mushy after soaking up all the chicken juices. It's heaven. While you wait for your chicken, which can take up to an hour, share the Zuni Caesar salad (a fine example of the genre) and a plate of the shoestring potatoes.THE VIBE IS: a little bit old-school but never stuffy. The waitstaff is relaxed and friendly, but it does feel like you're dining in a place with some history\u2014and that's a good thing. There are several different rooms to sit in within the triangular building, but we're partial to the small upstairs room where you can peek in on the open kitchen downstairs.PRACTICAL STUFF:  Open for lunch and dinner: Tuesday to Thursday, from 11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m.; Friday and Saturday; from 11:30 a.m. to midnight; and Sunday, from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Closed on Mondays.\u2014Carey PolisEric WolfingerWE ALSO LOVEState Bird ProvisionsDim sum with a Michelin twist\u2014don't miss the signature quail Swan Oyster DepotSuper-fresh seafood in Nob Hill, hold the attitudeLa TaqueriaLine up for the ultimate Mission burritoExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
