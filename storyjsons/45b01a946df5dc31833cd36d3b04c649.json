Co-working spaces haven\u2019t been spared, and the freelancers who relied on them for desk space and other resources have been left adrift. But it\u2019s not just an internet connection that they\u2019re losing: many of these spaces also functioned as community centers and support networks for people who need them most.Ethel\u2019s Club in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is one of those spaces. The social and wellness club for people of color has offered work space but also discussion groups, performances, classes, and other gatherings\u2014all led by POC\u2014to its over 200 members since it opened last year.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Amid the global pandemic, Ethel\u2019s Club\u2019s founder Naj Austin has closed the brick and mortar space and pivoted to a virtual model. \u201cIn the midst of so much unknown and constant change, we wanted to create an easy way for people to establish a sense of calm and normalcy in their lives,\u201d she says. \u201cOur answer is to reinforce daily routines and make the communal rituals and social practices that we\u2019re familiar with as accessible as possible.\u201dEthel\u2019s Club\u2019s new virtual membership is now available nationwide, with content streaming daily through Zoom and on Vimeo. The programming will keep the current health crisis in mind, offering breathwork practices to combat anxiety, for example; but it will also remain broad, with lectures on the history of hip-hop to the backdrop of a DJ set and introductions to BDSM and cannabis.\u201cIt\u2019s imperative to create a space where [people of color] can gather as one, hold space for our fears and hopes, heal, and ultimately create new futures as a community,\u201d Austin says. She stresses the importance of creating an ecosystem that\u2019s not only suited to virtual life but also financially supports the freelancers, artists, and entrepreneurs whose livelihoods are at risk right now.Whether or not you have access to a community like Ethel\u2019s Club, Austin says, consistency and connectivity is the key to keeping each other uplifted and empowered through this intense time. That means keeping in touch with loved ones with regular Facetime dates and phone calls that are less about what\u2019s in the headlines and more about checking in with people\u2019s emotional states. Instead of passing along news, \u201coffer a personal connection, a Netflix recommendation, or a calming way to meditate,\u201d Austin says. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been granted this time to slow down a bit, let\u2019s embrace it.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishBrooklynInterviewsRead MoreLifestyleWe Could All Use This Therapist's Advice Right NowBy Priya KrishnaRecipes you want to make.
