Owner Brent Kroll (along with his partners, somms Niki Lang and Daniel Runnerstorm) curate a far-reaching list, which includes a different theme every month (i.e. anything but Pinot Grigio in the summer, Friendsgiving wines in November, mountain-grown \"slope\" wines in January). Sounds a bit hokey, but it's not.ORDER THE: half pours or half bottles to try as many wines as possible. You don't have to be subjected to Wrath of the 5-Ounce Pour. Here, you've got options.THE VIBE IS: cozy neighborhood wine bar that hits just the right amount of cool. But it has all the familiar wine bar suspects: a charcuterie board, roasted nuts, and burrata, among other seasonal food options.THE NITTY-GRITTY: Open at 5 p.m. every day until midnight (Friday and Saturday until 1 a.m.). Show up early and you might get a free pour of sweet vermouth.Courtesy of Maxwell ParkExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
