Inspired by a Basque version, this is the cheesecake that wants to get burnt, cracked, and cooked at high heat. Which also means this is the cheesecake that\u2019s impossible to mess up.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Butter pan, then line with 2 overlapping 16x12\" sheets of parchment, making sure parchment comes at least 2\" above top of pan on all sides. Because the parchment needs to be pleated and creased in some areas to fit in pan, you won\u2019t end up with a clean, smooth outer edge to the cake; that\u2019s okay! Place pan on a rimmed baking sheet.Step 2Beat cream cheese and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-low speed, scraping down sides of bowl, until very smooth, no lumps remain, and sugar has dissolved, about 2 minutes.Step 3Increase speed to medium and add eggs one at a time, beating each egg 15 seconds before adding the next. Scrape down sides of bowl, then reduce mixer speed to medium-low. Add cream, salt, and vanilla and beat until combined, about 30 seconds.Step 4Turn off mixer and sift flour evenly over cream cheese mixture using a fine-mesh sieve. Beat on low speed until incorporated, about 15 seconds. Scrape down sides of bowl (yet again) and continue to beat until batter is very smooth, homogenous, and silky, about 10 seconds.Step 5Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake cheesecake until deeply golden brown on top and still very jiggly in the center, 60\u201365 minutes.Step 6Let cool slightly (it will fall drastically as it cools), then unmold. Let cool completely. Carefully peel away parchment from sides of cheesecake. Slice into wedges and serve at room temperature, preferably with a glass of sherry alongside.Do Ahead: Cheesecake be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Be sure to let cheesecake sit for several hours at room temperature to remove chill before serving.Step 7Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensHow would you rate Basque Burnt Cheesecake?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (172)Back to TopTriangleAmazing, \nI added a smidgen more sugar and vanilla to mine, but the flavor of the caramelization of the outer part is what does it for me, and the texture is amazing.\nDo not put anything with it except a glass of wine. No berries, no chocolate sauce. Let it stand on its own.MarcIndianapolis 3/24/2022I\u2019ve made this recipe twice. The first time, I served later in the day and it was very light. I found that it has a different consistency when you eat it at room temp/warm or cold from the fridge. The second time I made it, I let it cool for about an hour then stuck it in the fridge about two hours before dinner. Served some fresh strawberries with it. Everyone loved it and even had a second slice. The next day, we went out to dinner and my boyfriend\u2019s parents couldn\u2019t wait to finish dinner and eat the leftover cheesecake.AnonymousPhiladelphia, PA3/13/2022I have used this recipe several times and love the outcome everytime. Crustless, hint of sweetness and creamy. It is everything a Burnt Basque cheesecake should be. Every bite makes you want another slice. This is my all time favorite type of cheesecake to make. Simple, easy and perfect everytime.Mimi LimPhiladelphia, PA2/23/2022First of all, my home was filled with a delightful aroma while baking. This cheesecake has a subtle vanilla flavor and very creamy texture. The caramelization gives depth to the cheesecake's flavor.  Simply delicious!Kate GBuffalo, NY2/16/2022i used a little south american trick and mixed 1tbs dark rum with a little lemon zest and let it sit for a few minutes before adding it into the mix, it really brightened up the flavor and helped cut through all the fat and add some complexity! i know its not traditional but i feel it is my latina right to ignore the traditions of the spaniards and make my own instead AnonymousBoston, MA2/4/2022I can't wait to try this recipe out based on these reviews, but a question if I need to travel with the cheesecake; can I wait to unmold it right before serving, or do I need to put it on a serving plate? How long can I chill it in the fridge?RawanRamallah1/10/2022My new go to Cheesecake! Very simple, creamy and delicious. Very good recipe. Teresita Meadows1/9/2022I made this for Christmas for the first time. It was absolutely perfect. Even better the next day after it had been refrigerated. Molly was right. So so simple. STNiagara Falls, Ontario12/28/2021First time newbies making out first Basque cheesecake. Definitely easy to make. Creamy and delicious. We couldn't wait for it to cool, ate it warm. But it tasted better after being refrigerated. Excited to be able to make this again.  ShareToronto, canada12/14/2021I finally made this famed cheesecake, and funnily enough, it tasted somewhat like the Russian omelet. Interesting but very pleasant, it practically melts in your mouth. A very easy dessertHyeriCalifornia12/12/2021Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit! Absolutely delicious.BethPlymouth, MA11/27/2021Made this twice. Absolutely the best cheesecake I\u2019ve ever eaten. This time I used turbinado sugar instead of white and added a splash of bourbon. Can\u2019t wait!David AndersonNavarre Florida 10/31/2021Love love love this recipe and so does everyone I've made it for. My question is can this recipe be frozen, if so is it just as good afterwards.\nMaryNew Zealand10/23/2021I made this for a potluck at work and it was the best cheesecake ever! The Caramelized top was decadent! I baked it at 30% steam in my steam oven on convection heat at 400 degrees F. It was so light and creamy. The dark brown top and the creamy interior made such a beautiful presentation! This recipe will forever be my go-to Cheesecake recipe, so simple and easy to make.KateSeattle, WA10/19/2021Alright, so I changed this up a lot, in order to treat myself for my birthday. I veganized it, using miyokos cream cheese and just egg, with coconut milk for the dairy substitute. You might be thinking, WTF, she\u2019s INSANE, but all I have to say is\u2026.this was INSANELY good. Like everyone else, I checked in at 50 minutes, and it was juuussst beginning to brown. The center looked okay, though. So I turned on the broiler on low  for another 10 minutes or so, and it was beautiful. The coconut flavor was not too pronounced, and even when you did catch a hint, it was a lovely combo with the cake.  I served it with fresh berries and peaches on the side, and yes, I ate it for breakfast on my birthday.
