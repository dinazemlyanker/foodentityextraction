In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the noodles, stirring a few times to prevent sticking, until very al dente, about 6 minutes. Drain.Meanwhile, wrap the thawed spinach in a clean kitchen towel and wring out as much excess liquid as possible. Transfer to a medium bowl and combine with the ricotta, parmesan, 1 teaspoon of salt, and \u00bc teaspoon of pepper.Heat oil in a 10-inch high-sided ovenproof skillet over medium-high. Add the beef and season with salt and pepper; break up into small pieces with a wooden spoon and cook, turning a few times, until the meat is browned, about 8 minutes.Drain excess fat from the skillet and scrape the browned beef into a large heatproof bowl. Set aside 1 \u00bd cups of Rao\u2019s Homemade Marinara sauce and stir the remaining marinara into the bowl with the browned beef.Using the same skillet, (do not return to the heat) spread about 1 cup of the sauce mixture in a thin layer at the bottom of the skillet. Arrange a third of the noodles over the sauce, breaking the noodles up to fit if necessary, and spread half of the remaining sauce mixture over the noodles. Dollop with half of the spinach-ricotta mixture and sprinkle with a third of the mozzarella. Repeat layering one time with another third of the noodles, the remaining half of the sauce mixture, the remaining half of the spinach-ricotta mixture and another third of the mozzarella.Top lasagna with the remaining third of the noodles and spread the reserved marinara sauce over the top. Sprinkle with the remaining third of the mozzarella and bake lasagna until golden and bubbly, about 25 minutes.Let sit 10 minutes before serving. Sprinkle with parmesan.Recipe by Rao\u2019s Homemade\u00aeReviews SectionReviewsWrite a review\u2026GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for the Bon App\u00e9titNewsletterSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyExplore Bon App\u00e9titRao\u2019s Homemade\u00aeSponsoredMore from Bon App\u00e9titRecipes6 Pro Chefs Reveal Their \"Secret Weapon\" Ingredients2022-03-02T17:00:00.000ZrecipePorcini Gnocchi With Butter Sauce2022-03-15T09:00:00.000ZrecipeWhiskey Sour2020-12-16T18:20:00.000ZBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
