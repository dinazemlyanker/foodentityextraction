From tart berry pies in the summer to warmly spiced pumpkin and sweet potato in the fall, I\u2019d probably bake myself a pie a week if it weren\u2019t for the laborious process of preparing and chilling and rolling out pie dough. Which is why more and more often I\u2019ve found myself abandoning roll-out pastry and opting for low-maintenance press-in crusts instead.You\u2019re likely no stranger to press-in pie crusts. From crushed graham crackers to ground mixed nuts to crumbly buttery shortbread-style p\u00e2te sucr\u00e9e, the world of press-in pie crusts is vast and varied. What they all have in common, though, is they allow you to set the rolling pin aside and choose a faster, more reliable and intuitive tool: your hands. Assembling the dough can be as simple as mixing up your ingredients with melted butter and pressing it into a pie pan or tart tin.Next time you\u2019re making a pumpkin pie, opt for a crumbled biscoff cookie base\u2014you won\u2019t miss the traditional roll-out pie crust when warm ginger snappy flavors are front and center. Experiment with savory and sweet by mixing in saltines or Ritz crackers into your pie crust; you can even consider a handful of cheese crackers in the mix for a cheddar-and-apple-pie moment. Instead of covering your precious stone fruit and berries with a time-intensive laborious lattice, opt for a press-in tart crust that\u2019s crisp, light, sweet, and just as buttery. Rolled oats, shredded coconut, and spices are all welcome to the party too.To be fair, press-in pie dough is not a one-to-one swap. You will miss out on the flakiness that comes from properly mixed pie dough, where large pieces of butter release steam in the oven to create air pockets. But there\u2019s joy to be had in a press-in crust\u2019s buttery, crumbly, meltingly short texture; there\u2019s opportunity to incorporate additional flavors; and there\u2019s less of a chance of getting a massive headache from trying to roll out finicky dough when a family member is breathing hot air down your neck.The crust for this cranberry-lime pie is a mix of ginger snaps and pecans.\u00a0\nPhoto by BOBBI LINLike traditional pie dough, you may likely need to parbake your crust, which can take a little planning ahead. In her debut cookbook Life Is What You Bake It, Vallery Lomas writes that the best rule of thumb is to consider the amount of moisture in your filling. Parbaking\u2014a fancy word for giving the empty crust shell a headstart in the oven\u2014\u201cis used when a filling is so liquidy that it might make the crust soggy before it\u2019s had a chance to firm up in the oven, like a sweet potato pie,\u201d writes Lomas. So for custard-based pie fillings, pumpkin and sweet potato included, you\u2019ll want to prick your pie shell and bake\u2014sometimes loaded up with pie weights, depending on the nature of the recipe\u2014until the crust firms up. But even with this step, turning to a press-in crust is still loads easier than wrestling with your rolling pin.Consider this permission to give up on roll-out pie dough this year. When you\u2019re in a pinch, say fretting over preparing the dessert you volunteered to bring to Friendsgiving or hurriedly trying to pull together a showstopping pie to round out Christmas dinner, do you really need the added stress? A press-in pie crust doesn\u2019t require painstakingly incorporating butter, guessing about hydration levels, or whipping out the ruler and squinting to see what \u215b\" looks like. And that pumpkin or apple pie will be just as tasty.Press to ImpressSalted Caramel\u2013Chocolate TartWe can't stop staring at the layers of bittersweet ganache and buttery caramel.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
