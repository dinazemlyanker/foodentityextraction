You can adjust the amount of water added to create something thicker and dippable for crudit\u00e9s or thinner and drizzly for tossing into salads.IngredientsMakes about 3 cups1cup creamy natural peanut butter\u00bccup fresh lime, orange, or lemon juice4oz. silken or soft tofu1Tbsp. soy sauce2Tbsp. honey or maple syrup, plus more for drizzling12\" piece ginger, peeled, finely gratedKosher salt\u00bccup unsalted roasted pumpkin seeds (pepitas), chopped unsalted dry-roasted peanuts, hemp seeds, or chia seeds (for serving; optional)PreparationStep 1Combine peanut butter, lime juice, tofu, soy sauce, and 2 Tbsp. honey in a blender.

I add to add almost 3/4 c of hot water, probably because the pnut butter was pretty solid.  I also wanted it as a dressing, not a dip, to serve on a lettuce, carrot, celery, and green onion salad with marinated tofu and chopped peanut garnish.  It tasted great!!!CaseyRockbridge Baths VA2/20/2021Just finished making this and nearly sliced my fingers trying to lick the blender clean. SO GOOD! I didn't bother juicing the ginger, just chucked the 2\" nub right in along with a tsp of red chili flakes and a big clove of garlic. Needed a bit more than 1/4 C hot water to get the mixture going, but it whipped up silky and creamy. I'm going to serve it with tons of veggies and I'm sure my friends will end up drinking it!AnonymousCalgary, Alberta7/17/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSalad DressingSaladCrudit\u00e9ThaiSoutheast AsianAsianIndonesianTofuOther IngredientsLimeCitrusFruitGingerHerbs & SpicesSideRecipes you want to make.
