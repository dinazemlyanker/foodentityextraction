The phenomenon is called the Baader-Meinhof effect or \u201cfrequency illusion,\u201d and it happens to me all the time. On most occasions, it feels like a funny coincidence, but when it happened with the CDN TM8 Timer, it felt like divine intervention at play.I was wandering through the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen, seeing what scraps of recipe testing I could scrounge, when I spotted this little white timer propped up at senior food editor Anna Stockwell\u2019s station. Next to her, clipped to senior food editor Chris Morocco\u2019s apron, I saw it too. There it was again, in the distance, magnetized to the fridge door.\u201cThis is the best inexpensive kitchen timer,\u201d Chris said, swiftly unclipping it from his apron to show me the specs up close. \u201cThe buttons are large and easy to press, the count up and count down features make it incredibly helpful, and it\u2019s cheap.\u201dStockwell echoed the joys of the TM8 Timer. \u201cWhen using it for cooking and baking, it counts down to zero, rings for a minute\u2014a decent loudness you can hear in a busy kitchen\u2014and then counts up until you turn it off so you know how much time has elapsed. It has a memory feature so that when you bake batches of something, like cookies, you set the memory to, say, 12 minutes, and use the memory function each time. You can also add extra minutes to your set time if your bake is not quite done.\u201dIt\u2019s also durable, moisture-resistant, and definitely less nerve-wracking to have around a pot of boiling water than a smartphone. Plus, it\u2019s likely a lot more versatile than the timers built into your appliances. With features like the ability to track multiple things at once and longer ranges, with a clip for wearing, a fold away stand for propping up, and a built-in magnet for mounting, the petite piece of plastic will become your handy sidekick.But our Test Kitchen editors aren\u2018t the only CDN TM8 Timer stans. I saw it attached to an espresso machine at a coffee shop near my house, and the next day, in action at a chain coffee establishment (it rhymes with Shmarbucks) near the office. Barista friends of mine vouch they use it for all their coffee and tea brewing needs.Now that you know to look for it, you\u2019ll start to see it everywhere too, I guarantee it. But the place I\u2019ve become the most delighted to find it is in my own kitchen.
