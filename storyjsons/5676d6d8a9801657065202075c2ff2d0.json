In its frozen-dessert form, it\u2019s made without egg yolks so that the pure flavor of the sweet cream can shine. If you have a gelateria in your neighborhood, get a couple of pints to go. If not, use vanilla ice cream and your imagination. Serve these sundaes alongside a picnic menu of beef sliders, shrimp empanadas, and grain salad with tomatoes.Ingredients8 servings2pints fior di latte gelato1cup NutellaCoarsely chopped toasted blanched hazelnuts, crumbled amaretti cookies (Italian macaroons) and/or wafer cookies (for serving)PreparationPlace a scoop of gelato into each chilled bowl. Spoon a dollop of Nutella over each and top with another scoop or two of gelato. Top as desired.How would you rate Italian Sundaes with Nutella?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (3)Back to TopTriangleWould I ever make it again? I wouldn't make it in the first place. It is not a recipe. It is not even a good suggestion, a glob of Nutella on a scoop of ice cream. Additionally, the accompanying video of a guy looking for the best Buffalo wings in Buffalo opens with an offensive ethnic shout, \"Bill's Mafia.\" You see, the Mafia, as I understand it, is not a good thing. Are you guys at BA all on vacation this month? One other question, what does \"null with review\" mean?Anonymous8/3/2018not a recipe. good job bon apple tea.Anonymous900048/3/2018I'm sorry, but this is not a recipe. I was looking for a recipe for nutella topping but this is just click-bait. That doesn't even look like nutella (which has very little chocolate) but more like fudge sauce. Nutella is more like peanut butter in consistency and would not spread but glop on the ice cream or gelato.
