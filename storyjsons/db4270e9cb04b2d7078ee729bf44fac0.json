I\u2019ve always loved the notion of whole grain mustard, but I find the texture to be slimy and off-putting. I adore the heat and spreadability of a uniformly smooth Dijon, but sometimes it can be a bit...unnervingly smooth. But Maille Rich Country Dijon mustard? It\u2019s juuuuust right: silky and soft with just the right ratio of pungent mustard seeds peppered throughout. You could probably make your own with a ratio of 75% smooth to 25% whole grain, which is probably exactly what the company does to make it. But you don\u2019t have to! Because Maille did it for you, and put it in a jar, and gave it a sick name, and put it on shelves, and now I\u2019m writing about how awesome it is, and you\u2019re reading it.But, yeah: I mostly love Rich Country because...it\u2019s called Rich Country, which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree is a pretty unnecessarily epic name for a condiment. It sounds like the next great Rick Ross album. Or a Keith Urban\u2013themed Southern waterpark. Or a new bourbon endorsed by a retired pro wrestler. But it\u2019s not! It\u2019s mustard. And it\u2019s helped clarify for me that I want my condiments to do more than simply enhance the taste of food I\u2019m preparing\u2014I want them to enhance my life, to spark joy every time I pull them out of the fridge. Indeed, every time I reach for my new favorite mustard, I can\u2019t help but whisper the name aloud as if I were starring in a commercial for it\u2014R-r-r-r-iiiiiiich Coooooountry\u2014and laugh out loud while I\u2019m making lunch. (This could be the quarantine brain talking, but still. It\u2019s the little things, people.)Anyhoo, this mustard is perfect\u2014exactly what I want to perk up a salad dressing, lend some oomph to a turkey sandwich, or serve as a condiment alongside a dinner of sausages and sauerkraut. Sweet, salty, sour, and spicy, it\u2019s already secured a coveted spot in my Desert Island Condiment Hall of Fame, right up there with Heinz ketchup and Hellmann\u2019s mayo. And while I\u2019m sure that the next time I go to the grocery store, I\u2019ll probably find it surrounded by any number of comparable products, I refuse to accept any substitute. It\u2019s Rich Country\u2014R-r-r-r-iiiiiiich Coooooountry\u2014or nothing for me from here on out.Buy it: Maille Rich Country Dijon Mustard Blend, $5 on MercatoAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
