He can\u2019t stop buying them\u2014chunky wood ones; a delicate, bone-china-hued Laguiole set, who knows what\u2019s next. (One coworker asked if he was a serial killer, given his affinity. For the record, he\u2019s not!)I didn\u2019t understand his obsession until I stumbled upon these stunning steak knives at Cheval d\u2019Or in Paris via Instagram (I know, I know, but whatever!). They looked playful and modern, as if designed in collaboration by my dream aesthetic duo: Dr. Seuss and Christian Louboutin.
