I know how to dice an onion, and I have a sharp knife that\u2019ll get the job done, but I find it...pretty tedious? Mind-numbingly boring? A hard-to-justify time suck? Oh, I\u2019m being dramatic? Maybe so, but the closest I get to \"dicing\" is roughly chopping.But as much as it pains me to admit it, there are times when roughly chopping just won\u2019t do. If you\u2019re looking for super-tender bits that melt away into the sauce for shrimp scampi pasta or disintegrate into soffritto for minestrone\u2014it is important that the onion be in tiny pieces that will cook quickly, evenly, and all the way through.So I was thrilled to see that Sohla El-Waylly understood\u2014and accommodated\u2014my laziness. In her new recipe for Fideos With Chicken Thighs and Kale, she doesn\u2019t ask you to dice an onion (hoorah!): Instead, she has you shred it to bits on a box grater. In a mere matter of seconds, the large holes of the grater turn an intact onion half into a pile of scraps. The pieces are a little uneven, sure, but it\u2019s nothing a quick run-through with your knife won\u2019t fix. The box grater strikes again, as if we didn\u2019t already know that the trusty old tool isn\u2019t a one-trick pony.This technique (permission to call it a \"hack\" please???) is game-changing. Not only is it much faster than dicing, but it also goes one step further in breaking down the onion and exposing its watery insides, meaning that it will get even jammier and softer as it cooks.So the next time a recipe calls for dicing an onion (or even a shallot!), put down your knife and try your box grater instead. Your stuffing, collard greens (can you tell I\u2019m in the Thanksgiving mindset?), and dal will not suffer\u2014and you will surely benefit.Okay, this is the part of the story where I say something about how great graters are, I think. But instead, I\u2019m just going to leave you with this recipe:Fideos With Chicken Thighs and KaleWith a crispy, toasted top hiding saucy, tomato-y noodles, this one-skillet broken spaghetti dish is anything but one-note.View RecipeBuy it: Norpro Stainless Steel Grater, $7 on AmazonAll products featured on Basically are independently selected by our editors.
