But there\u2019s a silver lining to this otherwise sad situation. Even after you eat the last olive, an unexpected star remains: olive brine. And I\u2019m asking you\u2014begging you!\u2014not to throw it out.Olive brine is the liquid olives are packaged in, essentially salt water that\u2019s been infused with the deep, alluring flavor of olives. And while it\u2019s basically a by-product, I\u2019ve found it to be an incredibly versatile condiment of sorts, a splash of which can lend a welcome pop of salt and complexity wherever it is needed. (To be clear, I\u2019m referring to the brine that comes from the kinds of olives sold in glass jars, or the ones at the deli that you scoop from large trays into plastic containers along with some of the liquid they\u2019ve been sitting in\u2014not vacuum-sealed olives or the ones that come in cans.) While it sounds humble, olive brine is a secret ingredient that stretches my dollar, reduces waste in my kitchen, and adds depth to my vegetarian meals.I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s particularly well-suited to food inspired by cuisines that make good use of the olive: Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, and southern European. A good entry-level use of olive brine is adding a few tablespoons to your store-bought (or not!) marinara sauce, which takes a humdrum meal of noodles and red sauce to an utterly satisfying place\u2014a hack if there ever was one.\u00a0But the options are pretty much endless. While saving some for extra-dirty martinis is a no-brainer, I also like to add olive brine to salad dressings, blended vegetable soups, pasta salads, grain bowls\u2014you name it, I\u2019ve probably added olive brine to it. Sometimes I even use a splash to season water for cooking rice or pasta, which adds a subtle, implacable savoriness. The beauty of the brine is that while it adds olive flavor, it can be as subtle or strong as you like.My obsession with the stuff started a few years ago when I ran out of olives but desperately wanted spaghetti alla puttanesca, and I haven\u2019t looked back. Once I realized olive brine was a sneaky shortcut to acidity and depth, I started using it creatively and spontaneously, adding it to whatever needed some oomph\u2014and I hope you will too. I, for one, have no regrets.Explore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
