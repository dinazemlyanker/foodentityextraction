So I made it happen in an hour.By Alyse WhitneyFebruary 22, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Marcus Nilsson, Food Styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, Prop Styling by Angharad BaileyFacebookTwitterEmailEven the most hands-off recipes can throw a wrench in your weekend plans. I bookmarked our new short ribs slow-roasted in coconut milk to make on a lazy Sunday at home, and then I realized I had a Broadway show smack in the middle of the day. That didn't leave 5\u20136 hours to stay home and babysit my oven.So after some Googling around to figure out how to convert a recipe from oven-roasting to pressure cooking, I discovered that these pressure cooker short ribs could be tender and ready in about an hour. (You should cut to \u201cabout \u2153 of the standard cooking time,\u201d according to Melissa Clark,  New York Times columnist and author of Instant Pot cookbook Dinner in an Instant.)Since the flanken-style short ribs I had were only about \u00be\" thick when the recipe called for 1\u00bd\u20132\" thickness, I went for 1 hour at high pressure on my Crock Pot multi-cooker. (Looks and works just like an Instant Pot, but costs $30 less\u2014$69.99 at Target.) I stood the ribs up so they were shingled across the bottom of the pot and nine ribs (3 lbs.) fit snugly. There was no searing needed\u2014just 10 minutes of prep to blitz grated lemongrass and ginger and chopped red chile, shallot, and garlic with a can of coconut milk and 1 Tbsp. curry powder in a blender. I poured the coconut milk mix over the ribs, cooked for an hour, and then let the pressure release naturally so the meat didn\u2019t toughen. I was nervous they\u2019d need more time, but they were perfectly tender; when I lifted a piece of short rib out of the pot, it fell apart in my tongs and the bones fell out immediately.You could make soy sauce-marinated short ribs in a pressure cooker too.\nAlex LauIn the oven for so many hours, the liquid reduces and caramelizes into something that resembles a sticky, jammy glaze. The pressure cooker doesn\u2019t do that without one quick extra step. While I shredded the meat, I let the sauce reduce on saut\u00e9 mode in the pressure cooker for about 10 minutes and made some rice. After cooking down a bit, it resembled traditional Indonesian beef rendang that this recipe is based on: beef coated in thick, saucy, curry-spiced coconut milk with subtle sweetness and kick of spice.Short ribs aren\u2019t typically a weeknight meal, but this pressure cooker-adapted recipe makes it possible. And it holds up the next day\u2014I packed shredded short ribs, sauce, and rice together in pint containers for way-above-average meal prep. It could also help take the pressure off while hosting a spontaneous dinner party, or save you if you forgot about an anniversary dinner until 2 hours before. Whoever you make it for, they\u2019ll go coconuts.Ready to make it?
