First came senior food editor Andy Baragahani\u2019s exquisite lamb meatballs with raisin pesto that landed on the cover of BA's April issue. That warming spice blend! The bright, herby raisin pesto! We swooned. Then our friends over at Basically dropped a sheet pan chicken meatball recipe that made meal prep feel like no big thing. Game over.But not quite. We thought it was time to get vegetarians\u2014and chickpea lovers\u2014in on the fun. These meatless meatballs have a spicy soy-honey glaze that creates more nuanced flavor than other veggie balls, and their herby chickpea-mushroom base mimics a traditional meatball's heft without any grains or, you know, meat. \u201cI wanted people to make these and not spend half a day on them,\u201d says Baraghani. \u201cThey look good, are made from mostly pantry items, and still have a lot of flavor going on.\u201d Served alongside a bright and crunchy celery salad, it\u2019s fair to say these vegetarian meatballs are our spring meatball crush.Start creating your base by pulsing shiitake mushrooms in a food processor to make pieces no bigger than \u00bc\". Transfer the mushroom pieces to a lightly oiled, parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and add chickpeas, then bake, tossing halfway through, until the chickpeas are slightly darker and the mushrooms have browned and slightly shrunken. It should take about 35\u201340 minutes, and you want to let them cool for as long as you can after to get the creamiest possible texture later. Keep the oven on, because you'll need it again soon.While the chickpea-mushroom mixture cools, you\u2019re going to make a glaze on the stovetop. Mix together a thinly sliced red chile, soy sauce, honey, and a tablespoon of unseasoned rice vinegar, then bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring frequently for about ten minutes until it\u2019s slightly thickened and foamy.Next, it\u2019s time to bring the rest of the meatballs together. While the glaze cools, use a food processor to pulse eggs, ginger, garlic, panko, scallion greens, cilantro, and oil until the mixture is fully incorporated. The aromatics add flavor, eggs acts as a binder, and breadcrumbs help bind while adding heft. Add the chickpeas and mushrooms and pulse again, then transfer the whole mixture to a large bowl and chill in the fridge for 20-25 minutes so they can firm up enough to be shaped.Now, the fun part. Roll the chickpea mixture into little golf balls, arrange them on a parchment-covered baking sheet, and brush with about a quarter of your spicy soy glaze.  Bake them until they're firm and slightly darkened, 18\u201320 minutes, and use this time to assemble a super fresh celery salad to contrast the creamy meatballs and sweet spicy glaze. Just toss together cilantro, celery leaves and stems, and the rest of your scallions with some vinegar. Drizzle some soy honey sauce over the finished meatballs, then serve the rest alongside.\"You can make these ahead of time and then bake them off when you need them, but once they\u2019re cooked you should eat them right away,\" says Baraghani. We recommend keeping them, unbaked, in the fridge for no more than two days. To store them for longer, freeze the unbaked meatballs on a sheet tray to prevent sticking, then transfer them to a plastic bag and keep for up to a month. Frozen meatballs will need to bake a little longer, so keep an eye on them and watch until they are browned and cooked through.Once ready, these meatballs are an amazing cooking shortcut. Grab a few to go for a quick, high-protein snack, or serve them over whole grains or study greens for an easily assembled lunch bowl\u2014that's also cheaper than any fast casual spot around.Get ready to roll:Vegetarian Meatballs with Soy-Honey GlazeThis vegetarian dinner features a spicy soy-honey glaze that caramelizes on the chickpea-mushroom balls as they cook.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titMeatballMeatless MondaysVegetarianHealthyishRead MorecookingA Saucy, Crispy Tofu Recipe for People Who THINK They Hate the StuffBy Chris MoroccoRecipes you want to make.
