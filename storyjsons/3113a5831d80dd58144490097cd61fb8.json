A great brownie is a near perfect thing\u2014how were we to improve on it without adding unnecessary accoutrements?But one thing that was always certain, even in the early stages when I was flailing wildly: This would be an all-cocoa brownie, built on cocoa powder rather than melted chocolate. And the reason wasn\u2019t just because we figured more people keep a container of cocoa powder than a stack of chocolate bars on hand.As compared to those made with just chocolate or a combination of the two, cocoa brownies are reliably superior in terms of texture and flavor.First up, texture: Cocoa brownies stay softer than chocolate brownies\u2014they won\u2019t feel dry or crumbly, even if you prefer, like me, to eat them straight from the fridge\u2014because they get their fat from butter as opposed to cocoa butter. Why? Cocoa powder contains very little cocoa butter (it\u2019s low in fat compared to chocolate bars), which means that additional butter must be added to cocoa brownies to compensate. And because butter is much softer than cocoa butter at room temperature (just think of the texture of a chocolate bar versus the texture of a stick of butter), this means that cocoa brownies stay tender and velvety. Brownies based in melted chocolate, on the other hand, become sturdier and less yielding as they cool and age.Next comes taste. Cocoa powder is the straightest path to intense chocolate flavor because it\u2019s 100 percent cocoa\u2014there\u2019s nothing else getting in the way. Chocolate bars, on the other hand, contain sugar, additional fat (as we\u2019ve mentioned), vanilla, and sometimes emulsifiers and stabilizers. And even two different chocolate bars at the same percentage (say, 72%) will vary in sweetness, mouthfeel, and taste. Unsweetened cocoa powder simply provides more control. WE. LOVE. CONTROL.And where melted chocolate introduces more moisture to the brownie and, consequently, requires additional flour to balance it out, cocoa powder can stand in for a portion of the flour. With less flour, the brownies taste barely bound, with no risk of cakiness or toughness.That\u2019s not to say that you should use the dusty canister of cocoa that was in your apartment when you moved in\u2014cocoa powders also vary in quality (we love Guittard Cocoa Rouge Dutch Processed Cocoa Powder). But cocoa powder is generally more reliable because there are fewer variables at play.So stick with the cocoa powder and save your chocolate bars for chopping up and adding to cookie dough. Both your brownies and your cookies will thank you.Get the recipe:Camouflage Chocolate Fudge BrowniesThe secret to the fudgiest, most chocolaty brownies is cocoa powder\u2014not melted chocolate. We borrowed chocolate expert Alice Medrich\u2019s technique, then added a cream cheese topping for tangy balance. Don\u2019t overthink your camo design; the brownies will look even better when sliced.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasically BakingBakeRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
