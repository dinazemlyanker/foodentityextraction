This dish was traditionally prepared with foraged native Brodiaea potatoes, though Medina and Trevino use more widely available Russian banana fingerlings to give the Brodiaeas time to regenerate. Medina and Trevino say: \u201cYou can see the landscape of this area reflected in the dish: It really brings home the interconnectedness of our land, food, and culture.\u201d For readers who don\u2019t have access to the same ingredients, we have called for more widely available substitutes in this adapted version of their recipe.Ingredients6 - 8 Servings2lb. fingerling or other small waxy\tpotatoes, scrubbed4fresh bay leavesKosher salt3Tbsp. duck fat, room temperature6scallions, sliced on a diagonal into \t\u00bd\" piecesPreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 425\u00b0.
