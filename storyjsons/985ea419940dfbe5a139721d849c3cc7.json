You can also use a food processor; the finished pur\u00e9e will just have more texture. This recipe makes more pur\u00e9e than you need, but you can use the hummus-like condiment as a dip for warm pita or raw vegetables, or as a sandwich schmear.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Cut broccoli lengthwise into \u00bc\"-thick planks (try to keep crown and stem attached). Toss broccoli planks with oil in a large bowl to coat; season with salt and pepper. Grill, turning occasionally, until charred all over (they\u2019ll look burnt, and that\u2019s a good thing) but stems are still crisp-tender, about 5 minutes; reserve bowl. (Or you can broil broccoli in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet, undisturbed, until well-charred on 1 side, 14\u201316 minutes.) Transfer broccoli back to reserved bowl and cover tightly and let sit 30 minutes to steam.Step 2Meanwhile, whisk labneh, half of garlic, and 2 Tbsp. water in a small bowl until smooth and the consistency of ranch dressing (add more water if needed). Season dressing with salt and pepper.Step 3Cut broccoli into bite-size pieces (about 3\"), separating florets from stems as you go. Coarsely chop stems and measure out 1 cup; set aside. Return remaining broccoli to bowl; add figs and 1 Tbsp. lemon juice. Toss to combine; season with salt and pepper. Set aside.Step 4Blend tahini, reserved broccoli stems, remaining garlic, remaining 2 Tbsp. lemon juice, and \u00bd cup water in a high-speed blender until very smooth and the consistency of a loose hummus. Season pur\u00e9e with salt and pepper.Step 5Spread \u00bd cup pur\u00e9e on a platter. Top with reserved broccoli salad and spoon dressing over (you won\u2019t need all of it). Scatter herbs, sumac, and lemon zest over.Do ahead: Dressing can be made 3 days ahead.
