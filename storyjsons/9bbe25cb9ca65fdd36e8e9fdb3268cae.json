Chef Bobby of Little Red Fox uses Tillamook Sharp Cheddar for a queso that complements every dippable snack in sight.PrintIngredients\u00bd lb. tomatillos, husks removed and rinsed (or 4 oz. jarred)1 Fresno chili (optional)\u00bd cup white wine2 cups heavy cream1 \u00bd Tbsp. ground cumin\u00bd Tbsp. garlic powder1 \u00bc lbs Tillamook Sharp Cheddar, grated2 Tbsp. cornstarchRecipe PreparationHeat a medium cast iron skillet over moderate heat. Add tomatillos and chili (if using) and cook, turning until blackened in spots. Transfer to a cutting board, cool then roughly chop the tomatillos. Discard the seeds from the chili and finely chop. (You will probably only want to use half the chili.)Bring white wine to a boil in a medium saucepan over moderate heat. Whisk in \u00bd cup of the heavy cream, 1 tablespoon of the cumin, and the garlic powder. When the cream starts to simmer, whisk in 1 cup of grated Tillamook Sharp Chedder and the cornstarch until smooth and emulsified, whisking constantly, add in another \u00bd cup of heavy cream. Allow the sauce to thicken, then alternate with remaining additions of cheese and cream.After all the cream has been added, turn off heat. Add the remaining cumin, the chopped tomatillos, and chili to taste, mixing to marble the red and green colors throughout.Dig in! The sauce is best served warm: ladle it over pasta like macaroni or on top of chips, as a dip with vegetables, or as a condiment on your favorite sandwich.Tillamook is a farmer-owned cooperative based in Oregon that connects farmers and food lovers through better-made dairy products.
