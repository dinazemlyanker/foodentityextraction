The scientist is cackling maniacally, shrieking, \u201cI\u2019VE DONE IT! I\u2019VE DONE IT THIS TIME!\u201d And an assistant in a Hawaiian-print shirt rolls his eyes and is like, \u201cWhat?\u201d And the scientist is like, \u201cCAULIFLOWER CRACKERSSSSSSSSSS.\u201dAnd here we are. Trader Joe\u2019s latest offerings include cauliflower crackers, yep, and multiple varieties of cheese: puffy, saucy, puddly, and firm. Those and more new products are reviewed below, from my own personal subbasement.(Read last month\u2019s reviews)Alex BeggsBrown Things85 Percent Ugandan Dark ChocolateThis is the chocolate bar I picture when celebrities say they have \u201cone square of dark chocolate\u201d as dessert, maybe the most annoying dessert of all time. HAVE YOU HEARD OF CAKE?! It never ceases to disappoint. Celebrities: constantly disappointing. Oh, the chocolate, it\u2019s bitter but still silky and rich. It breaks into shards sharp enough to clean the grime under your fingernails, though that might make them even dirtier.Organic Dark Chocolate Covered Whole Cocoa BeansThese are also intensely bitter but crunchy\u2014so that\u2019s fun. If you\u2019re the person who likes just one square of chocolate because you read too many tabloids in the checkout aisle, you\u2019ll love these. And who am I to question the whims of man?Instant Cold BrewSummon the memory of lukewarm rental-car lobby coffee, left in a paper cup overnight, and know that this is worse than that.Alex BeggsExciting CrackersRed Chili Scalloped Crackers\u201cWe will be buying these for the rest of our lives,\u201d said my domestic partner, who this company has finally granted permission to be on my health insurance. And I say this without exaggeration: These are Trader Joe\u2019s BEST crackers. The chile brings a hint of pizza Goldfish, they\u2019re flaky yet sturdy, and they would never, ever refuse to concede an election.Bite-Size Sharp Cheddar Cheesy CrackersExcuse me, Joe? These need to come in a bigger box. If you like the cheese-greasiness of Cheez-Its, you\u2019ll love these. They\u2019re not airy/puffy/crispy, but dense and cheddar-y, a good martini snack\u2014or in the afternoon with sliced apple. They taste fatty, buttery. I also like their cute scalloped edges, which remind me of the Chlo\u00e9 flats my absurdly wealthy NYU classmates wore in the mid-2007s. I made the mistake of splurging on a pair of purple Uggs I thought would get me laid. They didn\u2019t.Alex BeggsEven More CrackersCauliflower CrispsDr. Joe had a breakthrough. The dehydrated cauliflower base (okay) is mixed with brown rice flour, which is super crispy and toasty tasting\u2014smart combo. Also, it\u2019s GLUTEN-FREE yada yada. The people want cauliflower, they demand it, let\u2019s give it to them. I dipped these into the new cauliflower-jalape\u00f1o cheese dip (see below) for double-cauli-trouble (the trouble is the test of this cruciferous-ness on my intestines). Try \u2019em!Trail Mix CrackersEach nut is placed by hand? Good god, who has the time? A shattering cheesy cracker base is decorated with seeds and individually placed cashew halves and raisins. So they\u2019re sweet, cheesy, nutty, crunchy, all at once. I ate them plain because I don\u2019t see how you could possibly pile more on. Put them on a cheese plate and look forward to vacuuming the seeds off the floor when everyone leaves.Alex BeggsGluten-Free ThingsGrainless Cassava and Coconut Tortilla ChipsI texted my aunt with the chip basket above the fridge filled with years-old PopCorners and batteries she doesn\u2019t want to throw away, because these are her JAM. They\u2019re so airy, thanks to being fried in avocado oil and not reeking with rancid coconut oil. Something interesting: They\u2019re flavored with everything bagel seasoning (poppy seed, dehydrated garlic and onion), but Joe didn\u2019t call them \u201cEverything but the Gluten Tortilla Chips.\u201d Maybe that\u2019s only interesting to me. They\u2019re promoting the trendiness of CASSAVA and COCONUT, and I will whisper into your ear as you fall asleep on the couch watching women with perfectly wavy hair arrange empty vases on Dream Home Makeover, \u201cthey\u2019re still chips.\u201d Enjoy.Ginger Turmeric GranolaBIG clusters. Spicy and warming. \ud83d\udea8 Nutmeg alert. \ud83d\udea8Alex BeggsThere\u2019s Always DipsEverything but the Bagel Greek Yogurt DipYa coulda fooled me, yogurt, I thought this was sour cream, it\u2019s so thick and tangy. Perfectly paired with those everything-spiced cassava tortilla chips. Could you make it yourself by sprinkling \u201ceverything\u201d seasoning into Greek yogurt? Maybe! But as the refrain this month goes: Who. Has. The. Time.Creamy Cauliflower Jalape\u00f1o DipINTO IT. Parmesan and ricotta are the base of this dip, a part of Joe\u2019s Cauliflower Propaganda line. It\u2019s not thaaat spicy, ya wimps. It\u2019s no Buff Chicken Dip, I admit, but it\u2019s truly, surprisingly good. Pair with Cauliflower Crisps, I don\u2019t really care what you do with your time.Alex BeggsCheese and SausageChardonnay ToscanoThis cheese is soaked in Chardonnay, but who isn\u2019t these days? Ha ha ha, put that on a wooden sign and sell it at HomeGoods. The Toscano is creamy, salty, and more snackable than Parmesan. Please follow the cheese commandments and eat it at room temperature. I\u2019d buy this cheese again, and not because it has a performative drinking problem. It\u2019s good!Buffalo Style Chicken SausageAffordable, tasty, serve with ranch.Alex BeggsSoupUnexpected Broccoli Cheddar SoupI was comforted to see that this soup is not green, but white, because it is mostly cheese. It\u2019s creamy and sharp with a hint of broccoli. I saluted to the dutiful orange carrot cubes doing their part. I\u2019ll take this over gloopy canned soup any day, even if it might just be queso?Alex Beggs2 Nondairy Things and 1 Dairy Thing (My Bad)Maple Oat BeverageGet a WHIFF of that, baby. That is the smell of maple, the flavor, not maple, the syrup. Maple the flavor has a whiff of sham to it, like year-round Christmas stores. Now, I love a year-round Christmas store\u2014shout out to Bronner\u2019s\u2014therefore I love this oat beverage. It smells a lot stronger than it ultimately tastes, and it\u2019s lovely steamed up for a latte or a London fog (chic).Dark Chocolate Almond Butter Cups *Leave these almond butter not-Justin\u2019s \ud83d\ude09 cups in a sunny spot in your car/on the kitchen counter for optimal results: gooey, creamy almond butter oozes out.Sorry this has milk in itAlmond Beverage Chocolate BarThis is creamy imitation-milk chocolate for those who don\u2019t do milk, and it is an uncanny impression. I did notice it was slightly chewy and doesn\u2019t quite melt in your mouth. But the taste is creamy and would be great chopped up in chocolate chip cookies.Alex BeggsFrozen ThingsCreamed GreensMushy green puddle, don\u2019t hate it!Alex BeggsBrazilian Style Cheese BreadYou can\u2019t argue with p\u00e3o de queijo ready for the smashing in 6\u20138 minutes. Puffy, cheesy, doughy, spongy, some cheesier than others, some mysteriously dense. Of all the new cheese products mentioned today, MANY, this is my favorite.Harvest Spaghetti Squash SpiralsThis belongs in TJ\u2019s airline food collection, where everything is pretty disgusting but at least there\u2019s melted cheese, and what else are you gonna eat? Skip this, and air travel, while you still can.Cheese-Filled Fiochetti with Pink SauceI added salt and some red pepper flakes to enhance the \u201cpink sauce,\u201d in which little coin purses of bowling alley sock\u2013scented cheese swim about. I ate the whole thing and even drank the \u201cpink sauce\u201d (tomato queso, everything is queso) straight from the bowl as I watched Dream Home Makeover. I can\u2019t stop thinking about those opulent homes filled with meaningless objets, arranged and rearranged on a never-ending loop. The decor equivalent of frozen pasta sauce. A beautiful, mass-produced lie. And I\u2019ll drink every last drop.Alex BeggsTostonesServing suggestion: 1 coaster-size tostone per person?! This bag contains around 7\u20138 tostones, and two people will eat them all, smothered in refried beans, cheese, and pickled jalape\u00f1os, in my case (garlicky green sauce would be good too). You can bake them (bad idea, too dry) or fry them in oil (good idea, they\u2019re fried).Alex BeggsA ChickenHeirloom Whole Chicken, \u201cGiblets May Be Missing\u201dThis is an affordable whole chicken, and by cooking a WHOLE chicken of an heirloom breed, you are supporting a better, less wasteful, more humane food system, one that hopefully doesn\u2019t force its workers into unsafe conditions where they contract COVID-19. Plus, you get to fill your house with chicken perfume and feel like a domestic goddess and all that shit. Make sure to roast the chicken on top of some potatoes or a pile of mushrooms for a chicken fat\u2013soaked built-in side dish.
