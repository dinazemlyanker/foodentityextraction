I\u2019d put on the requisite few pounds you do in the first giddy year or so of dating, and while the power of love is such that you don\u2019t really mind, the power of oppressive body norms is such that you also kind of do. Moreover, I was woefully aware that woman cannot live on Indian takeout alone.I remembered that a friend of mine had once sung the praises of keto for a couple reasons: (1) it made him feel a hell of a lot better, and (2) he lost unwanted weight in the process. And so, lying in bed, polishing off a pint of ice cream I figured I\u2019d better get rid of before I made any moves toward better health, I began my research.Introduced in the 1920s as a treatment for epilepsy and currently used as a means of establishing dietary superiority over everyone you know, the ketogenic diet is a way to force your body to burn fat instead of carbohydrates, ordinarily its go-to source, as fuel. In theory, the benefits include more plentiful and stable energy throughout the day, a more satisfying fullness after each meal, and a merciful escape from the blood-sugar rollercoaster that many people\u2014myself included\u2014typically ride on a sugar-rich diet.To get your body into ketosis, you cut your carbs down to a maximum of 20-25 grams per day, filling out the rest of your daily calories with a little bit of protein and a lot of fat. Carb-wise, that means about a slice of bread at most\u2014and frankly, if you\u2019re looking to make it as painless as possible, you\u2019ll omit the bread and save your carbs for those that come with vegetables, nuts, and seeds. The rest of your meals will be composed of fat-rich foods: eggs, cheese, butter, bacon, steak, you name it. If you\u2019re vegetarian, as I am, you\u2019re looking at mostly eggs, oils, and cheese. If you\u2019re vegan, I\u2019m so sorry.The diet is extreme, strict, and socially alienating. It would be a significant lifestyle change, and it would mean challenging a long-held fear of mine: eating fat. As a woman\u2014specifically, an American woman raised in a world where the only acceptable body to inhabit is one that is slim and well-dressed\u2014I\u2019ve been programmed from girlhood to fear rich, fat-laden foods almost as much as I\u2019ve been conditioned to love exercises that tone my muscles without making them bulky.But, for better or worse, when it comes to personal challenges, I behave the way Marty McFly does when anyone calls him chicken: I take the bait.NovemberConveniently, the day I begin my keto journey is a week before Thanksgiving, which I am to spend with my family in Massachusetts.My dad is vegan and my sister doesn\u2019t eat meat. My mother, an omnivore, has always been gracious and flexible, cooking alternatives for my father or eating whatever bean-based concoction my dad has made. Family dining has never been anything but harmonious.And then I ruin everything.I call my mom to tell her about my dietary restrictions. \u201cLet me get this straight,\u201d she says. \u201cNo sugar. No carbs. No potatoes?\u201d\u201cTragically, no.\u201d\u201cHow about sweet potatoes?\u201d\u201cThose are also potatoes.\u201d\u201cBut meat is okay?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m vegetarian, Mom.\u201dThere\u2019s a weighty pause. \u201cI\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d she says, all business, and hangs up.And she does. We have walnut and beet dumplings, pur\u00e9ed cauliflower masquerading as mashed potatoes, something that is probably tofu?, an improbable amount of mushrooms. For dessert, I make a lemon-almond cake with almond and coconut flours that, despite its approximately twelve whipped egg whites, refuses to rise, devastated by the absence of glutinous flour. Flat as it is, it tastes fairly good. It\u2019s the most bizarre Thanksgiving we\u2019ve ever had.DecemberFor almost a month, I\u2019ve managed to skirt invitations to dinners (famed Roberta\u2019s pizza, pasta temple Lilia, arepa joint Caracas) and resist ordering takeout from my go-to spots (Agra Taj Mahal, M. Noodle Shop, Oasis Falafel). I\u2019ve cobbled together a wide variety of meals: broccoli and tofu with peanut sauce, peppers and tofu with peanut sauce, zucchini and tofu with peanut sauce. I\u2019ve even figured out how to make a mushy yet delicious cauliflower-crusted pizza. And when I\u2019m too tired to cook, there\u2019s always the option of just setting a block of cheese on a plate and going to town. Finally, I have permission to eat what everyone truly wants: literally as much cheese as my stomach will hold down. I feel liberated.There\u2019s one big problem though: Running sucks.I have been a regular runner since I was seventeen\u2014not competitively, but my routine is what\u2019s held my sanity in place in the toughest of times. On keto, sans carbs, my muscles are groggy and leaden, pleading with me to stop every step of the way.\u201cI thought my body was supposed to become an ultra-efficient fat-burning machine,\u201d I say through a mouthful of flaccid zucchini noodles to the few friends I\u2019ve told about my endeavor. \u201cWhat gives?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I could even get out of bed without carbs,\u201d says one friend.\u201cYeah, I think I\u2019d just die,\u201d says another.I swallow my mouthful of carbless noodles and thank my friends for their helpful advice.Over Christmas, I rediscover full-fat cottage cheese. \u201cThis is so exciting!\u201d I exclaim to my parents. \u201cI can eat as much of it as I want!\u201dThey exchange a look.\u201cYou\u2019re an adult,\u201d my mom says simply.\u201cI can\u2019t stop you,\u201d says my dad.I take this as their blessing.Cottage cheese becomes my always breakfast, and my occasional dinner. I take a subtle litmus test of my colleagues\u2019 feelings about it becoming my lunch too. \u201cHey, would it be weird if I ate straight from a tub of cottage cheese at lunch?\u201d I ask. The vote is a unanimous Yes and please don\u2019t.JanuaryI head to Vermont for a weeklong writing residency. I haven\u2019t yet decided whether I\u2019ll cheat on keto while I\u2019m up there, but what I do know is that I do not want to discuss this regime with any of the people I\u2019m about to meet for the first time and to whom I would like to come across as a very Chill and Normal Human Being, rather than an unnecessarily high-maintenance dining companion.It goes well\u2014until we discover that the cafeteria serves local homemade ice cream. I look on sadly as my new friends load their bowls. \u201cWant some?\u201d someone asks, proffering their bowl. \u201cIt\u2019s too cold for ice cream,\u201d I reply, fooling no one.The truth, actually, is that for the past month or so that I\u2019ve been keto, my body has felt like it\u2019s burning up. Which must, I think, be good\u2014except that as a person with a natural complexion already on the pinkish side, I am now consistently vaguely red-faced and a little sweatier than usual. This is not even to mention the nights, during which I seem to be performing Pilates in my sleep, waking up consistently on soaked sheets.My boyfriend seems to have resigned himself to having a small blast furnace for a girlfriend, probably because he is verbally contractually obligated to love me.In the meantime, I\u2019m beginning to feel like my sacrifice is for naught. My food pyramid is now more of a blob. I still feel like I\u2019m dragging a toddler by each ankle when I go for a run. I wonder how long you can go without fruit before you get scurvy.At the end of January, my boyfriend and I travel to Asheville for his birthday. We\u2019ve got one night in this town brimming with good food, and we want to spend it well.\u201cI think I want to cheat tonight,\u201d I say, and when evening rolls around, we make a beeline to a well-reviewed pizza parlor.I am trembling with excitement as we order and wait for our pies to arrive. And then they do.I don\u2019t know how to adequately describe what it\u2019s like to sink your teeth into a soft, yeasty hunk of pizza crust after three months without eating any kind of bread. What I can say is that it is in this very moment\u2014with the crust just beginning to dissolve into sweet, sweet glucose on my tongue\u2014that I know in my heart of hearts that I am done with keto.I begin a \u201cgentle\u201d reintroduction to the world of carbs. I eat a huge bowl of granola and yogurt. I buy a sandwich at lunch. For dinner, I have the first taste of pasta I\u2019ve had in three months, in a heaping bowlful.My stomach churns and burns after meals my first week post-keto. I start to worry that I\u2019ve permanently altered my gut\u2019s digestive abilities The thought makes me panic. I see a lifetime flash before my eyes, a future of having to covertly tug at someone\u2019s sleeve at restaurants and gatherings and dinner parties and whisper, \u201cExcuse me, are there carbs in this?\u201d I picture my last meal: my boyfriend spooning soggy cauliflower pizza into my mouth as I lie on my deathbed, too weak to protest. (A word of hard-earned wisdom: if you can eat it with a spoon, it is decidedly not pizza.)And then, after a week, everything goes back to normal, and it\u2019s almost like I did not spend the last few months systematically polishing off dozens of tubs of cottage cheese.But going keto did give me one thing: It made me eat almost exclusively the very foods I used to fear and in doing so it healed my relationship with fat. That is to say, it healed my relationship with delicious, nutrient-rich foods that are integral to a healthy and well-rounded diet. Even if you\u2019re not burning it as your primary source of fuel, as you do in ketogenesis, your body needs dietary fat: it provides you with essential fatty acids that allow you to store energy, insulate yourself, and protect your vital organs. Your body can\u2019t do it alone.Now that I have resumed non-restrictive eating habits, I find I\u2019m so much more relaxed around food in general: less wary of what effect certain ingredients might have on my body; less anxious about making food choices; and less withholding toward my body, and myself. I will not be going keto again, but I\u2019m actually glad I did.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishLifestyleTrendsRead MoreLifestyleWhat Is This Keto Diet You Keep Hearing About, and Is It Healthy?By Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
