But the city rewards visitors who wander away from the 10-person pileup at touristy spots and beyond the cobblestone confines of Old Montreal. Dig deeper and you\u2019ll find charred bubbled pizzas paired with refreshing natural wines, mind-blowing tasting menus, fantastic French baked goods, a rainbow of meze, and more. So yeah, come for the poutine, but stay for all of the above\u2014and most important, the delicious fruits of Montrealers\u2019 pride in Quebecois ingredients, products, and culinary heritage.
