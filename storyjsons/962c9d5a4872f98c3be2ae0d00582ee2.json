I believe my exact words were: \u201cWTF is this?\u201d Followed by: \u201cIt looks like one of those things that\u2019s gonna take up way more fridge space than it\u2019s worth.\u201d But, reader, I was wrong.How wrong? Well, let me put it this way: Thanks to the OXO GreenSaver Herb Keeper (which is a bit of a redundant name, but I\u2019m no longer here to judge), I now have fresh dill going on THREE WEEKS in my fridge that isn't even limp.See, fresh herbs\u2014like humans!\u2014need good airflow, humidity control, and plenty of hydration to thrive. And the plastic produce bags or interlocking polyethylene clamshells most herbs come in provide none of these things. But you know what does? The OXO GreenSaver Herb Keeper, baby. Its interior basket gently cradles your precious herbs, keeping them from getting all clumpy and slack. The sealed top maintains just-right humidity inside, and you can even add an inch of water to the bottom of the container to keep your herbies hydrated, like a bouquet of flowers.And guess what? The thing costs $12, which is about 1/18th of the lifetime sum I\u2019ve wasted on fresh herbs that have gone full black slime status in my fridge. So yeah, fine, I was wrong, Rob was right, and the OXO GreenSaver Herb Keeper now enjoys a permanent place of residence in our fridge, happily ever after.Buy it: OXO GreenSaver Herb Keeper, $12 on AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
