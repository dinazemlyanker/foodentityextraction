Was pleasantly surprised with the short and humble ingredient list. Really liked the way they jazzed up the base. OmarNew York, NY11/9/2021I've made this multiple times and it always tastes SO good. It's very easy and straight forward and such a great meal to have in your back pocket. Not sure why but it feels more appropriate to make this during spring and summer than during fall and winter, but that's just me. \n\nEither way, try it. You won't regret it. MJToronto4/21/2021I've made this 3x -- it's amazingly delicious.AnonymousAnn Arbor, MI4/21/2021I've made this a few times, but today really nailed it. I generally use TJ's soyrizo, and am going to start making my own. I usually add some roasted sweet potatoes, and had a Japanese yam that I cut up and seasoned and added to the mix. I cut the serving size to three, and also topped with pickled red onions, queso fresco, and cucumber to up the veggies in this. dalex27Pittsburgh, PA8/11/2020I was going through some old copies of Bon Appetit when I ran across this recipe. It sounded good and we hadn't decided what to have for dinner, so I zipped to the market and bought what we needed. Boy, what a delightful surprise when we took our first bite. I expected good, but this was great! Definitely adding it to our rota.Mark JacobsonBethesda, MD7/25/2020A perfect meal for a lazy, hot summer evening, or for an easy weekday lunch. Comes together in maybe 20 minutes. Just remember to spring for nice chorizo, not the mass-marketed stuff. We made tostados and cooked the chickpeas from dried in an Instant Pot and added pickled red onions and shredded cabbage to the mix. Still came together in a snap.monobrownVancouver,BC7/20/2020Tasty!  Was looking for something different to do with the homemade tortillas we get at local farmers market (thank you Katelic I followed your process with the tortillas).  I subbed black beans for the chickpeas because I had lots of them and no chickpeas.  Loved the yogurt sauce.  Good showpiece for the chorizo.  Anonymous190637/20/2020Now that we are home a lot for quarantine we have been cooking way more, we made these for a quick lunch, and they were a big hit! We really enjoyed the fresh yogurt sauce against the chorizo! I had leftover corn tortillas that I rubbed down with a little oil and baked at 400 F, and I used ground chorizo instead of links, since I had some in my freezer, and still turned out supberb!KatelicArizona4/13/2020I am so obsessed with this!!!!!k.scottNew York3/27/2020Fantastic!!! Followed the recipe exactly. Everyone raved over the flavors! I used beef chorizo, though I plan to experiment with other proteins (ground beef, chicken, shrimp, scallops), I will first exhaust all the available chorizo options. This will become a new summer staple (absolutely perfect with ice-cold beer!!)AnonymousKeaau, HI3/14/2020We\u2019ve made this twice now. We used the soy chorizo from Trader Joe\u2019s and Uptons Seitan chorizo. Both were AMAZING but The soy chorizo from TJs was a better substitution in my opinion. All in all this is quick and delicious!! AnonymousBoston, MA1/23/2020It was soooooo easy to make! I had most of the ingredients at home to begin with but since I did overdo it during the holidays, I\u2019m tryin to cut back with indulging this January. I ended up swapping out the sour cream for plain Greek yogurt! And the chorizo was subbed by an oregano turkey sausage I found at my local  market.AdriellePSanto Domingo1/11/2020This was fine I guess. The sauce was really strong, and I couldn't get the same crumbly texture in the chorizo.AnonymousColumbia, SC1/11/2020Really good! I used regular corn tortillas instead of tostadas. Very simple and effective recipe.trebhan1645Michigan4/8/2019Super good! I heavily modified the chickpeas and chorizo to my tastes and to add volume. I added diced tomatoes, onion, all the chickpeas instead of just a 1/2 cup, garlic, paprika, and cayenne. This definitely made it more of a paste than the crumble seen in the pictures, but I wanted it that way. I paired this with the easy flatbread from the feel good food plan.
