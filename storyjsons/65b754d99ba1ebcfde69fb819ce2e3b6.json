Now I\u2019m Defeating Monsters With a Toddler in My Empty RestaurantHow Tyler Kord juggles full-time parenting with running an emergency kitchen at Brooklyn\u2019s No. 7.By Tyler KordMay 13, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Katherine PangaroFacebookTwitterEmailI\u2019m super good at cooking. Making big pots of beans and rice and prepping 200 fried chicken sandwiches in 15 minutes is not difficult for me, or my exceptional wife, Katherine, or my always killer kitchen staff. It\u2019s essentially what we\u2019ve been doing at my restaurant, No. 7, for almost 12 years, and at other places in the industry since long before that. It\u2019s just that right now my restaurant is closed and all the cooking we\u2019re doing is for hospitals, fire departments, and first responders in Brooklyn. And we\u2019re doing it while also having a three-year-old lunatic named Barbara at my side at all times.My daughter, Barbara, does not know that there is a global pandemic happening. She is aware that there are \u201cyucky germs\u201d around and that\u2019s why we wash our hands so much and wear masks and gloves, and it is absolutely affecting her. The other night as I was trying to convince her to go to sleep, she had a small-scale freak-out and demanded hand sanitizer and it\u2019s troubling. She doesn\u2019t get why all of the playgrounds are closed or why she isn\u2019t allowed to come into the grocery store with me and push the cart. I realize there are tons of people out there who don\u2019t share my privilege\u2014of having food and stable housing and cable television loaded with as much Blue\u2019s Clues & You as she can possibly watch (Josh rules!!)\u2014but I\u2019m having a harder and harder time explaining why our lives are so constricted without scaring her. Luckily, I am her best friend in the world, so she is fine with hanging near me all day and not going to daycare.Unfortunately, I have a lot of work to do.PHOTO BY KATHERINE PANGAROWhat this all looks like in practice is a dad constantly trying to convince his daughter that what would really be best right now, as he glazes 60 pounds of chicken-and-broccoli meatloaf with ketchup and sweet chili sauce, is if she would just have a little more screen time over in that booth. Maybe some Frozen 2? Maybe some YouTube, which Katherine has meticulously combed through to remove all the videos of creepy adults unwrapping toys, though they still find a way of occasionally popping up? But she\u2019s unfortunately capable of staring at a screen for only so long, probably because she was born to be the greatest chef/surgeon/abstract painter of all time.So, while the cooks stand six feet apart finishing those meatloaves, and Katherine boxes a huge amount of food and then tries to figure out loans and insurance and how to keep our restaurant open (she spent a couple of years volunteer cooking in post-Katrina New Orleans, so she\u2019s not as stressed as me), and my amazing friends Matthew Maddy and Josh Borock drive the deliveries to the hospitals, Barbara and I run. A lot.Thankfully, No. 7 is a very long restaurant\u2014an 1800-square-foot indoor playground, but with cooks to sneak up on and plenty of ice cream in the freezer. We\u2019ve used up all the good hiding spots for hide-and-seek, but recently we\u2019ve taken to drawing pictures of monsters and taping them up in crafty places, like under the soda gun or on the top shelf of the walk-in. Then we go around, find the monsters, and \u201cdefeat\u201d them by vigorously pointing our magic wands (markers!) at them and shouting \u201cPowers!\u201d because YouTube must have taught her that is how magic wands work. Sometimes one of them will freeze me and I will fall to the floor, unable to move, until Barbara finds the nearest monster and neutralizes it.But even with an oblivious three-year-old sprinting around, the restaurant feels somber. Every time we unlock the door and wrangle Barbara\u2019s stroller into the entrance, she asks where everybody is. She says hi to the cooks, or gets shy and hides behind me, even though she\u2019s known these guys her short but entire life. I suspect it\u2019s the masks. The guys are here because they want to be, but they\u2019re worried about the future, and so am I. We\u2019ve all made the choice to accept an increased risk of infection, the significance of which I don\u2019t mean to casually understate. But my hands feel figuratively tied to feeding the front line. Clueless Barbara is just along for the ride.I know if we didn\u2019t have her with us all day, I would feel more comfortable about all of this. I know we would all be less exhausted. I know we could take more orders from the group paying us to cook for the hospital workers (go to brooklynforlife.org to learn how you can help, and when I say help I mean give them lots of money!!). And with more orders, I could be paying my undocumented kitchen staff more money, which is the reason I\u2019m doing this in the first place, because the government has yet to address the lack of a safety net for restaurant workers. My guys work hard and pay taxes but aren\u2019t able to collect unemployment or stimulus checks or get access to health care\u2014even when they\u2019re in a situation like one of my favorite uninsured cooks who is sick at home with what seems to be COVID-19, which is deeply troubling.But I can\u2019t help value this time with Barbara anyway.When we\u2019re not running around, she \u201chelps\u201d me cook, essentially by making a huge mess. She likes to stir things, but it\u2019s a little scary when it\u2019s 10 pounds of boiling macaroni and cheese. And she is entirely in charge of putting unicorn stickers on the finished take-out boxes (I don\u2019t want to steal any credit there). The cooks find my constant need to entertain her in itself entertaining, and I\u2019m glad we can provide some comic relief in all of this. When she\u2019s not feeling shy she will dance and insist that the cooks look at her iPad from time to time because sometimes a joke is so funny that it needs to be shared to really experience it, even when you\u2019re three. The restaurant is starting to feel more like home for her instead of just a place where Daddy takes her in between brunch and dinner while Katherine finishes her shift and I get ready for dinner service.A monster hiding in a pile of meatloaf sandwiches.\nPhoto by Katherine PangaroIt may be harder being one part chef, telling the cooks what to do, and two parts babysitter, making sure Barbara eats things other than the potato chips we use to lure her to the restaurant in the first place, but these are not ordinary times. Barbara being there means we all get to keep working and keep getting paid, and I think there is something reassuring about her presence. Maybe when we reopen she will have a permanent, though honorary (for legal purposes), job. Because while the restaurant feels hollow right now, it will feel even more lonely to be there without her when things go back to normal.Tonight at home we\u2019re going to make lamb dumplings and Barbara probably won\u2019t touch them, but she\u2019ll eat some broccoli (she\u2019s definitely my kid!) and be horrible at bedtime. And then I will drink too much vodka and remember to take my anti-anxiety medication, which seems to be the only reason this is not the craziest article ever written.Then we\u2019ll do it all over again tomorrow. And the next day. And the day after that. And eventually this will end, and we will have done everything we could to help the undocumented immigrants and first-line responders that do so much for us (frankly, the \u201ceverything we could do\u201d will likely have amounted to very little, and that is frustrating). We\u2019ll see what\u2019s become of restaurants and whether the independently owned ones like No. 7 have a place in it all. But I am relatively at peace waiting to find out what will happen. Because I have work to do, literal mouths to feed, and monsters to hunt with magic wands.Tyler Kord is the chef-owner of No 7.
