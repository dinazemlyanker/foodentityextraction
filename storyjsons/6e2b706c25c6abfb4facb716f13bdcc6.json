Have a question? Email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.Can I refuse the first table offered to me by a host or hostess? I\u2019m talking 6 p.m. on a Wednesday when there are plenty of tables available. \u2014Ill-seated StephI think you answered your own question there, Steph. Some restaurants plan tables to a T\u2014and when I was an editor\u2019s assistant I would request certain tables when I made reservations. (The one by the fireplace at The Lamb\u2019s Club, thanks!) However, it\u2019s not what you say but how you say it. Do you sneer and insult the manager, who is also a celebrated local artist, when you ask for \u201csomething farther away from the hideous portrait of nude George Costanza\u201d? Have a fantastic time, jerk! Or do you ask so kindly, so warmly, you sound like you\u2019re inviting the host over for dinner yourself? I think you can see the pattern here: BE NICE TO PEOPLE.Photo by Igor BastidasOften a waiter will ask if you want anchovies on your Caesar salad, but recently, a restaurant ended up charging me for them (without warning). In this scenario, can you ask for a charge to be taken off the bill? \u2014Negotiable NadeenI once heard a story about a rich and powerful man who had this mind-bending superpower: he could convince any waiter to take entire dishes off the bill that he deemed not very good. He\u2019d hand over his credit card and look them in the eye and say, \u201cand go ahead and take that pork chop off the bill\u2014I won\u2019t be paying for that.\u201d Can you imagine having that kind of nerve? I think about that a lot, about being a man. Annnyyway. Informing the server all innocently that you had no idea the anchovies on a Caesar salad would be extra, is fine. Come on, the salad is SUPPOSED to have anchovies. They\u2019d better be free! And if the server stands by the surcharge? Well, I hope the $2 won\u2019t keep you up at night. Global warming should!When getting out of your seat in a crowded restaurant where the tables are tightly packed, is it better to face your neighbor or to have your butt toward their table? \u2014Michael\u2019s on the MoveLet\u2019s be real: This depends on the size of your butt and where the wine glasses are placed on their table. You can do the math. I personally like to present my ass toward strangers to enhance their meal. It reminds me of when Winnie the Pooh got stuck in Rabbit\u2019s tree and Rabbit puts a frame around his ass and sets a table under it complete with flaming candelabra. Plus, my own friends have seen my butt plenty of times, it wouldn\u2019t be a new or engaging experience for them.Snack Break!This marinated manchego is like having a restaurant appetizer, but at home. Which means you can absolutely take the last bite instead of conceding it to your dining companion, who is a well-worn body pillow!Marinated ManchegoThe only thing more crowd-pleasing than cheese is marinated cheese.View RecipePhoto by Igor BastidasIs it ever okay to send a dish back simply because I didn\u2019t like it? \u2014Not-Into-It IgorNo\u2014that\u2019s how dining out (or going to the movies, or picking a college major) works. You\u2019re paying for something that is hopefully good but might not be. These are the ONLY situations in which you can send back a dish:The pork chop is rare.There\u2019s a piece of plastic in the ravioli.There are cashews in the salad, and you noted earlier that you are allergic.A black crow flies out of the pot pie.You\u2019re Gordon Ramsay.Photo by Igor BastidasIs it ever okay to order something off the menu, like a banana? \u2014Potassium-Deficient PattiIs banana the code word that gets you into the restaurant\u2019s cool new produce-and-bondage-themed underground freakeasy (freaky-speakeasy)? If so: Yes. If not: No way, Patti!!!!Photo by Igor BastidasCan I take home the basket of complimentary bread or what? \u2014Carbo-loading CameronDefinitely. Leave the actual basket behind, please and thanks.Is it ever okay to blow your nose at the table? \u2014Runny RomeoOnly if you\u2019re in the stages of the cold where it\u2019s runny and quiet, but not honky-holorky-flecka-flunka\u2014you know, the sound of a thick and muffly avalanche of boogers. That requires STAYING HOME. Also for goodness sake, bring Kleenex or a hankie and don\u2019t you dare use a CLOTH NAPKIN.Photo by Igor BastidasIs it okay to let kids watch an iPad at the table? \u2014Judgy JaneIt\u2019s sort of sad/sign of the times/yadda yadda. But parents hate when people tell them what to do, so as long as the kid has headphones in and isn\u2019t flinging peas in my general direction, she can watch The Wire for all I care.Photo by Igor BastidasHow can you ask the restaurant to turn down the music without being That Person? \u2014Jamming JosieScript: \u201cThis is soooo embarrassing to ask and I feel like such a loooooser, but would it be possible to turn the music down a SMIDGE?\u201d You MUST say the word SMIDGE in this scenario or it will never work.I want to pour my own wine at a fancy restaurant. Is that so wrong? \u2014Controlling ClaraFine, spill little trails of red wine on the white tablecloth, pour more for yourself than for Steven\u2014I see how it is. If serving your own vino is such a priority for you that you had to write me a letter about it, when the wine is corked and the server sets the bottle down after Pour No. 1, say, \u201cThank you so much; we\u2019ll pour it from here! Some of us are going to drink less than others tonight.\u201d And then glare at Steven menacingly. He\u2019s done nothing to deserve this.That\u2019s all for now, but if you have petty etiquette questions, recipe requests, or just want to tell me you think I\u2019m unfunny and WRONG, so wrong, about everything, please email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.Love, AlexExplore Bon App\u00e9titEtiquetteIs It Ever OkayRestaurantsRecipes you want to make.
