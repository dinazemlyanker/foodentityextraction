Inside was the one thing that had the power to stop my homesickness in its tracks: cheese curds. These particular curds came from a modern, green-roofed barn outside of Brodhead, Wisconsin called Decatur Dairy, a necessary stop on Owen family day trips for as long as I can remember.Let\u2019s get one thing straight: I\u2019m not the first to bow down to Decatur\u2019s cows. The Muenster has taken 1st place at the World Champion Cheese Contest \u2014 which the Dill Havarti has also placed in, FYI\u2014 and their Pepper Havarti brings locals and tourists in from all over the country.My family\u2019s perfect day kicks off with an hour-long drive to the Decatur barn, a spot you could easily miss if you weren\u2019t looking, but isn\u2019t that most of the rural Midwest? Come on a warm day and you\u2019ll be greeted by the cows grazing in the field next to the gravel parking lot. Inside, a handful of apron-clad cheese experts answer questions and provide recommendations in thick Wisconsin accents.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.The shop is cramped, the kind of place where you need to carve out somewhere to wait while your order is prepared. Shelves are lined with funny little souvenirs you\u2019ll only find in small-town Wisconsin: \u201cCow Pie\u201d candy, Wisconsin pride T-shirts, the occasional Green Bay Packer memorabilia. My advice: beeline for the cheese curd cooler to your left, proudly boasting \u201cCurd is the Word\u201d (my personal motto).The curd flavor variety is impressive: BBQ Mesquite, Buffalo, Cheddar, French Onion, Horseradish Bacon, Hot Salsa, Muenster, Jalape\u00f1o, White Garlic and Herb, Tomato Bacon Basil, White Bleu Cheese, Green Olive, and Ranch. Everyone knows a good curd squeaks as you eat it, but don\u2019t forget about flavor: too much and you can only handle one or two. Decatur Dairy\u2019s curds come with a quick punch of flavor that blends perfectly into the creamy interior; just enough to reel you in. It\u2019s near impossible to eat less than five. What sold me were the jalape\u00f1o curds, a strong flavor that has the potential to go oh-so wrong. Instead, they\u2019re a savory treat with a hint of spice that doesn\u2019t overwhelm your tastebuds.Wisconsin Master Cheesemaker Steve Stettler, center, and two employees mix the cheese curds at Decatur Dairy.\nPhoto by Anthony WahlCome hungry\u2014very hungry\u2014because the only thing better than the cheese curds are the $3 grilled cheese sandwiches they sling hot off of the grill next to the curd cooler. My summer is never complete without a Pickleicious, their award-winning Havarti with pickles and \u201cspecial sauce\u201d (a recipe I\u2019d group close to spicy mayo) on sourdough. It\u2019s the kind of melty mess that mixes cheesy, salty, and a touch of sweet so well. Months later, you\u2019ll wake up from a dead sleep craving it.You can buy Decatur cheeses by the pound (as well as online), along with specialty mustards and deli meats they have behind the counter, as well. If you're looking for inspiration, my go-to is always the same: one bag of jalape\u00f1o curds, a bag of cheddar curds, a solid block of Havarti Horseradish cheese, and a bit of Smoked Butterk\u00e4se.Once we pack the car with our cheese bounty, we\u2019re off to the nearest brewery, usually Minhas or New Glarus, to beer-flight it up until we inevitably pull out a bag of curds to snack on. If the weather is nice, we\u2019ll linger at New Glarus, where picnic tables overlook fields of farmland and a single country highway. This simple scene, to me, is my family at its best. And the cheese curds are a delicious, completely necessary, part of the equation.Photo by Alex LauBuy 12 oz. of Decatur cheese curds for $5.20 here (but one bag won't be enough...)Explore Bon App\u00e9titCheeseWisconsinRead MorecultureA Definitive Ranking of Cheddar Cheese CrackersBy Alyse Whitneyrecipes35 Cheesy Appetizers That Are Cheesier Than Your Uncle\u2019s JokesGallery35 SlidesBy Bon App\u00e9titcultureButterk\u00e4se: The Best Cheese You\u2019ve Never TriedBy Posie HarwoodRecipes you want to make.
