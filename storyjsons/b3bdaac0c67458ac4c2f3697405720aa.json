He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.The rules for the best BLTHow is it that we\u2019re creeping up on Labor Day and I\u2019ve yet to write about BLTs? I mean, seriously\u2014seems like someone has been shirking his responsibilities.What I do know is that I\u2019m out at the beach this week, and I intend to eat as many BLTs as possible. And here\u2019s how I\u2019ll be making mine (with some input from select friends and family):The BaconPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Susie TheodorouYes, I love a cast-iron skillet as much as everyone else at BA. But I\u2019m making my BLT bacon in the oven. Wire rack, set into a sheet tray, 400\u00b0. Never not perfect. And ideal for a crowd. And by \u201ccrowd,\u201d I\u2019m setting the bar at two people, because who ever eats just one homemade BLT?As for the bacon itself, I\u2019m fine with regular old supermarket bacon: crispy but not brittle. I\u2019ll save the super thick-cut stuff for steakhouse visits.Want this letter before it hits the website?

Shrettuce provides the crisp, coolness of iceberg without the whole-leaf slippage you often get when biting down on the sandwich.Occasionally, if I\u2019m feeling fancy\u2014or just at some creative sandwich shop\u2014I\u2019m okay with peppery arugula. It stands up nicely to the bacon. But please don\u2019t take this as a formal endorsement.TomatoPhoto by Adam RapoportWhen I go to the Gee Whiz diner near our office on a random (perhaps slightly hungover) Wednesday, and I\u2019m absolutely jonesing for a BLT, I\u2019m fine with a thoroughly underwhelming grocery-store variety of tomato.But this time of year, which is the only time I make BLTs at home, it\u2019s gotta be the real deal: plump, heavy heirloom tomatoes, streaked with yellow and blood red, maybe some purple or green. And when you slice into them with your serrated knife, their clear, fragrant juices pool up on your cutting board.One thing: Don\u2019t forget to salt your tomatoes when building your sandwich. Yes, bacon is salty, but tomatoes need their own attention. A little freshly cracked pepper never hurts, either.BreadOkay, here\u2019s where we\u2019re likely to disagree. Pursuits insist on white bread (toasted, obviously). And I get it\u2014when you look up BLT in a dictionary, that\u2019s what you\u2019ll see. But at some point in my life (perhaps during my years at the University of California at Berkeley; go Bears!), I became a multi-grain, whole-wheat guy. I want my bread to have heft and texture.In terms of wild card varieties, I\u2019m not mad at toasted ciabatta. It\u2019s basically white bread, but with attitude.ExtrasYou know what\u2019s better than a fried egg? A crispy fried egg.Alex LauMayo\u2014mayo, mayo, mayo. Top and bottom. I ride with Hellmann\u2019s, but when my Instagram friends down South DM me about Duke\u2019s, I\u2019m not one to argue. Just send me a case.And if my fancy friends want to whip up some herby, homemade aioli,, I won\u2019t argue with them, either.Avocado? I love avocado. On pretty much everything. But a peak-season BLT shouldn\u2019t need one. Middle of the winter? Different story.Egg. My wife loves a crispy, olive oil-fried egg on her BLT. Bite into the sandwich, and the yolks runs down the layers of bacon. Kind of genius. But when I\u2019m making BLTs for a crowd (see above), you know what I don\u2019t have time to do? Make crispy, olive oil-fried eggs.
