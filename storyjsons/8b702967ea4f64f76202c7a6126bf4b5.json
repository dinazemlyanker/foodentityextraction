For years, I lived in a Brooklyn studio apartment with my partner and four bikes. \u201cDo we want a dining table or a real bed?\u201d we asked, a very real game of \u201cWould You Rather?\u201dMy design daydreams center around a big, heavy wooden dining table, preferably with expansive leaves, just because we could. And that was exactly the first thing we bought when we moved into a one-bedroom apartment. Next, I set the table with a woven runner, a few flower vases, and a tray at one end holding a tiny sailboat, a few rocks, and a hand-embroidered postcard. Because a dinner table is a gathering place, and I like to decorate mine with reminders of where I\u2019ve been with people I love. The \u201cdinner table souvenir\u201d scene is as much as conversation starter as a comforting reminder of some of the best moments of my life\u2014and I like to keep those close at hand.Sit at our table, and you\u2019ll find a map of our travels carefully placed in front of you. The most prominent (pictured up top) is a pair of planters, originally intended as bookends, housing colorful cacti, discovered at an Of a Kind sample sale. Next to that, you\u2019ll find a round, black-and-white swirled candle holder from Reykjavik (it reminded us of the black sand beaches in V\u00edk). Leaning against the planters, an antique silver tip plate from Charleston flanked by a pair of wooden salt-and-pepper shakers from Uganda. Pulling it all together is an embroidered postcard from Norway, and miniature model boat from Iceland named Litli.A small selection of my dining table souvenir collection, including a postcard from a museum in Norway, an antique silver tipping plate from Charleston.\nJoseph GonzalezThis scene is constantly changing, depending on anything from the weather to the people we\u2019re hosting. Think of it as a manifestation of a phone background or computer desktop image; giving your eyes some variety is always a good thing. The mementos of vacation provide a dose of nostalgia or wanderlust, a welcomed distraction from the chaos of the city outside. Being able to pay a mental visit to a my favorite places with the help of a dining room trinket is something that has helped me appreciate my travels more\u2014and has simultaneously made dinnertime more fun.It doesn\u2019t have to be much to set up your own scene at home: a framed postcard, carefully carved serving spoons, hand-dyed napkins, a hearty succulent housed in a small planter from a far-flung flea market. This is more than a centerpiece; you\u2019re going for a burst of personality, not your great-aunt\u2019s tablescape. Get as far away from that latter as you possibly can. Here\u2019s how:Grab 2-5 things that remind you of your favorite placesDon\u2019t worry about consistency. It\u2019s the idea that pulls everything together. Feel free to play with different colors, sizes, shapes, materials\u2014the world is your souvenir-buying oyster. Maybe one of our souvenirs is an oyster shell.My glass container is currently filled with colorful terrazzo scraps, but it\u2019s housed dried flowers and volcanic rocks in the past.\nJoseph GonzalezFollow the rule of thirdsThe rule of thirds works with more than photographs. If you\u2019re looking to take up minimal space with your scene, stick to three items and make sure they\u2019re all different heights. Science says that eyeballs are into that kind of thing.Say yes to clear containersGlass canisters make great homes for rocks, shells, or sand...I\u2019m partial to these decorative glass canisters from IKEA in pretty, muted colors. We\u2019ve got the pink one set up on our dining room table filled with beautiful scrap pieces of terrazzo from English designer Katie Gillies (they remind me of a caf\u00e9 I love in Portugal).Be choosy about what you displayDon\u2019t feel the pressure to display all of your souvenirs at once; pick a few from places that you\u2019re particularly missing at the moment and work with those. I store the rest of my tchotchkes on a designated closet shelf. Lacking space? Find other places around your home to display souvenirs (think: the top of your bathroom vanity or a small shelf in your kitchen).Make Lazy Susan your friendIf you\u2019ve got a small table, look to your friend lazy susan. Grab your favorite candle and build around it: try a beautiful matchbook from a bar visited on a recent trip or a tiny vase from a pottery studio you stumbled upon.Consider this an official excuse to plan a vacation\u2014and buy yourself a few extra souvenirs.Erika Owen is the associate director of audience development for Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious, as well as a writer and design enthusiast.
