In this recipe, a favorite on his Thanksgiving table, Som uses thinly sliced rounds of sweet potato tossed in brown butter spiked with ginger, miso, dark soy sauce, and five-spice powder. \u201cMade of fennel seeds, cinnamon, cloves, star anise, and Sichuan peppercorns, five-spice is infinitely versatile,\u201d he says. \u201cIt brings warmth to whatever I\u2019m making. I like to say it\u2019s pumpkin spice\u2019s bolder cousin.\u201d Stacking the slices so they stand upright on their sides (rather than flat against the pan) exposes their edges to the heat of the oven, allowing them to become crispy and intensely flavorful. If you can\u2019t find dark soy sauce, you can substitute 2 Tbsp. regular soy sauce plus \u00bc tsp. granulated sugar.For the rest of Som\u2019s Thanksgiving menu, see his recipes for Asian Pear Salad With Peanut-Lime Dressing, Roasted Brussels Sprouts With Gochujang Brown Butter, Dutch Oven No Mai Fan, Char Siu Wellington, and Milk Tea Bread Pudding With Cr\u00e8me Anglaise.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I didn\u2019t have a cast iron skillet so used a ceramic pie pan.  I couldn\u2019t find garlic so replaced them with a diced onion.  I had a jar of red miso so used it.   After turning up the oven, the crust burnt so I discontinued baking after 20 minutes.   \n\nI would use it anytime other than Thanksgiving or Christmas.  Lady MarieOlympia, WA12/28/2021Very pretty presentation but the taste was not great - had way too much leftovers vs candied sweet potatoes - might try with candied recipe but with the slicesjkLong Beach, CA12/7/2021Perhaps sliced a tad too thin, but was able to make a pretty rosace and the flavor is insane!  A keeper! Donna CMooresville, Iredell, North Carolina, USA11/29/2021This was wonderful. A big hit at Thanksgiving with friends. I used 2 kinds of sweet potatoes so it looked like a flower. Will definitely make it again.ValerieSummit Hill PA11/27/2021This looks great! I plan to make it this coming week before Thanksgiving when we have company for dinner. We love sweet potatoes and I am always looking for new ways to prepare them.\nAnd a note to GLEE in Kailua, HI - I agree, sweet potatoes are really hard. I plan to use my mandoline, which is really sharp, to slice them. It can slice from 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch slices. I never thought I needed one until I got this one as a gift many years ago - now I use it all the time!MichelleAnderson, SC11/20/2021A huge hit! The depth of flavor was amazing and it was not complicated to make. This will be my new go-to sweet potato dish for Thanksgiving/Friendsgiving. JeannieNew York, NY11/20/2021This sounds delicious, and I will try it soon. In answer to the previous question, the only way I would slice them is with a mandoline, which enables you to slice the sweet potatoes uniformly and thinly. AnonymousMontana11/12/2021Sweet potatoes are like rocks. How do you safely slice them like this when raw? But it sounds delish.gleeKailua, HI11/2/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titSweet PotatoThanksgivingSideVegetarianRoastDinnerFallWinterRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
