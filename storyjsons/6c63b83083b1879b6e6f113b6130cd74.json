Seems like that may be the case. Other recipes call for 1:1:1 ratio of black, glutinous and regular jasmine rice or something similar. MI4/21/2020Only a low rating because BA has the ratios of rice backward, must be in a typo. Same issue in the magazine edition as well. Should be 1 Cup sweet rice, 3 tbsp Black Glutinous rice.

Should the recipe call for 1 cup of sweet rice and 3 tbps. of black rice?Las Vegas Nevada 4/21/2020This looks great! Can\u2019t wait to make it. But looking at the photo, it seems there is more sweet rice than black rice. Is the ratio of black rice to sweet rice that the recipe calls for correct? It seems like the recipe should call for 1 cup sweet rice and 3 Tbps. of black rice....AnonymousLas Vegas Nevada 4/21/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titAsianRiceRice & GrainsEasySideVeganVegetarianGluten-FreeDairy-FreeNut-FreeSteamLunar New YearDinnerRecipes you want to make.
