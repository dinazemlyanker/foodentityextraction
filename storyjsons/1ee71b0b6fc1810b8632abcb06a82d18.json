But what if you\u2019re already a professional chef? The standard stays the same.By Caf\u00e9 AppliancesDecember 4, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailMokbar\u2019s Esther Choi and personal chef Brandon Crowe spend their careers in kitchens, so unsurprisingly, their food and service philosophies spill over into their at-home entertaining. While menu inspirations vary, there is a natural overlap that you'd expect from professional chefs. They both rely on what\u2019s in season, and each is hyper-organized. Brandon likes to be 80 percent finished cooking by the time guests arrive. \u201dI\u2019m still in the kitchen cooking, but I\u2019m not so busy I can\u2019t have a glass of wine and conversation with them,\u201d he says. Esther makes sauces, chops veggies, and, of course, does all the shopping ahead of time. \u201cYou never have enough time the day of, so make sure you already have everything you need at home. Otherwise, it\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d she says with a telling laugh that she\u2019s learned from experience.For both chefs, family-style is the way to go. \u201cWe\u2019re big on collaboration in the kitchen,\u201d Brandon says of the parties he and his wife like to host. \u201cI think guests enjoy feeling like they learned something, even if it\u2019s simple, that they can incorporate into their cooking at home.\u201d He notes that he\u2019s fortunate to have a great home kitchen\u2013\u2013a large workspace and island countertop\u2013\u2013that was designed with his and his wife\u2019s love of entertaining in mind.\u201cI take a lot of pride in the design elements of my home,\u201d he says, explaining that what he appreciates about the Caf\u00e9 Modern Glass Collection, the array of smart, chef-inspired appliances meant to reflect one\u2019s personal style, is their effortless minimalism. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to be said about appliances with a clean, understated design. When they\u2019re high-performing, they don\u2019t need to be flashy.\u201dBoth Brandon, who is anti serving plated food at dinner parties, and Esther agree that immersive dining experiences are the most fun. \u201cAsian food is very interactive,\u201d says Esther, whose professional specialty is Korean food. \u201cPeople usually want to get their hands dirty with me.\u201d She leans into dishes like dumplings with a variety of fillings, cooked different ways, or hot pot. \u201cI set out pots of boiling stock and lots of seasonal veggies\u2013\u2013whatever is fresh at the market\u2013\u2013plus upscale meat like Wagyu and a nice seafood variety like scallops or head-on shrimp. I\u2019ll have noodles and at least four or five dipping sauces. It\u2019s the ultimate hot pot experience.\u201dFor Esther, smart, innovative appliances could work wonders for her dinner parties. \u201cI need to be able to control the temperature and turn off my oven from my phone,\u201d she says, referring to the Wi-Fi\u2013enabled feature on Caf\u00e9 Modern Glass ranges. \u201cIf I need to run errands, I don\u2019t want to have to babysit a roast that\u2019s going to take four hours. Timing and control are very important when you\u2019re hosting a dinner party because you have a million things you need to do!\u201dThe two chefs also agree that the most important element of a dinner party is making guests feel comforted. Brandon explains: \u201cIn my work as a personal chef, sometimes that hour\u2013\u2013breakfast, lunch, or dinner\u2013\u2013is the only hour where they can forget about their email or put down their phones. I want to create a familial environment where everyone can relax, and I do the same for my dinner parties: hope they forget about everything else and just be completely satisfied with the food, drinks, and company.\u201dEsther, who learned to cook from her grandmother, still models her cooking after the lessons she learned when she was a child. \u201cMy grandmother believed that when you\u2019re hosting, you're cooking for those people; you\u2019re pouring your whole heart and soul into every part of the meal, from the menu planning to buying and cooking the ingredients, right down to clearing the plates,\u201d she says. \u201cAt the end of the night, I want people to have the feeling of a happy belly and soul, to feel like they just ate at their grandma\u2019s place.\u201dEven when they\u2019re off duty, these professional chefs don\u2019t stop thinking about food\u2013\u2013how it builds new relationships and connects existing ones. But with a little help from the right appliances, it makes entertaining a little easier, and more stylish too.Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
