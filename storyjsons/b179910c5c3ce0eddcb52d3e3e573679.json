Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,This week\u2019s new recipe is another weeknight hit from Andy Baraghani: Salt and Pepper Fish. It\u2019s as simple as it sounds, and the buttery seasoned rice that goes with it might replace Chris Morocco\u2019s sushi rice as my default rice recipe (don\u2019t tell Chris). From the looks of things on Instagram, you all are still hung up on Andy\u2019s cabbage, but I hope you\u2019ll give the fish a try next. (Pairs well with cheap light beer and the new Nicolas Jaar album.)Also on Healthyish, Zoe Yang wrote a beautiful personal essay about coronavirus, Wuhan noodles, and the time she spent living in China. Her piece didn't mention this, but Chinese-American restaurants across the country are suffering from lack of business as a result of coronavirus fears. I've made a point of eating in Manhattan's Chinatown more often than usual, and I encourage you to do the same in your city.Last night, when I was supposed to be writing this newsletter, I was watching Miss Americana, the new Taylor Swift documentary on Netflix. To be honest, I hadn\u2019t thought about Taylor Swift in a minute. I had a brief time with her music about six years ago, when 1989 came out and I\u2019d just moved (back) to New York newly single, and that album and the show Girls felt like guilty pleasures I didn\u2019t want to admit I loved. And, soon enough, I stopped loving them. Partly because I aged out of pop music and TV shows about post-college malaise, but more because it was something I knew I needed to do.I won\u2019t recount all the reasons why everyone started hating Dunham and Swift\u2014honestly, I don\u2019t remember the details\u2014but around the same time they became the poster women for clueless, navel-gazing, white privilege: a quality that, especially amid the 2016 presidential election, became impossible to excuse. (Didn\u2019t they even hate each other for a while? I\u2019ve never been able to keep track.) Since then, Dunham has more or less exited stage right\u2014like, literally, she moved to Wales. Swift, on the other hand, has stayed in the spotlight, recording two records, touring internationally, and filming this documentary.Like Lady Gaga\u2019s and Beyonce\u2019s before it, Swift\u2019s documentary is billed as the first real, unfiltered look into the superstar\u2019s life. But as BuzzFeed writer Pier Dominguez put it, Miss Americana is less of a documentary and more of \u201ca humanizing infomercial.\u201d From the first shots of Swift sitting by a window, reading from her diary, the film\u2019s point is hammered home: She always wanted to be seen as a good girl, and everything she did\u2014her career, her body, her dating life, her political opinions\u2014served that goal. The rest of the documentary lays out the case for how Swift has changed. We\u2019re shown how her songwriting has gotten more honest, she\u2019s stopped starving herself, she\u2019s taken some political stances...she even put the cast of Queer Eye in a music video!I identify with Taylor Swift\u2019s good girl persona more than I\u2019d like to admit, and that\u2019s why I found the documentary so disappointing: She\u2019s so clearly still trying to be good. One of the first skills that good girls learn is how to read the room. In Swift\u2019s case, the room is very big, like the-entirety-of-American-pop-culture big. But the room\u2019s priorities are clear: These days we want our celebrities to have opinions. We want them to show their imperfections. We want \u201cauthenticity.\u201d We want them to talk about #MeToo. And, right on cue, here\u2019s the new Taylor Swift: wearing sweatpants and a messy ponytail and having some opinions, talking about her disordered eating and her sexual harassment case, hugging drag queens, and disagreeing with her dad when he tells her not to talk politics on Instagram.That conversation pits Swift and her mom (and her cat?) on a couch facing her dad and an unnamed white man across from them. The optics are clear, but Swift drives the point home, saying that she doesn\u2019t want to end up on the wrong side of history. It\u2019s one of the most honest lines in the film. Swift doesn\u2019t want to be on the wrong side of history because she never wants to be wrong, because wrong is embarrassing. Wrong is bad.The other line I found most telling comes toward the end, when Swift makes the astute observation that women pop stars, unlike men, have to keep reinventing themselves to stay relevant. The good girl has to become the bad girl who has to become the chastened girl who has to become the enlightened girl...until you\u2019re too old to be a girl and people stop paying attention at all. Swift, back in the window and surrounded by her diaries, says she wants to keep doing what she\u2019s doing \u201cwhile people still tolerate me being successful.\u201dAnd so here she is at 30, reinventing herself and hoping we\u2019ll approve.As a reward for getting to the end of this extra-long newsletter, here is a very good (possibly the very best) boy:ADAM HUNGER/USA TODAY SPORTSUntil next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish EditorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletteressayRecipes you want to make.
