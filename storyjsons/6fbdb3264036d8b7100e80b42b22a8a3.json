But the hot honey we make for these wings go beyond the usual sweet and spicy notes, with the addition of chili crisp and lime. It\u2019s the cherry on top of these supremely crispy yet low-fuss grilled wings. The secret lies in the prep. Cooking wings low and slow in the oven before grilling is a controversial ask, but hear us out: This allows the excess fat in the wings to render so it\u2019s not dripping into the grill and causing flareups. (Bonus: This means you can prep these wings ahead of time. (You\u2019re welcome!) Once roasted in the oven, toss the wings in a hot honey glaze and finish directly on the grill over medium heat. \u2014Jessie YuChenAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

The meal was delicious and the presentation was great.  Thanks, BA!LeeJacksonville, FL 2/22/2022This was such a fun, balanced recipe. I think fish sauce might be the most underrated ingredient of all time and chili crisp is my new favorite ingredient. Delicious!Warren BuckJacksonville, FL12/31/2021This is an absolute favorite! How have I lived without chili crisp my whole life?!Juju kennett square pa12/28/2021In the video they used Lao Gan Ma chili crisp. I got mine from WegmansJessicaQueens, NY9/6/2021WAY too much black pepper in the rub. Couldn\u2019t taste anything else Jean 9/5/2021Yes, WHAT is chilli crisp\nWendyAustralian 8/17/2021What is chili crisp??Leon8/3/2021We didn\u2019t grill but they were still tasty. One thing though, we used cayenne as we didn\u2019t have Thai bird chilies and yowza! They were spicy! But oh so yummy!! \n\nSuper easy and we will make them again as the family really enjoys the flavor profile. AnonymousNew York, NY8/2/2021This is a new go to recipe! Pre-baking the chicken was a game changer- it was so juicy. Excellent summer meal!GrillingInSeattleSeattle, WA7/28/2021Don't have a grill, forgot the shishitos, and these were still A+. We find that a lot of recipes with a sweet element usually lean too hard on the sweet for our taste, so for a little over 2 pounds of wings, I used just under 1/2 C of wings (maybe closer to a 1/3 C), doubled the lime, added just a splash extra of fish sauce, and sprinkled in some chili flakes (our chili crisp is savory and delightful but not super hot). For the dry rub, subbed about half the cayenne for chipotle powder to help get that smokey taste. Really tasty, forgiving, and riffable.NytashaOakland7/20/2021Is 375 degrees correct?  That does not sound like \"low and slow\" to me!David RosenthalOakland, CA7/13/2021Amazing! I made these and served them with steamed artichokes, and a dry Riesling, it was the best finger food night ever!Kari L.Napa, CA7/10/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titChicken WingChickenPoultryShishito PepperVegetableThai ChileChileJalape\u00f1oPeanutNutMainStarterDairy-FreeGluten-FreeGrillingDinnerRecipes you want to make.
