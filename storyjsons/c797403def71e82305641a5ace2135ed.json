See our past recommendations here!The year is 2019, and the options for using CBD are endless. It can be inhaled and stirred into coffee, shaken into cocktails, and added to desserts. But for sore muscles, period cramps, and other physical ailments, I use something that goes right on the skin.We love it: CBD+ Cool Stick, $25Unlike the luxe infused treats bouncing around your Instagram feed, topical CBD treatments bypass the bloodstream and digestive system to immediately get to work on targeted areas. Like all cannabis, research surrounding topical CBD is limited. But preliminary studies have been promising, and so have my personal results.After a year of use, Wildflower's Cool Stick is an essential part of my physical-care routine. The muscle rub suspends full-spectrum CBD oil in a moisturizing blend of shea butter, coconut oil, and hemp oil. Peppermint and arnica create an instant cooling sensation for immediate relief, and, within a few minutes, I\u2019m more comfortable. I love it for post-yoga stiffness; my boyfriend religiously uses it to ease his lower back pain after long runs. The strong menthol scent conjures up memories of the drugstore muscle rubs at high school track and field practice, with one big difference: this stuff really works. \u2013  Aliza Abarbanel, Healthyish editorial assistant.Buy it: CBD+ Cool Stick, $25All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
