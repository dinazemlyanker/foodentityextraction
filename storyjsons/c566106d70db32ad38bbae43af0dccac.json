It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Sunset on summerFor some, fall\u2019s first sighting of curled, browning, and desiccated leaves is a time of great joy. I\u2019m not one of those people. My son peeks his head out of his teen-emo cave to happily refer to the colder, shorter days as \u201choodie season.\u201d If you follow a lot of food people on Instagram, you\u2019ve recently seen posts from comrades on the west coast who are excited about pink-fleshed apples, and others baking Italian plums into buttery cakes. Maybe those people are sick of summer or maybe they\u2019re cold-blooded animals to start with, but the fact is, we all eventually have to come to grips with Summer\u2019s Bittersweet Demise.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Usually, I fight the coming wave of darkness. I buy flats of tomatoes and make giant batches of sauce for the freezer. I talk crap about the new-crop apples that everyone\u2019s in a frenzy over, and throw a backyard grilling party instead. But this year, I\u2019m going to try to embrace the golden hour that\u2019s upon us by making Andy Baraghani\u2019s very simple, very beautiful cake that has always reminded me of a big, fat, gorgeous sunset. This cake gets its sunny flavor from citrus, cardamom, and bay leaf, richness from yogurt in the batter, and its orange hue from semolina, which is a coarse version of the same wheat flour used to make pasta. Its flavor is mild, but the texture it gives the cake is unmistakable and worth seeking out (check a Middle Eastern grocer or a well-stocked bulk bin aisle). Even when baked, the semolina keeps its crunch, and gives the outside of this cake a sturdy crust, reminding me of the brittle dry wind that will soon be whipping through my nostrils and causing my knuckles to crack open.Cut into the cake though, and there is a moist dense crumb within, imbued with flavor from the bay leaf simple syrup that\u2019s poured over the top when it comes out of the oven, and then left to soak in while it cools. The sweet citrusy flavor reminds me of a Creamsicle, and the warm, slightly sticky texture reminds me of the insane humidity of New York City in August.I hear you out there, questioning the sanity of a woman recommending a citrus cake in the middle of the fall harvest when there\u2019s late-season stone fruit still available, fat figs around the corner, and\u2014yes\u2014fresh-picked apples at the market. I\u2019d rather just rip the Band-Aid off this whole transition and go straight to winter, okay? Sue me.I\u2019m not good with change, in general, and I\u2019m really not good with any kind of change that is followed by five long months of root vegetables, because that\u2019s what\u2019s coming after this brief fall harvest hoo-ha. I\u2019m trying to not mourn summer. I want to honor it with an extended sunset, in cake form. After all, I may or may not have bought some 2018-season apples myself this weekend, and it\u2019s possible I made a giant pot of bean soup, too. Might as well get this over with.Get the recipe:Semolina Cake with OrangesExplore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
