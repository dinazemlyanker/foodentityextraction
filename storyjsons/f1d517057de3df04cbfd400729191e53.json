(They\u2019ll never reach this magical place of course, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to strive.)When he was developing our newest, greatest stuffing, flavored with herbs (parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme), fennel, onion, and celery, senior food editor Andy Baraghani reflected on all the stuffings he\u2019d tried over the years\u2014hopping from stuffing to stuffing to stuffing\u2014in order to create our ultimate Franken-stuffing, which combines the very best features from stuffings past.The recipe thus serves as a compendium of our favorite stuffing techniques, those that have survived the test of time (and the test of the test kitchen). Best of all, you can apply them to nearly any bread-based stuffing, whether you\u2019re using Andy\u2019s recipes or a family heirloom. We hereby decree our six rules to the best stuffing ever:Get out all of your Thanksgiving angst!\nPhoto by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen Kaminski1. Tear, don\u2019t cut, your bread. Irregular torn pieces, as opposed to neat cubes, create extra texture and surface area for browning, making for a more beautiful stuffing. (Yes, stuffing can be beautiful.) It\u2019ll let out some of your Thanksgiving stress to rip apart that loaf, and the crevices on each craggy chunk are the perfect crannies for chopped vegetables and torn herbs to nestle into.2. Don\u2019t stale the bread\u2014dry it out in the oven. Dehydrating the bread removes moisture, effectively transforming it into a sponge that can absorb all of the flavors of the stock and aromatics. We don\u2019t recommend letting your bread become stale at air temperature, though\u2014it\u2019s time-consuming and unreliable. Instead, tear it, then cook it in a low-temp oven (between 200\u00b0 and 250\u00b0) until crouton-like in texture but without taking on any color (about 45 minutes to 1 hour).3. Lean into the aromatics. Now\u2019s not the time to skimp on the vegetables and herbs that go into the stock mixture. We use onion, fennel, celery, parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme so that once-neutral bread becomes anything but.4. Use eggs, stock, and butter too. Egg is a binder, adding richness and body; stock moistens and flavors the bread; and butter is our fat of choice: It enhances browning, both on the top crust and the bottom floor, and makes the interior tender. Too much cream, on the other hand, can mute the flavors of the stock and turn the stuffing into something more akin to a pudding.Pressing (not mushing!).\nPhoto by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen Kaminski5. Don\u2019t mush; do press. We\u2019ll admit that it\u2019s a fine distinction, but what we mean is this: When you pour the stock and eggs over the bread and saut\u00e9ed vegetables, use a big spoon or a spatula to gently fold everything together. Your goal here is to make sure the pieces of bread are evenly coated, but you don\u2019t want to break them apart into crumbs or mash them into a paste. Then, after transferring the mixture to the baking dish(es), press the mixture down to pack it into the pan so that it all melds together into a scoopable stuffing. (Press gently\u2014you still don\u2019t want to lose the integrity of the chunks.)6. Smaller vessels mean more crispy edges. Lots of stuffing recipes call for 3- or 4-quart casserole dishes. You can, of course, bake your stuffing in one large dish, but splitting the stuff between two 8x8s allows for more perimeter pieces to go around\u2014plus, you\u2019ll have a dish for either end of the table, which means one less thing for everyone to fight about.Get the recipe:Classic Herb and Fennel StuffingThis goes out to all those whose Thanksgiving isn\u2019t Thanksgiving without a craggy-topped, herb-infused, crusty-bread-based stuffing.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titStuffingThanksgivingCooking TipsRead Morecooking25 Kitchen Upgrades for Under $25By Alex DelanyRecipes you want to make.
