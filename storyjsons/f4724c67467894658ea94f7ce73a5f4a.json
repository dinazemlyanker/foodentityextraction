I added a clove of garlic. When I took them out of the boiling water, I plopped em in a strainer and sprayed with a little warm water to keep them from sticking. Topped with fried onions and garlic alongside a crunchy salad. JosieChicago2/16/2021There's quite a bit of ginger in these! The next time I make it (which I will definitely be doing) I'll probably halve the ginger and keep the shrimp out of the food processor for more texture. I might also add some garlic in the filling to cut the strength of the ginger and provide more depth to the mix.abigailbarr12/7/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titDumplingChineseEast AsianAsianShrimpShellfishSeafoodStarterSimmerLunar New YearDinnerRecipes you want to make.
