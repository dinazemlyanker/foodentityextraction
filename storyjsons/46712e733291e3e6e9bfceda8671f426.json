The green beans cook fast\u2014we\u2019re talking 3 minutes\u2014and achieve my ideal tender-yet-crisp happy place. Here the beans are seasoned with a spicy Southeast Asian\u2013inspired sauce that counters the slightly sweet coconutty tofu. The fish sauce is optional but highly recommended. \u2014Sarah JampelAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Thank you\nSarinesNewport, RI3/7/2022We LOVE this recipe. I've made so many Bon Appetit recipes and my partner said this was her absolute favorite. Instead of sambal, I used half gochujang, half sriracha. I think the fish sauce IS necessary. It was wonderful, not too hard (esp with two working on it) and it definitely delivered. Vietnamese/Malaysian vibes. So good!!! Kara T.Atlanta, GA12/3/2021It's always fun to find a new way to cook tofu!  We make this without the sambal oelek because I'm avoiding peppers.  It's still good.  Anonymous10/30/2021This was good, with notes. As predicted, the coconut burned immediately upon hitting the pan, so next time I might heat that separately, but I also don't think it added much coconut flavor. Maybe coconut milk to the sauce would work, or coconut rice. I also doubled the sauce, because I love sauce, and even then it quickly evaporated. I thought the flavor of the sambal olek was delicious. I added the fish sauce because I love it. Will make again!nilssons9/29/2021My boyfriend and I have been trying to incorporate more non-meat dishes into our repertoire, and this coconut tofu stir fry is going to become one of our new favorites. It was worth tracking down the Sambal Oelek because the sauce is SO good. While I loved this recipe, I think the only thing it is missing is a crunch element (the coconut doesn't cut it for me). The next time I make this, I'm going to add more fresh lime before serving, and possibly throw some chopped scallions or crunchy onion bits on top. Also, be careful, coconut flakes can burn very quickly if you don't keep your eyes on them!DanielleWashington, D.C.9/16/2021A keeper recipe! Add one Thai chili for a buzzy mouthfeel. Didn't have coconut flakes, but used coconut oil for the slightly nutty flavoring.MaddieToronto, ON9/10/2021Absolutely loved this! Didn\u2019t change a thing. Better than the last Chinese food I bought. The sauce is excellent and the tofu makes you forget it is a meatless dish. Definite keeper that I will put on the rotation.AnonymousMiddletown NY9/7/2021I'm clearly making this again! The tofu was nice to have as a low-fat protein option, but the sauce, lime and basil really made the beans pop. Might need to add more coconut next time because the flavor was lost but in the end I didn't miss it. Makes for a light lunch or dinner.Ava9/5/2021Genuinely did not expect this to turn out as good as it did. Only mods I made: I have super dark soy sauce so cut back that amount, used a TBS instead of water when steaming the beans, and added some coconut cream to the sauce in lieu of flakes as I hate the texture. Very well balanced. BilliePittsburgh, PA9/5/2021I\u2019ve completely ruined the issue that has this recipe in it from making it so many times. One refinement I make is to add some black sugar to the coconut and toast it in the flash fried and then add it to the top during plating. I  also sprinkle a few fried shallots and sesame seeds on top. I loved serving this dish with the watermelon and snap pea salad. I use snow peas instead and add Korean soybean spouts.KarenAugusta, Georgia8/27/2021I substituted sweet peppers because string beans were the only thing I didn\u2019t have in the house! It\u2019s delicious!  Absolutely delicious & delightful & flavorful recipe I am making it again with the string beans in a few days!  Juliet PanebiancoFlorida 8/27/2021This sounded good when I read the recipe but it was even more delicious than I expected! The heat, salt and acid (with an extra squirt of lime for serving) were really well balanced. I made it exactly as written but might try it with a little less oil just to cut down the fat calories. (It didn't taste \"fatty.\") I will definitely make it again!JulianSanta Cruz, CA8/26/2021Delicious! Made for myself and for my boyfriend (24m). We both loved it and there is enough leftover for lunch for me tomorrow. I would suggest turning down the stove a bit when you add the sambal mixture. It cooks quickly and can create some spicy smoke.lemurlovrRaleigh, NC8/25/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titGreen BeanVegetableCoconutFruitTofuOther IngredientsStir-FryDinnerVegetarianGluten FreeVeganRecipes you want to make.
