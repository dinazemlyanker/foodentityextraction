The thing is, Alex Beggs did a lot of research, consulted experts, made several rounds of dough, and is generally fabulous. And she also has a pasta roller.Maybe you, too, are generally fabulous but you don\u2019t have a pasta roller or the several hours it takes to research and execute fresh dough. Yet you still want homemade pasta because, as Selena says, the heart wants what it wants. In that case, I\u2019m proposing ricotta gnocchi. Little pillowy dumplings made from a mixture of fresh ricotta (i.e. not salata), flour, parmesan, and eggs, they require neither machine nor rolling pin. With your bare (clean!) hands, you can make them from start to finish in about 30 minutes as long as you don\u2019t dilly-dally.Gnocchi is a broad category of small, chubby, soft pastas with many variations within Italy and also all over the world, from Brazil to Somalia. Gnocchi can be made from semolina flour, cornmeal, breadcrumbs, or polenta, among other ingredients. (In France, gnocchis \u00e0 la parisienne is made from choux pastry, the same dough used to make \u00e9clairs and cream puffs!)When it comes to choosing what sort of gnocchi to make, ricotta is reliable and forgiving. For potato gnocchi, you must first boil and rice potatoes. But ricotta gnocchi\u2014called ndunderi in Amalfi where they originated\u2014can be mixed and shaped immediately. And while potato gnocchi have a tendency to become gummy or leaden when weighed down with flour or over-handled, ricotta gnocchi are more foolproof. Mix together the dough, roll into strands, cut strands into nubs, and boil.These aren\u2019t as creamy and light as ricotta gnudi, named \u201cnaked\u201d because they resemble the inside of a ravioli filling and are just barely bound together. And that gives these ricotta gnocchi a distinct advantage! They\u2019re not so delicate that they fall apart when tossed with sauce. Pair them with a buttery sauce of peas and herbs if you\u2019re grasping for springtime feelings, or go with marinara, pesto, or sage/rosemary/thyme and brown butter. You can even toss the gnocchi with a bit of olive oil and grated mozzarella, transfer to an oven-safe dish or skillet, and bake until the cheese is melted and bubbling.You can also freeze your uncooked gnocchi on a lined baking sheet, then transfer them to a container or plastic bag when they\u2019re frozen solid. Tuck it in the back of the freezer for a night when you need dinner in 15 minutes flat. Because homemade pasta never tastes better than when you were expecting to be eating a bowl of popcorn instead.Get the recipe:Springy Ricotta Gnocchi With Peas and HerbsIf you\u2019ve ever been intimidated by the thought of making fresh pasta at home, look no further. Ricotta gnocchi is simple to make, and it\u2019s faster and more foolproof than its potato counterparts. The only tricky part is adding enough flour so that your dough is easy to work with, but not so much that it becomes stodgy or tough. If you don't want to make the buttery herb and pea sauce, use whatever you'd prefer, be it marinara, pesto, or sage and brown butter.\u00a0View RecipeRecipes you want to make.
