Lambert/Getty Images\u00a0FacebookTwitterEmailWelcome to \u201cIs It Ever Okay,\u201d Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s questionable etiquette column. Have a question? Email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.Can we share plates/utensils/drinks again? Can we do that thing where you and a friend each order a cocktail and you\u2019d say, \u201cooh what\u2019d you get?\u201d and you\u2019d have a sip of their drink and they\u2019d sip yours and you wouldn\u2019t give each other a life-threatening virus? \u2014Intrigued IagoYes, but I don\u2019t share my martini with anyone, so please don\u2019t ask me for a taste. It tastes like cold gin and it\u2019s mine. Also a rule: You can\u2019t \u201cshare\u201d fries if you didn\u2019t discuss the sharing before the fries were ordered. So if your friend ordered a burger that came with fries, and you had the nerve to order a garden salad with secret intentions to eat all of those fries, crawling your hand over to the plate like a midnight cockroach\u2014no. None of that shall be tolerated, and since we haven\u2019t seen each other in a while, I\u2019m going to snap at you and blame it on my pandemic loss of social skills.However! All along, germs were lurking. Remember the cold? Mono? Cold sores? CROUP? (I know three parents with kids who have croup right now and gave it to the whole family. It\u2019s going around!) There\u2019s a speckle of risk when we decide to share, and most of the time, I\u2019m willing to take it. Wash your hands before you eat, for goodness\u2019s sake! And remember that you\u2019re not invincible. When a friend supposedly \u201chas allergies,\u201d don\u2019t get the nachos. Play it safe.I know this is, like, so cheap of me\u2026but when can we go back to tipping a normal 20 percent? Is it acceptable that I\u2019ve been doing that for a couple months?! Lol \u2013Whiny WandaIf you\u2019re feeling an icky guilt when tipping 20 percent, something in your brain is acknowledging that the server and the restaurant deserves the extra five (or 15!). They\u2019ve gotta bounce back; the servers have to deal with ornery, unsocialized, impatient, entitled diners, and clearly the federal minimum wage isn\u2019t gonna catch up in this lifetime. How embarrassing was the \u201cdebate\u201d over Chipotle raising its hourly minimum to $15! What\u2019d people worry they\u2019re going to do when they make $20/hour, buy HEALTHCARE?Anyways. Dining in a restaurant is a luxury\u2014no dishes! Seltzer on tap!\u2014so if your budget is too tight to justify tipping a tiny tiny bit more, which is really just making sure someone is paid a liveable wage, maybe stay in tonight.\"Can I impose a (no-sweats) dresscode on the rest of my party or is that insane?\" \u2014Formally FranHa, I love this audacity. I say go for it and call it a \u201ctheme.\u201d In fact, go all out and tell everyone to get dressed up and pretend it\u2019s the pre-Prom dinner where you get your makeup done, put in $80 for a Hummer limo, eat pot brownies in the bathroom for the first time, and spend all dinner trying to remember how to use a fork. FUN!What\u2019s up with the rule of needing to wear a mask on the way to the bathroom, but you can spend hours in a restaurant shouting and yucking it up? Is that really necessary? \u2014Yukky YolandaYeah the wear-a-mask-to-the-bathroom was a charade once we got vaccinated, but there was that small window when some people were and some weren\u2019t yet vaxxed and we were just MAKING SURE. But now, per the CDC*, the only people who need to wear masks to the bathroom in the restaurant, in Costco, and at the Q rallies are the unvaccinated so that they don\u2019t get the new COVID variant and DIE. That\u2019s still what\u2019s at stake here, for them, and yet, not enough people are shouting the word DIE if you ask me. If the restaurant has a mask policy for when you\u2019re away from your table, it doesn\u2019t hurt to wear a mask for 30 seconds. A small inconvenience for steak tartare and seltzer on tap.*The WHO, on the other hand, suggests everyone still wear a mask indoors because of the extra-contagious variant going around. Seems like wearing a mask to the bathroom is playing it safe.Pre-vax, I would pull up my mask whenever a server was near; it just felt like the polite thing to do. Now that I'm vaxxed, I don\u2019t want to mess with that (and I don\u2019t think I need to, like, scientifically), but usually the server is wearing one so I feel like a bit of a jerk not putting on my mask when they\u2019re wearing one. Am I? \u2014Overthinking OllieI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re a jerk, like, at your core. That\u2019s up to other people\u2019s grandmas and strangers on Twitter to decide\u2014the true moral compass of the nation. I\u2019ve experienced both masked and unmasked waitstaff when I\u2019ve gone out because the CDC says if you\u2019re vaccinated, you don\u2019t need to be maskinated. Private businesses can make their own mask guidelines, so check to see if they request wearing masks at the table, or just ask. Ask! Get it out there in the open. If a server\u2019s wearing a mask, that\u2019s to protect them from unwanted germs, COVID or otherwise. Maybe they\u2019re unvaccinated, or just don\u2019t want to catch stupid. There\u2019s a lot of stuff going around, remember croup??Is it acceptable to storm out of a restaurant and not pay for food because of a mask requirement? \u2014Stormy StanleyNever acceptable to not pay for food. That price has a trickle-down effect that directly correlates to peoples\u2019 livelihoods. However, you can be angry at whatever you want, that\u2019s an (often irrational) emotion you\u2019re entitled to as a human being who may or may not need therapy. Is it polite to storm out of any restaurant and cause a scene for something so trivial? Nah. But it is entertaining to me personally to see adults behave like children. You wear pants, too, and remember how hard that was to get used to? But we got there, we got there.I have a bunch of gift cards I bought during the pandemic but haven\u2019t used them yet since my income didn\u2019t change during the pandemic. When is a good time to start using the gift cards? I still feel like restaurants are struggling even though things are opening up. \u2014Stagnant SonyaThis relates to the big tip question. You seem to know the cost of going out to eat, the meal and service, and what that represents: several people\u2019s ability to pay for high deductibles for crappy insurance. So either be willing to pay more than you used to (habits are hard to break, I get it!), or don\u2019t take on this financial burden. Many/most restaurants are still struggling, yep, and they were struggling before the pandemic because it\u2019s an insane industry with really small profit margins BECAUSE they have to keep costs down BECAUSE customers are unwilling to pay more. Wages have been stagnant for decades, so that makes sense too\u2014we don\u2019t have the money to high roll at The Cheesecake Factory the way we want to, but damn are those avocado eggrolls good. We\u2019re in a tough spot, aren\u2019t we? And that ends my summary of the state of the American middle class. Back to the gift cards.If you bought a gift card, use the gift card\u2014that\u2019s what it was for\u2014and remember that the tip is separate and meaningful, so tip on top of the card, and tip well. Then, if you can, come back and back and back to show that restaurant how much you love it.Should I ask if my friends are vaccinated before I go to dinner with them? \u2014Inquisitive IzzyI thought it was LOL when New York Times columnist Ben Smith asked Tucker Carlson if he was vaccinated and he refused to answer because it\u2019s like asking someone when\u2019s the last time they had sex and what position it was in. He was halfway there, though, wasn\u2019t he? If we\u2019re close enough to exchange aerosols, isn\u2019t that like making sure the person you\u2019re about to bang doesn\u2019t have STDs? It\u2019s about protecting both parties. It\u2019s intimate!So yeah, ask your friends before dining indoors together. Because if they\u2019re vaccinated, cool, we\u2019re all comfortable to hang out maskless and share nachos. If they\u2019re not, this could be putting THEM at risk for COVID. The CDC still doesn\u2019t know how likely a vaccinated person is to transmit it to others, but if you\u2019re bringing an unvaccinated friend to an indoor bar with not-so-distant maskless people, they\u2019re at a serious risk if they\u2019re unmasked, too. I\u2019d hang out outdoors in that case.Restaurant service is so bad! Everywhere is understaffed. I tried to be patient last weekend, but I was somewhere for three hours and got two drinks and apps. I paid and left to get dinner elsewhere. What do you do?? \u2014One-Star OmarI experienced this recently. Gorgeous place, wonderful food, laughably bad service (server forgot to bring us plates...then brought two...for four people). Post-pandemic staffing issues are real. A friend of mine can only take bartending shifts when her husband\u2019s home from his job because the cost of childcare is so high she can\u2019t afford to work. There are a ton of valid reasons restaurants are understaffed right now, argue with your uncle about that on your own time.So. In the event that you have bad service, remember that you are merely mortal, and not entitled to being waited on hand and foot every time you dine in a place that spells Grill with an e. You\u2019re capable of empathy and forgiveness. Show these untrained, overworked, underpaid, terrible servers some grace. Tip as you would if the service was great (I know, I know) because people are out here trying to LIVE. And if that sounds hard or challenging for you, maybe explore why that is with anyone other than me lol. The short answer here is: Give \u2018em a break. One day, you might need one, too.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIs It Ever OkayRestaurantsRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
