For cold-weather f\u00eates, all the universal rules of entertaining still apply (prepare as much as you can in advance, always have a well-stocked bar), but there are a few seasonal twists that evoke not just hygge but lykke\u2014nay, ikigai. We asked De Maria chef Camille Becerra and celebrity stylist Kate Young, two women beloved for their entertaining prowess, how to get people to leave the comfort of their homes in the dead of winter and come to their places instead. Here are Becerra and Young\u2019s eight rules to entertain by:Get the number rightWhen it comes to the number of people at your table, Young and Becerra have both found that eight is the sweet spot\u2014large enough to pair off in small groups, small enough to have a single conversation. Becerra finds that her intermittent absences in the kitchen aren\u2019t a problem when there are enough other people around the table. She\u2019s especially fond of inviting people who don\u2019t already know each other. \u201cThey spend time meeting each other,\u201d reasons Becerra. Young and her husband, Keith Abrahamsson, trim the list to six friends when they know they\u2019ll be kids in toe. \u201cThat\u2019s my favorite way to do it,\u201d says the mother of two. \u201cThe kids can play and the adults can also have a good time.\u201dCook food that's close to your heartReward your guests for braving the cold with comforting meals that they might not cook for themselves. When entertaining around the holidays, Becerra drew from her own family background. \u201cLately I\u2019ve been doing a full menu of Puerto Rican food or of Cuban food,\u201d she says. Pastel\u00f3n, the fried sweet plantain and meat dish, is a crowd-pleaser, much like it\u2019s Italian cousin, lasagna. And, in place of eggnog, she serves Coquito, a traditional cocktail of coconut milk, rum, and cinnamon in a bold glass pitcher from Hay. For Young, dipping temperatures call for the hearty ease of slow-cooked meat, like Momofuku\u2019s Bo Ssam, which Young says is a party favorite because the lion\u2019s share of the work is done well before her guests arrive. Lots of sides like kimchi and rice wraps ensures vegetarians and vegans will be spoken for. Just remember to get any dietary restrictions and allergies from your guests before deciding on the menu.Dora Good Ceramics add a layer of texture to any room.\nPhoto courtesy of Dora Ceramics.Forget the holly-printed fine chinaThe days of fine china are long gone, but that doesn\u2019t mean presentation should lack panache. Becerra stocks up on Beau Rush ceramics for de Maria and, when traveling, Dora Alzamora Good ceramics in Mallorca and stoneware from Paris\u2019s Merci La Table Nouvelle collection. \u201cThere are some rectangular pieces that are great for platters,\u201d she suggests. For bowls with real presence, Super Good Thing Platform bowls are impossible to beat. \u201cI think that brand is so awesome,\u201d Becerra says.Bust cold-weather stress with laid-back service\u201cI like things to be more relaxed. I just slap down plates and forks and knives,\u201d She opts for handmade ceramics\u2014but until she creates a full set of her own hand-hewn bowls, cups, and plates, \u201cI have a collection of Russel Wright vintage serving plates.\u201d For the \u201cSwedish country house\u201d aesthetic of her upstate retreat, she collects a mix of modernist mid-century pieces like her vintage Georg Jensen flatware and Friso Kramer table, and rustic details like black and white handwoven napkins and a mix of table runners from Heather Taylor Home. She sometimes creates tablescapes with \u201cclassic wintery stuff\u201d\u2014eucalyptus wreaths, evergreens, amaryllis, and paper whites.Keep it brightTo rev up the hygge, bring in decor that speaks to the time of year. \u201cAlways candles everywhere,\u201d says Becerra, who nixes scented candles in favor of wax that won\u2019t compete with the dinner smells. Young goes with these beeswax taper candles from Etsy, which she displays on an assortment of pewter candlesticks sourced from flea markets. Becerra might also project a film (on mute) on her tall white walls. During the winter months, she loves to screen eighties Christmas comedies, \u201cespecially with Tom Hanks,\u201d she says.But don't go lightWinter is not the time for paring back on menus. Start off with something comforting for guests to sip or nibble on as soon as they come in the door. Young and Becerra both rely on charcuteries to stave off hanger. Hay\u2019s cutting boards make an easy and visually pleasing display, suggests Becerra. And once the show gets rolling, \u201cjust make a menu that has multiple courses and keep bringing food out,\u201d says the chef, who is known to regularly entertain for upwards of four hours with courses that casually blend into subsequent courses. \u201cIt always happens very organically,\u201d she claims.Nail the playlistA good playlist transcends seasonality. Becerra likes to play whatever suits her mood at the moment. \u201cWherever your energy is dictates the rest of the meal,\u201d she says. Whatever she\u2019s feeling while she cooks is what\u2019s playing when her guests come in. This could include anything from Buena Vista Social Club to throwback hip hop like RS-One, Whodini, and Digable Planets. Young defers to her husband, co-owner of record label Mexican Summer, on the playlist. \u201cI really like when he plays Ariel Pink and Connan Mockasin\u2014I think it puts everyone in a good mood.\u201dThe number one rule for merriment is:\u201cBad dinner parties happen,\u201d says Young who admits to occasionally sneaking off to bed early, even while her guests are still present. But no matter how your evening unfolds, Becerra advises, \u201cNever apologize. Julia Child says not to. People are just happy to be with you and have an experience.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishFeel Good Food PlanDinnerPartyPartiesEntertaining + StyleEntertainingRead Morecooking7 Products Getting Us Through the Coldest Winter DaysGallery7 SlidesBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
