Unctuous yet fresh, and such a lovely combination of flavors. I used O white balsamic (lovely stuff), from California, which is not white, true, but it's light enough in color to not darken the pretty, brightly colored peppers as regular balsamic would. Thanks for sharing this delightful recipe.patressaVirginia8/12/2018Dear Chef Hammel I guess the girl with the figs didn't tell you that WHITE balsamic vinegar does not exist in Italia, the type of grape and the process for making aceto balsamico with the changing of the different types of wooden barrels would only result in a very dark vinegar.  I've never seen nor looked for white balsamic vinegar in Italia I also asked some of my colleagues, they agreed with me. The rest of the recipe was good.pacepuleoMilano Italia5/15/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titCondimentBell PepperVegetableHealthyishRoastRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
