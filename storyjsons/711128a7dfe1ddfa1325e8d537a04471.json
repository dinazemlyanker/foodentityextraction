Maybe the word is regret? Embarrassment? Confusion? I had that same sinking, cringy sensation when I returned to a recipe I posted for \u201cmy best granola\u201d six years ago. It calls for sixteen ingredients and half of a ripe banana. Who wants to be stuck with a purposeless half-banana?Maybe I had the time (and the bananas) to spare in 2015, but these days you won\u2019t find me measuring out tablespoons of wheat germ, sesame seeds, flax seeds, and poppyseeds. What you will find me doing is making Andy Baraghani\u2019s Grain-Free Tahini Granola, which requires just seven ingredients (including salt) and can be made from start to finish in about an hour.But it\u2019s not only simple and easy\u2014it\u2019s also some of the best granola I\u2019ve ever tasted, let alone made (and this is coming from someone who eats granola whenever presented the opportunity). Delightfully clumpy and crunchy and not too sweet, it\u2019s proof that granola doesn\u2019t require elaborate song and dance to be delicious. I think the key to its success is the tahini, which brings a nutty savoriness and dries out as it bakes, binding the nuts into huge clusters.Lest you think I\u2019ve changed my ways entirely, I do tweak the recipe a little depending on what I have in my kitchen. Because nuts cost a pretty penny and I\u2019ve got nothing against grains, I usually swap out at least 1 cup for old-fashioned rolled oats. I\u2019ve used shredded coconut instead of coconut flakes (or left it out entirely), subsidized some of it with raw sesame seeds, replaced the tahini with black tahini (natural peanut butter would also be good\u2026!), and traded some of the maple syrup for honey or brown sugar. But no matter how many changes I make, I know I\u2019ll never go back to that 2015 recipe\u2014or that 2015 haircut. (What was I thinking???)Get the recipe:Grain-Free Tahini GranolaIf you\u2019re missing the oats in this gluten-free, make-ahead granola, simply swap out 1 cup of the nuts for \u00be cup rolled oats.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBreakfastGranolaRecipes you want to make.
