Spicy. Savory. Sweet. It\u2019s all that and then some! Peak season melon, not unlike good tomatoes\u2014juicy and tasting of the sun\u2014is a logical supplement. Kimchi, full of sharp aromatics and a mild fizz, prevents the gazpacho from being too sweet. If you\u2019re lucky enough to score some oi (cucumber) kimchi, sub that for the Napa cabbage. Cashews add a silky heft to the gazpacho with none of the stodginess that bread can sometimes bring. Cold mutes flavor, so season the gazpacho before chilling until it has the pucker of a salt and vinegar chip.\u2014Shilpa UskokovicAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.
