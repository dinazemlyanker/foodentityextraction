The bright, fresh topping is a kind of salsa criolla, a Peruvian red onion relish with chile and lime. Arrange the mussels on a platter cup side up for a cocktail snack that\u2019s easy to grab one-handed. At their parties Danielle and Pablo sometimes nestle the mussels into coarse salt, like they\u2019re sitting in sand, to keep the cups upright.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.
