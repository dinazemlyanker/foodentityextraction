Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Hi from Chicago,Where I'm still swooning\u2014and nursing the teensiest hangover\u2014from last night's Superpowered dinner at Mott Street honoring Ashley Novoa and the Chicago Period Project.This dinner felt particularly special because of all the amazing women it brought together. Besides Ashley and chef Bridget Vanaman, of course, there was Ashley's sister-in-law Shelby Allison who happens to be the founder of a super cool platform for women in the beverage industry called Chicago Style. Her team brought in a fun and amazing sommelier, Danielle Norris, to do wine (and sake!) pairings. Homecoming panelists and Chicago ladies-about-town Abena Boamah and Lauren Ash showed up in style. And Tania Cordova, from the Transformative Justice Law Project, spoke movingly about her mission to overturn stringent name-change laws in Illinois, which prevented her from fully transitioning for over 12 years.I probably definitely didn't need that last frozen cocktail at Lost Lake, but I've found that AM runs are the best cures for PM indulgences. I hopped on a bike share and got myself to the Lakefront trail, where I ran a liiiittle further than I meant to. Luckily Cellar Door Provisions was there for me in all my sweat-streaked, red-faced glory. Turns out that roasted apricots with labneh and a couple of masa dumplings in berbere sauce are also good hangover cures.My last stop is Giant later tonight, where I'll be closing out my trip with a a plate of marinated zucchini...and an order of onion rings. Chicago, I like like you.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish editorP.S. Have a healthyish thought, wish, or desire?
