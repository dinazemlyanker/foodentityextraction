Chef Mashama Bailey explains why the cookbook remains so relevant today.By Hilary CadiganMarch 27, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie CraigFacebookTwitterEmailWhen you ask Mashama Bailey who inspires her most as a chef, she doesn\u2019t hesitate. The answer is always Edna Lewis: grand dame of Southern cooking, author of many cookbooks, winner of the inaugural James Beard Living Legend Award. Though Lewis passed away more than a decade ago, Bailey\u2014a boundary-breaker in her own right (catch her on the first episode of this season\u2019s Chef\u2019s Table) and chef-partner at the Grey and the Grey Market in Savannah, Georgia\u2014continues to find inspiration in the cookbooks she left behind. Among them, In Pursuit of Flavor, Lewis\u2019s highly personal celebration of the South\u2019s seasonality. Originally published in 1988, the book reissues today with a forward written by Bailey. We chatted with the Bronx\u2013born chef about why she finds so much inspiration in Lewis\u2019s legacy.Let\u2019s rewind to the moment you first learned about Edna Lewis. How\u2019d it happen?My first assignment of the first semester of culinary school was to write about a chef that inspired me. But this was probably 1999, and outside of Julia Child or the Frugal Gourmet, I didn\u2019t know any chefs. So I was like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll just write about my grandmother because she was probably the best cook I knew: the one that introduced me to food and took me to Zabar\u2019s and Katz\u2019s when we first moved to New York City.\u201dBut my teacher said, \u201cNo, you have to pick an actual chef.\u201d So I started looking for a black woman chef. I couldn\u2019t find one. I couldn\u2019t find any that were in restaurants and had a reputation. All the ones I was finding out about that were alive worked at Disney World, or hotels\u2014these Five Diamond type of things.That world didn\u2019t interest me at all. I didn\u2019t want to wear the big toque on my head and I wasn\u2019t interested in making ice sculptures. I just wanted to cook good food.Why do you think all of the black chefs were siloed at those types of restaurants?Maybe because people weren\u2019t writing about or spending money on [traditionally black food]. Maybe they didn\u2019t feel like an African American point of view was changing the culinary narrative, so they weren\u2019t focusing on it. Maybe it was opportunity. I think a lot of black cooks decided to go into hotels because they had families to raise. So they stayed in the field but went for the benefits, you know? That was my observation.Chef Mashama Bailey at her restaurant, The Grey.\nPhotograph by Chia ChongSo what did you do?I went to the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture up in Harlem, and started digging. It was there that I found out about Edna Lewis.There was an article written about her, in the Washington Post or something, and I was just like, who is this woman? Then I realized what she had done: She was cooking in the \u201940s and \u201950s and all of these communists and writers and actors were really digging her food. And she was cooking the food that she grew up on. Southern food.That was really, really interesting to me because I didn\u2019t see any black chefs cooking Southern food that was getting recognition. They were all cooking French, or German, or Italian. She was cooking food that resonated with her as a child. So I took that, packed it away, and held on to it.And your assignment?I still have a little essay that I wrote about her during that class, but I never really thought about it again. Until, as a chef looking for inspiration, I started unpacking parts of my life. Looking for things that really resonated with me, that had a story and a little bit of a history. I like to cook like that. The food has to mean something to me.Now that I\u2019m cooking down in Georgia, people are always asking me how it is to be me, and how it is to be black, and having all of this recognition. And for me, Edna Lewis is just right there all the time.What about her did you relate to most?That she was a black woman, and that she cooked the food that she wanted to cook, and that she was the child of a former slave. Her family founded Freetown, Virginia. And she kept these traditions and celebrated the different times of the year with her food. We ate like that at home\u2014we didn\u2019t have a farm or anything, but on New Years Day we ate Hoppin\u2019 John and collard greens, and in the summer, fried chicken and barbecue, and in the winter, grains. We ate with the seasons and I really liked that. When I think of a food memory, it really goes to a particular season.Reading through In Pursuit of Flavor, I\u2019m struck by how much of Edna\u2019s food is tied to memories\u2014of her childhood, of her ancestors, of the days when food was purer and vegetables actually tasted like vegetables. What does that mean to you? How do you cook from memory\u2014not just your own but that of your ancestors?Well, when I really started taking food seriously was after my maternal grandmother\u2019s prime. It was just so flavorful. It smelled up the house and was just always\u2026there. I remember how crispy the bacon was, and how long she would fry it. I remember the biscuits and the grits, and how she would make this pasta with ground beef and tomato and onion and cheddar cheese. She would cook it all day, so the pasta was overcooked, cooked into the sauce. That was the way she made spaghetti.It\u2019s funny\u2014a lot of her food growing up I didn\u2019t like, because I wasn\u2019t used to it. Like collard greens. I didn\u2019t start liking collard greens until one day when I was 16 or 17, I went down to her house and she cooked collard greens with pigs\u2019 feet in the pot. And I was like, \u201cHoly crap.\u201d They were gooey and rich and sumptuous, and there was this underlying umami. I didn\u2019t even know that word then, but I had never tasted collard greens like that. From that pot on, I was hooked.Photo by Chelsie CraigDo you use that recipe today, in your restaurants?I don\u2019t put meat in the collard greens we cook, but I put enough olive oil to replicate that feeling, to replicate that texture. I think that\u2019s what it means to cook by memory: There\u2019s a point when you eat something and you are like, that\u2019s it! And then you are forever chasing that feeling. It\u2019s a full body experience.Was it a particular sense of place\u2014the South\u2014that really connected you to both Edna and your grandmother? It seems like you often talk about the two in the same breath.I think initially, yes. Initially it was like, How are we related, what do we have in common? Okay, there\u2019s this southern heritage, there\u2019s this closeness to family, there\u2019s this curiosity. We\u2019re all kind of curious.I think Edna knew from a very young age what her role and her duties in life were. And I think that she went with the skills she had, and was introduced to the right people at the right time, and I have that in common with her. My whole entire career, even when it was hard, every step of the way I had people letting me know that I was doing the right thing. Like I was moving in the right direction, and I was supposed to be where I was.I started cooking late, at 26. I was like, oh man, this sucks, everyone is so much younger than me. And then all of a sudden something happens\u2014I get a raise or a promotion or something like that. Every time I started doubting, I shook it off, put my head down, focused a little bit harder, and something else happened.The way Edna handled her career, and the way she handled success\u2014I really want to emulate that. She was unapologetically herself the entire time.It\u2019s kind of amazing that she was able to do that in the era she lived. Do you have any insight into how she was able to get around all the barriers that existed at the time?There was this person, John Nicholson, who was a friend of Edna\u2019s and her husband\u2019s, and went to her dinner parties, back in the \u201940s and \u201950s (same era as my grandmother). They would put the kids to sleep, and then sit down in the living room and play records and make gin cocktails and eat. In that sort of redcoat environment there were a lot of mixed races in the same building, and this guy who had a little bit of money was like, \u201cHey, I really like your food. Why don\u2019t we open up a restaurant?\u201d So they opened Cafe Nicholson [in 1948]. It was a very simple menu, I don\u2019t even think it was written down: roasted chicken and souffl\u00e9s and a salad, and that was it. People wanted her to make biscuits and do all of this other stuff, and she was like, \u201cNope, this is what I\u2019m doing.\u201dI met Edna\u2019s sister Ruth, who is still alive, a year ago. She was saying how she used to help out in the restaurant and peel shrimp.Photo by Chelsie CraigWhat was that like, meeting Edna\u2019s actual family?Oh, it was awesome. It showed how close and tight-knit they are. But it\u2019s funny: they loved Edna but to them, she was just Edna. In the \u201970s when she wrote her cookbook, they thought that was the height of her success. I don\u2019t think they realized how she was making waves and changing people\u2019s thoughts about black people cooking in this country, or how black people can elevate food in this country. I don\u2019t even think she realized she was doing that. And now that she has passed on, there\u2019s a stamp in her honor, a foundation in her honor. I think they\u2019re kind of like, Holy crap, she was really important.Do you have a favorite recipe in the book? Anything that really resonated with you?Oh shit, probably one of her quail dishes. The quail with the grapes [Pan-fried Quail with Country Ham, pg. 101]. I always love cooking her quail dishes.What about ingredients? Any she introduced you to?Watercress. She loved watercress, and I try to use it every chance I get. A lot of chefs use arugula, but I think that watercress is very east coast, very American.What about cooking methods?When she makes her pie crust, she doesn\u2019t let it get cold again; she makes it all the way through. And she doesn\u2019t pre-bake the bottom, which allows the sauce from the fruit to soak into the crust. I had always been taught to blind bake the crust, but she doesn\u2019t do that. Like with peach cobbler\u2014when I blind baked the crust it didn\u2019t come out as an old fashioned peach cobbler. So I\u2019ll never do that again.What does it mean to you that this book is being reissued at this particular moment? Is there a message you take from it now that you didn\u2019t before?Stay close to home, and don\u2019t forget about the things your parents and your grandparents instilled in you. All of that stuff really, truly matters.I think as we grow older, we get to this phase in our lives where we\u2019re trying to find ourselves, and when that happens we tend to forget about all the things that were put into us by our family. For me, Pursuit of Flavor is really about coming home, and remembering where you come from. It\u2019s about not forgetting that every season has a reason and everything comes full circle.Buy it: The reissue of Edna Lewis\u2019 In Pursuit of Flavor (with foreword by Mashama Bailey) is $20 on Amazon.All products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
