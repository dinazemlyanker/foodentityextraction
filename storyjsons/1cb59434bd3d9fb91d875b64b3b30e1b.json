He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.When you\u2019re an editor in chief, the truth is, you\u2019re not totally on top of every little thing that goes on at your brand. So when Bon App\u2019s social media team of Rachel Karten and Emily Schultz launched our Chefs at Home series on Instagram, I saw the first episode the same time our 4 million followers did.And, just like them, I was hooked.Cramped galley kitchens, microwaves installed over tiny four-burner ranges, rice makers stowed on crowded counters. Hey, big-shot professional chefs\u2014they\u2019re just like us!Over the past two months, Karten and Schultz have reached out to everyone from Parnass Savang at Atlanta\u2019s Talat Kitchen to Nina Compton of New Orleans\u2019 Bywater American Bistro. And they have graciously invited us into their homes to show us how they cook for themselves\u2014step by helpful step\u2014when they\u2019re unable to operate their restaurants.Each episode, I walk away not only starving, but feeling like I have a new home cook\u2013friendly dish I\u2019m itching to add to my arsenal.Take the charming, playful Savang, who demo\u2019d khai jiao, a Thai omelet. After beating two eggs and adding to them chopped scallions and crisped-up pork-belly (I think I\u2019ll just be going with basic bacon), he pours the mixture into a skillet of smoking hot oil. The egg instantly inflates into a puffy, crispy, custardy pillow. Magic. On to a bed of steamed jasmine rice it goes. Hello, dinner.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Parnass Savang\u2019s khai jiao!!!\nPhoto by Parnass SavangCompton, meanwhile, confidently commands a chocolate-brown roux before piling in andouille sausage and fresh crawfish. I can almost smell it through the screen. And it reminds me that when this whole crisis finally subsidies, I need to get back to New Orleans, America\u2019s most unique food city, and Compton\u2019s Bywater Bistro.Rounding out the weekly series is the exuberant Yia Vang from Union Hmong Kitchen, teaching us how to make the grilled tri-tip with tiger bite sauce from our June Grilling Issue cover. Ashleigh Shanti, of Asheville\u2019s Benne on Eagle, greets us in her favorite cozy robe with a big mug of coffee, while making glossy, syrupy strawberry compote for a stack of cornmeal pancakes.Oh, and I can\u2019t forget Lucas Sin of Junzi Kitchen, who absolutely schools us on the art of fried-rice making with his golden rice technique. He coats each grain with egg yolk before adding it to a shimmering hot pan. Just when you think you know what you\u2019re doing, a technique like this comes along and resets your dials. (Recipe coming online, soon!)Like everyone, my inbox and Instagram feed overflows each day with lord knows what. But each week I eagerly await the newest Chefs at Home installment, because just like you, I have no idea who\u2019s up next.Explore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterRead MorecookingThere's No Better Time to\u2026 Add Brown Butter to Your OatmealBy Alex BeggsLifestyleMy Pantry Spreadsheet Is Bringing Me So Much Joy Right NowBy Christina Chaeyculture32 Highly Achievable, Totallllllllllly Normal Quarantine Cooking ProjectsBy Alex BeggscultureWhere To Order Meat OnlineBy MacKenzie Chung FeganRecipes you want to make.
