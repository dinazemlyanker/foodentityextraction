There's the \"Hermes of marijuana\" and the \"Barneys of weed,\", but when it comes to getting a high-end high, Lord Jones is the gold standard.The L.A.-based CBD company has been busy infusing single-origin Ecuadorian dark chocolate and sea salt caramels with CBD since 2016. Into the Gloss loves their CBD-infused body lotion. Allure loves their espresso chews. And when it came to picking a product to represent the burgeoning CBD food industry, Bon Appetit featured their classic gumdrops in our August issue.Each gumdrop contains 20 mg of CBD, which is on the higher end of most CBD products we've seen. They\u2019re made from just five ingredients: gelatin, \u201cnatural European fruit essences,\u201dcitric acid, sugar, and full-spectrum, phytocannabinoid-rich CBD. (Full-spectrum means the extract contains all the other cannabinoids found in the marijuana plant like CBN and CBG, but it\u2019s still non-psychoactive). There are no artificial colors or flavors. And, yes, they\u2019re gluten free.We're going to be straight with you: This is an expensive box of gumdrops. And at $5 a pop, it\u2019s pretty steep for CBD standards too.Now, don't these gumdrops look pretty?\nPhoto by Emma FishmanBehind the Game of Thrones-esque seal and underneath the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory gold foil lie nine portly gumdrops. They are deep purple and Creamsicle orange. Laid in a Rubix cube pattern, they alternate in color like a group of synchronized swimmers gunning for gold. It\u2019s very pretty, and plucking a single gumdrop from the jewel-box packaging certainly feels indulgent.The gumdrops are billed as \u201cold fashioned,\u201d as though sugar fiends in the 1900s were imbibing CBD between rounds of Parcheesi. They're appropriately squishy and plump, with a nice dusting of sugar around the outside. The smooth interior holds its shape, so you can save half for later or take the time to examine your bite marks. They taste vaguely of tropical fruit (\u201cnatural European fruit essences,\u201d to be precise), with an herbal whisper of CBD at the finish.Please note: This is not the kind of CBD product that leaves you guessing about whether you\u2019re feeling something. (As a rule, if you have to ask, the answer is no.) On the other hand, you won\u2019t be getting high. The results are pleasantly mellow: a quiet sense of calm that feels like curling up in the sun.All of Lord Jones CBD products ship nationwide except to Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and West Virginia. (Sorry guys.) Should you be looking to take your gumdrop experience to the next level, check out their limited edition collab with the Icelandic avant-rock band Sigur Ros. It features \u201cthe flavors of foraged Icelandic berries\u201d (wild blackberries, strawberries, and blueberries), and would pair beautifully with the etherial falsetto of Sigur Ros frontman J\u00f3nsi. Yes, it\u2019s an over-the-top, bougie-by-way-of-Brooklyn fantasy. But if you\u2019re going to give the gift of high-status chill-inducing confectionary, you might as well go all the way.Before you buy, consider consulting a medical practitioner and checking cannabis laws in your area. And remember: Everyone\u2019s experience is unique.
