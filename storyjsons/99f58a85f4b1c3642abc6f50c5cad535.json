And it\u2019s all dressed in a lemony, garlicky spiced oil that we\u2019d encourage you to drizzle over ricotta or hummus. Be sure to use black or French green lentils. Brown or red lentils will get too soft\u2014you\u2019ll end up with a stew rather than a salad.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Stack leaves, then roll into fat cigars. Slice crosswise into \u00bc\" strips to long, thin ribbons. Unfurl ribbons and run your knife through them just once or twice more to shorten any very long strips. Transfer to a large bowl, season with salt, and massage until kale is silkier, softer, and darker in color, 1\u20132 minutes.Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 2Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil over high heat. While you're waiting, prep the spiced oil. Coarsely chop \u00bd cup raw almonds; set aside. Trim 3 scallions and separate white and green parts (save the green parts for later in the recipe); thinly slice white parts and transfer to a small skillet. Smash and peel 4 garlic cloves. Add those to same skillet, too. Using a vegetable peeler or paring knife, remove three 3\" strips of lemon peel (avoiding white pith); reserve rest of the lemon for your salad dressing. Add peels to skillet. Pour \u00bd cup extra-virgin olive oil into skillet and stir so that all of the elements are coated in oil.Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 3Add 1\u00bd cups black beluga or French green lentils to now-boiling water, reduce heat to medium, and simmer, uncovered, until lentils are tender but still al dente, 20\u201325 minutes (they'll turn mushy if overcooked). We love to cook lentils like pasta\u2014that is, in an abundant amount of salted water\u2014so that we can monitor their doneness as they cook and make sure they don't get too soft.Step 4While lentils cook, heat skillet with scallion mixture over medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until garlic starts to brown and lemon peel starts to curl, about 3 minutes. Add almonds and cook, stirring frequently, until almonds are browned, about 3 more minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1 Tbsp. cumin seeds and \u00bd tsp. crushed red pepper flakes\u2014the residual heat from the oil will bloom those spices and bring out their flavors.Step 5Strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl, shaking to help oil drain; reserve oil (that's the base of your salad dressing). Spread almond mixture (don't forget those cumin seeds!) on a paper towel-lined plate or baking sheet. Season with salt and let cool (the nuts will get crunchier as they sit).Step 6Crumble 5 oz. feta into bowl with kale. Smash 1 cup Castelvetrano olives with the back of your knife; remove pits. Tear olives into large pieces and add to bowl. Thinly slice reserved scallion greens and add most to bowl (save some for serving). Add juice of reserved lemon and \u00bd tsp. salt.Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 7Drain lentils well, shaking to get rid of excess moisture, and add to bowl with kale; season with salt. Add infused oil and half of nuts and toss to combine.Step 8Divide salad among bowls. Garnish with remaining nuts and scallion greens. (If you\u2019re taking this to work, just throw all of the scallions and nuts in at once\u2014or bring them to work in separate containers and be that person garnishing your desk salad. You're worth it.) Eat around the lemon peels and garlic slices, which are edible but intense.How would you rate Just-Keeps-Getting-Better Lentil Salad ?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (139)Back to TopTriangleI could eat this salad every day! I appreciated the technique in this recipe and it turned out lovely, with such a great balance of flavors. I might add some golden raisins next time for h a bit of sweetness, but truly, this salad is fine on its own!AnonymousMinneapolis 2/19/2022The only reason this didn\u2019t get 5 stars is because the instructions are so poorly done. IT would not print on my iPad without photos and running to 8 pages. Instructions for various pieces were mixed in the same step. I had to keep scrolling through steps past pictures to understand what to do next, and then going back to find the next step on an ingredient. Put the basic prep of the ingredient in the list: e.g., raw almonds, coarsely chopped; 3 - 3\u201d strips of lemon peel and  the juice of one lemon. \nFollowing the comments of others, I cut the salt and olive oil and added dill. I would suggest keeping with 1/2 cup olive oil if you will save the salad for later meals. The dressing soaked into the lentils and kale and the salad was rather dry after the first serving.Cindy WDenver, CO2/19/2022I felt I had to cut the amounts of oil, feta, almonds and olives (and salt!) to make it more diet friendly but it was delicious . The cumin seeds and almonds make the recipe-  so flavorful with a nice crunch.  My only complaint is the recipe format. What\u2019s with the micromanaging of the steps? Very annoying to have to look back and forth to find my place within the different elements of the recipe.  It would be much more user friendly to list the steps for each part -  kale massage, lentil cooking, spicy oil. Some of  the steps could have been eliminated (or at least less confusing) by incorporating them into the ingredients list. For example: chopped almonds or peeled garlic,. You know\u2026like a normal recipe.MmmarigoNorthern NJ2/4/2022My husband who professes to lentil and kale avoidance loves this salad, as do I.  I\u2019m ordering whole cumin seeds so I can make it as written next time.\nRicepadyArizona2/1/2022Good lunch recipe to take to work. Will last a week. I used kalamata olives instead of the Castelvetrano because it was easier to find. Cut down on the salt a lot -- feta and kalamata olives provided enough salt taste. Per other reviewers' suggestions and experiences, I cut down on the oil and used 1/3 cup, added the feta when the mixture had cooled, cut up the garlic cloves and added it back to the lentils, and took out the crispy lemon peels to eat on the side. I also used 3/4 cup of almonds because I like the crunch factor. Delicious and filling. AnonymousHonolulu, HI1/19/2022This salad is easy and great, but I hate how expensive it is. Castelvetrano olives, feta, AND almonds!? Can't catch a break.AnonymousPortland, OR1/13/2022This was good but after heavily seasoning the lentil water and lightly seasoning the kale and nut mixture, def did not need any more additional salt. MJTexas12/8/2021Yum!! Heavy on the citrusy flavors but it works. I added dill per the suggestion of one user and I agree, herbs make it taste even better! I also added in some chopped raisins for a little sweetness to contrast the salty savoriness. Also subbed lacinto for reg. kale (store was out :( ) and I even used brown lentils but made sure they were cooked al dente and not mush. AnonymousHouston, TX12/8/2021This was a great hearty, cold weather salad. Nice mix of textures. I needed to punch up the flavor somewhat, so I tossed with ACV and maple syrup and added fresh dill. Herbs really helped. CJSan Diego, CA12/1/2021fantastic salad - love this recipe!  Will def be making this again and again !mmLos Angeles, CA11/27/2021Is there nutrition information on this somewhere?Jaye WhitneyDenton, TX11/9/2021So fresh and delicious. My kids love it! Definitely making this on Sunday afternoons for lunches for the busy week ahead! JS Ohio10/28/2021love it\nHave made it four times.  The last time I made it I forgot to put the oil in.  Turned out this was a good idea since we were using it the next day.  So we served the salad on a salted fresh heirloom tomato slice and drizzled oil over.  Delicious!  Thank you !ESB10/19/2021I was hesitant to make this because I had to substitute so many ingredients.   However, this is an amazing recipe and adapts well to substitutions.  My local grocery did not have Castelvetrano olives, Tuscan kale, and no dry lentils of any variety (rural living: the struggle is real).  I had to substitute canned, drained lentils, regular pimento-stuffed olives, and a bag of chopped kale.  The flavors didn't care:  they thrived and ascended above the sum of their ingredients.  The spiced oil and crunchy topping are awesome!  I left out the cheese because it wasn't available and we don't really like it, but we didn't notice the omission.  If it is this good with inferior ingredients, I am willing to bet it is outstanding when made as written.  A definite keeper! Thanks for sharing the recipe!LCTennessee10/15/2021I don\u2019t generally leave reviews but I\u2019ve made this so many times now that I feel guilty not leaving one.  Delicious, complex, hearty salad.   Worth the effort (it gets faster once you\u2019ve made it 10x).  The only thing that I tweaked after making it exactly per the recipe is that I now make it with like 1/3 cup olive oil and I reduce the feta by about an ounce to cut down the calories a little.   Most of the time I leave the garlic and lemon peel in the topping because it tastes good.
