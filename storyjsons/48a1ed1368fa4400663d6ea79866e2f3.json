You\u2019re bringing scene-stealing cookies.By Carla Lalli MusicNovember 15, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, Styling by Sue LiFacebookTwitterEmailEvery Wednesday night, Bon App\u00e9tit food director Carla Lalli Music takes over our newsletter with a sleeper-hit recipe from the Test Kitchen vault. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Why make pie when you can have cookies?Judging by the listener questions about Thanksgiving that we got on this week\u2019s holiday special Foodcast, those of us who aren\u2019t hosting this year are actively trying to figure out how to upstage the person who is. Reverse Holiday Hosting Revenge Mania, if I had to put a low-key psychological diagnosis on it. And no, you can\u2019t bring an \u201cextra\u201d turkey, or a pie that no one asked you to bring, or a different recipe for mashed potatoes because you don\u2019t approve of your aunt\u2019s mash.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!You can, however, bring a cookie\u2014a non-threatening offering that may give you the final word. Ideally, this cookie will be chocolate, since no one thinks about chocolate at Thanksgiving, thereby handing you an available-flavor opportunity with no foreseeable competition. A box of cookies presented to the hostess could even be construed as a \u201cfor you to enjoy anytime\u201d offering, but if she\u2019s gracious, she\u2019ll of course put them out on the dessert buffet. That was so sweet of you, Dear Reader, to bring cookies, look at how cute they are.Dinner unfolds as your plans coalesce. You and your chocolate sabl\u00e9s are hunters; like big cats, you wait to pounce. By holding off until dessert to make your move, you avoid all the noise. Shouldering in on the main part of dinner would leave you exposed\u2014the stakes are too high, the field too crowded, the dishes too entrenched! (You didn\u2019t really want to be one of three stuffings in an elimination heat, did you?)Eventually, it will be pie time. Pumpkin, surely. An apple thing (like this new naked apple tart). A caramel-and-nut tart. Lemon meringue. And then the hostess will remember your cute little cookies.Our new naked apple tart is also a good party option.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensNow is your time. If everything goes as planned, a plate with your cookies will be passed around, choices will be made. Trust me, there\u2019s something about the excess of four pie slices on a person\u2019s six-inch dessert plate that will make an innocent-looking cookie seem utterly attainable. \u201cOh, they\u2019re nothing,\u201d you say, when someone asks what you brought. \u201cJust some simple chocolate slice-and-bakes.\u201d Pause.\u201cCool recipe, actually. They\u2019re made with date sugar.\u201dSorry, was that the sound of the needle coming off the record? Did all conversation just come to a halt? Quiet enough to hear a fork drop! You\u2019ll now have everyone\u2019s attention as you confess that it is indeed possible to make a dessert with dehydrated pulverized dates instead of white cane sugar.\u201cSo...these are good for me,\u201d your brother\u2019s new girlfriend will say in disbelief. Oh, are they.\u201cWhy are they so tender?\u201d your uncle\u2019s business partner will ask. That\u2019s from creaming the sugar until it\u2019s very light and fluffy, plus there\u2019s barely enough flour to hold them together.\u201cWhat\u2019s the salty stuff on top?\u201d your niece wants to know. Crunchy seeds and flaky salt, you say, to balance out the rich chocolate.\u201cWhy does it seem like they\u2019re melting?\u201d your dad asks. That\u2019s the grated chocolate holding them together\u2014the cookie is actually melting.I\u2019m just saying: everyone has had pie before. It\u2019s great, it\u2019s familiar, it has to be there. But not-too-sweet chocolate cookies with salted crunchy toppers? The healthyish sabl\u00e9 may not have been on the original invite list, but this year, they\u2019re the chic, understated friend-of-a-friend who snags a seat and then quietly slays with brutally witty insights all night long. There are some dishes, and people, that you only need to see at the holidays. This cookie is more than welcome to show up at dinner parties all year long.Get the recipe:Chocolate Sabl\u00e9s with Date SugarExplore Bon App\u00e9titCookieCarla NewsletterRecipes you want to make.
