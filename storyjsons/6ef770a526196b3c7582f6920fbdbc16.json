Such as the Perfect Bar.In fourth grade, I made a giant 3D replica of my favorite candy: Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups. I can\u2019t remember the point of the assignment, but I\u2019ll never forget bursting through the classroom door with my huge Styrofoam and poster board creation. Back then, I believed no more perfect marriage of peanut butter and chocolate existed than Reese\u2019s.Today, I realize something even better exists. The Perfect Bar\u2019s name carries not one single shred of irony. The refrigerated bar comes in 12 flavors (some seasonal), but I only need one: Dark Chocolate Chip Peanut Butter with Sea Salt. The peanut butter is smooth and creamy, the texture that of thick cookie dough. Tiny chocolate chip clusters cling to the surface. Although the bars keep at room temperature for three days, I like them chilled. Lately, I\u2019ve added them to my morning routine: I get up at 5 a.m. I make coffee, fill my water bottle, and grab a bar from the fridge. Even without eating anything else for breakfast, I\u2019m full and happy for hours, thanks to 15 grams of protein.Each bar also contains 20 superfoods, but who cares when they\u2019re so mind-bendingly delicious. The bars are healthy, but that can be your little secret if you want. Not only are they certified organic, Non-GMO Project Verified, gluten-free, and kosher, but they also contain a powdered blend of, ahem: flaxseed, rose hip, tomato, alfalfa, celery, kelp, dulse, carrot, orange, apple, and spinach. It\u2019s vitamin- and mineral-dense and, amazingly, all these veggies are tasteless. So when you buy the bar, just deduct it from your vegetable budget.So how can the bar taste better than a Reese\u2019s while featuring vegetables? Leigh Keith, the cofounder and co-CEO of Perfect Snacks, explained to me that her dad, Bud Keith, a health-conscious hippie, perfected this recipe when he, his wife, and their first six children lived in a motorhome (and later, a bus). Among the family secrets to perfect texture: freshly ground nut butter. \u201cIf you try to use premade peanut butter that\u2019s been sitting in a drum for months and months, it\u2019s just not the same,\u201d Leigh says. The protein comes from egg and milk rather than whey, and honey provides just the right sweetness.Starting at age 10, Leigh made and sold bars to friends using her dad\u2019s recipe. When Bud\u2019s health deteriorated, Leigh, then 19, and her brother Bill, committed to providing for their family. The plan? Get serious about making and selling Perfect Bars. Their company launched in 2005, and for years, before they partnered with Mondel\u0113z International in 2019, their production line consisted of family members, rolling pins, and a KitchenAid mixer. \u201cWe leveraged our life savings to buy a candy wrapper machine off of eBay,\u201d Leigh says. Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Perfect Bars may not be candy, but I wonder what my 10-year-old self, schlepping her giant cardboard Reese\u2019s to class, would have said if I told her one day, she\u2019d love a protein bar even more. She probably would have called my bluff, but she would have been so very, very wrong.Dark Chocolate Chip Peanut Butter Perfect Bar$3 at Target$20 at Amazon (10-pack)Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make.
