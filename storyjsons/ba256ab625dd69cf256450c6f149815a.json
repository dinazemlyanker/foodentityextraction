Waiting until the hype has waned is my move, which explains why I am currently cruising through Mad Men on Netflix.But with trendy CBD\u2014the non-psychoactive cannabis compound found in both cannabis and hemp plants that the New York Times recently called \u201cthe new avocado toast\u201d\u2014I\u2019m more than adjacent; I\u2019m a straight-up evangelist. And my latest CBD discovery is Recess.Launched in October, Recess is a La Croix-esque sparkling-water drink infused with CBD and adaptogens (herbs that help your body adapt to stress). While there are other CBD-infused drinks on the market, like Dirty Lemon\u2019s +cbd, sprig, and Kickback CBD Cold Brew, Recess is the only one made with both adaptogens and the millennial Kool-Aid that is sparkling water.When I first heard about this drink,  it sounded a little too Peak 2018 for my liking: La Croix vibes, CBD, and adaptogens?! Even for a CBD obsessive, it was a bit much. But then I tried a can, and I was hooked..A can of Recess\u2014which contains 10 mg of cannabidiol from full-spectrum hemp extract\u2014simultaneously relaxes my body and gives me this low-key productivity buzz. I\u2019m able to peacefully get my work done without checking Instagram every two seconds or taking a Very Important quiz to find out what my Zodiac sign reveals about what type of sandwich I am. And Recess\u2019s founder, Benjamin Witte, says that\u2019s no accident. For starters, using full-spectrum hemp extract as opposed to CBD isolate (the other option) means that the extract also has other cannabinoids found in the hemp plant, which some research has shown may help create a more potent product. He also sources the CBD from a high-quality farm in Colorado, where the hemp is grown under strict guidelines using only 100% organic farming practices. I love their slogan, too\u2014\u201cnot tired, not wired\u201d\u2014because that\u2019s legit how I feel when I drink a can.But, for me, Recess\u2019 biggest draw is that, unlike other CBD products, there isn\u2019t any sort of ick factor involved to get the benefits. When I take CBD oil pills, I end up burping up little tastes of weed throughout the day. And when I get a CBD latte from the place on my corner, the hemp oil also comes on a little too strong and then chills on my tongue, like when someone stares at you for just one second too long.With Recess, you don\u2019t have to put anything under your tongue, you don\u2019t have to worry about ~the linger,~ and let\u2019s not forget, it\u2019s water, so you\u2019re also doing double duty by hydrating. It comes in three flavors\u2014blackberry chai, peach ginger, and pomegranate citrus\u2014along with concentrated juice and organic ginger to help mask the CBD taste. My favorite flavor is blackberry chai, because it reminds me of the chai that my fiance, who grew up in New Delhi, introduced me to on our first trip there.Because they\u2019re so drinkable, I end up casually sipping on a can all day long, which sets me up to chill in my concentration cocoon throughout the day. And then, before I know it, I have magically conquered my to-do list, and it\u2019s already time to chill in my other go-to cocoon: the pile of blankets on my couch.Buy it: $30 for a six-can variety pack; $39.99 for an eight-can pack of one flavor; $4.99 per canAll products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
