So I barged in to tell him something very important. \u201cI love these crackers!\u201d I announced, because I definitely couldn\u2019t wait until he didn\u2019t have shaving cream all over his face.Cheese crackers are a year-round food for me: Cheez-Its are my official airplane snack and I buy Goldfish from the Rite Aid by my apartment on the regular. But for the holidays, you want some special. Something homemade even. Something a bit more sophisticated, maybe? So if you\u2019re hosting a holiday party this year and your eggnog is too sweet, your cookies are overbaked, or the ham a bit dry, as long as you have a giant pile of these cheese crackers, it\u2019s all going to be okay. Plus, they\u2019re way easier to make than attempting a beautiful royal icing pattern on said cookies.Don\u2019t expect a super crispy cracker; instead, these have a bit of pleasant chewiness that we attribute to the fact that there is a lot of cheese involved.
