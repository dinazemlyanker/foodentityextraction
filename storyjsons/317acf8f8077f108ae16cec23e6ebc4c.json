I learned to recognize the smell of these sizzling barbecued beef skewers, a traditional Khmer food, during a visit to Cambodia more than a decade ago (sach ko translates to \u201cbeef\u201d and ang to \u201cbarbecue\u201d). It became a mission to seek it out wherever I traveled there, sampling its many variations in a country not widely recognized for its incredible cuisine.\u00a0At the heart of the dish is kroeung (\u1782\u17d2\u179a\u17bf\u1784), one of five signature spice pastes used in Khmer cookery. Galangal, lemongrass, and makrut lime leaves form the aromatic flavor base of each kroeung, which branches into different styles depending on what else is added. Sach ko ang uses yellow kroeung, owed to the fresh turmeric that gives it its golden hue.\u00a0You\u2019ll most commonly find sach ko ang at bustling street food stalls where vendors grill them upon clay braziers (charcoal burners). Passersby can purchase a single skewer or two to be eaten on the go as an afternoon snack, but at lunchtime they\u2019re eaten as a complete meal with a side of sweet crunchy green papaya and carrot pickle (chruak l\u2019hong or \u1787\u17d2\u179a\u1780\u17cb\u179b\u17d2\u17a0\u17bb\u1784), served inside a crusty baguette or with steamed rice. In addition to the kroeung marinade, the beef is seasoned with oyster sauce and palm sugar along with a multitude of added variations ranging from toasted ground star anise, MSG, chili paste, or fish sauce. My version is inspired by a recipe taught to me by Pek Sarann, a Khmer cook from Phnom Penh and owner of Bok it Ihe (\u1794\u17bb\u1780\u17a5\u178f\u179b\u17d2\u17a0\u17c2) restaurant in Koh Kong, who learned the recipe from her mother. While other Khmer cooks prefer a longer marinade for more developed flavors, Sarann cooks her skewers after a short 30-minute marinade, amplifying the freshness of the ingredients in the kroeung.\u00a0When preparing kroeung, it\u2019s best to wear gloves, as fresh turmeric stains fingers. The quick-pickle is ready to eat after just 30 minutes. To make a more substantial meal, add steamed rice or serve inside a buttered baguette with the pickle, and drink with an ice-cold beer, just as the Khmer people do. \u2014Lara LeeAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

If chilling, let beef sit out at room temperature 1 hour before grilling.Step 4Prepare a grill for medium-high heat; oil grate. Thread beef onto skewers. (Alternatively, you can cook these in a cast-iron skillet lightly coated with oil.) Grill, turning about every minute or so, until browned and lightly charred in spots, 6\u20138 minutes for medium, or done to your liking. (The beef should be firm to the touch with a little bounce when pressed and slightly pink in the center.)Step 5Transfer skewers to plates and very lightly season with salt. Drain pickles and serve on the side.How would you rate Sach Ko Ang?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (4)Back to TopTriangleIncredible. So much flavor. I used lime zest and ground turmeric and it turned out great. The pickled veggies are a perfectly refreshing complement to the meat. The ribeye melts in your mouth, but I'd also be interested in trying out different cuts. Definitely a keeper! DanaSacramento, CA7/14/2021This is one of the most delicious recipes I\u2019ve made in a LONG time! Yes, the ingredients list fails to list turmeric but just throw some in and don\u2019t let that deter you. I think I said \u201coh my god\u201d at least 5 times while eating. The marinade is incredible by itself but I think the use of ribeye really sends this recipe into another dimension. We ate it over rice and tried leftovers in a baguette - both amazing! Cannot wait to make this again.DanielleChicago6/26/2021This was delicious!  I served the pickles and meat on a warm, buttered, crunchy roll.  The sirloin was so tender and flavorful. The sweet quick pickles nicely balancing it out.  I like that I can do it on short notice or prep ahead of time.  Definitely will make again.\n\nNotes:\nI didn't find galangal at the store and used fresh ginger. \nAlso added 1 tsp. turmeric based on looking at other recipes, as it seemed to be an important ingredient though not listed on the ingredients.  Jodi (again)CA6/23/2021The recipe preparation steps and the summary both mention turmeric yet there is no turmeric in the ingredients list.
