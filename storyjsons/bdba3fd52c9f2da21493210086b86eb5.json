Couldn\u2019t be easier and very flavorful! Did not salt chicken based on reviews, but next time would also cut the soy sauce a bit as it was still a tad too salty. Delicious, though! AnonymousColumbus, OH1/21/2022This takes 20 minutes to make and it RULESAnonymous9/28/2021So salty!!! I followed the recipe, but it turned out as an absolute salt bomb. Fish sauce and the added salt was wayyyy too much.  Adding fresh carrots and cucumbers couldn\u2019t save it...\n\nDon\u2019t add any additional salt and maybe cut the fish sauce by half? \n\nNo way this should have the rating it does?!\n\n\nJason Boston, Ma5/28/2021Sooo tasty and quick to make! I didn't have ground chicken so I diced a chicken breast and it worked perfectly. I also only used a teaspoon of sugar. Definitely going to make again MarthaDublin, Ireland4/27/2021Surprised by how good this was. Truly low effort HIGH reward. I added some canned baby corn to mine which was MWAAH!  Have some celtuce I picked up at the Chinese grocery that I'm stoked to add to tonight's version. Might also add an egg, some nuts... Probably would make an awesome spring roll filling. So many possibilities to keep this meal \"new\" week-to-week :O AnonymousNew York4/25/2021Has become a regular meal on our list of favorites.Randy CanadaCanton GA3/8/2021This is a household favorite and I finally decided to show some love with a review -- this recipe is the PERFECT meal for literally any night. It's highly customizable, easy, quick, delicious, and flavorful. Chaey is a hero <333AnonymousChicago, IL3/4/2021Wayyy too salty even after being cut with the lime juice. Recipes also needs Hoisin sauce or something. AnonymousChicago, IL2/9/2021This recipe has become a beloved regular in my home. I\u2019ve made it as-is, I\u2019ve deconstructed it and turned it into a rice bowl topped with lettuce and herbs, I\u2019ve made it with several different proteins, and I\u2019ve even taken the absolutely-to-die-for sauce and added it to different Asian inspired dishes. My dinner tonight just might be this sauce on some noodles and shrimp. It truly is a delicious recipe.Nicole KCT11/17/2020I love this! I've made it many times, but recently I've started adding a punnet of diced shiitakes and some grated carrot for more veggies. We usually have this with rice and some sliced cucumber, cherry tomatoes, and the dark green parts of the scallions on top. (If adding mushrooms and extra veg it will need more seasonings.) Quick, delicious, and versatile. Next time I'll try it with tofu instead.AnonymousMontr\u00e9al8/16/2020Super easy and really tasty. The given recipe is a great base but as others have suggested, you definitely want to double the sauce as well as add other veggies to lighten it up. I did shredded carrots, but onions and mushrooms would be delicious too. I also added some toasted sesame oil and ginger. AnonymousSan Mateo, CA6/15/2020Most excellent, easy dish! I like to saut\u00e9 thinly sliced cabbage with the scallions and garlic. Lightens the dish, adds more vegetable, and for those caring about frugality, makes a little pork/chicken go a long way! Like others said, double sauce (but not the sugar).\n\nDeborahNYCNYC5/12/2020Made this for dinner tonight and LOVED IT! Pretty easy and super delicious. Love the spicy chicken, almost like an easier version of Thai larb gai. Definitely serve as recommended with extra sambal and I added some sambal cashews for a little extra crunch. adamleclairOsaka, Japan 5/9/2020I cannot tell you how delicious this recipe is; or how often I make it. I often double the scallions, and will sometimes add finely diced mushrooms when I add the ground chicken to extend the recipe. Tonight I\u2019m going to try adding a little msg! I usually serve this with lime wedges and fresh torn herbs over rice, but it\u2019s also good tossed in noodles (I know it\u2019s not authentic but I had soba noodles on hand), although I try to make it a little saucier with the noodles. STL5/4/2020I added a lot of finely chopped mushrooms and water chestnuts, so had to nearly double the sauce. I think the add-ins made it! Will be making again.
