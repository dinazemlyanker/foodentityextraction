The cookies are good though.By Alex BeggsDecember 21, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie CraigFacebookTwitterEmailIt\u2019s finally here\u2014the end of the year! My quest to try everything new at Trader Joe\u2019s was long, caloric, adventurous, fun, and hopefully semi-useful. (Here\u2019s Part I, where it all began.) It was also frustrating. I went to Trader Joe\u2019s once, sometimes twice a week, and you know what I never found? THE APPLE CIDER DONUTS. For whatever reason, there was always a lag of new stock at many New York locations, and thus, I\u2019ll sadly be unable to review the new mini stroopwafel ice cream sandwiches today. Those look awesome. I tried three stores! The highlights of the year were definitely the zhoug sauce, pepita salsa, and cauliflower latkes. I saw a couple picking up flowers on their way to get married on one trip, and heard customers singing in the aisles on multiple occasions. Every cashier I ever encountered was kind, and psyched about at least one thing I was buying. Once I called a store to see if they had a new ice cream, and someone picked up\u2014a HUMAN\u2014on the FIRST RING. You can\u2019t say that for many stores. Things I always bought when I was shopping for BA: multiple $1.49 avocados, flour tortillas, and various cheeses. My great aunt started putting in special requests for these quinoa chips she likes, and backup jars of cowboy caviar. Everyone has their thing. I can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s coming in 2019\u2014as long as it isn\u2019t another salad kit!Photo by Chelsie CraigHoliday Frosted Sugar Cookies, $1.99These grocery-store frosted sugar cookies with sprinkles were some of the first things I reviewed in 2018, so it felt full circle (get it??) to have the holiday version with red and green sprinkles to end the year. These weren\u2019t announced as \u201cnew\u201d but I felt the need to try them, and all the holiday cookies I saw, anyway. As always, they\u2019re amazing. It\u2019s a soft, buttery, cake-like cookie with teeth-shattering sugar frosting. If this doesn\u2019t make you happy, I don\u2019t know what will. (Maybe money!?)Photo by Chelsie CraigTwinkling Trees Sugar Coated Sugar Cookies, $3.99I appreciate the moldy looking green needles on these harder sugar cookies. Sort of the ugly sweater of holiday cookies (more so than actual ugly sweater cookies, below). The green sprinkles are actually wonderfully crunchy, and the cookie acceptable in its plainness and extreme saltiness. We could all see eating 27 of these at a corporate holiday party, sipping spiked punch, and cringing at the boss\u2019s year-end speech before the layoffs hit. Santa likes.Photo by Chelsie CraigUgly Sweater Cookie Kit, $5.99What\u2019s inside: Three muted frostings in bags, two packs of dry, hard cookies in sweater shapes, and a bag of holiday-themed sprinkles. We found the red frosting very watery, green was gooey. One colleague ate the frosting straight saying, \u201cI love how it\u2019s just sugar!\u201d You squeeze and work slowly, but it\u2019s tricky business! My attempt to draw a beer can on a sweater failed, but succeeded in its ugliness. Which is a nice lesson for us all.Photo by Chelsie CraigMini Dark Chocolate Mint Stars, $2.99These are the best. They\u2019re the size of a quarter (unless you get two stuck together, in which case, 50 cents) and very crunchy, meaning you end up eating them by the handful. The white dots of nonpareils (I have no idea how to say that) make them even more texturally delightful. There\u2019s a Thin Mint vibe, but honestly, better. Because of those twinkling sprinkles! And the fact that they\u2019re sturdier, unlike that thin cardboard quality that Thin Mints have. Santa loves.Photo by Chelsie CraigBlue Cheese Mustard, $2.99Thank goodness there aren\u2019t any chunks of blue mold in here, that would\u2019ve been freaky. Instead it\u2019s a thick mustard with a little funk, a lot of sugar and salt, and a hint of that dry, crumbly texture of blue cheese, but just barely. This would be great with those big soft pretzels (reviewed below!), or on a roast beef sandwich. There\u2019s tamarind syrup in there? Huh.Photo by Chelsie CraigB\u00fbche de No\u00ebl (Yule Log) Ice Cream, $2.99There are people who love artificial cake flavor and those who are too real for such flights of fancy. I love the fake stuff, especially wedding cake sno-cones. YUM. This ice cream has that quality, with chocolate cake pieces, swirls of chocolate ice cream, and that\u2019s about it. Simple, delicious. Loggy? Not so sure.Photo by Chelsie CraigOrganic Italian Artisan Striped Garganelli Pasta, $2.99Ooo candy cane pasta! Yep, that\u2019s the idea. Too bad the beet juice in the red dye ends up leaching out into the pasta water, turning it bright pink, and then fading off the noods. Some of my gargies unraveled like ancient scrolls released from their wax seals. They looked sun-bleached and waterlogged by the time the 15 minute cook time was up, not nearly as festive as they began, like my lip stain at the end of the holiday party.Photo by Chelsie CraigMint Flavored Fudge Brownie Bar, $5.99A frozen brownie < room temperature or warm brownie. It was dense. The cold makes it lose some gooeyness. The chocolate ganache (aka FROSTING) was nice, and the crunch from the 14 total sprinkles on top was awesome in the few bites blessed with them, but we wanted more mint ice cream filling! Still, it\u2019s hard to be mad with what is essentially a giant frozen Andes mint cake, and it looks pretty all sliced up.Photo by Chelsie CraigSnowflake Pastry with Almond & Cocoa Filling, $5.99Sort of a big, misshapen cinnamon roll, but the proportions are out of whack. There\u2019s too much tasteless, kinda dry bread until you get to the sweet filling, causing uncivilized coworkers to pick and pull at it like trash can raccoons.Photo by Chelsie CraigButter Toffee Pretzels, $2.99Controversial! These salty pretzels are unevenly dipped in a butter pecan-y sugar coating that\u2019s sandy in texture, like you\u2019d dug it out of the playground sandbox. I found this to be utterly delicious. Others noted: \u201cThis is not meant for human consumption.\u201d You decide!Photo by Chelsie CraigChampagne Gummy Candies, $1.99My cashier was pumped about these. She told me when they came in, the staff ate tons of them in \u201cback.\u201d (Is that where all the new stuff is hiding from me?). Unfortunately my colleagues felt differently. \u201cIt tastes like champagne left out from last night\u2019s party that you drink in the morning anyway,\u201d said someone who\u2019s clearly done this. They\u2019re sweet but cloying, and too soft, according to some gummy experts. The overwhelming smell wafting from the plastic bag alone will make you feel instantly hungover.Photo by Chelsie CraigGluten Free Blueberry Bagels, $4.49Gluten-full blueberry bagels are patently bad, so these had the whole world against them. The pungent dried blueberries trigger a gag reflex before you even open the bag. The texture appears bagel-like, but then crumbles in your mouth without disintegrating. It\u2019s a feat of science, and it\u2019s trying to kill me.Photo by Chelsie CraigHorseradish Aioli, $2.69Sweeeeeeeeeet. And missing that masochistic horseradish nostril-tingling burn. Pass if you prefer pain.Photo by Chelsie CraigDouble Chocolate Hot Cocoa Spoon with Mini Marshmallows, $0.99Cute in theory but a bummer in execution. The chocolate didn\u2019t quite melt off the flimsy black plastic hotel breakfast buffet spoon, and then the chocolate flecked off, even when I used a whisk to blend. The marshmallows were dried out like winter elbows, and they never rehydrated to full bouncy glory. Meh, it\u2019s 99 cents.Photo by Chelsie CraigGinger Ultra Moisturizing Hand Cream, $4.99A good one!!! I was worried this would be too artificial, but it\u2019s lightly fragrant, sweet, with a hint of fresh ginger. It smells clean. The cream isn\u2019t too thick, thin, greasy, or sticky. Honestly a solid office hand cream choice. The metal tube inside reminds me of L\u2019Occitane. Classy, Joe!PreviouslyThe week of November 26Photo by Chelsie CraigBig Soft Pretzels, $2.49/bag of 4As advertised, these frozen pretzels are big and soft. I pre-heated an oven in the test kitchen to make these for my colleagues. While food editors around me developed recipes using digital scales and big knives, I rubbed water on some pretzels and dipped them in a plate of salt. Molly Baz stopped by to tell me, \u201cyou look uncomfortable.\u201d Kat Boytsova informed me that the pretzels were Bavarian-style, which you can tell by the thin inner dough (to get crispy) and the slit to let steam escape at the bottom. And get this\u2014they\u2019re very good! Kat agrees! The dough is tender and well-salted so they don\u2019t taste like chewy air. Must dip in the spiciest mustard and eat with beer, I don\u2019t care what time it is.Before the salt dip.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigPhoto by Chelsie CraigBrussels Sprouts Saut\u00e9 Kit, $4.49Precut cruciferous vegetables really smell like farts. So opening this bag was like setting of a stink bomb on a substitute teacher. The plastic bag filled with mini plastic bags greeted me like an old frenemy\u2014how many salad kits have I bought this year? TOO MANY. This is my favorite though. Toppings include: a bag of Parm, crushed hazelnuts, and lemon-garlic dressing, which was sickly sweet. My $5 idea: do everything the same except throw a whole lemon in there instead of dressing. Everyone knows trimming brussels is a pain in the A, so I\u2019ll take them pre-chopped any day; the toasted hazelnuts are great; the parm shards weren\u2019t too dried out. After a 5-minute saut\u00e9 in a cast iron pan to get the brussies caramelized and crispy, a squeeze of lemon and salt was all they needed.Photo by Chelsie CraigCaramel Cookie Crunch Gelato, $3.49LOVE this not-Talenti! It had the texture of an airy, fluffy milkshake\u2014maybe because it melted so fast. Vanilla was eggy and creamy. The alleged cookie crunch was Carmen Sandiego\u2013level MIA, but I\u2019m not about to go looking for it.Photo by Chelsie CraigCauliflower Pancakes, $3.99For all of the fanatical people out there blogging about their L\u2764\ufe0fOVE and PASSION for those gummy cauliflower gnocchi\u2014which are terrible\u2014there needs to be three times as many fans for these cauliflower latkes. They\u2019re way better! Once fried on the stove for around 8 minutes, they\u2019re crispy on the outside, and inside are like mashed potatoes with leeks, but instead of potatoes it\u2019s cauliflower, Parmesan, and a ton of different starches. Mmm starches.Photo by Chelsie CraigVanilla Bean Infused Vermont Maple Syrup, $9.99Take watery, cheap maple syrup and disguise it with a vanilla bean. This is genius. And not very good.Photo by Chelsie CraigCrispy Quinoa Stars, $3.49Can\u2019t help but point out that these really look like dry cat food. And they have that musty quinoa taste and a crunchy-dense texture; I tried to mask it all with vanilla maple syrup (see above!) to no avail.Photo by Chelsie CraigVegan Banana Bread, $3.99It\u2019s easy to hate on vegans and their often dry, eggless baked goods, and anonymous internet commenters seem to make an unpaid, full-time gig of it. But I find it pretty easy to coexist. In fact this banana bread was damn good! Moist and dense, very banana-y, and uncomplicated. Some people wished it had more cinnamon, chocolate chips, yada yada, but it was a great afternoon coffee snack. The two sad walnuts on top are sad.Photo by Chelsie CraigPepita Salsa, $2.99\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 They did a good one! This salsa is so great. I saw the smooth, grainy texture and was very skeptical. But the heat here, the HEAT, baby! I need it! There\u2019s mostly tomato and onion in there, and there\u2019s bit of oily separation happening, but this salsa has got it going on. It = chipotle powder. My dipping vessel of choice: Tostitos scoops, which happened to arrive at our office on TJ day. #notsponsored but #opentoitPhoto by Chelsie CraigSoft Honey Nougat with Almonds, $3.49Creamy and exactly what you\u2019d expect, with a powdery coating from powdered sugar and wafer paper, which is how you wish paper tasted when you were a kid. Sweet and dissolvable, instead of like lead pencil shavings and cubby smells. My notes include \u201cnice nougat holes\u201d and \u201cfancy sponge.\u201d So...yeah.Photo by Chelsie CraigPhoto by Chelsie CraigNutty Popcorn Trio, $6.99This is the present your mom buys six of for all of your teachers for the holidays. It\u2019s a tube of three plastic bags of caramel corn, and while I thought they\u2019d be more like caramel corn and candied nut mixes, the nuts were hiding better than that trash bag full of Christmas presents in your mom\u2019s closet. (SENSE A THEME HERE?) Great, more fuzzy socks with grippy soles.  I literally never wear those any other time of year. The popcorn\u2019s fine.The week of October 15Photo by Chelsie CraigChocolate Salted Caramel Mug Mix, $1.99 (box contains 2 packets)My first mug cake!!!! What a journey this year has been. I\u2019ve really grown as a person. But my cakes have shrunk! Instructions: Pour a packet of cake dust into a mug, add water, and stir 20 seconds in the microwave, pause to add in two caramel candies (included), and finish for a final 20 seconds. While my cake appeared done, it was not. Beneath the cake roof was molten chocolate, all lumpy and slimy from what I suspect was insufficient mixing on my part. I resigned myself to eating the chocolate stew.Autumnal Harvest Alfredo Sauce, $4.99Be still my colon! This heavy cream and cheese sauce did things to me. Unspeakable things. I don\u2019t think my body can digest dairy any more? Whatever. It\u2019s a pumpkin and butternut squash cream sauce (plus parm and gruyere) spiced with black pepper and nutmeg. To offset the sweet with HEAT, I added chile crisp and highly recommend that move. When I went for a second serving, the sauce had begun to solidify in an orange cement around clumps of pasta. That didn\u2019t stop me.Photo by Chelsie CraigBrussels Sprouts Chips, $2.69WE LIKE. These are the Bizarro World Doritos. And they\u2019re great! Extremely dippable, hearty texture. The predominant flavor is corn, like a fresh corn tortilla. Unexpected and wonderful! You don\u2019t taste brussels sprouts...at all, but you definitely taste garlic and onion. Suzette, my cashier, told me her three-year-old daughter loves these, but don\u2019t dip them in the TJ roasted garlic hummus, it\u2019s just too much. Thanks, Suzette!You vs the cauliflower she tells you not to worry about.\nRiced Cauliflower Bowl, $2.99Too chunky!!!Birthday cake corn.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigBirthday Cake and Candy Corn Popcorn, $1.99Novelty popcorn for novelty people. That\u2019s me! The birthday cake version has a blurry brown color and a notable omission of sprinkles. Festive! Shoulda added sprinkles, Joe! Missed opportunity. Candy corn was orange and bright yellow, always a jarring color in food that isn\u2019t bananas. I love the Rocko\u2019s Modern Life font, too. It tasted like caramel corn between you and me and the Jack-o-lantern. Only a few people in the office could detect its real flavor. The photo team (I SEE YOU OUT THERE) ate an entire bag, but I\u2019d planned ahead: I bought two.The other one.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigPhoto by Chelsie CraigCaramel Apple Flavored Granola, $3.49WE LIKE, PT 2. This is a textural playground of fall flavors!! Check out those little pieces of dried apple rings stuck with toasted, shiny oats\u2014delightful! The caramel apple flavor comes through like a $2 dollar bill in your trick-or-treat pillowcase. How\u2019d that get in there? Who cares, it\u2019s AMAZING. I\u2019m typing on a freaking SUGAR HIGH. The package suggests adding milk and microwaving the granola, a first for me, and WHAT A GOOD IDEA. Some pieces stay crispy while the considerable amount of sugar flavors the milk. GAH SO GOOD.Photo by Chelsie CraigGluten Free Mac & Cheese, $3.49Six hundred calories of gloopy gloppy goo. Gluten-free cheese soup with mushy noodles that slide about the coated cardboard container. Is this what it\u2019s like to be gluten-free? I thought it would feel healthier. Maybe that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be for Halloween this year, since it\u2019s so terrifying.Photo by Chelsie CraigJoe Light Roast Ground Coffee, $3.99We\u2019re not looking for nuanced notes of Earl Grey and dulce de leche here, just like, coffee. Tastes like coffee.Photo by Chelsie CraigChipotle Vegetable Quesadillas, $3.49/box of 2Instructions say to wrap in foil and then bake for 15-20 minutes, turning every 5. Obviously I turned them only once. I\u2019m making frozen quesadillas in the OVEN, this isn\u2019t a time for culinary nuance. Everything was not bad. The tortilla was more like a pita, thick and chewy, while the beans and corn  were bound by gooey cheese. Hard to argue with that.Photo by Chelsie CraigRamen Soups, $1.29You know what this is. Vague chicken powder broth with curly American Girl doll hair noodles that taste to match their price\u2014next to nothing! Added hot sauce, ate the whole bowl, chugged a bottle of water, moved on.Indian Fare: Tikka Vegetables or Yellow Tadka Dal, $1.99GUEST REVIEWER!! Indianish author and BA contributing writer Priya Krishna microwaved this squishy bag of dal and sent me her notes. \u201cPretty glum,\u201d she began, noting an unnecessary addition of cream, a lack of fresh spice flavor, and feeling of general disappointment. But something else caught Priya\u2019s eye: \u201cI\u2019m sorry but is that PARSLEY on the front of the package????? It sure looks like it. If so, this is actual blasphemy.\u201dPhoto by Chelsie CraigSparkling Coconut Water with Yuzu, $3.99A cloudy, bubbly soda that tastes like sunscreen dripped into your 7 Up. Just add vodka and you\u2019re in business! (Or maybe out of business, depending on...your business.)The week of October 1Photo by Chelsie CraigHeirloom Popcorn, $1.99The sound of a bag of packaged popcorn opening is on a frequency only zombie office workers can hear. And they come speed-walking to try handfuls of the salty-crunchy stuff. This HEIRLOOM popcorn, made with AVOCADO OIL and PINK SALT, might as well be served with a carafe, it\u2019s so thirsty. We get it! You\u2019re made with buzzwords! The tinier-than-usual but not quite Pipcorn kernels are barely salty, which keeps you coming back for more. The avocado oil doesn\u2019t taste like anything, but how does it make you feel? Righteous. \u201cIf by heirloom, they mean it tastes like something dusted off from the attic, that\u2019s accurate,\u201d commented a snobby colleague. It\u2019s not that bad, but it was a funny quote so I included it here. If someone left me this in their last will and testament, I wouldn\u2019t be mad. It\u2019s more than anyone else has.Photo by Chelsie CraigSpiced Pumpkin Madeleine Cookies, $2.99Nice spice, Joe! Not fake tasting, no overpowering clove, but just a touch of cinnamon. As a madeleine enthusiast and owner of the specialty pan that only makes one thing, I noticed that these don\u2019t have the puffy potbelly that freshly baked cakes, and my cat, do. Whatever! These are moist (so much so that they sort of stuck to each other in the bag) and tender, and they won over the pumpkin haters in the office. Dip it in your coffee, be happy! I\u2019m not stopping you.Photo by Chelsie CraigThai Tea Mini Mochi, $3.49There\u2019s something eerily fleshy about the color and texture of these mochi, made with coconut milk instead of the traditional sweetened condensed milk. The overly bitter black tea-flavored ice cream within has that icy, dairy-free quality that I imagine it would taste like to lick the walls of Superman\u2019s Fortress of Solitude. Once left out for longer than 10 minutes, these begin to melt and their rice flour skin detaches from the ice cream, leaving a woefully \ud83d\udca9 blob stuck to the sides of the plastic container. Uhhhh\u2026..Photo by Chelsie CraigSeltzers With a Splash, $2.99/4-packTried the lemon-ginger, which tasted like a cold-fighting health tonic, in a good way. Suuuuper gingery. For ginger lovers only!Photo by Chelsie CraigABC Bars, $2.99/box of 6Contrary to popular assumption, these are not already-been-chewed bars. Too bad! Could\u2019ve been a nice time for Trader Joe\u2019s to get into performance art. These cocoa powder coated chewy almond butter bars look like dirt, or the squishy black top of the parking lot where my high school marching band practiced for three hours in the hot Texas sun. (People passed out daily.) Anyway. The paste-like almond butter in the center sticks to your mouth and needs salt\u2013bad. I prefer the peanut-date bars tested earlier this year.Photo by Chelsie CraigOrganic Shredded 3 Cheese Blend, $4.49Sprinkle it into your mouth like a child catching snowflakes, see what happens. (They spill all over your floor, the cat comes running.) Each individual shred has the sort of rough but pliable texture of...plastic, I guess. It melts beautifully into a grilled cheese offering the nuanced flavors of not one, but three different cheeses. What are they? I don\u2019t know and don\u2019t really care. It\u2019s cheese.Photo by Chelsie CraigBlack Licorice Treads, $2.49GUEST REVIEWER! Healthyish editor and black licorice fan Amanda Shapiro. \u201cIt's sweeter and less salty than the intense stuff I'm normally into,\u201d she told me, showing off. It tastes like the interior of Good & Plenty, she noted, with the texture of a fruit roll-up, while fun to tear like string cheese. That\u2019s a lot of metaphors, but you get it.Photo by Chelsie CraigOrganic Caesar Salad Kit, $3.99Gloopy!Photo by Chelsie CraigReady To Drink Cold Brew Coffee, $4.99 for 32 oz.Because it was cold and rainy on the day I tasted this\u2014I heated it up. Yep. So what? It\u2019s smooth and medium-bodied (unlike the chest-hair sprouting tar water of some bottled cold brews) with notes of Hershey\u2019s milk chocolate.Photo by Chelsie CraigCarrot Cake Spread, $2.99I love this in theory, which is the same reason I never learned French. The idea is, you spread this on top of a cinnamon raisin and cream cheese bagel, swirl it into oatmeal, or \u201ceat it with a spoon,\u201d which is what I did. And what\u2019s it like? A sugar paste dotted with little crunchy bits of DRIED CARROT. LE HUH? The texture of the astronaut space food carrots was of chia seeds, if they were twice as large and not softened. A distinct knobby crunch you can\u2019t shake. Is there pineapple in carrot cake? It\u2019s present here, like a cell phone going off at the ballet. Some people might enjoy this.Photo by Chelsie CraigOrganic Yellow Lentil & Brown Rice Spaghetti, $2.99A long time ago, rocks in chair on porch, I realized that if I\u2019m going to eat pasta, it\u2019s going to be regular-ass pasta. This bean business, which has the flaxen hue and stick-like texture of scarecrow hair, is too far a cry from the original. It never quite reaches the chewy, silky texture of your usual spaghetti. If you\u2019re gluten-free, I\u2019d recommend a bag of Trader Joe\u2019s brown Basmati rice.Photo by Chelsie CraigThailand Mae Kah Jan Chiang Rai Small Lot Coffee, $8.99/12 oz. bagThis had a surprising (and near transparent) light body, considering most TJ coffee tastes like too-strong hotel room coffee and that the packaging said...bold.Photo by Chelsie CraigOld Fashioned Waffle Cones, $2.49/box of 12Really proud of Joe for keeping all of these intact in their foam packaging. I loved the near-burnt toast flavor and appreciate the sturdy structural integrity. Imagine this: Cone. Insert single jumbo marshmallow at the bottom. Squirt a spiral of caramel sauce on cone interior. Insert one scoop of ice cream. Add layer of crushed potato chips. Top with second scoop of ice cream. Repeat until overfloweth.Photo by Chelsie CraigUncured Ham & Swiss Cheese Flaky Croissant Dough Squares, $4.99There\u2019s a sort of Humpty Dumpty quality to this product. Each individual dough boy, a soft rectangle of pre-cut puff pastry, comes in a plastic bag where cheese and tiny ham cubes have scattered about. Once you put all back together again, you throw it in the oven until the dough is golden and cheese melted. In that time I googled \u201cuncured ham\u201d and contrary to my assumptions of something special, it just means plain, unbrined/smoked/yummy. I guess \u201cplain ham squares\u201d wasn\u2019t on the table, but it was, I\u2019d still eat them. A serving is \u201cone,\u201d so I demolished three, leaving fond greasy memories all over my laptop keyboard.The Week of August 23:Cold Brew Coffee Bags, $5.99Barista Joe makes homemade cold brew one step easier by putting the grounds into palm-sized tea bags that you steep overnight. These little bean bag chairs means all of that fuss where you strain the grounds yourself is taken out of the equation, the convenience level of Velcro shoes. And I love Velcro! The coffee is strong as hell, without the bitterness of hot-brewed TJ coffee. Note: there are only four bags in each package and they recommend two bags per pitcher. Does math for the first time in ten years. Not sure if this adds up to a good deal. But bean bags!!!Organic Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast Strips, $6.99/poundChicken is cut for you.Asiago Cheese, $7.99/poundRemember how revolutionary the asiago bagels at Einstein Bros. Bagels were? Imagine my shock and disappointment when I moved to New York only to discover they didn\u2019t pre-melt cheese on their bagels. Slightly nutty asiago\u2014Parmesan\u2019s more mellow cousin\u2014has slowly grown in popularity in the past decade, and here it is all by itself in a slightly greasy wedge that I grated into malfatti (great idea). The crumbly, near-rubbery texture means I\u2019ll pass on it for cheese plates; it\u2019s a shredder all the way.Cheese Party Tray, $5.49Speaking of cheese plates I\u2019ll pass on, this party tray contains shingled rectangles of swiss, cheddar, pepper jack, and colby jack. Those are SANDWICH cheeses, not party cheeses, JOE. Where\u2019s the GD triple creme?! As they sat out in the black plastic tray fit for a party in a car dealership break room, a sheer layer of cheese sweat formed, which gave each slice a hardened edge. Not unlike someone who\u2019s been reviewing Trader Joe\u2019s products for eight months.Mini Sheet Cakes $4.49Ooooh cake! Someone DMed me on Instagram that they loved the Chantilly Cream Vanilla Bean sheet cake so much that they tracked down the original bakery and commissioned them to make a larger version for their wedding. Isn\u2019t that incredible?! And I can see why: the charmingly off-center frosting is sweet and buttery with flecks of real vanilla, while the moist cake is lightly spiced. Which reminds me! I also forgot to tell you guys that I recently saw a happy couple on their wedding day, making a Trader Joe\u2019s stop en route to City Hall. Suit, wedding dress, the whole thing!! They were walking down the (TJ\u2019s) aisle with a bouquet of flowers, beaming with happiness. Everyone in the checkout line wished them congratulations. It was a special moment\u2014for this hardened piece of cheese in particular.Skip the Dark Chocolate Ganache, unless you have a whole gallon of milk at the ready to wash it down.Organic Mediterranean Style Salad Kit, $3.99There\u2019s nothing like the smell of raw, chopped broccoli unleashed from its plastic bag. My notes read: \u201cfarty.\u201d Hey, that\u2019s what they say, I can\u2019t sugar coat it. Or can I? The gloopy sweet red wine vinegar dressing certainly will. This salad kit, like all the others, spawns more plastic bags right as you cut upon the next one. One\u2019s got the dressing, another some shoe leather pieces of sundried tomato, one for crunchy things, one for feta cheese. Despite all of the arts and crafts, I liked the shredded radicchio and romaine confetti, which I\u2019d eat over raw kale any day of the week. I doctored it up with black olives and made a lunch of half the bag.Neapolitan Joe-Joe\u2019s, $2.99Extreme artificial strawberry ice cream flavor overwhelms any hope for equilibrium in these ambitious tri-colored not-Oreo cookies. What I mean is: hella strawberry. I watched my colleague Emily Schultz dissect a Joe-Joe, using the vanilla cookie to scrape the cement-like strawberry creme filling off the chocolate cookie, which she licked off like Fun Dip. WHO RAISED YOU, EMILY? Others took a whiff and walked away. I ate four in a row. You either do, or you don\u2019t.BBQ Seasoned Spatchcocked Chicken, $3.99/pound\u201cThat\u2019s obscene,\u201d Andy Baraghani said when he saw the spatchcocked chicken about to be photographed, limbs splayed open for the world to see. However, it\u2019s a genius selling point\u2014an intimidating-seeming way to cook whole chicken (here\u2019s how to do it at home, backbone removed and wings tucked under for even, crispy-skinned grilling. Or roasting\u2013I cooked it in the oven on a cast-iron. If only they sold plain spatchcocked chickens instead of the pre-seasoned ones (there\u2019s also lemon-rosemary), because it tasted like barbecue potato chips, heavy on the maple syrup and paprika.Organic Hemp Seed Bars, $2.99Healthyish editor Amanda Shapiro chimed in with her professional opinion on these bars, which are \u201cchewy but not too chewy,\u201d and \u201ctaste like nothing.\u201d There ya have it, folks. The agave sweetener is subtle; the only flavor you really taste are the shriveled little bites of freeze-dried blueberry.Simpler Wines Chardonnay Too Uncanny. $2.99Hold onto your velour beach visors! Because Chardonnay joins the lineup of canned TJ ros\u00e9 this summer. The aroma of green apple shampoo paired well with the ice cube I added. There are notes of who-cares-it\u2019s-canned-wine, and papaya-I-think? (Marissa Ross, am I doing this right?) It\u2019s a slightly acidic, not buttery, Chardonnay that I wouldn\u2019t mind stashing in my bag to take to the movies.Read more: All of the New Products at Trader Joe\u2019s in 2018, Part 1Trader Joe\u2019s Newest Products in 2018, ReviewedSo many cookies.
