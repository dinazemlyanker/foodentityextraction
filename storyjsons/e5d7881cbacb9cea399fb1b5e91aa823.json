All the soap and elbow grease in the world, you lament, won\u2019t make a dent in the burnt-on, tacky patina left over from sheet-pan dinners, roasted vegetables, and oat and pecan brittle cookies. It\u2019s time to recycle it and move on, right?If your half-sheet pan is warped and you\u2019re looking for an excuse to upgrade, we won\u2019t stop you. But you can make that dingy cookie sheet shine again, and the good news is that you don\u2019t need to use harsh chemicals or scour until your arm aches to get the job done. Here are some of the best cleaning tips and tools to make your baking sheets look nearly brand-new.What is the best way to clean baking sheets?The best cleaning hack we\u2019ve tried begins with two products that are probably already in your kitchen: baking soda and white vinegar. Plug up your sink, fill it with hot water, and then add in \u00bd cup of each. Baking soda and vinegar live on opposite ends of the pH scale, so mixing them causes a chemical reaction that\u2019ll bubble up like a school science project. This is where the magic happens! Submerge your dirty baking sheet and let it soak for 30\u201360 minutes, then scrub off the grime with a scouring pad, the rough side of a scrubby sponge, or steel wool. The steel wool will likely leave some scratches on your baking sheet, which we\u2019d argue give it character. But if you want the marks to be less noticeable, do your scrubbing in even, circular motions.After buffing the entire surface and loosening all of the residue\u2014this should take a few minutes\u2014wash the baking pan with dish soap and warm water, then dry. Bonus: The combination of baking soda and vinegar will also help clean out your sink drain\u2014because you\u2019re definitely not doing that often enough.Our Test Kitchen's favorite sponges and scrubbers:Photo by Ted \\+ Chelsea CavanaughSkura Style Sponge (Set of 4)$15 at AmazonLaura MurraySteel Wool, 12 Pads$6 at AmazonPhoto by Ted \\+ Chelsea CavanaughKamenoko Tawashi Scrubber$9 at East Fork$7 at AmazonScrub Daddy Sponge$25 at Amazon (4 pack)$4 at Target (single)Even some scrubbing is too much scrubbing. How do I clean my baking sheet with no work at all?The baking soda and vinegar combo is our favorite solution because of its simplicity and lack of harsh chemicals\u2014but there are other tried-and-true cleaning methods. You can also use baking soda with hydrogen peroxide: Sprinkle baking soda in an even layer directly onto your sheet pan, then spray it with hydrogen peroxide until damp. If you let the mixture sit for two hours, you\u2019ll still need to put in some labor\u2014but leave it overnight and scrubbing won\u2019t really be necessary. The chemical reaction between the baking soda and hydrogen peroxide will break up all the gunk, and you\u2019ll merely need to wipe it away with a sponge or scrape it off with a plastic or bamboo scraper before rinsing.Food Grade Hydrogen Peroxide$18 at Amazon$6 at Thrive MarketBambu Pot Scrapers$14 at AmazonI used the last of my vinegar on a giant batch of pickles. Can I clean sheet pans another way?If you don\u2019t have baking soda or vinegar on hand (or were traumatized by middle school science fairs), get yourself a powerful cleaning agent that\u2019ll do the work for you, like Bar Keepers Friend. To use, sprinkle a little over your baking sheet, then add a few drops of water and make a paste. Let it sit for one minute\u2014and not a second longer!\u2014then scrub with a gentle scrubber (skip the steel wool) and rinse the pan. And remember, BKF is INTENSE, so always wear dishwashing gloves when using it.Photo by Ted \\+ Chelsea CavanaughBar Keepers Friend$8 at AmazonPhoto by Ted \\+ Chelsea CavanaughCasabella Waterblock Gloves$8 at AmazonYour baking sheets are clean\u2014now keep \u2019em that wayOnce you can see your reflection in your cookie sheet, the easiest way to maintain that shine is to line your bakeware with aluminum foil or parchment paper. (Hot tip: Precut parchment paper will make you feel like you have your life together.)
