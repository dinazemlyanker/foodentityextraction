Remove from heat; stir until chocolate is melted. Set into a larger bowl of ice water and chill, stirring constantly, until thickened and just starting to lose its sheen, about 2 minutes.Step 2Working one at a time, hold berries by stems and dip into matcha mixture to coat; let excess drip back into bowl. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and sprinkle with sesame seeds. (Depending on their size, you will be able to coat 15\u201320 berries.)

This recipe works great if you choose to use a bar or even wafers.AnonymousAtlanta, Ga5/29/2019Obsessed. Such a fun idea for valentine\u2019s day or spring! l.hg7Louisville, KY2/8/2019This recipe simply didn't work. The white chocolate did not dissolve in the coconut oil, no matter how hard i stirred. As a result it was impossible to get an even coating on the strawberries, so I had to resort to dripping and smearing it on with a spoon. Tasted great but didn't look pretty. Perhaps the chocolate I used (Tollhouse chips) was different from what the author used.AnonymousAustin, TX7/23/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titFruit DessertDessertMatchaOther IngredientsChocolateSpringSummerEasyGluten-FreeHealthyishRecipes you want to make.
