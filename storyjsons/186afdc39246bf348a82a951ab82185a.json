I start daydreaming of the crispy-crunchy-salty something from a caf\u00e9 around the corner, and then my need to save that budget for the weekend quickly snaps me out of it.But it\u2019s not hard to get a restaurant-worthy dish at home that\u2019s just as crispy-crunchy-salty. Enter senior food editor Molly Baz\u2019s new recipe for a thinly pounded, shallow-fried pork cutlet. The pork is tender, juicy, and light, without getting bogged down in grease. Don\u2019t get it twisted though, the crispy-crackly cutlet isn\u2019t the only star in this meal. There\u2018s a whole cast of overqualified and underappreciated supporting actors: A simply dressed, lemony fennel salad, and super quick pickled cherries you never saw coming.With the hunger to fry at the top of mind, I sprinted to grab my supplies. As I stood in the butcher\u2019s shop staring at hefty hunks of pork shoulder I remembered the caution Molly gave a few days before. \u201cMake sure to get meat that has enough fat in it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s pounded out, the tough cut tenderizes and benefits from all of that fat. It\u2019s a better way to get flavor and tenderness.\u201dCut to my steamy apartment. Before a lick of oil touched a pan, I tossed the cherries into a resealable bag and carefully pressed on them until I saw the pits plop out (another Molly tip). You could use this cherry pitter, but the plastic bag method works just as well in a pinch. After fishing out the pits, I added unseasoned rice vinegar, salt, and pepper into the bag and let it sit. This adds a slight savory tang to the cherries, but not a full-on pickle sour.In another plastic bag, I threw in the pork steaks and sealed it, then hammered away. Typically, a meat tenderizer or mallet is ideal, but if it\u2019s been a long week any hard object will do (it was only Tuesday). I used an empty wine bottle. Right as I was starting to worry that my downstairs neighbor would get fed up with the thumping, those beautiful patches of fat started to yield and smooth out. What was once sturdy and tough became softer. The meat, now at about a  \u00bc\u201d thickness, had just the right amount of give, yielding to a prodding finger but still strong enough to stay intact while frying.Then it was time to lightly coat the pork in flour, salt and pepper before a light fry. In one bowl, I mixed powdery things: salt, pepper, and flour. In a second bowl, beat eggs and mustard together. In your final bowl, panko and fennel seeds.With my spread of bowls in front of me, I turned to get the oil going, but felt the looming reminder of past frying failures: Beware the oil temperature. If the oil is too hot, the outside will burn while the inside stays woefully undercooked. If it\u2019s too cold, you\u2019ll get stuck with soggy pork. I knew the oil was ready after dropping in a sprinkle of panko and watching it bubble and float. If the panko sinks, the oil isn\u2019t hot enough. If it burns, that sucker\u2019s too hot. As I dropped my cutlets in, the rolling pops and crackles sounded like an encouraging round of applause as each cutlet glistened and turned to that warm shade of golden brown (about two minutes per side).While the now crispy cutlets cooled on a wire rack, I hopped back over to that salad. Sliced fennel (glad I gave in and got that mandoline), tossed with unseasoned rice vinegar, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. All that acid softens the fennel a bit, and then you add the literal (pickled) cherries on top.Once it was all done, I tried to channel Molly\u2019s plating prowess by carefully arranging fennel fronds like an edible bouquet and sprinkling salt on the cutlet in a brief, soft shower. The result: The cutlet was rich and tender thanks to the smatterings of fat I\u2019d asked the butcher not to shave off. For a bit more boost, I added a swipe of mustard to the side of my plate for prime dipping action. And with each brilliant bite, I grew more and more confident that staying in for a quick homemade feast was the right decision. Now, I have a better meal to daydream about.Get the RecipeCrispy Pork Cutlets with Fennel SaladPounding the meat both tenderizes it and allows for a very quick cook time: a win-win for weeknight dinner.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPork ShoulderCutletFennelFennel SeedCherryPankoRead MorecookingThe Chicken Katsu Recipe Every Kid (and Adult) Will LoveBy Adam RapoportcultureThese Jarred Sour Cherries Should Live In Your PantryBy Emma WartzmanRecipes you want to make.
