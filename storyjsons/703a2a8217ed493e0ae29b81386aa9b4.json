This specificity, to me, is what makes cocktails so delightful\u2014they\u2019re beverages for a time and place, like eggnog (December 1\u201325 and not a day after) or date shakes (I-10 between Cabazon and Indio, California).So when I\u2019m taking a break from drinking and six o\u2019clock rolls around, what I do not want is another can of the off-brand seltzer I\u2019ve been gulping throughout the workday. I want something special, festive, cocktailesque to help me transition from day to night. Right now, that something is Ghia\u2019s Le Spritz, a sparkling canned beverage with all the bitter complexity of an aperitivo but none of the booze.Photo by Nacho Alegre/courtesy Ghia\u00a0Ghia Le Spritz$18 at Drink Ghia (4-Pack)Le Spritz\u2014which, according to my high school French, means \u201cthe spritz\u201d\u2014is the single-serving, ready-to-drink offering from Ghia, an impeccably branded, nonalcoholic aperitif that packs a seriously bitter bite. I tend to cut Ghia\u2019s original offering with tonic or Spindrift, but with Le Spritz, all I have to do is pop the 8 oz. can and grab my favorite rocks glass. The liquid is the color of a dusky, unfiltered ros\u00e9, and the bubbles are present but gentle. Like any good predinner drink, Le Spritz whets your appetite. There\u2019s sweetness from Riesling grape juice and fig concentrate; citrusy and herbaceous notes thanks to yuzu, lemon balm, and rosemary; and a bitter wallop from gentian root, a flowering Alpine plant showcased in aperitifs like Suze and Salers. It\u2019s so complex that it feels like a thoroughly adult beverage, even though it\u2019s zero-proof.No one likes the feeling of deprivation\u2014this is why gluten-free croissants exist, however ill-advised\u2014so when I\u2019m not drinking, I set myself up for success. Sure, I could stick to sparkling water, but why deny myself when Ghia\u2019s Le Spritz fills that cocktail-shaped hole in my heart?Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make.
