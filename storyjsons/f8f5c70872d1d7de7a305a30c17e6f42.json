He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.When this whole thing started, I assumed that most people would turn to BA for the same reasons they always have\u2014recipes and cooking advice.And over the past two weeks, man, we\u2019ve produced no shortage of that content. We\u2019ve served up all sorts of handy slide shows, like 89 Recipes with 5 Ingredients or Fewer\u2014Seriously (special shout out to Andy Baraghani\u2019s Charred Leeks with Vinegar and Honey for taking advantage of an allium with a long shelf life that\u2019s in abundance this time of year). Another favorite of mine is 86 Comfort Foods for Cold Nights, Broken Hearts, and Wednesdays (props to whoever wrote that headline).But as Week 1 of quarantine crept into Week 2, it became pretty clear that our readers, users, listeners, and viewers wanted more from us than just to what to cook. They wanted company.And who can blame them? Isn\u2019t that the reason why so many of us started cooking in the first place? Not because of sustenance, but as a way to bring together our friends, our partners, and our families.So when we posted a video on Friday of our test kitchen editors in their home kitchens (complete with dogs, cats, and kids filtering in and out), the response was overwhelming. Brad and Claire and Andy and Sohla and Carla and the gang let our 5.5 million YouTube subscribers know that the BA Test Kitchen videos would keep on keeping on\u2014except from home, with remote equipment.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Brad, bumbling about at home.\nAnd our followers let us know how they felt, blitzing Twitter, Reddit, and our YouTube comments board.\u201cI literally cried, this made me feel so good and comfortable.\u201d\u201cI just got a little verklempt watching the new @bonappetit video of the crew in their homes. So that's where my emotional stability is charting today. How's everyone else?\u201d\u201cThis was free therapy for me. Haven\u2019t felt this social in weeks.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m crying a little bit lol. I didn\u2019t realise how attached I was to the BA staff. I\u2019ve been watching for years, and hearing them talk about missing each other was so sweet.\u201dAnd it\u2019s not a one-way street. We\u2019re just as hungry to connect with everyone out there. It\u2019s why you\u2019ll spot Sohla on her Instagram stories giving DIY cooking lessons. It\u2019s why Carla will be on @bonappetit\u2019s Test Kitchen Tuesday Instagram series tomorrow at 2pm, checking in with Claire, Chaey, and Delany. And it\u2019s why you can catch the entire test kitchen crew on YouTube tomorrow when it launches its second all-remote group video, wherein each editor demonstrates how to make his or her perfect cup of coffee.The fact that we\u2019re able to keep doing what we do\u2014albeit from different locations with slightly different equipment\u2014isn\u2019t a burden, it\u2019s a privilege.Explore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterRead MoreLifestyleThese Are a Few of My Favorite FatsBy Christina Chaeycooking10 Tips For Keeping Produce Fresh Until Your Next Trip to the Grocery StoreBy Caroline LangecookingCook the Food That Makes You Feel GoodBy Adam RapoportLifestyleCooking at a (Social) DistanceBy Christina ChaeyRecipes you want to make.
