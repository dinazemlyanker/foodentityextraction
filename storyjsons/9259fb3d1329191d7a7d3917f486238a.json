Meh. Rao's jarred pasta sauce. Ok, yeah, sounds good.By Alex DelanyMay 1, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto Courtesy of Rao's/Mathew ZuckerFacebookTwitterEmailWe have a complicated relationship with jarred pasta sauce. Between the no-cook, quick stovetop, and easy butter-roasted options, making your own tomato sauce is pretty easy. But sometimes, you just can\u2019t bring yourself to make sauce. Your day was horrible. Your week was horrible. Your year was horrible. You don\u2019t need to explain. We get it. In that case, we reach for a jar. But not just any jar. We have a pretty loyal relationship with Rao\u2019s Marinara Sauce and firmly believe that it\u2019s the best jarred pasta sauce around. Everyone that works here has daily Rao\u2019s rituals. Songs. Sayings. Handshakes. It\u2019s a cult.OK, we\u2019re not really in a cult. But we do think Rao\u2019s is the best. Generally speaking, jarred pasta sauce is pretty terrible. Sometimes that\u2019s because there are added preservatives or coloring. But mostly, it\u2019s because they taste too sweet, too salty, or maybe even a combination of the two.But Rao\u2019s is none of those things. Rao\u2019s is a pasta sauce that falls in line with the sauces we\u2019d cook, and it starts with the ingredients. Rao\u2019s uses high quality tomatoes and olive oil, without any added preservatives or coloring. The rest of the ingredients won\u2019t surprise you: salt, pepper, onions, garlic, basil, and oregano. You know, the stuff you\u2019d expect to be in tasty marinara. And the biggest omission from that list is added sugar. Which already tells you something about how it tastes.Rao's marinara sauce is very well-balanced with sweetness that comes solely from tomatoes, onions, and garlic. There aren\u2019t any other performance enhancing drugs getting in the way of a balanced tomato sauce.Photo by Chelsie CraigThe flavor tastes...homemade. Yeah, we\u2019d be pretty happy if we made this sauce. It's the kind of sauce we want to spoon over pasta and dip stromboli or calzones in. Compared to other national brands, Rao\u2019s sits on an entirely different plane.While all of these flavors and ratios are important, there\u2019s one ingredient that sticks out more than the rest. In fact, you can tell it\u2019s there immediately. Rao\u2019s uses a large amount of olive oil. You can see it sitting right on top of the sauce, before you even crack open the jar. We love that commitment to the fatty, olive oil-y side of the sauce. That fat is the key to a fantastic, well-rounded marinara.But there\u2019s always an exception to the rule, the thing that makes you amend your beliefs. And in this case, that exception is made from tomatoes, hails from New York, and goes by the name of Rao\u2019s.Buy it: Rao's Marinara sauce, $15 for 15-ounce jar on AmazonAnd once you buy it, dip these calzones in it:Explore Bon App\u00e9titPastaSauceBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
