It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Duchess of PepperoniI\u2019m not going to get into hamberders at this point in the week. There are (actually) 2.7 million other places you can seethe and salivate over that one. The biggest food news for me this week was KATE MIDDLETON MAKING PIZZA with ADORABLE CHILDREN. Not nearly enough fanfare for this. Oh wait. (38,400,000 results.) When a kiddo asked if the Queen\u2019s ever had pizza, the Duchess replied: \u201cYou know, that\u2019s such a good question. I don\u2019t know. Maybe next time I see her, shall I ask?\u201d YES, PLEASE ASK. A million royal bloggers across the world pondered this historic question. No one had answers. In fact, I believe this is what you call Small Talk, but no matter, it\u2019s the Duchess of Pepperoni, and it gets us one step closer to \u201cRoyal Secrets REVEALED!\u201d Peter Morgan, get your research team on this! I need this addressed in the next season of The Crown more than I need anything else, other than ibuprofen and a Diet Coke, right now.When you really love black pepperWee-ooo, wee-ooo! Do you know what that noise is? THE PEPPER POLICE. On Basically this week, Molly Baz wrote about how salt and black pepper work in a dish, daring to suggest pepper isn\u2019t as big of a deal as salting. The headline alone provoked over 1,000 Facebooks comments. My favorite were about the pepper police, which I might add, are a volunteer police department, subsidized by the passion in their hearts for public pepper safety. Rhys turned down the volume on MSNBC, threw his or her hands up in the air, and wrote, \u201cReally? We\u2019ve come to this? Spice shaming?\u201d Katie double checked her notes and declared it the \u201cDumbest argument ever.\u201d Leah time traveled in from 1867 and dropped the word \u201cPoppycock!\u201d David, who can't resist us, said: \u201cthis is why I cancelled a subscription years ago.\u201d While multiple living readers shared the sentiment: \u201cHow bout dont tell me how to live,\u201d \u201cyou should really mind your own business.\u201d And then we all went on our ways, salting and peppering to our hearts discontent. I ...kinda want this on a t-shirt:Here we goMy Trader Joe\u2019s reviews for 2019 have begun. NO, I haven\u2019t been able to find the pancake bread yet. The jackfruit cakes are strange celery-salt patties, chewy, but interesting. The best new thing I tried this week: gluten-free toffee cookies. Heavy on the salt, in a good way. FOR CRUNCHY COOKIE LOVERS ONLY. No softies.Want this letter before it hits the website?

Alyse, thank you for introducing me to the Scrub Daddy and the best damn seaweed snacks on the market. But Alyse, curse you for making me go to one of my biggest social anxiety-fueled nightmares: karaoke. Also, Alyse had to produce and CODE this newsletter, which is a technical, tricky job on an outdated program. Congrats, Alyse!Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensCook this, why dontchaWe were so psyched to have nacho expert Rick Martinez back in the Test Kitchen to develop this Super Bowl nacho recipe. The chile-chicken topping (made with rotisserie chicken, no sweat!), is so good I plan on making it on its own for hashtag meal prep. After the recipe was cross-tested for quality control (seriously), the tray sat on a stove getting cold and soggy. But I watched as bite by bite, hour by hour, people ate every last cold nacho. It\u2019s THAT good.Unnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekAlex LauIn honor of our 200th podcast episode, Rice 3.0 (if you haven\u2019t heard rice episodes 1 and 2, I highly recommend it; you\u2019ll laugh out loud in your car), we\u2019re debating: RICE. PUDDING. The comfort food that we should all be making the next snow day. Chris Morocco agrees with me: \u201cWho doesn\u2019t like rice pudding? Kozy Shack, love it! A really extra chewy rice like Arborio\u2014\u201d then he made this guttural \u201coomph!\u201d noise. \u201cCoconut milk, cinnamon, vanilla, a little lemon peel\u2014\u201d another \u201cOooh!\u201d But Julia Kramer is horrified at the thought. \u201cRice pudding is the most disgusting dessert of all time. First of all, it\u2019s borderline savory, second, do you want to eat oatmeal for dessert?\u201d Rice has a bounce that oats don\u2019t have, JULIA. \u201cIt\u2019s wet sand,\u201d she concluded. \u201cThe texture is\u2014\u201d Meryl Rothstein then made a face that looked like she\u2019d just sniffed a dirty diaper. \u201cBut it\u2019s dessert, so I\u2019ll still eat it.\u201d \u201cKozy Shack? Put that in front of me and I\u2019ll inhale it,\u201d said Amiel Stanek. Adam Rapoport reported from his Mystery Location Out of Office to comment: \u201cYuck.\u201d I guess I won\u2019t be pitching any 15-page rice pudding features anytime soon.Make it!
