Quahogs (large hard-shell clams) can be tricky to find out of season. If you can\u2019t track them down, use topnecks (the same species, just smaller) instead. This recipe is from Larsen\u2019s Fish Market, a tiny little seafood shack in the tiny little fishing village of Menemsha, Martha\u2019s Vineyard.IngredientsMakes 12-1610lb. quahog or topneck clams, scrubbed8oz. stale soft white sandwich bread, torn into 1\" pieces (about 7 cups)1green bell pepper, ribs and seeds removed, coarsely chopped1red bell pepper, ribs and seeds removed, coarsely chopped1small onion, coarsely chopped6Tbsp. unsalted butter, divided\u00betsp. kosher salt, plus more1tsp. crushed red pepper flakesPaprika and lemon wedges (for serving)PreparationStep 1Pour water into a large pot to come 1\" up sides; bring to a simmer. Add clams, cover pot, and steam until clams have opened, 8\u201311 minutes (discard any clams that don\u2019t open). Drain clams and transfer to a colander. Rinse under cold running water to cool and remove any remaining grit. Remove clams from shells. Reserve 6 shells if using quahogs and 8 if using topnecks; discard remaining shells. Break shells at the hinge to separate sides.Step 2Meanwhile, pulse bread in a food processor until fine crumbs form. Transfer breadcrumbs to a large bowl; wipe out food processor. Pulse clams in food processor 3\u20134 times to coarsely chop. Add to breadcrumbs. Wipe out food processor again and pulse bell peppers and onion until finely chopped.Step 3Melt 4 Tbsp. butter in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add bell pepper mixture and \u00be tsp. salt and cook, stirring often, until vegetables are very soft, 10\u201312 minutes. Add red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add vegetable mixture to bowl with breadcrumb mixture and mix well; season with salt. Let stuffing cool.Step 4Position a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 450\u00b0. Melt remaining 2 Tbsp. butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Fill each half shell with a generous heap of stuffing; arrange on a rimmed baking sheet. Brush with butter and bake until hot and beginning to turn brown in spots, 8\u201310 minutes.Step 5Sprinkle clams with paprika and serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over.How would you rate Stuffed Quahogs?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (1)Back to TopTriangleDeee-lish!A cook from BuffaloBuffalo, NY11/2/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titNew EnglandAmericanClamShellfishSeafoodBell PepperVegetableSummerStarterNut-FreeDinnerRecipes you want to make.
