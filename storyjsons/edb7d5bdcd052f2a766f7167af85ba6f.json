Have a question? Email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.How do you have a socially distant Super Bowl party? \u2013Sociable ShawnaWhen we have our friend Noah over to watch football (my comfort level for guests is one), we watch outside on a TV atop a card table. Six feet between us, masks on, extension cords everywhere, individual plates of food. Is the great outdoors not for you? Make yourself a personal serving of queso and enjoy the fact that you can actually watch Bridgerton instead.\u00a0Illustration by Cari Vander YachtIs it legal to make the snacks but not watch the game? \u2013Abnormal AnaI am here for the superior snacks of sport. How many grown adults have you seen wearing sweat-wicking jerseys to watch a game on a couch? Same principle, we\u2019re just fans of different teams. Team bread bowl all the way. Whoop for the open kitchen concepts on Fixer Upper, boo at the 15-car garages on Selling Sunset, watch whatever you want. What\u2019s important is that we get a random winter day to gorge on cheesy, saucy, meaty snacks because we have something, at least ONE THING, to cheer for.As a registered dietitian, am I expected to serve a plate of vegetables? \u2013Misdirected MaggiYes! This is your MOMENT. \u201cPlate of vegetables\u201d is just bad marketing. There\u2019s so many snazzy healthy Super Bowl snacks out there on Healthyish, from broccolini cheesesteaks to ranch fun dip to crunchy seaweed snack things. I have been intrigued by buffalo cauliflower for years, though admittedly I don\u2019t get out much.Can I ask if there\u2019s canned chicken in the Buffalo chicken dip? \u2013Realistic RyanWhat\u2019s the point? You\u2019re going to eat a pound of it regardless and say things like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we eat this year-round?\u201d \u201cI just can\u2019t STOP eating this!\u201d \u201cThe diet starts tomorrow!\u201d Enjoy it!You can\u2019t double-dip in the era of COVID-19. But will we ever return to double-dipping? \u2013Longing LadkiYou can double-dip all you want in your own personal bowl of dip! But even in a post-pandemic world, humans will never get over the double-dipping taboo. I think every time we see someone double-dip, we picture ourselves tongue-kissing that person, which can be horrifying or super cool depending on the person. But now that we know what power microscopic spittle can wield, shared dips are a thing of the past, like Costco samples and the term \u201ctongue-kissing.\u201dIllustration by Cari Vander YachtWhat are the most sanitary Super Bowl snacks? Does everyone get their own cheeseball? \u2013Brainstorming BriannaAn extra-contagious pandemic is raging. If you\u2019re having a distant \u201cparty,\u201d it\u2019s easiest (and laziest) to have everyone bring their own snacks. It\u2019s that, or you create individual platters for everyone/pod, which is exhausting. NOTHING COMMUNAL. Here are some past offerings from my exclusive backyard sports bar:Baked peppercorn wings, distributed by tongsPersonal. Pan. PizzasA quarter sheet tray of nachos per personBYO Lamb shawarma gyrosPigs in a blanket but the blanket is a Lysol wipeDeconstructed seven-layer dip, one layer per personThose hotel breakfast-sized boxes of cereal where the box is also a bowlPopeyesAre you allowed to eat your sister\u2019s leftover wings when she disgraced them by not eating all the meat? \u2013Mooching MariahThis is beyond the scope of my invented expertise.Illustration by Cari Vander YachtCan I eat only the guacamole layer of the seven-layer dip? \u2013Sacreligious SadieThis offends me to my Tex-Mex core! No! My Aunt Yolanda didn\u2019t spread lard-fried refried beans, drain homemade pico de gallo, evenly sprinkle cheddar cheese (not easy!), and sculpt seven symmetrical layers into an aluminum pan to be disrespected like this. Now this isn\u2019t as bad as people who blot the grease off pizza, but it\u2019s getting close. Enjoy the chaotic symphony of textures and flavors!Illustration by Cari Vander YachtWhat about this one: Can I eat the top layer of nachos and then leave the bottom layer of bare chips? \u2013Bottomless BeccaYeah, this checks out. But people: cheese the first layer, then cheese the second layer. Full-coverage nachos are easier to come by than full-coverage bikinis these days, but I want to believe in a world that has both.My partner loves wings. LOVES them. Is it ever okay to tell him that the way he eats them is disgusting? Licking of fingers included. \u2013Kritical KaraEveryone eats wings like a flesh-starved vulture; that\u2019s part of the beautiful carnivorous experience. It\u2019s not just your partner.
