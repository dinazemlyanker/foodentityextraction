The inaugural list celebrated trailblazers who made a difference in the restaurant industry during the pandemic, and the award recipients gathered to meet each other and some of the Bon App\u00e9tit team. Editor in chief Dawn Davis was joined by Cond\u00e9 Nast U.S. artistic director Anna Wintour and advisor Marcus Samuelsson in congratulating those in attendance.The cocktail hour featured a drinks and hors d'oeuvres menu created by the Press Lounge\u2019s culinary director, Sofia Schlieben, in partnership with three mentees from a mentorship program run by honoree the LEE Initiative as part of their ongoing work to promote gender equity in culinary leadership positions. \u201cThe LEE initiative grew immensely during COVID,\u201d said cofounder Lindsey Ofcacek at the beginning of the evening, \u201cWhen it came to launching our women chefs initiative, we didn\u2019t have an office space or kitchen. Chef Lee donated his home in Kentucky to the initiative, and thanks to our partners at Monogram Luxury Appliances, we were able to build that entire space out with a top of the line kitchen for all of our mentees to do demos, recipe testing, and really just be proud of the space that they're in.\u201dWhile bites and drinks\u2014including sunchoke pierogi with sunflower seed romesco, fried pork rillette with apple and mustard chutney, and the guest-favorite peaches and herb speciality cocktail\u2014circulated, BA caught up with chef-owner Reem Assil and general manager Bertha Greene of award recipient Reem\u2019s California to hear about the next phase of expanding worker equity at Reem\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019re just enjoying the journey,\u201d began Assil. \u201cNo matter what comes from this process, in the end, the byproduct of engaging with your employees and figuring out what we collectively value, how we want to grow the business together, that's equally as important.\u201d Greene added, \u201cIt\u2019s been breathtaking really, because you can see somebody that started out as a dishwasher and is now baking and is now thinking as a business owner. I\u2019ve gotten the most joy out of seeing my team members growing and learning. I'm learning a lot too. It doesn't matter what your title is. Everybody can learn. Everybody can grow. It\u2019s about learning from each other.\u201dAs the cocktail hour drew to a close, guests ventured onto the roof deck for a seated dinner under the New York City night sky. Over a first course of burrata with roasted and pickled mushrooms, honorees mingled with BA staffers, friends, and each other. Before the evening drew to a close, Eric See, of award recipient Ursula, spoke with BA about what he has in mind for Ursula over the next year. \u201cWe were, very thankfully, successful through the last year. And we haven't seen a significant dip in business or any reason to be fearful of the future. It gives us a lot of hope for the whole concept of creating community and creating safe space, especially for the queer community. That gives me a lot more motivation to continue pushing forward. I don\u2019t know where that\u2019s going to go yet. And so the question is, can we continue this concept in another space in another part of the city and another part of Brooklyn with the same integrity and intention that we set out this time around? What we've learned from Ursula in the last year is that you can operate a business with integrity and intention.\u201dThe Heads of the Table winners focus on their communities, sustainability, and creating a better restaurant industry.
