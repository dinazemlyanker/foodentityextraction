Yang goes on a tirade against these \u201clittle white meat lies.\u201dBy Jimmy O. YangMay 21, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Mat WilliamsActor Jimmy O. Yang stars as Jian-Yang on HBO\u2019s Silicon Valley and will play Bernard Tai in the movie adaptation of Crazy Rich Asians this August. Yang is also the author of the memoir How to American: An Immigrant\u2019s Guide to Disappointing Your Parents. Now he\u2019s adding one more thing to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9: chicken wing crusader for Bon App\u00e9tit.When I was growing up in Los Angeles, my family often frequented El Pollo Loco and KFC. My grandpa told me, \u201cAlways order the dark meat. It\u2019s the good parts; the white meat is rough and dry, and it\u2019s for dummies.\u201d I have lived by that creed all my life. The ultimate for me is chicken wings. There\u2019s nothing better than the tender meat wedged between the bones of a wing. Buffalo wings, baked wings, grilled wings, lemon-pepper wings... I can keep naming wings like Bubba Gump can go on with shrimp. Then one day, someone\u2014some diabolical person\u2014abused my trust in chicken wings to create something called \u201cboneless wings.\u201dFirst of all, are we really too lazy to eat a real chicken wing? I enjoy working my way around the bones and getting my hands sticky with sauce, then licking the sauce off of my fingertips as a bonus. I could practically taste my American citizenship on my tangy fingertips. For the people who prefer to eat boneless wings because of its convenience, they might as well drink Soylent instead of eating at all.THIS IS WHAT WINGS SHOULD LOOK LIKE. FULL STOP.\nAlex LauBased on its name \u201cboneless wings,\u201d I assumed someone had taken the time to debone the wings, which sounded like the fancy labor of a chef like Jacques P\u00e9pin. But I quickly realized boneless wings are no wings at all\u2014they are little white meat lies.Boneless \u201cwings\u201d are nothing more than dry chicken breast cut up into pieces to loosely resemble the size of a real wing. It sounds like a creation from Dr. Frankenstein. Boneless wings are not wings! They are not even dark meat! They are bite-sized insults to my palette and intelligence! Any restaurant who serves boneless wings should be indicted for fraud, thrown in the same prison as Bernie Madoff and the scammers who sell \u201ctruffle\u201d oil that\u2019s nothing more than a bottle of chemically flavored lubricant. I can\u2019t believe we allow this to happen as Americans who value the truth. If people can get away by calling breast meat as boneless wings, what\u2019s to stop someone from selling rat meat as USDA prime rib-eye? What\u2019s next? \u201cLifeless Caviar\u201d\u2014 a fistful of pine nuts packaged in a tin can? Would you like that?! Boneless wings, I\u2019ve had enough of your crap. This ends here.Boneless Wings Gate is an epidemic that stretches from local burger joints to TGI Friday\u2019s corporate office. We must band together as Americans to protect our freedom and truth in chicken wings. We must topple this slimy snake oil scheme of false advertising. We must earn back the trust of America, one bone-in wing at a time. I hereby propose a Supreme Court case that\u2019ll set an example for all future generations who refuse to settle for a lie: The People vs Boneless Wings.I refuse to be lied to anymore, and so should you.Now make our best bone-in Buffalo chicken wings:Explore Bon App\u00e9titChicken WingRead MorecultureSteak Fries Are Garbage and I Will Not ApologizeBy Alex DelanycookingHow to Make Crispy Baked Chicken WingsBy Alyse WhitneyrecipesOur 23 Best Chicken Wing Recipes for Saucy, Finger-Lickin\u2019 FunGallery23 SlidesBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
