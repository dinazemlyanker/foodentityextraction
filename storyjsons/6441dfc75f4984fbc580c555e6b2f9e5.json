It\u2019s one of my most favorite holidays. I love renting long tables and arranging flowers, squeezing 25 people into my apartment, and cooking everything from scratch. It\u2019s very come one, come all.That\u2019s just how it was in my family, growing up in San Francisco. We\u2019d have anyone who was free over: assorted aunties and uncles, a few neighbors, oftentimes a family friend\u2019s son or daughter in the states for college. I\u2019m Chinese American, so our Thanksgiving menu was always a mash-up of those cultures. We had the turkey, the sweet potatoes with marshmallows on top, and then steamed gai lai or bok choy and my grandmother\u2019s no mai fan\u2014sticky rice studded with lap cheong. It was so focused on what, to me, cooking is all about: bringing people together.Photograph by Jenny HuangLast Thanksgiving I celebrated with just my boyfriend and two friends, our little pod. Since we were in the middle of the pandemic we thought, let\u2019s make what we adore. I cooked char siu, which is a Chinese barbecue pork that\u2019s sweet, sticky, tender, and delicious, and my version of no mai fan. This year I\u2019m keeping that ethos but doing things a little differently: I\u2019m going all in.\u00a0I\u2019m making char siu but rolling it up with shiitake duxelles and turning it into Wellington. I\u2019m indulging in the vegetables, with a sweet potato tian speckled with five-spice, roasted brussels sprouts tossed in a flavor bomb of gochujang and brown butter, and a super crunchy Asian pear and shaved cauliflower salad. The no mai fan is a must, and to finish I\u2019ve got a bread pudding with a milk-tea-sweetened custard as a nod to my family\u2019s Hong Kong history. Adding boba to milk tea is de rigueur these days, but I thought in this case it might be gilding the lily too much.No matter how topsy-turvy the world can feel in these times, this is one Thanksgiving menu that makes me smile.The RecipesChar Siu WellingtonThis showstopping centerpiece combines the flavors of very Cantonese sticky-sweet char siu pork with those of very British beef Wellington.View RecipeAsian Pear Salad With Peanut-Lime DressingThis sweet-tart salad gets its satisfying crisp-crunchy texture from floral Asian pears and nutty raw cauliflower.View RecipeDutch Oven No Mai FanThis one-pot wonder of sticky rice studded with sweet and savory lap cheong, umami-packed shiitakes, and other savory bits is the cozy meal your weeknight cooking repertoire needs.\u00a0View RecipeSweet Potato TianThin rounds baked until tender and crispy-edged in a warming five-spice brown butter sauce might just be our new favorite way to serve sweet potatoes.View RecipeRoasted Brussels Sprouts With Gochujang Brown ButterCrispy Brussels sprouts + sweet-spicy gochujang + nutty brown butter = the side dish you can\u2019t say no to.View RecipeMilk Tea Bread Pudding With Cr\u00e8me AnglaiseSweet, bitter, creamy, and so, so good, milk tea makes for an irresistible base for this bread pudding.View RecipeThe PantryKam Yen Jan Chinese Style SausageThis Cantonese cured pork sausage has a distinctive sweet and savory flavor. For me it\u2019s a must-have in fried rice and no mai fan, but I like to toss it into braises and anything else that needs an extra bump of flavor.\n$29 at Amazon (3-Pack)$6 at YamiLee Kum Kee Premium Dark Soy SauceDark soy is thicker\u2014and yes, darker\u2014than the usual light soy sauce with which most of us are familiar. It\u2019s slightly sweet and adds a lovely amber color to anything you add it to like noodles, rice, and chicken.\n$15 at Amazon (2-Pack)$3 at Umami CartKoda Farms Premium Sweet RiceAlso known as sticky rice or glutinous rice, this round-grain rice becomes sticky when cooked and it\u2019s used widely in Chinese cooking (and many other Asian cuisines too). I grew up eating it in my grandmother\u2019s no mai fan, but it\u2019s also great for Thai-inspired coconut sticky rice with mango.\n$22 at Amazon (5 lbs)Mother-In-Law's GochujangI didn\u2019t grow up with gochujang, but now I always reach for the Korean fermented chile paste when I\u2019m looking for a hit of complex heat. I love it mixed with honey for barbecue sauce, Kewpie mayo for a quick dipping sauce, or combined with browned butter for roasted vegetables.\n$13 at Amazon$12 at Snuk Foods\u00a0Lee Kum Kee Hoisin SauceA base of fermented soybean paste gives this rich sauce an umami punch. Hoisin is widely used as a dipping sauce or a glaze, but I also like tossing it with butter and pasta for a quick dinner.\n$6 at AmazonThe TableCourtesy of Lost QuarryLost Quarry Ribbed PlatesMy friend Doris [Josovitz] started this ceramics company a few years ago.
