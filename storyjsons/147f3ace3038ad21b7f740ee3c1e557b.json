There are nutrients and flavors in the bones.\u201d It\u2019s crucial to dry-brine the chicken for at least eight hours, which seasons the meat and gives it time to absorb the floral kick of the mixed peppercorns. A fermented garlic-honey and vinegar glaze helps to mellow out the bite. We used this recipe, but you can also use regular honey or maple syrup instead.Ingredients4 servings2Tbsp. black peppercorns4Tbsp. pink peppercorns, divided6tsp. Diamond Crystal or 3\u00bc tsp. Morton kosher salt, divided13\u00bd\u20134-lb. whole chicken1Tbsp. vegetable oil, plus more for grill2medium Fresno chiles, thinly sliced\u00bdcup fermented garlic honey, honey, or pure maple syrup3Tbsp. Champagne vinegar or white wine vinegarSpecial EquipmentA spice mill or mortar and pestlePreparationStep 1Finely grind black peppercorns and 2 Tbsp. pink peppercorns in a spice mill or mortar and pestle. Transfer to a small bowl and mix in 5 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 2\u00be tsp. Morton kosher salt; set seasoning aside.Step 2Place chicken, breast side down, on a cutting board and use kitchen shears to cut along both sides of the backbone to remove (freeze and save it for stock!). Open chicken and turn skin side up. Press down on center of breast to flatten chicken\u2014you should hear the breastbone crack. Using a chef\u2019s knife or cleaver, split chicken in half through breastbone. Pat dry; rub all over with 1 Tbsp. oil. Sprinkle reserved seasoning all over, making sure to get into all the nooks and crannies. Place on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Chill, uncovered, at least 8 hours and up to 2 days.Step 3Coarsely grind remaining 2 Tbsp. pink peppercorns in spice mill or mortar and pestle. Cook chiles, honey, vinegar, and remaining 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture just turns amber in color and is reduced by about half (it should coat a spoon), 10\u201312 minutes. Stir in pink pepper and set aside.Step 4Prepare a grill for medium heat. Lightly oil grate. Set chicken on grate, cover, positioning vent over chicken if your grill has one, and grill, turning every 5 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of thighs registers 120\u00b0\u2013130\u00b0, 15\u201320 minutes. Uncover and continue to grill, basting with honey mixture and turning chicken every 2\u20133 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of thighs registers 175\u00b0 and 155\u00b0 in the thickest part of breast, 10\u201315 minutes longer. Transfer to a cutting board and place skin side up. Let rest 30 minutes before carving.How would you rate Honey-Glazed Pepper Chicken?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (5)Back to TopTriangleThis is a very good chicken recipe that everybody enjoyed. It looked so good that a vegetarian at the meeting was tempted to try it!AnonymousIthaca, New York8/21/2020This looks beautiful and sounds like it would be amazing but finding these exact ingredients proved to be difficult if not impossible. Fresno peppers aren\u2019t available til late summer or early fall. Pink peppercorns are also hard to come by but I was able to find them. The other reviewers also made substitutions. To make this exact recipe seems unattainable for most. Didn\u2019t actually get to make it the first time, maybe when Fresno peppers are available here I will try again. Sophia901Memphis TN7/2/2020This was SO good! I didn\u2019t have pink peppercorn so used a Szechuan blend and probably about 2 times the amount required (measured ground, not whole, whatever!) also used orange blossom vinegar and added garlic to the glaze because I love garlic. This was delish. Make more glaze that it calls for, you\u2019ll want to drizzle it on afterwards.  AnonymousMinneapolis7/1/2020Sorry, dumb question: does turn mean rotate or flip? If rotate, which side do you put the chicken down: skin side or nonskin side?gpierce112Chicago6/20/2020First things first, this chicken came out great! \nThis recipe was really easy to follow and will definitely make this again.\nI used maple syrup and white wine vinegar. I was able to find most of the ingredients at my local Target. I did use Olive Oil instead of Vegetable Oil.\nI had a hard time trying to find pink peppercorn and Fresno chili's. If you're like me and can't find these, DO NOT substitute the lack of pink peppercorn with more black peppercorn and DO NOT substitute Fresno chili's with Chile Serranos.AnonymousLos Angeles6/15/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titChickenPoultryFresno ChileChileVegetableSummerMainGluten-FreeDairy-FreeNut-FreeGrillingFourth Of JulyMemorial DayLabor DayDinnerRecipes you want to make.
