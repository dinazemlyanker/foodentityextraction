But when you\u2019re on vacation, both the snacking and the drinking should be easy with a capital \u201cE.\u201dA spread of beautiful things to nibble on isn\u2019t about cooking; it\u2019s about curating. You pick up the best product you can find\u2014be it prosciutto di Parma, pimiento cheese, or smoked trout dip\u2014and set it out in a way that facilitates maximum deliciousness. Gently warming the olives. Draping spears of dripping-ripe melon with gossamer slivers of ham. Arranging a few morsels of provolone with pearl onions on toothpicks to ensure that everyone gets a perfect bite. See, snacks make it all possible. They\u2019re what afford you the flexibility to roll with this whole lunch-at-three, dinner-at-nine, no-schedule-but-your-schedule thing. They\u2019re the key to making sure that the second Negroni of the afternoon doesn\u2019t put anyone under the (still-to-be-set) table. And if you serve enough of them, nobody\u2019s going to complain when the dinner hour comes and goes.That dip is basically... cheese and cream.\nPhoto by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott. Prop Styling by Kalen Kaminski.5 Incredibly Easy and Casual Snack IdeasA sweet little pickled pepper wrapped around an anchovy wrapped around an olive? Briny and beautiful, it\u2019s the ideal foil to a tall, bittersweet Campari and soda.Cheese, please! Nuggets of milky mozzarella di bufala paired with bits of mostarda\u2014 chunks of fruit preserved with a touch of fiery mustard oil\u2014make for a study in contrasts.Tiny jarred cocktail onions are good for more than just Gibsons. Add a cube of tingly provolone piccante, a bit of parsley, and a few grinds of black pepper, and it\u2019s practically a salad!Few things taste as unmistakably of summer as sun-warmed cantaloupe coupled with the salty funk of dry-cured ham. Just drizzle with grassy olive oil and eat. It\u2019s a classic for a reason.Think of this as an Italianate queso dip: soft, spicy Gorgonzola dolce mashed with a little heavy cream until it reaches the ideal dippable consistency (see above).Your bar can look like this no matter where you\u2019re vacationing.\nPhoto by Michael Graydon and Nikole HerriottAnd Now CocktailsCocktails on vacation present a conundrum. Everybody wants them; nobody feels like mixing them. That\u2019s the genius behind the spritz bar: Set out plenty of ice, sparkling wine, and a few aperitifs, and let people go to town. It\u2019s the ideal DIY cocktail because there\u2019s no right way to make one. (Go ahead: Google it.) It\u2019s a formula. Fill a glass with ice, add a slug of your spirit of choice, fill it most of the way with bubbly, and top with club soda. Slip in a strip of citrus peel and take a sip. Too boozy? More soda. Too sweet? More Prosecco. Sip, adjust. Sip, adjust. Spritz the afternoon away. Here's how you should stock your cart.Whether you\u2019re spritzing, highballing, or hydrating, an ample supply of fizzy water is key. Buy by the case.An aromatic strip of citrus peel (or whole wedge if you\u2019re into that) makes the simplest drink feel deluxe.Crisp, affordable sparkling wine (think Prosecco) is the vacation pour of choice\u2014 keep the bottles poppin\u2019.Bittersweet aperitifs like Campari and Aperol are the backbone of the spritz\u2014 and useful for stronger drinks too.This is part of our May travel issue, devoted to Italy, subscribe here.Try this Ros\u00e9 Aperol Spritz, too:Explore Bon App\u00e9titTravelItalianCocktail PartySummerRecipes you want to make.
