He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Passover begins on Wednesday at sundown, and were this any other year, my mom would\u2019ve set her Seder table a week ago. And about three months prior to that she would\u2019ve emailed my brother, sister, and me, making sure we had the holiday marked on our calendars. And then she would\u2019ve assigned who\u2019s making what. Dessert is always up for grabs (I highly recommend this chocolate macaroon cake), as is the cocktail-hour chopped chicken liver (the secret: lots of caramelized onion and hard-boiled eggs, and a liberal hand with the seasoning.)What none of us ever get asked to bring is the matzo ball soup. That\u2019s Maxine\u2019s turf. I just turned 50-years-old, and I\u2019m a pretty decent cook, and I have never made matzo ball soup in my life; I\u2019ve never had the chance.The key to success, as my mom will tell you\u2014or, as will Molly Baz, who developed BA\u2019s Best Matzo Ball Soup recipe\u2014is to not get too clever. This is not a dish that needs futzing with.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Watch me and Molly Baz make BA\u2019s Best in the Test Kitchen\nIt starts with a rich, flavorful broth. Molly likes to kick start the process by roasting six pounds of chicken wings, imbuing the liquid with a deep, amber flavor. Both Maxine and Molly endorse a generous amount of fresh dill, one of those herbs that seems to announce the arrival of spring.Then there is the matzo balls themselves\u2014not too big, not too small, maybe the size of a billiard ball. As I learned while riding shotgun in Molly\u2019s matzo ball soup video, how long you boil the balls in well-salted water determines their texture. Too short of boil and they\u2019ll be dense, like undercooked pasta. So take one out as it nears its cooking time and cut into it, just as you would a steak. It\u2019s the only way to know if it needs more time in the pot. Optimally it should hold its shape, but still be tender\u2014almost fluffy\u2014throughout.Of course, this year, I won\u2019t be seeing Maxine for Passover\u2014at least in person. She\u2019ll be in her apartment in New York, staying safe. Around 7 p.m., just as she\u2019s sitting down to her nightly Dewar\u2019s on the rocks, we\u2019ll be sure to FaceTime her (for an 85-year-old, she\u2019s pretty deft with her iPhone.) And I\u2019ll be sure to share with her my matzo ball soup. As I type this letter, I\u2019ve got a pot of fragrant, golden broth burbling away on the stove. I can smell it three rooms over. It might have taken Maxine 50 years, but she taught me well.Get the recipe:BA's Best Matzo Ball SoupThis recipe serves eight people generously (with two balls each) but could easily stretch to serve 16 smaller appetizer-sized portions.View RecipeFind more Passover recipes right here:1 / 73ChevronChevronMamaleh\u2019s BrisketView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterMatzoPassoverRead MorecookingI Thought I Knew How to Make Perfect Matzo Balls, And Then I Tried TheseBy Emily SchultzcookingThe Most Opinionated Editors Came Together to Make BA\u2019s Best Matzo Ball SoupBy Emily SchultzcookingChocolate Macaroon Cake Is the Ultimate Passover DessertBy Alex Delany and Claire SaffitzRecipes you want to make.
