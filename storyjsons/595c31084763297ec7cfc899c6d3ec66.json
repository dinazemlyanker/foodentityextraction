You can find furikake, the Japanese seasoning and condiment, in many store-bought styles, but this streamlined homemade version has just five ingredients and is equally versatile on fish, steamed rice, popcorn, or roasted vegetables.Ingredients8 servings1toasted nori sheet, coarsely torn1Tbsp. mild red pepper flakes (such as Aleppo-style, Maras, or gochugaru)1Tbsp. toasted sesame seeds1tsp. flaky sea salt, plus more\u00bdlemon1\u00bdlb. mixed radishes (such as red, watermelon, and/or black), trimmed\u00becup (or more) cr\u00e8me fra\u00eecheSpecial Equipment:A spice millPreparationStep 1Finely grind nori in spice mill; transfer to a small bowl and mix in red pepper flakes, sesame seeds, and 1 tsp. sea salt. Using a Microplane, finely grate zest of lemon half into bowl and use your fingers to work it into nori mixture (this will keep the zest from clumping). Set lemon half aside.Step 2Cut radishes into a mix of \u00bc\"-thick rounds and 1\"-thick wedges, depending on their size (you just want pieces that are easy to pick up and eat).Step 3To serve, spoon cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche onto one side of a platter or large plate and sprinkle furikake over. Pile up radishes on the other side of the platter. Squeeze juice from reserved lemon half over radishes and sprinkle with a bit of sea salt.How would you rate Radishes With Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche and Furikake?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (5)Back to TopTriangleI basically make this except instead of lemon juice I drizzle EVOO.mikeinwnyBuffalo, NY12/21/2020Simple and delicious. I haven't been able to find any watermelon radishes as of late, but regular reds do the trick. A lovely addition to any summer charcuterie set up.Chef_sadgalLos Angeles7/24/2020sukkah = dukkah :)AnonymousLos Angeles5/12/2020This was really good. Our radishes were spicy and the creme fraiche really mellowed it. We didn't have furikake so used sukkah... I know totally different flavor profile but it was perfect and used what we had. AnonymousLos Angeles5/12/2020Amazing! never thought to put furikake on anything other than asian based dishes, but this one is a go. I eat sliced radishes with fresh salted butter almost every damn day, can't wait to try this one out :) goodbyekissPortland OR4/15/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titCrudit\u00e9DipRadishVegetableNoriSeaweedOther IngredientsSpringEasyQuickSnackStarterGluten-FreeVegetarianKetoHealthyishNew Year'sDinnerRecipes you want to make.
