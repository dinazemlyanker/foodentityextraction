He puts so much care into every hat, from the luxe material to the classic design. Each one is made by hand\u2014and if you go into the Harlem shop, he\u2019ll teach you about what he does. It feels like walking into a record store and talking to the people who work there. You learn as you\u2019re shopping.\u201dPhoto by Jess PettwayFlamekeepers Hat Club Torch MB Dlux Burgundy$150 at Flamekeepers Hat ClubSerengeti Ethiopian Black Tea Blend\u201cEthiopia is known for coffee, but tea has been there just as long. Doughba Hamilton Caranda-Martin III, the founder of Serengeti, is so knowledgeable about tea, and I\u2019ve been lucky to be able to be around that knowledge (he lives down the street from me). This particular blend has spices without being spicy\u2014it\u2019s got cinnamon, cardamom, cloves.\u201dSerengeti Ethiopian Black Tea Blend$18 at Serengeti Teas & SpicesChitlins Sweatshirt\u201cThis is a sweatshirt that creates conversation. I\u2019ve walked down the street wearing it, and older African American women will look at me and be like, \u2018What?! You put the word chitlins on a sweatshirt!\u2019 Or someone younger will say, \u2018Oh, man, that\u2019s dope.\u2019 I love that interaction. Plus, wearing it makes me feel connected to JuneBaby, which is an amazing Southern-inspired restaurant from chef Edouardo Jordan in Seattle.\u201dPhoto by Jess PettwayChitlins Sweatshirt$85 at JuneBabyLemongrass and Lime, by Leah Cohen With Stephanie Banyas\u201cThe flavors in this book are just absolutely incredible. Leah is the chef behind Pig & Khao in New York City, and she makes food that is bright, vibrant, and exceptionally delicious. These are dishes you\u2019ll never get tired of cooking and eating\u2014especially the grilled cod in banana leaf.\u201d\u201cLemongrass and Lime\u201d$24 at Amazon$32 at BookshopThe Spice House Berbere Jar\u201cWhen I smell berbere, I smell Ethiopia. It\u2019s our salt and pepper; it\u2019s good sprinkled on top of everything. This particular one seems spicier than it is\u2014kind of close to a smoked paprika but much more layered. My favorite way to use berbere is in the legendary Ethiopian chicken stew called doro wat. Cooking down berbere slowly with onions and butter really builds the foundation of the dish. I also love to toss it with carrots before I roast them, or sprinkle a simple melon salad to add a touch of spice.\u201dPhoto by Jess PettwayThe Spice House Berbere$7 at The Spice HouseThe Barbuto Cookbook, by Jonathan Waxman\u201cJonathan has been one of my favorite chefs for almost as long as I have been cooking. This cookbook demystifies many of the signature dishes at Barbuto, his beloved New York City restaurant, and teaches home cooks how to do what he does best: treating ingredients simply (and with the utmost respect) to coax out the most flavor.\u201d\u201cThe Barbuto Cookbook\u201d$28 at Amazon$37 at BookshopDanyaki iDeation Aprons\u201cMy friend Hass Kwame makes these colorful hand-painted aprons. When he was a server at Rooster, it was always his goal to run his own business. Now we can support him and his dream by purchasing his durable, stylish aprons. If we have a guest chef, this is the apron we give. It\u2019s from us. It\u2019s of us. It\u2019s our postcard.\u201dPhoto by Jess PettwayDanyaki iDeation Aprons$90 at Danyaki iDeation ApronsThe Nom Wah Cookbook, by Wilson Tang With Joshua David Stein\u201cNom Wah is one of the most legendary dining establishments in New York City. Having been open for more than 100 years, this restaurant has seen Chinatown change and evolve in spectacular ways. However, owner Wilson Tang doesn\u2019t get lost in the past. Instead, he uses this moment to celebrate the Chinatown of now, sharing profiles and recipes that celebrate today.\u201d\u201cThe Nom Wah Cookbook\u201d$27 at Amazon$32 at BookshopMafi Mafi Tibeb Set\u201cIn Ethiopia, it\u2019s cold at night and cold in the morning, with wind from the mountains. People always wear scarves. These are inspired by traditional Ethiopian patterns and handloomed in there.\u201dPhoto by Jess PettwayMafi Mafi Tibeb Set$150 at Mafi MafiIn Pursuit of Flavor, by Edna Lewis\u201cEdna Lewis is one of the most important American cooks. Throughout her seminal cookbook, she tells stories from her childhood in rural Virginia and how that upbringing influenced her views on food and cooking. With her, it\u2019s less about the individual recipes and more about the entire ethos of her cooking\u2014she reminds cooks to celebrate the bounty that is around them.\u201d\u201cIn Pursuit of Flavor\u201d$22 at Amazon$28 at BookshopKristen Kish Cooking, by Kristen Kish\u201cKristen is one of the most supremely-gifted, technique-driven chefs I know. Her talent comes through in all the recipes, like the dead-of-winter vegetable rosti with saffron aioli (a personal favorite!). In this book, she shares her knowledge with folks at home, and for that we definitely owe her one.\u201d\u201cKristen Kish Cooking\u201d$23 at Amazon$40 at BookshopHarlem Candle Company Candle\u201cTeri Johnson, the founder of Harlem Candle Company, has so much local pride and her candles represent that. The way the jasmine interacts with the mandarin notes in this candle\u2014it just smells so good. Also, the design speaks to Harlem. That\u2019s why I really love them.\u201dA Night Club Map of Harlem Candle$60 at Harlem Candle CompanyParwana, by Durkhanai Ayubi\u201cParwana is one of the most beautiful books I\u2019ve ever laid my eyes on. Durkhanai Ayubi combines gorgeous photography, personal narratives, and mouthwatering recipes to tell a complete story of what Afghan food means to her and her family.\u201d\u201cParwana\u201d$32 at Amazon$32 at BookshopHarlem American T-Shirt\u201cWhen I walk down the street in Harlem, I see everyone wearing this stuff. Kids, adults, teenagers\u2014they all rep this classic, comfortable clothing brand. It\u2019s an iconic look of the neighborhood. It reminds me that I\u2019m home.\u201dHarlem American Classic T-Shirt$65 at Harlem AmericanExplore Bon App\u00e9titGift GuidesShoppingChefsHoliday 2020Recipes you want to make.
