Eleven years later, I am here to tell you that it is one of the most useful pieces of servingware I own.It does, of course, come in handy on the two occasions a year when I actually do bake a layer cake. The cloche protects my hard-won frosting from smudges and smears as I move the stand from counter to refrigerator to table. It\u2019s also ideal for the humbler cakes I bake with more regularity, keeping pumpkin loaves and banana breads moister longer.\u00a0But cake stands aren\u2019t just for cakes! Use it in any serving situation where you need a little drama. While you could simply present your cheese platter on a series of plates and cutting boards, add some height with this stand and all of a sudden you\u2019re hosting.However, the best part of this specific cake stand, the thing that compels me to recommend it not just to bakers but to anyone who throws the occasional party, is that it doubles as a punch bowl. Simply turn the base upside down and place the dome inverted on top. It immediately elevates a gathering\u2014even if gatherings these days consist of two friends on the other side of a firepit.\u00a0My only regret is that, when my cake stand is in use as a punch bowl, I can\u2019t use it to display cheese and charcuterie.
