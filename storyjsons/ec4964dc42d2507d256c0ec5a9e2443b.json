Case in point: This easy stir-fry, which, when combined with the trusty #putaneggonit, is irresistible. We use kimchi juice to finish; it keeps the grains moist and gives the dish a kick.Ingredients2 servings \u00bdcup kimchi, plus 3 Tbsp. juice from jar4scallions2Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil2large eggsKosher salt1medium carrot, peeled, cut into matchsticks2cups cooked grains (such as farro, spelt, quinoa, or barley)2tsp. soy sauce1tsp. toasted sesame oilPreparationStep 1Squeeze kimchi over a small bowl to catch juices. Add juice from jar and set aside. Chop kimchi; set aside. Cut dark green tops from scallions and thinly slice; set aside. Thinly slice white and pale green parts and set those aside too. (Whenever you make a stir-fry, you should prep your ingredients in advance, but it doesn\u2019t have to be a whole thing; just scoot these things into their own piles on your cutting board.)Step 2Heat olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Crack eggs into pan; season with salt. Cook, shaking occasionally to prevent sticking, until whites are golden and crisp around edges and puffing up and set near yolks, about 4 minutes. Transfer eggs to a plate.Step 3Return skillet with oil to medium-high heat, add carrot, and cook, tossing often, until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Add reserved white and pale green parts of scallions and kimchi and cook, tossing often, until scallions are just golden, about 3 minutes. Add grains, soy sauce, sesame oil, and reserved kimchi juices; cook, tossing, until grains are slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Season with salt; divide between plates. Top with eggs, then nori, sesame seeds, and reserved scallion tops.Read More: The 29 New Essential Recipes from the Bon App\u00e9tit Test KitchenHow would you rate Kimchi-Fried Grains?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (9)Back to TopTriangleHow much nori?  How much sesame seeds - are they toasted?VirginiaDetroit1/16/2022I have made this with rice but tonight I used cauliflower/broccoli rice and both were very tasty but different. Originally I used a Korean kimchi but tonight I used a new product from Woolies and preferred the more authentic taste of the Korean version. \nOverall an easy to prepare dish which is very tasty.VegieRoseSydney Australia 7/23/2021This is SO GOOD.  I used locally made kimchi from a vendor at my farmer's market and farro for the grain.  I also added some leftover braised pork shoulder and used more than 3 T of the kimchi juice.  Topped with the eggs and then a drizzle of Zhong Dumpling sauce (from Fly By Jing).  Just writing this is making me crave it again!MBChicago5/2/2021I absolutely love this recipe. Perfect go-to dish for lunch. Haven't tried with cooked grains. But I've had it with white rice, brown rice but I think black rice is my fave. It looks so pretty too with the purple from the black rice. Reheats well for leftovers the next day. I don't reserve the scallion tops and just cook them all together. I usually add in a bit of chopped onion at the same time as scallions. Occasionally stir in a bit of gochujang like a reader suggested which adds a nice kick! Sydney10/27/2020Really good. I would highly recommend adding some raw kitchen in the bowl at the end if you really want that flavor. Otherwise super easy and yummy!Anonymous5/27/2020Lovely. Staring at the bottom of my empty bowl and debating whether to finish off the other serving. Used barley and added some kale in with the carrots. (Note: nori and sesame seeds aren't listed in the ingredient list.)JDMcVancouver4/24/2020Insanely delicious and easy! I used farro and added frozen edamame. Such a flavorful dish to throw together with pantry ingredients. AnonymousSan Diego4/21/2020Great recipe! I fried a small onion in butter and veg oil before adding the kimchi. Added a teaspoon or two of gochujang too. I like to shave a carrot into ribbons with a peeler and saute w salt and pepper until tender and put it on as a topping, but that's just a personal preference :)AnonymousMinneapolis4/6/2020A hidden gem! I added a little onion in place of the scalion, and I used farro! So delightful!
