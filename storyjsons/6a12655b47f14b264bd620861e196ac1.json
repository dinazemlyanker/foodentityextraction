To Charge People at a Potluck?And more etiquette questions that are crucial this Thanksgiving week\u2014but really for all time.By Alex BeggsNovember 18, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailWelcome to \u201cIs It Ever Okay,\u201d Bon Appetit\u2019s etiquette column. Have a question? Email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.\u201cRecently, a friend hosted a potluck. I baked a dessert and a side. But then afterward, a friend of the host texted, \u2018Hey, we divided the cost of [the host\u2019s] groceries so everyone owes $10.\u2019 Wait, what? I thought the point of bringing food was to pitch in to the meal, while other guests showed up with six-packs or nothing. How do I avoid this in the future?\u201d \u2014Kate R.THIS IS CRAZY. This friendship is OVER. If someone financially needs to charge you for groceries, and knows their deadbeat friends aren\u2019t going to bring anything or are terrible cooks, fine, there are circumstances where this makes sense (college?). But you have to put that front and center in the invite text/email/Facebook thing/Paperless Post. Otherwise WTF. Kate, you and I bitched about this so I know you already paid this cheapass, but I wish you\u2019d reamed out your friend like \u201clol no, I made freaking homemade mac and cheese! That\u2019s KINDA HARD. It takes time and bechamel! Pay ME for my CHEESE BUDGET. It\u2019s VERY LARGE.\u201d\u201cIf you make Friendsgiving, or any dinner for friends, is there any non-douchey way to hint you\u2019d love some help with the dishes? Or do you just have to know that\u2019s part of the job, even if you don\u2019t have a dishwasher and the sink overfloweth and you\u2019re high-key stressed?\u201d \u2014Sarah W.So many people asked me this! Just DEMAND HELP. What are you afraid of, someone saying no, they just got a manicure? (I\u2019ve said this. But to family! I needed gloves!) Some people weren\u2019t raised right. They don\u2019t offer to do dishes and might sneeze in your cloth napkins and sample all of your sleeping meds, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re anti-dishes. They\u2019re just waiting to be drafted. Here\u2019s the script: \u201cHEY BUTTHEADS, SOMEONE COME IN HERE AND DRY THESE DISHES WHILE I WASH.\u201d I find that \u201cbuttheads\u201d really eases the tension. Sometimes at the table, I\u2019ll start stacking people\u2019s dishes, but I won\u2019t stand up and take them to the sink\u2014that\u2019s key. Instead, I\u2019m sending CLUES. Then others might start stacking plates on their end of the table, then someone might even stand up and bring them to the sink. At this point I\u2019ll call out, \u201cLet me know if you need gloves!\u201d and that\u2019s my extremely effective passive-aggressive way to get people to do dishes for me. Alt: burst into tears and run into the pantry and slam the door and refuse to come out until all the dishes are DONEZO.Snack BreakSwiss Chard\u2013Tahini DipIf you love hummus or baba ganoush, this dairy-free dip will become a new favorite.View RecipeI know this dip looks like baby poop under a microscope but I\u2019ve made it twice in the past month and it\u2019s so creamy good, without ...any... cream. Make it! Then check your teeth after, there are definitely flecks of chard right in front, yep, right there, no, to the right. You got it. Worth it tho.\u201cIs it okay to serve food with bones in it for a dinner party...?\u201d \u2014Chiara S.I mean, are you adding bones into foods that they didn\u2019t originally come from? Because that\u2019s twisted and cool as heck. I\u2019m picturing a quiche with a huge tomahawk bone sticking up from the center like the sword in the stone. Yes to bones. On your plate, in your hair, ground up and baked into your bread.Glazed shallots. You got this, Bex.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Dana Bonagura\u201cI\u2019m responsible for the Thanksgiving sides this year. I would like to make them in advance, and since I\u2019m somewhat lazy, are there any sides that will make me look great in front of my family that won\u2019t force a complete mental breakdown?\u201d \u2014Rebecca P.I dunno Rebecca, do you like canned green beans? You want lazy AND impressive, but that\u2019s a fine line to tip-toe. Thanksgiving is the time to go all out. Slow down, get fancy, try a little harder than usual. You get what you put out into the world. (I heard a yoga teacher say that once, but I think she was talking about the flow of oxygen and carbon dioxide as we breathe in and out. Hard to say.) So to impress your parents and make them forget about your \u201cin flux\u201d state of employment, your lack of a 401K or \u201cproperty,\u201d I\u2019d say these glazed shallots are the move. You toss them in a pan with some herbs and chile, butter and vinegar, and then they roast for a half hour\u2014AND you can make them ahead and microwave before dinner. But that\u2019s not enough food. These roasted carrots with a sweet-spicy sauce of harissa and maple syrup are super easy, and then your parents will be all, \u201cwhat\u2019s harissa? Can I get it at Kroger? Now what do I do with it?\u201d And you can pretend you know. Oh, and even if you don\u2019t make the glaze for these roasted brussels sprouts, this recipe technique gets them super crispy and delightful for people who grew up traumatized by TV-dinner mushy brussels.Not an ad for Tecate. Or is it?\nAlex Lau\u201cIs it appropriate to tell people exactly what to bring to a dinner party (like, \u2018natural wine only,\u2019 \u2018cheap beer only,\u2019 \u2018this specific salad recipe,\u2019 etc.) The answer to this is obviously yes but I still feel like it would make a good column.\u201d \u2014Emma W.Thanks for editorializing that question, Emma who may or may not work at Bon App\u00e9tit. I\u2019m a bossy lady and agree with you, but \u201cnatural wine only\u201d is TOO FAR. Do like our colleague Emily Schultz and tell your friends which wine stores you like so that they go there, hopefully. But asking for \u201cnatural wine\u201d is just too pretentious, like \u201conly wear socks with a high-thread count,\u201d or \u201conly bring plus ones I haven\u2019t already slept with.\u201d Some party details are out of your control. Things I\u2019ve asked guests to bring: Bounty paper towels, select-a-size. Vanilla ice cream. Negra Modelo (NOT Especial). Six limes. That book they borrowed three years ago and never read, clearly. Sometimes they accommodate, sometimes not. It\u2019s always worth a try!Meet the Boulevardier\u2014your winter Negroni.\nPhoto by Emily Schultz\u201cIs there an easy drink I can make with three ingredients that will replace a Negroni? I need a change.\u201d \u2014Greg L.BOULEVARDIER, DUDE. Or just make the negroni with Cynar instead of Campari. Or try my favorite cocktail in the world, the Adonis: 2 parts sherry, 1 part sweet vermouth (also known as SWEET V), and a dash of orange bitters. Stir and serve up, with an orange peel if you have it, lemon if you\u2019re roughing it.\u00a0That\u2019s all for now, but if you have petty etiquette questions or recipe requests for me, email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com and betoo specific. I want the juicy details!Love,\nAlexExplore Bon App\u00e9titThanksgivingEtiquetteholiday2018Is It Ever OkayRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
