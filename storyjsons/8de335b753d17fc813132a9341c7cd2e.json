It\u2019s been a surreal week, to say the least. I\u2019m here for work (no spoilers!), but I have to admit I\u2019m not not having a good time. I\u2019ve only been on two cruises in my life, both for work and both alongside Laura Murray, my stellar photographer and cruising companion. As I write this, Laura is floating in the ocean, stomach-down on a foam mat, attempting to snorkel without letting her freshly tattooed left calf get wet. It\u2019s going surprisingly well.I'm playing with a new newsletter format wherein there will occasionally be ~ categories ~ ! My systems-loving brain is excited. Let me know what you think.This Week on HealthyishCatch two of my favorites in conversation: Fariha Ro\u00eds\u00edn and Angela Dimayuga, for Fariha\u2019s new column, Who Is Wellness For? When she was only changing clothes for the sake of the pizza delivery guy, Akanksha Singh knew she had problems. Here\u2019s how she cooked her way out. Against all odds, chefs are bringing some personal fashion into the kitchen. How to find the perfect dinner candle.I Like YouI met Toyosi Oyelola when she recorded a podcast I did earlier this year. A senior at NYU, Toyosi already has an unmistakable style\u2014and a love of all things food. At the risk of sounding like a school principal, I can\u2019t wait to see what she does next.Make This TonightHealthyish has a muffin problem. As in: There are not enough muffins. Until this week, we had a single muffin recipe. Yes, it\u2019s delicious, but MORE MUFFINS PLEASE. Senior food editor Anna Stockwell to the rescue with these Apple and Oat Muffins, inspired by the bircher muesli she grew up eating for breakfast. (Muesli = overnight oats before overnight oats were cool.)The 5-Star ReviewI used to steal my (male) roommate\u2019s Devacurl shampoo back in 2010\u2014that\u2019s how long the curly-hair product line has been around. But it wasn\u2019t until a few weeks ago that I went to the Devacurl salon myself for a crash course in everything from scrunching technique to microfiber towels. Since then, the shampoo, conditioner, and styling creme have made my hair very happy.Reads of the WeekIn light of my current situation, I\u2019ve been re-reading all my favorite cruise stories: Caity Weaver on the Paula Deen cruise, Taffy Brodesser-Akner also on the Paula Deen cruise, and this little thing, of course. The legacy of the cruise ship story is strong\u2014right up there with road trip narratives and touring with the band\u2014and I feel lucky to be a bit player.Influence ThisLest we forget that we\u2019re being governed by an actual cartoon villain, the Trump administration is seeking to eliminate gender from civil rights protections, essentially erasing transgender people from government recognition. Very not okay. I\u2019m donating to The Trevor Project and Lambda Legal, but there are dozens of other groups who need help too.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish editorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletterRead MoreLifestyleLA Eats and Meal Prep FailsBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
