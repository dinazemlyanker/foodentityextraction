Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish readers,I admit I\u2019ve been lax on the whole cooking thing recently. Now that it\u2019s finally warm-ish in New York, I\u2019ve been out and about a lot more, which means \u201cdinner\u201d might entail an 11 p.m. sabich at Queen of Falafel, a heavy graze at a park barbecue, or a Japanese sweet potato smothered with peanut butter, eaten at my kitchen counter at some absurdly late hour.That\u2019s cool. I\u2019ve gone through this ebb and flow enough times to know I\u2019ll always come back to the kitchen, and luckily I have a job that\u2019s constantly tempting me there. Today I\u2019m eyeing Chris Morocco\u2019s recipe for perfectly seasoned sushi rice with miso-caramel glazed salmon. It\u2019s a dream recipe for people like me, who always wish their sushi came with more of that sweet, salty, sticky rice. I\u2019ve also sworn to make Andy Baraghani\u2019s asparagus stir-fry before it\u2019s too late, and Christina Chaey\u2019s spicy chicken lettuce wraps are the rare dish I could actually see myself throwing together after a long night out.Perfect fish, perfect rice.\nPhoto by Emma Fishman, Food Styling by Susie TheodorouI\u2019ve also been salivating over the June/July grilling issue. I don\u2019t have a grill these days, but I\u2019m collecting friends who do and plying them with bottles of p\u00e9t-nat in the hopes that they\u2019ll let me grill swordfish or soy-sauce flank steak or summer squash with feta or turmeric-mojo shrimp. I want to try these jalepe\u00f1o-marinated pork chops with the Superior Farms lamb chops I have in my freezer. And, on the side, I\u2019ll be converting all you honeydew haters with this nutty, gingery melon salad.I\u2019d love to claim that I have #dessertgoals too, like Claire Saffitz\u2019s cherry biscuit cobbler, but the truth is you\u2019re more likely to find me in line at the Mister Softee truck than rolling out biscuit dough. I\u2019ll get back in the kitchen soon, but I can only promise so much.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish EditorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletteressayRead Morecooking55 Healthy Grilling Recipes to Make This SummerGallery65 SlidesBy Ali FrancisRecipes you want to make.
