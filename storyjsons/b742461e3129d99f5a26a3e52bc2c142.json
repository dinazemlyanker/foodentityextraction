Well, the best chef\u2019s knife for YOU exists\u2014but the best chef\u2019s knife for everyone is impossible to name. Whether you\u2019re a home cook or a professional chef, choosing the best cutlery really comes down to your needs and personal preferences. In fact, when I pressed a few knife experts to recommend one knife for the title of Best Chef's Knife In All the Land, no one would do it. \u201cWhat works for you is not necessarily going to work for someone else,\" said Mari Sugai of Korin in New York City. \u201cYou don't have to go with whatever the internet says [editor's note: I gasped]\u2014chances are, you'll find something you like that will work for you.\u201dThe knife that is the best for you isn't the knife that's necessarily the best for your brother or cousin or next door neighbor. Before you shop, give a bit of thought to what kind of cook you are (rather than the kind of cook you want to be). \u201cThe most important thing I can tell people is to be introspective about how you cut,\u201d explained Jon Broida of Japanese Knife Imports in L.A. Ask yourself, are you an aggressive cook who loves to speed through tasks (as in, there's always a bit of garlic peel in the pile of not-so-finely chopped garlic on your cutting board), or are you meticulous and careful, plucking each and every tiny thyme leaf from even the littlest stalks? Even if the difference isn\u2019t that dramatic, think: Do you value speed or precision?Once you've taken a beat to self-reflect, consider the two major categories of knives available in the U.S.\u2014Western and Japanese-style\u2014and figure out which one best matches your personal style.Team Speed\nWhat are the characteristics of a Western-style knife?Sometimes simply called German knives, these double-bevel knives (meaning both sides are angled inward, meeting at the blade\u2019s edge) originated in Western Europe. The blades are thicker than those of Japanese knives, with more of a curved shape to facilitate a rocking motion. Most have the same angle on both sides, which makes them easier to sharpen (and that\u2019s advantageous, since you\u2019ll need to sharpen them often).Are they right for you? These are what Broida refers to as \u201cget shit done\u201d knives. They\u2019re made of a softer steel than Japanese knives, which makes them less brittle and more durable\u2014so you\u2019ll be able to accomplish nearly any kitchen task, from halving a kabocha to scoring pork belly to cracking open a watermelon.The caveats: They\u2019re heavier and less sharp than Japanese knives, and, because the steel is softer, they need to be sharpened more often.What about Japanese knives?There are traditional Japanese knives, which are mostly single bevel (one side is straight while the other is angled), made of carbon steel, and used by professional restaurant chefs\u2014and then there are the knives I\u2019ll be discussing here: Western-style Japanese knives. These are double bevel, made of material that\u2019s simpler to maintain, and versatile. Many have an asymmetrical edge (the edge is at a steeper angle on one side of the blade, i.e. 60:40 or 70:30), which contributes to sharpness. Two common shapes in the U.S. are the gyuto (chef\u2019s knife) and the shorter santoku knife.Are they right for you? If you value sharpness and precision and often spend hours chopping and slicing, you might gravitate towards a light Japanese-made knife. Compared to Western knives, the blades are thin, super sharp, and hard, meaning they hold their edge for longer (so you won\u2019t have to sharpen them as often). They excel at precision slicing.The caveats: Their hardness also makes them brittle, meaning they\u2019re more prone to chipping or snapping if used improperly. And because their edges can be asymmetrical, these knives can also take a bit more finesse to sharpen well.The choice between Japanese and Western knives isn\u2019t always so cut and dry, if you will, but that\u2019s a good thing: Many of the great knives blur the line between the categories\u2014sharp like Japanese, durable like Western. As Joanna Rosenberg of Zwilling told me, the advent of higher-quality steel, better finish, and innovative heat treatments means that knife makers are able to produce sharper knives that are more durable and stay sharp longer. \u201cThe good German knives are coming out sharper and the good Japanese knives are coming out with more durability, but they haven't met in the middle yet.\u201dThe easiest way to decide what you prefer is to take a trip to a store where they'll let you hold several different knives to see which feels best in your hand. If that's not possible, order from a site with a generous return policy and a big selection. The best chef's knife might not exist, but the best chef's knife for you is somewhere out there\u2014you've just got to find it. To help point you in the right direction, I polled Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s editors on their favorite chef\u2019s knives to use at home and in the BA Test Kitchen. See our top picks below.MAC Hollow Edge Chef Knife\u201cPound for pound, Mac knives (such as the 8\" scalloped chef's knife) are the best out there,\u201d says food director Chris Morocco. \u201cI\u2019ve used mine for years, and they hit the sweet spot in terms of being heavy and durable enough to take some kitchen abuse, but refined and precise enough that you will never need another kitchen knife again.\u201d Made with hard-but-not-brittle alloy steel, this one\u2019s a hybrid of Western and Japanese-style knives, which means it\u2019s strong but won\u2019t easily chip. It\u2019s got good heft and it\u2019s among the sharpest you\u2019ll find. Notice those little dimples across the knife\u2019s blade? They help the knife glide through sticky foods like potatoes, onions, and apples.Mac Knife Professional 8 Inch Hollow Edge Chef Knife$142 at AmazonGlobal Classic Chef\u2019s KnifeAssociate food editor Kendra Vaculin loves her collection of Global knives\u2014and you can find the chef\u2019s knife in both 8-inch and 6-inch variations. \u201cThey\u2019re lightweight and really do feel like an extension of your arm when you use them,\u201d she says. That\u2019s, in part, because they're so well-balanced: The hollow handle is full of an exact amount of sand added to offset the weight of the blade. If you want supreme stability while cutting and the ability to make super thin, delicate slices\u2014this is the knife for you.Global 8-inch Chef's Knife$109 at AmazonVictorinox Fibrox Pro Chef\u2019s KnifeA great chef\u2019s knife doesn\u2019t have to be an expensive knife. BA editors are big fans of the Swiss-made 8-inch Victorinox Fibrox Pro, which costs less than $50. It\u2019s the one that\u2019s stocked in the Test Kitchen\u2014and it\u2019s also associate food editor Zaynab Issa\u2019s favorite chef\u2019s knife of all time. It\u2019s a sharp knife with a stainless steel blade, and although it isn\u2019t full tang\u2014a.k.a. the blade doesn\u2019t extend all the way into the handle\u2014it\u2019s a solid knife that\u2019s easy to use, comfortable to hold, and sharpens nicely. It\u2019s a good chef\u2019s knife for both beginners and professionals, and Morocco says that it\u2019s one of the best knives for your money.Victorinox Fibrox Pro 8-Inch Chef's Knife$43 at AmazonMiyabi Chef's KnivesAssociate food editor Rachel Gurjar\u2019s favors this stunner from Miyabi. The blade is composed of 132 layers of MicroCarbide powdered steel, resulting in a stunning Damascus pattern, in which the blade is etched with various light- and dark-colored waves. \u201cI love that the wooden handle is straight, as opposed to curved,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd my hands are small, so I love how light this knife is.\u201d If you want an 8-inch chef\u2019s knife with peak precision (that\u2019s also a gorgeous work of art), this one is hard to beat.Miyabi 8-Inch Chef's Knife$330 at AmazonIf you\u2019re looking for Miyabi quality at a gentler price point, this is the knife I reach for when I'm planning on doing a lot of prep work and want to make very precise, clean slices. It merges Japanese craftsmanship with German engineering for a knife that\u2019s razor sharp, long-lasting, and corrosion resistant.Miyabi Evolution 8-Inch Chef's Knife$160 at Amazon$160 at Food52Bulat Chef KnifeComposed of 66 layers of \u201csoft\u201d stainless steel wrapped around a tougher, higher carbon core, the Bulat chef knife also boasts a beautiful Damascus finish. It\u2019s a high-quality knife that works wonders for everything from dicing veggies to cutting meat. \u201cI love my Bulat chef\u2019s knife,\u201d says cooking and SEO editor Joe Sevier. \u201cThe ergonomic olive wood handle is super comfortable (not to mention gorgeous) and the bolster is also ergonomic and makes detail work easier. Plus, the Damascus steel blade is well balanced and looks, ahem, sharp.\u201d Add this one to your knife set and you won\u2019t regret it.Bulat 8-Inch Chef Knife$125 at Anova$120 at BulatFive Two Chef\u2019s KnifeThis classic 8-inch chef\u2019s knife is made with carbon-infused Japanese steel and comes out of the box with a super sharp blade. As someone who is not the most diligent about knife-sharpening (even though I do know it's important), I appreciate how this knife seems to hold its cutting edge. It\u2019s lightweight enough that I buzz through piles of herbs without tiring out my wrists, but it's also sturdy enough that I don't fear hacking into a butternut squash or watermelon. It\u2019s a pretty knife but not a precious one.Five Two Essential Kitchen Knives$69 at Food52$48Takamura HSPS Gyuto 8.2\"\u201cI switched exclusively to Japanese chef\u2019s knives the minute I graduated culinary school because they're lighter, more ergonomic, and the blade tends to be thinner and more nimble,\u201d says food editor Shilpa Uskokovic. \u201cThis one holds its sharp edge really well, but when you do need to bring it back to a point, it just takes a few swipes on a whetstone.\u201d The Takamura knife brand is family-owned, and this knife\u2019s thin blade is made with a core of high-speed powdered steel for edge retention. It\u2019s a kitchen workhorse for all kinds of knife work: mincing vegetables, cutting meat (but never any bones\u2014use your cleaver for that), and removing the skin from fish. Uskokovic adds, \u201cThe color of the pakkawood handle is an understated but distinguished dark cherry, which adds to its charm. After almost a decade of daily dinners, my knife feels just as special and important to me as it did the first time I removed it from the box.\u201dTakamura HSPS Gyuto 8.2-Inch$180 at MTC KitchenOnce you\u2019ve found your perfect chef\u2019s knife, show it the respect worthy of a prized kitchen tool. Use a honing rod to align the edge of your blade and a knife sharpener\u2014ideally a whetstone\u2014to keep it gliding through onions like butter. And please\u2014hand wash only.Looking for the best bread knife? Step this way:The Best Bread Knife Costs $22 But Is Worth Its Weight In Gold.
