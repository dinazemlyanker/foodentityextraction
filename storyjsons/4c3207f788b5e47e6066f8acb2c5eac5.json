Case in Point: PavochonA mash-up of pavo for turkey and chon for lecho\u0301n, pavochon is the spice-lavished centerpiece of my family's Thanksgiving meal.By illyanna MaisonetOctober 28, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhotograph by Alex Lau, food styling by Susie Theodorou, prop styling by Sophie StrangioFacebookTwitterEmailMost everyone in our family had a key to Nana\u2019s house. But it was impossible to sneak in, even when the Sacramento sun was rising and the late November light was still soft\u2014robbin\u2019 hour. As soon as I\u2019d turn the key in the door and push it open a few inches, I could hear her penetrating campo intonation: \u201cilly?\u201d I\u2019d assure her it was me and listen as the melody of her coughs mingled with the creaking of her white enamel bed and then each stair step as she made her way down to the microscopic kitchen.There Nana would open the refrigerator door to reveal the turkey, already on its roasting throne. She\u2019d start her coffee, preheat the oven to 350 degrees (because that\u2019s the chosen Fahrenheit of our ancestors), and run the coffee through the colador I mistook for a sock my entire life. Then, when the kitchen felt as hot as being under a San Marcos blanket emblazoned with La Virgen de Guadalupe, she\u2019d send the turkey in and start on the dressing. (Who knows how Nana came up with this combination of buttery boxed cornbread mix and salty salami, but when placed on a fork with a piece of turkey and rich gravy, it\u2019s the perfect bite.) Soon the house would be full of people and the sounds of dominoes clicking, music tumba\u2019ing, bodies writhing, drinks flowing, and fists throwing.I\u2019m still not sure why Nana would wake at the crack of dawn, put the turkey in the oven, go back to bed, and take it out seven hours later. My mom was so used to turkey cooked within an inch of its life that when I went to culinary school and tweaked Nana\u2019s recipe, she was skeptical at my claims of doneness after just three hours. I grew up with the type of turkey I hear most people complain about: dry. But never flavorless. There\u2019s no such thing as bland in a Puerto Rican household.Pavochon, both the word and the dish, is one of Puerto Rico\u2019s many Spanglish creations. A mash-up of pavo for turkey and chon for lecho\u0301n, it\u2019s become the centerpiece of a Puerto Rican Thanksgiving. Come November, supermarket shelves across Puerto Rico hold all the classic components: cranberry sauce, stuffing, dinner rolls. The diaspora became accustomed to these items Stateside and brought them back to the island\u2014which could be how pavochon was born. Nana herself had never seen a turkey before she came to California; once here, she used the knowledge she had to season an unfamiliar bird, lavishing it with cumin, oregano, and garlic, just as she would our country\u2019s cherished spit-roasted pork dish.Because some people in the Puerto Rican countryside still have outdoor kitchens\u2014using wood-fueled fogo\u0301ns instead of ovens\u2014putting the turkey on a spit and slowly roasting it until golden seems like the obvious route. But looking through my massive collection of Puerto Rican cookbooks, I find no trace of the word pavochon\u2014or any turkey recipe at all\u2014until the late \u201990s, in the Cocina Desde Mi Pueblo companion cookbook from the popular Puerto Rican television series. What we do know is that turkey\u2019s introduction is definitely American, one of the few favorable things that came out of colonialism.Nana has been gone since 2015, and in her absence our extended family has ceased to exist. There aren\u2019t any more gatherings. There aren\u2019t any more conversations. For the past five Thanksgivings, I\u2019ve purchased a turkey from a local turkey farm and cooked it with my mom in her half-plex in Sacramento, a mile down the road from Nana\u2019s old house. This year, once again, it will be just the two of us, sheltering as a pod. I\u2019ll purchase the same turkey from the same turkey farm. Together we\u2019ll turn it into the same pavochon.Get the recipes:\u00a0PavochonPavochon, a mash-up of pavo for turkey and chon for lech\u00f3n, is the centerpiece of a Puerto Rican Thanksgiving.View RecipeCornbread and Salami DressingButtery cornbread and salty salami, when placed on a fork with a piece of turkey and rich gravy, is the perfect bite.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titThanksgivingTurkeyFirst PersonRecipes you want to make.
