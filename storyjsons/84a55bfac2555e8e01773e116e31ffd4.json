(You can find them at any supermarket with a butcher counter\u2014just ask! Or in a pinch, you can use skin-on, bone-in breasts and add 10 minutes to the indirect grilling time.) To cook, treat the grill like an oven, keeping the heat low and closing the lid. Even if you cook the chicken a touch too long, that skin is moisture insurance! After it has cooled, slice and dress the chicken in a nigella-spiked sauce. \u2014Rachel GurjarAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.
