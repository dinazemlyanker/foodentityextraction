Westbrook is focusing on the bottles that make him happy.By Derrick C. Westbrook, as told to Amy Tara KochJanuary 8, 2022FacebookTwitterEmailPhotograph by: Isa ZapataFacebookTwitterEmailWelcome to\u00a0The Pour, a monthly column about what we\u2019re drinking right now.Just before the pandemic I took over a bar and wine shop in Chicago\u2019s West Loop with two partners. Juice@1340 is what Chicagoans call a slashie: part bar, part shop. Buy something and take it home or drink it here. We\u2019re a neighborhood joint and definitely a stylish one. What we sell is a reflection of what we like.I rotate by-the-glass pours that reflect what I\u2019m currently excited about: an unexpectedly sweet Malbec, say, or a skin-contact Pinot Grigio. Typically, when you build a wine list, you\u2019re beholden to making the highest margin or finding wines with the broadest appeal. By-the-glass options give me freedom to be whimsical, unbound by the barriers of business.If distributors lead with the fact that a wine is Black-owned or woman-owned, I get annoyed. I don\u2019t want that to be the barometer. I didn\u2019t decide to sell Black-owned wines; I decided to sell really dope wines. The highest show of respect you can pay a wine is to judge it on the merits of yummy or nah. These five bottles fall into the yummy category\u2014and just so happen to come from Black winemakers.Brown Estate: \u201cChaos Theory\u201dThis earthy, dry blend from Napa Valley was the first Black-owned wine that reflected my palate and love for bold Napa reds.Maison Noir Wines: \u201cNew Noir\u201dBeverage director turned winemaker Andr\u00e9 Mack is the gold standard for sommeliers. His much-anticipated \u201cNew Noir\u201d takes skin-contact wine to another level.Bodkin Wine: \u201cCuv\u00e9e Agincourt\u201dThis wine was the first sparkling Sauvignon Blanc produced in the U.S. It\u2019s everything you\u2019d want from a dry sparkler.Michael Lavelle: \u201cIris\u201d Ros\u00e9This screams Black boy joy! Many think ros\u00e9 is just for the summer, but this one works year-round\u2014its acidity and brightness cut through hearty meals.Aslina Sauvignon BlancThis easy to drink gem from South Africa underscores simplicity as a pillar of quality.Disclosure: Andr\u00e9 Mack hosts a video series for Bon App\u00e9tit on YouTube.
