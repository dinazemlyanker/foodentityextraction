Bold extravagance has been replaced with a sense of minimalism that is all at the same time elegant. Think sleek forms balanced by smooth function, like the Delta Trinsic\u00ae Pro Kitchen Faucet.By Delta FaucetMarch 15, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailStreamline Your Kitchen AccessoriesAnna Cappelen and Chloe Pollack-Robbins, partners of the firm Curious Yellow Design, pride themselves on their style, which is influenced by the simplicity of classic Scandinavian design. A native Scandinavian, Cappelen translates this engrained aesthetic into the interiors she creates, even when shopping for simple details. Both designers agree that restraint is key when selecting all accessories, right down to the floral arrangements. \u201cYou may get excited by lavish bouquets,\u201d says Pollack-Robbins. \u201cBut keep it simple to be sure it\u2019s appropriate for the space.\u201d This translates to all aspects of living, especially in the kitchen--for example, your faucet should also reflect this idea of simplicity. A sleek appearance combined with highly advanced functionality, like found in the Delta Trinsic\u00ae Pro Kitchen Faucet with  Touch2O\u00ae Technology, is ideal for keeping things simple yet elegant in the kitchen.A Few, Simple Ingredients Are All You NeedWhen entertaining, or just staying in on a Tuesday night, Bon App\u00e9tit Contributing Editor Alison Roman agrees with the Curious Yellow team about simplicity. \u201cLess is more,\u201d she says. One of her go-to favorites is a simple and elegant pasta dish punctuated by many varieties of mushrooms. \u201cYou don\u2019t need 100 ingredients to make a delicious bowl of pasta,\u201d says Roman. \u201cThe addition of all different types of mushrooms enhances the texture, flavor, and color of the dish.\u201d Roman translates this love of simplicity to her workspace as well. A kitchen that is streamlined yet uber-functional is a must. Cooking can be messy, so any appliance or accessory that can help keep it simple is welcome. That\u2019s where, again, the right faucet comes in. \u201cIt is nice to use a faucet like Delta with  Touch2O\u00ae Technology,\u201d says Roman. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to reach for a handle if you have been cooking and your hands are dirty. It is a \u2018simple\u2019 idea that is extremely convenient and needed.\u201d\u201cWhether it is your florals, interior space, or kitchen, keep it clean, simple and elegant,\u201d recommends Pollack-Robbins.
