A tip we learned from the folks at Drifters Wife in Portland, Maine: A generous sprinkling of salt and a good massage renders the cabbage silky, yet still spunky.Ingredients 4 servings1head of Napa cabbage (about 2 lb.)\u00bccup pickled chile vinegar (from Pickled Hot Chiles)2Ruby Red grapefruit2Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling1cup mint leaves1Tbsp. Pickled Hot Chiles2Tbsp. Sesame SaltPreparationStep 1Cut cabbage in half lengthwise. Cut notch in base of each half to remove core; discard. Tear leaves into 2\" irregular pieces and place in a large bowl. Drizzle with vinegar and season with sea salt. Massage and scrunch cabbage firmly with your hands to soften and season leaves.Step 2Using a sharp knife, cut peel and white pith from grapefruit; discard. Cut grapefruit into quarters, then coarsely tear quarters into chunky pieces. Remove and discard any seeds or thick membranes. Add grapefruit to bowl with cabbage. Drizzle 2 Tbsp. oil over and toss to coat. Add mint and toss again.Step 3Transfer salad to a large platter.
