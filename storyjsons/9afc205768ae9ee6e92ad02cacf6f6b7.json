Next up: How to make instant mashed potatoes better\u2014this instant!My latest haiku:Mashed potatoes,I love you so much it hurts.(But I have no time.)Every week I lug home a big ol\u2019 bag of russet potatoes with the Very Good intentions of mashing them into creamy oblivion and covering a huge pile with a ladleful of stew and a dollop of sour cream. Rarely does that actually happen\u2014do yooouuuu want to spend an hour at the end of your workday peeling and scrubbing spuds?\u2014and what\u2019s left is a sack of scary-looking sprouted potato children that I\u2019m sure are plotting to poison me while I sleep.On busy nights, when I know mash from scratch isn\u2019t realistic, I\u2019ve been turning to instant mashed potatoes\u2014also known as instant potato flakes or mashed potato flakes\u2014instead. They\u2019re lightning fast to make (seriously, the prep time is like five minutes); super affordable (2 oz., which is about three servings, costs around 72 cents); and, with a couple of nifty tricks, you\u2019ll barely know they were born from a packet.When I called my whole-foods-only mother to alert her of this culinary update, I could hear the gears grinding in her head: What\u2019s wrong with real potatoes?! I, like Ma, had always assumed those little baggies contained none of the actual vegetable they were masquerading as. (In our defense, that potato dust looks a heck-load similar to fish food.) But we were both wrong. As it turns out, I told her, instant potatoes are just potatoes that have been cooked, mashed, and then dehydrated\u2014leaving you with crystallized, powdery flakes that you only need to rehydrate with hot liquid before serving. Seemingly convinced, Mom then asked: \u201cOkay, but how do the potatoes taste?\u201d My answer: That depends on what you do with them.Here\u2019s how to make instant mashed potatoes taste really good:Idahoan\u2019s classic mix was the best instant mash I tried. Still, my control batch, when prepared according to the directions on the packet\u2014with hot water, salt, and margarine or butter\u2014was lackluster. Gummy and a little bland, with a sort of musty, mothball flavor profile that just wouldn\u2019t quit. But after experimenting with a solid rotation of mix-ins (cream cheese, chives, milk, chicken broth, garlic powder, miso, Parmesan, and more), I finally landed on two winning combos that\u2019ll make any mashed tater shine.1. Beurre blanc instant mashed potatoesBright, creamy, aromatic, and flecked with wine-soaked shallots, this is the perfect side dish to a classic roast chicken. The game changers in this recipe are dry white wine and peppy lemon juice, which lend some much needed acidic brightness; a smattering of fresh herbs and shallots for added complexity; and butter, for, well, butteriness.Start by making the butter sauce: In a small saucepan or skillet, simmer \u00bd cup white wine (the cheap stuff is fine!) with 1 finely diced shallot or 1 Tbsp. dried onion flakes until only 2 Tbsp. of liquid remain. Add 6 Tbsp. chilled unsalted butter, stirring constantly until a glaze-like texture forms. Throw in 2 Tbsp. finely chopped tarragon or oregano and simmer for a few more minutes until the butter smells fragrant. Stir in the juice from \u00bc lemon and remove the pan from the stove. At this point, the sauce should be glossy enough to coat a spoon but not hollandaise-level-thick.Then, prepare the potatoes: Bring 1\u00bc cups water to boil in a small saucepan. Once bubbling away, remove from heat, add 1 cup instant mashed potatoes (2 oz.), and gently fluff with a fork. Pour the beurre blanc over the potatoes and stir to combine. If you simply cannot stand chunks in your smooth mash, feel free to strain the shallots and herbs out of your butter before uniting with the cooked potatoes. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.2. Miso-garlic instant mashed potatoesInspired by these beauties from Brad Leone, this is the super savory side piece your weeknight steak is lookin\u2019 for. The roasted garlic and yellow miso are the heavy hitters, bringing a burst of salty-umami to the otherwise kinda-bland spuds. And the cream takes the texture to new glossier heights.To start: Bring 3 cloves roasted and smashed garlic or 1 tsp. of the jarred stuff, 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, 2 Tbsp. yellow miso, and \u00bd tsp. cracked pepper to a boil in a small pot. As soon as the water is bubbling, take it off the heat. Give the liquid a good whisk (to meld the butter, garlic, and miso) and add 2 oz. instant mashed potatoes. Fluff gently with a fork. Bring \u00bc cup heavy whipping cream to a simmer in a saucepan, then pour it over the mashed potatoes. Stir to combine and season with salt (and more black pepper) to taste.Listen, real talk: At the end of the day, instant mashed potatoes are never going to be the same as their scratch-made siblings (less flavorful, curiously smooth). But as long as you expect them to be different, they can still be good. Use your leftover mashed potatoes to blanket a cozy shepherd\u2019s pie. Mix them with Parmesan and breadcrumbs to make golden fried croquettes. Or cover a mound in crispy, crushed chips for the ultimate carbohydrates mash-up.Whatever you do, just don\u2019t make eye contact with those sprouted creeps lurking in the dark recesses of your cupboard\u2014they\u2019re easily threatened.Explore Bon App\u00e9titcookingCheap TricksRecipes you want to make.
