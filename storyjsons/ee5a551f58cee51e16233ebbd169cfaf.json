Make sauerkraut? Become a hot sauce master? Here's what you'll need to get fermenting.By Alex DelanyJanuary 29, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailIf you've been watching our video series It's Alive with Brad, you know that we have a thing for fermented foods\u2014eating and drinking them, as well as experimenting with our own in the Test Kitchen. But you don't need a Test Kitchen to ferment at home. And you don't have to trek to some fancy Scandinavian restaurant to try your hand at fermented green garlic. You don't have to hit your local health store to explore the wonders of kombucha. You can produce that tangy, electric, exciting fermented flavor at home.Hot sauce. Sauerkraut. Pickles. Kombucha. Kimchi. They can all happen at home. But you'll need the right equipment. Thankfully, our  fermentation guru Brad Leone has a list of trusty tools to get you started. Here\u2019s his lineup:Cheese Cloth\u201cCheese cloth is a breathable fabric that also keeps unwanted bugs and contaminants out of your fermented treasures,\" said Leone, \"It\u2019s the perfect thing to fold and cover an open jar lid. Just seal it up with a rubber band. I use these all the time.\u201dUse It For: Covering any open jarsBuy It: $3.73 each at JetAuto Siphon\u201cThis is a sanitary way to get liquid from a large vessel to a smaller vessel. You know what I\u2019m talking about. Bottling. The smooth transfer isn\u2019t disruptive to the liquid, and you don\u2019t have to make a siphon with a tube and your mouth. I used to do that when bottling kombucha. That\u2019s not fun.\u201dUse It For: Bottling kombucha, tepache, or beerBuy It: $17 on AmazonBottle Brush\u201cGet those dirty bottle all the way out of here. You want a long brush that\u2019s able to properly clean the necks and corners of bottles. Scrub your shit good.\u201dBuy It: $12 (for a set) on AmazonCrock and Weights\u201cMost things are fermented in brine, a salty liquid that cures whatever goes into it. Think about sauerkraut, miso, or kimchi. You want to keep your product submerged in the brine, so it ferments evenly.\u201dUse It For: Making sauerkraut, kimchi, or misoBuy It: $60 (for both) on AmazonFermentation Kit\u201cThis kit is great for beginners. It includes lids and air locks for Mason jars, a vegetable pounder, and a book with recipes. If you want to start with small batches and buy everything in one swoop, look no further.\u201dBuy It: $55 on AmazonGlass Bottle\u201cFlip-top glass bottles are mandatory for fermented beverages. I used to use corked ones, but I\u2019ve learned better. These are easy to clean, reliable, and look pretty nice too. And always ferment in reusable vessels. The world\u2019s dirty enough as it is.\u201dUse It For: Bottling kombucha, tepache, or beerBuy It: $11 each at WalmartGallon Jar with Air Lock\u201cTwo cups of something? What am I going to do with two cups of something? If you\u2019re putting the time into fermenting, commit to a big batch. This one gallon jar comes with an air lock that promotes healthy fermentation and encourages large batches.\u201dUse It For: Sauerkraut, kimchi, and picklesBuy It: $19 (for two) at WalmartKombucha Starter Jar\"The Mother is the living force that makes kombucha tangy and funky, and you maintain it like bakers do a sourdough starter. While you can use just about any jar, I like the size of this one. It provides enough room for the mother to grow. Give the lady a comfortable home.\"Buy It: $20 (for two, comes with plastic airtight lid, muslin cloth, and rubber bands) on AmazonJacobsen Kosher Sea Salt\u201cA clean, high-quality salt is the secret to any good brine. Don\u2019t even think about touching the iodized stuff, which tastes like chemicals. If you start with high quality ingredients, you\u2019ll (hopefully) end up with a high quality product.\u201dUse It For: Sauerkraut, kimchi, corned beef, and picklesBuy It: $13 on AmazonThermapen\u201cYou should know what temperature your brine or fermented beverage is sitting at. The best fermentations happen at around 70\u00b0. I'll check in on kombucha to make sure it isn't too hot or too cool. If it is, I'll move it to a safer spot and thank my Thermapen.\"Buy It: $99 at ThermoworksThermoworks Digital Thermometer\u201cI\u2019m not a weatherman, but I like to know what my fermentation environment is looking like. Having a thermometer that reads the temperature and humidity in whatever room you're in will give you a better understanding of how the fermentation is going. Keep those numbers in your notebook for next time. It\u2019s science.\u201dBuy It: $39 at ThermoworksRefractometer\u201cThis is a little nerdy, but a refractometer uses light to identify the components and ingredient levels in solutions, which is super helpful for calculating the percentage of alcohol in a beverage. When I make tepache (a spicy, fermented pineapple drink), this comes in handy for reading sugar levels. It makes me feel like a scientist.\u201dUse It For: Measuring sugar and alcohol levels in tepache, kombucha, tepache, or beerBuy It: $22 on AmazonSaniclean\"Look, you have to keep things clean. I don\u2019t care what your room looks like at home. Your fermentation station should be spotless. Saniclean is an affordable, well-known, food-safe disinfectant made from a solution of two super-obscure acids. It\u2019s the industry standard, and giving your vessels a wash with a diluted solution of Star Sani and water will make sure all your fermented projects go according to plan.\u201dBuy It: 18 (for 16 oz.) on AmazonSpeaking of fermented hot sauce, that's something you should give a try:Fermented Hot Sauce Is Definitely Having a MomentLook what's bubbling up at restaurants around the country.View StoryExplore Bon App\u00e9titFermentationToolsShoppingRead MorecultureHere's What Happens When You Drink 2 Gallons of Kombucha a DayBy Bill Bradleycooking3 Cocktails That Prove Kombucha and Booze Are Made For Each OtherBy Alex DelanyLifestyleSauerkraut Is Getting the Love We Always Knew It DeservedBy Carly FishercookingJust Kimchi It: How to Turn Any Veg Into Addictive Spicy PicklesBy Amiel StanekRecipes you want to make.
