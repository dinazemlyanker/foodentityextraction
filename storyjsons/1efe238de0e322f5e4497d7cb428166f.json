We made the entire Lebanese dinner party for a pot luck and everything we had was incredible!! Really fun and interesting flavors! AnonymousPhilly7/8/2019I thought this recipe was amazing and would make again. I skipped the onion, parsley, lemon juice and sumac finish and served it instead with the sides from the same article: tomato salad with pine nuts and molasses and the cabbage tabbouleh (substituting farro for the bulgar). This would make a lovely summer barbecue dinner with a lot of the work ahead of time and just grilling at the last minute. Anonymous5/2/2019I liked the spices on this lamb but the yoghurt seemed to just get in the way, especially at grilling time when there was just a big mess all over my grill and the lamb didn't caramelize because of the excess moisture of the yoghurt. Next time I'm going to make a rub of the same spices and keep the yoghurt as a dressing for the parsley saladAnonymousCincinnati4/28/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titLebaneseMiddle EasternParsleyHerbs & SpicesLamb ChopLambMeatYogurtOther IngredientsMainNut-FreeGluten-FreeKetoGrillingFourth Of JulyMemorial DayLabor DayDinnerRecipes you want to make.
