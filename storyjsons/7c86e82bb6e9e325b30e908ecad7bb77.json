Prehistoric paper clips and soy sauce packets and keys from bygone apartments and little bags of baby teeth (EW!) were stashed and forgotten. Then, once we developed a written language, we gave it a name: The Junk Drawer.And here I am a thousand (or whatever) years later to say: Enough is enough! It\u2019s literally called a JUNK drawer. It\u2019s full of JUNK. It\u2019s a waste of SPACE. It doesn't matter whether you live in a shoebox apartment in New York or a suburban McMansion, ain't nobody got room for a drawer dedicated to useless things.The first step to ameliorating this desperate, depressing situation is to take stock of what is actually in this drawer. Open up! Do you see what I see? There are actually three categories of stuff in there:Actual garbage, like business cards, Ikea wrenches, and letters of disinheritance, which should be pitched or recycled immediately. Let! It! Go!Items that have another, more logical home. Stamps? Your desk drawer. Advil? The bathroom. Bloody knife? The river. Face it: These things ended up in The Junk Drawer because you were just too lazy to put them in their proper places. Shame!The true miscellany of life\u2014the things that actually deserve space in a catch-all drawer. Toothpicks, charging cords, extra-flammable birthday candles. Those should be organized in old iPhone box tops or cute bins (hat tip, Kondo!) and Tetrised in a satisfying way.Fancy toothpicks: Now THAT belongs in The Drawer. Takeout menus, not so much.\nDanny KimAt this point The Drawer needs a new name. Something that signals the organized, in-control life you now lead. How about: \u201cThe Drawer of Things Not Used Very Often.\u201d You think I\u2019m joking, but I seriously have a drawer with this exact name in my humble home. The name caught on. It took a few weeks, but then again, evolution takes time. And there\u2019s no going back.*Well, no, not really.This whole process will be much more bearable if you make a cocktail first:3 Campari Cocktails You Don't Need a Gazillion Ingredients to MakeHope you\u2019re thirsty!
