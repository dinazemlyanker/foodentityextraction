The custard came out perfectly.  I used cinnamon raisin challah bread and added a pinch of salt; amazing with the \"hint\" of orange.  SUPER EASY too!  My new \"go to\" bread pudding recipe.Anonymous12/19/2021I'd make this, but I just keep the eating the entire loaf of panettone myself! Oh well.AndyOttawa, ON10/22/2021This by far has got to be one of the best bread puddings that I've made.  Sooo tasty. Entire family ate every crumb.  Best of all, the sauce made it complete.  Easy to make.  2 thumbs up!  5 stars.\nJay R.Browns Mills, NJ2/16/2021I\u2019d give this recipe a 4.5 if I could. The pudding itself is exactly what I\u2019d hoped it would be \u2014 it puffed up a bit at the end of baking. It was sweet, but not so much that the other flavors were lost.\nInstead of the yogurt sauce, I found a creamy rum sauce that is a much better flavor contrast (I think amaretto would be good too).JaneSt. Louis MO12/24/2020Good recipe, use panettone with dried fruits and be sure to cook it enough milomanLos Angeles 1/24/2020Great recipe! Don't skip the yogurt topping. It's an awesome topping.AnonymousGrand Rapids, MI1/3/2020Needed to come up with a dessert for christmas! This Panettone bread pudding recipe was the best decision I made. Was easier to make than expect and the end result was DELICIOUSFlowerboyFrance12/29/2019Delish! And SO easy! Made this twice now, the second time for a Christmas Eve party. My dish was a little on the small side (filled to the top only 2 quarts) but with some work it fit just fine, and after baking the bread deflates a bit. The maple yogurt is fantastic here. After an hour in the oven the bread pudding was still not quite \"dry\" everywhere, but once taken out and allowed to cool it was fine. Was a hit at the party and I'll definitely be making it next year.Anonymous12/26/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titBreadDessertItalian AmericanAmericanBakingChristmasBreakfastBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
