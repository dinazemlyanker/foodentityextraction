Take advantage of all of the options (wherever it says \u201cand/or\u201d you can use either ingredient listed\u2014or both). And if you want to take the easiest path, simply sub 2\u00bd cups muesli for all the seeds and the oats!

I barely leave them in the oven for the 14 minutes, otherwise, I find they're a little too crunchyJade VandergriftWashington3/10/2022Used a higher gluten flour (similar to bread) and mine didn't run.  Didn't have the polenta/quinoa so did an ancient grain (granola/muesli like stuff) instead.  Also added 1/3 up of dry bing cherries to avoid the 'cat litter' texture of all the seeds/grains (and would do dried fruit again).  Finally, I had almond meal so I used that instead of the 1/3 cup wheat flour.  Think this really improved the texture to be more like a traditional cookie.  As suggested, baked at 400 for 16 mins.   I'm not at all sure how much healthily\"er\" these really are, but I think I will sub some low glycemic sugar for the 1/2 cup granulated sugar next time.  San Francisco, California10/14/2020Great cookies that felt a little healthier than typical chocolate chip cookies. Haven\u2019t baked them yet, and probably won\u2019t... the dough is great. Ashley AstolfiBrooklyn, NY4/14/2020I think these cookies are delicious--like gritty chocolate chip cookes! I substituted 1/2 cup bread flour for 1/2 cup of the all-purpose flour and my cookies did not spread at all.  Beautiful!AnonymousKalamazoo, MI3/26/2020If using quinoa, should it be cooked first, or used raw? Thanks!Anonymous10/3/2019I made this-Multigrain cookie is a nutritious and healthy cookie made using different flours.\nI used dark nine multi-grains such as oats, corn, whole wheat, sunflower seeds, flax seeds, sesame seeds, ragi, rice and almond, for a healthy yet tasty snack.\nI have bought same cookies in \"CAFENILOUFER\" HyderabadsainathHyderabad7/12/2019These turned out pretty tasty though they spread so much in the oven, even with the hours of chilling.  I like how there's lots of room for interpretation in the recipe.  I think next time I'll also add dried cherries or cranberries for a little more moisture and the texture would go well with the chewiness.  AnonymousChicago, IL10/15/2018These are great. I used dark chocolate chips and used slightly less (a personal prefernce). I suggest making them slightly smaller, they spread a lot in the oven despite three hours of chilling. I also liked them better on the slightly less done side of 14 minutes rather than 18. They have a great chewy texture that way.AnonymousAstoria, NY10/3/2018I made this and doubled the chocolate- turned out great. I brought them on a camping trip and my buddy didn't appreciate the varied texture and called them, \"cat liter cookies.\" \ud83d\ude02 Hayden90Tulsa, OK10/3/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titCookieDessertAmericanOatRice & GrainsQuinoaChocolateOther IngredientsMolassesCondiments, Sauces & PastesWhole Wheat FlourFlourFlaxseedSeedVegetarianHealthyishBakingRecipes you want to make.
