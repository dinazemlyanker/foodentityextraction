It\u2019s got a tiled name-plate pizza oven, a tiny bar, and about five tables jammed into an itty-bitty space. It offers remarkable charcuterie (including prosciutto, which my father insists on pronouncing \u201cbra-shoot\u201d), bomb-ass old-timey pasta, and too-bright bathrooms too close to the kitchen with one-ply toilet paper and antiseptic pink soap. Riccardo\u2019s empire spans across the street to the fancier yellow-bathed Riccardo Trattoria, but we are simple people, and we like wearing athletic leggings and crewnecks to dinner.Spirits, are you there?\nPhoto by Jeff MariniUntil a few months ago, I was ignorant of the fact that Riccardo Enoteca also stands on the site of the infamous prohibition-era St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre of 1929, wherein seven men associated with Bugs Moran\u2019s gang were gunned down in what was then a parking garage, likely by Al Capone\u2019s associates. People say the restaurant\u2019s haunted.I\u2019ve never been visited by their ghosts, even though I\u2019m a joy to spend a dinner with. But it makes sense that seven sets of invisible hands would get to work each evening\u2014winding up the pasta maker and the meat shaver, stoking the pizza coals, and refilling red-pepper shakers, marveling over a completely legal wine and beer menu\u2014arranging everything just to remind us that those unrelenting Chicago winters will eventually end, and sometimes, forever and without notice. While you\u2019re here, they seem to tell us, you might as well enjoy the dim lighting and the mahogany bar and the complimentary bruschetta.Claire Carusillo is a writer living in New York.
