Very light and refreshing. Evan C Bham, AL 1/14/2022This salad was absolutely phenomenal! I added pomegranate seeds on top and it was a CLUTCH move. Also, I\u2019m a chronic over-garlicker, but today chose to follow directions and one clove gives the perfect amount of bite. No more, no less. And again I say, if you\u2019ve got pomegranate seeds, add them!!Kaitlyn FarrisChillicothe, IL10/31/2021Refreshing salad that I usually make during fall and Christmas holidays. I usually toss in some crumbled bacon  and mandarinr orange slices as well. Serve with herbal tea while the main course is cooking.Most refreshing salad Rochester Minnesota 11/26/2020I would make this again in a heartbeat! Usually not a big fan of fennel, but this recipe changed my mind. I substituted walnuts for pecans and used dried mint in the dressings instead of fresh mint. Overall, amazing!!AnonymousOttawa, Canada10/4/2020Loved this! I've made this a few times adjusting with what I had in the house, including subbing the walnuts for pistachios (YUM, but toast in pan rather than oven), subbing coriander for mint (also great) and adding some smokey bacon (can highly recommend, pork and fennel are a winning combo)Emma JonesCape Town, South Africa8/5/2020Really easy to make and delicious. Will definitely be making again. AnonymousBrooklyn, NY6/17/2020So delicious! Used what was in the house so ended up subbing almonds for walnuts and basil for mint.
