It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Oh be-haveWho\u2019s that over there, sticking her toothpick in bite after bite of peach samples at the farmers\u2019 market? Not you, because you know the rules\u2014one sample per varietal! This caused a rift in my household, where someone named Bill thinks samples are unlimited and plentiful to all who are snackish. But he\u2019s used to being wrong!

But I appreciated the throwback to scalloped potatoes, which we ate once a week when I was a kid. (My body is 63 percent heavy cream.) Now I\u2019ve moved on to crispier fronts: Hello, potato nugs.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Peden & MunkFava foreverI went to the trouble of cooking with buttery fava beans for the first time in my LIFE this week\u2014shelling them from the pod, blanching, peeling the bean from the thick bean skin. By the time they were peeled (mangled, really), I was too lazy to make a vinaigrette or do anything else, so I melted butter and ate the beans right there at the counter, with lemon and salt. If you see high maintenance fava beans at a restaurant, ORDER THEM.Get (a) recipe: Flatbread with Fava Beans, Cucumbers, and BurrataIn a bookI just finished reading Jennifer Weiner\u2019s Mrs. Everything. The book\u2019s about two sisters\u2019 diverging paths, beginning in the 1950s in Detroit and through the following decades. Lots of stuff about figuring out what you want in life, what you need, domestic burdens and joys, and facing difficult truths. (Vague enough?) The main character also subscribes to ye olde Bon App\u00e9tit, so that\u2019s fun. I\u2019ll go ahead and claim it right now for having the best food scene in fiction this year. There\u2019s a Thanksgiving dinner that captures all of the emotional stressors of that holiday, and how we bury them in stuffing and cranberry sauce. Until we can\u2019t any longer. \ud83d\udca5Photo by Chelsie CraigIt\u2019s the pitsIt\u2019s cherry season and I have a fondness for sour cherries, the best to use when baking. (My beloved clafoutis!) But say you don\u2019t feel like baking. I had a pint of cherries that were too sour to snack on, so I threw them in a saucepan with a lemon peel and some sugar, cooked them down for eight minutes, and blammo, jam. However, I couldn\u2019t have done it without my trusty $8 OXO cherry pitter, pulled from my Ziploc bag of \u201ctools not used very often.\u201d But right now, it\u2019s in the cutlery drawer, READY FOR ACTION.The next big appleIn California Sunday, an in-depth look at the making of (and million-dollar marketing of) the next big apple\u2014the Cosmic Crisp. But I have a lot of questions about the WA 2.Unnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekSarah Jampel didn\u2019t know what she was wading into when she asked our Slack group, \u201cwhat is the best muffin recipe?\u201d Muffins, which Molly Baz calls \u201cmediocre small cakes,\u201d don\u2019t usually make it to the top of the development pile in the Test Kitchen. \u201cThey\u2019re sad,\u201d said Adam Rapoport, who referenced \u201cyour average commuter muffin carb bomb\u201d\u2014something that brings sustenance, not pleasure. Carla Lalli Music, taking a break from filming [REDACTED] with muffin-maligning Molly, complained \u201cthey\u2019re somehow wet and dry at the same time!\u201d \u201cBut you know what,\u201d Molly replied, \u201ca morning glory muffin, sliced in half, with butter, griddled until crispy on one side\u2014that\u2019s how I want my muffin.\u201d Nodding, Carla approved of this method, but make it a corn muff. By the elevators, I ran into Sarah Jampel and a frowning Andy Baraghani and watched as Sarah, by the power of description, convinced Andy that a muffin can be great: \u201cIf it\u2019s baked right, it has a fluffy, not cakey, inside, and a very crunchy top.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s RARE,\u201d conceded Andy, who\u2019s more of a scone guy. Anna Stockwell feels a muffin should meet it\u2019s expectation of being a breakfast food: \u201cwhole grains, nuts and fruits, almond flour\u2026\u201d Sounds familiar. Speaking of Healthyish, Amanda Shapiro loves a bran muffin. Jesse Sparks and Aliza Abarbanel are on team \u201csome muffins are okay.\u201d But Emily Schultz stands firm: \u201cIf I\u2019m going to eat a breakfast pastry, it\u2019s gonna be a croissant.\u201d Same.Get the recipes:Extra-Corny Cornbread MuffinsGluten-Free Apple and Oat MuffinsExplore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecookingThese Extra-Corny Cornbread Muffins Are No JokeBy Jesse SparkscookingHow Interesting That This Tomato Galette Could Serve 8...or 1By Alex BeggscultureA Summer Mood BoardBy Alex BeggscultureThe Best Etsy Stores for Hunting Vintage PyrexBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
