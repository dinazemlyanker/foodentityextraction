Yep, we're obsessed with probiotics, microorganisms that help rebalance the gut flora and support healthy gastrointestinal and immune functions. But more and more we're hearing about prebiotics, another thing we supposedly need to keep our guts\u2014and just about everything else\u2014up to par.Okay, but what are prebiotics?The difference between prebiotics and probiotics comes down to more than just a delinquent vowel. \u201cPrebiotics are indigestible fibers that bypass your small intestine and head to your colon where they are fermented by the bacteria in your gut,\u201d says Dr. Vincent Pedre, author of Happy Gut. Prebiotics occur naturally in foods like avocados, whole grains, and alliums like garlic and leeks, or you can buy prebiotic supplements. Look for capsules or powders that contain dietary fibers like inulin or FOS, which stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria like Bifidobacteria.How do they make me healthier?\u201cWhen prebiotics are fermented, they produce short-chain fatty acids like butyrate that help keep the colon healthy, maintain blood sugar balance, and even affect brain neuroplasticity,\u201d says Dr. Pedre.  In other words, prebiotics are the fuel that probiotics use to regulate a well-functioning gut. As a dietary fiber, they help the microorganisms in our intestines grow, and they\u2019re often taken to maximize a probiotic\u2019s benefits.  You don't need to take a prebiotic for probiotics to work, but it can give the live bacteria a boost.Prebiotics can also help with common digestive issues like bloating and constipation, increase mineral bioavailability, and even promote satiety and weight loss. Some studies even posit that prebiotics can be beneficial for stress-related behaviors.  The benefits of prebiotics aren\u2019t limited to humans\u2014they\u2019re also given to calves, poultry, and even farmed fish to increase growth and reduce the rate of respiratory and gut disease.Wooden Spoon's prebiotic powder uses herbs like burdock and elecampane.\nPhoto by Alex LauHow should I get my prebiotic fix?Prebiotics are filling up supplement shelves, but perhaps the best way to get them is through food like avocados, whole grains, and alliums. \u201cIf you're eating a wide variety of foods and spices, including scallions, leeks, and garlic, you should be able to get enough prebiotic foods in your diet,\u201d says Dr. Pedre. \u201cHowever, if you are sick with gut issues, then you will very likely need prebiotics to help rebuild your gut flora.\u201d Prebiotic supplements range from capsules, which commonly include probiotics as well, to plant-based prebiotic powders.What are prebiotics doing in skincare?Our body\u2019s microbiome is everywhere, so it\u2019s no surprise that prebiotics are entering the world of skincare too. Cult French skincare line Orveda, whose vegan products harness the power of everything from kombucha to fermented marine enzymes, recently released a \u201cprebiotic emulsion\u201d fortified with Alpha-glucan Oligosaccharide. On the lower end of the price spectrum, La Roche-Posay offers a moisturizer containing \u201cprebiotic thermal water.\u201d These types of skincare products use prebiotics and probiotics to improve skin's surface protection, promoting smooth and heathy-looking skin.Is it possible to get too many prebiotics?Actually, yes. \u201cThis is one example where too much of a good thing may actually be too much,\u201d says Dr. Pedre. \u201cIf you take too many prebiotics in the form of supplements (like resistant starch, for example), then you will very likely get bloated, gassy, and uncomfortable with abdominal pain. So, when incorporating prebiotics as a supplement, start low and go slow.\u201d While prebiotics and probiotics are generally safe to consume, it\u2019s best to speak with a medical professional, especially if you plan to take prebiotic supplements on their own.Let's get to the recipesIf you want to up your prebiotic consumption, perhaps the safest way to start is through eating more prebiotic foods. Luckily there are tons of options, including but not limited to avocado toast. Try hot-pink pearl onion pickles, blistered asparagus with peanut-coconut sprinkle, or an infinitely riffable batch of overnight oats, to support your body's microbiome in an effective (and undeniably delicious) way.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishProbioticsTrendsRead MoreLifestyleWhat\u2019s the Deal with Probiotics and Which Ones Should I Take?By Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
