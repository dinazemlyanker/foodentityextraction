You won\u2019t find me tossing away my synthetic acids, but I can get down with clean moisturizers and organic shampoos\u2014so long as they work. What\u2019s held me up in the past with natural deodorants, though, is that my sweat glands are perpetually on turbo. I walk around looking like the Coast Guard just pulled me out of the East River, and even in the winter, I get damp if my winter coat is too damn cozy. Forget sweater weather. It\u2019s sweat weather for me, and it\u2019s a year-round phenomenon.The thing is, natural deodorants don\u2019t really impress me. They\u2019re old news compared to clay masks that change color and Biologique Recherche P50 dupes. I would need a natural deodorant to be able to mop my floors for me to give it a second look, or for Beyonc\u00e9 to give it a whole-hearted endorsement for free. So when Myro, the newest natural deodorant on the market, hit the scene with a 16,000-person waitlist, I was intrigued. Like...why? You know y\u2019all can get natural deodorants at upstate New York drugstores now, right?Myro deodorant comes in colorful cases like blush, moss, and royal blue.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigAnd natural deodorants, as good and wholesome as they may be, are not antiperspirants. That was one of the first things Greg Laptevsky, the founder of Myro, told me. While a deodorant nixes odor, antiperspirants reduce sweating. And the only antiperspirant approved by the FDA is aluminum, he explains. (The rise of natural deodorants stemmed from the claim, since debunked by the American Cancer Society, that aluminum is linked to breast cancer.) Instead, barley powder in the deodorant absorbs moisture.But I wasn\u2019t trying this just for its sweat-reducing power. I was doing it because it\u2019s also cute. Everything about it is cute, from the sculptural packaging to the soft colors\u2014including millennial pink, which is what I use because I am drops voice to a whisper a millennial\u2014to the five scents, which are floral and bright and so appealing that I couldn\u2019t pick a favorite. Plus, they\u2019re refillable\u2014good for the environment and my budget\u2014and small enough to keep in your bag for touch-ups. The brand\u2019s hashtag, #bettervibesdaily, has 182 tags and counting. That doesn\u2019t sound all that impressive until you remember that it\u2019s a deodorant. People are Instagramming their deodorant.Anyway, I popped a pod in the Chill Wave scent (a combination of cucumber, jasmine, and spearmint) into my pink case and swiped it on. My first thought was that it didn\u2019t sting my underarms the way other natural deodorants I\u2019ve tried have. The creamy texture also doesn\u2019t transfer onto my clothing, which was an unexpected bonus.On my hour-long walk, I started to sweat with abandon. I couldn\u2019t really fault Myro for this one: They\u2019re not selling themselves as an antiperspirant, anyway, and there\u2019s likely not enough barley powder in all the world to handle my sweat glands. Once I take my coat off and air myself out, I do a sniff test, to the delight of everyone in the coffee shop. I no longer smell quite like Chill Wave, but it\u2019s still floral and warm\u2014and not anywhere like the funk I\u2019d be experiencing without any deodorant at all.Hot yoga takes it down within minutes, though I saw that coming. It\u2019s wildly distracting to feel sweat streaming down my arms during pyramid pose. But it holds up surprisingly well when I go for a run in chilly weather. I don\u2019t even sweat too much, thanks to the windchill, and when I get back, I smell mostly the fabric softener from my t-shirt and faint floral notes.I\u2019ve been using it for a few weeks now, and while I miss antiperspirant for the sake of my t-shirts, I\u2019m impressed by how well Myro manages to hold back my signature stank. Despite the sweat, I never actually smell bad. And while I won\u2019t pose with it on my Instagram, I\u2019ll keep using it\u2014and sub in the antiperspirant for hot yoga. It\u2019s all about balance.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishNatural BeautyTrendsRead MoreLifestyleThis Color-Changing Vitamin C Mask Is More Than Just Instagram BaitBy Deanna PaiRecipes you want to make.
