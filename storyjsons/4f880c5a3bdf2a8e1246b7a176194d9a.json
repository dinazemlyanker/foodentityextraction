Here I make it even beachier with fresh citrus juice, a little bit of red pepper jelly heat and a generous pour of crisp Mexican-style lager. When it comes to the beer, I\u2019m all about Victoria or Pacifico, but I\u2019ll let you go with whatever brand you like, just as long as it\u2019s light and takes you straight to the cabana.\u201d If you really can\u2019t take the heat (it\u2019s not a lot!), you can substitute whatever marmalade or jam you\u2019d like for the pepper jelly.IngredientsMakes 1\u00beoz. fresh grapefruit juice\u00beoz. fresh lime juice\u00bdoz. agave nectar2Tbsp. red pepper jelly1\u00bdoz. tequila blanco112-oz. chilled Mexican beerLime wedge (for serving)PreparationCombine grapefruit juice, lime juice, agave, and jelly in a cocktail shaker filled with ice and shake until incorporated, 15\u201320 seconds.

As another commenter mentioned, this is better with 2 tsp of jelly, not 2 Tbsp. I used a green chile jam from a local farm, but a jalape\u00f1o jelly or similar would taste good as well. For a superior balance with the jelly, trying subbing mezcal for tequila blanco.KitDenver, CO3/14/2022Too sweet for me, but my partner loved it as is. I knocked the pepper jelly (someone gifted us very mild jar with a lot of sugar) and agave nectar down as well as a little less tequila - very refreshing. I'd suggest making a test cocktail and adapting it a little to one's taste. Mason SYreka, CA6/5/2021Used fresh squeeze juice and this was quite sour. Double the agave and still was less refreshing and more tolerable for one. Next time would pass over in favor of a Micheleda.
