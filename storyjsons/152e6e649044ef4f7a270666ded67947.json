Pre-chill the glasses. Try a sprinkle of salt. When in doubt, citrus. But my best trick comes in a bottle, and it\u2019s this simple syrup from Royal Rose.Royal Rose is a small-batch company in Newcastle, Maine, that specializes in simple syrups made from local ingredients like blueberry and more unusual blends, like lavender and lemon. The whole lineup is commendable and recommendable, but the saffron syrup is my ride-or-die because of its subtlety. With only a few ingredients\u2014unbleached sugar, saffron, lime juice, and cinnamon\u2014the syrup makes almost any drink taste better and more complex...meanwhile, no one drinking will ever guess why.I\u2019ve found that the earthy, just slightly floral syrup pairs well with any base spirit. It\u2019s also delicious stirred into fresh lemonade or plain yogurt, or drizzled over pizza or hard cheese. Once open, it\u2019ll keep for months in the fridge, but if you're anything like me, you'll go through your bottle much faster than that.Buy it: Royal Rose Saffron Simple Syrup, $17All products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
