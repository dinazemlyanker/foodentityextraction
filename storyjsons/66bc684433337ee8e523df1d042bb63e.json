And while this wouldn\u2019t be wrong, making one takes about as much effort as cracking open a beer. A shandy, loosely defined as beer poured over ice and topped with a tart-sweet mixer, is a gloriously unfussy drink.It\u2019s all about honoring the tenets of summer, which include consuming alcohol and quenching thirst\u2014ideally simultaneously. If the thought of drinking beer on ice horrifies you, lest the dilution degrade the integrity of the brew or whatever, know that I\u2018m talking about using the cheap stuff, not some hopped-up IPA or chocolaty stout.The shandy is especially friendly for hot-weather gatherings that last well into the evening since it\u2019s the kind of low-ABV all-day sipper that keeps you in check (and, uh, hydrated?). I recommend staying away from hard alcohol while the sun's out\u2014daytime drinking is a marathon, not a sprint.Bonus points if you add a paper umbrella.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiMaking shandies for a crowd requires almost nothing on your part. The ingredients are store-bought, the drink is built right in a cup (no pitchers needed), and people can make their own, regardless of skill level.Here\u2019s how it\u2019s done: Just fill a tall glass of ice two-thirds of the way with the inexpensive beer of your choice (I\u2019m a Tecate woman), then top with any number of refreshing drinks such as Ting, lemonade, or kombucha to taste. And although this low-key drink is antithetical to garnish of any sort, I wouldn\u2019t say no to one of those cute paper umbrellas.You know what goes well with beer?
