Clean and lightly oil grate. Grill peppers over hottest part of grill, turning occasionally, until skins are blackened and blistered all over, 15\u201320 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let cool.Step 2While the bell peppers cool, mix paprika, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl, then toss chicken pieces in spice mixture to coat. Arrange chicken pieces, skin side down, over hottest part of grill and grill, turning halfway through, until lightly charred, 5\u201310 minutes. Move chicken to cooler part of grill, cover with lid, and continue to grill, turning several times (keep covered), until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 160\u00b0 for breasts and 155\u00b0 for thighs and drumsticks, 15\u201325 minutes longer (the chicken temperature will increase about 5\u00b0 as it rests). Transfer chicken pieces to a rimmed baking sheet as they are done (smaller pieces will go more quickly) and let cool.Step 3Remove skins and seeds from bell peppers; discard. Tear flesh into about 2\"-wide strips. Toss in a clean large bowl with Master Vegetable Marinade and oregano and let sit at room temperature at least 1 hour.Step 4Toss chicken and marinated bell peppers (minus juices in bowl) together on a platter. Pour juices over chicken. Serve with Lemony Yogurt Sauce and/or Grilled Serrano Salsa Verde alongside.Step 5Do Ahead: Chicken can be grilled and bell peppers can be marinated 1 day ahead. Cover and chill separately. About 1 hour before serving, remove chicken and bell peppers from the fridge and let sit at room temperature to warm up a bit.How would you rate Cold Paprika-Grilled Chicken with Marinated Bell Peppers?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkExplore Bon App\u00e9titBell PepperVegetablePaprikaHerbs & SpicesChickenPoultrySummerEasyMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreeHealthyishGrillingDinnerRecipes you want to make.
