It wasn\u2019t until their lipstick won a beauty award from the magazine where I was moonlighting that I first tried it for myself. I saw why it won: The color was subtle yet flattering, the texture buttery, the finish satin-like.So when Kosas, the brainchild of artist and chemist Sheena Yaitanes, debuted a tinted skin oil\u2014the brand\u2019s interpretation of foundation\u2014I was torn. I wanted to try it, but I tend to shy from oils because my forehead looks like a fracking accident no matter how much mattifying primer or blotting sheets I use. I was also finally recovering from a months-long breakout so inflamed that it warranted antibiotics, so I did not exactly want to poke the metaphorical bear by dumping more oil on my skin.But this oil isn\u2019t the kind that\u2019ll sit the surface of your skin and send you to the office bathroom to snuff out your human headlamp with squares of one-ply toilet paper. Instead, it sinks in. \u201cThe oil delivers nutrients to your skin, absorbing deeply and leaving a thin pigment layer behind,\u201d explains Yaitanes. She hand-picked each one based on their benefits: Avocado oil hydrates and cushions skin, she says, while green tea seed oil fights free radicals, jojoba oil balances skin, and rosehip seed oil brightens and clarifies.Convinced, I decided to go for it, choosing Shade 5 from the line. There are only 10 shades total, which seems risky in a world with Fenty Beauty, but there\u2019s a reason for it: Yaitanes says she formulated the shades to be sheer enough for your own skin tone to come through, so a single shade can work across three different skin tones and a variety of undertones.At this, my BS detector began to heat up. Being Chinese and Italian, my skin tone is tan and olive-ish, and maybe a little peachy depending on the light. Trying to match my foundation is a process as drawn-out and torturous as last season of The Bachelor. Truly: I once stood at a beauty event and swatched a third of their 30-plus shades only to learn that they didn\u2019t offer a single option for a medium-toned biracial girl.But Shade 5, which I\u2019d picked via that scientific method of holding my hand up against a swatch on my dirty laptop screen, somehow disappeared into my complexion as I smoothed it on. (Using your fingers in a sweeping and pressing motion is the best way to apply it, says Yaitanes.) It was like witchcraft. I started with a few drops, since the formula, which feels like a dry oil with pigment, is so concentrated. While the first application wasn\u2019t enough to cover some lingering dark spots, I added another layer. That did the trick. The color was perfect.The second day I tried it, it began to pill, though I can\u2019t blame the oil for that one. \u201cSerums or skincare containing silicones may cause pilling,\u201d says Yaitanes, as the tinted face oil is silicone-free. And indeed, I\u2019d just slathered on my sunscreen without giving it a chance to sink in. Worth noting, too, is that because the oil lacks silicone\u2019s signature slip, \u201cour formula may cling to dry patches,\u201d Yaitanes explains. \u201cSo make sure that you exfoliate on a regular basis, especially during the drier months.\u201d At least that\u2019s not a problem for me.Once I began waiting a minute or two after applying my sunscreen, the oil was virtually undetectable. And it stayed that way throughout the day. There wasn\u2019t an oil slick to be found.That\u2019s by design. \u201cIt works for your skin while it\u2019s on, wears better and better throughout the day, and when you remove it, your skin underneath looks nourished and strong,\u201d she says. And by the time I got home and washed my face, I saw that she was right.Buy it: Kosas Tinted Face Oil, $42.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
