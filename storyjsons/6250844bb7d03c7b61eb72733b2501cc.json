He shares recipes he\u2019s been cooking, restaurants he\u2019s been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you\u2019ll get this letter before everyone else.Let\u2019s forget about ribs and rib eyes.This is the summer I grill something different.Maybe you can relate.I\u2019ve always thought of grilling less as a means of cooking, and more as a set roster of dishes. For big gatherings, I fire up my \u201cfamous\u201d ribs, and everyone asks how they get so crispy, while remaining fall-apart tender. (Hint: Slow-cook in the oven, then shellack with sauce over a live fire.)For good friends, I splurge on a dry-aged rib eye and I then brag about the deeply seared, perfectly medium-rare finished product like a dad talks proudly about his child. Except I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m guilty of sharing photos of my rib eyes even more often than I do of my 10-year-old son.How do I break out of my routine when, like many of us, it\u2019s so easy to fall back on what works?Best-Ever Barbecued RibsGot nothing but time on your hands? Cook these really low and slow. Set the oven at 300\u00b0 and start checking the ribs after 3 hours.View RecipeWell, first, I\u2019ll riff on what I already know. I recently came upon some lamb ribs at a local farm stand. I took the same approach as BA\u2019s ultimate ribs, seasoning them with a basic dry rub, and pre-cooking them in the oven before finishing them on a medium-hot grill (beware of flare-ups; they\u2019re plenty fatty). Because I had no pomegranate syrup, as our recipe by Seamus Mullen calls for, I simmered some honey with smashed garlic cloves and a pinch of chili flakes. When the nicely charred ribs came off the grill, I painted them with the garlic-infused honey. Sweet, smoky, crispy, meaty. Wow.And because I know I\u2019m adept at developing a quality sear on a steak while hitting the just-right doneness, why not apply that touch to something other than a rib eye? I loved the article in our June/July issue on grilling cuts of meat we typically braise. In winter months, I\u2019m all about pork shoulder and brisket, simmered slowly a Dutch oven. But did you know can take either cut and throw it on your grill?Grilled Brisket with Scallion-Peanut SalsaBrisket\u2019s not just for braising! You have to try it on the grill with this incredible peanut topping.View RecipeFor the grilled brisket, senior food editor Chris Morocco freezes the meat for about 45 minutes, which allows him to thinly slice it, about \u215b\" thick. Into an Asian-inspired marinade it goes, a quick turn on a hot grill, and then it\u2019s finished with a scallion peanut sauce. Brisket like you\u2019ve never had before.Pork Shoulder Steaks with Grilled Mustard GreensNormally you want to braise a pork shoulder\u2014but we\u2019re making a case for throwing it on the grill, with a hell of a spice rub.View RecipeAs for the pork shoulder, it means asking a butcher to carve the boneless cut into \u00be\"-thick steaks. Because it\u2019s seamed with so much intramuscular fat, it yields an addictively flavorful and juicy steak. I couldn\u2019t stop nipping at it when senior associate food editor Molly Baz was developing the recipe in the Test Kitchen.Charred Cabbage with Goat Cheese Raita and CucumbersGarnish with crushed Corn Nuts, win summer.View RecipeFinally, because you can\u2019t survive on meat alone (I think?), I\u2019m going to diversify my vegetable game. On a recent episode of the BA Foodcast about trying to lead a more vegetable-forward life, food director Carla Lalli Music got me all excited to grill cabbage. Who knew? We have a recipe for charred purple cabbage with a cooling mint raita and cucumbers. It\u2019s officially now on my to-grill list.About those ribs though:Recipes you want to make.
