The ones that wear tie-dye headbands or scratchy wool pants that they call slacks? Yeah, well they are missing out\u2014but only if they haven\u2019t drank vintage amaro at Officina in Washington, D.C. Because if they had, they could experience the best parts of the sixties, seventies, or eighties, all poured from bottles sitting right behind the bar.There\u2019s a lot going on at chef Nick Stefanelli\u2019s three-floor Officina: A caf\u00e9, a market, a rooftop bar, a proper restaurant. But on the second floor lives Salotto, a five-seat amaro library with a massive list that span from last year\u2019s batches to the entire century prior.The last time I was in, I drank a Pio Cesare Barolo Chinato from 2018 next to a 1970s Barolo Chinato from now defunct producer Zabaldano. I had Campari from three separate decades, a glass of chartreuse from the 1920s (before the liqueur\u2019s name was trademarked), a glass of Amaro 2000 from the 1980s\u2014which was one of the most bitter things I\u2019ve ever tasted and almost impossible to source. There was that glass of Amaro del Capo from last year alongside an Amaro del Capo from about five decades earlier. And then I had a sip of 1960s Cynar next to a sip of 1970s Cynar next to a sip of 2018 Cynar, and that pretty much blew my mind.All the herbal intricacies of each decade made it feel like I was running around on some kind of spirit-fueled time machine. I could also experience the way that time brought forth different flavors, smoothed out bitterness, and coaxed sweetness into a velvety mouthfeel. I was about six drinks deep, but even so, it became quite clear that when you\u2019re at Officina, you don\u2019t have to pick an era to be obsessed with. You can live them all simultaneously.Go There: The Salotto at OfficinaExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendCocktailWashington, D.C.RestaurantsRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
