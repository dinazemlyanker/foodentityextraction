Nothing beats gathering loved ones around a mountain of these freshly fried treats and biting into the hot chewy-crispy swirls straight out of the fryer.These South Asian treats look intimidatingly beautiful, but jalebi are simple to make. Don\u2019t let the deep-frying deter you\u2014wintery days are the ideal time to turn on the stove and go on a jalebi journey. The urad dal (ivory white lentil) powder in the batter helps the jalebi stay crisp no matter how long they soak in the cardamom-rose syrup. Not a fan of rose? Feel free to flavor your syrup with warm spices or some orange-flower water. Whatever you do, just don\u2019t forget the lemon juice; it prevents the syrup from crystallizing while your jalebi soak it all up. \u2014Mehreen KarimAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Let cool, then finely chop.Step 2Process or blend urad dal in a food processor or blender to a powder (some grainier pieces will remain). Transfer urad dal powder to a large bowl and whisk in flour, baking powder, and ghee. Whisking constantly, gradually pour in 1 cup water; whisk until no large lumps of flour remain. Batter should be viscous. Add more water 1 Tbsp. at a time (up to 5 Tbsp.), whisking constantly, until batter is smooth and falls off the whisk in a long ribbon that slowly dissolves on surface of batter. (You will still have some small, granular lumps of dal.) Transfer batter to a piping bag fitted with a \u00bc\"-diameter tip (or, use a gallon-size resealable plastic bag with a corner cut off to make a \u00bc\" opening or a squeeze bottle).Step 3Bring sugar, cardamom, saffron (if using), rose water (if using), salt, and 1\u00bc cups water to a rolling boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer until syrup coats a spoon, 5\u20137 minutes. Remove syrup from heat and stir in lemon juice; set aside.Step 4Fit thermometer to a medium Dutch oven or other heavy pot. Pour in oil and heat over medium until thermometer registers 350\u00b0. Squeeze a drop of batter into oil. The batter should immediately start to bubble and rise to the surface, but if the batter browns immediately, the oil is too hot. If the batter drops to the bottom of the pot, the oil is not hot enough. Adjust heat as needed. Once oil is ready, carefully squeeze batter into oil to create a 2\"\u20133\"-wide spiral, starting from the outside and circling in. To keep jalebi from sticking together, squeeze no more than 3 spirals into pot at a time. Fry until golden brown, 2\u20133 minutes, then turn over and fry on other side until golden brown, 2\u20133 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer jalebi to reserved syrup and let soak 3\u20135 minutes. Remove soaked jalebi from syrup and place on a platter. Repeat process with remaining batter, squeezing the batter of your next batch into oil while the previous batch is soaking in the syrup. Sprinkle pistachios over jalebi and serve warm.How would you rate Jalebi?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (1)Back to TopTriangleWhen I told my parents I wanted to make jalebis from scratch they were skeptical. But this recipe was easy to follow and yielded tasty results. We omitted the pistachio garnish and they felt like ones I'd eaten on the streets of New Delhi!T1/18/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titIndianSouth AsianAsianDessertDeep-fryRecipes you want to make.
