The eggplant is the star of the show (and the yummy glaze). The eggplant is perfectly cooked and the flavors of the overall dish are great. We used farro as our grain and will definitely make again!Linley Minnesota 12/30/2021Serving this with tofu on some rice made a really delicious fall/winter vegan meal. I also recommend adding some hot spice to the  as it will balance out the rich earthy flavor of the eggplant (I used gochugaru).Emmy BBoston, MA11/6/2020Whenever I spend an entire meal repeatedly saying, \"yum yum yum yum yum,\" in my head and out loud, you know the recipe's a winner. Make this! It's easy to throw together, and it's such a showstopper.AnonymousBoston, MA5/16/2020Fabulous dish! Made these as a side dish in order to trick my parents into eating more vegetables, and they loved it! Will try this again on the grill as the weather warms up this summer.AnonymousDallas, TX5/16/2020this was amazing!! I substituted sugar for honey, and it was lovely. Thank you!AnonymousNew York, ny4/27/2020I didn't make these aubergines as part of a grain bowl (instead a side for supper) and they were delicious. An excellent vegetable dish to serve alongside an Asian-style dish - a bit out of the ordinary but also a crowd-pleaser.AnonymousLondon4/17/2020Just made the aubergine with some wild rice and wow, one of the best weeknight dinner recipes ever. The aubergine is so tender and that glaze is to die for. I didn't have any rice vinegar so didn't include and swapped sugar for some honey instead - still so good!! Also really easy to size down for just one person, not that you need to be honest. Served with spring onions and chopped up peanuts as garnish. Delicious. Thank you Chris!!cecelia.quantLondon1/27/2020Not a review but a question/comment. I\u2019m a little apprehensive of recipes that call for mixed grains because it seem super involved. Am I supposed to have three/four pots going at once to make quinoa, barley and farro? Any tips to streamline this process?AnonymousOttawa, Ontario10/24/2019I know this says 4 servings but I ate all of it by myself over a 5-hour period. I could not focus on anything except the leftovers in my fridge. I could not work. I could not relax. The last 2 servings I ate cold-- totally unwilling to take the two minutes needed to heat it up. I am upset of my behavior, but not with this recipe. AnonymousAustin, TX9/6/2019The sauce/glaze is amazing. Salty, savory, a little sweet. The basil and green onion complemented each other nicely in the grain salad. I think this really shines with the chew and nuttiness of farro, personally, for the grain choice, to balance out the mushy eggplant. For leftovers, I chop up the eggplant so it's easier to manage as a work lunch. I couldn't get eggplants that small so I cut 2 medium eggplants into quarters and it worked just fine. alphabetizingDallas, TX7/14/2019So so very good. I didn't have basil so I left it out, but even without the basil it was phenomenal. The eggplant was tender, the glaze was salty umami heaven, and the grain salad made it into a full meal. I have a few servings left and I'm definitely taking them as work lunches this week. This is my go-to eggplant recipe now. AbbyRAlabama6/9/2019I saut\u00e9ed chunks of eggplant with the miso sauce and it was really yummyAnonymous1/17/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titRice and Grain BowlAsianJapaneseEast AsianEggplantVegetableMisoCondiments, Sauces & PastesGingerHerbs & SpicesBasilSummerEasyQuickWeeknight MealsMainVegetarianHealthyishRoastLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
