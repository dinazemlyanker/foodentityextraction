It\u2019s too easy not to make: Take a can of tomatoes (whole! peeled! no weird bits of basil!), throw in a heavy-bottomed pot with two onions and a lot of butter (it\u2019s a legendary recipe for a reason), and after about 40 minutes of simmering, you\u2019ve got one very luxurious pasta sauce. I love it. So much. As I type this I can imagine my second-grade self sneering at me and asking, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you marry it then?\u201dWell, second-grade me, that\u2019s because Marcella\u2019s sauce and I are actually on a bit of a break. (Didn\u2019t you read the \u201calmost always\u201d part?) Sometimes, that\u2019s what grown women and tomato sauces just need to do. You\u2019ll get it when you\u2019re older. As late summer brings in gleaming bauble-like tomatoes and 85-degree weather with 90 percent humidity, I\u2019ve moved on to this fresh tomato pomodoro recipe from Chris Morocco that\u2019s lighter (no butter!) and sort of surprising (in a good way). It\u2019s unlike any tomato sauce I\u2019ve made before\u2014and I\u2019ve made a lot of tomato sauce.Here\u2019s why. You cook down garlic and big cherry tomatoes until the skins blister and break open. Adding in a few sprigs of bittersweet basil remind you it\u2019s still a pomodoro. But some slivers of fiery Fresno chiles in the sauce and a grand garnish of inky chile oil (I like this fried garlic one) and sesame seeds nudge you into an Asian-ish direction.And here comes the boom: tender, chewy rice noodles turn this pomodoro full-on AZN. Chris says to get \u201cwide rice noodles,\u201d but I went ahead and got the widest ones I could find, nearly two-inch-wide big boys after multiple trips to Asian supermarkets throughout New York City. Because they\u2019re so bouncy and textural, rice noodles make sweet pad thai, mediocre chow fun, and beefy pho just more fun to eat. They also cook in a few minutes, making them a perfect summer dinner, see more recipes here. Plus, rice noodles basically become whatever sauce or soup they\u2019re in (ever make the mistake of not separating the noodles from the broth in leftover pho?).Here in Chris\u2019s rice noodles al pomodoro with chili oil, it\u2019s the perfect pillowy thing for absorbing the smoky, spicy, tomatoey sauce, much like how a young mind grabs soaks up adult sarcasm. And that, child-version of me, is why this particular tomato sauce is my new main squeeze.Get the recipe:Rice Noodles al Pomodoro with Chili OilWe\u2019ve got bursting, jammy cherry tomatoes that make their own sauce, and chili oil that upends the typical Italian flavor profile.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPastaTomato SauceTomatoRead MorecookingTHE Tomato Toast Recipe of Summer 2018By Amanda ShapirocookingWhat Are Heirloom Tomatoes, Anyway?By Alex DelanycookingThese Greens in Tomato-Bacon Broth Are an Unexpected Superstar Summer SideBy Rachel KartenRecipes you want to make.
