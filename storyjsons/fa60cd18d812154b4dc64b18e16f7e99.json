This refrain is something I think about a lot, mostly when I am sick and looking to justify my choices. As in: I do deserve this $14 ramen; I am feeding my cold. This is what the old wives would want.Where exactly the phrase comes from is murky, but according to Quackery: A Brief History of the Worst Ways to Cure Everything, you can trace it back to a 1574 dictionary by the English lexicographer John Withals, who wrote \u201cfasting is a great remedy of fever.\u201d And that does make some intuitive sense, sort of. Fevers produce heat, and heat takes energy. So if you don\u2019t give your body energy to produce the fever, then the fever should go away. Meanwhile, writes Smithsonian, colds were believed to be caused by \u201ca drop in temperature,\u201d which required food to help \u201cstoke the fire.\u201d It is persuasive logic, in a 16th century kind of way.But, in 2018, I could not find a doctor ready to back up the wisdom of the elders. \u201cFirst of all, there\u2019s no truth to \u2018feed a cold, starve a fever,\u2019\u201d says Catherine Troisi, Associate Professor at the Center for Infectious Diseases at the University of Texas School of Public Health. \u201cThat would not be guidance I would give my patients,\u201d agrees Ian Nelligan, Assistant Clinical Professor at Stanford School of Medicine, tactfully.Which is not to say that there is no evidence that the old adage could have (some) merit. In recent years, a number of studies have suggested that, depending on the illness, eating or not eating may in fact bolster recovery. A very buzzy 2002 Dutch study \u201cfound that eating a meal boosts the type of immune response that destroys the viruses responsible for colds, while fasting stimulates the response that tackles the bacterial infections responsible for most fevers,\u201d New Scientist explained. (Also, though, the study had six people in it.)Then, in 2016, an immunologist at Yale was trying to figure out if there might be some unknown protective benefit to not eating while sick\u2014why else do we so often lose our appetites?\u2014and found that the tentative answer seemed to be yes. Mice injected injected with listeria (a foodborne bacterium) had better survival rates if they weren\u2019t force-fed. Mice with a flu virus, though, were drastically more likely to survive if they were. For our purposes, what matters here isn\u2019t the specific diseases, but rather the possibility that what and whether to eat may indeed depend on exactly what\u2019s wrong with you. But it\u2019s early. People aren\u2019t mice. If there\u2019s an immediate takeaway, the study\u2019s lead author, Ruslan Medzhitov told The Atlantic, it\u2019s to listen to your body when you\u2019re sick.That is what everyone keeps telling me. \u201cYou want to make sure that your body has enough energy to fight whatever it is that you\u2019re fighting,\u201d says Molly Broder, a pediatrician at the Children\u2019s Hospital at Montefiore. But if you can\u2019t stomach it, she adds, that\u2019s also fine. As Troisi points out, \u201cyou're not going to starve to death in the week or ten days that a cold lasts.\u201dThe one thing you do have to do when you\u2019re sick is stay hydrated, whether your body tells you to or not. It is a boring truth, but necessary. \u201cYou really should drink even if you're not thirsty,\u201d Troisi says. Drink water. Drink herbal tea. If you\u2019re worried about a dearth of calories, drink fruit juice for god\u2019s sake. Just drink. Not coffee. Not alcohol. But what about a healing shot of whiskey? That\u2019s a question for another day.This is the ultimate dehydration cure:BA Brad\u2019s Classic TonicView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishGet WellRead MoreLifestyleThe Healthyish Guide to Feeling Better AlreadyGallery13 SlidesBy The Healthyish TeamRecipes you want to make.
