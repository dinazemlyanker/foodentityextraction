That\u2019s my motto, at least, when I\u2019ve scoured every gift guide on the internet and still feel stumped. Finding the best gift for everyone in your life is hard, especially when it\u2019s for the pickiest person in your family or the office Secret Santa you\u2019ve only met on Zoom. But after years of gift exchanges, I\u2019ve learned that ornaments often satisfy\u2014especially food ornaments, which require little to no knowledge about your intended recipient. Don\u2019t know whether your sister\u2019s new girlfriend is a reader or if she\u2019s allergic to scented candles? Doesn\u2019t matter\u2014everyone likes burritos, and she can hang one on her tree right next to Rudolph.Whether you\u2019re shopping for your baker friend who couldn\u2019t live without his stand mixer, your millennial cousin who can\u2019t afford a house because of all the avocado toast they eat, or your favorite coworker who always arrives with a pumpkin spice latte in hand, you\u2019re sure to find a food ornament that\u2019s festive, appetizing, and makes a great gift.
