This Thanksgiving turkey with a simple gravy made from the drippings requires nothing more than a trusty rimmed baking sheet and a wire rack that fits inside. Give the bird plenty of time to dry-brine in the refrigerator\u2014at least 24 hours and up to 2 days\u2014for maximum flavor. Once you get roasting, a 12\u201314-lb. turkey will need only about 2 hours (plus 30 minutes of resting time) to turn golden brown and perfectly moist.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Worcestershire sauceFreshly ground black pepperAssorted herb sprigs (for serving; optional)PreparationStep 1Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack inside. Pat turkey dry with paper towels and place, breast side up, on rack.Step 2Mix salt, brown sugar, and paprika in a medium bowl to combine. Pat dry brine all over sides and in cavity of turkey, working into any crevices. Chill turkey, uncovered, at least 24 hours and up to 2 days.Step 3When you are ready to roast turkey, preheat oven to 400\u00b0. Arrange turkey, breast side up, on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet (if using the same baking sheet, throw away foil and rinse pan to remove any accumulated salty liquid). Pour \u00be cup water into baking sheet (this will keep the drippings from burning). Roast, rotating baking sheet halfway through, until golden brown, 35\u201345 minutes.Step 4Meanwhile, melt \u00bd cup butter in a small saucepan over medium.Step 5Remove turkey from oven and brush or spoon half of the butter over turkey. Pour an additional \u2153 cup water into baking sheet.Step 6Reduce oven temperature to 300\u00b0. Return turkey to oven (if any spots are overly dark, like the wing tips, cover with small pieces of foil) and roast, rotating baking sheet and brushing turkey with remaining melted butter halfway through, until well browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 155\u00b0 (temperature will continue to rise as the turkey rests), 70\u201380 minutes. Let rest on baking sheet at least 30 minutes.Step 7Lift and tilt turkey so that all the drippings from the bird and inside the cavity run onto the baking sheet, and transfer turkey to a cutting board. Pour drippings into a large measuring glass, scraping in browned bits stuck to baking sheet with a spatula. Pour in stock as needed to measure 4 cups.Step 8Melt remaining \u00bd cup butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and cook, whisking constantly, until smooth and light golden brown, about 3 minutes. Gradually pour in drippings mixture, whisking constantly until combined. Reduce heat to low and simmer, whisking often, until gravy is thickened, about 5 minutes. Add Worcestershire sauce and whisk well. Season gravy with salt and lots of pepper.Step 9Carve turkey and arrange on a large platter. Tuck herb sprigs around turkey if desired. Serve with gravy on the side.How would you rate Sheet-Pan Turkey and Gravy?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (7)Back to TopTriangleThis is the among the top 3 best turkey I have ever tasted. I don\u2019t even like turkey that much, but when it\u2019s cooked as perfectly as this one was, I had to make another one so I could eat more of it. I\u2019ve never dry brined any meat before and was skeptical, but now I\u2019m a convert. I left the bird in the fridge uncovered for 2 days and did not pick up any refrigerator odors. I used a leave-in meat thermometer to hit the perfect temperature. My family loved it and there weren\u2019t enough leftovers for a sandwich! The gravy presented as a little salty on first bite, but the other flavors  were nicely balanced. It went nicely with mashed potatoes. We have a winner. PatriciaSan Francisco12/12/2021This was the first time I have ever roasted a turkey in my oven.  I followed the directions to the 'T' and it turned out wonderful.  I had a remote temperature sensor in the breast for the entire cooking time and with 40 seconds left in the allotted time in recipe, the breast hit 155*F.  Guests could not believe that I cooked a 14.6 lb Turkey in 2 hours.  Lazlo HollyfeldByram, NJ11/29/2021Used this recipe through step two.  Step 3 for temp guidance and then roasted in an old fashion electric roaster, which reduced the cook time a bit.  This was the best turkey I have made in a very long time.  My family picked right up on smoked paprika and loved it.  The bird came out moist and tender.  We are making this our go-to Thanksgiving turkey recipe!AnastasiaCCanton, MI11/27/2021This turkey turned out perfectly. Nicely browned and very flavorful. I don't stuff my turkey, so this was a good recipe for me. I appreciate the easy prep and clean-up!Alice F.Flagstaff, AZ11/26/2021Can I cover the turkey while it\u2019s dry-brining in the fridge? I have a big plastic bag it was wrapped in. I don\u2019t want it to take on any fridge-flavorsCasie Saint Paul, mn 11/24/2021Listened to the podcast and want to clear up the mystery about roasting a turkey for such a long time in the old days. We always roasted the stuffing inside the bird, and low and slow was pretty important.
