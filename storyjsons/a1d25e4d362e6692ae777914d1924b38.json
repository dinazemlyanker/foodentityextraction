I made this last night and I\u2019m still dreaming about it. Simple ingredients, easy to put together and so so so delicious. Already can\u2019t wait to make it again. AnonymousToronto2/6/2022I just made this and it was one of the best things that I ever put in my mouth. For me that's saying a lot because cooking is my passion and I make a lot of awesome dishes. It's winter and I never knew that clementines are so super ripe and juicy this time of year. The arugula was from my garden picked an hour before serving. I served it with a toasted baguette sliced on a bias and the only adjustment that I had to make was to squeeze another half of a clementine into the dressing because the dates really thickened it up. I would have added toasted pistachio nuts if I had them but the dish didn't need them.AnthonyMiami1/22/2022The arugula was weird IMO, texture-wise.AnonymousColumbia, SC1/11/2020This recipe is SO simple and bright and delicious. We tested the recipe a week prior to Thanksgiving hoping we could serve it as an appetizer before the Big Meal. Good news\u2014it's exactly what we were looking for and now my mother has no choice but to be impressed. Right, Mom??AnonymousKansas City, MO11/18/2019Great recipe! It's light and bright but seems so upscale for something that only takes a few minutes to throw together. I used mandarins instead of clementines which were fine, just a big bigger than ideal, so I would stick with clementines in the future.AnonymousSan Francisco, CA3/28/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladRicottaCheeseClementineCitrusFruitDateDried FruitWinterQuickEasySideNut-FreeDinnerBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
