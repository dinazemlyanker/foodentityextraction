See our past recommendations here!When I wake up these days, I\u2019m scared to look at my phone. But then I do because I can\u2019t help it. Now that I\u2019m working from home, social distancing, and self-isolating, my phone is both a tether to the outside world and a device filled with unwelcome distress. That\u2019s why a little (free!) app called #SelfCare has become my virtual sanctuary: a private, digital place to hang out in and tend to a small world that I can control.#SelfCare is set in a bedroom, where your customized avatar can spend the day lounging around and exploring their virtual space along with all the objects in it. Beyond the incredibly soothing, spa-like soundtrack, there are very simple tasks you can do\u2014or not do\u2014it\u2019s up to you. Picking up dirty clothes and tossing them in the hamper or folding laundry in a virtual bedroom is incredibly satisfying. There are also tarot cards (ironically, I chose The Hermit this morning), breathing exercises, crystals, basic but meaningful word games, and even a cat to pet. It\u2019s a safe, meditative space that provides me with a brief break from reality.The app was created by TRU LUV, a small gaming studio based in Toronto, Canada. Founder Brie Code left her job as a head designer to create games for people who don\u2019t relate to traditional video games (me) and who are in search of healthier digital outlets (also me). She teamed up with Eve Thomas, an artist and writer, who modeled #SelfCare\u2019s bedroom on her own. Code and Thomas put together a diverse team (including an official Witch-in-Residence), to create the visually engaging, techno-pagan app, which is constantly updated and tweaked as it learns what you like to do, so it can help you reach calm as effectively as possible.These days, a lot of us could use as much companionship as we can get. Even if we have to stay in our IRL bedrooms all day, #SelfCare offers a different sort of sanctuary, even if it\u2019s just a five-minute break from the news.Check it out:#SelfCareExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSelf CareHealthyish Loves ItShoppingRead MoreCoronavirus17 Ways to Feel Good at Home Right NowBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
