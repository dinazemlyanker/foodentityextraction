When I chatted with Miranda about his favorite things to eat in Washington Heights, the upper Manhattan neighborhood he grew up in, the frothy, creamy Latin beverage made of fresh orange juice, evaporated milk, and sugar made up some of his strongest memories. \u201cMorir so\u00f1ando is my favorite Latin drink\u2014it literally means \u2018to die dreaming.\u2019 It\u2019s like a really rich, creamy Orange Julius and it\u2019s the most delicious shit ever,\u201d he said.\u201cI can\u2019t have it as much as I used to because I don\u2019t have my twenty-something metabolism anymore,\u201d he added with a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s fattening, but it\u2019s a delicious indulgence.\u201d But when he allows himself, he\u2019ll get it from a Caridad\u2014a Latin caf\u00e9, like El Nuevo Caridad) in the Heights\u2014alongside a strong coffee and a crispy \u201cham and cheese sandwich that they cook with that toaster that looks like a flatiron.\u201d He isn\u2019t picky about which Caridad he goes to, he just wants to continue supporting immigrant-owned restaurants, especially on Small Business Saturday, this year on November 24.Here\u2019s a recipe for morir so\u00f1ando.\nPhoto by Chelsea Kyle, Food Styling by Katherine SacksAnother of his family\u2019s neighborhood favorite\u2019s is the classic Dominican breakfast staple mang\u00fa, a mix of green plantains mashed with olive oil, and salt. \u201cIt\u2019s so thick, you could caulk a house with it, but it\u2019s so delicious. You eat that for breakfast with onions and a fried egg on top, and then you don\u2019t have to eat another meal for the rest of the day.\u201d Caridad has a good verison, he says, but his family also went to 809 for a heaping plate, knowing full-well that their appetites would be sated after that.Miranda can\u2019t recall the first time he tried any of these Latin specialties, but they\u2019ve remained a constant in his life. \u201cI don\u2019t remember being introduced to it. It was just always around,\u201d he said. \u201cFor most of performing Hamilton, I was all the way uptown in Inwood. I was very close to my ham and cheese sandwiches, coffee, and morir so\u00f1ando. They never went far.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titCelebritiesLatin AmericanOrangeRead MorecultureRob Corddry Ate This Italian Sandwich Every Week for DecadesBy Alyse WhitneycultureTig Notaro Loves These Po'Boys So Much She Served Them at Her WeddingBy Alyse WhitneycultureCecily Strong on the Childhood Dish That Changed EverythingBy Alyse WhitneyRecipes you want to make.
