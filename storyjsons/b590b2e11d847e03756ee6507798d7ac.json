Spread out torn bread on a rimmed baking sheet. Set a wire rack in baking sheet over bread and arrange bacon on rack (it\u2019s okay if strips overlap a bit; they\u2019ll shrink as they cook). This setup will crisp the bacon, and as the bread becomes enriched with some of the drippings, it will get nice and toasty. Bake 20 minutes. Remove from oven and turn bacon. Carefully tilt baking sheet to pour off any fat into a small bowl; reserve for another use if desired. Return to oven and bake until bacon is brown and crisp and breadcrumbs are golden brown, about 20 minutes more. Transfer bacon and toasted breadcrumbs to separate paper towels to drain.Step 2Slide breadcrumbs, still on paper towels, to a cutting board and crush into very small pieces with a flat-bottomed measuring cup. Season with salt, place on a small plate or in a small bowl, and set aside for serving.Step 3Meanwhile, whisk mayonnaise, lemon zest, lemon juice, horseradish, pepper, and \u00bd tsp. salt in a small bowl to combine; set aside.Step 4Arrange bacon, lettuce leaves, tomatoes, basil, and lemon wedges on a platter or on a couple of plates and in bowls so that each component is visible and easily accessible. Set out kitchen shears next to bacon for cutting to size. Serve with breadcrumbs and reserved horseradish mayonnaise (for spreading over lettuce).How would you rate BLT Wraps with Horseradish Mayonnaise?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleIf this is a wrap, shouldn't there be WRAPS in the list of ingredients?\nAnd toasted breadcrumbs in a wrap?Anonymouscoastal Alabama9/6/2020I made a salad-ified version of this -- a wrap just didn't feel like it set me up for the right ratio of ingredients. I chopped up Boston lettuce (what I had at my loval grocer), toned the horseradish down a bit, but tossed the rest of the ingredients together. YUM. The breadcrumbs and bacon are so rich and salty, the tomatoes cut through it nicely, the basil is a fitting surprise addition to the BLT format, and the dressing is so delightful.AnonymousHouston, TX8/16/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titSandwichWrapBaconCured MeatMeatLettuceLeafy GreensVegetableCherry TomatoTomatoHorseradishHerbs & SpicesSummerEasyWeeknight MealsSheet-Pan DinnersMainNut-FreeHealthyishLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
