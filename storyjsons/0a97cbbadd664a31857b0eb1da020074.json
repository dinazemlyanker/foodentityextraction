I take my gifting seriously. Case in point: this Dash mini toaster oven, with its powder yellow exterior and diminutive size that inspires Easy Bake-esque nostalgia. I knew it would be the hot-ticket item of the exchange, but I didn\u2019t know that the lucky recipient, my colleague Christa, would keep it at her desk\u2014and forever elevate my office snack oeuvre.Instead of eating too-ripe bananas or pitiful fruit snacks from the office kitchen, I can reheat leftover Buffalo wings until they\u2019re back to their crispy, finger-licking state or bust out a box of Bagel Bites to fully embrace the small-scale culinary experience. I have even made pigs in a blanket. The sky (or 3-inch clearance above the tray) is the limit!Let me be clear: This toaster oven isn\u2019t just cute; it really works! It heats up to a sizzlin\u2019 400 degrees and lets out an elegant ding when time\u2019s up. While it would be ambitious to cook an entire meal with this little guy, the Dash oven is perfectly engineered to warm up a batch of afternoon snacks. It breathes new life into leftovers and is a friend of all frozen foods. It is as versatile and competent as it is precious. And with that, I say: Purchase it lovingly, use it frequently, unplug it after using.Dash Mini Toaster Oven$25 $24 at Amazon$30 at Bed Bath & BeyondExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendShoppingRead MorecultureThe Only Sheet Pan You\u2019ll Ever Need Costs $20 and Will Last a LifetimeBy Ali FrancisRecipes you want to make.
