Stay for the perfectly grilled b-liner snapper.By Hilary CadiganApril 2, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Mira AdwellFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.Despite living in New York, I spend a lot of time in Charleston. It\u2019s where my fianc\u00e9 hails from, where my future in-laws live, and where I\u2019ll be getting married in T-minus 25 days (no, not freaking out at all, thanks for asking). This means I spend a lot of time eating in Charleston and what that means is an endless array of trendy new seafood spots.Don\u2019t get me wrong: They\u2019re all good (it\u2019s hard to mess up fresh-caught seafood when you\u2019re surrounded by water) but they do tend to blend together. Which is why I was surprised by how much newcomer Chubby Fish surprised me.Chef James London\u2019s dishes change often\u2014a smoky and well-balanced mackerel curry, a grilled b-liner snapper doused in fresh ginger and scallions\u2014but maintain a consistent degree of playfulness that could come off as hokey if it weren\u2019t so well-executed. We\u2019re talking crunchy-meaty chicken-fried cobia collar, caviar service with \u201cbo rounds\u201d (fried potato medallions in the style of beloved Southern fast-food institution Bojangles), and local sweets peddler Cynthia Wong\u2019s \u201cnot fried chicken\u201d (a drumstick-shaped chunk of waffle-flavored ice cream wrapped around a chocolate-covered Cadbury finger biscuit \u201cbone\u201d and dusted in crushed cornflakes ). Standbys like Nicaraguan beer and housemade plum mignonette for the perfectly-shucked oysters complete the experience: fun, unexpected, yet approachable enough not to scare off the aforementioned in-laws.Go there: Chubby FishExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendCharlestonSeafoodRestaurantsRecipes you want to make.
