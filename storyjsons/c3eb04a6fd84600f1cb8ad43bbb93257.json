Felix is that good.ORDER: all the gluten. You\u2019re here for the noodles, so get the transcendent cacio e pepe, spiny busiate with pesto trapanese, simple but stellar orecchiette with sausage sugo and peperoncino, and fat rigatoni all\u2019amatriciana. But don\u2019t sleep on the focaccia\u2014it\u2019s pillowy, bready heaven.THE VIBE IS: \u201cwork hard, play hard\u201d in restaurant form.
