Chopped-up cauliflower and mushrooms provide comparable richness and texture to what you usually get from the classic long-cooked ground meat sauce.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

A lot of effort with bland results.CaraCharlottesville, Va2/25/2022I DON'T understand people who leave a negative review after subbing out most of the recipe...I followed the recipe as written except used a mix of mushrooms, which was what was available in my grocery store.  I DO NOT like mushrooms, but I gave this a go since we are trying to eat some plant-based meals once in awhile.   It was really good.  It had the texture of bolgnese, and a good depth of flavor.  By chopping up the mushrooms I really couldn't tell they were in there.  I will make this again., and will also pass it along to friends who are vegetarian. LindaNew Jersey2/4/2022Great recipe.  Going to make it again this week.PWHaddon Heights, NJ1/9/2022Ignore the negative reviews left by those who went off-script!! This was so good and satisfying. You really don\u2019t miss the meat just like Andy said. :)\n\nFollowed the recipe to a T, except I was a little short on cremini mushrooms and added mushroom powder to help make up the difference. Used the food processor to also chop the onion. Opted for the chili flakes rather than a fresh pepper.\n\nIf you follow the recipe as written, I can\u2019t imagine how this comes out as poorly as others described. kkSeattle1/4/2022I made this with 'nomato' sauce, and it still turned out great!MeenakshiIndia12/28/2021Super surprised that people say it didn't turn out like the picture, as I felt like this was one of the easiest recipes I've ever made to get looking like the \"styled\" photo. I used fresh shiitakes and got them nice and browned before moving on, same deal with every ingredient, and followed the recipe exactly. I would imagine adding a bunch of extra veggies (like carrots/celery even though they're \"traditional\") would water down the sauce, as would using chanterelles instead of the recommended shiitakes (chanterelles are probably 2-3 times as \"wet\" as shiitakes), so that could be peoples' issue? Also, using \"double concentrated\" tomato paste (the kind that comes in a tube) per recipe instructions is essential: if you're just using the normal canned stuff you're skimping on a lot of potential umami. I'm not a vegetarian and have had \"real\" bolognese countless times, and while not an exact copy, this is a very good dish in its own right. \nA tip to help beef up the flavor and texture might be to use as little water and as much salt as possible when cooking your pasta to really up the starchy broth factor, and only add to the sauce a quarter cup at a time, stirring vigorously until it reaches a velvety consistency. I wonder to myself about people who start by changing a bunch about the recipe and then comment how it didn't work for them...AnonymousSeattle, WA10/28/2021This was such a painful dish to cook.  At every turn it was so far away from what it needed to be...  But I'm not a vegetarian and neither is anyone in my family.  I'm just on a mission to feed them more veggies.  I changed a lot about the recipe but I stayed true to it being vegetarian.  I started off with a basic assortment of carrots, onions, garlic to get the \"sauce going.\"  I used the food processor for my mushrooms (chanterelles and crimini) and cauliflower.  1 head of cauliflower was way too much.  I minced the rosemary and added some sage.  All the veg created an enormous amount of water - no bueno - and I spent the good part of an hour trying to \"cook it off.\"  I added an embarrassing amount of salt and pepper (not to mention red wine) just to give the whole thing color and an attempt towards flavor.  Against my better judgment I added in the cheese to the sauce (which I normally would never do) and it showed.  The sauce was stringy and goopy and just not bolognese.  Sad to say - my family ate it but I got nasty looks all through dinner.  I'm trying to figure out what neighborhood dog to feed the leftovers to since even our parrots looked at me like I was nuts.  If I had no idea what 'real' bolognese was supposed to taste like...maybe...just maybe...this could work.  Anyone who's eaten the real deal will eat this and cry themselves to sleep at night.AnonymousMill Valley, CA10/20/2021I\u2019ve made this a million times, sometimes subbing with what I have on hand. It\u2019s so good when omnivores have it, they don\u2019t realize there\u2019s no meat. Mushroom haters don\u2019t know there\u2019s mushrooms in it. It\u2019s so savory and delicious!  It can be made vegan easily without compromising flavor. AlOhio10/18/2021Full disclosure - I subbed cauliflower with carrots. This recipe is awesome. The End. Not really....I did some research (I'm a researcher) after making the substitution thinking I'd chosen a more nutrient dense (and flavorful) veg with carrots. I was surprised. Moving forward I will absolutely make this recipe again, but I will use a 50/50 mix of carrots and cauliflower. They balance what the other lacks, like any good relationship. Look, I love meat. I'm not proud of it and I'm trying to inch towards vegetarian every day for ethical, health, and environmental reasons. However, I did not miss meat in this recipe one single bit. It is robust, so flavorful and satisfying that I didn't feel the need for parm. I'm one of those people who likes a lot of richness in my food. I have a high metabolism and my body craves fat, but this was perfect for me as is. With the following exceptions that were just regular items for me: I added thyme, a bay leaf, and a splash of red wine like many others here. This will be in regular rotation. Andy never disappoints. BA: Please make your recipes filterable by chef, please and thank you. Minnie's MomLos Angeles10/6/2021How could this turn out so bad? I did everything as written. It is Not Edible.\nI am thinking some of the steps need to be changed up - onions first, garlic next - hello? No way would the onions brown to golden after the sticky mushroom mush was \"done\", an throwing on the cauli-rice... I just wanted to cry.\n1/3 cup double concentrate tomato paste made not one dent in the non-de-script colour of the cauliflower- mushroom stuff. Who took that mouth-watering photo anyway?\nFinally, I decided life was too short to safe this.\nAnyone else had this experience or was I targeted by bad food energy?MarianneTerrace, BC Canada10/5/2021Why are stems removed?linstickCanada10/4/2021Haven't made it yet, but I will be adding carrot and celery as the traditional recipe calls for.  The mushroom and cauli are great subs for the meat.AnonymousCT9/24/2021This is delicious!  We are not vegetarians, but make regular Bolognese a lot.  Highly recommended!sharonSan Luis Obispo CA4/22/2021I have now made this five times, maybe six. This recipe is so very good. The key is using the amount of mushrooms called for in the recipe. Do not skimp, ask me how I know. It needs careful tending but you are rewarded at the end. I tried with the rigatoni but I just don't like that shape. So I have used spaghetti and pappardelle.  It is a wonderful sauce and makes a lot. Freezes well.Annie RamsaySan Diego, CA4/18/2021Delicious. Highly recommend. Easy. Layered flavors. Used a mix of shrooms including cultivated. Feared I didn't have earthy-enough shrooms so I rehydrated some shiitake in water and added that. Added white white wine (because that's what I had open but would have prob been even better with red) to deglaze the pan after the tomato paste. I was using pasta the kids had cooked earlier so I didn't have pasta water. Used water from rehydrating the shrooms instead. Even though it didn't have starch it worked to make it sauce-y with the butter. Used thyme instead of rosemary because that's what I had. Threw in a parmesan rind while everything cooked and so I didn't add grated parmesan. Loved the lemon zest at the end. I had way too much garlic but other than that I loved it. Def do again. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because I'm stingy with my stars. Def make again.DeniseDetroit, MI3/9/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titPastaCauliflowerVegetableMushroomRigatoniPasta & NoodlesMainVegetarianNut-FreeHealthyishDinnerRecipes you want to make.
