It was fantastic. Super easy and absolutely delicious! We will for sure be making this again.AnikaLos Angeles, CA1/5/2021This is the easiest to make \"gourmet\" breakfast dish ever! Nailed it the first time and mom and both kids loved it, so huge hit for mother's day! Definitely going in the rotation.LachlanGADecatur GA5/13/2018This has become my new favorite savoury breakfast. I make it whenever I have a little extra time on the weekend and feel like treating myself. I just love the variety of flavours and textures packed into this dish. \nSide note: If I scale down the recipe for just myself I can usually roast the Kale and bacon on the same pan,taking the Kale out earlier.\nThe so-called 'superfoods' like Kale and Turmeric blend in seamlessly, making this recipe kind of a no-brainer. kelseynish8762Calgary,CA4/16/2018Hey anonymous, it's in the \"fourth paragraph\" - \"keeping skillet tilted, add tumeric to oil...\"\n\nBon appetit.
