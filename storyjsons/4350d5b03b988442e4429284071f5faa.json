The fun part is forming the balls, and you don\u2019t need to be a sushi chef to do it. The secret is to use slightly warm rice for easy molding and to keep a bowl of water nearby to dip your hands in to prevent sticking. As for soy sauce, you won\u2019t need it. These little flavor bombs are tasty all on their own. This recipe makes 3\u20134 balls of each type (tuna, umeboshi, and kimchi). If you only want one flavor, simply increase your filling of choice.\u201dAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt\u00bccup furikake or toasted sesame seedsPreparationStep 1Place 2 cups sushi rice in a large bowl and pour in cold water to cover by 2\"\u20133\". Gently swish around with your hands to rinse, then drain. Repeat process until water is almost clear (about 3 more times). Pour cold water over rice to cover by 1\" and let soak 30 minutes (this will help the grains cook more evenly). Drain well in a sieve.Step 2Combine rice and 2\u00bd cups water in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer rice until water is absorbed, 12\u201314 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit (still covered) 15 minutes. This will allow rice to steam and become tender. Uncover and gently fluff rice with a fork. Let sit until cool enough to handle but still warm.Step 3Meanwhile, cut three 8\u00bdx7\u00bd\" toasted nori sheets into 3x1\u00bc\" strips with kitchen shears; set aside.Step 4Prepare the fillings. Mix one 5-oz. can tuna, 2 Tbsp. mayonnaise, preferably Kewpie, and 1 tsp. soy sauce in a small bowl to combine. Place 4 umeboshi on a cutting board. Working one at a time, press a chef\u2019s knife against fruit until pit is exposed; pull out and discard. Set fruit aside (no need to chop). Working over the sink and using your hands, squeeze liquid out of \u2153 cup kimchi; chop into small pieces.Photo and Food Styling by Diana YenStep 5Place 1 cup water in a small bowl and stir in \u00be tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt. Dip your hands in the salted water, then scoop a little less than \u2153 cup rice into 1 hand. Form into a thick disk 3\"\u20134\" in diameter (keep remaining rice in pot covered). Create a small indentation in the center and add 1\u20132 tsp. filling of choice (or a whole umeboshi). Mold rice up and over filling to create a sphere (filling should not be visible), then press firmly with index finger and thumb to form into a triangle. Place on cutting board or a baking sheet. Repeat with remaining rice and filling, dipping your hands in salt water each time. (You\u2019ll have extra tuna\u2014save it for making a tuna salad sandwich or spooning onto crackers.)Step 6Place \u00bc cup furikake or toasted sesame seeds on a small plate. Wrap bottom of each onigiri with a strip of reserved nori, then roll remaining exposed sides in furikake.Photo and Food Styling by Diana YenStep 7Do ahead: Onigiri can be made 2 days ahead.
