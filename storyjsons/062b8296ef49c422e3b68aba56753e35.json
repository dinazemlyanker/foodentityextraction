It\u2019s a secret thread the Test Kitchen uses to announce when recipes in development are ready for relevant editors to taste and give feedback. Meaning, not just any staffer can show up or else the whole BA team would come (free food!). So even when I see alerts for everything bagel quiche (!), molten caramel cake (!!), butternut squash Parm (!!!), I quietly restrain myself from just, you know, conveniently making a visit to the Test Kitchen to \u201cask someone something.\u201d But when I saw senior food editor Chris Morocco announce a Spicy Chicken Katsu Sandwich, I just couldn\u2019t help myself.When I got to the kitchen, Chris told me his idea was to marry the katsu sando\u2014a beloved Japanese convenience store classic\u2014with hot chicken\u2014the insanely spicy, craggy-textured bird from Nashville. The result would be a panko-stubbled, cayenne-spiked cutlet cradled between two slices of cottony-soft milk bread slathered with a pickle-y spicy mayo. Yeah, I mean, who could stay away?Here\u2019s how it went down.Chris\u2019s first thought was to soak the chicken thighs in buttermilk and hot sauce, but it was too wet and gloppy to cook successfully in an inch of oil, like you would with katsu. \u201cKatsu is a little bit delicate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be knocked about with abandon.\u201dSo he ditched the marination and opted for two types of heat, distributed throughout the cooking process instead: 1) A healthy amount of smoky cayenne went into the panko dredge, 2) a lot of Crystal hot sauce was beaten into the dredging eggs, 3) little more was mixed in into the mayo with some chopped bread and butter pickles.Though it doesn\u2019t have that same burn-your-face-off heat as true Nashville hot chicken (we\u2019ve got a different recipe for that right here), the Louisiana-style Crystal hot sauce Chris chose has a fruity, vinegary, not-too-hot heat that he felt would bring another, tamer spice dimension to the sandwich. \u201cSo many flavors are going on here,\u201d he says of the sauce. \u201cYou get the sweetness to keep you from falling off the cliff, the acidity to brighten it\u2014the spice is there to support all of it.\u201d (If you want your sandwich even hotter, add an extra splash of sauce to your mayo mix, or right on top the shredded lettuce you add to the sandwich.)In the end, it\u2019s neither totally faithful to Nashville hot chicken, nor is it 100 percent traditional katsu in its preparation. But it\u2019s tasty as all get out, and it owes its beautifully balanced, crunchy-creamy-spicy-pickle-y life to both.Get the recipe:Spicy Chicken Katsu SandwichesThe shattering panko crispiness of katsu-style cutlets plus the fiery heat of Nashville-style hot chicken, all in one sandwich.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titFried ChickenSandwichRead MorecookingA Grilled Chicken Sandwich Doesn\u2019t Have to Be Boring and FloppyBy Alex Beggs and Molly BazshoppingThe Best Cooling Rack Will Reward You With Crispy Fried Chicken and Tender CakesBy Tiffany HopkinsRecipes you want to make.
