Instead, it\u2019s a melt-in-your-mouth tender, schmaltzy, slow-roast version that\u2019s more similar to rotisserie chicken\u2014except (bonus!) it gets slathered in the funky-spicy-sweet gochujang. And while the meat might be the star of the show, don't discount those buttery-soft, nearly-confited potatoes, which cook gently in the chicken fat. Makes you wonder why you haven't always been roasting long-cooking vegetables\u2014carrots, cauliflower, turnips (?!), winter squash, fennel\u2014under the bird for a built-in side, huh?All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Morton kosher salt, plus moreFreshly ground black pepper5Tbsp. gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)\u00bccup plus 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil2heads of garlic1\u00bd\" piece fresh ginger1\u00bdlb. baby Yukon Gold potatoes (about 1\u00bd\" in diameter)5scallions2limes2tsp. honeyPreparationStep 1Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 300\u00b0. This is an important temperature for this recipe, so if you don\u2019t have an oven thermometer already, now is the time to get one! Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Place on a small rimmed baking sheet. Season 1 3\u00bd\u20134-lb. whole chicken all over with 1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1\u00be tsp. Morton kosher salt and lots of freshly ground black pepper, making sure to season the inside cavity.Step 2Whisk 5 Tbsp. gochujang and \u00bc cup extra-virgin olive oil in a medium bowl until combined. Finely grate 3 garlic cloves (from one of the heads of garlic) into gochujang oil. Peel  1 \u00bd\" piece fresh ginger (a spoon can get the job done), then grate into gochujang oil; whisk to combine.Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 3Cut what\u2019s left of the head of garlic in half crosswise. Repeat with second head of garlic. Stuff 2 garlic halves inside cavity of chicken. Tie legs together with kitchen twine.Step 4Using a pastry brush, brush half of gochujang oil over chicken.Step 5Toss 1\u00bd lb. baby Yukon Gold potatoes and remaining 2 garlic halves and 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in remaining gochujang oil until well coated. Season lightly with salt and pepper and toss again to combine.Step 6Arrange potatoes in a 12\" cast-iron skillet, scooting them toward edges of pan to make space for chicken. Nestle garlic halves (cut sides down) in center of skillet. Place chicken over garlic\u2014as it roasts, it will infuse the fat (and thus, the potatoes) with flavor. If any potatoes have shimmied their way under the chicken, use tongs to arrange them around it (they won\u2019t cook at the same rate if they\u2019re under the chicken).Step 7Roast chicken and potatoes, turning potatoes once or twice to coat in juices and oil that accumulate in pan, until potatoes are very tender when pressed with the back of a spoon, and chicken skin is deep reddish-golden brown in color, 2\u00bd\u20133 hours. When you wiggle the legs of the chicken, they should feel loose in the joints, meaning the meat is fall-apart tender. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and let rest 10\u201315 minutes. Don't skip this step: Letting the bird rests helps the juices in the meat to settle (in other words, it makes the meat juicier).Step 8Meanwhile, use the back of a large spoon or a potato masher to gently smash potatoes in skillet, exposing some of their flesh to juices underneath so they can soak them up.Step 9Finish the potatoes: Thinly slice 5 scallions on a long diagonal. Cut 2 limes in half. Cut 1 half into wedges and set aside. Stir 2 tsp. honey and juice of remaining lime half into potatoes. Taste potatoes and season with more salt if needed. Scatter sliced scallions over potatoes.Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 10Carve chicken, then arrange pieces over potatoes and scallions. Serve right out of skillet with remaining lime wedges alongside for squeezing, and squeeze out the sweet, slow-roasted garlic cloves as you wish.\u2192  Nervous about carving the bird? This video should help.Step 11Do Ahead: Chicken can be seasoned 12 hours ahead. Chill chicken if you\u2019re not going to cook within 2 hours of seasoning.How would you rate Slow-Roast Gochujang Chicken?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (174)Back to TopTriangleVery good! Dad & I loved it. For your reference:\n\n* Used 4 chicken quarters (thigh + drumstick) - took a smidge over 2 hours at 300\n* Potatoes were like 90% done at 2 hours. Smashed them and put in oven at 375 while chicken rested 15 min\n* Used 1/2 potatoes, 1/2 sunchokes. Great. Wouldn't use all sunchokes as they are pretty sweet, but if you're worried about the spice it's a great way to cut into that spice.\n* For a veg version, I could easily see making only with veggies (potato, sunchoke, turnip). Would avoid carrot. Rutabega - maybe? Serve with an Asian peanut noodle salad, or fried tofu cubes in either this gochugang marinade or something a little soy-shaoxing sweet/savory?sarinaboston ma3/11/2022I\u2019ve made this as described without the squeeze of lime juice on the potatoes.  all else perfect.  I like lime juice on beef. Anonymous3/4/2022I made this exactly as written. 4 lb chicken and roasted completely by 3 hours. The garlic inside the bird I do not understand the significance. It was still raw and because of that it could not have added to flavor. The potatoes were excellent, and the chicken was very tender. My guests loved it. Next time no garlic in the bird and I may up the temp to 325 as the outside could have been browner and more caramelized. Served it with a side of Asian Slaw dressed with peanut sauce.AustinTxGalAustin, TX2/27/2022the recipe calls for 4 t honey but only 2 t are mentioned in the steps to make it\nAnonymousNew york, ny United States2/21/2022It was delicious, highly recommended!Alejandro JourdanMexico City2/20/2022It could just be a glitch. I'm having the same problem, doesn't mean that Bon Appetite is trying to make us pay for a recipe. This is the first time I've experienced this. I just screenshot the steps... easy enough. The chicken is baking right now and smells sooo good. JaimeePittsburgh2/18/2022I made this recipe exactly as it was given and it was absolutely delicious. My husband said he thought it was now his favorite dish.   The chicken was extremely tender ( heritage chicken was used) .The potatoes were Savory.  Will be making it again. If you are making this for company it's perfect because it will cook for 3 hours or so in the oven while you entertain and then you can just pull it out at the end and finish itAnonymousNew York2/16/2022Allow me to voice a dissenting opinion.  The chicken was fine.  The garlic underneath the chicken did not cook.  After adding the lime juice to the potatoes made them horrid.  Won't make this again.AnonymousNYC2/15/2022This was fantastic.  I used  bone-in, skin-on thighs.  They were done much sooner than anticipated, so I lowered the oven temp to 175, covered the pan with foil and let everything sit for another hour.  The chicken was still moist and delicious.  I mixed up the full recipe for the sauce, but cut back on the potatoes and garlic but next time I'll do as much as I can squeeze in the pan.  Since my husband is not a fan of spicy food I only used 3 tbs of go-chu-jang, but next time I'll use all 5 tbs.macaroni rascalUpper Southampton, PA2/14/2022We\u2019ve made this 3 times now and each time I love it more. This may be our favorite chicken dish ever. The sweet, spicy, lime-y potatoes are so wonderful too. Perfect Sunday dinner.
