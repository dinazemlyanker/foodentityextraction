At its five locations in the city, the Coffee Collective perfectly nails the style, vibe, and flavor profile of what you imagine a Scandinavian coffee shop to be. Hit the J\u00e6gersborggade location to anchor a morning on one of the city\u2019s coolest streets; venture to the Godth\u00e5bsvej location to check out the roastery; and try the smallest shop on Bernikow, which is dark and clubby like the old-man\u2019s bar it once was. The Torvehallerne spot is a good place to refuel, and the newest location is at Broens Gadek\u00f8kken, a food market started by Noma's ownersPRACTICAL STUFF: Each location has different hours, so visit the website beforehand.\u2014Christine MuhlkeWE ALSO LOVEDemocratic CoffeeOne more reason to love the library (or at least this Indre By one): buttery croissantsLa BanchinaGet real R&R in at this Amager Harbor vegetable-focused restaurant with a few surprisesAndersen & Maillard Forget all about Paris and its croissants at this spare N\u00f8rrebro bakeryExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
