That is, Before Good Wine Stopper and After Good Wine Stopper. Back in the B.G.W.S. days, I re-used the other end of the original cork, which I may or may not have accidentally already thrown in the trash, or jammed a hideous zebra head cork I got from an ex into my bottle. But more often than not, I\u2019d just end up finishing the entire thing, because I didn\u2019t trust any of my other options. Yeah, there were many hangovers during the B.G.W.S. era.Then during a late-night Amazon binge, I bought a pack of Rabbit bottle stoppers, and entered the era of A.G.W.S. These bottle stoppers are made with rubber and stainless steel to provide an actually-airtight seal. For real, I\u2019ve left a bottle with one in for a week or so, and it tasted just as good as when I first opened it. Another bonus: Each stopper has rubber ridges and a funnel-like shape, making it easy to remove. My teeth are very happy to no longer have to pull out an old cork. They\u2019re not too bad looking either, with a sleek shape and fun colors that are way more sophisticated than the random zoo animal heads that used to poke out of my bottles.Do I still finish a bottle every once in a while in this new A.G.W.S. era? Sure. But is it because I am afraid it\u2019ll go bad in my fridge? Definitely not.Buy it: Rabbit Bottle Stoppers, $10 on AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
