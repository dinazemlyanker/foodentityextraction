How are you supposed to know what\u2019s right? Chris Morocco is here to help.As he sees it, there are three qualities that any cooking tong worth owning possesses: a short length, a pull-tab locking mechanism, and plastic-tipped heads. In other words, these 9-inch OXO tongs are the ones you\u2019ll likely find in the BA Test Kitchen.Photo by Emma FishmanOXO Locking Tongs with Nylon Heads$14 at Sur La Table$14 $13 at AmazonWhether you\u2019re nestling a 30-oz rib-eye against a blazing hot cast iron skillet or fishing out a whole chicken from a stock pot or tossing pasta to coat every strand in sauce, being able to wield a pair of tongs with precision and confidence is key. \u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t believe in long tongs,\u201d says Chris. \u201cYou have less control. With a long tong, you\u2019re not able to manipulate heavy things with ease.\u201dWhy, you ask? Let\u2019s back up to seventh-grade science class. \u201cThis right here,\u201d Chris says, snapping at me with a pair of those tongs for emphasis, \u201cis a simple machine.\u201d Common cooking tongs are an example of a third-class lever. The fulcrum (where the arms of the tongs connect) is at one end, the load (what you\u2019re picking up with the tongs) is at the other, and the effort you apply (by squeezing the tongs with your hand) is in the middle. The beauty of a lever is that it multiplies your efforts; a small motion with your fingers creates a larger movement at the end of the tongs. The longer the tongs, the more that movement is multiplied. But it also means less control over precise maneuvering.Imagine trying to maneuver this steak with 16-inch tongs!\nPhoto by Emma Fishman, food styling by Yekaterina BoystovaWhile length is Chris\u2019 first criteria in choosing a pair of tongs, it\u2019s not the only one. \u201cTongs that lock are essential for storage,\u201d he says. (Nobody likes the frustration of an open pair jamming a drawer.) There are three main locking mechanisms on the market\u2014tongs with a pull-tab lock at the fulcrum, tongs with a ring that slides up and down the arms, and tongs with an automatic inner lock governed by dark sorcery that closes or opens depending on if the head is pointed up or down. \u201cThe pull-tab kind is the only one that works,\u201d Chris says. \u201cI don\u2019t mess with the up-down thing. And tongs with the sliding ring? Horrible! The ring is always where you don\u2019t want it to be while you\u2019re cooking.\u201dEssential for pasta tossin\u2019\nMaterial must also be considered. Do you opt for a stainless steel pair or cooking tongs that are silicone- or nylon-tipped? While Chris says there\u2019s an argument to be made for stainless, the nylon-tipped version can be used on non-stick pans, which makes it the better bet if you\u2019re only going to buy one pair. (He says to avoid silicone, which can discolor and crack after repeated exposure to high heat.)Oh, and the non-slip handle? That added bonus ensures he can maintain a controlled grip while maneuvering both the slenderest stalks of asparagus and the heaviest of roasted chickens. And that, my friends, is science.Explore Bon App\u00e9titproductShoppingRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
