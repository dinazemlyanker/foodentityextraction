It wasn\u2019t until later in life that I discovered one of my childhood favorites had a name: Hoppin\u2019 John. As I got older I started to do some research and ask around about how this simple rice and beans dish received its infamous name. Some say the name comes from children \u2018hoppin\u2019\u200a\u2019 around the dinner table; another story tells of a man named John who came \u2018a-hoppin\u2019\u200a\u2019 when his wife took the dish from the stove.\u00a0\u201cWhatever you call it, the combination of stewed beans, salt-cured meat (here I use ham hock or slab bacon), and the added Cajun/Creole flair from the \u2018holy trinity\u2019 of onion, bell pepper, and celery is a quintessential Southern classic. Hoppin\u2019 John is traditionally served on New Year\u2019s Day with collard greens and cornbread, symbols of wealth and prosperity; a bowlful is meant to bring you good luck all year.\u201d \u2014Millie PeartreeAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I made with bacon and didn\u2019t think enough savory and depth of flavor infused so I\u2019m looking forward to the ham hock version. Jenna C. Los Angles, CA3/10/2022While technically the poster is correct, for many years and most people field peas were unavailable. I am picky enough to only use Carolina Gold or Carolina Aromatic rice. I use both smoked belly and pork hocks, using them first to establish a base. I do not use bell peppers as I feel that is a Louisiana addition. Don't over cook your rice!joel pesapaneisle of palms, sc1/18/2022Field Peas are to be used in Hoppin' John--not black eyed peas. The difference is like night and day--like ice cream versus gelato. The overwhelming number of recipes that use black eyed peas would not be tolerated if you were discussing any other ethnic form of cooking, but black American southern food traditions get re-mixed and taken over without nary a backward glance.. You can make spaghetti and meatballs with ramen noodles but is it still a proper spaghetti dish? And you would find no Italian willing to besmirch their grandmother's good name by sharing said \"recipe\".\nThe Possum Hill KidBeaufort, SC1/2/2022Just like my mom made growing upDebutntYoungstown Ohio 1/2/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titDinnerLunchBreakfastEasyBlack-Eyed PeaBeanVegetableHamMeatRiceRice & GrainsNew Year'sSouthernAmericanSoul FoodCajun & CreoleGluten-FreeDairy-FreeNut-FreeRecipes you want to make.
