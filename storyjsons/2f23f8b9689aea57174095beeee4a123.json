Your horoscopes this month will have you seeing into the future (where things are warmer and brighter), but more importantly, into the frying pan. Because the theme is EGGS. Are you a crispy fried egg with a side of nearly burnt toast or a fluffy egg souffl\u00e9? Find out below.Illustration by Oscar Bolton GreenAriesThis month, you\u2019ve got a great deal of focus on your side (for once), so you might find yourself passionately chipping away on a project at home, or even on your home itself. Take advantage of being in your own world while you can, Aries, and don\u2019t feel bad if you aren\u2019t your usual social butterfly self. Take this time for you and consolidate your energy. See where inspiration leads you, which might be to the kitchen, where you can finally hone your poached egg technique. The perfect poach requires a confident hand as you gently drop the egg into a swirling vortex of simmering water. We\u2019re not saying it\u2019s a metaphor, but gaze into the swirling vortex of water yourself and report back on any visions you may or may not have. Either way, you\u2019ll end up with a beautiful, bouncy cloud-like egg\u2014and a new trick up your sleeve. Eggs Benedict anyone?Illustration by Oscar Bolton GreenTaurusYou already have the wardrobe part down, but get ready to go out on the town this month. Everybody wants to make plans to connect with you. You\u2019re going to feel popular\u2014and loved\u2014but most of all, you can find a sense of peace amidst your life in motion. Ignore the craziness at work for a hot second and focus on all of the wonderful people in your life who are there to affirm that you are freaking awesome. Also freaking awesome: Scotch eggs\u2014hard-boiled eggs enveloped in sausage and breadcrumbs\u2014a glamorous midnight snack that will make you feel special after a fun (okay, beer-soaked) evening out. For you, life is about good taste and little pleasures. Or at least that\u2019s what you said when you bought everyone that last round of shots.Illustration by Oscar Bolton GreenGeminiYou\u2019ve got a good stride going in your professional world, which gives you confidence to take the lead in other areas of life. You\u2019ve been putting it off for a while, but you may have to have that difficult conversation with your partner or a close friend. Don\u2019t let your nerve derail you from being compassionate or getting to the point, and you might be surprised how well things smooth out afterward. Sometimes a little friction is what\u2019s needed to reinforce the bond. And for the part of you that does NOT wish to have kind words, dish up some deviled eggs for the devil on your shoulder\u2014the classic finger food that you can customize to your liking, oh indecisive one, with enough fiery paprika to satisfy your mischievous side. Come on, you know you want to.Illustration by Oscar Bolton GreenCancerYou\u2019re especially focused on your career this month, whether you\u2019re pushing towards accomplishing a big dream you\u2019ve envisioned, or alternatively, feeling bored and ready for something new. Either way, it\u2019s time for some creative reinforcement. Renew your excitement for what you do by taking a class, signing up for a webinar, or listening to a motivational podcast. Get inspired! You love being prepared for anything, so set the mood for success by making a delicious quiche, layered with cheese and bacon in a flaky crust. Just slice and go, for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. One less thing to for you to worry about so you can continue your climb to success.Illustration by Oscar Bolton GreenLeoYou seem to be processing a lot this month, turning your usual radiance inward. This is all well and good, Leo, but avoid overcomplicating things by maintaining your focus on the important issues as they arise. This is a significant period for personal growth, but also for romance. Plan a nice evening at your nearest izakaya that involves yakitori, tons of sake, and chawanmushi\u2014the smooth and (usually) savory  Japanese egg custard that\u2019s as dreamy as you are this month. Like you, it stands out against the rest.Illustration by Oscar Bolton GreenVirgoYou\u2019ve got a case of spring fever and you\u2019ll go stir crazy if you don\u2019t get out of the house this month. You\u2019re a crafty one and know that sometimes you\u2019ve got to make your own magic. Go to the movies or bundle up for a long walk in the woods. You\u2019re feeling extra social this month, which is perfect, as your energy will be best spent enjoying the company of others. Do Sunday morning right by grabbing brunch with your friends and order soft-scrambled eggs\u2014expertly fluffy and maybe even with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, Gordon Ramsay-style\u2014the ideal breakfast of champions. You can raise your mimosa glass to that!Illustration by Oscar Bolton GreenLibraYou love being lazy in these last weeks of winter, filling your online shopping cart with summer clothes as you wait for the temperatures to rise. This month is an excellent time to psyche yourself up about creating healthier habits, remembering all of those resolutions that faded in mid-February. Whatever it is you\u2019re planning, get pumped about it and dive all the way in. Between spin class and yoga, you\u2019ll without a doubt be enjoying some hard-boiled eggs\u2014packed with protein and easy to meal prep. And meal prep means you\u2019ve got more time in the week to maximize on the couch. See? Everything comes full circle this month.Illustration by Oscar Bolton GreenScorpioBy nature, you are a deep and private person, but this month, you might feel more willing to come out of your shell. You calendar is packed with playtime, so let loose and enjoy yourself more, as you rightfully should! The heat turns up in your romantic life, presenting yet even more opportunities for enjoyment and communication. You often assume your partner is a mind-reader like you, but not everyone has this gift, so go ahead and tell them what you\u2019re thinking. This whole year is about growth, which means getting out of your comfort zone. You\u2019ll want a custardy omelet with bacon, mushrooms, and ricotta\u2014an epic rendition of your trusty standby that reminds you that good things happen when you are open to change.Illustration by Oscar Bolton GreenSagittariusExpect chill vibes this month, Sag. Everything seems well and good. You recognize that life is a journey and that everything smooths out in time. You\u2019re in the middle of a year-long incubation period, perhaps working on a big project or just trying to figure out what\u2019s next. Despite paralleled uncertainty and excitement, you realize that there is absolutely nothing to worry about, so go ahead, kick your feet up, and allow the creative gears of your imagination to churn. If you\u2019ve never made shakshuka before, now is the time\u2014his supremely flavorful tomato sauce with charred peppers and poached eggs comes together fast in your trusty cast iron skillet. It\u2019s casual and refined at the same time (like you, of course), just don\u2019t forget some crusty bread or pita to soak up the sauce.Illustration by Oscar Bolton GreenCapricornYou\u2019ll be feeling the need to spread your wings and explore this month. We want you following your curious whims wherever possible. Go ahead and plan that weekend road trip or take that aerial silk class you\u2019ve always wanted to try. While you usually don\u2019t stray too far from your comfort zone, you\u2019d be wise to try it this time\u2014you could make some excellent connections that prove to be helpful later. And at the very least, your craving for new experiences will be satisfied. But before returning to business-as-usual, be sure to sub your usual breakfast bagel for an egg dosa, a crispy, savory Indian pancake packed with spice\u2014something new and delicious for a go-getter like you.Illustration by Oscar Bolton GreenAquariusYou normally prefer to breeze through life, however this month is a rare period where you should take things seriously. You might be considering a big investment of some kind, like buying a house. Always trust your instincts, but you may have to loosen your grip on something you\u2019ve been really stubborn about (clawfoot tubs aren\u2019t as common as we wish). But lucky for you, you can always put your innovative spin on anything and call it a masterpiece. While your attention is focused on big matters, you\u2019ll need some comforting crispy fried eggs\u2014no drama, diner-style eggs with runny yolks and flaky salt. Not everything in life needs to be complicated.Illustration by Oscar Bolton GreenPiscesHappy birthday Pisces! You are invigorated by a sense of renewal (and buttercream frosted cake) this month! Confident, radiant, and optimistic, you\u2019re feeling unusually excited to dive into the year ahead. Your right to be enthusiastic is affirmed by all your friends who are there to celebrate you. You are always putting others first (and we love you for it) but this time, it\u2019s your turn. Spoil yourself, Pisces and don\u2019t wait for someone else to do it for you. You are a precious gem deserving of those fancy linen bedsheets you\u2019ve been eyeballing. Plan a getaway, preferably at the spa, where you can unwind and let yourself float. Top it all off with a cheesy egg souffl\u00e9\u2014a divine breakfast that rises up like a cloud to meet you at your level of out-of-this world proportions. As you (and Mae West) always say, too much of a good thing can be wonderful.Catherine O\u2019Neill is an astrologer and writer who is currently mastering poached eggs.
