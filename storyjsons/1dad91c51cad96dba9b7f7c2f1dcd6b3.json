I use the vegetarian substitution of \"1 tablespoon of capers, 1/2 tablespoon of miso, and a dash of soy sauce for the anchovies\" provided by anon, but otherwise make no changes.  I like to serve with sauteed veggies on top, like zucchini, bell peppers, and kale.  It's very filling and makes a ton, you'll have at least 3 more meals' worth of leftovers!MoroAlbuquerque, NM2/21/2022This was a yummy recipe. The toasted walnuts make it creamy and the red pepper and lemon zest give the sauce some complexity. I actually liked the sauce re-heated the next day better than when it was freshly served - something about letting sauces like this rest and re-heating them just brings out all the flavors. I will make this again. OliviaNew York, NY1/8/2022This is great! To make it vegetarian, I sub in 1 tablespoon of capers, 1/2 tablespoon of miso, and a dash of soy sauce for the anchovies.anon12/15/2021I love this recipe so much! I make a little more pasta than called for as there is quite a bit of sauce. MarisaMontreal7/29/2021Made the recipe as written. Loved it! Super creamy and savory. We prepped the pesto in advance to cut down on mealtime work, and it worked wonderfully! AnonymousOxford, MS12/28/2020A delicious creamy without-the-cream pasta recipe! I changed it slightly and added more veggies by braising red onion, a zucchini, capsicum and half the cherry tomatoes, then added a bunch of baby spinach at the end. I also added a small amount of capsicum to the pesto and didn\u2019t use a broiler but instead a frypan. I think because there was more liquid from the tomatoes I didn\u2019t need to add as much olive oil too. AnonymousAustralia 1/20/2020I thought this recipe needed a little something else. I already tend to err on the side of extra for ingredients (eg used a little more tomatoes) but it wasn\u2019t until I served the pasta with a bunch more Parmesan and squeezed the juice of the lemon over it that I actually liked the flavour. Was fairly alright in the end and pretty easy but for the amount of steps involved I  probably wouldn\u2019t make again ! soyabeanbbAustralia12/16/2019Super easy and delicious! Made it with almonds as I had those lying around and I couldn't stop eating the sauce.
