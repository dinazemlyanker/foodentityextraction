Start peeling some winter squash!By Elaheh NozariJanuary 18, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Christina Holmes, Food Styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, Prop Styling by Kaitlyn Du RossFacebookTwitterEmailWelcome to Never Fail, a weekly column where we wax poetic about the recipes that never, ever let us down.I was raised to be suspicious of creamy food, a fact that I blame partly on growing up in a household that adhered to a \u201cheart-healthy\u201d diet, and partly on my sensitive stomach, which straight up rejects anything with heavy cream in it.And that's a shame, because eating a bowl of creamy pasta in your pajamas is one of the only good things about winter. The good news? This winter squash carbonara recipe is every bit as rich, silky, and substantial as a classic alfredo or stovetop mac and cheese, but with no dairy in sight. (Okay, it does involve a little bit of Pecorino at the end, but that kind of cheese doesn't make my stomach hurt, and is totally optional.)You really only need squash, onions, chicken stock, and pasta to make this dish\u2014everything else is a nice-to-have. I know this because I\u2019m an infrequent grocery shopper, and more than once this winter I\u2019ve found myself with nothing in my kitchen but a squash, an onion, and half a carton of chicken stock.This recipe might lack the main ingredient of traditional carbonara (eggs), but it does maintain the spirit of the dish\u2014a velvety, silky texture that I didn\u2019t realize a humble vegetable like winter squash (I like kabocha best) was capable of producing. I know for a fact that kabocha squash (and maybe chicken stock) is responsible for making the sauce so addictive because I have made it multiple times without the called-for pancetta, once without garlic, and another time without sage, but every single time I've used kabocha. And every single time it has had same irresistibly creamy consistency. Kabocha for the win!The only remotely hard part is peeling and cutting the squash, which you should get out of the way at the beginning. (Putting it in the microwave for 30 seconds will soften the skin, making it easier to cut and peel. Who knew?) You\u2019re supposed to start off by heating pancetta and sage in the skillet before anything else happens, but if you don\u2019t have those ingredients you can just cut to the chase and throw in the squash, onion, and garlic. After 8-10 minutes, or when the smell of saut\u00e9ed onions has permeated the room and the fibers of your clothes, add chicken broth, bring it to a boil, then let the whole thing simmer until the mixture looks soft. You want the chicken stock to reduce so that the flavor concentrates, so leave that lid off. (Word to the wise: Don't add salt until the chicken stock has reduced to where you want it, otherwise your sauce will end up too salty.) At this point, your roommates will come out of their rooms and ask what smells so good. Squash sauce!Kabocha squash is the unsung hero of winter vegetables.\nGetty/kittimagesThe key to making this faux carbonara recipe so smooth isn\u2019t cream, eggs, or butter\u2014it's a blender. Once the squash is soft and about half of the broth has boiled away, get out your blender\u2014an immersion blender will work, too\u2014and start pur\u00e9eing the mixture. (I typically work in batches to avoid squash exploding out of my blender, which is a real evening-ruiner.)Season the sauce with salt, give it another buzz, and taste\u2014it's so good that you'll consider eating it on its own, sans pasta. But once you get it bubbling in a skillet, and toss it with al dente pasta and a splash of salty, starchy pasta water, you'll be glad you waited. Look at that! You have successfully turned a kabocha squash into the most luxurious of carbonaras. Serve it in a big bowl with grated Parmesan, and feel a whole lot less sad about winter.Get the recipe:Winter Squash Carbonara with Pancetta and SageView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titNever FailWinter SquashWinterPastaCarbonaraRecipes you want to make.
