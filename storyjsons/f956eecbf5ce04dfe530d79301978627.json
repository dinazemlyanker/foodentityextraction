Cooking down the leftover marinade and incorporating it back into the final dish ensures no flavor goes to waste. Given the high sodium content in both hoisin and gochujang, additional salt probably won\u2019t be needed.Ingredients4 Servings\u2154cup hoisin sauce2Tbsp. gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)2garlic cloves, finely chopped\u00bdtsp. freshly ground black pepper, plus more\u00bctsp. plus \u215b tsp. high-quality balsamic vinegar12lamb rib chops (1\u20131\u00bc\" thick)1bunch scallions1tsp. grapeseed oil or vegetable oilKosher salt2Tbsp. toasted sesame oil3Tbsp. unsalted butter, divided1medium onion, finely chopped1tsp. toasted sesame seedsPreparationStep 1Pur\u00e9e hoisin, gochujang, garlic, \u00bd tsp. pepper, \u00bc tsp. vinegar, and \u2154 cup water in a blender until smooth. Place lamb chops in a baking dish and pour marinade over; turn to coat. Let sit at room temperature at least 15 minutes.Step 2Meanwhile, arrange scallions on a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with grapeseed oil; turn to coat. Season with salt and pepper; set aside.Step 3Heat sesame oil in a large high-sided skillet over medium-high; add 2 Tbsp. butter. Working in 2 batches, remove lamb chops from marinade, letting excess drain back into dish, and cook in a single layer until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer to a platter; set marinade aside.Step 4Add onion to drippings in skillet and cook (still over medium-high), stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Add reserved marinade and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir remaining \u215b tsp. vinegar into sauce and remove from heat.Step 5Drizzle \u00bd cup sauce over lamb chops. Let remaining sauce in skillet cool 1 minute, then transfer to a blender. Add remaining 1 Tbsp. butter and 2 Tbsp. water and pur\u00e9e until smooth. Transfer to a small bowl and set dipping sauce aside.Step 6Wipe out skillet (or use a medium skillet if you prefer) and heat over medium-high. Cook reserved scallions, turning often, until charred in spots, about 3 minutes.Step 7Arrange scallions on platter next to lamb chops and sprinkle sesame seeds over lamb. Serve with reserved dipping sauce alongside.How would you rate Hoisin-and-Balsamic-Glazed Lamb Chops?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (7)Back to TopTriangleI'm confused.  There is at least 20 minutes of preparation AFTER the lamb has been cooked and is resting on a platter.  I can't imagine that the chops won't be cold by that time and probably well into a medium-well state.  Have I missed something here?ColoBillDenver, CO12/17/2021Hi! Chef Dalia here. I made this recipe and I'm commenting here to answer your question. Don't recommend making with chicken but it's great with any cut of beef or even venison.
