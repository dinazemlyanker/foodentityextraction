It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Farewell, sweet princeOnce, in a very formal pitch meeting, Amiel Stanek stood up and started talking in a funny voice, pausing his speech in odd places, and turning what could have been a boring presentation into a performance piece. About three seconds in, I was laughing so hard, as quietly as I could, that I was crying. Tears. My colleagues were secretly filming me. Amiel makes me laugh-cry, he is so funny. Now Amiel is LEAVING us for a new life adventure in Hudson, New York. He\u2019s going to keep writing and doing video for Bon App\u00e9tit, but he\u2019s not going to be sitting across from me, eating hair-health gummies and buying ant farms full of dead ants on Amazon. I\u2019m going to miss that lovable weirdo. The perfect gentleman. The fashion icon. At a going away party at Di Fara in Brooklyn, Amiel was lifted on a chair for the Horah, like it was his bar mitzvah. Christina Chaey made two gallons of banana pudding and served it with the gigantic, human-sized spoon that\u2019s been at Amiel\u2019s desk for years. Adam Rapoport in a cowboy hat and Julia Kramer did an award-winning rendition of \u201cShallow.\u201d This time, Amiel is going to make me cry-cry.What is that picture? Amiel cooking an egg in a sauna for his hilarious video on cooking an egg...every single way. Watch it here.Want this letter before it hits the website?

Every time I talk to him\u2014after a quick weekly summary of the weather in Houston\u2014he\u2019s telling me about some new eating plan he\u2019s following, and what he\u2019s cooking tailored to it. A gluten-free diet => time to experiment with gluten-free pancakes! I\u2019ve learned to stop even trying to suggest Bon App\u00e9tit recipes, he won\u2019t listen. He prefers his cookbooks like he prefers CDs to Spotify, the most beloved being Bobby Flay Fit. Just look at Bobby on that cover. The snug henley. The dish that looks salad-like but is next to some grilled protein. The hint of back deck he appears to be standing on. My father\u2019s favorite recipes are the flatbread, oatmeal breakfast cookies, and quinoa con pollo. Maybe for Father\u2019s Day this year, I\u2019ll get him a henley.An aging caterpillarThe Very Hungry Caterpillar turned 50 years old this week. When I was in kindergarten, I played the chocolate cake in a musical performance of the book. I had to wear all brown (yeek), but I was delighted to be the first junk food the caterpillar ate after all the wholesome fruits and vegetables. It was as if somehow, five-year-old me knew that life wasn\u2019t worth living without chocolate cake. I stand by that sentiment.No commentPumpkin spice SPAM arrived in our office recently. We all gave it a sniff and pass. I just need you to know it exists.Photo by Flashpop/Kraft HeinzSalad what now?In this week\u2019s preordained viral story, Kraft introduced \u201csalad frosting,\u201d which is ranch dressing in a pouch. I have a feeling this is going to be as big of a hit as blue ketchup.Unnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekIs it normal to eat a banana as a snack at 5:30 p.m.? We noticed Alex Delany started peeling open a banana in the late afternoon, and I for one, was concerned. What about dinner? This doesn\u2019t seem like the appropriate hour for a banana, I said. Emily Schultz cackled and pointed her phone at Delany, capturing the moment for posterity and Instagram. Meryl Rothstein said 4:30 was a perfectly fine time for a banana cut into coins with peanut butter. Amanda Shapiro agreed, preferring hers pre-frozen, eaten like a popsicle. \u201cIt\u2019s only weird to eat a banana after the sun goes down IMO,\u201d said Christina Chaey. When Delany mentioned how important it is to get your \u201cdaily fiber intake,\u201d Jesse Sparks made a look of horror and disgust, as if he\u2019d pooped right there in the middle of the office. What do you think?Sort of related: Delany\u2019s new series started this week! He ate \u201cone of everything\u201d at one of New York\u2019s most famous burger spots. Watch it here...but maybe don\u2019t try at home.Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MoreLifestyle30-Something Dinner Parties Are the Best Dinner PartiesBy Amiel Stanek and Lauren SchaefercookingThis Entry-Level Whole Fish Recipe Made Me Who I Am TodayBy Alex BeggscultureCrispy-Gone-Soggy Is the Finest Texture of Food There Is, Fight MeBy Amiel StanekcookingThe Homemade Ranch Dressing I Make More Often Than I Call My MotherBy Amiel StanekRecipes you want to make.
