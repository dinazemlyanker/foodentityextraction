Toast the nuts? Grate the garlic? Here\u2019s the deal.By Alex Beggs and Andy BaraghaniAugust 21, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmail\u201cDid you make this with...a mortar and pestle?\u201d We asked Andy Baraghani, tasting his bright green pesto on glossy pasta a few weeks back. He rolled his eyes. If this were Andy\u2019s Best Pesto recipe, he might have, he told us. But this is BA\u2019s Best Pesto; it\u2019s a classic. It\u2019s made in a food processor, and it\u2019s perfect.Lately, we\u2019ve had some avant garde pesto recipes (see Andy\u2019s miso pesto) and variations on different greens, nuts, and cheeses. Even a chopped pesto, no machinery required. But no regular ol\u2019 basil, pine nuts, and Parm combo for all of us craving simplicity in this complicated, humid world. Thankfully, that is no longer the case. Does a hole in the universe suddenly feel filled? That\u2019s what we thought. Here\u2019s what makes BA\u2019s Best Pesto, well, the best:You don\u2019t need to blanch the basil\u201cWe\u2019re not assholes,\u201d says Andy on behalf of recipe developers everywhere. Blanching will make it brighter green, but you don\u2019t need to do it. If you\u2019re like, nah I really want that Pantone 3539 greenery, here\u2019s a secret from Andy: Sneak a few leaves of spinach in there, watch the color brighten instantly, tell no one. Tell. No. One.But you do need to roast those pine nutsThrow them on a baking sheet for 5-7 minutes in a 350\u00b0F oven, NBD. But the result is huge: a fuller, nuttier flavor to balance the sharpness of the basil. Per Andy the authority: \u201cRoasting activates the oil in the pine nuts and adds depth.\u201dMake it in a food processor, or blender if you wantThe difference is texture. The blender will make a velvety smooth pesto, solid green. The food processor will keep flecks of basil leaves intact. This is an aesthetic decision, or one based on whether you own a food processor or not.The order of operationsInto the food processor go: Nuts first. Grated garlic and cheese. Basil. Then olive oil streamed in. This keeps the basil from getting bruised and browned. (And FYI grating the garlic distributes it garlic better than putting the whole clove in. An important lesson learned from garlic bread.)A note on the best pesto pasta of your lifeIf you\u2019re making this pesto for pasta, to achieve the irresistible glossiness pictured here, add 2 Tbsp. of unsalted butter in a bowl with the pesto before adding pasta and pasta water. It\u2019s not that much butter, and there\u2019s a reason beyond the fact that butter is butter: If the olive oil you used for the pesto is grassy or peppery, and the basil is sharp and peppery, the butter mellows that pep out. When you swirl that first bite of pasta, you\u2019ll be able to taste everything, rather than one note sticking out (extreme basil! Salty cheese! Fiery garlic!). Butter cuts through it all and adds that little something extra that turns regular ol\u2019 pesto into BA\u2019s Best.Get the recipe:BA\u2019s Best PestoThe key is to add the basil at the very end instead of blending everything all at once.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPastaPestoBasilPine NutParmesanRecipes you want to make.
