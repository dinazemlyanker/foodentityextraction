There\u2019s a carb for that.By Carla CicconeMarch 25, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Nadine RedlichFacebookTwitterEmailFeelings, no matter what they are, are always hungry, and pasta, perfected by nonnas who know life, pain, and food, and just want to feed you, is here for all of your feelings. Untold varieties of pasta exist beyond classics like spaghetti and penne, and each serves a different sentiment. Just as a well balanced diet is good for your nutritional health, a well balanced pasta diet is good for your emotional state. So eat pasta, often and a lot, and use this guide to select specific pasta shapes according to your emotional state.Illustration by Nadine RedlichAlfabetoTranslation: alphabetWhen the going gets tough, take it back to elementary school and the ABCs. It\u2019s important and healthy to be able to identify your feelings, to really spell them out. No, really, spell them out...with your food. Alfabeto pasta is like Scrabble for your stomach. Compose some terrible poetry with it, and then eat it.StortiniTranslation: little crooked onesGather round, my little crooked ones. I want to tell you about stortini. You must eat these tiny macaroni when you\u2019re feeling east, west, north or south of normal. Twisted out of shape. Pasta is not meant to right your emotional state, only match it and comfort it.FiliniTranslation: little cat whiskersIf you\u2019ve ever said something along the lines of \u201cI WANT TO EAT YOUR FACE\u201d to an adorable kitten, filini pasta is for you. It\u2019s also for those with imagination because eating filini turns you into a dignified cat detective with a monocle and a penchant for twirling its, you guessed it, little cat whiskers. To be consumed when you are feeling paranoid in a proud way, like you could solve a small crime that happened at your home, such as: which of your two roommates used all of your ridiculously expensive shampoo? Filini is also fine for when you\u2019re feeling like you want to nap for 12 hours during the day and stay up all night chasing shadows.Illustration by Nadine Redlich\u00a0OrecchietteTranslation: little earsLittle ear pasta is for when you need someone to listen to you complain about petit problems, like that weird look a stranger gave you on the street. Did you know him from somewhere? Was there something on your face? Did he just hate the sight of you? Is he actually in love with you? What was his problem? Who cares? Little ears do.ReginetteTranslation: little queensWHERE THE LITTLE QUEENS AT? Fancy IS a feeling. These wavy ribbon noods let everyone, but namely your stomach, know that you rule. As anyone who\u2019s seen The Crown knows, heavy lies THE CROWN, so if the crushing weight of monarchistic pressure is what you\u2019re actually feeling, the cure is still to mangia pasta.Illustration by Nadine RedlichFarfalleTranslation: butterflyPerhaps the most femme of the pasta shapes, eat butterfly pasta when you\u2019re wanting to feel like Mariah Carey but can\u2019t afford to actually feel like Mariah Carey.Capelli d\u2019angeloTranslation: angel hairYou know that feeling when you look up on an overcast day at the exact moment the sun explodes through a patch of cloud, illuminating the sky with golden halo streams so brilliant, you feel like crying and laughing at the same time, and even if you believe in nothing, you swear to God that was GOD looking at you? THAT\u2019S when you eat angel hair and be one with your heavenly self.SorpreseTranslation: surpriseWhen the ennui gets hungry, you reach for the soprese. It\u2019s a small, ruffled pasta, for frivolous whimsy, and looks like tortellini, but is stuffed with...absolutely nothing. Soprese means surprise and the shocker here is just meaningless air. This is the only pasta to eat when filled with chronic dissatisfaction at human existence.Illustration by Nadine RedlichZitiTranslation: macaroni of the brideZiti is eaten at celebrations of holy matrimony, traditionally. Of course, this doesn\u2019t really matter anymore because it\u2019s been stolen by New Jersey, and is now eaten anytime. Eat it when the Sopranos nostalgia hits, or when you are in New Jersey, feeling anything at all.CappellettiTranslation: little hatsLittle hats pasta date back to the Middle Ages, when aristocrats ate them as a luxury (they\u2019re usually stuffed with meat and cheese). These are chichi hats. When you\u2019re eating alone, or with a toddler or a dog (cats are too judgemental), and feeling droll, it is perfectly acceptable to play with your cappelletti (you know the aristocrats wanted to). You are the auteur of your lunch, so why not conclude your meal play by giving the ends of your silverware fancy, edible headwear and then taking it away violently with your teeth.CavatappiTranslation: corkscrewSometimes, you\u2019re just screwed. Like when a bird poops on you and people say \u201cthat\u2019s good luck,\u201d but it\u2019s literally in your eye and you need a tetanus shot. Or when you finally decide to clean under your bed but stub your toe on all the crap you stashed under your bed and immediately give up. Or when your wife leaves you for your best friend. Many different levels of screwed. Embrace it. Eat it.Illustration by Nadine RedlichFregulaTranslation: little fragmentsIt\u2019s happened. You\u2019ve been dumped, sacked, scammed, and need some pasta STAT. Little fragment pasta is for when you\u2019re ready to pick up the shattered pieces of your emotional wasteland, boil them, and eat them.DitaliTranslation: thimblesThimbles protect your fingers from being stabbed when sewing and knitting; let the pasta version do the same for your heart. Use when you\u2019re feeling particularly vulnerable, like after announcing you\u2019re in love with your best friend.RadiatoriTranslation: radiatorA particular pasta feeling, radiatori is for when your heat is broken and you are very cold and also hungry. It will only fix one of those.Illustration by Nadine RedlichAnelliTranslation: little ringsSad no one\u2019s put a ring on it? This pasta pulls double duty as a delicious carb AND a semolina engagement ring. Were these in your SpaghettiOs? Yes, yes they were.MaltagliatiTranslation: badly cutThis is mistake pasta, literally meaning \u201cpoorly cut.\u201d When you bomb a job interview because you lied on your resume but you\u2019re a bad liar in person, fall off your bike while riding on a flat road, or submit a final report to your boss full of spelling mistakes because spell check was off and computers can\u2019t be trusted...you are in the mood for poorly made, but still delicious, dammit, pasta. Maltagliati is a reminder that your mistakes don\u2019t define you. It\u2019s what you\u2019re made of that matters.Illustration by Nadine RedlichNuvoleTranslation: cloudsWhether you find yourself in a natural dream-state or use some THC to get there, make the most of your airy optimism by consuming nuvole pasta. Pasta castles in the air\u2014you\u2019ve looked at clouds that way, right? Then they turned into IRL carbs and you ate them.GemelliTranslation: twinsIt\u2019s important to examine a problem from multiple points of view. When you\u2019re troubled and linear thinking just won\u2019t do, reach for gemelli. The best twins complement each other but bring two very different energies to the table\u2014one good, and one evil, ideally. Put a piece of pasta on each shoulder to drive this point home, grab a mirror, and talk to yourself in different voices while you eat gemelli and sort your ish out.Illustration by Nadine Redlich\u00a0CaramelleTranslation: candyTired: eating a big bowl of candy when you\u2019re sad.Wired: eating a big bowl of candy shaped pasta when you\u2019re sad.PansottiTranslation: potbelliesIs big belly a feeling? Maybe not, but you can feel your big belly while eating big bellies pasta to achieve true inner peace. Pat your tum tum while nom noming these, and become your own personal Buddha.Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
