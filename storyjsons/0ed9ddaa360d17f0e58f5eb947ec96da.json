I Decided to Taste What I Was MissingFor decades I never even considered meat to be food. Then I found myself in Argentina, surrounded by plates full of\u2026 wait, what are these?By Rajesh ParameswaranOctober 11, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Sargam GuptaFacebookTwitterEmailI was in Argentina writing a novel when I decided\u2014after a lifetime as a vegetarian\u2014that I was going to have my first taste of steak. This was my plan: I would invite an acquaintance out for a meal. She would order a steak, I would order a vegetarian pasta or a salad, and she would give me just one bite of her food. And then I would finally know what meat was.The idea had come to me when I couldn\u2019t get my horse to move. I\u2019d taken a day trip to the Pampas, and the stubborn horse I was riding must have sensed I was a New Yorker who had no business riding horses. He slowed until we were far behind everyone else in our group, then turned sideways on the trail and came to a dead stop. I begged and I prodded, but he wouldn\u2019t budge. I had no idea what to do. Finally, I gave up and simply enjoyed the view.It was a nice view. In the field abutting the path was a scattering of muscular cows, with hides of bright ochre and faces white as coconut meat, grazing in the dark grass. When the cows sensed I wasn\u2019t moving, they slowly raised their heads to see what the deal was. They stared at me with small ebony eyes, the curiosity in their faces rising only one or two degrees above indifference. Who is this fellow staring rudely at us while we eat our lunch, who can\u2019t ride a horse and doesn\u2019t have the first idea of how to behave in the presence of dignified animals?Reassured of my insignificance, they returned to their meal. They had a dense, calm, powerful presence. I couldn\u2019t imagine creatures more casually imperious or coolly disdainful, more satisfied with life or sure of their place in it, more indisputable.That was more or less the moment I decided I wanted to try steak.Let me explain further. My whole family are vegetarians, going back generations. It\u2019s for reasons of religion and culture, overlaid more recently with concerns around climate change and factory farming. When I was growing up, if it was vegetarian, it was food, and if it was meat, it wasn\u2019t. It was a habit so deep it was thoughtless. But by the time I\u2019d gotten to Argentina, I\u2019d started thinking about it. Whatever the reasons for my vegetarianism, food is a part of culture, and it felt strange going through life without direct knowledge of what much of the world was eating. So I\u2019d begun, kind of anthropologically, having a taste of chicken here, a bit of fish there. But I\u2019d still never tried steak. Maybe it was an instinctive association of size with moral worth, or maybe it was inherited taboo, but steak was so bloody and thick and smelly and disgusting. It was meat itself, and I never had the slightest interest in it.And then I found myself in the Argentine countryside, unable to get my horse to move, staring at these copacetic, gorgeous cows, so robust, well cared for, and content\u2014at least while I was with them. They were not crowded into feedlots or cruel factories\u2014certainly not yet. It seemed they had entered unwittingly into a noble compact: their premature deaths in exchange for living grandly on these endless plains and making their country famous with their meat. Of course, the endlessness of the plains required to feed them was part of the problem, environmentally speaking. But if ever in my life I was to have a taste of steak, just to know what it was, then perhaps it ought to be safely far from home, here in this place where the cows had the aura of minor gods. The idea thrilled me.My first attempt was a flop. I invited a tourist I\u2019d just met and found a restaurant on the internet. The bite she gave me was a chewy little nub that barely tasted like anything. But after talking with local friends, I concluded that this didn\u2019t count: I\u2019d chosen the wrong restaurant and gone with the wrong person. So I decided to do it again and do it right.This time I invited Pola Oloixarac, a brilliant, enthusiastic, and somewhat dramatic Argentine writer. We\u2019d go to lunch at one of the best parillas in Buenos Aires on my last day of the trip. \u201cIt is an honor,\u201d she would say later, \u201cto introduce you to the meat of my country.\u201dPola arrived at La Cabrera in a black dress and dark eyeliner. After kissing me on the cheek, she began charming first the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 and then our boyish waiter, and quickly the two men were grinning as they escorted us to a table by a window.I explained my plan once more for good measure: a salad for me and just one bite of her steak. Pola nodded slightly. She stared with great focus and an air of appreciation at the menu, and I sensed already something feeble about my plan\u2014about the presumption that I would be the one to make the plan\u2014in the face of her intensity.\u201cRaj,\u201d she finally said, leaning forward, with confidential urgency. \u201cWe will order the steak, of course. That\u2019s why we are here. But there are things on this menu. Wonderful things. Things you will never find in New York or even anywhere else in Buenos Aires. Very Argentine things. I think we should order those things too.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d I needed to clarify myself. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m only up for one bite of steak. If there\u2019s something more you would like, please feel free. But I\u2019m not used to eating meat, to say the least. And I have to catch a flight in a few hours\u2014I don\u2019t know how my stomach will react.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Pola settled back into her chair. \u201cJust a taste. You don\u2019t have to finish everything.\u201d\u201cBut do we really want to waste an animal?\u201dThe wine had arrived, and I was sipping with nervous frequency because Pola\u2019s insinuations were worrying me.\u201cLook,\u201d she showed me the menu. \u201cThey have mollejas here. I don\u2019t think you can leave Argentina without knowing mollejas.\u201d\u201cIf you want those, maybe you should get the half order, just for yourself?\u201d I parried.\u201cAnd we also have to get morcillas. They are just wonderful. And then the steak, of course. And you also wanted a salad.\u201d\u201cPola,\u201d I said. \u201cThis is starting to sound like an awful lot of food. Your instincts are generous, but I\u2019m just here for one taste of steak. Please don\u2019t order anything if you\u2019re expecting me to eat it.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Raj,\u201d she smiled, but I was, and I sensed that I should be. The waiter arrived. My Spanish wasn\u2019t quick enough to follow all that she told him.The salad came first. Massive and mounded with grains, it alone would have been sufficient lunch for two people in my world. It was followed quickly by what I have recollected were the mollejas. These were two charred, oblong objects, about the size and shape of mangoes or fists. To my nose they smelled noxious and intensely animal. In fact, the smell made me feel a little ill.Pola began sawing one of them in half. She took that half and plopped it on a plate. She pushed it in front of me.My heart began to beat faster and my neck grew warm. I couldn\u2019t stand the smell. \u201cPola,\u201d I said, \u201cI can\u2019t eat all that.\u201d\u201cJust have what you like,\u201d she said warmly.All I had wanted was to take one step across the line\u2014put one toe across, really, to become slightly acquainted with the range of human cuisine and then put this behind me. But I couldn\u2019t become a new person entirely. And that seemed what would have been required of me to eat the thing that was reeking on that plate.What had begun as a limited experiment was spinning out of control. But I reminded myself that I was still responsible. In theory I believed that if an animal were going to die for your meal, it was better to eat every part of it. And my aversion to the food was matched by my reluctance to waste any kind of food: My immigrant habits were at war with one another. And maybe there was also a wish to impress Pola, who was absolutely sincere in her enthusiasm. When you involve other people into the transgressing of your boundaries, you can\u2019t always control how the story unfolds.\u201cI\u2019ll have a taste,\u201d I whispered. I felt the blood leaving my extremities, my head getting lighter, as I said this.\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.\u201cI\u2019ll have a little taste,\u201d I said, less weakly, gathering my resolve. The molleja, in cross section, seemed to be composed of a layer of charred skin around a pasty interior. \u201cBut before I taste it, please tell me, what is this I\u2019m about to eat?\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s mollejas,\u201d Pola said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you say it in English. Hmm.\u201d She struggled for a moment. Then her big eyes brightened. \u201cOh!\u201d She patted her sternum. \u201cDo you know the heart?\u201dI stared back in horror. \u201cYes, Pola.\u201d My own heart was sinking. \u201cYes, I know the heart.\u201dBut this was the half order, and there were two of them. In what world did an order of heart come with four hearts?\u201cOh, no, these are not hearts,\u201d she clarified. \u201cBut you know. Near the heart. There are, what do you call them in English? Ah. There are glands.\u201dGlands? Is that really what she meant? Glands were things filled with hormones that swelled up when you got sick. You could eat those? I lost myself for a moment: Was it better to eat glands or hearts? It seemed too generous to hearts to say that they were better; but right now it seemed indisputable that glands were somehow even worse.\u201cYou look frightened,\u201d Pola said, with sudden sensitivity.\u201cWell, yes.\u201d My mouth was tacky and dry. \u201cIn fact, I am frightened. But I guess that\u2019s kind of why I came here. I\u2019m going to do it.\u201dStruggling not to smell the thing, I used a serrated knife to slice off a sliver as carefully as possible with my unsteady hands. The room receded to a buzzing haze. My arm moved, the fork came to my lips, my mouth opened and\u2026\u2026the molleja simply melted on my tongue. It was incredibly delicate, airy and light; at the same time it was somehow rich and sort of creamy. It was in every way different from what I thought the smell had suggested. The word delicacy flashed through my mind, and it had new meaning now. Here was something truly delicate and rare. Here was a great delicacy.I\u2019d done it. I\u2019d had my taste. So now what was I doing having another?Next the morcillas arrived. These were dark oblongs with little flecks in them. The smell was complex, deep, unfamiliar. \u201cMorcilla,\u201d Pola explained. \u201cYou take some on a piece of bread. And you add chimichurri.\u201dI asked again, although I should have known better by now: \u201cBut what is it?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026 Well, do you know blood?\u201d\u201cOh, Pola,\u201d I said. \u201cYes, I know blood. You\u2019re telling me that this solid thing. . . \u201d\u201cOh, no,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not blood. Not exactly. It\u2019s blood with grease.\u201dI guffawed in grief. I vowed to ask no more questions for fear of more answers. I would just get it over with. I scooped a bit of the moist and crumbly dark matter onto a piece of bread. I spread it down and topped it with chimichurri, which had finely diced mango, cucumber, and cilantro. I brought it all to my mouth and sank my teeth in.How can I describe it? The taste was complicated and layered, almost as if it had been flavored with cloves and other spices\u2014savory but with a slight sweetness. There seemed something vaguely Indian about it. It was simply one of the most interesting things I had ever put on my tongue.I hung my head down and took deep breaths. Somewhere in my veins I felt the molecules of my body transforming.\u201cMy dear, you\u2019re frightened again.\u201d\u201cI just need a minute,\u201d I said.\u201cYes, that\u2019s a good idea. Let\u2019s pause. Let\u2019s take a minute.\u201dI was not frightened now; I was moved. A beast had been killed, one of those great orange cows of the countryside; and the people working in this kitchen had paid attention to it, to all of it, even the oddest parts, and made this art of it. It was a primal\u2014but a very human\u2014thing. It moved me.I drank more Malbec and jettisoned my plan to take just a small taste of everything. The steak had arrived by now, sitting in what appeared to be a pool of blood; it was chewy and boring in comparison to the other marvels on the table. I kept eating everything, because I was amazed by the food, and felt some responsibility to the cow\u2014half of which, virtually, had been served to us (there was also pig, I realized later; the morcillas are made from pig)\u2014to not waste a bit of its sacrifice.There are things of the mind and things of the body, and food is somehow both. It\u2019s an edible language, with its own grammar and local meanings, taught to us by our families. Like language, it\u2019s processed sensually in our mouths. Then one day we look around and want to learn what other people are eating. We realize food is created and contingent. What is incomprehensible can become intelligible; or what is familiar, strange. We can discover new appetites, hidden somewhere in our bodies, and someone can teach us another way of eating.Halfway through our meal, Pola sent everything back to the kitchen to be reheated on the grill because one could do that here, if one knew to ask for it. \u201cThis way you can taste things both lightly cooked and medium.\u201d (There is an expertise involved in being a good diner, I saw, as much as is in being a cook.) In a few hours I would be back in New York, trying to reassume my vegetarian habits. This meat was knowledge that could not be unlearned, but I knew it would be less meaningful, less sustainable, without this richness of context, and my particular guide. How could I order glands in Manhattan and expect them to compare? But there with Pola, I kept eating until I simply couldn\u2019t hold any more. And on the plane home that night, I slept soundly, without even a murmur from my stomach.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCultureRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
