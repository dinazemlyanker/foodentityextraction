See our past recommendations here!Growing up, the words \u201cherbal medicine\u201d sent shivers down my spine. They brought to mind the intensely bitter herbs my Chinese relatives cajoled me into taking, sick or not, when I wasn\u2019t able to squirm away. I was as grossed out by them as I was convinced of their efficacy; anything that tasted that bad had to be good for you.Christine Buckley\u2019s Plant Magic: Herbalism in Real Life is helping me reset my relationship with good-for-you plants. Her recipe for medicinal tea calls for the reader to add honey, sugar, or milk if desired, because \u201cmedicine can be a treat, not a punishment.\u201d Plant Magic is a crash course, a field guide, and a reference primer sure to delight those who are already curious about the healing properties of plants. Thankfully for those of us who don\u2019t know nettle from linden, it\u2019s also a cookbook\u2014and one with street cred.Before devoting herself to herbalism, Buckley cooked at New York favorites Prune and Torrisi, baked at Detroit\u2019s Sister Pie, and worked as a food stylist for a decade. (Catch her clipping dandelion greens with a pair of Joyce Chen scissors on page 7\u2014a staple in every food stylist\u2019s arsenal.) I am lucky to count Buckley as a friend, and while she\u2019s cooked me many healthful meals, it has never come at the expense of deliciousness. Even as she throws around terms like \u201cdemulcent\u201d and \u201canticatarrhal,\u201d you can tell that her herbalism practice is layered on top of a deep attention to food, flavor, and the pleasure that comes from eating things that taste good.Buckley lays the groundwork for an at-home herbalism practice, explaining what it is (a system of healing supported by plants and food), what it is not (a new thing invented by white people with blogs), and how it can coexist with Western medicine (drink your red clover tea and get a flu shot). She provides instructions for making balms, ointments, and facial steams, but the real highlights are the recipes for things you can eat and drink. There\u2019s garlicky chicken stock to bolster the immune system, a cinnamon latte to increase circulation and calm stomach cramps, and a rose petal toast spread so thickly with cultured butter that you leave \u201ctoothmarks after a bite.\u201d These recipes, written by someone who speaks the language of food, wouldn\u2019t be out of place in a cookbook that had nothing to do with herbalism. With plants that taste this delicious, you just might forget they\u2019re also good for you.Buy it: Plant Magic, $24 at AmazonAll products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
