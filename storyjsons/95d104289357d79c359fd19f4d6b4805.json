Use broccoli stems in any recipe that calls for florets; their crunch provides a nice textural contrast. Leave the peels on the garlic cloves so they steam and become creamy inside their skins when roasted. If you don\u2019t have ricotta, mix the mashed roasted garlic into mayonnaise instead.Ingredients6 servings 1baguette, sliced \u00bd\" thick on a diagonal (about 12 slices)6Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided1head of broccoli, stem peeled, stem and florets chopped into \u00bd\" pieces1head of garlic, cloves separatedKosher salt1Tbsp. honey1Tbsp. white wine vinegar\u00bdtsp. crushed red pepper flakes1\u00bdcups fresh ricottaFreshly ground black pepperPreparationStep 1Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 400\u00b0.

Turned out well and despite some bewildered looks, people loved it.Kurt S.Vancouver, BC12/27/2021Such a great Monday night meal. Super easy to make, yet hardy enough to feed the whole family. KGScottsville, Va8/24/2021This is a go to for parties and celebrations. It\u2019s easy to swap out broccoli for other veggies as well to add variety. Love it Eat it!TempegalPhoenix, AZ5/29/2021I really enjoyed eating this. The honey/vinegar drizzle really compliments all of the flavors so nicely. I liked the drizzle so much that I separated half of my ricotta and mixed in the drizzle before spreading on toast for a portion of my baguette slices. Will definitely make again.Kristine WSan Diego, CA3/17/2021I used plain greek yogurt rather than ricotta--that's what I had on hand. Simply fabulous.Cath HatSacramento, CA1/1/2021So delicious! I served sprinkled with minced red bell pepper on top and had extra ricotta/garlic that I used as a side dip with an arrangement of red bell pepper slices around the rim. It is a beautiful appetizer, especially for Christmas with the colors! All I can say is it was the hit off the night! Everyone loved it!Margaret447Massachusetts 10/11/2020These turned out great! I made the toasts with a super stale baguette under the broiler in my oven, I also did not add any oil while toasting them. These were a hit at happy hour, I will definitely make again.AnonymousSan Francisco5/12/2020Super good! I brushed the bread with the oil, and made sure to flip the slices after baking for 5 minutes, depending on your bread it might bake much faster so keep an eye on it! The hot honey sauce paired with the garlic ricotta is inspired. Definitely double up on the honey sauce!raulduke055/6/2020This was soooo delicious! I accidentally kept my toasts in the oven too long so they were hard enough to chip a tooth and these were STILL a huge hit. Easy enough (mashing the garlic is annoying but totally worth it) and will definitely need to make more of that hot honey for dipping! Next time I might try to microplane a small clove of fresh garlic into the ricotta to give it a bit of a garlicky kick. And will definitely take another commenter's suggestion to try with brussels sprouts! YUM! AnonymousIndianapolis, IN9/21/2019The two reviews on this recipe that aren't 5-star seem to be centered on having bought low-quality ricotta  -- but this is a hit either as a party app or a full blown dinner if you use a bigger slice of toast. I've made it both ways several times and they're gobbled up. The flavors go so well together and roasted brocolli is a dream. For the dinner-sized spin use a softer bread to toast up -- or else it may get too crunchy and be a bit of a pain to bite into!AnonymousHouston, TX8/5/2019I wanted to like this. Even with the garlic (which i couldnt get to mash and had to chop even after over cooking) the ricotta didnt taste like anything but watered down milk. The broccoli is good as expected, and the hot honey sauce was very good, but the ricotta's blandness just couldnt be overcome.AnonymousMichigan5/7/2019Ugh, I love this recipe. Made it for two holiday parties and even dared to take it home to my family's Christmas Eve (it's sacred, new recipes are not often welcomed). Total hit everywhere I went, quick and easy to put together and the hot honey is an added surprise. Also looks cuteAnonymousBrooklyn, NY4/2/2019This was gorgeous. The garlic in the ricotta is a game-changer! Will be trying this with Brussels sprouts as well. Love the hot honey!AnonymousCalifornia3/14/2019Perfectly Putrid. Much like the game it went with. I make some mean vegan crostini cocotions this was the worst!Seattle WA2/4/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titToastAmericanBroccoliVegetableRicottaCheeseFallStarterSnackVegetarianNut-FreeHealthyishRoastLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
