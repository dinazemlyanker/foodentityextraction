We found 125\u00b0 to be the sweet spot, but adjust in intervals of 5\u00b0 to try to find the perfect texture for you. Read more about what sous vide cooking is, and see how to cook anything sous vide with step-by-step photos here.Ingredients2 servings11-pound skinless, boneless salmon filletKosher salt1tablespoon coarsely chopped dill1teaspoon finely grated lemon zest\u00bdteaspoon crushed red pepper flakes1tablespoon extra-virgin olive oilSpecial EquipmentA sous vide machine; a 1-gallon vacuum-sealable or resealable plastic bagPreparationStep 1Clip (or stand) sous vide machine to a tall, large pot. Fill pot with warm water to height according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions (keep in mind that fish when added will cause water to rise).Step 2Season salmon with salt. Mix dill, lemon zest, and red pepper flakes in a small bowl to combine, then rub all over fish. Place salmon and any spices that fall off into bag and pour in oil.Photo by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Anna BillingskogStep 3Vacuum-seal or partially close resealable bag, getting as much air out as possible to keep bag from floating, and place in water bath. If using a resealable plastic bag, push down into water to submerge (this will push more air out of the bag) and fully close. To ensure proper cooking, contents of the bag need to be completely submerged in water. Turn on machine and heat water to 125\u00b0.Step 4Using a small clip, secure top edge of resealable bag to rim of pot, positioning it opposite the machine\u2019s water outlet; as the water circulates, it will help keep the bag submerged. If using a vacuum-sealed bag, you may need to set a small plate on top to prevent floating. Cook salmon, maintaining water bath at 125\u00b0, 1\u00bd hours. Remove bag from water bath. Remove salmon from bag and serve as desired.Step 5Do Ahead: Salmon can be cooked in water bath 4 days ahead. Keep sealed in bag and chill, or freeze up to 1 month. Enjoy cold or reheat with sous vide machine at 100\u00b0 until warmed through, about 1 hour, before serving.How would you rate Sous Vide Salmon with Lemon and Dill ?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkExplore Bon App\u00e9titSalmonFishSeafoodLemonCitrusFruitDillHerbs & SpicesMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreeKetoDinnerRecipes you want to make.
