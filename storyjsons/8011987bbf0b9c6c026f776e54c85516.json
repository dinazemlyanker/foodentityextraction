But when it's piled on top of garlic-rubbed, ricotta-spread toast, it's even better. While we love mild, small cannellini beans, any kind of white canned bean (or even chickpeas!) would work great here. Just be sure they're not \"low-sodium\" or you'll be setting yourself up for an under-seasoned situation. Buy full-fat ricotta\u2014it's creamier and flavorful than its low-fat counterparts. And once you've piled the beans on the bread, don't leave any of that mustardy, vinegary dressing behind: Drizzle it over your toasts to take full advantage of its zingy punch.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Dijon mustard1tsp. freshly ground black pepper\u00bdcup extra-virgin olive oil, divided4scallions8oz. sugar snap peas\u00bdcup dill sprigs114.5-oz can cannellini, navy, or gigante beans41\"-thick slices crusty bread1garlic clovePreparationStep 1Using a spatula, mix 1\u00bd cups ricotta and \u00bd tsp. salt in a medium bowl to break apart the curds until ricotta is smooth and spreadable. Don't be afraid to get aggressive. Finely grate zest of half a lemon into ricotta and stir to combine.Step 2Cut lemon in half and squeeze juice into a large bowl. Whisk in 2 Tbsp. white wine vinegar, 2 tsp. Dijon mustard, 1 tsp. salt, and \u00be tsp. pepper. Whisking constantly, slowly stream in \u00bc cup olive oil until dressing thickens slightly and no longer looks oily. You want to add the oil gradually so that your mixture will be creamy and emulsified.Step 3Trim  4 scallions and slice thinly crosswise. Add to bowl with dressing and stir to combine.Step 4Trim ends of 8 oz. sugar snap peas and pull off and discard the strings that run along their seams if they seem tough (you can use your fingers if a knife seems intimidating). Cut snap peas on a diagonal into \u00bd\" pieces (about the size of your beans) and add to bowl.Step 5Finely chop \u00bd cup dill sprigs and add to bowl.Step 6Drain and rinse 14.5 oz. cannellini, navy, or gigante beans in a fine-mesh sieve, then add to bowl with dressing. Toss until well coated. Taste and adjust seasoning, adding more salt if needed.Step 7Cut 4 slices of crusty bread in half (this just makes the whole thing easier to eat). Heat 2 Tbsp. olive oil a large skillet over medium until shimmering, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to low. Cook 4 slices of bread in a single layer until golden brown and crisp on the underside, 5\u20137 minutes (it will seem like a while\u2014be patient). Transfer bread fried side up to a plate so that it stays crispy. Repeat with remaining 2 Tbsp. oil and 4 slices of bread. (Why only fry one side of the bread? The side that gets the topping needs to be sturdy enough to support the cheese and vinaigrette without sogging out, but the flip-side can stay soft and easy to eat\u2014it's the best of both worlds.)Step 8Rub the fried side of each slice of bread with 1 garlic clove; season with a little more salt.Step 9Divide ricotta mixture among toasts. Spoon peas and beans over. Don't leave any vinaigrette behind: Divide any leftovers among toasts.Step 10Serve and enjoy!How would you rate Dilly Beans and Peas on Ricotta Toast?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (10)Back to TopTriangleThis recipe is amazing! My husband and I love it!! This dish is so flavorful and has great texture! We\u2019ll  be making this often! Mandi San Diego, CA12/30/2020This recipe is so flavorful and versatile. Lemon and dill are a great flavor profile that could easily be applied to any fresh vegetable and bean combo. I perps ally like the recipe as described. Keeps well in the fridge for several days (cooking bread separate).laurenmjacobsonDetroit, MI11/24/2020Damn good! I wondered if the peas were meant to be blanched but it doesn't need it. Keeps well for leftovers the next day - just keep the ricotta separate to the peas and bean mixture. So smart to top it up on the crispy side of the bread! I find the ratio of ricotta mixture a bit small compared to the peas and beans. The peas and beans are yummy, you could easily eat that alone as a salad.rookieAustralia7/30/2020Thus recipe is excellent! I used red kidney beans and Basil and dry Flax seed taost - divine. The dry garlic rub is key JenniLeighToronto Canada 6/10/2020I make this at least once a month! Besides the toasts, I throw the beans/peas on salads, cottage cheese, quinoa, or just eat it alone. So good!GraceedenDelray Beach4/20/2020This recipe was so good!Anonymous1/11/2020Swapped sugar snap peas with blanched green beans and it turned out great! AnonymousChicago8/11/2019Delicious! A perfect summer dish. Substituted cream cheese since I\u2019m not a big fan of ricotta, and it was excellent. AnonymousNew York7/13/2019Refreshing, crunchy, *almost* no stovetop - ideal summer meal! A little heavy on the mustard for my taste, but all good. Subbed in garlic scapes for the scallions and was not disappointed!AnonymousBrooklyn, NY7/3/2019OMG! Delicious.quick.pretty for company too.
