It\u2019s a blend of sugar, citric acid, and powdered dried strawberries and cherries. \u201cIt\u2019s a natural version of Kool-Aid,\u201d he says of the tangy-sweet booze-free beverage. \u201cI serve it to my pop-up dinner guests in individual powder packets to stir for themselves as an exercise in destigmatizing Black food traditions.\u201dIngredients8\u201310 Servings2oz. freeze-dried strawberries   (about 3 cups)1.25 oz. freeze-dried cherries (about 1 cup)1cup sugar1Tbsp. plus 1\u00bd tsp. citric acidPinch of kosher saltPreparationStep 1Process strawberries, cherries, sugar, citric acid, and salt in a food processor until finely ground, about 1 minute.Step 2Pour 10 cups water into a large pot  or bowl.

I love Kool-aid but never drink it anymore because it's basically colored sugar water. The recipe seemed a bit complicated because of needing to strain it but it's well worth the effort to remove the seeds. But, this is no Kool-aid. It is sooo much better. It's more like a delicious, fresh tasting Hawaiian Punch, without the corn syrup and artificial additives. I will be making this again. I also bought other freeze dried fruits to try different variations. I think this would make a great base for a summer spritzer or a shot of hard stuff like Vodka or Rum if you want to spice it up.\n\nTo answer the person below, weigh the powders based on the measurements given. (2oz and 1.25oz) RobbieKPennsylvania6/23/2020I see the freeze dried strawberries & cherries already available as a powder.  Can you say how much powder this would translate to?  It looks amazing!\nartichokesMedway, MA6/11/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titPitcher DrinkDrinks AllPunchCold DrinkSoul FoodAmericanStrawberryBerryFruitCherryStone FruitSummerEasyQuickDrinksNonalcoholicJuneteenthFourth Of JulyMemorial DayLabor DayRecipes you want to make.
