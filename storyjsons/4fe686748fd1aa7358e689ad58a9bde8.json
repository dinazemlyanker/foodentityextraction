And when that happens, the easiest tasks feel super hard\u2014including cooking. The last thing we want to do is exert energy in the kitchen (yes, even food editors know when it's time to step away from the stove). These are the foods that we're maybe a little bit embarrassed to admit we rely on for sustenance when all we really want to do is sit in bed and watch movies.Sleeve of saltines, salami, cutting board, ginger ale. \u2014Adam Rapoport, editor in chiefI keep bone broth in the freezer so that when I'm sick I have it to warm up with miso stirred in. \u2014Anna Stockwell, senior food editorWhen I'm sick and definitely not going out to the grocery store anytime soon, I make a big bowl of oatmeal. It's soothing to eat, nutritious, and can act as a base for anything I have lying around. Sometimes I'll go savory with kimchi and avocado, sometimes I'll add dried fruit and a big dollop of peanut butter. Every time I eat in bed, because that's what being sick is about after all. \u2014Aliza Abarbanel, editorial assistant, HealthyishBanana bread oatmeal is definitely a cure for the common cold.\nPhoto by Alex LauWhen a cold knocked me out for several days this winter, I made the following soup on repeat: Canned broth with a little miso stirred in, mixed frozen vegetables (which I keep in my freezer for fried rice and sick meals like this one), and frozen dumplings. It was soothing to eat, easy to make, and didn't require a run to the store, meaning I never even had to change out of my pajamas. \u2014Meryl Rothstein, features editorWhen I'm sick, I rely on something that I would call \"congee-adjacent.\" Cook rice for longer than you are supposed to with a bunch of water. Add to a bowl with fish sauce, peanuts, Sriracha. MEASURE NOTHING! \u2014Carey Polis, digital directorIf I have chicken broth on hand, I love to whisk an egg in a small bowl, then into simmering broth for the quickest ever Stracciatella. A little bit of parm and black pepper to finish and then it's back to Netflix. \u2014Molly Baz, senior food stylistI feel like I always get sick when I NEED to go food shopping, so I usually make what's in my fridge: Scrambled eggs, fried bread, and tons of hot sauce all over them to clear the sinuses. \u2014Emily Schultz, associate social media managerCrack, whisk, cook, done.\nPhoto by Alex LauI love this Masala chai, but I add in some fresh turmeric along with the ginger, and use honey instead of maple syrup. \u2014Claire Saffitz, senior food editorI eat frozen bananas smeared with nut butter whenever I feel feverish. Or whenever I feel anything, tbh.  \u2014Amanda Shapiro, editor, HealthyishWhen I had the flu this season, all I could eat was buttered cinnamon-raisin toast and peeled oranges. When I'm getting over a stomach thing, it's buttered rice with parm. And when I am getting over a hangover, popcorn. \u2014Carla Music, food directorButtered egg noodles, sometimes mixed with Better Than Bouillon-ed broth, is a standby. Or those tiny pastas, like pastina, with a little butter. I am not above a can of Campbell's chicken noodle soup. \u2014Alyse Whitney, associate web editorI make myself weird oatmeal concoctions with whatever is in my pantry. I've made oatmeal with chicken broth instead of milk or water, oatmeal with a sweet potato, and, most recently, oatmeal with a can of baby corn. I'm embarrassed to admit that it was delicious (and if I learned anything, it's to add a can of water chestnuts too). \u2014Elaheh Nozari, e-commerce editorExplore Bon App\u00e9titGet WellHealthyishRead MoreLifestyleThe Healthyish Guide to Feeling Better AlreadyGallery13 SlidesBy The Healthyish TeamRecipes you want to make.
