Packed with herbs and a few heavy-hitting spices, the golden brown savory cake is first crisped in a skillet for optimal craggy edges, then finished in the oven until cooked through. To make it a meal, pair a wedge with a simple salad of cucumber, radishes, and quick-pickled red onion.\u00a0All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Season with more pepper.How would you rate Big Baked Falafel Cake With Cucumber Salad?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (16)Back to TopTriangleI thought this came out really well! My advice would be to use the processor carefully. Keep it chunky and the texture will be more crumbly. But I have to say that the yogurt sauce needs tahini. That's just a necessary part of anything called felafel. Steve Miami 3/25/2022This is definitely a savory bean cake with falafel seasoning, rather than a falafel proper. That being said, it was easy, quick cooking, and delicious. I'll be adding it to my weeknight meal rotation. As others mentioned, don't over-process the ingredients in the food processor, otherwise the texture will be too dense. I cooked mine in a well seasoned cast iron pan, and had no problems with it sticking, or burning. Served with sriracha, it scratched the falafel itch, without having to make a big mess frying them. The Morning Star3/22/2022Wow, this was delicious! The felafel cake was perfect tasting, even if it didn\u2019t come out in one piece: crisp and flavorful. The salad and yogurt were also very good, with the pickled onions mild and the dressing tart. Very good weeknight recipe!Kate LawlessDeerfield, MA3/19/2022I really wanted this to work, but it did not. Bottom was close to burned and the top stayed damp. I did get it out of the pan in almost one piece and tried to flip it and bake the top side down, but  Ididn't have  a lot of luck there.\nI doubled the spices, but it was sorely lacking in taste. I've had the real falafel so maybe I was expecting too much. I do wish EPI could rework this recipe and try again. It has a lot of potential, but not as written.TerryDes Moines3/17/2022My husband really liked this, and the flavor was good, but I am going to have to experiment if I try this again. The cake completely fell apart when I tried to take it out of the pan, and the texture was dry. I added tahini to the yogurt sauce and tomatoes to the salad. I saved the leftovers, so its was worth making, but it needs some improvement. nilssonsBoston, MA3/15/2022The flavor of this is nice (though, I pretty much doubled all the spices). I also really enjoyed the salad and yogurt (I also added tahini). I do have to agree with some of the other reviews - mine turned out dense and mushy. I might have over-hydrated the mixture or over-blended the chickpeas. If I make this again, I'm going to use dried, soaked chickpeas instead of canned, as I was hoping for a fluffier texture. SashaJersey City, NJ3/14/2022All in all I liked this better than frying small falafel and felt it was a fun presentation.  I flipped my falafel cake after pan frying it, it was almost burnt but not quite. I would either reduce the heat or flip it after 4 vs 5 minutes  next time. Flippimg it helped get uniform crispiness and avoided the soggy cake that some other reviewers have noted. I used the sumac sauce from Jerusalem which was great. Alyssa D.Carson City, NV3/14/2022Loved it!  Had no coriander so substituted for mint and it worked beautifully!  Next time I will flip the cake once it's out of the oven and fry off, so it's got an even crisper outer. Tammy 3/13/2022Found it dry, and had to add a lot more seasoning/spice than what the recipe called for. I wonder if another egg would have helped. AnonymousAustin3/12/2022To JIL2 - I did not see \"soap\" on the ingredient list, so I do believe it is an optional addition\n\nThat being said, you are probably genetically predisposed to disliking the cilantro taste, and, shocking as it may be, the vast majority of people find it a refreshing and light herbal addition to many dishes. Please take care to limit your personal consumption and avoid it in your falafel. Soap BubbleMesopotamia 3/11/2022Perfect weeknight dinner! whole thing can come together in 30min and the salad and sauce round it out very nicely.AnonymousWilton, CT3/10/2022Mine burnt on bottom and stayed mushy everywhere else. Cooking it on stovetop now and going to flip like a frittata to brown both sides. Next time I think I\u2019ll just make regular falafel balls.AnonymousSan3/9/2022Loved this, although it stuck a little to the pan. Added tomatoes to the salad. LexStaten Island, NY3/9/2022I HATE CILANTRO --- NOT FOND OF SOAP IN MY FOOD...I SUBSTITUTE THE SAME AMOUNT OF PARSLEY FOR CILANTRO AND, DEPENDING ON WHAT I AM MAKING, HAVE USED CELERY LEAVES --- JUST NOT WITH THE SAME MEASUREMENT...JIL2EL CAJON, CA3/8/2022I have a spouse who hates cilantro.
