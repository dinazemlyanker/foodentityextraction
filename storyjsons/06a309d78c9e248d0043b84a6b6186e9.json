The Ray Donovan actor is trying to teach his sons\u2014Sasha, 10, and Kai, 9\u2014how to make sushi, but they always end up covered in rice. \u201cHolding a child\u2019s attention once he\u2019s got rice stuck all over his fingers, it ain\u2019t easy,\u201d he admits with a laugh.Read on to see what else the Isle of Dogs star is cooking, the prized kitchen possession he has to keep away from his kids, and what weird trio of foods he\u2019d want to eat forever.What\u2019s a typical meal like in the Schreiber household?Most of the food that I make is designed for boys, so it\u2019s tricky. One of our go-to meals is just marinating drumsticks, which we really love to do because it\u2019s finger food. I mix together olive oil, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, black pepper, and red chile flakes in a bowl with the drumsticks around 2 p.m. and pop it in the fridge. By the time the boys are done with their homework, you just bake them at 350\u00b0 until crispy, about 40 minutes. Then I serve with broccoli and rice. We also love making pasta, and we\u2019re trying to master sushi. We\u2019re not really good at it yet, but we\u2019ve been practicing a lot. The hard part is the rice though.How do you cook the rice?I cook it in a pot, and I do the sort of basic Jasmine rice instructions. Sometimes that simmer time gets messed up, because I\u2019m dealing with boys. I never get it sticky enough! Maybe I should get a rice cooker. There\u2019s a vinegar component too, right? I\u2019ve never added rice vinegar.How did you teach yourself to roll sushi\u2014YouTube videos?We like to sit at the sushi bar at BONDST and watch the guys there. They make it look a lot easier than it is! We\u2019ve never had official lessons, but we looked it up when someone gave us the sushi-rolling mat as a gift. I think everything comes down to that rice consistency, and that thing you said about wetting your hands.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.You post photos of fishing on Instagram a lot. What do you like to make with fresh catch?When the fluke are running Montauk, we have a fluke fish fry. Everyone\u2014even Kai who doesn\u2019t even eat fish\u2014will eat that. We catch a whole mess of them, double dip them, deep-fry and serve with corn and sriracha mayonnaise. That\u2019s just crazy delicious. Not super healthy, but delicious.If you were trapped on an island like in Isle of Dogs, do you think you could survive by fishing alone?As long as I had Sasha and Kai with me. They are my secret weapons. And they are amazing scavengers. Sasha dreams of being stuck on a desert island, and having to fend for himself. Between between mussels and the fish, I think we would do very well.What would be the five ingredients in your desert island toolkit?Olive oil, garlic, chile flakes, lemon, and salt. And I\u2019d need my best knife.Do you have a favorite knife?You've gotta have a good knife. It makes cooking so much easier and so much more fun. My brother got me a really beautiful Japanese sushi knife for my birthday six years ago. It\u2019s probably not fancy by your standards, but by my standards, it\u2019s the best knife in the world. It's one of those knives that I can\u2019t even take out when the kids are around. If I\u2019m doing fish, I use this one to clean them. I can\u2019t read the name because it\u2019s in Japanese, but it\u2019s the sharpest knife I\u2019ve ever owned.Is that the most prized possession in your kitchen?No, that would be my cocotte, my little Dutch oven. Actually, that\u2019s number two. The knife is the best. It can slice through anything. I like to make pho sometimes. And if you freeze the beef, and then you want to slice it real thin, this will go right through it.If you could only eat one food for the rest of your life, what would it be?When I was a kid, it was bananas. And then when I was about 30, it became broccoli. Now that I\u2019m 50, I\u2019ve learned to compromise. I think some sort of banana broccoli casserole would probably do it. Superfoods. If you don\u2019t have a choice, if it\u2019s to stay alive, then it\u2019s broccoli. And if it\u2019s absolutely anything I want, it\u2019s probably a fresh, hot baguette. That\u2019s probably the one thing that I find most irresistible in life.I buy mine at Parisi Bakery on Elizabeth Street. I used to walk my dog past it, and I\u2019d smell them baking. The guy was nice to me, so he would give me a hot one. Once they\u2019ve been out of the oven for more than two or three hours, it completely changes the flavor profile and everything. But if you can hook up with one of those immediately after it\u2019s come out of the oven, it\u2019s mind boggling. If it\u2019s fresh out of the oven, it needs absolutely nothing. An hour or two out of the oven, you might want a little butter or a nice soft cheese. I think I\u2019ll go get one now.This bakery has one of our favorite baguettes:Explore Bon App\u00e9titCelebritiesInterviewsRead MoretechniquesA Simple Step for Wayyy More Flavorful RiceBy Amanda ShapiroCurried Chicken Drumstickssponsored5 Fish Sushi Lovers Need to KnowBy Princess CruisesRecipes you want to make.
