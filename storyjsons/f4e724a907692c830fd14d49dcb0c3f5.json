While the pie pictured has a layered top crust to create a floral effect, here we call for a simple rolled-out top crust with a few vents, which does the job nicely.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Whisk flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder in a large bowl. Add butter and toss to coat. Working quickly and using a pastry blender or 2 butter knives, cut butter into flour to create large shaggy pieces of dough (you want some pea-size pieces of butter and some that are large and chunky). Drizzle half of the vinegar mixture over; stir with a fork until dough starts to come together (it should look a little dry, but add remaining vinegar mixture by the tablespoonful if needed).Step 2Transfer dough to a surface; gather into a ball. Using the heel of your hand, smear dough across surface by a full arm\u2019s length to flatten. Using a bench scraper, gather back into a ball. Smear and regather 2 more times. Cut dough in half. Wrap each piece tightly in plastic; flatten into a disk. Chill until firm, at least 1 hour.Do ahead: Dough can be made 1 week ahead. Keep chilled or freeze up to 1 month. If frozen, thaw overnight in refrigerator before using.Filling and assemblyStep 3Toss apples, granulated sugar, brown sugar, butter, lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, salt, 2 Tbsp. flour, and 1 tsp. rose water in a large bowl until evenly coated. Cover and chill at least 4 hours or up to 12 hours.Step 4Drain apples in a sieve set over a small saucepan; transfer apples back to bowl. Bring liquid to a boil over medium heat and cook until thickened, about 4 minutes. Pour sauce over apples; toss to combine.Step 5Let dough sit at room temperature 5 minutes, then roll out 1 disk of dough on a lightly floured surface to a 12\" round. Transfer to a standard 9\"-diameter pie dish, then lift edges and allow dough to slump down into dish. Trim, leaving about a \u00bd\" overhang; chill while you roll out remaining dough disk to a 10\" round. Using cookie cutter, punch out 4\u20138 vents in second round. Spoon apple filling, including any juices, into pie dish. Place second dough round over filling. Trim, leaving a 1\" overhang. Press crusts together and fold over to seal. Crimp edges; decorate with cutout dough pieces as desired. Chill pie in freezer 20 minutes.Step 6Meanwhile, place a rack in lower third of oven and preheat to 400\u00b0.Step 7Place pie on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet; brush crust with 2 Tbsp. cream. Bake 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375\u00b0 and continue to bake until crust is deep golden brown and juices are thick and bubbling, 60\u201380 minutes longer. Transfer pie to a wire rack and let cool at least 3 hours.Step 8Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat powdered sugar, remaining 1 cup cream, and remaining \u00bd tsp. rose water in a small bowl until cream begins to thicken. Reduce speed to medium and beat until soft peaks form.Step 9Serve slices of pie with whipped cream.Do ahead: Pie can be baked 1 day ahead. Store loosely covered at room temperature.Recipes adapted with permission from \u2018Cheryl Day\u2019s Treasury of Southern Baking\u2019 by Cheryl Day (Artisan Books).

The rose water created a light sweetness, subtle and present. The crust recipe reminded me of being 8 and learning how to make pie crust with my grandma, knives and rubbing and no quick fixes. It was so supple and easy to work with. \n\nA couple tweaks: \nI didn\u2019t end up with much juice after 10 hours of sitting so I added juice of 1 lemon, tsp of rose water and few squirts of honey to the juices to cook down. It resulted in a very bright syrup and very concentrated flavor. I would definetely repeat.\n\nI did a half dairy/half plant based butter for the crust (Miyokis cultured cashew butter). Again, texture, flavor, visuals were all spot on.\n\nProbably blasphemy here, but I used half brown sugar swerve after half coconut sugar to reduce overall sugar intake and glycemic load.\n\nThe comments I got from the pie were all rave. Thank you for this recipe!! AnonymousPortland, OR11/27/2021See Julia Child, Jeanne. Vol. 1, p. 141.  \"Fraisagea'Frank/BallNew York, NY11/16/2021That\u2018s the most ridiculous way to make pie crust that I\u2018ve ever seen. All that smearing results in too much handling and a tough crust.  I might make it again using my own crust recipe.\nJeanneIdaho11/12/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titDessertPieapple pieAppleFruitRose WaterAlcohol & Other DrinksBakeRecipes you want to make.
