Don\u2019t Sweat: Frozen Are Great TooWe love a ripe, juicy peach bursting with flavor. But when the only fresh ones you can find are just so-so, frozen is the move.By Alex BeggsAugust 9, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailWhen associate food editor Rachel Gurjar Otuama was assigned a peach summer cocktail recipe, she had visions of perfect peak season stone fruit dancing in her head. She pictured a drink made with the kind of August peaches that are so ripe they seem like they\u2019ll bruise if you look at them the wrong way. And while that may have been the dream, the reality was that she had to develop the recipe in...May. In New York. Which meant there were no decent peaches in sight\u2014except in the freezer aisle.So she picked up a bag of frozen peaches at Wegmans and developed this simple sparkling ros\u00e9, amaro, and Aperol spritz with them. And you know what? They were actually pretty tasty! Sure, they don\u2019t dazzle quite like the platonic ideal of the season\u2019s finest fresh fruit, but frozen peaches are harvested and preserved at their peak, so they\u2019re packed with flavor. (Plus, there\u2019s no risk of smushed skin or bruising, which seems to always happen to the fresh ones whenever I buy them. I use the smushed ones in this shrub recipe though, which is now my go-to for all mushy or disappointing fruit).As an added bonus, the frozen peaches pull double duty in a spritz, bringing ripe peachy flavor while also serving as cute ice cubes. By the time you get to the end of the glass (too soon), the frozen peaches will have defrosted and soaked up the ros\u00e9, leaving you with a crisp bite of boozy fruit. A prize! Love those.This is all to say, if you can\u2019t get killer fresh peaches, frozen is the move. Wanna buy some frozen peaches online? I\u2019m a huge fan of Detroit-based Farm to Freezer\u2019s peaches, which you get a two-pound bag of in this $40 frozen fruit box assortment of all their summer fruits. They freeze local produce with a small blast chiller within a few hours of harvesting, Brandon Seng, the company\u2019s founder, told me. (Blast chilling means they\u2019re frozen with gusts of cold air rather than liquid nitrogen.) I love their frozen sour cherries for making lazy clafoutis, but the frozen peaches are great for baking too, despite our inclination to think of frozen fruit as smoothie-only material.When fruits are frozen, their cell wall ruptures, Seng explained, and they can lose some of their structure. So a defrosted blueberry won\u2019t be as bouncy as a fresh one, which is fine in smoothies. Farm to Freezer\u2019s frozen apples and peaches, though, have a sturdier flesh and hold up pretty well to freezing compared to delicate berries; his kids defrost the peaches and eat them out of hand.So the next time you\u2019re craving a cocktail or dessert made with peaches in November, or all the prospects at the August farmers market are mealy and wan, don\u2019t despair. Frozen peaches are here for you all year long.Just Peachy:Peach-Aperol SpritzFizzy peach sangria made with sparkling rose, ripe fruit, and a touch of aperol = the perfect summer party drink.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishFarmers Market ChallengeRecipes you want to make.
