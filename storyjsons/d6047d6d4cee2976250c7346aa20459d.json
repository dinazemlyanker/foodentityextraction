Duong was just a year old when she boarded the boat in the middle of the night, escaping the takeover of the communist regime. The family eventually landed in Long Beach, California.It may seem like escaping a war as a baby would be the most defining aspect of Duong\u2019s (or anyone\u2019s) identity. But her life has been equally shaped by what happened after: the arrival of her youngest brother, Sang Duong.Sang has Down syndrome. He was born in Long Beach, and Duong spent her childhood taking care of him alongside her parents, who opened their own clothing manufacturing business. At age 22 she moved to Dallas, initially working in the corporate world but ultimately becoming the owner of a Vietnamese sandwich shop, Sandwich Hag.Sang is the reason she opened Sandwich Hag in Dallas, a restaurant that, in a city often ignored for its food offerings, is serving a dazzling take on Vietnamese home cooking. Thirty to forty percent of her part-time employee force, at the restaurant and for events, encompasses individuals with different abilities, including those with Down syndrome.Duong initially hated cooking but had vivid childhood food memories of her mom making spaghetti seasoned with fish sauce, and b\u00e1nh t\u00e9t, sticky rice wrapped in banana leaves and filled with mung beans or plantains. \u201cShe would hold yarn with her teeth and stretch and wrap the banana leaves,\u201d she recalls. \u201cEach one hung like a pair of\u2026\u201d she pauses. \u201cWhat\u2019s that? Bruce Lee?\u201d she pauses. \u201cOh! Nunchucks. I mean, the talent of this woman.\u201dBut the food memories are intertwined with difficult ones. Her parents did not understand how to handle a child with Down syndrome (on top of 11 others), and her father had a gambling addiction. He was physically abusive to Sang, she says, her tone slowing and her bubbly energy coming to a halt.Life in Long Beach was chaotic and crowded. Duong\u2019s parents were busy running their business, and they enlisted the help of their kids to stitch shoulder pads and steam garments. \u201cI wanted to go outside and play all the time,\u201d she adds, \u201cbut I was expected to be more responsible.\u201d She didn\u2019t even realize until later in life that someone close to her had sexually abused her as a kid\u2014she brushed any feelings of discomfort under the rug. She was more concerned for her brother Sang.\u201cThere were moments where I could tell they were embarrassed of my brother,\u201d Duong says. \u201cThat was tough for my dad because in our community, it is a lot of saving face,\u201d or wanting to create a veneer of stability in front of others.When her parents were in their 80s, Duong assumed custody of Sang, after her father told her that Sang would become the state\u2019s responsibility after he died. For the first time, Sang shared with her the extent of the physical abuse he had endured at his father\u2019s hands.Duong\u2019s parents both passed within the next two years. When Sang came to live with her in Dallas, the two were still in mourning. To honor their mother\u2019s memory, Duong cooked Vietnamese food. She made bun thit xao, thinly sliced pork with noodles, and fish sauce spaghetti. \u201cWhen I would make my curry, every time, he\u2019d go, \u2018Oh, Mom made that.\u2019 \u201dCooking for Sang, she realized that working in food was far more exciting to her than the corporate life. So she and her partner, Arthur Andrade, rented a tiny old cigar lounge in the Cedars district surrounded by yards of asphalt. Neither of them had any restaurant experience.The homemade pork sausage banh mi.\nPhoto by Alex LauShe put together a short menu of everything-from-scratch Vietnamese staples: banh mi stuffed with a homemade pork sausage patty that sing with honey and fish sauce; a silky turmeric and coconut milk stew slow-cooked with onions, carrots, bell peppers, and chicken thighs; and tightly wrapped spring rolls stuffed with carrots, radishes, and herbs.\u201cI was advised to remove my \u2018no modifications\u2019 policy and told that Dallas may not be ready for fish sauce,\u201d she says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Fuck off.\u2019\u201dShe named the place \u201cSandwich Hag\u201d\u2014the first word a reference to the menu\u2019s signature banh mi, and \u201chag\u201d to take back the pejorative word often used to describe women.  She decorated the patio with string lights, botanical artwork, and graffiti-coated chairs. The restaurant became a walk-up window attached to a small kitchen.Most important: She decided to bring on Sang to help maintain the patio and expedite orders, and to hire others like him.\u201cI was going to build a restaurant and create a culture where Sang was right by my side,\u201d she says. \u201cI told him, \u2018This is a restaurant; you\u2019ve got to learn and act right and be appropriate.\u2019 I held him accountable just like everyone else.\u201dOn a recent afternoon in Sandwich Hag\u2019s tiny kitchen, Duong\u2019s jet-black hair was pulled back tightly with a hair clip, showing off her chili sauce earrings and black thickly rimmed glasses. She toasted crackly baguettes from a Vietnamese bakery in nearby Garland, TX in the old Quiznos toaster she and Andrade found at an auction, and mixed up the pungent garlic aioli for the banh mi.Creating an environment where Sang and other differently abled people could succeed required making a few changes. For example, because Sang can\u2019t read well, she uses a color-coding system to help him identify customers\u2019 drink orders (coconut coffee is pink, for instance). She simplifies the vocabulary she uses in the kitchen\u2014when a delivery order is ready, she says, \u201cThe order is ready. Hit the green button,\u201d and Sang now knows to respond with \u201cMark as ready?\u201d \u201cI pay attention to the language that works and tweak our process,\u201d she says. Sang sometimes has trouble with numbers, so instead of telling him the number of baguettes to place in the toaster, she will say \u201cOne,\u201d and Sang will respond with \u201cOne\u201d and put the baguettes in one at a time until Duong tells him to stop.But she says Sang\u2019s energetic personality is a perfect fit for the restaurant business. \u201cWhat some of my family members saw as a burden, I saw in Sang as a positive,\u201d she says. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t like something, he will tell you. He always says, \u2018Yes, chef.\u2019 He will always remind new hires to put on gloves and wash hands. He is dedicated, and he is passionate. I\u2019ll be trying to close the restaurant and he wants to mop.\u201dSang\u2019s uniform consists of black glasses similar to his sister\u2019s and a red bandana wrapped around his head. In person he\u2019s super cheerful, a go-getter. \u201cI love peeling ginger, mopping, sweeping, talking to people,\u201d he says.To Duong, food is only one part of Sandwich Hag\u2019s mission. She uses the restaurant to advocate for individuals like Sang. She works with an organization called LaunchAbility, a career-services center for people with different abilities, to recruit employees. Each year she hosts a party at the restaurant for World Down Syndrome Day, where she invites neighboring vendors and a local brewery to raise awareness for the cause. She helps cater the Community Ball, an annual event for the nonprofit My Possibilities, an educational program that Sang is currently enrolled in. But she thinks the most important thing she can do is to put Sang at the front and center of the restaurant, to normalize his presence.\u201cWe want to create hope for young children with Down syndrome, to see that Sang is working here,\u201d she says. \u201cHe is all over our social media. He is talking to customers.\u201dThere are challenges to having Sang and others with disabilities work at the restaurant, Duong says. She has to be very patient, and customers sometimes get annoyed that orders may take longer to come out.Neither the state of Texas nor the federal government are particularly friendly toward people of all disabilities either. Mountains of paperwork and bureaucracy make it extremely difficult for even the most informed individuals to navigate career paths for disabled family members, Duong tells me. Most of all, disabled persons aren\u2019t allowed to earn their food handler\u2019s certificate, meaning Sang can\u2019t make the curry or slice the cucumbers for the banh mi. It\u2019s a law that befuddles Duong. \"Sang is so clean, he always uses gloves,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for the city of Dallas to get its act together.\u201dShe believes change can start with the restaurant industry, a business where there is a severe labor shortage right now. \u201cSeeing how able and smart and intuitive and passionate Sang is, I feel that it is an oversight for companies not to recognize that,\u201d she says. \u201cI am hoping to break the barrier of discomfort.\u201dShe knows that she is fighting an uphill battle taking on these issues as a restaurant operator in a conservative state like Texas. But the glowing reviews and wraparound lines are the surest indication that what she\u2019s doing is working.\u201cIf you eat my food, my food will speak for itself,\u201d she says. \u201cBut Sang can\u2019t speak for himself, and I can\u2019t keep quiet. I don\u2019t know any other way to be the example except to just do it, you know?\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurants + TravelDallasChefsRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
