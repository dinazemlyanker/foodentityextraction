You know them, you love them. But what is a potato, really? And where did potatoes come from?\u00a0Potatoes, quite simply, are the tuber that changed the world. Originally domesticated by Indigenous peoples of the Andean highlands and brought back across the Atlantic by Spanish colonizers in the 16th century, many researchers argue that the humble potato contributed to the rise of modern forms of agriculture in Europe. Today it\u2019s the world\u2019s fifth-largest staple crop. For our part potatoes are far and away America\u2019s most consumed produce item\u2014we eat nearly 50 pounds per person each year. (Unsurprisingly, tomatoes take the number-two spot; what\u2019re french fries without ketchup?)So what is a potato exactly?Known as Solanum tuberosum, potatoes are a tuber (not the same as a root vegetable like, say, a radish) that fall into the \u201cstarchy vegetable\u201d category. (So yes, potatoes absolutely count as a vegetable according to the USDA.) Typically grown in cooler climates and seasons, they come in a vast variety of sizes, colors, shapes, and textures.Potatoes aplenty!\nPhotograph by Isa ZapataWhat potatoes should I buy?The wide world of spuds is staggeringly diverse\u2014Peru\u2019s International Potato Center has preserved close to 5,000 unique varieties. But, broadly speaking, your local grocery store is likely to have a few main types on offer, each suited to different preparations:FlouryThe russet, a floury friend.\nPhotograph by Isa ZapataRelatively low in moisture and high in starch, with dark, matte skins, floury types like russets and Idahos cook up light, fluffy, and a little crumbly, which makes them ideal for a classic baked potato or a smooth, creamy mash. Their starchiness means that these potatoes also lend themselves well to fried applications, like crispy-on-the-outside, creamy-on-the-inside french fries and potato pancakes.WaxyIn contrast to their floury counterparts, waxy potatoes tend to have thinner, shinier skins and dense flesh that\u2019s moister and lower in starch. Red Bliss, new potatoes, fingerlings, and a lot of the smaller, cuter varieties fit into this category. These hold their shape well when cooked and are therefore perfect for applications where that\u2019s a priority\u2014think potato salad, gratin, roasted potatoes, and good old-fashioned boiled-and-buttered spuds.Waxy\u2014but like, in a good way!\nPhotograph by Isa ZapataAll-PurposeTwo words: Yukon Gold. This storied variety and other floury-waxy hybrids have been bred to be somewhere in the middle. The Goldilocks of potatoes, they\u2019re not too crumbly, not too dense, and versatile enough to work in almost all preparations. Boil them. Mash them. Roast them. Stir-fry them. You name it, these potatoes can do it.\u2026but wait, there\u2019s more!Having ready access to supermarket potatoes you know will perform as expected is a beautiful thing. But if you love potatoes as much as we do, you\u2019d be missing out if you didn\u2019t play the field. (Remember: 5,000 varieties.) The fall farmers market can be a great place to try out delicious and idiosyncratic heirloom varieties you\u2019re less likely to find in stores, like purple-fleshed Magic Mollys, creamy Russian Bananas, and adorable pink Red Thumbs. And if you\u2019re not sure how to prepare them, just ask whoever\u2019s selling them for their favorite method.Does buying organic potatoes matter?According\u00a0to the Environmental Working Group, potatoes retain fairly\u00a0high levels of pesticides relative to other kinds of produce (they grow in the dirt, so it kind of makes sense), so it's best to shell out the extra buck for organic if you can.Potato, potahto, gimme that recipe:Perfect Baked PotatoCrisp on the outside, pillowy on the inside, and up for dancing with any savory flavor in your fridge or pantry.\u00a0View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingPotatoRecipes you want to make.
