Here at Mon Lapin, they transform local produce into simple but sophisticated small plates.ORDER: whatever appeals to you from the daily-changing menu. The tiny open kitchen behind the four-seat bar puts out beautiful vegetable-centric small plates, fresh pastas, a few larger proteins, and particularly refined desserts served on vintage plates. Mon Lapin offers a small selection of wines by the glass, listed on the wall mirror, but sommelier Vanya Filipovic puts together an extensive bottle list celebrating small winemakers who use minimal intervention as an approach.THE VIBE IS: relaxed. The small light-filled space has only about ten tables, but the leather benches, white walls, and occasional piece of rabbit paraphernalia tucked into a corner give it an open feel. You\u2019ll find hip, tattooed Montrealers sipping unfiltered orange wine with Fleetwood Mac playing in the background.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Tuesday to Saturday 5 p.m. to midnight. Closed Sunday and Monday. Tables are first come, first served, so go early (as in before 6 p.m.) on Saturdays.\u2014Claire SaffitzTwo Food PhotographersTwo Food PhotographersWE ALSO LOVEJoe BeefAn over-the-top meal unlike any other, in Little BurgundyLe Vin PapillonLittle Burgundy\u2019s natural wine hubFoxyA perennially packed wood-fired hangout in GriffintownExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
