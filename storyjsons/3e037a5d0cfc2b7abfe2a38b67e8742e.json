I\u2019d stand on a milk crate in front of the soft-serve machine, filling up cones and making sure each one had that perfect peak. Later on, I became a pastry chef, whipping up 15-gallon batches of ice cream at a time and churning upwards of eight flavors a night before each service. What I\u2019m trying to say is: I know and love ice cream, so you should believe me when I tell you that Jeni\u2019s Splendid Ice Creams is the best.It doesn\u2019t matter what your favorite ice cream flavor is, Jeni\u2019s has you covered. If mint chip is your thing\u2014lookin\u2019 at you, Chris Morocco\u2014Jeni\u2019s mint chip is worth throwing your spoon across the kitchen for. I foolishly thought vanilla was my favorite flavor. Then I tried  Jeni\u2019s honey vanilla bean and realized that is actually my favorite flavor.Jeni\u2019s is a premium Philadelphia-style ice cream, which means it doesn\u2019t contain any eggs or yolks; all the richness and body comes from high-quality, grass-fed milk and cream. Without eggs getting in the way, the flavors of the dairy, honey, and vanilla really shine through. It\u2019s creamy and decadent but still finishes so clean and light on the palate that I can easily eat a whole pint in one sitting. And because it\u2019s lighter than French-style, custard-based ice creams, this vanilla ice cream is made for \u00e0 la mode. There\u2019s nothing better to top a warm slice of blueberry pie with, or sandwich between a couple of BA\u2019s best chocolate chip cookies.The Jeni behind Jeni\u2019s was also a pastry chef, and it shows in the way she balances the delicate floral flavors of honey and vanilla with just the right amount of salt. Don\u2019t worry: This isn\u2019t a salty ice cream by any means, but it\u2019s seasoned just enough to enhance the musky, sweet aroma of vanilla. This vanilla bean-speckled pint hits me hard in a way other vanillas never have. It wakes up my old ice cream shop memories and makes it almost impossible for me to stop eating once I pop open a pint. I\u2019m not kidding: This past Valentine\u2019s Day, in lieu of flowers, my husband surprised me with a six-pack of Jeni\u2019s ice cream. I think you know which pint I spooned my way through first.Buy it: Honey Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, $12 for a pint at Jeni\u2019sAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
