Here, quick-cooking fillets of fish are slathered in a deeply flavorful combination of miso, butter, and panko, then broiled until the breadcrumbs form a toasty, golden crust. My days as a line cook at Perry St restaurant in New York inspired the technique behind this dish. It was my first job out of culinary school, and in the winter we\u2019d make a similar dish using roast cod topped with a thin sheet of truffle butter reinforced with panko. This is an easier, far more accessible version that\u2019s just as tasty. I use my preferred technique of cooking fish with the skin on (it holds the flesh together as it cooks) yet with no intention of getting it crispy\u2014I just lift the fish away from the skin when it\u2019s time to serve. I find that chasing crispy fish skin is a heartbreaking pursuit, so I don\u2019t even bother. Besides, you won\u2019t miss it with all the texture from the buttery panko business on top. \u2014Shilpa Uskokovic\u00a0All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Place, skin side down, on empty half of baking sheet.Step 3Now, make the miso butter: Place 3 Tbsp. unsalted butter in a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on medium power in 20-second intervals until melted. (Alternatively, melt butter in a small skillet over medium.) Add 6 Tbsp. white or yellow miso, 1 Tbsp. plus 1\u00bd tsp.

Roast fish and asparagus until fillets are firm when sides are gently pressed, 15\u201317 minutes.\u00a0Step 6Heat broiler (to low, if your oven allows).

After reading the reviews, I only salted the asparagus lightly, spread a thin layer of the miso butter on the fish, and tossed the asparagus with less butter than pictured. The end result was delicious and different from anything I usually make. I didn\u2019t find the flavour overpowering at all, I think in part because I used light miso, which is milder. I cooked the salmon for a bare 15 minutes and only had to broil for a minute and a half to brown the panko. Salmon was lovely; I think it helped that I got it to room temperature before cooking.JaneApp2/17/2022Include  printable recipe, please!!!!AnonymousAlexandria, VA1/31/2022Waaaaaay too much paste, and much, much too salty. I mean, don't get me wrong, I *love* salt but I could literally feel my blood pressure elevate. Also, even if the salt was dialed down, the flavor was just too damn much. Definitely DO NOT mix the paste with the asparagus. Or, better yet, just make another recipe. \nMy leftovers will be going straight into the trash.AnonymousWashington, D.C.1/18/2022I\u2019ve made this several times an think it\u2019s a keeper.  I agree that if the fish fillet is thin, you need to reduce the paste and also maybe leave the veggies plain as the paste is so intense.  I\u2019ve cooked this with striped bass, black bass and Chilean sea bass and they have all be delicious.JodiNYC12/20/2021One of the most delicious fish recipes I\u2019ve ever made. Read other reviews, played around with recipe and here\u2019s my two cents\u2026I prefer the (non refrigerated) shelf version shiro miso paste. It\u2019s Mild & Sweet with better texture. Used 1tsp of Gochu Jang paste instead of Sriracha and omitted ginger entirely. Personal preference. Next, cover filets with miso butter depending on their thickness. If you have thinner filets only spread a thin layer, otherwise it overpowered it for us. Just eating mouthfuls of paste. Thicker, obviously use a little more. Pile on the panko. That\u2019s the secret weapon. Read another review about baking\u2026I kick the oven up to 425 and find I don\u2019t even need to broil. Keep them in til darker golden brown crust forms and fish \u201cjust\u201d starts to separate. It\u2019s weird cuz you literally have to eye it. Lastly, didn\u2019t spread it on asparagus. It just overpowered it and we try to be fairly mindful of our salt intake. This recipe is a total winner and so easy! A. IngallsLos Angeles 10/23/2021It was quick, easy, and very delicious! However, it was very salty and I found that the asparagus really didn't need the miso topping. The balance of this dish needs some adjustments but it is a definite do again!ThomasRochester, NY10/18/2021Delicious, quick, and simple! Perfect weeknight meal. The miso butter is SO good. I did not find this to be too salty, at all. LauraPhiladelphia, PA10/15/2021Fantastic weekday dinner that's super easy to make. I made it with salmon filets & served with a microwave packet of brown rice & quinoa. Next time b/c of my oven, I'll bake/roast for 12min & switch to broil for 2min to get it nice & browned,yet a tad underdone.SoCalJLRSan Diego, CA 10/12/2021i really wanted to love this dish but i found it incredibly salty. i followed the recipe exactly except for using less sriracha. i don\u2019t know if it was the miso i used. i wish i had loved it as other reviewers did. i might try it  again with a 1/3 of the amount of miso and see if that makes a difference. jenLos Angeles 9/23/2021Overall this dish was awesome but I'll use less miso less time.  I used green beans because it's what I had.  I'll definitely make this again!  EvanTulsa, OK9/1/2021Love this recipe. The spice with the crunch and the flakey white fish\u2026 I used Sole, so quick cooking\u2026 easy and healthy. My fish was large so I modified the sriracha/ miso as well as the cooking time. Asparagus yummy but I also tried lightly broiled zucchini served with wild rice. Awesome compliment K gallucci Houston Texas 7/8/2021Next time, I\u2019ll use half as much of the miso butter on the fish. It\u2019s super flavorful, but it was slightly over powering. Loved the crunch of the panko, wouldn\u2019t change that.  We used striped bass, and it was great. As the fish rested, I roasted the asparagus separately like I usually do, on a sheet pan with a little oil, under high broiler for about 3-4 min. Finishing asparagus with a tad of miso butter was yummy. LaraChicago, IL6/30/2021This was INSANE. Quite possibly the best fish recipe I've ever made. And also the easiest. Followed the recipe exactly, minus one minute from initial cook time. Thanks BA!DanielleSan Francisco, CA6/24/2021Made this recipe exactly as written using 4 8 oz filets of salmon. I  was worried the salmon would overcook after cooking for that long, but it turned out incredible, and would definitely make it again!JacobPhiladelphia, PA6/24/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titArctic CharFishSeafoodBassSalmonMisoCondiments, Sauces & PastesAsparagusVegetableEasyMainNut-FreeRoastDinnerBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
