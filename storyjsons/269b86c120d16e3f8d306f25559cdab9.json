A few graham crackers crumbled into the pastry dough give this homey blueberry and peach galette a sweet and nutty flavor that compliments the fruit.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Please advice. Thank you.\nAnonymousChicago, Ol11/17/2021OK, I've baked my share of pastry over the years and never had a problem with the dough like I did with this one. It was a disaster. The dough stuck to the parchment paper and I could not \"slide\" it off. I ended up tossing the dough and turning the fruit into an oat topped crisp - didn't want to waste the filling!. I might try it again, but with a couple of changes - more flour on the parchment and assembling on the baking sheet instead of trying to slide it off the paper. If you use a large pizza pan it will have enough room around the edges to assemble.Donna LavalleeMundelein, IL9/17/2021This was DELICIOUS!  Everyone I served it to had seconds.  Peach and blueberry is a great combination and the graham flavor in the crust is a nice touchJackie MMadison, WI9/11/2021Fantastic and easy recipe! Made this with my daughter this afternoon, with gorgeous fresh Ontario peaches and wild blueberries from Quebec. Use gf flour and graham crackers. Turned out beautifully. We\u2019ll be using the crust recipe to adapt for other fruit galettes all fall. Yum!AnonymousCanada8/23/2021On my first roll out the crust cracked at the edges so I added 2 tbs of ice water, reformed the disk and refrigerated the disk for 15 minutes.  Extra water solved the problem and the second roll out was perfect.  Great recipe.AnonymousPhoenix8/22/2021I have made this twice now, both times I used a refrigerated crust. The first time there was a lot of juice that seeped out. The second time I increased the cornstarch to 2 tablespoons and did not slice the peaches until the crust was ready. Minor seepage this time. Lovely to look at--delicious to eat.JoPendleton, OR8/15/2021Even my mother, who's a baker extraordinaire, said I beat her pie crust.  Well, probably equal.  For a novice, I made the dough once and over did it with ice water.  Tried again.  3 Tbsp OR just scant.  Perfection.   No leftovers, just rave reviews.   Amy OutlawHouston, TX8/9/2021Delicious with the addtion of graham cracker to the crust. I never thought about galettes having a better crust to fruit ratio!! I am a crust lover!!! I did drain the fruit before adding to the crust. So good!!!Mardy MRolling Hills Estates, CA8/7/2021Made this delicious dessert while camping. Added plums and used 1 large peach. I baked it in a cast iron pan. It was enjoyed by all and there was no leftovers. I\u2019m baking another one today. AnonymousChico 8/7/2021I am a self-professed learner in pastry, so it's possible I screwed something up, but I found the crust way too crumbly. No amount of extra ice water/flour helped. I'd be willing to try again, but might try doing it by hand next time to make sure everything is properly hydrated.RitaChicago8/5/2021We loved it!  The crust was perfect, no problems working with it.  Delicious and delicate pastry.  I had one bad peach, so I also used a nectarine and some pitted sweet local cherries with the blueberries.  Farm to table.  Did not use cinnamon with the fruit.  Did use cinnamon graham crackers.  We will be enjoying this again  AnonymousCedarburg, wi8/1/2021I\u2019ve tried twice to make this without much success. The first time , the dough was super sticky and impossible to fold over fruit. I baked it anyway and served as a( very tasty) crumble. I tried a second time & used American butter but this time the dough kept cracking while rolling ,again making it impossible to fold over. When it calls for 4 graham crackers , is it 4 sheets of graham crackers or 4 perforated rectangles? I converted the 2 ounces in the recipe to my cracker box measurements which was 4 sheets of crackers. Is that my problem? Needs clarification . AnonymousPhiladelphia8/1/2021This is an excellent recipe. My berries were a little tart so I added extra sugar. Peaches were super juicy so I did get some leakage. Crust was perfect even with the leakage. Everyone thought it was delicious. Definitely will continue to make this. Marie Fernandina Beach FL7/27/2021I\u2019ve been searching for years for the best way to celebrate peaches and blueberries in the same dessert, and this is it.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The fruit gave off a LOT of liquid in the bowl which I did not try to put into the galette.  Then so much liquid leaked out during baking that I was afraid of a soggy bottom, but no.  The crust was both crispy and flaky.  Perfection!MichelleMetro Boston7/25/2021My fruit was ripe, so my filling didn\u2019t need any additional sugar like the other reviewer suggested. I had bought some peaches and blackberries at the farmers market, so I swapped out the blueberries for blackberries and it turned out great. The flavor of the crust was good, but it was more brittle and less flaky than the crust I normally make. I usually make my dough my hand, but used the food processor this time, so perhaps that\u2019s why it wasn\u2019t as flaky. Either way, I\u2019ll definitely make this one again \u2014 it was very easy!KeenaPortland, Oregon7/23/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titGaletteDessertFruit DessertPeachStone FruitFruitBlueberryBerryGraham CrackerOther IngredientsSummerNut-FreeBakingRecipes you want to make.
