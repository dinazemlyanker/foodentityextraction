Read all the stories here.It\u2019s been too long since we\u2019ve thrown dinner parties. And now that we\u2019re beginning to get together with vaxxed and boosted company, we want to do things a little differently. As it turns out, the time off from hosting has given us a new perspective. Like: Life is too short to spend all that time in the kitchen! And our guests actually do want to help, so let them. And so much more.\u00a0So these are our new rules: the things we\u2019re trying out, ditching, and embracing for the first time. We hope they help you feel empowered, inspired, or at least a little more relaxed. Because dinner parties are supposed to be parties, not pressure. And in the end, that\u2019s the only rule that counts.\u00a0Skip the main. If you\u2019re worried or want to ease into the idea of hosting after the past year plus, a dessert party (or snack party) may be a more doable endeavor. It\u2019s easier on you too, requiring much less prep and cleanup. \u2014Zaynab Issa, associate food editorStop hiding in the kitchen. I used to serve coursed dinners to friends, doing mains like risotto that basically require you to be in the kitchen at exactly the same time that your friends are loosening up with wine and cheese and things are getting interesting. Unless you\u2019re serving pasta, you shouldn\u2019t really be cooking anything after your guests arrive. \u2014Chris Morocco, test kitchen directorApply the \u201cclean as you go\u201d rule. Get everyone to do one round of cleanup in between dinner and dessert or before your guests leave. Trust me, they won\u2019t mind, and you won\u2019t be left with the dreaded leaning tower of dirties. Assign away so each person is only doing a little bit! \u2014Rachel Gurjar, associate food editorEmbrace clutter. Clean your apartment and maybe light a candle or two. But it\u2019s okay to leave out the pet toys, the coffee mugs, the mail, all the detritus that any apartment accumulates. Your friends can know that you actually live here. \u2014Karen Yuan, lifestyle editorDitch the place settings\u2014or the table entirely. I used to spend so much time folding napkins and filling water glasses, but my guests inevitably left both untouched. Not sure what that says about my friends...but I\u2019m over it. When I moved, I sacrificed a dining room table for a sectional couch and never looked back. \u2014Amanda Shapiro, digital editorial directorSet up a DIY bar. Let guests assemble their own tacos, build their own chaat, or make their own hand rolls with prepared fillings. It saves you from fretting over serving people, accommodates a variety of dietary restrictions, lets everyone mingle and eat at their own pace, and makes the event so much more memorable. \u2014Antara Sinha, associate cooking editorJust plan ahead. From my experiences of both hosting dinner parties and throwing pop-up events, that\u2019s my one tip. Make a list for the ingredients, equipment, and tabletop needs. Plan out how you\u2019re going to use your oven, stovetop, and fridge spaces. \u2014Jessie YuChen, associate food editorThrow a \u201ccome as you were\u201d party. The hostess Elsa Maxwell once threw one where everyone had to show up dressed in whatever they were wearing when they got the invite. Text/email your invitations at all hours of the night and see what your friends show up in. Alternate theme: \u201cCome as your enemy.\u201d \u2014Alexandra Beggs, senior staff writerGet even more dinner party rules:ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Explore Bon App\u00e9titPartiesDinner PartiesCultureLifestyleRecipes you want to make.
