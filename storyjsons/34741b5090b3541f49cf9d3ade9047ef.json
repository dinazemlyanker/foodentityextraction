Like, really matters. Staying in Venice? Good luck getting to Silver Lake. Shacking up in the Arts District? You won\u2019t see Malibu. So when I go to L.A., I stay in Los Feliz, and I do it because of the focaccia. Specifically the focaccia with burrata and cherry tomatoes at All Time, the Los Feliz breakfast destination that turns into a ridiculously romantic dinner spot at night. The focaccia is always at the top of the menu so you have no excuse not to order it. The bread, made by L.A. bread institution Bub and Grandma\u2019s, bends under the weight of the burrata while the generous pour of olive oil will drip onto your fingers and the halved cherry tomatoes will fall off the sides. You won\u2019t care because you\u2019re in focaccia heaven. With a crisp glass of p\u00e9t-nat, it\u2019s the perfect meal for one.Go there: All TimeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsLos AngelesRecipes you want to make.
