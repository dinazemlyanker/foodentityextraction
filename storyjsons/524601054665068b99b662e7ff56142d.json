See our past recommendations here!I'm not a lotion person, and not just because Silence of the Lambs ruined the word for me forever. Most lotions smell weird, even if they claim to be unscented, and I just don't have the energy to add more steps to my personal-care routine.But despite my strong stance against lotion, I'm not immune to the ravages of winter. And my hands are suffering especially badly now that I'm washing them all. the. time. So I've been keeping a tube of Make Beauty's Marine Salve in my bag instead. It's oil-based and thicker than lotion, so just a dab is enough to coat my parched hands in a protective layer for the rest of the day. (The \"marine\" part of the name refers to an extract of edible marine algae called wakame, a.k.a. Undaria pinnatifida, that supposedly protects against pollution, heavy metals, and free radicals. Great if true...what\u2019s a free radical, again?) I also use it on my chapped lips and the corners of my nose when I've been blowing it a lot. And I rub the salve into my palms and then over my hair to smooth flyaways.A tube will run you $20, but mine has gotten me through two winters so far. It comes in three tinted shades, but I'm wedded to the classic for now. Also, and this I can swear by, it really is unscented.Buy it: MAKE Marine Hand Salve, $20All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
