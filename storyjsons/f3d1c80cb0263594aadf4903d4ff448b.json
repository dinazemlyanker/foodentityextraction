I was on the up and up! Then I actually started using it. Turns out it was an arm workout just bringing that thing out, and I found myself reaching for it less and less.Just when I lost hope in finding the right cutting board for me, I stumbled upon the Five Two Bamboo Cutting Board. It\u2019s the perfect size\u2014large enough for cutting big pieces of meat or chopping two things at once, fitting diced onions on one side and minced garlic on the other. But it\u2019s not so huge that it\u2019s a pain to handle. The board is relatively lightweight\u2014only five pounds\u2014and therefore easy to move around and clean. Plus, the edges are slightly tapered, so you can get a good grip underneath to pick it up, a thing I never knew my boards were missing until now.But that's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this cutting board\u2019s versatility. One side is entirely flat and smooth for all your chopping needs, save for a carved-out slot on the far right corner meant to prop up your iPhone. I honestly never thought I would use it, but now I can\u2019t imagine cooking without it. When I\u2019m watching The Good Fight on my laptop\u2014my show of choice at the moment\u2014I can slip my phone into the slot and pull the recipe without missing a beat. I can FaceTime my mom as I prep my ingredients, without forcing her to look at the kitchen ceiling instead of my adorable face (I unfortunately still have to watch her ceiling).The other side of the cutting board has a deep moat around its entire perimeter to catch any juices if you\u2019re, say, carving a chicken, cutting watermelon, or slicing rounds of citrus. There\u2019s even a little spout at one corner to pour said juices off.It\u2019s also pretty, which means I\u2019ve used it to serve appetizers and have even set it out with sliced-up steak in the middle of the dinner table. I still love my Boos for holding bottles of oil and vinegar on the counter or scenarios where I can wipe down a mess easily like slicing bread. But these days, I find myself pulling out my Five Two board day in and day out.Five Two Bamboo Cutting Board$59 $41 at NordstromExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingRead MorecultureIf Your Oven Is the WORST, Consider This Precise Multifunctional Countertop MiracleBy Yossy ArefiRecipes you want to make.
