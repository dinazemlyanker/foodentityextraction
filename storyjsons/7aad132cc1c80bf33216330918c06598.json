I\u2019d spend hours crafting my buddy profile in neon-pink Impact typeface that would have all of my BFF\u2019s names underneath. I\u2019d write HAGS in the yearbook of that kid I had that one class with that one time. I\u2019d write LYLAS in the countless cards of Hebrew school friends whose bat mitzvahs I\u2019d attend. And a few years later, I get to use this acquired skill as the associate social media manager of Bon App\u00e9tit. Even my mom cannot escape it.My mom has no time for that nonsense.\nSo when I heard Molly Baz talking about this thing called TOTES toast, I was excited AF to make it. TOTES stands for tuna, olives, tomato, eggs, shallot. It\u2019s a ni\u00e7oise salad, hold the lettuce, perched atop a piece of crusty sourdough bread, living its truth.If this were 2010, we would be in the version of Facebook that let you have a teeny-tiny bio underneath your profile picture, and mine probably would\u2019ve said something like <3 ToAsT LoVr <3 because I love toast THAT much. I\u2019ve written about it on BonAppetit.com, posted it on my Instagram, and gotten several looks from coworkers when the smell of burning breadcrumbs wafts through the office at 10:30 a.m.I prefer to eat TOTES toast at home because it\u2019s piled high with fun things. It\u2019s messy. But first, we\u2019re frying up some bread because it needs to be sturdy enough to support all of the things that are about to go on top of it.Yes, this story comes with memes.\nThen we need to mix up the paprika-spiked mayo that consists of mayo (Hellmann\u2019s or Duke\u2019s only, plz), paprika, grated garlic, and red wine vinegar. The red wine vinegar cuts the fat in the mayo, and the spice in the paprika wakes up your senses enough to remind you of the privilege that is eating TOTES toast. Next, toss thinly sliced shallots and tomatoes in some lemon juice; I use cherry tomatoes here because it isn\u2019t peak tomato season in NYC.Other toppings: cured black olives from the antipasto bar at Whole Foods, olive oil\u2013packed tuna (the good stuff), and 8-minute eggs. At this point, I took a photo of my mise en place for my Instagram story.Order of assembly: mayo, tuna, olives, tomato-shallot mixture with some of the juices, sliced eggs, flaky salt, and pepper.Finish it with your favorite torn herbs and a glug of EVOO. Turn on your favorite show (Jersey Shore season 3) and tell your friends you\u2019ll TTYL.And if you\u2019re thinking that all of these acronyms are getting to be too much, let me share this inspiring message exchange between Bon App\u00e9tit editor in chief Adam Rapoport and me after discussing a very pressing Instagram matter:Our editor in chief is quite insightful.\nLike an acronym, life is short! Save the time you spent by skipping all of those full-length words and make some toast.Here\u2019s the recipe:Ni\u00e7oise ToastFried bread, with buttery oil-packed tuna on top. This is what you call dinner toast.View RecipeRelated: The Canned Tuna I Bring to the Beach (Yes, the Beach!)Explore Bon App\u00e9titTunaToastWeeknightRecipes you want to make.
