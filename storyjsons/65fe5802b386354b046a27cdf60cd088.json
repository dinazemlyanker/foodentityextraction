(Hint: It\u2019s even cooler than their Insta-favorite a few minutes away.) Anchored near the modern art museum right off the touristy Nyhavn canal, Apollo offers a well-edited menu with several ways to enjoy some of the best bread in town, whether it\u2019s with whipped butter or mascarpone.ORDER THE: Comt\u00e9 with bread; ricotta with olive oil and berries; ceviche of the day; and matcha-dusted \u201cKermit cake.\u201d  Natural wines, cocktails, healthy juices, matcha (no lattes, thanks), and house-made shrubs round out the drinks.THE VIBE IS: student art league clubhouse in early \u201860s Eastern Europe, from the life-size classical sculptures to the paint-encrusted chairs. Diners range from Caf\u00e9 Atelier September regulars to befuddled museum tourists. And come summer, the courtyard seating is the place to be. Make sure to shop the bookstore and, if you\u2019re really lucky, you\u2019ll be there for the monthly flea market!PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Tuesday, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Wednesday to Friday, 8 a.m. to midnight; Saturday, 10 a.m. to midnight; and Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Closed Monday. Book online, just to be safe.\u2014Christine MuhlkePhoto by Ditte IsagerPhoto by Ditte IsagerWE ALSO LOVESlurp Ramen JointObsessively, meticulously made ramen that\u2019s got people lining up in Indre ByRestaurant Pal\u00e6gadeHead to Indre By to eat all the open-face sandwiches (and herring)Ved Stranden 10Get lost in natural wines at this living room-esque Indre By barExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
