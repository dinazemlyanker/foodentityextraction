Have you ever daydreamed about one? Have you ever let your mind wander around its smashed, crispy edges and creamy, starchy center, instead of absorbing whatever essential information your boss was trying to convey to you? Have you ever written poetry for a spud?No?Of course not. Same. Definitely same. That would be...silly. Who would develop an emotional attachment to a dish of potatoes? Not me, that\u2019s for sure. Not even if there was a bed of sour cream or some walnut dressing involved. Not even if the potatoes were divinely crispy. Definitely not me.But let\u2019s say I did, for the sake of conversation. If I did fall for a plate of potatoes, in a totally hypothetical scenario, it would be these crispy potatoes with walnut dressing. They are absolutely delicious. And beautiful.This dish is essentially the crispiest, smashed potatoes you can imagine, placed on a generous swoosh of sour cream and topped with a nutty, umami-rich dressing that would be good on just about anything. It covers all of the bases: creamy, starchy, salty, earthy, bright, and sweet. And it balances all of those aspects in a way where none of them dominates. They coexist in a utopian society. Not a cult-ish utopia. A normal one. Like I said, it\u2019s beautiful.How do the potatoes get so crispy? And what goes into this dressing to make it that good? Well, the potatoes get crisped up with a two-step cooking process. First, you simmer them for about 15 minutes in salty water. They get barely tender enough to smash. Once they\u2019re all cool, lying out on a rimmed sheet pan, you take another sheet pan and push down on the potatoes, smashing them all in one quick motion. It\u2019s super cool, a true smashing hack. You then toss the potatoes in olive oil, salt, and pepper, and throw the sheet pan into a 450\u00b0 oven. Let them roast for about 35\u201340 minutes.LOOK AT THOSE BEAUTIES!!!\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Styling by Molly BazFor the dressing, we have to cook a couple things while those potatoes roast. It\u2019s not a big deal. Don\u2019t complain. It\u2019s easy. You cook some walnuts and anchovies in olive oil for about five minutes in a skillet. You transfer that to a bowl and mix it with chile flakes, grated garlic, and salt. If you\u2019re thinking, Damn, that would be so good on roasted carrots. Or some grilled chicken. Or blistered snap peas. Or maybe even a shaved vegetable salad. Congratulations. You\u2019re right. It\u2019s good on basically anything. Your award will arrive in the mail in 5\u20138 business days.Those taters are finished. (Can I say taters? Do people like that? Who knows? Who cares? I like that word. Taters.) Lay down a big ol\u2019 bed of sour cream all over a large plate. Scatter the crispy potatoes on top, and spoon that walnut dressing over them. Scatter some freshly torn herbs on top, because you\u2019re the type of person who does that. And serve the whole thing with some halved lemons, so anyone who needs a an extra hit of acid (not that kind) has it. Look at those potatoes. Look at their glory.So yeah, here\u2019s the recipe:Crispy Smashed Potatoes With Walnut DressingAnd on top? A condiment made up of walnuts, anchovies, garlic, and red pepper flakes that\u2019s the ultimate umami bomb.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titSour CreamWalnutPotatoRecipes you want to make.
