When something\u2019s so easy to make that you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.What lockdown food will you be happiest to take with you into the post-pandemic world? Would it be sourdough? Banana bread? Dalgona coffee? The answer for me is a trend that hasn\u2019t quite hit mainland American shores in the same way\u2014yet. It\u2019s the sushi bake, and if there\u2019s one lockdown food I\u2019ll be happy to make on repeat when I finally relinquish sweatpants for real jeans, it\u2019s this one.What is a sushi bake?Imagine a California-style roll, but deconstructed, layered, and baked in a casserole format: Seasoned rice is topped with furikake rice seasoning, a creamy, spicy mayo-laden seafood layer, more furikake, and drizzles of mayonnaise and Sriracha, and then it all gets heated up in the oven. After it comes out, let it cool long enough to set before spooning out portions onto seasoned Korean-style dried seaweed or gim (a.k.a. the roasted seaweed snack you might find in stores like Trader Joe\u2019s) with optional garnishes of cucumber and avocado.Where did the sushi bake come from?I first started noticing sushi bakes on my social media feeds in the early summer of 2020, with the majority of the videos and images coming from the Philippines, where sushi bake had taken off in the early days of lockdown. It wasn\u2019t only all the rage in home kitchens\u2014there also seemed to be plenty of homegrown shops selling sushi bakes via pickup and delivery in and around the capital of Manila.\u201cWhen the quarantine started, my sister and I re-created recipes from TikTok and other social media platforms,\u201d says Leiana Aika Go, who started Manila-based Sushi Lab with her sister, Debbie Ann Go. \u201cThe kitchen became our laboratory. It was an avenue for us to experiment with different flavors from sweet to savory. When the sushi bake craze went viral, we tried making one of our own, and it turned out to be so good that we decided we had to share it with others.\u201dThe sushi bake has all the hallmarks of a great dish waiting to be brought to a potluck (remember those?): highly shareable; delicious warm; rich and creamy. And while parties of the usual kind aren\u2019t condoned in the current environment, food that\u2019s big on comfort and fun, to enjoy with your household pod, is welcome.\u201cFilipinos love to eat rice and share a good meal with their loved ones,\u201d says Pamela Chuateco, the chef and owner of Taste & Tell, whose sushi bake trays are inspired by Japanese aburi-style, or flame-seared, sushi. \u201cGiven that everyone is spending so much time at home with their families due to quarantine protocol, the sushi trays have become such a big hit because it\u2019s a really easy meal to share with the whole family.\u201dAccording to my friend and former colleague Rebekah Daniels, who grew up in Hawaii, sushi bake isn\u2019t new and she\u2019s always known it as an easy, crowd-pleasing party dish. \u201cIt seemed to always be a staple dish during holidays or special occasions,\u201d she tells me. \u201cAnd even in a more casual setting, it would be at a party or potluck since it was something that was meant to be shared with people. I\u2019m sure that there are restaurants or places that will sell you trays of sushi bakes, but in my experience, they have always been homemade, often served cold or at room temp, or be placed in the oven for a bit so that it has a warm and melty texture.\u201d (In my own research, I also found several delicious-looking uncooked renditions of the sushi casserole, in the form of a \u201cpan sushi\u201d and a \u201cpoke pan sushi\u201d on beloved Hawaii grocery chain Foodland\u2019s own site.)Photo by Laura Murray, Food Styling by Pearl JonesIt quickly became apparent in my search that there\u2019s a sushi bake to suit every taste. While imitation crab usually makes up the bulk of the seafood layer, there are countless versions that mix in cooked salmon, shrimp, scallops, eel, fish roe, and more. Sushi Lab in the Philippines offers non-seafood fillings like rib-eye steak on the menu, while Taste & Tell incorporates ingredients including mango, fried garlic chips, and fried salmon skin in a variety of its aburi trays. \u201cThe fun thing about making this,\u201d Daniels says, \u201cis that you never need a recipe! Everything is to taste.\u201dBack in the continental U.S., it wasn't long before I started hearing of sushi bake services cropping up, including in my own friend group.\u201cI could see sushi bakes becoming more commonplace in the States, whether it\u2019s with home cooks or from businesses like mine,\u201d says Gia Lee, who calls her Chicago-area Hot Box Sushi a \u201cCOVID baby.\u201d Lee, who grew up in Manila, started her take-and-bake casserole business over the summer of 2020, anticipating that the popularity of the food trend would hit the mainland. \u201cWith dining out at restaurants no longer being an easy option, people are really looking for unique experiences they can enjoy at home.\u201dWhat will the fate of sushi bake be, once the pandemic is over and some semblance of \u201cnormal\u201d returns? Time will tell but Leiana Aika Go of Sushi Lab has a feeling they\u2019re here to stay. \u201cHonestly, we never really thought of [the trend] lasting this long,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIt has unexpectedly caught the Filipino palate.\u201d Go believes sushi bakes will join the ranks of the traditional lechon and adobo that are often served on special occasions.Here\u2019s how I make a sushi bake:In learning about sushi bake, I\u2019ve tried different versions and I\u2019ve finally settled on one that suits my household perfectly.Start by making 2 cups uncooked sushi rice according to package or rice cooker directions (if you use the small plastic measuring cup that comes with your rice cooker, it will be about 2\u00be of these cups)\u2014you want 5\u20135\u00bd cups cooked rice. Once the rice is cooked, transfer to a large bowl. Add 1 tsp. toasted sesame oil (optional), and carefully mix and keep covered with a clean kitchen towel while you proceed with the recipe.Heat oven to 400\u00b0F.In a large bowl, combine 1 pound imitation crab meat, separated and chopped into small but not minuscule pieces, 1\u20132 Tbsp. Sriracha, 3\u20134 scallions, finely chopped, 3 Tbsp. masago or tobiko (fish roe), and 1 cup Kewpie mayo. While many recipes rely on some combination of mayonnaise and sour cream or mayonnaise and cream cheese as the primary binder, I prefer Kewpie (a rich, slightly sweet Japanese mayonnaise) for the best flavor, without being over-the-top heavy. Combine crab mixture thoroughly, but gently.Add your rice to a 9x13\" baking or casserole dish. Press down firmly, but not too tightly, in an even layer. Sprinkle about \u2153 of one 1.7-ounce bottle of furikake rice seasoning across the top of the rice.Add the imitation crab mixture on top of the furikake layer. Again, press firmly (not tightly) and evenly. Sprinkle another \u2153 of the furikake bottle on top of this mixture.Using the fine tip of the Kewpie bottle, garnish the top of the sushi bake in a zigzag pattern. Repeat the zigzag pattern from the opposite direction with the Sriracha bottle. Using your finger or the tip of a butter knife, sprinkle 1 Tbsp. of masago or tobiko on top of the sushi bake. I love using masago or tobiko fish roe in the imitation crab mix and to top the sushi bake because it adds salty brininess as well as a nice pop of texture.Bake in the oven for 15\u201320 minutes, until the top gets a light golden brown. If you\u2019re using a glass pan, you may see the edges of the rice start to sizzle (that\u2019s a good thing!).Remove from the oven and let cool for 5\u201310 minutes. Serve with about 3\u20134 packages seasoned, roasted Korean seaweed snack (a.k.a. gim), sliced cucumber, and sliced avocado. You\u2019ll spoon a small portion onto the roasted seaweed sheet and it will resemble a mini taco of sorts. Cucumber adds a much-needed crunch and cooling respite and avocado's inherent creaminess pairs well too\u2014it\u2019s even better if it's cold from the fridge. Refrigerate any leftovers. Reheat in a 325\u00b0F oven for about 10\u201415 minutes.This is not traditional sushi as you know it, but if you\u2019ve ever enjoyed an American-style spicy roll, I have a strong feeling you will also enjoy the sushi bake. Having tested the following recipe more than a handful of times for a rapt crowd (my husband and six-year-old), I can safely say it\u2019s already become a family favorite.While I would recommend following my version of sushi bake as written the first time around, I\u2019d encourage you to customize it to your and your household\u2019s tastes moving forward. Use this extra time at home now to perfect your sushi bake so that when we can eventually gather with others again for a real potluck, you\u2019ll know exactly what your contribution will be.Hana Asbrink is a writer, editor, and recipe developer based in New York.
