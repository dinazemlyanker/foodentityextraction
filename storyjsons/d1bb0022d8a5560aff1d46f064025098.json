In fact, in her new autobiography, All In, she describes hitting with Rod Laver and Margaret Smith as the \u201creal-time version of that party question, \u2018If you could have dinner with any three people in tennis history, who would you choose?\u2019\u201d And yet, when I asked her nearly that exact question, she didn\u2019t want to pick just three people. Or rather, she couldn\u2019t. She\u2019s too interested in what makes other people tick to leave anyone out. So welcome, instead, to Billie Jean King\u2019s Dream Open House.I have to ask: When it comes to food, which is best\u2014Wimbledon, the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, or Roland-Garros?Wimbledon has strawberries and cream and the strawberries are at their best [that time of year]. I always liked [Roland-Garros]. With French food, can you go wrong? Oh, my God, that bread. At the U.S. Open, I\u2019m thinking of the hot dogs.Say you\u2019re hosting your dream party. Who would cook?\u00a0I don\u2019t cook. And my partner doesn\u2019t cook. But we are champions of takeout. We live in New York City and are very big on supporting small family restaurants. I usually order from Swagat, this local Indian place. I eat there sometimes five days a week. I love the salmon [which is marinated in ginger, yogurt, and garlic] and the cauliflower.Would you do takeout for the dinner party?\u00a0We\u2019ll choose a private room in a restaurant if it\u2019s business-related. I\u2019ve got the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative, which is nonprofit, and also Billie Jean King Enterprises, which is for-profit. I want to make lots of money so I can invest it back into communities that need it. But if it\u2019s just for fun, yes, takeout from Swagat at our apartment.What\u2019s the vibe?\u00a0At home it\u2019s laid-back. We have to work a lot and that\u2019s when you get dressed, wear makeup, the whole nine yards. So this is casual. I love Italian Deruta dishes. I\u2019ve had them forever, in different patterns.If you could only invite three people, who gets invited? Other tennis players?No, I don\u2019t think about players. I think about science. I\u2019d invite Sally Ride. She\u2019s passed now, but she was the first American woman astronaut back in \u201983 and a good friend. I love Walter Isaacson\u2019s book on Leonardo da Vinci. Every time I go up on an airplane, I say, \u201cThis one\u2019s for you, Leonardo!\u201d Amanda Gorman would be fantastic. Greta Thunberg too. Also Ellen Ochoa. She\u2019s an engineer and the first Hispanic woman to go out in space. Nelson Mandela. And then I tell you, who I absolutely love and I don\u2019t have the courage to call \u2019cause I\u2019m such a wimp is Nikole Hannah-Jones with her \u201c1619 Project.\u201d That was amazing. The Obamas, Jackie Robinson and his wife, Rachel. My dad played against Robinson in California! And\u2014I have to interrupt you here or else we won\u2019t have room for the other questions.\u00a0\u2014Bayard Rustin, James Baldwin. And Susan Williams. In fifth grade, she\u2019s sitting next to me and says, \u201cYou want to play tennis?\u201d Back then I asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Every morning I do a gratitude list, and I always thank Susan.You\u2019ve been a leader in pay equity in sports and a mentor to generations of female athletes. At the dinner, someone asks about leadership style and what traits characterize successful people. What do you say?\u00a0Relationships are everything to them, they keep learning how to learn, and they are problem solvers and innovators.\u00a0Traits you have yourself, Billie.Explore Bon App\u00e9titDream Dinner PartyInterviewsCultureRead MorecultureMindy Kaling Would Only Have One Guest at Her Dream Dinner PartyBy Dawn DaviscultureStacey Abrams on the Secret Ingredient to Great CheesecakeBy Dawn DavisRecipes you want to make.
