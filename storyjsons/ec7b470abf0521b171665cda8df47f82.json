Crispy golden crullers. Steaming vats of rich noodle soup. With a Taiwanese-American as his guide, photographer Alex Lau shows us what a long weekend in Asia\u2019s most underrated food city looks (and tastes) like.By Sue LiMay 20, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailIn Taipei you can eat out-of-this-world soup dumplings with skin so thin it\u2019s almost translucent, like you\u2019d find in Shanghai. Mouth-numbing noodles with crunchy chili oil, like in Sichuan. The crispiest Peking duck with shattering skin just as good as in Beijing. But the capital of Taiwan, a small autonomous nation in the shadow of China, also has a cuisine all its own. Steaming bowls of beef noodle soup with meat so tender it\u2019ll melt in your mouth. Finely shaved ice dotted with chewy tapioca balls and drizzled with sweetened condensed milk. It\u2019s one of the reasons I return regularly to the city I was born in. My brother, parents, and I emigrated from Taipei to north Texas in 1990, trading our language and the city\u2019s colorful alleys for strip malls and pickup trucks. Each time I return I am delighted and surprised by my hometown. And I love to introduce my friends to the city, which is how BA\u2019s Alex Lau ended up with me on a whirlwind 72-hour tour, watching vendors roll out flaky flatbread at 5 a.m. and sampling stinky tofu after dusk and capturing it all on film.Photo by Alex LauBubble TeaBefore your mom said she was \u201cinto\u201d bubble tea, it was on street corners all over the city (this one\u2019s from Qi Li Ting Teahouse).Photo by Alex LauDongmen MarketWet markets with fish, meat, etc., are as worthy a stop as the famed night markets. Don\u2019t be afraid of the aggressive grandmas\u2014they\u2019re just shopping for dinner.Photo by Alex LauChinese BreakfastStart savory with soy milk (flavored with vinegar and soy sauce), crullers for dipping, and flatbread at Yong He Soy Milk King.Photo by Alex LauTea TastingIf you\u2019re the type who samples every ice cream flavor before committing, you\u2019ll love tea shopping in Taipei. Dong Tai, or most any tea store, will invite you to a tasting, offering snacks like salted plums with the oolong.Photo by Alex LauElephant MountainThe steps will seem endless, but the view of the skyline is worth it.Photo by Alex LauBeef Noodle SoupEvery shop claims its version of the Taiwanese staple is the best. Only Liu Shandong Beef Noodles is right.Photo by Alex LauBreakfast PrepJust join the line snaking down the sidewalk at Yong He Soy Milk King. You\u2019re there for the traditional Chinese breakfast, while others are queueing up to fill their Zojirushi thermoses with soy milk for their families back home.Photo by Alex LauShaved IceYou know those hot, steamy days when you want to stick your head in a freezer? Taipei has a lot of those. And shaved-ice desserts are a tastier option than the freezer. Ice Monster takes a modern approach, topping snowy shaved ice with fresh fruit and soft panna cotta. If that\u2019s not enough sugar (but it probably is), add a bit of the sweetened condensed milk that comes on the side.Photo by Alex LauMr. Liu, Noodle ProThe move at the nearly 70-year-old Liu Shandong Beef Noodles: Get the clear broth beef noodle soup and deck it out with a big spoonful of pickled mustard greens, a sprinkle of fermented black beans, and nibbles of raw garlic between bites.Photo by Alex LauTonghua Night MarketNight markets are essential to any visitor\u2019s experience, but this is one of the older, less-touristy options. The trick is to sample widely, eat a few bites, and move on (nothing is more than a few dollars). Don\u2019t miss the stinky tofu with fermented cabbage (just try it!), fried squid on a stick, and sweet sesame dumplings.Photo by Alex LauSun Yat-Sen Memorial HallFollow the cool kids in their Supreme sweatshirts to this park where they\u2019ll dance to K-pop for hours. These college students probably would\u2019ve performed until dark if the guy with the boom box didn\u2019t have to go home.Photo by Alex LauRice Noodle SoupWalk to the end of a winding alley in the Dongmen Market to find Mama Luo\u2019s Rice Noodle Soup shop. Get the rice noodle soup (the pork bone broth has been simmering for hours) with a side of tofu and lightly blanched greens. Sprinkle with white pepper and a few dashes of rice vinegar.Photo by Alex LauGrass Jelly Shaved IceWe\u2019re not ones to use the word mouthfeel, but this dessert is truly a study in textures. Jiggly grass jelly (a slightly herbal gelatin) meets flaky shaved ice, chunky sweet red beans and peanuts, chewy tapioca and taro balls, and a thimble of rich coffee creamer. Get it at Ice in Wonderland.Photo by Alex LauRice PorridgeRice porridge/congee spots are popular late-night destinations (but they may not all have servers this happy). Join the cab drivers and clubbers at Xiaolizi Rice Porridge, pick up a tray, and choose your dishes, like stewed eggplant or braised tofu. Take a seat and your waiter will bring a pot of rice porridge, a blank canvas for your selections.Photo by Alex LauSoup DumplingsVisitors line up for hours to score a table at the now-international Din Tai Fung. Which makes sense: Its soup dumplings are perfect.Explore Bon App\u00e9titTaiwanTaipeiRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
