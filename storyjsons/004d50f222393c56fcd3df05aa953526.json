Here is something else about me: Hot dogs make my stomach hurt. I think it might have something to do with nitrates, and/or the fact that I can never seem to eat just one (picture one of those old-timey cartoons where a dog runs off with a whole string of sausage links\u2014that dog is me). Whatever the reason, my digestive system, usually a reliable old girl, simply cannot handle the things. Over the years, I\u2019ve tried learning to love tofu dogs (bleh!) and opting for burgers instead (okay, fine), but in my heart remained a hot-dog-shaped hole. Or, more precisely, in my stomach remained a dull burning sensation caused by the several processed meat tubes I still couldn\u2019t stop myself from eating at the cookout.That is, until the day I came across Kvar\u00f8y Arctic Salmon Hot Dogs.At first, I thought what you are probably thinking: Why. But then I shrugged, throwing caution to the wind and a two-pack into my basket. What did I have to lose?Turns out, nothing but the stomach pains. Believe it or not, the fatty, velvety texture of the salmon makes it an excellent substitute for beef or pork, and a clever casing made with fish keratin means these dogs even have a little bit of that quintessential snap to them. The salmon flavor is present but subtle; balance it out with one of their infused options\u2014like jalape\u00f1o and Jarlsberg cheese (my personal favorite)\u2014and you may forget you\u2019re actually eating fish at all. I like to brown them on the grill, squeeze on some grainy mustard and horseradish, and watch my Oscar-Meyer FOMO fade faster than that sausage-toting terrier fleeing the scene of the crime.Honestly though, I\u2019d recommend these babies even if your stomach can tolerate normal wieners. Because did I mention that they\u2019re also really good for you? We\u2019re talking a full weekly recommended allowance of heart-healthy Omega-3\u2019s in one serving. Plus, they\u2019re better for the planet: Kvar\u00f8y\u2019s salmon is sustainably farmed in Norway and uses blockchain technology for sourcing transparency. Their salmon burgers and hot dogs are made with the trimmings and off-cuts from the production of their fillets, meaning that by eating them you are actively reducing food waste rather than adding to it.Hot dogs with a side of smug.
