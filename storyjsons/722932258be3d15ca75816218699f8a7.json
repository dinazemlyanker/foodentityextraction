A true connoisseur, the thinking goes, seeks out dark chocolate\u2014the darker the better!\u2014and leaves milk chocolate to dilettantes and babies.But let\u2019s take a minute and unpack that. While a lot of milk chocolate just so happens to be poor quality, milk chocolate itself is not the problem. The zeitgeist tells us that we \u201cshould\u201d prefer dark chocolate much the same as we should prefer wine, coffee, and whiskey with flavor profiles that run toward the extreme. But sometimes I just want to eat something accessible and enjoyable without embarking on a cerebral tasting exercise. Somewhere in between 100% cacao\u2014which, let\u2019s be real, no one wants\u2014and crappy milk chocolate, there\u2019s something that delivers on quality and flavor but is still approachable. For me that\u2019s Fruition Chocolate Works\u2019 68% dark milk chocolate bar.Claire Saffitz introduced me to Fruition, a small chocolatier in an unlikely location in upstate New York, when I was looking for some really nice chocolate to gift to my wife for Christmas one year. My wife is English and grew up eating Dairy Milk and Flakes and Twirls, so while she loves dark chocolate, she also has a soft spot for the milkier stuff. Fruition\u2019s milk chocolate offerings include a brown butter bar and one that contains Peruvian salt, but my favorite is the dark milk, which is made with cacao from Peru\u2019s Mara\u00f1\u00f3n Canyon. Often with single origin chocolate, the producer leans into the fruitiness or the acidity, which can be interesting from a culinary perspective but isn\u2019t necessarily what I crave when I want chocolate. But Fruition\u2019s dark milk is balanced and incredibly satisfying.At around $10 for a 60 gram bar, Fruition isn\u2019t cheap, but its price is on par with most other specialty chocolates, and we are talking about a bar of chocolate that, in my opinion, is the absolute best that can be obtained by mere mortals. It\u2019s beautiful chocolate. And yes, it\u2019s milk.Fruition Chocolate Dark Milk Chocolate Bar$10 at Fruition Chocolate Works$13 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make.
