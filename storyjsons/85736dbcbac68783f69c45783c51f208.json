Steak and Eggs with Saucy Beans Are What\u2019s For DinnerThe diner staple gets an upgrade with creamy beans, a smoky rub, and sweet charred limes.By Hilary CadiganJanuary 9, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Sue Li, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiFacebookTwitterEmailSerious question: Is there any meal better than breakfast for dinner? If you answered yes then I\u2019m sorry but you are wrong. Very wrong. But don\u2019t take it too hard. We all make mistakes. What I have for you here is salvation of sorts. What I have for you here is Steak and Eggs with Saucy Beans.See, I\u2019m one of those people. The ones who struggle with mornings. I hit snooze twelve times, wake in a panic, throw on whatever sweater I find on the ground, chug a scalding coffee, then sprint out the door as the last train getting me to work on time pulls out of the station. I never have time to eat breakfast. And that makes me very sad. But you know what cheers me up? Yes, you do. Having breakfast for dinner.Packed full o\u2019 protein and heavy on the flavor, this particular breakfast for dinner is an excellent example of the form. It\u2019s also a serious upgrade on the typical greasy laminated placemat iteration of steak-n-eggs, she of the tough under-seasoned meat and gelatinous scrambies. And making it is so easy that I might even consider waking up a little earli\u2014lol jk. It\u2019s dinner. Let\u2019s talk strategy.First, you grab a couple of fine New York strip steaks and rub \u2018em all over with a fiery blend of hot smoked paprika, Aleppo-style pepper, salt, and black pepper. This is the perfect cheat-rub for making quick pan-seared steak taste like it spent quality time on a grill when it\u2019s too cold to grill outside. Let it sit and soak while you focus on those saucy, saucy beans.This part is simple: Saut\u00e9 some shallots, garlic, and fresh cilantro stems (yes, they\u2019re edible and you should never waste them!) until soft. Then add a can of pinto beans. On that subject, here\u2019s some potentially unexpected advice from the Test Kitchen: For the best flavor, skip the \u201cno salt added\u201d beans and opt for a classic pre-seasoned brand like Goya. The beans pick up more flavor the first time they\u2019re cooked (yes, in the factory) and it\u2019s hard to get them to Ideal Saltiness Level once that opportunity\u2019s been passed up. That said, definitely drain and rinse your beans\u2014ain\u2019t nobody got time for that mucous-y, preservative-filled can gloop.Next, add butter and water (to make up for the missing can gloop\u2014you still need liquid), and let those beans simmer \u2018til incorporated and saucy. Then remove them from the heat and stir in the leaves from those cilantro stems you didn\u2019t waste. Sprinkle them with a bit of lime zest and half a lime\u2019s worth of juice. Done. Cover them so they don\u2019t get cold.Now: Steak, which gets cooked on a skillet (definitely opt for cast iron if you have it) for three minutes on each side. Here\u2019s where things get craaaa-zy: Add a couple of halved limes to your skillet. Yeah. We went there. See, charring citrus is a great way to transform its sharp acidity into something more mellow and sweet. The cooking oil in the pan will suck those flavors right up into the meat, which will then get a double dose once you squeeze those sweet limey juices all over it after plating.Then come the eggs: Cooked sunny side up in the same skillet until their edges get lacy and brown and perfect. And that is it, folks! Spread the steak on a pretty slab of wood with the cut limes artfully scattered about, and slide an egg atop your plate. And suddenly, you\u2019ll realize something. All those sanctimonious early birds? They can keep their slimy worms. We\u2019ve got steak. And eggs. And the sauciest beans in town.Get the recipe:Steak and Eggs with Saucy BeansThe diner classic gets a boost from a pot of zesty, creamy beans and sweet charred limes.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titDinnerRecipes you want to make.
