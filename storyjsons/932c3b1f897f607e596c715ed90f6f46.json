I mean, how good could airplane food be (even it was being served in the big, cushy seats up front)? But then last summer, on my way back from L.A., there I was, staring down a BLT. Like, a real BLT\u2014two slices of griddled Pullman loaf, crisp, thick-cut bacon, plump tomatoes, little gem lettuce, and homemade aioli. Oh, and homemade potato chips on the side, no less. Jon and Vinny (which is what everyone calls them in L.A., and they even run two hugely successful Jon & Vinny\u2019s restaurants) hooked up with Delta last summer. They now produce nearly 800 meals a day in a catering facility in Inglewood for the carrier\u2019s Delta One flights from LAX to JFK, Boston and D.C., as well as destinations as far flung as Sydney and Paris. They use all the same purveyors and farmers market favorites as they do for their numerous restaurants around the city. But, as detailed below, with their signature meatballs in pomodoro\u2014a must-order both at Jon & Vinny\u2019s and on Delta\u2014 they face challenges that no earth-bound chef would ever have to deal with. Here\u2019s how they manage.The AppetizerEverything Shook and Dotolo serve on Delta One they make from scratch, which equates to more control over quality and costs. Here they hot-smoke Coho salmon in-house, blast-chill it, then break it into slabs for a rustic look.The BreadFocaccia is baked and grilled at the duo\u2019s catering facility, then rubbed with a chile-garlic butter once cooled to protect the bread against its worst enemy (drying out) with a layer of fat.Shook and Dotolo outside of their catering facility in L.A.\nThe MeatballsHow do flight attendants fit all those little trays in their carts? No dish can be taller than two inches. \u201cOtherwise the meatballs are the same as what we serve at Jon & Vinny\u2019s,\u201d Shook says. \u201cBrisket and pork shoulder, with pomodoro made from cans of Bianco DiNapoli organic crushed tomatoes and served with a dollop of ricotta and garlic bread.\u201dThe SaladSupplying Delta with 1,200 meals a day means lots of salad, which translates to 50 cases of crisp Little Gem lettuce sourced from the Santa Monica and Hollywood farmers\u2019 markets twice a week.The Dressing\u201cSince food is stored at cold temperatures on the plane, olive oil congeals,\u201d Dotolo explains.
