However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.The link between red roses and romantic love dates at least as far back as ancient Greece, when it was said that Aphrodite, goddess of beauty, pricked her ankle on a white rose as she rushed to Adonis, her dying lover. The white rose instantly turned red, and red roses became forevermore inextricably linked with the intensity of her love. It would, however, take until the 17th century for roses to become the Valentine\u2019s Day gift, and while few things set a heart aflutter like a dozen long-stemmed roses, there\u2019s no reason to stop there: It\u2019s time to think beyond the bouquet.
