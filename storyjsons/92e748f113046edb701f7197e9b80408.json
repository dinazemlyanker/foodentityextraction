It calls for boxed chicken stock, even though you\u2019re essentially making your own by boiling the raw chicken, and it uses orzo, a pasta shape that will cause many editors here to make a face like they just bit into a sour lemon. Here\u2019s the thing: I don\u2019t care. Maybe it\u2019s because I have fond memories of my mom making it for me when I\u2019d come home from college. Or maybe because it\u2019s truly the simplest, most comforting chicken soup ever. Either way, it never lets me down.It\u2019s sort of a cross between a chicken noodle soup and Greek avgolemono. It has all the comforting celery and dill flavors of a classic chicken soup plus the hit of lemon you can expect from avgolemono. Except you can make it in 30 minutes flat.To make it, you cook down sliced leeks and celery, add in chicken and boxed broth (sorry, Test Kitchen crew!), season, and bring all that to a boil. Hang out for 20 minutes, then transfer the cooked chicken to a plate and shred it up. Add orzo to the broth and let that lil\u2019 pasta cook for 8 or so minutes. Remove from heat, stir your chicken back in, add a lot of dill, squeeze in some lemon juice, and crack some fresh pepper on top. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the recipe.I recently made the soup in my own kitchen, across the country from the kitchen from where my mom would make it for me, and it was just as comforting as ever. It might not obey all the current rules that the Test Kitchen editors abide by, but it holds up. Yes, nostalgia is a pretty good seasoning. But so is a handful of dill, a squeeze of lemon, and a crack of black pepper.Get the recipe:Lemony Chicken and Orzo SoupThis weeknight chicken soup goes Greek with orzo, lemon juice, and a handful of fresh dill.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titNever FailRecipes you want to make.
