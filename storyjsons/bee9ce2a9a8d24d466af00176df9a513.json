It's so weird and easy, and it makes your food taste like restaurant food, because only restaurants would mix prunes and tarragon and kimchi brine, and have it come out crazy delicious. I've made it twice now, both times with grilled fish, and even my 14-year-old ate it!! Just trust me and make it. You are going to freak out.AbbyLos Angeles, CA10/11/2021This was an unexpected hit! I spread onto rock cod before baking in parchment and kept some aside to finish with. Didn\u2019t have brine so used extra vinegar. Also skipped the tarragon (because quarantine grocery shopping). Could imagine this being great with dried apricots or even currants, but the prune and pistachio combo was really spot on. marydenhamSan Anselmo, CA7/28/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSauceCondimentPistachioNutPruneDried FruitFruitParsleyHerbs & SpicesMintQuickEasyVeganVegetarianDairy-FreeGluten-FreeHealthyishRecipes you want to make.
