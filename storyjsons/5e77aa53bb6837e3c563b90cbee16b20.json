If not, slice the shoulder crosswise into 4 equal pieces. Pounding the meat both tenderizes it and allows for a very quick cook time: a win-win for a weeknight meal.Ingredients4 servings 1cup fresh cherries4tsp. unseasoned rice vinegar, dividedKosher salt, freshly ground pepper1\u00bclb. pork shoulder (Boston butt), cut into 4 steaks\u00becup all-purpose flour3large eggs2Tbsp. Dijon mustard, plus more for serving3cups panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)1Tbsp. plus 1\u00bd tsp. fennel seeds1cup vegetable oil1large fennel bulb, cut in half lengthwise, thinly sliced, fronds reserved1lemon, halved lengthwise\u00bdcup torn basil leavesPreparationStep 1Place cherries in a large resealable plastic bag and lightly crush with the palm of your hand to extract pits. Tear cherries into large pieces and transfer to a small bowl; discard pits. Add 2 tsp. vinegar and season with salt and pepper. Set aside for serving.Step 2Working one at a time, place steaks in another large resealable plastic bag and pound to \u00bc\" thick. Place flour in a shallow bowl; season with salt and pepper. Lightly beat eggs and 2 Tbsp. mustard in another shallow bowl. Toss together panko and fennel seeds in a third shallow bowl.Step 3Season each cutlet with salt and pepper, then dredge in flour, shaking off excess. Transfer to bowl with egg mixture and turn to coat. Lift from bowl, allowing excess to drip off. Coat with panko mixture, pressing to adhere.Step 4Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Working in batches, cook cutlets, shaking pan occasionally, until golden brown and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet; season with salt.Step 5Place fennel in a large bowl; squeeze \u00bd lemon over. Cut remaining lemon half into 4 wedges and set aside for serving. Drizzle fennel with remaining 2 tsp. vinegar and season with salt and lots of black pepper. Toss, squeezing once or twice with your hands to help soften fennel. Add basil and gently toss again.Step 6Divide cutlets among plates and top with fennel salad, fennel fronds, and reserved cherries. Serve with more mustard and reserved lemon wedges.How would you rate Crispy Pork Cutlets with Fennel Salad?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (3)Back to TopTriangleShould've used a chop instead of shoulder. Turned out tough as shoe leather. The fennel and cherries are delicious.
