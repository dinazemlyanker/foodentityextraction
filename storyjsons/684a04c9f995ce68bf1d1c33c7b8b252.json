On the one hand, our Instagram feeds love pictures of ice cream so much that someone built an entire museum for us to take them in. But, at the same time, sales of actual ice cream are slumping: Halo Top\u2019s low-calorie cartons are outselling big-name brands at Wal-Mart, and Ben and Jerry\u2019s recently introduced new vegan flavors to its roster.And it\u2019s not just ice cream that\u2019s earning its health halo while looking decadent. Thousands of Instagram bakers swear that we can stay on our paleo, Whole 30, or gluten-free diets without having to give up on dessert as long as we\u2019re willing to put black beans in our brownies and substitute dates for caramel. Even Christina Tosi, mini-chain Milk Bar\u2019s Queen of the Rainbow Sprinkle, High Priestess of Crack Pie, has gotten in on the action with SoulFuel, a \u201cprotein packed\u201d gluten- and dairy-free cookie she helped create in collaboration with the indoor cycling studio SoulCycle.Wellness Instagrammers promising that carob taste like candy, and dessert chefs creating cookies that are good for your gut: It\u2019s enough to make anyone ask: Why are we so obsessed with making dessert healthy? And why do we keep turning healthy foods into dessert?Milkbar's Soulfuel cookie\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig\u201cAll any dieting person really wants\u2014and I am extrapolating from personal experience here\u2014is to eat a whole container of something,\u201d Heather Schwedel recently wrote for Slate in a piece about the rise of Halo Top. \u201cPreferably that thing will taste good or at least not bad, but what\u2019s crucial, in the end, is getting to eat all of it.\u201d Halo Top and other \u201chealthy desserts\u201d swap out the pleasure of eating something delicious with the promise that you can eat gallons of it. One of Halo Top\u2019s slogans, Schwedel points out, is no bowl, no regrets.The suggestion that we don\u2019t have to worry about portion control is super enticing in a moment when people are embarrassed about dieting. Instead of counting points or calories, we talk vaguely about cleansing, resetting, and \u201cplant-based\u201d living.It\u2019s undeniable that Healthyish is part of this universe. It\u2019s a site that claims that \u201chealthy should be delicious.\u201d You can find recipes here for fudgy bliss balls, tahini brownies, and breakfast cookies. (Though a site by Bon App\u00e9tit would never pitch these recipes as replacements for the real thing. Have you tried BA\u2019s brown butter and toffee chocolate chip cookie?!)The problem is with our expectations of ourselves and our desires. If we were only concerned about our health, we would eat vegetables; if we only wanted to enjoy ourselves, we\u2019d eat pasta for breakfast, lunch, and dinner (just me?). Instead we seek a middle ground, which is often called wellness: the understanding that health is best achieved through a holistic suite of practices and habits, not singular, obsessive obedience.Which is a good, useful framework for us to have! Less useful, however, is the assumption that the coveted wellness we\u2019re all searching for can be found within a pint of low-calorie ice cream, a gluten/dairy/soy/egg-free brownie, or a protein-laden cookie.The SoulFuel press release tells us that this protein-rich cookie will help us achieve the \u201cbalancing act of having it all.\u201d But, as any feminist knows, \u201chaving it all\u201d is a joke and a lie: There\u2019s no \u201call\u201d and nothing to be \u201chad.\u201d Health has to be calibrated and navigated day by day, decision by decision. No product, diet, or routine will ever let us off the hook. Not only is the notion of \u201chaving it all\u201d impossible, it\u2019s also damaging. It sets us up to blame ourselves for not achieving whatever peak state we\u2019re told is out there. We end up feeling like failures for eating something \u201cbad,\u201d for not having self control. We deprive ourselves as punishment, and the cycle starts again.And, ironically, most of these healthy desserts just aren\u2019t all that healthy. For all the protein it packs, SoulFuel also provides nearly a quarter of your recommended daily sugar intake (a fact that the packaging attempts to elide by setting its serving size at half a cookie). HaloTop allows you to eat a high volume of ice cream without consuming a huge number of calories, but that doesn\u2019t make it particularly nutritious\u2014which is notable because increasingly, it seems that quality of calories matters much more than their quantity. And either way, you\u2019re still eating a several hundred calories\u2019 worth of not-very-good ice cream every day.It\u2019s heartening that we\u2019ve started moving away from this idea that grueling workouts, steamed vegetables, and strict abstemiousness are the only avenues to health, but, in the process, we\u2019ve moved to the opposite pole. We pretend that the process of pursuing health is one of constant pleasure and abundance: Ben and Jerry\u2019s new low-cal ice cream line is called Moo-phoria, which is both a corny pun and a suggestion of intense, ecstatic happiness. High-protein ice cream line Enlightened explicitly equates physical health with spiritual attainment.Perhaps it makes sense, then, that Tosi made her name on treats that conjured nostalgia for childhood sugar binges, birthday cake truffles in all of their rainbow sprinkled glory, as well as that she\u2019s turning to turmeric now. What we desire from her desserts is the same whether they\u2019re healthy or not: We long for something that will short-circuit us to ease, and make sweetness taste simple again.It\u2019s a powerful fantasy, and that\u2019s part of why desserts like these sell so well. They represent a relationship to food that is uncomplicated and un-conflicted, optimized simultaneously for health and for pleasure.  We feel guilty about what we eat, and these products promise to erase that feeling for once and for all, to tame our desires: those inconvenient reminders of our untameable animal selves. But every pint of ice cream has a bottom, and every time we reach it, we have to ask: Was that satisfying? Did I get what I truly wanted?Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishCookieChristina TosiMomofuku Milk BarTrendsRead MorecookingBreakfast Cookies Are the Reason We're Getting Up In the MorningBy Chris MoroccoRecipes you want to make.
