We\u2019re here to say\u2014let\u2019s all take a breath. \u201cThe perfect cup of coffee is the one you enjoy,\u201d says Areli Barrera de Grodski, co-owner of Little Waves Coffee Roasters and Cocoa Cinnamon coffee shop in Durham, North Carolina. We could pit the French press against the pour-over and debate which method is better all day, but the truth is, most baristas agree that you can brew great coffee with any method and any tools you have on hand. Whether you love the ritual of making your cup manually or you adore your automatic coffee maker, there\u2019s no wrong method\u2014but each has its pluses and minuses. We spoke to Barrera de Grodski and other coffee experts about their favorite ways to make coffee at home and how to improve your morning cup of joe, regardless of how you like to brew it.Drip Coffee MakerIf your household drinks a lot of coffee or you just want something that\u2019s convenient and essentially foolproof, Barrera de Grodski believes that a solid batch brewer (a.k.a. drip machine) is the way to go. \u201cI love the idea of pressing a button and making good coffee that\u2019s well-balanced, slightly sweet, and so good that it doesn\u2019t need milk or sugar,\u201d she says. \u201cI can easily achieve that with my batch coffee maker.\u201d The flavor of your cup, she explains, will depend on the water you\u2019re using, the ratio of grounds to water, and, of course, the type of coffee itself. For better coffee, start with freshly roasted beans and filtered water and use a scale to measure a coffee-to-water ratio of 1-to-16, or 16 grams of water for every gram of coffee. Note: This is a great starting ratio, but you can (and should!) adjust according to your preference.When it comes to making coffee at home, Sarah Elisabeth Huggins, co-owner of Daughter in Brooklyn, New York, is also on team automatic coffee machine: \u201cI love my Moccamaster, and have no shame in filling it with Caf\u00e9 Bustelo.\u201d Baristas also recommend the Bonavita 8-cup Coffee Maker, which Barrera de Grodski likes specifically for its showerhead dripper, which evenly disperses the water onto a flat bed of coffee and allows for an even extraction.Bonavita 8 Cup Coffee Maker$150 at Bed Bath & Beyond$289 at AmazonTechnivorm Moccamaster 10-Cup Coffee Maker$319 at Food52$340 at AmazonThe French PressIf you\u2019re into rich, full-bodied coffee, then the French press is for you. This method brews by soaking ground coffee directly in hot water\u2014sans filter\u2014rather than letting water pass through the grounds. Aki Yaguchi, head barista at Migrant Coffee in Melbourne, Australia, likes this method for its robust flavor: \u201cSince the water sits in contact with the coffee for longer without a filter, the results are more well-rounded with bolder, richer flavor,\u201d she says, \u201cIt\u2019s creamier and less watery.\u201dHere\u2019s how it works: Pour the grounds into the carafe, fill it with hot water, and stir it to make sure all of the coffee is properly saturated. Wait four minutes, put the lid on, and slowly depress the plunger to isolate all of the grounds at the bottom of the carafe.For the best results, use a coarser grind (Yaguchi loves her Porlex Mini Stainless-Steel Coffee Grinder) and make sure your water isn\u2019t too hot. These factors play a big role in brewing coffee that isn\u2019t under- or over-extracted. \u201cI think there\u2019s this misconception that coffee has to be at boiling point, but you want it to be at roughly 194\u00b0F to properly extract the flavors and not burn the coffee.\u201d If you\u2019ve heated your water to a boil, let it sit for a minute to cool down before brewing. And once the coffee has finished brewing, decant it into a mug as soon as possible instead of letting it sit in the French press so it doesn\u2019t become over-extracted.Bodum Chambord French Press$40 at Target$40 at AmazonThe Pour-OverIf you want a delicate, lighter-bodied coffee that gives you (almost) complete control over the flavor of your cup, then you\u2019ll appreciate a classic pour-over coffee. It\u2019s made by placing a simple filter cone over a coffee cup or carafe, filling that filter with ground coffee, and then pouring hot water over it and letting it drip through. It\u2019s a favorite among baristas, and it\u2019s the method Huggins turns to when she wants to delicately extract all of the coffee\u2019s tasting notes. \u201cWith a pour-over, you have the paper filter that removes some of the heavy oils. You have control over the speed of the pour and how many rounds of pouring there are,\u201d says Huggins. \u201cI like having that level of control.\u201dWith pour-overs, it\u2019s even more important to make sure you\u2019ve got the right grind size, water temperature, and coffee-to-water ratio. Baristas recommend using a burr grinder (manual or electric) and a gooseneck kettle for better precision. \u201cThe grind size will determine the brew time,\u201d says co-owner of Daughter Brian Stoothoff, \u201cIf the coffee is taking too long to come down, the grind is too fine\u2014if the water is flowing too fast, it\u2019s too coarse.\u201d A brew time that\u2019s too fast will lead to coffee that tastes salty and sour, while a longer brew time that\u2019s too slow will lead to coffee that tastes bitter, ashy, and burnt. \u201cYou want to hit that sweet spot for balanced acidity, bitterness, and sweetness,\u201d says Stoothoff. \u201cShoot for between two and a half and four minutes.\u201d The method takes a little patience and practice, but once you\u2019ve got it down it becomes a no-brainer.Hario V60 Pour Over Coffee Starter Set$22 at AmazonKalita Ceramic Coffee Dripper$19 at AmazonChemex Coffeemaker$47 at Amazon$50 at Sur La TableThe AeropressThe Aeropress is a favorite for coffee lovers on the go. This compact brewing device acts in the same way that a syringe does, with a plunger forcing hot water and grounds through a filter and straight into your cup. Coffee brewed in an Aeropress boasts a super-quick brew time and is generally smooth with low acidity. Some people claim that the Aeropress turns out single-serve coffee that\u2019s as strong as espresso, since technically you\u2019re brewing it under pressure, but actually that isn\u2019t possible. No matter: It\u2019s compact and lightweight enough to bring just about anywhere you go. \u201cIt\u2019s a great device for beginner coffee makers who are brewing a single cup. It\u2019s so simple to use and easy to clean,\u201d says Huggins.Aeropress Coffee Maker$30 at Amazon$30 at Bed Bath & BeyondEspresso MachineIf you like extremely strong coffee and espresso-based drinks (and have extra counter space and the money to spend)\u2014then you may want to consider getting an espresso maker. In this brewing method, a small amount of hot water is forced under a large amount of pressure through finely-ground coffee beans, which results in a super concentrated coffee. The high pressure also speeds up the extraction and brewing process to between 20 to 30 seconds, so you have a shorter period to hit that flavor extraction \u201csweet spot.\u201d Of all the popular coffee brewing methods, espresso takes the crown for being the most finicky, so use a burr grinder and scale and familiarize yourself with your machine.\u201cWhen making an espresso, your grinder is your biggest point of control,\u201d says Huggins. \u201cWhen making espresso at the shop, I\u2019m constantly tweaking the grind dose and grind size.\u201d If your espresso doesn\u2019t taste good, those are the first two variables to play with.Gaggia Classic Pro Espresso Machine$449 at AmazonBreville Bambino Plus Espresso Machine$500 at Bed Bath & Beyond$598 at AmazonThe Moka potIf you want to make strong coffee but don\u2019t feel inclined to purchase an espresso machine, the Moka pot (a.k.a. stovetop percolator) is for you. Like with espresso, boiling water\u2014pressurized by steam\u2014is passed through ground coffee, and the result is rich, flavorful, and highly concentrated. When Yaguchi isn\u2019t using her French press, she\u2019s reaching for her Moka pot: \u201cIt does take a little more attention and practice, but using a Moka pot is a fun, somewhat whimsical experience.\u201dBialetti Moka Pot$40 at Target$40 at AmazonCold brewPrefer your coffee over ice? Cold brew is made by soaking coffee grounds in cold or room temperature water for 16 to 24 hours. It\u2019s a slow extraction method, and the result is a smooth, heavy-bodied coffee. You can use a large mason jar and a sieve, but Yaguchi loves the Toddy Cold Brew System, which creates a concentrate that\u2019s less acidic. All you have to do is fill the Toddy with coffee and water, refrigerate it overnight, and extract the concentrate the next day. When you\u2019re ready to drink, pour it over ice and dilute it with three parts water. \u201cIt makes a really delicious, strong cold brew,\u201d Yaguchi adds.You can also flash-brew iced coffee by making regular coffee or coffee concentrate, then pouring it over ice. Barrera de Grodski also recommends the Coldwave Beverage Chiller, which cools hot beverages to room temperature in minutes. \u201cEssentially, you create a regular brew and instantly make it cold without diluting it\u2014and you don\u2019t have to make a concentrate,\u201d she says.Toddy Cold Brew System$40 at AmazonColdwave Beverage Chiller$40 at AmazonWhile you\u2019re here, check out the rest of our Coffee Week recipes, product recommendations, and brewing techniques:This Reusable Coffee Filter Means I Never Worry About Running OutThe Coffee to Water Ratio That Makes a Perfect BrewThis Flash-Frozen Concentrate Is Revolutionizing the Way I Drink CoffeeYou Should Add Spices to Your Coffee GroundsExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingRecipes you want to make.
