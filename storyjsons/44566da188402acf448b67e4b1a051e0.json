Add the beans and their sauce and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring, and using the back of a wooden spoon to mash some of the beans until a chunky puree forms and the sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes.Setup a breading station. In one shallow bowl, whisk the eggs. In another, add the flour. In a third  shallow bowl, add the panko. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Coat the chicken in flour, tapping off excess. Then dip in eggs and coat with panko, patting to adhere.Heat \u00bc-inch oil in a large high sided heavy bottomed skillet, and add two of the cutlets. Fry the cutlets, turning halfway through until panko is golden and cutlets are cooked through, about 4 minutes. Remove to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet or paper-towel lined plate and sprinkle with salt. Repeat with remaining cutlets.Slice rolls open and slather the bottom buns with the warm mashed beans. Top the beans with the pickled jalapeno, the cooked chicken cutlets, queso fresco, tomatoes, and onions. Season with salt and pepper and top with cilantro. Arrange the avocado on the cut side of the top buns and close the sandwiches.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for the Bon App\u00e9titNewsletterSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyExplore Bon App\u00e9titBUSH'S\u00ae BeansSandwichMexicanChicken BreastBlack BeanQueso FrescoAvocadoMainNut-FreeLunchDinnerMore from Bon App\u00e9titRecipes6 Pro Chefs Reveal Their \"Secret Weapon\" Ingredients2022-03-02T17:00:00.000ZrecipePorcini Gnocchi With Butter Sauce2022-03-15T09:00:00.000ZrecipeWhiskey Sour2020-12-16T18:20:00.000ZBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
