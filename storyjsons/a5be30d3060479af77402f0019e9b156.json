(That would be Redzepi.) The city that Noma built is now a culinary mecca not only for gastronauts but also for young cooks from around the world who come here to work at forward-thinking restaurants before going off to open their own casual concepts around town. That means that some of the best tacos, ramen, cocktails, and croissants you\u2019ll ever have can be found in a city so beautiful, so bikeable, so lifestyle-enviable (especially during those long summer nights on the canals), you might consider staying for a few years too\u2014if only to score a last-minute cancellation table at the new Noma 2.0.  \u2014Christine Muhlke The Hit ListFacebookPinterestPhoto by Ditte IsagerSlurp Ramen JointObsessively, meticulously made ramen that\u2019s got people lining up in Indre ByFacebookPinterestPhoto by Ditte IsagerNomaThe next evolution of Ren\u00e9 Redzepi\u2019s destination restaurant in Refshale\u00f8enFacebookPinterestPhoto by Ditte IsagerSanchezMexican food by way of Scandinavia in VesterbroRestaurantsBarrA beer geek\u2019s fantasy in Christianshavn, with crisp wafflesApollo Bar & KantineLook at contemporary art, eat some stellar bread at this Indre By hot spotManfredsThe still boundary-pushing, still neighborhood-y restaurant in Outer N\u00f8rrebroB\u00e6stPizza perfected in Inner N\u00f8rrebroGasoline GrillDon\u2019t be fooled by the gas pumps\u2014this mini chain serves Copenhagen's greatest burgerAmassHidden in Refshale\u00f8en, an elaborate root-to-stem tasting menuAdmiralgade 26Make yourself at home, if home\u2019s got smoked duck hearts, at this styled-out Indre By spotRel\u00e6Live a little with the N\u00f8rrebro tasting-menu restaurant that\u2019s still making wavesBarabbaMake the most of your jet lag by staying up all night at this Indre By chefs\u2019 hauntRestaurant Pal\u00e6gadeHead to Indre By to eat all the open-face sandwiches (and herring)Restaurant Sch\u00f8nnemannGet the OG Copenhagen experience at this Indre By sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d destinationCaf\u00e9 Atelier SeptemberThe breezy Indre By caf\u00e9 that\u2019s turned avocado toast into an art form108Noma\u2019s more casual spin-off in Christianshavn, with kombucha-shellacked pastriesKaptajnA laid-back lakeside hangout, with skewered meat and lots of natural wineLa BanchinaGet real R&R in at this Amager Harbor vegetable-focused restaurant with a few surprisesBarsDen VandretteGet your L\u2019Anglore fix at this sunny Indre By wine barAncestraleIn Vesterbro, a cool little wine bar (and a relief to your wallet)Duck and CoverA Mad Men-esque temple to mixology in Vesterbro.VinskabetIndulge your inner wine geek at this breezy N\u00f8rrebro bar.BRUSHydrate, sort of, with 33 constantly changing taps from this N\u00f8rrebro suds stopHimmeriget10 beer taps, lots of Fernet, and cocktails that\u2019ll make everyone happy at this Frederiksberg barVed Stranden 10Get lost in natural wines at this living room-esque Indre By barCoffee & ShopsJuno the BakeryFuel up for those canalside bike rides with these outstanding \u00d8sterbro carbsThe Coffee CollectiveA pour-over (and upcycled coffee kombucha) is always in reach, thanks to this mini chainMirabellePlan a mini croissant- and yogurt-filled vacation at this caf\u00e9-like spot in N\u00f8rreboroDemocratic CoffeeOne more reason to love the library (or at least this Indre By one): buttery croissantsAndersen & MaillardForget all about Paris and its croissants at this spare N\u00f8rrebro bakeryFood Lover's HotelsHotel AlexandraTake home design tips from this midcentury City Hall Square hotelHotel SandersHygge it up at this cozy boutique hotel near Copenhagen\u2019s Royal TheatreNobis Hotel CopenhagenReally treat yourself at this luxe downtown district lodgingExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
