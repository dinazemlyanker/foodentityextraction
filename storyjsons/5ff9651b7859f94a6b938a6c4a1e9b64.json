Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t have access to freshly foraged porcinis, though: This recipe relies on easier-to-find dried mushrooms, which are ground into powder and mixed into the dough. For the best and lightest gnocchi, Secchi suggests using slightly older potatoes: \u201cThey have less moisture content, so you can add less flour and keep your gnocchi from getting gummy.\u201d Roasting the potatoes on a wire rack allows steam to escape from every side. To form the gnocchi, look no further than your flatware drawer. \u201cYou can use a gnocchi board,\u201d Secchi says, \u201cbut my nonna always used a fork.\u201dAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Poke holes all over potatoes with a fork and place on a wire rack set inside a large rimmed baking sheet. Roast potatoes until flesh is easily pierced with a fork, 45\u201360 minutes. Let sit until just cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.Step 2Peel potatoes and pass through a potato ricer (or use the bottom of a glass to push through a fine-mesh sieve). Place in a large bowl and let cool completely.Step 3Meanwhile, pulse dried mushrooms in a spice mill or a high-speed blender to a fine powder. Transfer to a medium bowl and add flour and \u00bc tsp. salt; whisk to combine.Step 4Add dry ingredients and egg to bowl with potatoes and fold together. Then, using your hands, form into a single mass. Turn out onto a work surface and knead until smooth.Step 5Cut dough into 6 portions. Working with 1 portion at a time and covering remaining portions with plastic wrap while you work, roll each portion into a rope about \u00bd\" wide. Cut into \u00bd\"-long pieces and roll each piece along fork to form ridges. Arrange gnocchi in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet (line with parchment paper if making ahead).Step 6Cook gnocchi in a large pot of boiling salted water until they float to the surface, about 3 minutes (4 minutes if cooking from frozen). Drain, reserving \u00bd cup cooking liquid.Step 7While the gnocchi is cooking, heat butter in a medium high-sided skillet over medium, stirring often, until it foams, then browns, 5\u20138 minutes. Add sage leaves and \u00bc cup reserved pasta cooking liquid, tilting the pan away from you to protect yourself from spattering. Once spattering has settled down, swirl liquid in pan, then add gnocchi and cook, tossing and adding remaining pasta cooking liquid a little at a time (you might not need all of it) until sauce is combined and creamy and pasta is well coated, about 1 minute.Step 8Divide pasta among shallow bowls and top with Parmesan.Do ahead: Gnocchi can be formed 3 days ahead. Tightly wrap baking sheet and freeze.How would you rate Porcini Gnocchi With Butter Sauce?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (1)Back to TopTriangleDelicious dish! I thought the gnocchi could have used more salt, and because the dough was so soft it took some effort to roll them into that classic gnocchi shape. Maybe I needed to bake the potatoes longer so they had less moisture? The brown butter and sage sauce was tasty though I had to add a squeeze of lemon juice and and umami (small splash of soy sauce) to round out the flavor. Without that it was a little flat. All in all a lovely upgrade from plain gnocchi, and a recipe I will make again!
