When water starts to steam, add 3 Tbsp. salt and cover pot with a lid (this will bring water to a boil faster).Step 2While you are waiting on the water, do a little prep. Remove 4 oz. guanciale from packaging and cut into about 1x\u00bc\" strips. Finely grate 2 oz. cheese and set aside one-quarter of cheese for later.Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 3Whisk 4 egg yolks and 2 whole eggs in a medium bowl until no streaks remain, then stir in remaining grated cheese. Add several cranks of pepper and set aside.Step 4Working next to pot, heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Add guanciale and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp around the edges, 7\u201310 minutes.Step 5Remove pot from heat. Using a wooden spoon, fish out guanciale and transfer to a small bowl.

Season with salt, if needed. Thin sauce with remaining \u00bd cup pasta cooking liquid, adding a tablespoonful at a time, until it's the consistency of heavy cream (you most likely won\u2019t use all of it).Step 10Mix in guanciale and divide pasta among bowls. Top with pepper and reserved cheese.How would you rate Simple Carbonara?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (95)Back to TopTriangleI\u2019ve been hesitant to make this since I thought I\u2019d scramble the eggs, but this recipe was easy to follow and came out perfectly. We needed to make something when we really needed to do a grocery run, and all we had for pasta in the pantry was campanelle, and it still came out great. I added in some frozen peas just because we had half a bag, and it was pretty tasty. Anonymous3/17/2022I followed the recipe and the result was absolutely perfect carbonara. Tasted better than some of the restaurants we\u2019ve eaten in. No cream! That is the key. Too many of the recipes turn it into Alfredo. This is the best!jkuhnMankato MN3/13/2022Too salty, will used less salt in the pasta water next time. PariSouth Florida 3/6/2022looks easy enough and fast.  Thx.  I'll try it this weekend.Peri KirosMelbourne, FL3/3/2022I will never make packaged bacon carbonara again! This is by far the best recipe I've tried and will never use another! Lori LynnWrentham, AB2/20/2022Does anyone know if 4 egg yolks and 2 whole eggs means 6 eggs total or just 4 eggs with 2 of them being whole. Sorry if that's confusing and thank you in advance!AnonymousBoulder, CO1/27/2022@Michelle. I've never seen anyone so riled up over the word 'noodles'. Lol \n\nRecipe is great btw. Added some lemon zest & juice for balance.AnonymousOttawa, Ontario1/27/2022Fantastic recipe.  1st time I have successfully done the eggs without cooking them.  I added the juice of one lemon for an extra layer of flavor. I added all of the pasta water and we used lightly toasted Ciabatta slices to sop us the extra sauce.  Ken RauAtlanta, Ga1/25/2022The amounts in the recipes don't make sense and don't correlate with the short clips. Step 7 asks you to put a full cup of pasta water in the dutch oven along with the 3 tablespoons of fat, yet it seems there is a lot less in the clip. \n\nStep 8 asks you to boil until the amount of water is halved, yet in the clip we see that the bottom is completely dry!\n\nI will try again, halving the amounts of water and I'm pretty sure I'll find success there.JF LQuebec, Canada1/3/2022Great, easy recipe. Definitely didn\u2019t use as much salt in the boiling water as they recommend. Turned out excellent. Added in cherry tomatoes at the end to add some color and goodness. Will be adding this to my list of go to Bon Appetit recipes. Richard StarkeyThe Tetons, Wydaho12/29/2021Quick and easy carbonara.  I don't understand why some people use cream in this dish.  If you follow the easy instructions you end up with a succulent dish that is pleasing to eat and share.MBGreenville, SC11/27/2021Sorry but this came out like pasta with cheesy scrambled eggs. I halved the recipe because the amounts in this recipe were just too big. I used bacon, cut back on the salt, electing to add some later a little at a time as the bacon has salt in it. I also used freshly grated parmesan, so no excuses with ingredients. It's missing something huge but I don't know what. I tried to salvage it with a pinch of garlic powder and a table spoon or two of heavy cream but it still ended up in the garbage.AnonymousToronto, Canada11/18/2021Great carbonara recipe. Using the dutch oven to finish cooking the pasta is a good way of making sure to get all the flavour into it. I didn't put as much salt as that into the pasta water though because that just seems crazy.JimbaliLondon, UK11/15/2021WAY TOO SALTY.  Using the pasta water made the dish too salty, my wife couldn\u2019t eat it.John CanfieldWilliamsburg, Virginia 10/28/2021Absolutely delicious, and so easy. The boyfriend was meeting the boys for dinner, I whipped this up for myself, but the boyfriend couldn\u2019t stop eating before he left for dinner with the boys! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 \nLoved it and will definitely make again.AnonymousChicago 9/25/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titPastaItalianEuropeanGuancialeCured MeatMeatPancettaBaconSpaghettiPasta & NoodlesRigatoniBucatiniEasyWeeknight MealsQuick5 Ingredients or FewerMainNut-FreeSaut\u00e9DinnerRecipes you want to make.
