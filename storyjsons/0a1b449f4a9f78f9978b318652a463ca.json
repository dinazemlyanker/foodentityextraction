E. BergerEmailPinterestPrintEmailPinterestPrint\u201cIt was my civic duty to come up with new cookie recipes,\u201d writes owner Lisa Ludwinski in the Sister Pie cookbook, \u201cand my dad\u2019s peanut butter cookie cravings had some influence on the direction I took. Knowing I\u2019d never make just any ol\u2019 peanut butter cookie, my dad teased me with a few ideas. Mission accepted. This cookie\u2019s soft, salty-sweet, chewy center is spiked with smoked paprika and topped with a big pinch of flaky sea salt, raw sugar, and even more smoked paprika. The Peanut Butter Paprika Cookie represents our style at its best: familiar yet new, comforting with a side of adventure.\u201dReprinted with permission from Sister Pie, copyright \u00a9 2018.

Slightly flatten each ball with your palm, then use a fork to create that classic peanut butter cookie design.Step 8Combine raw sugar, sea salt, and remaining 1 Tbsp. granulated sugar and 2\u00bd tsp. paprika in a small bowl. Top each round with about \u00bd tsp. paprika mixture.Step 9Bake cookies until edges are beginning to turn golden brown and tops no longer look wet, 16\u201318 minutes.

I made a quick batch of peanut butter with dry roasted and salted peanuts I had in the pantry. And I doubled the paprika as per reviewers suggestions. They were so unique. Rich and deep and sweet and salty. I dream about them! LaraNashville, TN1/14/2021Hi, I have a question. What kind of PB should I plan to use for this? the natural stir to enjoy kind or a jar of JIF?ChaseMN12/4/2020Not sure if this breaks a cardinal baking rule, but I only chilled for four hours.  Then rather than wait for the dough to soften before forming, I formed the little patties while it was still cold and firm.  A lot easier and less messy than trying to form without a proper scoop.  Cookies turned out great, in my opinion.  Very possible they could have been exponentially better if I followed the technique to the letter, but for those desperate for a quarantine cookie in less than 30 hours, I think you can get away with it.  AnonymousDC4/17/2020For quarantine/lockdown these unique, delicious cookies come as a sweet relief. They are the perfect balance of salty, sweet, warm, and smoky. All the things. I had to use what we had in the pantry and fridge. That meant white whole wheat instead of APF and bread flour instead of whole wheat. I also subbed crunchy peanut butter instead of smooth, and finely chopped palm sugar instead of raw. It worked! So delicious.AnonymousHerndon, VA3/29/2020Great recipe! I took them out a few min early and they were perfect!!! \n\nI would love to try them again!! I agree that you could push the paprika a bit further if you like. AnonymousRochester NY3/18/2020I switched this recipe up just a bit. I creamed the butter sugar and eggs together for 10-15 minutes than continued on with the recipe. This was a trick I learned to elevate my cookies and it worked perfectly in this recipe. I also added more paprika to the recipe. I would absolutely make this again but add more even more paprika to the recipe and skip the salt on top.AnonymousSan Francisco CA12/2/2018I just made these and they were fantastic!  My friend loves peanut butter cookies and she actually hid the bag of cookies from her husband so he wouldn't eat them all!  I followed the recipe exactly even chilling the dough for 24 hrs. and letting the dough sit for 2-3 hrs. before baking, which was the hardest part because we wanted the cookies NOW!!! :D  I used the kind of peanut butter that you make yourself from one of the machines in the grocery store that simply grinds the peanuts into peanut butter.  No sugar or anything else was added to the peanut butter, just peanuts.  This will be the go-to peanut butter cookie recipe from now on.  As a side note: my friends and I are going to trying to add chocolate chunks to the cookies since we like the chocolate/peanut butter combo.  Fingers crossed they come out delicious!AnonymousWildomar, California11/15/2018I was so excited to try (and taste) this recipe and made them as soon as I had a free weekend! They didn't turn out exactly as expected and I'm not sure what I did wrong. Both the flavor and texture seemed different than described in this article and the instagram stories the Bon Appetit team did about the recipe. The flavor was weaker than expected and the texture seemed \"powdery\" (can't think of a better word to describe it) rather than sticky like cookie dough usually is. They were very oily feeling, but when bitten into they crumbed very easily. I wonder if it's the peanut butter I used? Trader Joes brand \u2014 perhaps I should have gotten a classic like JIF? I will be trying this bad boy again cause the flavors just seem fabulous.AnonymousElkridge, MD11/6/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titCookieDessertPeanut ButterCondiments, Sauces & PastesPaprikaHerbs & SpicesBakingRecipes you want to make.
