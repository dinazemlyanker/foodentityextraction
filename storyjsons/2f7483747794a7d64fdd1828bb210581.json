I\u2019d satisfied my craving for the flavors of restaurant food, and, by Monday, all I wanted was to eat something that tasted like I made it. I would swing by the grocery store and grab ingredients, thrilled at the thought of cooking recipes I loved\u2014chicken lettuce wraps, lemony pasta, roast chicken\u2014but that I\u2019d slowly adjusted over time to fit my tastes. The joy was in the comfort, the ease, the ability to follow my tongue and find exactly what I wanted.The first few weeks of self-isolation, I made those meals I knew and loved for stability and sustenance. I made macaroni and cheese. I made sourdough bread sliced thickly and dunked into tomato basil soup. I made the stuff I thought would fill the gap growing inside of me that used to be filled with restaurants and seeing my friends and living in a world larger than three square blocks. My weekly menu of convenience and consistency might have brought me joy if it had been broken up by eating out, but when strung together back-to-back forever, it left me bored and distressed.There\u2019s a lot I miss about restaurants\u2014being in a room full of people, the good lighting, the server at the place where I\u2019m a regular pouring wine without asking because they want me to try it\u2014but what I miss most is being surprised. I miss the joy of taking a bite and looking at the person I\u2019m with, both of our eyes wide as if to say, \u201cCan you believe it tastes like this?\u201dI\u2019d never really learned how to be creative in the kitchen because I\u2019d never needed to be. And, now, I didn\u2019t know where to start. But if I was going to survive an unknown number of weeks without restaurants, I was going to have to figure it out.I first turned to Deb Perelman, cookbook author and creator of the blog Smitten Kitchen, who told me that often, people who cook a lot have a staple flavor palate they reach for without thinking. It\u2019s what your personal tongue likes best. \u201cI remember having this conversation with my mom when I was a kid,\u201d she says, \u201cwhere I was upset because no one\u2019s peanut butter and jelly tasted as good as hers to me, and she told me \u2018I\u2019m the one who sets your peanut butter and jelly for you.\u2019\u201dThe first step of making your food taste different and new to you is figuring out what your base palate is. Perelman tells me to think of something simple like avocado toast. For her, she says she would season it with lemon, olive oil, pepper, and salt. When I thought about my own palate, I also would use lemon and salt, but would sub in an aioli, some cumin, and red pepper flakes. Those are the flavors of my palate. I realized that every recipe I adapted, every recipe I made, I was dressing the same way. I was hitting them all with a burst of lemon, a little parm, red pepper flakes. What had made me crave my own food before made me sick of it now that I was cooking three meals a day.But knowing that I had a signature was just an acknowledgement of the problem. To move beyond acceptance and onto action, I talked to Perelmen and chefs at some great restaurants across the country and found four cooking strategies to challenge my palate. .1. Follow a recipe to a TPerelman recommended following a recipe exactly\u2014and preferably one that intimidates you. \u201cUsually we cook on autopilot and do the things we know how to do, but if you follow a recipe absolutely exactly, you won\u2019t make those natural subs that fit your palate,\u201d Perelman says. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to have to follow an Ottolenghi recipe, or one from whatever restaurant you miss the cooking from. There\u2019s going to be a recipe with three cups of herbs. Suspend your disbelief and try it.\u201d Trying something from a cuisine you don\u2019t usually make yourself or from a chef you don\u2019t know well can help broaden the range of flavors you\u2019re using.2. Mix up your methodsUsing a recipe exactly, though, only works if you have all of the ingredients, which may not happen depending on when you last made a grocery trip. That doesn\u2019t mean that all hope for an exciting dinner is lost. Once you know what your natural tendencies are, thinking about how to sub those out becomes simpler. If your fat of choice is olive oil, try butter or coconut oil or ghee. If your typical acid is lemon, try lime or grapefruit or vinegar. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to be purists in this day and age,\u201d says Jocelyn Law-Yone, chef and co-owner of Thamee and Toi Moi in Washington, D.C. \u201cIf you can\u2019t find something or don\u2019t have it, who cares. Put whatever you have in! \u201d\u201cI totally get why you\u2019re bored with your own stuff,\u201d Dan Jacobs, the chef and owner of DanDan in Milwaukee, WI, says. \u201cI\u2019ve been cooking professionally for 22 years. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever cooked at home as much as I have in the last four weeks, ever.\u201d\u201cEven if you\u2019re just going to make a roast chicken,\u201d Jacobs says, \u201ctry using ginger and soy, just try something else even if you aren\u2019t sure it will work.\u201d Most people have something in their pantry that they haven\u2019t used often. Maybe horseradish is hiding in your refrigerator, or a jar of olives in your bar cart. (I found both in my small apartment.)Kim Alter, chef and owner of Nightbird in San Francisco, suggests mixing up how you prepare ingredients as well. If you always saut\u00e9 onions, for example, confit or pickle them. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard right now because you have to deal with what you have in your pantry,\u201d Alter says, \u201cbut can you change up the way you handle them?\u201d3. Find some friendly competitionLaw-Yone says that she has become a kind of dinner hotline for the former staff members of Thamee. They text in a group about what they\u2019re making or what they need help with. What can I do with this ingredient? How can I cook this in a new way?We don\u2019t all have a Jocelyn to help us, but one thing she says she\u2019s seen in the group text is a form of friendly competition. Even the staff members who didn\u2019t cook or mainly baked have begun trying to plate their dishes and make more complicated things to show off in the group. \u201cBeing envious of what your friend made,\u201d she says, \u201cis a great way to inspire you and make you ask, \u2018hey, how did you make that sauce?\u201d4. Play a mini Chopped with yourselfThe real time to mix up your kitchen life, though, is when you make your rare grocery store visit.\u201cMost people when they go shopping grab all the same things,\u201d Alter says. \u201cIf I were at Whole Foods, I\u2019d grab some kind of fermented chili or chili oil.\u201d So push yourself to grab something you\u2019ve never bought before and then put it right next to your cutting board so you have to use it.Researching recipes with that ingredient will lead you to new places. And while it always feels risky to buy something you\u2019re not sure you\u2019ll use\u2014and, with fewer and fewer opportunities to buy groceries, now more than ever\u2014it can also be a great way to pressure yourself out of a rut. Buy a spice that you don\u2019t use regularly, and buy it without a plan. Be brave, Law-Yone says, and grab a whole fish. Grab a mango or a pomegranate or a big daikon radish.Since I figured out my go-to flavors, I\u2019ve been trying my best to avoid them. I dug a jar of coconut oil out of the back of my pantry and used it in several dishes this week. I found caraway seeds and cardamom pods I bought for a specific recipe and never used again and tossed them in dishes. I gave myself license to play and to fail. I cooked an Ottolenghi salad without cheating at all\u2014it used 2 whole cups of mint and tasted incredible. I picked a friend who continues to churn out absolutely beautiful plates of food on Instagram to be my new rival, and when I told him, he agreed to be in a battle to spur creativity. I immediately started brainstorming my weekend cooking plans.A couple of days ago, I was tired and stressed and frustrated. I returned to the chicken larb recipe I had adjusted with all of my favorite flavors, and I tried to tweak them just enough. I used coconut oil and gojuchang. I used pickled spring onions instead of red onions. I added eggplant. When it was done, I took one bite and was stunned. To my astonishment\u2014and relief\u2014it didn\u2019t taste like anything I\u2019d ever cooked before. I opened my eyes wide and said, to myself, \u201cCan you believe it tastes like this?\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyish Guide to Being AloneHealthyishRecipes you want to make.
