Turned out I was wrong.By Alex DelanyApril 26, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailI am not vegan. I am a human being that eats so much meat. And cheese. I love cheese on meat and meat on cheese. I also love dairy-based dips, and if you told me I was going to love something called \u201cvegan cashew cream,\u201d I\u2019d call you a dirty liar. Cashews are great. And I generally enjoy creamy stuff. But when you throw the V word in there...I don\u2019t know. My excitement fades. But guess what. Joke\u2019s on me, because it\u2019s actually messed up how much I like this new Put-It-On-Everything Cashew Sauce. WHAT IS HAPPENING? WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT? WHAT AM I BECOMING? VEGAN STUFF! AND ME! LOOKING LIKE WE LOVE EACH OTHER! A MIRACLE.There are three things that make this stuff amazing. If you\u2019re the kind of person who likes when things are explained in numbered, easily digestible lists, today is a great day for you. If you\u2019re not that kind of person, too bad. I\u2019m still going to do that. The merits of this sauce are as follows:1. It\u2019s Easier Than Something That\u2019s Super EasyYeah. It\u2019s that easy. Easier than tying your shoes. Easier than holding the door open for someone. (Be nice! Do it!) And definitely easier than paying off your credit card. Vegan cashew cream only uses four ingredients, and takes about five minutes to make (plus 10 minutes of letting nuts soak).First, you let the cashews soak in some boiling water for about 10 minutes. You then take the strained cashews and dump them in a blender with some kosher salt, tender herbs (cilantro, basil, parsley, and chives all work), rice or white vinegar, and a bit of the water that you soaked those cashews in. And then...yeah, you guessed it. You hit the button that turns on the blender and watch the contents turn into a green spread-ish thing. The texture is perfect: dip-able, spreadable, and scoop-able. Not too firm and not too runny. If you\u2019re thinking, \u201cI don\u2019t know. That sounds pretty difficult.\u201d I\u2019d like to invite you over for a chat about what \u201cdifficult\u201d actually means.You could definitely swap in some herby cashew cream for the miso dressing under those sweet potatoes.\n2. It Can Play Any PositionYes, that subhead was a sports reference! Doesn\u2019t even matter what sport! The reference is versatile, just like this cashew cream! You can use this stuff for just about anything. I wouldn\u2019t put it in my coffee, but the other options are limitless. You can use it as a dip for pita or focaccia or crudites. You can use it as a dressing for an endive or kale salad. You can schmear it on toast. You can plate roasted vegetables on top of it. You can even drizzle a little of it over some roasted chicken, and that stuff will tasty really damn good. I honestly don\u2019t even know what to really call this stuff. It is everything\u2014sauce, dip, dressing, spread, and cream\u2014simultaneously. It does it all.Whoa, a picture of meat in a vegan article? Whatever, the cream tastes good on roast chicken. Deal with it.\n3. It Tastes Like Something That\u2019s Not VeganThis vegan dip tastes...good. Really good. I\u2019m not a vegan food-hater, but I am a vegan food-skeptic. I always feel like I\u2019m missing out on a better experience when someone tells me to try something that\u2019s vegan. I would like to go on record in saying that I do not feel like I am missing out on anything when I eat this cashew cream.Soaking those cashews before blending them softens them, giving you a dip that isn\u2019t chalky and pasty, but creamy and pleasantly nutty. It tastes like there\u2019s dairy in there. And the herbs and vinegar brighten the whole thing up, rolling waves of leafy, vegetal flavor and acid over whatever the cream ends up on. It tastes like, well, like maybe I wouldn\u2019t be missing anything by going vegan. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever find out for sure though. Because right now I\u2019m thinking about spreading vegan cashew cream all over a ham and cheese sandwich.Get. The.
