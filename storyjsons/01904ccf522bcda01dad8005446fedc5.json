My family, the Khans, formerly of Dhaka, Bangladesh, now of Dallas, Texas, are finally beginning to settle in our adopted homeland. After a few rocky years in the States, my parents have steady-ish jobs, an apartment where the lights come on, and a neurotic 8-year-old (me) who no longer weeps in school every day, my angst already threatening to bloom at a tender young age. When the mood strikes, when there\u2019s joie de vivre in our hearts, we even go out to eat. The restaurant? It\u2019s always, always a Chinese buffet.And it\u2019s always on a Saturday morning when my family makes the pilgrimage to our favorite all-you-can-eat establishment tucked into a strip mall off of Northwest Highway. We follow a certain set of rituals: The night before, my dad imposes a half-joking, half-serious fast, encouraging light portions. He has a banana for dinner; my mom rolls her eyes but acquiesces. If we arrive at exactly 11 a.m., right when the restaurant opens, we\u2019re greeted by rows and rows of fresh, heaping platters of all the American Chinese classics: mounds of fiery red General Tso\u2019s chicken, piles of slick lo mein, deep vats of beef-and-broccoli, and some sort of crab-and-cheese casserole. We walk past stately plastic bamboo plants and regal dioramas of waterfalls and pagodas. Inexplicably, we also see trays of pizza and french fries and chicken wings, although they look a little too much like freezer food to be all that appetizing.For the indecently low price of $4.95 a person, we heap grotesque piles on our plates, the garlic sauce from the chicken oozing onto the sweet and sour eggplant spilling into the noodles, the whole construction haphazardly sprinkled with fried wontons and spring rolls. At the Chinese buffet, I am a child sovereign with total freedom to do with my dominion as I wish. Occasionally, my dad cries out, \u201cThat\u2019s enough! Enough!\u201d when I wield the serving spoon too indiscriminately. This rings hollow because, of course, he will finish what I cannot. My favorite part is the maniacal power I feel while operating the soft-serve machine, swirling crooked lines of chocolate and vanilla ice cream into a crystal bowl.For me, the best part of going to the buffet was always that, when you did it correctly, you felt as if you were getting away with something.\u00a0My family loved Chinese buffets so much that, as we grew more comfortable living in the U.S. and started taking road trips, we ate at buffets in every state we happened to be driving through at lunchtime, in Oklahoma and Arkansas, in Illinois and Maryland, in Utah. (At 15 years old, I had to draw the line when, on our first European vacation, my parents attempted to drag me to a Chinese buffet in Paris.) Today, however, the heyday of the Chinese buffet seems to be long past. While some still exist throughout the country, all the ones we used to go to in my hometown\u2014the China Gardens, the Super Buffets, the King Woks\u2014have closed. I\u2019m deeply nostalgic for that feeling of waking up on a Saturday morning knowing I would spend the next few hours gorging myself at the Chinese buffet.I\u2019m not the only avid buffet enthusiast. David R. Chan, an archivist of Chinese dining who lives in Los Angeles and has eaten at nearly 8,000 restaurants over the past several decades, said although some might sneer at the quality of the food, he\u2019s always been a sucker for a good Chinese buffet. He first visited one in the late 1970s, when a buffet chain called the Viking\u2019s Table began offering Chinese cuisine at one of its branches. Over the years, he\u2019s patronized them all over the West Coast for delicious, satisfying meals at bargain prices. \u201cI love a deal, so that\u2019s part of the attraction,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cSo is the fact of being able to find a dish that you really like and eat to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d But many of Chan\u2019s favorite buffets have since closed too.For such a beloved institution, Chinese buffets seem to be a fairly recent phenomenon. In 1949, Chang\u2019s Restaurant advertised itself in The Los Angeles Evening Citizen News as a Chinese buffet, claiming to be the \u201cfirst served in the U.S.\u201d with \u201cover 20 delicious selections.\u201d Chan said Chinese buffets likely drew inspiration from the Scandinavian smorgasbord-style restaurants that started popping up in Las Vegas casinos after World War II and spreading across the country as word of their success grew.The buffets really began proliferating in the 1990s, according to Jennifer 8. Lee, a journalist and the author of The Fortune Cookie Chronicles. She said their numbers were propelled by the arrival of Fujianese immigrants who came to the U.S. and took over restaurants from Cantonese proprietors. They quickly discovered the benefits of the buffet business model: The quantity of food cost more and resulted in more waste, but the self-serve model meant cheaper labor costs and hardly any need for the staff to speak English.\u201cAt a certain point, it\u2019s sort of what everyone expected,\u201d Lee said of the buffets becoming mainstays across the country. \u201cIn the Midwest, \u2018No. 1 Chinese Buffet\u2019 became the standard thing in small towns.\u201d Lee, who crisscrossed 42 states and patronized dozens of Chinese restaurants to research her book, also had a particular fondness for Chinese buffets, with a big selling point being the chance to try a lot of different dishes. \u201cI loved the Chinese buffets. I thought they were amazing,\u201d she said. \u201cYou had noodles, you had rice, it\u2019s relatively cheap per pound, and you could have all the things. They had variety.\u201dIn recent years the buffet format has struggled to continue to lure diners, with large national chains such as Sweet Tomatoes and Old Country Buffet closing. The pandemic may have hastened their demise over concerns about the safety of sharing serving utensils and crowding next to other diners in line.But Chinese buffets have faced unique changes. Even before the pandemic, the New York Times found in 2019 that more than 1,000 Chinese restaurants, not limited to buffets, had closed in major metropolitan years in the five years prior. Some owners told the Times that their sons and daughters were pursuing professional careers, and they were glad that their children didn\u2019t have to take on the grueling work of running a restaurant, with its long hours and slim margins. Chinese restaurants supported immigrant families trying to make a livelihood. But, Lee says, as future generations grew wealthier, they no longer relied on the restaurants as much.The reign of the Chinese buffet may be coming to an end, but I\u2019m grateful that they were able to give my family a little taste of luxury when they, too, were new immigrants trying to build a life. For me, the best part of going to the buffet was always that, when you did it correctly, you felt as if you were getting away with something. We weren\u2019t getting away with much back then: My parents were preoccupied with paying the bills; I was just hoping to survive second grade. So this was as close to abundance as we would get. We were taking our joy where we could find it, and for a while, we found it within an enormous tray of chicken fried rice.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCultureLifestyleRecipes you want to make.
