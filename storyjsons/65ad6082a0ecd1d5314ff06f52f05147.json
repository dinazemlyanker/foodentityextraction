The cookies have just the right balance of crispy edges, soft middles, and big chocolate flavor, with the prettiest shade of red in the land and crunchy sparkle from sanding sugar. In addition to requiring no special equipment, you won\u2019t need to refrigerate this cookie dough or let it rest before baking, making it perfect for when you need a cookie right away. Gel food coloring works best to achieve the deep red color\u2014plus, it won\u2019t affect the texture of the final cookies the way liquid food coloring does (if the dough is too wet, the cookies will spread upon baking, resulting in less chewy cookies with crackle-less tops\u2014a tragedy on both fronts). And while any brand of sanding sugar is fine, we\u2019ve found that the Betty Crocker brand delivers the most vibrant, sparkly finish (you\u2019ll definitely end up with red-stained fingers no matter which sugar you use, but that\u2019s a sacrifice we\u2019re willing to make). \u2014Jessie SheehanAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Morton kosher salt2tsp. red gel food coloring2cups (250 g) all-purpose flour\u00bdcup red sanding sugar (preferably Betty Crocker; about 2 oz.)PreparationStep 1Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0. Vigorously whisk 1\u00bd cups (packed; 300 g) light brown sugar and 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted, slightly cooled, in a large bowl until lightened in color and smooth and glossy, about 30 seconds. Whisk in 2 chilled large egg yolks and 1\u00bd tsp. vanilla extract. Adding one at a time and whisking after each addition, sprinkle in \u2154 cup (54 g) unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder, 1 tsp. baking soda, and 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt. Whisk in 2 tsp. red gel food coloring, then add 2 cups (250 g) all-purpose flour and fold in with a rubber spatula just until the last streak of flour disappears (be careful not to overmix).Step 2Pour \u00bd cup red sanding sugar (preferably Betty Crocker; about 2 oz.) into a small shallow bowl. Divide dough into 16 equal portions (about 3 Tbsp. or 55 g each) and roll each portion into a ball. Roll each ball in sanding sugar to evenly coat, then divide between 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 2\" apart.Step 3Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and front to back after 6 minutes, until puffed up and tops begin to crack, 12\u201314 minutes. Let cookies cool on baking sheets 5 minutes (they will collapse as they cool), then transfer to wire racks and let cool completely.Do ahead: Cookies can be baked 3 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature, or freeze in a resealable plastic bag for up to 1 month.How would you rate Sparkly Red Velvet Cookies?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkExplore Bon App\u00e9titCookieDessertSnackNut-FreeEasyBakingCocoaOther IngredientsRecipes you want to make.
