While French chef Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame is recognized as the first to identify four sauces as the foundation of culinary basics, it was French chef Auguste Escoffier who added hollandaise, to what became known as the \u201cfive mother sauces\u201d when he published them in recipe form in his Le Guide Culinaire in 1903.It\u2019s no surprise that some of the world\u2019s top chefs, like Thomas Keller, Hugh Acheson, and Paul Kahan all use sturdy, reliable All-Clad pots and pans in the kitchen. The brand's reputation for even heating, durability, and craftsmanship make them an obvious choice, especially when a delicate roux is at hand. With gorgeous All-Clad sauce pans and sauciers at the ready, learn how to make the five most essential sauces in the culinary game, and impress all your friends at your next dinner party.HollandaiseThis creamy yellow sauce appears to be quite simple\u2013its only ingredients are egg yolks, lemon juice, water, salt, and butter. In reality, however, it's a process to master, as the key lies in the timing and the whisking. If it was up to Thomas Keller (take it away, Tom!), he\u2019d prefer to make his hollandaise straight out of a saucier. We recommend the c4 Copper 2.5 Quart Saucier. The eggs can be whisked into a condensed surface area, allowing for a nice emulsion. Once you\u2019ve perfected your hollandaise, serve it with everything from eggs to asparagus to artichokes.EspagnoleThis brown sauce is often paired with meat dishes like roast lamb or as the base of a beef bourguignon. A rich, flavorful espagnole starts with browned mirepoix (carrots, celery, and onions), brown beef or veal stock, and fond (deglazed brown bits) from beef bones. From there, tomato pur\u00e9e or paste is added, and the whole sauce is thickened with a dark brown roux. A sturdy 3-quart pan like the c4 Copper 3-Quart Sauce Pan is optimal for consistent, even heating.B\u00e9chamelWhile all the mother sauces have a distinct decadence about them, b\u00e9chamel may very well be the most mouthwatering of the group. You know it as the sauce that takes your macaroni up a notch, or as the secret weapon in your latest lasagna. And like the other four, this creamy white sauce has basic ingredients: butter, flour, milk, salt, and pepper (though we add Parmesan, cayenne pepper, and nutmeg to ours for a flavorful twist). Craft the sauce in a medium to large saucepan, like the 2-Quart Stainless Saucier which with its wide mouth and curved sides, allow for good mobility while whisking and adding ingredients.Velout\u00e9While velout\u00e9 is a flavorful sauce in its own right, often served over poached or steamed fish or chicken, it's also often used as a building block to gravies and other mixtures like bisque or pot pie. It starts with a white roux, and is then mixed with a light stock from fish, chicken, or veal, making it an easy addition to rich-in-flavor recipes. Use the c4 Copper 2-Quart Sauce Pan to make a large batch and keep on hand, so the next time you need to whip up a comfy, cozy chicken pot pie, you\u2019ve already done half the work.Sauce TomateYou don\u2019t have to stroll the aisle at your local grocery store to know that there are about a million iterations of tomato sauce. Traditionally, however, tomatoes would be simmered with onions and garlic, and cooked down until thickened to one\u2019s liking, or with a roux. The classic French version, sauce tomate, is also flavored with pork and aromatic vegetables. Because of its versatility, we say skip the small saucepan and whip up a big batch with the Stainless 5.5-Qt Dutch Oven. You can freeze what you don\u2019t immediately eat\u2014and voila!
