Read all the stories here.You\u2019re hosting a dinner party, and you are ready. The dining table is set. Your linen napkins complement your tortoiseshell Sabre flatware perfectly. Your new stackable wine glasses have banished those permanently smudged old mason jars from the table. You bought flowers, and they are not carnations. The only problem? You don\u2019t have enough plates to go around. Maybe no one will notice that you\u2019re eating roast chicken from a bowl?Maybe it\u2019s time to upgrade your tableware. I\u2019m not saying you should go out and purchase a 96-piece dinnerware set (Does anyone need 12 teacups? What even is a \u201cfruit saucer?\u201d), but matching dinner plates, salad or dessert plates, and shallow bowls do go a long way toward making your table setting feel cohesive. Below, you\u2019ll find our favorite ceramic dinnerware sets\u2014the ones we use at home, secretly want to pilfer from the BA Test Kitchen, and spend hours gawking at on Instagram. Many are hand-thrown on a wheel by an actual person, and all are not only dishwasher- and microwave-safe but will also make your dinner party guests marvel at your togetherness\u2014even if you overcooked the chicken.East ForkBack when desks and office lunches were a thing, we all coveted senior food editor Christina Chaey\u2019s perfect East Fork Everyday Bowl, which she kept on hand for grainy salads and brothy noodles. You can purchase it solo or save 10% and snag the whole 5-piece Shallow Dinner Set, which also includes a breakfast bowl, a dinner plate, a side plate, and a cake plate. May I recommend the very \u201970s Harvest Moon colorway?We also love the dedication East Fork shows to giving back to its community: Each quarter it fundraises for a different North Carolina\u2013based nonprofit, organization, or individual. Send East Fork a screenshot of your donation receipt, and it\u2019ll grant you access to its seconds site, where you can find slightly imperfect pieces at 20% off retail.The Everyday Bowl$40 at East Fork5-Piece Shallow Dinner Set$162 $146 at East ForkOur PlaceHere you\u2019ll find dinner plates, side plates, and bowls in chic neutral hues that you can, of course, color coordinate with your Always Pan and/or nails. They\u2019re made of porcelain, an especially durable type of ceramic that is fired at high temperatures, and the gloss finish over a matte base creates a sleek two-tone effect. The plates feature a little lip so your saucy spiced cod with corn does not runneth over, and the bowls are cylindrical and stackable.Main Plates (4-Pack)$50 at Our PlaceSide Plates (4-Pack)$40 at Our PlaceSide Bowls (4-Pack)$45 at Our PlaceJono PandolfiCeramist-to-the-culinary stars Jono Pandolfi crafts pieces for restaurants like Jean-Georges and Missy Robbins\u2019 Lilia, and test kitchen director Chris Morocco credits the \u201cPandolfi magic\u201d with transforming even his most half-assed lunches into something Instagram-worthy. Chris favors the Coupe Place Setting, which comes with an entr\u00e9e plate, a salad plate, a cereal bowl, and the fan favorite Alaska bowl, which was originally designed for Eleven Madison Park\u2019s dessert course.Coupe 4-Piece Place Setting$150 at Jono Pandolfi8.5\" Coupe Alaska Bowl$48 at Jono PandolfiFelt + FatThese minimalist porcelain plates and bowls put the attention right where it should be: on your beef Wellington that came out a little weird lookin\u2019 but still tasted great. We carry Felt + Fat\u2019s dinner plates, salad plates, and soup bowls in the Bon App\u00e9tit Market, as well as this petite planter that looks like a vanilla birthday cake covered in monochrome Nerds. The Pigeon colorway features a semimatte satin finish, but if slight silverware marks drive you nuts, get the glossy Milk glaze instead.Felt+Fat Dinner Plate$55 at Bon App\u00e9tit MarketFelt+Fat Soup Bowl$36 at Bon App\u00e9tit MarketSoil BakerYou can pluck gim bugak off Hye Rin Yang\u2019s bowls and dishes at Atoboy in New York, or you can grab your own set from her exclusive collaboration with DTC cookware company Material. I\u2019m especially fond of the shallow Open Bowl in Grotto, a dramatic dark glaze that shimmers like the night sky. Complete your dinner set with a full plate, half plate, and round bowl. Material x Soil Baker\u2019s ceramics are lighter and more delicate than, say, East Fork\u2019s or Heath\u2019s heftier pieces, but they\u2019re still durable enough for everyday use.The Open Bowl (2-Pack)$80 at Material KitchenThe Half Plate (2-Pack)$60 at Material KitchenHaandHaand\u2019s porcelain dinnerware sets are a little swervier than some of the options on this list\u2014the edges of its dessert plates and salad bowls are quirkily uneven with glazes in colors like sea-foam green and mottled copper. I have a couple of Haand\u2019s large serving platters (bought during one of its very good seconds sales) which, when not holding a whole fish, double as a tray for candles and other tabletop paraphernalia. Its 3-Piece Ripple Dinner Setting comes with a dinner plate, a salad plate, and a pasta bowl. Otherwise, put on your big-boy pants and spring for the 5-Piece Skali Coupe Dinner Setting, which includes three different sizes of coupes\u2014which are kind of bowl-like plates\u2014a breakfast bowl, and a Chemist Cup perfect for a midafternoon pistachio snack.3-Piece Ripple Dinner Setting$114 $95 at Haand5-Piece Skali Coupe Dinner Setting$163.50 $135 at HaandHeathHeath is a classy broad and always will be. Edith Heath launched her best-selling Coupe ceramic dinnerware in 1948, and it arguably (by me, I am arguing this) cannot be improved upon. You\u2019ll find Heath\u2019s dish sets at restaurants like Chez Panisse and its sustainable tiles in the home of Maggie Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard (which I know because of this jaw-dropping house tour). Heath\u2019s three-piece Basic Ceramic Dinnerware Set features a dinner plate, a salad plate, and a cereal bowl, and you can mix and match different glazes, including the exceptionally named Yuzu Fawn colorway.Varda Basic Dinnerware Set$107 at Heath CeramicsExtra credit: Make your own ceramic dinnerwareExplore Bon App\u00e9titDinner PartiesPartiesCultureLifestyleShoppingRecipes you want to make.
