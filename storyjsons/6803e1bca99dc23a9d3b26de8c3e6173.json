After months of steaming sweet potatoes, roasting carrots, and cursing my weather app, when asparagus bouquets finally hit the farmers\u2019 market, I don\u2019t like to do much to them. I\u2019ll shave raw stalks into a bracing salad or toss slices into a tangle of miso-tahini noodles, but once I tasted senior food editor Andy Baraghani\u2019s new asparagus stir fry, I couldn\u2019t get it out of my head.The asparagus shards were crisp-tender and buttery, and generously dusted with a shower of sesame seeds and cilantro leaves. What really sold me was the sauce: A light soy dressing spiked with orange juice and smoothed with a knob of butter that coated each asparagus stalk, even the paintbrush-like tips. I begged Andy for an advance copy (just a peek!) of the recipe until finally, he caved. Then I roamed the farmers\u2019 market like a hypebeast hunting a pair of Supreme x Vans slip-ons until I found a perfect, perky bunch.Andy is famous in the BA test kitchen for his uncompromising aesthetic, and here, each stalk is cut on the arty diagonal\u2014but it isn\u2019t just for looks. Those  \u00bc\" slices cook hot and fast, which develops the flavor with little risk of overcooking. Like all stir-frys, the trick is to get your pan roaring hot before adding the ingredients. Start by saut\u00e9ing the sliced garlic and Fresno chiles, then add the asparagus and cook.And good news, that citrusy soy sauce happens in the same pan. When the asparagus is beginning to brown around the edges, add soy sauce, butter, and a 1 Tbsp. water, then toss constantly until the asparagus is still crisp but cooked through and coated in a glossy, emulsified sauce.  Brighten things up by adding orange juice and zest to the pan, and top the final dish with plenty of torn cilantro and sesame seeds.This recipe would be an excellent side dish for grilled chicken or crispy tofu, but I went the minimalist route and served the stir-fry over white rice with plenty of dressing spooned over. Oh, and an extra squeeze of orange, just for the hell of it. It was the quickest dinner I\u2019ve made in months, and one I\u2019m already planning to make again next week. We only have a few weeks of asparagus season, and if my pee smells forever, that\u2019s a risk I\u2019m willing to take.Secure your asparagus:Simple and Citrusy Asparagus Stir-FryThe trick to this citrusy stir-fry is to get your pan roaring hot before adding the ingredients.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishAsparagusStir-FryRead MoreLifestyleGreen Minestrone Is Here to Justify Your Spring Farmers' Market SplurgeBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
