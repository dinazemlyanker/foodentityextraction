Three women were huddled up, while one was regaling the other two about her new diet and how much she had lost.\u201cBut what if you don\u2019t like sweet potatoes?\u201d asked one of them with an urgency in her voice that seemed almost irrational.\u201cHow much have you lost already?\u201d asked the other, wide-eyed and in awe.I washed my hands, walked out, and thought, \u201cI\u2019m glad I will never be like that again.\u201dThat\u2019s when I realized that, for the first time in my life, I truly felt \u201cfood freedom.\u201d And I have Whole30 to thank for it.As far back as I can remember, I loved food. Even when I was a baby, according to my mother, I would eat everything that was put in front of me. As I grew older, that love for food continued to grow. However, so did the realization that I was bigger than the other girls. I was conscious of this from a young age: I went on my first diet at the age of 11 and had a heavy workout regime by 12.I spent years counting things: calories, fat, carbs, sugar. I used to sit at meals with my friends and not understand how they could just eat everything in sight and be so thin while I was picking like a bird and never losing weight. I often felt shame for eating what I wanted, and disappointment in myself for not sticking to salads with grilled chicken. I got used to feeling constantly not good enough.Then I met someone who made me feel more than good enough. And I wanted to match how I felt on the inside to how I looked on the outside. So I decided to try a round of Whole30. I\u2019ve heard some people call it \u201cthe Navy Seal training of diets,\u201d and they aren\u2019t wrong. Whole30 does require a lot of focus and strength because of all the restrictions\u2014no white or wheat flour, no sugar, grains, dairy, alcohol (this almost killed me), or legumes. No cheat days, no days off and no replacement goodies (creating versions of your favorite treats using Whole30-approved ingredients).Some people get obsessed when they jump on Whole30. My cousin was one of those people, and she leveled with me about it before I started. She found herself completely consumed with everything she was eating and not eating. But my experience was completely different. For the first time in my life, I felt more free than I had...ever. I wasn\u2019t counting anything. I stuck to the shopping list and was making delicious meals at home. I didn\u2019t feel bad about saying no to wine, even though all I wanted was a glass of good ros\u00e9 most nights. I ate out a few times (I did try to minimize this, but life happens) and did not feel a bit of guilt about demanding a custom-built meal.I\u2019m not saying this was easy. Once I had a craving that was so intense I almost grabbed an ice cream cone from a random stranger. But watching the weight fall off faster than it ever had without logging every bite into an app was like actually living the end of the movie \u201cAladdin\u201d when Genie is set free. No more cuffs. I did two more months of Whole30 quick succession.Almost two years later, and I will tell anyone truthfully that I don\u2019t think about diets. My weight doesn\u2019t consume me. While I do stay compliant for most meals, there are nights when I eat tacos with my sister. There are also times that I eat cookies that I baked with my niece. And I don\u2019t feel a bit of guilt, shame, or remorse when I do. Instead of an every-morning ritual, I step on the scale maybe once a month.Whole30 completely rewired my brain. I am not only healthier physically, but emotionally and mentally. I pay attention to how my body feels because now, I can tell when it\u2019s not in its best shape. I know I need to reign it in by the way my jeans fit. I know I need to add more vegetables back into my diet by how hard I can go when I work out. And I know when another round needs to happen because my body is asking for a refresh.Yes, Whole30 is hard. But those 30 days just may change your life. They definitely changed mine.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyTrendsessayRead MorecultureThe Keto Diet Crushed My Soul But Taught Me One Good ThingBy Molly Guinn BradleyRecipes you want to make.
