But why make it for myself when I could have scrambled eggs for the fortieth day in a row?Well, Andy had a good point: A savory galette is great hot, cold, or at the ambient temperature of your kitchen, just as welcome at 8 p.m. as at 10 a.m. In other words, it\u2019s a meal prep recipe without the meal prep. This one is full of spicy Swiss chard, so you don\u2019t have to make (or, uh, think about making) a salad, and there\u2019s lots of parm, so you can save the \u201cmeal\u201d where you hack at a block of cheddar cheese for another time.\u201cWe always talk about how one of life\u2019s greatest joys is to cook for others,\u201d says Andy, \u201cbut there\u2019s also something satisfying in refining the craft for yourself.\u201d For Andy, cooking solo is the best opportunity to try something new in the kitchen: If it\u2019s a failure, no one has to know (and you can retreat back to that bowl of cereal). If it\u2019s a raging success, you get to reap all of the rewards.The dough for this galette was just the kind of experiment Andy needed time to work through alone. Unlike his usual formula, this one skips the butter and relies instead on a combination of olive oil and yogurt. At first, it was so delicate that it was tricky to roll out and serve. The next round, though, was thin and cracker-like, missing the air pockets that create flaky layers. Eventually, he found the ratio of oil, yogurt, and flour that yielded the perfect tender, tangy crust.I asked Andy how someone who\u2019s made this galette for themselves should eat it: \u201cDinner. Breakfast. Lunch. In that order.\u201d If you\u2019re the kind of person who gets bored fast, eat your first slice for dinner warm from the oven, slide on a fried egg for breakfast, and turn it into a lunch with a dollop of yogurt.It\u2019ll be gone before you know it. And you\u2019ll only have yourself to thank.Get the recipe:Olive Oil Galette With Spicy GreensWhile butter is the usual choice for galette or pie dough, a combination of olive oil and yogurt gives this crust a flaky texture and a golden brown color when baked. If the dough is a little crumbly when rolling it out, don\u2019t worry: Just patch it back up.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyish Guide to Being AloneHealthyishCoronavirusRead MoreLifestyleThe Healthyish Guide to Being AloneBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
