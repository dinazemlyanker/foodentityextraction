Check out their spring issue, and click here to read more about how to make cannabis delicious.Listen, you don\u2019t have to be a master chef or cannabis connoisseur to make legit weed butter. You just need to be well-informed, patient, and organized. At the end of the day, making cannabis butter is just a very efficient way of consuming weed. It\u2019s inconspicuous, versatile, and approachable. And I really enjoy how cannabutter helps to minimize the stigma of weed\u2014especially in the black community. It means everything to me when middle-aged black women, like my 80-year-old great Auntie Mildred, can be provided with options like cannabis edibles to help find relief from pain symptoms.With the same principles as making weed butter, you can create infused sesame chili oil to drizzle on rice dishes, or elevated coconut oil to use for your next face oil mask.The following recipe loosely translates into 30 mg of THC per tablespoon of oil or butter. Your perfect dose will vary, but 10 mg is standard. Start by testing \u00bc teaspoon of the weed butter you make and wait for about an hour. Take note of how you feel and let your body tell you whether this is a good amount, if you need more, or if you need less. Erring on the side of caution will ensure that you actually enjoy yourself and have a positive experience.Step 1: DecarboxylationThe first thing you\u2019ll have to do is decarboxylate your cannabis. Also known as \u201cdecarbing,\u201d this requires you to bake your weed, allowing the THC, CBD and other cannabinoids to activate. Also, it allows for lipids in butter and oil to easily bind to your weed for the ultimate cannabis infusion.What you\u2019ll need:\u00bd ounce of weedHand grinder or scissorsGlass baking dish or sheet panOvenWhat to do:Preheat the oven to 220\u00b0 F.Gently break apart the desired amount of weed using a hand-grinder, scissors, or with hands until it\u2019s the perfect consistency for rolling a joint\u2014 fine, but not too fine. Anything too fine will slip through cheesecloth (or a joint, for that matter). You want your cannabutter and oil to be clean and as clear as possible.Evenly spread your plant material onto the glass baking dish or sheet pan. Pop in the oven on the center rack for 20 minutes if using old or lower quality weed; 45 minutes for cured, high-grade weed; or 1 hour or more for anything that has been recently harvested and is still wet.Check on the weed frequently while it\u2019s in the oven, gently mixing it every 10 minutes so as to not burn it. You will notice that the color of your herb will change from bright green to a deep brownish green. That\u2019s when you know it has decarboxylated.Step 2: Cannabutter Stovetop InfusionIf you have weed, fat, time, and a kitchen, you can make weed butter with this method.What You\u2019ll Need:1\u00bd cup water8 ounces clarified butter, melted butter, or oil\u00bd ounce decarboxylated cannabisMedium saucepanWooden spoonThermometerCheesecloth and/or metal strainerWhat to do:In a medium saucepan on very low heat, add water and butter.When the butter is melted, add the decarboxylated cannabis. Mix well with a wooden spoon and cover with lid.Let mixture gently simmer for 4 hours. Stir every half hour to make sure your butter isn\u2019t burning. If you have a thermometer, check to make sure the temperature doesn\u2019t reach above 180\u00b0.After 4 hours, strain with cheesecloth or metal strainer into a container. Let the butter cool to room temperature. Use immediately or keep in refrigerator or freezer in a well-sealed mason jar for up to six months.How to use weed butter:I\u2019ve been slipping a little weed into a lot of recipes that aren\u2019t in my cookbook. Most recently, I combined one tablespoon of canna-infused olive oil with 3 tablespoons of non-weed virgin olive oil to dress this juicy Charred Raw Corn salad. (It came out to 30 mg for the entire dish, and 7.5 mg per serving). It blew my mind. And not because I was stoned. I also have this thing for eating hot soup all year long, and my most recent soup fix was Chicken and Rice Soup with Garlicky Chile Oil. I spiked the garlic chile oil with weed, swapping in two tablespoons of canna-infused sesame oil for two tablespoons of vegetable oil. You can also sub a few teaspoons of infused oil into baked goods, like breakfast blondies or chocolate tahini brownies.Find more recipes for cooking with cannabutter in The Art of Weed Butter, available for $10 on Amazon or wherever books are sold.The Art of Weed Butter$22 $15 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishCannabisWomen in CannabisRead MoreLifestyle5 Chefs Who Are Breaking Stereotypes About \u201cWeed Food\u2009\u201dGallery5 SlidesBy Helen HollymanRecipes you want to make.
