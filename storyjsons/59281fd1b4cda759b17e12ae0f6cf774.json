I'm in love.By Aliza AbarbanelJune 18, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Andy Baraghani, Prop Styling by Emily EisenFacebookTwitterEmailEach summer, I divide food into two categories: picnic food and everything else. If I can\u2019t eat it outdoors, surrounded by friends with an Aperol spritz in hand, I\u2019m not interested.These grilled carrots with avocado are the epitome of picnic food: fresh and delicious, especially at room temperature. Growing up, I regularly ate a version of this dish at Huckleberry, a seminal L.A. all-day cafe. Their version used cilantro and oven-roasted carrots, but, we figured, why turn on another appliance if you have the grill going already?Accordingly, senior food editor Andy Baraghani's take on this classic cold salad features grilled carrots, a honey-chile dressing, and fresh mint. \u201cYou have really really nice, charred carrots, and then the smoky cumin, some heat from the chile, sweetness from honey, bright herbs,\u201d says Baraghani. \u201cThe neutralizing avocado cuts through the heat and smokiness.\u201dStart by preparing a grill for medium heat. If you don\u2019t have access to a grill because you live in a tiny apartment, same. Just preheat your oven to 425 and crank up your kitchen fan if it\u2019s especially toasty. You\u2019re going to sweat for these carrots, and it\u2019ll be worth it.Toast cumin seeds in a small dry skillet over medium heat until fragrant, tossing often to prevent burning. Once cooled, coarsely crush them with a mortar and pestle (or just the flat side of a chef\u2019s knife) and transfer to a large bowl. Add lemon juice and honey, whisk in \u00bc cup of olive oil until emulsified, then stir in a thinly sliced serrano chile and some finely grated ginger. Let it hang out on the counter until everything is ready to serve, which will give the aromatics time to really infuse into the dressing.This recipe really allows carrots to shine, so do them justice with a good scrub. Trim the tops to about one inch, and halve the carrots lengthwise, so you still have that distinctive carrot shape. Don\u2019t bother peeling them\u2014not only do the thin skins pack lots nutrients, but you\u2019ll also get a better char with them on. Leave any especially skinny carrots whole, and whack any especially thick carrots into quarters so they\u2019re all relatively uniform. Toss them with two tablespoons of olive oil and some salt, then grill them, turning occasionally, until lightly charred in spots and tender, 14\u201318 minutes. Immediately transfer carrots to the bowl with sauce and toss to coat, to ensure the sauce coats evenly. We\u2019re going for maximum spicy-sweet goodness here.Now, it\u2019s time to cut the avocado. Think big, audacious hunks, not dainty cubes. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see chopped avocado, ever, on anything,\u201d says Andy. \u201cIt\u2019s boring to eat.\u201d Strong words from a man who has opinions on everything from herb placement to cabbage color (for grilling, always use purple), but trust me: He\u2019s right. Big avocado chunks swathed in honey and little salt specks are downright luxurious, especially when you consider how much a good avocado can cost.Arrange avocado and carrots on a platter, spoon any remaining sauce over, then top with mint leaves. You can go ahead and serve right away, but I love this salad best at room temperature. Find a festive beverage, some friends, and a spot in the sun. Then dig in\u2014and try not to eat all the avocado first. Get all the ingredients in one bite, and you'll see how truly perfect this salad is.Get the recipeGrilled Carrots with Avocado and MintYou actually don\u2019t have to bother with peeling the carrots for this recipe\u2014not only do the thin skins pack lots nutrients, but you\u2019ll also get a better char with them on.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishCarrotGrillAvocadoSaladSummer SidesRead Morecooking55 Healthy Grilling Recipes to Make This SummerGallery65 SlidesBy Ali FrancisRecipes you want to make.
