He also prefers a blend of two parts shorter dried chiles (prik haeng) and one part longer chiles (prik chee fah), but any Thai chile will work.IngredientsMakes about 1 cup1tsp. black peppercorns1tsp. coriander seeds2lemongrass stalks, trimmed, tough outer layers removed, thinly sliced crosswise3Tbsp. finely chopped peeled galangal\u00becup dried Thai chiles, torn or chopped into small pieces2small Asian shallots or 1 medium shallot, coarsely chopped8garlic cloves5cilantro roots or 3 Tbsp. thinly sliced thick cilantro stems11\" piece dried kaffir lime zest or 2 very thinly sliced kaffir lime leaves (optional)1tsp. (or more) shrimp paste, preferably ThaiSpecial EquipmentA large mortar and pestleIngredient InfoPrik haeng chiles can be found at most Asian markets and will often be labeled as dried Thai chiles or just dried chiles. Prik chee fah chiles are much harder to source; the next best equivalent is Mexican puya chiles.PreparationStep 1Pound peppercorns and coriander seeds in mortar and pestle until finely ground (if using a food processor, you will want to grind these spices in a spice mill first). Add lemongrass and galangal and pound until ground to a coarse paste, 6\u20138 minutes. Add chiles (if you want, soak them in hot water 10\u201320 minutes beforehand to soften and make them easier to break up) and pound until pasty, 6\u20138 minutes. Add shallots, garlic, cilantro roots, and kaffir lime zest, if using, and pound until everything comes together in a relatively smooth paste, about 5 minutes. Mix in shrimp paste; taste and add more if needed.Step 2Do Ahead: Curry pastes are best consumed the day they are made, but you can freeze any leftovers up to 1 month.How would you rate Red Curry Paste?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkExplore Bon App\u00e9titCondimentSauceThaiSoutheast AsianAsianLemongrassHerbs & SpicesGalangalCilantroShallotVegetableThai ChileChileDairy-FreeNut-FreeGluten-FreeRecipes you want to make.
