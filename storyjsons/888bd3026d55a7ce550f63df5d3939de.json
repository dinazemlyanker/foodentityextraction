Time slips away inside Hesperios, the all-white shop where racks of soft knitwear line the walls alongside Lena Willhammar ceramics and perfume oils straight from the Madini family in Tangier. This is Hesperios, Autumn Hruby\u2019s highly-curated kingdom and, as of last week, it\u2019s also home to her new cafe.Hesperios began as Hruby\u2019s fashion label, best known for creating cozy minimalist knitwear, as well as a biannual journal of literature and culture. She opened the brick-and-mortar location earlier this year as a calm, utterly lovely \u201ccity retreat.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have a stagnant retail environment where people are just sitting around selling the clothes,\u201d Hruby says. \u201cYes, it\u2019s the clothes, but it\u2019s a whole world.\u201dThe cafe's full cheeseplate\nPhoto by Emma FishmanThe new cafe, tucked to the side past a shelf of her signature knitted sweaters, is helmed by Selma Slabiak, former head bartender of the much-lauded New Nordic restaurant Aska and its downstairs bar Edda in Brooklyn. Slabiak and Hruby met at the Union Square Greenmarket two years ago, when they were introduced by chef Chris Fischer, a mutual friend. \u201cI will forever remember that she was lugging so many hyacinths around,\u201d Slabiak says with a laugh. \u201cI just knew immediately that we would be friends, because we share the same love for the same things. I think that it was just meant to be.\u201dLast week, Slabiak and Hruby happily orbited each other behind the cafe\u2019s marble counter, chatting and passing ceramic dishes as a timer counted down the seconds to ensure my cup of milky oolong tea was steeped to perfection. A sleek water filtration system, programmed with specific temperatures for each variety of tea, glowed quietly in the corner.A wine and beer license is in the works, but, for now, Slabiak\u2019s fleet of non-alcoholic offerings are compelling enough to warrant a trip. The blueberry lavender shrub is lightly floral and explosively juicy, finishing with a restrained note of vinegar. A seabuckthorn and citrus concoction is fresh and just slightly sour, comforting enough to channel a childhood glass of Orange Crush.Then there\u2019s the tea list from white-hot bespoke tea brand House of Waris, \u201cScandinavian-style\u201d pour-over coffee from Irving Farm, and crusty loaves of bread from Meyers Bageri, the artisanal Danish bakery run by Noma co-founder Claus Meyers. Slices of white chocolate cherry blossom cake and mint macarons are available from Burrow patisserie in Dumbo. And, truly, the cheese plate is something to behold.The eclectic shelves lining Hesperios shop\nPhoto by Emma FishmanSaxelby Cheesemongers provides the dairy: fresh goat cheese from Seal Cove Farm in Maine, cow and sheep\u2019s milk triple cre\u0300me from Old Chatham upstate, and a thick wedge of blue d'auberge from Herv\u00e9 Mons in France. The lingonberries and sea buckthorn used in Selma\u2019s homemade sodas find new life as preserves, which are paired with tiny vintage Scandinavian oyster forks and sturdy spelt crackers. There are dehydrated orange slices and scattered berries and a dollop of golden local honey to drizzle over it all.The rest of the menu will change, particularly as summer brings fresh produce to the farmers\u2019 market. \u201cEverything had to earn its place on the menu, very much,\u201d Slabiak says. \u201cBut because it\u2019s such a small operation, it\u2019s really nice that whatever we find we can put on the menu\u2014\u201d \u201cOr whatever we have room for,\u201d Hruby adds.In a classic story of New York real estate, Hesperios used to be a vape shop. That day, it was hard to picture clouds of Cool Cucumber billowing through the neat rows of artisanal jam. Two clementine trees frame the entrance, and a fig tree just waking up from winter marks the entrance to the backyard. Soon there will be a garden here, designed by landscape architect Miranda Brooks. It will bloom with plants like Hesperis and Wisteria and, much to Slabiak\u2019s delight, a herb garden.\u201cIt\u2019s like an oasis. I love that if you\u2019re shopping for a lovely sweater or if you want to sit and read this amazing book that you bought from the bookshop, then you can also sit down and have something really lovely to drink and eat,\u201d Slabiak says. \u201cYou can treat yourself so well here.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishTrendsNew YorkNew York CityShoppingRead MorecultureThis Brooklyn Shopkeeper Is Totally Reading Our MindsBy Elyssa GoldbergRecipes you want to make.
