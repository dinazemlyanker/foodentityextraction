Middle Eastern pop music jangles softly through the speakers. Couples dressed for the heat sip glasses of ros\u00e9 and swirl torn bits of warm Toufayan pita through creamy hummus made from black-eyed peas. The last of the day\u2019s light glows tangerine behind a large sheet glass window etched with big block letters: \u201cEMPOWERING REFUGEES THROUGH CULINARY EDUCATION.\u201d That\u2019s what this tiny Brooklyn eatery does, and what we, by dining here, are helping to do too.In the open kitchen, culinary director Alexander Harris leads a team of five chefs-in-training. There\u2019s Caroline from the Democratic Republic of the Congo; Nadia from the Central African Republic; Kesnelfils, Nagela, and Redjie from Haiti. For most, it\u2019s their first time cooking professionally, though many of Harris\u2019 students bring years of cooking know-how, gathered in the home kitchens of their native countries, before they were forced to flee.\u201cI love challenges, but coming to America was hard,\u201d says Thu Pham, a recent graduate of the eight-week program. Back in Saigon, Pham worked with children in nonprofit organizations. When she arrived seeking asylum in New York City, she had to start her career all over again. \u201cLanguage is really hard for me,\u201d she says. \u201cI have to translate everything in my mind, process it, and try to catch up with what people are talking about.\u201dWith limited resources, Pham struggled to find a job. She\u2019d always loved cooking the food she grew up eating\u2014her mom\u2019s pickled mustard greens, steamy bowls of pho, crunchy-fresh green papaya salad like the kind an old woman used to serve from a small bamboo stand outside her house. Working in a kitchen seemed like a good chance at a fresh start. \u201cBut I needed training,\u201d she says, \u201cand culinary school is really expensive.\u201dThat\u2019s when a counselor at a New York refugee organization told Pham about Emma\u2019s Torch, a restaurant centered around training refugees in the culinary arts, then helping them find good jobs in commercial kitchens around the city. Pham applied and got accepted. She cites knife skills as one of her most important lessons; how to slice through the tender, gnarled skin of a ripe heirloom tomato without crushing it or chopping off her fingers; how to prepare lamb shank before rubbing it with shwarma spices and letting it cook low and slow. For family meals, she\u2019d sometimes cook Vietnamese food for the whole staff: young jackfruit salad dusted with sesame seeds, tender grilled fish bright with turmeric. \u201cI love the atmosphere because we\u2019re like family,\u201d she says of the program. \u201cI get to work with and learn from other students from all over the world.\u201dThu Pham of Emma's Torch in Brooklyn\nPhoto by Emma FishmanImmediately after graduating, Pham snagged a job as a prep cook at Bricolage, an upscale Vietnamese restaurant in Brooklyn\u2019s Park Slope neighborhood. Today, she runs a food blog called Pham Kitchen and is working with several friends on a plan to start a private catering company. \u201cWhen people eat my food and feel happy, I\u2019m happy,\u201d she says. \u201cCooking is a meditation. It helps me relax.\u201dKerry Brodie, founder and executive director of Emma\u2019s Torch, has had no problem securing jobs for her students post-graduation. \u201cWe\u2019ve been welcomed by the industry with open arms,\u201d she says. Of the 16 people who have gone through the training program to date, all who have sought culinary careers after graduating have been placed.\u201cThat\u2019s not just a benefit for our students,\u201d Brodie continues. \u201cThat\u2019s a benefit for all of us. Think about it: Every major food trend, every culinary moment of creativity has been inspired by that which makes us different. When we open up the playing fields and bring in more voices, everyone wins.\u201dBrodie credits diners, too, with a new understanding of how their dollars can affect change. Emma\u2019s Torch has been embraced by the tight-knit Brooklyn neighborhood in which it sits; curious passersby have become regulars have become advocates and volunteers. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing consumers care a lot more about what is going on in the kitchens,\u201d she says. \u201cThe types of values that a restaurant supports are in some ways more important than what\u2019s on their menu.\u201dEmma\u2019s Torch is not alone in its push to dissolve typical barriers to employment. And refugees are not the only group of people for whom the food industry can provide a second chance. Restaurants like DV8 Kitchen in Lexington, Kentucky, and Detroit Street Filling Station in Ann Arbor, Michigan, make a point to regularly hire people recovering from addiction or those who have been incarcerated.\u201cWe view our business as a community resource,\u201d says Phillis Engelbert, co-owner of both the recently opened Detroit Street Filling Station and its older sister restaurant, The Lunch Room. \u201cWe help people find camaraderie, heal, and reach their full potential. Everyone needs a second chance.\u201dCarlito Hurtado of Detroit Street Filling Station in Ann Arbor, Michigan\nPhoto by Nick HagenCarlito Hurtado, now a senior kitchen manager at Detroit Street, is one of the restaurant\u2019s greatest success stories. After serving time for a DUI at a young age, he found it nearly impossible to get the kind of job he wanted in the restaurant industry, despite his passion and training as a chef. \u201cPeople will always ask for a background check,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then they don\u2019t call back.\u201d He took what he could get for a while, working behind the counter at low-end buffets and pizzerias. But then he met Engelbert, who saw his potential and encouraged him to apply for a job at The Lunch Room. He did, and got it.\u201cAt first I was skeptical because everybody was too nice!\u201d Hurtado recalls with a laugh. \u201cI had to adapt. But everybody was more than willing to teach me.\u201d Quickly, he mastered the locally-sourced vegan dishes the restaurant had become known for: bibimbap with spicy tofu, burrito bowls with Cuban black beans, bahn mi on crusty rice flour baguettes. Engelbert hand-selected him to help open their fancier sit-down concept, Detroit Street Filling Station, in August of last year. Today, he\u2019s the restaurant\u2019s kitchen manager and helps lead a team of chefs, many of whom are also recovering from addiction or formerly incarcerated. \u201cI\u2019m seeing more and more restaurants hiring people who have criminal records or are newly sober, trying to get these individuals back to society,\u201d Hurtado says. \u201cFive years ago, I didn't see anything like that.\u201dBoth Engelbert and Rob Perez, founder of DV8 Kitchen, have nothing but positive things to say about their experience hiring \u201csecond-chance employees,\u201d as Perez refers to his staff. \u201cMost people in recovery are denied employment if they share recovery or incarceration to explain employment gaps during the interviewing process,\u201d he says, \u201cbut we are proud to hire staff in early stages of recovery. While it does take more time and slightly more training expense, the benefits are immeasurable. Using your business to provide a livelihood and meaningful relationships for one person can make a huge social impact.\u201dDavid Tobin of DV8 Kitchen in Lexington, Kentucky\nPhoto by Louis TinsleyDavid Tobin is a recovering opioid addict who spent years in and out of jail before going to rehab. \u201cI was snorting pain pills during the day and Xanax at night to come down,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI would do whatever it took to get my dope.\u201d Sober now for more than seven years, Tobin got a job at DV8 Kitchen soon after it opened. Working there not only helps him\u2014it allows him to help others. \u201cWhen I\u2019m out there on the floor, I get to mingle with everybody,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ll ask about your story, and the next thing you know they\u2019re telling you about a son who is going through the same thing. Working at DV8 Kitchen allows me to offer hope and show that change is possible to someone fresh into recovery.\u201dRestaurants can also be a stop-gap against the very real problem of recidivism.  A recent study from the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that three-quarters of released prisoners are arrested again within just five years of their release. Much of this is due to the difficulty of finding legitimate employment once one has justice system involvement on his or her record.Geoffrey Golia, Director of GOSOWorks, the employment arm of post-prison reentry nonprofit Getting Out and Staying Out, says the restaurant industry is one of the largest sectors for placing formerly incarcerated young people in paid internships. \u201cWe find that in restaurants with strong team cultures, there is an openness to giving people this critical second chance,\u201d he explains. \u201cThey are supportive of young people who want to work hard, learn skills, and contribute to what really can be a satisfying, collaborative effort every single day.\u201dRestaurant owners can benefit from more open hiring practices as well. A nationwide dining-out boom (according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, 15,145 new American restaurants opened between 2016 and 2017), coupled with widespread labor shortages, is making it very difficult for restaurants to properly staff their kitchens, particularly when it comes to low-skill but essential back-of-house jobs like dishwashing. And ICE raids and crackdowns at the border are targeting the often undocumented workers who have been quietly keeping commercial kitchens across the country running for decades.Being intentional about leveling the playing field is a win for restaurants, diners, and workers alike. \u201cWe have clients who, through GOSO training programs and restaurant partnerships, have gained confidence, discovered their own business acumen and culinary talents, and moved into management positions that allow them to stabilize their lives,\u201d says Golia.Rose Colbert of Honeysuckle Gelato in Atlanta\nPhoto by Tropico PhotoProof of this potential comes in many forms. Just ask Rose Colbert, who, after a divorce several years ago, found herself unable to pay rent for herself and her two sons. \u201cI went from two incomes to one really quickly,\u201d she recalls, describing one of the lowest points in her life. She ended up having to move her family into City of Refuge, a homeless shelter. \u201cI was really frightened,\u201d she says. \u201cI saw it as a failure.\u201dBut then she enrolled in a culinary training program offered by the shelter, where she learned the kinds of skills that elevated her from minimum wage worker to trained cook. Upon graduating, she nabbed a job at Honeysuckle Gelato, a small-scale ice cream manufacturer in Atlanta that makes a point of hiring people dealing with poverty and homelessness.Within two or three months, Colbert was out of the shelter and living with her sons in an apartment. Three years later, she\u2019s still happily employed, making ice cream, learning about food production, and providing creative input on decisions about products and flavors. Eventually, she plans to open her own catering business\u2014something she says would never have seemed possible without the opportunities provided by both the training program and Honeysuckle.\u201cIt has changed my life,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes you go through struggles to get to the good stuff. I got to the good stuff.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titHot 10 2018The Hot 10Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
