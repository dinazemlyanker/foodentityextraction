Because so many of the ingredients are salty, you don\u2019t need to season the vegetables while cooking. Some brown bread on the side for serving is extra credit, but the big showering of dill at the end is nonnegotiable.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Used andouille sausage which gave a nice heat.KateMaine, United States3/16/2022Definitely going on the repeat/favorite list!!\n\nI followed the recipe using a low salt soy sauce but needed to add a little EVO when cooking the onion because the sausage did not produce very much fat.   Although I had prepped everything ahead of time, we cooked it in between periods of a hockey game and were able to eat dinner during the third period.\n\n We both were so pleased with the results.  Served it with a side salad.ShoretalkNew Jersey3/15/2022Satisfying winter fare, but as another reviewer noted, too salty, even though I added more cabbage than called for and used only 2/3 of the sauce. I would modify the sauce next time to reduce the saltiness. Perhaps drop the soy sauce completely.  It helped to serve it with a good quality baguette, the bread acted like a palate cleanser. BarbaraSeattle, WA3/9/2022Great dish. Very easy. Mustard taste subtle but thumbs up. Lowered soy to two teaspoons, rather than two tablespoons.\n\nOnly problem is the difficult to find, and if found expensive halloumi. I used queso de frier, and sprinkled about 4 extra oz of feta at the end. The queso melted much quicker than the halloumi would have. Next time very high heat, for less time for the cheese. Guessing Indian paneer cheese would work really really. I'm Greek by descent, so the sprinkling of feta made it very homey for me.\n\nCharring the cabbage is the key component IMHO.\n \nI used Aidell's chicken sausage with apples which worked very well, and in the future I would sear the sausages whole, to almost a burned skin, then let rest and slice.\n \nFinally maybe better with 16 oz. of sausage.  \n\nOverall, excellent! Wm Sakas115203/6/2022Made this last night, but my husband and I both agreed that it was too salty for our liking. The flavours were good, but we just couldn't get past the high tolerance of salt. Not sure where the salt was coming from, as I use low sodium soy sauce. Should I make this next time, I may use turkey sausage and coconut aminos in place of soy sauce. Overall, like I said, the flavours weren't bad, it was the salt content.TinaHuntington Beach3/5/2022Delicious and easy to make. Teenage son devoured it and husband was scraping every last little bit out of the serving bowl in the end. Cabbage melted in your mouth and the pops of mustard seeds rounded out each bite.  I used a lite version of Hillshire Farms kielbasa, it tasted good, but had to add a little more olive oil because it was leaner. Next time I will make fresh soft pretzels to serves with it.Dietz MomBay Area CA3/3/2022Pretty quick and easy prep and very easy to cook.  Just make sure you have your vent fan on!  I went ahead and used a whole head of cabbage (smallest I could find) because I dislike trying to find another use for something we don't use a whole lot of, especially something that won't last long after being cut.  Just meant for careful tossing once added to the large cast-iron, as it was very full!  My family didn't mind at all, as the cabbage was delicious.  I did cook it a little longer to ensure the rawness was gone (likely due to overly full pan).  The dill was definitely the perfect pop on top.  Next time, I may finely dice some of the extra raw onion to put on top as well.  Big hit - I will make again!LBinTXTexas2/22/2022I could eat this once a week.  Great German style meal. Used a Johnsonville Polish Kielbasa and Ingelhoffer stone ground mustard (with the dijon).  Could not find the Halloumi in my small town so I used a block of feta and didn't fry it as long as the recipe stated.  I will plan in advance next time.  Salted rye bread with soft butter is a must. A malty beer goes well with this, Octoberfest or Bock would be perfect.RandyAlexandria KY2/17/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titDinnerEasyOne-Pot MealsNut-FreeStir-FrySausageMeatHalloumiCheeseKielbasaGreen CabbageCabbageLeafy GreensVegetableMainRecipes you want to make.
