I have almost every one of Ina\u2019s cookbooks, which makes her my most collected author. And, I doubt I\u2019ve missed any episodes of Barefoot Contessa. Is there anything better than a half hour in the barn with Ina?I remember going into the real Barefoot Contessa in East Hampton many years ago, hoping to catch a glimpse of her. I bought chicken salad and a cupcake and ate them both on a bench outside the store. They were just as amazing as I had imagined.I even wrote a scene in Something\u2019s Gotta Give that was to take place in the store, but by the time we started shooting it was no longer there, so we recreated it in Los Angeles. I hope she approved!I\u2019m clearly a huge Ina fan. Her first cookbook, The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook has been on a shelf in my kitchen for more than 20 years. It has a broken spine and opens almost by itself to two recipes, so those must be my favorites.One is Ina\u2019s foolproof, works-every-time, everyone-loves-it sun-dried tomato dip. It was the first recipe of Ina\u2019s that I ever tried, back when sundried tomatoes were a brand new thing\u2014at least to me. It\u2019s an irresistible dip that works great with crackers or cut-up veggies, and I always double the recipe for parties because it goes fast. It\u2019s smooth, a little tangy, and unexpected, so it\u2019s impossible not to go in for a second\u2014or third!\u2014taste. People often gesture an \u201cOMG\u201d face when they\u2019re eating it.The recipe says to put all ingredients in a food processor and puree them, and then add scallions and pulse twice. How specific and easy is that? She also advises that room temperature cream cheese ensures that the dip won\u2019t have lumps. Directions like that make it feel like Ina\u2019s right by your side as you\u2019re making it.I can\u2019t remember the first time I made it, but remember the last. It was the 4th of July, and when I placed Ina\u2019s dip on the table, I saw my friends, their now-adult kids, and their little ones eyeing it. I tripled the recipe that day because I knew what was going to happen. A crowd formed around the table and never moved until I brought out the second bowl. Three generations, all brought together by the love of one amazing dip.\u00a0Ina Garten\u2019s Sun-Dried Tomato DipFrom The Barefoot Contessa CookbookMakes 2 cupsHere is the most popular dip we make at Barefoot Contessa. Reminiscent of Russian dressing, it is updated with the intense flavors of sun-dried tomatoes and fresh scallions. This takes virtually a minute to make and can be served with crackers, chips, and fresh vegetables. Room-temperature cream cheese ensures that the dip won\u2019t have lumps. The white part of the scallion has the most flavor, but the green also has flavor and it adds color and texture to the dip.\u00bc cup sun-dried tomatoes in oil, drained and chopped (8 tomatoes)8 ounces cream cheese, room temperature\u00bd cup sour cream\u00bd cup good mayonnaise10 dashes Tabasco sauce1 teaspoon kosher salt\u00be teaspoon freshly ground black pepper2 scallions, thinly sliced (white and green parts)Pur\u00e9e the tomatoes, cream cheese, sour cream, mayonnaise, Tabasco sauce, salt, and pepper in a food processor fitted with a metal blade.
