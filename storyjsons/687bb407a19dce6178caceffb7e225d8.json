If you sign up for our newsletter, you\u2019ll get her letter before everyone else.Okay, I have to ask: Have you hit yet another cooking low point, or is it just me? The other day I went into the kitchen to make lunch, only to discover a fridge completely empty of anything but condiments. There wasn\u2019t take-out rice or eggs or even a last little knuckle of parm. I ended up eating graham crackers right out of the sleeve, smeared with peanut butter like an after-school snack.It\u2019s not that I\u2019m sick of cooking, really! It\u2019s just as I started eating out more, I just kind of\u2026stopped planning as much as I used to. And maybe forgot to go grocery shopping once or twice. And yes, chose outdoor brunch over the farmers market. But I\u2019m trying to get back on track. I\u2019ve been scouring the BA archives for advice, tips, and recipes to help. There are so many old recipes that feel very new to me, and it\u2019s been fun to scroll through them, bookmarking things for later use as I get back into the swing of cooking. In particular I\u2019m gravitating toward sauces\u2014these five are a great place to start\u2014and marinated dishes, like this zucchini tossed in a vinaigrette and served over ricotta. Or quick recipes that use up all the veg in my fridge, like this ratatouille pasta (double the ratatouille and turn the leftovers into another meal), or that get better with age, as this make-ahead lentil salad does.Really, I\u2019m just looking for ways to impart big flavor without a ton of time. I\u2019ve gotten super into this ginger-scallion tofu scramble and this ginger-mustard barbecue sauce, both heavy on one of my favorite ingredients (ginger!), and I can\u2019t wait to try this soy-ginger egg scramble, which BA\u2019s Editorial Director Amanda Shapiro calls her \u201cnever-fail lazy dinner.\u201dBelow are a few of the other dishes I\u2019ve been making as I try to ease back into cooking after an early summer filled with lazy, snacky meals and lots and lots of eating out. Please tell me what you\u2019re eating these days too (seriously, I need the inspiration)\u2014as always, I\u2019m at sonia@bonappetit.com.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCultureRecipes you want to make.
