(If that sounds to you like the best parts of French beignets and American old-fashioned doughnuts combined into one, delicious bite, then you\u2019re right). The coconut milk in this recipe, which is adapted from my cookbook Let's Eat, adds a unique mellow sweetness to the dough that doesn\u2019t feel overly indulgent. The key to achieving the perfect hollow mandazi is to continue to agitate the dough when frying by flipping them and pressing them down to submerge in the oil. To make this recipe vegan-friendly, substitute vegetable or coconut oil for the melted butter. \u2014Zaynab IssaAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Microwave until lukewarm, about 15 seconds. (Alternatively, heat in a small saucepan until lukewarm.) Pour into dry ingredients and stir with a rubber spatula until incorporated. Dough will appear shaggy and a bit dry.\u00a0Step 3Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and knead until soft and dough springs back when gently pressed, 13\u201315 minutes. (Alternatively, you can knead in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook on medium speed, 8\u201310 minutes.) Transfer dough to an oiled large bowl, cover with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 2 hours.\u00a0Step 4Transfer dough back to a lightly floured surface, cut into 4 equal portions, and roll each portion into \u215b\"\u2013\u00bc\"-thick rounds. Cut each round into 4\u20136 triangle-shaped portions, depending on the desired size.Step 5Pour oil into a large pot to come 2\" up sides, clip thermometer to sides, and heat over medium until thermometer registers 325\u00b0. Working in batches of 2 or 3, carefully drop dough pieces into oil. They will sink at first, then float to the surface. Once they come to the surface, cook, pushing down, pouring oil over, and turning (this will ensure they puff up and are hollow in the center), until deep golden brown, 5\u20137 minutes. Using a spider or slotted spoon, transfer mandazi to paper towels and let drain.Step 6Serve warm with chai, sweetened condensed milk, or Nutella.\u00a0Adapted from LET'S EAT by Zaynab Issa.

I found the dough very very dry. I added more water to make it soft and smooth. The hydration index does not seem right. I also wondered why you don't show water in the ingredients list? Just because it's free doesn't mean that it should not be on the list. STNiagara Falls, Ontario. 5/7/2021I want to make this, yet please recommend gluten-free flours that would be great substitutes.\nLentil, Brown rice, Cassava, Chick pea, Tapioca, Bob's Red Mill, and or a blending of gluten free flours.\nI am anxious to make this!
