So cute! So collectable! So easy to lose to the chaos of my kitchen!But the mini whisk\u2014the MVP in the roster of my shrunken tools\u2014is not just adorable: It\u2019s also one of the most reached-for utensils in my kitchen. It can do everything a big whisk can do\u2014and then some.I should first clarify: I\u2019m not talking about those microscopic baby whisks that you received as part of a hot cocoa gift set. (Who am I, the Tiny Chef?) I\u2019m referring instead to a whisk I\u2019d actually dub \u201cpetite\u201d\u2014it\u2019s right below medium-sized (mine is 9 inches top to bottom), with a slender handle that\u2019s comfortable to grip and tines that are long enough to be effective and spaced-out enough to not get gunked up with batter or bits.She's beauty and she's grace.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigThe reason I\u2019m always reaching for my petite whisk is because I\u2019m usually whisking small quantities: a cup of flour with some baking soda and salt to go into a cake; mayo, rice vinegar, and gochujang to make a dipping sauce; olive oil and vinegar for a vinaigrette; chopped chocolate with warm cream for ganache; \u00bc cup of heavy cream to top my personal post-dinner ice cream scoop (I realize this sounds crazy); a couple eggs for breakfast. And I\u2019m normally doing these small jobs in small bowls (or, more likely, pint containers) in order to reduce the surface area of the stuff that\u2019ll need washing.Using a large whisk in a small bowl is like squeezing your legs into just-washed jeans: Fits, yes, but without any wiggle room. The little whisk, on the other hand, fits comfortably in all of my vessels\u2014even my mugs and my itsy butter warmer\u2014with enough breathing room to still do its job and get in all the edges and crevices. There\u2019s no risk of cream splatters or flour showers, and by the very nature of its shape, it\u2019s more effective at aerating and homogenizing than the fork you\u2019ve been resorting to.Sure, a big whisk comes in handy if one needs to whisk four dozen eggs for brunch at the family reunion, but mine is allocated to the closet: The only time I\u2019d ever drag it out is if a) I had to play a spur-of-the-moment T-ball came and needed a bat, or b) the power went out and I, for some reason, had to whip large quantities of cream or egg whites by hand.Otherwise, the mini whisk can do what the big whisk can\u2014scramble a reasonable number of eggs for a frittata, make a smooooth pudding, even assist you with a giant pancake\u2014but it\u2019s less unwieldy. How\u2019s that for small but mighty?Buy it: Norpro 9-inch Stainless Steel Whisk, $14 on amazon.comAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
