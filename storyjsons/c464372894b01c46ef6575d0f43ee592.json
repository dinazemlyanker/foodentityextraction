Danny Meyer and his culinary director Mark Rosati are trying to combat that disappointment and build a better veggie burger with Shake Shack's latest menu addition: The Veggie Shack.The beloved chain's brand-new addition is being tested at three locations in New York\u2014Midtown East, Upper East Side, and Astor Place\u2014as well as three additional stores in L.A. and Austin.The Veggie Shack is not the chain\u2019s first vegetarian option\u2014the menu has long featured the \u2018Shroom Burger, a beloved and admittedly over-the-top item that featured a breaded and deep-fried cheese-stuffed portobello mushroom patty. Delicious? Absolutely. Healthy? Absolutely not. In contrast, the Veggie Shack is decidedly more burger-like. It starts with a patty made from a mix of black beans, roasted beets, and brown rice, accompanied by standard burger trimmings like pickles, onion, lettuce, and tomato. A slice of provolone cheese and a slick of vegan mustard-mayo act as finishing touches. The vegan sauce was selected for maximum adaptability\u2014the burger can be made vegan by removing the cheese and swapping for a gluten-free bun (the normal buns contain a trace amount of dairy).Adding a new item to Shake Shack\u2019s pared-down, obsessively-followed menu wasn\u2019t taken lightly. Rosati and his team developed about ten versions of the Veggie Shack over a six month period, with feedback from Shake Shack founder Danny Meyer. \"Right away this one was his favorite, the one you keep wanting to go back for another bite,\u201d says Rosati. \u201cI think it\u2019s the balance of flavors: the vinegar brininess of the pickles, the herbiness of the veg burger, the sweet crunch of the onion. I think when that\u2019s done right it makes you happy and makes you want to keep going back.\u201dShake Shack's patty gets a boost from the addition of pur\u00e9ed dates and diced roasted beets, raw jalape\u00f1os, and raw white onion. A glaze Rosati describes as similar to a gluten-free hoisin sauce helps lock in sweetness. Before hitting the grill, the patties get coated in a layer of gluten-free breadcrumbs (made from a proprietary rice flour blend), which become crunchy and mimic a smash burger\u2019s signature crust. The complete package feels pretty darn close to the chain's signature burger. It's also definitely a lighter option; I would have happily eaten a second.With this new vegan addition, Rosati hopes even more people will frequent the chain. \u201cWhen we opened Shake Shack in 2004 it was about being a community gathering place\u2014it\u2019s why we made the 'Shroom Burger, because we knew it was meat-centric,\u201d he says. \u201cThis new veggie option is on the lighter on the spectrum but is still fun, and now if you\u2019re a vegan coming out with your friends and they\u2019re eating burgers, you can be part of that experience.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishShake ShackTrendsRead MorecookingThese Outrageous Veggie Burgers Make Us Forget that Meat ExistsGallery5 SlidesBy Martin NordinRecipes you want to make.
