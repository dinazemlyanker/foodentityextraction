If you want this in your inbox before it hits the site, sign up for our newsletter.Hi Basically readers,This week the Guide to Better Baking came to a dramatic end with the most challenging (and rewarding) recipe of the bunch, Sohla El-Waylly\u2019s Cinnamon-Date Sticky Buns. The buns themselves are light and feathery, almost like challah or brioche, and the cinnamon-spiked date pur\u00e9e is caramelly and not too sweet.They\u2019re high on my list of things to make as soon as Passover ends (two more days!), along with Soba Noodles with Crispy Kale and homemade bagels. If you, too, want to make the buns but you\u2019re like \u201cHow will two of us finish all of these?!\u201d make a third of the glaze recipe, pour it generously over your portion, and freeze the rest, bare, for later.On Sunday we\u2019ll leave baking behind for more dinner-appropriate Basically recipes, but we\u2019ll still be checking on the baking forum to answer your questions.One Good TipTake InventoryPhoto by Sarah Jampel\u00a0A few days ago my brilliant friend (...uh, can you tell what series I\u2019ve been watching?) Mackenzie sent me this unsolicited photo of her refrigerator inventory list. I took many minutes to admire her organization, her handwriting, her use of recycled paper, and the amount of cheese she keeps on hand at any given moment. (She wanted me to note that this was a fridge primed to make potatoes au gratin and cinnamon rolls for Easter Sunday.) I\u2019m feeling inspired to keep closer tabs on my fridge and to use Mackenzie\u2019s star system to indicate what\u2019s, um, \u201con its merry way\u201d (that is, ready to get used up).The Most Comforting BowlIs Full of Priya Krishna's KhichdiPhoto by Sarah Jampel\u00a0To make it, you simmer split mung beans and rice together, then season it with chhonk\u2014spices, specifically cumin seeds and chiles, bloomed in hot ghee (I used butter). It took me all of 25 minutes from start to finish\u2014the exact amount of time I can leave my computer and feel re-energized but not panicky. Priya shared the recipe on Basically this week\u2014rejoice!Photo by Sarah Jampel\u00a0This Week I\u2019m Going To\u2026Eat posset: I made this stupid-simple dessert\u2014just cream cooked with sugar, then set with citrus juice\u2014to carry me through the week-plus of Passover; it\u2019s creamy, it\u2019s tart, and you get to portion it into cute jars! I used lemon juice and layered in guava jamMake my first Caesar salad? TBH I\u2019ve always thought of Caesar as a bowl of heavily-dressed greens, but Molly Baz has convinced me it\u2019s one of The GreatsTry that frothy coffee thing but with matcha (what I\u2019ve got) instead of instant coffee (what I\u2019ve not got)Read!

You all cared more deeply about the great banana bread vs. banana cake debate than I could have ever imagined. I loved reading your thoughts. A selection:Katie told me exactly what I needed to hear: \u201cI'm happy to say that I agree with you 100%. Even if (and this isn't the case) the sole difference between the two lies in a smidge of icing and an extra hint of sugar, it would still be analogous to comparing sushi and sashimi. \u201c\u201cRcwillman,\u201d on the counter argument, put this horrifying thought in my head: \u201cTurkey on banana bread? Tuna salad? Chickpea salad? NOPE! Some banana bread is like feather-light cake and some is like pound cake. But cake by any other name is still cake.\u201dSuzanne\u2019s husband buys bananas just so he can ignore them, knowing she will make them into banana bread. Oh, is that what\u2019s happening in my apartment?Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
