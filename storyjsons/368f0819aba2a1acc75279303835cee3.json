RossJuly 27, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Katie BennFacebookTwitterEmailWhen it comes to day drinking, I\u2019m all about \u201cmaintaining,\u201d which is simple, at least in theory: The goal is to maintain a nice buzz rather than getting hammered and waking up the next day feeling like you ate a burrito filled with regret (spoiler: YA PROBABLY DID). But maintaining is not as easy in practice, especially when you\u2019re drinking 14 percent ABV wines in the sweaty backyard happy hours of late summer. This is where piquette comes in.Piquette is basically White Claw for wine lovers: low ABV, high drinkability. It\u2019s made by adding water to grape pomace\u2014the solids left over after grapes are pressed for wine\u2014and fermenting it into a deliciously sparkling bev that clocks in between 5 and 9 percent. While piquette\u2019s flavors vary depending on the grape variety, it always tickles your nose with fresh fruit and pricks your palate with salty effervescence that begs for a second round. It goes down as quick as your favorite flavor of La Croix but with the bright acid and soft tannin textures of your favorite p\u00e9tillant-naturel.Also piquette is much more than a fad. Spiked seltzer is a fad; ancient Romans were not messing with spiked seltzer, but they did mess with piquette. It has been made for centuries across the globe as a way to use grape pomace that would otherwise be thrown out. It\u2019s less wasteful than chucking the stuff and it gives winemakers another source of revenue.But as I was saying, piquette is [chef\u2019s kiss] perfect for maintaining. You may beat your friends at bocce while throwing back two cups of chilled Merlot, but you\u2019re probably not making it to dinner. Piquette is different. It won\u2019t leave you with a burrito-size hangover...or any other regrets.3 Bottles We Love:The standard-setter from New York\u2019s Hudson Valley: Wild Arc Farm Traminette, $15 (pictured above)Gamay fans will love these prickly bubbles from Beaujolais: Domaine des Grottes, $21\u00a0You know it\u2019s from California thanks to the citrus notes: Monte Rio Cellars, $22\u00a0Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishUnfiltered Summernatural wineWineessayRead MoreLifestyleIt Didn't Feel Like Summer Until I Drank This WineBy Marissa A.
