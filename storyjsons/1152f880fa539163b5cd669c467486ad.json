I\u2019ll read a recipe multiple times before setting out the ingredients, only to double check each step of the way. I\u2019ll spend full minutes comparing my in-progress product to reference photos, wondering whether I\u2019ve reached the right shade of toasty blonde or if I\u2019m still in roasty beige territory (I wish I were joking).But I never waste time worrying about how I\u2019ll get my confection out of the pan without ruining it, and that\u2019s all thanks to parchment paper, a nearly miraculous heat-resistant nonstick material. When it comes to lining square pans and loaf pans, there\u2019s a quick and effective trick that guarantees success every time: Line the pan with enough parchment to hang over its edges. The parchment flaps don't have to cascade out of the pan, exactly, but you do want them tall enough that you can get a good grip.These makeshift \u201chandles\u201d will allow you to hoist your final product out of the pan, ensuring neat edges without clinging or sticking. This also a) eliminates the risk you\u2019ll scratch up your pan by slicing inside it; b) means that you don\u2019t have to flip over a bar with delicate layers; and c) limits the time you\u2019d otherwise spend scrubbing stuck-on brownie bits.Here\u2019s how to line your pan with parchment overhang:For a square pan, start by lightly coating it with a thin layer of nonstick cooking spray. This will hold your parchment paper in place. Cut or tear a sheet of parchment paper that\u2019s about twice as long as your pan. Fold it in half down its length, then use scissors or sharp chef's knife to cut it into two smaller rectangles. With a little trimming, each should sit flush along the bottom of the pan and rise up two of its opposite walls. Fit one sheet in the pan, spray or oil lightly, then place the other sheet in the opposite direction (that is, perpendicular to the first sheet) so that all four walls are covered. Smooth out any bubbles or creases.For a loaf pan, you\u2019ll need a piece of parchment that\u2019s the length of the loaf pan and about three times its width. Spray or oil the pan, then press in the parchment paper so that there\u2019s overhang on the two long sides. Be sure to spray or oil the bare sides, as well.From here, you\u2019re all set to fill your pan with your creations: layers of shortbread, butterscotch, and luscious chocolate, maybe? And this time, you won\u2019t have to worry about the big reveal\u2014just use the makeshift handles you created from that extra parchment paper to lift your confection without any sticking. Now, you\u2019re free to cut it on a flat surface without stressing about scratching your pan. After all, you\u2019ve probably got more important things to think about.Get the recipe:Tahini Billionaire BarsWe took millionaire bars\u2014shortbread plus caramel plus chocolate\u2014and gave them an upgrade (hence, billions) with sesame seeds and tahini. The shortbread is tender, the filling is gooey, and the chocolate ties it all together.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasically BakingRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
