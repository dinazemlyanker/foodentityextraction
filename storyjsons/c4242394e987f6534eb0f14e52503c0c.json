In \"There's No Better Time To...\" we'll share the little projects we're finally getting around to. This week: Resume the barter economy.The first book club meeting I attended was six months ago. We read Circe by Madeline Miller and the coffee table overflowed with snacks fit for a god: homemade guava jam, figs, goat cheese, grapes, olives, natural wine, and Bacon Wrapped Jalape\u00f1o Popper Lays.I quickly learned that the Book Club wasn\u2019t about literary analysis (even if we had formally named the group chat \u201cBook Club NOT A Snack Club\u201d). It\u2019s an excuse to drink too much on a Wednesday night and talk about our exes. It\u2019s the one special night a month where Danielle, a vegetarian, makes an exception and eats salami.On March 18th, when we were to get together to discuss My Sister The Serial Killer by Oyinkan Braithwaite, the cases of COVID-19 in Florida jumped from 216 to 328. With no prospect of an in-person meeting happening any time soon, we turned our focus to our true shared passions: Connell\u2019s chain in Hulu\u2019s Normal People (it was our December book) and food.Stephanie\u2019s dad got a box of okra and she offered it up to the group. Monica passed it on to me along with homemade kimchi (used later in fried rice and on a pastrami baguette), pepper jelly, and vegan fennel ice cream. I gave her candies I brought back from Japan in October, a container of rice with scallops I made in my donabe, and a couple cookbooks, a not so-subtle-hint in case she was looking for some projects to make us both feel better.And because quarantine lined up nicely with Miami\u2019s tropical harvest time, we traded produce. The long days stuck at home gave me (okay, my husband) time to dehydrate dozens of Lemon Drop Peppers from my garden . Danielle offered cuttings from her chaya tree, a spinach variety that\u2019s poisonous if you don\u2019t cook the leaves, dragonfruit, and her signature jam, made fresh from the guava in her yard. She inspired Rachel to offer up prickly pear pads she\u2019d been propagating.Those who didn\u2019t have a garden found other things to trade: a sourdough starter, furniture, erotic postcards. I sent Christy, a Montessori teacher, a link to free nutrition education from a charity I volunteer with called Common Threads. Somewhere along the line, the name of the chat was officially rebranded to \u201cShare Club \ud83c\udf5e.\u201dThe logistics of sharing IRL were sussed out in advance. We coordinated hand-offs through a Google spreadsheet, wore masks and gloves, and dropped the goods outside, at which point we\u2019d text.  Sometimes we\u2019d say hello from six feet away, sometimes over a fence.On April 9th, the day we were supposed to maybe get around to discussing There, There by Tommy Orange, Miami banned socializing at ventanitas, Cuban coffee windows. The confirmed cases in Florida were up to 16,364 and the death toll in the state hit 354.Home alone instead of surrounded by friends, I double-dipped my finger in the guava jam\u2014it was just as good as I remembered from our Circe spread. I\u2019m choosing to look on the bright side and be grateful I didn\u2019t have to share, but I did miss the in-person hangs. Some were in it for the books and some were in it for the wine. We all were in it for the company and we all wound up with a support system for a global pandemic. Sometimes we share goods, but every day we share when we\u2019re feeling confused, frustrated, angry, sad, or alone.Patricia Azze is a freelance writer and social media strategist in Miami.Explore Bon App\u00e9titThere's No Better Time CoronavirusRecipes you want to make.
