To me, it just feels forced. That\u2019s not the case at Dreyfus in Toronto.Helmed by Zach Kolomeir, the former chef de cuisine at Montreal\u2019s bacchanalian bistro Joe Beef, Dreyfus is an unquestionably charming, unquestionably diminutive French-ish bistro tucked inside a brick row house. The cozy space is imbued with Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois flair, from the handwritten French menu (deciphered by amiable waiters for non-Francophones like myself) to the kitchen\u2019s unrestrained use of butter.After perching at the bar and snagging a bottle of wine from the all-natural lineup, my partner and I happily ordered half the menu. It was summer, so we were especially spoiled: heirloom tomatoes on aioli-smeared challah toast, fried anchovies tossed with shishito peppers, and impossibly crisp pommes dauphine\u2014a dangerous mix of mashed potatoes and choux pastry, deep-fried and served with sour cream and trout roe. It was too much. It was perfect.By the time 10 p.m. rolled around, I was completely sold on Toronto. (I\u2019ll admit my mood was influenced by a few glasses of Beaujolais and the casually chic staff who scribbled down restaurant recommendations on the back of a menu for us in between opening bottles of Champagne for other guests.) And once I returned south of the border, I kept thinking about that meal. Canadian friends warn me that it\u2019s easiest to love Toronto in the heat of summer, but I can\u2019t help but imagine waiting out a winter storm at Dreyfus\u2019s moodily lit bar. What could be more romantic than getting snowed in with a few plates of lobster salad and pommes dauphine as provisions?Go there: DreyfusExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsCanadaRead MorerestaurantsThe Restaurant at Pearl Morissette Offers a Tasting Menu for the Climate-Conscious EraBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
