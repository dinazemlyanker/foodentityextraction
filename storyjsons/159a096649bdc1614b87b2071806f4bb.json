When I was eight, my parents would drink their martinis while I sipped my \u201cwatini\u201d\u2014water and olive juice with a toothpick threaded tightly with olives. Now, at 28, I\u2019m an avid martini drinker, swapping the water for gin and vermouth but definitely keeping the salty, briny olive juice to cut the sharpness of the gin. Which is why I was truly delighted when I sat down at the bar of Atomix in New York City and saw a very delicious sounding riff on the drink: a white kimchi Gibson.To back up, a Gibson is a martini but with a pickled pearl onion garnish instead of olives or a lemon twist. But Atomix\u2019s version goes way beyond that. The restaurant uses Letherbee Gin, a basement-moonshinery-turned-distillery based in Chicago (that was just featured in BA\u2019s gift guide!), as the base for the cocktail. Next, cilantro-infused vermouth (cilantro steeped in a bottle of Dolin Blanc for four days), which adds a fresh herbiness to the whole shebang. And then my favorite part: The bartender adds white kimchi juice, a byproduct of the kimchi made in the Atomix kitchen. It has all the pickle-y flavors of kimchi, minus the heat, and mimics the pearl onion pickling liquid but with a more vegetal flavor. All of that is then stirred with ice and strained into a coupe glass, and garnished with the crunchiest piece of mu, a radish kimchi, and coriander flowers.Oh, and no, you don\u2019t have to sit through the 10-course dinner at Atomix just to try this drink. The minimalist bar is open for walk-ins Tuesday through Saturday. I have a feeling my new Friday night power move is going to be a white kimchi Gibson. Sorry, martinis! But I think I\u2019m moving on.Go there: AtomixExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendNew York CityCocktailRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
