You can also make it in a pressure cooker or Instant Pot, with the same, hammy results.In this new recipe, Carla Lalli Music has a ham strategy: Cut slits in the ham skin (sorry) to help the ham tenderize and for fat to render faster. When we first tested the recipe, we kept it as-is and the ham was slightly tough when the rest of the soup was ready to eat. The cuts solve that problem.The MethodBut First, AromaticsSaut\u00e9 your aromatics (leeks and onions) in the IP until softened. This is a great excuse to buy the clear glass Instant Pot lid to see what\u2019s going on in there. If you don\u2019t have one, you can use the clunky machine lid, but keep an eye on the leeks so they don\u2019t get browned. Then you\u2019ll season them with cumin, cayenne, and turmeric.Ham TimeWelcome to the Instant Pot, ham hock. You\u2019ve got to keep cooking the ham in the pot for three minutes or so, though, to give the oozing ham fat a head start. What a beautiful, beautiful image.Add the Split PeasWhether you\u2019re using green or yellow split peas\u2014all are cool with this recipe\u2014you don\u2019t need to soak them. After the ham fat scene, add in your split peas, salt, and add six cups of water.Press Some ButtonsAnnnd action. Set the timer for 12 minutes at high pressure. As you know by now, that doesn\u2019t mean the soup will be ready in 12 minutes. Allow 20-ish minutes for it to come to pressure, and then once done, manually release.Shred the HamTake the ham hock out (with tongs, hello!), and let it cool for a few on a cutting board. When you can handle it, cut chunks off and put back in the pot to stir in like ham Lucky Charms.Season the Soup with LEMONYou need acid to cut through the fatty wonderfulness of split pea soup. Lemon works wonders in this department. Don\u2019t skip it!The Bonus RoundWhen we first talked about this recipe, Carla tried to convince me to photograph the soup with yellow split peas, because she felt the green sludgy look was unphotogenic somehow. Psh! Our photographic solution: decorate the soup with BACON CROUTONS. While the soup is under pressure, cook bacon, add croutons, and toss \u2018em around for five minutes or so. This is optional, sort of like how breathing is.I Have a SecretMy favorite thing to order at Katz\u2019s Deli in New York is...the split pea soup. I\u2019ve been called a grandma for this, a badge, or brooch I guess, that I wear with pride because my grandma is AWESOME. (She adds bran to all of her soup, from a container she keeps in her purse.) It\u2019s a very good bowl of soup. And guess what? It\u2019s VEGAN. Rich, delicious, completely HAM-less. Wow. As such, you can make this Instant Pot split pea soup recipe without the ham hock and absurd bacon croutons and still have a flavorful, hearty soup.
