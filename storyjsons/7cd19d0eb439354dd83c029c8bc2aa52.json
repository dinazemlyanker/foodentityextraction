One that comes sandwiched between a vibrant tomatillo salsa and topped with a runny fried egg. Most domestic grass-fed beef includes cattle that also eat some grain; the meat is not too lean or \u201cgrassy\u201d and makes for a very satisfying burger. This recipe is from Farm Burger.IngredientsMakes 4Salsa Verde1lb. tomatillos, husks removed, rinsed1small onion, peeled, quartered3jalape\u00f1os, sliced in half lengthwise1Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oilKosher salt1cup cilantro leaves with tender stems2tsp. freshly ground black pepperAssembly20oz. grass-fed ground beef (20% fat)4Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, dividedKosher salt, freshly ground pepper4soft sesame seed buns, split4large eggsPreparationSalsa VerdeStep 1Heat broiler. Toss tomatillos, onion, and jalape\u00f1os with oil on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet; season with salt. Broil until blackened in spots and very soft, 12\u201315 minutes. Let vegetables cool slightly, then transfer to a food processor. Add cilantro and black pepper; pulse until coarsely chopped (3 or 4 pulses). Taste salsa verde and season with more salt if needed.Step 2Do Ahead: Salsa verde can be made 1 day ahead. Transfer to a small bowl; cover and chill.AssemblyStep 3Portion beef into 4 loosely packed balls (5 oz. each). Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high until just beginning to smoke. Add 2 Tbsp. oil, then all 4 balls of meat. Firmly smash down on meat with a heavy metal spatula to create a craggy-edged 4\"-diameter patty; season with salt and pepper. Cook, undisturbed, until deeply charred underneath, about 3 minutes. Flip and season other side with salt and pepper; cook to medium, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let rest.Step 4Carefully wipe out skillet with a paper towel, leaving only a light coating of oil. Set skillet over medium heat. Working in 2 batches, toast buns, cut side down, until golden brown, about 1 minute. Transfer to a clean surface.Step 5Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium. Crack eggs into skillet and cook until whites are just set and edges are crisp, about 4 minutes. Season with salt.Step 6Spread insides of both tops and bottoms of buns with a heaping tablespoonful of salsa verde. Place a burger on each bottom bun, top with an egg, sunny side up, and close burger.How would you rate Sunny Side Burger with Salsa Verde?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (1)Back to TopTriangleDo yourself a favor and make this like Farm Burger does - with bacon and pepper jack cheese.NorburyM in DenverDenver3/9/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titBurgerGround BeefBeefMeatTomatilloVegetableMainDairy-FreeHealthyishFryLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
