The main flavor of this dish is owed to Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s Chief Hot & Spicy curry powder, made specifically for duck and goat. It\u2019s stronger and hotter than your typical Madras curry powder, so it stands up to the assertive flavor of meat. You can purchase it online or doctor up Madras curry powder to use in its place: Combine 3 Tbsp. Madras curry powder, 1 Tbsp. ground coriander powder, 2 tsp. ground fennel seeds, and 1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper. Serve the Curry Goat alongside Fruit Chow, Aloo and Chana, Tomato Choka, and the main event: the flaky Buss Up Shut Paratha Roti.Ingredients4 - 6 Servingsgoat3lb. cubed bone-in goat or lamb stew meatJuice of 2 limes1cup Green Seasoning\u00bdcup finely chopped garlic\u00bccup vegetable oil2Tbsp.

Cover bowl and let sit at room temperature at least 2 hours, or chill up to 12 hours (go the full time if you can).AssemblyStep 2Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high. Add curry powder and cumin and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant and slightly darkened in color, about 30 seconds. Working in 2 batches, add goat and marinade and cook, turning occasionally, until outside is lightly cooked but not browned and marinade darkens in color, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer goat to a plate.Step 3Combine onion, garlic, chopped chile, and Green Seasoning in same pot and cook, stirring and scraping up any browned bits stuck to bottom of pot, about 1 minute, then continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened and translucent, about 5 minutes longer. Return goat to pot along with any remaining marinade. Add remaining whole chile and reduce heat to medium-low. Gently stir to combine, cover, and cook until meat begins to simmer in the marinade and release some of its juices, about 10 minutes. Uncover and stir.Step 4Partially cover pot and continue to simmer, stirring gently every 10 minutes or so, until liquid evaporates, then add just enough water to scrape up browned bits stuck to pot; repeat process of simmering and adding water until meat is falling from the bone and curry is thick and deeply colored, 2\u20133 hours total. Mix in lime juice and season with salt. Top with chives just before serving.How it all comes togetherStep 5Use the silky shreds of roti to scoop up all the various curries, chows and chokas that make up this roti lime feast.Photo by Rey LopezHow would you rate Curry Goat?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (5)Back to TopTriangleI'm so grateful to see a recipe posted for those of us BA readers who live on Caribbean islands with nary a Trader Joe's or a Whole Foods in sight.  All the ingredients for this recipe were in my cupboard (Chief curry powder!), growing in my yard (culantro!  broad leaf thyme! Scotch bonnet peppers!), or available in my grocery store (goat in abundance!).  The recipe came out great - even better since I planned ahead and spaced it over three days, making the Green Sauce on Day 1, marinating the goat on Day 2, and cooking the goat (I used the Instant Pot) and making/assembling the roti on Day 3.  Thumbs up all around the table.AnonymousU.S. Virgin Islands10/13/2021AV8R, I live in Oregon - sometimes Costco has frozen goat! It's also often available from farmers' markets. I suspect it's also available in Asian markets since it's frequently on the menu in Vietnamese restaurants.CKPortland, OR9/10/2021GOAT.\nREALLY.\nI live in coastal Alabama.\nI have have about as much chance of finding goat here as I have in finding a pearl in an oyster.\nNo...the pearl odds are actually more likely.\nBut you guys ARE entertaining.\nGoat.\nIt's right there at the Winn-Dixie next to the ostrich cutlets.AV8Rcoastal Alabama9/10/2021In light of the previous review \u2014 the article intro specifically mentions how you can create the curry powder at home.Anonymous6/7/2021Don't like that they are asking for pre made seasoning (Chief Hot & Spicy Duck/Goat Curry Powder), not easily available to international audiences.Anonymous9/26/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titCurryTrinidadianCaribbeanGoatMeatLambMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreeKetoBraiseKwanzaaJuneteenthDinnerRecipes you want to make.
