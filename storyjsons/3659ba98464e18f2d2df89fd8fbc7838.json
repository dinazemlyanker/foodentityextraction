And we asked them to do it while filming Making Perfect, a six-part video series documenting every success and setback. Somehow, it all worked out...perfectly. Here\u2019s how the Cornbread Stuffing With Sausage and Corn Nuts came together.Find all of the recipes from the Absolutely, Positively Perfect Thanksgiving menu here.The Dream TeamRick Martinez and Chris MoroccoThe ChallengeStuffing can go one of two routes: white bread (in Chris\u2019s family) or cornbread (in Rick\u2019s). Which one reigns supreme?The SolutionRick\u2019s dad flew in from Texas to show us how to make their cornbread stuffing\u2014and it won. \u201cCornbread is scaffolding to which you can direct a ziggurat of flavor,\u201d Chris said, to which we replied: \u201cWow, okay.\u201d The sweetness of the cornbread complements and accentuates the sausage, celery, onion, and herbs, while the addition of corn nut magic dust makes for an extra hit of corn flavor. There are distinct bites of toasted bread on top and an almost-but-not-quite-custardy interior.Watch Rick and Chris try to make the perfect stuffing.\nThe Case for Homemade CornbreadWhile you can absolutely use store-bought, we prefer to make our own cornbread. Why? Well, we have some control issues. Homemade means you get to choose the ratio of cornmeal to flour (we keep it 50:50 for flavor and sturdiness, though cornmeal superfan Rick goes as far as 70:30), adjust the sweetness, and add buttermilk for tang and tenderness. Last year Molly developed a recipe for cornbread specifically intended for stuffing. How convenient! Some stuffing recipes call for stale bread, but we prefer to toast our cornbread low and slow in the oven so it gets crunchy browned edges and a nice roasty flavor.Extreme Amounts of ButterThere\u2019s a cup of butter in this baby. Two sticks. \u201cThis is the most butter we\u2019ve put in a stuffing, ever,\u201d Chris said. Call it Rick Martinez Maximalism, but it\u2019s the crucial source of richness, and because the cornbread is absorbent it won\u2019t feel like too much. \u201cWe took it to the point of greasiness,\u201d Chris said, \u201cand then we backed off, for respectability.\u201dMore Is MoreWe crammed in as much sausage, stock, and aromatics as we could fit\u2014 the cornbread can take it. If the stock pools in the dish when you pour it in, don\u2019t panic: It gets soaked up in no time.Bring the HeatTwo Thai chiles (or one Serrano), give the stuffing a fleeting fire that will either slow you from eating the entire casserole\u2019s worth\u2014or only encourage it.Earthy, funky, wonderful corniness.\nPhoto by Alex LauWe\u2019re Cuckoo for Corn NutsCorn nuts (the bagged ones, yes!) make the cornbread taste \u201clike a better version of itself,\u201d quoth Chris. But they serve another purpose too, Rick pointed out, which is that store-bought cornbread can vary dramatically in terms of sweetness and corniness, depending on where you live. Cooking the pulverized Corn Nuts in butter \u201cblooms\u201d them like spices, bringing out their earthy, funky, wonderful corniness.\u201cWe used the original flavor,\u201d Chris said, and then his eyes grew wide as he realized, \u201cbut what if... you used Ranch?\u201d We\u2019ll leave that fate in your hands.And With Those Leftovers...Make this crazy stuffing fried rice with smoky Mexican chile crisp (ancho, guajillo, and arbol chiles), allspice, garlic, shallot, and a touch of agave. Oh and soy sauce and Thai chiles and jalape\u00f1os. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t work but it does,\u201d said Rick, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201dGet the recipe:Cornbread Stuffing With Sausage and Corn NutsSweet, spicy, sausage-y cornbread stuffing with corn nut magic dust for an extra hit of corn flavor.View RecipeFor more Absolutely, Positively Perfect Thanksgiving menu ideas:1 / 8ChevronChevronExpertly Spiced and Glazed Roast TurkeyView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titThanksgivingStuffingMaking Perfect: ThanksgivingRecipes you want to make.
