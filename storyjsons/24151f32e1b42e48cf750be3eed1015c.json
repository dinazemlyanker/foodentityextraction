Some of our favorites include the long strands of ridged mafaldini with aromatic pink peppercorns; tender agnolotti filled with sheep's milk cheese and a bathed in a delicate honey-based sauce; and the saucy rigatoni diavola for a bit of heat. Of course, you could also round things out with some huge, buttery grilled scallops or seasonal crudit\u00e9 with a salty anchovy bagna cauda. And to finish things off, the immaculate Italian Job\u2014soft-serve gelato, sea salt, honey, olive oil, and fennel pollen\u2014is a dessert unlike any you've ever tasted.WORD TO THE WISE: Put in a special request for the off-menu eggs, scrambled soft and slow with cr\u00e8me fraiche, whipped ricotta, and Parmesan (and topped with black truffle shavings, for good measure). If Robbins is in the house\u2014and in the mood for it\u2014she might just whip up this signature dish for you.THE VIBE IS: high-brow Brooklyn. Wedged into an odd triangular island at the intersection of several streets, the airy, sophisticated space is ideal for a special ocassion, be it a family celebration or an anniversary date.PRACTICAL STUFF: Reservations can be made through Resy or by phone. Lilia Caff\u00e9, which serves pastries, coffee, and paninis (from 11:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.), opens at 7 a.m. daily.
