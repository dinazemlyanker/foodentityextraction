But in my experience, learning how to make a roux is not one of those skills. The process itself seems straightforward: Add equal parts fat and flour to a pan on medium low, then stir until uniform and the desired color has been achieved. In practice, however, my rouxs are pretty hit-and-miss.Sure, sometimes I\u2019ll nail one on the first try and be on my way to perfect gravy, b\u00e9chamel, or gumbo. But then there are the times when things keep clumping together, or the mixture comes out super thin, or\u2014worst of all\u2014the flour just burns before it can incorporate into the fat. When that happens, I usually dump my failed attempt (along with my ego) into the trash and start over. But after messing up senior food editor Christina Chaey\u2019s Japanese Curry recipe twice in a row, I realized I needed help from the pro. Here\u2019s everything I learned:What is a roux?In the simplest terms possible, a roux is a mixture of equal parts flour and fat, cooked together over low to medium heat, to create a uniform thickening agent that\u2019s deployed in saucy recipes like this extra-creamy Lasagna Bolognese, Chicken-Andouille Gumbo, and b\u00e9chamel-soaked Croque Monsieur.You have options when it comes to the fat, but more often than not, roux is made from either neutral oil (like vegetable or canola) or unsalted butter. When used in soups, sauces, and casseroles a roux provides creaminess and density, helps incorporate other fatty ingredients like cream or cheese, and generally binds things together into a cohesive finished product. And gravy, this season\u2019s MVP, is made by adding stock and/or meat drippings to a roux.As the silent x in their name implies, rouxs are common in French cuisine\u2014used in mother sauces like b\u00e9chamel and velout\u00e9\u2014but they pop up in dishes from around the world too. Rouxs are an essential part of Cajun cooking and are also the backbone of many Japanese curries\u2014like Chaey\u2019s winter squash and mushroom curry and the Golden Curry that inspired her recipe.\u201cIf you look at the ingredients on the box [of Golden Curry], it\u2019s pretty much just flour and oil, and then you have salt, sugar, and curry powder,\u201d Chaey says. If you want to see the power of a well-made roux, add one of those gorgeous yellow blocks to a pot of veggie broth. It\u2019ll disperse in seconds, turning a runny stew into a velvety, creamy sauce right before your eyes.How do I make my rouxs better?In Chaey\u2019s eyes, making a good roux largely comes down to practice and intuition\u2014but there are a couple tips that can help you get there sooner.Trust your nose\u201cYou want to cook the flour and the butter until there\u2019s no raw flour smell left,\u201d she says, comparing the telltale scent to pancake batter or biscuit dough. If you\u2019re using butter as your fat, you\u2019ll also pick up on the toasty, nutty scent of the milk solids browning (like when making brown butter). Once you reach that point\u2014note to self\u2014lower the heat to avoid burning.Keep an eye on the colorThere are many degrees of doneness in rouxs, all of which get their names from their various hues. White rouxs are used in creamy b\u00e9chamel sauces, the building block of great macaroni and cheese, and should only be cooked until the flour and fat are incorporated and the raw flour smell dissipates\u2014cook times can vary, but white rouxs generally come together in 3\u20135 minutes. A light or blond roux cooks for slightly longer to develop some browning and is typically reserved for slightly darker foods like turkey gravy. And the dark brown roux, used most often in Cajun food, is cooked until it\u2019s the color of chocolate and ready to lace gumbo with a nutty richness. Word to the wise: Butter will almost certainly burn while making a darker roux, so opt for a fat with a higher smoke point, like vegetable oil, and don\u2019t stop stirring until you reach your desired color.How do I deal with lumps?Your eventual goal is a glossy, uniform paste that coats the back of a spoon (but doesn\u2019t stick). Lumps can form when the flour packs together, but they\u2019re easy enough to break up. \u201cThe best technique is to keep [the mixture] moving constantly,\u201d says Chaey, \u201cand make sure whatever utensil you\u2019re using is flexible enough to reach every corner of the pan, because hidden, forgotten pockets of flour will burn.\u201d Starting with a whisk is a good idea\u2014especially a flat whisk, which makes scraping the corners of a pot much easier\u2014but once the bigger clumps are broken up, you can switch to a flexible rubber spatula or wood spoon.Still, rouxs can be deceptive. According to Chaey, when you add spices to the roux in her recipe, it will appear to seize up almost instantly, looking a lot like the failed rouxs we\u2019re trying to avoid. Fear not, though\u2014this doesn\u2019t mean your roux is ruined. It\u2019s a ruse! (Sorry.) Once you add that paste to your stock or stew, it will dissolve away just like a Golden Curry block, instantly filling your pan with the creamy finished sauce you\u2019ve worked so hard for.Roux La-La:Japanese Curry With Winter Squash and MushroomsIf you love instant Japanese curry from a box, a bowl of this soul-warming homemade version packed with seared mushrooms and sweet winter squash will deliver instant nostalgia.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingtechniqueRecipes you want to make.
