Fried Capers Are BetterIt follows the logic that most things improve upon being fried.By Sarah JampelMarch 15, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Emma Fishman, Food Styling by D'mytrek BrownFacebookTwitterEmailThere are so many exciting aspects of Christian David Reynoso\u2019s new recipe for Rustic Leek and Potato Soup. (Permission to call it a chowder?) There\u2019s the gremolata, where the herbs are fried before they\u2019re crumbled (hello, texture!), there\u2019s the fact that because it\u2019s \u201crustic\u201d you don\u2019t have to deal with pur\u00e9eing potatoes (food mills, blergh), and, last but not least, there are the fried capers.I do love capers\u2019 briny, chilly punch straight from the jar\u2014I\u2019ll chop them coarsely and stir them into vinaigrette or scatter them on top of a fancy composed salad or blitz them into green sauce\u2014but I like them best when they\u2019re cooked. Not only do they release their salty assertion into whatever they\u2019re cooking in\u2014be it oil or sauce or butter and wine (piccata!)\u2014but they also get soft and plump, ready to melt in your mouth rather than pop like a balloon.And when capers are not just gently saut\u00e9ed but aggressively fried, they\u2019re even better. On my list of \u201cFoods Very Good Fried\u201d (which, I\u2019ll let you know, is constantly expanding), capers rank up there, along with green tomatoes, mozzarella, olives, tofu, pizza dough, and choux pastry (which, when fried, becomes a French cruller!). Frying causes capers to open, like flowers blooming in slow motion (and the Dominique Ansel marshmallows they\u2019ve inspired). The insides retain some moisture, but the exteriors dry out, turning brown and crisp. Now, they\u2019re not just a salty contrast, but a salty, crunchy contrast\u2014a logical crown atop polenta, brothy beans, charred, roasted cauliflower, yogurt dip, tomato toast, and, of course, creamy chowder.Frying capers is a bit more work than opening up a jar, sure\u2014but it\u2019s worth it. To do it, you\u2019ll first want to dry your capers well. Pat them down on a kitchen towel. The drier they are, the less they\u2019ll sputter and the crispier they\u2019ll become. Then heat your oil in a skillet or, to reduce chances of splattering, a high-sided saucepan. You\u2019ll want about \u00bc\u2013\u00bd\". Wait for the oil to get hot: It should be shimmering. You can see if it\u2019s ready by adding just ONE caper first; it should sizzle immediately. Add the capers, working in batches if you\u2019re doing a lot at once (otherwise, you\u2019ll cool the oil down)\u2014and fry until they start to open up and turn brown, as few as 30 seconds and as long as 3 minutes, depending on your oil temp. Remove the capers from the oil with a slotted spoon or skimmer and let drain on a lined sheet pan. They\u2019ll crisp as they cool.Now you have snackable capers, but you also have another gift: caper-infused oil. For Christian\u2019s soup, he uses that flavorful oil as the base for his saut\u00e9ed aromatics. Use it as the base of a salad dressing or drizzle it over smashed potatoes or a big plate of sliced tomatoes. The world, as no one says, is your caper.Get the recipe:Rustic Leek and Potato Soup With Fried Herb GremolataA creamy potato soup without the pur\u00e9eing, plus a crunchy, fresh topping you'll want to scatter on everything.View RecipeRecipes you want to make.
