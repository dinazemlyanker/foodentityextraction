I tried fancy soap, but soap is no longer fun. I tried booze, but delivery can be a pain; I tried flowers, but I hit a point where I was sending floral arrangements for so many reasons that they kind of lost all meaning.I was near giving up\u2014and then I found these Graf Lantz wine charms that come neatly arranged on a greeting card, ready to write, stamp, and send. The company specializes in colorful merino wool felt products (many of which\u2014like these trivets and placemats\u2014are on sale until 2/19), and these wine charms in particular are great because they\u2019re chic and minimalist, unlike the more gaudy baubles you might picture when you hear the phrase. I love them because they\u2019re fun and festive, affordable and thoughtful\u2014a small gift and a personal note all in one. Sure, the cards may imply \u201cbetter unpack those stemmed wine glasses\u201d and \u201ccan\u2019t wait to invite myself over,\u201d but they do so with a really fun energy, especially when paired with the heartfelt note you\u2019ll pen to congratulate your sibling or former roommate on their move. Plus, it\u2019s a gift that clocks in under $16, including the stamp you\u2019ll need to attach.Merino Wool Felt Wine Charms$14 at Graf LantzThere are four options for messages on the front of the card, ranging from Joy! to Salud!, each with its own colorway. Seven felt wine charms are affixed to the front in a flower-like design (more sustainable than a bouquet!); they detach from the cardstock and can be reused for gatherings small and large well into the future. The back of the card does provide some information about peeling off and using the wine markers, but I like to add a little aside into my note (\u201chope these reusable wine charms serve you well as you toast your new home and for many more parties to come!\u201d) so the person I\u2019m gifting them to doesn\u2019t accidentally toss them out.I bought a whole stack before the holidays so that I can have them on hand for quick, easy housewarming gifts\u2014and whenever someone I care about has something to celebrate. Pair the card with some new stemware, matching coasters, or a bottle of something you love\u2014red, orange, white, spirit-free\u2014or just pop one in the mail to wish someone well.If you just moved, let this also be a reminder: Don\u2019t forget to send your friends your updated address. Maybe you\u2019ll get a little something in return.Wine charmed:Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
