Father-son team Antonio and Agostino Fiasche use their line of spectacularly cured meats\u2014including their legendary nduja, the spicy spreadable salami\u2014as the foundation for out-of-this-planet combos.ORDER THE: Dante, for a sampling of all the cured deliciousness, including soppressata, mortadella, finocchiona, hot coppa, porchetta. But you also definitely need to try one of the messiest, most glorious breakfast sandwiches of all time: The Potato Nator.IF YOU DARE: Try the ultra-creamy nduja gelato. It\u2019s the new bacon!THE VIBE IS: not exactly a villa in Lake Como. Order off the hand-written menu above the deli case, which is stocked with cheeses and meats and terrines and all kinds of deliciousness. Then grab a seat at one of tables.PRACTICAL STUFF: Seating is tight, and at peak hours, there might be a line. But generally the vibe is low-key.\u2014Julia KramerWill Blunt - StarChefsWill Blunt - StarChefsWE ALSO LOVELa ChaparritaOur favorite Mexican food in Chicago. There.
