This homage swaps out the macerated berries for candied cucumbers, flavors the whipped cream with lime zest, and uses toasted almonds to provide the texture and bite typically provided by the crunchy meringue.

Morton kosher salt6medium Persian cucumbers or 1 large English hothouse cucumber (about 1 lb.), peeled, cut into 1\" pieces2tsp. vanilla extractWhipped cream and assembly1cup sliced almonds2cups chilled heavy cream\u00bdcup sugar, dividedZest of 1 lime1vanilla bean, split lengthwisePreparationCandied cucumbersStep 1Preheat oven to 350\u00b0. Bring sugar, salt, and 2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Reduce heat, carefully add cucumbers, then vanilla and simmer gently 10 minutes.Step 2Using a slotted spoon, transfer cucumbers to a parchment-lined baking sheet; spread out in a single layer. (Save the infused syrup! It\u2019s great in cocktails or any drink you want to add a subtle cucumber flavor to and will keep airtight up to 3 months.) Bake cucumbers until almost tacky (you don\u2019t want them to be too wet), 12\u201315 minutes. Let cool on baking sheet.Whipped cream and assemblyStep 3While the cucumbers are cooling, toast almonds in a small skillet over medium heat, stirring often, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let cool.Step 4Whisk cream and 2 Tbsp. sugar in a chilled medium bowl until soft peaks form (chilling the whisk so it\u2019s cold is a good idea too!).Step 5Add lime zest and scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; discard pod. Add remaining sugar and whisk until firm peaks form.Step 6To assemble, set 4 candied cucumber pieces and a generous tablespoon or two of almonds aside. Layer lime whipped cream, remaining cucumbers, then remaining almonds in tall glasses, ending with lime whipped cream. Top each with a reserved piece of candied cucumber and some of the reserved almonds.How would you rate Candied Cucumbers With Vanilla Whip?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (3)Back to TopTriangleThis was just weird. The limey whipped creme was good thoughAnonymousSan Francisco 10/5/2020I liked this unique refreshing dessert! It was quick and easy to make. My guests were pleasantly surprised. I added just a touch of lime juice to the whipped cream. AnonymousColumbus Ohio9/27/2020I really wanted to love this but it was among the worst desserts and bon appetit recipes i've ever made! The candied cucumber was a horribly unpleasant texture, and the taste was strange and terrible. They brought down everything else they touched- I wasn't able to stomach whip cream or almonds for days after just from the association. I've never seen my entire family fail to finish dessert before. That said, every other component besides the cucumbers was delightful!
