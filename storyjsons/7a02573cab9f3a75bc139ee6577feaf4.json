The French brand\u2019s newest collection is a 7-piece set that includes a 10-inch frying pan, 2-quart sauce pan, 3-quart saut\u00e9 pan, and a 7-quart stockpot.Known for its ceramic and enameled cookware, Le Creuset designed the new pieces in the same iconic style you know and love, but with a cook\u2019s essential material. Le Creuset also created a two-piece nonstick, stainless steel frying pan set; both will be officially available for purchase on April 15, but those who simply can\u2019t wait can get their hands on open stock now. Prices are in the All-Clad range, from a $120 saut\u00e9 pan to a 13-piece set for nearly $1,000.Le Creuset\u2019s classic enameled cast iron Dutch ovens are great for braises, baking bread, and even weeknight pasta. But you still need that stainless steel pot to boil pasta water, or the saucepan to reheat soup or make oatmeal, and the saut\u00e9 pan for fish with the crispiest skin (more on that technique here). There\u2019s a reason they\u2019re in our list of 12 kitchen tools you absolutely need, no matter what level of cook you are. The stainless steel pots and pans have an aluminum core that is surrounded by two layers of stainless steel, making them safe to cook with sans any fear that a weird metallic-y taste will hang around your food. The lids have the same signature circular pattern as the Dutch oven lids.Le Creuset\u2019s Dutch ovens\u2014cocotte if you\u2019re French\u2014are pretty much flawless in every way (and have been re-released in a rainbow of seasonal and trendy colors and shapes that people can\u2019t get enough of). Likewise, we\u2019re expecting the stainless steel set to be sturdy enough to last a lifetime.See some of the new pieces, below.Le CreusetLe CreusetLe CreusetYou\u2019ll Need a Stainless Steel Pan for This:Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingToolsTrendsRead MorecultureLe Creuset's Heart-Shaped Cookware Is Perfect for Valentine's DayBy Melissa MintoncultureLe Creuset Is Releasing Some Magical Snow White-Themed CookwareBy Evelyn WangcultureLe Creuset Releases a Line of Millennial Pink CookwareBy Zoe WeinerRecipes you want to make.
