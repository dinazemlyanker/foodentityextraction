This recipe gives pizza beans the Margherita treatment, swapping a cooked-down sauce for fresh tomatoes cooked just enough to bring out their full flavor. You can use pristine specimens or damaged goods alike: blistering small tomatoes brings out their sweetness, while simmering large, grated tomatoes is an easy way to remove their tough skins and (flavorless) excess moisture. \u2014Ali SlagleAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

The hardest part is grating the tomatoes which doesn\u2019t take long at all. Second time that so have made this recipe and it does taste like Margherita pizza.\nIt is a hit in my house.MamaWHouston 10/6/2021Easy, riffable, cheap. This time, I mixed the Parm with some lightly oiled panko and herbs and topped it with that. Next time, I think it would be worth making beans from dried for this, since they are the bulk of the dish. NytashaOAKLAND CA9/27/2021I've been wanting to try this for at least 2 years now and after watching these perfectly cut lil videos y'all put together and just got the boost I have been needing to go for it. I think the way these video/instructables are the best way to learn for anyone and I can speak for anyone, we go back like seats in a Cadillac. Marc PowellTroy, TX. but really 817 DFW 9/21/2021I have been doing a Mexican-style version of beans with cheese on bread and it\u2019s a scrumptious and gooey delight. As a pizza lover (who isn\u2019t?) who also enjoys beans, this simple recipe is definitely the next version I will add to my collection.AnonymousNYC 9/21/2021So well done with video as you go along. Looking forward to making this lovely dish Esther 9/21/2021Holy Moly these were tasty. So filling and satisfying. Kids and adults alike would love this dish, and I do like that you can riff on it to make it your own. This will be on the regular rotation, I think it would work equally well with canned tomatoes in the winter for a reminder of summer to come. SarahBoulder, CO9/15/2021Followed the recipe exactly with butter beans. Was so good. Will def make again and will try cannelli beans. RudreshMontclair, NJ9/12/2021had a bag of tomatoes from my in-laws garden and some leftover crusty bread and this was perfect.\ndidn\u2019t grate the tomatoes; quartered the smaller ones and chopped the bigger boys then added some tomato sauce i had in the fridge.. i improvised a bit but it really did taste like pizza in the end and it was delicious!jferleecalifornia 8/19/2021So good! I didn\u2019t grate the tomatoes, just smashed and removed skins after they cooked. Worked out fine.
