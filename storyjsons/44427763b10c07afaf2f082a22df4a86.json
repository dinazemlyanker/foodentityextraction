Should You Get One?Ask yourself these hard-hitting questions.By MacKenzie Fegan and Sarah JampelOctober 9, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesFacebookTwitterEmailAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.We could be coy and write approximately 600 words about rigorously testing 20 blenders in order to determine once and for all who makes the best blender. But we\u2019ll spare you. It\u2019s Vitamix. You know it, we know it, reviewers at Wirecutter, Consumer Reports, and Epicurious know it, and Vitamix and all its competitors know it. We use Vitamixes here at Bon App\u00e9tit, and they are the industry standard in professional kitchens.\u00a0Thanks to their powerful motors and sharp blades, they make the absolute creamiest soups and silkiest pur\u00e9es. They will liquify greens so you can *almost* forget there\u2019s kale in your smoothie. And those coarse foods that a regular blender can\u2019t handle? A Vitamix makes easy work out of grinding nuts for nut milk, crushing chickpeas into hummus, or even turning rice into rice flour.How much will the ne plus ultra of blenders cost you?All this does not come cheap! The Vitamix model used in the BA Test Kitchen, the 5200, clocks in at $458. And while the smaller E310 Explorian is similar to the 5200 and, at $350, less expensive, we\u2019re still talking about an \u201cinvestment piece\u201d price point. (It should be noted that the 5200 and the E310 come with 7- and 5-year included warranties, respectively, so you can rest assured that Vitamix stands by its products.) Vitamix also sells \u201ccertified reconditioned\u201d blenders with 3- or 5-year free warranties; not only do these used machines come at a reduced price, but since you\u2019re not buying new they have a smaller environmental footprint too.Vitamix 5200 Blender Professional-Grade, Self-Cleaning 64 oz Container, Black - 001372$550 $379 at Amazon(Refurbished) Vitamix Explorian Blender, Professional-Grade, 64 oz.

Whether you\u2019re in the market for your first blender or thinking about upgrading your current machine, ask yourself the following questions:Do you often find yourself not making a recipe because it calls for a blender, or, if you already have a blender, being disappointed by the results?If you have a blender, are you using it every day? If you don\u2019t have one yet, do you expect to use it almost daily? Do you know no other breakfast than a morning smoothie?And in addition to those daily smoothies, can you see yourself using a blender for a wide range of other uses, from making almond flour to crushing ice for frozen drinks?Are you a texture perfectionist? Is a rogue lump in your butternut squash soup most unwelcome?Do you have a food processor? Or do you need your blender to pull double duty on heavier tasks like making nut butters and veggie burgers?If you answered \u201cYes! Yes! A thousand yeses!,\u201d you may want to start saving up for a Vitamix.And if not...If you only dabble in blending, opt for a solid consumer-quality machine like the $130 KitchenAid 5-Speed Blender with 56-Ounce Pitcher.\u00a0Or, if you\u2019re short on storage space, consider an immersion blender like the $100 All-Clad 600-Watt Immersion Blender. While it will never be as fast or thorough as a traditional blender, it\u2019s fine for small jobs like making salsa, liquifying a can of whole tomatoes, whipping up single-serving smoothies or milkshakes, or pur\u00e9eing re-hydrated chiles. And when it comes to hot soups, immersion blenders are actually the more convenient choice: Instead of ladling the hot soup into a blender bowl, you can stick the immersion blender right in the pot, hassle-free.Time for soup?Hammy Chickpea SoupName a better activity for an autumnal, sweater-weather Sunday than simmering a cozy soup.
