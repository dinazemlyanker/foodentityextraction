Need we say more? Just keep the sausage intact at first rather than crumble it into pieces\u2014this helps the meat develop a nice crust.Ingredients4 servings8large eggs1cup plain whole-milk Greek yogurt2Tbsp. fresh lemon juice1garlic clove, finely gratedKosher salt2Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil1lb. merguez sausage, casings removed4lavash or large flour tortillas\u00bdsmall red onion, halved, thinly sliced4dill pickles, sliced crosswise \u00bc\" thick3cups mint leavesPreparationStep 1Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Carefully slip in eggs and cook 8 minutes. Transfer to a bowl of ice water with a slotted spoon; let cool. Peel eggs, then slice each crosswise into 5 pieces.Step 2Meanwhile, mix yogurt, lemon juice, and garlic in a small bowl; season yogurt sauce with salt.Step 3Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add sausage and press down on it with a wooden spoon or heatproof rubber spatula to flatten; cook, undisturbed, until browned underneath, about 4 minutes. Turn sausage over; break into smaller pieces with spoon. Cook until cooked through and crisp, about 3 minutes. Transfer sausage along with drippings to a medium bowl. Reserve skillet.Step 4Lay out lavash on a work surface. Spread \u00bc cup yogurt sauce over each, leaving a 1\" border. Top with sausage, dividing evenly.

The flatbreads I got from Trader Joe's were a tad too tiny to roll but they were still great as tacos nonetheless. Will definitely recreate this with all kinds of different sausages, the formula is spot on, and if you already have hard-boiled eggs in the fridge for the week, even easier. alexbeggsBA.com 12/14/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titWrapSandwichBurritoEggSausageMeatEasyFryBreakfastLunchRecipes you want to make.
