Once you get the hang of the cooking method, you can change the star ingredient, the type of fat, add herbs and spices, or incorporate any number of other finishes you likely already have in your kitchen (a squeeze of tart lemon juice, a sprinkle of toasted bread crumbs).A balance of golden crispy-crunchy bits and crisp-tender stems is the goal with oven-roasted broccoli. And those stems are just as flavorful as the broccoli florets, so only discard the dried-out ends. Some thicker stalks can be fibrous\u2014use a Y-peeler or paring knife to remove the outer layer and reveal the tender core. To help with browning, make sure your broccoli is dry before you start cooking\u2014any moisture leftover from washing the vegetable can cause the florets to turn mushy in the oven (if you feel empowered, don\u2019t wash it at all). Finally, don\u2019t overcrowd the pan, vegetables like broccoli need breathing space as they roast; allowing steam to escape helps guarantee those crispy edges.You can serve this simple healthy side dish as is\u2014or pair it with a lemony tahini sauce, pile it on toast with garlicky ricotta and hot honey, shower it with Parmesan cheese, or switch up the spicing to make the veg taste a bit like Doritos.

Check it at 15, 20 mins max. 450 for 35 minutes will yield burnt broccoli.Kevin RAtlanta, GA5/1/2021I love this recipe! It's so simple yet so delicious. My oven is a bit hotter than most so I checked on the broccoli every 10 minutes. The light charring of the broccoli gives it an amazing flavor you just don't get with steamed broccoli. Will make often! Thanks!Anonymous481765/29/2020I made this roasted broccoli to serve with grilled salmon.  Followed the recipe to a \"T\" and it was the temperature and time that I would adjust.  Use your oven thermometer to stay on temperature and start checking at 20 minutes.  My oven is spot on and I relied on the timing and that was my mistake.  I should know better! This recipe is a 2 as written and 5 with adjustment.AnonymousTexas10/20/2017Explore Bon App\u00e9titBroccoliVegetableEasyQuickSideDairy-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreeVeganVegetarianKetoRoastDinnerRecipes you want to make.
