There\u2019s no better way to screw up a perfectly good potato than to boil it and then pulverize it. Mashing it is simply the worst thing you can do. I don\u2019t know about you, but every version of this dish I\u2019ve ever eaten was either too gummy or too chunky, tasteless or under-seasoned\u2014a solid C+ every time. Why have mush when you can have crispy-crunchy taters? Roasted potatoes and French fries exist, and thrive! I\u2019m sure the mash method has \u201cpotential,\u201d but rarely do I see any signs of it.The one exception? Our new make-ahead mashed potatoes, the most perfectly light, velvety mashed potatoes on earth. Chris Morocco developed the recipe to solve every problem that typically befalls the steaming pile\u2014and right in time for Thanksgiving too. But he also did one better by making it so you can cook them days in advance. The approach is simple, but employs a few key tricks that make all the difference, so sit up, and pay attention.The first step is to cook the potatoes\u2014we like yukon gold for their naturally buttery, creamy texture\u2014skin-on in super salty water. Chris says the skins keep the potatoes from absorbing excess water, which is the enemy of a creamy mash, while allowing some of the saltiness to penetrate and give the tubers a jumpstart in flavor. He recommends tossing a solid handful of the Kosher stuff into a pot of cold water that just covers the whole potatoes by an inch, and then bring it to a boil so they all cook at the same rate.Once they\u2019re tender\u2014after about 30-40 minutes\u2014drain any excess water, and let the potatoes hang out in the hot pot (off the heat) until they\u2019ve dried completely. Why? Same reason: Water activates the potatoes\u2019 starch and that leads to gumminess we really don\u2019t want.This is Butter Insulation in action. Ricing potatoes is so easy that even Chris\u2019s son, Alec, can can do it!\nPhoto by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiThat\u2019s also why Chris calls for a technique I like to call Butter Insulation. Essentially, the fat creates a barrier around the potato innards, so it won\u2019t soak in any extra water from the dairy you\u2019re about to add. All you have to do is put the unpeeled cooked tots and butter together in an old-school potato ricer, and push them through the perforated holes like its a giant garlic press. The whole vibe is a bit Play-Doh, but instead of a putty-like product, you get a cohesive mixture and the creamiest, fluffiest mash that\u2019ll hold up way better to the abuse of reheating. (If you don\u2019t have a ricer, you can also use a food mill fitted with a fine disk to the same effect.)Now if you\u2019ve been skimming along with us, time to perk up! The order you add the next ingredients is important: First butter, and then warmed cream and milk. Starches start to bind at cooler temps, so hot liquid means less \u201dstiff mass\u201d and more melt-in-your-mouth heaven. You add the cool sour cream last for a little tang and extra creaminess, and then all you have to do is taste for seasoning, maybe eat a few spoonfuls for quality control, and chill it until Turkey Day.A final stir in of sour cream makes things extra luxurious.\nPhoto by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiThe day-of reheat is super straightforward: Stir the mash in a pot over medium-low heat with an additional \u2153 cup of milk and \u2153 cup of cream. If it looks liquidy, don\u2019t worry! It will thicken into the perfect consistency as it stands in the serving bowl. Just make sure the mixture doesn\u2019t boil, and stir often so the bottom of the pot doesn\u2019t scorch.Spooning this mixture straight from the pot into my mouth, I had to revise my feelings on the mash. Truth is, now I\u2019m actually tempted to make a batch in place of their crispier cousins, served alongside cold-weather meals like braised short ribs, stews, and pork roasts. Done the right way, creamy, buttery mashed potatoes are a damn good way to use a potato\u2014especially when all the work can be done in advance.Get the recipe:Make-Ahead Mashed PotatoesThese creamy, glossy mashed potatoes can be made up to two days before the big night without losing their velvety texture.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPotatoholiday2018ThanksgivingMashed PotatoesRead Morerecipes41 Thanksgiving Potato Recipes We Can\u2019t Live WithoutGallery41 SlidesBy Mehreen KarimrecipesOur 73 Best Potato Recipes, Just in Time for Carb SeasonGallery73 SlidesBy Mehreen Karimrecipes85 Thanksgiving Recipes You Can Make AheadGallery85 SlidesBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
