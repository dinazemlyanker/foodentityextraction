I\u2019m Who I Am\u201dHow do you keep the old customers while also courting the new? Ask 73-year-old restaurateur Frank Guido.By Jen DollApril 16, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chris MottaliniFacebookTwitterEmailWelcome to Red Sauce America, our coast-to-coast celebration of old-school Italian-American restaurants.I\u2019m digging through my wallet for change to feed the parking meter, plunking in coins one at a time, when Frank Guido emerges from his classic red sauce joint, Frank Guido\u2019s Little Italy, in Midtown Kingston, New York, about two hours north of New York City. There\u2019s a bright-orange paper sign in his hand about the size of an envelope. It takes me a second to realize (1) It says FUNERAL on it, and (2) He wants to give it to me to put on my dashboard so I don\u2019t have to pay for parking.The meters are new, he says, shaking his head as I assure him that it\u2019s fine, it was only $3, and, wait a second, there\u2019s a funeral happening in the restaurant right now? Not a funeral itself, he explains\u2014it\u2019s an after-funeral gathering; Frank Guido\u2019s Little Italy gets about 90 percent of them in the area, he estimates. \u201cWe wish they were birthday parties, anniversary parties. But it\u2019s part of our business\u2026. At my age, I know all these people dying. Unfortunately, a lot of them are our customers.\u201dThere\u2019s a kind of poetry to it, though. When your restaurant becomes a place to return to again and again, the line between family and customer starts to blur. In a morbid sort of way, having your funeral gathering at a restaurant might be the greatest compliment there is.The photo wall includes various images of Frank's large extended family... plus famous guests like Robert De Niro.\nPhoto by Chris MottaliniFrank, who turns 73 in April, opened his first business\u2014a pizza place and bar called BG\u2019s in Cottekill, New York\u2014in 1968. The Guido family has owned 26 Hudson Valley restaurants since then. Right now there are three: Mariner\u2019s Harbor nearby, run by Cousin Sal; Frank Guido\u2019s Port of Call, in Catskill; and Little Italy, which opened in 2007 and which Mark Guido, Frank\u2019s 44-year-old son, has recently taken over. There\u2019s a new venture in the works, Frank tells me. He won\u2019t say more, but he admits \u201cthe excitement is opening up and trying something new rather than doing the same thing.\u201dStill, there\u2019s something to be said for giving the people what they want, chugging along with the tried-and-true. In the case of Little Italy, that\u2019s its best-selling chicken parm; the fried calamari, the \u201cTraditional NY Style\u201d pizza with mozzarella and Mama\u2019s tomato sauce (Frank\u2019s favorite), and the meatballs and gravy his grandmother used to make. People are always asking to take the sauce home. They won\u2019t reveal the exact ingredients, Frank says, but they might pack you a 16-ounce container for later.Sure, there have been a few small changes, like a new pizza with goat cheese, pear, and arugula. But why fix what\u2019s not broken?As we head to a quiet table in the back of the restaurant to talk, we pass framed photos of notable Italians like Tony Bennett, Yogi Berra, George Pataki, Luciano Pavarotti, and Frank Sinatra on the walls. \u201cThere's a picture of Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and myself, and I sent it down to Robert De Niro,\u201d Frank tells me. \u201cI said, \u2018Sign this, Robert. And see if you can get Joe Pesci to sign it.\u2019\u201d He laughs at his audacity. \u201cCan you imagine asking Robert De Niro to go get Joe\u2019s autograph?\u201d He said, \u2018Frank, nice seeing you again, but you are on your own with Pesci.\u2019\u201dThere are also pictures of Frank\u2019s grandparents, who came to America from Calabria and Naples, his mom and dad, and his large extended family (he grew up with close to 100 first cousins), as well as his \u201cpaesanos\u201d\u2014the group who grew up together in the Italian community of East Kingston in the \u201940s and \u201950s. \u201cI\u2019ve been friends with these guys for 65, 70 years,\u201d he says. They\u2019re customers too.Frank\u2019s love for the restaurant business started when he was an eight-year-old hanging out in his Uncle Chucky\u2019s bar, where they sold drinks for a dime and hamburgers for 35 cents. When he graduated from high school, he went to Marist College, where he got a Master\u2019s in accounting and joined the IRS. Three months later, he left to open a bar. \u201cIt was in my blood,\u201d he tells me.Mark Guido joins us. It\u2019s in his blood too: He has that restaurant energy\u2014one eye on the conversation, another to whether everything is running smoothly. He updates his dad on the funeral gathering; they\u2019ve been served, and are eating. I ask if he knows all of Frank\u2019s stories. \u201cMost of them,\u201d he confesses. \u201cI know enough to carry it on to my daughter.\u201dAcross from the family wall there are more pictures, bigger and more stylistic; they look professionally shot. \u201cAre those family too?\u201d I ask. \u201cThose are stock images,\u201d Frank says. \u201cThey are just very Italian looking.\u201d These are new additions from Mark. \u201cI just wanted a little different look,\u201d he explains.Mark came into the family business after trying out a string of colleges and landing at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, known for its restaurant and hospitality programs. That\u2019s where things started to click. Then his dad got prostate cancer. When Mark graduated, he decided to come home. Frank got better, and Mark stayed in Kingston. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine working for anybody else, really,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is where my heart is.\u201dThis is a place, after all, where his best friends still live; their parents were friends, too, and so were their grandparents, who came over from Italy in 1911. \u201cThat\u2019s how the families in East Kingston were intertwined,\u201d Frank explains. \u201cA hundred and eight years later, there is still a relationship.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s it like to work together?\u201d I ask them.\u201cWell, I\u2019m very tough,\u201d Frank says. \u201cBut, I\u2019ve been really deferring more to Mark. You know, I ask him, do you want me here, or do you not want me here? I\u2019ve learned more from him than he has from me.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t see eye-to-eye on everything, of course,\u201d Mark says. \u201cOur manner or styles might be different, but it\u2019s not an issue. Money doesn\u2019t come between us or anything like that. We have never not talked.\u201d\u201cI defer to him, though,\u201d Frank says.One thing that probably won't change as Frank steps back from the restaurant: the sign.\nPhoto by Chris MottaliniMark has to get back to work, and Frank has an appointment with the bank. But first I have to eat. Frank convinces me to order the \u201cfilet and tail\u201d\u2014sliced steak with lobster tail, which is \u201con special,\u201d and pasta on the side, \u201cso I can try the Mama\u2019s Tomato Sauce.\u201d I do not fight this. The dish is better than it has to be, but it\u2019s also what I expected\u2014it\u2019s something very close to what my own Italian mom makes.What should a restaurant be, I wonder as I eat. It can give you new experiences and flavors, force you out of a rut. Or it can provide a sense of continuity in time and space and place. You walk in and know immediately where you are: the dark wood hues, the bottles of red table wine labeled with an image of an Italian grandma, the white linen tablecloth. It comes off as seamless, but there\u2019s a constant balancing act at work, a striving-forward that also recognizes the connections to the past.This is what grounds a restaurant, what makes it a place people return to over and over, to commemorate births and anniversaries and even deaths. \u201cI\u2019ve dealt with the same bank for over 50 years, the same food vendor for 50 years, the same wine vendor,\u201d Frank told me earlier. \u201cI\u2019ve been going to the same barber\u2014probably looks like it\u2014for 35 years. I\u2019m an old guy. I don\u2019t want to change, I\u2019m who I am. My son, he\u2019s always saying, adapt to what people want, and we gotta do this. But I said no, this is who we are. If you come, you know what to expect. I\u2019m gonna give you pizza or I\u2019m gonna give you chicken Parmesan, there\u2019s gonna be enough food to take home. And Mark realizes that too. We are who we are.\u201dMark had agreed, nodding along. \u201cHe loves where he is from. And now, so do I. I could have gone anywhere. I stayed home.\u201dJen Doll is a freelance journalist and the author of the young adult novel Unclaimed Baggage as well as the memoir Save the Date: The Occasional Mortifications of a Serial Wedding Guest.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsItalian AmericanRed SauceNew YorkRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
