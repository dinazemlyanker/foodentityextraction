I had to reserve that sour stalky weed a week in advance! Five-pound bags only! Okay! But rhubarb\u2014or as I pronounce it in the Princess Bride \u201cmawwiage\u201d voice, WOO-BAHBBB\u2014is something to get hyped about.Cakes, pies, galettes, brown butter jam bars! The weird wannabe-celery gets sweet and tangy when it\u2019s cooked, and maybe most importantly, retains its flashy pink color in a way purple asparagus wishes it could. Rhubarb is vanity.Which is why my favorite way to play with it is to make blushing pink rhubarb daiquiris, recipe courtesy of Lily Mirabelle Freedman. Her recipe requires making a rhubarb simple syrup and some light upper body work\u2014cocktail shaking. But that\u2019s never stopped me before.Me when rhubarb's in season.\nAfter I made the syrup, squeezed in some lemon juice, and let it cool, it was cocktail time. I stretched the definition of daiquiri to contain tequila as I was out of rum, and then I made one with gin for my mother-out-of-law, because, as she retells it, \u201cthe last time I had tequila I got arrested.\u201dBut please don\u2019t alert the professional cocktail people. Rum, tequila, vodka, moonshine, whatever! The combination of sweet-sour rhubarb, lime juice, and booze is fail proof. The fam loved it. \u201cWooobahb!\u201d we exclaimed as we clinked glasses. I regretted not making a double batch. Until next year.Make it:Rhubarb DaiquiriThis syrup isn\u2019t just for cocktails. Feel free to stir an ounce into club soda for easy drinking.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titRhubarbNever FailRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
