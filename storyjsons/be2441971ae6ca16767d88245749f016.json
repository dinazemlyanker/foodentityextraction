This recipe comes (fittingly) from her new cookbook, Lemon, Love & Olive Oil, which revisits dishes throughout Stone\u2019s life, especially ones she learned from her Greek grandmother. \u201cThe most important thing I\u2019ve learned from the women in my family is to cook with love, abandon, and an absence of fear,\u201d writes Stone. Traditionally, Greek olive oil cake uses orange juice and zest, but on a day she ran out of oranges, Stone substituted in lemons and the rest is history. Or, er, this recipe.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I decorated it with crushed pistachio, lemon rind and rose petalsIzzyHudson Valley 3/13/2022I absolutely loved this recipe. Followed the instructions to a T, but had to bake for 20 min longer (the cake was still jiggling a bit after 50 min). The end result was an incredibly rich, moist lemon pound cake-like cake that stores super well. The only change I would make next time is increasing the lemon juice and zest to 3 lemons, since I expected a stronger lemon flavour based on the title. AnonymousOttawa2/16/2022Has anyone tried this recipe using yogurt, instead of milk?Ann T. NJ1/31/2022I made this cake exactly per the recipe, but had to use a square pan since I didn't have a springform pan. Only after I stuck it in the oven did I bother to look at the comments and was immediately worried I had wasted time and ingredients on a bad recipe. Nonetheless, I was pleasantly surprised! I used a Wegmans EVOO and very fresh lemons, so the lemon flavor is excellent. I did have to bake it for 20 minutes longer than the recipe says as the middle will completely uncooked after 50 minutes. If I make this again, I will try the 1c of EVOO and 3 lemons variation suggested in the comments but all in all I'm happy with my result.JulianaArlington, VA1/30/2022I am usually not a desserts person, and I love this cake. It\u2019s not too sweet, and the lemon and olive oil are wonderful contrasts of bright and early. I usually use slightly less oil (1.25 cups) and replace the missing .25 liquid with lemon juice. I\u2019ve been making it with 1:1 gluten-free flour with fabulous results. Thanks, BA! Andrea Brooklyn, NY1/23/2022I wouldn't make this cake again. \n\nI listened to the guidance of the reviews and reduced the oil to one cup and upped it to three lemons. The texture was nicely dense and moist, but the flavor was strange. No issues with the cake being oily, likely because of the reduced amount of evoo, using room temp ingredients, and whisking well to ensure emulsion.\n\n I will say, I forgot to put in the the vanilla extract. Once I realized the omission, I referenced other recipes and found many don't include vanilla. To be on the safe side, I made a vanilla drizzle to put on top, which did negate the strange aftertaste a bit. \n\nOverall  I'd give it a Prue Leith, \"not worth the calories\".\n\nFor reference I made it with a single estate Palestinian olive oil.CassieMichigan1/23/2022I have generally found bon appetit's recipes to be reliable and good but in this case, I'm sorry to say I was sorely disappointed.\nIt took over an hour to bake and then it was crunchy around the sides and still mushy in the middle.\nWorse yet, it oozed oil from the bottom of the pan and when I ate a piece, it was disgustingly oily and \nsimply inedible. I ended up throwing the whole thing into the garbage.\nThe recipe is simple and I know how to bake, so I know I didn't make a mistake with it.\nWhat a waste of time and ingredients!\nVivianCanada1/14/2022Awesome soup!!! Gwen GleasonMilwaukee, WI1/13/2022Awful ! Wasted one and a half cups good olive oil it\u2019s so heaven and tastes way to oily Maryann KuehlIL1/10/2022Excellent recipe! I just made this with a beautiful extra virgin oil from Portugal, Bob\u2019s Red Mill 1to1 gluten free flour AND Oatly oat milk. It still (with all the weird substitutions for my weird sensitivities) came out incredibly DELICIOUS. More like a sumptuous pound cake/lemon bar. Will be in heavy rotation for me from here on out.GretchenBend, Or1/4/2022I absolutely loved it! It came out exactly as pictured.  I, like other reviewers, used 1 cup EVOO and juice of 3 large lemons. There is no oily taste and it's very lemony and fragrant.  It is not a chiffon or airy type of cake. Its dense, very moist, and will remind you more of a cheesecake... exactly as described and pictured.  Perhaps those with negative experiences were using cooking olive oil instead of rich, green EVOO? I was making this along with a couple other cakes for a holiday party so my springform pan was already in use. I used a regular 9\" round cake pan with parchment paper and it worked just as well. The cake doesn't rise much so it didn't overtop the pan while baking.  Guests loved it!Suzanne Charlotte NC 12/30/2021This is the best lemon cake I have ever had, so moist with a beautiful burst of lemon flavor perfect amount of sweetness! I roped mine with a homemade lemon glaze! \u2764\ufe0f This is my favorite recipe. Blake GMinnesota 12/29/2021Beautiful cake, made exactly as written. Important to whisk very well to emulsify oil, eggs, and sugar completely before moving on to next steps. Large, ripe lemons are also must. I ended up with about 3/4 cup juice and zest. Batter will be foamy and almost suspiciously thin, but trust the process. Final product is rich and delicious. Sara S.Philadelphia, PA12/22/2021Too much oil, very heavy, not at all the light, refreshing cake I was hoping for. I ended up throwing most of it away. Liz San Diego, CA12/22/2021I wanted to like this cake but it was just not very pleasant. For whatever reason, it wasn't quite lemony enough. I felt like perhaps there was too much olive oil in the cake. It was not as light or refreshing as I wanted it to be. I would have appreciated a nice glaze or something, too. Unfortunately, I ended up throwing most of it away in the trash can. AnonymousSan Diego, CA12/22/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titOlive OilLemonCitrusFruitCakeDessertRecipes you want to make.
