There are a lot of things to know about Carla, but one is that she has an encyclopedic library of cookbooks on hand for research.The purpose of this particular research? To create a recipe for White Pesto, a riff on the classic Genovese version we normally think of when we imagine pesto\u2014but just as delicious, craveable, and simple to make. Could she do it with the same number of ingredients? Using just a knife? What about without the heaping mound of herbs?! Would the internet throw themselves into a frenzy?! Well, folks. She did. And you can\u2019t, because her recipe is delicious, and it\u2019s as much of a pesto as the green sauce we know and love.The result is an ultra-creamy, walnut-studded sauce that can be made in no time\u2014well, as long as it takes to boil water, pretty much\u2014and all in one bowl.The creaminess comes from the base of ricotta, which Carla chose because it\u2019s so mild. \u201cYou can add a lot of it without it becoming super salty or super funky,\u201d she says. \u201cPlus, it has a high water content, which helps make a sauce that really coats the noodles.\u201d There\u2019s still parm in there to hit that salty note, there\u2019s still raw garlic for that bite, and there\u2019s olive oil, salt, and pepper, because duh. Toasted walnuts fill the need for fatty nuttiness. But the real twist comes from lemon zest. \u201cWe tasted the first iteration with no lemon,\u201d says Carla, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t quite dynamic enough. Without tons of herbs, we needed something bright to balance the dish out.\u201d The main difference is in the proportions: Heavy on the cheese and nuts, light on the herbs (though there is a small amount of oregano in there\u2014just enough to lend an earthy bite in the background, but not enough to give off any color). So far so good, right?It gets better: All you have to do is give those ingredients a couple quick chops and a few grates, and mix it all together in a bowl. See that? That\u2019s your water boiling already. Then, throw in the pasta, cook it to al dente, scoop out a cup of the pasta water, pour that directly into the bowl, add the pasta, and toss it vigorously. \u201cThe tossing, tossing, tossing is important,\u201d says Carla. \u201cI mean it when I say a full two minutes.\u201d It will feel like a long time, but you need to commit in order to make the sauce thicken up and cling to each noodle.And really, what\u2019s two minutes when your dinner just came together in less than thirty?Get the recipe:White Pesto PastaBuilt of toasted nuts, creamy ricotta, and salty Parmesan, you don\u2019t even need a food processor to make this riff on the normal pesto you know and love.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPestoWeeknightPastaRead MorecookingBA\u2019s Best Pesto Recipe Is Here and It's the Perfect Balance of Nuts, Herbs, and CheeseBy Alex Beggs and Andy BaraghanicookingHow to Make Pesto Out of Just About AnythingBy Amiel StanekRecipes you want to make.
