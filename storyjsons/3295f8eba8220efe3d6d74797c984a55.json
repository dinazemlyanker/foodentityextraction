Shoulders to the ear lobes, sigh. There\u2019s some new dried pasta, and it\u2019s better than the old dried pasta. Some snacks are coated in chocolate simply because they can be. Incredisauce joins the overconfident condiment club\u2014see last year\u2019s Magnifisauce for reference. A bag of frozen beet and parsnip \u201cfries\u201d? Shrug-a-shrug-shrug. It\u2019s a weird and dreary time of year. The time of year when a microwaved cheeseburger burrito comforts your deep winter malaise and sends you into a nap that carries you to spring. Hopefully. Now, let\u2019s see what else is new this month.Wow, New PastaOrganic Fusilli Corti Bucati PastaTight and springy little Slinkies.Organic Pappardelle Pasta NestsLoose and silky flowing ribbons.Chocolate-Coated Things (Because They Can)Dark Chocolate Almond Butter Filled Pretzel NuggetsThe chocolate layer is so thick you barely get any pretzel crunch, let alone salt. I\u2019m here for both of those! Well, not anymore.Peanut Butter Cocoa MarshmallowsWhy did I taste sesame? Something\u2019s afoot. A dense marshmallow is a thing a marshmallow should never be. That, or a lawyer. Marshmallows should stick to what they know, though they stick to everything, so my argument is moot. This one just didn\u2019t work out, okay?Bamba Puffed Peanut & Corn SnacksDelicate, airy corn Bamba dipped in thick dark chocolate. The corn dissolves and you\u2019re left eating a slab of bitter dark chocolate. Didn\u2019t like these, but my toddler nieces did. Leah\u2019s review: \u201cThey\u2019re yummy \u2019cause they have chocolate on the bottom.\u201d Okay, kiddo.Dark Chocolate Strawberry BarThis is a beautiful thin bar of dark chocolate with strawberry speckles that I\u2019d wear on a tube top for Mardi Gras. When you crack off a section, a strawberry syrup oozes out. It\u2019s a sticky situation, but then again, so is getting out of a tube top, and that\u2019s always worth it, isn\u2019t it?A Single Frozen ItemRoot Vegetable FriesIf you\u2019re craving french fries and buy these out of self-hatred or guilt, they\u2019re never going to satisfy. They air-fry up nice but get soggy quickly, especially the watery beets. I liked them with the honey-mustard newcomer \u201cIncredisauce,\u201d while my partner ate one and refused another bite. Up to you!Condiments and SalsaIncredisauceI prefer this to the runny Magnifisauce, which is burger special sauce missing something, uh, special. Incredisauce is honey mustard, and it\u2019s just great. Tune in next month for my review of Wonderfsauce, which is a tube of mayonnaise.Organic Date SyrupA molasses-deep syrup you can do whatever you usually do with sweet syrups, like add it to overnight oats or forget it in the back of the pantry. I\u2019ll tell you what I do with it: I keep making smoothies with spinach but I\u2019ll put in too much spinach\u2014you know it\u2019s too much if you taste it\u2014so I squeeze in some date syrup to restore balance. Also good for: the glaze on these brussels!Guajillo SalsaGuajillo has a rich, smoky and near-chocolaty flavor\u2014yum. This salsa was a bit one-note for me, though you should never trust anyone who declares a food \u201ca bit one-note.\u201d What I mean is, it\u2019s good as a salsa on tacos or on a rice-and-beans bowl, but it\u2019s not dynamic enough to star in the chips \u2019n\u2019 salsa show.Those Artichokes in a PouchMarinated Artichokes on the GoI loved these. They make every salad feel like it came from a fast-casual salad chain backed by venture capital. The marinade is mild, which I like because that means it doesn\u2019t clash with my ranch. But does anything?Cheese and Not-CheeseBoursin Vegan Cream CheeseYES. Vegan cream cheese, mostly coconut oil and other emulsifiers, can have a problem being spreadable and dippable. Here, it\u2019s both. And best of all, the Boursin flavor comes through\u2014garlic, chives, an allium bite. I ate the whole tub with Mary\u2019s Gone Crackers, the superior cracker (not sold at Trader Joe\u2019s), and considered buying a beret. Eating Boursin always makes me feel that way.Spicy Buffalo CheddarSpicy! This cheese was made for nachos. Buffalo is good branding, but I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s so Buffalo \u2019bout it, other than the red color and generic heat. Buffalo = Frank\u2019s Red Hot to me; maybe chicken is involved. But whatever, that\u2019s semantics! Enjoy the cheese. Chase it with some Pepto, show your body who\u2019s boss.Neufchatel Soft-Ripened CheeseA Valentine\u2019s Day\u2013timed, heart-shaped creamy cheese with some farmhouse funk and lactic tang and in need of honey. Rind as chewy as jerky. Doubt this\u2019ll be on shelves year-round. You didn\u2019t miss much.Meaty ThingsCheeseburger BurritoBeefy, cheesy, a little dried out at the edges of the tortilla from the nuclear power of the microwave. But it\u2019s still a cheeseburger burrito! Let it soothe you.Teriyaki Marinated Skirt SteakThis was like $21, which is $$$ at Trader Joe\u2019s. The marinade was safe. A little sweet, mostly soy, and barely noticeable. A squeeze of lime helps. I doused my tacos in Sriracha. (A promotional side note: Sometimes when I want an easy sweet soy sauce glaze for grilled fish/meats, I make the one from Chris Morocco\u2019s sushi rice and salmon recipe\u2014it goes well on everything and comes together in seconds.) Next time I\u2019ll make my own marinade.Seasonal Mousse Cakes!Raspberry Mousse CakesThese petits fours make me feel like a pretty, pretty princess, and I eat them in two scarfing bites. They\u2019re so pink and cute. They\u2019re reminiscent of my first favorite body wash, sun-ripened raspberry, a product I used to the point of revulsion\u2014the scent of it would make me dry-heave today. But not these! They\u2019re vanilla cake topped with fluffy mousse, contained by thin sturdy frosting. The loopy little green leaves are a reminder that before they were cooked into jam, enhanced with sugar, extracted into a flavor, and preserved with citric acid, some ingredients in this treat came from nature.Vegetal MomentsCold Pressed Cucumber Avocado SmoothieThick and viscous, like drinking gloopy green goddess dressing. Specks of hairy ginger swim between my teeth. Spinach flecks tickle the throat. Couldn\u2019t finish.Ready VeggieA grab bag of snow peas, broccoli, dried-out carrot coins, and brussels sprout shreds ready for saut\u00e9ing, although the brussels shavings will brown and burn before anything else is cooked. But you wanted variety! I loved this mix for changing up my dinner routine.Cauliflower of Many ColorsPrechopped and ready to roast, easy. Don\u2019t let them linger in the fridge for too many days or the sulfuric aroma compounds will unleash the moment you open the bag. PHEW!Kohlrabi Vegetable PastaKohlrabi has a nice crisp texture, I don\u2019t need it to be anything other than itself. Don\u2019t make this into pasta\u2014fry it up with rice, other veg for texture, or ground meat. Also a great source of vitamin C, in case you were looking for one. Try it in this recipe, in which you cook it with bacon and scallions.Winter Frost PineberriesThese are spooky Nightwalker strawberries that are supposed to taste like pineapple and blind naivete, maybe. They tasted mostly like strawberries and water with a subtle tropical note. I do love a status fruit though! Try it!Another Muffin MixBlueberry Muffin MixYou rehydrate a bag of blueberries to make these, which was like a little science experiment or the closest I\u2019ll get to eating bunker food. I doctored the mix by adding toasted slivered almonds and sour cream, but they\u2019re still not as good as these spelt blueberry muffins, my end-all, be-all blueberry muffin. The nutty whole wheat flour (and buttery crumble!) is such a great match with the sweet berries. Try those instead!Explore Bon App\u00e9titTrader Joe'sRecipes you want to make.
