The only day a sexy cauliflower pizza might show up on your doorstep.By Alex BeggsOctober 31, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Johanna WalderdorffFacebookTwitterEmailHave you ever caught a glimpse of a pineapple from a certain angle and felt something? I mean in your private parts. Ever been turned on by a greasy, hot carton of spicy chicken nuggs? Is sexy food something we\u2019re all thinking but not talking about? OBVIOUSLY. Because Halloween slinks around every year and we\u2019re forced to face our deepest subconscious sexual desires: wanting to bang food. Pineapples, spiked seltzer, vegan hamburgers\u2014nothing is safe from the horny manufacturers of rayon, landfill-bound sexy costumes. Since I\u2019m happily admitting to this seasonal fetish, I\u2019m going to take the liberty (sexy lady liberty costume right this way) of ranking a few food costumes by sexiness, on a scale from 1 [JUST FRIENDS] to 5 [DO ME NOW]. And we\u2019re ranking costumes, not the nice models wearing them, who are equally sexy in the eyes of the lord.Photo Courtesy Tipsy Elves / John Morris PhotographySexy Pineapple, $45 on AmazonI can\u2019t believe they muted the pineapple\u2019s sexiest feature\u2014those S&M spiky scales\u2014and turned him into a minidress sweatshirt. Zippered, no less! (Everyone knows the sexiest fabric holder is a snap, like on tearaway pants.) This might make you sweat, but only because of the highly reactive polyester. In fact, I would keep that green topper away from any open flames, that\u2019s a human tiki torch waiting to happen. This whole getup is way too flammable to get me going.Sexy ranking: 1Photo courtesy Yandy.comSexy Beyond Burger, $50 from YandyThe idea of sinking my teeth into some pea protein soaked in spices and canola oil\u2014wheph!\u2014talk about hot and bothered. What else is a bother? That \u201cplant-based\u201d head flag that pokes right into your cranium like a toothpick lobotomy. This is a veryyyy sexy costume, what with the saving-the-planet undertones and polka-dot sesame seeds and all, though I notice the \u201cbun\u201d sections seem disproportionate to the \u201cyummiest artificial patty\u201d part. Like any fake burger, there\u2019s always going to be a little letdown.Sexy ranking: 3Photo courtesy Yandy.comSexy Cauliflower Pizza, $80 from YandyThe suggestive shape of those mushrooms, the devious winking tomatoes, the fact that the V of the pizza slice lines up with a V of one\u2019s own, well, that\u2019s sex with a capital S. Not to mention we\u2019re not going to be bloated from pizza crust carbs, no sir, not with CAULI CRUST. Can\u2019t roll over and claim a \u201cpizza baby\u201d is keeping you from getting it on tonight. (We will be gassy, though, but that\u2019s never stopped me before.)Sexy rating: 4Courtesy HalloweenCostumes.comSexy Ros\u00e9 Bottle, $45 from HalloweenCostumes.comThe font.Sexy rating: 1Courtesy HalloweenCostumes.comSexy Fried Egg, $25 from halloweencostumes.comSpit, spat, sputter! The sound of an egg frying in hot hot oil is as seductive as Marvin Gaye. Crispy edges, gushing yolk, fat flakes of salt and our more-than-friend pepper\u2014get in my bed, fried egg! Not sure why this one is so shadowy-gray (old egg?), or if the leggings are supposed to imply a cast iron pan, but let\u2019s not ask too many questions. It\u2019s Halloween. Let sexy reign.Sexy rating: 4Explore Bon App\u00e9titHalloweenRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
