He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.I like to think that Jess Shadbolt and Clare de Boer cook just like me. But, you know, better.They see what looks good at the market, they\u2019re not shy with the olive oil and butter, they toss in some fresh herbs, and they always keep the salt pig within arm\u2019s reach.The menu at King, their small, understated Italian-ish restaurant in New York\u2019s West Village, never wanders\u2014there\u2019s a handful of appetizers and entrees and a dessert or two. It\u2019s the kind of place where you can be all posh without feeling extravagant.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Photo by Adam RapoportMy wife and I ended up there this past weekend for a long, lazy lunch. (Meanwhile, can we talk about how Sunday lunch rules over Saturday dinner?)Asparagus is everywhere at the farmer\u2019s markets in the northeast these days, so Jess and Clare layered some poached spears beneath a tangle of mixed bitter greens and shaved, sharp cheese. They threw in a bunch of hand-shelled favas, too, because they\u2019re fancy like that.Photo by Adam RapoportAs a home cook, if you\u2019re not buying asparagus right now, you\u2019re doing something wrong. Snap off the woody ends, then grill it with some olive oil and salt, or blanch it quickly in well-salted water and serve immediately. Or plunge it an ice bath to preserve its bright green color and incorporate it into a salad, or hit it with a bunch of lemon juice, some olive oil, and Maldon.To go with the salad, Simone ordered the handmade ricotta ravioli with sage butter\u2014one of those wonderfully simple dishes that I\u2019m never going to make myself. Just saying!Photo by Adam RapoportWe split the pan-roasted chicken thighs, which might as well be the national dish of Bon App\u00e9tit. Season the thighs well (or brine them, if you\u2019re a restaurant chef), start them skin side down until the skin renders its fat and gets crispy. Flip, and then slide them into a 400\u00b0 oven until done. Oh, and layer the pan with all sorts of other good stuff that you want to luxuriate in that glorious chicken fat, from spring peas to potatoes to leeks, you name it. Again, Jess and Clare\u2019s take tasted better than any version I\u2019ve made, but not so much better that I couldn\u2019t relate.Finally, there was a trio of homemade ice creams for dessert. Another thing I could make if I wanted to but...probably never will. Hence, King.Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works. Restaurant recommendations you trust.FacebookTwitterPinterestInstagramYouTubeMore from Bon App\u00e9titMastheadNewsletter SignupBon App\u00e9tit Media KitContactSubscription FAQsCareersRSS FeedsSite MapAccessibility HelpCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCond\u00e9 Nast SpotlightDo Not Sell My Personal Info\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
