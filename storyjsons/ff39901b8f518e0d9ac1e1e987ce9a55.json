Get familiar with her through her curated playlist, Nice 2 Meet You. First up, a conversation with actor Kelvin Harrison Jr.These days Kelvin Harrison Jr. is focused on the things that nourish him\u2014creative projects that foster growth, connections that welcome his authentic self, and crafting a self-care routine, which includes journaling and attending therapy\u2014that help him continue evolving into the best version of himself. I\u2019ve been curious about the New Orleans\u2013raised actor ever since watching him shape-shift in different roles: the Muslim teen love interest Tahir in Nijla Mu\u2019min\u2019s coming-of-age story Jinn; a former Eritrean child soldier plopped into white suburbia via adoption with a whole lot brewing beneath the surface in Luce; the popular athlete drowning in expectations of Black excellence and toxic masculinity in Waves; and most recently, a charming aspiring musician who flexes his singing chops on smooth Rodney Jerkins\u2013assisted tracks in The High Note (streaming Aug. 11).Kelvin\u2019s work is fueled by a desire to help push the culture forward through art that sparks meaningful dialogues, and that works in service of building a freer, less-oppressive world. The next stage of his career is on the horizon: Catch him next in season 2 of HBO\u2019s Euphoria and as Fred Hampton in Aaron Sorkin\u2019s upcoming The Trial of the Chicago 7.Below, I chat with Kelvin about playing an adult with a healthy sense of self in The High Note, the trauma that often accompanies growing up as one of the only Black children in the room, and what he\u2019s been cooking up during quarantine.Hi Kelvin! How are you holding up in quarantine?Kelvin: I\u2019m good. Ya know, ups and downs, but mostly good. I\u2019m just taking it day by day. I just finished my workout and that\u2019s always nice. My trainer\u2019s back this week. He took a week off and I was, like, shaming him for taking time off. Like, you\u2019ve left me alone.Let\u2019s get into your latest film project, The High Note. You finally got to play a grown man with this character David, a budding musician. And he seemed to be in a way better emotional state than a lot of your past characters, like Luce, or Tyler in Waves. How was playing that role?Kelvin: It was refreshing. I keep saying this, but after I did Waves I was exhausted. It did take an emotional and mental toll on me. When we do these jobs, sometimes we open up a lot of ourselves and put it on the table, but then you have to unpack that. You can do it through a character within the realm of that safe space, but then there\u2019s this residue of emotions that you kind of have to figure out in order to get back to your normal life. So I started going to therapy and stuff like that. I was looking for a fun movie that was uplifting and full of joy, and about happy, healthy love, and people that were in their worth, and trying to find their confidence and actively pursuing a balanced lifestyle. I think that made doing this movie so much more fun. Working on [The High Note\u2019s] set brought me a lot of joy last summer.What have your 20s been like so far? I feel like a huge part of this time involves learning how to treat yourself better, and beginning to understand the meaning of self-love and the work, especially the healing work, that goes into it.Kelvin: It\u2019s been a lot of reprogramming of what I thought I knew and who I thought I was supposed to be, and trying to get to a place where I\u2019m really content with all of the things I\u2019ve worked towards. And understanding that I\u2019ve been actively doing the work of trying to find my most authentic self and inviting people into my space who complement that. I think it\u2019s just standing in that space instead of trying to run away from it or trying to run past it. I think I did a lot of that for a long time, saying, If I pretend I\u2019m there, then maybe I\u2019ll get there faster. But now I\u2019m like, what\u2019s the rush? I\u2019ve been comfortable with the day to day.What\u2019s something 26-year-old Kelvin has in his self-care toolbox that 18-year-old Kelvin definitely didn\u2019t?Kelvin: I\u2019ve learned there are certain things that I love that do feed me and nurture my spiritual growth. It\u2019s six things: art, food, music, family, friends, and working out. Those are things and people I love, and that I need in my life. I used to feel like I needed to people please, and do all the things for everyone and be many different people, but it was taking my joy away from me and ultimately, I wasn\u2019t performing to the best of my ability. Constantly feeling like I wasn\u2019t enough or wasn\u2019t doing enough messed with my psyche. Now I only do what I have to do and things that bring me joy. If it starts to interrupt my peace I\u2019m out.Yeah, that\u2019s so crucial. When you mentioned feeling obligated to please people and performing different versions of yourself that people wanted you to be, that reminded me so much of certain themes in Luce and Waves. I feel like there is a very specific trauma that Black kids who grow up in white suburbia or who attend private schools that are predominately white/non-Black endure, that often isn\u2019t even fully recognized as trauma until looking back, like, woah, that was actually a really fucked-up experience. Do you relate to that?Totally. I went to a private school where I was one of maybe five, at most 10, Black kids in my high school. I stepped into that space and I suddenly felt like I needed to match them, instead of trying to maintain my individuality and understanding how special that was. Especially when you\u2019re a young person, it\u2019s all about trying to fit in. You assimilate to whatever culture is being set, whatever the majority is doing. Fundamentally, it just doesn\u2019t add up. Everyone\u2019s experiences are different. The world we live in is different, and we have to respect and understand that, but I was denying my own reality.Those experiences kind of played into the reason why Luce was so interesting to me. The idea of this young person having the awakening that I never had, and also finding agency and power, and his intelligence, and his experiences, and his voice, and his ability to seem like he is a part of their group. Really [my character\u2019s actions in] Luce, even Waves, are all the things I didn\u2019t do or maybe didn\u2019t really understand, and [I\u2019m] kind of allowing these kids to handle it in a way I wish I could\u2019ve. Well, not necessarily Tyler\u2026Right, but even Tyler\u2014while watching Waves and even after processing his journey after the film\u2014I was like, but he didn\u2019t get the tools and support he needed! There was so much pain he was absorbing alone and didn\u2019t know how to process.Kelvin: Yeah, it\u2019s so tricky too \u2019cause, you know, I think parents in general of that generation saw their own parents who survived so much while also still dealing with segregation and just racism on a daily basis. I\u2019m actually thinking of my parents being from the South, that\u2019s also kind of how Trey [Edward Shults] and I thought about it. With Tyler\u2019s parents being from South Florida, it\u2019s a different vibe. They\u2019ve been taught to withstand the trauma instead of learning how to end it and communicating that to their children. Tyler is constantly trying to get through the day and just get by. Like, ignore it, figure it out, deal with it as much as you can. But he\u2019s always apologizing, always remorseful, and shameful about who he is. It\u2019s not knowing how to use the shame and shape it into a person who\u2019s confident and in their worth. It\u2019s a person who\u2019s allowed the shame to take over them to a place where it\u2019s made them feel so low. He shrinks himself daily.Whew, yes. On navigating anti-Blackness, how have you been able to rest and recharge while dealing with the uprisings following the George Floyd murder and the many other deaths of Black people that flood the news and social media?Oh, man. The first few weeks of it all, it was really important for me to get off of social media. My friends and I were trying to figure out what truly can we do? What is our place in this moment? How are we most effective? It was a lot of meditation and also a lot of reading. I\u2019m trying to look to the elders, and also to people who\u2019ve maybe had similar experiences of what the protests looked like during the Civil Rights movement, and just trying to find the words to understand. Also trying to find a space where we can still love each other and show love, but communicate in a way that\u2019s actually effective. Once again, I had to challenge myself to figure out what\u2019s my intent, what do I want, and how do I go about getting that, and what\u2019s the most effective way of going about getting that? I think I needed to remove my fear and my anger, and put myself in a position where I was listening more, then applying that to the spaces where I had power. It became more about asking myself, what do I do with my team and the work that I do?On a much lighter note, you mentioned earlier you love food. Have you been doing any cooking during quarantine?I made like a black miso cod. I was doing garlic potatoes. Carbonaras. I made a lot of salmon; that\u2019s basic, though.I love salmon. What kind do you make\u2014like soy sauce salmon, lemony salmon?Kelvin: Lemony salmon, love that. Sometimes I did a soy salmon. I do a lot of garlic stuff. I was trying to figure out a lot of recipes with garlic because everyone was like, \u201cgarlic is good for the immune system.\u201d (Laughs)Oh, I haven\u2019t heard that!Kelvin: I was like, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but we\u2019re garlicked up today. We\u2019re gonna figure it all out. I do chicken parm sometimes. Garlicky spinach. And then I did some soul food days, like mac \u2018n\u2019 cheese, greens. I did some brisket, had that going for a second. I made my own doughnut recipe...that was bad.Ohhh, soul food sounds so good! Is there anything in particular you crave out here that\u2019s hard to find that makes you homesick?Kelvin: Ooh, my mom just sent me all the things I needed to make gumbo. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m about to do this week, make some gumbo. I\u2019m from New Orleans\u2014I miss it. I miss crab. I\u2019m so excited.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishCelebritiesHere We AreInterviewsRead MorecultureWhy Indie Rapper Junglepussy Wrote a Song About Trader Joe'sBy Martine ThompsonRecipes you want to make.
