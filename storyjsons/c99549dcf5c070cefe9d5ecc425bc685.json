I really enjoy making chutney sandwiches, which is two pieces of bread, a slice of american cheese, hot lays, and the chutney of course. Highly recommend! ( if you have a mouth for hot foods \ud83d\ude09)AnonymousFort Wayne Indiana10/17/2020Such a great use of past-its-prime cilantro. It was spectacular, although I did substitute red pepper flakes for the chile (pandemic and all). It was perfect on eggs, sandwiches and roast chicken. Can't wait to make a second batch.  gabriel.iglesias205Miami, FL4/16/2020SO GOOD! Bright and zingy and not too too spicy (we used serrano peppers). I had to use a little more lime juice than recommended but I may have an overly large bunch of cilantro. Definitely give this a try and put it on EVERYTHING.
