If you sign up for our newsletter, you\u2019ll get her letter before everyone else.Hi everyone,Like many of you, I\u2019m horrified by the rising and persistent attacks on Asians and Asian Americans in this country. It\u2019s haunting to hear about this happening across the U.S., and I\u2019ve been reading most everything I can get my hands on, trying to figure out what I can do.It\u2019s easy\u2014and not wrong\u2014to say that familiarizing ourselves with the wide diversity of \u201cAsian foods\u201d is helpful, that education can go a long way toward broadening our collective understanding of the different communities and cultures that make up America, and that food is a good entry point into that. In the grid below I\u2019m highlighting some recipes and essays that showcase the vast range of ingredients, techniques, and traditions associated with Lunar New Year, which this year was fraught with fear and anxiety as it lined up with the increased number of attacks on Asian Americans. While the holiday has passed, the stories and recipes are evergreen.But as we all know, using food as a way to talk about what\u2019s going on in the world around us isn\u2019t enough. What\u2019s happening in Chinatowns and elsewhere across the U.S. and in Chinese, East, and Southeast Asian restaurants is about much more than what we choose to eat. \u201cAmericans may love Chinese food,\u201d Jenny Zhang writes on Eater, \u201cbut they don\u2019t love the people who make it.\u201d She goes on: \u201cThey treat Chinatowns like their playgrounds, their residents like backdrops for photos. They reach for the products of Chinese labor and with the same hands knock them down on the street.\u201dI\u2019ve asked so many people what they are doing to help, and the answer I\u2019ve heard the most is to put money into and empower community organizations. Restaurateur Eric Sze, part of the newly formed #EnoughIsEnough initiative in New York City, tells Vice that the group formed because they\u2019re \u201ctrying to focus on empowering people and showing people that the small guy counts too.\u201d Today I\u2019m donating to the new AAPI Community Fund, in partnership with Go Fund Me, which my colleague and Allure editor in chief Michelle Lee tells me will donate funds to \u201ca group of fully vetted community organizations working to #StopAsianHate.\u201d And Joey Hernandez, BA\u2019s research director, shared four additional resources below, with some vetting by the Asian American Journalists Association.Stand Against Hatred, an incident reporting center created by Asian Americans Advancing Justice, a national affiliation advocating for the civil and human rights of Asian Americans and other underserved communitiesStop AAPI Hate, an incident reporting center managed by the Asian Pacific Planning and Policy Council, Chinese for Affirmative Action, and the Asian American Studies Department of San Francisco State UniversityThe Asian and Pacific Islander American Health Forum\u2019s Community Care Package, a weekly newsletter with mental health and counseling resources, Covid-19 updates in a number of languages, and stories from various communities meant to inspireNational Asian American Pacific Islander Mental Health Association\u2019s directory of mental health service providers for Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders organized by stateA few additional links:Resources to support Asian Americans in NYCAAPI Anti-Hate Community Resources50 ways to donate in support of Asian communitiesAsian Americans Advancing JusticeI\u2019d love to learn from you, especially if you\u2019re doing something to #StopAsianHate in your community.
