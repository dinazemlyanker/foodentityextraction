Or there\u2019s that slice of $8 cake you buy to assuage the Sunday scaries. I support you. Because sometimes I buy $14 peanut butter.But it\u2019s not just any peanut butter. It\u2019s Big Spoon Roasters\u2019 Chai Spice peanut butter, which is a heavenly mixture of peanuts, almonds, cardamom, sugar, honey, clove, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, vanilla, and Jacobsen sea salt. It evokes the same flavor profile as chai tea, and has lots of small crunchy bits that remind me of biting into a good, aged Parmesan.

Or, as part of a brunch spread when you\u2019re hosting guests, but only guests that you extra-special like or need to really cement a friendship with.So yeah, Big Spoon Roasters.
