Yes, ReallyGrab a stool and dig in at the Grey Market, where southern diner meets New York deli.By Hilary CadiganApril 30, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto Courtesy of The Grey MarketFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.One of my dad\u2019s favorite sayings when he\u2019s feeling emotionally ignored is, \u201cWhat am I, chopped liver?\u201d As in, \u201cWhat am I, the thing nobody wants?\u201d Liver rarely gets a day in the sun, unless it\u2019s mousse-ified or cooked down into pate, which usually means its somewhat metallic (okay, blood-like) flavor gets buried beneath a healthy dose of herbs, wine, butter, or all three. Chopped liver, on the other hand, is often a harder sell. Especially in the South, where Jewish delis\u2014some of the best places to find the stuff\u2014are few and far between. So, imagine my surprise (and delight; did I mention I love liver?) when I walked into chef Mashama Bailey\u2019s newest Savannah restaurant to find a chopped liver sammie on the menu front and center.The Grey Market is an extension of The Grey, Bailey\u2019s first restaurant, which is located in a dolled-up former Greyhound station just down the street. There, chef created a very-adorable-but-not-to-the-point-of-being-saccharine market/eatery that falls somewhere between New York deli and southern diner, making good on both her NYC roots and Georgia heritage in one spot. You can buy Sour Patch Kids and non-organic dish soap and good wine and local butter, and then you can sit on a cushy diner stool, sip egg creams, and nosh on a perfectly executed chopped liver on rye with a side of crunchy pickle.So, yes, dad, you are chopped liver. And that\u2019s a compliment.Go There: The Grey MarketExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsSavannahRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
