When I was a child, she taught me how to make her caramel pound cake, and throughout the years I\u2019ve adapted it numerous times to make it my own. This version is bright, sweet, and a little floral thanks to lots of lemon, elderflower liqueur, and roasted strawberries\u2014a more delicious preparation of the out-of-season berries that are a Valentine\u2019s Day staple. \u2014Danielle Bell, recipe developer and cofounder of de Porres Dinner SeriesAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

St-Germain (elderflower liqueur)\u00bdtsp. vanilla extractPreparationStrawberriesStep 1Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 250\u00b0. Place strawberries in an 8x8\" baking dish and toss with sugar and St-Germain. Roast, stirring every hour or so, until juicy and tender, 2\u00bd\u20133 hours. Let cool.Do Ahead: Strawberries can be roasted 1 week ahead. Transfer to an airtight container; cover and chill. Reheat in a small saucepan if desired.CakeStep 2Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 325\u00b0. Butter and flour a 6-cup Bundt pan or 9x5\" loaf pan. Whisk baking powder, salt, and 1\u00bd cups flour in a medium bowl.Step 3Using an electric mixer, beat eggs, sugar, St-Germain, lemon zest, vanilla, and \u00be cup butter in a large bowl on medium-low speed until smooth and combined (use the paddle attachment if using a stand mixer), about 2 minutes (the mixture will look broken and that\u2019s okay). Reduce speed to low and gradually beat in dry ingredients, \u00bc cup at a time, scraping down the sides of bowl as needed, until combined. Increase speed to medium and beat in cream until incorporated.Step 4Scrape batter into prepared pan and smooth surface. Bake until golden brown and a tester comes out clean or with just a few crumbs, 40\u201345 minutes if using Bundt pan or 50\u201360 if using loaf pan. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool in pan 20 minutes.Glaze and AssemblyStep 5While the cake cools, cook butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, swirling often, until butter foams, then browns (do not burn) and smells nutty, 6\u20138 minutes. Add sugar and cook, whisking constantly, until dissolved, about 1 minute. Whisk in lemon juice and salt; cook, swirling occasionally, until mixture is reduced slightly, about 5 minutes. Add St-Germain and vanilla and cook, swirling often, until glaze is syrupy, about 2 minutes.Step 6Turn out cake onto a plate (flip cake upright if using a loaf pan). Poke holes all over cake with tester; spoon glaze over warm cake. Cut cake into slices and serve topped with roasted strawberries and their juices.How would you rate Lemon-Elderflower Pound Cake?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (5)Back to TopTriangleI'm just starting to mix ingredients and I too have found that the heavy cream is no where to be added???????  This does not inspire me.  Especially since the reviews have indicated this.  Is no one at Bon Appetit reading reviews?D M SahaidachnyHicksville, NY USA3/20/2022I enjoyed this recipe, but I did make a couple of tweaks because I prepared it for a dinner party.  I halved the recipe and cooked the cake batter in ramekins to allow for easier and cuter plating.  Per some other reviews, I added some extra lemon zest so that the cake's lemony flavor came through more.  I didn't taste much of the elderflower.  Regarding the strawberries, they didn't produce that much syrup, so I added the roasted strawberry to the glaze while it was reducing and some extra elderflower liqueur, which really brought the flavors together.  Altogether, it was good!  AVBGLIC, NY1/30/2022Will this batter rise when baked? I'm using a smaller loaf pan. It fits 6 cups of water but I'm thinking I might put some of the batter into cupcake pans just in case. Nicole DBrooklyn  NY 1/24/2022The cream goes in at step 3.Anonymous1/20/2022Hi Bon Appetit, first of all thank you so much for making all these great recipes available to us all. I use many of them happily and with great success. However, this one is not one of them!\n- you forgot to let us know when to add the cream. I added it to the wet ingredients but the explanation seems to indicate to add it after everything else is combined. Not sure it made a difference though.\n- I think it is brilliant to use St Germain but you can't really taste it. \n- It needs a lot more lemon zest than what is called for. The cake is faintly lemony but not enough. I would increase the zest to a tablespoon - or perhaps increase both zest and St Germain by 1/3?\n- it takes a lot longer for 6 tbl of sugar to melt than 1 minute. In fact, the glaze took a very long time to make for what it was. I would not bother with butter and all that, just use lemon juice, maybe St Germain and sugar (and less of it)\nAll in all, it is a pleasant cake but there are recipes that are quicker, less fattening and gives more lemon bang for one's baking buck. \n- Susanne in TorontoToronto ON Canada1/9/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titDessertFruit DessertBakingCakeLoaf CakeStrawberryBerryFruitSt-GermainAlcohol & Other DrinksLemonCitrusWinterNut-FreeRecipes you want to make.
