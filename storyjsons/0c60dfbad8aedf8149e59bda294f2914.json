He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.How to master frittata for a crowdMan, I had a carby Sunday.It all started with brunch. We invited our friends Pac and Katherine over, along with their kids, Frankie and Mary Rives.I bought a dozen bagels. Simone suggested a frittata. And I thought, sure, no problem. Crack some eggs, saut\u00e9 some of this and that, throw it in a pan. How hard could it be?Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!But not until I called up this veritable frittata treatise did I realize that I actually had no clue what I was doing. Like, did you know your frittata needs dairy? Well, it does. Whether it\u2019s heavy cream, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, or sour cream, you want \u00bd cup for a dozen eggs.And what temperature do you set your oven to? 350\u00b0, thank you very much. And it\u2019s always better to slightly undercook by a smidge, rather than overcook. You want a tender frittata, not a rubbery one. So, for 12 eggs, start checking at no more than 15 minutes. If the frittata is no longer wobbly, it\u2019s done!And did you even consider what size pan you\u2019re going to use? I mean, come on! (Hint: Always one size smaller of a non-stick pan than you think. Better a thick frittata than a flat one.)So I ended up caramelizing a mess of onions and saut\u00e9eing a big bag of spinach with garlic. Into the pan this all went with a handful of grated Parm, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, and 15 beaten eggs. And, man, did it turn out well!I should\u2019ve built my plate around the frittata and a simple green salad I made, but of course I couldn\u2019t resist multiple toasted bagels\u2014with butter and cream cheese. I know, I\u2019m crazy like that. And to round things out, Katherine showed up with a just-baked banana bread, because you can\u2019t come empty-handed, right?Once everyone cleared out, I escaped to the gym because I had an unusually booked Sunday evening. Normally, I like to stay in. But Fabi\u00e1n von Hauske and Jeremiah Stone, chef-owners of Hot 10 winner Wildair and Contra, were celebrating the release of their new book, A Very Serious Cookbook\u2019 at Una Pizza Napoletana, which they also run. I couldn\u2019t not go, and I couldn\u2019t not indulge in some natural wine and Anthony Mangieri\u2019s renowned, pillowy soft Neapolitan-style pies.Photo by Adam RapoportFortunately, dad that I am, I was literally the first one there, at 6:15pm sharp. This allowed me to take in the scene and make it to our friend Natasha Pickowicz\u2019s birthday party down the street at Scarr\u2019s, home to BA\u2019s pick for the best slice in all of New York City.So, yeah, I couldn\u2019t not eat more pizza\u2014this time a superb pepperoni grandma slice and an off-the-menu white clam slice. So, so, so good.Did I mention I went to the gym yesterday?Explore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
