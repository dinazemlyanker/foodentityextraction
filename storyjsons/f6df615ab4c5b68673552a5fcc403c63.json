At the end of the day, there is no why.\"By Eli KulpJanuary 31, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailCond\u00e9 Nast EntertainmentFacebookTwitterEmailIn 2012, at the age of 34, Eli Kulp quit his job at the iconic Torrisi Italian Specialties in New York to take his first executive chef post at Fork in Philadelphia. Within two years, he opened High Street on Market next door, which quickly nabbed the number two slot on the BA Hot 10 and garnered him a best new chef title from Food & Wine for Fork restaurant.Kulp\u2019s inventive but decidedly unfussy cooking was electric. Diners flocked to Philly for his breakfast sandwich, the Forager, at High Street, which stacks a house-made bun with smoky oyster mushrooms, braised kale, and a runny fried egg. At Fork, guests came in groups to order the darkly lacquered duck that arrives at tables whole and festooned with a bouquet of fresh herbs and flowers. Kulp\u2019s cooking helped invigorate the Philadelphia dining scene and push it into the national spotlight.Soon, he and business partner Ellen Yin started to plan an outpost of High Street in New York, with Kulp shuttling back and forth between the cities. On one of those trips in May of 2015, the train he was riding, Amtrak train 188, jetted off the rails when it headed into a sharp turn at 106 miles per hour. Eight people were killed and nearly 200 were injured, including Kulp, who suffered a major spinal cord injury, which left him confined to a power wheelchair with limited use of his arms. This summer, between tastings and meetings, he met us at High Street on Hudson to share his story. \u2014Devra FerstTorrisi was craziness. It was this tiny little place, a thousand degrees in the basement and I was working ridiculous hours. It was good, but by the second year I realized I needed to go off on my own. I knew I would never be satisfied if I didn\u2019t try to go off and just see what Eli can do.That\u2019s when I got a hold of Ellen Yin, my now business partner, through a mutual friend. She was looking for a new chef for Fork, which was already 15 years old at that point. I had never even been to Philadelphia before, but our goals aligned, so I was hired as the restaurant\u2019s executive chef. In 2012, we closed Fork for two weeks and invested about a quarter million into relaunching it. By the next summer, we were already building out High Street on Market.It was a new idea: A chef-driven breakfast to dinner concept. That wasn\u2019t really around back then. We didn\u2019t serve pancakes and waffles, or other typical breakfast items or fare or food. I grew up eating sandwiches for breakfast (I was never a cereal guy), so at High Street, we made them the star of the show.Our food was playful. We were reimagining of a lot of classics without presenting it in a fussy way. We took vitello tonnato (typically thinly sliced cooked veal dressed with a creamy tuna sauce) and made it a veal carpaccio with cubes of sushi-grade tuna and drops of mustard oil so the plate would look like a mosaic, and we served crab apple soup, which was apple soup with crab in it. There were a lot of plays on words, which was the Torrisi effect.The next year, 2014, was a pretty tremendous one. That June, I was named a Food & Wine best new chef. It meant everything to me because I had grown up admiring the chefs on those lists. Two months later, Bon Appetit came out with their Hot 10. I think they announced it on CBS and I was on my way to work and Ellen called me and said: \u201cWe\u2019re number two!\u201dI don\u2019t think you ever expect that kind of recognition, you hope for it, but you don\u2019t start a restaurant thinking you\u2019ll become a national sensation. The acclaim is validating, but it doesn\u2019t define you. When the recognition came, I would find myself thinking back to my days at Torrisi when I wasn\u2019t sure of my ability, but I knew I had to go off on my own.In 2014 and 2015, it felt like, \u201cWow, this dream\u2019s coming true.\u201d Those were really big years and there were only going to be more big years to come.When we started contemplating a restaurant in New York, I was going back and forth between the two cities a lot. I was commuting on the train sometimes three or four times a week. On the night of the accident, I wasn't even supposed to be down in Philly that day. I left early that night because I had just started Crossfit and I wanted to get back for an early workout. I caught a train left at 9:10 p.m. instead of my usual at 11:04 p.m.A few minutes into the ride, I got a text from my friend who I had seen the weekend before. It was a photo from that Sunday of me, my wife, and son by Park Avenue and 97th Street, near where we lived. It\u2019s where the Metro North trains come out of the tunnel from Grand Central. I used to take my son there after pre-school, and for a while, he would get a little spooked. It was too loud for him. That weekend, I was holding him up on the fence and I asked him: \u201cAre you scared?\u201d He said: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not afraid of trains anymore, daddy.\u201dI texted my friend back: \u201cDaddy, I\u2019m not afraid of trains anymore,\u201d as an inside joke. Two minutes later, the train I was riding turned a corner too quickly and flipped on its side. I went airborne and smacked my neck on a luggage rack. It felt like it happened in slow motion, but it all happened in a matter of two or three seconds. That\u2019s all it took. I didn\u2019t have a scratch on my body; I didn\u2019t lose consciousness, but I couldn\u2019t move. I was face down near a window, buried under luggage that had gone flying in the air. It took about 30 or 40 minutes for me to be rescued. I thought I was dying, not too many people experience that in their life. A lot of people who get into an accident say: \u201cI don\u2019t remember anything.\u201d I wish that were the case.My life since then has been a struggle of acclimating. You have to learn to live again. You have to sink into this life. Everything is a question mark; life is a question mark.I could barely move my arms at first. You\u2019re lying there in a hospital bed and you don\u2019t know what life is going to look like. You\u2019re still holding on to what you thought it was going to look like. You lay there thinking: \u201cHow am I going to be a chef again? How am I going to be a dad? How am I going to be a husband? How am I going to do anything?\u201d The questions just spiral.When I came home from the hospital six months later, I was depressed and my confidence level was shot. I really had no concept of how I could ever be happy again and I was struggling to figure out day to day how I could be effective. I wanted to fade out of the public eye; I was embarrassed. I would sit at home and say, \u201cLook at you;\u201d I didn\u2019t get back to the restaurant for months.One day in the winter of 2015, I was so bored at home, but I didn\u2019t have a car yet. I said to my assistant\u2014since the accident, I\u2019ve needed somebody with me all the time\u2014\u201cScrew it, let\u2019s figure it out and get down there.\u201d We got on a bus from the Upper East Side, then another, and another. Eventually we made it downtown to the West Village, where the buildout for High Street on Hudson was underway. I hadn\u2019t told anyone I was coming, so when I rolled in, the only people there were the construction guys, who had no idea who I was. I left really deflated. I thought I was going to be happy to get here, but it ended up being this anticlimactic, depressing moment.With an injury like this, you have to grieve. Everytime you enter an environment that you haven\u2019t been in since you got hurt, or see something you can\u2019t do, you go through a grieving process. Your body and brain has to compute, \u201cWow, this sucks.\u201dIn the past, I had this dream for the restaurant. I envisioned coming downtown with my wife and my son. It was an experience I had always hoped for and then it all got wiped out\u2014or, at least I thought it did.I look back at those days even though they were only a year and a half ago and I feel like I was a different person. Before the crash, cooking defined who I was and I couldn\u2019t do it anymore. I was angry. I didn\u2019t want to be creative.Everybody I met would say things like: \u201cOh, but you can still think about dishes and you can taste.\u201d Or, they would say, \u201cLook at what you can still do.\u201d For me, it was like: \u201cFuck you. You don\u2019t know. I know I can do this, that\u2019s not the point.\u201d I knew everybody was just trying to be helpful, but I have a pretty firm grasp of who I am and I knew I could no longer do it.I started to blame my career. After an accident like this, you need a why. At the end of the day, there is no why. An Amtrak engineer made a mistake\u2014that\u2019s why, that\u2019s the reason. Depression will make you feel like you have weights on your legs, so you can\u2019t move.But, by November 2016, something flipped. I felt like I could do it\u2014I felt like I could take back ownership of my life. My wife and I had separated and it was sort of an end of a chapter. I started to re-organize my head and figure out how I can be effective as a parent, as a restaurateur, as a chef. I\u2019ve realized that I\u2019m still very effective and, at the end of the day, I\u2019m still me, it\u2019s just a matter of that confidence, that energy, building back up.Eli Kulp and High Street on Hudson chef Sean McPaul\nCond\u00e9 Nast EntertainmentThese days, I\u2019m living in Philly and I\u2019ve had to switch my thought process from a chef to more of a restaurateur. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m forgetting about the culinary side, it\u2019s that I\u2019m using it to see other perspectives of the restaurant business. My involvement these days is listening, helping, supporting. I spend time strategizing with the cooks and trying to figure out how to get the best product to the table.I\u2019ll say to my team: \u201cI want to put tomatoes on the menu. Let\u2019s see what you got.\u201d And, they\u2019ll knock out some dishes. Or, I\u2019ll say: \u201cPut this with that and we\u2019ll see how it is. Is it good? Ok, great. Put it on the menu.\u201dSo, in a lot of ways, that part of my job hasn\u2019t changed.But, I wish I could get behind the stove. There were times when I had this idea in my head for a dish and it just couldn\u2019t get produced by one of my chefs. I gave up on it. Maybe I wasn\u2019t explaining it well enough or it\u2019s just not possible to execute, even though in my mind it was possible; those times have been frustrating.I lower my expectations because otherwise I get frustrated with what I can do physically. Mentally I don\u2019t have any excuses. There are no excuses for the way I interact with the staff or lead the team. Ultimately you want to inspire your team to do what you can\u2019t.After the accident, Jon Nodler filled my role as culinary director of three of our restaurants. I had hired him as a pasta cook back in 2012 and he\u2019s really grown into this position. I\u2019m proud to see that. On a trip this summer to Philadelphia, I said to him, \u201cLet me see what you got.\u201d He served me five or six dishes in 20 minutes. It was probably the best food I had tasted in a very long time\u2014from anybody. He\u2019s really talented, which is rewarding to see as a mentor.But, I miss being a part of service, I miss being the guy who fires up his troops and goes to battle with them.One silver lining out of all of this is the amount of time that I spend with my son. You ask any chef out there about family and the business and they\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s a difficult if not impossible balance. It\u2019s difficult to make it all work and very few chefs have done it successfully. In a lot of ways, I was probably on that path before the crash.I want to make life as normal for my son, who\u2019s now almost 6-years-old, as I can and I think I do a really good job of that. He\u2019s really pushing me to live a normal life, but there are of course adjustments and slip-ups. A little while ago, we were getting the apartment painted and he was on my lap\u2014he\u2019s always on my lap\u2014and something happened and a profanity slipped. I quickly said: \u201cUh, those are grown up words.\u201dThe restaurant business is hard for any chef, able-bodied or not. It would be easy to say I want out of it. I\u2019ve spent hours thinking about what else I could do. I\u2019ve thought about going back to school and becoming an attorney. But, at the end of the day, I don\u2019t know how satisfying that would be. I spent 20 years of my life pushing pushing pushing this creative outlet that is food. Then I had to adjust. I\u2019m not giving up the ghost yet.I have a lot of stories and this one is a long way from being finished.\u2014 As told to by Devra FerstExplore Bon App\u00e9titPhiladelphiaNew YorkHigh Street on Marketeli kulpChefsRestaurantsRecipes you want to make.
