See our past recommendations here!As Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s art director, it is Christa Guerra\u2019s literal job to know when something looks good. This makes her an invaluable colleague. Whenever I\u2019m second-guessing my own taste and need another opinion on a textile or a piece of servingware, I turn to Christa. These stackable wine glasses? Chic. This onyx stone bowl? Chic! This sculptural pepper grinder? Chiiiiiic.So when Christa Slacked me a link to these Baggu wine bags accompanied by \u201cwooowwww I have never wanted something more,\u201d you can be sure that a set arrived on my doorstep mere days later. Each bag is perfectly proportioned to fit a bottle of wine and tucks into its own tiny pouch, like a Popple\u2014ideal for when you need to schlep a p\u00e9t-nat to a picnic but don\u2019t want to be carrying around an empty canvas tote for the rest of the afternoon. They come in a set of three and like Baggu\u2019s standard-size reusable bags, they\u2019re made with 40 percent pre-consumer recycled nylon.But a product doesn\u2019t earn the Christa Stamp of Approval simply because it\u2019s convenient and functional. It must also be extremely \u201ccuuuuuute,\u201d and Baggu\u2019s prints most assuredly are. The Madras Mix set is patterned with a spring-y check; the Backyard Fruit trio features cheery strawberries, oranges, and plums; and the Animal Print is exactly what it sounds like, except these specific animals have an exceptionally moderne and sophisticated grasp of color theory. These wine bags are so charming, in fact, that they double as gift wrap; next time you need to impress your host at a backyard hang, hand over a nice bottle of vermouth, bag and all.Baggu Wine Bags$28 at Baggu$28 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish Loves ItShoppingPicnicRead MoreLifestyleThis Tea Strainer Made Me a Loose Leaf ConvertBy Meryl RothsteinRecipes you want to make.
