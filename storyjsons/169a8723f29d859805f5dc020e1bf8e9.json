This time around: how to start a spice collection and put it to use.Compared to ground spices, whole spices stay good for longer. And that means that unless your ground spices are top-notch, you'll get a fresher, more potent product from toasting and grinding whole spices yourself. But even though whole spices are The Best, ground spices are without a doubt more convenient. (I don't know about you, but I'm not toasting and grinding spices on a weeknight.) That doesn't mean, however, that you have to settle for sub-par spices. To make the most of pre-ground spices, follow these guidelines:1. Respect their short shelf-lifeIf their color or fragrance fades, toss them. If they smell like nothing, they taste like nothing.2. If you can, buy in small quantitiesThis increases the chance you\u2019ll get through them before they lose their power. How much sweet paprika do you really need anyway?3. Don\u2019t eat them rawBesides cinnamon, cardamom, black pepper, and chile flakes, we don\u2019t endorse the consumption of raw spices. Toasting or blooming spices brings out the most flavor.4. Just say no to pre-ground black pepperGrinding it yourself is easy, worth it, and, with this grinder, fun, too.This Pepper Mill Is So Much Better Than the RestI promise, this thing makes a HUGE difference.View StoryExplore Bon App\u00e9titSpiceRecipes you want to make.
