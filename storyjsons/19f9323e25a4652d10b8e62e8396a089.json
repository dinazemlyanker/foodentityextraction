Three stray taquitos. A half bag of corn. Vintage pesto. But for strategic, economic cooking, something had to change.\u00a0These are the 13 tips that have helped us unlock our freezers' full potential. Maybe you'll find something useful in here\u2014you know, between the ice cream cartons, the cooler packs, and the unlabeled quart container of\u2026is it soup? too.\u00a01. Always keep track of what's inside.Stick a list on the freezer door that says WHAT\u2019S IN HERE? Cross out as you go.2. Freeze flat, then store vertically.The best way to store cooked grains, ready-to-reheat soups, and mashed bananas is in resealable bags that lie flat. Once solid, you can line them up like magazines.3. Designate zones so you know what's where.Illustration by Sabrena Khadija4. For instant toast, slice your bread before you freeze it.The day you buy a loaf of good bread, slice whatever you won\u2019t eat for lunch and freeze it in a resealable bag. Toast slices directly from the freezer when the urge strikes and never suffer a stale heel again.5. Buy fish once, eat fish forever\u00a0for many meals.\u201cOrdering fish in bulk and freezing it has been a game changer. There are mail-order companies shipping everything from wild salmon to octopus tentacles. My freezer\u2019s packed with my last shipment from Fulton Fish Market. Because fish defrosts quickly in a bowl of cold water, I don\u2019t even have to think that far ahead about making it for dinner.\u201d \u2014Emma Wartzman6. Don't toss the small stuff.\u00a0Tiny portions of these leftover ingredients will certainly come in handy:Coconut milk, wine, and stock: freeze in ice cube trays, then transfer to bagsMinced ginger: bag itSave tomato paste: label \u201cNOT BLOOD\u201dChiles in adobo: use for impromptu cashew salsaCitrus juice: thaw for dressingsCilantro stems: hello, chutney!7. When you have big bunches of greens hogging the fridge, send 'em to the freezer.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve started blanching and freezing leafy greens like kale, Swiss chard, and mature spinach so I can instantly upgrade my omelets, pastas, and soups (and save valuable fridge real estate). I mold blanched, cooled, and roughly chopped greens into balls, squeezing out as much liquid as possible, before freezing them on a baking sheet until solid and transferring to a resealable bag.\u201d \u2014Christina ChaeyThese greens are ready for anything.\nPhoto by Laura Murray, food styling by Susie Theodorou8. A slow thaw is the best thaw.Drastic temperature changes mess with the molecules in food, you know, because science. So when it comes to sausages and pie dough, give them the time they need to defrost (overnight and 20 minutes, respectively) and stop googling shortcuts.9. Scallions and green chiles can go in whole.\u201cI love to freeze whole scallions, which I\u2019ll use to make ginger-scallion sauce for noodles. The frozen scallions are best used in places where they're meant to they disappear into a dish since they don't stay as perky as fresh ones. I\u2019ll also freeze green chiles to grate into dressings, dips, and stews. The Microplane catches the seeds, so you don\u2019t have to worry about accidentally touching your eyes with spicy fingers.\u201d \u2014Priya Krishna10. You can freeze cooked rice.\u00a0Bag it and fulfill your fried rice fantasies. Since it tends to get freezer burn sooner than other items, use it within a month.11. You'll never regret keeping a bag of frozen shrimp on hand.Toss in a brothy soupAdd to fried rice/stir-friesMake scampiMarinate in adobo for tacosSkewer and grill12. Frozen cookie dough > frozen cookies.\u00a0\u201cKeep a batch of portioned and frozen cookie dough balls around at all times. As they bake, the centers stay frozen while the outsides melt and start to set, yielding crinkly edges and chewy middles.\u201d \u2014Claire SaffitzLooks freshly made, right?\nPhoto and Food Styling by Emma Fishman13.
