Have a question? Email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.Illustration by Nicko PhillipsWhen you\u2019re eating on your boss\u2019s dime, what do you order, price-wise? I usually go for the middle-expensive option. \u2014Median-Minded MicahIs steak frites on the menu? Because if it is, I\u2019m ordering it. And oysters. The boss is ordering whatever the heck she wants, and so should you. You think ~$7 matters to the COMPANY? (Assuming you work for evil corporate America, not like, an elementary school.) Well, it doesn\u2019t. I hear there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch, so you\u2019ll pay for it in other ways. Like impending layoffs! Let\u2019s get dessert!Illustration by Nicko PhillipsAm I obligated to speak up if I feel like my coworker is eating something that is potentially unsafe, e.g. week-old crab curry? \u2014Concerned ChristinaMore like chill out, Christina! Let her thrive in her curious cubicle of crab creation. I believe her lunch is a big bowl of NUNYA.How long is too long for cooked crab to sit in the office fridge...and then eaten at one\u2019s desk? \u2014Guilty Gertie(Yes, I really got both of these questions.) Get it together, Gertie! I, too, like to push the limits of the concept of expiration, but four days is your limit on leftover shellfish. Furthermore, a smell test needs to happen before you sit down and open up the Daily Mail homepage. Because if there\u2019s one thing grislier than those headlines, it\u2019s what\u2019s inside that Glad-ware.Illustration by Nicko PhillipsWhat is the best food for eating politely during a lunch meeting? \u2014Busy BeatriceI hate so much that we live in a world where people are so busy they have to eat in meetings, chewing and smacking and talking with their mouths full of spindly arugula. It disgusts me, mostly because I want a bite. Now we\u2019re so busy that when we meet up with friends we\u2019re like, \u201cHow are you?\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cBusy, but even busier than usual!\u201d We\u2019re at \u201cbusier than usual\u201d now. What a BUMMER. Work less, people! But here we are, gathered around a conference table talking about \u201canalytics\u201d and \u201cconsumers\u201d and \u201cobjectives\u201d and your day is so stacked with more meetings like this that you have to show us the slimy inside of your mouth as it masticates plants. It brings me great sadness to share that these are the best foods to eat during meetings:A tightly bound turkey wrapSoylent barTray of grocery store sushiBone broth in a coffee mugGood-enough grain bowlParfaitSNACK BREAKImagine rolling up to your cubicle with a jar full of these Healthyish breakfast cookies! You\u2019d have a snack stash all week, and something to share with gossipy coworkers who come to your desk for tea.Morning Glory Breakfast CookiesThink of these textured, dense treats as chewy muffin tops that forgot to be unhealthy.View Recipe\u00a0Who pays when you go out to lunch with coworkers? Is it always the person who\u2019s highest on the food chain? \u2014Broke BennettThis isn\u2019t a date, you don\u2019t need to reach for your wallet all cute. Clearly the senior person who invited you or scheduled this meal picks up the check. When your colleague puts down a card, gush with thanks and say something about how nice it is to eat in restaurants with napkins for once. If you\u2019re eating among poor peers, split it evenly, ask everyone how much money they make because you haven\u2019t unionized yet and a union would never let such disparities exist, and then deduct it on your taxes. If you were the one who initiated the meal, and you\u2019re on a budget, do COFFEE, hello!Illustration by Nicko PhillipsCan you tell a coworker that they\u2019re chewing too loudly? \u2014Horrified HenriettaYeah that\u2019s a no. Do you know how fast people eat? One study counted schoolkids housing their lunches in under 10 minutes. I eat mine in around 13. Go for a walk if it bothers you so much; walking stimulates the brain and will make you a more efficient and inspired worker bee anyway.We get lunch catered at my office, and there is always a vegetarian option. Recently, a gluten-free option was added. But there are countless requests that an assistant has to endure: Macrobiotic. Raw vegan. Low FODMAP. No salt. How much is too much? \u2014Low-maintenance LorelaiI don\u2019t even know what FODMAP is and I don\u2019t want to know. Getting lunch delivered is not a restaurant experience, the food is coming fast and it\u2019s not gonna be delicate. If you\u2019re on a low-sodium diet, you and I both know you should be bringing your own lunch just to be safe\u2014your health is at risk if a mistake is made (and with an order that big, it\u2019s bound to happen). If your special request requires more than two substitutions or swaps, reconsider your order. It sounds like your company wants to make everybody happy, which is sweet, but if I were the exploited assistant, I\u2019d hand out the lunches and loudly announce everyone\u2019s requests: \u201cKEVIN, HERE\u2019S YOUR BOILED CHICKEN BREASTS AND PIECE OF AMERICAN CHEESE WITH A HOLE CUT OUT OF THE MIDDLE BY A STRANGER\u2019S MOUTH, JUST LIKE YOU ASKED, YOU ASSHOLE.\u201dIllustration by Nicko PhillipsTo order or not to order drinks at a working lunch? Is there a line between having a beer and having a martini? \u2014Linear LeonardContext is everything, but here\u2019s what is acceptable (and what is not) at a working lunch in which it is assumed you\u2019re going back to the office after.* If you\u2019re conveniently \u201ctaking a half day,\u201d the line moves down three notches.A pilsnerGlass of white wineOr hell, an Aperol Spritz~~~~~ LINE ~~~~~~Second glass of wineMartiniSecond martini*Unless you\u2019re John Cheever, no work is getting done after a lunch martini, I\u2019m sorry. And you can only have two if your colleagues are your friends and someone got a promotion. The last time that happened around here, two \u2018toonis-deep Christina Chaey ended up buying a $30 honey bear balloon at Balloon Saloon and then it broke off the ribbon on the stumbly walk back to the office and flew into the Manhattan skyline. And yeah, she cried. Then Balloon Saloon offered her a free replacement and everyone was happy again. It was an emotional afternoon, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting into on a two-martini lunch day.That\u2019s all for now, but if you have petty etiquette questions or recipe requests for me, email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com and be too specific.
