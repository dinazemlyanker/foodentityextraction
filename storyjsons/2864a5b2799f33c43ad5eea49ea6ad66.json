Many times.By Emily SchultzSeptember 7, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailAlex LauFacebookTwitterEmailWelcome to Never Fail, a weekly column where we wax poetic about the recipes that never, ever let us down.The funny thing about working at a food magazine is that everyone you know starts to think of you as their personal food concierge. At around 4:45 p.m. every day, my group chats will start going off with things like, \u201cWhat should I make for dinner tonight? I have two eggplants, a cucumber that\u2019s about to go bad, and some leftover grains.\u201d (P.S.: Make this). Or, \u201cMy uncle is coming to town and staying in Brooklyn Heights. Got any recs?\u201d (P.S.: That answer is going to be The Long Island Bar every time).Another thing that happens is that your friends, by osmosis, suddenly get super into having dinner parties. And because you happen to both work at a food magazine and have a type A personality, you feel completely entitled to then perfectly craft\u2014or micromanage, depending on who you ask\u2014these dinner parties to your liking. It's just what happens.In case it wasn't clear, I've been talking about myself here, and this is my real life. If I'm hosting in my tiny Brooklyn apartment, there's no way I'm making the entire meal myself, but I will plan the menu and delegate not only specific dishes but specific recipes to my friends. Which means that I'm always on the hunt for recipes that are delicious, beautiful, and simple enough that said friends\u2014who pretend to be inept in the kitchen even though they most certainly are not!\u2014can feel confident making. Which is where this tomato tart comes in. It's beyond impressive-looking, but basically all you have to do is buy frozen puff pastry, thaw it, poke it a couple of times, put some stuff on it and bake it.Can't go wrong with frozen puff pastry. Can't go wrong with this tomato tart.\nPhoto by Laura Murray, Styling by Sue LiBut just because a recipe is easy doesn't mean that the friend you delegated it to isn't going to call you, panicking, and need to be walked through it. So here's the script. First, let\u2019s start with the frozen puff pastry. You\u2019re going to find it in the freezer aisle of your supermarket, by the frozen pizzas. They\u2019ll usually come in a pack of two or four and TBH, this tart is as good leftover as it is hot, so make more than one! Oh, and it needs to thaw overnight in the fridge. This part is non-negotiable\u2014if you try to work with it while it's frozen, it'll crack, and if you try to thaw it quickly it'll get weird and gummy. (If you're doing this coaching the day of the dinner party, tell them to go ahead make something else. Caprese, maybe?)Moving on. You\u2019re preheating your oven to 375\u00b0F degrees and rolling your puff pastry onto parchment paper. IMPORTANT: wax paper and parchment paper aren\u2019t the same thing, and you don\u2019t want your oven to become a big old smoke box. Make yourself a drink, take a big sip, and then prick the rolled out dough with a fork a few times in the center of the dough, which will allow steam to escape and help the thing keep its shape. Combine a clove of grated garlic and a tablespoon of olive oil in a little bowl, and brush this garlicky oil onto the PP. (PP stands for puff pastry, obvs.) If you don\u2019t have a pastry brush, neither do I. Use your fingers! It\u2019s fun, promise.Then, you\u2019re going to slice half of a lemon thinly and scatter those slices\u2014rind and all, but without the seeds!\u2014all over your PP. Use as much as you\u2019d like, though I prefer it a little light on the lemon and heavy on the tomatoes. Use the other half of your lemon to make garnishes for Campari spritzes later and toss some torn basil onto your tart. Then you\u2019re going to cut up your tomatoes into rounds and layer that onto your puff pastry. A little overlap is good! This is a tomato tart in case you forgot. You\u2019re going to sprinkle with a generous amount of salt, pepper and oil and throw that bad boy into the oven. It\u2019ll probably take about 35 minutes, but just watch for browning on the edges and bottom of the pastry! Let it cool completely before you cut into it and bring it over to my house, so all the juices have time to set into their respective seats, and grab some creme fraiche or ricotta on the way over to dollop on top.Look at you and your tomato tart!It\u2019s the most perfect summer party appetizer, and a great way to spend an afternoon on the phone with a friend you're about to spend the whole evening with. Just make sure to reward her with a pitcher of spritzes when she arrives\u2014you both deserve it.Get the recipe:Tomato-Lemon TartUsing frozen puff pastry is the shortcut that makes this tart a new summer weeknight favorite recipe.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyNever FailTomatoTartRecipes you want to make.
