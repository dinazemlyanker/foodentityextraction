She had the Christmas festivities\u2014roasting a big fish, making tons of pasta, and coordinating the secret Santa list\u2014and I took on Friendsgiving.I would make several trays of stuffing, roast chickens (my apologies, turkey), and tastefully arrange the bottles of wine everyone brought over in an ice bucket on my bar. I live in a small apartment that used to be crammed with people and food alike (again, major TBT), which meant there was no room for holiday decorations. But who even needs decorative gourds, cornucopias, or candles shaped like flightless birds when Estelle Colored Glass\u2019s coupe and wine glasses are scattered across your table? (The answer is: no one.)Stephanie Summerson Hall started Estelle Colored Glass as an homage to her grandmother Estelle\u2019s love of antiquing and cooking. All of her pieces are hand-blown and vintage-inspired from warm orange wine glasses to blush pink cake stands. But I\u2019m partial to the coupe glasses. I want to drink freezing cold dirty martinis and sparkly Champagne out of them, no matter the time of year or the number of people in my apartment.\u00a0Even if my kitchen isn\u2019t crowded with friends this year\u2014and even if my table isn\u2019t covered in glasses of various colors and sizes\u2014I\u2019ll still be holding up my mint green coupe glass on FaceTime and toasting to the holidays.\u00a0Estelle Colored Wine Glasses, Set of 6$175 at Food52Estelle Colored Champagne Coupes, Set of 6$195 at West ElmExplore Bon App\u00e9titCocktailHighly RecommendShoppingRecipes you want to make.
