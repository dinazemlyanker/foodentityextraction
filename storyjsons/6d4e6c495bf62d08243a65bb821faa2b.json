The simplest versions always felt lackluster, and the ones I craved\u2014the Court Street Grocers\u2013level creations\u2014would require half a day to prepare the dozen or so fancy sub-components. Plus, they never tasted as good as the ones I could buy. It just never felt worth it.But once I started asking that same question of the home cooks, authors, and chefs I admire most, I had to reconsider. For them, the answer is simple: Nothing beats a sandwich.After hearing them out and learning about their various tips and tricks, I realized I had been overthinking the whole \u201csandwich\u201d thing. Sometimes, all it takes to make an old-faithful classic feel novel again is to add just one new ingredient, as the cookbook author Jessica Battilana does by adding sauerkraut to her family\u2019s favorite jambon beurre. Other times, it\u2019s all about using the best-quality ingredients you can find, as with the chef Meherwan Irani\u2019s truly transcendent-sounding \u201cfancy tuna\u201d sandwich.Now I\u2019m a homemade sandwich convert, and I think you could be, too. Here are seven ideas to inspire you the next time lunchtime strikes (a.k.a. tomorrow).Photo by Laura Murray, food styling by Susie TheodorouAvo-CheddarWhat\u2019s in it: Lightly toasted whole grain bread + mashed avocado + sliced cheddar +pickled red onions + shredded kale dressed with lemon juice and olive oilSan Francisco Chronicle cooking columnist Christian Reynoso describes his favorite weekday sandwich as \u201cmore of a philosophy\u201d than one that requires a set ingredient list. It almost always has mashed seasoned avocado, some kind of cheese, and dressed greens, but everything else is up for interpretation: the pickled onions might be cucumbers instead, or there might be some sliced tomato in there. As long as it answers the question, \u201cWhat vegetables do I have on hand?\u201d it belongs in this sandwich.Photo by Laura Murray, food styling by Susie TheodorouFancy TunaWhat\u2019s in it: Seeded sourdough + oil-packed tuna + mayo + olive oil + onion + pickles + pickled jalape\u00f1os + freshly cracked black pepperYes, this stellar-sounding tuna sandwich from chef Meherwan Irani of Chai Pani and Spicewalla in Asheville comes with some...specific criteria; but it\u2019s ultimately simple to put together. Irani\u2019s key ingredients: \u201cThe BEST tuna\u201d (he likes brands like Ortiz, Wild Planet, Bela, and Tonnino), \u201cthe BEST olive oil\u201d (he opts for Greek here), \u201cthe BEST mayo\u201d (for Irani that\u2019s \u201cHellmann\u2019s, duh\u201d), and \u201cthe BEST pickles\u201d (The Backyard Food Company's Czech Sweet & Sour Heirloom Pickle). Sense a theme here? Make sure your bread is lightly toasted and your onions/pickles/jalape\u00f1os are diced so you get some in every bite. And whatever you do, don\u2019t skimp on the freshly cracked pepper.Photo by Laura Murray, food styling by Susie TheodorouFeta and CucumberWhat\u2019s in it: Ciabatta + crumbled feta mixed with olive oil and red pepper flakes + sliced cucumbers + torn mint leavesCookbook author Yasmin Fahr eats this sandwich all the time (and we mean all the time\u2014it counts as breakfast or dinner, too) and especially enjoys it as an open-face situation. \u201cI always have feta (preferably Bulgarian) in the fridge and frozen sliced bread in the freezer, so I can eat a basic version of this no matter what else I have on hand,\u201d Fahr says. It requires minimal prep work as-is, but can easily be jazzed up with additional toppings such as a fried egg, mixed fresh herbs, or sliced tomatoes.Photo by Laura Murray, food styling by Susie TheodorouJambon Beurre with KrautWhat\u2019s in it: Baguette + sliced rosemary ham + good butter + sauerkrautOne of cookbook author Jessica Battilana\u2019s go-to sandwiches is a French-style jambon beurre with ham (rosemary ham is her favorite), good butter, and a twist: a bit of sauerkraut. With pre-sliced ham and a jar of kraut in the fridge, putting this together becomes a five-minute affair.Photo by Laura Murray, food styling by Susie TheodorouMozzarella and Milk Bread Grilled CheeseWhat\u2019s in it: Thickly sliced milk bread + butter + mayo + shredded mozzarellaThe New York Times Cooking writer Eric Kim says this comforting, monochromatic sandwich gives him mozzarella in carrozza vibes and \u201cfeels like nursery food.\u201d Because shredded mozzarella can be quite bland, you can really taste all the other flavors at play here from the butter, mayo, and milk bread.Photo by Laura Murray, food styling by Susie TheodorouEgg and Hot PeppersWhat\u2019s in it: Toasted whole wheat English muffin + fried egg + sliced white deli cheddar + butter + chopped hot peppers + raw white onionThis breakfast-leaning sandwich is an ode to the Italian condiment NYC pastry chef Natasha Pickowicz goes through a jar of per week: IASA\u2019s hot chopped peppers in olive oil. \u201cI stir it into mayo, spoon over noodle soup, drizzle on avocado, and melt into every pasta sauce base,\u201d she says. A big spoonful of the slightly ferment-y, not-too-spicy peppers adds instant complexity to a simple egg and cheese.Photo by Laura Murray, food styling by Susie TheodorouTurkey and SpinachWhat\u2019s in it: Squishy Italian roll + sliced turkey + Hellmann\u2019s mayo + baby spinachCookbook author and BA video host Samantha Seneviratne says \u201cI don\u2019t think this sandwich is going to win any contests,\u201d but that\u2019s precisely why it\u2019s so appealing as a quick-lunch hit: it\u2019s not overthinking itself. The most important thing here is the bread: \u201cIt has to be super soft but also chewy\u2014the Brooklyn delis around me always have something perfect\u2014and the sesame flavor ties it all together.\u201d As for the spinach? \u201cThat\u2019s just so I feel like I crammed a veggie in there,\u201d she says.
