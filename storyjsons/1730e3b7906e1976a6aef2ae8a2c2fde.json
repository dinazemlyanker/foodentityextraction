During a caffeinated doomscroll I paused to watch a heartwarming comedy of errors: Advertising executive Tom Bannister and his small children messily portioning out ingredients for marshmallow and blueberry granola, sneaking spoonfuls of honey, and showering their New York City kitchen in oats. In the tasting video that followed, Eva Chen, director of fashion partnerships at Instagram and Bannister\u2019s wife, is behind the camera filming him. After offering a complicated and self-deprecating flavor analysis\u2014\u201cGuys, watching this, did you know Tom puts this much effort in?\u201d Chen asks the audience\u2014Bannister rates his own granola an 8.3 out of 10.Despite the solid score\u2014and the 17,000 person waiting list\u2014I was initially reluctant to try Tom\u2019s Perfect 10. It\u2019s nothing personal. I\u2019ve just always considered granola to be sad and sand-like: the underwhelming fish in an overwhelming sea of breakfast cereals. But when I tore open a packet and shoved a handful into my mouth, I immediately understood all the hype.When you eventually make it off the waiting list and onto the eating list, the delivery experience alone is super fun. Every month a mystery flavor\u2014like Pina Colada, Flaming Chocolate, and Blackberry Chai\u2014arrives on your doorstep. For those of us who have spent the past almost-two years locked in a routine of sameness, Tom\u2019s Perfect 10 is a little crunch of novelty. Each flavor comes with a scorecard designed for you to rate the granola based on characteristics like appearance, texture, and addictiveness, which you photograph and send back to Bannister so he can keep iterating on the recipes.Photograph by Emily Simms/The Working AssemblyMonthly Subscription \u2013 Tom's Perfect 10 Granola$20 at Tom's Perfect 10We know Instagram algorithmically advantages people like Chen and Bannister, who are good at using it. The couple\u2019s connections to the advertising and media worlds\u2014Bannister is the creative director at influencer marketing agency Billion Dollar Boy\u2014went a long way in helping churn up demand for Tom\u2019s Perfect 10. But their sorta-scrappy process still feels humble and delightful, and interactive in a way that makes it seem like you\u2019re creating the granola alongside Bannister, his family, and their community of die-hard granola stans. And, not to over-philosophize breakfast, but compared to the overnight success stories that frame many food founders, it\u2019s refreshing to see all the messy missteps made along the way.I\u2019ve tried the Ginger Zing and Original varieties, and each one offers a burst of flavor. Aside from the chill, brown-bag packaging, nothing about this granola is expected. The Zing, spiked with candied ginger, Vermont maple syrup (also infused with ginger), and a hint of black pepper, is spicy and bracing\u2014like ginger chews in granola form. A whole bowl of the stuff will fire up your morning routine, but it\u2019s also the perfect afternoon snack or yogurt topper. The cinnamony Original was a crowd-pleaser among the friends I shared it with, dessert-sweet and packed with chocolate chips, pistachios, and dried cherries.Both were, as I immediately Slacked my colleagues, \u201ctextural perfection\u201d: clumpy and crunchy without breaking teeth or tearing up the roof of your mouth. At $20 for a 10 oz. bag, this granola is not what I\u2019d call affordable. But when you factor in the meticulously sourced ingredients, smaller-than-supermarket scale, and labor and shipping costs, it makes sense that it\u2019s more expensive than your average mass-produced brand.According to Chen, this whole granola experiment started with Bannister\u2019s longtime love of the staple. \u201cWe\u2019ve been together for half our lives, and every time we went on vacation there would be a breakfast buffet. I would get 56 courses and Tom would be like, \u2018Oh, I just want granola,\u2019\u201d she tells me over Zoom. \u201cI would get mad because I was like, \u2018That\u2019s not how you do a breakfast buffet!\u2019\u201d Eventually, Chen started posting stories of Bannister reviewing granolas to her Instagram for fun. \u201cIt was weird,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople really liked them. It got to the point where in playgrounds and on the street, people were coming up to me and asking me about granola.\u201dPhotograph by Martin Romero/The Working AssemblyDespite trying virtually every granola on the market, he still believed the perfect batch hadn\u2019t been created. So, right before lockdown, Chen challenged Bannister to make his own. \u201cI started [experimenting] every month with my kids,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then COVID-19 hit and it was a great bonding activity while we were locked in our apartment. I got creatively engaged in it and really wanted to continue making it better.\u201d The family chronicled their granola adventures on Instagram, where, according to Chen, \u201ca lot of people would DM and say, \u2018I want to buy it. How can I buy it?\u2019\u201dDemand for the product increased and by June of 2020, Bannister was renting a commercial kitchen to make Tom\u2019s Perfect 10, Chen was helping develop the monthly flavors, and their kids were sticking branded labels on the packages. In the meantime, the waiting list had ballooned out of control, and \u201cI had to figure out how to scale the production and the fulfillment,\u201d Bannister says.Now Tom\u2019s Perfect 10, which was formerly called Tom\u2019s Granola, is officially relaunching. It\u2019s the culmination of months of nerve-wracking, real-time feedback from thousands of early-bird customers. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to call it perfect,\u201d Bannister says, \u201cuntil, you know...\u201d Chen finishes his sentence: \u201cUntil it was.\u201d Shoppers will be able to buy a monthly subscription along with one-off bags of the Ginger Zing. And each quarter going forward, the highest-rated variety from the subscription \u201cwill graduate from the flavor-of-the-month into the core collection,\u201d like the Ginger Zing has, Chen says.Because it\u2019s December, I\u2019ve been carb-loading extra granola on top of my hot oatmeal. I\u2019ve served the ginger flavor over a warm roasted squash salad and on a creamy carrot soup for a little peppery crunch. The Original flavor is best with a scoop of ice cream or hot custard, though I\u2019m not above stress-eating handfuls from the packet. My only quibble: There\u2019s no way one bag of this granola is going to last me a month. Oh well! Like the thousands of others queuing up, I\u2019m willing to wait for a good thing.Explore Bon App\u00e9titLifestyleCultureRead MoreGranola SconesGrain-Free Tahini GranolashoppingNut Butter Wishes It Were Granola ButterBy Ali FrancisRecipes you want to make.
