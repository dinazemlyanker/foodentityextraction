Toasting your own nuts yields far more flavorful and fresh results than buying preroasted ones at the store. But recently we\u2019ve been taking things a step further by toasting a handful of nuts in a skillet with a few tablespoons of olive oil or butter over medium heat until they\u2019re super golden and fragrant. Save any of the leftover oil to boost vinaigrettes.Ingredients4 servings 1tsp. honey\u00bccup plus 2 tsp. fresh lemon juice3Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided1tsp. kosher salt, plus more2small kohlrabi, peeled, halved lengthwise, thinly sliced crosswise1large green apple, cut into quarters lengthwise, thinly sliced lengthwise\u00bdred onion, thinly sliced45\u20136-oz. skin-on Chilean sea bass or salmon filletsFreshly ground black pepper\u00bdcup coarsely chopped blanched hazelnuts6Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into piecesLemon wedges (for serving)PreparationStep 1Whisk honey, \u00bc cup lemon juice, 2 Tbsp. oil, and 1 tsp. salt in a large bowl. Add kohlrabi, apple, and onion and toss to coat. Let sit while you cook the fish.Step 2Swirl remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick skillet to coat. Season fish generously on both sides with salt and pepper and place, skin side down, in cold skillet. Set over medium heat and cook until fat starts to cook out of fish, about 4 minutes. Gently press on fillets with a spatula so skin makes good contact with pan, then keep pressing, cycling from one fillet to the next every few seconds, until skin starts to crisp. Continue to cook without pressing until skin is super crisp and flesh is mostly opaque, 8\u201310 minutes total (adjust heat as needed, but don\u2019t rush it). Turn over; cook until completely opaque, about 1 minute. Place skin side up on plates.Step 3Wipe out skillet and return to medium heat. Cook hazelnuts and butter, swirling pan often, until butter foams, then browns, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in remaining 2 tsp. lemon juice; season brown butter sauce with salt and pepper.Step 4Toss kohlrabi salad and serve alongside fish fillets, leaving excess dressing behind. Spoon brown butter sauce over fish and salad and serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over.How would you rate Crispy Fish with Brown Butter Sauce and Kohlrabi Salad?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkExplore Bon App\u00e9titAmericanSalmonFishSeafoodKohlrabiVegetableAppleFruitRed OnionOnionBassMainHealthyishSaut\u00e9DinnerRecipes you want to make.
