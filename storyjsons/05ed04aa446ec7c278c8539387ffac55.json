This week: the chai recipe that associate social media manager Emily Schultz just couldn't live without.I\u2019ve always wanted to be one of those calm, cozy people who have tons of candles around their apartment and are always drinking loose leaf tea, which is basically how I stumbled upon this chai recipe. Buying cup after cup of the stuff at my local coffee shop was starting to get pricey, so I wanted to be more economical by making it at home. I Googled a ton of different recipes, but a lot of the ones that were coming up had way more spices than could even fit in my spice rack. That is, until I stumbled upon this one. (FYI, I started making this magical recipe before I started working Bon App\u00e9tit. Some say it\u2019s fate, but I say it\u2019s the power of The Chai).It's beyond easy. You start by peeling a piece of ginger a little bigger than your thumb (this way, obviously) and grating it up like there\u2019s no tomorrow. Next, lightly crush a cinnamon stick and throw it in 3 \u00bd cups of water with the ginger. Wait for all of that to come to a boil and start doing a happy dance because your kitchen is already starting to smell like some sort of fancy candle store. Once we\u2019ve entered Boil Town, turn it down to a simmer and let it reduce for 20 minutes (approximately one episode of It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia).Turn the heat off, toss in your crushed cardamom pods and your black tea and let that steep for about 2 minutes. Carla uses this black tea and these cardamom pods, and I do whatever Carla says. It's wise for you to do the same.Making a drink with spices feels fancy.\nOnce everything is nice and steeped, turn your stove back on to medium-high, and add your milk and maple syrup. Important note! The amount of maple syrup this recipe calls for is totally flexible, depending if you like your chai sweeter or more ginger-forward. Keep it on the flame for the next five minutes, and stir occasionally so it doesn\u2019t foam up and spill all over your stove like a high school science experiment. (Definitely have never done that.)Healthyish side bar: If you want to use almond milk rather than cow\u2019s milk, omit cooking the milk, and let it hang in the pot until you see steam rising.Pour this fragant sea of goodness through a fine mesh sieve into whatever kind of vessel you like to drink your liquids from, and you\u2019re good to go! If I restrain myself and ~ don\u2019t ~ drink the whole thing in one day, I\u2019ll usually stir some espresso into it the next morning for an extra ka-pow of caffeine. As Carla says, \u201cBingo, bango, Bob\u2019s your uncle\u201d.Get the recipe:BA's Best Masala ChaiView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyNever FailChaiTeaGingerHot DrinkRead MoreBA's Best Masala ChaiRecipes you want to make.
