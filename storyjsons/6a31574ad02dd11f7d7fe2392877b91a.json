See our past recommendations here!I have a lot of hair, and it's really thick, so it\u2019s naturally always dry. One day, Kristen, the boutique hairdresser I\u2019m finally going steady with, suggested I avoid shampoos with sulfates. She picked up a small block wrapped in paper from a little display and began demonstrating how to rub it on my head in circular motions. I was super confused.A few years ago, I wouldn't even dream of buying a hair product that wasn't in a fancy shimmering tube with a 15-syllable scent description. But I was shocked to be sold shampoo at a salon for less than $60, so I walked out with three J.R. Liggett Coconut & Argan Oil shampoo bars\u2014one for me and one for each of my friends who also have challenging hair issues. Five years later, this shampoo bar is still keeping my hair under control.These bars have just five ingredients\u2014saponified olive oil, coconut oil, castor oil, sunflower oil, and argan oil\u2014so it takes a second to get used to the fact that you won\u2019t get that perfectly silky smoothness when using it. I like to drench my hair, lather up the bar in my hands, then rub it all over my scalp. (The bar develops a curved shape over time, which makes this much easier.) After rinsing, my hair feels super clean but not dried out. And the plastic-free experience is, of course, a plus. If only they made a conditioner to match. \u2014Christa Guerra, art directorBuy it: J.R. Liggett Shampoo Bar, $6.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
