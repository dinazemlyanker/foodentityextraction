This is the most refreshing drink you\u2019ll have this summer. Just add tequila.By Molly BazJune 26, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Molly Baz, Prop Styling by Emily EisenFacebookTwitterEmailIt wasn\u2019t until my first summer living under the wrath of oppressive New York City heat that I understood the life-altering power of Salted Watermelon Juice, or as I now prefer to call it, Woju. (Trademark pending.) The air in New York gets so thick you struggle to breathe, the humidity index hits 8 trillion percent, and a distressing sweat drips down your thighs on jam-packed subway rides sans air conditioning. If there is one thing in this world that can restore your emotional and physical equilibrium after a day like that, it is Salted Woju.What is Salted Woju you ask? Oh, it\u2019s just a perfectly cold glass of blended, then strained PEAK season watermelon, salted so that the fruit flavor shines brighter than you ever thought possible, served on ice. It\u2019s the kind of drink that makes a textbook case for the argument that simple is always better. If you or anyone you know has ever had a more delicious, more refreshing two-ingredient beverage in their lifetime, please make yourself known. I for one have not, which is why I will blending up and batching out this perfect salty-sweet refresher ALL SUMMER LONG.Whipping up a batch of it is a thousand times easier than pie. Cut up a bunch of watermelon, throw it in the blender with some kosher salt, remind yourself to place the lid on that blender (might sound obvious to some but trust me it has happened), and blend away for about one minute. Next, strain it over a large pitcher, pressing on the solids with a rubber spatula to extract as much juice as possible, and discarding any stringy bits. And Voila! Two ingredients, three minutes.There\u2019s nothing like a cold glass of Salted Woju for breakfast when the predicted high for the day is \u201cActual Hell.\u201d And later that evening, if you\u2019re feeling sassy, it\u2019s obviously begging for a shot of tequila, in a rocks glass with a salted rim and a wedge of lime, as in this Salted Watermelon Margarita recipe. So basically what I am trying to say here is this is a beverage that is there for you no matter the time of day, no matter your physical state, no matter your lifestyle choices. Salted Woju knows no bounds. Now if you\u2019ll please excuse me, I have worked up quite the craving myself.Get the recipes:Salted Watermelon JuiceIt\u2019s two ingredients and the most refreshing thing you\u2019ll drink this summer.View RecipeSalted Watermelon MargaritaIt\u2019s refreshing, naturally sweet without added sugar, and just look at that PINK!View RecipeAnother great Molly Baz recipe:Explore Bon App\u00e9titWatermelonSummer DrinksRecipes you want to make.
