In handheld mode, I could pass the time while soups simmered and bread doughs doubled in size by running laps in Mario Kart, exploring the world of Skyrim, or rehearsing Super Smash Bros. combos to unleash on my roommates. I\u2019d always loved video games and cooking as separate hobbies, but enjoying both at once left me with a lingering question: Why does the food in video games pretty much always suck?To be clear, I don\u2019t mean that food mechanics aren\u2019t realistic enough. Like, in a medium where just about anything is possible, I don\u2019t need to spend my time peeling potatoes and mincing garlic for a stew. My problem is that food and its associated pleasures almost always feel like an afterthought. In action games, food is usually the slow, crappy way to heal your character\u2014the last resort when you\u2019re out of medical kits or potions\u2014and in survival games, eating is usually more of a resource management problem than a part of the game meant to surprise and delight. Almost universally, it feels like video game developers view food as nourishment and nothing more, dooming their characters to exist on pixelated meal replacement bars and nutrition shakes.Luckily, even if boring food in video games is a pattern, it\u2019s not a rule. Some developers, both indie and triple-A, have found ways to make in-game eating feel exciting and worthwhile, proving that food-centric video games were possible all along. Just in time for the bigger, brighter OLED version of the Switch, these are a few of the titles that bridge the divide between my two favorite hobbies, each in their own special way. There\u2019s something for everyone: Maybe they\u2019ll get a gamer in your life more engaged around dinnertime. Maybe they\u2019ll spark the same joy you experienced while playing Cooking Mama on your old DS. Maybe you need a game other than Animal Crossing to justify preordering Nintendo\u2019s newest gadget. Whatever the case may be, to quote a famous plumber\u2014and Chris Pratt, apparently\u2014\u201cLet\u2019s-a-Go!\u201dFour Player Co-op in Overcooked 2 from Team17 Studio and Ghost Town Games.Cooperative Kitchen Chaos: The Overcooked SeriesWhen I look for a new co-op game (for non-gamers, that\u2019s a multiplayer game where everyone works together, short for \u201ccooperative\u201d), I have a few basic criteria. First and foremost is communication. Whether my friends and I are strategizing, adding commentary, or straight up yelling at each other, I want a game that gets us talking. Second, I love easy-to-learn controls so we can spend less time on tutorials and more time actually enjoying ourselves. Lastly, it needs to be more fun than just booting up Mario Kart, because let\u2019s be honest, that game is perfect. On this scale, I\u2019m happy to report that all three of the Overcooked games receive a perfect score.Overcooked places you in a series of cartoon kitchens, where you and your friends work together to fill customers\u2019 orders as quickly as possible. You can choose an avatar from a list of adorable chefs, including anthropomorphic cats, sharks, birds, mice, and more. Like in a real restaurant, one player might be in charge of preparing meat while another chops veggies, cleans dishes, or plates each finished course. (All these tasks are accomplished by pressing and holding \u201cX\u201d in front of the appropriate station and ingredient\u2014shallow learning curve: Check). Tickets come in too quickly for anyone to work alone, and the game ups the difficulty for each additional player you add, so teamwork and constant communication are essential for success. After 15 minutes or so, you\u2019ll find yourself using kitchen lingo out of pure convenience: \u201cHot behind!\u201d I say, dashing past my friend with a saucepan. \u201cYou call that a julienne, you fucking donkey?\u201d she says, checking my knife skills. What fun!If that sounds too simple, don\u2019t worry. Once you and your buddies get the hang of making burgers and simple pastas, the game starts throwing all kinds of fantastical wrenches in your well-oiled cooking machine. There\u2019s a level that takes place in a Fantasia-esque wizard\u2019s lair, where all of the furniture and appliances periodically dance around, forcing you to rejigger your workflow. Another kitchen is suspended from a blimp that\u2019s navigating a thunderstorm, so you have to put out kitchen fires each time lightning strikes\u2014but be careful not to neglect your customers! There are adorable bread zombies demanding \u201cgraaaiiins,\u201d and an Indiana Jones*\u2013*style canyon complete with minecarts to dodge and rickety bridges over bottomless pits. There are icebergs, castles, speedy food trucks, and so much more. It\u2019s like competing on *Hell\u2019s Kitchen\u2026*if Hell\u2019s Kitchen and Looney Tunes did a *Space Jam\u2013*style crossover season (by the way, would watch).The first two games are loaded with fun, but the most recent release, Overcooked: All You Can Eat, comes with all of the old content plus a host of new levels.Overcooked! All You Can Eat$40 at AmazonMy humble farm on an autumn day in Stardew Valley from developers ConcernedApe and Sickhead Games.\nNot for Farmers Only: Stardew ValleyIf you haven\u2019t let go of the cottagecore craze, this is the game for you. After inheriting the family farm, your character leaves an anonymous corporate job to live off the land in the titular village of Stardew Valley. You start small\u2014a few tools, some seeds, and an overgrown plot of land\u2014but with some patience, hard work, and help from your neighbors, you create the prairie home of your dreams. Want to raise goats to produce award winning ch\u00e8vre? You can do that. Do you dream of owning a riverside vineyard? You can do that too. Want to channel Gerald Stratford and go all in on growing massive pumpkins and other big veg? You can and definitely should do that.As time passes in the game, seasons change and bring with them new crops to grow, new life milestones for your character and their neighbors, and new holidays to celebrate. It\u2019s a game about community, and specifically about the way that food and the people who produce it are instrumental in building that community. Gifting your crops to villagers is a great way to befriend them, prompting new plot developments and dialogue options, and, in the case of the other bachelors and bachelorettes in town, the opportunity to fall in love and get married. Sure, the art is pixelated, but Stardew satisfies the very real part of my brain that wants to leap off the grid and start a new life on the range.The food connection already makes the game a winner, but what really makes Stardew Valley shine is the character of the village and its denizens, which are at risk of disappearing. In the background of the game, there\u2019s a subtle conflict between the townsfolk and a tech monopoly that\u2019s threatening to put the whole town out of business. You can allow the faceless company to outcompete the villagers\u2014and profit in the process\u2014or you can befriend your fellow residents, help their businesses survive, and invest your time, money, and energy in the town\u2019s future. If you like that kind of David vs. Goliath morality tale as much as I do, be sure to buy the game at our Amazon affiliate link.Stardew Valley$15 at AmazonLink standing over a cooking pot in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild from Nintendo.\nFantasy for Foragers: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildI won\u2019t waste space explaining why Breath of the Wild is a perfect game. Plenty of critics more qualified than I am have already made that point, granting the title a nearly unbelievable 97% score on Metacritic, which the aggregator interprets as, and I quote, \u201cuniversal acclaim.\u201d What I can say is that I have put hundreds of hours into this game and still feel like there\u2019s more to discover\u2014and I think food is a big part of why, four years after BotW\u2019s release, it hasn\u2019t gotten old.Playing as the hero Link, your goal is to defeat an evil spirit named Ganon, fulfilling your destiny and saving the realm of Hyrule and its princess, Zelda, from an eternity of desolation, darkness, and destruction. But that can wait. BotW\u2019s structure is loose and open\u2014there\u2019s no ticking clock, no fixed order or timeline needed to complete its many quests\u2014which gives the player freedom to explore its open world as much as they please. And you won\u2019t get far without cooking. Other than sleeping at the rare inn, food is the main way you replenish Link\u2019s health, so as you venture farther into the wilderness of Hyrule, you\u2019ll need to come prepared with skewers of meat, mushroom stir-fries, and a baked apple or two. Ingredients are available at shops in the game\u2019s major cities, but for the most part you\u2019re going to be collecting them yourself by gathering plants and hunting for game out in the wild.Where BotW stands apart from other adventure games, culinarily speaking, is that food is not only an essential tool for survival, but it\u2019s also an engine for more exploration. While hunting for boar in the forest, you may stumble upon a bushel of spicy peppers. Cooked into a dish, these provide Link with frostbite resistance, which will allow you to explore frozen mountaintops without harm. There, you might find an herb with a cooling effect, giving you access to scorching hot deserts, where another new ingredient might point you in another new direction. Experimenting with new combinations of herbs and spices creates useful power-ups that boost strength in combat, speed, or stealth. Choose the wrong mix and you might end up with \u201cDubious Food,\u201d BotW\u2019s name for failed dishes and concoctions, a term I have co-opted for the messy kitchen experiments I throw away before ordering takeout at 9 p.m. Unlike in real life, however, I am never discouraged in BotW, a game which leaves me hungry, curious, and inspired by how much potential has been packed inside its sprawling, beautiful world.The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild$60 $42 at AmazonThe opening screen of Cooking Simulator from Big Cheese Studio and Forever Entertainment\nZen and the Art of Kitchen Simulation: Cooking SimulatorI love high fantasy and sci-fi, genres that are the video game industry\u2019s bread and butter, but they can also stress me out. Like, the suspense and drama of shows like Game of Thrones and Westworld absolutely have a time and place\u2014but when I want to chill out, it\u2019s Beat Bobby Flay all the way. There\u2019s something very calming about a world where the rules are familiar and everything makes sense. When it comes to the games on my Switch, that\u2019s where Cooking Simulator comes in.First person as an anonymous chef, the player preps ingredients, tidies up, and fills orders for an invisible front-of-house. True to its name, it\u2019s a pretty realistic simulation of preparing food. A few things are simplified in the interest of time (salmon fillets bake in under two minutes, and most stews simmer for fewer than five, for example). Stakes exist\u2014you have a limited budget for ingredients and tools, a clock ticks for every order, and critics review your restaurant every now and then, boosting or harming your reputation\u2014but they\u2019re mostly there just to keep things moving. If you\u2019d prefer, the game has a sandbox mode, where you can remove the constraints of money and time altogether, allowing you to go through the motions of cooking your imaginary little dishes with no worries, no stress, and nothing to clean when you\u2019re finished. Sure, I could get off of the couch and make real food in my real kitchen. But I only eat a few meals a day, groceries aren\u2019t free, and my couch is comfy. Plus, I have not one but two (!) industrial ovens in Cooking Sim, and my landlord won\u2019t answer my emails about putting a legit one in my apartment.In a nutshell, Cooking Sim is my unapologetic brain softener where nothing matters, and that\u2019s the point. Even the things I don\u2019t like\u2014it feels like it was made for PC, so the controls on the Switch version are a bit clunky, and I still have trouble lining things up while chopping and pouring no matter how much I practice\u2014are a constant reminder to step back and take stock. If I ruin a dish in the game, it costs me nothing, and no one has to suffer through a burnt dinner. None of this is real, I think, you\u2019re doing this to relax. And I do.Cooking SimulatorShop Now at NintendoExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingCultureRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
