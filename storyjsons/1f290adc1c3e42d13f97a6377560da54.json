Meet all the winners here.At least once a year, I shake the moths out of my padded-butt shorts and ride the TART trail from downtown Traverse City to Suttons Bay and back, with a stop for fried smelt in between. It\u2019s a gorgeous ride that weaves through 17 miles of sleepy northern Michigan farmland with minimal car encounters. I inhale the green watermelon scent of mowed grass, greet each and every biker/runner/rollerblader with a nice Midwestern wave, and ask my partner, \u201cWas that a Confederate flag?\u201d when we pass one of the homes tucked into the woods. (On my last ride the flag appeared to be taken down.) Bumper stickers and signs won\u2019t let us forget that this is the one of the areas that helped get Trump elected in 2016. But I\u2019m here to talk about organic onion rings, sorry!As of last year there\u2019s a little sign that points off the paved trail: \u201cFarm Club .2 miles.\u201d Take that, and you\u2019ll crunch up a gravel path toward a big modern-looking barn and a horizon of postcard-perfect trees. The barn is a restaurant-slash-bakery-slash-brewery-slash-general store, selling wool socks, wine, and loaves of sourdough. It\u2019s time for a beer.Farm Club is a collaboration between Gary and Allison Jonas\u2014owners of The Little Fleet, a downtown Traverse City bar with food trucks\u2014and Nic and Sara Theisen of Loma Farm, an organic farm with an always sold-out CSA. Farm Club is about a mile and a half from Loma on the Leelanau Peninsula and about a 34-minute bike ride from downtown TC. (So okay, you don\u2019t need the padded shorts if this is where you\u2019re headed.) The space was designed by local architects Designsmiths, who made sure every detail takes you outdoors, with big windows that look onto the yard and farm. The building\u2019s unfinished cedar siding will age with time, like the rest of us.You\u2019d think that a place like Farm Club wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal in this farm-y part of the state, but so far the demand and profit for burgers and wings has been higher (and I can tell you a great place for both: Brady\u2019s Bar.) What makes Farm Club so special is that it takes an arguably bougie concept\u2014farm-to-table\u2014and makes it accessible, low-key, and familial. No tasting menu, no waiting list, ingredients aren\u2019t revealed from under a smoking cloche. We\u2019re sitting on a picnic table, looking out at some onion stalks, having a few cold beers while kids kick a soccer ball around.You can wander through the small farm on the property (the larger farm, Loma, is up the road), which is what I did with Farmer Nic, who\u2019s 43 and looks like the photo interpretation of Tom Joad on the cover of the Penguin Classics paperback of The Grapes of Wrath, if Tom Joad kept Google spreadsheets of planting schedules and had a sourdough side hobby. Deeply tanned and intense, quick to laugh. His wife, Sara, tells me that if you check Nic\u2019s pockets, there\u2019s probably a half a cucumber in there, which he\u2019ll pull out and snack on throughout the day.\u201cThis is our onion ring patch,\u201d he says, pointing to a field of 3,000 tall green stems with his baseball mitt hands. \u201cWe\u2019ve been growing this sweet onion variety called Ailsa Craig, it\u2019s an old variety from Scotland. It gets huge, really high sugar content. I said, Man, our restaurant needs to be making onion rings, and last year we did it. So we have a seasonal onion ring.\u201d One of the nights I visited, they were made with garlic scapes instead of onions, quickly blanched and coated in a tempura batter, served with a sweet chili sauce. I should\u2019ve ordered a second.Nic pointed out a plot of cover crop (oats and field peas that\u2019ll help replenish the soil for next year), budding Brussels sprouts, and apple cider trees two or three years away from getting any action. You can tell that when he looks out over the fields of crops, his mind is racing into the weeks, months, and years ahead. Sam Stachon, the chef at Farm Club, calls Nic a \u201csavant.\u201dHis approach to farming deserves a TED talk. A few years back he read The Lean Farm, which outlines how to run a farm using a system of efficiency called Lean manufacturing that originated at Toyota sometime before the term was coined at MIT in 1991. Now he\u2019s introducing it to every aspect of Farm Club. Sara laughs when I ask what Lean is. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be here all day!\u201d But Nic gives me the one sentence summary: \u201cThe whole principle is the elimination of waste, but waste is expanded to not include just product waste but time waste, movement waste, and potential [for waste].\u201dOne way they implement Lean manufacturing is by creating basically the opposite of an assembly line (which was, ironically, invented in this state). When the Farm Club team packages food for the market, for example, one person packs, lids, and labels say, hummus, one tub at a time rather than taking up a table of space to set everything out and pack them all, then lid them all, then label them all. This eliminates potential errors like putting the wrong label on 50 tubs of hummus.Following the Lean method, they actually scaled back the acres they grew on, planting more crops in each bed. It improved how they managed the farm, helped with weed control, and decreased crop loss. \u201cIn the year we pulled back, we increased our profits by 20 percent,\u201d Nic says, \u201cso that really proved to us that bigger isn\u2019t really necessarily better for business.\u201dFarm Club brings the outside in.\nCourtesy Farm ClubBefore Farm Club opened, Loma Farm supplied a number of restaurants in the area and was a fixture at the Traverse City farmers market. But scaling back also meant they had to pull back their accounts with restaurants and at the farmers market in order to have enough produce to supply Farm Club. This\u2019ll open up space for other organic farmers to swoop in and grow in this area otherwise dominated by Big Ag. Per Nic: \u201cAs the population, hopefully, gets more exposed to [organic produce], these farms will have more and more market. But Loma stepping out creates a really big opportunity because we were primarily a restaurant supplier.\u201d\u201cBut the thing is, people get into [farming] and quickly realize that it\u2019s a racket,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt is so hard and the margins are tiny.\u201d We laugh, because this crazy bastard clearly loves this racket. He\u2019s been farming for 20 years\u2014first in Colorado, now here. (His father\u2019s family were dairymen in Wisconsin, but his dad opted out.) He picks a bulb of garlic, peels off the outer layers, and hands it to me so I get a close-up of his permanent soil manicure. In July they hung bundles of garlic from the awning of Farm Club to \u201ccure\u201d for winter storage. There\u2019s no Cracker Barrel decor here; it\u2019s all real.When Farm Club opened during the pandemic, it was tested from all fronts. Global pandemic, Michigan winter, and then the labor crisis combined with the lack of affordable housing in the area. \u201cWhen people do want to move up here to work here,\u201d Sara says, \u201cif they can\u2019t find housing, we lose out on them.\u201d The nights I visited, the waitstaff was largely made up of local high school kids and college students home for the summer.Farm Club not only hung on, it\u2019s become both a destination restaurant and a neighborhood gathering spot on Tuesday and Friday nights when it\u2019s CSA pickup day. They\u2019ve even been able to attract staff because a job requirement for all positions is to put in a weekly farm shift. \u201cWe hire these bartenders who have been in the industry forever, and we\u2019re like, \u2018Heads up, you\u2019re going to have to work in the field once a week,\u2019\u201d says co-owner Allison Jonas, \u201cAnd, they\u2019re like, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here interviewing. I want to. I want to be outside. I want to get that experience.\u2019\u201d Chef Sam told me his last duty was pruning the elderflower bushes and weeding sugar snap peas and fava beans. His wife joined him\u2014for fun.Could that practice spark a younger generation to get into farming? The average age of farmers in Michigan is 56, and as the industry profit margins dwindle, the sons and daughters of farmers aren\u2019t staying in the business\u2014a story you\u2019ve heard before. Yet we want to eat better for our bodies and the planet. So...maybe?Chef Sam also comes from a farming family in northern Michigan, where he learned how to butcher a chicken and preserve everything under the sun. \u201cI\u2019m 35, but I feel like I grew up in the early 1900s,\u201d he says, laughing, before telling me about how they\u2019re freezing gooseberries for the winter this week. He worked in whole-animal butchery in North Carolina and then opened two not-for-profit community restaurants that employed and trained people without housing and other neighbors in need before finding his way back to Michigan. When we sat down to talk at a table outside, he used the kitchen towel around his shoulder to wipe the rainwater off my seat. His heart radiates off his sleeve. When he started at Farm Club this spring, he told his fianc\u00e9e, \u201cIt never feels like I\u2019m at work. It feels like I get to come to play land every day.\u201dEvery Friday at 8 a.m., he has a \u201cFarm Walk\u201d with Nic, where they scope out what\u2019s finally ripe, how much they have, and how they\u2019ll cook it. Loma farms only around five acres; it\u2019s not a huge farm, so they tend to run out of things pretty quickly and have to think on their feet. There\u2019s a polenta dish on the menu that can easily sub in different vegetables (and don\u2019t even ask; of course they mill the polenta themselves)\u2014I had it with turnips in early July and beets in late July. As I write this in August, I\u2019m trying to plan a trip later in the month because I want a \u201chot melon,\u201d which, contrary to what I thought, is not a spicy melon but a watermelon cracked open and served still warm from the sun. \u201cIt\u2019s an unparalleled experience,\u201d Nic says, eyes wide. I believe him.More Stories from Heads of the Table:Introducing Heads of the Table, the trailblazing, community-building, future-making leaders changing the restaurant industry for good.How Michael Carter\u2019s time in prison shaped his perspective on the justice system and gave him purpose at Down North Pizza in Philadelphia.When COVID brought NYC restaurants to a halt, Send Chinatown Love helped Ruth Li\u2019s restaurant survive.Restaurants are still struggling, but chef Edward Lee is optimistic about what\u2019s to come.During the pandemic, Francesca Hong went from chef to politician\u2014and she\u2019s not done fighting for food workers.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsHeads of the TableFuture of RestaurantsRecipes you want to make.
