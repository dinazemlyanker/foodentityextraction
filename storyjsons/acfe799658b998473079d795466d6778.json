The falls do stun the soul. They defy language. It is impossible to convey their thunder, the palpable rattling power of the water as it reaches this climax. You feel real small. I stood on the platform, my skin dewy. Gulls darted in and out of the mist and rainbows threatened. Friends had told me to buy a ticket to ride the boat, the Maid of the Mist. But I couldn\u2019t do it; the line seemed slow and I was already contending with the very real problem of how I was going to pee.This is the reality of what being in public is like for me now, a big reason I seldom go anywhere if I can avoid it: Whenever I have to navigate spaces like airports and restaurants and rest stops, I\u2019m forced to contend with gendered restrooms. That day in Niagara, I opened an app that I\u2019ve come to rely on whenever I leave the house, called Refuge Restrooms. It\u2019s a crowdsourced database of bathrooms that are safe(r) for folks such as myself. In any given location, you can browse the map, and up will pop purple pins denoting bathrooms previously users have added. At Niagara Falls, I browsed the app for anywhere to go nearby and, as can happen, came up with squat.I\u2019ve known I wasn\u2019t cisgendered for forever. But it was only a few years ago, in my early thirties, that I admitted to myself, then others, that a word for what I am is nonbinary; another is trans. At this point I don\u2019t sufficiently pass as either \u201cman\u201d or \u201cwoman,\u201d so I can go in neither a women\u2019s restroom nor a men\u2019s. Women give me big dramatic double takes and make snide, shitty comments. Men are scary. Either way, in a segregated restroom, supposing I could even get inside a stall, my anxiety will be so high I won\u2019t be able to physically pee. The few times in recent years when I\u2019ve willed myself into a women\u2019s room, I haven\u2019t been able to do anything except try and try and try and then sit and sweat and wait until a quiet moment when I could dart free.Especially since I\u2019ve begun to come out, my desire to travel, to go anywhere for curiosity or pleasure, has atrophied so greatly I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s gone for good.As a young person, I traveled incessantly, said yes to every opportunity to go anywhere I possibly could\u2014I joined groups and activities so I could go on their trips abroad; I managed to get invited along on friends\u2019 family reunions overseas. I backpacked and I road tripped. I\u2019ve been to six continents, something like 40 countries, and all but a few of the American states. And yet, especially since I\u2019ve begun to come out, my desire to travel, to go anywhere for curiosity or pleasure, has atrophied so greatly I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s gone for good.I\u2019m not sure the last time I took \u201ca vacation.\u201d I\u2019ve planned several such trips over the last few years but cancelled them all for one reason or another. I still browse flight prices and write itineraries in my mind, but I have no plans to go anywhere. I am fortunate to live in a place I love and often tell myself there\u2019s nowhere I\u2019d rather go. Over the last few years, my work as a journalist and author has also necessitated a fair amount of travel. Hence, if I\u2019m somewhere for work, I try to tack on some sightseeing.The area around Niagara Falls reminded me of the tourist sites I grew up closest to: Muir Woods, Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. It felt like every nation of the world was there with their kids, their grandmother, their strollers and bags. A gaggle of one language and garb, and another. I walked around, scouting for a gender-neutral restroom, vaguely hoping the app just lacked data. But the restrooms were separate annexes with big signs saying WOMEN\u2019S and MEN\u2019S, people streaming in and out like worker bees at the mouth of a colony.Refuge Restroom\u2019s logo features a white figure like you\u2019d see on any bathroom sign, but rather than wearing just a dress or pants, it\u2019s sporting a half-dress, half-pants look, on a purple background. Whenever I see this logo, I reflect on how it\u2019s both nothing like me and everything like me, this half-pants, half-dress figure. I do hope that someday, maybe even in my lifetime, such bathroom signs will look as silly to everyone else as they do to me\u2014signs that signify \u201ctoilet\u201d but depict humans of binary gender.The Refuge app\u2019s closest bathroom suggestions were an LGBTQ center and a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts a half hour back out of my way. As often happens, I found myself daydreaming about whoever entered these data\u2014the Dunkin\u2019 patron, for example. I wondered about their life. I felt gratitude toward them. I\u2019ll sometimes open the Refuge app just to be reminded that there have been other trans and gender-nonconforming people where I am, that I am not totally alone. It is such a dangerously tempting myth, when you are trans, that you are totally alone.Leaving Niagara Falls, now in some pain, I had an epiphany: I had previously seen Trader Joe\u2019s on Refuge. I wondered if there was a Trader Joe\u2019s nearby. Indeed, only a little off the highway, I found one. Inside, to the back, was a row of a single-use restrooms. I cannot tell you the relief.Before I got back on the road, I of course bought some peanut-butter-filled pretzels and dried pineapple and other such glorious snacks. And I opened the app and added the datapoint of this restroom, for anyone else who might need it.Explore Bon App\u00e9titGo Here NowHealthyishessayRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
