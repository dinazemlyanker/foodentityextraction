I\u2019m Pretty Sure All This Booze Is Giving Me Acne\u00a0Does alcohol cause acne??? An investigation.By Ali FrancisJanuary 3, 2022FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Ina JangFacebookTwitterEmailDear Universe,I would say I hope you\u2019re well, but this isn\u2019t really about you, is it? No, it\u2019s about me, and the burning question I hope you can help me answer: Does alcohol cause acne???I\u2019m asking because, after a jolly holiday season of margaritas at the office party, honey-laden hot toddies after cold ski days, and poppin\u2019 bottles on New Year\u2019s Eve, a vagrant cast of cystic pimples are living rent-free on my forehead and chin. If they could\u2014they\u2019ve only got pus for brains\u2014I\u2019m sure they\u2019d point their greasy little fingers at booze and say, \u201cHe dunnit.\u201d I know it, they know it, but can dermatology prove it?Listen, at this point in my testimony, I should probably disclose that I\u2019m not new to this rodeo. I have endometriosis, the inflammatory disease affecting roughly 10% of people with periods. And after enjoying clear skin throughout my teen years, bouts of hormonal acne have haunted the majority of my adult life. I\u2019ve worked through (most) of the insecurities our impossible beauty standards inspire (thank you, therapy), but I also know that when my skin is inflamed, it\u2019s usually trying to tell me something. So I have to wonder: Why so mad, face? Sure, I\u2019ve been pounding holiday cookies like the next guy\u2014but I do that regardless of the season. Which brings me back to the main point: Usually a light imbiber, I downed more alcoholic drinks in the past month than I had all year.Here\u2019s the thing, though: Skin health aside, I don\u2019t want to stop partaking altogether. But nothing else I\u2019ve done\u2014buy fancy cleansers, experiment with elaborate skin-care routines, meditate like it\u2019s my job\u2014has helped with the acne. So, Universe, can you step in please? Does alcohol cause acne? How? Are some types of alcohol easier on the face than others? And is there any way I can lap at the odd white wine without Puberty 2.0 rearing its unwanted head(s)?Yours,Grown-Ass Adult WomanAlcohol can trigger acne, but it\u2019s not the direct causeAs it turns out, bacteria, inflammation, excess oil production, and clogged pores are the true culprits behind all those blemishes. But alcohol can trigger many skin conditions, \u201cincluding acne, psoriasis, and rosacea,\u201d says Rachel Nazarian, M.D., F.A.A.D., a dermatologist practicing in New York City. Which means, essentially, that if you are prone to any of those issues already, slamming a flight of Jell-O shots might likely prompt some side effects.Booze is also a diuretic, so it causes dehydration, which, says board-certified dermatologist Rose Ingleton, M.D., signals to your oil glands to produce more, more, more! Not to mention, \u201chigh [alcohol] consumption may also suppress immune [system] responses, which could make you more susceptible to [a buildup of] bacteria\u201d in the first place.Ingleton explains that a big night on the sauce could also disrupt your hormone levels\u2014one study found alcohol can boost estradiol (a form of estrogen) and another found that the same went for testosterone levels in premenopausal women\u2014which leads to inflammation. Bad news for people like me: \u201cIn theory, those with already existing hormonal imbalances may be more likely to experience [acne] breakouts triggered by alcohol,\u201d she says.Mixed drinks tend to be the worst offendersIngleton puts it simply: \u201cSugary alcoholic drinks are going to be worse for your skin.\u201dAcne thrives on foods with a high Glycemic Index (GI), which means they have an increased effect on your blood sugar, and cocktails and punches can get pretty sweet. Therefore, Nazarian says, \u201cWe can hypothesize that alcoholic beverages with high sugar content would be a \u2018double whammy,\u2019 thus increasing risk [of an acne flare-up].\u201dWhile people prone to rosacea should probably avoid red wine, which can worsen the condition, Ingleton explains, acne sufferers like me might want to stick to clear liquors \u201clike tequila or vodka\u201d and skip the sugary mixers. \u201cYou could also try keeping a log of what you\u2019re drinking and whether or not it causes breakouts to figure out if you have specific triggers,\u201d she says.1 / 19ChevronChevronSalted Watermelon MargaritaView RecipeWater is your best weaponNazarian\u2019s best advice for mitigating the negative effects of alcohol on skin is \u201cto hydrate aggressively before and after any event which you know will include alcohol intake.\u201d We all know water is good for us, and it\u2019s also good for our skin: When properly hydrated, it\u2019s easier for our skin to flush toxins and dead skin cells and balance natural oils.Nazarian adds that increasing dietary antioxidants like foods high in vitamin C can work to \u201ccounteract inflammatory triggers.\u201d For the foreseeable future, I\u2019ll be going to town on the kale, citrus, blueberry, broccoli, and strawberry recipes. It\u2019ll be delicious, sure, but it might also be the ticket I need to evict the Big Bois up top.Lookin\u2019 for the buzz without the booze?A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Making Weed ButterYou don\u2019t have to be a master chef or cannabis connoisseur to make legit weed butter.View StoryExplore Bon App\u00e9titLifestyleCultureRecipes you want to make.
