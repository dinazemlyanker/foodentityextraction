The owner brought out a large skillet with all the ingredients and cooked it right in front of us. Instantly, I was hooked on the experience of the food being cooked at the table, as well as the amazing balance of sweet, salty, and spicy. After we had eaten about two-thirds of the dish, my mom exclaimed bap chuga-yo, which means \u2018please add rice.\u2019 The owner told us to stop eating and proceeded by bringing a big bowl of rice, which she then fried with the remaining dakgalbi in the skillet.\u201d If you have about 2 cups leftover cooked short-grain white rice, you can do this too: Leave 1 cup dakgalbi in the pan, add rice, and stir-fry to make fried rice. Serve topped with dried seaweed and drizzled with sesame oil.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Peel one 1\" piece ginger with a spoon. Smash 3 garlic cloves and remove skins. Slice ginger and garlic. Transfer to a blender and add 5 Tbsp. gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste), 3 Tbsp. unseasoned rice wine or dry sherry, 2 Tbsp. raw or light brown sugar, 2 Tbsp. soy sauce, 1 Tbsp. gochugaru (Korean red pepper powder), and 1 tsp. mild Korean curry powder (if using). Pur\u00e9e on high until a loose paste forms (this may take up to 2 minutes depending on your blender). Transfer marinade to a large bowl.Step 2Cut 1 lb. skinless, boneless chicken thighs and/or chicken breasts into 1\" cubes, add to marinade, and toss to coat. Cover bowl and chill at least 30 minutes and up to 36 hours.Step 3Meanwhile, slice \u00bc small green cabbage as thinly as possible. Peel 1 small sweet potato, halve lengthwise, then slice crosswise into \u00bc\"-thick half-moons. Trim stems from 8 perilla, shiso, or Thai purple basil leaves, then cut leaves into quarters.Step 4If using fresh rice cakes, place 18 rice cakes in a large bowl and pour in water to cover. Soak until rice cakes are soft, 7\u201310 minutes. Drain well in a colander. If using frozen rice cakes, bring a large saucepan or small pot of water to a boil and drop 18 rice cakes into pot, stirring constantly to make sure they don\u2019t stick together. Cook 1 minute, then drain well in a colander. Drizzle \u00bd tsp. extra-virgin olive oil or vegetable oil over rice cakes and toss to coat (this will prevent them from sticking together).Step 5Heat remaining 3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil or vegetable oil a large skillet over medium. Combine chicken and any remaining marinade, cabbage, sweet potato, and rice cakes in skillet and cook, stirring often, until chicken is cooked through and sweet potato is tender, 15\u201317 minutes. Add quartered perilla leaves and cook, stirring, until slightly wilted, about 30 seconds.Step 6Dakgalbi is usually eaten as ss\u00e4m-style: To assemble one, place one of the remaining 12 perilla, shiso, or Thai basil leaves on top of one of the 12 lettuce leaves, then top with a small dollop of ssamjang, kimchi, and using chopsticks, add a piece of chicken, sweet potato, and rice cake for the perfect bite\u2014or create ss\u00e4m to your preference!How would you rate Dakgalbi?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (7)Back to TopTriangleI make this recipe without the rice cakes-- it's impossible to find where I am-- and instead serve with extra rice topped with furikake. I've made this about four or five times now-- it's excellent! I use sesame oil in place of olive oil. AnonymousCape Cod, MA4/3/2021This is incredibly complex in flavor and texture and we loved it! However, I purchased cylindrical rice cakes from the refrigerated section of our Korean market and could not soften them enough to eat, they remained too chewy. Any ideas?LindaPort St. Lucie, Florida2/7/2021never able to print recipe.  need to print, cant make w/o recipe!  so cant do review!\nAnonymouswashington1/1/2021Great recipe! I lived in Seoul and this hit the spot. Makes good leftovers too if you don\u2019t use rice cakes which don\u2019t reheat well. I doubled the portion and only used rice cakes on the portion we had for dinner. AnonymousAustin, TX12/25/2020Wow! This was such a good recipe. We went to our local asian grocer to pick up many of the ingredients and I think that really made it stand out even more. The flavor is complex and savory-sweet. It's not too spicy, so there is room to increase that after cooking if you want. We served in Boston lettuce leaves and with local kimchi. Definitely baby thai basil, too.
