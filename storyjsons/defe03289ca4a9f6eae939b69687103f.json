Each week, you\u2019ll hear from one of them, from a farmer in Winters, California, to a line cook in Denver. This week\u2019s diarist is Kyla Peal, one of the cofounders of Slik Wines, an experiential wine education platform, on how she\u2019s battling self-doubt as she\u2019s starting something new.\u00a0When the pandemic hit, I was a server and trainer at Elske in Chicago. My friend Marie Cheslik was Elske\u2019s wine director. After we both left the restaurant (for personal reasons), she had the idea of starting a wine club. We were sitting on her back porch one afternoon when she pulled out a big white board that listed the pros and cons. We just kind of sat there for a while noticing that we had more cons than pros. Our conversation progressed to what we knew was missing in the wine world and in fine dining\u2014diversity, equity, and inclusion\u2014and how we could develop a platform to support the wine and hospitality community. Our friend Danielle Norris, who is a wine rep, came aboard shortly after, and last August, Slik Wines was born.I was introduced to wine early in my career when I was working at an upscale steak house in Texas. That experience taught me exactly how not to teach people about wine. Our manager, who was the restaurant\u2019s wine instructor, regularly belittled staff if they asked questions he thought were silly or if we didn\u2019t speak with an absolutely precise wine vocabulary. I\u2019m not easily intimidated, but the truth is, that type of teaching style can really turn a lot of people away from learning about wine.When you\u2019re tasting wine in a group setting, you need to feel safe as you explore. If you\u2019re way off or guess the wrong grape, that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s the whole point. That\u2019s how you learn. Blind tastings are really a time for curious drinkers to hone in on what they like and what they don\u2019t like, so they\u2019ll be able to purchase wine comfortably and confidently. This is how we approach wine education at Slik Wines. We\u2019re making wine approachable and accessible while uplifting people and building a more inclusive wine community.I\u2019ve spent my entire life working in restaurants. Back when I worked at Elske, the dining room was my domain and I felt like my energy was magnetic. The connectivity of the restaurant dining room meant that body language was worth a thousand words. I prided myself in picking up on even the smallest cues to make folks feel at ease and having them leave with big smiles. Maybe I took those little things for granted because, in transitioning to Slik, it was a bit harder to convey my personality over the phone, over a Zoom call, and through emails. I\u2019d initially struggled with translating my style of communicating to the new methods we have to deal with today.I guess I thought I\u2019d immediately be really, really good in my new role like before. But that wasn\u2019t necessarily the case. My transition came with a learning curve that was steeper than I\u2019d anticipated and that slowly began to eat away at my confidence.Photo by Alex J. RiveraThere were times when I felt like I wasn\u2019t adding value to the Slik team in the ways that I\u2019d wanted. I had these big ideas, things that I wanted to tackle, yet my efforts weren\u2019t yielding the results I\u2019d expected. I\u2019d send a thoughtful pitch to a potential client and would get a curt rejection in return. I think it had a lot to do with a lack of confidence on my end and because I\u2019m still building professional relationships in Chicago. While I concentrated the bulk of my career on hospitality more broadly, Danielle and Marie found their niche in wine, and they\u2019ve worked hard to cultivate and nurture their extensive networks. During our weekly meetings, I\u2019d contemplate how my partners had been able to add so many new clients to our roster. I certainly wasn\u2019t having a pity party for myself, but I was like, \u201cHow can I contribute more?\u201dRight before the new year, the three of us had dinner together. It kind of morphed into a business meeting. I shared how I\u2019d been feeling and, I mean, I couldn\u2019t ask for better friends, for better business partners, for better listeners. They understood where I was coming from and reassured me that, of course, they knew from the jump that I didn\u2019t yet have those deep connections. They reminded me that the skills that I did bring to the table, along with my strong work ethic and my high level of commitment, were valued. They told me I\u2019d been doing a good job. Sometimes you need to hear those things and you don\u2019t even know that you need to hear them.I stepped into the new year feeling even more excited than I was when we launched. And I feel way more confident today. I\u2019m really lucky to have these business partners. I trust these women and I appreciate them.Since the start of 2021, we\u2019ve been focusing heavily on private clients. These clients choose the type of event they\u2019d like, whether it\u2019s a company-wide class on a specific wine region or a customized blind tasting. The options are endless. We have plans to work with a few local restaurants like Kasama in upcoming months. We were lucky enough to work with them in December on a fun virtual wine dinner that was super successful and sold out. We plan on collaborating with them again this month for an adobo-focused virtual wine dinner.Hosting private virtual events is how we\u2019re able to support ourselves and that\u2019s how we can continue to provide public events that aren\u2019t cost-prohibitive for the community. We\u2019re planning on hosting one virtual blind tasting a month on a pay-what-you-can scale. So we\u2019ll find these super cool wines that are usually your standard blind varietals, nothing too crazy. The rate will start at around $10, but even if someone doesn\u2019t have $10\u2014perhaps because they\u2019re a restaurant worker looking for a job or are still furloughed and really want to join the blind tasting\u2014we\u2019d be more than happy to provide that service at no cost at all.The response to Slik has been overwhelmingly positive. Everyone\u2019s had such a great time and people have said, \u201cHey, we really needed that.\u201d That never gets old, hearing people\u2019s responses and them letting me know that they\u2019re just as excited to be there as I am.Explore Bon App\u00e9titWineRestaurantsRestaurant DiariesFirst PersonRecipes you want to make.
