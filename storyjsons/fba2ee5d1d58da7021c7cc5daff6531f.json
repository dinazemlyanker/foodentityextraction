The strata can be prepared up to a night in advance and stored in the refrigerator wrapped. Bring to room temperature before baking.PrintIngredients1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing1 large butternut squash, (about 2 pounds)Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper1/2 loaf of rustic bread, (from a 1-pound loaf of bread)6 ounces gruyere cheese8 large eggs1 1/2 cups whole milk1 (10 1/2 ounce) cans Campbell's Cream of Mushroom Soup1 pound curly kale, (2 bunches)2 large leeks, white and light green parts onlyCrushed red pepperRecipe PreparationPreheat the oven to 425\u00b0 and brush the bottoms and sides of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with olive oil.Peel, halve, and seed the butternut squash. Cut into 1-inch pieces. Slice the bread into 1-inch cubes and grate the cheese on the large holes of a box grater.On a rimmed baking sheet, toss the squash with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Bake for about 25 minutes, tossing once, until the squash is just tender.While the squash roasts, whisk the eggs and milk into the Campbell's\u00ae Cream of Mushroom Soup in a large bowl. Season with \u00bd teaspoon salt and \u00bc teaspoon pepper. Fold the bread and three quarters of the cheese into the egg mixture. Let sit, allowing the bread to absorb the egg mixture, while you prepare the greens.Remove the ribs from the kale and discard. Tear the leaves into roughly 2-inch pieces. Slice the leeks into \u00bc-inch rounds and wash well.Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high and add the leeks. Cook, stirring occasionally until softened, about 3 minutes.Add the kale to the leek mixture by the handful, stirring after each addition to wilt the leaves before adding the next handful. Season with salt and pepper and sprinkle with a large pinch of red pepper flakes.When the squash is done, reduce the oven temperature to 350. Stir the squash and kale mixture into the bread mixture and scrape into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese.Bake the strata for about 50 minutes until just set and golden brown. Let stand for 15 minutes before serving. Serve with more red pepper flakes.Recipe by Campbell'sRelated VideoCheesy Butternut Squash and Kale Breakfast BakeReviews SectionReviewsWrite a review\u2026GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for the Bon App\u00e9titNewsletterSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyExplore Bon App\u00e9titCampbell'sSponsoredBasicallyMore from Bon App\u00e9titRecipes6 Pro Chefs Reveal Their \"Secret Weapon\" Ingredients2022-03-02T17:00:00.000ZrecipePorcini Gnocchi With Butter Sauce2022-03-15T09:00:00.000ZrecipeWhiskey Sour2020-12-16T18:20:00.000ZBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
