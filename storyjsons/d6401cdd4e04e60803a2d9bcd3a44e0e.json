Here\u2019s how chefs are reinventing pancakes (Coffee flour! Sourdough starter! Vegetables!).By Bon App\u00e9titSeptember 25, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by David AlvaradoFacebookTwitterEmailNo disrespect to that box of Bisquick you grew up with, but did you know you can make pancakes with sourdough and buckwheat and even coffee flour? Chefs do. Across the country, they\u2019re upping their breakfast games, transforming the ho-hum flapjack into a must-order item. We talked to six chefs who are making versions we\u2019d love to wake up to any day about their secret weapon ingredients.Barney Hannagan, Chef, Proud Mary, Portland, OR\u201cOur signature hotcake uses a batter I\u2019ve been perfecting with another chef since 2013. We make our batter fresh to keep it fluffier and use a self rising flour to make them more consistent. We throw a cookie crumb on there, shower it with edible flowers like nasturtium to give pops of those pinks and purples to go with the strawberries, and finish it off with a dulce de leche whipped ricotta.\u201d (This is the pancake pictured above.)Alex Manley, Director of Baking and Pastry, June\u2019s All Day, Austin\u201cWe love leavening batter with our mother, a wild yeast starter we use for our country loaves. Sourdough pancakes have a nice tang, are thinner than classic buttermilk pancakes, and have a texture that\u2019s less cakey and more airy.\u201dEmily Yuen, Executive Chef, Bessou, NYC\u201cTo make our Japanese-style pancakes nice and tall, we whip egg whites and fold them into the batter. I love how they get crispy edges from the sizzling pan we pour the batter into yet remain light and fluffy on the inside.\u201dRoxana Jullapat, Baker and Co-Owner, Friends & Family, L.A.\u201cBecause it\u2019s naturally free of gluten, buckwheat is easy to stir in vigorously without making tough pancakes; in fact, the buckwheat makes them quite tender. The flavor is subtle and aromatic but also has a nice earthiness.\u201dThe buckwheat pancake from Friends & Family gets drizzled with maple syrup.\nPhoto by Dylan + JeniJason Wilson, Chef-Owner, The Lakehouse, Bellevue, WA\u201cWe make our pancakes with coffee flour, which is made by milling the usually discarded coffee fruit into a powder. It doesn\u2019t taste like coffee\u2014there are more floral, citrus, and roasted-fruit notes. I pair it with cocoa powder for rich flavor plus vitamins, fiber, and protein.\u201dJaime Young, Chef and Partner, Sunday in Brooklyn, Brooklyn\u201cAdding malt powder (made from roasted barley) to our pancakes gives them a deep caramelized flavor profile. We top the pancakes with hazelnut maple praline sauce and brown butter to accentuate those caramelized notes.\u201dGuy Turland, Chef-Owner, Bondi Harvest, Santa Monica, CA\u201cWe put pure\u0301ed vegetables like butternut squash and pumpkin into our batter in the fall and zucchini in the summer. Anything with natural sweetness works. We combine it with kefir for tang and a little extra rise.\u201dNow go ahead and make some pancakes yourself:Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsPancakeTrends + NewsRead MorecookingThese Ham and Cheese Waffles Wake Me Up Inside (Yes, Like the Song)By Alyse WhitneycookingA Whole Grain Pancakes Recipe That Won't Give You a Brunch HangoverBy Chris MoroccoRecipes you want to make.
