His spiked fruit tea is intentionally not too boozy, but you can also leave the bourbon out. \u201cWhen I was growing up here,\u201d the Nashville native says, \u201crestaurants had three drinks: water, sweet tea, and fruit tea. Our welcome cocktail is an homage to the latter, as well as to punch\u2019s Indian heritage. (Punch comes from the Hindi word paanch, which means \u2018five\u2019 since originally there were only five ingredients.) I love fruit tea and wanted to bring it back\u2014with bourbon.\u201dIngredientsMakes 86black tea bags or 3 Tbsp. loose black tea\u00bdcup sugar\u00becup fresh orange juice\u00becup pineapple juice\u00bdcup plus 2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice1\u00bdcups bourbon (such as Buffalo Trace)Mint sprigs and lemon wheels (for serving)PreparationStep 1Brew tea in 2 cups boiling water in a teapot or measuring glass 5 minutes.
