We asked 80 of the most interesting people we know to reveal the local spots they love the most.Most people look at the schools or the crime rates when moving to a new neighborhood, but I have a much more specific noodle-y focus: chicken soup. My father\u2019s mother, Clara, died before I was born, but apparently she made a mean chicken soup. My Midwestern mother Betty\u2019s version of that Jewish Hungarian chicken soup had a lot less schmaltz and chicken feet, but holy s**t was it delicious. We ate it whenever anyone in the family felt even remotely ill or just for the heck of it because we all loved it so much. And then we ate it every night for the rest of the week because my mom made so much of it at a time. When I want to feel taken care of, I eat chicken soup.This woman knows she's in the right place.\nPhoto by Alex LauWhen I lived in the predominantly Polish neighborhood of Greenpoint in Brooklyn, I could find a bowl of chicken soup that tasted an awful lot like my mother\u2019s, and I ate it every Saturday. But when I moved to the border of Clinton Hill and Fort Greene (still Brooklyn) almost 17 years ago, I never quite found my soup. There was wonton soup from the Chinese place on the corner, tomato rice soup and avgolemono from the diner (there was also chicken soup at the diner, but I haven\u2019t had real chicken soup made with real chicken stock at a diner maybe ever)\u2014all of which were delicious, but not what I was looking for.Ten years later, I moved again, to Prospect Heights to move in with my then-girlfriend, now-wife/eternal queen of my life/mother to my Baby of the Year 2017. This time, I didn\u2019t have to look far for my soup. The first time I spent the night at her place, we turned out the lights and I immediately asked, \u201cWhat is that amazing smell?\u201d\u201cOh, sorry, that\u2019s the restaurant across the street, it makes the whole apartment smell like chicken.\u201dThe steam table.\nPhoto by Alex LauI love Katherine for so many reasons, but I would be lying if I left \u201capartment smells like chicken soup at all times\u201d off of the list. The soup from the restaurant across the street tastes like maybe the broth starts out with a little chicken base or bouillon, but after several hours of letting bone-in chicken pieces, carrots, potatoes, and yuca hang out with it in the steam table, that broth is rich, bright yellow, and exactly what I need. Some noodles\u2014which have also been in the steam table that whole time\u2014are present but don\u2019t have much texture left, and I love them for who they are all the same. Then there\u2019s some toasted and buttered bread on the side for dipping. I could eat that soup once a day for the rest of my life.The chicken, sans soup. Still good.\nPhoto by Alex LauAnd look at this! I\u2019ve ranted about soup for so long that I haven\u2019t even talked about the mofongo or the fried calamari or the oxtails or the cassava with pickled onions or the soupy rice or the other six ways that they will cook a chicken for you. (The soupy rice really is something special, and all of the chicken is wonderful, though the white meat tends to get pretty dry in the steam table by the end of the day, which most of their customers and I are into but I feel like it should probably be pointed out for the Bon App\u00e9tit crowd.)Definitely my favorite restaurant.\nPhoto by Alex LauAnd I haven\u2019t said a single word about the beans and rice! There are three kinds of beans and three kinds of rice and every combination is absolutely delightful, and sometimes I just go there and eat beans and rice with a couple of fried eggs or a side of avocado! And if you ask for a side of avocado, they will cut the most perfectly ripe avocado in half and give it to you! And they make a salsa verde that, if I ask for it in Spanish, they look confused and eventually ask if I want the green sauce, and if I ask in English, they look even more confused, but it is so incredibly delicious that I don\u2019t mind at all. Oh, and it\u2019s called El Gran Castillo de Jagua and it is my favorite restaurant.Tyler Kord is a chef and the author of A Super Upsetting Cookbook About Sandwiches.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Explore Bon App\u00e9titNeighborhood RestaurantsRecipes you want to make.
