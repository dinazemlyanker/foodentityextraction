I got my wake up call last Tuesday.For years now, I thought I was Mister Smash Burger\u2014you know the lacy, crispy griddled patties, glossed with American cheese, slathered with special sauce, and sandwiched between squishy buns. The kind you get at Shake Shack or In-n-Out.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!They\u2019re so easy to make at home that I\u2019ve shot not one, but two videos about how to master them\u2014one indoors and one on your grill. I even wrote an editor\u2019s letter about them for the magazine.But then we invited George Motz to the BA Test Kitchen last week. Motz does smash burger popups from Paris to Sao Paolo, he literally wrote the book on burgers, he directed a documentary on them, and we talked all things burger on the BA Foodcast earlier this year. And he took me to school.We were hosting a party for our Hot 10-winning chefs the night before our annual Best New Restaurants bash. Motz, we figured, could smash burgers so the rest of us could take the night off.Photo by Daniel TopeteHe let us know he would be making his fried-onion burgers. No ketchup, no mustard, no special sauce. No lettuce or tomato. Just patties, American cheese and onions. We were...skeptical. But then he got to work.He formed 3-ounce meat balls the size of, well, a meatball. He set them on a searing hot griddle, and topped them with a tangle of whispy-thin shaved Vidalia onions and a sprinkle of salt. Then, WHAM! He smashed the balls with his his heavy-duty Smashula\u2014like a judge bringing down the gavel. The flattened meat merged with the onions, and simmered away in its own fat.After a couple minutes, he flipped the patties, topped each with a slice of American cheese, and then topped them with slider-size potato buns to \u201clet em ride,\u201d so the buns could absorb all the steam and fat from the grill.And just like that, after about four minutes total, he slid two cheesed patties between the moist buns, caramelized onion whisps hanging out the side. No condiments, just some dill pickle chips to wedge in there.And man, oh man\u2014we were all floored. We couldn\u2019t wrap our heads around the depth of flavor and texture these burgers delivered: crispy, gooey, salty, sweet. They didn\u2019t need a thing.Motz was kind enough to gift me one of his iron-strong, made-to-order Smashulas. And I\u2019m going to put it to work this weekend. I know I\u2019ll start with freshly ground chuck that\u2019s 80 percent lean, 20 percent fat. That\u2019s non negotiable.I\u2019ll form smaller-portioned patties than I usually do. I\u2019ll shave sweet onions on a mandoline so they\u2019re basically translucent. I\u2019ll smash my patties with authority. And then I\u2019ll double them up. As George likes to point out, you get four crispy sides this way, instead of just two.And then I\u2019ll say no to the ketchup and mayo. If they\u2019re half as good as George\u2019s, they won\u2019t need a thing.Get the classic smash burger recipe\u2014but then add lots of onions to the griddle!The BA Smash BurgerView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBurgersAdam NewsletterRead MoretechniquesYou 10000000% Need a Cast-Iron GriddleBy Amiel StanekcookingHow to Make Special Sauce, a Perfect CondimentBy Alex DelanyThe BA Smash BurgerRecipes you want to make.
