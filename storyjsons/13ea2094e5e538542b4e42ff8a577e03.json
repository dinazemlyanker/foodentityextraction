Chef Angus An opened Maenam with his wife, Kate Auewattanakorn, almost a decade ago, and they\u2019re still racking up awards. Simply put, they\u2019ve rewritten the rules of what a Thai restaurant in Vancouver (and beyond) can be.ORDER THE: addictive grilled Thai sausage and crispy rice salad, tom ka coconut mushroom soup, and the eight-spice lingcod. Don\u2019t forget two orders of the handmade roti with peanut sauce. Bonus: The bright and refreshing cocktails pair exceptionally well with the food.THE VIBE IS: sophisticated and adult. The contemporary pale-pink space with cork-topped tables is softly lit and encourages quiet conversation.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day, from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m.; and for lunch Tuesday to Saturday, noon to 2 p.m. Reservations are available, as is takeout.\u2014Lindsay AndersonGrant HarderGrant HarderWE ALSO LOVEBeaucoupAn outstanding bakery worth the (slight) trek to KitsilanoPhnom PenhA boisterous Cambodian-Vietnamese institution in Chinatown that\u2019s still going strongThe Ramen ButcherUmami heaven and house-made noodles in ChinatownExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
