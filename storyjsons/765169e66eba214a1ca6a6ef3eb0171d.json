This version has all the essentials, and makes for a hearty on-the-go breakfast, but can easily be dressed up to become the star of a fabulous brunch\u2014add chorizo or bacon for a meatier variation, or summer squash blossoms or roasted poblanos for a lighter take. \u2014Rosalyn Vera, Cocina Luchadoras, Baltimore, MDThis recipe is part of Short Is Sweet, our collection of summer dishes that deliver a whole lot of deliciousness in 30 minutes or less.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I would not use 1 CUP oil to thin out the refried beans however more like 1 Tablespoon.  Robin FoxLebanon Oregon 1/28/2022PLEASE fix your printing/formatting issues?  Does not print with a photo?  Photo would be nice...  Anonymous1/26/2022I love molletes  and they are very easy to make but this particular recipe I just don\u2019t like  it\u2019s too much oil  also you can use  Mexican blend cheese   Basically you can spread your bread  I like baguette  with refried beans add some cheese on top  bake the molestes until the ch melts then you can add any salsa. Maria M\u00e9xico 1/9/2022Your recipes are fantastic!  HOWEVER, what is the reason there is not a PRINT icon OR when you highlight, copy, paste to save in order to print, the COPY is not READER FRIENDLY?  The QUANTITY measurements are ON THE RIGHT and not the left next to the ingredient..... easy to make a mistake with measurements.  Am I the only subscriber with this complaint about the format of your recipes?   AnonymousWindsor, CT12/27/2021Fantastic Brunch dish. I originally thought that was a lot of oil but it actually makes the beans very creamy. The layers make every bite delicious. The soft but crusty edged bread, creamy refried beans, runny egg yolk, slightly salty oaxaca, freshness of pico de gallo, avocado and tangy pickled onions. The textures blend really well. I\u2019ve made it a few times. I added some Mexican chorizo the first time and that was also delicious. This recipe is a keeper!ShanPonte Vedra, FL8/13/2021One cup of oil is crazy!LucyZPleasantville, ny8/8/2021Does this recipe really call for 1 cup of oil for two cans of beans? Seems like a lot. Mia you other reicpies only. All for one tablespoon of oil per can of beans Jlstephens Nyc7/13/2021my god thay are so good .Anonymouslondon england 7/9/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titToastMexicanLatin AmericanEggCheeseMonterey JackAvocadoVegetablePinto BeanBeanTomatoJalape\u00f1oChileRed OnionOnionQuickEasyNut-FreeVegetarianSaut\u00e9BroilBreakfastLunchRecipes you want to make.
