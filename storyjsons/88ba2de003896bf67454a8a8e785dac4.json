If it\u2019s already frosted or glazed or crumb-topped, you\u2019re stuck. In polite society, it\u2019s frowned upon to lop off some icing or streusel from another slice to get more of the good stuff. (Don\u2019t learn this the hard way.)That\u2019s why a cake recipe that\u2019s designed with sauce on top and on the side is a game-changer. Senior associate food editor Molly Baz\u2014who, as you\u2019ll remember, gave us Pumpkin Bread with salted maple butter to slather on as liberally as you\u2019d like\u2014has created a Sticky Toffee Date Cake to empower you to choose your own eating adventure.You can slice a piece and eat it as is\u2014it\u2019s not too sweet, it\u2019s dotted with pockets of juicy dates, and it\u2019s coated with enough sauce to drip elegantly down the ridges of the bundt\u2014or go all in.  For a dessert more akin to traditional sticky toffee pudding\u2014sauce-logged and  sticky-sweet\u2014drown your piece in the extra sauce so that it\u2019s a mere buoy in a sea of buttery caramel.This cake was a sponge (albeit, a delicious one) in another life: Thanks to the reverse creaming method, which we\u2019ve turned to for foolproof cakes before, it\u2019s fine crumbed: plush and springy, with no gaping air pockets\u2014the perfect sauce sopper-upper. And the sauce, though its name is intimidating, involves no melting sugar or candy thermometers: It\u2019s actually as simple as cooking butter and brown sugar until thick and smooth (this technically makes it butterscotch, then adding vanilla, flaky salt, and sour cream, which brings some welcome tang to an otherwise rich sauce.Want to dollop your cake, saturated with salted toffee, with more sour cream? Well why the heck not! This is your cake experience, after all\u2014who are we to control it?Get the recipe:Sticky Toffee Date CakeWhy shouldn\u2019t sticky toffee pudding be baked in a classic Bundt shape and bathed in a salted toffee sauce? Yep, we couldn\u2019t think of a reason either.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCakeDessertRead MorecookingThe Burnished, Fluffy Cheesecake That\u2019s Closer to CloudcakeBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
