Whether it\u2019s a slotted spoon or chef\u2019s knife, it needs to be the best, most functional version of itself. If it aesthetically stands out, that adds another layer. Ideally, it\u2019s a combo of both. Part of the way I find tools like this is by paying attention when I eat out at restaurants. I\u2019m that diner who inspects every glass, plate, and piece of cutlery.When I saw these Tableware\u2019s Not Dead steak knives from maker Roland Lannier at NYC\u2019s Contra, I knew I had to have them. For so long, restaurants have been serving their steaks with serrated knives, which actually rip through the meat. These straight-edge blades (yes, the more curved side is actually the dull side) make a clean slice, not a ragged tear. It feels just like slicing through a stick of butter.The perfect balance of beauty and utility.\nPhoto by Alex LauTheir slick shape is modern yet classic, and the handles come in different materials, from wood to bamboo, and more. Each set is different and unique. Sure they cost a pretty penny, but it\u2019s about investment here. These are knives I'll never need throw away. This year, I\u2019ll be gifting them to my friends in need of some oomph in the tableware department. Then they\u2019ll be ready to host a dinner party that will pass any picky guests\u2019 inspections. Myself, of course, included.Buy it: Tableware's Not Dead steak knives, $400 for set of four at eatingtools.comYou know what would make a pretty great holiday gift? Our magazine!
