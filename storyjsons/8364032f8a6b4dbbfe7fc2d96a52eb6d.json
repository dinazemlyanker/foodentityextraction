I make my bed only when I want to, do work on whatever soft surface feels most appealing. Most notably, I\u2019ve become as lax about my own screen time as I imagine desperate parents around the country have become about their childrens\u2019.Which is how I came to spend at least half an hour the other day watching Florence Pugh talk about soup into a front-facing camera, sticking a chef\u2019s knife into roasted hunks of butternut squash, extolling the virtues of chorizo (which she pronounces the Castilian way, choritho), and sipping from a large glass of white wine while the sun was still up.Celebrities, I\u2019ve learned through this experience, are \u201cjust like us!\u201d in at least one crucial way: They, too, are going insane. And while we\u2019re used to seeing celebrities broadcast every inch of their lives\u2014I\u2019ve watched Busy Phillips exercise more times than I can count\u2014seeing them in the kitchen is, for the most part, new. It\u2019s adorable and reassuring and almost obvious that we should all choose the same outlet right now: cooking.These people, in their multiple-bathroom houses, need something to do, some way to perform, and a phone in the kitchen provides that. Which is why we have Mindy Kaling making \u201ccakey, dense\u201d chocolate chip cookies (a genre I didn\u2019t know people liked), and Natalie Portman awkwardly chopping beets. Amid a sea of professional chefs extolling the virtues of dried beans, and (very helpful!) food websites soothing me with endless slideshows of glazed meats, the at-home celebrity cooking video has quickly become the most entertaining form of quarantine food media I\u2019ve seen.Charli XCX, queen of bops, has also taken to her kitchen amid workout sessions from Diplo and chats with Rita Ora broadcasted over Instagram Live. Charli, bare-faced and messy-haired, peels carrots very much not like a professional, makes no claims about connoisseurship, and seems to be doing this to share her \u201ctechnique\u201d as much as to keep herself sane.As she cooks, we see the stacks of Annie\u2019s Mac and Cheese behind her, her incredibly regular plastic cutting board, her imperfect knife skills. (On another Instagram Live video\u2014yes, I know, I have a problem\u2014she told DJ Zane Lowe that she\u2019d only started cooking four months ago.) Her video is endearing and entertaining in the way that a child making up a dance is: it\u2019s unscripted, unedited, intimate, and incredibly regular. Plus, it is always a treat to hear someone say the word \u201ccoriander\u201d in a beautiful British accent. Stay til the end, and you get to watch her licking melted chocolate from a spoon while listening to \u201cNothing Compares 2 U.\u201d From a certain angle, it looks like performance art, but it\u2019s mostly just a human trying to cope.Voyeurism is, of course, a big part of this. I have relished the glimpses Pugh gives of her country kitchen while extolling the virtues of an immersion blender, the cute little bumble bee apron she wears (marry me!), the range stove that might be bigger than my actual kitchen. And this is a far more accurate portrayal of what celebrities eat than anything I\u2019ve ever read in a magazine. (See also: Lizzo, making chilaquiles, making me want to make chilaquiles.)Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Even the more polished versions of the form are endearing. Take Jennifer Garner, who has long made what you might call \u201cnerdy short form cook-alongs,\u201d making English muffins from the (very good) Huckleberry cookbook. (I assume these are filmed by an assistant, who I hope is getting hazard pay.) She is so meticulous and her kitchen is so whitewashed she looks like she is auditioning, successfully, for the role of a Nancy Meyers heroine. (It tracks. ICYMI, Garner and the Barefoot Contessa are tight.) All I want as I watch her bake, while my bedtime comes and goes, is for her to tuck me in and give me a warm glass of milk.Of course, celebrities are nothing like us. They have better access to testing and medical care, they have assistants to refill their Home Edit-organized pantry when they run out of buckwheat flour, and they\u2019re probably not too worried about paying rent right now. But watching them act quote-unquote normal in believable ways is a soothing balm right now.As cabin fever fully consumes me, I\u2019m less interested in professional instruction; I want to yell at my favorite pop stars for not cooking their onions long enough before adding other ingredients to the pot (sorry, Charli), and I want to lull myself into oblivion as they prattle on about how many garlic cloves you should mince for your squash soup. Saying \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together\u201d often feels like a false platitude, especially where the megarich are concerned, but it\u2019s nice to know that we\u2019re all struggling in some of the same ways right now: manically, in the kitchen, with a knife and a pot and a phone.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCoronavirusRecipes you want to make.
