Even when it\u2019s not the dead of winter and cold and dry as hell, they\u2019re always swollen and peeling\u2014even bleeding. (Sorry, not the greatest visual for food publication, but there you have it). So now that it is the dead of winter and nearly a year into quarantine\u2014my hands have never scrubbed this many dishes!\u2014well, needless to say my cuticles have been desperate for some relief.Luckily, I found it in Burt\u2019s Bees Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream, a $5 solution that belies the quality of its ingredients and how luxurious it feels to use.Made with almond oil, lemon oil, cocoa seed butter, vitamin E, and sunflower oil (plus a few other ingredients you definitely CAN pronounce), it moisturizes and softens the cuticles while also helping to strengthen brittle nails. (The two often go together, ya know.) And though it\u2019s called a cream, it feels more like a salve. Just pop the top of the small disk-shape container, rub the surface to loosen it from solid form, spread a layer over the tips of your fingers, and enjoy the sensation as the stuff works its magic. Sure, it takes a few minutes to completely absorb into your skin, but it won\u2019t leave your hands feeling greasy or oily after-the-fact. (And that lemon oil? Oh it\u2019ll make your skin smell fresh\u2014and not in a fake, cleaning product sort of way.)I\u2019ve been using it on my cuticles regularly ever since I got my first tin\u2014which, I should mention was a while ago; it truly lasts forever\u2014and they\u2019ve never felt, or looked, better. This salve takes my hand care to the next level, and, paired with the hand cream I still slather on day and night, means that this pesky part of my hands finally get the special attention that it needs. Now I know my cuticles will be able to handle whatever comes at me\u2014even when winter (and bottomless dishwashing) ends.Burt\u2019s Bees Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream$9 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make.
