RossAugust 16, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailEvery restaurant should take a hint from Frenchette: Put as much thought into the wine as you do everything else. At this new NYC bistro, you'll find a wine list just as detail-oriented as the immaculate Art Deco-inspired interior. And while the cuisine leans traditional, Frenchette\u2019s wine list is a carefully curated and adventurous romp around the world with an international selection of bottles that may make you question the old adage, \u201cWhere it grows, it goes.\u201d Best of all, every bottle is natural.We chatted with wine director and natural wine evangelist Jorge Riera (previously of Wildair, Contra, and the Ten Bells) about pairings, price points, and the countries wine lovers should be focusing on right now.Frenchette\u2019s menu is totally a modern take on French cuisine, and your wine list is exclusively natural wines. What is so exciting to you about pairing these types of wine with this style of food?For over 20 years, I\u2019ve been going to France and eating French food with natural wines. I think the food pops more with these wines than it does with conventional or traditional options because of the way the wines are made, with high acidity, low alcohol, and not-so-grippy tannins. The wine doesn\u2019t overtake the food; it\u2019s refreshing. It washes over your palate and the acidity cuts through the richness of some of the dishes, and that same acidity brightens a lot of the dishes as well.Something I love about your list is that although Frenchette is well, French, the wine list is very international. What country are you most excited about these days?The wines that are coming out of Catalonia, and Spain in general. They are really pushing back against the Americanization of wine from the \u201980s and \u201990s. People tell me they can\u2019t believe the wine I\u2019m serving is Spanish because they are used to highly extracted, vanilla-scented wines. But now Spain is making wines in a more traditional way\u2014really bright, fresh, and energetic\u2014 and also taking a lot of risks. It\u2019s very exciting to me.Is there a country you think consumers are overlooking?Georgia. Even though their wines have gotten more press of late, they\u2019re intimidating to people because they have such a range of names we have no reference for, and there is also a misconception that all Georgia wines are macerated [skin-contact]. Also, they see a $20 or $30 bottle and think of it more as a fad. But those wines should be respected. People are afraid to go there, but once they taste the wine, they love it.Speaking of price points, you intentionally kept yours approachable. What was the thought process behind that?We wanted to have a real neighborhood restaurant where people could come in, have a snack and grab a bottle. Or if you come in with friends, you could have two or three bottles and you\u2019re not breaking the bank. It\u2019s all about the experience of eating and drinking and having a great time. And it\u2019s an experience you can have once a month, not once every two or three months. We want it to be approachable. Wine is made for the people; it\u2019s not made for exclusivity or priviledge.Are you seeing more customer engagement?Oh yeah. They\u2019re seeing things they don\u2019t recognize and going to different places than they ever thought they would. If they want a Pinot Noir, I introduce them to Pineau d\u2019Aunis and Gamay. Many people stick with these traditional and classical concepts of wine, but when you take the grape out of the equation and give them an experience, they\u2019re really grateful for it.How do you think consumers can get more out of their wine experience with a list like yours?Go with a descriptive of what you\u2019re looking for. For instance, Pinot Grigio. People may say they want a Pinot Grigio because they\u2019re looking for something dry with a bit of acidity, but they don\u2019t realize Pinot Grigio can come in all grades of color, and even with tannins. It\u2019s best to go with a flavor profile rather than a category or grape. Just open up, try something new, and have an experience. That\u2019s what wine is about\u2014the experience.Read more about the 25 restaurant trends we saw in 2018Related: So, What Exactly Is Natural Wine?Explore Bon App\u00e9titHot 10 2018The Hot 10Read MorecultureWhat Is Carbonic Maceration in Wine, and Why Does It Taste So Damn Fun?By Marissa A.
