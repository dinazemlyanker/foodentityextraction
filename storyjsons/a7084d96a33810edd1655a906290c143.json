The technique\u2019s advantages are clear: more surface area, more caramelization, an astonishingly quick cook time, and tidy pieces that are easy to share. Creamy, almost-but-not-sweet coconut milk will help tenderize and flavor humbler cuts like hanger, flatiron, and flap.Ingredients4 servingsDressing2serrano chiles, chopped (seeds and all)\u00bccup fresh lime juice2Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil2Tbsp. finely chopped red onion2tsp. honeyKosher saltSkewers and assembly2lemongrass stalks, bottom third only, tough outer layers removed, thinly sliced2serrano chiles, with seeds if you want some heat12\" piece ginger, peeled, thinly sliced4garlic cloves113.5-oz. can unsweetened coconut milk\u2153cup seasoned rice vinegar1\u00bdlb. trimmed hanger, flatiron, or flap (bavette) steak, cut into 1\" cubesVegetable oil (for grill)Kosher saltChopped cilantro (for serving)Special EquipmentTen to twelve 8\"\u201310\" metal skewers, or bamboo, soaked 30 minutesPreparationDressingStep 1Whisk chiles, lime juice, oil, onion, and honey in a small bowl to combine; season with salt.Skewers and assemblyStep 2Pur\u00e9e lemongrass, chiles, ginger, garlic, coconut milk, and vinegar in a blender until smooth.

Huge hit with my family and super easy to make as long as you have all the ingredients (which I actually didn\u2019t). I subbed lemon zest for the lemongrass stalks and they still tasted amazing! Anonymous8/5/2020Delicious kebabs! Used tri-tip steak, as the others were unavailable. Very tender and flavorful.AnonymousSeattle, Wa7/24/2020Good flavors although I wish they came through more! Marinated for a day but still wish flavors were more intense.KatiehwalshAustin7/11/2020This was a hit! I doubled the dressing because I always like to have extra. I paired it with the Miso-y Grilled Potatoes from the same issue. Prep for both can be done ahead and then the grill time is about the same for both the skewers and potatoes - perfection!AnonymousAustin, TX7/11/2020Really delicious kebabs!! I couldn\u2019t find flank in my grocery store so I used some beef tenderloin instead. It was a pretty good replacement but I would\u2019ve cooked them a little longer. All in all really good but just use flank. groseoWisconsin6/12/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSkewerAsianSteakBeefMeatSummerMainGluten-FreeKetoGrillingFourth Of JulyMemorial DayLabor DayDinnerRecipes you want to make.
