Ryan would fill his mug of coffee to the very brim and he\u2019d charge, helter-skelter, down the steps of our apartment, sloshing dark liquid onto the stairway carpeting.More liquid would splash on our drive to base. I\u2019d admonish him: Get a travel mug. He\u2019d retort: Unnecessary. A waste of $30. We recycled this exchange over and over until we couldn\u2019t bear the amount of coffee on the floor of our Ford. One last petty squabble over spilled coffee convinced him to leave Nordstrom Rack one day with a solution: a 12-ounce, synlawn-green, collapsible Stojo cup.Stojo Coffee Cup$15 at Amazon$15 at StojoI was impressed. Unlike my stainless-steel thermos, the cup easily collapsed into a round disk small enough to fit in the pockets of our Navy Working Uniforms. This feature alone convinced me to buy myself one too. On especially busy days, we could crush our coffee and then, literally, crush the food-grade silicone cup for stowage\u2014a useful feature on ships, where there is never enough space. In my husband\u2019s opinion, even useful enough to justify the already reasonable price of $15.The Stojo cup is not new. The company was founded in New York in 2014 by a group of dads who wanted a sustainable future for their children. (In addition to its being reusable, it\u2019s free of BPA, BPSs, phthalates, lead, and adhesives.) But since we\u2019ve started using our Stojos, I\u2019ve seen them pop up frequently on the Instagrams of planet-saving, remote-working, cropped-cardigan-wearing 20-somethings who match their nail polish to the cups\u2019 muted colorways. Even though we hadn\u2019t bought our Stojos to make fashion statements, I suddenly felt on-trend carrying around my baby blue collapsible cup. The rise of the Stojo is a little like that of the Croc: Both formerly basic, unremarkable dad products that are now staples of every hip cabinet and closet. Trending or not, we love our Stojos and we\u2019ll be using them for years to come. I\u2019m sure our Ford (and the planet) will thank us.Now fill that Stojo up:Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
