Choose shallots that are all about the same size so that they soften evenly as they cook. And if spicy is not your thing, skip the Fresno chiles.Ingredients8 servings4Tbsp. unsalted butter1\u00bdlb. medium shallots, peeled, halved if largeKosher salt3Tbsp. sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar3large sprigs thyme, plus 1 tsp. thyme leaves for serving2red Fresno chiles, halved lengthwise, seeds removed1Tbsp. sugarPreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 400\u00b0. Heat butter in a large skillet over medium, swirling until foaming subsides. Arrange shallots in a single layer in skillet, flat or cut side down where possible. Season well with salt and cook, undisturbed, until deep golden brown underneath, about 5 minutes. Turn and cook until deep golden brown on the other side, about 5 minutes.Photo by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiStep 2Add vinegar and 1 cup water, then add thyme sprigs, chiles, and sugar and swirl skillet to combine.

Since Bon Appetit recommended this as a Chanukah recipe, it's important to note that be able to serve with meat, replace the butter with a non-dairy fat, like schmaltz or a good olive oil.
