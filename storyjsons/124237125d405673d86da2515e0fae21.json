You could call it a problem. I call it a hobby. I just love them for the designs\u2014especially the ones that are metallic and loud. My girlfriend is the opposite; she\u2019s got a cleaner, simpler aesthetic. But the one matchbook we can both agree on is the one from Reception Bar in New York City.Owner Katie Rue opts for an oversize format with matchsticks in colors that pop and three different vibrant designs as the backdrop. \u201cThe backgrounds are actual images of Korean stamps with garden imagery that are zoomed in to become abstract,\u201d Rue says. They\u2019re are a nod to her Korean heritage as well as a natural extension of the bar\u2019s serene secret garden vibes. Soju is infused with ingredients like Korean green pepper and taro. Plants sit in every corner. A glass fa\u00e7ade lends a kind of greenhouse look.As a designer myself, I love how she took this motif and ran with it. It\u2019s why every time I visit, I run home with a few of these matchbooks in my pocket.Go there: Reception BarExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendBarsDesignRead MorecultureThis Little Incense Burner Makes My Kitchen Smell Better and My Heart FullerBy Bryan FountainRecipes you want to make.
