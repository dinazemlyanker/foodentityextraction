It turns out no matter how many years in a row I would resolve to stretch every day, sleep eight hours a night, drink eight glasses of water a day, moisturize after every shower (LOL), and exercise daily (bigger LOL) I\u2026never really ended up doing any of it. (I abhor being told what to do, and apparently that includes when I tell myself what to do.)While I don\u2019t believe in New Year\u2019s resolutions, I do believe in eating well all year round. And come January, after weeks of holiday sugar, salt, and booze, I\u2019m ready, to borrow a phrase we often use at BA, to \u201ccook how I want to feel.\u201d This simple philosophy inspired the seven new recipes I developed for the February issue of Bon App\u00e9tit, which is out now. I love seeing so many of you already making these Saucy Tofu Noodles With Cucumbers and Chili Crisp, which I developed while combating tofu fatigue, a thing I didn\u2019t know was possible for me. I don\u2019t love roasted cauliflower or cauliflower rice, but I\u2019ve discovered I absolutely love cauliflower when it\u2019s lightly battered and baked until the florets come out crackly and, when tossed in a gochujang glaze, just rich enough. These recipes define what it means for me to eat well\u2014to cook the way I want to feel\u2014and I hope you\u2019ll try them at home. Also, since getting COVID-19 now feels inevitable in this Omicron world, I\u2019d go ahead and bookmark this comforting chicken soup now.I also like using the new year as a totally arbitrary time to shake up my grocery shopping and fill my cart with produce I associate with the \u201cdeep winter,\u201d like juicy satsumas, collard greens, turnips, and sunchokes. I\u2019m poring over old and new favorite cookbooks and flagging all the recipes that will be bright spots during the darkest, coldest months of the year. On my reading list now:Fresh India by Meera Sodha for endless ideas for legumesDonabe by Naoko Takei Moore and Kyle Connaughton for reasons to keep my donabe on the stove at all times (and pray that Takei Moore\u2019s shop Toiro Kitchen restocks larger donabes soon because I am jonesing for an upgrade)Grist by Abra Berens for new ideas for old faithful grainsAt Home in the Whole Food Kitchen by Amy Chaplin for my favorite loaf of spelt and brown rice bread, which makes a truly superb avocado toastMother Grains by Roxana Jullapat for ideas on how to use up the one million whole grain flours left over from holiday cookie baking (buckwheat cake? Okay!)If you have a favorite comforting cookbook you like to revisit at the start of the new year, send it my way!Explore Bon App\u00e9titWhat's Chaey Cooking?CultureRecipes you want to make.
