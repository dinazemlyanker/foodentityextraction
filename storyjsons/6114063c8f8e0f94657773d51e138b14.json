The founder of beloved ultra-saturated brand Dusen Dusen is practically a professional maximalist, and her design sensibility is guaranteed to spark joy.\u00a0\u201cBringing in color makes me feel happy and at home,\u201d Van Dusen says. \u201cNot everyone has the same relationship with color, but fun little objects can really shift the whole mood of a room. It\u2019s an easy and noncommittal way to change things up.\u201d She sticks to white walls and neutral appliances to keep the little, colorful objects from being overshadowed, then decorates with aplomb. Here she outlines how she uses patterns, colors, and playful objects to lighten up her living space.Photograph by Laura MurrayUse every surfaceThat's not a print or painting above the mantle: Van Dusen used a dowel rod to hang this silk scarf from Massif Central, designed by painter Jonas Wood. \u201cMassif Central does limited, artist-edition scarves, so I have a couple that I\u2019ve bought from them over the years,\u201d she says. \u201cIt's a great way to \u2018buy the painting\u2019 if you can't afford a painting.\u201d\u201cI have gotten into having flowers during quarantine\u2014they make the room feel fresh and they\u2019re just pretty,\u201d says Van Dusen. The black and white striped vase from ceramicist Isabel Halley features a rotation of fresh and funky blooms from local shop Bohaus.Photograph by Laura MurrayPut it all on the table\u00a0One easy way to skip the monochrome look? Bring in color with trippy mismatched napkins. Van Dusen designed the full set of patterned textiles to mix and match without clashing. The stackable Heller plates were an eBay score!\u00a0Photograph by Laura MurrayGet a little silly\u201cI love this shark by my friend Lorien Stern,\u201d Van Dusen says. \u201cShe also painted my bathroom downstairs! We connected on the internet because we both love sharks and watermelons, and we\u2019ve become good friends since then.\u201dPhotograph by Laura MurrayMix and match (then mix some more)Van Dusen used broken tiles\u2014which are often salvaged when pieces break in the kiln and don\u2019t require additional cutting\u2014to cover the Victorian-era fireplace\u2019s original damaged tiling with a freeform mosaic inspired by artist Niki de Saint Phalle. Steal this trick to upgrade dowdy bathrooms or alcoves (but get permission if you\u2019re a renter).Stick to simple white walls to make a perfect canvas for hanging colorful objects. Sure, that Dali-esque resin clock by Italian architect and designer Gaetano Pesce is functional, but it\u2019s also fun.Shop Ellen Van Dusen's apartment:\u00a0Buy it: Tall Vase with Black and White Stripes, $165 at isabelhalley.comBuy it: Dusen Dusen Set of Four Napkins, $42Buy it: Watch Me Clock, $300Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish HomeTrendsRead MoreLifestyleHealthyish at Home: 7 Ways to Make Your Space Feel GreatBy The Healthyish TeamRecipes you want to make.
