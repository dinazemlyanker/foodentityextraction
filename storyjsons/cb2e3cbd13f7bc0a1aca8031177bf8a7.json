They\u2019re vegan, dairy-free, refined-sugar-free, and gluten-free (as long as you use gluten-free certified oats), and they come together in a food processor, which means minimal cleanup and no risk of overmixing. And while you don\u2019t have to add the chocolate chips, a bit of their sweet richness goes a long way. We think singer Jack Johnson would be proud.If you don\u2019t have a food processor, you can use 1 heaping cup (100 g) oat flour instead of the 1 cup (100 g) old-fashioned oats\u2014mash the banana well before stirring all of the ingredients together (including the \u00bc cup old-fashioned oats).This recipe is easily doubled to serve four. \u2014Sarah JampelAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Add to ground oats along with dairy-free milk, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, vanilla, and 3 Tbsp. oil. Process, stopping to scrape down sides as needed, until well combined. Remove bowl from base and stir chocolate chips (if using) and remaining \u00bc cup (29 g) oats into batter. Let sit 15 minutes; it should be slightly thickened.Step 3Meanwhile, thinly slice remaining banana and set aside.Step 4Heat 1 tsp. oil in a 10\" or 12\" nonstick skillet over medium-high, swirling to coat bottom of pan. Working in batches of 2 or 3, depending on the size of your pan and the confidence you have in flipping, scoop in about \u00bc cup batter per pancake and flatten slightly with a spatula. Arrange a few reserved banana slices on top, then reduce heat to medium, and cook until set and golden brown underneath, 2\u20133 minutes. Flip pancakes over and cook on other side until golden brown, 1\u20132 minutes. Transfer to a large plate. Repeat with remaining batter, adding more oil to pan between batches as needed.Step 5Serve pancakes topped with yogurt (if using) and maple syrup.How would you rate Vegan Banana-Oat Pancakes?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (12)Back to TopTriangleMichael--the yogurt as topping is what's optional :) :) :) also why does it matter, if you're vegan, make it veganAnonymousBoston MA2/28/2022I used only 1 tbsp of coconut oil in the batter and replaced the other 2 tbsps with applesauce. I did not add the 1/4 cup raw oats and extra banana to the batter because I like my pancakes smooth. I also added 1/2 tsp of cardamom. It turned out perfect.Anonymous1/29/2022How is dairy-free alternatives 'optional' if this is a Vegan recipe? Adding anything not vegan kinda defeats the point of the title of this recipe. Soya yogurt and dairy free chocolate is easy to find and cheap nowadays!\nOtherwise was very tasty, works well with shredded oats too, would recommend slow and stead heat for best results especially not to burn the chocolate! Keep up the vegan recipes please!Michael Boston, MA1/29/2022Trying to eat a more plant-based diet but I love a hearty weekend breakfast. These were great! Absolutely hit the spot. Did not add chocolate chips \u2014 they were sweet enough for me as-is and the texture was very good. Topped with a bit of PB for extra protein. Yum!AnonymousDriggs, Idaho1/23/2022@SCOTT S Yes, I would recommend 100 grams of oat flour. You might have to add a little more to get the right consistency, but that's a good place to start!Sarah Jampel1/19/2022I made these for my 2 daughters as they are pancake lovers and they liked them. I also tried them as well and are tasty. Very customizable as well. I'll definitely make again.GessBaytown, TX1/18/2022These turned out pretty well, but I used 2 tbsp oil instead of 3 and it was still quite oily. I might even use 1 tbsp next time. Anonymous1/18/2022Mediocre recipe. If you use a 1/4 cup scoop per pancake, it will not make 8 pancakes. They stick to the spatula when you try to flatten them and if the pan is very hot, the chocolate chips burn easily. Overall, the pancakes are too thick and take a long time to cook inside resulting in a much darker outside than the one shown in the image . The texture is also nothing to write home about. All in all, nothing exciting.Tatti KIrvine, CA1/18/2022Great recipe!  If you are using oat flour (rather than using oats that you grind yourself), how much would you recommend we use?  Still 100 grams worth?Scott SLos Angeles, CA1/18/2022My first batch stuck horribly to the pan. Maybe it was the very ripe banana? I baked the rest of the batter in a baking dish in the oven. The flavor is great and I will try again.BethGrand Rapids, Michigan 1/17/2022These are great for brunch. Easy to prep but I think you lose a lot even when scraping the blender because it's not super runny. Probably will transfer mixed oats and mix with hand mixer of I make it again. Super easy to customise too.Camille K.France1/16/2022Made these this morning! So quick and easy - and they actually taste delicious. Highly recommend if you\u2019re in the mood for pancakes, gluten free eater or not!MeighanNew York1/15/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titBreakfastEasyQuickVeganVegetarianDairy-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreePancakeBananaFruitOatRice & GrainsRecipes you want to make.
