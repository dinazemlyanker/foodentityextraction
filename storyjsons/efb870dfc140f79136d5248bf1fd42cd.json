Sure, you might say I\u2019m biased because I\u2019m from Taiwan. But it\u2019s not just in my head: Billions of people across the world celebrate the Lunar New Year. And with hundreds of millions of them returning home to visit their families, it\u2019s one of the planet\u2019s largest human migrations.The beauty of the Lunar New Year is that many cultures, from Malaysia to Korea to Vietnam to Tibet to China, celebrate it in their own unique way. While I might not be an expert on how every group celebrates this special holiday, I have celebrated the Taiwanese Lunar New Year more than 20 times.In Taiwan the rituals and traditions revolve around welcoming the new year and spending time with family. There are clear rules for what to do each day, whether that\u2019s decorating spring couplets\u2014propitious verses, written in black or gold ink on red paper, that express luck in the year to come\u2014the day before the new year; wishing each other good fortune (we say \u201cwish you get rich\u201d as a greeting); staying up past midnight on New Year\u2019s Eve (the literal translation for this practice is \u201cguarding the year\u201d); or wearing new clothes. And of course, a big festive meal is an essential part of the holiday.While it might be challenging\u2014if not impossible\u2014to host a large meal for a crowd this year, I think we can still find ways to celebrate and pay tribute to the traditions. My mini-but-festive menu fills my diaspora stomach with nostalgia, bringing a little Taipei to New York for me\u2014I hope it brings joy to your table.The riceFirst up is youfan, my favorite rice dish of all time. This Taiwanese sticky rice specialty is enjoyed on special occasions, like when a baby turns one month old. It\u2019s got a satisfyingly dense texture and is usually flavored with umami-intense ingredients. My version is made with fried ginger, dried mushrooms, dried shrimp, black sesame oil, fried shallots, rice wine, and soy sauce. Everything gets steamed together in one bowl so that the glutinous rice can absorb all the delicious flavors. To make this dish vegan and gluten-free, omit the shrimp and seek out gluten-free soy sauce.Mushroom YouFan (Taiwanese Sticky Rice)This deeply savory (and vegan!) take on Taiwanese youfan will make a gorgeous addition to any Lunar New Year feast.View RecipeThe mainFor the main dish I\u2019m making something traditional: steamed whole fish. What you cook and eat on Lunar New Year\u2019s Eve is all about auspicious puns, and the whole fish is a classic example. It symbolizes excess fortune for the year because the word fish in Mandarin sounds the same as the word for \u201cexcess.\u201d And who doesn\u2019t want to carry over extra fortune into the coming year?But since it can be challenging to steam a whole fish at home (you need a big pan and some bulky equipment), I opt for a smaller fish. And my twist is that I steam it directly on a bed of aromatics (in this case, onions, scallions, and ginger) rather than on a plate set atop a rack. The result is an excellent whole fish that checks off the prosper-pun box, plus incredibly saucy vegetables to serve it with.Jessie\u2019s Special Steamed Whole FishA showstopping whole fish is a Lunar New Year staple. Assistant food editor Jessie YuChen\u2019s version is straightforward yet stunning, doesn\u2019t require any special equipment, and did we mention it\u2019s absolutely delicious?View RecipeThe greensWe can\u2019t have a proper dinner without some greens, and I love this tasty cucumber salad from chef Justin Lee of Fat Choy. It adds the necessary freshness to the spread, and it\u2019s a simple side dish everyone loves.Smashed Cucumber SaladThis refreshing, saucy cucumber salad will cool you down all summer and is fun to make with kids in the kitchen.View RecipeThe sweetFinally, let\u2019s end the meal with something sweet: mochi-stuffed jujubes, or as we call them in Taiwan, \u5fc3\u592a\u8edf soft hearts. It\u2019s a beautiful dessert in which dried jujubes\u2014a common ingredient in East Asian desserts and herbalism\u2014are filled with balls of glutinous rice flour dough, then simmered in (and doused with) a simple syrup infused with dried osmanthus flowers. The fruity, woodsy aroma of the jujubes pairs with the floral, honeyed syrup, and their dense, spongy texture complements the chewy mochi.Mochi-Stuffed Jujubes (Soft Hearts)These mochi-stuffed jujube dates in syrup are the Lunar New Year dessert that\u2019s (almost) too adorable to eat.View RecipeThis dessert is also my own attempt at an auspicious pun for the next year: We all went through challenging times over the past couple of years, and I hope we can soften our hearts and treat each other gently in the next year. My wish is that we can be like soft mochi, easily bent but too stretchy to break.Explore Bon App\u00e9titcookingLunar New YearRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
