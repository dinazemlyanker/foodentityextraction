It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Ch-ch-ch-chimichurriSo much better than a Chia Pet. We had an \u201canalytics\u201d meeting this week and discovered that one of the most popular recipes on the site that readers find through Google is this classic chimichurri sauce. I have big plans to make it this weekend to accompany all of these steaks my great aunt froze that are currently thawing just for me. Family! We\u2019re going to grill them and douse in this parsley-packed chimichurri because I have no idea how long they\u2019ve been in that freezer.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Photo by Peden + MunkTime\u2019s running OUT!This is the time of late summer we all feel a sudden urge to cook like crazy. Produce comes and goes so fast you wonder if you really ate enough rhubarb (you didn\u2019t). This roundup of the staff\u2019s summer bucket list recipes got me extra intrigued about these grilled clams\u2014cooked in a cast iron on the grill with a brothy tomato sauce to dip (grilled) bread in. See the whole bucket list here.Speaking of overripe produce on your counterDid you see this launch this week?Via PaneraWhat is this?Panera announced a Double Bread Bowl option for Philly locations and it makes me want to punch my fists into the warm soup and wear it as a muff.A must-read interviewWith cookbook author Virginia Willis:\u201cI don\u2019t want people to look at the news and see those angry faces and Dixie flags in Charlottesville, Virginia and think everyone in the south is like that. I know this is a cookbook, but this cookbook is the way I can express that.\u201dClaire\u2019s biggest successRecreating Oreos\u2014to a T. She did it! The journey is something to behold. Watching Claire succeed fills my heart with warmth and joy, or maybe that\u2019s all the Oreos in my arteries. There\u2019s a cameo in the episode of our beloved mail manager, Gary, who has to deliver packages of dairy-free cashewgurt and other bulky press mail day-in and day-out and yet he\u2019s never not smiling. Gary tried to avoid the camera, but they came right toward him. \u201cIt tasted just like the real thing,\u201d he told me. Watch it here.SURPRISE MAILThen Gary had a surprise package for me. A secret admirer sent me a bulk box of 36 Cow Tales, my favorite candy ever. They\u2019re long, soft caramel tails with a cream filling that dissolves in your mouth as you chew chew chew like a cow in deep thought. This is the BEST DAY OF MY LIFE.What\u2019s up, unnecessary food feud of the weekChicken butts. An unnamed staffer confessed that she hard-boiled some eggs in the same pot she was making lentils. \u201cIs that okay?\u201d She asked. \u201cOr is it gross because the egg...came out of the chicken\u2019s....\u201d Cloaca. That\u2019s the hole the egg (and everything else, sorry to inform you) comes out of. And sure, it might land in some coop poop but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s cleaned off by the time it gets to your kitchen, plus just rinse it?! Everyone agreed that multitasking boiling eggs while cooking other things is fine. It\u2019s FINE. We didn\u2019t really feud over this so much as spend 11 minutes talking about chicken butts.
