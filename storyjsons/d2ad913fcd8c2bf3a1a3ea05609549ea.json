Food Styling by Pearl JonesFacebookTwitterEmailThis is\u00a0All on the Table, a column featuring writers we love sharing stories of food, conflict, and community.It was my job to trim the ruffled edges off the boiled lasagna sheets. My mother\u2014a cook so particular she once remade the chicken at a friend\u2019s dinner party because it looked \u201ctoo pale\u201d\u2014does not abide by anything but straight-edged pasta. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to get an even texture,\u201d she\u2019d say, and that was important when it came to lasagna de carne, the centerpiece of our family\u2019s annual New Year\u2019s Eve feast.\u00a0From a young age I considered cooking to be Mami\u2019s domain and hers alone. Oh, I\u2019d chop beets for the ensalada rusa and grate carrots for the macaroni salad, but I was just following orders until she turned her back and I could return to my novels and video games.Every New Year\u2019s Eve my father would buy almonds and chestnuts, a well-worn nutcracker at the ready. There would be ice-cold beers and Manischewitz, his preferred holiday wine. With Mami\u2019s alchemy filling the air\u2014garlicky tomatoes smothered in bubbly cheese\u2014we\u2019d begin getting ready. Hair in rollers, button-down shirts, a family of pomp and circumstance even if the only place we\u2019d party was our tiny two-bedroom in Morningside Heights. We greeted the new year as a unit: eyes on the TV, incense in the air, stomachs full.Then came New Year\u2019s Eve 2009. The year we unbecame who we\u2019d been.\u00a0Back home in New York for winter break, I was with a few sorority sisters when my eldest sibling called: My brother Rob was in the hospital. He\u2019d had another episode.For over a year we\u2019d all watched as Rob struggled. He\u2019d become silent. Fascinated with dark rooms. Full of angry, baseless accusations. He was never violent, but harm comes in many forms. Doctors from New York-Presbyterian told us that they believed it was paranoid schizophrenia.We are a Dominican-ass family, quite superstitious. Pennies on our foreheads to stop nosebleeds. Sacraments to guarantee entry to heaven. My mother still strongly believes dreams tell us when someone\u2019s going to die. But we had no experience dealing with mental health.My parents called 911 on December 30. I joined them at the hospital, then went home while they handled the paperwork. The kitchen was in disarray; Mami had been preparing beef for the lasagna when things got hectic. She\u2019d managed to get it into the fridge, but that was all.I don\u2019t know why I did it. We did not have much to celebrate. There were no chestnuts, no music. Perhaps I thought the only thing holding us loosely together was the idea of a better day, a better decade, better care that might result in better health for a beloved. Perhaps I just wanted to scramble toward normal, grasp onto a bit of comfort and routine. So I tried to remember the basic steps: the boiling, the removal of crinkles, the vamping up of jarred tomato sauce. The layers and layers. Alone, I stacked my grief. I cooked through tears. By the time my mother returned from the hospital, I was elbow deep in ground beef.Standing by the door she watched me with unseeing eyes. So I asked for advice\u2014just to say something, to coax her into familiarity. I asked about the base and she told me to add cilantrico. She talked me through pur\u00e9eing the garlic. She told me to put un poquito de salsa de tomate here, to make sure the last layer had a perfect capa of mozzarella.Some time before midnight my father turned on the TV. I wore jeans, pomp and circumstance forgotten. Maybe Mami had on lipstick, but I doubt it. I couldn\u2019t tell you if the lasagna tasted good, or if I tasted it at all. I do remember not having mastered the ability to cook ground meat without clumps and that it showed in my layers. But my mother ate her serving without critique\u2026or recooking. Then she packed some in Tupperware to take to my brother.Watching a relay race I\u2019m always drawn to the moment when the two racers run side by side. That second before the baton gets passed is magical: liminality suspended, a seamless dance begun, letting someone else do the sprinting while you catch your breath. New Year\u2019s Eve wasn\u2019t supposed to be a metaphor, but there we were: me holding my hand over my mother\u2019s and a big metal spoon, breathing deeply and encouraging each other to hold on, to keep stirring. There was a new decade to greet, and despite the heaviness we carried as we entered it, we would need to be well-fed.Get the Recipe:Mam\u00e1 Rosa\u2019s Lasagna de CarneThe secret to lasagna de carne that packs a wallop of flavor?
