The 31-year-old Harlem-based Adeoso is not only a digital collage artist but also the co-owner of Teranga, a New York City-based African fast-casual restaurant and community gathering place.Born in Abeokuta, Nigeria, Adeoso grew up in Canada then moved to New York City during her senior year of high school, which was when her creative direction truly started to form. \u201cI was in a band and took my first web/graphic design class. I found myself waiting for my mom to go to bed so that I could stay up and code my BlackPlanet and Myspace pages and make digital collages on Photoshop.\u201dWhen you ask Adeoso to describe what she does now, her answer is simple: \u201cI make things happen.\u201d Like her dream of paying homage to her culture through food come true. \u201cFor me, African food as always been personal. Eating at Teranga is as delicious as it is educational.\u201dDespite being incredibly busy, Adeoso still puts in serious effort to ground and care for herself each night. Reading art magazines that she picks up at McNally Jackson Books, listening to disco music, and surrounding herself with like-minded folks well into the evening are all a part of her routine. Keep reading to find out what songs help her unwind and the linen spray she swears by for a restful sleep.Nothing de-stresses like a really good stretch.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanStretch it outMy days are pretty jam-packed, especially since opening Teranga, so it\u2019s really important that I slow down each evening once I come home. I\u2019m on my feet for most of the day, so yoga and stretching really help me unwind. You can also find me dancing around my apartment a lot of nights. Moving helps to clear my mind while getting in a bit of exercise before bed.Stress less, disco moreI\u2019m really into groovy music, even in the evenings, which I know sounds contradictory. I recently curated Teranga FM\u2019s Vol. 2 (Disco Inferno) playlist on Spotify, and it\u2019s a compilation of some of the best disco music to come out of Africa during the 1970s and early 80s. I\u2019ll often put this on when I come home from a long day to help me forget about the day\u2019s stress.Cooking as therapyMost Saturday nights are spent working at Teranga, but if I\u2019m home I\u2019ll most likely have on music and be cooking. My favorite Nigerian dish to make is a spinach stew called Efo Riro with Eba, which is a fufu made from pounded cassava. I usually make this for my family, since it really reminds me of home.Mixing a homemade turmeric mask\nPhoto by Emma FishmanNatural skin care or bustMy evening skincare routine is a time for me to pause, slow down from my busy day, and wash it all away. Right now, I\u2019m transitioning out most of my previous skin care products for natural ones.I really like Herbivore Botanicals. Their Moon Fruit Superfruit Night Treatment is a leave-on treatment cream that I am obsessed with because it\u2019s perfect for gentle overnight exfoliation plus it smells amazing! I also love making my own masks, like Baobab and Turmeric.Power down to power upBefore going to bed I like to smoke an Indica strain of cannabis to help me power down from the day. Right now, I\u2019m into mixing with other flowers. Barbari's herbal blend is my favorite! Because I don\u2019t know how to roll, I usually use my Laundry Day pipe if no one\u2019s around to help me.I\u2019m also really into using CBD, in all its forms, to help me unwind in the evenings. In fact, I recently switched my melatonin for Gossamer's Dusk night time CBD. I also swear by CBD bath bombs, which I pick up from Poplar, to help with achy joints and sore muscles.Linen spray for better sleepThe one thing I do each night before hopping into bed is I spray our sheets with a homemade linen spray. I started making my own spray, a mixture of rose water and lemongrass essential oil, and it\u2019s made a huge difference in how we sleep. I honestly can\u2019t recommend it enough.Sipping a turmeric seltzer before bed.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanExplore Bon App\u00e9titGoing to Bed withHealthyishprofileRead MoreLifestyleWhipped Cream and Cricket Sounds Help Chani Nicholas Fall AsleepBy Kristin BraswellRecipes you want to make.
