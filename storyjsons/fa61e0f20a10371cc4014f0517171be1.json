It\u2019s both visually striking and startlingly deep in flavor, and as far as most cakes go, it\u2019s fairly make-ahead friendly. Since cakes with whipped cream filling always need to be refrigerated, using chiffon cake\u2014which uses oil, not butter\u2014is a strategic choice as the layers will remain soft and tender even straight out of the fridge. (Butter-based cakes, on the other hand, seem hard and leaden after a stint in the cold.) The whipped cream, which is flavored with freeze-dried raspberries and dotted with whole fruit, stays stable for a few days. Be sure to use ungreased regular (not nonstick) cake pans so that the batter can cling to the sides and rise tall as it bakes.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt\u00bccup (80 g) raspberry jam2cups (170 g) fresh raspberriesSpecial equipmentA pastry bag and a \u00bd\"-diameter tipPreparationCakeStep 1Position a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0. Line two 8\"-diameter cake pans with parchment paper rounds (do not grease). Beat egg whites, salt, cream of tartar, and \u00bd cup (100 g) sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on medium-low speed until egg whites are broken up, about 30 seconds. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until meringue is glossy and holds firm peaks, 8\u201310 minutes.Step 2Whisk egg yolks and remaining \u00bd cup (100 g) sugar by hand in a large bowl until pale and well combined, about 2 minutes. Whisk in oil, vanilla, and \u2153 cup room-temperature water. Sift flour and baking powder over and whisk vigorously to combine.Step 3Add one fourth of meringue to egg yolk mixture and mix thoroughly to incorporate (this will lighten the batter). Add remaining meringue in 3 batches, gently folding after each addition until only a few streaks of meringue remain (err on the side of mixing slightly less rather than more to keep batter billowy).Step 4Divide batter evenly between prepared pans and gently smooth surface. Bake cakes 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325\u00b0 and continue baking until golden brown and tops spring back when gently pressed, 35\u201340 minutes more. Remove from oven; invert pans onto a wire rack. Let cakes cool in pans (cooling them upside down reduces shrinkage), 60\u201370 minutes. Turn cakes over and run an offset spatula around sides of cakes to loosen, then invert cakes onto wire rack. Peel away parchment.AssemblyStep 5Finely grind sugar and 1\u00bd cups (37 g) freeze-dried raspberries in a spice mill or food processor (if using food processor, sift powder through a fine-mesh sieve after to remove seeds). Transfer to the clean bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment; add cream, vanilla, and salt and beat on medium-high speed until firm peaks form, 5\u20137 minutes.Step 6Stir jam in a small bowl to loosen, then gently fold in fresh raspberries.Step 7Place 1 cake on a cake platter or large plate. Scoop a heaping cupful of raspberry cream on top; spread evenly with offset spatula. Spoon berry mixture on top of cream, leaving a 1\" border around the edges (this will prevent berries from spilling over the sides). Place second cake layer on top. Spoon a heaping \u00bd cup raspberry cream into pastry bag fitted with tip. Frost top and sides of cake with raspberry cream still in bowl, then pipe dollops of raspberry cream around edges of top of cake. Chill cake, uncovered, at least 2 hours.Step 8To serve, sprinkle top of cake with crushed freeze-dried raspberries if desired. Slice cake with a serrated knife, wiping clean between cuts.Do ahead: Cake can be baked 1 day ahead; store tightly wrapped at room temperature, or freeze up to 1 week. If frozen, thaw in refrigerator overnight before using. Cake (without crushed raspberry topping) can be assembled 1 day ahead; cover loosely and chill.How would you rate Raspberry Cake With Whipped Cream Filling?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkExplore Bon App\u00e9titDessertLayer CakeCakeNut-FreeBakingRaspberryBerryFruitRecipes you want to make.
