Or actually, don\u2019t. Picture my ideal doughnut. It\u2019s a cake version, dense but not too dense. There is a clear delineation between the almost crunchy crust and the tender, lightly-spiced interior. It\u2019s tossed in cinnamon sugar, so it\u2019s sweet but not overpowered by some gloopy glaze.That perfectly describes the Dirt Bomb from Bantam Bread in Bantam, Connecticut, except\u2014plot twist!\u2014my ideal doughnut is actually shaped like a muffin. I don\u2019t know why exactly, but I do know that means there\u2019s plenty of the moist nutmeg-flecked insides to go around. This is the breakfast I look forward to every time I visit my parents, the treat I share with friends when they come too, the thing those same friends ask for on return visits.It\u2019s just one of the many wonderful offerings at Bantam Bread, which has been making excellent breads since before it became very cool to make excellent breads (try the sunflower-flax!). And though I really hope you\u2019ll make a trip, if you can\u2019t, I have good news: They shared their recipe with us, which means that my ideal doughnut-ish thing can now be your ideal doughnut-ish thing, no matter where you live.Go there: Bantam BreadExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendDoughnutConnecticutRead MorerestaurantsI\u2019ll Take Granny Rye Over Bread Bro Sourdough Any DayBy Amiel StanekRecipes you want to make.
