The filling features tart and juicy blackberries, as well as dried apricots rendered soft and chewy by rehydrating in wine. (Using dried helps control excess juiciness, preventing the crust from becoming soggy.)All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Brush egg on exposed dough around filling, then lay remaining rectangle of dough over. Seal dough by pressing edges together with a fork.

The vanilla completely overpowered the fruit. As a consequence the flavor was off putting and a waist of  both my time and the fruit!!!John GuthrieSan Carlos CA10/12/2021I make slab pies all the time and have been making them for years, you can use any combination of fruit you like. Some great ones to try: apples and berries, stone fruit and berries, sour cherry.  To ensure correct sweetness, taste your fruit and then add sugar according to taste, always add fresh butter dotted over your fruit, and to ensure no soggy bottoms, add a little flour or cornstarch to your fruit - more if it's really wet after sitting for 10-15 minutes, less if not too wet after it sits. You can add all kinds of fun spices to your fruit too, I like cardamom with stone fruit, cinnamon and lime zest with sour cherries, cinnamon and ginger with apples. Experiment and have fun, your guests and family will be grateful you made them a pie! Bianca 4SOakland, CA8/8/2021The recipe worked beautifully, but I didn't love the dried apricots. They tasted great when the pie was fresh out of the oven, but the next day got very chewy and overly sweet. I'm going to try to make this with different fruit.RachelFL8/4/2021Yes, you can use other fruit.  We used half the apricots, and blueberries and raspberries fresh off the stem. We hated the giant pop-tart idea, and used a big tart pan instead of a rectangle.  Result: a giant circular pop-tart.  But very good eating!AnonymousMilwaukee, but cooking today in Vermont.7/29/2021Can other fresh or frozen fruit be used to make this?MelAlbany,OR7/26/2021Just wondering: \nNext time, couldn't I divide the dough, roll out the pieces to the same dimensions, and cut into sections that could lie atop each other and make little sealed pies?  ( I sometimes \"cook\" with a ruler so my pieces would be \"pairs.\") \nAnonymousCharlotte, NC USA7/26/2021Just don\u2019t care for blackberries. Can you think of substitution that would end up with same consistency and no soggy bottom? GayPhiladelphia 7/25/20211/2 cup sugar isn't enough. 1 cup or more makes a world of difference!Monica7/21/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titPieDessertAmericanDried ApricotDried FruitFruitBlackberryBerrySummerEasyNut-FreeBakingRecipes you want to make.
