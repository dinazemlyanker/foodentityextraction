Daikon brings a pleasant sweetness to the broth\u2014it\u2019s so juicy and soft when done right\u2014while beef contributes richness and depth. To make this soup, you\u2019ll start with bone-in short ribs, separating the meat from the bones and browning both with aromatics to build deep caramelized flavor. Then you\u2019ll deglaze the pot with rice wine and cook everything down with added spices. The end result is a comforting soup brimming with cubes of fall-apart beef and super tender daikon that will get you through the last leg of winter. \u2014Jessie YuChenAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I much prefer ph\u1edf. soy23stolen Catawba land3/19/2022It turns out very delicious! I made a mistake buying flanken style beef short ribs and I don't have MSG so I use 1 tbsp of beef base Better than Bouillon instead. I crank up the heat a bit with more white pepper and dash of pepper flakes. Maybe next time I'll add two or three Thai chili when cooking the onion to add some kick.PatarSeattle, WA2/28/2022An easy super flavorful weeknight stew, reminiscent of \u2018Pho\u2019. If you want to make it heartier, serve over kelp, shirataki, or rice noodles. So delicious! Laura M.
