I drizzle it over a mix of greens and whatever I\u2019m into\u2014tomatoes, beets, nuts.\u201d Mix it up to make it your own. But don\u2019t start to heat the oil until all of the chaas seasonings are measured out and close at hand; blooming the spices goes quickly.Ingredients8 servingsDressing1cup buttermilk2Tbsp. vegetable oil5dried chiles de \u00e1rbol, lightly crushed, seeds removed if desired4curry leaves1tsp. cumin seeds\u00bdtsp. brown mustard seedsKosher saltSalad and Assembly1bunch red and/or French Breakfast radishes, trimmed, thinly sliced3heads of Little Gem lettuce, torn crosswise into 2\"-wide strips1small cucumber, thinly sliced\u00bdcup fresh English peas, sugar snap peas, and/or 1\u00bd\"-long pieces green and/or wax beans1sprig mint, leaves torn2Tbsp. finely chopped cilantroKosher salt (optional)PreparationDressingStep 1Pour buttermilk into a measuring glass or small bowl.
