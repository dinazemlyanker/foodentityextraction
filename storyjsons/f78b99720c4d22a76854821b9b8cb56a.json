The rest of MoMA PS1 may be all brick and concrete\u2014after all, the contemporary art museum in Queens, NY was once an elementary school \u2014but Mina\u2019s, a Greek-inspired restaurant that opened in November, is  a mint-and-magenta oasis within its walls.Like Flora Bar (below the Met Breur on the Upper East Side) and Otium (next to The Broad in downtown L.A.), Mina\u2019s is the latest museum restaurant to assert itself as a dining destination in its own right\u2014no museum admission required. There are no pre-wrapped egg salad sandwiches here. Instead, there\u2019s a Mediterranean-accented menu from Mina Stone, who has transitioned to feeding art lovers after years of working as a personal in-studio chef for the artist Urs Fischer and art dealer Gavin Brown. (Stone\u2019s 2015 cookbook, Cooking for Artists, has found a rabid fan base among art and food lovers alike.)\u201cI'm out of my safe world of people who have eaten my food before,\u201d Stone says with a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so exciting about the museum: I\u2019m opened up to the world\u2014the young, old, tourists, New Yorkers, whoever it might be.\u201dStone is drawn to pops of joy, like this colorful plumage.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanA proudly self-described \u201chome cook,\u201d Stone says she never planned on opening a restaurant of her own. But when she was approached by Peter Eleey, MoMA PS1\u2019s chief curator, to take over the cafe previously occupied by M. Wells Dinette, the idea stuck. Stone\u2019s husband, artist Alex Eagleton, worked with designer Isobel Herbold to channel their shared Greek heritage without relying on taverna kitsch, instead creating a \u201cvisually calm respite\u201d from the heavy themes explored in the surrounding classroom-sized galleries.The result is a museum cafe born of the all-day caf\u00e9 era, serving up obligatory (and welcome) glasses of natural wine alongside Stone\u2019s signature comfort food: lentil soup jolted with lemon juice, gooey slabs of tahini babka, white anchovies swimming in very good olive oil, and high-octane ouzo, all delivered by waiters with art school haircuts in gothic gingham track pants (a gift from Stone\u2019s fashion school friend, womenswear designer Adam Selman.) Here, Stone and Eagleton share the origins of the Greek-ish elements that give Mina\u2019s its distinct sense of place.Photo by Emma FishmanIt\u2019s all about the snacksStone: Our small plates are based on mezzetaki, which is something you do in the late afternoon in Greece\u2014you have some ouzo and sit on the beach, and the kitchen brings you out these little snacks with toothpicks. We have pickled cucumbers and carrots, whipped feta, muhammara, white anchovies, Greek sausage, and olives with cracked coriander. The Greek sausage we get from a butcher in Astoria who makes them all on-site. Alex and I go to Astoria all the time because there\u2019s a supermarket called Titan that has all the delicious Greek feta\u2014it\u2019s the Greek megastore of New York. This butcher shop has lambs hanging in the window; it\u2019s one of the butcher shops Americans would be pretty freaked out by.Photo by Emma FishmanTahini babka that\u2019s also French toastStone: The tahini walnut babka is something I developed with Natasha Price, the chef de cuisine. She\u2019s a really talented cook and baker and she worked so hard to make that recipe work. Putting the tahini walnut mixture in a babka dough is like my two cultures coming together, because my dad is a Jew from Cleveland and my mom is Greek. On the weekends, we\u2019re toasting it up into French toast putting Greek yogurt and fruit compote on it.Photo by Emma FishmanOlive oil as restaurant merchEagleton: I grew up spending my summers on Paros. The way the Greek olive oil thing tends to happen is that every family has x amount of olives, and they get them pressed at the town mill. It\u2019s not usually for sale, but with the crisis, people started selling some of their oil. I have an old friend on Paros who puts his oil together with a couple other guys, so I was like, \u2018Can you get me a thousand kilos?\u201dOnce the oil leaves the mill, it has to get tested and approved by an FDA-approved lab before you can bring it into the country, so I basically had to hustle the guy to get all those approvals included in the price I was negotiating, and he handled the shipping for me as well. A van came and dropped it off at the museum, and now we\u2019re storing it in the basement and selling some limited-run bottles to customers. Urs Fischer designed the label. We\u2019re not going to become oil rich off it, but it\u2019s another type of merch that makes sense for us. A nice Christmas gift, if you will.Photo by Emma FishmanKick back in the magenta mood lightingStone: If you go to Greece, these chairs are everywhere\u2014Alex has some at his project space there. They\u2019re meant for sitting in for hours because there\u2019s a big outdoor cinema culture in Greece, especially in the summertime. It ended up being cheaper for us to get custom chairs made in Greece and shipped over here than to get the basic chairs on Webstaurant. I feel like the mint green has both a Greek summer vibe and a Miami vibe, which I like.Eagleton: If you go to Astoria, you see that lighting game. If you go to a Greek American establishment, they\u2019re going to put some columns it in and change the lights around the columns.Stone: It\u2019s a little bit of a club vibe.Eagleton: And you gotta sneak Mykonos into the mix with the clubby lighting. We play around with the color but the magenta looks best with the rest of the room and it brings back our original mood board, which was a hybrid of Miami and Athens thirty years ago. It\u2019s a nod to hot-weather countries, and it definitely helps lighten the mood. It\u2019s calming while energizing, and we honestly just felt it would be fun.Explore Bon App\u00e9titGreekNew YorkHealthyishRead MoreLifestyleArtist Nadia Gohar Calms Her \u201cStudio Brain\u201d with Fennel Tea and Soft PJsBy Kyle BeecheyRecipes you want to make.
