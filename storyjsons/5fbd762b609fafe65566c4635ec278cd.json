Del Mar celebrates Maria\u2019s Spanish heritage and the traditions from their island home in Mallorca. Bring on the authentic flavors of Spain with a focus on incredibly fresh seafood including tapas, raw bar, charcoal grilled fish, seafood stews, and a variety of rice dishes.

High on our favorites list is the hyper-local A Rake\u2019s Progress featuring James Beard Award\u2013winning Baltimore chef Spike Gjerde\u2019s farm-focused cuisine. With prestige ingredients sourced from Mid-Atlantic farms and waters, Chef Spike takes diners on a journey of culinary terroir.
