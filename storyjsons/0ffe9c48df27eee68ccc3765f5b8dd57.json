Writing an 800-word love poem to your favorite smoked trout, canned tuna, or luxury anchovies is a rite of passage for our editors, a ritual that concludes with Test Kitchen manager Gaby Melian bestowing a key to the secret conservas closet on the fortunate inductee. (I await my invitation, Gaby!)If you're not yet among the converted, now, with trips to the fish counter limited, is the time to embrace these shelf-stable small bois. Not only are they delicious, but also they're packed with omega-3s and good-for-you vitamins and minerals. Plus, as far as seafood goes, anchovies, sardines, mackerel, and other little fellas are among the most sustainable options. If tinned fish really aren't your thing, we've thrown in a couple of our favorite smoked fish options too; they won't last forever, but they'll keep in your fridge longer than the fresh stuff.All products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
