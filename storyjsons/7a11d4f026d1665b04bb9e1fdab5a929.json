It hints at where hospitality is going: to a place so comfortable and cozy we might soon expect a bedtime story.By Alex BeggsSeptember 19, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailCozy up with the blankets at Lazy Betty in Atlanta.Photo by Shannon ColeFacebookTwitterEmailIn this fantasy you are wearing a buttery silk slip muumuu at a restaurant in Aspen, when your arms begin tickling with goosebumps as the sun sets. Suddenly, a striped wool blanket appears. Now this, this is hospitality! Or where it may be leading: To a place so comfortable, so cozy, so thoughtful, you might never want to go home\u2014where the blankets are nubby and threadbare.In cities known for having more than one season, you can find restaurant blankets draped on the backs of chairs or rolled into antique milk crates. Once you start noticing them, you\u2019ll never stop. I first encountered actually in-use restaurant blankets in the high altitude Andes mountains where Mil is located in Peru. There, where the temperatures drop and the breeze hits straight to the bone, diners wrap blue-gray throws made of impossibly soft baby alpaca (woven by local artisans) around their shoulders. And those blankets can keep you warm forever and ever\u2014they\u2019re for sale to support the restaurant\u2019s research team.In mostly warm Atlanta, Lazy Betty has lightweight pastel throws for guests who might walk through wandering ghosts. (You never know!) In mostly cold Aspen, you can snap up a preppy custom wool blanket made by famed parka designer Woolrich for the cabin-y restaurant Clark\u2019s. In temperate Austin, the Launderette team buys gray blankets from a military surplus store, cuts them in half, and re-hems them. Crafty! And is that a 100 percent brushed-cotton Sferra Celine throw draped over the chairs at Angler in San Francisco? Expect no less!There\u2019s much to admire about a restaurant so considerate of a guest\u2019s comfort. The hospitality is warmer than a mug of hot chocolate. And at Olmsted in Brooklyn, you can get that too, along with a colorful Pendleton blanket. But it\u2019s about more than that.Swaddle me in these blankets (clockwise from top left): Angler, The Wolf\u2019s Tailor, Clark\u2019s, and Lazy Betty\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigFrom a design perspective the blankets can soften a space that might otherwise feel stuffy or pretentious, especially if it\u2019s a tasting menu spot. That\u2019s why chef Ronald Hsu brought pale pink and mustard-yellow H&M throws into Lazy Betty\u2014\u201cto allow you to get really cozy,\u201d he says. Sure, a guest walked away wearing one as a shawl on the restaurant\u2019s opening night, but they brought it back.I talked to Angler\u2019s director of operations, Maxfield Schnee, for over 30 minutes about blankets. \u201cI\u2019m the blanket guy,\u201d he said by introduction. Picture Linus, but with a $97 throw in herringbone stitch plus tassels. At the impeccably designed Bay Area restaurant, the blankets cushion the diner\u2019s back while they sit when they aren\u2019t in active use. \u201cChef is hyper, hyper, hyper aware of the guest experience,\u201d Schnee said. \u201cEven the parts the guest is not aware they\u2019re experiencing.\u201d (Emphasis mine.)Finding the right blanket was as overthought and obsessed-over as the menu, and the lamps, and the chairs: \u201cWe went through a number of samples,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a fun time for a freak like myself. We tested them in the same conditions as the guests, at the tables in chairs, in every area,\u201d say, if you\u2019re seated under the A/C vent. \u201cSome weren\u2019t soft enough, some didn\u2019t suit the look when draped on the back of the chair, some were warm but itchy.\u201d Until they found The One. The Celine.The blankets represent more than a physical need, noted Schnee, but something subconscious, something you lean back on without noticing. \u201cIt\u2019s simply there to increase the joy and comfort level in the everyday.\u201dThis gets back to my theory about hospitality. There\u2019s a home direction we\u2019re headed in (don\u2019t make me say \u201chygge\u201d) that has intimate, maternal associations. But it\u2019s the mythic, kid\u2019s book version of home\u2014being tucked in, being fed soup on a spoon that zooms toward your mouth like an airplane\u2014not the reality we escape when we flee the house seeking dinner, or hell, a new life, elsewhere. Take care of me, I surrender, we say to the blanket. But you\u2019ve grown up, you make your own soup now. You still lean against that pillar, that blanket on the back of the chair. You didn\u2019t get here all by yourself.And then in turn, the blankets seem to say, Let me swaddle you in my warm embrace. Let me solve your temporary problems. Let me remind you that the cooking is better here than at home, the decor nicer, and the wine list long. So please, please come back.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsTrendsHot 10 2019Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
