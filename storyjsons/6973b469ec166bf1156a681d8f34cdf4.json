The pumpkin holds tremendous meaning in Vega\u2019s life as a spiritual reminder of Indigenous innovation and as a culinary staple. She uses as many varieties as she can find to produce an array of umami-rich pumpkin-based sauces. Mix in olive oil, vinegar, and honey to transform the hot sauce into vinaigrette, or simmer a cup with a can of coconut milk to start a curry-like sauce.IngredientsMakes about 3 cups12-lb. heirloom pumpkin or butternut squash6garlic cloves4oz. ginger, peeled, coarsely chopped\u00bccup apple cider vinegar\u00bccup fresh lime juice2Tbsp. fresh lemon juice2Tbsp.

I was really hoping it would taste like spicy pumpkin.  I have tried this on multiple foods and it just doesn't seem to pair well with anything to me.  JessicaPortland, OR12/22/2021So tasty and I love that I can keep the leftovers in the fridge for a couple weeks to make the most of it!AnonymousNew York3/9/2021Not for me. It's too gingery and, oddly, a bit cheesy? It also came out stringy, which I think is because I don't have a high-powered blender. I'll figure out something to do with it, but I wouldn't make it again.BrianNew York3/1/2021So. Freaking. Delicious. And gets better in the fridge overnight! Gonna keep this recipe forever.
