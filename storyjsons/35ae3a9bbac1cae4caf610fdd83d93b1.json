Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,In last week\u2019s list of things that were helping, I mentioned cry-dancing, but I forgot to talk about the other kinds of dancing that have been getting me through. Like last Friday night, when I danced for an hour on a Zoom party hosted by associate editor Hilary Cadigan and felt truly joyful for the first time in weeks.This period of quarantine has already spawned about a million posts about dancing, from the rise of virtual classes to the joys of doing it alone, and what I\u2019ve learned from reading them all is that it\u2019s hard to write well about dancing, to capture the physical experience on the flat, digital page. But luckily we have Hilary, who writes as well as she dances, and who went all out in her essay about leading Zoom dance parties for the Healthyish Guide to Being Alone.I have felt alone so many times before\u2014in crowded rooms, in bars full of people, surrounded by friends. That\u2019s what depression and anxiety can do to you, but it\u2019s also just the reality of living in this weird, connected-but-apart world, where we bond with people and then leave them, always on the hunt for something else. We move to new cities and see each other less and don\u2019t call as often as we could. Some of us get married and some of us have babies, and, slowly, without even realizing it, we break away from each other like icebergs on a warming planet.If Hilary\u2019s story inspires you to move, she\u2019ll be hosting a dance party on Healthyish\u2019s Instagram Live this Friday at 3 EST. I\u2019ll be there, as Hilary says, \u201cdancing like a maniac across the void.\u201dWhat else I\u2019m reading this week:At the height of the AIDS epidemic, an underground bakery in San Francisco was churning out thousands of pot brownies a month for sick customers. We got the full story from the baker\u2019s daughter, and, given how many of you have been clicking on our weed butter guide recently, perhaps her famous brownie recipe will be of interest too?Basically editor and Healthyish columnist Sarah Jampel pulled out the stops with this vegetarian dumpling soup that tastes like it\u2019s made with chicken broth. Bonus points for the dumplings being gluten-free.Photo by Sarah Jampel\u00a0Working from home has wreaked havoc on all of our routines, and for the most part I\u2019m fine with that. We have bigger problems than forgetting what day it is, ya know? But after reading Healthyish assistant editor Aliza Abarbanel\u2019s defense of the lunch break, I felt like it was time to establish my own midday ritual. I\u2019ve been wanting to \u201cget back into napping\u201d since I was, uh, five. Seems like now\u2019s the time.Speaking of being a toddler, here is the answer to my constant question, how many hours until it\u2019s appropriate to eat my next snack?I clicked on this story because the headline made it sound like it was about dancing, but really it was about how to live when you don\u2019t know how long you\u2019ve got (which applies to...all of us): \u201cIf I didn\u2019t drink, it was because it felt good not to drink. If I didn\u2019t eat sugar, it was in search of something better. Josie wasn\u2019t calling out in favor of cravings, addictions or the compulsive filling of voids. Josie\u2019s point was that deprivation isn\u2019t the opposite of unhealthy \u2014 it\u2019s the opposite of living.\u201dAnd this essay by Glynnis MacNicol, a love letter to the New York she once knew, caught me from the first scene: \u201cTo know New York City by bike is to know it intimately in a way not possible by foot or car. It\u2019s like being thrust into the bloodstream of a great beast, privy to its every pulse.\u201d I\u2019ve thought about this essay every day since I read it, as I\u2019ve picked up my restaurant to-go orders, walked my dog down quiet streets, and delivered groceries to neighbors. It\u2019s about the strange sadness that comes from missing your home even though you\u2019re still there and the courage it takes to love it through its darkest hours. \u201cNew York in this moment may be saying goodbye to us, but we refuse to say goodbye to New York.\u201dMe over here, missing you.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish editorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletteressayRead MoreLifestyleThree Things That Are HelpingBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
