Tart, sour, and bright, rhubarb is a harbinger of what\u2019s to come\u2014an entry point into the loads and loads of fruit desserts we\u2019ll be baking from now \u2018til fall. But as much as we love a strawberry-rhubarb situation, this fruit (or hold up: is it a vegetable?) is good for so much more than pie. Read on to find how to buy, use, and appreciate this leggy, pink\u2026fruit vegetable produce.First things first: Is rhubarb really a vegetable?It\u2019s often treated like a fruit in desserts, but rhubarb is technically a member of the buckwheat family. It was declared a fruit by the U.S. Customs Court in Buffalo, NY, in 1947 to reflect how Americans were using it.How do I know which stalks to buy?Pick thin, firm stalks\u2014these are likely to be sweeter and less stringy than thicker ones. (Redder stalks aren\u2019t always sweeter, but they make for prettier presentations.)Try this super fluffy Rhubarb Custard Cake.\nPhoto by Alex LauHow should I store them?Keep unwashed rhubarb in an unsealed plastic bag in the crisper for up to a week. If you have a large haul, wash stalks, slice, and then freeze for future pies and crumbles.Can I eat the whole thing?When prepping rhubarb, get rid of the leaves; they contain oxalic acid, which is poisonous to humans in large quantities.Put your rhubarb pickles on a salad.\nAlex LauWhat should I do with it?Try pickling! Slice 2 rhubarb stalks on a diagonal and pack into a heatproof 1-pint jar. Bring 1 cup red wine vinegar, \u00bd cup sugar, 1 \u00bd tsp. kosher salt, and \u00be cup water to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring to dissolve sugar and salt. Pour into jar; cover and chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 week. Add to salads, grain bowls, or cheese plates.Rhubarb compote would be gooood on top of yogurt\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Susie TheodorouIs there any other way to preserve it?Yes! For a rosy-hued syrup to add to cocktails or mix with club soda, bring \u00bd cup sugar and \u00bd cup water to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring to dissolve sugar. Add 1 \u00bd cups grated rhubarb, reduce heat, and simmer until fruit starts to fall apart and mixture thickens, about 5 minutes. Let cool 30 minutes. Strain into an airtight container; cover and chill up to 1 week.Or turn it into compote. Cook 1 \u00bd lb. rhubarb, chopped, 1 \u00bd cups sugar, and 2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until rhubarb is tender, 6\u20138 minutes. Transfer to a container and chill at least 2 hours and up to 3 days.Okay, but what if I want to eat it straight away?Strawberry-rhubarb pie is a classic for a reason, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t change it up. Try adding vanilla bean seeds, the zest of half an orange, or a pinch of ground cardamom.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRhubarbRead MorecookingThis Rhubarb-Almond Cake Is the Only Reason I'm Turning on My Oven This SummerBy Emma WartzmancookingA Rhubarb Custard Cake Somewhere Between Pudding and HeavenBy Emily SchultzcookingA Strawberry-Rhubarb Pie Recipe, with Special Guest Star: VodkaBy Alex BeggsRhubarb-Fennel Gin CocktailRecipes you want to make.
