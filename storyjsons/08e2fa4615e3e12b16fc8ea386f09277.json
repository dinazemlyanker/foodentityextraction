Food styling by Pearl Jones.EmailPinterestPrintEmailPinterestPrintThe Great British Bake Off winner and Netflix star Nadiya Hussein describes these crunchy ginger-almond florentines as \u201cbrandy snap meets cookie meets toffee\u201d in her book Nadiya Bakes, a cookbook companion to her Netflix series of the same name. Based on a simple batter full of almonds and crystallized ginger, these cookies bake into lacy rounds and are dipped in swirls of white and dark chocolate. For the most even spread, don\u2019t forget to press down on the cookies before baking.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt6oz. bittersweet chocolate (preferably 65%\u201375%), chopped2oz. high-quality white chocolate, choppedPreparationStep 1Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0. Heat butter, brown sugar, and corn syrup in a small saucepan over medium, stirring often with a heatproof spatula, until butter is melted and brown sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in ginger, almonds, flour, orange zest, and salt.Step 2Using a #60 or #70 cookie scoop (about 1 Tbsp.), portion out batter on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing at least 3\" apart (8 cookies per sheet). With dampened fingers, press each cookie into a 2\" disk.Step 3Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and front to back halfway through, until golden brown, 10\u201312 minutes. Using the rim of an inverted glass, nudge edges of cookies into neat circles and separate any if needed. Transfer cookies, still on parchment, to wire racks and let cool.Step 4Melt bittersweet chocolate in a small heatproof bowl set over a small saucepan of barely simmering water (do not let bowl touch water), stirring occasionally, until glossy and smooth. (Alternatively, melt in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave in 20-second increments, stirring after each, about 1 minute total.) Repeat process with white chocolate.Step 5Drizzle about one third of white chocolate over bittersweet chocolate and mix together with a skewer or chopstick to create large swirls (don\u2019t overmix or swirls will disappear). Working one at a time, dip one third of each cookie into swirled chocolate, then transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. As you work, swirl in more white chocolate as needed to maintain a distinct pattern. Let cookies sit until chocolate is set, 30\u201345 minutes.Do ahead: Cookies can be made 2 days ahead. Stack in an airtight container, separating layers with parchment paper, and chill.Recipe Excerpted From \u2018Nadiya Bakes\u2019, by Nadiya Hussain (Clarkson Potter).

So good! I followed the recipe carefully - allowed lots of room for spreading - and had no issues.  8 mins on the dot was perfect.  Like any brandy snap they take a while to set.  Huge hit in my house and perfect for Christmas.MelHSydney, Australia12/22/2021I really like these cookies. They are crispy and light, and the balance of ginger, orange zest, and almonds is great. I also used a smaller scoop (a tsp) and came away with more cookies than when I tried the tbls previously. But the real key to making these cookies is to keep an eye on them in the oven. As the recipe notes, you need to \"nudge\" the cookies away from each other to keep their shape. This is just a bit more labor-intensive than your average cookie. I used a water glass. I noticed right around the 5-minute mark is when they start to stretch, so shape them up when you switch the shelves, and then maybe one or two more times before they're done cooking. In my experience, they needed a few minutes longer than the recipe said to reach a golden brown. All that said, I'm excited to give some away as Christmas cookies to friends and family!AnonymousMA12/22/2021My cookie scoop broke so I used a tablespoon. Seemed like a lot, so dropped by tsp instead.  Even spaced so just 12 on a standard size cookie sheet, they melted into one giant mass. Tried to separate when done but it was still a mess \u2014 more like giant cookie chips than shaped cookies. Next batch made them even smaller but same result.  And they came out kind of greasy.  Needed to bake them 15 minutes to get them goldenbrown \u2014 1st batch was paler and seemed even greasier. Didn\u2019t bother w chocolate dip \u2014 would be embarrassed to put these on a cookie plate. Won\u2019t make again.
