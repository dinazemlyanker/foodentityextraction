With All the Rest, Make Bread PuddingStop staring down your staling loaf and do something about it.By Molly BazDecember 23, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Laura Murray, Food Styling by Pearl JonesFacebookTwitterEmailAt this time of year, the front display of so many grocery stores across the United States is piled high with beautifully wrapped boxes of supremely disappointing panettone.
