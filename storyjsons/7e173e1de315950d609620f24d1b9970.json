Congrats! But the real problem is that once you get your hands on that perfect specimen (and go through the trouble of breaking it down), you\u2019re going to eat a lot more of it than you intended.Which is all fine and dandy until your lips start to tingle and your tongue starts to burn and you think you\u2019ll never taste anything again. Next time, try this method from the Netflix show Ugly Delicious. In episode two (tacos!), Ren\u00e9 Redzepi of Noma fame is in Mexico preparing for his Tulum pop-up when a local man imparts a bit of cooking wisdom:  Soak the peeled pineapple in salt water to reduce some of the future irritation.His hand gesture means: Put that pineapple in some salt water.\nPhoto from Ugly DeliciousWhat\u2019s the deal? Pineapple contains bromelain, a mixture of two protein-digesting enzymes (called proteases), a corrosive chemical that breaks down amino acids (that\u2019s why pineapple is an effective and delicious meat tenderizer).When you eat pineapple, bromelain does this same protein degradation on your mouth. But don\u2019t freak out just yet: Your body begins to regenerate any damaged cells, preventing any permanent loss. Because the bromelain dissolves the protective mucous that coats your tongue and the roof of your mouth, the acidity of the pineapple is particularly irritating. It\u2019s the one-two punch of bromelain and acid that really drives the stinging sensation home.Does salt water render the bromelain ineffective? The trick seen in Ugly Delicious falls more into the category of passed-down wives\u2019 tale than scientifically-proven method, but you can find testimonies on Reddit, on cooking forums, and in other nooks and crannies of the web, too.If your tongue is still a burning fire, there\u2019s hope yet: Cooking the pineapple (grill it, roast it, or even blanch it) can remove most of the enzymes. Or pair the fruit with a creamy dairy product (yogurt, ice cream, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche). Not only will this taste very good, but it will also give the bromelain another protein to digest and help neutralize the pH.So go forth and eat as much pineapple as your little heart desires, fearlessly.Pineapple, we\u2019re not scared of you!Coconut Chia-Tapioca PuddingIf you love the texture of chia pudding, it gets even closer to bubble tea with the addition of tapioca pearls here.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titTropical FruitPineappleFruitVideoVideosRead MorerestaurantsUse Your Grill for Smoky Pineapple, Never Look BackBy Amiel StanekEverything's Right with this Upside-Down Pineapple CakeBy Rochelle BilowPhotography by Jonathan LovekinRecipes you want to make.
