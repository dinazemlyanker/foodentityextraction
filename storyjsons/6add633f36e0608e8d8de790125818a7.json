Try it with spinach, Swiss chard, or mustard greens as a quick weeknight side dish.Ingredients4 servings1large bunch purple or any other type of kale1Tbsp. grapeseed or extra-virgin olive oil2garlic cloves, finely chopped1Tbsp. perilla (sesame leaf) oil or toasted sesame oil1Tbsp. white or regular soy sauceKosher salt (optional)PreparationTrim woody ends from kale stems. Remove ribs and stems from leaves and thinly slice crosswise. Coarsely chop leaves; keep separate from stems. Heat grapeseed oil in a large skillet over medium. Cook stems, tossing occasionally, just until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Add leaves a handful at a time, tossing and letting wilt slightly before adding more; cook until all of the leaves are wilted, about 2 minutes. Add garlic, perilla oil, and soy sauce and cook, tossing often, until leaves are soft, about 3 minutes. Season with salt if needed.How would you rate Quick-Cooked Kale?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleI wasn't a big fan of this recipe. I tried Swiss chard instead of the kale and it released a lot of liquid after cooking and then again when I reheated it. Not really wow-ed by the flavours, but I may try something similar next time. Jessm91Canada3/15/2019Have already redone it with kale or green leaf lettuce...or both together, if you really want more than three servingsAnonymousBuffalo, NY3/4/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titKoreanEast AsianAsianKaleLeafy GreensVegetableMustard GreensSpinachSwiss ChardQuickEasyWeeknight MealsSideDairy-FreeVegetarianVeganHealthyishSaut\u00e9Recipes you want to make.
