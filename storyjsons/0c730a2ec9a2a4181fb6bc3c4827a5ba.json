You don\u2019t have to slow-roast or grill or pan-sear and baste a big ol\u2019 piece of meat that takes forever to cook. There\u2019s another way, a way to prep your proteins so cooking them doesn't feel like such a thing. Here's what you do: You slice it really, really thinly.Thinly slicing a boneless steak or a pork chop or a chunk of lamb leg is the easiest way to make sure weeknight dinner isn\u2019t some daunting, time-consuming event. Thinner slices mean more surface area which means a quicker cook time, and searing slim slices in a high-heat skillet or on a ripping-hot grill delivers tasty, tender meat in minutes. But if you\u2019ve ever tried to slice a raw piece of meat thinly, you\u2019ll know it isn\u2019t the easiest task.Raw meat is soft and slippery, and not exactly the easiest thing to hold, especially when you\u2019ve got a sharp chef\u2019s knife in the other hand. If a deli slicer was a luxury that we all had access to in our kitchens, this wouldn\u2019t be a problem. But that\u2019s not the case. So we\u2014the people without deli slicers\u2014use a workaround that\u2019s as low-tech as it as effective.Before slicing your meat, throw it on a rimmed baking sheet and place the whole thing in the freezer. Leave the tray uncovered, and remove it from the freezer after 15 minutes. Those 15 minutes are a good time to do any other kind of prep work that your dinner calls for. Chop some vegetables. Wash some greens. Start steaming some rice. Don\u2019t just hang around wasting time! (Also: Set a timer. You're not trying to freeze it solid!)A chilled steak is an easily sliceable steak.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesOnce the steak comes out of the freezer, it will have firmed up and be a lot more manageable. Slicing the steak thinly should be no problem at all. You\u2019ll want to get slices that are no more than \u00bc\u201d thick. The thinner the better.Once you\u2019ve sliced through all of your steak, go ahead and season it with kosher salt or whatever type of marinade you\u2019re feeling and throw it into an almost-smoking skillet with olive oil. Leave those slices undisturbed for about 3 minutes, until the outside takes on a deep brown color. Then flip them over and cook them for another minute. (You can do the same on a hot grill!)Bam. Done. Four minutes in the pan. Tender, perfectly juicy, manageable pieces of meat ready to be devoured on a Tuesday night. No deli slicer or trips to the ER required.Slice some meat.
