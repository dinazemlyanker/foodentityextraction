But I've been making this pasta for years and it's delicious. Irina12/28/2021Wow this tastes so good! After eating it I realized why it's called a carbonara. The squash replaces the eggs essentially. I read some of the other reviews and added the squash mixture slowly just so it coated the pasta. I ended up with about half of the pasta sauce left over but thats okay. Also I forgot to reserve the 1 cup of pasta water so I just used 1/4 of room temp water and that worked just as well. I also added 1/2 of red pepper flakes.GabbyChicago 12/16/2021All I have to say is wow. This was fun and so delicious to make.Madi Brownaustin,tx11/8/2021We call it squashta in our house.  There is no substitute for kabocha. This recipe is the best.Ray5448111/1/2021Excellent straight out of the book! 2nd time we used 6 oz pancetta, even better.BillLa Jolla CA3/14/2021this was indeed really tasty (of course after putting in five cloves of garlic and swapping the onion for four small shallots), but the amount of sauce was INSANE. It\u2019s like I made a full portion of pumpkin soup and i even used 500g of ravioli as opposed to 350g of pasta as indicated here and there was just so much. I would use twice less the amount of pumpkin and everything else needed for the sauce and just go with that. Otherwise really yummy even without the pancetta AnonymousNetherlands 11/21/2020Nice recipe. Added some dried chillies to pep up the flavour. One other thing: why is this described as Carbonara? Nothing remotely like carbonara.Chris HayesLondon11/21/2020I didn't use sage because I didn't have any when I cooked this, I use beef bacon instead of pancetta, but it still taste nice :) basically, the idea of squash sauce is just flawless I think. Cat's BuffetIndonesia4/14/2020Hey, Anonymous from Maryland. You probably forgot the salt, this recipe. Double the amount of Sage is gross. And why make something you're not a fan of???? Ummmm. This recipe rocked! The family loved it. Also, if you didn't know. Recipes are a guide, you didn't know you can alternate? Also, you are supposed to taste as you cook, obviously, you did not.AnonymousMontclair, NJ3/22/2020Am a butternut squash fan... but this pasta sauce was really bland even though I double the amount of fresh sliced sage.  Needs 2x or 3x more pancetta or bacon and more garlic maybe?AnonymousMaryland3/1/2020This is delicious, you really need the pancetta and sage for the texture (taste of course) This is a keeper. My husband is a celiac so I used gluten-free pasta and I actually liked it. salucesKaunakakai, HI1/27/2019YESSS!  I thought this would be a miss for my family but everyone enjoyed it.  The squash really did make it creamy.  Of course I didn't follow the recipe completely.  I used dried sage, frozen butternut squash, and oh yeah, no pancetta.  I sprinkled some bacon in my husband's dish but I enjoyed it meat free!  Delish.  A keeper for sure!Anonymous1/13/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titPastaKabocha SquashSquashVegetableButternut SquashSageHerbs & SpicesPancettaCured MeatMeatFettuccinePasta & NoodlesLinguineFallWinterMainNut-FreeSimmerDinnerRecipes you want to make.
