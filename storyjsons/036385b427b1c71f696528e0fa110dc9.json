For a chewier version, beat after adding the eggs for just 30 seconds. Vanilla and cinnamon play key roles in this snickerdoodle recipe, so opt for a warm and potent cinnamon (we like the one from Burlap & Barrel) and plump and shiny vanilla beans.If you\u2019re including these in a holiday cookie tin, keep those flavors in mind and pack them alongside brownie-like Pizzettes and a sandwich cookie like Spiced Brown Butter Linzers.

Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter, brown sugar, and 1 cup granulated sugar in a large bowl, scraping down sides, until incorporated. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; reserve pod for another use.Step 2Add eggs and continue to beat until mixture is pale yellow, begins to thicken, and falls from beaters in a ribbon-like stream, about 3 minutes. Reduce mixer speed to low. Gradually add dry ingredients and continue to beat, scraping down sides and bottom of bowl, until just combined. Let sit at room temperature at least 30 minutes to hydrate flour; dough will be very loose but will thicken as it sits.Step 3Arrange a rack in center of oven; preheat to 400\u00b0. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk cinnamon and remaining 2 Tbsp. sugar in a medium bowl.Step 4Using a 1-oz. ice cream scoop or a generous, heaping tablespoonful, portion cookies and roll into small balls with your hands. Toss in cinnamon-sugar until coated all over. Transfer to prepared sheet, spacing about 3\" apart. Do not flatten; cookies will spread as they bake.Step 5Bake cookies until edges are lightly browned and firm but centers are puffed and soft, 8\u201310 minutes. Let cool on sheets 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.Step 6Do Ahead: Cookie dough can be made 3 days ahead; cover and chill.

Once I tried this recipe, it became an all-time favorite.  It's wonderful!\nMarsha HayesCouncil Grove, Kansas2/5/2022LOVE THIS RECIPE! It\u2019s always a hit at work and such an easy thing to make the night before. Easy recipe for beginners. I love that this calls for melted cooled butter instead of softened butter so I can make these on a whim. Kate Long Beach, CA12/23/2021These were way too big, hard to work with because the dough was too soft, and spread way too muchMicheleSyracuse, NY12/19/2021Followed the recipe exactly, except reduced the bake time to 7 minutes. They were delicious and everyone who tried them raved about them. This is definitely a repeater.CLBCave Creek, AZ12/10/2021These cookies are amazing! This is my second time following this recipe I can assure you it is fool proof. I am a 15 year old baker and I bake for my school and family everyone LOVED them my first batch was sticky-ish when rolling in the cinnamon sugar but they turned out amazing I did not have any vanilla bean so I substituted for 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract. My second batch was even better because I popped them in the fridge for the last 5 minutes towards the end of the 30 minutes. I would bake these again and again and again!Amiya ArmstrongHampton, Virginia12/7/2021These cookies really are perfect! I didn't have unsalted butter so I still followed the recipe but used coarse kosher salt. I think I'll only use 1/2 tsp next time. Also I cook in a gas stove and mine runs hotter than most so I cooked at 370* for 9 minutes.  They came out perfectly!! Also when I took them out I continued to let them cook on the pan for 1 min, then moved to a cooling rack. They are buttery, crispy edges, with a really chewy center. Ahhh! Just like my childhood memories \ud83d\ude0bMelina Lehi,Utah 11/16/2021These were perfect! I wanted to throw something together quick and easy for a Monday night sweet craving. I used gluten-free all purpose flour, and a cup of butter I had melted three months ago and didn\u2019t use but still had in the fridge. I didn\u2019t weigh the ingredients and didn\u2019t let the dough sit 30 min (maybe 15 max), and eyeballed a few ingredients. I was prepared for an average cookie at best. I was SHOCKED how well they turned out! I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to recreate it since I was being so lazy, haha. Highly recommend!! Jessa9/21/2021I made these for my 10 year old grandson, who is not allowed any dairy.  I used plant butter and it worked beautifully.  He was thrilled and this grandmother loved the simplicity and clarity of the recipe  It was easy to make and the results were terrific!PamWest Carrollton, Ohio8/17/2021I successfully used baking powder instead of cream of tartar and vanilla extract instead of vanilla bean. And I had no brown sugar, so just left it out and did not replace with the same amount of granulated--the cookies were still plenty sweet. And made a half batch. They turned out delicious!MorganPittsburgh, PA8/13/2021This recipe produces delicious classic snickerdoodles. The first time I baked these I followed the recipe as written exactly. The second time, I cut the cream of tartar in half because the first batch was great but had just a touch too much aftertaste for me. I also subbed 1/4 cup of bacon fat in for some of the butter, because everything is better with bacon. These substitutions resulted in the best snickerdoodles I've ever had. AbiSeattle5/7/2021I came upon this recipe by luck, I just wanted something sweet and didn\u2019t want to go to the store. I had all of these ingredients in the pantry, so I tried them out, and I absolutely love them. I ate at least three before my family got home, and by this morning, all but two of them were gone. The only difference I made was that I used salted butter instead of adding salt (that was the only type I had on hand), and I used a little under a tbsp of vanilla extract instead of vanilla bean. Soooo good. I already have another batch in the oven. JaycieTexas3/27/2021The BEST, indeed! Glad someone flagged the MELTED butter or I may have missed it. They were easy and delicious! Crisp edges and chewy centers. A slight tang due to cream of tartar and not too sweet. Perfection. AnonymousBainbridge Island, WA3/15/2021I'd say this is a perfect cookie. Puffed and a little chewy in the middle; buttery and slightly crispy on the edges; gorgeous crackles on the top; perfect amount of tang. \nSome alterations: 1) I used 1-1 GF flour; 2) vanilla extract vs bean; 3) I was a little short on white sugar, so I subbed with about 1/4c extra brown sugar; 4) I didn't read the directions very closely, so unintentionally dumped the dry and wet ingredients in the same bowl. Once all the ingredients were added, I beat for 3ish minutes. The extended mixing time made a huge difference in how the dough came together, especially considering the GF flour; 5) Baked on the middle rack for just under 8 minutes. Note: I can't imagine cookie dough falling \"from the beaters in a ribbon-like stream\", especially a dough you form into balls to roll into sugar. That sounds like a mess. Mine looked like cookie dough with melted butter. Sometimes the GF flour makes the dough a different texture... but I mostly suspect the recipe's description is not accurate.  \n\nI'll make these again, for sure. \n\nColleenPortland, Oregon2/23/2021Love this recipe but please include weights! AnonymousAustin, TX2/13/2021I've been collecting cookie recipes for 60 years.  My list of favorites has changed many times.
