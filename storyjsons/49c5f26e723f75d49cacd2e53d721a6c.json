But black vinegar is far more than just a blade of acid. With hints of licorice and malt held together by a distinct umami earthiness that permeates the whole condiment, it\u2019s transformative, providing both acidity and complexity to round out a dish.\u201cBlack vinegar is more aromatic. White vinegar is just sour,\u201d says chef Theresa Lin, the food stylist for Ang Lee\u2019s Eat Drink Man Woman, one of the most iconic Chinese food films in history.In northern China, spoonfuls of black vinegar are draped over thick, belt-like noodles with a touch of soy sauce, served with slices of meat, onions, or wood ear mushrooms. In southern China, it\u2019s added to a slow-braise of pork ribs and sugar to create a sweet-and-sour appetizer. In Japan, it\u2019s used to coat glossy cubes of chicken in a sizzling clay pot. In Taiwan, a drop or two of Taiwanese black vinegar (pictured above) is used to flavor thick squid soup.Black vinegar, along with soy sauce, salt, sugar, and cornstarch, is the base of this tangy cabbage stir-fry.\nPhoto by Laura Murray, Food Styling by Pearl JonesSo what is black vinegar and how is it produced?The global lineup of vinegars is extensive, but the way they\u2019re made is fundamentally the same. It\u2019s a two-step fermentation process: First, alcohol is made by combining yeast with grain or fruit. The yeast converts the sugars in the grain or fruit into ethanol. Then a bacteria converts that ethanol into acetic acid, which is the main component in vinegar.Black vinegar is a broad umbrella term for a grain-based vinegar\u2014sometimes aged for years and sometimes infused with flavor. Most black vinegars are aged for at least six months and up to several years, which gives them their signature color. Traditionally, they\u2019re made in a similar process to balsamic, where the vinegar is aged in a container for years so that it develops a distinct level of complexity. The longer that it sits, the more complex the flavors become. The key differences between black vinegar and balsamic are that black vinegar is made with grains instead of grape juice and aged in clay pots instead of barrels. And whereas balsamic vinegar is made using liquid-state fermentation (only the grape juice is fermented), Chinese black vinegar is made by fermenting whole steamed grains.\u201cBlack vinegar is black due to a chemical reaction called the Maillard reaction,\u201d during which carbohydrates react with amino acids, explains Su Nan-Wei, a professor at National Taiwan University\u2019s department of agricultural chemistry. \u201cThe point is that the main ingredients are made with grain.\u201d Grain gives the vinegar a malt-like base flavor, and the Maillard reaction is responsible for bringing out umami notes.Black vinegar varies based on where, how, and by whom it\u2019s made.Chinkiang vinegar is made with sticky rice.\nAlex LauChina is the birthplace of cereal-based black vinegar, and the process eventually spread all across Asia and took on a life of its own. Generally speaking, there are four major regional types in China: the northern Chinese province of Shanxi is known for vinegar made with sorghum, wheat, and barley. The city of Zhenjiang in southern China makes its, more commonly referred to as Chinkiang vinegar, with sticky rice. Sichuan has a black vinegar made with wheat bran and seasoned with a pungent medley of Chinese medicine spices. And finally, the province of Fujian in eastern China makes a glutinous rice vinegar infused with a special fungus that gives the final product more of a dark red hue than black.Outside of China, Japan and Korea use brown rice as the base starch for their black vinegar. Taiwan\u2019s black vinegar, which starts with sticky rice, is the most divergent from the batch in that it\u2019s actually more similar to Worcestershire sauce in production. Worcestershire is made by steeping a malt vinegar base with ingredients like molasses, anchovies, garlic, and tamarind extract. Taiwanese black vinegar is similar in that much of its flavor comes from infusion. First, a basic vinegar is made with sticky rice. \u201cThen we add carrots, onions, vegetables, mushroom, tomatoes, etc. It\u2019s steeped for a minimum of one year,\u201d says Cindy Cheng, a spokesperson for Kong Yen, the largest industrial black vinegar factory in Taiwan. Wu Yin Vinegar, another major Taiwanese vinegar brand, makes its rice vinegar with Taiwanese sticky rice and malt. \u201cIt\u2019s inoculated with a starter that we\u2019ve had for over 100 years for about eight months,\u201d says Kao Chi-ting, owner of Wu Yin Vinegar, before it\u2019s infused with licorice and caramel.Taiwanese black vinegar smells simpler, fruitier, and cleaner, says Ivy Chen, a cooking teacher in Taipei. \u201cChinese vinegar, because of the aging process, is deeper and has more flavor,\u201d with a funkier aroma.Because recipes for black vinegar are wildly divergent\u2014by country, region, and company\u2014the rule of thumb is to take cues from the region where the vinegar comes from and the dishes that the area is known for. \u201cShanxi vinegar is good on noodles. Zhenjiang vinegar is good on salads,\u201d Lin advises. In Taiwan, vinegar is used sparingly\u2014a drop or two on a finished soup. And in China, it\u2019s most often used in conjunction with soy sauce. But if all that is too confusing, you can\u2019t go wrong with a universal dressing made up of equal parts soy, vinegar, and oil.\u201cAdd a tiny bit of salt, garlic, and sugar. This is a very basic sauce that can be put on salads, noodles, or even used as a dipping sauce,\u201d Lin says.Black vinegar + watermelon:Watermelon and Snap Pea SaladTake sweet, juicy melon into the realm of dinner with a hit of Taiwanese black vinegar.
