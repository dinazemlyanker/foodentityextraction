I\u2019ve been reading The Secret Life of Groceries and it is riveting. Riveting! Author Benjamin Lorr interviewed Joe himself and answers the Coke question and much more. Including how the idea for the store came to be during a nice vacation in St. Barths, why the store nixed the usual aisles of 27 different paper towels, and how Trader Joe\u2019s became the model for all other grocery stores\u2019 generic lines. I recommend reading it while crunching on some Aussie-style Chocolate Cr\u00e8me Sandwich Cookies, also known as Tim Tams.Here\u2019s what\u2019s new\u2014that I was able to get my sanitized hands on\u2014at Trader Joe\u2019s in February.Big JarsCalabrian Chili Tomato Dumpling SoupCalabrian chile (we spell it with an e at Bon App\u00e9tit) grabbed my attention while little plops of dough \u201cdumplings\u201d distracted it. More like lumps, floating in oregano-flecked creamy pasta sauce. I added TJ\u2019s Bomba sauce for double the Calabrian chile, but that\u2019s a survivalist technique. Pass on these plops.Limone Alfredo SauceBeen searching for this! I\u2019ll take the most sacrilegious heavy cream\u2013and\u2013cheese version of Alfredo over red sauce any day, especially if it\u2019s Molly Baz\u2019s pasta al limone. I was impressed with the jarred version. Tangy and lemony, super creamy, and as basic as I am. It\u2019s thick and jiggly, like a whipped body butter, so I tossed it with some pasta water to help it coat my pappardelle better. Sure, you could cook heavy cream, garlic, and lemon juice and not have to wonder what else is in that jar that makes dairy shelf-stable. But I\u2019m tired. Open the jar.Small JarsGround Fermented Black GarlicCrackly and reminiscent of decorative sand for your fish tank, though much tastier! Despite what it seems like, the garlic flavor is toasty but muted (learn more about black garlic here). I sprinkled it on popcorn, but it would be awesome in a dry rub on a roast chicken or in place of the black peppercorns on these wings.Hawaiian Macadamia Nut Blossom & Multi-Floral HoneyA lesson in marketing luxury: macadamia nut$, all the way from Hawaii, multi-floral! Most honey is multi-floral, though, because bees pollinate whatever plants turn them on (literally); it\u2019s rarer to find \u201cmono-floral\u201d honey. That\u2019s a little lesson for us all. This is a darker honey with notes of black cherry, molasses, and, uh, honey. I\u2019d save it for a cheese plate where the flavors can flourish\u2014and where you can share all of this interesting honey information with friends.FrozenSpicy Mexican-Style Riced CauliflowerIf you like cauliflower rice and are low on sodium, you\u2019re gonna love this frozen stir-fry that made my lunch break a cross between sad and spicy. Somewhere in between.Trader Joe\u2019s KibbehPretty dry, somewhat mushy, not quite what it could be when made fresh by human hands. I made a zhug-and-yogurt dipping sauce (TJ\u2019s zhug is good!), drenched the kibbeh in lemon, and finished the box. However, I hear it\u2019s illegal to buy these if you live within driving distance of Al-Ameer, so I won\u2019t be committing that crime again.Breaded Fried RavioliOhmygod! I fried these spiky pillows of gooey mozzarella in a pool of oil and had a lunch fit for a dive bar at 3 a.m. I even needed a short nap and a puke after. Just kidding! I was glowing with grease and happiness. Frozen food, packed with preservatives and salt in order to stay edible, should be exactly this terribly bad and yet good for you(r soul). The most important question you might have is what to dip them in, and this is your choice, but might I recommend TJ\u2019s Bomba sauce mixed into mayo? Rao\u2019s marinara? Ranch? Whatever you\u2019d order when you\u2019re at your lowest point will, in fact, be your highest.CansSparkling Lemon + Strawberry Apple Cider Vinegar BeverageThis reminded me of the strawberry limeade at Sonic, and the first time I realized Rollerblading could be a career. A world previously closed was now open to me. Later in high school, nearly the entire cheerleading squad was suspended because they\u2019d spiked their foam cups from Sonic (presumably, strawberry limeade, the best drink) with vodka. They were going to a basketball game where they planned on doing flips and pyramids with a little buzz on. It was a SCANDAL! That said, this sparkling apple cider vinegar beverage would be fantastic with vodka.Sparkling Ginger + Lemon Apple Cider Vinegar BeverageThis flavor isn\u2019t as sweet, but it\u2019s still very sweet. Love.Sweet, Coated ThingsAlmond Butter AlmondsMeta-snacks! Like oat milk in oatmeal, this almond butter-coated almond snack is Inception for your taste buds. Never saw the movie, honestly, but I presume it\u2019s about novelty snacks that make your life feel enriched with minor delights. These look like wet clumps of Galveston Island sand, which is brown and speckled with what I imagine to be remnants of past oil spills. The almond butter coating is slightly salty and tastes like white chocolate with a smidgen of almond butter mixed in. Low-key. It\u2019s velvety and melts in your mouth and then there\u2019s the crunch of the inner almond to keep things interesting. These disappeared.Aussie-Style Chocolate Cr\u00e8me Sandwich CookiesAn Australian acquaintance was very skeptical when I told her these were good. I wasn\u2019t able to do a side-by-side with authentic Tim Tams, but from what we know of how TJ\u2019s works thanks to The Secret Life of Groceries, I can guess they\u2019re the same. Dry and crunchy chocolate wafers enrobed in creamy, mild milk chocolate. Structurally, they\u2019re a little off-kilter; the stacked cookies sort of lean to the left. But don\u2019t we all? (Don\u2019t answer that.)Non-Dairy Chocolate Oat BeverageChocolate oat milk! Yum!Plastic-Wrapped MeatsShawarma Beef SirloinInside the body bag there is lightly seasoned meat you need to unfold before cooking. Speaking of cooking, you will overcook the meat if you follow the package instructions, and whether or not that\u2019s intended, it\u2019s all good because it\u2019s going to get smothered in spicy zhug and creamy-cool tzatziki anyway (buy separately).Sesame Teriyaki Chicken Wing SectionsMmm, sections. Eleven sweet and floppy-flabby wings (I should have baked them on a wire rack to get them crispier). What\u2019s fascinating\u2014if you find this kind of thing fascinating\u2014is that the package has instructions for air-frying, baking, and grilling. So did the breaded fried ravioli. Clearly, I need an air fryer!Salads and Salad AccessoriesVegan Taco Salad KitThis plastic bag full of more plastic bags (\u201csalad kit\u201d) has a creamy dressing, pico de goo, blue tortilla chip crumbs, and chipotle seitan doing a pretty good impression of ground beef. I ate the whole thing.Plantain CroutonsVery crunchy and dense, nice and garlicky, too hard for salad. I ate them by the handful, only to find out a serving is one tablespoon (insane).New CheesesDorothy\u2019s Holy Smoke Soft Ripened CheeseYou buy this because it\u2019s a cute flower shape. Then let it warm up to room temperature and assemble your dinner cheese plate, narrate it on TikTok, become a cheese plate sponsored-content millionaire, blow it all on an old Victorian home that needs a complete rewiring, return to the cheese plates from where it all began. Or just smother each creamy, oddly smoke-flavored bite with American Spoon\u2019s peach-habanero jelly (buy some here, it\u2019s perfect) and be happy with what you\u2019ve got.British Mustard & Ale Cheddar CheeseTHIS is the new cheese I\u2019d recommend investing your paycheck in. The little pops of mustard seeds are extremely fun to eat. The cheese is soft and mild. Would be awesome on a salami sandwich.
