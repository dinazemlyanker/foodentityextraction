(What\u2019s that, pumpkin pie? You have an answer?) When Hanukkah does come around, I dread the obligation to make them\u2014and the guilt of putting it off until zero of eight nights remain. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I appreciate a fried potato as much as the next human with a pulse, but I won\u2019t be making latkes in my kitchen this year (or any year until the end of time until I have an oven with a hood).You know what I will make? R\u00f6sti. A dish of Swiss origin made with grated potatoes and sometimes the addition of cheese, onions, herbs, and even (don\u2019t be offended) bacon, it\u2019s essentially...a giant latke, albeit with a creamier, taller interior. Just like our food editor at large Carla Lalli Music solved the age-old problem of pancakes for a crowd with this No-Flip Blueberry Oven Pancake, I look to r\u00f6sti as an easier, large-format, no-fry latke. The outside is as crisp as the outermost frills of a latke, the inside is as lush as a hot baked potato. It\u2019s a party-size hashbrown!So you get that r\u00f6sti are larger than latkes, but what makes them better? First, most latkes are just plain bad. There are so many ways to go wrong, and they never turn out as you\u2019ve envisioned. Maybe they\u2019ll fall apart. Maybe they\u2019ll be mushy. Maybe they\u2019ll be bland or crazy salty. Maybe they\u2019ll all sog. Or maybe the first ones will sog and the rest will burn. Maybe they\u2019ll be all crispy edges with no tender middles. Maybe sour cream and applesauce will be their only salvation. Yes, worse things have happened, but I\u2019d rather have r\u00f6sti, which never needs a cover-up.And even when latkes do go well (a real Hanukkah miracle), your kitchen is done for. You might as well start looking for a new place now. There will be splatters of oil everywhere, in places you\u2019ll never be able to clean. Your pans will need to be scrubbed inside and out (some will never recover). Any item of clothing that you were wearing will have to be washed immediately. If you\u2019re me, you\u2019ll consider having your apartment fumigated.Then there\u2019s the problem of making latkes for a crowd. Crisp latkes, like all fried foods and all human beings, are dying slowly\u2014every tick of the clock is one second closer to demise. Sure, you can keep them warm in a low-temperature oven, but nothing beats the texture straight from the skillet. Are you going to knowingly feed your guests sub-par latkes? Or are you going to stand at the stove like a short-order line cook? (Boy do I sound like my mother.)For contributor Claire Saffitz\u2019s salt-and-vinegar r\u00f6sti, there\u2019s hardly any stove supervision required. Par-boiled potatoes are grated, mixed with vinegar-soaked onions, and baked for 45-60 minutes, after which the cakes are broiled on both sides\u2014crispiness insurance! Think about everything you could do while the r\u00f6sti bakes. You could cook something to complete your meal, so that you\u2019re not only eating potatoes for dinner. You could play a rousing game of dreidel or eat your weight in gelt. You could fall asleep (set a timer though) or fall down an internet rabbithole.I\u2019d make r\u00f6sti on Hanukkah and on any of the other 357 days of the year because there\u2019s no fry oil to filter and there\u2019s no grease-covered cooling racks to attempt to clean. Can latkes do that?Get the recipe:Salt-and-Vinegar R\u00f6stiView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHanukkahHoliday 2019Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
