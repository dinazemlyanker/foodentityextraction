Gruy\u00e8re is classic for that French onion soup flavor, but any fairly firm cheese like cheddar or Gouda will work\u2014you can even mix and match if you\u2019d like.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

And it came out AMAZING! We highly recommend this dip!!  AshleyNew York City1/9/2022Followed the recipe to the letter. I've been a professional chef for several years now. This for me was a hard pass. The savoury onions mixed with the cream cheese, sour cream and mayo was way too rich. As it suggested in the recipe I tired serving it with pears and apples and that was still not enough to cut through the richness. \n\nThis as a spread on a sandwich or served with charcuterie might be amazing. East coast cooksnewfoundland 12/27/2021I made this per the recipe- it is absolutely delicious!  It is definitely a crowd pleaser, and I will be looking for excuses to make it again.Susan C.Northern VA12/25/2021Made this for our Christmas Eve lunch at work, and it is fantastic.  Followed the recipe as it is written, and I have noooooo regrets.  Seriously yummy. Kris KimbleMelbourne Beach12/24/2021Out of this world! Fantastic dip for the holidays. The suggested endive, pear, and baguette was a great accompaniment to this dish. I used a mandolin to slice the onions. This certainly cut down on tedious chopping. I wouldn\u2019t change a thing! Elizabeth PerrineCharleston, SC 12/23/2021My daughter wanted French Onion soup but when I came across this recipe from my new issue had to make it instead.  Well move over soup this dip is to delicious.  Creamy and onions aren't overpowering when cooking them to their jammy, sweet consistency! I used swiss cheese and some cheddar instead of Gruyere which can be costly for this type of dish.  Also used one less onion....make again next week!Karol GraceHammonton, NJ12/13/2021Turned our fantastic. Made 3 days ahead per the instructions. Big party hit.

That'a waste. MFBEarth12/5/2021This is delicious. I served it with baguette and low salt Old Dutch ripple chips. I added about 2 tbsp red wine to deglaze once done carmelizing the onions. I used 6 small to med yellow onions, about 4.5 cups sliced. I used a smaller cast iron pan and it took me an hour for the onions. I would note that if you use a 2qt dish with less surface area than the cast iron skillet the topping will be quite substantial. I used a deeper casserole dish and the topping was thicker than desired.LauraWinnipeg, MB12/5/2021This is unbelievably delicious.  Served with a baguette, sliced apples, pears and crackers.  Didn't try the endive spears but will, next time.  One prep note -- recipe says to thinly slice, which resulted in stringy onions that were hard to scoop neatly onto the bread or fruit slices.  Next time, I would chop the onions to make it easier to eat.  Worth every calorie.Creek ChefKittery, ME12/4/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titSnackStarterVegetarianNut-FreeDipGruy\u00e8reCheeseCheddarGoudaCream CheeseRecipes you want to make.
