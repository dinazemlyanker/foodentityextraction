Not a repeat for sure.NerkoWestport, CT10/7/2021We don't eat potatoes, so we substituted chopped cauliflower florets and the recipe was excellent. It has a subtle taste that works great with cod.  We also used vidalia (sweet) onions and for appearance, topped with black sesame seeds along with the scallion slices.  Appearance was good enough to serve company.  David OBoston, MA7/8/2021One of the best white fish dishes we've ever tasted, and will definitely make again. Potato slices became crispy on the underside and provide a layer between the heat and the fish, so the fish basically was steamed to tendernessAnonymousNew York6/14/2021will not make again, do not use a thick fish filet, took too long to cook thru and ended up over cooked and tough.Anonymousnorthern California12/22/2020I'm not a pro.  This is good. Make it. Substitute if you need.. Make it.  This is good.Chacha55Clarksville,  Arkansas 9/27/2020This dish was tasty! Next time, I will look into how to cook the potatoes all the way through without destroying my pan... :( Next day leftovers are even better than the original dish. Make sure you leave yourself a little extra for the following day!AnonymousSeattle, WA7/23/2020Simple and simply delicious. Excellent weeknight meal (though the onions do take time), this was a big hit with the kids and adults in my house. AnonymousMontclair, NJ 6/24/2020This is the best bon appetit recipe I've ever made! It was so easy but gratifying as a young burgeoning home cook.sjeyaDallas, TX6/22/2020I've recently made several recipes from Bon Appetit and loved every single one but this one did not come together for me.  It was very one-note as expected with just soy sauce and salt as the seasoning.  It was also time-consuming having to cook onions and potatoes separately.  My family didn't care of it at all.  Felt like I wasted good, fresh-caught halibut.  AnonymousTruckee, CA6/21/2020Excellent. beloved by all who ate it.a.goekler7491Denton, TX6/19/2020This was outstanding.  Plan on spending a good 40 minutes in front of the stove, but worth it for a really nice dinner for two. I didn't have the fancy toppings, but did top with scallions, red pepper flakes and toasted sesame seeds. I added some finely chopped kale from my garden to the onion mixture after the onions had finished caramelizing. The recipe doesn't needed it, I just needed more healthy greenage in my dinner and didn't want to have to make a separate side. Can't wait to make this again!AnonymousMaine6/16/2020This was great easy weeknight dinner! I grated the ginger instead of cutting it into matchsticks - that was a mistake.\nAnonymousFrance6/10/2020This was v simple and easy to make. I had to make enough to serve 4 so the potatoes took a little long, since they had to be cooked in a single layer without piling up, but it all come together nicely. Served this with a side of rice and some greens. Queens6/9/2020So good, so easy (not fast, but easy), so few ingredients. Use high quality soy sauce. The onions and potatoes pack a wallop. Super easy week night meal if you don't mind the time it takes to caramelize the onions.6/9/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titCodFishSeafoodOnionVegetableEasyQuickOne-Pot MealsWeeknight MealsMainNut-FreeDairy-FreeHealthyishSaut\u00e9DinnerRecipes you want to make.
