Next up is Quinta Brunson, comedian, actress, viral video star, and author of the new memoir She Memes Well.For the past seven years, Quinta Brunson\u2019s largely been recognized as the delightfully awestruck Girl Who\u2019s Never Been on a Nice Date, her first foray into online comedy back in 2014. Clips of her have since been shared millions of times, whether it\u2019s her deadpan rendition of the Space Jam theme song, or the spat between her and her disgruntled eyebrows from the Facebook Watch series Quinta vs. Everything. But just as the social media landscape has evolved over the past decade, so, too, has Brunson.Offline, the 31-year-old West Philadelphia native has spring-boarded to television, doing voice work for animated series like Big Mouth and Lazor Wulf. In 2019, she made her HBO debut as a cast member of the Emmy-nominated A Black Lady Sketch Show; her new workplace sitcom, Abbott Elementary, is set to air on ABC later this year; and her latest project, a memoir titled She Memes Well, reveals a series of relatable missteps and milestones designed to show her fellow \u201ckids of the internet\u201d what it looks like to keep going and growing, IRL.She Memes Well: Essays$25 $12 at Amazon$25 $23 at BookshopBrunson\u2019s also dedicated to making strides in the kitchen. In one of the book\u2019s essays, \u201cOn Cooking,\u201d she owns up to her lacking culinary skills. \u201cI hold cooking on this pedestal that unlocks the necessary elements for me to be a grown woman,\u201d she writes. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can be as strong a performer or worker if my home life isn\u2019t strong.\u201d Since moving in with her fianc\u00e9 in Los Angeles, she\u2019s committed herself to cooking dinner at least once a week, despite the fact that, as she wrote, working in the kitchen scares her \u201cmore than public speaking, nuclear war, and leaving [her] phone in an Uber combined.\u201dOn a phone call, I learn Brunson\u2019s every bit as straightforward and down-to-earth as she seems online. In the run up to the book\u2019s June 15 release, we chat about her quest for meal-making mastery, her biggest hometown hankerings, and the importance of establishing boundaries in comedy.Somebody once told me\u2026 there\u2019s a difference between a comic, a comedian, and a clown, and you have to choose which one you want to be in your career. With a clown, it\u2019s like: \u201cBe silly for me!\u201d Being a comic is about controlling the narrative coming out of your life. And being a comedian is about seeing the funny in everything. I\u2019ve said to myself: \u201cI\u2019ll live between comic and comedian, but I\u2019ll never be a clown.\u201dI am a human being\u2026 and not my work. I made a decision early on that my life would not be my product. I\u2019ve set a boundary for myself: I\u2019ll give people the work, which was made with the intent to make them happy and laugh. I have no opinion on people who are their work, because that serves a purpose in and of itself. But I knew for me, that approach was not going to work.For all the bad on the internet\u2026 I think there are people on there doing amazing things. Look at Will Smith and Leslie Jordan\u2014these actors who have found new ways to connect with new audiences on social media. I\u2019m, like, 47 in Internet years, so my focus is not set on the new, emerging platforms. I simply couldn\u2019t grasp TikTok as a creator. It wasn\u2019t clicking for me. But I can\u2019t ever say that I\u2019m fully taking it off the table. I think the internet is ever-evolving.It took me about three years to write my book\u2026 and \u201cauthor\u201d me is irritable! It took so long because of how much I would procrastinate. My other work flows out pretty easily, but the book was a bit more difficult. Figuring out what I wanted to put out there about myself forever was daunting at times.I want to get more creative with cooking\u2026 in the same way that I am with other areas of creativity in my life. I have a limited toolkit of recipes that I know will work. I\u2019ve got baked chicken wings down; adobo, pepper, and garlic salt. I got the recipe from my mom and when I made it for her, she was proud of me. My dad makes collard greens very well and I\u2019ve started experimenting with them, too. Just like: \u201cWhat would lemon taste like on this? What if I add a little bit of garlic?\u201d But I want to get so free that I can just throw things together and look like I\u2019m in \u201cRatatouille,\u201d just throwing down!When it\u2019s cook\u2019s night off\u2026 I used to Postmates the Mexican Pizza from Taco Bell, until they got rid of it. I have no idea why they did that! It wasn\u2019t hurting anyone! I\u2019ve @\u2019ed them on social media twice now, to no avail. My goal now is to get so famous that I have some type of pull over Taco Bell.The Philly food I miss most is\u2026 Herr\u2019s Sour Cream & Onion potato chips. I either get those delivered to me from Amazon, or friends will send them to me. Recently, though, CVS stores in L.A. have started carrying them, but for some reason they taste different here. A dirty corner store in Philly, that\u2019s where you get the best tasting bags. It\u2019s safe to say I also miss cheesesteaks and pretzels. Philly does a soft pretzel exceptionally well. It\u2019s part of the culture there. Another thing that I miss more than anything is hoagies. The closest I can get here is Jersey Mike\u2019s. But sandwiches made on an Amoroso\u2019s roll\u2014which are made in Philly\u2014just taste different. And there\u2019s something about the corner stores and the person who makes the hoagie\u2014it all matters.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishPerson of InterestInterviewsRecipes you want to make.
