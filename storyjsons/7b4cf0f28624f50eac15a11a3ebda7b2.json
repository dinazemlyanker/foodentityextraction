Jorge will make sure of that.Here at Casa Jacaranda, the dreamy sun-dappled home Jorge shares with his husband Beto Est\u00faa in the middle of Mexico City\u2019s cooler-than-cool Roma neighborhood, the couple hosts cooking classes several times a week. But they\u2019re not the kind of cooking classes that make you feel like a sheepish tourist, limping through a rapid-fire series of dumbed-down recipes with a bunch of other sheepish tourists. Spending the afternoon with Jorge and Beto feels more like reconnecting with old friends\u2014if those old friends lived in a house straight out of the pages of Architectural Digest and knew how to whip up a 20-ingredient mole from scratch. Plus, there\u2019s wine.The day begins at 10 a.m. with a purposeful wander through the nearby Medell\u00edn Market, a riot of serpentine pathways woven around stalls stacked with brightly colored sauces and fruits. Medell\u00edn sells produce and products from all over Mexico, and is particularly significant for the city\u2019s diverse immigrant communities, many of whom hail from South America.\u201cComing to a market in Mexico is all about the relationships you have with the sellers,\u201d Jorge says. He picks out ingredients for the afternoon\u2019s lunch lesson, dipping from a seemingly infinite reservoir of knowledge about everything we see, from the dried chiles to the coffee beans.A day at Casa Jacaranda begins with a trip to the Medell\u00edn Market with Jorge.\nPhoto by Cody James\u201cHere, try this,\u201d he says, handing me what appears to be a mango, but shrunken down to the size of a ping-pong ball. It\u2019s the sweetest mango I\u2019ve ever tasted, its texture like velvet. A few stands over, we meet Don Carlos Palma, who has been here selling products from Mexico\u2019s Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula since 1968. His offerings are eclectic: bottled horchata; ground pepitas for making nutty, tomatoey sikil p'aak dip; canned cheese from Holland that\u2019s somehow become a Yucat\u00e1n staple; and an array of handmade hot sauces. The coconut varietal is my favorite, sweet and creamy and fiery all at once. I buy a few bottles to take home. \u201cIt\u2019s important to know that there\u2019s no such thing as one Mexican cuisine,\u201d Jorge tells us. \u201cRather, it\u2019s a bunch of different regional cuisines, all with their own unique flavors and styles.\"Jorge grew up in Cuernavaca, capital of Mexico\u2019s Morelos state, where his family owned a restaurant. He became a graphic designer because he didn\u2019t want to spend his life working in the family business. \u201cThose long hours, those nonexistent Christmases, no thank you!\u201d he says with a wave of his hand. \u201cBut the love was there.\u201dDon Carlos Palma has been selling products from the Yucat\u00e1n at the Medell\u00edn Market since 1968.\nPhoto by Cody JamesIn Morelos, where the cuisine is influenced by a rich agricultural tradition and a confluence of cultures indigenous to the region, Jorge would ride through the mountains on his family\u2019s horses. \u201cWhen it was time for lunch we would just go to the closest house, ask for food, and these ladies\u2014who sometimes had next to nothing\u2014would whip up something beautiful out of two eggs, tortillas, and chile, and that\u2019s it,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI didn\u2019t think much of it back then, but I know now that I was blessed to see that. That\u2019s traditional Mexican cooking. Nothing fancy; just using the fire, smoking things, grinding everything by stone.\u201d It\u2019s these kinds of simple, old-school methods he hopes to share in his classes: the tried-and-true backbones of Mexican cooking.Back at the house after our market trip, we set down our things and gather around a large central island off the kitchen, in an open room flush with sunlight. Artwork covers the walls and sits stacked in corners. Books overflow from the shelves. A potted tree grows through its own personal skylight. Beto stands at the head of the island in front of a large cooktop, setting out bowls of spices and dried chiles. Jorge points to a large chalkboard wall, where he\u2019s written out a flow chart for the recipe we\u2019ll be making today: Oaxacan mole, one of the most complicated dishes in Mexican cuisine. The chart is broken out by method\u2014grill, fry, boil, burn, grind\u2014and all leads up to the crucial step, which is circled many times over with different colored chalk: INCORPORATE!Jorge and Beto's home is decorated with art from their travels.\nPhoto by Cody James\u201cMole is considered by many the first true fusion dish,\u201d Jorge says. \u201cIt\u2019s also the first truly Mexican dish, because it combines the spices that are native to Mexico, the spices that Europe gave us, and many of the ingredients that the Spanish brought from Asia. And that, really, is Mexico.\u201d He pauses for effect. \u201cIt is not what was before the Spaniards came, and not what they brought with them; rather, it\u2019s what happened when those things collided.\u201dSince the beginning, Beto and Jorge\u2019s relationship has been built on a shared love of food and cooking. The idea to start a class came from the constant requests Beto and Jorge would field from American friends. \u201cOne of them would call me and say, \u2018You don\u2019t know this but we are having dinner at your place Saturday, and my friends want to learn to make your enchiladas,\u201d Jorge recalls. \u201cEventually it got to a point where we said, oh we could charge for this, no?\u201dJorge and Beto teach classes about three times a week at their home in Mexico City's Roma neighborhood.\nPhoto by Cody JamesThe pair seems uniquely suited to the task. Beto is patient as he teaches us how to make tortillas from nixtamalized masa dough, the kernels soaked in limestone to unlock their niacin. We light a few of the tortilla on fire to bring out the smoky flavor, which will go into the mole along with the chiles, tomatoes, onions, garlic, apples, raisins, plantains, almonds, sesames, spices, and ground cacao to form a thick onyx-colored paste.\u201cRecipes should be shared so they don\u2019t go extinct,\u201d says Jorge, demonstrating the proper way to crush spices with a mortar and pestle (twist, don\u2019t hack). The tamales come next. After a few tries I manage to master the rolling technique. Packed tight, the steamer is turned on to do its work.Beto makes tortillas out of masa dough.\nPhoto by Cody James\u201cFor many decades, Mexican food was untouched. No one played with it, no one changed a single thing about the techniques or ingredients, because what we Mexicans like are the flavors of when we were growing up\u2014what our abuelas made. We like the nostalgia.\u201d That\u2019s changing now, he says, but maintaining respect and understanding for the past is crucial.A day at Casa Jacaranda concludes with a meal on the couple's rooftop, beneath the jacaranda tree.\nPhoto by Cody JamesWhen the meal is ready, there\u2019s one more surprise. \u201cFollow me!\u201d says Beto, and we gather the dishes and carry everything up a flight of floating stairs. The door opens and suddenly we\u2019re on a beautiful rooftop patio, awash with greenery and shaded by the gnarled branches of a jacaranda tree heavy with purple blossoms. Jorge pulls out a few bottles of local Mexican wine and passes them down the table. We unwrap our tamales to reveal their downy, sweet flesh and dollop our homemade tortillas with the spicy, smoky mole we made ourselves. For dessert, there\u2019s ice cream made from mamey, a sweet salmon-colored fruit that only grows south of Texas.At the end of the meal we say our goodbyes, gather our things, and mosey on. Outside the cool, quiet cocoon of Casa Jacaranda, the streets are hot and crowded, but I feel calm, happy, sated.
