Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,It\u2019s been a major week for beans. First, the humble ingredient got a starring role in our brand-new Healthyish recipe, Pantry Pasta With Vegan Cream Sauce, which social media director Rachel Karten tells me is already our most-liked Instagram post of all time. On top of that, Basically editor, Healthyish columnist, and loveable overachiever Sarah Jampel not only developed that bean-forward pasta recipe but also gave us nine more very smart ways to turn a can of beans into dinner. SJ, you had me at \u201c#3, bean confit.\u201dToday, Sarah and I also talk about beans and more (well, actually just beans) on the Bon App\u00e9tit Foodcast, and it might be the most effusive conversation that two introverted people have ever had while being recorded.I\u2019ve felt excited about beans ever since I started cooking from Amy Chaplin\u2019s Whole Food Cooking Every Day. She uses beans in unexpectedly delicious ways\u2014pat\u00e9s, sauces\u2014and I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that beans just might be the perfect food: They\u2019re 1) economical, 2) good for you, 3) fast (if you\u2019re buying canned, which I definitely am), 4) shelf-stable, 5) climate friendly...I could go on, but I can see your eyes glazing over.Okay, but there\u2019s actually one more thing to say about beans. Last week I had the kasujiru at Rule of Thirds in Brooklyn. It\u2019s a clay pot filled with silky, sake-infused soup that\u2019s often made with salmon, but this version uses\u2014that\u2019s right\u2014beans! Butter beans, to be exact. It\u2019s impossibly creamy and, just as impossibly, vegan. And that\u2019s the power of beans.What I\u2019m consuming besides beans:This podcast episode of Unladylike with Esm\u00e9 Weijun Wang, author of The Collected Schizophrenias, about being both \u201chigh functioning\u201d according to society and also mentally ill. \u201cI know that because I dress well and I can speak eloquently, that I am treated more well than people with the same diagnosis who...can't say they went to a fancy school,\u201d she says. \u201cSo much of the idea of being high functioning is linked to money and whether one can make money or be part of that world.\u201dThe marinated greens at Leo in Brooklyn. Lizzie Noonan wrote about this dish recently on Healthyish, and, after ordering three (yes, three) bowls of them at dinner the other night, I\u2019m convinced that they\u2019re what all cooked greens aspire to be.Meredith Talusan\u2019s debut memoir, Fairest, which is not out for another two months but which I am too excited about not to mention. I tore through an advance copy last weekend and have been thinking about it since.Priya Krishna\u2019s new Kadhi recipe, which I haven\u2019t consumed yet but plan to make ASAP because...well, just look at that photo and tell me you don\u2019t want a creamy, tangy, turmeric-y soup with rice right now.Tangerine Jones\u2019s essay on the whole Rage Baking dust-up, which has been covered at length in various publications. To support Jones and the physical and emotional labor she contributed to the Rage Baking movement, she asks that you donate to the following organizations: Ali Forney Center,  Brooklyn Community Bail Fund, and The Campaign against Hunger.The fattest, softest, sweetest dates I\u2019ve ever encountered from Rancho Meladuco. You could make a very luxurious date caramel with them...but they\u2019re so good I prefer to eat them straight.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish EditorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletterWhite BeanessayRead MoreLifestyleNo More Free (Kale) MassagesBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
