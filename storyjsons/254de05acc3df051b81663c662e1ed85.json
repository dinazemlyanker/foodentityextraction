I will show up.Hey dude, want to help me move next Saturday? My new spot is a six floor walk-up without A.C. There will be linguine alle vongole. Yes. Sounds great! I\u2019ll be there.Hey dude, I need to give my dog it\u2019s new medication, and it\u2019s really a two person job. Will you come assist me in the procedure? I\u2019m making some steamed mussels in a garlicky tomato sauce. Of course! It would be my pleasure to hold down your hundred pound Doberman while you attempt to get it to swallow pills.Hey dude, I have to drive my Great Aunt Bertha to my Mom\u2019s house in Ohio. The speakers in my car don\u2019t work, but it\u2019s a quick six hour drive. And she doesn\u2019t really yell that much. I made some shrimp scampi for the road. Packed it all up in Tupperware. And Great Aunt Bertha is bringing some crispy bread for dipping. Will you come to keep me company? Wow. Really? When do we leave? I am DOWN.Because shrimp scampi is the real ticket, the greatest excuse to bask in the comforts of shrimp, garlic, wine, and butter. It is the simplest of meals, with the most indulgent payoff, and we have a pretty damn good recipe for it. There\u2019s nothing in this scampi recipe that will be unfamiliar to you. All of these ingredients are very run-of-the-mill stuff that you probably have in your fridge or pantry already.It starts with taking your shrimp and marinating them briefly in a mix of kosher salt, grated garlic, and oil. Microplaning the garlic is the secret for getting a deep flavor into those crescent-shaped crustaceans and turning up the sauce from one to eleven.The scampi comes together quickly after that. You cook the shrimp halfway and then remove them from the pan. At that point, you cook a bunch of sliced garlic in the remaining oil, lemon juice, and a bit of wine, before adding the shrimp back into the pan and bringing the whole thing home.If you really want to do it up, serve this with garlic bread. But that's only for the true garlic daredevils.\nHirsheimer & HamiltonThis scampi starts and ends with really working garlic and fat into your shrimp, and it\u2019s a worthwhile effort. By the end, each bite of tender shrimp is completely suffused with layer after layer of flavor. Acid from the lemon. Heat from chile flakes. Creaminess from the butter. A little bit of fruitiness from the wine. And equal parts bite and sweetness from the garlic. It\u2019s a roster of simple flavors that turn into a beautiful symphony.But this is really just proof that scampi doesn\u2019t have to be dumped on top of pasta. Sure, many of the Italian-American restaurants of our time have done just that, but in my eyes, shrimp scampi does its best work when served on a big platter surrounded by warm crusty bread. Dip your bread into that sauce, and pile a few tender, flavorful shrimp on top. Eat. Again. And again. And again. Is this a single serving? Or an experience for the whole family? That\u2019s up to you. Either way, doubling this recipe won\u2019t hurt.But I can\u2019t stick around while you decide. I have to run. Great Aunt Bertha is outside in the car. And...yes, it looks like she brought the bread.Oh! And here's the shrimp scampi recipe in question. It will not fail you:Shrimp ScampiThis shrimp scampi recipe gets an extra punch of garlicky flavor from a short marinade before cooking.
