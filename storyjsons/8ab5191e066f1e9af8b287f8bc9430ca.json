Having Sheldon Simeon, the chef and owner of Tin Roof, as your guide. Here, he goes all in on Maui, specifically the northwest side of the island, sharing his ideal itinerary for taking in the island: eating poke, hitting the beach, sipping mai tais, and more.\u00a0Check out more food-focused itineraries from our favorite food people here.The good stuff at Oki\u2019s Seafood CornerPhoto by Mark KushimiShave ice is always in season at Ululani\u2019s Hawaiian Shave Ice.Photo by Mark KushimiMauiI love starting my day with the whole family at Upcountry Farmers Market, smack in the middle of the island. All the cool stuff is out in the morning, like rambutan and flowering chives, plus I enjoy talking story with the farmers.We\u2019d drive north to Makawao Town, known for paniolo\u2014Hawaiian cowboys who live and work there\u2014and walk around the main streets. Then let\u2019s head west.Grab some poke from Oki\u2019s Seafood Corner, which has fish you don\u2019t normally see, like aku (skipjack tuna) and ono (wahoo). With our cooler full of poke, we\u2019ll hit up Launiupoko Beach, which has kiddie pools, waves for my older kids to surf, and grills.You\u2019ll notice we haven\u2019t eaten much, and that\u2019s because we\u2019re saving up for Papa\u2019aina, chef Lee Anne Wong\u2019s freaking awesome brunch spot a couple miles north. She\u2019s got noodles and cocktails like the bourbon-forward Miso Mashed, but my favorite thing is the French toast: Hawaiian sweet bread soaked in coconut milk, coated in cornflakes, and deep-fried.You might need to take a nap\u2014or you could go to Ululani\u2019s Hawaiian Shave Ice since there is always room for shave ice in my book. Locally run, locally owned, it\u2019s known for its super soft snow. I\u2019m a purist when it comes to syrups: the higher the fructose, the better. I love banana and bubble gum, but my kids always get mango with li hing mui powder on top.We\u2019ll wander over to Kaanapali Beach to watch the sunset, then sneak over to Monkeypod Kitchen for one of their killer mai tais (the honey lilikoi foam on top is so good).To finish the night, we\u2019ll sink into Sale Pepe, the most perfect Italian restaurant. The pastas are freshly made every day and the pizzas are baked in a stone oven. Shoot, that\u2019s my perfect day.WHERE TO STAY:The Plantation Inn, an 18-room B&B that\u2019s a hidden gemWHAT TO BRING BACK:\u00a0Jewelry made of Hawaiian wood from Native IntelligenceExplore Bon App\u00e9titMauiRestaurantsTravelRecipes you want to make.
