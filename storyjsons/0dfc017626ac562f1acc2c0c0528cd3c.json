Looking back, I think that\u2019s what I appreciate most about them.By  Jennifer Hope ChoiAugust 19, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Hye Jin ChungFacebookTwitterEmailIn August 1995 my family embarked on a seven-state road trip, seeking the humble splendors of quintessential cross-country tourism: dripstone show caves, gold mines, Old Faithful\u2019s clockwork blast, and the four avoidant gazes chiseled into Mount Rushmore\u2019s colossal facade.When we set out on our adventure, I expected some cross between the Oregon Trail computer game and National Lampoon\u2019s Vacation\u2014no dysentery, but long days spent exploring the great outdoors, racking up mileage as cornfields blurred past the car windows; a montage of sibling squabbles, sing-alongs, and pit stops for cheeseburgers with mud-thick chocolate milkshakes at diners untouched by time.We weren\u2019t pioneers, though. Or the Griswolds. We were just six Koreans cooped up in a minivan bound north and east from our home in California. My mother, Umma, kept a map tucked into the knockoff Louis Vuitton fanny pack ever hitched to her hip, guiding us on a route designed by a local Triple A agent. My grandparents (who had survived Japanese imperialism and the Korean War), my sister, cousin, and I came along for the ride.We didn\u2019t know any of the same songs, so there would be no sing-alongs. No diners or cheeseburgers either. Instead, we\u2019d packed enough food to survive for a month on the road without ever stopping. Grandma brought a 38-quart Igloo wheelie cooler filled with kimchi, whole danhobak (kabocha squash), and 30 rolls of gimbap\u2014laver seaweed (gim) wrapped around a rainbow of vegetables and rice (bap).To say I was disappointed by our fixed menu would be an understatement. I wanted the American food that matched an American vacation. If left to my own devices, I could\u2019ve mainlined ranch dressing all the way to South Dakota and back. As a nine-year-old, I didn\u2019t understand yet the sacredness of our homemade food.My mother was the kind of woman who washed and reused ziplock baggies, so I assumed we\u2019d lugged our own provisions due to her notorious frugality. Umma, the ricewinner of the family, worked day and night shifts as a registered nurse, saving up over the school year to take us on summer vacations. I don\u2019t know how she lasted the Disney Big Red Boat cruise or the all-inclusive weekend at Baja California\u2019s Rosarito Beach without Korean sustenance.Perhaps this is why she never seemed happy, even in photos, her mouth eternally crimped into a frown. Almost every meal concluded with her declaring, \u201cYou know, I just don\u2019t feel full without kimchi and rice.\u201dThe trips were meant to expand our horizons, \u201cfor the cultures,\u201d she\u2019d say tersely\u2014which appeared to come at the cost of her own satisfaction. When we hit the road that August, though, my grandma, Halmoni, made sure to pack a rice cooker and a gallon tub of kimchi.Oh, the kimchi. That \u201codor-resistant\u201d cooler didn\u2019t stand a chance. Like prying open a crypt, even the narrowest crack of the lid released a sharp, mellifluous tang, potent enough to make your eyes water. When we popped it open at rest stops, I could practically see the stink lines wafting into the air, floating over to neighboring tables.We were picnicking in Yellowstone National Park, preparing the usual\u2014my sister divvying off-brand cola into Styrofoam cups, Halmoni passing out the disposable chopsticks\u2014when a blonde pig-tailed girl walked by us. She\u2019d spotted the kimchi sopped in blood-red chili juice; after catching a whiff, her face twisted with mystified disgust.As if to ally myself with this stranger, I whined loudly: \u201cCan\u2019t we have hot dogs?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s hot dogoo in the gimbap,\u201d Umma mumbled, mouth stuffed.But I wanted mine in a bun.Illustration by Hye Jin ChungEven though I actually adored gimbap, I\u2019d recently discovered that my peers did not. Just the sight of it disturbed them, which meant that liking it made me strange, and different.A few months prior I\u2019d brought gimbap to school on International Day. I showed up to class wearing my petal-pink hanbok, positively giddy, like I was performing a more Korean version of myself in a play. I set our platter on a table in the center of the room alongside 30 other family-made dishes.Halmoni had woken up early that morning to prepare the gimbap for me. Still a Buddhist then, she handled every ingredient with quiet reverence, slivering carrots thinner than matchsticks, culling the spinach fronds from scalding water, dappling fresh bap with sesame oil, slicing egg pancakes and yellow danmuji (pickled radish) into uniform belts. The pi\u00e8ces de r\u00e9sistance? Hot dog strips, gone curly from a light pan-sear. She arranged the items atop a sheet of rice-covered gim, and before the stack could topple, her elegant hands squeezed the roll taut with a bamboo mat. She cut the rolls into rings so the black gim encircled tiny colorful vivisections, each an edible Mondrian.At school, one after another, we shimmied down the buffet line. My classmates sluiced gobs of ambrosia, mac and cheese, and tuna casserole onto their plates. But the gimbap sat undisturbed beside an equally unpopular knoll of beige sauerkraut. I didn\u2019t even get a pity sample from our teacher.I wondered if it was merely an issue of unflattering lighting until I caught a few kids grimacing at the rolls. And that\u2019s when I saw gimbap as they must have\u2014Frankenfood: the hot dog\u2019s unnatural pink, the radish\u2019s highlighter yellow, the seaweed\u2019s coal black. It surprised me how quickly this tenderly made thing had warped into an object of repugnance, the way shame steals what we privately love in the face of public spectacle.There\u2019s a Korean word, ahkkawuh, which, according to my mother, roughly translates to \u201cguilt for wasting something precious.\u201d With food, this typically leads to a force-feeding situation. But there was no way I could finish the platter on my own. Not without causing a scene. So I took a seat, my dress\u2019s starched fabric suddenly unbearable on my skin. The gimbap seemed to pulse from its platter, growing more conspicuous as the minutes ticked away.After class, while waiting for Halmoni to pick me up, I devoured as many of those rainbow morsels as I could, as if disappearing them might also disappear my shame.But together on our road trip, my family and I ate gimbap with spirited abandon: while playing I spy, mountain peaks unzipping in the distance; or when my sister swerved the minivan to dodge a squirrel, causing both the tires and Umma to screech. We kept snacking, at Motel 6s and Holiday Inns; before the cone geysers punched the ice blue sky with pillars of water and steam. Or, pool-pruned after swimming, the salty tinge of chlorine and sesame oil left lingering on our lips. We stretched the gimbap to Keystone, South Dakota, where we climbed Mount Rushmore\u2019s Presidential Trail until those heavens-high faces came into view, jutting from stone. Then we piled back into the van and headed for home.More than two decades later, I find myself waking some mornings with an almost primal longing for gimbap. Time has a way of holding a mirror to the past, and now I see our food, and that road trip, in a new light.Historically speaking, gimbap is Frankenfood\u2014a resourceful hodgepodge creation. When mass starvation ravaged South Korea after the war, shelf-stable products skyrocketed in demand. Preserved and canned meats were only available via the U.S. Army base PX, or post exchange. A black market surfaced where opportunists snatched up and resold prized American-made products, everything from Ritz crackers to bubble gum, bread machines to blenders. The destitute could only dream of obtaining Spam, Vienna sausages, and hot dogs to supplement their kimchi and rice. Long after the war my grandparents still treasured those sodium-saturated mystery meats. They signify a time of salvaged pleasure, reminding us of the precious things not to be wasted.And, as it turns out, my mother\u2019s constant frown had not been an expression of disappointment but rather of grief. She had afforded me what she could not access when first moving to America in 1976: assimilation so seamless we often did not understand each other\u2019s needs. Yes, she\u2019d called this country home, yet her appetite would always belong elsewhere. My grandmother knew this. Gimbap had been a way, without words, to quell us all.These days my family is spread across the globe, from Brussels to the Deep South (where my mother now lives). In July I relocated to Oklahoma for an artist fellowship, and Umma and I made a road trip out of the move. We roamed through five states, once again admiring\u2014from a safe distance\u2014the tourist fodder of cross-country travel (the world\u2019s largest office chair, the alleged spinach capital of the world). I didn\u2019t want us to be without gimbap for the drive. That\u2019s why, one summer afternoon, I finally learned how to make the damn thing. Though I do not have children of my own, it frightens me to think certain family traditions may end because of my own fatuous inaction.My mother and I prepped the ingredients together. Our process lacked Halmoni\u2019s grace: \u201cThinner! Thinner!\u201d Umma barked, inspecting my carrot knife work. I whittled the slivers down to the size of pine needles but tore the egg pancake, which did not go unseen. Umma flagged these errors while quartering the hot dogs, finding time to demand that I replenish her ros\u00e9.The first roll turned out a real dud, the gim too loose, each cut piece unwinding like a nautilus. We took turns with the work, testing the frayed ends until the crunch and taste returned: for my mother, a memory of springtime class picnics in Seoul when she washed down each bite with Chilsung Cider, shaded by a riot of cherry blossoms; for me, International Day, sitting curbside in my hanbok, devouring each morsel before Halmoni arrived to take me home.Umma was quiet now. Soon our third and fourth rolls didn\u2019t look too shabby, and as I squeezed taut the final batch, I noticed how familiar my grip on the bamboo mat suddenly appeared\u2014the slender fingers and map of veins\u2014my hands, my mother\u2019s hands, and my grandmother\u2019s, all the same.Jennifer Hope Choi is a writer and editor.
