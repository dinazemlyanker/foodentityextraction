The majority of my childhood, I would tell people I was Russian. They would ask where I was from\u2014regardless of the fact that I was born in New York\u2014after hearing my mom\u2019s thick accent or learning of my dad\u2019s name, Boris, or seeing my brown-bag lunches of chopped liver sandwiches or butter and caviar black bread tartines. It wasn\u2019t until much later, in high school even, that I realized that wasn\u2019t entirely true. I\u2019m Latvian Ukrainian, a fact I now take deep pride in.This past week, after the entire world watched as Putin invaded Ukraine, the hashtag #cookforukraine began trending on Instagram. The movement\u2014in which chefs seek to raise both awareness of Ukrainian cuisine and money for various aid organizations\u2014was started by London-based chefs and authors Olia Hercules and Alissa Timoshkina, two people Trina and I greatly respect and admire for their thoughtful and comprehensive support of Ukrainian and Russian culture and cuisine. We\u2019ve since seen many fundraisers popping up all across the world, selling cheesecakes, hosting piroshki pop-ups, teaching virtual varenyky cooking classes, and donating millions of dollars to vital organizations such as Razom, World Central Kitchen, and UNICEF UK.From here in Brooklyn, Dacha 46 teamed up with 11 incredible local chefs to sell pastry boxes and raise funds for several organizations providing assistance to people in Ukraine, such as Razom, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC), and Nigerians in Diaspora Organisation. Each chef baked an Eastern European-inspired pastry, so we offered goods like strudel, piroshki, medovik, and mak bulochki\u2014and sold out in a matter of hours.Sometimes when you try to tame a fire, the flame only rages stronger. Putin\u2019s war hasn\u2019t just made the people of Ukraine stronger, it\u2019s united a community of proud Ukrainians dispersed around the world and made us more resolute in the fight for freedom. And as for Dacha 46, we fight with food. \u2014Jessica Quinn, pastry chef and co-owner of Dacha 46Here\u2019s a list of ongoing or upcoming food-related fundraisers and events.
