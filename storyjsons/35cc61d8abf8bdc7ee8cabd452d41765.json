It was late July and, in Iowa, that meant walls of sticky humidity. Which meant major swamp-ass and serious chub-rub between my thighs.\u201cI have a secret to tell you,\u201d Boyfriend said. \u201cBut, you can\u2019t get mad\u2014and, you can\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d I replied breathlessly. I wanted more than anything to be his unconditional confidant.\u201cI\u2019m turned on by big bellies. Like really fat women and pregnant women,\u201d he divulged, almost whispering. \u201cI watch videos of obese girls eating huge portions of food. It\u2019s like porn.\u201dA baby feminist without a grasp of kink or fetish cultures, I was immediately floored. I\u2019d spent my whole life being told I wasn\u2019t thin enough. Now the man I loved was telling me I wasn\u2019t large enough to be his fantasy. Or, was I? What did he want from my body? Whatever the answer, I wanted to give it to him.Looking back, this moment is pretty exemplary of how I spent the first 25 years of my life. My body belonged to whomever loved me; I saw myself how they saw me. And they usually saw a fat-ass. Someone they could inflict with their own deeply held insecurities. A body they could loathe.My grotesque dieting routines\u2014800-calorie-a-day benders, weeks without carbs, fruit, sugar, meat, whatever\u2014were complicated by my emerging desires. As I got older, wiser, and very aware of kink, I began to feel impulses off the hetero path. In my early twenties, my conservative, Christian upbringing collided with the radical dyke I was becoming. They were both ferocious. My body felt totally out of my control. The worst part of this whole tug-of-war was that I loved food. I loved making it, reading about it, and most of all, writing about it; even my senior thesis was about underground food cultures at a women\u2019s prison.I eventually came out\u2014brashly\u2014as pansexual and cooked gorgeous dinners for my partner while secretly enrolling in Weight Watchers. I preached hard about the powerful, political relationships between women, femmes, non-binary people, and food, all while quietly having an affair with diet culture. I felt like a hypocrite. I couldn\u2019t admit that I was starving for a connection with my body.Her cooking practices weren\u2019t about innovation or molecules; they were about treating yourself well.I divorced my partner during another sweltering July, rife with chub-rub. I filled my emptiness with delivery food and gallons of Chardonnay, adding intoxication to my self-flagellation, maxing out my credit cards on pizza and hate-watching Sex and the City. I stopped caring about dieting; I stopped caring entirely about what happened to me.But, then a small internet miracle happened. I\u2019d been watching some tragic music video on YouTube when an episode of Barefoot Contessa began to auto-play. I\u2019d remembered my mom\u2019s friends talking about Ina Garten, and while I loved watching the Food Network as a kid, I always changed the channel during her show because she lacked the pizzaz of Alton Brown.Now, though, Ina\u2019s pastel sense of cool and subtle deviance felt soothing. She looked at her husband like she looked at dessert\u2014she and Jeffrey are wild about each other\u2014and offered a well-dressed brand of hedonism that instantly allured my sick mind and body. Ina somehow mastered what I\u2019d been longing for all along: an unapologetic appetite, a body that took up ample space, an eager desire to love and be loved on equal terms, and an ability to show all of that through food.In Roxane Gay\u2019s memoir, Hunger, she writes, \u201cWhat I love most about Ina is that she teaches me about fostering a strong sense of self and self-confidence. She teaches me about being at ease in my body.\u201d That\u2019s precisely the remedy The Barefoot Contessa provided me.As I fell down this cooking video rabbit-hole, I also rediscovered Nigella Lawson. It\u2019s impossible to ignore Nigella\u2019s visceral, physical approach to eating. On Nigella Bites, she sticks her fingers in the sauce, wipes smears from her kids\u2019 faces, and eats midnight leftovers in her pajamas. In my mind, her recipes were acts of radical self-indulgence. Her cooking practices weren\u2019t about innovation or molecules; they were about treating yourself well.As I read more about Lawson, I discovered that she, too, had a vexed relationship with food and her body. She once told Australia's Sunday Telegraph Style, \u201cMy mother had an eating disorder, so I felt very strongly that I was not going to be tyrannised in that way. Also, if you've known three people you love very much die of cancer, you do not equate extreme thinness with healthiness.\u201dSo often, women and femmes are made to separate their pleasure from their power.It\u2019s tricky talking about pleasure and Nigella Lawson because horny straight men so often start the conversation. For example, if you watch this clip of Jay Leno\u2019s 2003 interview with her, you\u2019ll encounter some mind-numbing misogyny at work. What I see in Lawson is a woman who is very plugged into how food, sex, and pleasure all overlap. Her recipe index includes \u201cSlut Red Raspberries in Chardonnay Jelly,\u201d and the description reads like Anais Nin: \u201cThis is heaven on the plate: the wine-soused raspberries take on a stained glass, lucent red, their very raspberriness enhanced; the soft, translucently pale coral just-set jelly in which they sit has a heady, floral fragrance that could make a grateful eater weep.\u201d So often, women and femmes are made to separate their pleasure from their power, but Lawson keeps them both close at hand and uses food to bring them together.Both Nigella and Ina offered me revelation, a means of acknowledging that I\u2019d been starving for a sense of self, for physical intimacy, for fat. It was as if they were telling me, \u201cThis is what it looks like to act on desire \u2014 all of your appetites. Give it a try.\u201d They taught me that resistance to oppressive gender roles begins in the kitchen. Of course, putting this power into motion is challenging\u2014it requires a special blend of vulnerability and chutzpah that\u2019s in direct conflict with the cultural messages I receive all day long. And it\u2019s a lifelong change that requires a tribe. Nigella and Ina led me to Lindy West, to the #fatacceptance pages of Instagram, and to the practice of intuitive eating. In my own recovery from diet culture, Nigella and Ina operate as vision boards, voices I turn to when the outside noise becomes overwhelming. I can always turn on an episode when I need to feel better in my skin.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIna GartenessayRead MoreLifestyleThis Diner Is a Queer Oasis in the California DesertBy MacKenzie Chung FeganRecipes you want to make.
