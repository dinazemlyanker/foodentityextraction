But ya know what else isn\u2019t timely? This incredible Italian salad. It\u2019s a classic\u2014old school to the max. And it\u2019s so good that it\u2019s worth planning an elaborate dinner party around. Allow me to explain.First: You make some friends. Then, via text or a 15-message thread email chain, you invite them over for Sunday supper. On Saturday, you make the rag\u00f9 for eggplant parm. On Sunday, you fry the eggplant, shred mounds of cheese, and bake the gigantic eggplant parm. It takes forever to make, I\u2019m not gonna lie. But have you seen this thing?! Obviously it\u2019s worth it. And everything else on this brilliant menu is so easy it\u2019s laughable, but I say that about everything because I believe life, on the whole, is very funny. Let\u2019s see what you think.The eggplant parm in question.\nAlex LauThe sides: garlic bread and iceberg salad with Italian dressing. That\u2019s right. Nothing but the hits. Garlic bread should be fairly self-explanatory, but if you need a recipe, this one is solid.At the end of the day, it\u2019s that Italian salad that ends up stealing the show. No one sees it coming. It\u2019s iceberg! This thing hasn\u2019t had a break this big since the Titanic. It\u2019s crispy shards of water. And it\u2019s just the thing you need after all that fried, cheesy eggplant. But the dressing is the thing. It doesn\u2019t need to be nearly as good as it is.Mayonnaise, white wine vinegar, dried oregano, sugar (it doesn\u2019t make it sweet, don\u2019t freak out), garlic, salt, and pepper. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s creamy yet tangy, full of red sauce joint Italian flavor. It wishes a celebrity chef would bottle it for profit. That oregano is transporting. It takes you back to Olive Garden, Carrabba\u2019s, that red-lettered place in the strip mall, grandma\u2019s linoleum-floored kitchen\u2014wherever your nostalgia for \u201chouse salad\u201d originates. A person I made it for once said that it reminded him of the salad dressing you get at pizza places. I could go on and on, but it\u2019s very good salad dressing and I\u2019ve got things to do.But that\u2019s not all, folks! As if crispy iceberg and the ultimate better-than-bottled dressing wasn\u2019t enough, a casual handful of peperoncini drops in, as well as provolone cheese, mozzarella balls, and thinly sliced red onion. Together, with the garlicky dressing, you have something all salads aspire to be: not terrible.Get the recipe:Iceberg Salad with Italian DressingIf this brings back memories of the \u201chouse salad\u201d from that Italian-American restaurant you grew up eating at, then we consider our jobs done.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titItalian AmericanSalad DressingMayonnaiseBasicallyNever FailRecipes you want to make.
