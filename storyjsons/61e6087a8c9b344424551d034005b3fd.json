Or before/after a comedy show at Second City across the street. This is one of the best bars in America\u2014if not, the best. Roger Ebert said it. You might run into Bill Murray when he\u2019s in town. Michael Shannon watched his own movie win an Oscar at the bar. Is that random assortment of dudes not enough to convince you yet?ORDER: a cold bottle of Miller High Life. A pint of Bells Two-Hearted. Daisy Cutter. A vodka soda, if you must.THE VIBE IS: historic. This local haunt isn\u2019t just a dive bar; it\u2019s a museum. Impressive, prolific oil portraiture of (often) naked, scandalized politicians, as well as bar regulars, cover every inch of wall space. Of note, as if you\u2019d miss it: Sarah Palin, in her birthday suit, above the 60-year-old mahogany bar. Old Town Ale House has a friendly neighborhood crowd, with more life experience. Those looking for a bar with huge flat screens and shot specials can hit the Disneyland of sports bars around the block on Wells.WORD TO THE WISE: There\u2019s a quiet moment in the early evening, 5 p.m. or so, when the booths in the window seats have a warm glowing light that can\u2019t be beat. Then wander down to Orso\u2019s on Wells when you need crispy, tavern-style pizza to bring you back to life.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day: Monday to Friday, from 3 p.m. to 4 a.m.; Saturday, from noon to 5 a.m.; and Sunday, from noon to 4 a.m. It\u2019s cash only. Bring extra for the jukebox. Don\u2019t let it go silent.\u2014Alex BeggsMatt HaasWE ALSO LOVESportsman's ClubThe best indoor/outdoor bar for simple/spot-on cocktailsRichard's BarStrike dive-bar gold at this cash-only Chicago classicScofflawChicago\u2019s cocktail obsession (with some PBR, too)Explore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
