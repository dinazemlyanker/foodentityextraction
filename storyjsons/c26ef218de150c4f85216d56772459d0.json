While Castrej\u00f3n recommends chanterelle mushrooms for their \u201cchewy texture that satisfies, like a meat filling,\u201d almost any combination of mushrooms, torn or cut into bite-size pieces, works well in this recipe. Toss the mushrooms energetically to ensure the spice mix gets into all the nooks and crannies. As good as the seasoned mushrooms are, the tacos really come alive with the toppings, so don\u2019t sleep on those.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

We added some smoked paprika with some spice blends neighbors have given us. It turned out delicious! Although it looked like a lot of mushrooms, mushrooms cook down. So just cook them all ;) you will want another taco ;)MadelineReno, NV3/2/2022Delicious and simple! If availability or affordability of nice shrooms is an issue, subbing potatoes diced to 1/2\" cubes  is also tasty. Just lower the over temp to 350/375 to afford longer time and to prevent burning the adobo spice paste.AlexAtlanta, Georgia12/10/2021So so good. New go-to for a quick, meatless meal.AnonymousMilwaukee, WI12/9/2021This recipe was so good! I had to leave them baking a it less because my oven doesn\u2019t work that well. Left them baking for 16-18 min and they turned out amazing! Huber Lopez California 11/24/2021Agreed w/ Alaska that this was more of a paste than a marinade.  Allso, cut the salt, and it was appropriately salty for my needs. I also added 2 TBS orange juice to lighten the mixture. Then, what I've often seen on Bon Ap--tear the mushrooms rather than chop them. Had radishes, but didn't see a good \"fit\". Also  didn't have any cilantro today. So.I did a (sprinlkle) of salt on thinly sliced red onions, drained and rninsed tnem) quartered grape tomatoes, added  sour cream & guac.  Now?  Whenever mushrooms are on sale? I'll experiment with the Spanish and Fiipino versions. \n\nLucidaBoston11/3/2021This recipe came out super good and since my oven isn\u2019t kind of finicky and sometimes gets to hot even when I set it to a certain F I had to watch carefully until they got golden and crispy I took them out. It was more like 18 in the oven. Esther dawn San Diego, CA10/29/2021Spice mixture is more of a paste, so mushrooms turned out very dry.   Had to compensate with sour cream and salsa to add moisture.  AnonymousAnchorage, AK10/27/2021 This sounds really good, and I will be making these soon. How do you make the shells crispy without being chewy.  Thank you for the recipe. Linda Malnati Ontario California10/24/2021I just found ten large hen of the woods mushrooms and i really needed recipes ! This one was amazing ! Ill be making this often !
