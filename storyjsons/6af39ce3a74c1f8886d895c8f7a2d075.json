When something's so easy to make that you don't even need one. Welcome to It's That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.I owe my love of coconut chutney to one person: my chithi pati (maternal grandmother\u2019s sister). The first time I had her coconut chutney, alongside dosa, was when I studied abroad in India a few years ago. It was a sultry October day and I walked into my chithi pati\u2019s apartment in Mumbai. She asked if I was hungry. \u201cNo, Vimala chithi, I\u2019m okay.\u201d Silently, she trod off into the kitchen and began cooking anyway.Before the COVID lockdowns, I used to just go home for real South Indian food. But with travel restrictions, I\u2019ve been trying to re-create that same food in my apartment. I\u2019ve made this coconut chutney\u2014a Tamil speciality and, for me, a gift from my Vimala chithi pati who lives across the ocean\u2014more than a dozen times.Coconut chutney comes in white and green varieties. In order to make white chutney, you usually need fresh coconut, but considering the constraints of living in New England and being enrolled in school, I find the green version, made with frozen grated coconut, to be much more attainable. (Since white coconut chutney relies on the coconut for the entirety of its flavor, on the other hand, it\u2019s important to have the freshest coconut meat available\u2014frozen doesn\u2019t cut it.) Traditionally, chutneys are made using a mortar and pestle, but for my purposes, a food processor or blender suffices.To make it, start by washing 1 bunch cilantro, chopping the leaves and tender stems, and discarding the bottom few inches of the stems which tend to be tougher. Add cilantro to a food processor or blender along with 4\u20135 small green chiles (or \u201chari mirchi\u201d) and a squeeze of lemon or lime juice to smooth out the mixture. Once green chile seeds have been visibly broken up, add about \u00bd cup frozen grated coconut, thawed, along with 1 teaspoon kosher salt and 2\u20133 tablespoons whole-milk yogurt (preferably desi yogurt, which is more sour than other types of yogurt). Taste the mixture: It should be salty and sour. Add approximately 1 teaspoon tamarind concentrate (this gives the chutney its characteristic sourness) and blend until smooth, adding more coconut and tamarind to taste. Eat immediately or transfer to an airtight container\u2014it will last for about 1 week in the fridge.I like to eat my green chutney on sourdough toast with fresh ricotta, on crackers as an afternoon snack, or alongside instant dosas (I use the MTR instant mix). To be honest though, I\u2019ll be counting down the days until I can see my chithi pati again. There really is nothing like fresh green coconut chutney alongside a homemade dosa, especially when it comes from someone who loves you.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimplecookingRecipes you want to make.
