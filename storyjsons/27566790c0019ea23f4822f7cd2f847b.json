Owner Elizabeth Bryan actually used to live in this quirky space before it was rezoned to serve food. You\u2019ll see her carrying out plates of barbecue pork and grits, meatloaf sandwiches, and slices of coconut cream pie to Dock Lunch customers she knows (or will soon know) by name.ORDER THE: one of two to five daily specials from the handwritten menu on the wall, plus a slice of whatever Bryan has baked for dessert. (She\u2019s got a fondness for Southern cooking.) She\u2019ll post offerings on Instagram and Facebook, then sell out pretty quickly, usually before 3 p.m. If there\u2019s lemonade when you first walk in, go for it.THE VIBE IS: like you\u2019ve accidentally wandered into someone\u2019s vintage-inspired living room, with mismatched furniture, pink drapes, and bookshelves you can browse while you wait for your lunch.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Tuesday to Friday, from noon to 4 p.m., and Saturday to Sunday, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Closed Monday. Walk-ins are welcome, and try not to be late\u2014when she\u2019s out, she\u2019s out! She also serves dinner on Friday, from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m., so call 604-879-DOCK to reserve ahead.\u2014Lindsay AndersonGrant HarderGrant HarderGrant HarderWE ALSO LOVE33 Acres BreweryCalifornia meets the Pacific Northwest and the result is this breezy Mount Pleasant breweryBeta5A Mount Pleasant sweets shop pushing cacao boundaries since 2011The AcornFine-dining in Mount Pleasant that just happens to not include meatExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
