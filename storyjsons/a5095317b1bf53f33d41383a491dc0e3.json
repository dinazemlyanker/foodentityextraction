Well, almost anything. Maybe not a doorstop or a cellphone or an affordable, efficient form of public transportation. But when it comes to cooking? Yeah, it\u2019s good for everything. Yukon Golds are perfect for mashing, blanching, frying, and most of all, roasting. In fact, Yukon Golds are the best potatoes for roasting out there. Here\u2019s what makes them so great:The Starchy-to-Waxy SpectrumRussets are very starchy. Fingerlings are super waxy. The starchier the potato, the better for frying. The waxier the potato, the better for mashing or boiling. Yukon Golds fall right in the middle of the spectrum. There\u2019s enough waxiness to hold their shape and develop nice caramelization on the outsides, while simultaneously having enough starch to make the interior creamy, silky, and luxuriously buttery. This is the real beauty of the Yukon Gold, what makes them the best potatoes for roasting. The crisp. The creaminess. The texture.Thin-SkinnedThinner skin means heat can get all up inside that potato more quickly. Less time hanging around, waiting for your 'taters to cook is a good thing in our book.
