On Every Other, I've Got Smashed Chickpea SaladIt loves me at my best and props me up at my worst.\u00a0By Aliza AbarbanelMarch 6, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Emma Fishman, Food Styling by Pearl JonesFacebookTwitterEmailThe only thing better than a good recipe? When something's so easy to make that you don't even need one. Welcome to It's That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.Five or six times a year, I get my life together. I pile sweet potatoes onto sheet trays. I wash huge leafy bundles of kale. I stand over my stove simmering beans that I remembered to soak the night before and bask in the satisfaction of prepping a week of healthy, relatively inexpensive lunches.The rest of the time, I rely on a decidedly less civilized strategy: Pray my dinner yields enough leftovers for lunch and scavenge in the Test Kitchen when it doesn\u2019t. But now I have a third strategy: smashed chickpea salad.Smashed chickpea salad is the sole reason why I keep an extra can of chickpeas on the top shelf of my pantry. It\u2019s my fallback plan when it\u2019s 11 p.m. and I\u2019m overcome with the urge to break my bad habits and pack my own damn lunch. It comes together in minutes, uses whatever I have on hand, and makes a seriously tasty lunch.I start by rinsing and draining the chickpeas in that can, and then I use the back of a wooden spoon to roughly smash 75% of them. (A potato masher would work even better, but I don\u2019t own one. If you have one, use it! I salute you.) I like to leave some chickpeas intact for textural variation, but mashing most of them helps hold the sandwich together.Then I mix in all the other ingredients. When I say \u201cother ingredients,\u201d I\u2019m being purposefully vague. Rather than get stuck on specifics, I aim for a one or two mix-ins from each of these categories:Something briny/acidic: capers, pepperoncini, half-sour pickles; when all else fails, a lot of lemon juice does the trick.Something punchy/sharp: sliced scallions, grated garlic, flaked smoked trout, harissa, almost-too-many red pepper flakes\u2014the goal is to add flavor!Something creamy/rich: a good dollop of Greek yogurt, tahini, organic mayo, Dijon mustard, leftover green goddess or tahini ranch; add in a drizzle of olive oil or an additional spoonful of your chosen creamy condiment if things look dryAfter everything\u2019s combined, I add some salt and cracked black pepper and tweak the levels of acid and spice until it tastes intense and bright.Sometimes I eat my smashed chickpea salad as is, but most of the time, I make it a sandwich. To ward off Soggy Sandwich Syndrome, I bring the salad to work in a little container, sometimes along with sliced cucumbers or quick-pickled carrots, and pack up a separate container of toast (or toast-like things) to serve underneath the salad: Toasted sourdough, rice cakes (I like this tamari with seaweed flavor), or Norwegian crisp bread, sturdy crackers. When lunchtime comes, I assemble.It goes without saying that smashed chickpea salad is more than just a panic lunch. It\u2019s a great weeknight dinner, and it can certainly be planned in advance. But I\u2019ll tuck that extra can of chickpeas on a high shelf in the hopes that I won\u2019t accidentally use it for herbed or spiced chickpeas. I can never predict when I\u2019ll need to turn it into lunch, but its time will come.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimpleRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
