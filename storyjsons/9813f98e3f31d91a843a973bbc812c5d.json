The spice from the chopped kimchi in the fritter batter and the gochujang yogurt dipping sauce offset the natural sweetness of the sweet potatoes. A great appetizer or an indulgent snack, these are best eaten right away. If you\u2019re feeling extra-ambitious, make your own homemade kimchi too. \u2014Diana YenAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

They would be amazing and have way more crunch.  I love falafel, but my least favorite part of the sandwhich is the falafel itself.  ;)  Thanks for this inspiration!
