I was filled with inspiration and energy, wowing myself with fresh, complex, joyful meals. But like many I burned out quickly, and my extravagant lunches soon became a tub of hummus and a bag of baby carrots.Just as I was at my lowest point of sad lunches, I sought inspiration on TikTok and YouTube. As I scrolled through food content, my algorithm introduced me to folks making bento, beautifully packed lunchbox-style meals of Japanese origin, for themselves and their loved ones. \u201cIn Japanese culture, bento is thought to transmit the feelings of the preparer to the receiver through food,\u201d says the Japanese American TikToker Tiffoodss, who makes bento videos. \u201cWhen bento is packed with love, that care is communicated to the receiver upon eating the bento.\u201dTikTok contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.The traditional boxes are hand carved from wood and often filled with rice, a protein, and vegetables, neatly tetris'd. Modern boxes are often made from plastic or metal, and it\u2019s common for ingredients to get a social-media friendly update: fresh vegetables and fruit are cut into flowers or hearts, onigiri are skillfully shaped into cats and bears, little character toothpicks adorn snacks and other tiny bites. I pack my bento into a Bentgo box\u2014the sleek stainless steel design appeals to me, as does its airtight lid and leak-proof silicone seal. It also has a removable divider so you can craft your bento into separate sections.Bentgo Stainless Steel Bento Box$30 at AmazonOnigiri formsBento boxes often include onigiri, the traditional rice balls with assorted fillings like tuna mayo or umeboshi, a pickled plum.
