And that\u2019s not all: The chicken meatballs are smashed into a thin layer and topped with thinly sliced onion and jalape\u00f1o, yielding browned, juicy burgers juxtaposed with the sweetness and heat of the charred vegetables. Layer it all onto a toasty bun with the crispy bacon and as much ketchup as you please, then wonder how only a handful of ingredients brought such big flavor.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Working in 2 batches, toast hamburger buns, cut sides down, until golden, about 1 minute. Transfer to plates.Step 3Add half of the bacon to same skillet and cook until browned and crisp, about 2 minutes per side. Place 4 pieces on top of 2 of the bottom bun.Step 4Season 2 meatballs generously with salt and pepper. Place them far apart in skillet. Using a spatula, smash meatballs down as thin as you can (use another kitchen tool to drive the spatula down toward the skillet to help flatten the meat against it). Top each with about a quarter of the onion and the jalape\u00f1o; press into meat. Cook patties, untouched, until browned underneath, about 2 minutes. Flip over and cook until patties are cooked through and onion is golden, about 1 minute. Transfer patties to bottom buns with bacon. Repeat process with remaining bacon, chicken, onion, and jalape\u00f1o to make 2 more burgers.Step 5Close up hamburgers and serve with ketchup alongside.How would you rate Chicken-Bacon Smash Burgers?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleI really like the smashing technique with the onions and peppers on top which cook upon flipping, but found the recipe seemingly unfinished with ketchup a weird and minimal pairing. Adding some Mayo and lettuce was a must, and I think tomato would have been a nice addition but I didn\u2019t have any available.Erika Minneapolis MN USA 3/5/2022This was so delicious and super quick. I did step it up by serving it on homemade burger buns with some Bon Appetit slightly sweet quick pickled onions.  The mandoline really helped make the onion and jalapeno slices really thin and uniform.Julianne Renton Washington 2/20/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titDinnerLunch5 Ingredients or FewerOne-Pot MealsWeeknightEasyQuickNut-FreeDairy-FreeBurgerGround ChickenChickenPoultryBaconCured MeatMeatRecipes you want to make.
