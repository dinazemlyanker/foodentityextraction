Above them a large neon sign glowing blue and red reads \u201cPhocific Northwest.\u201d Seattle may be famous for coffee, but locals know it\u2019s this Vietnamese soup that really keeps the city running.Siblings Khoa, Quynh, and Yenvy Pham, proprietors of S\u00fap Shop in Seattle\u2019s Little Saigon neighborhood, grew up washing dishes and bussing tables in their parents\u2019 four pho shops. Their parents, Theresa Cat Vu and Augustine Nien Pham, were pioneers, opening their tiny red boat-shaped restaurant Ph\u1edf B\u1eafc in 1982, the first restaurant in what would eventually become a thriving Vietnamese area.\u201cWhile my parents worked in their shop, 15 hours a day, our day care center was a van in that parking lot out there,\u201d Khoa says.\u201cThey were so busy trying to open this restaurant, and they were so brave to do it,\u201d Quynh adds. \u201cTheir English was limited; their experience was zero. They didn\u2019t have babysitters, so they would just load all us kids in this van.\u201dNow the van is gone, and in its place the siblings have made S\u00fap Shop their domain.A spread of wings, pho, \u201cunfortunate cookie mix,\u201d and egg rolls at S\u00fap Shop.\nPhoto by Amber FoutsThough the building is owned by their parents, the decidedly modern Vietnamese restaurant is entirely the vision of the younger Phams, complete with a full bar, photobooth, and natural wine shop. Vietnamese pop music and videos play on screens above the long marble bar all day, and the design skews simple with a bit of flair: polished concrete floors, white subways tiles, gold light fixtures, a Vietnamese street food cart transformed into a host stand, as well as black leather and bamboo chairs (repurposed, much to their parents\u2019 delight, from another family restaurant).\u201cWe went through a lot of ideas\u2014late-night sandwich shop, dessert place, walk-up window,\u201d Khoa says. \u201cVietnamese restaurants in Little Saigon aren\u2019t really multigenerational businesses. So that transition is what we are trying to figure out\u2014what\u2019s the next step?\u201dThe wine shop inside S\u00fap Shop.\nPhoto by Amber FoutsEventually the Phams settled on a vision that speaks to tradition as well as innovation. They\u2019re serving pho, of course, but the menu is also heavy on appetizers and snacks that will be familiar and satisfying to the happy hour crowd\u2014of both the post-work and late-night varieties. Along with the family\u2019s famous peppery fried-to-order egg rolls (available with either pork, egg, and shrimp or tofu), there are sliders filled with nem n\u01b0\u1edbng, fermented pork sausage, pickled carrots, and slathered with herby lemongrass sauce. There are also twice-fried jumbo chicken wings doused in a sticky, tangy tamarind glaze and topped with crunchy fried shallots, a pile of which begs to be washed down with a cold Saigon Export beer (or, if you prefer, a West Coast IPA from local brewery Standard Brewing). For dessert, Yenvy is perpetually refining an affogato-like sundae made with Vietnamese coffee and a cinnamon-laced condensed milk sauce.As for the pho, the broths\u2014beef, chicken, and veggie\u2014don\u2019t stray from the family\u2019s traditional long-simmered recipes, but the siblings have made a few modifications.\u201cWe serve a short rib pho that has two giant bones. It\u2019s like the Flintstones bowl,\u201d Yenvy says. \u201cMom said we should cut the pieces small, but we said, \u2018Let\u2019s have it big!\u2019 It\u2019s our most popular item right now.\u201d (And in fact, Mom joins a crew of cooks for a few hours at S\u00fap Shop each day.)\u201cWe made it because it\u2019s good, because it\u2019s carnal and fun,\u201d Khoa says. \u201cTurns out it\u2019s also very Instagrammable.\u201dThat beef pho you\u2019ve heard so much about.\nPhoto by Amber FoutsIndeed, the broth alone\u2014imbued with the deep primordial flavor of beef bones, as well as star anise and clove\u2014could sate you, but satisfaction reaches a new level when you lift up an eight-inch-long rib and nibble fatty meat straight off it, the juices dribbling down your chin.Stop at the bar for a drink and you\u2019ll likely find yourself crunching your way through handfuls of S\u00fap Shop\u2019s signature bar snack the \u201cUnfortunate Cookie Mix,\u201d a Chex Mix\u2013like combination of shattered fortune cookies, peanuts, black sesame seeds, and chili oil. Its main component\u2014flat rejected, broken cookies\u2014comes directly from a local family-owned Chinese company, Tsue Chong, open since 1917, that makes noodles and cookies in a factory just down the street.Along with beer and cocktails, the Phams are pouring nearly a dozen wines\u2014all of them natural, low-intervention, and made by sustainable producers. Suzi An, who helped curate the wine list, also owns Vita Uva, a miniscule wine store consisting of two well-stocked shelves located within S\u00fap Shop (look for it between the doors to the kitchen and the hallway to the bathroom).\u201cI would never have had this opportunity if it wasn\u2019t for the Phams,\u201d An says. While An is a restaurant-industry veteran, she is also a first-time business owner who didn\u2019t have access to all the capital necessary to find, rent, and renovate retail space, as well as build inventory.\u201cI\u2019m lucky to be supported by this family, who are so entrepreneurial and encourage you to take chances,\u201d she says. \u201cI want wine to be approachable and familiar. What better way to do that in Seattle than through this platform of such a familiar soup?\u201d\u201cA lot of us are stuck in a mentality that you have to have this with a certain that,\u201d An continues. \u201cBut that\u2019s the beauty of food and beverage\u2014you can do what you want. Pair whatever you want with whatever you want.\u201dAnd playing with expectations is ultimately what S\u00fap Shop is all about.\u201cPeople still associate Vietnamese restaurants with just cheap eats or being a \u2018hole-in-the-wall,\u2019\u201d Quynh says. \u201cOur price point is reasonable, but you can come in, have a nice drink or glass of wine, eat a bowl of pho, have a different experience.\u201d\u201cBut we are just as chaotic and idealistic as our parents,\u201d Yenvy says. \u201cAnd the hustle is there too. That\u2019s embedded into the immigrant mentality.\u201dAngela Garbes is a Seattle-based food and culture writer.One final look at those wings before you go.\nPhoto by Amber FoutsCheck out some other great places in Seattle with our City Guide.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurants + TravelSeattlePhoVietnameseRecipes you want to make.
