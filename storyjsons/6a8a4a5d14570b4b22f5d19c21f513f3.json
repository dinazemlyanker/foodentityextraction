He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.When you work in the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen, you\u2019re not only expected to keep up on what\u2019s happening in food right this minute, you\u2019re expected to bring a piece of home with you to the office.Over the years, Rick Martinez has graced us with dad\u2019s refried beans, Gaby Melian schooled us in the ways of empanada-making, and Carla Lalli Music lobbied and lectured me on the magnificence that is the Feast of the Seven Fishes (eventually I saw the light and gave her the go ahead).Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Sohla El-Waylly, the newest member of the test kitchen team, figured she would bring one of her childhood favorites to BA: her mom\u2019s biryani. And that\u2019s when things got complicated.In order to make the dish as home cook\u2013friendly as possible, Sohla decided to switch from her mom\u2019s preferred lamb biryani to chicken. But then the assertive spices in the original\u2014mace, cubeb pepper, et al.\u2014overpowered the chicken thighs. Sohla was stumped.And it was at this point that Chris Morocco stepped in and suggested that she not try to replicate the dish she grew up with, but create something new, which is very much in the spirit of what we do here at BA, day in and day out.Photo by Adam Rapoport\u201cAfter Chris gave me that push, I felt confident to freestyle,\u201d Sohla says. \u201cI went with a basic korma vibe for my chicken marinade because it\u2019s simple and everyone likes it. And while my mom\u2019s biryani always has potatoes, I was juggling too many balls trying to perfectly par-cook both potatoes and rice for one dish. This omission allowed me to zero in on the rice\u2014the most important part of any biryani.\u201dThe result is a relatively simplified biryani that isn\u2019t long on ingredients, but still homes in on technique, allowing the home cook to achieve fluffy, fragrant basmati, deeply tender chicken, and just enough spices, caramelized onions, and ghee-toasted nuts to introduce irresistible flair.The recipe development process opened Sohla\u2019s eyes. \u201cThe main thing I\u2019ve taken away from breaking down biryani and really thinking about it is that it\u2019s all about the rice,\u201d she says. \u201cOnce you understand how to parboil rice, anything can be biryani. Steam rice over any saucy base\u2014chicken Tikka masala biryani, chicken adobo biryani, beef stroganoff biryani, randang curry biryani, goulash biryani\u2026\u201dBut if you want to make lamb biryani, you might have to DM Sohla\u2019s mom.Get the recipe:Chicken BiryaniThis satisfying rice dish can often be an elaborate, ambitious affair, but our version simplifies the process without sacrificing any complexity of flavor.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterChickenRiceRead MorecookingNot My Amu\u2019s Chicken Thigh BiryaniBy Sohla El-WayllycookingIt\u2019s Lamb Chops and Greek Salad for DinnerBy Adam RapoportcookingSteak and Potatoes Night in AmericaBy Adam RapoportcookingBroccoli Bolognese Is an Anywhere, Anytime PastaBy Adam RapoportRecipes you want to make.
