I never would have paired lemon zest with apples but it really brings out their flavor and adds a uniqueness that is so yummy!ErinMNY2/20/2022Great, healthier muffins. We replaced the coconut oil with butter due to an allergy and the maple syrup (ran out at home) with honey. Added a bit allspice based on someone else's suggestion. Very dense, rich compared to regular muffins, you have to be OK with it.  MBLiberty Lake, WA9/18/2021Great muffins . Be good if you gave the calories .P.C.Rotorua NZ7/26/2021I was really excited to try a gluten-free muffin with so many positive reviews. Unfortunately I found them way too sweet and the coconut oil too rich. It was a good idea and possibly with some alterations I would like it better but I am not sure it is worth the effort. Anonymous1/12/2021I really enjoyed baking this recipe! I had whole wheat flour to use, so I used that instead of oat. I added in a handful of sliced strawberries and rhubarb I had to use up as well as the apples. Tasty recipe! I also didn't have almonds so I used walnuts. \nSo in other words, I didn't follow the recipe perfectly, but I liked the result and would make them again! Thanks Bon Appetit. Only reason I gave 4 out of 5 that I don't typically have all these items in my pantry at one time. AnonymousVancouver4/23/2020Delicious! I altered the recipe a bit because I had overripe bananas to use. Substituted 3 small bananas for the oil, added a pinch of allspice, and substituted 1 cup of all purpose flour for oat. Really love the fluffy texture and rise of the muffins.AnonymousWashington, DC3/30/20205 Stars cannot justify the rating deserved by these flawlessly delicious muffins! Thank you for allowing me to add a little sunshine to my wife's day!AnonymousArizona8/8/2019This was fantastic, and highly versatile. I added in a ripe banana that needed to be used up. I also halved the maple syrup (really didn't need that much) and added a generous dash of allspice (I prefer it to cinnamon). Cooked for the full 30 mins and could've gone a little longer just to brown the bottoms fully. I used slivered almonds instead of sliced, and I loved the texture they added. Made my own oat and almond flours by pulsing in the food processor, so this was all done with pantry staples.Anonymous12/14/2018These are delicious! My only feedback is that the recipe and article mention cinnamon, but cinnamon is not actually listed as an ingredient. I added both cinnamon and brown sugar in the oat topping to make them more savory, and I used a full 8oz of grated apple. Will make againAnonymousDallas, TX10/29/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titMuffinPastriesAppleFruitOatRice & GrainsAlmond FlourFlourAlmondNutFlaxseed MealSnackDairy-FreeGluten-FreeVegetarianHealthyishBakingBreakfastRecipes you want to make.
