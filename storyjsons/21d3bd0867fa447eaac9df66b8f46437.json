Striding across the street in fashionably chunky, borderline orthopedic Chanel sneakers, she enthusiastically recommends grabbing breakfast at The Smile. (It\u2019s right around the corner! Her husband, Danish musician Mikkel C. Hess, sometimes records down the street!) Plus, they\u2019re fine with dogs. Hidden amidst her very Manhattanite tangle of bags sits Ojas, a calm yet alert chihuahua-terrier mix who, not coincidentally, shares a name with Kehar\u2019s new cookbook: OJAS: Modern Recipes and Ancient Wisdom for Everyday Ayurveda.Kehar has worn many hats, most notably as the chef-owner of Chez Nini in New Delhi. In 2014, she self-published Eating Stories, an art book made to accompany her dinner at the James Beard Foundation. The new cookbook combines recipes for mindfully made food with the Ayurvedic practices that have guided her life.Kehar grew up in Montreal, where she spent her childhood in her local library reading Paramahansa Yogananda\u2019s Autobiography of a Yogi\u2014a 500+ page tomb she describes as \u201cmy version of Harry Potter.\u201d  She attended culinary school in Quebec, completed a three-month culinary internship in New Delhi, and stayed for over a decade. There she opened the French brasserie Chez Nini, which drew crowds and press with chic decor and spiced coq a vin.After six years, Kehar left Chez Nini to return to the subject of her childhood daydreams: Ayurveda. \u201cWhen you tell someone you\u2019re a chef, they immediately share stories with you and trust you,\u201d Kehar says. \u201cI felt that trust warrants really mindful cooking, and the stuff we love to eat every day has to be able to be Ayurvedic.\u201dOjas the dog\nPhoto by Emma FishmanAyurveda is rooted in connection to the inner self, the people around us, and the world we all share. Accordingly, OJAS divides the calendar year into twelve distinct seasons, each named for a house of the zodiac. It\u2019s a kind of hyper-seasonal eating that puts most farm-to-table restaurants to shame. Also, the celestial imagery and vibrantly hued recipe photos are stunning\u2014beautiful enough to imagine using it as an especially useful 250+ page coffee table book.Kehar\u2019s recipes combine mainstays of traditional Ayurvedic cooking with the high-impact, imaginative cooking found at restaurants today. Chicken liver confit with urad dal curry is precluded by an herby spring khichdi, a riffable and restorative stew that\u2019s a cornerstone of Ayurvedic eating. Early fall brings a recipe for onion ring poutine\u2014a mainstay of Chez Nini meant to be consumed in Libra season, which Kehar notes is the appropriate time to indulge in \u201cmore mindfully made poutine.\u201dAs many people in search of wellness eliminate ingredients with the frequency and speed of deleting emails, the inclusion of poutine (albeit poutine made from coconut flour and ghee), is refreshing. Kehar says she\u2019s frequently approached by people searching for health, but completely overwhelmed by the multitude of diets and online dialogue. \u201cDon\u2019t make any hard and fast rules or be too rigid with yourself about anything,\u201d she says. \u201cListen to that little voice and take things that work for you\u2014and also be willing to be a little bit strict about certain things.\u201d This acknowledged flexibility carries over into the book (some recipes pair fruit and dairy, which is commonly thought to be incompatible), and into Kehar\u2019s own life as well. Between bites of her bagel plate, she brings up her love of wine, and her calm eyes crinkle in an easy smile.Over the course of her own Ayurvedic education, Kehar was particularly inspired by the teachings of David Frawley and chef Richard LaMarita, who introduced her to the concept of ojas: the vital life force that guides body and mind. \u201cA lot of people want to disassociate yoga or Ayurveda from a spiritual aspect. It\u2019s not dogmatic or religious, but it is spiritual,\u201d says Kehar. \u201cSpirituality doesn\u2019t [necessarily] have to do with religion. It has to do with a love and connection to yourself. When your higher purpose becomes achieving and climbing a ladder that is fictional, it takes you out of your body. So then it\u2019s like, \u2018Okay, what am I doing? Am I in my body? What do I like to eat?\u2019\u201dKehar believes wellness means finding a path back to our natural selves, and she sees OJAS as a way to build the necessary knowledge and intuition. Despite its heavy binding and gold-lined pages, her book is not a bible. Rather, it is a foundation for pursuing happiness by rebuilding a connection to our inner selves\u2014and who doesn\u2019t want that?When we climb up from the restaurant\u2019s sunken entrance to the street above, it feels like my mind has been freshly laundered and hung out to dry in the sun. The small, anxious corner of my mind, often rabid for self-improvement but overwhelmed by action, is quiet. I go home and page through OJAS, looking for what sticks. I call it intuition.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishChefsCookbooksprofileRead MorecultureWhat to Eat for How You Feel and Other Lessons From an Ayurvedic ChefBy Rachel Sugar Recipes you want to make.
