The grape-distilled spirit was disguised in a sugary green mixed drink that seasoned millennials may know as the Incredible Hulk\u2014equal parts Hennessy and Hpnotiq, famed at P. Diddy\u2019s erstwhile Justin\u2019s Restaurant in Atlanta. From the first sip the essence of prunes took over my senses. I declared then and there that I was not a cognac lover.Once I became a bartender, I learned about rancio, a chemical process that occurs naturally as cognac ages in oak barrels\u2014and creates that dried fruit flavor I initially disliked. But the more I experimented, the more fascinated I became with how cognac\u2019s aromas and flavors would change depending on whether I mixed it with other ingredients or poured it over ice.A type of brandy that comes only from the Cognac region of France, cognac is classified based on how long it spends in those oak barrels: VS (Very Special), at least two years; VSOP (Very Superior Old Pale), at least four years; and XO (Extra Old), at least 10. A young cognac might have accents of red roses, underripe bananas, and stone fruit, making it perfect for cocktails, but age mellows it into a smooth, dark, deeply flavored sipper.Cognac has been popular in sweet punches since the 18th century; the key is finding harmonious ingredients that accent the spirit\u2019s complexity rather than masking it. In this recipe, that means fresh lemon juice and a creamy herb-kissed pineapple syrup that\u2019ll transport you somewhere warm and tropical, which is ideal for the holidays\u2014no matter where you actually are.\u00a0Which cognac should you use for cocktails?Pierre Ferrand is unparalleled for its quality and price point. Try the fruity 1840 Original Formula, developed especially for mixing, or choose the Ambre\u0301, which at 10 years old could be labeled an XO, for a smoother, richer cocktail.Ferrand 1840 Original Formula Cognac$50 at Reserve BarFerrand Ambr\u00e9 Cognac$50 at Reserve BarMix it Up:Cognac Punch SwizzleCognac doesn\u2019t deserve to gather dust in the back of your liquor cabinet.
