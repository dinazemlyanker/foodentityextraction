Park\u2019s is king for a reason.ORDER THE: sweet-savory galbi, glistening pork belly, crispy seafood pancake, and, hell, the Wagyu, if you\u2019re ready to party with some ice-cold soju and the wonderful array of banchan.THE VIBE IS: pretty eclectic but very L.A. You\u2019ll find Korean families alongside K-pop stars, diplomats, and chefs sitting at tableside grills and under big metal tubes, like they\u2019re about to be beamed up to meaty heaven.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day: Sunday to Thursday, 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., and Friday and Saturday, 11 a.m. to midnight.\u2014Elyse InamineWE ALSO LOVEThe Walker InnFor when you want something quiet, cool, and intimate in KoreatownGrand Central MarketL.A.\u2019s best bites under one downtown roofRiceBarEverything\u2019s coming up rice bowls in downtown L.A.Explore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
