Chill leaves until ready to use.Thinly slice cucumbers crosswise on a diagonal. Chill until ready to use.Halve avocado and remove pit.

Squeeze second half of the lime over avocado; set aside.Heat olive oil in a medium skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high. Add remaining sliced scallions and cook, stirring occasionally with wooden spoon, until tender and golden, about 4 minutes.Add beef and break up into small pieces with wooden spoon. Let cook, undisturbed, until first side is browned, about 5 minutes.While meat is cooking, stir \u00bd cup mayonnaise and 3 Tbsp. Cholula Green Pepper Sauce in a small bowl and season lightly with salt; stir to combine then set aside. [NOTE: This amount of Cholula Green Pepper in the mayonnaise will give the mayonnaise a greenish tint.]Season meat with 1 tsp. kosher salt and stir, breaking up even more with wooden spoon into small bits. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until meat is cooked all the way through, about 4 minutes longer.Remove from heat and stir in 1 Tbsp. Cholula.

Spoon several tablespoons beef mixture into each leaf.Sprinkle lettuce cups with reserved scallions and squeeze reserved lime wedges over top. Sprinkle lightly with more salt and top with several more shakes of Cholula Green Pepper.Recipe by Cholula\u00ae Hot SauceRelated VideoThese Spicy Beef Lettuce Cups Are a Hit Any Night of the WeekReviews SectionReviewsWrite a review\u2026Delicious!
