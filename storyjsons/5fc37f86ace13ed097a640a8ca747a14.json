Do like the ancestors did\u2014work with what you gotBy Hilary CadiganJanuary 18, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhotograph by Emma FishmanFacebookTwitterEmailAsk Maricela Vega what drives her cooking and she\u2019ll talk about relationships. Relationships with farmers, with community, with family and ancestors and the earth itself. \u201cFood doesn\u2019t just magically appear,\u201d she says. \u201cI rely on so many to do what I do.\u201dFor the chef at Atlanta restaurant 8ARM and founder of Chicomeco\u0301atl, an organization centering Indigenous foodways, using mostly vegetables\u2014and only when they\u2019re local and in season\u2014is a form of empathy. Vega\u2019s strong farmer ties yield lush peach pound cakes in summer and crispy-cushiony squash empanadas come fall. \u201cIf you\u2019re eating a tomato in the middle of February, someone is feeling the consequence,\u201d she says. \u201cTo me, cooking well is about making the most of what\u2019s here now, and not asking for more.\u201dOf course, this philosophy is nothing new. It\u2019s the way people ate for millennia, before mechanization and monoculture became the norm, and its Indigenous roots run parallel to Vega\u2019s own. Her parents both come from farming families in Guanajuato, Mexico; they met washing clothes in the river that divided their villages. And though they didn\u2019t talk much about their Indigenous heritage during Vega\u2019s childhood (\u201cI think there used to be some shame there,\u201d she says), reclaiming it has become her personal mission as a chef. In the years since, she\u2019s traced corn\u2019s cultivation back to Mesoamerica and studied how modern agriculture both devastates the planet and relies heavily on exploitative immigrant labor, including that of her own uncles and cousins. \u201cIt\u2019s all connected,\u201d she says. \u201cYou need to learn from the past to create a better future.\u201dAnd that\u2019s what Vega does, both in 8ARM\u2019s tiny kitchen and the pages that follow, with healthy, seasonal, plant-based staples electrified by a colorful array of swappable condiments. From tender tamales drizzled in fiery pumpkin hot sauce to grilled mushrooms studded with crunchy spiced pecans, she shows that eating ethically can be seriously tasty\u2014even in the dead of winter.Start with some flavor makers:With this versatile artillery of mix-and-matchable, make-in-bulkable sauces and toppings, Vega turns February produce into meals that wow.Photograph By Jessica Pettway, Food Styling By Sue Li, Prop Styling By Sophie Strangio1. Pumpkin Hot Sauce: This spicy, velvety elixir works on everything from tamales to scrambled eggs. Mix in olive oil, vinegar, and honey to make vinaigrette, or simmer a cup with a can of coconut milk to start a curry-like sauce.2. Allium Confit: Garlic, leeks, and chives are all you need to make this savory infused oil, great on its own or as a base for just about any sauce or dressing\u2014including that pumpkin hot sauce to the above right!3. Guajillo Oil: Mild heat and smoky, fruity flavor. Dip tortillas in this bright red oil before pan- frying them for enchiladas, or add crushed peanuts, fried garlic, and extra chiles for salsa macha4. Pickled Beets: Quick-pickling is an excellent way to punch up and preserve mild root vegetables like beets. Add them to grain bowls for flavor and texture and use the leftover pickling liquid to dress saute\u0301ed vegetables for a colorful side dish.5. Sesame Cr\u00e8me: You can adapt this dairy-free recipe for just about any seed or nut you have. Use it on its own as a savory dressing or blend it with Dijon mustard for a vegan aioli that\u2019s good on fried potatoes, sandwiches, burgers, fish, you name it.6. Spiced Pecans: Pecans get an upgrade with garlic, honey, and fresh ground spices. Eat them by the fistful or sprinkle them liberally on salads or grilled veggies for deep flavor and crunch.Then build a meal:Carrot and Habanero TamalesA tamal filled with carrots, habaneros, and garlic is chef Maricela Vega\u2019s celebration of how the harvest from summer and fall floats into wintertime.View RecipeGrilled Mushrooms and Root VegetablesThis dish is perfect for long winter days when you want to flood the house with toasty, irresistible aromas.View RecipeWarm Sorghum Salad With Pickled BeetsThis salad uses ancient grains to create a dish that reflects Mexico and the American South.
