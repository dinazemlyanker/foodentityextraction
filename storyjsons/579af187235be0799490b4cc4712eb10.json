But I missed my opportunity with YaYa\u2019s.By Howard J Conyers, PhDJune 25, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Brett Carlsen/Getty ImagesFacebookTwitterEmailTwo days after Mardi Gras, just before COVID-19 shut down the whole country, I found myself in Louisville, Kentucky. As a scholar of the Black barbecue tradition birthed by our people\u2019s long farming history, I was there to attend an agricultural workshop and hopefully squeeze in a few good meals. But now, looking back, I am most struck by what I did not do, which was visit David McAtee\u2019s barbecue stand on a busy street corner in the city\u2019s West End.Due to the lack of coverage of Black pitmasters in mainstream food media, I had never heard about YaYa\u2019s BBQ. I had never read a review of David\u2019s ribs and hot links in a national newspaper or magazine. Never witnessed the positive work David was doing in the community\u2014how anybody who stopped by his corner, whether they had enough money or not, came away with a plate. I\u2019ve spent the past six years of my life seeking out unknown Black barbecue spots, trying to capture the oral histories and prevent yet another Black barbecue story from ending up in the cemetery. But I missed my opportunity with YaYa\u2019s that day, and less than two months later, David was gone. Shot dead by the same police he used to feed for free.It may seem simple, but in the midst of struggle, barbecue is a comfort. It is an act of passive resistance, of community-building, of fellowship. Even after it\u2019s served, people linger in that fellowship. And that\u2019s what David was doing, lingering after a curfew set to curb the protests of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor\u2019s deaths, when he was killed.Now, I can only imagine what we would\u2019ve talked about, David and I, if we\u2019d gotten the chance to meet and walk the neighborhood that day in Louisville. Two Black men descended from the enslaved, carrying on the rich barbecue tradition that our ancestors perfected. Maybe we would have discussed the struggles of being Black here in the United States. Maybe we would have talked about our shared history, our families, the South. About how barbecue can inspire a community. I never would have asked him to divulge his sauce recipe (never!), but I might have asked him about the base\u2014was it tomato? Vinegar? The answer to that question would have given me a big clue as to where he\u2019s from and who taught him the trade.To me, David McAtee\u2019s story represents all what barbecue culture is to being Black in America. Cooking barbecue was one of the first businesses that recently emancipated enslaved people could do to provide for themselves and their families. As they moved from rural areas to the cities, they carried with them techniques from the plantations and farms. They turned informal trade into permanent businesses, their barbecue shacks emerging where people lacked regular sources of food. In that vein, David was claiming the inheritance that his ancestors left for him: answering the call of barbecue as an endeavor of entrepreneurship.At 53 years old, he was still working hard to own his own space, to solidify his position as a pillar in the community, to put down roots on his own terms. He was on his way to making an honest living and securing his legacy\u2014a barbecue dream. But getting there isn\u2019t easy when you\u2019re Black. As my mother and father always told me, you have to work at least two to three times harder to get the same thing as your white counterparts.This I know from personal experience: Four years ago I asked my banker if I could open my own brick-and-mortar restaurant, and he told me no. Even though I had the credit score, the collateral, the cash in the bank, a full-time job with benefits at NASA, and some national visibility, it still wasn\u2019t enough. Not without an investor, the banker told me. And the investors, the ones with the capital, are almost always white. The racial wealth disparity in this country is real. Maybe David and I would have talked about this too.Or maybe we would have talked about Reverend Adam Scott, a preacher from Goldsboro, North Carolina, the heart of the world\u2019s largest tobacco market. By day he was a janitor and elevator operator; but starting in 1917, just after World War I, he also smoked meats in his backyard and sold them out of the back door of his home. He catered parties and receptions and fed people of both races. Business caught on and eventually Reverend Scott turned his back porch into a dining room. From there, he enlarged the restaurant three times. Scott claimed the recipe for his vinegar-pepper-based barbecue sauce came to him in a dream and laid the foundation for a multigenerational barbecue business; his family still sells Scott\u2019s Family Barbecue Sauce to this day.I wonder, what could David\u2019s family\u2019s legacy have been a hundred years from now, had his life not been cut short? Would he be alive to fulfill his barbecue dream in America if he was white instead of Black?What dreams would Ahmaud Arbery or George Floyd or Breonna Taylor or Rayshard Brooks have fulfilled? Or George Stinney, a 14-year-old Black boy from Alcolu, South Carolina, where I attended elementary school? Back in 1944, he was accused of murdering two white girls and executed after a 10-minute trial. In 2020, nearly a century later, the story remains the same: Those 8 minutes 46 seconds that a cop kneeled on George Floyd\u2019s throat were the only trial he got. And even if that cop ends up in prison, true justice will never be able to bring a dead man back to life.For David, it\u2019s no different. Investigations are still underway to determine whether he shot first or the cops did\u2014witnesses said the barbecue man was killed trying to save his niece after she was hit with pepper balls. But we the public will never know the entire story because a dead man can\u2019t talk. Because none of the cops who killed him had their body cameras on, even though accountability is why cops are mandated to wear cameras in the first place.There are burdens that a white person will never understand. The sad reality is that even if David and I had had the chance for this walk and talk, we would still be two Black men, still a threat to society regardless of what he would have owned or what credentials I\u2019ve earned. When you are Black, simply driving a pickup truck can be perceived as a danger\u2014I\u2019ve been pulled over twice for just that. Our skin color is a bull\u2019s-eye; we are destined to be guilty first and innocent last.During this time of unrest, I\u2019ve thought a lot about my own life: Will I have a worse chance of staying alive if I carry a handgun with the proper paperwork or if I have a registered American Kennel Club American Boxer by my side? To be honest, I feel I have a better chance of living with the dog\u2026because dogs are more respected in America than Black people.Someday I may return to Louisville. I might visit the whiskey distilleries or catch a horse race. But I will never be able to eat at YaYa\u2019s BBQ. I will never get to sit with David over mint juleps and ribs, talking history and entrepreneurship and what base makes the best sauce. Because no matter what we can do or know or own as Black people, we are still Black in America.Rest in power, David, and may God comfort your family.
