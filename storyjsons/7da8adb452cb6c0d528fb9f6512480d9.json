He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Of all the editors in the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen, Chris Morocco is the one you could imagine having aced his SATs. He approaches a recipe not so much as a meal in the making but as a vexing problem waiting to be solved.When tasked with giving readers a recipe for a \u201csimple\u201d roast chicken, he wrestled with how to achieve the crispiest skin, the juiciest white meat, done-enough dark meat and, because as if that weren\u2019t enough, he also challenged himself to figure out how to cook the potatoes in the same skillet as the chicken itself\u2014because why would you want all that salty, tasty chicken fat to go to waste?Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Having made his skillet-roasted chicken several times over (and did you know that the original article featuring it got nominated for a National Magazine Award?), I can vouch for the fact that it is mind-bogglingly good while still, somehow, being simple.Sometimes I like to give Chris a hard time for being a bit too analytical, for pacing about the test kitchen like Professor Morocco, apron cinched, Sharpie and digital thermometer at the ready.And sometimes Chris gets back at me, proving that he can do basic too. Like when he realized that while our Lasagna Bolognese recipe is truly epic and delicious, it\u2019s a smidge too epic. So he set out to make a more user-friendly BA\u2019s Best Lasagna\u2014not only creamy, rich and irresistible, but also eminently makable for the average home cook.Same goes for his Basic Bulgogi recipe, his at-home tribute to the Korean BBQ classic. Staying true to the original, he includes shredded pear in the marinade, but he also works to fast-track the entire process, including instructions to sear the the thinly sliced, marinated boneless short rib (or chicken breast, or pork loin) on your stovetop in case you\u2019re not in the mood to fire up your grill.who can resist the spicy katsu sandwich?\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesOther Morocco hits (of which there are many) include his Spicy Sweet Sambal Pork Noodles, his Gluten-Free Carrot Cake and, God bless him, his Spicy Chicken Katsu Sandwiches.The only thing Chris does as well as develop recipes is talk about them. He\u2019s a frequent, always-analytical guest on the Bon App\u00e9tit Foodcast, and you\u2019ll always spot him in the BA Test Kitchen on our YouTube channel, hosting his own videos or popping into his colleagues\u2019 with a well-timed assessment of their latest recipes.Oh, and in case you were wondering what he did with his spiffy SAT scores, he attended Oberlin College. No word on whether he held down a kitchen shift at the co-op.Get the recipes:Cast-Iron Roast Chicken with Crispy PotatoesLasagna BologneseBA\u2019s Best LasagnaBasic BulgogiSpicy Sweet Sambal Pork NoodlesMolten Caramel CakesSpicy Chicken Katsu SandwichesExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterRead MorecultureBon Appe\u0301tit Used to Just Be a Magazine.
