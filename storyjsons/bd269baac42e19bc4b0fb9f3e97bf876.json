The nutritional yeast acts like a vegan version of parm, adding a hit of umami flavor that plays well with bitter kale and earthy buckwheat noodles. We suggest using curly kale, which roasts into light, crispy chips, instead of Tuscan.Ingredients4 servings1medium bunch curly kale, ribs and stems removed, leaves coarsely chopped (about 4 cups)1\u00bccups unsweetened coconut flakes\u2153cup nutritional yeast\u00bdtsp. kosher salt, plus more2Tbsp. plus \u00bd cup extra-virgin olive oil8oz. dried soba noodles3Tbsp. tahini2Tbsp. plus 2 tsp. soy sauce1Tbsp. honey2tsp. toasted sesame oil, plus more for drizzling\u00bdtsp. crushed red pepper flakes, plus more for serving1limePreparationStep 1Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat to 375\u00b0. Toss kale, coconut, nutritional yeast, \u00bd tsp. salt, and 2 Tbsp. olive oil in a large bowl to coat.

Drizzle with additional sesame oil and sprinkle with more red pepper flakes.How would you rate Soba Noodles With Crispy Kale?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (36)Back to TopTrianglei make this almost once a week- it's one of my favorite dinners. i use shredded coconut instead of flakes, only 1/4 cup oil for the sauce, and generously sprinkle the finished plate with gochugaru flakes. once full, i dunk my colander in ice water, gently separating the noodles, and that keeps them from getting slimy. crispy curly kale is heaven but dino works in a pinch.moonbeamsanta cruz, ca1/9/2022This was a winner. Followed the recipe. Shortened the time in the oven to 10 minutes, but everybody loved it. AdelbertChicago IL9/19/2021After making this the first time, I immediately ordered more soba noodles and tahini, to be sure I can make this wherever the craving hits. It's unlike anything else I've ever tasted, and I just love it. That said, I do make the dressing with only 1/4 c oil, which is plenty for me. HalleSeattle4/12/2021All the people talking about slimy noodles - why are almost all soba noodle instructions on the package so wrong? You should never cook soba noodles for more than three minutes, some say that you should boil the water and turn it off before putting the noodles in the pot. Then they should be at the very least rinsed in cold water, or better yet - drain and submerge in ice water for a minute. You will never have slimy noodles again! Otherwise, delicious recipe - definitely will enter my regular rotation. Lisa GAlexandria, VA3/3/2021I get that some people find this combination odd - the noodles are slightly slimy with really crispy and sort of cheesy tasting kale and coconut -  but I really like it. So long as I remember to keep stocked up on coconut flakes all the ingredients are things I normally have around so its an easy addition to the repertoire. My experiments to substitute the type of noodles have been unsuccessful though - far too slimy with rice noodles. AnonymousLondon, UK1/4/2021Yum! This soba noodle salad was an excellent lunch and seems as though it will keep for at least a couple of days as leftovers. I omitted coconut flakes, purely based on the fact that I didn't have any on hand, but threw in some crispy onions to keep a good crunch. Very creative way to enjoy soba noodles and get your greens in.KristyWashington, DC11/16/2020This SUPER tasty! Highly recommended, and of course is great with crispy tofu. I've made it with and without the coconut depending on whether or not I have some handy, and I definitely recommend with\u2014if you don't have coconut, consider subbing it for something else crunchy. The texture is fantastic! Definitely putting this in my regular meal rotation.\n\nOne thing I will say is that the noodle sauce can turn out really oily. I made it once and felt it was perfect, but the second time it was especially greasy and I had a hard time keeping the sauce from splitting (I would have to re-whisk it a bunch to get it to recombine). Not sure what the deal with that was, but in the future I would maybe even halve the olive oil, or even just add a little at a time to get it the right volume and consistency.wizardlingBerkeley, CA10/8/2020This recipe was SO good! I didn't have coconut flakes, but used about 3/4 cups of unsweetened shredded coconut. I toasted the shredded coconut separately, as I was worried about it burning.  I also reduced the oil in the dressing from 1/2 cup to 6 tablespoons (2 tbsp shy of 1/2 cup). Next time I'll add some crispy baked tofu as well.  I loved the brightness the lime adds to the dressing. I'll definitely be making this again!AnonymousOntario, Canada8/9/2020Amazing. One of the best things I've ever made and a something different to add to the dinner rotation. Highly recommend!!! AnonymousLos Angeles7/29/2020The sauce was too oily for me and the kale + soba was an odd combo. Overall, not into it. Anonymous7/18/2020AMAZING ! !!!! I learned a soba noodle recipe just like this in my middle school cooking class years ago and haven't found a better one since. Had basically all the same ingredients plus rice vineager in the sauce and ginger. Highly recommendAnonymousBerkeley, Ca5/27/2020Great for a packed lunch or midweek mealAnonymousMiami, FL5/24/2020I love this recipe, my boyfriend loves this recipe and asks for it all the time. I\u2019m planning on making the kale tonight as a side for our veggie burgers. My main problem is I have a hard time getting my coconut to turn out right. It usually gets a little too done, but I don\u2019t really mind it. AnonymousPortland, OR5/21/2020We eat an oil-free plant based diet and this recipe was recommended by friends who don't.\n\nI substituted aquafaba (the liquid form canned chickpeas) as follows: \n\nTossed the kale with 3 Tbsp aquafaba to coat.  Mixed the coconut, salt and nutritional yeast together than added to the coated kale and tossed to incorporate.\n\nUsed aquafaba in place of both sesame oil and olive oil in the sauce and added in 1 Tbsp toasted sesame seeds.\n\nThis was OUTSTANDING!!  Will definitely be making this again.loves2cookfor6Chicago5/11/2020I love this recipe. I love the nuttiness and creaminess of the sauce and the texture of the noodles. Very good.
