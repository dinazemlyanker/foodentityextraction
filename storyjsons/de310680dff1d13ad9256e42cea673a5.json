You\u2019re going out for extra-special avocado toast\u2013\u2013and so much more. Now Dallas-area avocado lovers can experience their favorite fruit like never before at AvoEatery, the world\u2019s first polished-casual restaurant dedicated solely to capitalizing on the fresh, versatile, creamy, and delicious aspects of avocados. Everything, from the d\u00e9cor to the 29 menu items (plus 10 avocado-based cocktails!) pay homage to the fruit. Light fixtures resembling avocado harvesters, with a bright color palette and avocado wall art are just a few of the aspects that contribute to this playful, upscale design.Dine at the first-ever polished casual avocado restaurant in the world.\nSo what did it take for someone to finally develop a restaurant dedicated to avocados?! It all started with Avocados From Mexico. This not-for-profit organization based in Texas is responsible for marketing this imported fruit from Mexico (which, by the way, makes up 84% of the US avocado market). The Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex is the fourth largest metropolitan area in the U.S. and was named the 2019 Restaurant City of the Year. When it came to revolutionizing the way we eat avocados, it only seemed right that Avocados From Mexico would team up with Dallas-based Trinity Groves, a restaurant concept incubator program. The program encourages chefs and restaurateurs to create and present extraordinary dining concepts to a team of experienced restaurateurs who then turn their dream into a reality. The result? Innovative ideas, like AvoEatery, from some of the most creative minds in the industry\u2013\u2013and a wholly unique menu to prove it.Seven days a week, at lunch and dinner, you\u2019ll find an avocado twist on familiar dishes you might expect and some you definitely wouldn\u2019t expect.

Those who prefer their avocado over a fresh bed of greens can opt for something hearty like a grilled steak salad, which is no average salad\u2013\u2013pickled carrots, crushed pistachios, and crispy vermicelli see to that. There are lighter options, too, like the grilled avocado bowl, which piles on nutrient-dense goodness like quinoa, roasted zucchini, baby spinach, and avocado citrus dressing.For the sandwich-lover, AvoEatery has you covered with the hits, like their hot chicken sandwich featuring pickled avocados, and an avocado ranch, and their B.L.A.T.\u2014for an avocado twist on the classic B.L.T.
