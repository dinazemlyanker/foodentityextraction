It\u2019s the star of the dish, so it\u2019s gotta be good! This recipe comes from Khan\u2019s book, Ripe Figs: Recipes and Stories from Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus, and it\u2019s guaranteed to soothe.

I'm sure it's fabulous.  I just want to point out to the people at BA who are doing your categories that this recipe is far from keto, which is one of the tags that you have given it.  The rice and even the cornstarch put it out of reach for anyone following a keto diet.  Jennifer11/14/2021I saw this recipe in the magazine and was so intrigued, I had to try it! I didn\u2019t have Aleppo style pepper so I had to substitute with regular pepper, and some sprinkles of cayenne and chili powder for color and spice. I really like the way it turned out! It\u2019s very warming and soothing, but also doesn\u2019t feel supper heavy either. It came together really quickly as well, so I would definitely make this again.
