Like, last year I sent her a Burlap & Barrel spice set. She loved the Vietnamese cinnamon, and I loved that when I baked banana bread the next time I was home, I didn\u2019t have to use spices that expired in the 80s. I know I am not alone here! We love our moms, ummas, and ammis, and many of us learned how to cook at their apron strings\u2014but there are things about their kitchens that drive us nuts. Mother\u2019s Day is the perfect excuse to give them the gift of a kitchen tool upgrade and give yourself the gift of not slicing your finger with a knife that hasn\u2019t been sharpened in a decade. Just make sure to throw in some flowers or nice chocolates too. Here are our editors' picks for the best Mother's Day gifts for 2021.My mother is the true queen of tchotchkes and her kitchen is no exception. Her measuring spoons are a porcelain set with decorative swirls that she absolutely got in the Home Goods clearance aisle (we love a good sale). So cute! So impractical! Which is a shame because aside from being a tchotchke-hoarder, my mom also loves to bake, and any great baker needs a set of functional measuring spoons. This Oxo Good Grips set is what I have at home, and I would love to give my mom a set too. They're magnetic so they stay nested together in their drawer, but they pull apart super easily when you\u2019re ready to use them. Save the trinkets for the living room, Mom! \u2013Emily Schultz, social media managerOxo Stainless Steel Measuring Spoons$11 at Amazon$10 at Bed Bath & BeyondWhenever I want to grate some fresh Parm or zest a lemon at my mom\u2019s house, I am confronted by my old nemesis: a novelty mini-grater about the size of a doll\u2019s hairbrush. Whom is this grater for? Elves? Culinarily inclined babies? Perhaps it\u2019s the perfect size to throw in your purse for Parmesan emergencies, but it is a terrible size for anything else. For Mother\u2019s Day, Mom is getting a Microplane whether she wants one or not. \u2013MacKenzie Chung Fegan, senior commerce editorMicroplane Grater$16 at Amazon$15 at Bed Bath & BeyondMy mom is the kind of environmentally fastidious gal who washes out plastic baggies, composts like a champ, and saves leftover salmon skin for our omega-loving doggos. Her crunchy granola vibes are family lore, which is why her coffee strategy completely baffles me: my mom owns an off-brand Nespresso machine that uses coffee pods. (Yup, I\u2019m talking about those infamous little turtle-choking-single-use plastic cups.) I know she\u2019s only stuck with The Machine because a) she\u2019s fussy about her flat whites and b) technology is foe. I\u2019m confident this adorable Smeg espresso machine will convert her. There aren\u2019t too many bleeps or buttons, and it pulls a nice shot AND froths milk all at the same time. Did I mention it\u2019s also earth\u2019s prettiest coffee maker? \u2013Ali Francis, associate editorSmeg Espresso Machine$490 at Nordstrom$490 at William SonomaWhile I look exactly like my mom, every time I see her use a plastic fork as a whisk I question how we could possibly be related. This Mother\u2019s Day, I\u2019d love to treat her to a real wire whisk that won\u2019t snap under the weight of a thick batter. We may not agree on everything, but I hope she'll see I'm right about this one. \u2013Chala Tyson Tshitundu, assistant editorFrench Wire Whisk$18 at Amazon$15 at Kuhn RikonLike most South Asian cooks, my mom doesn\u2019t own measuring cups. She\u2019s a terrific cook, throwing in a little bit of this and a little bit of that, letting her instinct guide her. The only problem is that because nothing is standardized, it\u2019s hard for me to replicate her recipes at home! For Mother\u2019s Day, I\u2019d like to get her a set of good measuring cups so she can write down her recipes and pass them on to future generations. \u2013Rachel Gurjar, associate food editorOxo Stainless Steel Measuring Cups$21 at Amazon$20 at Bed Bath & BeyondMy mom's black corduroy jacket from the '80s is cool. Her citrus juicer from the same era is not. The behemoth two-piece, cup-and-reamer situation always comes apart in the drawer, and once you've got it together, it produces juice that's speckled with seeds\u2014not cute! So this year I'm upgrading her to a one-piece squeezer, which requires way less effort for a way less seedy result. Even the driest limes and most over-sized lemons are no match for this squeezer's double-lever technology\u2014and its caution-tape yellow color makes it easy for my mom\u2019s Boomer eyes to spot. \u2013Amanda Shapiro, digital editorial directorCitrus Juicer$25 $13 at Amazon$25 at Bed Bath & BeyondI love to cook for my mom whenever I visit, but every time I go to make garlic fried rice, I forget that she doesn\u2019t have a rice cooker. To her credit, there are plenty of other ways to make perfect rice (I usually default to oven rice when I\u2019m back home), and she\u2019s never been one to collect fancy appliances\u2014the more buttons and settings, the less likely she is to use it. But in my eyes, the best Mother's Day gifts are a little luxurious and a little selfish. I\u2019d get her this cute single-buttoned Zojirushi rice cooker so she\u2014and more importantly, I\u2014will always be just a flick of a switch away from the perfect rice. \u2013Nico Avalle, digital production assistantZojirushi Rice Cooker$55 $45 at Nordstrom Rack$53 $48 at AmazonMy in-laws live in Provo, Utah. Elevation: 4,551 feet. I love to cook for them when I visit, but whenever I use their oven, it never goes quite right. It\u2019s mildly mortifying to be known as \u201cthe daughter-in-law who works at a food magazine but never knows when her cakes will be done,\u201d so I\u2019m trying to figure out how to adapt my bakes and braises for high altitude. Next time I\u2019m in Utah, I\u2019ll bring a Thermoworks DOT oven thermometer so I can eliminate one variable and adjust the oven temperature with accuracy. \u2013MacKenzie Chung Fegan, senior commerce editorThermoworks Oven Thermometer$45 at ThermoWorksMy parents have a collection of extremely old, yellowed, non-heatproof rubber spatulas. They melt at the very sight of an open flame, and they're so ancient that the rubber has started pilling. Like a sweater. Did you even know that was possible?? The Mother\u2019s Day gift my mom doesn\u2019t know she needs is a Get It Right spatula. It\u2019s made of heat-resistant silicone and is smooth like a dolphin\u2014no pilling in sight. \u2013Christina Chaey, senior food editorGet It Right Spatula$13 at BA MarketExplore Bon App\u00e9titGift GuidesShoppingToolsGiftsRead Moreculture67 Mother\u2019s Day Brunch Recipes for an Easy GiftGallery67 SlidesBy Mehreen Karimrecipes33 Mother\u2019s Day Dinner Recipes to Cook for the Moms in Your LifeGallery33 SlidesBy Nico AvalleLifestyle6 Cute Gardening Gifts, Because Mom Doesn\u2019t Need Any More CandlesGallery6 SlidesBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
