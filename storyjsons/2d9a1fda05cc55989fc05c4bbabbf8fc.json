You need something you can make in advance that will withstand the long journey and impress the friends who only thought to bring Swedish Fish and a bag of popcorn. Here's the solution: This sandwich, which looks like it came from the Italian deli of your dreams and which you'll definitely want to eat whilst in a beach chair, watching the waves hit the sand (or the dogs scamper in the park etc.). While we love the trifecta of mortadella, soppressata, and cooked ham, feel free to get creative with the meats you choose. Just remember to get a mix of cured and cooked for an array of flavors and textures.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Cut 1 head of iceberg lettuce in half through the core. Peel off flimsy outer layers. Reserve one half for another use (perhaps this Iceberg Salad with Italian Dressing?). Cut remaining half in half again through the core (so you have two quarters), then thinly slice crosswise to create shreds. Peel  \u00bd small red onion and cut in half through the root. Thinly slice each wedge lengthwise so that you make wispy arcs. Cut 1\u00bd cups pickled peppadew peppers in half.Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 2Drain and finely chop 1 cup jarred mixed giardiniera. Aim for the veg to be the size of peas\u2014you don't want huge pieces that will get in the way of your sandwich experience. Transfer to a small bowl. Stir in \u2154 cup mayonnaise; taste and season with salt.Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 3Slightly overlap 2 sheets of parchment paper to create 1 larger sheet. Cut 16x4\" loaf sesame bread in half lengthwise with a serrated knife and place on parchment. You will build the sandwich on parchment for easy wrapping and cutting.Step 4Spread giardiniera mayonnaise on cut sides of bread with a large spoon.Step 5Layer \u2153 lb. thinly sliced cooked ham, \u2153 lb. thinly sliced mortadella, \u2153 lb. thinly sliced soppressata, and \u2153 lb. sliced provolone on bottom half of bread, folding or draping as necessary to keep it tidy and within confines of bread.Step 6Spread onion and peppadew peppers over meats and cheese.Step 7Top with shredded lettuce. It will seem like a lot and you may not think it's possible to pack it all on\u2014but have a little faith and don't hold back. Once you close up the sandwich, the lettuce will compact down quite a bit and you'll be grateful you piled on more than you thought was necessary.Step 8Drizzle \u00bc cup pickled pepper brine over lettuce. (Acidic, spicy, and slightly sweet, pickle brine is one of our favorite stand-ins for vinegar or lemon juice.) Season lettuce generously with salt and pepper. Gather up overhang of parchment paper and securely wrap. Cut in half with your serrated knife. Make a sawing motion (rather than a pressing one) so that you're not squishing your sandwich.Step 9Wrap entire hoagie tightly in plastic wrap, then cut crosswise into 4 even sections. (The plastic wrap acts sort of like a girdle, holding in all of the meat, cheese, and veg so that they won't fly out when you slice smaller segments. It also acts as an insurance against leaking.) If you're taking your sandwich out into the world, wrap again in plastic or slip back into bread bag for easy transporting.How would you rate Big Ass Beach Hoagie?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (7)Back to TopTriangleI\u2019m sure this is very tasty, but it is NOT a Hoagie.\n\nA Hoagie never and oh, I do mean NEVER has mayonnaise on an Italian.\n\nNevah.Philly BoyPhilly 3/17/2022Great flavors. It was just a touch hard to keep in one piece but the messiness makes for a great sandwichcbruett7/19/2020Mayo on a hoagie is not a hoagie. Olive oil and oregano. Anonymous6/3/2020Love it. I've made it to take on my last two camping trips, and will make it in the future. It's rich yet not heavy, it hits all the sweet/sour/buttery notes that you could want in a sandwich, and you can pretty much riff on it however you want to... It's really just a big-ass hoagie.AnonymousCully, Portland, OR5/23/2020This was so good! Paul0358Oklahoma9/20/2019Looks like a reduced version of Muffuletta.\nthechewinn_novaNoVA (Northern Virginia)7/16/2019THIS. WAS. DELICIOUS. Saw it on my Instagram in the morning, was eating it at a friend\u2019s (not-beach) apartment eight hours later. Peppadews were a hit - not to be missed. My supermarket didn\u2019t have giardineria (not that I could pronounce it anyway) so I subbed with Grillo\u2019s Italian dills. Forgot the mortadella and still lived.
