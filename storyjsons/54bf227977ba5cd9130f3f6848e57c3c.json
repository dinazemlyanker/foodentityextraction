Slicing the leeks with the grain prevents them from falling apart into mush after getting caramelized.

The leeks are absolutely delicious.\n\nIMO, the fava beans, the garlic on the bread, and the chives are all optional. And the rest of the ingredients don't have to be fresh. Just carmelized leeks with the rosemary (dried is ok), Aleppo style pepper (this is one ingredient I haven't tried substituting), lemon zest (dried is ok), and lemon juice (bottled is ok) on any kind of toast is great.\n\nI've also mixed the leeks with pesto or zhoug and tossed with pasta to make a really savory pasta salad.\n\nOne of the easiest and most versatile dishes I've found recently!Kal5/10/2021Taste-wise, this recipe is incredible. You can substitute gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes) for the Aleppo pepper if you can't find any.\n\nMy main critique is that I would not recommend covering the leeks, especially if adding some salt. They put out enough water that they won't caramelize for way longer than 10 minutes. Also, you'll want to make sure you don't crowd the pan, which four decent-sized leeks in one medium pan absolutely will. I had to split my leeks into batches. So just prepare for this to take longer than the recipe says.CharlesHamilton, Ontario2/18/2021Incredibly tasty. I used a frozen bag of peas instead of fava. It was messy to eat so I would mash the peas slightly. Tasty eaten by itself as leftovers too. Overall, this was received really well at our family dinner. Anonymous12/27/2020The fava beans are to be eaten raw?Eflat6southern California5/29/2020Delicious spring recipe, but be aware that there's a hidden additional amount of time needed for ingredient prep. Fresh fava beans need to be shelled, blanched, and peeled, and leeks need to be carefully washed for dirt.AnonymousCalifornia5/3/2020I just tried to recipe for the caramelized leek part. I added it on a pizza, with ricotta and pancetta... and boy was it good! This will become a new staple!AnonymousMontreal11/21/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titToastLeekVegetableFava BeanBeanQuickEasyWeeknight MealsNut-FreeDairy-FreeVeganVegetarianHealthyishSaut\u00e9LunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
