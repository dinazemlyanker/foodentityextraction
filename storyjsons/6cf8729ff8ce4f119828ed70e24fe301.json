We all know that. I don\u2019t need to dive into the handwritten, three-hour lecture on the merits of butter that I keep in my pocket at all times. It\u2019s one of those ingredients (or foods, depending on your lifestyle) that is and always will be perfect. Essential. Simple. Beautiful. Salted. Unsalted. But lilies were made to be gilded, which is why hot honey butter exists. We\u2019re looking at the trifecta of flavor: Sweetness. Fat. Heat. This combination (with the addition of some salt) is the reason a spicy salami pizza drizzled with honey is so damn good. Or why a platter of honey barbecue wings get devoured instantly.It\u2019s everything your taste buds crave, and it plays a very important role in our 2018 Super Bowl menu of classic beef chili with skillet cornbread. Traditional Southern cornbread isn't sweet and muffiny. There's no sugar added, and there's no flour, only course-ground cornmeal. It's sturdy and dry, so when this hot honey butter is slathered all over it (before being dunked in chili, the flavor wheel is complete.The best thing about this little miracle (I sound like the cooing parent of a newborn) is that it only takes four ingredients and 132 seconds (a rough approximation) to make. Take 1 stick of room-temperature butter, and chop it into smaller pieces. Throw those in a bowl, and add 3 Tbsp. honey, 1 Tbsp. hot sauce and a generous pinch of kosher salt. Then, you whisk the hell out of it, until it becomes on smooth, creamy piece of art. Blammo. Done.You can personalize this condiment too. While we like Frank\u2019s as an all-purpose hot sauce, you can substitute whatever sauce strikes your fancy. Just make sure that you use a hot sauce focusing on flavor, not heat. We don\u2019t want our butter to burn holes in whatever we choose to put it on.Eyes on that chili? Get the full Super Bowl menu here.\nPhoto by Bobbi LinAnd that\u2019s the final question. What do we put it on? How about that cornbread you\u2019re going to eat with your chili? Or some fresh biscuits? Maybe a slice of hearty sourdough from your local bakery? Hell, you could even melt it and use it to coat some wings, before blasting them under the broiler. It\u2019s up to you. The ball is in your court, or...uh\u2026the butter is on your knife? You get it.
