We\u2019re sad to see it go, but maybe that will give Rae time to host her fantasy dinner party, with platters of food, plenty of drinks, and a collection of legendary musicians.Which three people would you invite to your dream dinner party?I\u2019m obsessed with musical artistry, so I would choose Frank Ocean, Solange, and Prince. I feel they would have a good time together. The only insecurity I have is what I would bring to the table.I\u2019m sure you\u2019d bring a lot! Are you hoping they\u2019d introduce you to new musicians?More than that. I get a lot of creative ideas from music. Listening to a song can inspire a whole concept for a television show or movie.What do you cook?I went back and forth. Do I offer sushi, omakase, or Senegalese food? With Senegalese culture, we have such a great way of eating, with big platters built for communion, discussion, and debates. If I can\u2019t bring anything musically, then the hosting has to be on point.What kind of Senegalese food would you serve?We have great appetizers. I love pastels. They\u2019re like empanadas or Jamaican patties, dumplings stuffed with fish or beef. They\u2019re delicious: fried or baked, with a spicy tomato-onion sauce for dipping. My mom used to make them on Culture Day at school.And the main course?Maf\u00e9, which can be made with beef or lamb and has a peanut sauce. It\u2019s delicious. I love peanut butter with everything. And another favorite dish, soupou kandja, is a blend between my two cultures. My mother, who is from Louisiana, makes gumbo. Soupou kandja is kind of a Senegalese gumbo.\u00a0Where are you serving this food?Maybe at a place like Africa Kine in New York, or we could go to Senegal and do it beachside. I\u2019d do a version of what they do at a place in Senegal called Les Almadies, which is by the beach, has a sea breeze, and a cabana-esque setting with modest tablecloths and big silver and gold platters of food. We\u2019ll eat with our hands; we\u2019ll eat traditionally; and of course we\u2019ll have libations.Libations of what sort?Bissap, which is a sweetened hibiscus drink, with gin mixed in, garnished with mint. You can swap in your drink of choice. I mostly drink vodka, so\u2026Vodssap? I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ll work on a name.\u00a0What do you talk about?\u00a0I would ask which song of the other guests\u2019 they wish they had made.\u00a0What song of theirs do you wish you had made?Prince\u2019s \u201cThe Beautiful Ones,\u201d Solange\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Touch My Hair,\u201d and Frank Ocean\u2019s \u201cPyramids.\u201d\u00a0It\u2019s the last season of the pioneering show Insecure. Which character from the show gets invited to your party?Molly. Without a doubt. Because Molly can just turn it on. And she can complement my awkwardness just like she does for Issa on the show. Not that I\u2019m mad awkward\u2026.Explore Bon App\u00e9titDream Dinner PartyPop CultureInterviewsRead MorecultureJos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s Would Serve Oysters, Gazpacho, and Fried Eggs at His Dream Dinner PartyBy Dawn DaviscultureMindy Kaling Would Only Have One Guest at Her Dream Dinner PartyBy Dawn DaviscultureCicely Tyson on the Star-Studded, Very Purple Dinner Party of Her DreamsBy Dawn DavisRecipes you want to make.
