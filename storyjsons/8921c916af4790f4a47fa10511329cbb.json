Was I hungry? Not at all. Was I, perhaps, not in the best mood because just hours ago I had taken a 5 a.m. flight from New York City to Los Angeles? Ask my husband and my mom. These delicate situations\u2014combined with me forcing them, just as stuffed and lethargic as I am, to eat a second lunch, hobbit style\u2014seemed perfectly primed for a game of passive-aggressive complaining. (This is what conflict looks like for my family!) And that might have very well happened, if the tacos at El Ruso weren\u2019t so incredible.It starts with the tortilla, a diaphanous round of vegetable shortening, water, salt, and Mexican flour. Julia Silva, El Ruso\u2019s tortilla maestra, drives down to Mexicali for this specific flour, which she thinks is softer than the American variety, and flattens each tortilla by hand, the same way she\u2019s always done for 40 years. The result is the perfect pliable, fat-laced vessel for chef Walter Soto\u2019s fillings.Finessed over 17 years of making tacos\u2014both professionally in his native Sinaloa and for fun at family gatherings once he moved to L.A.\u2014Soto\u2019s tacos hit all the right notes. He serves them costra style, throwing Monterrey cheese underneath Silva\u2019s already perfect tortillas, and then griddles it, so the cheese fuses to the tortilla and becomes simultaneously scorched, crunchy, and melty. The ideal texture! The carne asada is simply seasoned (just sea salt) and expertly grilled to an actually juicy medium. On top, Soto spoons a ladleful of red beans, plump and velvety after simmering for hours with a little bit of chile and sea salt.The second I started spooning from the truck\u2019s choose-your-condiment adventure\u2014salsa roja, guacamole, cilantro-laced raw onions, pickled onions, and a few lime wedges\u2014it didn\u2019t matter how grumpy, full, and sleep-deprived I\u2019d felt just minutes earlier. And the moment the tacos hit our plastic table, it was clear my mom and husband had forgotten, too. We ate in blissful silence, soaking up the L.A. sun and some dribbling meat juices. Second lunch at El Ruso truly does wonders.Go there: El RusoExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsLos AngelesRead MorerestaurantsI\u2019m From Texas and This Is the Best Quesadilla I\u2019ve Ever HadBy Priya KrishnaRecipes you want to make.
