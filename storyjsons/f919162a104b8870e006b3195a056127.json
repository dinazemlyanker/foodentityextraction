Let sit for 1 hour at room temperature or chill, uncovered, for up to 12 hours (longer is better; overnight works great).Step 2Preheat oven to 400\u00b0. Roast chile on a rimmed baking sheet until puffy and it smells toasty, about 2 minutes. Remove seeds and place chile in a blender along with 1 cup hot water.Step 3Heat broiler. Scatter onion and garlic on same rimmed baking sheet. Broil, undisturbed, until blackened on top (don\u2019t worry if they get super dark), 12\u201314 minutes. Pop garlic out of skins and place garlic and onion in blender with chile. Pur\u00e9e until smooth but still speckled with chile; set aside.Step 4Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high. Working in batches, cook lamb, turning occasionally until brown on all sides, 12\u201314 minutes total. Using a slotted spoon, transfer lamb to a plate. Carefully pour off oil and return lamb to pot. Add bay leaves, allspice, coriander, cumin, and oregano and cook, stirring to coat lamb, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in 6 cups water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a bare simmer; mostly cover with lid (you want a little space for steam to escape) and cook, stirring occasionally, until lamb is tender, 60\u201375 minutes.Step 5Add squash to stew and cook until almost tender, 6\u20138 minutes. Stir in onion-chile pur\u00e9e, season with salt, and cook 10 minutes to let flavors meld. Taste and season with more salt if needed.Step 6Ladle stew into bowls and top with feta and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges.Step 7Do Ahead: Stew (without feta and cilantro) can be made 3 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill. Add feta and cilantro just before serving.How would you rate Lamb and Winter Squash Soup ?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (6)Back to TopTriangleA question for anyone who knows, what is the purpose of salting the lamb over night for this recipe?  I understand dry brine and have used that technique for roasting or grilling meats but never for a stew or soup. AnonymousAlberton, MT1/4/2020Such an unexpected, delicious soup. I used butternut! The chile broth is brilliant, I'd never made a soup with this technique before. And yes, the final texture is this spiced broth, not a thick stew (re: disappointed review), but that's what it's supposed to be. If you're looking for a thick, hearty soup, try one of the slow-cooked stews from Oct 2018 issue! alexbeggsBA.com 1/20/2019I found this recipe a bit disappointing. Despite reducing it at the end, it has no body and thus is more soup than stew. Also, the  flavor of the paste wasn't really discernible, nor were the spices. All in all, not a stand-out.AnonymousLondon Ontario Canada 10/31/2018I've made this. Twice. \nIts really (really) good.hphelpsliptCatskills, NY10/8/2018This looks delicious! Can you substitute the water with chicken broth? Also, should the onion be white or yellow? I would love to make it this weekend. AnonymousSan Francisco1/17/2018Can you substitute the water with chicken broth?  Also, what type of onion...yellow or white? I'll be making it this weekend!
