Now, she spends her days going car to car at get-out-the-vote events, making sure people are registered to cast their ballot. This November she\u2019ll be working for the county as a paid volunteer, handing out ballots, and showing people to voting booths.After seven years working in the service industry, Rao was furloughed from her job when Afterword shuttered due to the pandemic in March. Before the pandemic, she paid attention to the news but hadn\u2019t gotten deeply involved in politics. \u201cI just had my beliefs and voted,\u201d she says. But during her time off, she started paying more attention and found the League of Women Voters, the 100-year-old national civic organization that mobilizes female voters.\u201cThis election is super poignant for the service industry,\u201d she says. \u201c[We] are not unemployed through decisions we have made. We are unemployed [because of] other decision-makers\u201d\u2014politicians who have legislated Americans\u2019 access to health care or how much restaurants will receive in stimulus funding.She says her experience as a restaurant worker both energized and prepared her\u00a0to get the vote out. She knows how to keep calm when confronted with angry voters or de-escalate tense phone conversations.\u201cWhen I get people signed up to vote and give them the steps and they are like, \u2018I know how to do this,\u2019 it is hitting the same part of my brain that enjoys providing service.\u201dIn March, as the pandemic suddenly halted in-person dining, millions of workers were out of a job, at the mercy of GoFundMe donations and gift card purchases for income. As the country has slowly reopened, some have gone back to work\u2014but many of those who still haven\u2019t are using the time off to mobilize politically. They\u2019re writing letters to voters, text banking, phone banking, and signing up to be poll workers. They, like Rao, are emboldened to make change within their industry and to get involved in the election more broadly\u2014and the organizational and people skills they developed working in restaurants are coming in handy.When Lorraine Nguyen found out that she and her fellow employees at the Cherry Circle Room in Chicago were furloughed until next spring, with no support from ownership and little to no guidance from state and federal governments,\u00a0she helped to put together fundraisers to pay her colleagues\u2019 groceries, rent, and medical expenses. She realized she had a talent for organizing and signed up to be an election judge at her local polling place.While working at a restaurant, she says, \u201cit is hard to see outside that bubble.\u201d But now, removed from her job, her perspective is different. \u201cThere are gigantic systemic structures that led to the decisions made for this industry. We have to know about them if we want to fight for better conditions.\u201d\u201cA restaurant is a microcosm of American problems, from racism to sexual harassment,\u201d adds Anna Dunn, who previously worked at Diner in Brooklyn and has signed up to be a poll worker. Throughout her career in the service industry, Dunn has always been interested in advocacy. \u201cFor most of the people I know who are politically motivated,\u201d Dunn says, \u201cit does come from working in a restaurant, or [any] structure that has these different layers of inequality.\u201dThe skills acquired from cooking on the line, being behind a bar, or running a host stand are also uniquely translatable to election work.Marjorie Nu\u00f1ez, formerly a waitress at Brooklyn\u2019s Oxalis who is now phone and text banking for her home state of Florida, says she is \u201cnot scared of people being rude to me\u201d and \u201cdefinitely not turned off by talking to strangers.\u201dAs a server, \u201cone of the main objectives is to sell the food and the drinks and the experience,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you are...talking about the importance of voting, it is kind of like selling.\u201dAs a former bar manager at \u00c0 C\u00f4t\u00e9 in San Francisco, Wendy Hector says that not only has her restaurant experience made her open to talking to people from all walks of life, but it has also helped her relate to voters, many of whom she says have also worked service industry jobs or have kids or friends recently laid off from the business.\u201cIt definitely bridges the gap,\u201d she says, \u201cwhen they realize one, you are a real person, and two, you had a real job, and that you are not just some liberal elite calling from an ivory tower.\u201dSome workers have gone even further, creating or joining organizations to support each other\u2019s efforts. Staff the Polls, started by Matt Weyandt of Xocolatl Small Batch Chocolate, is a resource for Atlanta restaurant employees to sign up to be poll workers\u2014it also calls on restaurant owners to give their staff time off on Election Day and during poll worker training. Another initiative, Drag Out the Vote, is mobilizing drag queens and kings, many of whom are out of a job due to the pause on drag brunch and other drag shows that often take place at bars and restaurants. Kylie Minono, who used to perform as Adele at Hamburger Mary\u2019s in San Francisco\u2019s Castro neighborhood, now stations herself in different areas of the city with other \u201cdrag ambassadors\u201d as they are called\u2014all dressed in their finest outfits\u2014asking people if they are registered to vote. She says that young voters in particular are often more interested in approaching a drag queen than an official-looking volunteer on the sidewalk.\u201cOne of the reasons I love drag shows, and especially drag brunches, is that it is an opportunity to exchange energy with people,\u201d she says. \u201cBeing out and registering people to vote and being able to engage with the community in that way has helped me to start to feel whole again.\u201dWith no clarity around when restaurants may return in full force, some of these workers have made their shift into politics permanent.After the owners of Philadelphia\u2019s Vernick Food & Drink announced that the restaurant would be shutting down temporarily in March, Lauren Guild, who ran the door and host stand there, thought about how much she enjoyed canvassing during the 2016 election. A few months into quarantine, she got a job as a field representative for the Progressive Turnout Project, a grassroots political action committee. These days she might be writing personalized letters to voters or calling people to collect data on how many will be voting by mail in swing states.She doubts she\u2019ll go back to working in restaurants in the near future. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would be doing the things I liked doing,\u201d she says. Masks and distancing restrictions means she\u2019s less able to spend time talking to customers and making one-on-one connections. Her current role better allows for her to build deeper personal bonds over issues that matter to her.After her job ends on November 3, she plans to stay in advocacy. \u201cNo matter who gets elected, there is so much damage to the industry,\u201d she says. \u201cI think my role right now is better as someone fighting for restaurants.\u201dHow to help restaurant workers as they work to ensure a fair voting process and rebuild their industry, according to sources interviewed for this story:Follow The Chaad Project, an organization rooted in making the Chicago restaurant industry a more equitable place to work. (Lorraine Nguyen)Donate to Fair Fight, an organization started by Stacey Abrams that fights for free and fair elections for all. It is mainly based in Georgia, but its message is spreading nationally at a rapid pace. (Lauren Guild)Check out the League of Women Voters, which has been protecting and helping defend democracy for 100 years. The League works to get resources and information to voters in a nonpartisan way. Head to its website to find information relevant to your voting experience, fund the organization, or join a local chapter. (Vanessa Rao)Donate to Collective Nameless, an organization started by chefs in New York to combat food insecurity around the city, specifically in Black and brown neighborhoods.
