Quesabirria. Pie milkshakes. Pizza bagels. The great food mashups of our era. To this, please welcome two Valentine\u2019s Day heavy hitters, joined together in an unlikely union that really, really works: chocolate cheese.The pairing is not completely novel (just ask Ween). I like to add a little chevre to chocolate frosting to make it extra tangy, and in parts of Latin America, a cube of Edam or queso fresco is stirred into frothy hot chocolate. Also: chocolate cheesecake. But all these iterations require preparation. The fastest route to chocolate cheese is this Cave Aged Triple Cr\u00e8me de Cocoa, a limited-edition wheel dropping today at Murray\u2019s Cheese.Photo courtesy Murray'sCave Aged Triple Creme de Cocoa$48 at Murray's Cheese (price per pound)Murray\u2019s starts with unaged rounds of St. Stephen triple cream, a dense, buttery cow\u2019s milk cheese from Four Fat Fowl in New York\u2019s Hudson Valley. The wheels are sliced in half across the equator, and a thin layer of melted chocolate\u2014a dark milk from French chocolatier Pralus\u2014is poured on top. The halves are then put back together and the rounds spend two weeks aging in a cave, a romantic honeymoon period during which the chocolate and cheese get real cozy and familiar. The result is a cheese that, when sliced open, resembles a Morbier or Humboldt Fog\u2014except instead of a horizontal vein of ash, it\u2019s chocolate.The chocolate is a fruity, bitter foil to the richness of the triple cream, but it\u2019s also measured and subtle, playing nice with both sweet and savory flavors. I tried it on Moonshot sourdough crackers with a swipe of strawberry, chipotle, and fig Trade Street jam. I paired it with black sesame crunchy butter on vanilla shortbread cookies. I wrapped it in Bayonne ham. I ate it cold from the fridge and heated in a cheese baker until slightly runny. I wondered how \u201climited\u201d this limited edition was and if I could get my hands on several more wheels.Like Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton, some initially perplexing couples end up making a lot of sense, if you think about it. Chocolate and cheese, I wish you many years of continued happiness.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
