French meringue is the basic version with egg whites and granulated sugar, Italian meringue uses sugar syrup instead of granulated sugar, and Swiss meringue\u2014which I use here\u2014is made by first heating egg whites and sugar over a double boiler before beating them. It makes a dense, glossy, marshmallow-like meringue, which is perfect over a scoop of ice cream and slice of pound cake to make a baked Alaska. This is a \u2018WOW\u2019 dessert that you can make ahead, freeze, and bake just before serving.Reprinted from Cook Like a Pro: Recipes & Tips for Home Cooks. Copyright \u00a9 2018 by Ina Garten.

Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 4 minutes. Transfer raspberry mixture to a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Add jam and liqueur and process until smooth. Transfer to an airtight container and chill.Step 2Do Ahead: Sauce can be made 1 week ahead. Keep chilled.Cake and AssemblyStep 3Slice cake into six \u00bd\"-thick slices. Cut out six 2\u00bd\"-diameter circles\u2014one from each slice\u2014with an unfluted round cookie cutter; discard scraps. (You can also use a small knife.) Place rounds 2\" apart on a flat dish that will fit in your freezer.Step 4Soften sorbet and ice cream just enough to be able to scoop them with a standard 2\u00bc\"-diameter ice cream scoop (15\u201330 seconds in the microwave works). Fill half the scoop with sorbet and the rest of the scoop with ice cream. Arrange scoop of sorbet/ice cream flat side down in the center of each round. Freeze until ice cream is very hard, at least 30 minutes.Step 5Meanwhile, preheat oven to 500\u00b0. Heat egg whites and sugar in a medium heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water, whisking constantly, until a candy thermometer registers 120\u00b0 and sugar is dissolved. Pour mixture into a large bowl. Add vanilla, cream of tartar, and salt. Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat 1 minute, then increase speed to high and beat until egg whites form stiff, glossy peaks, about 5 minutes.Step 6Transfer rounds to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Working quickly, spread meringue with a spoon or small spatula over rounds and sorbet/ice cream, making lots of peaks all over with the back of the spoon. (You can also use a pastry bag fitted with a large fluted tip and pipe meringue thickly around each ball of ice cream and cake.) Be sure all of the sorbet/ice cream is covered with meringue. Bake, rotating pan once halfway through, until edges of meringues are browned, 2\u00bd\u20133 minutes. Divide among plates, drizzle fresh raspberry sauce around meringues, and serve immediately.Step 7Do Ahead: Baked Alaskas can be assembled 3 days ahead. Keep frozen\u2014but don\u2019t cover them, because the meringue won\u2019t freeze hard and you\u2019ll ruin the piping. Bake before serving.How would you rate Ina Garten\u2019s Raspberry Baked Alaska?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkExplore Bon App\u00e9titFrozen DessertDessertRaspberryBerryFruitNut-FreeBakingRecipes you want to make.
