It took her 15 tries, but somehow she made it manageable for home cooks. Here\u2019s how she did it.By Alyse WhitneyNovember 1, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Emma FishmanFacebookTwitterEmailIna Garten is Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s guest editor this week. Take a look into her pantry, read celebrity and chef odes to their favorite Ina recipes, watch her and food director Carla Lalli Music make chocolate-pecan scones, and read more from her guest-editing week here.\u00a0\n\u00a0Staring into a bowl of egg whites, I felt a sudden surge of anxiety. During the hop from one half of a cracked eggshell to the other, I had accidentally let the yolk drop, and completely ruined a batch of meringue that I was making...with Ina Garten. \u201cMaybe we can fish it out?\u201d I stammered. She calmly corrected me: \u201cOne drop of yolk will keep the meringue from whipping. Don\u2019t worry, it happens to everyone. Just start over.\u201dBefore this day in Ina\u2019s East Hampton kitchen, baked Alaska wasn\u2019t on my radar. It seemed like an entirely unapproachable and totally outdated dish from the canon of 1950s Americana cuisine. But that\u2019s not how Ina saw it.The raspberry sorbet and vanilla ice cream soften slightly and swirl together, saturating the pound cake underneath.\nPhoto by Emma Fishman\u201cI wanted to take a complicated recipe and make it as simple as possible,\u201d she said of her single-serving, raspberry-vanilla version, which appears in her newest cookbook, Cook Like a Pro. Garten has always been known for simple home cooking, but with this book\u2014her 11th\u2014she aims to elevate everyday cuisine with \u201cpro tips\u201d culled from decades of her own experience, plus advice from chefs like Yotam Ottolenghi and Jean-Georges Vongerichten. Little tricks like cutting carrots on a diagonal before roasting or swooshing hummus on the bottom of a Mediterranean salad are just a few of the techniques she offers. \u201cIt should look professional, but you don\u2019t need to be a pro to make it,\u201d she said. Of all the recipes that made it into the book, the baked Alaska was the one Ina struggled with most to make doable at home.Sometimes Garten gets a recipe right in two tries; other times it takes 24. Baked Alaska took her 15 attempts. The biggest hangup for her and her assistants, Lidey Heuck and Barbara Libath, was figuring out the two-flavor ice cream combination. \u201cYou don't want one flavor to hit you in the head and another one to get lost.\u201d She tried passionfruit and vanilla, which was a little too sweet, and contemplated coffee and chocolate, but ultimately went for raspberry and vanilla, an ode to her love of raspberry cr\u00e8me, in a swirled scoop.The next part of the process was to eliminate the grandiose, intimidating elements and offer some shortcuts to make things easier. That included the suggestion to purchase good-quality raspberry sorbet and vanilla ice cream (according to Garten, Talenti and H\u00e4agen-Dazs make the best, respectively) for the filling and store-bought pound cake for the base. \u201cIt\u2019s such a small part of the dessert that it\u2019s not worth making from scratch,\u201d she says of the latter. She advises to make sure it\u2019s the best quality possible, which means it should be \u201cnice and brown, and look like it\u2019s oozing butter.\u201dAs for that meringue, Garten tested three major types\u2014French with egg whites and granulated sugar, Italian with sugar syrup, and Swiss with the sugar heated in a double boiler before whipping\u2014before settling on the last. She most appreciated how its \u201cmarshmallow-like\u201d texture held up best after baking, a less intimidating final step than a go with a blowtorch to brown the top. Together, we babysat the meringue until it came to temperature\u2014she advises investing in a candy thermometer to make sure it reaches exactly 120\u00b0F\u2014before whipping it into stiff, glossy peaks.Garten went sharp with meringue peaks so they brown in the oven.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanAfter the mixture cooled slightly, Garten filled a pastry bag and piped big, dramatic stars atop her marbled ice cream ball while I swooshed mine with an offset spatula. When developing the recipe, she tried six different styles of piping, but decided to let readers choose their own adventure. The only thing that mattered was making sure the entire filling was encased in meringue before putting it in the oven, so none of the ice cream melts out and the exterior can get bronzed.\u201cMake as many peaks as possible, because those are what get the most color in the oven,\u201d she instructed. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be messy, but that\u2019s okay\u2014I\u2019m a messy cook,\u201d she said, unphased as meringue spilled out of the bag and down her hand. \u201cDo it when nobody's looking for the first time\u2014don't do it for a dinner party. I know I cook and talk for a living, but it's really hard to do. I don't wanna be piping when friends are watching!\u201dA drizzle of raspberry sauce\u2014made with seedless jam, raspberries, and sugar\u2014finishes the dish with a pop of color.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanIf Garten was serving baked Alaska at a party, she\u2019d serve them on one of the vintage cake stands she\u2019s collected over the years. Here they are on display in her study.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanWatching Garten cook on TV comes with witnessing her seemingly effortless East Hampton lifestyle\u2014the spotless white kitchen, her friends who drop by for dinner with a floral arrangement in hand, and her loving husband Jeffrey who dubs every dish his \u201cfavorite\u201d\u2014and as I walked through her gardens later that afternoon, picking fresh shishito peppers, the word \u201caspirational\u201d very much came to mind. But with her recipes, it all somehow feels within reach: For the Barefoot Contessa, accessibility and wow factor are not mutually exclusive.After pulling the dessert from the oven, we surveyed our work. \u201cIt\u2019s like that scene with Julia Child and Martha Stewart making croquembouche,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you ever see that bit? Martha\u2019s looked like she\u2019d done it with a precision instrument, and Julia looks at Martha and goes, \u2018Mine looks like a pile of rocks.\u2019\u201d She laughed heartily, then reassured me that she couldn\u2019t tell the difference between my attempt and hers.Garten and I enjoy the fruits of our labor.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanI had nothing to compare it to, having never tried a baked Alaska before, but it struck a nice balance of tart and sweet. I was skeptical we\u2019d be able to make this dessert in the five hours I was scheduled to be with Ina; it took less than an hour.. But that\u2019s the Garten magic\u2014she strives to demystify a perceived challenge and empower readers to cook something new.\u201cRecipes should be impressive, not intimidating,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen someone gets to a trickier part of a recipe, I want to make it feel like I\u2019m standing right there next to them, helping them through their problems.\u201d And, if you can\u2019t have Ina Garten by your side in the kitchen, rest assured, store-bought ice cream is just fine.\u00a0Get the recipe for Ina\u2019s baked Alaska here.\u00a0And read more from Ina Garten\u2019s guest editing week here!Explore Bon App\u00e9titIna GartenCelebritiesDessertIce CreamSorbetRead MorecultureA Letter from Our Guest Editor, Ina GartenBy Ina GartencultureIna Garten\u2019s Grocery List Includes Whiskey Sour Supplies and Impulse CookiesBy Alyse WhitneycultureNeil Patrick Harris and David Burtka Built Their Relationship on Ina Garten\u2019s GuacamoleBy Neil Patrick Harris and David BurtkacultureNancy Meyers Won\u2019t Throw a Party Without Ina Garten\u2019s Sun-Dried Tomato DipBy Nancy MeyersRecipes you want to make.
