I\u2019m Obsessed With Making Perfect CookiesThere\u2019s really only one good way to tell the difference between 1/4-inch and 1/2-inch\u2014and no, it\u2019s not to eyeball it.By Sarah JampelDecember 18, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie CraigFacebookTwitterEmailThese trusty, cheerful pastry rulers saved me from myself. Without their help, I surely would have perished in my pursuit to bake 400-plus sugar cookies for a big party (okay, it was a wedding; okay, it was my wedding).Hold up: What even is a pastry ruler? I first learned about these dead-simple tools when I was baking 300 sandwich cookies a week (do you sense a trend?) at a small caf\u00e9, and I ordered a set of my own when I grasped the enormity of my wedding cookie task. The rulers I bought come in a set of three Lifesaver-colored couples that are themselves 1/16-,  3/16-, and 1/4-inch thick. Select the thickness you want (1/4-inch for cookies, but maybe a bit thinner\u2014like 3/16\u2014for pie, and even thinner still for fondant or, godspeed, pasta) and position your dough in between a pair. When you move the rolling pin along them like a track, you\u2019ll squish the dough into the exact thickness of the bars surrounding it, no thinner or thicker.I favor the sturdy plastic rulers over the Silicone sets: Since Silicone is squishy, there\u2019s a chance that if you Hulk out and push too hard, you\u2019ll accidentally get a thinner dough than desired.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigThis is great because, let\u2019s be real: When\u2019s the last time you took a ruler to your dough and tried to measure its height? It\u2019s impossible! And can anyone who doesn\u2019t roll dough on the reg visualize the difference between 1/4 inch and 1/8 inch? That\u2019s crazy talk! The pastry rulers guarantee that you\u2019ve rolled an even slab of dough to the thickness specified by the recipe, which means that baking times will be more reliable, elusive textures (crispy or flaky or tender) will be more achievable, and cookie batches will bake more evenly.Sure, pastry rulers aren\u2019t the only path to uniform dough, but they are the most versatile. The alternatives include Silicone rings that screw into a corresponding pin, elevating it the desired height above the work surface, and the Epicurious-endorsed J.K. Adams Lovely Rolling Pin, a beautiful pin ingeniously designed to yield 1/4-inch dough every time. (Or, get a set that includes a sibling 1/8-inch pin). With both of these designs, the issue is the same: You\u2019re stuck with a speciality pin that probably can\u2019t be used in every single way you\u2019d like. And before you know it, you\u2019ll end up with a whole drawer of rolling pins, and who has space for that?I\u2019d rather have a singular fancy stick\u2014dead-simple but exceedingly useful\u2014in my drawer, just so long as I also have the pastry rulers that make me feel like a card-carrying Cookier ready for CookieCon.Buy it: Autumn Carpenter Pastry Rulers, Set of 6, $20 at Kitchen JukeboxAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
