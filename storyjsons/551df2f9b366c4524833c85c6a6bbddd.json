The best ones are tricky to find (see: pasta hand-shaped in Italy, saffron from Iran) or, ahem, illegal (see: unpasteurized cheese smuggled in from France*, tonka beans smuggled in from England*, raw milk from a farm upstate). They might be homemade, or highly personal, or, even better, luxurious-feeling things\u2014the sort of item you\u2019d hesitate to buy for yourself but feel incredibly grateful to own.Vanilla bean paste falls squarely into that last subsection. It\u2019s on the pricey side, but any baker would love to have it\u2014and not just to look at, but to actually use.While I refuse to speak negatively against vanilla beans\u2014a veritable gift from the heavens\u2014I will say that vanilla bean paste, which consists of seeds suspended in extract, is relatively less expensive and more convenient to use (the splitting and scraping has been done for you). Typically, one teaspoon of paste is the equivalent of one vanilla bean, which means that you\u2019ll turn out batches of cookies, cakes, puddings, jams, and simple syrups before the jar runs out.Compared to vanilla extract, paste has a more intense flavor (you\u2019ll taste the difference in any vanilla-forward desserts, like shortbread, custards, yellow cake, whipped cream). Plus, it gives you those signature seed flecks, which are not only beautiful but also scream, \u201cThis is going to taste like vanilla!!!\u201d That\u2019s what makes paste an excellent gift and extract a less great one.My jar of choice is the super potent Heilala vanilla bean paste. It smells so good that I instinctively take a huge whiff every time I bake with it. The company started in 2002 as an aid project to bolster the economy of Tonga in the South Pacific after a cyclone, and the vanilla is grown sustainably and pollinated by hand\u2014so you can feel good about buying a jar for a friend. Then drop a hint that some vanilla-flecked cookies would make a pretty great thank you in return... ;)Heilala Vanilla Bean Paste$15 at Amazon*Legally, I cannot recommend you do either of these things! But personally, I would accept either as a spectacular anytime present, should you wish to bestow them upon me.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendShoppingRead MorecultureThe Test Kitchen Swears By This Cookie and Cake CarrierBy MacKenzie Chung FeganRecipes you want to make.
