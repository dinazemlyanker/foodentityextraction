But what does that mean exactly?By Alex BeggsJune 4, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Kevin Fleming/Corbis via Getty ImagesFacebookTwitterEmailNothing makes me want to vomit into the pockets of my linen jumpsuit like the scene in Lady and the Tramp when the two doggos share a splattering plate of sauced-up spaghetti.

Woefully unsexy.I\u2019m not the only one who feels this way.
