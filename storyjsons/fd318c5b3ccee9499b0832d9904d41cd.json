It\u2019s tangy, a little sweet, and extra fizzy, which also makes it perfect for your next outdoor summer party. If you\u2019re in a pinch and can\u2019t find perfect peaches, don't sweat: The frozen ones work surprisingly well, too.Ingredients6 Servings1lb. ripe peaches or nectarines, cut into wedges, or frozen, thawed sliced peaches2oz.

Disappointing. AnonymousGeneva, Switzerland 8/6/2021I was really disappointed in this. The fruit added no flavor and there was very little flavor from the Aperol or Averna. The fruit sucked up most of the bubbly and we only got two glasses out of it (and it took 4 peaches!). I couldn't let it sit because the bubbles would dissipate and it would warm up. Frustrating.Mari K-CGrand Rapids, MI7/18/20212 oz in the whole pitcher! The ros\u00e9 is what makes it boozy. The aperol is more for flavor here. It's a sangria riff.AnonymousOregon7/14/20212 Oz of aperol in the whole pitcher? Or per glass? Is this a typo?
