I never had anything like it in the States: a milkshake with rose syrup, pistachios, raisins, and crunchy noodles. I loved it. For the restaurant, I wanted to put all those flavors into a dessert.\u201d This unconventional panna cotta uses tangy yogurt in the base, which helps offset the sweetness of the rose syrup.Ingredients8 servings\u00bdcup raw pistachios1envelope unflavored powdered gelatin (about 2\u00bd tsp.)1\u00bdcups plain Greek yogurt1Tbsp. rose syrup1\u00bccups heavy cream, divided\u00bdcup sugar1Tbsp. basil seeds (tukmaria) or chia seeds (optional)\u00bdcup golden raisinsBlackberries (for serving; optional)PreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 350\u00b0.

Rose is such a wonderful flavor.  My great-grandmother made a salad of pink rose petals and lobster (this was a long time ago when lobster was still considered poor man's food) that I recreated a few years ago that was just delicious. Kudos to Bon Appetit having rose recipes. I will definitely make this soon as it has my favorite ingredients.arbpen9300Glendale7/30/2020I'm Italian, a real Panna Cotta purist. I was nervous about this recipe..... But I will definitely be making this again soon! This is the type of Panna Cotta you could eat for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The Greek yogurt gives it such a unique taste and texture and the toppings match oh so well\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffd.
