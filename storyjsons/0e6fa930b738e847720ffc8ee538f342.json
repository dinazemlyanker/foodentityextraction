It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Cabbage patch adultsOur most popular recipe of the week was Andy Baraghani\u2019s new Healthyish fall-apart caramelized cabbage. I want to make it this weekend. Cabbage is so cheap and it gets so meltingly tender\u2014or crispy-edged awesome\u2014whatever you want it to be. Raw, crisp slaw if you must! I asked Andy, whose cabbage gratin in the Thanksgiving issue turned me into a certified cabbage head, \u201cIs this cabbage\u2019s year?\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s become my favorite vegetable,\u201d he confessed.

I love how much this old cookbook captures a previous era (so many aspics), but if you prefer to live in the present, make sure to grab a copy of the Joy\u2019s latest edition, at long last. If you\u2019re ever stranded on a deserted island and find a fully stocked pantry buried in the sand\u2014maybe a cast iron pan has washed ashore, I dunno, a seagull drops some tongs\u2014this is the book you\u2019ll need. That\u2019s why it\u2019s our Cookbook Club book for February! You have ~4,600 recipes to choose from.

Molly Baz propped her foot on a drawer at her station in the Test Kitchen and weighed her hands like Lady Justice: \u201cA galette is all of the glory of the pie without all of the trouble,\u201d she said. \u201cThe deliciousness effect is the same, but the effort is minimal. It\u2019s a cost benefit analysis!\u201d \u201cThis question is overly simplified and I can\u2019t answer it,\u201d said Claire Saffitz before she was yanked away by her director to make something I can\u2019t disclose gourmet. \u201cPIE FOR LIFE,\u201d said Sohla El-Waylly. \u201cMaking a lattice is the best thing ever.\u201d Yeah, if you can do it! It\u2019s hard! \u201cYou can make a lattice on a galette Sohla\u201d one-upped Jampel, who prefers a galette except in the cases of [lists 17 exceptions]. Elyse Inamine and I prefer galette because WE LOVE CRUST. \u201cGalette, specifically for the bite where the crust folds over itself,\u201d said Amanda Shapiro. \u201cIt\u2019s like a stuffed crust pizza.\u201d Whoa. \u201cHand pie!\u201d voted off-topic Hilary Cadigan. \u201cAll pies are hand pies, if you believe,\u201d said Joseph Hernandez, inspirationally. And then the discussion devolved into talk of Hot Pockets, Pop Tarts, and whether adding ice to seltzer flattens it quicker.Get the recipe: Fall Fruit GaletteExplore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecookingSummer Is Over but Galettes Are ForeverBy Carla Lalli MusiccookingJust Try Not Going Back for Seconds of This Over-the-Top Cabbage GratinBy Jill BaughmanLifestyleHow to Turn a Vegetable Into a MealBy Amanda ShapirocultureA Case for Three Copies of the Joy of CookingBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
