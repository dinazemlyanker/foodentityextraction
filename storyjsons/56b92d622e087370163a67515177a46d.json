You figured out a menu that would somehow accommodate your two vegetarian friends, your one Paleo friend, and your three friends who are doing Whole30. You just spent what felt like three hours (and the GDP of a small Baltic principality) at the cheese counter selecting some Fine Fromage. You know what you absolutely don\u2019t have time to think about right now? Which of the 10,000 varieties of crackers on offer at the store are going in your cart. Fortunately, we\u2019ve made the choice for you: Carr\u2019s Table Water Crackers, the only cracker you should ever serve with cheese. End of story. Always and forever.I once read a Vanity Fair article\u2014well, technically it was paraphrased to me, so sue me\u2014about how, during his presidency, Barack Obama sought to eliminate as many frivolous choices from his day as possible to cut down on \u201cdecision fatigue.\u201d He alternated between grey and black suits exclusively, and had a staffer order for him whenever he was at a restaurant. Which made sense to me\u2014when you\u2019re the leader of the free world, making decisions all day long that affect the lives of millions if not billions of people, you don\u2019t want to waste any of your finite decision-making energies trying to choose between the chicken and the fish. And while I am not Obama, and you are not Obama (unless you are, in which case, WOW HI!), I think we can all agree that picking crackers is a frivolous endeavor, a decision better to not waste energy on. So, again: Carr\u2019s Table Water Crackers.Why though? Why Carr\u2019s Table Water Crackers and not, say, Triscuits or Stoned Wheat Thins or rice crackers or any of the seemingly-infinite options out there? Let\u2019s get down to brass tacks, shall we. For one, Carr\u2019s are plain without being bland. Delicately crispy, with the faintest toastiness, they\u2019re not interested in upstaging any of the fancy-ass cheeses you dropped dime on\u2014they\u2019re there to support, not shine. There\u2019s something almost spiritually austere about them (I\u2019ve heard Catholics compare them to communion wafers and Jews liken them to matzo) and they read\u2014simply, familiarly, ineluctably\u2014as crackers. Not chips. Not bread. Not everything bagels. Crackers. And as such there\u2019s absolutely zero risk that anyone is going to snack on them on their own. Bonus: They\u2019re cheap!But I love my $15 Nut and Fruit Everything Bagel Bonanaza Crackers! They\u2019re, like, soooo goooood!Fine. I\u2019m not going to yuck your yum. Buy those artisanal-whatever hand-crafter crackers, but if you do, don\u2019t even spend one second thinking about what kind of cheese you\u2019re going to buy to put on them. Grab the closest hunk of orange cheddar or log of affectless ch\u00e8vre and get gone.If you care about cheese, though, and pick it out lovingly, with excitement and anticipation and every intention of savoring it to its fullest savor around a dinner table of your closest friends...well, you know what to do. Carr\u2019s. Carr\u2019s. Carr\u2019s. This time, and the next time, and every time after that.Buy It: Carr\u2019s Table Water Crackers are $3.50 on AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titCheeseCheese WeekCrackerRecipes you want to make.
