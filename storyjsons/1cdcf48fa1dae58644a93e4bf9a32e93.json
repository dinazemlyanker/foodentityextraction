They\u2019ll get to the dinner table faster than dried, but open up the can, rinse off those bad bean boys (or not), and you\u2019ve still got a product that needs some help: A few minutes to marinate in oil and vinegar. A dance through hot oil fragrant with garlic and spices, a handful of greens and a glug of wine. Mayonnaise. \u00a0And that\u2019s where A Dozen Cousins comes in. This line of ready-to-eat beans, which come in bags rather than cans, are actually ready to eat. Warm them up in the microwave or on the stove and...that\u2019s it. Because they\u2019re already seasoned and spiced, bolstered by real vegetables, like garlic, onions, and peppers, and avocado oil, you don\u2019t have to dig through the pantry or break out the cutting board. They\u2019re delicious on their own. They\u2019ve been there for me when I\u2019ve been near-stupefied with exhaustion. I\u2019ve had the Mexican Cowboy Beans tucked in tortillas, the Cuban Black Beans with leftover rice, and my personal fave, the Trini Chickpea Curry, with roti from the freezer and saut\u00e9ed greens.The beans are the brainchild of Ibraheem Basir, who worked at a number of national food brands before launching his own. He loved the ethos of the natural food space, with its emphasis on health, but noticed that there weren\u2019t many (or any) products that channeled the food he grew up eating in the Fort Greene and Clinton Hill neighborhoods of Brooklyn, with flavors from the West African, Caribbean, Latin American, and African American communities. And most were devoid of the feelings of comfort and love that those foods of his childhood provided. He saw an opportunity to merge health, comfort, and culture in beans: While the Bean Biz is worth nearly three billion dollars, Basir told me, the products don\u2019t reflect the ingredients\u2019 culinary significance or range. In most stores, the selection of ready-to-eat beans is limited\u2014either refried or baked. A Dozen Cousins, on the other hand, expands the scope, drawing inspiration from the American South, Latin America, and the Caribbean.And, in a time when some big bean brands are hard to stomach (I\u2019ll leave it at that, thankyouverymuch), I can feel good about buying A Dozen Cousins, which provides an annual grant to a different non-profit working to counter the socio-economic health disparities that disproportionately affect Black and brown communities. In 2019, the recipient was Austin-based organization The Happy Kitchen/La Cucina Alegre (the 2020 recipient hasn\u2019t been announced yet!). Basir started this fund as a way to provide support to individuals, families, and communities who wouldn\u2019t necessarily have the means to buy his products. \u201cIn an ideal world,\u201d says Basir, \u201cyour health wouldn\u2019t be tied to your socio-economic status at all.\u201dThere\u2019s a lot of work that needs to happen before we can get to that point\u2014and these beans will fuel it.Buy it: A Dozen Cousins Cuban Black Beans, Trini Chickpea Curry, Mexican Cowboy Beans, $20 at WalmartAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
