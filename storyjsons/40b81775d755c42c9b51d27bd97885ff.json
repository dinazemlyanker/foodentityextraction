We\u2019d pile into the back row of her family\u2019s giant SUV and slowly make our way out of their gated driveway. Carrabba\u2019s was on a busy stretch of road next to an Outback, a Japanese-fusion spot, and a Weight Watchers. When we walked in, the hostess greeted the entire family like they were famous. I had no idea what a \u201cregular\u201d at a restaurant was, but as with everything in Mo\u2019s life, it was something to aspire to.The kids always got Carrabba\u2019s oven-fired pizza. Her parents the Chicken Marsala, or Chicken Bryan. Frank Sinatra was playing on the speakers and Mo\u2019s family knew the lyrics. This is as close as it got to a red sauce joint for me. I can\u2019t remember a single restaurant from my Texas childhood that transported me anywhere other than out of the heat, into the A/C. This chain Italian food, though, it felt special. It felt fancy. The music even played in the bathroom. I had so much of life yet to figure out.I grew up, I figured the stuff out, and I forgot about Carrabba\u2019s. Until three years ago, when I started working at this fancy food magazine, where only a few of my colleagues had heard of the restaurant. I wanted to write something about Carrabba\u2019s, so I talked to Joel Barker, VP of research and development at Carrabba\u2019s. He mentioned that Chicken Bryan recently \u201ctook off.\u201d Fans continue to profess their love on Twitter (\u201cDamn Carrabba\u2019s prices have almost doubled but I\u2019ll pay anything for the Chicken Bryan,\u201d says @jeff1uk), bloggers replicate the recipe and write odes to the dish that veer on rapture. People are (still!) obsessed with CHICKEN BRYAN.After all those sleepovers, I\u2019d never had the legend, the phenomenon that is Chicken Bryan. A juicy grilled boneless, skinless chicken breast topped with a precise circular patty of goat cheese, a sprinkle of sun-dried tomatoes, and a dousing of lemon-butter-wine sauce. 680 calories. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. Why is this, in a world with heavy cream\u2013based fettuccine, the most popular dish on the Carrabba\u2019s menu? Boneless, skinless chicken breast? Sun-dried tomatoes?! And who the hell is Bryan? It\u2019s just so...random. I stewed on it. And I waited until now, in honor of Red Sauce America, to search for the answers.A pretty generous portion of lemon-butter sauce, I see.\nPhoto by Lisa DiederichI\u2019m going to break the spell right now and tell you that Chicken Bryan isn\u2019t named after a guy named Bryan who smoked a bowl and plopped some goat cheese on a grilled chicken breast before riding into the sunset. It\u2019s named after the town of Bryan, Texas, where the Carrabba family settled when they arrived from Sicily in the 1890s. Carrabba\u2019s was created in 1986 by Johnny Carrabba and his uncle Damian Mandola. They mined their family\u2019s Sicilian history, their grandma\u2019s recipes, and then invented their own, like Chicken Bryan, originally named Chicken Bryan Texas around 1989\u201390. There\u2019s no solid explanation for the ingredient combination other than it just happened one recipe-testing day and stuck. \u201cI always said Carrabba\u2019s is ten years ahead of our time,\u201d Barker said. \u201cJohnny and Damian aren\u2019t nervous to put these big, bold flavors together.\u201dOne of Chicken Bryan\u2019s biggest fans is Dash of Sanity blogger Sandra McCollum, whose family were regulars at the Fort Collins, Colorado, Carrabba\u2019s for years. \u201cThey know we want extra sauce on everything,\u201d McCollum said to me over the phone. She brought the staff her famous Christmas coffee cake during the holidays, knew the franchise owner by name, and even\u2014please hold\u2014went into labor at Carrabba\u2019s, while her husband was\u2014yes!\u2014eating Chicken Bryan. (McCollum likes the Sicilian chicken soup, a salad, and the chocolate dream dessert.) After she gave birth to her daughter, she opted for Carrabba\u2019s takeout instead of the hospital\u2019s complimentary steak and lobster dinner for new parents (no, I don\u2019t know what hospital this was).\u201cIt\u2019s the best ever,\u201d she said of Chicken Bryan with her husband on the line to join in. \u201cNothing overpowers anything.\u201d She posits that the secret is the grill seasoning (a simple spice mix). Husband chimes in: \u201cWhat\u2019s underrated is that rough-cut fresh basil. You get that super savory, salty base, the citrus through the lemon butter sauce, and\u201d\u2014he lets out a guttural umh!\u2014 \u201ca little sweetness from the basil.\u201d Aha!I needed to taste Chicken Bryan myself. This required obtaining a car and planning an outing to Secaucus, New Jersey, the closest Carrabba\u2019s to the island of Manhattan. This Carrabba\u2019s is next to an Outback and an LA Fitness. Inside, Sinatra was swinging and the Diet Coke was flowing. I was nearly bouncing out of my booth to say the words, I\u2019ll have the Chicken Bryan. (Side of garlic mashed potatoes, please, and the Caesar salad.) More than half of the plate was taken up by the two sloppy plops of mashed potatoes. The Bryan snuck into a wedge between them. The circles of goat cheese were cold and firm, the sun-dried tomatoes placed in their centers, and basil scattered between, creating this sort of owl face. Well, Bryan. We finally meet.The CB was perfectly cooked and juicy (and it\u2019s a breast, remember?!). I wanted more sauce, more sunny-T\u2019s. My dining companion ordered the Pasta Weesie (shrimp, scallions, a creamy Alfredo sauce, named for a founder's niece, per VP Barker), which I liked best. The pasta was fresh and delicate. The service was genuinely warm and friendly. The zucchine fritte had the lightest fry batter, irresistible. This place, I realized, is so much better than that other more famous, ubiquitous Italian chain.Carrabba\u2019s family photos\u2014and some wine\u2014adorn the walls of the restaurant nationwide.\nPhoto by Lisa DiederichAnd finally, I needed to make Chicken Bryan myself, straight from the Carrabba\u2019s cookbook. First I mixed up Carrabba\u2019s grill seasoning: salt and pepper, dried oregano, granulated garlic, granulated onion, and red pepper flakes. Then I made the basil-lemon-butter sauce: lemon juice, clarified butter, white wine, onion, and garlic. At the very end, you add in fresh basil and sun-dried tomatoes. I grilled the seasoned, pounded chicken indoors on a carbon steel pan (I wasn\u2019t able to grill it over pecan and oak as they do at the restaurants). On the plate, I topped the breasts with imperfect circles of goat cheese and doused everything in the delicious basil-lemon-butter sauce, which was more flavorful than what I\u2019d had in New Jersey the day before. That\u2019s right: CB two days in a ROW! I served it with steamed asparagus to my Texan friend Tarik and told him it was an upcoming Bon App\u00e9tit recipe. I thought this would be a clever prank. He\u2019d wonder what direction BA was going in. Where was the Aleppo pepper, the fennel salad? But the joke was on me, the snobby food writer, because...he loved it.Me: \u201cDo you think you\u2019d make this at home?\u201dTarik: \u201c...yeah, actually.\u201dMe: \u201cWhy?\u201dTarik: \u201cI like the lemon sauce, the goat cheese, and I really like sun-dried tomatoes but I\u2019ve never cooked with them.\u201dMe: \u201cDoes it feel modern to you?\u201dTarik: \u201cIt\u2019s chicken breast and asparagus, so, uh, no.\u201dMe: \u201cWell it\u2019s 30 years old. It\u2019s Chicken Bryan! From Carrabba\u2019s! Italian! Grill!\u201dTarik: \u201cWhat\u2019s Carrabba\u2019s?\u201dSo that experiment failed. But it was an easy, healthyish lunch. I traced my finger in the saucepan and licked it clean. There were no leftovers, which was too bad. Because Chicken Bryan, three days in a row, would have been an honorable streak. I\u2019d have felt, you know, like some kind of regular.Alex Beggs is a senior staff writer at Bon App\u00e9tit.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsItalian AmericanRed SauceRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
