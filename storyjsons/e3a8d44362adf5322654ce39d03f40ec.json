I actually grew up in a vegetarian family in Mumbai but would sneak out and eat them at roadside stalls with friends (in India, they\u2019re a popular street food, traditionally cooked in a tandoor). I\u2019ve never been able to get enough of the smell of charcoal smoke and these juicy skewers of piping-hot, char-grilled meat. Serve them with mint chutney and flatbread.If you can\u2019t find ground chicken at your local grocery store, you can absolutely substitute ground turkey. You can also easily make ground chicken yourself even without a meat grinder. Simply cut skinless, boneless chicken thighs into small chunks, freeze for five minutes or until firm, and pulse in batches in a food processor until the meat is finely minced. \u2014Chintan Pandya, Adda, Queens, NYThis recipe is part of Short Is Sweet, our collection of summer dishes that deliver a whole lot of deliciousness in 30 minutes or less.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

This recipe is healthful and flavorful. We did encounter the same skewer holding problem as the previous reviewer but found by quickly rotating for the first minute or so the meat \"sealed\" and held. Chef CourtAppleton, WI7/30/2021The meat was very tasty, but could not get it to hold its form on the skewer which spelt disaster on the grill.  I ended up serving cooked crumbled chicken.  I assume my ground chicken was too moist- maybe I should have added bread crumbs to firm is up.Steve KOK7/22/2021Kala Jeera is not carraway seeds. That's cumin. Which one is supposed to be used?RV7/15/2021Wow - this packs a ton of flavor and despite only finding ground chicken breast, stayed super moist and tender!  We did leave out the caraway and mace (not a fan of either, so glad they were optional).  Quite spicy, but just right for our palettes.  Served similar to shawarma/gyro - on warmed pita with veggies and sour cream.  We plan to do a larger batch next time to freeze extras for a quick and easy weeknight dinner!LBinTXTexas7/12/2021These were fantastic. The spices and the herbs were so delicious together. I honestly didn't bother to skewer but shaped them into little rolls and pan fried. Very good. Diana Z.Philadelphia, PA7/5/2021@Anisha Seth - probably sharp cheddar, as it says in the recipe.Jo KennaBoston, MA7/5/2021Generally want to use cold meat and work it a bit so it gets paste like consistently Bill St Paul 7/2/2021We can\u2019t get amul cheese in Canada for some reason. What would you suggest as a sub?Anisha SethEdmonton, AB, CAN6/28/2021@Darcied.... tell us more about the mushroom condiment, that sounds amazing!MikeShanghai6/24/2021Delicious, but had a terrible time with the kabobs falling apart off the skewers when grilling. Any tips?AnonymousBrooklyn ny6/13/2021Wonderful. Seasoning is perfect. I don't even have a grill, and didn't feel like heating the house with a broiler, so simply browned the meat, shaped like kebabs, on the griddle. Didn't brush with butter -perfectly tender and juicy without the butter. Served with homemade spiced mushroom chili-pepper condiment (similar to an oyster sauce but with jalapeno and garam masala etc, added).  This is the new burger. Thank you so much for this recipe.DarcieDDetroit5/31/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titSkewerIndianSouth AsianAsianGround ChickenChickenPoultryCheddarCheeseCilantroHerbs & SpicesMintCardamomMainGluten-FreeNut-FreeKetoHealthyishGrillingDinnerRecipes you want to make.
