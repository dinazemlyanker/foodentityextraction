Debating the definition of the word is like debating whether people see colors the same way. Is your \"natural\" wine like my \"natural\" quinoa? We\u2019re all on the same page about trans fats, thanks to the FDA\u2019s 2006 requirement that they be declared on Nutrition Labels. The same goes for \u201corganic,\u201d which the U.S. Department of Agriculture clarified in 2000 as being free of synthetic chemicals. But when it comes to defining \u201cnatural\u201d food, we\u2019re still on our own.The term first appeared on labels in the 1970s, and it rose in popularity as shoppers embraced the health-associated buzzword in their pantries. In 2015, about 60 percent of surveyed consumers thought packaged foods labeled \u201cnatural\u201d were made with no toxic pesticides, no artificial colors or ingredients, and no GMOs. Between 80 and 85 percent of them thought that \u201cnatural\u201d should indicate each of those three things.Last month, the FDA announced that it\u2019s close to issuing standards. The new rules would provide a real definition for everything but meat and poultry (the U.S. Department of Agriculture is responsible for the safety of meat, poultry and egg products, while the FDA regulates all other foods). Beef and chicken can only bear the word \u201cnatural\u201d if it has no artificial ingredients or added colors, and if it wasn\u2019t \u201cfundamentally altered\u201d during processing. (Don\u2019t sweat about finding \u201cnatural\u201d eggs: Those are always natural, according to the USDA.)Where the USDA took action in 1982, the FDA has dragged its feet. Efthimios Parasidis, a law professor at Ohio State University researching the natural claim says they have taken \u201cembarrassingly long\u201d to come up with a definition. Parasidis has studied the dozens of times upset customers have taken brands to court over claims of so-called \u201cnatural\u201d foods. So far, foods made with GMOs, high-fructose corn syrup, and artificial preservatives or coloring struggle the most to keep the term. Some brands are told to drop the label, while others had already let it go once they saw early lawsuits. Judges have also ruled in favor of customers more often in cases of processed foods, like cookies and energy bars\u2014in part because those foods are brought to court more often. If a product has dozens of ingredients and is formulated to be shelf-stable for years, there\u2019s a higher chance one of those additives won\u2019t make the \u201cnatural\u201d cut.Because most lawsuits revolve around ingredients, the FDA definition will probably focus on those. They could also limit how foods are produced, says Parasidis. Ionizing radiation, a shelf-life preservation tactic of aiming X rays at food to kill off bacteria, and using sewage sludge as fertilizer could be two processes that won\u2019t pass for \u201cnatural.\u201d Right now, the nine kinds of food that can be irradiated get a friendly green symbol on the package. If food is grown in the sanitized solid byproduct of wastewater treatments\u2014which happens on 1 percent of U.S. farmland\u2014it isn\u2019t marked at all. The only way to dodge these two in your groceries is to go organic, which bans them both.Speaking of organic, the potential \u201cnatural\u201d definition\u2014no artificial preservatives, GMOs, radiation or sludge\u2014sounds a lot like what organic already stipulates. And yes, there might be some crossover, says Parasidis. \u201cNatural\u201d might also be like organic in that it could have tiers. This is where qualifiers come in: organic foods can be \u201c100% organic,\u201d \u201corganic,\u201d or \u201cmade with organic ingredients.\u201d Each phrase signifies a percentage range, forcing brands to clarify how much of what they\u2019re selling fits the rules.So, say the FDA definition kicks in, and Parasidis\u2019s predictions are correct. How will that change what you see on the shelves? The artificial colors, preservatives, and GMOs most Americans think shouldn\u2019t be in natural foods probably won\u2019t be there. If brands decide it\u2019s worth the cost, some of your borderline-natural favorites might rise to the occasion with production and ingredient tweaks. If the FDA allows it, labels could take on qualifiers like \u201cmade with natural\u201d or \u201call natural.\u201dBased on the lawsuits so far, processed foods are more likely to straddle the line between tweaking for the new rules or abandoning the label. But fruits, veggies or grain brands might also choose losing the designation over growing in something more costly than sludge\u2014a choice you can\u2019t discern from the package, like you can by looking at the ingredient list for, say, high fructose corn syrup. If brands drop the \u201cnatural\u201d claim, they\u2019ll probably drop in price, too.In the past, FDA definitions have boosted sales of accurately labeled products \u2014 this happened with trans fats. Julie Caswell, an economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, studied how many \u201ctrans-fat free\u201d margarines people bought before and after brands could make the claim in 2006. At first, a wave of new products with the slogan hit the shelves, and we bought them. Within five years, though, we put fewer \u201ctrans-fat free\u201d tubs in our carts and the popularity waned. \u201cI think it\u2019s relatively common in markets to have the initial response to be larger to the long-term response,\u201d says Caswell.\u201cNatural\u201d may transcend that post-law bump, however. As Caswell points out, \u201ctrans-fat free\u201d was new and surprising to a lot of shoppers when that 2006 regulation appeared. Plus, trans-fat was a single ingredient shoppers could focus on and avoid if they wanted to. \u201cNatural\u201d is a much vaguer claim with a broader halo effect, and products labeled as such are still on the upward climb. In 2013, foods with \u201cnatural\u201d on the label made up $40.7 billion in sales, and a 2016 Consumer Reports survey says we\u2019re even more likely to buy natural over organic.There\u2019s no guarantee that the FDA\u2019s forthcoming definition will encompass everything you want it to. Natural means nothing unless you know how each brand defines it, so today and going forward, it doesn\u2019t hurt to do some research. Decide what ingredients and treatment processes matter to you, and then read labels and look up the brands to see what they say about their methods. Who said you can\u2019t define your the contents of your pantry on your own terms?Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishOrganicGroceryShoppingTrendsRead MoreLifestyleThe Real Reason to Eat Organic Food May Have Nothing to Do With HealthBy Aaron Carroll, MDRecipes you want to make.
