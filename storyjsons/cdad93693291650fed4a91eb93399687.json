I tried it first by following the recipe exactly, and I\u2019d rate it a solid 4. I think it can be pushed up to a 5 by doing two things: nixing the cilantro and going for sliced green onions instead, and adding MSG at the end instead of salt. Once we put some MSG into the mix it was perfect, so I\u2019m definitely coming back to this one. KatPittsburgh, PA10/10/2021 I cook Chinese-ish usually once a week. Oyster sauce is a common ingredient in both Japanese and many Chinese dishes. It adds major umami to the stir fry. It is by no means an \"unusual\" sauce. This is a marvelous quick weeknight meal, especially during sweet corn season (aka summer).\nTracy MadisonMadison, WI9/16/2021I just finished eating it. Very good recipe, easy to make and very tasty.Eva eng9/14/2021I stopped at oyster sauce. When using an unusual sauce, how about another option? AnonymousSan Diego CA9/9/2021It wasn't bad, but I'm not sure I'd make this again.  I used TJs frozen roasted corn and added it quite near the end so it was very lightly cooked--that may have been part of the difference and it would have been better with fresh corn.  But Southern CA corn doesn't come near to Eastern Shore (MD) corn which was in my taste buds from a recent visit--so I opted for the easy frozen option.A SpiegelSanta Monica, CA9/9/2021This is super yummy. Only had a yellow onion but it was delish!  I also added snowpeas which were perfect.  Jen M.Los Angeles, CA9/1/2021Perfect and easy to adjust with the vege\u2019s on hand.  Loved the sauce and found it to be a perfect compliment to every combination we\u2019ve tried to date. And we\u2019ve tried quite a few.KimEdmonds , WA8/15/2021It's a keeper.  Super easy and actually used the TJ's roasted corn to save even more time.  If you like heat, add sliced jalapenos, or serrano's, Thai chili's... whatever you like.    This is one can turn into a wrap also with some fried or plain rice for easy lunch at work.CristinaBay Area - Cali8/9/2021Yep, this dish is fantastic.Karl BWoodbury, MN8/1/2021I made this a couple days ago after seeing the video and having read through the recipe in my magazine; it was delicious! The sweetness from the corn and the cooked red onion, the vinegary sauce (which I didn't expect to like as much as I did), and the juicy chicken...it all worked together really well. I did sub paprika for the Allepo, but it was still super flavorful. This is definitely going into the rotation of summertime meals. :)Amanda P.Atlanta, GA7/28/2021Followed the recipe to the letter, using very high quality Oyster sauce. While the texture of the chicken was very tender and juicy, the dish itself was underwhelming. I found the quantity of oyster sauce obliterated the delicate and sweet corn and made the dish rather salty and one note.  Oh well. LaFougasseNew York, NY7/22/2021After the first bite, I said \u201cChris, you\u2019ve done it again.\u201dSam RAtlanta, GA7/21/2021We enjoyed this very much. Simple and quick to make! I added some sugar snap peas to bulk up the veg and the color. A keeper of a stir-fry for summer.
