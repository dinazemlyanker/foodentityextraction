The vegetable-rich, spice-laden food at Anda Gyoza can alleviate some of the weight of trying to eat all of Tokyo. The four house-made flavors of gyoza, with ingredient combinations that are both expected and surprising, are the centerpiece to any meal here. There\u2019s a large menu of small dishes to round out the meal, and the alcohol selection, one of the city\u2019s most interesting, presents both curiosities and challenges.ORDER THE: gyoza, of course. You\u2019ll also want to try the rag\u0113 nikomi, a dish of stewed vegetables and pork that's one of the most flavorful vegetable preparations in the city, as well as the mapo tofu, a light but still intensely spiced reimagining of the Sichuan mainstay. The yasai rui, a dish of plain boiled vegetables, might seem like something to skip over, but after adding your own seasonings at the table, you\u2019ll understand why it\u2019s one of the most special items on the menu. When you\u2019re ready to finish up, order a filling bowl of ramen to carry you through the night.THE VIBE IS: Taiwan in the rainy season. The walls have been left worn in places and a single tiny radio sends out a steady roll of old tunes and warm voices. No matter what time of year it is, it always feels like you\u2019re waiting for a typhoon to pass by outside.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open from Wednesday to Monday from 11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. Closed on Tuesdays. The entire menu is available in English and limited English is spoken by the staff. Reservations are available for parties of three or four. Groups larger than four will find it difficult to eat here as there is only a single small table and a counter. Peak dinner times can have long wait times, so plan your visit accordingly. The nearest subway station is Yoyogi-uehara.By Kee Byung-keunExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
