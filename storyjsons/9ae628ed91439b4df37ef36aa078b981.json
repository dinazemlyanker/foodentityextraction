We\u2019d buy them in bulk from a local farm, then spend the entire summer trying to figure out what to do with them. I\u2019d snack on these sweet and juicy flat beans raw all the time, taking pleasure in their loud and satisfying crunch. Over the season, I quickly learned how to cook them every way imaginable: grilled, blanched, pickled, blistered. I don\u2019t cook in restaurants anymore, but in the thick of summer when all the colorful fresh beans start showing up at the farmers\u2019 market, I\u2019ll buy a bunch of these long green and yellow guys and figure out what to do with them later\u2014it never takes long to turn them into something totally delicious.So crunchy! So juicy!\nRomano beans are an Italian flat bean in the same family as garden variety string beans, which also counts fancy French haricots verts and yellow wax beans as siblings. They\u2019re broad and flat\u2014as if someone accidentally sat on a giant string bean\u2014with a juicy, sweet flavor and great crunch. They come in green, yellow, and purple, though the yellow and green kinds are more common. They\u2019re usually around four to six inches long, and can get much larger at the peak of the season.You can find Romano beans at the farmers\u2019 market or specialty markets during the summer, and once you get them home they\u2019ll keep well in the refrigerator for up to a week (I usually just keep them in the same plastic bag I used to buy them). You can eat these snappy beans raw, but I think they taste best when they\u2019re cooked, whether quickly blanched for crudit\u00e9s, charred on the grill and dressed with lemon juice and olive oil, or slow-braised in a tasty broth so they plump up and soak up all that flavor. You can use them in virtually any recipe that calls for snap beans or other similarly crunchy veg like sugar snap peas. Oh, what\u2019s that, you need more ideas?!
