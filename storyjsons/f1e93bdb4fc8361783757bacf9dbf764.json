Pat chop dry with paper towels and place on a plate. Season generously on both sides with salt and pepper, turning with tongs; set aside while you do your prep (it can sit at room temperature up to 1 hour, but prep won\u2019t take you that long).\u2192  Leaving meat on the counter freak you out? Read this.Step 2Shave 1 oz. Parmesan cheese with a vegetable peeler, then use your fingers to break into small shards. Cover with a damp paper towel (to prevent it from drying out).Step 3Using the bottom of a medium skillet, preferably cast iron, smash 3 Tbsp. hazelnuts, a few at a time, on a cutting board, breaking into bits.Step 4Peel 1 shallot, then finely chop.Step 5Separate leaves from 1 large or 2 small endive, trimming from the bottom as you work your way to the core. Place in a medium bowl, cover with damp paper towel, and chill until ready to use.Step 6Preheat skillet you used to smash hazelnuts over medium heat. Drizzle \u00bd tsp. honey over one side of pork chop, then drizzle with 1 Tbsp. oil. Rub with clean hands all over surface of chop, then turn and rub second side with same honey-oil mixture to evenly coat (this will help the pork caramelize as you cook it).Step 7Lay pork in skillet and cook, leaving it be, until first side is dark brown and caramelized all over, about 3 minutes. Turn and cook second side until browned, about 3 minutes longer. Turn pork chop upright and hold on its side with tongs to sear fat cap; cook about 2 minutes.Step 8Turn heat to low and cook chop another minute on both sides. Transfer to cutting board and insert an instant-read thermometer into middle of chop, about \u00bd\" from bone. It should register about 130\u00b0. If it\u2019s under, cook another minute or two, then let rest on cutting board 5\u201310 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.Step 9Add hazelnuts and 2 Tbsp. oil to skillet. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring with tongs, until hazelnuts turn golden, about 3 minutes.Step 10Add shallots; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until shallots are softened and browned and hazelnuts smell toasty, about 2 minutes.Step 11Stir in remaining 2 tsp. honey. Cut 1 lemon in half and squeeze juice from one half into skillet. Stir to combine, then remove from heat.Step 12Cut around core of 1 apple, removing flesh in 3 lobes. Thinly slice 2 of the 3 pieces, then snack on the remaining piece if you like.Step 13Remove bowl of endive from refrigerator and add apple and cheese; season with salt and pepper. Drizzle with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil, squeeze second lemon half over, and toss to coat.Step 14Cut bone away from chop and cut meat into \u00bd\"-thick slices. Place pork and bone on one side of a large plate and pour juices over; season with salt.Step 15Gently arrange salad next to chop. Spoon shallot-hazelnut mixture over salad and pork and serve.How would you rate Date Night Pork Chop?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (6)Back to TopTriangleThis is one of my honest-to-god favourite dishes. Honestly it's mostly because of the salad. The first time I made it I used just lettuce because I couldn't find endives and it was really nice, but with the bitterness it just marries so well. Yes hazelnuts are a splurge, but come on, it's date night. If it's this or a steak, I'd say this is better bang for your buck. And it makes you look so damn sophisticated.Saul KurzmanDevon1/30/2022This recipe is AMAZING and I don't know why it doesn't get more love.  The hazelnuts are a bit of a splurge, but they're so worth it, and you can just keep the leftovers in the freezer for next time!  The parmesan is perfection.  The shallot topping is out of this world (make sure you salt it enough so it really pops).  The salad is wonderfully crisp.  Altogether amazing.  Make this for your next date night, people!AnonymousNorthern VA4/14/2021Loved the hazelnut topping, really delicious with the meat and the salad. I'd have liked some more guidance on how to properly use the thermometer. Even though I got a correct read on the display, there were pieces of the meat that weren't cooked through near the bone.AnonymousColumbia, SC10/17/2019This is a winner. I used thick boneless pork chops, totaling 1 lb, and cooked a couple of minutes longer. Also almonds in place of expensive hazelnuts. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. The only element I didn't like was the parmesan. It was grainy. I might substitute goat gouda or something smoother for texture.
