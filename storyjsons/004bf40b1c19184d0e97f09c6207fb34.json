In fact, without him, I wouldn\u2019t even have known a path existed.By Julia KramerJuly 23, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailCourtesy Sundance SelectsFacebookTwitterEmailJonathan Gold, who passed away July 21 at age 57 of pancreatic cancer, is responsible for the two major misconceptions I\u2019ve had about food writing: 1) that all of it could possibly have been as good as his and 2) that all restaurants were created equal, no matter the chef, price point, or location.I didn\u2019t grow up wanting to be a food writer, for the simple reason that I didn\u2019t know \u201cfood writer\u201d was a thing one could grow up to be. Then in 2004, I shipped off to southern California for college, and I studied at a coffee shop that had copies of the LA Weekly lying around, and I read, for the first time, Jonathan Gold\u2019s annual list of the 99 Essential Los Angeles Restaurants (the number went up to 101 when he went back to the LA Times a few years ago).As someone who had never read any other food writing, I became convinced that writing about restaurants was the most interesting kind of writing that existed anywhere in the world. Which, it turns out, it\u2019s not. I later realized it\u2019s Jonathan Gold\u2014not food writing as a genre\u2014who is brilliant. (I guess I should write \"was\", but it just doesn\u2019t feel right.) By that point, though, I was already too deep in it.For four years of college, I read his reviews. And when, soon after graduation, I started writing my own, for the weekly mag Time Out Chicago, I began studying his. Whenever I was stuck on a lede, I would simply open a new tab and read a few of Gold\u2019s recent pieces.I turned most often to his Essential Restaurants lists, like this one from 2008. Chameau: \u201cAn argan-honey dip? Do you know where that argan seed has been?\u201d Langer\u2019s: \u201cIn the course of the half-block walk from the Alvarado Blue Line station to the old-line delicatessen Langer\u2019s, you will smell the food from a half-dozen Central American countries, pass within sight of Mexican street murals, and be offered the opportunity to buy fresh mangoes, counterfeit green cards and cut-rate cumbia compilations.\u201d M Cafe De Chaya: \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever wondered if people actually wear the $400 jeans you see advertised in Vogue, an hour at M Caf\u00e9 can be instructive, a merry parade of the snuggest styles and the most avant-garde finishes, worn by some of the most beautiful people on Earth.\u201dIn my head, there were never enough words to describe a meal: What was left after crispy and tangy and nuanced and delicate? But reading Gold was like being set free from my dark, depressing food-writing closet. It would remind me how expansive and evocative language could be. It would remind me that \u201cfood writing\u201d shouldn\u2019t sound like \u201cfood writing\u201d: It should sound like a real person. It would remind me that restaurant reviews aren\u2019t about knowing it all or, worse, pretending that you know it all; they\u2019re about writing something that people actually want to read.Having been educated in the unofficial school of Jonathan Gold, I couldn\u2019t understand the logic that practically all other media outlets besides the ones he wrote for seemed to abide by. Why were certain restaurants deemed of a caliber deserving \u201cstarred\u201d reviews while others were not? Why were \u201cbest of\u201d lists only of sit-down restaurants? I find it useful to think back to that time when I imagined that all food writing was like Jonathan Gold\u2019s. It\u2019s like a re-set button, a way to redirect when I realize I\u2019m heading in the wrong direction.A few years ago at Bon App\u00e9tit, I started a reading group, where we discussed our favorite pieces of writing and what we liked about them. I never had to hesitate when pulling pieces to share with the group. I always went straight to Gold\u2019s \u201cCounter Intelligence\u201d column, eager to share with my new colleagues what my old ones already knew: This man is the reason I become a food writer. And every time I read his work, I am reminded how much better of a job I could be doing at it.I know that I am both lucky and privileged: that I ended up at a college within the delivery range of the LA Weekly, that Gold wrote for the LA Weekly during that time, that my boyfriend had a car and would drive me from Claremont to Little Tokyo for ramen or Glendora for strawberry doughnuts or Koreatown for Oaxacan tlayudas. Jonathan Gold set me on the road that became my career. In fact, without him, I wouldn\u2019t even have known there was a road.Despite the immense influence that Gold\u2019s work has had over my life, I never felt I had anything to say to him. It didn\u2019t cross my mind to reach out to him, to ask him out for a meal\u2014in my mind, that would be like a kid at tennis camp calling up Serena Williams simply because they both swing rackets. I still feel that way today. And yet there\u2019s another part of me that wants to say something, to express my gratitude, over and over again, to him but also to no one in particular: Thank you, Jonathan Gold.See more: Jonathan Gold Was the Food Writer Who Made Us Love Food WritingRecipes you want to make.
