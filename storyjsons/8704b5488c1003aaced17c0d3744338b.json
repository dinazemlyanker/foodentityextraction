In our column We\u2019re Into It, we share our most important standbys and favorite new finds.When you tell people you\u2019re the executive editor of a food magazine, they often picture something slightly more glamorous than the reality of the gig. Instead, find me wearing my cozy Fines Herbes sweatshirt (from Atlanta designer Megan Huntz) for multiple days in a row, shaking my favorite hot sauce onto last-minute lunch toasts. These and the other products below\u2014the block-print napkins I keep strewn around my home and in at least three different tote bags, the ceramic spoon rest I gift to everyone, and the mugs I own in seven? eight? different colors\u2014are some of my tried-and-true favorite goods.Let\u2019s Toast!Everyone in my family owns this Panasonic FlashXpress toaster oven. It\u2019s the best kitchen appliance out there. I use mine to roast veggies, reheat leftovers, and even bake cakes.Courtesy of PanasonicPanasonic FlashXpress Toaster Oven$170 $146 at Amazon$176 at Michael'sGive It a RestNever thought I\u2019d call a spoon rest elegant, but here we are.

The light floral scent of this Gulab candle smells like rosewater: clean and not at all overpowering.Courtesy of KishmishGulab Red Rose Candle$30 at KishmishSpice Up Your LifeI like a heavy hot sauce, and many here in the U.S. are a little too light or limey for me. This warming West Indian Curry sauce is what I want to eat on just about anything.Courtesy of Shaquanda's Hot Pepper SauceShaquanda's West Indian Curry Hot Pepper Sauce$10 at Shaquanda Will Feed You$15 at AmazonAccessorize the TableHand-block-printed in Rajasthan, India, these colorful linen napkins are so pretty I keep ordering them as gifts\u2014and then deciding to keep them for myself.Courtesy of Sunday MondaySunday Monday Jaali Linen Napkins$32 at Sunday Monday (Set of 2)Morning RitualI\u2019m from the South, so I try to support brands across the region; a favorite is East Fork in Asheville, N.C. We\u2019ve written about their ceramic dinnerware, but the mugs are also perfect. I love them for their smooth heft and beautiful hues ranging from amaro to panna cotta.Courtesy of East Fork PotteryEast Fork Mug$38 at East Fork$38 at Bloomingdales'sExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingWere Into ItRecipes you want to make.
