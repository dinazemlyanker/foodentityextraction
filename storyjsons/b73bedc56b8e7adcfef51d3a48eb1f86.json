I care about you and wish you well on this wild journey through life. But I also do not understand you at all because I am the type of girl who would throw it all away for a crispy corner.I don\u2019t think I\u2019m overselling it: little delights like the spot where your baking project or casserole meets the side of the pan and goes crunchy and crisp, providing textural contrast to the rest of the dish. In my opinion, a baked ziti is only as good as the browned cheese along the side, and the caramelized sugar framing a snacking cake is without a doubt the best part. Therefore, because corner pieces have not one but two crispy sides to their name, they are twice as good as any edge, and absolutely worth fighting over. I\u2019m serious about maximizing both crispiness and corner-ness when tackling recipes like these at home, so I turn to the only cooking vessel for the job\u2014my straight-sided baking pan.I once thought my Pyrex collection covered all the bases, so I put off purchasing a straight-sided baking pan for years. The pretty glass dishes transitioned well from oven to tabletop, and could handle any cobbler or moussaka I threw at them. But with their rounded edges and sloped sides, these baking dishes can\u2019t achieve a true corner, instead creating gently curved slices that are thicker in the middle than they are at the edge. You not only get less of whatever you\u2019re scooping out of the dish by choosing a corner piece, you\u2019re liable to lose some of that magical crispiness as well, as it\u2019s inclined to stay stuck in the shallowest bit. For truly squared-off slices with no shortage of edge surface area, a more geometrically-minded pan is required. (And, yes, I know about the all-edges snake pan. No, I cannot bring myself to buy it. Imagine washing that thing! My love of crispy corners has a limit, and that limit is this very silly piece of cookware.)Enter the straight-sided baking pan. As the name suggests, it\u2019s a 9\u201dx13\u201d piece of aluminized steel cookware with precise, 90-degree corners; it looks like a piece of industrial equipment and cooks with that same level of exactness. With it I can cut a sheet cake into picture-perfect squares and build right-angled sandwiches on slices from a lofty slab of focaccia. The metal construction aids in even baking and is made to handle years of use. Since adding one to my cart in a fit of baking blues last winter, I\u2019ve pulled mine out constantly, most recently to make the Flip Side, a twist on the classic Hawaiian pizza that draws crowds at Philly\u2019s Down North. The quick-proofing dough fills the pan from corner to corner and bakes up into an ideal chewy base for barbecue sauce, caramelized pineapple, beef bacon, and pickled jalape\u00f1os. The frico-like cheesy edges were absolutely the first to go, but it was so good I didn\u2019t even mind eating a slice out of the center.Just buy one already:9 x 13 inch Non-Stick Baking Pan$22 at AmazonAnd make yourself a pizza pie:Hawaiian Pizza With Barbecue Sauce and Beef BaconFor anyone who has ever thought they hate Hawaiian pizza: This pie is for you.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingShoppingRecipes you want to make.
