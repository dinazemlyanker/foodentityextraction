Followed to a T with delicata, just added more salt at the end. AnonymousReno, NV10/15/2021Great recipe! I used acorn squash and used 1/2 cup oil as directed. Squash absorbed almost all oil and tasted great. I didn\u2019t use vinegar but still tasted great. Very aromatic. briggitazFlorida11/23/2018Lovely, luscious delicata!  I used 1/4 cup oil and that was plenty.  The herbal flavors were great. One problem with the recipe - if you use delicata and try to toss it, as instructed, it falls apart!  So don't toss. Also, it is soft and ready before (or if it ever) gets crisp.  One hour was plenty.  Warning - the garlic, upside down, sticks and makes a caramel-y mess that is difficult to get off the spoon, let alone the dish.AnonymousVermont9/21/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titAmericanDelicata SquashSquashVegetableAcorn SquashSageHerbs & SpicesFallWinterSideVegetarianVeganNut-FreeGluten-FreeDairy-FreeHealthyishRoastRecipes you want to make.
