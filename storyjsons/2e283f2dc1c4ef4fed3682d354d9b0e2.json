Added juice of one lemon to the parsley, red onion, and caper mixture. All I needed was a glass of chilled white wine to go with the fish.whogoncheckmeb00Lafayette, CA8/19/2020Absolutely delicious! This is definitely going in the regular rotation. The roasted peppers and garlic made the house smell amazing. Used Blue Moki fish as that's what my partner had caught - SO GOOD.PippaJKWellington, New Zealand11/26/2019I love this dish! In Italy I can get really tasty peppers marbled with red and green, and I add wild mint (mentuccia) to the chopped parsley and capers. It is delicious without hot pepperoncino for those who perfer non spicy. Great for a summer lunch on the terrace as it can be served slightly warm. Make sure your wine is chilled though!amiletta3885Rome4/6/2019Wonderful preparation -  there was swooning at my table.  Roasted yellow and orange peppers tasted like candy.  Doing them a couple hours early made final assembly easy. Cut the pepper flakes in half (always do - wife's preference) and used the water bath for the re onions.   Tossed in some halved grape tomatoes that were in use it or lose it condition.  Served with coconut jasmine rice.  Pretty to look at , better to eat!AnonymousAvondale AZ3/22/2018Loved it! Incredibly easy and a real crowd pleaser. Great for a week night dinner with friends. Boston, MA3/21/2018I made this a few days ago for two of us, so halved the recipe. I used fresh Pacific gray cod (1 inch thick fillet). We thought it was delicious and will definitely make it again. I think a really good olive oil and Spanish sherry vinegar are key. Slice the red onion garnish very very thinly. If the onion is very strong try soaking the sliced onion in ice water for 5 minutes and blot dry before using.AnonymousVictoria, BC, Canada3/5/2018Followed the recipe exactly and this was not for us. Unless you are a huge fan of roasted peppers on their own, there's not nearly enough fish to balance out the surplus of soupy peppers at the end. We tossed a huge pile of those in the compost. And the onion/parsley topping didn't add anything but an overpowering raw onion flavor. The dish wasn't awful per se but I would not make this as is. At the very least, reduce the peppers by at least half and make something else for the topping. On second thought, you're probably better off finding a different recipe for cod.
