Here\u2019s How I\u2019m Keeping His Legacy Alive\u201cHe wanted to ensure every child got a chance to eat.\u201dBy Valerie Castile, as told to Dawn DavisFebruary 12, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhotograph by Stephen Maturen/Getty ImagesFacebookTwitterEmailIn this week\u2019s Person of Interest, editor in chief Dawn Davis talks to Valerie Castile, the mother of Philando Castile\u2014a school nutrition supervisor who was killed by Minnesota police in 2016. Almost five years after his death, Valerie reflects on her son\u2019s life and talks about the Philando Castile Relief Foundation, which aims to reduce school lunch debt and help families affected by gun violence.My son Philando always loved food and community. Collard greens, macaroni, dressing, and steak. Steak! When he was little we had family potlucks and we\u2019d all bring something. I always made sure Philando had a steak. My brother\u2019s kids used to get mad, like, \u201cHold up, why ain\u2019t we getting steak? We got ribs and chicken.\u201d I was like, \u201cHe\u2019s a king, baby! He\u2019s a king.\u201dA year out of high school...Philando started working with St. Paul Public Schools as a nutrition assistant. The ladies there liked him because he was a hard worker; they offered him the supervisor\u2019s position many times before he actually took it\u2014he wanted to know how things were managed first. He was a nutrition supervisor at J.J. Hill Montessori School for two years before he was killed by police in 2016.Before his death...I had no idea about school lunch debt. [Editor\u2019s note: This occurs when students are unable to pay for school meals; in a 2019 study, 75 percent of U.S. school districts reported outstanding debt.] I didn\u2019t know the extent of it, families who owe hundreds of thousands of dollars. And I never knew my son was paying off these debts until after he was gone. It was considered a no-no, but he did it anyway. He didn\u2019t know if the kids were having nutritious meals at home, and what if those school meals are the only ones they got? He wanted to ensure they got a chance to eat.My family and I...started the Philando Castile Relief Foundation in my son\u2019s honor to reduce school lunch debt and help families that have lost loved ones to gun violence. We offer resources for grief counseling and housing. We donate to organizations like the Hallie Q. Brown Community Center in St. Paul\u2019s Rondo neighborhood. Because of COVID, they\u2019re meeting the needs of more families than they normally do and with even fewer donations. Recently, I was talking with one of the directors about a food drive they did with Philando\u2019s school when he was still alive. She told me about how he\u2019d pump the kids up to collect donations, clapping and singing songs with them. I\u2019d never heard that story before.My son was...a role model. He was a mentor. Somehow he remembered all the kids\u2019 names and all their allergies. Once, when he was still new at J.J. Hill, he noticed a new student sitting by himself in the school cafeteria. So Philando went over to him, asked him what his name was, and explained that he was new there as well. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come over here and sit with these guys?\u201d he said. He picked up the student\u2019s tray and took him over to a table where some other boys were sitting. And that\u2019s how this young man made his first friend.Explore Bon App\u00e9titPerson of InterestRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
