The sauce can also be stored to deploy on whatever you happen to be grilling throughout the week.Ingredients4\u20136 servings2Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil3garlic cloves, crushed6Tbsp. double-concentrated tomato paste\u00bdcup pure maple syrup\u00bccup soy sauce\u00bccup Worcestershire sauce2Tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar4tsp. Sriracha or other hot sauceVegetable oil (for grill)13\u00bd\u20134-lb. whole chicken, cut into 6\u20138 pieces, or whatever bone-in cut of chicken you feel like cookingKosher saltPreparationStep 1Heat olive oil in a small saucepan over medium until hot. Cook garlic, turning occasionally, until golden brown all over, 4\u20135 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly and scraping bottom of pot, until paste darkens, 3\u20134 minutes. Add maple syrup, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, and Sriracha. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer to let flavors meld, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Transfer about half of barbecue sauce to a heatproof bowl; reserve for serving.Step 2Prepare a grill for medium-high indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off); oil grates. Season chicken generously with salt. Grill chicken over direct heat, turning every minute, until browned on all sides, 5\u20136 minutes. Move chicken over indirect heat and continue to grill, keeping grill covered as much as possible and turning every 5 minutes or so, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 140\u00b0\u2013145\u00b0, 18\u201325 minutes depending on size. Begin basting with barbecue sauce, turning chicken occasionally, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 160\u00b0 for breast and 165\u00b0 for dark meat, about 10 minutes longer.Step 3Transfer chicken to a platter. Serve with reserved sauce alongside.Step 4Do Ahead: Barbecue sauce can be made 2 weeks ahead.

The only things I changed were to decrease the hot sauce to use just 2 tsp and seared the chicken at the end for a couple of minutes to get the pretty char marks like in the picture.  Janel C.Colorado4/9/2021Julian- to answer your ? It says to reserve half of sauce for serving. So people can just put extra sauce on their chicken. Making again today Anonymousnew jersey4/12/2020EXCELLENT, this is the best barbecued chicken recipe I have ever had! The bbq sauce is excellent and grilling the chicken in indirect heat was a very good idea to prevent the chicken from burning before it cooks through. nick016NYC7/23/2019This is a question: Are you supposed to put the other half of the barbecue sauce on the chicken before you grill it? Do you marinade the chicken in it, or do you really not use the barbecue sauce until after it is cooked? It looks really good and I want to try making it.Julian  FernaldSanta Cruz, CA7/22/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titChickenPoultryEasyMainDairy-FreeNut-FreeHealthyishGrillingFourth Of JulyMemorial DayLabor DayDinnerRecipes you want to make.
