An ingredient whose use sheds light on the complex racialized history of Southern cooking, potlikker was once valued only by diligent enslaved Africans who saved the nourishing broth for their families after cooking greens. Chef Carla Hall, for whom potlikker was an essential element of her childhood, switches up the order, making potlikker from scratch to use as an ultra-concentrated broth\u2014for Hall, that\u2019s often the first step in imbuing a dish with layers of deep, powerful flavor.For this untraditional plant-based potlikker, Hall turns to pantry staples like smoked paprika, red wine vinegar, and sun-dried tomato paste to bring umami. If you can\u2019t find sun-dried tomato paste, whole sun-dried tomatoes will work just fine\u2014simply drain (if needed) and finely chop before adding.Use this potlikker as a base for Hall\u2019s Braised Chicken Thighs With Olives and Herbs, her Brothy Pasta With Miso-Butter Turnips, or any dish that would benefit from a smoky tomato broth.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

The broth was smoky, spicy, and full flavored. I made the braised chicken recipe and the turnip and pasta recipe. Both dishes were easy and delicious. I highly recommend this recipe for easy and gourmet level weeknight meals.LeggySan Diego3/23/2022I'd give this recipe Five Stars - Absolutely Delicious. Followed it as written - it's a fabulous base with lots of possibilities!!!! \nJo-Anne Houston, TX3/5/2022Making this now and it smells wonderful.  I'm wondering though why I needed to peel the onions and garlic. Wouldn't a rough chop be OK since the solids will be discarded? I did add a whole jalepeno because we like the bit of fruity heat it gives instead of the dried pepper flakes. Going to use this in the Braised chicken thighs recipe in same article.ChickmaRio Rico AZ 2/28/2022Karla may call this Potlicker, but my mom threw a whole cut up chicken in and called it PaprikashOHSueOH2/27/2022Any suggestions how I can use this Potlikker?\nDiJBowLondon UK2/26/2022I hate to say this, but this recipe was completely underwhelming. Totally unnecessary -- the same ingredients (in adjusted quantities) could've been used in the related \"final\" chicken recipe, with at least 99% the same result. Advance prep of the potlikker was absolutely not worth the effort.\n\nI see no reason to prepare this particular potlikker in advance. That said, I'm looking forward to the same chef's fennel potlikker.StephenWAustin, TX2/23/2022Kind of surprised by the reviews so far...  This is essentially a vegetable broth that you are making as a base for other recipes.  You use a LOT of veggies, just like you'd use a lot of bones for bone broth.  Yes, 1 cup of garlic is correct (I used 2 1/2 heads, smashed, peeled then ran a knife through a couple of times to get that  1 cup).  Yes, 4 onions.  The picture shows the potlikker before it is strained through a fine mesh strainer, like instructed in the last step.  I made this first thing in the morning so flavors could meld in the fridge before making the accompanying pasta recipe (which was delicious).  It made more like 5 cups, instead of 4.  Perfect!  I had the quart I needed for the pasta and popped the last cup in the freezer to make the porkchops in the future.  My husband sat at the table and listed several other recipes we'd like to use this in while my 11 year old son gobbled up seconds.  Amazing!LBinTXTexas2/22/2022I am amazed by one cup of garlic. Is that right?Amanda RutledgeQuilcene WA2/20/2022Them there are solids, but still on stove cooking.  Got it.AnonymousMN2/20/2022Is one cup of garlic accurate?  Even for an Italian such as me, it sounds like a lot of garlic.Mary S. HittPearland, Texas2/20/2022I'm confused. The recipe says to \"discard solids\" - then what is in that photo?
