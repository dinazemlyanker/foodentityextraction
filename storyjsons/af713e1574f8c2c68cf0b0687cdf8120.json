You avoid all of the sputtering and splattering (and potential smelliness) of high heat stovetop searing, and cooking the fish gently means you have a greater margin of error\u2014and still takes less than half an hour. Fish cooked this way isn't going to take on any color, so the only way to really tell if it's done is by touching it; the flesh should flake easily under light pressure, and should look just barely opaque. And while that spiced chickpea-carrot mixture makes this dish a complete meal, you can cook your fish on top of just about any side dish you like and keep the method the same.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Time to do some prep! Peel 2 shallots. Cut in half lengthwise, then slice crosswise. Divide shallots between a medium bowl and a small bowl.Step 2Coarsely chop \u00bd cup raisins and transfer to medium bowl with shallots.Step 3Add 2 Tbsp. red wine vinegar and \u00bc tsp. salt to shallot mixture and toss gently with a spoon to combine. This marinated mixture is the beginning of a tangy, herby finishing sauce for the fish, but we're going to wait until the last second to add the mint leaves, otherwise they'll oxidize and go brown. Set both bowls aside.Step 4Peel 3 garlic cloves, then thinly slice.Step 5Using a spoon, peel 1\u00bd\" piece ginger, then finely chop. (We always like peeling ginger with a spoon, rather than a vegetable peeler\u2014all the better for maneuvering around those knobby bits.)Step 6Rinse 2 medium or 3 small carrots well. (You can peel them if the exteriors are really gnarly, but if not don't bother.) Slice as thinly as possibly into coins on a diagonal.Step 7Drain and rinse two 15-oz. cans chickpeas.Step 8Drizzle 3 Tbsp. olive oil in a medium cast-iron skillet and heat over medium. Add reserved shallots (not shallot-raisin mixture). Cook, stirring occasionally, until light golden in color, 3\u20135 minutes.Step 9Add garlic, ginger, 1 tsp. turmeric, and \u00bd tsp. crushed red pepper flakes and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute.Step 10Increase heat to medium-high and add chickpeas, carrots, 1 Tbsp. olive oil, and \u00bd tsp. salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until everything is combined and well coated and flavors have melded, 3\u20134 minutes. Remove pan from heat.Step 11Cut 1\u00bd lb. whitefish into even portions if needed so they will fit in your pan. Season fish on all sides with 1\u00bd tsp. salt. Nestle into chickpea mixture in pan and transfer to oven. Bake fish until flesh just begins to flake away easily with light pressure from a fork, looks very juicy, and is just barely opaque, 15\u201320 minutes. (This will vary greatly depending on how thick your fish is, so keep an eye on the fish and start to take a look at around 15 minutes.)Step 12Coarsely chop 1 cup mint and add to bowl with reserved shallot-raisin mixture. Add remaining 3 Tbsp. olive oil and toss to combine.Step 13Spoon mint salsa over fish. Divide among plates, or serve right from skillet.How would you rate Foolproof Fish With Spiced Chickpeas?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (13)Back to TopTriangleI love this recipe! My only tweak is to deglaze the pan with some white wine or champagne before placing the fish on top and popping it in the oven, this really melds the flavors of the chickpea base and keeps it from drying out.Elisabeth2/22/2022Love this recipe! I also add 3-4 generous handfuls of fresh arugula and 1/2c toasted hazelnuts to the chickpea mixture right before putting it in the oven; this seems to balance out the mint flavor and adds a little texture to the dish. KatieTacoma, WA2/10/2022I've made this a couple times and it's always good but next time I'm gonna make a couple tweaks.  I think less fish and chickpeas, more shallots, carrots and ginger and it would be perfect for my tastesPachDurham, NC11/18/2020YUM! This is so quick, easy, and healthy. Added some cavolo nero together with the chickpeas and carrots, which was delicious and an easy way to pack in some extra vitamins. Anonymous10/6/2020The mint is OVERPOWERING. I could see this recipe working if you used parsley or cilantro instead.. and less of it than 1 cup. Anonymous5/14/2020Super delicious! Don't worry about eyeballing things. I added extra shallots, garlic, and spices. Swapped for parsley because thats what I had on hand. Turned out amazing nonetheless! Try it out! I'm not a fish person and it still turned out perfect. Super excited because this one is certainly a keeper! \nAnonymousArlington Heights, IL4/24/2020Incredible. Made exactly as stated... we just had to cook in the oven for longer, but that likely has to do with our oven. Just perfectly balanced and amazing. Complete meal.AnonymousOntario, Canada8/10/2019Fantastic! So many flavors and they all just WORK. Didn\u2019t change a thing, and I\u2019d make it again and again. Raisin haters - take a chance on this one!AnonymousLos Angeles3/26/2019Cannot wait to make this again! Was super delicious. The salsa brought it all together. It was super simple and the components just plate themselves beautifully. AnonymousNew York3/10/2019So delicious!  Will definitely make this again.
