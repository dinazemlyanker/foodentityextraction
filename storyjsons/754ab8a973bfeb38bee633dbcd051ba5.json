Until college, she wasn't even an active member of her native Choctaw community. But today, as she leaves culinary school at 29, she is set to become a leader in a food movement spurred by a new generation of Indigenous chefs.The Choctaw now live in Oklahoma, but Reed was raised by a non-Indigenous family in Dallas. When she arrived at Evergreen State College in 2010, she enrolled in Native American Studies, before entering a masters program in tribal governance. She learned how government-run commodity food programs and food deserts on reservations cause rampant diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. She also learned about corn. \u201cThere were over eight thousand varieties of corn at the point of Contact [with Europeans], and even in 1900 there were still a thousand,\u201d she says. \u201cToday you can get maybe two or three in a regular grocery store. I talk about corn a lot. In Japanese cuisine, you can\u2019t not have rice. For Choctaw, corn is our staple in that way.\u201dHer interests quickly led her beyond the classroom. Her essay, \u201cFood Sovereignty Is Tribal Sovereignty\u201d (named for a speech by Native nutrition educator Valerie Segrest), exploded from a class project into an online forum for Indigenous cooks. But it was a story about Indigenous rights icon Winona Laduke that really transformed Reed from academic to food activist. Laduke\u2019s father challenged her academic background, telling her, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear about what you have to say until you can grow corn.\u201d Reed recalled, \u201cThat kind of sunk in for me, and I thought, \u2018I should stop this theorizing about all these things and actually get my hands dirty.\u2019\u201dReed enrolled in the Seattle Culinary Academy, though she wasn't drawn to professional cooking as just another job. Community service is the norm for Indigenous chefs. Reed worked with the Tulalip Health Clinic, a healthy eating education program for the Coast Salish community near Seattle, and with Yappalli in Oklahoma, a program in which community members walk sections of the Trail of Tears. Straight out of culinary school, Reed joined I-Collective, a group of Indigenous chefs and activists who organize pop-up dinners and seminars to educate mainstream media about Indigenous foods and rising cooks.The program highlights the work of young female cooks. Reed says she\u2019s thankful that well-established chefs like Mixteco chef and I-Collective cofounder Neftal\u00ed Dur\u00e1n and cofounder M. Karlos Baca (Tewa/Din\u00e9/Nuche), have given female cooks the spotlight because, even as women work alongside male chefs to heal Indigenous communities, they've had to fight for gender equality within the kitchen.Dur\u00e1n and Reed agree that female Indigenous cooks should be honored, both in modern kitchens and for their historic roles in feeding Native communities. Before Contact, Reed explains, women took the lead on tending the corn, squash, and sunflowers that sustained the community. When first Spanish then French explorers came through Choctaw land, it was women who dominated trading decisions, determining who got to share in their harvest. Female control of foodways in the Choctaw community gave women powerful, even deified status by extension. \u201cFor us, corn was sacred,\u201d Reed says. \u201cAnd women were the main providers of that sacred food.\u201dAfter colonizers stripped the Choctaw of their lands, traditional foods took on a magnified role in resistance, and women continued to feed their families Indigenous foods as a subtle act of defiance. Reed explains that by reframing Sunday church services by serving traditional meals or teaching children to forage for wild onion dinners, women ensured the survival of fragments of their pre-colonial traditions.As Brit Reed leaves school and grows into her role as a leader in the Indigenous food sphere, she inherits power and perspective from this history of strong Indigenous women. Back in college, she would spend summers cooking in Oklahoma, where her auntie would always remind her to \u201cembrace traditional women\u2019s roles,\u201d and that advice has become a source of both power and appreciation.\u201cGrandmas have been holding it down and making sure we still have these foods and this knowledge. We\u2019re just embracing who we are,\u201d Reed says. She has also taken Laduke\u2019s father\u2019s lesson to heart, getting her hands dirty. \u201cI recently took it upon myself for the first time to try my hand at gardening,\u201d she says. \u201cI tried to grow corn, and thankfully it grew pretty well.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishNative AmericanprofileRead MoreLifestyleThis Healthy Diet Has Stood the Test of TimeBy Sean ShermanRecipes you want to make.
