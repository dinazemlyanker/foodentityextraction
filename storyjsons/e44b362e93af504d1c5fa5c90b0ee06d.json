If you also like socializing but not transporting yourself, I have a trick: stockpile an easy, surprising array of snacks. \u201cI have persimmons\" is the most confident closing argument to any question about whose house to meet at.Below are an assortment of snacks that will establish and maintain your house's status as a default location. You\u2019re too reasonable to go overboard with a B\u00fbcheron always on deck, but you can still be competitive and unexpected. Almost everyone\u2019s got hummus and cheese and a half-jar of dusty salsa verde. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ve got:DatesDates strut that line between special treat and special occasion treat. So much gooey promise. They\u2019re like honey packets. And I really admire their boundaries. They\u2019re super melty, but they\u2019re self-contained. I\u2019ve never remembered to put out a dish for pits. I am reminding us both to do that!A very good thing to do with dates? Roast them!\u00a0\nAlex LauSliced Cucumbers with SaltI like to cut Persian cucumbers into quarter-inch thick slices and sprinkle salt over them. If this cucumber slice were an avant-chic beauty look, it would be the one with no makeup except a full face of glitter. It\u2019s simple, but it\u2019s got an opinion.OlivesI love olives, those meaty little agents of salt, more than anything. I think olives operate a little bit like shots of espresso or mezcal\u2014they shake up the internal fuzzes and distract you when the atmosphere feels a little dull. Also there\u2019s something a little fun and barbaric about dealing with a pit. Reminds you that you\u2019re a human with fallible teeth. If you feel like making them beautiful, grate lemon zest over the top.Or marinate your olives and accept your award for \u201chost of the year.\u201d\nPhoto by Heidi's Bridge, styling by Molly BazKimchi & AvocadoDrape (drape! have you ever even draped before?) some kimchi snaggles over slices of avocado. This isn\u2019t a neat snack, but if you\u2019re with a group that doesn\u2019t mind jabbing forks around a shared plate, it\u2019s potent and distracting. It\u2019s really nice with seltzer or light beer. I like Mother-in-Law\u2019s and my boo likes Farmhouse Culture. They do their jobs! And if you\u2019ve got full-fat Greek yogurt on hand, you can mix it with a bit of the kimchi juice for a sauce. If you\u2019ve got sour cream on hand, wow! I like you very much. That\u2019s going to be an even better.Candied GingerI\u2019m going to make an embarrassing claim, but I can\u2019t help myself: candied ginger is the champagne of chewable things. Candied ginger is a food so special-tasting, I truly thought you had to be a friend of my parents\u2019 having a holiday party in order to purchase them. But they are for sale! For all of us! They keep well for a very long time and linger like mini-celebrations.A SalamiA handsome and hearty stand-by. I like mediocre-plus Trader Joe\u2019s Chianti Red Wine Artisan Salami, but I don\u2019t like its name. You can put the whole cylinder on your smallest cutting board with a good, sharp little knife. The glimmer of danger is a fun ingredient to any party! (Prosciutto is another option, but one I\u2019ll never spell right on the first try.)If you can marinate an olive, you can marinate salami.\u00a0\nGood ChocolateSomething about sharing a bar of chocolate feels like the sincerest gesture of a child. But now that we\u2019re adults, the bars have sophisticated, almost shocking flavors like lime or bourbon. As a non-sweets person, I can also vouch for Raaka\u2019s Oat Milk unroasted dark chocolate bar.Pesto (+ Random Sturdy Cracker Vehicle)In a rare daring moment, I started making seaweed pesto (I throw some torn nori sheets in with the classic basil pesto set) and found it\u2019s even better as a dip than as a sauce. I keep it as a snack-fortification in the fridge. Zhoug is also great in this type of pinch.Garlic Aioli (+ Random Veggie)I went to Pilot, a new restaurant in downtown L.A., where you can order something called The Grand Aioli: a veritable trough of aioli for the table that they promise goes with everything, like a sleek leather status backpack. Well! I ended up believing them. You can keep garlic aioli (blended garlic + olive oil + lemon juice + store-bought mayo) for over a week and serve it with truly all the rando veggies loitering in the bottom drawer: kale, carrots, endives, celery, beets, whatever have you.See this glorious aioli? It was made with store-bought mayo.\u00a0\nPhoto by Laura Murray, Food Styling by Pearl JonesBlackberriesSometimes it\u2019s easy to find blackberries, sometimes all of the ones you knew have moved to Santa Monica, where they run an influential Instagram account from a white-speckled bowl on a jute placemat. I mix the berries with globs of goat cheese (found that idea in Niki Segnit\u2019s dizzying Flavor Thesaurus) and tears of basil. It\u2019s a messy snack, so I serve it in a medium bowl with little forks. If seasonally unavailable to you, a similar juicy blob option is\u2026Frozen GrapesThese are truly a perfect drop-them-in-a-bowl snack that looks decadent and breezy. I think I have a grape curse where I only buy them when people don\u2019t end up coming over\u2014grapes take up so much prime freezer real estate. Please let me know if this is universal.ClementinesBy clementines, I mean persimmons or kumquats, but I am trying to be reasonable about season and terrain. Clementines are an exquisite late-morning snack and they keep for so, so long. Their little skins are soft but effective. I think food that comes with its own little packaging is very proud about that. Also thanks for your patience as I refine my bragging about the fruit bounty in California, I always mean to be more subtle than just yelling, \u201cI HAVE PERSIMMONS FROM A MATURE TREE IN MY FRIEND\u2019S BACKYARD.\u201dMaggie Lange writes for magazines mainly about music, salty food, books, curly hair, and other things she loves.
