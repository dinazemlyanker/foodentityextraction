In the summer, I wander the city like an overheated turtle, carrying overdue library books, water bottles, and dangerously juicy peaches. So it\u2019s no surprise that I\u2019ve amassed a prodigious collection of tote bags, but they\u2019ve all been banished to one corner in my closet after this mesh carry-all came into my life.I first fell for June\u2019s smaller Mexicana bag last summer, but this year I\u2019m all about its roomier mesh totes. Made in partnership with an independent women\u2019s sewing cooperative in Ju\u00e1rez, the lightweight polyester tote is designed to hold up to 45 pounds\u2014and without the straps digging into your shoulders, I can confirm. Plus, there are two deep interior pockets to safely stash cash, keys, and other essentials that usually get trapped at the bottom of the bag.Sure, the breezy gold mesh fits right in with my summer moodboard (think: beige linen pants and mini bottles of Taj\u00edn), but I\u2019m most impressed by its durability. An incomplete summary of things I\u2019ve carried in this bag includes: three wine bottles plus a small watermelon for a picnic, groceries for a six-person dinner, a borderline irresponsible amount of farmers\u2019 market produce any given weekend.Best of all, the whole tote folds up into a card-deck-size roll. On days when I opt for a small purse (okay, it\u2019s really a fanny pack), I stash this bag in a spare pocket for any impromptu purchases. Now I can shop and schlep to my heart\u2019s content.Buy it: The Mesh, $20All products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
