Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.When I told my co-workers I was going to Amsterdam on vacation, they were a little bemused. \u201cWhat are you going to eat?\u201dI tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t going there for the food, but that didn\u2019t really compute. I get it: We\u2019re a bunch of weirdos who plan vacations around new restaurants and keep detailed maps of the best food in cities across the globe (I\u2019m looking at you, Andy B.). Amsterdam isn\u2019t exactly a city on every food person\u2019s lips.The truth is, this trip was more about my boyfriend's interests than mine. He works in nightlife policy (yes, that\u2019s a thing), and Amsterdam has some of the most creative and progressive nightlife in the world. So, yeah, you could call it research. And, to be honest, I was pretty excited to go to a city where I wouldn\u2019t feel pressured to plan every day around food. I still collected recommendations from friends and the Internet (thank you to everyone who DM-ed me!), but I never felt like I had to eat certain things in certain places so I could prove my food-person cred.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.And in the end: The food was great! Of course, it helps to go in without expectations (it also helps to sleep through breakfast most days\u2014one less chance to misstep). We fell into a nice groove once we discovered that most of the natural wine bars served delicious food: Glou Glou\u2019s cheeses and tinned fish with a glass of La Roche Buissi\u00e8re ros\u00e9, Bar Centraal\u2019s roasted radicchio with mol\u00e9, Cafe Binnevisser\u2019s celeriac fritters and light-as-air olive oil cake, and on the day we did make it to breakfast, 4850 proved that a natural wine bar could also turn out delicate cinnamon buns and decadent breakfast sandwiches in its picture-perfect space. And speaking of the vibes\u2014everywhere, big windows, tall ceilings, and perfect golden light.But perhaps the best thing I ate was at a place that was decidedly vibe-less, like imagine if your parents\u2019 den were the size of a warehouse on an industrial strip and it also happened to serve food. It was here at Pllek, after a long night of \u201cresearch,\u201d that a plate of buttery, peppery, roasted oyster mushrooms piled on top of brown bread with thick smears of aioli brought me back to life.Just as Amsterdam\u2019s nightlife is about more than stag parties, legal weed, and the red light district, its food scene is diverse and growing (not to mention you can get Oatly EVERYWHERE). I can\u2019t wait to go back in a few years and check in with the wine bars, the pizza scene, the Israeli food, and the coffee culture. In the meantime, let me know if you want my map.Until next week,Amanda Shapiro\nHealthyish EditorExplore Bon App\u00e9titessayHealthyishHealthyish NewsletterRead MoreLifestyleWhy I\u2019m Slowing DownBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
