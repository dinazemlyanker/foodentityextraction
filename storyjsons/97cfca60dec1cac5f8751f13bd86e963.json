Very tasty combo. Love the kale pesto. Will make again. MichaelLa Jolla 2/8/2022Replaced the parmesan with nutritional yeast and the butter with Miso and added a Tablespoon of lemon juice.... absolutely wonderful. This will be a regular at our house.\nDarren WilcoxWichita Kansas1/11/2022Great! But needs a little bit of acid, probably from lemon. Goes beautifully with a tin of chili tuna though! Tuscan kale is hard to find where I am so I used green kale and cooked it longer.AnonymousBoston1/3/2022Great Recipe.Anonymous1/3/2022This is a go-to recipe \u2014 tastes really comforting and wholesome. I\u2019ve made it in different ways, with different nuts, but I think the recipe as-is (+ one garlic clove) is really tasty. AnonymousMilwaukee, WI12/30/2021I love this recipe! Well actually I love my bastardized version of it \u2014 I didn\u2019t have pistachios so I used cashews, and I don\u2019t eat dairy so I substituted white miso paste for the butter and cheese. I\u2019m sure the cheesy version is better but fellow non-dairy losers like me can still enjoy! Kate is great Portland 8/27/2021Absolutely delicious! With such a flavorful sauce I couldn't tell I was eating kale and whole wheat pasta. I followed the recipe exactly, plus like other reviewers recommended, I added salt and lemon juice at the end. I served this pasta with salmon, and I will definitely make it again! AnonymousPhiladelphia, PA1/30/2021I\u2019ve made this recipe half a dozen times now and it\u2019s 10/10!  My meat loving husband likes it, my picky kids eat it, and it freezes beautifully.   It\u2019s adaptable to what ingredients you have on hand and very forgiving if you don\u2019t quite have the exact ingredients (using spinach or collards). I always use 1lb or regular pasta and tripling the recipe for the sauce, freezing the other half.  I find that ratio works well if your using 1lb of regular pasta instead of 12oz of whole wheat pasta.  It does taste better with basil (it\u2019s fine without) but do make sure your pistachios are raw!  It doesn\u2019t taste right if they have been roasted.  I also always need way more than 1/3 a cup of pasta water but again, that\u2019s super easy to eyeball.  Great job on this on BAJenny PChicago1/19/2021Delish!  Per the reviews, I added a generous pinch of salt and the juice of half a lemon and it was perfect.  I processed mine in the blender and it was perfectly smooth and beautifully green.  Definitely would make again.JennNew Orleans, LA1/12/2021The pesto needs salt before it goes into the pasta bowl. Has zero taste without. I agree that lemon juice is a must. The kale gives this pesto an earthy, heavy flavor that we didn\u2019t  love. We prefer basil or cilantro.  Jane11/6/2020my blender sucks, so I couldn't get it as smooth as it looks in the pics, but the flavor was spot on. Definitely recommend adding some lemon juiceAnonymousSouth Carolina8/3/2020Incredibly tasty!! My blender wasn't super strong so I had to add a lot of water to get it to liquify without chunks, but it ended up being really really good. Creamy and it didn't feel like raw kale at all. Could not really tasty any pistachio flavor, so will increase that next time, and the garlic was a little strong so will cut that down, but there will definitely be a next time!Ariana de SouzaCalifornia6/7/2020I made it after watching Chris\u2019 video last week, and it turned out great, though I left the clove of garlic out, which I believe would definitely have made the pesto more multiple-layered in flavour. And I personally find it a bit too creamy, will try control the amount of parm next time (yeah it\u2019s in my rotation now.willding96970Beijing, China6/1/2020Made this with my first harvest of balcony kale and oh my heavens is this delicious.  Made the recipe mostly as-is, but added a tad more garlic and forgot the butter (put it in the leftovers tho). I pureed in the ninja blender and got a beautifully smooth and creamy consistency with no kale chunkage.  Gave it a hit of balsamic the first go round, bit currently enjoying the leftovers straight up.  Quick, easy, and soooo delicious.  Has earned a spot in my rotation for sure. AnonymousKansas City5/20/2020LOVED this. I used spinach since I can\u2019t never find kale here at the grocery stores in Japan. But I loved it. Added a bit more Parmesan because I thought it needed a bit more saltiness. It comes out a beautiful green color and truly delicious. adamleclairOsaka, Japan 5/20/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titPastaKaleLeafy GreensVegetableSpaghettiPasta & NoodlesEasyWeeknight MealsMainVegetarianHealthyishDinnerRecipes you want to make.
