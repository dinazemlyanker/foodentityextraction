And had incredible wings on her visit to Michigan too...By Alex BeggsNovember 3, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Michelle & Chris GerardFacebookTwitterEmailEvery Friday morning, Bon App\u00e9tit senior staff writer Alex Beggs shares weekly highlights from the BA offices, from awesome new recipes to office drama to restaurant recs, with some weird (food!) stuff she saw on the internet thrown in. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Letter from DetroitWhere can I get some good bread around here? I asked Sister Pie\u2019s Lisa Ludwinski while I was in Detroit visiting family last week. Well, there\u2019s this guy, Maxwell Leonard, she told me, who doesn\u2019t sell bread from a secret bakery in his house in Hamtramck. She ran into Max at a bar once and bought some bread off of him. This is the kind of guy who might have some spare loaves in his trunk. Which is how I found myself walking up the steps to Max\u2019s house, where a black cat was snoozing on a chair on the porch, and a sign made from butcher paper hung on the door: \u201cThis is NOT a bakery.\u201dWant this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!It turns out Max, who is Elmore Leonard\u2019s grandson (!!!), is an obsessive. Brimming with nerdy passion. Definitely complying with the state\u2019s Cottage Law, which allows you sell non-hazardous food from your home (sorry, razor-spiked-candy confectioners, not you!). The kitchen was covered in flour. Max was covered in flour. A huge basket held seven loaves of the weekly bread: honey wheat. I bought one of those, two fresh English muffins, and a twisted pull-apart bread stuffed with his homemade sauerkraut. It was all fantastic. (Soon Max will be making the bread at Ochre Bakery, a new spot from the wonderfully caffeinated people who brought us Astro Coffee.)Photo by Alex BeggsElsewhere in Detroit, I got my fix of Jet\u2019s square pizza, where I learned you can order an entire squeeze bottle of ranch dressing for $3 instead of getting three sides (HOW ECONOMICAL!). I had pho from Que Huong three times. We feasted on caramel wings at Flowers of Vietnam, which was everything I\u2019d hoped it was after reading dream hampton\u2019s piece on it; and offal yakitori at Marrow, a new butcher shop-slash-restaurant with a killer wine list from owner Ping Ho. We stopped by Adachi sushi in Birmingham where we introduced my outlaws to fatty tuna, a revelation; we ordered big bowls of split pea soup at Russell Street Deli, where I nabbed a \u201cFAMOUS FOR SOUP\u201d shirt for soup\u2019s biggest fan, Christina Chaey. At Eastern Market, I picked up a mini sweet potato pie from sweet potatoes\u2019 biggest fans, Sweet Potato Sensations. A light and barely sweet Algerian pastry dipped in honey and sesame seeds from Warda Patisserie. Bright pink raw kibbeh at Al-Ameer. And how could I forget! We had even more secret food at Kung Food Market Studio, where chef Jon Kung made us pork and chive dumplings in milky white bone broth, rich in calcium from a pig\u2019s head that completely disintegrates after 48 hours. Delicious. (Order all kinds of goodies by Wednesday, waltz into his studio on Saturday, doggo not for sale.)Wow, that was a lot.For EVEN MORE, read our Detroit city guide here!Halloween costume of the weekLook at this amazing Halloween costume of BA\u2019s own Brad Leone and Claire Saffitz!!! Gahh!!! They even made Oreos!?! Big claps for Angela and Tim!Boom shakalakaIt all happened so fast. A BOOM, the sound of glass shattering, a small yelp, several gasps. \u201cWhat was that?!\u201d \u201cIs everyone okay?\u201d \u201c...Amiel?\u201d A glass bottle of what we thought was a chef\u2019s homemade soda turned out to be something fermented and it spontaneously exploded all over Amiel Stanek\u2019s desk and office carpet. Amanda Shapiro was on a Professional Sounding Phone Call and we heard her tell the person on the other line, \u201cSomething just exploded so everyone\u2019s freaking out.\u201d Thankfully, no one was harmed\u2014unlike the time shards of glass split Alex Delany\u2019s lip when someone sabered a bottle of Champagne (long story)\u2014so we carried on with our day.Overheard in the office\u201cGrunts, slumps, and a whole lot of dump cakes.\u201dUnnecessary food feud of the week\u201cBasically, it boils down to this: I\u2019m right and he\u2019s wrong.\u201d That\u2019s Adam Rapoport, defending his vision for a \u201cweeknight\u201d bolognese sauce, which was supposed to be a recipe collaboration with Andy Baraghani before a deep rift threatened to tear them apart. \u201cAdam keeps saying \u2018weeknight\u2019 bolognese, which isn't a thing,\u201d Carla Lalli Music told me, \u201cAnd Adam wants to pur\u00e9e the pancetta. Andy is not going to do that.\u201d Adam already has this broccoli bolognese recipe someone let him get away with\u2014isn\u2019t that enough? This guy is trying to fool TIME and time isn\u2019t having it. \u201cWe actually see eye-to-eye on most of the recipe,\u201d said Andy, \u201cThis is an ongoing dialogue. We\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d What a diplomat.
