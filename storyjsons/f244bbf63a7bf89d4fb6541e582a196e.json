Sign us up.By Alex BeggsDecember 3, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensFacebookTwitterEmailHey, don\u2019t just throw some stuff in there. I know you want to; I see that bag of leftover carrots in your hand. The Instant Pot has that appeal. And one of the best uses of the popular pressure cooker is making homemade stock in a fraction of the time as the stovetop stuff. Think 40 minutes instead of three hours, totally hands-off so you don\u2019t have to keep an eye on how much it\u2019s reducing. But getting the balance of flavors right is key, otherwise you end up with sweet carrot water, or cloudy celery juice. (If either of those sound good to you, though, just toss carrots and water into pot and press go!) So Carla Lalli Music developed two recipes, for Instant Pot chicken stock and vegetable stock, that make deeply flavored results. Here are some Instant Pot stock tips (low risk, big reward!) we picked up along the way:For Vegetable Stock, Brown Those Vegetables FirstTaking 6 minutes to brown the onions, celery, carrots, mushrooms, and garlic makes SUCH a tastier vegetable stock. And you can do it right in the Instant Pot using the saut\u00e9 function. We sipped it straight, it was so good. The mushrooms add a hearty deep woodsy flavor, plus umami, and we consider them non-negotiable. Without them, the carrots and celery really take over. Speaking of...Watch Your Carrot and Celery InputTwo of each, please. We tested with different ratios, and found that too many carrots can make a veg stock super sweet and overpowering. You need the celery to balance that sweetness and round everything out. These aromatics disappear into the stock and end up complementing what you\u2019re cooking later, whether it\u2019s risotto or soup or grains. That\u2019s why we skipped stronger veg like fennel or celery root. Too rowdy!Chicken stock, so nice and clear!\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensFor Chicken Stock, Simmer FirstAnother little step that makes a huge difference. Add all the ingredients, and then use the Instant Pot\u2019s saut\u00e9 function to simmer everything for a few minutes. A foam will form at the surface, and then you skim it off before going on your merry pressurizing way. Impurities (nice word for gross stuff, blood, protein deposits in bones) float to the surface when you simmer the stock, and skimming it all ensures a nice clear, non-cloudy stock.For Both Stocks, 40 Minutes Is the Magic NumberCarla, a famous cat lady, told me that pressure cooker time is like cat years\u2014it moves fast. We first tested the stock at 30 minutes and it was a little thin, while 40 minutes made a world of difference. The flavor deepened, the consistency was brothy but not thick, and the color was deep amber (veg) and a nice light brown (chicken). These are stocks that usually take two to three hours on stovetop, so any recipe around that time can be converted to Instant Pot stock in 40 minutes (like this turkey stock). Stocks that we wouldn\u2019t do in the IP: garlic broth (it\u2019s already only 40 min!), dashi (kombu gets bitter), and any other stock that\u2019s ready in under an hour.Get the recipes:Instant Pot Chicken StockYou will get as much richness and depth from this stock after 40 minutes under pressure as you would from 3 hours of simmering on the stovetop.View RecipeInstant Pot Vegetable StockBrowning the onions and using mushrooms gives this stock a deep golden brown color and plenty of structure and savory flavors.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titInstant PotBrothStockSoupRecipes you want to make.
