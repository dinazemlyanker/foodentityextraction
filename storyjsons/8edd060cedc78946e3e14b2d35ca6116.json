Don\u2019t be intimidated: It\u2019s a great for first timers, as well as mezcal experts.ORDER THE: many unique and obscure varieties of mezcal, straight up. They come served with sliced oranges dusted with chili and a bowl of addictively salty roasted pumpkin seeds, thank you very much. If you need to ease in with a cocktail first, go with one of the avocado ones, creamy and sweetened with a little blackberry.THE VIBE IS: at first, unassuming. The entrance is an unremarkable storefront, but follow the wall of glowing pink mezcal barrels and, inside, it\u2019s moody with a dimly lit bar and low, intimate tables set in every corner. Trust us, once you\u2019re there you won\u2019t want to leave.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Monday, 6 p.m. to midnight, Tuesday to Wednesday, 6 p.m. to 1 a.m., and Thursday to Saturday, 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. Closed Sunday.\u2014Molly BazWE ALSO LOVELas DuelistasLooking for freshly fermented agave sap?
