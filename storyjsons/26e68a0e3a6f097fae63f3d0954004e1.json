When something\u2019s so easy you don\u2019t need one. In It\u2019s That Simple, we talk you through the dishes and drinks we make with our eyes closed. Today, tofu feta.As a Russian I am constantly brining, pickling, or fermenting something. At my family\u2019s dacha on the outskirts of Moscow, much of our summer abundance from the garden is canned, pickled, frozen, or somehow preserved for the long winter ahead. But even in my current home in Queens, I have a whole section of the fridge dedicated to jars and containers where water, salt, and vinegar are working their magic on cabbage, green tomatoes, and even tofu. While tofu is not a traditional Russian ingredient, when it's brined it actually makes an excellent dairy-free stand-in for feta.As I began reducing dairy and animal protein in my diet for multiple reasons, I had trouble finding a store-bought replacement for brined cheeses like feta. The manufactured options were just not cutting it texture- and taste-wise. \u201cWhy is it so sweet?\u201d I often asked myself when going through different brands. That was before I realized I could get that crumbly, salty, tangy flavor by brining extra-firm tofu. Tofu acts like a sponge, and after it sops up a simple three-ingredient brine made from pantry staples, it delivers an almost identical flavor to traditional fetas.Here\u2019s how to make tofu feta:Drain and press 1 block firm or extra-firm tofu to get rid of excess water. Get out a clean jar or container with a lid (I like using 16-oz. wide-mouth mason jars). Tear 1\"\u20132\" chunks of the tofu and nestle them into the jar. Dissolve 1 Tbsp. kosher salt by whisking it with \u2153 cup white vinegar and \u00bd cup hot water. Slowly pour it into the jar, then seal, date, and shake it. Once the jar cools off, send it into the fridge overnight.The tofu feta will keep in the fridge for up to four weeks, if you don\u2019t eat it all first. One of my favorite ways to serve it is to marinate the chunks with olive oil, lemon zest and juice, oregano, and thyme on the countertop for about 15 minutes. Adorn with Halkidiki and Castelvetrano olives and enjoy on its own or with some toasted pita\u2014don\u2019t forget to mop up the marinade at the bottom of the bowl! You can also crumble it into your salads and wraps or make it the main star of a plant-forward sandwich. Or blitz it in a high-speed blender with some of the brine, olive oil, and herbs to make a creamy dip or spread.A delight for vegans and a surprise for omnivores, tofu feta (or tofeta, as I call it) will be a welcome addition to your easy pickling projects. In the meantime I\u2019ll be searching for my own jar among the crowded landscape of sauerkraut and pickled green tomatoes, then shamelessly eating it in the glow of the fridge.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimplecookingRecipes you want to make.
