Bagna cauda (the name translates to \u201chot bath\u201d) is a dish with humble roots, made by vineyard workers as a warming snack during colder months. Classically, it\u2019s served in an earthenware vessel over embers or an open flame, as with fondue.Though American versions of the dish sometimes include cream, chef Stefano Secchi of New York City\u2019s Rezd\u00f4ra keeps his version classic to Piedmont: nothing more than anchovies, olive oil, and garlic, paired with the season\u2019s snappiest raw vegetables. The dressing will separate and settle rather than form a cohesive emulsion, so use your best olive oil\u2014you\u2019ll taste it.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.
