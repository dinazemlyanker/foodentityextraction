No. Do we want them? After hearing chefs talk up the Kudu\u2014yes.By Julia BainbridgeMay 24, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailThe Kudu looks like it might come to life at any moment, swinging its two metal arms forward to sneak a sip of your ice-cold IPA. One arm protrudes north from either side of the fire pit, and they\u2019re what allow the Kudu\u2019s many attachments (a grill grate, a cast-iron skillet, even a rotisserie) to move both horizontally and vertically for mega heat control. Think ten-zone fire, not two.Do we need all of those bells and whistles on a grill? No. Do we want them? After hearing chefs talk up the Kudu\u2014yes.\u201cYou can do the same stuff on other grills, you can just do more at the same time on this one,\u201d says Cheetie Kumar, chef and owner of Garland in Raleigh, NC, but she uses the Kudu at home. \u201cYou can cook a ribeye until it\u2019s almost there, swing it around and let it rest, then get some corn going on the grates and maybe sear some peaches on the cast iron. Somebody\u2019s hopefully making a salad somewhere inside, and you\u2019ve got a whole meal.\u201d It\u2019s almost like having a kitchen range outdoors, she says.Courtesy of KuduAdam Evans, who will open a seafood-driven restaurant in Birmingham, AL, this summer, uses the Kudu to grill oysters. \u201cI like the flame to get around the shells so the edges of the oysters crisp slightly,\u201d he says. Then he can move them off the heat in one fell swoop, by simply pushing the grate on which they rest. \u201cIt\u2019s a quick process; you\u2019re really just poaching the oyster in its own liquid with a little bit of butter.\u201d Same with fish: Get it so close to the heat that the skin crisps up, but remove it from the heat source quickly to avoid overcooking the meat.Stebin Horne, a Macon, Georgia-based entrepreneur, designed this lid-less grill after spending time in South Africa, where he fell in love with braais, Afrikaans for good old-fashioned, pile-of-burning-wood-fueled cookouts. \u201cFrancis Mallmann builds massive fires and cooks tons of meat and vegetables that hang over the flame,\u201d he says. \u201cYou might as well be wearing a volcanic suit to do that!\u201d Horne says that South Africans make open-fire cooking home-friendly by keeping it contained and using a relatively small amount of fuel. \u201cIt\u2019s such a communal way of cooking, and more sophisticated than people realize. So I blended that with what I, as a Southerner, love about cast iron and made a functional piece of equipment.\u201d He launched his company last year, and already, chefs across the country are using it for events.Photo by Alex Lau\u201cIt\u2019s the only grill I use to make paella, which is tricky because you need to start out really hot and then move to a cooler area,\u201d says Katie Button, chef and owner of C\u00farate and Nightbell in Asheville, NC. \u201cYou can do that by timing your charcoal, but that\u2019s a lot more finicky. All you do with the Kudu is move the pan up. It\u2019s so simple.\u201dMost grills you buy\u2014think the classic Weber\u2014have round bottoms, so eventually, as the charcoal cooks, it all falls to the center of the basin. The Kudu has a flat bottom, so you have more hot surface area to work with. \u201cAnd its legs come off easily and none of its parts are so heavy that you can\u2019t carry it to your car and pop it in the trunk,\u201d Button adds. \u201cObviously, you can\u2019t do that with your Big Green Egg!\u201dBuy it: Kudu Open Fire Grill, $500 from KuduGrills.comOr make a multi-zone campfire with Brad instead:All products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
