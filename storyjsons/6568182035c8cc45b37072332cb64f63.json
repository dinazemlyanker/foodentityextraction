Our November issue is all about doing Thanksgiving your way.By Dawn DavisOctober 30, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Kelly Marshall, food styling by Susie Theodorou, prop styling by Sophie StrangioFacebookTwitterEmailOnce a month\u00a0Bon App\u00e9tit\u00a0editor in chief Dawn Davis shares what\u2019s on her mind by taking over our newsletter. You\u2019ll find recipes she\u2019s cooking, stories she\u2019s loving, where she\u2019s been eating, and more. It gets better: If you\u00a0sign up for our newsletter, you\u2019ll get this letter before everyone else.In college I lived the dream and took advantage of my university\u2019s study-abroad program. Atop a windy road in Florence, I settled into la dolce vita. It\u2019s nearly impossible not to sound clich\u00e9d when describing that first encounter with Italian life. Like so many before me, I loved the idea of eating pasta virtually every night, loved the experiential learning that involved bold Tuscan reds and bright proseccos\u2014to say nothing of that special indulgence, bistecca alla Fiorentina. Come Thanksgiving I was so happy that I didn\u2019t fret when roast duck instead of turkey graced the table. It didn\u2019t matter to me because there were still plenty of potatoes, veggies, rice (okay, risotto) and, of course, desserts.Not everyone shared my \u201cwhen in Rome\u201d attitude. Indeed, one classmate actually burst into tears when he realized there\u2019d be no turkey. I learned then there are three kinds of people when it comes to Thanksgiving. Those who ignore tradition to do their own thing\u2014and Alex Beggs\u2019s singularly moving piece on grief encourages anyone who\u2019s had a difficult year to do just that. Those who think it\u2019s sacrilege to have anything but turkey as the main attraction. And those, like myself, who\u2019d much rather fill their plate with sides.Luckily, the BA team is evenly split. Some love turkey and are wild about Kendra Vaculin\u2019s recipe for Sheet-Pan Turkey and Gravy. Others go big on the sides. We indulged our potato obsession this month, from Christina Chaey\u2019s Cacio e Pepe R\u00f6sti to Brad Leone\u2019s Garlic-Miso Butter Mashed Potatoes, which was inspired by his forthcoming cookbook, Field Notes for Food Adventure. We also have recipes for Bitter Greens With Cranberry Dressing, a subtly spicy Chorizo and Calabrian Chile Stuffing, and more. If you\u2019re still searching, check out our expansive\u00a0recipe archive.Speaking of Calabria, we have a look at Stanley Tucci\u2019s new book, Taste, and the scoop on how he celebrates Thanksgiving. Like Tucci, recipe developer Peter Som shares how his upbringing influences the big meal\u2014his mouthwatering menu draws from his Chinese heritage. As beautiful as they are tasty, these dishes are perfect for the holiday table or any table that\u2019s meant to impress.Because no Thanksgiving would be complete without desserts, we brought in esteemed baker and boss lady Cheryl Day. If anyone wants to know what they can bring to your table, send them this feature (sweet potato cake with chocolate ganache, anyone?). And unless you want to see someone break out in tears at your table, warn them if you\u2019re going to skip the turkey.Explore Bon App\u00e9titLetter From The EditorCultureThanksgivingTurkeyGravyRead MorerecipesThe 69 Best Thanksgiving RecipesGallery69 SlidesBy Nico AvallecookingBehold!
