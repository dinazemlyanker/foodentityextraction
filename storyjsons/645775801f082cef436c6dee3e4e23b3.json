This is pretty delicious on its own but would be an ideal teammate for a great grilled cheese sandwich.Ingredients6 servings\u00bccup extra-virgin olive oil2medium onions, thinly sliced1medium fennel bulb, thinly slicedKosher salt2tsp. smoked paprika1tsp. fennel seeds, lightly crushed\u00bctsp. cayenne pepper (optional)228-oz. cans whole peeled tomatoesFreshly ground black pepper3Tbsp. unsalted butter1tsp. (or more) sugarHeavy cream, Greek yogurt, or sour cream (for serving; optional)Flaky sea saltSpecial EquipmentAn Instant Pot or other electric pressure cookerPreparationStep 1Heat oil in Instant Pot on the Saut\u00e9 setting. Add onions and sliced fennel; season with a big pinch of kosher salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables start to soften and sweat, about 2 minutes. Add paprika, fennel seeds, and cayenne (if using) and stir to coat vegetables with spices. Set lid on pot askew and continue to cook, stirring occasionally and reducing heat if needed, until vegetables are very soft but have not taken on color, 10\u201312 minutes. Add tomatoes, crushing them with your hands as you go, then use 1 cup water to rinse out cans and add to pot; season with kosher salt and pepper. Seal lid and cook on high pressure for 12 minutes.Step 2Release pressure manually, then uncover and add butter and 1 tsp. sugar to soup. Using an immersion blender directly in pot, blend until smooth. (Alternatively, allow soup to cool slightly and pur\u00e9e in small batches in a blender.) Taste and season with kosher salt and pepper; if soup tastes tinny or acidic, add more sugar, as needed.Step 3Divide soup among bowls. Serve with a drizzle of cream or a dollop of yogurt or sour cream (if using). Season with sea salt.Step 4Do Ahead: Soup can be made 3 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill.How would you rate Instant Pot Tomato Soup?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (18)Back to TopTriangleLove this recipe! Made it last year, such a great pairing with a good grilled cheese. The fennel really gives this recipe the depth to elevate it subtly while keeping the flavor nostalgic. I used a blender in place of an immersion blender which I do not own. Simple recipe to make as well; I've made this multiple times last year and it was a hit; looking at it again this year because I'm thinking of making it again! Def going in my book as one of the reliable recipes. Tony PNew York, NY11/9/2021I love, love, love this recipe, and, even better, so does one of my teenage sons.  He requests it often.  I feel like the fennel and onion being sauteed together really give it a naturally sweet flavor and I haven't had anyone be able to recognize the fennel in it.  So I think non-fennel fans should give it a try if they are hesitating.  I follow the directions precisely and I prefer yellow onions. I use the immersion blender right in the instant pot and it really is a one-pot recipe.   I usually don't add anything creamy when serving but that's just personal preference.  I have served right away or made it ahead and both are good.  This week, I'm going to try freezing and see how it is after a week of being thawed and reheated.  Perfect tomato soup to go with grilled cheese in my opinion.Kate B-GSunnyvale, CA9/7/2021I don\u2019t have an instant pot so if I was just making it on top of the stove how would I adapt the cooking time ? Or could I use my crock pot ?AnonymousWinnipeg8/25/2021can this recipe be used in a slow cooker application?RoseveltWestlake, Ca11/29/2020I just made this delicious soup.  We're having it with grilled cheese on sourdough bread.  As a heads up to the person who melted the lid to the pot, right after I started using my Instant Pot, I bought a glass lid that is sold separately for those times you're not cooking under pressure.  I'll make this soup again and again.Sandy LevyNorth Carolina10/23/2020Absolutely amazing, made it for my family for iftar and they loved it. 10/10 would recommendAnonymous5/2/2020Added 3 grated carrots and 1 red bell pepper. Topped it with parmesan cheese. Delish! AnonymousMontreal, Canada5/1/2020I wasn't really a soup guy but made this for my sick fiance. That has now changed. I crushed a whole loaf of bread making grilled cheeses over the next 3 days. This will be a winter go-to. New Jersey12/2/2019You should NOT set the instant pot lid on pot askew while the vegetables continue to cook. The steam from the pot melted the plastic on the lid and now my instant pot is broken and unusable. So disappointing!AnonymousBoston11/24/2019New favorite tomato soup recipe! I especially appreciate that this soup isn't seasoned like a spaghetti sauce...I hate when tomato soups taste like thin marinara. THIS soup recipe is delicious, and I don't think it needed anything. Try this, you won't be disappointed! AnonymousColorado, Man11/11/2019I loved this!  Not a fan of smoked paprika so I did not use that. I  also did not use the cayenne pepper.  What I did add just before eating this was the Garlic Chile Oil that I made for another recipe from Bon Appetit.  It was an excellent touch.AnonymousHarwich, MA10/19/2019I am a fan of the roasted tomato/red pepper soup from Trader Joe\u2019s since it has more depth than Campbell\u2019s  (I usually add more cayenne and paprika to flavor it up a bit more) and almost didn\u2019t try this recipe bc my expectations were low after perusing the ingredients. I\u2019m really glad I did bc it\u2019s really really good. Ditto to a previous comment about adding roasted red peppers, or even roasted tomatoes\u2014a good modification. I used San Marzano but I think they do roasted whole tomatoes too. \n\nVolume-wise, I got two 32oz take-out containers out of it, plus one more serving when I was done \u2014 great for dinner tonight and freezing for later. AnonymousHouston3/29/2019Very good, but there's a strong smoked paprika and fennel flavor, so if you're looking to relive Campbells this isn't the soup for you.AnonymousCalifornia3/18/2019Can\u2019t we make it with pureed tomatoes?PicolabbAnkara, Turkey3/14/2019Making again today - love it.  I'm going to try adding some roasted red peppers for deeper flavor.
