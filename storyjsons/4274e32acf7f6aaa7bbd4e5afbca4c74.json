Pro tip: If you sign up for the Healthyish newsletter, you\u2019ll get the scoop before everyone else.Somehow, heat-wave season in New York started before July even arrived and I\u2019m currently experiencing the other kind of hot girl summer, the kind that prompts heat rash to bloom, uh, everywhere; even the inside of the fridge is sweating while it works overtime to stay cool.As a result the summer of beverages has arrived early this year, with a few upgrades that have made staying hydrated a lot more stylish. I recently bought this Hario V60 Cold Brew Maker, a tall and sleek pitcher that I can guarantee I will never use to make cold brew because I am that impatient. I do use it to make lots of roasted-barley iced tea by dropping an individual sachet of grains (like these ones from Ippodo) into water and letting it do its thing for a few hours.Every so often I\u2019ll go through a phase where coffee will send me into a state of frenzied anxiety, so in my current attempt to cut back, I\u2019ve been opting for gentler iced matcha lattes in the mornings. It\u2019s a treat to find a delicious version out in the world, but the ritual of preparing it at home is a pleasure in itself, and takes about as long to prepare as a cup of coffee. I make homemade almond milk (see my go-to method here) a couple of times a week and keep it in a big jar in the fridge. I follow the fantastic tea company Kettl\u2019s iced matcha latte method to the letter, then pour the finely frothed electric-green tea over a glass of almond milk and ice. (A drink this cute needs a cuter glass than the ones I own; I\u2019m hoping these ultra-durable, stackable glasses do the trick.)If it sounds like all I\u2019m doing these days is shopping online, it\u2019s because...I am. I recently wrote about moving into my own apartment and unsurprisingly, the single biggest upgrade to my life has been having a fridge I can stock as I please. The best thing I have in there: Not one but THREE reusable carbonator bottles for my beloved Aarke sparkling water maker. Between those and the four bottles of p\u00e9t-nat, my fridge is now 50 percent bubbles, which is the correct ratio of food to bubbles. Next on my shopping list: the perfect ice cube trays.Stay Cool in the Kitchen:Photo by Emma Fishman, Food Styling by Susie Theodorou, Prop Styling by Elizabeth JaimeIced Matcha LatteWatermelon and Snap Pea SaladHerby Avocado HummusBreakfast Salad with Smoked Trout and QuinoaAperol SlushyPeach Sorbet with Crushed BlackberriesExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishessayRecipes you want to make.
