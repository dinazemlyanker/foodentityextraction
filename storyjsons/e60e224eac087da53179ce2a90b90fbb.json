It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Whenever I make pesto for dinner, I end up at the kitchen sink afterwards. In theory, I\u2019m doing the dishes, but inevitably, I nab a green-slicked noodle or two from the serving bowl. And pretty soon, what was supposed to get packed up for leftovers has disappeared.I can\u2019t stop eating the stuff. At least during the month of August, when farmstand basil is abundant and affordable.Pesto genovese is only a handful of ingredients\u2014basil, parm, garlic, pine nuts, and olive oil. But how you combine them (processor, blender, or mortar and pestle), what the proportions are (kinda garlicky or really garlicky), and what the consistency is (flecks of basil or a silky pur\u00e9e) make all the difference.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!As a home cook who isn\u2019t big on formal recipes\u2014shhh...don\u2019t tell the Test Kitchen!\u2014I used to think that I could eyeball my way through the pesto process. But too often I would end up hitting it out of the park one day and scratching my head the next.So Friday night I decided to call up BA\u2019s Best Pesto recipe on my phone. I pulled the required amount of basil from our backyard garden, toasted the pine nuts just enough to release their nutty aroma, and microplaned the garlic, per Andy Baraghani\u2019s instructions.Photo by Adam RapoportI like my pesto to be more of an emulsified sauce than an herby, oily concoction, in the vein of salsa verde or chimichurri. So I plugged in my Vitamix and added the ingredients in the proper order (you can\u2019t just throw them all in there at once, apparently). Then, with the motor running, I drizzled in a steady stream of extra-virgin olive oil. Within a minute I had achieved fragrant, glossy perfection.Honestly, I can\u2019t recall making a better, more balanced, satisfying pesto. And when I mixed a big dollop of it with a splash of pasta water and then tossed in 16 ounces of al dente strozzapreti, well, I was in heaven. And to top it off, I served it with a tomato-watermelon salad, which proved the ideal on-plate complement.And when it finally came time to do the dishes, I just sat there. Why bother to get up when there\u2019s no pesto pasta left in the bowl?Get the recipe:BA\u2019s Best PestoThe key is to add the basil at the very end instead of blending everything all at once.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterPestoRead MorecookingThese Cold, Pesto-y Rice Noodles Are Incredibly ChillBy Alex DelanycookingWhite Pesto Is The Easiest Dinner You Will Make This WeekBy Emma WartzmancookingRed Pesto Pasta Is Here, and It\u2019s Full of Bright, Spicy, Umami FlavorBy Emma WartzmancookingThis Pesto Potato Salad Doesn't Know It's BeautifulBy Carey PolisRecipes you want to make.
