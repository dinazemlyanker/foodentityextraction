I am speaking directly to you, person googling \u201ccheap Christmas gift ideas.\u201d A budget-friendly holiday gift doesn\u2019t have to mean a peppermint bath bomb or novelty key chain or a scented candle (which, I would argue, is an extremely personal gift you should only present to someone with whom you share olfactory intimacy). This holiday season give your loved one the gift of not having to drop off that chenille scarf at the nearest Goodwill. I will help you! Below you\u2019ll find unique gift ideas for the food lovers on your shopping list, none of which is over 50 bucks. Several are even under $20. There\u2019s an elegant and minimalist olive oil carafe, a cookbook for the fungi-obsessed, and chili oils galore. Nothing here strike your fancy? There\u2019s always a waffle maker.Resin CoastersIconic Italian architect and designer Gaetano Pesce has works in the permanent collections of MoMA, the Pompidou Center, the Met, and\u2014soon\u2014the living room of your Uncle Marcos. These hand-poured resin coasters, which Pesce designed in the \u201990s and come in an array of colors, look like melted Jolly Ranchers.Resin Coasters$25 at Coming Soon New YorkSorelFull of warm spices like clove and ginger, this ruby-hued liqueur is a spin on sorrel, a Caribbean hibiscus drink with roots in West Africa. Founder Jackie Summers, who grew up steeped in the culinary traditions of his Bajan grandparents, is the first Black person to hold a distilling license post-prohibition, and this low-proof (15% ABV) labor of love has been years in the making. We think it\u2019s a perfect component for a wintry punch.Sorel Liqueur$40 at ReserveBarCedar Fish Trivet<places hot sushi bake right here>Cedar Fish Trivet$10 at JINENPura MachaSalsa machas are oil-based condiments that combine chiles with, often, nuts or seeds, and you can count on these three varieties from Masienda (we also love its masa) to add heat, depth, and texture to everything from eggs to tamales. The guajillo, cranberry, and hazelnut variety will liven up even the blandest holiday bird, while the revelatory arbol, nori, and sesame blend pulls inspiration from Japan.Pura Macha$18 at Masienda$18 at Weee!Supra Endura Beeswax Food WrapsFor the sustainably minded cook, these reusable food wraps made with organic cotton and beeswax can replace plastic wrap\u2014and they\u2019re pretty enough to gift to the person who loves their coffee pods and single-use water bottles without it feeling like a pointed comment.Supra Endura Beeswax Wraps$24 at Anthropologie$24 at Supra EnduraOodaalolly x Kasama Rum ChocolateOodaalolly\u2019s small batch chocolate, made with Filipino cacao, is infused with Kasama\u2019s small batch rum, which is distilled in the Philippines from local sugar cane. The trio\u2014an excellent stocking stuffer\u2014contains a 70% dark chocolate bar, a creamy and coconutty milk chocolate, and an actually good white chocolate studded with dried pineapple. Even better: A portion of proceeds go to a Manila-based orphanage and shelter.Oodaalolly x Kasama Rum Chocolate$24 at Kasama RumCell Phone Made Out of CheeseGather \u2019round, youths. Before the iPhone we played Snake on our Nokia bricks and coveted our best friends\u2019 Motorola Razrs and took big bites out of our flip phones made of cheese. The perfect gift for your BFF 4eva, this limited edition work of cheddar cheese art is completely edible.Flip Phone Made Out of Cheese$50 at WhispsAcid League Vinegar KitI\u2019m hard pressed to single out one of these four vinegars as the best of the gift set, but I will say that the spicy, vegetal Garden Heat variety punches up a Bloody Mary. If that\u2019s not holiday self-care, I\u2019m not sure what is.Big League Vinegar Kit$49 at Acid LeagueFly by Jing Sichuan Salsero SetFly by Jing\u2019s chili crisp is in such heavy rotation in my house that it rarely leaves the table\u2014but thanks to my salsero spoon, it looks like a purposeful part of my home decor. A baseball-size marble sphere serves as the handle for a wooden spoon. Pop the spoon in the jar and the orb acts like a lid for your chili crisp (or other shelf-stable condiment). Buy just the spoon or a set that comes with a jar of Fly by Jing for your little sister who never got that rock tumbler she always wanted.Fly by Jing Sichuan Salsero Set$45 at Fly By JingJunto Oil BottleYou can\u2019t very well keep that three-liter tin of Frantoia on your counter.

But grocery store varieties are loaded with sugar, salt, and additives that your pooch doesn\u2019t need. Big Spoon\u2019s Coconut Chia Wag Butter contains just three ingredients\u2014peanuts, chia seeds, and coconut\u2014that are full of healthy proteins and fatty acids without the filler.Coconut Chia Wag Butter$9 at HiveM\u1eb9\u2019s Way Chili SauceThis list contains not one but three different chili oils hailing from various countries, so for extra credit consider throwing them all in a gift basket with a dozen eggs. M\u1eb9\u2019s Way differs from the others in its use of fish sauce, which lends a deep umami note to the hot peppers and fried garlic. It\u2019s available in 8- and 16-oz jars.
