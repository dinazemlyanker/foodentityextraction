But nothing kills my seasonal fructose buzz faster than breaking down a five-pound watermelon. After a series of clumsy hacks, my counters and I end up stickier than a piece of bubblegum on hot asphalt. But not this year, my friends (*laughs maniacally while holding a cleaver*). The ingenious design behind Our Place\u2019s new Walnut Cutting Board is keeping me and my kitchen juice-free.Unlike regular, flat cutting boards, one side of this handsome board slopes down into a little juice trench that\u2019s been carved into the wood. Presumably you know how gravity works, so I won\u2019t belabor the point: As you slice the fruit, any liquid that\u2019s released trickles down the board and wells in the trench, which can hold over \u2154 of a cup. (The whole thing reminds me of a Slip \u2018N Slide with a kiddie pool at the end. Only the pool is full of juice and the children are watermelon seeds.) When I\u2019m done prepping, I drain the juice\u2014setting it aside for a salted watermelon margarita\u2014 wipe off the board, and flip it over to the flat side. At a sprawling 12\u201d x 17\u201d, it doubles as an ideal charcuterie platter for serving my fresh fruit spread with some hunks of cheese and requisite prosciutto coils.Photo by David Kitz/courtesy Our PlaceOur Place Walnut Cutting Board$95 at Our PlaceLet it be known that this cutting board weighs around 5.6 lbs, which is about the same as my friend Cat\u2019s grumpy Himalayan, or twenty-something sticks of butter. The takeaway here is that good things, in this case American black walnut wood, are hefty! As Test Kitchen director Chris Morocco once explained, wooden cutting boards (unlike plastic, which we reserve for raw meat prep) are great for repetitive tasks like chopping fruit, because the material is softer and easier on your knives. \u201cWood has a lot of give, so your knife edge can sink into it with minimal dulling, and the cuts \u2018heal\u2019 after your knife passes through,\u201d he said. Also, 5.6 lbs of wood won't go sliding around on you while you\u2019re wielding the aforementioned cleaver.However, in my experience, a wooden board is a little finickier to care for. After the first use, my new walnut cutting board was sort of fuzzy, like a giant kiwi fruit. Our Place founder Shiza Shahid assured me this was normal, and that the grains would settle in time and with proper care. Speaking of: after use, you\u2019ll need to hand wash the board with a non-abrasive sponge before towel- and then air-drying it. If it\u2019s fuzzy, like mine was, or when it feels dry, treat it with a food-grade mineral oil to prevent cracking and enhance the patina (a kind of gloss or soft sheen that comes with age). Our Place plans to release their own mineral oil soon; our team loves this Boos Block Mystery Oil.John Boos Mystery Butcher Block Oil$14 at AmazonLately I\u2019ve been using my Walnut Cutting Board to deploy hunks of watermelon for this zippy, umami-packed summer salad; dainty slices of kiwi for these Japanese Fruit Sandwiches; and fat papaya wedges to douse with lime juice. I simply can\u2019t get enough! What I can get enough of, though, is being covered in juice. Oh, look at that, we\u2019re back to the original point: If you love summer fruits but you\u2019re sick of the stick, buy this board.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make.
