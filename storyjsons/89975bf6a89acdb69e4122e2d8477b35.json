It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Cinderellie CinderellieAfter escaping to Northern Michigan for the tail end of August where I mostly read the Jack Reacher canon, I returned to a flood of food news. The biggest story is that there\u2019s an off-menu Cinderella Latte at Starbucks\u2014you just need to know how to order it. \u201cAccording to HappiestTeesOnEarth,\u201d Bustle reported, \u201cthe simplest way to get a Cinderella Latte is to order a Pumpkin Spice Latte and sub in White Chocolate Mocha Sauce for half the pumps of Pumpkin Sauce.\u201d So simple! You just need to hitch up your scooter to a flock of singing mice, have them pull you to the nearest Starbucks, find a fairy godmother barista to fulfill your wish, and fling your shoes at an unsuspecting cutie trying to get outta there with his Venti Americano unscathed. Not today, prince! Today I\u2019m getting the Cinderella Latte and there\u2019s no stopping me!!!Four things I cooked recentlyA delicious sour cherry pie that I made holes for the crust with the cherry pitter\u2019s plastic guard, which I thought was pretty clever until the Instagram comments started rolling in. 530, to be exact. \u201cTriggered!\u201d \u201cTrypophobia alert!!!\u201d \u201cThis terrifies me!\u201d \u201cThis pie ain\u2019t even cute\u201d \u201cI HATE THIS\u201d \u201cHide image.\u201d Oh I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re scared of FALLING INTO GOOEY SWEET CHERRY AND LIME GOO? Is that so scary?! I\u2019m fine to believe a small portion of the population has a fear of holes, maybe of the earth-opening-up variety, or Michigan potholes that swallow up Subarus. But I\u2019m NOT BUYING that my innocent little pie is doing it. Also, wahhhh!Danny KimThese corn and jalape\u00f1o fritters (double the recipe).Basically\u2019s incredibly easy corn salsa. There\u2019s a cool step where you mash the corn with a potato masher to release some juices and starches so it clings to each salty Tostito. Genius, Claire Saffitz!Healthyish\u2019s cauliflower rice pilaf. Not really a carb-avoiding type, but this sounded so good I had to make it\u2014and it was! You toast almonds in butter and then stir in cinnamon and red chile flakes to begin...and what else do you need to know, really.Want this letter before it hits the website?

Rock on, dad!This tomatoIs me at every party.Butter boyIs alive and well.Half-carafe kind of weekI finally made it to Sloane Crosley\u2019s favorite neighborhood restaurant, Sevilla, this week. Have you read her book, The Clasp? It\u2019s very good! You should! Anyway, at Sevilla, I had fantastic mussels in a spicy garlic-and-fish stock broth that I soaked up with bread, and a half-carafe of my favorite varietal, \u201chouse red.\u201d The carafe arrived and looked...pretty big. \u201cHow many glasses is this?\u201d I asked the waiter who was wearing a starched burgundy suit. \u201cAbout two,\u201d he replied. Reader, it was four. I\u2019ll be back!Explore more beloved neighborhood restaurants across the country here.Josh, you\u2019re rightI just want to mentionThat Carla Lalli Music (see a week of her dinner recipes here!) has been calling me \u201cAlexisss\u201d in a pitch-perfect impression of Catherine O'Hara as Moira in Schitt's Creek all week and I\u2019ve never been happier.Photography \u00a9 2019 by Tang & Nakimushi Peanuts.Why notSushi cats from the upcoming wonderfully kooky Land of the Rising Cat: Japan\u2019s Feline Fascination \u00a9 2019 by Manami Okazaki. Photography \u00a9 2019 by Tang & Nakimushi Peanuts. Published by Prestel.Unnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekIt may have been cut from a past article for reasons I can\u2019t disclose, but I\u2019m not an alcoholic seltzer gal. The mystery grain alcohol plus flavored water\u2014all for the sake of lower calories\u2014I can\u2019t support that kind of double lie. Also, I prefer tequila. However, it turns out a portion of the Bon App\u00e9tit staff, mostly a natural wine and craft beer drinking snobby bunch, had a White Claw Summer I didn\u2019t see coming. \u201cBlack raspberry tasted like a melted popsicle,\u201d noted Emily Schultz. Alex Delany had a Strong and Confidently Correct opinion: \u201cBlack cherry is the best flavor. But I\u2019ve only had them after having...a few other drinks,\u201d he hedged, \u201cSo do with that info what you will.\u201d I\u2019ll publish it! Rachel Karten was team black cherry. Christa Guerra noted that after two black cherries, you won\u2019t be able to tell what flavor any of them are. Jesse Sparks took a case to the beach with a friend: \u201cBlack cherry and grapefruit were easily the faves. All the others were hot trash.\u201d And before things went too far, Carla Lalli Music chimed in: \u201cI know we\u2019re in a safe place with no judgment, but this thread is really activating my maternal protective instincts and I feel like telling you all that just because your friends drink White Claw doesn\u2019t mean you have to, too. Just have a shot and then drink a seltzer, okay?\u201d Okay, Carla!Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
