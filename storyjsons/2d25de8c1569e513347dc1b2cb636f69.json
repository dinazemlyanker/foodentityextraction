It was delicious! I served it with farro and wilted baby kale. Will definitely be making this again!Louise MetcalfeCharlotte, NC1/3/2021Just made this recipe and I must say it was delicious. I made without sage so would love to redo to taste the difference. Either way, I will be adding this to my fave recipes list and making it again.
