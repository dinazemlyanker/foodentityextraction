If you want this in your inbox before it hits the site, sign up for our newsletter.Hey Basically readers,I hope you\u2019re hanging in there (that\u2019s my greeting to everyone these days, but I promise I mean it), and welcome to this new newsletter (new-sletter?) from me, Sarah Jampel, the editor of this nook of the internet.Okay, so why a newsletter from Basically now? Like many of you, I\u2019m finding myself in my two-person-absolute-max-capacity kitchen for more hours of the day than ever. It was always the place I spent the majority of my weekends, but now it has a magnetic pull all hours of all days. If I\u2019m not cooking, I\u2019m tidying. If I\u2019m not tidying, I\u2019m washing dishes. If I\u2019m not washing dishes, I\u2019m \u201cwandering through\u201d (that is, deliberately visiting) to \u201ccheck in\u201d on one of my projects\u2014yogurt setting, sourdough rising, kombucha fermenting, beans/cashews/lentils soaking\u2014and procrastinate answering emails.I\u2019ve griped about the size of the space and the quality of the appliances, but this week, I\u2019m just amazed and grateful for what it has produced. I\u2019m sure some of you are feeding so many more mouths in even tighter quarters. I applaud you. I bow to you!In this newsletter, I\u2019ll cover a range of topics large and small, in the hopes of providing you with ways to put your kitchen (however tiny), your ingredients, and your cascading hours to happy use.Want this letter before it hits the website?

If I had to lug a box of salt off the shelf every time I wanted to season something, I\u2019d never do it. With salt available at my fingertips, I\u2019m about 1,000 times more likely to reach for it, making it 1,000 times more likely the food will taste better. Put your salt (kosher, of course) in a plastic half-pint container or a little bowl\u2014you definitely don\u2019t need something special. Whatever the vessel, make sure it\u2019s wide enough that your thumb and first two fingers can grab big pinches.My New Favorite Way to Eat...Sweet PotatoesNo kitchen of mine has ever been too crowded for a pile of nature\u2019s sweet orange (or white or purple) starches. They last forever and I never get tired of finding new ways to eat them. This week, I roasted a bunch whole, then leaned on them for nearly every lunch. For this one in particular, I cut them in half, then seared their cut sides in butter until golden-brown. I dressed them with lime juice, parmesan (weird, I know), Greek yogurt, and dill, the only herb I had.Photo by Sarah Jampel\u00a0Moment Of Appreciation For...A Good Old-Fashioned Card GameWhenever I need to anchor myself to a room other than the kitchen, my husband gets out the deck of cards, and we dorks play a round or two of 66 (a.k.a. Paderb\u00f6rnern), a two-person game that\u2019s popular in Eastern Europe. It\u2019s distracting, competitive, strategic, time-consuming, and screen-free (except that we taught ourselves to play by watching YouTube videos). When we\u2019re bored of that, we break out Bananagrams.This Week I\u2019m Going To\u2026Prepare for Passover by covering matzo in copious amounts of butter, sugar, and melted chocolateParticipate in a quarantine recipe exchange, where I\u2019ll email a friend-of-a-friend a recipe and magically receive 36 in return (email me at eatbasically@gmail.com and I\u2019ll loop you in. Or start your own Google doc cookbook)Peel garlic while I\u2019m Zooming for easy access later (thanks for the idea, Christina Chaey)Buy a mask from a company that will donate a mask to healthcare workers, like GIR, Frogmouth, or Hedley and BennettMake scrambled eggs for dinnerSee you here next week!Random P.S.In my house, we\u2019ve been fiercely debating the question of whether banana bread is distinct from banana cake? My husband is convinced we\u2019ve been eating banana cake under the guise of \u201cbread\u201d all along, but I think that banana cake is airier, with a tight, springy crumb, and typically frosted.
