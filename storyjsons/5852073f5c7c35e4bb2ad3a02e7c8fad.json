As a kid, I swapped Jolly Ranchers, Snickers, and the rest of my trick o\u2019 treat spoils for all the Reese\u2019s in my sister\u2019s pillowcase. Now that I\u2019m an adult who can buy my own damn candy, I have a new peanut butter-laced fixation: Lake Champlain\u2019s Peanut Five Star Bars.If you happily subsist on daily PB&J sandwiches and inhale jars of nut butter by the spoonful, you need this bar in your life. The magic lies in its ratio of peanut butter to chocolate, which is absurdly high in favor of gooey peanut butter\u2014about 75 percent! While this guess is wholly unscientific, it\u2019s been tested over many late-night snacks...and I can say with confidence, it feels right.) The nut butter is studded with crispy rice and salted peanuts, creating contrasting textures to ward off that sticky mouth feel that comes from eating too much nut butter. (Don\u2019t lie, you know the feeling.) And while I usually prefer dark chocolate, the sweet milk chocolate coating here ties each component together.To state the obvious, this is one rich candy bar. It\u2019s reminiscent of the thick slabs of peanut butter fudge sold at charmingly kitschy roadside attractions, and that\u2019s exactly what I want anytime I need something sweet.I don\u2019t even pretend to have willpower when I have one of these bars in my clutches, which is why I stuff them in my freezer to stretch out the experience as long as possible. Instead of chomping down with reckless abandon, I slice frozen bars into delicate shards, then slowly, luxuriously pop each piece into my mouth like a Roman emperor. Or at least, things start out that way. Inevitably, my nut butter-addled brain short-circuits, and the last few slices disappear in a blur of chocolate-smeared fingers. It\u2019s messy, peanut-buttery bliss.Buy it: Lake Champlain Peanut Five Star Bar, $4 at Lake Champlain ChocolatesAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
