Six months of testing. Too many hours on YouTube. That\u2019s how Andy Kadin taught himself to make Japanese milk bread for chefs Akira Akuto and Nick Montgomery who were preparing to open their restaurant, Konbi, in Los Angeles. A year and a half before the tiny counter serving Japanese convenience store\u2013inspired sandwiches and pristine pastries became one of the hottest restaurants in the country, Akuto and Montgomery commissioned the Bub and Grandma\u2019s bakery owner to create one of the most important components for their signature sandwiches. They figured it would take that long to get it right.The result is the quintessence of the style: A perfectly rectangular loaf with barely a hint of crust cut into thick, even squares. It has a milky-sweet flavor and a feathery soft texture that tears into wispy strands and melts in your mouth. It has none of the naturally leavened holes or sourdough tang that\u2019s prized these days among bread nerds. It\u2019s the only enriched dough (one that includes eggs, butter, and sugar) Kadin makes at Bub and Grandma\u2019s, and Konbi is the sole recipient of the loaves baked off each morning.One of the coveted Konbi loaves.\nCourtesy of Andy Kadin/KonbiAnd while food writers (guilty!) fell over themselves to taste and Instagram all the sandos (yolky egg salad, perfectly layered katsu) at Konbi when it opened last October, Kadin experienced his own kind of fervor as well. \u201cMany, many chefs and customers asked us to make them milk bread,\u201d Kadin tells me. \u201cNow I get an email every other week.\u201dKadin isn\u2019t the only baker fielding these types of requests. In Seattle, Alessandra Gordon, the breadmaker for her family\u2019s jam stand, Ayako & Family, has been hit up by local chefs, like Rachel Yang of Joule, for one-off milk bread orders. (She also helped us with this recipe we published in March.) At P\u00e2tisserie Fouet in New York City, pastry chef Yoshie Shirakawa sells out all 36 loaves they bake each weekend by the afternoon. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even think of putting whole loaves on the menu until we started getting a lot of requests,\u201d Shirakawa says. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep up our supply.\u201dP\u00e2tisserie Fouet's milk bread, all sliced and ready to go.\nPhoto by Hisanori HatoriAnd to meet that demand, milk bread is suddenly everywhere. It\u2019s at modern Japanese restaurants like Konbi and Pagu in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It\u2019s at not-at-all Japanese restaurants like Carpenters Hall in Austin and Kindred in Davidson, North Carolina. It\u2019s at tiny take-out counters like David Chang\u2019s Peach Mart in New York City. It\u2019s at bakeries like Breadbelly in San Francisco and P\u00e2tisserie Fouet. It\u2019s at high-end, small plates restaurants like The Progress, also in San Francisco, where pastry chef Nicole Krasinski shapes the dough into hot dog buns. It\u2019s at a slew of trendy openings like nearby Stonemill Matcha, where pastry chef Mikiko Yui makes her own milk bread because chefs like Krasinski got their colleagues obsessing over it too.To put it in restaurant trend terms, milk bread is having its \u201ccacio e pepe\u201d moment. It\u2019s now become a requisite on cool restaurant menus, and it\u2019s not going anywhere. In fact, its presence is growing.Legend has it that milk bread may have been actually invented by British baker Robert Clarke, who opened Yokohama Bakery in Japan back in 1862. At least that\u2019s what Annie Sheng, an anthropologist studying Asian bread at Cornell University, has pieced together in her own research. But even for her, it\u2019s hard to say when milk bread, known as shokupan (\u201cfood bread\u201d) in Japan, officially came onto the scene. \u201cShokupan is a general term for a loaf you cut and slice and toast into sandwiches,\u201d Sheng tells me. That makes it hard to tie down in an easy definition. It\u2019s also why there\u2019s variability among recipes.Some milk bread is made with yudane, a sandy flour-and-water paste that gives the loaf the right bounce and a longer shelf life. Others call for tangzhong, the Chinese equivalent, made of a warmed milk-and-flour slurry. Some are just a mix of flour, milk or water, sugar, salt, active dry yeast, and on occasion butter. Some loaves are shaped like a flat-topped Pullman, known as kaku-shoku in Japan, or rippled with rounded ridges in the Yamagata style. Others are kind of twisted like a corkscrew before baked. All this is to say, the method and shape may be different, but that combination of flour, some kind of liquid, sugar, salt, and yeast all lead to one thing: cottony shokupan.The closest thing to milk bread in the U.S. is bland, shaggy-textured supermarket white bread we ate as kids. It\u2019s not a far stretch. They both have soft and pillowy insides, very little crust, and an extremely mild but crowd-pleasing flavor. That said, they have one key difference: \u201cTypically shokupan is far more enriched, meaning it contains more fat,\u201d says Larissa Zhou, a food scientist who worked on Modernist Bread. In her research for the groundbreaking, five-volume, 2,500-page book, she found that shokupan had nearly seven times the fat\u2014coming from either butter or milk or both\u2014as regular white bread.The Yamagata style at Stonemill Matcha.\nPhoto by LoriLynne RiceGenerally carbs in loaf-form arrived in Japan with the Dutch and Portuguese in the 16th century. Most Japanese households didn\u2019t have ovens, so bread never stuck as an essential food. Instead, according to Eric Rath, a history professor at the University of Kansas and an author of a number of Japanese food history books, the Japanese considered bread a snack, which lead to a preference for sweeter bread, like the 1874 invention of adzuki bean\u2013stuffed anpan.Around World War II, we start seeing bread as a staple in Japan, mainly because rice became scarce and expensive just as American supplies of wheat and yeast were coming in. \u201cWhen rice was rationed during wartime, there was an emphasis on making bread,\u201d Rath explains to me. \u201cThere were even recipes for patriotic breads, made with seaweed and vegetables.\u201d By the 1950s, bread took off as rice consumption went down by 50 percent and started replacing the usual rice served alongside soup or, say, a fried pork cutlet. But it wasn\u2019t until the late 1970s that konbini, 24-hour Japanese convenience stores, started popping up and selling sandos as we know them today.Rath and Sheng aren\u2019t exactly sure when milk bread reached the States, but Sheng theorizes that it could have come with the birth of Japanese grocery stores like Mitsuwa in the late 1990s, followed by the arrival of Asian bakery chains like South Korea\u2019s Paris Baguette and Taiwan\u2019s 85 Degrees C in the early 2000s. With these places came their mass-produced versions of the flat, square milk bread that stayed perennially soft from dough conditioners and shortening. This was the milk bread I, along with many chefs and bakers I spoke to, grew up with. But it\u2019s nothing like the kind of milk bread appearing on menus around the country right now.Pagu is beginning to experiment with local grains for its milk bread.\nCourtesy of PaguBefore the recent boom, milk bread wasn\u2019t taken all that seriously in the U.S.\u2014at least not in the same way that bakers have obsessed over, say, sourdough. That\u2019s probably due in part to our limited exposure to it: All we\u2019ve known for decades is the industrialized, additive-enhanced sandwich bread. Made with so many extras, it\u2019s not particularly challenging or exciting to make\u2014and in turn, not considered an opportunity to flaunt your skills as a baker. But it might also be because European-style baked goods, especially French, have long been considered the pinnacle of pastry art both for Americans (ever heard of bread bros?) as well as bakers abroad in Asia. \u201cMy mom was telling me that milk bread is not a bread. That\u2019s what the French said in a documentary she was watching,\u201d Yui remembers. \u201cI think for certain people this bread isn\u2019t considered an artisanal bread.\u201dBut now bakers, especially Asian and Asian-American ones, are reclaiming boring old sandwich bread and making it artisanal. Which isn\u2019t as easy as everyone thought. Making a perfectly fluffy loaf requires rigorous R&D, patience, and passion. At Ayako & Family, Gordon spent months testing doughs with a Japanese pastry\u2013trained friend to develop a recipe for milk bread that didn\u2019t include the typical additives (dough conditioners, vital wheat gluten) used in industrial baking. Chef Tracy Chang is working with Harvard undergrads to figure out how to get more local and freshly milled grains into her milk bread at Pagu. At Breadbelly, chefs Katherine Campecino, Clement Hsu, and James Wong relied on their collective experience as pastry cooks at Atelier Crenn to reverse-engineer the milk bread they tried all over San Francisco\u2014but without the dough extenders or highly refined white flour they saw others using. They ended up sourcing their flour from a farm in Utah through Central Milling in Petaluma, California. It took a few months tinkering with the tangzhong and the shaping technique until they finally created a milk bread that not only fulfilled their initial craving but was also something they could feel proud of.It took a lot of R&D to get to these perfect hills of dough for the Bread Belly team.\nCourtesy of Breadbelly\u201cThere are a lot of Asian-American chefs who came through high-end kitchens and are now doing their own thing, tracing back to what they grew up with and finding ways to re-create those memories and flavors, but with the resources and techniques to make it even more delicious,\u201d Wong explains.And this new generation of chefs and their current obsession with milk bread points to something we haven\u2019t really seen before: the glorification of an Asian bread tradition. Not noodles, not dumplings\u2014but fluffy, everyday milk bread.\u201cWhy are people making milk bread now?\u201d Hsu poses. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because there are more Asian-American chefs. Or maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s the new American bread.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsTrendsBreadRead MoreMilk BreadcookingA Fruit Sando Is a Dessert Sandwich Filled with Joy and Whipped CreamBy Elyse InaminerestaurantsBreakfast at Davelle Is the Best Way to Start a Day in New YorkBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
