What?!By Nikhita MahtaniDecember 19, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie CraigFacebookTwitterEmailI\u2019ve always been told I have really great genes\u2014but only by people who\u2019ve met my parents. They look like they\u2019re 30, while I, on the other hand, have had a forehead wrinkle I\u2019ve affectionately called \u201cfrowny\u201d since I was 21. The youthfulness I do have is the kind most people hope to leave behind: acne, dark spots, and uneven skin tone.To compensate, I\u2019ve developed a fairly complicated skincare routine that includes regular facials as well as tons of kale and supplements\u2014and while they definitely make a difference, I still break out every time I take a flight, and my dark spots are more noticeable when I don\u2019t get enough sleep (which happens often). But recently I was scrolling CAP Beauty\u2019s grocery section in search of some more adaptogens to help manage my high stress levels, and I spotted something called dried bilberry powder. I love blueberries for their flavor and health benefits, and this product promised a similar taste and more antioxidants per tablespoon. (Hey, it was winter: I needed all the immunity-boosting power I could get!)I know what you\u2019re thinking: Yet another supplement promising to give you that elusive \u201cglow.\u201d But that\u2019s not what bilberry powder is about. Consisting of pure dried and powdered bilberries, the powder from Nordic Nordic delivers 300 berries per tablespoon. That\u2019s so many berries! Think of it as antioxidants on steroids, protecting the skin from sun damage, curing dark spots, boosting collagen production, and aiding digestion, helping to fight the buildup of toxins in the body.Co-founder Reeta Piirala-Skoglund, who launched the brand after moving to the U.S. from Finland, explains, \u201cI actually have very bad eczema, and this has been one of the best ways to control that in a natural way. Eating berries is such a big part of Finnish culture, and they really have a host of benefits people might not be aware of.\u201dI started my foray into bilberry powder by adding a tablespoon to either my smoothie or coffee every day. It has a tart aftertaste\u2014somewhat like an underripe strawberry, and if you add too much, it can definitely make your mouth pucker. I found that adding it to my smoothie worked best because it served as the fruit component\u2014just with way less sugar. You can always add in honey or maple syrup to sweeten, but I like the way it tastes, so I don\u2019t.While nothing happened to my skin immediately, within a week, I had a definitive glowier look about me\u2014my dark acne spots were reduced, and my skin wasn\u2019t as dry as I\u2019d expect it to be in the winter. The biggest test, though, was when I went to San Francisco for the weekend, eating and drinking all the things that would normally aggravate my skin (dairy and sugar), and sleeping way too little while drinking more than usual. Instead of the patchy skin and pimples on my chin that I normally had to look forward to, my skin was softer, and I had absolutely ZERO breakouts. I had been doing nothing differently other than adding in this powder, so I now believe in its magic.\u201cIt\u2019s just a fruit, so it doesn\u2019t taste funky or weird at all,\u201d says Cindy DiPrima, co-founder of CAP Beauty. \u201cThe brand really focuses on foraging for pure, clean products in the wild that are picked at optimum freshness. It\u2019s such a great way to get maximum nutrition from the lightest product.\u201dBilberry powder is now a core part of my daily ritual\u2014partly because it tastes so damn good, and partly because it just works. I add it in smoothies for a tart kick, oatmeal or pancakes for a fun vibrant color, in my coffee when I don\u2019t have time for breakfast, or at night in hot green tea. DiPrima even suggests baking with it or drinking it in a latte like you would turmeric or matcha.Would I say I\u2019ve turned back the clock on my skin? My skin is definitely brighter. But more importantly, I didn\u2019t break out on two long-haul flights in the span of a week, have recently been told I look good by my very judgmental relatives, seen my dark circles substantially reduce, and have generally been feeling better. I would say that\u2019s a total win\u2026 and, now, those comparisons to my lucky-as-hell parents are justified.Buy it: Nordic Nordic\u2019s Bilberry Powder, $21All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
