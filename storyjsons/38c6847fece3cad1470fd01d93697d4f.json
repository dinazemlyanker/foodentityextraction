I just know I will relish the flavor and reap the benefits and sing its praises for all time, forever, amen. It\u2019s a feeling, not a science.Somehow, though, the first two jars of sauerkraut I tried reached their expiration date still half-full. The first one I tried was too pungent; the next was too pasteurized (honest mistake). Out went the jars, and out went the wild optimism I\u2019d placed in sauerkraut.Some months later, I heard about a fermented foods brand called Cultured Guru right where I used to live in Baton Rouge. Its microbe-rich pickles, sauerkraut, and kimchi line the refrigerators of health food stores across Louisiana, from Whole Foods to the no-frills neighborhood shop where I break for produce and plate lunches. Cultured Guru\u2019s Instagram feed of plant-based bowls\u2014bibimbap! sushi bowls! supersized, spiralized salads!\u2014mesmerized me. So did the science behind its products.Put that sauerkraut in a grain bowl.\nMicrobiologist and co-owner Kaitlynn Fenley developed Cultured Guru\u2019s small-batch sauerkraut recipe to allow \u201cthe best probiotic microbes from the cabbage to thrive and remain throughout the fermentation process,\u201d she says. A super-specific ratio of sea salt, water, and cabbage means the finished product teems with lots (and lots) of species of Lactobacillus. Fenley tests every batch to be sure.So yeah, I had reason to believe this sauerkraut would be good for me. But I really wanted to know if it would taste good.Cue the praises.Its saltiness, brightness, and just-right tang made me wonder how I ever gave up on sauerkraut. It tasted and crunched like fresh cabbage (!!) after three-ish weeks of fermentation. Turns out, fermenting in an oak barrel keeps the cabbage crisp thanks to tannins, and it boosts the number of bacteria species in the veg. This, I\u2019m told, sets Cultured Guru apart from other fermentation companies in the United States.Now, I\u2019m scooping it onto salads, burgers, and breakfast skillets or downing shots of brine like it\u2019s lemonade. Just like that, I\u2019m stocking up on sauerkraut again before the jar in the fridge even dips below half full.Buy it: Cultured Guru Sauerkraut, $9.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
