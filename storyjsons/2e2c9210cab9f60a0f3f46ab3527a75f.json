If you sign up for our newsletter, you\u2019ll get her letter before everyone else.It\u2019s hard to believe that this never-ending year is finally coming to a close, but here we are, just a few days away from ringing in 2021. One of my goals for next year is to be more intentional with how and why I spend money by supporting more small businesses whose values I share and donating with more regularity to organizations and charities doing important work.With that in mind, I asked my coworkers if they had any favorite organizations supporting the people who make up the food and restaurant industries, and the answers are so good that I thought I\u2019d share them with you all in case you have a similar New Year\u2019s resolution and want to get a head start.
