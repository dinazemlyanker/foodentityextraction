Agree re black pepper v sechuan. Prefer latter.  Would think marinade is a ratio so 2 2 1 of any measure would work.\nNote recipe says ...or 1/2 tsp chilli  flake not plus.\nand as for fellow Aussie don't see any mention of Keto in recipe description!MarleneWestern Australia 1/12/2022We make this all of the time! love it!\nBTW \"Joppo\"\nRead the recipe... \nAdd dried chiles, scallions, Fresno chile, ginger, garlic, and peppercorns.

As they suggest, use raw cashews rather than peanuts. It\u2019s fantastic. Btw, the Mala Market specializes in Sichuan ingredients \u2014 peppers, peppercorns, oils (they are the sole American importer of Caiziyou, far as I know), and so much more.Hollis RamseyVero Beach, FL6/12/2021Looks delicious but definitely not keto, beginners on keto bewareJoshPerth Australia4/27/2021This recipe was super delicious and easy to make - I had most of the ingredients already in my house, and the cooking process was very straight-forward. I would recommend this recipe if you like spicy food! I\u2019m definitely making this again. AnonymousPennsylvania1/10/2021this recipe almost drew blood as we fought each other over every scrap.  fabulous.brushjlsolon, oh12/3/2020Is the marinade supposed to be tablespoon and not tsp?

For all you heat-seekers, this is the recipe for you! \nI couldn't find Fresno chiles in my grocery store, so I used one whole sliced Hungarian pepper in its place and it worked well, as well as providing a bit of a color difference too. I have used the marinade recipe a couple times now and used other ingredients for the veggies, so it's a pretty versatile marinade in that way. I don't know if the dried chiles are intended to be eaten or just served with it and set aside, but a friend and I both ate one when and realized they are an extreme spice kick that made it unpleasant. So maybe they're just to add a little heat to the dish but not to be eaten? The dish also reheated pretty well the next day.Matthew LynessVirginia10/12/2019To me, this didn't have a lot of depth of flavor. All the textures worked really well together but it felt like it needed something to provide some punch or umami.AnonymousBuffalo10/4/2019This recipe is fabulous but warning, 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, 1 fresno chili WITH seeds, and 1/2 tsp Szechuan peppercorns makes for a very spicy dish, and I have a high heat tolerance. I would recommend cutting back the red pepper flakes and de-seeding the fresno chili if you are serving a more heat-averse crowd. AnonymousWorcester, MA10/2/2019The recipe ought to mention that while substituting black peppercorns for Sichuan peppercorns would certainly be tasty, they are in no way equivalent.  Black pepper just wouldn't give the mouth-numbing effect that Sichuan peppercorns have.AnonymousPennsylvania9/30/2019This appears to be a very straightforward recipe that\u2019s easily adjusted for personal tastes using ingredients I already have in my pantry. Gonna make this very soon. Looking forward to it.Jo HayesIllinois9/30/2019Yes she does tell you when to re add the chicken.  It's a perfect recipe!AnonymousTucson AZ9/29/2019You instruct to remove half cooked chicken to a plate, but never provide instruction as to when to add chicken back. It\u2019s just suddenly back in the pan at the end. Do we add chicken with all the other ingredients? With the sauce? After? Before?JoppoOakland, CA9/26/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titStir-FryChineseEast AsianAsianChickenPoultryChicken ThighChileVegetableBell PepperChicken BreastSichuan PeppercornHerbs & SpicesChile de \u00c1rbolFresno ChileWeeknight MealsQuickOne-Pot MealsMainDairy-FreeHealthyishSaut\u00e9DinnerRecipes you want to make.
