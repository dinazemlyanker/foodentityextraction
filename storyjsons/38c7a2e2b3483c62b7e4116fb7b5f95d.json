Then I Tried These Spanish CalamariSpanish conservas brand G\u00fceyu Mar is finally (!) available in the States. Buy many tins. Serve them with everything.\u00a0By Benjamin KemperFebruary 25, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto courtesy G\u00fceyu MarFacebookTwitterEmailAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

As a six-year Madrid transplant, I\u2019d eaten calamares en su tinta (squid in ink sauce) in abuelas\u2019 kitchens, neighborhood taverns, and starchy fine-dining restaurants, but it never tasted like this. How on earth could such a delicacy come from a can?G\u00fceyu Mar, which hit the U.S. market in December (full list of retailers here), is not like other conservas companies you may have heard about. While most traditional canneries steam their seafood before packing it in water or oil, G\u00fceyu Mar goes primal, cooking its sardines, cockles, squid, what have you, over live oakwood flame. This step imbues each morsel with an intoxicating smokiness that, to me, evokes sunny Mediterranean seafood shacks and pre-pandemic beach barbecues.Once the seafood is cooked, it\u2019s either drenched in thick green arbequina olive oil from Castillo de Canena and sealed, or destined for meal-in-a-can wonders like sardines in escabeche (garlicky vinaigrette) or that blissfully chthonic squid, which G\u00fceyu Mar dubs calamares de otro planeta (squid from another planet). I always have a few G\u00fceyu Mar cans in the cupboard for when hunger strikes\u2014and motivation doesn\u2019t. Lately I\u2019ve been tipping whole tins of cockles into linguine for a quick, smoky vongole and bulking up my pan con tomate with sardine loins.If these cans sound very chef-y (and more expensive) than most, that\u2019s because they are: G\u00fceyu Mar is named for a well-known seafood restaurant in Playa de la Vega, Asturias. Its chef, Abel \u00c1lvarez, makes no compromises when it comes to quality of ingredients, and that approach applies to his tins as well.Friends who have dined at G\u00fceyu Mar tell me it\u2019s a Spanish seafood Eden\u2014picture a converted stone house in the middle of nowhere with views out to the Cantabrian Sea. Traveling to Asturias may be off the table for the time being, but with a tin or two of G\u00fceyu Mar conservas\u2014and a bit of imagination\u2014you\u2019re basically halfway there.Photo By Jorge Lopez GhisoliG\u00fceyu Mar Grilled Cockles$47 at Despa\u00f1a Brand FoodsWant to shop in person?
