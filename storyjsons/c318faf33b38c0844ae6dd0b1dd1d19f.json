Stay for the amazing food.By Simeon Hall Jr.October 27, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhotograph by Julian CousinsFacebookTwitterEmailPresented by Silversea CruisesI consider myself a culinary griot. As in, I\u2019m a storyteller, and the unapologetic theme that underlies my storytelling is that each major island in my native Bahamas has its own unique flavor. The Bahamas is an archipelago of 700 islands, so let\u2019s start with New Providence, where I grew up and honed my skills as a chef.\u00a0This island capital, which is only 21 by seven square miles, is a melting pot of natives, immigrants, and tourists, which influences the food culture. Here you\u2019ll find burgeoning craft cocktail bars alongside conch salad stands and restaurants featuring the food of fellow islands the world over (Thai curries!) a short drive away from no-frills kitchens focused on Bahamian cooking. These are the restaurants, bars, and shops I visit again and again. I always tell people to come for the sun, sand, and sea, but stay for the food of my homeland.The EssentialsWhen to Visit:Between August 1 and March 31 (lobster season!)Where to Stay:Baha Mar, the islands\u2019 newest luxury resort with three world-class hotels and a wide array of dining experiencesWhat to Bring Back:Locally produced Bee in the Bahamas guava jamFisherman Yellow\u2019s Conch StandPhotograph by Julian CousinsConch salad in The Bahamas is what barbecue is to Texas, what poke is to Hawaii, and what ceviche is to Peru: a local delicacy. It typically includes the raw, chewy mollusk; fresh vegetables; and citrus. Everyone has their go-to combination, and mine comes from this conch stand along Montagu Beach. Fisherman Yellow and his team craft each bowl as skillfully as a well-tailored suit. Whether your conch salad is filled with firm seasonal mangoes, native goat peppers, and extra lime or is scorched (the local term for scored) with onion, lime, orange, and Bahamian bird pepper (my favorite), it\u2019s a must-order. To not have conch salad while in The Bahamas is to not have visited.Island Brothers & CieThis French bistro with island vibes is where I take friends when I want to impress. Located just outside the upscale Lyford Cay community, Island Brothers & Cie is a quaint restaurant run by a family of French expats. I always order whatever the specials are on the menu and the delectable Wagyu bavette with pomme frites. While I usually dine indoors for the ambience, last summer\u2019s breezes have made me keen for the outdoor dining experience here too.Evelyn\u2019s KitchenPhotograph by Julian CousinsIf you\u2019re visiting The Bahamas, I\u2019m definitely taking you to this cozy food trailer on Potter\u2019s Cay dock. Evelyn and her crew serve a mix of Bahamian and Haitian foods: steam ham, ham braised in tomato sauce; griot, citrus-marinated fried pork; and fried fish. This is the kind of home cooking I wish I saw in more restaurants.Sun & IcePhotograph by Julian CousinsWhat do you get when you add local Bahamian fruits, spices, herbs, and nostalgia to a rich cr\u00e8me anglaise? This delightful ice cream shop from chefs Wayne and Ivana Moncur. Situated in the lobby of the Atlantis resort\u2019s Coral tower, the shop churns out small batches of seasonal, locally sourced flavors, like soursop and caramelized sugar banana, allspice potato bread, and benny cake crumble. The dynamic duo also owns Bakehouse, which is known for its creative doughnuts, such as guava-strawberry, PB&J, and hibiscus.ShimaPhotograph by Julian CousinsOn any given night Shima is the backdrop to a date, an important business meeting, a wedding proposal, a party for the newly divorced, and the like. (Shima\u2019s been my spot for a few of these reasons!) The food here celebrates the delicate, savory flavors of Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam and uses local ingredients, which makes it feel very Bahamian. The brunch is popular, but I go for dinner and order all the small plates, which change often. If you see the grilled roti\u2014flaky and charred to perfection\u2014get it.Caf\u00e9 MatisseParents never openly admit to having a favorite child, although they surely have a stronger connection with one. That\u2019s how I feel about this old-school Italian spot, where the food and service are consistently on point. Try the homemade ravioli with osso buco and roast gravy, or ask about the daily specials. Either way it\u2019ll be unforgettable.Bon VivantsPhotograph by Julian CousinsThis is the premier craft cocktail bar of The Bahamas. The bartenders are not just adept but entertaining, and their drinks don\u2019t disappoint. I love the Big Major Smash, a Bahamian tiki-style rum concoction, and the Zephyr, a citrus-forward gin and tonic. A lot of restaurant folks come here after dinner or a shift to unwind. Just make sure your phone is charged\u2014not only are the drinks stunning but so is the decor. It\u2019s Instagram overloadNesbitt\u2019sThis decades-old mainstay is an earshot away from the crashing waves of the northern shoreline in the Delaporte community. Locals gather to talk about island politics, international news, and gossip, but they linger for the seafood. For breakfast there is an amazing stew fish, the catch of the day simmered in a velvety brown-roux gravy. For dinner there is lightly-floured-and-fried grouper seasoned with bird pepper.Where to Island HopPhotograph by Julian CousinsGrand BahamaGo to the Dolphin Cove resort for gorgeous views, then drive to West End for pickled conch.\u00a0Great Exuma IslandVisit the world-famous swimming pigs in Big Major Cay and enjoy fried fish or roasted veg on the beach.\u00a0Harbour IslandFor a luxurious excursion stay at The Landing hotel and try the acclaimed restaurant\u2019s spicy crab capellini.\u00a0North AbacoAfter Hurricane Dorian, Richie\u2019s Restaurant has returned better than ever.
