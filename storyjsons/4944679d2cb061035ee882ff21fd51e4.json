In her monthly column, nearly lifelong vegetarian Sarah Jampel will tackle cooking, eating, and navigating the world meat-free\u2014even when her grandma still doesn't know what she makes for dinner.If I were ever to go on a meat bender, I have a mental list of what I\u2019d eat first. (Maybe that\u2019s weird, but is it really so different from keeping a rolodex of celebrity crushes? Not going to happen but fun to imagine?) It\u2019s a short list, really: lobster, duck (it just gets so crispy), chorizo, and chicken. Chicken soup, in particular. As a vegetarian, I feel like I\u2019m missing out every time I smell it. (And if you\u2019re like, \u201cSarah, why don\u2019t you just eat the chicken soup already?\u201d I respect the question but feel like it\u2019s a topic for another article.)There are few vegetable broths that can achieve that same depth of flavor and body as chicken soup, but this recipe does. In 15 minutes, I\u2019ve got a rich, savory, totally chickenless but chickenesque broth that makes me forget those swampy vegetable brews of the past.Related: The Case for Quitting Meat with Sarah Jampel and Chrissy TraceyContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.It starts with softening onions in olive oil, then grating in garlic and adding a dollop of miso paste. By smashing the miso paste down into the fat and cooking it until it starts to darken and stick to the bottom of the pan, you\u2019ll draw out moisture, caramelize the sugars, and intensify the flavors, just like you would tomato paste.But now comes the real kicker: steeped nutritional yeast, the idea for which came from the brilliant Andrea Nguyen\u2019s vegan pho. To capture the cheesy, nutty, saltiness of nutritional yeast without making the soup sludgy or gritty, you\u2019ll pour hot water over the nooch, let its flavors permeate the liquid, then pour off the golden top, leaving behind the thick sediment.You can stop here and use the broth as is\u2014it really is good enough to sip and will accommodate any vegetables, beans, or grains you throw at (in?) it. But I encourage you to make the second component of this recipe, too. Inspired by the South Asian dish dharan ji kadhi, chickpea flour fritters stewed in tomato sauce, the dumplings are a simple mixture of chickpea flour (a.k.a. besan), yogurt, and herbs. When simmered in the broth, they puff dramatically, becoming tender but still toothsome, not far from a matzo ball. If you don\u2019t have chickpea flour, you could make matzo balls (am I crazy?). If you don\u2019t have matzo meal, you could make the dumplings from Rick Martinez\u2019s Chicken and Dumplings. Or you could skip the dumplings entirely and add frozen peas and noodles. It\u2019s your game!Yes, maybe I\u2019ll still get a sparkle in my eye when I catch a whiff of chicken stock bubbling on the stove. But now that I have this recipe in my arsenal, I can safely say the meat bender has been delayed for many years in the future.Get the recipe:Chickpeas and DumplingsThis recipe gives off major chicken-soup vibes but is entirely vegetarian\u2014and you don\u2019t have to simmer vegetables or cheese rinds for hours to get there. The lightning-fast broth gets its flavor from caramelized miso and nutritional yeast (a trick we picked up from Bay Area cookbook author and food writer Andrea Nguyen). The gluten-free dumplings are soft on the outside and pleasantly chewy on the inside.\u00a0View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titThe Not Depressing VegetarianHealthyishRead MorecookingMake a Whole Galette For Yourself Because You\u2019re Worth ItBy Sarah JampelRecipes you want to make.
