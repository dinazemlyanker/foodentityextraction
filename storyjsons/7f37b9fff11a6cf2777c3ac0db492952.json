In fact, she doesn\u2019t like talking about herself much at all. She certainly doesn\u2019t want to be the subject of a profile, and, yet, here she is, running the show as chef de cuisine at The Grill, the high-wattage revamp of gilded New York institution The Four Seasons, and one of the most talked-about restaurants in the city. Despite her modesty, Rath is churning pure magic out of the restaurant\u2019s pristine, white kitchen. She\u2019s responsible for that juicy, truffle-coated guinea hen that Pete Wells called \u201cone of the most delicious things I\u2019ve eaten this year\u201d in his three-star review, the golden-brown crab cake, brimming with tender crab meat and crowned by crisp, golden potato medallions, and the club sandwich, a typically ho-hum country club staple elevated to something extraordinary with an oozy egg, crackly bacon, and crusty, platonic layers of house-made white bread.Rath is 29, with a loose ponytail, big, curious eyes, and an obsessive, hyper-organized personality. In this way, at least, she fits right in at The Grill, where pen lasers are used to perfectly align the silverware on each table. But, in other ways, she\u2019s a surprising presence in a place whose menu and decor evoke the Mad-Men era of NYC restaurants, a time when you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a woman in the dining room let alone behind the stove.\u201cWhen I walked in,\u201d she says of her first visit to the mid-century-opulent space, \u201cI was shaking. I couldn\u2019t believe this was my kitchen. It was both satisfying and unnerving.\u201dBut even before The Grill, Rath had been a secret weapon for The Grill\u2019s parent company, Major Food Group. She helped with the openings of two of the company\u2019s other wildly successful spots, the coastal Italian restaurant Santina and the neon-clad bistro, Dirty French. She has already made an indelible stamp on the New York dining scene\u2014and she\u2019s only been cooking for seven years.The Grill's steak and anchovy tartare\nPhoto by Daniel KriegerRath, a Syracuse native, initially set out to do non-profit work, studying food sovereignty rights at St. Andrews in Scotland. But when a visa mix-up cannibalized the NGO job she had lined up in India, she ended up in New York, working for a corporate, Sodexo-run restaurant in Midtown. \u201cI had no idea what I was doing,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI had no proper shoes, no knives, nothing.\u201dShe wasn\u2019t even sure she wanted to stay in the profession. But then, \u201cI remember one day we had this busy lunch push, and I got this huge adrenaline rush. Yes I was making coconut shrimp at a crappy place but I remember calling my dad and saying, \u2018This is it.\u2019\u201dHer big breaks came from line cook positions at Atera, then run by ultra-disciplined chef Matthew Lightner, followed by Gramercy Tavern, where she received the basic culinary education she never had. In 2014, Major Food Group chef and restaurateur Daniel Haar called out of the blue to tell her about a sous chef job at soon-to-open Santina. Haar had met her when she trailed at now-shuttered Torrisi Italian Specialties, and he remembered her inquisitiveness and intensity.\u201cShe excelled and adapted and learned quickly,\u201d Haar says. \u201cShe possesses maniacal drive to conquer projects.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything specific about me that people latch onto,\u201d Rath says, characteristically, when asked how she managed to land positions at so many high-profile restaurants. \u201cThe way I see it: If you want it, you are going to work in a manner that runs around [the competition] because it\u2019s your life. It\u2019s your thing.\u201dRath ended up opening Santina and Dirty French within a year of each other. Then Haar asked her to join the opening team of The Grill, first as executive sous chef, then as chef de cuisine, where she has brought to life an exceedingly refined vision of classic Americana at a place where, yes, things cost a lot of money, but it\u2019s hard not to be thrilled by the sparkle and singularity of the meal.When Rath first met with the team about the menu, \u201cMario [Carbone, one of the owners of Major Food Group] had this really kitschy idea of taking inspiration from Betty Crocker and Campbell\u2019s cookbooks,\u201d she recalls. Rath took all those recipes and updated them to suit her more edited tastes: the mayo-heavy Crab Louis became a lighter, more refreshing Crab Louis with Avocado, the cream-filled Chicken \u00e0 la King became Chicken \u00e0 la Queen, with a tangy, red sauce base.The Grill's Lobster \u00e0 la Newburg\nPhoto by Adrian Gaut\u201cI didn\u2019t want to do anything that was precious,\u201d Rath says. She wanted to make food that she would want to eat in this type of setting. \u201cI like meat. I like fat. I like sauce work. I like the idea that you don\u2019t get a composed plate: If you want potatoes, you have to order them on the side.\u201dRath is very aware that Major Food Group is a company owned by three men. She hasn\u2019t had any female mentors as a chef, and she\u2019s one of only a few women in the kitchen. But her one female line cook, Megan Holzapfel, says that Rath is \u201cthe first female chef I have worked for who really holds her own and takes charge, and who isn\u2019t afraid to do her job with no apologies or tiptoeing around.\u201dThe ambience of The Grill is reminiscent of those age-old NYC restaurants whose clientele is still dominated by men in suits, with expense accounts, ordering prime rib and lamb chops. Rath once went out to greet a table of VIPs, and she saw the men do a double-take when she told them that she was the chef. Still, she insists, \u201cI don\u2019t feel my gender in any single way here.\u201d To her, there\u2019s no such thing as \u201cmale\u201d food or \u201cfemale\u201d food. There is just good food, which she wants to provide to every guest who walks through the door.The Grill has been open for almost a year now, and Rath still spends the vast majority of her waking hours there, training staff, perfecting dishes, making sure the restaurant is not only keeping up with its exacting standards, but progressing. Meanwhile, she\u2019s trying to buy her first apartment: a daunting task in NYC. She claims she has no aspirations of opening her own restaurant. \u201cI like running other people\u2019s shows,\u201d she says, convincingly. \u201cSome might call it self-deprecating, but I feel happy and satisfied here. And who wants to take on the financial burden of opening a restaurant in New York?\u201dBut Rath does plan to put her own mark on The Grill. She wants to hire more female cooks, and to be the female mentor she never had. And she wants to shape kitchen culture beyond gender, too. \u201cI want a culture where it is not your life to be here, but you are providing life to the restaurant. We aren\u2019t quite there yet,\u201d she says. Her cooks work too many days a week. The quality of life at the restaurant isn\u2019t as stable as it should be. The food needs to keep evolving. Thankfully, she says, hinting at a hidden swagger, \u201cI expect to be here for a very long time.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishChefsNew York CityNew YorkRead MorerestaurantsabcV Is the Juice Bar and Cafe We've Been Waiting ForBy Priya KrishnaRecipes you want to make.
