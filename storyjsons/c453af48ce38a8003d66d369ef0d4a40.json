It\u2019s pantry-friendly, takes under 45 minutes to prepare, and is packed with flavor thanks to supporting flavors like butter and wine. Use whichever salami fits your fancy\u2014Uskokovic uses finocchiona, or fennel salami, for an extra kick. For glossy, saucy noodles, use a large pot to thoroughly toss everything together.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

AnonymousOntario, Canada3/23/2022this was real tasty and very very easyMattbApalachin, NY12/3/2021Followed the recipe to the \"T\", and it was so amazing!  Wouldn't change a thing.  Amy OutlawHouston, TX11/27/2021Shrimp and salami, It had to be good. It also uses my new favorite vegetable, fennel. So I made it. It was a bit hot spicy for my wife's taste, but I and my guest, loved it. \n\nWhen I put effort into a dinner, I am often disappointed. My meal might be slightly better than what I would expect in an average restaurant. This was not disappointing. It had that WOW factor that made the dish worth the work and expense in preparing it.Zendoog3The Villages, Florida11/8/2021This reminds me of the Jambalaya I make with shrimp and kielbasa sausage. Shrimp and sausage together is delicious. I can\u2019t wait to try this which will give me a different way to make a pasta dish using shrimp.AnonymousPhiladelphia, PA11/7/2021Brilliant take on classic Portuguese flavours, where pork and shrimp together work really well in many of the region\u2019s classic dishes, such as cataplana. The lemon adds a nice bright zing, and the key is that tossing together with the pasta water to achieve a nice glossy texture and mouthfeel. Next time I will use Portuguese or Spanish chorizo, which would bring it slightly closer to home (and those are always in my pantry, whereas I rarely have salami).BlorkMontreal11/7/2021Salami together with shrimp? The horror...!Dog of TearsNew York, NY11/2/2021Easy to add more shrimp and/or salami.  3oz is used because that is the standard package of sliced at a store.  The name of it is: Finocchiona.  May be easier to find the pre-sliced package.  I cut mine into quarters.
