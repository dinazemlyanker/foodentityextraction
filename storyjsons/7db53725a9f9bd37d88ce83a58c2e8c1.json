Dear John\u2019s Is Ephemeral.The Culver City restaurant has a two-year lease until the building is bulldozed. But that\u2019s the whole point.By Alex BeggsSeptember 19, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Dylan + JeniFacebookTwitterEmailWhat would you do if you only had two years to live? That was the lease limit the owner of Dear John\u2019s in Culver City gave longtime L.A. chef Hans R\u00f6ckenwagner and his wife and business partner, Patti, before he planned to demolish the building. Their answer: Let\u2019s drink martinis and eat steak every night!\u201cWhen we announced the restaurant\u2019s opening, we also announced the closing, and that was intentional,\u201d Patti says. \u201cWe felt like we had nothing to lose. But we had everything to lose by not doing it.\u201d And so they revived the place\u2014a famous celebrity haunt in the 1960s nestled beside the studio lots\u2014with fresh velvet curtains and new kitchen equipment. But above all, art. The walls are covered with vintage paintings from the gallerist Robert Berman. A poodle in front of a fountain has as many admirers as the restaurant\u2019s crab Louis. A nude female matador reigns above the fireplace. The paintings warm up the dark 1,500-square-foot cavern, where it might be 5 p.m., 2 a.m., or midnight depending on how many martinis you\u2019ve had. \u201cIt\u2019s in a time zone of its own,\u201d Patti says.The paintings warm up the cavernous room.\nPhoto by Dylan + JeniThe menu, a collaboration between R\u00f6ckenwagner and Josiah Citrin (whose Santa Monica spot M\u00e9lisse temporarily closed in March for renovations), is so quintessential American steakhouse it could be a movie prop. The laminated ALL-CAPS list includes: Oysters Rockefeller. Prime New York strip. Creamed spinach. Lobster thermidor. Garlic bread. Frank Sinatra\u2019s spaghetti and clams (it\u2019s rumored the crooner performed at the restaurant back in its heyday). It\u2019s one of very few restaurants in the city that holds the trifecta: a liquor, entertainment, and dancing license. The martini, if you\u2019re wondering, is only spritzed with vermouth.And then they hired Hank, the spotless-tuxedo-wearing head ma\u00eetre d\u2019, who\u2019s fluffed more tableside Caesars than some chefs make in a lifetime. He raises the olive oil and allows it to aerate and emulsify. He cranks the pepper like a trained percussionist. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to teach Hank how to make a Caesar,\u201d says Patti, \u201che embodies it.\u201dWhen the lease expires in April 2021, Dear John\u2019s will be bulldozed for a big new development. Don\u2019t act surprised. Dear John\u2019s is the spritz of vermouth in the background of your martini. Ephemeral.\u201cThis is the new business model\u2014people don\u2019t want anything for 100 years,\u201d says Patti. \u201cIt\u2019s a two-year pop-up party. There\u2019s an immediacy, and that\u2019s the allure of the place.\u201d Liquor licenses might be forever, but restaurants come and go. Order the steak, get the side of garlic bread, and get swept up in it while you can.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurants + TravelCaliforniaHot 10 2019Los AngelesRead MorecookingAin't No Party Like a Shrimp Cocktail PartyBy Alison RomanRecipes you want to make.
