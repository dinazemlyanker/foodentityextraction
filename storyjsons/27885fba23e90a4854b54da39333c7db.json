Cover with water by at least 2\u201d and add shallot, bay leaves, and 1\u00bd Tbsp. salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer gently, adding water to keep beans submerged, until very soft but not split, 1\u00bd\u20132 hours. Let beans cool in liquid.Step 2Mix anchovies, garlic, parsley, capers, lemon zest, lemon juice, and \u00bd cup oil in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper. Drain beans and discard shallot and bay leaves. Add to parsley mixture, tossing to coat (save bean cooking liquid to make soup or add to your next batch of beans; it freezes well). Season beans with salt and more lemon juice, if desired.Step 3Whisk remaining \u00bc cup salt with 4 cups water in a shallow baking dish until salt is dissolved; add halibut (it should be submerged) and let sit 30 minutes (don\u2019t let it sit any longer or fish will be too salty).Step 4Remove halibut and pat dry. Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high and cook halibut (do not season) until a golden brown crust has formed, about 4 minutes. Flip and cook another minute or so, just to finish cooking through and sear the second side. Turn off heat and add butter to skillet. Tilt skillet and spoon foaming butter over fillets for another minute. Serve halibut with beans and lemon wedges for squeezing over.Nutrition Per ServingCalories (kcal) 495 Fat (g) 24 Saturated Fat (g) 5 Cholesterol (mg) 50 Carbohydrates (g) 30 Dietary Fiber (g) 12 Total Sugars (g) 0.5 Protein (g) 46 Sodium (mg) 2550How would you rate Pan-Roasted Halibut with Herbed Corona Beans?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (1)Back to TopTriangleI couldn't find the right beans, so I used canned Cannellini beans. Drained, Rinsed, then cooked them with the shallot, bay leaves, &  salt for about 15-20 mins.\nDid everything else the same after that point; AMAZING and will be one of our regular recipes from now on-husband loved it, too!Anonymous3/9/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titHalibutFishSeafoodGigante BeanWhite BeanBeanVegetableEasyMainGluten-FreeNut-FreeHealthyishSearDinnerRecipes you want to make.
