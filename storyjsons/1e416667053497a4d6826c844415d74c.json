No turkey juices necessary.By Alex BeggsNovember 9, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiFacebookTwitterEmailThanksgiving week is what we call GO TIME. The flickering grocery store lights become too familiar. The fridge begins to lose every inch of free space. Printed recipes taped to different cabinets make the kitchen look like a war room on a crime show. Planning what to make ahead\u2014from three days before to the morning of\u2014is a home cook\u2019s final exam. We waited all year for this! And usually, gravy is assumedly a day-of dish, made with scalding turkey drippings, frantically stirred with the one roux you make a year, maybe too thick or too thin but hurry and get that thing on the table!Let\u2019s make it ahead this year.Andy Baraghani wanted a velvety, flavor-packed gravy that you can get over with days in advance, reheat on Thanksgiving, with no one ever knowing the difference. You can either use turkey stock or boxed chicken stock (the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen likes Pacific brand). But because store-bought stock lacks complexity and depth and can veer to the sweeter side, Andy doctors it up with a burst of umami\u2014that savory fifth taste triggered by good Parmesan cheese and funky mushrooms. Here\u2019s how he does it.Look who planned ahead.\nPhoto by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiWith a Turkey NeckYou know how your turkey comes with a bag of giblets and other turkey...innards? In this recipe, you brown the turkey neck, creating a fond\u2014the French term for a layer of caramelized fat on the bottom of a pot. That fond (\ud83d\ude44) adds backbone and depth and turkey flavor. It\u2019s the base layer of our umami gravy.With Some OnionsWe don\u2019t normally think about onions as being sweet, but damn, they are sweet. In this recipe, you need to cook them until they\u2019re tender and browning around the edges, a quick cook, not the low-and-slow caramelized onion method, which makes them waaaay too sweet. That almost burnt edge gives the gravy a deep savory note.With Shiitake MushroomsThese add mega-umami. Absolute must.Spooning the stock into the roux.\nPhoto by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiWith a Fortified StockOnce all of the base aromatics and elements have browned and done their thing, you add the neck back in the pot with whatever stock you\u2019re using and cook it like a stock, then strain. After that you follow the usual gravy steps: Make a roux with fine flour and butter, gradually whisking in the fortified stock. It\u2019ll thicken into a smooth, dreamy gravy and we call it quits when it coats the back of a (very necessary) taste-testing spoon.That final hit.\nPhoto by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiWith a Final Drop of Soy SauceJust a teaspoon, at the end (so it won\u2019t cook off). The final umami hit. The extra credit. Then you can refrigerate it two days before the big day, reheating and whisking it to perfection on the stove.Get the Recipe:Umami GravyWe made it our business to create an excellent gravy with store-bought broth\u2014no ham hocks, chicken parts, or hours-long simmering involved.
