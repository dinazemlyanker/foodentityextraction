Take a look at my byline and call me biased, but some of my favorite noodles are Japanese: soba, udon, somen. Quickly boiled and dressed with some scallions, grated ginger, store-bought tsuyu, and a handful of ice, it\u2019s dinner in 10 minutes. There\u2019s nothing easier and there\u2019s nothing better.But I don\u2019t always have the requisite noodles on hand, and maybe you don\u2019t either. At times like these, I suggest surveying that stock of pasta you may have supplemented during February\u2019s COVID-19 shopping spree to check for a box of the long, thin variety. With this, you can approximate the noodles for the popular summer dish hiyashi chuuka (a.k.a. reimen, if you are from western Japan like me).In a popular hack that\u2019s been espoused by many a Japanese cooking blog, regular semolina pasta is boiled with baking soda to make an excellent substitute for the bouncy, chewy noodles known as chuukamen. Chuukamen is the general term used to describe an array of (what Japanese consider to be) Chinese-style noodles (chuuka = Chinese-style and men = noodle). You have seen chuukamen as the yellow noodles in ramen, yakisoba, and the aforementioned hiyashi chuuka.These defining characteristics boil down (ha!) to the use of highly alkaline water (kansui) in the wheat-based chuukamen dough, which makes the chuukamen yellow and springy. (It is this kansui and the wheat flour that defines chuukamen.) Thus, adding alkaline baking soda into the boiling water allows the pasta to mimic the texture and color of chuukamen.\u00a0You can play fast and loose with the quantities here, but start with this: one generous handful (100 grams) of cappellini (any long shape will do, but cappellini best mimics the thickness of the most conventional chuukamen noodles), 1 tablespoon of baking soda, 1 tablespoon of salt, and 1 liter boiling water (that\u2019s about 4 cups). Boil per the package instructions until pleasantly chewy and bouncy. Here\u2019s the important step: Rinse your noodles thoroughly to wash off the excess baking soda. After that, you\u2019re good to go.This recipe is a riff on hiyashi chuuka, with tons of tender summer veg.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kat BoytsovaI like to throw my rinsed noodles into a bowl filled with ice water while I cobble together some toppings from my fridge. For the popular and classic preparation that is hiyashi chuuka, top a pile of chilled noodles with julienned cucumber, egg crepe, ham, and poached shrimp (if you\u2019re fancy) before dousing it in a sesame dressing. This is a summer menu special so popular at ramen restaurants that my brother, who worked at the one housed in the Mitsuwa supermarket in Edgewater, New Jersey (where it is adorned with char siu pork in lieu of ham), still blanches at the memory of having to prepare it in rapid succession.But my scavenger hunt often leads to a clean-out-the fridge version of hiyashi chuuka that strays a bit from the classic described above. I approximate an easy dressing by crushing toasted sesame seeds into premade tsuyu and doctoring it with sugar, rice (or apple cider) vinegar, grated ginger, and sesame oil. It\u2019s meant to be easy and flexible, so if I\u2019m out of tsuyu, I sub in soy sauce. Toppings might include strips of tofu, tamagoyaki, radishes, cucumbers, and even kimchi if I\u2019ve got it. (If you need some more inspiration, look here and here.)Like any bowl of noodles, hiyashi chuuka is endlessly adaptable to any topping or dressing. And when the weather gets cold, the alkalized noodles also adapt well to soups and broths like that ultimate classic, ramen. It\u2019s truly a noodle hack for the ages.Chihiro Tomioka buys chocolate chip ice cream for the chocolate chips and has written about all things Japanese at Food52.Explore Bon App\u00e9titJapaneseNoodleRamenRecipes you want to make.
