One more piece of bread? Toast it, and whip up your own butter. Got a few hardboiled eggs? Make your own mayo and mix it into egg salad. Trying to finish the last of your greens? Put it to good use by pairing it with a creamy miso dressing. Got veggies but nothing to eat \u2019em with? How about some homemade hummus? The thing that makes all of this actually fast and easy? A Mini-Prep food processor.\u201cI love my tiny food processor,\u201d senior food editor Molly Baz says as she pulls out her Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus and cradles it in her arms. \u201cI keep my three-cup on the counter because it barely takes up space, and I end up using it all the time,\u201d adds food editor Anna Stockwell.That\u2019s because any task that requires chopping, slicing, or shredding can be tackled with a food processor, whose ridged and razor-sharp blades cut through ingredients as a chef\u2019s knife would\u2014but a lot faster. Pesto is ready in moments, with the mini prep taking on the hard pine nuts, sticky garlic, and tender basil all in one go. Dressings too, like this walnut-anchovy one. In fact, its ability to handle those different textures all at once is the machine\u2019s biggest advantage over something like a blender, which, with its super fast motor, strives to bring uniformity to each ingredient.With a mini food processor, things still get done quick\u2014but you won\u2019t have to sacrifice consistency for speed.Buy it: Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Food Processor, $32 on AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
