But yes, there was a time when those little chicken embryos were just Not. My. Thing. I was particularly opposed to the chalky, crumbly yolks that my young tastebuds associated with garden soil, and I\u2019d beg my good, protein-peddling Ma for \u201cjust the whites, pleeeeaase.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t until recently, when I tried Peckish, that all that changed. These aren\u2019t just any eggs! Peckish\u2014a direct-to-consumer, hard-boiled egg company incubated by Jon Sebastiani\u2019s Sonoma Brands\u2014sells organic, free-range, and certified-humane eggs in very pretty packaging. These eggs are boiled to perfection (okay, so they\u2019re definitely on the well-done side. But who wants UPS to handle your jammy yolks, anyway?). According to VP of Brand Lauren Egan, nerdy chefs closely monitor cooking temperatures from start to finish. The resulting eggs are \u201cexactly how we love to make them at home\u2014not too hard and not too soft,\u201d she says.Just look at that savory sprinkle.\nPhoto by Chelsea Kyle\u201cBut wait a minute,\u201d you\u2019re thinking. \u201cWhat about those yolks you always hated?\u201d Inside each of their Peck Packs, along with two individually wrapped eggs, comes a container of sprinkles in one of five flavors: Everything (yep, like the bagel), Fried Rice, Rancheros, Salt & Pepitas, and Maple Waffles. You just dunk your egg, bite, and repeat. The toppings are all gluten and refined sugar free, paleo, keto, and Whole30, too. They\u2019re made from things like organic quinoa crispies, roasted pepitas, and dehydrated veggies. And the only sweeteners you\u2019ll ever see are coconut sugar and maple syrup.Aside from a quick snack, Peckish eggs and toppings are also easily incorporated into (sprinkled on) meals. Egan suggests adding the Fried Rice eggs to a quick ramen or the Everything flavor into a sandwich. \u201cRancheros on avocado toast is a crowd favorite,\u201d she says.So sue me: I love hard-boiled eggs now.Back in Australia, we\u2019d call this pivot a \u201cSteve Bradbury.\u201d It\u2019s is a complex and culturally niche reference. But in this analogy, Peckish is Steve, triumphantly skating from underdog into the gold medal slot.
