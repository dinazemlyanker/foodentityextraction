I could eat a whole pot to myself rn and I'm trying my best not to! Agree with the other reviewers that you could make this with a lot less oil and it would still be perfect. I think a quarter cup would be sufficient next time. AnonymousLondon, UK12/31/2021Made this for Thanksgiving.  Everyone loved it!  I will use less oil next time, and 60 min was plenty of time.  50 probably would have been fine.  I used crushed garlic instead of a whole head.  Jill GNorth Carolina11/27/2020This was excellent! I cut squash in the half for roasting then I scooped squash out and mixed with aromatic oil and goat cheese. Wow. Great taste! briggitazFlorida11/23/2018These are amazing! Don't have harissa so I use sambal oelek. Soak up all the oil with some naan and drift off to food heaven.Anonymoustexas9/27/2018Didn't have harissa, so I mixed 1/2 teaspoon each of chili powder, cumin, and coriander.  Very tasty.  Used less oil that the recipe calls for, and forgot the vinegar, and it was just fine.  Beans (home grown pole beans) had an interesting texture - not soft even after 70 minutes.AnonymousVermont9/21/2018This dish is amazing!AnonymousSeattle WA9/3/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titAfricanNorth AfricanGreen BeanVegetableHarissaCondiments, Sauces & PastesSideVegetarianVeganDairy-FreeNut-FreeGluten-FreeHealthyishRoastRecipes you want to make.
