Though modestly sized with a population of just 133,000, St. Catharines boasts a mighty dining scene that punches far above its weight class. One of the brightest stars in its colorful constellation of restaurants is oddBird, the eclectic eatery from chef-partners Scott White and Justin Duc.  The duo\u2019s menu changes often and on a whim, and  influences are far-flung and far-ranging: Here you\u2019ll find anything from a blood-red horse heart tartare to sticky-sweet General Tso's duck breast to a massive c\u00f4te de boeuf taco platter. But where do White and Duc eat when they\u2019re not in their own kitchen? To find out, the pair took us on a flavor-filled tour of their city\u2019s global gems.Ma Chinese CuisineFirst we stroll up to Ma, one of White and Duc\u2019s favorite haunts for Chinese eats. Though ensconced in an impressive red brick building dating back to the turn of the last century, it\u2019s the interior that\u2019ll really make you gasp. \u201cIt\u2019s just a gorgeous, wonderfully designed space,\u201d Duc said, his eyes darting around the dramatically lit dining room decked out with a wood-beam ceiling, stone floors, and industrial accents. We sit down and scope the menu, which delivers flavors straight from Hong Kong, Shanghai, Chongqing, and beyond. \u201cNot only is the lobster juicy, tender, and deeply fragrant, it\u2019s one of the most spectacular looking things you can get here,\u201d Duc said, pointing to the gargantuan crustacean at the center of the table. We\u2019ve ordered it sauteed with flavor-packed peanuts and crispy fried garlic, but you can also get it with ginger and scallions, underneath mountains of diced garlic, or wok-baked with soy sauce. Other can\u2019t-miss menu items? Anything on the dim-sum menu, which includes authentic nosh like delicate steamed-shrimp dumplings and golden-hued egg tarts, not to mention the elegantly plated Peking duck. \u201cIt\u2019s refreshing to have real Chinese food in St. Catharines, and not just some Americanized version of Chinese food,\u201d White said. \u201cThis place is the real deal.\u201dLang RestaurantJust three blocks away, our taste buds shift from China to Vietnam. Grilled meat and hot pot are the dual focuses of Lang BBQ, which White and Duc dig for its bang-on flavors and homey atmosphere. The duo make quick work of the menu, ordering up slivers of fatty pork belly, springy squid balls, and coins of lotus root to simmer in fragrant broth. While it bubbles away, we spark up the grill built right into the table and char slices of curried chicken and Vietnamese sausage over a crackling flame. \u201cIt\u2019s a cool family-style thing, really interactive,\u201d said White. \u201cIt reminds me of Christmas when I was a kid with my meat fondue!\u201dSahla Thai RestaurantLess than a 10-minute walk away is Sahla Thai Restaurant, White\u2019s go-to Thai joint. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of my family spot,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all have our birthdays there.\u201d Without hesitating, White orders a steaming plate of piled-high pad Thai\u2014the classic rice noodle dish stir-fried with shrimp, chicken, eggs, bean sprouts, green onions, and finely chopped peanuts\u2014and follows it up with a creamy bowl of Penang curry enriched with coconut milk, peanut curry sauce, and slivers of beef. \u201cTheir curry has just the right level of spice, the perfect consistency, and the flavors are just killer,\u201d he said, spooning the rich sauce over a mound of fluffy white rice.La Scala RistoranteAfter a five-minute walk down St. Paul Street, St. Catharines\u2019s bustling main artery lined with boutiques and restaurants, we hang a right down a relatively quiet side street to find Italian mainstay La Scala. White and Duc make a beeline for the charming outdoor terrace and snag a table. \u201cIt\u2019s got one of the nicest patios in the whole downtown area, plus the food is really authentic Italian,\u201d Duc said. We order a bevy of delights: the panini stuffed with thin slices of prosciutto, roasted red peppers, and creamy fiore di latte; a mound of juicy P.E.I. mussels draped in an anise-flavored black sambuca sauce; a hearty plate of penne classico smothered in a rich homemade sauce of San Marzano tomatoes; and herb-marinated calamari grilled to crispy perfection.Chile & AgaveNext up, we pile into the car and drive 10 minutes across town to Chile & Agave for a midday pick-me-up. \u201cIt\u2019s probably some of the most authentic Mexican food you can get in St. Catharines,\u201d White said of this colorful hangout jam-packed with vibrant, straight-from-Mexico decor. We opt for specialties including the tacos Yucatan, which come stuffed with jumbo grilled shrimp glazed with tequila-spiked honey, and a platter of flour quesadillas overflowing with tender slices of nopal cactus. Of course, Duc notes, we can\u2019t leave without tossing back a shot or two. \u201cThe tequila tasting is always good,\u201d he said.George's Greek VillageThough we\u2019re nearly stuffed, we begin to feel hunger pangs as we drive the five minutes to George\u2019s Greek Village. It\u2019s a miracle! Before we even look at a menu, White puts in an order for the grilled octopus drizzled with ouzo. \u201cIt\u2019s rare to find octopus on a menu here, and it\u2019s even harder to find octopus that's done well,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a good indicator of a quality spot.\u201d We round out the meal with the restaurant\u2019s dramatic saganaki\u2014a hearty slab of decadent kefalotiri cheese sauteed in olive oil and flamb\u00e9ed tableside\u2014and a smattering of creamy dips from roe-infused taramasalata to garlicky skordalia.Our daylong eating tour concluded, it\u2019s finally time for White and Duc to put away their appetites. Or is it? \u201cWe\u2019re headed to oddBird,\u201d White said with a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s time to cook dinner.\u201dStill hungry for more Niagara eats?
