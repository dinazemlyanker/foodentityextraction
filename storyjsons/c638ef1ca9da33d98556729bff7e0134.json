These herbs are tools to protect against fire season, an annual necessity since nearby Santa Rosa was devastated by a series of wildfires in 2017.In 2020, over 3.5 million acres have burned in California alone\u2014and brush fires continue to rage across the state and Oregon. The unprecedented scale of blazes sweeping across the West Coast, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic, has infused new urgency into lung protection. Mutual aid organizations are stocking community fridges with free herb bundles, and herbalists are sharing tutorials for how to steam kitchen herbs like rosemary and thyme.Five Flavors Herbs\u2019 cofounders, Ingrid Bauer, M.D., and husband and licensed acupuncturist-herbalist Benjamin Zappin, experienced the blaze firsthand. \u201cWe evacuated from our home here in Nevada City in mid-August when the Jones fire broke out a half mile from our house,\u201d Bauer says. \u201cWhen we came home, we experienced a couple weeks of very intense smoke from the Loyalton Fire and North Complex Fire.\u201dBauer and Zappin relied heavily on their herbal knowledge throughout the ordeal. Here, they share their best tips for using plant allies to cope with the effects of fire season.Make a cold-water extractionWhen the air is really filled with hot particulate matter, mucilaginous herbs like mullein, marshmallow root, and licorice root are useful tools for soothing irritated respiratory tissue. And no, they don\u2019t have anything to do with mucus.\u201cAt a biochemical level, mucilaginous herbs have a high content of something called mucopolysaccharides, which is a long chain sugar that forms a goopy material in liquid,\u201d Bauer says. \u201c[Drinking them] will soothe both the respiratory and digestive tracts, which is helpful if your stomach is burning or irritated because you\u2019re stressed out or not eating the ideal diet while evacuated.\u201dMucilages are a great candidate to brew at home because they can be extracted in cold water with very little effort. Put a heaping tablespoon of dry shredded marshmallow root into a quart jar, cover it with cold water, and soak overnight. In the morning strain the thick liquid and drink it, sweetened with a bit of honey if you like.Target your sinuses\u201cMy main problem was sinus congestion and allergic response to all the dust and smoke in the air,\u201d Bauer says. \u201cI was using a neti pot with a saltwater rinse and taking allergy-support herbs to reduce reactivity in the airway, like ambrosia (Editor\u2019s note: It is also known as ragweed\u2014beware if you\u2019re allergic!) and a tincture blend that we make with that called Clear Passage. Sometimes, if things are really congested, I\u2019ll put a few drops into the neti pot along with the salt water.\u201dSteam smartlyHerbal steams are one of the most popular forms of plant-based respiratory support being shared online right now. Whether you\u2019re using a diffuser, humidifier, or simply boiling a pot of water on the stove, the essential oils in plants like thyme and eucalyptus can help loosen up the phlegm so your body can naturally cough it out\u2014and the steam is hydrating too.Stovetop steaming is perhaps the easiest method to nourish lungs. Fill a large pot with water and your preferred herbs, then boil. Bauer and Zappin recommend enlisting common herbs like rosemary, thyme, and eucalyptus\u2014check a grocery store, or look for a local herbal mutual aid organization that might be coordinating deliveries of herb bundles, like Portland-based Herbs for Activists.Let the steam fill your room, or carefully drape a towel over your head to directly inhale for five minutes. \u201cYou have to be very careful not to burn yourself, especially if you\u2019re using a towel as a tent over your head,\u201d Bauer says. Make sure the water is turned off and test the steam temperature with your hand before putting your face over the pot. Avoid this technique if you have asthma or weakened lungs as the essential oils can be intense.Consider an oxymelOxymel\u2014literally \u201cacid and honey\u201d in ancient Greek\u2014is an herbal tonic made by infusing vinegar and honey with a wide variety of dried or fresh herbs, from parsley and thyme to ginger and garlic. Five Flavors Herbs has this recipe designed to support lungs with dried elecampane root, wild cherry bark, and mullein. \u201cElecampane is an important herb to highlight because it\u2019s a wonderful respiratory support herb and expectorant to loosen up the phlegm\u2014its warm and spicy flavor profile helps cut through,\u201d Bauer says.Use herbs for your emotional health too\u201cDealing with a fire on top of COVID-19, everyone is really concerned, and it amplifies that sense of vulnerability,\u201d Zappin says. He cites adaptogens as a useful way to cope with emotional distress while strengthening the body\u2019s response to particulate matter, the microscopic matter found in smoke. \u201cI find adaptogens like rhodiola, cordyceps, and holy basil really useful because they benefit respiration and aid in the body\u2019s ability to get more oxygen,\u201d he says.In addition to seeking a boost from plant medicine, consider enlisting some help to wind down. \u201cDuring the week of evacuation, I leaned on my emergency nervines, like skullcap and kava kava,\u201d Bauer says. \u201cI used sleep herbs at night, like valerian and hops, because it was very difficult to sleep when you\u2019re that worried about what might be happening to your neighbors and your home.\u201dBut start with one, and source with careHerb blends, often found in tinctures, provide a cumulative effect with very little effort, but it\u2019s best to start using plant medicine strategically. \u201cIf people are trying out herbal medicine for the first time, go for individual extractions so you can get a sense of what each herb does,\u201d Bauer says. \u201cExperiment with a marshmallow cold infusion or a licorice tea or elecampane oxymel.\u201d If you\u2019re taking medications, check with your doctor or herbal practitioner to be sure there aren\u2019t any contraindications or negative interactions.Many kitchen herbs, like rosemary and culinary sage, can be grown at home or purchased from a grocery store. Look for other plant medicine at local herb shops or small-scale growers, or source blends online through this BIPOC herbalist directory. \u201cIf you\u2019re shopping online, look for certified organic and domestically grown if possible,\u201d Bauer says. \u201cIt\u2019s really cheap to buy herbs in bulk, so get together with your community or neighbors to buy some pounds of marshmallow root.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSelf CareInterviewsRead MoreLifestyleThe Herbal Mutual Aid Network Creates Free Tinctures for Black OrganizersBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
