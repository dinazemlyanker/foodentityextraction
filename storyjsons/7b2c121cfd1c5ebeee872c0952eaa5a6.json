Follow her progress on Instagram @PKgourmet.These days, being a vegetarian is no big deal. Restaurant menus always have a meat-free entr\u00e9e. No waiter will be offended if you check that the fries weren\u2019t cooked in beef fat.Back in the \u201990s, however, when my mom was taking bi-weekly trips to London for her job developing software for airlines, it was a cold and unfriendly world. Her requests for meatless food at restaurants and pubs were largely met with scoffs. And if there was a vegetarian option, nine times out of ten, it was a baked potato.So my mom learned to subsist on the humble spud during her work trips. She got used to the routine of heading to the pub closest to her hotel, ordering a baked potato, and topping it with sour cream, salt, and pepper (and, if she remembered to pack it in her carry-on, a sprinkling of bottled masala). She\u2019d eat it with a side of baked beans and a beer and be on her way.For whatever reason, my mom never got sick of baked potatoes. In fact, at home in Dallas, she\u2019d make baked potatoes for our family when she was feeling too lazy to put a pot of dal on the stove. It was easy, and we always had potatoes in the house, since I\u2019m certain that no one stans potatoes like Indian vegetarians. (What\u2019s not to like? They\u2019re filling, they hold onto seasonings well, and they can be prepared in limitless ways.)But my mom didn\u2019t top our potatoes with sour cream, salt, and pepper. Being at home meant she could get a little more creative. She\u2019d adorn our spuds with the ingredients we regularly kept in our fridge: red onion, ginger, cilantro, green chilies (everything finely chopped), and the funky spice blend, chaat masala\u2014plus, sour cream (she couldn\u2019t resist).Aside from sour cream, I grew up totally unfamiliar with traditional baked potato toppings like those artificial-tasting bacon bits, or that stiff, pre-grated cheddar cheese. My baked potatoes were sharp and spicy, with fresh ingredients and varied textures. Eventually, my mom moved beyond the standard russet and started baking baby new potatoes and serving them sliced open like flowers for an easy party appetizer.Baked potato bites, ready to party.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Dana BonaguraOver the last decade, baked potatoes have fallen out of fashion in American food culture\u2014I\u2019m not sure why. I guess people perceive potatoes as empty carbs and starch, and if they\u2019re going to have a potato, they might as well have it in fried form. When it comes to my mom\u2019s Indian-ish baked potato, I respectfully disagree.I love the way baking a potato turns its innards into silky tufts. I love watching the sour cream melt into the flesh. I love how intensely the flavors of the ginger and the chaat masala imprint themselves. I love crunching the red onions (do not fear raw onions, people!) and getting that creeping heat from the chilies.But I love it most of all when I serve the dish in its baby potato form at parties. People look at the colorful, dainty morsels and think I spent all this time putting together a fancy appetizer plate when in reality, it\u2019s just a baked potato.Follow this basic recipe for the baked potato, and then doctor it up with Priya\u2019s suggestions above.You can pre-order Priya\u2019s upcoming cookbook Indian-ish on Amazon for $23.
