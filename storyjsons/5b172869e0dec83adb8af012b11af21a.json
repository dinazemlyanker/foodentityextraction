You should see my toe-touching. It\u2019s enviable, I think. Not that anyone has ever envied it, but I like to imagine they would, if they knew.This is to say that I was primed to like Stretch*d, a boutique Flatiron stretching studio nestled between a high-tech nail salon and a sex club with bad Yelp reviews. It is the rare boutique fitness experience that demands no motivation and causes no sweat. Instead you lie on a very comfortable table while a professional Stretch*r moves your body around for you. It\u2019s a cross between exercising and being a corpse. (This is a compliment.)The problem is, people don\u2019t stretch enough, Amanda Freeman tells me. She knows this, because before co-founding Stretch*d, she founded the hardcore boutique fitness method SLT\u2014as in strengthen, lengthen, and tone\u2014and noticed that half the class would leave before the final stretch. \u201cI\u2019d even hear instructors say, \u2018...if you have time for the stretch,\u2019 as if it\u2019s something very secondary you could skip,\u201d she says. But when you see people working with personal trainers at the gym, \u201cyou\u2019ll notice them relishing the last five to ten minutes when they\u2019re being stretched out.\u201dPeople know they\u2019re supposed to stretch, but they don\u2019t. \u201cIt\u2019s like the flossing of fitness,\u201d co-founder Vanessa Chu told Ashley Mateo at The Cut last year, something you feel vaguely guilty about not doing as much as you\u2019re supposed to, but not so guilty that you change. As Freeman sees it, this is for two reasons. One is that stretching does not come with a \u201csuperficial benefit, like calorie burn or weight loss,\u201d and people like immediate results. The other is that self-stretching\u2014which is to say the usual kind, where you\u2019re responsible for holding your own ankle\u2014feels tedious. You do a whole workout, and then there\u2019s more?Stretch*d, though, wants to turn stretching into the main event. \u201cI think assisted stretch is better because it feels amazing,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s like giving yourself a shoulder rub versus having someone else do it for you.\u201d It\u2019s supposed to feel like luxury but also boost athletic performance, release stress, and reduce the risk of injury. It\u2019s not fitness, exactly; it\u2019s pampering with benefits.In person, Stretch*d is pleasantly non-intimidating, which is to say that I wore my only pair of brand-name workout leggings and no one cared. There are (I think) no candles and no gongs and no pretense of spiritual healing. Nobody uses the phrase \u201cwellness\u201d the whole time I am there. Nobody says I will become sexier. For a one-on-one boutique stretching experience that costs $100 for 55 minutes, it all feels very practical, like going to the allergist.The room where it happens.\nPhoto by Alex LauMy Stretch*r for the hour, Jeff Brannigan, leads me back to one of Stretch*d\u2019s eight semi-private rooms, each of which is equipped with an adjustable massage table with a seatbelt on it. Brannigan asks if I have any injuries, but I don\u2019t, which feels like a let down. He developed the company\u2019s proprietary method and now serves as its program director, so I feel like I should have more specialized pain, but I have only the general pain of being alive. \u201cMy shoulders are tense, I think!\u201d I offer, and then he adjusts the belt around my hips. He moves my limbs through a series of stretches, which involve him pushing and/or pulling various parts of my body in slow and methodical ways, and me becoming increasingly self-conscious about the dog hair on my socks.\u201cI\u2019m sorry about the dog hair on my socks,\u201d I say, as he pushes my leg up toward my head. \u201cDo you have a dog?\u201d he asks.He moves my legs up, over, to the side. He adjusts the table up, and down, and up; undoes the belt, adjusts the belt, redoes the belt. He presses on the palm of my hand and the sensation up my arm is so intense I gasp. \u201cYeah, that one surprises people,\u201d he observes. He moves my back. He moves my shoulders. The ceiling is decorated with are stretch-related idioms. Above me it reads, \u201cLoose Plans.\u201dThey\u2019re good stretches, I think. I mean, I am no stretch-spert, but I feel like my muscles are becoming less tense and more lengthened. Brannigan checks in regularly to make sure I\u2019m doing okay, and I assure him I am, and then we return to a comfortable silence, and I close my eyes are return to eavesdropping on the woman being stretch*d one stall over, who is talking about running marathons. Should I run marathons? I wonder, luxuriating in the experience of having someone else manipulate my limbs for me. (No.)Brannigan whips out a machine called the HyperVolt, which is a massager that looks like a power drill and feels like you\u2019re being pelted with violent hale. But, like, in a healing way. Under normal circumstances, it costs an extra 5 dollars and is nice, mostly, until we encounter a tender spot on my inner thigh, and then it is excruciating. We decide that this is because I am tense, which is either from working out or being sedentary. Then he slathers my neck with CBD cream (also 5 dollars), which is supposed to reduce inflammation. \u201cIs that because necks get very inflamed?\u201d I ask. He says it\u2019s mostly because it would be weird to start massaging cream on clients other places, and I appreciate his honesty.I feel great when I leave. The change is less physical than mental, like the extra space in my body has created extra space in my brain.The extremely on-trend Stretch*d store\nPhoto by Alex LauStretch*d is part of a whole boutique fitness movement focused on recovery. \u201cThat\u2019s what sets athletes like Tom Brady apart,\u201d one exercise physiologist told Mateo. \u201cIt\u2019s not how hard he trains, it\u2019s how hard he recovers.\u201d This is very inspiring, but I am not Tom Brady. For one thing, I don\u2019t train very hard at all. But Freeman assures me that Stretch*d is for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s not just for the fitness-obsessed. We have clients who sit all day and have a bad back or neck or their wrist really hurts from texting a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just basically recovery from our everyday life. Our bodies weren\u2019t necessarily intended to sit at a desk eight hours a day, or to do HIIT four days a week. But we\u2019ve evolved so that\u2019s where our lifestyle is now.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t hit me until now how depressing this is, that the thing we\u2019re all supposed to be recovering from might just be the unrelenting strain of being alive. That, were it not comped because of this article, I would be spending $100 to have a professional relieve the pressure of my own physical existence. Should we be worried about this?But this is not Stretchd\u2019s fault. Stretchd is just responding to the circumstances that are. And they\u2019re right. I do text. I hunch over a laptop, and then I go to the gym to try to make up for it, and while I could try to change all that, it seems much easier to have a nice trained professional twist my legs for a while.You don\u2019t need a Stretch*r to stretch. But, for me, the benefit of Stretch*d isn\u2019t really about the stretching. It\u2019s that, for an hour, you are required to make no decisions at all. At home, alone, stretching is a constant set of questions: Should you stretch? What stretch? For how long? Are you doing it right? Are you sure? But at Stretch*d, there are no decisions, except that you have to show up. You can\u2019t make a bad choice, because there are no choices. It is a 55-minute (or 25-minute, or 75 minute) vacation from responsibility and nobody even gets mad at you for it, because sure, it\u2019s indulgence, but it\u2019s also enrichment, like a nature cruise instead of Tulum. And you don\u2019t even have to keep track of the precise whereabouts of your legs.Explore Bon App\u00e9titI Did the ThingHealthyishessayRead MoreLifestyleI Tried 'Wellness Coworking' and It Made Me Feel Profoundly AloneBy Rachel Sugar Recipes you want to make.
