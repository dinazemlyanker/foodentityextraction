Inspired by the classic Thai soup tom kha gai, this version has pieces of salmon instead of chicken and uses easy-to-find ginger instead of traditional galangal root. (If you have access to galangal, though, by all means use it!) Fresh lime juice adds a bright, tangy finish that balances out the richness of the coconut broth. Try serving it with vermicelli noodles for a heartier meal. \u2014Diana YenAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

One serrano chili gave little heat, so I'll use two next time.  I used 2T of Gourmet Garden lemongrass paste for ease of preparation.  Added 3 carrots to the onion and garlic.  2 cups chicken broth was a bit too thick so I'll use 3 cups next time.  ~3 oz. spinach at the end.  My wife loved it - this recipe is definitely a keeper.Go4JugularLake Oswego, OR1/23/2022This is a great soup!  I increased the ginger, lemon grass and lime juice.  I think the water is a must for this recipe.   I also added chicken and galangal root along with the salmon\u2026\u2026yummy Stacy  Escondido California 1/23/2022this one should be revised to either be clearer about how finely to cut the lemongrass or perhaps to grate it instead.  I tried to cut it like the picture shows and I'm stuck with a lot of very woody bits.\n\nadditionally, I think reducing the stock a little more or replacing some of the water with stock would go a long way to make it much more flavorful.maxbrooklyn1/19/2022Outstanding recipe, very true to Thai original, lots of chopping, slicing and dicing, but well worth the effort.  Delicious use of a lot of expensive salmon, the only waste being the skin.  Husband loved it, will be making this one again.LaTigressePortland, OR1/17/2022My whole family (except for my tremendously picky brother, who didn't try it) loved this recipe. I substituted the mixed mushrooms for dried white fungus because that was all I had, the fish sauce for soy sauce, and added some thinly sliced radishes and celery to the garlic and onion. It turned out delicious!AnonymousLondon, UK1/10/2022After reading the reviews I was a little nervous it wouldn\u2019t taste good, but made some modifications and it came out great! I basically halved the salmon (I\u2019m 1 person) and the amount of liquid, 1 1/2 cup bone broth, 1/2 cup water and 1 can coconut milk, and pretty much kept the same amount for all other ingredients. Then added a tbsp of homemade yellow curry  paste and tsp of yellow curry powder, added great flavor! Makes for a bit of a thicker soup but came out delicious! Kalli K.Darby, Montana 1/5/2022I make this same soup but only with chicken -- we don't care for salmon.  A couple of tips -- instead of using plain water, use Better Than Bouillon chicken stock to make broth.  Also, to make it a more complete meal, I peel and slice a few carrots and add along with the onion and ginger.   A couple of minutes before serving, I add a couple of handfuls of fresh spinach and let it simmer just until spinach is winter.  Everybody loves it and wants the recipe.Nancy SDenver, CO1/5/2022Don\u2019t believe the number of stars\u2026 this is a dud! Completely tasteless! What a waste of my time! Horrible - walk away\u2026 AnonymousSonoma, CA10/5/2021Absolutely delicious. I've shared this recipe with friends and family, Universally loved. \nWinner of there is nutritional info such as calories. Suzanne Levin Pleasant Ridge, MI 9/22/2021LOVED THIS. I made some adjustments based on the reviews - I did NOT use water (why would you even suggest that?) I was going to use fish stock, but local wegmans had \u201cThai stock\u201d so I used 1 cup + the 2 cans of coconut milk and after reducing it was thick and delicious. I also added 2 tbs of red curry paste, crisped up the mushrooms first & doubled the lime juice. Served over cilantro lime rice and it\u2019s absolutely delicious! xtristatex Lancaster pa 8/22/2021Bad bad bad\u2026 this is not what they tell you it is\u2026 not remotely like Tom Kai Ga - made it as instructed but did reduce water by half, thank fully. If full water called for this would have been the biggest waste of $24/lb salmon. This is a bad recipe!PegmatSonoma CA7/31/2021I didn't read the reviews until I was \u00be done with the recipe (wish I had) but it turned out really really delicious, nonetheless. I instinctively cooked the broth (coconut milk, water and aromatics) a lot longer than the recipe called for to get the right texture and flavor. The mushrooms do cook faster than the salmon, I will toss them in a little earlier next time I make this. I was very liberal with cilantro and lime juice to finish. Overall, it was a pretty addictive soup. Probably won't use habanero peppers next time (!) but they were all I had. Maybe because I had a heavy hand with lemongrass and other flavors, this soup was FAR from bland for me. honeybee130667/23/2021i have a big dilemma :) I would like to cook this soup for my husband but i have no idea which kind of second plate and dessert are passed beside it.\n\nAre there any suggestion from somebody? :)OrsheBarcelona, Spain7/5/2021I made this exactly as directed and it was DELICIOUS!! Thank you.  I also want to suggest that the star rating does correctly record the number each person chooses, it is just that there are so many high ratings, that factoring in each choice keeps the equation at 5.keep tryingCalifornia5/15/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titSoupSoups and StewsThaiSoutheast AsianAsianCoconut MilkOther IngredientsSalmonFishSeafoodMushroomVegetableLemongrassHerbs & SpicesOne-Pot MealsMainGluten-FreeDairy-FreeKetoSimmerDinnerBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
