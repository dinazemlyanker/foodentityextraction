Having friends over gives me a chance to experiment with cooking ambitious dishes for a more-receptive- than-usual audience (i.e., humans other than my kids). But feeding a group of people is never as simple as putting out food and expecting everyone to happily demolish it. Between picky kids and picky adults, food allergies and special diets, there\u2019s always going to be someone who can\u2019t eat spicy foods and someone else who\u2019s avoiding meat/gluten/dairy/all of the above.So how to feed a crowd so everyone leaves happy? I start with mounds of pillowy homemade hummus, which makes a fantastic foundation for an epic late-summer feast. I saute\u0301 colorful summer squash with warm spices (which mask this unpopular vegetable\u2019s true identity from my kids) and crisp up some garlicky ground lamb for protein and texture but not heaviness. Lots of toasted pita for scooping up everything is nonnegotiable.I can guarantee that if I were to pile the squash and lamb on top of the hummus and finish the whole thing off with fistfuls of herbs, my kids would leave the table and never come back\u2014and at least a few adults I know would be stuck eating things they\u2019d prefer not to. Instead, I put out the hummus and all the toppings in separate bowls and let everyone serve themselves exactly how they like. And if garlicky lamb crumbles aren\u2019t for you, well, pass the bowl to me, please.Get the recipe:Hummus with Spiced Summer Squash and LambLots of toasted pita for scooping up everything is nonnegotiable.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPicky Eaters\u2019 ClubHummusLambSummer SquashRead MorecookingFor a Kid-Friendly Cacio e Pepe, Just Add CornBy Deb PerelmancookingThese Spinach Artichoke Melts Are Where Dip Meets Grilled CheeseBy Deb PerelmancookingNo Picky Eater Wants to Eat Broccoli\u2014Until You Add KetchupBy Deb PerelmancookingA Cheesy, Bready Dinner to Please the Pickiest Eaters in Your HouseholdBy Deb PerelmanRecipes you want to make.
