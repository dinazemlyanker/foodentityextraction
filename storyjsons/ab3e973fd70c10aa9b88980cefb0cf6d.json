Hope Brooklyn12/27/2020I have made this for many events and it's fabulous every time. It's so easy! I typically add more garlic for extra zing (having dragon breath for the rest of the evening is worth it). It's great on everything: crackers, bread, soft pretzels, raw vegetables - I have one friend who will even  add a little to her scrambled eggs. Suggestion: if you make it ahead of time and store it in the fridge I recommend letting it sit out a bit before so it softens up and is more easily spread/dipped. AnonymousAustin, Tx4/30/2020I found this too be a bit too thick to be considered a dip. However, it is the perfect consistency to spread on a hearty bread (I spread mine on pretzel focaccia). You can definitely up the amount of cayenne if you want any spice at all.
