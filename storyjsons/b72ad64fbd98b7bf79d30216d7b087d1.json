Probably should have added more salt and done more of the shallots, maybe add some jalapeno too as someone else suggested. I subbed a mix of quinoa and green, brown & black lentils for the grains in the recipe as my wife if gluten free which worked fine. Might try again with some of the other recommended subs/adds.fitzrobAustin, TX8/7/2020As someone else in the comments suggested, I riffed on this a little (had no lime juice, subbed rice vinegar; had no shallots, subbed a bit of yellow onion; subbed mustard for mustard seed; added an island spice mix in addition to turmeric; didn't have or want cucumber so swapped in roasted sweet potato). It was delicious and a very satisfying breakfast. The crispy egg was the right texture to go with this. emonydaxmadison, wi1/1/2020Good vegetarian weeknight meal! Made exactly as described and loved it. I think it can easily be riffed on too- sweet potatoes, roasted broccoli or cauliflower, zuchinni, etc could easily be swapped for the cucumber. The only thing we'd change is adding two eggs per person instead of one. yum!AnonymousChicago10/29/2019I had some aging watercress and arugula in the fridge, so used greens instead of the cucumbers and mixed with the grains while they were still warm to wilt them a bit.  I also added some jalapenos to the shallot mixture for a little heat.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and it was DELICIOUS!  Even my husband who is not a vegetarian said it's a keeper.  Easy weeknight meal, and could easily be modified with whatever veggies you have on hand.  I will definitely make this again!  AnonymousMadison, VA3/12/2019Wasn't keen on cucumbers with my eggs for some reason so swapped them for some roasted sweet potato wedges. Perfectly satisfying, and easy for a weeknight.nah270Philadelphia1/15/2019This dish was pretty good. It seemed maybe a bit too basic on first glance, and even when we sat down to eat I was less than impressed. I ended up clearing my plate though. We both agreed that the flavors started to shine when the dish had cooled off a bit... not sure what to make of that. My shallots didn't really crisp up, which I think was operator error. I'll try using a bit less fat and maybe turning the heat a bit higher if I try again?austin738257923840921/13/2019I really like this dish. It's easy, fresh, and the flavors are beautiful. I love the crispy eggs, and I think the cucumbers go well with the lime and cilantro and make it nice and fresh. I also really like that it can be eaten cold or warm, which makes it great to eat for lunch the next day. AnonymousAL1/5/2019This swish was so easy and delicious! I will definitely cook more shallots and garlic next time because the flavor was amazing with the two spices. Definitely would make again! AnonymousChicago1/3/2019Not a huge fan of the cucumbers in this dish. If I were to make it again, I would sub out some sauteed zucchini or, if I wanted something fresh, halved cherry tomatoes. Otherwise, the flavors are beautiful.AnonymousQueens12/29/2018straight forward instructions, complex flavors - ALL I COULD EVER ASK FOR.HvrrysheehanBrooklyn12/29/2018Crispy eggs----ugh!!!!AnonymousPennsylvania12/28/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titFreekehRice & GrainsFarroBarleyEggQuickWeeknight MealsMainDairy-FreeVegetarianHealthyishSimmerFryLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
