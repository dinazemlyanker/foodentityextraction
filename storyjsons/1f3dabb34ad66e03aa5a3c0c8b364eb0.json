In this version of a Proven\u00e7al classic, a whole leg of lamb is braised low and slow with a few aromatics and some dry wine until the meat is so tender you could eat it with a spoon\u2014in fact, this dish is commonly known as gigot \u00e0 la cuill\u00e8re (or \u201cspoon lamb\u201d) in France.A popular mainstay on the table of Peppler\u2019s Parisian home, this succulent lamb is paired with a vibrant green, garlicky persillade, providing a sharp counterpoint to the rich meat. Serve with cheesy new potatoes and a citrusy radish salad for a well-rounded meal. Any leftover lamb can be deliciously repurposed in sandwiches with bitter greens and plenty of mayo.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.
