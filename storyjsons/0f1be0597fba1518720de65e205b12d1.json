From Bon Jovi\u2019s Hampton Water ros\u00e9 to Boyz II Men\u2019s Harmony label, musicians, athletes, and actors are slapping their names on bottles faster than you can say, \u201cAlthough we\u2019ve come to the end of the road, still I can\u2019t let go.\u201d But are any of these celebrity wines actually worth buying? Much of that has to do with which winemaker the celeb chooses to partner with, because we\u2019re pretty sure Cameron Diaz is not determining which pruning techniques to employ for her \u201cclean\u201d vegan wine brand. When the juice is good\u2014as in the case of designer Rosie Assoulin\u2019s Vivanterre wines, which are produced by natural wine heavy hitters Patrick Bouju and Justine Loiseau\u2014it\u2019s because the A-lister lending their name to the brand has had the good sense to tap a legit expert. Below, sommelier Andr\u00e9 Mack weighs in on three celebrity wines that deserve a spot on your table\u2014and for his dunks on the bottles that didn\u2019t make the cut (sorry, Snoop), watch the full video below.Three by Wade Blanc by Dwyane WadeOf all the celebrity wines tasted, Three by Wade wins Mack\u2019s top spot. It\u2019s a California white wine\u2014specifically, 95% Chenin Blanc with a smidgen of Viognier. Chenin Blanc, most often associated with wines from the Loire Valley, is a versatile grape with good acid that Mack says, \u201call the cool kids are drinking these days.\u201d For his label, Wade has partnered with Napa winemaker Jayson Pahlmeyer. \u201cHe has serious people on his team,\u201d Mack notes. \u201cThese are real \u2018wine legend\u2019 people.\u201d Three by Wade is refreshing and aromatic with notes of honeydew melon, honeysuckle, and a hint of chamomile on the nose. \u201cIt\u2019s a great expression of Chenin Blanc in America,\u201d says Mack. \u201cThis is wine for people who want to experiment with something different.\u201dEmoji Rating: \u201cThree basketballs \ud83c\udfc0\ud83c\udfc0\ud83c\udfc0, because this one is ballin\u2019\u201dThree by Wade Blanc$21 at Wine.comLicataa Lambrusco by Raekwon the ChefThis is a Lambrusco\u2014a sparkling red wine from the Emilia-Romagna region of Northern Italy\u2014by Raekwon of the Wu-Tang Clan. \u201cLambrusco gives you all of the benefits of red wine, but it\u2019s served chilled and has a little bit of frizzante, which kind of acts like a scrubbing pad on your palate,\u201d says Mack. Licataa has an earthy aroma with good tannins and notes of blueberry, raspberry, strawberry, and black currant on the palate. Mack deems it luxurious, multidimensional, and a great pairing for charcuterie boards. \u201cQuality-wise, it\u2019s in the top tier of Lambruscos,\u201d he says. \u201cThis feels like Raekwon to me. The easy thing would have been to go to Champagne, but to go to a different region [for sparkling wine] shows an exploratory side, a resourcefulness.\u201d The flashy blue bottle and its fuzzy velvet top makes Licataa a stunner.Emoji Rating: \u201cSmiley face with stars in the eyes\u201dLicataa Lambrusco$30 at Verve WineSun Goddess Pinot Grigio by Mary J. BligeMack calls this out as a \u201cgreat quality wine\u201d for its price point. Pinot Grigio originates in the Friuli region in Northern Italy. If you\u2019re wondering why this wine isn\u2019t exactly white in color, that\u2019s because it\u2019s made in a traditional style called ramato, whereby the skin of the crushed grapes macerates in the juice producing a beautiful orange color and a more complex, dimensional liquid. Sun Goddess has a floral aroma with notes of peach, nectarine, and cantaloupe. \u201cThe skin contact gives this wine texture and soul,\u201d says Mack. \u201cMary J. didn\u2019t invent this technique, but I think the fact that she was willing to work with someone who was doing this is cool, and I respect that. It feels authentic to me.\u201dEmoji Rating: \u201cLoudspeaker or megaphone \ud83d\udce3, because I want everybody to know about it\u201dSun Goddess Pinot Grigio$20 at Wine.comExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingLifestyleRecipes you want to make.
