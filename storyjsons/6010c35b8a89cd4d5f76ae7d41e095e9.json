Very boozy. Love, Ma.\u201dIn mid-March I went to Texas to attend a wedding and ended up staying for three months. I was an adult woman living at home for the first time since high school. This time around I was less angsty and of legal drinking age. So my parents started doing regular happy hours. This meant that my mom would make a cocktail and my dad would put out a cheese board. I don\u2019t know how they landed on this series of events. I guess my mom loves experimenting with drinks and my dad spends a lot of time browsing the cheese selection at Costco.We settled into a rhythm: On weekday afternoons, as soon as my mom started playing Rodrigo y Gabriela downstairs, I knew it was time to shut my laptop. At a time when anxiety felt inescapable, the happy hours were my constant\u2014an activity I could look forward to. A distraction from being stuck in one place, seeing only the same people.Photo by Mackenzie KelleySometimes my mom would make a cocktail\u2014a margarita, a Negroni, a cosmopolitan\u2014loosely following a recipe, and definitely not measuring anything. Other times we\u2019d have triple IPAs from our local Odd Muse Brewing Company. Very often our drinks had no booze at all\u2014Topo Chico with lemon, or shikanji, a salt-and-pepper limeade. Some days the \u201ccheese plate\u201d would be a single hunk of feta, paired with a lengthy story from my dad about how he acquired the knife he used to cut it.It\u2019s unsettling, moving home after living on your own for years. I don\u2019t have a perfect relationship with my parents. But in those happy hours, I understood the distinct privilege of this found time with my family\u2014and of even having a family, a home, and a job during quarantine.When I got back to New York, I had planned to restart the tradition in my own apartment with my partner. But I couldn\u2019t do it. That ritual belongs to my parents and me.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCocktailCheeseCharcuterieCoronavirusRead MorecultureIf I\u2019m Cutting Fresh Fruit for Dessert, I Probably Love YouBy Priya KrishnaRecipes you want to make.
