Things are going to be different from now on.By Amiel StanekJuly 26, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Amy WilsonFacebookTwitterEmailA few weeks back, in honor of my dear friend Max\u2019s birthday, I made this new recipe for Pork Shoulder Steaks with Grilled Mustard Greens from the June/July issue of Bon App\u00e9tit. And in order to fully grasp the unspeakable glory of this dish, I need you to go to an Imaginative Place with me. Cool? Cool.Picture the biggest, meatiest pork chop you\u2019ve ever seen, hot off the grill and blessed with the most magnificent of crusty-smoky sears. As you start slicing it into wide, wobbly, perfectly-pink ribbons, you whistle quietly to yourself\u2014each slice is zebra-striped with beautiful striations of sweet, sweet pork fat, marbling like you\u2019ve never seen, guaranteeing that each and every bite will be as juicy and porky as the last. Your friends come to investigate once they catch wind of what\u2019s going on in the kitchen, and when you sneak them a bite they moan with pleasure. \u201cWhat kind of pork chop IS THIS?\u201d They demand. And that\u2019s when you drop the bomb.\u201cThis actually isn\u2019t a pork chop at all\u2014it\u2019s a pork shoulder steak. And it\u2019s twice as delicious and half as expensive as any pork chop you have had or ever will have. Things are going to be different from now on.\u201dSee, the thing about this recipe is that it\u2019s more than \u201creally, really good,\u201d it\u2019s paradigm-shifting. It is bold and it is brash and it will make you a better cooker of meats and a better consumer of pork. Here\u2019s why.First, there\u2019s the dry rub. If you\u2019re not on board with the whole marinades-are-mostly-bullshit, dry-rubs-rule thing, this should convince you. Instead of bathing the pork in some messy mixture of different liquids that aren\u2019t ever going to penetrate beyond the surface of the meat, you rub it down with a crushed up mixture of toasted fennel seeds, mustard seeds, peppercorns, and cinnamon that form the basis of an intensely aromatic, complex crust. Nice!Then there\u2019s the cut. Unlike your classic pork chop, which is cut from the loin of the pig, these pork shoulder steaks are cut from a hunk of boneless shoulder, aka Boston Butt. (Fair warning: You\u2019re probably not going to find these packaged and ready to go in the pork section of the supermarket. Which means you need to either a) ask your butcher to cut \u00be-inch steaks from a Boston Butt or b) buy a Boston Butt and cut it against the grain into said \u00be-inch steaks yourself, which is really not a big deal.) It\u2019s an extremely affordable cut that most people cook low-and-slow until it\u2019s fall apart tender and shreddy\u2014think pulled pork and carnitas\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean that it has to be cooked that way. It has a lot of intramuscular fat, often referred to as \u201cmarbling,\u201d which means it takes well to hot-and-fast grilling the same way a ribeye steak does, juicy and full of meaty flavor.Another great pork shoulder steak recipe, cooked in a cast iron instead of on the grill. Try it!\nPeden + MunkAnd then, to top it all off, there\u2019s the temperature. You are absolutely forbidden to cook these pork shoulder steaks past a juicy-pink medium\u2014that\u2019s what you need to do in order to ensure that they\u2019re tender and flavorful. If you cook these pork shoulder steaks all the way to well done, they\u2019ll be dry and gross. No, you won\u2019t get sick if you stop cooking them at 145; the worst thing that\u2019s going to happen is that you\u2019re going to feel sick to your stomach thinking about all the times you overcooked pork in your life. Pink pork = living.So...yeah. Buy some pork shoulder steaks. Rub them down with fragrant spices and plenty of salt. Grill them over medium for five to seven minutes until they\u2019re crusty on the outside and irresistibly pink and juicy on the inside. Grill some marinated mustard greens afterwards to serve as a side, if you want. And get ready to have your summer grilling turned upside down.Get the recipe:Pork Shoulder Steaks with Grilled Mustard GreensNormally you want to braise a pork shoulder\u2014but we\u2019re making a case for throwing it on the grill, with a hell of a spice rub.View Recipe4 more recipes starring pork shoulder steaks:Maple-Habanero Glazed Pork SteaksBefore you panic about the habaneros\u2014we've got a trick in this recipe that mellows out the spice.
