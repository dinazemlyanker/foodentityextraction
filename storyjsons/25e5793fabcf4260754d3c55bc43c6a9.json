He uses the resulting mixture to poach shrimp, though the flavored ghee would also be great spooned over any lean protein such as chicken or fish.

The spicy ghee is a must that really elevates the dish. You can use it for many other dishes so make a little extra. Shrimp, polenta or ghee fried rice; what could go wrong? \n\nI make this so much that I have the recipe memorized.
