Villarosa\u2019s twin griddles allow him to cook with comfort just about anywhere. Though we\u2019ve all made a stack of \u2019jacks on the handy, portable appliance, in these videos Villarosa completely reimagines their use, employing one more traditionally as a flattop for direct cooking and the other in place of a burner for pots and pans.What\u2019s better than one griddle? Two griddles.\nVillarosa\u2019s griddle love runs deep. \u201cFive years ago I started working with students in New York City to teach them how to cook. The Department of Education wouldn\u2019t let us use the cafeteria kitchens, so I had to create mobile kitchens in school libraries and auditoriums,\u201d he explains. So he gathered equipment for his teaching kitchens: a cutting board, an immersion blender, and two electric pancake griddles that could stand in for the flattop grills that are an essential part of professional kitchens.\u201cThese griddles sear perfectly,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you cook salmon skin on it, it becomes super crispy. I\u2019ve done a lot on this thing\u2014charred onions and steak, a whole fish.\u201d Anything you\u2019d cook on a flattop, Baking Steel, or cast-iron griddle you can cook on Harold\u2019s Presto. Smash burgers, breakfast fare, grilled cheese\u2014all fair game.Presto Slimline Griddle$56 at Amazon$76 at TargetBut there\u2019s more to the griddle than searing and crisping. Villarosa uses them as he would a stovetop, in place of a portable gas or induction burner. \u201cIf you have a pancake griddle and turn the heat up to the highest setting, you can put pots on that hot flattop.\u201d In his steak okonomiyaki video, the chef uses the griddle as a heating surface for his nonstick frying pan, in which he cooks the okonomiyaki pancake. In the grilled cheese video, he braises his chicken adobo in a heavy-bottomed saucepan set atop the Presto. He has even put it to work making an entire pasta dinner with the students. Together they boiled handmade agnolotti stuffed with butternut squash in one pot and finished them with a sage and brown butter sauce in another, all on the griddle.Villarosa recommends electric griddles to anyone who might be cooking in a nontraditional kitchen but still has access to a power source\u2014students who don\u2019t want to fight for space in the communal dorm kitchen, homeowners waiting out a kitchen renovation, or even apartment dwellers waiting for their gas to be turned on. He also thinks griddle cooking could benefit anyone who does have access to a traditional kitchen but finds it lacking. \u201cSome apartments without gas have electric stove tops that take forever to heat up and usually don\u2019t distribute the heat evenly.\u201d A quality plug-in griddle is a step up.If you do decide to get to know your griddle better as a multitasking machine, Villarosa suggests getting familiar with how it heats, especially if you\u2019re used to setting a precise temperature for your oven but not your range. \u201cYou can really play around with the dials and figure out which heat settings work best for you. It\u2019s like DJ\u2019ing, almost.\u201dCatch Harold on the 1's and 2's.\nExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
