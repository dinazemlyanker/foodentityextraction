Add spice mixture to garlic-ginger paste and stir well to combine. Transfer marinade to a large resealable bag.Step 3Place chicken breasts in marinade and seal bag tightly. Using your hands, gently massage marinade onto chicken, making sure to evenly coat each breast. Chill 2 hours.Step 4Heat a large skillet over medium-high. Once pan is quite hot, add remaining 1 tsp. oil, swirling pan to coat the entire surface. Reduce heat to medium. Remove chicken from marinade and cook, undisturbed, until lightly golden on one side, 1\u20132 minutes. Flip chicken and continue to cook until golden brown on the other side, 1\u20132 more minutes. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook (without peeking!) 10 minutes. Remove pan from heat and let chicken sit, covered, 10\u201315 minutes, depending on thickness of the breasts. Don\u2019t uncover, or you\u2019ll release the hot steam that cooks the chicken.Step 5Check to make sure the breasts are cooked through\u2014there shouldn't be any pink in the middle, and if you have an instant-read thermometer, the chicken should register 165\u00b0. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and slice into strips. Transfer to a platter. Garnish with cilantro and mint.How would you rate Garlic-Ginger Chicken With Cilantro and Mint?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (41)Back to TopTriangleI love this recipe.  I had to grab a bag of freeze dried mango and crush it for the Anchu.  I used skinless breasts and crushed my spices.  The flavors were perfect and the chicken was flavorful and tender.  I decided to mix it up a little with stir fried veggies with a touch of pad tai sauce and rice noodles   Almost licked the plate..BruceWashington, DC11/21/2021This is a great recipe.  Very easy to make.  I don't ever cook with salt and this recipe's taste is so delicious without it.  I will make this again and again.  I love this.Maggie KingsfordNorthern Ontario, Canada8/14/2021Made this for my family including two 8 year olds.  I had to skip the pepper bc kiddos and could not find amchur powder at my local asian grocer.  That said this is my first attempt at making anything Indian and was feeling intimidated haha.  But easy recipe and well written.  My Indian friend told me not to worry about that amchur that the lemon juice was plenty for acidity as the amchur imparts even more sour taste and this chicken did not need it and I see now that the comments talk a lot about high acidity. So consider leaving out the amchur. It's made from green mangoes not ripe mangoes.  Also my son says it was 'bland' so I will maybe up the salt and consider ways to add some depth to the flavors here. Maybe marinade longer than 2 hours. Will be nice for a summer meal though and I enjoyed it! Sauce is lovely!Natalie M.Silver Spring, Md5/21/2021Absolutely delicious! Added some lemongrass to the marinade too. Definitely acidic, but we paired it with some curried lentils and the flavors mixed wonderfully. A great technique for chicken breast!DarbyMonaco4/18/2021I used boneless skinless thighs as well and it kind of left it with a dry texture but looked moist; hard to describe. I also think I didn\u2019t add enough salt because it had all the flavor elements but was not flavorful somehow? \n\nI\u2019ll try again with breasts next time BobberCalgary3/24/2021This is pretty much the same as Hariyali chicken, no? Except that it's lacking the dried fenugreek (methi) leaves.DonaldNice, France2/20/2021Made as written and served with coconut rice and pineapple salsa -incredible! Thanks Priya. Anonymous1/7/2021I was really hoping this would be as good as described. The marinade has way too much acid in it. I did marinate overnight, so maybe that was it, and I used thighs instead of breasts, so maybe that was it too, but maybe was it acidic. I paired it with a nice South Indian Dahl, but man was the chicken acidic. Eri Lansing, MI1/7/2021Fantastic!  That's ALL That I Need to Say! Yummy!!!        LGT. Lisa Giordano-ThomasPalm Coast, Florida *USA. 11/23/2020I used a different marinade that included lemon, coriander, cumin, ginger, garlic, honey, evoo, s&p. Followed cooking directions as written. The chicken was done to a perfect 160 but had an odd texture - and wasn't dry but not moist either. I will try it with the recipe as written - I like the cooking technique.JoeRockville, MD11/16/2020Hi, can the chicken marinade longer than the two hours?Anonymous10/30/2020Where is the nutritional information?Anonymous10/1/2020Delicious! I made the marinade per the instructions (plus a pulse in the blender because my chopping was a bit too casual) but I used it on skinless thighs, which I then baked. A marinade recipe I will certainly keep!AnonymousNew York9/22/2020I used powdered coriander and found that a tablespoon of it was totally overwhelming- I threw out half the marinade put the rest in a blender with a ripe mango. AnonymousNYC6/22/2020This is an amazing recipe, Priya is right, very juicy and VERY flavorful and I really dislike chicken breasts (I love legs). I am guessing you did not do the recipe right if you think it is not flavorful. \nBut one tip is that it is immensely better with rice or quinoa, it just soaks up some of that flavor and is a perfect balance. If you like Indian food it is addictive.
