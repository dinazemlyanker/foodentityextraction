For the most luscious froth, serve fizzes in tall glasses without ice. Make sure your soda and glasses are well chilled before starting, either by chilling in the fridge an hour or more beforehand or filling with ice water and letting them sit while you make the drink.*Raw egg is not recommended for the elderly, people with weakened immune systems\u2026or people who don\u2019t like raw egg.IngredientsMakes 240rosemary leaves (from 1 sprig)Pinch of kosher salt1large egg white*13\"-long strip lemon zest4\u00bdoz. mezcal2\u00beoz. fresh lemon juice1\u00bdoz. light agave nectar6oz. chilled club soda2sprigs rosemary, briefly singed over flame of a gas burner if desiredPreparationStep 1Chill 2 Collins glasses.

I didn\u2019t have any idea how the rosemary and mezcal would pair, but it was lovely and warm for a winter celebration. Easy to make for 4-6 folks as well. AnonymousAlexandria, VA12/29/2021Delish! The smokiness of the mezcal and the piney Rosemary work really well together. I used El Jolgorio Barril Mezcal and fresh Rosemary from my garden. I substituted an amber agave nectar and think it added a little more color and richness. I really enjoyed this cocktail. \nAhem- For previous reviewers, this ingredients list makes two drinks (2 \u00bc ounces of Mezcal per drink). Cheers! Rob T. Seattle7/2/2021I don't understand the formatting of the ingredients\u2013is it 4.5 oz of mezcal or 4x 0.5 ox of Mezcal (so 2 oz)?ABGlasgow, Scotland5/21/2021How is .5 oz of Mezcal a drink? \n...Asking for a friend. \nAlso, add 2.5 more oz. od boozeShazzizNYC5/19/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titCocktailDrinks AllRosemaryHerbs & SpicesMezcalAlcohol & Other DrinksDrinksRecipes you want to make.
