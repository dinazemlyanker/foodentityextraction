Consider any crispy shards of cheese that get stuck to the pan the chef\u2019s treat. \u2014Diana YenAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

The cheese on the outside is worth it and so good. Make sure to drain the kimchi well before adding it to the sandwich, and I actually cooked the kimchi for a bit on the side of the pan, which melted the cheese in the middle much faster when I added the hot kimchi. LizBrooklyn, NY1/29/2022DELICIOUSKathyLebanon,IN10/25/2021The bread gets pretty soggy and becomes very difficult to flip. Messy in the pan because the cheese is shredded and it\u2019s too much work for what it is. The taste is decent, the mixture of the cheddar and kimchi is weird but not too unpleasant. My roommates liked it but I thought it was just okay. All around pretty mid. JacobFort Collins, CO10/20/2021The level of difficulty associated with trying to cook cheese on the outside of a sandwich seems probably not within the realm of those looking for direction in these pages.AnonymousChicago 10/17/2021At first read through, this recipe seemed like a wildcard on whether it would taste good or not. But I\u2019m pleasantly surprised to report this is truly heavenly. It\u2019s sweet spicy gooey crispy. I\u2019ll be making this on repeat until the kimchi jar is done.
