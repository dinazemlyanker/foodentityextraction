The town is in the state of Sinaloa, where gorditas are thicker corn patties with a ridge around the edges to hold all the toppings. \u201cMy recipe for a gordita that is split open and filled is more common outside of the area,\u201d says Rick, \u201cbut the filling, made with shrimp, reflects the amazing seafood that is abundant in this coastal city.\u201dIngredients4 Servings1\u2153cups instant corn masa flour (such as Maseca)5Tbsp. lard, melted, or vegetable oil, divided2\u00bdtsp. Diamond Crystal or 1\u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt, divided, plus more4guajillo or dried New Mexico chiles, stems and seeds removed2morita chiles, stems removed, or 2 canned chipotle chiles in adobo1tsp. ground coriander or cumin1\u00bdlb. medium shrimp, peeled, deveined4garlic cloves, thinly sliced2sprigs thyme1Tbsp. apple cider vinegar1tsp. agave syrup or honey3Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into piecesSliced onion, sliced avocado, cilantro leaves with tender stems, and lime wedges (for serving)PreparationStep 1Stir masa, 1 Tbsp. lard, 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton salt, and 1 cup water in a medium bowl until a soft and slightly sticky dough forms. If dry, mix in another 1 Tbsp. water. Cover and let sit at least 30 minutes and up to 3 hours.Step 2Meanwhile, bring guajillo chiles, morita chiles, coriander, and 1\u00bd cups water to a boil in a small saucepan. Cover, remove from heat, and let sit, stirring occasionally, 30 minutes to allow chiles to soften. Transfer to a blender and pur\u00e9e until smooth; set aside.Step 3Place rack in lowest position in oven; preheat to 500\u00b0. Brush a rimmed baking sheet with 2 Tbsp. lard. Divide dough into 4 pieces and form into balls. Set on work surface and cover with a damp kitchen towel. Place 1 ball between 2 sheets of parchment or wax paper. Using a small skillet or saucepan, gently press ball into a 5\"-diameter disk. Carefully peel away parchment; place on prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining balls.Step 4Bake gorditas until outer edges are lightly golden, 10\u201312 minutes. Turn over and bake until golden brown and crisp, 10\u201312 minutes. Transfer to plates and let cool 10 minutes. Insert a paring knife into side of gordita and, using a slow sawing motion, cut open along one side (keep other side intact).Step 5Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. lard in a large skillet over high. Cook shrimp until lightly browned and just cooked through, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a medium bowl. Reduce heat to medium and cook garlic in same skillet, tossing often, until beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Add thyme sprigs, vinegar, agave, 1\u00bd tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt, and reserved chile pur\u00e9e. Cook, stirring occasionally, until brick red and the consistency of a thick sauce, 6\u20138 minutes. Add shrimp and any juices and cook 1 minute. Remove from heat; add butter and stir constantly until melted and sauce is glossy. Season with more salt if needed. Remove and discard thyme.Step 6Fill gorditas with shrimp mixture, onion, avocado, and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over.How would you rate Gorditas con Camarones?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (5)Back to TopTriangleI followed this to the letter.  The Gorditas were hard and tasteless even though I brushed the rimmed baking sheet with bacon fat.  We served tostada style as there was no way they were going to cut open and make a pocket to stuff with the shrimp.  They were so hard even too hard to cut through and eat.  I cooked as long as the recipe called for.  Obviously too long. Sauce was average- made a ton much more than needed.  I'd try making them again but definitely a different recipe and method.MofroChicago8/18/2021Give us more Rick!!!! I am on a rick craze but I\u2019m running out of recipes pls send help. This one was really good btwAnonymousSan Francisco10/15/2020This was amazing! I am so looking forward to Rick's book. There isn't anything I would change about this recipe. I also made the gorditas too thin (I was too focused on the 5\" diameter). It was possible to cut them open but the crispiness made them a bit brittle and difficult to stuff. We had the leftovers with eggs for breakfast the next day - so tasty!AnonymousVancouver, Canada10/8/2020I over baked the gorditas and ended up using them more like a thick chip, but it still worked  with the shrimp, which was absolutely delicious!AnonymousSeattle, WA9/13/2020Made this last night for a friend and we both loved it. Instead of pressing the gorditas(my colombian mom calls them arepas) I just formed them in my hands. The puree sauce is to die for, I would highly recommend making that sauce in larger batches for other dishes you want. Make sure to slice those onions thin or they are kind of clunky.StevenJacksonville, FL8/25/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titMexicanLatin AmericanShrimpShellfishSeafoodMasaRice & GrainsMainNut-FreeGluten-FreeHealthyishDinnerRecipes you want to make.
