Just having one is a victory!And yet, some recipes demand light and others dark. The good news is that light and dark brown sugar are interchangeable: You\u2019re not going to ruin your cookies, your crumble, or your banana bread by swapping one for the other.But let\u2019s take a step back: What even is brown sugar? Refined brown sugar (as opposed to raw brown sugars like turbinado or muscovado) is simply white sugar with the addition of molasses. And the amount of molasses is what distinguishes light brown (less molasses) from dark brown (more). Dark brown sugar actually contains nearly twice as much molasses as light (6.5% as compared to 3.5%), which gives it a richer caramel flavor.While light and dark brown sugar are interchangeable, they\u2019re not exact substitutes. Using dark brown sugar when a recipe calls for light will give your final product a more robust taste and a darker color, and it might slightly affect the texture. Because acidic molasses reacts with baking soda, using dark brown sugar in place of light might cause a higher rise and/or a wider spread. This probably isn\u2019t something you\u2019ll notice unless you\u2019re conducting a side by side test of two batches, but it could be a reason that your cookies don\u2019t come out exactly like the ones in the photo.It\u2019s also worth noting that the more brown sugar the recipe calls for\u2014a whole cup as opposed to a couple of tablespoons\u2014the bigger the impact a substitution will make. If you\u2019re whisking together a marinade and you only have light brown sugar, NBD. But if you\u2019re baking a crumb cake that calls for a whopping 1\u00be cups dark brown sugar for the streusel, you\u2019ll probably want to get your hands on the right stuff since so much of the flavor is going to come from the additional molasses.All that being said, if you\u2019re only going to keep one kind on hand, let it be light brown sugar. It\u2019s more common, a bit more versatile due to the subtler flavor, and many pro bakers (like Dorie Greenspan, Joanne Chang, and Sarah Kieffer) use it to develop their recipes.Just add it to the mental list, right after the toilet paper.A muffin!Butternut Squash, Coconut, and Ginger MuffinsLike the best possible Morning Glory muffins but with grated butternut squash instead of carrot.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasically BakingBrown SugarRecipes you want to make.
