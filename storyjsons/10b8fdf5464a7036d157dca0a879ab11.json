It\u2019s often cooked in a traditional clay pot (called a ttukbaegi) but you can cook the eggs in any small heatproof bowl to get the same effect at home. Use the leftover mushroom dashi in place of the water in Kimchi Jjigae or Spicy Soft Tofu and Seafood Stew for extra flavor.Ingredients4 servingsVegan Dashi8dried shiitake mushrooms\u00bdwhite or yellow onion, thinly sliced5garlic cloves44x4\" pieces kombuSteamed Eggs2scallions5large eggsKosher saltCrushed toasted nori sheets (for serving)PreparationVegan DashiStep 1Bring mushrooms, onion, garlic, kombu, and 2 quarts water to a simmer in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, reducing heat as needed to maintain a simmer, 30 minutes.Step 2Strain dashi through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl (or an airtight container if not using right away) and let cool.Step 3Do Ahead: Dashi can be made 1 week ahead. Cover and chill.Steamed EggsStep 4Separate dark green tops from scallions; thinly slice both parts and set aside separately. Gently whisk eggs in a heatproof ceramic bowl that can hold at least 3 cups water (a pair of chopsticks are the ideal whisking tool since they fully incorporate the eggs without introducing too much air). Add \u00be cup cooled dashi and season with salt (you\u2019ll need about \u00bd tsp. kosher salt, as the dashi is unseasoned). Stir in reserved scallion whites and pale green parts.Step 5Place bowl inside a large saucepan with a tight-fitting lid. Pour in water to come two-thirds up the sides of the bowl. Cover saucepan and set over medium-high heat. Bring water to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until eggs are just set (they will still wobble slightly when gently wiggled), 18\u201325 minutes.Step 6Serve eggs topped with crushed nori and reserved scallion greens.How would you rate Dashi-Steamed Egg Custard?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (1)Back to TopTriangleNeeds salt too, if not soy sauce and maybe sesame oil...just no flavor. Chawan mushi needs the bonito for the dashi, or there's got to be some flavor to this veg dashi. Thinly sliced in some of the cooked kombu and shiitake too.AnonymousBuffalo, NY3/4/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titCustardDessertKoreanEast AsianAsianShiitake MushroomMushroomVegetableEggSideStarterDairy-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreeVegetarianKetoSteamDinnerRecipes you want to make.
