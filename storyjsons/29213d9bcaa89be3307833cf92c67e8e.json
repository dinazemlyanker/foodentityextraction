How about a cozy cabin? There\u2019s a drink for that.By Alex DelanyDecember 1, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Yudi ElaFacebookTwitterEmailWelcome to\u00a0The Pour, a monthly column about what we\u2019re drinking right now.A holiday cocktail can go in just about any direction, depending on the occasion, the crowd, or, hell, even just how your day\u2019s been going. Which is why for our Holiday Issue this year, we asked some of our favorite booze professionals to make us, well, whatever they wanted to make us for the holidays. And they delivered. Below, we\u2019ve got a recipe to fit whatever vibe you\u2019re feeling.\u00a0The Fireside MovePhotographs by Yudi Ela, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Sophie StrangioWe use orgeat quite a bit at the restaurants. Traditionally it\u2019s an almond syrup, but we\u2019ve made it with everything from walnuts to pistachios. It gives a beautiful toasted nut flavor to a cocktail. Here I used pecans because they remind me of the family pecan tree at my grandparents\u2019 house in Fayetteville, GA. Roasted pecans. Warm baking spices. Citrusy, caramelly Amaro Montenegro. A bit of spicy rye whiskey. They all work well together to create a cocktail that feels toasty. That\u2019s what I love in a winter drink. \u2014Joseph Stinchcomb, beverage director at Saint Leo, Oxford, MSGet the Recipe \u00bbThe Sparkling Pre-Midnight MovePhotographs by Yudi Ela, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Sophie StrangioEveryone loves something sparkly for the holidays. And by adding absinthe\u2014which is higher proof and packed with warm flavors\u2014even the least fancy glass of bubbly feels special. Whatever bubbly you have on hand works: Champagne, Prosecco, cava\u2026any of these will bring the party and leave whoever you\u2019re toasting feeling wonderful. \u2014Chelsea Gregoire, owner and consultant at Drinkable GeniusGet the Recipe \u00bbThe Non-Alcoholic MovePhotographs by Yudi Ela, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Sophie StrangioI originally created this as a nonalcoholic pairing for a dessert course. The roasted, earthy notes of the h\u014djicha (roasted green tea) carry the warming toasted baking spices for a comforting low-caffeine wintertime brew. Now I make this for my husband and myself at home all the time. I love it with shortbread cookies and coffee cake in the morning or with ice cream at night. My parents are back home in Japan and I sent my mom this recipe for a gathering they had last year. She made a big batch and kept it warm in the Crock-Pot for guests to serve themselves. There\u2019s no situation where this wouldn\u2019t be good. \u2014Julia Momose, creative director, Kumiko, ChicagoGet the Recipe \u00bbThe Not-So-Snowy MovePhotographs by Yudi Ela, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Sophie StrangioI want a holiday cocktail that brings me to the pool. I\u2019m that person (usually joined by all my cousins) who drinks tequila at Christmas. Here I make it even beachier with fresh citrus juice, a little bit of red pepper jelly heat and a generous pour of crisp Mexican-style lager. When it comes to the beer, I\u2019m all about Victoria or Pacifico, but I\u2019ll let you go with whatever brand you like, just as long as it\u2019s light and takes you straight to the cabana. \u2014Tiffanie Barriere, drinks educator at The Drinking CoachGet the Recipe \u00bbWant more holiday cocktail recipes?
