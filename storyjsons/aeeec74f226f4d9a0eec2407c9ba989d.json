While the impending climate crisis isn\u2019t the cheeriest holiday party conversation starter, the fact of the matter is that Americans annually produce over 25 million tons of extra trash from Thanksgiving to New Year\u2019s. We all have a responsibility to look after our planet, so we\u2019re helping you give the green way with this lineup of 13 waste-saving, tree-planting, eco-friendly gift ideas. For extra credit try popping your presents into reusable tote bags rather than swaddling them in gift wrap and swapping out plastic-coated ribbons for biodegradable cotton string. For stocking stuffers, bundle small items into decorative beeswax food wrap, which can be used again and again in the kitchen in place of plastic wrap. Whatever you decide to do, eco-friendly packaging is only as good as the contents inside\u2014so here are our picks for the best sustainable gifts for an Earth-friendly holiday season:Zwilling Fresh & Save Vacuum Sealer SystemSave your leftovers from an untimely end with this handy vacuum-sealing system. This starter set comes with an adorable mini-vacuum pump, reusable zip bags, and dishwasher-safe storage containers designed to slow spoilage and keep food fresh up to five times longer. Staff writer Alex Beggs even swears it keeps her avocado halves from turning brown. It\u2019s a great gift for every kind of cook, from bread bros who can\u2019t bear to toss another stale sourdough to meal-prepping parents who want Thursday\u2019s apple slices to be just as crisp as they were on Monday.ZWILLING J.A. Henckels,LLCZwilling Fresh & Save$80 at Amazon \u2013 6 Piece Set$125 $100 at Zwilling \u2013 7 Piece SetBamboozle Nesting BowlsThis set of seven bowls has all the benefits of plastic\u2014fun colors, durability, no chance of metallic flavoring\u2014without the planet-destroying downsides. They\u2019re made from upcycled bamboo fibers bound together with 15% melamine (a food-safe organic compound), and they\u2019ll degrade in a landfill in 22 years. The baker in your life won\u2019t want to toss them, though; they\u2019re deeper than the average mixing bowl, which makes for both aesthetic appeal and splash-free whisking.Bamboozle Nesting Bowls$80 at Bon App\u00e9tit Market$80 at AmazonXaquixe Tumbler SetThese gorgeous drinking glasses aren\u2019t just green in hue. Each tumbler is hand-blown from 100% recycled materials, and Oaxaca-based glass studio Xaquixe uses renewable energy sources\u2014namely, burnt cooking oil salvaged from local hotels and restaurants\u2014to power up their furnaces, reducing their carbon footprint. Even if you choose to gift them in turquoise, fuchsia, or saffron, these glasses are as green as can be.Xaquixe Bristol Tumblers$50 at Goodee (Set of 2)Vahdam Teas Porcelain TeapotBala Sarda\u2019s family has been in the tea industry for over 80 years, and in addition to producing fresh, potent blends like Early Grey Chai, his company, Vahdam, also makes high-quality tea accessories as pretty as they are functional. Considering that teabags are notoriously non-recyclable, and that nylon ones release microplastics right into your teacup, this pot\u2019s built-in stainless-steel steeping tube will help your loved one with the tea habit make the switch to loose-leaf\u2014which makes better tea in addition to being more sustainable. Vahdam is plastic- and carbon-neutral and invested in the communities where its teas are produced.Gleam Porcelain Teapot$22 at Amazon$35 at VahdamClick & Grow Smart Garden 3Made for aspiring green-thumbs without garden access, this compact countertop planter is fitted with built-in grow lights and a self-watering tank, taking the guesswork out of growing fresh herbs and veggies at home. Watching little leaves of basil and lettuce sprout from their pods makes us feel more connected to the earth, even from our cramped Brooklyn apartments. It\u2019s perfect for keeping single-use plastic clamshells of wilted herbs out of your kitchen and, subsequently, out of our oceans.Photo courtesy of NordstromClick & Grow Smart Garden 3$100 at Nordstrom$100 $75 at Click & GrowVital Choice Vital BoxGive the gift of good eating with this curated box of certified sustainable seafood.

Just make sure the kids don\u2019t mistake it for the cookie jar!Typhoon Compost Caddy$32 at Bed Bath & BeyondRamona Farms White Tepary BeansIf you\u2019re looking for a low-cost stocking stuffer or a unique gift for all your work friends, the answer is beans. Dried beans reign supreme for experienced chefs, and newbies will get the extra gift of learning how to cook them. Tepary beans have been grown for generations by Indigenous Akimel O\u2019odham and Tohono O\u2019odham people in the Sonoran Desert, and for good reason\u2014they\u2019re extremely drought- and heat-tolerant, which means they\u2019re a low-impact crop able to survive climbing temperatures. Supporting Indigenous land stewardship is one of the best (and most sustainable) ways to spend your money, and on a culinary note, we can confirm that these beans are creamy and delicious, great for everything from a summery bean salad to a warming autumnal chili.Ramona Farms White Tepary Bean$9 at Snuk FoodsVejibag Vegetable Storage BagBefore we tested out Vejibags, we thought reusable produce bags were a slightly splurgy kitchen luxury. However, we\u2019ve upgraded them to kitchen necessity. Never again will your chosen recipient dejectedly compost their slimy or dried-out cilantro! And for us, a head of Boston lettuce\u2014which normally wilts in the fridge within days\u2014stayed nice and crisp even after a week and a half inside the Vejibag, which is made from nontoxic organic cotton that is free of dyes. It\u2019s science, but it feels like magic.Vejibag Vegetable Preservation Bag$23 at HiveFuego Box Hot Sauce CrateAn ideal gift for all the hotties in your life, this reusable wooden gift box is packed with chile peppery goodness: three knockout sauces\u2014bright habanero and carrot, earthy ghost pepper and jalape\u00f1o (our favorite), and tangy California reaper and pineapple\u2014plus reaper-infused blossom honey and a ghost pepper and Himalayan pink salt blend. What makes this an eco-friendly gift? Fuego Box has pledged to plant five trees for every crate purchased to cool down the planet while spicing things up.Fuego Box Hot Sauce Gift Crate$60 at Food52Compostable Kitchen Brush SetSociety has advanced past the need for sponges, which harbor so much bacteria that they need to be replaced every other week and can take hundreds of years to decompose. It\u2019s time to ditch those dingy dish sponges and grab this stunning six piece gift set of kitchen brushes from German company Redecker. Beautifully crafted from untreated beechwood with stiff plant fiber bristles, these sturdy compostable brushes are so chic they almost make us want to volunteer for post-dinner dish duty.
