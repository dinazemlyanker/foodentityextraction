But I will! It\u2019s an It\u2019s-It.Okay, I realize that It\u2019s-Its are an unlikely contender. They\u2019re largely unknown outside of California, somewhat grammatically traumatizing to type, and are made from the underdog of the cookie world: oatmeal cookies. I know some of you are already groaning: Of course California has an ice cream sandwich made with oatmeal cookies. But these cookies are doused in chocolate shell! The Chipwich could never. Also, there are no raisins involved, because I\u2019m not a monster. Plus I love a good underdog story.It\u2019s-Its were created in San Francisco back in 1928, and they\u2019ve been a regional favorite ever since. I've loved them my whole life, mainly because I was lucky enough to attend summer camp in Northern California, 80 miles north from the original It\u2019s-It factory. Blessedly, the camp somehow decided to adopt the It\u2019s-It as the Official Camp Ice Cream, and each Saturday the counselors would dole them out. It was a feeding frenzy.As a sugar-crazed child getting a weekly ration of ice cream, you can\u2019t do much better than an It\u2019s-It. Especially at a scorching hot summer camp with basically no AC. It\u2019s-Its are surprisingly dense for their size and explosively flavorful\u2014there is no grace in eating one. The ice cream runs down your arm, the chocolate shell melts onto your fingers, and the chewy oatmeal cookies do their very best to hold the whole thing together. Then suddenly you find yourself horking down the whole thing in a blur of cookie bits. It is glorious.The famed It's-It pins.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigThe It\u2019s-It so defined my camp experience, the camp administration even decided to adopt the treat as the \u201csecret\u201d logo to identify traveling campers. Each summer, the migration to camp is marked by herds of 9-year-olds traipsing through San Francisco Airport with giant yellow It\u2019s-It buttons pinned to their jackets. It\u2019s quite cute, and a bit like going to camp in a Wes Anderson movie.Still, I realize that many people have probably never had an It\u2019s-It before. This must be corrected immediately.  Luckily, you can ship yourself an entire case (25 beauties, all to yourself!), or track them down in Costos, Walmarts, and, yep, artisanal grocery stores. They're currently available in California, Arizona, Washington, Oregon, Texas, Hawaii, Colorado, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York.Should you choose to order these perfect ice cream sandwiches online, there are many flavors available to you. But in my eyes, there are only three acceptable ones: vanilla, chocolate, and mint. Of course there are other options\u2014the factory has expanded their flavors to keep up with the times, adding newcomers like pumpkin and green tea to the rotation. I understand the need to compete with activated charcoal soft serve, but give me mint or give me nothing.Buy: It's-Its, $22 for 24.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIce CreamRead MorecookingGet Lost In the Swirls of This Strawberry-Coconut Ice Cream PieBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
