Plus more bits from the week at BA.By Alex BeggsMay 30, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailAlex LauFacebookTwitterEmailEvery Friday morning, Bon App\u00e9tit senior staff writer Alex Beggs shares weekly highlights from the BA offices, from awesome new recipes to office drama to restaurant recs, with some weird (food!) stuff she saw on the internet thrown in. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.The big enchilada\u201cPretend you\u2019re at a restaurant,\u201d I asked the fam. \u201cWhat would you order?\u201d And a special request came in: Enchiladas. (Phewph, good thing no one wanted Il Timpano.) So last week, we made a tray and a half of Rick Martinez\u2019s chicken enchiladas with charred salsa verde. They were astounding! ALSO you can adapt this recipe to fill it with whatever your heart desires: squash, sweet potato and black bean, leftover carnitas?! etc. It\u2019s flexible like that. When Wednesday rolled around, I had the last enchilada for breakfast with a mug of black coffee. 10/10.Get the recipe: Chicken Enchiladas VerdesWant this letter before it hits the website?

But instead of eating it at the beach, we ate it around the coffee table watching the neighbor across the street trim the grass around the No Parking sign in his lawn WITH SCISSORS.Get the recipe: Big-Ass Beach HoagieYAYY CARLAThis week, our own Carla Lalli Music won a James Beard Award for her excellent cookbook, Where Cooking Begins. I\u2019ve been making her dead-simple recipe for coconut cabbage slaw a lot lately (it makes a ton and stores well), worth buying the entire book for IMO. The best thing about this award is the video Carla\u2019s son took of her when she found out she won, doing the Elaine dance in a flowing caftan.

The dough is your canvas, be free!Unnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekPhoto by Chelsie Craig, food styling by Pearl JonesThe humble meatloaf! So maligned and misunderstood. But not by Chris Morocco, whose Bulgogi Meatloaf Sandwich combines two loves: Korean bulgogi marinade and ye olde meatloaf. But we wondered, would the word \u201cmeatloaf\u201d be a turn off to readers? \u201cI feel like pop culture had a big meatloaf smear campaign in the 2000s,\u201d noted meatloaf historian Jesse Sparks, and when it comes to the sandwich versions, he prefers eating it \u201cmore than I like thinking about it as a concept.\u201d Hilary Cadigan did the Slack equivalent of ducking under her desk by cloaking her opinion in sideways umbrellas: (I love meatloaf.) Carla wrote a movie poster tagline, \u201cMeatloaf: it\u2019s not great.\u201d \u201cBalls are better than loaves,\u201d declared Cristina Martinez, arguing they have more surface area for sauce. That got a quick reply from Molly Baz: \u201cTo all the haters, meatloaf is just large format balls so you can\u2019t say you like one and not the other!!!!\u201d She added: \u201cThe best thing is re-fried meatloaf. Slice it up, fry it \u2018til crispy.\u201d WOW. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite American food, not gonna lie,\u201d said truth-teller Joseph Hernandez. \u201cMy mom would make two on my birthday, so I\u2019d have leftovers for a few days.\u201d Alex Delany waxed poetic for a bit, concluding that \u201cpeople just don\u2019t give meatloaf enough of a chance flavor-wise...That meatloaf Moroccs developed is UNREAL. So much flavor.\u201d Kinda makes you want to try it...no?More importantly, get the recipe: Bulgogi Meatloaf SandwichExplore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead Moreculture32 Highly Achievable, Totallllllllllly Normal Quarantine Cooking ProjectsBy Alex BeggscookingI Gave In and Got the Reusable Paper TowelsBy Alex BeggscookingThis Pink Drink Is My Favorite Way to Consume RhubarbBy Alex BeggscultureAll \u2018Gussed Up and Nowhere To GoBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
