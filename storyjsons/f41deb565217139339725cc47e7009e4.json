So, armed with a magnetic whiteboard and a few Expo markers, I write an inventory on the fridge door.I\u2019ve had a whiteboard on my fridge for years, but most of its real estate was devoted to reminders to water the plants or buy more toilet paper. Then the pandemic hit, and my shopping and cooking went into hyperspeed. You probably know what happened next: I was making fewer trips, filling my grocery cart higher than ever, and creating more leftovers. Even the best-laid dinner plans were forgotten in the chaos of 2020.\u00a0I\u2019ve never been a big meal planner, but I did need a system to ensure that chard wouldn\u2019t disappear into the back of my fridge for weeks. One year later, it\u2019s become an essential part of my low-waste cooking routine.Here\u2019s how it works: As soon as I get home from the store, I write a produce list on the corner of my small magnetic fridge whiteboard. I try to order it by priority level: Delicate items like herbs and tomatoes go at the top so they're right at eye level, sturdier potatoes and cabbage go at the bottom. I\u2019ve even developed an admittedly loose annotation system of asterisks and exclamation points to mark when I have a lot of something to use up.Once I\u2019ve mapped out every potential ingredient in my lineup, I write up a loose meal plan for the week. After all, the best defense is a good offense. I start with any recipes I had in mind when I went to the store, then brainstorm meals to make the most of everything left over. If I have an abundance of tender greens that are here for a good time, not a long time (looking at you, basil and Little Gem lettuce), I literally write them into as many meals as I can.\u00a0This technique is great for fruits and veggies, but I also use it to track leftovers and proteins, noting if they need to be thawed from the freezer or otherwise prepped. Once the list is as extensive as possible, I rewrite the order to prioritize the meals starring ingredients that have to be used first. Then the cooking begins. As the contents of my fridge slowly deplete, I employ the true magic of a whiteboard, wiping mushrooms and cucumbers off the list until I\u2019m back to a blank slate.I know what you\u2019re thinking: Can\u2019t you just open the fridge and see what\u2019s left? Yes, I guess I could. But the glorious approach of spring and summer produce means I won\u2019t be slowing down on buying vegetables anytime soon, and that translates into seriously crowded fridge shelves. Inevitably, I\u2019ll buy too many precious sugar snap peas, and I\u2019m not leaving their fate up to my memory alone.Photo by Isa ZapataMagnetic Fridge Whiteboard$15 at AmazonMore ways to cut back on waste:1 / 14ChevronChevronCilantro ChutneyView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingGet OrganizedRecipes you want to make.
