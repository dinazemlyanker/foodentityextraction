It wasn\u2019t that my dad didn\u2019t like the good stuff, but on a Tuesday night an $8 bottle of supermarket Zinfandel did the trick. And even though he had a wine cellar full of Two Buck Chuck\u2014and by \u201cwine cellar\u201d I mean a hot hall closet cluttered with off-brand liqueurs that were on special at BevMo\u2014he instilled in me a prejudice that lasts to this day: In this house we do not drink boxed wine.So it was with some hesitancy that I tried Brooklyn distillery St. Agrestis\u2019 latest offering\u2014boxed Negroni. Would the ghost of George Fegan haunt my happy hour? Three-quarters of a box later, there\u2019s no sign of his displeasure, and I\u2019m a boxed cocktail convert.St. Agrestis, a pioneer in the small-batch American amaro trend, released its eponymous amaro in 2014. A few years later it launched Inferno Bitter\u2014a red aperitivo akin to Campari but with even more of a bitter bite\u2014along with single-serving Negronis. The pre-batched cocktail combines Inferno Bitter with Greenhook Gin and house-made vermouth and comes in adorable bottles perfect for the park or smuggling into a movie theater.\u00a0For the boxed version, St. Agrestis gave its Negroni the Costco treatment. Each box contains 60 ounces of cocktail packaged in a plastic bag inside a spigoted box about the size of a babka. It\u2019s as good a Negroni as I could make at home\u2014bittersweet and complex with herbaceous notes balanced by warm vanilla and citrus. At 24% ABV, it\u2019s also bracingly boozy, so even though I store the box in my refrigerator, I drink it over ice for a bit of dilution, sometimes even topped off with a splash of soda.Both the best and worst thing about boxed Negroni is how terribly convenient it is. Like a frozen pizza bagel, Negroni in a box is a Negroni you can have anytime. As far as problems go, this is a good one to have\u2014but during a global pandemic, I\u2019m not sure I needed drinking to be more accessible. In normal times, the 20-serving box would be fantastic for a party, relieving the host of bartending duties. But there are no guests to help me work through more than a magnum\u2019s worth of straight booze, and I don\u2019t live in a big co-op where lentils and nutritional yeast and cocktails are bought in bulk.\u00a0When I open my fridge to contemplate dinner or forage for a cheese snack, the purple-and-yellow St. Agrestis box is there and a Negroni is only a squeeze of the spigot away. I\u2019d like to say that I at least go to the trouble of peeling an orange for a garnish, but my Old Man didn\u2019t raise a liar.KARL BISCHOFFSt. Agrestis Boxed Negroni$60 at Astor Wine & SpiritsExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendCocktailNegroniGinproductShoppingRecipes you want to make.
