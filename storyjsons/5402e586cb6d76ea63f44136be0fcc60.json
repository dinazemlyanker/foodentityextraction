It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you\u2019ll get this letter before everyone else.So, where do recipe-babies come from?I have worked at Bon App\u00e9tit for 6 years and 48 weeks, which means that in less than a month, this job will be turning seven. That\u2019s old enough to have outlasted many marriages, the lifespan of New Coke, and every bathing suit I\u2019ve ever owned.The advantage of this milestone is not only that my coworkers remember me before I had any gray hair, when I was regularly pitching stories about food and marijuana (I was super fun back then). Now that I have seniority\u2014it comes with the gray hair, as it turns out\u2014I can point to lots of recipes we\u2019ve published and say, obnoxiously, \u201cThat one was my idea!\u201d Here\u2019s the way it goes around here: when my pitches get approved, and those assignments yield recipes, the finished dishes are my sassy recipe-babies. This is true even when someone else in the Test Kitchen actually develops, finalizes, and writes the recipe, which at Bon App\u00e9tit we refer to, lovingly, as \u201ccreative collaboration.\u201dWant this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!One of my most prized recipe-babies is Chris Morocco\u2019s expert rendition of the California Veggie Sandwich, which we welcomed into our Bon App\u00e9tit family in August 2016. Like Chris Morocco himself, the California Veggie is an icon. If you consider yourself a sandwich connoisseur, but you don\u2019t have immediate visual recall of this handheld masterpiece, then you don\u2019t really know anything about sandwiches and I\u2019m not sure we have that much in common after all. Just saying. This sandwich, with distinct layers of avocado, sliced pickled carrots, lettuce, sprouts, and cucumbers, deserves some recognition. Perhaps because it\u2019s vegetarian, the C.V. operates on a higher plane, propelled by a tight architectural structure, delightful mix of snappy, creamy, and shreddy textures, salty-sour pickled things, and just enough creaminess to keep it from feeling too virtuous. One of those creamy-fatty things is avocado, which Chris smartly deploys as a lightly smashed and seasoned layer so it doesn\u2019t go slipping and sliding out the side when you take a bite.Most of the time we spent raising this sandwich was harmonious, but Chris and I had to collaborate very creatively about whether it would be better with sliced cheddar or Muenster, or, as he brazenly suggested, goat cheese. For me, it had to be Muenster, the \u201870s-era hippie cheese of choice, but I was willing to compromise on cheddar. The goat cheese thing, though\u2014it was like I didn\u2019t recognize my own child. But here\u2019s the thing about having offspring, or developing recipes: One day they become fully realized beings, and you don\u2019t get to pick out their outfits anymore. And you have to be okay with that. The goat cheese layer, as Chris elegantly argued, is the obvious complement to the avocado, two creamy smashed things anchoring their respective slices of bread to the stack of ruffled, sliced, fresh fillings in the middle. The tangy, crumbly goat cheese is the yin to avocado\u2019s creamy, rich and mellow yang. He was right. This is what parenting is all about.When a recipe-baby is ready, we send it into the world. But I, for one, never forget where they got their start. With me!! They all started with me. And, okay fine, with the other amazing people who work here and care just as much about sandwich architecture as I do, even though I\u2019ve worked here for longer.Get the recipe:California Veggie SandwichView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titVegetarianCarla NewsletterSandwichRead MoreWylie Dufresne\u2019s Scrambled Egg SandwichSpiced Sweet Potato Sandwich with FetaRecipes you want to make.
