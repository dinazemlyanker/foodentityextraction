After slurping my weight of the stuff in Taipei for a week, I returned to New York City very aware of the big, gaping, bowl\u2013shaped hole in my heart. I became obsessed with finding the best version in town, and after months of eating my way through a very real boom of new Taiwanese restaurants, I finally found it at Ho Foods. The version chef-owner Richard Ho serves out of his teeny-tiny spot (there are only 10 seats) in New York\u2019s East Village is a thing of absolute beauty: Glossy, soy-braised beef shanks from sustainable butchery Happy Valley Meat Co. An intricately layered broth made of the braising liquid, jellied beef stock, and a little bit of \u201cmother broth\u201d from the previous day\u2019s batch. Flappy, white flour noodles with the right amount of chew. Mustard greens, salt-pressed and fermented for about a month. And if you\u2019re willing to pay a little extra (which, if you know what\u2019s good for you, you will), a chile crisp\u2013esque finger bowl of beef fat seasoned with three types of chiles. Altogether, it\u2019s like sinking into a pair of 100 percent cashmere joggers (they exist!): It\u2019s satisfying and cozy and, at the same time, so next-level luxurious.Go there: Ho FoodsExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsNew YorkRead MorerestaurantsAn Eating Tour of Taipei, TaiwanGallery12 SlidesBy Matt GrossrestaurantsEddie Huang on Taiwanese FoodBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
