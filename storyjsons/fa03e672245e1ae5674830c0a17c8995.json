We like to think of this sweet and salty dish as a sort of vegetarian bulgogi. Marinating and pan-frying eggplant keeps it firm, flavorful, and chewy\u2014almost meaty. The marinade glazes it as it cooks, so it glistens. Prepared this way, the eggplant looks very special, even though the recipe is easy. It\u2019s a versatile dish that makes a great side for rice and many other preparations. The eggplant tastes wonderful right off the stove, but it\u2019s even better after a few hours, when all the flavors have had time to mingle and deepen. Seek out Korean eggplants, if possible, which are sold in Korean markets. They are thinner than ordinary eggplants and the skin is more tender. But regular eggplants work, too.Excerpted from Maangchi\u2019s Big Book of Korean Cooking: From Everyday Meals to Celebration Cuisine \u00a9\ufe0f 2019 by Maangchi.

Added crispy tofu that had also been marinated. Quite an intense dish that needed a few other elements to round out, a bit of acidity would have balanced it out. AnonymousSydney, Australia12/16/2021This was delicious. Even my vegetable hating partner liked it. cherieeCanada9/19/2021I grow Japanese eggplants in Earth boxes.   I have an abundance of eggplants and am always looking for new recipes.  First of all I recommend to only use Korean, Chinese or Japanese eggplants. They are long and thin.  They have a much more delicate flavor.  Secondly soak your eggplant in water but DO NOT SALT.  My daughter-in-law is Japanese.  No one salts eggplant in Japan.  When you soak them in water you will notice that the water turns brown. I have used this method for years.  My dishes never have a bitter taste. Thirdly I love this marinade.  It is has that lovely hot and sweet taste.  Take the time to find gochugaru.  It makes the dish.M. LaurenOrland Park, IL9/11/2021Made this last night using 3 different types of eggplants I grew in my garden.  I made a few revisions to the recipe: I used less salt, 2 teaspoons total, and let the eggplant sit for 30 minutes.  I then rinsed it quickly in water and squeezed it out small handfuls at a time.  Tot he marinade I added more soy sauce and sesame oil, reduced sugar to 1 TBSP, and added some crushed red pepper flakes as I did not have gochugaru.  It came out delicious! I served it with \"OUR FAVORITE KOREAN CHICKEN RECIPE\" from sliceofjess.com and plain jasmine rice, with cilantro, slices of lime for moisture and citrus kick.  My husband loved it as well!  Will use these recipes again asap.  PS:  Leftovers next day are even better as the flavors have time to meld together over night :)EVNY9/11/2021Made for dinner, doubled the sauce and added tofu. Cooked for way longer to make sure the eggplant was soft and tofu was crispy. Fantastic!! GBHSag Harbor 4/25/2021damn white ppl really calling recipes flavorless and fishy when these are key korean ingredients. get over yourself lol. i made as is & it's perfect.Anonymous4/4/2021Flavorless. Not worth the prep or clean up scrubbing the pan. AnonymousSan Francisco 3/9/2021Fishy. Followed all the steps as written and the eggplant tasted like anchovies. If you like that, then this is a good anchovy substitute for pizza, pasta, etc. It has no place in bibimbap.Susan3/1/2021Flavor was wonderful but much too salty. I will make it again omitting salt from marinade and rinsing before squeezing the eggplant. Patty D12/27/2020I halved all the salt amounts since I was using Morton (as opposed to Diamond) and thought it was appropriately seasoned. Followed all the steps of salting, squeezing, marinating, and chilling and it does lead to a fairly firm texture after cooking. I wouldn't describe it as chewy or meaty. Like some other reviewers, I found the flavour to be a bit flat, and I ended up using some hot sauce and honey to punch it up.AnonymousNew York10/10/2020I think you can actually get away with using quite a bit less salt on the eggplant - I basically sprinkled them lightly with salt and it did the trick without ending up too salty. Also, if you have one, a potato ricer is a big help for squeezing the water out of the eggplant. I also substituted gochujang for gochugaru and used a lot of it. Definitely taste the marinade and make sure it's got the right kick of flavors. Last, after chilling the eggplant in the fridge I noticed it also released a lot more water into the bowl, but I'm glad I added it all back to the pan because I think the flavor would have suffered if I didn't. Hope this helps!Indianapolis, IN9/16/2020I had high hopes for this because the other reviewers liked it. Honestly I couldn\u2019t find much to like about it. The flavor was just kind of one-note sweet and salty. The eggplant was gooey to me, despite all the salting and squeezing we did. For all the prep work it didn\u2019t have many redeeming qualities... we ate most of it though. Also I substituted gochujang for gochugaru and that might have been my fatal flaw... apologies if the fault is my own, but honestly can\u2019t imagine this dish tasting much better than the mediocrity that it was. AnonymousMinneapolis, MN9/1/2020I really loved this! I found it just slightly too salty for my taste, so in the future I\u2019ll probably omit the 1/2 tsp salt from the marinade. Otherwise I think this is a great recipe that I\u2019ll definitely make again. AnonymousToronto5/12/2020This was the most incredible, flavorful vegetarian recipe. The eggplant had no bitterness at all. I constantly crave this now and love eating this with some koshihikari rice or making this into a bibimbap bowl.joolie.gCleveland, OH3/31/2020So spicy and good!  Substituted agave syrup for rice syrup.  \nI will try adding some ginger next timeAnonymoussebastopol, calif3/29/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titKoreanEast AsianAsianEggplantVegetableEasySideVegetarianVeganDairy-FreeDinnerRecipes you want to make.
