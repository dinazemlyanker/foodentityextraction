RossApril 2, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Katie BennFacebookTwitterEmailIn Unfiltered, Bon Appetit's wine editor Marissa Ross shares her latest favorite bottles and\u2014you guessed it\u2014unfiltered thoughts on natural wine.The sun had long since set behind the San Jacinto Mountains that hug the city of Palm Springs by the time I popped the bottle of Avis de Temp\u00eate\u2019s \u201cBlanc No.1\u201d at one of the outdoor fireplaces that freckle the Ace Hotel. Me and Reynaldo Romero, co-owner of Las Palmas Brewing, were shooting the shit: talking wine, beer, J. Cole, SXSW, and wondering if Coachella would be cancelled too. That feels like two months ago, but it was barely two weeks. That was the last wine I shared with another human outside of my home.But that\u2019s not why I chose to write about the Avis de Temp\u00eate\u2019s \u201cBlanc No.1\u201d this month. I chose it because it\u2019s a stunning example of Rousanne. The white grape best known for its work in France\u2019s Northern Rh\u00f4ne shines particularly bright in this bottling. With mineral-driven grapes grown in France\u2019s Savoie region and produced in the oxidative-white-wine-worshipping Jura, winemaker Rapha\u00ebl Monnier has made a perfectly balanced white wine. The nose tries to be coy but can\u2019t help but hide what you are about to sip. It tastes well-rounded with barely baked green apples drizzled with that fancy New Zealand honey your friend brought back for you, and slices of salted pear with high-acid plumes of gardenia and chamomile.I\u2019m now drinking my sixth bottle of Avis de Temp\u00eate\u2019s \u201cBlanc No.1,\u201d at home with my husband while a chicken roasts in the oven. And while this could be a moment to write some rom-com self-isolation bullshit, it\u2019s not. Instead I\u2019m thinking about the three times I bought this wine from Sam Zimman at Psychic Wines, and how every time we bickered because I said I\u2019d never had it before, when truthfully I had loved it so much that I drank it immediately and forgot. And walking into Domaine LA a month ago, seeing a couple bottles left, and excitedly grabbing them.This wine isn\u2019t just a wonderful wine. It\u2019s a wine that\u2019s connected me to shops and people I care about and want to support. I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t say I\u2019m scared of what\u2019s happening with Covid-19. So allow me to be sappy for a moment: I\u2019m grateful for the small interactions and long conversations that my bottles of Avis de Temp\u00eate\u2019s \u201cBlanc No.1\u201d have brought me. I don\u2019t know what the future will bring, but I know that we have to hold on to the things that connect us.Buy it: Avis de Temp\u00eate's Blanc No.1, $32All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
