This time around: how to wash the dishes.Every one of my dinner parties ends like this: My friends look around, assessing the wreckage\u2014the utensils, the ever-multiplying glasses, the plates and bowls and platters\u2014and insist on helping me clean. (They are good friends.) We have a friendly back-and-forth for about five minutes, at which point I hiss \u201cBut I have a system,\u201d which sends them scurrying out the door. (I am also a good friend, but a very particular one.)Illustration by Tim Lahan\u00a0Much of my \u201csystem\u201d\u2014which works in our small apartment, and whether I\u2019ve cooked for eight or, much more often, just for two\u2014is inspired by Peter Miller\u2019s charming and excellent new book How to Wash the Dishes. It saves time, soap, and water and makes me feel like a grand strategist. The dirty dishes are the puzzle\u2014and I\u2019m going to solve it.But wait, before you even sit down to eat: Being an efficient dishwasher is not only about what happens after the meal\u2014much of it hinges on your actions before guests even arrive. You\u2019ve got to set yourself up for success. To do that, I apply a bit of strategy to reduce the number of dishes that will need to be washed in the first place. The fewer dishes I make, the less time I\u2019ll spend scrubbing them.I\u2019m also a big \u201cclean as you go\u201d proponent. In the ideal scenario, anything I\u2019ve used to cook\u2014cutting boards, knives, pots and pans, random graters, measuring devices\u2014will be cleaned and put away before the meal is served. That way, I can start with a clear sink and dish rack.As soon as my friends scram, I turn on my favorite playlist (I can\u2019t reveal my own on the internet, sorry) and get to washing. I\u2019m talking here about washing dishes by hand, but if you\u2019re using a dishwasher, this same strategy will apply to any items that don\u2019t belong in the machine, too. Here it goes:1. Do not clear the dishes into the sink.The sink is your workspace. Clogging it up only slows you down and invites shattered glasses and cracked plates.2. Take a moment to come up with an action plan.If you\u2019ve got room to organize the dishes on your kitchen counter, good for you! Keep like with like and wash from lightest to heaviest, saving anything greasy or gloppy (which can soak in the meantime) for last. Since I\u2019m operating in a small space, I enforce kitchen crowd control: I leave the dishes where they are, whether that\u2019s on the table or on the stove, and bring them to the sink only when it\u2019s their time to shine.Illustration by Tim Lahan4. Make a soap bowl.You know how when you hand-wash a ton of dishes, you end up squirting soap into the sponge a million times? Not anymore. A soap bowl, a reservoir of warm sudsy water, will get you through a dinner\u2019s worth of dishes faster, without wasting soap and a few gallons of water along the way. To do it, place a shallow bowl in your empty sink. It shouldn\u2019t take up the whole basin\u2014you need some room to work. Add a couple of pumps of soap, then trickle in hot water from the faucet.Illustration by Tim Lahan5. Fill it sloooowly.As the water from the faucet drips into your bowl, dip in your sponge and use it to wash the small, not-so-dirty things like glasses and utensils. Don\u2019t submerge anything in the bowl\u2014it\u2019s your clean soap source.Illustration by Tim Lahan6. Once the bowl is full, move on to the bulkier items.When your bowl is good and foamy, tackle the dinnerware (of course, scrape off any remaining food first and rinse if it\u2019s super, um, gunky), followed by heavier items like pots and pans. Saturate your sponge in the soap bowl and pour some of its powerful liquid directly into any dirtier items as needed.Illustration by Tim Lahan7. Rinse off.As you wash, you can either stack up the clean-but-sudsy dishes, then rinse them all later on, or you can rid each one of soap as you go. Either way, you want to direct any dirty runoff into the empty section of the sink and away from your sacred bowl. If your supply does become contaminated (grease happens!), restart with fresh soap and water.8. Pause to dry.As your dish rack fills up, take a breather to dry and put away the dishes. (If you need a towel recommendations, we\u2019ve got it.) Otherwise, you\u2019re building the sort of pile-up you\u2019ll never want to untangle later.And that\u2019s it: The dishes will be finished before you know it\u2014and maybe even before your playlist has ended. Kick your feet up and finish that bottle of wine, but maybe straight from the bottle so that there isn\u2019t another glass to clean.Oh, you have a dishwasher?Yes, There is a Correct Way to Load a DishwasherSince you're probably doing more dishes than ever.View StoryRecipes you want to make.
