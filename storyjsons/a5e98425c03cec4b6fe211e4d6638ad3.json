And I agree. More often than not, the most elegant and enjoyable thing is the simplest. It\u2019s just exactly what you need. Nothing more. Nothing less. And that\u2019s why Leonardo da Vinci sat around and ate Lotus Biscoff Cookies\u2014simple, perfect, understated, sophisticated cookies\u2014all day long. Sleeve after sleeve. With his coffee and without. He\u2019d just lie around his studio munching on Biscoffs until he was inspired to paint or sculpt or draw diagrams of naked people lifting up their arms.Okay, he didn\u2019t do any of that. In fact, he wasn\u2019t even the one that originally said that quote. (Fun fact: The first time it was attributed to da Vinci was allegedly in a Campari ad in 2000.) So, I don\u2019t actually know what kind of cookies ol\u2019 Leo was eating while doing all that Renaissance stuff. And though I\u2019m not quite as accomplished in the fields of art and philosophy as he was, they\u2019re my favorite cookie on the planet. And I think Leo would have agreed\u2014especially when trying them with coffee.Lotus Biscoff Cookies are all about texture and restraint. By themselves, Biscoff cookies are beautifully crispy with just enough of a backbone to give off a satisfying snap when you bite into them, before crumbling in your mouth. But when you dip them into an espresso, cortado, or drip, they soften just a tad, so the cookie is crispy-gone-soggy, a perfect texture to accompany your dose of caffeine.The flavor is warm\u2014filled with notes of nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, and deeply browned caramel. It doesn\u2019t need any flashing lights or sugar-loaded gimmicks. And that\u2019s just fine, because a simple Biscoff Lotus Cookie does its job perfectly. With a coffee, and without.Buy it: Lotus Biscoff Cookies, 2 boxes for $5 at AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
