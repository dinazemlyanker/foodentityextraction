Then use your bottle to make the quintessential summer drink.By Al CullitonMay 23, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Laura MurrayFacebookTwitterEmailTired of cocktail recipes that call for expensive, obscure bottles and fancy-pants techniques? We got you. Welcome to Happy Hour with Al, a monthly column where Al Culliton, Basically\u2019s resident bartender, sets you up to get the most bang for your booze with the fewest possible bottles.I\u2019m quite sure that every spring and summer, gin and tonic consumption increases in direct proportion to the rise in temperature. But before we get to the Tom Collins\u2014a classic gin drink that\u2019s also one of the greatest of all time and perfect for this balmy weather\u2014let\u2019s talk a little about where gin comes from, the members of its family, and how you might explore the world of juniper outside of the bottles you already know.While the English have made a strong claim to gin over the past 300 years, and there certainly is a deep relationship between the spirit and the little island that was once an empire, we actually have the Dutch to thank. The first juniper spirit was born in Holland and it\u2019s not called gin\u2014 it\u2019s called genever. If I made a genever mood board, it would include Frans Hals paintings, a map of the battles of the Thirty Years War, antique earthenware bottles, and windmills.Before we get to old great-great-great-grandaddy genever, let\u2019s talk about juniper, the tie that binds this whole family together. Juniper is a conifer, just like a pine tree, spruce, redwood, or fir. It produces small \u201cberries\u201d that are very flavorful (i.e. piney) and have been used for millennia for medicinal purposes. And that\u2019s just how genever got started.Meet the juniper spirit family: London dry, Old Tom, genever, and a new-age bottle.\nPhoto by Laura MurrayThe history of genever goes way back to the 1500s, when people in the Netherlands (and that included modern-day Belgium, too) started making a medicinal juniper spirit with grain as the base instead of grapes. There are two incredibly cool things about genever.First, it has a completely unique flavor. The old-school styles (these bottles are labeled \u201coude\u201d or \u201ckorenwijn\u201d) have significant amounts of malt spirit\u2014it's basically an unaged whisk(e)y. This results in pleasant cereal notes that act as a backdrop for juniper and any other botanicals the distiller chooses to include, which can vary wildly (orange leaf, celery seed, cinnamon, coriander, angelica, hundreds more). I recommend Rutte\u2019s Old Simon or Bols Genever, both excellent brands.The second thing that makes genever so fascinating is that it was one of the foundational spirits in the early days of the American cocktail, and far more popular than English gin right on through the nineteenth century.Hi there, Old Tom.\nPhoto by Laura MurrayWhich brings us to the next member of the family, the one most directly descended from genever. Old Tom gin is the original English gin. It\u2019s more juniper-forward than many genevers, and, compared to its cousins, it\u2019s relatively sweet. (Hayman\u2019s and Ransom are two good brands that show different facets of the style.)But how did it land on English shores in the first place? Well, a trade war, of course! When the Dutchman William of Orange and his Stuart wife, Mary, ascended to the English throne in 1688 (known as the Glorious Revolution), they immediately began taking steps to promote domestic products over those imported from Catholic France.So, out went Cognac and in came a new style of genever, for the English, by the English, and with a shorter name: \u201cgin.\u201d Unfortunately, William\u2019s pro-gin laws were so effective that gin became cheaper than beer. This made it accessible to the poor and working classes, who had not been used to drinking distilled spirits, and just went ahead and drank pints of it, as they would have beer\u2014a social crisis ensued. And the name? Well, it\u2019s \u201cOld Tom\u201d for the black tomcat painted on signs above clandestine gin mills of the time. (These sprung up after the government tried to reel in the gin crisis by heavily taxing it, which drove operations underground.) Eventually, the price of beer went down and things settled, but gin has been integral to English society ever since.But all of this tumult set the stage for the child that would be crowned king of the juniper spirits: London dry gin. This is the one that\u2019s taken the world by storm over the past two centuries, the one with the big names: Beefeater! Tanqueray! Gordon\u2019s! This is the stuff that propelled the dry martini to stardom.Now if only someone would explain why it's called Beefeater\u2026\nPhoto by Laura MurrayBut what\u2019s the difference between London Dry, king of gins, and the older styles we just learned about? Well, it really is incredibly dry. And it\u2019s very \u201cclean\u201d like vodka, but with way more flavor. The reason: the column still.An invention of the early nineteenth century, the column still differs greatly from its predecessor, which is called a pot still. Pot stills are like great big copper kettles and they are known for producing spirits with more dimension and soul. Column stills, on the other hand, are very tall towers that create pure, unadulterated spirits, basically through a series of little stills along the way to the top. London Dry gin must be made with a column still, and are virtually unsweetened, if sweetened at all, per the category\u2019s regulations. There isn\u2019t a more fitting gin in a G&T, a Gimlet, a Martini, etc. Sometimes, though, when something is that good, people try to improve upon it, or riff on it. Enter the great-great-grand-baby of the family: the new gin.G&T FTW.\nPhoto by Danny KimHave you noticed that gin is in? And it\u2019s not just classic London Dry gins, either. Some of the gins that have gained a lot of traction in recent years are quite different from the old standard bearers. A lot of these modern gins downplay the juniper bit and focus on citrus or other botanicals as the dominant flavor. (Brands like Hendrick\u2019s and Aviation ushered in this new style; look for Neversink, Barr Hill, or AMASS for new and interesting examples of the genre.)  These products have been so popular that bartenders have designed cocktails around a specific gin\u2019s flavor profile. But that\u2019s quite the opposite of what I have in mind today.I propose we make a cocktail that works for any member of the gin family. It\u2019s the most honest, straightforward cocktail you can make, and there\u2019s something ancient and elemental about it. Chalk that up to it being a direct descendent of punch. This, my friends, is the Tom Collins.Lauded for, lo, these two centuries, this fizzy beaut is exactly what we need on a hot summer\u2019s evening. Or afternoon.  A mix of genever, lemon, sugar, and soda, it was born in London at Limmer\u2019s Hotel as the John Collins (named after the hotel\u2019s head waiter!). It was such an instant hit that its brother Tom, made with Old Tom gin, soon followed. When those styles of gin went out of fashion, London Dry took its place and the recipe has been that way ever since.Here\u2019s how to make one, with whatever gin you\u2019ve got:Combine 1\u00bd oz. gin or genever, \u00be oz. lemon juice, and \u00be oz. simple syrup in a cocktail shaker. Add ice and shake hard for 15 seconds. Strain into a Collins glass (yes, the glass is named for the drink) and add fresh ice. Top with soda. Garnish with an orange half-wheel, wrapped around a Luxardo cherry, with a cocktail pick through the whole thing. Enjoy the fruits of your labor and contemplate the centuries of juniper-driven history that brought you to this wonderful moment in time.Al Culliton is a writer, bartender and consultant living in western Massachusetts.
