But local winemaking regions have truly found their footing in modern times, thanks to quick-thinking vintners who\u2019ve taken advantage of the U.K.\u2019s recent warm summers. These days, an increasing number of leading producers are popping up in British counties like Hampshire, Sussex, and Kent, where the limestone-rich soils are perfect for making sparkling wine.While sparkling wines are a must-have for special occasions, British sparklers are particularly unique in their striking versatility, capable of adding subtle complexity to pair with a weeknight dinner. So, looking for inspiration? Here\u2019s how to get the most out of Great Britain\u2019s most enticing sparklers.Balfour Brut Ros\u00e9 2015\nPhoto credit: Paul Winch-FurnessAn Elevated Breakfast AffairTo those who contend wine isn\u2019t suited for the breakfast table, we politely disagree. Light and crisp ros\u00e9s like Hush Heath Estate\u2019s Balfour Brut Ros\u00e9 2015 can help transform ho-hum breakfast gatherings into elevated affairs. Pale salmon-pink in color, this bottling marries Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Pinot Meunier grapes to produce clean notes of wild strawberry, lime, and redcurrant.It\u2019s an excellent match for still-warm-from-the-pan crepes, topped with luxe clotted cream and fresh strawberries tossed with a tangy splash of balsamic vinegar.Brunch Done RightStep aside, Bloody Mary cocktails: Sparkling wines are taking over brunch tables on both sides of the Atlantic. If traditional gut-busting brunch fare is on the menu, turn to the Bolney Estate's stylish-but-traditional Blanc de Blancs, which boasts striking yellow fruit character with floral notes and wonderful yeast-forward undertones. It easily stands up to a hearty platter of Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Sweet Potato Waffles with its smooth texture and fine mousse.If a gastronomically lighter route is your preference, Citrus-And-Dill Gravlax on Rye pairs wonderfully with sips of Ridgeview Wine Estate's Bloomsbury bottling, which packs notes of citrus, peach, and honey. (If you go the latter route, you\u2019ll be in good company: Bloomsbury was the official wine served at Queen Elizabeth\u2019s grand Diamond Jubilee affair in 2012.)Of course, you could always swirl some sparkling wine into a citrusy mimosa or nectar-rich Bellini. For this, opt for a straightforward and well-balanced sparkler such as Bolney Estate\u2019s Bolney Bubbly Brut, which offers floral and brioche notes with hints of zesty citrus fruit, honeysuckle, and elderflower.Ridgeview Wine Estate's Bloomsbury\nJulia ClaxtonA Luxurious LunchCasual lunch fare\u2014a.k.a. the humble sandwich\u2014gets a major upgrade when paired with bubbles. The trick works with nearly anything: Dainty tea sandwiches brimming with slow-roasted turkey, juicy vine-ripened tomatoes, and crunchy strips of bacon? Between bites, sip on Ridgeview Wine Estate\u2019s Fitzrovia Rose, which won silver at Decanter World Wine Awards in 2018 with notes of raspberry, citrus, and honey. In the mood for the perfect burger? Yeah, us too\u2013\u2013always. Enjoy it with Hush Heath Estate\u2019s fruit-forward Balfour 1503 Classic Cuv\u00e9e, a crisp blend of Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, and Pinot Meunier with notes of lemon balm, white flower, green apple, and a hint of red berry fruit. Even crisp crab cakes benefit from a chilled flute of Ridgeview Wine Estate\u2019s Bloomsbury Brut NV, a refreshing and juicy number that smacks of crisp Granny Smith and mellow Golden Delicious apples.Ridgeview Blanc de Noirs\nJulia ClaxtonA Dinner to RememberWhy reserve bubbly for a once-a-year celebration? Break out a sparkling bottle of Ridgeview\u2019s stylish Blanc de Noirs, with its cherry, sweet spice, and fresh herbs, to go alongside a filet of pan-roasted mackerel. Alternatively, a hearty plate of rich duck confit pairs perfectly with a glass of Ridgeview's Cavendish, made with a classic blend of Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier, and Chardonnay that translates to a long-lasting finish and surprising freshness.Balfour 1503 Ros\u00e9\nDon\u2019t forget dessertNever let a chance to pour something sparkling pass you by. At dessert time, sweet treats enriched with red berries\u2014think peach-plum galette with a hefty scoop of vanilla ice cream, or an elaborate pound cake with fig chutney\u2014are perfectly complemented by Balfour 1503 Ros\u00e9 , which brings notes of wild strawberry and herbs to the table.Hungry yet? Whatever\u2019s on the menu, enjoy it with a chilled glass of English sparkling wine \u2014 it pairs with everything, any time.To learn more about the very best of UK food and drink, follow @GreatBritishFood on Instagram.Recipes you want to make.
