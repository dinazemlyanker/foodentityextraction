Never Look Back.Zak the Baker makes the case for adding an unexpected ingredient to the Hanukkah faveBy Zak the Baker, as told to Sarah JampelDecember 1, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhotograph by Emma Fishman, prop styling by Elizabeth JaimeFacebookTwitterEmailAs a secular Jew growing up in the Miami suburbs, Hanukkah was it\u2014the number one holiday of the year, the best part about being Jewish, the pinnacle of the religion. My mom was always the latke cooker, and she took her role very seriously. While I thought everyone liked the latkes my mom made, now that I\u2019m getting older, I\u2019m starting to see a division within the family. Not everyone loves the thin crispy ones. Could there ever be a latke we all look forward to?Zak the Baker, a.k.a. Zak Stern\nThat\u2019s why I was so into these latkes that our night baker Zach Polani shared with me. In Israel, where Zach is from, Hanukkah is everywhere: You smell it at the markets, you hear it in the music, you see it in the offerings at bakeries. Zach\u2019s latkes help re-create that same festive atmosphere here in the diaspora.Soft and fluffy inside (but still crisp on the outside) and more leek than potato, they\u2019re certainly a departure from the latkes I grew up with\u2014and the recipe doesn\u2019t go back generations and generations. Still, potato and leek is a combination I find homey and satisfying. Because these latkes are vegan, eschewing the egg that\u2019s sometimes added, they\u2019re a little bit more inclusive, which is one of our goals as a community bakery. In our kitchen we deep-fry these for all-over browning, but pan-frying is fine too. Sure, any kind of frying can be a bit messy, but the stink of oil and the plumes of onion and potato\u2014that\u2019s Hanukkah for me.Get the Recipe:Vegan Leek LatkesWith crisp outsides, creamy insides, and a subtle sweetness from tons of blanched leeks, these latkes might not be what you\u2019re used to\u2014and that\u2019s a good thing.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHanukkahHoliday 2020Recipes you want to make.
