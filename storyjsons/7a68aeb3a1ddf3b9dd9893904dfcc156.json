You can double the amounts here to make twice as much, but keep in mind that it will take slightly longer for curds to set up and for mixture to reach 115\u00b0.  A note on the milk: don\u2019t use milk labeled \u201cultra-pasteurized,\u201d because it will keep the milk from setting.IngredientsMakes about 1 pint\u00bdgallon whole milk, not ultra-pasteurized and ideally locally sourced\u215btsp. liquid animal rennet2\u00betsp. kosher salt, divided, plus more\u2154cup buttermilk3Tbsp. heavy creamIngredient InfoRennet is an enzyme found in animals\u2019 stomachs used to coagulate milk.Special EquipmentCheeseclothPreparationStep 1Gently heat milk in a large saucepan over low, stirring occasionally, until an instant-read thermometer registers 80\u00b0. Remove from heat, add rennet, and stir to combine. Cover pot with a tight-fitting lid. Let rest in a warm place (so milk will maintain room temperature) until curd is set, looks like the texture of silken tofu, and is just beginning to pull away from sides of pot, 4\u20135 hours.Step 2Using a sharp knife and inserting into pot, cut curd vertically into 1\" strips, then cut 1\" strips horizontally to create a grid pattern. Let sit 5 minutes.Step 3Line a colander with 2 layers of cheesecloth.Step 4Return pot to very low heat (as low as possible) and add 2 tsp. salt. Gently stir with a wooden spoon to break up curds. Continue to cook, stirring once every 5 minutes, until instant-read thermometer inserted into center of curds registers 115\u00b0, about 15 minutes.Step 5Pour curds into prepared colander set over sink and let drain until curds are room temperature, about 15 minutes. Transfer drained curds to a medium bowl. Add buttermilk, cream, and \u00be tsp. salt. Stir with a fork to break up curds and combine. Taste and add more salt if needed. Cover and chill at least 1 hour before serving.Photo by Alex LauStep 6Do Ahead: Cottage cheese can be made 4 days ahead.

Other recipes make the process sound so involved that it scares people off from trying to make cottage cheese. I've made one batch already and and I am typing this review while the second try is setting. (-Dont worry, I will not be typing for 4-5 hours.) \ud83d\ude00Janet P.Edmonton, AB8/14/2021I LOVE cottage cheese...even as a small child. The dairy we used in Houston ( Westmoreland ) had an all Guernsey herd and made the most phenomenal cottage cheese. This recipe is close withe whole buttermilk. Thank you.Diane WCollege Station Tx2/10/2021Can I use vegetable rennet with this recipe?Ann FortAtlanta, GA4/27/2019I have a question regarding the addition of buttermilk in this recipe. Is it necessary? I'm not a fan and would like to avoid the sour tang if at all possible. Anonymous4/24/2019Are the degrees in Fahrenheit? It's kind of confusing 'cause 80\u00b0 Fahrenheit seems kind of low to set curds.AnonymousTurkey9/10/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titAmericanButtermilkOther IngredientsSideSnackNut-FreeRecipes you want to make.
