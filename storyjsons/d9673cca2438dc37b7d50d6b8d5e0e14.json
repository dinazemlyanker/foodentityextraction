That means, of course, that I know the difference between a good bagel and a great bagel when I see one, and that when I say there\u2019s one bagel that\u2019s ruined me for all others, you better believe it\u2019s GREAT. I\u2019d even venture to say that the luxurious three-story tower of bagel heaven served at Arthurs Nosh Bar in Montreal is, in fact, the bagel situation of my dreams.Let me break it down for you: On the bottom floor, you\u2019ll find perfectly toasted sesame bagels, Montreal-style obviously, in all their chewy, slightly sweet glory. Right above the bagels are thick, juicy slices of tomato (when in season) or rye bread (carbs on carbs!) and a tennis-ball-size dollop of tangy cream cheese. Finally, crowning the top of the tower, you get the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me: house-cured gravlax (or smoked salmon, but go for the gravlax because of all of the salty, fatty reasons) along with paper-thin wisps of white onion, lemon wedges, salty capers, and grassy dill. Pile it altogether, and you\u2019ll understand why I can\u2019t look at other bagels in quite the same way.Go there: Arthurs Nosh BarExplore Bon App\u00e9titMontrealBrunchHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make.
