That\u2019s not an exaggeration. The baristas at Abra\u00e7o pulls the richest, most perfectly balanced shots of espresso, using beans roasted in house.ORDER THE: espresso. Or a perfectly executed espresso-based drink. This is an espresso bar, after all. But the true professional\u2019s move is grabbing something from the pastry case. A slice of whatever frittata is on the menu for the day, olive oil cake (perfect for dunking into your cortado), or the truly excellent, sweet-savory cured olive cookie will do the trick.WORD TO THE WISE: You should not ask for almond milk. Or oat milk. Or hemp or soy or cashew. Because Abra\u00e7o doesn\u2019t have any of that stuff. Abra\u00e7o only steams whole milk, which is kind of why we liked the place to begin with: They do what they think is best.THE VIBE IS: warm. Not temperature-wise but in the way the room makes you feel. (Abra\u00e7o means \u201chug\u201d in Portuguese.) An excellent selection of jazz, soul, and classic rock vinyl spins on the record player. Conversation hums from East Village regulars, young and old, sitting or standing at two-tops and the large communal table. The baristas seem like they actually want to serve you coffee (something to note in New York City). The light from the red scripted neon Abra\u00e7o sign washes every inch of the place in a pleasant glow.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Tuesday to Sunday, from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Closed on Monday. It\u2019s also cash only, but there\u2019s a bodega on the corner of 1st Avenue and 7th Street, if you forget.\u2014Alex DelanyAlex LauAlex LauAlex LauWE ALSO LOVEVoyager EspressoThe futuristic Aussie cafe hidden in a Lower Manhattan subway stationHanoi HouseWhere NYC's Vietnamese expats go for a taste of homeBuvetteTr\u00e8s West Village, with hints of ParisExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
