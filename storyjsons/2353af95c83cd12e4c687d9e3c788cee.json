Or at least from these chicken meatballs.By Alex BeggsJanuary 11, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Susie Theodorou, Prop Styling by Sophie StrangioFacebookTwitterEmailEvery Friday morning, Bon App\u00e9tit senior staff writer Alex Beggs shares weekly highlights from the BA offices, from awesome new recipes to office drama to restaurant recs, with some weird (food!) stuff she saw on the internet thrown in. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Cook the way you want to FEELThat was the magazine headline for the new Healthyish Feel Good Food Plan. So if you want to feel like a roly-poly meatball\u2014who doesn\u2019t?\u2014I have just the recipe for you. Chris Morocco\u2019s chicken-and-rice meatballs with hummus (store-bought). I made them this week and they\u2019re as delicious as they are easy. And flexible! Season with whatever random spice mix you got for Christmas, which in my case was this Penzey\u2019s gingery curry powder.

I was at my favorite museum in the world, the M\u00fctter Museum in Philadelphia. There\u2019s a wall of human skulls with little captions about how each person croaked; wax sculptures of what happens if your syphilis goes untreated; plaster molds of conjoined twins. Lots of babies with tails in jars and other very real things. I thought it would be a great idea to eat a huge breakfast at the wonderful K\u2019Far before I went\u2014get a Jerusalem bagel, one of each boreka, and a Yemenite latte, made with milk infused with ginger, cinnamon, and cardamom. I was able to hold it together. Plus, the flu exhibit was indeed all it was cracked up to be, complete with sneezing coughing sound effects. I\u2019ve been washing my hands like a surgeon ever since.Go there: The M\u00fctter MuseumMore Philly recs I got from Alex Delany that I loved: John\u2019s Roast Pork (duh!), Johnny Brenda\u2019s bar (beer!), Pizzeria Beddia (the white pie!), Khyber Pass Pub (beer!), Hungry Pigeon (the cocktails! The chicken!), and Primal Supply Meats (pork chops!).!!!!!Digital director Carey Polis was actually watching Jeopardy! when this clue popped onscreen. A thrill of a lifetime!How could you not?Cook, marry, killllllllllllllPhoto by Laura MurrayOn the BA podcast this week I gushed over my Highly Recommend for the Joan (pictured above). It\u2019s a glass of wine at The Riddler, a delightful champagne bar, filled to the rim. What else do you need to know? Related, I ranted about the stupid, confusing proposed wine tariff that could result in a 100 PERCENT tax on imported European wines (and other stuff\u2014tinned fish! Cheese! Olive oil!). If you ever buy wine, you should care. You don\u2019t want a $20 bottle suddenly $40, do ya? The New York Times said there could be \u201cdisastrous ripple effects\u201d as a result. The only ripple effects I want to see are the ones in my wine glass, filled to the top.Read more:Go to The Riddler. Get Your Wine Glass Filled to the Brim.The Insanity of Trump\u2019s Wine TariffsIn other newsThere\u2019s a new Girl Scout cookie this year. Lemon-Ups are lemon tea cookies with positive affirmations stamped on them, like I AM A LEADER. As someone who prefers more of a supporting role in life, I\u2019d be fine with tepid affirmations like, THAT SEEMS FINE. Or IT WASN\u2019T YOUR FAULT. But maybe that\u2019s why they didn\u2019t hire me to write them. There\u2019s always next year\u2014hey, that\u2019d be a good one!Do you thinkThe Kardashian-West house staff prepared their pantry and walk-in fridge for Kim\u2019s seemingly impromptu kitchen tour on Instagram this week? She wanted to prove wrong any \u201crefrigerator shamers\u201d that worried there wasn\u2019t any food in their house. Ah yes, what we needed: proof two celebrities are absurdly rich, multiple fridges and pantries overfloweth with fresh produce and snacks. Glad we cleared that up. I love transparency. \u201cPlant-based tacos are my favorite!\u201d she captioned one pic. Honestly, same.Unnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekWhat was the rutabaga question all about, Chaey? \u201cI was going to make a recipe with rutabaga in it. They\u2019re impossible to tell apart from a turnip on the outside, but apparently they taste different,\u201d she said. \u201c...I\u2019m not gonna make that recipe.\u201d Carla Lalli Music elaborated on her reply: \u201cRutabaga is the least desirable root in the cold storage bin, IMHO.\u201d \u201comg love a rutabag!\u201d slacked Mol\u2019 Baz, adding: \u201cBIG ASS TURNIPS\u201d \u201cI like them!!!!\u201d Sarah Jampel, who \u201croots for the underdog\u201d said, with four exclamation points and no pun intended. They\u2019re mild and sweet, not unlike a parsnip, she explained. In a segment about unloved root vegetables on the BA podcast this week, Brad Leone optimistically claims you can walk right by them in any grocery store, which I\u2019d say is factually inaccurate. \u201cRutabaga thoughts?\u201d I asked Andy Baraghani. \u201cDon\u2019t know her,\u201d he replied.Look how good these look tho!Photo by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Andy Baraghani, Prop Styling by Emily EisenGet the recipe for this PLANT-BASED TACO!
