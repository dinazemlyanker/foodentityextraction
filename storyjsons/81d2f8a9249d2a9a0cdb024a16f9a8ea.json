Drink it all year long.By Carlos MatiasFebruary 26, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Emma FishmanFacebookTwitterEmailThe airport officer opened my luggage and told me it couldn\u2019t go, pointing to the glass jug full of roots and herbs. He continued to inspect my bag and spotted the 300 Dominican pesos (about $5) I had placed next to the container, anticipating this scenario. He grabbed the money and sent me on my way. I\u2019ve learned that influencing an airport official at Punta Cana International is usually easier than finding the traditional ingredients for mamajuana in the U.S.Often referred to as Dominican Sangria, mamajuana is an infused and aged DIY cocktail made with tropical bark and herbs\u2014bohuco pega palo, alo de Brasil, and u\u00f1a de gato, to name a few. Sure, you can purchase packaged mixes of the ingredients on Amazon and Etsy, but since I can\u2019t vouch for their quality or authenticity, I use my own mix of star anise, hibiscus petals, allspice, cinnamon sticks, dried basil leaves, whole cloves, chicory root, eucalyptus, and ginger to approximate the flavors. As long as it\u2019s stuffed in a jug and steeped in aged rum, sweet red wine, and honey for at least a few days or up to several months, the results will resemble the amber-colored, dessert-rum-flavor of the local recipe. It\u2019s an excellent post-dinner digestif, nightcap, or last-minute hosting cocktail (when that becomes a thing again)\u2014and it\u2019s the only thing that gets me through New York\u2019s cold, harsh winters.My memories of strange brown stuff in clear bottles go back as far as I can remember. I recall conversations and parties quickly forming whenever there was a bottle around. It turned domino tables into stages, my cousins into professional merengue dancers, and made an excellent chaser for my favorite uncle\u2019s stories. My family rarely left me out of the action because tradition took precedence over underage drinking rules. \u201cGive him a little. It\u2019s not alcohol; it\u2019s mamajuana,\u201d my aunts would tell my parents.Photo by Emma FishmanAccording to my grandmother, it\u2019s the only flu vaccine she trusts, my cousins take shots of it before going out into the night\u2019s cold, and Porfirio Rubirosa, the Dominican James Bond, drank it because he believed it increased his libido. I can neither confirm nor deny either of these claims, but I can attest to the fact that (contrary to my aunts\u2019 assertions) the sweetness of the honey and spiciness of the herbs mask a high alcohol content that will sneak up on you if you\u2019re not careful.But the mamajuana wasn\u2019t always a boozy cocktail. Its roots can be traced back to the Ta\u00ednos, the Caribbean\u2019s indigenous people, who used the same mix of herbs to create a medicinal tea before European explorers added alcohol to the elixir. It was later banned under Rafael Trujillo\u2019s oppressive regime in the mid-1900s when the dictator discovered it was being used as an aphrodisiac. This only added to mamajuana\u2019s mysticism and popularity.The traditional formula varies from family to family, and even among family members, so recipes serve more as guidelines than directions. Depending on the mix and how long you let it sit, the taste can range from piney and woody to spicy and sweet, with hints of earthy cinnamon or licorice-like anise. It can go down smooth like a sip of wine or leave your tastebuds with a potent reminder, like a shot of absinthe. When I can\u2019t travel to get the ingredients locally\u2014or don\u2019t feel like risking a run-in with law enforcement\u2014I make my own using ingredients I can find Stateside. After a few undrinkable batches, some trial and error, and endless phone calls to my relatives, I perfected my version. Here\u2019s how I make it:Add 5 whole anise stars, 5 allspice berries, 8 hibiscus petals, 5 cinnamon sticks, 6 dried basil leaves, 5 whole cloves, 2 tablespoons chicory root, 4 eucalyptus leaves, and a 2\" piece of ginger root (cut so it fits through the mouth of the bottle) to a large glass jug or empty 750-ml liquor bottle. (The traditional recipe calls for curing the bark and herbs in wine first to get rid of the bitterness, but you can skip that step here). Fill the bottle with 1 part light or dark aged Dominican rum (I favor Brugal A\u00f1ejo dark rum, but a lesser aged rum will result in a sweeter mamajuana with less complexity), 1 part red wine (I like Malbec), and 4 Tbsp. honey. You can adjust the ratios to make it as sweet or as potent as you want. Let the ingredients steep for a month, shaking the bottle every few days to encourage extraction, and adding more wine and/or rum to adjust the flavor to your liking. You can start the process over with the same bottle of herbs until they start to lose their flavor.Some of my family say it doesn\u2019t live up to their versions, while others argue they can\u2019t tell the difference. One thing we do agree on is another round.Carlos Matias is a writer living in New York.
