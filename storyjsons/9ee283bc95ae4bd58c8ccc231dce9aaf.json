It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Claire foreverThe week started with a downpour of rain and a plastic bag full of t-shirts. We surprised Claire Saffitz with a potluck of her own recipes, made by the BA staff, and shirts that read \u201chalf-sour,\u201d because, well, this is hard news to share, but she\u2019s leaving us. To do great things! (You might still see her around. \ud83d\ude09) I made the cantaloupe-prosecco jelly above (mine looked nothing like Claire\u2019s), art assistant Annalee Soskin made Claire\u2019s Christmas gummies (hard!), editorial assistant Emma Wartzman made her peanut butter blondies, associate editor Christina Chaey made this sausage stir-fry (disappeared the fastest), visuals assistant Emma Fishman made the new ricotta panna cotta, and there were SO MANY MORE. I asked Claire what she would have made for herself on this occasion and she said: morning buns, sourdough, or BA\u2019s best buttermilk biscuits. Sense a theme?\u2764\ufe0f WE LOVE YOU CLAIRE!!! \u2764\ufe0fDrink the vinegarSweet, sour, unpalatable vinegar! For Healthyish, I spent too much time tasting \u201cdrinking vinegars,\u201d a new category of $4 drinks at a health store near you. Not quite kombucha\u2014mostly water with a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar\u2014these drinks can be close to delicious, while others tasted like Stevia-soaked sadness. Learn more about WHY this is such a thing, and which drinks, if any, you should try yourself, right over here. Just don\u2019t guzzle more than one a day; I found out the hard way.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Overheard in the BA officeA hushed whisper: \u201cSomeone\u2019s microwaving calamari.\u201dPhoto by Alex LauHot Hot 10Did you catch our big news of the week? The Hot 10 list dropped, aka the Best New Restaurants in America! I want to go to Oklahoma City! I thought the photos by Alex Lau were phenomenal, and had a special place in my heart for this bathroom shot inside the super stylish Freedman\u2019s in LA. I\u2019m picturing a line of people behind Lau, tapping their feet and doing a little dance, as he snapped the perfect portrait of that GOLD TOILET FLUSH LEVER.WhyWas Shia LaBeouf eating a steak with his bare hands this week? Dunno, but I am glad all of the gossip sites reported on it, because now I have something to think about when I\u2019m doing the dishes.Ramen heist!\u201cNearly $100,000 worth of Ramen Noodles was stolen in Georgia, according to police,\u201d tweeted FOX 5 DC. To which the world replied: HOW MUCH? And @alliz71 won the reply game:Unnecessary food feud of the weekSomeone picked up a mini yellow watermelon at the farmers\u2019 market this week and as we popped the triangular slices into our mouths, I asked Brad: \u201cWhat\u2019s better, yellow or red watermelon?\u201d In unison we replied: \u201cred.\u201d Everyone got along this week. It was for Claire.Chelsie CraigMust-readThis ros\u00e9 expos\u00e9!A correctionOops. In my last note, I confidently wrote that Cary Grant starred in It Happened One Night. It was Clark Gable, dummy! I got my swashbuckling, pomade-slicked stars crossed. I apologize for this egregious error. That said, I also baked a galette on wax paper; my flaws contain multitudes. I\u2019d like to send my regrets to: Grace, Chris, Debra, Jayne, Kathrynn, Ann, Porter, Maureen, Barbara, Kate, Lynn, Nancy, and Shelley, who felt the whole thing was \u201cReally dumb trivia. Boring!!!\u201d Sorry, Shelley!To make up for itHere\u2019s a very, very good recipe.Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
