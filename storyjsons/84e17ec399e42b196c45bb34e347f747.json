The Hut is staffed mainly by students riding high on the spirit of summer break and lobster rolls. We spoke to Parker Sikora, Colby College student and model employee, on what life is like behind the counter.What were you looking for in a summer job?I joined the team in May 2015. I reached out to a friend who was working at Bob\u2019s already. She was actually my prom date her senior year. I said, \u201cWhy do you go back to this place every summer?\u201d And she was like, \u201cCome find out.\u201dIf you\u2019re cooking yourself, might we suggest this Skillet Cod, Clams, and Corn with Parsley?\nPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Susie Theodorou, prop styling by Emily EisenHow do you deal with the seafood smell?There\u2019s a tradition we have when an employee leaves the Hut for the last time: We take a video of them tossing their shoes in the dumpster, because the floor gets so clammy with juice and flour for breading.Any daily strategies for dealing with the funk?It\u2019s tough. It\u2019s fresh seafood; you can smell it. We change our gloves often. But in my experience, I find flour everywhere. In my socks, on my back, in my hair. That was something I didn\u2019t expect. You never know where you\u2019re going to find flour.What do you eat on the job?There\u2019s a joke: No one eats seafood on break. We go for a chicken salad, we go for a grilled cheese, we go for a burger.Why the Crocs? See questions No. 2.\nPhoto by Elizabeth CecilFavorite seafood prep task?Portioning! Going through and separating lobster meat. It feels good to make sure every lobster roll has a claw and tail. Having eaten a fair share of lobster rolls myself, I know that\u2019s what I like to see. There are some tasks that are more hands-on. Cutting the calamari is really unpopular with people who don\u2019t like calamari.What do you do with all the clamshells?We get them without the shells. We do reuse the clam buckets. You never know what\u2019s going to be in a clam bucket, so we label it all. Forks. Knives. Carrot sticks.Now we know you\u2019re in the mood for more seafood:Explore Bon App\u00e9titClamSeafoodRestaurants + TravelRead MoreLifestyleThe Best Way to Buy Sustainable Seafood?
