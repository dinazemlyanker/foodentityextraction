She would complete the third recipe in BA\u2019s tri-color collection (all the hues of the Italian flag!) and gift the world another stupidly simple, and addictively delicious nutty, cheesy, just-throw-it-in-the-food-processor pasta sauce.The way she would get there? Take a once-lauded ingredient and give it a comeback for the ages. \u201cI was convinced that I was going to be able to make sundried tomatoes cool again,\u201d she told me, hoping to restore our faith in the 1980s star that had fallen from grace.Turns out, the ingredient was no Winona Ryder. \u201cNo matter what I did to them, I couldn\u2019t get the sundried tomatoes to lose their astringent flavor,\u201d Molly says. \u201cAfter five failed attempts, I realized that they don\u2019t deserve to come back. I was nearly ready to give up on Red Pesto altogether.\u201dBut Molly is no quitter. Instead, she decided to scrap everything and give it one more go. \u201cI realized that the sauce was too raw\u2014too intense,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there\u2019s no rule declaring a pesto can\u2019t have cooked elements. So I landed on tomato paste.\u201d (Tomato paste, by nature, needs to be cooked so as to lose its tinny taste.) The key then was to bring the sauce back to bring back the bright and fresh feeling pesto usually offers, so along with the more traditional ingredients\u2014nuts (in this case, walnuts), garlic, Parmesan, and olive oil\u2014she added anchovies (for umami!), lemon juice (for zing!), and Fresno chiles (for heat!).The end result\u2014glossed up with a couple of tablespoons of butter, of course\u2014is a cross between the savory anchovy-garlic dip bagna cauda and a spicy arrabbiata. It\u2019s total dynamite, especially for something that comes together so quickly. Really! It takes less time to cook the first few ingredients than it does to snip the leaves off of a big bunch of basil.\u201cWho knows,\u201d Molly says, now undaunted by the thought of turning anything into a pesto. \u201cMaybe there will be a new color down the line.\u201dGet the recipe:Red Pesto PastaThis red pesto tastes like a mash-up of your favorite spicy arrabbiata sauce and the anchovy-garlic dip bagna cauda. All of which is to say, it\u2019s delicious.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPestoPastaTomato PasteWalnutParmesanRead MorecookingWhite Pesto Is The Easiest Dinner You Will Make This WeekBy Emma WartzmancookingHow to Prevent Your Herbs From Wasting Away in the FridgeBy Sarah JampelcultureThe Test Kitchen Swears By This Mini Food ProcessorBy Zo\u00eb SessumscookingThis Pesto Potato Salad Doesn't Know It's BeautifulBy Carey PolisRecipes you want to make.
