Cooking the chicken in a lidded pot over low heat lets the bird gently steam, resulting in meat that\u2019s juicier than if you roasted it uncovered.

Gratifying to make!AnonymousPhiladelphia5/4/2020Deee-licious!  The juciest, most flavorful, easiest way to prepare a perfect chicken.  We all loved it!  My husband said that he thought it was the very best way to prepare a chicken - and being in our 60's we have eaten a lot of chickens.   Definitely doing this again!  In fact, this recipe made me decide to renew my subscription.  BTW- I added the dressing to the glazed vegetables and just cooked it down.  So good!Sunny Florida!4/20/2018The flavour of everything was great but I had to remove a lot of cooking liquid from the pot to get the vegetables to glaze. AnonymousGA3/3/2018The chicken and vegetables were fine but the sauce is really tasty, and just drizzling the sauce over the top of the chicken and vegetables seems like a waste.  Next time I would pass the sauce separately so that it can be spooned directly over the sliced chicken.  In fact, the sauce is so easy and fast that I would make it to jazz up rotisserie chicken when time is short.  Also, I added the crushed red pepper with the garlic and oil, instead of adding it after the garlic was browned.AnonymousDunedin, Florida2/21/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titChickenPoultryCarrotVegetableMainGluten-FreeNut-FreeHealthyishRoastEasterRosh HashanahPassoverDinnerRecipes you want to make.
