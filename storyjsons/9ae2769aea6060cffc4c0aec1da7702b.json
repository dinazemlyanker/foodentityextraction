When we entertain, we want everyone to have fun\u2014including the host. Enter posole, one of the tastiest, prettiest one-pot dishes on earth. Make ahead and all that\u2019s left to do is ice some beers and set out all the toppings. This is no-stress party food for the win.Ingredients12 servings Posole1\u00bdlb. dried large white hominy, soaked overnight2large onions, peeled2bay leaves6black peppercorns3Tbsp. kosher salt, divided4lb. bone-in country-style pork ribs1Tbsp. ground cumin6garlic cloves, finely choppedChile Pur\u00e9e and Assembly2\u00bdoz. dried New Mexico chiles2\u00bdoz. ancho chiles1large onion, coarsely chopped6garlic cloves, crushed\u00bccup apple cider vinegar2tsp. light brown sugar1tsp. kosher salt, plus moreAvocado wedges, cilantro sprigs, thinly sliced cabbage, sliced jalape\u00f1os, sliced radishes, lime wedges, sour cream, tortilla chips, and hot sauce (for serving)PreparationPosoleStep 1Drain hominy and place in a large heavy pot; add onions, bay leaves, peppercorns, 2 Tbsp. salt, and 12 cups water. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer, still covered, stirring occasionally, until hominy starts to soften (some skins will split), about 1 hour.Step 2Sprinkle pork all over with cumin and remaining 1 Tbsp. salt. Add to pot along with garlic; pour in water to cover by 1\". Partially cover pot and cook, stirring occasionally and adding more water as needed to keep ingredients covered, until hominy is tender (some may unfurl like popped popcorn, and that\u2019s okay) and pork is fall-apart tender, about 2\u00bd hours.Chile Pur\u00e9e and AssemblyStep 3While the posole is cooking, make the chile pur\u00e9e. Wearing gloves if you have them, remove stems from chiles and shake out and discard most of the seeds (for more heat, keep more seeds). Transfer to a large bowl and add onion and garlic; pour in boiling water to cover. Let sit until chiles are softened, about 30 minutes.Step 4Drain chile mixture, reserving soaking liquid, and transfer chiles, onion, and garlic to a blender. Add vinegar, brown sugar, 1 tsp. salt, and 1 cup soaking liquid and blend until smooth.Step 5When posole is done, remove pork, onions, and bay leaves from pot (keep posole simmering). Transfer pork to a plate; discard onions and bay leaves. Let pork cool slightly, then pick meat from bones, discarding any cartilage and larger pieces of fat. Shred meat into bite-size pieces and return to pot; discard bones.Step 6Stir chile pur\u00e9e into posole and let simmer 30 minutes to allow flavors to meld. Taste and season with more salt.Step 7Divide posole among bowls. Serve with avocado, cilantro, cabbage, jalape\u00f1os, radishes, lime wedges, sour cream, tortilla chips, and hot sauce alongside for topping.Step 8Do Ahead: Posole can be made 4 days ahead. Let cool, then cover and chill.Read More: The 29 New Essential Recipes from the Bon App\u00e9tit Test KitchenHow would you rate Party Posole Rojo?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleThis is a no-fail recipe that my food-obsessed friends go crazy for!lifeofpieNYC6/5/2021This sounds amazing but for those of us that do not eat pork-- would beef ribs work??Stephanie2/21/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titPosoleSoupSoups and StewsMexicanLatin AmericanHominyRice & GrainsAncho ChileChileVegetablePork RibPorkMeatOne-Pot MealsMainNut-FreeSimmerDinnerRecipes you want to make.
