Old-school Filipinx cooks make the sauce for it from scratch, but you can find powdered or jarred versions, the best of which is Fila Manila Kare-Kare. It\u2019s the star of this dish, where it cooks down with garlic, thyme, chicken broth, butter, lemon juice, and hot sauce into a glossy sauce for seared shrimp. This peanut-y sauce is perfect with virtually any shellfish\u2014try it with head-on prawns or lobster if you want to go all in. \u2014Harold VillarosaAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Makes loads and freezes well - I serve with fluffy jasmine rice, spring onions (scallions) fish-sauce-pickled cucumbers and chilli and some quickly tossed up samphire to make a proper week-day meal. Works really well with Fried tofu too!
