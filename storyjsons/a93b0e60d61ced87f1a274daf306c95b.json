At its core a Mai Tai is meant to showcase great rum. We use a combination of white and aged or dark rums\u2014the white rum is lighter bodied and fruity, while the aged rum brings juicy banana, vanilla, and burnt sugar notes and a richer mouthfeel. High-quality orgeat is essential (we love L\u2019Orgeat) and is worth seeking out if you\u2019re a fan of tropical drinks. If you\u2019re making Mai Tais for a crowd, this recipe easily scales up. Simply make a large batch in a pitcher or jar and shake 4 oz. cocktail mixture in a shaker with ice to make one drink.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Just made a sample (single recipe) - really good!Janie MasonHouston, TX8/20/2021Please post the batch measurements if you suggest making a batch! You know, we need a pitcher. After one BA cocktail; my math gets fuzzy. I second the Trader Vic\u2019s sentiment. \u270c\ud83c\udffbJeanetteChicago8/15/2021I miss Trader Vic's so bad!
