But before I can even consider what I\u2019ll be cooking in the Test Kitchen all day, I\u2019m figuring out how to get exactly what I\u2019m craving for breakfast. That\u2019s why if I had it my way, I\u2019d start every morning at Larrys\u2014a small but mighty all-day cafe in Montreal that makes breakfast a choose-your-own-adventure experience. Rather than a series of elaborately composed dishes, the menu at Larrys is one long list of small, mix-and-match plates, meaning I can order exactly what it is I need that day, and cut out everything else. If I\u2019m feeling like I need some protein, I\u2019ll grab a single scrambled egg, a housemade sausage link, and a side of house-smoked salmon. Or maybe it\u2019s the marinated lentils and a plate of crispy brown-buttered oyster mushrooms that call my name. Or perhaps it\u2019s a morning like this morning, and a soul-warming Bolognese Toast (i.e. a study in how to eat pasta for breakfast) and a side of crispy potatoes is just the thing I need. Don\u2019t judge me, it\u2019s my breakfast. You can order whatever you want.Go There: LarrysExplore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsHighly RecommendMontrealBreakfastRecipes you want to make.
