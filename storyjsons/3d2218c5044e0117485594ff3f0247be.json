Like, I'll make a recipe just as an excuse to eat lots of sesame seeds. (Hi, grilled beef with broccoli!) But I had always stuck to plain sesame seeds. You know, heeding the advice I learned in sesame seed business school: KISS (Keep it simple, stupid). That is, until I met yuzu furikake.I wasn\u2019t looking to upgrade my sesame seed game, but one night at Whole Foods I noticed a new addition. A sprinkling yuzu furikake from the brand From Japan. This sounded exactly like the next step in my relationship with sesame seeds.I was familiar with furikake (a seasoning that includes dried seaweed, dried fish, sugar, salt, and often MSG) pre-purchase, but not I-feel-compelled-to-buy-this familiar. However yuzu, a Japanese citrus fruit, is my jam. I go through ponzu like it\u2019s conditioner but soy sauce like it\u2019s shampoo. And yuzu kosho is my hot sauce soulmate. I was sold. I threw my From Japan yuzu furikake in my cart and headed out.You can sprinkle furikake on nearly everything (like hard-boiled eggs!).\nDanny KimWhen I got home I immediately threw some rice in my rice cooker so I could test drive the seasoning. It had the obvious furikake components I had seen from posting this recipe SO MANY times on Bon App\u00e9tit's Facebook page, but also mixed throughout were dried pieces of yuzu zest. I sprinkled some into the palm of my hand then poured it into my mouth like I was eating Buncha Crunch at the movies. At first you get lots of ocean vibes from the seaweed and salt-cured black sesame seeds, but then you\u2019re hit with citrus insanity from the yuzu. Dang.I took my finished rice, and dusted it in the furikake. The furikake brought a ton of flavor (more than plain sesame seeds would), but the snack still felt clean and light. Since then I\u2019ve experimented with sprinkling it on spicy chicken, roasted broccoli, and healthyish salads. Needless to say, my sesame seed sprinkling game has improved greatly.\u00a0Buy it: Organic Sprinkling Yuzu Japanese Furikake, $11 at ChefShop.com (or at Whole Foods)Sprinkle furikake on this kombu salmon:Explore Bon App\u00e9titJapaneseWere Into ItSpiceSeaweedCondiment/SpreadShoppingBA RecommendsRead MorecultureWe Love Ozuk\u00e9's Umeboshi, a New Take on Traditional Japanese Fermented PlumsBy Elyssa GoldbergcookingThe Cooking Pot You'll Never Want to Put in a DrawerBy Amiel StanektechniquesA Guide to Easy Japanese Home-CookingBy Amiel StanekcultureThe Japanese Breakfast You Can Actually Make on a Weekday MorningBy Elyssa GoldbergRecipes you want to make.
