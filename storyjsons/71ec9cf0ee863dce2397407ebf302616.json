Delegators assign. They\u2019ll tell you to bring the cranberry sauce, they\u2019ll tell you when it\u2019s time to serve the pie, and they\u2019ll make you write place cards even though you\u2019re all family and no one needs to be told where to sit.The doers in my family, and I count myself among them, are extreme. We say \u201cGive me a job\u201d like if you don\u2019t comply we\u2019ll fall into a pit of uselessness. This makes for quite a scene at Thanksgiving, all of us hovering over each other, going out to get extra ice when the freezer is clearly full, taking a single seltzer can out to the recycling bin so as not to burden anyone else.We learned this behavior from my grandfather. He and my grandmother were the ultimate delegator-doer pair. She navigated; he drove. She set the menu; he was her sous. They played a lot of doubles tennis, and I can only imagine how it worked on the court. (Maybe there\u2019s a reason my grandfather switched to golf.)Our Thanksgivings weren\u2019t always in the same place, but my grandfather\u2019s role was always the same. He\u2019d tie on an apron and start washing and peeling the potatoes\u2014the third worst Thanksgiving task. He\u2019d peel every pearl onion\u2014the second worst job. In between, he\u2019d handle the brussels sprouts, rinsing and trimming and scoring the bottom of every one. The worst Thanksgiving job, obviously, is doing the dishes. Of course, he handled that too, washing every piece of silver by hand.Amanda and her grandfather on Block Island, Rhode Island, in 1996.\nCourtesy of Amanda ShapiroOver the years we\u2019d try to beat back my grandfather from the kitchen. We\u2019d get him to sit on the couch with the newspaper and a glass of wine, but inevitably, 20 minutes in, he\u2019d be up and pacing again. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201dAs my grandparents got older, they traveled less and less, spending Thanksgivings at their retirement home instead. My grandfather bred a pretty neurotic bunch of doers, but even we couldn\u2019t match his dedication to the most loathed, least appreciated jobs. Our potatoes were pockmarked with errant knife stabs, our brussels sprouts trimmed carelessly and one time not at all.In the last couple years, my grandmother had a series of falls that left her frail. She became even more of a delegator and my grandfather even more the vigilant doer. He\u2019d set the table in their kitchenette for the next day\u2019s breakfast as soon as that day\u2019s was done. When my grandmother was moved to a different wing for round-the-clock care, he\u2019d spend all day fetching one thing after another from their apartment at the slightest suggestion of need: a pack of tissues, another sweater, her favorite comb. It seemed a little masochistic, all this doing, but it also seemed like the only thing keeping him sane.When someone you\u2019ve cared for dies, there are plenty of logistics to handle, but there is also, suddenly, very little to do. Since my grandmother died last spring, my grandfather\u2014chief executive doer for 67 years of marriage\u2014has been grieving, as expected. He\u2019s also been learning to not do. Every day he sits in his armchair and meditates. He goes to Quaker meetings. When we visit, he allows us to do things for him, running errands, making his breakfast toast. And if we\u2019re lucky, he lets us wash the dishes when he\u2019s done.Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
