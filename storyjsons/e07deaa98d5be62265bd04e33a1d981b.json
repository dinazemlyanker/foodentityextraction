(No, It\u2019s Not Marzipan)This might drive you nuts.By Sarah JampelDecember 22, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhotograph by Emma Fishman. \u00a0Food Styling by Micah MortonFacebookTwitterEmailSome arrangements in the grocery store seem designed for trickery. The coconut milk is right alongside the lite coconut milk, the peanut butter is indistinguishable from the peanut butter spread, and don\u2019t get me started on the proximity of the cucumbers and the zucchini, the jalape\u00f1os and the serranos, and the parsley and the cilantro.Same goes for the almond paste and the marzipan, two nearly identical tubes among the chocolate chips and toffee bits in the baking aisle. While almond paste and marzipan share almonds and sugar as their core ingredients, they\u2019re far from interchangeable. So what\u2019s the difference between almond paste and marzipan, and when do you use each?What\u2019s the difference between almond paste and marzipan?As Luisa Weiss writes in her book Classic German Baking, almond paste, a foundational ingredient in many German baked goods, \u201cis nothing more than almonds and sugar processed together so finely that they turn into paste.\u201d It\u2019s soft, moist, relatively coarse, and a bit gritty. Rather than being a treat on its own, it\u2019s often incorporated into recipes as an ingredient: creamed into cake batters and cookie doughs to add almond flavor, sweetness, moisture, and chew; rolled out and tucked into brownies, pies, tarts, and galettes; cut into cubes and folded into scones, muffins, and quick breads for soft pockets of nuttiness.Can you spy the thin layer of almond paste in these brownies?\nPhoto by Alex LauCompared to almond paste, marzipan has a higher proportion of sugar, which makes it sweeter, smoother, and more pliable\u2014think Play-Doh. It\u2019s typically rolled, molded, dyed, and/or shaped (like into these adorable fruits!) and served as its own or used as a decorative element in larger desserts. Depending on where in the world you are, marzipan might come from the store flavored\u2014in Germany, for example, it often contains rose water.Can I use almond paste and marzipan interchangeably?Will you hate me if I say no? The two products are different enough that, just like those near-doppelg\u00e4ngers cucumbers and zucchini, you shouldn\u2019t be swapping them willy-nilly.You can, however, MacGyver marzipan from almond paste by mixing it with additional sugar in the form of powered sugar, simple syrup, and/or corn syrup. And, while you can\u2019t make almond paste from marzipan, you can make almond paste at home fairly easily.How can I make almond paste at home?All you need is a food processor and a bit of patience. In Classic German Baking, Weiss instructs pur\u00e9eing blanched almonds with sugar, almond extract, and rum until you have a very smooth paste, which could take 10 minutes if not longer. Use the almond paste immediately or store it in the refrigerator, where it keeps for several weeks.Or take a shortcut and use almond flour instead of whole nuts. In The King Arthur Baking Company\u2019s All-Purpose Baker\u2019s Companion, almond paste is made by combining almonds with powdered sugar, almond extract, and pasteurized egg whites (some almond paste recipes contain egg whites, others do not), then kneading the mixture by hand until it holds together. If you\u2019re seeking out the light color and delicate texture of commercially made almond paste, be sure to use almond flour that\u2019s made from blanched (i.e., naked) almonds\u2014the pesky skins would make for a darker paste with a deeper flavor.But then there\u2019s frangipane...Frangipane contains eggs, butter, and flour in addition to ground almonds and sugar (there\u2019s sometimes liquor, juice, cocoa powder, or spices too!). It\u2019s a much looser mixture that\u2019s made at home (rather than purchased in the store) and used, most commonly, as a filling in pies, cookies, and pastries\u2014it puffs lightly in the oven and takes on a rich chewy-tender texture. To confuse things more, frangipane can be made with almond paste as its foundation (which allows you to skip grinding almonds or almond flour entirely!), and also without almonds\u2014and without nuts, what?!\u2014entirely.If all of this seems confusing, just remember that while almond paste, marzipan, and frangipane are all members of the almonds-mixed-with-sugar family, they\u2019re individuals. Treat them as such and know your baked goods (and displays of miniature edible snowpeople!) thank you.Have almond paste, will make cookiesCocoa-Coffee Almond CookiesAlmond paste makes these supremely fudgy cookies extra chewy, while coffee adds a savory note that complements the chocolate and nut flavors.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
