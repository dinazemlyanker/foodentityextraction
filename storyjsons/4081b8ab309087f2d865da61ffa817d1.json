That\u2019s what I had always been told, at least. You\u2019re paying too much for the wines you\u2019re given. You\u2019re getting too much or too little to drink. You\u2019re asking to have your meal interrupted by some ego-tripping sommelier. Who wants any of that?But then I booked a solo meal at Beckon in Denver, a 2019 Top 50 finalist and tasting menu-only sister restaurant to 2018 Hot 10 winner Call, while I was in town visiting my sister last spring. It was one of those new fangled ticketed sort of deals\u2014pay upfront for eight courses, whatever additions you want, tax, and tip\u2014and I opted to add the (very affordable!) $65 wine pairing, mostly because I was tickled by the idea that I wouldn\u2019t even have to take out my credit card to pay for drinks at the end of the meal. Aside from thinking that it sounded extremely convenient, I didn\u2019t give much thought to the fact that I was doing exactly the opposite of what I had always been told. Which is particularly funny, considering the thing I\u2019ve been thinking about for the better part of this year is actually the wine pairing by Zachary Byers, Beckon\u2019s sommelier.To be clear: I loved the food at Beckon. Every course that chef Duncan Holmes and his team passed across the counter to me was fresh and fascinating, made with equal parts care and creativity. But for the first time in my life, the wine I was being poured positively electrified the food. Barely cooked California spot prawns lolling about in a verdant green spring gazpacho was delicious on its own but transcendent alongside a salty, floral albari\u00f1o from Monterey, California. I went from standing on a cliff overlooking the Pacific to hang-gliding over it. Monkfish in a gripping mussel broth found its voice in between sips of an off-dry Alsatian pinot gris, its honeyed sweetness just evanescing off the brine of the seafood. The experience of each course in its totality was so captivating that I kept forgetting that there was more to come.But the brilliance of Byers\u2019s pairings went beyond the gustatory; they made me think. And not because he was speechifying with every pour\u2014he deftly dispensed just enough information about each wine to clarify without confounding\u2014but because I was experiencing something new with each glass. Come to think of it, I hadn\u2019t had albari\u00f1o from California before. If I\u2019m not a person who \u201clikes sweet wines,\u201d then why was that pinot gris so damn delicious? I thought about how special and rare it was to drink wines made by two female winemakers in a row\u2014and then thought about how depressing it is for that to be special and rare. It\u2019s easy for one\u2019s mind to wander when dining alone in a situation like this, but I was riveted, present, there the entire time. All that for the price of a middling bottle at another restaurant? Yes, yes, and yes!When I talked to Byers later about my prejudice against wine pairings and how surprised I was by his, he confirmed that this was all by design. \u201cBeverage programs are responsible for a lot of the profit at restaurants, and a lot of people take advantage of that when it comes to wine pairings,\u201d he explained. \u201cI\u2019m trying to bring that cost right up to the limit, and I feel like I would be cheating people if I didn\u2019t do that.\u201d And in trying to keep the wine affordable, Byers often ends up seeking out high quality, off-the-beaten-path bottles that don\u2019t command the exorbitant price points of more recognizable grapes and regions. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to get to play with people\u2019s preconceived expectations,\u201d he shared. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve learned over the years is that there\u2019s a good version of everything and a perfect context, and when you can get those things together, you can really open people\u2019s eyes to something special.\u201d I wasn\u2019t just presented with the wines that I should be drinking, in that particular moment with that particular plate of food, but the amazing wines I could be drinking if I got out of my comfort zone, thought a little bit harder, explored more boldly.More than anything, my meal at Beckon was a reminder of how rewarding it can be to take a chance, to put yourself in someone else\u2019s hands and have the gamble pay off. \u201cTrust is such a huge thing, and a really fragile thing,\u201d Byers said. \u201cIf someone is giving it to you, then you have to make sure not to mess it up.\u201d And if more sommeliers start thinking like that, then there are going to be a whole lot more wine pairings in my future.Go there: BeckonExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsDenverWineRead MorecultureWhy You Should Get Down with an All-Beer Pairing Instead of Boring Old WineBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
