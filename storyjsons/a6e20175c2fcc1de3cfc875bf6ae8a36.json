Breathe in, breathe out.By Emily SchultzOctober 22, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Andrea TejedaFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.My Co-Star app tells me that my Virgo moon and rising signs make me a planner. It\u2019s clear when I go on vacation. The Google maps, intense itineraries, and saved Instagram posts prove this. But you can\u2019t plan every single minute of your vacation, especially when you\u2019re with seven of your closest friends in Mexico City. And for that, I thank Entremar.If you know anything about Mexico City (or have followed the BA staff on Instagram recently), you\u2019ve probably heard of Contramar, chef Gabriela C\u00e1mara\u2019s iconic seafood restaurant. And you\u2019re probably all too familiar with the food: that butterflied grilled fish, carefully painted with red and green salsas; a plate of four pristine tuna tostadas topped with slivers of avocado; and the mints at the end of the meal stamped with the \u201cContramar\u201d logo. So you know the deal. Immediately after you book your flight to Mexico City and secure the perfect Airbnb in Condesa or Roma Norte, you make your Contramar reservation. Right? Well kids, I didn\u2019t do that.Somehow I forgot to make that essential reservation until it was too late. On top of that, we were a party of eight in the city during a long weekend, which meant the restaurant was busy. As in there was no way we\u2019d get seated, and I was panicking. (I define FOMO by the food I\u2019m not eating in a specific moment.) I needed to have that grilled snapper! I yearned for the tuna tostada! And that\u2019s when Entremar saved the day.Contramar\u2019s helpful staff directed me to the restaurant\u2019s the much-lesser-known sister spot mid-meltdown. It\u2019s got nearly the exact same menu\u2014and somehow none of the hype. We slipped into Entremar on our last night in the city, and it was everything I dreamed of. We ate the perfectly charred fish with still-warm tortillas, those freakin\u2019 tuna tostadas that I still think about, and succulent stone crabs, a new favorite. Sure the mints at the end weren\u2019t stamped with Contramar, but they did bear the name of a place that means so much more to me now: Entremar.Go there: EntremarExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendMexico CityRestaurantsRecipes you want to make.
