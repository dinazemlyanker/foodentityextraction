We skipped the sausage to make it vegetarian and it was still full of flavor.  We couldn't find caciocavallo cheese so used a combo of regular and aged provolone.  \n\nThe recipe is definitely time consuming, with pricey ingredients, so I would only make it as-written for a special occasion.  That being said, I think you can definitely take some shortcuts and the salad would still be delicious.  The salata was pretty unnoticable, and I think you could use a less costly cheese in place of the caciocavallo and still get a lot of flavor out of it.  Perhaps subbing another kind of olive, or replacing with something else would also be another option. I think artichokes would be really good here...overall, super flavorful and fun to try.AnonymousChicago, IL11/13/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladItalianEuropeanKabocha SquashSquashVegetableAcorn SquashBrussels SproutRadicchioChicoryLeafy GreensRicotta SalataRicottaCheeseSalamiCured MeatMeatMainSideHealthyishSaut\u00e9LunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
