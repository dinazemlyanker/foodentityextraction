Next up, associate editor Ali Francis makes the case for Granola Butter.A few years ago I started experiencing a strange sweating sensation after eating nut butter. I am not a scientist, but I\u2019d guess the ailment had something to do with the way I consumed it: Heaping spoonfuls straight to the gob. Over time the idea of nut butter made me sicker than Bruce Bogtrotter (a.k.a., that kid from Matilda who loses it when he\u2019s forced to eat an entire chocolate cake). But avoiding it altogether left a Skippy-shaped hole in my heart. What would I spread on toast? Dollop into smoothies? Eat straight off the spoon? I needed something that was like nut butter but not.Luckily, the Instagram algorithm heard my plea\u2014it\u2019s listening right now\u2014and delivered the solution: Oat Haus Granola Butter. Made from oats, flax, olive oil, maple syrup, coconut oil, and spices, it\u2019s nut butter\u2019s younger, more complex cousin. (It\u2019s also nut-, dairy-, soy-, gluten-, and GMO-free, which is great if you swing that way.) Each flavor combines a cinnamon-y granola vibe with a texture that\u2019s similar to slightly-grainy-in-a-good-way tahini. Meaning, it\u2019s easier to drizzle over ice cream than your average store-bought PB, but it\u2019s not so runny that you can\u2019t slather it on toast. Nut butter wishes it were Granola Butter.Photograph by Isa Zapata. \u00a0Prop Styling by Paige HicksOat Haus Organic Original Granola Butter$13 at Amazon$10 at Thrive MarketThe Strawberry Shortcake, my favorite flavor of the bunch, is laced with freeze-dried strawberries for a sweet-tart kick. A spoonful of Vanilla Granola Butter is luxe and creamy, like a scoop of cake batter. The Original is akin to eating a liquified, buttery oatmeal raisin cookie\u2014only without the chunky raisins. And the Chocolate is rich enough to squash afternoon office cravings but not so sweet that you\u2019ll fall asleep while typing. You can order individual jars willy-nilly, of course, but all four come in the best-sellers variety pack, which is a better value and more realistic; once you start eating this stuff it\u2019s impossible to stop.Oat Haus Organic Chocolate Granola Butter$13 at Amazon$10 at Thrive MarketDespite it being a nutritious and allergen-free product, I also love that the super-playful Oat Haus brand centers flavor over \u201cfunction.\u201d According to cofounder and creator Ali Bonar, that was by design. After a decade struggling with disordered eating, she wanted to develop a product that made food fun again. \u201cI spent so many years fearing it, and that\u2019s no way to live,\u201d Bonar says. \u201cFood should be emotional. It should be how we connect with others, it should bring us joy, it's meant to be played with.\u201dWhen temps drop into the 30s, I like to go big on the cozy and spoon whichever GB flavor I see in my pantry first over hot porridge. Artfully blooped on yogurt with some coconut, berries, and seeds is an obvious but worthwhile choice. Slather it on sourdough and top it with fruit. Fill an ice-cube tray with Granola Butter, freeze it overnight, and you\u2019ve got fudge-like cubes you can snack on whenever the mood strikes. And I just noticed this GB & J \u2018quesadilla\u2019 recipe on the Oat Haus Instagram account, which is exactly how I\u2019m going to empty my last jar. No sweat: I\u2019ve got another variety pack en route.Granola on the brain?Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
