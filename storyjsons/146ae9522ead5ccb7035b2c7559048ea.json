It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Who\u2019s cooking stuff?Sarah Jampel made Claire Saffitz\u2019s blistered asparagus with a peanut-coconut sprinkle (not as complicated as it sounds!). \u201cCooking the asparagus in a super hot pan blisters the outsides and chars the tips without making the insides go to mush. And even if the stalks do slacken more than you\u2019d like, there\u2019s a crunchy peanut-coconut topping to make you forget about it.\u201dGet the recipe: Blistered Asparagus with Peanut-Coconut SprinklePhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Andy BaraghaniEmily Schultz made Andy Baraghani\u2019s fattet hummus, from his Lebanese recipe story (I want to make them ALL). Pita gets crisped up in oil, then you use it to scoop up garlicky-lemony yogurt, warm chickpeas, and crunchy cashews. \u201cIt comes together in literally 15 minutes,\u201d she said, \u201cand is the perfect meal to eat on your couch. We normally have a no-eating on the couch rule, but my roommate is out of town this week so\u2026\u201d Hi Chrissy!!Get the recipe: Fattet HummusWant this letter before it hits the website?

I\u2019d never sent a quicker RSVP! The treats are \u201cinspired by the things I cook at home at the Ranch,\u201d said the charming and delightful PW around a rustic wooden table surrounded by dog-loving writers. The treat flavors include Beef & Brisket and Strawberry Shortcake, Chicken & Blueberry Waffles, and more. Her own pups\u2019 favorite is Chicken & Sweet Taters. To my right, a writer for People Pets filled me in on Jake Gyllenhaal\u2019s very cute new cat, and to the left, a writer expounded on a tale of a Lab who ate stairs. Stairs! I went home with a goodie bag of treats for a dog I don\u2019t own, so I opened them up and gave each a little nibble. The beef and brisket had a strong smoky steak sauce aroma, and I got a hard bit of gristle in my bite, leaving a leathery aftertaste in my mouth. The strawberry shortcake had a butterfly imprint on it and resembled a tiny pie. It was hard and crumbly but not too different from any British digestive biscuit, lots of oat flour flavor and a hint of strawberry\u2014just barely. With a cup of coffee, ya coulda fooled me.MUST READHave you read this interview with the dentist-turned-line cook at BA\u2019s No. 1 restaurant in America in 2018, Nonesuch? Read it now! \u201cFor people my age or in the middle of their working lives, it takes courage to pursue a passion, to reinvent yourself. It\u2019s scary to go out into the unknown.\u201d And think about what you do in life that makes you feel this way: happy.Another oneAnd there are SO MANY great exchanges in this conversation about the Instant Pot between Priya Krishna and the goddess Madhur Jaffrey, like when Jaffrey tsktsks Priya for not soaking her dal overnight because she\u2019s too lazy. \u201cWhat are you complaining about? You\u2019re not doing any work! You are putting them in a bowl and leaving them. Don\u2019t get so lazy you can\u2019t even soak beans,\u201d she says. Now I want \u201cDon\u2019t get so lazy you can\u2019t even soak beans\u201d on a motivational poster with Jaffrey\u2019s face on it, stat.Unnecessary food meme of the weekAndy's boot campA handful of staffers went to Vegas last weekend for Vegas Uncork\u2019d and every morning they started the day with Andy\u2019s Boot Camp, a grueling hotel gym workout led by Andy Baraghani. \u201cLots of arms...and legs,\u201d said Rachel Karten. \u201cI\u2019m still sore from it.\u201d There were vertical jumps! Kettlebells! \u201cThey had great spirit and tremendous potential,\u201d said coach Andy. And then they spent the rest of the day eating. One meal highlight, Christina Chaey told me, was at Beijing Noodle No. 9, where they ate \u201cbeautiful juicy pork and shrimp dumplings, hand-pulled noodles,\u201d and stared at a wall of live goldfish while they dined. Chaey lost $20 in under 20 seconds at the slots, and Andy lost \u201cmore money in a short time than I\u2019ve seen anyone lose money,\u201d recounted Alex Delany. The celebrity chef highlight of the weekend was Gordon Ramsay holding Lisa Vanderpump\u2019s fluffy Pomeranian on the red carpet.This calamari is from Ferdinando\u2019s Focacceria in Brooklyn, NY.\nPhoto by Emily SchultzAt the Golden Steer Steakhouse in Vegas, the BA staff argued about where you would never order calamari. Well, mostly they corrected Adam Rapoport, who feels calamari should be ordered in seafood restaurants only, not steakhouses. Then he proceeded to eat half the platter. I asked Molly Baz, is there anywhere you wouldn\u2019t order fried calamari? She sighed, rubbed the bridge of her nose with her hands, closed her eyes, and told me: \u201cI almost always order it. I\u2019m gonna order it.\u201d Gaby Melian already has plans to have some next week, #calamariplans. Carla Lalli Music recalled an episode of This American Life that exposed some restaurant calamari as pig intestines. \u201cIn that case\u2014no,\u201d she said. Otherwise: yes. \u201cMaybe not at the airport,\u201d said Rachel. \u201cHa!\u201d said Amiel Stanek. \u201cI don\u2019t board a plane without a belly full of squid!\u201d \u201cEven when it\u2019s soggy, it\u2019s good,\u201d said level-headed Hilary Cadigan. \u201cIt might be a little greasy, the marinara might lack acidity,\u201d mused thoughtful Andy, \u201cbut at the end of the day it\u2019s a saucy thing and a fried thing and that\u2019s not gonna be bad.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecultureIs It Ever Okay...
