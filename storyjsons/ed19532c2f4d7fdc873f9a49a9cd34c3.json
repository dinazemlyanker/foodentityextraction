Named after a fishing port town located at the northern part of Denmark\u2019s Jutland peninsula, it was created by famed Swedish restaurateur Tore Wretman in the years after World War II. You\u2019ll find many renditions of this elegant and easy knife-and-fork, open-face toast\u2014luckily, I\u2019ve never met one I haven\u2019t liked. In my version of Skagenr\u00f6ra, the shrimp are bound with mayonnaise and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, then punctuated with fresh dill, lemon (both the zest and juice), and whitefish roe. Traditionally, the shrimp used in the creamy mixture (called Skagenr\u00f6ra) are small, sweet North Atlantic shrimp that are wild-caught and hand-shelled. You can occasionally find such shrimp Stateside in the frozen aisle, but any small shrimp (sometimes called salad shrimp) in the 91\u2013110 count per pound will do. The Skagenr\u00f6ra is chilled in the refrigerator before being heaped upon slices of white bread that have been toasted in a bit of butter.\u2014Hana AsbrinkAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

The onion is awesome!AlanOhio8/28/2021Delicious but I find it very rich with the buttered toast.  I would prefer with a grainy bread and no butter or crackers.  DtroubleOttawa 7/17/2021The onion is traditional, and heaps of horseradish as well. My favourite appetizer!AnonymousSweden7/16/2021Very good! Made it without toast for our midsommar meal. In Los Angeles/Santa Monica, Shoop\u2019s Delicatessen has frozen little shrimps just for this purpose. Looking forward to trying more Asbrink recipes!AnonymousLA7/11/2021Agree that the onion is an abomination.AnonymousMichigan6/22/2021Absolutely fantastic! It's simple to assemble and tastes delicious. I've been raving about this recipe to everyone I know. (also, I used salmon roe since I couldn't find whitefish or bleak fish roe, and it still tasted awesome) EmmaToronto, Ontario, Canada6/15/2021If you don't like or want to use the red onion, try a shower of fresh chopped chives. I tried this when I wanted to make the shrimp toasts but was out of onion, and the fresh chives were a lovely substitute. This is a great recipe!MomcatusaAnderson, SC6/10/2021Love the onion Anonymous6/10/2021I am from Denmark, the onion is an abomination.Mette6/8/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titToastSwedishScandinavianEuropeanShrimpShellfishSeafoodDillHerbs & SpicesLemonCitrusFruitEasyStarterNut-FreeLunchDinnerBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
