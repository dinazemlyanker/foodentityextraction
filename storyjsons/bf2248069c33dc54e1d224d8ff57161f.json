That won\u2019t happen again.By Priya KrishnaApril 4, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPHOTO BY CHELSIE CRAIG, FOOD STYLING BY ALISON ATTENBOROUGHFacebookTwitterEmailPriya Krishna\u2019s cookbook Indian-ish, documenting her journey of learning to make the distinct, hybridized cuisine of her chic, extremely skilled-in-the-kitchen mom, Ritu, will be out from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt later this month.The secret to my mom\u2019s saag paneer is\u2026that it contains no actual paneer.Paneer is great. I love those bouncy, crumbly cubes! I once purchased a birthday card for a friend that said \u201cPa-neer or far, you\u2019re always in my heart.\u201d But trust me: You haven\u2019t lived until you have made saag paneer\u2014a classic Indian dish of of firm, curdled, and unmeltable cheese simmered in a gravy made of greens (often spinach)\u2014with feta.When my mom immigrated to the U.S. in 1980, many of the staple ingredients she had back in India\u2014like roti, ghee, and, of course, paneer\u2014couldn\u2019t be found in New Hampshire grocery stores.When she had the time and patience, she would make paneer from scratch, but she had a demanding job, and within a few years, kids. She eventually settled on tofu as her paneer alternative. It was perfectly fine, albeit without any of that rich milkiness you can taste in paneer. My parents figured that settling for tofu in their saag was just part of adjusting to life in America.Then, in 1998, my family traveled to Greece, and my mom was introduced to the national treasure that is spanakopita: feta and spinach encased in tissue-thin layers of phyllo. She fell hard for the way the salty feta got all up in the crevices of the spinach, balancing out that vegetal earthiness with its bold brininess.When we returned stateside, even though at that point paneer was widely available in Indian grocery stores, she dreamt up a version of saag paneer with large cubes of feta, inspired by the ones we enjoyed on vacation in our Greek salads (which, in Greece, are called\u2026 salads).This turned out to be a more compelling swap than we ever could have imagined. The cubes of feta soaked up the gravy like a sponge. They melted juuust a little in the pan, but still maintained their crumbliness. And the feta naturally salted the dish! Best of all, it required no other adaptations to her existing saag paneer recipe.Here\u2019s how she\u2019d make it: Saut\u00e9 2 tablespoons of whole coriander seeds and two green cardamom pods in a quarter cup of ghee on medium heat until they start to brown. Add a diced onion, let that cook until translucent, and mix in a minced garlic clove, a tablespoon of chopped ginger, and a pound of fresh spinach. Once the spinach has wilted, take the pan off the heat, add a chopped Serrano chile, a quarter tablespoon of lime juice, and a teaspoon of salt, then throw everything in a blender and blitz into a chunky paste. Add that mixture back into your pan on low heat, along with a half cup of water, and fold in 6 ounces of feta cut into cubes. While that warms up, in a small pan or butter warmer, add two more tablespoons of ghee and a teaspoon of cumin seeds on medium-high heat. Once the cumin seeds start to brown, add a pinch of red chile powder, and pour the spice-oil mixture (that\u2019s the chhonk!) over the top of the saag paneer. Serve with rice or roti.Surprisingly, after that initial test run, saag feta made infrequent appearances on our dinner table. My mom usually reserved saag paneer for parties, since it\u2019s slightly more involved to make than other Indian dishes. And when she was preparing it for guests, she always felt like she had to go the traditional route, and use paneer.To be honest, when it came time to write my cookbook (find more recipes from Indian-ish here), I had completely forgotten about saag feta. My mom sent me a text when I was compiling recipes that said, \u201cWhat about that spinach feta dish I make?\u201d Skeptical, I asked her to write down how to make it.I\u2019d forgotten how much I loved the dish until I tried it 70 recipes deep into testing 100 recipes in only three weeks (would not recommend this aggressive timeline, folks). I was overstuffed, reluctantly scooping a spoonful of saag feta on top of some day-old rice. I took a bite, and had a minor meltdown over how wonderful it tasted.It was like when you think you know how something is going to taste, but then it tastes nothing like that. It was better, more aromatic, more intense. My world briefly turned to Technicolor. My mind was blown.Paneer is now so universal in the U.S. that even my local Whole Foods stocks it. I\u2019ll occasionally buy some and use it to make matar paneer, or pan-sear little cubes of it to adorn my salads.But when it comes to saag, I\u2019m sticking to feta.Want this full recipe and more, more, more?
