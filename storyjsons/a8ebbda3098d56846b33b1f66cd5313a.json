Having your own groove is good, because to each their own and all that. But there are some non-negotiables we live by when cooking. From how we toast our nuts and clean our greens, to the absolutely necessary gadgets, here are 14 tried-and-true kitchen rules we couldn\u2019t cook without.1. How we measure flourUse a large spoon to fill cup measure with flour, then use a flat edge (the top edge of a chef\u2019s knife works), flush against the rim, to scrape excess cleanly off the top.Save those parm rinds! You\u2019re making this broth with them.\nTukka Koski2. Three things you should always have in the freezerUnsalted butter: It won\u2019t take on fridge odors, and you'll always need backup.Parmesan rinds: Add to soups, tomato sauces, and pots of beans for rich salty goodness.Raw nuts: Toast and chop for salads, pastas, grain bowls\u2014or deploy for making pesto.Don\u2019t store these in the fridge, folks.\nPhoto by Ted Cavanaugh, Styling by Sue Li3. To chill or not to chill?Refrigerate: Citrus, apples, cornDon\u2019t refrigerate: Tomatoes, garlic, stone fruitIllustration by Monica Ramos4. The three cooking oils you needNeutral: Grapeseed, vegetable, or peanut for high-heat cooking like pan-frying cutlets, frying eggs, and making stir-fries and oil-based cake batters.Olive: Everyday extra-virgin olive olive for saut\u00e9ing veg, making soups, whisking into vinaigrettes, and cooking fish and steaks (spend $15 to $20 for 750 ml).Finishing: Fancy, robust, nuanced olive oil (buy in smaller bottles) for drizzling and never heating.Illustration by Monica Ramos5. Vinaigrette ratio reduxMost of us grew up eating salads dressed with Julia Child\u2019s classic French vinaigrette, which feels a bit heavy and oily on the tongue these days. Our current go-to has a lot more puckery acidity.Then: 3 parts oil, 1 part vinegarNow: 2 parts oil, 1 part vinegar(Hint: Combine and shake in a near-empty mustard jar to emulsify.)Photo by Michael Graydon and Nikole Herriott6. How to revive stale breadFor crusty boules, sturdy sourdoughs, and other artisanal loaves, run the day- or two-day-old bread under running water for a few seconds, then reheat in 350\u00b0 oven until heated through and crisp on the outside.7. Five other uses for chopsticksTester: Check doneness of a big braising cut (such as pork shoulder or leg of lamb) by pushing chopstick into it in several places, wiggling it around, and assessing if the meat is yielding all the way to the bone.Peeler: Use wide end to scrape the peel off a piece of ginger; the rounded edges allow you to get into the little corners and dimples.Turner: Turn things over while they\u2019re deep-frying, like doughnuts.Grabber: Pluck tea bags out of a pot of tea.Flipper: Flip smashed baby potatoes or eggplant slices onto their second side when crisping in oil.Photo by Ted Cavanaugh8. How to boil a (large) eggHard-boiled: Lower into gently boiling water and cook 10 minutes. Transfer to an ice bath and let cool. This is how you make perfect hard-boiled eggs!Jammy: Lower into gently boiling water and cook 6\u00bd minutes. Transfer to an ice bath and let cool. Read about our jammy egg math here.Poached: Crack and slip into simmering water. Cook, occasionally stirring gently, 3 minutes. It looks harder than it is\u2014we\u2019ve got you though.Illustration by Monica Ramos9. It\u2019s ripe when...Artichoke: fresh at cut end; heavy for size; tight leavesAvocado: firm with just a hint of yielding when pressedEggplant: shiny, taut skin; no visible bruises or blemishesMelons: should be fragrant; a bit of give when pressed at stemPineapple: yellow, fragrant; leaf can be plucked out easilyTED CAVANAUGH10. How to clean greensTear or cut leaves from ribs, submerge in a deep bowl of very cold water, and swish to release sandy bits. Lift out (lift\u2014don\u2019t dump!) and place in a colander. Rub leaves between fingers and feel for grit; repeat with fresh cold water if necessary. Spin-dry and transfer to a ziptop bag. Press out air, seal bag, and store in the crisper drawer.Illustration by Monica Ramos11. How to check a steak for donenessWhy take any chances? Get a digital thermometer. Insert probe horizontally from an outside edge rather than straight down from the shallow surface.Very rare: 115\u00b0Rare: 120\u00b0Medium-rare: 130\u00b0Dry and chewy: 145\u00b0Photo by Ted Cavanaugh12.
