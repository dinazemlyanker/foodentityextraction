(Is that how it goes?)By Alex BeggsOctober 9, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Susie TheodorouFacebookTwitterEmail\u201cIt\u2019s funky,\u201d Andy Baraghani said as we cracked open a Ball jar of garlic-chile vinegar, which was around two months old at this point. \u201cBut also addictive and delicious.\u201d We tasted spoonfuls and coughed the good cough. The Thai chile hits, and then poof! (Andy\u2019s hand mimicked a Genie evaporating into his lamp), it disappears.After recent trips to Vietnam and Thailand\u2014with great flight deals, I might add\u2014Andy knew there was a condiment we needed a recipe for. A universal garlic-chile vinegar like the Vietnamese version, dam toi, that he found on every restaurant table (and the more pickle-like prik nam som in Thailand). Use it to finish fatty cuts of meat, braises, noodle soups, and a thrown-together fried rice dinner with a shot of unapologetic heat, funk, and above all, acid. You can find variations on the ingredients (palm sugar or no sugar here, rice vinegar there), and Andy\u2019s recipe adds some ginger for more heat, of a different style than the straight fire of a Thai chile. \u201cIt\u2019s in the background\u2014it rounds everything out.\u201dImmediately drooling.

The recipe calls for Thai chiles, but I made mine with a few habaneros, which bring a tropical and fruity note. After it cools, it can be refrigerated for, let\u2019s say one to two months, at user\u2019s discretion.A view from the top.\nPhoto by Alex Lau\u201cAmericans don\u2019t usually use condiments that are this assertive,\u201d Chris Morocco chimed in, watching me and Andy go in for second spoonfuls to really wake ourselves up. \u201cBut it completely transforms the flavor of a dish, it brightens everything\u2014it\u2019s a secret weapon.\u201d He pointed out the recipe for Angela Dimayuga\u2019s succulent roast pork belly with chile vinegar, where you make the condiment right in the vinegar bottle itself, stuffing the chiles inside.Chris\u2019 grilled snapper with a blistered bean salad tossed in chile vinegar.\nPeden + Munk\u201cIt brings a heat that\u2019s IN YOUR FACE, even though it disappears,\u201d Andy said. Other than as a finishing condiment, he uses a few spoonfuls in dressings for crunchy cucumber salads, or mixed into mayo or yogurt for creamy dressings. Chris makes a version with brown sugar to spoon over this grilled snapper recipe.After he uses up the infused vinegar, Andy likes to chop up the peppers and use them in a relish or salsa. Then it\u2019s time to buy another head of garlic, and get the next batch going.Get the recipe:Garlic-Chile VinegarThis spicy-tangy-funky condiment will become your secret weapon.View RecipeRecipes you want to make.
