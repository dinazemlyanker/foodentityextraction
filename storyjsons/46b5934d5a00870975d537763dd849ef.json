Except in today\u2019s world, we\u2019ve elevated the al fresco experience to an art form. What\u2019s the temperature going to be this weekend? Hold please. What to drink? I\u2019ve got Chablis or a ros\u00e9 from the Douro region. How to prep? Let me count the ways! Grab an oversize blanket and your tote. You are about to win at picnicking. With minimal effort and a few crowd-pleasing essentials in your arsenal, you can be everyone\u2019s hero.See What's in SeasonNo matter the time of year, the farmer\u2019s market is your oyster. In the thick of summer, enjoy newly plucked strawberries, cherries, blueberries, and peaches\u2014and snag a pint of crispy snap peas while you\u2019re at it. If you\u2019re stargazing come fall, pick up pears, apples, or a pomegranate for everyone to share. Whether you make a habit of perusing your local vendors every weekend, or need a last-minute drive-by, your local farmer\u2019s market will be overflowing with pints of fruit your friends will thank you for.Say Cheese...But forget the cheese plate. This picnic is about living one\u2019s best, fuss-free, on-the-go life. There is no time for lugging large cutting boards through a park! Instead, opt for the new Stacy\u2019s\u00ae Cheese Petites. You know Stacy\u2019s\u00ae, the most popular baked Pita Chips brand. Now they\u2019ve come out with a new product for Cheese Lovers. They launched two flavors of Cheese Petites: Romano with Garlic Pepper and Parmesan with Rosemary. They\u2019re made with real cheese (they\u2019re not skimping, either\u2014it\u2019s the first ingredient). And for your buddy who just came from the gym? Stacy\u2019s\u00ae Cheese Petites have six grams of protein per serving, so tell \u2018em to eat up. For a limited time, snag 20% off with the promotion code we found at stacyssnacks.com.Embrace the Seltzer BoomWe don\u2019t think you should bring seltzer to a picnic because it\u2019s all the rage right now (even though it is). We think you should bring seltzer because it\u2019s refreshing, delicious, and is a satisfying alternative to regular ole H2O\u2014sipped alone or mixed with a ros\u00e9! Add your own slice of citrus or opt for a lightly flavored version. Either way, you\u2019re elevating your hydration game.Ros\u00e9 Your WayWe believe that ros\u00e9 season is one worth celebrating, and there is no greater occasion to do so than at a picnic. Everyone\u2019s favorite alternative to a light, crisp white wine can be dry and mineral-y or more fruit-forward, though with just a little extra time at the grocery, you can whip up this hyper-refreshing ros\u00e9 sangria. It\u2019s full of easy-to-find ingredients, and that extra effort will win you major points.Make it HomemadeSure, you could take hummus. You could pick up a premade tabouli from the market, a couple of plastic forks, and a napkin the size of a chess piece. Or, with just a little bit of planning, you could whip up a homemade masterpiece, like these go-anywhere cold miso-sesame noodles, the ultimate afternoon refresher (and belly filler). Up the heat index with Fresno chiles, refresh with cool cucumbers, and bring it home with lime, scallions, and a punchy miso mixture. Everyone will love it; you will have won the picnic.Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
