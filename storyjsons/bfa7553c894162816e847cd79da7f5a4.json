Take a look into her pantry, read celebrity and chef odes to their favorite Ina recipes, watch her and food director Carla Lalli Music make chocolate-pecan scones, and read more from her guest-editing week here.\u00a0\n\u00a0Halloween just came and went, which means Thanksgiving is already around the corner. Time to start thinking about which turkey recipe you\u2019ll try, the sides you\u2019ll make, and whether you\u2019ll opt for classic pumpkin pie or switch up the dessert with something more unconventional. Does thinking about all of that at the beginning of November stress you out? Maybe you should have prepared like Ina Garten and started planning in July.When we were hanging Garten earlier this summer, she was already well underway with her Thanksgiving menu plan. \u201cI\u2019m never stressed!\u201d Hard pause. \u201cNo, of course I am,\u201d she joked. \u201cBut a plan makes me much less stressed than I would be.\u201dFor those of us just getting around to thinking about it now, there\u2019s still something to learn from Garten\u2019s process. Here, the Barefoot Contessa culled her decades-worth of hosting experience for eight pro tips for a (nearly) stress-free Thanksgiving.1. Plan aheadEven if Thanksgiving in July is not for you, you can still get a head start by filling your table with make-ahead dishes. \u201cI try and gear the menu toward things that you can do mostly in advance, like blanching the green beans and saut\u00e9ing them just to reheat, and getting gratins and bread puddings ready to go so they can just go into the oven the day of.\u201d One of the menu additions she\u2019s most excited for this year is the butternut squash gratin from her new cookbook, Cook Like a Pro, which can be prepped days in advance.Butternut squash gratin, from Garten\u2019s latest book Cook Like a Pro, can be made ahead easily\u2014just save the breadcrumbs for the end so they get perfectly crispy.\nQuentin Bacon2. Tackle your shopping in stagesA week before Thanksgiving, she suggests stocking all the staples: baking ingredients, onions, potatoes, and other items that will be able to hold up until the big day. Then, two or three days before the event, she says to shop for fresh ingredients\u2014like green beans, other fragile vegetables, and bread\u2014and make sure her turkey is in the fridge and ready for dry brining.3. No carving for the crowdFor Ina, there\u2019s only one way to cook turkey, and that\u2019s by making it ahead. With her method, you make the gravy ahead too, pour it on a platter, and arrange slices of cooked turkey on top of the gravy about 30 minutes before dinner. \u201cThen you can just put the whole platter in the oven so you're not all dressed up for Thanksgiving and slicing a turkey while everybody\u2019s watching you. I don\u2019t want to do that, and I\u2019m a professional cook!\u201d She adds that the gravy keeps everything moister and hotter longer, so it\u2019s \u201cnot cold by the time the last person eats.\u201d4. Don\u2019t fuss with appetizersForget elaborate hors d'oeuvre\u2014they\u2019re just a distraction. Garten suggests putting out little things, like marcona almonds, instead. \u201cThe most I\u2019ll ever do are figs wrapped in prosciutto or a dip that I can do in advance,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d rather spend my time making the meal and the desserts.\u201d5. Introduce some innovation to the table\u201cI like to do something classic and something new,\u201d she says. One year, that meant swapping in chipotle smashed sweet potatoes that she had been developing. This year, she\u2019s thinking about debuting her triple chocolate loaf cake with a scoop of pumpkin ice cream for an autumnal twist.6. Don\u2019t expect any help!One of Garten\u2019s worst Thanksgiving memories is the time she invited a bunch of friends to make all the dishes together at her home. \u201cThe next thing I knew, they were all in the library watching football, and I was in the kitchen making the entire Thanksgiving meal\u2014right before dinner!\u201d she recalled. \u201cNever did it again. That was that.\u201d Even if she\u2019s still making the whole meal herself, she\u2019d rather have the time to do it peacefully, quietly, and on her own time. If you have reliable family and friends, you can divide and conquer day of; or you can always assign out dishes for a potluck style feast.7. Maybe just make Thanksgiving leftovers sandwiches...for ThanksgivingOnce in a while, Garten and her husband, Jeffrey, will skip hosting Thanksgiving entirely, and jump right to the good part. \u201cOne year we decided we liked leftovers so much that I made the turkey and stuffing the day before, and we had turkey sandwiches for Thanksgiving. It was really fun.\u201d Her ideal sandwich includes turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce on toasted, buttered country bread. Now that\u2019s the ultimate stress-free Thanksgiving game plan.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIna GartenThanksgivingTurkeyCooking TipsCelebritiesRead MorecookingIna Garten Makes Baked Alaska Cool AgainBy Alyse WhitneycultureJennifer Garner Has Been Making Ina Garten\u2019s Beef Bourguignon Since Her Spy DaysBy Jennifer GarnercultureNeil Patrick Harris and David Burtka Built Their Relationship on Ina Garten\u2019s GuacamoleBy Neil Patrick Harris and David BurtkacultureChef Angie Mar Learned Everything About Shrimp Scampi from Ina GartenBy Angie MarRecipes you want to make.
