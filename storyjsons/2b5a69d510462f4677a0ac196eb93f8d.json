Just made it today and it's the perfect balance of salty and sweet and savory. I wanted something that was really nutty and not too sweet so I only added a half cup of sugar and upped the almond butter a bit and it turned out great! Have been snacking on it ever since.Anonymous12/8/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titBreadAlmondNutFigFruitRye FlourFlourButtermilkOther IngredientsSnackHealthyishBakingBreakfastRecipes you want to make.
