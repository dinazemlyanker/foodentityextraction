But, like drinking an Aperol spritz, cooking it is best done outside. Our grilled version won\u2019t smoke out your kitchen, blanket your stove with grease, or ask you to spend even one more minute of this sweet summer night indoors. We found that a three-ounce patty hits the sweet spot: big enough to fill out the bun when smashed but small enough that two patties aren\u2019t overkill.Ingredients4 servings1cup finely chopped dill pickles\u00bdcup mayonnaise2Tbsp. ketchup2Tbsp. sauce from a can of chipotles in adobo\u00bdtsp. kosher salt, plus more1\u00bdlb. ground beef (20% percent fat)4potato rolls\u00bdhead of iceberg lettuce, leaves separated, torn into pieces about the size of the buns1white onion, very thinly sliced into rings on a mandoline4thin tomato slices (optional)2Tbsp. vegetable oil8slices American cheesePreparationStep 1Prepare a grill for high heat. Place a cast-iron griddle, flat side up, on grate; heat until very hot, at least 20 minutes.Step 2Mix together pickles, mayonnaise, ketchup, adobo sauce, and \u00bd tsp. salt in a medium bowl; set special sauce aside.Step 3Divide beef into eight 3-oz. portions (don\u2019t form into patties). Place 4 portions between 2 sheets of parchment paper, spacing 6\" apart, and, using a meat mallet or skillet, firmly smash to create thin patties, about 5\" across. Transfer to a baking sheet. Repeat with remaining portions and fresh parchment paper.Step 4Wrap all the buns together in a large sheet of foil to make a packet (this will keep buns soft and from getting too toasted on the grill). Place packet on grate and grill, turning once, until buns are warmed through, about 1 minute. Spread sauce over cut sides of buns. Place 3\u20134 pieces of lettuce on bottom buns and top each with some onion and a tomato slice, if using.Step 5Drizzle oil over griddle and use paper towels to evenly coat surface. The oil needs to be hot; you should see smoke almost instantly. Season patties lightly with salt. Place 4 on griddle, seasoned side down, and season top sides lightly with salt. Cook, undisturbed, until outer edges are brown and undersides are very crisp, about 2 minutes. Flip and place a slice of cheese on top of each patty. Cook until cheese is melted, about 30 seconds. Transfer patties to buns with toppings, stacking 2 patties on each bun. Repeat with remaining 4 patties, scraping off any cheese stuck to griddle in between batches.How would you rate Smash Burger Alfresco?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (9)Back to TopTriangleThese are great! I found the double meat + double cheese situation to be a bit too much with the small and soft potato bun (not sure if I bought the wrong size or style, it seems strange to me that the pic shows a sesame-seeded bun but the recipe calls for a potato bun), so I ate the second batch as one patty per burger. I don't have a grill, so I just did it on the stove - works totally fine, it's just very smoky so be warned! AnonymousNew York9/8/2020These are FANTASTIC. Taste just like restaurant style smash burgers and are so easy to make. Just made them twice in three days. KathEatsPhiladelphia 4/27/2020This was the best burger we've ever made period so I'll be smashing all my burgers from now on. And whoever on here talking about calories please leave that at the door and love yourself my god. If this pandemic has taught us anything it's that life is SHORT. Eat the damn burger and shut up.AnonymousIowa4/27/2020This is amazing!  Changed the way we make burgers forever.  Only thing possibly more exciting is the adaptation in the article in which Adam Rapoport explains George Motz\u2019s smash burger...AnonymousAustin Tx9/7/2019Bjoycollier, got nutritional info from epicurious.com site where this recipe was also posted.  But when I went back to that site to copy the link, I'm embarrassed to say I noticed it was for FOUR servings, not one.  That reduces calorie count to 803, which is still quite high but more in line with this type of hamburger.  So if 45g of fat doesn't concern you, go for it!AnonymousCambridge MA9/1/2019Anonymous, you should double check your calculations. When I looked up all the ingredients it came out closer to 950 calories (and that\u2019s assuming all that oil stays on the burgers, which it won\u2019t). Easy enough to sub out some of the cheese or one patty instead of two. OR just live life in moderation and eat the smash burger because man cannot live on salad alone. bjoycollierPhoenix 8/31/2019Hate people who write reviews w/o trying recipe, but after checking nutritional info, feel morally obligated to tell readers up front (shouldn\u2019t Bon Appetit?) that consuming this delicious-sounding concoction may result in cardiac arrest, seriously ... each burger = Calories 3213, Carbs 223g (74% RDA), Fat 179g (275%), Sat Fat 58g (288%), Sodium 3146mg (131%), Cholesterol 481mg (160%). Should have warning:  Could be hazardous to your health!
