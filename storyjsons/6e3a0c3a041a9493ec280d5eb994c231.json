Thank me later.By Carla Lalli MusicOctober 24, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailMarcus NilssonFacebookTwitterEmailEvery Wednesday night, Bon App\u00e9tit food director Carla Lalli Music takes over our newsletter with a sleeper-hit recipe from the Test Kitchen vault. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Last week in the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen, my dear colleague Molly Baz sure was tooting her own horn. Which, let\u2019s be honest, she is wont to do, but she was particularly animated on this mid-week morning, and she wanted the world to know about it. Her bragging rights? Well, she\u2019d scored quite a dinner victory the night before by roasting not one, but two chickens. She hadn\u2019t hosted a party, it was just dinner for her and the Mister, and Molly needed us all to know why double-roasting is The Way.\u201cIf you\u2019re not roasting two birds, you\u2019re missing out on one of life\u2019s easiest and most delicious meal prep opportunities,\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cHas anyone ever been mad about leftover roast chicken?!\u201dI wasn\u2019t about to disagree with her\u2014I had certainly never been mad at leftover roast chicken. And while I didn\u2019t want to upstage her, I needed her to know that I have been a double-roast-chicken practitioner for years. This is called camaraderie.\u201cYes!\u201d I yelled (it seemed the most logical response). \u201cFirst of all, one chicken is barely enough for four people, especially when one of them plays JV soccer,\u201d I said. I live with my husband and two sons, so I should know.\u201cOne chicken is barely enough for two people,\u201d Molly declared. She lives with her husband and her dog, Tuna, who may or may not be getting chicken scraps.\u201cOne chicken feeds three people, basically,\u201d I concluded.\u201cYes!\u201d she yelled. It\u2019s great working in a place where people support each other, I thought.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Winner winner, here\u2019s Molly\u2019s double chicken dinner.\n\u201cYou\u2019re literally going through the same amount of work to roast two chickens,\u201d Molly went on, now thinking strategically. \u201cIt takes the same amount of time, they fit on the same rimmed baking sheet\u2014just buy two and double your dinner payoff!\u201d She was yelling again.\u201cIt\u2019s the only way,\u201d I added. \u201cPeople who aren\u2019t doing this are really missing out.\u201d I felt a little sad for those people.Sunday rolled around. It was rainy and grey, the kind of day when you want to just park something in the oven and take a nap before dinner. I bought two chickens, then came home and set the oven temperature to 325\u00b0. I placed the chickens on a large rimmed baking sheet and seasoned them with a mixture of salt, crushed fennel seeds, dried oregano, chopped rosemary, smoked paprika, and freshly ground pepper. I had leftover thyme, so I divided the sprigs between both cavities. Then I took stock of our root vegetable situation and added thickly sliced onion rings, Honeynut squash wedges, and a halved head of garlic to the baking sheet. I seasoned the veggies with salt and pepper and drizzled olive oil over everything. Satisfied, I slid the pan into the oven and set a timer for 2\u00bd hours (this is a slight variation on my Faux-tisserie Chicken recipe). I knew from experience that this would yield chickens with a shreddable, pull-apart texture and deeply browned vegetables seasoned with all the schmaltzy drippings. I wondered if this was how Molly did her chickens, or if she went with a high-heat method. Either way, I knew we were winning.The dinner was a hit\u2014my family of four ate an entire chicken plus the drumsticks from chicken No, 2, the remains of which were wrapped and refrigerated. On Monday night, we warmed up the leftovers and I put mayo and hot sauce on the table for seasoning our chicken pieces. I chopped up the rest of the roasted vegetables and tossed them into a big arugula salad.\u201cLeftovers!\u201d I yelled at my family when we sat down for chicken dinner redux. Reader, no one was mad.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCarla Newsletterroast chickenRead MorecookingCrispy Skin Isn't the End Game of Roast ChickenBy Molly BazcookingMy Fridge Is Full of Fat, What About Yours?By Carla Lalli MusicLifestyleThis Recipe Changed the Way I Feel About Restaurant ChickenBy Amanda GabrielecookingA Garlic-Lover\u2019s Chicken Recipe Because Life\u2019s Too Short to Worry About Bad BreathBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
