As their name suggests, these beans are big. And, we'll be honest, it's this bean's substantial size that's made it an undisputed Healthyish favorite\u2014marinated big beans are a major part of the Feel Good Food Plan\u2019s prodigious lunchtime meal prep, and the show-stopping star ingredient of a recent brothy bean stew.

Their size might translate into longer cook times than smaller varieties of dried beans, but you can toss them in a pressure cooker for tender, creamy beans in under an hour. And for more tips on dealing with dried beans, refer to this handy bean primer. Now, start tracking down some big beans!
