When something\u2019s so easy to make that you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.Central Spain, with its brutal winters and vast fertile plains, is home to some spectacular comfort food. There are hearty bean stews studded with wild game, Flintstone-size steaks of black Alive\u00f1a beef, and snappy chorizo sausages that gush hot, heavenly juices. But to me, an American in Madrid with a soft spot for mashed potatoes, no dish satisfies on a cold, blustery day like patatas revolconas.Patatas revolconas hail from four landlocked provinces west of Madrid: Salamanca, \u00c1vila, Toledo, and C\u00e1ceres. They're garlicky, smoky with piment\u00f3n, and heady with bacon fat and olive oil\u2014the signature flavors of central Spain wrapped up in one bite. Unlike the mild butter-and-cream pur\u00e9es that grace many a Thanksgiving table, these spuds are chunky, bold, spicy, and downright dazzling to behold\u2014deep, glowing orange like a goddamn sunset. And as if all that rich, potatoey goodness weren\u2019t enough, the dish is finished with a handful of torreznos (pork rinds) fried so crisp they\u2019re virtually onomatopoeic. Some (okay, me) even double down on the LDL with a runny fried egg.In the six years that I\u2019ve lived in Spain, patatas revolconas have been my padding of choice on many a beer-drenched tapas crawl. I always thought of them as bar food\u2014until last month, when a friend gifted me a pound of piment\u00f3n from his village in Extremadura. From the instant I stuck my nose in the bag, I couldn\u2019t shake the craving: Quiero revolconas. Trouble was, I had no idea how to make them.That\u2019s how I found myself zigzagging up the Sierra de Guadarrama mountain range to a century-old taberna called Restaurante Santa Mar\u00eda, which, by all accounts, makes some of the dreamiest revolconas on earth. \u201cPatatas revolconas are mountain food,\u201d said Pablo Barrera, the fourth-generation owner. \u201cGood pork, good potatoes, good piment\u00f3n\u2014the ingredients aren\u2019t anything out of the ordinary.\u201d (To be fair, Americans won\u2019t be able to find real-deal papada adobada\u2014spiced cured pork jowl and Barrera\u2019s choice meat for the crispy bits\u2014but slab bacon is a fine substitute.) The secret to knockout revolconas, Barrera told me, is how those ingredients are combined. So he got to cooking, and I got to scribbling.To make four liberal servings, peel 2 lb. medium Yukon Gold potatoes and place them in a pot. Add 2 peeled garlic cloves, 3 Tbsp. kosher salt, 1 bay leaf, and enough water to cover by 2\". Bring the water to a boil over high heat, then simmer over medium-low heat for 25 minutes, or until the potatoes are easily pierced with a knife. Turn off the heat and leave the potatoes in the pot (we\u2019ll need the liquid later on).While the potatoes are boiling, place \u00bc cup extra-virgin olive oil in a cold large skillet or wok. Add 1\u00bc lb. slab bacon cut into rectangular, thumb-size batons, and place over medium-low heat. Fry, stirring occasionally, until bacon is translucent and the fat begins to render, about 15 minutes. Increase the heat to medium, continue frying for 10 minutes (the bacon should be slightly golden now), and then to medium-high to cook until the strips are deep brown all over and well-crisped, about 10 minutes longer. With a slotted spoon, transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.Pour off enough fat (into a jar for safekeeping) to leave approximately \u2153 cup in the pan. Set heat to medium-low and add 2 Tbsp. piment\u00f3n. (At Santa Mar\u00eda they go with the mild \u201cdulce\u201d variety, but you can experiment with medium and hot, you know, to feel something.) Stir for 20 seconds, then slowly\u2014very slowly, to avoid spattering\u2014ladle in \u00bd cup potato cooking liquid. Reserve 1\u00bd additional cups of the potato liquid, drain the potatoes and garlic, and return them to the pot set over low heat. Add all of the piment\u00f3n liquid to the potatoes and mash coarsely. The mixture should be slightly looser and less gloppy than American-style mashed potatoes and not as smooth; add additional potato liquid as needed to achieve that texture. Mound the potatoes into individual bowls or onto one large serving dish and stick the bacon pieces all over the top.If you\u2019re feeling extravagant, use that leftover bacon fat to fry an egg, then slide it on top of the potatoes. Dig in while the revolconas are hot, passing bread and pitchers of red wine as they do in the Spanish countryside, reveling in the creamy-crunchy contrast contained in each spoonful.Benjamin Kemper is a freelance food and travel writer based in Madrid, Spain.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimplePotatoMashed PotatoesSpanishRecipes you want to make.
