But Hatch-chile schmears and custom-built wood-fired ovens? They might be here to stay. The bagel has become the latest DIY project among chefs, and they\u2019re giving it a fresh\u2014but not too fresh\u2014look that\u2019s winning over bagel purists across the country. We talked to a handful of folks about what they're doing to keep things innovative and interesting.The Water\u201cWhen I started R&D for these bagels in 2012, I was extremely focused on the water thing. I tried everything: bottled water, spring water, alkaline water, reverse-osmosis water. Spoiler alert: Its impact on the dough isn\u2019t noticeable. So I ended up using L.A. tap. I\u2019m a born and bred Angeleno, so I wanted to create something that reflected my city because I\u2019m proud as hell of it.\u201d \u2014Nick Schreiber of Belle\u2019s Bagels in Los Angeles.The OvenAt Meyvn in Minneapolis all eyes are on Liza (as in Minnelli), a stainless-steel-tiled oven that sparkles like a disco ball. Chef Adam Eaton credits the wood-fired, gas-assisted oven for imparting a slightly smoky flavor and giving the bagels a blistered exterior and chewy interior. Here\u2019s a look at Liza by the numbers.10,000: The weight, in pounds, of the custom-built oven.20: The amount of people hired to bring the oven into the restaurant.1: The number of bus stops moved in order to install Liza.550: The temp, in Fahrenheit, in which the bagels are bake10,000: The volume of bagels are churned out a week.Bagels coming out of the oven at Meyvn.\nPhoto by Ashley SullivanThe Secret Ingredient\u201cInstead of using barley malt for our bagels, we fell in love with Muddy Pond sorghum syrup from Tennessee. It adds a light molasses note and subtle depth to both the dough and bagel-boiling water. There\u2019s also a historical tie to South Appalachia: When sugar was too expensive, people relied on sorghum. For our bagels, we use a syrup from Muddy Pond in Tennessee and they still make it the traditional way: pressing the sorghum juice between horse-powered, rotating stone slabs and then reducing it to syrup.\u201d \u2014Katie Button of Button & Co.

When a friend from New Mexico offered her a batch of hatch chiles, she thought of turning the pungent green pepper into a cream cheese\u2014naturally. Winston spackles it onto cornmeal-crusted bagels, which balances out the fiery flavor.Photo by Chelsie CraigNectarine cream cheeseThe team behind Call Your Mother in D.C. initially started selling bagels at local greenmarkets, and after weeks of ogling their neighbor\u2019s gorgeous nectarines, they finally gave in and made sweet-savory nectarine cream cheese studded with bits of bacon and jalape\u00f1o. It\u2019s now available at their new brick-and-mortar spot.Photo by Chelsie CraigCaviarWhitefish goes luxe at Freedman\u2019s in Los Angeles.
