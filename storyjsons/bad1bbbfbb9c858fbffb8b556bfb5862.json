I'm surprised there were any negative reviews. Not only was the chicken delicious, it took no time or effort to prepare, and it didn't make a mess of my oven! I used drumsticks and followed the recipe for the most part. Based on other reviews I only used 1 tsp salt in the rub. I also reduced the cumin to 1/4 tsp and added 1 tsp sumac. Doing the dry rub a few hours ahead helps to season the chicken. I followed the recipe for the basting and resting steps and the results were amazing. The skin had a beautiful char, the meat was moist and fell off the bone, both the skin and meat had lots of flavor and the caramelized onions were fantastic.Canadian CookCanada5/17/2021Simple and delicious. Read the reviews before cooking and cut the salt down to a teaspoon. With the prepared BBQ sauce you get all the salt required. Added a little hot sauce and extra garlic, will definitely do this again.George WharrySherwood Park, Alberta 1/12/2021Overall, this was quite good and certainly worth the meager prep required.  The only drawback (and one that I later saw in several comments) is that the rub is WAY too salty.  I say this as someone who is hard to over-salt: I would recommend 1 tsp if you are sensitive to it and 2 tsp for anyone else, vs. the 3 tsp suggested in the recipe.  Aside from that, the rub was excellent and mixed nicely with just your standard Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  The chicken came out extremely juicy with a perfectly crisped skin.  KatLouisville1/10/2021Amazing. Made this twice in the space of a month. First for a small family dinner, second for the extended family. For larger portions, we pre-cooked all the chicken to the first stage, then basted in sauce and broiled just before eating so everything was warm and just out of the oven! The suggestion to add pineapples by another comment below was gold - added them in at the broiling stage with some sauce over. \n\nTo make the flavours really sink in, we actually rub the spice mix onto the chicken overnight and then let the chicken dry out on a rack a bit an hour or so before roasting. Amazing recipe, thank you! AnonymousSingapore9/24/2020Awesome easy to also tweak to personal taste added sliced garlic and finely cubed butternut to bedding.  Will sure do this one again! Thanks \ud83d\ude4f Juicy JohnCanada9/17/2020I have no clue who Anonymous is, who posted right beneath this comment one in which they gave it all of one star, but nothing could be further from the truth. This is absolutely wonderful. The onions alone are worth making the dish. And what a gift to people who have no access to a barbecue! Every element of great barbecued chicken is here--the savory sauce, tender chicken, crispy skin and the absolute ease of oven cooking. Bravo Ms. Saffitz! You have done it again. rsmmathewsBridgehampton NY8/16/2020Umm. This is really not good. The rub is really bad - too salty and something is off. Anonymous5/24/2020This is absolutely delicious. I live in Spain and I think salt here is \"stronger\" so this turned out too salty for me. Made it a second time reducing the amount of salt and worked perfectly. Will definitely make this againisalarawBarcelona, Spain4/22/2020Suuuuuuper delicious!!! Really loved it definitely will make againlilylipfordNorth Carolina4/18/2020Didn't taste very bbq-y. It tasted more like Indian flavor. It was okay, but very strong. Just not what i expected with the name.BuggsbunnayPoconos, PA4/7/2020Ridiculously easy (dare I say, foolproof) recipe to follow that yields a TON of flavor at the end. Thanks Claire!AnonymousPhoenix, AZ4/7/2020This was the best oven baked bbq chicken that I have made in a while! I will make this again.Adrake78CT - USA11/5/2019I made it and it turned out awesome. I will definitely be making it again. AnonymousTwin Cities MN5/28/2019This is SO easy and SO delicious! Will make over and over again.AnonymousMemphis5/19/2019Made it TWICE this week!
