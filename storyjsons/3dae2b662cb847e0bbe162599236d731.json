If you\u2019ve ever been confronted by the Whole Foods antipasto bar, full of olives and broken promises, you understand what we mean. With dozens of choices from cheese-filled peppers to pickled okra, assembling a perfect container of things you\u2019ll love and not regret spending $9.42 on is tricky. We\u2019ve been around the olive block many times, and eight Bon App\u00e9tit staffers went to bat for their favorite items on the briny bar. Check out our ultimate lineup below\u2014based solely on what we can find in NYC, but these are all available nation-wide at Whole Foods\u2014so you can go in with a solid game plan.Peppadew Peppers\u201cPeppadew\u2014fun to say and eat! These pickled peppers are barely spicy and add what interior design blogs call a POP of color to your monotonous orange cheese board. Or pep of color? Pep in your step? The dad jokes come from every direction. Pick up some peppadews the next time you\u2019re idling in the antipasto bar dept. See how it goes. You can also chop them up and use them in place of pimientos in pimiento cheese, or artichoke dip, or in this awesome saucy chicken scarpariello recipe. There\u2019s no such thing as a peppa-don\u2019t.\u201d \u2014Alex Beggs, senior web editorCaper Berries\u201cCaper berries are hard to come by, so when you do find them, buy them. I slice them crosswise into little rounds, fry them in olive oil until crispy and then sprinkle over salads, saut\u00e9ed greens, or roasted potatoes. They also make a great alt breadcrumb on pasta. They get crispy AF but are also quite salty, so deploy with restraint.\u201d \u2014Molly Baz, senior associate food editorPhoto by Chelsie CraigCastelvetrano Olives\u201cCastelvetranos are the best olives. They taste like no other olive. The flavor is sublime, mild in a way that feels more like a warm ray of sunshine or the first breath of fresh air after a day in the office. They\u2019re creamy, as if someone injected it with little hits of butter that melt on your tongue. I\u2019ll throw a bunch of them in a bowl for parties, warm some in olive oil and serve them with feta and bread for a more refined appetizer, or just keep a tub in the fridge for when that weeknight Castelvetrano itch comes a knockin\u2019. And in a 5-minute olive sauce over chicken thighs or seared fish? Game over.\u201d \u2014Alex Delany, associate web editorMarinated Gigante Beans\u201cI\u2019ve waxed poetic about my my obsession with gigante beans before, and I\u2019m not planning on stopping anytime soon. The marinated gigantes at the antipasto bar were my gateway bean: an impossibly creamy, slightly tangy legume that made every (admittedly overpriced) salad bar lunch feel special. I\u2019ve since moved on to marinating my own big beans, but if I spot these babies at the antipasto bar, they\u2019re destined for my basket. Spooned onto an antipasto platter, mixed into a salad, or eaten straight-up as a high-protein snack, gigante beans are perfect.\u201d \u2014Aliza Abarbanel, editorial assistant, HealthyishPhoto by Chelsie CraigCornichons\u201cNot to brag, but if there were some sort of mayor or ambassador of the Whole Foods antipasto bar it would be me. And, look, you\u2019re not going to the antipasto bar to just get one thing\u2014ask me about my Layering Technique\u2014but if I had to nominate a single item it would be cornichons. They are tiny and cute. Sour and crunchy. And the exact snack I am looking for while I throw together dinner.\u201d \u2014Rachel Karten, social media managerDolce K Mt. Athos Olive Mix\u201cAn unexpectedly sweet item in the salty sea of the antipasto bar, I first tried this item on accident. I scooped a pile onto a warm piece of seeded bread, thinking the white hunk was garlic and the small, dark thing was a caper. But no\u2014the mix, marinating in oil, is full of blanched marcona almonds, raisins, golden raisins, currants, little hunks of citrus rind, a hint of spice, and mixed olives. I enjoy the combo with a hearty bread and soft cheese (ciabatta and goat cheese, a crusty baguette and Gournay cheese). I even like it on top of a salad, where it serves as a makeshift dressing.\u201d \u2014Zoe Sessums, e-commerce editorial assistantPhoto by Chelsie CraigGrilled Artichokes\u201cGrilled artichokes are amazing because I would never spend the time to cut up, grill, and marinate artichokes on my own\u2014who do you think I am? They\u2019re meaty, which makes them a pretty perfect addition to a lazy meal. I love to put them on top of pasta with Parm and breadcrumbs, or if I\u2019m feeling really lazy, I\u2019ll fry bread and spread on some ricotta, honey, and artichokes for the ultimate couch dinner.\u201d \u2014Emily Schultz, associate social media managerMarinated Mixed Mushrooms\u201cRaw mushrooms somehow always end up sitting in my crisper drawer for a few days too long and get soggy, but marinated mixed mushrooms get eaten in 24 hours or less. I use the garlicky \u2018shrooms as a sauce for rotisserie chicken after weeknight grocery shopping, and then top scrambled eggs and toast with them the next morning. All of the pieces are small enough to be tender and chewy at the same time, and it gives me a selection\u2014usually oyster, enoki, chanterelle, and shiitake\u2014of wild mushrooms to try all at once instead of buying each individually and maybe forgetting about them in the fridge.\u201d \u2014Alyse Whitney, associate web editorHey, another way to use antipasti...Explore Bon App\u00e9titAntipastoGroceryShoppingRead MoreSweet and Spicy Antipasto SaladAntipasti Hand Saladculture13 Whole Foods Product Deals on Amazon Right NowBy Alyse WhitneyRecipes you want to make.
