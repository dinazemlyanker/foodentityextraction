Today, we're a community that doesn't live solely at a web address or on an Instagram page: You guys are out there cooking, eating, and living healthyish every day. And, well, we really want to hang out with you IRL!So we're doing it. We're calling it Healthyish Superpowered: It's a new kind of dinner party, and it's coming to a city near you in 2018. Over the course of the year, we'll be hosting a series of dinners in honor of early-to-mid-career women who are living and breathing this \"wellness is for everyone\" thing every damn day. Each woman we honor will choose a local charity to receive a portion of all ticket proceeds. These dinners are our way of bringing healthyish-minded people together to meet, eat, and party at some of our all-time favorite restaurants (that just happen to be run by women). All for a very good cause.Superpowered kicks off on March 27 in San Francisco, with a family-style dinner by Gabriela C\u00e1mara at her restaurant Cala, in honor of Aileen Suzara, a cook and educator who's working with communities of color to promote vibrant, healing food cultures. Fifty percent of ticket sales go to La Cocina, the food incubator that helped Suzara jumpstart her mission-based catering business, Sariwa. And if you can't make it to the dinner, you can still eat the food: Cala is launching an exclusive healthyish dish on Caviar (our very awesome partner!) for a limited time in March. Plus, there's now a whole section of Healthyish-approved restaurants on the meal delivery app, all over the country.We'd love to see you on March 27 if you're in the SF area. And, if not, check out our whole itinerary to see when we're heading your way. We're so excited to hang out with you!Buy tickets to Healthyish Superpowered and see the whole schedule here.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSuperpoweredTrendsRead MorecultureAileen Suzara Is Flipping the Script About 'Unhealthy' Filipino FoodBy Melissa Pandika Recipes you want to make.
