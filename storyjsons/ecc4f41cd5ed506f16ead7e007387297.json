Compared to summer nights, when I bike back from campus to a kitchen full of sunlight and fresh vegetables from my farm share, coming home to cook dinner in winter is depressing. Walking through my dark house, flipping all the lights on, staring at the squash and carrots that don\u2019t really have to be cooked tonight\u2026well, it\u2019s enough to make me want to order takeout and eat it in bed.These days I\u2019m looking for light wherever I can get it, so when I saw Dusen Dusen\u2019s Penrose dish towels, I knew I had to have them. In perfectly patterned yellow, green, and red, these three dish towels liven up my kitchen. It may have been dark for hours by the time I pull my baked ziti out of the oven, but the handle of my oven door? Bright and sunshiny with my yellow Dusen Dusen dish towel hanging there!Dusen Dusen Dish Towel Set$50 $35 at Shopbop$50 $43 at GarmentoryThese towels are 100% cotton, soft enough to comfortably dry your hands but heavy-duty enough to scrub out a remnant of turmeric and miso sweet potato soup crusted onto a pot, forgotten by an absent-minded dishwasher. The towels wash easily and dry just as nicely in the air as in the dryer. While the material is superior, it\u2019s really the patterns\u2014vibrant with a funky geometry that keeps my eye surprised\u2014that draw me back to Dusen Dusen\u2019s home goods. The print, named after physicist Roger Penrose, looks like the kind of flowers I doodled in middle school notebooks, loopy and colorful. It\u2019s a little thing that gets me excited to return to my vegetable drawer and Dutch oven when I\u2019d rather be under the covers\u2014a literal bright spot in my dim Cambridge kitchen.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make.
