This recipe from bread master Bryan Ford is based on his Master Dough recipe; simply portion it out, roll into tight balls, then dip in sesame seeds (or any small seeds and seasonings of your choice\u2014poppy, flax, dried onion\u2026). Ford bakes his buns in muffin rings, which gives them dramatic height\u2014but free-form works just as well.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Lightly flour work surface with bread flour and turn Master Dough out onto surface. Using a chef\u2019s knife or bench scraper, divide dough into eight pieces (about 90 g each). Working one at a time, pull edges of portioned dough up and over into center, then turn over, seam side down, onto a less-floured spot (you want the dough to have friction with the surface). Cup your hand around dough and, working your hand in a circular motion, draw dough across surface to create a ball.\u2192 Need help shaping?

Working one at a time, brush egg wash over surface of a dough ball with a pastry brush. Dip coated portion into seeds, rolling around to coat evenly.

(Dough should spring back slowly when gently poked.)Step 4Preheat oven to 450\u00b0 and bake rolls until golden brown, 20\u201325 minutes.Step 5Do ahead: Rolls can be baked 3 days ahead.

Take care to put these low in the oven - in the top 1/3rd of my oven, the eggwash burned and started smoking within a couple minutes. Once I moved them down, the rest of the surface area cooked to a beautiful golden brown in just 12 min!  Crusty on the outside, dense but soft on the inside. I'll cook shorter and lower next time, otherwise, these are great.
