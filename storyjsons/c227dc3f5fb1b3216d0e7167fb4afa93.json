Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,Are you sick of gift guides yet? On the one hand, it\u2019s all too much. On the other hand, I\u2019m still missing a couple key people on my list (Mom, you\u2019re impossible), and this year\u2019s extra-short window between Thanksgiving and Christmas has me scrambling for that perfect present.If you feel similarly, the Healthyish gift guide is a great place to start. I have special spots in my heart for the ceramic cheese plates and the Marylou Faure print. But if you\u2019re not finding what you\u2019re looking for there or on any of BA\u2019s other guides, here are some things I\u2019m giving\u2014and coveting\u2014this year.Give the gift of good bread. I love Chabaso, based in New Haven, CT, because they\u2019re working to build a local grain economy by using grains grown in the Northeast. Try the Farm to Loaf bundle, which includes the dense and seedy Danish rye loaf that\u2019s been my breakfast most mornings this week.Consider this one-of-a-kind bracelet from Fewer/Finer\u2014or any of founder Madison Snider\u2019s gorgeous designs, handmade in NYC. Yes, they\u2019re a splurge, but these pieces are high-quality and simple enough to be worn literally all day, every day.For your friend who can\u2019t stop having dinner parties since they bought Nothing Fancy, get this table runner and matching linen napkins from Sunday/Monday. These and all of Nisha Mirani\u2019s textiles are produced by artisan families in India, and the designs pay homage to traditional Indian motifs, which other textile companies often appropriate without credit.I\u2019ve been \u201cgetting really into coffee,\u201d which is a statement I never thought I\u2019d make. One of my favorite coffee-related discoveries has been Yes Plz\u2019s bean-and-zine subscription: you guessed it, a regular delivery of coffee beans plus an issue of the totally charming and idiosyncratic zine. I love that there are multiple subscription options ranging from weekly to monthly, and the price ($17 each) is always the same.And on the subject of coffee, now that I\u2019m thinking about things like brew time and ratios of water to grinds (kill me), I need a scale that doesn\u2019t automatically shut off when I\u2019m in the middle of making a pour over. The best (and prettiest) high-end option I\u2019ve found is the Acacia, but I also use this Oxo guy when I\u2019m in the Test Kitchen, and it never goes dark on me.The best gifts aren't just homemade\u2014they're snacks.\nPhoto by Emma Fishman, Food Styling by Sue LiScrew winter: Everyone still wants white sneakers, especially these high-tops from long-running Czech brand Bata.Everyone at work teases me for never taking off these headphones, but there\u2019s a reason why, and it\u2019s not because my coworkers are annoying\u2014love you all! It\u2019s because they fill my ears in sonic pleasure, whether it\u2019s the new Kelsey Lu remixes, that one Fleetwood Mac song I can never get out of my head, or sweet, noise-canceled silence.Clue someone in to Paper Phone, a free app that puts the essential info you need from your phone each day (contacts, map, weather, a recipe) into a printable PDF. A little twee, but a little genius.Tell your favorite good boy about @awardsforgoodboys. Direct him to this post. Or this one. Wait, this one? No...definitely this one.Make a giant batch of healthyish party mix and give it away in cute little jars. I can\u2019t even describe how craveable this stuff is, especially warm out of the oven. The week that Sohla El-Waylly was developing this recipe, I kept gravitating to the test kitchen like a zombie caveman. Me want party mix. Yum.Aaand I\u2019m spent (like, literally, my YNAB budget hates me this month). Good luck to you all, and I\u2019ll see you next week.Until then,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish editorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishGift GuidesHealthyish NewsletteressayRead MoreLifestyleThe Healthyish Gift Guide for People With Impeccable TasteGallery16 SlidesBy The Healthyish TeamRecipes you want to make.
