The dozens of roses, poorly-rhymed cards, and heart-shaped boxes of chocolates are recycled every year. But if you really want to embrace the cheesiness, you need one thing: cheese. Actually, two. Cheese and cheesy romantic comedies. Instead of a drinking game where you take a shot every time someone chases the love of their life in the rain, or two friends realize they\u2019re falling for each other, take a bite of cheese. Whether you\u2019re watching movies solo on your couch, ordering in a few pizzas with best friends, or enjoying a night in away from chaotic restaurants this V-Day, this is the game plan for you. Here are 10 cheesy rom-coms to stream online and the cheeses to devour while watching.1. 13 Going On 30 (Netflix)When we turned 13, we should have wished for cheese. To represent Jennifer Garner\u2019s character Jenna at ages 13 and 30, pair a young gouda with an aged gouda here. You might not even be able to tell they are the same thing\u2014young goudas are springy and melty, whereas their elder counterparts are nutty and complex.2. Dirty Dancing (Amazon Prime)If you eat Harbison\u2014one of our favorite creamy, funky, birch-wrapped cheeses\u2014you\u2019ll have the time of your life. Nobody puts this cheese in the corner, because as soon as people try it they are obsessed.3. Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary (Netflix)If you're alllll byyyy yooourseeeeelf on Valentine\u2019s Day, Montgomery\u2019s Cheddar will keep you company. It is the definition of a classic English Cheddar. A Colin Firth of Cheddars, if you will. Charming, a bit quiet, and irresistible.4. She\u2019s All That (Hulu)Epoisses, a custardy French washed-rind cheese, is known for being stinky. At first you may not be so into the smell, but once you try the robust, almost-meaty, impossibly-creamy cheese, you won\u2019t be able to stop thinking about it. The first bite is like when nerdy Laney (Rachael Leigh Cook) walks down the stairs post-makeover and Zach (Freddie Prinze Jr.) realizes what he\u2019s been missing out on.5. How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days (Netflix)We\u2019d sing \u201cYou're So Vain\u201d to a blue-veined cheese like Cambozola on Valentine\u2019s Day. It\u2019s kind of like Matthew McConaughey\u2014a crowd-pleasing guy with a little bit of something you can\u2019t quite put your finger on. Alright? This is the type of cheese you could fall in love with in fewer than 10 days, easy.6. Sweet Home Alabama (Hulu)Green Hill from Sweet Grass Dairy is a great example of excellent cheesemaking in the American South. If they made this Camembert-esque double cream cheese in the fictional Alabama town that NYC fashion designer Melanie (Reese Witherspoon) grew up in, even she\u2019d be impressed.7. Me Before You (Amazon Prime)You\u2019ll probably cry a lot when watching this movie adaptation of Jojo Moyes\u2019 heartbreaking book about a quirky caretaker (Game of Thrones\u2019 Emilia Clarke) who falls in love with her snarky patient (Sam Claflin). So eat your feelings with La Tur, a decadent, almost molten cheese that takes care of you and makes any bad day go away. It\u2019s like a personal pan pizza\u2014but a single-serving wheel of cheese instead.8. Ella Enchanted (Netflix)Let Purple Haze chevre cast a spell on you. It\u2019s an elegant goat cheese thanks to lavender and fennel pollen, and if you were under a spell like Ella Enchanted (Anne Hathaway in this fairytale adaptation), you wouldn\u2019t mind being commanded to eat lots and lots of it.9. 50 First Dates (Hulu)If we had to eat one cheese over and over again because we \u201cforgot\u201d about it like Lucy (Drew Barrymore) forgets about Henry (Adam Sandler), it\u2019d be garlic and herbs Boursin. No, we could never forget about it! Ever.10. Definitely, Maybe (Netflix)This 1992-set movie feels very nostalgic. We could imagine Will (Ryan Reynolds) dipping into some fondue with any one of his exes that he tells stories about to his daughter (Abigail Breslin). He\u2019d probably be into this cheese fondue with beer rather than the classic Swiss version, though. Since this movie is thrice as cheesy as the rest\u2014three romantic stories in one!\u2014it makes sense to give it meltiest cheese. By the end of the movie, your heart will Definitely, Maybe have melted, too.No, you\u2018re a cheese ball:Explore Bon App\u00e9titMoviesPop CultureValentines DayCheeseRead MorecultureHow to Pair Cheese with Cheese Crackers for Double the CheeseBy Tia KeenantechniquesHow to Pair Cheese with Potato Chips, Please Take This SeriouslyBy Tia KeenanPhotography by Noah FeckscultureHow to Serve a Killer Cheese Plate with Only ONE CheeseBy Alyse WhitneyValentine\u2019s Day RecipesRecipes you want to make.
