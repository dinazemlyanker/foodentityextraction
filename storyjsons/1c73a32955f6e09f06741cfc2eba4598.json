And it smells like what we imagine that alpine meadow from The Sound of Music smells like. It won\u2019t get you stoned per se, but it does contain THC (specifically the sativa-hybrid, euphoria-inducing Jack Herer strain) and when spritzed onto pulse points and sniffed, we noticed a mild dreamy-happy feeling that exceeded the usual \u201chey that smells good\u201d pleasantness. Also the packaging is extremely pretty.Drew Martin X Heretic The Herbalist PerfumeShop NowFor the person who bought a tiny tree on Etsy for their one-bedroom apartment:Insa\u2019s Peppermint Candy Cane Dark Chocolate Bar is peppermint bark but with weed in it.
