For every baking project, every dinner party, even every one-pot meal made for you and you alone, there are also splatters and spills and stray ingredients in strange corners of your stove. Sure, it would be nice if the rule of \u201cwhoever doesn\u2019t cook is on dish duty\u201d solved everything, but simply washing pots and pans never really cuts it.Take, for example, BA\u2019s Best Baked Ziti, a dish that is worth every bite but is also cause for some disorder. Here are some tips to help tackle the post-cooking mess.Wash dirty linens immediatelyYes, you should wear an apron, but aprons still need to be cleaned. Regardless of whether or not you covered up your crisp white shirt, regardless of whether or not you managed to escape the flying red juices of canned tomatoes, some splatter is unavoidable. The solution is to put those linens into the wash as soon as possible. The longer you wait, the harder it will be to get the stains out.Clean as you goEvery pro knows that the key to an efficient work station is to clean as you go. There\u2019s nothing worse than a full sink that needs to be addressed after dinner is done and you\u2019re a glass of wine or two deep. Soak that pot that had tomato sauce in it while the pasta water boils, wash that cheese grater while you blend the sauce, and rinse those bowls as soon as you\u2019re done using them.Pour off excess grease into a jarGrease is the enemy of cleaning. It just\u2026 never seems to come off of any surface. But if you pour the excess into a jar before you move on to scrubbing, you\u2019ll have an easier time. Plus, this saves your sink from clogging because grease is not good for your pipes; it will get stuck down there and eventually cause plumbing trouble.Soap, water, and elbow greaseYou generally don\u2019t need fancy sprays or wipes for surfaces. Soap and water on a sponge\u2014with the help of your strong arms on tougher parts\u2014should work perfectly fine.Use water and a brush for cast-ironA cast-iron skillet can be a bit of a beast, and it needs to be taken care of. For this, just use water to rinse and a brush to get off any residual food. Then set the wet skillet over a low flame to make sure it fully dries.Get into the nooks and crannies of your stoveFor a gas range stove, use a brush to clean the top grates. Then lift them up and off and use a sudsy cloth to wipe the part underneath. For an induction stove where the whole surface is smooth, you\u2019re good to go with just the sudsy cloth.Use a sheet tray as a catch-allThe oven is an often-overlooked part of kitchen cleaning. The food that falls down to the bottom tends to be forgotten about. One way to avoid that is to place a sheet tray on the rack underneath whatever you\u2019re baking. In the case of baked ziti, it will catch anything that boils over.Save water by using a dry brush to clean dishesWhen loading up the dishwasher, it\u2019s important to get the caked-on food off beforehand, otherwise your dishes won\u2019t get properly clean. But it wastes a lot of water to rinse them and then run the machine. So instead, try wiping off the leftover bits and pieces with a dry brush. It works perfectly well and is better for the environment. That\u2019s what we call a win, win.Get the recipe: BA\u2019s Best Baked ZitiExplore Bon App\u00e9titCleaningSamsungRead MorecultureThe BA Test Kitchen Wants to Help You Clean Up Your MessBy Elaheh NozariRecipes you want to make.
