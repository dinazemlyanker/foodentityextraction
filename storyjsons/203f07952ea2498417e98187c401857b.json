But swap the yeasty pizza dough with buttery pie dough, use a hard and salty cheese instead of milky mozz, slices of peak-season tomatoes instead of sauce, and you\u2019ll have something just as mouthwatering and beautifully caloric. This tomato galette. Recipe by Andy Baraghani.I made it for lunch on a 90 degree summer afternoon recently\u2014a personal pan galette!\u2014and I can\u2019t wait to make it again and again for actual humans the rest of the summer. My plan is to slice it into dainty wedges to serve with lakeside martinis (can you imagine?!). These layers don\u2019t lie: flaky pie crust, shredded cheddar or gouda, sliced and drained tomatoes (more on that in a sec), thin coins of fresh garlic, a shower of chives, and a sprinkle of lemon zest. It\u2019s from our simple issue, so the rules must apply. And it was simple, I swear.It can come together fast if you follow these tips:Make pie dough ahead, even if it\u2019s just one day. And freeze it. I make double batches of pie crust so that Future Me can make impulse pies/galettes. (You can imagine what else Future Me has in store\u2014so much backup Charmin Ultra Strong.)Salt ya tomatoes. Slice and salt your tomatoes so you can drain the liquid off them before building the galette. Those few tablespoons of tomato goo will otherwise soak into the dough and cause the dreaded soggy-bottom boy.Use scissors to cut the chives right on top of the finished galette. Why was I ever cutting chives with a knife before?But don\u2019t rush beauty. It has to bake for an hour. And, huh, wow, that\u2019s just enough time to mix up another batch of Future Dough...Get the recipe:Tomato GaletteA savory galette topped with peak season tomatoes, cheese, and garlic.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titTomatoGaletteRecipes you want to make.
