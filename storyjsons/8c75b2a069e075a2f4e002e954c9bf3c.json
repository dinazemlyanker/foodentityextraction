But a restaurant\u2019s branding? I judge that based on whether or not I buy a tote bag. And let it be known: I walked out of Portland, Maine\u2019s Rose Foods carrying a tote adorned with a fish drinking a cup of coffee.But it wasn\u2019t just the tote that caught my eye at Rose Foods (one of our Top 50 nominees!). It was everything. The golden, hand-painted type on the mirrors, advertising \u201cNova Lox\u201d and \u201cPastrami on Rye.\u201d The illustration of a weird bagel man on the printed menus. The logo\u2019s subtle nod to the retro Jewish deli, through its angular font. The baby blue type, reaching across the backs of the employees t-shirts, reading, \u201cWhat a time to be alive.\u201d I was immediately smiling, muttering, \u201cThis is so rad,\u201d to myself and anyone else in earshot.The covetable tote from Rose Foods\nEmma FishmanI have the folks at Office of Brothers, a design agency based in Atlanta, to thank. Founded by Alvin Diec and Travis Ekmark, Office of Brothers works to brand restaurants from the likes of Asheville\u2019s Buxton Hall Barbecue to Atlanta\u2019s Golden Eagle to the aforementioned Rose Foods. The design group creates restaurant identities with quirky illustrations, scripted typefaces, and a casual elegance that, yes, look cool\u2014but also turns the branding of a restaurant or bar into a human element, one that speaks just as loudly as the fare.One might say that Office of Brothers possesses a retro sensibility. But they would not. \u201cFor us, that\u2019s not a word that ever comes into our heads,\u201d says Ekmark. \u201cIn fact, the second we sense the r-word trickling into our brains, we will put our heads under the tires of a bus. We suppose \u2018retro\u2019 equals \u2018trend,\u2019 but we think of ourselves as having a loyalty towards history.\u201dThe menus, t-shirts, matchbooks, and magnets at Rose Foods make that loyalty clear. The design isn\u2019t old. And it isn\u2019t new. It pulls from everything, past and present. \u201cEvery day we discover more and more beautiful things,\u201d says Diec. \u201cIt\u2019s enough to drive one mad.\u201dIt\u2019s that sponge-like ability to absorb inspiration that makes Office of Brothers\u2019 work so relatable. When I stepped into Buxton Hall last year, I was excited to eat the whole hog barbecue. But the array of t-shirts, strategically placed near the front door, made me forget about pulled pork and fried chicken sandwiches long enough to get lost in a world somewhere between reality and a trippy cartoon from the \u201970s. Every illustration and type specimen was not just fun, but so incredibly appropriate. They were pulling not from one source of inspiration, but from every block that makes a barbecue joint what it is. It was perfect design.\u201cThe author of Ecclesiastes wrote, \u2018There is no new thing under the sun,\u2019\u201d says Diec. \u201cWhen you look into the history of food advertising and commercial art, you will find a great spectrum of style, from dry and dull to wacky beyond all reason. What kind of small-minded person would only wish to stay forever within a narrow envelope when the world is rolling at your feet?\u201dAnd it\u2019s that kind of inspired, slightly wacky emotional scope that will make you just as excited to to throw Rose Food\u2019s branded tote over your shoulder as it does to eat their smoked salmon. For the record, there are now four other people in the Bon App\u00e9tit office with that very same tote bag. I was the first one, which means people are officially biting my style. I\u2019d be mad, if I didn\u2019t get so happy every time I saw that fish drinking coffee. How does he hold the cup when he has flippers? Wouldn\u2019t it just fall right down, shattering on the floor? Does he know how silly this situation is? That he\u2019s going to burn his scales?Questions only Office of Brothers could ask.Read more about the 25 restaurant trends we saw in 2018Related: Portland, Maine, Is the 2018 Restaurant City of the YearExplore Bon App\u00e9titThe Hot 10Hot 10 2018Read MorecultureI Buy Souvenirs for My Dining Table and So Should YouBy Erika OwenrestaurantsThe Well-Crafted Kitchen: Inside the Whimsical, Dreamy World of FrenchetteBy Elyse Inamineculture10 Cult Nordic Design Brands That Will Transform Your KitchenBy Julia BlackRecipes you want to make.
