Inside-baseball natural wine merchants R\u00f8dder & Vin (a living room\u2013like wine shop nearby where you\u2019ll see people with tote bags from Brooklyn\u2019s Four Horsemen) provide the bottles, which you order from the butcher-paper menu hung on the wall. It\u2019s never precious or too cool. In fact, it\u2019s just right.ORDER THE: oysters; tartare; and always nibble the bread: They get it from Mirabelle.THE VIBE IS: beachy Scandi, with whitewashed walls and raw wood floors. The service is casual and friendly, thanks to owner Sarah-Emilie.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Tuesday to Thursday from 4 to 11 p.m. and Friday and Saturday from 4 p.m. to midnight. Closed Sunday and Monday.\u2014Christine MuhlkePhoto by Ditte IsagerPhoto by Ditte IsagerPhoto by Ditte IsagerWE ALSO LOVEAncestraleIn Vesterbro, a cool little wine bar (and a relief to your wallet) Den VandretteGet your L\u2019Anglore fix at this sunny Indre By wine barVed Stranden 10Get lost in natural wines at this living room-esque Indre By barExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
