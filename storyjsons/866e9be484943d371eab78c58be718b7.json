And no venting style is more impressive than the lattice crust. For this strawberry-lemon lattice crust pie, author Alison Roman explains how to weave your way to success.Christopher TestaniStart with chilled dough from our Flakiest Pie Crust recipe. Working on a piece of parchment paper will make it easier to transport the lattice crust strips later on.Christopher TestaniA ruler will help you get perfectly even strips. We chose a beginner-friendly wide lattice for our Strawberry-Lemon Lattice Pie, but feel free to make your lattice strips as wide or thin as you'd like.Christopher TestaniSave the little rounded ends of dough\u2014they come in handy if you need scraps to patch up one of the lattice strips.Christopher TestaniStart with the longest strips first, and work with one piece at a time rather than trying to arrange them all at once.Christopher TestaniUnder, over\u2014it doesn't matter which order you go in, just don't be scared to get 'er in there.Christopher TestaniKeep going.Christopher TestaniYou want to work fairly quickly, as softer pie dough is much harder to work with. Each lattice strip should make contact with the edge of the crust\u2014no need to get it perfect, as you'll fold all the edges in later.Christopher TestaniA simple fold-over crimp ensures none of those good pie juices will escape during the baking process.Christopher TestaniThose scraps you saved earlier? They'll come in handy if you need a patch-up or two while folding over your crust.Christopher Testaniif you want a cleaner look, you can always trim the edges of the crust before folding it in. But Roman prefers a more rustic, galette-style crust.Christopher TestaniA simple egg wash with a splash of water will get the top of your pie nice and golden.Christopher TestaniA sprinkle of turbinado sugar, granulated sugar, or demerara sugar gives you that crackly, sparkly look and crunchy texture.Christopher TestaniBake pie until crust is deep golden brown on top and bottom and juices are bubbling, about 1\u00bd hours. This time is not a typo: That's how long it takes for the crust to perfectly brown and the fruit to properly thicken. There's an epidemic of underbaked pies in America. It's time to put an end to it!Christopher TestaniMost importantly, wait\u2014at least 4 hours! This may seem like torture, but it's just the truth; the filling needs this time to properly set. If you can wait even longer, we firmly believe that pie is better the day after it's baked.Christopher TestaniGet the Recipe:Strawberry-Lemon Lattice PieBig fat strips of dough make for a rustic and modern-looking pie (and they\u2019re easy to weave into a lattice).\u00a0View Recipe1 / 61ChevronChevronApple-Cheddar PieView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPieSummer DessertsPie CrustRecipes you want to make.
