Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Dear Healthyish readers,I have a cheap Belgian waffle iron that I purchased when I was right out of college and back living at my parents\u2019 house in New Jersey. When I moved out, the waffle iron stayed behind\u2014I couldn\u2019t justify space for it in my shiny-but-tiny first NYC apartment. For 364 days of the year, it sits forgotten in a cabinet in my parents\u2019 dining room. I pull it out exactly once a year when my sister and I go home for Mother\u2019s Day weekend and I make us Sunday morning brunch.For a family with very few long-standing traditions, I\u2019m always surprised this one has stuck. Every year, I use the same recipe from our orange plastic recipe binder (Pam Anderson\u2019s Light and Crispy Waffles, which incorporate whipped egg whites into the batter to yield golden-brown grids that live up to their name.) I always take the same photo of my mom before we start eating: posed, smiling, with her fork and knife positioned above her dinner-plate-size waffle covered in berries, powdered sugar, and syrup, the way she likes it. And I always make extras for my dad, who claims he\u2019s going to eat just one but reliably has two and a half.Mother\u2019s Day waffles, two years ago.\nOf course, I\u2019m not going home this weekend, even though my parents live only 25 miles from me and I haven\u2019t seen my mom since February. Since waffles don\u2019t ship particularly well, this year I sent her a small care package (hard plug for the USPS, which did a contactless pickup right from my porch!) I had to fill the box mostly with items scavenged from my apartment, which naturally meant there was a lot of food: a cute old metal biscuit tin filled with homemade biscotti, her favorite coffee hour nibble; fat green olives from Caputo\u2019s, a fine-foods retailer based in Salt Lake City that I love; a baggie of instant yeast for baking experiments; and a homemade \u201cdry mix\u201d for a poppy loaf cake I know she\u2019s been craving, that needs just milk, eggs, and oil to transform it into cake. (And a card I bought five years ago and have forgotten to send in the mail every year since...*grimace emoji*)Claire Saffitz's Grapefruit\u2013Poppy Seed Loaf Cake is always a winner.\nAlex LauBut while the care package is nice and all, it still doesn\u2019t resolve the fact that I can\u2019t give my mom the one food she looks forward to all year: her waffle. For the sake of keeping tradition alive\u2014which seems more important this year than ever\u2014I texted my dad earlier this week: Do you want to attempt to make waffles for a Mother\u2019s Day Zoom brunch? (He recently discovered Zoom and LOVES it, l assume because he\u2019s learned how to use the pretty filter.) I then received a long string of texts from him including: \u201cNot sure where the orange binder is. Lol.\u201d \u201cOops. Ran out of vanilla extract.\u201d \u201cAlso don\u2019t have milk.\u201dBut, bless him, he\u2019s agreed to try. I\u2019m not sure I have total confidence in his waffle-making abilities, but I do know I will have a very, very big smile on my face when I get to see my mom eating one on Zoom...no pretty filter needed.Okay, I\u2019m crying now, bye!Christina ChaeyAssociate editorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishMother's DayWhat's Chaey Cooking?essayRead MorecultureMeal Planning > Meal PreppingBy Christina ChaeyRecipes you want to make.
