If fruit with chocolate isn\u2019t your cup of tea, feel free to omit the latter.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Excellent texture and fantastic flavor. I got a package of halwa recently and was excited to use it; I found that the flavor did come through but isn\u2019t overly strong. Like others noticed, the dough was very wet. I added 1/4 cup flour and refrigerated them for 15 minutes before baking, but they still spread significantly and didn\u2019t rise much. We weren\u2019t able to cut them in half laterally like most shortcakes but instead cut them in half vertically and just stacked the two halves. I would definitely recommend lessening the liquid too to prevent that!AshMonroe, WA1/15/2022I just made the dough (which was delicious raw) and agree it was very wet and so sticky - I added more flour too - but perhaps not enough as I am not a seasoned baker and didn't want to over do it, they are currently in the freezer chilling! I hope they work out as they are a birthday request for my daughter. LydiaCharlottesville, VA8/28/2021Yes to this. Made with gluten free flour and it worked great. Batter was gooey, but I chilled in freezer for a bit and that helped. Loved this recipe - will make again!AnonymousMinneapolis, MN8/28/2021I really enjoyed this recipe! What a lovely texture :)\nI did, however, find the dough much too wet and decided not to add the full amount of egg mix to the dry ingredients so that the dough could be handled. I also decided to leave out the chocolate chips in order to make sure I could taste the halva - it worked. Delicious!AJLondon, UK8/11/2021Not sure if the halva really adds much to the shortcakes, I didn't really taste it, the whole product is very good though. The chocolate in particular added to the shortcakes is incredible but I think it also overpowers the halva. Had to add a lot more flour (like maybe 1/4 cup) than specified to get the biscuits to be able to be handled at all, they were so gooey. Will be making this again but might omit the halva since I don't think I'll miss it (though I loved the idea of it).StephLos Angeles, CA8/8/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titBiscuitFruit DessertDessertStrawberryBerryFruitChocolateOther IngredientsSummerBakingRecipes you want to make.
