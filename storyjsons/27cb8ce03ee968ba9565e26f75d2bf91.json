It was a bit overdressed so I think I'd use more escarole next time or add the dressing as needed to the escarole, rather than mixing in the same bowl that we made the dressing it. isabellecooks965/8/2020This is a great basic salad recipe to riff on! I didn't have sardines or escarole so I used anchovies and romaine for a classic caesar. I found that 1/3 cup of mayo was more than enough for the salad dressing.  Great for using homemade croutons if you have some stale bread lying around!AnonymousWorcester,MA4/4/2020Everything Molly creates is delish!! I love salads and sardines and never thought about combining those 2 in a delicious dish! gutierrezja4/3/2020This was really good. I didn\u2019t have any hazelnuts so I used walnuts, but I think next time I\u2019ll skip nuts and add croutons for crunch.
