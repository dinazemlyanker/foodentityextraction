This is where Brad Leone (who you might know from \u201cIt\u2019s Alive\u201d) stores his various experiments. A vat of kombucha bubbles next to a crock of sauerkraut next to a bottle of cherry wine among jars of who-knows-what. One of those jars is Brad\u2019s not-FDA-approved immune system booster, fermented garlic honey. A spoonful, he swears, will prevent you from the cubicle germs circulating at all times.\u201cThis was a Brad original,\u201d it\u2019s true, said Andy Baraghani, who wrote the formal recipe we just published with a few other new garlic condiments, like garlic-chile vinegar and confit garlic. The recipe goes like this: peel a ton of garlic, crush it, pour raw honey over \u2018em, wait a week.Why crush it? That releases the allicin, the oxygenated sulfur compound that gives garlic its stink, and therefore the honey really takes on that garlic flavor. Everything in the jar bubbles during the process, and when the bubbles stop, fermentation stops, and that\u2019s the best time to eat it, per Brad. This is usually after the week depending on some environmental factors. (\u201cI like to go for two,\u201d said Brad, with the but-that\u2019s-just-me hand gesture.) As the garlic ferments, it softens and mellows, which means it's fair game too\u2014you can easily eat a clove and go back for more.\u201cIt\u2019s a safe thing,\u201d Brad said, totally unprompted.\u201cI didn\u2019t say it was ...dangerous,\u201d I replied.\u201cTotally safe,\u201d he repeated. Uhhh okay.We compared two jars from Fermentation Alley. One was close to two years old.\u201cMaybe not so safe,\u201d he noted of the darkened, silky liquid that none of us dared to taste.\u201cSomebody\u2019s gonna die,\u201d said Andy. Instead we tried the fresher garlic honey that Andy had made, which had a nutty molasses note.These chicken thighs could use garlic honey in place of hot honey and be PHENOMENAL.\nThe honey makes a great pizza topping, a funky-sweetener for vinaigrette, drizzled on feta and flatbread, a glaze with lemon and olive oil for chicken thighs, or on the side of a cheese plate. Go crazy and sear some halloumi cheese and then dress it with garlic honey and wonder why you never did this before. Andy likes to thin it with some vinegar, add a ton of black pepper, and toss in bitter greens like radicchio or arugula. Brad...likes it on pizza.\u201cAnd grilled cheese, HELLO!\u201d He interjected.Get the recipe:Fermented Garlic HoneyYou can drizzle this honey over pepperoni pizza (trust!), serve alongside spicy fried chicken, and more.View Recipe*Please talk to your doctor before ever accepting medical advice from Brad.Explore Bon App\u00e9titGarlicFermentationhoneyBrad LeoneRecipes you want to make.
