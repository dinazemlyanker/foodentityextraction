Named for the sizzling \u201csay-ow\u201d (x\u00e8o) sound the batter makes when it hits the hot pan (could there be a better noise than that?), they\u2019re a hands-on eating experience: Snip the crepe with scissors, wrap it in soft lettuce and zippy herbs, and dunk it in spicy-tangy n\u01b0\u1edbc ch\u1ea5m (\u201cnook chum\u201d), the go-to dipping sauce of Vietnam, before shoving it all into your mouth. The combination of textures and flavors hijacks all pleasure centers.Personally, I don\u2019t just like the southern Vietnamese specialty. I adore it. I grew up eating my mom\u2019s homemade sizzling rice crepes, which always filled the house with a distinctive fragrance of rice, pork, and shrimp kissed by a delicate coconut sweetness. On my first trip back to Vietnam in 2003, I filled up in bustling Saigon (a.k.a. Ho Chi Minh City) where a bevy of women cooks commanded big hot skillets to craft crepes as wide as Indian dosas. Further north in quaint and more conservative Hoi An, a food hawker gingerly handed me one the size of taco, wrapped in a very thin sheath of rice paper. (In Hue, Vietnam\u2019s ancient capital in the central region, there\u2019s a b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o kin named b\u00e1nh kho\u00e1i, which are shallow fried and super crunchy, and served with a bean sauce flavored by a touch of liver.)Over the years, I\u2019ve eaten b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o (\u201cbaan say-ow\u201d) at historic spots like B\u00e1nh X\u00e8o 46A \u0110inh C\u00f4ng Tr\u00e1ng (which opened in 1945 in Saigon), casual alleyway joints, and at open air wet markets. I\u2019ve observed professional cooks frying crepes over charcoal braziers and chatted up others to learn that they use lard for flavor and grind their own rice to make the turmeric tinted batter. And I\u2019ve formulated a few b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o recipes myself: ones that involve soaking rice and mung beans for the batter, and others that use superfine Thai rice flour and cornstarch as a shortcut\u2014like the version in my latest cookbook, Vietnamese Food Any Day.Recently, stuck at home and not too eager to venture far to satisfy my crepe craving, I sought to make the Viet treat with ingredients I could find at my local supermarket\u2014evolving and expanding on our food traditions the same way my family had when they first arrived in the States. With that spirit, and the current season, as my guiding force, I landed on this perfectly spring-y b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o recipe with succulent large frozen shrimp, crunchy, quick-cooking snap peas, and sturdy red cabbage to balance out the sweetness and add loft, too. Though not entirely traditional, it\u2019s a joyous riot of color and flavors\u2014the essence of what makes Viet food so damn appealing.Here\u2019s how it all came together, plus some tips for creating your own version. Once you understand the basics, you can get creative with it and use whatever ingredients are accessible to you.The CrepeThe main obstacle to perfectly crispy crepes is the flour. The white rice flour sold at mainstream grocery stores and heath food markets yields gritty batter because it is coarser than what\u2019s produced in Southeast Asia, where rice is soaked then ground to a superfine texture. Treating American rice flour like Thai rice flour and/or adjusting other ingredient proportions yielded fail after fail. Then one day, I tried making the batter with super-hot water. Bingo! The rice starch softened enough to yield satisfying crepes. Compared to the traditional ones, what I made from rice flour by American producers like Bob\u2019s Red Mill are crunchier and heartier, but these New World crepes were wonderfully delicious in their own right.The FillingMost b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o contain the usual suspects: thinly sliced pork or nubby bits of ground pork, small shell-on shrimp, mung beans (the legume and raw sprouts), and mushroom. Classics endure for a reason, but faced with inconsistent (sad) bean sprouts at my local supermarkets, I began changing up the filling, choosing ingredients like shredded red cabbage to replace the sprouts and chicken thigh in lieu of pork. Then of course, there\u2019s this snap pea version.You could always try subbing half of the snap peas with thickly sliced cremini or fresh shiitake mushroom (use 2 or 3 medium ones and include stems). Oyster mushrooms work, too. Maitake turned out too firm for my taste but you may like it. Just cook the mushroom with the shrimp and onion to draw out their umami. But why stop there? Anything low-moisture should work to avoid sogging up the crepe.The Lettuce Wrap and HerbsBe freewheeling with the raw produce. If mild tasting mustard greens are available, add them to the lettuce-and-herb plate for a Saigon experience (use a large leaf to wrap the crepe with, or tear off a piece and include it in the lettuce wrap). If you have other fresh herbs, such as basil (Thai or lemon would be divine) or purple-and-green perilla (called t\u00eda t\u00f4 in Vietnamese) include them with the cilantro and mint.To ServeThe batter holds for a couple days, which means you can make it in advance; the sauce is best the day it\u2019s made. My husband and I can easily devour three in one sitting, whether that\u2019s for brunch, lunch, or dinner. Serve alongside with lots of wine and beer.Get the recipe:Shrimp and Sugar Snap Pea B\u00e1nh X\u00e8o (Vietnamese Sizzling Rice Crepes)Crispy and chewy, zippy and savory, and eaten by the handful\u2014you won\u2019t be able to stop at just one.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titVietnameseSpringRecipes you want to make.
