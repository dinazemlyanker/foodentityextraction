See our past recommendations here!Yaupon Brothers\u2019 lavender-coconut tea is not my usual...cup of tea. I\u2019m a pretty loyal oolong/green/jasmine drinker. Coconut? How\u2019d you get in here? But when I tried it at the Fancy Food Show this year, I was entranced. It was refreshing and summery, and unlike anything I\u2019d ever had before. The flavor was barely floral, fragrant with coconut and a slightly green undertone.Yaupon is\u2014fun fact\u2014the only known caffeinated plant native to the U.S. (It\u2019s a tree, and the tea is made from the holly-like leaves.) It\u2019s packed with antioxidants and roughly the same amount of caffeine as yerba mate. Yaupon Brothers\u2014based in Florida, where the Timucua tribe once grew, drank, traded, and used yaupon in religious ceremonies\u2014acknowledges Native Americans\u2019 thousand-plus-year history with the plant by sending a portion of sales to NATIFS, a non-profit founded by chef Sean Sherman that re-establishes indigenous foodways to generate wealth and improve health in Native communities.The company also produces a traditional green tea, a spiced chai, and a \u201cfire-roasted\u201d tea in addition to the lavender-coconut. I cold brew a bag in a pint of water overnight, and the next day, it\u2019s lightly infused and ready to go. You could doctor it up with maple syrup and a squeeze of lemon, or oomph up the flavor by cold-steeping two or three tea bags at once. Just imagine how cuuute it could be in a pitcher with a sprig of fresh lavender as garnish. \u2014Alex Beggs, senior staff writerBuy it: Lavender Coconut Yaupon Tea, $8All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
