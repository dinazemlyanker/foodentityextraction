Place in a medium bowl; season with kosher salt. Using a Microplane, finely grate lemongrass, chile, ginger, and garlic into bowl. Add sesame oil, if using, and brown sugar and toss to combine. Let sit at least 10 minutes or up to 1 hour.Step 2Meanwhile, trim stem ends from beans. Slice beans in half lengthwise (or you can slice each at a steep diagonal into a few pieces\u2014this will help them cook a bit more quickly). Transfer to a small bowl, add corn, and toss to combine.Step 3Heat 1 Tbsp. olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add half of beef mixture in a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until well browned underneath, 1\u20132 minutes. Toss and cook until nearly cooked through but still pink in spots, 30\u201360 seconds longer. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with 1 Tbsp. olive oil and remaining beef mixture.Step 4Cook bean mixture and remaining 1 Tbsp. olive oil in skillet, tossing occasionally, until beans are crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Return beef to skillet along with tomatoes and half of basil. Cook, tossing occasionally, just to let flavors meld, about 1 minute. Season with kosher salt.Step 5Transfer stir-fry to a platter. Top with remaining \u00bd cup basil; sprinkle with sea salt. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over.How would you rate Beef Stir-Fry with Green Beans and Tomatoes?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (3)Back to TopTriangleFantastic.  Made this twice so far.  Highly recommend.   It is surprising the flavor that is carried over from the marinade into the final dish, even if that is not mentioned in the recipe, it comes through and the flavors really come together nicely.   Never grated a serrano pepper before but i used a disposable glove.Lauren TChicago8/16/2021I agree with the other reviewer as to why no one has written this one up! Its terrific. I added one more Serrano pepper. I did cut up beans and remove corn kernels the day before since this had a lot of grating steps, so it would be faster. It\u2019s super tasty paired with basmati rice. And limes are key! DianneeeMaui Hawaii8/23/2020How has this dish not had any reviews? It was utterly delicious and comes together real fast, perfect for a weekday dinner without feeling overly full. I paired it with white rice, it was a hit!AnonymousVictoria, Australia8/21/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titStir-FryChineseEast AsianAsianThaiSoutheast AsianShort RibBeefMeatLemongrassHerbs & SpicesJalape\u00f1oChileVegetableCherry TomatoTomatoBasilGreen BeanEasyOne-Pot MealsWeeknight MealsMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeHealthyishFrySaut\u00e9DinnerRecipes you want to make.
