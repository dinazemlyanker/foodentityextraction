As a youngster I gave little thought to the funny-looking mini-spatula with a rectangular hole. It wasn't until a cheese basket arrived one holiday season from some friends in Wisconsin that I understood its utility, watching my mother shave perfectly symmetrical hunks and arrange the neatest cheese plate our kitchen had ever seen. Needless to say, Mom always knows best, and I am now the proud owner of a very similar, equally funny-looking cheese slicer.Though any blade is capable of cutting cheese, this gadget solves many of the pitfalls you might encounter with a regular knife, like pieces sticking to the blade, or slices turning out uneven (leaving you with a grilled cheese that\u2019s molten in some parts and still cold in others). It was the Norwegian carpenter Thor Bj\u00f8rklund who first dreamed up the design in 1925, finding inspiration in his own carpentry toolkit: the planer, which was adept at neatly cutting uniform pieces of wood. Bj\u00f8rklund patented the design, and now, nearly a century later, his practical and dynamic osteh\u00f8vel is a common sight in Scandinavian kitchens.The built-in blade is where the genius lies. Position the sharp edge on your chunk of cheese (medium-hard varieties work best), and gently bear down to carve thin, equal pieces. The sliding-away motion of each cut feels natural and streamlined, while protecting your soon-to-be cheese-plucking fingers. Once sliced, the cheese is already balanced on the spatula, ready to melt in a panini, adorn a charcuterie board, or wrap inside prosciutto.But don't make the mistake of assuming the cheese slicer is a single-use gadget. It can do much more than its name proposes\u2014and faster than your average paring knife, too. I use it to slice stickier foods, like cold butter for warm pancakes and potatoes for crisping up evenly in the air fryer. I also whip it out to achieve shapely pieces of boiled egg, banana, and mango (don\u2019t be surprised when your kiwi tart at the summer potluck impresses all your friends). In a pinch, I even use The Gizmo, as I\u2019ve come to call mine, to slice cucumbers for salads and zucchinis for roasting. The slices are always shipshape, and I\u2019ve never accidentally cut myself. Can any of us say the same about a knife?Years after I first witnessed Mom\u2019s osteh\u00f8vel in action, the ingenious design still tickles me every time I fashion a snack platter, slice fruit for a bowl of oatmeal, or shave brunost (Norwegian brown cheese) onto crisp toast. But there is one caveat. Without fail, I always wind up eating waayyy more cheese than I intended. It's just fun to use, okay?Photo by Emma FishmanBoska Cheese Plane$10 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
