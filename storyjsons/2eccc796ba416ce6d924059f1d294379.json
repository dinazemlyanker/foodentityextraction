It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you\u2019ll see it before everyone else.She orders the roadkillA friend tipped me off to this wonderfully quirky story by Denise Weil in The Wichita Eagle about a couple, The Watsons, who dine at Texas Roadhouse six days a week, their only meal of the day. If you\u2019ve ever looked around the tables while you\u2019re dining, wondering who\u2019s on a blind date, who\u2019s about to break up, who\u2019s cutting a shrimp in half for the love of their life\u2014this story provides that glimpse into not-so-ordinary, ordinary life. My favorite detail is that the couple bought a $200 gift certificate to the restaurant around the holidays because it came with a year of free shrimp appetizers. \u201cWe\u2019re going to eat 1,560 shrimp this year,\u201d Mr. Watson said.Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Food Styling by Michelle GattonIt\u2019s a sandwichOur most popular recipe of the week was this kale reuben by Chris Morocco, a cheesy, sauerkraut-laden, healthier-than\u2013corned beef sandwich that immediately entered the vegetarian sandwich hall of fame, alongside Turkey and the Wolf\u2019s collard green melt and Rooster Soup Co.\u2019s broccolini cheesesteak. Of course, it was not without controversy. Some readers felt that the sandwich was missing something\u2014cured meat\u2014but it turns out they were the ones missing something\u2014the point.Get the recipe: Kale ReubenWant this letter before it hits the website?

Street Food will hit Netflix on April 26.When you catch up with a trend 3 months lateIt might look like this: a diligent Trader Joe\u2019s reviewer finally tastes the novelty pancake bread that caused a viral shortage at the start of 2019. Is it still worth the hype? Or has it gone the way of wedge sneakers?

Our favorite snacks were some Bugle-like corn chips, fried superdog bites (corn dog balls served with spicy mustard), and blue cans of Pocari Sweat, an electrolyte drink that tastes like human sweat with a little added sweetness. Mmmm.Unnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the week\u201cI\u2019d never say it out loud,\u201d Sarah Jampel said out loud (in a whisper), \u201cbut I like orzo.\u201d Hey, me too! \u201cI think of it as a small pasta. It cooks quickly, the shape is pleasing, and it\u2019s spoonable.\u201d Imagine a car coming to a shrieking stop. Christina Chaey shakes her head. \u201cWhy would you eat orzo when you could eat pasta or rice, which are both great?!\u201d \u201cIt looks like slimy lice or something,\u201d said Amanda Shapiro, who may have never had lice because, take it from me, they don\u2019t look like that at all. \u201cIt\u2019s very Silver Palate dinner party 1989,\u201d mused Adam Rapoport. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s some dill and parsley in the orzo, you\u2019re drinking an oaky bottle of Chardonnay, and afterward people go outside to smoke because parents still smoked back then.\u201d Scenic! \u201cI stan orzo,\u201d enthused Molly Baz, \u201cI like how slippery it is!\u201d I sent Andy Baraghani a quick text that read \u201corzo?\u201d His reply: \u201cI\u2019ll just say that I\u2019m on a flight about to takeoff and the word orzo already ruined my flight.\u201d Safe travels, Andy![EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: WHAT IS WRONG WITH EVERYONE?
