This recipe, where wedges are bathed in a turmeric-accented coconut milk until meltingly tender and sweet, uses just half a cabbage. It\u2019s enough to feed a family of four (with rice on the side), but you could easily use a whole one if you are feeding more mouths or catering to bigger appetites. To adjust the recipe, increase the stock or water to 1 cup to create more braising liquid\u2014you may also have to sear the wedges in batches and use a bigger pan to simmer. You could also double the amount of chickpeas or substitute with cooked lentils instead.\u201d\u00a0And for the other half of the cabbage? We recommend saving it for another night: Shave it finely, toss with mint, dress with lemon juice and olive oil, and top with lots of grated Pecorino and freshly ground black pepper for a quick salad.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I added a little red curry paste and a lot of nutritional yeast (great cheesy flavor). Added a lot more seasoning, vegetable stock, and some corn starch. Kinda hard to eat with the big pieces of cabbage. I might blend it up into a smooth soup later.Rae Kamp3/20/2022Great recipeAnonymous3/17/2022Can we please have this in metric?Vladmire Putipovancouver2/23/2022Delicious and super healthy! I mostly followed the recipe and  except, per comments, I roughly doubled spices and made sure the cabbage had a really good char on it. I also cheated a bit added a big spoon of Brooklyn Dehli Tomato Achar (an amazing condiment for anything and especially things with this flavor profile) to up the flavor and umami. I will make this routinely, the only further adaptation I would make is cutting the cabbage into 1/8s and cook in two batches, instead of 1/4s to increase char area. I let it all fall apart in the dish--wasn't as pretty but still as delicious. AnonymousPortland, OR1/6/2022I made this today: when I tasted it I thought the taste was a bit flat and watery. I added a few additional ingredients and that worked better for me. I wanted to keep it vegan so I added 2 tbsp of almond butter and 1 tbsp of nutritional yeast. The broth improved in texture and it was a little thicker/creamier. I also added 1 tsp of ground coriander. I served it with coconut rice and the final result was delicious. Another alternative would be to make it with coconut cream instead of milk or maybe use the garbanzo beans juice and forgo rinsing them.RolalaLos Angeles, CA12/16/2021I modified this recipe to suit me and it was subtle but tasty. I decided to have this with chicken thighs (skin on). Cook the chicken thighs before you char the cabbage wedges, making sure to render the skin well. Remove from the pan and set it aside on a plate. Carry on with the recipe as usual, but halve the amount of coconut milk without adding any extra liquid (I used water, not stock). Add the chicken thighs back to the pan at the point you also add the charred cabbage. Cook for 15 minutes with a lid on, then remove the lid, turning the heat up to medium and cook for a further 5 minutes to allow the sauce to reduce a little. I would say that if you're cooking this recipe without the chicken, you should opt for stock over water and possibly add fish sauce like others have previously mentioned.ReganNSW, Australia12/14/2021We love this recipe. It\u2019s easy, cheap and quick to make \u2014 what more could you ask for. \nEven better as left overs. Yum! Denise GNY 12/12/2021In these dark times, the sun setting ever earlier in this cold fall, this recipe brought the light and warmth back into our hearts. The yellow tones of the turmeric livened our weary spirits. So cozy, so milky, so curry, so satisfying, so would make again. Heed not the naysayers, this dish is fun to make, simple, while somehow also being very rich. It is a BA classic. Looking forward to leftovers tomorrow, ya'll. Added extra turmeric, used fresh ground cumin, and kicked up the spice a bit with red chili flakes. PrikonDurham, NC11/16/2021I made this today incorporating some of the suggestions below: I doubled the spices, added garam masala, and chili flakes. I doubled up on aromatics and the chickpeas as well. I let the cabbage get really brown in my cast iron, and chopped it up a bit before adding it back in. I also added some fish sauce with the coconut milk. I'd up the spices even more next time, roast the chickpeas and add them at the end, and chop up the cabbage more before browing to get more of those tasty burnt ends. AnonymousOAKLAND CA10/7/2021I've made this a few times. People do like this dish but somehow they don't eat all that much. I think it might be too outwardly healthy for the \"I'll eat vegan but don't make it look vegan\" set. Perhaps the gas-bage (as my mom calls it) is just filling us up. Fear not, I have a solution: THE LEFTOVERS MAKE AN EXCELLENT DIP. Blitz it into a hummus-y coconut mixture: Trick them all into leftovers; trick yourself! Spread it on sandwich, eat it with aged baby carrots, spoon it into your insomniac head at 2 AM, or thin in it out and mix it with pasta...speaking of blitzing, ingredients 2-5 can be chopped together in a device. make the robots serve you for a change.\n\nThe beauty of this recipe is it's so forgiving, buildable, and has ingredients that are all shelf stable. It works with red cabbage if that's all you have. You can put whatever spices in that you like (I find it needs something): I always add a bit of msg in the form of bouillon powder or asafetida / hing. Sometimes I top it with Chinese fried shallots at the end or I add smoky dried peppers at the beginning. Miso might be a really good addition, too, since it seems to need salt!\nGalus CassiusLos Angeles, CA9/30/2021Extra Chilli if you please. Otherwise perfect CaitlinLondon9/27/2021Has a lot of room for potential but needs some work.  Used a full jalapeno sans seeds and it's really not the spicy.  I used canned coconut milk but still found it underwhelming.  I sprinkled some garam masala at the end but would probably add: whole cumin seeds, hing, maybe some curry leaves.  Also love the searing of the cabbage and it's beautiful presentation wise but annoying eating wise.  Next time will probably sear and cut up on cutting board before adding back in.  Despite the numerous ways I was let down I did actually enjoy it and seems like a good off the cuff meal since cabbage can last weeks in the fridge.Desiree8/2/2021This recipe sounded like it would be perfect, but truth be told, I was under-whelmed by the lack of flavour. I had to add a lot of salt to make it worth eating. Maybe the mustard seeds in my pantry are a bit old, or I should have used canned coconut milk instead of from a carton. But even so, I would probably prefer a more complex variety of spices, per some of the other comments below re: doubling garlic, adding cumin seeds, garam masala, chilli flakes, etc.AnonymousAuckland, New Zealand4/22/2021FAMTASTIC-translated -Family loved it! I cut the cabbage in sixths and rubbed with olive oil and grilled to desired char. Worked great. I simmered for about 15 minutes while caramelizing some cauliflower and carrots in the oven. I added them about the ten minute mark. I added some curried mustard as I didn\u2019t have the seeds. Also upped the spices a pet pet other notes.
