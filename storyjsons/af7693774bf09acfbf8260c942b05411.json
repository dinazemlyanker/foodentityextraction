(The Breville one). That means every frozen food from Trader Joe\u2019s is 1000x better than before because the circulated hot air, previously known as \u201cconvection,\u201d makes every fried-before-frozen thing extra all-around crispy. (The tempura cauliflower, wowwwwwwwww.)If you buy a lot of TJ frozen stuff, you need one. The new honey shrimp are fantastic air-fried, so is the garlic and pesto pizza with deep-fried crust.Elsewhere this spring, Joe seems to have invested big $$ on vegan comfort foods, with two types of vegan bolognese made with plant-based nubbins, and jackfruit doing its best to pass as barbecued pulled pork.Reviews, below.New and Exciting Salty SnacksCrisp Crunchy Crisps Pea & Chickpea SnacksThese pea-pea crisps have the look of a flattened packing peanut, and are curved, scoopable chips made of dehydrated this n\u2019 thats. The flavor reminds me of veggie chips, which (who are we kidding) are made of potatoes. Indeed, potato starch is the second ingredient. A neutral vessel for salt and snack superiority complexes.Crispy Crunchy Champignon Mushroom SnacksSuck most of the moisture out of a mushroom, fry in sunflower seed oil, toss in salt, and TAKE ALL MY MONEY. I love these bougie little buddies. Some of the \u2018shrooms are chewy, some are burnt, but life is not interesting without variety, which is why we keep the special mushrooms in the fridge. I\u2019m not counting (I\u2019m very much counting), but a bag of these \u201csnacks\u201d is around 30 grams of fat, so I eat them by the intentional handful.Straight-Up CandyFruity Gummy CandiesReal gummies, with glucose syrup and everything! The tropical flavors are mysterious and inviting, like the blueberry that\u2019s so faint I wondered if they forgot to inject it with flavor, grapefruit that tastes like ros\u00e9, and pineapple that tastes like pineapple. They\u2019re sticky and super chewy, which means they\u2019re a performance-enhancing stress snack. Chew, chew, chew! Before it\u2019s you who is chewed.Fruity Chewy Candy aka Not-StarburstThese logo-less wrapped chewy candies are about as stealth as a celebrity getting coffee in sunglasses and a baseball cap. WE CAN SEE THAT YOU\u2019RE BEN AFFLECK. I\u2019d know that jawline anywhere. Chew, chew, chew!Chocolate Covered Wafer Cookie with Peanut Butter FillingThese wafer cookies are one giant wafer, as opposed to sticks you can share. They\u2019re inherently un-shareable, which seems like a product of the pandemic. Or it\u2019s just my new permanent mindset. I love the crinkle paper wafer texture up against the smooth peanut butter-esque goo. No, I cannot break you off a piece.Vegan StuffPulled Jackfruit in Smoky BBQ SauceSilky, tender shreds of jackfruit in sweet barbecue sauce the texture of hair conditioner. The jackfruit\u2019s doing a damn good impression of pork, without that chewy muscularity from an animal that was once alive and trotting. This pouched food fits well into my theory that all food is packaged for apocalypse bunkers now. Can\u2019t wait to eat this after the blast!Vegan Pasta Bolognese BowlWeird wheat protein crumbles imitate finely chopped meat in this faux-lognese. I hate them! And the dense, chewy red lentil pasta! Sorry! This belongs in the \u201cTrader Joe\u2019s Airline Food\u201d collection. Chew, chew, ew.In the Frozen AisleRoasted Garlic & Pesto Pizza with Deep Fried CrustThe deep-fried crust puffs up like an inner tube and starts to smell like funnel cake in the air fryer\u2014my knees weaken. It has green splooges of pesto polka dots, bubbly mozzarella, and no flaws whatsoever. It\u2019s so good, all puffy and garlicky and cheesy. Unlike frozen pizzas of yore, it doesn\u2019t get that dried-out cardboard crust. Perhaps because some evil genius went the extra mile and DEEP. FRIED. THE. CRUST.Carne Asada BurritosIf you want Chipotle, just go to Chipotle.Buffalo Style Chicken PoppersWhat tailgating visionary came up with this? Put the buffalo chicken dip...inside filo dough. As promised, the air fryer made the outer dough shatter like the dreams of a recent graduate of NYU\u2019s journalism school. After they\u2019ve cooled down for five minutes, as the instructions require, the buff chicken dip inside is still scalding lava. Don\u2019t take it as a warning, just keep eating.Honey Walnut ShrimpSHRIMP with FROSTING. Tastes like kettle corn. Either you\u2019re into that or you\u2019re not, but if you are, top with the crispy jalape\u00f1o pieces (below) for a spicy counterpoint.Pantry StuffCalrose RiceSticky rice in surfer cute branding because it\u2019s from California, where, as I understand it, the sun\u2019s always shinin\u2019 and a tsunami could hit any minute. Rinse it well, cook, and serve it like I did with this amazing mustardy fish.Ajika Georgian Seasoning BlendA spicy, slightly herbal blend of red chile pepper and a few friends\u2014garlic, salt, fenugreek, marigold (!), and coriander, based on the Georgian condiment. Something to play around with this summer when you\u2019re suddenly grilling for people with newly exposed chins.Mediterranean DoradeDorade always reminds me of this street where I grew up called El Dorado Blvd. and one morning on my way to lifeguarding I ran over an armadillo on it (he tucked into his shell, was fine). Fish is also fine. It\u2019s more subtle in flavor than tuna, with a tender, flaky texture.Magnifisauce!Burger \u201cspecial sauce\u201d that\u2019s so watery the spout is in the shape of a bedpan for easy pouring. If bedpan isn\u2019t a point of reference for you, wait \u2018til you find out what life has in store. Sweet and cucumber-y.Crispy Jalape\u00f1o PiecesIrregular perfection. I\u2019ve been putting these fried jalape\u00f1o chips on everything. My only regret is not buying five canisters in a hoarding frenzy. Oil shortage? Who cares! Crispy jalape\u00f1o shortage? WORRISOME.Matcha Green Tea Japanese Noodles\u201cWhat are you gonna do with these?\u201d asked my TJ cashier, who seemed genuinely curious about TJ\u2019s new slim packages of cha soba. \u201cMake a soba salad with a nutty dressing,\u201d I said. And did. The gorgeous green color is lovely; the green tea flavor is subdued. Summer is cold noodle salad season, so stock up!New Zealand Salted ButterVERY YELLOW. Suspiciously yellow. How is it so yellow?Good on toast.Almond Flour TortillasAs a loyalist to lard and flour, I was skeptical but OPEN-MINDED about the world of potential that almond flour tortillas hold. What a relief that these weren\u2019t dry and crumbly! Brava, tortilla innovator. They don\u2019t puff up as much as the ideal tortilla from on high\u2014Caramelo, there is nothing that comes close\u2014but they cradled my breakfast eggs (and crispy jalape\u00f1o pieces) without tearing. They taste as neutral as I feel about gluten.Jarred Sauces with Personality and PizzazzCajun Alfredo Pasta SauceAn impressive amount of preserved dairy in a jar. Mmmmmaltodextrin! But I try not to question processed foods. It is what it is. Extremely shelf-stable. On the brink of \u201cedible\u201d and \u201cindestructible\u201d and \u201csuspiciously tasty.\u201d The fennel seeds get caught between your teeth like tiny lies you can\u2019t take back, so just commit to them\u2014like that British accent you tried out in 6th grade.Thai Style Green Chili SauceIf you make ONE THING with this spicy, gingery sauce, let it be my favorite soup recipe of 2021, Christina Chaey\u2019s green curry lentil soup that Joe could never bottle.Vegan Bolognese Style Pasta SauceUnlike the vegan bolognese airline food, the understudy for meat is \u201cplant-based\u201d nubbins made of pea protein. And this is much, much better. Mushrooms, carrots, and celery do their vegetal aromatic thing while the pea protein floats in the soupy-broth with absolutely no idea that it is not ground chuck. And I respect that. Float on, little nubbins.Explore Bon App\u00e9titTrader Joe'sRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
