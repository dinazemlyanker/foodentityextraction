These guidelines will guarantee your BYO holiday is more support than stress.By Sarah JampelNovember 13, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiFacebookTwitterEmailA potluck-style Thanksgiving is, plain and simple, very logical: You can cross a handful of dishes off your scroll-sized list, free up kitchen (and head) space, and make your guests feel involved. Plus, your great aunt or cousin\u2019s boyfriend might bring something delicious that you would\u2019ve never thought to make on your own.It can become more of a stressor than a solace, however, when one friend shows up asking to use the oven and another, stuck in traffic, is in possession of the only batch of mashed potatoes for the party. To make sure your Thanksgiving potluck works in your favor, follow this plan. They\u2019re so helpful, in fact, they\u2019re also rules to live by when choosing your contribution as a guest.1. Assign within reason: A cooked turkey should move no farther than the distance between the oven and the table. Farm out salads, casseroles, and other hearty, sturdy dishes that can be carried under one arm (but might take up a lot of room in your own fridge). Cranberry sauce is the perfect candidate: It\u2019s easy for someone to transport, it can be served chilled or at room temp, and it only gets better with time, meaning your valiant volunteer can make it days ahead.2. Assign smart: The best assignments are good at room temp and avoid minimal \u201cfinishing touches.\u201d Ask a guest to bring a frozen dessert or a piping-hot soup and it won\u2019t be that way when it arrives. And unless you have burners, sheet trays, cutting boards, and oven space to spare (...who are you?!), think of dishes that can be made as far in advance as possible. And guests, don\u2019t leave any garnish prep to the last minute: Toast nuts, mix vinaigrette, and wash and tear herbs at your own house, then transport them in separate containers if you\u2019re worried about wilting or sogging. Leave only the final toss for game time.3. Know your guests\u2019 limits: Request that the perpetually late friend bring dessert, not an appetizer.4. Divide and conquer: If you\u2019re hosting a massive group, divvy up certain staples, like potatoes and stuffing, among several guests so that no one has to quadruple a recipe. (If you\u2019re the competitive type, you can turn this into a taste-off. Just kidding\u2014kind of!)5. When in doubt, ask for an appetizer: If nothing else, something to snack on will satiate any peckish guests, buying you time to finish setting up.6. Prepare to receive the bounty: When friends come bearing Tupperwares, make sure you\u2019re adequately stocked up with utensils, bowls, and platters for serving. Or be clear up front that the vessels and silverware are part of the assignment, and guests need to bring their own.7. Think beyond food: Get cooking-phobic friends and family involved by asking them to bring wine glasses, napkins, ice, or even a (really thoughtful) playlist. If all else fails, there\u2019s always dish duty.Explore Bon App\u00e9titEntertainingThanksgivingPotluckRead Moreculture10 Post-Game Rules for Thanksgiving DinnerBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
