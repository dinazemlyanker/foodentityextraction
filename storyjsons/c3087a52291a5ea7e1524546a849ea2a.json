See our past recommendations here!Who would have thought there were four words in the English language as ominous as: \u201cWhat ya got there?\u201d And yet, every day, as I toss whatever scraps of sandwich or salad I call lunch onto my desk, I fear nothing more than the sound of those words. Because that means Adam Rapoport, the editor in chief of this website/magazine/brand, is standing in the doorway of my office, watching me. And, of course, judging.There are many ways I could eat my lunch in peace, free from the inquiries of a man who routinely removes his shoes in the office, but the one that has worked the best is to pack whatever I\u2019m eating in an extremely attractive container made by the Netherlands-based company Mepal and sold via Food52, a site whose pristine aesthetic has led me to truly believe that the easiest way to improve all aspects of my life is to buy neutral-toned kitchenware. These bowls are technically called \u201cMicrowavable Nested Storage Bowls,\u201d which is interesting because I don\u2019t microwave, nest, or store them. I eat my lunch out of them, and my life is better for it.We love it: Nested Storage Bowls, $60-70 for a set of four.The key thing about these bowls is that, unlike virtually all things I\u2019ve ever packed my lunch in, they are not clear: They\u2019re opaque. And they\u2019re so pretty (look at the colors!) that if you kind of blur your vision a little, you can pretend you\u2019re eating in a real, maybe even ceramic, dish. (They\u2019re also much larger than bowls typically marketed for transporting lunches. Have you ever tried to bring a salad or grain bowl in something the size of a bento box? How do people do it?) And the opacity is not just about form but also function: No prying eyes can see what\u2019s inside.\u2013 Julia Kramer, deputy editorBuy it: Microwavable Nested Storage Bowls, $60-70 for a set of four.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
