If Only We Could All Be So LuckyA beguiling beauty.By Sarah JampelNovember 1, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Cyd McDowellFacebookTwitterEmailWhat is radicchio? Beautiful, for starters. While I try not to define anything solely by its physical appearance (ask me about my smart, generous, patient cats), radicchio is undeniably stunning, and the purply-red leaves make any dish more eye-catching. When I anticipate that my dinner is going to be brown-brown-brown, into my shopping cart the radicchio goes. (I\u2019ll pay for it\u2014both literally and figuratively\u2014at the cash register. A budget leaf it is not!)Radicchio, moving beyond its beauty and onto its identity, is a leafy chicory (as is pale Belgian endive and spiky, beguiling Catalonian puntarelle) and, fun fact to squirrel away for a future trivia game, a member of the Asteraceae family (a.k.a. the sunflower/daisy/aster family). The heads are typically small, and the leaves, while they can be tightly or loosely wound, are soft but sturdy, bolstered by crunch from the white ribs.Revered in northern Italy, radicchio breeds are often named for the place they\u2019re grown, and three of the most famous varieties\u2014radicchio di Chioggia, di Treviso, and di Castelfranco\u2014have protected IGT status. (They must adhere to certain quality standards, and production is limited, at least in part, to the namesake region.)Radicchio di Chioggia is what you\u2019ll most likely see in U.S. grocery stores\u2014either on its own or shredded and added to bags of mixed greens\u2014because it\u2019s grown en masse in California. It\u2019s spherical and small, typically about the size of one or two fists, with a surprisingly large number of leaves packed together in a tight bundle.Oblong Treviso leaves are matchy-matchy with tiny squash.\nPeden + MunkIf you put a hand on each pole of the Chioggia radicchio and pulled, you\u2019d get Radicchio di Treviso (in theory). It\u2019s long\u2014think Hey Arnold\u2014with mini romaine-like leaves. When treviso is forced to undergo a second growth in the dark, its leaves firm up and spiral into creepy tentacles. This firmer varietal is known as tardivo and is ideal for cooking, as it holds its shape.The real showstopper of the bunch, however, is Radicchio di Castelfranco. With yellowish-green leaves speckled pink and red and nestled together like a rose, it would make a mighty fine wedding bouquet. (Free idea!) Scour farmers markets for Castelfranco, then use it in raw applications that accentuate its beauty.What does radicchio go with?While the flavor of radicchio will differ between the varieties (Chioggia tends to be the most intense, followed by Treviso, and, finally, the milder Castelfranco) and individual heads, the general taste is bitter, lingering, and assertive. That makes radicchio a welcome companion to milder greens, like the babies (spinach, kale, arugula), as well as a punchy foil to creamy ingredients, like white beans and chickpeas, eggs, avocado, tahini, fatty dairy like sour cream, mozzarella, burrata, and ricotta, and starches like potatoes and winter squash.Castelfranco, just showing off.\u00a0\nPhoto by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiI tend to use radicchio as an excuse to add sweet and/or floral ingredients to my salads\u2014honey, pomegranate molasses, citrus, dates, orange blossom water, figs, juicy stone fruit\u2014until I remember that saltiness is actually the more effective counter to bitterness. Try radicchio with lots of Parmesan, chunks of feta, or torn olives. Or simply slice it thinly, dress it with olive oil, sherry or balsamic vinegar, and salt and let it hang out for a few minutes to soften and mellow.Beyond salad, most radicchio takes well to being cooked, which tames its bitterness (but also dulls the vibrant color). Wilt it quickly, like spinach, into pasta, risotto, or a simple saut\u00e9, cook cut heads on the grill until caramelized, or broil wedges or shreds in the oven until starting to brown. Another free idea: Spoon ricotta on toast, pile that wilty radicchio over top, sprinkle with toasted hazelnuts and reduced balsamic vinegar, devour.When is radicchio in season?Lucky for us, radicchio thrives in cold weather and is often harvested in late winter and early spring\u2014something to look forward to as we head into orange vegetable season. \u201cIntuitively,\u201d writes Farmer Lee Jones in The Chef\u2019s Garden, \u201cit makes sense to me that radicchios taste their best at this time of year, just when our bodies and taste buds are ready for cleansing bitters after a season of rich food.\u201d At the time of harvest, Jones explains, the plants\u2019 outer leaves look rotten and slimy. \u201cBut remove those and inside you find the lovely white and maroon heads.\u201dSo\u2026bitter, divisive, sort of slimy on the outside but beautiful (or at least colorful) underneath? I guess you could say I feel a strong affinity toward radicchio. Maybe you\u2019ll find it delicious too!Did someone say salad?Radicchio, Bean, and Feta SaladThe solution to legume doom: This citrusy marinated bean salad with crunchy greens and big chunks of salty feta.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
