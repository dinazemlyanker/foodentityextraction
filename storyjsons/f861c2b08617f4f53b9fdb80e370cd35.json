A deep browning on the mushrooms, coupled with garlic and shallots, brings the humble button mushroom to a higher place.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Bring to a boil.Step 2Meanwhile, do some veg prep! Tear off and discard stems of 1\u00bd lb. crimini or button mushrooms, then tear them into quarters (or in halves if small). Transfer to a medium bowl. Lightly smash and peel 6 garlic cloves, then thinly slice. Peel and finely chop 2 medium shallots. (A small red onion will work fine in a pinch.) Coarsely chop 1 cup parsley leaves with tender stems.Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 3Whisk 5 large egg yolks, 1 large whole egg, 4 oz. store-bought pre-grated Parmesan (about 1\u00bc cups), and 1\u00bd tsp. freshly ground black pepper in another medium bowl; set aside.Step 4Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high for a good 3 minutes. You want to get the pan very hot since adding the mushrooms is going to lower the temperature of the surface of the pan. Toss mushrooms and \u00bc cup extra-virgin olive oil once in pan to coat in oil. Cook, tossing once every 4\u20135 minutes (but mostly undisturbed), until mushrooms are mostly golden brown, 13\u201316 minutes. This will take some time and they will let out a lot of moisture before they start to brown, so stick with it!Step 5Once mushrooms have been cooking for about 10 minutes, drop 1 lb. orecchiette into boiling salted water and set a timer 2 minutes shy of al dente according to package directions.Step 6Back to those mushrooms! Once you\u2019ve finished the browning process, reduce heat to medium-low and add garlic, shallots, and 1\u00bd tsp. salt. Cook, stirring often, until aromatics are softened but not browned, 30\u201360 seconds.Step 7When pasta is 2 minutes shy of al dente, scoop out 2 cups pasta cooking liquid, then drain pasta.Step 8Add pasta along with 1 cup pasta cooking liquid to mushroom mixture. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring often to finish cooking the pasta and absorb liquid, about 2 minutes (this is why you\u2019re cooking the pasta 2 minutes shy of al dente; it allows for the flavors to meld as the pasta finishes cooking in the sauce). Remove from heat and let cool 1 minute. (Don't skip this step\u2014if the pasta is too hot when you add the egg mixture, it will turn into scrambled eggs instead of a luxurious sauce.)Step 9Add \u00bd cup pasta cooking liquid to reserved egg mixture and whisk to combine and loosen eggs. Gradually add egg mixture to pot, stirring vigorously with a wooden spoon and adding more pasta cooking liquid as needed to loosen things up, until a very creamy, luscious sauce coats all noodles.Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 10Add parsley and stir again to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning for salt.Step 11Divide pasta among bowls. Top with Parmesan and a few cranks of pepper.How would you rate Mushroom Carbonara ?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (102)Back to TopTriangleMade this yesterday for the family and it was a big hit!\nThanks!!!lookhereL.A., Ca.2/7/2022followed the directions exactly and WOW! this is a luxurious, restaurant quality meal that i made in the comfort of my own home. i was nervous about scrambling the eggs but the way the recipe was written makes it foolproof. this will become a go to recipe in our house. i absolutely loved it. alyssawest long branch, nj12/20/2021Loving the use of Puglia\u2019s traditional pasta, orecchiette, but vegetarians beware. Parmesan is never vegetarian. Genuine Parmigiano-Reggiano, or Parmesan cheese, always uses animal rennet. For the same reason authentic traditional pesto (which uses Parmesan) is not vegetarian either.PugliaPodcastPuglia, Italy11/29/2021UNREAL!! This was my first time making a carbonara sauce and it came together flawlessly! We had a ton of mushrooms to use including a portobello cap, so I wanted to try this. I am so glad I did. I used some farm fresh eggs, the yolks were almost orange... those are the kind you want and why I realize carbonara dishes in local restaurants (here in the US) always taste just \"ok\".  Real good yolks are key!  This was outstanding and after tasting it, I couldn't believe I made this in my own kitchen. My husband waa so happy. I'm in a happy food cloud now and just had to write a review. Thank you!!! Love, beers, and cheers -- Cheeks n' LeeCourtney and ChicoLong Beach, CA8/1/2021It seems sooo delicious. I'd love to try this. My son would love it!\ud83d\ude0b\nAnonymousLondon, UK6/19/2021Followed the instructions, but added fresh truffles to take it to the next level!Gary BBeverly Hills, MI2/28/2021Made this tonight for the first time, following the recipe exactly.  It was amazing and we can't wait to make it for guests. Anonymous1/25/2021Why the salt must be a \u201ckosher salt\u201d? BorisCA12/18/2020So funny reading others' substitutions because we did the same thing. My teenage boys have been a hard no on mushrooms, but I told them they could either eat this or make KD for themselves...they asked for a compromise, so I added pancetta. We also used farfelle because we didn't have orecchiette and it all turned out delicious! Had a small capresse salad on the side and it was a delicious meal. Thanks for such excellent process overviews...they make me a better cook at home. karensdHamilton, ON9/29/2020Absolutely delicious! The recipe was really easy to follow (after converting the measurements to grams) and cooking the mushrooms this way added a huge depth of flavor. This method also made it really easy to temper the egg sauce so it hasn't scrambled both times I've made it. Would highly recommend.AnonymousNorth West England. 7/28/2020Sooo flavourful! Really love this. Went vegetarian 6 years ago and haven\u2019t had carbonara since and thus definitely hit the spot! AnonymousUk6/23/2020Made the dish and happy I was able to make a carbonara sauce without the egg curdling. The dish was tasty, but I\u2019ve never been a fan of thick pasta. But it was flavorful and it did taste good. Hubby had two helpings.MercerisAsheville, NC6/12/2020So good!!!  Just made this for my husband and I and couldn\u2019t be happier. Time will tell if it will reheat for lunches in the coming week, but I would absolutely make it again!  Yes to fresh Parm.  I added some white wine...well, because that\u2019s my drink of choice while cooking. :) I have to agree with the other comments about the great tips for adding the egg in, also I would suggest using a cavatelli pasta, as it was hearty and substantial.  Can\u2019t wait to have this with braised short rib over it! AnnalysejarvisReno, NV6/1/2020Delicious recipe. I used fresh parmesan and had to use the recommended sub of red onion (who has shallots these days!). It was creamy, rich and perfect. Will definitely be making again. Don't skip the browning of the mushrooms. It really adds so much flavour.Anonymous5/27/2020Really wanted to like this recipe given the rave reviews but it fell flat for me. Flavor was very bland and one-note. Midway through eating it, I added a squeeze of lemon and red pepper flakes to give it more flavor. That said, watching the video was helpful and I'll continue to cook mushrooms this way - I just won't make the dish itself.AnonymousAmsterdam5/26/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titPastaCrimini MushroomMushroomVegetableButton MushroomOrecchiettePasta & NoodlesParmesanCheeseWeeknight MealsEasyMainVegetarianNut-FreeSaut\u00e9LunchDinnerBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
