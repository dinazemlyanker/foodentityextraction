Bring 4\u00bd cups water to a simmer in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add 3 Tbsp. butter and 1 tsp. salt and whisk to melt butter.Step 2Slowly sprinkle 1 cup grits into saucepan, whisking constantly. As soon as water comes back to a boil, cover pot and transfer to oven. Set timer for 20 minutes.Step 3Do a little prep while the grits are cooking. First, using a pair of clean scissors, insert one blade into head-end of shrimp and snip along backside all the way to the tail to expose the vein. Remove vein and peel shrimp (freeze the shells and save for stock!).Step 4Grate 6 oz. cheese on the large holes of a box grater.Step 5Trim 6 scallions on both ends, then cut crosswise into 1\" pieces.Step 6Smash 2 garlic cloves, peel, and finely chop.Step 7Remove grits from oven (careful\u2014handle will be hot!) and heat on stove over low. Uncover and whisk vigorously, scraping bottom, until mixture is smooth. Gradually add cheese, whisking constantly, until grits are smooth and creamy. Taste and season with more salt, then cover and keep warm over low heat while you prepare the shrimp.Step 8Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. butter in a large skillet over low heat. Stack 3 oz. bacon slices, cut crosswise into \u00bd\" pieces, and add to skillet. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring often with a wooden spoon, until fat is released and bacon is crisp around the edges, 5\u20138 minutes.Step 9Add scallions and garlic to skillet and cook, stirring often, until scallions are softened and white parts are translucent and lightly browned, about 4 minutes.Step 10Increase heat to high and add 1 pint tomatoes; season with salt. Cook, tossing occasionally, until tomatoes are starting to burst, about 2 minutes.Step 11Add shrimp; season with salt. Cook, tossing often, until they turn pink and the thickest part of the spine (where you snipped to remove the vein) is opaque, about 2 minutes.Step 12Remove skillet from heat and add 2 Tbsp. water. Cut 1 lemon into wedges and squeeze about 1 Tbsp. juice over shrimp. Press on back of tomatoes with a wooden spoon to release their juices and stir to combine.Step 13Whisk grits again to smooth out. Spoon into shallow bowls. Top with shrimp mixture, then drizzle with hot sauce. Serve with remaining lemon wedges alongside for squeezing over.How would you rate Shrimp and No-Stir Grits?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (6)Back to TopTriangleDelicious!!
