So while a \u201chack\u201d for cutting a whole bunch of cherry tomatoes between two quart container lids might seem gimmicky at first (and every time I do it in front of Carla Lalli Music or Chris Morocco, I blush a deep crimson), believe me when I tell you: This one works! This is the treasure! This is that pair of timeless vintage Levis. (Okay, simile stops now.)Here\u2019s how to do it: Place the first quart container lid on your counter, right side up. Then pack on the cherry tomatoes in an even layer and cover with the second lid, upside down (the rims of the two containers will act as a barrier and keep your tomatoes in place). Use a knife\u2014a really sharp chef knife or, my preference, a serrated knife\u2014to slice parallel to the counter, thereby halving all of those tomatoes. Repeat the process until you have enough halved tomatoes to make this Ratatouille Pasta.Sure, you could slice the tomatoes one by one...but, excuse me, do I look like I\u2019m made of time? There\u2019s TV to watch! There\u2019s news to avoid! Even though this trick has been making the internet rounds since the beginning of time, every time I execute it, I get looks of revelatory amazement. Or maybe people are just embarrassed for me? Using this 2003 \u201chack\u201d that got buried under piles of content?Whatever the look on their faces means, I do know one thing: I\u2019d totally beat them in a cherry tomato-cutting contest.Now it's pasta time:Ratatouille PastaIf we were to round up an all-star team of summer's greatest produce, it'd look a little something like ratatouille: Eggplant and zucchini. Peppers and tomatoes. The gang's all here!View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCherry TomatoRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
