We can\u2019t stop thinking about them.By Elyse InamineAugust 16, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Scott SuchmanFacebookTwitterEmailPichet Ong grew up eating a breakfast spread that would impress anyone with a sweet tooth: oatmeal-raisin cookies, coffee cake, coconut sticky rice, strawberry ice cream, and sweet tapioca dumplings. \u201cMy dad was big on desserts,\u201d Ong tells me over the phone, with a chuckle. \u201cIronically, I still do that now.\u201dAt Brothers and Sisters, an Asian-American-ish restaurant inside The Line hotel in Washington, D.C., and one of our Top 50 nominees, Ong begins each day with a slice of whatever cake there is (maybe it\u2019s the caramelized-strawberry mousse one or the ethereal three-cheese cheesecake) and an iced coffee diluted with chocolate milk. It\u2019s a deeply ingrained morning ritual he follows before he digs into his pastry director duties for the hotel: checking on proofing breads, doughs for tarts and crostatas, and all the cakes in progress. \u201cEating sweets makes me feel alive,\u201d Ong says.Pichet Ong, always a dessert guy\nMelissa HomBack in the early 2000s, he shook up New York City\u2019s pastry scene with his desserts at Jean-Georges Vongerichten\u2019s 66 and Spice Market, weaving the Asian ingredients he grew up with in Bangkong, Hong Kong, and a small town in Singapore with fine-dining technique. Lime and coconut in panna cotta? White miso in ice cream sandwiches? Green tea in flourless chocolate cake? Sure, it may seem par for the course now, but during that time, it wasn\u2019t.Eventually Ong left Vongerichten\u2019s restaurants to try his own thing, like opening his own standalone pastry shop P*Ong, which he later closed, and consulting with brands like Nestle to develop the now coveted cherry blossom Kit Kats. As he went further down the consulting path and a growing craving for matcha everything took over the city, Ong disappeared from the restaurant scene.Then, last year he quietly resurfaced in Washington, D.C. working at Maketto, a restaurant that sells Taiwanese and Cambodian food and clothing from A.P.C. and Raised by Wolves, alongside Erik Bruner-Yang, the chef behind Brothers and Sisters. \u201cI wanted to escape routine,\u201d Ong says. \u201cI wanted to start from zero, not to reinvent but to explore again.\u201d That meant putting down roots in D.C., where he has no reputation (his pastry cooks don\u2019t know even know about his career in New York City), and making giant, intricate cakes, which he\u2019s never really tackled before in restaurants.\u201cEvery day, we have a new cake and each slice is like a plated dessert,\u201d Ong says, getting excited.Behold the beauty of Ong's cake: The Copenhagen with pistachio nougat and honey\nScott SuchmanHis fantastic display of cakes at Brothers and Sisters has been the talk of the town since the restaurant opened in late 2017. Critics love them. Even our editor at large (and self-dubbed-not-a-dessert-guy) Andrew Knowlton saved room for them. You\u2019ll understand why once you\u2019ve spent a few minutes ogling at the seven cakes proudly arranged by the host stand. One day, you\u2019ll find a blueberry pie and cheesecake hybrid, crowned with a dollop of torched meringue so it looks like a cartoonish beehive. Another day, a towering yet delicate cr\u00eape cake, layered with Earl Grey cream and sprinkled with matcha.Just as he did in New York City, Ong has introduced his new home to his matcha-dusted, yuzu-infused creations. He tells me about a new addition to tomorrow\u2019s cake menu: a cherry, matcha, and red bean one. He\u2019s cooking down the cherry pits to make a bitter, almond-y paste that he\u2019ll balance out with layers of marzipan, matcha, and red bean.\u201cIt\u2019s come full circle,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m still fascinated with Asian food and French style, and here in D.C., I\u2019m getting noticed again for what I do.\u201dRead more about the 25 restaurant trends we saw in 2018Time to make some blackberry icebox cakeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHot 10 2018The Hot 10Read MorecookingThe Long-Anticipated New Cookbook from a Teeny Bakery in North CarolinaBy Sarah JampelrestaurantsThe Mysterious and Magical World of Burrow, a Japanese Bakery Hiding In an Office LobbyBy Elyse InaminerestaurantsTechnicolor Croissants and More Glimpses Into the Future of PastriesBy Leah MenniesRecipes you want to make.
