Yes, this needs liquid, some beer and orange/lime juice plz! And broiling is way better then a skillet to get those nice pieces of pork crispy..AngeloNolensville, TN3/17/2022Delicious! My only suggestion would be to trim off a bit of the fat off the pork. Also my Instapot said I was burning the food when I added the pork so I added a few splashes of chicken brothDTMCalifornia 2/14/2022Delicious!  Easy to make in a instant pot and crisp up after in my cast iron, perfect!  We. Are soft tacos served with pineapple salsa and that was it , my husband salsa it\u2019s a keeperMochiTorrance Ca 12/19/2021Yes, there is no added liquid. Yes, that is ok. I didn\u2019t get a burn notice, the pot came up to pressure and when I opened it after the pressure had released there was plenty of water and fat. I made a point of placing the fattiest bits down, to help rendering. I\u2019m not sure how much of the jalape\u00f1o came through; I deseeded mine because I was serving it to my kids. But the flavour was pure and porky. I crisped mine under the broiler after reducing the liquid and pouring the fat over. I don\u2019t have a non stick pan. Worked great. This is a fantastic recipe. Trust it. RachelMontreal12/4/2021As one reviewer stated, I got a burn warning also and took no action.  I guess the fat melted off and the juices from the meat gathered together at the bottom of the pot and the pot corrected itself. \ud83d\ude0aCacervantes Los Angeles10/20/2021I love when learn (once again) that less is more.  So simple and delicious.  Yes, you can add more spices and flavoring such as chipotle and oj, but this foundation is perfect on it\u2019s own.  I wouldn\u2019t even use a cast iron skillet. Nonstick prevents the meat from getting too crispy and dry.  What ever you put on top, I highly recommend the squeeze of lime to counteract the richness of the meat.  CacervantesLos Angeles,  A10/20/2021Don't you need some liquis to create steam and prevent the IP from displaying a 'burn' warning?\nPatsyOregon10/20/2021Add some oj and some pork fat if the marbling isn't quite there. Also a splash of stock! Save that liquid for a homemade tomatillo salsa.MRPortland OR10/16/2021This recipe makes some delicious tacos!TommyKentucky9/2/2021Burn error...duh because there isn't any liquid. Honestly I knew better. Very disappointing AnonymousCalifornia 8/18/2021Where did I go wrong here? It took approximately double the time that the recipe stated, plus I needed to naturally release pressure rather than vent manually. They were super tasty but I\u2019m confused! Potentially a daft question but I\u2019m in the uk, is there some kind of different between a UK and a US instantpot?LJHumphSheffield uk 7/26/2021These were the BEST tacos I\u2019ve ever made (and possibly ever had?). An excellent recipe & very easy to follow. I served them when we had a guest over and she also raved about them. This is now our one & only go to recipe for tacos! You won\u2019t want to make any others again. AnonymousSouth Carolina 3/21/2021Excellent - I love not having to brown the meat first, and honestly don't miss it.  I used a 5 lb roast, 2 minced chipotles, 1 Tbls kosher salt,  4 cloves garlic, 1 onion, 2 tsp of each of the other spices, and added 1 tsp each garlic and onion powder.  I seasoned the meat, tossed it with the aromatics, covered and refrigerated it the night before.  In the morning, I threw it all in the Instant Pot and added 1/4 cup orange juice (it sounded good to me) to cook.  SO SIMPLE!!!  The pressure was still releasing at 30 minutes so I manually released the rest to stop the cooking.  There was a ton of liquid at the end, and the flavor and tenderness are incredible.  Will crisp the meat this evening to serve, so this makes a terrific make-ahead meal for a crowd.  2 thumbs up!Kris MPlano, TX2/20/2021Can you make this without a pressure cooker?  Slow cook in the oven?\nBeth GLos Angeles, CA2/6/2021This is the ONLY carnitas recipe I will ever use again! I'm amazed with such few ingredients and no extra liquid at how amazing this turned out - trust the recipe, your IP will turn out fine. I subbed in some canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce for the jalapenos since I'm not a fan of them, but I think it would be fine to leave out the chipotle peppers/jalapenos altogether. In the past I've always broiled my carnitas, but throwing them in the skillet resulted in the BEST crisping I've ever had! I'm hooked on this recipe and will definitely be using it in the future.
