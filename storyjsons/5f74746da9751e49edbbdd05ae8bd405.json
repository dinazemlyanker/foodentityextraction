Curly kale catches the creamy dressing in its grooves and curves, which means each bite is perfectly dressed. Using mayo saves you the trouble of making your own. Finally, buttery croutons are my favorite part of a good Caesar, but there are never enough of them. So instead of the odd crouton here and there, this salad gets a generous shower of toasted panko breadcrumbs to ensure you get lots of buttery crunch. \u2014Jessie YuChenAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.
