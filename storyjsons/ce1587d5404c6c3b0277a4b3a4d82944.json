Founders Ben Ernst and Erica Bernardi started Vancouver\u2019s fastest-growing artisan ice cream company with a dream and a pushcart and have since expanded into four brick-and-mortar locations.ORDER THE: original hits, like the whiskey hazelnut or salted caramel, and seasonal flavors, like miso ginger or sour cherry goat cheese. The ever-expanding team goes for quality and diversity (there are plenty of vegan options) and folds in as many local ingredients as possible, like spruce buds.THE VIBE IS: cheerful and bright, with flavors of the day displayed on hanging clipboards. The staff seems truly happy to be there, swaying to the music as they scoop and graciously providing customers with plenty of samples before they buy.PRACTICAL STUFF: All four locations are open every day, from noon to 10 p.m.\u2014Lindsay AndersonGrant HarderGrant HarderExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
