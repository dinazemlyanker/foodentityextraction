But a cozy, winter dinner party is the perfect opportunity to try your hand at wholesome, savory dishes (bringing friends and family to you). From a simmering tomato-curry chicken to a butternut squash bake, these four easy-to-make meals feature Campbell\u2019s\u00ae soups and Swanson\u00ae stocks as a flavorful base and are packed with hearty vegetables, so you\u2019re feeding your guests nothing but the good stuff.By Campbell'sFebruary 19, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailChorizo & Chickpea Braised Chicken ThighsTransport your guests to Spain with this flavor-packed stewed chicken recipe. Using Swanson Chicken Stock as your base, make a tomato and paprika bouillon in which the chicken will simmer. The addition of fresh red bell peppers and briny olives add texture, while bringing out more flavor as the dish sizzles. Serve over rice or couscous with a bold red wine.Butternut Squash and Kale Breakfast Bake-StrataWhether you\u2019re getting people together for brunch or love breakfast for dinner like we do, this creamy veggie bake is nourishing any time of the day. Simply make a strata using eggs, Campbell's Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup, roasted butternut squash, and kale. The addition of leeks, instead of onions, makes for a milder, slightly sweeter finish. Bake in a 9 x 13 baking dish and set out for your friends to feast.Creamy White Chicken Pizza with Squash, Sausage, and SageWhen you\u2019re craving pizza but need a little nutrition, too, this savory \u2018za has the best of both worlds: vitamin- and potassium-rich squash and a creamy, cheesy finish. Roast the squash and brown the sausage, then top a store-bought pizza crust (opt for whole grain if you like) with Campbell's Condensed Cream of Chicken Soup, squash, sausage, sage, thinly sliced red onion, and mozzarella cheese. Bake until bubbly, top with red pepper flakes, and your dinner party is officially started.Tomato-Curry ChickenThis cozy, Indian-inspired hybrid is a cross between two traditional favorites: chicken tikka masala and chicken makhani, otherwise known as the saucy and delicious Indian butter chicken. Create your curry base with Campbell's Condensed Chicken Soup and spices, add chicken, and let simmer to deepen the flavor coming from the fresh ginger and herbs. Dish out over rice to sop up the juices and top with colorful crunchy herbs and veggies like cilantro, sliced chilies, and red onion.Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
