Specifically: How is mine doing? Is it feeling good today? And lately my butt\u2019s been saying, \u201cYes, actually! Very!\u201d Because I swear, after so many years, restaurant chairs have finally gotten comfortable. Could it be true? What does it all mean?Simple economics tells us that the cheaper the chair \u2192 the less comfy the chair \u2192 the shorter the duration of the meal \u2192 the more tables a restaurant can turn \u2192 $$$. To invest in a better chair means you expect people to stay awhile. There will be after-dinner amaro. There will be cheese. There will be nice Yelp reviews. With all those extras, who needs a table turn? (Similarly, think about the plush new movie theaters with recliners to lure viewers away from Netflix. We\u2019re in a Comfort Age, people!)Double-cushioned custom chairs in Detroit\u2019s San Morello.\nCourtesy of Noho Hospitality Group/Nicole FranzenMy own chair epiphany began when I noticed the double-cushioned chairs at San Morello in Detroit, the Andrew Carmellini\u2013helmed Italian joint inside the new Shinola Hotel. These wide bistro-style chairs, designed by Gachot Studios, support your achin\u2019 back at the perfect rounded angle. At other tables there are long banquettes and authoritative leather chairs the color of melted chocolate. Catch me swirling a Negroni, ordering the 30-day prime bistecca, and talking about my cat drama in one of those.I called up designer Christine Gachot to get her read on my comfortable chair theory\u2014untested by science, purely butthetical at this point. She confirmed my suspicions: \u201cOur dining experiences outside of our home and our dining experiences inside our home are starting to blend. People are expecting the comfort level of residential in a public dining room,\u201d she said. \u201cI think a lot of it has to do with the way people stay in hotels too. We design hotels as if they were pied-\u00e0-terres. We design residences as if they were hotels.\u201dFor San Morello, Gachot designed a chair with a removable, customizable top cushion, and a slightly higher-than-usual back, for upper lumbar support even when you sink into it a bit. It has a wider-than-usual seat (23 inches), which Gachot said reflects the size of Shinola owner Tom Kartsotis, who\u2019s 6\u20194\u201d. The legs are sturdy wood on casters that won\u2019t dut-dut-dut when you pull the chair out to sit. The leather on the banquettes will stretch and get even more comfortable as more butts sit in them, and the fabric will mature into a beautiful worn patina.The leather chairs at San Morello.\nCourtesy of Noho Hospitality Group/Nicole FranzenAbout those wider-than-usual chairs. As we talk about restaurants getting more inclusive, there\u2019s more to be said about restaurant design, which can seem to favor the aesthetic over the customer. (For more on that, read this recent New York Times report on how larger diners eat out.) \u201cA lot of restaurants are designed for\u2014you know\u2014skinny people,\u201d said Stephani Robson, a senior lecturer at the Cornell School of Hotel Administration who teaches a course called Principles of Food Service Design. The biggest thing to remember when you\u2019re designing a restaurant, she told me, is the kindergarten lesson too many have forgotten: \u201cGuests come in different shapes and sizes.\u201d A chair with arms might look stately at the head of the table, but it also might bruise a person\u2019s obliques, or prevent some diners from sitting there at all. We photographed the custom-made chairs at Benno in New York, navy Bellagio velvet cushioned beauties with cushioned armrests (see up top). The restaurant also offers armless bucket-style chairs and spacious, curving booths.Robson also introduced me to the most important technical term I learned about chair design: butt depression. Picture a barstool with a rounded indentation to settle your cheeks into. When a stool\u2019s too flat, you\u2019ll slide off. If the butt depression\u2019s absurdly small, you\u2019ll feel the edge of the seat cutting into your thighs. \u201cA restaurant that does it right is Marta,\u201d Robson said of Danny Meyer\u2019s Manhattan pizza spot. \u201cThe tops of those stools are oval-shaped, almost like a football as opposed to a pure circle, because that\u2019s how our butts are designed, right? You have a bit more width when you sit down.\u201dThen she got me thinking about the angles of the back of chairs. If the back\u2019s too upright, you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re on an airplane tarmac. \u201cThere should be a slight slope to it, somewhere in the order of 20 degrees or so,\u201d Robson said. At the new Momofuku Noodle Bar in Midtown\u2014the first location downtown was famously uncomfortable for butts\u2014there are straight-backed booths padded with hot-dog-like rolls that squish a little when you lean into them, reminding me of a massage chair in a very good way. You\u2019re not just here for a quick lunch bowl of ramen, but some mushroom buns, a bottle of sake, and sure, we have room for soft serve.One of the chair options at Benno, made in Milan by Colber and designed by Parts and Labor Design.\nPhoto by Alex LauSo far we\u2019ve been mostly talking about a certain tier of restaurant\u2014the two hour meal, not the 20 minute one. \u201cIn the restaurant industry, we don\u2019t sell food,\u201d said Robson, \u201cwe rent space.\u201d The more comfortable you are, the longer you\u2019ll hang, the more you\u2019ll spend, the more space you\u2019re renting. A cheaper, uncomfortable chair\u2014maybe it\u2019s aluminum or even plastic\u2014is a signal to eat and go.Then there\u2019s the \u201cthe four-hour chair,\u201d Robson\u2019s nickname for a seat so luxurious you\u2019ll practically be snoring in it by the time the meal\u2019s over. These are the widest chair\u2014because you\u2019re renting more real estate with your Chase Sapphire\u2014allowing you to cross your legs and shift positions while the waiter tells you the mythic legend behind the pork belly. I myself had a test-sit on a four-hour chair at the new Four Seasons Restaurant, armchairs that increased my net worth by millions the second my butt brushed the custom tweed. They come in three warm-toned colors that complement the five shades in the restaurant\u2019s terrazzo tile floors. Divine.After she broke down the details on the chairs at San Morello, Gachot told me about some of her favorite places to sit in New York. The original Harry Cipriani uptown, with buttery soft wooden chairs and worn leather cushions. Dreamy white wooden chairs with rounded backs and ivory upholstery that looks like buttercream cupcake frosting at Jean Georges\u2019 JoJo. I took a turn to complain about one of my favorite restaurants, where the booth seats are so narrow I nearly disappeared under the table. Why is this cool restaurant so good at food and so bad at butts?! \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse for it,\u201d said Gachot. \u201cWell, unless you\u2019re waiting in line for a slice at Joe\u2019s Pizza. Then it\u2019s excusable. Anywhere else, you should be comfortable when you\u2019re dining.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titDesignRestaurantsRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
