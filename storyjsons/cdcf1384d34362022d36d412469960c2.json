We bend over backwards trying to accommodate with gluten-free pies and vegan turkeys, all while trying to please our tradition-loving relatives too. (It's just not Thanksgiving without mashed potatoes, we agree.) Rather than spending time and money on extra food, we think the best strategy is to make dishes that everyone can eat and love, like this creamed spinach with a secret omission: There's no cream.So creamy and comforting, it could double as a blanket.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Yekaterina BoytsovaDairy-free creamed spinach isn't just possible. It's rich, creamy, and packed with flavor. The secret? Homemade tofu cream. We promise it works: Pur\u00e9e some drained silken tofu in a blender and you\u2019ll get a sauce that\u2019s as smooth and silky as heavy cream. (Just skip the extra-firm stuff, which won\u2019t break down nearly enough.) And because tofu and spinach aren\u2019t exactly known for being packed with flavor, senior food editor Andy Baraghani adds brightness with saut\u00e9ed ginger, chile, ginger, and scallions. These aromatics aren't traditional Thanksgiving flavors, but they add just enough heat and layers of flavor.This recipe has the best healthyish intentions, calling for a hefty two pounds of mature spinach\u2014not baby spinach\u2014which holds its shape well and has bigger crunchy stems. It will seem like an absurd amount of spinach but, as always, those leafy greens will dramatically shrink down. Add the tofu cream as soon as the spinach is wilted and bright green\u2014not even Popeye wants overcooked spinach.Once that saut\u00e9ed spinach is bathed in a creamy sauce punched up with flavorful aromatics, it becomes a side totally deserving of a spot on a crowded Thanksgiving table. And unlike nearly everything else on the menu, this dish stays on the stovetop\u2014so you can save the oven space for the bird. And if your cousin unexpectedly shows up with his vegan roommate in tow, or Uncle Jim forgets his lactose pills, you can get this from the kitchen to the table in ten minutes flat. Now that\u2019s something to be grateful for.Bring on the spinach:Vegan Creamed SpinachA Healthyish take on classic creamed spinachView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishVeganThanksgivingSpinachSideRead Morecooking58 Healthyish Thanksgiving Sides to Round Out Your TableGallery58 SlidesBy The Healthyish TeamRecipes you want to make.
