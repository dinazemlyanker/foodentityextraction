A lot of things were great about it, but my favorite thing was the coconuts. Real coconuts, lots of them, everywhere you turned\u2014on the trees and in the markets, and not just the big, green, not-quite-ripe boys but the sweet tiny ones with brown crackable shells, too. Inside is the most delicious-tasting substance natural to this earth, full stop. Water so pure, so creamy, with the subtlest sweetness and an almost umami-like richness. Flesh thick and tender, detaching from the shell with the slight prod of a spoon. Once I learned of these coconuts\u2019 existence, I\u2019d have near-daily whole-body cravings for them, which I could satisfy by walking one block from my house to the fruit cart on the corner and buying a fresh one with a hot pink straw for 10 baht, the equivalent of about 33 cents.Now that I live back in the tropical-fruit-forsaken United States, I miss coconuts more fiercely than I miss bum guns. And I tried, for years, to find a replacement. But while pre-packaged coconut waters are trendy and plentiful, none could compare. They were too sour, or too bland, or too saccharine with added sugar, or tasted too much like the vessel they came in (a box or a plastic bottle, not a coconut shell), or mixed with some bullshit ingredient like pineapple juice. When they came close to the flavor I was looking for, they\u2019d be too prohibitively expensive for a person (me) who needs coconut water like some people need cigarettes.And then, just when I\u2019d given up all hope, I found Vita Coco Pressed Coconut. It sat demurely beside its lesser brethren (Original and Twist of Lime, I\u2019m looking at you) in my local bodega\u2019s display cooler, swathed in shiny cardboard like the others. But there, on the label, beside the big green coconut featured on all the other Vita Coco labels, I saw it: an additional coconut, this one hairy and brown like the ones I remembered so fondly.My hand shot out before my brain even registered what I was doing and grabbed it. I paid the requisite $2.99, brought it home, poured it in a glass, and lo! It wasn\u2019t clear or slightly yellow as those lesser coconut waters are. It was a beautiful milky white, with tiny particles of coconut flesh evenly distributed throughout so that they melt on your tongue with each sip. The flavor was creamy, subtle, umami-like, as it should be. It was the closest I\u2019d ever come to an actual Thai coconut.Today, I am a Pressed fiend. I\u2019ll hit up multiple bodegas\u2014my record is five\u2014in search of Pressed. People will say, \u201cThe coconut water\u2019s right here!\u201d and I will curse them internally. \u201cNo,\u201d I\u2019ll mutter, closing the glass door with a thwack. And I\u2019ll head on down the road, to the next shop, or the next, no matter how hot or cold or late I am. Why? Because the minute I unscrew that white plastic cap, I know I\u2019ll be transported right on back to Thailand. Only Pressed can do that.Buy it: Vita Coco Pressed Coconut, $30 for a dozen 17-ounce bottles at AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
