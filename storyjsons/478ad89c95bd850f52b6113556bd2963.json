To reap the benefits of the warming elixir\u2014improved gut health and immune system, stronger joints, nails, and hair\u2014you\u2019re looking at least a full day of blanching, roasting, and boiling bones until they transform into a gelatinous, collagen-rich stock. But not all of us have 8 to 24 hours to commit to making such a fortified stock, and there are dozens of bottled, jarred, boxed, and bagged bone broths on the market now. But how do you know which bone broth is actually worth buying?We tried 22 chicken and beef bone broths, comparing them to the flavor and body of a great homemade stock, and found just five worth your time and money.A note on nutrition: \u201cThere is no concrete evidence that shows whether chicken is healthier than beef bone broth,\u201d explains registered dietitian and nutritionist Charmaine Jones (M.S., RDN, LDN). She suggests adding 4 to 8 oz. of any variety of bone broth to your diet each day, which can help with healing wounds, improving skin, hair, and nails, and strengthening bones.Kettle & Fire Chicken Bone BrothThis shelf-stable bone broth didn\u2019t smell like much of anything, so we were surprised that it tasted \u201cSO CHICKEN-Y\u201d and homemade. It had a nice body and the mouthfeel of a home-cooked broth, which was surprising since it didn\u2019t have to be refrigerated or frozen like most of our other picks. It was packed with a lot more vegetables than other bone broths: roasted poblano peppers, and all organic green peppers, scallions, tomatoes, celery, onion, carrot, garlic, and assorted herbs. The use-by date was a full two years after we sampled it, which makes it a great pantry-friendly version of chicken bone broth.Photo by Alex LauKettle & Fire Chicken Bone Broth$8 at Kettle & Fire$52 at Amazon (Pack of 4)Brodo Beef Bone BrothChef Marco Canora started brodo out of the kitchen window of his NYC restaurant Hearth in 2014, and its 18-hour simmered broth is now frozen and shipped nationwide. We thought it had a \u201csurprisingly clean, yet also very intense beef flavor.\u201d There were some notes of \u201csweetness and brightness,\u201d and it coats your palate in a very comforting way, like mom\u2019s homemade soup. It has a lot of strong, beefy umami flavor, so it\u2019s best sipped in small doses.Photo by Alex LauBrodo Beef Bone Broth$13 at Brodo$130 at Amazon (Pack of 10)Bare Bones Beef Bone BrothThis was a \u201cvery drinkable\u201d bone broth that had a thinner texture than expected, but a \u201cpleasant, well-rounded flavor\u201d that we went back to for a few more sips. It was surprisingly shelf-stable with a use-by date 10 months from the date we purchased. Ingredients included beef bones, tomatoes, organic vegetables and herbs (onion, carrot, garlic, parsley, thyme), sea salt, bay leaves, and black pepper, and any flavoring was subtle and not overpowering.Photo by Alex LauBare Bones Beef Bone Broth$17 at Amazon (Pack of 2)$7 at HiveBonafide Provisions Beef Bone Broth\u201cThis broth has a very clean and light aroma\u2014no trace of barnyard,\u201d remarked one taster. It was a \u201cdefinitely drinkable\u201d broth but was a \u201clittle bland\u201d and in need of some flavor enhancers. We noted this could be a good one to cook with, whether for soup, brothy beans, or a batch of quinoa.Photo by Alex LauBonafide Provisions Organic Beef Bone Broth$140 at Amazon (Pack of 12)$13 at Bonafide ProvisionsSwanson Chicken Bone BrothThis was our surprise late addition supermarket pick. Swanson had more body than we expected from a shelf-stable stock and a little bit of a spicy black pepper note. There\u2019s a good chicken flavor that is a step above the bouillon-y taste you typically get from a mass-produced stock and an herby note that reminded us a little of Thanksgiving stuffing. We may not drink big mugs of this, but in a pinch, it\u2019s the least expensive decent-tasting option you can find at almost every grocery store across the country, and it will last in the pantry for a year.Photo by Alex LauSwanson Chicken Bone BrothEditor\u2019s note: We tested the organic version, which is no longer available.\u00a0\n$4 at Target$57 at Amazon (Pack of 12)Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishShoppingRead MoreLifestyleWhat Is Collagen, the \"Beauty Food\" You're Seeing in Everything?By Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
