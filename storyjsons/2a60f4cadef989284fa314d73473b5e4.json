You\u2019ve met. I won\u2019t be blowing any minds by explaining what Diet Coke is or how popular it is across the globe (and around our office\u2014Beggs, Jampel, you know what I\u2019m talking about). But have you had a can of Diet Coke recently? Do you remember how wildly delicious it is? I have. And I do. I drink it all the time.

Not in the mood to drink at the bar? The answer is...yeah, Diet Coke. It\u2019s a wonderfully chilled breath of adrenaline and happiness packaged in a 12-ounce aluminum can that\u2019s consistently good, every time.
