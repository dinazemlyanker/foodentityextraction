But this is a crucial step. Lightly frying the corn tortillas helps keep them from tearing as you roll them up and turning to mush as you bake them. This recipe saves you time elsewhere with an assist from rotisserie chicken.Variations on enchiladas are nearly endless. This vegetarian recipe stuffs the tortillas with kale, beans, and Monterey Jack cheese. If you prefer pork, there are Pork Enchiladas Rojas smothered in a red sauce made with guajillo, ancho, and morita chiles. And beef fans can try these Tex-Mex-Style Enchiladas with pico de gallo.Editor\u2019s note: This recipe was originally published on September 1, 2015.Ingredients4  ServingsGreen Sauce2tablespoons olive oil\u00bdonion, halved1poblano chile, halved2pounds tomatillos (about 20 medium), husks removed, rinsed2serrano chiles, chopped3garlic cloves, smashed1cup homemade chicken stock or low-sodium chicken broth\u00bdcup cilantro leaves with tender stems, chopped1tablespoon fresh lime juiceKosher saltEnchiladas and Assembly\u00bdrotisserie chicken, skin removed, meat shredded\u00bdteaspoon ground coriander\u00bcteaspoon ground chile de \u00e1rbol or red pepper flakesKosher salt1cup vegetable oil86-inch corn tortillas10ounces Cotija cheese, finely grated, plus more for serving\u00bdcup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche1tablespoon milk\u00bdred onion, thinly slicedPreparationGreen SauceStep 1Preheat oven to 425\u00b0.

Working one at a time, spread \u00bc cup chicken mixture down the center of tortilla and fold one side over filling, then continue to roll enchilada onto itself.

Did not fry the tortilla shells, however, did warm them up slightly and then dipped each side quickly into the sauce before filling and rolling each enchilada. Result was somewhat healthier enchiladas. Lipstick LibrarianNorth Vancouver, BC11/7/2021We ended up doubling a couple of things in this recipe and it turned out great! We used less tomatillos and it still ended up being enough sauce. I would recommend going heavy on the spices (serrano/coriander/garlic/salt-we used smoked maldon salt). The only thing I would add to this next time is queso on top with the cojito and the remaining sauce. The cojito is delicious but when it\u2019s baked it can get a little too dry. We\u2019ll definitely be making this again very soon! Yevannashville, tn2/11/2021Obsessed!! Thank you Rick \u2764\ufe0fAnonymousDallas, TX9/15/2020Ew! Poured the sauce down the drain and made tacos instead. Way too tart, way too spicy. Not my jam at all. I\u2019ve made pork verde before and it was excellent so not sure what the problem was here, but it\u2019s a no for me, dawg. alohalifeNew Braunfels TX6/10/2020With the number of modifications we had to make to this recipe in our quarantined kitchen, it had absolutely no right to still be as good as it was, which was extremely. It might be magic? You can swap the cheese, you can swap the chile varietals, but you probably can\u2019t mess this up. AnonymousFort Collins, CO6/9/2020I couldn\u2019t find Cojita Cheese so I substituted 2 oz crumbled feta and 8 oz shredded \u201cMexican blend\u201d cheese.  Based on another review I reduced the temp when roasting the veggies to 400. No burning at all but I had a LOT of liquid in the pan so I left out most of the chicken broth. (I wanted a fairly thick sauce.)  I loved the flavors and will make it again, however I will change to flour tortillas since my husband doesn\u2019t care for corn tortillas. AnonymousNew Orleans 6/5/2020Not to be that person who changed 17 things and made an entirely different recipe BUT we shredded the entire rotisserie chicken and doubled the tortillas (somehow was able to use the original amount of salsa verde tho, it makes a lot), used cotija + cheddar, and it was amazing. We grilled the tomatillos, etc for the sauce instead of charring them in the oven. Will definitely be making again. Thanks Rick! alexbeggsBon App\u00e9tit 5/26/2020Delish.  Actually, I followed the recipe as is and it worked out fine.  Sooooo tasty.Anonymous4/24/2020This was really good. The only thing I would change is maybe using a different cheese. Cotija doesn\u2019t melt very well.Anonymous3/29/2020Flavors were good, but if I followed the roasting and baking temperatures given in this recipe, I would've burned the house down. The tomatillos/peppers charred and burned the juices to a crisp. I had to cut the temperature down on the enchiladas to keep them from completely burning as well.AnonymousDenver11/12/2019In the past, every single recipe I have made has been very good.  This is the first one that disappointed.  After all the working of making the sauce, and the baking time, I had really high hopes.  I suggest more salt than you think it needs and more spices in general.  It turned out bland, and mushy.
