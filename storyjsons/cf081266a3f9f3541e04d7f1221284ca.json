If you want to grill instead, thread the shrimp onto a skewer after marinating.Ingredients4 servings\u00bdcup hot chili paste (such as sambal oelek)\u00bccup honey\u00bccup unseasoned rice vinegar4tsp. toasted sesame oil, divided1\u00bdlb. large shrimpKosher salt1\u20132Tbsp. vegetable oil2Persian cucumbers, thinly sliced into roundsFlaky sea salt2heads of Bibb lettuce, leaves separated, covered, chilled\u00bdcup mint sprigs\u00bdcup crushed salted, dry-roasted peanutsPreparationStep 1Whisk hot chili paste, honey, vinegar, and 2 tsp. sesame oil in a small bowl to combine. Season shrimp lightly with kosher salt and place in a resealable plastic bag. Pour in half of marinade and seal bag. Transfer remaining marinade to a small bowl and set aside for serving. Let shrimp sit at room temperature, turning the bag occasionally to ensure even coating, 10\u201315 minutes.Step 2Remove shrimp from marinade, allowing excess to drip back into bag, and transfer to paper towels to drain. Heat 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Working in batches and adding another 1 Tbsp. oil along the way if the skillet is looking dry, arrange shrimp in skillet in a single layer and cook undisturbed 2 minutes (the marinade will have darkened in color and some of the sugars in it will have started to caramelize). Turn shrimp over and cook 30 seconds. Transfer to a platter.Step 3Arrange cucumbers on platter next to shrimp; season with sea salt and drizzle with remaining 2 tsp. sesame oil. Arrange lettuce leaves and mint sprigs on platter so that each component is visible and easily accessible. Place crushed peanuts in a small bowl and set out next to platter along with reserved marinade (for spooning into wraps).How would you rate  Sambal Shrimp Lettuce Wraps?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (3)Back to TopTriangleThese are the changes:\n1 T Worcestershire (can also use Tamari or Soya Sauce, instead)\n1-2  T grated ginger\n1 T finely minced lemongrass (can use same amount of lemongrass paste to save time)\nJuice of 1 large lime\nThai Basil, Cilantro in addition to Mint - minced and added to cooked shrimp /prawns\n\nMarinade can be used with other proteins, including Tofu or with grilled vegetables.\nCan also be used on noodleslipsticklibrarianVANCOUVER, BC CANADA6/30/2019I've made this exactly as directed and it is very versatile and a good base for alterations.\nWithout additions or changes it is a bit one dimensional.\nFor this, I give it 3 stars. lipsticklibrarianVANCOUVER, BC CANADA6/30/2019My husband loved this dish. It was very easy to make and had a lot of flavor. I think the shrimp would have even more flavor if grilled.
