Meanwhile, traditional gay bars are struggling to survive, not because of lack of demand, but because of rising rents and high overhead costs. The spectrum of options has never been wider.It\u2019s in this climate that No Bar at the Standard East Village opened on Wednesday, one of the first gay bars inside a major national hotel chain. The bar, located just adjacent to Narcissa, the hotel\u2019s high-end restaurant, is aiming to be both a casual hangout and a night club, serving craft cocktails and fancy bar snacks. It\u2019s also the first high-profile project by creative director and former Mission Chinese Food executive chef Angela Dimayuga, who came on board last year to oversee the Standard\u2019s restaurants and programming. Dimayuga has long been a fixture in New York\u2019s underground queer nightlife scene. In 2017, she launched a monthly roving party called Gush, which drew a diverse, primarily lesbian crowd. Now, with No Bar, she\u2019s hoping to bring this subculture to a decidedly mainstream space.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.New York\u2019s first gay bars opened in the 1950s as a response to a social scene that effectively excluded gay people by law. These gay bars were intended to be safe havens, but they were largely owned and patronized by cisgender gay men, a trend that persisted in the gay nightlife community for decades.Oscar N\u00f1, the founder of Papi Juice, a monthly dance party started in 2013 catering to queer and trans people of color, says that most of the gay bars he visited when he moved to New York in 2011 still fit that description.\u201cWe weren\u2019t feeling represented in any part of it, from the music to the vibes to our own beauty and body and skin color,\u201d he says. \u201cI love Madonna, but when I go out that is not all I want to hear.\u201dStevie Huynh, the co-founder of Bubble_T, a queer, Asian dance party founded in 2017, said that as an Asian man, he was a target of discrimination at gay bars.\u201cThere is this saying people will use in the apps: \u2018no fats, no fems, no Asians,\u2019 and that translated into parties,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is still ingrained in mainstream gay culture.\u201dInstagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.When Dimayuga moved to New York in 2006, she felt alienated by the lesbian bars she encountered. \u201cI think people refer to The L Word a lot, but The L Word isn\u2019t really my scene or my people,\u201d she says. (The characters are primarily white and upper-class.) Other places she found were male-centered, not diverse enough, or simply too far away from where she lived.When Dimayuga took on her role at the Standard in 2018, she noticed that the hotel had plenty of great restaurants, but there were no venues  focused around \u201cthe programming and the people that make up the space.\u201d She realized she could essentially recreate Gush in one of the most recognizable hotels in the city. \u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity to go to a party maybe once a month,\u201d she says. \u201cBut to have a fixed place where you can experience what folks experience in these smaller parties,\u201d but in a more expansive setting, \u201cis exciting to me.\u201d\u201cI brought Angela on board because I respect her vision and abilities,\u201d says Amar Lalvani, CEO of Standard Hotels. \u201cWhen she presented the idea, it clicked as a natural progression of our culture of openness and inclusivity...a way to connect with not just the LGBTQ community, but the downtown social community at large.\u201dAt No Bar, there will be rotating DJs, accessibly priced food like oysters and schmaltz popcorn, and cheekily named cocktails like the Feel the Beet, with vodka, lillet, beet shrub, and lemon (plus an optional five-dollar CBD boost). The d\u00e9cor is best described as \u201chigh-low\u201d: cow prints mixed with silk, \u201cbuy 10 cocktails, get one free\u201d cards, and rolling papers instead of branded matchbooks. There will be no cover for events, Dimayuga says, and she plans to partner with the Lower East Side Girls Club and Performance Space, a non-profit exhibition space.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.She says the name \u201cNo Bar\u201d is a reference to \u201cNo Holds Barred,\u201d as in, \u201cthere are no rules here.\u201d That said, it\u2019s a hotel bar adjacent to an upscale restaurant in a gentrified neighborhood in New York, so perhaps the \u201cno rules\u201d part is more of a vibe than a reality. And it raises the question of whether Dimayuga can recreate a scene that's thrived in outer boroughs and pop-up spaces into a national hotel chain (albeit a very cool one). Corporate brands have frequently been called out for attempts at \u201cinclusivity\u201d\u2014like stamping your cupcakes with rainbows, like Sweets by Chloe did last year during Pride month. And the Dalloway, a high-end vanity project on the Lower East Side opened by Kim Stolz of America's Next Top Model and Amanda Leigh Dunn of the reality show The Real L Word, closed within a year.Brenda Walsh, the owner of East Village gay bar Phoenix Bar, which just celebrated its twentieth anniversary, said she fears that a bar in a place like the Standard would lack the community feel of more casual, legacy spots like hers, focusing  on profits more than on the people it serves.\u201cA lot of clubs do gay nights because that\u2019s where the money is,\u201d she says. \u201cSome places are only in it for the money, with the high-end food and drinks.\u201dBut, as Dimayuga points out, she has spent plenty of time partying with and creating spaces for the very people she wants to patronize her bar. And she doesn\u2019t think there is anything wrong with bringing this DIY scene to a fancy bar. \u201cThe Standard is a beautiful place, and we can lean into that,\u201d she says.Huynh agrees. He says the setting of the Standard is exactly what is going to make No Bar effective.\u201cSeeing people of color, queer people and knowing you are taken care of, and the sensibilities that you feel in a luxury space,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is like a little wink\u2014like I got you.\u201dDimayuga acknowledges that this place likely couldn\u2019t have existed without events like Bubble_T and Papi Juice, which paved the way for a new kind of queer night life. She also argues that the hotel setting will allow for even greater diversity because it will draw more out-of-towners and people who may not head to Bushwick for a party. \u201cIt could be a 43-year-old woman from Texas that is staying here on a business trip, but maybe also some grandmas, your parents,\u201d she says.\u201cOver time, New York City has become more inclusive, so I think the way we are diversifying has changed,\u201d she says. \u201cBars should now be more intergenerational, more diverse ethnically. That is the kind of environment I want to offer.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishangela dimayugaNew York CityBarsessayRead MoreLifestyleThis Diner Is a Queer Oasis in the California DesertBy MacKenzie Chung FeganRecipes you want to make.
