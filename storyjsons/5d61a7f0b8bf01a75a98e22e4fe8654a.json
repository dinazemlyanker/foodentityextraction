When something\u2019s so easy you don\u2019t need one. In It\u2019s That Simple, we\u2019ll talk you through the dishes and drinks we make with our eyes closed. Today, caramel corn.Popcorn is my everything. Besides the obvious (I snack on it at the movies, while binge-watching Succession, while road tripping, on airplanes), I also consider it a fantastic cocktail snack and an occasional meal. Kids and husband aren\u2019t home? Popcorn for dinner!\u00a0And while I might not replace an entire meal with caramel corn, I am still a huge fan. In fact, yes, I am that person who considers one of those large metal tubs\u2014the kind gifted around the holidays\u2014a really good time (and an excellent present to boot, if you\u2019re ever wondering what to get me).But you don\u2019t need the metal tub to satisfy a salty-sweet-crispy caramel corn craving. Just whip up a batch of the homemade stuff\u2014which is a billion times easier than you\u2019d think\u2014and you\u2019ve got the ultimate snack. It calls for only a handful of ingredients (which are all likely in your pantry right now), is a cinch to assemble (particularly when using my streamlined, thermometer-less method), and makes a whole bunch. Give it to neighbors or teachers of friends or hoard it all for yourself. I won\u2019t tell anyone. It keeps for days, so you can make some, eat some, save some, and then eat some more. And yes, it is also nothing short of an excellent snack at wine o\u2019clock.Here\u2019s how to make my caramel corn:Heat your oven to 250\u00b0 F and prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper and securing that paper at each corner with a little cooking spray. Next, make 10 cups of unsalted popped popcorn. You can do this (my favorite way) by microwaving \u00bd cup unpopped kernels in a large microwave-safe bowl covered with a microwave-safe plate on high for 6\u20138 minutes depending on the strength of your microwave. Or, if you\u2019re not as fond of your microwave as I am, you can place \u00bd cup unpopped kernels and 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil in a large, covered pot on the stovetop over medium heat and pop away, shaking the pot over the flame periodically. (More details here, if you need them.) Transfer the popped corn to a large bowl.Now it\u2019s caramel time. In a medium pot over medium-high heat, bring 1 cup light brown sugar, \u00bc cup Lyle\u2019s Golden Syrup or light corn syrup, 2 Tbsp. molasses (which will give the corn a little bit of a Cracker Jack feel), and 10 Tbsp. unsalted butter to a boil, stirring occasionally with a rubber spatula. Let the caramel boil without stirring until thick and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Now take the pot off the heat and whisk in 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal kosher salt, \u00bd tsp. baking soda, and 2 tsp. vanilla extract. Pour the caramel over the popcorn and stir to coat.Scrape the coated corn onto the prepared baking sheet\u2014you\u2019ll need to pile it on\u2014and bake, stirring every 20 minutes, until the caramel has darkened slightly and the popcorn is dry to the touch, about 1 hour. Let the caramel corn cool to room temp before giving it away in cute little bags, serving it in a large bowl, or indulging straight from the baking sheet.\u00a0But regardless of whether you share it with your pals or eat every last kernel solo, consider yourself warned: Caramel corn this good and this easy will be made again (and again, and again).Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimplecookingRecipes you want to make.
