See our past recommendations here!I'm not much of a dessert person, but eat sweets all the time: breakfast pastries, post-lunch chocolate, handfuls of candy corn when the season is right. But when I'm not trying to shoot my blood sugar through the roof, I've been eating Daily Harvest bites.Call me basic, but I love a ball-shaped snack. (Cake pops need not apply.) They're the perfect size for satisfying my sugar craving, and Daily Harvest's bites do so using only naturally sweet ingredients like dates and pumpkin. My favorite flavor is the cacao nib and vanilla, which is sort of like a chocolate chip cookie if you squint, but I prefer to think of it as its own thing. Yes, there are chickpeas. No, it doesn't taste like beans. The hazelnut and chocolate bites are silky smooth thanks to the addition of avocado, and the coconut and lemon version gets some zip from ginger and galangal.All the flavors come in recyclable cups and are meant to be eaten straight from the freezer, though if I can wait, I save mine until it's a little less frozen and a little closer to the texture of cookie dough. It's a two-bite dessert I can get behind, any time of day.\u2014Amanda Shapiro, Healthyish editorBuy it: Daily Harvest Cacao Nib + Vanilla Energy Bites, $7.75All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
