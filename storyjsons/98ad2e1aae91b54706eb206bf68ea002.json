But there will always be time to dedicate a charitable donation on behalf of someone you love. So for our last gift recommendation of the season, we asked a few of our friends to recommend the organizations closest to their hearts.Generation Hope\u201cWhen I was in college, one of my mentors shared how she got pregnant when she was an undergraduate, and that it would have been nearly impossible to stay in school if not for the support she received from Generation Hope. Ten years later, when I was a mentor for a youth poetry group, one of my teens told me she was pregnant. It was the summer before her junior year. I did not know how best to help her, but I remembered the group my mentor had mentioned and put Cici in touch. Generation Hope was also pivotal in helping my kiddo attend college. She graduated last spring with honors.\u201d \u2013Elizabeth Acevedo, author of The Poet X and With the Fire on HighThe National Bail Out\u201cThe National Bail Out is an organization bailing black mothers out of jail for low level crimes. We don't take time to acknowledge that the black community is largely a matriarchal community. When mothers are in jail, families are destroyed, meaning communities are destroyed. National Bail  Out does  incredible work, and you know your money is making an impact.\u201d \u2013Maya Shaw, owner of Shaw. lifestyle shopNational Domestic Violence Hotline\u201cI'm a domestic violence survivor, and the National Domestic Violence Hotline is the only national hotline dedicated to providing lifesaving information and resources to victims and survivors. One in three people identifying as women will experience intimate partner violence in their lifetime, but government funding for hotlines and shelters that assist victims and survivors is virtually nonexistent, and our legal systems are not set up to support and protect victims. The NDVH does incredibly important work to help victims escape their abusers when there's nowhere else to turn.\u201d \u2013Lauren Friel, owner of Rebel Rebel wine bar in BostonDoctors Without Borders\u201cDoctors Without Borders does life-saving work delivering free medical care to vulnerable people around the world. They have a particular focus on conflict zones and crisis situations. I saw the impact of their work with refugees first-hand when I visited the island of Lesvos in Greece, where they have been running missions rescuing refugees and migrants from drowning in the Mediterranean sea and supporting refugees in camps. They are independent and impartial, but aren't afraid to speak out when they witness human rights violations, giving them a unique voice in the international arena. All in all, great work!\u201d \u2013Yasmin Khan, author of ZaitounNew York Sun Works\u201cNew York Sun Works is a non-profit organization building innovative science labs in urban schools throughout the city. They have a phenomenal Greenhouse Project Initiative that spotlights hydroponic farming technology to educate students and teachers about the science of sustainability. We partnered with NY Sun Works to help create our public art installation, a living, growing rice paddy, on South Oculus Plaza at the World Trade Center in Manhattan earlier this year. It was an incredible, collaborative experience and this organization is doing such important work to further sustainability in schools.\u201d \u2013Danielle Chang, founder and CEO of LUCKYRICEThe AtticStarted in 1993, The Attic is a safe space that creates opportunities for local LGBTQIA youth to grow into their own and find their voice. As someone whose brand is centered on community, the idea of safe and inclusive spaces is always on my mind. I also love that the Attic works to reduce the stigma around being LGBTQIA through diverse programming and partnerships around Philly. \u2013Shannon Maldonado, owner of Yowie boutique in PhiladelphiaExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishGift GuidesShoppingRead MoreLifestyleThe Healthyish Gift Guide for People With Impeccable TasteGallery16 SlidesBy The Healthyish TeamRecipes you want to make.
