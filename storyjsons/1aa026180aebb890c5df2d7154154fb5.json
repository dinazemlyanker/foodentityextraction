Sure, sure, a steaming mug and a scenic sunrise is quaint, but I\u2019d rather spend those 30 minutes tangled in my warm sheets instead. Never have I ever had one of those idyllic coffee commercial moments where I gleefully spring out of bed before my alarm, just to sit at the kitchen counter by myself at 6 a.m. BUT, I will always hop out of bed for muffins. Moist, fluffy, pillowy muffins. And this brand new recipe for butternut squash, coconut, and ginger morning glory muffins from senior food editor Anna Stockwell is no exception. If you weren\u2019t a morning person before, trust: these muffins will get you.Normally, morning glory muffins are chock full of grated carrots (and maybe some raisins for pizzazz), but this new riff exponentially increases the cozy factor with doses of nutty coconut, fresh squash, and a bright ginger zing. I already know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cVegetables? In the morning?!\u201d To which I\u2019d respond, \u201cHave you seen the dazzling brown sugar crystalline crust!?\u201dIt helps too that they come together so easily you could make them half asleep. And let\u2019s be real, we know you will be. But after just 30-ish minutes in the oven (i.e. the amount of time you spend staring into space in the shower), you can be chowing down on a batch of muffins so satisfying, you\u2019ll question why you ever hated mornings in the first place.Get the recipe:Butternut Squash, Coconut, and Ginger MuffinsLike the best possible Morning Glory muffins but with grated butternut squash instead of carrot.View RecipeRecipes you want to make.
