Pickled Jalape\u00f1os Are VERY GoodJalape\u00f1os for pickle people.By Ali FrancisDecember 7, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhotograph by Isa Zapata. \u00a0Food Styling by Cyd McDowell. \u00a0Prop Styling by Paige HicksFacebookTwitterEmailI love every single recipe born of Ali Slagle\u2019s brain\u2014and it\u2019s not just because I\u2019m a fellow Ali. Each dish kicks, screams, and basically begs me to make it. Following that decree to its logical end, I am obviously obsessed with her latest: a wintry wedge salad loaded with plenty of exciting things. There\u2019s the salty-meaty mortadella that looks like Italian terrazzo and makes the end result worthy of wall space at the MoMA; there\u2019s the bright buttermilk dressing that leaves steakhouse blue cheese back in the 1930s (where it belongs); and then there are the jalape\u00f1os\u2014an already excellent food taken to zippier, more potent heights when they\u2019re pickled.Listen, I love jalape\u00f1os in all their forms\u2014blitzed raw into a salad dressing, charred and scattered over pork chops, and infused into fruity cocktails\u2014but I like them best when they\u2019re pickled. Not only do they, like the Midas of peppers, flavor everything they touch with their characteristic floral, peppery heat, they also inject dishes\u2014especially those that are fatty, cheesy, dairy-heavy, rich, and otherwise delicious\u2014with a much-needed jolt of acidity. When jalape\u00f1os hang out in brine for a while, they grow plump with salty vinegar, aromatic with herbs and spices, and a little less spicy (some of the heat leaches into the pickle juice). The eating experience also transforms: They\u2019re less of a crunch and more of a delightful pop-squish, like capers or Castelvetrano olives.Store-bought jars of pickled jalape\u00f1os are perfectly delicious. But if you feel like doing more work than unscrewing a cap\u2014or if you bought a glut of peppers at the farmers market\u2014you can make quick-pickled jalape\u00f1os (or anything) at home too. First, slice your peppers into rounds. There\u2019s no law against using whole jalape\u00f1os, but smaller pieces will soak up the brine faster. Bring 1 cup distilled white vinegar, 2 Tbsp. kosher salt, 2 tsp. sugar, up to 2 Tbsp. spices (e.g., peppercorns, \u00adcoriander seeds, and/or \u00admustard seeds), chopped fresh herbs (like cilantro), and 2 cups water to a boil in a saucepan. You\u2019ll want enough liquid to cover the peppers, so feel free to scale this ratio up or down as needed.Transfer sliced peppers to clean glass jars and pour over the brine, leaving \u00bd inch of headspace between the liquid line and the rim. Screw on the lids and let the jars cool before transferring to the fridge. Your pickled jalape\u00f1os will be best after 48 hours and last up to two months refrigerated.\u00a0Scatter them (the homemade or jarred variety) over chicken nachos, tuck them into a grilled cheese or seared halloumi burger, dice them up and stir a handful into your game night queso, or fold them into your cocktail party goug\u00e8res. Once you get to the end of the jar, you\u2019ll probably be left with some vinegary brine\u2014a.k.a. liquid gold. Lucky you! Use it to enliven just about any soup, like Ali Slagle\u2019s perfect mushroom number (of course).Get the recipe:Mortadella Wedge SaladIt\u2019s not like a regular wedge; it\u2019s a cool wedge\u2014and by cool we mean stuffed with pickled jalape\u00f1os and paper-thin slices of mortadella and drizzled with tangy buttermilk dressing.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
