In some ways, it was born out of a crush on New Orleans itself, a city I haven\u2019t stopped annoyingly waxing poetic about since I went for Mardi Gras as a college freshman. But it also had something to do with a photo of plump head-on shrimp skinny-dipping in a cast-iron pan full of Calabrian chile butter that I happened upon in 2016 while scrolling through Instagram. It was a thing of beauty, and it turned out to be the creation of this new chef who\u2019d just arrived in my favorite city from St. Lucia (by way of Miami) and opened a French-Caribbean restaurant called Comp\u00e8re Lapin.I didn\u2019t get a chance to actually taste Compton\u2019s food until last year\u2019s Southern Foodways Alliance symposium, where the chef somehow managed to pull off a near-perfect 350-person lunch. The cowheel soup she served\u2014made from real cowheels and cleverly tied to a Caribbean folktale about a beautiful man-killing woman, identifiable as an evil spirit only by her cow foot (I mean, come on)\u2014was the most delicious thing I ate in a weekend packed with delicious things. It was thick like velvet, with ginger and pumpkin and stewy lentils and habaneros rounding out the lush broth of roasted cow feet. I could\u2019ve bathed in the stuff. My vague crush became a full-blown obsession. Not like, starting-an-Instagram-fan-account-level obsession, but close.A few weeks later, by sheer coincidence, I found myself back in New Orleans, with time for only one unplanned meal. So, duh, I picked Bywater American Bistro, Compton\u2019s newest restaurant, a sophisticated celebration of local flavors and ingredients with nary a plastic beaded necklace in sight. There, I ate the dish that ended it all: a simple yet perfectly steamed red snapper blanketed in Crystal hot sauce-kissed Hollandaise. The sauce gets pumped through a whipped cream canister, making it so light and so fluffy that it resembles what I\u2019ve always thought clouds might taste like. And despite the fact that Compton and I had yet to speak a word to each other, it felt like the end of a rom-com, where everything falls into place and a jangly pop song starts to play. The credits roll and we all live happily ever after.Go there: Bywater American BistroExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsNew OrleansRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
