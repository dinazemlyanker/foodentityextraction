The aromatic blend consists of cilantro (or culantro, which grows wild on the island), garlic, onions, scallions, a source of acid, and a source of heat. For this recipe, the core components of green seasoning aren\u2019t pur\u00e9ed as they traditionally are but rather chopped by hand. Mild and mellow white fish\u2014in this case, cod\u2014is baked under this blanket of fresh herbs, and the end result is a simple yet comforting dish that also has bright bursts of tropical flavors and oomph. This is exactly the type of recipe I want during a very languid January.\u201dAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Someone asked about frozen cod, I used frozen cod and this is the perfect recipe because of the bright flavors. I used a whole habanero because half seemed too mild. I\u2019m in love. AnonymousFlorida 9/10/2021I made this tonight, it was okay, not amazing.  For whatever reason there was no real zing to the meal even when adding fresh lime when serving.  I'd suggest adding a little bit of soy sauce when serving. Naomi San Francisco, CA 1/18/2021Made this last night. I expected it to to be good, but it was delicious!! I made it with Mahi Mahi since they didn\u2019t have cod at my local grocery store. I also used finely chopped carrots instead of red pepper to stay seasonal for winter. Served over a salad. \n\nWould love to try it with cod as Mahi Mahi isn\u2019t my fave, but the flavors of the sauce and lime all together were wonderful. Printed this out to keep in the rotation. SarahAustin, TX1/12/2021This is SO delicious and easy. I had to leave out bell peppers and ginger because of an allergy issue so I just did extra onions and garlic (I love my aromatics). The herbaceous greens on top was simple and so good. I\u2019m obsessed, was just as good today out of my fridge. Growing ShortDallas, TX1/12/2021This looks delicious.  I am going to try it with BlackCod.   My answer to the question concerning the ginger.  I looked at the picture and think they used orange and red peppers to give the dish more color.   That much ginger would overpower everything else =.
