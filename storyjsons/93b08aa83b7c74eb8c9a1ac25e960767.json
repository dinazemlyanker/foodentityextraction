Whether they\u2019re filled with soup or coated in pesto, these round, squishy carbs trigger satisfied yawns and euphoric food comas. So why wouldn\u2019t Austria, lover of spaetzles and strudels, build an entire cuisine around them? In the German-speaking country, the locals refer to these supple handfuls of dough as kn\u00f6del (knuh-del). They may be sweet, cheesy or tangy, and in the small Alpine territory, flavors change from valley to pillowy valley. There\u2019s even a favorite kn\u00f6del depending on which corner of the country you\u2019re occupying. Knowing there are this many delicious dumplings at your fingertips, you\u2019ll be planning your trip to Austria before you finish the final paragraph. But first, get to know the lay of the land.Germkn\u00f6del in Arlberg\nGet Germkn\u00f6del in ArlbergPicture yourself mountain-side in the Austrian Alps, craving something delicious to satisfy you after a day-full of hiking. You\u2019re in Arlberg\u2013a soaring Massif in Western Austria\u2013and there\u2019s also a steaming yeast dumpling on your plate, topped with poppy seeds, sugar, and melted butter. A light prick of your fork into the germkn\u00f6del reveals warm plum jam inside bouncy dough. Arlbergians hike to Rud-Alpe or Ulmer H\u00fctte to order their sweet dumplings for lunch, dinner, dessert, or all of the above. Germkn\u00f6del are traditionally a treat for the snowy winter months, but if you call ahead, restaurants will make them on request.Speckkn\u00f6del \u00a9 \u00d6sterreich Werbung, Wolfgang Schardt\nSavor Speckkn\u00f6del in InnsbruckAustrians aren\u2019t shy about their love of quality meats. In outdoorsy Innsbruck, speck (smoked pork belly) goes in everything, including bread dumplings. Made from pieces of kaiser roll soaked in milk, speckkn\u00f6del taste like a hug that fills you up after a day in the Tirolean backcountry. Try them with a glass of schnaps at Gasthof Weisses R\u00f6ssl or Stiftskeller in historic Old Town. Unlike the syrupy liqueur you once discovered in your parent\u2019s liquor cabinet, schnaps is made from real Tirolean fruit and receives a careful distillation from one of the many local producers.Crave Kaspresskn\u00f6del in SalzburgerLandThe countryside around Salzburg claims the highest concentration of award-winning restaurants in Austria\u2014plus, there are nine themed \u201cculinary pathways\u201d to guide you to the best kitchens in the area. It\u2019s from this food Olympus that kaspresskn\u00f6del, or pressed cheese dumplings, first fell into a bowl of salty beef broth. They\u2019re made with local cheeses, like beer cheese or grassmilk cheese, and are fried in clarified butter. Some might prefer them with salad or just a creamy dipping sauce.Flying Chef in Austrian Airlines Business Class \u00a9 Austrian Airlines\nIf you travel for food, you know that every meal counts, which is why Austrian Airlines offers Business Class passengers multi-course menus served by their onboard Flying Chef.

The menu is inspired by Austrian staples, so you might even get a kn\u00f6del fix along the way.Apricot Dumplings \u00a9 \u00d6sterreich Werbung, Wolfgang Schardt\nMarvel Over Marillenkn\u00f6del in GrazApricot dumplings, or marillenkn\u00f6del, are Austria\u2019s most seasonal dumpling. In July and August, restaurants in Graz pit crates of perfectly ripe apricots, wrap them in quark cheese dough, boil them, and toss them in caramelized bread crumbs. The apricots hail from nearby mom-and-pop farms that earn Graz a reputation for exceptionally fresh, simple food. Austria has the largest percentage of organic farmland in the world, with 2079 organic producers in the province around Graz alone. You can sample the results at one of the city\u2019s open-air farmers\u2019 markets.Wherever you decide to stop on your Austrian food adventure, be sure to find a hotel that cares as much about great food as you do in the Austria Hotel Collection.
