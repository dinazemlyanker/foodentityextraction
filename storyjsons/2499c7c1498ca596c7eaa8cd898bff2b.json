My relationship with cooking the creamy cornmeal porridge has been nearly non-existent, mostly because I hate standing over the stove and stirring. It requires constant attention like a new puppy, and if I step away for one moment, it  clumps,  scorches\u2014or both. But after trying our new method for hands-off, no-stir oven-cooked polenta, I\u2019m ready to add it to my weekly fall cooking lineup.The beauty is in the technique\u2019s ideal ratio of minimal effort to maximum payoff, resulting in a bowl of cheesy, creamy, comforting goodness you barely have to work for. The polenta starts in a saucepan or Dutch oven on the stove, just to bring everything to a boil, then gets covered and slid into the oven alongside a pan full of mushrooms already roasting away. And here\u2019s where the magic comes in: The oven does the work of evenly distributing the heat for you, meaning you don't need to put in a full-on arm day of stirring and sweating to temper the intense, single-direction flame of a burner. All it takes is a brisk whisk and a hefty handful of grated Parmesan cheese at the end to bring it to its optimal smooth, thick consistency. (Add a little extra butter or heavy cream if you want to gild the lily. Or up the Parm and fresh black pepper, to make it a Cacio e Pepe polenta!)Crispy mushrooms are a great topper, but you could go with any roasted vegetable or protein you\u2019re into.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Sue LiWith sweet summer corn season now over, it's the perfect time to adopt a new style of corn to eat on repeat\u2014especially when you consider how damn good and versatile it is as leftovers. It\u2019s perfect for breakfast when I get sick of oatmeal or grits\u2014I just whisk in a little milk or water during the reheat and top with a fried egg. And, I can repurpose it for the next night\u2019s dinner: spread it out on a plate, chill it, cut it into squares, and pan-fry it into crispy goodness, topped with chicken pot pie filling or a hearty tomato sauce. The best part is that there are no more polenta-stirring marathons in sight. I guess this means I should find a new arm workout.Get the recipe:Oven Polenta with Roasted Mushrooms and ThymeCall it cheating\u2014we call it 30 minutes you don\u2019t need to spend standing at the stove.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titMushroomPolentaRoasted VegetablesRead MorecookingTriple Corn Polenta: An Elaborate Dish That Didn\u2019t Need to Exist, Until It DidBy Amiel StanekcookingMake This Miso Polenta with Your First Spring Farmers' Market HaulBy Chris MoroccocookingWhat Is the Difference Between Grits and Polenta?By Alex DelanyInstant Pot Polenta Cacio e PepeRecipes you want to make.
