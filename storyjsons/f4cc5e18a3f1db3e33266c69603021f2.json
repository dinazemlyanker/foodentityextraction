Wait, have you heard that one before? Or maybe you\u2019ve even thought that as you scanned the room wondering: Is there enough toilet paper? Is the seat clean? Is the soap dispenser full?But the ante has been upped. Restaurants are not only are offering cleaner and well stocked bathrooms, but ones that are also experiences unto themselves, separate from the meal. There might be colorful wallpaper to snap a selfie in front of, Aesop soap you can lather with two greedy pumps, and a playlist loaded with LCD Soundsystem. A probable feature in this new-wave bathroom: a Toto toilet.The Toto has a range of features you never thought your toilet needed: heated seats, a remote control bidet (with adjustments for water pressure), a lid that automatically raises when you enter the bathroom, and a deodorizer that neutralizes any unpleasant scents after your visit. In Japan, where Toto was founded, the Toto brand is the norm in many houses and businesses. In the U.S. it\u2019s lately become an obsession of high-end restaurants both Japanese and non-Japanese. We\u2019ve seen it at N/Naka in Los Angeles, Odo in New York, the Green Pheasant in Nashville, SingleThread Farms in Healdsburg, CA, and Maison Yaki in Brooklyn. In these restaurants, it has become an integral part of providing high-level hospitality, born from a desire to indulge in the bathroom experience rather than treat it as a reluctant, practical necessity.In 1917, Kazuchika Okura founded the Toto company, though its fancy technology didn\u2019t come until 1980, when the brand introduced the \u201cwashlet,\u201d a toilet that offered an electronic bidet and a heated seat. By the late \u201980s these mechanized toilets had become a cultural phenomenon in Japan, a perfect fit for the country\u2019s hyper-organized, technology-obsessed society, in which a long bath is a nightly activity. Toto toilets became commonplace, even in shopping centers and schools.In 1990, Toto toilets made it to the U.S. The company thought they would be an intriguing novelty to American consumers, explains Bill Strang, the president of operations at Toto USA. These days the U.S. makes up 8 to 9 percent of Toto\u2019s global business. The majority of sales are to homes and hotels, Strang says, but restaurants are one of the most important markets: That\u2019s where most customers first encounter the warm embrace of a Toto toilet seat.The earliest adopters in the U.S., as you might guess, were Japanese restaurants. Sakagura, a restaurant in New York, has been using Toto toilets since it opened in 1996. With a company motto that states, \u201cEnjoy Japan without the airfare,\u201d owner Bon Yagi says he felt a Toto toilet was essential. \u201cIt was only natural for our restaurant group to extend our \u2018Japan experience\u2019 in the bathroom as well.\u201dIt\u2019s worth mentioning that these toilets aren\u2019t cheap. The higher-end models can run you $13,000 (they include \u201cbacteria-neutralizing ultraviolet light\u201d and a \u201ctitanium dioxide\u2013fired toilet bowl\u201d). In a business where owners are operating on razor-thin margins, a Toto is an investment. But its restaurateur adherents say it is worth the cost.\u201cWe have a small restaurant with no crazy artwork on the wall or ten-thousand-dollar chairs,\u201d says Will Aghajanian, an owner of the tasting menu restaurant, the Catbird Seat, in Nashville. He thought the Toto would leave a more personal impression in a city where every restaurant seems to have \u201cthe same bathroom with the Aesop soap stuck on the wall,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is weird to talk about toilets, but these are just luxurious.\u201dSatoru Yasumatsu, a partner at Japanese restaurant Odo, says he and many Japanese people \u201ccannot live without a Toto toilet.\u201d\u201cIn Japan everywhere is clean, like the streets and inside buildings,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is especially true for restaurants. If the bathroom is dirty, the entire dining experience is ruined.\u201d\u201cJapanese people are always trying to consider an overall feeling,\u201d says Niki Nakayama, the chef and owner of N/Naka. Her restaurant has two Toto toilets, the model with the seat that automatically opens and closes as if by premonition, and Nakayama also has them installed in her home. \u201cWhen Toto toilets were introduced, it felt like a discreet way to show a sign of respect and comfort.\u201dEvery chef and restaurateur I talked to said guests go out of their way to comment on the toilet during or after their meal. Most are positive. Some get confused with all the buttons and options. Aghajanian and Nakayama have had instances where people forget to turn off the bidet, causing a miniature water show. But the general feedback harkens back to the reason this toilet became such a sensation in the first place: After using a Toto, why would I conduct my business anywhere else?\u201cI am always a little bit thrilled by a Toto,\u201d says Hannah Goldfield, the food critic for the New Yorker, \u201cespecially if the seat is heated and it is cold outside.\u201dShe almost never mentions the bathroom in a review, but she made an exception in a devastating write-up of the restaurant Zauo, where diners fish for their dinner: \u201cIf Zauo has one redeeming quality, besides a cheerful and accommodating staff, it\u2019s the bathrooms. There are water tanks here, too\u2014atop beautiful Toto toilets, with blissfully heated seats.\u201dA Toto may never become the norm for American restaurants in the way that it is in Japan. It\u2019s harder for restaurateurs here to justify spending their limited capital on an expensive single product that\u2019s not directly related to the food.But for those who are lucky enough to encounter one: welcome to your new life, where the toilet seats are always warm and the bidet is perfectly pressured. Just be prepared for an extra long wait in line for the bathroom.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHot 10 2019RestaurantsTrendsRead MorerestaurantsThis Restaurant Stocks Their Bathroom with Homemade Altoids (And They're Amazing)By Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
