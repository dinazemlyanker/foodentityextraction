Arms wrapped tightly around his suitcase, he prayed guard dogs wouldn\u2019t pick up the pungent smell of the fermented locust bean cakes stuffed between toiletries and bundled shirts in his luggage. If Thiam had wrapped the beans in enough aluminum foil, the dogs would keep moving. But if they stopped to sniff for a moment too long, he knew security would empty his bag and send him back to New York empty-handed as they had many times before.\u201cThere was no other choice,\u201d the chef says. Without locust beans, bitter eggplant, tiny blond fonio grains, and the other Senegalese ingredients he hid in his carry-on, he couldn\u2019t make any of the dishes on his menu.The memory, now two decades old, stands in stark contrast to where he sits now, one long skinny leg crossed over the other at his eight-month-old Harlem restaurant, Teranga, and at the head of his own food-importing operation, Yol\u00e9l\u00e9. But he likely wouldn\u2019t be where he is had the obstacles been different. If getting his ingredients from West Africa to Brooklyn were easier. If rising rents hadn\u2019t forced the closing his restaurant, Le Grand Dakar, in Clinton Hill in 2011. If he hadn\u2019t already been so exhausted from years cooking fine-dining cuisine.The idea for the businesses Thiam now runs began taking shape while he traveled throughout Senegal as part of a post-restaurant-closure research trip. If he started a sourcing company, he could build a bridge between Africa and America so that chefs no longer had to hide bags of grain and fillets of dried fish in their bags, and African farmers could find a new market for their goods. Back in New York, he would bring these ingredients to grocery stores for home cooks to use and to open a new restaurant where he could share them with diners. \u201cBringing the spices and the seasonings and the flavors of Africa to America, that was the vision,\u201d Thiam says.At Teranga, fonio is made into jollof with green peas, and a salad with beets, pickled carrots, and pomegranate.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanBy 2017, he had set up relationships with several farming collectives in West Africa to launch Yol\u00e9l\u00e9 and bring its first product to the U.S. market: the highly nutritious African grain fonio. A staple in West Africa, fonio is everywhere. Cooks blanket the fluffy steamed grain in sweet, creamy peanut sauce; dot it with herbs and vegetables; and adorn it with braised lamb so tender the meat practically melts into the absorbent pearls. It\u2019s cooked into breakfast porridges, covered in stew for lunch, and mixed with greens at dinnertime.In a changing climate, fonio is a stable source of sustenance and income, a crop that resists drought and harsh weather, unlike the others so many West African farmers began growing after colonial powers brought corn, peanuts, and cotton to the region. But it also grows more slowly and isn\u2019t in the same demand internationally\u2014yet. \u201cThe farmers that grow fonio are in dire need of income,\u201d Thiam tells me. \u201cThey barely survive because there\u2019s no market for it.\u201dWith Yol\u00e9l\u00e9 Foods (cofounded with food industry veteran Philip Teverow), Thiam wanted to show Americans that the grain could be just as exciting as any other ingredient New York chefs were cooking with, while also creating an outlet for West African farmers to sell their harvests. Two years in, his plan already seems to be working.Fonio imported by Thiam first appeared in Whole Foods Markets across New York City in 2017, and it will be more widely available in locations throughout the Northeast later this year. It\u2019s also showing up at restaurants featuring non-African menus. At Dime\u2019s, a breezy California-inspired spot in Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side, chef Alissa Wagner has incorporated fonio into a sweet porridge, a savory grain salad, and her take on shrimp and grits. At the Dining Room at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, fonio is part of a fluffy pilaf served alongside creamed nettles, rhubarb, and a thick slice of blush-pink duck. \u201cChef Pierre\u2019s idea to [support this grain\u2019s production] in an area that is being decimated by climate change\u2014it's a stroke of genius,\u201d Fred Sabo, the restaurant\u2019s executive chef, says. Wagner expresses a similar sentiment: \u201cFonio is quick-cooking and easy to prepare, plus it\u2019s gluten-free, which is an added bonus. I especially love that by using fonio at the restaurant, we are helping to support a community of West African farmers.\u201dThe counter at Teranga.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanWith Yol\u00e9l\u00e9 up and running, Thiam felt ready to open the restaurant he had envisioned while traveling through Senegal. In February 2019, eight years after his last New York brick-and-mortar shuttered, he and social entrepreneur Noah Levine launched Teranga in the Africa Center in Harlem. The Wolof word teranga translates loosely to \u201chospitality,\u201d though Thiam insists the meaning is much deeper, a foundational value in Senegalese culture. \u201cOpening another restaurant was always in the back of my mind,\u201d Thiam says, \u201cbut I knew I wanted to take the time to think it through\u2014to not fall into the same pitfalls that I encountered with the other restaurants. I didn\u2019t want such a difficult life.\u201dUnlike any of the chef\u2019s past ventures, Teranga follows a fast-casual format: Premade dishes are displayed in colorful Dutch ovens behind a counter, ready to be assembled into customizable grain bowls and market plates. The dishes are a nod to the food that women in Thiam\u2019s family made during his childhood: ndambe, a rich, comforting sweet-potato-and-black-eyed-pea stew brightened with rounds of crisp okra; egusi, a deep-orange stew of hearty greens made bitter by ground melon seeds; and tomato-based jollof made, of course, with fonio. \u201cI have been living in New York for quite some time now,\u201d Thiam says, \u201cand I think Teranga was missing.\u201dThe chef is in a very different position now than when he opened Le Grand Dakar 15 years ago, working endless shifts, hoping his ingredients wouldn\u2019t be confiscated en route to America. He has become an ambassador for West African cuisine and a guide for any American who wishes to cook it. Thiam now dedicates as much time\u2014if not more\u2014to introducing African produce to other restaurants as he does to cooking it at his own. \u201cI see so much opportunity for African food culture in general to just explode in New York,\u201d he says, his eyes twinkling. \u201cThis is just scratching the surface.\u201dThiam, in green, with his team.\nHe\u2019s preparing to launch new menu items at Teranga later this fall, developing recipes inspired by his travels in Senegal. He\u2019ll teach the cooks to re-create these dishes so that when he\u2019s abroad, the restaurant will continue to serve the food his customers have come to love. \u201cI still experience fine dining as much as I can when I travel, but I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not the guy in that kitchen at the moment,\u201d Thiam says. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything is more rewarding than the type of cooking I\u2019m doing now\u2014the cooking that was directly inspired by my foremothers.\u201dIn November, he\u2019ll publish his third cookbook, this one entirely dedicated to fonio. He\u2019s already thinking of ways to build out Teranga by opening more locations of the restaurant to further share his vision with American diners. And, he\u2019s got a line of fonio chips in the works. Through Yol\u00e9l\u00e9, Thiam hopes to roll out other African-grown ingredients like atti\u00e9k\u00e9, granules of fermented cassava pulp nearly identical in appearance to couscous; bambara beans; nutrient-packed moringa leaves; and the very same fermented locust beans Thiam used to have to conceal in aluminum foil.\u201cAt first, I had to smuggle African ingredients in my luggage,\u201d Thiam remembers, laughing. \u201cNow, I bring them in shipping containers.\u201dBuy It: Yol\u00e9l\u00e9 Fonio (pack of 3 bags), $20 on AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
