We recommend serving it with a simply dressed salad for the adults: Bitter greens and a bright acidic vinaigrette will be an ideal counterpart to all that cheesy goodness.Ingredients4 servings\u00bdtsp. kosher salt, plus more10oz. baby spinach114-oz. can artichoke hearts1large garlic clove, finely chopped2oz. Parmesan, finely grated (about \u00bd cup)2Tbsp. mayonnaiseJuice of \u00bd lemonDash or 2 of hot sauceFreshly ground black pepper2oz. chilled cream cheese, cut into \u00bd\" pieces4\u00bd\"-thick slices country-style bread (such as sourdough)Extra-virgin olive oil (for drizzling)6slices provolone cheesePreparationStep 1Heat broiler. Bring \u00bd cup water and a large pinch of salt to a simmer in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add spinach, a fistful at a time, letting it wilt slightly before adding more and using tongs or a heatproof rubber spatula to toss as you go. Continue to cook, tossing occasionally, until all of the spinach is wilted, about 2 minutes. Drain and let cool slightly, then squeeze out as much liquid as you can.Step 2Drain artichoke hearts and press out as much liquid as you can. Coarsely chop artichoke hearts and spinach and place in a large bowl. Add garlic, Parmesan, mayonnaise, lemon juice, hot sauce, and \u00bd tsp. salt and mix well; season with pepper. Gently mix in cream cheese, taking care not to fully break up pieces. Taste and season with more salt if needed.Step 3Arrange slices of bread on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and broil until lightly toasted, about 1 minute per side. Drizzle 1 side of each toast with oil and spoon spinach mixture on top, packing it on and taking care to cover edges so they don\u2019t burn. Cut 2 slices of cheese in half. Place a slice and a half of cheese on top of each toast, arranging so that spinach mixture is covered.Step 4Broil toasts until cheese is melted and browned in spots, about 2 minutes (keep a watchful eye on toasts as no two broilers are the same and you don\u2019t want the toasts to burn).How would you rate Spinach and Artichoke Melts?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (4)Back to TopTriangleVery yummy, but quite rich with all that cheese & mayo. Would go out of my way to make again.CallieOregon6/29/2021This is easy to make and is absolutely scrumptious!  Everyone in my family loves it!\nThanks Deb for another winner!!Debra HannahKansas City2/19/2021This is a really fun way to make lunch more exciting, and super easy to make (a tiny bit messy, but not too bad). I used double the amount of garlic, next time I\u2019ll probably use even more than that, and I recommend more provolone per sandwich. I also did not use nearly as much spinach because I thought it seemed excessive and that instinct turned out to be correct. The lemon really does brighten it up. I love this recipe, it\u2019s going to be a great app to serve to vegetarian friends at parties (remember parties?) when sliced into individual bite sized pieces.AnonymousOmaha, NE11/12/2020Love the idea!  I added a bunch of things so can't honestly review the original... but again I LOVE the idea and will be making again! Added the ingredients I usually add to the dip version - a bit of sour cream, onion, Worcestershire sauce, dijon mustard and fresh basil.  Next time I'll cut the cream cheese cubes a bit smaller, but otherwise, it was delicious!  The lemon added a nice bit of brightness and the provolone was a melty wonderful additionAnonymousLos Angeles, CA6/24/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSandwichProvoloneCheeseSpinachLeafy GreensVegetableArtichokeWeeknight MealsMainSnackNut-FreeVegetarianBroilLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
