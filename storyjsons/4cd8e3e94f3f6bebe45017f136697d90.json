Two hours later, I\u2019d counted 152 more crystals in the hotel: 120 marble-size, milky orbs were neatly nestled in the cabinet behind the check-in desk, 26 dotted the entrance of the wellness center, complete with an infrared sauna and Reiki, art-making, and life-coaching sessions. I spotted another three in the beautiful yoga studio as I was folded into downward dog with streams of sweat pooling on the yoga mat. In the hallway to my room, there was a black and white rock that looked like a R2D2-sized musubi. And then there was the very large pink one on the bedside table of my dreamy, cabin-like room that seemed straight out of Moonrise Kingdom.If you couldn\u2019t tell, Eaton DC isn\u2019t like other hotels. It's the second outpost of the Eaton chain\u2014the first is in Hong Kong with more U.S. locations opening up in the future.  In addition to the crystals and the wellness center at the DC hotel, there\u2019s a mini theater showing films like \u201cI\u2019m Not Racist\u2026 Am I?\u201d. There\u2019s a radio station that hosts shows like \u201cRisky Behavior,\u201d which breaks down wellness trends (CBD!). There\u2019s a \u201cradical\u201d library where you can check out books like Multiplication Is For White People. The hotel hosts book talks\u2014the rapper Common (!!) swung by to discuss his new work, Let Love Have the Last Word: A Memoir\u2014and conversations with poets like Cleo Wade and activists like DeRay Mckesson.\u201cOur hotel is about making the world a better place and creating conditions for people to be their best selves,\u201d Katherine Lo, Eaton DC\u2019s founder, told me over the phone after my stay. She wanted to build a hotel that wasn\u2019t just focused on hospitality and luxury but also on activism, wellness, and art\u2014things that hotels typically don\u2019t care about. Lo, 37, was a filmmaker and activist in college and is the daughter of a famed hotelier in Hong Kong. She\u2019s frank about what she\u2019s doing: funneling her family\u2019s vast resources into artists, issues, causes, and organizations that matter to her. \u201cI\u2019m using a for-profit model to achieve the same goals as an activist,\u201d Lo explained. \u201cAnd the main thing we can provide is space.\u201dThat means using the hotel lobby for installations (conceptual artist Mel Chin\u2019s Fundred project about the Flint water crisis was on show when I was there), inviting artists to stay at the hotel for residencies (photographer Ayana V. Jackson was the first), stocking the mini bar with Flow water instead of Boxed water since Betsy DeVos, the Trump-appointed Secretary of Education, is associated with the latter, and hosting an opening reception for American University\u2019s first annual Antiracist Book Festival, which was happening during my stay. When I first asked about it at the crystal-covered front desk, no one seemed to know that it was happening. The second time I inquired, I was told it was a ticketed event and not open to the public.Eaton's wellness programming ranges from sunlight yoga to candlelit crystal gong baths.\nPhoto by Jennifer HughesAlongside its activism-focused programming, Eaton DC has the requisite coffee shop (Kintsugi), a quietly ambitious restaurant from local chef Tim Ma (American Son), and not one but two bars (Allegory hidden behind the radical library and Wild Days on the rooftop).When I met him at American Son, Ma explained the story behind the name, how his immigrant mother introduced him to her friends as her \u201cAmerican Son\u201d as a way to indicate that he couldn\u2019t converse in Chinese with them. His hyphenated identity courses through the menu: the pillowiest gnocchi is made, somehow, with tofu, and there\u2019s a clever take on ssam with spaghetti squash, served with big leafy lettuces, tons of little sauces, and crunchy toppings. There\u2019s also a big-ass, bone-in ribeye with chimichurri and smashed potatoes that reminds you this is still a hotel restaurant, a.k.a. one that can pamper its well-paying guests.I couldn\u2019t really shake off a pervading thought: At Eaton DC, activism is the selling point.Of course I enjoyed the steak. And the velvety booth I sat in designed by hot-hot restaurant designers Parts and Labor. And the heavenly Plushbed mattress I slumped into later that night in my room that usually books for $200 a night (rooms range from around $140 to $350 a night). But in the end, I couldn\u2019t really shake off a pervading thought: At Eaton DC, activism is the selling point. It felt a little icky to me, this idea that social issues can be marketing tools\u2014as if paying for a hotel can solve entrenched problems like racism, sexism, and the like.Eaton DC is hardly the only lifestyle brand that\u2019s grafted social justice into its marketing campaigns. From Dove\u2019s body-positive, diversity-focused \u201cReal Beauty\u201d campaign to Nike naming Colin Kaepernick as its athlete of the year to Gillette\u2019s toxic masculinity commercial in the wake of #MeToo, brands are all about appearing radical and inclusive. But their ultimate goal, of course, is profit. And I\u2019ve always believed that activism and capitalism have opposing bottom lines. After seeing Patagonia go after Trump on climate change, you feel better about buying its outdoor goods. You can freely use Lyft, knowing that the ridesharing company now covers $200 of a name-changing fee for its transgender drivers. But all this signaling through advertising doesn\u2019t equate to meaningful action or accountability on these issues. If consumers stopped caring about a problem like, say, climate change, these companies would find a different message to sell us the same stuff.Here, Himalayan salt lamps are standard bedside table fare.\nPhoto by Adrian GautWhen I asked Lo how she\u2019s able to reconcile social justice with commercial enterprise, she didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cI think that there are benefits to merging them because we\u2019re hoping to create a seamless financial model where the company operates with revenue but goes back to support social impact, cultural, and media programs,\u201d she said. \u201cGuests can come and know that by patronizing this they are supporting art and social change.\u201dFor activists in the DC area, this seems to ring true. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see corporations adopt a mindful and inclusive business model,\u201d Amanda Nguyen told me over the phone. She walks by the hotel all the time\u2014she lives nearby\u2014and is the founder of Rise, an organization that fights for the rights of sexual assault survivors. She\u2019s even hoping that she can work with Eaton DC in the future. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for some creatives to get venue space for a talk or a book reading,\u201d explained Christine Platt, an activist, author, and previously the managing director of the Antiracist Center at American University (which put on the Antiracist Book Festival). \u201cI\u2019m not going to make a lot of money doing those things.\u201d Eaton DC partnered with her for the festival, she told me, and offered discounted rooms for the authors and speakers (usually rooms range between $180 and $270 a night). Now she\u2019s there probably once a week, taking meetings and inevitably running into someone else she knows. \u201cThe only place we had before Eaton was [the cafe known as a hub for grassroots organizing] Busboys and Poets,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very much open to the community, where artists, writers, and activists can sit and work for hours even if you only ordered one cup of coffee. I feel like Eaton has become like that in a short amount of time.\u201dHearing all this, I wondered if I was being puritanical in my own thinking. Nguyen and Platt seemed fine collaborating with a for-profit company on their endeavors\u2014in fact, they were even more enthusiastic because of the opportunities and resources that came with it. Was I naive to think that social justice work could only be effective outside of a capitalist setting? Should I be more cynical, realizing that the lines between activism and capitalism are already so blurred? Here at Eaton DC, you can support art that reminds you of what is (still) going on in Flint, Michigan, and drink Betsy DeVos-free water, and eat a $125 steak all in one go. Is there a problem with that?\u201cContinue to grapple,\u201d Platt told me when I shared my confusion. \u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019ll find a lot of the answers.\u201dThe next morning, I waited for a much-needed latte at Kintsugi and headed up to the rooftop with Ma, where he showed me Wild Days and the beds of aji charapita peppers and lemon verbena just planted for the restaurant. Ma looked down K Street, the epicenter of lobbyist gatherings, from our perch. \u201cFrom the anti-Trump hotel you can see the Trump hotel,\u201d he pointed out with amusement. About 12 hours later, after a round of makrut lime leaf cocktails at Allegory, we ended up at the rooftop again, but the vibe was much different from last time we were there: the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner had just ended and people were ready to party. A suited media bro unleashed his belt for a little limbo, and everyone joined in until a bouncer cut off the game. The DJ is coming on, she said. Downstairs, business travelers were ordering that steak dinner, but up here the writers, activists, and artists were cutting loose.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishWashington, D.C.HotelsTrendsRead MoreLifestyleI Tried 'Wellness Coworking' and It Made Me Feel Profoundly AloneBy Rachel Sugar Recipes you want to make.
