You could be that happy!By Alex BeggsMay 20, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto Courtesy of Jet's PizzaFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.\u201cDON\u2019T FORGET THE SIDE BOTTLE OF RANCH!\u201dJet\u2019s Pizza is a Michigan-born chain with stores across the country, known for its variety of flavored crusts (why would you get anything other than TURBO I don\u2019t even know), side orders of breads that are just pizza sliced into sticks, and buttery, mathematically masterful eight-corner Detroit-style pies (the move). Every slice is a crispy-edged corner. Every slice is perfect. After the Detroit Tigers\u2019 opening day last year when sports still existed, we had a huge family gathering, tables covered in grease-stained Jet\u2019s boxes. And among them: a full squeeze bottle of Jet\u2019s ranch dressing. That\u2019ll be $4, and worth every penny.It might be Hidden Valley mix for all I know. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m from the religious upbringing of dipping pizza into ranch dressing and either you\u2019re with me or you\u2019re not\u2014that\u2019s a right bestowed upon us by the American constitution. In fuzzy-lensed memories of my youth, slightly sunburned lifeguards sit around a table with a shared plate full of ranch in the center for communal dipping. MEMORIES. Shared ranch plates, though, are a thing of the germ-ridden past.Which is good news for the squeeze bottle. Just squeeze a puddle of ranch on the upper quadrant of your plate and replenish as needed. The little plastic side containers aren\u2019t big enough for a family, which is any group of people over one. Leftovers? You\u2019ve got ranch for every salad and every piece of roasted broccoli in your foreseeable future. Or, as Jet\u2019s own Facebook pages suggest, use it as toothpaste. Once it\u2019s used up, you\u2019ve got a cute little squeeze bottle with a cheerful round-faced man jetting off into space to refill with simple syrup, or whatever.I was recently in Traverse City, Michigan, quarantining for two contactless weeks with my guy and one night, we ordered Jet\u2019s. We needed Jet\u2019s! When we asked the employee on the phone to leave the pizza on the porch because we were self-isolating, he replied enthusiastically in the voice of a Midwestern Lebowski, \u201cThat sounds RAD, man!\u201d Then he said something about how he\u2019d seen videos of people fighting over milk (??okay??). \u201cOh, and a squeeze bottle of ranch, please!\u201d we chimed in. Can\u2019t forget.Order it: Find a Jet\u2019s location near you.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendPizzaRead Moreculture8 Styles of Regional Pizza to Know, Love, and CherishBy Arthur BovinorestaurantsI Go to Dearborn, Michigan, Just For This LunchBy Alex DelanycultureThe Frozen Pizza That Won Over This Pizza SnobBy Adam RapoportRecipes you want to make.
