Meet them all here.Hanahana Beauty isn\u2019t just any skincare company, and Abena Boamah-Acheampong isn\u2019t just any CEO. The 27-year-old former algebra teacher sources shea butter directly from female producers in Ghana to create the all-natural, silky smooth balms getting us through winter and beyond.Last summer, Abena Boamah-Acheampong was on a trip to Ghana\u2019s northern city of Tamale when she met a collective of women producing shea butter from the seeds of native shea bushes. Most shea butter in Ghana is sold at local markets or to middle men who sell to large distributors overseas. \u201cThis group of women were so passionate about what they were doing, but they weren\u2019t seeing the value they deserved,\u201d says Boamah-Acheampong. After that trip, the 27-year-old returned to Chicago and founded the skincare brand Hanahana Beauty, using shea butter sourced from the same collective in Ghana. Here, the very busy entrepreneur describes what a perfect day looks like, the most important lesson she\u2019s learned from starting a business, and who\u2019d attend her dinner party (hint: Solange is a guest).I got the name Hanahana... my dad after I told him I was thinking about turning my love for making beauty products into a business. It\u2019s actually a Twi (a dialect of the Akan language spoken in southern and central Ghana) word that means \u201csomething smooth and malleable.\u201dI\u2019m obsessed with skin care products because\u2026 they\u2019re pure energy. They\u2019re absorbed directly into your skin, which is why I\u2019m super intentional about making Hanahana\u2019s with lots of love, care, and good energy.The most important lesson I\u2019ve learned is... to listen. In my personal life and with my business I strive for growth, and the only way I can do that is to listen to those around me, and to be super intentional about what I\u2019m doing.People tend to forget that wellness means... not just the physical things you\u2019re putting on and in your body but also being conscious of who you surround yourself with, what you put into your mind, and what you\u2019re putting out into the world.The perfect day starts with... waking up without my phone, running by the water, praying, meditating, reading my devotional, then having a fresh juice.Being a middle school algebra teacher taught me\u2026 the power of taking care of myself. Unless I\u2019m doing the things that make me feel well, I can\u2019t have the impact that I truly want to have on the world.My goal for Hanahana Beauty is to\u2026 ensure Black women understand that these products were made with them in mind. So often, we aren\u2019t thought about in the beauty industry, so it\u2019s imperative they understand that we consider everything from our ingredient selection to our marketing with them in mind.Three products you\u2019ll always find in my purse are\u2026 Hanahana's Shea Butter, Glossier\u2019s Lip Gloss, and some form of rose water.My dream dinner party\u2026would include Solange, my mom, Ms. Tina (Solange\u2019s mom), Beyonc\u00e9, my Godmother, and Deun Ivory (fellow creative and friend), where we would dine on banku, okra stew, and jollof rice.Explore Bon App\u00e9titPerson of InterestprofileHealthyishRead MoreshoppingThese Photos Show the Women Behind the Shea Butter in Your Beauty ProductsGallery5 SlidesBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
