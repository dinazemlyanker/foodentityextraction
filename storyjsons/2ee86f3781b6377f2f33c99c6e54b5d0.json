So when he was invited to pop up at his friend Eric See\u2019s Brooklyn restaurant, Ursula, he knew he had to do a waffle. This recipe is inspired by bibingka, a Filipino cake generally made with glutinous rice flour that his mother would make for breakfast on special occasions. This rice flour is the secret to these waffles\u2019 delightful chew. Top them with fresh fruit, toasted coconut flakes, and coconut yogurt to keep them vegan and gluten-free.Standard and Belgian waffle makers will work for this recipe.

They barely rise so one side didn\u2019t cook as well on my stovetop waffle iron, but they are delicious! I didn\u2019t have problems with sticking.ChunkStyle 12/19/2021Chewy, crispy, delicious! I didn\u2019t have club soda on hand, so used sparking water instead.  Also subbed in toasted sesame seeds for the coconut flakes.  I buttered the waffle iron, and waffles were crispy and golden!  No issues with releasing.  Will definitely make again! AnonymousSan Francisco11/27/2021I used a nonstick waffle iron (nothing has ever stuck to it) and greased with coconut oil anyhow.  The waffles stuck thoroughly.  I was able to salvage enough of the first batch, in pieces, for he two of us to eat.  It was delicious, with a wonderful texture.  I cleaned the waffle iron and greased it again, but the second batch was not even slightly salvageable.  Now I\u2019m left  wondering how I\u2019m going to get this mess out of my electric waffle maker.  I might make this again, but as pancakes.Jeanne Idaho10/24/2021Made these this morning.
