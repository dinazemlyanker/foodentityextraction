While your chicken is getting toasty in the oven, make your chile crisp-inspired dressing with garlic, paprika, cracked coriander, and red pepper flakes. If you have leftovers (or want to make extra for a bit of meal prep), keep all of your ingredients separate in the fridge so that they stay fresher for longer. \u00a0This recipe is part of the 2021\u00a0Feel Good Food Plan, our eight-day dinner plan for starting the year off right.Ingredients4 servings3skin-on, bone-in chicken breasts\u00a0 (about 1\u00bd lb. total)Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper2Tbsp. plus \u2153 cup extra-virgin olive oil3garlic cloves, thinly sliced2tsp. paprika1tsp. coriander seeds, coarsely\u00a0crushed\u00bdtsp. crushed red pepper flakes2medium endive, leaves separated1large head of radicchio, leaves\u00a0 separated, torn if large4satsumas or blood oranges or 3 medium oranges, peeled, sliced into rounds, seeds removed2Tbsp. white wine vinegar or red wine vinegar2tsp. toasted sesame seeds, lightly crushedPreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 450\u00b0.

Combined all ingredients and topped it off w honey pecans, .Wonderful.with regular oranges!DorothySan Francisco.3/2/2021Really good. The combination of garlic, paprika and coriander has an unexpectedly delicious emergent flavor. I\u2019ve never cooked chicken like this, but I absolutely would again. It ends up much juicier than boneless skinless chicken breast, and I also feel like it\u2019s harder to overlook it this way. I couldn\u2019t find endives but subbed about 1/8 of a cabbage instead. I mixed blood oranges and satsumas, and add a handful of quartered deseeded kumquats. Would recommend. AnonymousSan Francisco, CA2/9/2021I made the recipe almost as written. After the suggestions on the Tamarind Chicken to use a roasting pan in the oven, I just cooked the chicken entirely in the oven. I roasted it at 450 for 20 minutes and another five at 425. My oven seems to require a little more time than most recipes call for. Anyway, I love, love, love the flavors! We had blood oranges, which are really sweet this year. They helped the radicchio and endive. The chili oil is sublime. I will definitely use it on other things. This goes into the regular rotation!AnonymousSan Francisco, CA1/23/2021I really wanted to love this recipe. After reading the few reviews I see that other modified the recipe. I made it as the recipe states and felt it fell short. AnonymousSeattle, wa1/13/2021This is the best recipe of the bunch so far. The chicken was delicious! We made it with red cabbage and leftover collards from the chicken dish instead of radicchio and endive (it's just unbearably bitter). But the garlic oil and everything else about it were just scrumptious! Anonymousnyc, ny1/8/2021Pretty tasty. I would slice the raddichio, endives, and oranges finer, to better distribute the sweet bits with the bitterness.MegVancouver 1/6/2021Great winter recipe. To balance the bitter, I put honey in the dressingKD1/5/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladChicken BreastChickenPoultryCitrusFruitEasyWeeknight MealsMainGluten-FreeDairy-FreeHealthyishDinnerRecipes you want to make.
