We'd all sleep eight hours a night, hydrate regularly, and spend 90% less time comparing ourselves to the rich and famous on Instagram. And we'd all be using Y-peelers.It's a genuine mystery to me why so many of us are still using swivel peelers\u2014or worse yet, paring knives\u2014when the alternative is not only cheap and easy-to-use but also the preferred standard in professional kitchens across the country. But like I said, humans don't always get it right. There's no better time to rethink your peeling approach than winter, when the seasonal produce\u2014from carrots to squash to sweet potatoes\u2014is all so peeler-friendly.I suppose you'll be wanting some evidence to back up these claims of the Y-peeler's greatness. Well, for starters, you can buy a pack of three for under $10 on Amazon (and at these prices, just toss 'em when they get dull and move onto the next). Then, consider the grip. With a swivel peeler, you're forced into an awkward, elbows-out stance, where the rotating blade always seems to swivel away from where you need it to go. With a Y-peeler's ergonomic design, you can comfortably hold whatever needs to be peeled\u2014be it a cucumber, a mango, a kiwi, an eggplant, a potato, or a carrot\u2014in one hand, and pull the peeler down from below with the other in one swift, fluid motion. No carpal tunnel. No nicks and cuts. No sloppy, jagged peels.\"Simplicity is the key to brilliance.\" \u2014Bruce Lee, about this Y-peeler, we assume.\nFor the fancy chefs among us, there's a Y-peeler for every occasion. We're fans of this Tovolo three-pack ($12 on Amazon), which includes one regular peeler, one for julienning, and one with a serrated blade to dig into fruits and veggies with delicate skins. With these (magnetic! stackable!) bad boys in your kitchen drawer, you can shred green papaya for a Thai salad, peel potatoes for mashing, or even zest a lemon for a drink.Of course, there are a few peeling jobs you can even do with a spoon. But for the vast majority of your peeling needs, the Y-guy has got you covered. So fine, stay scrolling on Instagram. But please, for your own sake, get yourself a Y-peeler already.Kuhn Rikon Y-Peeler, Set of Three$14 at AmazonAnd then peel some stems for a broccoli quinoa salad, why dontcha?:All products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
