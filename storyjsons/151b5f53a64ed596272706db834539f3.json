It\u2019s complicated.By Adam RapoportJuly 16, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, prop styling by Kendra SmootFacebookTwitterEmailEvery Monday night, Bon App\u00e9tit editor in chief Adam Rapoport gives us a peek inside his brain by taking over our newsletter. He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.If it were up to me, every issue of Bon Appe\u0301tit magazine would be the Simple Issue.Select choice ingredients, futz with them as little as possible, season well with salt and pepper, and use a generous hand with the olive oil.And as editor in chief of this magazine, I suppose it is up to me. But have you ever tried to tell Andy Baraghani what to cook? Found yourself entrenched in a recipe argument with Carla Lalli Music? Been stared down by Julia Kramer when she doesn\u2019t agree with you and gives you that disapproving you-gotta-be-kidding-me look?Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Photo by Alex Lau, prop styling by Kendra SmootA big reason why BA has remained so strong these past several years is because of all the strong personalities who work here. If you ask for someone\u2019s opinion, don\u2019t worry\u2014you\u2019ll get it. Those unsubtle eye rolls by the editors in our hugely popular YouTube test kitchen videos? That\u2019s not hamming it up for the camera; that\u2019s all day, every day.But what I\u2019ve realized after these years on the job is that we\u2019re actually better when we don\u2019t agree. Or, at least, when we can acknowledge that maybe, sometimes, the other person is right.It\u2019s that creative tension that fuels our growth as recipe developers. Like the other day when contributing writer Priya Krishna pressed me on just what simple means\u2014 how what\u2019s simple to an Indian-American home cook might be very different from what it is to an olive-oil-and-salt-and-pepper guy like myself.Photo by Alex Lau, prop styling by Kendra SmootIt\u2019s this type of thinking that has made the food in BA increasingly more interesting over these past few years. It\u2019s why our test kitchen editors now regularly reach for jars of miso, tahini, and fish sauce just as my parents relied on ketchup, mayo, and mustard.I\u2019ll be the first to admit that I\u2019m too much of a creature of habit in the kitchen. I lean on my rotation of go-to recipes and techniques\u2014\u201cShould I just do that tomatoey chicken thing again tonight for dinner?\u201d But like most home cooks, I also know it\u2019s the introduction of new ingredients and techniques that supplies that jolt of excitement.So what does simple mean in 2019? To begin with, it doesn\u2019t have to mean \u201cthe same.\u201d When Andy lobbies me on a recipe that sounds unfamiliar, I should refrain from my reflexive eye roll. In fact, if it sounds unfamiliar, I should listen up.Yes, a simple recipe should never take too long or require too many ingredients. But beyond that, how about I open my mind? How about I expand my parameters of what simple means? I\u2019m realizing that the more I listen, the more I learn, and the simpler everything becomes.Get all the recipes from this issue:1 / 27ChevronChevronInflammation-Busting Pineapple SlushyView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titLetter From The EditorRead MorecultureSummer Pies Should All Be Deep DishBy Alex BeggsLifestyleThis Watermelon-Feta Salad Is Our New Go-To Summer SideBy Anna StockwellcookingZucchini Doesn't Have to Be Watery and SadBy Adam RapoportcookingThe Galette That Makes People Think I Work at Bon App\u00e9tit or SomethingBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
