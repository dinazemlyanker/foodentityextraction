Oh, and stirring in a little cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche at the end. This is one of the sides from Alison Roman\u2019s \u201cSteak House Night in America\u201d menu, alongside: Martini Bar, Low-and-Slow Rib Roast, Baked Potatoes Deluxe, and Upside-Down Apricot Tart.Recipe adapted with permission from Nothing Fancy: Unfussy Food for Having People Over by Alison Roman (Clarkson Potter, an imprint of Penguin Random House, LLC). Copyright \u00a9 2019.\u00a0Ingredients6\u20138 servings\u00becup fresh coarse breadcrumbs or panko6Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, dividedKosher salt, freshly ground pepper1\u00bdcups heavy cream6garlic cloves, smashed\u00bctsp. freshly grated nutmeg3large bunches kale, mustard greens, Swiss chard, spinach, and/or broccoli rabe (about 3 lb.), thick ribs and stems removed, coarsely chopped\u00becup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eechePreparationStep 1Toss breadcrumbs with 3 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet; season with salt and pepper. Set over medium-high heat and toast, tossing often, until golden brown and crisp, about 4 minutes. Set aside.Step 2Bring cream to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and nutmeg; season with salt and pepper. Simmer until reduced by half, 15\u201320 minutes. Once the cream gets added to the wilted greens, it will dilute and loosen up a bit, so it\u2019s better to aim for thicker rather than thinner.Step 3Meanwhile, heat remaining 3 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot (5.5 qt. or larger) over medium. Add a large handful of greens and season with salt and pepper. Cook until slightly wilted and there\u2019s room to add more greens to pot. Add another large handful of greens, season, and repeat process until all of the greens have been added. Continue to cook, stirring often, until greens are bright green and very tender and most of the liquid released from greens has evaporated, 10\u201322 minutes, depending on the greens you\u2019re using; spinach will release more liquid than kale.Step 4Add cream mixture and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche to greens and mix to coat evenly. Taste and season with more salt and pepper as needed. Cook just until heated through, about 2 minutes.Step 5Transfer greens to a bowl and scatter reserved breadcrumbs over.Step 6Do Ahead: Greens and breadcrumbs can be made 4 hours ahead. Store separately, loosely covered, at room temperature. Reheat greens over low and top with breadcrumbs just before serving.How would you rate The Greatest Creamed Greens?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (5)Back to TopTriangleThis was damn good! Turnip greens/chard/spinach.Used red pepper flakes in place of the nutmeg (some here not fans of nutmeg). Could just add a half teaspoon of them in addition too, I'm thinkingA cook from BuffaloBuffalo, NY3/10/2022Delicious! I add a shaving of freshly ground nutmeg, always to my creamed greens, and get rave reviews! I've also added a bit of lemon zest on top to serve.
