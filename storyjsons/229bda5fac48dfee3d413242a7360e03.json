As we deliberate over which bar to meet at, my suitor will ask me, \u201cWhat sort of drinks do you like?\u201d My answer is always the same: \u201cBlue ones.\u201dI used to wish I could be a Cool Girl who drinks IPAs or whiskey sours or hard liquor on the rocks. But I like my alcohol to taste like juice and look like Windex. My drink of choice can be found at any Margaritaville or palapa-roofed swim-up bar. And in truth I really don\u2019t care what\u2019s in it\u2014I often don\u2019t even know what\u2019s in it\u2014so long as it\u2019s blue.I\u2019ve spent the last year surveying every blue drink within a mile radius of my Brooklyn apartment. I\u2019ve tried the blue drinks of classy establishments (Silver Factory\u2019s dainty and flower-infused Lavender Sky; SEA\u2019s bubbly Ploy Lai Lin, garnished with a single cherry) and considerably divier ones (Abba\u2019s thick and slushy Frozen Blue Hawaiian; Rocka Rolla\u2019s Fish Bowl, served in a chalice and topped with Swedish Fish). Most of them get their whimsical color from various quantities of blue Cura\u00e7ao, an orange-flavored liqueur dyed with food coloring. But blue drinks are still reviled by some bartenders, many of whom are products of the Craft Cocktail Revolution, a shift in bar culture that began during the mid-1990s and went on to shape American mixology through the 2010s. In those years, cocktail-making became an elevated art form, and therefore Very Serious. At least, too serious for blue drinks.In a 2015 feature for Eater, Wine Enthusiast\u2019s spirits editor Kara Newman traced the history of blue drinks all the way back to their beginnings in mid-19th century England, where the invention of food dye\u2014then derived from coal tar (yum!)\u2014spurred a craze for colorful cocktails. By the early 20th century, coal-tar dyes were supplanted by better tasting and far less toxic ones (hooray for federal oversight!), and the Dutch colony and Caribbean island of Cura\u00e7ao began importing to the West a new, eponymous liqueur, which came in shades like green, red, orange, and that now-iconic blue. Though blue is now the most popular shade of Cura\u00e7ao, it didn\u2019t catch on widely until the years following World War II, when the deployment of servicemen to the Pacific Islands incited a wave of exoticism in the States: what Newman calls \u201cPolynesian drink and tiki culture,\u201d which painted forcefully colonized \u201cparadises'' as tropical playgrounds for the wealthy.Silver Factory\u2019s Lavender Sky.\nPhoto by Isa ZapataThen, at a 1957 liquor convention in Hawai\u2019i, the Dutch distiller Bols challenged bartenders to create new cocktails with blue Cura\u00e7ao. Harry Yee, head bartender at Waikiki\u2019s Hilton Hawaiian Village, came up with the blue drink to rule them all: the \u2018Blue Hawaii,\u2019 with vodka, rum, and pineapple juice. The hit film Blue Hawaii (in which a very tan Elvis strums a ukulele and dons a lei and floral shirt) followed, and from then on, mainland bartenders tied blue drinks to gauche tourist traps and their inauthentic faux-island aesthetic. Once the Craft Cocktail Revolution took hold several decades later, Newman writes, blue drinks were \u201cbanished from most cocktail menus.\u201dNow the Revolution has been fought and won. Today, craft cocktail bars can be found in most major American cities. Elaborate cocktail recipes fill the pages of countless books and magazines, not to mention an endless scroll of Google search results. Never has the artistry that goes into an extraordinary mixed drink been more apparent to cultural critics and consumers alike. But, since claiming victory, many Revolutionaries have grown more tolerant. In the past decade, blue drinks have slowly transcended the tiki bar and made their way onto craft cocktail menus, even at hip, quirkily-named New York City locales like Please Don\u2019t Tell, Angel\u2019s Share, and Subject.No longer is the consensus unanimous among mixologists that cocktails should be relegated to some sacred, serious realm. Bartenders like John deBary, author of the aptly-named Drink What You Want, recognize that quality drinks can also be vividly colored, elaborately adorned, and utterly biteless. When deBary first created his creamy, umbrella-garnished cocktail, \u2018The Shark,\u2019 he realized blueness could be used not just as a gimmick, but as an active aesthetic choice: \u201cIt\u2019s not subversively blue; it\u2019s intuitively blue,\u201d he wrote in Punch. \u201cIt\u2019s better because it\u2019s blue.\u201dThe early origins of blue drinks are undeniably wrapped up in colonialism and inherently othering notions of exoticism\u2014some of humanity\u2019s worst inclinations. But the blue drinks I\u2019ve encountered at bars across Brooklyn have also felt emblematic of our better impulses: to make beautiful and delicious things and then share those things with others. Blue drinks remind me why I drink in the first place\u2014not to impress anyone or convey something about who I am, but to have fun. To feel good. That synthetic, Barbicide-adjacent color? It\u2019s pretty! That fruity Capri Sun flavor? It\u2019s delicious! Those little Swedish Fish swimming atop my Fish Bowl? They bring me joy!In a world of such unyielding seriousness, blue drinks can be a small salve. At least this is what I tell my date when I sense in him a hint of skepticism (or worse, condescension) at my choice of beverage. Forgoing pleasure in the name of vanity is a romantic red flag. Just order the blue drink. It will be better\u2014you will be better\u2014because it\u2019s blue.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCultureRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
