That\u2019s embarrassing to admit because what I\u2019m saying is that I\u2019m bad at timers. Our recipe for jammy eggs is fewer than 100 words, and a lot of those words are about putting a pot of water on the stove. The only real step is waiting patiently for 6\u00bd minutes, but still, I pull my eggs from the ice bath only to find chalky yolks or unset whites and\u2014when I return to the dining room\u2014a group of friends who expected much more out of ramen night.They make it look so easy.\nSure, my colleagues in the test kitchen make boiled eggs out to be a science, but they did not consider that I am bad at science. But that\u2019s okay! Just because one aspect of cooking (even a really, really easy aspect of cooking) eludes me, it doesn\u2019t make me a bad chef. It just means I need some help\u2014and for me, that help comes from a little machine called the Dash Rapid Egg Cooker.The Dash is a mini steamer, and it\u2019s as simple an appliance as can be. It has one button that might as well just say EGGS, and for less than $20, it allows even the most timer-averse cook to attain jammy perfection every single time. To use it, just add water to the reservoir, place up to six eggs on the tray, cover, and press the button. A few minutes later, the Dash will sing a song to let you know it\u2019s (literally) out of steam, and voil\u00e0\u2014perfect boiled eggs. No tricks, no secrets, no science, that\u2019s the whole thing.Dash Rapid Egg Cooker$20 at Amazon$20 $18 at TargetI know single-use appliances can be a tough sell, but this one is smaller than a lot of my food storage containers. It\u2019s also freaking adorable\u2014an essential quality in any niche kitchen tool\u2014available in a whole slate of pretty pastel colors and shaped like a twee UFO from planet Egg. Above all else, it\u2019s just so easy to use. You adjust the firmness of your yolks by tweaking the amount of water you add with an included measuring cup, which has labels for Soft, Medium, and Hard. I\u2019ve found that by slightly under-filling the cup, I can skip the ice bath entirely and let the eggs cool inside the Dash, which means no more empty ice trays at cocktail hour.In my kitchen, the Dash Rapid Egg Cooker has turned boiled eggs into the no-stress topping and ingredient I\u2019ve always wanted them to be. I can turn it on when I start making instant noodles for a more filling snack. I can make potluck-ready quantities of deviled eggs without throwing away a shameful amount of duds. Most important, it lets me focus on the parts of cooking I\u2019m good at\u2014and the parts that actually interest me\u2014and that\u2019s the kind of convenience I\u2019m willing to pay for.Put an egg on it:Thai Basil Sauce Noodles with Jammy EggsThese noodles hit every note we look for in a satisfying dinner: Herbaceous, saucy noodles, fresh crunchy toppings, and a jammy egg on top. It's really worth seeking out grassy, spicy Thai basil for the the three-ingredient basil sauce.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make.
