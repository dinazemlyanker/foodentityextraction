Always a hit when we bring it to the barbecue. We've also found that it works with literally any combination of canned beans, and it's best if you've got a variety of different sizes and textures - butter beans are especially nice in contrast to smaller beans, and slightly firmer pigeon peas add a nice pop of color too. I've never found ricotta salata so I usually sub feta or skip it altogether. DuffuserIndiana8/10/2021Love this salad.  Super easy, flavorful, healthy and goes with literally anything I am serving!!!CarlaEdina, MN11/30/2020So easy, super delicious.
