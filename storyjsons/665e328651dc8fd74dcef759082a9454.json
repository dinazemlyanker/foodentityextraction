When that happens, I simply pivot to a dish I know will work under any circumstances, no matter how dinky the grocery store or limited the equipment. That\u2019s right: I\u2019m talking about meatballs.I don\u2019t mean the Italian-American variety that simmers for hours in red sauce. The meatballs I speak of are light and bright, loaded with fresh herbs and garlic, and swimming in a pot of brothy spring vegetables. It\u2019s the ideal dish to make when you want an easy and meaty main course, but aren\u2019t looking to spend hours on a braise or roast. And whether you\u2019re shopping at a small local spot or a giant chain, most grocery stores will have what you need to make meatballs, which is a lot more than I can say about cooking a whole lamb.The meatballs themselves are made of nothing more than ground meat (I like pork, lamb, beef, or a mix), onion, chopped herbs like chives or parsley, and a little yogurt to bind them. Spices like crushed fennel seed or black pepper are optional, but recommended. If you\u2019re wondering where the breadcrumbs and egg are, well, they aren\u2019t here\u2014I told you, these are light!I like to brown the meatballs in a large Dutch oven or pot, then add whatever spring-y vegetables I can get my hands on (which, if it\u2019s not quite spring yet where you are, frozen peas are totally fine\u2014don\u2019t @ me!), and let that briefly simmer in some chicken or vegetable broth. And since I\u2019m not trying to cook a keto-friendly meal for anyone ever, I also like to serve large bowls of cooked grains or tiny pasta such as fregola or Israeli couscous to ladle the brothy meatballs over. Torn pieces of crusty bread would also be an excellent substitute if you wanted to dunk and dip.All that\u2019s left to do is spoon everything into bowls and set out a few unfussy toppings: lemon wedges, some fresh herbs to scatter over, and yogurt for dolloping (you already bought both to make the meatballs, so why not?). It\u2019s lazy, it\u2019s impressive, it\u2019s vacation food at it\u2019s finest.Get the recipe:Brothy Meatballs with Peas, Fennel, and Tiny PastaThis dish is a perfect choice for those blustery but bright early spring days: It's comforting from the simple-but-flavorful broth and bright from the crunchy fresh topping.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titRecipeMeatballSpringVacationsRead MorerecipesIf Your Ideal Weekend Involves Cooking With Friends, These Recipes Are Meant for YouGallery4 SlidesBy Alison RomanRecipes you want to make.
