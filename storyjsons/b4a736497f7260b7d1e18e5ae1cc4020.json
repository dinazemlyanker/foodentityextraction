The combination of the brussel sprouts and cranberry mostarda was so tast. The mostarda stands on its own as a condiment to serve with grilled meats and or cheese.  PilarHuntington Beach, Ca12/21/2021Pss...If you want more zip/heat, try black mustard seeds!rafBerta AnneLA, Ca.12/21/2020Hello, Mostarda could always be found in my Italian kitchen when I was, a lot, younger.\nI am so happy to see this recipe as no one wrote it out. This will be on my condiment tray forever.\nI do believe there might have been a little wine involved. Perhaps it was to drink as they worked, not sure.\nThank You! I can now pass this to my family. I will need to look for 4 pretty jars, I still have my Great Grandmother's jar. As I am the oldest female in my generation I have much beautiful glassware.\nAt this place in time I was not much looking forward to making a full dinner for Christmas, now I can not wait!\nAs I live in a multi culture apart building I will share this with my neighbors as they share with me!raf\nPlease stay Happy and Healthy!!!Berta AnneFallbrook, Ca.12/21/2020I loved it\nWhen I first made the Mostarda IT was sooo spicy but it definitely mellowed out as it sat\nOceaneLund canada12/24/2019Totally didn\u2019t let the mostarda sit the whole 12 hours before eating, and it was still incredible on the roasted Brussels \ud83d\ude0d I just made sure to give the fruit a hand by smashing the mixture a bit with an avocado masher. Also, I only used about 24 oz. of brussels for me and my partner. So, there\u2019s so much delicious mostarda left over. Think I might try it with some roasted asparagus nextAnonymousRichmond, Virginia12/6/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titBrussels SproutVegetableCranberryBerryFruitPruneDried FruitFallSideDairy-FreeGluten-FreeVeganVegetarianHealthyishRoastThanksgivingDinnerRecipes you want to make.
