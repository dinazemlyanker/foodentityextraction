When something\u2019s so easy to make that you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.As a healthcare provider working in the midst of a global pandemic, I try to limit my trips to the grocery store, which means buying longer-lasting vegetables. A sturdy, reliable Napa cabbage, which lasts for weeks in the fridge, is one of my favorites. There are so many ways to use cabbage, but my standby is this deceptively simple cabbage stir-fry. It also comes together in less than 15 minutes.My dad made this dish for me all the time when I was a kid. Though he grew up in Shanghai, his parents and extended family are from Sichuan, so his palate and cooking incorporated a bit of both places: a balance of salty and sweet (though heavier on the latter), a love of black vinegar, a deep appreciation for warming aromatics, and the heat that Sichuan is famous for. This dish\u2014slightly wilted but still crispy cabbage coated in a tangy sauce\u2014is a great reflection of my dad\u2019s cooking, as well as a gateway to simple vegetable stir-fries.Here\u2019s how you make this cabbage stir-fry: Separate the leaves of 1 head Napa cabbage and rinse thoroughly. Tear into chunks and separate the leaves (the top two-thirds of the cabbage) from the stems (the bottom third).\u00a0Thinly slice 3 cloves garlic. Coarsely chop 1 dried chile pepper. In addition to the garlic and pepper, use any other aromatic you desire: Sometimes I will toss in sliced ginger or scallions or a piece of star anise.\u00a0In a small bowl, mix equal parts soy sauce and black vinegar with small amounts of salt, sugar, and cornstarch. I use 1 Tbsp. soy sauce and 1 Tbsp. black vinegar with \u00bd tsp. salt, 1 tsp. sugar, and 1 tsp. cornstarch. If you want a saucier dish, double these quantities. If you don\u2019t have black vinegar, you can substitute with rice or balsamic vinegar. Or try punching it up with fermented black beans or pixian doubanjiang.Heat your wok over high heat until hot. Add about 1 Tbsp. neutral oil and swirl to cook, then add garlic, chopped dried peppers (toss in some Sichuan peppercorns if you\u2019d like) and \u201cexplode into fragrance.\u201d Reduce heat a bit, then add the cabbage stems first, cook for a minute, toss in the leaves, cook for 30 seconds, until just wilted, then add your sauce. Stir-fry quickly to combine.\u00a0This general flow for stir-fry can be applied to many other greens, and the varieties are endless. I love doing this with bok choy, yu-choy, water spinach, chives, or bean sprouts. \u00a0If you're using a green that will take more time to cook (such as asparagus or broccoli), simply cover with lid and let the veg steam with the sauce for five minutes before serving.\u00a0The resulting dish should have tangy sauce clinging to the cabbage, which still retains some crunch, with a slow heady heat from the pepper. I eat this with rice or congee, and the tangy flavor pairs wonderfully with meats such as beef, pork, or lamb. Cabbage does it again.Goes well with congee:Pork and Shiitake CongeeSince congee can take hours to make on the stovetop, we came up with a clever trick: Rinse the rice and freeze it overnight.\u00a0View RecipeRecipes you want to make.
