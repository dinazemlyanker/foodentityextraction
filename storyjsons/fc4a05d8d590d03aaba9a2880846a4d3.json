But why choose? Valentine\u2019s Day is right around the corner and there\u2019s no better gift for your number-one dining partner than a piece of food jewelry. A well-chosen set of earrings or pendant necklace is an opportunity to say to your boo, \u201cI know you like beets. I see you.\u201d To help you in your quest for the perfect token, we\u2019ve rounded up BA staffers\u2019 favorite necklaces, bracelet charms, and earrings, all shaped like the foods we love most.OIYA Chile Pepper EarringsThese days I\u2019ve been manifesting something\u2014anything\u2014to come along and spice up my life. So when I noticed these delicate glass pendant chile pepper earrings while shopping for a friend\u2019s baby on Maisonette, I simply had to add them to my cart. They\u2019re a subtle nod to my love of cooking but cute and abstract enough to not make it A Thing. (\u201cChile pepper earrings aren\u2019t a personality, Ali.\u201d) I truly cannot wait to\u2026wear them to the grocery store? Laundromat? While bingeing mid-\u201990s rom-coms from my couch? Hey, it\u2019s the little things. \u2014Ali Francis, associate editorOIYA Chile Pepper Earrings$88 at Maisonette$88 at OIYACatbird Holy Cannoli CharmCatbird\u2019s wares include a mix of lovely jewelry from the brand\u2019s Brooklyn-based design studio and extraordinary pieces from the most talented indie designers in the business. I never pass up an opportunity to ooh and ahh over the delicate gold chains, teeny tiny diamonds, and expert craftsmanship they\u2019re known for, so I simply couldn\u2019t contain myself when I stumbled upon their Holy Cannoli charm. Made of recycled 14k gold, this little treat is flanked by two of the tiniest pearls I\u2019ve ever seen. Swoon. Wearing my heart on my sleeve might be cliche, but wearing a cannoli on it? Baby, that\u2019s amore! \u2014Jenna Adrian-Diaz, assistant to the editor in chiefHoly Cannoli Charm$118 at Catbird\u00c9liou Shroomie NecklaceTo me a colorful, playful piece of jewelry is not only iconic for any age or gender but also versatile for any occasion. \u00c9liou\u2019s handmade shroomie necklace is my go-to for gifting (self-gifts included). Who knew the combination of freshwater pearls and colorful glass beads could make mushrooms feel like candy on your neck? Layer it with other pieces or let it shine solo on a white tee\u2014there\u2019s no wrong way to work these shroomies. \u2014Caroline Newton, design director\u00c9liou\u2019s Shroomie Necklace$175 at \u00c9liouPrada Banana EarringsHello, world? Yes, hi. It\u2019s me. Here to tell you that I have never wanted something more than these Andy Warhol-esque sterling silver and acrylic clip-on banana earrings. I know I said that last time, about the other thing, but this time I mean it. They are the most spectacular food earrings I\u2019ve ever seen, designed after the fruit I have the deepest love-hate relationship with, which makes them emotionally significant, like poetry clipped to my ears. They cost $595 so I don\u2019t think my husband is going to buy them for me this Valentine\u2019s Day. But if you do, I\u2019m yours. Forever. Or at least until I lose one. Thank you. I love you? DM for mailing address. \u2014Hilary Cadigan, culture editorPrada Banana Earrings$595 at FarfetchKate Spade Pizza Hoops and PendantWhoever set the precedent of giving chocolate to loved ones on Valentine\u2019s Day perhaps never tried pizza. Nothing says romance like sharing a pie with someone you love most. Enter these pizza hoops and pendant from Kate Spade, which have replaced my favorite grease-laden roni cups with jeweled red hearts and cheese with cubic zirconia. The perfect gift to give someone a\u2026pizza my heart. \u2014Kate Kassin, editorial operations associatePizza My Heart Earrings$98 at Kate SpadePizza My Heart Pendant$78 at Kate SpadeSusan Alexandra Shrimp Cocktail EarringsI can\u2019t imagine anything more fabulously camp than showing up to a fancy cocktail party in these sparkly shrimp cocktail earrings from Susan Alexandra. Who else but New York\u2019s queen of beaded accessories could make shellfish so stylish? Just make sure no one tries to nibble your ear (unless, of course, you\u2019re into that). \u2014Chala Tyson Tshitundu, assistant editorShrimp Cocktail Earrings$155 at Susan AlexandraVersace Iced Coffee Cup CharmIf you\u2019re married to a homosexual like I am, you know that the only thing queers love more than iced coffee is Versace. This gold-toned brass pendant (chain not included) is embellished with crystals, Versace\u2019s signature Greca borders, and the face of my second favorite Gorgon, Medusa. If you really want to impress, pair the charm with the super-sized version\u2014this $1100, crystal-studded travel cup with reusable straw. \u201cIs it too much?\u201d you\u2019re thinking. In the eternal words of Quavo, \u201cVersace Versace Versace Versace.\u201d \u2014MacKenzie Chung Fegan, senior commerce editorVersace Iced Coffee Cup Charm$375 $113 at SSENSE$375 $262 at Luisa Via RomaWOLL Jewelry Beet EarringsThe beet is a vegetable born to be made into earrings: Its deep red color is to die for and the leaves and stems allow it to dangle quite nicely\u2014nay! dramatically\u2014from your earlobes. I\u2019m also here for more root vegetable representation in jewelry. Why should strawberries get all the attention? \u2014Esra Erol, senior social media managerBeet Earrings$45 at WollKFC Finger Lickin\u2019 Good NecklaceEvery few months I suddenly remember the loss I felt when I neglected to purchase KFC\u2019s 2017 limited edition raglan sweatshirt emblazoned with the phrase \u201cFried Chicken USA.\u201d In those times I\u2019ll scour the recesses of the internet hoping to find someone willing to sell theirs at a reasonable price. No luck yet. This \u201cFinger Lickin\u2019 Good\u201d necklace was part of the same release, and while it doesn\u2019t have the same vintage appeal, it\u2019s just tacky enough that I love it almost as much. \u2014Joe Sevier, cooking and SEO editorKFC Finger Lickin\u2019 Good Necklace$125 at EbayMociun Waffle CharmHigh on the list of \u201cthings I want but don\u2019t need and can\u2019t afford\u201d is this lovely, delicate waffle charm featuring a tiny, perfect dollop of diamond-studded whipped cream. It\u2019s sold as part of Brooklyn-based jewelry Mociun\u2019s fine foods line, which also boasts a decadent deviled egg with a yolky swirl of yellow gold and yellow diamonds, a cereal spoon complete with a rainbow of \u201ccereal\u201d gems, and the most elegant sliced fruit charms. While one might say there\u2019s a time and a place for life-size shrimp cocktail or pop art banana earrings, this dainty waffle works as an everyday staple, with just enough sparkle to transition seamlessly from day to night. It\u2019s the perfect gift for the food obsessive who loves decadence and breakfast, already owns a luxury coffee setup and a designer gravy boat, and still has disposable income to burn. It might not be in my budget, but it certainly lives rent-free in my mind. \u2014Sonia Chopra, executive editorWhipped Cream Waffle Charm$1,100 at MociunGourd Friend Enoki Mushroom EarringsGarlic girls are having a moment\u2014but I am a mushroom girl, first and foremost. Made of iridescent acrylic that looks clear from some angles and reflects colorful light from others, these enoki mushroom earrings from Gourd Friend are the perfect homage to my favorite food. Forget diamonds\u2014I want shiny \u2019shrooms. \u2014Bettina Makalintal, associate editorEnoki Mushroom Earrings$10 at Gourd FriendExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingGift GuidesRecipes you want to make.
