Substitutes for Parmesan CheeseCash doesn't grow on trees. Neither does Parmesan. These are the cheeses that solve that problem.By Alex DelanyJune 5, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailIn a perfect world, we\u2019d have a limitless Parm budget. There would simply be no reason to find any substitute for Parmesan cheese, the undisputed heavyweight champion of hard, salty, tangy dairy products. We would drop thousands of dollars on massive wheels of the stuff. We\u2019d stack them up and make houses out of them. Replace the tires on our cars with Parmesan wheels and use them as ottomans. And yes, cook with them too. But we can\u2019t. Because the famed Italian cow\u2019s milk cheese that we\u2019ve been in love with since our first bite of fettuccine alfredo is expensive. And our Parmesan budget is much smaller than we wish it was. And as a result, sometimes we turn to other cheaper, still totally delicious options to get our fix.Parmesan (or Parmigiano Reggiano) is expensive for two reasons: 1. True Parmesan can only be made in a particular region of Italy, and 2. Parmesan is usually aged between 18 and 36 months. This means that there are only a small number of cheese producers making true Parmesan, and that cheese has to sit around for a while before it\u2019s fully matured. Tasty cheese needs time, and time is money. So when we don't feel like shelling out for the real thing, we turn to cheeses with similar textures and flavor profiles that are a little easier on the checking account. They still deliver that dried, nutty, easily grate-able goodness that we love in Parmesan, but with a few small differences. Here are our three favorite substitutes for Parmesan cheese:Michael Graydon & Nikole HerriottPiaveParmesan has a little brother, and his name is Piave. This Italian cow\u2019s milk cheese is the most similar to Parmesan out there, but it\u2019s a little less mature. No, not like it tells dirty jokes at the dinner table. More like it\u2019s only aged 12 months instead of the 18-36 months that most Parmesan is aged for. Since Piave is younger, it\u2019s umami-rich flavors and toasty nuttiness are less developed. It\u2019s a tad sweeter than Parmesan, and noticeably creamier. But it\u2019s still hard enough to grate into sauces and on top of roasted vegetables, toasts, and pastas.Pecorino RomanoThis is the cheese that most people will reach for when Parmesan isn\u2019t in the cards. Pecorino\u2019s base flavor and texture are similar to Parmesan\u2019s, but it has a couple key differences. Pecorino is made from sheep\u2019s milk, which contains more fat than cow\u2019s milk. But most importantly, Pecorino is a tad sharper than Parmesan and a hell of a lot saltier. Its saltiness can overwhelm pasta dishes with delicate sauces, so if you\u2019re using Pecorino in a recipe that calls for Parmesan, make sure to dial back on the kosher salt.Grana PadanoHere\u2019s another Italian cow\u2019s milk cheese with a protected name. Like Parmesan, Grana Padano has to be made in a certain region of Italy, but Grana Padano\u2019s region is much larger, which ultimately makes the cheese more affordable, since more producers can make the cheese. While Pecorino turns up the salt and flavor, Grana Padano is much milder. The savory, nutty flavors are similar to Parmesan, but Grana Padano is generally less crumbly, so expect a softer cheese that works better when mixed into sauces than it does when grated on top of pastas.This is all to say that if it's the distinctive flavor and texture of true Parmigiano Reggiano you're after, you're going to have to shell out for the real thing. But if it's a less-specific hit of rich, salty cheesiness that you need to punch up that platter of salad or bowl of pasta, you've got options. Great options, in fact.You can use all of these cheeses in carbonara. So go do that.Simple CarbonaraThe no-food-in-the-house dinner of our dreams.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyCheeseParmesanPastaRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
