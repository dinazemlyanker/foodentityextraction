Alternatively, you can broil the eggplants in the oven, turning occasionally, until charred and tender. They might not end up as smoky, but the final dip will still taste great.

She grills the eggplant, cools it, separates the burnt skin from the inside (its a tedious job, but necessary), washes it very well, then presses it to remove the liquid, then into food processor until smooth; chopped onions, vegetable oil, and salt.  That's it.  No tahini at all.  That wonderful smoky, sweet flavor of the eggplant comes through.  I do three eggplants at a time, and get a nice size bowl.  Sally C.bradford, pa6/27/2021Looks great, but are you supposed to char the eggplant in a pan if you have to use a stove, or are you supposed to hold it over the open flame?Ellen LittleCharlotte, NC USA10/15/2019This was delish!! I didn't feel like Maki g a special trip just for the pomegranate and black sesame seeds, so I didn't have pretty garnishes, but I did not miss them. The hubby and I ate this with olives and naan and it was devoured. New fave!!!jennaprather65924Lincoln, Nebraska 8/16/2019Do you have any thoughts on what could be done with the charred skin besides throwing it away? I mean I know it's mostly ash, but I've seen burnt onion powder used in food before, I just have no idea how I would make it.kkfood4/27/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titCondimentDipMiddle EasternLebaneseEggplantVegetableTahiniCondiments, Sauces & PastesStarterSnackDairy-FreeGluten-FreeVegetarianVeganHealthyishGrillingRecipes you want to make.
