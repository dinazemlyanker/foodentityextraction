So this is it: the moment you learn how to clean shrimp.But first, congratulations. While you can buy shrimp that\u2019s already been peeled and deveined by a machine, they\u2019re a little rough and ready\u2014neither as plump nor as pristine as shrimp you clean yourself. Plus, handling the shrimp at home allows you to stockpile those shrimp shells, which are a source of great flavor in seafood stocks for bisque, stew, risotto, and the like. (If you\u2019re wondering about the frozen thing, yes, we do recommend frozen shrimp. Since shrimp is often processed and frozen on the boat or the farm, even the \u201cfresh\u201d shrimp at the store has been previously frozen.)While cleaning shrimp\u2014i.e., removing the shell and the dark vein\u2014isn\u2019t as simple as, say, cleaning herbs, it\u2019s easy to master and there are lots of ways to do it. This is what works well for me (and makes me feel like a masterful surgeon), but with a bit of practice you\u2019ll figure out the method that\u2019s fastest and neatest for you,\\ too.Here\u2019s how to clean shrimp:First, remove the shell. One option is to use brute force to rip off the legs (along the inner curve of the shrimp), then pry apart the shell by getting your thumbs underneath and cracking it away from the crustacean as if you\u2019re taking off its coat (and you are, kind of).Photography by Isa Zapata. \u00a0Food Styling by Cyd McDowellI prefer, however, to use a small pair of kitchen shears (this petite pair from Joyce Chen is perfect for tasks like this). To do so, insert the tip of one blade underneath the shell at the top along the outer curve, then snip toward the tail. If you want shell-on, deveined shrimp (for BA\u2019s Best Shrimp Cocktail, for example), pause here and skip to the next step.Otherwise, peel back the shell from either side\u2014you can take the legs off with it\u2014and either discard or save for stock. At this point you can leave the tail on (a convenient handle for shrimp served as finger food) or remove it (perhaps a nice touch if the shrimp is getting incorporated into a soup or pasta).Photograph by Isa Zapata. \u00a0Food Styling by Cyd McDowellThen remove the vein. The dark vein that runs along the back of the shrimp is actually the end of its digestive tube. So no, it\u2019s not a vein in the sense of a human vein and yes, it\u2019s filled with shrimp digestive material (okay fine, it\u2019s poo). Anyway, the vein, while not harmful for humans to consume, can be gritty and taste a bit grimy (also, it\u2019s not cute). While you don\u2019t have to remove it from small shrimp, a good rule of thumb is: If you can see it, remove it.To do so, make a shallow cut with the shears or a paring knife along the shrimp\u2019s back. If you\u2019ve already used your shears to remove the shell, you might not need to cut any deeper. Use the tip of the paring knife or scissor blade to get under the dark vein and gently tug it out from the top. Since the vein is fairly elastic, it often comes out in one piece. If it breaks apart, simply pick it up and finish the job.Only one question remains: Now that your shrimp are all squeaky clean\u2014ready to be seared, pilaf\u2019d, poached in ghee, or doused in a dilly cream sauce\u2014when\u2019s the last time you took a shower?Ready for your shrimp:Shrimp and Salami PastaIf plopping an entire stick of butter into a pot of noodles is your idea of a good time (it\u2019s definitely ours), this saucy shrimp and salami pasta is for you.View RecipeShrimp ScampiThis shrimp scampi recipe gets an extra punch of garlicky flavor from a short marinade before cooking.
