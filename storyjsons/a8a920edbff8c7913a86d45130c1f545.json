And while there\u2019s a lot of dubious bro-science about weightlifting and nutrition, one thing we seem to agree on is that increasing your protein intake (to around 0.8 to 1 gram per pound of body weight per day) is helpful for\u2026the gainz. That\u2019s kind of a lot when you consider that even protein-packed foods like chicken and fish only have around 30 grams per serving. Then there\u2019s the convenience issue: Who has time to grill a steak after every workout?Let\u2019s get huge.\nWhey, which contains dairy (but little to no lactose), has long dominated the protein powder market\u2014and my kitchen. It\u2019s popular because it has a clean, neutral flavor, and it mixes easily in milk and water. But in recent years, I\u2019ve watched as vegan protein powders have surged onto shelves.\u201cThis stuff isn\u2019t just for those who follow a vegan diet,\u201d says Taylor Wolfram, MS, LDN, a registered dietitian nutritionist. \u201cIf someone\u2019s body isn\u2019t tolerating animal-based protein powders, trying out vegan options is a great idea. Also folks with animal welfare and environmental concerns will want to consider vegan protein powder as it\u2019s much kinder to animals and has a gentler impact on the environment.\u201dVegan protein powder can be made from virtually any legume, seed, or grain, from hemp seeds to brown rice to watermelon seeds. According to Wolfram, \u201cvegan protein powders based on legumes like soy and pea protein powder\u201d are going to provide the most high-quality, bioavailable protein. She warns that, like any protein powder, vegan options may contain added sugar alcohols like erythritol and xylitol, which can give some people digestive issues.The one time I\u2019d tried vegan protein powder it was from a health food co-op, and it was truly nauseating in flavor, texture, and appearance. But I wondered if, in this new era of plant-based innovation, we\u2019d finally gotten vegan protein powder right. I was down to give it another shot, but only if I could find the best vegan protein powder out there, and by \u201cbest\u201d I mean most delicious. (And if you\u2019re really on that health kick, also check out our review of the best greens powders you\u2019ll actually want to drink.)So my quest began. I lined my countertop with tubs of vanilla protein or as close to vanilla as I could get (isn\u2019t that what they call the scientific method?), put my ancient Magic Bullet to the test,* and landed on 11 brands ranging from totally palatable to truly the best tasting plant-based protein powder I\u2019ve tried.*I\u2019m sad to report that the Magic Bullet subsequently died, but it had had a good life, and I replaced it with the Nutribullet Pro 1000, which, editor, I would love to review at a later date.Future Kind Organic Vegan Protein Powder\u00a0This was a great entry-level vegan protein. Mild and meek and barely sweet, it embodies \u201cvanilla\u201d in more ways than one. One 85-calorie scoop delivers 20 grams of protein made from the humble pea. It\u2019s sweetened with stevia but doesn\u2019t have any of that bitter, cloying aftertaste. This was the only protein powder that mixed up great in a shaker bottle, no blender required. Did it thrill me? No. But I can get my thrills in places other than a tub of organic vegan protein.Future Kind Vegan Protein Powder$45 at Future Kind$54.99 $49.99 at AmazonKOS Organic Plant Protein\u00a0Full disclosure, I did not love this USDA-certified organic protein powder, but my living companion polished it right off (he adds about half a jar of peanut butter and actual candy bars to his post-workout protein shakes, so the powder is pretty incidental). KOS is one of those Instagram brands that popped up so many times on my feed that I finally gave in and bought a tub. The branding is cute, I will say that. The taste, however, was stevia-sour on the front end and vegetal on the back, which makes sense given that it has a farmers market\u2019s worth of produce in powdered form, including shiitake mushrooms and tomato. This might also be why it\u2019s got a bit of a sludgy bottom when mixed with water or milk alone. Each serving has 150 calories and 20 grams of complete protein from flaxseed, quinoa, pumpkin seed, chia seed, and organic pea protein.KOS Organic Plant Based Protein Powder$45 at Amazon (39.15 oz)$20 at Target (13.05 oz)About Time Vegan Protein\u00a0I\u2019d used About Time\u2019s whey protein powder ages ago and was excited to see that it had three vegan flavors now, all of which use a blend of pea, brown rice, and pumpkin seed protein and include a full panel of BCAAs. Stevia is the only sweetener, and there are 122 calories and 22 grams of protein in each scoop. The vanilla flavor mixed perfectly into almond milk and had a clean, neutral taste. When I stirred it into cooked oatmeal (a thing I do a lot), it incorporated nicely without clumping.About Time Vanilla Protein Supplement$39.99 at Amazon$40 at GNCGarden of Life Raw Organic Protein\u00a0This is one of those proteins I\u2019ve been seeing in health food stores for years, and I will say it fully commits to its brand. And if ~health~ is your personal brand, this is the powder for you. There\u2019s a farmer on the packaging! And carrots! And grapes? Also this one is made from an organic plant formula, non-GMO, and raw. (I went down a rabbit hole trying to figure out why other vegan proteins were not raw and emerged confused, but do with that info what you will.) Each scoop has 130 calories and 22 grams of protein, and no, there are actually not carrots or grapes in here, but there are literally 14 protein sources, ranging from pea protein to millet sprout to adzuki bean to something called \u201ccracked wall chlorella,\u201d which I assume is superior to normal chlorella. Sweetness comes in the form of erythritol and stevia. Upon first sip, I thought, This tastes raw and like dirt, so there\u2019s truth in advertising, I guess.Garden of Life Raw Organic Protein Vanilla Powder$34 at Amazon$34 at Thrive MarketPlantFusion Complete Protein\u00a0This protein powder is SO FINE, and I\u2019m not talking about looks. I\u2019m talking about texture, baby. If I didn\u2019t have the ingredients list in front of me, I\u2019d swear it was made from the sands of Dune. It also tastes really good, with a creamy, rich mouthfeel and a decent amount of sweetness from a combo of stevia, monk fruit, lucuma, and yacon powders\u2013fancy! Pea protein is the first ingredient, but there\u2019s also quinoa, amaranth, artichoke, algae, and branch-chain amino acids, a.k.a. BCAAs (good for muscle growth). Their powers combine to provide 21 grams of protein, 120 calories, and just a liiiittle bit of a weird aftertaste. Because it\u2019s SO FINE, there was some residue left in the bottom of the blender, but nothing too bothersome.PlantFusion Vanilla Protein Powder$40 at Amazon$51 at TargetOrgain Organic ProteinOrgain is one of the more affordable vegan proteins on the market. It is made from a protein blend of pea, brown rice, and chia and has 21 grams of protein per each 150 calorie serving. Although it\u2019s sweetened with erythritol, a sugar alcohol, it\u2019s got more calories and carbs than most other protein powders. It also has a surprisingly great flavor, even with water alone. It mixes up silky smooth and just thick enough, like a glass of vanilla soy milk, with no weird vegetal aftertaste. This one is the budget pick for sure.Orgain Organic Vanilla Protein Powder$27 at Amazon$32 at OrgainNo Cow Protein Powder\u00a0In its silver metallic tub with its fancy metal scooper, No Cow tastes as expensive as it looks. The yellowish tint made me think I\u2019d be getting eggy French vanilla vibes, but the flavor was balanced and not too sweet. Made from pea and brown rice protein as well as stevia and erythritol, each 130-calorie scoop of No Cow has a protein content of 22 grams. This one will mix into anything and basically disappear, which is exactly what you want from a protein powder sometimes.No Cow Vanilla Protein Powder$40 at No Cow$40 at AmazonVega Sport Premium Protein\u00a0This is the Old Spice of protein powders, marketed to manly men who Lift Heavy and Eat Clean and Consume an Unholy Amount of Protein. When I opened the tub, the powder clung to the lid like it was magnetized, which was kind of creepy but also cool, like maybe you\u2019d build muscle and become part superhero if you used it. Made from pea, pumpkin seed, sunflower seed, and alfalfa, it offers 30 big boy grams of protein in each 160-calorie scoop. Yes, the scooper is huge. It mixes up to an impossibly smooth and rich beverage, like an aged scotch or a vintage Pinot, if those things were milkshakes. Sweetened with stevia, it\u2019s a classy choice for classy dudes\u2026and me.Vega Sport Vanilla Protein Powder$40 at Amazon$55 at VegaBowmar Nutrition Vegan Protein\u00a0Bowmar has six vegan flavors(!) but for some reason they passed on vanilla, so I went with Cookies & Cream, which tasted so incredible I wondered if maybe I was just sick of vanilla. One scoop has 100 calories and 20 grams of protein from peas as well as pumpkin, sunflower, and watermelon seeds. If that sounds gritty, it\u2019s not. This one mixes well with just milk, retaining some pleasant chocolate cookie crumbles throughout. It is sweetened with sucralose, so if you\u2019re not about artificial sweeteners, walk on by.Bowmar Cookies and Cream Vegan Protein Powder$50 at Campus ProteinOWYN Plant Protein Powder\u00a0OWYN, which like many of the other options on this list is gluten-free, dairy-free, and soy-free, stands for Only What You Need. If what you need is a delicious egg cream\u2013like beverage that happens to have 140 calories and 20 grams of pea, pumpkin, and chia protein, you\u2019ll agree. You could quibble about the 4 grams of cane sugar, but maybe it\u2019s canceled out by the \u201cSuperfood & Greens\u201d blend of broccoli, kale, and spinach? I\u2019ll let you do your own math, but the flavor was rich and creamy, with just a slightly chalky texture when mixed with almond milk alone. Add a frozen banana, and you\u2019ve got a truly decadent smoothie.OWYN Vanilla Protein Powder$26 at Amazon$36 at WalmartBeam Vegan Protein\u00a0I found out about Beam through an Instagram wellness influencer, and that makes sense to me because Beam is the \u201cthat girl\u201d of vegan protein supplements, with its sleek packaging and quirky flavor lineup (also no vanilla). I wanted to hate it, but instead I loved it more than I reasonably should have. If the limited-edition Birthday Cake flavor is available (it comes and goes), buy it immediately. But Cinnamon Cereal is a close second; it tastes like cereal milk and has zero aftertaste despite blending pea, pumpkin seed, and mung bean protein with apple fiber, blueberry fiber, and red algae thrown in for good measure. One scoop is 100 calories and 20 grams of protein, and the only downside is the sucralose\u2014artificial, but so, so good.Beam Cinnamon Cereal Protein Powder$50 at BeamExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingCultureRecipes you want to make.
