The original bananas Foster recipe was invented for Owen\u00a0Brennan's restaurant, Vieux Carr\u00e9, in the 1950s. This New Orleans classic consists of caramelized bananas and a pyrotechnic rum sauce that delivers all the tableside drama.If you\u2019re hesitant about tackling a flamb\u00e9ed dish at home, that\u2019s understandable! But with a few tablespoons of rum contained in a skillet (off the heat) and a long-reach lighter or long match to keep you away from the flames, you\u2019ll get all of the wow factor and flavor with none of the danger. Slightly underripe bananas work well here, as they soften nicely in the caramel sauce but maintain their shape while cooking. While the toasted pecans aren\u2019t traditional, they add delightful crunch.Vanilla ice cream is the classic accompaniment, but you could also spoon the saucy mix over waffles, crepes, French toast, or even toasted slices of banana bread.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.
