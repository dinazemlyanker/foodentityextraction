That's the principle behind two of our greatest innovations: skyscrapers and the tiered cooling rack that changed my life.Perhaps that is an exaggeration, but here's the truth: The amount of baking I do is disproportionate to the counter space in my kitchen. This means that there are almost always hot baking sheets or flocks of cookies in need of a resting place to cool undisturbed. I'll leave them in the turned-off oven (which seems smart until I start preheating it for something else), or on top of the stove (smart until I need a burner), or on the table in the other room (smart until I hear a crashing sound and realize the cats have had free reign).The tiered cooling rack\u2014double the vertical space for the same amount of horizontal space\u2014alleviates the problem. Suddenly I can cool twice the amount of stuff in the same constrained space. It's like a space-making machine. There are even tiered racks with three levels: The sky's the limit!I first learned about multi-level cooling racks when I was a peeping at a total stranger's wedding registry (oh, you don't do this? Welcome to a new fun way to waste your time). What is this magical contraption, I thought, before ordering one immediately. The Nordic Ware rack is particularly convenient because it's stackable\u2014you don't have to have two tiers unless you need both\u2014and it's easy to assemble and disassemble (read: nothing like Ikea furniture).Now that I have one tiered cooling rack, I just might need two. Or three! That's six levels, people. That's so many cookies. I'll just need to get a second oven to keep up with my baking habit.Buy it: Nordic Ware Stackable Cooling Racks, $27 on AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
