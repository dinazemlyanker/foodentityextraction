Look at you, a put-together-person who baked something buttery, flaky, and heavenly and dressed yourself like an adult. It\u2019s like no one seems to realize how easy it is.It\u2019s almost as if humans have some evolutionary short-term memory block that prevents us from remembering how every single time puff pastry goes into the oven, it fills the kitchen with wafts of butter (wafts of butter!) and emerges, swelling its perfectly-bronzed chest. We\u2019re impressed no matter how many times we\u2019ve seen it before.Let me tell you a true story\u2014the facts, if you will. At a recent baby shower for a friend, where there were homemade cinnamon rolls (ahem, mine) and all of your typical egg-based brunch dishes (a lotta frittata and strata), as well as a bowl of Ruffles Original potato chips, what people really went wild for was the puff pastry my friend Ali brought: She simply rolled out a sheet of puff pastry, baked it, then covered the top (which bubbled up wildly in the oven) with a lemony herb salad.Puff the magic pastry.\nCond\u00e9 Nast EntertainmentIf you really want to, you can make your own puff pastry at home, but the frozen store-bought puff\u2014sometimes we splurge for the $$$ brand Dufour, but the more affordable Pepperidge Farm will also work\u2014is a reliable, consistent product that delivers those rich layers in a fraction of the time.With a box of frozen puff pastry, you have cheese twists, pandowdy, a fancy galette, and even a skillet pot pie at your fingertips. The power! The possibility!And while most recipes (and most wise people) would advise you to thaw the pastry in the fridge in its box overnight\u2026there is a workaround. When I forget\u2014which I inevitably do\u2014to transfer it from the freezer to the fridge, I put my puff pastry on a baking sheet, unrolled, then check on it in 10 minutes, at which point it\u2019s usually flexible enough to unfurl. After another 5, it will be good to go.Just like that, you\u2019re on your way to a puff pastry masterpiece that will put another friend\u2019s homemade cinnamon rolls to shame. Not that I\u2019m bitter or anything.Get the recipe:Spinach and Feta Tarte SoleilThe most impressive appetizer to \u201ccasually\u201d pull out of the oven when your friends come over (and it also happens to make a nice Thanksgiving snack for while the turkey rests\u2014just sayin').View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPuff Pastry DoughRecipes you want to make.
