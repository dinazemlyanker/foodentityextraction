Named for the Ohlone tribe indigenous to Northern California's East Bay, the cafe  is in a small backyard behind a local bookstore in downtown Berkeley. But in this small backyard, the cafe\u2019s founders, Vincent Medina and Louis Trevino are dreaming big. Representing, respectively, the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe and the Rumsen Ohlone community, Medina, 32, and Trevino, 27 have dedicated themselves to reviving native Ohlone foods through pop-ups, events, and now their first brick-and-mortar venture.Medina and Trevino have crafted a menu brimming with ingredients like acorn flour and venison that are rooted in Ohlone tradition. Many of these ingredients are gathered locally, in the company of the tribe\u2019s elders, while others are sourced from reliable locals. Without a formal culinary education, Medina and Trevino had to rummage through tribal notes and ask a lot of questions to arrive at the recipes they now serve at the cafe, which is open for lunch on Thursdays and dinner on Saturday, with additional hours to come.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t grow up eating our native foods; our parents didn\u2019t have access to them,\u201d says Medina. \u201cThere\u2019s a way to fix it, through hard work and carrying on in our families\u2019 footsteps.\u201d He sees the cafe as part of a larger global trend: \u201cIt\u2019s all part of the decolonization happening all over the world now,\u201d Medina says, \u201cWe\u2019re taking away the shackles and returning back to our ways.\u201dInstagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Trevino and Medina walked us through some of  the staple ingredients on the menu at Cafe Ohlone, which is available in both English and Chochenyo, the language of the East Bay Ohlone.Acorn flour: This is an Ohlone staple, and no meal is complete without it. To make acorn flour, acorns are gathered, often with the community, and peeled. The meaty central part is dried and ground into powder, which is then washed to clear the acorn of its tannic acids. Used in bread, soup, and porridge, the flour is a superfood, rich in proteins, monounsaturated fats, and carbohydrates.Venison: While many associate bison with Native American cuisines, venison, elk, and duck are what\u2019s native to the Ohlone. At the cafe, venison is wrapped in yerba buena and bay laurel and smoked in a smoker. For a recent tribal youth gathering, the two made venison and huckleberry sliders in chia flour buns, and the dish made it onto the cafe menu as well. \u201cIt\u2019s still our food, in modern form,\u201d Trevino says.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Bay Laurel: Present through the Bay Area and close to Ohlone villages locations, laurel has a lemony, sweet scent and medicinal and ceremonial properties. The leaves are used to infuse the cafe\u2019s sauces and stews, and the nuts inside the fruits are featured too. \u201cThey have natural caffeine, and we\u2019re big coffee people\u2014it\u2019s an adopted part of our culture,\u201d says Medina. The antioxidants-rich nuts are crushed and incorporated into truffles and an Ohlone twist on coffee served with hazelnut milk.Chia: Long before it became trendy, the Ohlone were roasting chia and incorporating it into breads and cakes. \u201cIt\u2019s full of Omega 3, vitamin B and fiber,\u201d says Medina. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those ingredients that make life good.\u201dYerba buena: This is a Californian type of mint, and,  according to the Trevino, \u201ca quintessential taste of home.\u201d Widespread in areas where Ohlone villages were once located, yerba buena is thought to reduce stress, and it flavors the cafe\u2019s stews and sweet sorbets.California Huckleberries: Dotting the cafe\u2019s sauces, salads, pancakes and meatballs, the tiny tart berries are native to East Bay\u2019s hills and are a \u201cgreat source of energy\u201d according to Medina. They are often incorporated into the Ohlone\u2019s spring and summer dishes.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishNative AmericanCaliforniaRead MorecultureBrit Reed Is Leading a New Generation of Indigenous ChefsBy Nicholas Mancall-BitelRecipes you want to make.
