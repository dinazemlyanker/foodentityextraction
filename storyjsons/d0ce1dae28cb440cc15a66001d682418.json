Published by Clarkson Potter/Publishers, an imprint of Penguin Random House LLC.EmailPinterestPrintEmailPinterestPrintMaking ribs at home can be sooooo intimidating. Pretty much every rib recipe involves hours of smoking or slow-baking and, in the end, I\u2019m saying, \u2018I could have just ordered these from Uncle Andre\u2019s.\u2019 (That\u2019s one of our favorite L.A. BBQ spots. #nospon #notpaidforthat.) Anyway, enter Pepper Thai with the perfect solution: Fry the ribs! These Thai fried ribs are so easy! Just a few ingredients and a few minutes and you have hot, juicy ribs with a soy-garlic-rubbed Thai twist. Fry some ribs for your next football party. Your friends will leave happy even if the other team scores all the home runs.\u00a0Reprinted from Cravings: Hungry for More. Copyright \u00a9 2018 by Chrissy Teigen. Published by Clarkson Potter/Publishers, an imprint of Penguin Random House LLC.Ingredients2\u20134 servings1rack baby back pork ribs (12\u201314 ribs), separated into individual ribs2Tbsp. soy sauce7garlic cloves, finely chopped1tsp. freshly ground black pepperVegetable oil (for frying; about 2 qt.)PreparationStep 1Place ribs in a large bowl. Add soy sauce, garlic, and pepper and toss to coat. Let stand at room temperature.Step 2Heat oil in a large heavy pot over medium-high until a deep-fry thermometer registers 370\u00b0. (Or test oil by throwing in a little piece of bread or some breadcrumbs; if they sizzle immediately but aren\u2019t burning, you\u2019re ready.) Working in batches, fry ribs until just cooked and well browned, 3\u20134 minutes. Return oil to 370\u00b0 between batches and try to skim out any stray bits of garlic so they don\u2019t burn in the oil and make it taste like burnt garlic.Step 3Transfer ribs to a platter and serve plain or with your favorite hot sauce alongside.How would you rate Chrissy Teigen\u2019s Thai Soy-Garlic Fried Ribs?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangle@siraphyn you can use www.bonappetit.com/recipe/spicy-thai-dipping-sauce/\nIt\u2019s a pretty standard Thai hot sauce, you can also substitute the Thai chili\u2019s for a Product: \nMomoya rayu chili oil with fried garlic \nWhich is really tasty and pretty spicy, that will give you the best \u201csauce\u201d to match that picture ChicChefAmandaAtlanta, GA 8/28/2020This looks amazing, however those measurements don't equal the amount of \"sauce\" in that bowl.
