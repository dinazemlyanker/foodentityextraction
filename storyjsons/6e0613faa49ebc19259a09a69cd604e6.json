But nowadays, other varieties of chile flakes are widely available. And that makes sense, considering there are so many varieties of peppers that can be dried and pulverized to make flakes. With so many types, it can be confusing to figure out what kind your dish requires, especially if you\u2019re new to the chile flake game.\u201cI'd never experienced [red] pepper flakes growing up in India,\u201d says Meherwan Irani, the founder of Spicewalla, a spice brand based in Asheville, North Carolina. \u201cNinety-nine percent of the time we use either whole chiles or ground chile powder, and there are [innumerable] varietals of red chiles. But in many other cultures, chile flakes [as opposed to whole chiles] are quite common.\u201dOf course, it would be impossible to talk about every single chile flake out there\u2014there are countless varieties, each with their own flavor profile and preferred applications. The chile flakes\u2019 flavor profile comes from how the chile peppers are grown and prepared.Some chiles, like your pizza parlor red pepper flakes, bring heat. Others, like the Korean staple gochugaru, offer a sweeter flavor. Since not all chile flakes are interchangeable, don\u2019t substitute willy-nilly. Understanding broad flavor categories (i.e., fruity, smoky, hot, sweet, mild) can help you choose the perfect chile for the dish you have in mind; plus, knowing what category of chile you need (as in, sweet as opposed to hot) means that you\u2019re more prepared to make a good substitution. There\u2019s nothing worse than expecting a sweet and fruity dish, only to have it be way spicier than you expected. Try tasting your chile flakes on their own before adding them to get an idea of flavor and heat.Here are a few types of chile flakes to incorporate into your own cooking:Gochugaru is a Korean seedless chile pepper that\u2019s been dried in the sun. According to food writer Eric Kim, gochugaru has a very powerful and sweet flavor. \u201cThey\u2019ve got this mellowness,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re not very spicy, but they add this real fruitiness and so much flavor to a dish\u2014not just heat.\u201dPhoto by Laura MurrayAside from being foundational in Korean cuisine, gochugaru\u2019s fruity flavor profile lends itself well to salad dressing, which is one of Kim\u2019s favorite ways to use it. \u201cI do a dressing of fish sauce, sesame oil, sugar, [raw] gochugaru, and some garlic and ginger,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not spicy and adds a lovely third note to whatever it is you\u2019re cooking.\u201dAnother popular chile flake is Aleppo-style pepper, which \u201cturns up the heat modestly but has some fruitiness and some earthiness to it,\u201d says Irani. Aleppo-style peppers are a star at SOS Chefs, a shop in New York City that sells gourmet spices, oils, and other ingredients. \u201cBecause it\u2019s so crunchy [rather than] powdery, it\u2019s something you can use differently than a chile powder and it has a lot of flavor,\u201d says Atef Boulaabi, the owner. Aleppo-style pepper is smoky and fruity, with cumin-like undertones.Photo by Alex Lau, Styling by Emily EisenAccording to Irani, \u201cThey\u2019re named after the eponymous city in Syria, and as you can guess, they\u2019re popular in Middle Eastern cuisines, from hummus to kebabs. But they\u2019re also fantastic in tagines and braised chicken and on roasted vegetables.\u201dFor those looking to add a bit more heat to their dish, guajillo flakes are a delicious option. \u201cThey have an earthy, grounding flavor,\u201d says Jocelyn Ramirez, founder of Todo Verde, a plant-based food business in L.A., and author of La Vida Verde. \u201cThey give you just enough heat to remind you that you\u2019re eating chiles without being overpowering.\u201dAnd there are countless other chile flakes not named in this article, like Fresnos, chipotle, cayenne, piri-piri, maras, Urfa biber, and so many more. There\u2019s a whole world of chiles flakes out there, ready for you to experiment with.One last thing to keep in mind: The flavor you get from a particular chile flake also greatly depends on how you prepare them. \u201cEspecially if you\u2019ve got a pepper with a lot of flavor and a lot of nuance, [how the chile flakes taste] depends on how you use them\u2014like if you sweat them [in fat] or if you just add them in the end,\u201d Boulaabi says. \u201cIt changes the whole perspective of your pepper.\u201dNext time you\u2019re thinking of cooking with chile flakes, investigate what they taste like, their origins, and how to reap the most flavor. That little bit of research will save you from the big glass of milk you\u2019ll need if you accidentally substitute crushed red pepper flakes for gochugaru the next time you\u2019re making dakgalbi.Speaking of dakgalbi:DakgalbiThe beloved Korean stir-fried chicken dish dakgalbi is spicy, sweet, aromatic, and comforting\u2014and it comes together in a few easy steps and one pan.View RecipeRebecca Gao is a Toronto-based journalist interested in climate, food, and late-aughts teen movies.
