I opened up Alfred, Lord Tennyson\u2019s famous poem about them, only to learn it wasn\u2019t about shallots at all, but some lady. Of Shalott. No relation. Boo!Shallots, as it turns out, are in the onion family: Allium cepa var. Ascalonium, to be exact. They grow from a bulb (called the mother) in clusters (the daughters!). I learned that shallots and other guys who make you cry when you cut them are called LACRIMATORS. Perhaps you\u2019ve dated one! But then the editor was like, \u201cI need you to write about things that are actually useful to home cooks.\u201d So here we are:What\u2019s the difference between a shallot and, like, a yellow onion?Shallots have a delicate  and sweet flavor with a hint of sharpness, while onions bring a more intense heat. You can substitute shallots in nearly any recipe that calls for onions\u2014just make sure you\u2019re using the same volume. (For example, several medium shallots equals about one small yellow onion.)Okay, I'm sold. How should I pick out the good ones?Shallots should feel heavy for their size and firm with dry, papery skins. Avoid any that are sprouted or have soft spots.There's our star!\nTed CavanaughAnd how should I store them?Kept in a cool, dark, and dry place (a.k.a. not in the fridge, where moisture lives), shallots will stay good for weeks.Help, there are so many ways to cut them! What do I do?Dice for vinaigrettes and pan sauces for a subtle, evenly distributed bite.Slice into rings for a raw, pickled, or fried garnish.Cut into matchsticks for an assertive, beautiful topping.Leave whole when you don\u2019t have time for knives. Best peeled and glazed as a side dish or roasted under a chicken.And how should I cook them?Go slow: Place 1 lb. large shallots (unpeeled and rinsed) on a rimmed baking sheet. Roast in a 425\u00b0 oven until skins are deep golden brown and a knife easily pierces flesh, 50\u201360 minutes. Let cool slightly, then slip out of skins. Chop and add to: yogurt (for chip dip, or fine, veggies), mayonnaise (for your new favorite sandwich condiment), vinaigrettes (for mellow, not biting, allium flavor), or mashed potatoes (for some extra oomph\u2014why not?).Christina HolmesPickled them: Quick-pickled shallots add acidity and crunch to salads and roasted veg. Here\u2019s how to make them: Toss 1 thinly sliced large shallot in a small bowl with \u00bc cup red wine vinegar, 1 Tbsp. sugar, and \u00bd tsp. kosher salt; let sit, tossing occasionally, 5 minutes.Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesFry them: If you don't want to do it yourself, buy them already fried. We love Maesri brand, which is easy to find online; buy in bulk because you\u2019ll be snacking on them right out of the container. Our test kitchen editors sprinkle them on breakfast tacos, soup, dips, and avocado halves.Photo by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiSteak salad, anyone?Steak Salad with Shallot VinaigretteCrusty, juicy sliced steak + a fully-loaded salad = what we want to eat most nights of the week, TBH.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titShallotOnionRecipes you want to make.
