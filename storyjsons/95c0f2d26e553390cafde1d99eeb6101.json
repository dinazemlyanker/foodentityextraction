I drank endless mugs of genmaicha and oolong, attempting to distract myself with warm liquids and unfamiliar blends. It wasn\u2019t as good as a tropical vacation, but it got me through March.I flirted with iced tea throughout summer, but now that I\u2019m officially back on bad terms with the weather forecast, I\u2019m re-upping my tea stash with sachets of yaupon, assam, oolong, and Bellocq\u2019s Canyon Chai.Usually, my qualification for a good varietal of tea is that it must have caffeine. (Going to bed early is not one of my virtues.) But I make an exception for Bellocq\u2019s light and sunny turmeric-based chai, which is lifted by a highly aromatic blend of rose hips, cardamom, ginger, and smoked black pepper. While it\u2019s not as punchy as your typical black tea-based masala chai, it\u2019s still spicy and floral\u2014and very good with a splash of oat milk (or whatever milk you prefer). And while I don\u2019t get that all-important jolt of caffeine after downing a cup, I also don\u2019t feel jittery if I follow up that cup with several more. That\u2019s a blessing, because this blend is good for two steeps per serving.Right now, my desk drawer is stocked with it, ready to answer the call of sniffly mornings, gloomy afternoons, and any other time I need a boost that doesn\u2019t come from an espresso machine. Still, I plan on bringing home at least a bit of the loose leaf blend to mix into hot toddies. If that\u2019s not a good winter preparedness plan, I don\u2019t know what is.Buy it: Bellocq No. 121 Canyon Chai, $17 at Bellocq TeaAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
