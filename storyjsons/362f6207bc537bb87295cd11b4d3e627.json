Delicious, to be sure, but I couldn't help but also picture heavy, gloopy batter and a gigantic pot of bubbling oil\u2014which is why I\u2019d mentally filed the treat under \u201cthings I enjoy but definitely won\u2019t be cooking at home.\u201dBut what if I told you that you could get a similar result\u2014golden, crispy shrimp\u2014without deep-frying it? Well, you absolutely can, and it only requires one pantry ingredient (cornstarch) and a few minutes in a (hot) pan. Yep, you heard that right!Using cornstarch to coat and fry foods is not a novel idea, but I never really believed in the technique\u2019s efficacy until I tried my mom\u2019s pan-fried shrimp which were, amazingly, crispy. Her method, similar to others, is simple and straightforward. All you have to do is give seasoned shrimp an even and thorough dredge in cornstarch, then cook them in a hot pan with just enough oil until the shrimp turns golden brown, flipping them halfway through. The result is shrimp with a crackly, barely-there coating and none of the hassle and mess associated with deep-frying.As uncomplicated as the overall technique is, each step is important to follow for best (read: light and crispy) results. While you\u2019re not deep-frying, you can\u2019t skimp on the oil, otherwise the cornstarch coating sticks to the pan. And if the oil isn\u2019t shimmering-hot, the shrimp won\u2019t cook properly. (I learned both the hard way, unfortunately.) But once I learned to avoid these pitfalls, I never looked back.I can\u2019t get enough of these simple-but-satisfying shrimp. They\u2019re a delicious addition to any manner of weeknight recipes, but paired with a zippy red cabbage slaw, toothsome farro, and a creamy, gochujang-spiked mayo\u2014as they are in this recipe\u2014they might as well be summer in a bowl. Now that I\u2019ve got this technique down, I\u2019m happy to report that crispy shrimp is something I both enjoy and cook at home. Armed with a bit of cornstarch and my trusty frying pan, I have everything I need.Get the Recipe:Crispy Pan-Fried Shrimp With Cabbage Slaw and Gochujang MayoAll the pleasures of fried shrimp without the hassles of deep-frying?
