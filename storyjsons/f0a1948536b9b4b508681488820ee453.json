It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.One of the seven fishesThere are many ways to participate in Feast of the Seven Fishes, the legendary Italian Christmas Eve sea creature celebration.There\u2019s the hardest way, in which at least seven fishes need to appear, a challenging and potentially exhausting undertaking that\u2019s only doable if you have a lot of cooks in the kitchen alongside you. (In my family, we\u2019re loyal to my mother\u2019s majestic menu, which takes three days to prep, and then my mom, my sister, and I cook all the courses for 16 of our closest friends. Everyone stays up until 3 a.m. and we need two days to recover.)Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!There\u2019s the medium way, which is good for people who are ambitious but not insane and just want to take the fishes for a spin. For these strategic-realistic folks, I recommend Andy Baraghani\u2019s achievable but still impressive dinner, which smartly combines make-ahead dishes, a hands-off, slow-roasted fish, and one \u00e0 la minute pasta.Photo by Chelsie Craig, styling by Judy ManciniBut for those of you who go all-out on Christmas Day and can\u2019t pull together a huge multi-course dinner party on the 24th, I\u2019ve got a mini-feast for you, and it\u2019s called clams on toast.That\u2019s right: Clams on toast. The recipe is from Hart\u2019s restaurant in Brooklyn, and it is like having linguine with clams except without the linguine. In place of the linguine, you get a giant hunk of fried bread, and instead of a sauce that clings to the noodles, you get a shallow bowl of herb-flecked, garlic-and-wine-infused, red chile\u2013studded broth, which you\u2019ll quickly realize is what the bread is for.Of course, there are also clams, one of the easiest and most forgiving of all of the fishes in the sea. As long as you buy small, fresh, hard-shelled clams (ideally littlenecks on the east coast, Manila clams on the west), you\u2019re off to a great start. Scrub the shells to dislodge any sand or grit, and throw out any with shells that gape open after you\u2019ve tapped them against your countertop (those ones are dead).The broth-sauce starts with olive oil, chopped pancetta, and garlic. Strictly speaking, The Feast is a fasting meal, so technically you shouldn\u2019t eat meat on Christmas Eve. (I find that hilarious considering you can quite literally enjoy seven courses of seafood during a fast, but that\u2019s one of the great things about Italian traditions.) To omit the pancetta, just add an extra tablespoon of olive oil to compensate for the missing fat. Then you add onion, fennel, white wine, bay leaf, some lemon zest, and ground fennel, which becomes the base for the clam steaming liquid. The clams go in with some more wine (use the bottle you\u2019re planning to drink with dinner). Once you throw a lid on that pot, the clams will steam, and when they\u2019re open, they\u2019re done. As their shells unhinge, the clams release their liquor into the sauce, which you will then sop up with your fried bread.This may amount to just one dish, but I believe it\u2019s special and flavorful enough to feast on. And if you eat at least seven clams, I think it ought to qualify.Get the recipe:Clam Toasts with PancettaExplore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterClamToastRecipes you want to make.
