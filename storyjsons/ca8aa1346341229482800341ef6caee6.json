The simple answer is: most of it.\u201d The acclaimed chef pulls no punches in his powerful new book on Hurricane Maria's aftermath.By Hilary CadiganSeptember 11, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto courtesy World Central KitchenFacebookTwitterEmailChef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s arrived in Puerto Rico five days after Hurricane Maria, on one of the first commercial flights to make it through. He found the tiny Caribbean island devastated: houses caved in, roads strewn with debris, electricity down, dead bodies piling up at barely-functioning hospitals.Yet here on the mainland, despite the fact that Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory populated by American citizens, little was being done. President Trump sent a few blustery tweets and headed off to his private golf club in New Jersey. FEMA, according to a federal report released this month, led a slow and disorganized relief effort marred by staff shortages and a lack of trained personnel. The Red Cross collected over $65 million from well-meaning donors, though it ultimately left more than half of that sum unspent. The Puerto Rican government\u2019s officially reported death toll hovered under 20 for weeks after the storm; according to a revised count released last month, it was 2,975.If you expected the James Beard Award-winning Andr\u00e9s\u2019s new book, We Fed An Island, to be a feel-good fluff piece, think again. Yes, there are happy moments: chefs singing while doling out steamy, belly-warming bowls of sancocho; neighbors rescuing each other from the floodwaters; schools and churches coming together to feed their own. On a shoestring budget made up mostly of private donations, Andr\u00e9s, local chef Jose Enrique, and their network of community kitchens managed to make and distribute more than three million meals to the people of Puerto Rico. But this book is a candid manifesto, brimming with righteous anger and holding to account those who should have fed the island, and didn\u2019t.\u201cWhat went wrong with the disaster relief in Puerto Rico?\u201d asks Andr\u00e9s in the concluding pages. \u201cThe simple answer is: most of it. When you see such epic failures, you realize these are systemic problems. The system failed from the top to the bottom, at every level of government, from federal agencies to nonprofit charities.\u201dWe caught up with chef Andr\u00e9s over email to talk more about what happened in Puerto Rico, what he learned, and how we can do better.As you mention repeatedly in the book, chefs can be some of the most crucial people on the frontline in crises like this one. Why?Chefs have a very specific and unique skill set: We are trained to feed people. In times of disaster, we\u2019ll find a kitchen, some ingredients, we\u2019ll gather the people to help, and food will be ready and available for everybody. Too many organizations don\u2019t see this. After a crisis, there needs to be medical care, electricity needs to be restored, houses rebuilt. So they\u2019ll bring in doctors, electricians, engineers. But when people need to be fed, they send MREs [readymade Department of Defense field rations low on flavor and fiber]? Chefs\u2014look us up, the Chef Relief Network of World Central Kitchen. We will put you to work!Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s wades through a flooded street to deliver a meal in Puerto Rico.\nPhoto courtesy World Central KitchenWhat was the biggest lesson you learned from your experiences in Puerto Rico?I think the biggest lesson is also the most simple one: When you find yourself up against a challenge, just start moving. Maybe it\u2019s not profound; it\u2019s not a lesson that will win a Nobel Prize, but it\u2019s a lesson that will make an opportunity out of a problem. If you try to tackle everything all at once, you will stall, you will freeze, you will have a meeting to establish another meeting because you are trying to come up with ways to postpone action. We didn\u2019t meet. We just began cooking. A thousand meals the first day, then doubled the number every day. Before we knew it we were at 150,000 meals a day! Break down big problems into smaller ones. You will be much more effective.In the book you mention \u201cdisaster boredom\u201d and \u201ccompassion fatigue,\u201d as growing problems in our current society, where we\u2019re bombarded with news of crises, political nonsense, and tragedy. What advice would you give when it comes to retaining our sense of humanity?I think the best way we can avoid getting overwhelmed and shutting down entirely is to get involved locally in our own community. There are opportunities all around us to support good work, and by starting those conversations, volunteering, getting active, we will see that there is good all around us. All of you\u2014everyone out there\u2014has a talent. Don\u2019t be shy, use it!Andr\u00e9s, Jose Enrique, and their fellow volunteer chefs dole out sancocho from a makeshift community kitchen in Puerto Rico.\nPhoto courtesy World Central KitchenYou and your fellow chefs sing a song as you cook in the community kitchens, with Spanish lyrics that translate to \u201cyou live like me, I live by cooking.\u201d Why did this become your anthem?These two amazing chefs, Roberto Espina and Rawi Leafar Yuri, were cooking at the Coliseum when some pleneros, street musicians, came and played for the chefs. They played a famous song, \u201cVoy Subiendo\u201d, which has the line \u201cTu vives como yo vivo, yo vivo vacilando\u201d\u2014\u201dyou live like me, I live by slacking.\u201d The chefs changed the lyrics a bit: \u201cYo vivo cocinando\u201d or \u201cI live by cooking.\u201d Literally and figuratively, so many of us live by cooking. It is in our blood, it is our passion, it\u2019s what we think about when we wake up and when we go to sleep.What have you been up to since you finished writing?There is no time for a siesta. Next we are opening the newest, most modern Jaleo [the sixth location of Andr\u00e9s\u2019s flagship Spanish restaurant] at Disney [World] later this year, and then we are going to New York in the Spring when we are opening Mercado Little Spain\u201435,000 square feet of Spanish food and culture. And we\u2019re hearing about some interesting opportunities for expanding our restaurants in Europe and Asia. And we will see what is next with World Central Kitchen. Never forget what Steinbeck wrote (with my slight edit), \u201cWherever there\u2019s a fight so hungry people can eat, WE will be there!\u201dBuy it: Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s's new book, We Fed An Island is $18 on Amazon.Photo courtesy EccoExplore Bon App\u00e9titJose AndresPuerto RicoBooksRecipes you want to make.
