On Passover we always make this potato and cabbage dish. Like many Ethiopian recipes it does not contain many expensive ingredients but is rich in flavor and texture. Somewhere between a soup and a stew, it\u2019s the perfect accompaniment to a larger meal with a meat component. The vegetables are roughly cut so that they maintain their shape and soak up the garlicky, spicy, gingery broth.\u201d This recipe will yield more of the spicy condiment awaze than you need, but you can use what\u2019s leftover in almost any other soup or stew, or mix it into mayonnaise to punch up your next sandwich. It even makes a great marinade for chicken or fish.Ingredients8 ServingsAwaze6medium red or green jalape\u00f1os, coarsely chopped1small dried chile de \u00e1rbol2garlic cloves11\" piece ginger, peeled, thinly sliced1cup (packed) cilantro leaves with tender stems1Tbsp. plus 1\u00bd tsp. extra-virgin olive oil2tsp.

(The flavor will get even better.)How would you rate Alicha Denich?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (6)Back to TopTriangleMy wife and I really liked this stew. It didn't seem too salty to us. I think that I cut up the potatoes smaller than suggested and they absorbed more of the salt. Really good flavor. I added a couple of tablespoons of coconut milk to a bowl of the leftovers the next day and that really upped the flavor.TracyOlympia, WA1/29/2022I loved this recipe! Definitely a bit too salty. But the flavor was amazing.Lindsey K6/16/2021It came out just right for me. \n\n1 TBSP salt was just the right amount, but I definitely weighed out all my food. 2.5 lbs of yukon potatoes came out to about 8 potatoes for me, and 2.5 lbs of onions were 3 large and 1 small onion for me. If you're not measuring weight, definitely salt to taste toward the end as opposed to doing the full 1 TBSP.\n\nLoved the flavors, it was just so well balanced across the board. Awaze is magic, and a new favorite of mine. We like things hot in this household so I added 2 serrano chilis as well, and it was just right. This stew with a thick cut of toasted sourdough just warmed my soul from the inside out. godsyllaLos Angeles, CA4/18/2021This was so delicious and comforting and even better the next day. Such a great balance of flavors and texture. I'll be adding this to my regular rotation of weeknight recipes. Not to mention the Awaze has become my new favorite condiment. AnonymousPhiladelphia, PA 4/8/2021Simple and yet very flavorful. The extra Awaze is great to have around.AnonymousNew York, NY4/8/2021I tried to rate this recipe 4 stars, but it defaulted to 5 and wouldn\u2019t let me change it. Now I\u2019m questioning all recipes on this website. This one was good, but WAY too salty. I used less than called for and it was still much too salty. Cut with vinegar and it helped. Will make again, but with 1/2 salt.
