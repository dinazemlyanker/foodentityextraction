They worked at J. Lohr Vineyard & Wines in Paso Robles, Gomez as the enologist and lab manager and Tarib\u00f3 as a cellar and barrel intern. After finishing her work in the barrel room, \u201cshe would come and disrupt the lab,\u201d Gomez says of Tarib\u00f3. Then one day, Gomez said to her, \u201cHey, you want to learn something? Follow me.\u201dUnsure, Tarib\u00f3 followed Gomez around the back of the winery to a small space where Gomez was making wine under her own label, Kalawashaq\u2019 Wine Cellars. Named for the village where her ancestors from the Chumash tribe once lived, this was Gomez\u2019s small, self-funded passion project. Working at J. Lohr paid the bills, but she\u2019d always wanted something that was her own. Gomez handed Tarib\u00f3 a beer from the fridge and told her, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s get to work.\u201dSoon Gomez was picking her up every morning at 4 a.m., before their shifts began at J. Lohr, to help with punchdowns (pushing the grape skins in tanks into the juice) at Kalawashaq\u2019. When Tarib\u00f3\u2019s internship ended four months later and she returned home to Catalonia, the two kept in touch, and years later, arranged to work at the same winery in the Spanish Pyrenees mountains, Castell d\u2019Encus. (Kalawashaq\u2019 Wine Cellars was put on hold.) They ended up visiting wineries all over the world together. Slowly, something started to blossom\u2014not just a working relationship but a romantic one.The 2020 Graciano, floral with a fruity finish\nPhoto by Zachary Gray\u201cThat\u2019s how we came up with the name for our own winery, Camins 2 Dreams. Camins means \u2018path\u2019 in Catalan, so it\u2019s \u2018the path to our dreams,\u2019\u201d Gomez explains. \u201cAll of the paths we\u2019ve followed have led us here to my hometown.\u201d Gomez still had the license for Kalawashaq\u2019, but the two wanted to focus on creating something new that represented both of them. After a whirlwind wedding and with additional funding from their parents, they were able to move the winery to Lompoc, south of Paso Robles, and rebrand it as Camins 2 Dreams, opening the tasting room to the public on June 21, 2019.Their winemaking style is very hands-off: They ferment with natural yeasts and don\u2019t do any fining\u2014adding agents to clarify the juice\u2014 or filtering. The result is wine that conveys a sense of place. Unlike many of their neighbors whose wines are chemical concoctions of colorings, added acidity, and gloopy gobs of Mega Purple, their wines represent terroir. They\u2019re truly Californian, with intensity coming from the striation of soils and exposure to sunshine, and freshness hailing from the cool climate of the unique transverse valley. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to understand a person until you understand where they come from,\u201d Tarib\u00f3 says. All of the best winemakers in the world recognize this important parallel, and the truly personal nature of Camins 2 Dreams has contributed to its cult following. The wines have been picked up by distributors in major cities like New York and featured in some of the city\u2019s most iconic wine shops and on wine lists of Michelin-starred restaurants, including the one I work at, Cote.Before the Camins 2 Dreams wines were even imported to New York, I\u2019d heard of Gomez and the vineyard land that the Chumash tribe had purchased in Santa Ynez through my husband, who was selecting fruit from the vineyards for his winery project, Railsback Fr\u00e8res. On my next visit to California, I reached out to Gomez and she graciously met me at the Lompoc tasting room for her tribe\u2019s wine, Kit\u00e1. Though the wines were delicious, it was this little side project, Camins 2 Dreams, that was electrifying. That was two years ago, and now it seems as if more of America has fallen in love with not only the wines but the women behind the project.Garnacha that Camins 2 Dreams will harvest soon\nPhoto by Zachary GrayWhile many neighboring wineries in Santa Barbara County are producing the easier-to-sell Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, Tarib\u00f3 and Gomez have hung their hats on more obscure varieties such as Graciano. It\u2019s a bold choice that speaks to their conviction to follow their own path, despite how difficult it is in the wine industry.Vineyard workers question their decision of when to pick the grapes, consumers make offhand comments about Indigenous people and alcoholism, and distribution in other markets is almost impossible to secure unless one is a part of the homogenous inner circle of wine. Tarib\u00f3 is used to the fight\u2014\u201cI come from a culture that\u2019s been fighting for independence from our Spanish neighbors,\u201d she says\u2014but acknowledges that this is nothing compared to what Gomez has faced. \u201cI just can\u2019t get a break,\u201d Gomez says. \u201cThe first thing people see is my skin color.\u201d Despite the opportunities she was given to attend private school and to study enology thanks to financial support from her tribe, Gomez felt alone. She was one of two women in the program and the only Indigenous person. \u201cI feel like a statue in a museum. That\u2019s how people perceive me, and it hurts,\u201d she says.Still, they are proud of their roots, and the path they have paved helps other marginalized groups find a way into the industry. Gomez and Tarib\u00f3 mentor several up-and-coming enologists, and many of them finally see themselves reflected. In the old boys\u2019 club of wine, it\u2019s rare to meet women in positions of power\u2014let alone two women married, one Indigenous and one who has immigrated, with their own business. As of 2020 just 14 percent of California\u2019s producers had a woman winemaker, according to a study by Santa Clara University. \u201cWe want to be able to represent and be a support group,\u201d Gomez says, \u201cto show people that we fought for this and look, we\u2019ve made it.
