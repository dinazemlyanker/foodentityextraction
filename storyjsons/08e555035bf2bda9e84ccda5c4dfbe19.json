Next up is artist Sharona Franklin, who uses gelatin to create otherworldy botanical sculptures.Growing up at the edge of the British Columbian wilderness gave 32-year-old artist Sharona Franklin an elemental connection to nature. \u201cI would just wander in the woods all the time and pick up plants like wild asparagus and burdock,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019d hunt rabbits, catch crawfish, collect freshwater clams, go fishing\u2026\u201dIn her teens, Franklin, who lives with over 20 rare complex systemic diseases, moved alone to Vancouver for medical care, and has since been developing an artistic practice integrating her love for nature with her experience of chronic disability. Among her current projects is @Paid.Technologies, an Instagram account where she posts images of her entrancing gelatin sculptures\u2014slick, semi-translucent works of varying edibility that can take days to create and begin to degrade the moment they\u2019re complete.\u201cWhen I started making art I wanted to show the more human aspects of living, and less this facade of design or aesthetics,\u201d Franklin says of her work. \u201cI really wanted to start talking about disability, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals\u2014a lot of my gelatin work is a shrine to cellular use of animals.\u201dInstagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Filled with prickly thistle, chrysanthemum, or hovering masses of champagne grapes, Franklin\u2019s psychedelic jelly worlds may seem thoroughly botanical. Yet by using animal-derived gelatin as her medium she protests one-size-fits-all wellness culture and references her own dependence on transgenic and stem cell-derived medication. \u201cI\u2019ve been met with a lot of pushback on gelatin, especially from vegan friends,\u201d she says, but \u201ceveryone has different needs.\u201dIn addition to exhibiting her work at galleries including Vancouver\u2019s 221A and Unit 17, Franklin writes about bioethics (her latest zine project, titled Mechanisms of Action, Injustice In Biopharm, was released by Cassandra Press at MoMa PS1\u2019s bookstore this fall) and runs Instagram accounts dedicated to disability awareness and fostering personal connections among the differently-abled.\u201cI feel empowered when I see other people sharing their experiences, and when people tell me my art or my experiences have helped them,\u201d says Franklin. \u201cI want to expand people\u2019s ideas of what disabilities entail, and I want to [encourage] a generative and collective community.\u201dInstagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.We talked to Franklin about the limitations of wellness culture, the sticky ingredient she\u2019s most excited to work with, and the power of domestic practices for the chronically ill.The era with the aesthetics I appreciate the most is\u2026 the seventies. And then I love the seventies revival in the nineties, because I grew up during that time and my older sisters were anarchist hippie punks and we would stitch smiley face patches on our jeans. I think I am drawn to the vocalness of that time.I love working with gelatin because\u2026 it\u2019s a medium I haven\u2019t seen experimented with enough, and it offers a lot of flexibility for three-dimensional sculpture and two-dimensional painting that doesn\u2019t damage the immediate environment.  Gelatin is biodegradable and it does not emit VOCs (volatile organic compounds) or asthmatic toxic chemicals, plus it doesn't end up in landfills or waterways and harm wildlife.My dream gelatin is\u2026 definitely interdimensional. I want it to be very large with a lot of different pockets and openings. And I want to make an extremely complex paper mach\u00e9 candelabrum to be inside of it.It is important to make art from my home...  because on top of the ill being stigmatized as \"un-useful in the home,\" we are often trapped there, seemingly further from a sense of professional accomplishment. So many people think, \"oh you\u2019re disabled you can\u2019t make things,\" or \"you can\u2019t produce,\" so it\u2019s kind of subverting that within disability. The fridge where my injections are kept is the same fridge where the jellies are kept.Right now I\u2019m learning about\u2026 perfumes. I really like essential oils so I\u2019ve been using lots of  frankincense, vetiver and clary sage lately. I got this Thierry Mugler perfume, its name in English translates to \u2018furious fern,\u2019 and it\u2019s kind of spicy and floral and powdery, but woodsy. It\u2019s my first perfume.I\u2019ve been listening to\u2026 binaural beats a lot. They\u2019re just really soothing.I find it helps with pain \u2014it\u2019s not a treatment or anything, but I find it just helps me focus and calm down my thoughts.I\u2019ve been watching\u2026 this show on Netflix called Girls Incarcerated. I think underage incarceration is an under-discussed issue.When it comes to strategies for coping with illnesses\u2026 I think community is the number one thing\u2014realizing you\u2019re not alone even if you feel isolated. I talk a lot with people online and we check in on each other if we know we have tests or we start a new medication or we have new symptoms.Watching wellness culture become a status signifier\u2026   has been very difficult for me. People with disabilities can get silenced [by the wellness complex]. People think, \"oh meditate and you\u2019ll be fine, do yoga and you\u2019ll be fine,\" when really those are just skills that make the pain easier to manage. They don\u2019t make your disease go away, not in my experience anyway.If I could give my young self one piece of advice\u2026 it would definitely be to believe in myself. Don\u2019t second-guess and doubt things, but continue to be open and find the right places and people that want to have the same conversations that I did.My skincare regime involves\u2026 a lot of snail gel! The CosRx 96% snail mucin is so soothing. I have redness, inflammation, so I use that. I really like yogurt masks with licorice root powder. I put rosemary oil or tea tree oil in my shampoo. I take a lot of baths with magnesium salts. And facial massage! I find that is really good for headaches and tension; it\u2019s surprising how much tension you hold in your face.The seasonal botanical I\u2019ve been really excited about is\u2026 sap.  Pine, birch and balsam sap are anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, and anti-bacterial, so I use them in a soothing topical balm I make. You can eat them, too. I\u2019ve been really wanting to make birch sap cookies and a gelatin. Sometimes I make jelly gummies with vitamin D, so I might make something like that.I want \u2026 a garden, very bad. I\u2019ve been wanting to grow edible flowers and hyssop for a really long time, because you can\u2019t really buy it for some reason. You can use hyssop  in tea but it\u2019s really good in jelly because it has a sweetness to it.I always crave \u2026 chocolate! I really like the Endangered Species chocolate. They donate to the Amazon Rainforest, and they have eco-friendly packaging and are fair trade. It\u2019s kind of a treat but they have a chocolate-mint one that I really like.Some artists whose work I admire\u2026 are Martine Symes and Kandis Williams.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishPerson of InterestInterviewsRead MoreLifestylePoet and Novelist Elizabeth Acevedo Fights Writer's Block With CurryBy Leigh-Ann JacksonRecipes you want to make.
