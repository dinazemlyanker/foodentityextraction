See, slowly cooking a protein in a flavorful sauce, letting it soak up flavor along the way until it reaches fall-apart tender perfection is my idea of culinary heaven. I like braising so much that, when I take a bath, I like to imagine that I\u2019m a chunk of short rib getting nice and loose with a generous pour of red wine. (Too personal?)I love braising because it\u2019s pretty much foolproof. There\u2019s no poking chicken breasts with meat thermometers, no stressing about whether the veggies will be flavorful enough, and\u2014once my leftovers are tucked away in the fridge\u2014there\u2019s usually only one pot to worry about cleaning. And braised dishes are the epitome of comfort food\u2014think tender oxtails, the juiciest possible chicken wings, and coconutty carrots with an unbelievable amount of flavor. It\u2019s pretty much universal: giving ingredients that much time to mingle nearly guarantees a delicious outcome.Of course, that time demand can be a pretty serious barrier to braising every night. Lots of braised recipes can stretch into hours, and while most of that time is usually spent waiting, I\u2019m not always down to have dinner at 10 p.m. on a Wednesday. That\u2019s why, when a new series of weeknight-ready braising recipes dropped in our September issue, my excitement reached an all-time high. This fall, I\u2019m done choosing between my impatience and perfection. Catch me braising my nights away with these recipes, all of which take an hour or less.Spicy Braised TofuThis riff on Korean dubu jorim from senior food editor Christina Chaey is easily the fastest of the bunch. Pan-fried tofu is given a massive flavor boost from a quick simmer in a bath of soy sauce, mirin, sesame oil, and gochugaru, creating something truly marvelous in about half an hour. Be sure to use extra-firm tofu so it doesn\u2019t fall apart and give it a good press to get rid of excess moisture before browning it. (You can do this with a couple of sheet pans, but a tofu press takes the hard work out of the process.) That also means more room to absorb flavor from the sauce and less stress about a jiggly mess.Spicy Braised TofuYou\u2019ll find a version of this quicker-than-quick dish on many Korean tables as a banchan, or small plate. But with rice and a side of greens, it\u2019s dinner exactly when you need it: right now.View RecipeWeeknight Rag\u00f9Not your nonna\u2019s rag\u00f9\u2014as in the kind that spends hours simmering on the range while the family helps her roll out fresh pasta by hand\u2014this sauce takes a shortcut to tender town by employing ground meat rather than big hunks. It also takes advantage of double-concentrated tomato paste to build a thick sauce in a fraction of the time. Finishing al dente pasta in the sauce is almost always a good call, and it\u2019s a no-brainer in recipes like this one\u2014two minutes in the rag\u00f9 and your noodles will be extra tasty and ready to serve straight out of the pot.Weeknight Rag\u00f9When you want the comfort of a meaty, cooked-all-day rag\u00f9 but don\u2019t have all day to cook one, reach for this speedier version.View RecipeSpiced-Tomato-Braised FishCooking whitefish like cod or haddock to tender, flaky perfection is a famously quick affair, so delicate fillets are perfect candidates for weeknight braising. \u201cSince fish cooks relatively quickly, the challenge is packing it with lots of flavor without overcooking it,\u201d says associate food editor Rachel Gurjar. The solution is packing the pot with sweet tomato pur\u00e9e, whole spices like cumin seeds and cinnamon sticks, and a healthy scoop of garam masala for good measure. Rachel recommends serving with big wedges of crusty fried sourdough, but any starch or grain you have on hand will do a fine job soaking up all that sauciness.Spiced-Tomato-Braised FishStore-bought tomato pur\u00e9e cooked with lots of warm spices such as cumin and garam masala packs tons of flavor into this simple fish curry.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
