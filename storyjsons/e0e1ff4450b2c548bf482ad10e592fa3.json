That\u2019s a bonus we\u2019re all about celebrating. From Boston to Brooklyn, Philadelphia to Seattle, we sought out some of our favorite neighborhood spots to share with you. So, next time you go to order lunch or dinner delivery from Caviar, try one of these local favorites and support female-owned and operated businesses while you\u2019re at it.Say \u201cYes\u201d to a Mouthwatering Plant-Based Meal from Philly\u2019s HipCityVegcaviarWhile people told Nicole Marquis she was crazy to open a vegan restaurant in the cheesesteak loving city of Philadelphia, she knew there was a demand for something a little different. It was actually her father that inspired her to open her plant-based fast-casual restaurant chain HipCityVeg\u2014when he was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes in 2009, Nicole helped him adopt a healthier diet with some of the same vegan smoothies and recipes that she made for herself. Skip to the opening of her first location in 2012; it was so popular she sold out of food by 1 PM! Now with 3 locations in Philly and one in Washington, DC, Nicole plans on opening more. If you haven\u2019t already, order and try one of their delicious smoothies, salads, wraps or veggie burgers. Our fave? The Bistro Bella, with herb-glazed, grilled portobello, dijon, olive tapenade, tomato, artichokes, red onion, and arugula.Boston\u2019s Asian Fusion Restaurant From An Ex Harvard Grad & Award Winning Pastry ChefCaviarBefore her career in the culinary industry, Joanne Chang graduated from Harvard with honors with a degree in Applied Mathematics and Economics\u2014hardly the prerequisite for her switching gears and becoming an award-winning pastry chef of Flour Bakery. After critical acclaim for her baked goods, Joanne opened Myers + Chang with her husband in 2007 and along with Chef Karen Akunowicz (who recently won the James Beard award for Best Chef Northeast) offer diners a very personal interpretation of Chinese, Taiwanese, Thai, and Vietnamese specialties. Locals in the South End love the restaurant\u2019s indie diner setting, but you can sample some of their tasty dishes via Caviar. Aptly named Tiger\u2019s Tears, this steak and herb salad has a chili-laden dressing that kicks up the heat in this spin on a traditional Thai dish.The Couple Who Created Their Own Favorite Date Night SpotcaviarWhen Tiah Hardy and her husband Jeremy couldn\u2019t seem to find a spot for an affordable date-night in Seattle, they dreamed up the idea of creating their own. Enter Mioposto, the Italian restaurant modeled after traditional Neapolitan pizzerias that first opened in Mt. Baker and now has a total 4 locations in the city. Tiah, the restaurant\u2019s Chief Food Officer, dreams up recipes and ideas for the menu with inspiration to keep it simple, source the best possible local ingredients, and cook correctly\u2014their open-flame ovens are the only heat source in the kitchen. She\u2019s also not afraid of flavor and creates consistently delicious small plates, entrees, and open-flame cooked pizzas. A highlight on their seasonal menu is the Zucca Balsamica Pizza with an olive oil base, roasted butternut squash, pancetta, mozzarella, caramelized onions, garlic, rosemary, goat cheese, red pepper flakes, and balsamic reduction. Bellissima!The East Village Middle Eastern Favorite with a Hip Williamsburg OutpostcaviarRivka Orlin was born in Mogador, Morocco (now known as Essaouira) before she and her Jewish family moved back to Israel. It was growing up where she discovered a love for sharing time with her mother in the kitchen. Fast forward twenty-five years when she moved to New York City, Rivka opened (what would become) one of the most-loved restaurants in the East Village, Cafe Mogador, with her brother. Now with an equally popular Williamsburg, Brooklyn outpost, fans of Orlin\u2019s delicious Moroccan-inspired cuisine can enjoy a menu full of dips, skewers, pita sandwiches and slow-cooked tagines with couscous. Next time you\u2019re ordering and want a healthyish lunch or light dinner, we\u2019re fans of the Tunisian Sandwich filled with house-made merguez (spiced lamb sausage), Arabic salad, tahini, and pickles served in a warm pita.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishCaviarSuperpoweredRecipes you want to make.
