Here, they're cooked with crisp chickpeas, then tossed with za'atar and\u00a0dressed with a mixture of ginger, jalape\u00f1os, miso, and tahini. This all-star dinner recipe will work long after corn has gone out of season. In winter, just sub shaved cauliflower or torn kale. This recipe is part of the 2020 Healthyish Farmers Market Challenge.

I made it as the recipe instructs- no substitutions.  I did choose the largest cloves of garlic I had and it ended up too garlic-ey.  I did not add any salt because the miso is salty enough for my taste.  If I made it again I would use less dressing.  So I recommend using the dressing sparingly.  I would also add sliced cucumber and a tomato from my garden.  And I might put it all in a pita to balance out the richness.  But overall a unique and delicious combo of ingredients.  While I don't regret making it, I would rather try something new than do this recipe again.KitchenetteOregon11/3/2021What if you don't like the taste of cilantro?AnonymousKnoxville Tennessee10/20/2021This review is for the tahini. I used it as a dressing for another grain + roasted veggie bowl I made and this dressing is SO SO SO GOOD. I swapped lemon for lime (cause that's all I had), used light miso, and used a combination of cilantro and parsley. My only mistake was keeping both jalapenos seeded (it ended up being very spicy), but I tempered it with some greek yogurt. IT WAS STILL SO GOOD. THE BEST DRESSING I'VE EVER HAD.SmitaMinneapolis, Minnesnowtah10/2/2021This is just outrageously delicious, and we\u2019re not even close to vegetarian.  Definitely going into the regular rotation.NikkiRhode Island9/16/2021This recipe is phenomenal! The flavor is something that is not to be forgotten. Few recipes have stuck in my memory like this one. A year after being introduced and I\u2019m still making this at least once a month. I\u2019ve skipped on the ginger and jalape\u00f1o before and it\u2019s good, but I prefer the dish as is with all the ingredients. I think it\u2019s vital to get yourself a good fresh cheese. Bulgarian sheep\u2019s milk feta is my go to but I could also see some queso fresco going well. I also think a lighter miso works much better with this dish than dark red miso. I found the dark miso to overpower the dressing. Thank you, Chris Morocco! AnonymousSanta Cruz, CA6/30/2021Absolutely \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25!!!!! Super fresh and summery. I added some avocado and queso fresco for the final bowl and it was super delish! I can see myself munching on this for the whole summer. I did cut back on the pepper for the dressing and added more garlic than the recipe suggested. JillChicago, IL6/16/2021I changed up the dressing after reading some of the reviews. Instead of jalapeno I added two small pickled sweet peppers, about half of a lime,  instead of 1/3 of a cup like the recipe suggests.  I also added water and miso to taste and didn't add salt. Was so delicious. I think the miso, jalapeno and lime and salt was overwhelming. Oh, and I also only used 3 tablespoons of tahini but kept the same amount of cilantro and added about 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil. RosesOakland, CA6/7/2021This was very tasty, but the dressing was a bit too salty and garlicky for me. It needed some sweetness, so I ended up adding some (maybe a tsp?) of honey to the dressing and some quick pickled carrots (leftover from Christina Chaey's summer grain bowls!) to the salad and I felt like it really balanced everything out. MelissaBrooklyn1/12/2021A new family favorite for adults and children alike with only one minor modification, which was one less garlic clove in the dressing. A surprising combination of flavors that come together incredibly. ChristinaBrooklyn, NY1/6/2021Loved this! I had my doubts because it\u2019s a strange mix of flavors and the sauce on its own is very strong, but it all really comes together! BethGlenside, PA12/15/2020Layered and wonderful. A great summertime dish. Highly recommend.AnonymousLos Angeles10/12/2020I made this, in part, because we happened to have almost all the ingredients on hand remarkably\u2014miso, tahini, jalape\u00f1os, corn, ginger, even za\u2019atar! Never in my wildest dreams could i have predicted how much my husband and I would love it. Will definitely make this again. AnonymousBrooklyn, NY9/15/2020So good. I also had about a cup of leftover dressing that I will happily use on my next salad. KatiehwalshAustin9/13/2020Love me a good Chris Morocco miso-tahini-veggie-fusion-splosion of a recipe but I just didn't love this one and can't see myself making it again. AnonymousSeattle 9/12/2020Wow.  I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect, but this was absolutely delish!  I used red miso, and some Peruvian chili lime spice mix.  So tasty!  I\u2019m out of lettuce now, but looking forward to having the leftover dressing and corn/chickpea mix over kale for my lunch tomorrow.AnonymousCalifornia9/2/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titRice and Grain BowlCornVegetableChickpeaBeanMisoCondiments, Sauces & PastesTahiniJalape\u00f1oChileSummerQuickEasyWeeknight MealsMainVegetarianHealthyishSaut\u00e9LunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
