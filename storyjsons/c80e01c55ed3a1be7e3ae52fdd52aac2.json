It\u2019s debatable, but we do know that this is a healthyish wedge salad recipe we\u2019d happily make every day. It\u2019s got the rich part\u2014a creamy tahini dressing that\u2019s so thick it anchors the greens. It\u2019s got the crunchy stuff\u2014seeds and coarse salt. And it\u2019s got freshness\u2014actual lettuce and herbs.

The herbs, the seeds, the dressing, thank you! AnonymousJersey city 11/28/2020Absolutely OBSESSED with this salad.  Started making it during quarantine and have made it at least 11 times since - always a hit!  I follow the directions (and strongly advise that you do), I just go a bit heavier on the tahini (as I love it), add some lemon zest and a touch more lemon than it calls for, and go slightly lighter on the white wine vinegar.   I advise doing a mixture of herbs (I love using Parsley & Basil) and for the seeds - black sesame, regular sesame, flax, everything bagel seasoning, & even some crisped quinoa.  AMAZINGGGGG.Anonymousbrooklyn, ny10/30/2020I love this is a delicious twist on a classic.   Fresh, garlicky, and yummy. lgwmooKensington, MD5/4/2020I just made the dressing, with some slight modifications for a different salad, and it was lovely! I added a little bit of extra tahini, and I replaced the chives with green onions, and I used cilantro in place of the other herbs, because that was all I had. I mixed the herbs directly into the dressing, and it was quite thick, so I added quite a bit of water to thin it out (almost half a cup). I added what I thought was an adequate amount of salt, but when I tasted it, it wasn\u2019t quite right, so I added way more salt than I typically do for other vinaigrettes, and it was perfect! So if you don\u2019t have a problem with salt, don\u2019t be afraid to add more than you think you should!Ellen LittleCharlotte, NC, USA11/13/2019could legit eat a bathtub full of this salad! Unreal how good this is. Aleppo pepper dayuummmmm. I did poppy, sesame and toasted pepitas and it's killer. kmarxmarxchicago4/10/2018I actually just used 4oz. yogurt, 2 TBLS tahini 1 clove garlic, 1/2 lemon juice, and a pinch or so of the herbs. Mixed and let it chill. In a bowl I put some left over chicken breast, chopped red delicious apple, chopped in 3rds a few sweet pea pods. S&P. Kind of like a tahini  chicken salad.\nYum!!AnonymousConcord, NC3/31/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladLettuceLeafy GreensVegetableTahiniCondiments, Sauces & PastesQuickEasyWeeknight MealsSideVegetarianGluten-FreeKetoHealthyishHanukkahDinnerRecipes you want to make.
