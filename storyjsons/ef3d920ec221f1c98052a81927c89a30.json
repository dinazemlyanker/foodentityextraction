Verdant and green, orchards and vineyards extend in every direction. In the distance, the fast-moving waters that plunge over Niagara Falls crash down with awe-inspiring, ferocious intensity. But much of what makes this green corner of the world special is actually underneath it. Translation: The soil here is special. Although the wine industry in the Niagara Region is relatively young\u2014serious winemaking here dates only to the 1980s\u2014the area is smack-dab in the middle of an ancient glacial plain, which over thousands of years has enriched the soil with pockets of different minerals and nutrients. This means that the terroir of one vineyard can wildly differ from another\u2019s just down the road. In other words, if you\u2019ve tasted one Niagara wine, you most certainly have not tasted them all.The natural forces that produce Niagara Region\u2019s great wines also make for breathtaking natural scenery, which is why the best way to experience it is on a bicycle. The country roads that link some of the area\u2019s best wineries are relatively flat, so cycling between them is a breeze. If you\u2019re worried about drinking and biking, don\u2019t be: Responsible cyclers either take modest sips or learn how to spit, which when done properly, can actually help you taste wine better. Plus, if you really dig some of the wines you\u2019ve tried along the day\u2019s journey, you don\u2019t have to hold a bottle under your arm as you try to keep your bike steady. Many wineries in the area will arrange to have a bottle sent directly to your hotel, and we can\u2019t think of a better reward for a day of cycling than a glass of your favorite new Niagara Region vintage.Maria SainteWhether you rent your own bike or join up with one of the wine region\u2019s many bike tours, these are the stops you can\u2019t miss on an epic cycle through the area.Jackson-Triggs WineryA fantastic starting point for your cycle around town is the modern Jackson-Triggs Winery. The airy, glass-enclosed main building overlooks roughly 12 acres of finely manicured vineyards, with two-story-tall, garage-style doors that roll up on clear and sunny days to let in a gentle cross breeze. It\u2019s a gorgeous and open space that marries contemporary and traditional architecture, and you might be tempted to linger here all day. Nosh on tacos, cheese, and charcuterie at the on-site cafe, The Patio, or grab a glass of Sauvignon Blanc (or Pinot Noir, or Merlot, or any of Jackson-Triggs\u2019s other delightful offerings) and hunker down in the winery\u2019s 500-person-capacity amphitheater, which is built into the hillside of the vineyard. Don\u2019t leave without walking around the grounds; if you\u2019re lucky, you might glimpse grapes being crushed on the outdoor \u201ccrush pad.\u201dTwo Sisters VineyardsFrom Jackson-Triggs, cycle past grassy fields lined with towering, leafy trees and through Niagara-on-the-Lake\u2019s historic old town. As you roll up to the estate of Two Sisters, scope out its towering pillars and grand, symmetrical windows; they\u2019re inspired by Renaissance architecture and the founders\u2019 roots in Italy\u2019s Campania region. The wines here, though, are all Niagara. Drop into the moodily lit tasting room for sips of the winery\u2019s small-production reds like Merlot, Cabernet Franc, and Cabernet Sauvignon, which helped earn Two Sisters the Best Performing Small Winery of the Year award from WineAlign\u2019s National Wine Awards of Canada in 2018. Pro tip: Take the Experience Tour and try a handful of vintages directly from French oak barrels in the winery\u2019s candlelit cellar. Afterward, hang out on the outdoor patio at Kitchen76, the property\u2019s Italian-inflected bistro. We\u2019re into the house-made pizzas like the Dolce e Salato pie, a sweet-and-savory creation piled high with creamy mozzarella, pungent gorgonzola, slices of pear, prosciutto di Parma, toasted walnuts, arugula, and honey.Peller Estates Winery & RestaurantAlthough it\u2019s practically next door to Two Sisters, Peller Estates feels like it\u2019s in another country altogether. Specifically, France. You\u2019ll find Peller down a tree-lined private road that leads to a massive French-inspired ch\u00e2teau, which rises magnificently before you. Don\u2019t be intimidated, though: Some well-heeled diners dress to impress at the on-site Winery Restaurant, an elegant dining room with crisp white linens and twinkling chandeliers, but plenty of visitors hop off their bikes dressed more casually in cycling gear. (If you\u2019re here for lunch, pair Peller Estates\u2019 French-oak-aged Chardonnay with the fresh lobster linguine draped in Chardonnay-spiked cream sauce and slivers of black truffle.) Don\u2019t leave without dropping in on the property\u2019s Greatest Winery Tour, which grants visitors entrance to 10Below, the chilly downstairs lounge where everything\u2014from the seats to the bar\u2014is made with blocks of ice. Once inside, you\u2019ll be provided with a heavy winter jacket and a glass of ice wine made from late-season Riesling and Cabernet Franc grapes.InniskillinA short way down the leafy Niagara Parkway, which hugs the banks of the mighty Niagara River, you\u2019ll come upon Inniskillin, one of the oldest wineries in the area. The specialty here is Icewine, which is made from Vidal, Riesling, and other grapes that have been left to mature on the vine into the winter season. The result is a decadent, sweet wine with a concentrated, nectar-like flavor. Take a guided tasting inside Inniskillin\u2019s restored 1920-era barn or post up on the property\u2019s sprawling red brick patio, where on weekends, more than 200 cyclists a day will chill out at picnic tables shaded by large red umbrellas. Ice wine isn\u2019t just for dessert\u2014it can also stand up to the hearty, unctuous fare from the property\u2019s walk-up Market Grill. Specialties include sandwiches brimming with tender 16-hour-smoked brisket, maple syrup pulled pork, and pulled chicken doused with ice wine-infused barbecue sauce. Make sure to leave room, though, for the fresh Malpeque oysters and gooey poutine.Caroline CellarsThere are roughly 40 bikes parked outside Caroline Cellars at any given time, and with good reason. Even with 20-foot-high ceilings, the dining room of the winery\u2019s Farmhouse Cafe feels warm and cozy thanks to the building\u2019s handsome Canadian pine paneling and homey, seasonally driven menu. Park your bike outside (or, if it\u2019s an e-bike, recharge it at the property\u2019s charging station) and settle in for rib-eye steak sandwiches and juicy sirloin burgers made with local meat, focaccia sandwiches stuffed with grilled golden beets and summer vegetables, and tacos conveying fried nuggets of local Lake Erie pickerel. Wash it all down with a sip of Caroline Cellars\u2019 house-made wines, which in addition to the usual reds and whites, include vintages made with local plums, cranberries, and blueberries.Stratus VineyardsFeeling the burn in those quads? You\u2019ve cycled a giant loop, and you\u2019re nearly back to where you started. Sleek and minimalist, the glass-and-concrete tasting room at Stratus Winery\u2019s LEED-certified facility\u2014the first of its kind in the world\u2014is filled with light all day long. It\u2019s only a small part of the entire estate, which spans a staggering 62 acres filled with 16 different grape varieties, from Petit Verdot and Sangiovese to Syrah and Tannat. Walk up to the long marble bar for a casual tasting, or pop into the property\u2019s petite, mesquite-wood-lined tasting room and pair Stratus vintages with local cheeses, dark chocolate, and sea salt shortbread. Afterward, bring your glass out to the couches on the large stone patio in back, which overlooks vines as far as the eye can see. The view is stunning, especially at sunset, making it the perfect place to conclude a long day of cycling.Additional stops to consider:Reif Estate WineryMarynissen Estates WineryWayne Gretzky Estates WineryTrius Winery & RestaurantBig Head WinesNo matter if you choose to hit up one winery or a half dozen, cycling past rolling fields of vineyards and never-ending greenery is an unparalleled experience\u2014one that simply can\u2019t be recreated in a car. After all, wine tasting in the Niagara Region is all about lingering, whether over a glass of crisp Riesling or a dusty country road. The joy is in the journey.Recipes you want to make.
