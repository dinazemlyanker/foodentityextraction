It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Alex LauA moment of silenceRest in peace, dear Dorcas Reilly, inventor of the green bean casserole. Let\u2019s toast a can of cream of mushroom soup in honor of the woman whose vision not only saw how a soup could bind a pot of green beans, but topped the whole thing with crunchy fried onions. Reilly worked in the Campbell\u2019s test kitchen and loved cooking so much that after a full day of developing recipes, she\u2019d go home and cook some more\u2014a lot of soup, according to her husband. While our recipe gets a little bougie with homemade mushroom b\u00e9chamel, the French\u2019s fried onions on top stay true to the 1955 original. According to Campbell\u2019s, over 20 million homes will serve green bean casserole on Thanksgiving, which is an incredible culinary legacy to leave, if you ask me.Want this letter before it hits the website?

Meaning perfectly salted. A zombie slouched over the ATM. On our drive home, we passed a house with a skeleton family arranged in a barbecue scene, with a plastic baby on a Weber grill, and my appreciation for Halloween decor has never been surpassed. Suddenly I\u2019m craving some popcorn balls.Courtesy of NetflixSpeaking of spookyI\u2019ve been watching The Curious Creations of Christine McConnell on Netflix, a freaky scripted cooking show about a woman who sculpts edible art and her motley crew of misfit muppet housemates. At first I thought all of the Sudafed/NyQuil I\u2019ve been taking was to blame for how weird the show was, and then I realized nope, it\u2019s just a very weird show. I love every minute. The pastel, vintage Pyrex-stocked kitchen and McConnell\u2019s spotless wardrobe contrast against the hairy, bloodthirsty, but lovable creatures who live with her, my favorite being the chocoholic raccoon with a fork for a paw. Yep. I\u2019m entranced by her sculptural skills, the hours and adept (human) hand it takes to make a realistic Ouija board cookie out of shortbread and molten hot isomalt (to make the hardened, polished finish), airbrushed to resemble antique mahogany. She deep-fries werewolf paw doughnuts in a smoking cauldron on her stovetop. McConnell\u2019s character is like Stepford Wives meets Witches of Eastwick, soft-spoken with a hint of evil, something to aspire to, really.Alex LauBread of the deadRick Martinez\u2019s sweet and fragrant pan de muertos\u2014Mexican Day of the Dead bread\u2014is a lot easier than McConnell\u2019s ouija board, if you\u2019re looking for a sweet to get in touch with your ancestors. It\u2019s a tender, eggy dough spiced with anise, orange blossom water, and rich with a stick and a half of butter.Food meme of the weekI\u2019m chaotic neutral.Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensMeat me upI need this meaty kielbasa stew like a roaring fireplace and flannel underwear. All. Winter. Long. Serves 14. \ud83d\ude2eUnnecessary food feud of the weekThere are some candies you only see around Halloween. People have strong feelings about these candies. Poor snaggle-toothed candy corn, it never stood a chance for year-round glory! Who the hell is Mr. Goodbar? Why are Almond Joys so good? \u201c@abeggs obviously you\u2019re out of touch with America,\u201d said Carla Lalli Music. \u201cNever heard of a SNICKERS???\u201d Touch\u00e9. \u201cHow can you sit here and disrespect Reese\u2019s like this?\u201d replied Aliza Abarbanel. \u201cMilk duds = the duds,\u201d womp-womped Sarah Jampel, respecter of molars. \u201cMounds are so much better than Almond Joy what the heck @abeggs,\u201d Kate Fenoglio piled on. \u201cHalloween is the one time of the year I eat a Butterfinger,\u201d Sasha Levine typed through slippery fingers. \u201cI want to know the psychopaths who walk among us who call them \u2018Reesie\u2019s Piecies\u2019\u2019 Christina Chaey whispered. \u201cI once made Halloween decor of Reese Witherspoon and Reese\u2019s products,\u201d Alyse Whitney shared. And with that image in mind, I\u2019ll quietly step out now.Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
