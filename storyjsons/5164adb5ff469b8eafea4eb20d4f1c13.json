But that's not all! It also comes together in just over an hour and, thanks to all that frozen spinach, delivers enough veggie goodness to justify eating a big pan of baked pasta on a Tuesday. If you don't have a cast-iron skillet, don't sweat\u2014any sturdy, similarly-sized pan that has a heatproof handle will work almost as well here.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

If you don't have any clean kitchen towels, you can also squeeze water out of the spinach by hand one small handful at a time, or press it in a fine-mesh sieve.

Don't hate me, I added meat - I cooked up a lb of grass fed ground beef with the onions and garlic in the beginning. Also, don't hate me, I used a jar of tomato sauce instead of the crushed tomatoes - Raos. I think my jar was 32 oz so it was actually slightly too little (there are 3 14.5oz cans crushed tomatoes called for) and it still came out fine.   This was my first attempt at lasagna and I would definitely do this recipe again. I'd make the veg version, and I'd also do a version with Italian sausage. Oh! And I used fresh spinach that I saut\u00e9ed and then used paper towels and a heavy water pitcher on top to press the water out of, instead of frozen bc I had spinach to use up, and that worked out great. Thanks Basically - always enjoy your recipes! AnnaleePhilly11/15/2020Well\n\nCast iron pans and dutch ovens scratch ceramic top stoves so other than that, it is a great recipe Santos SanchezBritish Columbia 11/13/2020Instead of a cast iron, I went with a dutch oven and it resulted in a delightfully tall lasagna. Great flavour and tons of food. Will absolutely be making it again. AnonymousCanada9/1/2020Loved this recipe. I should know because I\u2019ve been eating leftovers of it for like a week! This recipe makes a ton of food and tasted delicious, even after a week in the fridge. Took a little bit of time but tasted really really good. If your cast iron is seasoned the tomatoes. shouldn\u2019t be a problem.  Great recipe for a party. AnonymousNew York City 7/27/2020This lasagna is full of great flavor, the sauce is amazing and it does not take long to make at all. I used San Marzano crushed tomatoes and they made for a delicious sauce. I cooked my sauce in a dutch oven and assembled the lasagna in a glass baking dish because I do not own any cast iron, and it turned out great! This is an easy peasy recipe that I will make again and again. AnonymousOhio, United States12/9/2019This is such a good, basic vegetable lasagna recipe. No frills and takes significantly less time than a classic lasagna. I will admit the million comments warning against tomatoes in cast iron made me wary but since my cast iron is well seasoned there were no problems. I think if your cast iron skillet is not seasoned well enough to make this recipe, you should consider re-seasoning your skillet for the sake of everything you make in it.AnonymousIndiana, USA11/19/2019Why on earth use canned tomatoes? Its SO EASY AND QUICK to simply pour boiling water on fresh, ripe tomatoes whose skin has been slit. Then you rinse them under cold water and the skin comes off easy. Takes about 15 seconds per tomato. Then all you have to do is cut them and use them as required in the recipe. Believe me, the taste is better and sweeter than any tinned product- without the industrial after-taste. Worth the slight effort.\nAnonymous4/14/2019Exactly what I expected good veggie dish followed directions very good dish. seasonings could be turned up a bit.. basically wonderful!topdriverLake Orion Michigan 4/11/2019Really good, fast, and basic veggie recipe. I love the ricotta/spinach mixture - it's like eating spinach dip in pasta. It's especially good with homemade ricotta. I also used some of those kinda scary no-cook lasagna noodles, which worked out well (I think they soak up some of the excess moisture in the tomato sauce) but would've been better in a rectangle dish. I think if your cast iron is seasoned and oiled well enough it's not a problem - mine is still in great shape. Looking forward to leftovers for my lunches this week!AnonymousColorado4/1/2019So all the other comments had me scared to cook it in cast iron so I made the sauce in a nonstick skillet and assembled and baked the lasagna in a 13x9 ceramic dish. I ended up needing one extra noodle so I would recommend boiling a couple extra. If you have the room I recommend pulling the noodles out of the cooking water individually and laying them flat on some sheet pans because if you drain them into a colander they noodles will take on weird non flat shapes that aren\u2019t conducive to lasagna. Overall very good vegetarian recipe. AnonymousTX3/31/2019This is your basic spinach lasagne recipe, which is always good. I used half cottage cheese/half ricotta and Aleppo in place of black pepper. \n\nWhile my cast iron skillet occasionally attains the state of seasoning acceptable for cooking tomatoes in, it is prone to seasoning recidivism in my house so I never cook tomatoes in it: The tomatoes impart a metallic taste to the food. (I grew up with this taste from my mother's cooking.) Drives me nuts to see photos of shakshuka cooked in cast iron, and while I'm at it, cooks using metal utensils in porcelain lined cast iron cocottes. I ruined my first one this way. Leta RogersSF Bay Area3/30/2019@ anonymous: tomatoes do not mix well with iron. iron blackens the sauce and tastes awful. but suit yourself. i just wouldn't do it or eat it. recommended skillet: either enameled cast iron or stainless steel. btw, i like your slip: should for shouldn't. PB-CUPNYC3/23/2019As long as your pan is properly seasoned, the acidity of the tomatoes should damage the pan and leach too much iron. Just dont make it in aluminum - that would truly be bad. Some people actually swear by cast iron with anemia, for the very small amount of iron that can be obtained.AnonymousChapel Hill, NC3/21/2019This is a solid easy recipe as is.  Add ground beef or Italian sausage for carnivores! \nSIDE NOTE:  How many people HATE the word \"basically\"?rckcsgrvPacific City Oregon3/20/2019Ingredients and technique generally look great but tomato definitely reacts with cast iron so one must find alternative pan. Gonna hafta vote newp on this, BA should know better. BTW, love those spatulas shown in the video: silicone with wooden handle. Unfortunately it is not the spatula pictured in equipment, and the link from there doesn't even lead to either of those spatulas. Oh, BA my foot!
