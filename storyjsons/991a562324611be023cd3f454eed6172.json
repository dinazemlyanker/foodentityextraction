I think peanut chutney is terrific as an accompaniment for bready dippers like idli. butter toast would be fine too, it needs something to soak into. You just need a small smear, no need to make cups and cups of this recipe.Anonymous5/25/2021This is ok and I\u2019ll eat it an serve to guests, but won\u2019t make again. Note this makes only 3/4 cup, so it\u2019s very fussy to scrape that small amount out of the bottom of your blender. Flavor is fine, nothing to write home about, even after adding some extra lime and salt. Cilantro/lime is my favorite flavor combination, but this still didn\u2019t do much for me.Jackie MMadison, WI11/27/2020Very flavorful and has a lot of heat. I added more peanuts and cilantro with about a half cup of greek yogurt to make the texture smoother and tone down the spice a bit\nAnonymousIL5/31/2019Doesn't taste like peanuts, doesn't taste like cilantro, doesn't taste like ginger. The end results is less than the sum of its parts. Very bland. Not worth the effort. chickenfogNorthern California4/1/2019This is a great combination of flavors.tuscantableMinnesota3/26/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titCondimentChutneyDipCrudit\u00e9IndianSouth AsianAsianPeanutNutCilantroHerbs & SpicesEasySnackStarterVegetarianDairy-FreeGluten-FreeVeganHealthyishDinnerRecipes you want to make.
