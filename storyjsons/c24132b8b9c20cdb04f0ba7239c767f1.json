My partner said the meal was \u2018meh\u2019 the first night then was blown away by the flavors the next day. AnonymousLos Angeles8/15/2021Great combination of flavors and textures. I had leftover wild rice to use so was a quick fix Nancy RybaskiLyndon Station,WI6/21/2021I love this shrimp bowl. It is a tasty meal, perfect for summer. I am always looking for flavorful recipes that can be easily made for one. I halved the recipe, had enough for a second meal, so I stored the shrimp and rice together and microwaved on medium for 1.5 minutes, threw on the orange and cucumber mixture and poured the dressing and it was as good as the first time. Sweet, bright, smooth and creamy from avocado and crunchy cucumbers. Love it.KayeMinneapolis6/14/2021Nah. Not that good. Very Carribean flavor and in keeping with that, I would lose the Sriracha and substitute fresh diced jalape\u00f1os or serranos. Will avoid recipes by this writer.AnonymousCalifornia 6/1/2021The flavors are wonderful and it's easy to make. Will be making this again and again.AnonymousSt Paul MN4/23/2021So, it seems like the orange juice in the recipe is not to be taken from the 2 large oranges that are listed in the recipe?  If that's the case, the recipe should probably call for 3 oranges.  Andrew D.Brooklyn, NY3/15/2021OMG. So simple, so quick, healthy and delish! The flavors were light and refreshing, the crisp crunch of the cucumbers and bite of the citrus, so amazing. I could eat this every day. AnonymousChicago, IL11/18/2020HELP!  We love this recipe, in fact planned to make it today when my husband awoke with a gout attack brought on by a weeklong binge on oranges.  What can I make with these ingredients and a moderately stocked pantry but without citrus?nbspRio Rancho NM6/5/2020This was such a great recipe! Had all the ingredients for the marinade on hand already and I think this marinade would be great on any protein (chicken, steak, tofu) in addition to shrimp.  I used BA's perfect pot of rice recipe for the rice (turned out perfectly) and added some peppers and carrots to the citrus salad.  Flavorful, a little spicy, and delicious!Anonymous5/21/2020This was refreshing and surprisingly hearty. The citrus was bright and kinda hot. I used less oil and sushi rice. Then I spent 2 hours climbing a 50 foot rock wall and didn't fall off, so the food did its job.AnonymousAustin, TX5/5/2020this was delicious! The sauce on the shrimp is so yummy I'm definitely going to repurpose it. The salad was good, but nothing to write home about. Next time I might add some mango and make it more of a fruit salad as it was just a bit lackluster to me. AnonymousBrooklyn, New York2/26/2020This is so good.  I actually dream of eating it every day.  I double the sauce recipe to make it extra flavourful.  I just want to eat this always.  AnonymousToronto, Canada10/28/2019This was soooo good. The citrus was perfect with the shrimp. Next time I would set aside more of the sauce to put on top rather than to marinate the shrimp in. I plan on making this exactly one million more times. mhdsileskyAustin, TX4/9/2019Delicious!  Made it for the third time tonight.  I have made with a mix of grapefruit and oranges, which is a hit.  I put in more citrus than the recipe calls for.  Instead of white rice, we have put it on quinoa, riced cauliflower and the super-easy rice packets from Trader Joes.AnonymousMissouri3/18/2019MAJOR winner. Made this for dinner with a dear friend and we were marveling at the spice, the sweetness, the char on the shrimp ... Gorgeously balanced recipe. Added a couple of touches of my own : Wild rice cooked in half water, half orange juice and fresh blood orange in the dressing ... Can\u2019t wait to make it again, I was so proud of them.
