I thought the real thing, the fungus that my mom insisted on hiding in Bolognese, carbonara, and stir-fries, was straight up feral. Spongy, dirt-clad, and unsettling. Fast-forward a couple of decades and the balance has tipped. Not only do I eat fungi daily\u2014lovingly spritzing the yellow oysters that sprout creepily from a bag atop of my fridge and lacing my morning coffee with reishi-cacao mix\u2014but it seems everything outside of my kitchen is coming up mushrooms too.Mushroom Hot Cacao Mix$37 at Amazon$19 at HiveThey\u2019re dominating my social media feed; taking over the beauty and wellness industries; inspiring various books, exhibitions, kitschy poster art, fashionable foraging shoots, and adorable home goods; providing, thanks to their unique structure and chemical properties, the ideal building blocks for everything from housing insulation to faux leather; and being pegged as ecological saviors sent to transform the way we manufacture, consume, and live. And yeah, the psychedelic ones are going mainstream too\u2014reports show millennials are opting out of binge-boozing culture in favor of microdosing tiny amounts of psilocybin in the name of self-care. If I knew anything at all about \u201cthe stock market,\u201d I\u2019d put all my money on mushrooms. (Okay, and those cute little robots that deliver food right to your door. Those are gonna be big.)Mushroom Night Light$11 $10 at AmazonOf course, mushrooms have been around forever. In fact, we share a common evolutionary history\u2014a limb on the genealogical tree that branched away from plants \u201cperhaps 1.1 billion years ago,\u201d Natalie Angier wrote for The New York Times in 1993. One researcher cited in the piece said this is why fungal diseases are so pesky to treat. \u201cA lot of the metabolism is so similar that you can\u2019t target a fungus sufficiently without gravely affecting the human host as well,\u201d said Mitchell L. Sogin, Ph.D., of the Center for Molecular Evolution at the Marine Biological Laboratory. So, basically, we are mushrooms and mushrooms are us and that toenail fungus will plague you for years. Crazy!While fungi have long been prized in other cultures, many non-Indigenous Westerners are only just waking up to them. \u201cOver the last 70 years or so, America has been incredibly mycophobic,\u201d says Gordon Walker, \u200bPh.D., the mycologist behind @FascinatedByFungi\u2014a TikTok account dedicated to getting its 778K-plus followers stoked on \u2019shrooms. \u201cI think a lot of that dates from around World War II, when we lost much of our immigrant food cultures to the great whitewashing of American food\u2014which came at the detriment to local food systems but to the boon of national processing companies.\u201d As food was industrialized and optimized for speed, cheapness, and ease of manufacture, tater tots, TV dinners, and Spam cans pushed fresh produce to the collective periphery. Mushrooms may have particularly fallen out of favor because they\u2019ve long been considered objects of fear.Wooden Salt and Pepper Grinder$123 at Etsy\u201cIt\u2019s always been like, \u2018Eeewww, [mushrooms],\u2019\u201d says chef, writer, and TV host Sophia Roe. \u201cLike, they\u2019re these phallic things that represent death, rot, and mold\u2014none of which are actually bad.\u201d But an influx of books, YouTube channels, and social accounts like Walker\u2019s are granting us more information about mushrooms than ever before. \u201cPeople used to be very suspicious of mushrooms because eating the wrong one could easily kill you or make you ill,\u201d says Gina Rae La Cerva, a geographer, environmental anthropologist, and the author of Feasting Wild: In Search of the Last Untamed Food. \u201cNow you can basically snap a photo with your phone and identify something, even if you\u2019re in the middle of nowhere.\u201dToday, Americans produce and eat record amounts of fungi. They\u2019re one of the most sustainable foods grown in the United States, and, with more people leaning into plant-based diets for both environmental and health reasons, \u201cmeaty\u201d-textured mushrooms are an ideal swap for animal products, according to Roe. But perhaps most crucially, we\u2019re learning how to cook with mushrooms and realizing they\u2019re very delicious. \u201cAmerica is starting to become more obsessed with mushrooms,\u201d says Roe, \u201cbecause we know what to do with them. We can RIP that whole cream of mushroom thing.\u201dMushroom Citrus Juicer$12 at Urban OutfittersBut is a trend really a trend unless the wellness industry has gotten involved? Used for centuries in traditional medicine, functional mushrooms\u2014the ones that promise enhanced moods, boosted immune systems, and increased energy\u2014are popping up in everything from daily capsules to facial exfoliators to protein powders. While fungi have no doubt produced some of our most important medical drugs (like penicillin and cholesterol-lowering statins), the jury is ultimately still out on whether any of the claims these New Age products make hold water. According to Walker, supplements are probably not having the functional effect we think they are in the small quantities they\u2019re consumed. \u201cThe benefit comes from just eating the mushrooms,\u201d he says.Moon Juice Acid Potion Exfoliator$42 at Moon JuicePersonally, I\u2019ve been catfished by too many wellness trends to fully embrace the medicinal claims\u2014or, who knows, maybe I\u2019m still a little mycophobic, despite my better impulses\u2014but that doesn\u2019t stop me from making a coffee-reishi bev every morning. I can\u2019t speak to the \u201cadaptogenic properties,\u201d but I drink it for the creamy, nutty, and chocolaty kick it gives my morning joe. And although consuming reishi may be relatively new to me, I\u2019m mindful of the cultures who\u2019ve been using these and other mushrooms medicinally and ceremonially for thousands of years. With psilocybin use legalized for mental health treatment in Oregon and more states sure to follow, there will undoubtedly be questions\u2014as there are with white sage and marijuana\u2014about who profits from medicines that have been used by nonwhite cultures for millennia.And no, you\u2019re not tripping. Mushrooms are definitely sprouting up in the fashion and design industries, too, where we\u2019re wearing fungi on our literal sleeves and inviting them to take over our homes. They\u2019re everywhere: embroidered into this sparkly, psychedelic Ashish dress; repped by celebs; and inspiring some truly adorable lighting situations. Not to mention, designers are getting hyped on mycelium leather\u2014which is made from mushrooms\u2019 sprawling, underground network of fungal threads.Photo courtesy TomboloTombolo Fungi Top$136 at TomboloPerhaps everything is coming up mushrooms because we find ourselves trying to reconnect with nature\u2014even if just by ordering a T-shirt. Or perhaps the reason designers can\u2019t stop referencing mushrooms is the same reason we can\u2019t stop eating, wearing, and buying them: Fungi carry the potential to fundamentally uproot how we live on (and with) earth. And that\u2019s just super groovy, man. So, between now and fungi-topia you can catch me rubbing mushroom serum on my face, hounding mushroom risotto, and dancing in the mushroom light wearing my mushroom-embroidered disco sweater.Critter Wine Stopper$10 at Urban OutfittersLong live mushrooms!1 / 54ChevronChevronCreamy-ish of Mushroom SoupView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titLifestyleShoppingTrendsRecipes you want to make.
