Some brands of harissa are spicier than others, so be sure to taste as you go and adjust the crushed red pepper flake usage depending on how spicy you\u2019d like your finished product.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I didn\u2019t have any harissa so I used a little extra tomato paste and more red pepper flakes. Very tasty and perfect degee of hotness.Anonymous2/21/2022Wonderful and simple! Loved the addition of bread into this. I used a very stale and hard baguette that softened up beautifully in the spicy and briney sauce. I will definitely be making this for the family again and again.
