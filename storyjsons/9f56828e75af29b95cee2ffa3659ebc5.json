Thanks, Andy!By Alex BeggsMay 2, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailAlex LauFacebookTwitterEmailEvery Friday morning, Bon App\u00e9tit senior staff writer Alex Beggs shares weekly highlights from the BA offices, from awesome new recipes to office drama to restaurant recs, with some weird (food!) stuff she saw on the internet thrown in. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Something to cookIn a kitchen without my usual spice brigade, I\u2019ve adapted to my biological need for chile crisp with what I call Minimalist Chile Crisp. I stole it from this steak recipe by Andy Baraghani. Three ingredients: Fry sliced or chopped garlic in whatever oil over low-ish heat until it\u2019s browned and crispy, pour it all into a little bowl where a tablespoon of red chile flakes is waiting. This condiment has saved a boring batch of lentils, all my scrambled eggs, and maybe even my marriage. Just kidding, I\u2019m not married. But I bet it WOULD!Spice things up: Steak Short Ribs with Crispy Garlic and Chile OilWant this letter before it hits the website?

As a lover of the literary and nacho arts, I am tempted to submit my own poem to Taco Bell Quarterly:There once was a girl from Houston.Who couldn\u2019t hold her Taco Bell toots in.She leaned over quick,And cried out with an \u201cick!\u201dThen realized her Zoom was unmuted.Illustration by GraphicaArtis/Getty ImagesThe big bagEver notice how coffee beans just run out? Especially in a household full of PEOPLE? My out-laws have found an impressive solution to this recurring problem, which is to buy the motherload FIVE-POUND bag of beans from Intelligentsia. Free shipping and everything. It\u2019s a little over a month\u2019s supply. I felt the need to share this insider tip with you.P.S.: Here are more places to order great coffee online.More insider tipsIf you saw chef Ashleigh Shanti making strawberry compote to go with her lacy-delicious cornmeal pancakes from our May issue on Instagram this week, you may have thought to yourself: WOW THAT ROBE LOOKS COZY, WONDER WHERE IT\u2019S FROM. Just me? Well all is revealed (thanks, Ashleigh): it\u2019s Reigning Champ. Merely looking at it makes me want to take a nap in a patch of sunlight.

For staffers at home with their own kiddos or siblings, I wanted to hear about the fights over Cheddar Bunnies and whatnot. One of Julia Kramer\u2019s sons has eaten \u201cnothing but rice, tortillas (cold from the fridge and not warmed up), and cheese sticks for 6 weeks.\u201d Chris Cristiano confessed that his brother \u201ctried to ripen an avocado by putting it in the oven.\u201d Awww, how old is your brother? I asked. \u201c38.\u201d Meryl Rothstein\u2019s sweet daughter is going through a highly specific phase in which no food she\u2019s given should be cut into kid-sized pieces. \u201cNo cut!\u201d the tiny queen demands. Adam Rapoport sent me a list of 28 feuds he\u2019s had with his offspring, such as, \u201cHe likes more jelly than peanut butter on his PB&J\u2014that is a total amateur move.\u201d Then Chris Morocco, whose two children have made a few cameos in recent BA videos, let it out:\u201cThey want to eat applesauce on my bed. They compete to see whose banana has brown mushy spots BECAUSE THEY LIKE THE BROWN MUSHY SPOTS ON BANANAS! They will only eat orange cheddar, never white, even though they taste exactly the same. They refer to the orange cheddar as \u2018blue cheese\u2019 because Cabot\u2019s version comes in a blue wrapper. They spat out the grilled cheese I made on camera because it had \u2018too much flavor.\u2019\u201d Good luck out there, Chris!Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecultureTrader Joe\u2019s Latest Snacks, Reviewed in These Strange, Strange TimesBy Alex BeggscookingYou Might Have Everything in Your Pantry to Make Tahini Brownies This WeekendBy Alex BeggscultureI Used Up Random Rice and Made BA\u2019s Best RisottoBy Alex BeggscookingThis Cocktail Is Called the Rattlesnake, and That\u2019s Reason Enough to Make ItBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
