Traditionally it\u2019s made by roasting a whole chicken, but here it\u2019s broken down into parts for easier browning and faster cooking. When serving, don\u2019t forget about tearing off pieces of the bread: It will have soaked up some of the juices from the chicken and the sweet onions.Ingredients4 servings1tsp. ground allspice\u00bdtsp. ground cardamom\u00bdtsp. ground cumin2Tbsp. sumac, plus more for sprinkling4whole chicken legs (thigh and drumstick; about 2\u00bd lb. total)Kosher salt\u00bccup plus 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil3medium white onions, coarsely chopped\u00bccup pine nuts or slivered almondsTaboon bread or Turkish or Indian flatbreads, warmed (for serving)1lemon, halvedPreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 350\u00b0. Mix allspice, cardamom, cumin, and 2 Tbsp. sumac in a small bowl to combine.Step 2Season chicken all over with salt in a large bowl. Rub with half of spice mix, pressing and working it into the meat.Step 3Heat \u00bc cup oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high. Cook chicken, turning occasionally, until golden brown on both sides and some fat is released, 3\u20135 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a large plate, leaving fat in skillet.Step 4Return skillet to medium-high heat. Cook onions, scraping any browned bits on bottom of skillet and adding a splash of water if pan gets dry, until softened and golden brown, 18\u201325 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining spice mix and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add \u00bc cup water, season with salt, and bring to a simmer. Nestle chicken back into skillet, skin side up, and transfer to oven. Bake, uncovered, until liquid is mostly evaporated and chicken is cooked through, 30\u201335 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes in skillet.Step 5While chicken is cooking, toast pine nuts in remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in a small skillet over medium heat, stirring frequently, until golden brown and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and season with salt.Step 6Arrange warmed bread on a platter and top with chicken and onions. Scatter pine nuts over and sprinkle with more sumac. Squeeze juice from one lemon half over chicken. Cut remaining lemon half into wedges to serve alongside.How would you rate Musakhan (Sumac Chicken With Onions and Flatbread)?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (9)Back to TopTriangleDELICIOUS! making it again this weekend James Derek DwyerBoston4/29/2021Amazing recipe!! Thanks\nI need to make 13 portions and wanted to ask if I can prepare ahead and if so how would you suggest I reheat? I was thinking adding a tbsp of water per thigh into the pot and putting it a cold oven and reheating to 190\u00b0celsius. Then it should be warm enough without starting to cook over. WOuld love to get your feedback :) Thanks! AlanToulouse, France4/1/2021This is FABULOUS!   Going to make for the second time tonight, but don't have any bread so will serve with mashed potatoes.   YUMMY!JuJuConway, NH3/31/2021Delicious. Just like my Israeli mother in-law makes. Would make again, but I served with vermicelli rice pilaf instead. Used a bit of baharat in the rice.
