It\u2019s subtly spiced with bay leaves and cardamom, then set in a gelatin mold that your cousins will never see coming and crowned with sugary orange zest and cranberries. You can use a Bundt pan (we like this one) as well; they\u2019re slightly larger so the gelatin won\u2019t fill the pan, but that\u2019s okay, it\u2019ll still flip out beautifully.

Chill until completely set, at least 12 hours.Step 3To serve, dip mold in a bowl of warm water and hold 30 seconds. Remove and place a platter upside down over top of mold. Invert jelly onto platter.Step 4Just before serving, toss orange zest, remaining 2 Tbsp. cranberries, and remaining 3 Tbsp. sugar in a small bowl to coat.

Keep chilled.How would you rate Fancy Cranberry Sauce?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (16)Back to TopTriangleWe make a version of this every year.  We have a few vegetarian guests and I sub a can of the cranberry jell for the gelatin.  I use water rather than juice to keep it from being too sweet. Add the canned  cranberry with fruit and boil.  I use a vintage mold and it comes out as a holiday showstopper! Jenn CState College, PA11/26/2021Whoa. This recipe made me fall in love with cranberry sauce. It made me realize the role cranberry sauce is supposed to play on my Thanksgiving plate. It also made me fall in love with Cardamom. Mmm. Whenever I bring this dish to a party, jaws are dropped (including my own).\n\nTip: I line my molds with Crisco using a paper towel and followed their hot water method for release. The molds come out perfectly clean.\n\nA variation to consider is adding some chopped-up hibiscus fruit along with the cranberries.Larissa S. Austin, TX11/15/2021This is not a joke: I wish I added the sumac. I didn't have it on hand and I didn't add it bc I didn't think it would be a big deal, that was a bad idea. It came out really needing that citrusy note. I remade it with lemon juice and tiny bit of zest and it was a lot better! I highly recommend adding in the sumac if you have it. Sorry Andy, but you were wrong on this one! AnonymousChicago, IL11/26/2020My husband used to like the canned cranberry until I made this.  Now it\u2019s a requirement for him and it\u2019s an absolute showstopper on the table.Adam BKenosha, Wisconsin11/24/2020Tastes great! I added some Sumac as Brad would\u2019ve wanted, and it was delicious!Utah11/1/2020Great recipe! Could have used a little sumac.AnonymousChicago5/20/2020AMAZING made this just for fun to go with dinner!!! The only thing it could have used is a little bit of sumac Anonymous4/21/2020This was tasty and the flavors were unexpected with cardamom and fresh bay leaf to season the sauce. I didn\u2019t make time for the gelatin, but the taste was still there! EnoughpotentialNorway12/5/2019How the measurements are listed in the recipe are incredibly awkward.  Having the gelatin listed in grams would have been far more helpful because when buying a package of gelatin that's how it is listed (I ended up using 28g of gelatin). I wasn't a huge fan of the cranberry skins that were in some bites so I think trying to strain those out or something might need to happen in future batches.AnonymousVirginia Beach, VA, USA11/30/2019I loved this. The flavor was complex but clean and I loved the presentation. Next time I will seek out a gelatin mold for extra drama (used Bundt Pan this time.) leighwhit25Atlanta ga 11/29/2019Cant find cardamom pods - how much cardamom spice is equivalent?VikaBellaQueens, NY11/26/2019I made this recipe with fresh cranberries, unsweetened 100% cranberry juice from Trader Joes, and the only modification was I skipped the gelatin step. FYI if you're weighing your ingredients, the sugar is 338g. The flavor is fantastic, with bright cranberry flavor. The texture was what I was going for as well, served out of a bowl and not inverted from a mold.dtempNC11/26/2019I just did a tester of this before making it for Thanksgiving. It tastes great, but it definitely did not set up like it did in the video. It was still a liquid after sitting for 16 hours. In my next attempt, I would use orange juice in place of water and probably double the gelatin to get something sliceable. cozyfiendWisconsin11/21/2019I decided to make this for Friendsgiving instead of my usual cranberry chutney and it was a hit. It's a delicious cranberry sauce that's pretty easy to put together the day before. AnonymousMichigan11/18/2019What happened to the sumac? It's a match made in heaven!AnonymousLos Angeles, CA11/13/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titAmericanCranberryBerryFruitSideDairy-FreeNut-FreeGluten-FreeThanksgivingRecipes you want to make.
