Nespresso Paris Black coffee1 \u00bc   tsp. gelatin4 oz. cooked foie gras4 Tbsp. butter, softened2 Tbsp. Port wine2 tsp. sugarSalt and pepper2 slices French brioche, toasted1 Tbsp. candied coffee beansFor candied coffee beans:10 coffee beans1 Tbsp. sugarRecipe PreparationPlace 1 cup of Nespresso coffee in a small bowl and sprinkle the gelatin over top. Let sit for 5 minutes. Bring the Port, sugar, and remaining Nespresso coffee to a boil in a small saucepan. Remove the pan from the stove and add the Nespresso coffee and gelatin mixture. Whisk until gelatin is dissolved.Combine the foie gras and butter in the bowl of a food processor. Process until smooth. Pour in the Nespresso coffee and Port mixture, season with salt and pepper, and blend until smooth. Chill the mixture in the refrigerator until well chilled and set up. Spoon onto the toasted brioche and top with the candied coffee beans.For candied coffee beans:Pulse the coffee beans in a coffee grinder once or twice until they are just lightly crushed.Place the crushed beans in a fine mesh sieve to eliminate the very small pieces or dust. Heat the sugar in a small nonstick pan over medium heat. As the sugar melts and caramelizes slightly, add beans and roll in sugar until coated. Remove from the heat.Recipe by chef Daniel RoseSponsored by NespressoGET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for the Bon App\u00e9titNewsletterSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyExplore Bon App\u00e9titSponsoredMore from Bon App\u00e9titRecipes6 Pro Chefs Reveal Their \"Secret Weapon\" Ingredients2022-03-02T17:00:00.000ZrecipePorcini Gnocchi With Butter Sauce2022-03-15T09:00:00.000ZrecipeWhiskey Sour2020-12-16T18:20:00.000ZBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
