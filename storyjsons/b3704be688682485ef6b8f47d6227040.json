Even if you\u2019re not a beer nerd, Dieu du Ciel makes over 150 varieties, from stouts to IPAs to sour ales, so you\u2019re sure to find something you dig. Sure, there\u2019s a selection of cocktails, scotch, and whiskies, but everyone is here for the beer. If you\u2019re hungry, the micropub has a kitchen, so you can get individual pizzas, sandwiches, and other pub snacks.THE VIBE IS: relaxed at any time of day (or night). Despite its reputation for making superlative microbrews, Dieu du Ciel has an unassuming, unpretentious air, so beer noobs can feel at ease.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day 11:30 a.m. to 3 a.m., with the kitchen open until midnight and snacks available until 2 a.m. Heads up: Kids accompanied by parents are welcome during the day, but after 8 p.m. it\u2019s 18 and up.\u2014Claire SaffitzSamuel JoubertSamuel JoubertWE ALSO LOVELarrysA natural wine bar that also serves the best breakfast in Mile EndCaf\u00e9 OlimpicoGet your caffeine fix at this Mile End espresso shopSt-Viateur Bagel ShopSettle the great bagel debate by getting a dozen at the famed Mile End mini chainExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
