The fragrant spices in the gingersnap dough against the bitterness of the chopped candied orange peels are exactly what I want this time of the year.\u201d Blanching the citrus peel in several changes of boiling water removes bitterness while still leaving plenty of bright flavor behind.IngredientsMakes about 28Candied citrus peel2cups 1\"\u20132\"-wide strips lemon, lime, orange, or grapefruit zest (pith removed)2cups granulated sugarCookies1tsp. ground ginger\u00bdtsp. ground cardamom\u00bdtsp. ground cinnamon\u00bctsp. ground cloves3\u00bdcups all-purpose flour1Tbsp. baking soda1tsp.

Only had dark molasses so they are a little darker but great!Pauline OWhittier, CA4/29/2021Pretty good! Like other reviewers, I think the ratios may be a little off; too much flour, not enough spice. Still good though, and if I make them again I'll play with the portions.KelseyVermont 1/23/2021These are so good! The candied citrus peel is wonderful with the spices - peeling the citrus without the pith takes a little practice but can be done with a potato peeler - you will soon get the knack of i!. Prepare the candied citrus the day before you bake, then the process doesn't seem as long. Once you have your citrus strips candied, let them drip dry in a strainer and chop them very finely - very important to get the good chewiness you want. And save the delicious syrup - can be used to add a good sweet citrusy taste, for ex. to marinades, to drizzle on a pound cake for a great taste, add a little to your salad dressing to give a nice citrus balance to the acidity...maybe invent a new ice cream! I might try making them a bit smaller next timeRobin Lejre,Denmark1/2/2021I thought the candied peel was a bit too chewy/tough, but overall the cookie was pretty good!Anonymous12/25/2020Just tasted these cookies and they are wonderful! I love the burst of citrus and the tongue tingle from the white pepper. Definitely used fresh spices. Used an Oxo peeler to get a nice rind and used all of it! Next time I may try for a finer chop by processing the rind along with some of the sugar. Now I get to decide what to do with that syrup... cocktail ideas? MJoPort Townsend, WA12/24/2020I wanted to like these cookies. I wanted to love these cookies. Ginger cookies are hands-down my favorite. \nBut, the TIME it takes to make these - frankly isn\u2019t worth it. \nSomething also feels off with the ratio of ingredients - the flour in particular. \nI would amp up the spices big time if I made it again; they barely cut through in the finished cookie when following the recipe. \nThey\u2019re good, but not great. And not worth the effort to candy all the citrus. JohnHudson, NY12/23/2020As a guide, it took me 5 lemons, 1 orange, 1 mandarin, 1 lime and 1 grapefruit to get 2 cups of citrus peel. Took 2-3 hours total.  A lot of work, but worth it ultimately.Anonymous12/22/2020That\u2019s a LOT of flour. But no weight supplied. I\u2019m really reluctant to try this recipe without weight measurements. Come on, Bon App\u00e9tit, that should be mandatory for all baking recipes. Looks lovely, though.NeedMoreCatsNew York12/19/2020The best ginger cookie recipe you will ever make!!! I ended up doubling all the spices because I like a spicier cookie and it turned out fantastic! Also it\u2019s good that the candied citrus recipe makes more than what it calls for in the recipe, so you can use the candied peels for another purpose, or to make the recipe again.JuliaToronto, Canada12/8/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titCookieDessertScandinavianEuropeanGingerHerbs & SpicesCitrusFruitWinterSnackNut-FreeVegetarianBakingChristmasRecipes you want to make.
