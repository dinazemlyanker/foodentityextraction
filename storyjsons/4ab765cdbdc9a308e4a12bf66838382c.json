Food Styling by Pearl Jones.\u00a0EmailPinterestPrintEmailPinterestPrintHere\u2019s an idea inspired by tahdig, socarrat, and other forms of crispy, crusty scorched rice prized \u2019round the world: use a hot, oil-slicked pan to impart a delightful crunch to a fresh pot of rice\u2014or skip step 1 and use a few cups of leftover rice straight from the fridge! Here, that rice is paired with rounds of juicy citrus, sliced avocado, and tender saut\u00e9ed shrimp. For the most striking presentation (and the widest range of sweet to tart flavors), choose a mix of fruits, like blood oranges, grapefruits, and Cara Caras. Tinned tuna dressed in olive oil is an easy swap for shrimp.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Proceed to deal with the citrus per step 2 and so forth, onwards to the end of the recipe. However, since this is a bit like a fried rice, for those cooking their rice as part of the recipe, here's some science from the Food Lab: \"As rice sits after cooking, a couple things happen. First, there's evaporation: The rice gets drier. Second, we've got starch retrogradation: Gelatinized starches that have swollen up and softened during cooking will recrystallize as they cool, turning the rice firm and less sticky.\" Dryer rice = better results when frying. You want the rice to form clumps, so letting it cool down so the starches re-crystalize gives you better cohesion. I'll be making this tomorrow... and making the rice tonight. SuzinsfSan Francisco3/3/2022Tasty lunch for California weather that is already reaching 80\u00b0 in February. Will make again. Jenna C. Los Angeles, CA2/10/2022This dish will brighten any day. It's important to taste and season the dressing--it needs to slap before anything else is added to it and, depending on the time of year, it will need teaspoons more sugar, acid, and/or salt to balance the flavors. The dressing could also use a small chili (deseeded & diced)--the heat will heighten the cooling effect of the avocado and sweet citrus juices, making everything dance even more.AnonymousSeattle1/4/2022Really enjoyed this salad. It was super easy for a week night and tasted kinda fancy without much effort, so I'd also make it for friends, I think. My only edit is to reduce the red onion; mine was really small and it still was a bit much.AnonymousSioux Falls, South Dakota12/15/2021This was a pretty delicious weeknight winter dinner salad.  I'll definitely make it again; the only edit I suggest is to reduce the red onion, probably by about half. Otherwise, quick and tasty.H.M.Sioux Falls, South Dakota12/15/2021This was yummy!  I added a bit of honey to the shrimp dressing, and made the salad bigger (added kale, radicchio, some thin red cabbage slices).  Will absolutely make this again!SLFNY , NY12/9/2021It says you can use cold leftover rice OR cook the rice according to the recipe.\n\nGreat recipe!Anonymous12/4/2021This is a refreshing, bright meal that is welcome after the heavy holiday food. The avocado provides a smooth bridge between the sweet and tart flavors. It's quick to make and suitable for guests. And, as the description promises, you can make a fresh pot of rice or use leftover if you have it in the fridge. Either way, this is a keeper.RedqueenGainesville, FL12/3/2021I presume that if you use cooked rice you then start with step 5 for the rice.  Hope it still turns out okAnonymousChicagoland 12/2/2021Uhm, the description promises using left over rice (presumably already cooked) but the recipe starts with cooking rice.
