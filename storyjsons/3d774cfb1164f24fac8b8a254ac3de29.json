It can turn a staple like a bag of inexpensive red beans into a hearty flavorful soup in about 45 minutes\u2014with absolutely no presoaking. A quick saute\u0301 of onion, garlic, and spices makes an aromatic base that seasons the whole pot, while quinoa adds bulk and texture.What do I do while dinner is off cooking itself? In a dream world I\u2019d probably do as little as possible, relishing it, ideally with a glass of wine. In reality I\u2019m helping with homework, managing some other last-minute chaos, or making the kinds of toppings that get the kids (and the adults) much more excited about a bowl of beans and quinoa. We call these taco fixins: corn tortilla strips baked into crispy chips, quick-pickled red onion, sliced avocado, cilantro, crumbled cheese, limes, and some hot sauce for the grown-ups. Everyone heaps their bowls with whatever they like. Nothing delights me more than when the reward for having no dinner plan is a delicious meal that came together without a minute of planning.Get the recipe:Instant Pot Red Bean and Quinoa Soup With Taco FixinsWhen 5:15 p.m. hits and there\u2019s still no dinner plan, Deb Perelman makes this Instant Pot soup in 45 minutes flat.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPicky Eaters\u2019 ClubRecipes you want to make.
