The goal was to dispel any associations you might have with the sandwich: the sort of floppy, slightly rubbery fast food versions with a single, soggy leaf of lettuce. It's inspired by Caesar salad, inspired by mayonnaise, inspired by the idea of special sauce, inspired by grill marks, and the words \u201ccharred buns.\u201d Here are the components that make this the best grilled chicken sandwich you\u2019ll ever make (probably!?):Respect paid to the special sauceIt begins with a marinade of Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, lemon, and pepper, whisked and emulsified into a tangy-creamy Caesar-mayo dressing with a slow pour of olive oil. The chicken marinates in some of that while you doctor up the rest for your special sauce (add cornichons and mayo for best results).Chicken notesBoneless, skinless chicken thighs are close to impossible to overcook, and the marinade makes them even juicier than normal. Grilled over medium-high heat, they\u2019ll be done in 8-10 minutes. However: please let them rest for five minutes to account for carryover cooking and allow all of the juices to recirculate within the meat. While they rest, make the fennel slaw.Shaved fennel requires a mandoline, just buy one already! (Here\u2019s our favorite).\nPhoto by Stephen Kent Johnson, Food Styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiWhat, fennel?Yes! A fennel-basil slaw adds an unexpected but very welcome fresh crunch to all the char and acidity. (\u201cAnd don\u2019t forget that I originally had castelvetranos in that slaw, which Adam Rapoport immediately squashed. Was worth a shot,\u201d noted Molly.) Lemon juice tones down the licorice-ness of the fennel\u2014the fennel instead functions like a crunchy pickle would (and is something that blew our minds the first time we had this lamb burger at Hart\u2019s.) The chopped-up fennel fronds (look like dill) are the final garnish. I like the way the photo shows them scattered casually, like a wind blew in and the fennel fronds found their place in the chicken sandwich universe.Don\u2019t forgetTo grill the bun. 30 seconds, done.Other toppings includeLettuce. Tomato.Some assembly requiredThere\u2019s a method to Molly\u2019s madness, which is to build from the ground up in the following order on mayo-dressed buns: lettuce (she pronounces this \u201cle-toose\u201d which you don\u2019t need to know but now know), tomato, chicken, and then fennel slaw. The order keeps balance in the chicken sandwich universe. And finally, the recipe concludes with my favorite final line in any recipe: \u201cClose sandwiches with top buns.\u201d Everything in its place.Get the recipe:Grilled Chicken Sandwich with Caesar-ish DressingDeeply charred mustardy chicken thighs are paired with a crunchy and refreshing fennel-basil slaw for the ultimate summer-night chicken sandwich.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titChickenSandwichGrill BarbecueFennelRecipes you want to make.
