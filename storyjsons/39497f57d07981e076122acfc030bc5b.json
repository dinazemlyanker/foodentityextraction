Made as is with plenty of salt at each stage.AnonymousSeattle, WA11/15/2021I was very disappointed with this recipe. Squash was bland and the sauce was gross. AnonymousNew York6/28/2020This is AMAZING. Bright, fresh, simple, and exciting! I wish I made about 4 times more onions, however. I will definitely be making this again!!AnonymousAustin, TX11/19/2019First of all, I've been loving BA recipes lately and have made so many from the Healthyish list! This was not bad, I enjoyed eating for dinner and lunch the next day, but probably won't be making this again. I felt like the sauce was missing a hit of acid, I had a half of a lime sitting in my fridge and that definitely brightened the sauce up, but it needed a lot more. I really loved the onions (I adore this method of preparing red onions and would eat it with anything) but I wasn't 100 percent sold on this combination of flavors. Ended up serving with farro instead of brown rice because that's what I had lying around. But hey, this was pretty cheap and healthy too. Overall, reasonably tasty recipe, but felt like my bowl was missing something when it was finally put together.
