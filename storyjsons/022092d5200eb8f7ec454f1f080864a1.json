Join Suzara, the Healthyish team, and our partner Caviar at Cala in San Francisco on March 27th, or see when we'll be in a city near you.When I step into her Berkeley, California apartment on a brisk February morning, Aileen Suzara greets me with a hug. We sit at a sunlit table, a bowl of Cara Cara orange slices already waiting for me to snack on before we start cooking lunch. Since I\u2019ve interviewed her before, I joke that she\u2019s probably sick of me by now. \u201cOh my gosh! Not at all,\u201d she says. \u201cYou must be sick of me.\u201d She asks how I\u2019m doing, how my writing is going. I feel like I did as a kid catching up with my sister over an after-school snack, the weight of the day melting away.Suzara, 33, brings that same warmth and hominess to her work helping Filipino-Americans reconnect with healing foods from their heritage. Her food business, Sariwa (Tagalog for \u201cfresh\u201d), serves healthy, vegetable-based Filipino dishes beyond the fried, meaty fare more familiar to American palates.Cooking is a major form of self-care for Suzara. Although it might entail preparing a lavish meal, \u201cother times, I just want to put something in my belly and feel like the dish is giving me a hug,\u201d she says. She traces her earliest memory of lugaw\u2014the dish we plan to cook together, a rice porridge similar to congee\u2014to her mother, who made it for her when she was 11 to soothe a winter cold. It\u2019s an easy-to-make comfort dish that allows for ample freedom in ingredients.As I get to work peeling a claw of ginger, Suzara chops leeks, scallions, and garlic. \u201cI\u2019m hardcore with ginger and garlic,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen a recipe calls for two cloves of garlic, I\u2019m like, why not two heads?\u201dIf she\u2019s not cooking, self-care for Suzara simply means slowing down and \u201cbeing extravagant about time.\u201d Growing up in Waimea, Hawaii, she relished afternoons that stretched aimlessly, sharing food and stories with friends and family. \u201cEmpty time isn\u2019t really empty, though,\u201d she says. \u201cIt allows time to reconnect with our thoughts, our bodies, [and it] allows our minds to rest.\u201dHere in Berkeley, \u201cempty time\u201d might mean cozying up with a fantasy novel, preferably one with a female protagonist. (One of her favorites is Monica Furlong\u2019s Juniper, about a Celtic princess who learns herbalism and the healing arts.) \u201cThese stories are all about restoring the natural balance,\u201d she says, \u201cversus male-centered narratives, where it\u2019s like, \u2018Let\u2019s destroy it!\u2019\u201dSuzara turns to nature to step outside herself, going on hikes and occasionally driving two hours north to Yuba River. As someone who grew up near the ocean, and whose family hails from coastal provinces in the Philippines, Suzara admits that a part of herself \u201cis missing or dormant when I\u2019m away from water.\u201d Her parents immigrated to Buffalo, New York and lived in eight different states before finally settling in Hawaii in the late 1990s. They moved back to the Philippines a little over a decade ago.The components of lugaw, a rice porridge similar to congee.\nPhoto by Peter PratoWhen the leeks and scallions turn translucent, Suzara adds black and brown rice, folding in some glutinous rice for silkiness and \u201csquishiness.\u201d (\u201cThe technical term,\u201d she jokes.) She explains that Sariwa came about because she\u2019d long seen relatives, as well as community members from other cultures, suffer from diabetes and other chronic diseases, which she believed was rooted in a loss of access and connection to the land and to cultural foods. In 2015, she earned a master\u2019s in public health from the University of California, Berkeley.  She began fleshing out the the concept of Sariwa as a culinary health intervention while still a student; it gained acceptance into La Cocina, a San Francisco food incubator, in 2016. She spent about a year there, learning the ropes of running a food enterprise and developing Sariwa, before it officially opened for business last summer.Suzara defines wellness as \u201chaving mental, physical, and spiritual balance so you can live to your full potential.\u201d Importantly, it means others in our communities are thriving too, a perspective anchored in the Filipino concept of kapwa\u2014a shared inner self. Racism and other forms of oppression are societal diseases that ultimately harm us all, she says. \u201cFinding ways to uproot and heal these is also a measure of our own health and wellness.\u201dSuzara also believes that wellness should celebrate culture, and that sharing stories about food is crucial. Relatives and others have told her about healthcare providers advising them to cut back on Filipino food, which can imply, \u201cthis thing you value, that helps tell you who you are, is making you sick.\u201d Yet people in her workshops can often recall eating vegetable dishes growing up. They realize they already carry the ancestral knowledge needed to flip the narrative; they can eat bok choy and sweet potato leaves instead of (often pricey) kale. \u201cIf you want to change health outcomes, those are the pockets of wisdom that have to be shared,\u201d she says.Suzara sets aside the garlic slivers, now crispy and golden-brown, replacing them with chopped Napa cabbage shoots, followed by shimeji and shiitake mushrooms. She stirs fish sauce and chopped cilantro into the lugaw before ladling it into bowls and topping it with the mushrooms, cabbage shoots, garlic, and halved hard-boiled eggs. At the table, we finish it with a squeeze of kalamansi, a small, tart citrus fruit\u2014from a tree she received as a wedding gift\u2014and a drizzle of fish sauce mixed with chili peppers, and lemon and kalamansi juice.The lugaw has a delicate flavor, laced with bright acidity and a subtle, herbaceous bite. By the time I finish, I'm pleasantly warm, and I\u2019m reminded of napping on the sofa after eating my mom\u2019s lugaw on cold, rainy days. We digest with salabat, a tea brewed with ginger, lemongrass, and honey that leaves behind a slow, satisfying burn.The meal is honest, unpretentious, and comforting\u2014like Suzara herself. She admits to \u201cfeeling a little funny\u201d about not having formal culinary training. \u201cI admire the technical genius [of trained cooks], but I also hella admire lola [grandma]-style cooking,\u201d she says. \u201cI get the most excited when people of different abilities feel empowered about creating good, nourishing food.\u201d\u201cBeing able to feed yourself, your loved ones, or community can be a huge contributor to wellness,\u201d she says as we near the end of the meal. Sariwa recently launched a month-long pop-up caf\u00e9 at UC Berkeley alongside two other La Cocina businesses, employing a handful of students. Suzara says her \u201cdream of dreams\u201d is to build out this concept further, housing Sariwa in a physical space and helping youth who want to reconnect to cultural foods gain skills in the kitchen. \u201cWill it be on a college campus? I\u2019m not sure yet,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are a lot of exciting question marks.\u201dJoin Healthyish Superpowered to celebrate Suzara on March 27th in SF.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSuperpoweredprofileRead MoreLifestyleIntroducing Healthyish Superpowered: A New Kind of Dinner PartyBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
