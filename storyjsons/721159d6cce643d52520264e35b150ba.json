Be sure to buy rope-grown mussels, which require a lot less cleaning and are virtually free of grit, and always check each individual bivalve to make sure it's closed tightly before cooking\u2014it's a little tedious, but one dead mussel will ruin the whole pot.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Just keep trying.  Mussels will taste totally different depending on what your base is or what kind of mussels you get.  I am partial to Prince Edward Island mussels.  I think the most common way you have mussels in a restaurant is with basic white wine, garlic,  parsely, and lots of butter,  broth.  Using a beer recipe, or a tomato recipe completely changes the taste. It's worth figuring out how to do this, it's what I get asked to bring to all the pot luck, summer get togethers.BieckiVT1/21/2022I didn't have Mirin or oelek, so i substituted it for a splash of beer (about 3/4 cup) and 1 cup of marcella hazan tomato sauce, plus some mexican crushed chile de arbol,(you could use aleppo) it was amazing!!!!edgarg3729Madrid4/19/2020I really struggled here. Normally I have no issue following Bon Appetit and basically recipes, but mussels are such an unfamiliar and intimidating ingredient and I really felt like there was no guidance here. It took multiple google searches to figure out how to properly store and clean them, and how long they keep fresh. All my mussels were alive and seemed fine according to the recipe, but they didn't taste like mussels I've eaten in restaurants. Out of fear of giving myself food poisoning, I threw out the rest after eating a few. Really disappointed, since I spent $20 on them.AnonymousColumbia, SC1/14/2020The broth here is epic. Will most definitely be cooking this again- a great balance of spicy, tangy and fresh.cerclehuitLos Angeles 9/4/2019Just finished the whole bowl of this. It\u2019s simple and delicious.
