But for a proud Dessert Person with approximately 0 percent interest in the bird, I\u2019m laser-focused on the sugar course (and yes, I always save room).When I\u2019m brainstorming what to bake\u2014something that will say \u201cNotice me (but not too much)\u201d and \u201cCompliment me (but not excessively)\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t you dare say \u2018only a sliver\u2019\u201d\u2014there are some desserts I immediately rule out: Pumpkin and pecan pie put me to sleep upon sight, but anything too far removed from the holiday repertoire (butterscotch trifle, baked Alaska, Devil\u2019s food cake, that weird pear custard pie I made one year\u2026) might be met with protests.It\u2019s a tricky game, trying to pick one dessert that can stand up to the turkey without calling too much attention to itself\u2014but I believe that lemon meringue pie is the perfect candidate: It\u2019s impressive but familiar, it\u2019s refreshing after a heavy meal but not austere, and you get to set the whole thing on fire (well, almost).Chris Morocco\u2019s new recipe is, of course, flawless: velvety, pucker-inducing lemon filling, gooey billows of sweet meringue, and a golden-brown blind-baked pie crust. Unlike most other pie doughs, this one calls for squishing \u00bd-inch chunks between your fingers. Not only is this immensely satisfying, but it also makes for huge butter splotches, leading to an extra-flaky crust. Chris also gives us an exact amount of ice water (\u2154 cup), so there\u2019s don\u2019t need to guess whether the dough is hydrated (hallelujah). Smash the dough together, cut it into quarters, stack those up, and press them down (the same way you\u2019d make BA\u2019s Best Biscuits)\u2014this makes even more layers. It\u2019s fun! It\u2019s wild! Throw your other pie dough recipes away!Heads up: This recipe makes two pie crusts. And while you can halve the quantities and go your merry way, why not make a second disc of dough to keep in your freezer? Your hands are already covered in butter at this point.Bye bye pumpkin pie.\nPhoto by Ted + Chelsea Cavanaugh, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiOkay, once your pie crust is fully baked (meaning that it\u2019s brown all over\u2014this pup doesn\u2019t get baked again), start your filling. It all happens on the stove, an easy exercise in stirring together sugar, water, cornstarch, eggs and yolks, and lemon juice and zest. You\u2019ll do a fair amount of frequent and constant stirring\u2014but that\u2019s what streaming a Podcast is for. Pour the filling into the crust and chill for two hours, by which point your curd will have set into something silky yet sliceable.You can do this whole process a couple of days in advance, thereby freeing up your oven and stove for what some might deem \u201cthe main event\u201d (turkey and gravy). But when you set your pie in the middle of the table, pipe (or plop) the meringue over the top, and br\u00fbl\u00e9e the whole number (if you were looking for an excuse to buy a kitchen torch, now\u2019s your time), no one will be thinking about that turkey or how full they are. They\u2019ll be too busy calculating whether they can beat cousin Eileen to that last remaining slice.
