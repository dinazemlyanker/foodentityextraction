If he had the time. Or the right recipes. Or the right ingredients. Or\u2026well, you get the idea. He very rarely cooks.Both of us work from home; I\u2019m a writer and he runs a marketing company. And because we are child-free and have flexible schedules, either one of us could easily fix dinner. But for two rather nontraditional people, we fall into embarrassingly traditional roles when it comes to the kitchen. Picture me in an apron making a pot of posole rojo while he does the yard work (and yes, he does the dishes, but that\u2019s not the point).When we first started dating a decade ago, back in New York City, my husband would try. He\u2019d come to Brooklyn to stay with me and say, \u201cShould I pick us up some wraps?\u201d No, I did not want him to pick us up some wraps. What even is a wrap, and why are they so terrible? A stale, cold flour tortilla stuffed with something equally stale and cold. It\u2019s like eating sadness. Or fear.Later, when we moved south to Lexington, Kentucky, and I started working from my home office, he\u2019d ask me if I wanted fast food on his way home, but I never wanted fast food either. The only time I ate fast food as a kid was during my parents\u2019 divorce. For better or worse, fast food will always and forever remind me of divorce proceedings. Soggy fries of separation. Greasy nuggets of joint custody agreements. I\u2019m particular, but I have my reasons.Tacos Guerrero knows a thing or two about romance.\nPhoto by Brian KaiserMy husband is a doer, a shower-upper. He\u2019s the guy who loaded every overpacked box of books into the moving truck and then drove us 12 hours in the snow and fog without so much as a minor complaint. He reads all my first drafts (and his printer always works)! We are constantly laughing as we move through the house, his dry humor punctuating the day\u2019s otherwise dreary tasks. He walks the dog in cold weather and lets me sleep in till the heat comes on. All of this makes me want to avoid being the pouting partner who says, \u201cDo I really seem like someone who would eat a wrap to you?\u201dFor years these roles meant that if I wanted a night off from cooking, we\u2019d head downtown to a restaurant. No soft pants and couch time, no snuggling with the dog, no binge-watching old episodes of Veronica Mars, but grown-up going-out time. Committing to a time and a place, making reservations, getting gussied up, not to mention the expense of it all. So if I didn\u2019t feel like cooking\u2014or fast food, or a dreaded wrap\u2014I had better feel like leaving the house.Then one busy spring when I was just about to put away my pots for good and see how long it would take one of us to cave or starve, the taco truck appeared on our corner and everything changed.It\u2019s not just about my Mexican heritage; it\u2019s about what I consider good food. It\u2019s about eating things that bring satisfaction, and for me that means tacos. Tacos are my family food. Tacos remind me of my father, dropping his much-loved carne asada into corn tortillas, smothering it with homemade guacamole and toasted cumin seeds. I\u2019d eat a taco for every meal. In fact, I have eaten a taco for every meal. That one broke summer during graduate school when I thought if I kept putting random ingredients in warm corn tortillas, I might just outrun my own ill-advised relationship choices and their accompanying hangovers. Not once did I suffer taco burnout.Our taco truck, Tacos Guerrero, is parked on the corner of Russell Cave Road just past New Circle in Lexington\u2019s Northside. It has swirling multicolored disco lights, drive-up ordering, folding tables and chairs, and a faux brick fa\u00e7ade that makes it look like an actual outdoor caf\u00e9 (albeit a caf\u00e9 in a gas station parking lot). My husband and I will roll up after long days for warm paper bags stuffed to the brim with tacos al pastor layered under piping hot chunks of pineapple, or tinga de pollo topped with diced onions and fresh cilantro and a choice of green or red salsa that are both so picante they make my eyes sting. We bring them home, pair them with red wine and quality couch time and Veronica Mars. There are no frills, no extras, no unnecessary accoutrements, just good solid tacos wrapped in wax paper, dripping with flavor, and served with a bag of quartered limes to squeeze on top. All they demand of us is that we eat them while they\u2019re still warm.Tacos, a love language.\nPhoto by Brian KaiserDo you know what sentence makes me unbelievably giddy? \u201cShould I just pick us up some tacos on the way home?\u201d Yes, yes you should. You should always and forever pick me up tacos on the way home. And I will pick up tacos for you. And we shall live in harmony.I like to joke that Tacos Guerrero saved our marriage, but after it came along, I realized tacos have always infiltrated all aspects of our relationship. When we decided to get hitched, we knew we\u2019d serve tacos at the wedding. No fancy plated meal or upscale menu. Just tacos. We still laugh that everyone kept telling us to eat because apparently no one eats at their own wedding. Rest assured, we ate. We ate full plates of tinga de pollo and went back for seconds, form-fitting wedding wear be damned. Even our dog pilfered a taco that day. And further back? The very first real meal I made for him in my tiny Brooklyn kitchen? Ground turkey tacos I made from ingredients at a local bodega that never had much but always carried good avocados. Tacos, you see, are my love language.Then, just a few days ago, a funny thing happened. It was a soggy gray day and both my husband and I had deadlines to meet. The dog was snoring loudly. The rain on the roof was making the house feel like a bright port in the storm. Then, suddenly, from the kitchen, I heard\u2026wait, was that the sound of chopping? Of a tortilla smacking the skillet, of an avocado being halved? Was that the smell of onions simmering?Be still my heart; my man was cooking. My man was cooking tacos.Ada Lim\u00f3n is the author of five books of poetry, including 2019\u2019s National Book Critic's Circle Award winner, The Carrying.
