They come from the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Ojibwe and have been making desserts for elders in the Minneapolis community as part of Gatherings Cafe\u2019s meal delivery. Zeller didn\u2019t want to rely on dairy, processed sugars, and flour, because those aren\u2019t native ingredients, so they came up with this simple (and vegan!) dessert: a palm-size tart crusted with crispy wild rice and brimming with berries.Zeller loves Native Harvest wild rice for its consistent high quality and exceptional softness; the grains are grown in the lakes of northern Minnesota and hand-harvested by Ojibwe tribe members. The wild rice forms the shells for this dessert, which are topped with dried cherries that are rehydrated in hot water to soften them as well as add body and sweetness to the strawberry filling.IngredientsMakes 12Vegetable oil (for pan)Kosher salt1cup wild rice8oz. dried tart cherries1lb. strawberries, hulled, plus halved \tstrawberries for servingSmall mint leaves (for serving)PreparationStep 1Heat oven to 350\u00b0. Brush the cups of one standard 12-cup muffin pan or two standard 6-cup muffin pans with oil. Bring 6 cups lightly salted water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add rice, cover, and cook until water evaporates and grains split open, about 1\u00bd hours. Spread out rice on a large rimmed baking sheet and let cool. Reserve pan.Step 2Return rice to pan and, using your hands or a potato masher, smash until rice looks like a chunky mash and grains stick together.Step 3Working one at a time, scoop about 3 Tbsp. rice into each muffin cup and, using an oiled spoon, press rice across bottom and all the way up the sides of each cup to create a hollowed-out shell. Bake until rice is darkened in color and sides of shells are crisped, 25\u201340 minutes. Let shells cool in pans, then, using an offset spatula, carefully transfer to a platter.Step 4Combine cherries and 2 cups cold water in a clean medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook until soft and plump, 5\u20137 minutes. Drain and let cool.Step 5Transfer cherries to a blender and add 1 lb. strawberries; pulse until a chunky pur\u00e9e forms. Use filling immediately or transfer to an airtight container, cover, and chill until cold, at least 1 hour and up to 5 hours.Step 6To serve, fill each shell with about 1 Tbsp. plus 1\u00bd tsp. filling. Top with a strawberry half and a leaf or 2 of mint.How would you rate Strawberry and Wild Rice Tartlets?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (1)Back to TopTriangleInedible.
