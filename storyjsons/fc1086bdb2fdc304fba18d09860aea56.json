We\u2019re honoring the pintos, mayocobas, limas, and garbanzos of the world with a tribute T-shirt, one of several new items we just added to our little merch shop. 100 percent of the net proceeds from the sale of these Beans tees will go to support the inspiring, critical work happening over at World Central Kitchen in the face of COVID-19: providing fresh meals to those in need, putting restaurants back to work, and feeding frontline healthcare workers.Looks good, right?\nWhat else is new in the shop? Well, we\u2019ve re-stocked some old favorites in fresh, spring-y colorways, and we\u2019ve added a GIANT new tote for your next contactless grocery (or wine) run. Our amazing staff photographer Laura Murray took pictures, from a safe, six-foot distance, of the BA staff sporting the latest gear. Head over to our shop to get your merch!New items besides the Beans tee!Photo by Laura MurrayDo You Have Any Natural Wine (Totes)?We designed our dream bag, made in Los Angeles by the folks at Everybody.World: sturdy-but-soft cotton, two built-in interior wine sleeves, and a big, comfy strap. This guy is roomy enough to carry a haul of groceries, a couple bottles of wild-fermented who-knows-what, and a small animal.Looks good, right?\nThe Iconic Claire Shirt\u2014Now in Pink and PurpleOur homage to the queen, Claire Saffitz, and her stunning streak of silver hair.
