Click here to read the whole guide\u2014then stock up.Sure you've had chia pudding, but maybe you're wondering: what are chia seeds good for besides a physical transformation that\u2019s straight out of a John Hughes movie and getting stuck in your teeth? First thing's first: Yes, they're the same seed that powered the Chia Pets craze in the \u201880s. Now that we've got that established, here's everything else you need to know.Where they come from:Chia seeds come salvia hispanica, a flowering mint plant native to parts of Mexico and Guatemala. Its seeds are one of the oldest forms of nutrition\u2014a staple of of Mayan and Aztec diets that became popular in the Western world around a decade ago. They're pretty much tasteless and odorless, but their most obvious characteristic is that they absorb a shocking amount of liquid\u2014up to 10 times their dry weight\u2014swelling into tapioca-like balls beloved by healthy breakfast fanatics and feared by anyone with trypophobia.Why we love them:The term \u201csuperfood\u201d gets tossed around a lot these days, but chia seeds are one of those trendy ingredients that actually deserves the title. The small seeds hold the holy trinity of nutrition\u2014fiber, protein, and omega-3 fatty acids\u2014 which promote slow digestion and a subsequently steady stream of energy. Chia seeds also contain key minerals like calcium and magnesium, and all nine essential amino acids. Plus, they\u2019re naturally gluten-free and vegan.What to look for:It\u2019s common to spot speckled black chia seeds, but white seeds are also available. The only difference is aesthetic. Solid brown seeds aren\u2019t yet mature, and you should probably avoid adding them to your smoothies\u2014their stunted development translates into limited nutritional benefits and an unpleasantly bitter taste. Once purchased, chia seeds can be safely stored in a cool, dry place for several years.Where to buy them:These days, chia seeds are pretty common. You can find them in health food stores and major supermarkets. They\u2019re also available on Amazon and Thrive Market.How to use them:Chia seeds have an extremely subtle flavor, and are therefore prioritized for texture over taste. They\u2019re most commonly used in puddings (both for breakfast and dessert), but we also use them to give body to tonics, smoothies, jams, and even crackers. Sprinkled dry over salads and grain bowls, they give the perfect amount of crunch.Now, put that bag of chia seeds to good use:Coconut Chia-Tapioca PuddingIf you love the texture of chia pudding, it gets even closer to bubble tea with the addition of tapioca pearls here.View RecipeBlueberry-Chia Ice PopsView RecipeTropical Energy BarsIf you can\u2019t find no-sugar-added pineapple, this recipe works with pretty much any dried fruit of your choice.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishChiaRead Morerecipes26 Chia Seed Recipes That Don\u2019t Involve Just PuddingGallery26 SlidesBy The Healthyish TeamRecipes you want to make.
