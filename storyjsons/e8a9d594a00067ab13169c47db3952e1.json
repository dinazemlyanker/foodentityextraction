All of the time.By Alex BeggsOctober 30, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by E. E. BergerFacebookTwitterEmailIt sounded like a construction site inside Sister Pie one recent cold Detroit morning. All of the bakers were pounding out chilled pie dough in unsynchronized cacophony. BANG. Hi are you Lisa? BANG. Yes! Let\u2019s go...outside. BANG! Good idea.Lisa Ludwinski opened Sister Pie in 2015, quickly earned a loyal local following, and this month, the Sister Pie cookbook finally hit bookshelves and flour-dusted kitchen counters. Those who can\u2019t make it to Michigan can make the bakery\u2019s famous salted maple pie in their own ovens, or the dramatic toasted marshmallow butterscotch pie, or the apple sage gouda stunner. There\u2019s also a chapter on salads?! But one of the sections I was most excited about was the \u201cCookies, Etc\u201d one, not just because they\u2019re easier (so what? They are!), but specifically because of the peanut butter paprika cookie. It\u2019s soft and pliable, with a topping of glittery sugar and paprika that makes it stand out against all other traditional hashtag-marked PBs. (If you\u2019re like, \u201cpaprika? Huh?\u201d It adds a burnished rust color, very autumn leafy, but it\u2019s hard to detect otherwise. You might catch a hint of smoke in some bites, but I didn\u2019t.)The cookie setup at Sister Pie is even bigger since this photo was taken.\nJesse David GreenLudwinski was telling me all about it as regulars waved to her on their way inside for their morning coffee and pastry. \u201cMy father was hell-bent on me developing a peanut butter cookie,\u201d she told me while I slowly tore into one to examine the gooey interior. \u201cHe texted me, \u2018How about peanut butter and pear?...or peanut butter and paprika?\u2019 I was like, peanut butter and pear sounds pretty bad. But paprika? I\u2019ll give it a shot.\u201dHer recipe uses smoked paprika from Michigan purveyor Red Goose Spice Company in the dough as well as the sugar coating on top, which adds sparkle as much as it adds a pop rocky-texture mixed with the bakery\u2019s \u201cSugar-Sugar\u201d topping\u2014equal parts turbinado sugar and regular white granulated sugar. (They use it to top pies, sweeten cream cheese in muffins, and to smear on scones too. The turbinado sugar is a bigger crystal, so you get two types of crunchy going on. It\u2019s sugar nuance. The kind of thing Ludwinski thinks about a lot.)Let\u2019s talk about the PEANUT BUTTER. It\u2019s Once Again\u2019s natural peanut butter, which doesn\u2019t separate like other natural peanut butters and drive cooks insane. (It\u2019s the closest natural thing to Jif, Ludwinski told me.) She buys it in huge 9-pound \u201cbarrel\u201d from Amazon. (Add that to your cart along with our other favorite bucket.)When the cookie dough is all mixed, she lets it chill in the fridge for a few hours. \u201cWe chill cookie doughs that need the flavor to develop a little more,\u201d she told me, \u201cbut it\u2019s fine not to. You end up with a different looking cookie. Chilling makes it flat. Baking right after mixing will turn out dome-y, taller, cake-ier cookies. You can do either.\u201dWe went back inside the bakery\u2014BANG!\u2014where Ludwinski and her team were finalizing the Thanksgiving pie lineup. They expect to bake 1,000 pies for the holiday, including an apple butter chess-like pie with cinnamon-sugar crust\u2014\u201can apple cider donut meets... pie!\u201d\u2014that sounds crazy good.But this pie rookie is going to stick to the cookies, and after I master these PB ones, I\u2019m making the golden oaties studded with sweet golden raisins, and then the salted rosemary shortbread, which go as well with tea as much as tomato soup. Or maybe the lightly glazed buttered rum shortbread for Butterbeer vibes? Or get funky with buckwheat flour and try the chocolate chip cookies? I have cookie indecision and I can\u2019t wait to see how it shakes out.Get the recipe:Peanut Butter\u2013Paprika CookiesThis cookie\u2019s soft, salty-sweet, chewy center is spiked with smoked paprika.
