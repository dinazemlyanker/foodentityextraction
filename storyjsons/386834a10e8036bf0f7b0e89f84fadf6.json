Known today as fettuccine Alfredo, the dish gained more fame in the past century in the U.S. than in its home country. But it also evolved in its new environs, and American cooks added heavy cream to thicken and enrich the sauce, and sometimes tossed the pasta with chicken or shrimp. To each their own, but no real fettuccine Alfredo recipe should ever (ever!) include cream.Like Roman staples cacio e pepe and pasta alla gricia, the gloss in Alfredo sauce comes from an emulsion of starchy pasta water and cheese\u2014and, in this case, butter. It\u2019s not a complicated technique, but it requires patience. Add the butter and then the cheese to the pan gradually, making sure everything has come together before you whisk in more. For extra guidance, check out this step-by-step video.The short ingredient list\u2014pasta, butter, and Parmesan\u2014means this is the place to be choosy, particularly with the cheese. Parmigiano Reggiano, which is stamped with its name on the side of the wheel, is the classic choice and will absolutely give you the best flavor, but there are (less expensive) substitutes. Whatever you buy, choose a whole wedge and grate it yourself\u2014or, pulse it in a food processor or high-powered blender (about five 30-second pulses should do it), which will produce small beads of cheese that melt evenly.Editor\u2019s note: This recipe was originally published in our October 2016 issue.Ingredients4  Servings12ounces fettuccine or other long pastaKosher salt\u00bccup (\u00bd stick) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces\u00becup finely grated Parmesan, plus more for servingFreshly ground black pepperPreparationStep 1Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until very al dente.

This \u201ctrattoria\u201d of  Piazza Rosa has become the \u201cbirthplace of fettuccine all\u2019Alfredo\u201d.\nMore specifically, as is well known to many people who love the \u201cfettuccine all\u2019Alfredo\", this famous dish in the world was invented by Alfredo Di Lelio concerned about the lack of appetite of his wife Ines, who was pregnant with my father Armando (born February 26, 1908). \nAlfredo Di Lelio opened his restaurant \u201cAlfredo\u201d in 1914 in Rome  and  in 1943, during the war, he sold the restaurant to others outside his family.\nIn 1948 Alfredo Di Lelio decided to reopen with his son Armando his restaurant in Piazza Augusto Imperatore n.30 \"Il Vero Alfredo\" (\u201cAlfredo di Roma\u201d),  whose fame in the world has been strengthened by his nephew Alfredo and that now managed by me, with the famous \u201cgold cutlery\u201d (fork and spoon gold) donated in 1927 by two well-known American actors Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks  (in gratitude for the hospitality).\nSee the website of \u201cIl Vero Alfredo\u201d. \nI must clarify that other restaurants \"Alfredo\" in Rome do not belong and are out of my brand  \"Il Vero Alfredo \u2013 Alfredo di Roma\". \nThe brand \"Il Vero Alfredo - Alfredo di Roma\" is present in Mexico with a restaurant in Mexico City and a trattoria in Cozumel on the basis of franchising relationships with the Group Hotel Presidente Intercontinental Mexico.\nThe restaurant \u201cIl Vero Alfredo\u201d is in the Registry of \u201cHistoric Shops of Excellence - section on Historical Activities of Excellence\u201d of the Municipality of Roma Capitale.\nBest regards Ines Di Lelio\n\nIN ITALIANO\n\nSTORIA DI ALFREDO DI LELIO, CREATORE DELLE \u201cFETTUCCINE ALL\u2019ALFREDO\u201d (\u201cFETTUCCINE ALFREDO\u201d), E DELLA SUA TRADIZIONE FAMILIARE PRESSO IL RISTORANTE \u201cIL VERO ALFREDO\u201d (\u201cALFREDO DI ROMA\u201d) IN PIAZZA AUGUSTO IMPERATORE A ROMA   \n\nCon riferimento al Vostro articolo ho il piacere di raccontarVi la storia di mio nonno Alfredo Di Lelio, inventore delle note \"fettuccine all'Alfredo\" (\u201cFettuccine Alfredo\u201d).\nAlfredo Di Lelio, nato nel settembre del 1883 a Roma in Vicolo di Santa Maria in Trastevere, cominci\u00f2 a lavorare fin da ragazzo nella piccola trattoria aperta da sua madre Angelina in Piazza Rosa, un piccolo slargo (scomparso intorno al 1910) che esisteva prima della costruzione della Galleria Colonna (ora Galleria Sordi).\nIl 1908 fu un anno indimenticabile per Alfredo Di Lelio: nacque, infatti, suo figlio Armando e videro contemporaneamente la luce in tale trattoria di Piazza Rosa le sue \u201cfettuccine\u201d, divenute poi famose in tutto il mondo. Questa trattoria \u00e8 \u201cthe birthplace of fettuccine all\u2019Alfredo\u201d.\nAlfredo Di Lelio invent\u00f2 le sue \u201cfettuccine\u201d per dare un ricostituente naturale, a base di burro e parmigiano, a sua moglie (e mia nonna) Ines, prostrata in seguito al parto del suo primogenito (mio padre Armando). Il piatto delle \u201cfettuccine\u201d fu un successo familiare prima ancora di diventare il piatto che rese noto e popolare Alfredo Di Lelio, personaggio con \u201ci baffi all\u2019Umberto\u201d ed i calli alle mani a forza di mischiare le sue \u201cfettuccine\u201d davanti ai clienti sempre pi\u00f9 numerosi.\nNel 1914, a seguito della chiusura di detta trattoria per la scomparsa di Piazza Rosa dovuta alla costruzione della Galleria Colonna, Alfredo Di Lelio decise di aprire a Roma il suo ristorante \u201cAlfredo\u201d che gest\u00ec fino al 1943, per poi cedere l\u2019attivit\u00e0 a terzi estranei alla sua famiglia. \nMa l\u2019assenza dalla scena gastronomica di Alfredo Di Lelio fu del tutto transitoria. Infatti nel 1948 riprese il controllo della sua tradizione familiare ed apr\u00ec, insieme al figlio Armando, il ristorante \u201cIl Vero Alfredo\u201d (noto all\u2019estero anche come \u201cAlfredo di Roma\u201d) in Piazza Augusto Imperatore n.30 (cfr. il sito web di Il Vero Alfredo).\nCon l\u2019avvio del nuovo ristorante Alfredo Di Lelio ottenne un forte successo di pubblico e di clienti negli anni della \u201cdolce vita\u201d. Successo, che, tuttora, richiama nel ristorante un flusso continuo di turisti da ogni parte del mondo per assaggiare le famose \u201cfettuccine all\u2019Alfredo\u201d al doppio burro da me servite, con \nl\u2019impegno di continuare nel tempo la tradizione familiare dei miei cari maestri, nonno Alfredo, mio padre Armando e mio fratello Alfredo. In particolare le fettuccine sono servite ai clienti con 2 \u201cposate d\u2019oro\u201d: una forchetta ed un cucchiaio d\u2019oro regalati nel 1927 ad Alfredo dai due noti attori americani M. Pickford e D. Fairbanks (in segno di gratitudine per l\u2019ospitalit\u00e0).\nDesidero precisare che altri ristoranti \u201cAlfredo\u201d a Roma non appartengono e sono fuori dal mio brand di famiglia.\nIl brand \u201cIl Vero Alfredo \u2013 Alfredo di Roma\u201d \u00e8 presente in Messico con un ristorante  a Citt\u00e0 del Messico e una trattoria a Cozumel sulla base di rapporti di franchising con il Group Hotel Presidente Intercontinental Mexico.   \nVi informo che il Ristorante \u201cIl Vero Alfredo\u201d \u00e8 presente nell\u2019Albo dei \u201cNegozi Storici di Eccellenza \u2013 sezione Attivit\u00e0 Storiche di Eccellenza\u201d del Comune di Roma Capitale.\n\nGrata per la Vostra attenzione ed ospitalit\u00e0 nel Vostro interessante blog, cordiali saluti\nInes Di Lelio\nInes Di LelioRome. Italy2/25/2022It is amazingly delicious if you make it right !!AnonymousBoston, MA9/25/2021I enjoyed Bon Appetit's pasta carbonara, so I decided to try other pasta dishes. This was disappointing, compared to the carbonara.AnonymousMountain View, CA9/9/2021A superb recipe. Just follow it and you will be ok. The thing is, you need good cheese and you need to whisk the butter and water vigorously to get a good emulsion. I also find letting the pasta sit in the sauce until it thickens is a more satisfying experience. BLMToronto. CA8/18/2021A few notes fir those who have issues with this recipe. This is an emulsion, not a cream sauce. It will not get thick but it will incorporate the butter into the pasta water so that it can coat the pasta (melted butter basically rolls off the pasta, an emulsion coats). The butter must be cold and cut into small pieces. Get the pasta water simmering and add all the butter at once then whisk gently until it becomes an emulsion take off the heat and add all at once. Whisk again until it joins the sauce. If you are cooking fresh pasta it can very quickly so you should use a lot less water than usual so the starch is concentrated. Once the cheese is melted, add the pasta and toss to coat. In the original Alfredo\u2019s restaurant this was prepared table side and truffles were shaved generously over it, which smells amazing and tastes fantastic. Alfredo should never have anything but pasta water, butter, and cheese in it. Make sure the cooking water has salt in it but remember part is salty. And do not use store bought grated cheese- it has chemicals to keep it from clumping and it will not melt properly. Only real parm from Italy!Martin EdicRochester, NY4/24/2021This recipe is ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. Tried the immersion blender technique too. Waste of time and energy . Anonymous4/23/2021This went poorly to say the leastAnonymousWisconsin4/2/2021I made this at the beginning of the pandemic and it was truly phenomenal. Absolutely amazing. But every time since then I can\u2019t get this to emulsify. The cheese becomes gluey or the sauce is clumpy. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a pan I\u2019m using or the cheese or what but I know it\u2019s my error. Love this recipe but I can\u2019t get it right 99% of the time. Regardless, butter and cheese on noodles never disappoints. Lauren Washington, DC3/31/2021I can\u2019t believe how easy it was. The flavor is second to none and I make this regularly now. Would definitely recommend using a higher quality Parmesan for the best flavor!Nancy from Cranston is GrossAustin3/29/2021Turned out beautifully! I have been cooking at home for years now and love experimenting, but by no means an expert. Just a home cook here! It turned out perfect on my first try whisking by hand. Great recipe and loved learning a new technique!Aneila BakerMcgaheysville, VA3/10/2021My god, this was delicious! I made a batch of duck egg & semolina pasta this morning, and was looking for a no-fuss dinner recipe to use it with. Turned out superbly! The sauce came together quickly, which I think was helped by the super starchy pasta water.  Do yourself a favour and be generous with your cheese.  I had a blend of parmesan and pecorino in the fridge... used  lot of it and have zero regrets. Thanks for the recipe, it's going straight into my favourites! Casey TAustralia3/6/2021Great recipe. It's basically wide noodle pasta, butter, and Parmigiana Reggiano in the salted pasta water with pepper. Agree, you need to stir this for a good two minutes until it emulsifies. By hand. Then add pepper. That's about it. Delicious. Not understanding how this is hard? It's way better than cream-based FA. I made it again tonight and it is a family favorite, couldn't be more simple. Added a chopped Roma and some grilled chicken.AnonymousSt Louis, MO3/6/2021I made this recipe with very high hopes. I had read reviews that it did not work out and followed their advise. I made sure the my cheese was completely well incorporated before adding more. I whisked like a m*****f***** my arm hurt but my sauce did not emulsify. A piece of advise (this is how I saved my sauce) if your sauce is not emulsifying but it into your blender and blend on medium speed for like 5-8 minutes then let it simmer back in your pan. The taste was alright but definitely not worth the pain in the  a** this recipe took to make. \n\n2.5/5  AnonymousLos Angeles, CA3/2/2021I do using a vintage parmesan (plenty) 120 months old.\nDelicious.PierinoModena, Italy2/7/2021I really have to say, I like it so much more with cream otherwise give me caico de pepeAnonymousNYC2/2/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titPastaItalian AmericanAmericanFettuccinePasta & NoodlesParmesanCheeseEasyQuickWeeknight Meals5 Ingredients or FewerMainVegetarianNut-FreeDinnerRecipes you want to make.
