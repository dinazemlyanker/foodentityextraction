In her monthly column, nearly lifelong vegetarian Sarah Jampel will tackle cooking, eating, and navigating the world meat-free\u2014even when her grandma still doesn't know what she makes for dinner.Whether you\u2019re having a vegetarian Thanksgiving or inviting a vegetarian to your Thanksgiving, you have my permission\u2014my blessing!\u2014to skip the fake turkey and even the savory tart, galette, vegetarian shepherd\u2019s pie, roasted vegetable lasagna, mushroom cassoulet, or cheese-stuffed pumpkin. Your table is, after all, already loaded with so many potentially vegetarian sides. But if you\u2019re going to rest on the laurels of sides alone, you have to strategize right.My vegetarian Thanksgiving strategy uses this matrix: orange, green, raw, wild card.Oh, come on: Don\u2019t feel bad for carby casseroles! They\u2019re vestiges of Thanksgivings past, made by default rather than desire, clinging on just because they can. I\u2019ve got nothing against stuffing, mashed potatoes, even green bean casserole as individual entities, but when they\u2019re all piled on my plate, butting heads, the meal is that awkward combination of unsatisfying and nap-inducing.Instead, I try to pick something orange (starchy and on the sweeter end), something green (savory, vegetal, takes well to garlic), something raw (for crunch and hydration), and something a tad mysterious (you have to keep the people guessing!).This year, it\u2019ll be Andy Baraghani\u2019s Charred Sweet Potatoes With Hot Honey Butter and Lime (orange), Broccolini With Sesame Sauce and Lemon (green), Chicory Salad with Honey Mustard Vinaigrette (raw), and Glazed Leeks with Pine Nut Salsa Verde (wildcard).When I\u2019m picking the recipes, I\u2019ll read them carefully, making sure there are make-ahead components for each (in this case, the sesame sauce, the honey-mustard vinaigrette, and the salsa verde), and that, for the most part, they\u2019re cool to hang out at room temperature. I don\u2019t want to be stressing out about how to put my side dish in the oven when my M.I.L. is monopolizing it with her turkey.With these constraints, the possibilities are plentiful! Let\u2019s say you don\u2019t want sweet potatoes for your something-orange: Go with Slow-Cooked Winter Squash with Sage and Thyme or Honeynut Squash with Radicchio and Miso or Harissa-and-Maple-Roasted Carrots. The greens could be green beans (obvious but beloved), kale, spinach, collard greens, or brussels sprouts. Chicories make for a festive, beautiful-by-default salad, but you could also use tender greens or even shaved root veg (this Ice Water Salad is perfect for making ahead) or fennel. The wildcard slot is there so you can try something fun, like Parsnip Confit With Pickled Currants or Cheesy Cabbage Gratin or Glazed Shallots with Chile and Thyme.The goal is for my plate to end up looking like it would on any exceptionally good cooking day of the year\u2014tons of vegetables of various preparations, some for bulk and some for freshness, with lots of flavorful sauces and accompaniments. Turkey\u2019s welcome here, but definitely not necessary. And while my family can make stuffing if they really want to, they won\u2019t miss it once they taste the new crew.But let\u2019s say you\u2019re not hosting. Or that your family won\u2019t budge from the trio of carbs (mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, stuffing) passing as vegetarian sides. Offer to make or bring just one recipe that will offer some contrast, substantive enough that a big bowl of it will keep you satiated: Maybe that\u2019s a crunchy radicchio salad with squash and pecan vinaigrette or wild rice with mushrooms and leeks.When all else fails, what helps me is to remind myself that this is one meal of the year. So what if my plate is full of stuffing and I need to lie down before dessert? There\u2019s always dinner tomorrow.Explore Bon App\u00e9titThe Not Depressing VegetarianThanksgivingVegetarianRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
