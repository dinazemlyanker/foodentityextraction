Every time I see the latest cartoon she\u2019s illustrated, I\u2019m more convinced. A little sad, a little snarky, and very smart, they hit uncomfortably close to home for me and for the many others who follow her on Instagram, read her in the New Yorker, and buy her books. She puts to paper (and to the world) the sorts of thoughts that us timid folk can\u2019t or won\u2019t articulate. And no topic, including food, is spared.These alternative food pyramids, exploring all the idiosyncratic ways that we eat and the stories we tell ourselves about our consumption, are just one example of her incisive wit. They\u2019re simultaneously more and less real than the USDA food guide pyramid some of us remember from school\u2014as well as much funnier and, quite frankly, just as useful.
