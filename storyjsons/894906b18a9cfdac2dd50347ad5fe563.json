The tender Tepary beans and crumbles of goat cheese remind him of his Navajo roots. The beans are native to the Sonoran Desert, and goats are essential for food and clothing for Din\u00e9 people. Dandelion greens are a local Minneapolis species that elder Hope Flanagan of Dream of Wild Health farm recently showed him and his team how to forage for. In his recipe, Yazzie seeks out the brown varieties of the Tepary beans\u2014he loves the ones from Ramona Farms\u2014because they excel at holding their shape and are native to the American Southwest. To balance their creaminess and the dandelion greens\u2019 bitterness, he uses a combination of cranberries and sumac to create a bright, acidic vinaigrette.Ingredients4 ServingsDressing1scallion\u00bdcup extra-virgin olive oil or sunflower oil2sprigs mint1garlic clove\u00bdcup unsweetened cranberry juice or 1 cup fresh or frozen cranberries1Tbsp. sumac, preferably wild American2tsp. honey1\u00bdtsp. onion powder\u00bctsp. freshly ground black pepperKosher saltBeans and assembly2Tbsp. amaranth (optional)1\u00bdcups drained cooked brown tepary or other beansKosher salt6cups dandelion or turnip greens (from about 1 bunch)1cup microgreens (optional)2oz. fresh goat cheese, crumbledPreparationDressingStep 1Separate dark green top from scallion and chop.

We went a bit heavy on the micro greens (pea shoots) and skipped the amaranth as we didn\u2019t have it on hand. The The dressing was great though I think using cranberries instead of cranberry juice would\u2019ve been better. Pairs well with salmon for dinner!AnonymousSt Paul, MN5/4/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladNative AmericanAmericanSumacHerbs & SpicesBeanVegetableGoat CheeseCheeseQuickEasyWeeknight MealsMainSideNut-FreeGluten-FreeVegetarianLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
