Unlike crushed or diced tomatoes, our favorite brands of whole peeled tomatoes don\u2019t include additional ingredients besides salt (there\u2019s no calcium chloride, which helps tomato chunks stay firm, or \u201cadded pure\u0301e,\u201d which imparts a weird thickness).But there\u2019s one type of canned tomato we rarely talk about, and those are fire-roasted. The silence ends now: As it turns out, they have their time and place to shine.Fire-roasted tomatoes are exactly what they sound like: the tomatoes are charred over a flame before they're  diced and canned (sometimes, they're also enhanced with onion and garlic powder). Often, you can actually see the blackened flecks on the tomatoes. Contact with the flame brings out the tomatoes\u2019 sweetness and, most notably, imparts a distinct smokiness. Essentially, it\u2019s a shortcut to more flavor.Photo by Laura MurrayIn Rick Martinez\u2019s chicken tinga tostadas, smokiness is essential for balancing out the fat in the bacon-y refried beans, the sharpness of the raw onion, and the creamy sprinkling of cheese on top. Sure, you could use whole peeled tomatoes, but the end result would not be nearly as dynamic. With everything else going on in the tostadas, it\u2019s a subtle flavor\u2014but certainly a noticeable one. (Fun fact: In a side-by-side taste test, Cook's Illustrated found a smoky salsa made from fire-roasted tomatoes to be significantly more complex and delicious than one made with regular diced tomatoes!)If you don\u2019t have fire-roasted tomatoes on hand, definitely don\u2019t attempt to char your own. The truth is, regular canned tomatoes will work fine as a substitute. You can even add a pinch of smoked paprika to make up for it.But the next time you\u2019re at the grocery store, grab a can of fire-roasted tomatoes to keep in your pantry. When you decide to make those tostadas or a smoky salsa, or you want to doctor up your usual chili, you\u2019ll be glad to have it.Get the recipe:Chicken Tinga Tostadas With Bacony Black BeansEverything you could possibly want in a tostada (and then some): shredded chicken smothered with a smoky, spicy tomato salsa, bacony refried beans, and a smattering of cilantro and cheese.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titTomatoCanned TomatoesRecipes you want to make.
