If you want to fill your kitchen with the smell of fresh-baked bread but you're nervous about shaping a boule or working with a starter, focaccia is the best place to begin. We're not exaggerating when we say it requires zero skill and provides ample opportunity to be amazed by yourself and by the wonders of yeast. Letting the dough do its first rise in the fridge for 8\u201324 hours (like, while you're working or sleeping) means improved flavor and ease of handling. If you don\u2019t feel like waiting that long (we get it), leave it covered at room temperature until doubled in size, 3\u20134 hours. And even if you skip the garlic butter, this will still make for spectacular sandwich bread. Have more questions?

Diamond Crystal or 1 Tbsp. Morton kosher salt6Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more for hands4Tbsp. unsalted butter, plus more for panFlaky sea salt2\u20134garlic clovesPreparationStep 1Whisk one \u00bc-oz. envelope active dry yeast (about 2\u00bc tsp.), 2 tsp. honey, and 2\u00bd cups lukewarm water in a medium bowl and let sit 5 minutes (it should foam or at least get creamy; if it doesn\u2019t your yeast is dead and you should start again\u2014check the expiration date!).Step 2Add 5 cups (625 g) all-purpose flour and 5 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 Tbsp. Morton kosher salt and mix with a rubber spatula until a shaggy dough forms and no dry streaks remain.Step 3Pour 4 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil into a big bowl that will fit in your refrigerator. This puppy is going to rise! Transfer dough to bowl and turn to coat in oil. Cover with a silicone lid or plastic wrap and chill until dough is doubled in size (it should look very bubbly and alive), at least 8 hours and up to 1 day. If you're in a rush, you can also let it rise at room temperature until doubled in size, 3\u20134 hours.Step 4Generously butter a 13x9\" baking pan, for thicker focaccia that\u2019s perfect for sandwiches, or an 18x13\" rimmed baking sheet, for focaccia that's thinner, crispier, and great for snacking. The butter may seem superfluous, but it\u2019ll ensure that your focaccia doesn\u2019t stick. Pour 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil into center of pan. Keeping the dough in the bowl and using a fork in each hand, gather up edges of dough farthest from you and lift up and over into center of bowl. Give the bowl a quarter turn and repeat process. Do this 2 more times; you want to deflate dough while you form it into a rough ball. (We learned this technique from Alexandra Stafford, who uses it to shape her no-knead bread.) Transfer dough to prepared pan. Pour any oil left in bowl over and turn dough to coat it in oil. Let rise, uncovered, in a dry, warm spot (like near a radiator or on top of the fridge or a preheating oven) until doubled in size, at least 1\u00bd hours and up to 4 hours.Step 5Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 450\u00b0. To see if the dough is ready, poke it with your finger. It should spring back slowly, leaving a small visible indentation. If it springs back quickly, the dough isn\u2019t ready. (If at this point the dough is ready to bake but you aren\u2019t, you can chill it up to 1 hour.) Lightly oil your hands. If using a rimmed baking sheet, gently stretch out dough to fill (you probably won't need to do this if using a baking pan). Dimple focaccia all over with your fingers, like you\u2019re aggressively playing the piano, creating very deep depressions in the dough (reach your fingers all the way to the bottom of the pan). Drizzle with remaining 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Bake focaccia until puffed and golden brown all over, 20\u201330 minutes.Step 6Hold off on this last step until you're ready to serve the focaccia: Melt 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat. Peel and grate in 2\u20134 garlic cloves with a Microplane (use 2 cloves if you\u2019re garlic-shy or up to 4 if you love it). Return to medium heat and cook, stirring often, until garlic is just lightly toasted, 30\u201345 seconds. (Or, if you prefer raw garlic to toasted garlic, you can grate the garlic into the hot butter, off heat, then brush right away.)Step 7Brush garlic-butter all over focaccia and slice into squares or rectangles.Step 8Do Ahead:  Focaccia is best eaten the day it's made, but keeps well in the freezer. Slice it into pieces, store it in a freezer-safe container, then reheat it on a baking sheet in a 300\u00b0 F oven.How would you rate Shockingly Easy No-Knead Focaccia?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (374)Back to TopTriangleOh, Lord, I could smell that garlic and bread right off the page! It's my grandmother's recipe, Pasqualina Membrino - da Napoli. The only thing missing is the anchovies. But, I took care of that! A whole can later. And, you do NOT grate the garlic, you poke a hole in the dough as it is ready in the pan and poke a chunk of garlic down the hole! (Oh, Lord, I can smell it now - to die for!)Carolyn Franklin (Carolina)Fitchburg, MA3/22/2022Absolutely delicious.  We didn\u2019t refrigerate dough.  To excited. Left it out in warm area for 4 hours.   Easy instructions.  I added herbs when I put it on cookie sheet.    I sent pictures to my friends to show off this spectacular bread.   \nOnly issue was trying to print recipe to make again \u263a\ufe0fDonna LinsleyOrange; CT 3/13/2022This bread is so amazing! the whole house smells divine! i thought I did something wrong because the mix was so stick and sloppy but it worked out perfectly and yummy! I added rosemary and the garlic butter on top is so good!\nRobynOregon3/5/2022This Foccacia was great! I will rate this 5/5Jaeyoung ChongSeoul, South Korea3/1/2022I tried to 0.75x this recipe and think I totally added too much water and messed up in my calculations BUT it still turned out REMARKABLY well and I highly recommend this recipe. Next time, going to make the full portion.Abbie Smith2/27/2022So good. I was slightly rushed, so pulled out of the fridge at just over 7 hours, and then proofed in front of a space heater for just about 2 hours and it came out DELIGHTFUL. Skipped the garlic butter, but did add caramelized onions and rosemary to the top just before baking and, damn, this is tasty. DanaWashington, DC2/26/2022This turned out great!  I did not need the final 1 tbsp olive oil (in step 5) because there was so much in the pan still, so I just spooned that on top.  I recommend adding rosemary. lonnrotWashington, DC2/23/2022This is, indeed, shockingly easy. I used 3 cups French bread flour (T65) and 2 cups Italian 00, because I read that I'd get a great crumb by mixing the two.  The results were splendid.  Best focaccia I have EVER tasted, and organic to boot.  Amazing.  Before baking, I scattered some thyme, black greek olives and a caramelized, thinly sliced onion before drizzling that last bit of oil.  Oh. My.StrongEagleSouth of France2/15/2022First off, I am not a baker This recipe turns out beautifully every time I make it. It is easy and pretty forgiving. I have done the slow refrigerator proof, and used the proof option on my oven. Perfect regardless. Great recipe, especially for non-bakers .MaryRed Oak, NC2/13/2022MehJane doe2/11/2022Hot shzzz\nMan, does this recipe deliver. Give it the time in the fridge and out. One of the best things I\u2019ve eaten in a long time.Colleen Chicago 2/8/2022The recipe is wonderful but the adds and pop up side videos are really, really poorly placed.  It's very difficult to read the recipe.  Not sure why it's not formatted correctly for my browser.  Anonymousalbuquerque, NM2/7/2022I made this today.  Very easy recipe to follow.  I am pleased with how it turned out.  It was my first attempt at focaccia and it was delicious.   JoAnn HCaif.2/7/2022My indoor ambient humidity here in Seattle in late winter is in the high 40's/low 50's. 2 1/2 cups of water yielded a dough closer to what I look for when I'm making scones. I added nearly 1/2 cup additional water before I had a dough that resembled what we see in the video and what I recognize from my previous experience making focaccia. \n\nThat said, this recipe was wonderful! I let it proof in the fridge for a full 24 hours. I also got distracted with tiling my bathroom and my pan of focaccia sat for 5 hours before I even remembered that I needed to preheat the oven, but it was very forgiving and still was hugely successful. I took it to a party and people couldn't stop talking about it!\n\nAlso, your website is super buggy and annoying.DrNurseHeatherSeattle, WA2/6/2022UGH! UGH! I don't believe in paying for a recipe.
