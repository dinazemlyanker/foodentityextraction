There\u2019s just something about the way the lightweight mesh bags look and feel\u2014swishy, creamy, soft\u2014that makes people stop and comment on how lovely they are. I\u2019m surprised no one\u2019s reached out to stroke them yet, considering they\u2019re almost as tempting to touch as that fluffy pink insulation material (which you definitely should not).I get great pleasure in treating my produce with such TLC: When I put apples or sweet potatoes or teeny Sungold tomatoes in the bags, it\u2019s like I\u2019m tucking them into bed or buckling them into a car seat. I know fruits and vegetables don\u2019t have feelings but come on: They must prefer it this way. The bags come in a variety of sizes, so there\u2019s one that\u2019ll cradle a bunch of herbs and another that will keep two handfuls of cherries from rolling around. I figure that if I select my produce with care and shepherd them in an earth-friendly fashion (rather than shoving them into the same type of plastic bags I reserve for cat litter and dirty gym clothes), then I\u2019m also bound to put them to good use. Spring farmers\u2019 market, here I come.Photo by Chelsie CraigPurifYou Reusable Produce Bags (Set of 9)$15 $10 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendShoppingRecipes you want to make.
