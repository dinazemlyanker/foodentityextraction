See our past recommendations here!I bought Embryolisse Lait Cr\u00e8me Concentre for the first time in 2011, when I lived in Paris for a year and spent all my babysitting money on French creams that I read about on blogs but had no use for. When I got home to New York, I put it in my medicine cabinet and didn't use it until 2014, the year my skin became the worst version of itself and I went on Accutane. For six months, I popped three pills a day that obliterated my acne but made my skin drier than a desert.The only moisturizer that worked for me during that time of peeling skin and chapped everything was Embryolisse, whose thick, globby-in-a-good-way texture made my face as soft as a baby's. My skin is less sensitive now, but I still buy a new tube every winter and apply a pea-sized amount right after I shower in the morning. It's the ideal cold weather moisturizer, shielding against the blistering wind and overheated office buildings that wreck havoc on my skin. \u2014Elaheh Nozari, associate director of affiliateBuy it: Embryolisse Lait Cr\u00e8me Concentre, $28All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
