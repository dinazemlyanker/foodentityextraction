There\u2019s really no way to avoid bruising the mint when blitzing it to a paste in a blender, so don\u2019t be alarmed when this pesto turns a forest-green color. Any leftover pesto will happily transform deeply roasted root vegetables into something worthy of center stage. This recipe is from Montreal\u2019s cozy-cool coffee-pizza-wine restaurant Elena.IngredientsMakes about \u00be cup\u2154cup raw pistachios\u2154cup extra-virgin olive oil1tsp. kosher salt\u00bctsp. freshly ground black pepper2cups (packed) mint leaves, plus more small leaves for serving\u00bdoz. finely grated Parmesan (about \u00bd cup)\u00bdlemonPreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 350\u00b0.

It was for lamb meatballs & mint pesto. Sorry ToonooSyr ny10/25/2021Loved it!   One bite might get you a little more garlic, another more mint, even the parsley is a nice surprise and the  the raisin . I was told to keep this one so it just wasn\u2019t me.making it was easy & baking it made it not greasy.ToonooSyr ny10/25/2021Very good, very easy pesto, perfect for a quick summer dinner. I halved the recipe, subbed basil for mint since that's what I had, and tossed with pasta and it turned out delicious! Want to try again with mint. AnonymousPhiladelphia8/1/2021Came here to say DO NOT SKIP OUT ON THE LEMON! Step 3 read like an optional garnish/flourish for me, but it wasn\u2019t until I added about half a lemon\u2019s worth of juice that the flavors fully came together with that irresistible \u201clet me just try one more bite\u201d quality. The flavors meld even more as it sits in the fridge.
