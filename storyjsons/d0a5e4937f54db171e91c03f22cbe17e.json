He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.If you\u2019ve ever wondered what to do with all that zucchini piled up at the farmers market, this pasta is what.It\u2019s the kind of dish you really can\u2019t screw up. And it will make all the zucchini haters out there (paging Carla Lalli Music) demand to know how you transformed a relatively bland, somewhat watery vegetable into something so deeply flavorful and\u2014while I really don\u2019t like this word I\u2019m gonna use it anyway\u2014truly unctuous.The trick is to cook down the chopped-up zucchini until it\u2019s almost unrecognizable, or what David Chang might refer to as \u201cugly delicious.\u201d In the case of this recipe, the more ugly, the more better. (Please see my iPhone photo, below.)Lately, I\u2019ve been describing the texture of the finished dish as \u201csludgy,\u201d though you may want to follow the lead of Chris Morocco, who developed the recipe, and call it \u201cjammy.\u201d In this age of the jammy egg, everyone likes jammy.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Garlicky oil and a liberal amount of salt infuse the zucchini (or yellow summer squash) with flavor, while pasta water and grated parm finish it off. I also like to add a knob of butter at this point because, well, butter.In Chris\u2019 recipe, the zucchini takes on depth thanks to a generous amount of fresh basil, another farmers market staple this time of year. But I take my cue from Ruthie Rogers of London\u2019s River Cafe, who cooks a similar dish. She opts for fresh mint, stirring in a handlful while the zucchini cooks down, and then another handful, just before serving, once the pasta is incorporated into the sauce.My only other deviation from Chris\u2019 recipe is timing. Chris calls for about 15 minutes of cooking time for the zucchini; I go for double that. I want my zucchini extra sludgy\u2014excuse me, jammy.Get the recipe:Summer Squash and Basil PastaSaut\u00e9ed squash eventually gets jammy and saucy if cooked long enough, ideal as a way to coat big pieces of pasta.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titZucchiniPastaAdam NewsletterRead MorecookingThis Marinated Zucchini Situation Is My Favorite Thing About SummerBy Emily SchultzLifestyleThis Sweet and Spicy Grilled Squash Goes Out to All the Vegetarians at the BarbecueBy Aliza AbarbanelcookingThe Kinda-Healthy Kale Pasta I Can Always Count OnBy Elyse InamineRecipes you want to make.
