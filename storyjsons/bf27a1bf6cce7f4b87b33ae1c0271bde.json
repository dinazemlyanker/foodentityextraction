But I draw the line at equating self-care with supposedly virtuous or \u201cclean\u201d eating, as countless articles and Instagram accounts insinuate. Comfort eating can be self-care too; it's not a crutch, or a sign that you don't eat enough vegetables, but rather a totally acceptable balm to bad days and crummy moods.Enter chicken parm.My childhood dentist was located in a mall. After getting my teeth cleaned, my mom would take me to the food court, where I would beeline to Sbarro and order the chicken parm that was sitting out in metal warming trays for who knows how long. The side of spaghetti was overcooked, the breaded chicken was eerily soft in a way I loved, the cheese was plentiful. Everything about it was mushy and perfect for my recently bleeding gums.Over the years I learned to recognize that a crispy chicken cutlet was superior to a mushy Sbarro one (though I\u2019m still not above ordering Sbarro at a rest stop). Chicken parm became my go-to order anytime I was at an Italian-American restaurant, and especially when I found myself at a diner.I\u2019ve eaten a lot of chicken parms throughout Westchester, New York, when visiting my maternal grandparents\u2014diners were places where they felt at ease because my grandmother could order a meal with no salt (\u201cThat\u2019s no salt, whatsoever,\u201d repeated to the waiter at least four times), and my grandfather could order something extremely salty, as a respite from my grandmother\u2019s bland cooking. As my grandfather aged, bedridden by the end, my family would often end up in a diner after visiting him. He wasn\u2019t eating much anymore, but I still found that a copious amount of breadcrumbs soothed my soul.About three years after my grandfather died, I got sick. My Crohn\u2019s disease dramatically worsened, and I was being fed nutrients via a PICC line (essentially an on-the-go IV) for several weeks. My stomach was in such intense pain that I was pretty much medically instructed to stop eating.Dealing with pain, and having tubes attached to your right arm for several weeks, is hard for anyone. But for someone whose job it is to oversee a culinary website, it\u2019s a pretty bizarre experience to literally not be able to eat. I would wake up, spend some time curled in a fetal position, get to the office late, hide in a closet filled with old magazines and video equipment to clean my IV lines, and attempt to create a strategic launch plan for our new website vertical in between.Eventually, I had surgery and slowly recovered in about a three-week process. My appetite returned, first in fits and starts and then with a vengeance\u2014I wanted to eat everything that I hadn\u2019t been able to: smash burgers, steak, all the pasta. And I needed chicken parm.A few weeks post-recovery, I went to the gastroenterologist for an \u201call clear\u201d visit. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in that office in the past decade\u2014chronic inflammatory diseases will do that to you. On my way back from my frequent visits, I\u2019d often stop at a diner, Eat Here Now, on 64th and Lex, before taking the F train back to Brooklyn. There\u2019s something uncomfortably oxymoronic about eating a big meal after having a gastrointestinal-related appointment, yet I found the hum of the diner calming when it just felt like my body wasn\u2019t working right. (Please spare me the lecture about the foods you should or shouldn\u2019t eat when you have Crohn\u2019s\u2014I\u2019ve tried it all.)And it seems odd to get emotional over chicken parm. But the all-clear visit was a big health milestone\u2014I had just been told I could resume a relatively normal diet. So I mini-celebrated at Eat Here Now. There I was, eating a solo dinner at 5:30 p.m. among an almost exclusively geriatric crowd, holding back tears while diving into a $17.95 plate of melty cheese and slightly dry white meat. It felt good to have an appetite, to eat without physical pain, to have agency over what I chose to put in my body.That was two years ago. I haven\u2019t been back to that diner since, but my chicken parm quest has continued at other diners and restaurants, most recently back in Scarsdale, where my grandmother ordered a broccoli omelet with no salt (\u201cThat\u2019s no salt. I don\u2019t want any salt.\u201d). At 91, she\u2019s getting forgetful these days, and tends to repeat herself a lot. It\u2019s annoying, and frustrating, and ultimately depressing.But maybe there\u2019s some solace in the repetition\u2014after all, I eat the same diner meal with her that I have since forever. Her food will be bland, and she\u2019ll always remark how she\u2019ll never be able to finish; my chicken will be massive, yet I\u2019ll always eat more than I intended.I get that chicken parm doesn\u2019t actually cure anything\u2014I still have Crohn\u2019s, my grandmother is still declining, and I still have bleeding gums when I go to the dentist. But I can\u2019t deny its role as a mild panacea\u2014one that has been there for me more regularly than pretty much any other self-care attempt (I\u2019m looking at you, $40 salt cave visit).And that\u2019s the point of self-care, right? To do what makes your body and mind feel good. Which, for me, is all the obvious stuff like yoga and reading for pleasure...mixed with the occasional too-big portion of chicken cutlet, tomato sauce, and melted cheese.Carey Polis is the digital director at Bon App\u00e9tit.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsItalian AmericanRed SauceRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
