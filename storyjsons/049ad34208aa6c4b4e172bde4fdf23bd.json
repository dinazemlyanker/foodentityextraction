But, I\u2019m open-minded.Well, I became opened-minded once I laid eyes on senior food editor Chris Morocco\u2019s pineapple-glazed ham during a photo shoot for our December holiday issue. There it was in all its 10 pounds of shiny glory, lacquered with a spicy, vinegary glaze that I could smell from a mile away and luxuriating in the middle of a propped-out table. I watched as half of it was sliced so thinly that the tender, juicy pieces kind of just flopped over the burnished orange and pineapple rounds, like a well-executed hair flip. For the first time in my life, I felt the call of the ham\u2014and a deep urge to make it.Chris said it needed to be \u201cgood quality,\u201d so I spent days searching for the right one. Would \u201cmaple\u201d curing flavor would affect the recipe? It wouldn\u2019t, Chris assured me. Is it okay if it\u2019s labelled \u201cuncured\u201d? It was, he soothed. \u201cUncured and cured, it just means no nitrates are added. Unless it\u2019s a fresh ham, which you don\u2019t want to use, you can\u2019t go wrong with either.\u201dDays passed as I waited for my 6-pound, boneless, maple-cured prize from Heritage Foods to arrive (that\u2019s what Chris used when he developed the recipe). Then, it finally did. On a Wednesday. At 6 p.m. And because I couldn\u2019t wait any longer, I immediately got to work.I laid out a few long strips of foil (key), layered slices of pineapple and orange, placed the ham on top of the fruit, and then tightly wrapped the foil around it. (FYI, the fruit will all slide to the bottom of the foil and get piled up underneath the ham, which is totally fine.) Instead of using the fruit as a scary garnish, making it a \u201cDonna Hay fantasyland/shingled armadillo ham,\u201d as Chris described it, he decided to imbue the ham with those classic flavors by creating a citrusy steam room for it. \u201cI wanted to treat the ham the way it deserved to be treated,\u201d he says. A-M-E-N.During the three-hour steam session, I made the glaze. It\u2019s just jarred pineapple juice, apple cider vinegar, brown sugar, and hot sauce (I went with Cholula), which makes for a complex, spicy, not-too-sweet combo. Then I kicked back, read a book, scrolled Instagram\u2014the cooking was that hands-off! Imagine the next family gathering and how you could use all those hours to sneak away and destress a bit, then come back to unleash a showstopping centerpiece that will really bring everyone together. Joy to the world!So dreamy.\nAfter the three hours was up (yeah, it was getting late), I cranked up the oven to 425\u00b0 and unfurled the foil. For the next 12 minutes, I brushed the glaze over the ham every three minutes\u2014it\u2019s worth it\u2014until it had the same black lacquered look as the first ham I fell in love with. (If it\u2019s not getting dark, it\u2019s probably because it\u2019s not caramelizing correctly. You\u2019ll need to reduce your glaze a bit more, which I ended up having to do.) Once the ham took on that perfect hue, I let it rest. This. Is. Key. Do. Not. Skip. \u201cMake sure you let it rest for at least 30 minutes to an hour,\u201d Chris says. \u201cThis preserves its juiciness, and that\u2019s entertaining insurance.\u201dWhile it rested, I spread out the fruit and roasted it for about 25 minutes longer, spooning all the hammy-citrusy juices over the top every so often, until the edges turned a burnt-toast color. I arranged the fruit on my favorite platter, dotting it with some maraschino cherries (I went with fancy Stonewall Kitchen ones, but even the neon-red ones are fine here). Then I carved out thin slices of the ham, blush pink and so moist it almost looked sweaty, and laid them one by one on the platter. Proudly, I presented it to my husband at 11 p.m. Christmas had come early. Then I couldn\u2019t restrain myself anymore and started dropping the slices straight into my mouth. It was then that I truly understood the allure of pineapple-glazed ham.Get the recipe:Pineapple-Glazed HamWe spiked the glaze for our retro-chic version of 1950s-style ham with hot sauce and apple cider vinegar to cut through the sweetness.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titholiday2018HamChristmasRead MorecookingYour Big Holiday Dinner Should Be a Roast Beef Sandwich SpreadBy Alex BeggscultureThe Formula for a Memorable Holiday PartyBy Adam RapoportcookingThis Overnight French Toast Casserole Is a Holiday Breakfast as Exciting as PRESENTSSSSBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
