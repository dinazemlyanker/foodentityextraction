This powerful, professional-grade blender very rarely goes on sale, but right now, it\u2019s 49% off for Amazon Prime Day.Vitamix 5200 Blender Professional-Grade, Self-Cleaning 64 oz Container, Black - 001372$550 $379 at AmazonCalphalon Cookware SetSenior food editor Christina Chaey is partial to teeniest Calphalon stainless-steel pot; maximalists can go for this eight-piece set of normal-size pots.

Warm your espresso cup on the heating tray while you use the included conical burr grinder to get just the right coarseness of grind, then whip the perfect silky foam and pull a shot. This hefty, gorgeous thing rarely goes on sale\u2014and right now, it\u2019s 33% off.\u00a0Calphalon Temp IQ Espresso Machine$680 at AmazonWeber Propane GrillWeber is pretty much synonymous with Good Grill for a reason. This dependable propane model heats up quickly, has reversible cast-iron grill grates (flip to the smaller side for small fiddly food like vegetables and shrimp), and is easy to assemble.Weber Propane Grill$569 at AmazonCuisinart Air FryerWe love crispy-gone-soggy, but sometimes we also just love crispy, crispy, crispy. Cue the air fryer.

Save 50% this Amazon Prime Day.\u00a0Instant Pot Duo Plus, 6 Quart$120 $50 at AmazonCoravinThe fact that wine bottles are the size they are is a cruel, cruel thing for anyone who lives alone. Sometimes you just want a glass with dinner without the stress spiral about whether or not the wine will go off before you\u2019re able to finish it. Enter the Coravin. Unlike the simple (and imperfect) physical barrier an average stopper provides, the Coravin replaces wine with argon gas as you pour, preventing what\u2019s left from oxidizing.\u00a0Coravin Wine Opener and Preserver$165 at AmazonAeroGardenLast year, every single one of your friends successfully sprouted their spring onion cuttings and stuck an old potato in a pot.

The brand\u2019s knives are already a great value, but today and tomorrow, take an additional 20% off.Misen Chef's Knife$75 at AmazonBreville Joule Sous VideIMHO, a sous vide is the ideal to getting a medium-rare steak done on a cast-iron skillet without setting off the fire alarm. Stick that steak in a vacuum bag (or one of these Stashers, also on sale!) alongside some aromatics, and go about your business as the inside is cooked to ideal pinkness. A quick finishing sear in the pan and you\u2019re done. No fire department visits required.\u00a0Breville Joule Sous Vide Machine$250 $160 at AmazonGooseneck KettleCan you even call yourself a coffee person if you don\u2019t methodically douse your French press grounds in tidy little concentric circles of 195\u00b0F water?

Or, you could replace the spices in your parents\u2019 home with use-by dates that correspond to your birth year\u2026or both!\u00a0Spicewalla Middle Eastern Spices Set$55 $44 at AmazonGE Profile Opal Nugget Ice MakerA $550 ice maker is absurd. A $450 ice maker? I\u2019m listening\u2026. Yes, this ice machine is still quite the splurge, but it makes \u201cthe good ice,\u201d that crunchy, chewable, airy ice that people go nuts for. If you\u2019re going to make one totally-unnecessary-but-totally-worth-it purchase this Amazon Prime Day, let it be this.GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker$529 $499 at AmazonFoodSaver Vacuum SealerPreserve those chicken cutlets better, longer by vacuum sealing them into a shrink-wrapped airless coffin.
