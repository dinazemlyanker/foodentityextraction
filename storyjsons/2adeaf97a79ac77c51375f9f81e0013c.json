I made the strangest soup (think shrimp, harissa, potatoes, leeks), burnt an entire batch of granola for the first time in years, and didn\u2019t put on jeans even once (I ditched that goal).But I also attended a Zoom bachelorette party, watched my husband play virtual trivia, crossed the Brooklyn Bridge by foot, made banana bread and bread-bread on the same day, listened to hours of the \u201c2000s throwbacks\u201d Spotify playlist, received a contactless delivery of gummy bears and chili oil from a great friend, and discussed the merits of expeller-pressed oils at length with my BA colleagues.Amid all this, I was bopping around the kitchen, and wanted to share a few hopefully helpful thoughts. Here it goes!Want this letter before it hits the website?

But I find it\u2019s most convenient when my spoons roam freely. They\u2019re easier to reach for and put to use, and the whole set doesn\u2019t get dirty thanks to one oily interloper.If you\u2019re in the market for a new set, I recommend this one from OXO because the spoons nest together magnetically: No one gets lost but each member has independence.Photo and Food Styling by Sarah Jampel\u00a0Best Thing I Ate Last WeekRoasted Veg Loves Dressing, TooHonestly, last week I mostly ate matzo in various forms: matzo brei with parm and black pepper, matzo \u201clasagna\u201d with spinach, lemon, feta, and mozzarella, matzo \u201cpizza\u201d (the key to preventing sog is to melt a layer of cheese on first, then add the sauce). But I also received a delivery of a ton of root vegetables\u2014parsnips, beets, carrots, potatoes\u2014from a local farm.Normally I season my vegetables pre-roasting, with olive oil, ground or crushed spices, and salt, but considering I\u2019ve got so many to get through, I\u2019ve started dressing them after, in addition. Roasted veg can be dressed just like salad greens, taking kindly to vinaigrettes and creamy dressings. I made a nuoc cham dressing for my carrots, then used the leftovers to dress roasted sweet potatoes and cauliflower later in the week, too.Moment of AppreciationMy Favorite (Free!) AppIf you already know about the \u201cMeasure\u201d app on iPhones, do you love it? If you don\u2019t already know about it, are you prepared to have your mind blown? All you have to do is open the app and wave your phone up and down like a weirdo for a few seconds, and then you can measure ANYTHING. That\u2019s right: You\u2019ll never have to wonder how big your loaf pan is (and why on earth it isn\u2019t labeled!). In a moment of real boredom, I even measured my two cats from nose to tail to compare the two (one is a half foot longer).Photo and Food styling by Sarah Jampel\u00a0This Week I\u2019m Going To...Try to track down rhubarb, my most beloved fruit* besides quinceProbably (and sadly) finish all four seasons of Please Like Me, an Australian TV show that aired from 2013 to 2016; it makes me cringe as much as it makes me laugh\u2014I\u2019ve zipped through it and I\u2019ll be sad to finishDo some pi\u00f1ata research (I\u2019ve got big plans for a future b-day celebration for a friend); any advice welcome!Turn the chipotles in adobo hanging out in the fridge into a spicy dipMake at least one hot breakfast, probably using my sourdough discardSend a couple of get well cards in the mailSee you here next week!*Technically a member of the buckwheat family, rhubarb was declared a fruit in 1947 by the U.S. Customs Court to reflect its culinary use.
