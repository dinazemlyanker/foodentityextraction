We\u2019re sitting in a brown leather booth at Sergio\u2019s with my new stepdad. My soft-bodied doll named Dolly is on my lap. We\u2019ve ordered a large pizza\u2014half cheese, half sausage and peppers\u2014and maybe we\u2019ve gone to the salad bar for our iceberg lettuce and our pickled antipasti, or maybe we haven\u2019t gotten there yet. In any case, we\u2019re sitting together like a real family because that\u2019s what we are now, but my mom\u2019s face is filled with pain. She holds her stomach and tells us she can\u2019t be here, she has to go lie down in the car. But when she tries to stand, she falls down.I remember the red-tinted hard plastic cup full of ice water, how the surface was pebbly under my hands.There\u2019s a back room at Sergio\u2019s, windowless and white, ideal for kids\u2019 birthday parties, sports teams, and any other group that requires space and privacy but not ambiance or light. This is where I sit with Dolly and a nice woman with dirty blonde hair while my stepfather calls an ambulance, while the ambulance sits in the parking lot, spilling red light across the dining room like a disco ball gone rogue, while the EMTs put my mother on a stretcher and drive her away.Do they bring me my pizza? Do I eat it?Later at the hospital, my mom says, \u201cI was a little bit pregnant, but I\u2019m not any more,\u201d and I feel sad that I won\u2019t have a half-sibling but happy that she\u2019s okay, though I won\u2019t understand what happened for years after that.1998We\u2019re sitting in that windowless back room even though we\u2019re only six people\u2014my parents and me and three of my best friends\u2014and it\u2019s good we\u2019re back here because my friends are being extremely, piercingly loud, the way only 12-going-on-13-year-old girls can be. We\u2019re here because it\u2019s my birthday, but my friends don\u2019t seem to care. They\u2019re lost in a spiral of inside jokes, one leading to another to another, snorting birch beer from their noses, choking on mouthfuls of pepperoni pizza, laughing so hard that no sound comes out, tears streaming down their cheeks.We all just started seventh grade, but I\u2019m going to the public middle school while my friends all transferred to the same private school. I can\u2019t articulate it then, but some part of me knows that  our sleepovers, our 3 a.m. prank calls, our Pillsbury-cinnamon-roll mornings are over. My friends have already started their ascent into a cooler, cliquier, wealthier world, one in which birthdays definitely don\u2019t involve parents. They\u2019ll have sex sooner, they\u2019ll drink and smoke weed, they\u2019ll stop inviting me to their birthdays. Meanwhile I\u2019ll muddle through the chaos of public school by studying harder, doing more, and never getting into trouble. In six years, they\u2019ll go to Ivy League colleges, and I will not.I stuff myself with pizza and try to laugh along.Sergio's in Hamden, CT.\nPhoto by Manny Vargas2003My dad cannot understand why I want to go to Sergio\u2019s. He\u2019s taken the train up from New York City, where the Italian food rivals the old country herself, and I\u2019m going to subject him to a suburban Connecticut red sauce joint? It\u2019s as insulting as when I visit him in the city wearing my high school varsity jacket, the name of my hometown emblazoned across the back. \u201cPeople will think you\u2019re a tourist,\u201d he says, but what he really means is that people will think he\u2019s a tourist, and he can\u2019t stomach that.Even the early-bird retirees aren\u2019t ready for dinner, but my dad has a train to catch, so here we are in the late sunlight with a half plain and half pepperoni pizza between us and a birch beer for me in that reddish pebbly cup. While we eat, my dad tells me about his most recent harassments: the person bagging his groceries a few weeks ago had read his unpublished manuscript and wouldn\u2019t stop staring at him. His landlord was trying to get him evicted, paid off by someone who was out to ruin his literary career. A waiter at the diner had ignored my dad persistently as a way of signaling that he, too, knew who my dad was. That\u2019s one good thing about this godforsaken suburb, he tells me. He doesn\u2019t get bothered here.Now that I\u2019m 16, I\u2019m old enough to know that my dad\u2019s stories are just that: the threads of his rapidly unspooling mind. But I won\u2019t understand until much later how his delusions affected me, how his unstable world perhaps permanently destabilized mine. And even now, after years and years, I won\u2019t have figured out how to protect myself except with the blunt objects of distance and time.2009My parents don\u2019t like my boyfriend, but they won\u2019t admit it until two years later, when I finally break up with him and move to a different state. For now, though, at this first dinner, they sit across from us, glassy-eyed and half-smiling, while my boyfriend talks at length about mounting an experimental puppet show at an art space in Williamsburg and I nervously tear my straw wrapper (ice water; I\u2019ve sworn off soda) into a dozen tiny pieces. Our table is too small for all our food: our salad bar salads, pasta primavera for my boyfriend who is vegan, eggplant parm for me, and a small pizza (half plain, half sausage and peppers) for my mom and stepdad to share.I realize in this moment that all the things I love about my boyfriend are the things my parents will hate: He\u2019s 31 to my 22, he\u2019s an actor/writer/poet/director who waits tables, he went to a new-agey college where he majored in something like transhumanist poetry, he is constantly touching me, and he makes very intense eye contact all the time. But because he\u2019s the first person I\u2019ve brought home since high school, and because they are polite to a fault, my parents let me figure out our gross incompatibility gradually and painfully and all on my own.I desperately want some of their pizza, but I\u2019ve committed to being gluten-free or at least avoiding bread in lieu of heavily breaded eggplant, which I\u2019ve decided doesn\u2019t count. And this pretty much sums up my life from 22 to 24: a series of stubborn and unjustified choices that try to give order to chaos but which actually makes no sense.Takeout orders at Sergio's are picked up from the deli counter in the back, where you can grab a slice of cheesecake or a few pieces of biscotti for dessert.\nPhoto by Manny Vargas2018I couldn\u2019t tell you who Sergio was, whether he even existed, or any of the other employees\u2019 names. The truth is that we rarely ate there, but it was our Friday night take-out spot. We\u2019d call and the same woman would answer, and we\u2019d ask for a large pie\u2014half cheese, half sausage and peppers\u2014and a large salad, and no matter who was on the line, she\u2019d know which family it was for. My stepdad would pick up our order on his way home from work after getting me from dance class or a yearbook meeting or whatever extracurricular I was into at the time. I\u2019d hold the hot cardboard box on my lap while he drove as the smell of sweet tomato sauce and salty, fatty sausage and pooling, melty mozzarella filled the car.People in this town say you aren\u2019t a local unless your grandparents were locals. My parents lived there for 27 years and never quite felt like they belonged. So when they decided to sell their house and move to a different town last fall, I was happy for them. I also knew that Sergio\u2019s was the one place I wanted to order from before they left.In the decade since I\u2019d sat there with my insufferable boyfriend, I moved away from and back to New York, disavowed the gluten-free thing, introduced my parents to two more boyfriends, and become a little like my father: snobby about pizza and most other parts of my city life. The pie from Sergio\u2019s that we ordered that night was the same as always: sauce a little too sweet, crust with a mild amount of char, and what some might call too much cheese. It was a flawed pizza, but it was the one I knew best.Amanda Shapiro is the editor of Healthyish.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsRed SauceConnecticutItalian AmericanRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
