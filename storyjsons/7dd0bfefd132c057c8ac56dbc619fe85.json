Be sure to seek out dry white vermouth, such as Dolin Dry Vermouth de Chamb\u00e9ry, which is pale and aromatic, rather than sweeter blanc, or bianco, vermouth.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Think this would be a great holiday aperitif - festive enough for guests, and with just enough alcohol to keep the cook in good spirits without being nap-inducing. I didn\u2019t have Creme de Cassis, so used Chambord instead, and thought the dry vermouth and lemon juice balanced the sweetness perfectly.   Nice drink!SpatulaCity123Los Angeles3/25/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titDrinksCocktailDrinks AllCr\u00e8me De CassisAlcohol & Other DrinksVermouthRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
