Plus more reviews!By Alex BeggsJanuary 29, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailWell, slather me in cookie butter and roll me in Everything But the Bagel Sesame Seasoning Blend, because 2021 is HERE and so is a ton of new stuff at Trader Joe\u2019s. Including the hottest, spiciest product it\u2019s ever sold. Intrigued yet? I have heartburn! It\u2019s crazy how the years keep coming, presidents change, pandemics rage, and Trader Joe\u2019s manages to find a new way to season nuts. Let\u2019s embark on this journey together, forever.Is That a Crunchwrap?Hatch Chile Chicken WrapsPop one of these hexagons into the oven and your lunch can be a crispy, somewhat dry flour tortilla containing a few tender bites of almost spicy chicken, black beans, and goo sauce. On a walk after this lunch, my partner proclaimed, \u201cMy burps taste like gas station.\u201d Which is high praise, depending on what circles you run in. (Never-ending circles.)On TrendUncured Turkey Bacon & Cheese Sous Vide Egg BitesJiggly smooth! Radiate these for a few seconds in your magic box, douse in hot sauce, and squish between an English muffin for optimal results. Alternately, stuff your bra with each bite, then enjoy as a snack later in the afternoon during another boring Zoom.Things That Inch You Closer to TacosHot Hot Crispy Habanero PeppersWOWPeople love chile crisp, so why not crisp chiles? These are crispy, wispy shreds of fried habanero slices. They are the texture of fried butterfly wings. If you eat one straight, you will feel things ignite behind your eyeballs. They are truly hot. Like right on the tongue, HOT. There\u2019s no slow build here, no nuance of flavors and spices. It\u2019s a little shred of hell. And I love it here. On Instagram, a friend we\u2019ll call \u201cCousin Tony\u201d conjectured that this is the spiciest product Joe has ever sold, and I agree. Previous hot sauces and ghost pepper this-and-that did not come close. Try it yourself!Organic Yellow Taco ShellsBeen AWHILE. Been awhile. These oily shells must be revived in the oven, otherwise, you\u2019ll have chewy, stale folded-over tortilla chips on your hands, which are also covered in oil. They\u2019re so oily! But\u2014thoughtful pause\u2014at least they\u2019re organic.Nut StuffEverything But the Bagel Nut DuoI\u2019m getting tired of this anti-bagel agenda. And these nuts\u2014rancid from sunflower oil past its prime, dry and dusty, lacking the dried garlic integral to the spice mix\u2014sealed the deal. I want everything AND THE BAGEL, Joe. Enough is enough.Guara AlmondsTIL Guara almonds are slightly larger than Marcona almonds. They remind me of the \u201cslightly irregular\u201d socks at T.J. Maxx, my second favorite TJ. They\u2019re fancy, but off-brand fancy. And that\u2019s good enough for me, baby. These Guara almonds are buttery and don\u2019t leave a bitter aftertaste, but they DO leave your fingers glittery with salt. Lick each finger and let the salt commingle with the Purell. There\u2019s nothing quite like it.Grainless GranolaWhat is granola without oats? Sticky seeds all stuck together. Fantastic! One huge clump will satisfy your midafternoon cravings for something, anything, whatever\u2019s closest. It did mine!Someone\u2019s Obsessed With Cacio e PepeSpaghetti Cacio e PepeIt instantaneously congealed on my plate into a mound of gummy worms bound by cacio-e-glue. Baaad.Cacio e Pepe (AGAIN?!) RavioliRubbery ravioli stuffed with ricotta, parm, and pep. Much better than the frozen spaghetti.From the Airline CollectionFrench Onion Macaroni & CheeseIf you miss traveling during this endless pandemic, heat some frozen macaroni and cheese in your oven, eat it directly from the sad little tray, and pretend you\u2019re on a plane. A special edition from Trader Joe\u2019s airline food collection, this slightly oniony baked pasta mush will make you feel full when you\u2019re hungry.Spices, I Mean, \u201cSeasoning Blends\u201dCuban Style Citrusy Garlic Seasoning BlendInspired by Cuban mojo sauce, which is wet, this is a combination of once-wet things that are now dry. Hmm. I want to bathe in tangy-garlicky-sweet-citrus mojo sauce. Not sure what I\u2019m going to do with this mojo exfoliant. The dehydrated lime zest and lime oil come on STRONG and puckery, and then the garlic and onion make themselves known, while the dried herbs cheer from the stands. Sprinkle it on things you will cook over fire, report back on how it went!Za\u2019atar Seasoning BlendThere\u2019s chickpea flour in this za\u2019atar that seems to serve as filler, making it a little dustier than the Israeli-style blend I get from the Spice House. The lemon oil, another random addition, is overpowering. There are better za\u2019atars out there, or you could DIY, but I appreciate Trader Joe\u2019s for helping people get one step closer to za\u2019atar fish and chips.Sugary ThingsChewy Chocolate and Peanut Butter Protein BarsThe puffed rice is rice-krispie-crunchie. The protein powder doesn\u2019t give me dry mouth or much definition in my abs. And the chocolate is well distributed. Like wearing bike shorts with no intention to bike, I enjoy the delusions of fitness this cookie bar offers. Yum!Partake Crunchy Sprinkle CookiesNotes of nothing, and, oh, a sprinkle, and then more nothing. Interesting aftertaste of something.12 Classic Lemon BarsThe number 12 here makes it seem like you\u2019re getting 12 lemon bars. But each lemon \u201cbar\u201d is a perfect square inch. Four of these squares make up one \u201cbar,\u201d according to my formula chart from the SAT. And while I did terribly on the math portion of the test, I still made good money tutoring kids in algebra once I got to college ($10 an hour). The crust is a little too dry, but the curd is nicely tart.Oil-BasedAvocado Oil SpraySpritzy!Extra Virgin Spanish Olive OilOnce upon a time, Andy Baraghani told me that you should taste olive oil, and if tasting it plain is delicious, it\u2019s good olive oil. Okay, Andy! This cloudy Spanish olive oil tastes like peppery olives that may have been sitting out in the olive bar for a few weeks.Suzie\u2019s Real Organic MayoSuzie loves the truth. Suzie lives in a reality that is real. Whatever she sees before her is as it is. Plain and simple. Not the nuanced reality the rest of us wallow in, our opinions distorted by a few long captions on Instagram and one memorable episode of Bar Rescue. Suzie, though, is free of this nonsense. She is real mayo. With soybean oil, eggs, egg yolks, lemon juice (from concentrate), and white vinegar. The same ingredients in my beloved Hellmann\u2019s, and yet the flavor is sweeter, tangier, and less eggy. So if this is \u201creal\u201d and Hellmann\u2019s is also \u201creal,\u201d which one is realest? They\u2019re living in two separate realities of their own making. And that is a SHAM. I don\u2019t like it one bit. But I\u2019ll choose mine.FishesSesame Crusted Hardwood Smoked Ahi TunaA tasty treat!Oak Smoked Scottish SalmonFantastic!Canned ThingsGreek Chickpeas With Parsley & CuminCumin-forward.Fire Roasted TomatoesWatery, with occasional flecks of burnt tomato skin.New SalamiCalabrese SalamiWhiffs of barnyard.
