I didn\u2019t understand why she was lying to me. It was blood\u2014so what? I never had a problem with this fact, but it seemed like everyone else thought I should.Growing up in Toronto, I often heard Filipino immigrants winkingly refer to dinuguan like my tita did, with coy nicknames. They wouldn\u2019t let their white friends taste without a warning. But I\u2019d spotted these same people at community gatherings, eagerly devouring bowls of their beloved black stew. In Manila, blood-based dishes need no equivocation: On visits with family, I saw butchers handing out blood-filled plastic bags with orders of lech\u00f3n, or street food vendors grilling betamax\u2014skewered blocks of coagulated blood\u2014over sizzling coals. And dinuguan was ubiquitous, on menus everywhere from the historic Aristocrat restaurant to local karinderias, served piping hot for merienda.Europeans champion their own blood-based delicacies. Across the Atlantic, blood pudding is the black gem in a full English breakfast. Butchers in France hawk boudin noir, Swedes serve bl\u00f6dplattar pancakes with lingonberry jam, and Germany counts blutwurst and \u201cblack and sour\u201d schwarzsauer as traditional fare. Even at steakhouses throughout America, diners request their steaks bloody. These dishes are named with unceremonious bluntness. They are what they say they are, and that\u2019s enough. Why couldn\u2019t Filipinos do the same?I wanted to know about the history of Philippine blood-eating, so I did a little digging. Though I encountered plenty of research pointing to Spain\u2019s influence on Philippine cuisine, I struggled to find historical texts that documented the genesis of our blood-based dishes. Several Filipinx recipe and culture blogs referenced a theory: that Spanish colonizers first introduced foods like morcilla sausage after invading the archipelago in the 16th century. Indigenous peoples perhaps then adapted these flavors into dishes that were uniquely theirs. Tangy blood stews known as fritada in Mexico and Guam\u2014other stops on the Galleon trade route\u2014support this cross-cultural origin story. But like others have suggested, I think it\u2019s just as likely that precolonial Philippine cooks had already invented dinuguan to make the most of the jungle\u2019s ample herds of wild pigs.I found it unsettling that our written record and oral history didn\u2019t seem to match up. To get a different take, I reached out to my uncle Claude Tayag, a chef and culinary writer based in our family\u2019s home province of Pampanga. He believes dinuguan likely emerged out of necessity. \u201cUsing every part of the animal is an age-old tradition in Filipino cuisine,\u201d he told me. \u201cAs a country develops, the upper class of society chooses the lean meat, the clean fillets, and discards the rest.\u201dImpoverished Filipinos, oppressed by Spanish colonial rule for more than 300 years, couldn\u2019t afford the most desirable cuts of meat. Loathe to waste, they made the most of the in-between. Early cooks took the humble offcuts and created dishes resplendent with fierce green chiles, earthy peppercorns, and bouquets of native garlic, transforming undesirable ingredients into the well-loved Filipino food we know today: lungs and hearts for spicy bopis, tripe and sticky oxtails for kare-kare, the fatty head for sizzling sisig, and blood for dinuguan. My uncle serves a regional version of the latter called tinadtad, teeming with chunks of coagulated blood, pork belly, trotters, and intestines in a mouth-puckering kamias broth. Anyone who tosses the innards, he said, is \u201cthrowing away the best parts.\u201dAfter our phone call, I felt like a pressure cooker about to blow. A confusing swirl of pride, sorrow, and rage swelled in my chest, and I burst into tears. Centuries of colonization and white supremacy in the Philippines had warped how we see our food\u2014and ourselves. This extends beyond Spanish rule: When the United States annexed the archipelago in 1898, it foisted American culture upon its inhabitants too. Many would argue this influence continues to dominate today, on the islands and in the diaspora.Whenever my relatives see me feast on dinuguan, they whisper incredulously: \u201cWow, her taste is so Filipino.\u201d I hope that someday this will no longer surprise them; that they\u2019ll take it for granted that I adore the foods our ancestors wrought.I imagined the aching homesickness that countless immigrant Filipinos experience when they land in a foreign country, and their desire to fit in\u2014if they could just be a little more white. Perhaps they felt that jokes like \u201cchocolate meat,\u201d which made light of the differences that made them unique, would ease their entry into a new society. Internalized oppression, the unfounded belief in the superiority of our white colonizers, fueled by centuries of subjugation, has caused so many of us to lose sight of what dinuguan really is: a celebration of Philippine creativity, resourcefulness, and defiance.When it comes down to it, blood is just a weak yellow broth crammed with cells and flecked red with iron. Humans have evolved to feel shock at the sight of blood because it pours out of us when we\u2019re hurt. But lingering disgust about eating it? I think that\u2019s learned.When I was a kid, my dad cooked dinuguan in the dead of Toronto winters, electrifying our home with its barnyard pungency. I watched as bright scarlet mellowed to deep brown; as blood turned into food. The steaming broth was the color of the earth after a typhoon or the wet hide of an ancient tree. I\u2019ve since devoured many variations, some made with wiggly gelatinous pork, others with funky fish sauce or chewy intestinal frills. Whenever my relatives see me feast on dinuguan, they whisper incredulously: \u201cWow, her taste is so Filipino.\u201d I hope that someday this will no longer surprise them; that they\u2019ll take it for granted that I adore the foods our ancestors wrought.My dad served dinuguan with pride, so I never felt the need to call it by any other name. Sometimes I make it for myself, the way he taught me. Or I turn to Nora Daza\u2019s Let\u2019s Cook With Nora, arguably the first great Filipino cookbook. Her recipe is straightforward: \u201cCut beef blood into small pieces. Pour in pork and beef blood, stirring continuously until thick.\u201d Toss in some chopped pig head and a diced pig heart, and dinner is served.In New York, where I live now, I may not see bags of pig blood handed out at the butcher, but Filipino cuisine is finally proliferating\u2014which delights my family to no end. At a recent sold-out outdoor event in the Lower East Side, hosted by the Filipino street food pop-up So Sarap, chefs scooped traditional Philippine braised meat dishes onto soft tortillas, a nod to Mexican cuisine. Behind wide steel pans heaped with fragrant longganisa, tocino, and tapa, an immense cauldron bubbled over a gas flame. When I peered inside, I saw tender strips of pork, lacy intestines, and snappy slivers of pig ear bathed in a deep mahogany sauce. I didn\u2019t need to see the menu, hanging on a sign overhead, to know what it was. But when I looked up, I was exhilarated to see the name dinuguan, on display for all the world to see.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCultureRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
