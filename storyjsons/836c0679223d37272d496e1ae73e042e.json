Available for local pickup, the box includes a rotating selection of iftar dishes, including the sandwich Farhan invented when he was reheating food his parents dropped off in his college dorm and the Medjool dates the Momins traditionally use to break fast each evening.The Dates\u201cDates signify a blessing from God,\u201d Ahmed says. \u201cBreaking your fast with one gives you energy for the evening prayers and subsequent feast,\u201d Farhan adds. This box comes with Medjool dates\u2014which Farhan loves for their rich taste and high sugar and vitamin content\u2014plus seasonal fruit.The Nimbu PaniWhenever Farhan tells people he\u2019s fasting during the Muslim holy month, he gets the same follow-up question: \u201cNot even water?\u201d Drinking anything is prohibited until iftar, so the Momins wanted to offer something that is easy on the stomach after a day without food or beverages. Enter their nimbu pain (top left corner), a lemonade spiced with black salt and cumin.The SamosaSamosas are a must at iftar parties Farhan has attended. One big samosa, filled with potatoes and peas and served with cilantro and tamarind chutneys, is nestled in the box.The Nihari SandwichOne time in college, Farhan left some nihari\u2014a slow-cooked meat dish\u2014on the stove for too long, and it shredded apart. So he took some bread \u201cand treated it like a sloppy Joe,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was delicious.\u201d Now on the menu at Atlanta Halal Meat & Food, it\u2019s become a best-seller. So naturally it\u2019s part of the iftar box.The Kheer\u201cKheer is just quintessential to Ramadan for us,\u201d Farhan shares. This cardamom-y rice pudding (top right) is served for dessert at least a few times during Ramadan in the Momins\u2019 household. \u201cAfter fasting you want something a little sweeter, and kheer is very good because it is filling and cooling,\u201d Ahmed explains.The FaloodaTake a scoop of kulfi; add rose syrup, milk, agar-agar jellies, vermicelli, and basil seeds; and you get this falooda (bottom right corner). \u201cIt\u2019s a delicious, high-calorie way to cap off your fast,\u201d Farhan says of the dessert.Explore Bon App\u00e9titDish DecodedRamadanRestaurantsAtlantaRead MorerestaurantsEverything About Brandoni Pepperoni\u2019s Pizzas Scream Los AngelesBy Elyse InaminerestaurantsThe Long and Winding Road to Richmond's Most Ambitious New Restaurant\u2014in One DishBy Elyse InaminerestaurantsEverything That Goes Into a Hot, Luscious Bowl of Mohinga at Brooklyn\u2019s RangoonBy Hilary CadiganrestaurantsAt Charleston\u2019s Jackrabbit Filly, Here's How to Eat Your Weight in LuckBy Jenny LiaoRecipes you want to make.
