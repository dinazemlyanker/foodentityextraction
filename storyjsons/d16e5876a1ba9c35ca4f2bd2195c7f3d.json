I\u2019ve never been either fully French or fully American; I\u2019ve always landed somewhere in between. My sister and I would spend summers on the southwestern coast of France with my mom\u2019s family, and the rest of the year we\u2019d be in New England suburbs with my French mom and second-generation Italian dad.  Along with the language gap I quickly discovered another divide, in food culture.In the US, food was either good or bad. Good foods were generally considered to be low in fat and taste, whereas bad foods were the kind my family regularly ate: cheese, bread, starches, nightshades, eggs. We\u2019d eat vegetables of course, and our food rarely came from boxes or bags. In America, I\u2019d been taught to count my calories and reduce my fat intake at the expense of joy. Staying \u201chealthy,\u201d or, \u201con trend,\u201d was considered prudent both at school and on my block.In France no one gasped if you ate bread and butter for breakfast and then had some cheese for lunch. No one told you fruit has too much sugar, or that mushrooms are high in carbs. If the conversation around losing weight ever came up it was simple \u2014 eat less. No fads, no powdered or canned smoothies, no get-skinny-quick tricks. Food was blessedly uncomplicated.As a kid trying to fit in, I learned to accept \u201chealthy\u201d food at my American friends\u2019 houses with a smile; covertly tossing things I hated, like my mortal enemy, Go-Gurt. At lunchtime, I\u2019d whip out Roquefort and butter tartines, alienating entire lunchrooms and prompting nuns to offer me healthier options, like low-fat tomato soup. Fresh from a trip to France, I was once asked by a friend\u2019s mom asked what I wanted to eat. I joyfully shouted my latest discovery; jambon beurre\u2014a heavenly mixture of cultured butter, baguette, and thinly sliced Jambon (ham) de Paris. Her response? \u201cI can\u2019t believe your mom would let you eat that, it\u2019s so unhealthy.\u201dClaims that my family was unhealthy or destined for cardiac arrest felt like an attack on my mom, me, and a culture I\u2019d grown to love. My mom worked a full-time job, one of the ways I\u2019d get to spend time with her was in the kitchen. To me, she was a magician. She\u2019d take the most ordinary ingredients and transform them into the best things I\u2019d ever eaten. Take flour and butter. You want pastry? Add water. Want a thicker sauce? Cook it and make a roux. Want a sauce that will change your life? Add milk to that roux.In the \u201880s, the USDA released the first of many \u201cdietary guidelines for Americans\u201d firing the first shot on the war on fat. For decades, the USDA kept up the mantra of choosing \u201ca diet low in fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol.\u201d While the intention of the USDA was probably not to hockey stick my intake of Chips Ahoy! 100-calorie packs, that was the result. Fast forward a few decades and the USDA has since reversed many of its recommendations. In their latest handbook, they stepped back from one of their most vehement recommendations\u2014strict limits on dietary cholesterol. Cholesterol, the demon behind all the \u201cbad foods\u201d of my American childhood\u2014cheese, butter, full-fat products\u2014is now no longer a \u201cnutrient of concern.\u201d Neither is coffee (3-5 cups a day), eggs (no limits), or skipping breakfast.As I entered my later teenage years, education around \u201chealth\u201d became synonymous with staying thin, which, as we know, isn\u2019t an indicator of health. My \u201cindulgent\u201d eating was the source of constant commentary from peers and strangers. I\u2019d whip out a pizza my dad made the night before at my lifeguarding gig and be informed that I wouldn\u2019t maintain my \u201cfigure\u201d with that kind of eating. Relative strangers would whisper warnings to \u201cbe careful\u201d with my butter to bread ratio, better yet, just skip it. The only thing that dodged condemnation would be steamed vegetables, a protein bar, or, a 100-calorie snack bag.To me, that logic has always been flawed. To resent food is to deny one of life\u2019s most basic privileges and pleasures. Personally, obsessing over food and its calories doesn\u2019t feed anything other than my anxiety. Like the tiny sunglasses trend, I\u2019m dubious of anything deemed \u201cin or out,\u201d particularly when it has direct implications for my health. One thing I\u2019ve learned is that eating isn\u2019t about being good or bad, it\u2019s about eating, preferably with a group of close friends. I\u2019ve been lucky to eat well and learned how to cook from a young age. I\u2019m not a doctor, but I recommend everyone enjoy the meals they have left, and, pending any allergies, preferably with a side of baguette, cultured butter, and a healthy slice of Roquefort on top.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishFranceTrendsRead MoreLifestyleWhole Wheat Is No Healthier than White Bread, Food Scientists ClaimBy Ali RosenRecipes you want to make.
