He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.There are two things on repeat this week in the RapoBuck household: One is the Billy Ray Cyrus remix of \u201cOld Town Road\u201d (thanks to our 11-year-old son), and the other is ramps.I can\u2019t quit either.With ramps, though, I at least can offer a bit of insight and advice. To start, if you see some, buy some. They\u2019re hard to miss. With their floppy green leaves and white-to-purple stems, they pile up at farmers\u2019 markets and better grocers this time of year. And, as you know, food-media types like me can\u2019t help but go on and on about them.Photo by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiIntoxicatingly fragrant, they\u2019re technically wild leeks. But I like to think of them as the working man\u2019s white truffle. They\u2019re much more accessible and affordable, but like truffles, the less you do with them, the better.Want this letter before it hits the website?

You basically just saut\u00e9 the bulbs and then the leaves in a combo of butter and olive oil; hit them with a splash of starchy, salty pasta water to create a saucy emulsion; and then finish the mixture with a blizzard of finely grated parm.And, if you\u2019re smart like Alison Roman, you top off your limited-engagement springtime pasta with a shaving of lemon zest, to help cut through all that butter and cheese. I regretfully neglected this crowning step Saturday night, but I did top the pasta with a flourish of crunchy homemade breadcrumbs, because carbs plus carbs always equals awesome.Danny KimYou can do all sorts of other things with ramps\u2014like pickle them and deep fry them and pesto them and pair them with softly scrambled eggs, which I\u2019ll probably do because I love scrambled eggs. But mostly, like singing loudly along to \u201cOld Town Road\u201d over and over and over again, I\u2019ll just make a lot of ramp pasta. The latter of which, at least, I know won\u2019t make my 11-year-old cringe.Get the recipe:Spaghetti with RampsView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterRampRead MorecookingThis Perfect Baked Potato Was the Best Part of DinnerBy Adam RapoportcookingI Learned Some Lessons Spatchcocking a ChickenBy Adam RapoportRecipes you want to make.
