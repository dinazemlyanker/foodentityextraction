Frittata, quiche, tortilla espa\u00f1ola: I could live without them. They\u2019re just not my thing. Eggy cakes. They\u2019re bland, somehow never salted enough. They\u2019re damp, an adjective that doesn\u2019t have any positive connotations (see: every creepy basement description, gym shorts). They\u2019re spongy, the wet blanket of food textures. I don\u2019t hate these eggy cakes. If you gave me $100 (or even $10), I\u2019d eat one! I just prefer not to.But a few months ago, when I was at C\u00farate in Asheville, I had to. My two dining companions added a plain-sounding tortilla espa\u00f1ola to our already very long order, and I couldn\u2019t say no. I was about to tell my friends to go ahead and just split it between them when the hockey-puck-shaped dish hit our table. But then one of them cut into it, and a river of gold flowed out from the center. \u201cAN EGG YOLK?!\u201d we all squealed. I couldn\u2019t\u2014and didn\u2019t\u2014let my friends split it.The tortilla was unlike any other I\u2019d ever had, and debunked every thing I disliked about dishes like this. It was flavorful, with a good amount of salt, sweetness, and slight smoke. It was perfectly browned and crisp on the outside, and gooey on the inside\u2014like a savory molten lava cake, with  a rich and creamy and yolky center. There was nothing damp, spongy, or moist about it.Katie Button, the chef and owner of C\u00farate, also felt lukewarm about tortilla espa\u00f1ola when she lived in Spain as a stagiare at El Bulli. So she culled techniques from family and friends to perfect the dish for her restaurant before she opened it eight years ago. That includes adding homemade potato chips to the mix for a firm, almost crisp consistency\u2014a tip from her friend (and chef of Somni in L.A.) Aitor Zabala\u2014and letting the ingredients sit together overnight, so the potatoes and onions can absorb the egg for a less liquidy, more chunky result. Each tortilla is cooked to order in one of those gimmicky one-egg frying pans (\u201cThe key to everything!\u201d Button says). It's about three minutes on each side until the center feels slightly squishy\u2014like rare steak, just as her Spanish mother-in-law taught her.The result is a tortilla espa\u00f1ola that's made this lukewarm editor into a tortilla espa\u00f1ola fanatic. Guess that's my new take.Go there: C\u00farateExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsSpanishAsheville, NCRead MorerestaurantsI Didn\u2019t Know Collard Greens Could Taste Like This Until I Went to Buxton HallBy Emily SchultzRecipes you want to make.
