A mother sauce is one of the building blocks of classic French cuisine\u2014a sauce used to make other sauces. There are five mother sauces, and of those five b\u00e9chamel might be our favorite.In its purest form, b\u00e9chamel is comprised of butter and flour that have been cooked together (a mixture that's also known as a roux) and milk, with just a bit of seasoning. The result is a silky cream sauce that can be used either on its own or as the base for countless other sauces.B\u00e9chamel is thick, clinging to food in the way that a good sauce should\u2014and it\u2019s that roux we have to thank for that. The first step in making a b\u00e9chamel is to create a roux, a mixture of flour and fat that acts as a thickening agent. (If you've made gravy on Thanksgiving, you've probably made a roux before.) To make a roux for b\u00e9chamel, you simply heat the fat\u2014in this case butter\u2014and whisk in roughly equal parts flour, cooking it just long enough to get some of the raw flavor out of the flour but not so long that it takes on any color. (In some other instances\u2014gumbo being one of them\u2014a roux will be cooked for an extended period of time, until it takes on a deep, dark color and nutty flavor, but that's not what we want here.)Once the roux is properly cooked, the next step is to whisk in milk. (You may have noticed at this point that this sauce is pretty much just fat, flour, and more fat\u2014that\u2019s why it's so good, folks.) Milk is what turns the roux into a sauce. But you can\u2019t just dump it all in at once. To create a smooth consistency (a necessity when it comes to b\u00e9chamel), you need to gradually whisk in the milk. If you pour it all in at once, it will get clumpy and awkward. No one wants an awkward sauce. But we do want a flavorful sauce, so we need to continue to cook the b\u00e9chamel, whisking it frequently, until it thickens to the degree that we want it to. Different recipes will call for different amounts of milk and different coking times, which will produce different consistencies. For example, when making a croque monsieur, you want the sauce to be thick and almost spreadable, but for lasagna you want it to be thinner and almost pourable.Once you've reached the degree of thickness you're after, it's time to season the b\u00e9chamel with salt and nutmeg. Yeah: nutmeg! It\u2019s not a flavor you should necessarily be able to pick out if you didn\u2019t already know it was there, but nutmeg lends this otherwise kind of one-note sauce a considerable amount of warmth, spice, and complexity. It\u2019s like putting a coat on over your favorite sweater. The whole situation gets cozier.Mac and cheese sits comfortably in the B\u00e9chamel Hall of Fame\nAnd that's it! Now all you have to do is use the b\u00e9chamel. How? Well, there are plenty of ways. You could swipe it all over the bread you\u2019re using to make croque monsieurs. You could use it as the creamy component for a classic lasagna. You can use it as a base for your cheddar-loaded mac and cheese. You could use it as the French do and make some fancy sauces like mornay or nantuan or soubise.But really, all you need to know is that you have a versatile, creamy white sauce that can act as vehicle for whatever flavor you want to deliver. You can load it with herbs or cheese or lemon zest or chile powder. You can take it in any direction you\u2019d like. That\u2019s the beauty of b\u00e9chamel.Now, about those croque monsieurs:Basically Croque MonsieurLike a hot ham and cheese sandwich, but slathered with cream sauce and baked to bubbly perfection. (Yeah, it's as good as it sounds.)View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyBechamelSauceRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
