Next up is Martha Stoumen, first generation natural winemaker, responsible farmer, and recovering perfectionist.Martha Stoumen was trying to figure out what she wanted to be when she grew up. Armed with a freshly minted UCLA geography degree and a deep curiosity about her Italian lineage, Stoumen headed to Tenuta di Spannocchia, an organic farm and learning center in Tuscany. She was put to work in the vineyard and olive orchard: pruning vines, harvesting grapes and olives, tasting fruit for ripeness, and navigating the small cellar. \u201cI felt like I was playing,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I got back to California and I was trying to face \u2018real\u2019 life, I decided to try to make my work what I feel like play is. I haven\u2019t stopped since.\u201dStoumen, then twenty-two, set out for eight years of apprenticeships with winemakers around the world, even picking up a masters in Enology and Viticulture from UC Davis along the way. Her time abroad culminated with Giusto Occhipinti at COS in Sicily\u2014 a trailblazing natural winery founded in 1980 that was amongst the first to celebrate the region\u2019s indigenous grape varieties rather than follow the norm of producing bulk wines with international grape varieties to be sold-off for blends.\u201cWine is such an expression of a place\u2014it\u2019s also a self expression\u2014but it\u2019s a love letter to a place,\u201d she says.\u201dCalifornia wines were being overworked to the point that they ceased to tell us anything about their regions. I kept thinking about what California is, what would I like it to be in terms of winemaking, and that\u2019s when I realized I needed to come home.\u201dIn 2014, Martha Stoumen Wines was born with the ambition of making distinctly Californian wines. Stoumen toiled away at her own projects during off-hours while working for Broc Cellars in Berkeley, making wine with a few friends in one of their parents\u2019 basements. The first release under her eponymous label dropped in 2017.Nowadays, running the Sebastopol winery is a full-time gig that includes leasing and farming half her own vineyards, collaborating on a p\u00e9t-nat with funny guy Eric Wareheim, and keeping up with orders for Post-Flirtation, her zippy, playful subset of wines that inevitably sells out. \u201cSeeing years of hope and hard work come to fruition is probably one of the most rewarding experiences in life,\u201c Stoumen says, \u201cAt the end of the day, I just want people to enjoy these wines and have some delicious pleasure in their lives.\u201dWe caught up with Stoumen about the power of wine to transcend generations, letting go of perfection, and how winemaking can be more sustainable.My winemaking philosophy is\u2026 nature provides the answers and you just have to be open enough to see them.The biggest challenge in winemaking is\u2026  keeping your cool. Nature provides the answers, but man, it can be real rough sometimes. When things don\u2019t go the way you expected, look at how they are going and think of the creative, wonderful outcome you can make of that.The biggest reward of winemaking is\u2026creativity and connection with other people.I believe wine has the power to\u2026connect humans in the present moment and transcend generations. I work with grapes that were planted by people who have now passed away and I\u2019ve tried wines that were made by people who have passed away: It is literally the translation of their handwork and you\u2019re ingesting it into your body and it becomes a part of your experience.Learning winemaking in Italy taught me\u2026 to trust in my ability as a human to taste and smell rather than overcomplicate things. When I\u2019m in Italy, I feel more like myself than I do in the states. There\u2019s so much freedom in the way you speak and the way you say things.If I could share my wine with anyone, it would be\u2026all of my ancestors, most of whom I don't know, at a huge feast. Who knows? My ancestors might be assholes, but I\u2019m truly curious about who they are, what their stories are and how they got to the U.S.I feel supported when\u2026 people show up and help. It\u2019s a huge love language of my family: my parents help me disgorge (Editor\u2019s note: when sediment is removed from a bottled sparkling wine after secondary fermentation) and my brothers come take down trees in the vineyard. They won\u2019t say much necessarily; they\u2019ll show their love through help instead.I\u2019m listening to... Lauryn Hill, Sly and the Family Stone, and early \u201990s Mariah Carey.Right now I\u2019m reading... Dune. I never thought I\u2019d be into sci-fi, but I felt like I needed a little adventure.The pleasure I have to fight for is\u2026letting go of this idea of perfection. Growing up, I was a severe perfectionist and have worked to undo that throughout my adulthood. I think making natural wine is a huge counterbalance for that; you get to be very creative without being controlling.I want us all to joyfully rally around changing our habits to better the environment rather than using guilt and fear as mechanisms for change. Herbicides and fumigants have taken a huge toll on soil bacteria and fungi, which has yielded less nutritious, flavorful food (and grapes) over time. Rather than stopping the conversation at \"herbicides are bad, fumigants are bad, our soils are dead, we should stop using these chemicals,\"we should look at how our soil systems work and feel empowered to compost more, help keep soils aerated, and let soils, bacteria, fungi, and plants do their choreographed dance with one another to make our food more delicious again.Whether or not Martha Stouman Wines lives beyond my lifetime, I would love the future to be one that pushes the boundaries of transparency in the wine industry through education and an open dialog around farming and wine. When I came back to California, I thought about what I really wanted to say. If that becomes irrelevant, then Martha Stoumen Wines will fade out naturally. If it stays relevant and connected, then it will live on as long as it needs to.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishPerson of Interestnatural wineInterviewsRead MoreLifestyleNew Orleans Chef Nina Compton Isn't Afraid of the Dish PitBy Kristin BraswellRecipes you want to make.
