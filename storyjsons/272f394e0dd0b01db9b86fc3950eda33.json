Although that is still the way most people first experience the plant, we\u2019re currently living in what I like to call the Cannabis Renaissance. Folks are creating all kinds of products that dial in to exactly what various consumers want, putting it in everything from gummies to dissolvable mint strips to cooking oils. Personally, I still enjoy rolled cannabis but love exploring all the new edible options too. Which brings me to my new obsession, Mondo cannabis powder.Mondo is marketed as an anti-anxiety supplement that you can take during work hours. Its website promises \u201canxiety relief without intoxication,\u201d and the small, attractive glass jar is shown resting on a laptop. The powder contains coconut oil, cacao butter, and three parts of the cannabis plant: THC (the compound in cannabis that has psychoactive properties and is still illegal in many states) as well as CBD and CBN (compounds that don't have psychoactive properties but are used to treat pain and stress). The folks at Mondo start by extracting the cannabis compounds by simmering the cannabis in coconut oil, which gives the product a warm, pleasant aroma and taste. How they make it into a dissolvable powder is a trade secret.What I\u2019m really obsessed with is how versatile of a product it is. I've tried plenty of cannabis edibles in my time, but I rarely cook with it myself. Because THC needs a fat source to be absorbed when eaten, you have to infuse the plant in butter or oil, which takes more time and energy than I'm willing to spend. Mondo does the work of infusing for you, so it's ready to mix into anything you can imagine. I can swirl it into salad dressings or into a smoothie without getting that gritty supplement taste or mouthfeel. It can dissolve right into a cup of coffee or tea, and it certainly wouldn\u2019t be bad sprinkled on your morning yogurt with fruit, if you\u2019re into that in the a.m. There are no added sugars, and the jar comes with a 5-milligram dose scoop to allow you to know how much you\u2019re consuming.Everyone responds differently to cannabis products, but, for me, one serving of Mondo is nothing like a typical high. It's great for creative energy: bright and peppy, with none of the dullness or crash that come with some strains of THC. Cannabis products have come a long way since my friend passed me my first joint many moons ago, and I\u2019m glad. It\u2019s been great for me to not have to smoke every time I\u2019ve wanted the benefits of weed. As the industry continues to grow, I\u2019m happy to see that companies like Mondo are giving consumers the ability to micro-dose cannabis in safe, fun\u2014and I\u2019d even say healthy\u2014ways.Buy Mondo at select dispensaries in California.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishMarijuanaCannabisShoppingRead MoreLifestyleHow to Entertain with Weed: An Etiquette GuideBy Mackenzie WagonerRecipes you want to make.
