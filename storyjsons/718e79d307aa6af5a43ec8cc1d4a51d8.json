But where did they come from?By Alex BeggsFebruary 13, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Hayden SpearsFacebookTwitterEmailLike you, the H-E-B flour tortilla has accepted the fact that it is imperfect. It\u2019s okay with that. That\u2019s part of the reason everyone loves it so much. Its little quirks. Like the lumpy, bumpy, not-quite-circular shape. Some air bubbles here and there. An edge that\u2019s folded over a bit, like a teenage ear awaiting a piercing. These are signs that the precious H-E-B tortilla is homemade. Or as close to homemade as you can get in a 68,000-square-foot grocery store along the Houston interstate.My half-Mexican, very Tex-Mex mom used to make flour tortillas with an electric press. She\u2019d roll balls of dough made with flour, salt, baking powder, warm water, and Crisco and let them proof into silky balloons under a towel. Then she\u2019d set up an assembly line where my siblings and I would stand to the side while she pressed out the tortilla and then passed it to us. Well, it would have been an assembly line if we\u2019d put them in the kitchen towel instead of eating them one by one. Sometimes we\u2019d slather them with butter and chew them in front of the TV, not knowing how this stupid greasy moment would be one of life\u2019s best.See what I mean about imperfection? Can relate.\nPhoto by Hayden SpearsWhen there wasn\u2019t time for that cute glowing family portrait type of cooking, we bought similarly chewy flour tortillas at H-E-B. Our local store had people pressing them out\u2014live! IRL!\u2014right there in the aisle, surrounded by display tables of tortillas. They\u2019d package the tortillas and stack them high in what Little Me thought was a tortilla fort. When you picked up a package, it would be warm and steamy. I\u2019d clutch it to my chest like a heating pad. H-E-B had it all figured out.In fact, they\u2019d figured it out decades before I even got there. Jorge Elizondo, H-E-B\u2019s VP of Customer Insights, grew up in South Texas with a tortilleria three blocks away. \u201cYou would go there to find your flour or corn tortillas and then you'd go to H-E-B to do your grocery shopping,\u201d he said. It was around 40 years ago that some savvy exec noticed the chance to fulfill two customer needs in one store. Now nearly every location\u2014350 throughout the state of Texas and nowhere else\u2014has an in-store tortilleria. (In 2006 H-E-B took it a step further by launching Mi Tienda, a Mexican grocery store with huge piles of dried chiles in the produce department and in-store taquerias. Catch me happily wandering the aisles with an XL foam cup of horchata whenever I\u2019m back in Houston.)Elizondo\u2019s parents are from Monterey, Mexico, where flour tortillas are a treat, corn tortillas the norm. He was eating an H-E-B tortilla with melted butter moments before I called him. \u201cThe first bite you take, you can smell the butter, you can taste the butter,\u201d he said. \u201cI was having it with a cup of coffee and the combination was reminiscent of many years ago with my parents.\u201d I told him he was killing me.The H-E-B tortilla operation is a well-buttered machine. Roll dough balls, press, count, package.\nPhoto by Hayden SpearsAt 4 a.m. every morning, the bakers at H-E-B\u2019s in-store tortillerias start pulling and pressing from a huge ball of dough delivered to the store from some place mysterious and, I assume, very sanitary. (Okay, it\u2019s a bakery plant in San Antonio.) For the regular flour tortillas, it\u2019s a mix of wheat flour, palm oil, salt, and leaveners. Depending on the store and its customer base, there might be three shifts of tortilla bakers to meet demand. Tortillas are pressed out by the thousands and packaged in bags of 10 or 20, separated with squares of tissue-like wax paper. If you ask a baker kindly for a sample, they\u2019ll hand one over and you\u2019ll say a quick prayer of thanks for your grocery store communion.Each store makes its tortillas a little differently. Some are thicker, thinner, smaller\u2014or more haphazard, with those folded-over-ear edges customers write cantankerous Facebook reviews about. People, do you want carbon copy factory tortillas that taste like preservatives and plastic wrap?! I do not!When You Need a Tortilla...means what you really need is a bag of 20.\nPhoto by Hayden SpearsAll are slightly underbaked and on the pale side because the idea is you will go home and reheat them in a hot cast-iron pan or directly over the stovetop flame. Reality is, you will snack on a few in the car home because Houston traffic is ridiculous and they\u2019re WARM (kept so in what looks like gas station ice cream coolers but are actually warm tortilla incubators). They\u2019re floury and chewy and bendy. The regular flour tortillas are the top seller. (They cost between $2\u2013$4.)  Whole wheat is the second most popular because people think they\u2019re healthier. The ones made with butter are No. 3, but those are the inarguable best. They taste of butter. It\u2019s one note, but the note is butter.After I moved to New York, I\u2019d visit my sister in Houston and we\u2019d hit up the H-E-B in Montrose so I could stock up on tortillas. I\u2019d ask for them for Christmas, so my dad would mail them to me along with Bob\u2019s Texas-style jalape\u00f1o kettle chips, paying more in express shipping than the cost of the contents within, unless you can put a price on nostalgia (it\u2019s $26.84).The H-E-B flour tortilla is more Texas style than traditionally Mexican, but the recipe has changed in small ways over the years to reflect customer tastes\u2014especially in areas of Texas with populations upward of 90 percent Mexican\u2014and feedback from employees, some of whom come from Mexican families that have made tortillas for generations. As Elizondo puts it: \u201cYou have to have a great tortilla or you\u2019re just not going to stay in business.\u201d That\u2019s why there are no longer artificial ingredients or preservatives in H-E-B\u2019s tortillas.The problem is, H-E-B doesn\u2019t sell any of its tortillas online. So the greatness, the mystique, the glory of the H-E-B flour tortilla has only grown in my memory the longer I\u2019ve been away from Texas, in the way nostalgia can delude us. (I used to think my mom\u2019s enchiladas were some gourmet shit\u2014they\u2019re just corn tortillas dipped in Old El Paso canned sauce.)H-E-B employees (called \u201cpartners\u201d) are encouraged to give the store feedback and suggestions, which is how the tortilla recipe has evolved over time.\nPhoto by Hayden SpearsAnd sure, there are hoity-toity flour tortillas out there, like Vista Hermosa\u2019s, which could probably take H-E-B\u2019s in a duel, if it came to that kind of carb-on-carb violence. But the H-E-B flour tortilla is still the best supermarket-brand tortilla out there, easy. My love for them has not faded.Recently a friend went to Houston and asked if he could bring anything back for me. \u201cH-E-B flour tortillas! This is not a drill!\u201d I replied. He brought back two bags of 20, but one was down to 16 because he couldn\u2019t resist snacking on a few on the plane. \u201cUghhhhh they\u2019re sooo goooood,\u201d he groaned in apology.
