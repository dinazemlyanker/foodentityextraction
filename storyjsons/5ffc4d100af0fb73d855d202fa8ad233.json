Wear One of These Pins to Prove ItMover & Shaker Co.\u2019s cool cocktail pins let me show my love for all the martinis, Manhattans, and Mai Tais that sustain me.By Christina ChaeyOctober 10, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie CraigFacebookTwitterEmailI first spotted one of Mover & Shaker Co.\u2019s enamel pins on cocktail man and Bitters author Brad Thomas Parsons\u2019 Instagram a few months ago. I didn\u2019t know before that moment that I needed a glossy little pin of Fernando, the green-and-citron mascot of the Italian amaro Fernet Branca. But the instant I saw that little gator guy proudly hoisting up a Branca-branded orange, I had to have him... and I don't even like Fernet.Then I discovered all of Mover & Shaker Co.\u2019s other nostalgic and cheeky pins. There\u2019s the Kool-Aid Man\u2013inspired \u201cNegroni Man\u201d who is ready to bust through walls upon command (OHHHH YEAHHHHHH). Bender from Futurama and Archer wear matching red caps that say \u201cStill Making Great Cocktails.\u201d Salt Bae, a.k.a. the Morton Salt Girl-gone-bad, wields a scythe and a canister of salt emblazoned with a skull and crossbones. These were clearly made by people who not only get my love of cocktails, but also share my appreciation for old-school cartoons and well-placed pop-culture references. So, naturally, I called them up to find out who they were.I reached Nick Hogan, a bartender and cofounder. Hogan and his longtime friend Matt Shail founded the brand in 2017 as a little side hustle. It meant Shail could flex his graphic design skills, and Hogan, who was trying to drum up more of a name for himself in the craft bartending scene, could seed a bit of buzz by bringing the pins around to his gigs at bars and events.They settled on two initial pin designs: One was a take on Angostura bitters, an iconic bar staple and one of the key ingredients in a classic Manhattan; the other paid homage to Fernet Branca, the robustly minty and bitter amaro that\u2019s often shared between bartenders and impassioned drinkers as a \u201csecret handshake\u201d drink of sorts.But it wasn\u2018t until a few months later that things really took off. When the second season of Stranger Things hit Netflix last fall, Hogan was inspired to create a pin that said \u201cStronger Drinks,\u201d in the style of the show\u2019s logo. Hogan and Shail got in touch with Pinlord, a popular Instagram account dedicated to enamel pins, who featured the design on its account. The pin went viral, and Mover & Shaker Co. sold their entire stock overnight.For now, the pair is still approaching Mover & Shaker from the perspective of two hobbyists who just want to make cool stuff for people who appreciate booze. Both have other full-time jobs, and their primary focus (for the time being) is to keep creating designs that excite them. They've expanded to 40-some different pin designs, and have begun selling patches and t-shirts too. They do special collaborations and custom pins here and there, but mostly they stick to what they know, like the recent Two-Can Sam, a whimsical spin on vintage Guinness beer posters that instead features a certain fruit-flavored breakfast cereal mascot. Or one of my personal favorites: the Flair Bears, a Care Bears-inspired pin that takes a subtle jab at the ridiculous theatrics of \u201cflair bartending\u201d\u2014the kind of performative cocktail-making that involves throwing liquor bottles high in the air, lighting things on fire, doing crazy-acrobatic pours, and so on.\u201cBartenders are always coming up with puns for flair bartending,\u201d Hogan says. \u201cIt's like the opposite of craft bartending.\u201d Other contenders? \u201cFlairy Potter,\u201d he says. \u201cOr maybe Flairy Bird.\u201d Consider this my vote in advance to Flairy Potter.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCocktailRead MorecookingBad Wine Is Just a Great Cocktail Waiting to HappenBy Alison RomancookingThis Frozen Margarita Pie Is Full of Tequila and Just As Incredible As It SoundsBy Jesse Sparksculture6 Essential Cocktails Everyone Should Know How to MakeBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
