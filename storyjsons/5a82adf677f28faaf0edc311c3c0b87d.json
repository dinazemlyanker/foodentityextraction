And you guys dig it. So Andy will be recapping some of your favorite segments here. Up next, Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence, the Japanese sunscreen that Baraghani swears by.Sunscreen was the first big step I took in preserving and sustaining the skin that I have, and that\u2019s really thanks to my mother. She was a Lancome lady for over 20 years in San Francisco, and wherever we went, she would always remind us to put on sunscreen. When I moved to New York and I was on my own, I still made sure to incorporate sunscreen into my daily skincare regimen. It doesn't matter if it's 95\u00b0F or 35\u00b0F, rainy and snowy or humid and hot\u2014I'm wearing it, and I'm reapplying all day, because sunlight is one of the worst things you can do to your skin along with sugar and lack of sleep.But I didn\u2019t find my holy-grail sunscreen until two years ago. I was on Reddit at /r/skincareaddiction, which is a great resource for anyone interested in skincare. There is a lot of information\u2014you might have to filter a bit to find what feels right for your skin\u2014and I noticed a lot of people talking about Bior\u00e9 UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence.This sunscreen has a serious cult following, though it\u2019s not technically sold in the United States. I honestly just got it because I wanted to try something new, but I quickly became obsessed because it has a great lightweight consistency in addition to serious protection. I always look for sunscreen that has UVA and UVB protection, and this product has both. It\u2019s also SPF 50+. I order it on Amazon, and it\u2019s so worth it.I know some people use moisturizers with SPF, but I\u2019m a firm believer in using two separate products. I prep my skin with Embryolisse Concentrated Lait Cream, let it set, and then put Bior\u00e9 UV Aqua Rich all over. I go heavy on my cheeks, forehead, and nose, then hit the forgotten places: ears, neck, throat, hands, and any exposed chest area. The lightweight consistency means it absorbs rapidly without leaving a white cast, which is never a good look.I\u2019m not a homebody, and it\u2019s summer\u2014of course I\u2019m out in the sun! So I take my vitamin D pills, I cross the street to stay in the shade, and I wear this sunscreen. Mom, I hope you're proud.Buy it: Bior\u00e9 UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence, $18.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
