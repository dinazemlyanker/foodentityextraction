But those people are wrong. It\u2019s not a \u201cgood party\u201d unless there\u2019s dip, preferably many different types (at least three). If the idea of preparing more than one dip feels overwhelming, just know that a Dip Party need not be a laborious affair. The dips can be as involved (from-scratch 7-Layer) or uninvolved (open a package of hummus) as you want, but as with most things, I prefer somewhere in the middle: Something that takes about five minutes to make, can be done ahead of time, and doesn\u2019t require hauling out any special equipment.Since I am a CDP (Creamy Dip Person), this means starting with store-bought sour cream, Greek yogurt, cream cheese, or ricotta. (And at least one tab of Lactaid, if we're being honest). Season your dairy product of choice with a good amount of kosher salt, freshly cracked black pepper, and fresh lemon juice before continuing. Be generous: It should be salty, tangy, and extremely delicious all on its own. If I were making dip just for me, I could stop here\u2014yes, I will happily eat seasoned cream cheese straight from a bowl\u2014but I do like to class it up for guests with several different mix-ins.When it comes to what you can and cannot add to your creamy dip base, there are truly no limits. Similarly to how one would assemble a boyband, for a truly successful Dip Party, all dip demographics must be represented: You\u2019ll need the toasty, nutty one (turmeric + tahini + labne!), the tangy, herby one (lemony salsa verde + yogurt!) and my favorite, the fiery, spicy one (chile oil + ricotta!). Regardless of flavor combinations, it\u2019s important to be mindful not to accidentally thin your dairy base out too much (i.e., adding too much lemon juice, buttermilk, etc.). There\u2019s a fine line between dippable and pourable, and you don\u2019t want to cross that line.For your chosen vehicles, do not feel limited to crackers\u2014prepared raw vegetables, tiny toasts, and/or chips are all invited to the Dip Party, as long as they are sturdy enough to hang (no flimsy \"crispbreads\" or crushed potato chips allowed!).Go forth, my friends, and may your next party radiate with Big Dip Energy.Also: Don't forget to keep those drinks cold!How to Keep All That Party Booze Cold\u2014Without Using Your FridgeWhen Alison Roman hosts, the wine goes in the bathroom, not the kitchen.View StoryExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyParty TricksDipEntertainingRecipes you want to make.
