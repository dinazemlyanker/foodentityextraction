Have a question? Email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.Can you suggest some solid to-go snacks I can buy on my way to the beach? \u2014Last-Minute LailaChips and Tostitos salsaPretzels, baby carrots, and hummusBucket of Popeyes, classicTrader Joe\u2019s cold peanut udon noodle saladBag o\u2019 grapesThe biggest sandwiches available in your zip codeHear me out: shrimp cocktailWhat\u2019s a festive all-day-drinking big-batch cocktail? \u2014All-Day AnitaAdapted from a BA recipe I love: In an insulated thermos that\u2019s at least 30 oz., pour in a chilled bottle of still ros\u00e9; add \u00bc cup vermouth bianco, a sliced cucumber, and basil. Pack a can of San Pellegrino Limonata. At the beach, fill everyone\u2019s cup with ice, \u00be with ros\u00e9 sangria, and top it off with lemon soda.How do I keep all those seagulls at bay? \u2014Annoyed ApolloIntense, unwavering eye contact. Or bring a toddler.My family would always buy Life Savers so you could pop one in your mouth when you got out of the ocean. What do you consider the best palate cleanser after a salty swim? \u2014Refreshed RheaA single potato chipTrident Watermelon TwistBit o\u2019 turkeyLemon iceMouth-to-mouth from a vaccinated lifeguardIs it possible to pack a charcuterie spread without the cheese getting as sweaty as you? \u2014Meaty MelHere\u2019s what you do: Marinate the salami and Manchego with olive oil, black pepper, Marcona almonds, and lemon zest. The olive oil keeps everything from sweating! Don\u2019t forget the baguette.What\u2019s the best cooler? \u2014Insulated IgnacioForget your overachieving bear-proof cooler. You want a cooler bag, a soft one that doesn\u2019t require pallbearers to carry it a mile to your perfect spot (which is within eyesight of an ice cream truck, out of earshot of neighbors). I have the 24-can-size Sportsman model by AO Coolers. It\u2019s easy to hose out too. Pack your drinks on the bottom, and snacks on top so they don\u2019t freeze.Do I really have to wait 30+ minutes after eating to swim? \u2014Timely TreNO! The risk of getting a cramp from too much salami is low. And even if you do get one while waiting for the ideal bodysurfing wave (we both know you\u2019re out there to pee), the worst that could happen is you\u2019re a bit uncomfortable and probably whiny.What tastes good with a sprinkling of sand? \u2014Speckled SilvaNearly everything! But especially fried oyster po\u2019boys. Because eating food sprinkled with sand is a crunchy reminder that you\u2019re AT THE BEACH, not indoors, wasting away in front of a computer that\u2019s ruining your posture and whittling away your life\u2019s meaning. If you\u2019re trying to avoid a fleck of sand making its way to your mouth, I have a recommendation, but you might not like it. (Soup. It\u2019s soup.)Beach soups??? \u2014Liquid LoriA thousand times yes! A quart of cold soup is the beach food we\u2019ve needed all along. It\u2019s crumb-less, so it won\u2019t attract the gulls. It\u2019s refreshing. It doesn\u2019t bloat you out of your bikini. If you drink it out of a lidded thermos\u2014no sand! Think green gazpacho, chlodnik (Polish beet soup), cucumber yogurt (the beach is your spa), chilled corn chowder, or vichyssoise.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIs It Ever OkayEtiquetteCultureRecipes you want to make.
