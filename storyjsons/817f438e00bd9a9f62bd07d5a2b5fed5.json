My fridge door overflows with bottles of vinegary Valentina, chunky sambal oelek, and Siete\u2019s neon orange habanero hot sauce, and I love all my spicy children equally. But lately, I\u2019ve been playing favorites with Green Widow. The aptly named green hot sauce from Hudson-area fermenters Poor Devil Pepper Co. is raw, herbaceous, and decidedly alive.Green Widow is part of a renaissance of probiotic hot sauces hitting the refrigerated section\u2014and yes, these unpasteurized sauces do have to stay in the fridge all the time. Just like Greek yogurt or kimchi, each bottle is packed with good-for-you bacteria that can\u2019t survive on the shelf.All of Poor Devil Pepper Co.\u2019s hot sauces start with locally grown peppers and vegetables, which are blended down, mixed with salt, and sealed in an anaerobic environment. The microbes naturally found in vegetables kick-start the fermentation process, which continues for a few months until the mixture is ready to be blended, strained, and sold. (Poor Devil is currently working on dehydrating the leftover mash into zero-waste chile flakes, hopefully to be sold in 2021.)As an editor at Healthyish, I obviously love eating hot sauce in the name of gut health, but the real benefits of fermentation come down to flavor. Raw hot sauce has a crisp, flavorful finish that lets the natural vegetal flavor and heat shine through. Mild, it\u2019s not. Green Widow is fierier than any jalape\u00f1o-based hot sauce I\u2019ve tried, with a lingering heat that plays off warm, earthy cumin and bright lime juice. \u201cFermentation shows the true power of a jalape\u00f1o,\u201d says cofounder Jared Schwartz, who notes that using unseeded peppers and not cooking down the sauce adds to the final punch.Over the past few months, I\u2019ve added Green Widow to everything from breakfast sandwiches to fish tacos, and recently, I\u2019ve taken to adding a few dashes to simple bowls of brothy beans. It adds a fresh vegetal flavor when my fridge doesn\u2019t have any herbs to spare\u2014a welcome bit of brightness when the sun sets at 4 p.m.Green Widow Hot Sauce$7 at Poor Devil Pepper Co.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendHot SauceShoppingCondiment/SpreadRecipes you want to make.
