Traffic Just for This Beef Noodle SoupAnd I\u2019d do it again\u2014that\u2019s how much I love the version at Yang\u2019s Kitchen.By Rachel KartenJanuary 6, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Jennifer ChongFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.Before I even booked my flight to Los Angeles in November, I knew I was going to eat at Yang\u2019s Kitchen. For months, I had been seeing its beef noodle soup pop up on my Instagram. And at this point, the weather was dropping in New York\u2014and I needed it in my life. So when I got to L.A. (on a 90-degree day, no less), I drove all the way from Venice to Alhambra (a 40-minute journey on a good day) to meet the noodle-y bowl I couldn't stop thinking about.The soup is filled with a broth that\u2019s beefier than a #GymBro. That\u2019s because chef Chris Yang  simmers bones from Santa Carota cows (they eat grass and carrots!) for more than 24 hours. The wide, chewy noodles that bob in the broth are freckled like they\u2019ve been getting sun, thanks to Grist and Toll\u2019s freshly milled whole grain flour. Then there\u2019s the beef shank and brisket, both braised to peak fall-apart-y texture. And the cilantro, the scallions, and the fresh chrysanthemum greens. And the fermented mustard green relish that I want to Oprah (a verb) to every dish I eat moving forward\u2014\u201cYou get fermented mustard green relish! And you get fermented mustard green relish!\u201d I\u2019ll yell as I finish each dish with a generous dollop of the pickle-y condiment.So if you can\u2019t tell by now, the bowl was everything I imagined it would be: deeply rich and satisfying, and exactly what I now crave on both 27-degree days and 90-degree days. Oh, and yes, I posted a photo of it on my own Instagram for all the other soup scrollers out there.Go there: Yang\u2019s KitchenExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsLos AngelesRead MorerestaurantsThis Restaurant Nearly Convinced Me to Move to Los AngelesBy Emma FishmanRecipes you want to make.
