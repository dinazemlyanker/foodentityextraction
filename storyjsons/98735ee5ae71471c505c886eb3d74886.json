(Who really wants to deep-fry at home anyways?) Leave the hassle to the restaurants and instead just roast them in the oven until deeply browned.

My husband really like it too. This would also be good with other vegetables like cabbage, eggplant, or green beans. NesraJaneWyoming8/20/2021Delicious! For the sauce: instead of putting it back in the skillet at the end, you can microwave it in the bowl you\u2019re serving in. No need to make that mess. The leftover sauce is basically a delicious vegan French onion dip for chips or veggies ShelbyWyoming5/28/2021I have made a few of  Fat Choy's recipes and they are delicious!   There is absolutely no reason not to be Vegan.  Thanks for sharing these awesome dishes  with the general public. SandyN.Y.  5/27/2021SO delicious! Definitely could add another half to whole head of cauliflower. Will definitely be keeping this recipe in regular rotation!MeeshSan Mateo, CA5/24/2021This was really good. Had to sub thinly sliced onion for shallot and it worked well. One step missing from the method (IMO) is to transfer shallot and oil to the blender, not just the shallot. Feel like you could get away with 2 heads of cauli. 450 convection total oven time for me was closer to 15 min total. Next time would blend some herb directly into the miso sauce. Also had way more sauce then cauliflower, so used the left over oil from the garlic and jalape\u00f1os, added a bunch of lemon juice and more cilantro and turned it into a v good vinaigrette. BenChicago5/11/2021I loved the general vision of this recipe, but the miso sauce was too bland so I added rice vinegar, lime juice, fish sauce, soy sauce, and chili paste, which together seemed to improve it quite a bit. I also love crisped shallots and didn't want to waste the texture by blending it in with the miso sauce, so I crisped the shallots with garlic and jalapenos for the topping, which was excellent. AnonymousOregon5/10/2021Outrageously delicious. Made the dish exactly as written and would not change a thing. It's a keeper!RickSan Francisco, CA5/10/2021This was delicious ShellyBrooklyn 4/29/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titChineseEast AsianAsianCauliflowerVegetableTofuOther IngredientsMisoCondiments, Sauces & PastesWeeknight MealsEasySideDairy-FreeNut-FreeVegetarianVeganHealthyishRoastDinnerRecipes you want to make.
