Thanks to a kitchen that operates with a level of skill and craft befitting of one of Tokyo\u2019s best restaurants, the tonkatsu\u2014breaded deep-fried pork cutlets\u2014exists on a higher plane than any other in the city. The meats are luxurious and the cooking is obsessive in detail. This isn\u2018t a taste of what tonkatsu has been\u2014it\u2018s a taste of what it\u2018s become.ORDER THE: pork of your choice in the thickness you deserve. While the menu is based on a rotating selection of heritage pork, meaning that each visit might present different options, you\u2019ll always get to select how thick you want your cutlet. Most pork will have regular or deluxe options with certain types available as \u201cextra-fatty super deluxe.\u201c Be on the lookout for the two-month aged pork belly tonkatsu or the Iberico pork from Spain.THE VIBE IS: quiet. Butagumi occupies an old house in the Nishi-Azabu neighborhood, and its iconic moon-shaped window on the second floor makes it easy to spot from the street. Despite its high pedigree, dinner here is a relaxed affair.PRACTICAL STUFF: Opened from Tuesday to Sunday. Lunch is between 11:30 a.m. and 2 p.m., and dinner is from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. Closed on Mondays. The staff speaks some English and the menu is available in English as well. Reservations are recommended. The nearest subway station is Roppongi (it\u2019s a bit of a walk from the station).Photo by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneLook for the moon-shaped window on the second story.\nPhoto by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneThe chefs at Butagumi are details-obsessed.\nBy Kee Byung-keunExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
