I am a fucking garlic girl,\u201d says @exbadd1e on TikTok.Who is the garlic girl? She adds at least 40 cloves to her recipes. She\u2019s obsessed with squeezing roasted bulbs. Simply put: She is #garlicgoals. In the past couple of months, home cooks on TikTok have been adding butt-clenching amounts of garlic to soups, pasta, and bread. In one video, @foodwithliz whips up a 60-clove soup after a follower remarks \u201c40 cloves seems a little light\u201d in regards to a previous recipe. In another, @ambospanaderia smothers a loaf of bread in layers of garlic while playing the popular sound that goes, \u201cIt\u2019ll never be enough\u2026never.\u201d The videos have each garnered millions of views and comments by garlic gals and gawkers everywhere. \u201cThe breath after has disastrous potential,\u201d says one. But it\u2019s so worth it.TikTok contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.I live in a house of flavor, so when my gastroenterologist put me on a bland diet, my heart cracked in two. I mean, no garlic? The only solution was to live vicariously through these TikTok cooks. Now, adding a plethora of garlic to a recipe is nothing new\u2014garlickiest fried rice, garlic-miso mashed potatoes, roast chicken with lots of garlic\u2014but there is something truly satisfying about watching people roast several heads of garlic and squeeze the tender cloves into Dutch ovens or spread them onto thick slices of sourdough. TikTok is a visual platform, after all. And I found comfort in the fact that people think just as I do: \u201cIf it says six cloves of garlic in a recipe, I put 12.\u201dTikTok contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Garlic has always had a fandom. Last year I watched a 50-minute documentary called Garlic Is as Good as Ten Mothers that was essentially a love letter to the stinking rose. Long before @exbadd1e roared \u201cI am a garlic girl!\u201d to millions of TikTok viewers, inspiring this Mona Lisa\u2013esque portrait of a sexy garlic bulb, Les Blank directed this mouthwatering film from 1980, which features Chez Panisse chef and owner Alice Waters asking the camera, \u201cCan you smell the garlic?\u201d While watching from the Criterion Channel, I shouted back, \u201cYes!\u201d Because that\u2019s the power of garlic: It lingers in your memory long after you\u2019ve consumed it.FoodTok is also no stranger to unhinged trends: Home cooks have washed their strawberries with salt water to reveal bugs and played a game that asks viewers to guess how long it takes before they dump a whole block of cream cheese into their slow cooker. But adding dozens of cloves of garlic to bread and soup is one trend that just feels right. Just, uh, never up my nose.Explore Bon App\u00e9titLifestyleCultureRecipes you want to make.
