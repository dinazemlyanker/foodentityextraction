Like, moisture-sapping, gritty, too-sweet mounds of sadness bad. Nobody wants that, no matter how cutely those pucks are decorated or how festively they're packaged. I'm over it! I want a cookie that tastes good, first and foremost. Which is why I\u2019m forever a devotee of the OG (original glitter\u2013bomb): Chewy Molasses Cookies.Sure, I love cookies that make a visual impact. Raspberry rugelach that shine like Christmas tree ornaments? Great! Zebra cookies with a dazzling collar of ruby\u2013red sugar? Nice! But there\u2019s a simple beauty in this molasses cookie recipe, a throwback from when BA contributor Alison Roman worked in our test kitchen. (Yep: The same person who brought the world The Cookies.) They dazzle quietly, showing up without needing too much attention. Plus, they make your house smell more festive than a holiday candle store, and are a whole lot less complicated to make than any of the disappointing, look-better-than-they-taste \u201cshowstoppers\u201d that are bound to turn up at the cookie swap. What more could you ask for?Here\u2019s how to get started. Bump your oven racks to the lower and upper thirds of the oven and preheat it to 375\u00ba. Whisk together those dry ingredients and wet ingredients in separate bowls, per usual. Then, combine the mixtures\u2014no special equipment necessary!\u2014until well incorporated. Nothing fancy, folks!Okay, you should probably make these Salted Butter and Chocolate Chunk Shortbread Cookies too...\nThrow some sanding sugar into a separate shallow bowl. Scoop out dough by the tablespoonful (cookie scoops encouraged) and form into balls and roll in the sanding sugar. Plop \u2018em onto two cookie sheets lined with parchment paper and toss them into the oven. After 8\u201310 minutes, rotating the cookies halfway through, they\u2019re done and ready to relieve you from bad sugar cookie\u2013tyranny.Just like that, you\u2019ve made a batch of beautiful, pillowy cookies that twinkle ever so slightly from that sugar bath you gave them earlier. They're so much more complex tasting than they seem like they should be, with punchy hits of cinnamon, a kiss of cardamom, and just the right about of zing from ginger, all backed up by that just-the-right-amount-of-bitter molasses. They basically capture the feeling of hygge better than any cozy log cabin in Aspen. And after weeks of force-feeding yourself bland cookies, you could use a little rest.The molasses cookie recipe in question:Chewy Molasses CookiesMolasses keeps these cookies magically fresh and chewy for days.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyNever FailCookieHoliday CookiesMolassesRecipes you want to make.
