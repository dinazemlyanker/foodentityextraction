Standing at the stove, with a few friends seated at the table behind me, I\u2019ll shout, \u201cAre you ready?!\u201d and then lower my lighter to the pan. With a whoosh, a crown of blue flames jumps up from the bananas (it\u2019s usually bananas) swimming in a now rum-soaked caramel. The fire dies out, but the oohs and ahhs echo for hours afterward.A majestic way to end a meal, a flamb\u00e9 (\u201cflamed\u201d in French) is any dish that is doused in alcohol and lit on fire\u2014usually sweets, though the technique can be applied to savory items and sauces as well. Nothing about a flamb\u00e9 is subtle: From the boozy flavor to the (gonna say it again) literal fire, it\u2019s an attention-grabber deserving of its stereotype as a tableside spectacle at a fancy restaurant. But desserts made using this technique are much simpler to execute at home than they may seem. With the right tricks up your sleeve, you can collect the same oohs and ahhs without a dinner reservation or any risk of burning your sleeve.Pick the right bottle.Potency and flavor are important when choosing a liqueur or spirit to use in your flamb\u00e9ed desserts. Look for something that measures around 40 percent alcohol by volume (i.e., most spirits and liqueurs)\u2014less and you won\u2019t get real flames, more and you\u2019ll have a blaze on your hands. Choose a liqueur that will act as a complement to the other flavors in your dessert. Cr\u00eapes Suzette calls for Grand Marnier to echo the orange flavor, cherries jubilee leans toward Kirsch, and anything with winter fruit would benefit from a splash of Calvados or pear brandy.A little goes a long way.Even the tiniest drizzle of booze with the appropriate alcohol content will light on fire, so you don\u2019t need to glug very much onto your dish to get your flame on. Of course, the more alcohol you add, the longer it will burn and the boozier the finished product will taste. For the best of both worlds\u2014a balanced flavor and impressive but controllable burn\u2014max out around 1 Tbsp. alcohol per serving.Turn off the heat.The fire in a flamb\u00e9 is all show\u2014aside from burning off the alcohol in the added liquor, it\u2019s not cooking anything. So once your bananas or pile of saucy cr\u00eapes reaches your ideal state of doneness, move the pan off the heat or simply turn off the burner. This way you won\u2019t risk overcooking anything during the fiery display.Use a long-reach lighter.The flames are liable to get pretty high, so it\u2019s best to keep your face (and clothing!) away from the danger zone. Some recipes suggest lighting your flamb\u00e9 by turning on a burner and tilting your pan slightly toward the flame so it licks the edge and catches on the contents\u2014I find that unnecessarily tricky and also a little spooky. Instead, I start the fire with a long-reach lighter, the kind I use to light deep candles. You have more control over the lighting process and don\u2019t have to get too close to the action.Bic Multi Long-Reach Lighter$16 at AmazonLean in to the hot-and-cold.Play up the fire component of your dessert by serving it with something cold. Vanilla ice cream is a classic addition, but a swoosh of yogurt on the serving plate or a drizzle of cold cream straight in the pan works just as well.Relish in the ease.Especially with fruit-forward flamb\u00e9 desserts, the process is much simpler than the final plating (and blue-flame display) would suggest. Once you make bananas Foster at home, you\u2019ll turn to the recipe again and again\u2014in large part because it takes mere minutes and almost every ingredient is a fridge or pantry staple. When people come over for dinner and ask what they can bring, I\u2019ll often say a bunch of bananas and a pint of vanilla ice cream. Little do they know they\u2019re in for dinner and a show, and I\u2019ll only have one extra pan to clean.Go bananasClassic Bananas FosterOur method for lighting this retro New Orleans dessert on fire delivers maximum drama with none of the danger.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
