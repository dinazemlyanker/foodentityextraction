This is the place for people who are serious about brunching but require actually good food versus the unlimited mimosas and pale omelets that plague too many spots. Arthurs Nosh Bar fills up quickly with a mix of girlfriends catching up over brunch, young families, and out-of-towners in the know. On nice days, snag a seat outside if you can.ORDER THE: latke smorgasbord\u2014a rainbow of a plate filled with scrambled eggs, gravlax, Israeli salad, an excellent challah roll, and of course, latkes (with both applesauce and sour cream!). It\u2019s everything you want for breakfast and brunch combined. If you keep staring at the sprinkle cookies on the counter, give in. While sprinkle cookies are never the best cookie out there, these taste like a slightly better version of the too-crumbly ones you remember eating as a kid.THE VIBE IS: Brooklyn meets Montreal meets Russ & Daughters. It\u2019s a bright white space with a lot of small, subtle nods to current restaurant design trends\u2014think marble countertops, pickle jars placed just-so on shelves, and a letter pegboard announcing various drinks on offer.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day: Monday to Friday 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\u2014Carey PolisPhoto by Dominique LafondPhoto by Dominique LafondWE ALSO LOVEElenaPizza and natural wines go hand in hand at this Saint-Henri pie shopOlive + GourmandoCarb up at this charming Old Montreal brunch standbyLo\u00efcAll roads (and great p\u00e9t-nat) lead to this Saint-Henri wine barExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
