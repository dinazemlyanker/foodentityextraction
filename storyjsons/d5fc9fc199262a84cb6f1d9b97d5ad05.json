I promise! Because, despite all inclinations to the contrary\u2014including memories of that science fair experiment where I tried to keep roses alive in milk, and just general visual repulsion\u2014pork braised in milk is absolutely wonderful. It\u2019s tender, flavorful, rich, and comforting. Don\u2019t trust me? Ask an Italian grandma.Maiale al Latte is a classic Italian dish that utilizes the lactic acid in milk to break down a fatty hunk of pork. It\u2019s hard for some of us (non-Italians) to wrap our heads around this because we\u2019re so used to the French style of braising: throwing stock and wine into a pot. But if you\u2019re surrounded by farmland, cows, and pigs, Maiale al Latte starts to make a whole lot of sense.Andy Baraghani, who developed this recipe, first had Maiale al Latte as a young cook at Chez Panisse. A guest chef was throwing together a meal using leftover pork shoulder and a pot-full of local milk, the really good stuff. The dish was simple, and \u201chard to f*ck up,\u201d which is how Andy, inexperienced and eager, was assigned to look after it. His recipe keeps it unfussy, infusing the milk with garlic, sage, and lemon. Let\u2019s take a closer look.The curds were strained for this photo, a purely aesthetic decision!\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensThe aromaticsEverything comes together quick and easy. First you brown the pork shoulder and halved head of garlic. Then you wipe out the pot and add in your aromatics and milk. The sage brings a wintry herbal note, chile de arbol (or red pepper flakes) add a level of spice, big strips of lemon peel help the milk curdle and brightens up against the pork fat, and garlic is garlic. We keep the whole head of it, cut in half, rather than ask you to peel a bunch of cloves. When you serve it, squeeze the garlic out all over the pork, or on toast. \u201cIt\u2019s not a delicate dish,\u201d said Andy. \u201cYou can interact with it. Eat the garlic. Take the herbs out.\u201dThe milkIt\u2019s gotta be whole, friends. Not skim, and definitely not oat. \u201cItaly doesn\u2019t mess with skim milk,\u201d Andy told me. \u201cYou need the flavor from whole milk to stand up to the pork, you want a sauce with flavor.\u201d We can\u2019t emphasize that enough. But we\u2019ll try, with italics. Flavor. It\u2019s not an expensive dish at the end of the day, so splurge for the best milk you can find.The...curdled milkWhen it curdles, 2 \u00bd to 3 hours uncovered in the oven later, the curds take on this smooth, ricotta-like texture and are packed with, that\u2019s right, flavor. You can strain them out for a smooth sauce, but we prefer to serve them on the meat\u2014call it \u201crustic\u201d\u2014to spread alongside the melted garlic. At one point Andy referred to them as \u201cdairy blobs,\u201d which is nice.Meat notesYou CAN overcook the pork, so make sure to turn it in the oven every thirty minutes, and stop when a paring knife can cut through. You want meat you can slice\u2014not shreddy, barbecue pork. You can also swap lamb shoulder, lamb shank, veal shoulder, or chicken legs in place of pork shoulder, per Andy. Just keep an eye on cooking time (chicken will be ready faster than those shoulder cuts).Creamy polenta makes for an extra decadent pairing.\nAlex LauWhat to serve on the sideCarla Lalli Music\u2019s creamy polenta, to go full creamy-on-creamy. Or a bracing chicory salad to \u201ckeep you from palate fatigue,\u201d as people who write about food too much would say. At Chez Panisse, they made a fried sage salsa verde, which Andy has a recipe for here. That\u2019s how he\u2019d do it at home, he said, to cut through the richness of the pork.Get the recipe:Maiale al Latte (Milk-Braised Pork)This traditional Italian braised pork roast may not be one of the most photogenic dishes you\u2019ll ever make, but it sure is one of the tastiest.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPork ShoulderBraiseMilkWinterItalianRecipes you want to make.
