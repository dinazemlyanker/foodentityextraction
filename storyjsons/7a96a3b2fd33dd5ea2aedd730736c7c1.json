Slide Into the Chefs\u2019 DMsNo longer bound by traditional brick-and-mortars, chefs are using social media to rethink their dream dinner experiences.By Bettina MakalintalOctober 14, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Brittany Holloway-BrownFacebookTwitterEmailThis story is part of The New Rules of Dinner Parties, a new collection of advice, recipes, and perspectives on one of the things we\u2019ve missed the most. Read all the stories here.Strangers have been showing up at Imana\u2019s house for dinner for almost a year now. On Friday and Saturday nights, her panoramic Oakland patio transforms into Hi Felicia Supper Club, a $225-per-person fine dining experience that includes seven courses and beverage pairings. The dinner series\u2014which has counted the farm-to-table chef Alice Waters among its guests\u2014is \u201cthe most fun I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d says Imana, a longtime Bay Area hospitality worker who uses her first name only.Until local press caught on, people heard about Hi Felicia through Instagram or from friends in the know. The dinner club doesn\u2019t have a website with a menu or a public phone number for reservations\u2014only open DMs. \u201cI give almost no information to people,\u201d Imana explains. \u201cYou just show up at someone\u2019s house and it turns out to be this really carefully curated, whimsical experience overlooking the hills of Oakland.\u201d Hi Felicia is sold out through the end of the year and has, to her surprise, become a place people choose for their birthdays, anniversaries, and special celebrations. According to Imana, she\u2019d have none of that business without Instagram.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Over the past decade the food world has come to rely on Instagram: It\u2019s where new projects are announced, where diners save places to add to their \u201cmust try\u201d lists, and where everyone shows off what they\u2019re eating. But, especially during the pandemic, the platform also opened new doors, allowing laid-off pastry chefs to start successful micro-bakeries, mutual aid food projects to find communities, and pop-up restaurants to advertise meals to long waitlists without a middleman. And, as Imana found, the platform has helped pop-up dinner clubs gain traction as their customers look for novel experiences and opportunities to gather. Gaining devoted followings, these Instagram-promoted events offer up exciting potential for alternative models of dining\u2014their hosts don\u2019t need a website, much less a brick-and-mortar location or a specific culinary resum\u00e9, to make it work.Nala is the name of the large table around which Misha Lasoff and Pearl Banjurtrungkajorn host their Her Name Is Nala dinners. It seats 10 guests, the pair\u2019s ideal number, who gather around family-style food inspired by whatever looks good that week at the farmers market. When Lasoff and Banjurtrungkajorn became roommates in New York, they knew they wanted to throw dinner parties; neither of them worked in food professionally, but they had a passion for cooking together at home. Assuming the table would be so essential to their shared lives that it would be like another roommate, they dubbed it Nala after The Lion King films. \u201cWe wanted to feed our guests with the maternal energy that the mother lion feeds her little cubs,\u201d says Banjurtrungkajorn.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.The pair had their first official dinner in late 2019, mostly made up of friends. Giving the table her own Instagram page started as a bit of a joke, but after those first guests loved the events, they realized Her Name is Nala had potential as a dining club focused on intentional eating, gathering, and hosting. The project grew into early 2020 as friends brought plus-ones, as word-of-mouth spread about the Nala dinners, and as the dining club picked up followers online. The inherent vetting that comes with hearing about Nala\u2019s events from friends or from a fairly self-selecting pool online means there\u2019s a level of trust to their dinners, Banjurtrungkajorn explains. People arrive knowing that even if you don\u2019t know the person next to you, Nala will be an intimate experience similar in feel to a family meal, she says.The pandemic forced a pause in Nala\u2019s gatherings, but as conditions improved in New York, increased interest in the dinners led to weekly at-home events and twice-monthly collaborations with brands such as Marly Garden and Alimentari Fl\u00e2neur. Now, they often wonder how they can accommodate every person who DMs them to come to a dinner. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice and lovely having our friends all at a table,\u201d says Lasoff. \u201cBut for someone who doesn\u2019t know us to reach out and have interest in coming? That\u2019s such a praise.\u201d Ultimately, the pair hope to grow Nala into a full-time venture with similarly formatted dinners happening across the globe.Restaurant workers Katie Yun and Sachi Nagase have been cooking together since their college project, the Sprouted Radish Supper Club, in 2016. That spun off into their New York\u2013based food business, Both And, in 2017, which has been at various points an art collective, a pay-what-you-wish dinner series, and pop-ups at spaces like the rooftop farm Brooklyn Grange and the bar King Tai. Though Yun and Nagase have worked in traditional restaurants, Both And felt like a way to \u201cexplore new techniques and different ways of making food for people, while also really trying to take care of people and take care of each other,\u201d says Yun, who previously worked as the \u201cDreamweaver\u201d at Eleven Madison Park. That their first event was cooking soup for 400 people at Queer Soup Night, with proceeds funding immigrant families, speaks to their idea of food as community care, Yun says.Both And\u2019s pay-what-you-wish dinners, which they ran out of their apartments twice-monthly before the pandemic, allowed them to extend the attention and care of fine dining to friends who worked at caf\u00e9s and industry folks who couldn\u2019t afford to eat at the types of restaurants which employed them. (When the pandemic put their dinners on hiatus, they transitioned to mutual aid food work, like cooking meals to stock community fridges, primarily through connections from Instagram.) Unlike the hierarchy of fine dining kitchens and the frequent disconnect between guests and the people making food, \u201cBoth And was a way where we could kind of reimagine what we wanted [dining] to be,\u201d Nagase says.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.A similar ethos guides Imana of Hi Felicia. Having worked front-of-house in restaurants like the Michelin-starred Coi, she wanted to carry into her 28-seat home restaurant the most magical components of fine dining: the perfect plates, the elements dolloped and poured in front of you, the attention to detail that ensures the forks and napkins are placed just right. But she didn\u2019t want to totally replicate traditional fine dining; she wanted to leave parts of it behind, like the hierarchies and the racism and sexism the industry\u2019s known for. \u201cThere was no seat at the table for Black people, specifically Black women, in fine dining\u2014so I wanted to create one,\u201d she says.What Instagram, and its new wave of dinner club hosts, has helped prove over the past year and a half is the viability of breaking from tradition. \u201cI think what\u2019s amazing is that people are coming up with new models and new ideas, which is so important,\u201d says Yun. This is of particular interest to diners, who\u2019ve gotten used to constant novelty and new experiences to both try and to show off online. Of course, Instagram isn\u2019t perfect: It algorithmically prioritizes people who are good at using the app, and a single picture of a dish can\u2019t show all the work and people that made it come to life. But, Yun adds, the platform ultimately helps people who might not have a footing in the food world to access certain spaces and audiences. There\u2019s certainly risk, time, and money tied up in starting a new dinner club online, but the barrier to entry is lower here than in other food businesses.While a roving dinner series might be the end goal for some, it can prove to be a step toward bigger things for others. In late September, Imana made an announcement about Hi Felicia: \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018brick-and-mortar\u2019 time,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. She\u2019s now crowdfunding for a space in Oakland that\u2019ll have the same small, intimate feel as her Hi Felicia dinners and which will, ideally, create opportunities for people who might also have felt excluded by fine dining. The transition to a traditional model does come with some internal conflict (\u201cI kind of hate it,\u201d she says), but she admits that the certain types of press or awards that really bolster a new business might not come without a permanent location.While her campaign is still in its early days, Hi Felicia\u2019s hugely successful nine-month-long run has validated Imana. \u201cI said I was done being treated poorly in the industry,\u201d she says. \u201cI said I was going to change it. And I did it.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titDinner PartiesPartiesCultureLifestyleRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
