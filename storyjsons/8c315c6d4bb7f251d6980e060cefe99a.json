It won\u2019t seem revolutionary to most Americans, but wow, is it good. (Those potato rolls!)ORDER THE: butterburger, herb oil for fries, and chocolate mousse for dessert. The original location near Gothersgade is cooler, but the Indre By location doesn\u2019t sell out as quickly.THE VIBE IS: truly a gas station with a bright-green neon sign and actual pumps. There is some outdoor seating.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day, 11 a.m. until sold out. Take advantage of your jet lag and go as early as you can: They usually sell out by 5 p.m. Check its Instagram page beforehand to make sure they\u2019re still stocked.\u2014Christine MuhlkePhoto by Ditte IsagerPhoto by Ditte IsagerWE ALSO LOVESlurp Ramen JointObsessively, meticulously made ramen that\u2019s got people lining up in Indre ByApollo Bar & KantineLook at contemporary art, eat some stellar bread at this Indre By hot spotDen VandretteGet your L\u2019Anglore fix at this sunny Indre By wine barExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
