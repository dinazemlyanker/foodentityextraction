But I also buy from the bulk bins because I love to decant. That\u2019s just a fancy way of saying that as soon as I get home I transfer all of my dried goods, from sushi rice to beluga lentils to oats to cumin seeds, into their respective jars.The tool that has made decanting fun\u2014and frankly, possible\u2014is a humble funnel, which directs all of the small stuff, prone to scattering, directly to its final destination. It\u2019s my traffic controller, and it\u2019s saved me so many minutes that I would have otherwise spent dust-busting (or worrying about the pile of farro that slipped off the counter and behind the stove).The funnel also lends a hand with liquids. I use it to portion my homemade kombucha, which I pour from a huge jug into much smaller jars after the first ferment, and to transfer the olive oil from its big tin into the more manageable bottle.Last but not least, as someone who spent the greater part of my formative years deluded enough to think I\u2019d become a researcher, I welcome any kitchen tool that seems like it would be at home in a chem lab\u2014tweezers, basters, test tubes (JK, no test tubes\u2014yet!).Buy it: Norpro Stainless Steel Funnels, Set of 3, $16 on AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
