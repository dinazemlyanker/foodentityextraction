They\u2019re the ticket to stress-free, reliably moist, and super tender desserts, and they usually can be made without having to cream butter and sugar together. (Such a hassle!) Often, they\u2019re as simple to assemble as stirring together your wet and dry ingredients and popping into the oven.And when it comes to oil-based cakes, olive oil cakes will always have a special place in our hearts. They\u2019ve got everything we love about this no-fuss style of cake with the added bonus of the fruity, grassy flavors that come from good quality extra-virgin olive oil. Typically, citrus such as orange zest or lemon zest is added to accentuate the fruitier notes of the oil used. They\u2019re usually a little denser than your average birthday cake and have a tender crumb that will stay moist even after sitting on your countertop for a couple days, making them perfect for gifting. But all this talk of olive oil cake begs one very important question: What kind of olive oil should you use for baking, anyway?The short answer: nothing too pricey, nothing too cheap, but somewhere in the middle, Goldilocks-style. You definitely want an olive oil with \u201cextra-virgin\u201d on the label, but you don\u2019t have to shell out for fancy-shmancy single-estate stuff. While we\u2019re huge fans of complex, aromatic olive oils that boast peppery, herby nuances (we love the ones made by Brightland), it can get expensive when recipes call for 1\u00bd to 2 cups of olive oil for one cake.\u00a0Brightland Olive Oil Duo$74 at BrightlandOn the flip side, cheaper bulk supermarket brands are often very processed and can be too neutral and bland to lend any real flavor. If there are any unpleasant flavors or smells you\u2019re not a fan of in the oil, baking it into a cake will only put those flaws front and center. Similar to cooking with wine, the general rule of thumb should be to cook with an olive oil you would already reach for as a finishing oil, whether to dunk bread in, drizzle over salads, or to top vanilla ice cream.Mina Stone, author of Lemon, Love & Olive Oil, recommends in her cookbook to take the extra time to find a favorite, reliable brand you enjoy cooking with\u2014she\u2019s partial to Greek-origin olive oils.Lemon, Love & Olive Oil$40 $36 at Amazon\u201cGood Greek olive tastes like heavy cream and has a clean finish. It smells even and clear\u2014without the rancid undertones that are common in blended and old olive oils,\u201d she writes. \u201cMiddle Eastern and Greek grocery stores are a great place to buy olive oil; they typically have large tins of high-quality oil at a good price. If you are at your local grocery store, try to find extra-virgin olive oil that is from one particular region (not a blend).\u201dTime to get baking:Super Lemony Olive Oil CakeWhen life gives you lemons, make Mina Stone's irresistibly moist and zesty olive oil cake.\u00a0View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
