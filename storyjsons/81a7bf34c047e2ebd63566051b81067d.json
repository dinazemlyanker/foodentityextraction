At Sarafino\u2019s in Crafton, it\u2019s not complete without banana peppers. And at the Enrico Biscotti Co., kale is the star of the dish. Each place seems to have its own iteration, but among them is a universal truth: It\u2019s not a red sauce joint in Pittsburgh without beans and greens.The combination of greens and beans can be found across cultures, but scarola e fagioli, traditionally made with cannellini beans and escarole, has been embraced by Italian-Americans in Northern New Jersey, parts of Philadelphia, and, most notably, Pittsburgh. It\u2019s thought to have been brought from Southern Italy, where many of Steel City\u2019s immigrants came from between 1880 and World War I.Like Sunday sauce, greens and beans can stir up an argument over the \u201cright\u201d way to make them. Beans from a can won\u2019t do: They have to be soaked and then simmered in aromatics. As far as greens, escarole is traditional, though many stateside cooks add spinach for a layer of sweetness. The next step is to heat some olive oil in a pot over low heat with a couple garlic cloves, maybe a whole chile pepper. Once the olive oil is seasoned\u2014smell that garlic\u2014in go the greens to saut\u00e9, then the cooked beans and their liquid are added. When it\u2019s time to serve, the greens and beans are ladled into bowls\u2014always in a shallow pool of their broth\u2014then dressed with more olive oil and a sprinkling of hot pepper. And don\u2019t forget the bread (of the generic Italian variety, obviously).Or at least, this is one method. Plenty of restaurant chefs and home cooks would disagree with it, since, of course, their way is the best way.Longtime Pittsburghers trace favorite versions back to Sunday suppers with grandma at the stove. \u201cMy grandmother used to add lettuce to the mix,\u201d says Jonathan Vlasic, the chef-owner of Alla Famiglia, in the hilltop neighborhood of Allentown. Over the years, Vlasic and his wife, Brandy, have more than doubled the size of the restaurant, which is now a 250-seat dining experience featuring tableside cooking and a $68 veal chop.Despite the upgrades, greens and beans have remained on the menu since the place opened in the \u201990s. Vlasic\u2019s rendition calls for both escarole and spinach. He uses navy pea beans for \u201ca better mouthfeel,\u201d he says. And as for that liquid, \u201cYou don\u2019t want it sitting in a pool of sauce, but you kinda want sauce. You\u2019ve gotta get that viscosity that comes from the starch of the beans and the reduction of the chicken stock.\u201d The essential ingredient, he admits, is generous portion of house-made sausage. \u201cEveryone wants meat,\u201d he says, which is the most significant way he strays from the roots of the dish. Historically, this is cucina povera; meat was too expensive. Around Pittsburgh, it\u2019s now a common addition.Over on the North Side at Legends Eatery, chef-owner Dan Bartow, originally from Long Island, NY, didn\u2019t grow up eating greens and beans, but he inherited the dish by marrying into a Pittsburgh family. His restaurant\u2014a cheery yellow dining room with fewer than 50 seats\u2014hosts a roster of regulars, including Patricia Rooney, the wife of the late Dan Rooney, former owner of the Steelers. At the front corner near a stained-glass window, a plaque commemorates the Rooney family table.Since opening 17 years ago, Bartow has prepared his wife Zoe\u2019s version of greens and beans: a mix of cannellini beans, spinach, romaine, and escarole. The dish is saut\u00e9ed in a pan and served most often with a split link of house sausage, garnished with roasted red peppers. It\u2019s a dish thick with bean water, olive oil, and grated Parmesan. Usually served as a side for dinner, the dish is also a hearty main course for lunch.Over the years, Bartow has updated his menu. He\u2019s dropped pasta e fagioli\u2014he says it\u2019s \u201cold-fashioned\u201d\u2014though it\u2019s available to those who ask. But he\u2019ll always serve greens and beans. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t serve them here,\u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019d be hell to pay.\u201dMelissa McCart is the restaurant reporter and dining critic for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and an editor for Mark Bittman on Medium.com.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRed SauceItalian AmericanPittsburghRestaurantsRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
