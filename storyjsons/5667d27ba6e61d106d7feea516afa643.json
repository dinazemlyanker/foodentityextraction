The creamy alternative made from oats has grown 400 percent1 in popularity in the last four years and isn\u2019t stopping anytime soon. But not all oat drink options are created equally.There\u2019s a new kid on the block: Chobani Oat Barista Blend. This kid isn\u2019t the kind to sit quietly in the corner and be overlooked, it\u2019s the kind that deserves to be front and center of the classroom. Its versatility in hot and cold beverages, frothing capability, and taste are worthy of attention. We took it for a test drive and so did three-time world latte art champion and coffee expert Cabell Tice to see how it handles.A Taste Above the Rest\u201cIf a customer walked into a high end coffee shop five or 10 years ago and added milk or sugar to an expensive pour over, they might have been chided by a barista,\u201d Tice says. \u201cThe coffee world was focused on telling customers how to drink their coffee,\u201d he adds. That\u2019s no longer the case. Today, coffee shops and baristas are embracing the fact that customers are customizing their coffee and drinking a cup their way \u2014 often with a milk or alternative that suits their lifestyle, dietary preferences, and environmental convictions. Meaning, the quality of what\u2019s added to coffee has never been more important.Chobani is taking that to the next level with this one. Made with organic oats, Chobani Oat Barista Blend \u201cis just a touch sweet, but not too sweet at all,\u201d Tice explains. The texture is thick and full, a luxurious addition to a cup of coffee. \u201cIt\u2019s a very balanced sweetness,\u201d he adds.This One Dances Well With Many Partners\u201cWith substitutions, you have a lot of people who honestly want a lot of different things,\u201d Tice explains. \u201cSo, you\u2019re looking for an alternative that can stand up to a cold drink or a hot drink just as well as whole milk does, but still works better than the others.\u201d This one does.It carries well with espresso in cappuccinos, lattes, cortados and the like, but shines just as brightly in a golden milk latte made with turmeric and ginger or a matcha latte. With matcha, as Tice explains, \u201cit fits a lot more fluidly\u201d than a traditional milk, since both the tea and Chobani Oat Barista Blend are made with water. And the tempered sweetness means it won\u2019t overpower flavored hot or cold drinks like the popular honey cinnamon at Tice\u2019s new cafe Orchard Coffee in Waynesville, North Carolina.Frothing: Don\u2019t Mess With Our Latte ArtIn the Instagram era, we no longer expect an espresso drink to have a giant pile of light foam on top of it that requires a spoon to eat. No, we demand a perfect crema and rosetta \u2014 and maybe even some advanced latte art. \u201cCustomers want to see things that are beautiful,\u201d Tice explains.To achieve that, the base of the drink needs to receive air well when it\u2019s being steamed by a barista. \u201cBasically what you\u2019re doing when you\u2019re steaming is you\u2019re adding hot air to it. A good oat based drink is able to receive that texture and let it be something that goes throughout the whole drink and definitely the Chobani Oat Barista Blend carries that texture very well,\u201d he adds. In short, \u201cit\u2019s easy to make great latte art with this it.\u201d1Source: Datassential MenuTrends 2018. Of restaurants serving beverages, % that offer oat milk.Recipes you want to make.
