We break down every food scene in Pig to find out.By MacKenzie Chung FeganSeptember 2, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailDavid Reamer, Courtesy of NEONFacebookTwitterEmailFirst there was Taken, a film in which \u201990s A-list actor Liam Neeson\u2014now grayer, wearier, dad bod-ier\u2014embarks on a violent quest to save his kidnapped daughter. Then there was John Wick, a film in which \u201990s A-list actor Keanu Reeves\u2014weathered by personal tragedy\u2014embarks on a savage crusade to recover his stolen Mustang. Both have spawned successful franchises, and yet audiences have long been left to wonder: Wouldn\u2019t this be more compelling with a food angle?Our wait is over. Pig, available now on Amazon Prime, stars Nic Cage as a chef turned recluse on a quest to find his kidnapped truffle pig.Pig is divided into three chapters (or should I say courses?), each named after a different dish. The first, \u201cRustic Mushroom Tart,\u201d opens on a scenic river deep in the woods of Oregon. Nic Cage, looking objectively like hell, plunges his utility knife into the mossy ground and brings the soil to his mouth. Cage\u2019s character, Rob, is, you see, a chef, and the curiosity of a chef\u2019s palate is unbound by traditional wisdom like \u201cscallion cream cheese doesn\u2019t go on a cinnamon raisin bagel\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t eat dirt.\u201d Cage summons Pig, a strawberry blonde scene stealer who, off-screen, goes by the name of Brandy, and the two set out into the woods to hunt for truffles.Mushrooms in hand, Cage returns to his off-the-grid cabin to make lunch. It is here, at minute four, as Cage begins to assemble the pastry for his rustic mushroom tart, that we must begin to suspend our culinary disbelief. Cage has made a well in a pile of flour\u2014a technique used to contain liquids like buttermilk or eggs\u2014and confoundingly drops pats of butter into the center. He then picks up a palmful of fat and flour, molding it with his palms into a tight ball. \u201cIf he\u2019s making pie crust, he can\u2019t be manhandling his dough like that,\u201d warns senior food editor Christina Chaey, who questions whether Cage\u2019s hygienic practices are up to health code. \u201cThat butter is going to melt from the heat of his hands. Doesn\u2019t he want flaky layers?\u201dWhat Cage wants is to be left alone, a point he makes abundantly clear the next day to his slick Camaro-driving truffle dealer. But after nighttime intruders abduct Pig and leave Cage bloodied and unconscious (their poetic weapon of choice: the cast-iron skillet Cage used to saut\u00e9 mushrooms over an open fire), he has no choice but to leave his hermitage and embark on his quest, one that will require him to growl lines like, \u201cThey took my pig,\u201d \u201cDerrick, who has my pig?\u201d and \u201cI. Want. My pig back.\u201dLike a bedraggled Michelin-starred Odysseus, Cage must voyage to locations across Portland, passing test after test to glean information about Pig\u2019s whereabouts. He descends into a subterranean fight club where restaurant workers bid to beat the living shit out of big name chefs, telling his dealer turned sidekick, \u201cWhatever happens, just stay back.\u201d (Cage\u2019s face, already bloody and bruised from the cast-iron skillet, takes on the appearance of raw chopped steak and stays that way for the rest of the film.) He visits his former pastry chef to procure one of her famous \u201csalted baguettes.\u201d He dines at the city\u2019s hottest new hyper-local modernist restaurant, where he chastises the chef\u2014a former prep cook at Cage\u2019s shuttered restaurant\u2014for cooking deconstructed scallops bathed in Douglas fir smoke rather than the simple, honest British pub food he used to love. He explains what a persimmon is to a small child.His journey leads him to the mansion of Portland\u2019s truffle kingpin, where Cage must cook as if Pig\u2019s life depends on it, which it does. \u201cThe first thing I see is him washing his hands, so good for him. I take back what I said about his hygiene earlier,\u201d comments Chaey as Cage prepares his station. He tenderly lays some type of small bird\u2014a pigeon?\u2014on his cutting board and begins butchering with his chef\u2019s knife. \u201cThat is not the knife I\u2019d use,\u201d Chaey remarks. \u201cHe seems to be applying gradual pressure with his palm on the spine of the knife, whereas I\u2019d use blunt force with a cleaver. To cut cleanly through bone and gristle, you want a wa-CHA!\u201dSpoiler alert: Although Cage\u2019s culinary magnum opus moves his pig\u2019s captor to tears, he is, alas, too late. Pig has snuffled her last truffle. The impact of this, we learn, is inconsequential to Cage\u2019s livelihood. He doesn\u2019t need Pig to find truffles\u2014he can do it on his own. Why, then, has he risked life and limb to find her? \u201cI love her,\u201d he murmurs.Cage\u2019s off-screen love of animals is well-documented. He once owned a pair of cobras who routinely tried to kill him. He currently has a pet crow, Huginn, who flaps around a 16-foot geodesic dome. In an interview with GQ, he says that his performance in Pig required no acting\u2014he merely had to imagine what it would be like to lose Merlin, his Maine coon.Cats seem to hold a special place in Cage\u2019s heart. In 2010 he went on Letterman and talked about how he and his high school cat, Louis, loved doing psychedelic mushrooms together. \u201cHe would stare at me,\u201d Cage told Letterman, \u201cand I had no doubt that he was my brother.\u201dStream Pig, starring Nicolas Cage, on Amazon Prime VideoExplore Bon App\u00e9titCultureMoviesRecipes you want to make.
