Personal face fans. Ice cubes tucked into bra bands. Whatever that big box is in my bedroom window. But the best way, in my opinion, is by drinking a Painkiller.It\u2019s capitalized because it\u2019s a patented drink by Pusser\u2019s Rum, but I\u2019ve only had the one made by Shannon Mustipher at Glady\u2019s in Brooklyn. Her version follows Pusser\u2019s recipe but omits the orange juice: 2 oz. Pusser\u2019s rum (it must to be a real Painkiller, but don\u2019t make me explain what Navy rum is, it\u2019s too hot to think), 4 oz. pineapple juice, and 2 oz. cream of coconut. Shake all of that and serve over ice with freshly grated nutmeg on top and a wedge of orange to garnish.That is to say, a Painkiller tastes like the beach. (Which is fitting! It\u2019s the official drink of the British Virgin Islands, originating at the famous Soggy Dollar Bar.) It\u2019s creamy and tropical like a pina colada without the fuss of being frozen, with more acidic tang from the fruit juices. The rum, which has some deep molasses and baking spice notes, chills in the background so nearly undetectable you will want to order a third and get some sort of navy rum\u2013themed tattoo on a boardwalk somewhere.I asked Mustipher why the drink is so perfect and she broke it down like the cocktail genius she is (check out her new book, Tiki: Modern Tropical Cocktails, for a sailor\u2019s treasure trove of recipes): \u201cThe rum is kind of like having carbs, and the coconut cream is fat, and then you have sugar. And that\u2019s why a cheeseburger is really popular, because the receptors in your brain respond very positively to the combination of those three elements.\u201dAnd what about the name? \u201cIf you have any problems before you start having that cocktail, you won\u2019t have problems after you finish it.\u201dGo there: Glady\u2019sExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendCocktailRumCoconut CreamRecipes you want to make.
