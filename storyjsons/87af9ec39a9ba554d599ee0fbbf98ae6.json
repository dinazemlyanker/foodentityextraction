Now She\u2019s Taking Those Lessons OutsideThe founder of Re-Entry Rocks and Just Soul Catering is using food to support women through life after incarceration.By Bettina MakalintalNovember 8, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhotography by Isa ZapataFacebookTwitterEmailIn Person of Interest we talk to the people catching our eye right now about what they\u2019re doing, eating, reading, and loving. Next up is Sharon Richardson, founder of nonprofit Re-Entry Rocks and sister company \u00a0Just Soul Catering.Work with Just Soul Catering for an event and you\u2019ll get not only bubbling trays of mac and cheese or stewed oxtails and jerk chicken, but also a stake in founder Sharon Richardson\u2019s vision: one in which she\u2014and other formerly incarcerated women\u2014build their futures through food. Raised in Brooklyn\u2019s Bedford-Stuyvesant in a Caribbean family and surrounded by friends from the South, Sharon has always known good food. And in 2016, when she founded Just Soul, she took hold of its transformative power.Richardson came home in May 2010, after 20 years of incarceration for the murder of her abuser. Reentering the world was a challenge. Even seemingly banal tasks, like sending email, had evolved while she was inside, and the label of being formerly incarcerated was a barrier of its own. But when she was offered a role in a performance of The Vagina Monologues in 2016, the producers recognized Richardson\u2019s determination and suggested she become an entrepreneur. That seemed an unlikely possibility to her; after all, she didn\u2019t have money or good credit. Still, the seed was planted, and that same year Richardson joined an entrepreneurship program led by Defy Ventures, a nonprofit organization that provides employment and business training for formerly incarcerated people\u2014a group who experiences an unemployment rate nearly five times higher than the general population.Richardson had been working at another nonprofit called Steps to End Family Violence since 2010. It was her \u201cmolding ground,\u201d she says, where founder Sister Mary Nerney encouraged her to grow and stand on her own. After Nerney passed away the program\u2019s new director pushed Richardson to do her own thing, promising that Steps would always be there if she wanted to come back. \u201cAnd look at me now,\u201d Richardson says. Before starting Just Soul she\u2019d also founded the sister nonprofit Re-Entry Rocks to provide job training, creative outlets, community, and counseling to formerly incarcerated women with histories of domestic violence.I visited Richardson at the office space she shares in Queens to learn more about how food has changed not only her life but also the lives of the women she works with\u2014and to understand her dream for Just Soul\u2019s future.Our mission at Re-Entry Rocks is to\u2026 help all women and nonbinary people who are coming home and want to create a new life moving forward. I always tell people, \u201cWe need to change the way the world sees formerly incarcerated individuals, sees women, sees mothers, daughters, friends\u2014all that we are.\u201d We want to be able to help you not go back to the way life was. What better way to do it than through a group of people who have already paved the way? Having an executive director who\u2019s formerly incarcerated\u2014having a Black woman who\u2019s gone through what I've gone through, actually run the nonprofit\u2014I think is quite different.Reentry is a difficult journey\u2026 but we hold the hands of the sisters coming behind us and we create a chain that can never be broken. I thank God every day for this gift of community that was given to me. It didn\u2019t seem like a gift when I was going through it, but now that I\u2019m home, I give this gift away freely. I will bring women along with me.When I was on the inside\u2026 my mom got really sick. It was during my 18th year, going into my 19th year. I had a choice to either go to her bedside and say goodbye or to the funeral. I chose to go to the bedside visit. I lived on an honor unit and the officer allowed the women to cook, so when I came back, we all sat around and we ate and we cried, and we laughed, and we ate. Just Soul Catering and Re-Entry Rocks come from that moment.The cafeteria food inside... was so bad. That processed food is almost like part of the punishment\u2014maybe it is. You\u2019re given this food that could eventually give you high blood pressure, diabetes, possibly cancer. It\u2019s horrible. But when you\u2019re hungry, you eat. Just Soul is definitely helping to change the way formerly incarcerated women eat.When we got food packages from the outside\u2026 we would cook and share with the people who didn\u2019t get visits, didn\u2019t get packages. Food is a life-changer, it's a motivator. It's a means of sharing, a means of giving. For incarcerated women, we used that; we didn\u2019t know what we were doing, what it meant, and how it could be utilized in life after.While inside, I learned how to make\u2026 chicken, fish, and curry, and different styles of foods I was already exposed to growing up. Sometimes you\u2019re sitting around eating something really good\u2014let\u2019s just say mac and cheese and some good barbecue chicken\u2014and having a day of laughter and talking about being free. Right in that moment where everyone\u2019s so happy, the memory comes back of someone losing their child, or losing mommy while I was inside. The food\u2019s there\u2014it did its job\u2014but the sadness comes over, and then the happiness comes back. It\u2019s like yin and yang.Sharing food feels\u2026 healing. Incarceration, domestic violence, trauma. People say, \u201cFood? How does food have anything\u2026\u201d It's everything to do with it. Even though those things are going on, you must eat, you must live. Someone may be laying on their bed who just got that 25-years-to-life. You take the food to them: \u201cBaby, you\u2019ve got to eat.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t feel like it.\u201d \u201cBut you have to. It\u2019s going to give you strength. And after you finish that, there's more. Come in the kitchen with us, hang out. We\u2019ll cry with you.\u201dWe're just a small nonprofit right now\u2026 and a small catering company, but we\u2019re big in spirit. Once you\u2019re a part of Re-Entry Rocks and Just Soul Catering, you are an alum forever. When we hopefully become, one day, an amazing organization that can turn into a foundation, we can fund the women who are going to become entrepreneurs. We want to be able to tell them, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay under Re-Entry Rocks and Just Soul forever. Do your own thing; we got you.\u201dTo keep doing this work we need\u2026 our own space. It would look like this amazing commercial kitchen. You could see the sign that says, \u201cWe made it.\u201d It would have an office space where we conduct relationships with people from the outside; we don\u2019t even have our own phone now. We would have our computer room. We\u2019d have a lunchroom where we could all eat, separate from the kitchen, and possibly a caf\u00e9 to invite the community in\u2014grab three or four people off the street, introduce them to Just Soul, and say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to teach you how to make cornbread today.\u201dWe would have pictures on the wall\u2026 of our graduation ceremonies and the women walking out the door with a certificate and letter in their hands, starting their own businesses. We\u2019ve got the pictures already; we just need our own wall to put them on.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCulturePerson of InterestRead MorecultureHey, It's Your Korean DadBy Bettina MakalintalLifestyle\u2018Kid of the Internet\u2019 Quinta Brunson Wants Us to Keep Growing (and Growing and Growing)By Leigh-Ann JacksoncultureThis Book Is Making Life With Endometriosis a Whole Lot BetterBy Ali FrancisRecipes you want to make.
