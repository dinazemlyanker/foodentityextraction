So much so that I have actually secured a job as a drinks editor here at BA where I get paid to drink them. Despite nerding out all the time over amaro and naturally sparkling Chenin Blanc and mixed-culture saisons, I have another drinks-related passion, one that doesn\u2019t get shouted quite as loudly from the rooftops. And that passion is soda. So when I encounter a soda that provides the same level of enjoyment as, say, an Averna spritz, I need to shout about it from the electronic rooftops. So here we go: Casamara Club Sodas are superb, botanical, non-alcoholic beverages!Casamara Club in Detroit bases its sodas after Italian aperitivo and digestivo, which means\u2014as an amaro lover\u2014I\u2019m already on board, drawn in by the unique flavors from roots, fruits, barks, leaves, and vegetables that are infused. They come in four varieties, but my favorite is the Capo, a minty, citrusy, bright, palate-cleansing soda that conjures fantasies of lavish skiing vacations in the Italian Alps. It is an absolute stunner and my refreshing afternoon drink of choice this fall.And yes, I could sell you based on the beautifully designed label. Or the fact that they\u2019re low-sugar, low-carb, etc. But I don\u2019t have to, because whoever is running copy over at Casamara already listed possibly the greatest selling point ever: Casamara is a leisure soda. That\u2019s what they call it. How great is that? Are you drinking a soda? Oh, no. This is a leisure soda. Can\u2019t you tell by how relaxed I look at the moment?Actually, that\u2019s a good way to describe the beverage category I explore the most: leisure drinks. Whether we\u2019re talking spritzes, light-bodied wines, or botanically infused soda, I\u2019m looking to relax. And Casamara Club is one of my favorite ways to do just that.Buy it: Casamara Club Sparkling Amaro Soft Drinks, $36 for 12 bottles at Casamara ClubAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
