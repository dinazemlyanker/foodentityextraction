When something\u2019s so easy to make that you don\u2019t even need one. Welcome to It\u2019s That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.My favorite summer dinners are the ones that come together without a plan, the meals you can spontaneously throw together for friends after a long day at the beach or a few rooftop beers. And if it doesn\u2019t require that much actual cooking, like this DIY hand roll spread, all the better. I\u2019ve thrown together these temaki-style rolls so many times over the years that I\u2019ve got it down to a science. Here\u2019s how to make it all happen.First, get your rice going:As soon as this dinner plan starts to coalesce, I start my sushi rice. To make a perfect pot, rinse 1\u00bd cups short grain sushi rice in several changes of cold water until the water runs clear. Drain well in a colander, then transfer to a small saucepan. Add a scant 2 cups cold water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir rice once, cover, and reduce heat to low. Cook until water is evaporated and rice is tender, 18\u201320 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and let sit, covered, for around 10 minutes. Then, whisk 2 Tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar, 2 tsp. sugar, and 1 tsp. Diamond kosher salt together in a small bowl until the sugar dissolves. Stir that seasoned vinegar into the rice and let sit (covered so it stays warm) until everything else is assembled and it\u2019s time to eat.While the rice cooks, prepare your protein:I like to make one simple protein filling for my hand rolls, something that can easily be accomplished in the 20-ish minutes it takes for the rice to cook. While that can be slices of high-quality raw fish, that\u2019s not usually something I have on hand, so I gravitate towards gussied up fridge and pantry staples. Pan-fried strips of Spam. Ribbons of egg omelet. Or, my all-time favorite, homemade spicy tuna made with the good oil-packed stuff. To make it, stir together 2 Tbsp. mayonnaise, 1 Tbsp. Sriracha, and 1 tsp. toasted sesame oil in a medium bowl until smooth. Add white and pale green parts of 1 thinly sliced scallion and two 4-oz. cans oil-packed tuna, drained, to bowl and use a fork to gently break up bigger tuna pieces and combine with sauce. Transfer spicy tuna to a small serving bowl and garnish with toasted sesame seeds and thinly sliced dark green scallion tops. Doesn\u2019t get much easier than that!Get your garnishes together and serve:In addition to my star protein, I like to set out a bunch of other simple fillings to round out the spread while keeping things as breezy as possible. I\u2019ll slice an avocado, julienne some cucumber, chop up some store bought kimchi. If I\u2019m feeling fancy, I\u2019ll set out some extra goodies like tender fresh pea shoots or a small jar of salty trout roe. All the toppings go on one big platter along with glossy cut nori sheets, while everyone gets their own bowl of warm rice so they can fill and wrap their own hand rolls until every last slice of cucumber is gone\u2014there are never any leftovers.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimplecookingRecipes you want to make.
