If it\u2019s 8 p.m. and the pizza shop is closed, I\u2019m probably making tamagoyaki, a squat pillow formed by layers of rolled egg that can be savory or salty-sweet.\u00a0To put it in the savory camp, add a splash of dashi. That addition turns basic tamagoyaki into dashimaki, an izakaya classic that\u2019s just-set and served in thick steaming slices alongside a white pile of grated daikon. Large doses of sugar and mirin, on the other hand, skew it toward the firmer and cake-like tamago you\u2019ve seen at your favorite sushi spot.Making a Japanese omelet barely takes five minutes, so next time you have some eggs and an appetite, follow my lead.Prep Your GearBecause tamagoyaki is just layers of eggs, you can theoretically make it in a small frying pan (preferably nonstick), but a tamagoyaki pan will make this endeavor much easier. The small and rectangular pan makes the eggs easier to roll and will also create the signature rectangular shape.Old-school Japanese cookbooks will tell you that the fundamental seasonings are sugar, salt, vinegar, soy sauce, and miso. I imagine you may have these on hand already. Supplement this group with sake, mirin, and dashi or dashi powder and you\u2019ll be able to easily riff on your tamagoyaki (and you\u2019ll have the makings of many other Japanese recipes to boot).\u00a0Quick note: Mirin is rice-derived alcohol that is sweeter than sake and used to impart a subtle sweetness and koku (\u201cdepth\u201d) to foods. If you don\u2019t have it, supplement your sake with some sugar as a substitute.Assess Your MoodMy go-to tamagoyaki is the salty-sweet variation I grew up with. I add a pinch of salt, a larger pinch of sugar, and a splash of sake into the eggs (you need at least two, and I have gone as high as six) that I\u2019ve cracked into my Pyrex measuring cup. (I omit soy sauce because I want the eggs to keep their sunny hue.) You can also\u2026Lean savory: Use salt and soy sauce, no sugar.Dashimaki: Add about one tablespoon of dashi (reconstituted if you\u2019re using powder) per egg. The eggs become harder to roll with the addition of liquid, so I would recommend trying them first without dashi.Sushi-style tamago: Add the smallest amount of salt and soy sauce, a big splash of mirin, and a scant tablespoon of sugar per egg.Confetti: To any of the above, stir in some sliced scallions.Roll With ItOnce you\u2019ve seasoned your eggs and loosely mixed them (no need for frenetic beating here), set the pan over medium-high heat for a minute. Then generously oil the pan and pour in a portion of your egg, just enough so that you have a thin layer on the bottom of the pan, as if you were making a crepe. This thin layer will form bubbles and quickly set. Take a peek as the edges start to set and begin rolling the eggs away from you towards the other end of the pan. The sweeter your eggs, the more likely they are to brown on the bottom. If this bothers you, make sure you start rolling as soon as the eggs set.Once your rolled-up eggs are at the other end of the pan, pour in another thin layer of the raw egg mixture. Use chopsticks to gently lift up the cooked eggs so that the liquid-y eggs can run beneath them and cook. Then roll the cooked eggs back toward the opposite end of the pan (toward you!), wrapping that just-cooked layer around the original log as you go\u2014the roll will get fatter and fatter as more layers of egg are wrapped around the outside. You\u2019re moving the fat egg log back and forth over the thin just-cooked layer, sort of like a windshield wiper. If the going gets rough, you can always use a soft spatula to nudge it into its characteristic rectangular shape.Continue moving your roll back and forth across the pan across layers of eggs until you have run out of egg mixture. If the shape is not quite perfect when you have finished, wrap it in a clean cloth or sheet of plastic wrap and press it into a more convincing rectangle. Writing this out makes it seem quite complicated, so I recommend watching one of the many YouTube tutorials before you start.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Remember, practice makes perfect, and if you don\u2019t photograph your imperfect ones, no one will ever know.Time to EatNow that you have your steaming tamagoyaki, how will you eat it? If it\u2019s dinner time, there\u2019s no shame in eating it thickly sliced with whatever vegetables you have on hand. If you have your act together, however...\u00a0Have it for breakfast with a bowl of natto-topped rice and miso soup (or eat this as breakfast for dinner)Pack thick slices of tamagoyaki into your bento along with some onigiri (onigiri is as simple as shaping freshly shaped rice into balls or triangles with salted, slightly damp hands)Slice thinly and arrange on top of hiyashi chuukaCut your sushi-style tamago into rods and feature them at your temaki sushi partyMake a caf\u00e9-style sandwich (and have it for breakfast)!!! Butter some slices of Pullman bread, add mayonnaise, ketchup, and/or mustard, and some thin slices of cucumber. Top with as many slices of tamagoyaki as you\u2019d like. Wrapping this in parchment paper or plastic wrap and letting it sit for five minutes will allow the sandwich to meld and to slice more cleanly (into triangles, because aesthetics)Chihiro Tomioka buys chocolate chip ice cream for the chocolate chips and has written about all things Japanese at Food52.Ready to commit?Photo by Laura Murray, Food Styling by Pearl JonesIwachu Iron Tamagoyaki Omelette Pan$63 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titEggOmeletRecipes you want to make.
