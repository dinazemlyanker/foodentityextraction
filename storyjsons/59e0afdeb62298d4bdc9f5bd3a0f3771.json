But there\u2019s a catch: Our brains quickly acclimate to scents\u201415 minutes, max\u2014so a single candle will only go so far.\u201cMy recommendation is to have a bunch of different scents to create emotional atmospheres and transport yourself somewhere else,\u201d Herz says. When stocking your scent library, consider personal significance. Scents linked to memory, like a flower you grew up smelling or a perfume worn on a special vacation, are especially emotionally potent.If you\u2019re starting fresh, Herz recommends practicing some form of mindfulness technique to cultivate a positive mental state while focusing on the scent. \u201cIf you take a novel scent that you don\u2019t have an association to and smell it in the context of \u2018I\u2019m in lockdown,\u2019 it could take on a negative meaning,\u201d says Herz. \u201cIt\u2019s a cautionary tale for not using the same scent too much, but rather having a collection.\u201dNeed some inspiration? These are the candles, incense, and sprays in our scent pantry:I light one of these quince candles when I\u2019m trying to get out of a design rut\u2014or after my roommate exercises in the living room. Unlike most scents, it doesn\u2019t trigger my migraines, and one lit candle fills a large space faster than my fancy routers spread Wi-Fi. \u2013Christa Guerra, art director.Photograph by Laura MurraySeda France Japanese Quince Candle$35 at Coming SoonI use Studio Cue\u2019s deodorizing and antimicrobial Hiba Wood Atmosphere Mist to freshen up bed linens and anywhere else my dog has decided to lounge. Hiba is a type of cypress tree closely related to the hinoki wood of Commes des Gar\u00e7ons fame, and it smells like you\u2019re walking through a Japanese forest. \u2013MacKenzie Chung Fegan, commerce writerPhotograph by Laura MurrayHiba Wood Pillow Spray$18 at East ForkI tend to switch between breu resin and palo santo incense from Incausa, which partners with Indigenous artisans in the Amazon basin to sustainably hand-harvest materials. These days it\u2019s a nightly ritual to provide some calm while still working from home. \u2013Andy Baraghani, senior food editorPhotograph by Laura MurrayIncausa Breu Resin Incense Blends$19 at IncausaFig and vetiver promotes a good creative flow, landing somewhere between warm desert evening and aspirational design atelier. When it\u2019s burnt out, the ceramic vessel reincarnates as a planter, complete with a drainage hole at the bottom. \u2013Miriam Ross, associate art directorPhotograph by Laura MurrayPaddywax Wild Fig + Vetiver Form Candle$32 at PaddywaxUnlike floral or even most woodsy sprays, this one has a distinctly exuberant and crisp smell: fresh linen, lemons, and paper with a sharp burst of wintry pine. I use the atmosphere mist in my bedroom and kitchen, especially in the morning. We could all use a renewing and soothing pine-needle scent to start our quarantine work days. \u2013Allie Wist, visuals editorPhotograph by Laura MurrayHinoki Atmosphere Mist$46 at Te Plus TeI'm loyal to Shoyeido\u2019s tea leaves incense. The scent is light and green and clean with a touch of sandalwood, but it doesn\u2019t remind me of falling asleep in church or being seduced by a cult leader. I have a different set of incense for that. \u2013Alex Beggs, senior staff writerPhotograph by Laura MurrayShoyeido Tea Leaves Incense$6 at AmazonMy current favorite nighttime routine is to burn this hand-poured soy candle for half an hour or so as I read before bed. The earthy and grounding aroma of cedar, jasmine, and fig reminds me to take a few big deep breaths before lights out. \u2013Christina Chaey, associate editorPhotograph by Laura MurrayRikumo Five Elements Earth Candle$40 at RikumoExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish HomeTrendsRead MoreLifestyleHealthyish at Home: 7 Ways to Make Your Space Feel GreatBy The Healthyish TeamRecipes you want to make.
