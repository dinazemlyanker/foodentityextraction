It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Something healthyI didn\u2019t cook much during the week, but on Sunday I did make a ton of lentils, and these roasted sweet potatoes with burst cherry tomatoes, using gochujang instead of harissa. I was too lazy to make the arguably very easy lentil dressing, instead I just mixed cooked lentils with some chopped shallot I mellowed out in red wine vinegar, plus olive oil and salt. A filling, healthy lunch before spending my afternoons testing cookies as Chris Morocco slowly develops...BA\u2019s BEST CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES.Get the recipe: Black Lentil and Harissa-Roasted Veggie BowlCarla\u2019s cooking lessonsI\u2019m so excited about Carla Lalli Music\u2019s new cookbook, Where Cooking Begins , which is one of those I can give to everyone I know, universally, no matter what level of cook they are. The recipe ingredient lists are separated by pantry items you already have versus what you need to buy, meaning each recipe only seems like it\u2019s two or three ingredients. We have a preview and a few recipes on the site you should check out\u2014Carla said a lot of people are making the crispy lamb (\u201cprobably because of the cheese\u201d). Not included in this list of excellent cooking tips (make those sweet potatoes!) is the one Carla taught me last year: life is too short for uncomfortable shoes.Where Cooking Begins is available for pre-order now, so you should do that!  It comes out March 19.ByeThe biggest news this week was that Mario Batali, after several accusations of sexual misconduct, is no longer a shareholder in his restaurant group. At first you\u2019re like, oh wow, actions have consequences. But then Eater asked B&B Hospitality some follow-up questions\u201a most of which are answered with a squirmy no comment, that reveal a more complicated reality. \u201cWhat was the sum total paid out to Batali for his stake in the restaurant group?\u201d No comment. \u201cWhat were his profits on the sale?\u201d Same. Per the New York Times, he\u2019s now spending most of his time at his lake house in Michigan. Per the New York Times Facebook comments, many people are still unaware of the accusations. \u201cHopefully he opens new restaurants on his own!\u201d writes one. \u201cThis man has something to hide. There's no doubt in my mind its black mail,\u201d reads another. Oof.Welcome to the bulk lifeI live with my great aunt, who decided to join Costco this month\u2014FYI, Costco has really affordable hearing aids. I was psyched about this decision, because I love being prepared for anything (and what do you know: Costco sells a nuclear fallout shelter kit for $6,000!) On my first trip, I picked up: a jug of Kirkland extra-virgin olive oil ($15), a 6-pack of GT\u2019s kombucha ($15), a year\u2019s worth of Bounty select-a-size ($21), a 2.2-lb. bag of roasted salted almonds ($12), a 3-pound slab of salmon ($24), and probiotics that seemed like a good idea at the time ($25 for 80!). Sadly, no Kirkland jeans. What else did I miss?You can take some stuff with youIn the name of \u201cbudgets\u201d and \u201cmodern media\u201d we\u2019re moving our offices down 10 floors this week, to desks \u2153 the size. We were only allowed to pack one box of stuff, so there was a lot of purging, a charity conference room sale, and plenty of whining. What made it to your one box? I asked around. \u201cI have three different versions of Jacobsen salt,\u201d bragged Emily Schultz. Cristina Martinez is going with a pepper grinder and a bag of Reese\u2019s Thins. \u201cOlive oil and honey...desk medicine,\u201d said Brad Leone. Speaking of medicine, Molly Baz is packing Tums, while Alex Delany\u2019s got amaro. Hilary Cadigan, Amanda Shapiro, and Zoe Sessums all mentioned peanut butter. Meryl Rothstein, Sarah Jampel, and I have our precious tea stashes\u2014minimum six varieties. Carey Polis said: \u201cZa'atar! Because you never know when you\u2019ll be eating lunch and there will be a za'atar emergency?!?!?\u201d \u201cMy roasted chickpeas coated with asafetida from Patel Brothers!!!!!\u201d said Priya Krishna. \u201cMan do they make my breath stink but they are extremely delicious.\u201d Anyone unmentioned is probably bringing flaky salt. \ud83d\ude44Unnecessary food meme of the weekI can\u2019t believeI want a tofu press now?Unnecessary food feud of the weekDelany stood up from his desk and said: \u201cSomeone needs to write about \u2018orange hands.\u2019\u201d That person is me. \u201cOrange hands\u201d is the made-up but real condition in which your hands get a tacky white film from peeling an orange or clementine or Cutie or whatever. \u201cIt\u2019s the citrus oils,\u201d explained Delany, a doctor. \u201cI like it!\u201d said Carla Lalli Music, who celebrates nature. \u201cI just eat them in the bathroom, problem solved,\u201d chimed in Amiel Stanek. \u201cWait, so then do you flush the peels?\u201d I asked. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t flush,\u201d said Amiel. \u201cIt\u2019s nature\u2019s perfume!\u201d enthused Amanda Shapiro. Priya Krishna disagrees: \u201cHave straight up stopped bringing clementines in for lunch because of this.\u201d \u201cMy hands feel sticky yet dry at the same time,\u201d said Elyse Inamine. \u201cWhen the white stuff gets under your fingernails,\u201d fumed Adam Rapoport. \u201cMaddening.\u201d\u201cBut you know what\u2019s worse?\u201d provoked Amiel. \u201cButternut squash hands!\u201d Schultz shuddered at her desk and let out a quivering EwwWwwwWwww: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have to chop off my hands now.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecultureThe Best Etsy Stores for Hunting Vintage PyrexBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
