Whether it\u2019s a Twitter feud between two people I\u2019ve never met, the homepage of The Cut, an article from the print pages of GQ, or Sally Rooney\u2019s latest book (yes, even I still like to handle paper). So when I\u2019m at a bar after a long day, reading a menu is the last thing I want to do.Thankfully at W/N W/N, a recently renovated coffee shop and bar in Philly, I trust the bartenders to deliver the ideal cocktail simply by prompting them with a light description of what I\u2019d like to drink\u2014no reading required. I know from looking at the back bar alone that they\u2019ll get it right, with all the bottles of small-batch amaro, infused simple syrups, and housemade tepache and kombucha they have. And I know too that when they\u2019re not behind the bar, many of the staff are known to concoct their own experiments at home. (Take Reddy Cypress, who told me his Parmesan amaro that sounds crazy good.) So yeah, it\u2019s safe to say I know they\u2019ll pull out something that impresses.The last time I employed this strategy, one chilly November eve, I ended up with an Amaro I\u2019d never tasted before. It had an intense piney, straight-from-the-Christmas-tree flavor, and came  from a bottle with the old-school Italian label design 20-somethings (read: me) can\u2019t get enough of. It was exactly the right thing to warm me up, and get me excited for the season to come.So trust the process at W/N W/N because the bartenders know exactly what you need\u2014maybe even more than you do.Go there: W/N W/NExplore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsBarsPhiladelphiaHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make.
