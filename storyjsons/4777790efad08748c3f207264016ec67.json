(It\u2019s called Norma, if you\u2019re wondering, because its excellence is comparable to that of Vincenzo Bellini\u2019s opera by the same name.) It\u2019s got all of pasta\u2019s best qualities\u2014lots of carbs, a fun eating experience, an inherent comfiness\u2014but it\u2019s more an ooh-ahh, must-have-that spectacular than a bowl of noodles.Photo by Alex LauAnd it doesn\u2019t take much more effort. While you wait for the pasta water to boil, you\u2019ll make the \u201calla norma\u201d part of the recipe by roasting eggplant, cherry tomatoes, and smashed garlic in a big skillet the oven. Make sure that the tomatoes burst: Their juices, when combined with a heap of grated Parmesan, a couple beaten eggs, and a squeeze of tomato paste, form the sauce that coats the spaghetti and keeps it from drying out. Once the vegetables are out of the oven and the pasta is cooked\u2014use any shape you\u2019d like (campanelle, conchiglie, rigatoni), though the drama of long, swirly noodles is unbeatable\u2014all that\u2019s left to do is toss everything together, press the pasta back into that big skillet, and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the top is golden brown.Now normally I turn my nose up at such a long wait time, but it actually affords the opportunity to do the dishes, which means I can get into bed sooner after the meal is over.Beyond that, spaghetti pie, rather than ordinary spaghetti, is less time-sensitive. Whereas most sauced pastas are demanding (especially the eggy and/or cheesy variations, which will lose their creamy sheen in a matter of minutes), this pie is stable: You don\u2019t have to rush to serve and eat it, and it\u2019s even better the next day.Photo by Alex LauYou may lose those coveted crispy edges, but I recommend heating some olive oil in a heavy skillet and frying up a thick slice until the crust is brown and glistening.  Maybe sizzle an egg while you\u2019re at it. Pasta pie for breakfast? I must be a true convert.Get the recipe:Baked Pasta alla NormaCheesy, saucy baked pasta is even more fun when you can slice it into wedges.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titSpaghettiPastaEggplantTomatoRead MorecookingThis Spaghetti Pomodoro Recipe Is a Pasta Master ClassBy Amiel StanekRecipes you want to make.
