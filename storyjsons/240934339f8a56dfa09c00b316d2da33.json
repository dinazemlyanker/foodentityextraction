These are a few of them.By Emily SchultzNovember 9, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailI have a confession to make. Although, I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s a confession\u2014that word has a negative connotation. And I\u2019m not ashamed of this fact about me at all.I still watch Gossip Girl. A lot.I watch it so much I could tell you the dress Serena wore in season 4 when she goes to the ballet (it\u2019s Giovanni Rufino). Or how Blair\u2019s mom was a different actress in the pilot episode (In the pilot, Florencia Lozano played Eleanor, but Margaret Colin took the role for the next 6 seasons). But the thing I\u2019d love to focus on, the thing I think about incessantly, is how much Vitaminwater\u00ae product placement happens in this show. It\u2019s practically a tertiary character.I admit that looking back on Vitaminwater now through our current, kombucha-colored glasses is a bit confusing. But at Gossip Girl\u2019s peak, Vitaminwater was living its best life. In 2007, Glac\u00e9au sold the \u201cwater\u201d to Coca-Cola for $4.1 BILLION dollars, which is approximately how much money Blair and Chuck spent on flights to get Carter Bazen and Georgina Sparks \u201cout of New York.\u201dPan to me, a 15-year-old in suburban New Jersey rocking a denim miniskirt and an  Abercrombie t-shirt begging my mom to buy cases of the \u201cXXX\u201d flavor, aka acai, blueberry, and pomegranate. Vitaminwater had a deal in place with The CW, which aired the best teen dramas of the late 2000s: Gossip Girl, One Tree Hill, and the 90210 reboot. And this teen girl was the target audience. I needed the Blackberry they were BBMing on, the Dooney & Bourke wristlet they were carrying lip gloss in because that\u2019s all that would fit in there, and the Vitaminwater they were sipping (or not sipping, did anyone even ever drink it on camera?) The product placement was blatant\u2014and very, very effective.I\u2019m not going to take credit for dreaming up this Gossip Girl-Vitaminwater conspiracy (Gawker can). But it\u2019s been in my subconscious ever since I saw a party full of people clad in all-white sip pomegranate Vitaminwater in the season 2 premiere. And I know I\u2019m not the only one. These are some of my favorite times Vitaminwater outshone every human character in Gossip Girl.Season 2 Episode 1, \u201cSummer, Kind of Wonderful\u201dThe setting: an end-of-summer shindig in the Hamptons. Guests are supposed to wear all white, aka \u201cThe Vitaminwater White Party\u201d\u2014this was actually what it was called. They essentially replaced Diddy with a bottle of bright pink VitaminWater. Cool move.A lot to think about here: First, these are affluent Manhattanites escaping the Upper East Side for the Hamptons. They...don\u2019t need their parties sponsored. It\u2019s not Veuve Clicquot or Voss water\u2013two beverage brands often associated with luxury. It\u2019s a fluorescent liquid that comes in a plastic bottle. Alright.Another thing. This show had no problem showing 15-year-olds getting drunk in the back of limos on school nights, so why does it seem like this party is completely dry? The Vitaminwater bars are stocked with Vitaminwater only. No vodka to spike it. No quirky glasses to hold against their completely white ensembles. Nope. Just those clunky plastic bottles.Season 2 Episode 3, \u201cThe Dark Night\u201dVanessa, the most hated character other than Jack Bass, is a 17-year-old who lives in a studio apartment in Brooklyn and homeschools herself. Makes total sense. When she\u2019s not filming documentaries and talking about how much she hates the Upper East Side, she\u2019s working at various coffee shops. In this episode, she and Nate are sitting at a coffee shop that just so happens to have an entire Vitaminwater-stocked mini fridge. This isn\u2019t that crazy to me; it\u2019s just great that even the most hated character gets her own screen time with the VW. Her favorite flavor was probably Rise, which is like a watery, knock-off Sunny D. (No one liked Rise.)Season 2 Episode 10, \u201cBonfire of the Vanity\u201dIf you don\u2019t think this is simply ICONIC, please delete my number. Not only is a 15-year-old violently hungover to the point of needing glasses and a floppy hat inside of a caf\u00e9, but she\u2019s conveniently sitting next to a TOWER OF VITAMIN WATER!!! THERE IS NO CAFE IN AMERICA THAT WOULD CASUALLY HAVE A PYRAMID OF DRINKS AT A TABLE! Then to take it a step further, she even orders REVIVE. Genius marketing. Everyone had a go-to flavor. Like I mentioned before, mine was always \u201cXXX\u201d.Season 4 Episode 21, \u201cShattered Bass\u201dVITAMIN WATER. YOU DID NOT NEED TO FLEX THAT HARD!!! Here we have Eleanor and Cyrus (Blair\u2019s mom and stepdad for those who aren\u2019t on a first name basis with the cast), coming back from Paris to throw Blair and Louis an engagement party. They\u2019re drinking tea and figuring out the plans for this party when BAM! There\u2019s an incredibly normal and casual display of five Vitaminwater bottles set up on their coffee table as part of the Vitaminwater Design Competition. This competition did happen outside of Gossip Girl, in our very real life here, but it goes completely unexplained in the show. Cryptic!I don\u2019t remember when I stopped craving XXX Vitaminwater, but now it serves as a marker of time; a time when jeans sat extremely low on your hips, Penn Badgley was at the height of his career, and wellness wasn\u2019t a buzzword. It may not be my drink of choice anymore, but like that wristlet at the bottom of my childhood closet, it holds a special place in my heart.Explore Bon App\u00e9titPop CultureRecipes you want to make.
