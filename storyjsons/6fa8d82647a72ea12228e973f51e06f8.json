And yes, I cringed typing that sentence. My inordinate love of vegetables might be a side effect of working at Healthyish, but, really, it's just who I am. (I grew up snacking on whole carrots like a rabbit, with little kid buck teeth to match.) I\u2019ve eaten (and loved) Caesar salads my whole life\u2014at middle school spaghetti fundraisers and white tablecloth Italian restaurants and all the spaces in between\u2014but it never crossed my mind to actually make one for myself. I blame the intimidating-sounding process behind the traditional version\u2014you're essentially making a homemade mayo or aioli, whisking oil drop-by-drop into raw egg yolk to create a creamy sauce\u2014which isn't actually that complicated but just doesn't feel at-home doable. And then I met Basically's easy Caesar salad recipe, and everything changed.When I first looked at the recipe for Lazy Caesar Salad, which depends on the sneaky addition of store-bought mayo to create a creamy and emulsified dressing, I knew it was made for me. I decided to try it on a group of friends I had over for a dinner party\u2014usually a dicey proposition, but it looked so easy I knew I couldn't mess it up.I started by making croutons, which really just means tearing the fluffy inside of a loaf of bread into bite-sized pieces and baking them. This is highly satisfying, and how every salad recipe should start. I tossed the hunks of bread into the biggest bowl I own\u2014trust me, you will always need a larger salad bowl than expected\u2014and added salt, pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil. I arranged the fledgeling croutons on a baking sheet in a single layer, then baked them at 450\u00b0 until the croutons were golden and crispy but still a smidge squishy in the center.While the croutons cooled, I started on the dressing by grating a garlic clove into my now-empty big bowl. (The less dishes to clean, the better.) I put two anchovies on my cutting board and, using the flat side of my knife, mashed them into a paste and tossed that in the bowl along with some spicy Dijon mustard, lemon juice, and mayo, and whisked until smooth. (If you\u2019re not a huge anchovy person, just add one.) Finally, I carefully streamed in \u2153 cup of olive oil while constantly whisking to create that classic creamy, well-emulsified Caesar dressing.Why make your dressing in a small bowl (that you have to wash!) when you can make it right in the salad bowl?!\nNext came my favorite part: using a vegetable peeler to shave a big hunk of Parmesan into shards. I broke up any especially large pieces, and definitely ate a few in the process. Finally, I began constructing the whole salad by tearing two romaine hearts into bite-sized pieces, and dropped them directly into the bowl with dressing. I seasoned the lettuce generously with pepper and lightly with salt (those anchovies are pretty salty already!), then added about three-quarters of the cheese and croutons and toss gently until the lettuce is coated. (Take a look at your salad\u2014if the romaine hearts were on the smaller side and the salad looks a little soggy and sad, add some more lettuce.)Once the salad was dressed, I transferred it to a platter and sprinkled the remaining cheese and croutons over top\u2014everyone knows Caesar salad is really just an excuse to eat a bunch of dressing-soaked croutons. To turn this salad into a proper dinner, I copied every bougie country club and random hotel restaurant in existence and threw some grilled chicken on top. Naturally, it did not suck, and my friends were more than pleased.I\u2019ll be straight with you: This salad is well outside my Healthyish wheelhouse. There\u2019s no thinly shaved fennel or tahini ranch, just an anchovy-heavy dressing and a freaky quantity of croutons. It's an absurdly easy Caesar salad recipe that goes toe-to-toe with the old-school, yolk-heavy restaurant version and wins. And it's just as perfect as I remembered.Turn your kitchen into Caesar's Palace:Lazy Caesar SaladNo raw egg yolk, no problem. All the flavor you love in the classic in a quarter of the time.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titSalad DressingSaladBasicallyRead MorecookingThis Is the Summer You Start Making Homemade Salad DressingBy Alex DelanyRecipes you want to make.
