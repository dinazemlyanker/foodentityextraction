Have a question? Email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.Is it ever okay to eat tuna salad, Buffalo Wild Wings, or otherwise smelly food on a plane? \u2014Malodorous MalloryYES. It might (it will) enrage people nearby for the three minutes you smash on room temp Chicken of the Sea, but the way air circulates on airplanes means it\u2019ll dissipate eventually. (This is good news for other...situations...too. ) Air on planes is in constant circulation and it gets filtered. Otherwise we\u2019d literally die!!! There are too many definitions of objectionable smells, which is why I\u2019m encouraging this selfish behavior. Obviously you could just not, but that\u2019s freedom for ya.So what are the best foods to pack on a flight? \u2014M.M.In the random order they popped into my head, not complete:-Cheez-Its-Grain bowls-Beefeater minis from DutyFree-Steamed sweet potato with stuff on it-Kind bars-PB&J-Do people still eat trail mix?-Muffuletta from Central Grocery in New Orleans-An entire cookie cake; share with the whole planeIf you get traveler\u2019s stomach and are out in public, far from your hotel, what's the pro move? What if you're at a restaurant with just a single WC? \u2014Poopy PamNice diarrhea euphemism!! I consulted with Dr. Jerry and he doesn\u2019t care how many social anxieties you have, USE THE NEAREST BATHROOM. Don\u2019t worry about society, they\u2019ll be fine. Power move: Make intense eye contact with anyone waiting for the loo on your way out, pat the sweat on your brow, and exclaim, \u201cWoof!\u201dCan you imagine if an Airbnb fridge was this stocked. The possibilities!!!\nAlex LauCan I use the soy sauce in my Airbnb fridge? \u2014Salty SusanFor what, your coffee? Massage oil? Get freaky, you\u2019re on vacation, Susan!Should you ever drink the water from a pitcher on a plane? \u2014Jittery JeanWhat pitcher? All I see are FREE CANS OF DIET GINGER ALE.How do I navigate my aversion to seafood across different regions and cultures? \u2014Come on, KatieThe same annoying way you do at home! By making it \u201ca whole thing\u201d before always ordering chicken.Should you tip in countries where it\u2019s not expected? \u2014Stingy SharonAmericans need all the help we can get with our international reputation. Tip! Maybe the dollar will be strong again and it\u2019ll actually mean something.SNACK BREAKAre you marinating enough cheese? I know I\u2019m not!Marinated ManchegoThe only thing more crowd-pleasing than cheese is marinated cheese.View RecipeIs it rude to ask for an English menu at a restaurant right away? \u2014Eager ElyseWhat\u2019s rude is that you didn\u2019t bother to learn an entire language before you came on vacation. Try harder! And don\u2019t waste everyone\u2019s time while you pretend you can even point out the mains from dessert. You can\u2019t.How early is it appropriate to start drinking on vacation? 10 a.m.? \u2014Alchy AlphonzoDepends on whether it\u2019s a fun vacation or just-got-divorced vacation. Oh wait, it turns out both are 10 a.m.Wearing a neck pillow around the airport: Cool or not cool? \u2014Cool CourtneySo cool that all of these people should have their own airport and all of the planes take them TO HELL.Don\u2019t haggle in Oklahoma City farmers\u2019 markets either!\nAlex LauIs it ever okay to haggle at a foreign farmer\u2019s market? \u2014Cheap ChesterDo you haggle at your local market with the heirloom grapes? Have you ever actually farmed before? Pay double! The world is a fragile place. Haggle over something that really matters, like your rent.How do you deal with someone you\u2019re traveling with who doesn\u2019t eat as often as you? \u2014Hungry HippocratesThis is why I don\u2019t travel with friends. Too much compromise. Too many petty slights that I\u2019ll talk about for months to years after. First you need to test the friendship with a weekend away somewhere close to home. Do they refuse to stop the car for roadside peaches? Do they understand the beauty of a lunch beer? Do they sleep in too late and miss \u201cthe sights\u201d? Make future plans accordingly by traveling with your sibling, soulmate, or support animals ONLY.That\u2019s all for now, but if you have petty etiquette questions or recipe requests for me, email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com and be too specific.
