He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.If it gets to a point where we\u2019re all holed up in our homes for a few weeks, we\u2019re going to need something to do. And, I imagine, if you\u2019re the type who subscribes to this newsletter, that might mean cooking.In days like these, the best kind of cookery is project cookery\u2014the more time a dish requires the better. Whatever it takes to not fixate on the steady crawl of coronavirus updates.To be honest, I\u2019m already at that point. So this past Saturday afternoon, I set out to make Amiel Stanek\u2019s French Onion Beef Noodle Soup. It\u2019s a riff on Taiwanese beef noodle soup, infused with the irresistible sweetness of five pounds (!) of caramelized onions.Start to finish, it took me about four hours. Nothing terribly complex or deft. But it means patiently searing off three pounds of bone-in short ribs, gradually sweating down a mountain of sliced white onions till jammy and tawny, and sizzling a medley of ginger, garlic, scallions, star anise, coriander, and cloves in the fat rendered from the ribs.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Because there are so many assertive flavors contributing to the assembly of the dish, it doesn\u2019t require that cherished, rich homemade chicken stock you\u2019ve got stowed away in your freezer. Twelve cups of water will do.It\u2019s a sweet, fragrant soup, fortified by the shredded beef ribs, and then given further substance by the last-minute addition of store-bought fresh ramen noodles (which, I\u2019ll just say, are pretty much the best thing to hit supermarkets this past decade).None of us know how the next few months will play out, but we\u2019ve all been here before, to some extent. As Carla Music pointed out last week in her newsletter, we have weathered blizzards and hurricanes and power outages by turning to our stoves to feed ourselves and those in need. And we\u2019ll do it again, if need be. We\u2019ll keep calm and we\u2019ll keep cooking.Get the recipe:French Onion Beef Noodle SoupThis super-savory dish draws inspiration from Taiwanese beef noodle soup, then gilds the lily with a Dutch oven\u2019s worth of sweet, slow-simmered onions.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterCoronavirusRead MorecookingFrench Onion\u2026Beef Noodle Soup?By Amiel StanekcookingThe Creamy-Sour Soup I Need On All Sick Days (And Winter, In General)By Priya KrishnacultureSoups, RankedBy Alex BeggscultureMake Black Bean Soup and Then (Easily!)
