But this spring what comes to mind is motion, perhaps because my own movement has been restricted due to the pandemic. There is the energy (and the audacity) of a tulip defying gravity to shoot up out of the earth. Then there\u2019s downward motion too, the power unleashed in a terrific rain or pollen storm.The energy required to gather and feed friends comes to mind as well. The menu planning, the shopping, the mad dash to declutter the apartment before friends arrive. As of press time it\u2019s not yet safe to entertain, but I\u2019m already daydreaming about it. When friends arrive they\u2019ll find a tray of lettuce cups filled with spicy bulgur, a dish bejeweled with pomegranate seeds. We feature these and many more dishes from the new cookbook Ripe Figs by Yasmin Khan, who traveled the Mediterranean listening to refugees and those who help them get on their feet by creating spaces where food begets conversation and compassion.At my dinner party the conversation will start with what we\u2019re reading (The Final Revival of Opal & Nev for me) and then escalate to the environment. I\u2019ll be armed with alarming facts\u2014the ones I learned while editing this, our sustainability issue\u2014but I\u2019ll also come with optimism, buoyed by the creative thinkers who are focused on solutions. You\u2019ll learn about how much we waste and how to combat it at home. Want a drink after you take in the magnitude of it all? You\u2019ll find companies that distill alcohol sustainably.Of course, you come to BA for the food. Our test kitchen has produced delicious recipes that use parts of produce usually thrown away, like chai made from orange peels, and pork chops topped with broccoli stem salsa verde. (Though we have plenty of wonderful vegetarian options, we\u2019re not here to tell you, even in this issue, how much meat to consume. That\u2019s a choice each individual has to make, and with two teen boys, meat is certainly in rotation at my place.) No, we\u2019re not featuring recipes from the restaurant Fat Choy just because they\u2019re vegan. We\u2019re featuring them because we\u2019re excited about Justin Lee and his food. He went meatless at Fat Choy because he\u2019s concerned about the planet and wanted to show that you can create big flavors without meat. Mission accomplished\u2014just try his Bok Choy With Brown Sauce and Crispy Garlic. We also feature Brian Yazzie, an Indigenous chef for whom sustainability means staying rooted in his community and feeding those in need.In the magazine we titled Yazzie\u2019s story \u201cThe Land Stewards.\u201d To be a steward means to spend energy taking care of something. I\u2019m going to employ my energy not just planning the dinner but thinking how, in the process of doing so, I can be more thoughtful about the earth\u2019s resources. I\u2019d love for you to join me, in ways that feel urgent and right for you.Explore Bon App\u00e9titLetter From The EditorSustainableRead MorecookingYou\u2019ve Got Time For ThisBy Dawn DaviscultureFood\u2019s Most Important Year\u2014EverBy Dawn DaviscultureI\u2019m Happy to Be HereBy Dawn DavisRecipes you want to make.
