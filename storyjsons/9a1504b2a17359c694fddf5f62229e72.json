Once Daylight Savings torpedoes my evenings into darkness, I give up on the outside world and hunker down with a bowl of feel-better chicken and rice soup or kimchi tofu stew. But this year, there\u2019s only one recipe on my radar: Obe Ata Stew with Chicken and Spinach\u2014a spicy tomato-broth-based stew with tender sweet potatoes, wilted spinach, and plenty of crispy skinned chicken.The crux of this bright but rich recipe lies in the obe ata sauce, a fiery pur\u00e9e of saut\u00e9ed tomatoes, bell peppers, habanero chiles, and onions. Infinitely versatile, it\u2019s one of the mother sauces of Nigerian cooking, anchoring everything from seafood stews and meaty braises to much-beloved jollof rice. Though everyone has their own version of the sauce (some add ginger, others Maggi seasoning cubes), we fell hard for the one Nigerian-born New Yorker \u2018Yemisi Awosan includes in her Egunsi Foodsline of vegan West African soups and stews. So when soup season approached, we asked her for a home-cook-able recipe we could make from scratch all winter long.Awosan developed this ultra-comforting chicken stew that borrows a page from her mother\u2019s playbook, saut\u00e9ing the obe ata ingredients in a bit of schmaltzy chicken fat for an extra layer of flavor. She starts by searing salted chicken legs in a large Dutch oven to get them brown and crisp, then cooks chopped bell peppers, beefsteak tomatoes, onions, and seeded habanero chiles in the rendered fat until they\u2019re soft and golden brown.\u201cYoruba people speak in proverbs, and one of the most common sayings is \u2018The soul that doesn't eat pepper (spice) is an ineffective soul,\u2019\u201d says Awosan with a laugh. \u201cFor them, having spice gives you a soul.\u201d But if you\u2019re sensitive to spice (and confident in your soul), she recommends pricking one of the habaneros with a fork and dropping it into the pot whole to gently infuse the sauce.The final step is to toss everything (minus that whole habanero, if you used it) into a blender with two cups of low-sodium chicken broth, then return the pur\u00e9e to the pot to simmer with sliced sweet potatoes and those seared chicken legs. In under an hour, you\u2019ll be rewarded with a soul-nourishing, tangy-spicy tomato and chicken stew.We may be staring down the barrel of a long soup season, but let\u2019s be real: Who needs to go outside when obe ata stew is sitting on the stove?It's soup season:Obe Ata Stew With Chicken and SpinachObe Ata is a Nigerian sauce that incorporates floral habanero chiles and bell peppers.
