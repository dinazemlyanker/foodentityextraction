Instead of using store-bought fish balls or going through the arduous process of making them from scratch, cookbook author Leela Punyaratabandhu uses voluptuous sea scallops, whose texture is similar to that of Asian-style fish balls: firm with a little bit of bounce. The bright peach sauce is a summer-inspired take on the classic Thai sweet chili sauce with which grilled fish balls are usually served. Serve this as part of Leela\u2019s summery menu for Grilled Pork Shoulder Steaks With Green Pepper Relish, Khao Niao (Thai Sticky Rice), Cantaloupe with Spicy Bacon-Cashew Crumble, Cucumber, Tomato, and Green Bean Salad, and Lime-Lemongrass Slushies.\u00a0All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Didn\u2019t have Thai chiles so used /pur\u00e9ed a sweet red pepper ( for color) and used a ton of chili flakes.\n\nAll four of us literally mopped our bowls for every lick of the sauce.  \n\nNext time will add a tad more water to thin a smidge.  Thought the pur\u00e9e would melt to clear in the frying pan, but it stayed opaque.  Definitely worth making .\nAnonymousWashington, DC9/18/2021Delicious with ripe summer peaches. Our peaches were sweet enough that we put in half the sugar recommended. We were glad we doubled the recipe, it is so tasty you will want more. AnonymousHouston8/28/2021super easy and an amazing blending of sweet and spicy. plus the presentation looks fancy. can't wait to make it again.princess diberkeley, CA8/27/2021This sauce is SO good. I doubled the recipe to have enough to serve it with thin rice noodles and it was delicious. Made mine with tofu and my boyfriend's with scallops and it paired really well with both. Definitely recommend!Lisha AlmeidaWashington DC8/9/2021This rating is incorrect; I give this recipe five stars.  Double the sauce recipe and add a bit more vinegar as another reviewer said. Can I\u2019ll swap scallops for cubes of pressed, extra firm, tofu as well. Great!! \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fCari-BKing George, VA8/9/2021Upped the Thai chilis and the heat is NO JOKE but it's SOooooOOOOooooo good. added extra vinegar too. and nixed the sugar.
