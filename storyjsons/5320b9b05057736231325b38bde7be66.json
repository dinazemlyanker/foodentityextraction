Developer Victoria Granof describes it as a cross between fondue and creamy artichoke dip (the best of both worlds, really). The secret to thick and smooth fondue is the addition of cornstarch. It absorbs any excess water, thickens the fondue, and prevents proteins in the dairy from separating or curdling. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t happen to have a fondue pot; a saucepan, small rice cooker, or an Instant Pot will keep it warm. Here it\u2019s served with crunchy vegetables, dill pickle potato chips, and a few fried butternut squash ravioli. \u2014BA Test KitchenIngredientsMakes about 5\u00bd cups6oz.

I even forgot to turn on my fondue.AnonymousLondon11/24/2021I was very excited to make this recipe but sadly it didn't live up to the hype. I followed according to instructions -- exact amounts of wine, corn starch, etc. and the the texture of it was less like fondue and more like bread dough. The top of the fondue quickly developed a thick, coagulated, brown film. Sadly had to toss it all out in the trash. Saved the bread cubes for croutons tomorrow...AnonymousNew York, NY4/30/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titDipLeekVegetableArtichokeMozzarellaCheeseWinterStarterVegetarianGluten-FreeKetoNew Year'sDinnerRecipes you want to make.
