The Food Network star keeps her shelves lined with the best olive oil, artisanal dried Italian pasta, and jars upon jars of mix-and-match ingredients and condiments to throw together dozens of recipes on the fly.The first chapter of her latest cookbook, Giada\u2019s Italy ($21 on Amazon), outlines her Italian pantry and essential fridge ingredients (copious amounts of Parmiggiano-Reggiano and Finocchio salami), but she spoke with us to share the specific brand of Calabrian chili paste she keeps on hand, a buttery olive she\u2019d eat day and night, and more.In addition to her pantry staples, her weekly grocery shop includes lemons, chicken breasts for her cat and dog (Bella and Bruno\u2014yeah, she cooks them homemade food), arugula, bananas, green grapes, fennel, salami and cheese packs for daughter Jade\u2019s lunch, dried pasta, broccoli, and of course her new Simply 7 popcorn. Check out her favorites below, and then maybe take a good hard look at your pantry\u2014is it Giada-worthy?1. Lucini Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\u201cI eat olive oil with almost everything\u2014from my oatmeal in the morning to salads to cooking with it, there\u2019s no such thing as too much olive oil,\u201d she explained over email. There is olive oil in the majority of recipes in the book, and this basic olive oil can be used for all of them. Whether cooking, raw in dressings, or a drizzling to finish, use Lucini\u2014it\u2019s that good.Buy Lucini Extra-Virgin Olive Oil for $17 on Amazon.Your shrimp cocktail doesn\u2019t look as good as the Spicy Calabrian Shrimp from Giada\u2019s Italy.\nAubrie Pick2. Tutto Calabrian Chili PasteOlive oil 2.0 is when it\u2019s filled with crushed dried chiles. De Laurentiis will throw it into everything from pasta sauces to stews to dressings for a bit of mellow heat. \u201cOne jar will last a long time,\u201d she reasons for its slightly-elevated cost. (You can also make it yourself, FYI!) One of her favorite ways to use it is a roasted Italian version of shrimp cocktail. Mix 1 lbs. large shrimp with 2 Tbsp. olive oil, 2 tsp. Calabrian chile paste, 1 tsp. Lemon zest, \u00bc tsp. Dried oregano, \u00bc tsp. Kosher salt, 1 Tbsp. lemon juice, 1 Tbsp. chopped basil, \u00bd cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and marinate for 10 minutes, and then roast at 425\u00b0 for 8\u201310 minutes.Buy Tutto Calabria Crushed Hot Chili Peppers for $15 on Amazon.3. Amore Anchovy PasteWe all have that friend who proclaims, \u201cI hate anchovies!\u201d when a Caesar salad hits the table. If you want to trick them, just use anchovy paste\u2014De Laurentiis likes the affordable-but-powerful Amore brand. \u201cAnchovy paste adds a certain salty, depth of flavor that is hard to replicate with any other ingredient. Bonus: It easily dissolves right into oil so people don\u2019t even have to know it\u2019s there,\u201d she raves. Unlike anchovy fillets, which need heat to dissolve, paste can be whisked easily into a creamy dressing or room-temp sauce. A good conversion is \u00bd tsp. paste to every fillet listed in a recipe, something she notes in her crispy chicken thighs with peppers and capers recipe.Buy Amore anchovy paste for $8 (two tubes) on Amazon.The simple crispy chicken thighs with peppers and capers from her book get extra flavor from hidden anchovies.\nAubrie Pick4. Mutti Canned Cherry TomatoesThese tomatoes are also a fan-favorite of the BA test kitchen, and De Laurentiis prefers them over a blended canned tomato sauce. \u201cThey are perfect for pasta\u2014they\u2019re more flavorful and give the perfect touch of sweetness.\u201d She also uses them in her farro and white bean minestrone rather than large whole peeled tomatoes to speed things up.Buy a 12-pack of Mutti canned cherry tomatoes for $46 on Amazon.5. Setaro Dried PastaBecause not everyone has time to make fresh pasta on a weekend, let alone a weeknight. De Laurentiis calls Setaro \u201cone of the best dried pastas on the market\u201d because \u201cit has the perfect chewiness and, when cooked al dente, tastes just like fresh pasta,\u201d she said. She appreciates pappardalle, which can stand up to a hearty spicy lamb rag\u00f9, as well as small orzo that makes a 15-minute flavorful weeknight dinner with clams, fennel, orange zest, and jarred piquillo peppers.Buy Setaro dried pasta for $10 from Pennsylvania Macaroni Company.Dishes that De Laurentiis describes as \u201cla dolce vita\u201d take longer to cook, but are worth it, like her lamb bolognese.\nAubrie Pick6. Castelvetrano OlivesDe Laurentiis eats these bright green olives from Sicily around-the-clock for the \u201cbuttery flavor that is more sweet than briny.\u201d Her favorite olives are perfect for snacking, salads, sauces, or chopping into a rosemary-olive tapenade to top sliced fried potatoes and goat cheese. That\u2019s olive, folks.Buy a 7 oz. jar of Castelvetrano olives for $5 on Thrive Market.An ideal way to consume more Castelvetranos:Photos reprinted from Giada\u2019s Italy.
