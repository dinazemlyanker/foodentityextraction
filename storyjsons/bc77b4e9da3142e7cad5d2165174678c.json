What have you been up to?Janelle Mon\u00e1e: It\u2019s gone in different stages. When there was a mandate to stay in the house, I was like, Oh, it\u2019s going to be a snow day. When you don\u2019t have school and you have your friends over and you have a good time. Then it turned into something worse. I have been depressed. I\u2019ve cried. I\u2019ve accepted. I\u2019ve adapted. I\u2019m just putting my energy into figuring out how I can be of service, how I can help.MS: Let\u2019s talk about food. Growing up, who was the cook in the family?JM: My mom was the cook\u2014and actually my grandmother was the cook too. My grandmother served food in the county jail for 25 years. They knew her as Mama. Some of the people, when they got out and wanted to get their lives on track, she would let them stay with her and cook. She was that type of incredible, empathetic, amazing woman. I remember her picking up a hot cast-iron skillet with her bare hands. Like if she had cornbread cooking in the oven, she would just pick it up. No gloves. I\u2019m like, you are just incredible, who are you?MS: You have a big extended family. What was it like when your grandma cooked for all you guys?JM: People out on the porch, people standing up in the kitchen, people in the living room, on the couch, watching TV. She was definitely that grandmother who had the plastic on her couch. You were not about to mess it up, you know what I mean?MS: What was your favorite thing that she\u2019d make for you?JM: I Stan her oatmeal raisin cookies. She used to put them in a little box and mail them to me. That was her way of sending me some comfort.\u00a0MS: You used to work at Office Depot. How did you cook and eat then, before you hit it big?JM: I had six roommates, and honestly, I used to eat a lot of ramen noodles. I\u2019d heat up pizzas. I did not eat well. I\u2019m very picky. I don\u2019t like onions. I just started to appreciate tomatoes.MS: Now you\u2019ve traveled the world. What\u2019s your favorite place to eat outside the U.S.?JM: I\u2019m gonna say Japan, hands down. Have you seen the documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi? Oh, of course you\u2019ve seen it. Watching that, I was like, I will travel just to go there.MS: How do you eat when you\u2019re on the road touring?JM: Because our shows are so high energy, if I eat too close to performing I can get a cramp. So I try to eat maybe three hours before. I used to eat the same meal before every show: chicken, rice, and green beans. People were like, You really are some sort of android robot.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
