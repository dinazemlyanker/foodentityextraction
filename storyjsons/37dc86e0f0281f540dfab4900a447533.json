This time around: how to start a spice collection and put it to use.Raw spices are like shy friends: It takes a little effort to draw them out of their shell to see their true colors. Toasting your spices in dry heat is a good start (a friendly wave, if you will), but frying those spices in oil or ghee is the ultimate ice-breaker. Also known as chhonk, tadka, vaghar, or tempering, among other names, blooming spices in fat is a South Asian cooking technique that brings the complex aromas to their fullest expression. This is because many of the flavor compounds found in spices are fat-soluble and because fat coats the tongue, bringing those aromatic compounds into contact with your taste buds for a longer period of time, like a powerful hug.Blooming spices turn whole seeds crunchy and make ground spices toasty, and on top of all that, it also leaves you with an infused oil that you can use to add a flavor boost to nearly anything, from popcorn to boiled potatoes to a ripe avocado.
