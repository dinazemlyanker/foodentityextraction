Next up is a pastry chef and fermentation specialist Jessica Wang, who sells healthful desserts to help fund her dream pickle shop.Jessica Wang has her hands full with dynamic food projects. One day she\u2019s slinging handmade butter mochi under the name Pique-Nique in Los Angeles\u2019 Far East Plaza, the next she\u2019s teaching pop-up workshops on freestyle fermentation at hot spots such as Honey Hi. Eventually, she hopes to use these various side hustles to fund her own brick-and-mortar pickle shop. She\u2019s also been a recipe tester for Lucky Peach (R.I.P.), a buyer for the beloved pantry shop and grocer Cookbook Market, and a vintage cookware seller.Checking out Wang\u2019s varied creative projects, it may come as no surprise that she attended the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore for fine arts. It was here that Wang\u2014who was born in Texas but moved to L.A. when she was five\u2014began working with food. Though Wang is not classically trained in the kitchen (beyond hovering over her mom while she made soy-braised chicken legs, gumbo, or casserole), she started cooking the food she grew up with as a cure for homesickness and eventually found her way into restaurant kitchens.Since going fully freelance this October, Wang taps into her creative college experience through events that use food as a practical and poetic medium. The Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs asked her to teach a pickling workshop focused on techniques for storing food in case of an earthquake, and she even had an opportunity to help design fermentation vessels\u2014sculptures that are meant to evolve as the active bacteria grows\u2014 currently on display at the MAK Center for Art and Architecture.Recently, Wang\u2019s main passions of pastry and pickles have been redefined by a new focus:  her own well-being. After the now-35-year-old moved to San Francisco for a dream job on the pastry team of State Bird Provisions in 2014, doctors diagnosed her with prediabetes. Shocked and worried about what this would mean for her career, she returned home to decompress and heal.\u201cI can\u2019t imagine not using that [pastry] skill set; it would be so sad if I stopped doing it completely,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen it comes down to how I feel I can contribute, I would really like to be useful and helpful [to others].\u201d Since her diagnosis, she\u2019s not only been reevaluating her relationship with sweets by finding creative swaps\u2014using ingredients like protein-rich chickpea flour instead of all-purpose flour and sweet potato fillings instead of refined sugar\u2014but using pickling workshops to help her peers learn about the benefits of probiotics in their diets.We talked to Wang about the pastry trend that annoys her most, her obsession with obscure corn varieties, and the easiest way to get into fermentation.I started taking pastry seriously\u2026 when I was working at LASA, a Filipino restaurant in Los Angeles\u2019 Chinatown. I had done a pop-up with my friend where I made pastries with cornmeal and fillings like key lime, and I brought the leftovers into work. LASA didn\u2019t have any dessert on their lunchtime menu at the time, so I reworked the recipes to fit more with Filipino flavors like coconut.The name Pique-Nique comes from...  when I was trying to be a good sport about the winters in college.  It was quite an adjustment. In response to the gross winter, I created a roaming picnic in a gallery (and even once as a pop-up in the school elevator), with a curtain screen-printed with grass as an imaginary field of flowers.The pastry trend that I find infuriating is\u2026 honeycomb\u2014not the kind that actually comes from bees, but the caramelized sugar. It\u2019s named after something natural and beautiful and yet it\u2019s literally just sugar. But, maybe, I also don\u2019t like it because the person who taught me how to make it wasn\u2019t that nice.My favorite way to spend a day is\u2026 thrifting. Going to thrift stores is like my television. I used to buy a lot of mid-century wares, Depression-era glasses, and cool cheese boards, and I would piece them together as collections. I especially loved collecting snack sets\u2014you know, those sectioned-off plates where there\u2019s a hole for cups. But, ultimately, the selling wasn\u2019t smart for my hoarder tendencies.My favorite product I discovered while working at Cookbook Market was\u2026 Dandelion Chocolate bars. Unlike other chocolate brands, Dandelion\u2019s really only have two ingredients: cacao beans and organic cane sugar. It\u2019s amazing that they can create so much flavor with so few components.Lately, my favorite snacks are\u2026 peanuts coated with sea moss from my friends\u2019 restaurant, Woon. I also enjoy fruit that\u2019s not too sweet, and right now there\u2019s a good amount of persimmon and guava. If I have it around I\u2019ll put fish floss on half an avocado, too.The easiest fermentation project to get started with is... suan cai, Chinese-style salted mustard or Napa cabbage leaves. It\u2019s literally made from two ingredients that create an environment for a third ingredient already present\u2014Lactobacillus bacteria\u2014to thrive and transform the greens into pickles!I get giddy about\u2026 corn, not that it\u2019s a new thing. But there are so many kinds of corn! I used a red cornmeal that\u2019s called \u201cBloody Butcher\u201d corn that was really fun to play with. I like exploring anything that\u2019s a variation of something I know.My current fermentation experiment is... pickling flowers. I was at my friend\u2019s house and she had cherry blossoms packed in salt! I was surprised by how the petals were still intact.Right now I'm really into\u2026treating my house like an installation. I\u2019ve been using a chair as a fruit basket.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishLos AngelesPerson of InterestInterviewsRead MoreLifestyleThis Artist Is Making Psychedelic Jelly Worlds to Explore Disability\u00a0By Adrienne MateiRecipes you want to make.
