Your Instant Pot can put them in their place.By Sarah JampelFebruary 22, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailSome may wonder\u2014some have wondered, aloud and to my face\u2014what a vegetarian like me does with an Instant Pot.And to that question, I answer: How else can you cook an entire kabocha squash\u2014no cutting, peeling, or deseeding\u2014in 20 minutes? (My next answer: Have you tried these magically creamy pressure cooker beans? My third\u2014but not final\u2014answer: I steam-cook eggs.)Ready to become an Instant Pot convert?Sure, the Instant Pot has proven itself most helpful for tenderizing tough cuts of meat or zooming through low-and-slow braises (like coq au vin) in record time. But the most underrated feature\u2014and a huge helping-hand to vegetarians during the winter doldrums\u2014is that your Instant Pot can turn an intimidating squash, root, or tuber from rock-solid to approachable and sliceable. And it does it in a whooooole lot less time than it\u2019d take to roast that same sweet potato, turnip, or\u2014heaven help you\u2014spaghetti squash in the oven (on a weeknight, the gods forbid it!).Once the vegetables are even partially cooked, they\u2019re easier to cut, scoop, and, if applicable, deseed. That means that all of those hairy, gnarly things (some may call them \u201cvegetables\u201d) that you run away from at the market\u2014rutabaga, kohlrabi, celeriac, you know the type!\u2014are also worthy candidates. And bring on the beets, those dreadful taproots that always, always, always take 30 to 40 minutes longer to cook through than I\u2019ve allotted for. Cauliflower, too.The Instant Pot can\u2014and will\u2014defeat you.\nHere\u2019s how you\u2019ll do it: Scrub the outside of your vegetable, pour a little water in the base (so that it will steam), then squeeze the veg into the IP, resting it on the steaming rack that came with it, and cook on high for 6 to 15 minutes, depending on your specimen\u2019s size. (If you\u2019ve got a mammoth squash that\u2019s too big to fit into a six-quart Instant Pot as one piece, remove its stem and cut it in half.) You won\u2019t be sure exactly how long it will take your vegetable to cook through, so start with a cautious estimate, then do a quick-release, prod it with a fork, and reassess. For sweet potatoes that are on the small side, I start with 6 minutes. For a big butternut, I go for 9.If you\u2019re planning to blend said vegetable into a soup or blitzing into a pur\u00e9e, you can pressure-cook it to the point of mush. But if you\u2019re going to roast, sear, grill, saut\u00e9, cube, or slice, or stuff it, you\u2019ll want to remove the vegetable when it\u2019s still-firm but much easier\u2014and safer\u2014to slice through.When life gives you Instant Pot squash, make this quick soup.\nPhoto by Alex LauI was in disbelief when my hefty kabocha squash came out of the Instant Pot fully cooked after 12 minutes. I let it cool for 10-ish minutes (a.k.a. my patience threshold) before I sliced it open, removed the seeds, and put it to use in this One-Skillet Squash with Spiced Chickpeas. I wish I could say I did something productive with the 45 minutes I shaved off my prep time (take that, oven-roasting), but I think I just gazed at my Instant Pot, love in my eyes.Ready to try it for yourself?One-Skillet Roasted Butternut Squash with Spiced ChickpeasStop struggling to peel and slice squash.
