Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,There are good weeks, there are bad weeks, and there are weeks that make you feel like you\u2019ve been suctioned off the planet and left to hang out in space like Sandra Bullock in Gravity. It\u2019s been one of those latter weeks for me (Houston, we have problems. Many problems). And whenever I\u2019m feeling this ungrounded, my old friend insomnia likes to get back in touch. (After all these years, he really can\u2019t take a hint.)I\u2019ve talked before about my love for Headspace, the meditation app, and we\u2019ve written about how it can help you stay sober and eat more mindfully. But I\u2019d never tried their \u201cSleepcasts\u201d until last week when, in a 3 a.m. tizzy of anxious, swirling thoughts, I dove in. Sleepcasts are basically podcasts made to bore you into unconsciousness. Each one has a narrator, who walks you through a scene. \u201cNarrator\u201d and \u201cscene\u201d are loosely defined here because there is no plot to speak of on Sleepcasts. The one I tried, \u201cNight Town,\u201d is narrated by a woman with a soothing British accent. \u201cWelcome to Night Town,\u201d she says with an ASMR-y whisper, the sound of a lone car passing in the distance. \u201cIt\u2019s a very sleepy town.\u201d Aaaand cue snoring. I\u2019ve listened to \u201cNight Town\u201d three times in the last week, though I\u2019m considering trying \u201cMidnight Launderette\u201d and am curious about \u201cCat Marina\u201d (subtitle: \u201cThese cats know how to relax\u201d).Inside the bubble.\nPhoto by Jenny Pe\u00f1asWhat I\u2019m ReadingThe weird world of injectables and how, at some point, \u201cgetting work done\u201d became something to brag about instead of something to hide. Why aren\u2019t there more Indonesian restaurants in the U.S.? So sorry for you, arugula. More and more of us are coming out as sober-curious. Also, Alex Ronan\u2019s adventure in a tropical paradise outside Berlin (with unreal photos from Jenny Pe\u00f1as).What I\u2019m WritingEverybody loves Samin Nosrat, including me, despite my best attempts at unbiased journalism. On the flip side, did you know I make my own butter? (Don\u2019t be too impressed: All it takes is a blender.)And, no, I don\u2019t actually think we should ban celery juice. If you want to puree massive quantities of the world\u2019s most underwhelming vegetable and chug it, you do you. I\u2019ll be over here with my cucumber slushy.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish EditorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletteressayRead MoreLifestyleLet Them Eat Reubens!By Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
