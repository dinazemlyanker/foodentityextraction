A few years ago, I started making a coffee drink that I call the Spritzy Americano, a mixture of seltzer, espresso, and orange juice. For a second, I thought I was a trailblazer, but then I moved past my delusions of grandeur and realized that people have probably been making a carbonated version of the Americano for quite some time.And they have. Espresso soda has been a thing in the Americas since the 1800s and even earlier than that in Europe. But the more I posted it on Instagram and carried it around the office, the more people asked me what the hell I was drinking. The citizens were curious.Espresso and orange give the Spritzy Americano its flavor.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigThe Spritzy Americano is a straightforward, refreshing, lively way to start\u2014or keep moving through\u2014your day. This is a cold, balanced, bitter beverage. Now, before you think, Ooofff, bitter? Bad coffee is bitter. Plain baking chocolate is bitter. Burnt Garlic is bitter. I hate bitter. No. Thank. You. Sir, let me clarify. The Spritzy Americano is bitter in the way that a Negroni, a bar of beautiful dark chocolate, or a complex Italian amaro is bitter. The bitterness is an integral part of the beverage, balanced by the other elements, in this case, sparkling water, orange juice, and orange peel.Most specialty mixed coffee drinks are sweet. Frappuccinos are milkshakes. Coffee tonics had their moment. Lattes topped with cinnamon and nutmeg and pumpkin shavings exist. This is not a coffee tonic or a milkshake or a declaration that the seasons are changing. The Spritzy Americano is not any of that. Here\u2019s how you make it:You want approximately 5 oz. of seltzer water, 2 oz. of espresso, and 2 oz. of fresh orange juice. This lineup is flexible, but being within \u00bd oz. of those measurements will give you the right balance\u2014just enough sweetness from the orange juice, and a body that feels neither thin nor sludgy. The texture of the Spritzy Americano is smooth and lightly carbonated. If you\u2019re the type of person who needs a sweet coffee beverage, a splash of simple syrup is acceptable.This is going to get a little nerdy for a second, but the temperature of the liquids matter here. You don\u2019t want to use cold seltzer. You should use room temperature seltzer that is poured over ice. Room temperature water will not shock the espresso when you add it to the Americano. Shocking the espresso with cold water will bring out intensely bitter flavors in the coffee, masking the fruity, roasted chocolate flavor. Letting the espresso and the seltzer cool together will make for a better drink. The liquid should be added in this order: Ice. Room temperature seltzer. Espresso. Orange juice.There's the Spritzy Americano, looking righteous.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigBut there\u2019s one more thing to add. You\u2019ve seen bartenders wave around a citrus peel over some artful cocktail masterpiece they just created, right? They do that for a reason. The oils in the peel of the citrus give a concentrated, floral, pleasantly-bitter orange flavor to the drink. Peel and bend 2 2\u201d strips of orange peel over the drink, rub them gently along the rim of the glass, and then slide them into the drink along the side of the glass. It might feel a bit extra, but this is what brings the Spritzy Americano together at the close.And you know what could bring you even closer to the Spritzy Americano? Some booze. The addition of 1\u00bd oz. of amaro takes this thing to a whole new realm. You want an amaro with some depth of flavor but not too much menthol character, something like Braulio, Averna, or Cynar.So did I invent the Spritzy Americano? No. But did I invent the Spritzy Americano Spritz? Also, probably not. None of that matters though. What matters is that you shake up your coffee routine. As the weather cools and the sky turns gray, you need to put that citrusy, caffeinated, bubbly pep in your morning step. Give your morning the ol\u2019 razzle dazzle. Give it the Spritzy Americano.More of a creamy coffee person?
