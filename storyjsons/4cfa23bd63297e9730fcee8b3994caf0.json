To the left I gaze upon the litterbox and dirty laundry pile. The ceiling is low, the concrete floor uneven, and the temperature COLD. Spiders seem to be laughing at me from their webs, which are freaking everywhere. But hey, I\u2019m down here, doing the thing.I used to go to the YMCA on a set schedule; I had a favorite locker and bike and water bottle. I\u2019d spin for a half hour and steam my worries away for 20. Since last March, though, I\u2019ve slowly built my home YMCA\u2014which is missing the locker room gossip (like \u201cwhen did sweaters get so long!\u201d), the giveaway bookshelf with a rotating array of VHS, and my spin friend, Dan\u2014but it works.Now I\u2019ve got my own low-budget \u201cgym\u201d without the commute/risk of COVID infection. Plus, it gives me reason to shower. Here\u2019s how I did it.Illustration by Marisol MuroEquipmentI bought a Schwinn IC3 stationary bike on sale at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods because I\u2019m not ready to go into debt for a Peloton (though I can\u2019t figure out how to get it to stop squeaking). Then I picked up some pandemic-surge -priced eight-pound dumbbells. I stacked up stolen sweat towels from the country\u2019s finest Hampton Inns. Dented Bluetooth speaker, yoga mat\u2026check. Instead of the steam room, I steam up my shower. Instead of the locker room gossip, I think about what\u2019s for lunch and where my life is headed. I named a spider on the stairwell Dan (sorry, Dan).Illustration by Marisol MuroWorkoutsThere\u2019s so much on YouTube, but I love Aaptiv spin classes with John (\u201clive your truth and eat your broccoli\u201d), and the Cindy Crawford workout tape from 1992 where she does crunches in jean cutoffs, leg swings on a rooftop, and has her squat form assessed by \u201cfitness expert Radu.\u201d But I decided that any movement counts as going to the gym now, and switching it up keeps things from getting boring in these very repetitive times. Some days I spin for 15 minutes, other days it\u2019s a grueling 35, or a 45-minute yoga class. All of them count! I\u2019m not training for anything other than a sedentary lifestyle. I\u2019ll do bicep-only strength training for vanity. I do not, under any circumstances, jump. I like walking a loop around the neighborhood, checking out everyone\u2019s new yard decor. Still haven\u2019t figured out Pilates.Illustration by Marisol MuroMind GamesThe final piece of equipment everyone ready to work out from home needs is that little push button in your brain that decides I\u2019m working out NOW. This is hard for me\u2014and maybe a universal hurdle for homebound humankind\u2014 so I designated three \u201cgym\u201d days a week to be reasonable with myself. I also read that it helps to build a habit if you reward yourself for the workout, whether that\u2019s with a granola scone, a post-workout nap, or a rerun of Sister, Sister. This is training your brain; it\u2019s science. The good news is that this gym is open whenever you need it to be, and towel service is included.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish HomeessayRead MoreLifestyleHealthyish at Home: 7 Ways to Make Your Space Feel GreatBy The Healthyish TeamRecipes you want to make.
