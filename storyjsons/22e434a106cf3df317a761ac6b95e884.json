For this recipe, he creates an awaze-inspired vinaigrette, using a berbere-spiced brown butter that adds some heat to sweet roasted carrots. Our advice? Make a little extra for melting over seared fish or other proteins or tossing into roasted vegetables, greens, or potatoes.This recipe was adapted from \u2018The Rise: Black Cooks and the Soul of American Food.\u2019Ingredients8 ServingsSpiced Brown Butter\u00bdcup (1 stick) unsalted butter\u00bcsmall red onion, finely chopped1sprig thyme11\u00bd\" piece ginger, peeled, coarsely chopped1small garlic clove, finely chopped\u00bctsp. ground cumin\u00bctsp. dried oregano\u215btsp. ground turmeric1tsp. berbereCarrots and Assembly2lb. carrots, cut on a diagonal into 3\" pieces6Tbsp. vegetable oil, dividedKosher salt, freshly ground pepper1orange, thinly sliced into rounds, seeds removed3Tbsp. fresh lemon juice1Tbsp. honey2tsp.

Very sophisticated flavors. Great as one of several vegetarian dishes. In first looking at this recipe I thought no way I was going to make it.  So many ingredients and steps.  But then I wanted roasted carrots tonight - and had nothing else to roast - so I went for it. Was not as hard as I thought. Had to throw together my own Berber spice blend as I did not have any. But came out great and was reasonably do-able.  Maybe will make again for friends. It\u2019s that kind of show off dish!  EssieDee Stamford ct4/13/2021Amazing. Great flavor.  Based on other reviews I turned up the heat on the butter and watched it closely.  Did not have berbere and my cardamom was pretty stale (time to order up!) so I left that out, added a chili pepper and then some cayenne before making the dressing.  also didn\u2019t have fresh Ethiopian cheese - so the tub \u2018o feta from Costco served well.  This is a wonderful way to serve carrots and probably other vegetables, too.Charlotte travelerCharlotte2/15/2021Delicious but man, did that brown butter take FOREVER. Lots of prep for a vinegarette, but worth it. Used chilis instead of berbere and goat cheese. \nAnonymousNYC1/12/2021Really tasty.  Am making it again as a side with standing rib roast for Christmas.  Substituted smoked paprika for the berbere and goat cheese for the ayib.Benjamin H.Brooklyn, NY12/26/2020This was fantastic. Will definitely make again. I opted to pair it with a Savoy chicken, ( I used the strained onion and garlic from the spiced brown butter... )  Will definitely make again.
