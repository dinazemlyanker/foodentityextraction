You can pull off this seafood boil on a weeknight, packed with any quick-cooking veg you\u2019ve got\u2014think snow peas, broccolini, carrots, and favas. Serve with white rice for sopping up that delicious jus. \u2014Lauren Schaefer, Kitty\u2019s Market, Hudson, NYThis recipe is part of Short Is Sweet, our collection of summer dishes that deliver a whole lot of deliciousness in 30 minutes or less.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

We are camping so just served it all in the pot as a soup with a baguette. \n\nDebbie ReynoldsChico8/25/2021its good.Anonymouslondon england 7/16/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titCornVegetableCarrotFava BeanBeanSweet PotatoPotatoMusselShellfishSeafoodShrimpGreen BeanSummerQuickEasyOne-Pot MealsWeeknight MealsMainNut-FreeDinnerRecipes you want to make.
