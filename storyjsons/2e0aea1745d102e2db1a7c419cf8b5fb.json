In 1982, Clarkson Potter published her first book, Entertaining\u2014a catalogue of her catering feats, including no less than three variations on an omelette party. This iconic book is still in print thirtysome years later, and it\u2019s our selection for the third month of the Bon App\u00e9tit Cookbook Club. Allow me to explain why!How many cookbooks do you actually cook out of? As something of a cookbook hoarder, I\u2019m embarrassed to admit that my answer to that is relatively few. Most of the books that come across my desk float in and out; only a scarce few are, uh, lucky enough to get stained with smudges of olive oil. So when my colleagues and I decided to launch this here Cookbook Club, we knew from the onset that we didn\u2019t want to feature only new books. We wanted this to be an opportunity to give a little love to those that had withstood the test of time. So to follow two new releases\u2014Nik Sharma\u2019s modern Indian-American tome and a sweet little book called Almonds, Anchovies, and Pancetta\u2014we knew that only one book could sum up the joy, the excess, the roquefort-stuffed aspirations of the coming holiday season: Martha Stewart\u2019s Entertaining.To kick things off, we\u2019ve got Martha\u2019s recipe for Ham and Cheese Feuillet\u00e9, which appears in the chapter of the book titled \u201cCocktails for Two Hundred: Country Fare.\u201d (Don\u2019t worry: BA food editor Molly Baz adapted the recipe to a slightly more manageable scale.) Later this week, we\u2019ll be hosting our own Cookbook Club potluck, where a bunch of us on staff will be skewering lamb and forming smoked trout into chevrons. So grab a new or old copy of the book, round up two hundred of your closest friends, and holiday party like it\u2019s 1982.Get the recipe:Ham and Cheese Feuillet\u00e9These ham-and-cheese bites are the perfect cocktail party appetizer.View RecipePick up a copy of Entertaining wherever you buy cookbooks.
