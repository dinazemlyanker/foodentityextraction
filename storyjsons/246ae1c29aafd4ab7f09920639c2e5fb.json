In colder months I pair it with hardy greens for their high mineral content. Spicy guajillo oil, zesty pickled beets, and lush sesame cr\u00e8me round out a perfect winter grain bowl. No sorghum? Sub wheat berries or even brown rice in a pinch.\u201dIngredients4 ServingsSorghum2cups sorghum, soaked overnight, drained2sprigs thyme, marjoram, or oregano2bay leaves8cups vegetable stock or water2Tbsp. plus 1 tsp.
