But medicine, according to my doctor, Dr. Jerry, it is not. Still, all it takes is a slight throat soreness or spring sneezing to send me to Emergen-City. One thousand percent of my daily dose of Vitamin-C? SOUNDS GOOD. I mix an inch of water with the particles and wait for my hands to start glowing, my sight to improve, my credit score to soar. Bring me healthhhh!Photo by Chelsie CraigBut did you know there are SO MANY EMERGEN-C FLAVORS? As I did with the Kool-Aid packet display at Kenney\u2019s pharmacy circa 1995, I stand in the aisles of Target and imagine my life with swoopy-fonted Blueberry-Acai Emergen-C in it versus old faithful Super Orange. The decision, it turns out, can be crucial. It takes some time to commit to a whole box of this stuff, and some flavors are downright swill. For the sake of health\u2013or the perception of it\u2014I taste-tested every flavor I could find in the vicinity and on Amazon to give you these Emergen-C reviews. Despite hopes and expectations, this overdose of V-C did not sprout me any extra limbs or heal that weird bump on my bicep. I even got a cold at one point! But whatcha gonna do. Here are my Emergen-C reviews, from bottom of the barrel to the top shelf.Ew, Never AgainI\u2019m sorry, chemical engineers who invented these, but Blueberry-Acai tastes like a melted sugar-free popsicle mixed with sidewalk puddle. Nearly black and murky in color, this was the only flavor I couldn\u2019t finish even sampling. There was a medicinal flavor that reminded me of torturously swooshing my mouth with fluoride at the pediatric dentist. Hard pass.Similarly, Triple Berry Blast had purple liquid Dimetapp vibes that I couldn\u2019t shake. It was sweeter than other flavors and didn\u2019t fizz up as much, and that was a textural disappointment for me (lol). I could see kids liking this one, though.Wouldn\u2019t buy Raspberry again. The concentrated flavor was nearly syrupy and overwhelmingly bubble bathy. It could be saved by diluting with seltzer and adding lime, however. You\u2019ve never made an Emergen-C cocktail before? Get with the program, people.Photo by Chelsie CraigSolidly MehThese wannabe matcha sleeves of \u201cEnergy\u201d Emergen-C crack me up. There\u2019s a tiny bit of caffeine in them. But like weddings and Super Bowl commercials, I felt nothing. They are, however, extremely fizzy and flavor-blasted. Peach-Mango was the liquid version of those gummi peach rings, and a part of me was into it, but it got old fast.Prepare for disappointment from Meyer Lemon\u2014like a primetime drama season finale, there was too much to live up to here. Nothing like the real thing, this flavor had a slight bitterness that felt like it was going for sophisticated, but ends up making you smack your lips and wonder what went wrong. Some people in the office liked this one, so I can\u2019t say it\u2019s The Worst, but no one came running to my desk to steal handfuls of it like they did others. Shameless thieves.Photo by Chelsie CraigNot Mad About TheseLemon-Lime was straight-up Gatorade when watered down, but with less water, like Mountain Dew that\u2019s been left in the backseat of your Corolla to boil. The milky yellow color looked like actual lemon juice\u2014confusing, but not deterring.Cherry had a pleasant candy flavor, if you\u2019re familiar with those plastic bags of cherry sours, which are tart but not actually sour\u2014it was like that. Tangy! Begging to be mixed with lime La Croix.If you\u2019re a pomegranate fan, Cranberry-Pomegranate is nice, like those flavored herbal, caffeine-free teas you keep years past their expiration date just in case you want to make sun tea. The pom flavor is intense, as is the brilliant violet color.For lemon lovers, Pink Lemonade is more lemony than Meyer Lemon or Lemon-Lime, so seek this one out. It\u2019s not nearly as sweet as you\u2019d expect after chugging too much Country Time at Sarah B.\u2019s house that one summer. While it\u2019s a lovely millennial pink shade, there is no taste of pink. For that, try Strawberry-Kiwi. A deep, Benetint magenta, it tastes like Fruitopia, or Snapple, or whatever was your vending machine juice of choice. Sweet as a melted Sno-Cone, I was delighted by it, but to each their own nostalgia.Photo by Chelsie CraigThe Fab FourMeet Tropical. A passionfruit-pineapple-led party that takes you to a beach where the sand is made of Vitamin-C crystals and the ocean is the peachy-pink of NARS\u2019s famous Orgasm blush. Don\u2019t you want to go there?! There\u2019s a Coppertone/pi\u00f1a colada/frozen cocktail flavor that makes you wonder: Do I like the taste of sunscreen? Yes, I love the taste of sunscreen!You can\u2019t knock Super Orange, the flavor that got us into this mess. Crayola orange with dark orange specks, it tastes just like Tropicana: familiar, buoyant and juicy, all-purpose. A hypochondriac's staple.But then Coconut-Pineapple walks in. Do you like pi\u00f1a coladas, and not getting pneumonia after getting caught in the rain? Well this Starburst yellow drink is your JAM. There\u2019s something actually creamy about this flavor, like pineapple Jarritos mixed with Dole Whip. NICE. This is my vacation Emergen-C, for special occasions.At long last, jittery with Stevia and running to the ladies\u2019 room to pee every 20 minutes, we have the winner. Tangerine! The subtle, sweet flavor has the citrus tang we love in Super Orange but isn\u2019t as candy-like. It\u2019s a crowd-pleaser that works any time of day, for any state of sniffles. And here\u2019s the thing: It actually tastes like real, ripe tangerine juice. That\u2019s hard to pull off in created-in-a-lab flavor factories, which is why it\u2019s the winner. Good luck out there, germies!Buy Tangerine Emergen-C on Amazon for $10 (and other flavors ranging from $10-$17/box)But in all seriousness\u2013you know what else is a great source of Vitamin-C?
