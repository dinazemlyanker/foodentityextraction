Beautiful waffle, where are you?By Sonia ChopraOctober 2, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Micah MortonFacebookTwitterEmailEvery Wednesday, Bon App\u00e9tit executive editor Sonia Chopra shares what\u2019s going on at BA\u2014the stories she\u2019s loved reading, the recipes she\u2019s been making, and more. If you sign up for our newsletter, you\u2019ll get her letter before everyone else.Recently I\u2019ve been craving waffles. This isn\u2019t normal for me\u2014I much prefer savory foods first thing in the morning\u2014and I think it stemmed from a convo I had with coworkers about our all-time favorite hotel breakfasts. Honestly, there\u2019s not much I love more than an international hotel\u2019s breakfast buffet. Some standouts for me include Paris, where I had the best yogurt of my life; Singapore, where our hotel had a congee bar and all kinds of noodles; Dubai, where the sheer variety was so staggering I couldn\u2019t pick a favorite dish; and Amritsar, where piping hot parathas were made to order and stuffed with our choice of spiced filling. But the image stuck in my mind after that Slack chat is a perfect plate of waffles, which I can picture so clearly that it almost feels like a stock image rather than an actual dish.Here\u2019s what I\u2019m picturing: Two thick quarters of waffle stacked and sprinkled with sugar, crisp on the outside and soft within, topped with a melting pat of butter, garnished with a few berries, and served with a tiny pitcher of maple syrup. Chances are you\u2019ve ordered this exact plate at a brunch spot, right? It\u2019s iconic. It\u2019s everywhere. But I can\u2019t remember the last time I ordered any kind of waffle\u2014outside of, obviously, late-night Waffle House excursions\u2014and once I realized that, I haven\u2019t been able to get them out of my head.So\u2014surprise!\u2014I decided that I have to make some. I\u2019ve been doing research in the archives of BA and Epicurious, starting with Epi associate editor Joe Sevier\u2019s deep dive into making crispy waffles and this great waffle maker review. On Bon App\u00e9tit, we\u2019ve got all kinds of recipes, from sweet whole wheat oat waffles, corn waffles with strawberry syrup, and chocolate-buckwheat waffles to savory loaded baked potato tot waffles and (!) Tex-Mex breakfast waffle nachos. In the October issue, we\u2019ve got a great recipe from chef Woldy Reyes for bibingka waffles made with rice flour that I\u2019m really looking forward to trying. If you have a favorite recipe, I\u2019d love to hear it: I\u2019m sonia@bonappetit.com.Here are a few other things I\u2019m loving:I grew up eating jaffles (we simply called them square sandwiches) so I\u2019m loving this jaffle maker recommendation from associate editor Ali FrancisPaola Brise\u00f1o-Gonz\u00e1les\u2019s recipe for this toasted pumpkin seed and tomato dipMore recipes: Meherwan Irani\u2019s all-purpose coconut curry, Simone Tong\u2019s cold noodles with Sichuan peppercorn dressing, Rachel Gurjar\u2019s air fryer sesame-coconut chicken tenders, Christian Reynoso\u2019s Sonoran-style potato, cheese, and tomato soupThis great interview with author Emily Itami about her lovely book Fault LinesA food lover\u2019s guide to cooking with Parkinson\u2019sOn YouTube: Andr\u00e9 Mack tries 16 boxed winesAnd on the podcast: Why would anyone open a restaurant?Explore Bon App\u00e9titLetter From The EditorCultureRead MorecookingThese Earthy-Creamy Tahini Cookies Win Best Supporting RoleBy Sonia ChopracultureWhat I Cook When I Don\u2019t Want to Cook AnythingBy Sonia ChopraRecipes you want to make.
