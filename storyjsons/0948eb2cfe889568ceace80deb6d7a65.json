So when researching recipes for her book, Ripe Figs: Recipes and Stories from Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus, she says it was a delight to find the dish at Nan restaurant on the Greek island of Lesbos, and to hear that the recipe came from a Pakistani refugee cook who had worked there. For the ultimate comfort dish, the chickpeas should become so soft that they simply melt in your mouth.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

People saying it's bland: you really have to let it reduce for as long as the recipe says to. That does make it kind of time-consuming for a weeknight dish though. Sully1/7/2022It really was bland.  Follow the advice of others to double the quantity of spices and other ingredients such as ginger and tomato paste.  I would also recommend the following:  Some green or black cardamon, a pinch of cinnamon, one or two teaspons of apple cider vinegar or lemon juice and using vegetable broth rather than water.  Jane DOntario, Canada8/31/2021This turned out really bland - will try the suggestion to double the spices next time. Might be better with drained canned tomatoes.AnonymousMexico City8/13/2021I have made this half a dozen times now, slightly obsessed. I double+ the spices, add cardamom and white pepper for punch. Also, if you used canned tomatoes make sure to omit the can\u2019s liquid... Makes it a sloppy mess. All in all, this is a really great dish!AnonymousVermont5/31/2021It was pretty good. I've had more flavorful channa masala.  Forty-five to sixty minutes cook time is long for using canned beans.  KristineLos Angeles, CA5/22/2021This was... amazing. I made it with dried chickpeas so instead of adding 2 c hot water I just added 2 c of the bean cooking liquid which maybe boosted the flavor a bit but either way this was absolutely incredible! Served it with store bought naan and can't wait to make it again!SarahIN5/14/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titPakistaniSouth AsianAsianIndianChickpeaBeanVegetableTurmericHerbs & SpicesGingerTomatoEasyMainSideDairy-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreeVegetarianVeganSimmerSaut\u00e9RamadanDinnerRecipes you want to make.
