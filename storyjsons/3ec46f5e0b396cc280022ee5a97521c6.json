Well, Things Are ChangingMeet the women driving the social media movement into a more inclusive future.By Allison GibsonJune 20, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Peter and Shruthi LappFacebookTwitterEmailWhen our Instagram feeds first became filled with vintage Westfalias and souped-up Sprinters around seven years ago, the earliest #vanlife posts showcased a certain demographic, mostly white men who grew massive followings at the start of the social media movement. They were photographers and surfers, often who\u2019d left comfortable corporate jobs to practice one (or both) of those pursuits on the road. As the influencer economy picked up speed, images became more polished and captions more aspirational, although light on the details of what made such a beautiful life possible.Now, the hashtag has over 5 million contributors, including a growing number of women with experiences as diverse as their rigs, candidly documenting the way they camp, cook, and manage self-care. They\u2019re proving that a life of tiny living and big adventure isn\u2019t limited to digital nomads, the independently wealthy, or paid influencers\u2014and they\u2019re driving vanlife culture toward a more inclusive future.Laura Hughes has been traveling by van full or part-time since 2014, now in a Sprinter she converted herself. \u201cIt was a very male-dominated environment,\u201d Hughes says of her early days traveling with her former partner before hitting the road on her own. \u201cThere was such limited representation online for women doing road travel, let alone doing it solo, or as a woman of color, or a woman with a different level of ability.\u201d In response, she began to build a vibrant community through her Women On The Road podcast, Instagram feed, and Facebook group, where women discuss everything from safe solo travel to van repair.One guest featured on the Women On The Road podcast is Bionca Smith. Two years ago, feeling crushed by debt and exhausted by a corporate sales career, Smith sold her belongings and left her job and expensive San Francisco apartment to travel abroad with her 10-year-old son. They eventually returned stateside and continued their roving lifestyle in a 1989 Ford Econoline. In her Off The Grid With A Kid Instagram account and thriving YouTube channel, Smith documents building her own motivational speaking business, facilitating her son\u2019s satellite education, planning an anti-bullying non-profit, and cooking healthier than she\u2019d previously had time or energy for.\u201cOur journey is really transparent: I\u2019m not a wealthy person,\u201d says Smith. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to sell items in the van to put gas in it.\u201d She\u2019s also faced occasional criticism by those who don\u2019t approve of her lifestyle change. \u201cYou\u2019re a single mom, you can\u2019t travel,\u201d \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be on the road, that\u2019s what white people do,\u201d she\u2019s heard them say. But her joy is steadfast and infectious. \u201cWomen of color started reaching out to me and saying, \u2018You\u2019ve inspired me\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause I see you doing it, I know that I can do it too.\u201dBut inspiration and aspiration can also cloud reality on social media. \u201cPeople who over-glorify vanlife create an unrealistic expectation for the average person,\u201d says 20-year-old Jennelle Long, who\u2019s lived for two years in her baby blue 1995 GMC Vandura Explorer with her ball python named Alfredo, sharing it all on Instagram. She found her van on Craigslist and built out the interior while sleeping on a yoga mat to save money from her full-time job.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Long still works two days a week at a sporting goods store in Silicon Valley, and sells thrifted vintage clothes as a side hustle on the road, but she spends most of her time cruising around California with her snake in search of good food and direct sunlight for her rooftop solar panel. She\u2019s upfront with her followers about the less glamorous parts of van life, like surviving off peanut butter sandwiches and peeing into a sparkly pink Nalgene bottle while street camping. \u201cAll I want to do is take a bubble bath in a nice heated home,\u201d she told her followers when she was sick earlier this year. Below a photo of herself last winter wearing rollerblades on the Venice Beach boardwalk, she wrote \u201cI\u2019m broke af and have no idea what I\u2019m doing with my life, but I\u2019ve never been happier and wouldn\u2019t change a thing.\u201dWhile the financial realities of van living can be challenging, well-followed Instagram accounts often find supplemental income through brand partnerships. More of those influencers encompass a wider range of experiences, including more women and women of color, who spark engagement through their unfiltered honesty, and yes, dreamy aesthetics.Shruthi Lapp, who is currently traveling with her husband Peter in their \u201887 Volkswagen Westfalia, recently began working with Hydro Flask. Each month, she sends the company a handful of what she calls \u201cnatural\u201d images of their products in use and posts one photo and story on her own Instagram feed. A longer-standing partnership with parts-supplier GoWesty provides the couple with discounted parts and mechanical support in exchange for photos of the van in action to be used in the company\u2019s promotional materials.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Initially, Lapp was skeptical about entering into brand ambassadorships because of what she has seen as a surplus over the past few years of staged, sponsored photos that promote an out-of-touch illusion of van living. Lapp\u2019s own feed features images enviable as those of any legacy travel publication. Their recent two-year-long trip across South America was full of dreamy pastel shots of camping in the Chilean desert. Now, as they drive through the American West, we see the sunrise-painted dunes of White Sands and mate breaks on grassy plains. But Lapp is careful to share less glamorous moments too, like digging the van out of mud and nights when dinner is a bowl of popcorn.Ultimately, her mission is to prove that there\u2019s no one right way to pursue #vanlife. \u201cIt\u2019s not really about how our van looks, it\u2019s just where it takes us,\u201d she says.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishTravelTrendsRead MorecultureThe L.A.
