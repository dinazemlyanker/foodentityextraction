It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.A hero, a hoagie, a grinder, a subOver the years, I\u2019ve used the NFL playoffs as an excuse to turn my apartment into an Italian hero shop.I run to a nearby Italian market for the meats\u2014pistachio-flecked rounds of mortadella, fat-marbled discs of coppa, thinly shaved sheets of prosciutto cotta (cooked ham; the pricey prosciutto di Parma is too chewy for hoagies, IMHO), and maybe a dried finocchiona sausage for a bit of garlicky bite.I then head to my local grocery store for the basics. First, a bunch of those simple sub rolls from the plastic bin\u2014cottony soft in the middle, a little crackly on the outside.Iceberg, which I slice into thin ribbons, or what we at BA refer to as shrettuce.A red onion that I slice super thin on a mandoline and then quick pickle them with some rice wine vinegar, a pinch of salt and sugar and a splash of water.And then I set up shop and invite whoever is around.The more I\u2019ve done it, the more I\u2019ve learned. When I first started assembling homemade heroes, I delicately stacked the meats and fixings like a deck of cards. And, don\u2019t get me wrong, it was tasty. It allowed the ribbons of meat and confetti of shrettuce to breathe a bit.Ted CavanaughBut a concerned, sub-obsessed reader DMed me after watching a video of me making these heros. He pointed out that the proper way to make an Italian hero was to employ what I\u2019ll call the horseshoe method.First, slice the roll, but not all the way through, so it lies flat. Then you lay the various, thinly sliced meats like you\u2019re tiling a floor. Then comes equally thinly-sliced provolone cheese, layered with the meats. (Although, as one of my Instagram followers pointed out, I should place the cheese on the outside so it doesn\u2019t get bunched up in the middle.) You pile on the shrettuce and shaved onions and douse them with some oil and red wine vinegar (don\u2019t be stingy), and hit \u2018em with a shake or two of dried oregano.Then you fold the whole thing over onto itself so it creates a horseshoe shape, the fixings on the inside so they don\u2019t make the bread all soggy, the meats on the outside so they don\u2019t form into a dense ball in the interior. And, oh yeah, I do like a slick of mayo with some Calabrian chile spread or chopped pickled peppers on either side of the roll. I know, I know\u2014mayo.Photo by Adam RapoportEach time I make the heros, they turn out differently. Sometimes I feel like I should\u2019ve splashed them with more vinegar. Sometimes I get the meat-to-bread ratio just right; sometimes I lean too carby.However they turn out, they\u2019re inevitably some degree of delicious. And, as a finishing touch, I\u2019ll wrap each one in wax or parchment paper before slicing it and handing it to one of my \u201ccustomers.\u201d It\u2019s a mostly-unnecessary step but it makes the sandwiches look great. And, really, what\u2019s better than a good-looking Italian hero?Get the recipe:Party-Ready Italian HerosExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterItalianSandwichRead MorecultureRob Corddry Ate This Italian Sandwich Every Week for DecadesBy Alyse WhitneycookingThe Very Important Italian Cold-Cut Sandwich RulesBy Adam Rapoport and Vincent CrosscookingThese Quick Lime-Pickled Onions Taste Like SummerBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
