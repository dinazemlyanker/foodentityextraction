It was in the midst of one of these riveting discussions that I realized I have opinions\u2014strong ones, and I\u2019d venture to say, correct ones\u2014about nachos. From the chips to the cheese, here's how I believe nachos should be composed and consumed:1. Now's not the time for flimsy chipsRemember, nachos are a finger food: Thin chips will drive you to fork nachos\u2014even worse than forking pizza (looking at you, De Blasio). So find the thicc-est chips money can buy, something with integrity. They\u2019ve got to have a hearty corn taste and be sturdy enough to handle the heft of whatever toppings you throw at (okay, on) them\u2014chicken tinga, bacon-y refried beans, carne asada. (I like the yellow corn tortilla chips by Garden of Eatin\u2019.) And even if you prefer minimal toppings, a thick chip stays crunchy longer.2. Queso is superior to broiled, shredded cheeseThe addition of hot melt-y cheese transforms a pile of chips (boring) into nachos (fascinating). Queso, homemade or not, is my cheese of choice. It stays saucy even at room temperature, which means I can eat at my typical snail\u2019s pace and still get good nacho vibes. Shredded, broiled cheddar, on the other hand, congeals into a matted web that entraps chips, beans, and salsa well before I've made a dent in the sheet tray.Some of you are probably on team shredded cheese\u2014and, fine, I get it. The chew and stretch of just-melted cheese, if you\u2019re fast enough to catch it, is one of life\u2019s greatest pleasures. For nachos, it\u2019s best to stick with cheese that\u2019s what I like to call \u201cmedium good.\u201d The super fancy cage-aged stuff can\u2019t take the heat and will break into pools of oil if you even look at it the wrong way. On the opposite end of the spectrum is packaged, pre-shredded cheese, which is coated in stuff that prevents it from fully melting. Avoid it. Regular old Jack, Colby and/or cheddar grated by your own bare hands is the only way to go.3. Go wide, not highA mountain of nachos might look fun\u2014but at what cost?! Only the outermost layer gets topping love, while everything underneath is either naked and dry or sopping wet under the weight of it all.Nachos, like a California ranch-style home, should never be built more than two layers high. Spread the chips out wide on a rimmed baking sheet, evenly distribute cheese sauce and other hot toppings, like refried beans, then arrange just ONE (I mean it\u2014one!) more layer of chips, cheese, and hot toppings. Save the cold stuff like salsa, guacamole, and sour cream for the end. If that\u2019s not enough nacho for you, make two trays.4. Every chip should have something but not every chip should have everythingIf you\u2019re too careful about even topping distribution, dropping sour cream on every chip, your nachos will turn into a big, sloppy mess. I don\u2019t need every chip to have everything on it, but I want something on every chip. Toppings should be placed in little blobs throughout so that you can choose your own nacho adventure at every bite. Sometimes I don\u2019t want a bean and I just want cheese, other times I need a big plop of guacamole. I want to be  free to build each chip to satisfy my ever-changing needs. My nachos of choice consist of two layers of chips dressed with queso and are finished with pockets of finely chopped white onion, pinto beans, tomato salsa, cilantro, and sour cream thinned with lime juice.If you want to level up and get really crazy, warm the chips and the plates to extend the lifespan of your nachos. It's not a requirement, but I will count it towards your overall nacho score.Queso, Not From a JarYou could be totally hammered halfway through the Super Bowl and still make this queso. It\u2019s that easy.View RecipeRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
