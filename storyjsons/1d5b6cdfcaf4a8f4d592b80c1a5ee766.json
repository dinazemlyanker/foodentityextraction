Oreos Helped Us HealThey were a good choice for us then: a lot of calories packed into a bite full of sugar and fat.By Debi LewisMay 25, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Kissi UssukiFacebookTwitterEmailNearly two months after my daughter Sammi\u2019s surgery, we visited her pediatrician for a checkup. Sammi was eight and had been struggling to consume enough calories for years. Eating had been an excruciatingly slow task, and sometimes she refused certain textured foods altogether. Doctors had prescribed elimination diets and medications to treat possible acid reflux or protein intolerance. It turned out Sammi had a kink in her esophagus, causing food to get trapped after each swallow; an operation helped untangle it. Now, for the first time in her life, she was free to eat whatever she wanted.In the examining room, we got the post-surgery all-clear from the doctor. Before leaving she advised that Sammi put on a few pounds.\u201cHowever you want to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cLet it be junk food for now if that works.\u201dThat wasn\u2019t as easy as it sounded. Sammi\u2019s favorite foods were raspberries and watermelon not cupcakes or pizza. While most parents would be thrilled about these \u201chealthy\u201d preferences, fresh fruits weren\u2019t going to help Sammi put on those missing pounds. I knew I\u2019d need to relax my ideas about what constituted healthy food for a while. But I never imagined how embracing \u201cjunk\u201d might change our family for the better.While I wouldn\u2019t describe myself as a \u201cnatural foods only\u201d parent, I\u2019ve always encouraged healthy eating habits\u2014without vilifying carbs, fat, or even sugary cereals. In fact, the nutritional balance I\u2019d managed to create was partly thrust upon me by the exceedingly restrictive diets doctors had prescribed for Sammi over the years. We\u2019d always eaten whatever Sammi did, so I\u2019d learned to cook for four without dairy, soy, eggs, nuts, and wheat during one phase and without fat for another. Dishes I\u2019d learned to make out of necessity became family favorites: pan-seared brussels sprouts with garlic; crunchy tostadas with refried black beans; warm baked lentils with sweet potatoes. But cooking everything from scratch became exhausting. Any time I found a packaged or processed food that fit Sammi\u2019s needs, I was relieved. Though these weren\u2019t really adding much vitamin content, I learned that Sammi needed more than pure nutrition. When she couldn\u2019t eat whole wheat crackers or trail mix, plain potato chips made her feel less left out at snack time. When milk was forbidden, neon ice pops allowed her to enjoy the ice cream truck with friends at the beach. I didn\u2019t hesitate to include these snacks in her diet because they helped her feel less isolated.Now that she was done healing from surgery, calorie-dense, high-fat \u201cjunk foods\u201d were our best bet to help Sammi gain weight. I was willing, as always, to do whatever it took, but I worried about demonizing any food by calling it \u201cjunk.\u201d I\u2019d always taught my daughters that we ate both for fuel and joy. Anyone who saw my kitchen\u2014always stocked with beautiful local produce and salty tortilla chips\u2014knew balance was important to me.After Sammi\u2019s appointment with the pediatrician, a supermarket display of Oreos caught my eye. I\u2019d eaten them only a few times as a child; my mother seldom purchased store-bought cookies (they were to her, of course, \u201cjunk\u201d). As an enthusiastic baker, I rarely felt the need to buy them either. But something about these Oreos, with their bright blue packaging and pink-bordered font announcing twice the filling, piqued my curiosity. When I flipped the package over, I saw the nutritional information reflected a good choice for us then: a lot of calories packed into a bite full of sugar and fat.Sammi loved them. And within six months she had gained enough weight to look healthy. As she\u2019d learned to trust her newfound ease in swallowing, we\u2019d started adding other foods to her diet, like Thai noodle dishes and granola bars. But we still kept Oreos around; they had become a family staple. We mindlessly snacked on them whenever we breezed past the kitchen counter. I kept the pantry chock-full of blue packages; they became as usual a sight as the mountain of local fresh veggies I stocked in the fridge. I even packed the crunchy, creamy cookies in everyone\u2019s lunches; they were as tasty as the cookies I baked myself.Our Oreo tributes have transformed us from a family defined by foods we had to avoid into a family gleefully unencumbered by the many foods we enjoy.This routine lasted for three years. Then one day, after noticing the Oreos alongside our hoard of chips, sugary cereals, and Halloween candy, my husband asked gently: \u201cCould we just\u2026tone it down?\u201dIt may sound silly, but I couldn\u2019t help but feel embarrassed. Up until this point I\u2019d relished our new relaxed outlook on food. I\u2019d managed to mostly ignore the constant \u201chealthy food\u201d messaging around me: the stares from judgmental parents with their quinoa chips and natural almond butters, the women\u2019s magazines at the checkout counter, the fad diets. Sure, our family may have gone a little too far in our new direction. But it seemed the real problem wasn\u2019t the Oreos; it was our attitude about them.We called a family meeting and settled on a compromise. When a new Oreo flavor came out (as they do three or four times a year), we agreed to buy a package. If we were simply craving cookies, we would make them from scratch.Soon after we started filming our own Oreo \u201cunboxing\u201d videos, taste-testing and giggling through each review like playful connoisseurs. Is this delicious? How\u2019s the cr\u00e8me-to-cookie ratio? Does it taste like the flavor it advertises?We\u2019ve been posting our Oreo videos on Facebook for four years. I\u2019ve also often shared pictures of other things we love: our brussels sprouts; the rosemary and garlic braided challah topped with sea salt; the bright beet and carrot salad we swoon over every summer. No one has ever criticized these dishes, regardless of the volume of our intake. But plenty of people have expressed their opinions about our Oreos; some have even suggested we lacked self-control. I try to ignore them. Indulging in a few packages each year hardly counts as reckless behavior. Our Oreo tributes have transformed us from a family defined by foods we had to avoid into a family gleefully unencumbered by the many foods we enjoy.Last July we tried the new Team USA Oreos. We cheered on camera while ceremoniously opening the package and noted the delineation of the red, white, and blue frosting. We commenced our usual bit, treating the cookies at first with mock respect, then with real respect, and then, finally, with careful, genuine deliberation. Our verdict? They were okay. They didn\u2019t hold a candle to the juicy, musky sweetness of the Georgia freestone peaches we bought that same month. Did we eventually polish off the package anyway? Absolutely.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishFamilyRead MorecultureMaking Amends With Lean CuisineBy Mariella RudicultureWonder Bread, Government Cheese, and the Comfort of My Foster Mom\u2019s KitchenBy Nicole JohnsonRecipes you want to make.
