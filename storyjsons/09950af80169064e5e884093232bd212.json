Creamy lentils, crisp potatoes, and juicy tomatoes are a great texture combination, but the big punch is the flavor: an acidic dressing sweetened with honey and fiery harissa that converts the pleasant blandness of beans and potatoes into a zesty dish that just happens to be nutritious as well. Putting this one into heavy rotation.KimRoseThe West3/23/2021Very tasty and makes a lot of food. I didn\u2019t have harissa so I used an equal amount of salsa, it worked great.  Meticulous KJersey City 12/29/2020This was very tasty.  I couldn't find black lentils locally, so I used green.\n\nI also added the slow roasted harissa salmon recipe from this site, and it sang.\n\nI'll definitely make this again.daubie77Boston, MA5/26/2019Super duper good. I added homemade pickled onions to to give it some crunch and some acid.  \nThe recipe makes a ton of food. But I am sure you will enjoy [all of] it. AnonymousSeattle4/11/2019Easy, flavorful, and adaptable.  Doubled the vinaigrette recipe; used as a dressing for beets and  drizzled over grilled shrimp. Psychedelically colorful meal. AnonymousCalifornia3/11/2019Seriously, this was SO delicious! What an easy and uniquely flavored vegetarian meal to have! Really quick to prepare and we have tons of leftovers for lunch the next couple of days. Great combination of flavors. We added more harissa dressing to the roasted veggies and also added a bit of shredded cotija cheese on top and it was AMAZING. We're adding this to our regular rotation! Black lentils are so much better than green or red so make sure to use either black or green.AnonymousCincinnati2/27/2019This was SO GOOD and extremely easy. I am absolutely adding this into the rotation of favorite meals.\n\nI'll have to start putting Harissa paste in other stuff now because this was the first time I've used it.snafuquaMinneapolis2/24/2019Easy and flavor forward. I used mild harissa which worked well. Green lentils worked as well. decafpls2/14/2019Delicious!  I didn\u2019t have beluga lentils and used green.   Added carrots to sweet potatoes and was so yummy!!!SDMomSan Diego2/12/2019Phenomenal and super easy! Used white sweet potatoes from my CSA share and spicy Harrissa paste.
