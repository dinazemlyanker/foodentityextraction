I\u2019ve used the same app (SparkPeople) the entire time, which makes browsing back through my phases\u2014of paleo, raw, and too-many-tacos\u2014both convenient and insightful. The app makes tracking macronutrients (carbs, fat, protein) simple, and it allows me to monitor more specific ingredients like fiber, sugar, or iron. (You can also track exercise and chat with other members in a community feed, but I\u2019ve never used those functions.)Ten years of tracking makes me feel old, and compulsive, but also proud. Being the health-geek that I am, self-study is a source of endless fascination, inspiration, and exploration. It was especially interesting to track my transition from protein-at-every-meal to totally being plant-based, for example.The benefits of keeping a food journalFor the less data-enthusiastic, here\u2019s some journaling motivation: simply keeping a food log can double a person's weight loss, if that's your goal. It's good for other things too:Food journaling can help you understand what\u2019s pissing off your digestion, disrupting your sleep, or causing those afternoon energy crashes. The act of writing down what we eat and drink\u2014and even just knowing that we\u2019ll be tracking the trail mix\u2014makes us more mindful of our consumption. It\u2019s an excellent way to uncover invaluable details about our relationship with food, and to remind ourselves what we otherwise mindlessly munched on today. (I can\u2019t count the number of times my clients have returned after a week of meal tracking with a revelation (like, I am totally addicted to almonds!) that is then theirs to choose to change, or keep.)This allows for accountability, but on your own terms. For some, a buddy-system is additionally helpful, so consider comparing notes with a friend. For others, the idea of sharing is a no-go, in which case you don\u2019t have to show your diary to anyone, unless you\u2019re my client.Great tools for journalingThe downside is that food journaling is another thing to do every day. But, there are apps for that. Obviously, I would recommend SparkPeople; it\u2019s been so convenient for me over the last decade that I\u2019ve never wanted to switch. Depending on your goals and aesthetic standards, there are a ton to choose from. MyFitnessPal and LoseIt are popular, and some newer apps on the market now positioned as macro-trackers are also great (e.g. Fitocracy Macros).The benefit of tracking digitally is that you can automate things (like saving meals or favorite foods) and save a lot of time. But they can be too obsessive for some. If you\u2019d rather not track calories but still want to glean some broad-stroke insights about your intake, good old-fashioned paper is great, or a Google Doc, which I like because it\u2019s accessible any time.Tracking can be quick, too. My daily entries now take less than a minute to enter. Beginning is the biggest time-investment, but over time, and especially with apps, it gets a lot easier.Some Tips Before You Get Started\u2013 Be honest! Not writing it down is just denial. (But if you do fib, you\u2019re not alone: we tend to underestimate our calorie intake by up to 40%.)\u2013 Get to know serving sizes. For example: Three ounces of protein is as big as a deck of cards; a teaspoon is dice-sized, and a ping-pong ball-sized \u201cscoop\u201d of anything is two tablespoons.\u2013 It\u2019s not all about the calories. Try tracking other things you care about or are working on, like sugar intake, energy fluctuations, or whether eating less protein actually makes you feel better. Tracking progress can be really motivating, in the same way that running a faster mile or lifting a heavier weight can be.\u2013 Consider recording how you feel, too. This ensures that it\u2019s not just about calories (because it\u2019s not!) but a more holistic look at a relationship with food. This is my favorite part about my clients\u2019 diet tracking. We learn so much there. Like, your gluten-free bread might actually be causing that bloat. Avocados make you feel more full than meat. Breakfast is okay to skip because you\u2019d rather have your smoothie in the afternoon when you\u2019re in the mood for a treat.\u2013 Stay the course and know that it\u2019s a new habit, harder to start than to maintain.The Hard Parts\u2013 Finding time in our busy schedules is hard when you want to start food journaling. If you\u2019re the calendar-type, set reminders to record food a few times a day. Later on, you won\u2019t need them. (Some apps have them built in.) For the schedule-averse try putting sticky-note reminders in your kitchen, at your desk, or wherever you tend to eat.\u2013 Don\u2019t get caught up in the measurement details. It\u2019s okay to estimate. If you\u2019re not sure how many ounces something is, or what exactly is in the juicery\u2019s smoothie, taking your best guess is allowed. So is asking your server what\u2019s in what you\u2019re ordering, which I do all over town.\u2013 Avoid obsession by not looking at your data until the end of the day or even weekly. Like with weighing yourself, daily fluctuations will occur.\u2013 I\u2019d also suggest tracking your food as you\u2019re eating it or immediately afterward. Waiting until the end of the day guarantees missed meals or food amnesia (which is actually a thing).Let's Do ThisKnow that there\u2019s no best time to start. But, if you need some suggestions: Monday, the first-of-the-month, or right now are all great options. Give yourself a week to decide on a tracking method and how long you\u2019ll track for (even if it\u2019s just two weeks). Circle it in the calendar, mentally commit, then go! I guarantee you\u2019ll learn something new about yourself.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishFeel Good Food PlanRead MorecookingThis Recipe Will Turn All You Dinner Frittata Skeptics Into Total ConvertsBy Rachel KartenRecipes you want to make.
