Slice each half into 3 lengthwise wedges.Step 3Peel 6 garlic cloves and thinly slice.Step 4Slice 3 rolls lengthwise without cutting all the way through (so 2 sides remain attached).Step 5Place 2 lb. sausages in a large straight-sided skillet and cover with cold water just until sausages are submerged.

Stir to combine, then increase heat to medium-high. Cover and cook, uncovering to stir occasionally, until peppers are tender, 10\u201315 minutes.Step 8Create a clearing in the middle of the pot and add 2 Tbsp. tomato paste. Stir paste until darkened in color and is sticking to bottom of pot, about 3 minutes.Step 9Add \u2153 cup vinegar and stir to dissolve paste and combine with peppers and onions.

Season with more salt and pepper.Step 10Meanwhile, slice sausages in half lengthwise.Step 11Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in reserved skillet over medium-high.

Cut sandwiches in half crosswise and serve.How would you rate Sausage, Peppers, and Onions Subs?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (5)Back to TopTriangleI\u2019m really here to comment on \u201cHow to Cook Sausage.\u201d I followed the directions and, lo and behold, when I sliced them in half to brown them, they were DEFINITELY still nearly raw!!! The article/directions specifically said that they would be completely cooked??? Yechhhhhh!!!Normando TicoSan Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica9/3/2021Great recipe! I would personally suggest using less of the tomato paste (~1 heaping tbsp) and subbing red wine vinegar for straight red wine. My personal philosophy - if it drinks well it will eat well, hence using red wine instead. The 1 start review person has a good point in critiquing the recipe for being too vinegary, but it's an easy fix and that's how I would adjust. BTW, you simmer the sausage so that they don't fall apart when you slice. Just be sure to keep an eye on them so they don't overcook. They won't dry out if you handle with love and care! dfrank00New York City 12/29/2019I really liked this recipe! The only issue I had was in roasting the peppers. The quantity is so large that when I cooked it all in my dutch oven (which is not small) the pot was so overcrowded that all the vegetables began to sweat and I had a significant amount of liquid in the bottom. This meant I couldn't really brown the tomato paste and deglaze with the red wine vinegar. Tastewise, though, this didn't cause any significant issues.AnonymousColumbia, SC10/17/2019I usually love making recipes from Bon Appetit! regardless of how long they might take and/or having to purchase ingredients that I don't often use.  However, this recipe was disappointing.  The addition of the tomato paste and red vinegar impart such an acidic aftertaste to what would have been a mild, sweet pepper and onion mixture that typically complements the subtle fennel seed spice of the Italian Sausage.  And simmering, slicing and frying the sausage only dried it out.  I am not a picky person but I just didn't want to waste my Italian rolls on this one.
