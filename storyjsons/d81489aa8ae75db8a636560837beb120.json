In this case the shrimp cook so quickly that it\u2019s better to pan-fry them separately and combine with the rice at the very end. Senior food editor Andy Baraghani recommends using the highest quality basmati rice you can find (Andy loves extra long sella basmati rice from Mihan) for a perfectly fluffy and fragrant pilaf.Ingredients4 Servings\u00bccup plus 2 Tbsp. ghee or vegetable oil2medium red onions, thinly sliced1\u00bdtsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more4whole dried chiles de \u00e1rbol or 1 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes2Tbsp. double-concentrated tomato paste4tsp. ground coriander, divided2tsp. freshly ground black pepper, divided1tsp. ground turmeric, divided1\u00bdcups basmati rice, rinsed until water runs clear1lb. large shrimp, peeled, deveined3garlic cloves, finely grated2tsp. finely grated ginger\u00bdcup coarsely chopped cilantro, dill, or mintLime wedges (for serving)PreparationStep 1Melt \u00bc cup ghee in a medium pot over medium heat. Add onions, season with salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until deeply golden brown and starting to look lacy (this will take some time!), 15\u201320 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer half of the onions to a plate and set aside for serving.Step 2Add chiles de \u00e1rbol, tomato paste, 2 tsp. coriander, 1 tsp. pepper, and \u00bd tsp. turmeric to onions still in pot. Cook, stirring often, until tomato paste darkens slightly, about 3 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring, until each grain is well coated, about 30 seconds. Add 1\u00bd tsp. salt, pour in 2\u00bc cups water, and give mixture a stir to prevent any grains from sticking to bottom of pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and cover pot. Let rice cook until water is completely absorbed and rice is tender, 16\u201318 minutes. Remove pot from heat and let rice sit (still covered) 15 minutes.Step 3While the rice is resting, toss shrimp with garlic, ginger, remaining 2 tsp. coriander, 1 tsp. pepper, and \u00bd tsp. turmeric in a medium bowl. Season with salt and toss again.Step 4Five minutes before rice is done resting, melt remaining 2 Tbsp. ghee in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp in a single layer and cook until lightly charred around the edges, about 1 minute per side. Remove from heat.Step 5Uncover rice and fluff with a fork. Add shrimp and cilantro and gently fold in until evenly distributed. Transfer pilaf to a platter and top with reserved crispy onions. Serve pilaf with lime wedges for squeezing over.How would you rate Spicy Shrimp Pilaf?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (12)Back to TopTriangleI love this recipe! Didn\u2019t have any issues with the measurements or instructions and it turned out great. We\u2019ve made it several times now and can\u2019t wait to make it again. PelmenPortland, Oregon9/1/2021Terrible recipe.. rice/water proportions and times are not accurate at all. What a waste of time and ingredients on this.Camila 8/31/2021Delicious! A perfect date-night-in meal. Definitely agree with other reviewers that you should allow plenty of time for the onions or make them ahead. Claire7/3/2021Delicious and pretty easy, though time consuming because of one step.  It took me 50 minutes to get my onions to the right point.  They still weren't crispy, but were dark golden and sweet.  Next time, rather than use the medium pot, I'd do them in a larger pan to get more cooking area on them - or just make them in advance.  Wouldn't have been a problem but for the fact that some of them have to cook with the rice too.  This was also great as leftovers.  My young son wanted thirds!LBinTXFort Worth, TX5/25/2021I really enjoyed this! It took longer than I anticipated but that was more due to my poor planning. The sweetness of the onions mixed with the crispiness of some of the rice, yum! I can't think of any changes I'd make. Overall, this was a great dinner and I'll likely make it again. Camille Chicago, IL5/5/2021We made this and it was fabulous.  We halved the coriander.  I was surprised to see ANY reviews less than 5 stars.  Maybe the full amount of coriander is just too strong.  We shared this recipe with some friends and all will make it again.  fabulous!Northern California4/14/2021This recipe is a disaster, and I've spent a year in lockdown making other Bon Appetite recipes without problem. The rice was totally undercooked, forcing me to add more water, so I had porridge at the end.William HSeattle, WA4/13/2021This was a great recipe and extremely simple. I have a huge bag of chiles that I need to find more recipes for now!MckenzieMinnesota4/2/2021I made a couple small revisions but it was delicious and aromatic and everyone loved it. \nI added a touch of garam masala to the spice mix and threw some frozen peas in about a couple minutes before the rice was to stop cooking.   I also cooked the shrimp like cooks illustrated where you start in a cold pan and barely cook. \nIt was perfect.  You can also tweak the spices and veg to make it like any other cuisine you'd like. This one is a keeper.  GK3/29/2021This was delicious.  I made it exactly as written.  My onions came out more caramelized than crispy, ( perhaps they needed to cook longer), but still added wonderful flavor.    Instead of adding the shrimp to the rice, I added the rice to the shrimp to capture more of the garlic/ginger flavor from the shrimp pan.   This was easy and pretty quick.  Definitely a keeper. Nancy Mc3/28/2021We\u2019ve come a long way since 1971. ChrisHarrisburg, PA3/27/2021Ginger was overpowering. Coriander burnt pretty quickly when I added over the onions. My boyfriend didn\u2019t finish his, which is a pretty good indication that this wasn\u2019t spectacular. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d make this again without some major tweaks.
