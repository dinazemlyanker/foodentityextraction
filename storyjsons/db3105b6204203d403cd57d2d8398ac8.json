See our past recommendations here!I\u2019m a diehard jerky fan. If J-14 magazine made posters of jerky, my childhood bedroom would have been plastered with them.  I\u2019ve even professed my love for the salty snack on this very site. So when a mysterious bag of *whispers* Pan\u2019s mushroom jerky showed up on our office  snack table, I was skeptical. Could it replicate the chew of meat jerky? Would it have that terrible fake smoke flavor that plagues most faux-jerkies? Did I really want to eat a handful of mushrooms? Then I tried it. And my jerky-loving life was changed forever.Pan\u2019s Mushroom Jerky was started by Michael Pan after visiting his extended family in Malaysia and trying their extremely snackable dried mushrooms. When he returned home to Portland, Oregon, he brought the recipe with him: a minimal mix of organic dried shiitake mushrooms, water, avocado oil, coconut sugar, salt, and chia seeds.While you\u2019ll never be confused if you\u2019re eating mushroom or pork, there is a distinct jerky quality to the snack that satisfies that same craving. The little nuggets of mushrooms are chewy and meaty. The salty umami that shiitakes naturally have comes through. Most importantly, it passes my very important jerky test: Can I finish an entire bag in one sitting? \u2014 Rachel Karten, associate director of social mediaBuy it: Pan's Mushroom Jerky, $7.50All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
