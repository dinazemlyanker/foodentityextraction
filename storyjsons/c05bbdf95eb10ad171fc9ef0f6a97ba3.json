The caption that accompanies the joyous video is classic Whitney, who brims with vulnerability and relatable wisdom. \u201c[I\u2019m] taking a quick moment to celebrate some big + small wins, and connecting to my body feels like an active rebuke of those heavy feelings which are continuously trying to swallow me whole,\u201d they write.Whitney is an author, facilitator, and sensualist whose Instagram platform offers insight and guidance around sexual well-being. The term Sexuality Doula is one Whitney uses to describe their line of work, which broadly involves creating space and companionship for people experiencing sexual shame, trauma, or repression. Doulas provide guidance through other major life stages, like birth and death, and Whitney figured sex shouldn\u2019t be any different. Their goal is to help people release the effects of past hurt and negative self-perceptions by offering liberatory mind and body practices.Sexual liberation, though, is not the same as sex therapy: Whereas sex therapy is typically about resolving issues in the bedroom, sexual liberation often happens outside of it. The path is holistic, involving lifelong spiritual and emotional work that has to do with understanding the relationship between all of the body\u2019s experiences. Some of Whitney\u2019s clients have sought to heal wounds from traumatic experiences, like harassment or assault. For others, healing has meant developing an appreciation for their own bodies and eroticism, or unpacking social commentary about \u201ccorrect\u201d expressions of gender. For many femme people, liberation has been unlearning the message that someone else\u2019s orgasm matters more than your own.To make their guidance more accessible, Whitney created the sensual selfie, an Instagram photo sharing \u201cchallenge\u201d that encourages publicly celebrating one\u2019s body, and sensual dance meditation, a movement practice for releasing energy and navigating complex emotions. Here\u2019s what else Whitney recommends:Show up for yourself first.Whitney recommends setting up a morning routine that awakens your physical body, grounds your mind and spirit in your body, and sets an intention for the day. For them, that looks like starting the day with water or tea, doing their skin-care routine, sitting at their ancestral altar, pulling a couple of tarot cards, and writing in their journal. \u201cThese rituals provide ways for me to connect to myself, connect to my voice, and connect to my story, because it\u2019s very easy for me to take on the energies and the issues of the people that I am speaking to in my work,\u201d Whitney explains.Understand that there is no timeline for healing.\u201cAs you get deeper into your healing, there\u2019s more to reconcile with,\u201d Whitney explains. \u201cI think each layer that we excavate can help inform the next layer that we get to, but it\u2019s really important that folks understand that our bodies are not clocks, we cannot\u2014and we should not\u2014treat them as though they are machines.\u201d Whitney wants people to accept that sexual healing is lifelong work; don\u2019t chastise yourself if you feel you\u2019ve stumbled or regressed in some way. Work on silencing inner voices that give negative feedback, as those are the voices that want to punish, not liberate.Practice body curiosity.Sexual liberation is oftentimes about working to heal the harms incurred from systems of oppression, including white supremacy, the gender binary, and heteronormativity. Whitney recommends starting with questions: How do you experience your own body? What does that experience look like if you try to quiet the messages that you have to be a certain way? If you were to ask your body which pronouns it aligns with, what would they be? \u201cThe more that I asked myself those questions, the more I got clear about what made sense for me,\u201d Whitney says about their decision to come out as nonbinary. \u201cMemories started to come through where I can remember being a kid; that I wasn\u2019t a girl, that I wasn\u2019t a boy. I was just a being that was enjoying life and playing and feeling fully in the present moment.\u201dWrite a letter to your inner child.Our adult selves are inextricable from our child selves, Whitney says: \u201cI know that so much of my own healing stems from the younger version of me who has been harmed, who wasn\u2019t seen or heard or validated, who was othered and ostracized and told that she wasn\u2019t good enough.\u201d Addressing and healing pain or trauma that comes up in our adult lives can start with writing a letter to your child self. Whitney says that could consist of a love letter or even an apology.For BIPOC, set boundaries with whiteness.Our sexual selves respond to the world around us. If we\u2019re constantly taking in interpersonal and structural forms of homophobia, racism, and sexism, our sexual, emotional, mental, and physical health will reflect that, Whitney says. They limit whiteness where they can, in their circle of friends and by curating an Instagram feed of predominantly BIPOC creators. \u201cIt\u2019s been really difficult, because this world operates and was built on white supremacy,\u201d Whitney explains. \u201cBut I am proud of myself that I\u2019ve created for myself this kind of safe haven where I\u2019m limiting people\u2019s access to me; it\u2019s been very good for my mental health.\u201dTrust in your cravings.Sexual liberation demands that we center and embrace our own pleasure. This is important, Whitney says, because for most of our lives we\u2019re taught that pleasures are \u201cguilty\u201d or that offering our bodies what they\u2019re asking for is indulgent. Instead, they recommend letting your body guide your diet. \u201cI would invite people to linger over what they see in the aisles and ask, \u2018Do I have a craving for that?\u2019\u201d Whitney says. \u201cOr asking, \u2018Hey body, what are you craving right now?\u2019\u201dRelease built-up energy in your body.Whitney recommends movement as a path to releasing negative energy and grounding oneself. They say that our emotions, like stress, fear, or shame, build up in our bodies and prevent us from being present, experiencing pleasure, or connecting with ourselves and others sexually. They recommend starting with a playful shimmy or a sensual dance meditation.Explore Bon App\u00e9titSelf CareHealthyishRead MoreLifestyleThese 5 Things in My \u201cJoy Toolbox\u201d Are Getting Me Through WinterBy Martine ThompsonRecipes you want to make.
