Like so many others, I haven\u2019t thrown a dinner party on this scale in years. And while I might be a little rusty on the party-planning front, here are a few ways I\u2019m planning on making the evening extra special:Who needs a turkey?I actually happen to be one of the four people alive who actually LOVE turkey, especially when it\u2019s spiced and glazed. But in a year when everything has felt far from ordinary, it feels right to bring something different to the table. (Or, at least, to the Friendsgiving table. You try telling my mother you want to make a duck for Thanksgiving this year.) I\u2019m covering the mains at my Friendsgiving\u2014I\u2019m thinking of this home-cook-friendly take on Peking duck paired with fresh moo shu wrappers from Kristina Cho\u2019s incredible new book Mooncakes & Milk Bread, plus the Palestinian sumac roast chicken called musakhan.Fire up the Google spreadsheetI sent out a signup sheet to all our guests this week by making a simple Google spreadsheet. I listed the dishes I\u2019m planning to make and left places for people to write in their name, what they\u2019re bringing, any dietary restrictions they have, and whether or not they\u2019re also planning to bring a beverage, which may have been a slightly passive aggressive way of saying, All the wine, please. So far friends have signed up to bring everything from this mushroom Wellington(!) to pumpkin pie. I\u2019m already hungry.Think outside the cheese plateI will always hard-pass on the bland wedges of generic Brie in favor of an appetizer that\u2019s as festive as it is appetite-whetting. I also appreciate an app that takes very little time to put together, which is why this year I\u2019m planning on pan-frying and steaming some Fly By Jing dumplings, opening a jar of Zhong Sauce, and calling it a day. I doubt anyone is going to miss the cheese. Bonus: Preparing dumplings is simple enough that if I\u2019m busy with other things, I can delegate it to a friend without having my control-freak instincts kick in...too much.Ask people to BYOD and BYOTAnd by D and T I mean dishes and take-out containers. Extra serving vessels and utensils, wine glasses, a giant cooler or ice bucket for drinks\u2014if you don\u2019t have them, ask friends to bring them. The take-out containers are for everyone to pack up the leftovers of their choice at the end of the night.Say yes to help...Some of my best dinner party memories are from nights when I was running behind schedule and needed to pull in a few extra hands to get everything on the table. If there\u2019s a simple prep task that can be done easily (and not too messily) by the masses\u2014picking herbs, spinning salad greens, arranging flowers and lighting the candles\u2014put them to work. If they\u2019re good friends, they\u2019ll be more than happy to pitch in....including the dishesAfter the clock strikes 12 and I\u2019m a pumpkin on my nth glass of wine, my love language is someone else doing the dishes (or loading the dishwasher). I bet it might be yours too\u2014you\u2019ve earned it.Nothing but the Hits:Photo by Marcus Nilsson, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiCheesy Cabbage GratinSimple Is Best DressingRice Pilaf With Lemony Brown-Butter MushroomsBitter Greens With Cranberry DressingCranberry-Lime PieRoasted Brussels Sprouts With Gochujang Brown ButterExplore Bon App\u00e9titWhat's Chaey Cooking?cookingRecipes you want to make.
