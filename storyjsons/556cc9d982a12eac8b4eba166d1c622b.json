First runner-up was served to me in a local brewpub here in Portland, Oregon - they had a Vadouvan Curry treatment and were heavenly - leading to an education for me on Vadouvan curry, but that's another story. THESE had - for me - the perfect balance between tangy (vineger /acid), spicy, and sweet.  Kind of like Chicken Marbella, if you've ever had that. (If not, you should. A now-legendary sweet / tangy recipe.) \nKEEPER! Ken P PDXPortland, OR1/19/2022These were the best I\u2019ve ever had better than a restaurant that we went to that serve them absolutely delicious and I\u2019m recommending it to my family! Also I am a born-again Christian and I wanted to ask if you know Jesus Christ as your savior the Bible says believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and they shall be saved and thy house. Acts 16:31 but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God to them that believe on his name. John 112Happy Virginia 1/17/2022This recipe is truly delightful. I made two pounds of Brussel sprouts and the sauce was still too much, but it\u2019s nice to have some leftover sauce.\nI added pancetta, truly delicious Anonymous12/27/2021This recipe made the best Brussels sprouts I\u2019ve ever tasted. And they are so easy to prepare!AnonymousThe Adirondacks 12/26/2021Loved the way of cooking the sprouts - they did come out crispier than usual. But you need about half the amount of the glaze, Wasn't a huge fan of this one.AnonymousOakland, CA11/26/2021Love it. I tried numerous recipes before sticking with this one. It's a true crowd-pleaser\n\nI don't usually use all the glaze and as a variant, bacon makes it even better.DenverChefDenver, CO11/26/2021these brussels sprouts are easy enough for everyday and delicious enough to wow a crowd at a dinner party or holiday gatheringranalos angeles11/25/2021This recipe was a hit at Thanksgiving. It's more tangy than sweet, if you're worried about that. For those looking to bring it somewhere, I  made the glaze ahead of time and kept it relatively warm in a coozy/jar combo, reheated the sprouts when it was time to eat, and topped with the glaze/scallions/zest at the last. The glaze was never super thick. I don't know if that was on me or just the way it is, but the sprouts were tasty regardless.AnonymousChicago11/21/2021I love the honey and acid to balance the dish. Adding scallions is genius. Maybe some fresh thyme to the it with some turkey too.John GKennesaw, GA11/10/2021I was a sceptic, esp. given how runny the glaze was initially, but it is as delicious as other reviewers have claimed. I've been convinced that Brussels sprouts should become a more regular feature of the table rather than just making a one-off appearance at Christmas.AnonymousLondon, UK12/29/2020Brussels looked perfect coming out of the oven but the glaze turned them soggy immediately.  Flavor was great but texture was a mess.  I think the problem was the glaze was way too hot, I'd cranked the heat pretty high to get it to reduce into a more glazy consistency and it never would.  then when i poured onto the brussels it just overcooked them.  noticed that the leftover glaze (recipe makes about 2x what you need) after it had cooled a bit was the right consistency. next time will try making the glaze well ahead and just reheating lightly while sprouts are roasting.  The flavors are right so worth a few experiments to get this one downSeamusdallas12/26/2020Hands down my favorite Brussels sprouts recipe. They\u2019re addictive with the perfect balance of flavors AnonymousAustin, TX12/15/2020This is the recipe to make a Brussels lover out of a Brussels hater. I have brought it to every Friendsgiving/Thanksgiving/Christmas the last couple of years and it always gets RAVE reviews, and requested again. I\u2019ll never even think about making a different Brussels sprouts recipe because this one is so perfect. Thanks, Molly!AnonymousColumbus11/26/2020I brought this dish to a potluck full of meat eaters and it ended up being one of the first empty plates of the night. A friend of mine told me that this was the dish to make her love brussels sprouts, which was a big win :) The kick of vinegar + chile is a fantastic way to perk up what would otherwise be a pretty mellow vegetable dish, would happily make again!JessSt. John's, NL11/23/2020I've made this several times now, and it always delivers a punch of very well integrated flavors.  The sweet and sour glaze is perfect with the brussels sprouts.  I have added bacon to this recipe and it's always delicious.  Also, I've subbed maple syrup too, and it is terrific as well.
