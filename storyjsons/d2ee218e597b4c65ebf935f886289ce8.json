We like to pair it with a sauce with a kick, but for a milder taste, de-seed your chiles before chopping.Ingredients8\u201310 servings6garlic cloves, finely grated\u00becup plus 3 Tbsp. sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar3lb. skirt steak, cut into 5\" piecesKosher salt1Tbsp. plus 2 tsp. sugar1\u00bccups extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for grill2large bunches scallions (about 30 scallions)2Fresno chiles, seeds removed if desired, finely choppedPreparationStep 1Whisk together garlic and \u00be cup vinegar in a large bowl.

Loved the scallions but next time I would let the meat marinate longer.  tomaMichigan 5/10/2021This was amazing!! I agree with the other comments below, use 1/4 cup of olive oil. For the salsa verde I used 2 Tbsp red wine vinegar + 1 Tbsp rice wine vinegar.\n\nI made it for a dinner party, and was nervous because I did not test out the recipe in advance. It was absolutely DELICIOUS!!! This is the perfect party steak. \nAnonymousNew York8/1/2020Is there a video for this Recipe? AnonymousNew York 8/10/2019Enjoyed this. Couple of things. ... never found a bunch of scallions that numbered 15, and we go through a lot of scallions. Red wine vinegar was a bit heavy for our taste; substituted rice wine vinegar with a splash of red wine and cut the sugar in half. AnonymousPhoenix7/17/2019We've made this twice and it was delicious. But agreeing with the below--I didn't use the indicated amount of oil--WAY too much in my view. Delicious!AbbygorLos Angeles7/15/2019Great recipe, for flank steak as well! I also used less olive oil, probably around 1/3c and it was fine. I would grind up the sauce next time, either in a food processor or mortar and pestle.AnonymousOregon7/8/2019Is the amount 1\u00bc cups extra-virgin olive oil really that much? Please advise asap \nAnonymousTN7/2/2019Dear lord this steak could convert a vegan. SO SO GOOD! ilacosseMinnesota6/27/2019This was very good! I   served it with flour tortillas and beans. That said, the thought of dumping over a cup of olive oil into the salsa and then that over the meat seemed nuts. Is that a typo? I  used 1/2 cup olive oil and that was more than sufficient. The general rule of thumb when cooking with peppers is the whatever the recipe calls for, they won't have it at your supermarket. I   subbed serrano peppers for Fresno. It was just fine!AnonymousLos Angeles6/23/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titSteakBeefMeatScallionOnionVegetableSpringSummerQuickEasyWeeknight Meals5 Ingredients or FewerMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreeGrillingFourth Of JulyMemorial DayLabor DayDinnerRecipes you want to make.
