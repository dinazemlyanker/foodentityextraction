While some izakaya skew fancy and others grungy, Shirube is an egalitarian affair where the tired salarymen and the local cool kids can all take off their shoes and down a beer. It\u2019s got an unpretentious menu full of crowd favorites, plus a rambunctious, lively atmosphere for anyone who finds Tokyo too quiet.ORDER THE: shime saba, marinated mackerel fillet that the staff torches at your table; the karaage (Japanese fried chicken); the stewy fishcake and egg oden; and the yakisoba omelet, which is a helping of stir-fried noodles topped with an omelet that is a couple inches thick and doused in a mayo-based sauce.Like any Japanese meal, the finale is everything. The end-of-meal offerings change every now and then, but fried rice is always on the menu. Miso soup, which comes after the main dishes in Japan, is complimentary. To bring it home, order the vanilla ice cream, which comes topped with kinako (a sweet, nutty powder made from toasted soy) and kuromitsu (sugar syrup made from unrefined muscovado).THE VIBE IS: loud and convivial, and the seating is old-fashioned. Find a place on the floor and watch the activity in the large open kitchen as you wait on your order to come out. Don\u2019t worry: The servers will scuttle around you.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open daily from 5:30 p.m. to midnight. The regular menu is in English and Japanese, but the specials are Japanese only. Some English is spoken by the staff, but it\u2019s not a guarantee. Reservations are recommended for groups over four, but smaller parties can usually walk in. The nearest subway station is Shimokitazawa.Photo by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneThe mackerel fillet gets torched table-side.\nPhoto by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneTake off your shoes and order a beer.\nBy Kee Byung-keunExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
