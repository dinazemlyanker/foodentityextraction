The island had been wiped out by the historic 1900 storm, a hurricane that killed thousands and flattened the landscape. One of my mom\u2019s favorite bedtime stories was telling us about the nuns at an orphanage who tied the kids together to keep track of them in the storm\u2014only to have them drown because of it. Every time she told the story the number of orphans grew. So this is the place, and the people, I come from.We\u2019ve scattered the ashes of so many family members in the Gulf that now I can\u2019t swim in those brown salty waters without thinking, Mom? You out here? And a hermit crab will bite my toe, saying, Naw, lady, she was crawfish food a decade ago. There are other things in this water to fear.In the decades after the Great Storm, the island rebuilt and a two-story restaurant called The Original Mexican Caf\u00e9 opened. The Original has blue-green siding and a white sign anchored with two Coca-Cola logos. Another sign points to the door and reads, \u201cThe owner eats here!\u201d (which is true). It\u2019s one of the two oldest restaurants on the island; a temple of Tex-Mex.At the Original you always order the chicken mole enchiladas. Mole can get too chocolaty if the cook is heavy-handed, but here it\u2019s in perfect balance with smoky ancho chiles, served with a side of brothy charro beans and red-stained rice. Hurricanes have come and gone since\u2014so have those we loved and thought we couldn\u2019t live without\u2014but that recipe stays the same and somehow we go on living. For my family the Original\u2019s enchiladas are a dish we return to in times of celebration or gathering, like that Thanksgiving green bean casserole recipe you\u2019ll never tweak a teaspoon of. It allows time to stand still for once. We\u2019re the ones changing.Gale-force grief fools you into thinking no one else has ever felt this way. You are the island, somehow existing below sea level.\u00a0We ate at the Original after seasoning the beach with my mom, and even on that weird day I was relieved to be there. If you\u2019ve never had chili con queso at a funeral, I can\u2019t recommend it enough. Baskets of warm tortilla chips were staggered along tables filled with family flattened by this other kind of hurricane. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe it,\u201d said my grandpa. \u201cI keep expecting her to walk through the door.\u201d Instead, a server appeared with more chips.Gale-force grief fools you into thinking no one else has ever felt this way. You are the island, somehow existing below sea level. Writing about it is overwrought (oof, these hurricane metaphors) and the takeaways are always the same: Live life to the fullest; go on a lot of vacations; get the motorcycle license. That\u2019s all great but kinda expensive, so I prefer to revel in the smallest, most boring moments. I love a good nap.When I wake up I\u2019m excited and grateful to be conveniently alive. And with standards for amusement that low, everything else in my day seems even more amazing. Which is how I cope with knowing that it could all come crashing down at any moment. Last December I was thrilled to be buying a four-pack of a strawberry-banana spiked smoothie seltzer called Smooj for a Christmas Eve cocktail when I got the text that my grandpa had been hospitalized with COVID-19. If you want to be reminded of how short, sweet, and stupid life is, have a Smooj. (It\u2019s delicious.)What happens when you\u2019re 91 and have COVID is you die. I wanted my grandpa to pass in his red flannel pajama pants and recliner watching Masterpiece Theater, but death doesn\u2019t show up at your doorstep with a laminated menu. At the time, all the politicians and television preachers were saying stuff like, \u201cThere\u2019s going to be an empty seat at the [insert holiday here] table this year,\u201d which drove me nuts. As if I need to be reminded by a shell-haired pundit that I\u2019m missing someone so badly I have recurring dreams about losing my limbs. I get how metaphors work.When you\u2019re grieving, certain times of year that used to be all joy and presents and enchiladas get spiked with sadness. For me, the entire month of July, the holidays, the birthday anniversaries now meaningless and the death anniversaries now meaningful. All this sadness can threaten to take away from your having a good time. My advice: Don\u2019t let it.On Thanksgiving I make sure to do whatever the hell I want. Are enough people doing this? Duck legs in place of turkey, hazelnut flan instead of pumpkin pie, staying home instead of nightmare traveling. I got The Original\u2019s recipe (from the owner himself, thanks Nicky!), so mole enchiladas are sounding good. I hope the ghosts at the table don\u2019t mind, but there\u2019s going to be a shrimp cocktail course.When I visited my grandma after Grandpa died, she was outside her apartment door with a rosary in one hand and a handful of peanuts in the other, luring a neighborhood squirrel over and apparently praying for its soul. This lady. She got to say goodbye to Grandpa in the hospital as long as her 90-pound COVID-resistant frame was covered head to toe in PPE. He\u2019d been able to say, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She told me it meant he was fine with dying. Then she added, \u201cYou know, he always loved sleeping,\u201d and I cracked up, crying and laughing.Make the recipe:Chicken Mole EnchiladasThis streamlined approach to making mole cuts down on ingredients without sacrificing flavor for a rich, velvety sauce that\u2019s layered under crispy-gooey cheese.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titEnchiladasMoleTex-MexRead MorecultureTwo Strangers With a Stunningly Intimate Connection Walk Into a Restaurant...By Dani ShapirocultureI Thought Beef Stroganoff Was For Fancy People, Until I Made It My OwnBy Beth NguyenRecipes you want to make.
