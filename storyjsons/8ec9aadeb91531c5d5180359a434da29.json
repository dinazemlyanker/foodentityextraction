In Molly\u2019s Got Thoughts, she\u2019ll dive deep into some of her favorite dishes and, along the way, drop looooots of knowledge for how you can achieve the best version yet. Today: how to make Caesar salad.If there\u2019s one thing I know with certainty, it\u2019s that Cae Sal reigns supreme in the salad kingdom. It is my one true love (aside from Tuna\u2014and no, I\u2019m not talking about the kind that comes out of the ocean and is usually packed in cans; I\u2019m talking about the extra-long, teeny-tiny weenie who I live with.) For goodness sake, I even own a pair of customized Nikes that say \u201cCae\u201d on one tongue and \u201cSal\u201d on the other! True story!To me, a Caesar salad is the platonic ideal of a salad\u2014I hold few things in the world in higher esteem. It can easily serve as the main event, but it\u2019s just as delightful as a side. It prominently features greens, which make me feel virtuous, but those greens get covered in mayonnaise, which makes me feel full. There are carbs in the form of croutons, which make me feel happy, and there is always an abundance of parm which is, by my account, the king of cheeses and therefore welcome on my plate at all times.When done right, it\u2019s one of life\u2019s greatest pleasures. But when done wrong, it\u2019s a disappointment, a bowl of lost potential. Since many of us have a  helluva lot more time on our hands these days and exactly nowhere to go, it seems like the perfect opportunity to commit to mastering one of the great salads of our time, dontcha think? You can make it anytime, anywhere\u2014all you need is a few kitchen staples and a head of romaine lettuce\u2014and it\u2019s fairly simple to execute. You\u2019ve just got to bear in mind the few rules that set a superlative Cae Sal apart from a sub par one:1. Cold lettuce = crisp lettuce.The glory of a great Caesar salad lies in the juxtaposition of cold, crunchy refreshing romaine lettuce and fatty, garlicky parmesan-laden dressing. Keep your lettuces cold until right before serving so as to not disturb that beautiful balance. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be eating warm wilted greens slathered in mayo. Yuggg.2. Homemade dressing is the only dressing.Whether you\u2019re making a dressing completely from scratch by emulsifying oil into egg yolks, or simply zhuzhing up some Hellman\u2019s with all the classic components of a Caesar dressing (two totally acceptable options!), a homespun dressing is crucial. Neither one of the two major players in a great Caesar dressing\u2014fresh garlic and lemon juice\u2014has a particularly long shelf life. Which means that the bottled dressings you find in the supermarket are likely packed with citric acid and/or garlic flavorings to mimic their flavor, or preservatives to extend their longevity. And there\u2019s nothing delicious about that.3. \u2018Choves are not optional.I am fully aware that tiny pungent tinned fish are not everyone's idea of a good time. I am not a fan of whole anchovies myself. But there is no denying their power in a proper Caesar dressing. When mashed to a paste and dispersed throughout the salad, they provide umami and depth of flavor without tasting noticeably \u201cfishy.\u201d Look for oil-packed anchovies, which are milder and less salty than the one that are packed in, well, salt. Okay, if you really and truly can\u2019t stand the idea of them, leave them out. But if you\u2019re on the fence and about to tackle homemade Caesar for the first time, stay with me. Don\u2019t knock it til you try it, as they say. (They say that, right?)This right here is my perfect salad.\nPhoto and Food Styling by Molly Baz4. Don't snooze on the crouts.Croutons break up some of the monotony of eating a big bowl of lettuce, offer fun new texture, and also taste really friggin\u2019 great. In an ideal world, you\u2019d make those croutons yourself. The key to a superlative crouton starts with sturdy bread (a country loaf, crusty baguette, or boule is perfect) and will therefore remain crisp no matter how heavily they\u2019re drenched in dressing. Tearing the bread into bite sized pieces before tossing it generously with oil and baking it until golden brown and crisp all the way through will yield lots of craggy nooks and crannies for optimal dressing clingage.5. Parmigiano Reggiano > all other poser parmesan cheese.There is parmesan cheese\u2014and then there is Parmigiano Reggiano. The nuttiness, milk-y sweetness, and crystallized texture of Parmigiano Reggiano is unrivaled by its poser counterparts. Why? Because cheeses that are labeled \u201cparmesan\u201d are not beholden to the quality and aging regulations that set Parmigiano Reggiano apart, so you never really know what you\u2019re gonna get. A great Caesar salad features quite a bit of cheese, so your best bet is to forego the lower quality stuff (and especially that terrifying shelf stable canned stuff!) Invest in good parm, your tastebuds will thank you. (If you\u2019re purchasing parm from a market that grates Parmigiano Reggiano freshly in-house, like Whole Foods or another high-end grocery store, by all means go for the pre-grated stuff. Otherwise, buy a block and grate in yourself. In a food processor, this is fast and efficient.)6. Always be grindin'.Black pepper exists in a Caesar to counteract all of the fatty dressing (it\u2019s mayo after all). But that stuff that was pre-ground months ago? No flavor, no heat, no aroma, no point. It\u2019s crucial to grind it fresh every time\u2014fresh-ground pepper is more fragrant, potent, and spicy than anything pre-ground. And while we\u2019re on the subject, if you ask me, there\u2019s one pepper grinder that rules them all. It\u2019s called the Unicorn and I can\u2019t recommend it highly enough!7. Season that sal.I know, I know, I\u2019m a broken record, but puuuulease don\u2019t forget about the salt! Because romaine has a high water content, and that water will dilute the dressing, you\u2019ve got to season both the dressing and the lettuces in order for the salad to be properly seasoned through and through.That\u2019s it, folks! You\u2019re now ready to master the great Caesar salad. A little bit of love and attention to detail (and some vigorous whisking) will you get you there in no time at all. And who knows, maybe you\u2019ll even consider getting your own pair of custom Cae Sal sneaks to celebrate?
