For dinner with people you love. For the best cacio e pepe in town. For Italian food so simple it\u2019s transcendent. Via Carota is a neighborhood restaurant worth traveling across boroughs to at least pretend you live in that neighborhood. And for a few hours, no one will know otherwise.ORDER THE: cacio e pepe that\u2019s the perfect ratio of pepper to bouncy noodle; insanely rich wild boar ragu with buttery but never gummy pappardelle; a negroni; another negroni; and all the vegetables from the \u201cverdure\u201d section you can handle but especially the roasted carrots, mushrooms, fava beans (when in season), and piselli (peas and prosciutto). For mains, you can\u2019t go wrong with whatever the whole fish offering is, svizzerina (a hand-cut, hamburger-like steak), or the fried rabbit, but who can resist the specials? Trust in the special, which celebrates whatever is in season and leans towards decadence for the sake of decadence. That\u2019s why we go out to dinner, isn\u2019t it?WORD TO THE WISE: The nicer the weather, the longer the wait, especially for the limited outdoor seats. Yet, the wait is always shorter than they say. Don\u2019t let the chaotic chalk-on-a-post system stress you out. Show up early for dinner, or prepare to camp out with a negroni. You\u2019ll never regret calling in sick for work and scheduling a day around a rosato-soaked lunch either.THE VIBE IS: not \u201crustic\u201d in the design blog sense. The reclaimed wooden floors, hutch full of china, and long marble bar work in concert to make you feel right at home\u2014in your fantasy Italian countryside home, that is. The warm chandelier lighting makes the place glow at night in a flickering candlestick kind of way that detoxes you from a day in fluorescence. A row of two-tops by the window can make the restaurant seem cramped, but all of the bodies hum and laugh together in this beautiful communal experience we call supper. If someone accidentally bumps into your chair, say hello.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day, from 11:00 a.m to midnight.\u2014Alex BeggsCerruti DraimeWE ALSO LOVELiliaA special occasion spot that changes the pasta paradigmLe CoucouA fine French meal that turns any night into a special occasionMomofuku KoHang out with chefs at David Chang\u2019s continually groundbreaking spot in the East VillageExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
