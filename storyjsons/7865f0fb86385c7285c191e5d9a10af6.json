You know who you are. You spend your long weekends, holidays, and summer vacations hunched over 1,000 cardboard pieces until they cooperate into a scene so beautiful you\u2019re tempted to glue it together and hang it on your basement wall. That\u2019s passion. That\u2019s joy. I feel it deeply. I freaking love puzzles. I once did a round-up of them for The Strategist, which is how the creators of Piecework Puzzles found me.And I\u2019m so glad they did! Rachel Hochhauser and Jena Wolfe make these arty, surreal puzzles I fell in love with at first glance. Or maybe I\u2019m a millennial suckered in by good millennial branding! Most puzzles are folksy or wholesome or, ugh, educational. The art rarely feels as fresh as a just-stirred martini. But these do. The image of a bejeweled manicured hand smashing into a cake is as beautifully destructive as putting a puzzle together only to break it back down to return to the box. My sister and I spent nearly a week on that one, called \u201cLife of the Party\u201d, recently. She took on the entire hand and cake portion while I wandered from the ribbons to the milk glass cake stand. Then the solid blue portion nearly broke us, but we kept at it until piece number 1,000 found her way home. Next up, we\u2019re tackling Forbidden Fruit, a saturated still life with cut fruit on a bright orange (SOLID, WHY?!) background. I might have to fly puzzle lover Marissa Ross to New York to help us finish.Right now Piecework makes four puzzles, all $36 each. After we finished Life of the Party, we tore her back down, and traded it with our puzzle exchange friends (you should have some!), Noah and Sarah, who in turn, gifted us with Mt. Burger, a garage sale find. I imagine in the garage sales of 2049, nabbing a well-loved Piecework Puzzle will be just as thrilling.Buy it: Piecework PuzzlesAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
