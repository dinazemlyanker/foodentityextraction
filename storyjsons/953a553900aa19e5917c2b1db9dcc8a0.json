That\u2019s where we got the idea to take down the temperature of a classic hot toddy for a more refreshing approach to the seasonal mix of tea, citrus, spices, and rye whiskey.Ingredients8 servings1medium orange5\u20136medium lemons43\" cinnamon sticks14\" piece ginger, peeled, smashed, plus more thinly sliced for serving4Earl Grey tea bags1tsp. whole cloves\u2154cup honey2cups rye whiskey1tsp. orange or regular bittersOrange twists (for serving)PreparationStep 1Using a vegetable peeler, remove zest from orange and 1 lemon in wide strips, leaving white pith behind; slice fruit in half. Squeeze juice from orange into a small bowl (you should have about \u00bc cup). Squeeze juice from lemon into a measuring glass. Slice remaining lemons in half and squeeze juice into glass to measure 1 cup total; save any remaining lemon halves for another use. Set orange and lemon juice aside.Step 2Place zest in a small saucepan. Whack cinnamon sticks with the side of a chef\u2019s knife to break up a little and add to saucepan along with smashed ginger, tea bags, cloves, and 1\u00be cups water. Bring to a boil and immediately remove from heat; let sit 5 minutes. Remove tea bags, then stir in honey; let cool completely, about 20 minutes.Step 3Strain tea mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a pitcher and add rye, bitters, and reserved orange juice and lemon juice. Add 2 cups ice and stir until ice is melted and toddy is very cold.Step 4To serve, pour toddy into tumblers filled with ice and garnish with ginger slices and orange twists.Step 5Do Ahead: Tea mixture can be made 3 days ahead; cover and chill. Toddy can be made 1 day ahead; cover and chill.How would you rate Cold Toddy?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleIt was 85\u00b0 on Christmas Eve this year so I went searching for a cold holiday drink and found exactly what I was looking for with this Cold Toddy.
