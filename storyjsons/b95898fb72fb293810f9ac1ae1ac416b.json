Dijon mustard1garlic clove, finely gratedPinch of kosher salt\u00becup extra-virgin olive oil2Tbsp. fresh lemon juice2lb. vegetables (such as blanched long beans, wax beans, and/or sugar snap peas; sliced cucumbers; cherry tomatoes; radishes; and/or boiled fingerling potatoes)1\u00bdlb. protein (such as sliced ham, cooked shrimp, and/or boiled eggs)PreparationCombine egg yolks, mustard, garlic, and a pinch of salt in a medium bowl set on top of a kitchen towel laid across a small heavy pot (this setup will anchor the bowl while you whisk so you have a free hand for pouring). Whisking constantly, add oil to egg mixture, starting with just a few drops and gradually increasing amount to a fine steady stream. Stop adding if there is any unincorporated oil in the bowl; going slow is key. Keep whisking until emulsified, then whisk in lemon juice. Taste and season aioli with more salt if needed. Serve with vegetables and proteins of choice.How would you rate Grand Aioli?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTrianglePretty good but I thought there was a bit too much oil for the amount of lemon juice in here? Maybe I did something wrong but I followed instructions to a tee. After tasting I added some red wine vinegar to balance it out and another clove of garlic for some extra flavor.
