For those of us holed up in an office all day, who can\u2019t wait to get home and change into our sweats, there are no better socks to pad around the house in, from fridge to sofa to bathroom back to sofa.Richly cushioned, they keep your feet warm while walking on a cold tiled floor, but they\u2019ve also got this mesh venting thing happening so your feet never get schvitzy. This matters to me, in that I\u2019m just slightly particular about my socks, as I\u2019ve noted before.And in true H&B fashion, they\u2019re boldly colored and patterned and come with inspiring but somehow not cheesy phrases stitched into the bottoms, like \u201cTRY TRY AGAIN\u201d and \u201cGO GO GO.\u201d You know, in case you need motivation to get up off the couch to grab another pint of mint chocolate chip.Buy it: Hedley & Bennett Chef Crew Socks, $16 for a pair at Hedley & BennettAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
