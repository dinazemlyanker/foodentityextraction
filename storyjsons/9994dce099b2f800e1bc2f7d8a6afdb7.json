It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Just because there are lots of bad pi\u00f1a coladas out there doesn\u2019t mean pi\u00f1a coladas in general are bad. Those kinds of overgeneralizations can really get in the way of life\u2019s enjoyments. But I get it. Bad pi\u00f1a coladas are all bad in the same way: too sweet, too watery, not rummy enough. Proper pi\u00f1a coladas are perfect and amazing. They are joyful and inebriating, amusing and playful, summery and photogenic. And the right number of them that you should drink is one.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Our pi\u00f1a colada recipe fixes everything. It has the right pineapple-to-coconut ratio, which is to say that there is lots of frozen pineapple and not that much cream of coconut (half of a pineapple goes into four drinks, and only 6 ounces of sweetened coconut milk, plus 2 ounces unsweetened). We\u2019re so serious about this drink tasting like an actual pi\u00f1a, we tell you to cut, then freeze an excellent pineapple yourself, and we dial up the fresh lime juice to play up the pineapple\u2019s tartness and cut through the sweet stuff.But the real test of an expertly made pi\u00f1a colada is the texture. A disappointing one will be loose and crumbly, with visible ice chips, or watery, with long icy shards that melt instantly. But this blender-whipped concoction slow-motion cascades out of the pitcher as fluffy, dense, aerated slush.Photo by Alex LauThe only way to get that penguin-friendly consistency without a slushy machine is to blend, then freeze, then re-blend the partially frozen pineapple-rum-coconut-ice mixture. It might sound fussy, but it\u2019s actually doing something. When you put the blended concoction back into the freezer, you encourage the ice crystals to link back up again, suspending the alcohol and sugar and fruit mixture in the process. Reblending whips some air into the drink and smooths out the crystals, but because the mixture is so icy-cold the second time around, it won\u2019t warm up enough in the blender to get watery. That\u2019s how you get that pillowy, smooth, creamy cocktail, which you can gild with a cherry, a cocktail umbrella, or one of those tiny, neon-colored plastic monkeys that hang off the side of the glass. I love those.Brad Leone, video host of It\u2019s Alive and the author of this recipe, recommends an extra splash of rum poured right over the top. Since you\u2019re only having the one, there\u2019s really no harm in taking his advice.Get the recipe:BA's Best Pi\u00f1a ColadaFreezing fresh pineapple definitely makes the best impact flavor-wise in this pi\u00f1a colada recipe.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterSummer DrinksRumPineappleRead MorerestaurantsWhen It\u2019s Too Hot to Think, I Need a PainkillerBy Alex BeggsrestaurantsWe\u2019re All Adults Here\u2014Stop Expecting Plastic Straws in Your DrinkBy Elyse InamineLifestyleThis Is My Non-Alcoholic Drink of the SummerBy Christina ChaeyLifestyleWe'll Be Drinking Co-Fermented Wines All Summer LongBy Marissa A.
