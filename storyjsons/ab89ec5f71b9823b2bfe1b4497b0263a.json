The empty lot set among looming condominiums and corporate offices became home to 16 food vendors serving both international and Caribbean food, prepared by some of the island\u2019s most celebrated chefs and rising stars.Then, less than a year after the park opened, Hurricane Maria transformed the space again.Compared to much of the island, the food park weathered Maria well and emerged from the Category 4 storm with mere landscaping damage. Equipped with a generator to power the kioscos during intermittent outages, Lote reopened within two weeks. \u201cEveryone was trying to understand what was happening, and people were still struggling with basic needs, but we thought, \u2018What can we do to disconnect for a moment, what can we give people during this crisis so they don\u2019t leave the island, like many did,\u201d Sumaza says.Lote 23 had already offered weekly yoga classes before Maria. Now, Sumaza and her team were seeing upwards of 60 people show up for each class, nearly double the attendance before.\u201cYoga worked as an excellent tool to take people's minds away from the disaster and focus on the positive,\u201d explained Valerie Santiago in an email. Santiago is the owner of El Estudio, Yoga I Love you, whose instructors volunteer every Sunday to teach an open-air class at Lote 23. \u201cPeople felt the need to open up to new spaces and experiences.\u201dDrinks from Caneca, a cocktail bar housed inside an Airstream trailer at Lote 23.\nPhoto by Juanky AlvarezMeanwhile a collaboration with local booking platform Stageboom and musical acts including \u00c9mina, Beto Torrens, and Roots Ensemble gave residents an opportunity to unwind between hours spent lining up for gasoline and searching for cell service. \u201cHaving things to do and a place to be was important at that time. Lote felt homey, and, for Puerto Ricans, music is essential,\u201d Santiago adds.Lote\u2019s chefs, many of whom relied on the island\u2019s local produce, \u201chad to adapt their menus to whatever they could get,\u201d says Sumaza. The space also served as a lifeline for chefs like Carlos Portela, whose restaurant 20 miles from San Juan, Orujo, lost power for six months. Portela operated a pop-up kiosk serving mac and cheese variations during this time to keep himself financially afloat.\u201cOur people are eager to help,\u201d says Crystal D\u00edaz, Marketing Director for Cinco Sentidos, the culinary group that operates Croqueter\u00eda, another Lote kiosk. \u201cWe like to make people feel at home.\u201dAs Puerto Rico gradually recovers and approaches Maria\u2019s one-year anniversary, Lote pulses with convivial energy. Lately, they\u2019ve hosted afternoon markets showcasing local designers and artisanal producers, and themed weekend dinners. Six days a week, locals and tourists collect around picnic tables and bar tops. They dip handmade queso manchego and ham croquetas in tomato chutney, sip crafted concoctions with names like Missionary\u2019s Downfall and Ticket to Austin, and contemplate paleta flavors (Mango chile? Strawberry cheesecake?). Occasionally there\u2019s a collective yelp from the middle of the lot as another giant Jenga game ends.Sumaza describes all this as the \u201cnew normal.\u201d \u201cYou never know when the electricity is going to be out,\u201d she says. On the surface, Lote feels like the typical, hip hangout; colorful murals splashed on walls, strung lights twinkle overhead when the sun goes down. Generators remain close by.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishPuerto RicoPuerto RicanRead MorecultureWhat Will Puerto Rican Food Look Like After Hurricane Maria?By Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
