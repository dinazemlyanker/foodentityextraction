But here, we boil Yukon Golds and tear them into craggy pieces: It makes for tender, buttery pieces that can better soak up the tomatoey spiced pan sauce. Do be sure to let the chicken rest: Letting it sit for 45 minutes helps prevent the juices from running out of the meat as soon as you slice into it.Ingredients4 servings13\u00bd\u20134-lb. chickenKosher salt1Tbsp. coriander seeds1Tbsp. fennel seedsZest of 1 small orangeZest of 1 medium lemon\u00bccup extra-virgin olive oil1Tbsp. mild red pepper flakes (such as Aleppo-style, Maras, or Urfa)1Tbsp. smoked paprika\u00becup low-sodium chicken broth or water\u00bdcup dry white wine1Tbsp. tomato paste4garlic cloves, crushed2lb. medium Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled2Tbsp. finely chopped parsleySpecial EquipmentA spice mill or mortar and pestlePreparationStep 1Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season generously inside and out with salt.

Only change was to use 2 game hens and cut roasting time down. Easy to cut them in half and serve. Sauce is outstanding\n AnonymousOrcas, WA3/8/2021Absolutely adored the flavors here. The scent of the citrus mingled with the fennel and coriander was heavenly. The potatoes tossed in the thick, tomatoey citrusy spicy sauce was perfect. The only negative was that some of the eaters love their chicken piping hot, so the 45 minute rest seemed excessive. Would definitely make again. Served with some saut\u00e9ed mixed greens.
