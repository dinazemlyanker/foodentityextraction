Depending on the time and place, this can take the shape of a BEC, eggs Benedict, or huevos rancheros. It\u2019s a remarkably flexible formula, a blueprint with a long-standing reputation that inspires endless possibilities.\u00a0And there\u2019s no question which version of this equation I turn to on the reg. It\u2019s the Filipino breakfast staple silog, and I make it in one form or another multiple times a week. It\u2019s my swift and hurried workday meal, my fancy family weekend breakfast, the object of my late-night hangover lust, and my champion ride or die.What is silog?Silog is a portmanteau of its two components: sinangag (garlic fried rice) and itlog (egg). Sinangag begins with a bounty of chopped garlic, which sizzles steadily in a blanket of oil and reemerges as crispy golden confetti. The garlic bits are strained from the oil and set aside, leaving behind a flavorful, savory fat. Cold leftover rice is added and tossed until warm and fragrant before it\u2019s reunited with the crunchy garlic flakes. My ideal sinangag is earthy and flavorful but doesn\u2019t overwhelm the dish at large. Since I don\u2019t like my sinangag too greasy, I use half of the garlic oil to fry the eggs, which should be runny but viscous, so that the yellow yolk lazes into the rice when punctured. And like a cherry on top of dessert, the egg should gleam with a brilliant, inviting flourish.Silogs are usually served with a protein, and there are many variations. When I was growing up, my mom always kept our freezer stocked with vacuum-sealed packages of store-bought tocino (cured pork), brick-colored logs of longganisa sausage, and tuyo, a salty dried fish that\u2019s notoriously smelly but tastes wonderful; in the pantry, metal cans of Spam and corned beef sat side by side. These were all indications (promises, really) of silogs to come.When serving sinangag and itlog with a protein, the shorthand of the protein is prefixed to \u201csilog,\u201d creating another portmanteau. Hot dogs plus silog equals \u201chotsilog,\u201d bangus fish plus silog equals \u201cbangsilog,\u201d and so on. While pan-frying is the most common cooking method for silog proteins, grilling is another viable option. Just about anything can be served silog style, which means it\u2019s a great meal for repurposing leftovers or using up whatever you have on hand.What is tapsilog?The most famous silog by far is tapsilog, made with beef tapa. (The term tapsilog was coined in 1986 by Vivian Del Rosario, who, working in the corner of a Quezon City parking lot, sold budget-friendly breakfast plates featuring tapa, sinangag, and itlog to local jeepney and tricycle drivers.)It\u2019s commonly agreed that the origin of tapa dates back to the pre-refrigeration era, when meats were cured and dried under the sun as a form of preservation. Today, the thinly sliced beef is often simply marinated before it\u2019s cooked. The typical marinade consists of soy sauce, sugar (from white or brown sugar or even Coca-Cola), garlic, an acid (like calamansi, lemon, or vinegar), and black pepper. There\u2019s more than one right way to make tapa, and you can easily adjust according to your preferences. I always go for a sweeter tapa, so my recipe has an extra touch of brown sugar, which also creates crunchy caramelized edges and a sumptuous glossy finish. I like to include a sprinkle of crushed red pepper flakes to enhance the mild heat of the black pepper and add an extra spicy kick. Because beef has a tendency to release moisture when pan-fried, which can hinder caramelization, I also add a bit of cornstarch to the marinade, which helps lock in moisture.Like with the marinade, there\u2019s more than one way to cook tapa. Some simmer the beef and marinade together until the moisture evaporates, but I prefer to remove the meat from the marinade and pan-fry it: It\u2019s faster and less likely to produce dry, overcooked beef. Plus, the high and direct heat of the pan-fry gives me a better char. Top sirloin is the best cut for tapa\u2014even better if you can snag one with some good marbling. Slice it against the grain into bite-size pieces (I usually cut my slices about \u00bd\" thick).What\u2019s served with silog?Silogs are complete on their own and don\u2019t require anything else. But if you\u2019re looking to refresh the palate from the rich savoriness silog delivers, sliced tomato, sliced cucumber, atchara (pickled papaya), and tart, spicy vinegar are welcome accompaniments.Remember: your silog, your rulesSilog can be whatever and whenever you want. You can choose any protein! You can make sunny-side up, over-medium, or scrambled eggs! Sure, it\u2019s traditionally a breakfast dish. But it\u2019s hearty enough for a family dinner, exciting enough for a weekend brunch, and can be scaled down for a simple afternoon meal, for those times when you forget to eat until noon. It\u2019s sure to fill you up fast.Get the recipe!TapsilogSweet-salty peppery beef, crunchy garlic rice, and a runny fried egg make this Filipino breakfast perfect for any meal of the day.\u00a0View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titFilipinoRecipes you want to make.
