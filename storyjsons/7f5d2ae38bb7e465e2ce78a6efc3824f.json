While most dips like this require you to babysit caramelizing onions on the stovetop for what feels like forever, our (relatively) hands-off version lets the oven do most of the work. It's kind of counterintuitive, but you want to keep the onions and garlic in a mound on the sheet pan rather than spreading them out; this allows them to steam and soften without browning too quickly.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Just be very, very careful when removing the screaming hot pan from the grill. A length of black iron pipe slid over the handle works for us. The onions get very brown, very fast, and the oil that they cook in is fantastic, also. foundrygirlSeattle, WA1/2/2022No. Just no. Those onions in the picture for the dip look anemic and not even what I would call \u201cgrilled,\u201d let alone caramelized. I want jammy, sweet (without even adding sugar) onions where you start with a heaping pile and end up with scant little bowlful. I find nothing tedious about making them on the stovetop. I do it on medium heat for the first 10 minutes, covered. And then lower the heat and let them go for almost 2 hours, stirring every 15 minutes. Oh, and a bonus tip: making them in a cast iron skillet keeps your pan seasoned and slick as nonstick.Jacki GanschColumbus Ohio6/14/2021This looks wonderful and easy, and I do intend to try it, but... I'm looking at this for the 1st time in early June. Think I'll wait until at least Sept before I crank the oven to 400 for 50 mins.Dan WConnecticut6/7/2021SO good and easy. Highly recommend lizMontreal 11/21/2020I liked this recipe. I did the onions in a dutch oven on the stove top instead of in the oven, and let them go for almost 2 hrs. I feel like they're less work then doing them in the oven, tbh. Added more acid then called for. Will make again!AnonymousPhiladelphia10/6/2020Giddy up good! No alterations to the recipe except added some julienned zucchini and sweet peppers from the garden for dipping. Let it season for a few hours in the fridge. Made it to take to a gathering, about half of it made it there. RobustogolfKingston, Ontario8/24/2020Very tasty and easy to make. Onions worked in the oven but did take ~70 minutes. Amped up the lemon as others suggested and added some South African Smoke mix from Trader Joes and old bay for seasonings before letting it hang out in the fridge for a few hours (magic). Sprinkled chili powder and paprika on top to serve.honeysrirachapleaseBrooklyn8/22/2020I enjoyed it, i did 2 tablespoons of lemon and cooked the onions for about an hour.  I think the greek yogurt flavor was a little strong.Anonymousseattle, wa6/14/2020This was so delicious and so easy. I did have a few problems with my onions burning on the tips so I needed to toss more often. sarahmaeveHouston 6/4/2020Mine also turned out quite 'sweet'. I came around to the flavour, but it's definitely not anything like the MSG/salt punch you get from the soup mix kind of dip. Which is totally fine, of course. I roasted my onions and garlic for a bit longer than called for in the recipe until they looked like the gif, so I wouldn't be afraid to go a bit longer if yours still look very blond.AnonymousNew York4/22/2020effin bomb recipe. so simple but so satisfying. niccsuxSingapore3/1/2020Made this for a NYE party, and it was a huge hit. The AirBnb I was in didn't have real knives which was a struggle, but I made it work. Onions didn't get chopped as finely as I would have liked, but it was still pretty great. Served it with Ruffles :)AnonymousColumbia, SC1/11/2020Love this recipe and just made it for a 2nd time. I've made a couple modifications: \n1. Instead of a sheet pan, i'm using a Le Crueset 7\"x10\" rectangular dish. This keeps the onions piled together, and allows water/oil to stay in place. When I used the sheet pan it spread under the parchment paper and made a big mess. \n2. I used 2 cups of yogurt: Fage 5% is great!\n3. I increased lemon juice to taste... probably closer to 4/5 tsp\n\nEnjoy!MaineChef12312/31/2019This was a game-changing caramelized onion technique for me, but my Trader Joe's yogurt was just too sweet up against the sweet onions. I added a ton of pepper to counter it, but next time I'll do sour cream as the base instead. alexbeggsBon App\u00e9tit 12/11/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titDipCalifornia CuisineAmericanOnionVegetableEasySnackStarterGluten-FreeNut-FreeVegetarianRoastSuper BowlDinnerBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
