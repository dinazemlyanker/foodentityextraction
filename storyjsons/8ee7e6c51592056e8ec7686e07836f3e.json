I bought it eight weeks ago, frozen and vacuum-sealed, and it had been sitting in the deep recesses of my freezer ever since. And then Saturday morning, as I was wondering just what the heck I was going to do all day\u2014besides laundry and other chores\u2014a light bulb went off.Carnitas!Have you ever made carnitas? Pork braised in its own fat till crispy but still tender? As a cooking project, it presents that perfect balance of being both easy and time consuming. Which, frankly, during these self-isolating months is exactly what I can handle.There are different ways to approach this beloved and storied Mexican dish. You can check out Rick Martinez\u2019s recipe for Double Pork Carnitas, or his recipe for Duck Carnitas, or you can listen to Rick and me talk carnitas on the Bon App\u00e9tit Foodcast. (If you haven\u2019t gathered, Rick has a thing for carnitas.)But I kind of winged it. I browned and then braised the pork shoulder with a bunch of chopped up veg and some chicken stock and wine. Three hours later, I strained the liquid, popped it in the freezer and then skimmed the congealed lard from the surface.Want this letter before it hits the website?

(I guess you could say my technique is a bit more akin to Gaby Melian\u2019s Instant Pot Carnitas recipe.) At this point, I would\u2019ve been happy to sit there at the cutting board with a bottle of beer and tub of sea salt and just go at the succulent pork shoulder. But half the fun of making carnitas is crowning it with a constellation of complimentary dishes. Something to do, something to take your mind off yet another weekend that doesn\u2019t really feel like a weekend, and something to get your spouse and kid excited about.So I sliced up some ripe avocados. I quartered some limes. I quick-pickled some red onion and showered it with chopped parsley and mint (because Rick, in his epic taco primer a few months back, declared that cilantro is not required, and that it\u2019s time other herbs get some love). I warmed some brothy pinto beans I had in my fridge. I heated up some jarred queso that my 12-year-old loves. I opened up a bag of chips. And just before sitting down, I blistered some tortillas in a cast-iron skillet and wrapped them in a dish towel to stay warm and moist.And then I devoured more carnitas tacos than I could count. Not a bad Saturday after all.Get the recipeDouble-Pork CarnitasIt\u2019s worth seeking out pork belly for the amazing texture it lends, but if you can\u2019t get it, substitute with another pound of shoulder.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterRead MorecultureStockpile These Tortillas for a Lifetime of Great TacosBy Aliza AbarbanelcookingI've Been Thinking About These Spicy Migas Tacos For Two Years StraightBy Alex DelanycultureIt\u2019s Time We Give the Mexican Combo Platter the Credit It DeservesBy Patricia Esc\u00e1rcegacultureRoy Choi\u2019s Korean Tacos Are My American DreamBy Margaret Cho, as told to Sasha LevineRecipes you want to make.
