This week: the ham and cheese waffles recipe that associate web editor Alyse Whitney just couldn't live without.Hello! Please hit play on Evanesence's song \u201cBring Me to Life\u201d while reading this story for full effect.Okay, now that you are rocking out to this 2003 GRAMMY-AWARD-WINNING hit song, you\u2019ll understand the references to my favorite Bon App\u00e9tit throwback brunch recipe: ham and cheese waffles. These waffles wake me up inside when I can\u2019t wake up on a Saturday morning. They saaaave me from the nothing I\u2019ve become after a long work week. When it feels like I\u2019ve been sleeping a thousand years, they open my eyes to everything.That was a fun use of song lyrics, but I need you to take me seriously when I say this is one of the best breakfasts, brunches, or brinners I\u2019ve ever made. The exterior is extra crispy from melted cheddar cheese, and the inside is fluffy and airy. It's like eating a breakfast sandwich in waffle form! If you put a fried egg on it, it\u2019s Croque-Madame-ish...without the fussy b\u00e9chamel. The recipe uses three bowls, which is an unfortunate amount of dishes, but it's worth it. One is used to whip egg whites\u2014I use my trusted KitchenAid hand mixer so I don\u2019t sprain my wrist from whisking forever\u2014another is for mixing wet ingredients, and the last is for combining dry ingredients. The secret ingredient is soda water, which helps the batter rise, but I\u2019ve made them with regular water in a pinch and they turned out okay. What you shouldn\u2019t skimp on is the aggressive-seeming amount of melted butter. The two sticks are divided amongst 12 servings, so trust in the recipe\u2014that works out to about a half tablespoon of butter per waffle. The calculations on the recipe are for two small square waffles per person, but with my standard circular Belgian-style waffle maker, I can do at least eight. (For what it's worth, I am coveting the \u201cCadillac of waffle makers,\u201d an All-Clad square version.)Buy me a fancy waffle maker and I will love you forever.\nPhoto by Alex LauThere\u2019s one other little trick to making perfect ham and cheese waffles: sprinkling the ham and shredded cheddar over each waffle rather than mixing it into the bowl of batter. (Highly recommend Cabot Seriously Sharp for your cheese!) The first time I made them, I didn\u2019t follow this step and had unevenly dispersed pockets of ham and cheese\u2014some waffles without any fillings in an entire quadrant of the waffle! For shame! Having the cheese making contact with the waffle iron makes it like a cheddar frico around the edges, aka the breakfast grilled cheese of your dreams. Just make sure to butter or oil your waffle iron so it doesn\u2019t stick.I have one little secret though: Sometimes I use store-bought waffle mix when I\u2019m lazy and/or drank too much the night before but still need to satisfy the craving. I doctor up boxed mix\u2014I grew up in a Hungry Jack family, so usually that\u2014with an egg, a few tablespoons of melted butter, and a smattering of scallions or chives (those go on regardless of if it\u2019s boxed or homemade waffle mix). With all the flavor from the ham and cheese, I can barely tell the difference, and neither can my friends and family. Everyone I\u2019ve made this for has asked for the recipe midway through their first few bites. A little more butter and syrup on top brings a sweet and salty hit that will wake you up inside, enough to dance to a throwback playlist of 2003 emo songs. I suggest listening to Fall Out Boy's \"Saturday\" next, because with ham and cheese waffles, these open doors are indeed open-ended.
