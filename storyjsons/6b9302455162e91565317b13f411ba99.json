The Orange Is the New Black actress took many years to embrace her Colombian heritage and tell the story of her parents\u2019 deportation in her first memoir, In the Country We Love, but once she got started, she was full steam ahead. She adapted the book for a younger audience to help kids in immigrant families in My Family Divided (in stores July 17th), and, earlier this year, she teamed up with Reese Witherspoon to host How It Is, a podcast that invites women to tell their stories in their own words. Topics have included combating sexism in Silicon Valley, dealing with PTSD, and empowering female farmers, with guests like Gabrielle Union, Ellen Pao, and Lena Waithe.Recently Guerrero and I sat down for coffee, arepas, and arom\u00e1ticas (Colombian infused water in flavors like pineapple\u2013ginger and strawberry\u2013basil ) in front of a huge living plant wall at Dev\u00f3cion in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. She discussed stories she wants to tell, experiences that molded her, and the Colombian dishes she turns to for comfort.Photo by Emma FishmanHow It Is is such a powerful podcast. What made you passionate about helping these women tell their stories, in their own words?When we explored the #MeToo movement and Time\u2019s Up, I realized that I never took the time to think about the troubles I experienced as a woman. For so long, I was consumed by my family\u2019s immigration status, growing up poor, and dealing with racism, and I found it hard to put myself with those [feminist] movements. I learned so much listening to other women\u2019s stories and recalled all the microaggressions I\u2019ve dealt with. How many times was I abused? Was I violated? It was like a normal thing that a man would talk down to me, and totally normal for someone to say something completely sexist and me laugh it off. Now I know that\u2019s not right. And I know my worth.What kind of stories do you want to tell next?I want to cover different women of color and the facets of their lives growing up. I also want to explore more stories from the disabled community and their experiences. We are all together in this fight. Next season, we will also focus on worth and value, whether it\u2019s the value of money, your self-worth, or the value of working together.Time\u2019s Up was integral in that. What has been your experience with the fight for equal pay?I have a lot of wonderful people looking out for me. There\u2019s no way for me to tell who\u2019s getting paid more but I know what my worth is. I\u2019m always looking out to see that I\u2019m not being cut short. Even in the work that I do\u2014not taking certain roles that aren\u2019t exploring the full character\u2019s potential, or that will set my community back. I am conscious of the community that I\u2019m representing and don\u2019t play into stereotypes.Have you ever been asked to do an accent?I used to go to auditions all the time and people were like, \u201cCan you try it with an accent now?\u201d I would because that\u2019s the way I thought things were and I had to accept that. But doing all of these shows, working on the shows like Orange is the New Black, Jane the Virgin, and Superior Donuts, I know how hard I work. I won\u2019t accept that anymore. I\u2019ll say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t think this character would have an accent so I\u2019m not gonna have one. Why don\u2019t you ask me to do a British accent?\u201d They feel like an audience can\u2019t handle looking at me, a brown woman, with no accent and being from America.In your books, you talked about being bullied as a kid being for not being \u201cLatina enough,\u201d with Dominican and Puerto Rican girls making fun of you for being Colombian. Has your perception of yourself changed since then?Oh my god, absolutely. I feel enough in every aspect of my life. Believe me, there are days I\u2019m not always feeling this confident. There are some days that I have to remind myself, and I have to give myself affirmations, and I have to go to yoga or do something nice for myself. I get nervous about putting myself out there, but I want to encourage others to use their voices too.When did you feel like you embraced your culture and felt confident in who you are?When I shared my story [in memoir In the Country We Love]. It\u2019s taken a long time for me to accept myself for who I am, my story, my parents\u2019 deportation story and our struggle. I always thought if I talked about it and gave it any energy that I would be defined by it.When you seek comfort, are there any Colombian dishes that you make?I love making dishes that my mother used to make. I\u2019ll make the easier ones, like rice and beans with plantains, or her amazing red beet salad with carrots, cilantro, a little tomato, and lemon vinaigrette. I\u2019ll do kale and beans for a healthier, cleaner twist, but still make room for baked plantains with cheese inside, or Colombian empanadas with shredded beef and potato that my dad would make. I also love dipping Cuajada Fresca [a fresh cheese curd] into coffee, chocolate, or Aguapanela, a sugar cane drink with lemon or lime.Is there a signature recipe from your family?When we would go to the beach, my parents wouldn\u2019t want to spend a lot of money on the expensive snacks. So my dad would make a big ass pot of spaghetti with sausage and red sauce, and bring that, plantains, and rice. They just wanted to feed a lot of people, and it was so cheap. So we\u2019d all have spaghetti on the beach\u2014it was hilarious.Is there anything else that connects you with your family, even when you\u2019re thousands of miles away?Before I cook, I always have to put on music that parents listened to while cooking. I remember waking up in the morning and seeing my dad making breakfast with music and cutting up the tomato and singing to it and just handling food with such care. So when I cook, I put on salsa, vallenato, cumbia, or anything that reminds me of Colombia.And sometimes I will purposefully forget a recipe so I can call my mom and have her walk me through it. Next I want to learn to make sancocho, a Colombian soup. It\u2019s usually oxtail but you can make it with pork or chicken too, and it has plantains, potatoes, and all kinds of herbs and spices that I need to have my mom teach me over the phone.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCelebritiesHealthyishInterviewsRead Moreculture'Insecure' Star Yvonne Orji Knows What She Wants Out of Life and BreakfastBy Tahirah Hairstonculture'Battle of the Sexes' Star Natalie Morales Is Queer, Vegetarian, Cuban, and ProudBy Alyse WhitneyLifestyleZoe Lister-Jones on Hiring an All-Women Film Crew and Being a \u2018Bone Brothatarian\u2019By Alyse WhitneyRecipes you want to make.
