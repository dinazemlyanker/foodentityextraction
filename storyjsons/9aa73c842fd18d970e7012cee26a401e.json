But in 2018, pop-ups aren\u2019t merely a precursor; they\u2019re the format of choice for a generation of chefs whose ambitions could never be contained by four walls. From live-fire obsessed chef Danny Newberg, who dropped out of the NYC fine dining scene to host site-specific events under the name Joint Venture, to the work of the I-Collective, a far-flung community of Indigenous chefs and activists who collaborate on events highlighting issues of food sovereignty, sustainability, and native foodways, some of the most compelling meals we had this year were as ephemeral as they were delicious.Take chef Anya Peters. After graduating from the Culinary Institute of America, the 21-year-old felt far away from the Trinidadian and Jamaican home cooking that inspired her to pursue a career in food in the first place.\u201cI was like, if I\u2019m going to reconnect with my heritage, I gotta ask my O.G.s,\u201d she recalls.The chef, Anya Peters\nPhoto by Emma FishmanSo Peters launched Kit an\u2019 Kin, a mostly-monthly Caribbean dinner series that allowed her to not only honor her family\u2019s culinary traditions, but to literally cook alongside the parents, siblings, and grandparents who made the Sunday suppers of her childhood so special. \u201cI finally found who I want my teachers to be, and how I wanted to learn,\u201d she says. \u201cAnyone who has been to our events has eaten food cooked by my dad and been served by my mom.\u201dThe feasts, which feature island classics like coconut-laced rice and peas, fricassee chicken, and flaky patties stuffed with tender braised oxtail, are held at Cafe Erzulie in Brooklyn, on a backyard veranda that Peters and her father built to emulate her mother\u2019s childhood home in Jamaica.\u201cI\u2019m the chef,\u201d Peters says, \u201cbut really I\u2019m a connector, a liaison, and a platform. I want each pop-up to hold space for a family member I\u2019ve learned from.\u201dRead more about the 25 restaurant trends we saw in 2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titHot 10 2018The Hot 10Caribbean/Central AmericanRead MorerestaurantsFor Digby Stridiron, All Roads Lead Back to the Virgin IslandsBy Korsha WilsonsponsoredThese 5 Cocktails Will Make You Want To Escape to the Caribbean ASAPBy Princess Cruisescooking'It\u2019s Puerto Rican Because I Made it'By Korsha WilsonRecipes you want to make.
