You can find them at ansonmills.com, but sesame seeds will also work. This recipe is from Benne on Eagle in Asheville, NC.Ingredients4 servingsBiscuits\u00becup (94 g) whole wheat flour1Tbsp. baking powder2tsp. kosher salt3cups all-purpose flour (375 g), plus more for surface\u00bccup toasted benne or sesame seeds, plus more for sprinkling1cup (2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces, plus 2 Tbsp. melted for brushing1\u00bdcups buttermilkGravy and assembly4Tbsp. unsalted butter1lb. pork breakfast sausage, casings removed1small onion, finely chopped2Tbsp. all-purpose flour2cups whole milk1tsp. apple cider vinegar\u00betsp. crushed red pepper flakesPreparationBiscuitsStep 1Preheat oven to 375\u00b0. Whisk whole wheat flour, baking powder, kosher salt, 3 cups all-purpose flour, and \u00bc cup benne seeds in a large bowl. Work in 1 cup chilled butter, smashing with your hands until pieces are the size of dimes and peas. Add buttermilk; mix with a rubber spatula to bring together. Knead dough a couple of times in the bowl until there are no dry spots remaining.Step 2Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface; pat into a 6\" square. Fold dough in half, then in half again to create a smaller square. Pat back out to make an 8\" square, about 1\" thick. Cut into 9 equal-size squares.Step 3Transfer biscuits to a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing 2\" apart. Brush with 2 Tbsp. melted butter and sprinkle with sea salt and benne seeds. Bake until golden brown all over, 25\u201330 minutes.Gravy and assemblyStep 4Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add sausage and increase heat to medium-high.

And so easy. Love love love it. Will definitely make this again. CaitlinVA12/26/2021Absolutely delicious. I would add a bit less salt  (1 tsp instead of 2) and if the dough gets crumbly, add a little bit of neutral oil before you roll it out. These came out amazingly and the gravy was devine. AnonymousBrooklyn5/18/2020Tore through the magazine and realized that I had everything for the gravy but not enough for the biscuits so I made box-mix squits but pulled off this gravy (!) which was...heaven sauce in a pan. Deeply flavorful and exactly the kind of treat that a Sunday morning in captivity calls for. AnonymousRedwood City, CA 5/11/2020This is easily the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had. Next time I'm in Asheville, I will be making a stop at Benne on Eagle. Bravo!Anonymous5/8/2020These taste delicious and are simple to make! The gravy has just the right amount of light heat to it with the red pepper flakes. Be absolutely sure to cut your 8 inch square dough into 9 exact equal size pieces, so 2.66 in x 2.66 in squares is what you are looking for! Just kidding, not sure why this recipe is so heavy on the math but it tastes awesome!! MastpointDetroit5/5/2020This was so, so good, and easily adapted in Covid times. This is easily the best sausage gravy that I've ever made --- it's a bit spicy on its own, but perfectly tamed with the biscuits. I loved the addition of the apple cider vinegar. I woke to find (at the the flour step in the gravy recipe) that my son had consumed the milk I was planning to use, so I combed the fridge for any leftover dairy and ended up with 3/4 C. whole milk, 1/2 C. whipping cream, 3/4 C. plain whole milk yogurt. Even with those unanticipated changes, it was phenomenal. I also subbed rye flour for wheat in the biscuits because that's what I had on hand. Anonymous5/3/2020I just happened to have benne seeds from Anson Mills but I don't think using regular sesame seeds would have mattered. We made the biscuits with white whole wheat flour instead of whole wheat flour because that's what we had.  The biscuits were a lovely creamy color and absolutely delicious plain with salted French butter. Do be careful to follow the instructions keeping the biscuits to 1 inch. We look forward to making the sausage gravy and cornmeal pancakes!
