Gah! I shuddered just writing that. Because prior to this point, I associated such devices with the cringiest modern portmanteau of a portmanteau: vlogging. (That\u2019s a combination of \u201cvideo\u201d + \u201cblogging,\u201d which is itself a combination of \u201cweb\u201d and \u201clog.\u201d That made me shudder, too!) But we are where we are, living in the shadow of COVID-19, when the stress of being forcibly separated from friends and family in the interest of public health can feel, well, totally heartbreaking. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to not also have to grapple with the absurdity of balancing your phone against every right-angled surface in your home in an attempt to stay in touch with said friends and family? I hate to say it, but a tripod and a mount...really helps.The Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen is Cooking at Home\nIn fairness, I didn\u2019t even buy the equipment I\u2019ve been using\u2014the fine folks on our video team shipped them, along with some other self-taping equipment, to us so that we could continue to crank out that #content while in quarantine. I will admit that I rolled my eyes when I pulled them out of the box. But my gosh I don\u2019t know how I would have gotten through the last four weeks without this goofy contraption. It allows me to position my phone on the counter so that I can cook along with friends, to arrange my parents at table height so it can feel like we\u2019re all sitting and enjoying a drink together, to be able to move freely from room to room on a video chat without having to experiment with every ledge and shelf in my home. And in these strange and uncertain times, that\u2019s big news!You might be thinking to yourself, Hey, this guy said he didn\u2019t even buy these things! How can I really trust this endorsement?! That\u2019s fair enough! But you know what I did do? I bought them for my parents! Because they work. And because they\u2019re worth it. And because I love my parents. And because my mom\u2019s FaceTime videography was giving me vertigo, tbqh.
