Moderate heat allows the cheese inside to fully melt without burning the outsides.IngredientsMakes 24Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature2Tbsp. finely chopped parsley\u00bdgarlic clove, finely grated\u00bdtsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bc tsp. Morton kosher saltFreshly ground black pepper4thick slices Pullman or other sandwich bread4oz. sharp cheddar coarsely gratedPreparationStep 1Mix butter, parsley, garlic, salt, and several grinds of pepper in a small bowl until well combined. Spread a generous amount of butter on one side of bread slices (about 1 Tbsp. per slice).Step 2Place 2 bread slices, butter side down, in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Divide cheese between bread in skillet (it\u2019s okay if some cheese spills over onto skillet; it\u2019s going to become crispy and delicious and that\u2019s why we\u2019re all here, right?) and top with remaining slices of bread, butter side up. Cook, checking after a couple minutes, until bread is golden brown and toasted underneath, about 4 minutes. (Don\u2019t rush! Remember, lower and slower is better.) Carefully turn sandwiches over and cook until second sides are golden brown and cheese is melted, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and slice in half.How would you rate Garlic Bread Grilled Cheese?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (7)Back to TopTriangleWell, this is very good. To make it great, the inside faces of the bread should be toasted, as well. I suggest the following changes:\nStep 2: Butter one side of each slice of bread, using a total of half the butter mix. Place the bread, buttered sides down, on the hot pan and move them around, checking underneath to see that they are browning evenly.\nStep 3: While the bread is browning, butter the sides facing up. Once the underneath sides are brown, flip over half of them so the toasted sides are up. Now put the cheese mix on those halves, then top them with the other halves, toasted side down. Now follow the directions in Step 2 above and you will have bread toasted on the insides as well as the outsides which gives you a much crispier version.Big GuyMalvern PA2/4/2022For years,  I have used a purchased garlic herbed butter, softened at room temp to spread evenly and cover the sliced bread edge to edge.   Tillamook Medium Cheddar, slices or grated. My Tip:  Use metal mixing bowl as a \"dome\" to ensure the cheese melts.
