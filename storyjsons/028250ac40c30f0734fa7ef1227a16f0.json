That takes some time. And the right tools, honestly. That scratched out old non-stick from college isn\u2019t going to cut it for creamy, soft-scrambled eggs. The items on this list are pieces of equipment to guide you in all your egg pursuits from poaching to the crispiest fried egg around. Whatever route you want to take, these are the tools to get there.PHOTO BY CHELSIE CRAIGPHOTO BY CHELSIE CRAIGSaucepanIf for some reason you don\u2019t yet have a saucepan, a hard-boiled, soft-boiled, or wonderfully jammy egg should convince you. Why not try out a series of tests to find your ideal boiled egg time? Then use all of the excess eggs for a big batch of egg salad.Buy It: Cuisinart Stainless Steel 3-Quart Saucepan with Cover, $51 on AmazonPhoto by Chelsie CraigMixing BowlsScramble your eggs in a mixing bowl, use one to combine your ingredients for an egg salad, and have a bowl handy for an ice bath (aka the secret to easy-to-peel hard-boiled eggs).
