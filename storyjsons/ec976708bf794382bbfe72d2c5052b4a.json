For the best of both worlds, tenderize the drumsticks in this pineapple-forward marinade, made with shallots, garlic, shrimp paste, and coconut cream (not to be confused with cream of coconut, which is sweetened and used in cocktails). Then grill the marinated drumsticks over indirect heat to ensure juiciness and then hit them (and some pineapple slices) over direct heat for a few minutes to get the skin crackly. \u2014Rachel GurjarAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Then I put it under the broiler for about 7 minutes on each side, trying to crisp the skin. I wish I had remembered that we like our chicken a bit more \"done\" than most food magazine writers, it needed more baking time and a temp of about 175 for our tastes.\n\nThe finished meal was just so-so, not worth the time or the expense of the ingredients.  It might have been better done on a grill.  The chicken might have been more flavorful if I'd used skinless chicken parts. Shirley PUP of Michigan12/23/2021Anyone have any suggestions for those of us without grills? Can this e baked int he over then put under the broiler to crisp the skin?\n\nI see that Kathy and Jay asked this question in July, and there still doesn't seem to be an answer.  I really wish recipe writers would think about those of us who don't or can't grill.ShirleyUP of Michigan12/20/2021This marinate definitely helps brown nicely, but I think I marinated too long (maybe 2-3 hours?) and the skin got a little chewy instead of crispy - so don't overdo it and stick to 15 minutes or so.  Not suuuuper flavorful, even after that amount of time.  Can never go wrong with grilled pineapple - but I usually like to glaze pineapple with cinnamon-sugar. Jackie MMadison, WI9/12/2021Hmmm\u2026 not sure what I did wrong but it wasn\u2019t very flavorful at all and needed more salt as well. It was tender though. LaurenTexas8/20/2021What Kathy said... \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffbJayJersey City, NJ7/18/2021Just in case, If it's raining when I start the grill for the drumsticks, I'd marinate my chicken for a day or so, then add lemon juice with a dash of seasoning salt to intensify the flavor of the drumsticks.AnonymousUpstate, New York7/15/2021Love this recipe!  However, I guess I didn\u2019t oil the grill enough because the skin stuck and was pretty much gone by the time it finished.  I substituted anchovy paste for the shrimp paste since no one sells shrimp paste around here.  Served with corn salad with hot honey lime dressing from this site.\nYumDCrimminsFolsom, CA7/14/2021For those of us without a grill, could this be done in the oven? Or even just a pared down version on a George Foreman Grill?
