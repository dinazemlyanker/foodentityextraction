As a mother of five, caring for and carting kids to play rehearsals or soccer practice gave her limited spare time to refine her culinary skills, so most Mom-made meals and snacks were relatively straightforward. And my favorite of her simple, homemade snacks was a pimento cheese sandwich, which I ate constantly as a teenager. After I moved to New York, I didn\u2019t eat pimento cheese for a bit, mostly because it wasn\u2019t readily available at my local grocery store the way it had been back in Georgia. So when I found this fiery pimento cheese from Callie\u2019s Hot Little Biscuit online, it felt a bit like coming home.Photograph by Isa Zapata. \u00a0Food Styling by Kat BoytsovaFiery Pimento Cheese$28 at Callie's Hot Little BiscuitPimento cheese is a spread made using cheddar, mayonnaise, pimento peppers (you can also use roasted red bell peppers or piquillo peppers if you don\u2019t have pimento on hand), and hot peppers or hot sauce, but the exact contents can vary depending on the recipe. Traditional pimento cheese (which Callie\u2019s makes as well) has a subtle, very tolerable undertone of spice, but for heat fiends like me, Callie\u2019s fiery pimento cheese incorporates a bit of extra kick thanks to the addition of cayenne. It\u2019s that creamy sort of spicy that settles on the tongue so you can run it around your mouth for a bit before the spice hits the back of your throat.Down South we like to say that if something isn\u2019t good enough, just add butter. Personally, I think that adage also applies to pimento cheese spread. Most anywhere I\u2019d use regular old cheese, I swap in Callie\u2019s fiery pimento cheese instead: Of course it pairs well with crackers and biscuits (make your own or add them to your pimento cheese order), but I especially like to make ham, egg, and pimento cheese bagel sandwiches. The spread warms up when packed in between a toasted bagel and fried egg, turning it slightly runny.There\u2019s not a lot about New York that reminds me of home. But no matter how I use it, Callie\u2019s pimento cheese instantaneously makes me feel like I\u2019m back in the kitchen with my mom, even when she\u2019s over 900 miles away.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make.
