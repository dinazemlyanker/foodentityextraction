Then she developed this method for crackly-skinned, juicy roast breasts that has quickly earned a spot in her regular rotation. Preheating the skillet before adding the chicken jump-starts the browning process; the bones provide a buffer that protects the meat from drying out as the skin gets golden. Use the leftover schmaltz (chicken fat) to make any kind of side, from saut\u00e9ed greens to warm salad dressing to the herby peas and croutons shown here. Frozen peas make this a year-round meal, but you can also use shelled fresh peas.Ingredients4 Servings4skin-on, bone-in chicken breasts (about 3 lb. total)2\u00bdtsp. kosher salt, divided, plus moreFreshly ground black pepper1large shallot, halved, thinly sliced1Tbsp. fresh lemon juice4tsp. (or more) extra-virgin olive oil4cups \u00bc\"\u2013\u00bd\" pieces torn country-style or multigrain bread2Tbsp. unsalted butter3oil-packed anchovy fillets2cups fresh or frozen English peas\u00bccup torn tender herbs (such as basil, parsley, dill, and/or mint)Lemon wedges (for serving)PreparationStep 1Place a rack in middle of oven and set a large cast-iron skillet on rack; preheat oven to 425\u00b0. Pat chicken dry and rub with 2 tsp. salt; season with pepper.Step 2Stir shallot and lemon juice in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper. Set aside.Step 3Pat chicken dry again; rub with oil. Carefully place skin side down in preheated skillet and roast, turning skin side up halfway through, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 150\u00b0, 20\u201325 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cutting board, leaving fat behind, and let rest (temperature will rise as meat sits).Step 4Place skillet on stovetop over medium heat (be careful of that hot handle). Add bread and season with salt and pepper. Toast, stirring often and scraping up browned bits, until golden, about 4 minutes. Add more oil if pan looks dry. Using a slotted spoon, transfer croutons to a plate.Step 5Add butter and anchovies to same skillet and cook, breaking up anchovies with a spoon, until butter is melted. Add peas, remaining \u00bd tsp. salt, and 2 Tbsp. water; season with pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until peas are bright green and warmed through, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat.Step 6Cut chicken meat from bones and slice. Stir croutons, herbs, and reserved shallot mixture into peas; season with salt and pepper. Divide among plates; top with chicken.

I love the varying textures and tastes.  The chicken came out beautifully - juicy and flavorful.  My husband really enjoyed it and it happens to be yummy cold the next day.  Jen M.Los Angeles, CA5/5/2021This was absolutely delicious! 100% make again. My chicken breast was a bit big so it took about 10 more mins to cook but did not change any other thing. I used parsley, basil and mint for my herbs. Simply perfect. CamiejoPlaya del Rey, CA4/28/2021I need to be honest. When I saw this recipe, I said, \"Oh, boring,\" but I happened to have bread staling and everything other than the chicken in my pantry. So glad I didn't pass this up! All of the proportions were exactly right for me (appreciate all of the cues for seasoning, too). Chicken was wonderfully crispy and juicy (I'm a never-breaster, too). Rest of the meal is perfectly balanced with the anchovies, butter, lemon and herbs. Extremely delicious. (I will say the croutons have more of a stuffing consistency than a salad crouton. I couldn't get them crispy.)hungryasianDC4/25/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titChicken BreastChickenPoultryPeaVegetableSpringWeeknight MealsEasyMainGluten-FreeNut-FreeHealthyishRoastDinnerRecipes you want to make.
