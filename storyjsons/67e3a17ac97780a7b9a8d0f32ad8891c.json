It was impossible to open the app without seeing a photo of the pit of rainbow sprinkles, edible candy balloons, or the seesaw in the shape of a giant scoop. This summer, you can expect the same but much, much bigger (and high-fructose-corn-syrup-ier), because the Museum of Candy is coming to New York City.The Museum of Candy, an offshoot of the Sugar Factory restaurant chain, is for everyone who didn\u2019t think the Museum of Ice Cream was Willy Wonka enough. As reported by Eater, this museum of sweets will be 30,000 square feet with 15 \u201cexperiential rooms\u201d themed around candy, a dessert market, a Sugar Factory branch, an outdoor cafe, and no shortage of exhibits. Said exhibits, according to Eater, will include candy murals, candy art installations, candy-tasting areas, a candy unicorn, and, allegedly, the world\u2019s largest gummy bear.\u201cThe idea to create a Museum of Candy originated from the imagination of my inquisitive children and my own personal dreams about a magical candy land,\u201d Charissa Davidovici, the founder of Sugar Factory, told Time Out. \u201cWe also drew inspiration from all of our guests at Sugar Factory taking pictures at our life-size Candy Dot wall and with our over-the-top food and drinks. New York City is the perfect location to open our first museum, it\u2019s the epicenter of entertainment\u2014we can\u2019t wait to share this concept worldwide.\u201dIt's not clear yet whether the Museum of Candy will be a pop-up exhibition like the Museum of Ice Cream, but Eater reports that there are similar plans to open a Los Angeles location and one in an as-yet-unspecified city. The New York location will be in Chelsea, at the building that formerly housed the Limelight nightclub and currently serves as Jue Lan Club, a high-end Chinese restaurant. Other than that, there\u2019s not much in terms of specs, but knowing the Sugar Factory's penchant for opulent, photogenic desserts, you should start preparing your Instagram no matter what.Or stay home and attempt to make homemade gushers instead:Explore Bon App\u00e9titNew YorkCandyTrends + NewsRecipes you want to make.
