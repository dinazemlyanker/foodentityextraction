When it comes to the wine, try Merlot for its softness and fruit-forward flavors\u2014but pretty much any decent bottle of red will do. Just be sure not to let the mixture boil; the barest of simmers will ensure plenty of flavor, but without boiling off all the alcohol.This mulled wine recipe can be made two hours ahead of serving. When you want to start sipping, just rewarm gently over medium-low heat.Editor\u2019s note: This recipe was originally published November 13, 2012.Ingredients12  Servings20whole cloves2tangerines, clementines, or small oranges2750-ml bottles Merlot3cups fresh apple cider8Lady apples (optional)2cinnamon sticks plus 8 for garnish (garnish optional)2green cardamom pods, cracked2cups tawny PortPreparationStep 1Press stem (pointed) end of 10 cloves into each tangerine, piercing through the skin.
