This recipe changed my mind.By Alyse WhitneySeptember 21, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailWhen I was a kid, pork chops were one thing: thin-cut, Shake \u2018n Baked, and dry. They were usually served with those boxed mashed potato flakes that my parents added water to in order to make them...mashed potato-ish. Suffice it to say, I thought I hated pork chops and mashed potatoes for most of my life. But then I had a transformative experience eating a Berkshire pork chop at Riverpark, one of Tom Colicchio\u2019s restaurants in New York City, about eight years ago. It was grilled with peaches and cipollini onions, perfectly pink in the middle, and incredibly juicy. I vowed then and there to start making pork chops at home, but it wasn\u2019t until...seven years later...that I actually did the damn thing.Our juicy pan-seared pork chop recipe was the ideal point of entry into pork chop cookery, because it has a built-in fail-safe for not overcooking the chops. Pork can get dry and tough very easily, even if you just accidentally leave it in the pan a few minutes after the heat is off. There are two nifty tricks with this recipe: You basically only cook the chops on one side and kiss them with heat on the other, and you smother them with delicious citrus vinaigrette after to really guarantee there is no shortage of juiciness and flavor. The dressing is made mostly of things you probably have on hand: lemon zest, juice, garlic, mustard, oregano, cumin, sugar, olive oil, and cilantro. I have made it without cilantro and it\u2019s fine, albeit a little less bright and herby.A little sugar helps things caramelize nicely.\nPhoto by Alex LauThere is another sneaky part of this recipe that ensures your meat caramelizes: a little sugar sprinkled over one side of the four \u00bd-inch-thick chops so they get as deeply bronzed as possible. This all happens quickly\u20145 minutes on the first side, 1 minute on the second, and a 10-minute rest in the skillet for carryover cooking\u2014giving you time to roast vegetables, make a pot of rice, or dress a salad, depending on how lazy you are. OH, AND THE BEST PART: you whisk the pan juices from the pork into the dressing! Everything in life should be more porky.PAN JUICES IN THE DRESSING, HELL YEAH.\nPhoto by Alex LauSince I am a single woman who lives in a studio apartment by myself, I usually just make two pork chops. But if I want leftovers for lunches throughout the week, I make extras, slice them up after they\u2019ve rested, and make rice bowls. I\u2019ve found that if you just zap the pork in the microwave for a minute or less, it doesn\u2019t overcook and get dry or rubbery. But it is just as good tucked into summer rolls or on top of a salad. Also: Make extra citrus dressing. It goes great on Bibb lettuce with crunchy vegetables and sliced pork.Pork chops still aren\u2019t my everyday weeknight dinner, but whenever I get a craving, I know I\u2019m only 15 minutes away from the juiciest ones ever. Now I am going to send this recipe to my mom, who may still Shake \u2018n Bake for her and my dad, and hopefully start a new Whitney family tradition.Get the recipe:Juicy Pan-Seared Pork Chops with Citrus DressingRather than marinating ahead of time, which, let\u2019s face it, doesn\u2019t work on weeknights, we came up with a citrus-mustard-cilantro dressing that bathes the chops in punchy flavor.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyPorkPork ChopNever FailRead MoreJuicy Pan-Seared Pork Chops with Citrus Dressingtest-kitchen4 Weeknight Dinners You Can Throw Together After WorkBy Adam RapoportRecipes you want to make.
