Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you\u2019ll get the scoop before everyone else.Dear Healthyish friends,Every year I dream about all the perfectly ripe tomatoes and peaches I imagine I\u2019ll be eating come August. But when that time (i.e., right now) arrives, I have so much pent-up anticipation that I buy more than I can reasonably eat, and a few of the tomatoes and peaches inevitably end up bruised and shriveled on my kitchen counter.Peaches and tomatoes are the most delicate, but they\u2019re far from the only things I tend to over-buy this time of year (see eggplant, green beans, peppers, lettuces...). I\u2019ve done this for so many years now that I\u2019ve fully accepted I will never buy less produce. So I\u2019ve embarked on the next-best solution, which is to experiment with all the different ways to extend my market haul for as long as possible.If I have a glut of fruit that\u2019s in danger of overripening, I\u2019ve gotten into the habit of making quick stovetop compotes, which require little more than some cut-up fruit, a splash of water, a bit of sweetener like maple syrup or sugar, and whatever spices you desire, and maybe a hit of acid like fresh lemon juice for brightness. If I make a cup or two of compote on a Sunday, I\u2019ll store it in the fridge and then stir it into overnight oats or yogurt or spread it on toast for breakfast the rest of the week.This Corn & Chickpea Bowl with Miso-Jalape\u00f1o Tahini is an excellent way to use produce.\nCopyright 2020. All rights reserved.When I have tons of crunchy vegetables like green beans, beets of any color, carrots, or onions, I\u2019ll make a quick pickle that\u2019ll last for awhile in the fridge, ready to dress up any sandwich or salad. I\u2019ve been making variations on a big lunch salad all summer with lettuce, tender herbs, cubed avocado, some marinated lentils, and a handful of crunchy fresh pickles. I usually riff on the extensive guide to quick-pickling in Joshua McFadden\u2019s timeless book Six Seasons, but right now I\u2019ve got my eye on Lani Halliday\u2019s Spicy Pickled Summer Beans, which I plan to make as soon as I finish a few of the...seven jars of pickles I currently have in the fridge.And when I\u2019m not compote-ing or pickling my produce, I\u2019m probably freezing it for later. If you\u2019ve been reading this newsletter, you know I\u2019m an unabashed freezer stan. In the September issue of the magazine (out now) you\u2019ll find a big feature on all the lessons we\u2019ve learned from cooking nonstop these past few months in quarantine, including a story on how to conquer your freezer once and for all. In it, I wax poetic about my new favorite way to blanch, squeeze, and freeze bunches of leafy greens. Any fruit that doesn\u2019t become compote goes into the freezer in a single layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet; once it\u2019s solid, I bag it up for future smoothies or frozen treats like this incredibly delicious Peach Sorbet With Crushed Blackberries. And ever since I read about Samantha Seneviratne\u2019s Yogurt and Jam Pops over on NYT Cooking, I\u2019ve found myself online shopping for ice-pop molds. (I am most definitely taking recommendations.)Happy preserving,Christina ChaeyAssociate editorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishWhat's Chaey Cooking?essayRead MoreguideThe Healthyish Farmers' Market ChallengeRecipes you want to make.
