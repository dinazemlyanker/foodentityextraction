She's given us her best meal prep tips before, and here she talks about how she uses molcajetes to make the best salsas\u2014and to connect to her past.Growing up in Southern California in an Hispanic family,\u00a0molcajetes\u00a0were just around. I never thought much of them other than that I found them intimidating. They\u2019re these heavy, imposing kitchen tools made of volcanic rock, and I thought, \u201cOh, grandmas use that, but I can\u2019t.\u201dThen I met [my partner] Alec [Morisson], and we spent a month together in the Yucatan. Seeing women work their\u00a0molcajetes\u00a0so skillfully there made them even more intimidating to me, but I was also fascinated. These tools have been in continuous use across Mesoamerican cultures for thousands of years, and they\u2019re still produced the way they always have been: Men go on these long journeys to find veins of porous, volcanic rock, they test pieces of it, and, if they find what they like, they remove chunks and carry them back. It\u2019s a bit of an art form\u2014both making them and using them.I read somewhere that they were originally used as a flint, and then it was discovered that they could break down things like spices and corn and it kind of evolved from there. It\u2019s funny: One Mayan guy works in our kitchen and he\u2019ll use the edge of a\u00a0molcajete\u00a0to strike a flame. He\u2019s real old school.I have a small one that I bought on that trip, and then I added four more over time. I use my larger ones for making salsa and my smaller ones for making chili paste or cracking spices. The rough texture makes shearing the skins of slick chilies or even a blistered tomato go much faster. It also releases oils from ingredients, which is why blender salsa will never taste as good as if it were made with a molcajete.A new\u00a0molcajete\u00a0is much like a fresh cast-iron pan: There\u2019s a little bit of work that goes into seasoning it, but it\u2019s worth it. The traditional way is to grind raw rice into a powder to extract any bits of grit in its walls. And when you rinse it, the rice kind of pulls everything behind it. Next, you pound some garlic and salt into it. Eventually the bowl becomes layered with flavor from all the previous things you made in it.Alec and I are trying to go to Oaxaca soon. I\u2019m already looking into a bigger suitcase, so I can bring more\u00a0molcajetes\u00a0back. It allows you to be part of that big, ancient cuisine, and that\u2019s really cool.Sanchez\u2019s Carrot-Chile SalsaCrush a bit of piloncillo (unrefined cane sugar), then toss with a bunch of peeled medium carrots and olive oil and roast on a rimmed baking sheet in a 425\u00b0 oven until carrots are browned. Meanwhile, toast 6 unpeeled cloves of garlic, 1 sliced onion, and a few whole habaneros in a dry skillet until blackened on all sides. Stem habaneros, peel garlic, chop onion, and simmer in a saucepan with apple cider vinegar and water. Then mash it all in the molcajete until it has a salsa-like texture.Can't make it to Mexico? Sanchez also loves her 10\" molcajete from williams-sonoma.com ($60).Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishToolsMexicanCooking TipsShoppingRead MoreshoppingThe Tool That Changed the Way I CookBy Andy BaraghaniRecipes you want to make.
