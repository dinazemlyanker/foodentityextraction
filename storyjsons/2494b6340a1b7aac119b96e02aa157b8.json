Chef Antonin Mousseau-Rivard turns seasonal ingredients into a mindblowing 12-course tasting menu at Le Mousso.ORDER THE: tasting menu, which changes with the seasons and also accommodates dietary restrictions (just call ahead). We highly recommended the wine pairing, in which sommelier Alexis Demers presents with enthusiasm, skill, and total lack of pretension (he\u2019ll also graciously pour a half pairing if the whole shebang feels like too much). But if you\u2019re not down for the multi-hour time commitment (and $190 CAD per person price tag), you can snag a spot next door at Le Petit Mousso, the more casual sister restaurant.THE VIBE IS: industrial minimalism meets midcentury modern, with some earthy ceramics and a couple of Scandi-inspired touches. You don\u2019t really need to dress up in Montreal, but why not go all the way at Le Mousso?PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Wednesday to Saturday, with seating at 6 p.m. There is only one seating every night, so reservations are required (available via its website).\u2014Claire SaffitzPhoto by Dominique LafondPhoto by Dominique LafondWE ALSO LOVEAgrikolIn the Gay Village, a rum-fueled oasis run by Arcade Fire DamasAll the meze (and fresh pita!) at this standout Syrian spot in OutremontLo\u00efcAll roads (and great p\u00e9t-nat) lead to this Saint-Henri wine barExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
