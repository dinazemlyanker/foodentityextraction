Then, with the help of La Cocina, she turned her mother\u2019s beef patty recipe into a citywide sensation.By Hilary CadiganJanuary 7, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Laura Murray, Food Styling by Yekaterina BoystovaFacebookTwitterEmailIf you visited the Jones family household anytime in the late \u201980s or \u201990s, you might have found a Jamaican beef patty shoved in between the sofa cushions. Or under someone\u2019s pillow. Or tucked into a bookshelf. These are the measures that must be taken when one lives in a house with eight siblings, two grandparents, any number of visiting aunts and uncles, and a mother who can only roll out 24 of her famously flaky, juicy, meat-stuffed, turmeric-tinged patties at a time. (Which may sound like a lot, but do the math.)\u201cLook, I\u2019m number seven of the siblings,\u201d says Shani Jones. \u201cWhen you\u2019re one of the youngest, you have to either stick up for yourself\u2014or hide your patties. So I hid mine under the couch.\u201dThese days, Shani no longer needs to squirrel away her patties. Instead, she makes them herself, using an industrial grade Hobart mixer and a dough sheeter that can roll out 250 at a time. The recipe is the backbone of her catering company, Peaches Patties, named in honor of Shani\u2019s mother, Victoria Jones, a.k.a Peaches.But shortages still happen. Shani\u2019s company is one of the only Jamaican food purveyors in San Francisco, and the beef patties are the most popular item on her menu.Shani Jones of Peaches Patties\nPhoto by Eric WolfingerThe story of the Jones family patty recipe begins before Shani was even born. Her father, Martin, left his hometown of New Orleans at the end of the Great Migration, heading west to San Francisco. Her mother, Victoria, was a nursing student in Trenchtown, Jamaica. The two met through a penpal company. \u201cIt was like eHarmony or Match.com back in the day,\u201d Shani says. \u201cMy mom had penpals in Senegal, in Cuba, all over. But she and my dad really clicked, so one day, he decided to come out and visit her in Jamaica.\u201dOne trip was all it took. Six months later, Victoria had relocated to San Francisco. She married Martin and never looked back. But she brought her patty recipe with her, handed down from her own mother, and raised her eight children in a house suffused with Jamaican culture and cooking.Jerk chicken, fried plantains, peas and rice, beef patties: These were the flavors of Shani\u2019s childhood, but home felt like an island of sorts, in the middle of a city largely devoid of Caribbean community. \u201cEven today, there\u2019s not much of a Jamaican diaspora out here,\u201d she says. \u201cMost of it is on the East Coast.\u201dGrowing up, Shani did her best to assimilate with an outside world that differed largely from her interior one. She got good grades, made friends, followed the rules. But it wasn\u2019t easy; cultivating emotional barriers became a survival tactic. \u201cBlack people here are marginalized,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are looked at and treated differently. In order to keep on functioning, you need a certain degree of numbness.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t until she moved across the country for college that Shani saw things could be different. Studying Mass Communications at the historically black Clark Atlanta University, she found a vastly different community, where black people held positions of power\u2014professors, doctors, politicians\u2014and Caribbean culture thrived. Even Atlanta\u2019s grocery stores were better, with shelves upon shelves packed with jerk seasoning and Scotch bonnets and bottles of Pickapeppa sauce.After graduation, Shani visited her mother\u2019s home country for the first time. \u201cAs soon as I got off the plane in Kingston and went outside, I don\u2019t know what it was, but it rushed over me,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI felt this calmness. Like, wow, okay, I\u2019m home.\u201d She ate patties at a local shop and visited her ancestral stomping grounds\u2014the verdant Saint Elizabeth countryside where her grandmother grew up, her mother\u2019s high school and community theatre and nursing academy in Trenchtown.\u201cJamaica was an awakening moment for me,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t numb anymore. I was grieving for the first time, that disconnection I grew up with. I never knew that I could actually feel that relaxed before.\u201dWhen she returned to San Francisco, Shani was determined to regain this sense of connection. \u201cI came back and realized there was still no Jamaican food outside my mom\u2019s house,\u201d she recalls. So, while pursuing a PhD in Organizational Leadership and Management and driving for Lyft, she returned to her mother\u2019s kitchen to recreate some of her family\u2019s classic recipes\u2014juicy jerk chicken thighs, veggies stewed in creamy coconut curry, and of course, the famous beef patties. But this time, they weren\u2019t just for family. They were for friends, then strangers. Small events, then larger ones. As word spread, so did demand.\u201cI started having casual conversations while I was doing Lyft rides,\u201d Shani says. People would ask her if she did rideshares full time. \u201cNo,\u201d she\u2019d tell them, opening up about her PhD, her fledgling business, her struggle to balance it all with a gig economy salary and San Francisco\u2019s rapidly rising cost of living. \u201cWithin those conversations, three separate times, people asked me: Have you heard of La Cocina?\u201dShe had not. But a bit of Googling led to a free orientation workshop, which led to an application, which led to an acceptance. And suddenly, Shani was a member of one of the country\u2019s most successful nonprofit food incubators, an organization dedicated to helping Bay Area women, immigrants and people of color to open their own successful businesses.Our BA Cookbook Club pick for January 2020!\nPhoto by Laura MurrayThrough La Cocina, Shani learned how to brand her business. She moved production out of her mother\u2019s kitchen\u2014a space she\u2019d outgrown\u2014and into La Cocina\u2019s shared industrial kitchen space. There, a pastry chef taught her how to scale up the patty recipe, from batches of 24 to 250. And it was La Cocina that helped Shani find a retail space: a kiosk at 331 Cortland Marketplace in Bernal Heights, sidled up against other food sellers from all over the world, many of them fellow graduates of La Cocina.\u201cWith La Cocina, I\u2019ve been able to get more help than I would\u2019ve on my own as far as navigating this industry,\u201d says Shani. \u201cJust having a space to start and grow my business, and people versed in the field who could meet me where I needed them the most\u2014that\u2019s what helped me grow and flourish.\u201dOn December 23, the Marketplace shut down due to rising rents\u2014a problem that\u2019s become devastatingly familiar to restaurateurs all over San Francisco. But Shani is undaunted. Business still booms, and she\u2019ll keep running her catering business\u2014alongside her nine-person staff\u2014from La Cocina\u2019s shared kitchen.Meanwhile, her beef patty recipe, along with her family\u2019s origin story and her jerk chicken, is now featured along with 80-something other recipes from fellow La Cocina grads in the organization\u2019s beautiful new cookbook, We Are La Cocina. \u201cIn this book, I was able to actually tell my story, to show who I am, to share my rich heritage of being American but raised the Jamaican way,\u201d says Shani. \u201cAll of the recipes in this book are tacit knowledge, written down on paper to make them explicit knowledge for everyone else.\u201dEventually, La Cocina will help Shani and her staff find a new, larger, standalone restaurant space, where platters of oxtail curry and tangy escovitch snapper will share a menu with her husband\u2019s misir wot, a spicy red lentil stew from his own home country of Ethiopia. It will be a nucleus of community, for anyone who needs it.And occasionally Peaches herself will pop by\u2014incognito, of course; she\u2019s a celebrity now\u2014to stock up on a few dozen of those famous beef patties.Buy it: We Are La Cocina, $19 on AmazonAll products featured on bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
