Any time of day is now easily converted into an opportune moment to pop by the counter-service bakery and restaurant: a seeded morning bun for breakfast, a pear crostata and espresso pick-me-up, or a pizza rosso snack to-go. Leo has strong pizza lineage: Co-owner Mike Fadem is also a co-owner of Ops, one of Brooklyn\u2019s best pizza restaurants, and his partner Joey Scalabrino was formerly the chef there. But, I must confess, it\u2019s the assortment of ripassata that I can\u2019t get enough of.As per Italian tradition, ripassata is the method of taking toothsome vegetables and breaking down their fibrous stems until they\u2019re pleasant enough to eat (ripassare means to go over again). Often the technique is used to tame greens, like spigarello or broccoli leaves, that would otherwise be discarded or that can\u2019t be digested properly if consumed raw. Leo has perfected the art with dishes like peppers and broccolini doused in olive oil or fioretto cauliflower with Calabrian chili and fennel seeds.Mike Fadem and Joey Scalabrino in a booth at Leo.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanThe idea for Leo came about over the course of the two owners\u2019 travels around Europe, to caf\u00e9s like Lille Bakery in Copenhagen, Panificio Bonci in Rome, and Flor in London\u2014neighborhood places that are worth planning a trip around. \u201cBesides being obsessed with pizza and bread, Mike and I love vegetables more than anything,\u201d Scalabrino explains, \u201cCicoria ripassata when we go to Rome or saut\u00e9ed snow pea shoots when we eat in Chinatown: We think these kinds of things go perfectly with pizza.\u201dWe got the lowdown on how Fadem and Scalabrino coax even the most stubborn produce into ripassata. And since ripassata is more of a state of mind than it is a recipe, trusting in your ability to taste is key. But there\u2019s no need to sweat if your R&D goes awry: \u201cYou can always turn it into soup,\u201d jokes Scalabrino.Get cozy with your produce\u201cThe most important thing is to learn the vegetable itself,\u201d says Fadem. In the winter, look out for broccoli rabe or spigarello, and, come summer, go for eggplant or bell peppers. After hitting the farmers market, assess your raw produce of choice for bitterness and mouthfeel. Then, pick one of the myriad of options such as blanching, saute\u00e9ing, roasting, or boiling.If you\u2019re unsure of the best path forward, test a small amount of the vegetable in a pot of salted water: \u201cTry to boil a little bit to find the right texture,\u201d he says, \u201cyou want to find the pleasure spot for that particular vegetable.\u201dThere\u2019s no such thing as overcookedWhen working with tough winter vegetables, overcooking is never a bad thing. Don\u2019t be afraid to make mistakes, Fadem encourages. When roasting, blasting high heat for a short amount of time usually does the trick\u2014try 500 degrees for 10 minutes to start but don\u2019t stray too far from your oven in the meantime. For blanching, 3 minutes in salted, boiling water is a solid starting point for most greens; adjust time depending on the stem\u2019s thickness.Let the EVOO flowThe trick to tender, glistening vegetables is using copious amounts of olive oil before, during, and after cooking. It\u2019s important to pick your olive oil wisely and invest in a high-quality product that will add flavor. \u201cRight now, we get ours from Cantina Giardino, a winemaker in Campania,\u201d Fadem says. \u201cIt\u2019s really smooth but also spicy and fruity.\u201d Check out Italian specialty purveyors like Gustiamo and Archestratus for hefty tins from vetted producers.Acid equals vibranceFinish your vegetables with acid, either in the form of citrus or vinegar, to add brightness. Acid also helps soften the vegetables and makes them last longer.\u201cWe\u2019re working with a couple purveyors that bring in unique, well-made red and white wine vinegars,\u201d says Fadem,\u201dThey have a real depth of flavor that\u2019s kind of the secret to a lot of our favorite salads.\u201d Scalabrino recommends reaching for winter citrus such as Meyer lemons or Sumo oranges to achieve the same effect. Use both the zest and juice for extra zip.Add a kick\u201cNot all spices are created equal,\u201d says Scalabrino, which is why he goes for Burlap & Barrel\u2019s ethically sourced single origin blends. Peperoncino, fennel seeds, and dried herbs should all be within arm\u2019s reach. To add a different texture and taste, toss in roasted pine nuts, raisins or crushed hazelnuts.Stage a second act\u201cWe want to make simple food that can sit over time and be served quickly,\u201d says Scalabrino, \u201cso a lot of these things taste better many hours or even a day after they\u2019ve been prepared.\u201d To shake up any leftover ripassata, throw the veggies between thick slices of sourdough or on top of a pizza, or turn them into a companion for pasta.Three Leo combinations to try at home:#1. Winter Greens + Calabrian ChiliBlanch chicories, collard greens, kale, or other tough winter greens in salted water for about three minutes or until crunch is gone. Ring dry. Saut\u00e9 with olive oil and Calabrian chili. Dress with lemon juice, lots of olive oil, and salt to taste.#2. Peppers + BroccoliniToss peppers and broccolini in salt and olive oil. Roast in the oven at 500 degrees for about 10 minutes or until char begins to form. Add water as needed to keep from drying out. Dress with red wine vinegar and more olive oil. Season with crushed fennel seeds and fresh lemon when served.#3. Turnips + Dandelion Green PestoToss turnip wedges in salt and olive oil. Roast in the oven at 500 degrees for about 10 minutes. Dress with pesto made from dandelion greens, garlic and hazelnuts. Top with crushed hazelnuts and serve with whipped ricotta.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishRestaurantsBrooklynItalianRead MoreLifestyleThe Pizza Place We Can't Stop Going To...For the SaladBy Priya KrishnaRecipes you want to make.
