Here, that\u2019s thin slices of fresh lemon, some green chile, and sesame seeds (black or white). The cold brine keeps the cuke slices extra-crunchy. It\u2019s also our go-to method for pickling thinly sliced fennel, cauliflower florets, quartered radishes, or thinly sliced celery.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Working on my 4th batchAnonymousWilliamsburg VA9/6/2021Boiling vinager + peppers basically mustard -gassed my home. Had to run the pot outside so everyone would stop coughing.Anonymous8/13/2021i really didnt like the flavor. it was not refreshing at all. tasted like watery soupRobinSan Francisco8/8/2021I made these and they are tasty, I used half the sugar and followed the rest of the recipe. Next time I will cut the lemons in 4\u2019s after thinly slicing so when I pour the brine there is more room for everything to wiggle around while waiting to be eaten.  I\u2019ll make this again and again! Diane \ud83d\udc1dSeattle 7/26/2021BEST PICKLES EVER!SaoirseDublin Ireland7/2/2021This was my first time trying to make pickles at home and wowza, I'm a convert!  They stayed so crispy and crunchy and were just a delight in sandwiches or stolen right out of the jar as a snack.  Love these!!Alyssa M.Bay Area, CA6/27/2021Similar method to a Swedish pickle recipe. Different spicing. Chilling the brine with ice first preserves the color and crunch of the cukes. I plan to try this recipe. Judyatthelake WI6/21/2021Just a heads-up to anyone making this, you'll need more than 1 quart jar for this recipe. The brine itself measures over 1 quart before adding the cucumber.Ryan NibSouth Lake Tahoe, CA6/2/2021Clearly the prior reviewer cannot read much. Lemme highlight. . . .\n\"Let cool. Pour brine over cucumbers in jar; cover and chill. \"Anonymous5/31/2021The recipe specifies cucumber slices at 1/2\u201d thick, but the slices in the photo are no where near that thick. I would guess 1/8\u201d is more accurate?Jeff LopesLisbon, Portugal5/30/2021I haven't tried these yet but am super confused- the description is that they are a cold brine but the directions are to boil all of the ingredients for the brine- wouldn't that make it a traditional pickle brine?
