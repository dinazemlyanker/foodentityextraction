It changes seasonally, and the master sommelier and chef, Toru Okuda, gets amazing ingredients like mature wild eel, which is difficult to procure and very expensive. You can taste the difference. He often finishes savory courses with kuromutsu (black-throated perch), a bluefish with a high fat content that grills exceptionally well. Also of note: the slow-grilled lobster encased in sea urchin. Dining here is always memorable.\u201d\u2014David Kinch of Manresa in Los Gatos, CaliforniaPhoto by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneChef Toru Okuda of Ginza Kojyu.\nExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
