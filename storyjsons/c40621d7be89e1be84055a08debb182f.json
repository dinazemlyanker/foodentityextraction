I made a few adjustments to the recipe as I meal prep for one. 1) I doubled the dressing recipe and stirred the grated cheese right into it. I was able to refrigerate the dressing and use as needed. 2) I swapped chicories for hearts of romaine, which I cut in half lengthwise and seared cut-side-down in a hot dry pan. 3) I then spread the dressing over the charred lettuce and topped with saut\u00e9ed prawns. I ate the whole meal with a fork and steak knife five days in a row and didn't get sick of it once... So tasty!!!hannahawilsonCalgary, Alberta1/15/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladEndiveChicoryLeafy GreensVegetableEscaroleFris\u00e9eRadicchioWinterEasySideGluten-FreeNut-FreeHealthyishDinnerRecipes you want to make.
