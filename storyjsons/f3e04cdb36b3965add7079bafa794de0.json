But how did we get here?By  Khushbu ShahNovember 29, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Bryan FountainFacebookTwitterEmailIndia is home to 1.3 billion people, and lately, it seems, 1.3 billion wellness trends. In the past year and a half, even people disinterested in health crazes are unable to avoid the golden tsunami of turmeric drinks, the proliferation of ghee and coconut oil in grocery stores, and headlines about how khichdi is the magically detoxing concoction you need right now. Everyone can spell ashwagandha, and Ayurveda, India\u2019s thousands-of-years-old holistic healing system, is now an Instagram hashtag with over a million posts (many of them featuring white women). To put it simply, Indian food has become the darling of the health world.It\u2019s a radical shift from Indian food\u2019s long-standing reputation in the West of being the spicy, cream-laden, junky takeout that would stain your nails, make your clothes smell, and give you inevitable stomach issues. So how did the perception of Indian food swing from diarrhea to detox?Basu Ratnam in Inday, the fast-casual mini-chain he founded in NYC.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig\u201cGwyneth Paltrow,\u201d says Basu Ratnam with a laugh when I posed this question. Ratnam is the owner of Inday, a restaurant with multiple locations in New York City that melds his passion for health with his Indian upbringing. While Paltrow\u2014who was an avid yoga enthusiast before she became the Goop queen\u2014can\u2019t take full credit for the rise of turmeric tonics and khichdi cleanses, Ratnam is correct to point to a certain, ahem, limber set of people as the catalysts of change.\u201cThe same philosophy that gave us yoga also talked about mindfulness, meditation, and Ayurvedic eating,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the interest in it is a natural evolution.\u201dYoga, which originated in India, became a phenomenon in the West more than a decade ago. The practice is deeply connected to meditation, which has made its way into our everyday lives via mobile apps, airline entertainment, and seemingly every TED talk about how to be a successful entrepreneur. Hygiene routines like oil pulling, using a tongue scraper, and dry brushing were touted by (mostly white) wellness influencers, and retailers like CAP Beauty and Goop started capitalizing on the trend.When health is a multitrillion-dollar industry, turmeric becomes much more than a sickness remedy.Sana Javeri Kadri, the founder of spice company Diaspora Co., sees the rise of Ayurveda, a term that wouldn\u2019t so easily roll off tongues in the West just a few years ago, as connected to the popularity of yoga. \u201cI think people who have access to seeing Indian food through the lens of Ayurveda are people who are into yoga, or some form of appropriated Indian culture,\u201d she says.True Ayurveda is a labyrinthine set of rules and guidelines, but there are aspects that are extremely approachable, like not eating late at night, avoiding combinations of certain foods, or using spices such as turmeric to treat ailments. These principles are so woven into the fabric of everyday routines in South Asian culture, both on the subcontinent and in the diaspora, that many don\u2019t realize they are actively participating in it. \u201cI always thought I was someone who grew up without Ayurveda,\u201d says Kadri. \u201cBut it was more that it was so a part of our daily lives that we never considered it a health thing.\u201dBut when health is a multitrillion-dollar industry, turmeric becomes much more than a sickness remedy. It\u2019s in skin care and on clothes, in chocolate, eggs, drink mixes, and snacks, and, seeing this success, the industry has begun to fetishize other common Ayurvedic ingredients. Ghee, coconut oil, ashwagandha, and moringa have all ridden in on turmeric\u2019s gold coattails. It\u2019s only helped that today\u2019s fad diets like paleo, keto, and Whole30 demonize dairy and gluten, which are easily avoided in Indian cooking, and valorize fats like ghee and coconut.We\u2019re more skeptical than ever before about Western medicine, and so we look to other resources and cultures for the remedies we need.The West also has a new obsession with \u201cplant-based\u201d eating, essentially a term for veganism but without the militant connotation, which has buttressed this interest in Indian food and Ayurveda, says Vandana Sheth, a registered dietitian and a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. While neither Indian cuisine nor Ayurveda are completely meatless approaches to eating, it\u2019s extremely simple to find vegetarian and non-dairy options that are \u201cflavorful and healthy,\u201d adds Sheth.One thing that all these diets, Ayurveda, and the wellness movement as a whole have in common is that they all understand food to be medicine. We\u2019re more skeptical than ever before about Western medicine\u2014our ability to access it and its ability to heal us\u2014and so we look to other resources and cultures for the remedies we need. Traditional Chinese medicine, which has long had a foothold in the Western world via techniques like acupuncture and massage, has seen its popularity expand along with the wellness trend.But, as Kadri points out, Ayurveda is perhaps less intimidating to Westerners because it centers around more recognizable foods, while navigating the complex series of herbs and supplements that make up the framework of Chinese medicine is more challenging. \u201cMost Ayurveda websites are also in English,\u201d she adds.Some Indians in America, like Ratnam, are excited to see the West embrace Indian traditions. \u201cI think it is validating,\u201d he says. He was once told that opening an Indian restaurant, especially a healthy one, was a terrible idea. \u201cI think it means that there is some integrity to the belief, and I think that it is really exciting.  There\u2019s a consensus that these Indian philosophies are good.\u201d Others, like Nik Sharma, author of the cookbook Season, are more cautious. \u201cIt\u2019s important that Indian food and culture doesn\u2019t get pigeonholed into wellness,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is so much more to it, but learning about Indian food from wellness is such a niche perspective.\u201dKadri agrees that she may have never started her company, which currently sells turmeric sourced directly from one farm in India, had it not been for the golden latte trend. While most of her customers are home cooks, she also sells to wellness brands like Golde, the turmeric latte blend that Paltrow drinks. But she\u2019s more ambivalent than Ratnam. She struggles with people like Amanda Chantal Bacon, the controversial and oft-profiled white founder of L.A.-based Moon Juice, a smoothie shop that has spun out into an empire of products using ingredients popular in both Chinese medicine and Ayurveda.A khichdi from chef Divya Alter of Divya's Kitchen in NYC.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Styling by Sue LiTopics of ownership and appropriation are unavoidable when talking about the wellness world\u2019s fondness for Indian food and practices. \u201cAyurveda has become so deeply co-opted,\u201d says Kadri. She finds the conversation around khichdi, a rice-and-lentil based dish popular across India, particularly taxing. Over the past year or so, several publications have run articles by slender white women proselytizing the \u201ckitchari cleanses\u201d they have embarked on\u2014frequently misspelling the dish (no one from India would ever pronounce it \u201ckitchari\u201d), offering up recipes that no Indian would consider to be khichdi, and, most importantly, failing to acknowledge the dish\u2019s Indian origins.It\u2019s not that Kadri isn\u2019t happy to see people from around the world eating khichdi. \u201cI think that everybody should eat khichdi if it makes them feel better,\u201d says Kadri. \u201cI just have a huge issue with someone taking credit for a khichdi recipe.\u201d It\u2019s a frustration many South Asians have felt as these ingredients have been usurped by the West. In many ways, it\u2019s food colonization.The cherry-picking of Ayurvedic tenants is worrying to Kadri. \u201cThis is just normal food for a lot of people, so suddenly wrapping it up as a superfood with magical properties is just gimmicky,\u201d she says. Ratnam is also concerned about what this selectiveness means from a health perspective. \u201cPeople in America are always looking for quick-fix solutions, and I think this is contrary to what the true philosophy of Ayurveda is about,\u201d he says. To him, Ayurveda means creating balance and intention. Plates of ghee-roasted meat with tall glasses of \u201cgolden milk\u201d for every meal isn\u2019t that.Sheth also warns against viewing Indian wellness trends as miracle fixes. \u201cWhen it comes to fat, I encourage my clients to still be mindful of portions,\u201d she says. And on the subject of khichdi, Sheth says there\u2019s nothing detoxing about it. \u201cIt can be a healthy meal as it provides carbs, protein, and some fat, but our body has wonderful organs that are designed to help with getting rid of toxins,\u201d she says.But Ratnam continues to be optimistic about the role of Indian food stateside. \u201cAmerica is definitely getting browner, and I think people are embracing spicier food more,\u201d he says. He just hopes that Indians can own and lead this moment in the health space. After all, he says, \u201cIndia was 5,000 years early to the wellness movement.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titIndianHealthyishTrendsRead MoreLifestyleI Grew Up Eating This Common Indian Vegetable.
