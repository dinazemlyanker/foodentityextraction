I\u2019m talking burrata with plums. Cantaloupe with olive oil. And this new recipe for Cucumber and Melon Salad with Chile and Honey, which is truly the only way I want to eat melon for the rest of the summer.As is the case with roughly 40 percent of the recipes I cook, this salad was born from the mind of senior food editor Claire Saffitz. It\u2019s the kind of salad that seems WAY fancier and difficult to make than it is, but it\u2019s just shaving some strips of cucumber and melon and cheese, toasting nuts, and whisking together a very simple spicy-salty-sweet dressing to pour over it all. (And if you\u2019re currently living in an air-condition-less kitchen like me, you can buy roasted pistachios and skip turning on the oven altogether.)Yep, you need one.\nPhoto by Ted CavanaughThere is one tool that will make preparing this salad infinitely easier, and, yes, it is a mandoline. Like many other BA staffers, I am really about that Benriner mandoline life. My parents had one of these around when I was growing up and then I had to buy my own when I worked as a line cook, so it\u2019s become second nature for me to reach for one in my home kitchen. But I get that they're kind of...alarmingly sharp and scary. (Though I will say in the entire time I spent professionally cooking, the only time I required stitches was when I sliced off the corner of my right index finger off with a dull knife!!! Way more critical in my opinion to make sure your knives stay nice and sharp.) Anecdotally, I know a lot of people who opt for this smaller Oxo Good Grips hand-held mandoline slicer with a finger guard because they find the Benriner a bit too large and intimidating.Once you\u2019re outfitted with a mandoline, go for melon and cucumber planks that aren't too paper-thin like the way we tend to shave radishes for salads. The melon and cukes will release some liquid and lose a bit of crunchiness after they\u2019re dressed; you want the planks to have some heft to them so they don\u2019t get droopy once they\u2019re tossed in the dressing. You\u2019ll also use the mandoline to shave some ricotta salata, aka pressed, salted, and dried fresh ricotta. For that, you\u2019ll want to set the blade width to a slightly wider setting so the cheese doesn\u2019t crumble and instead shaves into smooth sheets.Ever since I first tried this salad, it has actually felt weird to me to eat melon without some form of salt in the mix. I say this as I am eating my second whole melon of the season, which I have blanketed in chile flakes and sea salt and lime juice and 10/10 would eat again. With melon season finally upon us, it\u2019s time to grab a handful of Diamond kosher salt and MAKE IT HAPPEN, people!Get the recipe:Cucumber and Melon Salad with Chile and HoneyConsider this salad more supporting evidence that, yes, you need a mandoline in your life.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCucumberMelonSaladSummerRead MoreCantaloupe and Cucumber SaladSavory Peach and Cucumber SaladcookingYou\u2019re Gonna Try This Fruit Salad and You\u2019re Gonna Love ItBy Carla Lalli MusicRecipes you want to make.
