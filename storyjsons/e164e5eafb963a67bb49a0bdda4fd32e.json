Sarah Santa Monica2/28/2022I make this a few times a year for winter holiday meals - it's simple, scalable, delicious, and a crowd-pleaser (across dietary choices)! Because silken tofu is creamy, yet mild and light, the spinach shines, which I think is an improvement over dairy-based creamed dishes. The aromatics enhance the brightness of the dish, and it pairs nicely with heavier traditional holiday dishes by cutting through the richness. For those accustomed to a thicker cream, I found that a little cornstarch slurry stirred in at the end does the trick, and it still reheats beautifully.
