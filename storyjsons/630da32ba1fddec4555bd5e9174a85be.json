Keep in mind: I am from Dallas. But it\u2019s also like no other restaurant I\u2019ve ever eaten at. Here, in this city of flashy Tex-Mex joints and big box chains, is a place where the main event is the inventive things in jars that sit idly on shelves lining the restaurants. They are concoctions sprung from the mind of chef/owner Misti Norris, who fell in love with fermentation as a kid\u2014she had good family and friends who loved pickling and preserving all kinds of vegetables and seafood.On a recent night at Petra and the Beast, there was one jar containing lilac bitters, another labeled \u201cmustang sunflower soda,\u201d and yet another housing differently colored carrots marinating in an herb-y brine. The results of these fermentation experiments are what give brightness and complexity to the restaurant\u2019s burnt potato terrine, crispy chicken feet, and malfatti with pork ragout. The short chalkboard menu changes frequently, but it\u2019s usually broken down into \u201cMeatums,\u201d or meats, \u201cNoods\u201d (you can figure that one out), and anything else that Norris happens to be excited about\u2014and pretty much everything features some kind of fermented element. Here, Norris is testing the bounds of fermentation, with wildly flavorful consequences. Case in point: She told me that she recently preserved Texas potatoes with shio koji, garlic, snapper bone salt (yes, you can apparently make salt out of fish bones), and shrimp powder. \u201cThe result was a bottarga-ish texture, super smoky, fishy, dried truffle looking thing,\u201d she says. Yeah, I\u2019d eat that.Go there: Petra and the BeastExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsDallasRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
