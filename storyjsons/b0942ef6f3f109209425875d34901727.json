I nap on my parents\u2019 couch. I eat as many hoagies as I possibly can. And I go to Kensington\u2019s Martha and drink a bottle of Va La Vineyard\u2019s Silk Rosato.This is the bottle of wine I look forward to every summer, and it\u2019s special for a couple of reasons. The first is that I\u2019ve made drinking this wine in this place a tradition. Sitting in Martha\u2019s beautiful tiered yard with a friend or two, as the sun shines down, and watching that stark white label being carried toward my large granite table reminds me that I am home and that I am happy.The other reason is that this wine is masterfully made, tantalizing, and singular. Va La\u2019s Silk is a rosato that can hold its own against quite literally any other natural ros\u00e9 in any respectable wine bar in the world. Bonus: It\u2019s made in my native state of Pennsylvania. The wine is a blend of mainly Corvina Veronese, Nebbiolo, and Barbera\u2014all Italian grapes, usually used for more substantial wines\u2014which give it a brilliant garnet hue. Flavor-wise, it\u2019s somewhere between the lively, wild natural wines I drink at my favorite bars in New York and the more traditional, reserved California Chardonnay and Italian Chianti I drink at my parents\u2019 house. It\u2019s both elegant and exciting, and the result is a wine that\u2019s equal parts South Philly black cherry water ice and flinty Pennsylvania soil, with bright fruit, lots of acid, and just enough tannin to keep it all in check.Simply (and maybe surprisingly) put: This rosato made in Pennsylvania is one of my favorite beverages in any category. So do as I do: Go to Philly. Grab a seat at Martha. And get a bottle of Silk, assuming that I haven\u2019t cleared out the cellar already.Go there: MarthaExplore Bon App\u00e9titWine BarsRoseHighly RecommendWineRead MorerestaurantsI Fully Endorse Tipsy Wine Shopping at Bar NormanBy Amiel StanekcultureI\u2019m Bad at Math But Can Tell You That This Lambrusco + Pizza = HappinessBy Emily SchultzcultureThe Halo-Halo at Philadelphia\u2019s Sarvida Is 5 Layers of PerfectionBy Amanda ShapirorestaurantsDon\u2019t Even Open the Menu at W/N W/N Coffee Bar\u201a Just Trust the BartendersBy Emily SchultzRecipes you want to make.
