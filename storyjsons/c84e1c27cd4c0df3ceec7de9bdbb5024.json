It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.I made this vegetarian galette a lot when it was first published, oh, four-and-a-half years ago. It has a flaky, whole-wheat crust (health halo!) and is filled wilted greens and caramelized mushrooms, with creamy ricotta atop and below. Imagine a savory pie bedazzled with all the flavors of a ravioli filling. Yes: I made it for potlucks. I made it for weekend dinner. I made it for brunch. I understood even then that I had a major advantage over most of our readers because I had gotten to taste-test it in the test kitchen before I made it at home (again and again). Risk-free cooking: I knew the recipe was a winner.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Turns out that convincing other people that they should drop everything and make a whole-wheat crust, then fill it with ricotta, saut\u00e9ed greens, and browned mushrooms before baking all those ingredients into a savory pie is a tougher proposition. That\u2019s where I come in!First of all: You\u2019re going to be eating so much meat between now and New Year\u2019s Day. Let\u2019s get some roughage in there.Second: The crust can be made in a food processor. Food processor! Ever heard of it? Dump in flours and salt. Add butter. Pulse, pulse, pulse. Add vinegar and ice water. Toss, toss. Smush into a disc. Badda bing, badda boom, you\u2019re done. (Also: If you don\u2019t have whole wheat flour, you can use 100 percent all-purpose.) That was the hard part, and it\u2019s already over!Shiitakes are a great mushroom for this galette.\nPhoto by Alex LauThird: Brown some mushrooms. I\u2019ll admit, I am not, repeat not a huge fan of those ordinary-looking button mushrooms in the photo, and would use some frilly oyster mushrooms, maitakes, or shiitakes for this, but for real, anything will work. A few minutes over medium-high heat with some olive oil, salt, and pepper is all you need. In the same pan, saut\u00e9 some garlic and Swiss chard (or kale, or spinach, or savoy cabbage) with a little garlic, salt, and pepper. That\u2019s it.Now: Roll out the dough (the recipe says to do this on floured parchment paper, which is a layer of fool-proofing that eliminates any possibility that the dough will stick to the countertop and makes it easy to get the dough onto the baking sheet). Onto the dough goes some ricotta. Then the greens and the \u2018shrooms, then more ricotta, and then you bake it.I like things that go in the oven for a few, because it allows a little window of time to put my tiny kitchen back together and wash whatever pots and pans I\u2019ve used. This is also a great time to tear some herbs and send someone you live with to the store to pick up a lemon\u2014that\u2019s the basis for a fresh herb salad for topping the earthy forest flavors happening in the galette.Strategically speaking, it would be overambitious and unrealistic to make the dough on the same night that you want to eat the galette. But maybe you work at home, so you can do this when you\u2019re procrastinating around lunch time. Maybe you\u2019re an actor-waiter or a group fitness instructor and you don\u2019t have to go to work till 4 o\u2019clock\u2014you have time during the day! If you\u2019re a teenager who loves to cook, get the dough ready when you get home from school and let it chill till your parents get home from work and the rest of the family will love you, unless they hate vegetables in which case the entire galette is yours! Or you can do this first step on the weekend and then swing right into your veg-forward dinner another night of the week. I\u2019m just trying to cover all the bases here.A fried egg on top turns a slice of galette into a full meal.\nPhoto by Ted CavanaughIf a slice of veggie pie is not your idea of dinner, make this your side dish. Or bulk it up by serving it with a fried egg on top. Cut it into thin wedges and tell people it\u2019s an appetizer. There are a lot of reasons to make pie for dinner. The number one reason for not doing it is because you haven\u2019t had it before, and once you get over the hump, you won\u2019t have that excuse. I hope I\u2019ve been convincing. If not, the galette will speak for itself.Get the recipe:Swiss Chard and Mushroom GaletteExplore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterGalettePieMushroomRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
