It\u2019s still worth it.By Christina ChaeyDecember 14, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhotograph by Isa Zapata. \u00a0Prop Styling Paige HicksFacebookTwitterEmailAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Changing out your standard cake and tart pans for a slightly out-of-the-box pan can work the same magic on your baked goods. Enter this very elegant, very dramatic long rectangular tart pan that I bring out twice a year when I\u2019m in the mood to make a chic dessert for no reason at all.Yes, you heard that right\u2014I use this pan twice a year. The rest of the time, it takes up space in my very full hall closet where I keep all my bakeware because I don\u2019t have enough kitchen storage. But the oohs and ahhs it garners every time it shows up on the table make it worth it.Fat Daddio's Anodized Aluminum Rectangular Tart Pan$15 $13 at AmazonMy pan is a long and skinny rectangle measuring 4x13\", which means anything I bake in it comes out looking like a giant bar that can be sliced into elegant mini-bars for serving. Like many round tart pans, it comes with a removable bottom that makes it a cinch to unmold and transfer to a plate. I\u2019ve used it to make all kinds of sweet and savory tarts, like a Meyer lemon tart with Paule Caillat\u2019s genius brown butter tart crust and a caramelized onion and Gruy\u00e8re tart with a walnut crust.\u00a0But I also love using it as a cake pan to give cakes a look that\u2019s totally different from the usual 9\" round. I\u2019ve used it to make Amy Chaplin\u2019s gluten-free almond cakes (the Roasted Apple-Almond Cake with Cardamom is a favorite) and I\u2019ve tart-ified the famous Burros torte of tender cake thickly studded with big pieces of stone fruit.This vegan chocolate tart is looking very chic.\nChristopher TestaniThis pan is especially good for any tart that has a roughly equal ratio of filling to crust. At just 1\" tall, the walls of the pan aren\u2019t particularly high, making it ideal for desserts with very rich or sweet fillings that you want just a taste of, like gooey pecans or creamy ganache. But I would shy away from anything where you want a high filling-to-crust ratio, like cheesecake or apple pie\u2014the pan simply isn\u2019t high enough.My pro tip: Heighten the drama even more by serving your tart on an equally long and elegant serving platter that makes it look somehow even more stunning. Sure, you\u2019ll use that plate only once or twice a year, but you\u2019ve already got the pan\u2014you might as well lean into the elegance.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingRecipes you want to make.
