(\u201cTo be honest, it was mostly ranch with a touch of lettuce,\u201d he says.) With vibrant herbs and peppery watercress, this salad is a grown-up version of that childhood favorite.Ingredients4 ServingsDressing1small shallot, coarsely chopped3garlic cloves, crushed1small jalape\u00f1o, halved lengthwise, seeds removed, coarsely chopped\u2153cup coarsely chopped dill\u00bccup extra-virgin olive oil3Tbsp. tahini2Tbsp. fresh lime juice1Tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar1Tbsp. chopped bread-and-butter picklesKosher saltSalad and assembly\u00bdhead of romaine lettuce or 1 romaine heart, quartered lengthwise, cut crosswise 1\" thick2baby bok choy, coarsely chopped1cup watercressKosher salt1cup coarsely chopped cilantro, dill, Thai basil, and/or chivesPreparationDressingStep 1Pur\u00e9e shallot, garlic, jalape\u00f1o, dill, oil, tahini, lime juice, vinegar, pickles, and \u00bc cup water in a blender until smooth; season dressing with salt.Salad and assemblyStep 2Combine romaine, bok choy, and watercress in a large bowl.

I'm always looking for new flavor combinations for salads and this was a great one. I turned it into a whole meal by adding shelled edamame and avocado to the salad and then a piece of fish on top. I couldn't get watercress at the store, but I'm sure that would have made it even better. CJSan Diego11/24/2021This is a delicious, very easy salad. Because jalape\u00f1os' heat varies so wildly, I'd just say to taste as you go. For me, a whole one was too much.BarryKansas City8/27/2021So, I just made this.  I made it exactly as written.  Having tasted the Bok Choy and the Watercress separately as I was preparing the salad, I was ready for this to taste strange.  However, when it all came together I couldn't stop eating it. The more I ate, the more I liked it!  My husband really enjoyed it as well. Avocado may have been a nice addition but really it's just a nice herbal mix of greens which don't need to be messed with. I feel healthy after eating 2 portions of this! DeniseCalifornia4/28/2021Such a versatile salad!
