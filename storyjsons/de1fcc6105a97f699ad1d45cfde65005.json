I pictured myself growing my hair out and wearing those rubber-toe-sock shoes. Yes, even on the subway.Then my foot started to hurt.When I visited a local shoe store, a wise old runner working there questioned whether it was smart for me to go from standing in clogs eight hours a day in the kitchen to wearing floppy minimalist sneakers to live and run in the rest of my day. She politely but firmly insisted I needed to support my feet more. That meant wearing very stiff running shoes, like HOKA and New Balance, and using insoles that actually do something, like Superfeet.Virtually every pair of athletic shoes comes with wafer-thin, virtually non-existent insoles that have very little heel or arch support. This is where Superfeet Black Premium Insoles come in. With ergonomic support for heels and arches, they feel molded to my feet in ways that continue to astound me. They provide near-bespoke levels of support and comfort, plus they come in a myriad of shapes and sizes that work with any foot shape. I find it is imperative to switch my footwear at least once throughout the day to avoid fatigue, bouncing around the office in Superfeet-clad sneakers, then slipping into clogs whenever I am in the kitchen.The funny thing is I had forgotten that I had a pair of Superfeet Green Insoles about 20 years ago. I used them for my hiking boots when I spent a semester studying with the National Outdoor Leadership School (which I highly recommend as well, while we are at it). With the deepest heel cup and extra support, these insoles kept me on my feet, with a 60-pound pack, for three months. It was a hard time in my life, physically punishing and emotionally tough, with feelings of crushing self-doubt. It required endurance on every level. But my feet felt just fine.Now, I\u2019ll never forget about Superfeet again. I have even gotten some of BA\u2019s video crew to start wearing them. Just like me 20 years ago, whatever might be aching them at the end of the day, it won\u2019t be their feet.Buy it: Superfeet Black Premium Insoles and Superfeet Green Insoles, $50 a pair on AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
