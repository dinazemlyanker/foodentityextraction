Love What's Real.FacebookPinterestTwitterEmailMakes about 24Manicotti and fresh ricotta cheese with whole milk will always have a spot in my heart. Growing up and to this day, my dad makes this dish every year for Christmas Eve.  Each bite is perfectly tender and satisfying, and there never seem to be any leftovers.  From the making of the crepe to the milky magic that goes into the homemade cheese filling, it's a hands-on activity and has become a tradition that I'm excited to pass on to and enjoy with my kids.PrintIngredientsCrepe Batter6 large eggs1\u00bc cups all-purpose flour\u00bd tsp. kosher saltNonstick vegetable oil sprayRicotta (yields 1 quart cheese)7 cups whole milk1 cup heavy cream3 tsp. salt5 Tbsp. distilled white vinegarFilling and Assembly2 large egg yolks, beaten to blend1\u00bd  lb. ricotta8 oz. mozzarella, grated1 oz. Parmesan, grated, plus more for serving2 10-oz. frozen chopped spinach, thawed, drained (optional)Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper3 cups marinara sauce, preferably homemade, dividedRecipe PreparationCrepe BatterUsing an electric mixer on high speed, beat eggs in a large bowl until light, airy, pale in color, and can nearly hold peaks, 6\u20138 minutes.Reduce mixer speed to low. Gradually add flour and salt, beating well between additions, until no clumps of flour remain. With mixer speed on low, slowly pour in 1\u00bd cups water and continue to beat until well incorporated. Cover and let dough rest at least 2 hours (this gives the flour time to hydrate and results in a smoother finished texture).Heat a small nonstick skillet over medium and spray with nonstick spray. Pour 2 Tbsp. batter into skillet and cook, swirling skillet constantly to encourage crepe to form a nice, round shape, until set, 15\u201320 seconds. Tap out crepe onto a clean towel; gently flatten any creases. Repeat with remaining batter; if possible, do not stack crepes.Do Ahead: Dough can be made 1 day ahead; keep covered and chill.RicottaHeat the milk and the cream on a heavy bottomed pot/pan until the cream reaches 200\u00b0F.  Stirring as the milk heats up and make sure it doesn't come to a boil.  Once milk registers 200\u00b0F remove from heat and stir in the salt and vinegar.  Stir gently for a few seconds and try to create a gently whirling effect to mix the salt and vinegar.  This will cause the milk to break into curds.  Let the swirling mixture sit at room temp for 10-15 minutes.Strain the mixture using cheesecloth and a metal strainer.  All of the trapped curds in the cloth is the ricotta cheese. Let the cheese hang in the cloth until the desired moisture level is reached. More time draining the drier the cheese.  The leftover is milk whey which can be used for other projects and dishes. Store in fridge and use ASAP.Filling and AssemblyPreheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Mix egg yolks, ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan in a large bowl; season with salt and pepper. Squeeze out excess liquid from spinach, if using, and add to egg mixture; toss to coat.Spread 1 cup sauce in a 13x9\" baking pan. Working one at a time, spoon 2 Tbsp. filling in center of crepe. Spread filling all the way to the ends. Roll up crepe, then flatten slightly with your hands. Transfer seam side down to prepared dish. Working in batches if needed, repeat with remaining crepes and filling, leaving a small gap in between each. Top with sauce and cover with foil. Bake manicotti until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbling, 35\u201345 minutes. Let manicotti cool slightly in pan to set, about 15 minutes. Top with Parmesan and pepper before serving. Repeat full process in a second 13x9\" baking pan with extra crepes and ricotta filling, if desired. Can be stored in fridge or freezer for later or cooked for additional servings.Do Ahead: Filling can be made 1 day ahead; cover and chill. Manicotti can be made 1 month ahead; transfer to airtight containers or freezer bags and freeze.Recipe by Brad LeoneSponsored by Milk.
