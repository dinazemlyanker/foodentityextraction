For breakfast, get the Big Bombay: a plate with a little bit of everything, including buttered buns, baked beans, grilled tomato, bacon, and sausage. You must order the house chai.THE VIBE IS: bustling, efficient, and super fun. Okay, yeah, the hosts do have headsets and the waiters take your order on iPads, but Dishoom doesn't feel like a sterile chain restaurant. Instead, it's just a useful way of streamlining the incredibly high volume of guests coming in for their chili cheese toast fix.PRACTICAL STUFF: Expect waits\u2014even with six locations in London (check the website for hours). Reservations are only taken for groups of six, so plan on camping out at the bar with a Cyrus Irani cocktail (a mix of lime juice, tequila, and turmeric-honey lassi syrup).\u2014Carey PolisWE ALSO LOVEOttolenghiMake a pilgrimage to the Ottolenghi mothership!The Marksman Pub The East London pub with a killer makeoverMomosan ShopAdopt the Japanese hipster home lookExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
