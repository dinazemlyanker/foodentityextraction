I\u2019m surprised she has time to chat with me at all: It\u2019s just 72 hours after the opening of her San Diego restaurant El Jard\u00edn, and a new restaurant tends to suck up a chef\u2019s time and attention with black-hole-grade intensity.Luckily, as a chef and a mother, the former Top Chef contestant and San Diego native has plenty of practice at multi-tasking. She answered my questions about matriarchal cooking and Mexican regional cuisine with honesty, humor and warmth\u2014and without missing a beat in the kitchen, I\u2019m sure.The last time you were giving interviews, it was about your time on Top Chef. [Zepeda Wilkins competed on Top Chef Mexico\u2019s first season in 2016 before becoming a contestant on the U.S. edition\u2019s 15th season, filmed in Colorado.] What have you been up to between now and then?I'm super grateful for the experience. You become part of a family, for better or worse. You love to hate all your brothers and sisters; now I love them, and it's cool.When we were filming Top Chef Mexico, we had the crazy honor of meeting these women who are regional culinary ambassadors. They've been traveling all over the world, women that don't have gas and running water inside their homes, traveling to France and Russia to promote Mexican food. Meeting these woman solidified that we need to preserve something, whatever it is. If your roots are in food, preserve your roots.So I spent the last two years traveling to little remote towns and meeting amazing women. Some of them I'm fortunate enough to have a part of in the restaurant. I have the woven textiles from the women in Oaxaca and Chiapas in the lounge of El Jard\u00edn.The scene at El Jardin\nPhoto by Antonio D\u00edaz de Sandi.You\u2019ve called El Jard\u00edn \u2018a matriarchal restaurant.\u2019 Can you talk about what that means to you?I've gotten some comments\u2014usually from guys\u2014who aren't comfortable with me putting that word out there, matriarchal. I got one comment that said \"Oh, congratulations, you're putting women back into the kitchen, what a novel idea.\u201d It's like, you're missing the point. The point is that we highlight the mothers and the grandmothers. A thing I learned from the women [I\u2019ve met] is that if they have sons and not daughters, recipes that have gone generations and generations and generations will never be made again.Is there anything on the menu that you\u2019re particularly excited about?My aunt had a restaurant in Guadalajara my entire life growing up. She raised six kids, a single mom, on the back of pozole. So that's one of my favorite dishes, not because it's pozole but because of my connection to it. I grew up at her restaurant cutting vegetables for it. It's near and dear to my family. I have my own spin on it, but the meaning of the dish is very special to me.A lot of the stuff you\u2019re cooking with isn\u2019t available in American supermarkets. How do you source your ingredients?My Oaxacan ingredients\u2014things like the papilla mixe, which I use in the sauce for my tamal con mole poblano\u2014are from a woman I met in Oaxaca at a market. She is tough as nails, crazy mean, but it's part of her magic, you know? She runs her stall like\u2014imagine the busiest, craziest diner, and you have that salty waitress who has no time for nonsense\u2014that's who she is. She's like an auctioneer in her soul.I also get pixtli, the pit of the mamey fruit, to flavor the ice cream in the No Mamey\u2019s dessert, and rosita for the brunch chocoatole from her, plus tons of other stuff: chicatanas, chile coste\u00f1o, pi\u00f1on rosita.I really love pulque [a traditional Mexican alcohol made from fermented agave], so I asked one of my friends to introduce me to some of the men that siphon honey water from the agaves to make it. He took us to this super remote pueblo out by the volcano, and the person that ended up making the biggest impact on my life was his mom. I bought 40 pounds of her mole paste, which she made for me, for the restaurant.El Jardin's No Mamey\u2019s with pixtli ice cream, almond brown butter cake and heirloom corn pinole crumb\nPhoto by Antonio D\u00edaz de SandiWhat about San Diego was exciting to you as a place to open a restaurant?I grew up in Imperial Beach, which is near San Diego. I had my kids very young; I had my son when I was 18 and my daughter by the time I was 21. I understood that I couldn't move them around. I knew that my kids needed some sort of stability. When I worked for Gavin [Kaysen] here in San Diego, he went to New York to go work at Cafe Boulud and I was like, \u201cI really want to go work with you over there.\u201dI remember I stayed in Chelsea. I didn't have any money, so I stayed at a hostel right above a Subway restaurant. My room smelled like the Italian subway bread. To this day that smell takes me back.The head of hiring, she kind of dug it out of me that I had kids. She said, \u201cDo you have anyone here?\u201d And I said no, and she said, \u201cYou probably don't want to do this. It's going to be a lot of long hours, and you're never going to see your family.\u201d I would\u2019ve had to uproot everything. So [San Diego] became home base for the next 18 years.I love that El Jardin reflects not just the idea of matriarchal cooking, but also the realities of your life as a mother. Are your kids interested in the restaurant industry?My daughter's been here since [we opened]. She hasn't left. She's twelve years old, and she knows where all my tables are.We had a conversation with my general manager, as young moms do, talking about the struggle: When you open a restaurant, you're giving it your all. My daughter was overhearing this, and she's like, \u201cYou know, I didn't get it until the other day. But I get it now; I see how much we need to give to this place to make it work.\u201d I kind of choked up a little bit.You\u2019ve talked about how you power lift in your spare time. How did you pick up that hobby?I've always been kind of freakishly strong. I'm only 5'3, but I can lift a lot of things. I'm bottom heavy, like a lot of Hispanic women, so my legs are crazy strong.When I started doing CrossFit, I needed an outlet. We now have a little bit better understanding of the mental health issues that come with the territory of [being a chef]. I got into Olympic lifting, and then it was power lifting, because it was cool to be able to lift a keg over my head. Power lifting for me was my way to show off that side of me, that women can be little and mighty.One of my favorite people on earth is the lead singer of Black Flag [Henry Rollins]. He basically says, \u201cA pound is a pound is a pound.\u201d Iron will never lie to you; if it says one pound, it's one pound. It's the only thing that calls you on your shit. You think you're tough shit? That iron will tell you, \"Nuh uh, I don't think so.\" There's something really poetic and humbling about lifting weights.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishChefsMexicanCaliforniaRead Moreculture\"You\u2019re in a World Where the Rules Are Made by Men\"By The Healthyish TeamRecipes you want to make.
