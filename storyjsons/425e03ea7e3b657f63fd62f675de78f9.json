Will. Be. Fried. Chicken. Alison Roman gives you permission to phone in your next party.By Alison RomanOctober 25, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Alison Roman, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiFacebookTwitterEmailWelcome to Party Tricks, a monthly column in which bestselling cookbook author and entertaining pro Alison Roman schools us on the fine art of having people over without pulling out your hair.A nice thing about being a cookbook author is that when you invite people over for dinner, they never ask what you\u2019re making because they assume it\u2019s going to be delicious, possibly even elaborate. The other thing about being a cookbook author? You don\u2019t always feel like making dinner\u2014which, I have finally learned, is very much okay.As soon as I gave myself permission to not \u201cbe perfect\u201d or \u201cmake everything myself,\u201d I started having more fun at my own dinner parties\u2014which yes, occasionally means \u201cordering buckets of fried chicken\u201d and \u201ceating dinner on the stoop.\u201d The times you want to be social in your own home but Just Can\u2019t with actual cooking are the perfect times to literally phone it in and order or pickup the things you\u2019d never make yourself (for me, that\u2019s a very short but specific list and includes fried chicken). Honestly, if your friends show up expecting a side of slow roasted salmon and get upset when they see a paper bucket holding crispy, golden brown legs and thighs...maybe get new friends?Though, in an effort to remind everyone that you still cook (and actually enjoy it!), throwing together a side or two and a few sauces to go along with said chicken is a great move. Plus, the chicken needs a few friends, no? This little extra effort says, \u201cI love you enough to have you over and enjoy my company, but not enough to stand over a vat of hot oil for hours.\u201dIf you got it, stoop it.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Alison Roman, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiI do not mean baking fresh biscuits (we don\u2019t feel like cooking, remember?). I mean quickly tossing together a crunchy shaved salad or slaw made from hearty vegetables like cabbage, carrots or raw broccoli and dressed assertively with lots of citrus and fresh herbs to serve as a fried chicken palate cleanser. I mean casually whisking together a sauce with something like yogurt (or mayonnaise, IF YOU MUST), a little grated garlic and lots of salt and pepper meant for double dipping. I mean whipping up a homemade hot sauce made from finely chopped jalape\u00f1os and white distilled vinegar to dunk in, or an almost-too-hot chili oil made with chili flakes and Sichuan peppercorns to drizzle over for a spicy-numbing experience. I mean serving everything on paper plates, because you also want to say, \u201cI love you enough to not make you do the dishes\u201d\u2014an even better gift than that chicken.More Party Tricks, right this way...Bad Wine Is Just a Great Cocktail Waiting to HappenIn Alison Roman\u2019s new column, Party Tricks, the \u2018Dining In\u2019 author defends the wine spritzer.View StoryExplore Bon App\u00e9titParty TricksFried ChickenEntertainingRecipes you want to make.
