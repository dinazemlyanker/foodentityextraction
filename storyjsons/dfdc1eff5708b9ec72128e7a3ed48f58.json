Subscribe to our print magazine, where we explore a single subject every month. This time around: knives.There is only one entirely incorrect and extremely dangerous way to hold a knife. If you\u2019re gripping it by the handle, you\u2019re already doing it mostly right.That said, not every knife grip provides the same level of control and safety. The goal with any grip is to help you be precise (that\u2019s obviously more important if you\u2019re dicing an onion than halving a winter squash) while providing protection for your valuable and vulnerable fingertips.Perhaps the most natural way to hold a knife is the handle grip\u2014you wrap all five fingers around the handle\u2014there\u2019s no contact with the blade. But for the most power and dexterity, consider the pinch grip (a.k.a. the blade grip). Rather than curling all your fingers around the handle, wrap only your pinky, index, and middle finger. Put your bent pointer finger on one side of the blade and your thumb on the opposite side, like you\u2019re pinching the blade between them. While this takes some practice and might feel a bit awkward at first, it will help you make thinner, more direct cuts. It\u2019s like the difference between holding a pen or pencil in the middle versus moving your fingers very close to the tip, which will allow you to make more detailed strokes in smaller writing.Choke up on the knife, then tuck your fingertips under when you slice.\nWhat you do with your other hand is just as important. The claw (a.k.a. the guide hand) helps you make even cuts while keeping your fingers out of harm\u2019s way. To do it, hold the ingredient like you\u2019re imitating a cat, with your fingertips curled under and tucked away: Your knuckles will press into the ingredient and your thumb, positioned back and below, toward the cutting board, will help to stabilize it. The knife should be flush against your knuckle and you\u2019ll move your hand backward as you continue to slice.Once you\u2019ve mastered the gripper and the guider, the one thing left to do is to practice your knife skills:For Your Own Safety, Please Learn These 18 Basic Knife SkillsTime to practice.View StoryExplore Bon App\u00e9titKnivesRecipes you want to make.
