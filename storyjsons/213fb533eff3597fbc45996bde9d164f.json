One of the building blocks of Japanese cuisine, the most popular dashi is made from just two ingredients (kombu and katsuobushi a.k.a. bonito flakes) and comes together in fewer than 15 minutes. That makes it the fastest route to a slurp-able, umami-rich broth (with no loooong simmers or bags of chicken bones necessary). Here, it's the base of a super savory soup packed with poached shrimp, nutty soba, and tons o' greens\u2014the perfect antidote to that cold you kinda sorta feel coming on.\u00a0All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Meanwhile, soak 1 sheet kombu in 8 cups water in a large Dutch oven until soft and flexible, 15\u201320 minutes. (You'll probably notice a white layer of film on your kombu\u2014don't rinse that off. It's a source of sweetness.)Step 2While kombu soaks, remove leaves from \u00bd large bunch or 1 small bunch mustard greens, kale, mature spinach, or Swiss chard (discard or save the stems), wash, and coarsely chop. Thinly slice 10 scallions; set aside about one-third for serving. Peel 1 1\" piece ginger. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 3Make the dashi: After kombu has soaked, turn heat to medium. Once you see small bubbles around the edges, use tongs to remove kombu. Avoid bringing the water to a boil\u2014it might make your dashi bitter. (As for the kombu, you can save it in the fridge to make another batch of dashi later in the week.)Step 4Add 1 1-oz. package bonito flakes, bring to a boil, and turn off heat. Gently push bonito flakes to submerge, then let stand 2 minutes without stirring. Carefully pour through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl or large measuring cup, being sure to strain out any lingering fish flakes. (You can also save the bonito for your next round of dashi.) That\u2019s it: You\u2019ve made dashi.Step 5Wipe out Dutch oven and return to medium heat. Add chopped greens, remaining two-thirds of scallions, and \u00bd tsp. salt. Using a Microplane, grate in ginger. Pour in \u00bc cup water and stir to combine. Cover and cook until greens are wilted, 4\u20135 minutes.Step 6Add dashi, \u00bc cup mirin, 5 Tbsp. soy sauce, and 1 Tbsp. toasted sesame oil and bring to a gentle simmer.Step 7Carefully lower 4 large eggs into boiling salted water and set a timer for 6\u00bd minutes. Fill up a small bowl with ice water. Immediately plunge eggs into ice bath when your timer goes off. This halts their cooking, keeping them in that gooey yolk state you're looking for. Let cool, then peel.Step 8Return salted water to a boil and add 8 oz. soba. Cook 4 minutes, then drain and rinse with cold water. Divide noodles among shallow bowls.Step 9Finish up: Pinch tails off shrimp; season with salt. Add to pot and remove from heat. The shrimp will turn bright pink in the residual heat of the broth, a sign that they\u2019re cooked through. Taste and add more salt, if needed.Step 10Divide broth among bowls with noodles. Slice eggs in half as you add to bowls. (If you're planning on having leftovers, store the broth, noodles, and uncut eggs separately.) Drizzle yolks with sesame oil and soy sauce. Sprinkle with reserved scallions and 1 Tbsp. toasted sesame seeds.How would you rate Soba Soup With Shrimp and Greens?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (25)Back to TopTriangleI love this soup! I make the dashi and eggs on the weekend for a very quick weeknight dinner. I usually used frozen ramen noodles and whatever greens I have for the week, baby spinach, chard, licnato kale. Sometimes I will use leftover chicken instead of shrimp.AnonymousSoutheast Michigan2/5/2022It was ok - not worth the complexity, but with some time-savers, perhaps ok. For example, I\u2019d use dashi powder instead of the drawn-out kombu and bonito flake soaking (which also feels like a waste of good materials).  Additionally, don\u2019t bother removing the dashi broth, and cooking the kale, scallions, and ginger separately - just cook them in the dashi straightaway. you\u2019ll easily shave 30 min off this with those two changes.\n\nAdditionally, I didn\u2019t salt the shrimp, and added half the soy sauce - I\u2019ve found some recipes on here too salty, and was glad I listened to my gut.VCBoulder1/31/2022Quick to assemble, and I used frozen chopped kale. Super easy and so worth it!ZPDoylestown PA12/28/2021Too complicated for the result. AnonymousNowhere12/11/2021How much dashi do you end up with? I have some of the broth. GayPhiladelphia 7/25/2021I made it last night and have to say I was skeptical; I don't like very fishy tasting foods but I really liked this soup.  I will probably make it again.  The only thing I would have done differently would be to have chopped up the shrimp so that they were bite-sized before cooking them; it would have been easier to eat (I used shrimp 20-25 per pound size).\nI had leftovers for lunch and it still tastes greate.DenitomiConncecticut3/26/2021I made this soup 2nite.  The house smells wonderful.  Really very easy.  I used kale & it worked.   I learned a new trick for broth & that makes me happy.  Thanks!ConniegPhiladelphia2/4/2021Absolutely delicious.AnonymousToronto, ON1/28/2021This is delicious! It's definitely in my rotation now. I throw in the shrimp shells when I put in the bonito flakes as well. I've also made this and served it over brown rice which works great too. I use furikake at the end instead of plain sesame seeds for a little more ocean-y flavor. SarahBerkeley, CA1/22/2021We loved it. I've never cooked with bonito or nori and really liked it. The noodles make it. Austin, TxUSA1/10/2021Loved this and the ease of making it. Made sure I had all the correct ingredients. I added a little chili garlic at the end to my bowl and it perfected it!! Monique pyleNew Orleans 12/11/2020Delicious! \nI couldn\u2019t find kombu or bonito flakes so I used nori sheets and dried shiitake mushrooms for the dashi. Came together quick and turned out great.
