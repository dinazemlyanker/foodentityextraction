Think about it: By its very nature, they\u2019re the most ordinary, quotidian, unspecial stuff you could possibly keep around. But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. This year, in an attempt to keep things exciting in our kitchens, we added some new tricks to our fridges and cupboards. We\u2019re talking flavor bombs like an umami-rich fish salt and a smoky-hot spice, toasty sesame seeds to amp up dressings and salads, and nutty, toothsome wheat berries to give your usual go-to grains a rest. Sure they\u2019ll be a whole new crop of things to fall for in the new year, but we\u2019re still psyched about these goodies.Red Boat Fish SaltI love Red Boat\u2019s fish salt, which is made from just anchovies and sea salt. It\u2019s saved me more than once when I\u2019ve run out of the tinned stuff. Add a pinch to Caesar dressing or fish stew, mix it to make anchovy-salted butter, or stir it into olive oil and make croutons. \u2014Amanda Shapiro, senior editor, HealthyishBuy it: Red Boat Fish Salt, $15 on AmazonJacobsen Flaky Sea SaltAbout six months ago I finally got around to buying flaky sea salt, namely Jacobsen sea salt, for cooking at home (I already had a stash at the office). Once I finally got it, I never looked back. I showed my roommate the ways of the flaky sea salt too, and now we both use it on everything from eggs to roasted veg to meats. \u2014Emily Schultz, social media managerBuy It: Jacobsen Hand-Harvested Pure Flake Sea Salt, $30 on AmazonEden Foods Toasted Seasoned Sesame SeedsDoes anyone toast their own sesame seeds? I doubt it, and untoasted sesame seeds are mostly a waste of time. Toasting brings out the flavor, and yet most nuts and seeds in supermarkets aren\u2019t optimally toasted, including the ones that claim they are. The one exception is toasted sesame seeds, sometimes labelled gomasio, which I started keeping on hand this year. They are cheap and crazy flavorful and so nicely toasted\u2014they don\u2019t have any of the charred spots I get when I do them in a skillet on the stovetop, totally pissed I\u2019m toasting seeds on Tuesday night. It\u2019s easy to sprinkle them with abandon on salads and vegetables, or blend them into dressings. \u2014Chris Morocco, senior food editorBuy It: Eden Foods Toasted Seasoned Sesame Seeds, $3 at VitaCostBob\u2019s Red Mill Wheat BerriesWheat berries became my grain of choice this year. I love how nutty and chewy they are\u2014cook \u2018em like pasta and they stay especially al dente. I\u2019m convinced they turn what might otherwise be a sad whatever\u2019s-left-in-my-fridge salad into a meal actually worth looking forward to. \u2014Sasha Levine, senior editorBuy It: Bob\u2019s Red Mill Wheat Berries, $9 on AmazonPhoto by Max FalkowitzBlack Urfa ChiliThe spices now available to us home cooks are better than ever. New companies selling single-origin, direct-trade spices are popping up left and right, and I want to try them all. But the one I obsessed over in 2018 was Black Urfa Chili from Burlap & Barrel. I\u2019ve been sprinkling it on every snack I make\u2014from eggs to hummus to cucumbers doused in rice vinegar\u2014and cooking with it too, adding it to braises and sauces. If you know Aleppo-style pepper, Black Urfa will seem similar, but it\u2019s smokier and sweeter, and the burn lingers longer. I\u2019m in love. \u2014Anna Stockwell, senior food editorBuy It: Black Urfa Chili, $9 at Burlap & BarrelMarumoto Neri Black TahiniI use black tahini in place of regular tahini when I want a more intense sesame punch. It\u2019s woodsier, smokier, mustier, and a little more bitter, and great in hummus, baba ghanouj, or sesame noodles. I also use it in baking when I need black sesame paste to fill babka or brioche, or when I want black sesame frangipane for a tart. Marumoto Neri is my splurge Japanese brand with a cleaner, toastier flavor that isn\u2019t as earthy and muddy as my go-to everyday black tahini, Kevala. \u2014Sarah Jampel, contributing editorBuy It: Marumoto Neri Black Tahini, $27 on AmazonKitchen Garden Farm Organic Habanero SrirachaI spend so much impulse ca$h at R&D Foods, a gourmet wonderland in Brooklyn. The last thing I bought was Kitchen Garden Farm\u2019s sriracha, which is mostly chiles and vinegar so instead of being gloppy like ketchup from corn syrup, it\u2019s close to liquid. And VERY spicy. The chile flavor is bright and nearly fruity. I can\u2019t eat eggs without it. \u2014Alex Beggs, senior staff writerBuy It: Kitchen Garden Farm Organic Habanero Sriracha, $8 from Kitchen Garden FarmHaechandle Jaeraesik Doenjang Soybean PasteI was adopted from Korea, but didn\u2019t start really cooking the cuisine until this year. Doenjang was one of my first purchases to make a hearty and flavorful soybean stew (doenjang jjigae). Made from fermented soybeans, it\u2019s umami-rich and salty with sweet undertones. It\u2019s great mixed into broth for a quick soup, added to sauteed or roasted vegetables, or stirred into batter for a green onion pajeon (pancake). It also works in marinades and braises, like bossam pork wraps (for that I follow Maangchi\u2019s lead). I am not picky about brands when I buy it in Asian grocery stores, but you can get a 1 lb. tub on Amazon that will last a year in the fridge. \u2014Alyse Whitney, associate editorBuy It: CJ Haechandle Jaeraesik Doenjang Soybean Paste, $11 on AmazonPhoto by ChristabelTexas Gold Black GarlicI was gifted this black garlic by my friend Mitch last time I was in San Antonio, and it is truly the best. It\u2019s the best-quality garlic, grown in Texas and fermented until it gets all sweet and soft and funk-ified. I put this garlic on eggs. I spread it on toast. I put it on pizza. I mix it into pasta sauces. I add it to soups and stir-fries. I munch the cloves whole, I kid you not. It was like eating umami. This garlic did no wrong by me in 2018. \u2014Priya Krishna, contributing writerBuy It:Texas Gold Black Garlic, $9 at texasblackgoldgarlic.comSpicewalla Middle Eastern Spice CollectionI got this Middle Eastern spice trio from Spicewalla as a gift, and oh \u2019twas a good one. There\u2019s spicy-smoky harissa, tart-tannic za\u2019atar, and an Ethiopian-inspired berbere that defies description. I like to rub them onto barbecued meats, sprinkle them onto scrambled eggs or out-of-season avocado toast, and mix them into olive oil for drizzling flatbread. I\u2019m also really into the fact that these spices are small-batch and ethically sourced by one of my favorite chefs, Meherwan Irani. \u2014Hilary Cadigan, associate editorBuy It: Spicewalla Middle Eastern Spice Collection, $13 on SpicewallaMother in Law\u2019s KimchiI feel like I\u2019m the last person at BA who made sure that they always have a jar of kimchi in their fridge. What was I thinking?! As everyone else already knew, it\u2019s now my go-to for adding instant punch to a meal, from crispy chicken cutlets to basic white rice. \u2014Adam Rapoport, editor in chiefBuy It: Mother in Law\u2019s Kimchi, $10 at LuckyVitaminBob\u2019s Red Mill PolentaI have never thought of polenta as a weeknight recipe until our oven polenta with crispy mushrooms recipe! You don\u2019t have to stir it until it\u2019s done, so it\u2019s one of the easiest recipes in my arsenal. I now keep polenta on hand at all times, and this recipe has become my go-to when I have no idea what to make for dinner. \u2014Kate Fenoglio, associate production managerBuy It: Bob\u2019s Red Mill Polenta, $3 at Thrive MarketAleppo PepperSocial media guru Rachel Karten gifted me some aleppo pepper last holiday and it didn\u2019t last long\u2014it went on Caprese salad, Brussels sprouts, saut\u00e9ed green beans, eggs, literally everything. I love how toasty it tastes. \u2014Erika Owen, associate audience development directorBuy It: Zamouri Spices Aleppo Pepper, $8 on AmazonBadshah Chaat MasalaI spirited a box of chaat masala out of the office after Priya Krishna sang its praises in an article. It\u2019s a heady mix of dried mango powder, black salt, cumin, chili powder, and coriander, and it adds a blast of umami funk to anything you sprinkle it on. Priya suggests adding it to almond butter toast, but I\u2019ve taken to liberally dusting roasted eggplant with it (\u00e0 la Gunpowder), which gets all wonderfully crispy and savory. Priya describes it as the only acceptable type of store-bought Indian spice blend you should have in your kitchen, and man do I feel lucky to have it in mine. \u2014Aliza Abarbanel, editorial assistant, HealthyishBuy It: Badshah Chaat Masala, $5 on AmazonAedan Country MisoThe only thing I like about jet lag is that I\u2019m up when no one else is. Which means while most San Francisco residents are still hitting snooze at 8 a.m. on a Saturday, I\u2019m already running around the Ferry Building farmers\u2019 market and snatching up all the good stuff. My favorite find this year has been the Aedan Country Miso, so intensely nutty and earthy that it puts the mass-produced stuff to shame. (It\u2019s made with two types of koji, rice, and barley, which is why you see oats riddled throughout!) Mashed into chicken meatballs or even eaten raw with crudit\u00e9s, this miso is as versatile as The Rock\u2014it just goes with everything! \u2014Elyse Inamine, digital restaurant editorBuy It: Aedan Country Miso, $12 at Good Eggs, or check for local retailers and farmers\u2019 markets near you here.Photo by Max FalkowitzBurlap & Barrel\u2019s Cured SumacFor Burlap & Barrel\u2019s tart and vivacious sumac, the berries are cured in salt and ground up. It\u2019s giving my go-to dish of roasted chickpeas and herbs an invigorating citrus-like finish (and a deep red-violet hue that you couldn\u2019t dream up). \u2014Tommy Werner, assistant video producerBuy It: Burlap & Barrel\u2019s Cured Sumac, $10 on Burlap & Barrel\u00a0All products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
