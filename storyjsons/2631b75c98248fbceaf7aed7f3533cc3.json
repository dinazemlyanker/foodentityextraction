You bought all the ingredients to make Salted Caramel Apple Cookies as a sweet treat for your future (Very Busy) self. You carefully beat the butter and sugar. You lovingly grated the apples. But when you pulled the tray out of the oven, one half of the batch was perfectly golden and the other was dry and a smidge burnt. Your heart sank like a souffl\u00e9 gone wrong. And this is where you learned a valuable lesson the hard way: When baking cakes, pastries, and cookies, it\u2019s usually a good idea to rotate your pans.If you cook from recipes often, you\u2019ve likely stumbled across the instruction to turn your pans 180 degrees about halfway through the bake time. And you\u2019ve also likely wondered, \u201cBut do I have to?\u201d Rotating your pans can feel more like a nitpicky suggestion than a hard and fast rule. After all, shouldn\u2019t our modern ovens be able to hold their temperatures? (It\u2019s kinda their one job\u2026) And haven\u2019t grandmas the world over warned us that opening the oven would let all the heat out and collapse our precious cakes? Not to mention, where is the darn oven mitt, anyway?It\u2019s only when you\u2019ve suffered the loss of a half-burned tray of cookies that you can finally accept the truth: Your oven isn\u2019t perfect, and neither, my friend, are you. Here\u2019s what you need to know about rotating your pans while baking.How do I rotate my pans?This part is easy. If you\u2019ve got one pan in the oven, all you need to do is rotate it 180 degrees. If you\u2019ve got two pans in the oven, you\u2019ll want to rotate the pans 180 degrees and swap both of their locations\u2014whether this means they\u2019re side to side, or on two separate racks. Keep this little switcheroo fast, because the longer you\u2019ve got the oven door open, the more heat you\u2019re letting escape and the longer it\u2019ll take for your oven to come back up to temperature. Our suggestion: Keep your kitchen timer and your oven mitts in one handy spot on your counter so you\u2019re not last-minute scrambling around to silence the beeper and hunt for a makeshift potholder.Why do I need to rotate them, anyway?Even in the best of all possible worlds, one where your oven is perfectly calibrated, it\u2019s very likely that it has a few spots that are hotter than others. In an electric or gas oven, the heat source is usually at the bottom, meaning your lowest rack will get warmer faster. (The inverse if your oven\u2019s heat source is at the top.) Plus, irregularities in the heat source may make one corner hotter than the other. To avoid one section of your bake drying out or browning too much, you\u2019ll want to rotate your pan to make sure each side gets the same amount of love.Convection ovens can help a little with this problem because they use fans to circulate the hot air more evenly around your baked goods. But even that won\u2019t save your buns if a large sheet pan is blocking the airflow.Does what I\u2019m baking make a difference?If you\u2019ve got an oven with minimal hot spots and good airflow, you\u2019re less likely to end up with an uneven bake. The exception, according to Dorie Greenspan, are cookies and any other treats you\u2019d bake on a large, flat sheet pan. \u201cBaking sheets are big and so air doesn\u2019t circulate around them the way it does with, let\u2019s say, a cake pan, and because of that, I\u2019ll turn them,\u201d she writes in Baking with Dorie.Baking with Dorie: Sweet, Salty & Simple$35 $30 at AmazonA good rule of the thumb: The more space a pan takes up in your oven, the less airflow it allows and the more likely you'll need to rotate it midway through cooking. If you\u2019ve got a small oven, one standard-sized sheet pan can be enough to block all airflow around the oven racks.So, should I be rotating my pans when roasting anything?Rotating your pans isn\u2019t just a technique for baked goods and desserts\u2014anything that you\u2019d want to brown evenly could benefit from a quick switch. A recipe for a whole head of cauliflower, for example, where you\u2019d want it to be golden-brown all around, may call for you to rotate your pans.As for simple roasted veggies, it\u2019s your call. Rotating a sheet pan full of broccoli florets is less important, says associate food editor Kendra Vaculin, \u201cbecause I consider variation of crispiness and brownness on my veggies to be a great thing\u2014rather than something to be avoided in a cookie.\u201d Meanwhile, senior food editor Christina Chaey prefers to rotate her veggies for an even roast. Pick your path!Similarly, if you\u2019re someone who likes a mix of gooey puddles of cheese and browned corners, you may not need to rotate those lasagnas or casseroles either. \u201cAnything similarly large and dense is a bit more forgiving and I wouldn't usually bother rotating,\u201d says Chaey. In the end, the question\u2014to rotate or not to rotate\u2014all comes down to knowing your oven\u2019s hotspots, and what you prefer.Are there any cases when I should not rotate my pans?When cooking any recipe that relies heavily on trapped heat or steam\u2014finicky bakes like high-rise cakes; custards and cheesecakes that rely on a water bath; and more delicate, short bake-time treats like macaroons\u2014some say that opening the oven and letting all of the steam and warmth out could cause your baked good to collapse or deflate (though that is up for debate, too). Bottom line: Consult your recipe and trust your gut.Explore Bon App\u00e9titcookingtechniqueRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
