Light, fresh, SO much flavor coming at you from all directions. MAKE THIS.AnonymousVirginia7/26/2021I love this salad! Few and simple ingredients, put together in a way that isn't fussy and makes a lot of sense. I cut all my pieces at the beginning of the week and assemble at lunch time. I feel like a super hero after eating this. So fresh and nutritious and filling!josiesappWY5/11/2020What a fantastic salad.  I used cilantro as I forgot the mint.    The heat from the chilli with the sweetness of the melon.....I really can\u2019t say enough about this except my husband doesn\u2019t like honeydew melon and while I was eating a smaller version of this salad all I could think was good more for me as I bit into a creamy avocado.   Who over developed this recipe is a Flippn genius.    .    AnonymousToronto Ontario Canada 9/3/2019This salad is delicious.  So light and refreshing.  It's a keeper and a recipe I'll go back to again and again.AnonymousSeattle8/7/2019This was delicious! We doubled the recipe, but on behalf of my kids, I regret doubling the serrano. It was just a bit too spicy for them. Everyone else loved it, and it was both simple and beautiful. AnonymousSF Bay Area7/7/2019Absolutely YES. I made this tasty salad for a summer bbq and everyone was asking for the recipe. I doubled the recipe and it served 12-15 as small side salads. Fresh, green and packs a punch. Definitely a new summer go-to!AnonymousSan Francisco 6/23/2019Great salad, will definitely make again. I substituted chopped flat parsley for mint. Could also use cilantro. Make sure melon is sweet and juicy.
