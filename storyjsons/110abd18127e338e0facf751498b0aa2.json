Don\u2019t drop them!By Priya KrishnaSeptember 5, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Diane KangFacebookTwitterEmailYou may have noticed that many high-end restaurants are upping the ante on their dishware. Gone are the generic, stackable white plates; and in their place are $1,000 Japanese lacquered bowls and one-of-a-kind ceramic pots from Mexico.But\u2026[Carrie Bradshaw voice] one can\u2019t help but wonder: What happens when they drop one?! The reason that restaurants used those homogeneous dishes for so long is that they make for the easiest, speediest service and cleanup. So how do you run a restaurant when you\u2019re working with serving spoons that cost more than your most expensive bottle of wine?It starts with making sure the staff knows what they are handling. At the picturesque tasting menu restaurant, SingleThread, in Healdsburg, California, every guest interacts with over 30 unique pieces of dishware, made by artisans around the world using materials like lacquer, wood, and clay. Employees memorize details about each glass, dish, vase, and utensil\u2014some of which cost into the thousands of dollars. \u201cThey can tell you who made it and where it\u2019s from, and they know that everything is irreplaceable,\u201d chef Kyle Connaughton says.Please don\u2019t break the ceramics at SingleThread.\nPhoto by Eric WolfingerEllia Park, the co-owner and manager of the Korean fine-dining spot, Atomix, sources the dishes for the restaurant largely from Korean artists; these include beauties like a perfectly smooth black ceramic bowl with glossy jagged edges, or a speckled jade bowl into which dollops of fresh cheese and caviar are placed. Park estimates that the total value of all the dishware in the 14-person restaurant is close to $50,000. She allows servers to carry out only one dish at a time, \u201cand with two hands,\u201d she adds. If two plates are required for one course, trays are used, no exceptions. The first time Atomix server Vivian Choi had to handle a dish, \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do with it,\u201d she says. \u201cI was so nervous.\u201dThen there\u2019s the cleaning. The heavy handmade plates Claudette Zepeda-Wilkins, chef of El Jard\u00edn in San Diego, purchased in Oaxaca and Guadalajara for the restaurant are dishwasher-safe and \u201cdestroy-proof,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel really bad for the waiters because they are so heavy when you put the food on them,\u201d she added, \u201cbut they are durable.\u201d She also had the handles removed off of the mugs (\u201cThat\u2019s the first thing that breaks on ceramics\u201d), and her plates are all flat (so they don\u2019t have an edge that\u2019s easy to chip in the dishwasher).At Atomix, Park says that each of the 100 dishes the restaurant goes through on a given night is handwashed (with regular ol\u2019 soap, surprisingly), immediately dried, inspected for food particles or damage, and then wiped again and reinspected before being reused. Some of the serving spoons at the restaurant are made with Korean copper, which can gradually change color when exposed to water. Those get wiped down multiple times, and once a week they are rubbed with a special cream that prevents the color from fading.Use both hands! At Atomix, cards detailing each course also come with information about the ceramist who made the dish.\nPhoto by Evan SungIf you think that\u2019s intense, Connaughton literally built a custom dish-cleaning system around SingleThread\u2019s specific needs. This involves two stations where dishes are individually sorted and washed by four dishwashers, and every washing surface is covered with silicone material \u201cso that nothing ever touches metal or a hard surface,\u201d Connaughton says. The dishes get dried with microfiber towels, and when they are put back on the shelf, there are felt liners placed between each of them.\u201cFor a restaurant that has 50 guests a night, to have four dishwashers working is not the norm,\u201d Connaughton says. \u201cBut that\u2019s what it takes to take care of all of that.\u201dEven with these meticulous systems in place, every chef admitted that breakages are still common. At SingleThread, Connaughton estimates that at least one dish breaks per week.His team uses an ancient Japanese technique called kintsugi for doing repairs, which means filling the damaged area with melted gold. The idea, he says, is to show \u201cthe beauty of the repair.\u201dPark usually ships damaged dishware back to the artists for fixing. Broken serveware poses a bigger challenge to Atomix, as the restaurant has only between 15 and 20 copies of each dish, and seatings are 14 people each. \u201cIf someone broke two plates, we would have to change the plates for the whole course,\u201d she says.At El Jard\u00edn, even those heavy-duty dishes get chipped from time to time. Zepeda-Wilkins uses the maimed plates for family meal. \u201cI make my employees eat off chipped plates so they look at them every day,\u201d she says with a chuckle. \u201cIt is our joke.\u201dShibumi, the L.A. sushi restaurant known for its Japanese ceramics, has rubber floors in its kitchen, so that if a piece drops, it doesn\u2019t break. The rubber was significantly more expensive than tile, chef David Schlosser says, \u201cbut I knew we had to make the investment because of the ceramics. I can\u2019t tell you how many pieces drop on the floor and don\u2019t break.\u201dTo sum up: These fancy dishes are pricey, hard to maintain, and require custom cleaning equipment, sometimes even specialized flooring. Are they really worth it?Park, and the others, are unequivocal. \u201cIt\u2019s risky, definitely,\u201d she says, but the dishware \u201cis a symbol of respect toward the chef\u2019s cuisine and his efforts. It is part of the cuisine itself. It\u2019s worth it.\u201dInside Nonesuch, our No. 1 Best New Restaurant, where art and food intertwine:Explore Bon App\u00e9titEntertaining + StyleRestaurants + TravelRecipes you want to make.
