Grill your corn over the high heat of just-lit coals, then let it hang out in a cooler while you grill proteins and more delicate vegetables. The corn will finish cooking by steaming in the cooler and stay warm for hours. \u201cIt steams, gets nice and fragrant and juicy. Open up that cooler and pow, it\u2019s like a Yankee Candle.\u201dIngredients4\u20136 servings 6Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 3 Tbsp. plus 1\u00bc tsp.
