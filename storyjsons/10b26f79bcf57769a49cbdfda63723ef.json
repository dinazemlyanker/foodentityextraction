I grew up in the 1990s, the low-fat decade, and the only fat source my mom allowed in our kitchen was a drizzle of olive oil when absolutely necessary. We had one vintage butter dish that would surface only when we had corn on the cob. So when I became a vegan ten years ago, I desperately missed yogurt, cream cheese, and just about any baked good, but never really butter. And it\u2019s a good thing, because the plant-based alternatives have always skewed more toward \u201cI Can\u2019t Believe It\u2019s Not Butter\u201d than Bordier. Then I tried Miyoko\u2019s.My gateway was the brand\u2019s vegan cheese (their mozzarella is pretty uncanny), but I didn\u2019t fall in love until I found the cultured butter at Whole Foods. Looking at the label, I liked that it didn\u2019t have any weird colorants, gums or \u201cflavors.\u201d It was just a blend of coconut and sunflower oils, cashews, salt, and cultures. I threw it in my cart.First I added a pat to a perfectly roasted sweet potato. Then I used it to coat steamed broccoli. I slathered it on a slice of Fitness Bread. I saut\u00e9ed mushrooms in it, then I went full-on fancy chef and browned it to top a shaved celeriac salad. The butter was going on/in/with everything, and I couldn\u2019t get enough. EVOO and I went on hiatus.It's highly spreadable.\nPhoto by Alex LauI found that Miyoko\u2019s works brilliantly with sweet foods, too, like on top of stacks of pancakes and inside homemade morning buns. I even use it to make a vegan buttercream, and it gives the frosting a slightly savory, cultured tang. Perhaps my favorite thing about Miyoko\u2019s is that it doesn\u2019t require a trip to a specialty grocer; you can get it at Trader Joe\u2019s, Target, or online.It\u2019s funny that I had to go vegan to discover a butter that I loved. My next move is to get my mom to try it, and I bet it will find its way onto her next slice of toast. Maybe she\u2019ll even give it a home in that vintage butter dish.Buy it: Miyoko's European Style Cultured Vegan Butter, $6.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
