It\u2019s creamy. It\u2019s tangy. It can be spiffed up in endless ways: tahini ranch, Gochujang ranch, miso-tofu ranch, yogurt ranch. And, it goes with everything\u2014from hot wings to chicken Milanesa\u2014as a dip and as a dressing. What\u2019s not to love?Thankfully, Chris Morocco made up a new excuse for us to eat the stuff all winter long with the standing ovation\u2013worthy Radicchio Salad with Sour Cream Ranch, a swoon-worthy trifecta of bitter radicchio, creamy dressing, and crunchy breadcrumbs. It\u2019s easy, it\u2019s satisfying, it\u2019s everything you want when the rest of the produce on the shelf has taken a turn for the worse.Let\u2019s start with the dressing. It is made up of equal parts whole-milk Greek yogurt and sour cream, along with sherry or apple cider vinegar for tartness, one grated raw garlic clove for some spiciness, a small amount of honey to cut through the garlic, and finally some olive oil to round the whole thing out. It is an exemplar in balanced flavors that honestly deserves to be eaten straight-up with a spoon.Everything is coming together.\nPHOTO BY MICHAEL GRAYDON + NIKOLE HERRIOTT, FOOD STYLING BY REBECCA JURKEVICH, PROP STYLING BY KALEN KAMINSKIAs for the lettuce, Chris recommends Castelfranco radicchio for both its taste and looks. \u201cIt tends to be more tender and mild than Chioggia (the round one) or Treviso (the spear-shaped one),\u201d he says. \u201cPlus, everyone has seen red varieties before. The white is more dramatic.\u201d I couldn\u2019t find Castelfranco at my grocery store, so I ended up using all Chiogga. The result was a bit too bitter for me, but Chris recommended subbing in one of the two heads of lettuce for endive, which isn\u2019t quite so biting. And, for what it\u2019s worth, another sturdy lettuce like Romaine or even raw kale would work, too.The final step is making the breadcrumbs, which offer a textural diversion of the best kind: crunchy! Chris calls for Panko, the Japanese breadcrumbs that are in slightly bigger pieces than those fine Italian-style breadcrumbs. You saut\u00e9 them in olive oil along with a couple of thinly sliced scallions. \u201cWhen alliums are caramelized, they have a bit of sweetness in them, too, which helps pull the whole dish together,\u201d Chris says. \u201cIt complements the toasty-ness quite nicely.\u201dSo next time you\u2019re planning dinner, leave the sad Mesclun mix at the grocery store, forget your simple lemon vinaigrette, and make this showstopper instead.Get the recipe:Radicchio Salad with Sour Cream RanchWith salty, sweet, and creamy components, this recipe is more than just a salad: It's a fully realized side dish.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titSaladRadicchioBreadcrumbsSalad DressingWinterRead MorecookingHow to Make a Thanksgiving Salad That Everyone Will Actually EatBy Sarah JampelLifestyleThe Pizza Place We Can't Stop Going To...For the SaladBy Priya KrishnaRecipes you want to make.
