As soon as I feel a slight tingle in my throat, I complain loudly to my husband until he brings me hot tea. Once the feverish chills set in, I wrap myself in every blanket I own and demand massages. I slink over to my couch and plop there for hours, letting the full effects of my illness settle in. At this point, I\u2019m sneezing and coughing as often as I\u2019m blinking, achy everywhere and somehow snotty in my nose but bone-dry in my throat (aren\u2019t they connected somehow?). But here, in my woozy, weak state, I remember the remedy for my suffering is within my reach: this incredibly simple yet satisfying khao soi.I\u2019ve been making this khao soi since before I started working at BA, and it\u2019s become just as regular in my sick day cooking rotation as the stupid-easy garlic broth. That\u2019s because this recipe gives me everything I need when I\u2019m sick. I can prep all the khao soi paste ingredients\u2014chop the shallots and cilantro; peel the ginger; measure the coriander, curry powder, and turmeric\u2014then take a well-timed nap while the dried chiles soak and before everything gets whirred into a paste.As I cook the paste in my Dutch oven, the spice flushes out my congestion and, after I pour in the coconut milk and the chile paste and drop in the chicken thighs, I can take another nap while it cooks. Feeling slightly more refreshed and alive, I\u2019m strong enough to shred the cooked chicken, boil the egg noodles, and chop the red onions, bean sprouts, lime wedges, and whatever else I want for topping my soup. Once the noodles are done, I slide the shredded chicken back into the broth, drizzle in some fish sauce, and sprinkle some palm sugar like I\u2019m some sort of self-sufficient adult.Sitting on my couch, with a big bowl of khao soi brimming with chewy noodles and fall-apart-tender dark meat, the Benjamin Button effect fades. The rich coconutty broth is like lotion to my raw throat. The combination of ginger, chiles, and red onions provides just enough heat to calm down what remains of my sinuses. The complex flavors\u2014fresh limes, vibrant turmeric, cleansing cilantro\u2014prove how chicken noodle soup really does do something for the soul (did you read those books too?). As I slurp and slurp and slurp, I feel like a whole, functioning adult again and, thankfully for my husband, no longer in need of hot tea or on-demand massages.Get the recipe:Chicken Khao SoiA simple curry paste gives this northern Thai\u2013inspired soup surprising depth of flavor.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titNever FailRecipes you want to make.
