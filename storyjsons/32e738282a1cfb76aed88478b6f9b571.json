Being the spice fiend that I am, I asked the woman behind the counter for a side of Sriracha. At first, when she handed me an unfamiliar yellow bottle, I was confused. The bottle\u2019s silhouette was similar to the red Huy Fong Sriracha I know and love, but the nozzle was yellow instead of green. Instead of a rooster on the label there was a mountain range, and the sauce itself was a vibrant yellow-orange. It looked like Sriracha from an alternate universe.Photograph by Isa Zapata. \u00a0Food Styling by Micah Morton. Prop Styling by Paige HicksThree Mountains Yellow Sriracha$9 at AmazonI drizzled a few lines over my poke, then handed the bottle to my boyfriend to try as well. We took our first bites. Oh. My. Goodness. The yellow Sriracha had a tangy sweetness with a lingering heat that left me wanting more. I liked it so much that, before we left, I went to snag a few pictures of the bottle so that I could add it to my pantry ASAP.I couldn\u2019t stop wondering, What the heck is in Three Mountains yellow Sriracha that makes it so good? It contains only five ingredients: yellow chiles, sugar, garlic, vinegar, and salt. Upon further investigation, those \u201cyellow chiles\u201d are Thai burapa chiles, which can range anywhere from 50,000 to 300,000 Scovilles\u2014hotter than a cayenne pepper but a bit milder than a habanero. No hate to red Sriracha, but its distinctive\u2014though delicious!\u2014flavor sometimes overpowers my meals. (Admittedly this could partially be due to user error. I have a heavy hand with hot sauce.) While red Sriracha tends to be \u201clouder\u201d in spiciness with its kick hitting you right up front, yellow Sriracha\u2019s heat lingers on the back end. Red Sriracha wants to be the center of attention while its yellow counterpart helps elevate every other part of the dish.Ever since that trip to Savannah, I\u2019ve been using yellow Sriracha on almost everything. On a typical morning, I either start my day with avocado toast or fry up a classic Filipino silog breakfast made with garlic fried rice and a few pieces of glazed beef tapa or fried Spam\u2014either way, yellow Sriracha makes an appearance. I\u2019ve also been adding it to this crispy Thai chicken salad, air-fried spicy chicken wings, and crispy salmon and bulgur. And, of course, I can\u2019t eat poke without it\u2014with foods like delicate raw fish, I want the more subdued, citrus-forward kind of heat these Thai peppers provide. Three Mountains brightens up my every meal with tanginess, heat, and the perfect dose of bright yellow sunshine.TapsilogSweet-salty peppery beef, crunchy garlic rice, and a runny fried egg make this Filipino breakfast perfect for any meal of the day.\u00a0View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make.
