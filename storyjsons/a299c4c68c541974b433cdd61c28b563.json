They fit perfectly:Self-contained. No mess. This got us thinking: What else can we use a loaf pan for that isn\u2019t cake? Look no further for a list that makes what we think of as a single-use kitchen tool not so single-use after all.Icebox cake:Okay, okay, we\u2019re starting with the item on our list most similar to loaf cake, but we still think it counts. Loaf pans are the ideal shape and size for layering up icebox cake, whether it\u2019s Blueberry-Lemon or Pumpkin Spice. The mold will keep the layers nice and even.The neatest icebox cake is made in a loaf pan.\nEva KolenkoIce cream, and the like:If you\u2019re advanced enough to own an ice cream maker, you probably know that after you churn ice cream, you need to re-freeze it for several hours before you can scoop and eat. A loaf pan is the perfect vessel to do it in. In particular, a metal pan will get colder faster than tempered glass or a random airtight container. In a similar (but less fussy) vain, it should also be your go-to for sorbet, semifreddo, and no-churn ice creams, too.It's much easier to get a nice scoop of ice cream from a loaf pan than a quart container.\u00a0\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, food styling by Kat BoytsovaOther sweets:Try this Salted Chocolate Halva or these Nutty Grain and Oat Bars. A loaf pan is also great for layering up a tiramisu, as lady fingers are the exact size of the width of the pan.A cute halva package.\u00a0\nCrunchy coatings:When you\u2019re making cookies or crackers that are roll-and-slice and require a crunchy coating, a loaf pan will hold that coating in the same way as the mayo mixture for the elote. Fill the pan with sesame seeds for Pimiento Cheese Crackers, poppy seeds for these cheesy guys, or coarse sanding sugar for shortbread cookies.A loaf pan helps you get that sesame seed coat without the mess.\u00a0\nMeatloaf:Even though our recipe for BA\u2019s best meatloaf is formed directly on a sheet pan because you wrap the meat in...bacon, if you were to make a traditional version, or omit the bacon, it would go in a loaf pan.Ice shards:Associate editor Alex Delany swears that a loaf pans work great to freeze a giant ice block and then smash into shards for your next party. Stay with him: \u201cIt\u2019s just an easy and interesting way to make ice for a larger group of cocktails that could be made with cubes,\u201d he says. \u201c It makes anything in a Collins glass look ten times better.\u201d To do it, fill a metal loaf pan up with water (again, metal is important because it gets so cold) and stick it in the freezer. Let it set overnight\u2014it\u2019ll take longer than a normal ice cube. When you\u2019re ready to break it up, run cool water on the underside of the pan so that the ice slides out. Then smack a large metal or wooden spoon against the top or bottom to create the shards. (You can wrap it in a towel if you\u2019re worried about mess, or just embrace the flying ice.)Food scraps:Opening and closing the trash can or compost every two seconds while you\u2019re cooking gets annoying. Less annoying? Using a loaf pan to accumulate food scraps that you can toss later (you can use a bowl or quarter sheet tray, too, but for this, a vessel is a vessel is a vessel). All those pesky carrot peels, broccoli stems, and the like can be put right into the pan and then discarded all at once.Buy It: Chicago Metallic 9-Inch-by-5-Inch Loaf Pan, $10 on amazon.comAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
