This isn\u2019t brown rice you have to cook for 45 agonizing minutes. To cook bulgur, the name for parboiled and dried wheat berries, just rehydrate the grain (fine or medium grind) by covering it in boiling water and letting it sit for about 10 minutes. In this recipe, the grains get dressed up with a few herbs and served with fish and fennel for a simple dinner. Plan ahead and make a double batch of the mustard dressing to use as a sauce to serve with proteins or brighten up sturdy greens.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I subbed the sour cream to yogurt, added a bit of honey and definitely didn't use that much mustard lol turned out great. AnonymousNy2/3/2022I love the crispy salmon and the fennel-radish salad.  I could take or leave the bulgur, but do appreciate how quick it is.  It's a bit bland on its own, but if you get a bite of everything together, it works out.  This makes a lot more dressing than you need - would definitely halve the dressing recipe if you won't use up the excess in other salads.LizChicago, IL12/20/2021I made it exactly as recipe called for (except I used ghee to cook the salmon\u2026ran out of EVOO) and we all loved it. My young adult children and \u2018mother more seasoned adults. Yum! Glad I made extra fennel and radish dressing. Heading out to get more salmon!  Saw comment re: adding honey to dressing; that sounds good. And def taste the bulgur to make sure it\u2019s seasoned to your liking.AnonymousLong Island, NY11/28/2021Surprisingly bland dish! I would cut the mustard (haha) next time because it's basically all I could taste -- maybe I needed something higher quality.. But my husband hates mustard anyway, so I think next time I'd try a sriracha variation with different crispy veg. Not an out and out winner for me, but still a lovely plate of food, and I like the crispy salmon skin, gotta do that again.  AnonymousCalifornia10/4/2021Adding this to the weeknight rotation! I especially loved the crunchy salad on top.AnonymousSavannah, GA9/29/2021 The fennel and radish salad is amazing and definitely makes the dish! Would recommend to season well, I also added some honey to the dressing for an added sweetness.
