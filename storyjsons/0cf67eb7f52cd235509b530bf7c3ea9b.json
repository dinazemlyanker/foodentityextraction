Why not customize them and make them for yourself?Panelists Brooke Devard, Trinity Mouzon, Abena Boamah, Sophia Roe, and Maya Allen.\nPhoto by Wanessa YajureTake Abena's own favorite mask, an ultra-moisturizing, skin-nourishing blend of activated charcoal, rosehip power, rosewater, honey, and jojoba oil. \"I love to use jojoba oil because it's the closest oil to our own skin,\" says Boamah. \"Charcoal is great because it's cleansing but not as harsh as bentonite clay, and rosehip powder is great for replenishing but not too overpowering for sensitive skin.\"But this is no one-size-fits-all situation.

Assess where your skin is at, then customize this mask to meet those needs.
