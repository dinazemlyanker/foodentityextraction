So yes, we\u2019ll admit it: We add miso to nearly...everything. But for good reason! Miso, a fermented mixture of beans and grains that has been a fundamental ingredient in Japan for millennia, is salty, earthy, funky, and/or sweet\u2014depending on the type you choose. But before we get to all that, let\u2019s slow down and review some miso 101.First, how is miso made?The standard base comes from soybeans, but other cooked legumes work too. Those legumes are fermented with koji, which are grains\u2014like rice, barley, or millet\u2014inoculated with the mold Aspergillus oryzae. From there, all it takes is time.There are so many different kinds. How do I know what to buy?There are countless varieties of this Japanese fermented soybean paste, but generally deeper color = bolder flavor. Look for unpasteurized organic miso from small local producers and avoid stabilizers, alcohol, or other additives like MSG. The only ingredients should be soybeans, koji, grains, salt, and water.This miso pesto recipe is a real BA favorite.\nPhoto by Alex LauBut wait, I\u2019m still overwhelmed.The shorthand way to comprehend the wide world of miso is to divide it into two major camps. Light miso (like shiro miso, for example) is pale in color, with a relatively short fermentation time; it\u2019s sweet and mellow and great for dressings, glazes, and baking projects. Dark miso (like aka miso) has a longer fermentation time and higher salt content, making it punchier, richer, and more intense; use in hearty stews and braises.South River Miso has a bunch of different kinds, all fermented for varying lengths of time.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigDo you have a favorite kind?We love South River Miso Co.\u2019s small-batch miso, hand-crafted in Masachussetts the Japanese tradition.
