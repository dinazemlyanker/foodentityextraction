Reading about wine helps some, but it\u2019s hard for me to retain any information if I\u2019m not tasting the wine I\u2019m reading about. (What? I\u2019m an immersive learner!) So I downloaded Delectable, a wine app where you photograph and review every wine bottle you open, and tried to better myself.The process goes like this. Buy bottle of wine. Open bottle of wine. Photograph wine bottle label. Then the super smart app technology pulls up the wine it thinks you\u2019re drinking, and most of the time it\u2019s right! This is always miraculous to me; it's the little things. Once confirmed, you rate and can review the wine with a short caption, plus see dozens of other reviews. Those strangers' reviews helped me pinpoint tasting notes, widen my wine vocabulary, and invent one of my one. (You can also follow people on Delectable and treat it like a wino-Instagram. I like to follow BA\u2019s wine editor Marissa Ross because she drinks cooler stuff than me and I find that aspirational.)The more you play around with Delectable, the more you start to notice patterns in what you\u2019re into, what you hate, and the qualities you seem to like in wines. I\u2019m not a fan of funky, tannic natural wines that suck my tastebuds off my tongue. I like FRUITY, OKAY? I drink too much Gruner. I seem to mention Parmesan cheese a lot for some reason.Then I started to use Delectable as a wine diary, leaving long, stupid, personal captions for myself about where I was when I was drinking it, what was going on that day, weird details from the night. Since I\u2019m not using it as a social network and don\u2019t care about followers, I like this self-indulgent use. In fact, I find the memory of the weekend/dinner party/ restaurant meal helps me place the wine in my memory too.Oh man, this Meinklang frizzante ros\u00e9 was so good, I remember drinking it in our old apartment, where our grumpy landlord forbade our back deck grill and ruined our summer. But lack of a grill didn\u2019t matter when we were drinking this juicy strawberry fizzwine; it was delicious.Because it\u2019s an app, and apps are pretty much over at this point, sometimes I forget to use it. I haven\u2019t posted in four weeks, but then again I\u2019ve been drinking a lot of whiskey lately. I\u2019ll get back to it. The journey of self discovery is never over.You know what also helps?
