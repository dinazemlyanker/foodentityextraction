But also: good bread.By Andy BaraghaniAugust 5, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Susie Theodorou, prop styling by Aneta FlorczykFacebookTwitterEmailI\u2019ve done tomato toast. Last summer, the summer before. It\u2019s my favorite thing to eat from August 1 to Labor Day. This year, I got a lot of questions from readers asking what the new tomato toast was going to be. Well, it\u2019s this untraditional but exceptional pan con tomate. You\u2019re welcome.If you\u2019re familiar with the Catalonian staple, you\u2019ll notice I changed up the technique a bit. The idea of rubbing tomatoes on stale bread didn\u2019t do it for me, so you\u2019ll need an oven for toasting and a box grater for getting maximum flavor from those perfectly ripe tomatoes. These steps don\u2019t make the recipe any harder, but they do you more control over the outcome. Think of this as the Type A person\u2019s pan con tomate. It\u2019s still simple, and still requires minimal effort for an incredible payoff. I might even say it guarantees it. Let me walk you through it.The breadYou need a thick slice of bread to soak up juices from the tomatoes. I used ciabatta loaf, cut in half, open-faced. I drizzle it with oil and bake it at low heat to dry it out completely so it can soak up the juices. If the bread\u2019s too fluffy, it\u2019ll get soggy under the tomatoes, and we\u2019re going for crispy edges here. (In keeping with tradition, though, when the toast\u2019s warm, rub it with a cut half of garlic.) I want to control every factor of a recipe, so I\u2019d rather dry the bread out myself than call for stale bread, which you also might not have casually laying around.The tomatoesUse good ones. At the market, feel for heavy fruit that gives off a sweet, tomato fragrance. There aren\u2019t lots of other things going on here, so it\u2019s worth spending the time finding the winners.The methodWhen you rub the tomatoes on the bread, you don\u2019t get the tomato skin, just pulp. But the tomato skin has a ton of flavor, aroma, and texture, so I grate the tomatoes and then chop up the skin and mix that back in. I season that with a ton of salt and oil, spoon it over the bread, and then leave it for a minute or two. Letting the toast sit will help it really soak up the tomatoes.That\u2019s as perfect as it gets. But if you want to gussy it up further, you can add herbs like oregano, fresh cracked pepper, oil-packed anchovies, chile flakes, and/or lemon zest. And if you\u2019re entertaining, you can make it ahead; the toasted bread can sit, keep the tomato mixture separate, and then spoon it over before serving.Get the recipe:Pan con TomateSpoiler alert: We broke with tradition. Instead of rubbing toast with cut tomatoes, we grated the tomatoes to make a raw sauce that the bread can really absorb.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titTomatoRecipes you want to make.
