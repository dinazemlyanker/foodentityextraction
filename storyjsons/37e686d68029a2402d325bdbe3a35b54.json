Hungarian. Spanish. Smoked. Sweet. Here's how to get down in paprika town.By Alex DelanyJanuary 4, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailTed CavanaughFacebookTwitterEmailPaprika falls somewhere between red and orange, and it ends up on deviled eggs. That\u2019s about the extent of many people's paprika knowledge. Most of us don't understand the different types of paprika. We know paprika, but we don\u2019t really know paprika, kind of like your friend\u2019s freshman year roommate. What\u2019s that dude\u2019s deal, anyway? Who is he, really? We\u2019re launching an investigation. Into paprika. Not the roommate.There\u2019s more to this sweet, smoky, flavorful spice than deviled eggs. There are different varieties, with different origins and flavor profiles, and, while the world of paprika is a wide one, it all starts at the same place.Paprika is made from dried peppers. That\u2019s where the red-orange color comes from, but, as you know, just because two peppers are red, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they taste the same. Paprika varies in flavor based on what types of peppers are dried and pulverized. The spice can range from mild to spicy, a little sweet to 100% savory. Here are the most common types you\u2019ll encounter:Chicken Paprikash is a classic paprika-friendly dish.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigBasic PaprikaThe paprika that you see in the grocery store, the stuff that just says \u201cPaprika\u201d on the front, is guaranteed to be mild. That\u2019s about it. Regular paprika is the least assertive in flavor, offering a low-intensity pepper flavor without much heat or sweetness. The real play here is for color, not flavor. Livening up chicken, hummus, eggs, potatoes, or rice with a dash of the red stuff makes life a little more interesting.Hungarian PaprikaIf you want to know about true, deep paprika love, talk to the Hungarians. It\u2019s the country\u2019s spice of choice, a staple in Hungary\u2019s national dish: Goulash. Where our basic grocery store paprika is one-dimensional, Hungarian paprikas are anything but. It's like comparing The Little Engine That Could to The Iliad. One is\u2026a little more complex. Hungarian paprika traditionally comes in eight different flavor profiles, ranging from mild and bright red to spicy, pungent, and pale orange. The most common is a bright red variety called \u00e9desnemes, which has a pungent pepper flavor and sweetness. You\u2019ll most likely see it labeled as \"Sweet Hungarian Paprika\" outside of Hungary. If you live in Hungary, you should have just skipped this section. Sorry.Spanish PaprikaOften labeled \"piment\u00f3n,\" Spanish paprika is commonly made with smoked peppers, which, as you can probably gather, brings a deeper, smokier flavor to the table. The heat and sweetness levels in Spanish paprika vary based on the blend of peppers used. You might see dulce (sweet), agrodulce (bittersweet), or picante (hot) varieties at a spice shop or well-equipped grocery store. This isn\u2019t to say all Spanish paprika is smoked, but the Spanish varieties available to us most likely are. And when we\u2019re making something like paella, that's exactly what we're looking for.Chicken Paprikash time is now! Go! Go!
