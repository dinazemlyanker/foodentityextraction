It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Grinch de No\u00eblClaire Saffitz was wearing a bright red sweatsuit and a green puffy coat. \u201cI\u2019m really not in the holiday spirit,\u201d she said.She was sleep-deprived, past her cookbook deadline, and exhausted from a day of filming. But even when Claire is feeling Grinchy she is kind and generous with her time. And I wanted to know: Why in the world would anyone ever want to make a b\u00fbche de no\u00ebl?\u201cIn their right mind?\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure why.\u201d The labor intensive, showstopping rolled cake requires a minimum of three components: a sponge cake, a filling, and a frosting. It\u2019s a project with a capital P. Claire developed a maximalist b\u00fbche for Bon App\u00e9tit in 2015. It looks like a birch log plucked from a Christmas card. It has a bittersweet espresso ganache. Mascarpone filling. It has BRANCHES. \u201cI went for it with the decorations with that one,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted it to look like an actual log. A decomposing log.\u201d A classic Claire shrug. \u201cI do like making the meringue mushrooms! But if you\u2019re in a hurry, you shouldn\u2019t be making b\u00fbche de no\u00ebl.\u201dA gorgeous b\u00fbche in the newly updated Tartine cookbook\u2014Claire and I discussed the ingenious white chocolate mushrooms here, which look SO REAL.\nPhoto by Gentl & HyersIf you\u2019re not up for a b\u00fbche, Claire suggests making gingerbread or her stunning sticky toffee bundt cake from October 2015. \u201cNo one cannot like it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have enough stress around the holidays to worry about meringue mushrooms.\u201dWe love you, sticky toffee bundt.\nChristopher TestaniGet the recipes:Double Ginger Sticky Toffee PuddingB\u00fbche de No\u00ebl IF YOU DAREI also like Claire\u2019s Apple Gingerbread Cake with CreamWant this letter before it hits the website?

What can I say, I\u2019m a news junkie. Martha wrote:\u201cDear antoni: this is @marthastewart48 You did not tag me on this photo of my stable nor the photo of my beautiful dogs Han, Qin , bete noir and creme brulee We are bummed about that because you have so many followers and you are my Christmas cookies!!! You were nice not to post the forbidden scenes and we thank you!!!\u201dWHAT ARE THE FORBIDDEN SCENES, MARTHA??? Otherwise, I\u2019ll just assume they got wasted on CBD hot cocoa and decorated anatomically correct gingerbread men.Need a last minute holiday gift?

Jampel. She defines a fudgy brownie as one normally made with melted chocolate, or a mix of melted chocolate and cocoa powder. \u201cThe fat and sugar in melted chocolate give them a creamy, luscious texture with fewer air pockets, less crumbs. They\u2019re dense,\u201d said Jampel. \u201cI want a brownie to melt in my mouth\u2014no chew.\u201dAndy Baraghani is here for chewy: \u201cWhen I take a bite of a fudgy brownie, and then another bite, I don\u2019t want anymore. It sticks to the roof of your mouth,\u201d he said. Meryl Rothstein pointed to Alice Medrich\u2019s fudgy brownies (recipe below), which she makes sans walnuts\u2014another feud for another time. In between slicing what appeared to be 50 pounds of mortadella, Brad Leone groaned, \u201cGahhhhhh not a brownie guy. But if I\u2019m having one, I don\u2019t want the brownie to be rawr inside.\u201d \u201cRawr\u201d is Bradspeak for \u201craw,\u201d which means underbaked, which wasn\u2019t even the question. But okay. Thanks for the mortadella slice, Brad!Claire Saffitz wants chew, \u201cotherwise it\u2019s too rich,\u201d she said. Chris Morocco weighs in: \u201cI want some chew, not a chocolate brick, not some Desserts by David Glass confection. Look it up, Beggs, it was a thing in the \u201890s.\u201d Fine!Sohla El-Waylly is \u201cchewy all the way. I grew up on the Ghiradelli dark chocolate box mix, that\u2019s my reference point.\u201d She tried Jampel\u2019s fudgy brownies, though, and declared them \u201cexcellent\u201d and \u201chigh-caliber.\u201d Stay tuned for that recipe\u2014the result will surprise you!Meanwhile, get the recipe: Alice Medrich\u2019s Cocoa Brownies with Browned Butter and WalnutsExplore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecookingThe Best Eggnog Tastes Like Melted Ice Cream Mixed With BoozeBy Al CullitoncultureThese Bitters Turn a Deadbeat Gift Into a Thoughtful OneBy Hilary CadiganLifestyle10 of My Best Holiday Gift Ideas Because We\u2019re All STRESSED About ItBy Amanda ShapirocultureTrader Joe\u2019s Oat Milk, and More New Winter Stuff, ReviewedBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
