It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Cook mushrooms like steak\u201c\u2018Tis the season!\u201d I declared, pulling a long-forgotten basket from a drawer in my desk. \u201cPEPPERMINT BARK?\u201d screeched Basically editor Amiel Stanek, rushing around the corner to see what it was. Sorry, Amiel. It was the Halloween-candy sized stash of Emergen-C packets I still have from my very official taste-test. Everyone\u2019s been sniffling and sneezing, so it was time to hit the powder.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!It\u2019s also the season for butter-basted mushrooms In the farmers\u2019 market equivalent of a late-night ASOS shopping spree, I spent way too much money on some impulse mushrooms. The most expensive, hen of the woods aka maitake, are also the most delicious, in my humble opinion. The ONLY recipe I go to now is this one, where you treat the mushrooms like steak, basting them with rosemary (or thyme) browned butter until they\u2019re tender, crispy, and divine.Photo by Emma FishmanWhere is everybody?The office was eerily quiet. Last weekend, a handful of BA staffers were in Portland for Feast, and here\u2019s what my eyes and ears on the ground reported back. Editor in chief Adam Rapoport, who was caught drinking prosecco on ice, told deputy editor Julia Kramer that all staff were required to run the Healthyish 5k-ish, \u201cAnd he made me run alongside him, making small talk, the *entire time,\u201d she said. There was a field trip to a dispensary that looked like a Parisian jewelry store, where one editor picked up some CBD bath salts for his wife. At dinner at Kachka, herring under a fur coat and too many vodka shots were had. Brad was recognized by strangers everywhere he went (\u201cI have so many friends here!\u201d he told associate editor Christina Chaey). People transported via electric scooters. Amiel wore a lilac suit. The Turkey and the Wolf team brought their own McDonald\u2019s plateware and a 12-pack of Pabst. I guess you just had to be there!Farewell, restaurantNew York readers might have heard that Caf\u00e9 Loup closed this week for alleged tax evasion, which is a pretty gangster way to go for an old school spot like that, so I accept this news with a grief and understanding. A few semesters ago, I took a continuing education writing workshop at the New School (never stop learning!), and every Friday after class, I\u2019d meet a friend there for an icy martini\u2014and sidecar\u2014with fries. Everything else on the menu was terrible. It would be 6 p.m., the place mostly empty, and the maitre\u2019d would look at me with disgust and say there were no tables. And then he\u2019d relent, fine, a little spot near the bar, if you must. (I guess I didn\u2019t look enough like Christopher Hitchens.) So farewell, Loup! May you rest in peace in restaurant heaven, where I imagine Florent lives on, 24/7 in our hearts.Twizzle de dooWatch Claire make gourmet Twizzlers here!The way the Christmas cookie crumblesDespite the lack of peppermint bark tins, we did have three weeks of Christmas cookie testing at the end of the summer. During those three weeks, we filmed a handful of videos\u2013like Molly Baz\u2019s scallops\u2014and in the background, Chris Morocco has his headphones in, blasting the electronica band Timecop1983. \u201cI really needed to go to a different place,\u201d Chris told me about the struggle to think holly-jolly when it\u2019s 90 degrees out. \u201cI needed ambient soundwaves, no singing, none of Brad\u2019s Neil Young, which honestly is how I feel year-\u2019round, but that\u2019s another thing.\u201d I\u2019ll let the Neil Young comment slide. \u201cI thought he was listening to some dorky dad music,\u201d Molly said, \u201cbut it\u2019s like, the vibiest music ever.\u201d This was Chris\u2019 first year on Christmas cookie duty for the magazine, which is a big deal in our neck of the woods. \u201cHe did a fine job,\u201d said Brad \u201cnot really a cookie guy\u201d Leone. \u201cThe linzer sandwich thing was dynamite. With a cup of coffee, Beggs, forgettaboutit.\u201d I\u2019m a fan of Chris\u2019 sparkly snickerdoodle 2.0\u2014just wait til you see it (December issue!).Tara DonneUnnecessary food feud of the weekAll this cookie talk, and a meeting on the theme of the word \u201ccrunchy,\u201d got people arguing about what\u2019s better: a soft and chewy chocolate chip cookie, or a crispy one? Video editor Misa Spencer is team Soft \u2018n\u2019 Chewy: \u201cI never understood why people liked crispy packaged cookies\u2014they make my mouth dry and sad,\u201d she told me, adding that her mom, apparently a canonized saint, would time her batches of chocolate chip cookies so that they\u2019d come out of the oven right before Misa got home from school. \u201cCrispy cookies belong in icebox cakes and cookie cereal,\u201d said contributor and big ol\u2019 softie Sarah Jampel. Christina Chaey posted an image of Pepperidge Farm\u2019s Sausalito cookies, her favorite of the chewy variety, to which Chris replied: \u201cstop posting things just to upset me.\u201d Others felt a truly perfect cookie is both crispy on the exterior, but soft within. (That answer is a cop-out). But I agree with digital director Carey Polis: \u201cSometimes you have cookie emergencies and that\u2019s when Tate\u2019s is really there for you.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRecipes you want to make.
