So simple and so delicious. You can use the sauce with anything, we make it year round. When there\u2019s too much snow to grill, we just make the fish in the oven or on the stove. Victoria B.Montreal 12/20/2021This was fresh excellent. The sauce is so fresh and we ended up drizzling the extra over everything on our plate - salad, roasted sweet potato, slaw, salmon...I subbed a jalepeno because that's what I had. Also in addition to salt, I topped the Salmon with Aleppo pepper and lemon juice, and cooked on a grill mat over sure thin sliced lemon. Will def be making this all summer.
