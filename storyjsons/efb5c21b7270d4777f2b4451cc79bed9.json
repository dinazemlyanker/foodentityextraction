Make a big batch (you can also try using different chiles, such as jalape\u00f1o, serrano, habanero, Fresno) and add a splash to soups, stews, braises, and creamy dressings.

Really brightens up vinaigrettes, tastes great in stir fry and fried rice dishes, and I cannot wait to try a som tum adjacent application with cucumbers. \n\nThanks again, Allicin. ;)AnonymousDurham11/28/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titCondimentThaiSoutheast AsianAsianThai ChileChileVegetableGingerHerbs & SpicesGarlicRecipes you want to make.
