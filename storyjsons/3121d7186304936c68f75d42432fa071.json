If you sign up for our newsletter, you\u2019ll get her letter before everyone else.My family has our Thanksgiving system down to a T. Or, I should say, down to the manila folder in which we keep a decade\u2019s worth of menus marked up with quantities and guest lists, keeping tabs on the first dish to go (mac and cheese) and the biggest hits (Dad\u2019s chicken-and-waffles appetizer, Mom\u2019s perfect squash soup). Every year I perform a sleight of hand, making sure we end up with an extra tray of cornbread dressing, my favorite, that I can eat for days afterward, sometimes straight from the fridge like a teenager, until it\u2019s gone. My brother mixes cocktails, his girlfriend roasts the turkey, and a family friend always brings the most beautiful carved glass platter decorated artfully with half-moons of winter fruit.Want this letter before it hits the website?

We never make pies because we know someone will bring an extra, and I think that about sums up what the holiday has always meant to me: good food. The love and support of our community. And familiarity too.You know the drill from here: This year will be different. Like so many of you, I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ll be, or whom I\u2019ll be with, or what I\u2019ll be eating. I\u2019ve found comfort in reading through this issue\u2019s very 2020, new-to-everyone Thanksgiving menu plans (hello, tater tot casserole), learning new-to-me techniques from the recipes (hello, tiny pies), and remembering that I\u2019m not alone, that I am not the only one trying my best to figure things out.I don\u2019t know how you plan to celebrate this month, if at all. But I hope you have plenty of good food and good people around you, two things we know can always help us through.Explore Bon App\u00e9titThanksgivingLetters From the EditorsRecipes you want to make.
