I selected the Indian \u201cbouillabaisse,\u201d monkfish and shellfish cooked in a fragrant broth accented with cardamom, coriander seeds, and fenugreek that have been bloomed in mustard oil. For a starter, I served a hearty lentil and celery salad, which I figured could double as a main, should a dinner guest be allergic to shellfish.\u00a0What could go wrong?Plenty.\u00a0One of Greg\u2019s friends, let\u2019s\u00a0call her Madeleine, was allergic not only to shellfish but also to lentils.\u00a0As far as dinner parties go, it was an embarrassing bust. Back then, I didn\u2019t know how to pivot, so it fell to Madeleine to save the day. Unfailingly polite, she pretended she\u2019d eaten a late lunch. I could hear her stomach growling with hunger.Since that day, I always ask if anyone has any\u00a0allergies, and I always have a backup plan, one I had to use this weekend.On Friday, I hosted a dinner party and chose a different recipe starring shellfish: Chris Morocco\u2019s Chile-Lime Clams with Tomato and Grilled Bread. This dish is over-the-top delicious, enhanced by restaurant-level amounts of butter and sambal oelek, a chili paste that lends flavor but not, in this instance, lots of heat. With autumnal hues, this dish is gorgeous, especially with a smattering of red onions (which I used in addition to the shallots the recipe calls for) and multicolored cherry tomatoes.\u00a0The skillet goes right on the direct heat of a grill, though you can use your stovetop instead. Everyone loved it so much, we jockeyed to get the little bit left in the skillet.\u00a0(If you like clams, I strongly recommend it.)I noticed, however, one friend was eating around the clams, choosing instead the garbanzo beans, the jammy, caramelized onions, and the grilled bread.\u00a0I\u2019d asked beforehand; she wasn\u2019t allergic to shellfish. So what was the problem? Cilantro, with which the dish is finished. \u00a0This time, instead of panicking, I turned to my go to: Fridge-Dive Pesto Pasta.\u00a0It\u2019s great for a spontaneous plan B because, as the name implies, you can make it with \u201cany leftover hardy green, lettuce, or herb you don\u2019t know what to do with.\u201d I had fresh arugula and basil and some wilting escarole and parsley on hand, though I suspect it hardly matters because it\u2019s the sesame seeds, which I toasted in the skillet while the greens were boiling, and the ricotta salata that make it memorable. (Ricotta may not be a pantry item, but it lasts awhile, so good to have on hand.) Twenty minutes later, the pasta was done and, this time, no one left hungry.\u00a0So if a surprise allergy or aversion pops up, don\u2019t panic, open another bottle of wine, and get your water boiling.\u00a0Get the Recipes:Chile-Lime Clams with Tomatoes and Grilled BreadSure you can cook clams right on the grill grate, but getting a skillet involved means capturing all of their delicious briny juices.View RecipeFridge-Dive Pesto PastaThis pesto pasta recipe is the solution for any leftover hardy green, lettuce, or herb you don\u2019t know what to do with.
