I'm a vegetarian and, listen, I know what meat mallets are typically used for: pounding meat to an even thickness so that it cooks quickly. Typically, you\u2019ll employ one when you want flat cutlets for dredging and frying, like for saltimbocca, picatta, milanese, katsu, schnitzel, or when you\u2019re hammering tough cuts of meat, like flank or skirt steak, to make them more tender. So, yes, it\u2019s got lots of meaty applications.But as I learned from Carla Lalli Music, who turned to a meat mallet to squash an army of just-fried plantains for her tostones in no time, the meat mallet is no one-trick pony.Just think of what else it can do:Crush garlicCrack or crush nutsCrush olives to remove pitsCrush peppercorns (mmm cacio e pepe)Smash potatoesSmash ice for cocktails (wrap your ice in kitchen towels first!)Break down ginger and lemongrassCrack lobster or crab shellsPulverize crackers, candies, or cookies into crumbsRoughly \u201cchop\u201d chocolateFinally hang that photo on the wall?It\u2019s multipurpose. It\u2019s versatile. It\u2019s not sexy but it\u2019s useful. And it\u2019s not just for meat! Petition to call it a \u201ckitchen mallet,\u201d please! Oh, and if you don't have a meat mallet but you need it right now? Bring out your rolling pin or your heaviest cast-iron skillet. Or grab an actual hammer, then add \"meat mallet\" of need-to-buy purchases, return the hammer to the toolbox, and tell no one.Buy it: KitchenAid Textured Aluminum Meat Tenderizer, $11 on AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
