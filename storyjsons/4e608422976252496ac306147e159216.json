I love them all but so much printing!\nkathrynnew bern nc11/30/2021I made this shortly after I got the issue. Tomato and cinnamon are a heavenly match...I love it so much!  I found that I could make the tomato-based portion of the recipe and add the cooked rice later.  I packaged up the tomato mixture into 8 oz. containers and froze it. It's a wonderful quick meal if you defrost and add to cooked rice. Last night I pulled one out and added about 10 chopped shrimp I sauteed quickly in a bit of butter. Added them to the base and mixed in the Basmati rice. It was fantastic! I plan to always have some on hand in the freezer. MaryAnn NeblockSE Pennsylvania10/2/2021Brilliant. The flavor combination is just awesome.Anonymous8/25/2021I thought this was really easy to make and rather tasty. I added an extra cup of water and the rice cooked just fine. I added a lot of salt. This is good, but not overly flavorful. John SAkron, OH11/9/2020Ahhh amazing! Made this with Andy's Kohresh Bademjan recipe and it went so well togetherAnonymous10/11/2020This was simple and tasty. Ate it with some baked tofu that I had marinated in a combination of Persian flavors (dill, turmeric, lime juice). I think it would go great with falafels and lemony tahini sauce or yogurt.Montreal10/6/2020Incredible!! Andy B with another home run!!  I halved the amount of rice and water and left everything else the same AnonymousWinnipeg9/15/2020This. Was. The. Best. Thing. I\u2019ve. Ever. Cooked. I went back for thirds!!!!!! I texted my fianc\u00e9 at his bachelor party to tell him what he\u2019d missed and that despite the fact that I made the full recipe, there might not be any leftovers. Incredible. I used an enameled cast iron and cooked for 22 minutes. Next time I will only go 20. I have a cherry pie in the oven that I might forego just so that I can eat more rice. e_d_gNew Hampshire9/6/2020I think using ripe tomatoes in season is key for flavour here.   I had some beautiful heirlooms and it turned out well.   Easy recipe.AnonymousVancouver BC9/5/2020This dish wasn't flavorful, I think there was too much rice to the other ingredients. AnonymousPhoenix, AZ, USA8/25/2020Delicious! My family gave me weird looks when I mentioned tomato and cinnamon in rice, but they came back for thirds, will make it again!AnonymousVictoria, Australia 8/21/2020how could you adapt this recipe only using fresh tomatoes?  it's a farmers market challenge so shouldn't it focus on fresh ingredients?  I'm sitting on a bumper crop of tomatoes... :) Anonymous481188/17/2020I know it would throw off the authenticity of the dish but would it work texture-wise if I used coconut oil instead of butter for finishing to make it vegan?AnonymousTurkey8/14/2020This was great rice. Made a batch to pair with some pastrami beef ribs and watermelon basil salad. Kept really well and has made good leftovers too. AnonymousSanta Ana, CA8/14/2020I guess I should\u2019ve known better. I make rice regularly and I should have realized that the percentage of water to rice was way off. The dish would\u2019ve been nice except it never cooked, it turned out mushy when I added more water and now I have to throw out my expensive imported basmati rice. I\u2019ve never had a Bon App\u00e9tit recipe turn out so badly.AnonymousFlorida8/14/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titPersianMiddle EasternRiceRice & GrainsCinnamonHerbs & SpicesTomatoVegetableSummerEasySideNut-FreeGluten-FreeVegetarianHealthyishDinnerRecipes you want to make.
