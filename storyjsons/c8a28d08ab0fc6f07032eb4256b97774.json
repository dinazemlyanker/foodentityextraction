Armstrong RobertsFacebookTwitterEmailEvery week, Healthyish editor Amanda Shapiro talks about what she's seeing, eating, watching, and reading in the wellness world and beyond. Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,Hi there, remember me? I love turning over these newsletters to the Farmers\u2019 Market Challenge every August...but I really love coming back in September and writing them again. It feels right, like shaking out the sand from your totes and your shoes and opening to the first page of a fresh notebook.I didn\u2019t mean to set goals for the fall. It happened as subtly as the days have gotten shorter. But that\u2019s how I always end up making changes: by drifting like a piece of Coney Island beach trash until I hit some shore.And I think September is a better time than January to make resolutions anyway. Everything\u2019s hard in January. It\u2019s cold. You\u2019re probably hungover. September, on the other hand, is full of potential. You\u2019re sunsoaked and calm and clear-headed\u2014or you\u2019re also hungover, but you\u2019re in a better mindset for starting new habits (like writing in that fresh notebook).So in that spirit, here\u2019s what I\u2019m committing\u2014and re-committing\u2014to this fall:Budgeting. Ugh, I know. You\u2019re like, \u201cBut what about grown-up fun?!\u201d And I\u2019m like, I hear you, but you can\u2019t drink the water if the well is dry. So I\u2019m getting an app, either YNAB or Mint. Which one should I subject myself to?Brain organization. I always thought of myself as an organized person, but I recently realized that arranging your pot lids from smallest to largest doesn\u2019t make you organized, just slightly neurotic. My first step toward actual, big-picture organization has been to take the many to-do lists scattered across my digital and physical spaces\u2014from desktop Stickies to the Post-Its on my kitchen counter\u2014and put them all into Trello. I won\u2019t bore you with a rundown of my whole system, but I have Trello boards for both work and life, and so far it\u2019s made me more productive and way less overwhelmed.Exercise...but better. I haven\u2019t had much of a workout routine since I hurt my back last winter while training for a half-marathon. In hindsight I think I was pushing myself toward a goal that wasn\u2019t right for me at the time. Now that I\u2019m finally able to run again, I\u2019m reminding myself to do it for the right reasons (how good it feels!) and not some arbitrary endpoint.Keeping Healthyish fun and awesome. We\u2019ve been working on some really exciting projects for this year and beyond, and I\u2019m very psyched to start rolling them out. First up: Healthyish is heading to Portland, OR for Roux, a festival for and about women in the food and beverage industry. I\u2019ll be there, moderating a panel and hanging with some of our favorite ladies, including Kia Damon, Dana Frank, Caitlin Hata, Sue Chan, and Sana Javeri Kadri.
