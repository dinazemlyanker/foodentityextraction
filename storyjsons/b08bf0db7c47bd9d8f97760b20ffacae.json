They Want a Better Kitchen MatIf you spend as much time in the kitchen as I do, you need an anti-fatigue kitchen mat.By Sarah JampelJune 22, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Emma FishmanFacebookTwitterEmailAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I also live in a no-shoes household (judge as you wish, my relatives certainly do), which means I spend hours cooking without the support of my beloved Danskos, which means I often find myself at the end of the day with a slightly achy lower back and throbbing feet. (Worth it for a little less dirt in the apartment? I say yes.)I knew the solution was an anti-fatigue kitchen mat\u2014a household version of the industrial pads professional chefs rely on to power through multi-hour dinner shifts. I wanted something that would provide the give of a plush rug rather than the unrelenting hardness of a wood floor, but most mats I came across had loud prints with puns in loopy cursive font or seemed too thin to offer sufficient support. That is, until I came across a WellnessMat in my parents\u2019 kitchen (of all places!). The mats are squishy but not too soft\u2014think of a firm mattress with a cushy topper. They come in a variety of colors and textures that are subtle but not drab, pretty but not too flashy, and they\u2019re easy to wipe clean and vacuum.Photo by Emma FishmanWellnessMats Original Anti Fatigue Floor Cushion$150 at AmazonYes, a WellnessMat is a bit pricier than some alternatives, but they\u2019re domestically manufactured and, as I tell myself, I\u2019m probably saving money that I\u2019d normally spend on massages. (Plus, you can find a great deal on a gently used one.) My anti-fatigue kitchen mat enables me to stand for seemingly hours at the counter\u2014washing dishes, loading the dishwasher, kneading dough for...is this recipe serious\u202610 whole minutes?\u2014without exhausting my back and lower body.I think my partner would probably prefer if I got tired faster so I\u2019d join him on the couch for an hour or five of TV, but with my WellnessMat underfoot, I think I\u2019ll stand right here and make another babka.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendRecipes you want to make.
