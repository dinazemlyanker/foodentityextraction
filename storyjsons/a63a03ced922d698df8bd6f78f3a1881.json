Here\u2019s what she\u2019s learned.By Elyse InamineJuly 16, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailAlex LauFacebookTwitterEmailWelcome to Lifers, our column dedicated to the bartenders, porters, hostesses, and more who have made grinding through the restaurant industry their life\u2019s work.Ask for \u201cMama\u201d at Gramercy Tavern in New York City, and everyone knows you\u2019re talking about Carolyn Wandell-Widdoes.For 30 years, she\u2019s been working as a server within the Union Square Hospitality Group, mostly at Union Square Cafe, Danny Meyer\u2019s power lunch spot, and now at Gramercy Tavern, the farm-to-table beacon. If you\u2019ve been to either restaurant, you\u2019ll probably recognize Wandell-Widdoes by her tight blond bun, Cabernet-red lips, flashy earrings, and cat-eye glasses with blue eyes that follow your every move. In a nice way, of course. She\u2019s trying to give you the dining experience of your dreams, and she\u2019s an expert at that.For the first installment of Lifers, we sat down with Wandell-Widdoes to find out how she got her start\u2014and what she\u2019s learned on the job.Setting the table at Gramercy Tavern.\nAlex LauWhat was your first restaurant job?\u201cPeachey\u2019s Ice Cream Family Restaurant in Ringoes, New Jersey. It was kind of similar to Denny\u2019s but more of a family-run restaurant, serving old-fashioned burgers and really great ice cream. I was 16 years old and looking to make some extra money. The best part was putting together \u2018The Pleasurable Suicide\u2019: 20 scoops of ice cream with bananas, wonderful toppings, and whipped cream.\u201dWhat\u2019s the most tips you made in one night?\u201cOh, geez. I remember working at Union Square Cafe on New Year\u2019s Eve sometime in the last century. [Laughs] It\u2019s a pooled house, meaning everyone shares the tips. I made about $400. I\u2019ve always worked in a pooled house type of restaurant, so I never made $1,000 a night or anything like that. With that $400, I paid my American Express bill, so I started the new year right. That\u2019s how I looked at it.\u201dWhen did you realize you wanted to do this for life, and what convinced you to go all in?\u201cI got my social work degree in 1995. Then, my mother got Alzheimer\u2019s, so I needed to help my father and my sister with taking care of her in Upstate New York. Social work means working overtime, so I couldn\u2019t take days off. I started waitressing because it was more flexible and still gave me the salary I needed to make ends meet. Now after many years, I think of hospitality as a kind of social work.\u201d\u201cWhen I first walk over to a table, I say hello and welcome everyone, then I read that \u2018sign.\u2019 Everyone comes in with a sign.\u201d\nAlex LauWhat is the craziest thing that\u2019s happened on the job?\u201cThe day we had a blackout in New York in 2003. I was working the bar during lunch at Union Square Cafe and wondering what we should do. Do I close the cash drawer? Are we closing the restaurant? We ended up closing and prayed that the refrigerators would keep the food fresh. Many of us on staff walked home together over the Brooklyn Bridge. It was very beautiful and unifying.\u201dWhat is the best perk about the job?\u201cWhen I see a returning family and the kids are grown up. I get verklempt. Little kids can be picky eaters, and I always had this one trick up my sleeve at Union Square Cafe: I tell them about the pillowy, marshmallow-y clouds with tomato sauce called gnocchi. They\u2019d look at me, thinking \u2018Can I trust her?\u2019 but end up ordering it. Years later, they come in and tell me, \u2018I\u2019d really like to have that again.\u2019 I love when that happens. It makes me feel like my work is worth it.\u201dWhy does everyone call you \u201cMama\u201d?\u201cI got the nickname from one of the fabulous back waiters at Union Square Cafe. At the end of the night, he would always bring me dessert and I would say \u2018Come to mama!\u2019 He told me that \u2018mama\u2019 means \u2018learned, wise one\u2019 in Swahili, so it became his pet name for me. It just stuck.\u201dOn table dynamics: \u201cSome people want power at a business dinner, and you see everyone at the table consulting with them before talking to me.\u201d\nAlex LauWhat qualities make a good server?\u201cEmpathy. Compassion. Efficiency. Urgency. Grace. Anything can go wrong\u2014a food order incorrectly handled, a drink falling off the tray\u2014so you need to be quick on your feet and reorganize in the moment. One time Danny Meyer asked me, \u2018How do you do this job so well?\u2019 I told him that I imagine myself sitting his seat, thinking, \u2018What would I want?\u2019 and then bring that before he even knows that he needs it. I also told him about Mary Kay and how she had this great philosophy about everyone having an invisible sign that says \u2018Make me feel important.\u2019 As a salesperson, you read how big that sign is for each person. He goes, \u2018I like it!\u2019 That story is in Setting the Table, page 92, and he mentions a \u2018wonderful server.\u2019 That\u2019s me.\u201dWhat is something you are unusually good at now, thanks to this job?\u201cReading people and lifting their spirits. I can only say that because that\u2019s what people tell me. I set the tone for a blissful experience, whether it\u2019s for my guests or my entire restaurant team to work together in harmony. So I look everyone in the eye, ask the hospitality angels for help, and generally send good vibes. And I make sure the water glasses are always filled. Hydration is key.\u201dShe needs to stay hydrated too.\nAlex LauHow have customers changed in the years you\u2019ve been working as a server?\u201cWe\u2019re becoming a more global community now, thanks to things like the Internet. People are much more willing to try new things and \u2018taste\u2019 new cultures, which is exciting. There\u2019s been 180-degree turn. I think the whole hospitality industry has changed, even with #MeToo. We\u2019ve definitely worked with and served people who crossed the line, and in the past, it took too long to get the situation handled. You had to tell your story over and over again and you didn\u2019t always get a respectful follow-through. But it\u2019s finally being addressed, and here at USHG we\u2019ve recently taken a definitive stand on it: There\u2019s a zero-tolerance policy on sexual harassment. Now we feel more validated and heard.\u201dHow have you changed?\u201cI\u2019ve seen it all working in this industry. I\u2019ve touched the lives of over 100,000 people, whether I\u2019ve waitressed their table or served them food. I figured that out about five years ago. I\u2019ve seen people at their best and at their worst. I know I\u2019m not perfect, but I\u2019m definitely a better team player and more compassionate human being because of it.\u201dMeet the man keeping New York City hydrated\u2014with seltzer.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurants + TravelLifersRead MorecultureHow \u2018Sweetbitter\u2019 Compares to Real Fine-Dining Restaurant TrainingBy Alyse WhitneyrestaurantsGeneral Life Advice from the Owner of Portland\u2019s Finest Dive BarBy Marnie HanelcultureOur Staffers' First-Ever Food Jobs, from Dishwashers to Ice Cream ScoopersBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
