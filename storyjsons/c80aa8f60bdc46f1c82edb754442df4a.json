We're here to help.By Alex DelanyMay 17, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Laura MurrayFacebookTwitterEmailI grew up in a bottled salad dressing household. There were brief periods of my life when oil and vinegar would be placed on the table\u2014a nod to health or culture or maybe something else I was missing entirely\u2014but for the most part, when there was salad, there was also a bottle with Paul Newman\u2019s face on it riding shotgun. But these days, I don\u2019t buy bottled salad dressing at all. This isn\u2019t me rebelling against the way my parents raised me. (Love you Mom. Love you Dad.) It\u2019s because making salad dressing at home is 100% better. It\u2019s healthier, more affordable, and more personal. But most importantly, homemade dressing tastes better.Well, mine tastes better now. That was definitely not the case when I first started. The first time I made dressing at home, it was a bland, oily shadow of the stuff I grew up pouring out of the bottle. It was discouraging. I found myself thinking, This is nowhere close to the flavor bomb that comes from the bottle. This kind of sucks. Why does my dressing taste like...nothing? Am I missing something? Should I retire from my brief home cooking career before I embarrass myself even further?And a lot of people feel the same way when it comes to homemade dressing. That's understandable! But I\u2019d like to say that I decided not to retire. I decided to keep making salad dressing. And I\u2019m glad I did, because now I can tell you a few things about why yours might not taste as good as its bottled cousin\u2014and how it can.First things first: Bottled salad dressing has a ton of sugar and salt in it. It\u2019s actually kind of obscene. But that\u2019s why it tastes so good. (Or at least so...much.) Dressing is supposed to season every piece of the salad, so it needs to be concentrated. And that\u2019s the number one mistake people make when making dressing at home. They under-salt and under-sweeten. The day my dressings became great was the day I decided to up the salt and sugar that I mixed into them. Always taste your dressing and add more seasoning, if you need it. It should always taste a smidge too salty and a smidge too sweet, which is okay, because its a sauce\u2014you aren't eating it by the spoonful (hopefully). And if you're worried, even when you get it to that totally delicious place, it will still probably have a lot less salt and sugar than the bottled stuff.Also, you should be dressing a salad with your hands.\nThe other challenge facing amateur dressing makers is consistency. I don\u2019t mean being consistent. I mean the way the dressing feels, texturally. There\u2019s something magical that happens in the bottle that makes the dressing creamy. (Read: weird additives probably.) It makes it seem like it\u2019s not just oil and vinegar hanging out, but rather  one cohesive, brilliant new thing.You can get that texture at home though, sans weird stuff. One way to achieve this is to create a proper emulsion, the way you would if you were making homemade mayonnaise, aioli, or a proper Caesar dressing\u2014more on that here\u2014which involves whisking oil drop-by-drop into vinegar or lemon juice that's been mixed with raw egg yolk. That's kind of the 2.0 option, but will give you an unforgettably rich, creamy dressing. The much easier option, though, is to whisk in something that will simply thicken the ol' oil-and-vinegar-and-whatever-aromatics-you've-got dressing you're already working with. A spoonful of store-bought mayo, good Dijon mustard, Greek yogurt, or tahini will go a long way to creating the silky, lettuce-coating dressing of your dreams. All that said, even if you're just working with a bare-bones, well-seasoned oil and vinegar mixture, giving it a vigorous whisk or shake in a jar right before you dress your salad will give you dressing that at least disperses through a salad evenly.That's how you add the oil slowly. See, easy.\nOnce you have the seasoning and consistency down, and you\u2019ve made a dressing or seven, you should be starting to realize why homemade is the road worth traveling down. The flavor combinations are totally up to you. You can add and tweak ingredients in recipes to align with your taste preferences. You don\u2019t have to go buy another bottle of dressing if you want to change it up. You can just tweak your own house recipe using ingredients you already have. Which means that homemade dressing is actually cheaper. All that stuff in your cabinet can be used in salad dressing. Neat! Rad! Awesome!But the real flex that homemade dressing provides comes when you cook for others. It's impressive. Homemade dressing over-delivers. It\u2019s actually quite easy to assemble and makes you look like a professional. Your bottled dressing friends will be amazed when you casually drop the, \u201cOh, I made that dressing,\u201d in response to Jeremy\u2019s declaration that whatever dressing is on the BLT salad is \u201cbonkers good.\u201d Your friends will see you in a new, well-seasoned, texturally-supreme light.Here's a good place to start:Chopped Dinner Salad with Crispy ChickpeasExactly what you want when dinner NEEDS to be salad, and salad NEEDS to be dinner.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallySalad DressingSaladRecipes you want to make.
