I\u2019ve got some better ideas.By Alex BeggsApril 4, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailEvery Friday morning, Bon App\u00e9tit senior staff writer Alex Beggs shares weekly highlights from the BA offices, from awesome new recipes to office drama to restaurant recs, with some weird (food!) stuff she saw on the internet thrown in. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Raise your hand if you\u2019re cooking for the first timeBlack smoke was billowing out of my friend Will\u2019s oven when his roommate realized it was probably time to call the fire department. Grease at the bottom of the oven, from Will\u2019s first steak the night before, was the culprit. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to clean that before you use the oven, I guess,\u201d was what he learned about cooking this week. Once the oven was clean (\u201cI went full French maid on it\u201d), he roasted some frozen broccoli. Another first.I\u2019m so proud and happy for Will, who otherwise loves a good low-carb frozen dinner and refers to his Instagram followers as his \u201cdisciples\u201d lol. He\u2019s learning to cook, because what the hell else are you going to do right now?! And there\u2019s not one path to doing so. I\u2019m sure hundreds of cookbooks would argue otherwise, but from my experience, the best way to learn how to cook is to cook what you want to eat. I don\u2019t want to learn how to make chicken pot pie because frankly I hate it! I skipped that chapter and I turned out just fine.On that note, I\u2019m going to dedicate this newsletter to Will. Okay, and for anyone else who is getting sick of all the Stouffer\u2019s french bread pizzas. Who isn\u2019t sure how to boil water. Who needs to feed themself, but not elaborately. As they say on the Internet: I love this journey for you.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Start with something nutritionally terrible for youA pot of queso. A buttery pound cake. A batch of chocolate chip cookies. Adult mac n cheese (pasta queso). A properly microwaved hot dog (poke holes in it so it won\u2019t explode).The junk food will make you happy. You\u2019ll be fed and rewarded. Some people say the first thing they learned to cook was a nice vinaigrette. Excuse me, I don\u2019t want to celebrate my independence with a SALAD. Oh wow this salad is positively palatable! Can\u2019t wait to do it again! Wahh. Pass. Salads can come later, and I\u2019d suggest going full green goddess before you\u2019ve decided to emulsify boring ol\u2019 oil.The first thing I cooked for myself when I was 22 was a tray of nachos, and it was a huge learning moment when I realized that preheating the oven matters (you\u2019ll never forget rubbery nachos), and that it was important to wait for the cheese to bubble to signify they were ready. That\u2019s the kind of nuance I could handle.Take on a huge project that\u2019ll go wrong in 17 different waysA chocolate cake. Focaccia. Lamb tagine. A roast chicken. These are simple recipes, but the results are dramatic. Just go for it. Take the leap, see what happens. If 17 things go wrong, you\u2019ll remember each one and next time will go smoother. If everything turns out, you\u2019ll feel like a fucking CHAMPION. Skip the composed weeknight sheet-pan dinners. Go for the gold.Ted CavanaughMake a drinkMost classic cocktails are three ingredients and delicious. Mix it in your Hydroflask for all I care! Plus, you get a little buzz as a reward. Pro tip: Any time a cocktail recipe calls for simple syrup, I sprinkle a little sugar in the shaker and hope for the best. Works every time.Get the recipe: Whiskey SourPhoto by Chelsie Craig, food styling by Rebecca JurkevichGet acquainted with ground meatIf you\u2019re a meat-eater who\u2019s never actually cooked meat, as I was, ground meat is your entry point. These flavor-packed chicken lettuce wraps, specifically (if your condiment situation is stocked). Then simple Japanese soboro beef. Then Andy\u2019s lamb meatballs. Then a bolognese-type thing. You don\u2019t have the weirdly shaped body parts to stress over, you don\u2019t have to poke a hot steak in a pan and wonder if it\u2019s still raw or far past well-done. You don\u2019t need an actual knife.Photo by Emma Fishman, Food Styling by Sue LiAsk for helpIt\u2019s usually faster than falling down a reddit thread trying to figure out if you can use yogurt in place of sour cream (you usually can). I have three cooking friends who I regularly text when I have a question like, \u201ccan I use ground cardamom if I don\u2019t have pods\u201d and \u201cwhy is my fried rice so mushy?\u201d Sometimes they ignore me or get back to me too late but sometimes they don\u2019t!!! And hey, if you\u2019re planning on making a BA recipe like that beautiful cod and tomato curry pictured above, DM the recipe author on Instagram and see if they reply (please, though, not mid-cooking). The more specific the question, the better. Don\u2019t be creepy.I have a hundred other thoughts but my word count\u2019s up. But hey. This cooking thing is going to be messy. You\u2019re going to forget to read the recipe all the way through and realize something has to rest overnight. You\u2019re going to substitute a ton of ingredients and wonder why the recipe sucked (it was the Stevia). Smoke will billow. Rice will be mushy! Cakes will definitely be dry. And you can decide to forge ahead, or not, and get back to those frozen pizzas. You have the right.Quick q for ya: What Bon App\u00e9tit recipes are you cooking in your isolation time?
