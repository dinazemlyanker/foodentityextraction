I simply have never had better fried chicken and I consider myself a fried chicken connoisseur.  Loved the spice, divine.  brushjlsolon, oh1/23/2021Amaze. Start to end. The marinade itself is so delicious and aromatic and spicy. I fried it without potato starch and it came out just fine. Will be making oftennyancatIndia6/20/2020Substitution help: During a pandemic, you work with what you have, I hope this helps you too:\nChaat Masala substitute: combine cumin, coriander finely crushed with sandwich bag and rolling pin.  Ajwain,  I used zaatar, Hing I used onion powder, amchur I used Lemon pepper which gave me the salt and black pepper I also needed.  \nKashmiri substitute: 3 parts paprika 1 part cayenne but we like it spicy so we did half and half.  \nOf course, you taste everything as you go.  It all tastes like a taquitos chips.  My husband loved it.STEFHANNARChicago4/16/2020Made this the other night and it was delicious! One comment though, if you fry in smaller batches (about 3-4 pieces at a time) then the amount of dredge is completely excessive as I ended up throwing out at leave 3-4 cups of it.AnonymousDurham, NC3/29/2020Ohh, we love ADDA and Chicken Masala ( and Fried Chicken, of course). Super excited to make this super delicious recipe this weekend!Moji MasalaNew York, NY3/12/2020This recipe had BOMB flavor! I actually used bone-in chicken, which just makes the cooking time a bit longer, but I found this recipe easier than expected to execute. I was able to find the spices at my local Indian grocery store, and I was surprised the Kashmiri chili powder I used did taste pretty spicy on it's own, so I backed off a bit from what the recipe recommended, however when these were finished, they were the perfect level of spice for me personally. The amchur and yogurt gives a nice tang to balance out the flavors. I don't think this recipe is suitable for baking (to the below poster) because the batter is far too thick for it to crisp up in the oven. AnonymousClevealnd, Ohio3/3/2020Definitely will do this recipe next weekend. But wondering...Why not mix the amchur, chaat masla, chili and pepper directly into the flour mixture?1/28/2020Would be nice to know how long to bake the chicken in the oven....AnonymousVienna1/27/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titFried ChickenIndianSouth AsianAsianChicken ThighChickenPoultryMainNut-FreeDeep-fryDinnerRecipes you want to make.
