This dish is a vessel for some of the Caribbean\u2019s finest flavors, like bright and punchy herbs, spicy-sweet aromatics, and grassy coconut milk\u2014but it\u2019s also a reflection of the multicultural society of the twin-island republic and a mirror of the rich diversity of island life. Read more about the history of pelau\u2014and why it\u2019s the unofficial national dish of Trinidad and Tobago\u2014here.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

What's more, having made this dish, the recipe is legit and it is hands down the most delicious, rice based stir fry we've ever tasted.AnonymousUnited States via Kingston, Jamaica3/22/2022I wish I'd read all the reviews before spending 16$ on beef to cook in a bowl of hard carrots and mushy peas\nnot too happyUnited States3/20/2022Really love this piece of writing, cast me straight back to the Caribbean. I love pelau and cook it with chicken. \n\nEvery Caribbean household has its own nuances, rice and peas for example can be red kidney beans in one household, and pigeon peas in another. The Caribbean is a real melting pot of techniques and flavours, I love this rendition, well done Brigid.DeeLondon3/20/2022Winner!!! I have made pelau before but it never tasted as good as when my mom makes it. I followed this recipe and it was perfect. My son loved it. Like many kids he is a picky eater but he ate 2 bowl fulls. Definitely replacing my old recipe. \nI appreciate the chef sharing the history of the dish, I never really thought about it before but I have a renewed appreciation for the dish to go along with the great new recipe. I really loved the part about her mom and thinking about her mom, it was heartwarming. Thank you for sharing a little history and some delicious food.AnonymousToronto, Canada3/20/2022Just an amazing piece of writing and history on such a Trinidadian and Caribbean staple. So vivid and full of nostalgia, I love this recipe.  When I saw the article I knew I had to make this coming Sunday and so I did.  Came out just right, perfect in fact.  Wife and little one absolutely loved it.  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful dish Brigid...can't wait for more of your recipes to try. Keep them coming!!!!\"ReynoldBasel, Switzerland3/20/2022What Ian said....Also, we season with pimentos, not scotch bonnets, what you described would make a dish that's painful to eat.AnonymousTrinidad3/20/2022looks really tasty, I\u2019m going to try it but with Ian\u2019s additional notes. I like the fact he would use much less sugar AprilUK 3/20/2022This recipe seems gussied up for a Bon appetit photo and article. No problem there. However, note: Pelau is of East African origin. Rice existed in Trinidad before the arrival of East Indians. Fact: African slaves - Amerikins - that arrived in Trinidad (1776-77) from the US  following the US War of Independence, long before the arrival of East Indians in Trinidad, brought with them Red rice, which is grown in Trinidad. Red rice is well known to be the sole rice that can be grown on dry land. Further, use of canned pigeon peas cooked for over an hour in that much liquid will result in a very soft almost mush-like meal. 1/2 cup of brown sugar is way too much. For 3Lbs of beef; two table spoons of sugar - brown or white granulated sugar - and two table spoons of vegetable oil is sufficient for browning. Otherwise you end up with a sweet meal. A great Pelau is almost dry with each grain of rice easily separated from the other much like uncooked rice. As such, if using canned peas, one must add late in the cooking process along with the rice using just enough liquid to cover the combined dry ingredients. Bring all combined ingredients to the boil, cook at the boil for now-two minutes, then cover and leave to simmer over very low or, preferably, no heat for twenty minutes. Note; the relatively  large-cut carrots shown here will also need to be cooked initially along with the beef minus rice and peas as it will take longer to cook that the latter two ingredients.IanTrinidad3/19/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titDinnerMainNut-FreeDairy-FreeOne-Pot MealsSimmerSaut\u00e9TrinidadianCaribbeanRiceRice & GrainsPigeon PeaBeanVegetableCarrotBeefMeatCoconut MilkOther IngredientsRecipes you want to make.
