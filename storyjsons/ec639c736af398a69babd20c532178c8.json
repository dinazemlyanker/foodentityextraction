Feel free to use any flavor ice cream for the center. We prefer to use a kitchen torch to brown the meringue, but in a pinch you can brown the baked Alaskas under a broiler\u2014just watch them very carefully and rotate often.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Butter a rimmed 18x13\" baking sheet or lightly coat with nonstick spray. Line with parchment paper; lightly butter or coat parchment and dust lightly with flour, tapping out excess. Whisk together eggs, egg yolk, buttermilk, coffee, oil, and vanilla extract in a medium bowl.Step 2Mix granulated sugar, cocoa powder, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and 1\u00be cups (219 g) flour in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment on low speed until combined, about 1 minute. Add egg mixture in 3 additions, beating on medium speed 30 seconds after each addition. Add melted chocolate and beat, scraping down sides of bowl to ensure everything is well mixed.Step 3Scrape batter into prepared baking sheet and rap on counter to level. Bake cake until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 20\u201325 minutes. Let cake cool 15 minutes, then run an offset spatula along edges to loosen. Set a wire rack upside down over baking sheet and flip over to release cake. Carefully peel away parchment paper and let cool completely.Meringue and AssemblyStep 4Transfer cake to a cutting board. Cut out 12 rounds with cookie cutter (leftover scraps are for snacking). Top 6 cake rounds with a 1 Tbsp. dollop of jam each; sandwich with remaining cake rounds. Place each cake sandwich on an 8\" square of plastic wrap (lightly moistening the counter will help plastic stay flat).Step 5Just before serving, heat egg whites, granulated sugar, and cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer set over a saucepan of barely simmering water (do not let bowl touch water), whisking constantly, until sugar is dissolved and an instant-read thermometer registers 120\u00b0, 5\u20137 minutes.Step 6Soften ice cream just enough to be able to scoop with a #8 ice cream scoop (or a heaping \u00bd cup). Arrange a scoop of ice cream, flat side down, on top of each cake sandwich. Pull plastic wrap up and around cake and ice cream and twist to seal tightly. Freeze until ice cream is very hard, at least 1 hour.Step 7Fit bowl onto stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, add vanilla extract, and beat on medium-high speed until meringue forms stiff, glossy peaks, about 5 minutes.Step 8Unwrap ice cream domes and place on individual heatproof plates. Working quickly, spread meringue over domes with a spoon or small offset spatula, making lots of decorative swirls and peaks all over. (You can also use a pastry bag fitted with a large fluted tip and pipe meringue over each dome.) Make sure all of the ice cream and cake is covered. Toast meringue with kitchen torch until golden.Do ahead: Ice cream domes can be assembled 3 days ahead. Keep frozen. Cover with meringue and toast just before serving.Recipes adapted with permission from \u2018Cheryl Day\u2019s Treasury of Southern Baking\u2019 by Cheryl Day (Artisan Books).

I followed the recipe but made some changes which I think will be helpful: I made the cake and followed the directions, once the cake cooled I cut out the 3 inch diameter individual cakes. I cut each cake in half horizontally so I ended up with a lot of little cakes which I froze and will use for my next dinner party. I mixed the raspberry jam with some Grand Marnier and spread that between the layers. I made homemade vanilla ice cream and a scoop was perfect. I froze them overnight and made the topping after dinner, it made so much. But it was a perfect dessert and so delicious. I make large Baked Alaska's all the time and this was quite fun. Everyone raved. My next dinner party in New Year's Eve and I will make this again with my homemade salted caramel ice cream e TraversoSonoma CA12/26/2021Why is there no print option?AnonymousAtlanta12/19/2021Steps 5 and 6 need to be reversed.AnonymousHartford CT11/17/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titDessertBakeButterCoffeeAlcohol & Other DrinksChocolateOther IngredientsJamCakeEggRecipes you want to make.
