She\u2019d slice thick slabs of juicy heirlooms, slather them with mayo and Italian herbs, then line them up on her antique blue glass platter before leaving the house. In transit, the salt would pull out the tomato\u2019s juices which would then mingle with the mayo. The result was a beautiful mess of juice and cream\u2014kind of like a BLT without the bacon.Ingredients8\u201310 servings2lb. heirloom tomatoes (about 3), sliced \u00bc\" thickFlaky sea saltFresh ground black pepper3Tbsp. mayonnaise1Tbsp. coarsely chopped basil1Tbsp. coarsely chopped oregano1Tbsp. coarsely chopped parsley2Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oilPreparationStep 1Season tomatoes with sea salt and pepper.

Made exactly according to the recipe the first time and it was yummy!  The second time I added a clove of crushed garlic and a squirt of lemon juice to the mayo and it was even better.

Right up there with peaches in cream.AnonymousLexington, SC4/12/2021YES!!  What a wonderful use of homegrown tomatoes.  My favorite part of a tomato sandwich is usually the tomato/mayo combo, so this is a dream come true.  Wouldn't change a thing.AnonymousIndianapolis9/24/2020Love love love love love. Obviously quality tomatoes weigh heavily into the satisfaction of this recipe - but it offers the same fresh, herby, creamy deliciousness of a caprese salad without being so unoriginal. And it kicks up the umami just a notch, which I love. AnonymousSan Diego8/11/2020As delicious as it is beautiful. The perfect use of tomatoes from the garden.
