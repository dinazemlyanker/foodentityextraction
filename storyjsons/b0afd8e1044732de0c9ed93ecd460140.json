Even if the hummus looks smooth after just 3 or 4 minutes of food processing, go for the full 8. It might seem excessive (and loud), but all that whipping is what makes the dip so irresistibly creamy.IngredientsMakes about 4 cupsDukkah\u2153cup raw pistachios6Tbsp. coriander seeds\u00bccup cumin seeds\u00bdcup sesame seeds1tsp. kosher salt\u00bdtsp. freshly ground black pepperHummus and Assembly1\u00bccups dried chickpeas, soaked overnight in cold water, or 2\u00bd cups canned chickpeas1Tbsp. plus \u00be tsp. kosher salt, plus more2garlic cloves\u2154cup tahini (preferably Soom)\u2153cup plus 2 Tbsp.

Mix in salt and pepper.Step 5Do Ahead: Dukkah can be made 2 weeks ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.Hummus and AssemblyStep 6If using dried chickpeas, drain, reserving \u2153 cup soaking liquid, and rinse. Place in a large pot and pour in water to cover by at least 4\". Bring to a boil and cook until tender, 50\u201360 minutes. Stir in 1 Tbsp. salt.

Process until chickpeas are coarsely chopped, then, with motor running, gradually stream in reserved chickpea soaking liquid or \u2153 cup water and process until hummus is extremely smooth and creamy, 8\u201310 minutes. Taste and season with more salt, lemon, and/or cayenne.Step 8Transfer hummus to a bowl, drizzle with more oil, and sprinkle with plenty of dukkah (you\u2019ll have some left over; keep it around for using on salads, roasted vegetables, slow-roasted salmon).Step 9Do Ahead: Hummus can be made 1 week ahead. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing directly against surface (or cover with a thin layer of oil) to prevent skin from forming, and chill.How would you rate Hummus With Pistachio Dukkah?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleHey if you don\u2019t have the coriander & cumin seeds, does anyone know what would be the equivalent amount of already ground spices for the dukkah? Thank you AngieHurleyville, NY1/31/2021if you don't have a food processor (or if the one you have just SUCKS), try peeling your chickpeas once they're cooked (if using canned, simply reserve the liquid, thoroughly rinse the chickpeas, and peel). it's tedious as hell, but you'll get a very smooth result that uses less electricity and puts less strain on your gadgets. if you have extra aquafaba (chickpea liquid) left over, try saving it as an egg replacer.
