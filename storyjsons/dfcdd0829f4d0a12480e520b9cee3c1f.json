You might never be able to try it.By Marissa A. RossJune 18, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Katie BennFacebookTwitterEmailHey! I\u2019m Marissa Ross, Bon Appetit\u2019s wine editor, and welcome to the new home of my column, Unfiltered, here on Healthyish. This is where I\u2019ll be sharing my latest favorite bottles and\u2014you guessed it\u2014unfiltered thoughts on wine. Please come in, grab a glass, make yourself comfortable. The bathroom is the first door on the right.The first time I tasted Alex Craighead\u2019s Kindeli wines was at Percy Selections\u2019 Los Angeles trade tasting last June, and I had no recourse but to run off with the bottles. I yelled for permission to no one in particular, without caring if I got it, and was out the back door of Bar Bandini like I was going to slide over the hood of a \u201969 Dodge Charger for a dramatic getaway. I settled for a sunny spot on the porch, where I could write about the wines without being crammed crotch-to-butt against buyers wearing too much cologne and yelling at each other over Tame Impala. I finished my notes and snapped a photo before returning the bottles to the bar, nervous I\u2019d never see the small-production New Zealand wines again. Unable to control myself, I posted the photo on Instagram and proceeded to piss people off because the wines weren\u2019t available retail yet, and when the limited amount finally was, it sold out in a matter of weeks.Kindeli is one of the only true natural wines being imported from New Zealand, where it\u2019s made with organically farmed fruit and no sulfur additions. But that isn\u2019t enough to make me impulsively abscond with bottles at an industry event; it was the incredible cohesiveness of the line-up that did that. Despite being insane blends that you would never expect to fit together, the vintage had a beautiful through-line that smelled and tasted like taking one more step down a tropical garden path lined with roses.Drinking wine is not about having a specific bottle. Drinking wine is about having an experience.Kindeli\u2019s 2018 vintage arrived along with spring, and while I could take off into the night with any of the releases, the \u201cOto\u00f1o\u201d got me good. I didn\u2019t realize how much I missed summer until I poured myself a glass of the Gew\u00fcrztraminer blended with Riesling and Pinot Gris. It looks like a sepia-toned late Sunday afternoon through your favorite cheap sunglasses and smells of ripe mangoes and tea roses in peak bloom, soft in the heat. Drinking it is like taking all those mangoes and roses, whipping them up with pulpy guava, and shaking it all up with hot gravel before garnishing with an orange rind. \u201cOto\u00f1o\u201d is an old Polaroid that you never took; a portrait of life in the sun where day jobs and disputes have never existed, and every last dime was spent on gas, grass, and general gallivanting.The good news: The Kindeli wines are more widely available this year than last, and I hope you get to try them. The bad news: There\u2019s a chance you may not. Honestly, there\u2019s a good chance you won\u2019t even see many of the wines I write about. This is a complaint I\u2019ve gotten regularly since starting at BA in 2016. Whether it\u2019s from my bosses or our readers or even Instagram followers who see photos like the one I posted of the Kindeli wines last summer, people become frustrated when they can\u2019t find the bottles I\u2019m recommending. I get it, especially in the age of social media, where certain wines seem to be all over your feed but nowhere to be found in real life.The truth is we\u2019re in similar situations. I generally buy the bottles I write about at retail because contrary to popular belief, I\u2019m not out here swimming in free wine. This means we\u2019re both limited to what is available around us. Granted, I live in Los Angeles, where natural wine is abundant, so I\u2019m lucky, but there are still plenty of wines I see all my East Coast friends drinking that will never make it onto a shelf in California. I used to get envious (okay, I still do sometimes), but if writing about wine has taught me anything, it\u2019s that drinking wine is not about having a specific bottle. Drinking wine is about having an experience.I write about wines I have to write about. Not because it\u2019s my job, but because I physically can\u2019t not write about them. They\u2019re wines that bring me (notebook in tow) to my knees. Wines that have caused me to collapse onto cold Spanish tiles in the middle of a dinner party because they transport me to the pink lemonade I drank after swim practice; wines that pull me to sit on wet cellar floors and write about lovers I\u2019ve never had. Those are the kind of wines I write about.That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to have the same reaction. Maybe it\u2019s bottle variation, or maybe you don\u2019t like it because you just don\u2019t like it. There are plenty of wines I don\u2019t like. One of the most popular bottles of natural wine over the last two years I consider so undrinkable that it has made me question whether I should start writing negative reviews. I don\u2019t, though, because that wine\u2014and many others\u2014brings people joy. Just like the wines I write about bring me joy.That\u2019s what I want you to take from this column. Of course I want you to try all the wines I write about, and if your wine shop doesn\u2019t carry them, ask for them because (a) people can\u2019t supply if they don\u2019t know there\u2019s a demand and (b) in the meantime, they can point you in the direction of something similar. Maybe they don\u2019t have the Kindeli wines, but they might have other natural blends from neighboring Australia or interesting skin-contact Gew\u00fcrztraminer, Rieslings, or Pinot Gris. But the truth is, even if you drank the exact same bottle of Kindeli\u2019s \u201cOtono\u201d that I drank, you may not feel the same way about it that I do. And that\u2019s okay. Because I want to inspire you to seek out wines that bring you joy. That take you somewhere new or remind you of something you love.It\u2019s easy to fetishize bottles, especially ones that people praise and that have beautiful labels, like Kindeli with its painted topless foxes. But drinking wine isn\u2019t about drinking what everyone else is; it\u2019s about drinking wines that give you\u2014and maybe only you\u2014a fantastic experience.Explore Bon App\u00e9titUnfiltered natural wineHealthyishWineRead MoreLifestyleWe'll Be Drinking Co-Fermented Wines All Summer LongBy Marissa A.
