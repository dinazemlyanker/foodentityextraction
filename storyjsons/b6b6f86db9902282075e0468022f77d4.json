Almost all of them were mostly doomed as soon as the location was chosen. There was the too-bright Spanish restaurant with a drink called \u201cAPHRODISIAC.\u201d The trendy coffee shop that had no indoor seating on a frigid 40-degree day. And the piano bar that, you know, was a piano bar. So if there\u2019s one thing that a lot of Very Bad first dates have taught me, it\u2019s this: Find one Very Good first date location, and hold on to it as tight as you can. And for me, that spot is The Ten Bells on New York\u2019s Lower East Side.Opened in 2008, The Ten Bells is a dark and vibe-y natural wine and tapas bar that feels more Paris than New York City. It\u2019s anchored by a big horseshoe-shaped bar that\u2019s operated by knowledgeable (but not in a snooty way) bartenders/wine freaks. Best of all, though, it meets all my qualifications for a Very Good first date location. First, the lighting is A+. I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m vain and don\u2019t want to sit under interrogation-style fluorescent lights on a first date. The dim, red-ish glow here is straight up sexy. Next, the wine list rules. Feeling by the glass? They have over 20 options to choose from, with a huge focus on natural wines produced from organic and biodynamic grapes. Date going well and want a bottle? They\u2019ve got a wide selection to choose from\u2014and ones for as little as $39 (a rare and affordable price in this city). Finally, there is the option to order food, which is essential, because it\u2019s VERY important to have options (read: escape routes) on a first date. Committing to an entire dinner pretty much erases all possible outs until dessert, which is why choosing a bar that has snacks (or tapas, in this case) is key. If\u2014and only if\u2014the conversation is flowing, order the Spanish tortilla, some croquettes, and marinated olives. Also important: There\u2019s usually no wait, and if there is, you can camp out on the perimeter of the room with some wine until another couple gets up. They are very good about making sure you always have water in your cup (hydration while drinking multiple glasses of wine is honestly very important). The music is noticeably good (think: Velvet Underground) but not yell-over-it loud. And soon you can have your first dates in Brooklyn too, when they open their second location in Bushwick this summer.So, was this a PSA for all my future first date suitors? Maybe. But if I\u2019ve managed to save just one other person from a Very Bad first date location\u2026 well, then my job here is done.Go there: The Ten BellsExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendNew YorkBarsRecipes you want to make.
