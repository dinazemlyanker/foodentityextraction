Case in point, the popularity of our Salted Caramel Apple Cookies online and the feverish hunt for more irresistible cookie recipes that followed. We found them in an array of new cookbooks and decided to share our favorites for the holidays.\u00a0When a tray of all the cookies was brought down from our test kitchen\u2014which has finally reopened!\u2014I took more than my share of Dorie Greenspan\u2019s Iced Spiced Hermits. I hope no one was counting. Also impressive was the Pink Grapefruit Sugar Cookie, pictured above, from Jesse Szewczyk\u2019s cookbook, Cookies: The New Classics.Cookies: The New Classics$28 $23 at AmazonWe\u2019re also drawn to cookbook author Ayesha Curry, who designed a gorgeous menu for this year\u2019s festivities. The Prime Rib Roast With Habanero Crema is succulent, tender, and paired with an easy side of cabbage and carrots (made fancy by a boost of aromatics and allspice). A colorful salad topped with a bright citrus dressing and a sticky-sweet rum cake round out the meal.As writer Elizabeth Acevedo reminds us in her essay for our column \u201cAll on the Table,\u201d it\u2019s non-materialistic things like family\u2014and who is headlining in the kitchen\u2014that matter most this time of year.
