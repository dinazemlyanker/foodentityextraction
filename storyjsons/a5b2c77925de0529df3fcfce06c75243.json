The trick to getting enough of the bittersweet coffee flavor into the ladyfingers is dunking them until they are soaked but removing them just before they start to fall apart. Squish them as needed to fit into the pan.Ingredients8 servings Vegetable oil (for pan)1\u00bdcups very strong coffee, cooled1Tbsp. dark rumPinch of kosher salt1Tbsp. plus \u2153 cup sugar1cup chilled heavy cream\u00bdcup mascarpone3large egg yolks24ladyfingersCocoa powder (for dusting)PreparationStep 1Lightly oil a 9x5\" loaf pan and line with plastic wrap, leaving plenty of overhang. Whisk coffee, rum, salt, and 1 Tbsp. sugar in a shallow dish until sugar and salt dissolve. Chill until ready to use.Step 2Whisk cream and mascarpone in a medium bowl just until smooth. Set aside.Step 3Pour water into a large saucepan to come 2\" up the sides and bring to a simmer. Combine egg yolks, remaining \u2153 cup sugar, and 2 Tbsp. water in a medium heatproof bowl. Set bowl over pan and reduce heat to low so water is at a bare simmer. Using an electric mixer (or a large whisk and a friend to fill in when your arm cramps), beat mixture on medium-high until eggs triple in volume and are extremely pale yellow and mixture forms a slowly dissolving ribbon when drizzled over itself in bowl, 5\u20137 minutes. Remove bowl from heat.Step 4Using clean beaters (or whisk), beat reserved cream mixture until medium peaks form. Add egg yolk mixture and gently fold until no streaks remain.Step 5Working one at a time, dip ladyfingers into chilled coffee mixture and let soak just long enough for them to soften, 1\u20132 seconds per side. Lay 8 cookies in prepared pan (it\u2019s okay to smush them in a bit). Spread one-third of filling over. Layer another 8 soaked ladyfingers on top and spread half of remaining filling over. Repeat layers one more time with remaining ladyfingers and filling. Cover pan with plastic wrap; chill tiramis\u00f9 until firm, at least 6 hours and up to 12 hours (longer is better; you\u2019ll get cleaner slices and the layers will be fully set).Step 6Invert a small platter or a large plate over top of loaf pan, hold together tightly, and flip them over so plate is underneath. Set on a work surface and carefully remove pan. Peel away plastic wrap from tiramis\u00f9; discard. Generously dust tiramis\u00f9 with cocoa powder. Serve in slices, dusting with more cocoa powder if desired.Step 7Do Ahead: Tiramis\u00f9 (without cocoa powder) can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.How would you rate Old-School Tiramis\u00f9?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (9)Back to TopTriangleOL from Europe: 1 cup equal 250mL, so 1 1/2 cup is 375mL. JudithMontreal9/23/2021OL from Europe - this recipe apparently comes from America so you will have US measurements.  We have the same problem here with European recipes that are in metric.  Guess you just have to find a conversion table.  Good Luck!Anonymous3/30/2021OL-Europe: One cup is 8 ounces. One and a half cup is 12 ounces. This measurement is not critical because you will not use all of the coffee since it is just for dipping the ladyfingers. The metric system is easier to use but there may be a website for an easy conversion to metric equivalents. In this case, use12 ounces to convert to metric system.AnnCalifornia3/30/2021The recipe I use came from my ex's Italian grandmother.  It is essentially the same but uses only mascarpone and whipped egg whites instead of yolks.  Could this be a regional difference?   I shamlessly changed the rum to kaluha.  CynthiaPark City, UT12/30/2020How much coffee is \"1\u00bd cup\"? Seems like there is no one specific answer to that hence why you should STOP USING AMERICAN MEASURING UNITS IN ALL YOUR RECIPES \n\nThey're illogical and stupid and there is NO reason to not phase them out in favour of metrics so the rest of the world can follow as well\n\nPlease please please do it OlEurope12/30/2020Don't sleep on this recipe - it is the best way to make homemade tiramisu with minimal fuss. I have to refrigerate for the full 12 hours to keep its shape when cut - but worth the wait!TeddySan Francisco, CA11/20/2020What do medium peaks with mascarpone and whipped cream look like? The mascarpone  and heavy cream pretty much turn to a dry cottage cheese type consistency. I have to assume I\u2019m doing something wrong, but next time I\u2019m going to whip the cream separately. A learning experience but a waste of $20 in cream and mascarpone.AnonymousCincinnati 7/19/2020Holy sh*t! This is delicious. Thank you, based Chris Morocco. A show stopper for sure. And, a way to catch up on missed carbs in quarantine... if that was ever a problem.boulezLos Angeles5/3/2020Though there are a lot of steps it\u2019s overall a simple recipe. This is a go to recipe for me! It\u2019s got the best flavor and it\u2019s always a hit.
