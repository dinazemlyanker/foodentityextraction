I haven't bought dukkah before, but I imagine it would have a more complex taste than grinding up just peanuts, coriander and cumin. If you can find some at the speciality store, I'd definitely make this combination again.AnonymousNew Haven, CT8/27/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titGreekEuropeanNorth AfricanAfricanHalloumiCheeseStarterSnackHealthyishDinnerRecipes you want to make.
