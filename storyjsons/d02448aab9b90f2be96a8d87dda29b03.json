Bees make the golden pellets from foraged pollen to feed to their babies while humans looking for the next big superfood use it to top acai bowls, multigrain porridges, and other brunch staples. Go figure. The slightly sweet, musty-in-a-good-way granules are high in antioxidants and thought to help ward off seasonal allergies, which is why I stashed a jar in my pantry to zhuzh up my oatmeal last year. But after several months of forgetting to sprinkle it on anything, I realized there\u2019s only one way I would actually consume bee pollen: when encased in chocolate.It looks like a bee but tastes like fruity chocolate.\nEmma FishmanThis realization came to me when BA\u2019s deputy editor Julia Kramer handed me a bar from Cloudforest, a bean-to-bar chocolate company based in Portland, Oregon, and helmed by Ecuadorian chocolatier Sebastian Cisneros. He merges single-estate Ecuadorian cacao with a lineup of ingredients that reads like a millennial Willy Wonka fever dream\u2014palo santo, Pop Rocks, black sesame, piment\u00f3n. It\u2019s all exciting, but I\u2019m especially fond of the bee pollen, which is harvested by Jacobsen Co. Honey, a hive program operated by Jacobsen Salt Co that works with sustainable beekeepers in the Pacific Northwest.The contrast between fruity pollen and creamy milk chocolate is undeniably delicious\u2014even for someone like myself who proudly swears allegiance to the dark side (of chocolate). It certainly doesn\u2019t count as a supplement, but it\u2019s just about the only kind of sweet I\u2019m willing to gift this Valentine\u2019s Day.Buy it: Cloudforest Bee, $8 at CloudforestAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
