I find myself there often, snatching up dumplings for dinner emergencies, ice cream for emotional emergencies, and frozen spinach. Yep, that\u2019s right: One of the frozen foods we endorse here at Basically is spinach. Don\u2019t get us wrong, we still like its fresh counterpart for some things, but sometimes frozen is, in fact, better.Frozen spinach can be subbed in pretty much any place you\u2019d normally be cooking raw spinach. And since raw spinach is watery, you\u2019ll probably need to cook it down anyway\u2014otherwise, it\u2019ll release its water and change the texture and flavor of your finished dish. Since frozen spinach is blanched (that is, boiled briefly in very hot water and then submerged in cold water to stop the cooking and retain the color) before it\u2019s packaged, it's like a shortcut.Frozen spinach is also space efficient (have you ever tried to cram two pounds of the fresh stuff into your fridge?) and it lasts for months. Whether you\u2019re whipping up a dip for last-minute guests or you want something nutritious (that is, green) to add to your omelette, frozen spinach is there for you.Okay, so you\u2019re convinced. You're practically Popeye! But now you need to know how to use frozen spinach. The cooking instructions on the back of the package can be misleading, asking you to re-boil or microwave the greens for an inordinate amount of time. And if the greens are already cooked, do you need to thaw them at all?In the case of soup, no. A little extra water never hurt a broth. But when it comes to pretty much everything else\u2014be it eggs, quesadillas, or skillet pizza\u2014moisture is the enemy, so you\u2019re going to want to let the spinach thaw. Then grab it by the fistful, squeeze out all the water (it helps if you wrap it in a kitchen towel), and add it in.Even with the extra step of thawing, nothing beats delicious greens at arms reach. Just make sure you leave room for the ice cream you\u2019ll inevitably grab when you\u2019re in the freezer section.Get the recipe:Spinach and Feta Tarte SoleilThe most impressive appetizer to \u201ccasually\u201d pull out of the oven when your friends come over (and it also happens to make a nice Thanksgiving snack for while the turkey rests\u2014just sayin').View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titSpinachRecipes you want to make.
