But when you pick up a dud that turns out mealy, mushy, and bland, it can put you off tomatoes for a while. Until someone invents a Good Tomato/Bad Tomato app (please, no), you\u2019ll have to rely on your old-fashioned senses to select the juiciest, most flavorful specimens. These tips will keep you on the right track toward tomato bliss, whether you\u2019re at the supermarket or farmers market.Look localIf you\u2019re fortunate enough to live in or close to a tomato-growing region in the country, your best bet is to seek out locally grown tomatoes in the height of summer, when they\u2019re at their peak. The most excellent tomatoes are almost always going to be the ones that have traveled the shortest distance, and are more likely to be ripened on the vine rather than in the back of a refrigerated truck.Hold but do not squeezeYou\u2019ve got to pick \u2019em up! Smaller tomatoes should be firm but not hard; larger tomatoes should feel heavy for their size and neither too solid nor too soft or swollen. (Remember: They\u2019ll continue to ripen on your counter at home.)Seek out tomatoes that are uniformly ripeAvoid tomatoes that have hard or pale spots near the stem as well as ones with large bruises or cracks that are too long or deep to trim away. They should be shiny, with a smooth, uniform skin.Take a whiffIf you\u2019re not getting much of an aroma, it\u2019s likely the tomato is underripe. A great tomato should smell floral and almost basil-y\u2014you\u2019ll know it when you smell it.Embrace the rainbowDuring peak season (mid- to late-summer is when tomatoes are at their best) is when you\u2019re most likely to come across a variety of multicolored tomato varieties at the farmers market or in the produce aisles. They all have their own, distinct flavors worth trying out: Orange and yellow tomatoes are often less acidic (read: milder and sweeter) than their darker, redder counterparts.If it\u2019s not summer, choose cherriesWhen you need an off-season tomato, the smaller ones are your best bet. Because they\u2019re less likely to bruise in transport, smaller varieties like cherry tomatoes can ripen on the vine longer before being harvested, which means they\u2019re usually more flavorful than their larger counterparts. When given the choice between cherry and grape, go with cherry. They\u2019re juicier and tastier, with a thinner skin that makes them superior for bursting into pasta sauce or eating raw.It\u2019s not cheating to use cannedEven at peak season, tomatoes in a can may be more convenient if your goal is to cook \u2019em until they break down completely\u2014say, for a sauce or braise. No need to skin or seed! They also have consistency on their side. Once you find a brand you like (the BA Test Kitchen swears by Bianco DiNapoli Whole Peeled Organic Tomatoes), they won\u2019t vary in acidity or sweetness like fresh tomatoes will.After all that, you deserve a salad\u2026Tomato CaesarAn extra-thick Caesar dressing gives this tomato salad its oomph\u2014and keeps it from sogging out at the picnic.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
