So let the pumpkin spice literally seep into your skin with a seasonal face mask, shovel maple ice cream into your mouth, and accept the fact that things are moving forward, whether you like it or not.For more tricks and treats: Trader Joe\u2019s new fall stuff, reviewedWant this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Hardy KiwisRachel Karten picked up some Hardy Kiwis at the farmers\u2019 market and we gathered \u2018round to taste the invasive but cute mini fruit. They were the size of grape tomatoes with taut brown skin. Inside, they looked like kiwis but tasted sweet and sour. Like regular-sized kiwis, they left a tickly feeling on my tongue. According to my Google results for \u201ckiwi makes mouth feel weird\u201d this is an allergic reaction. Another Hardy Kiwi fact: \u201cSome people find they have a strong laxative effect.\u201d (Got that from a brief from Cornell University on \u201cMinor Fruits.\u201d) Kiwi, kiwi, the minor fruit, the more you eat, the more you\u2026Photo by Alex Lau, food styling by Susie Theodorou, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiAbout the potatoesCarla Lalli Music scrolled through her phone next to me, huffing and puffing as she read angry YouTube comments deeming her and Molly\u2019s perfect velvety mashed potatoes...too watery. \u201cThere\u2019s not even water in it!\u201d she exclaimed. In the video, the potatoes look looser than they were IRL, and they\u2019re marvelous, because I\u2019ve tasted them. But YouTube commenters can\u2019t taste through the screen. \u201cUgh, \u2018potato soup\u2019? Everybody shut up!\u201d said Carla, shaking her head. \u201cTelling me how you do it in Ireland is besides the point!\u201d Exasperation. \u201cEveryone is wrong!\u201d More scrolling. Until she lifts her head up and tells me: \u201cThere will be no apology video.\u201d Stay strong, Carla.Watch it: Molly and Carla Make the Perfect Mashed Potatoes & GravyLearn why we\u2019re using German Butterballs this year and spiking the gravy with MSG.Photo by Michael Graydon and Nikole Herriott, Food Styling by Alison Roman, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiSome things are fancyAlison Roman\u2019s new cookbook, Nothing Fancy, came out this week and we have a whole menu for the chillest possible steak night party you could possibly host. The rib roast is rubbed with an anchovy-garlic-rosemary mixture\u2014!!!! The creamed greens are spiked with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche! Martinis are big-batched!

The answer, to me, is AS MANY AS YOU WANT. Within the constraints of your blood sugar level, that is. Within the office we call this your \u201cdiva coffee order\u201d (DCO). Despite being called \u201cdiva\u201d I want you to know this is a gender neutral designation. It\u2019s like your astrological sign, but with complicated coffee shop orders that make you feel like Marie Antoinette. A large dirty iced almond chai, for example, is one unnamed BA staffer\u2019s. I\u2019m a PSL with an extra shot of espresso, no whipped cream. Who are you?Overheard in the BA officeA long and sustained whisper: \u201cWegmanssssssssss.\u201dHaha\u201cRegular wines require you to memorize pretentious, insider-y terms, like \u2018terroir\u2019 and \u2018mouthfeel,\u2019 and pretend that you can taste leather, granite, and even barnyard in the drink. Natural wines require you to do the exact same thing, but on Instagram, so it\u2019s O.K.\u201dFrom The New Yorker: What You Need to Know About Natural WinePhoto by Chelsie Craig, food styling by Alison AttenboroughHappy DiwaliPriya Krishna is making Shahi toast, a.k.a. no-bake cardamom bread pudding, for Diwali before she flies from Dallas to New York to be the special guest at a standup show at Union Hall on Sunday with comedians including Aparna Nancherla and Hari Kondabolu, some of who will be bringing Indian dishes. \u201cI hope I don\u2019t accidentally insult anyone\u2019s grandmother\u2019s chole recipe!\u201d she said.

Every time we tested it I kept chanting: \u201cPrunes! Prunes! Prunes!\u201d And yet the recipe calls for \u201cdried fruit, such as prunes\u2026.\u201d Which is fine. But you should use prunes. \u201cI want people to use prunes,\u201d said Sohla. They get plump and juicy in the oven, it\u2019s heaven. Why so divisive?\u201cThey\u2019re the worst of all dried fruit!\u201d exclaimed tart cherry champion Aliza Abarbanel. \u201cDisgussssstingggggggg,\u201d Ryan Walker hissed. \u201cThey\u2019re concentrated sugar,\u201d said Andy Baraghani. \u201cI don\u2019t like anything dark and shrively,\u201d groaned Emma Wartzman. \u201cIt\u2019s a big raisin, right?\u201d said a confused Christa Guerra. \u201cImagine all of the other fruits you can eat instead of a prune,\u201d said Alex Delany while opening a can of dolmas at 10:57 a.m. \u201cI don\u2019t like anything that reminds me I\u2019m aging,\u201d said existential Walter Green.The pro-pruners were ready to fight. Just look at Chris Morrocco: \u201cI fucking LOOOOOOVE a prune,\u201d he said so passionately he threw a ball of wax paper and croissant crumbs across his cooking station. \u201cSuper soft jammy fruits, sun-kissed whatever-they-are,\u201d he continued, \u201cI celebrate the plums in all of their splendor; I celebrate prunes, as a logical extension of the glory of plums.\u201d Wow.Rapo likes them in Pork Marbella.Chris Cristiano likes them stuffed with mascarpone at Frankie\u2019s in Brooklyn.Amanda Shapiro likes them \u201cwhen you need them.\u201dHilary Cadigan likes them \u201cin a bag with other dried fruits.\u201dYou\u2019ll like them in Chicken Thigh Biryani.Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecookingNot My Amu\u2019s Chicken Thigh BiryaniBy Sohla El-WayllycultureTrader Joe\u2019s Oat Milk, and More New Winter Stuff, ReviewedBy Alex BeggscultureI Was a Competitive Barista, But I Love a Pumpkin Spice LatteBy Nicole RuckercookingSteak and Potatoes Night in AmericaBy Adam RapoportRecipes you want to make.
