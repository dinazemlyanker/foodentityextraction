The nutmeg, vanilla, citrus juice and zest, and a splash of optional (but highly recommended) toffee-like brandy all enhance that quintessential peach flavor without overpowering it. Look for ripe but firm freestone (not clingstone) peaches, whose pits easily separate from the flesh, and take care not to expel too much juice in the pitting process or else you\u2019ll end up with a too-runny filling. There are many ways to peel a peach, but our favorite method is to lightly score an X on the peach bottoms then blanch them whole in a large pot of boiling water for 30 seconds before transferring to an ice bath; the skins should slip right off. A glass deep-dish pie plate takes the guesswork out of monitoring the bottom crust so you can avoid the dreaded soggy bottom. Finally, let the pie fully cool for the neatest slices (we know, we know\u2014it\u2019s hard!). This recipe was adapted from Lomas\u2019s equally fantastic peach cobbler recipe, which you can find in her debut cookbook, Life Is What You Bake It, available for preorder now.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Add butter and pulse until most of the butter is pea-size with some larger pieces throughout. Drizzle vinegar and \u2153 cup ice water over and pulse, scraping down sides once, just until dough comes together in clumps and there are no large pockets of flour. (Alternatively, whisk flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl and use a pastry cutter to work in butter, then mix in vinegar and water with a rubber spatula.)Step 2Transfer dough clumps to a clean work surface. Using a bench scraper, bring dough together (it will still look quite sandy and you might be tempted to add more water\u2014don\u2019t!) and gently pat into a 1\"-thick rectangle. Using bench scraper, fold dough in half, then gently pat down again into a 1\"-thick rectangle. Fold and pat down dough 2 more times (it should be fairly smooth at this point). Divide dough in half, flatten into disks, and wrap each tightly in plastic. Chill at least 2 hours and up to 3 days.Filling and AssemblyStep 3Let 1 disk of dough sit at room temperature 5 minutes to slightly soften. Roll dough on a floured surface to a 12\"-diameter round. Transfer dough to pie dish; lift up edges and allow dough to slump down into dish. Trim, leaving about 1\" overhang. Chill while you prepare the filling.Step 4Gently toss peaches, cornstarch, lemon juice, brandy (if using), vanilla extract, orange zest, salt, nutmeg, \u2154 cup (133 g) sugar, and 1 Tbsp. flour in a large bowl to coat; set filling aside.Step 5Roll second disk of dough on a floured surface to a 12\"-diameter round. Scrape reserved filling, including juices, into pie crust; dot filling with butter. Top with remaining dough round then press crust edges together and fold over to seal; crimp edges.Step 6Place pie on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and chill in freezer 20 minutes (this helps the crust to become extra flaky).Step 7Meanwhile, place a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 400\u00b0.Step 8Beat egg with 1 Tbsp. water in a small bowl. Mix cinnamon and remaining 2 Tbsp. sugar in another small bowl. Brush pie crust with egg wash, then sprinkle with cinnamon sugar. Cut slits in top of crust to make a large X.Step 9Bake pie on baking sheet 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0 and continue to bake pie, tenting with foil halfway through if crust is browning too quickly, until juices are thickened and bubbling in the center and crust is deep golden brown (check bottom if you can), about 1\u00bd hours. Transfer pie to a wire rack and let cool at least 3 hours before serving.Step 10Serve slices of pie with scoops of vanilla ice cream if desired.Do ahead: Pie can be baked 3 days ahead. Cover tightly and chill.How would you rate Peach Pie?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (4)Back to TopTriangleThe taste was very good but it was very watery.  Not sure what I did wrong but I don't think I'll use this recipe again.  AnonymousColorado9/5/2021I love fruit pies and peaches with brandy made this pie extra special. I have also used ground walnuts as a bottom layer to help absorb the juices from the fruit.SueLas Vegas9/3/2021AssembkyAnonymous8/26/2021The crust is over baked.
