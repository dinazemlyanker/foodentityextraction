This version, which is adapted from my cookbook, Let\u2019s Eat, approximates the traditional curry base, but features broiled chicken so that you don\u2019t have to grill when it\u2019s raining or freezing or you just don\u2019t want to. Any cut of chicken can be used: I like boneless thighs here for the sake of ease and flavor, but any mix of breasts, tenders, or drumsticks can be used, provided they\u2019ve been cut into similar sizes. Because the chicken is cooked separately from the curry base, you also can substitute it with any hearty vegetable to make this dish suitable for a vegetarian diet. For a plant-based diet, skip the addition of heavy cream or substitute it with a creamy barista-style nondairy milk or additional coconut milk. Jalape\u00f1os will work in place of the Thai chiles, though you\u2019ll want to adjust the amount depending on your spice tolerance\u2014my rule of thumb is one medium jalape\u00f1o for every two Thai chiles. And a pinch of cayenne pepper will work in place of the Kashmiri chile powder. \u2014Zaynab IssaAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Kashmiri chile powder. Add 2\u20133 lb. skinless, boneless chicken thighs (about 8 large) and toss to evenly coat. Cover bowl and let sit at room temperature 30 minutes.Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 2Meanwhile, make the curry base. Coarsely chop 1 medium onion, 1 plum tomato, 1\u20132 green Thai chiles (depending on how spicy your chiles are and your heat tolerance), and \u00bc cup cilantro leaves with tender stems. Transfer to a blender or food processor and blend or process until smooth.Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 3Heat broiler. Heat 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a high-sided skillet or large pot over medium. Add \u00bc tsp. ground coriander, \u00bc tsp. ground cumin, and \u215b tsp. ground turmeric. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in pur\u00e9e and add 1\u00bd tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00be tsp. Morton kosher salt. Stir to combine and cook, stirring occasionally, until raw onion smell subsides and curry is paste-like in consistency, 15\u201320 minutes.Step 4Arrange chicken on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and broil until cooked through, charred in spots, and a thermometer inserted into the thickest parts registers 165\u00b0, 17\u201320 minutes.Step 5While the chicken is cooking, shake one 13.5-oz. can unsweetened coconut milk to ensure coconut cream is incorporated, then add coconut milk to curry and stir well to combine. Curry should be pale yellow. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook until warm and slightly thickened, 5\u201310 minutes.Step 6Once chicken is finished, add chicken and any juices accumulated on baking sheet to curry and reduce heat to low; mix well to combine. Stirring constantly to prevent curry from breaking, dribble in \u00bc cup heavy cream. Taste and season with more salt if needed.Step 7Cut remaining 1 lemon into wedges. Serve kuku paka with basmati rice and/or some crusty bread and lemon wedges for squeezing over. Top with additional cilantro to taste.Adapted from LET'S EAT by Zaynab Issa.

They cook just enough in the same amount of time and give some different flavors and textures to the dish. Anonymous11/14/2021Delicious! The spicing is  perfect for me.I can\u2019t tolerate too much chili. Made some flatbreads to go with it. This recipe is also very easy and quick to make. What\u2019s not to like.AlanaKillarney, Ireland 10/15/2021This was delicious! I made 3 adjustments that I thought I'd share: 1) I have the cilantro-problem gene but my husband loves the stuff. I met him halfway and put in half what was called for. It worked - gave it the same freshness that he loves without the soap for me. 2) My local store didn't have Thai chiles and I didn't have time to go anywhere else. I grabbed a couple jalape\u00f1os from my garden and went that route. I could imagine that a little more heat would have been welcome, but my heat-averse kiddos were happy with the way things were. 3) I thought I had 2 cans of coconut milk (I was doubling), but found I didn't mid-recipe. I used one and filled in with heavy cream. I thought it was lovely. Heavy coconut isn't always my favorite anyway and so I might do that again (because there WILL be an again!). \n\nFinally, to those who want to put in more spices, I think you're missing the loveliness of the light spice. It's more comfort dish and less in-your-face flavor. My husband said the same thing. He wanted to call it a \"weak\" flavor, but said that it felt like it was meant to be and that it was delicious.SarahCleveland, OH9/25/2021This is really tasty. I made it following the directions and it tastes great. I do understand why people are mentioning adding mores spices. I think it would benefit from more heat (if you like heat) and some more spice, but honestly it was *great* as is. I was concerned after cooking the curry mix that I did something wrong, but once all the liquid evaporated and it became a paste, it ended up great! I will definitely be eating this again. Next time I'll add a bit more heat, just as it's my preference.RachelPittsburgh9/18/2021So delicious and so simple! Took a little over an hour from start to finish. I let the chicken marinade for about 40ish minutes. I used two Thai green chili\u2019s but probably could have handled another one. Seriously so good, thank you!!BellaDenver CO9/12/2021Very tasty, extremely easy and quick to prepare and cook. Thanks.AlanaKillarney, Kerry, Ireland 8/21/2021This is delicious. I was tempted to add more spices based on instinct and some of the comments, but I\u2019m glad I made it as written. It has a lovely balance. Perhaps next time I might add a bit more heat, but I really enjoyed it as it is. AnonymousNew Hampshire 6/15/2021How to make it without chicken? NinaSan Francisco6/12/2021Perfect as written. Easy and delicious. I will make this again and often! Thank  you.erileeCalifornia5/18/2021I made this based on the already posted rave reviews. I followed the suggestion to use more spices to up the flavor (and added a few of my own). My husband, nicknamed Mr. Fussy, is not a big chicken fan but loved this! So pleased!!!!MarleneBSan Diego, CA5/12/2021Fantastic curry recipe!!! This is going into my regular repertoire of dinner meals.  I recommend adding in a little mango and/or mint chutney to go with it. MeganChicago, Il5/12/2021OMG. I grew up with that on my mums table at least once a week. If not KuKu Paka it was Machie (fish) Paka.  Thank you for posting this. My mother now 85 will love to see this and Im sure to ask her to make it for me again. DattuToronto, Canada 5/11/2021Much, much better than I expected. Also extremely easy. Will be making again! Will PlattMadison, CT5/6/2021Tasted great for a dinner party I hosted. Mistakenly bought a Serano pepper which made it a little spicy, so I ended up doubling the recipe. Also added a teaspoon of curry.
