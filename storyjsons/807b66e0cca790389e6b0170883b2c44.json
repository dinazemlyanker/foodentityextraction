We've roasted it, we've \"loaded\" it, we've turned it into \"hummus\" (twice!). Some intrepid individuals have even disguised it as toast (the jury's out\u2014I'm not convinced). That's all well and good, but I'd like to talk a little about the better sweet potato: the Japanese sweet potato.And if it's unnecessarily cruel and petty to rank one sweet potato over another\u2014I have room in my heart, stomach, and kitchen for all kinds!\u2014I'll just put it this way: I pick up four or five palm-sized Japanese sweet potatoes during my weekly grocery-shop. The Garnets and the Jewels appear only in the most particular of cases.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.When I talk about Japanese sweet potatoes, I'm referring specifically to the Murasaki variety (available at Trader Joe's!), which have a deep magenta skin and white flesh that turns Champagne gold as it cooks. They're simultaneously drier and creamier than orange-fleshed sweet potatoes, which means that when you roast them at high heat (cubes, wedges, circles, or halves, simply coated with olive oil and salt and cooked between 425 and 450\u00b0), their edges get unbelievably crispy and burnished, belying the pudding-like centers. I find that orange sweet potatoes tend to sog out\u2014at their best, they're fluffy and fall-apart tender, offering a mild, squishy relief in an assertive dish; at their worst, they're strangely wet and watery. Japanese sweet potatoes, on the other hand, are reliable in their ability to brown and char: If you're going to make sweet potato oven fries, look no further.But I also love to go solely soft and steam them in the Instant Pot, which takes about 8 minutes on high pressure. They're so naturally sweet\u2014more of an earthy, chestnut-y sweetness rather than a sugary one\u2014that the only adornment you need is a sprinkle of flaky salt, though I'm always even happier with a generous sprinkling of gomasio. Whereas steamed orange potatoes can be mushy, airy, or even stringy (I'm sorry but it's true!), steamed Japanese sweet potatoes are dense, luscious, and spoonable\u2014the texture of a really cold cheesecake. My Strange Snack\u2122 consists of a steamed sweet potato split down the center and spread with peanut butter (this brand and only this brand) and fig jam. I'll wrap it in parchment paper and break it out on the subway (sorry, Alex Delany) or when I only have a few minutes to scarf something down during a long day.I'll still use the orange sweet potatoes (not yams) if I'm making something mashed and potentially covered in marshmallows (or, preferably, spread onto bread), but when I want a portable snack, a crispy wedge, or a charred half, it's Muraski I turn to.Once you know Japanese sweet potatoes, it might be hard to return to the orange side. Don't say I didn't warn you.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSweet PotatoRead MorecookingI\u2019m Never Not Making This Sweet Potato Dish AgainBy Carla Lalli MusicRecipes you want to make.
