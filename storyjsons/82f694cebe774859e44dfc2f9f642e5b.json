A Little Thing Called \u201cPork Mayo\u201dAt Portland, Oregon\u2019s Magna Kusina, chef Carlos Lamagna will show you the light.By Hilary CadiganFebruary 24, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Dina AvilaFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.Ask chef Carlo Lamagna what\u2019s in the sisig at Magna Kusina, his homey new Filipino restaurant in Portland, Oregon, and he\u2019ll point to the rather cryptic menu description: \u201cpork bits, egg, chile.\u201dPush him further and he\u2019ll tell you that it\u2019s Filipino headcheese: all the edible parts of a pig\u2014roasted, simmered, and hand-chopped. \u201cWhen I was living in the Philippines, I used to go hang out at bars and clubs at a young age\u2014don't ask\u2014and this was a very common dish served alongside a cold beer,\u201d he says. \u201cSome cultures have bar snacks. Filipinos tend to take it to the next level.\u201d Once he became a cook, he consulted with some friends from Pampanga, where sisig originates, to come up with the perfect recipe.\u201cBut which parts of the pig, exactly?\u201d you\u2019ll persist.He\u2019ll wait, watching you pierce the golden egg yolk so it flows over that crispy-fatty meat melange and melts like hot butter on your tongue. Only then, as you\u2019re leaning back against your chair with silent satisfaction, will he divulge: The secret is what he calls pork mayo, a.k.a. poached pig brain. Chile-laced, soy-salted, and supernaturally creamy, it transforms an already rich dish into something otherworldly. But by this time you\u2019re too busy mopping it up with sticky rice to ask any more questions.Go there: Magna KusinaRead MorerestaurantsI\u2019ll Always Save Room For This Flaky Malaysian RotiBy Emily SchultzRecipes you want to make.
