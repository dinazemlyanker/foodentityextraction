Now comes...everything else.By Meryl RothsteinMarch 26, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Ted + Chelsea CavanaughFacebookTwitterEmailI knew I had a plastics problem. We all do, right? You\u2019ve heard the statistics: one million plastic bottles sold every minute. Eighteen billion pounds of plastic tossed in the ocean each year. But if you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ve shuddered at the stats, then ordered in lo mein and thought, At least I use a tote. This time I wondered, What does my plastics problem actually look like? So for a week I kept every piece of disposable plastic I used while eating or cooking. In a giant, um, plastic bag, I put every take-out container, every clamshell leftover from cherry tomatoes, every one of those produce bags I drop my wet escarole into at the market. It was not a small pile.Good thing I recycle dutifully, I told myself. But then I learned that much of what we think is getting recycled isn\u2019t because of contaminants like food residue and labels. Turns out only 9 percent of all plastic has ever been recycled, and none of it\u2014none of it\u2014has ever biodegraded.Was this experiment depressing? Yes. But it was encouraging too. I used so much plastic without realizing it, which means that if I actually thought about it, I knew I could do better.So from Friday, March 29th through Sunday the 31st, I am going to do better, joining much of the Bon App\u00e9tit staff and, we hope, many of you, to spend a weekend without using any new plastic. That means packing our own lunches, bringing thermoses to the coffee shop, passing on yogurt and baby arugula and all those other things the supermarket only seems to sell in plastic.It\u2019s an exercise, not a solution. Every harissa-loving, BA-reading home cook in the world could forgo plastic for three days and it wouldn\u2019t exactly clean up the oceans. But it\u2019s a good place to start.Maybe it\u2019ll help you identify your pain points, or make you aware of the plastic you can easily do without (do you really need that straw? or that plastic lid for your coffee cup?), or spark ideas for solutions you can implement going forward. Maybe it\u2019ll inspire you to take on Big Cherry Tomato (or more likely, grocers and food companies) and tell them you care how products are packaged. Maybe it\u2019ll implant in your brain a plastic radar that dings every time you encounter single-use plastic in your daily life, like the one I can\u2019t seem to turn off these days.So find your best tote, grab your Swell bottle, and get on your soapbox (in a not-too-annoying way), because together, we\u2019re going to break our plastic habit.Read Moreculture14 Ways to Break Your Plastic HabitGallery14 SlidesBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
