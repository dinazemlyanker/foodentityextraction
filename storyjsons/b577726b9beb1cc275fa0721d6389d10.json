How does she get that way? Bulletproof coffee. A little after 5 a.m., the Live with Kelly and Ryan co-host combines the \u201cdarkest roast coffee\u201d she and her husband, actor Mark Consuelos, can find with a spoonful of Organic Valley ghee and two shots of espresso, and blitzes it in a blender until frothy. \u201cIt fills me up and I feel satiated, so it keeps me from being ravenous during the show,\u201d she explains, since she doesn\u2019t eat anything before the cameras roll.Yep, it's ghee-spiked coffee powering Ripa through Live with Kelly and Ryan\nPhoto by Alex LauThroughout the 18 years that she has co-hosted Live\u2014first with Regis Philbin, then Michael Strahan, and now Ryan Seacrest\u2014she has learned that eating and being on camera don\u2019t mix well. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very hard to host a morning show when you\u2019re digesting\u2014my brain almost goes to sleep,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve tried eating once or twice before the show and it\u2019s always been a disaster.\u201dThat said, she does not limit herself when it comes to eating\u2014it just all happens after the show wraps filming for the day. Below, Ripa shares a glimpse into her morning routine (featuring...Madonna?), how she\u2019s handling \u201cpost-traumatic election disorder,\u201d the healthyish snacks she eats like candy, and why at 48 she\u2019s eating \u201cwhatever the hell I want.\u201dWhat\u2019s your favorite part of your morning routine?I really love Madonna\u2019s MDNA products\u2014bet you didn\u2019t know she has a full skincare and makeup line! I got the line as a birthday gift and think it\u2019s incredible. I like to put on her rose mist before I put on any moisturizer, and she has an under-eye oil that I think is very moisturizing, and I see a difference with the texture of my skin.Do you use any wellness products?I love a jade roller. I\u2019m not sure if it does anything, but I actually love the way it feels on my face, and I keep it in the refrigerator so that it\u2019s nice and cold. It probably doesn\u2019t do anything, but it feels good. It\u2019s just a nice cooling little way to wake up.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Do you usually work out with your husband? I\u2019ve seen you doing yoga together on Instagram.Mark and I don\u2019t actually work out together ever unless we are on vacation. There\u2019s this incredible woman in the Bahamas named Tamara Fredericks-Lorey, @yogatambahamas on Instagram, and we worked with her on our 22-year anniversary trip to Harbor Island last year. That was a nice escape. I think that I\u2019ve just been too into the election and the news cycle, and I feel like I have post-traumatic election disorder. I just felt like I\u2019ve been paying too close attention to the news, and I need to disconnect from it for a little bit. I think we all probably do.How do you unwind after an exhausting day?Lately, the kids and I have been watching old episodes of Hoarders on Netflix. I used to watch Hoarders when it was on A&E, and I found it fascinating. After my two youngest kids finish their homework, they climb into bed with me and we watch a few episodes before bed. And then I dream about cleaning things out of my closet because I am truly also very affected by that show.Are there any wellness trends you don\u2019t believe in?I\u2019ve been given more sage to burn than most people. People really believe in the power of sage. I\u2019m not really a sage burner. I try not to let toxicity in my life, so the need to cleanse it is very minimal. That goes for any level, whether it\u2019s people or a work situation, or friendships that are bad for you. I just don\u2019t allow that in my space, and therefore I just have bunches of unburned sage everywhere.What about fad diets?My husband has gone full keto, which I don\u2019t mind telling you is something I could never do. I just don\u2019t have that level of discipline. Mark says that I\u2019m carb-o, because I always eat his bun if he gets a burger. And the fries. But you know, I work out, so I feel like I\u2019m allowed. I\u2019m 48, I\u2019m entitled, and I\u2019m eating whatever I want to eat.What do you snack on in your dressing room?I do enjoy keeping nuts around me at all times, and I don\u2019t just mean the people in my life. [Laughs] I mean almonds and cashews, and I do like dried fruit. I know people will say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s the jellybean of the healthy snack world,\u201d but for me, dried apricots and cherries are better than candy. I know it has as much sugar, but I just enjoy it. And peanut butter ThinkThin high protein bars, which many nutritionists have told me \u201care not the best ones,\u201d but I like how they taste.You stay mostly healthy\u2014what\u2019s your \u201cish\u201d?Mark and I used to have peanut butter and jelly as a bedtime snack. I\u2019m not sure why. Even as a kid, I didn\u2019t really like it, but now here I am. I get ciabatta bread, and now I eat half a sandwich before bed, with chunky Skippy peanut butter or Justin\u2019s honey peanut butter and Bonne Maman strawberry or raspberry jam. Here\u2019s the thing: I\u2019m 48. These are things at 38 I never would have tainted myself with. But at 48, I\u2019m sort of saying, Who cares? Life is short. Eat the peanut butter and jelly.Explore Bon App\u00e9titInterviewsCelebritiesKelly RipaHealthyishGheeCoffeeRead MorecookingWhat Is Ghee, the Clarified Butter We Could Eat by the Spoon?By Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
