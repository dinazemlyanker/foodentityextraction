He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Your holiday party checklistShould we dim the lights a smidge more? And what about ice\u2014do we have enough ice? No, of course not, we can never have too much ice. And wait, who chose this playlist?When it comes to throwing a party, my wife, Simone, and I can be a bit\u2026particular. Especially during the holidays, when expectations climb and everyone\u2019s calendar jams up with competing engagements.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!But there is nothing I enjoy more than a good holiday party: the glistening ham (yes, there must be a ham), the punch bowl (the primary cause of your next-morning hangover), the twinkling tree (says the nice Jewish boy), and Nat King Cole or Frank Sinatra on the speakers (you really can\u2019t go wrong with either).It all starts with the guest list. Which, invariably, leads to the discussion between Simone and me of how big of a get-together we want to host. I\u2019ve always been of the school to invite everyone we know because half of them won\u2019t be able to make it, and it\u2019s always better to have too many guests than too few. This, Simone likes to point out, has led to our essentially throwing college-level keggers, wherein by night\u2019s end we realize we might have had fun, but we never found a single moment to hold a proper conversation with a friend.So, what is the formula for a memorable holiday party? Well, to start, how about a slightly smaller affair? More soiree than rager. And yes, ham. Bone-in, scored, and glazed. One of the easiest and most impressive things you will ever make. Set it on a grand cutting board with a basket of those squishy square-cut dinner rolls, some Dijon and mayo, and a crock of cornichons. Your friends will talk about this spread until December 2019.Punch. Looks nice, particularly with a big molded block of ice bobbing in the middle of the bowl. But you know what? I could do without it. It goes quick, it\u2019s too sweet, and if you have a kid waking you up at 6:45 the next morning, you\u2019ll be glad you didn\u2019t indulge.Bobbi LinDimmers. Votives. Christmas lights. You know the drill. Good lighting is everything. Remember how your mom always told you to dress up for special occasions? Well, she was right. Put a look together\u2014your party deserves it.Finally, don\u2019t forget to have fun. It sounds obvious, but throwing a party is a lot of work. Inevitably, an hour before your guests arrive, you or your partner will be nearing full meltdown mode. One of you will have to run to the store for the 46th time that day. That outfit you thought was going to work is totally not going to work. And at the exact same second, you will both realize you have yet to jump in the shower.But if all does go as planned, there will be that moment at the end of the night when the votives are flickering and you and your close friends are splayed out on the sofa and the living room floor. Someone will be trying to carve the last bit of meat from the ham bone. Someone else will open a totally unnecessary final bottle of wine. And you will realize why you threw this party in the first place.Get the recipes:Pineapple-Glazed HamSpicy-Tamarind-and-Honey-Glazed Spiral HamSpiced Rum Punch with Citrus and LuxardoEarl Grey\u2013Bourbon PunchYou know what would make a pretty great holiday gift?
