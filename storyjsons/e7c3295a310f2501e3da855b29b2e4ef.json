I don\u2019t sous vide, so I\u2019d never had much use for vacuum sealing\u2014but what a world I was missing! A world without oxygen.The Zwilling Fresh & Save vacuum pump is a handheld, cordless, rechargeable mini-vac about the size of a pepper grinder. By vacuum sealing your leftovers, from lasagna to parsley to spelt flour, you can extend their shelf life by days to weeks to months. (You could also use them to store dry pantry goods, like in the photo above.) Zwilling says food lasts, on average, five times longer when it\u2019s vac sealed, and because ~30 percent of the food we bring home from the store ends up being wasted (oof), it\u2019s nice to think that we might waste slightly less by using this thing. If you\u2019re only cooking for one, the vacuum sealer is a godsend for leftover ingredients that might otherwise go bad, like avocado halves. (They don\u2019t brown!)Photo Courtesy Zwilling\u00a0How it worksFirst, you need the reusable plastic bags and/or containers\u2014which come in plastic or glass\u2014that Zwilling makes to go along with the vacuum pump. (That part is annoying, because I hate having mismatched containers. But this is a whole system, so Zwilling envisions this being your one and only, I guess.) The containers are dishwasher-safe, but you\u2019re better off hand-washing the bags so you can get into the corners.With the vacuum sealable bags, you can sous vide if you\u2019re into that, or use them to compactly store cookie dough and whatnot in your freezer, as I did, so you have more room for your quart containers of meal-prep martinis.Both the containers and bags have these round plastic belly buttons that you align with the vacuum pump\u2019s circular rubber nozzle. Press a button on the pump and a little motor whirs while it sucks the oxygen out of the container. When there\u2019s no more oxygen left to suck, the vacuum turns off automatically and you press down on the container\u2019s red belly button to seal it tight.The process itself is almost more enticing than the reward of surprisingly fresh parsley. Watching anything get vacuum sealed in a plastic bag, becoming a futuristic play food version of itself, is hypnotizing. The sense of satisfaction that washes over me as my frozen blueberries get squeezed into their plastic Spanx is what incentivizes me to vacuum seal more, more, MORE!Removing the air from the storage containers isn\u2019t as exhilarating, but with the containers you\u2019re able to vacuum seal almost anything, from leftover fish that you know would\u2019ve been neglected and ultimately thrown out to an entire cake. (I sealed a lemon pound cake into its oxygen-less coffin and it stayed moist for over a week.) Zwilling makes a little bento box, too, so you can keep your lunch as fresh as it was when you threw it together in the dark.You can\u2014and should\u2014also get the wine bottle toppers so you can save half-empty bottles of Cab Franc for later in the week. (Do not attempt this on sparkling wine, lest you vacuum up all the bubbles.) When you release the wine topper, it lets out the most thrilling psssssssfffffft, like a frosty bottle of Pepsi. It even sounds fresh!A list of the things I\u2019ve vacuum sealed latelyA wedge of ParmesanSpelt flour I bought too much of to store in the freezer (*be careful\u2014you need to manually stop the sealer before any tiny flour particles start to get sucked into the mechanisms)So much wineA nice rice saladA few jalape\u00f1osFrozen buttermilk biscuit doughFrozen blueberriesFrozen HEB tortillas (thanks, Dad!)An entire pistachio loaf cakeApple slices (boring)A single sprig of mintA ham hockBaconMy feelingsBut here are the things you can\u2019t vacuum seal\u2014consider yourself warned!Don\u2019t seal anything with liquid, which will clog up the machine. NO marinated meats. NO soup. Soft foods, like blueberries, may need to be frozen before sealing so they don\u2019t turn to jam. When I seal softies like doughnuts (have done this multiple times to rave reviews), I manually stop the sealer before it squishes the apple fritter too much, and hours later my preserved doughnut will be able to bounce back, resurrected and ready for dessert.And finally, if you hold the vacuum up to the frown line in between your eyebrows\u2014worth a shot, at least once\u2014know that it won\u2019t suck the wrinkle there out of its deepening crevice. You can\u2019t vacuum seal the inevitable.ZWILLING J.A.
