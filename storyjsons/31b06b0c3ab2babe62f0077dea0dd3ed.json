Up next, a conversation with actor and cooking enthusiast Jason Genao.Jason Genao is the kind of person you\u2019d be happy to slip into random conversation with at a party. Our conversation ebbs and flows, touching on the emotional toll of being an actor and starring on Netflix\u2019s hit show On My Block, the special place his Dominican heritage holds in his heart, and his passion for food.When it comes to the Jersey City native\u2019s love for cooking, part of the magic, he says, is being there and getting to see the satisfaction wash over someone\u2019s face as they enjoy a dish he\u2019s put together with care. It\u2019s a reprieve from the uncertainty of pouring your heart out, releasing it, and never quite knowing how the people consuming it are feeling that accompanies acting. \u201cI think all actors are super insecure, and the insecurity lies there, in not knowing. So when it comes to cooking, it kind of calms your nerves\u2014when a person takes that first bite, you can see their reaction right there. It\u2019s very different.\u201dIf one thing\u2019s for certain after talking with Jason, it\u2019s that he\u2019s just getting started. Like many artists, there\u2019s a heap of skills and interests waiting to be explored that I imagine will be harnessed across a range of mediums in the coming years. He\u2019s growing, living life, and tapping more into his gifts and confidence each day. The sky\u2019s the limit.Below, I caught up with Jason about tender moments centered around family and Dominican food, what self-care looks like when being vulnerable is an essential part of your job, and what it\u2019s been like for the East Coast native to find a Caribbean community in Los Angeles.Hey Jason! How has life in quarantine been treating you?Jason: You know what, I have such a big family so I\u2019ve been doing pretty well during quarantine. I currently live in L.A., but I went back to Jersey. We\u2019re just holding each other down, you know? Playing dominoes and doing what Spanish people do.My mom\u2019s been asking me to play dominoes and I\u2019m like, Uhhhhh\u2026Jason: Do it with her, I\u2019m telling you.(Laughs) It seems so boring\u2026Jason: What? No. Are you crazy?! Our domino games would last for hours and it would turn into these pots of hundreds of dollars where the winner would get the money in the middle.Are you guys sharing stories in between or is everyone just focused on the game?Jason: Oh, my god. They shared so many stories. My father has 14 brothers and sisters and they all grew up in the Dominican Republic. I don\u2019t know much about my dad\u2014we\u2019re not that close because he worked so much. So, I was like tell me about my dad, to my aunts and stuff, and they started telling me the craziest stories. So now I have this idea in my head that I should write a book about the Genao family history.That would be amazing\u2014and then maybe it would be adapted. We need more Dominican stories.Jason: One hundred percent.I was checking out your Instagram which is very low-key. What does a real glimpse into your life look like?Jason: I get so much flack for not being active on Instagram. It\u2019s this crazy thing where people feel like if you don\u2019t post, you\u2019re not doing much. And I\u2019m like, doing everything and anything possible, but because I don\u2019t post, people love to ask me, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go do this and do that?\u201d I\u2019m there, trust me, I\u2019m just like, \u201cNo pictures, please.\u201dHa, I did not doubt you! I did not doubt that you were booked and busy, and living life. Let\u2019s talk food! Before your focus was on acting, you were on the path to pursuing cooking as a career. Why was that a fit for you?Jason: Cooking was something that was tangible. When I lived in an apartment building, I lived in 1L and my aunt lived in 1R. She was this amazing cook. Every day I\u2019d go over and she\u2019d tell me to help her, even if it was just like peeling a cucumber or something like that. I became so infatuated with cooking.What was one of your favorite things to eat together?Jason: Locrio de longaniza. My mom, god bless her, isn\u2019t the best cook\u2014Mmm, I saw that interview where you threw her under the bus...Jason: I didn\u2019t throw her under the bus. She knows I\u2019m not the biggest fan, and I prewarned her that it might come up one day. She also didn\u2019t cook that many things. In my whole 20 years living at home, there\u2019s like five things she cooked: rice and beans, or rice mixed with beans, and then either chicken, pork, or steak all seasoned the same way. That\u2019s what I was used to, then my aunt made this thing called locrio de longaniza, which is rice with Dominican sausage in it. It was the craziest moment. I remember tasting it and being like, Can I have more? And then when her husband came home and he ate, and there was still food left over, I asked, \u201cT\u00eda, can I have more now that everybody ate?\u201d It was the craziest thing I ever tasted. I was really young and it was the first thing that was so different. After that I was like, let\u2019s do this.Do you mostly make a certain type of food?Jason: I started out with Dominican food because that\u2019s all the ingredients we had in the house. But I remember I saw the movie Julie & Julia, with Meryl Streep and Amy Adams, and I became obsessed. My brother bought me the whole collection of Mastering the Art of French Cooking and I got really into French cooking. I was around 12 years old, so I\u2019d call my dad, like, \u201cCould you bring this or could you bring that?\u201d Or I\u2019d tell my brother that I\u2019d cook if he could just take me to the grocery store. I was experiencing new herbs that weren\u2019t typically Hispanic\u2014such as sage and basil\u2014and ingredients that I\u2019d only ever heard of, like curry powder and gochujang. And then I started going to a fancy market and would buy things like foie gras and truffle oil, and make truffle mac \u2019n\u2019 cheese and pan-seared foie gras. And now I\u2019ve sort of fallen into this realm where I mix French and Dominican cuisines.That kind of reminds me of Kelis and how she\u2019s explored different areas of her interests with singing and going to culinary school, and starting a sauce line. Maybe exploring food will be one of your next chapters down the road\u2026Jason: I have 100 chapters to go through. Right now I\u2019m in the process of writing, so my next chapter is writing. But I mean I\u2019m never not cooking, whether it\u2019s at the house or through other things. I\u2019ve been looking into food trucks just because I want to venture out small and see what happens, and eventually maybe have a restaurant. If I could, I would be like one of those ladies who cooks from their house and then brings a little cart with premade plates to the barber shop. That\u2019s how much I love cooking.How do you deal with coming from the East Coast, where there\u2019s such a big Caribbean community and Dominican presence, to Los Angeles, where it\u2019s sort of the polar opposite?Jason: Oh, my god, it\u2019s crazy. I remember when I came here, I couldn\u2019t even find adobo. [The supermarket chain] Ralphs didn\u2019t have it; all these places didn\u2019t have it. I had to go to this Hispanic place that my friend put me onto called Vallarta. That\u2019s where I found it, and I remember I bought like five, and mojos. I was like let me get this shit, L.A. does not know at all. My first year in L.A., I became so homesick that I went through this whole journey one day of trying to find Dominican food on UberEats and it just wasn\u2019t happening for me. I\u2019ve learned to become the Caribbean culture for myself and the people around me. I know that I\u2019m not going to find it too much out here. I have Dominican and Caribbean friends, but when it comes to cooking, I\u2019m like, \u201cCome over and I\u2019ll cook.\u201d And we\u2019ll have really Hispanic food for the day because we just had a bunch of sushi and stuff the day before. Like, let\u2019s Dominican this night up.Those are some of the best times. Just being in a comfortable space you create with your loved ones\u2014enjoying good food and good company.Jason: Exactly.Let\u2019s talk acting. I love On My Block. Acting as a profession seems so vulnerable, from the auditioning process to oftentimes portraying heavy emotions in front of, and alongside, strangers. What does self-care look like for you when putting yourself out there emotionally is such a regular part of your job?Jason: For me, it\u2019s really important to learn how to balance out the negative thoughts. That\u2019s been my biggest issue and has taken the most self-care work. It is vulnerable being out there every day, going through a million nos just for the one yes. Whether it\u2019s through therapy or learning how to do it on your own, I think it\u2019s important to maintain this sense of clarity that you\u2019re here for certain purposes or you want certain things, and that there\u2019s processes to get through all of it.It\u2019s sort of impossible to not sulk in the negativity of life. What I try to do is give myself a limited sulking period. You take everything that you did wrong and you learn from it. I write it down in my notes sometimes, so I can revisit it and see what I can do better. But after two or three days, or maybe a week, then you have to start thinking of all the positivity in your life. And then you go into that mentality where it\u2019s a new day, there\u2019s a new challenge, you have more opportunities coming, blah blah blah. You speak to yourself on a positive note. I think that\u2019s the important thing, giving a grace period for how long you can sulk and how long you can think negative thoughts.What\u2019s something that\u2019s brought you joy this year? Even if it\u2019s like, I had a really good sandwich the other day.Jason: When I first went back to the East Coast, instead of staying at my parents\u2019 house, I went to Pennsylvania to quarantine with my cousins who I grew up with. We\u2019ve always been super close. Every single day that I was there brought so much joy, whether it was doing nothing, or playing dominoes and then bingo, or cooking. Other than that, I really find joy in every day now, even the little things. That\u2019s also now a part of self-care, finding the joy in everything. Or just creating joy. Whenever it feels like you\u2019re not having any joy, you can go out and take a walk or go get some good food or hit up some people. Or work or write. I started this thing where I read two books a month, and I just read Selenis Leyva\u2019s memoir with her sister Marizol Leyva, My Sister: How One Sibling\u2019s Transition Changed Us Both, that\u2019s also brought me joy. I\u2019m tryna find joy in every day now.Explore Bon App\u00e9titLos AngelesHealthyishHere We AreInterviewsRead MorecultureHealthy Hyna Founder Lorena Ramirez On Going Vegan and Visualizing the FutureBy Martine ThompsonRecipes you want to make.
