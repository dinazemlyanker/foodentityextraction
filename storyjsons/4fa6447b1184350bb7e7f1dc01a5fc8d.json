Hourly.By Alex BeggsNovember 26, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Emily SchultzFacebookTwitterEmailOne day, food director Carla Lalli Music walked over to my desk and said, \u201cWHY HASN\u2019T ANYONE WRITTEN ABOUT BRAD\u2019S DUSTBUSTER ADDICTION?\u201dSo here we are.In the Bon App\u00e9tit test kitchen\u2014a place where Claire makes gourmet Gushers and where dreams come true\u2014cooking also happens, and so do messes. Which is why test kitchen manager Brad Leone keeps a dustbuster always charged and at the ready. Maybe too ready.\u201cCoffee beans, flour, he\u2019s down there with that Dyson,\u201d Carla told me. Brad clarified: \u201cWhoever said Dyson? It\u2019s Black and Decker.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Brad\u2019s thing,\u201d added Carla, \u201cIt\u2019s hilarious when he goes crazy [vacuuming everything]. When you say, Brad, dustbuster this up? [Carla imitates Brad vacuuming like it\u2019s the Last Crusade.] He likes to get in the shelves, too.\u201dBrad\u2019s one true love.\nPhoto by Emily SchultzIn the test kitchen while he was making some breakfast tacos, Brad told me about all the ways he uses his trusty dustbuster. \u201cYou\u2019re chopping onions,\u201d he said, picking up some onions from a bin to show me specifically the vegetable of which he speaks, \u201cand suddenly that stuff\u2019s all over the floor,\u201d\u2014he points to some onion skins on the floor\u2014 \u201cit always happens. Or you\u2019re dicing carrots and you get a couple carrots there, and real quick boop-boop-boop, it\u2019s so easy. The filter is washable, a crucial detail. At home, he has a slightly smaller, cheaper model that can hang on the wall so as not to use up counter space.Other things that need dustbusting in the kitchen, according to Brad:\u201cA little spice mixture on the floor.\u201d\u201cSome ground beef. Wait, not like raw meat.\u201d\u201cPeople are always dropping herbs.\u201d\u201cYou get the flour bag out, and boom-boom, there\u2019s always some flour that falls on the ground.\u201d\u201cIn the fridge crisper drawer, maybe there\u2019s a green bean dehydrated back there.\u201d\u201cAs long as it\u2019s not greasy, in the oven.\u201d\u201cToaster oven, lift up the little thing and zzing-zzing-zzing.\u201d\u201cAround my coffee grinder, the general coffee station.\u201dSure, a dustpan could also clean these things, but you never get it all, said Brad, \u201cYou need that suction.\u201dYou. Need. That. Suction.\u201cIt really came in handy when Emily Eisen broke a full jar of dried turmeric INSIDE HER PURSE,\u201d recalled Claire \u201cHalf-Sour\u201d Saffitz. \u201cNo one asked why she had it in there in first place. But boy, does Brad love that thing.\u201dAnd it\u2019s a passion he\u2019s passed down to his toddler. \u201cGriff loves it, he walks around like this [imitated baby using dustbuster.] It\u2019s just a really, really, handy tool.\u201dPhoto by Emily SchultzBuy it: Black + Decker 16V Cordless Lithium Hand Vacuum, $42 on Amazon (originally $60)Related: A Riveting Conversation with Brad Leone, the Star of It's AliveWatch Brad make kimchi:All products featured on bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
