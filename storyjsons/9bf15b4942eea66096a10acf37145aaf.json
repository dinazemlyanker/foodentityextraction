Subbed minced spicy fridge pickles for the relish, used spicy brown mustard instead of the 2 mustards suggested, and relied on kohlrabi instead celery for the crunch. Really satisfied the classic potato salad craving I had, and didn't take a lot of time or effort. MadisonHolland, MI9/19/2021Didn't have high hopes for this recipe, not being a big fan of potato salad OR mustard, but was really craving something to take me back to my childhood summers.  So glad BA published this one because it was delicious!  The flavors were completely balanced and like everything wonderful about potato salad I remember as a child, only BETTER.  \n\nSwitching from russets to yukon gold potatoes made this salad so divine and luscious.  Subbed minced cornichon for the relish and it worked for me.  And it's so great to have a little leftover jar of the BBQ seasoning (tastes like BBQ chips) to sprinkle over roast veggies or deviled eggs. Yum! Going in my favorites file for sure.AnonymousLos Angeles, CA7/22/2020I have a sort of aversion to relish, so I left that out.  Potato salads for me are usually really good or really bad and I think this is the best one I have ever had!AnonymousRocky River, Ohio6/25/2020This is the potato salad of my youth and it's fantastic. We will be making this all summer. We didn't have celery and that crunch will be a great addition the next time we make it. AnonymousDenver, CO6/14/2020Two mustards are better than one. This is quintessential potato salad and I want to eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. (I subbed white onions, but red would be better.) Will be making this recipe all summer. alexbeggsBon App\u00e9tit 6/7/2020This was really good! So full of flavour, well seasoned and great crunch from the veggies! I could only wait an hour before eating it, I suspect it will be amazing when I eat it tomorrow. FYI I did half this recipe and there was no issues,I just added a few tablespoons of mayo before serving so it was extra creamy . The only substitution I made was I had no relish and i'm trying to limit grocery store visits so I used pickles diced up and a few tablespoons of sugar, worked well and great crunch from the pickles. sarahroessnerHamilton, Ontario, Canada 6/7/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladPotato SaladAmericanPotatoVegetableYukon Gold PotatoSummerEasySideNut-FreeVegetarianGluten-FreeDairy-FreeSimmerJuneteenthFourth Of JulyMemorial DayLabor DayLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
