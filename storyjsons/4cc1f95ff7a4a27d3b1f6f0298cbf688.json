I look forward to it like it's a holiday, spending months culling recipes and debating what kitchen tools are actually necessary to schelp with me. When we finally pull up to the rented house in Truro, Cape Cod, all six adults (including one very large one that eats for three) know that I\u2019m in charge of the kitchen\u2014including dinner, and cocktails, and post-beach snacks in between. So I pretty much am a private chef for that week\u2014except my fee is a few thrills on my 11-year-old nephew\u2019s boogie board rather than cold hard cash.This is always very exciting at first. Access to a grill! All the fresh fish! Peak produce! And, well, let\u2019s face it: total control! But after a few days on vacation, it gets harder and harder to stay ambitious. When that day comes, I turn to this swordfish steak recipe, a dish that tastes, and looks, way more impressive than the amount of actual effort required to make it.That starts, for me at least, with the fact that swordfish feels fancy AF. It\u2019s got that beautiful pink hue, a muscle pattern of white concentric circles, and comes in one-inch-plus \u201csteaks,\u201d like it\u2019s some sort of rib eye. That can make it sound intimidating, but because it\u2019s sturdy, meaty (see aforementioned \u201csteaks\u201d), and mild in both smell and flavor, it\u2019s also pretty forgiving.Add to this the news that you barely have to touch it, or worry about it, after you\u2019ve slid it under the broiler for a few minutes with some cherry tomatoes, anchovies, and capers, and it\u2019s pretty much a no-hands no-brainer. The accoutrements are all pantry staples, and the sauce feels like a truncated puttanesca\u2014which, if you know anything about me, then you understand that the addictively briny Italian pasta sauce with a highly questionable name is actually the quickest way to my heart.A can of anchovies always comes in handy.\nPhoto by Randy Harris/Courtesy of Abrams PublishingThe recipe calls for canned cherry tomatoes, but when I make it in the summer, I usually use fresh ones, and give the sauce mixture a headstart in the oven. Once the tomato skins start to char, I\u2019ll make some room for the swordfish and carry on as normal. Having made the recipe the \u201cright way\u201d too, I can assure you that it\u2019s deeply satisfying all year round.It\u2019s only April, but I\u2019ve already got my eye on a few new recipes I\u2019m earmarking for our annual migration north. But when push comes to shove and day four of the trip hits, I know I\u2019ll be reaching for this swordfish steak recipe.Get the recipe:Swordfish Steaks with Cherry Tomatoes and CapersSwordfish, with its meaty texture and strong (not in a bad way) flavor, can stand up to other robust seasonings like these.View Recipehttps://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/swordfish-steaks-cherry-tomatoes-capersExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyNever FailSwordfishCapersRecipes you want to make.
