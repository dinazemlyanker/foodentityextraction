She is a phenomenal baker. A runner. An Olympics enthusiast. But to the fans of her Bon App\u00e9tit video series \u201cGourmet Makes,\u201d where senior food editor Claire Saffitz recreates classic junk foods (Twinkies, Gushers, Oreos)\u2014she\u2019s worthy of deep, loyal worship. Honestly we all worshiped Claire already (this deep-dish apple pie is one reason among hundreds), but the YouTube series went viral and we realized we weren\u2019t showing it nearly enough.Here are some recent fan art contributions inspired by Claire and her iconic gray streak, her anguish and triumph in moments of culinary travail, her everlasting friendship with Test Kitchen manager Brad Leone.Illustration by Jordan JohnsonArtist Jordan Johnson spent a night bingeing \u201cGourmet Makes\u201d and \u201ca lightbulb went off\u2014I knew I had to draw Claire,\u201d she told me. \u201cAfter sticking with Claire in her quest to make Twinkies, as she bakes tray after tray of snack cakes using every tool and technique that she knows, it\u2019s so amazing when she hits the nail on the head and there are actual gourmet Twinkies sitting there on the counter.\u201dIllustration by Ian WorthingtonArtist Ian Worthington \u201cwas inspired by Claire\u2019s iconic grey-streaked hair!\u201d He said of his sketch, above. \u201cIt\u2019s such a cool and stunning look, I imagine illustrators find it very evocative. I\u2019m also just a big fan of the series and wanted to draw something in tribute.\u201d (FYI, he also sketched Brad Leone of \u201cIt\u2019s Alive!\u201d test kitchen fame.)Illustration by Seiji IgeArtist Seiji Ige also took his pencil to both Claire and Brad in this sketchbook on Instagram. \u201cAfter hitting artist\u2019s block, I generally find myself watching more new things that I had been meaning to watch\u2014Claire\u2019s videos were that thing.\u201d He told me. \u201cI also really connected with her moments of stress and bliss trying to get her recreations of snacks just right.\u201dA few more:Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.A fan even compiled every Claire-Brad moment into this 13 minute video, writing, \u201cI created this for the good of humankind.
