They\u2019re a shortcut to many of my favorite breakfasts, from chia pudding to smoothies, especially when hot weather makes turning on my stove undesirable. But I\u2019ve been frustrated with the contents of the refrigerated aisle these days, largely due to a desire to cut down on single-use packaging and the potpourri of stabilizers found in many alt milk brands.I\u2019ve flirted with making my own almond milk from scratch in the past, but soaking and squeezing big quantities of raw nuts is a messy activity that doesn\u2019t come cheap. And, somehow, I always manage to snack or cook my way through my nut stash before I actually find the time to make milk. Then a coworker tipped me off to JOI\u2019s organic oat and nut milk concentrates. The ingredient lists are short. JOI\u2019s shelf-stable Organic Almond Base is made from just one ingredient\u2014blanched organic almonds. It\u2019s basically like an unroasted, easily emulsified nut butter. And JOI\u2019s Organic Oat Milk Powder (made from, you guessed it, organic milled oats) even comes in compostable packaging that\u2019s backyard-bin approved.Photograph courtesy of JoiJOI Organic Oat Milk Powder$16 at JOIMaking milk is as simple as whirring together JOI and water for thirty seconds using either a blender or a portable milk frother. I\u2019ve found that watching the clock is key\u2014blend too long, and it\u2019ll separate. One 12-oz pouch of oat milk powder makes 4 quarts of oat milk, and the 15-oz tub of nut milk base (which also comes in cashew) yields 7 quarts. Mine doesn\u2019t stretch quite that far since I like to add an extra teaspoon or two of powder or base each time I blend for a luxurious, silky-smooth texture. After reconstituting, your alt-milks can chill in the fridge for up to a week.Let the record show: I have tried way more than my fair share of nut milk concentrates over the years, and JOI\u2019s is infinitely creamier than the rest\u2014never gooey or gritty. Every Sunday, I take down my blender to make two cups for the week ahead. When I\u2019ve worked my way through a jar of nut milk concentrate, I throw it in my recycling crate, which is noticeably emptier now that it\u2019s not filled with half-gallon containers of alt milk. And as for the oat milk powder, once the bag is empty I take it over to my neighborhood community garden and bury it in the compost bin. Then I walk home in the summer heat, dreaming of the blueberry-tahini smoothie I\u2019ll whir up with as my reward.JOI Organic Almond Milk Concentrate$25 at JOI (for 1)$48 at Amazon (for 2)Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingRead MorecultureThe Joyoung Makes the Best Soy Milk (And All the Other Milks Too)By Clarissa WeishoppingThe 6 Best Vegan Ice Creams of Summer 2021, According to MeBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
