Using a Microplane, finely grate lemongrass, chile (seeds and all!), garlic, and ginger into a medium bowl. (Alternatively, you can chop very finely, then mash to a paste using the side of your knife.) Add brown sugar, oil, fish sauce, and soy sauce and mix well.Step 2Season chicken with salt and add to bowl. Turn as needed to coat completely. Let sit at least 10 minutes and up to 2 hours. (If marinating longer, wait to fire up the grill.)Step 3Grill chicken over hottest part of grill, moving to cooler zone as needed if browning too fast, until well browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before slicing.Step 4Transfer chicken to a platter and top with scallions and cilantro and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over.How would you rate Simple Marinated Chicken Thighs?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (11)Back to TopTriangleYummy! Spicy!JaniceOmaha, NE 9/28/2021Absolutely delicious and will be added to permanent repertoire.  I didn't have lemongrass or serrano so just added extra garlic and some red chili flakes.   Already thinking of how to make this maybe as a cold salad with rice noodles, cukes, chopped peanuts, snow peas....endless possibilities.   Also could be good as a sandwich maybe with homemade raita?   We'll see.....yogamomGreat Falls, VA6/29/2021The marinade is excellent and can be adjusted for spicing - judiciously - upward.  The instructions for grilling or baking, however, are vague. One has to guess how hot the grill or oven should be and whether the thighs should be seared and then finished at a lower temperature.  \nAlso - attention to weights and measures - I write from Toronto Canada, where we use metric and Celsius.  Please do not fixate on American provinicialisms of ounces, pounds and Fahrenheit!Michael LanphierToronto ON, CA6/18/2021I am obsessed. Granted, I modified this a bit. Didn\u2019t have lemongrass or serrano, so I subbed sambal and upped the garlic a bit. I also seared the thighs in a cast iron and finished them in the oven. I added the rendered fat to a pan with the leftover marinade and added some additional soy sauce and some water. Let that come to a boil and reduced to a glaze. I ate these with sushi rice and a loooot of scallions. Amazing. Madison ReidSouth Bend, Indiana2/11/2021So good!  These were easy to make and delicious.  I marinated the chicken for a little over an hour, grilled it until crispy around the edges and served it with cilantro lime rice and sugar snap peas tossed in sesame oil and sesame seeds.  This will become a staple in our household!  Thank you!KaySan Francisco, CA1/7/2021Delicious! Simple to throw together and full of flavor. The marinade doesn't seem like enough, but it really sticks and coats the chicken in a way that infuses a lot of flavor even when it's on the grill.  Will definitely add this to my list of regular summer recipes. AnonymousChicago6/29/2020Delicious!! Really authentic flavours and taste can't wait to make this againAustralia6/24/2020This marinade is nek level amazing! I made with a Bill Granger inspired rice noodle salad, but my god this is a regular staple in my house and I cannot wait to smell it off the bbq all summer long. An amazing find and great recipe! I love Chris!AnonymousLondon6/17/2020Amazing flavor!  It starts out a little sweet and leaves a little burn.  I marinated it for 1 1/2 hrs and grilled.  My 16 yr old wants to take the leftovers to school tomorrow.  Big hit for our family and will definitely make again!  Julie BrownAustin, Texas11/20/2019I wasn't able to get my grill to work and this recipe was STILL incredible.  This marinade was so amazing that I took the excess and boiled it with soy sauce, honey, and white wine to make a sauce.  I served it with some cilantro-lime rice and my mother called it the best thing I've made to date.AnonymousRaleigh, NC9/13/2019This recipe was a winner. Super quick to throw together, had a good kick of spice, and it was very flavourful.
