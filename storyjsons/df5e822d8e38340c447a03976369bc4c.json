Some cut-up grapefruit goes in, and there\u2019s extra crunch from toasted coconut flakes. The grapefruit adds a touch of bitterness that goes well with the salty soy-and-ginger dressing, but oranges and tangerines also work.Ingredients8 Servings4bunches Tuscan kale (1\u00bd lb.), ribs and stems removed2Tbsp. plus \u00bd cup grapeseed or vegetable oilKosher salt\u2153cup fresh lemon juice3Tbsp. low-sodium soy sauce or tamari3Tbsp. tahini2tsp. honey2tsp. toasted sesame oil2tsp. finely grated peeled ginger1small garlic clove, finely grated1medium shallot, thinly sliced1small red or green Thai or serrano \tchile, thinly sliced1\u00bdcups unsweetened coconut flakes2medium grapefruits\u00becup cilantro leaves with tender stems or mint leaves, torn if largePreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 375\u00b0.

I omitted the coconut and added chickpeas, but kept everything else the same. Really, really great. Definitely will make again.AmandaDetroit, MI1/26/2021What a dazzling winter salad. The dressing, as everyone else mentioned, is outstanding. I'm docking one star because the addition of the serrano pepper was extremely controversial at this dinner table. Without the chile, this salad would be broadly popular\u2014 refreshing, yet somehow deeply satisfying \u2014 but the waves of heat made it unpalatable to some. Yet everyone loved the textures, colors, and balance of flavors.Kevin ZSan Diego, CA12/4/2020This dish was delicious - all the tastes are present. Recipe pretty easy to follow. My guests loved it. Thanks for creative ways to serve greens. MillieCalifornia, Mo11/29/2020This salad was my favorite dish at the Thanksgiving table. All of the flavors worked really well together. I wasn't really sure how to add in the kale chips...tossed they get chewy, topping the salad just hid all the other colors and textures. I will make this recipe again, just maybe omit or save the kale chips for snacking.Nicole STruckee, CA11/27/2020Made this recipe for Thanksgiving, as I'm always disappointed by the salads made as an afterthought side \"because we thought we should.\" While it's a little more effort than the chop-and-toss status quo, I really loved this salad and look forward to making it again! It's got great texture and the creamy umami rich dressing pairs beautifully with the sharpness of the grapefruits.TrishaPortland, OR11/27/2020This salad was a pleasant surprise.  The grapefruit with the dressing was delightful.  I would use this salad dressing again and again.  I originally made this salad because I had all of the ingredients and didn't want to go out of the house.  Was not expecting the flavors to work so well together.  It was easy to make and absolutely delicious.  If, for no other reason, you should try this for the dressing.AnonymousDallas, TX11/24/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladKaleLeafy GreensVegetableGingerHerbs & SpicesCoconutFruitFallSideDairy-FreeVegetarianKetoHealthyishThanksgivingDinnerRecipes you want to make.
