Poetic, right? Andy wanted to develop the simplest version of classic bolognese that delivers exactly what it\u2019s supposed to without any unnecessary bells and whistles. \u201cI was inspired by Marcella Hazan, evenings at Via Carota, my desire for an Italian heritage in my youth, Paul Bertolli, Chez Panisse, Chris Morocco\u2026\u201d The resulting recipe is a meat sauce that, after two hours cook time, turns soft, tender, and velvety. No ingredient outshines another. \u201cThe sauce should cling on to noodles, draping and coating each strand,\u201d said Andy. Here\u2019s the bolognese breakdown:The meatAt first, Andy tried to convince us that the meat should be hand-chopped skirt steak, painstakingly chopped by you. \u201cLol no,\u201d was the general feedback. \u201cIt\u2019s a more interesting cut of meat,\u201d he pleaded, but that homestead aesthetic was not what we were going for this time, and it certainly wasn\u2019t easier than buying ground chuck. We\u2019re going with ground chuck, plus some pancetta for a fuller, meatier final flavor. The chuck gets browned for a few crucial minutes before the low and slow Sunday sauce simmer begins. A NOTE: If cooked on too high a heat, ground beef will turn into a rubber band. That\u2019s why we keep the heat low, and why it takes so damn long to reach that final velvet state.The tomato pasteNO CANNED TOMATO ZONE. Tomato paste only this time! It adds color, body, and acidity. \u201cWater from canned tomatoes would dilute the flavor and texture,\u201d said Andy. \u201cI don\u2019t want pieces of tomato in my sauce. I want it to be rustica, not fancy.\u201dThe milk and chicken stock and wineThose are the only liquids we need. The milk adds more fat content, a.k.a. \u201crichness,\u201d and helps the beef achieve that velvety consistency. The stock rounds out the meat flavor and gives the beef something to cook down in without drying out. The wine adds acidity.The aromatics, featuring carrotsWe pulse the aromatics\u2014carrot, onion, celery\u2014in a food processor until they\u2019re practically the same size as the ground meat. That consistency in size keeps one flavor in the sauce from dominating, and we\u2019re especially looking at you, carrots.The lone bay leafThat mystery aromatic strikes again.The pastaHot take from Andy here. NO DRIED PAPPARDELLE, or other wide noodles, he insisted. He tried several brands, they all broke too often and caused him immense stress. If you can use fresh pappardelle or tagliatelle, rejoice. If you\u2019re using dry pasta, go with rigatoni. It catches the sauce in its ridges and tube better than anything else. (The Test Kitchen stans De Cecco)The attitude\u201cIt\u2019s a meat sauce, not a tomato sauce,\u201d Andy reminded me. \u201cPeople have an idea of what they want bolognese to be, but it\u2019s hard to pinpoint. This recipe is not a restaurant dish. It\u2019s a Sunday sauce. I\u2019m not trying to hurt you. Take a photo, tag me. If you have problems, tag me too.\u201d We\u2019re family now.Get the recipe:BA's Best BologneseIt doesn\u2019t take a lot of ingredients (or a lot of money) to make a classic Bolognese recipe.
