Think of it like the Butterball Turkey Talk-Line, but on the other end of the phone you\u2019ve got Carla Lalli Music, Claire Saffitz, and Brad Leone. Here, we compiled just a few of the most helpful (or just plain interesting) questions and answers that came across our Hotline for everyone to use. We like to think of it as our unofficial Thanksgiving 2019 FAQ page. If you\u2019d rather watch the Test Kitchen answer them, head to our Instagram Story Highlights, saved under \u201cDM Hotline.\u201dWe\u2019re here to help.\nPhoto by Laura MurrayCan you parbake your stuffing the day before to cut down on cooking time on Thanksgiving day?\u201cYou can cook your stuffing up to three days before, but make sure it\u2019s wrapped tightly in foil and kept in the fridge before you parbake it. On Thanksgiving day, let it come to room temp and right before you\u2019re ready to serve it, blast it in the oven at 425 for 15 minutes.\u201d \u2014Rick MartinezFor dry brining a turkey, do you wipe off the salt/sugar mixture before putting in the oven?\u201cGenerally speaking, you should wipe off the brine off with a dry paper towel, unless the recipe says to keep it on.\u201d \u2014Carla Lalli MusicHow can I keep a pie from getting soggy during the day?\u201cFor pumpkin, pecan, apple, and other fruit pies: After you\u2019ve baked them, you can let them hang out at room temperature. Just pop them in the oven at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for 5 minutes before you\u2019re ready to serve. For custard pies (like lemon, banana, or chocolate): Don\u2019t fill the pie crust until you\u2019re ready to serve. Refresh the crust the same way (above), and then pour in the set custard once you\u2019re ready to serve.\u201d \u2014Sohla El-WayllyI\u2019m supposed to bring wine for Thanksgiving. Any recommendations for a large, but picky crowd?\u201cGo for a high-acid rose (look for bottles from Austria or Eastern Europe) and a low-tannin red (something like a Poulsard or a Burgundy Pinot Noir). Don\u2019t go for just one\u2014diversify! And after dinner, Barolo Chinato is the answer. It\u2019s the digestivo that\u2019ll satisfy everyone at the table.\u201d \u2014Alex DelanyI could use some words of encouragement as I attempt to bake my first-ever pie from scratch. Any tips would be helpful!\u201cConsider the temperature of the ingredients! Keep your hands cold, keep the bowl cold, and most importantly, make sure you always keep the butter cold. That will get you the flakiest pie dough. Also: Bake your pie on a baking sheet, just in case it drips or leaks.\u201d \u2014Sarah JampelWhat are your tips for grocery shopping on thanksgiving?\u201cWrite down all of your ingredients. Cross-check with what you already have at home. And when you get to the grocery store, stick to the list. Don\u2019t buy more than what you need; your fridge is already going to be crammed.\u201d \u2014Gaby MelianYou\u2019re better than a mediocre pie.\nPhoto by Laura MurrayIs cranberry sauce really worth making?\u201cAbsolutely. If there\u2019s ONE thing that you should make yourself on Thanksgiving, it should be cranberry sauce. Three ingredients. Go. You can make it ahead of time and leave it in the fridge, and it\u2019ll bring tartness to all of the fatty-rich foods on the table.\u201d \u2014Chris MoroccoMy brother broke his jaw recently and can\u2019t chew much, but loves apple pie. How can I make my apple pie mushier for him so he can enjoy it, without ruining it for everyone else? Smaller slices? Cook it longer?\u201cThis is a great time to blitz a slice of pie with some ice cream and top it with whipped cream. Apple pie milkshake! Take it as far as you need for him to be able to eat it, but if you can keep some texture, do. And then watch as everyone else at the table heads to the blender.\u201d \u2014Priya KrishnaWhat is the best time to eat on thanksgiving?\u201cThanksgiving is the only time you\u2019re allowed to start dinner at 4 p.m. But if you show up at my house before 12 p.m., I will not let you in.\u201d \u2014Christina ChaeyExplore Bon App\u00e9titThanksgivingPieStuffingMake AheadMashed PotatoesTurkeyCranberry SauceRecipes you want to make.
