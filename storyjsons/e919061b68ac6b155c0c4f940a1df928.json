Social distancing and self isolation may have put our usual gym routines and exercise classes on an indefinite hold, but we\u2019re still breaking a sweat thanks to the rise of livestreams, apps, and classic analog methods. (Solo jogging will never go out of style.) Whether we\u2019re tuning into virtual versions of our favorite classes or giving new apps a try, this is how Bon Appetit staffers are working out from home right now.I've sung the praises of Dance Church\u00ae on every platform and to every person in my life. While classes in New York, Seattle, Portland, Indianapolis, Salt Lake City, and Los Angeles are shuttered, instructors are livestreaming twice a week, bringing 50 minutes of pure, unbridled, physical joy to thousands of people around the world, including me. With very little choreography and an emphasis on ~feeling yourself~, Dance Church\u00ae is one of the few physical and mental escapes I've found in recent weeks, which makes it worth waaaay more than the $15 suggested donation.  \u2013Amanda Shapiro, Healthyish editorInstagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.I've been working out EVERY DAY using the Aaptiv app, which is a collection of audio workouts. Today, I did yoga and a 23-minute run-walk interval workout (since I haven't jogged in years, I\u2019m easing into it). Tomorrow I'll blast out like 45 minutes of strength training, hopefully somewhere outside where people can laugh at me frantically punching the air. I've pledged, to myself and Christina Chaey, that I'm coming out of this Q with a 6-pack. I'll settle for two, tbh.  \u2013Alex Beggs, senior staff writerMy wife Ava and I have turned our living room into a \"stretching zone.\" We have two yoga mats set up, and every morning we post up for some casual but deep recovery. (I don't know about you, but our kitchen chairs are NOT built for working from home all day.) The pilates \"roll like a ball\" exercise has been great for my achy back and the 90/90 hip stretch helps release a lot of the tension I'm holding (and not just in my muscles and joints). We also do 50 squats together in the evening. It's a bizarre time to do it, but it's a nice way to squeeze out any pent up energy before climbing into bed. \u2014Sasha Levine, bonappetit.com editorThis is the time of year when I usually start to plan longer bike rides all around the city and the Tri-State area. But longer rides aren't nearly as fun without friends, so I've been trying to come up with novel solutions that will motivate me to get on two wheels. I normally ride my bike to the office in Tribeca, so I'm thinking about trying out a morning \"commute\" to work where I bike across the Brooklyn Bridge, ride up lower Manhattan, cross the Williamsburg Bridge back into Brooklyn, then ride back home to my new \"office\" in Crown Heights. I'm desperately seeking ways to bring the normalcy of my regular routine back into my life, and this is one way to do that. \u2013Christina Chaey, associate editorInstagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.As often as I can, I step away from Slack, push away my coffee table, and spend my lunch hour tuning into Sky Ting\u2019s daily yoga livestream. Led by founders Krissy Jones and Chloe Kernaghan, along with a rotating cast of studio instructors, the hour-long class is a welcome respite from my usual afternoon routine of hunching over my laptop on the couch. I often find myself pushing off workouts when random tasks pop up throughout the day, so having a set hour helps me stick to my \u201croutine.\u201d And while this might say more about me than these workouts, I\u2019m actually sore the next morning. \u2013Aliza Abarbanel, Healthyish assistant editorRecently, I dug out the rebounder trampoline that was folded up in the back of the closet and put it on my patio. I've always preferred long walks to working out regularly, but since I'm trying really hard to limit my outside time due to crowded sidewalks, this is a great way to get in a little fun, joint-friendly cardio. It also helps give my 2 roommates and I a little space from one another...although I wouldn't recommend it to someone who lives above another apartment. \u2013Christa Guerra, art directorI used to spend every Tuesday evening in an extremely muggy dance studio in the West Village with about 150 other people partaking in something called 5Rhythms. The best way I can describe it is dance meditation, except you sweat a LOT and at one point people might be crawling around on the floor howling. It's very legit. Anyway, since the lockdown I've been hosting 5Rhythms dance workshops in my teeny kitchen for my husband and cats. You dance the same series of rhythms each time\u2014flowing, staccato, chaos, lyrical, stillness\u2014starting off slow, building to extremely fast, then mellowing out again. It releases tension better than anything else I've tried. The last session ended with my cat biting me and scratching my wrist vertically but I think he too was enjoying it up until that point. Here's a playlist if you want to try it out; no choreography, just dance! \u2013Hilary Cadigan,associate editorI downloaded an app called Shred, which is more approachable than it sounds. It does a great job at configuring a workout for you by taking consideration into how much time you have and what equipment you have. I have no equipment at the moment, so I\u2019ve been doing some mobility work and with body weight exercises, along with running almost everyday. \u2013Andy Baraghani, senior food editorInstagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Now that my gym is closed and I'm at my parents' house, the Nike Training Club app has helped me keep up my routine. I first heard about it from senior food editor Molly Baz, who loves it because the workouts are tailored to the amount of time and equipment you have on hand, no matter where you are. Here's how it works: You choose a workout by time, equipment, or muscle group, press the start button, and the app guides you through the entire workout, with someone on the screen doing it along with you and cheering you on. The video is so helpful for me in terms of getting the right form; I'm terrible at written instructions. Even with no equipment, there are plenty of workouts to choose from. My friends all use the app now, and we'll trade tips on which workouts we liked the best (I like Lunges and Length, Upper Body Express, and Cut to the Core). The app has recently made all the premium workouts free, so I have more options than ever.  \u2013Priya Krishna, contributing writerI\u2019m dancing like no one is watching...because literally no one is watching. I often go to a dance class in Tribeca called MOVES and the teachers, Marisa Competello and Lauren Gerrie, are keeping the spirit alive with some live stream videos on their Instagram account. Dancing helps me feel revitalized and empowered\u2014plus it makes me move the funny muscles I forget to engage while leading a life of lounging! \u2013Miriam Ross, associate art directorI've been streaming a different workout each morning\u2014yoga at Y7, pilates with Kelly Berry, circuit training at Punch Pedal House. Now is a great time to discover new fitness routines. I've even added salsa dancing to my list. I don't think I would have ever signed up for an in-studio class, but with the extra time at home, I'm excited to give it a try with cheesy instructional Youtube videos like this one. \u2013Michelle Heimerman, senior visuals editorMy husband turned me onto the Fitness Blender workout videos \u2014 we are resolutely not gym people. The programs are all pretty affordable, about $15 each, and much more goal-oriented than if you just wanted to bop around the free offerings\u2014you can sync the videos to your calendar, so you know exactly which days are arm days, which are legs, etc. I recently got into the low impact program, mainly because our third floor New York apartment is too much of a sardine can for the very active high-intensity interval training modules, which require a lot of jumping around. (Of course, I'd be lying if I didn't mention that the chance to avoid burpees topped my must-haves list.) \u2013Joseph Hernandez, research directorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishSelf CareCoronavirusRead MoreCoronavirus17 Ways to Feel Good at Home Right NowBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
