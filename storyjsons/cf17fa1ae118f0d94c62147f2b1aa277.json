Delayed and canceled flights, untimely airport power outages, lost bags\u2014the list is endless and frequently updated. My luck with places to stay isn\u2019t much better (I\u2019m talking to you, flooded Italian Airbnb). That is, until I checked into The Siren hotel in Detroit.ASH NYC, a very cool design and development firm based in Brooklyn, designed the hotel, and it looks like it\u2019s straight out of a Wes Anderson film in the least kitschy way possible. The lobby is a dreamy space filled with opulent velvet furniture, stacks of vintage Holiday magazines, and a color palette I need to apply to my own life (olive green, burnt orange, deep navy blue). The rooms are no-frills\u2014and affordable, with rates starting at around $100 a night\u2014but that doesn\u2019t make The Siren feel any less special.Come for the cocktails, stay for the vibes.\nPhoto by Christian HarderPlus, Candy Bar, the intimate cocktail lounge on the lobby level from local chef Kate Williams, is a perfect place for a nightcap. The last time I was at The Siren, I grabbed a bubbly cocktail and cozied up in a pink velvet booth in the corner before heading back up to my room, feeling ready to take on yet another delayed flight and lost bag.Go there: The SirenExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendHotelsDetroitRead MorerestaurantsWhy I'll Be Spending My Entire D.C.
