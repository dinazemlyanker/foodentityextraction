You can\u2019t put it down, you can\u2019t walk away from it, and you can\u2019t ignore it. Its needs are simple, it just wants all of you. And if you give it all of your patient attention, it will turn into a puddle of love. This simple, pure, unadulterated version stands up on its own, but it also makes an excellent canvas for seasonal ingredients\u2014find out more about those toppings at the very end of the recipe.\u00a0All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Bring to a very bare simmer over medium heat.Step 2Meanwhile, heat oil in a 6-qt. Dutch oven over medium. Cook onion and a pinch of salt, stirring frequently, until onion is translucent and starting to soften, 6\u20138 minutes. Add \u00bd cup water and cook, stirring often, until water evaporates and onion is sizzling in oil and completely tender, about 5 minutes. (Adding the water allows the onion to cook gently and thoroughly without taking on any color.) Taste onion; if it\u2019s still firm at all, add another splash of water and continue cooking until meltingly soft.Step 3Add rice and stir well to coat with oil. Cook, stirring constantly, until grains of rice are translucent around the edges and they make a glassy clattering sound when they hit the sides and bottom of pot, about 5 minutes. Coating the grains with oil before adding any liquid helps the rice cook evenly so that the outside does not become mushy before the center is tender. Add wine and another pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until wine is completely evaporated, about 2 minutes.Step 4Reduce heat to medium, then add hot salted water to rice in \u00be-cup increments, stirring constantly and allowing liquid to absorb fully before adding more, until rice is al dente and surrounded by fluid, not-too-thick creamy suspension, 25\u201330 minutes. It should take 2\u20133 minutes for each addition to be absorbed; if things are moving faster than this, reduce heat to medium-low. Gradual absorption and constant agitation are key to encouraging the starches to release from the risotto, creating its trademark creamy consistency. You may not need all of the hot water, but err on the side of soup rather than sludge. The finished texture should be more of a liquid than a solid. Start checking the rice after about 15 minutes; the grains should be tender but not mushy, with a slightly firm center that doesn\u2019t leave a chalky or bitty residue between your teeth after tasting. Do not overcook!Step 5Remove pot from heat, add butter, and stir until melted. Gradually add 1\u00bc cups Parmesan, stirring until cheese is melted and liquid surrounding risotto is creamy but very fluid. Stir in more hot salted water if needed to achieve the right consistency. Taste and season with salt.Step 6Divide risotto among warm bowls. Top each with a grind of pepper. Serve with remaining \u00bd cup Parmesan alongside for passing.TOPPINGSBA\u2019s Best Risotto Parmigiano is good enough to serve on its own, but it\u2019s also an excellent canvas for a whole host of toppings. Here are a few options we love, for whatever season you\u2019re in.Photo by TED + CHELSEA CAVANAUGH, Food Styling by Simon AndrewsSpring: Buttered Sugar Snap Peas with MintHeat 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter in a large skillet over medium until foaming, about 1 minute. Add finely chopped white and light green parts of 5 scallions, season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until scallions are bright green and aromatic, 1\u20132 minutes. Add 1 lb. sugar snap peas (trimmed, cut in half lengthwise), season again, and cook, tossing occasionally, until crisp-tender, 2\u20133 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in \u00bd cup sliced mint leaves. Spoon peas and any pan juices onto BA\u2019s Best Risotto.Photo by TED + CHELSEA CAVANAUGH, Food Styling by Simon AndrewsSummer: Burst Cherry Tomato SauceHeat 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter and 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a large skillet over medium until butter is foaming. Add 4 crushed garlic cloves, season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until garlic is aromatic and starting to brown, 1\u20132 minutes. Add 2 pints cherry tomatoes and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, tossing frequently and pressing down on tomatoes with a wooden spoon to encourage skins to split, about 5 minutes. Add \u00bd tsp. red pepper flakes and toss to combine. Taste and season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, if needed. Spoon tomatoes and pan sauce onto BA\u2019s Best Risotto. Drizzle with oil.Photo by TED + CHELSEA CAVANAUGH, Food Styling by Simon AndrewsFall: Browned Mushrooms with ThymeHeat \u00bc cup extra-virgin olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Add 1 lb. mushrooms (such as shiitake, crimini, or maitake, trimmed, caps torn into 2\" pieces) and cook, tossing occasionally, until they begin to soften and release some liquid, 3\u20134 minutes. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper and cook, tossing occasionally, until deeply browned and tender, 8\u201310 minutes. Add 5 crushed garlic cloves, 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, and 4\u20135 sprigs thyme and cook, tossing occasionally, until garlic softens and butter is golden brown, about 3 minutes more. Remove from heat and add 2 Tbsp. white wine vinegar or fresh lemon juice. Toss to coat, scraping up any browned bits from surface of pan. Pluck out thyme sprigs.

Another rice  species  that's ideal for risotto is vialone nano.  It's flavor is somewhat more robust compared to carnaroli, and is, in my opinion,  ideal if you're preparing a risotto with meat or poultry inclusions.George ArnoldBoston, MA1/5/2022This is the best risotto I\u2019ve ever made. I followed the recipe as written and used the winter add-ins\nOf lemon zest, lemon juice, and green onions (green part only) since I didn\u2019t have fresh chives) Wow!! Even my young grandchildren couldn\u2019t get enough. They asked for seconds. This will now be a staple in my kitchen.TommysdebiOrlando, FL1/3/2022Made the recipe as described. Worked out great. Would make againBheavyOmaha, ne12/27/2021super great risotto recipe, but I would use appropriate stock instead of salted water.Wine is everythingCharleston SC11/4/2021Why not list the traditional ARBORIO rice for this recipe?KamaJoshua Tree, CA, USA10/27/2021Best risotto recipe I've ever made, and I've many. So creamy, such a clean taste.  Important to use wonderful rice, parmesan, etc.  We topped it with grated bottarga to try to replicate a dish I had in a wonderful restaurant in NYC. Transcendent! :) AnonymousSt Petersburg, FL10/13/2021Wow, excellent.  Did the mushroom, thyme version.  Perfect outcomeTraceyDanville, CA9/13/2021Too good!  Of course a lot of time and attention,and so worth it!MaryMLatonia, Ky.7/13/2021spot on!! kept adding water and stirring, made nice soup like stew, added the butter, and 2 cups of cheese, was heaven in a bowl.  Used tomato topper, doubled the red pepper, we were thrilled with this recipe. THANK YOU :)  PS my grand parents in the US only spoke Italian.AnonymousFredericksburg VA,  originally Dearborn, MI6/2/2021Carla's instructions are spot on!! Love the buttery flavor, and adding more salted water than you think you need is key to success!! this Risotto recipe does not overshadow any main dish, it compliments it. Favorite easy, risotto recipe I've made!\nChefGigiTraIllinois5/23/2021I'm a chef (retired) living in Milano, where Risotto rules, there seems to be a concern about the amount of wine, in Italia many people don't even use wine. When I make risotto I don't really measure the wine, but I would estimate for two cups of rice I use about 1/2 glass of wine would be sufficient, you don't want to have drunken rice, you know how unruly rice gets when it's over the beveraged.  The final steps are the most important, stirring in the butter and Parmigiano vigorously to achieve a creaminess in Italian it's called (manticare) and then shaking the pan back and forth to make waves, onde.  The risotto at this point should be streamed onto a flat plate and eaten from the outer edge and inward. Buon appetito. \n\n pacepuleoMilano Italy4/19/2021Yes, this is the best risotto I\u2019ve made. (You only have to read to the first step of the recipe to know that there\u2019s water in the recipe.) Easily adaptable and so comforting. Emily HCalgary 2/24/2021Great recipe except you failed to listed the stock quantity. One cup of wine will not be sufficient to groom the rice or add enough rich flavor.  Perhaps an error. Mrs. KareenLondon, UK1/6/2021Made it exactly according to directions (which I almost never do) and it was excellent. I was pleasantly surprised to end up with such a flavourful risotto without using stock. Using a delicious wine is key; don\u2019t use one you wouldn\u2019t want to drink. And obviously freshly grated parm. I also made the burst tomatoes, but with Sambal Olek in place of the crushed pepper flakes just because. Really tasty!PierieCalgary, AB12/20/2020Perfect.  Made a fantastic neutral base risotto.  This is a new go-to.\nChef KoalaSeattle, WA12/12/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titRisottoItalianEuropeanRiceRice & Grains5 Ingredients or FewerSideGluten-FreeNut-FreeVegetarianRecipes you want to make.
