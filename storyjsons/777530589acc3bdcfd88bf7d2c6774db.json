How\u2019d I become so in touch with myself, you ask? Take one look at my fridge: Right now I have eight pounds of cultured butter, three types of yogurt, a container of creme fraiche and sour cream, oh, and three quarts of kefir all ready for me to use.But I\u2019ve stockpiled so much fermented dairy because I use it in everything\u2014a bright olive sauce for roasted squash, the marinade for my chicken biryani, chewy grains bathed in buttermilk\u2014and because it can last a while, an important thing as my grocery shops become fewer and farther between. But it\u2019s also because fermented dairy is the key to one of my favorite dinners: a cheerfully green pasta so creamy and tangy and delicious, you won\u2019t be able to look at mac and cheese the same way again.Based on shish barak, little lamb and pine-nut dumplings served in a garlicky yogurt sauce from the Levant (a region that really loves its fermented dairy), it borrows many of the same ingredients, but recomposes them on the plate. There\u2019s whole-milk yogurt (or kefir plus egg yolks) blended up with garlic and dill for the bright sauce. There\u2019s spiced lamb seared so hard it reminds me of my mother\u2019s charred koftas. And then there\u2019s chewy-sweet dried currants and butter-toasted pine nuts to top it all off.But what makes this dish everything I need and want right now is how flexible it is. Sure, the recipe calls for full-fat yogurt or kefir, but if all you\u2019ve got is the thicker Greek stuff, just use less and add a bit of pasta water. Only buttermilk in your fridge? Add an extra yolk for more body. No lamb? Any ground meat will work. Or keep it vegetarian with some wilted greens, creamy lima beans, or crisp-tender asparagus instead. No pine nuts? Use whatever nut you\u2019ve got, just chop them up to roughly pine nut size so there\u2019s buttery crunch with every bite. Out of currants? Use any dried fruit, taking care to dice up the larger specimens. No dill but lush with chives and parsley? That sounds absolutely perfect, too. Orecchiette are great, but elbows, penne, rigatoni, and shells will all shine.What I\u2019m trying to say is, no matter what you do, everything will be fine. This is a forgiving recipe, which is exactly what we all need right now. That, and a few more pints of labne.Get the recipe:Spiced Lamb and Dill Yogurt PastaYou\u2019ll find all the flavors of Middle Eastern shish barak (tiny lamb and pine nut) dumplings here, but made simpler and brighter with help from dried pasta and plenty of fresh dill.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPastaRecipes you want to make.
