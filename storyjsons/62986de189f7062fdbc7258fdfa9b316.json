BBQAt the Houston restaurant, actual brothers Robin and Terry Wong and pitmaster Quy Hoang bring their respective roots to barbecue.By Daniel VaughnAugust 26, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Hayden SpearsFacebookTwitterEmailIn Dish Decoded, we break down all the components, stories, and techniques behind a restaurant\u2019s... well... dish that we\u2019re obsessed with right now.They were the pop-up barbecue kings of Houston. Determined to offer a new perspective on Texas barbecue, brothers Robin and Terry Wong, who also operate a karaoke bar, and their best friend from high school, pitmaster Quy Hoang, spent their weekends setting up shop in various bars around the city, playing tunes and slinging pork ribs and their famous gochujang beef belly burnt ends to a growing crowd of devotees. Then late last year they went permanent, opening up a no-frills space dubbed Blood Bros. BBQ in Bellaire, on the city\u2019s west edge. Here, they blend flavors from the Wongs\u2019 Chinese heritage and Hoang\u2019s Vietnamese roots with the Texas barbecue they grew up with, unafraid to test the boundaries of tradition. We met up with the trio to break down each item on a classic tray, from the hot-smoked meats to the soy-laced sauces.Brisket Fried RiceWhen slicing brisket, Hoang saves the burnt ends for fried rice, his best-selling side. The familiar peas, carrots, and eggs are plenty visible, but the unique tang comes from Hoang\u2019s secret ingredient: kimchi.Smoked Turkey Banh MiA crusty-yet-fluffy baguette from the French Riviera Bakery down the street gets layered with smoked turkey, house-pickled daikon, jalapen\u0303os, and a nice thick schmear of Terry Wong\u2019s house-made chicken liver pa\u0302te\u0301.Thai Peanut Butter Sticky RibsBarbecue purists, avert your eyes. These pork ribs come slathered in an umami-rich blend of peanut butter, ketchup, soy sauce, and Thai red curry paste\u2014with chopped peanuts and Thai chiles for texture and heat.Smoked BrisketA Pitmaker offset smoker is Hoang\u2019s weapon of choice. He bathes his beef in oak and pecan smoke for more than eight hours. The seasoning is pure Texas: salt, pepper, garlic, chipotle powder, and a kick of cayenne.Thai Green Curry BoudinHoang makes curry sauce with lemongrass and Thai basil, then adds pork shoulder, pork liver, jasmine rice, and sticky rice. \u201cI mix my rice right into the curry when I eat Thai food,\u201d he says, \u201cand that\u2019s basically what this boudin is.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titBarbecueTexasChineseVietnameseDish DecodedRead MorecultureI Instagram-Stalked This Croissant, So I Found Out How It\u2019s MadeBy Rachel KartenrestaurantsTurkey Tails Are The Most Delicious Thing You Didn\u2019t Even Know You Could EatBy Elyse InaminecultureThe Halo-Halo at Philadelphia\u2019s Sarvida Is 5 Layers of PerfectionBy Amanda ShapirocultureThis Dive Bar Is Turning Out the Best Burger in OaklandBy Julia KramerRecipes you want to make.
