An insanely flavorful condiment made from toasted grated fresh coconut and tons of aromatics, it can be a topping for any grilled or roasted protein.Ingredients8 servingsPalapa16red Thai chiles6dried shiitake mushrooms1fresh coconut or 4 cups dried unsweetened shredded coconut\u00bccup vegetable oil1bunch scallions, chopped1\u00bdheads of garlic, cloves separated, finely chopped12\" piece ginger, peeled, finely chopped6makrut lime leaves, thinly sliced (optional)3Tbsp. sugar1Tbsp.

Transfer to a small bowl.Step 2Grind mushrooms in a spice mill or with a mortar and pestle (or use food processor again) to a powder.Step 3Hold coconut in one hand and strike it firmly around the equator with the back (blunt side) of a heavy knife or cleaver, rotating coconut as you go until it splits. Whack coconut halves with the back of knife to loosen meat from shell. Remove meat and shred on the large holes of a box grater (or use food processor fitted with grating plate).

Really yummy and savoury. I am Pinoy and however as much as I would like to support this, I feel the need to point out that the Maranao Palapa is nowhere near this iteration. Ingredients and cooking style are nearer to Indonesian Serunding Kelapa (Spicy Coconut Floss) than Filipino Palapa. Mushrooms are substituted for small dried shrimps in the original Indonesian version.GekidanBacolod City, Philippines9/21/2019Made this for a BBQ and it was insane. kmarxmarxchicago8/15/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titFilipinoSoutheast AsianAsianShrimpShellfishSeafoodCoconutFruitChileVegetableThai ChileSummerMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeKetoHealthyishGrillingMemorial DayLabor DayDinnerRecipes you want to make.
