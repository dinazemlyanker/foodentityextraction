I started reading Madhouse at the End of the Earth, Julian Sancton\u2019s account of a dark and doomed expedition to the South Pole in 1897, and I couldn\u2019t stop. I skipped all my weekend chores. I carved a groove into the couch, huddling under a big blanket because, I\u2019m telling you, reading this book makes you feel cold. And scared. And hungry.The story of the Belgica, the name of the ship we\u2019re on, is that a ragtag bunch of men led by the explorer Adrien de Gerlache sailed to Antarctica with the hopes of sticking a Belgian flag on the South Pole. By the time they get to Antarctica, though, winter is quickly encroaching and the ship gets trapped in the rapidly growing sea ice. They\u2019re stuck. Food becomes the key to their survival, and the book is so detailed you can almost smell and taste it as you read. But what you\u2019re smelling and tasting isn\u2019t pretty.Men aboard the Belgica feasting on canned mush. Good thing they packed wine.\nPhoto courtesy Fram MuseumThe book reads like an adventure novel thanks to Sancton\u2019s meticulous research. (Disclosure, I worked with Sancton a decade ago at Vanity Fair when I was an intern. I transcribed his interviews with celebrities, which were less exciting than this book.) We know almost everything that happened on the ship, including what crew members ate, because nearly all of them kept a diary\u2014though one journal was burned for containing too many horrors.De Gerlache, the commander, stocked the galley with what he thought was a gourmet array of canned meals for every occasion: beef tongue, stewed hare, blanquette de veau. But the cranky French chef he hired to cook for them got kicked off the ship at an early port, so the only way they eat the canned food is heated into mush. Every night. For months.\u201cHow we longed to use our teeth!\u201d wrote Frederick Cook, the American doctor on board who would later become a world-famous suspected con man (!) when he claimed to discover the North Pole (he didn\u2019t). Cook had regular check-ins with his crewmates over the long Antarctic winter, during which the sun disappears for six months and so does a man\u2019s sanity. He heard two major complaints from the men. \u201cOne was the absence of female companionship,\u201d Sancton writes. \u201cThe other, more urgent, cause of dissatisfaction was the canned food the men now depended on almost exclusively.\u201d\u201cThe soft, colorless gobs the men found on their plates every night bore little resemblance to whatever dish was promised on the can\u2019s label. Particularly revolting to most were kj\u00f8ttboller, the spongy meatballs that de Gerlache had purchased in Norway...In an effort to vary the flavors, Michotte [the appointed \u201cchef\u201d] would often mix the cans together into a nondescript stew, which was somehow less than the sum of its parts.\u201dAll they had to look forward to, for six sunless months, was dinner. But even that became hard to stomach.The first time they cooked up a slab of penguin meat, the only game in town (the town = huge glaciers of ice and nothing else), \u201cit tasted somehow like both fish and fowl, with a gamey tang.\u201d They decided never to eat it again. Until, that is, a few weeks go by, and the men\u2019s health begins to deteriorate. Their heartbeats were speeding up and slowing down, some had droopy bags of liquid gathering under their eyes, lethargy was rampant. The ship\u2019s first mate, Roald Amundsen, was getting especially sick.Cook recognizes their symptoms as scurvy, and without fresh fruit, vegetables, or meat, they could die of it. He convinces the Belgica boys to give penguin another try, along with seal meat. (Cook had spent time with the Inuit during a previous harrowing Arctic journey and observed that they survived the winter on meat and blubber, often raw.) Cook preferred his penguin steaks lightly seared, but recommended everyone eat them rare if possible.\u201cRemarkably, after just a few days of guzzling down the cutlets, which had the consistency of fatty, uncooked chicken, Amundsen was almost back to normal,\u201d Sancton writes. They didn\u2019t know then what we know now, that the meat contains vitamin C, which is crucial to creating collagen in the body.Scurvy is one of a laundry list of nightmares encountered by the men on this big rat-infested ship in the middle of the Antarctic ice. But the rest are outside the purview of this food publication, so you\u2019ll just have to read the book to find out.Courtesy Crown Publishing\u00a0Madhouse at the End of the Earth$30 $16 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titBooksAntarcticaTravelRecipes you want to make.
