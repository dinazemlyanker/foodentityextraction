We make it in huge quantities during tomato season since it freezes so well. My mom remembers eating it all the time when she was working in the fields in Cambodia\u2014\u201dfood for the people\u201d she calls it. Growing up, I remember camping out at the all-you-can-eat seafood buffet with my family for hours, and we\u2019d always bring our own tuk trey ping poh for dipping. Make a big batch, then fry a cup in a bit of oil to concentrate flavors and create a base for soups, braises, and curries; add a few spoonfuls to a pot of cooked beans or lentils for heat and acidity; or set out as a dip for crudit\u00e9s, shellfish, or raw oysters. \u2014Chinchakriya Un, Kreung Cambodia, Brooklyn, NYThis recipe is part of Short Is Sweet, our collection of summer dishes that deliver a whole lot of deliciousness in 30 minutes or less.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Trichinella is no longer found in the modern world. MattDE8/19/2021Made this a week ago, and this will be added to our rotation most definitely.  The charred vegetable sauce with fish sauce was unbelievable- sweet and funky.  Using the thinly cut chops was great as it allowed for a lot of caramelized pork in a very quick cooking time.  Wifey and I were both members of the clean plate club!Chris from Boston7/12/2021It's safe to eat pork that still has pink in it. Trichinosis is in pork is a thing of the past. Look it up. That said, I will try this recipe next week. Sauce sounds fabulous!LynnWoodbury, CT7/9/2021An amazing sauce. Easy and delicious. My husband said we need to put it on everything! Pork chops were 1/2 inch thick and cooked through in a few minutes on each side in a very hot pan.AnonymousPhoenix, Az6/30/2021Freakin awesome. I got my cast iron pan blazing hot and blasted those thin pork chops. Its a very simple sauce just with few ingredients but utterly delish. I loved the sauce with the chops but I could eat it on some plain steamed rice and be very happy! It\u2019s a keeper. WhistlejacketLaguna Beach Ca6/26/2021The exciting part of this recipe is learning what for most of us is how to make this - previously unknown to many of us - tomato sauce condiment, and people are arguing about the pork chops! Cracks me up!!Dan WConnecticut6/25/2021Y\u2019all need to chill out, 2 minutes per side is perfectly adequate for thin-cut bone-in pork chops! A searing hot pan could OVERcook thin chops in four minutes. Anyway, you\u2019re mainly cooking to kill the parasites (Trichinella spiralis) within the flesh so if you\u2019re going to be squeamish be squeamish about that! \u201cPork is dry but at least I know my parasites are cooked!\u201d\n\nThe sauce sounds lovely. RheaIreland6/25/2021Right off the bat, I'm thinking she meant to say \"thick\". Why because only 4 chop is a case for thick pork chops, not thin. Two minutes per side is ridiculous. Who are these chefs anyway? Lucy S.6/25/20212 mins for pork meat to cook is definitely a no for me. It's not like beef that you can eat rarely, done, well done? Pork needs time to cook very well as far as I know if don't want to get ill.RosLondon, UK6/25/2021The key is \u201cthin cut.\u201d Please specify an actual thickness! I haven\u2019t made these yet because 2min per side is obviously way too little for a normal cut but how thin is thin? I left 3stars only because the site requires a measure, but that 3 stars is for the recipe not the result.  Amy BoggsSan Francisco, CA6/24/2021Delicious sauce! Definitely made more than needed for our pork chops. How long does it keep (refrigerator and freezer)?
