Enough said.By Alex DelanyFebruary 5, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailThere\u2019s always an exception to the rule. You know, that one thing that makes you question the truths and ideals that you hold dear. For me, that exception is bucatini, the greatest long pasta there ever was or will be.I am a short pasta person. I believe that short noodles are significantly better than long noodles. Orecchiette. Campanelle. Rigatoni. Gemelli. I like my pasta stab-able and welcoming to chunks of meat and vegetables, and those shapes feel like family. Which is why bucatini presents a serious problem: because even though it\u2019s a long pasta, I hold it in the same regard as I do these short shapes. It makes me question the very ground I walk on.How did this happen? How did bucatini get here, in such fine company? Well, let\u2019s start with bucatini\u2019s shape. To the untrained eye, it might get mistaken for spaghetti, but upon further inspection, you\u2019ll notice it\u2019s a bit thicker. And upon even further inspection, you\u2019ll notice that, what!? There\u2019s a little baby hole that runs all the way through the noodle?! Wow. That\u2019s adorable.And that hollow center is what makes bucatini so fantastic. Where spaghetti or linguine get coated with sauce, bucatini gets coated and filled with sauce. It\u2019s the ultimate delivery vehicle for velvety pasta sauces like cacio e pepe or carbonara. That hollow center gives you more sauce with each bite, and around here, we subscribe to the \u201cMore Sauce, More Life\u201d lifestyle.Carbonara was made for bucatini...probably.\nTed CavanaughBut here\u2019s the real secret to this pasta\u2019s success: Bucatini is fun to eat. That\u2019s what it comes down to. You can talk about the architectural benefits of different pasta shapes all you want, but if pasta doesn\u2019t make you think, \u201cLOL PASTA JEEZ, I LOVE YOU, AND I LOVE MY LIFE WHEN I\u2019M EATING YOU, REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE KIDS, AND I ALSO LOVED YOU THEN?\u201d what\u2019s the point? Bucatini provides that joy tenfold. Spaghetti is one-dimensional, but its hollow counterpoint is a delight, providing a mix of sauce, dense carbohydrates, and air pockets that make funny noises when you slurp them.Bucatini is a lesson in the foolishness of dogma, a case against absolute commitment to an ideal. I am a short pasta person. But I\u2019m willing to make exceptions. Bucatini has taught me about flexibility and acceptance. Thanks, bucatini. Love you.Let bucatini into your life...or...bowl:Bucatini with Butter-Roasted Tomato SauceBecause you need more butter-roasted things in your life.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyPastaRecipes you want to make.
