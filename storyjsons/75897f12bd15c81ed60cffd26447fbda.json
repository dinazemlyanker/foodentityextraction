Take advantage of the monochromatic monotony of winter and turn whatever is available into a chic and crunchy shaved winter salad. Even the creamy, tangy dressing fits the pale vibes\u2014but without sacrificing flavor.Ingredients4 servings\u00belb. mixed winter white vegetables (such as cauliflower, fennel bulbs, daikon radishes, and/or turnips)2white endive, leaves separated1Asian pear or firm Bosc pear, halved lengthwise, cored, thinly sliced3oz.

Cut out core of cauliflower (if using). Thinly slice vegetables crosswise about \u00bc\" thick.Step 2Toss vegetables, endive, pear, and cheese in a large bowl. Add oil and 1 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice; season with sea salt and pepper. Using your hands, toss salad until well coated. Chill (uncovered is fine) while you prepare the dressing.Step 3Whisk yogurt, mayonnaise, garlic, lemon zest, and remaining 2 Tbsp. lemon juice in a small bowl; season with kosher salt.Step 4Arrange about one-quarter of salad on a large platter. Drizzle some dressing over, letting it fall into the nooks and crannies of the vegetables. Add another one-quarter of salad; drizzle with dressing in same manner. Repeat with remaining salad and dressing. Season with kosher salt and pepper.Step 5Do Ahead: Dressing can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Vegetables can be sliced 1 day ahead. Wrap in wet paper towels, place in a resealable bag, and chill.How would you rate Winter White Salad?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (3)Back to TopTriangleI made this for an NYE dinner with steak au poivre and fondant potatoes and it was an excellent complement to a festive dinner. I halved the recipe, subbed blue cheese for the Piave, and used cauliflower as the winter white veg. The dressing is exceptional! It's great as-is for a more elevated dinner, but to make it weeknight-friendly in the future I'll likely simplify by making the dressing with a pile of mandolined cauliflower and sliced almonds or other things I more typically have on hand. LauraPhiladelphia1/3/2021This salad is very satisfying. The dressing is simple yet elegant and packs a nice punch. I have modified it before for my in-laws, who are barely accustomed to eating garlic at all, by adding some garlic powder. Worked great. I have made this salad 4 times now and its always great. Hail Molly.josiesappWY5/11/2020Such a unique recipe that feels refreshing and comforting at the same time. Would be beautiful at a dinner party too. Made just a few modifications here such as adding small white beans and replacing piave with blue cheese.
