He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.As much as we all talk about cooking with seasonal ingredients, sometimes you just want a recipe you can make whenever, wherever. Sometimes you just want broccoli bolognese.Kinda ugly but extremely delicious, it\u2019s a dish that requires little more than a head of grocery-store broccoli, a couple of sweet Italian sausages, and a box of pasta.The magic lies in how it all comes together. You blanch then chop the broccoli, essentially getting the bits the same size as the crumbled sausage you\u2019ve got browning in a large saut\u00e9 pan.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!When you combine the two, you add a cup of salty, starchy pasta water to form the base of your sauce. But how do you get it to be all... bolognese-ish?A potato masher.That\u2019s probably the one definitive takeaway you can glean from Molly Baz and me in the recipe\u2019s video. As the broccoli and sausage simmer in the bubbling water, a masher incorporates the two ingredients, kind of making them one, a process that reaches its fruition with the addition of butter and a shower of finely grated parm.As Molly skeptically points out in our video, it\u2019s not really a bolognese in the traditional sense.But I like to think that broccoli bolognese\u2014or \u201cbroc bolo\u201d in Molly speak\u2014just sounds good. Almost as good as it tastes.Get the recipe:Broccoli Bolognese with OrecchietteBroccoli and sausage pair up for an indulgent veg-heavy pasta dinner.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterRead MorecookingWho Needs Fancy Pasta When You Have D.I.Y.
