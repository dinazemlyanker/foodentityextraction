See our past recommendations here!According to the packaging, Fatafat is an \u201cAyurvedic digestive pill.\u201d So technically, it\u2019s health food. But as me and all the other Indian kids who grew up sneaking packets out of the pantry after dinner know, Fatafat is basically candy. Round, soft, chewy black orbs made of salt, sugar, cumin, amchur (mango powder), and ajwain (carom seeds) that happen to aid in digestion. Digestive snacks, or churan, are a whole category in India, and I can\u2019t think of anything else that packs so much umami in a single package.Fatafat has the I-can\u2019t-stop-eating-these quality of Reese\u2019s Pieces, the electrifying tang of Sour Patch Kids, and the salt-sugar ratio of Chewy SweeTARTS. Plus, it really does help settle your stomach! Fatafat was in such high demand in my house growing up that my older sister tricked me into thinking Fatafat was actually just little pieces of poop (to be fair, that\u2019s what it looks like) so she could hog our limited stash. Only Indians would be so bold as to make candy and label it as medicine, and my acid reflux and I are forever here for it. \u2014Priya Krishna, contributing writerBuy it: Fatafat Ayurvedic Digestive Pills, $10 for 10 13 oz packs.All products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
