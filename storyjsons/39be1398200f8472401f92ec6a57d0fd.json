If you sign up for our newsletter, you\u2019ll get her letter before everyone else.Here\u2019s a fun thing about my job: Every so often, I get to test recipes before they go live on our websites or into the pages of the magazine. It\u2019s standard practice at publications like Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious to have multiple editors cook through recipes before they are published to make sure they will work for, well, people like me: cooking enthusiasts who are not necessarily trained kitchen experts.The first time I volunteered, I was totally in my head about it, afraid I didn\u2019t have the chops to be useful and that I was wasting our food team\u2019s time. But now I like to take on a recipe once a month or so, especially when it sounds particularly delicious (most do!) or will push me to try something new. For example, I don\u2019t fry a lot of things at home, so it was fun to test these leek latkes from our holiday issue\u2014though my first batch somehow took me twice as long as it should have, confusing both me and the editor\u2014and it was even more fun to eat the leftovers with fried eggs for breakfast the next day.Want this letter before it hits the website?\u00a0Sign up for our newsletter!Anyway, as I test new recipes this week, I\u2019ve really been thinking about access to ingredients. I used to be able to take a train five stops to get fresh curry leaves or a specific kind of green chile, and now, more often than not, I\u2019m finding a substitution or ordering them online. I\u2019m aware of the privilege I started with\u2014to have lived in such close proximity to specialty grocery stores in the first place, to be able to order what I\u2019m looking for online and pay to get it delivered\u2014and this pandemic is definitely making me more conscious of what I am buying and how I will use it all. Like when I inevitably make this pumpkin-tahini mousse pie, I will use leftover pumpkin for this spiced chocolate-pumpkin cake and leftover tahini in swirly loaf cakes and brownies.Tahini + chocolate = winning combo.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Styling by Sue LiI\u2019m curious to hear how you go about deciding whether or not to buy an ingredient you haven\u2019t cooked with before when you see it in a recipe. Will you always do it if you can find it in your local grocery store? Will you only do it if you know you won\u2019t have half a jar left? Are you game to try anything that sounds intriguing?\u00a0And as I think about our ingredients, it\u2019s difficult not to also think about what\u2019s happening in India, where farmers are protesting agriculture bills, marching to Delhi and burning fields to fight for a fair market (Oakland-based spice company Diaspora Co., which works with independent farms across India, has a good primer). Or here in the US, where restaurants were forced to adapt fast to pandemic realities and started selling and delivering groceries\u2014scrambling to make money without clarity or support\u2014and where a new report says a staggering 17 percent of restaurants have now closed and 58 percent expect continued layoffs or furloughs for the next three months.\u00a0This is a devastating time for our industry, and its impacts will be far-reaching and continue to affect us\u2014the diners and consumers\u2014as well as workers across the world. I\u2019m committing to support independent food businesses wherever I can and would also love to hear about the products and organizations you love and are supporting this year.
