She\u2019s a hero.By Marnie HanelJune 6, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie CraigFacebookTwitterEmailThis is part of our series that celebrates America\u2019s Favorite Neighborhood Restaurants. We asked 80 of the most interesting people we know to reveal the local spots they love the most.On Portland, Oregon\u2019s de facto restaurant row, SE Division Street, Reel M Inn is an unchangeable dive bar serving Rainier tallboys and bewilderingly excellent (organic, even) fried chicken to off-shift chefs, old-timers, and newbies alike. Bartender turned owner Carey Bolton, who runs the bar by herself on its busiest nights, details its longstanding magic:Bartending is about customer service. In that sense, Portland is tough. A lot of places you walk in and you get a cold shoulder. There\u2019s a lot of \u201cUgh. I gotta serve you?\u201d And the Reel, as rusty and salty as we are, we\u2019re a pretty welcoming community. It\u2019s \u201cHey grab a stool. It\u2019s gonna be two hours so make friends with your neighbor.\u201dPhoto by Chelsie CraigWe have a pretty simple model: We do chicken well, we pour deep shots, we have ice-cold beer, and there\u2019s no place cheaper in town. We use organic chicken because it\u2019s good, and it\u2019s right. I would be hung if we did it any differently.You\u2019ve got a team of regulars who are your bouncers. They take care of anything and everything that might come up. Someone, God forbid, is causing drama? They\u2019ll take care of it for you. If somebody is sick, they\u2019ll take care of it.Photo by Chelsie CraigThe regs know the place better than I do. They\u2019re reliable. You just know that Gordie is going to show up between 4:30 and 5:30 and he\u2019s going to have two PBRs and possibly a Jack Daniels, if his wife will let him, maybe not, and he\u2019s gone by 7:30 on the nose. You can set your watch by it. Our trash guys went to Hosford School, a couple of streets away. They\u2019re probably pushing 60, if not 65. You know, yellow mustaches from smoking. They\u2019re like, \u201cMan, I\u2019ve been coming here for 150 years.\u201d And you don\u2019t doubt it.Photo by Chelsie CraigI don\u2019t think you expect a lady when you walk through the door. (We have all lady bartenders and one dude, Ronnie.) It\u2019s a badass move to be able to handle a bar on your own. No slight on Ronnie, but generally women are better multitaskers when it comes to...I have six drink orders in my head, I\u2019ve got a bucket that\u2019s down, I need to drop thighs in 30 seconds, I have a 30-second window to do that, I have the dishwasher running, and I\u2019ve gotta go change my soda and grab two bottles of Jameson. And that\u2019s in all of 12 seconds. If you can work at the Reel solo, you can do anything in life.Marnie Hanel is a writer in Portland and co-author of The Campout Cookbook.ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Explore Bon App\u00e9titNeighborhood RestaurantsRead MoresponsoredLibation Lessons: Expert Bartenders Share Their Secret IngredientsBy Bombay SapphirecultureEvery Bartender's Latest Obsession Is AmaroBy Brad Thomas ParsonscultureEverything I Know About Bartending, I Learned from My Korean MotherBy Ed Marszewski Recipes you want to make.
