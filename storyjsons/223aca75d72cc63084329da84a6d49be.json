Like most books from the publisher, what at first appears to be a heavy, linen-wrapped coffee table book is much more. Every recipe, and the opening of every chapter, packs in the folklore and cultural background for each dish. It\u2019s a remarkable feat of scholarship, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a boring textbook. Da\u011fdeviren\u2019s way of writing (short, descriptive, to the point) makes it riveting. I found myself reading through the 512 pages for hours, as if it were a novel.Photo by Chelsie CraigDa\u011fdeviren was the perfect candidate for the book. He rose to fame in the late \u201980s, first with a kebab joint in Istanbul and then \u00c7iya Sofrasi, a world-renowned restaurant that features dishes from every region of Turkey, prepared traditionally. Before opening, Da\u011fdeviren had traveled across the country, cooking with elders and grandmothers, preparing to write a book, when the restaurant opportunity came instead. In an episode of Chef\u2019s Table about his work, which now includes teaching high school students about Turkish cuisine and leading a food research foundation, you hear all about Da\u011fdeviren\u2019s political awakening (he led a campaign to unionize bakers) but his food is often whisked away or tucked into a blazing wood-fired oven. With The Turkish Cookbook, Da\u011fgdeviren completes what he set out to do, putting the food, the cultural context, and people who make it in focus.Photo by Chelsie CraigTake, for example, the soup chapter which opens with a note on cooking technique, an explanation of tarhana (a fermented hulled wheat and yogurt ingredient that\u2019s added to soups), and a poignant mini-essay on soup \u201cas social memory.\u201d \u201cIt announces and facilitates our joy, grief, pain, and lives,\u201d writes Da\u011fdeviren, listing soups designated for festivals, weddings, illness, and mourning. The recipes that follow suddenly represent more than a bowl of something hot when the weather\u2019s cold. A portion of Nohut \u00c7orbas\u0131, a chickpea soup, is poured over dry fields during times of drought in hope for rain; a lamb\u2019s brain soup is believed to help ease anxiety and support memory; a head and trotter soup is made for a family in mourning, to be distributed to seven neighbors and the poor to help the soul of the recently deceased comfortably pass on. When\u2019s the last time I cooked something, other than a birthday cake, that meant something deeper?Photo by Chelsie CraigThe dishes revolving around marriage I also found intriguing\u2014as well as far cries from the kinds of traditions I\u2019ve taken part in (like rehearsal dinners in windowless rooms with soggy Caesar salad). In Veiled Rice Pilaf, a wedding banquet dish, \u201cpine nuts represent the groom, the almonds the bride, the currants the children, and the pastry the home. The rice is believed to bring prosperity.\u201d A pistachio cordial drink is made for a prospective groom when visiting his bride\u2019s house. \u201cOffered after the salty coffee, it represents the change from salty to sweet and ends the visit on a good note.\u201d Many dishes are \u201clitmus tests\u201d for brides to be, such as onions stuffed with veal tomato, bulgar, and chili flakes, made in four versions (spicy, sweet, salty, and sour) to \u201csymbolize the balancing act of marriage.\u201d Meatballs stuffed with walnut-stuffed apricots (makiyan) are \u201cmade on the last day a new bride spends with her parents in the hope that her new home will enjoy good health, happiness, and fortune.\u201d There aren\u2019t so many tests for grooms, sadly, but there is a recipe for scrambled eggs with vegetables beloved by bachelors and college students.Photo by Chelsie CraigPhoto by Chelsie CraigI\u2019m not exaggerating when I say I spent hours reading it. The book feels like a collection of super-short stories that interconnect and echo each other, yet always end with a delicious plate of something. But that\u2019s not to suggest that the more than 500 recipes included are an afterthought. Many are very cookable and calling to me. I flagged a baked fish with tahini sauce, an almond tzatziki, and lamb meatballs with walnut rice.Da\u011fdeviren has pulled off a work of literary art and culinary history, which would sound sort of pompous if it weren\u2019t true. I promise it\u2019s true. It\u2019s not every day you come across a cookbook that transports you so deeply away from your world and into another, and for those from across the expanse of Turkey\u2014takes you home.Buy it: The Turkish Cookbook, $32 on AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
