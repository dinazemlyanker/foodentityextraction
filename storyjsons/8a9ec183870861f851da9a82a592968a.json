Because I LOVE WINGS. My favorite preflight meal is Buffalo Wild Wings. So with the return of Big 10 football this weekend, my home will transform into the sports bar of 2020, better than any other sports bar because it\u2019s just me and my pod and my cat. We have a clean bathroom. And a great beer selection.Back to the wings. Bon App\u00e9tit has many recipes for them. Some are more complicated than others. I\u2019ve been practicing, and I took notes, so that we can figure out which wings YOU should make. Go Blue!You want to be true to the experience, you purist youTo re-create bar-style Buffalo wings, what you really need to do is deep-fry them in the grease of 1,000 wings past. I don\u2019t do that at home because of the amount of oil required and my general laziness. But if you MUST, this recipe is the truest expression of those wings you so desire. Super-crispy skin, drenched in sauce, an absolutely delicious mess.BA's Best Buffalo WingsView RecipeYou want Buffalo wings but don\u2019t want to fry themWhy go to the trouble of deep-frying when the wings get sogged in sauce anyway? When you bake them you can achieve a pretty damn crispy skin and no one will be the wiser once they\u2019re smothered in ranch that\u2019s all over your face and couch cushions. Steam cleaner\u2019s coming next week, don\u2019t worry about it.\u00a0NOTE ON THIS RECIPE: Some commenters do NOT like the brown sugar in the Buffalo sauce, which is \u201cuntraditional\u201d and \u201cblasphemous\u201d depending on your wing religion. I made them with the sugar and have to agree: not necessary.

If you want.Grilled Chicken Wings with Shishito Peppers and HerbsSteady medium heat is best for grilling wings; they need time for the fat to render and the skin to crisp.View RecipeYou want crispy wings but don\u2019t like them \u201cwet\u201dSorry, not sure how else to say it. But after some time in the boiler, these peppercorn wings get a texture \u00a0I\u2019d compare to a salt-and-pepper-flavored kettle chip. The recipe\u2019s also super flexible\u2014play with whatever spices you have around the house, as long as you go HARD on the pepper for those crunchy bits.Crispy Peppercorn Chicken WingsThese super-flavorful, no-fry chicken wings turn out best when they\u2019re seasoned ahead of time. You can do this as little as 1 hour in advance, but letting them hang out with salt and those spices overnight is a complete game changer.View RecipeYou want a sweet, glaze-y wingWithin this recipe there\u2019s a traditional Buffalo sauce and the option of a simple glaze with ginger, honey, garlic, and soy sauce.

The wings get covered in spices and a ginger-garlic oil and sit for 30 min-to a full day to season them deeply. THEN you bake them starting from a cold oven, which makes the chicken fat slowly drip off into the pan (which you can save and use later) and leaves you with super-crispy skin. It\u2019s a bit of a process but with restaurant-worthy results.

I haven\u2019t made these because there\u2019s frying involved, but there\u2019s also a fish sauce and crab paste caramel for glazing the wings. So I\u2019m thinking maybe I\u2019ll make THAT and then bake the wings to be more user-friendly. I\u2019ll report back soon.\u00a0Crab Fat\u2013Caramel WingsThe funky flavor in these mind-altering chicken wings comes from a jarred condiment that\u2019s pretty easy to find at Asian markets.View RecipeSee you on the sidelines!Explore Bon App\u00e9titChicken WingRecipes you want to make.
