A lot of tools can bring dull blades back to life, but professional chefs and experts agree that the best knife sharpener is a whetstone. That\u2019s because every time you sharpen a knife, you remove metal from its edge, wearing away at your precious blade. Depending on the tool you use, it can be easy to take off too much. A whetstone offers the most gentle, gradual solution and gives you the most control. Plus, it\u2019ll work on almost any kind of kitchen knife and different types of cutlery, including chef\u2019s knives, paring knives, cleavers, and pocket knives.While you can pay a professional to sharpen knives for you, they are likely to remove more from the cutting edge than you would at home (like a haircut versus a trim). Sending your knives away too often can actually decrease their lifespan, so if you want to get them professionally sharpened, do it once a year max. And, in the meantime, check out our favorite tools for sharpening (and honing) knives.Okay, but what is a whetstone and why is it the best knife sharpener?A whetstone, a.k.a knife sharpening stone, is a rectangular stone block that sharpens a knife\u2019s blade as it is pulled across the stone\u2019s surface. Whetstones come in two forms: Natural and synthetic. Synthetic whetstones are typically made of silicon carbide or aluminum oxide as opposed to real stone, or they may be coated with a fine layer of diamond particles. Synthetic stones are manufactured to have consistent density and grit size, which makes them more efficient and easier to use. You\u2019ll find that many have two sides\u2014one with coarse grit and one with fine grit\u2014like this one from Japanese knife maker Mitsumoto Sakari. If you prefer natural, test kitchen director Chris Morocco likes this Zwilling J.A. Henckels sharpening stone because unlike some waterstones which need to be submerged prior to use, it just requires a splash of water.Using a whetstone gives you control over the angle of the blade and the pressure that\u2019s placed on the blade\u2014something that isn\u2019t true with manual pull-through and electric knife sharpeners. You also won\u2019t find a sharpener that works on as many types of knives.Mitsumoto Sakari Japanese Knife Sharpening Stone$40 at AmazonZwilling 250/1000 Combination Japanese Water Stone$113 $90 at Zwilling$113 $90 at Sur La TableGot it. Now how do I use it?To use a whetstone, soak the stone if the directions call for it and place it on top of a nonslip surface, coarse-side up if it\u2019s double-sided. Place your knife on the end of the stone (facing away from you) and drag it toward the other end of the stone at about a 15- to 20-degree angle gently across its surface. Repeat this process for both sides of the blade until enough metal is removed and you notice a burr, or slight raise of metal. At this point, your knife will be sharp and you can turn the whetstone fine-side up and run your blade over it for touch-ups to smooth and polish the edges\u2014this will remove the burr. If you\u2019re not confident that you can nail the angle yourself, some companies sell sharpening guide rails to ensure you get it right. Yes, the sharpening process with a whetstone takes time and practice, but there are many YouTube videos that walk you through it.Non-Slip Silicone Placemats$11 at AmazonGlobal MinoSharp Guide Rails$23 at AmazonAfter you\u2019ve mastered the art of sharpening with your least precious knife, you\u2019ll feel more confident taking a prized blade to the whetstone as needed\u2014which is not that frequently. Most home cooks probably won\u2019t have to sharpen their knives more than two to four times a year.There\u2019s got to be an easier way. What are my other options?If \u201clearn to use a whetstone\u201d is nowhere on your to-do list, a manual pull-through sharpener is your best bet for attaining a razor-sharp knife. Just keep in mind that the angles on most pull-through sharpeners are already set\u2014you can\u2019t adjust it to the knife you\u2019re using, and you can\u2019t use the same machine to sharpen both Japanese knives and Western-style knives. It\u2019s also easy to remove more material than you intended and, over time, the mechanics in the sharpener can bend and break, leaving your knife with a really gnarly edge. To get the best results with this tool, check with the manufacturer to see if they sell a manual pull-through specifically for your brand of knife (for example, we\u2019ve had a great experience using the Miyabi 2-Stage Handheld Knife Sharpener with Miyabi knives) and, if not, ask them for a recommendation. Our friends at Epicurious love this universal KitchenIQ two-stage manual knife sharpener, which also works on serrated knives.Miyabi 2-stage Diamond/Ceramic Handheld Knife Sharpener$55 at Amazon$55 at ZwillingKitchenIQ 2-Stage Knife Sharpener$10 at AmazonThe fastest, most convenient route to getting a sharp blade is an electric sharpener, but it\u2019s important to note that they also aren't adjustable and they provide even less control than manual pull-throughs. So if you\u2019ve got a really nice, high-quality knife that you want to last forever, this sharpening system is not the best choice. \u201cIf you have decent knives, using an electric sharpener is like brushing your teeth with a chainsaw,\u201d Morocco says. \u201cSure, it will work, but eventually you won\u2019t have any teeth.\u201dBut if you\u2019ve got a great-but-cheap knife, like the Victorinox Fibrox Pro Chef\u2019s Knife (which Morocco believes is one of the best knives for your money), then an electric sharpener will get the job done. He says, \u201cAn electric kitchen knife sharpener is better than only ever having dull knives in your knife block, but it isn\u2019t very kind to your blades and won\u2019t be able to accommodate any unique nuances to that blade.\u201dChef'sChoice Professional Electric Knife Sharpener$135 at AmazonWork Sharp E2 Kitchen Knife Sharpener$50 at AmazonWhat\u2019s the difference between knife sharpeners and honing rods?While sharpening your knives removes metal to create a new, sharper edge, honing helps to maintain that sharp edge. Use your honing rod (or honing steel) between sharpening sessions, whenever you find yourself meeting resistance as you dice things like tomatoes or plums. If honing doesn\u2019t do the trick, it\u2019s time to sharpen your knife again. Morocco recommends using a ceramic honing rod. Ceramic rods are harder than stainless steel\u2014i.e., harder than your knife\u2014and they have a finer grit, which works faster and is less rough on your knife edge.
