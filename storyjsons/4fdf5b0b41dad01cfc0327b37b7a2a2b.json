It\u2019s comforting and flavorful, and when you get a taste of the fresh stuff, it\u2019s clear how this genre of Latin cuisine came to be one of world\u2019s greatest culinary joys.By Princess CruisesOctober 31, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailWhen you think about Mexican food, you inevitably think about salsa. Its versatility and variety are unbeatable. Dip it, pour it, and put it on everything: quesadillas, taquitos, tacos, roasted fish, scrambled eggs, even sweet potatoes! When you choose the Bon App\u00e9tit Recommended: Salsa & Salsa (Dance & Dine) on Princess Cruises, you\u2019ll become well acquainted with this cover-it-all condiment. Before you pack your bags to Mexico, here are a few of our favorite salsa combos.Salsa Frescapair with taquitos & the Mayan Heat cocktailSalsa fresca is traditionally tomato-based, and this one gets its deep flavor from first roasting the tomatoes, onion, garlic, and jalape\u00f1o. White wine vinegar brings added acidity, while chipotle peppers in adobo sauce lend a kick of heat. The whole thing is blended for a smooth finish. Topped over taquitos, it\u2019s the perfect combination of crunch, flavor, and spice. Wash it down with the Mayan Heat cocktail, which marries tequila, triple sec, lime juice, and agave to complement this yummy combo. You can even try these both on board a Princess Cruise!Corn Salsapairs best with tacos and cotija cheeseCrunchy corn, juicy tomatoes, crisp red onion, jalape\u00f1os, chilis, and cilantro make up this simple salsa. It goes with everything, but we think it\u2019s optimal spread over warm, just-arranged taco filling, whether it\u2019s an all-veg affair or a carnitas cure-all. The trick to the perfect consistency? Once you\u2019ve charred the corn on the cob, let it cool, scrape off the kernels, and mash them with a potato masher or the back of a spoon. This allows the starches and juices to thicken the salsa.Pico de Gallopairs best with freshly grilled pork, chicken, or salmonFor the salsa purist out there (we know you exist), pico de gallo is the gold standard, the safe standby, and the most reliable of salsas. It\u2019s rarely too hot, it\u2019s flavorful, and once again, it goes with everything. We like it scooped over a freshly grilled fish, like salmon, but it also complements grilled chicken, pork, and steak. With fresh tomatoes, cilantro, \u00bd an onion, and a little bit of jalape\u00f1o, this straightforward salsa is easy to whip up with a moment\u2019s notice.Avocado-Tomatillo Salsa Verdepairs best with grilled shrimp quesadillaSalsa verde, the green cousin to its classic counterpart, may be more understated than the red-tomato variety, but when done right, it is no less mighty. Traditionally made with tomatillos, serrano chiles, garlic, and onion, it\u2019s like a zesty high five, bringing fresh, tangy flavor to grilled fish, salty pork, and cheesy shrimp quesadillas. The addition of avocado thickens the salsa, giving it a dreamy, creamy consistency.Charred Tomato Salsapairs best with a classic margarita, guacamole, and tortilla chipsIf you prefer a traditional salsa \u00e0 la your local Mexican restaurant\u2013\u2013you know, juicy, easy to scoop\u2013\u2013but are looking for a bit of extra bite, this is the one for you. This classic, blended tomato salsa gets its grilled flavor by first charring the tomatoes in a skillet on medium-high heat. Onion, garlic, serrano chiles, cilantro, and lime round out the flavors, making it the perfect sidekick to a timeless trifecta of crispy tortilla chips, guacamole, and a classic margarita.Hungry yet?
