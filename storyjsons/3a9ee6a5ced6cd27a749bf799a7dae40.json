Coarsely chop greens and remaining tender stems; set aside.Step 2Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high. Using your hands, grab small clumps of sausage (you\u2019re going for rustic meatballs about the size of a golf ball) and add to pot. Cook, turning each piece as it becomes crusty, until deeply golden brown all over, about 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer sausage to a plate, leaving fat behind. Remove pot from heat and reserve. If sausage has given off a lot of fat, tip some of it into a bowl; you want about 2 Tbsp. left in the pot (save the rest for another use\u2014like frying eggs).Step 3Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of generously salted boiling water, stirring occasionally, until just shy of al dente, about 1 minute less than package directions (it\u2019ll finish cooking in the sauce). Drain pasta, reserving 1\u00bd cups pasta cooking liquid.Step 4Set reserved pot with fat over medium-low heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring and scraping up any browned bits, until softened slightly, about 2 minutes. Add reserved broccoli rabe, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring, until greens are wilted and bright green, about 4 minutes. Return sausage to pot along with any juices on the plate. Break up sausage into smaller but still coarse pieces with a wooden spoon.Step 5Add butter, pasta, and \u00be cup pasta cooking liquid to pot. Cook, tossing often and adding more pasta cooking liquid a tablespoon or two at a time if needed, until pasta is coated in sauce, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat, add lemon zest and lemon juice, and toss to coat.Step 6Divide pasta among bowls and top with pistachios and Parmesan.Excerpted with permission from \u2018The Cook You Want to Be: Everyday Recipes to Impress\u2019 Copyright \u00a9 2022 by Andy Baraghani.
