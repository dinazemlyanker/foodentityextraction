We\u2019re all about the warm jammy fruit hiding inside this dessert. Covering the whole dish with foil keeps the bread from burning before the fruit cooks through, and weighing the entire thing down with a heavy skillet ensures that maximum syrupy fruit juices soak into the slices.Ingredients8 servings10Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more for pan\u00bdcup sugar1\u00bdtsp. ground cinnamon\u00bdtsp. ground cardamom (optional)Pinch of kosher salt2lb. apples, sliced, stone fruit, cut into thick wedges, blackberries, and/or blueberries1tsp. vanilla extract1loaf challah, brioche, or pullman, sliced \u00bd\" thick (you\u2019ll need 12\u201315)Maple syrup and vanilla ice cream (for serving)PreparationStep 1Place a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 350\u00b0. Butter a shallow 2-qt. baking dish. Mix sugar, cinnamon, cardamom, and salt in a small bowl. Toss fruit, vanilla, and \u00bc cup sugar mixture in a medium bowl; set aside.Step 2Spread 10 Tbsp. butter in a thin layer across each slice of bread, working butter all the way to the edges (you mighthave extra butter, depending on the size of your slices). Generously sprinkle remaining sugar mixture over buttered side of bread. Add any leftover sugar to reserved fruit. Fit about half of bread slices along bottom and up sides of prepared dish, placing sugared side down and overlapping slightly. Scatter reserved fruit over and top with remaining slices of bread, placing sugared side up and shingling to cover fruit. Place dish on a rimmed baking sheet and cover tightly with foil. Set a cast-iron skillet on top to weigh down; bake until juices are bubbling, 50\u201360 minutes.Step 3Carefully remove dish from oven; remove skillet and foil. Bake, uncovered, until golden brown, 10\u201315 minutes more. Let cool 20 minutes.Step 4Divide baked cinnamon toast among plates, top with a scoop of ice cream, and drizzle with maple syrup.Step 5Do Ahead: Dessert can be baked 1 day ahead. Let cool, then store tightly wrapped at room temperature. Reheat, uncovered, in a 300\u00b0 oven.How would you rate Baked Cinnamon Toast with Fruit?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (1)Back to TopTriangleThis is a delicious breakfast dish!  I used a purchased loaf of challah bread from Whole Foods bakery, sliced 3/4 loaf in half horizontally, rather than slices...added 1 pound sliced (unpeeled) peaches, 8 oz. each blueberries and blackberries.  Otherwise, followed recipe step by step, including weighing dish down w/ cast iron skillet.   \nYes ! I will make this dish again!
