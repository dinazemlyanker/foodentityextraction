He enjoyed her company and would propose years later, but that evening, long-standing plans took precedence. For 15 years, Hochman and six close friends have spent nearly every Tuesday gathered around a corner table at Pietro\u2019s Italian restaurant in midtown Manhattan. Several of them are second-generation customers at the family-run institution, which opened in 1932. Dozens of plaques with phrases like \u201cMeatball brothers\u201d and \u201cFry it well, son\u201d line the restaurant\u2019s walls, marking booths dedicated to the most loyal regulars. Hochman and his friends have a table by the bar with a plaque that reads: \u201cThe Tuesday Night Boys.\u201d Here, where they\u2019ve lingered to watch the Mets in extra innings and marked personal losses and triumphs, Hochman and his longtime friend Larry Zakarin explain what their tradition entails.Who are the Tuesday Night Boys?Larry: I grew up with a couple of the guys from 13 years old, and Jason\u2019s been my best friend since 19. We met at a keg party.Jason: It\u2019s unusual to have friendships that are that long.Larry: Probably one of the most unique things about it is that we have become friends with our friends\u2019 friends. We\u2019ve really intermingled our lives.Jason: We don\u2019t go outside of the circle.Larry: We\u2019ve had some guys fall in, we\u2019ve had some guys fall out. Once you come, you\u2019re always invited.Why did the group start, and why Tuesdays?Larry: The dinner really started because we wanted a guys\u2019 night out. When I got married, I wasn\u2019t seeing my friends a lot. We had to find a night that nobody cared about, that the wife didn\u2019t care about, a night that was kind of always free, and it ended up being Tuesday night.Why did you choose Pietro\u2019s?Larry: It was a special place. We would go out to nice restaurants, and we would spend a lot of money. The food and the service was always okay. When we came to this place, we got treated well.Jason: Consistency. The one word for the whole story is consistency. You have consistency in the restaurant, and you have consistency in the friendship. When you come to Pietro\u2019s for 15 years every Tuesday night, you feel like you\u2019re coming home.Come every Tuesday? Bring your own plaque.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanYou\u2019ve clearly become close with the people here.Larry: When I lost my dad about seven, eight years ago, I wasn\u2019t coming out on Tuesday nights as much. They all kind of harassed me to come. I came down here, we went to dinner, and [owner] Billy [Bruckman] Sr. found out what was going on. He came over to the table, gave me a hug, bought us all dinner. It was a good feeling. They care about us. They definitely do.Jason: I don\u2019t call for reservations. I text.Larry: We\u2019ve brought people from around the world here. When you come with clients, and you don\u2019t have a menu and you order for the table, and they bring out all the delicious food, people think you\u2019re Tony Soprano.What do you order?Larry: The order for Tuesday nights is usually chopped salad and Caesar salad, and everybody gets half-and-half on their plate. We get cottage fries that we order early because it takes 30 minutes to make them. Salami and cheese, always. And for dinner, we get chicken Pietro, which is Italian fried chicken. We get steak, medium, sliced; we get chicken Parmesan; we get shells a la nat [pasta swimming in a rich veal marrow sauce].Jason: We only do family-style.How did you get your names on the wall?Jason: I said, \u201cBilly, we\u2019ve been coming here long enough, I don\u2019t have a plaque on the wall.\u201d He said, \u201cYou make it, I\u2019ll put it up.\u201d That\u2019s exactly how it happened.Larry: That night was so great, putting it up. We\u2019re the youngest crew in the whole place. When we first started coming here, we would have to wait for a seat.Jason: I earned this table, babe.Eric Ginsburg is an independent journalist with a soft spot for chicken parm.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsItalian AmericanRed SauceNew York CityRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
