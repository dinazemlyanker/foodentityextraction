CNN\u2019s strong-jawed trauma neurosurgeon is searching for the secrets to a long life on his new show, Chasing Life, and this includes several hot baths. His second bath, called jikan-yu, happens to be a whopping 115 degrees (F), an illegal temperature in the U.S. (anything above 104, FYI.) He\u2019ll descend into the onsen (hot springs) for three minutes and hope for a rejuvenated bod by the end of it. The doctor looks at the steaming bath with dread and excitement.Chasing Life explores areas known as \u201cblue zones,\u201d where people have lived longer than the average lifespan. In Japan, which has the world\u2019s highest average life expectancy, Sanjay Gupta is treated by a blind acupuncturist; in India he gets an Ayurvedic oil massage administered by a guy\u2019s feet; and in Bolivia, he undergoes a grueling stress test at high altitude.By the end of just a few screeners, I wanted to get back into yoga and eat more bitter melon. I\u2019ve been off my game. What else could I do to live until I\u2019m 97 with a heart that\u2019s 20 years old, like the flirtatious dancer he meets in Okinawa? I had a quick chat with Dr. Gupta\u2014who was in between press interviews and reporting on the opioid epidemic for CNN\u2014to find out.I had a green smoothie, and I\u2019m feeling pretty on top of things so far today, but something tells me you\u2019ve done better.[I had] a Mediterranean sort of breakfast. I had some hummus, some tabbouleh as well, and some olives. My kids were doing heavy carb breakfasts, waffles and all that in the morning, and hitting the afternoon lull. Now we started doing more protein and more of a micronutrient-focused breakfast, and I feel great.What changed in your eating and exercise routine after filming?India was really interesting to me because of Ayurveda, and the food as medicine part really resonated with me. I mean literally Hippocrates said, \u201cLet food be thy medicine,\u201d but I don\u2019t think most doctors, or most people, really know what that means or how to implement it into their own lives. When the Ayurvedic diet was created, they looked at food and figured out what function the food had, and what types of food would be good with other types of foods. Everything was done with a sense of purpose, whereas in most of the world when you create a diet, it\u2019s usually based on palate\u2014what tastes good. Now I really do think about why I eat certain foods at certain times of the day, with much more focus on the micronutrients rather than the fat, carbs, and protein. I feel good. I feel really good.The other thing is, I\u2019ve always been sort of focused on fitness and trying to exercise every day. But whether it\u2019s losing weight or feeling more energized, I do think that the vast majority of that comes from diet as opposed to exercise.So there\u2019s lots of hummus and\u2026[My wife and I] add other things to our food now. I\u2019ve always loved turmeric, but the thing that fascinated me about turmeric was that it\u2019s fat-soluble. That means it dissolves in fat\u2014you have to eat it with food. In India, turmeric is just a part of the diet in every meal. They\u2019ll sprinkle it on rice. They\u2019ll put it in dal. They\u2019ll add it to the various sauces, sabzis, or whatever they\u2019re cooking. You\u2019re always getting it at a very high absorption rate.What are some things you\u2019d tell people to help them live longer, healthier, happier lives?Well, they\u2019re all connected: longer, happier, healthier lives. If you take Norway, for example, at the time the happiest country in the world\u2014it didn\u2019t make a lot of sense initially. They thought, we\u2019re going to be in a city that\u2019s 270 miles north of the Arctic Circle. They are plunged into darkness for months out of the year. But it was this notion that we really thrive as human beings by overcoming some sort of challenge on a regular basis. You could put yourself in a very beautiful setting that never changes, and you would have a certain level of happiness and maybe corresponding health, but [you need to be] challenging yourself in some way. For the people who live in Norway, [the challenge is] their environment. It wasn\u2019t that they were happy in spite of their environment; they were happy in many ways because of their environment. [In the episode, we meet a group of swimmers who plunge into the freezing sea for 30 seconds to a minute every morning.] You don\u2019t have to live in Norway to be happy, but what is something you\u2019re going to overcome in some way today?Then we were in Japan, and the mainland of Japan is considered one of the most stressed places in the world now. [On the show, he takes a \u201cforest bath,\u201d called shirin yuko, a hike through the forest.] It\u2019s one of these things where we know it feels good to be outside, in nature. We\u2019ve been hearing that our whole lives. But there are chemicals, called phytoncides, that basically protect nature against harmful attacks and stresses, and those phytoncides are released into the air and we have receptors for these phytoncides in our own bodies\u2014I found that intriguing. The aroma of the forest could potentially be very stress-relieving and work as an antidepressant.When you signed on to do this show, did the CNN producers and executives mention how often you were going to be shirtless?No. No, they didn\u2019t.Chasing Life debuts on CNN April 13, at 9 p.m. EST.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishCelebritiesTravelInterviewsRead MoreLifestyleHow to Eat for a Longer Life (There's Still Alcohol)By Rachel Sugar Recipes you want to make.
