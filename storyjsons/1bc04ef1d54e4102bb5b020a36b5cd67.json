At least, that was my \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d mentality when I strolled into chef Pierre Thiam\u2019s airy all-day caf\u00e9 Teranga in New York\u2019s Harlem neighborhood. I\u2019d been lured in by the array of fresh takes on classic West African staples: caramelized plantains, black-eyed peas salad, grilled chicken with a peanut Yassa sauce, and most of all jollof fonio. For his riff, Thiam switches out the rice, stewed in a rich, soul-warming tomato sauce, for the small West African supergrain fonio. On my first bite, I knew I had to rethink my theory. By the time I finished, I decided I had to track down Thiam to hear the secrets behind his recipe. Here, he explains every step of the process.The TomatoJollof isn\u2019t jollof without tomato, and Thiam\u2019s begins with a hearty dollop of fried paste. A crowning scoop of pure\u0301e ties the dish together, adding a hit of acid and tang.The SidesBowls come with any two of Thiam\u2019s five side options. We\u2019re particularly into the lime-ginger black-eyed-pea salad and the Ghanaian kelewele: spicy caramelized plantains.The BaseJollof is a one-pot dish almost always anchored by rice, but Thiam\u2019s version uses fonio, a fluffy quinoa-like grain he grew up eating in Senegal. He sources his from a women-led farming collective in Ke\u0301dougou called the Koba Club.The CondimentsWest Africans love to debate which regional style of jollof is best, so Thiam\u2019s sauces cross the map: pico de gallo from Co\u0302te d\u2019Ivoire, Ghanaian shito, Nigerian Scotch bonnet paste, and this garlicky Senegalese rof, which pairs perfectly with spiced roast salmon.The Special IngredientInstead of meat, Thiam adds ground fermented locust beans (which are actually seeds!) to the stock he uses to cook the fonio for a funky but vegetarian-friendly punch.Explore Bon App\u00e9titWest AfricanRestaurantsNew YorkRead MorecultureThis Dive Bar Is Turning Out the Best Burger in OaklandBy Julia KramerrestaurantsTurkey Tails Are The Most Delicious Thing You Didn\u2019t Even Know You Could EatBy Elyse InaminecultureThe Senegalese Chef Behind America\u2019s New Favorite SupergrainBy Elazar SontagRecipes you want to make.
