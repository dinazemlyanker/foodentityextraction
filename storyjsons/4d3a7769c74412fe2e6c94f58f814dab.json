Maricela Vega, the chef at Atlanta restaurant 8ARM and founder of Chicomec\u00f3atl, an organization centering the foodways of Indigenous Mexican diaspora, likes to confit them in oil, a simple technique that creates fatty-rich full-on flavor. Garlic, leeks, and chives are all you need to make this savory infused oil, great on its own or as a base for just about any sauce or dressing\u2014including this pumpkin hot sauce.IngredientsMakes about 4\u00bd cups1large bunch of chives, coarsely chopped (about \u00bd cup)1large leek, white and pale green parts only, coarsely chopped1\u00bdcups coarsely chopped green garlic or whole garlic cloves4cups vegetable oilPreparationStep 1Bring chives, leek, green garlic, and oil to a simmer in a large saucepan over medium heat (this will take some time\u2014be patient!) and cook 2 minutes.
