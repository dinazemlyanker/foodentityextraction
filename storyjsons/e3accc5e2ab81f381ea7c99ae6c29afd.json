Remove the pizza dough from the refrigerator and set on the counter to bring the dough to room temperature.While the pizza dough comes to room temperature, cut the squash in half lengthwise and use a spoon to scoop out the seeds. Then cut each piece of squash crosswise into \u00bc-inch half moons. Cut the root ends off of the onion and slice the onion crosswise into \u00bc-inch thick rings. Remove the outer peel from each ring and discard. Peel and finely grate the garlic on a microplane.On a rimmed baking sheet, toss the cut onions and acorn squash with 2 tablespoons of oil. Season with salt and pepper. Roast until knife tender, about 15 minutes.While the onions and squash roast, heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a small skillet, until shimmering. Add the grated garlic and a large pinch of red pepper flakes. Stir to incorporate, then immediately pour the oil into a small heatproof bowl. The garlic will keep cooking from the residual heat of the oil.Grate the cheese on the large holes of a box grater.When the onions and squash are cooked, scrape the vegetables onto the cutting board.Drizzle the baking sheet with oil and brush to spread. Using your hands, stretch out the pizza dough to fit the pan. Bake until dry and lightly golden (to prevent the crust from being soggy), about 8 minutes.Remove the pan from the oven and brush the dough all over with the garlic-chili oil. Using an offset spatula, spread the Campbell's\u00ae Cream of Chicken Soup over the crust, leaving a \u00bd-inch border. Scatter the squash, onions, and soppressata on top and sprinkle with the remaining cheese.Bake until cheese is bubbly and golden, about 12 to 15 minutes. Slice and sprinkle with chili flakes.Recipe by Campbell'sRelated VideoCreamy White Pizza with Squash and SopressataReviews SectionReviewsWrite a review\u2026GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for the Bon App\u00e9titNewsletterSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyExplore Bon App\u00e9titCampbell'sSponsoredBasicallyMore from Bon App\u00e9titRecipes6 Pro Chefs Reveal Their \"Secret Weapon\" Ingredients2022-03-02T17:00:00.000ZrecipePorcini Gnocchi With Butter Sauce2022-03-15T09:00:00.000ZrecipeWhiskey Sour2020-12-16T18:20:00.000ZBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
