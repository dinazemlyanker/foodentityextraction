Pro tip: If you sign up for the Healthyish newsletter, you\u2019ll get the scoop before everyone else.Dear Healthyish friends,I\u2019ve been spending all of my free time these days picking fruit, chopping hardwood trees for wood, digging for fossils, and catching a lot of sea bass. Yes, I\u2019m talking about Animal Crossing: New Horizons, the video game everyone else began collectively obsessing over a full year ago in the early days of quarantine. (If that makes me sound behind on the times, I should mention that I still haven\u2019t seen a single episode of The Wire; I am nothing if not consistent.)For the four other people who don\u2019t already know the premise of the game, it\u2019s simple (it has to be as it is literally a children\u2019s game. I have no shame). You are the overlord of a private island that you can make into your very own utopia. You share your island with a band of adorable little animal villagers who give you presents and teach you how to make items like butter churns and garden benches. You get a house to decorate and fill with cute objects like petite popcorn machines and teeny-tiny incense burners. You can try your hand at playing the \u201cStalk Market\u201d and potentially make a fortune selling turnips in exchange for the local currency, Bells, which you can then use to buy more popcorn machines and incense burners. But for the most part, the bulk of your time playing the game is spent doing mundane chores, like picking weeds, collecting wood, catching fish and bugs, to sell for Bells, and farming resources, like stones and iron, to make tools and furniture. The point, I think, is for it to be relaxing.When I first started playing a few weeks ago, I quickly noticed a pattern in my game play: I would race through my laundry list of chores at breakneck speed, trying to juggle multiple tasks and running around everywhere (and trampling so many flowers in the process) as if someone was timing just how quickly I could harvest those coconuts. The irony that I felt stressed out by a video game whose entire premise is that I\u2019m supposed to create a paradise for slowing down and chilling out was...not lost on me.This fear that I\u2019m constantly running out of time has followed me for a long time, but only after writing my last newsletter about the relationship between cooking and my anxiety have I started to ask myself why I feel the need to rush through life all the time. What is it that I have to get to that makes the tasks of day-to-day living feel so urgent? What, after all, is the big rush?The non-spoiler spoiler alert here is, of course, that there\u2019s nothing so important waiting for me on the other side of all my chores (in-game and IRL) that I need to race toward it like the Road Runner. If only it were so easy to simply recognize this and move on. But that\u2019s not how unlearning works. It\u2019s a constant practice to have to remember to slow down and just b-r-e-a-t-h-e, regardless of whether I\u2019m catching boatloads of pixelated fish in the game or trying to meal prep a week\u2019s worth of food in an afternoon. When I inevitably find myself on the hamster wheel again, I\u2019m slowly learning to come back to the same question: What\u2019s the big rush?Yours in slowness,Christina ChaeyAssociate editorWhat I\u2019m Cooking This Week:Photo by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Yekaterina BoytsovaFrench-ish Onion SoupVegetarian RamenSquash and Caramelized Onion TartBraised Chicken and Spinach Soup with Pita ChipsOlive Oil Galette With Spicy GreensHeartbeet Chocolate CakeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletterSelf CareessayRead MoreLifestyleWhy I\u2019m Trying to Cook Less in 2021By Christina ChaeyRecipes you want to make.
