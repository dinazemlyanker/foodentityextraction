Now he\u2019s cooking ribs for 400 people.By Dave Grohl, as told to Adam RapoportMay 29, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Harry EelmanFacebookTwitterEmailWhen I was in Nirvana and Nevermind came out, all of a sudden I was making a ton of money, which was something I never had. So I bought a beach house in Nags Head, NC, and spent the entire summer of \u201992 there, eating Carolina pulled pork from this tiny shack. I would get a pint and eat it until it ran out, then I would get another pint until it ran out\u2014just pulled pork on a white bun with slaw, and that was it. I realized, Oh, this is barbecue: so simple, but sublime and complex.I broke my leg falling off the stage during a Foo Fighters show four years ago. When I got off tour, I had nothing to do but mess around with a Big Green Egg that our bassist Nate got me. I went on YouTube and watched some guy. The first thing I tried was ribs because that\u2019s what\u2019s on the Chili\u2019s commercials. I got the dry rub, hit them with smoke, and served them to my kids. They loved it. Everyone only got like two ribs so I said, I'm doing this again tomorrow! I was hooked.Most musicians are obsessive compulsive weirdos, whether it\u2019s the instrument that they play, or an arrangement, or composition. You\u2019re always trying to one up the thing you\u2019ve just done, or perfect it, or get to the place where you\u2019re playing your instrument but you\u2019re not actually thinking about it. It\u2019s kind of the same with food. The parallels are insane.Grohl making barbecue in a parking lot.\nPhoto by Harry EelmanAfter a few months, I was hosting parties for 50 to 75 people. The Egg was no longer big enough, so I got a cabinet smoker, then a Lang trailer rig from Georgia. I was doing brisket and pork butt. At this point, friends were saying, \u201cDave, this is really good\u2014you should open a restaurant!\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t know, that kinda sounds like a job.\u201dWhat really got me cooking for a crowd were the Malibu fires. I wanted to cook for everyone who was displaced. I ended up barbecuing hundreds of pounds of meat and bringing care packages to the fire stations, just to say thank you. Those guys were heroes.That\u2019s when I had the idea for Backbeat BBQ, my one-man catering company. I didn\u2019t want to open a restaurant, but I did want to pull up at a Slayer show or a Harley dealership or a church or the L.A. Food Bank benefit and cook. It\u2019s kinda cool that I\u2019m able to do that\u2014and it\u2019s f*#%ing fun!The process of making music is a lot like cooking for a crowd: You create a recipe as you would a song. You prepare a meal as you would record in a studio. And you serve it as you would perform live. When people come back for seconds, well, that\u2019s your encore.Listen to the full interview on our the Bon App\u00e9tit Foodcast:ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Explore Bon App\u00e9titBarbecueCelebritiesFirst PersonRead MoreculturePaul Rudd Loves This Kansas City Barbecue Sandwich So Much, He Flies It to NYCBy Paul Rudd, as told to Alyse WhitneyLifestyleJapanese Breakfast on Making Her Mom\u2019s Kimchi Soup and Embracing Her Half-Korean RootsBy Alyse WhitneycultureChrissy Teigen on the Long Road to Making Her Second CookbookBy Alyse WhitneyLifestyleUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt Cast Gets Real About Viral Food TrendsBy Alyse WhitneyRecipes you want to make.
