But despite efforts to resist, I\u2019ve recently welcomed in a large and unattractive gizmo/gadget/thingamajig: Zwilling\u2019s universal lid.It\u2019s a good lid\u2014the grooves grip the edge of a pot or pan, making that satisfying plunk like when you finally get the blender on right\u2014but not only for one vessel. As the name implies, it\u2019s a good lid for all of your pots and pans, anything between 6 and 12 inches in diameter. That likely includes the entirety of your cookware collection.When frying capers are popping out of your skillet, or sputtering tomato paste is creating a murder scene on your walls, put on your universal lid until the wreckage dies down. When you\u2019re soaking beans and you need to cover the bowl, reach for the lid, not the plastic wrap. When you have no idea where your stock pot lid is (or if you even have one), the universal lid is there. And when you need to cover the pan for oven polenta immediately, grab the universal lid (oven-safe up to 500\u00b0 F!) instead of rummaging around the kitchen.A baking sheet may work in a pinch, but it\u2019s no match for the universal lid. The lid\u2019s heavy handle keeps it balanced on even a small frying pan. And where a baking sheet always seems to interfere with the pan\u2019s handle, the Saturn-like rings on the universal lid are intentionally off center, leaving you with full access to a good grip.Before you ask, yes, I do have a set of silicone lids (they were a gift from the person I live with, so I\u2019m stuck with them). They\u2019ve been great at getting us to pay attention to our foil and plastic wrap dependencies, but one size doesn\u2019t fit all or even most pans (and why do they make them for mugs\u2026?). They also have the same structure problem as silicone baking mats, which is that they have none. They\u2019re spineless, like dying fish, taking up more cabinet space than they warrant. A 10-inch silicone lid is too small to suction a 10-inch skillet, buckling from its balancing act right into your food. And a too-big lid risks flopping into your flame. They\u2019re too flimsy to be trusted and they get too hot to handle safely.Once you\u2019ve invested in your universal lid, your one remaining task is to figure out what to do with your now-defunct, mismatched, cumbersome lid collection. Take the whole lot to GoodWill so some lucky person may finally find their match, or bring them to your friends with the toddler (they make good instruments) and spend the rest of your relationship repenting. Or hang them on your living room wall for an avant-garde art installation. They can go anywhere\u2014but not in your cramped kitchen. There\u2019s only room for the one. But luckily, it\u2019s one that does it all.Buy it: Zwilling Cookware Universal Lid, $31 on AmazonAli Slagle is a recipe developer, stylist, and writer based in Brooklyn.All products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
