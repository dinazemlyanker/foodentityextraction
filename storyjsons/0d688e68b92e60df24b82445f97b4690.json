I\u2019ve gone through so much MaraNatha\u2014real talk: two jars a month\u2014that I have a small fleet of the empty canisters in my kitchen, just waiting for their second life.So believe me when I tell you that MaraNatha peanut butter will ruin you for all others (yes, even your friends Jif and Skippy).MaraNatha doesn\u2019t have any of the added sugars or oils of mass-produced peanut butter\u2014but you wouldn\u2019t know it from tasting it. Even though it\u2019s made with only two ingredients\u2014peanuts and salt\u2014it bypasses the pitfalls of all other \u201cnatural\u201d peanut butters (as in, it\u2019s not crumbly, dry, oily, gritty, or pasty). Instead, MaraNatha PB is all silky, velvety smoothness. It\u2019s as creamy as Nutella\u2014soft, spreadable, and all too easy to eat with a spoon. When I asked Joe LaPierre, MaraNatha\u2019s master roaster, what made their peanut butter so...is superior the word? Yes, superior!...he explained that the nuts are roasted in small batches, then double-ground (for extra creaminess!) within 30 days.Some recipes, particularly sensitive baking recipes and light dressings and sauces, will advise you against natural peanut butter. But MaraNatha is so lush I use it everywhere: Of course I spread it generously\u2014on rice crackers, toast, halved steamed sweet potatoes, split Medjool dates\u2014but it\u2019s also versatile enough to bake and cook with. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m above eating this PB straight from the jar (normally, I sprinkle a little salt on each spoonful). If you choose to refrigerate it (there\u2019s no need, but I keep it in the fridge for proximity to the jam), it becomes downright fudgy.One thing to note when buying, either online or at your local Whole Foods: Look carefully at the ingredients listed on the jar. MaraNatha makes many varieties of peanut butter and all of them have similar packaging, which means it\u2019s easy to confuse them. As long as the ingredient list is short and sweet\u2014just organic dry roasted peanuts and sea salt\u2014you know you've got the right one.Sure, MaraNatha is a bit pricier than your average peanut butter. But that\u2019s why I use a budgeting app! And did I mention that you, uh, get a free jar?Buy it: MaraNatha Organic Creamy Peanut Butter, $8 at luckyvitamin.comAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
