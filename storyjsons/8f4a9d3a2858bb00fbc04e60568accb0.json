Swapped lemon juice for lime this morning and it was just as good.AnonymousRochester, NY11/28/2020I was skeptical of the recipe, but decided to give it a go. I was not disappointed! This was a great use of avocado. It was a delicious and guilt-free indulgence. AnonymousCharlotte, NC3/24/2019This is so DELICIOUS!! I love avocados so this was perfect and easy.  I use coconut water to add an extra boost for my early morning workouts. amtdStone Mountain GA2/13/2019This is a drink pretty common in Asia.
