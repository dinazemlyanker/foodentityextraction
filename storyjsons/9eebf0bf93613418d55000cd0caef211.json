Examine the exterior and the crusty walls inside. Search the folds of shiny, black garbage bag hanging over the edge. Somewhere in there hangs a fruit sticker, ripped off of an apple or banana and smacked on its ugly new home. To most, these stickers are a nuisance, an inconveniently placed speed bump. But if you take the time to look at them, they\u2019re something else entirely. Art. Design. Typography. Personality. Fruit stickers hold them all, and it wasn\u2019t until we discovered @Fruit_stickers that we became so acutely aware of this under-appreciated art form.@Fruit_stickers is an Instagram account run by British graphic designer Kelly Angood,  who collects fruit stickers from around the world, peels them off of their respective fruits, scans them, and posts them on Instagram. She\u2019s posted over 700 so far. It\u2019s a collection of brilliant illustrations and graphic design. And above all, it\u2019s really fun. Fruit Stickers is my favorite Instagram account right now, and that\u2019s coming from someone who spends way too much time on Instagram.\u201cCollecting fruit stickers was never intentional,\u201d says Angood, who currently designs, manufactures, and distributes DIY analogue pinhole cameras (Yes, another niche interest). \u201cFor years I just stuck them inside pages in notebooks. Maybe it was because I liked the designs, maybe it felt like a little reward system for eating fruit. I wasn\u2019t doing it consciously.\u201d She collects them on trips abroad or at her local market, and others she receives as donations, including a collection of stickers from the 1960s - 1980s she received last year from an American woman.We asked Angood to share her 24 favorite fruit stickers, and her thoughts on what makes them more likely to be hanging in a design museum than inside a trashcan:\u201cI love these Linda stickers. They always involve a woman in a banana, and I like to think of them as The Little Mermaid...but fruit.\u201d\u201cThis is a great color combination with great graphics. Both very \u201890s. Something about it reminds me of the titles to Saved By The Bell. Saved by The Bell Pepper? Too far?\u201d\u201cThere are some really beautiful stickers out there\u2014great typography, amazing colors, unusual shapes. But to be honest, I love it when the growers decide to anthropomorphize some citrus fruit or a banana. These are amazing.\u201d\u201cI believe this is actually a pineapple tag, rather than a sticker, but let\u2019s not split hairs. This is from the \u201890s, and one of its key messages is \u2018Jet-fresh.\u2019 I find it difficult to see that phrasing happening in 2018, when we have such an emphasis on reducing food miles and sourcing locally.\u201d\u201cFor me, this one is all about the mid-century style orange. You could easily see that element repeated on some wallpaper in your grandma\u2019s house.\u201d\u201cThis is a melon sticker from Spain. Why the bird? We may never know.\u201d\u201cGothic lettering? Check. Tiny image of Rembrandt? Check. Complete and logical relationship to it being on an orange? Umm.\u201d\"This is obviously from Florida, and the heart shape is just cute.\u201d\u201cI also like it when small companies steal a really well known brand and use it as their sticker, as though the brand\u2019s reputation can somehow translate into something as simple as an apple. Example A: this fake Rolex sticker.\u201d\u201cI love stickers from Southern Europe, and this Spanish clementine is no exception. The type and color combination are simply fun.\u201d\u201cI like to image that the person that designed this is a superhero in his or her spare time. Or at least goes to Comicon regularly.\u201d\u201cThe leaf shape is very popular in Spain, where this sticker came from. Let\u2019s assume the grower is a massive Batman fan.\u201d\u201cThe negative space in this design is great. It feels as though you\u2019re looking into a science diagram of a snake swallowing the banana whole. Complimentary colors are on point, and I give bonus points for a pun-based name.\u201d\u201cThese are Space Jam stickers. That should be about all you need to know.\u201d\u201cI feel as though the general message of this sticker is that bananas are great fuel to keep you going when you\u2019re active. That\u2019s all well and good, but also...IT\u2019S A BANANA PLAYING BASKETBALL. HELLO!\u201d\u201cThis was donated to me, and I have no idea of its context at all, other than it\u2019s brilliant and fairly old. But imagine the design meeting.\u201d\u201cThis space sticker is part of a series. I have no idea why space and fruit seems like a good match, but I like to imagine fruits as planets.\u201d\u201cThe Dole \u2018Bananimals\u2019 are maybe some of my favorite fruit stickers ever. I mean, seriously, an octopus made of bananas? A bear with banana extremities? What\u2019s not to enjoy about that? They even made plush toys in the \u201890s. (Yep, I have an eBay alert for them.)\u201d\u201cOrange smiles! This is some next level anthropomorphizing. Never mind a character, let\u2019s just make the fruit alive. Some say it\u2019s fun. For others, it\u2019s the stuff of nightmares.\u201dNeed an excuse to buy some fruit?
