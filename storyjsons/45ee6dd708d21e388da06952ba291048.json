Will the sculpted ridged humps come out torn and raggedy? After all that time you put in, you\u2019ve got a cake with 50-50 odds: Will it come out cake-box perfect? Or will it look like it got excavated from the rubble of Pompeii?This is where all the time I spend on Reddit comes in handy. There, somewhere in a stream of comments, a friendly stranger recommended Pam Baking Spray for, well, everything. There\u2019s regular Pam, aerosol baking lube (sorry, that\u2019s what it is!) that spits out a combination of oils and super flammable hydrocarbons (which is why it turns into a flamethrower when used IMPROPERLY). And then there\u2019s Pam Baking, which adds \u201creal flour\u201d and some \u201cflavors,\u201d to that mix. Instead of coating a pan with a sheen of slippery oil, Pam Baking comes out in a frosty white spray that smells like a sugar cookie.This is the kind of preservative-filled chemical product that professional pastry chefs Do. Not. Use. Pastry chefs will expertly coat the pan with butter and dust it with flour and accomplish the same nonstick thing. Pam is kinda lazy. And I am kinda lazy. Which is why I am drawn to this alternative. (When I flour pans, I always do a shoddy job and the cake still sticks. Did I use too much flour? Not enough? I certainly used enough flour to coat my entire kitchen floor, counters, and sink!)I recently used Pam for baking on Maida Heatter\u2019s East 62nd Street Lemon Cake, one of the first viral recipes from pre-internet times. The last time I made it, the cake was a stuck-to-the-pan dried-out disaster. THIS TIME, it sha-wumped out of the pan easily. There was one blemish because I definitely underbaked the cake by 15 minutes, a user error I can\u2019t fix with aerosol. But that was it. (On the Pam Baking bottle, there\u2019s a lovely Bundt cake with a delicate zigzagged glaze. Even the people at Pam know that sometimes there will be imperfections, and you will hide them with glaze.)I\u2019ve since used the spray on my pan for Basically\u2019s easy chocolate cake, underneath the parchment paper for Basque cheesecake, and for Food52\u2019s Genius Desserts almond cake. All worked just fine, and I didn\u2019t detect that the mysterious vanilla flavor had transferred to the final baked product. I\u2019d guess that they put those \u201cnatural flavors\u201d in there as a food science mind trick for cooks. When you use it, it smells like cake, therefore it\u2019s for cake, which means your cake will be great. I think this stuff is fascinating, but you might think it\u2019s an affront to the art of cooking. Whatever! It\u2019s $3. What have you got to lose? Your credibility as a food writer?
