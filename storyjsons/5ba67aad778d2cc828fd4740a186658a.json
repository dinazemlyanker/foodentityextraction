When it comes out of the oven, it\u2019s still jiggly in the center, which means you can sing \u201cgettin\u2019 jiggy with it\u201d if you\u2019re the type to serenade your dessert. And while it has been named a tart formally, it\u2019s essentially a giant baked pudding\u2014the custard, thickened with egg yolks and cornstarch, is made on the stove, then transferred to a sugared cake pan and sent into the oven until it\u2019s firm enough to slice.The finished tart tastes like cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e after the shattering sugar top has capsized into the middle\u2014milky caramel, burnt sugar. But in this recipe, you don\u2019t have to portion custard into individual ramekins, set up a water bath, or hold your breath and flip it out like a flan. It\u2019s a victory for those of us who are just as determined to eat homemade desserts as we are lazy and hesitant.Top with whipped cream that billows like a sail.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigAnd that\u2019s not this tart\u2019s only trick. See, normally a pastry cream needs to be babied (a.k.a. \u201ctempered\u201d): Warm up milk on the stove, then ladle some of it gradually into a bowl of egg yolks whisked with cornstarch and sugar to heat the eggs slowly, lest they scramble. Then, add the newly-hot eggs back to the pot of milk, stirring all the while. Claire, our hero, dreamt up a less fussy method: Just whisk all of the ingredients together from the get-go, then bring the mixture up to heat very slowly, continuously whisking.I can\u2019t sugarcoat it\u2014you\u2019ll do a lot of whisking\u2014but for the first two-thirds of the process, until the custard starts to thicken, you can read a whole (short) New Yorker article on your phone and get a solid forearm workout. Most importantly, Claire\u2019s whisk-a-lot technique is less prone to egg clumping, meaning your custard tart will be smooth and silky when it comes out of the oven, golden and beautiful. If the custard is set on the perimeter but paler than you like, stick it under the broiler for 2 to 3 minutes (watching carefully) until it\u2019s as burnished as you\u2019d like.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.To make the finished tart extra fancy, top each slice with whipped cream and macerated peaches, plums, and berries. But the end of stone fruit season is nigh and this cozy, pudding-y tart is too good to save \u2018til next year. I suggest switching out the summer produce for caramelized apples or pears, or even jam or citrus curd. When I made it recently, I topped each slice with preserved white mulberries I found in the recesses of my pantry and a couple halved figs.If you\u2019re not a fan of soft-on-soft (maybe you\u2018re one of those people who lives for a firm mattress), you might consider adding an element of crunch, like toasted nuts, cacao nibs, or crumbles of the meringues you made with the whites leftover from the custard....What? I said was feeling fancy.Your creamy, eggy, caramel-y tart awaits:Custard Tart with Cream and Fresh FruitIf eggy flan-like desserts are your thing, you are going to love this crustless vanilla-infused tart.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titDessertCustardRead MorecookingA Rhubarb Custard Cake Somewhere Between Pudding and HeavenBy Emily SchultzRecipes you want to make.
