It was taken from her living room in San Francisco, and the morning sunlight should have been streaming through her east-facing windows. Instead, the room was suffused with a reddish glow so dim that I could barely make out her sofa and coffee table. Fires were raging to the south in Santa Cruz and to the north in wine country, and the smoke blanketing SF was a horrifying indication of the destruction just miles away.In 2020 over 4 million acres were claimed by fire in California. One of the largest incidents was the Glass Fire, which spread throughout Napa and Sonoma in late September and October. Weeks before the fire was contained, winemakers were already sounding a death knell for the season\u2019s crop. Grapes become more susceptible to smoke taint the closer they get to harvest, and the Glass Fire hit right as Napa growers were bringing in their haul. Wine made with grapes that have been blanketed by smoke tastes\u2014you guessed it\u2014smoky. \u201cHints of ashtray\u201d is not a descriptor anyone wants applied to their Chardonnay.But as Diddy fans know, there\u2019s more that can be done with grapes than make wine. Unlike tequila or Scotch, vodka can be distilled from anything that has sugar content, including wheat, potatoes, and whey. Because vodka is a highly refined spirit, you likely can\u2019t taste the difference between one made from corn and one made from beets\u2014or even one made from smoke-tinged grapes.Hangar 1\u2019s Smoke Point Vodka is made from just that. Located in Alameda, about 10 miles to the east of my mom\u2019s house, Hangar 1 has a deep connection to California\u2019s grape growers; its signature vodka is distilled from both grapes and grain. With vineyards hurting, they wanted to find a use for Napa\u2019s adulterated crop. The resulting vodka, made from Merlot and Malbec grapes, has not a trace of smoke\u2014which is not to say it\u2019s lacking in character. Unlike most mass-produced vodkas that are made using neutral grain spirit, Smoke Point tastes like something. To me it\u2019s reminiscent of Claire Saffitz\u2019s honey-vanilla sabl\u00e9 cookies, ideal for martinis or even sipping straight.Smoke Point is a limited release, with only 4,800 bottles in existence. While I hope this is the first and last year Hangar 1 will need to step in and create demand for smoke-tainted grapes, that seems rather unlikely. With climate change creating ever more devastating fire seasons, there\u2019s another reason to add a bottle of Smoke Point to your bar cart\u2014all proceeds go to the California Fire Foundation.Hangar 1 Smoke Point Vodka$57 at Reserve BarExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make.
