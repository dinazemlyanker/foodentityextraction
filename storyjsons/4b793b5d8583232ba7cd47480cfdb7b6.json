This one is part of the Healthyish Guide to Being Alone, a series of tips, recipes, and stories about how to be alone when we\u2019re together and together when we\u2019re alone.When you say \u201csex toy,\u201d people always think of vibrators. But in the past couple years, a few clitoral suction products like the Lelo Sona have come out, and it's a game changer. You know that saying, \u201cIf a tree falls in the forest and nobody\u2019s there to hear it, did it make a sound?\u201d This toy is a tree falling in the forest without making a sound. It\u2019s not too loud or intrusive, but I can achieve multiple orgasms within a 10 minute window.It\u2019s a nice product for people who don\u2019t like the intensity and noise of a vibrator, or who just want to experience their body in a new way. I think of it like doing yoga for orgasms. Once you retrain your body from going from a Hitachi Magic Wand to a suction product, you\u2019ll reimagine what pleasure looks like for yourself. It\u2019s off the charts: I always heard people talk about quick orgasms, but I couldn\u2019t get there. Now I can pop off an orgasm in 5 minutes, which is great because I\u2019m a real get-up-and-go person. When I go to the office to sell sex toys to others, I want to be as happy as possible! \u2013Nenna Joiner, owner of Feelmore Adult in Oakland, CABuy it: Lelo Sona Cruise, $115 at feelmore510.com or $118 at lelo.comAll products featured on Healthyish are independently selected by our editors.
