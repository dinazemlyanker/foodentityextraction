We'll catch up with Emily and Heather regularly for stories, recipes, and dispatches from the front lines of Botanica, their women-led, vegetable-first kitchen.Here at Botanica, we have passionate feelings about salsa verde. It\u2019s our desert-island sauce, and would probably pass muster on a handful of sand or a rogue shell if things got really bad. The version we serve at the restaurant involves vinegar-macerated shallots, garlic, parsley, cilantro, capers, California olive oil, lemon juice and zest, and salt. We drizzle it over roasted veg and meat, spoon it over fried eggs, and stir it through thick, garlicky yogurt, moat-style. This rendition\u2014same idea, minus the shallots and capers, plus pimenton and orange juice and zest\u2014is just-barely-sweet, smoky, and bright enough to balance the fattiness of the fish we\u2019re serving it on.Let\u2019s talk about that fish. As the name Botanica suggests, we\u2019re all about living that plant life. But show us a piece of pristine wild Pacific seafood and we\u2019ll likely swoon in a manner ordinarily reserved for our romantic partnerships. We feel strongly about eating sustainably procured fish, and are adamant about sourcing from the ocean that\u2019s nearest to us.You can (and should) shop this way, too! A visit to a local fishmonger or farmer\u2019s market is a good place to start. When in doubt about what to buy, find the person with the fish knife, tell them your slow-roasting plans, and ask what\u2019s in stock that\u2019s exciting them. Once procured, we think you should take it sloooooooooooow. While there\u2019s a time and place for a good sear, we adore a low-and-slow technique for salmon and similar fish. It\u2019s a foolproof way to coax maximum lusciousness\u2014and pan juice magic\u2014from a thick filet. Lay the fish in a roasting pan, dress it with a simple topping of shaved shallots, citrus zest, olive oil, and salt, and stick it in a 250 degree oven. This gentle cooking method allows the fat to soften into the flesh and the juices to pool in the pan rather than cook off. (If you\u2019re not a salmon fan, don\u2019t fear: The slow-roasting method works wonderfully with cod, bass, or any thicker, higher-fat-content fish.)While the fish cooks, make your salsa verde. We love this recipe because it\u2019s infinitely flexible. No cilantro? Try mint or dill or a combination of minced rosemary and rough-chopped oregano. No herbs at all? Put those pesky fennel fronds to use. Not an orange in sight? Nothing a spoonful of honey can\u2019t fix. You get the idea; this one is hard to screw up.Depending on the thickness and size of your fish, the cooking process can take anywhere from 30 to 50 minutes. You\u2019ll know the salmon is ready when the albumin, aka that white stuff that seeps out, starts to be released. When in doubt, pull it out and check the center. You\u2019re aiming for a fall-apart, spoon-tender texture that, if it\u2019s your first time slow-roasting fish, might read to you as undercooked.When the fish is ready, pull it from its citrusy steam bath and head straight to the table, roasting pan and all. Though another perk of this technique is that it can hang a bit until you\u2019re ready to serve, if need be. Redistribute the pan juices over top of the fish, and, when it\u2019s go time, top each serving with a liberal spoonful of salsa verde.We hope you love this technique\u2014and the salsa verde life!\u2014as much as we do.
