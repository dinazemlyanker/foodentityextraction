When something's so easy to make that you don't even need one. Welcome to It's That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.When my fridge is packed with the annoying kind of leftovers\u2014none of which make a meal but all of which I\u2019d feel guilty getting rid of\u2014I know it\u2019s time to make this fridge-clean-out, pantry-raid koshari.Koshari is a cozy pile of warm carbs\u2014traditionally, cooked rice, lentils, macaroni, and chickpeas, all mixed together\u2014smothered in perky tomato sauce and buried in fried shallots. Sometimes it\u2019s stuffed in a pita, for an extra layer of starchy comfort. When my half-Egyptian (and half-Bolivian) husband first made it for me, I thought he\u2019d lost his mind with all the carbs on carbs on carbs. But then I tasted it and couldn\u2019t get enough. The dynamic textures of chewy pasta, fluffy rice, creamy beans, and crunchy shallots had me hooked.To make it, start by cooking that last handful of pasta in the box. You want something small and spoonable like ditalini or macaroni. If you don\u2019t have a short pasta, simply break up some spaghetti\u2014easy! While the noodles boil, warm up a scoop of cooked lentils, that half-can of beans, and some leftover takeout rice or any cooked grain. It\u2019s easiest to just zap in the microwave, but you can get fancy and heat it on the stovetop with a splash of bean broth, water, or stock to keep it from drying out.Meanwhile, saut\u00e9 some chopped onion and garlic in olive oil until tender, then add your chile of choice: good ol' chile flakes, fruity Kashmiri red chile powder, hot-stuff cayenne, or even smoky chipotle. You can go off the rails here if you want, adding a hit of cumin, coriander, or a warm spice blend like hawaij. Give the spices a minute to bloom, then add whatever tomato product you have on hand: tomato pur\u00e9e, leftover marinara, hand-crushed canned tomatoes, or even diced fresh plum tomatoes. Simmer for a few minutes and then, once everyone has gotten to know each other, add a few glugs of any vinegar that catches your eye. Don\u2019t be shy, you want this sauce to slap you in the face with spice and acid. It\u2019s the only thing keeping you from taking a nap in the carb bed you're about to make.To bring it home, mix up the pasta, beans, and grains in a bowl (or pita) and pour on your perky tomato sauce. Finish with a big, generous handful of crispy fried shallots, or any frizzled allium, and dig in.Once you know how to make koshari, you\u2019ll never think twice about whether to save those last few scoops of rice or the half-cup tomato passata. Because the answer is always YES!Explore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimpleBasicallyRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
