Here, Viet-Cajun crawfish and pho have clinched a place in the modern culinary canon alongside Tex-Mex and barbecue; even better, you can conquer it all in a long weekend. And as the city rebuilds itself in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, the restaurant scene continues to become more and more vibrant. Chefs and bartenders are crafting delicious cocktails, getting us excited about brunch (spaghetti sandwich!), and shucking plump Gulf oysters. So dig in to our favorites\u2014and don\u2019t forget to pack your stretchy pants.The New Spot You Need to HitHow do you pick out the industry folks at Nancy\u2019s Hustle, a buzzy new neighborhood bistro in East Downtown? It will be late (the kitchen is open until midnight), and they\u2019ll be geeking out over the natural wines. They\u2019ll also be snacking on tender lamb dumplings and Nancy cakes\u2014a kind of johnnycake topped with trout roe. You should join them.Murder Point oysters at One Fifth.\nPhoto by Wynn MyersYes, You Should Be Eating Gulf OystersIf you spot Murder Point oysters on a menu, don\u2019t think twice: Order a dozen. Chefs are falling for these creamy Gulf bivalves, which are cultivated by Murder Point Oyster Co. in the waters of southwestern Alabama. The unique harvesting process creates strong, deep shells that cup the plump, buttery, not-too-big meat within. Look for them at restaurants that include One Fifth and State of Grace.4 Dishes You Need to Try in AsiatownThere\u2019s no better way to experience the diversity of Houston\u2019s restaurants than to devour Bellaire Boulevard, a six-mile stretch home to the city\u2019s most adventurous bites. Chef Justin Yu of Theodore Rex is a regular, so we asked him to share his can\u2019t-miss spots.Chicken hara masala at Himalaya Restaurant.\nPhoto by Wynn MyersHimalaya RestaurantYes, order spicy goat biryani and airy garlic naan, but whatever you do, don\u2019t skip the chicken hara masala at this always-bustling Indian/Pakistani spot just north of the main Asiatown strip. Tender chunks of chicken float in a fragrant herb-packed spicy and tangy green curry sauce that begs for an extra order of naan for sauce mopping. \u201cIt\u2019s the one thing I get every time I go,\u201d Yu says.Salt-and-pepper pork spareribs at Shanghai Restaurant.\nPhoto by Wynn MyersShanghai RestaurantDespite its name, this unassuming family joint (where Yu has been eating since he was a kid) serves classic Cantonese-style dishes like the transcendently crispy salt-and-pepper pork spareribs, lightly breaded and fried with batons of green onion and dried red chiles. \u201cThey\u2019re a perfect example of the simplicity and technique that define this incredible region\u2019s cooking,\u201d Yu says.Butter-doused crawfish at Crawfish & Noodles.\nPhoto by Wynn MyersCrawfish & NoodlesTie on a plastic bib and grab the nearest roll of paper towels\u2014it\u2019s about to get messy. The order at this sprawling restaurant with communal tables is the namesake ruby-red crawfish, boiled and doused in a butter sauce spiked with Cajun spices and garlic. Get them extra-spicy for the tear-inducing levels of cayenne; eat them without the optional latex gloves for the street cred. (\u201cIf you see someone wearing gloves, they either don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing or they just got a manicure,\u201d Yu says.) Take breaks to try chicken wings in a fish sauce\u2013spiked glaze and a tower of cracker-crisp Gulf blue crabs, stir-fried and served whole with a pair of shell crackers.Pho ga at Pho Binh Bellaire.\nPhoto by Wynn MyersPho Binh BellaireIn a city where you can find an exceptional banh mi or a bowl of pho at every turn, this family-owned Vietnamese noodle joint stands out for its clean, restorative broths. Yu favors the fortifying yet light pho ga with plenty of dark- and white-meat chicken or its beef counterpart with brisket and crispy fat, which is rich with the heady scent of cinnamon and anise. \u201cI\u2019ll come here in the morning on my day off if I\u2019m feeling the effects of a late night out,\u201d Yu says. Dress your bowl with all the fresh accompanying toppings: crunchy bean sprouts,  sliced jalape\u00f1o, and torn fresh Thai basil, sawtooth leaves, and cilantro. Finish it all with a squeeze of bright lime.Brenda Loza of Nany's Hustle and the lamb tartare with flatbread.\nPhoto by Wynn MyersGet to Know MontroseIt\u2019s no surprise Houston\u2019s hippest neighborhood is also home to some of its best bites. Here are five places to hit.BlacksmithStart your day with an expertly pulled espresso at Blacksmith and a pastry from Morningstar, Blacksmith\u2019s sister caf\u00e9, whose crazy creations (think black-and-white mochi doughnuts) have developed a cult following.La Guadalupana Bakery & Caf\u00e9All-day Mexican breakfast is the specialty at this longtime local favorite, where you can find chilaquiles and egg-chorizo tacos. Pair with the Vampiro, a layered elixir of carrot, beet, and orange juices.One FifthChef Chris Shepherd closed his popular Underbelly earlier this year (he\u2019s opening steakhouse Georgia James in the space soon). In the meantime, Shepherd is keeping busy at One Fifth, his restaurant that will change concepts annually for five years. For its second iteration, One Fifth Romance Languages, Shepherd is playing with Italian, French, and Spanish cuisines, with blue crab chitarra and snails en cro\u00fbte on the menu. This fall the flavors will become eastern Mediterranean.The House of Lancaster cocktail at Anvil Bar & Refuge.\nPhoto by Wynn MyersAnvil Bar & RefugeYou can\u2019t tour Westheimer Road, Montrose\u2019s main drag, without stopping by Anvil Bar & Refuge, Houston\u2019s OG cocktail bar that opened in 2009. Its famous 100 List features a flawless version of nearly every classic drink imaginable from an Absinthe Frappe to a Zombie.West Alabama Ice HouseIf you\u2019ve got a lazy afternoon to kill, head to the famed West Alabama Ice House and set up at a shaded picnic table with an icy Lone Star (it\u2019s said they sell more than almost any bar in the entire state). At lunchtime, cross the street to the Tacos Tierra Caliente truck for barbacoa, lengua, and al pastor tacos to bring back with you to the bar.Lunch at Tacos Tierra Calienta.\nPhoto by Wynn MyersScore the Best Brunch in TownThe last place you\u2019re trying to go after a night out is a bar. But the neon-lit Better Luck Tomorrow isn\u2019t just a bar, it\u2019s also home to one of the city\u2019s most inventive brunches. The spaghetti sandwich\u2014red sauce, noodles, and burrata griddled between pain de mie\u2014is hangover-food gold.Drink Up On a Downtown Bar CrawlIf You Want Wine... Public Services Wine & WhiskyAt Public Services, Sommelier Justin Vann keeps it weird in a good way with a huge selection of natural wines you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find elsewhere in town, plus dozens of sherries and Madeiras by the glass.Peter Jahnke of Tongue-Cut Sparrow.\nPhoto by Wynn MyersIf You Want Cocktails... Tongue-Cut SparrowTo find this speakeasy, look for the plain door in the back room of the Pastry War, a boisterous mezcal bar that\u2019s worth its own visit. Behind the secret door and upstairs, dark wood and jazz standards mix with classic cocktails (try the rum-filled Swizzle).If You Want Beer... ConservatoryConservatory is the city\u2019s first food hall. You can choose from more than 60 beers on tap, many from local breweries such as Saint Arnold, 8th Wonder, and Buffalo Bayou. Pair your brew with snacks from one of the hall\u2019s pop-up food stands.Find the rest of our City Guides here.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHoustonCity GuidesRestaurants + TravelTexasRead MorecultureWhat It's Like to Work at Franklin BBQ for 24 Hours StraightBy Alex DelanycultureWhat It Takes to Open the Next Big Barbecue Joint in TexasBy Mike SutterPhotography by Robert Jacob LermaRecipes you want to make.
