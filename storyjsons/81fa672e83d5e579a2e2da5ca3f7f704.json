Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,Early last week I woke up with a screaming back ache\u2014a type of pain I've never felt before. After a lot of hours spent in doctors' offices and MRI machines, I found out that I herniated a disk. Not great, but not a life sentence either. I was ready to take the drugs, start the physical therapy, and get back to my walking/running/biking/dancing life, but my back had other ideas. It's been a sloooow couple weeks, and I mean that very literally. No gym, no bike, no running,  even if the train is pulling into the station and I'm on the wrong side of the turnstile. Walking is okay, so I've been doing a lot of that. And while I'm itching to run around again, I'm forcing myself to stay with the slowness and lean into the calm so I can actually heal. But OMG it's hard.The already iconic French-ish Onion Soup\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Susie TheodorouWhat I'm Eating NowA few months ago I told Chris Morocco that I wanted to create a Healthyish recipe called \"French-ish Onion Soup.\" He went into mad-scientist mode, as he does, and the result was the most popular Healthyish recipe we've ever posted. But this soup is more than a pretty face. It's rich and caramel-y and savory with just enough cheese to feel like you're pampering yourself.Nothing much else is happening in my kitchen, TBH. Last weekend I was in Philadelphia, where I drank a tahini milkshake from Goldie, a thing I'd been dreaming about ever since Alex Delany mentioned it two years ago. I also had a great dinner at Sarvida, the follow-up Filipino spot from the owner of Perla. Tomorrow I'm flying to Amsterdam for an actual vacation. I think I forgot what that word means, but I'm excited to find out. Any food recommendations?
