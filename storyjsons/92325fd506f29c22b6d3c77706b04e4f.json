Maybe your host is an old friend who requires nothing more than your presence, a six pack, and an extra pair of hands to do the dishes. But maybe not. Maybe she\u2019s the exceedingly elegant, very finicky, brilliantly witty aunt of your fianc\u00e9, or maybe he\u2019s a classically trained cook who plans to wine and dine you for a week, or an entrepreneur who seems to already own everything imaginable but never has a moment for herself.Enter the all-important hostess gift. Whether your host is a shochu drinker or chocolate lover, a tea connoisseur or an amateur chef with a tiny kitchen, I\u2019ve discovered that the best gifts are the ones that provide both instant gratification and lasting pleasure (read: reminder to invite you back.) This could be a handcrafted tequila bottle that becomes a favorite vase, a set of linen napkins, chic tea tins, or a bag of best-in-show self-pampering products. If you\u2019re about to land on someone\u2019s doorstep, I\u2019ve got you covered. Choose a bundle of items or just one that fits the bill. These are tried and true and, well, hint hint, they\u2019re on my wish list too.For the tea connoisseur with a flair for colorParis for Her combines rose, raspberry, lychee and green tea. Th\u00e9 de Moines, a black and green blend, marries the floral citrus burst of bergamot with sensual jasmine and creamy vanilla, and Go\u00fbt Russe 7 Agrumes pairs bergamot with six other citrus fruits and black tea for a zesty morning brew. Better yet, the chic, colorful tins from Paris add color to a shelf and can be reused.Palais des Th\u00e9s Signature Tea Blends$21 at Food52For the Francophile oenophileCh\u00e2teau Lass\u00e8gue is enviably nestled on the C\u00f4te de Saint \u00c9milion in Bordeaux. Seventh-generation vigneron Pierre Seillan and his son Nicolas Seillan, using 50-year-old vines planted in clay and limestone-rich soil, have released a deliciously silky, beautifully rounded 2017 Grand Cru with notes of cassis and violet that is both highly drinkable now and a great candidate for aging. Ahead of the curve in prioritizing sustainability, the vineyard is notable for melding age-old traditions with responsible environmental practices. And to open the bottle, the Laguiole En Aubrac Waiters Corkscrew in olive wood is made to be handed down through generations. It\u2019s a timeless classic.Laguiole En Aubrac Sommelier's Corkscrew$250 at Williams Sonoma$154 at AmazonFor the salad artistThese ingenious Global Gardens fruit-infused California balsamic vinegars and extra-virgin olive oils come from one of the world\u2019s only certified olive oil sommeliers. Mix at a 1:3 ratio and your vinaigrette is done. The Pomegranate Power Golden Balsamic Vinegar and Back Yard EVOO instantly add character to a salad of grains or couscous, or drizzle the Blood Orange Dark Balsamic over burrata or a winter caprese made of sliced citrus fruits, buffalo mozzarella, and a handful of pine nuts. If possible, bring fresh greens from the farmers market in a beautiful black acacia salad bowl.Global Gardens Cold Pressed Extra-Virgin Olive Oil$50 at Food52Global Gardens Fruit Infused Balsamic Vinegars$30 at Food52Black Acacia Wood Serving Bowl$50 at Sur La TableFor the calm seeker:This hostess gift acknowledges that entertaining, however fun, takes work\u2014and this bundle (aside from your excellent company) is the reward. From Rishi Tea, four favorites: Jade Cloud and Orange Blossom for green tea drinkers, White Peony for an understated floral aroma, Hibiscus Berry for a fruity dose of antioxidants. Instruct your host to brew a pot of tea, light their new Maison Louis Marie candle, and lavish a bath with oil from Susanne Kaufmann. If you want an absolute guarantee you\u2019ll be invited back, throw in a jar of Augustinus Bader\u2019s cult-favorite body cream. Created by one of the world\u2019s top stem-cell scientists, it was formulated to harness the body\u2019s power to self heal and regenerate its own stem-cells\u2014making it both an investment and an indulgence.White Peony Organic White Tea$39 at Rishi TeaNo.04 Bois de Balincourt Candle$36 at SephoraSusanne Kaufmann Bath Oil Trio$45 at SSENSEThe Body Cream by Augustinus Bader$165 at NordstromFor the avant-garde chocolate loverThe handmade Avant Garde square bars with caramel interiors from Chocolat Moderne may riff on Mondrian\u2019s squares, but their impossible-to-resist flavors are decidedly contemporary. Don\u2019t try to choose between the dark chocolate with blood orange bergamot; the milk chocolate with smoky mezcal; the dark chocolate smoked Welsh sea salt; the berries and lavender; or the passion fruit and cardamom. More is more, so spring for two or three of each so as not to eat your entire gift en route and arrive empty handed.Avant-Garde Chocolate Bars$10 at ChocolatmoderneFor the clean-spiritedShochu is the most popular spirit in Japan, but it\u2019s still not widely known in the States. When made from rice and water, it has a crisp freshness to it similar to that of silver tequila and vodka, and it happens to be carb-free, sugar-free, and gluten-free. Mujen produces three varieties: AI, which is clear and can be drunk neat or mixed; The Original, also clear, and ideal for cocktails; and X, which is aged and has a similar mouthful to single malt. Made in a woman-run fourth-generation distillery in Japan, Mujen is that ancient recipe that suddenly feels very contemporary.Mujen Rice SpiritsShop Now at MujenFor a close friendBecause you can never have too many pillows and linens. With bold geometric shapes and soft colors, these blue and cream pillows can be tossed on a sofa, a bed, an armchair. A bundle of linen napkins tied with a tassel will be a reminder of your visit. Mix three colors for a set of 12.Bayview Pillow Cover$198 $130 at Serena & LilySalento Linen Napkins$88 at Serena & Lily (8-Pack)For the BFF who never springs on luxury for herselfThese best-of beauty items are extravagant, so save them for that bestie whose guest bedroom might as well have your name on the door and whose kitchen is already better stocked than yours. Eyes to Kill mascara from Armani is not the name of the new James Bond movie, but Daniel Craig\u2019s successor should be so lucky to have this weapon in his arsenal. Chantecaille\u2019s newly reformulated BioLifting Mask does exactly what it promises. Tom Ford\u2019s Gloss Luxe for lips in Bare Assed is sparkle for grown-ups. Herm\u00e8s Poudre d\u2019Orf\u00e8vre face and eye illuminating powder gives skin a candlelit glow. And Sisley\u2019s Velvet Nourishing Cream with Saffron Flowers smells divine. Put it all in a Champagne bucket, and tie with a silk ribbon.Celebration Wine Bowl$149 at Mark & GrahamTom Ford Gloss Luxe$58 at Neiman MarcusFor the space-challenged gourmet cookAnyone with a small kitchen understands the need for stackability, but until now the beloved Staub pots (on the list of BA\u2019s favorite Dutch ovens) and skillets were only for those with the space to put them side by side. Not so any longer. A stackable set includes a 5-quart Dutch oven, a braiser, a grill pan, and a universal lid and takes up just 13\" in diameter. This is for that seriously altruistic friend who hosted your kids for two weeks\u2014and tutored them in long division\u2014while you took your frayed nerves to a yoga retreat to regain some semblance of mental balance after a year of Zoom-only school.Staub Stackable 4-Piece Set$735 $580 at Williams SonomaFor the tequila connoisseurClase Azul makes some of the finest tequilas and mezcals on the market. Most come in a decanter, handmade and hand-painted by Indigenous Mazahua artisans in Santa Mar\u00eda Canchesda. Long after the tequila is gone, these can be repurposed as vases, water bottles, even candleholders. Try the mezcal Guerrero for its lemony, woody, full-bodied freshness and the tequila reposado for its incredible richness and creamy notes of vanilla, candied orange peel, and clove.Clase Azul Reposado$160 at Reserve BarFor the stylish teetotalerThree Spirit, a line of nonalcoholic spirits made with functional plants, has been known to save the day\u2014and maybe the morning after too. The Livener energizes with schisandra berry and guayusa, the Social Elixir pairs cacao, molasses, tea and yerba mate in a dark brew that warms even when served cold. And Nightcap, with valerian root (a key ingredient in many of BA\u2019s favorite sleepy-time teas), ashwagandha and ginger, promises a good night\u2019s sleep\u2014which is perhaps the ultimate gift of all.Three Spirit Non-Alcoholic Spirits$39 at Three Spirit$39 at Food52Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingGift GuidesCultureRecipes you want to make.
