Commonly found in East and Southeast Asian cooking, hot pot is centered around a vessel of roiling broth, into which diners plunk meats, seafood, vegetables, and starches. It\u2019s a communal dining experience that calls for your attention and participation, as you throw handfuls of chrysanthemum greens or blocks of fish tofu into the broth. It demands that you be hospitable as beef slices reach peak medium-rare or thin rounds of potatoes soften to the perfect snappy texture\u2014a signal for you to swiftly ferry them over to your fellow diners\u2019 bowls. \u201cEveryone is part of the journey with you,\u201d says Eric Sze, the chef-owner of 886 and wenwen in New York City. \u201cThat\u2019s why I love hot pot so much.\u201dWhen he was growing up in Taiwan, Sze was surrounded by many different types of hot pot restaurants. But he was stunned to find virtually none in his college town of Ithaca, New York. A homesick student, he decided to make it himself for his then-girlfriend (now wife) with whatever meats he could find in the nearest grocery store\u2019s freezer section along with Napa cabbage, lettuce, enoki mushrooms, and vermicelli. Immediately, he was hooked and started ordering hot pot at restaurants wherever he traveled and perfecting his own game at home. If you\u2019ve made hot pot once, he explains, it becomes something you know and from there you can riff. \u201cEvery time, I pick up new things, like I\u2019m going to try adding taro, or beef top blade instead of just short rib,\u201d Sze explains.That\u2019s the beauty of hot pot: It\u2019s choose-your-own adventure once you\u2019ve learned the basics. And if you haven\u2019t? Well, you\u2019ve come to the right place. Welcome to our hot pot primer. Taking our lead from Sze, we\u2019re sharing broths that\u2019ll be the foundation of your meal, the perfect variety (and prep) of fixings to dip into those broths, gear that guarantees the smoothest hot pot experience, and our very chill rules to turning all these elements into the dynamic, delicious feast we love. By the end of it, you won\u2019t be lukewarm\u2014you\u2019ll be a hot pot obsessive.Skip Ahead:The GearThe BrothThe IngredientsThe TechniqueThe Condiments1. Get Your Gear In OrderBefore you begin laying out your aesthetically pleasing hot pot spread, you need the right equipment. There is only one piece of gear we\u2019d say is a must-buy for hot pot. The rest of our recommendations are purely optional, though we\u2019re sharing them here because they\u2019ve made our hot-pot-making lives easier and we imagine they\u2019ll do the same for you.Electric BurnerIf you invest in only one piece of equipment, make it this\u2014the experience of hot pot is all about cooking whatever you want at the table, as you eat. You will typically come across two types of hot pot burners: butane and electric. Sze is team electric. \u201cElectric cooks more evenly, plus you won\u2019t run out of electricity like butane,\u201d Sze says. I love this Cuisinart Cast-Iron Single Burner, which is quick to heat up, pretty powerful, and easy to clean.Cuisinart Cast-Iron Single Burner$60 at AmazonDivided PotThe reason for this is simple: \u201cYou can have two broths at once, buddy! It makes life more exciting,\u201d says Sze. Assistant food editor Jessie YuChen, who worked on this story, highly recommends this stainless steel pot. It has a clear lid, so you can easily see when the broths are boiling and ready for ingredients. In a pinch, use whatever short-sided stock pot or Dutch oven you have.Stainless Steel Divided Hot Pot$43 at AmazonWire SkimmerAlong with being just so darn adorable, this nifty tool is great for keeping track of the ingredients you\u2019re cooking. Sze uses it like a fishing net. \u201cYou can put your meat or manila clam in the skimmer and take it out once you see it\u2019s at the temp you want it at,\u201d he says. No skimmer? Just use chopsticks.Brass Spider Skimmer and Strainer$9 at AmazonBack to the top.2. Let\u2019s Make Some Broths\u201cBroths are the building blocks of your hot pot,\u201d Sze says. He's shared two recipes\u2014a Mala Beef Broth inspired by Taiwanese beef noodle soup and an Herbal Mushroom Broth\u2014meant to be served side by side in a divided pot for two different but complementary experiences. \u201cYou want a spicy broth, verging on too spicy, that you can\u2019t stop eating, and another that is milder and refreshing for a little break,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou switch between the two, and that makes your palate dance.\u201d Ideally, you\u2019d make both broths, but you\u2019re still good if you go with just one.Herbal Mushroom Hot Pot BrothUmami-rich and flavorful all on its own, this vegan hot pot base is also a welcome palate cleanser when served alongside a spicy broth.View RecipeMala Beef Hot Pot BrothThis fiery red broth is a labor of love, but it\u2019s worth it\u2014your hot pot spread depends on a rich, flavorful base.View RecipeAll that said, hot pot is what you want it to be, so there is zero judgment if you don\u2019t have the time or energy to make your own broth. These store-bought broth bases come either in powder or sauce form, but either way, you add them to water or stock and bring to a simmer. Here are the ones we reach for in a pinch.Fly By Jing Fire Hot Pot BaseIf nose-clearing, tongue-tingling spice is your thing, this Sichuan-peppercorn-infused broth is for you. \u201cIt\u2019s really pepper-centric and you can taste the quality of the red chile peppers,\u201d Sze says.Fire Hot Pot Base$20 at Fly By JingHaidilao Hot Pot Seasoning\u201cIt tastes like Chinese medicine, herbal and clean,\u201d Sze explains. Which, for the record, is a high compliment.Haidilao Hot Pot Soup Base$4 at Weee!Little Sheep Mushroom Soup BaseMy personal recommendation, this makes a ridiculously umami-rich broth that\u2019s great with a veg-forward hot pot spread; it imbues Napa cabbage and 'shrooms with a savory-sweet flavor.Little Sheep Hot Pot Soup Base Mushroom Flavor$10 at WalmartBack to the top.3. Now, The Fun Stuff: The SpreadThe key to hot pot lies in the variety of your spread. You want a rich and salty moment to linger on your tastebuds, a fatty and chewy moment for body, a fresh and crunchy moment to reset your palate, and a starchy moment to bring it all together and finish out the meal. The way Sze ensures his hot pot hits all those notes is by following a seemingly strict but actually quite flexible categorization of inclusions: protein, seafood, leafy veg, hardy veg, mushrooms, accessories (more on those later!), and starch.This is a lot of ingredients, so a word of advice: \u201cPick one ingredient from each category,\u201d Sze says. \u201cHot pot is a really simple way to just eat whatever the hell you want and tailor it to your needs.\u201d Since all of the ingredients start out raw, you can easily repurpose leftovers into other dishes the next day.Here, he breaks down each category, along with his tips for prepping and cooking.Photograph by Jenny Huang, Food styling by Tyna Hoang, Prop styling by Nicole LouieProteinMeat does double duty in the hot pot, \u201csince broth takes on [its] flavors,\u201d according to Sze.Beef short ribs: Sze\u2019s cut of choice (it\u2019s pure nostalgia)Prep: Par-freeze to firm up, trim off the silver skin (connective tissue), and cut against the grain in thin slices or cubesCook time: About 15 seconds for slices and up to 30 minutes for cubes, which is good for forgetful eatersPresliced fatty beef: Usually brisket or chuck, which can be found in the refrigerated or freezer section of most Asian supermarketsPrep: Thaw, if frozenCook time: 8 seconds (which is about when this quick-cooking meat hits medium), but up to 1 minute depending on your preference. Cook it the way you like your steakLeg of lamb: A study in textures!Prep: Get the calf muscle (more uniform in terms of fat, connective tissue, and lean parts), ask your butcher to remove the bone, and slice narrowly, like the short rib.Cook time: Around 90 seconds for super tender, more cooked-through meat, though Sze likes his rare (dipped for 15 seconds)Presliced pork belly: Also found in the refrigerated or freezer section of most Asian supermarkets; it should be about a \u215b\" thickPrep: Thaw, if frozenCook time: Since it\u2019s got a lot of fat, it can really languish in the broth (10 minutes!)Photograph by Jenny Huang, Food styling by Tyna Hoang, Prop styling by Nicole LouieSeafoodBalance\u2014that\u2019s what briny shellfish brings to this hot pot spread. \u201cIt cuts through everything,\u201d Sze says.Manila clams: As they open up, they add a distinct saltiness to the brothPrep: Scrub clean and purge in water 30 minutes before cookingCook time: \u201cI babysit them,\u201d Sze admits, putting one clam in at a time and watching until it opens up, from 30 seconds to around 5 minutesShrimp: Because who doesn\u2019t like shrimp?!Prep: Sze goes with tiger shrimp, but feel free to go with your shrimp of choice. Whatever you pick, salt them, set aside for 15 minutes, then rinse. This ensures a slightly bouncy textureCook time: About 1 minute, or until the shrimp are opaque all the way throughPhotograph by Jenny Huang, Food styling by Tyna Hoang, Prop styling by Nicole LouieLeafy VegHere are a few of Sze\u2019s favorites, which you can find at many Asian grocery stores. But really, he says, \u201cAny vegetable you can think of, you can put in a hot pot.\u201dNapa cabbage: An absolute flavor spongePrep: Pull the leaves from the head and cut vertically into three long slices. \u201cIt\u2019s really pretty-looking and also easier to pick up with your chopsticks,\u201d Sze shares.Cook time: 10 minutes, so it\u2019s soft and bursting with brothy flavorChrysanthemum greens: Herbal flavor and fresh texture to fight palate fatiguePrep: Rinse once more!\u00a0Cook time: No more than 3\u20134 minutes\u2014you want textural contrastYu choy: A perfect mix of crunchy and squishyPrep: Chop off the roots and cut stalks into thirdsCooking time: 30 seconds for the stalkier portions, to maintain the texture, and a few seconds for the leafier partsHardy VegThink of these ingredients as the buried treasure of the hot pot spread. \u201cThey hold up really well in the broth, so it\u2019s like a treat for yourself in the future,\u201d Sze says.Mountain yam: For a juicy, sandy texture similar to a Korean pearPrep: Peel and cut into 3\" sticks, like a steak fry.Cook time: No more than 3 minutes.Taro: Creamy!Prep: Peel and cut into \u00bd\" slices or big 1 \u00bd\" chunks. Whichever route you go, be sure to soak the taro in water for 5 minutes to wash off excess starch, which can thicken the broths.Cook time: About 1 minute for the slices or 10 minutes for the chunks for a tender biteLotus root: For a much-needed burst of crunchPrep: Peel and cut into \u00bd\"-thick roundsCook time: 5\u201310 minutesCeltuce: One of Sze\u2019s all-time favorite vegetablesPrep: Peel off the tough fibrous skin, then either cut into chunks or slice into wafer-thin roundsCook time: 5 minutes for the chunks, which will become tender, or 5 seconds for the rounds to keep them crisp and still sweetKabocha squash: Winter\u2019s finestPrep: Cut into thick wedges and keep the skin on\u2014it's edible and keeps the squash intact while it's cookingCook time: About 10 minutes, until it's velvety but not falling apartPotato: Russets, for solid structure that won\u2019t dissolve in the brothPrep: Slice into thin rounds, which will cook fast and won\u2019t add too much starch to the brothCook time: 10\u201315 secondsPhotograph by Jenny Huang, Food styling by Tyna Hoang, Prop styling by Nicole LouieMushroomsA variety of textures and flavors is the name of the hot pot game, and that is why these funghi are crucial to Sze\u2019s hot pot spread. \u201cThey have a very grassy flavor and bring a chewy, meaty moment,\u201d he says. They\u2019re also a great meat sub, so vegetarians, load up.Enoki and beech mushrooms: Bundles of bouncy joyPrep: Chop off the roots and pull apart into smaller clumpsCook time: 10 minutes or soShiitake: Like meat, fresh shiitake impart umami into the broth as they cookPrep: Pop them in whole, for vanity. \u201cIt just looks better,\u201d Sze saysCook time: At least 10 minutes to cook them through, but as long as 30 minutes if you want to season the brothKing oyster: \u201cThe most meat-like sub for when you\u2019re greased out from the meat, or if you\u2019re vegetarian,\u201d Sze declaresPrep: Cut into 1\" chunks or \u00bc\" slices.Cook time: About 6 minutes for chunks or 2\u20133 minutes for the slicesPhotograph by Jenny Huang, Food styling by Tyna Hoang, Prop styling by Nicole LouieAccessoriesHands down, the best-named category of this hot pot ingredient spread. \u201cI call them accessories because I don\u2019t think they\u2019re absolutely necessary, but if you can get them, they just make the hot pot better,\u201d says Sze.Fried bean curd rolls: Think of these as Fruit Roll-Ups but toasty and soybean-yPrep: You're off the hook for this oneCook time: 5 seconds, or \u201cas long as it takes to unravel,\u201d Sze says. \u201cOne side of it is soft and tender, the other is crunchy.\u201dFish tofu: \u201cIt\u2019s squishy but also snappy, since it\u2019s fish paste that\u2019s been whipped with a ton of air and then fried,\u201d Sze says. \u201cIt tastes like junk food.\u201dPrep: Look for these golden-yellow squares in the frozen section of any Asian supermarket.Cook time: 3 minutes or soFish balls: Made in a similar fashion as beef balls, these chewy orbs are often fried (check out the golden ones) or filled with roe (the Smurfs\u2019 hat-shaped one!)Prep: Head to the frozen section of your go-to Asian groceryCooking time: 3\u20135 minutes, or until the fish ball floats (this indicates they're cooked through)Beef ball: \u201cHow it\u2019s made is pretty poetic,\u201d Sze muses. \u201cCuts of beef that would normally be disposed of are pounded until the fibers break down and moisture is released. This turns it into a paste, which is shaped into balls. It\u2019s bouncy, meaty, and so fun to eat.\u201dPrep: Pick up any frozen ones that catch your eye at Asian supermarketsCook time: They\u2019re pre-cooked, so they just need to be warmed through in the broth, about 3 minutesFrozen tofu: Freezing it forces the water in the tofu to expand. Once it thaws, those crystals turn back to water and are drained, but the tofu retains that expanded structure. \u201cThe tofu takes on an extra spongy texture, which sucks up more broth,\u201d Sze explainsPrep: Take whatever tofu you want\u2014silken, medium, hard\u2014cut it into blocks and freeze it fully, then thaw it, and freeze it for another day before serving it at hot potCook time: 10 minutesEgg dumpling: Another nostalgic pick for Sze, and one that adds a pop of color to the spreadPrep: Found in the frozen dumpling aisle of most Asian supermarkets. Look for Sze\u2019s favorite brand, Laurel.Cook time: 5 minutesPhotograph by Jenny Huang, Food styling by Tyna Hoang, Prop styling by Nicole LouieStarchYou\u2019re already eating a ton of food, \u201cso why not add a bowl of vermicelli?\u201d Sze jokes. \u201cIt\u2019s a cultural thing, to round out your meal.\u201d But it\u2019s also the best way to fully enjoy the hot pot broths, since noodles will pick up the flavor that\u2019s been building all dinner long.Instant ramen: For the people with a well-stocked pantryPrep: Use the noodles; save the flavor packets for something else.Cook time: As little or as long as you\u2019d like, since the noodles have already been fried. \u201cYou can throw them in and boil to oblivion and they won\u2019t overcook,\u201d Sze says.Rice: To make congee, so you don\u2019t waste a bit of that precious brothPrep: Remove any lingering hot pot ingredients from the broth before adding in leftover cooked riceCook time: 10 minutes, stirring often so the congee doesn\u2019t burnGlass noodles: This is Sze\u2019s go-to starch: \u201cThey\u2019re not too heavy, they soak up the flavor best among other noodles, and they cook really fast\u201dPrep: Buy the mung bean version; compared to other noodles they have less starch, which can burn at the bottom of the potCook time: Follow package instructionsBack to the top.Photograph by Jenny Huang, Food styling by Tyna Hoang, Prop styling by Nicole Louie4. You\u2019re Prepped and Ready\u2014Now Here\u2019s How to Do ItYou\u2019ve made it. Welcome to heaven\u2019s gate, the magical moment before your hot pot extravaganza begins. You\u2019ve got some amazing tasting (and smelling) broths about to reach a boil at the table, surrounded by plates and bowls of all the ingredients you\u2019re in the mood for. Now, it\u2019s time to cook\u2014here\u2019s how:Bring the broths to a boil. Then take it down to a simmer and you\u2019re ready to dunk.Start by adding whatever takes the longest to cook (hardy veg, mushrooms) or will impart more flavor (like meats, which will make a meat broth even meatier). A word to the wise: Be prepared when adding flavor sponges (tofu, Napa cabbage) to spicy broths because they absorb heat and can become overwhelming to eat.Then it\u2019s a free for all. You\u2019ve got all the intel on how long everything should hang out in the broth, so cook whatever you want at whatever pace. Some hot pot enthusiasts might disagree with this approach, proposing that you start with meat, then veg, then starches, but Sze believes that \u201cthe whole point of hot pot is to experience different flavors and textures throughout your meal, and to have strict rules defeats the purpose.\u201d Instead, he pays close attention to each item added in order to ensure perfect cooking.And remember: Feed your friends. \u201cThere is absolute accountability and responsibility at the hot pot table,\u201d Sze explains. If you see the short ribs hit the perfect temp or the taro about to reach its crumbling point, scoop it up and drop it off at a dining companion\u2019s bowl. \u201cThis kind of etiquette is part of the communal experience of eating hot pot.\u201dBack to the top.5. But What About the Condiments?Sze believes the broth is the only flavoring agent you need, but for some folks, condiments are essential to the meal. Many hot pot restaurants have a salad bar-esque set-up (I create a similar buffet at home!), where you can build your own bowl of chopped aromatics (scallions, garlic, cilantro), sauces (soy, peanut, sesame), vinegar, oils, and seasonings (sacha, chile flakes) to stir together and plunge your broth-cooked ingredients into before eating. So if you live to dip and drizzle, here are a few to try:Black VinegarFor a much-needed hit of acid, Sze likes this inky vinegar. He opts for Eastlake Shanxi (more savory) or Fly By Jing (slightly sweeter).Eastlake Shanxi Black Vinegar$7 at Coco Island MartSacha SauceAlso known as barbecue sauce, this aromatic seafood paste is a staple in barbecue as well as soup. Sze\u2019s go-to brand is Bull Head from Taiwan.Bull Head Sacha BBQ Sauce$12 at Umami CartSesame PasteSze likes to thin it out with soy sauce, black vinegar, and water for a dipping sauce with a balanced bite. Wang Zhihe is a fave, but tahini works in a pinch.\u00a0Wang Zhihe Pure Sesame Paste$14 at AmazonScallions, Cilantro, and GarlicMince these bad boys and sprinkle them into whatever condiments you\u2019re using to add brightness. \u201cScallion and cilantro provide freshness and counteract the fats in the meat and sesame paste, while garlic can punch through the heavier flavors,\u201d Sze says.A Final Word From the Hot Pot Nerds:\u00a0\u201cBe adventurous,\u201d Sze says. \u201cIf you live in Germany, put in some sausages. If it\u2019s springtime, add fiddlehead ferns. This spread reflects my preference for hot pot; it\u2019s not the universally accepted way to do it. Whatever you like, try it. Hot pot is a blank canvas, and you can go in so many different directions.\u201d\u00a0In other words, you got this.Explore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
