If you can\u2019t find either, you can roughly substitute with a pinch each of onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, kosher salt, and freshly ground black pepper. This recipe from lawyer, policy advocate, and writer Maya Harris is inspired by her family friend Regina Shelton.

Turned out very good. Followed recipe except used tomato soup and 1/4 water in place of tomato sauce. Also added a fresh tomato. I don\u2019t think you can go wrong with this recipe. Good proportions and flavor. Schmee Kalamazoo, MI10/3/2021Just here to cringe at Orlando becky feeling the need to mention her bf's ethnicity MarieMontreal7/29/2021My wife proclaimed this recipe to be company worthy.  My only changes were to saut\u00e9 the shrimp and andouille separately first then removed them and added them back in at the recommended times.  This gave them a better texture than cooking them in with the trinity.  I ad to use frozen okra, but it still turned out very good.TongsPhilly area5/17/2021Any idea what I could substitute for the okra?\nSandy90265Malibu, CA3/6/2021This is pretty much just jambalaya....AnonymousUnited Arab Emirates 2/17/2021If you add a teaspoon of white vinegar, the okra won\u2019t be slimy. Anonymous2/17/2021Does this use spaghetti sauce or tomato puree for the tomato sauce.  thanks.PDX cookPortland, OR2/17/2021Super easy, but the various ingredients need tune to cook down, so save yourself a solid hour. Otherwise it was incredibly easy to throw together. My Indian boyfriend is a notoriously picky eater and he loaded his plate three times and ate himself into a food coma on this. Without knowing him, you don\u2019t know what a high degree of recommendation this is.
