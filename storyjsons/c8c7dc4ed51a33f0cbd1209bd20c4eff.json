It\u2019s the only non-donut item on the menu, so you know it\u2019s gotta be good.My love of eggs has been long and unwavering. I grew up in New York City where the bodega egg and cheese breakfast sandwich is a classic\u2014on a Kaiser roll, of course. That goes back to my childhood. The egg and cheese is also, as you go through your college years, a great hangover helper. Hangovers are not exclusive to New York, but nonetheless.When it comes to the version we do at Du\u2019s, I was imagining a way to make the egg and cheese that would hit all the notes the classic had for me over the years, but in our own voice. We wanted it to be reminiscent of comfort food, but over deliver by hitting the texture and flavor out of the park. This sandwich is delicious first and foremost, but it\u2019s also playful and fun. And you don\u2019t need to have the NYC egg and cheese in your memory bank for it to work.Just look at that cheese oozing out.\nPhoto by Alex LauAt a bodega, the eggs are basically a folded omelet. But I\u2019ve always loved scrambled eggs, too, so in our version we lean towards that.  I was trained in the classic French style, which is to start the pan over very low heat and whisk for a long period of time until tiny curds form. But that method produces eggs so soft they\u2019d be a mess in an egg sandwich.Instead I whisk them from beginning to end so I still get smaller curds but cook them quickly over high heat so they\u2019re firmer and don\u2019t come spilling out of the bread.  Whisking constantly is key. Large chunks or curd of scrambled egg make me think of an unfortunate hotel steam table. The smaller the curd, the more compelling the scrambled egg becomes.When the eggs are scrambled, remove them from the heat and whisk in cream cheese, which ensures they\u2019re incredibly creamy. Cream cheese is a miracle ingredient.To assemble the sandwiches, divide American cheese between 2 slices of bread and top with the creamy scrambled egg mixture. Close the sandwiches, and toast them on a buttered skillet until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side, as you would grilled cheese.Get the recipe:Wylie Dufresne\u2019s Scrambled Egg SandwichAdding cream cheese makes them EXTRA creamy.
