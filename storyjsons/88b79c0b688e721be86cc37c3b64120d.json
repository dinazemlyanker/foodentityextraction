Let's find out.By Alex BeggsApril 13, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensFacebookTwitterEmailEvery Friday morning, Bon App\u00e9tit senior staff writer Alex Beggs shares weekly highlights from the BA offices, from awesome new recipes to office drama to restaurant recs, with some weird (food!) stuff she saw on the internet thrown in. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you\u2019ll see it before everyone else.Self-fulfilling propheciesThis week, I found out that a majority of the Bon App\u00e9tit staff foretold their own futures. When Rachel Karten was in second grade, she wrote her first recipe...for a martini. (See above.) And while she spelled \u201cBeefeater\u201d wrong, I\u2019m impressed at the generous three olives. Clearly, Little Rachel was destined for great things! Then I read an unnamed, embarrassed Test Kitchen editor\u2019s college thesis on 17th century cookery books in England, which was\u2014at times\u2014fascinating. \u201cI wrote a report in 7th grade about how the best dinner was Campbell's cream of chicken soup,\u201d said Hilary Cadigan, arbiter of good taste. For a feature writing class, Christina Chaey interviewed a former BA food editor! Anna Stockwell made a recipe book with her Czech host mother when she was an exchange student in Prague. Aliza Abarbanel wrote a paper on the rise of tea in Britain and how tea shops provided a \u201cthird space\u201d for the exchange of ideas. Emily Schultz photographed and produced her own food magazine, blatantly recreating a BA feature on toast. As you might have guessed, Amiel Stanek wrote his thesis on \u201con the intertextuality of recipes,\u201d lol. (Amiel: \u201cThere is no original recipe! Every text is shot through with references to other texts!\u201d) Before that, he made a magazine about cooking organ meat, called Gutsy. And me? Well..Peden + MunkWhat\u2019s Jesse cooking?Last weekend, Jesse Sparks made Claire Saffitz\u2019s babkallah (hybrid challah x babka). I always thought that was an intimidating recipe, but \u201cit was incredibly simple, approachable, and definitely boosted my baking confidence,\u201d said Jesse.Get the recipe: Chocolate-Cinnamon \u201cBabkallah\u201dHave you pre-orderedIndian-ish, yet? If you\u2019re in the New York area, I hope to run into you at Priya\u2019s dinner at Bombay Bread Bar (her mom Ritu will be cooking too!!). There are more great dinners\u2014all over the country\u2014if that one sells out by the time you read this. (Here\u2019s the full book tour.) If I still lived in Houston, I wouldn\u2019t miss the event at Chris Shepherd\u2019s UB Preserv. And a final if: If she isn\u2019t coming to your town at all, guess you\u2019ll have to host an Indian-ish cookbook club!Buy it: Indian-ish: Recipes and Antics from a Modern American Family, $19 on amazon.comY thoWhat\u2019s the point of inventing a start-up, making beaucoup bucks, and then...not spend all of it eating lobster for breakfast, Wagyu steak for lunch, and Roberta\u2019s frozen pizza for dinner? Twitter founder Jack Dorsey revealed on a podcast this week that he eats one meal a day and fasts all weekend. I guess the character limit on Twitter makes more sense, in this context. Dude likes limits. I like lunch.Elizabeth CecilSpeaking of lunchAmiel Stanek said he made boiled potatoes with green goddess dressing recently and it brought him joy/happiness/fulfillment. OF COURSE IT DID. It\u2019s green goddess season, folks! What have you done to bring this creamy, anchovy-y, herby dressing into your life? NOT ENOUGH.Use this recipe and dream big: Little Gem Lettuce with Green Goddess DressingHave you heard?Hold onto your butts, there\u2019s a new \u201cit\u201d vegetable in town!!! \u201cMove over cauliflower and broccoli! Caulilini is the new \u2018it\u2019 vegetable with stems like broccoli, florets lacier than cauliflower and even pretty enough to put in a vase,\u201d began a press release that Emma Fishman forwarded me this week, knowing very well how important it is for me to be on top of the food trends\u2014in case I ever get picked up by the Cash Cab. Caullini, a brassica with a registered trademark, looks like pale broccoli with yellow buds. It is my understanding that it is \u201cinsta-worthy.\u201d It seems fine!Unnecessary food meme of the weekPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate BuckensUnnecessary food feud of the weekOur hotly debated new matzo ball soup recipe brought out the staff\u2019s deep-seated issues with carrots. Carrot coins = good. Mushy carrots = bad. Baby carrots = unspeakable. \u201cWhy are people hypnotized by this vegetable?!\u201d fumed Amiel. \u201cIf I see another menu with roasted carrots on yogurt with some seedy BS on top, I\u2019m going to scream.\u201d \u201cI like them nice and burnt,\u201d countered Meryl Rothstein. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be the star,\u201d said Christina Chaey, \u201cbut I like huge hunks of carrots, inappropriately soft, in a braise or pot pie.\u201d \u201cWhy are we doing this again?\u201d whined Molly. \u201cI only put them in the matzo ball soup out of nostalgia. Okay? And those carrot coins are perfectly cooked, I might add.\u201d Ryan Walker-Hartshorn told me that raw carrots give her an allergic reaction that makes her throat nearly close up...but she likes them so much she eats them with hummus all the time, tempting fate. (Worrisome, Ry!!) Gaby Melian told me a true tale: When she sold a table recently, it was picked up by a psychic medium who petted Gaby\u2019s dog and said, \"He\u2019s telling me he loves carrots.\" And she was right! Gaby\u2019s dog loves raw carrots!! In the corner of the conference room, a certain vegetarian was suspiciously silent. Sarah Jampel, confess! She burst out: \u201cSOMETIMES I EAT BABY CARROTS HERE JUST AS AN ACT OF REBELLION!\u201dGahhhhhhhhh!Get your sweet beta-C\u2019s this weekend,Alex BeggsSenior Staff WriterExplore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecultureIs It Ever Okay...To Call Out a Mansplaining Waiter?By Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
