Jarred red curry paste is the star of the show, lending the ground chicken mixture all the complexity of aromatics like lemongrass, garlic, coriander root, and shallot without a whole lot of chopping.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

The curry-spiced chicken worked well with the dates. I also cooked up some sticky rice to temper the spice heat and add a bit of bulk. I used the endive leaves to scoop and eat the mix. For slight modifications, I used torn basil leaves rather than mint and slivered almonds. Note that every Thai curry paste is a bit different. Add the paste, pepper flakes, and salt to taste. As a small matter, I found the phrase 'arrange the chicken' somewhat strange for ground meat (as opposed to chicken pieces). Spread, right?Eric W.Durham, NC3/16/2022This recipe is so quick and so delicious.  I am making it again tonight for dinner....only adding more endive and a little more heat.PauletteVirginia3/9/2022Delicious.
