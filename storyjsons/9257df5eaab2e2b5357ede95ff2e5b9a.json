Chef Rick Easton constantly changes up the pizzas. One minute it\u2019s a very simple Margherita, with tangy tomatoes and a glug of olive oil. The next, lardo drizzled with honey and crunchy, toasty hazelnuts. The reason why the menu never stays the same is because Easton\u2019s super focused on seasonal ingredients. But it\u2019s also because he doesn\u2019t have a big kitchen with tons of space to prep.The restaurant is simple yet inviting, with a garage door that\u2019s rolled up during warmer months and a big line that goes out the door\u2014go during the weekdays to avoid it! Sometimes, you\u2019ll wait 30 minutes just to get to the counter, but I don\u2019t mind one bit. That\u2019s partically because Bread and Salt is BYOB and I start drinking the minute I\u2019m in line. But it\u2019s mostly because it\u2019s worth the wait. The pizzas here are so special: thin and rectangular, they\u2019re all made with quality ingredients, and you can really tell. You\u2019ll eat four slices without even noticing.With the weather the way it is, I\u2019d take a artichoke, onion, and potato pie at any moment, but I\u2019m also counting down the days until the zucchini and stracciatella returns, which tastes like summer in Italy.\nThat said, I don\u2019t even bother reading the menu before I order. I just get whatever Easton brings out of the oven, like I\u2019m at some kind of pizza omakase.Go there: Bread and SaltExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsNew JerseyPizzaRead MorerestaurantsI Haven\u2019t Had a Just-Okay Dish at This Little Italian Spot in New JerseyBy Brad LeoneRecipes you want to make.
