Next up: How to make canned soup better\u2014super, even.There was a yearlong phase in my life where all I would eat for lunch was canned soup. I was starting a food business and had no time and even less money. Every day I would open a can, toddle over to the microwave, and pull my trusty bag of chopped herbs, spices, and miscellaneous cheeses out of the fridge\u2014as my coworkers silently wondered if I was finally losing it. I knew what they didn\u2019t: Like a blank canvas, a can of soup is full of infinite possibility. Ever since, those deeply misunderstood tins have held a warm place in my heart.At least half of you reading this probably disagree with that sentiment. \u201cCanned soup\u201d are two objectively benign words that nonetheless tend to create division in just about any group. Some people ( \ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) adore them for their convenience and versatility, while others lob critiques that are decidedly not appropriate for the internet. Okay, I\u2019ll admit: A lot of the dusty tins you find on grocery store shelves are a little, well, lackluster. But even if I\u2019d opt for a brothy, homemade chowder or a hearty vegetarian ramen most of the time, canned soups are an affordable, faster-to-prepare option. Canned soup, like life, is what you make it.All you need to prepare a steaming bowl of soup that rivals the homemade stuff, is a few key ingredients and a can-do attitude. Here\u2019s how to make canned soup (and maybe your life?) better.Start with an aromatic basePretty much every can of soup already contains aromatics. But to put some pep back in your soup\u2019s step, you\u2019re going to want to add more. Start by saut\u00e9ing any combination of finely chopped vegetables and alliums\u2014like onion, garlic, carrots, celery, bell peppers, and ginger. Whatever you choose is going to infuse the entire can of soup you\u2019re about to heat. A shorter saut\u00e9 will result in a sweeter, less potent base, whereas a longer cook will brown your ingredients for a deeper, more savory vibe.All out of alliums? An aromatic base can also be achieved with sturdy herbs, spices, or condiments. Enliven plain (and thin) soups by blooming a combination in oil before heating. Sizzle a pinch of Madras curry powder, garam masala, equal parts ground cumin and smoked paprika, or a sprig of rosemary in your saucepan, then add butternut squash soup. Thyme, crushed red pepper flakes, and bay leaves work well with mushroom soup. And a can of tomato soup is practically begging to begin with a scoop of saut\u00e9ed red curry paste or harissa or a sprinkle of dried oregano and basil.Dilute, dilute, diluteChunkier soups, like black bean or lentil, tend to lean thick\u2014and, it must be said, gloopy. To thin them out (and dial down the intense salinity), add more water or low-sodium stock while they\u2019re heating. (If you overdo it, don\u2019t stress: Continue simmering until the liquid has reduced to your desired consistency.) For virtually anything but the brothy bois, like chicken noodle soup or Italian minestrone, you could also stir in some coconut milk, warmed cream, or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche to add body and richness.Behold your blenderWhen making her hammy chickpea soup, recipe developer and author Carla Lalli Music pur\u00e9es half for a best-of-both-worlds situation: creamy (without the dairy!) and chunky at the same time. Your thicker, bean- or veggie-based canned soups will benefit from the same treatment.Once hot, pour half the contents of your saucepan (being sure to include some liquid), into your blender. Whiz that up until it\u2019s velvety, like a bisque, and then stir back into the saucepan. (Or use an immersion blender\u2014no transferring necessary.)\u00a0Or take things to the next level by adding a dollop of umami-rich miso\u2014or a scoop of nut or seed butter, leftover mashed potatoes, or steamed cauliflower\u2014before blending for an even creamier, more flavorful base.Go big on the greensSenior cooking editor Sarah Jampel loves adding a heck-load of greens to her soups. In her lemony tortellini number, a whole bunch of mature spinach gets thrown in. It\u2019s a strategy that works for the canned variety too: For some added vibrancy (and, sure, health!) wilt in a few handfuls of fresh or frozen kale, spinach, or Swiss chard. Frozen peas and leftover roasted broccoli or sweet potatoes are also welcome at the party.Lean into the extrasLasagna has meat. A sandwich has bread. Soup, bless its heart, skews a little on the unsatisfying side. To turn what is essentially liquid and fiber into a full-blown meal, add cooked rice, pasta, farro, quinoa, or any grain that, as my astrologer would say, \u201cspeaks to you.\u201d Beware: Grains take on liquid, so you might need to add additional water if you go this route.Or take the protein path. For a filling and aesthetically pleasing lunch, boil an egg and serve it, halved, on top. Or brown some quality sausage or bacon before heating your soup. Or stir in some shredded rotisserie chicken for extra heft.Add some acidFood director Chris Morocco\u2019s Creamy-ish of Mushroom Soup relies on dry white wine for a rich, tangy vibe\u2014and there\u2019s probably a leftover guzzle for the chef. Smart! Canned soup-ers can follow suit: After saut\u00e9ing your aromatics, deglaze the pan with a glug of the Good Juice. You can also stir a splash of acid\u2014like lemon juice, white wine vinegar, or apple cider vinegar\u2014to brighten things up.Top it all offI gotta be honest: Even after all the effort spent coaxing max flavor out of my canned soups, deciding what goes on top is still the funnest part. Add swirls of pesto, chili crisp, hot sauce, sour cream, or salted yogurt. Garnish your bowl with fried shallots, garlic chips, croutons, or a mish-mash of toasted seeds. Douse tender, fresh herbs\u2014like cilantro, dill, parsley, or basil\u2014in good-quality olive oil and vinegar and pile them on top. Crumble feta or grate Parmesan with abandon. Crush up a handful of pita, potato, or corn chips and sprinkle them over everything. Fry a grilled cheese sandwich and do with it what you know you should.Show canned soups some love, and they\u2019ll be there\u2014like little beacons of hope and tin-coated-steel\u2014when you need them most.Explore Bon App\u00e9titcookingCheap TricksRecipes you want to make.
