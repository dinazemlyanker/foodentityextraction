I had just been on stage along with a few fellow contributors to New Daughters of Africa: An International Anthology of Writing by Women of African Descent. Our panel represented the rich diversity of the landmark anthology\u2014a spicy mix of writers of different literary genres, generations, and nationalities, brought together in a place with its own complicated racial history. On the panel, I had spoken about Toni Morrison. Now, standing in the foyer of the District Six Museum, surrounded by festival attendees, this question surprises and delights me.April 15, 2017\u2014Grand View-on-Hudson, Rockland County, New YorkNadine, Toni Morrison\u2019s housekeeper, opens the door and lets us in. Morrison is not yet ready to receive us, so we wait upstairs in the living room, where Morrison has said, \u201cmake yourselves at home.\u201d Nadine is in the kitchen chopping vegetables. Soon, there\u2019s a loud sizzle and I catch the sharp bite of onion and peppers, turning sweet as they fry. I can smell tomato in there, too. It smells like home, like jollof. Back in Nigeria, we used to eat jollof on Sundays, after church services, and when celebrating Eid with friends at the end of Ramadan. The best part, if you could get to it, were the crackly bits of rice stuck to the bottom of the pan. Jollof is both everyday and party food, but no celebration is complete without it and when served with fried plantains, it\u2019s heaven. \u201cFish,\u201d says Nadine, when I walk over to ask what she\u2019s preparing. \u201cSomething healthy for Mrs. Morrison,\u201d she adds, her words lightly seasoned with the flavor of Jamaica.The aroma has me thinking about the one-pot dishes Morrison writes about in her works\u2014a pot of turnips or maws\u2014often simple, meager meals to stave off hunger or to soothe. And fish . . . I remember the \u201ccrisp sea bass\u201d with its \u201ctiny flakes of white\u201d in Miss Marie\u2019s daydreaming of a meal shared with a past love. I remember the precious piece of eel that ferryman Stamp Paid feeds Sethe in her escape from slavery. And what jollofing on the page when Morrison uses food in the naming of her characters\u2014Plum, Meringue Pie, Sweetness, Chicken and Pie, and Milkman\u2014or in describing skin tones from cream to licorice, lemonade, milk, and whey. And there is something about berries\u2014the temptation of them, as in a deep-dish berry cobbler, toppled by inquisitively hungry children, or those other berries that \u201ctasted like church\u201d\u2014\u201cjust one of those berries and you felt anointed\u201d\u2014delivered to one who is so close to being free of her slave masters. And when Morrison uses food as metaphor for sex, she\u2019s at her tantalizing best. From the sexual suggestiveness in the eating of an ear of corn: \u201cHow loose the silk. How fine and loose and free,\u201d to a woman\u2019s naked body \u201cmoist and crumbly as unbleached sugar,\u201d Morrison\u2019s word work is sublime. Every mention of food hints at a longing that simmers just beneath the surface.Nadine cuts short my reverie; Mrs. Morrison is now ready. As we walk downstairs to her study, the smell of lunch accompanies us. She says to call her Toni, and in turn she calls us her friends, which feels so warm and delicious.It\u2019s Easter Saturday, and Toni\u2019s friends and family drop by unannounced, just as I remembered it from my childhood. No invitations, but you never arrived empty-handed. We would take cakes, fruits, or vegetables when visiting. \u201cWhadya bring me?\u201d Toni teases her son, Ford, who is the first to arrive. \u201cA sam-wich?\u201d she asks. Not a sandwich, he says, but books. Something to satisfy a different hunger. Toni\u2019s neighbor Ned is the next to arrive, bearing an eye-popping floral arrangement as large as his hug. After an exchange of pleasantries, Toni asks Ned if he might bring her some food from his brother\u2019s restaurant.\u201cSeafood? You want seafood with pasta?\u201d Ned is happy to oblige.\u201cYes!\u201d says Toni.\u201cOkay. Some pasta, some seafood?\u201d\u201cYes, yes, yes!\u201d Toni enthuses.\u201cAnd a little dessert?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cJust for one? You\u2019re not having a dinner party, are you?\u201d Ned checks.And here is where I join in, playfully suggesting that we stay for dinner. I tell her I had planned on bringing a chocolate cake. \u201cHey!\u201d says Toni with excitement at the mention of cake. \u201cWhadya-do!\u201d she adds, feigning indignation, when I confess to only having brought chocolates.August 6, 2019\u2014Peckham, LondonOn the day Toni Morrison dies, I am in London. When I hear the news, I immediately set out on a walk, looking for a quiet place to process the shock. I find a church and sit outside on an empty bench. At the foot of the bench, I see a slice of fried plantain. Two days earlier, friends and I had shared jollof rice and plantain from a nearby Nigerian takeout, I Go Chop. Perhaps the plantain came from there and here it lies like an offering\u2014a libation for the ancestors. I close my eyes and return to that afternoon when we had jollofed at Toni\u2019s house, which had smelled, quite simply, of home.Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
