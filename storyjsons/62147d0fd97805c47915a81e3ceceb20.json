That\u2019s right\u2014unlimited cornichons! L\u2019Express has been open since 1980; this place knows what it\u2019s doing and it does it well.ORDER THE: steak tartare, a no-frills version that\u2019s minced finely and served with (not quite enough) toast. Then get whatever the slightly gruff waiter recommends.THE VIBE IS: sparse but not without character\u2014black-and-white tile floors, the occasional palm tree, and somewhat dim lighting except for the courtyard area in the back. The waiters are most definitely wearing vests. This is the kind of place where you mean to get one cocktail but end up staying for a bottle of wine.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day: Monday to Friday 8 a.m. to 3 a.m., Saturday 10 a.m. to 3 a.m., and Sunday 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. So yeah, about that bottle of wine...\u2014Carey PolisPhoto by Dominique LafondPhoto by Dominique LafondWE ALSO LOVEAu Pied de CochonGet your fill of foie gras and other Quebecois luxuries at this Plateau legendPatisserie Au Kouign-AmannA carby, sugary haven in the PlateauSchwartz\u2019sA must-visit sandwich institution still slinging smoked meat in the PlateauExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
