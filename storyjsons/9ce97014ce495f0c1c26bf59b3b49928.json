From conglomerates to craft breweries, there\u2019s often only one woman in the room. Or none! And yet women purchase and consume almost as much alcohol as men. So I knew I wanted to create a product for women, one that\u2019s as easy to drink as wine. Just chill and serve. But here\u2019s the thing: I did it without quitting my day job. I still work full-time as a corporate lawyer. Because there are financial realities to living in New York City. And even with a great product, it can take time to see a financial return. By 2015, Empower Cocktails\u2019 first drink was on store shelves: a Cosmopolitan Martini made from sweet potato vodka, white cranberry, triple sec, and lime. As for the name, I always thought it would feel fantastic to walk into a bar and order \u201ca glass of empower.\u201d Six years later, I still feel the magic when I see the bottle on shelves.Tiffany\u2019s Best AdvicePick a path that works for you. People stereotype successful entrepreneurs: put everything in, risk it all, don\u2019t look back. But you don\u2019t have to do it that way. I still work full-time as a corporate lawyer. I have a number of aspirations, and Empower Cocktails is one of them. My entrepreneur journey has been beneficial to my corporate journey and vice versa. I make better decisions in both places.Get specific about costs. How much money you need to get started varies wildly. Research to get specific numbers for your product. Lawyer fees, shipping costs, marketing. Someone to manufacture your product. You might have to buy bottle caps and labels. Or boxes. This gets costly fast. Know that production houses of all kinds have minimums. You can\u2019t say \u201ccan you make just 10 bottles of something so I can test it out.\u201dYour network is gold. Your own personal and professional network is your most valuable resource. These are people who will be helpful to you at no cost. Find out what and who they know.Don\u2019t be afraid of feedback. You can\u2019t create a product with mass appeal all on your own. If you\u2019re doing it all by yourself and taking no one else\u2019s feedback into account, that\u2019s called a hobby.Savor and share your success. Channel all your good feelings back to your customers. Positive engagement matters, and it\u2019s exciting for people to meet a female founder. Women sip my cosmos and ask who I work for. Their eyes light up when I say \u201cmyself.\u201dRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works. Restaurant recommendations you trust.FacebookTwitterPinterestInstagramYouTubeMore from Bon App\u00e9titMastheadNewsletter SignupBon App\u00e9tit Media KitContactSubscription FAQsCareersRSS FeedsSite MapAccessibility HelpCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCond\u00e9 Nast SpotlightDo Not Sell My Personal Info\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
