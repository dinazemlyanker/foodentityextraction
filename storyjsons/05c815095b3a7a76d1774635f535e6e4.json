I\u2019m well acquainted with avo, though I prefer a smear of ricotta and orange jam for breakfast these days. I make a regular pilgrimage to Hart\u2019s for their clam toast, and don\u2019t get me started on this caramelized leek number from Botanica\u2014I\u2019ve made it too often to count. But tomato toast? Never met the guy.Until Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s August Simple Issue came out, and I came face to face with this gorgeous photo of hyper-red and juicy tomatoes resting on a cloud-like swipe of mayo all on top of crisp, olive-oil-soaked bread. Oh, hi, hello there, I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve been introduced.The full photo has a nice can of cold Modelo in it. Equally enticing.\nPhoto by Marcus Nilsson, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Amy WilsonThe recipe, by senior food editor Andy Baraghani, is hardly a recipe at all. (We called it the \u201cSimple Issue\u201d for a reason.) You toast some bread, stir mayo with a little grated garlic and lemon juice, and thinly slice a few tomatoes. Then come the garnishes, and there are  A LOT. Here at BA, we call this kind of garnish frenzy \u201cpeak Andy.\u201d You\u2019ve got\u2014wait for it\u2014sesame seeds, minced chives, flaky salt, cracked pepper, Aleppo-style pepper, olive oil, and lemon zest. Roll your eyes all you want, but it makes for one good-looking toast (actually, four toasts). I forgot the lemon zest, and it was still the most-liked photo I\u2019ve ever put on the internet. [Note from Andy: \u201cShe should really have gone for the lemon zest.\u201d]Exhibit A:Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Oh, and they\u2019re incredible. I served these guys for a family brunch alongside a platter of scrambled eggs with Swiss chard. The tomatoes\u2019 sweet acidity played off the garlicky mayo, which softened right into the still-warm bread. The sesame seeds lent subtle crunch; the Aleppo pepper gave the slightest suggestion of heat. If you\u2019re not into the idea of mayo and tomato juice dripping down your wrists, you\u2019ll want to grab a fork and knife for this one. But then I have to ask, what kind of summer eater are you?Get the recipe before summer\u2019s over:Tomato Toast with Chives and Sesame SeedsSprinkle the chives, sesame seeds, and flaky salt with abandon.View RecipeHonestly, this couscous is the real \u201cpeak Andy\u201d:Explore Bon App\u00e9titTomatoToastSummerWeeknightRead MorecookingIt\u2019s Called TOTES Toast: Tuna, Olives, Tomato, Eggs, ShallotBy Emily SchultzRecipes you want to make.
