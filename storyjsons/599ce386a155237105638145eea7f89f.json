It was four months before my wedding and obviously I needed to look really friggin\u2019 good in my two-piece, crop-top wedding dress. I\u2019m not usually one to impose restrictions on what I\u2019m eating (I\u2019m just not about that life; okay, maybe I\u2019m just not that good at that life\u2014whatever!), but in this case I was willing to choose something a bit more wholesome than the Dipsy Doodles I usually snack on.It was baker Hedvig Bourbon\u2019s nutritious mix of rye flour and seeds (pumpkin, sesame, sunflower, and flax) that first caught my eye\u2014lots of fiber and healthy fats; no white flour, and definitely nothing fried. But then I tried one, and all my well-intentioned motivations became way beside the point: These crackers turned out to be outrageously tasty.Crispy, crunchy, seedy heaven.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigSturdy and versatile enough to hold up to whatever I schmeared on them (labneh! nut butter! pat\u00e9!) or dipped them into (hummus! tomato soup! tzatziki!), I started eating them with anything and everything I could find. And when there was nothing, there was Knekkebrod on its own. Salty, earthy, nutty and crisp as hell, it\u2019s not for nothin\u2019 that the Norwegians call \u2018em crisp breads. They were so good, they edged their way into my regular rotation of snicky-snacks, and have stayed there ever since.Years later, my days of virtuous eating are long behind me, but my love for these addictive crackers is forever.Buy it: Norwegian Baked Knekkebr\u00f8d 2-Bag Sampler, $20 on EtsyExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendShoppingRecipes you want to make.
