Wait, chaider? Yes, it's a hot apple cider and masala chai mash-up, and it's one of the coziest drinks we've had in ages.We first noticed chaider at spots like Baked & Wired in D.C. and Joe Coffee in NYC, but unlike pumpkin spice, this is a seasonal flavor we continue to crave well into winter. Our version starts by combining apple cider with a fragrant mix of cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and peppercorns. Once the chai spices have been infused, black tea bags are added and allowed to steep for several minutes. The final mixture is strained and served with a pat of ghee or coconut oil on top\u2014a next-level move added during recipe development by senior associate food editor Molly Baz. Think of it as a spicy, wintery alternative to bulletproof coffee\u2014that emulsified, butter-coffee mixture popular with keto diet devotees for purportedly boosting energy and keeping you full all morning.\u201cThe fat is optional, but it coats your stomach and kind of acts like a way to turbocharge your morning,\u201d says Baz. \u201cThe ghee is super nutty and yummy in it, and the flavor really rounds out the sweetness of the apple cider and the spices in the tea.\u201d Add the moderate caffeine boost from those black tea bags, and you\u2019ve got the perfect combination to start out the day.This chaider can be kept in the fridge for up to five days, so we recommend making a big batch on Monday and sipping all week long. When you're ready for a cup, just gently reheat a portion in a small saucepan over medium heat and let your kitchen fill with the smell of warm apple and spice. February's suddenly looking a little lot more doable.Prepare to steep:ChaiderThis chaider recipe is our warm, spiced-up, wintery alternative to bulletproof coffee. It\u2019s a sweet mash-up of masala chai flavors and mulled cider, with an unexpected buttery finish to smooth it all out.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHot DrinkWinterChaiApple CiderRead MoreLifestyleThese Espresso-Free Lattes Will Make You Cheat On Your Morning CoffeeBy Alyse WhitneyRecipes you want to make.
