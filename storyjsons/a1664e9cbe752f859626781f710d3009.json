And guess what? I LOVE IT. It means spring is here, there\u2019s more day time for naturally-lit photos, and more stuff at the farmers market than cold potatoes.Let\u2019s rewind to the pink celery though. Okay, so it\u2019s rhubarb. And instead of a galette, this spring we\u2019re making this ridiculously easy rhubarb custard cake recipe by Claire Saffitz.Photo by Alex LauWhat...even is rhubarb though? I\u2019m explaining this because when I baked the cake this weekend, my friends asked me what rhubarb was\u2014not everyone in the world knows, and who am I to judge?  Rhubarb is in the rhizome family, along with things like turmeric and lotus root, FYI. It\u2019s a stem that grows underground and shoots roots off of it, and tastes like a sweet tart that has had all of its coloring sucked off.  When it\u2019s raw, it has the texture of celery, and when cooked it\u2019s a floppier version of that. But let\u2019s move onto the cooking portion of the show, shall we?Straight up: I don\u2019t have a fancy Kitchen-Aid mixer, and mixing by hand is HARD WORK. This recipe doesn\u2019t call for any equipment like that, so you can turn your black-and-white TV on while making this cake and reminiscence about the old days.First, we\u2019re whisking together some baking soda, kosher salt, and flour. Set that powdery bowl aside, and dump 2 eggs plus 1 egg yolk into another bowl. It\u2019s important to really whisk the eggs into an airy, frothy state because that will hold up the rhubarb later on (I didn\u2019t whisk mine enthusiastically enough and the rhubarb sank a little). Then, add 1 \u00bd cups of sugar into the eggs, and whisk those until they\u2019re well incorporated. Melt some butter and whisk that in, as well as sour cream while you\u2019re here. The combination of the extra yolk and sour cream is going to create a dreamy custard texture.At this point you might realize you bought too much sour cream and decide to make this creamy kimchi dip once the cake is done. But pull yourself out of the rabbit hole of Bon App\u00e9tit Dip slideshows and add dark rum to that cake batter to give it a mysterious warm depth of flavor (go with it). Whenever I\u2019m cooking with a liquor I don\u2019t already have at home, I\u2019ll usually just buy the teeny nips at the checkout of the liquor store, because they\u2019re cute and I won\u2019t be left with half a bottle of alcohol in the back of my freezer. (Although if you wanted to make a rum punch just because, I wouldn\u2019t hate you for it.) Zest some lemon skin into the wet batter to brighten things up, and mix to combine. Next, we\u2019ll add the dry ingredients to the wet until it\u2019s all smooth.Photo by Alex LauYour sunshiny lemon pudding batter goes into a WELL BUTTERED AND FLOURED SPRINGFORM PAN. It\u2019s an important step because the cake is custardy and delicate when it comes out of the oven, so you have to be gentle with it! If the edges stick to the pan while you\u2019re trying to release it, it\u2019ll fall apart and cause immense sadness as it reminds you of everything else broken in the world right now. But, uh, that won\u2019t happen if you remember to butter the hell out of the pan.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Once your batter has settled into its temporary springform home, it\u2019s rhubarb time! This is where we get creative, AKA pull up a photo Claire posted and try to recreate her rhubarb design exactly. Sprinkle a little bit more sugar on there, and pop it in the oven for about 40-45 minutes. During this waiting game, I made Andy Baraghani\u2019s lamb meatballs in my attempt to pretend I\u2019m a person who meal preps, and watched the episode of Jersey Shore when Vinny and Pauly go to Staten Island.Once the edges of the cake are golden brown, take it out of the oven and let it cool in the springform pan for about 10 minutes. Slide a knife around the the edge to loosen it up a bit, and once 10 minutes have passed you can release your masterpiece!Eat it with freshly whipped-whipped cream, a bit of greek yogurt, or exactly how it came out of the oven\u2013and teach everyone about your new friend, rhubarb.Get the recipe:Rhubarb Custard CakeThis custardy cake requires no mixer and comes together in minutes.
