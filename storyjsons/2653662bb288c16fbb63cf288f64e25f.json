Crackers? Who Cares\u2014They\u2019re DeliciousI can easily eat a thousand of them at a time.By Christina ChaeyAugust 8, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie CraigFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.After 30 years of munching my way through Choco Pies, shrimp crackers, and fistfuls of honey butter chips, I understand that Koreans know WHAT is UP when it comes to perfectly engineered snacks. They\u2019re always just the right balance of sweet, salty, and umami MSG, and lest you think they\u2019re only age-appropriate for children 12 and under, look no further than Orion Gosomi, the best-ever tea cookie that\u2019s way too classy to be called \u201cjunk food.\u201dThese thin sesame biscuits are delightfully crisp and nutty, studded with sesame seeds and with just the tiniest hint of coconut. They\u2019re finished with a sprinkle of crunchy sugar and, critically, SALT, which is why when you bite into Gosomi, every little node in your brain\u2019s pleasure center lights up like a pinball machine. The best way to eat it, if you\u2019re a weirdo (me), is by placing a biscuit on your tongue and letting it slowly dissolve, like a soda cracker.No one can quite agree on what, exactly, Gosomi is. Amazon describes it as a \u201csweet cookie cracker,\u201d while other retailers refer to it as a \u201ccookie,\u201d \u201ccracker,\u201d and \u201cbiscuit.\u201d (A mini Korean lesson: The \u201cgoso\u201d in \u201cgosomi\u201d refers to a word that doesn\u2019t have an English equivalent, but it roughly means \u201csweet and savory in a nutty way.\u201d) Me? I don\u2019t care what you call it. But I do challenge you to not eat a sleeve of these at a time, especially alongside a hot cup of nutty herbal tea like roasted dandelion or burdock root at approximately 3:04 p.m. on a Tuesday.Buy it: Orion Gosomi Sweet Cookie Cracker, $10 on AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
