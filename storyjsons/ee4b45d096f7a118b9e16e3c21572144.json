That\u2019s bad. I mean, it\u2019s good, don\u2019t get me wrong. But it\u2019s...insane.\u201dMaybe he\u2019s surprised because the shop hasn\u2019t even been open a week. Maybe he\u2019s surprised because New York has no shortage of slice shops, including newer ones that use house-milled flour, housemade mozzarella, or naturally leavened dough, just like his does. But I wasn\u2019t surprised.It feels silly to say that a slice shop feels important. Or highly anticipated. Or destined for greatness. (It\u2019s just pizza, right?) But if you enjoy a good slice in the slightest\u2014and you look at who built F&F Pizzeria\u2014it\u2019s hard not to feel that way about Brooklyn\u2019s newest, buzziest pizza joint. And to start, you have the Franks.From left: Frank Falcinelli, Chris Bianco, Chad Robertson, and Frank Castronovo.\nPhoto by Alex LauFrank Falcinelli and Frank Castronovo are the Italian-American chefs and restaurant owners behind Cobble Hill, Brooklyn\u2019s beloved Frankies Spuntino (with a location in Manhattan too) and Franks Wine Bar (formerly Prime Meats). Their spots, serving reliable, well-executed Italian classics, made with top-notch ingredients, are neighborhood favorites\u2014just look at the lines out the door any night of the week. If they\u2019d opened a pizzeria by themselves, it would have been noteworthy. But what makes F&F even more impressive is the fact that Falcinelli and Castronovo asked two legends to help them: American pizza savant Chris Bianco, whose Phoenix pizzeria has been making pies of the highest quality for close to 30 years\u2014long before \u201cresponsible grains\u201d or \u201cnaturally leavened dough\u201d were buzzwords in the industry\u2014and whose canned tomatoes are some of the best in the country.) And grain guru Chad Robertson, whose knowledge of grain varieties, dough fermentation, milling techniques, and wheat suppliers makes his bread at San Francisco\u2019s Tartine Bakery some of the most celebrated in the world. Needless to say, F&F\u2019s All Star team, isn\u2019t just turning out great pizza, it\u2019s responsible, nutritious, and considered too.A week before they sold their first slice, I got to sit down with the guys to talk pizza, bread, tomatoes, health, and life in general. Here\u2019s what gets said (and sometimes shouted) when a bunch of pizza nerds get together for espresso:Quality pizza starts with quality ingredients.\nPhoto by Alex LauThe Franks on F&F\u2026 \u201cI think what\u2019s great about this group here is that we\u2019re totally aligned in what our mission is, as far as feeding people. It\u2019s good, simple, nutritious, delicious food. Healthy food without screaming, It's a health food! When we started this project, we said, \u2018If we\u2019re going to do pizza, it\u2019s gotta be like that, or it wouldn\u2019t be us.\u2019\u201dChad on food\u2019s final frontier\u2026 \u201cI feel like grain is the last frontier of where chefs are looking at the source. It happened with produce, it happened with meat, it happened with fish. For most of our lives it\u2019s been white flour or wheat flour. But now there are dozens, no hundreds of varieties, and different extractions, and different types of milling. You can make bread that looks like white bread\u2014the texture and the volume are about the same\u2014but it's got more flavor, more nutrition, and when you eat it, your body reacts differently. Pizza can be healthy, based on what you\u2019re putting on top, but the grain itself is more of a focus now.\u201dChris on the future\u2026 \u201cI didn\u2019t invent pizza and Chad didn\u2019t invent bread. But we need to leave things better than we found them, or at least ask why or what we could\u2019ve done to push, you know? I would say we could blame the unintentional ignorance or lack of transparency of our fathers [for where we are now]. They might have used something that was in their pantry for years. Maybe it was something their mother used. But maybe we should turn the label around sometimes.\u201dBianco\u2019s tomatoes are clutch.\nPhoto by Alex LauChad on the Fourth Wave\u2026 \u201cWith Third Wave, it became acceptable to wait half an hour for someone to make your coffee. But with Fourth Wave, it\u2019s about taking the quality of Third Wave and making it convenient and accessible and affordable to everyone. I feel like that's got to be the thing with \u2018farm to table\u2019 or \u2018local\u2019 or \u2018regional\u2019 or \u2018organic\u2019 or whatever. This is a slice shop and it's going to be the best stuff: the best grain, the best long fermented process, best olive oil, tomatoes, all that, but it\u2019s not fancy pizza. It's not, you know, $30 pie.\u201dChris on dedication... \u201cI got three kids and if I had one more, I\u2019d be a fucking serial killer. But it took me a lot of years to understand that, Holy shit, I might have to share something with small people that they'll be able to use in their lives. And really all I can think of is just, Don't be an asshole. That's as much as I can do, the rest is up to them. I can give them some structure to be kind, to understand that a person, place, or thing needs more than what you want to give them. And whether it\u2019s a slice shop, a drugstore, affordable housing, mass transit\u2014fill in the blank\u2014it will always serve you best to study it.\u201dThe Franks on the power of pizza\u2026 \u201cAt the base of it, we\u2019re really trying to change the food system. To put a face to the agriculture\u2014put it within a product and serve it to people\u2014without being so preachy about it. Pizza is one of the most commonly eaten foods in the world. There's a pizzeria in every city on the planet. So why not take the most basic thing, the thing that everybody loves and do the best with it? It's a very humble Trojan horse to try to change shit with.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsBrooklynPizzaRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
