Making extra tonight means a stress-free dinner tomorrow (steak sandwiches with fennel slaw, anyone?), a little strategy we call nextovers.\u00a0Reprinted With Permission From COOK90: The 30-Day Plan for Faster, Healthier, Happier Meals By David Tamarkin, Published By Little, Brown and Company, 2018Ingredients4 servings plus leftovers 2large heads of broccoli (about 2\u00bd lb. total)6Tbsp. plus \u00be cup extra-virgin olive oil\u00bdtsp. kosher salt, divided, plus moreFreshly ground black pepper\u00bdcup finely chopped shallot or red onion\u00bccup fresh lime juice312-oz. sirloin, boneless rib-eye, or New York strip steaks (about 1\u00bc\" thick)2tsp. vegetable oil1cup finely chopped cilantro2Tbsp. rinsed capers, coarsely chopped\u00bdjalape\u00f1o, finely choppedPreparationStep 1Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 425\u00b0. Cut broccoli into large florets with some stalk attached. Divide between 2 rimmed baking sheets lined with parchment or foil. Drizzle each with 3 Tbsp. olive oil; season generously with salt and some pepper. Toss to combine. Roast, tossing and rotating baking sheets halfway through, until crisp around the edges and charred in spots, 35\u201340 minutes. Season with more salt and pepper if desired.Step 2Meanwhile, mix shallot, lime juice, and \u00bd tsp. salt in a small bowl. Set aside.Step 3Season steaks generously all over with salt and pepper, pressing to adhere. Heat a dry large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high. Swirl vegetable oil in pan to coat. Pat steaks dry; cook 2 steaks, undisturbed, until undersides are browned, about 5 minutes. Turn; cook until other sides are browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 130\u00b0 for medium-rare, about 5 minutes. Turn steaks onto fat cap and cook until browned, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes. Wipe out skillet, leaving just enough fat to coat pan. Repeat with remaining steak.Step 4Mix cilantro, capers, jalape\u00f1o, and remaining \u00be cup olive oil into reserved shallot mixture. Reserve 1 steak and \u00bc cup cilantro salsa verde for making the Steak Sandwiches another night. Thinly slice remaining steaks against the grain. Top with salsa verde and serve with broccoli.How would you rate Pan-Roasted Steak with Crispy Broccoli?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (8)Back to TopTriangleThis salsa verde was EVERYTHING. So so delicious. I cooked the broccoli for about half the time suggested (20mins) and it came out wonderfully charred - I can't imagine what it would have been like after 35-40 minutes; I would caution others to use their judgement/knowledge of their ovens when cooking the broccoli versus following the recipe as written. I served the steak and broccoli alongside some couscous with the salsa verde on top and it was *chefs kiss* LivToronto, ON1/19/2021SOO delicious! I want to put the salsa verde on top of everything now! This was my first time trying capers and I definitely recommend this if you've never tried them before. Amazing little flower buds, they are!AnonymousCharlotte NC1/18/2020am i correct that the onion mixture, capers, lime juice... is just to top the steak with??\nAnonymous10/21/2019I thought the sauce and steak were a perfect combo.  I used the sauce on chicken for the next several days, the onion mellowed a bit and it was still great.  I don\u2019t eat red meat often but when I do, I\u2019ll whip up this sauce.\n\nlizla21Chicago 3/3/2019This was delicious BUT, our broccoli was crispy and tender at 15 mins at 425 F. (We frequently roast broccoli and were surprised by the suggested time at that high temperature).  We reduced the olive oil to 1/4 cup for the salsa and it really did not need more.  riverineUrbana, IL2/12/2019My partner is a super picky eater and they LOVED this. I did too, so easy and so worth itAnonymous1/24/2019DOPEEE. Perfect easy weeknight dinner when I was craving steak. I had some red wine that I thought \"deserved a steak\" to open - this rocked. Made exactly as listed except used broccolini cause I'd been wanting it and the store was out of them for so long, and just adjusted the portion size cause i'm only one person (i have a serving of uncooked steak/ broc for tomorrow, but made full portion of salsa). This method for broccoli is so effing good - crank that oven up and they get so crispy outside and tender inside - it's amazing. Cheers! (on glass two of wine now)kmarxmarxchicago, il1/24/2019I received my Bon Appetit in the mail Thursday and made this dinner on Friday!  Perfect Friday night dinner after a long week!  Easy and delicious.  The salsa verde was the perfect addition to add a little zing.  I will make this again.
