See our past recommendations here!The magazine's paper was matte with a slight sheen, almost crumpled, and the photograph on the cover looked like it was shot at dawn, its subject emerging from a dark forest and gazing in wonder at a barrel-shaped organism that hung from a tree. The man was Paul Stamets and the object of his desire was an Agarikon mushroom.I immediately recognized Stamets as the mycologist from Fantastic Fungi\u2014a 2019 documentary that explores the rich environmental and healing properties of mushrooms\u2014and the article read like a wonderfully nerdy extension of the film. I loved it. As I flipped through the magazine, I learned about the benefits of various fungi species and how to make mushroom spores, read a recipe for reishi chili, and discovered a wealth of supplements and foraging tools.I guess now is probably the time to tell you that this \u201cmagazine\u201d is actually a free catalog (remember those?). It arrived in the mail with my latest order of Host Defense MyCommunity capsules from Stamets\u2019s company, Fungi Perfecti. I first started taking the blend of 17 mushrooms for immune defense last year while suffering a particularly nasty head cold, and all I can say is that I haven\u2019t been sick since.Washington-based Fungi Perfecti was founded in 1980 and is dedicated to cultivating gourmet and medicinal mushrooms, and selling them in the form of supplements, extracts, teas, and more. They\u2019ve been publishing the annual catalog for more than 30 years with a simple goal: Get their customers (me) hyped on the wide world of mushrooms. Sure, it's branded content\u2014but it's also a great read.\u00a0I\u2019m no mycologist, but I love to cook with shiitakes and chanterelles and I swear by my fungi supplements. Meanwhile, ads for mushroom grow kits and tinctures pop up in my Instagram feed on the regular. What I love about Fungi Perfecti\u2014besides its morel beeswax candle and smoothie-perfect powders\u2014is that it\u2019s been researching, foraging, and developing mushrooms for consumer education and healthful consumption since 1980. Stamets has believed in the power of fungi since way before you could double-tap \u2019em on your smartphone and channels as much effort into sharing his knowledge as peddling his products.To flip through Fungi Perfecti\u2019s thoughtfully produced catalog is more holistic and enjoyable than the virtual buying experiences I\u2019ve come to expect. Along with a peppering of shroom-y products, the analog approach informs me of the research that goes into their development and helps me determine which consumables are right for me\u2014whether I buy from the brand or not. I\u2019ll be keeping the catalog around until next year\u2019s release, so that I can hunt for fun fungi items when it comes time to restock my capsules. Some might call that good marketing. I call it magic.Order it: Fungi Perfecti Catalog, FreeFungi Perfecti MyCommunity Mushroom Capsules$30 at iHerbExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish Loves ItShoppingRecipes you want to make.
