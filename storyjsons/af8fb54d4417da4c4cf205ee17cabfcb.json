For an over-the-top dinner menu, serve with arugula with Italian plums, Romano bean salad, paccheri with shellfish, grilled bistecca, and brioche au rhum. We said over-the-top.Ingredients8 servings\u00bccup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more\u2153cup pine nuts4small onions, unpeeled\u00bccup drained capers\u00bccup raisins\u00bccup red wine vinegarKosher salt8whole red mullets or 4 red snappers, scales removed, cleaned1cup parsley leaves with tender stemsAleppo-style or other mild red pepper flakes and lemon wedges (for serving)PreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 350\u00b0 and prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Clean grate well with a brush; oil grate. Toast pine nuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Let cool (that\u2019s it for the oven).Step 2Grill onions, turning occasionally, until skins are blackened and onions have softened (some of the juices may ooze out), 15\u201320 minutes. Transfer to a platter and let cool 10 minutes.Step 3Split onions in half. Remove outer peel and discard. Separate onion layers into individual petals. Transfer to a medium bowl and mix in pine nuts, capers, raisins, and vinegar; season agrodolce with salt.Step 4Season fish cavity and skin with salt; drizzle with \u00bc cup oil. Grill, resisting the urge to turn, until skin is lightly charred and flesh is flaky and opaque down to the bone, about 3 minutes for mullet and 8 minutes for snapper. Place a metal spatula underneath fish, then lift and gently roll over onto the other side. Cook until flesh is flaky and opaque, 3\u20138 minutes, depending on fish. If a small knife slides easily through the thickest part of flesh, fish is done.Step 5Transfer fish to a platter and spoon agrodolce over. Top with parsley and some red pepper flakes; drizzle with oil. Serve with lemon wedges.How would you rate Grilled Red Mullet with Charred Onions and Pine Nuts?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkExplore Bon App\u00e9titFishSeafoodPine NutNutSnapperMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeHealthyishGrillingDinnerRecipes you want to make.
