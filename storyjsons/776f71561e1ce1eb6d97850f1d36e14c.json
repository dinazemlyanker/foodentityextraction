See our past recommendations here!I have three roommates and limited pantry space, so stockpiling food for quarantine wasn\u2019t quite in the cards. Instead, I\u2019ve been using the Out of Milk app to track what I buy, help me shop smarter, and experiment with new recipes.My grocery list used to live across Post-Its and phone notes, but this app thankfully keeps everything in one place. When I get home from the store, I check off the items I bought and add them to the app\u2019s pantry list, so I remember to use them. Over time, I\u2019ve noticed which items get used up and re-added to the list, which helps me buy things I will actually cook with rather than more green beans (that I stare at for two weeks then feel sad about throwing away).The next step was to catalogue my whole pantry. Last week, I went through shelf by shelf and arranged everything on the countertop. Seeing everything at eye level helped me realize what I would realistically use and what I should give away (looking at you, mini jar of strawberry jam). When I decided to keep something, I added it to the app, and moved it back into the pantry. I also optimistically reorganized my food (oats to the front!) to ward off midnight snacking.I found marshmallows and rewarded myself by making s\u2019mores, then felt motivated to get creative by cooking with what I already have. Chili-lime peanuts inspired me to make pad thai for the first time, dried apricots and marcona almonds rounded out a cheese board for my roommate\u2019s birthday, and a surprise jar of cookie butter motivated me to dust off my ice cream maker and try out a new flavor.Shopping my cabinet has helped me see that I have enough to take care of myself. I\u2019ve realized that I don\u2019t need every single ingredient to make a great meal, and that I can be comfortable owning less. Still, some days are better for cooking than others: I\u2019m heating up some frozen pizza tonight.Check it out:Out of MilkExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish Loves ItShoppingRead MoreLifestyleThis App Is the Calmest Thing in My Life Right NowBy Joanna FoxRecipes you want to make.
