A great old-fashioned recipe is all about simplicity, ingredients, and technique. Start with the sugar and bitters (orange, if you please), and use warm water and plenty of stirring to help dissolve the sugar before adding ice. Opt for large ice cubes so they won\u2019t melt quickly and dilute the drink. Though we prefer rye whiskey here thanks to its peppery, spicy bite, if you like a slightly sweeter, caramel flavor, use bourbon. Whichever spirit moves you, make sure to stir the drink for 20 seconds to fully incorporate the ingredients and chill it thoroughly.Editor\u2019s note: This recipe was originally published December 8, 2016.IngredientsMakes 11teaspoon raw or granulated sugar3dashes bitters2ounces rye whiskeyOrange wedge (for serving)Maraschino cherry (for serving; optional)PreparationStep 1Stir sugar, bitters, and 2 tsp. warm water in a rocks glass until most of the sugar is dissolved.\u00a0Step 2Add 3 ice cubes and pour rye over.

The whole point of an old fashioned is to blunt the whiskey and accentuate its flavor notes. An expressed peel is perfectly suited to do just that, I would only use a wedge if the whiskey was really low quality. Should really suggest types of rye whiskey as well, especially with Canadian rye becoming popular anyone reading this recipe would assume that would be fine as well without realizing how incredibly different Canadian rye taste to American rye crajoro5/26/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titCocktailDrinks AllRye WhiskeyWhiskeyAlcohol & Other DrinksEasy5 Ingredients or FewerDrinksRecipes you want to make.
