We\u2019ll take ours skillet-size, burnished from whole wheat flour and studded with cooked grains, because we want them flavorful and with a hardy texture.Ingredients4 servings\u00becup whole wheat flour\u00bdcup all-purpose flour2Tbsp. sugar1tsp. baking powder1tsp. baking soda1tsp. kosher salt1large egg1\u00bdcups buttermilk2cups mixed cooked whole grains (such as barley, farro, rye, spelt, kamut, and/or quinoa)Melted unsalted butter (for pan)Room-temperature butter, fresh blackberries, and pure maple syrup (for serving)PreparationStep 1Whisk whole wheat and all-purpose flours, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk egg and buttermilk in a medium bowl just to incorporate. Using a few swift strokes, whisk egg mixture into dry ingredients just to combine. Stir grains into batter (you can pulse the grains in a food processor first if you prefer them in smaller pieces).Step 2Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Lightly brush with butter. Add half of batter to skillet, spreading into an even layer as wide as the skillet. Cook pancake until bubbles have formed and broken across the entire surface and underside is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Using 2 spatulas (or sliding onto a flat plate before inverting back into skillet), flip pancake. Continue to cook until lightly browned underneath, about 1 minute. Transfer pancake to a plate. Repeat with remaining batter.Step 3Serve pancakes topped with butter, fruit, and syrup.Read More: The 29 New Essential Recipes from the Bon App\u00e9tit Test KitchenHow would you rate Whole Grain Pancakes with Blackberries?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleAmazing!
