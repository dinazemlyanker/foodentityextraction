I want crunch. I want an antidote to all that buttery, slow-cooked goodness that I swaddled myself in last week.First up, celery\u2014always available, always delivers. I\u2019m currently fixating on Chris Morocco\u2019s celery, green bean, and tofu salad with chile crisp. The addictive sauce, which you spoon over the sliced-up veg, is what pulls it all together. A mixture of ginger, garlic, cinnamon, chiles and more, it\u2019s inspired by a version that Bad Saint chef Tom Cunanan bestowed upon the BA Test Kitchen last year. It\u2019s one of those condiments that you taste once and insist on always having around\u2014for eggs, rice, salads, you name it.In this video, I\u2019m making soy-basted grilled pork chops with a riff on the Tiger Salad.\nWhen chile crisp is not an option, I\u2019ll quickly riff on Alison Roman\u2019s cucumber-and-celery Tiger Salad (watch me make it in this video). It is the perfect complement to a pan-roasted pork chop\u2014hey, I never said I was going vegetarian this month.Let\u2019s see, what else? Again and again, this past year, I\u2019ve found myself turning to Amiel Stanek\u2019s dead-simple Napa cabbage salad, spiked with lots of lime juice and a flurry of chopped cilantro and dill. It\u2019s as satisfying as it is simple.Alex LauAnd If I\u2019m feeling a bit more ambitious, I\u2019ll pull out my mandoline and trying to recreate Chef Ignacio Mattos\u2019 subtle\u2014almost beguiling\u2014shaved fennel salad. It sings of orange zest and sweet champagne vinegar, while crushed Castelvetrano olives and shaved, sharp Provolone keep kicking at you with every bite.It\u2019s the ideal salad for a rich meal ahead. Of which, I imagine, I\u2019ll have plenty between now and New Year\u2019s Eve.Get the recipes:Celery, Green Bean, and Tofu salad with Chile CrispTiger SaladPan-Roasted Brined Pork ChopHerby Napa Cabbage SaladShaved Fennel Salad with Green Olives and ProvoloneExplore Bon App\u00e9titVegetableAdam NewsletterRecipes you want to make.
