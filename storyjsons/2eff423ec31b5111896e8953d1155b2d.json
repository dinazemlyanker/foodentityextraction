I have simple needs. But I have ambitious dreams. I always intend to make postcard-worthy pies that cool on a windowsill while blue jays do my dishes, but usually that plan goes out that same window because I don\u2019t have the stamina or patience for cooling pies. I make this galette instead.Maybe you\u2019ve heard the sermon before, about how much easier it is to make galette than pie. It can be \u201crustic\u201d (misshapen and oogly)! There\u2019s no pie pan required! Forget whatever blind-baking is! Yes, all of that is true here. BUT!This recipe is better than the others, which are fine. This one, by Rachael Coyle of Coyle\u2019s Bakeshop in Seattle, has a half-cup of pecans in the dough. They get toasted and ground into meal, giving the dough this nutty flavor, deeper color, and that good fat. After you grind the nuts in a food processor, you add in the rest of the dough ingredients\u2014flour, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and cold butter\u2014and give it a whir. Add ice water, slap it into a blob, and chill for an hour while the birds do the dishes.The filling is even easier\u2014blueberries mixed with sugar, lemon juice, and cornstarch to thicken. The final galette, with bursting berries and tart lemon up against that nutty flaky dough, tastes sophisticated and restaurant-y. People are like, what, do you work at Bon App\u00e9tit? Did you go to culinary school? Did you make this yourself? (That\u2019s two truths and a lie, people.)Yes!! I did!!! I gaze in proud mama glory at my galette, whose rustic shape looks like a deformed sand sculpture stepped on by a toddler. Which is to say, beautiful.And you can take it even easier on thyself if you buy almond meal ($$) or upgrade to hazelnut meal ($$$), which accomplish the same fancy goal. For alternative fruit options, I follow the recipe\u2019s ratio for blueberries to cornstarch, 2 cups berries to 1 Tbsp. cornstarch. You gotta use lemon for that needed acidic moment (or to counteract possibly-blah blueberries), which you WILL notice. It brightens everything up like an iPhone screen in a movie theater. Something everyone loves!I don\u2019t know anything about you or your life and nut allergies, but I hope you\u2019ll make this galette this summer and feel the same joy, pride, and sugar high as it\u2019s brought me, year after year. (And it\u2019s pronounced pah-cahns, not pee-cans.
