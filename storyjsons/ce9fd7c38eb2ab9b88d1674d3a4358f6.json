This version from Heirloom Kitchen author Anna Francese Gass uses bone-in pork chops that are cooked quickly to keep them juicy, paired with a tangy-sweet cacciatore-inspired sauce. Serve with a loaf of crusty bread to sop up all the tomatoey goodness.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

It is best not to cook acidic food in a cast iron skillet that is newly seasoned. If it's an old, old one like some of mine it won't hurt to cook acidic food in it for a short period of time but I wouldn't let it sit for long after cooking. Nor would I cook a long simmered acidic sauce in cast iron. It's not that it harms the pan, but the iron can leach out, which is not bad for you but can make your sauce taste metallic.\n\nAt least that's what I was always told by my Mother and Grandmother (who's cast iron skillets I have and still use....)\n\nJust an aside here, when I was a kid and had to clean up the kitchen I put Momma's cast iron skillet in the dishwasher ('cause I was lazy) more than once and it suffered no ill effects. I AM NOT recommending that anyone do that, this was an OLD, extremely well seasoned pan. I wouldn't do that now to save my life, but she never knew and I still have that skillet.....Lisa BooneAthens, GA11/15/2021Megan, I think the relatively short cooking time won't do any harm to the cast iron pan. But I also think you should get everything out of the pan and rinse it thoroughly (and put it back on the burner to dry) while you let the pork chops rest for a minute or two before eating.Dan from CT11/14/2021I haven't tried it but was under the understanding that you shouldn't cook acidic sauces like tomato based ones in cast iron pans. Megan Auckland, NZ11/13/2021First...I NEVER cook a pork chop without Brineing it for at  least four hours. Additionally, if you want to serve tomatoes over them, simply slice a plate full of Cherry Tomatoes and fry them with the onions, capers, and garlic. I will agree about the crusty bread, but then again, that should be served with EVERY meal you eat....sorry BA, you dropped the ball on this one.Gary StroupeFort Bragg, California11/13/2021Sort of a big \"MEH\".  Nothing really melds.....it's a pork chop with a pile of tomato sauce.   WAY too much sauce for the pork indicated.   Pass.maestromooreNYC11/13/2021The highlight of this recipe is the excellent \"cacciatore\" sauce. I added more capers as I love the stuff and also some mushrooms (added along with onion). The chop, however, did not blow me away. I feel like the 5 minutes of cooking in the sauce, post-sear, rendered the chops tougher and dryer than they should be. As this last cooking is too short for the sauce to impart any flavor to the pork itself, I will try to cook the chop entirely (BBQ, cast-iron or even better sous-vide) and assembling everything on the plate. I served the pork on a bed of simple roasted root vegetables. Would try again!FelixMontreal11/10/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titPork ChopPorkMeatBraiseDinnerTomatoVegetableCast ironWeeknightEasyRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
