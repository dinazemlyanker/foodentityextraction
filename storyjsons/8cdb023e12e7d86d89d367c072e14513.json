However, it\u2019s much more than a bakery, with rows of two-tops and bar-like seating, so settle in with a toast (ricotta and jam! Avocado!) in the morning or perfectly charred and bubbled pizzas in the afternoon.THE VIBE IS: chill, with friends catching up over toasts and coffees or nearby office workers grabbing a loaf or two on their way home after work.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. You can register for bread-baking classes online (Bonus: They\u2019ll tell you how to care for your sourdough starter!).\u2014Elyse InamineRen FullerRen FullerRen FullerWE ALSO LOVESurfasThe one-stop shop for all your kitchenware and gourmet food dreamsCognoscentiSuper-seasonal coffee beans with a laser focus on flavorDestroyerLA essentials\u2014from avocado toast to grain bowls\u2014like you\u2019ve never seen (or tasted) beforeExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
