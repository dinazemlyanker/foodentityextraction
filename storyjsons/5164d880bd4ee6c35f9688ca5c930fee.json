Over its twenty years, it has developed a city-wide cult following for its thoughtful, ingredient-driven cooking while retaining the welcoming vibes of a Logan Square spot you might wander into on a Monday afternoon or Thursday night.These days, as Hammel explains, its main dinner menu offers up things like ground cherries and lamb ribs and chanterelles and gai lan and fermented squash. But the cafe menu reaches back to Lula\u2019s original incarnation, and you can order the turkey sandwich, which Lula has served since Year One, from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m.The key to the sandwich\u2019s staying power, I learned, is how considered every element is. How, like everything served at Lula, provenance matters, as does technique, and most importantly, balance. It\u2019s the kind of sandwich you bite into, and it all just makes sense. No one element dominates\u2014they all just complement each other.So, about those details. Let\u2019s let Hammel the texter explain:\u201cmultigrain sourdough bread from Publican Quality Bread (Paul Kahan\u2019s place), lightly toasted in rice bran oil on a griddle.turkey brined and roasted in house from Ferndale Farm (MN).slices of \u2018mighty vine tomatoes\u2019\u2014 a greenhouse tomato project based here in IL.super fine shaved red onion, rinsed in ice water.avocado with lime and salt.lettuces from Werp Farm in Northern MI.sprouts!hot sauce aioli (house made garlic mayo with a Vietnamese hot sauce)bacon from broadbent farmclassic mild cheddar cheese\u201dNo, not exactly how you or I might make a turkey sandwich. Which is exactly why we\u2014and so many Chicagoans\u2014line up to go to Lula Cafe, the neighborhood joint that isn\u2019t really one.Go there: Lula CafeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsChicagoSandwichRecipes you want to make.
