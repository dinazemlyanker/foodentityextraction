Letting the collard greens sit even longer in the vinaigrette, tenderized them even more! AnonymousSan Francisco,CA 6/2/2020Cooked this last night with friends and WOW - was a big success. \nCouldn't get collard greens though and substituted it with an asian leaf mix which was wonderful with everything.marieokBerlin5/23/2020This recipe was beautiful in every way. So fresh & deep in flavors without feeling overly heavy or not filling. Worked perfectly as a lunch for us and definitely kicked off a plantain obsession for my husband.AnonymousVentura, CA5/15/2020Super great salad. The sumac vinaigrette works perfectly with the tart blueberries and sweet nutty plantain chips. If you eat dairy, a swipe of greek yogurt on the bowl before plating makes it a fuller feeling meal, and adds some creamy richness to the collard base!CarolinepartyrockIndiana5/8/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladCollard GreensLeafy GreensVegetablePlantainSumacHerbs & SpicesEasyQuickSideDairy-FreeVeganVegetarianGluten-FreeHealthyishFryKwanzaaJuneteenthLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
