You\u2019re like family, and your meal is proof of that: warm, comforting, time-honored flavors and textures make you feel like it could very well be your own Nonna in the kitchen whipping up hearty, homemade entr\u00e9es. It was this motivation\u2013\u2013 to bring diners into the family and Rao\u2019s into the home\u2013\u2013that led them to start bottling their sauces back in 1992.Not only are Rao\u2019s Homemade sauces lovingly crafted in small batches and slowly simmered for maximum flavor, they also come in a range of preparations. From Arrabbiata to Tomato Basil, there\u2019s a sauce for every profile and preference. And with these three featured recipes specially developed with Bon App\u00e9tit, there\u2019s a saucy Italian dish for every kind of home cook. It\u2019s just the way Rao\u2019s intended it to be.Show us someone who doesn\u2019t love lasagna and we\u2019ll show them the door. This easy-to-make weeknight version is a crowd pleaser, blending both greens and ground beef, and mozzarella and ricotta for a rich, robust taste. It\u2019s perfect for hosting a dinner party on a whim or feeding your family on a Friday night. And since you haven\u2019t got all day to prepare, this recipe takes advantage of frozen chopped spinach, pre-made lasagna noodles, and Rao\u2019s Homemade Marinara sauce. That\u2019s what we call minimum effort for maximum flavor.Weeknight Skillet Lasagna\nMaybe it\u2019s you or maybe its your kids, but there\u2019s always someone in the family who would eat eggs in any form, any time of day. This spinach and sausage frittata is a savory solution to all-day eats, using Rao\u2019s Homemade Arrabbiata sauce, which has a spicy kick. It\u2019s made with tomatoes, garlic, and crushed red pepper, and in this recipe, is the perfect complement to the natural sweetness of Italian sausage, spinach, and basil.Spicy Spinach and Sausage Frittata Affogato\nThis toasty, saucy, cheesy veggie sandwich is a hit among vegetarians or for anyone looking to take five from main-course meats.
