Go with it. The very dark charred parts are extra tasty.Ingredients4 servings4garlic cloves, finely grated\u00bccup plain whole-milk yogurt (not Greek)\u2153cup plus 2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses4tablespoons honey, divided2tablespoons Diamond Crystal or 3\u00bd teaspoons Morton kosher salt, plus more13\u00bd\u20134-pound chicken, backbone removed, halvedExtra-virgin olive oil (for drizzling)2tablespoons unsalted butter\u00bccup pine nuts or blanched slivered almonds1\u00bdcups pomegranate juice, room temperature1lime, halvedPreparationStep 1Combine garlic, yogurt, \u2153 cup pomegranate molasses, 2 Tbsp. honey, and 2 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 3\u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt in a large resealable plastic bag. Place chicken in bag and seal, pressing out any air; turn to coat. Chill, turning occasionally, at least 12 hours and up to 2 days.Step 2Let chicken sit at room temperature 1 hour before cooking.Step 3Place a rack in top position of oven; preheat to 450\u00b0. Stir remaining 2 Tbsp. pomegranate molasses and remaining 2 Tbsp. honey in a small bowl.Step 4Drizzle enough oil to barely coat the bottom of a large heavy skillet, preferably cast iron, that can hold both chicken halves (or you can roast chicken on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet). Remove chicken from marinade, letting excess drip back into bag, and place in skillet, skin side up. Pat chicken dry with paper towels; season lightly with salt. Brush or spoon pomegranate molasses mixture evenly over skin.Step 5Roast chicken until skin is lacquered and deep mahogany over most of surface and juices run clear when thigh meat is pierced with a knife, 25\u201330 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 15 minutes.Step 6Meanwhile, melt butter in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Cook pine nuts, tossing often, until golden and mixture smells nutty (don\u2019t let the butter burn), about 3 minutes. Scrape buttery pine nuts into a small bowl and season with salt.Step 7Pour pomegranate juice into a large bowl or shallow platter and squeeze in lime. Season with a large pinch of salt and stir to dissolve. Add chicken to bowl (or divide between 2 shallow bowls) and spoon buttery pine nuts over to serve.How would you rate Pomegranate-Glazed Chicken with Buttery Pine Nuts?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (3)Back to TopTriangleThis is delicious!
