An oven thermometer will end the deception, once and for all.By Alex Delany, MacKenzie Chung Fegan, and Nico AvalleJanuary 3, 2022FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Emma FishmanFacebookTwitterEmailAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Sure, in a perfect world, the number on the dial face would match the internal temperature exactly. But the reality is that, most of the time, there\u2019s a discrepancy between the temperature on the knob and the actual oven temperature, the calibration of which can vary based on the weather, your altitude, the age of your appliance, and countless other factors. Your oven probably heats differently from your best friend\u2019s oven, which heats differently from the ovens in our test kitchen.That\u2019s not a big deal if your oven is only a couple degrees Fahrenheit off the mark, but oftentimes the discrepancies can be significant. Senior editor Sarah Jampel\u2019s home kitchen oven\u2014a liar if ever there was one\u2014is off by a whopping 75 degrees. Just try getting consistent results or proper doneness on your angel food cake if you\u2019re baking it at 250 instead of 325. An inaccurate oven can also potentially cause food safety issues. If you\u2019re cooking food\u2014particularly meat\u2014and relying only on the recipe\u2019s cook time and your oven\u2019s temperature dial, you may not be bringing that roast pork up to the correct temperature if your oven is severely out of whack.But just because your oven is, in all likelihood, deceiving you doesn\u2019t mean you have to throw up your hands and allow unpredictable cook times to be a fact of life. There\u2019s an incredibly simple step you can take to guarantee that you\u2019re baking and roasting at the right temperature, no matter the weather, no matter the day: You need to buy an oven thermometer.Which oven thermometer is most accurate?The best oven thermometer is the ThermoWorks DOT Thermometer. It measures temperatures of up to 572 degrees and comes with two components\u2014a temperature probe and a magnetic digital hub that slaps onto the front of your oven, right next to your wonky temperature dial. The probe thermometer can be inserted into big, meaty roasts like prime rib or a whole turkey to monitor their temperatures as they cook, but it can also be attached to an oven grate to track the ambient air temperature. (We recommend using an all-metal binder clip to secure the probe to a middle oven rack. If you want a more permanent or less DIY-looking solution, ThermoWorks also sells a durable stainless-steel grate clip for $4 as well as a dedicated air temperature probe for the DOT.) With the probe in place, all you have to do is plug the connector cable\u2014which is 47 inches long and can withstand high heat\u2014into the hub, and an instant and accurate temperature reading will appear on the DOT\u2019s digital display, which features large numbers and a backlight for easy readability.Photo by Emma FishmanThermoWorks DOT Thermometer$45 at ThermoWorksThe DOT makes checking the true temperature of your oven wildly simple, and since it comes with an alarm setting, it can also alert you when your oven is preheated to your desired temperature based on the thermometer\u2019s reading. As another added plus, you can easily detach it to use in your smoker, pizza oven, or backyard grill, so you can have accurate temperatures indoors AND outside.There are other digital oven thermometers on the market, but as far as brands go, ThermoWorks has definitely earned our trust. You probably recognize their Thermapen instant-read thermometer and their adorable entry-level ThermoPop, both of which are our top picks for the best digital meat thermometers. They\u2019re what we use to ensure our steaks are perfectly medium-rare and our chicken breasts will not give our friends and family food poisoning. Like their cooking thermometers, the ThermoWorks DOT is easy to use, fast, and dead accurate\u2014literally everything we could want from the best oven thermometer. It\u2019s truly a set-and-forget kitchen tool, providing vital information for all of your baking and roasting needs while staying entirely out of the way.If a digital oven thermometer seems too gadgety for you or if you\u2019re more of an air-fry guy and only use your oven once a month, an analog dial oven thermometer, like this one from Rubbermaid, which displays a temperature range of 60 to 580 degrees, is an option. The stainless-steel construction can withstand high temperatures, and opposed to the DOT, you\u2019ll never have to change a battery.\u00a0Rubbermaid Stainless Steel Oven Thermometer$10 at AmazonThat said, we recommend it with reservations. For one, every time you open your oven to check the dial, the temp in your patiently preheated oven plummets rapidly. Sure, it\u2019d be great if you could read the dial face through the glass in your oven\u2019s door, but how clean is that window in your home? And those dangly little guys have a tendency to get caught or fall off when you\u2019re adjusting the height of your racks, and after a few months of regular use you\u2019ll be forced to decide between scrubbing off the baked-on layer of grease obscuring the face or never using it again. A $9 dial is also just never going to be as accurate as a digital thermometer. An analog stainless-steel oven thermometer is better than nothing, but unless you're a home cook who rarely bakes or roasts, treat yourself to the DOT.How do I use an oven thermometer?To get a read on your oven\u2019s true temperature, simply park your probe in the center of an oven rack positioned in the middle of your oven (using either a grate clip or an all-metal binder clip), crank the heat to 400 degrees, and see what the thermometer says. When it hits a steady temperature, you can move the probe around to see if your oven has hot spots. If you\u2019re curious about how far off your oven is, turn the temperature up every 25 degrees from 250 to 500 and see what the actual temperature is when it settles. Write down how far off your oven is in either direction on a piece of masking tape and stick it somewhere visible. Then, when it\u2019s time to bake, set the temperature accordingly and check the real-time reading on the thermometer\u2019s display to make sure your oven\u2019s not too hot, not too cold, but just right.Being able to heat your oven to the temperature called for in the recipe will mean that the cook times\u2014and the results\u2014are more predictable and more reliable. If we say to roast your chicken for 45 minutes at 425 degrees, but your oven, set to 425, is actually 375, it\u2019s going to take a lot longer to cook (and it might not come out as golden brown, either). An oven thermometer will make sure you hit that mark at the intended time and that your chicken looks better than it ever has before.Your oven is one of the most versatile tools in your kitchen, and with an oven thermometer keeping it honest it can truly meet its full potential. Having attained temperature perfection, it\u2019s now your duty to spread the good word. When your friends complain that their veggies always come out charred or their cakes never seem to puff up perfectly or their cookies are taking way too long to crisp, you\u2019ll have the solution ready to go. After all, chaos may be a part of life, but it has no place on your sheet pans.This article was originally written by Alex Delany in 2017.
