The real centerpiece is a bone-in glazed ham, which can redeem any small talk you\u2019re required to make with third cousins.\u00a0Learning how to cook ham takes, well, almost no learning at all\u2014as is the case with many of the best foods, the payoff is disproportionate to the prep. As long as you seek out a high-quality ham and make a delicious sauce to coat and flavor it\u2014a brown sugar glaze is always a crowd-pleaser\u2014you\u2019ll be rewarded with a handsome piece of meat that can happily serve 12 of your closest friends. It\u2019s a hands-off process you can do entirely in your oven with minimal equipment\u2014you don\u2019t need a slow cooker or even a roasting pan. Whereas a turkey begs to be dry-brined for several days, a cooked ham, as long as you remember to thaw it from frozen, requires almost no thinking ahead. And the leftover ham you will make your way through the whole week after might be even better than the ham itself?Below, we\u2019ll cover what ham even is, what distinguishes a holiday ham from a regular ham (hint: it\u2019s not just a ham wearing its ugliest sweater), and how to cook ham to perfection.Wait, though: What is ham, anyway?The word ham refers to the hind leg of a pig, usually one that has been preserved or cured, whether by salting, drying, smoking, or some combination of the three. Before widespread refrigeration, pork was processed this way to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria and extend its shelf life; these days we still do it because, well, it tastes amazing.So what\u2019s a holiday ham then?\u00a0When we\u2019re talking about the crackly, glazed, rosy-fleshed joint of meat that anchors many a Thanksgiving, Christmas, or Easter table, we\u2019re usually referring to what\u2019s known as a city ham\u2014that\u2019s the haunch of a pig that\u2019s been cured in a saltwater brine and then typically smoked and fully cooked. (A fresh ham, on the other ham hand, has not been preserved: It is uncured, unsmoked, uncooked piece of meat that must be prepared according to a different process.)Sold! Now how do I buy a great holiday ham?\u00a0To get your hands on the best ham possible, follow these four steps:1. Order aheadWhile most local butchers and even some grocery store counters will be able to hook you up with a quality specimen, we love the security of having reliably excellent mail-order sources up our sleeve. Both Snake River Farms and D'Artagnan offer Kurobuta half hams (Kurobuta is the same as Berkshire pork, which you can think of as the Wagyu of pork). Snake River's run smaller, so they're a good bet for more intimate holiday gatherings.5.5-lb Korubuta Bone-In Ham$125 at Snake River Farms8-10 lb Berkshire Pork Bone-In Spiral Half-Ham$126 at D'ArtagnanIf you're feeding a crowd, Heritage Foods sells maple-sugar-cured half hams of up to 16 pounds from Paradise Locker Meats in Missouri.\u00a012-14 lb Maple Sugar Cured Heritage Ham$234 at Heritage FoodsPorter Road's hams come from pasture-raised pigs that are cross-bred from 3 heritage breeds (Duroc, Berkshire, and Chester White). Although we usually go for a bone-in ham (more on that below), this is a great option if you prefer boneless.4.5-6.5 lb Half Ham$84 at Porter Road2. Choose bone-inThere\u2019s nothing wrong with buying a boneless ham, but we usually get one with the bone intact. There\u2019s just something festive about a bone-in piece of meat! But aesthetics aside, a leftover bone with bits of meat clinging to it is the key to a truly transcendent pot of beans or split pea soup.3. Buy halfUnless you\u2019ve got an army to feed, you probably don\u2019t need a whole ham, which can weigh around 20 pounds\u2014one reason why most purveyors cut them in half for you in the first place. A half ham clocking in at 8\u201310 pounds is plenty for a plated entr\u00e9e for 12 with leftovers, and it will serve many more as part of a snacky holiday buffet.4. Slice it yourselfWe generally like the flexibility of getting to slice a ham ourselves. That said, a spiral-sliced ham (that is, a bone-in ham that the butcher has sliced into, you guessed it, a giant spiral), falls apart into tidy pieces and is a safer option if the idea of carving a hulking piece of meat\u2014or allowing your tipsy guests to try their hands at it\u2014makes you uncomfortable.This stunner is glazed with a reduction of pineapple juice, vinegar, and brown sugar.\nI\u2019ve got the ham, but how do I cook the ham?The beauty of cooking a ham is that, well, it\u2019s already cooked\u2014all you really need to do is heat it up without drying it out, hit it with a tangy glaze right at the end, and serve it in style. Essentially, you\u2019re following a two-part cooking process: Warm the ham, covered, on low or medium heat, then increase to high heat to crisp the surface with a shellacking of sweet, spiced glaze. Here\u2019s how to cook the ham in five steps:1. PrepIf your ham is frozen, make sure to budget 2\u20133 days for it to slowly thaw in the fridge. Before cooking, let ham sit out at room temperature for at least an hour to take some chill off. And, if you opted for an unsliced ham, as we recommend, use a sharp knife to score the fat side of the ham in a crosshatch\u00a0about \u00bd\" deep. This diamond pattern will maximize crispy bits and create lots of nooks and crannies for the glaze later on.2. BakePreheat oven to 300\u00b0. Wrap the ham tightly in foil (this prevents it from drying out) and place it on a wire rack set inside a sheet pan or roasting pan. The wire rack helps to stabilize the ham and encourage air circulation. You can also bake the ham unwrapped on a wire rack in a roasting pan, but be sure to add a couple cups of water, which prevents the ham drippings from burning and generates the steam to keep the meat moist. Bake until an instant-read meat thermometer\u00a0registers at least 125\u00b0 for the internal temperature of the thickest part of the ham (avoid hitting the bone). This will take about 15\u201320 minutes per pound. (Remember: A bone-in ham will take longer to warm through than a boneless one.) If your ham is 10 pounds, then you want to account for about 3\u20133\u00bd hours of total time for it to be warmed through.3. GlazeOnce the ham is warmed through, take it out of the oven and increase the heat to 425\u00b0. Meanwhile, make this easy glaze: Whisk together 1\u00bd cups whiskey, \u00be cup honey, \u00bc cup mild-flavored (light) molasses, 1 tsp. chile flakes, and a few cranks of black pepper. Mess with the glaze recipe all you like\u2014as long as you have something boozy, something sweet (that could be honey, maple syrup, brown sugar, cranberry sauce, or even reduced orange juice or pineapple juice), and something spicy (that might be Dijon mustard, horseradish, Calabrian chiles), your ham glaze\u00a0will be a well-balanced counterpart to the rich meat.\u00a0Remove foil from ham, brush with glaze, and bake, basting with more glaze every 5 minutes or so, until deeply browned, 15\u201320 minutes total.4. RestLike any cut of meat, a baked ham needs to rest before serving to be its best, juiciest self. Give it at least 20 minutes or resting time.5. ServeIf ham is the main dish\u00a0at\u00a0a sit-down dinner, you want sides that balance out its rich sweet-saltiness\u2014think simply dressed greens, scalloped potatoes, or roasted brussels sprouts. But if it\u2019s part of a holiday party spread, meant to be supplemented with many other\u00a0side dishes, the path forward is well-trodden and clear: Set out some Martin\u2019s potato rolls, tangy pickles, mayo, and good Dijon mustard and watch that ham disappear.Wait, what about all those other types of ham?\u00a0Just because a brined city ham will always be our holiday ride-or-die doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t equally enamored of the many and storied styles out there. We\u2019re particularly fond of these drier air-cured varieties that want to be sliced thinly and served as charcuterie.\u00a0Country Ham: America\u2019s esteemed entry into the pantheon of dried pork, country ham is a Southern tradition. Salted, typically heavily smoked, and air-dried, it is eaten both cooked and, sometimes, sliced thin as charcuterie\u2014our favorite way to experience its smoky, funky flavor.Prosciutto di Parma: While prosciutto can come from many parts of Italy, the stuff from Parma is arguably the finest. Salted and air-dried for many months, and sometimes years, it\u2019s delicate, supple, and sweet.Speck: Denser and brawnier than prosciutto, this style of Italian ham gets big flavor from the addition of aromatics like juniper, bay, and pepper to the cure, along with a light smoking.Jam\u00f3n Serrano: Originally hailing from the mountains of Spain, and usually made from specific breeds of pigs, Serrano is mildly salty, nutty, and complex, with a distinctly porky finish.Party meat:1 / 30ChevronChevronLow-and-Slow Rib RoastView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingShoppingRecipes you want to make.
