Nothing beats the convenience of a bag of spinach, but any green will work here. Try mustard greens, kale, or collard greens.Ingredients4 servings 2Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil1lb. sweet or hot Italian sausage, casings removed5garlic cloves, 3 thinly sliced, 2 finely grated\u00bdtsp. dried oregano\u00bctsp. crushed red pepper flakes (optional)128-oz. can crushed tomatoes3tsp. kosher salt, divided, plus more15-oz. package baby spinach, coarsely chopped215.5-oz. cans white beans, rinsed4Tbsp. unsalted butter112\" crusty Italian sub roll, cut in half crosswise, split lengthwise, or 2 ciabatta rolls, split lengthwise1oz. Parmesan or Pecorino, finely gratedChopped parsley (for serving; optional)PreparationStep 1Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or high-sided skillet over medium-high. Add sausage and press down on it with a heatproof rubber spatula to flatten slightly. Cook, undisturbed, until browned underneath, about 4 minutes. Turn sausage over and cook, undisturbed, until browned on the other side, about 3 minutes. Break up sausage into bite-size pieces with spatula. Add sliced garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes (if using) and cook, stirring, until garlic is beginning to get golden around the edges, about 1 minute. Carefully add tomatoes (beware of splatter!), then 2\u00bd tsp. salt and 1 cup water. Bring sauce to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly reduced, 10\u201312 minutes. Mix in spinach and cook until wilted, about 2 minutes. Add beans and cook until warmed through, about 3 minutes. Taste rag\u00f9 and season with more salt if needed.Step 2Meanwhile, heat broiler. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Mix in grated garlic and remaining \u00bd tsp. salt and cook until fragrant and sizzling but garlic is not yet browned, about 30 seconds; remove from heat.Step 3Arrange bread, cut side down, on a foil-lined baking sheet and broil until golden brown, about 1 minute. Remove from broiler and turn bread over. Brush untoasted sides of bread with garlic butter and broil until evenly golden brown on top, about 1 minute (keep watch; it will go fast).Step 4Divide toast among plates. Ladle a generous amount of rag\u00f9 over and top with Parmesan and parsley.Step 5Do Ahead: Rag\u00f9 can be made 3 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill. Reheat over medium-low.How would you rate Weeknight Beans on Toast?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (18)Back to TopTriangleVery nice with curly kale added just before serving so it stays semi-crisp. This is SO reminiscent of my step-Dad's sausage stew! He used roma tomatoes (canned, whole) smashed up, pinto beans, and a can of black olives. In college with no kitchen I used to make this in an electric wok. Thanks for the memories!troutappleTucson5/25/2021We made this on Friday and it was soooo easy and also delicious. We're absolutely going to make it again. We added a full 8 ounce bag of spinach and it was really great. I think next time I'd add a bit more garlic and red pepper flakes. Mandy CaceresArlington, VA5/4/2020This was delicious! I don\u2019t eat meat, so I used vegetarian sausage and it still turned out great. Did think it required a lot of salt, but added cautiously due to the reviews. It all came together very quickly for a great weeknight meal. Paige SteinerWashington, DC3/9/2020Thank you once again, Bon App\u00e9tit, for another perfect, delicious and phenomenal recipe!! Didn\u2019t change anything except the sausage. I don\u2019t care for Italian sausage so I subbed a pound of spicy breakfast sausage. Amazing and a total keeper. Well done!!Pam DimondWarrenville Illinois 1/27/2020Another winner-BA has done it again! We loved this dish. I used 85% lean ground beef seasoned it with 1/2 tsp dry Italian seasoning, 1 tsp salt, 2 cloves of minced garlic, 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper & some dried oregano. Didn\u2019t add the water as I wanted a thick consistency & used multi colored kale instead of spinach. I also added few dashes of sugar and a couple of garlic cloves while the pot simmered. Season with salt as you cook. I grated Parmesan cheese on cooked pasta and after pouring the bean stew on the pasta, I grated pecorino cheese on top and drizzled with some high quality olive oil.  Thank you Again BA for another amazing recipe!AnonymousManhattan, New York City 1/22/2020Very good, and super easy to make! Not a lot of ingredients, but I can see this being easy to change up. I didn't add any salt, because the sausage I had was already pretty salty (I did add a dash or two of Accent ;) ).  I also put it on top of toasted, buttered English Muffins; I'm sure it would be great with almost anything, including pita or a tortilla on the side. Aside from that, I followed the recipe exactly, and there are plenty of leftovers! I will be making this again!Vermont9/11/2019I took the advice of other reviewers and decreased the amount of salt to one teaspoon. Even that seemed like a little too much! Even so, the ragu was delicious. I simply buttered the bread before broiling, though I'm sure garlic butter would have been great. I would suggest starting with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and adding more as you taste throughout. A great weeknight meal that my family loved.cew003Arkansas5/25/2019So dang good and not too salty! Love that the recipe makes extra sauce. AnonymousTexas4/25/2019DELICIOUS. So, so good and so, so quick and easy. My butter accidentally browned when I wasn't looking (oops), but I am not mad about it. So great for leftovers at lunch, too!AnonymousChicago, IL3/12/2019Loved this dish!  I followed it exactly using 1/2 teaspoon Morton Kosher Salt - plenty salty.   I portioned out leftovers for my lunch.  Thank you for this super great idea!dcarsCleveland, OH2/20/2019Really tasty dish that I will definitely make again!  I don't eat dark leafy greens, so I simply omitted the spinach.  After reading other reviews, I cut the salt way back to 1/2 teaspoon, and it was plenty.  I'm watching carbs, so I served as a soup with some whole grain crackers.  AnonymousOxford, MS2/15/2019Great recipe -- I used mixed super greens (spinach/chard/kale) and it was very tasty. It came together in about 20 minutes and was delicious and filling.AnonymousBerkeley, CA2/10/2019Delicious! I made a vegetarian version using Beyond Meat sausage that worked perfectly. Also used kale instead of spinach. Served with a salad and homemade Italian dressing. I used a fraction of the salt as others have cautioned and it turned out perfectly. This one's going into rotation in our household for sure! AnonymousLos Angeles 2/8/2019Fantastic recipe!!!! Comes together easily and fast, and tastes amazing!!! I didn\u2019t have Italian sausage so I used ground turkey meat...I regularly make recipes from Deb Perelman\u2019s blog (Smittenkitchen.com) and they never disappoint!!!AnonymousOhio2/6/2019So easy and delicious. Used kale because it\u2019s what we had in the fridge. Another fav Bon Appetit recipe is the sausage, white beans and kale topped with a poached egg. This is a great recipe to cook with leftover ingredients from that for a household of 2. Re salt comments - when using sea salt and Morton salt it is saltier but of using Diamond Crystal or another less salty salt, amount in recipe was fine. xo thanks Deb!AnonymousMaryland2/6/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titSauceToastWhite BeanBeanVegetableSausageMeatCanned TomatoTomatoSpinachLeafy GreensEasyWeeknight MealsMainNut-FreeSimmerDinnerRecipes you want to make.
