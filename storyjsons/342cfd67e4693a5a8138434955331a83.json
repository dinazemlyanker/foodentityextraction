Sweet? Spanish? Which type of onion is the right one to use for what? Allow us to explain.By Alex Delany and Sarah JampelMay 17, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Emma Fishman, Food Styling by D'mytrek BrownFacebookTwitterEmailOnions are members of the allium family, a genus of pungent plants that also includes garlic, leeks, chives, ramps, and hundreds of other species. Even among onions there are many, many different types, each with its own special qualities\u2014a distinct onion personality, if you will.\u00a0But since we can\u2019t possibly cover all alliums (all-iums?) in one article, we\u2019ve divided just a fraction of those we reach for frequently into the three unofficial categories:Storage OnionsSoftiesLittle GuysSo what do we like about the different types of onions? And in what situation do we prefer one over the others? These are the great questions of our time...or at least of your most recent Google search. Here's what you need to know about the different types of onions:(1) Storage OnionsBecause they\u2019re cured (i.e., laid out to dry) after they\u2019re harvested, usually in late summer, they\u2019ll keep in your kitchen for months if stored properly. At the grocery store they\u2019re likely labeled by color (white, yellow, and red), but at a farmers market, you may see proper names, like Australian Browns or Red Zeppelins. In terms of pungency, white are generally the mildest, red the sharpest, and yellow somewhere in between. And while we prefer yellow for cooking, white for garnishing, and red for pickling, grilling, and everything in between, they\u2019re generally interchangeable: Switching between them won\u2019t ruin a dish, even if it slightly alters its flavor or appearance.Yellow Onions\"Old yeller.\"\nIf a recipe doesn\u2019t specify, chances are it\u2019s calling for one of these old faithfuls (also called brown onions). In fact, nearly 90 percent of all storage onions grown in the U.S. are yellow. They\u2019re severe when raw but mellow when saut\u00e9ed, roasted, or caramelized. Because they have a relatively high starch content, they won\u2019t dissolve to mush even after long cook-times, which makes them a great all-purpose cooking onion. Spanish onions, BTW, are a larger, milder relative that can be yellow or white\u2014don\u2019t stress about finding one when a recipe says so.Red OnionsSharper and spicier than yellow onions, you\u2019ll often see them raw, whether in salads, like Greek salad or kachumber, or alongside long-cooking braises. Soak them in ice water as you prep your other ingredients to make them extra crisp and rid them of some fierceness. The obvious draw to a red onion is its color, with a deep red hue that provides a nice contrast. In some cases, though, they may discolor and turn light ingredients, like eggs, potatoes, and beans, a blueish-gray.\u00a0Hello, red onion.\nWhen it comes to grilling, red onions are our first choice. Cut into wedges, they char nicely on the grill, and their interior texture goes jammy, instead of mushy, like white and yellow onions tend to do. They're also our first choice for pickling, which we love to do when tacos, pizza, or fried rice are involved.White OnionsSofter and milder than yellows and reds, these have thin, papery skins and, while still sharp, less of a lingering aftertaste. We prefer them cooked quickly or served raw, like in pico de gallo or atop huevos rancheros (they\u2019re particularly popular in Latin and Central American cuisine), or whenever you need one in the dish and as a garnish (think chili).A white onion sheds its skin.\nYou can further tame their flame by slicing one thinly and giving it an hour-long soak in cold water\u2014they'll be so sweet, you can practically eat them like a salad. (Okay, maybe that's a little dramatic, but the flavor will mellow dramatically, and you can probably eat a lot more of them.)(2) SoftiesMore delicate than storage onions, these should all be stowed in the refrigerator to extend their lifespan.Sweet Onions\u00a0Hi sweetie.\nBecause they contain less sulfur and more water than yellows, reds, and whites, they\u2019re mild, crisp, and good for eating raw, frying into onion rings, and stuffing like you would a mushroom or tomato. Defined by the particular region where they\u2019re grown\u2014Washington\u2019s Walla Wallas, Georgia\u2019s Vidalias, and Hawaii\u2019s Mauis, for example\u2014they\u2019re often only available seasonally.Green OnionsAlso called scallions (on BA, we call these scallions exclusively!), bunching onions, and, confusingly, spring onions (wrong!), they\u2019re milder, softer, and more herbaceous than any of the storage bulbs. They\u2019re as good raw, like scattered over braised tofu or fried eggs, as they are slowly cooked, like infused into oil for Cantonese-style scallion sauce.Spring OnionsJuicy, sweet newbies! These are just storage onions that are harvested prematurely to give the other bulbs room to grow. As the name implies, they\u2019re super seasonal. When you get your hands on them, make them the star: Grill, roast, or braise them whole or halved, tops and all, then cover with lemony breadcrumbs, punchy mustard dressing, or\u2014as an homage to Catalonian cal\u00e7ots (a scallion-esque onion relative)\u2014romesco.When you've got spring onions, flaunt 'em.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kat Boytsova(3) Little GuysGood things come in small packages! Pro tip: If you need to peel a whole bunch at once (ugh), try blanching them first.ShallotsUse these wherever you\u2019d use a storage onion. They have an onion-y flavor without being too aggressive and are beloved for their versatility. They\u2019re at home finely chopped and stirred into a lemon vinaigrette, halved and roasted alongside a chicken, pickled whole, as in the Vietnamese dish dua hanh, or fried in thin slices for a crunchy topper for laksa, korma, and gado gado. FWIW, we consider one bulb to equal one shallot, even if it contains two lobes.Cipolline (a.k.a. Cipollini) OnionsOnion or UFO?\nPhoto by Emma FishmanThese Italian cuties are naturally, rather than forcibly, petite and squat like saucers. They\u2019re more sugary than big onions, which makes them ideal for roasting whole until caramelized. For an easier time peeling their thin skins, try boiling them for about 30 seconds first.Pearl OnionsA co-star of coq au vin and boeuf bourguignon, they\u2019re sweet and small (they\u2019re grown in close quarters and harvested early) and come in red, white, and yellow. Halved or left whole, they can be roasted, braised, pickled, creamed, glazed, confited, or used to crown a stunning tarte tatin. Look for pre-peeled bags in the freezer aisle.Pickled pink pearl onions are almost too beautiful.\nPhoto by Alex LauGo all in on alliums:Bean Confit With Lemon, Saffron, and All the AlliumsBeans cozy up with spring alliums and plenty of olive oil.View RecipeEditor\u2019s note: This article was originally published June 28, 2018.Explore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyRed OnionOnionRecipes you want to make.
