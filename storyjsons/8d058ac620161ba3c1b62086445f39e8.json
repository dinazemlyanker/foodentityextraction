The pharmacist Suekichi Yoshimaru came up with the idea of grinding fish bones into powder as a way of addressing rampant mineral, fiber, and protein deficiencies at a time when many peoples\u2019 diets consisted primarily of white rice. Yoshimaru\u2019s mixture of pulverized sardines, poppy seeds, and seaweed was sold in small flasks and marketed as Gohan no Tomo, or \u201cFriend of Rice,\u201d and became a bestseller.What is furikake?These days furikake is, broadly speaking, a mixture of sesame seeds, seaweeds, herbs, fish flakes, and salt that derives its name from the Japanese term for sprinkles. It's commonly served on bowls of steamed rice and pressed into rice-based snacks like onigiri for another layer of flavor, texture, and nourishment.How is furikake traditionally made at home?While furikakes are widely available at Japanese grocery stores and come in a dizzying number of variations, they\u2019re so simple to make at home that it never dawned on my mother nor my grandmother to buy them from a store.\u00a0They made us the classic furikakes\u2014gomashio (toasted sesame seeds and sea salt) and shiso (ground sun-dried pickled red shiso leaves)\u2014using a traditional suribachi and surikogi (mortar and pestle). They also made furikake with the spent katsuobushi (bonito flakes) and kombu that they had used to make dashi (broth). The repurposed ingredients were chopped into small pieces and simmered in soy sauce, mirin, and sake until they became flaky and dry enough to sprinkle on rice. Other times they never turned sprinkle-able and we enjoyed them as tsukudani, moist sweet-savory pickles often eaten with plain rice or used as an onigiri filling.What types of furikake are available?Furikake has come a long way since I was a child growing up in Japan in the \u201860s. With the advent of freeze-drying and other preservation methods, the furikake industry has exploded, turning these instant flavor enhancers into a popular convenience available at any Japanese grocery store. No wonder Japanese cooks don\u2019t bother bringing out their mortar and pestle anymore. (I still do, but I\u2019m one of the few who still preaches doing the dirty work.)Modern furikakes come in a variety of combinations. While the classic gomashio, shiso, and katsuobushi still stand, you\u2019ll also find furikakes with newer additions like dehydrated egg, wasabi, nori, sardines, cod roe, umeboshi, meat, yuzu, curry powder, and other spices. And thanks to industrial dehydrators, they\u2019re also drier, crispier, and longer-lasting than those homemade versions I grew up with.How can I use furikake?Furikake is versatile and doesn\u2019t need to be saved for special meals or even reserved for Japanese dishes\u2014it can become a daily seasoning like salt or pepper if you wish. I\u2019ve found blends that not only give my rice a punch of flavor but also jazz up my pasta, noodles, vegetables, pizza, popcorn, dips, and\u2014in my latest experiment\u2014focaccia.\u00a0Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and furikake is an untraditional but delicious combination.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Susie Theodorou, Prop Styling by Aneta Florczyk\u00a0To use it well, avoid over sprinkling\u2014like salt, it's salty!\u2014and pair it with foods that are fairly mellow in flavor: Scatter it on scrambled eggs, steamed or roasted fish, or fried rice; use it to add texture and oomph to a split steamed sweet potato, chicken salad, crudit\u00e9s; distribute it over crackers and cookies as a finishing touch right before baking. Or follow the lead of Kristina Cho and make furikake, along with scallions, mayonnaise, and pork floss, the filling for savory swirl buns.Yes, adding furikake to a Western dish can blur its authenticity, but if it tastes good, why not?Where can I buy furikake (and how can I find the good stuff)?On the West Coast, where I live, I\u2019ve found delicious furikakes made from locally harvested seaweeds and salts. The best seaweed-based furikakes are fresh, sustainably sourced, and free of chemical additives. The U.S.\u2013made furikakes and furikake-adjacent spice blends I like are from Daybreak Seaweed Company, Jacobsen Salt Co., and Eden Foods.Jacobsen Furikake Seasoning$10 at My Panier$11 at Weston TableEden Foods Seaweed Gomasio$3 at Thrive Market$10 at AmazonDaybreak Golden State Seasoning Salt$12 at Daybreak Seaweed CoIf you buy furikake from a Japanese market, there are as many options as there are instant ramen. I recommend you seek out those with no artificial additives (like chemical preservatives or food coloring). The labels are often not translated into English, but you can always ask the shopkeeper to help you. At the moment Noritama furikake\u2014a mix of nori seaweed, dehydrated egg, and sesame seeds seasoned with soy, sugar, and loads of artificial preservatives\u2014is popular among both Japanese children and adults. I tend to stick to the classics like gomashio and shiso, preferably without additives.The definition of furikake seems to be evolving\u2014I\u2019ve even come across savory granolas that act like furikake but are substantial enough to be snacks. As is always the case, food cultures are crisscrossing and coexisting on individual plates, striving for perfect balance and harmony. And while I never would have thought that the tiny savory sprinkles of my childhood would become the darling of the global seasoning world, I can vouch for their goodness.Sprinkle away:Pork Floss and Seaweed Pull-Apart RollsThese pillowy milk bread buns are filled with an irresistible combo of sweet-and-salty pork floss, mayonnaise, and savory furikake.View RecipeSonoko Sakai is a Japanese American cooking teacher and the author of Japanese Home Cooking.Recipes you want to make.
