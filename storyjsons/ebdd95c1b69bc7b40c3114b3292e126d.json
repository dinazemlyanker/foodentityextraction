I didn\u2019t know they would revolutionize the way I cook.By Mehreen KarimJune 21, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Emma FishmanFacebookTwitterEmailAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

While I knew that it would take long-term systemic environmental progress to safeguard the future of our planet, I also knew the least I could do was curb my dependence on wasteful plastic products. But I dragged my feet. Surely, I thought, making the switch to reusable storage containers wouldn\u2019t be easy or efficient, and it certainly wouldn\u2019t be cute. But then I discovered Stasher bags, the reusable, dishwasher-, microwave-, freezer-, and oven-safe silicone pouches that also come in the pastel bubblegum-pink of my Y2K dreams.Photo by Emma FishmanStasher Bags$55 at Amazon (set of 4 small)$22 $15 at Amazon (half-gallon)When I first got my hands on Stasher bags, which I ordered in a variety of colors and sizes, I looked forward to the order they would bring to my fridge\u2014no more stained containers and haphazardly plastic-wrapped bowls cluttering the shelves. It wasn\u2019t long before I had filled my lime-green gallon-size mega bag with dozens of cookie dough balls and a cantaloupe-hued sandwich Stasher with crackers from a half-eaten charcuterie board. Snack- and pocket-size Stasher bags meant I was no longer wasting half-cans of tomato paste or the last chipotle in adobo. And it took me no time at all to realize there\u2019s no better way to store raw meat than inside a lavender midsize Stasher. The leakproof seal means there\u2019s no risk of chicken juice seeping out into your fridge.Another word about that seal\u2014Stasher bags close so tightly (shout-out to Pinch-Loc\u2122 seal technology) that you can even sous vide in them. Place your ingredient of choice\u2014whether it\u2019s a cut of steak or some vinegared onions ready for quick-pickling\u2014in a Stasher bag, submerge in hot water, and let the sous vide magic happen. This guide on how to steam veggies in Stashers allayed any concerns I had about boiling my pretty little silicone pouches, and now I\u2019m fitting more produce into my meals without laboring in front of a stove. Not in the mood to boil even water? Microwave a stand-up mini bag filled with last night\u2019s chicken tagine and basmati, leaving it half-open for optimal ventilation and half-closed to contain splatters and keep that meat moist. This one\u2019s for you, Team No Microwave: You can use the same method to reheat your Stasher leftovers in the oven too. And when you\u2019re done using your them for cooking or food storage, just throw them in the top rack of the dishwasherNow I\u2019m expanding my collection and inching closer to banishing single-use plastic from my kitchen. I knew that making the switch to Stasher bags would be easier on the environment. I didn\u2019t anticipate they\u2019d make my life so much easier too.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
