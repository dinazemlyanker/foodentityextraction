It's kind of like BLT soup. I added more stock/water (about 4 cups total) and a can of white beans to make it a meal on its own. So tasty! CJSan Diego, CA11/8/2021This is a solid recipe, start to finish: easy, hearty, rewarding.  Dom's review hits the nail on the head as you may want to play with the proportions a bit on your second run, the broth is amazing.  This one's going into the repertoire on the regular.TylerNew York, New York2/22/2021Loved the end product! But I would make a few tweaks: for fattier bacon the oil isn't really needed and I ended up with so much fat I couldn't really char the tomatoes. Also, I prefered adding a fair bit more salt to counter the sweetness of the honey. Next time I'll use half the amount of honey because otherwise it was too sweet. RhiFrance 2/16/2021Why doesn\u2019t this have more reviews?? It\u2019s so good! And simple to make. Previous reviewer you could really add as much or little greens as you want but I always put a lot more than I think I will use when I make this cause it wilts down to such a small amount. But man I could drink that broth by itself so I add a lil more bacon, vinegar, and water. Love this dish!DomLos Angeles, California1/20/2021I love this recipe, but \"10 cups torn greens\" couldn't be a more vague amount. Is this two bunches? A pound? Who's to say. I think I usually use two bunches (~2lbs).
