We follow the three tenets of traditional Southern cornbread: There's no sugar added, there's no flour (only course-ground cornmeal), and there's no better way to bake it than in a cast-iron skillet. This rustic cornbread is sturdy and dry and meant to be dunked, like say in this beef chili. Serve it with this hot honey butter.This recipe is presented to you by Samsung.Ingredients12 servings 2\u00bdcups coarse-grind cornmeal1\u00bcteaspoons baking soda1\u00bcteaspoons kosher salt1large egg1\u2154cups buttermilk2tablespoons bacon fat, lard, or unsalted butterHot Honey Butter (for serving)Special EquipmentA 10-inch-diameter cast-iron skilletPreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 375\u00b0. Set dry skillet over low heat to heat while you make the batter. Whisk cornmeal, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Make a well in the center and add egg and buttermilk, then whisk vigorously, starting in the center to incorporate egg and working your way out, until dry ingredients are incorporated and batter is smooth.Step 2Increase heat to medium-high and add bacon fat to skillet. Swirl to coat bottom and sides of skillet. Whisk batter once more to reincorporate, then pour into skillet and smooth top (batter will sputter around edges).Step 3Bake cornbread in oven until the edges are golden brown and the top is golden, cracked in places, and firm to the touch, 25\u201330 minutes. Let cool in pan at least 5 minutes before cutting into wedges. Serve with Hot Honey Butter.Step 4Do Ahead: Cornbread can be baked 8 hours ahead. Let cool; store tightly wrapped at room temperature.How would you rate Classic Skillet Cornbread?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (3)Back to TopTriangleComes together super quick and easy! Very dry but pairs great with chili.KatiehwalshAustin4/10/2020Delicious! Pairs well with chili or good as a snack. Soaks up sauce nicely. Love that it\u2019s not sugary or uses wheat flour.
