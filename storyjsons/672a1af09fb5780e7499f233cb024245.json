Probably not.By Sarah JampelFebruary 15, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Sarah JampelFacebookTwitterEmailEvery time I finish an episode of the Great British Baking Show and head into the kitchen, I feel like a kid cartwheeling in the living room after watching Olympic gymnastics. There\u2019s something about seeing those athletes\u2014I mean, bakers\u2014schvitzing in the hellishly hot conditions of the tent that I find not only entertaining but also fomenting. It lights a fire under my butt and launches me straight toward the stand mixer with hopes that, with enough creaming and folding (and maybe some lessons in British pronunciations), I too could be in that tent, attempting the impossible: an ice cream bombe made from scratch in 90 minutes and 99\u00b0 weather, a \u201cselfie\u201d constructed from cake, a chandelier of sugar cookies, a handshake with Paul Hollywood without crumbling to the floor.And since this wasn\u2019t actually the Olympics, my aspirations weren\u2019t all that irrational. These tasks were something I\u2014an avid home baker, just like all of the show\u2019s actual contestants\u2014could really, possibly, maybe, theoretically do. Hadn\u2019t my years of baking brownies on the weekend (and\u2014okay, okay, I\u2019ll admit it\u2014a few stints in professional kitchens) prepared me for this very moment? So, to see just what sort of baking chops I really had, I embarked on a journey to make just one recipe straight from one of the show\u2019s technical challenges. How would I fare at the judges\u2019 table?The recipeThe constraints of a true technical challenge include a bare-bones recipe, a stunningly short period of time, and bakers groaning all around you (also: equipment spontaneously combusting and proofing drawers that seem intent to sabotage any dough that\u2019s put inside). Since no one wanted to play GBBS with me, I would be on my own. And since I\u2019m no masochist, I decided to give myself plenty of time and to choose a recipe from early on in the contest. It didn\u2019t need to be anything totally wacky\u2014no raspberry blancmange or two-tier lavender and lemon curd fox cake for me. Just something most of the bakers had made with moderate success.So, I landed on Le G\u00e2teau Vert, a lemony pistachio cake colored green with spinach (!), and the technical challenge from 2018\u2019s cake week (episode 2). First of all, it was supposedly Claude Monet\u2019s favorite cake, which he ate every year on his birthday. I love Monet! Who doesn\u2019t? Second, did I mention its Kermit-green hue comes from spinach? Monet, you crazy artist, you. Third, it\u2019s decorated with edible flowers. So twee. Fourth, could it even taste good (have I mentioned the spinach)? I had to know. And fifth, it\u2019s made up of several components\u2014marzipan, g\u00e9noise sponge cake (pronounced gen-o-ease in British speak), buttercream, fondant\u2014that would each present ample opportunity to flounder flourish. (If you\u2019ve watched the episode...poor Karen!) Finally, it was short and simple, but less in the reassuring, \u201cthis\u2019ll be easy\u201d way, and more in the \u201choly cow, how do I make a sponge cake without any details about what the batter should look like\u201d way.The set upSince I was only a contestant on the GBBS of my imagination, I had to source everything myself: multiple types of sugar (icing, caster, and \u201cfondant icing sugar,\u201d which does not seem to exist in the U.S.); 500 grams of pistachios (which, as it turns out, is a lot of money); kirsch (cherry brandy); and the impossible-to-track-down pistachio essence.Now\u2019s a good time to confess that I took some liberties here: Why buy pistachios when I could buy pistachio flour and skip the shelling and grinding? Why buy caster sugar when I could grind regular ol\u2019 sugar in a food processor? And why order \u201cfondant icing sugar\u201d from the U.K. when I could just...find a poured fondant recipe consisting of white chocolate, corn syrup, and confectioners\u2019 sugar? I wasn\u2019t going to walk into a burning building blindfolded, okay?The moment(s) of truthI spread out my process over two days. (Call me an imposter\u2014I\u2019d say I\u2019m a realist.) On day one, I made the marzipan and the g\u00e9noise, both of which I chilled overnight. On day 2, I made the spinach buttercream and the fondant, which set me up to assemble the cake.I started with the pistachio marzipan\u2014baby steps!\u2014which was easy to make. Mix ground pistachios with confectioners\u2019 sugar, an egg white, and \u201cpistachio essence\u201d (equal parts vanilla and almond extract, in my version), then knead it together into a Play Doh-esque mass. The only problem was that one egg white did not even moisten the dry mixture. I added another, grateful that neither Prue nor Paul was looking over my shoulder, and trudged on.Next came the \u201csponge\u201d (a.k.a. the cake), which was doomed from the get-go. For a notoriously difficult cake (leavened with only eggs, rather than a mixture of baking powder and baking soda, g\u00e9noise are known to fall flat), the instructions were vague. So...I started to read other recipes. But just for some reassurance! How \u201cthick and pale\u201d should the eggs really be? I wondered. Could I pour hot butter into that sensitive mixture without tempering it first? All of this outside research felt a little bit like taking an open-book exam\u2014i.e. condoned cheating. The down side? It totally shook my confidence: What would I have done in the tent, with no access to well-written sponge recipes?But once I saw that the cake didn\u2019t rise high in the oven\u2014it was a fairly squat thing, only an inch or so tall\u2014I knew I should\u2019ve separated the eggs, whisked the yolks until they held ribbons, and folded in well-whipped whites. Basically, I should\u2019ve followed a different recipe altogether. Instead, I wrapped up my small friend, stuck it in the fridge, and tried to forget about the fact that I\u2019d have to cut it in three horizontal slices the next day.The following morning, I set out to make the French buttercream. First step: \u201cspinach water,\u201d made of blanched spinach blended up and squeezed through a cheesecloth. I then used this pond scum to make a simple syrup, which I brought up to 235\u00b0F. (This I also had to research, frantically Googling, \u201cAt what temperature does sugar syrup form a thread between two spoons?\u201d). I streamed it slowly into egg yolks before adding softened butter, ground pistachios, and, for some reason, kirsch. It was at this point in the process that the entire Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen began to smell so strongly of hot spinach that everyone walking by said aloud, \u201cWhat is that smell?\u201d I promised them the result would be delicious, trying to convince myself the same.Spreading the spinach buttercream over the first layer. The second \u201clayer\u201d is on the bottom right.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigNext, I had to slice the sponge into three layers. This was a fool\u2019s errand: No matter how many videos I watched about how to evenly divide a cake into layers, no matter how many toothpicks I used to mark where the slices should be, no matter how long and sharp my serrated knife, it was impossible. Senior food editors Molly Baz and Chris Morocco, standing nearby, grimaced. I got halfway through trimming off the first paper-thin layer when I decided to turn back and slice the cake in two instead. But this was sort of like deciding halfway through a bob haircut that you actually want a trim. The cake was butchered: The top \u201clayer\u201d was thin shavings of disparate pieces connected by the puniest of crumbs. If I were in the tent, Noel and Sandi would\u2019ve come over to my station at this moment to offer some comedic relief. Instead, I had only the glares from BA\u2019s food editors.There was only one way forward: I smeared the bottom layer with spinach buttercream, pieced the crumbs on top, then covered the whole situation with more of the green stuff, hoping no one would notice that, where there were supposed to be three layers of cake, I had just one and a half. I rolled out the marzipan and draped it over the cake, an extremely satisfying process because it covered the whole mess in a smooth surface\u2014the equivalent of stuffing the cake into Spanx.If an even marzipan cover hides all the mistakes, did they even ever happen?\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigThe final step: fondant. Since I followed a different recipe entirely (forgive me, God), I had no problems. I poured the mixture\u2014melted white chocolate, corn syrup, confectioners\u2019 sugar, water, and leftover spinach water\u2014over the cake and watched it drip down the surface and over the sides in thick ribbons. Now the cake wasn\u2019t only smooth\u2014it was also shiny. The one thing it wasn\u2019t? Very green. The white chocolate muted the spinach\u2019s green into something just shy of white, like the color of my sneakers after one day of wear.Pouring the fondant over top. It should\u2019ve been a vibrant green but, instead, leaned towards off-white.\nPhoto by Chelsie CraigThankfully, festooned with pansies and $50-per-pound Sicilian pistachios, it actually looked presentable. I wouldn\u2019t have been so ashamed to bring it to the judges\u2019 tables.The part where we eat itThe cake sliced nicely: There was a layer of fondant and a layer of marzipan followed by a mash of sponge cake and buttercream.Chris Morocco gave it one look and decided he wouldn\u2019t deign to taste it: G\u00e9noise, he told me, was meant to rise, then be sliced into beautifully discrete layers. Chris, I said to myself (because I would never actually talk back to Chris), I was just (kind of sort of) following the recipe!!! Would the g\u00e9noise have been fluffier, taller, prouder had I used Natasha Pickowicz\u2019s extremely detailed recipe? Why, yes! Did the GBBS bakers have the knowledge and wherewithal to skip Prue\u2019s instructions and go with what they knew to be a better technique? Clearly! With episodes that jump between nearly a dozen contestants, how the heck was I supposed to grasp the sort of wizardry going down when the cameras cut away?It's not so bad but, hey, where are the layers?\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Sarah JampelBut Morocco missed out. Because it tasted\u2026fine! The extreme amount of buttercream in comparison to sponge produced a sweet, tender, and not-at-all dry effect. The marzipan was pleasantly chewy, and the fondant, since it was mostly white chocolate and corn syrup, was candy-like. People liked it! It was nutty and lemony, with no detectable spinach. Some folks at the office even asked to take slices home. Maybe my cake, with its short stature, ill-defined layers, and dirty-white hue, wouldn\u2019t have placed high in terms of looks, but it got the flavor down pat. It lost the swimsuit competition but won the talent segment.So what did I learn, besides the fact that television is deceptive and that spinach is a suitable but stinky natural food coloring? Well, as much as people say baking is about precision, that\u2019s only true if you\u2019re following a recipe you trust. As soon as you sense that something isn\u2019t right\u2014like that sponge cake isn\u2019t going to work if you pour hot butter directly into whipped eggs or that the dough is lumpy when it really should be smooth\u2014that\u2019s when baking becomes about instincts and improvisation. Those contestants aren\u2019t just good bakers, they\u2019re forward-thinking problem-solvers.And on that note, I also learned that I won\u2019t be tossing my hat into the GBBS ring any time soon.Explore Bon App\u00e9titPop CultureCakeRead MoreLifestyleRuby Tandoh On Throwing Out Sick Day Rules and Eating Curry InsteadBy Ruby TandohRecipes you want to make.
