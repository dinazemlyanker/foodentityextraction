To Cancel a Dinner Party If Too Many People Are Paleo?You\u2019ve got dietary restriction questions. We\u2019ve got answers.By Alex BeggsJanuary 18, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailGetty ImagesFacebookTwitterEmailWelcome to \u201cIs It Ever Okay,\u201d Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s etiquette column. Have a question? Email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.When a waiter asks me if I have allergies, and I really dislike cilantro, can I just say cilantro is an allergy? If they clarify if it\u2019s really an allergy, should I stand firm? \u2014Lying LarryI have some THOUGHTS because I am \u201cone of those people\u201d for whom cilantro tastes like soap. My family is deeply embarrassed about it. If I\u2019m ordering tacos, I ask the waiter to hold the cilantro and I can feel the head-shaking shame vibrating off them. If I forget, I take the cilantro off with my own bare hands\u2014it\u2019s NOT A BIG DEAL. And because this is a widely known \u201cgenetic thing,\u201d saying you\u2019re allergic to cilantro is hilariously, obviously, a lie. Plus, the odds of it crashing your party are low. It\u2019s usually right on top! When you know what dish you want to order, ask the waiter to \u201ctell you more about it,\u201d and keep your ears perked for cilantro while they give you the spiel about how the chef gets this really nice radicchio from an underground salad lair farmed by Ninja Turtles. Then order it \u201cwithout the cilantro, please!\u201d ALTERNATE SOLUTION: No matter the cuisine or setting, always add \u201chold the cilantro\u201d to your order. \u201cBut ma\u2019am, it\u2019s a hot \u2018n\u2019 ready.\u201d \u201cBut ma\u2019am, it\u2019s flan.\u201d But sir, it\u2019s called insurance.Hello! I\u2019m curious what you could delight me with for my vegan-candida-cleansing-sweet-tooth self\ud83d\ude33 I apologize in advance\ud83d\ude4f \u2014Apologetic AllisonOh Allison why\u2019d you have to throw this at me. The emojis did help lessen the blow, but damn, this is a restrictive diet that I\u2019m not medically trained in. You\u2019re reducing foods that might be causing yeast infections or other fungal problems I\u2019ll leave to deep WebMD searches. It sounds like cutting processed food, white sugar, and switching to whole grains play the biggest part, but I see other lists online that are terrifyingly militant, cutting all berries and fruit, only allowing for artificial sweeteners\u2014damn! It\u2019s a free country (other than the taxes and cable monopolies), so I\u2019m not going to come over there and rip the Stevia out of your hands on this antifungal journey. BUT I AM GOING TO RECOMMEND A GREAT VEGAN DESSERT!! This citrus with nut crumble uses coconut sugar (allowed? I dunno, this is stressful), and you can eat the crumble by the handful, or sprinkle it everywhere, like on all that seaweed.This vegan Caesar is SO GOOD THO.\nI feel like anchovy is popping up more and more in otherwise vegetarian recipes lately (Ottolenghi I\u2019m looking at you!). What\u2019s the best substitution for anchovy, so I can keep things fish-free? \u2014Mopey MaxAnchovies are AMAZING and yes, they\u2019re everywhere right now, and I like your inclination to blame Ottolenghi, because it shows you\u2019re a cool, in-the-know food person. Maybe you dabble in pomegranate seeds\u2014that\u2019s classy as hell. But depending on where the anchovies are appearing, you could sub capers if you need a hit of brine (like in this vegan Caesar), garlic or onion powder if it\u2019s in a dressing or sauce that needs umami oomph, mushrooms or mushroom powder for funkyness, or cut a piece of potato into a fish shape and let your mind do the work.SNACK BREAKGluten-free carrot cake! Satisfy your sweet tooth, your carrot tooth, and feel proudly gluten-free, whether you\u2019re Celiac or just looking for a dietary answer to your inner troubles!!Gluten-Free Carrot CakeAlmond flour is a wonderfully sweet, nutty complement for fresh carrots, walnuts, and raisins.View RecipeI\u2019m a low-key baker, and I try to be inclusive for people who are gluten-intolerant despite not being so myself. When baking, do I need to simply switch out the recipe\u2019s preferred flour for a gluten-free flour? (I\u2019ve used King Arthur previously.) \u2014Judicious JaredWay to position yourself as the hero here, Jared! Gluten-free flours like King Arthur\u2019s are great for 1:1 subs when you\u2019re turning a regular recipe gluten-free. I talked to Gluten-Free Carrot Cake King Chris Morocco, who likes Bob\u2019s Red Mill GF flour even better. But when Chris developed the carrot cake, he went with almond flour to play off the flavors of the spiced carrots; it was a deliberate choice, and all other ratios in the recipe reflect that flour. (Similarly, you gotta try Alice Medrich\u2019s wonderful oat flour sponge cake). Recipes that call for 5 different flours, worm\u2019s wort, a breath of fresh air, and Xanthan gum are annoying, but it happens.)When you invite people to a dinner party, do you ask them if they have any dietary restrictions, do you expect them to tell you if they don\u2019t eat certain food groups, or do you just prepare a delicious dinner and hope for the best? What does a good host do?  \u2014Gregg\u2019s got a pointI\u2019ve got an answer for every position:Host: Ask your guests WHEN YOU INVITE THEM: \u201cIs there anything you don\u2019t like?\u201d Deal with the answers by adjusting your menu.Guests with an allergy: If the host doesn\u2019t ask, and you\u2019re allergic to mustard seeds, you better fuckin\u2019 tell me. Follow this script. \u201cI\u2019m so excited to come, I\u2019ve heard you\u2019re such an incredible cook and conversationalist, I\u2019d love to bring something\u2014oh, and, I wanted to tell you I\u2019m allergic to mustard seeds. I hope that doesn\u2019t throw a wrench in your beautifully planned menu and beautiful, perfect life!\u201dHost with a guest with an allergy: Come on, you can deal with eliminating an ingredient or two, think of it as a Chopped basket full of EpiPens!Guests who are VEGAN or WHOLE30 or PALEO or KETO: Or whatever very strict diet. Dare I ask that you offer to bring a dish? Gasp! The nerve! These are diets that require you to cook a lot and know the ins and outs and rules and lists like the back of your hand. It can be terrifying and anxiety-inducing for the host who loves you and wants to spend time with you. I\u2019d like to live in a world where home cooks can deal with this like restaurants (mostly) can. But we don\u2019t. If the host is savvy and up for a challenge, they\u2019ll be like, \u201cNah, I got u, I\u2019ll make a big salad! Just bring your cute face and maybe some freaky vegan chocolate or something.\u201d But if they\u2019re going to have to Google every ingredient, help out. You were going to bring wine anyway, right? Bring a Paleo thing, maybe we\u2019ll all dig it and soften our judgy feelings. Bring a whole head of raw broccoli and eat it like cotton candy. Bring a frozen Trader Joe\u2019s thing. It doesn\u2019t have to be a vegan cassoulet.Host with a guest who is VEGAN or WHOLE30 or PALEO or KETO: If they don\u2019t offer to bring something, you could politely ASK. Script: \u201cThat\u2019s awesome! I\u2019m so happy for you, that must be a hard adjustment after 38 years of eating Manwich. I have 14 people coming over, so I was going to make a leg of lamb, would you mind bringing something vegan you\u2019d like to share? I can\u2019t wait to see you!!!\u201dWe just all need to work together here.That\u2019s all for now, but if you have petty etiquette questions or recipe requests for me, email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com and be too specific.
