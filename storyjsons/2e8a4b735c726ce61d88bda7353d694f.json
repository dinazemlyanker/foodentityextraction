And while whipping up a loaf of sourdough on a Tuesday is wildly ambitious and, frankly, totally inadvisable, flatbread, on the other hand, is downright easy. You don\u2019t even have to turn on your oven! It\u2019s a low-commitment bread for busy and impatient people, and thus perfect for weeknights, impromptu dinner parties, and any other time you feel like eating it.Chris Morocco\u2019s low-key whole wheat flatbread recipe (inspired by chef Josh McFadden\u2019s yogurt flatbreads from Bon Appetit\u2019s August 2015 issue), uses whole-milk yogurt to create a complex, tangy flavor similar to\u2014but again, much easier than!\u2014sourdough bread. It only needs five ingredients and twenty minutes of your time. Start by quickly whisking together whole wheat flour, salt, baking powder, and all-purpose flour, then add in the whole-milk yogurt. Resist the temptation to use Greek yogurt, which will throw off the ratio of dry to wet ingredients and keep the dough from hydrating properly.Once the yogurt is incorporated, knead the dough with your hands until it\u2019s mostly smooth, which should take about a minute. Divide the dough into two places and wrap them in plastic, then set them aside for 15 minutes. (This is called \u201cresting\u201d the dough, and it will make it easier to roll.)Next comes the fun part: rolling out the flatbreads. Take a moment to dust your work surface with some all-purpose flour, which will prevent the dough from sticking to your countertop. Then, working one at a time, roll out the dough until it\u2019s as thick as two stacked quarters (a.k.a. \u215b inch). Use a clean wine bottle if a rolling pin hasn\u2019t made its way into your kitchen arsenal, and don\u2019t stress if the flatbreads aren\u2019t perfectly round. Lopsided flatbreads are still very delicious!Once both flatbreads are rolled out, heat a medium cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Cook flatbread until underside is golden brown and puffy with a few charred spots, about two minutes, then turn and cook the other side until it\u2019s golden brown, about a minute longer. Transfer to a plate, then repeat with remaining dough.It\u2019s tempting to devour these flatbreads when they\u2019re straight out of the skillet, but adding toppings will make them even more delicious. We love to pile on tender cauliflower and tofu, but they\u2019re also a natural base for jammy eggs, peak-season tomatoes, and random leftovers. The power of flatbread transforms all\u2014and with all the ingredients already tucked away in your pantry, a fresh batch is never far away.Make this flatbread recipe tonight:Easy Flatbread with Cauliflower and TofuChef Josh McFadden\u2019s crazy-simple yogurt flatbreads from Bon Appetit\u2019s August 2015 issue inspired this whole-grain version.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyHealthyishFlatbreadFeel Good Food PlanRead MoreLifestyleBlack Lentils Are the Best Lentil for Meal Prep, PeriodBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
