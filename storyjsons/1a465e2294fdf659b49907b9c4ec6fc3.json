You Can Make Ice CreamBabysitters and elementary school science teachers know.By Kendra VaculinDecember 20, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhotograph by Josephine Schiele. Food Styling by Rebecca JurkevichFacebookTwitterEmailOne of my favorite pastimes as a child was lying to my babysitters about what we were allowed to do when my parents were out. We could definitely use the camcorder to film a home movie pretending we were spies. They wouldn\u2019t mind at all if I stayed up until 10:30 PM watching the Brandy Cinderella on ABC Family. And, crucially, it was 100% permitted to put on aprons and make dessert, I swear, seriously, I pinkie promise.Most sitters met me somewhere in the middle, which meant half the movie and no-bake treats. Peanut butter buckeyes were a favorite, as well as those oat-and-chocolate drop cookies that firm up in the freezer, when I could wait that long. Then one day, a favorite ex-pre-school teacher named Karen came over with a bag of rock salt and totally changed the game. With some basic ingredients and no fancy machinery, she taught my sister and me how to make ice cream in a bag.The process is quite simple: Fill a small zip-top bag with cold ice cream ingredients (heavy cream, half-and-half, sugar, and whatever flavorings you\u2019d like), then seal and place that inside of a larger, gallon-sized freezer bag filled with ice and a bit of rock salt. After shaking the bag vigorously for 10\u201312 minutes, you end up with scoopable, creamy, perfectly-set ice cream ready to eat from the interior bag. As a second-grader, this was the closest thing to magic I\u2019d ever experienced, especially when Karen let us raid my mom\u2019s sprinkle collection to adorn our final bowls; years later, as a babysitter myself, I revisited the project to the same wide-eyed appreciation (mine and the kids\u2019).The two-bag method works because of the combination of salt and ice. Salt causes the ice in the bag to melt at a lower temperature than usual (if you\u2019ve sprinkled salt on an icy sidewalk, you know the drill), keeping everything much colder for longer. This way, the ingredients stay super frigid while smooshed and rattled and the ice cream is good to go straight out of the bag, with no freezer wait time at the end. The result is a little less rich than conventional ice cream (there\u2019s no eggy custard base), but that\u2019s a fair trade for not having to break out the ice cream machine or hand-crank churn.There\u2019s a lot of room for riffing on the ice cream ingredients to make the final scoop entirely your own. For the holiday season, nothing beats a little peppermint extract, red food coloring stripes, and crunched-up candy canes spooned over top, but any flavor extract, final touches, and mix-ins will work beautifully. I remember a particularly transcendent vanilla ice cream that was bright purple (thanks to a few drops of dye in the bag pre-shake) with mini chocolate chips.I will say, no ten minutes have ever felt longer than those spent shaking a very cold plastic bag. To make it more fun (and keep your hands from freezing), I recommend wearing oven mitts, shaking outside in case of drips, and putting on some music, so you can shimmy and dance around to pass the time and keep it moving. You can even toss the bag back and forth between multiple people, like a game of Antarctic hot potato.\u00a0Ultimately, though, every shiver will be worth it; whether you manage to spoon it into a bag or simply snip off a corner to squeeze the ice cream Go-Gurt style straight into your mouth, it\u2019s a no-mess, no oven, super-fast treat that is, I swear, I pinkie promise, totally babysitter-approved.Get the recipe!Candy Cane Ice Cream in a BagMake ice cream without an ice cream machine using this zip-top bag and rock salt trick.
