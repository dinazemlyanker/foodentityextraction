I was super sick for many years, struggling with chronic inflammation and fighting a so-called \u201cincurable\u201d autoimmune disease. I got so far down  the path of illness that the writing was on the wall: Change or die. So I changed. I changed my relationship with food, I changed how I approached cooking, and I applied the years of skills I had developed as a professional chef to making healthy food taste delicious.This turmeric yogurt dip is a perfect example of how I like to use nutrient-dense ingredients like ginger, turmeric, yogurt, and olive oil in a way that doesn\u2019t punch you in the face with \u201chealthy.\u201d Make it in the morning before work, let the ingredients get to know each other in the fridge, and come home to a super flavorful dish. The delicate, warming flavor of turmeric contrasts with the cooling cucumber and creamy yogurt.I\u2019m not one of those cooks who eats an amazing meal then tries as hard as I can to recreate it once I get home, but I love to find elements of a dish and reimagine them in new and different ways. I remember eating raw bok choi in Chiang Rai in the far north of Thailand\u2014it was something so obvious that it seems silly I had never thought of it before. Nearly 16 years later, I\u2019m still playing with new ways to integrate it into my cooking, like as a vessel for  this dip. It has the scoopable quality of celery with just enough crunch, plenty of water, and virtually none of the annoying stringiness. It\u2019s one of the all time vegetable champs! Of course,  you could also serve this yogurt dip alongside grilled lamb, lamb burgers, or any vegetables from the market. It\u2019s ridiculously easy and delicious, and it\u2019s perfect for a spring refresh.It's dip season:Turmeric Yogurt DipVigorously squeezing the cucumbers to remove as much water as possible helps to concentrate their flavor and creates a thicker dip.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titTurmericCrudite DipHealthyishYogurtDipRead MorecookingPoach Your Eggs in Chicken Stock\u2014Just Trust UsBy Seamus MullenRecipes you want to make.
