It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.People ask me all the time if working at Bon App\u00e9tit is as fun as it looks in our videos, and the answer is yes. I just got back from a 10-day trip to sunny California to promote my cookbook, and I actually missed my coworkers. That\u2019s not supposed to happen! But if you\u2019re going to spend more time at the office than you do anywhere else, you need to love the people you work with, and I love the heck out of these people.I think that\u2019s why I laughed so hard throughout the filming of our new five-part video series, \u201cMaking Perfect Pizza,\u201d which is the first time that the entire Bon App\u00e9tit food team has ever worked together to create one single recipe. Lucky for you, we caught it on tape.Doesn\u2019t that look good?\nPhoto by Molly BazWant this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!For the new series, which is now streaming on your TV through our Bon App\u00e9tit channel, we formed a many-headed kitchen monster to devise perfect recipes for all of the components that go into making the ultimate pizza, from the charred crust on the bottom to the fresh basil fluttering on top. In the first episode (which is now available on YouTube), Claire Saffitz tackles the dough, then hands off to Brad Leone and Andy Baraghani, who tasted dozens of canned San Marzano tomatoes in their quest for the most delicious pizza sauce. (The winning brand will definitely surprise you.) Molly and I felt it was important to go all the way to Campania, Italy, to taste and make fresh mozzarella cheese\u2014and in the third episode you can see us do exactly that, then hit rock bottom as we try to recreate what we learned back in the test kitchen (with jetlag, to boot). Don\u2019t worry, we nailed it before passing the baton to Chris Morocco and Andy to go to work on toppings. I\u2019m still mad that they rejected both spicy sausage and n\u2019duja.Photo by Alex LauFor the final episode, we drove up to Connecticut to cook in an actual wood-burning oven (at my parent\u2019s house!) and take votes on the final pie. Behind the scenes, there was some Survivor-ish alliance-building in the works, but the final pie was a unanimous winner.If you think great minds think alike, you\u2019re wrong\u2014we judged, we needled, and we pushed each other during each phase of development, the same way it always works when there\u2019s a new recipe in the works. But my coworkers are.Get the recipe:Bon App\u00e9tit's \"Making Perfect\" PizzaWith the amount of love, time, and research that went into making what constitutes the \u201cperfect\u201d pizza, you\u2019ll definitely want to share.
