The toppings. The location. The drink. It all matters. Maybe even too much.By Alex DelanyMarch 7, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailEating a slice of pizza is kind of like taking a shower: everyone does it, but not in exactly the same way.I\u2019m not going to say that I\u2019ve eaten more slices of pizza than I have taken showers (because that might be gross), but the tally is probably closer than you\u2019d think. Living in New York, slices are a huge part of life, whether they\u2019re eaten at 2:00 a.m. on Saturday night, out of the fridge at 10:00 a.m. the next morning, or in the fifteen minute window between meetings on a Tuesday afternoon. If you walk down any block in New York, you will see someone eating a slice.Which brings me back to the procedure. The fold. The toppings. The location. The grease. The beverage. They\u2019re all handled in accordance with personal preference. And while no method is ever wrong, I\u2019d love to share my favorite way to get the perfectly balanced bite.\u00a0The only tools you need to eat pizza.\nPhoto by Alex LauA Quick Note About Forks and KnivesPut them down. Don\u2019t ask for them. I like to eat a slice of pizza with my hand or hands. The only exception would be a soggy Neapolitan pie, but you should keep reading, because there\u2019s a method for that that doesn\u2019t involve utensils.How to Fold Your SliceThe initial decision is how you hold your slice, more specifically, the way you fold it. Also, I feel like this is a good time to mention that I did not realize how exposed my chest was in this photoshoot, AND I AM TOTALLY FINE WITH IT. Here are a few approaches to folding a slice:This slice cannot support the Wide Open Plain, so The Flop ensues\nPhoto by Alex LauThe Wide Open Plain (AKA the Non-Fold)Some slices have a crust that\u2019s rigid enough to hold the weight of a small child, or at least the weight of the cheese and sauce on top of it. This slice doesn\u2019t want or need the help of a fold or crimp. The non-fold does not work great with slices that contain a magnitude of toppings or slices that have a more delicate foundation.The FlopSpeaking of more delicate slices, if you hold a slice without bending the crust, the tip will droop. In this scenario, you can hold the slice higher than your face and let it fall right into your mouth like a pizza waterfall.\u00a0Photo by Alex LauThe CrimpA slight bend in the crust, created with pressure from your thumb and middle finger (below the crust) and your pointer finger (above the crust) gives a partial bend in the crust, creating a structural triangle. A triangle is the strongest shape\u2014I took geometry in 10th grade. I remember this. Look at bridges. There are lots of triangles happening on bridges\u2014so this gives your slice more support and prohibits flopping and the dripping of grease. It also allows you to maintain eye contact with your toppings, so you can plot your course. The crimp isn\u2019t necessary, but it\u2019s guaranteed improve your slice experience.The mark of a true professional\nPhoto by Alex LauThe Crust TacoThis is the dark horse of the pizza-folding universe, and in my opinion, the most important fold you\u2019ll ever perform. Crust is better with sauce and cheese on it. That\u2019s why I will always stop short of the crust when eating my slice, leaving a little strip of cheese and sauce that\u2019s equal in width to the crust. I then fold the sauce and cheese strip toward the crust, until they meet, joining the crust and the proper pizza into one glorious, collaborative experience.Photo by Alex LauThe Pizza SpliffAt a late night slice pit stop, I recently saw someone roll their slice from crust to point, creating a pizza-taquito-joint type thing. I don\u2019t really know if this is something that people do or what. But if you subscribe to this philosophy, you probably don\u2019t really care what I have to say, so...carry on.The wallet fold isn\u2019t great for an American slice\nPhoto by Alex LauThe Pizza Wallet (AKA the Neapolitan Fold)I was recently watching the pizza episode of Netflix\u2019s Ugly Delicious, where Lucali\u2019s Mark Iacono employed the wallet fold. He folded the tip of his slice back into the center and pressed together the sides, to create a sealed pouch. This technique is prime for a super floppy slice, but not the best on your typical Italian-American slice, because the crust is less pliable. Exhibit A: The photo above.Photo by Alex LauTable ToppingsThese last minute additions can make or break a slice of pizza, so lets see what we\u2019re working with.Red Pepper FlakesRed pepper flakes are the Lebron James or the Serena Williams or Meryl Streep of the 11th hour pizza topping game. They are all the best in the history of their respective fields. I will put red pepper flakes on my slice 93.3% of the time. The 6.7% of the time I do not is if the slice already has a spice component. That little bit of dry heat is exactly what a plain slice is asking for.Garlic SaltPizza sauce (the good stuff, at least) already has garlic and salt in it. But that doesn\u2019t mean a litle sprinkle can\u2019t help a slice with under-seasoned or over-sweetened sauce.Dried OreganoDried oregano lends an herbal, earthy, vegetal quality to a slice that can boost umami to marvelous levels, but it\u2019s all about proportion. For extra control, try shaking the oregano into your hand, and sprinkle from there.\u00a0ParmesanParm is a fantastic cheese, but the Parm that most slice spots stock may not be. If you want a little diversity in the cheese flavor, I\u2019ll cosign a table Parm flurry.Freshly Ground Black Pepperlack pepper is the most underrated table topping in the game, especially when it comes to a white slice. Think about how much you love cacio e pepe. Now think about turning your pizza into cacio e pepe. That pepper needs to be freshly ground though.Photo by Alex LauDRANKSMy two favorite beverages to drink with a slice are Lambrusco (which is pizza pro approved) or Coca-Cola. Diet Coke works too. You want something fizzy, sweet, and light-bodied to wash down bite after glorious bite. If you don\u2019t like Coke or Lambrusco, well, I\u2019ll widen the field to soda or juicy, light-bodied red wine or that trendy seltzer you love so much.\u00a0Location, Location, LocationThis is an opinion based on zero quantifiable data, but slices usually taste better when you\u2019re standing up. Sitting down for a slice is going to inspire a nap (unless you\u2019re sitting at an open air table). There\u2019s something about the brief, casual, barely-broke-your-stride mentality that comes along with a slice which makes it special, so if you can stand up while devouring your slices, do it. Eat them at a counter, on the sidewalk, or even better, at a counter on the sidewalk. Sidewalk counters are special.Wow. You read that whole thing?
