But which is the best Greek yogurt for cooking? I fell for Wallaby Organic Whole Milk Greek Yogurt, made out of California. It\u2019s shiny, silky, bouncy, and tart\u2014with a lot of lusciousness and none of the chalkiness found in some other brands. The official Wallaby website credits their \u201cunhurried\u201d culturing process for the buoyant texture, and claims their yogurt is \u201cauthentically\u201d strained to achieve a \u201cdeliciously thick\u201d result. I don\u2019t know enough about how it\u2019s made to confirm or deny these claims, but I can tell you that, based on my empirical research, this yogurt is excellent for cooking, and I'd eat it straight too.When the grocery delivery service that we use in the BA test kitchen started carrying the brand, we began using it in recipe development on a regular basis, and slowly but surely new converts were won. Senior food editor Andy Baraghani, a world-renowned yogurt connoisseur (he is known for putting yogurt into every single recipe he develops) is a fan. \u201cIt is super silky, with good richness and tang,\u201d he says, \u201cand you don\u2019t need to thin it as much for sauce as you do with thicker yogurts.\u201d Try it in one of his yogurt-forward dips: He recommends it in this minty number, or this colorful sauce that is perfect alongside rice.Senior food editor Chris Morocco, man of the golden palate, had this to say: \u201cIt\u2019s achieves the perfect synergy between tanginess, creaminess, and the complete absence of chalkiness.\u201d I\u2019d just like to point out that anyone who uses the word synergy in a regular sentence is not to be questioned. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, Morocco is bold enough to compare Wallaby to the incomparable White Moustache Persian yogurt, saying it was the closest a mass-produced yogurt would likely ever get.In sum, Wallaby is the best Greek yogurt for cooking because of three key attributes: tanginess, silkiness, and not-too-thickness. Wallaby blends easily into dressings and smoothies because of its texture. Because it doesn\u2019t have to be thinned out to be pourable or dip-able, its tartness stays undiluted\u2014you could just add a pinch of salt and call it a sauce and no one would blink twice. I usually go for the full-fat, but even at 2%, it retains its glossy richness: a quality I have appreciated many times while eating it with a drizzle of maple syrup, standing up at my kitchen counter.Buy Wallaby Organic Greek Yogurt on Fresh Direct, $7.99Try some more recipes that make yogurt the star:Turmeric Fried Eggs with Kale, Yogurt, and BaconBreakfast bowls shouldn\u2019t take 2 hours to make; this one is ready in about 20 minutes.View RecipeSpiced Dal with Fluffy Rice and Salted YogurtIn this dish, lentils get a double dose of tartness from lime-marinated red onion and a drizzle of tangy yogurt.View RecipeSpiced Chickpeas with Crispy Pita, Yogurt, and Brown ButterThis version of the Levantine breakfast dish, known as fatteh hummus, is all about the contrast of textures and flavors: crunchy pita chips, creamy chickpeas, and tart yogurt.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titYogurtGreek YogurtRead Morecooking8 Reasons Why Molly Yeh Loves Yogurt More Than LIFEBy Molly YehRecipes you want to make.
