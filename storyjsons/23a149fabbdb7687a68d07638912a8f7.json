I even tear them in half, select-a-sizing my select-a-size. I stretch those towels thin. I\u2019m trying not to use so much paper, but I still feel completely dependent on them. My cat...barfs a lot.And that\u2019s something I\u2019ll never clean with the square reusable paper towel flopped over the side of my sink.My new Swedish dishcloth\u2014beloved and highly rated by many\u2014is made of cotton and cellulose, which is an \u201cinsoluble substance,\u201d a definition that hasn\u2019t really cleared anything up for me. It absorbs, I guess??? This is the kind of product I\u2019d see eco-influencers using on Instagram and think, hmmmm. They\u2019re getting paid to promote this. It\u2019s too cute to trust. Have you seen the patterned ones?! So I gave in! It didn\u2019t hurt!When splatters of coffee on the counter need a swipe, I grab it. When showers of oil coat the stovetop, I attack them with it. It\u2019s a wet cloth! It works!Like any new habit, it took some getting used to. When it was soaked from constant use (it gets rinsed and wrung but remains perpetually wet), I didn\u2019t want to use it, all cold and soggy. Kinda gross. But that\u2019s a fact of reusable towel life. I also had to accept that the bright white and lemon-patterned square from the online photo became gray and stained immediately. Like all descendants of Adam and Eve, it will never go back to pristine. But I can throw it in the wash (dishwasher or laundry) to keep it from getting grosser. When it gets too repulsive to touch or deteriorates, I\u2019ll compost it with my carrot stubs. Life goes on.So that\u2019s not much to complain about. I\u2019m definitely using paper towels less than I was before, and I feel good about that dent. But when my cat pukes from eating too fast (ugh, ROGER) or when an oily onion fleck flings to the floor, I\u2019ll still go for paper towels. A tiny square-of-a-square of paper towel is gonna happen. I can\u2019t beat myself up about that kind of stuff.And maybe you\u2019re thinking\u2014or you\u2019re my sister and you\u2019re saying this over the phone\u2014couldn\u2019t you use a washcloth instead? Maybe the sponge that\u2019s already there? Oh. Yeahhhh. YES. 100 PERCENT. Why wasn\u2019t I doing that all along? And we\u2019re back to square one.DII Swedish Dishcloth Set Cleaning Collection$17 at Amazon (set of 3)Explore Bon App\u00e9titI Gave InCleaningShoppingRecipes you want to make.
