Get all his recipes, tips, and stories here.When I was in my teens, old enough to drive myself around, I would rarely would go straight home after school. I needed a snack and a few smokes, and my go-to was a chicken schwarma and a pack of Camels. I\u2019d go to a place whose name I\u2019ll never remember. It was always kind of a mess in there but it smelled like heaven: slowly cooking meat and all the spices from a souk. The meat was always a touch dry, and the bread could be on the stale side, but what kept me coming back to this little storefront was the intensely garlicky, bright, white sauce on the schwarma that tied the whole thing together. When I requested some extra yogurt sauce to smother my chicken in, I was quickly informed that the sauce I craved was not made from yogurt, nor was it even dairy-based, but, rather, an emulsion made from garlic, oil, lemon, and salt. So began my love for toum.Years later, after eating many shawarmas with toum, I finally made a trip to Lebanon where I saw a big batch of the sauce being made. Garlic was pulsed to a fine paste before oil and lemon juice were slowly streamed in and the sauce emulsified. A bit of water thinned it out, and a palmful of salt finished it. What happened before my eyes was magic: the texture became fluffier and lighter than mayonnaise and it turned bleach white. One taste of its pungent garlic flavor was so intense, you\u2019d have the aftertaste for days.When I came back to New York, I tried to make the sauce in a mortar and pestle and failed miserably. But when I was creating my guide to Middle Eastern food, I knew I couldn\u2019t leave toum out. I had to learn exactly how it was done.I quickly learned that it\u2019s much easier to make a big batch of toum than a cup. I also learned that a blender is the best way to make sure the garlic and the oil thicken into that perfect, white sauce. Third, I learned to keep all the liquids\u2014the oil, the water, and the lemon juice\u2014as cold as possible to help with the emulsifying.Toum\u2019s aggressive flavor is best paired with ingredients that can compete\u2014grilled meats are the obvious choice, but the sauce can be mashed into charred eggplant to make a dip or drizzled over roasted vegetables. Anything that needs a hit of garlic and acid will be better with toum.And I\u2019m thankful for that mediocre schwarma shop for showing me the (white, super-pungent) light.Toum goes great with sweet potatoes:Charred Sweet Potatoes With ToumThis recipe is nice twice. The roasting and honey-glazing method is a great way to make sweet potatoes, and you also get an eggless garlic sauce that you\u2019ll use again and again.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishGarlicYogurtMiddle EasternLebaneseRead MorecookingMy Guide to Modern Middle Eastern CookingGallery10 SlidesBy Andy BaraghaniRecipes you want to make.
