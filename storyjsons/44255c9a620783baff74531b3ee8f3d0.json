Yogurt containers are used as storage. You\u2019re served double the food that you actually have room to eat. And the servingware is made of stainless steel.For most of my life, I always thought my family\u2019s stainless steel stuff was lame. They represented my Indian parents\u2019 sense of practicality; they were cheap, dishwasher-safe, and easy to cram into our kitchen drawers. My mom\u2019s nice pottery was only for special occasions. Monday through Friday, stainless steel dominated the dinner table\u2014our dal and our yogurt would go into two tiny stainless steel containers, and everything else (the sabzi, the salad, the roti, the rice) would go on stainless steel plates. Bo-ring.Then, I moved into my first apartment and acquired two nice wooden bowls, which promptly cracked and faded in the dishwasher (oops) and imbued everything with a weird damp log taste. I splurged on a ceramic bowl too. It chipped within two weeks.On a trip back to Dallas about a year ago, my mom, having seen the lack of serving vessels in my New York apartment, suggested that I take home some of her stainless steel prep bowls that couldn\u2019t have been more than three inches wide and four inches tall\u2014we call them katoris. They were small and lightweight, so I stuffed a few into my carry-on.In no time at all, those katoris became the most-used items in my kitchen. One was my new salt crock. I made quick salad dressings and dipping sauce for dumplings in another. They perfectly fit a single scoop of ice cream, or my morning yogurt drizzled with honey and walnuts. My boyfriend, who bakes quite a bit, started hogging them for measuring out small amounts of chocolate and sugar on his digital scale. We would drop them on the floor frequently and they never broke. We could stack a bunch of them into our tiny dishwasher, and store them in our tiny cabinets. I started to realize that maybe my parents were onto something.A few months later, we photographed my cookbook, Indian-ish, at my parents\u2019 house. We shot all of the dishes on my mom\u2019s best pottery, acquired from years of business trips around the world\u2014leaf-shaped serving trays from the Philippines! A speckled, black-and-white bowl from Tasmania! We spent hours carefully laying out each dish on the dining table so that our photographer, Mackenzie, and stylist, Judy, could select the right one for the shot. One day, they were looking for utensils, and they stumbled upon the drawer full of stainless steel plates and bowls.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you put these out with the rest of the servingware?\u201d Mackenzie asked me.\u201cI don\u2019t know. Those are what we eat food off of every day. They\u2019re just not that special,\u201d I replied.Immediately, Mackenzie grabbed a plate, dolloped some chutney on it, placed it on set, and took a test shot. I glanced at the computer screen, and to my surprise, the stainless steel plates looked amazing on camera. They gleamed and glistened. They reflected light beautifully. They made the colors of the food pop. She and Judy couldn\u2019t believe my mom and I had been holding it out on them.We ended up shooting a good portion of the recipes on those plates. It felt right, in a way. The book is about my family and how we eat on a regular basis. Those stainless steel plates and bowls are as everyday as it gets for us. And who knew they would look so luxurious in harsh, highly saturated lighting?!A few days ago, Judy texted us that she had gone on a stainless steel shopping spree at her local Indian store. As for me, it took some time to come to this realization, but I\u2019m through with eating my weeknight dal chawal on pricey pottery. Now, every time to head home to Dallas, I pack light: I want to save room for all the katoris I\u2019ll be tossing in my bag to take back with me.Buy it: Stainless Steel Katori (Set of six, 2.75 inches diameter), $9 on AmazonAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
