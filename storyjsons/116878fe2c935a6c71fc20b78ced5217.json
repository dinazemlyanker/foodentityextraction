Enjoy it all with Terraza Cha Cha Ch\u00e1\u2019s stunning terrace view of the Monumento a la Revoluci\u00f3n.ORDER THE: seafood, of course! There are cooling ceviches and aguachiles as well as fantastic tacos and tostadas. Don\u2019t skip on the meat though, like the suckling pig\u2019s chamorro, which comes with confit pig leg, cactus salad, pico de gallo, salsa ranchera, and handmade tortillas. And order at least one of the homemade desserts.THE VIBE IS: airy, unpretentious, and fresh. The attention to detail in the design is apparent through art deco architecture, abundance of greenery, and the intimate setup with striking views.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day: Monday to Saturday, from 1 p.m. to 1:30 a.m., and Sunday, from 1 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. The terrace tables are in high demand, so if you want optimal views, make a reservation at least four days prior. That said, the inside is gorgeous too.Photo courtesy of Terraza Cha Cha Ch\u00e1Photo courtesy of Terraza Cha Cha Ch\u00e1WE ALSO LOVEPujolThe restaurant that put Mexican fine dining on the world stage keeps evolvingContramarGrilled fish, palomas, and good vibes for any occasionQuintonilThe place where you realize that ant larvae really *are* a delicacyExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
