Now It\u2019s Your Turn.Two great new recipes, one great old one, and Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s\u2026wedding registry?By Alex BeggsSeptember 28, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Marcus Nilsson, Food Styling by Frances Boswell, Prop Styling by Amy WilsonFacebookTwitterEmailEvery Friday morning, Bon App\u00e9tit senior staff writer Alex Beggs shares weekly highlights from the BA offices, from awesome new recipes to office drama to restaurant recs, with some weird (food!) stuff she saw on the internet thrown in. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Fun with mushroomsSorry Michael Pollan, not that kind. This is a family newsletter. And for my family (a cat, an aunt), I made Andy Baraghani\u2019s new creamy mushroom pasta this week. Even with \u00bc cup cream instead of \u00bd (my inside sources tell me Andy tried to get away with 1 cup), it was perfect. Even more perfect with a sprinkling of red pepper flakes.Make it!

Sign up for our newsletter!Photo by Chelsie Craig, food styling by Rebecca JurkevichAnother thing I madeBoth Christina Chaey and I made Claire Saffitz\u2019s apple cake, though I went with pecans instead of walnuts in the nutty batter (my favorite cake batter in recent BA history). Chaey\u2019s apples (Jonamac) were high in water and sunk, but mine (Honeycri$p) didn\u2019t. This spurred discussion about the best apples for baking. A tip from Claire when you\u2019re shopping for them: you\u2019re looking for HARD, dense apples that\u2019ll hold their shape, so if you press your thumb into it and it doesn\u2019t indent, you\u2019re good. If it does indent, you better buy that one and eat it as a snack. Above: the recipe photo. Below: Chaey\u2019s (left) and mine (right).Copyright 2019. All rights reserved.Bake it! Apple-Walnut Upside-Down CakeBlankiesA lot of readers screamed \u201cbed bugs!\u201d \u201ccooties!\u201d when I professed my obsession with restaurant blankets. I just want to let y\u2019all know that the restaurants dry clean the blankets often, please chill. If you get too chill, warm up with a nice brushed-cotton blanket at Angler in San Francisco!So exciting, so overwhelmingAs someone generally interesting in poring over your wedding registry and picturing what life is like inside of other people\u2019s homes and hearts, the dropping of Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s supposed wedding registry on Amazon was a huge moment in my week. It just felt so...fake. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s real, corporate overlords who make affiliate money from Amazon! The cheery, first-person copy-writing (\u201cCooking for two is always more fun!\u201d) was missing that famous Jennifer Lawrence snap. Is that A COPPER FONDUE SET? I just want to let you know, for everything you click on and buy from this registry (consider a copper fondue set), Bon App\u00e9tit will make a cut. So please, I\u2019m begging you, consider a copper fondue set.Photo by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiIt\u2019s nug seasonA reader (Hi Taylor Kidd!) tagged me recently sharing a gleeful home scene starring POTATO NUGS, a.k.a. the best recipe from our Thanksgiving issue last year. Steam-roasted, pub-style potatoes that have the texture of a deep-fried cloud. Taylor, I believe, covered them in gravy, which is just gilding the lily. This is a PSA to remind you it is now burnished potato nugget season; act accordingly.Get the recipe: Burnished Potato NuggetsPhoto by The Voorhes for The New YorkerTell me more about WilburIt took me three days, but Tad Friend\u2019s 6-month reporting on the Impossible Burger (and other new meat alternatives) in The New Yorker was riveting and I hope you read it too. I\u2019d earlier dismissed Impossible thinking, \u201cThey send me too many press releases, I don\u2019t trust that,\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s high in all the bad-for-you artery-clogging ways meat is, why don\u2019t I just eat beans,\u201d but now I get it more fully, and it\u2019s nice to realize your rigid convictions are probably, at least a little bit, wrong. \u201cHe has a potbellied pig named Wilbur at home that knows how to open the refrigerator\u201d is an out-of-context quote I\u2019ll leave for you here.Recipe comment of the weekOn Claire\u2019s cake.Unnecessary food meme of the weekSpecial edition! This is Sarah Jampel\u2019s \u201cfavorite meme\u201d but otherwise, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand them.\u201dUnnecessary food feud of the weekAlex LauUnnecessary food feud of the weekThe markets are stocked with heavy winter squashes and cute little honeynuts\u2014but why are there only four Bon App\u00e9tit spaghetti squash recipes? A friend made it recently for me in a cheesy gratin. \u201cI like it, especially given the cacio e pepe treatment [pictured above]\u201d said food director Carla Lalli Music, \u201cbut not as a noodle alternative.\u201d Soooo where are the RECIPES, CARLA? \u201cThis isn\u2019t a keto magazine,\u201d she replied. Ouch. Emily Schultz hasn\u2019t eaten it since she roasted, shredded, and covered it in jarred pasta sauce in college. Seems for the best. Sarah Jampel lamented, \u201cI was served spaghetti squash at a restaurant last night, underneath spicy cauliflower. I wish it weren\u2019t there!\u201d She backtracked to tell me she likes it \u201cin general.\u201d Sure. \u201cIt\u2019s great for babies,\u201d said Meryl Rothstein, \u201cbecause you don\u2019t have to cut anything.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the worst of all squash, hate it!\u201d said Sohla El-Waylly, who finds it \u201cwatery, bland, and stringy.\u201d A staffer who prefers to remain anonymous to avoid retaliation DMed me: \u201cIt\u2019s f****** disgusting!\u201d Another nameless staffer pointed to her father, the last remaining person on the Atkins diet, who looooves it as a pasta alternative. \u201cAll the butter and Parm in the world can\u2019t save it because nothing can,\u201d concluded Chris Morocco. I won\u2019t string this along any further.Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorerestaurantsI\u2019d Love a Blankie With My Meal, ThanksBy Alex BeggscookingThis One Rule Separates Good Baking Apples From The LosersBy Sarah JampelcookingClaire Saffitz Made the Apple Cake of Our DreamsBy Sarah Jampelrecipes7 Recipes to Get You Through Every Cooking Scenario This FallGallery7 SlidesBy Andy Baraghani and Chris MoroccoRecipes you want to make.
