To Take Home the Wine You Brought to a Party?No one drank it, and you would like to drink it. But-but-but-nooooo.By Alex BeggsDecember 14, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Fine Art Images/Heritage Images/Getty ImagesFacebookTwitterEmailWelcome to \u201cIs It Ever Okay,\u201d Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s etiquette column. Have a question? Email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.If you are hosting a dinner party and invite each guest to bring a +1, how do you handle a guest who brings someone you absolutely HATE? \u2014Hateful NateI dunno, serve them arsenic-laced wine? Depends on what level on your Hate Scale they\u2019re at. But if you want absolute control over your dinner party, invite all of your American Girl dolls instead and leave humanity out of it. I have a friend who had the gall to marry a man I can\u2019t stand. He likes to interrogate, quiz, and patronize you instead of \u201chold a normal conversation.\u201d I\u2019m not sure where he learned this technique, but I blame the Boy Scouts. Our last chat ended with me saying, \u201cWell I\u2019ve had enough of this!\u201d Really, he\u2019s harmless, but I\u2019ve decided to hate him for annoying me so much. So I feel you there. When he inevitably comes over, I treat him civilly, like an alien from the planet Mansplainia on a tourism board sponsored press trip to see how we normies live. That is, if there\u2019s any interaction at all (it\u2019s amazing how movement works, you can just...walk away!). Then I talk mad shit the second he leaves. It\u2019s cathartic! This is why post-party debriefs are as essential as the party itself. Let it out.If someone does something nice for you, like watch your dog or water your plants, while you\u2019re out of town, what is an acceptable gift to give them? Wine, food, a small ceramic something, etc.? And what if you\u2019re broke as a joke? \u2014Cashless CarrieYou own a dog or some bougie succulents? You can afford a thank you present. It should be a gift certificate to the nearest grocery store in the range of $25\u2013$100, depending on how many days you were lazing on a beach somewhere, and whether they sang the entire Phantom of the Opera playbook to the plants. If you know this person is a wino, get wine, but who knows if they want that leather booty malbec anyway! Also I\u2019m not into the souvenir gift. This person got near your poodle\u2019s poop\u2014that\u2019s gross. That\u2019s more than a favor. They don\u2019t want a pound of eerily familiar fudge. This is why I like the grocery store gift certificate, especially to Trader Joe\u2019s, because it says: practical. Practically...cash.Thanks for bringing wine! Now LEAVE IT.\nPhoto by Alexandra GavilletPlease settle the proper etiquette when bringing beer/wine to a friend\u2019s dinner party. I always leave the bottle behind as payment for the food, but I\u2019ve had friends take theirs back or split a six pack. I think that\u2019s rude, but I\u2019m also upset to see the liter of natural wine I brought to a friend\u2019s house sit unopened for months. \u2014 Thirsty EmilyI love how often \u201cnatural wine\u201d as a concept comes up in this column. Why is natural wine so linked with asshole-ish behavior? Curious, curious. Anyway, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to call out my boyfriend\u2019s friend Lock, who used to come over to watch Michigan football every weekend for like three years in a row (it felt like). Bill, my guy, would make elaborate bro feasts: chili, pulled pork, all kinds of Midwestern comfort foods that give you gas. Lock would stop by the pizza spot around the corner, purchase BAKED ZITI, and arrive with a 6-pack of PBR. He\u2019d only drink the beer he brought, and then take the rest home. This is so many layers of bad behavior. How was this man employed? How did he find someone to love him? I had unending questions. Sometimes he sheepishly ASKED PERMISSION to take the beer home, which only merits a solemn head shake in response. Don\u2019t do that. That\u2019s tacky. If you just got out of college and you\u2019re broke, you think there are exceptions to all the rules. You get trashed at the wedding but don\u2019t send a gift. Take all of grandma\u2019s Christmas checks but never write a thank you card (TEXTS DON\u2019T COUNT). Who cares if the host drinks the wine, they can dump it on a campfire for all I care. The point is, you gotta bring the thing. And leave it. Goddammit, Lock, LEAVE IT.Snack BreakI\u2019m freaking obsessed with these pimiento cheese crackers. I\u2019m making them for every social gathering from now until I croak:Pimiento Cheese CrackersThe highly addictive, melt-in-your-mouth cheddar cracker is all grown up thanks to a little heat from the cayenne and a hint of sweet pepper from the pimiento.View RecipeI hate it when people ask me to take my shoes off upon entering their home\u2014but I do it anyways. With this in mind, would it be too much to ask that my friends deposit their cell phones in a box by the door when they come over to my place? The dinner party scrolling is killing me! \u2014 Angsty AmielIt\u2019s a special moment when you realize everyone you know has bad manners except you. This also applies to the principle of driving. Savor it, Amiel! Your friends are rude, selfish, and entitled. Probably millennials. Just kidding\u2014everyone with a phone is addicted to it. Have you seen the memes? Memes are fantastic!! The only way to crawl out of this hole is together, so if you\u2019re going to be a Bossy Host, which I fully approve of, at least cushion it with something self-referential: \u201cI\u2019ve realized I\u2019m really addicted to my phone, it\u2019s keeping me from living in the moment [THIS IS A GREAT MOMENT TO TEAR UP AND/OR MENTION A PET WHO DIED], so could you join me this evening in parking your phone in this Victoria\u2019s Secret bag for the night?\u201d In your other hand is a magnum of wine, which you\u2019ll pour for your shoeless, phoneless, hapless guest. It\u2019ll cushion the blow.**Ugh, are your friends new parents? The worst. Look forward to texts with the babysitter all night, the updates read aloud along the way. She sent us a pic of Henry in the bath! He made tooty bubbles! There\u2019s no getting out of that one.My boyfriend often very kindly volunteers to do the dishes but he never cleans the sink after. Like it\u2019s full of dirty water with pieces of dinner floating in it. How do I ask him to stop this disgusting habit without seeming ungrateful for his dishwashing service? \u2014Tidy TinaAt some point, breaking up is easier than confrontation. This is that point.Is it ever okay to show up at someone\u2019s house at the exact time they put on the invite? \u2014Punctual PattyYES. CAN YOU IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE WE ALL DID THIS?!???? THIS WOULD LITERALLY ACCOMPLISH WORLD PEACE. IT\u2019LL HAPPEN AT 6 P.M.What is the least gross way to tell your host that you used the last of the toilet paper? \u2014Lastly LarryShow them what you did with it.Peden + MunkWhat are some Christmas cookies from the BA archives that I don\u2019t know about? \u2014Sugar-coated SusanRemember these pistachio sandies? An Alison Roman classic! So good. Also a sleeper hit: these peanut meringues that sound and look so French Culinary School but are actually very home-cookable. I make these chewy molasses cookies twice a December, they keep for dayssss. Pretty!! But whenever I see the photo for these curvy peppermint meringues I...feel things.That\u2019s all for now, but if you have petty etiquette questions or recipe requests for me, email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com and be too specific. I want the juicy details!Love, AlexThe painting up top is: In a Roman Osteria, 1866.
