Long Live the Dinner PartyWe\u2019ve tried the cheap impressions of Martha Stewart excellence. Are we finally ready to relax?By Alicia KennedyOctober 14, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Arsh RaziuddinFacebookTwitterEmailThis story is part of The New Rules of Dinner Parties, a new collection of advice, recipes, and perspectives on one of the things we\u2019ve missed the most. Read all the stories here.Nora Ephron, the writer and filmmaker, said that a round table works best for a dinner party. At a long rectangular table, she wrote, some guests could be left unable to take part in the conversation. M.F.K. Fisher, the grande dame of food writing, would say no more than six people should sit at that round table, and no two of them should be so in love as to bore everyone else. Martha Stewart suggests the host pick a theme rather than cobble together disparate dishes. A round table, a maximum of six guests, a theme: These are mere morsels from the wide array of advice that\u2019s been written down about how to throw good dinner parties. No wonder people fret about them.I grew up in the \u201990s assuming that when I was an adult, I\u2019d pursue the perfection of Martha. The tablecloth would match the napkins and each place setting would be just so in order to display extravagant meals. For a time I tried doing a cheap impression of that kind of excellence and I wouldn\u2019t have any fun because it wasn\u2019t real\u2014and it certainly wasn\u2019t really me. I\u2019d worry that everyone was judging my cooking or noticing a mismatched plate, and I\u2019d make too many dishes in the hopes that anything subpar could be compensated for. I\u2019ve even made whole ice cream cakes, desperate to impress.The ideal is part of a long lineage of using dinner parties to display wealth rather than to share abundance\u2014two concepts that, though easy to confuse, I\u2019ve found vastly different.Now, given time, experience, and a move from New York City to San Juan, where I\u2019ve, thankfully, had to adjust to a much more relaxed pace of life, I\u2019m more confident. My last year in the city, I worked at a wine bar with a tiny kitchen, and while I was certainly not the best short-order cook, my cooking muscles gained new dexterity from fulfilling the orders by myself that I now put to use for friends. These days, with the striving of my 20s behind me, I am content to be more Ina\u2014Garten, that is, who has said that sometimes a take-out pizza with a big homemade Caesar salad makes the most sense. I\u2019m that kind of host, giving something special on the side of something comforting. Think orange\u2013olive oil cake I whipped up myself, served with a scoop of ice cream from a pint.When I moved into my apartment in San Juan, a dark wooden rectangular table stood in the dining room. I had intended to move it out for something more my taste (lighter, rounder), but then the pandemic lockdown hit Puerto Rico. Now I\u2019ve gotten used to the table. It\u2019s hosted brunches, birthdays, and random Sunday nights around a massive pot of fettuccine in marinara, served with garlic bread and peppery arugula salad in a Balsamic dressing that reminds me of my hometown pizzeria on Long Island. The table, rectangular though it is, has done its job, and I\u2019ve dared to invite as few as one person and as many as eight over, borrowing mismatched chairs for the latter. My vintage collection of glassware also doesn\u2019t boast any full sets for white or red yet somehow I make do.All that advice about the perfect dinner party? I no longer listen to it. I had long thought of dinner parties as a space where performance and care are in opposition, but now I believe performance and care overlap. Ephron, Fisher, and Stewart, while I\u2019m sure they meant well, had set up a standard of domesticity that is easy to fail by, or at least become overwhelmed by. Their rules represent an ideal of white womanhood that obligates people to become the consummate host before pursuing any personal or professional satisfaction. The ideal is part of a long lineage of using dinner parties to display wealth rather than to share abundance\u2014two concepts that, though easy to confuse, I\u2019ve found vastly different.\u201cWhen we're thinking about dinner parties, I think a lot of it, historically, has to do with designing spaces of power and excellence,\u201d says arts journalist and dramaturg Yasmin Zacaria Mikhaiel, whom I spoke to about the dramatic power of the dinner party and why it\u2019s long been used as a narrative device. They note that dinner parties going back to ancient Greece have featured these themes and repeat a line from Aristophanes\u2019 comedy The Acharnians about a dinner party displaying riches: \u201cAnd wherever we dined, the hosts would always force us to drink out of golden goblets and crystal cups! All that sweet, unmixed wine!\u201dWhen we invite people we love into our homes, it\u2019s only natural that we want to display our best\u2014our best cooking, our best wine, our best selves\u2014but we are doing so because we want our guests to feel taken care of, to feel safe, to feel nourished. This is a fresh spin on that ancient practice of throwing a feast. \u201cWhen we\u2019re thinking about dinner parties now, it's almost like we're designing a sort of togetherness, not necessarily trying to put power and prestige on display,\u201d says Zacaria. \u201cBut we're still sort of showcasing the abundance we have for each other.\u201dThe pandemic, climate change, and the endless litany of existential and ecological crises have made me want to share what I have, whether that\u2019s baking an elaborate cake or firing off a quick flatbread to dip into hummus. We don\u2019t know what the future will bring in terms of catastrophe. The isolation of the early pandemic made me want to spend what time I have better, to share my skill at turning a red onion into a quick pickle, getting meat-eaters to enjoy jackfruit, and managing every step of an eggplant parmigiana without losing my cool (even if I do sweat). Now I have created fortifying friendships in a new city where I not long ago only had professional acquaintances. In Puerto Rico, the Spanish influence of \u201csobremesa\u201d persists; after a meal is over, we linger at the table, pour more wine, bring out interesting spirits and liqueurs to taste. We luxuriate in pure presence. Whether the flatware matches? No one notices.Abundance is what motivates hosts like Queens-based culinary educator Sammi Gay, whose elaborate and homey meals I\u2019ve been following on Instagram. She has been cooking since childhood for her friends. \u201cI remember making boxed [fudge] brownies with Oreos and chocolate syrup for sleepovers or to bring to the lunch room for friends in middle school,\u201d she says. \u201cOr making a big box of spaghetti with garlic Texas toast after school for my besties.\u201d In college in Western Massachusetts, Gay ran a permaculture garden and grew an excess of vegetables. Living off campus with a kitchen of her own, she made elaborate meals for others. \u201cHuge batches of soup, meatball subs, lots of roasted root veggies, potlucks galore\u2014it was an honor to feed my friends.\u201dThat\u2019s all I and my friends want to show off now\u2014community, pleasure, joy. \u201cI realize more and more that yes, I want my people and guests to eat good, but more important to me was their company, their pleasure, and how that fills up my home,\u201d says Gay about perfecting a meal versus simply enjoying it. \u201cThat\u2019s what I truly crave and cherish.\u201d Many of us are not interested in prescriptions or advice, but in how to make the most of what you\u2019ve got to express care, to cultivate abundance. Although I will still give the bathroom an extra scrub and light some candles too. Some etiquette stands the test of time.Explore Bon App\u00e9titDinner PartiesPartiesLifestyleCultureRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
