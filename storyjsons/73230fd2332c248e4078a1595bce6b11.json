Have a question? Email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.Can I use the same toothpick for a second sample? \u2014Snackish SamYou may not. Second samples are not a thing; this isn\u2019t Costco. When the toothpicks are out, stabbed in peach slices, you get one (of each variety, OKAY). That\u2019s the law. And when it comes to piles of snap peas and other loosies, you can try ONE to determine if they\u2019re sweet yet. Don\u2019t you dare leave the snap pea sleeping bag in that pile, though! (And, sorry! No samples for doggos.)I was taught to peel back a corn husk a few inches to check that it\u2019s not rotten. Cool, right? \u2014Corny CaseyUNCOOL. This is unnecessary and illogical and an invasion of corn privacy. Leaving a half-naked reject cob in a pile is a deterrent for future customers, not to mention the fact that you\u2019ve left the kernels exposed to air, causing them to dry out. Feel up the corn through the husk if you want a sense of how plump the kernels are, and check the wispy hair to see that it\u2019s golden and brown, not brittle and black. Then buy an extra insurance cob anyway.Illustration by Cari Vander YachtSo can I touch every tomato until I find the right one? \u2014Picky PatriceWhat are you gonna do, marry it? All tomatoes deserve our love and warm embrace. People who demand perfect produce are what got us the abomination that is the Red Delicious. Welcome ugliness into your life, and you\u2019ll discover true happiness\u2014just ask my clogs. (And if you do end up with one that has a bruise, compost that smidge or make sauce.)SNACK BREAK!Speaking of tomatoes, this tomato, prosciutto, and fig salad is a summery take on melon and prosciutto\u2014and guess what\u2019s at the farmers\u2019 market right now? TOMATOES. Stock up. Don\u2019t spend too much time looking for the emoji-replica red ones, though, deal?Tomatoes with Fig and ProsciuttoThis salad is a riff on melon and prosciutto. We swapped the melon for jammy figs and sweet tomatoes.View RecipeIllustration by Cari Vander YachtBanned from the Farmers\u2019 Market Until Further Notice:Really big dogsDouble and triple-wide strollersBluetooth phone calls while examining peachesBills over $20HagglingAsking if there\u2019s \u201cbetter looking stuff in the truck\u201dCounting change too closelyImpatienceSteven (you know who you are)Illustration by Cari Vander YachtHow do you ask whether the produce is organic without sounding like a jerk? \u2014All-Natural NoahCome on, when a farm is organic, they splatter their signage with the word as if it were...pesticide. Which they definitely don\u2019t use.Do I need to carry change? I\u2019m a millennial! \u2014Rich Ren\u00e9eYes. The world doesn\u2019t owe you a Square reader. This is why I carry a folded-up emergency $20 in my sleek Everlane credit card case. And if your total is under $5, consider buying more apples to bring back to your coworkers.Illustration by Cari Vander YachtIf you\u2019re undecided, is it all right to put the cauliflower back on display after it\u2019s been in your bag? \u2014Self-conscious SoniaYes, but place it gently back on the pile, put some other cauliflower on top, lean in, and whisper, \u201cShhhhhhh,\u201d so the other shoppers will have something to wonder about for the rest of their lives.Illustration by Cari Vander YachtCan I stick stuff in my tote before I\u2019ve paid for it so I don\u2019t have to use the plastic bags? \u2014Sustainable StewartUgh, Stewart. This is very confusing/stressful to the farmers, so why don\u2019t you acquire some eco-cool mesh PurifYou reusable produce bags ($16 for a set of 9 on amazon.com) and use those instead? After you pay, you can pile them in your stained L.L. Bean tote. That way, you can avoid your fear of apples rolling all over the place at the weigh scale without appearing to be shoplifting. You could also use the plastic bags, then reuse them next week, and the week after that, and the week after that. I twist them up into plastic pretzels for easy grab-and-go transport. Let\u2019s all try to do our best.How do I walk away from a stand without buying anything? I feel bad. \u2014Catholic Guilt CarrynLook at your phone and gasp audibly, drop the overpriced bunch of scallions you were holding, then rush away with purpose and concern.Illustration by Cari Vander YachtIs there anything that\u2019s (gulp) actually better to buy at the grocery store? \u2014Hesitant HerbertCat litter, bananas, and diet ginger ale!!!That\u2019s all for now, but if you have petty etiquette questions or recipe requests for me, email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com and be too specific. I want the juicy details!Love, AlexThe painting up top is: La marchande de fruits et legumes, 1630, (The greengrocer) by Louise Moillon.Explore Bon App\u00e9titIs It Ever OkayFarmers MarketRecipes you want to make.
