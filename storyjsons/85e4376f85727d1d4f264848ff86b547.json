Add the fish and then serve it all together. Huge difference.AnonymousChicago, IL3/4/2021This looks great and I'm making it tonight. However, there's no reason a printout of this (short) recipe should use three sheets of paper--one alone for the title. Can't BA adjust its Print options to fit this on one sheet? I hate grinding out all those empty but unusable sheets. TIA.Ellis WeinerL.A., CA1/31/2021This was a new flavor and ingredient combination for me, the reviews convinced me to try this recipe and it did not disappoint.  I followed the recipe which has great flavor combinations, easy preparation, and ingredients that I can get at my local grocery store.  It is a satisfying meal that did not leave us feeling weighed down after a holiday season of big & heavy meals.  Thanks to previous reviewers for giving me the confidence to try this new to me dish.   AnonymousOmaha, NE12/29/2020Yum! Used sole instead of cod and fennel instead of celery. The curry part is delicious!! Can\u2019t wait to make again!AnonymousNY,NY11/18/2020This was so good! I was skeptical of the celery salad not having many ingredients but it was the perfect side to the fish. And the garlic and curry went wonderfully with cod. AnonymousDenton, TX3/18/2020Delightful flavors.  No ghee in the house, used oil and butter to substitute, otherwise by the book.  This goes on the \"impress your friends and neighbors\" list.  Used frozen cod (not much fresh seafood swimming around in AZ )and served with plain white rice so as not to distract from the unique flavors.  \nWill be doing this again and not changing a thing.\nscorpianPhoenix8/25/2019This has become a GoTo recipe. I\u2019ve made it at least 3 times since seeing it, and I\u2019m making it again tonight. It\u2019s excellent fare! Cod in SoCal is typically frozen, so I use fresh Rockfish. It\u2019s firm, which this recipe requires. I also use Cilantro instead of Celery Leaves, but that\u2019s just a personal preference. I\u2019m not a curry lover, but I LOVE this with the curry et al!  And it\u2019s simple, fresh, quick, satisfying\u2014 everything a GoTo Recipe should be. Try it!  unechantuePasadena3/11/2019This was SO delicious!  I used pollack and mandolined the celery/onion.  I also doubled the garlic and curry mixture. It was easy to make and it tasted like something one would eat at a fancy restaurant. Great recipe! AnonymousNew York City 1/10/2019Excellent recipe with great flavors. I made a few substitutions, like butter for ghee and added tomatoes to the salad as well as a beans side dish, but overall this could have been perfect on its own. Will definitely make again - yum! AnonymousLos Angeles1/9/2019Delicious recipe! The red onion was way too strong for me so in the future I will use less. On the other hand, I was concerned that the mustard and curry would be overpowering, but it turned out just right! Thanks for helping me approach a new spice!lymbeverRaleigh, NC1/8/2019So delicious. Not gonna lie, the first time I made the garlic-mustard seed oil I accidentally burned it and had to start over. But it wasn't the end of the world and it was quick to redo! Cod turned out perfect, sauce was vibrant and crunchy, and I will definitely make this whole thing again. Celery, who knew?! Andy, I guess. alexbeggsBA.com 1/7/2019The variety of flavors and textures of the cod and celery salad is fantastic. mustard seeds add a pleasant crunch.
