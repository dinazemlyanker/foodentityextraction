Next up is Charlie Max, a multidisciplinary artist and model who melds nude, plant-based cooking with body positivity.In an Instagram video from March 14, 2021, Charlie Max is blending a smoothie in a tropical setting. The montage is relaxing and dreamy and the narration is rhythmic and centering. It cuts to her on a breezy balcony, slicing juicy peaches, and then eating a snack in a sunlit windowsill. The video would be nothing out of the ordinary for #foodInstagram, except that Max is doing all of this stark naked. \u201c\u2018Loving yourself\u2019 goes beyond loving your external self,\u201d she writes in the caption. \u201cIt means truly honoring yourself by constantly filling your life with conscious and beautiful things.\u201dThe post is quintessential Max; each of the divine-looking vegan dishes she shares on Instagram\u2014or, uncensored, on her OnlyFans account (NSFW)\u2014are served in the nude, alongside an easy-to-follow recipe and a healthy dose of uplifting wisdom. Max created @fude____ (food + nude, naturally) in March 2020 as a way to encourage her stressed and cooped-up followers to take care of their bodies. And also to get more folks cooking naked, an experience that\u2019s helped her heal from feelings of negative body image. Though it\u2019s developed into something even more meaningful: \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how much the food world was meant for me,\u201d Max explains. \u201cI\u2019ve become hyper aware of my purpose and mission, to create experiences that help people feel safe and confident within themselves.\u201dI called up Max on Zoom to chat about nude dinner parties, the power of plant-based cooking, and why taking care of our bodies is more important than ever.I used to be so insecure about my body\u2026 that I would wear oversize clothes to hide it. I have a dance background and negative body image is so common in that world. Dance fetishizes \u201cthin,\u201d and surrounding myself with those toxic ideas inevitably influenced my mindset. I would find myself staring at my body in the mirror every single day, analyzing myself and comparing my body to others.Nudity helped me\u2026 dive into a journey of self love. Our bodies are our true homes. And when I was able to strip down and feel safe and confident in my own skin, those feelings carried over into whatever I was doing in my everyday life. Combining that with plant-based cooking felt like the organic coming together of two pure states.I started hosting host nude dinner parties\u2026 and at first it would be a little uncomfortable for everyone involved, but then eventually they would start to open up. They would feel more comfortable because I created an atmosphere that takes the sexualization out of nudity. Finding comfort, support and acceptance in being nude around my friends allowed me to feel confident in my body.Becoming plant-based was a natural consequence\u2026 of educating myself on the food industry. About five years ago I looked further into what I was consuming. I wasn\u2019t really aware of the environmental and negative health effects of things like butter and dairy, and the more information I gathered, the more I was like, \u201cYeah, no.\u201dGrowing up and through college I didn\u2019t have a lot of money\u2026 and so it\u2019s always been my mission to take whatever I have and make something gorgeous with it. At five I would cook mashed potatoes or mac and cheese and then add colorful spices to make it cute. When I was living with my best friends in New York, even if all we had was rice and one vegetable, we\u2019d make it delicious and lovely.My favorite herb\u2026 is dill. I love it because I have positive memories of eating dill as a kid. So now when I cook, I find ways to add a little. Cooking your own meals can help you tap into your past; those meals and experiences and flavors that are specific to you can become this amazing moment you can share with people.My need for exercise and good food went out the window\u2026 after I stopped dancing and got into fashion. Then the pandemic hit and it was a big eye-opener for me to shift my habits and take care of my body because I realized I wasn\u2019t living healthily. I\u2019ve found that the benefits of plant-based food reach beyond my physical body. My mindset is stronger, my body is stronger, the environment is being preserved and it's a wonderful cycle that continues to reap benefits on every level.Giving back is so important\u2026 to me. For every recipe made and reposted by my followers I donate to No Kid Hungry because they are on a mission to make sure that every child in the U.S. has the nourishment they need, and Appetite For Change, because everything they do extends beyond the individual and has a broader social and systematic impact. When my followers cook one of the meals, they get to put nutritious foods in their bodies as well as make a contribution to someone else; it's a win-win.I\u2019d love to do a nude, vegan cooking show\u2026 in the future. Manifesting: That will happen. Otherwise, I want to keep using my account to encourage others to be more conscious of what they\u2019re eating. I really believe that will start to help people and the planet in both big and small ways.Explore Bon App\u00e9titPerson of InterestInterviewsHealthyishRecipes you want to make.
