Use full-spectrum CBD oil (we like Ritual or Isodiol) for the best effect.IngredientsTwelve 2 Tbsp. servings (15 mg CBD each) 1cup sugar\u00bdcup heavy cream3Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces1tsp. vanilla extract\u00bdtsp. kosher salt180mg CBD oilPreparationStep 1Cook sugar in a medium saucepan over medium heat, without stirring, until it begins to melt and turn golden brown around the edges. Use a heatproof spatula to stir melted sugar into unmelted sugar and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until all sugar is melted and caramel turns a deep amber color, about 5 minutes.Step 2Remove pan from heat and carefully add cream to caramel, stirring constantly (mixture will bubble vigorously and seize). Add butter and stir until melted, then stir in vanilla and salt. Let caramel cool slightly (about 5 minutes), then vigorously stir in CBD oil until mixture is emulsified. Transfer to an airtight container and let cool completely.Step 3Do Ahead: Caramel can be made 2 weeks ahead. Cover and chill. Reheat over low before using.How would you rate CBD Caramel Sauce?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkExplore Bon App\u00e9titSauceCondimentDessertCannabisHerbs & SpicesGluten-FreeNut-FreeHealthyishSimmerRecipes you want to make.
