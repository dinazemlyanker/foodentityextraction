The dressing can vary, but more often than not it\u2019s n\u01b0\u1edbc ch\u1ea5m, a garlicky fish sauce lime condiment that is essential to Vietnamese cooking. G\u1ecfi is often served as a starter or alongside a heartier dish as a palate cleanser. For as long as I can remember, there has never been a family gathering or Viet wedding without g\u1ecfi. The combination of crisp cabbage, shredded carrots, and fresh herbs tossed with tangy n\u01b0\u1edbc ch\u1ea5m and topped with crunchy peanuts makes this salad as refreshing as it is exciting. This recipe is a simplified version of one that I grew up on, but upgraded with shrimp poached in coconut milk for a subtle richness.\u201dIngredients4 servings2Tbsp. sugar2red or green Thai chiles, thinly sliced1garlic clove, finely gratedJuice of 1 lime\u00bccup fish sauce113.5-oz. can unsweetened coconut milk1tsp. kosher salt, plus more8oz. large shrimp, peeled, deveined\u00bdhead small green cabbage, shredded (about 5 cups)2medium carrots, peeled, shaved\u00bdmedium red onion, thinly sliced\u00bccup coarsely torn cilantro\u00bccup coarsely torn mint\u00bccup store-bought fried shallots\u00bccup crushed dry-roasted peanutsPreparationStep 1Combine sugar and 7 Tbsp. warm water in a small bowl and whisk until sugar is dissolved.

My boyfriend said it was the best thing I've ever made him. The nu\u00f3c cham has a surprisingly complex (and delicious) flavor for how few ingredients are in it. I followed the recipe almost to a T - though I let the shrimp sit in the coconut milk longer (the coconut flavor really came through) and added in vermicelli so it would be more filling. JamieDenver, CO9/6/2021Super delicious, definitely adding to the rotation. Didn't bother with poaching the shrimp and just sauteed them in coconut oil instead. I thought the first half of the nuoc cham was plenty for the salad and didn't use any of the reserved half, so will probably halve that part next time. Fried my own shallots, because yum. SarahBerkeley, CA5/5/2021I've made this a ton of times now and switch out the ingredients with what I have on hand, it's awesome! Great recipe. EmilyAthens, GA4/26/2021Love this!  It is great now but will really make a perfect summer dinner salad.  So refreshing!Bon Appetit fanAshland, OR4/1/2021Loved this recipe - will 100% make it again many more times. The coconut-milk-poached shrimp didn't add anything for me, so next time I'll skip it or maybe sub in grilled marinated shrimp instead.Lori3/24/2021Great and easy weeknight dinnerJrLos Angeles 3/20/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladVietnameseSoutheast AsianAsianShrimpShellfishSeafoodGreen CabbageCabbageLeafy GreensVegetableEasyQuickWeeknight MealsMainDairy-FreeGluten-FreeHealthyishSaut\u00e9DinnerRecipes you want to make.
