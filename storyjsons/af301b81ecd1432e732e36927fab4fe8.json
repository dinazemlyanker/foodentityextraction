While the chicken is the main draw, you\u2019d be woefully missing out if you didn\u2019t also order at least a half dozen past\u00e9is de nata, Romados\u2019 other specialty. The combination of flaky puff pastry and sweet, vanilla-scented custard filling baked until burnished and blackened in spots make these three-bite pastries treasures.THE VIBE IS: low-key. There are only a handful of high-top tables, plus counter seating, and very sparse decor. But the service is polite and the line manageable, with a mix of hipster locals, tourists, and Portuguese families from the neighborhood.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day: Sunday to Thursday 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., and Friday and Saturday 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. All the food is packed in to-go containers, so if weather permits, walk a few blocks over to Jeanne-Mance Park for a picnic. Don\u2019t forget the napkins.\u2014Claire SaffitzPhoto by Dominique LafondPhoto by Dominique LafondWE ALSO LOVEAu Pied de CochonGet your fill of foie gras and other Quebecois luxuries at this Plateau legendPatisserie Au Kouign-AmannA carby, sugary haven in the PlateauL\u2019ExpressWhen you want the French bistro classics, you go to this Plateau institutionExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
