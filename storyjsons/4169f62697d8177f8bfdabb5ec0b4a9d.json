To me, they all taste like home.By Ruth TerryAugust 28, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Amanda BaezaFacebookTwitterEmailTo my knowledge, no one in my family has ever written\u2014or likely ever read\u2014a recipe for habichuelas guisadas, the Puerto Rican oxblood-colored kidney beans stewed in a tomato sauce so flavorful they belie a relatively short cooking time. All of us just know how to make it.I have no recollection of learning how to prepare and portion the ingredients for the dish, though I do recall we always used canned beans. When I make it at home in Istanbul, where I moved five years ago, I start by making sofrito.Sofrito, an amalgam of aromatics and herbs that Spanish colonizers brought to the Caribbean, is what makes all Puerto Rican guisados shine. It was the foundation for all my mother\u2019s soups and my grandmother\u2019s corned beef asopao and arroz con pollo. It is also the only thing I remember making together with my mother, aunt, and grandmother, all seated around my aunt\u2019s spacious table in Levittown, New York, when I was in my late 20s.The exact formulation is not without contention, and our individual concoctions, just like our habichuelas guisadas, have been shaped by our varied locations. My grandmother\u2019s sofrito, like abuelita herself, comes from the island and uses heaps of onions, garlic, cilantro, culantro, and ajicitos dulces, habanero\u2019s unspicy doppelg\u00e4nger. Mami omits the ajicitos dulces because they were never widely available where we lived in the Chicago suburbs. She likes her sofrito \u201cdirty,\u201d with a splash of manzanilla olive juice and a jalape\u00f1o or two for a kick. When I ask Mami what Tio, her brother who lives near her in central Florida, puts in his, she shakes her head disdainfully and relays a painful family secret: \u201cHe buys it.\u201dUnlike many Puerto Ricans, I don\u2019t keep a stash of the eye-watering mixture on hand. In my Turkish-size refrigerator, which is about two-thirds the size of a typical American one, its pungency would cast a garlic glow over anything in proximity.I make my sofrito by hand because I do not own a food processor. I figure I\u2019m due for a good cry, so I start with the more acrid\u2014and, therefore, more cathartic\u2014purple onions over the white ones. With my left palm astride the blade and right hand fisted around the handle, I chop onions, a head of garlic, and two Turkish k\u0131rm\u0131z\u0131 biber, a carrot-shaped pepper with a bright sweetness. I have no memory of ajicitos dulces, but I like to imagine these local peppers taste just the same.I fall into a teary but calming trance, chopping ingredients so finely that they are nearly liquefied. This sofrito has colorful edges like a salsa, not the muddy yellowish-brown of the blended version.\u00a0Perhaps bean preparation is locked into my genetic memory, a gift from my Indigenous, African, and European ancestors.While black-eyed peas and pigeon peas arrived in the Americas via the trans-Atlantic slave trade, Phaseolus vulgaris\u2014an eclectic species of beans that includes red, black, white, and even striped kidney beans with both matte and shiny skins\u2014was first cultivated in Mexico and made its way to the Caribbean and from there into habichuelas guisadas.Rice, the eventual sidekick to these beans, was brought by Africans to the so-called New World\u2014a misnomer if there ever was one\u2014braiding the grains into their tresses. Throughout the African diaspora, rice and beans became a classic combination, eventually morphing into dishes like bruine bonen met rijst in Suriname and Brazilian feijoada.Somehow, I remember Mami\u2019s flourishes: adding a pinch of thyme, using canned-kidney-bean brine as a thickener, and mashing a few beans against the side of the pot for a toothier sauce. But living in Istanbul has changed other aspects of my guisado. Pork, traditionally used to flavor the beans, is so ubiquitous in Puerto Rican cuisine that I\u2019ve sometimes jokingly referred to it as \u201cpuercorique\u00f1a.\u201d But pork isn\u2019t available in Turkey, a Muslim-majority country. It\u2019s expensive when you find it, and there is little variety outside bacon and Italian-style deli meats. And adding Turkish beef sausage to my beans is just a step too far for me.So I\u2019ve pivoted to a completely vegan formula, deepening the sauce\u2019s character with local salc\u0131, a dark-as-blood tomato paste with a richer flavor than its American counterpart. While Mami sometimes puts cumin in her beans when she wants them to taste \u201cMexican,\u201d I like to add smoky isot biber\u2014also known as Urfa pepper in the States\u2014which sings at the same register as the salc\u0131.The pandemic in Istanbul has further altered my beans-making process. A lifetime ago in February, I knew my partner had started to take coronavirus seriously when he earnestly told me, \u201cYou know, we should really stock up on dry beans.\u201d He and a few million other people had the same thought.Prior to the pandemic, I rarely if ever soaked my beans for any dish. It took forever and they always seemed to remain toothsome. Now overnight soaking has become a way to mark the passage of time during run-together quarantine days. I credit the high mineral content of Istanbul\u2019s municipal water with breaking down the beans to their utmost creaminess.Every time I make a dish with kidney beans, whether it is Afghan lubya or Costa Rican gallo pinto, the taste ends up mimicking my childhood favorite. The exact flavor may vary, but habichuelas rojas in any incarnation always tastes familiar.But is my version, made from memory and of assorted Turkish ingredients, still even Puerto Rican? When I call Mami to discuss the matter, she brushes these questions of authenticity aside. \u201cIt\u2019s really a mindset,\u201d she says. If I believe it tastes Puerto Rican, if it creates for me that sense of comfort in this uncertain world, then that\u2019s enough.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishPuerto RicanessayRead MorecultureWhen I Couldn't Be With My Sister After Childbirth, We Practiced Zuo Yue Zi From AfarBy Charlene Wang de ChenRecipes you want to make.
