He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Cold and flu season is comingI can\u2019t tell you when the official start of \u201ccold and flu season\u201d is, but I do know that the Bon App offices got hit hard last week.Carla Lalli Music called in sick, Alex Delany and Alyse Whitney went home sick, and I staggered through a slate of endless meetings with a pounding head cold. In times like these, the BA staff turns to the recipes that soothe us.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!First up is always one of Brad Leone\u2019s tonics. Our test kitchen manager-turned-YouTube phenom keeps a battery of tinctures, juices, extracts, and herbs in the walk-in fridge. And if you butter him up good, he\u2019ll concoct a cure-all for you on short notice.Michael Graydon + Nikole HerriottI like mine with lots of fresh lemon or lime juice, some bruised mint leaves, unsweetened cranberry juice, and then whatever else Brad drops in there, from echinacea to digestive bitters. It all goes into a big plastic quart container with some ice and then, if I\u2019m feeling fancy, I top it all off with a can of seltzer. This carries me through the day when all I really want to do is take a nap on my couch.Same but different is Chris Morocco\u2019s garlic broth\u2014loads of garlic and fresh herbs simmered in water with a bit of salt and olive oil \u2018til you\u2019ve got a fragrant, fortifying broth. Fill a big mug with the stuff and you can roll up all boss-like on your colleagues, just like Lumbergh in Office Space.Of course, when you\u2019re battling a cold, you\u2019ve got to do more than stay hydrated\u2014you\u2019ve gotta eat. I gravitate toward two BA recipes, both with poached chicken, ginger and some heat, either hot sauce or fresh chiles\u2014something to clear the sinuses.I love Carla\u2019s chicken with crispy rice. She takes the chicken-poaching liquid (infused with Thai basil, ginger and scallions) and then uses it to make the rice. A brilliant, efficient move. The finished dish evokes Khao Man Gai, the celebrated signature dish at Nong\u2019s in Portland, Oregon.Alex LauIf you insist on soup when you\u2019re under the weather, then you\u2019d be wise to go with Andy Baraghani\u2019s chicken and rice soup with green chiles and ginger. It\u2019s as homey and warming as it sounds and (bonus!) it\u2019s topped with chopped roasted peanuts and scallions. I\u2019m all in.So, there you go. You\u2019re armed and ready. Because, not to get all Game of Thrones on you, but cold and flu season is coming.Get the get-well recipes:BA Brad\u2019s Classic TonicGarlic BrothChicken and Rice Soup with Green Chiles and GingerChicken with Crispy RiceExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterSoupRead MorecookingThese 3 Chicken Soups Are Here to Solve All Your ProblemsBy Alex DelanycookingAll the Things We Eat When We're Too Sick to CookBy Emma WartzmanRecipes you want to make.
