Lentils add heartiness and bite while poached eggs add an irresistible ooziness. If you\u2019re feeling ambitious, this stew is also delicious made with homemade kimchi. \u2014Diana YenAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more4large eggsPreparationStep 1Remove dark green tops from scallions and thinly slice; set aside for serving. Thinly slice remaining white and pale-green parts. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high. Cook white and pale-green parts of scallions, onion, and garlic, stirring often, until softened and starting to brown, about 4 minutes. Add gochujang and cook, stirring often and reducing heat as needed to prevent burning, until very fragrant and slightly darkened in color, about 2 minutes. Add kimchi, gochugaru, and sugar and cook, stirring, until kimchi is slightly softened and translucent, about 2 minutes. Add lentils, broth, and 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt and stir to combine. Bring stew to a boil, then reduce heat and cover. Simmer, adding a splash of water if needed to loosen, until lentils are just barely tender, 20\u201325 minutes.Step 2Uncover pan. Crack an egg into a small bowl, then gently slide into stew. Repeat with remaining eggs, leaving some space around each. Cover pan and simmer until egg whites are set but yolks are still runny, about 3 minutes.Step 3Ladle stew into bowls, making sure to include an egg in each, and top with reserved scallion tops.How would you rate Kimchi-Lentil Stew With Poached Eggs?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (8)Back to TopTriangleI liked this.  Easy, cheap, healthy, but not boring.  For me it verged on too spicy for comfort, but I'm a bit of wimp.  I used black lentils and probably because of that it did not turn out as thick as I expected (though no less delicious).  I think if I did it again with black lentils I'd use 3 cups of broth instead of 4. ErinSan Francisco, CA1/26/2022This is a good spin on Kimchi Jigae meet lentil stew. I used sesame oil, increased the garlic, and added some ginger. Plus the kimchi was super ripe and I poured in quite a bit of juice. Made the stew tangy. It\u2019s interesting on the palette: a spicy, tangy, hearty stew. Will definitely make again.  ASmithDenver12/6/2021Enjoyed this a lot! Reduced the salt (but I always do). Made it as specified and it was delicious. Do not skip the egg! It was a great addition - even for those who aren't \"egg\" people. For my pantry meal, I added a little more gochugang, some Chinese sausage I had in the fridge and served over some stirfried rice cakes. Definitely adding this to my rotation.EvanYpsilanti, MI10/18/2021Heartwarming food! I went 1.5x on the gochugaru and gochujang for some extra kickSam Adams10/6/2021Really tasty! As others have said, the salt can be reduced by half. I also added oyster mushrooms at the beginning.Elliot GUnited Kingdom10/2/2021Tasty and wholesome! And quick to prepare. Used green lentils, Sunja's medium spicy kimchi (made in VT, vegan and low sodium, very \"accessible\" for the kimchi anxiety), and half the sugar. Added some cauliflower florets, diced carrots, minced ginger. I decided to hold back on recommended salt until the end of cooking time, when I could taste the final product. Ended up not needing the extra salt! This stew is hearty, warming, flavorful, satisfying, and the egg adds lovely richness.Anonymous9/23/2021Yummy, I used up my adzuki beans and used homemade kimchi.  Delicious!Brushjlsolon, oh9/22/2021This is a great base recipe.  I'm not used to jjigae with chicken broth but it was a nice change of pace.  I'd add more kimchi and reduce the sugar by half.  Everything benefits from a poached egg!  Serve with a side of rice and it's a great pantry dinner.AmyHouston, TX9/14/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titGreen Onion ScallionOilOnionVegetableGarlicgochujangKimchigochugaruSugarLentilChicken BrothKosher SaltEggDinnerVegetarianEasyWeeknightRecipes you want to make.
