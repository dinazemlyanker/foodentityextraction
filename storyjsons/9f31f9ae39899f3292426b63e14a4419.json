If you don\u2019t have money to equitably compensate the people working to create an enjoyable dining experience, you don\u2019t have money to go out.By Jesse SparksApril 10, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Priscilla Du PreezFacebookTwitterEmailOn Monday, CNBC shared a video with a supposedly simple hack that could save people money when dining out. Interesting, right? Well, the \u201ctrick\u201d recommends calculating the tip by doubling the tax the restaurant charged (which would amount to 17.75 percent in New York City), rather than give the standard 20 percent on the total bill. While the general premise of budgeting your expenses is well-intentioned, the video misses the mark by encouraging people to save a couple dollars by skimping on what the meal\u2014and the labor that went into it\u2014is really worth. We spoke with Ashtin Berry, co-founder of equity-minded service and hospitality collective Radical XChange, and Kia Damon, chef at Lalito restaurant in New York City, to get their thoughts on how to tip like a decent human being.1. Tipping isn\u2019t optionalOne thing the video demonstrates is that, apparently, there are still a lot of people who don\u2019t understand the importance of tipping\u2014for both the individual service professional and for the team operating the restaurant. While that three percent discrepancy might save you a few dollars on every meal, this \u201chack\u201d ignores the idea that your dollar greatly impacts the people bringing and making your food. The difference is practically exponential. Think about it this way: If everyone in a 100-seat restaurant adopted this method on an $100 bill, each individual would get to walk out with $2.25 more in their pocket, but the server would have $225 less to take home.\u201cI would love to have a space where tipping isn\u2019t even a thing because we\u2019re paying people what they need to make,\u201d says Damon. But that just isn\u2019t the reality for a lot of restaurant workers. \u201cWhen I was in the kitchen, I had a set wage. If you [work in the front of house], you get tips. Your hourly wage might be lower than what you\u2019d make in the kitchen, but your tips make up for that.\u201d2. Consistency is keyThe tax you pay changes depending on where you\u2019re eating, but 20 percent knows no state bounds. If you\u2019re just relying on doubling the tax, that could mean you\u2019d be leaving as little as 10 percent in some states. That\u2019s a major loss for someone whose income is dependent on a steady stream of tips.\u201cI will always tip 20 to 30 percent because even that is still so much less than what the true cost of all of this labor is,\u201d says Berry. \u201cMost Americans go out to eat at least two to three times a week on average. If they were expected to pay the full price for the work that servers put in to run these restaurants, they couldn\u2019t afford their meals. Tipping is a way to support service workers.\u201d3. It\u2019s not about moral high groundThere\u2019s a moment in the video when interviewees jokingly suggest that the \u201ctip\u201d we should be offering to service professionals are the suggestions  to \u201cget a better job, go to school, and get an education.\u201d And while they may have been kidding (why they think that\u2019s funny, we\u2019re not exactly sure), it does highlight a common problem: People forget that service industry professionals come from a variety of backgrounds. Some actually do go to schools or invest in other training to specialize in hospitality; others choose restaurants because there\u2019s a low barrier to entry, and a real opportunity to work your way up. Whatever their reasoning is, their motivations (or what people assume their motivations are) shouldn\u2019t negatively impact the way you compensate them for their labor.\u201cFor you to decide that you have the moral high ground to look down on what other people do with their lives is a reflection of you,\u201d says Damon. \u201cTrying to shortchange servers is gross. This is their money, this is their livelihood. The whole thing is an exchange of goods and time; you\u2019re paying for a service. That\u2019s the most basic thing.\u201d4. The end of your meal isn\u2019t the time to worry about saving moneySure, we\u2019ve all experienced a bit of sticker shock when we\u2019ve received a bill, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s time to penny pinch to offset your spending. Instead, consider whether you can actually afford dinner\u2014gratuity included\u2014before entering a restaurant. If your savings goals can\u2019t accommodate that meal, that\u2019s when you consider other alternatives.\u201cTipping poorly communicates that you don\u2019t value the people who make your food,\u201d Berry says. \u201cEven before it gets to the restaurant, there are so many people involved. It\u2019s a whole ecosystem. Someone had to pick the food and butcher the meat to get to the chef. What you\u2019re saying is that you don\u2019t value those people. If that\u2019s the case, that\u2019s fine, but you should stay home.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titTippingRestaurantsEtiquettePop CultureRead MorecultureHospitality Activist Ashtin Berry Enjoys Caviar Potato Chips, Radical Self-Awareness, and a Good Twerk SessionBy Shanika HillocksRecipes you want to make.
