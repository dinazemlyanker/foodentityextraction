For me, it\u2019s only been in the last few weeks that I\u2019ve really thought about how much I miss one thing in particular: eating alone in public.This small but ever-present joy combines all the things I love most: eating, gawking at strangers, and being left alone. It\u2019s vastly different than drinking alone at bars, which men often use as an invitation to talk to me about things like my cuteness (I know, Steven) or where exactly my apartment is and whether they can come to it. I\u2019m also not big on participatory events, so I have no interest in concerts or theater or any other public functions that I could feasibly do alone, with others.All I really want is to sit with a big bowl\u2014all foods are best served in bowls, this is not up for debate\u2014and watch the world drift by. Sometimes I read, or sometimes I just enjoy watching two strangers fight at a nearby table. (Here\u2019s a helpful tip: Put in headphones so they think you\u2019re not listening to them, when, in fact, that is the only thing you are doing.)I know how lucky I am to be riding out this quarantine order with someone I love who\u2019s a great cook and spends most evenings making me inventive and comforting dishes. Hearty stir-frys, steak au poivre, pasta with tons of garlic, nicoise salad with as many eggs as I ask for\u2014my husband can make nearly anything I\u2019d request. His food is always perfect, a version of his love that I can devour, but sometimes, I don\u2019t want food to be love. I just want one little solo activity, proof of my own control, a place where I can set whatever rules I want.His food is always perfect, a version of his love that I can devour, but sometimes, I don\u2019t want food to be love.I miss eating many of these exact dishes in the quiet din of a restaurant, after the lunch rush or whenever I choose, alone, pawing at a book and pretending I\u2019ll read it, then listening to a podcast about 2 Live Crew instead.Last week, I texted Adrian, my foodiest food-food friend, who\u2019s also struggling with our quarantine orders. Adrian loves an expensive steak but will also eat an alarming amount of meat (I mean, I think it was meat?) -centric Dominos pizza if presented with it. Adrian and I once went to Miami with some friends, and on the day we left, he had six meals, including two separate dinners: an overpriced airport fish and chips platter then, about 45 minutes later, a vegan corn-and-peppers wrap on the flight. His digestive system is a puzzle and a marvel. Earlier this week, when I inexplicably bought about 50 chicken wings, my husband asked me, \u201cDid you think Adrian was coming for dinner or something?\u201dAdrian understands me. \u201cLove a walk and eat,\u201d he replied when I asked him if he also missed eating alone. \u201cDripping all over yourself. Like a sandwich on the way home.\u201d He too just wants to devour something in plain view of others, like it\u2019s evidence that we\u2019re all alive. Eating is a simple ritual, but it\u2019s one that reminds us of our own buoyancy and insistence upon living. Right now, it would be especially nice to have that kind of a reminder when everything feels so bleak.What I think about the most these days is Pho Hung, a little but formidable restaurant in Toronto\u2019s west Chinatown. I haven\u2019t lived there in a year and a half, but when I did, I\u2019d eat at Pho Hung a few times a month at minimum. For around $25 all-in (Canadian, so like, what, three American confederate dollars?), I could get a giant pho ga, fresh rolls, and a beer. When I\u2019d go alone, they\u2019d seat me by a window where I could slurp my soup, ruin the front of my shirt (instead of merely eating like an adult woman, I simply stopped wearing \u201cnice\u201d shirts there), and be ignored by all the staff. The restaurant isn\u2019t too far from a few college campuses, so there\u2019d always be a young couple sniping at each other. Dinner and a show.I left every meal at Pho Hung feeling physically full and emotionally replenished: an hour of time alone with my favorite meal, a big batch of noodles and broth, and the strict restaurant rule that you cannot take any of the soup home. I\u2019d eat it all and be so full that I\u2019d have to waddle home, right on the brink of discomfort. Later, when I would return to my husband, I felt renewed and ready for the next evening, when maybe we could have a meal together. Distance makes the heart fonder; eating alone is a reminder of how nice it can be to eat with someone.That was the magic of the solo noodle soup. Adrian calls it \u201ca brain bath.\u201d I call it rebirth.I\u2019m not sure when Adrian and I will get to return to our soups\u2014separately, of course, at Pho Hung\u2014but I have to trust that it\u2019ll happen for us eventually. One day soon, we\u2019ll be together in being alone, just how we like it. Until then, we\u2019ll have to keep finding ways to eat alone when it\u2019s impossible: him, hiding in his basement with a bowl of rigatoni, and me, gnawing on stale baguette while sitting in my dry tub, waiting for some kind of good news.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish Guide to Being AloneCoronavirusessayRead MorecultureLeading a Virtual Dance Party Is What I'm Living For Right NowBy Hilary CadiganRecipes you want to make.
