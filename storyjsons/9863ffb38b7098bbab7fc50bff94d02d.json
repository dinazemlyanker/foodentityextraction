Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,This story about tech moguls acting like stoic monks has been on my mind since I read it last week. It\u2019s about how The Real Tech Bros of Silicon Valley are starving themselves, taking cold baths, and not wearing coats in the winter. I know, I know, tech bros do the darndest things (see: \"foiling\", microdosing, bread). But I find this form of masochism to be particularly fascinating\u2014and particularly messed up. As Ruth Margolis points out, your garden-variety, six-figure-earning, Soylent-drinking tech drone may dabble in intermittent fasting, but it\u2019s the super-rich, billionaire-plus club that\u2019s adopted the hardcore forms of self-denial, like subsisting for more than a week on nothing but water, coffee, and tea. (Real question though: Are their personal chefs all out of jobs?) Margolis calls it \u201ca sort of reverse elitism,\u201d a way for stratospherically wealthy people to show off their supposed normalcy. But, uh, when was the last time you fasted on days that started with the letter \u201cS,\u201d like Twitter founder Jack Dorsey? I think these punishing habits are less about being just like us and more about expunging massive guilt via bizarre forms of self-flagellation. Whether they realize it or not, these men (yes, they're all men) feel guilty about how they got their money and at whose expense.But also...it\u2019s an eating disorder! As a society, we\u2019ve gotten better at calling bullshit on diet culture. Women\u2019s magazines are no longer solely dedicated to weight-loss tips (and how to please your man). The media has gotten more careful about not glorifying rail-thin celebrities. Even Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s wildly successful wellness empire has gotten plenty of flack for being a diet company in disguise.\nBut when boy billionaires start proselytizing about week-long fasts and punishing exercise routines, it\u2019s not a diet or a disorder; it\u2019s a biohack. It's the new frontier of science! As Monica Hesse sums it up in the Washington Post: \u201cIt\u2019s both remarkable and depressing to watch Jack Dorsey blithely describe a diet that would put any woman\u2014or any non-wealthy man\u2014into the penalty box of public opinion.\u201dKinda reminds you of when male politicians talk about parenthood, amirite?Anyway, if the billionaires leading us into the techno-future tried to be more like people\u2014living, eating, eventually dying\u2014instead of robot gods, I think we\u2019d all be in a better place.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish EditorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletteressayRead MoreLifestyleLunch is the New DinnerBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
