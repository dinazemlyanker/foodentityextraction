Dough for the gyoza and wontons is made twice a day; it\u2019s so delicate that they have to adjust the amount of flour depending on the temperature and humidity. For appetizers, ask for pan-fried gyoza as well as the velvety soft-boiled variety; they\u2019re both amazing. After that arrives, order ramen\u2014either the shina soba broth or the spicy, sesame-based tantanmen. What this hole-in-the-wall lacks in atmosphere, it makes up for in quality and execution.\u201d\u2014Naomi Pomeroy of Expatriate and Beast, both in Portland, OregonPhoto by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneKaduya's shoyu ramen.\nExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
