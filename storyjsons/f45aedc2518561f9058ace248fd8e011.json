But this cranberry relish isn\u2019t meant only for the Thanksgiving table: Try it as part of a festive breakfast on pancakes or French toast, as a holiday cheeseboard condiment, or as a sweet spread on grilled cheese sandwiches (it\u2019s great with brie!).All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Maybe I overcooked it a little?  It was still very delicious and every bit of it was eaten.Lazlo HollyfeldByram, NJ11/29/2021Just made this in preparation  for a family meal. Absolutely delicious! The ingredients are simple and delicious and the raisins are to die for as they had not only a bitter sweet element but also some nice texture. It is quite jammy and has a nice flavor to it.
