The shaved cucumber and melon will release some liquid and lose a bit of crunch after they\u2019re dressed, so toss everything together just before serving. \u200aIf you\u2019re truly averse to turning on your oven right now, buy roasted pistachios.Ingredients4 servings \u00bccup raw pistachios\u00bdjalape\u00f1o or Fresno chile, thinly sliced2Tbsp. white wine vinegar1tsp. honey3Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oilKosher salt, freshly ground pepper1English hothouse cucumber, halved crosswise, then halved lengthwise, seeds scooped out with a spoon\u00bcmedium ripe honeydew melon or cantaloupe, rind removed5oz. ricotta salata (salted dry ricotta) or feta\u00bdcup basil leavesPreparationStep 1Preheat oven to 350\u00b0.

Made with Greek Mizithra cheese in place of ricotta salata. AnonymousIthaca, New York8/20/2019This is a fabulous recipe that really defines summer, but is still great in September.  I have modified the recipe by adding in some avocado and then any number of fish proteins:  grilled swordfish, seared scallops, Chilled grilled swordfish leftovers and even cooked shrimp.  This is just such a versatile recipe!  Thanks so much for putting it in the mag!
