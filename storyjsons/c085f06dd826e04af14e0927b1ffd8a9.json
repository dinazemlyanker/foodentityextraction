You\u2019ll find recipes she\u2019s cooking, stories she\u2019s loving, where she\u2019s been eating, and more. It gets better: If you\u00a0sign up for our newsletter, you\u2019ll get this letter before everyone else.The August issue of Bon App\u00e9tit is out now (subscribe for future issues here!), and it\u2019s clear that grilling is the theme of the month. But we just as easily could\u2019ve called it the Inspiration Issue. Here at BA, we\u2019re inspired to travel again, so we turned to food people (chefs, shop owners, and cookbook authors) for advice on planning food-focused getaways. Where, we asked them, do they take guests to eat and sightsee when showing off their respective hometowns? I don\u2019t know about you, but after an intense 2020, I want to keep my weekend bag packed so I can explore every destination in this package, whether it\u2019s just a short flight away like New Orleans and Charleston or 12 hours ahead, like Singapore with its UNESCO-protected hawker culture. (Okay, I\u2019d need more than a weekend bag for that trip.)I\u2019m also energized by Kaleo Kanahele Maclay, the Paralympic volleyball player who heads to Flower & Flour, the bakery she owns with her husband in Oklahoma City, at four in the morning to make blueberry scones before she trains at eight. Can you imagine how accomplished she must feel by noon? If I get through the New York Times Spelling Bee puzzle by 10 a.m., I feel like a superhero.There\u2019s inspiration to be found in our recipes too. I love our stories on grilled chicken with specific recipes and techniques best suited for every part of the bird, all developed by the BA Test Kitchen. The spatchcocked chicken has a preparation so simple\u2014mostly salt and five-spice powder\u2014I was sure I\u2019d missed a step, but it couldn\u2019t have been more delicious. And the vegetarians in the office wouldn\u2019t stand for another sorry story on a grilled portobello burger, so we developed recipes where the veggies aren\u2019t afterthoughts but the stars. For more on grilling, from how to choose charcoal to nearly 100 archival recipes, check out bonappetit.com/grilling.But let\u2019s be honest: In summer we\u2019re most excited about dessert, and this month we featured Samantha Seneviratne, whose recipes highlight all sorts of berries. The blueberry and peach galette, as tasty as it is pretty, has graham crackers in the crust, which lend it a lightly chewy quality. Plus, it\u2019s a perfect use for all those graham crackers hanging around after the kids make s\u2019mores.
