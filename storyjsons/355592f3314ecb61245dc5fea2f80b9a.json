Here\u2019s How Four Baltimoreans Make It WorkAt Socle in Baltimore, you can start your morning with a latte at Sophomore, chow down on bean-heavy grain bowls for lunch at Larder, then head to the gorgeous bilevel Fadensonnen for a frosty glass of beer, natural wine, or fireside sake. Just don\u2019t call it a food hall.By Allison RobicelliOctober 18, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Kate GrewalFacebookTwitterEmailOver the past decade, Lane Harlan and her partner, Matthew Pierce, have redefined what it means to have a proper drink in Baltimore, first through their intimate cocktail bar W.C. Harlan, then with their mezcaleria Clavel. Lying dormant in their minds the entire time was the idea for a modern, open-air biergarten. But as Harlan points out: \u201cSpaces dictate what you do with them.\u201d So last year, when the ideal locale\u2014a former residence and carriage house, built in the 1850s and separated by a vacant lot\u2014finally came up for sale, the couple realized this project would be more than just theirs alone. They gathered some friends and created a dining collective, with five distinct spaces and an artist residency, called Socle, which means a platform for displaying art.A subterranean corner lot became Sophomore Coffee, from former Clavel manager Kris Fulton and his partner, Ann Fortune. A small retail space with an open kitchen became Larder, a thoughtful lunch concept from artist-turned-chef Helena del Pesco. Across the communal patio sits Harlan and Pierce\u2019s baby, Fadensonnen: downstairs, a casual beer parlor; upstairs, a cozy natural wine and sake bar. \u201cSomeone could go to Sophomore on a Saturday morning to drink coffee and check their email,\u201d says Harlan. \u201cThey could walk to Larder, order lunch, and sit with a friend in the courtyard. Then they could ease into evening with a glass of wine from Fadensonnen. We\u2019re individual concepts coexisting, but we\u2019re also a cultural community of our own.\u201d Here\u2019s how it all comes together.Owner Kris Fulton mans the counter at Sophomore Coffee.\nPhoto by Kate GrewalAn employee gathers herbs from the shared rooftop garden.\nPhoto by Kate GrewalDel Pesco is in charge of food for the entire complex, collaborating with Harlan and Fulton on menu ideas before selling finished products back to them wholesale. Her days start at 6 a.m., when she starts baking Sophomore\u2019s signature salted chocolate chip cookies and seasonal pastries. From 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., she churns out grain bowls, soups, and killer grilled cheeses at Larder. When Fadensonnen opens at 5 p.m., she starts sending over small bites to be plated by the wine bar staff: marmalades, lacto-fermented vegetables, and p\u00e2t\u00e9 made from local mushrooms, whose earthy flavors come together with a splash of rancio sec from the bar\u2019s rotating wine list.Socle grows \u201cmore herbs than we know what to do with,\u201d according to Harlan, in a shared rooftop garden. Fertilized by food scraps from all three businesses, the herbs are used for Larder\u2019s dishes and the teas served at Sophomore and Fadensonnen. The rest of the scraps and used compostable containers are collected weekly by Washington D.C.\u2019s Compost Cab, which donates them to local farming nonprofits.Fadensonnen's downstairs taproom features an array of local beers.\nPhoto by Kate GrewalLunch is served at minimalist all-day cafe, Larder.\nPhoto by Kate GrewalAll the owners are committed to smart sourcing, and buying collectively lets them support smaller producers, like family-run South Mountain Creamery, which still runs a door-to-door milkman service. Much of Socle\u2019s produce comes from Chesapeake Farm to Table, a network that\u2019s helped transform some of Baltimore\u2019s vacant lots into urban farms. Many\u2014such as Larder favorite Strength to Love\u2014are located in food deserts, and also provide job training and agricultural education.\u201cWe share basic materials like ice in the summertime when people are drinking tons of iced coffee at Sophomore, shrubs at Larder, and spritzes at Fadensonnen,\u201d says Harlan. \u201cWe got on an \u2018ice pickup\u2019 schedule so that our single machine has enough hours in between to recuperate!\u201dLocals gather for sake and natural wine at Fadensonnen's airy upstairs bar.\nPhoto by Kate GrewalThe team regularly collaborates on fundraisers\u2014like Gut High, a wild fermentation festival spearheaded by Lane Harlan and the Fadensonnen team\u2014to raise money for the Old Goucher neighborhood where they\u2019re located: planting native flora like pussytoes and Christmas ferns, adding brighter street lighting, and installing sidewalk bike racks for public use.To supplement the small plates on Wednesday through Sunday nights, Harlan rents out a community food truck parked outside the beer garden. She subsidizes half the rental cost to promote experimentation and diversity. Frequent guest chefs include the Mera Kitchen Collective, a worker-owned female refugee cooperative, and Harlan\u2019s mother Lola Yuzon-Harlan, a Filipino \u00e9migr\u00e9 who serves Pampanguenan comfort foods like arroz caldo, sinigang, and adobo.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsBaltimoreRecipes you want to make.
