But for your loved ones who really deserve something nice this year\u2014whether that\u2019s your health care worker auntie who will never spend money on herself or your Quarantine Boo who at this point is just your Actual Boo\u2014we\u2019ve got you covered too. Read on for statement bar carts, sacks of oysters, and a play kitchen for the trendsetting toddler who is impossible to shop for.For your friend who is sad that CSA season is overJosephine Heilpern, the ceramist behind BA editor fave Recreation Center, turned us on to Piera Bochner\u2019s candles\u2014one part produce and one part NSFW. Bochner learned the art of mold making while training as a sculptor in Berlin, and after casting a candle mold from a greenmarket romanesco, she knew she had found her muse. Now she scours the produce aisle for textural fruits and vegetables, like bitter melon, sugar apple, and bumpy decorative gourds, to make these whimsical candles that will delight any farmers market regular. The only thing Heilpern laments: \u201cI can\u2019t bring myself to burn these\u2014they\u2019re too beautiful.\u201dPhoto by Laura MurrayPiera Bochner Bitter Melon Candle$69 at Piera BochnerPhoto by Laura MurrayPiera Bochner Romanesco Candle$69 at Piera Bochner$65 at GarmentoryFor the Kondo convertHandcrafted by master artisans in northern Ghana, these Pakurigo wave baskets are woven from durable vetiver grass. Their undulating, organic forms\u2014each basket is unique\u2014remind us of mollusk shells, or maybe pattypan squash run amok. The compulsive organizer in your life will find the 12-inch basket the perfect size for stashing away winter scarves (only the ones that bring her joy!) or showcasing a clementine haul.Baba Tree Tiny Pakurigo Wave Basket$85 at Goodee World$85 at Baba TreeFor the designer-jeans fiendUlrich \u201cUbi\u201d Simpson designed for brands like Tommy Hilfiger and Pepe Jeans for 25 years, but he hadn\u2019t spent much time in the kitchen until the birth of his daughter. It was then that he saw a need for durable, protective aprons, oven mitts, and pot holders, and Mi Cocina was born. His pieces are crafted from hard-wearing denim that gets better with age. The classic apron comes in four different washes with cross-back adjustable straps and all the pockets your Re/Done-loving brother could need.Mi Cocina Denim Apron$99 at Mi Cocina$99 at GarmentoryFor the minimalistCeramist Lalese Stamps was feeling stuck. \u201cI was making the same pieces over and over\u2014pieces that people really wanted to buy\u2014but I wasn\u2019t challenging myself,\u201d she recalls. To break out of her rut, Stamps set a goal of making a different mug every day for 100 days. She chose sleek black clay for the project and fashioned a different handle for each. One resembles the rings of Saturn, another a tiny steering wheel, and a third sports spikes worthy of Bowser Koopa. Fun yet modern, they\u2019re like the little black dress of coffee mugs.Lolly Lolly 100 Day Project Mug$52 at Lolly Lolly CeramicsFor your compost-loving sister with no outdoor spaceYour sister ended her worm bin composting experiment when they escaped from under the kitchen sink, and now that she\u2019s saving her food scraps to drop off at the local greenmarket, she doesn\u2019t have any room for her Quorn patties in her freezer. The Vitamix FoodCycler offers another solution. This countertop appliance, which is about the size of a breadmaker, dehydrates and grinds food scraps down into nutrient-rich dust. Combined with potting soil, it\u2019ll keep your sister\u2019s houseplants happy and healthy.Vitamix FoodCycler FC-50$400 at Vitamix$400 $280 at AmazonFor the host whose party is canceled this yearWe all have that friend who throws the holiday party of the season, the one with a giant bowl of punch and a cheese ball the size of a baby\u2019s head. Chances are he\u2019s spending this year on the couch, watching a slideshow of holiday parties past. (Cue \u201cThe Way We Were.\u201d) Cheer up the off-duty host with a sack of Sweetwaters from Hog Island Oyster Co., an oyster farm north of San Francisco that is selling directly to consumers as a way to make up for decreased demand from restaurants. He can slurp his fill without worrying about guests spilling cocktail sauce on the rug.Extra Small Hog Island Sweetwater Oysters$75 at Hog Island Oyster Co.For your older sister who\u2019s all about form and functionIs it a necklace or a trivet? Crafted from solid brass, this set of trivets comes in three different sizes to accommodate your tiniest pot and largest casserole dish. The organic lines call to mind puddles of water, clouds, or various types of potatoes, but whatever your Rorschach test results, your discerning sis will think they\u2019re beautiful enough to leave on any table 24/7.Ferm Living Pond Brass Trivets$69 at END.For the midcentury-modern aficionadoPastry chef Ayako Kurokawa, owner of the tiny Brooklyn bakery Burrow, swears by this set of stainless-steel bowls from Japanese midcentury industrial designer Sori Yanagi. \u201cThey\u2019re both beautiful and practical\u2014stackable and easy to hold,\u201d Kurokawa explains. Yanagi, whose furniture appears in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the Louvre, was guided by the philosophy, \u201cTrue design lies in a realm counter to trends.\u201d These simple, durable bowls are the antithesis of trendy, and for Kurokawa, no others will do; she brought her own personal set to Burrow as soon as she signed the lease.Sori Yanagi Stainless-Steel Bowls$217 at JinenFor your auntie who keeps the Kikkoman dispenser with the red spout on her counterMade by Tokyo\u2019s oldest glassmaker, Hirota Glass, this delicate soy sauce cruet has milky opalescent stripes and holds five ounces of liquid. Help your auntie level up her kitchen countertop by encouraging her to keep it on a tray by the stove, next to the oil and the salt that is definitely still in its carton. You can get her a nice salt cellar next year.Whitney OttSoy Sauce Cruet$52 at East ForkFor the green pink thumbWe\u2019ve already proclaimed this the Year to Grow Indoor Citrus, and we\u2019re doubling down with this variegated pink lemon tree. With painterly green stripes on the rind and blush pink flesh inside, pink lemons are a serious contender for Most Beautiful Citrus (we love you anyway, ugli fruit). If you\u2019re giving this to someone who doesn\u2019t live in a warm, sunny climate, the tree can still thrive indoors with the right amount of sunlight and humidity.Variegated Pink Lemon Tree$68 at TerrainFor your mother-in-law who loves a statement pieceWe love marble\u2014who doesn\u2019t love marble?\u2014but we don\u2019t always love the price. A great alternative is onyx, a type of quartz that, according to the ancient Greeks, formed from the fingernail clippings of the goddess Venus. We\u2019ll take a hard pass on that origin story, but this gorgeous centerpiece, hand-carved by artisans in Pakistan using stone mined in Peshawar and Quetta, will please even the hardest-to-please in-law.Photo by Laura MurrayThe Artisan Variety Onyx Stone Bowl$105 $84 at EtsyFor the ambitious toddlerFrankly, this kitchen makes us feel attacked. The subway tile. The brass hardware. The Pantone Color of the Year cabinets. We want this for our kitchen. Are we being actively mocked, mocked by children who are still in diapers? This play kitchen comes with a lidded pot, saucepan, spatula, cutting board, and wireless telephone, so your kid can order takeout on the nights they don\u2019t feel like cooking.Teamson Kids Little Chef Berlin Modern Play Kitchen$199 $173 at Walmart$181 at MaisonetteFor your nephew who just moved into a 300-square-foot studio apartmentBA editor Elyse Inamine uses this mod rolling shelf as a bar cart, but we think it would make a great addition to your nephew\u2019s 300-square-foot apartment with no closets. It\u2019s endlessly adaptable. He can use it in the kitchen to store boxed macaroni and protein powder, as a nightstand by his bed, or in the bathroom for grooming products and toilet paper. (Who are we kidding, he never has toilet paper.) Even if he doesn\u2019t know how chic this cart is, he\u2019ll thank you.CB2 Peekaboo Acrylic Rolling Two Shelf Cart$349 at CB2For the golden child of the familyIt\u2019s no secret that we here at BA believe a set of fine-mesh strainers is an indispensable addition to any kitchen. But presenting your little sister with practical $12 cooking utensils doesn\u2019t exactly scream \u201cfestive!\u201d The holidays call for excess and frippery and GOLD, so get her these gilded ones instead. She can use the large one to drain lentils, the medium one to separate out the seeds from raspberry pur\u00e9e, and the tiny one to sift powdered sugar over a flourless chocolate cake. And when they\u2019re not in use, they\u2019re beautiful enough for your sister to keep on display rather than tucked inside a drawer with the vegetable peeler you got her last year.Photo by Laura MurrayGold Stainless-Steel Strainers$58 at TerrainFor you, because you deserve something niceThere\u2019s no other way to put it: This is a $100 Champagne coupe. Is it extravagant? Yes. Frivolous? Perhaps. But you\u2019re probably not throwing a raucous holiday bash this year, so you have no need for a set of 20 Champagne glasses. Maybe your \u201cNew Year\u2019s Eve party\u201d is you, a bath, a bag of Takis, and a single perfect Champagne coupe. It\u2019s been a rough year. Get yourself something nice.Calici Milanesi Champagne Coupe$100 at The WebsterExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingGift GuidesHoliday 2020Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
