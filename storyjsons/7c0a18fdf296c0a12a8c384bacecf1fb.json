This Puerto Rican version uses many of the same ingredients from our pernil, with the addition of smoked ham hock. If you have more time, keep the ham hock simmering for another hour or longer for even more flavor and super-tender meat. We call for canned gandules because they\u2019re easier to find, but if you can find frozen, use those; they will have better flavor and texture. Simply let them thaw before proceeding.Ingredients6\u20138 servingsSofrito2ripe plum tomatoes, cored, coarsely chopped (about 1\u00bd cups)1medium onion, coarsely chopped (about 1 cup)2Cubanelle peppers, seeds removed, coarsely chopped (about 1 cup), or 1 medium green bell pepper, ribs and seeds removed, coarsely chopped1medium red bell pepper, ribs and seeds removed, coarsely chopped (about 1 cup)1large bunch cilantro, coarsely chopped (about 1 cup)1head of garlic, cloves separated, peeledRice and Assembly1smoked ham hock3cups homemade chicken stock or low-sodium chicken broth\u00bccup extra-virgin olive oil21.4-oz. packets Saz\u00f3n con Culantro y Achiote (such as Goya)4tsp.

Now I have to get creative with all the leftover sofrito.AnonymousChicago, IL11/17/2020I'm going to completely agree with the previous comment. What makes a dish truly Puerto Rican are the inclusion of culantro (typically known as \"recao\" amongst Puerto Ricans or \"Chinese coriander\" in Asian markets) and aj\u00ed dulce, the small sweet chili peppers. The steaming of the rice with the banana leaf adds great depth. Anatto seeds are steeped in lard or oil for color and flavor, saz\u00f3n packets in this application are lazy. Also, these types of rice dishes in Puerto Rico always utilize short or medium-grain rice, never long grain. Puerto Rican recipes are hardly ever written about on these platforms, so it's important that it's represented accurately. AnonymousSanturce, Puerto Rico4/26/2020As with the recipe for pernil, the sofrito is missing two key ingredients. Add 6 - 7 sweet chili peppers (capsicum chinense), seeded and finely chopped and 3- 4 culantro leaves (eryngium foetidum), coarsely chopped.  These two DO make a big difference.\nAlso, if you have access to a bodega or any other Latin American market, try to get a plantain leaf to place over the rice before covering the saucepan.  This will add a nice layer of flavor.\nAlex IthierPonce, Puerto Rico12/15/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titPuerto RicanCaribbeanRiceRice & GrainsPigeon PeaBeanVegetableSideDairy-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreeDinnerRecipes you want to make.
