(You mean you don\u2019t all have six kilos of Guittard chocolate in your closet?) That\u2019s why when Basically Editor Sarah Jampel told me that the average home baker doesn\u2019t laminate their pie dough, I was very confused. \u201cWhat do you mean? Like, how else do you even do it?!\u201dIf you\u2019ve only ever made pie dough by \u201cmixing it up and rolling it out\u201d (that\u2019s how Sarah tells me most people do it), you probably don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re missing. Your past pie doughs may have been tender, sure, but my recipe, which relies on the process of \u201clamination\u201d (i.e. the process of rolling and folding) puffs in the oven and shatters under your fork\u2014it\u2019s crispy, light, and full of air. It's the pie dough equivalent of a great croissant (a pastry that, not coincidentally, also relies on the laminating technique).Don\u2019t try this with any old pie dough recipe: This one has more butter than the average, which means the crust will come out tender even after all of the rolling and folding. And, whereas most recipes instruct you to break down the butter into pea-sized pieces, for this one you\u2019ll quickly smash each cube once. In the laminating process, those big butter chunks will get flattened out into long sheets. Add the ice water, smash it into the dough aggressively, and then you\u2019re ready to laminate\u2014and it\u2019s really not that intimidating:Okay, so you\u2019ve got your shaggy mass\u2014that combination of cold butter that you\u2019ve smashed into pieces, plus flour and water. Now dump it onto your work surface and gather it into a rough square. It will be messy. You\u2019ll have dry bits, big pieces of butter, and even some wet clumps of dough, but that\u2019s okay.Now\u2019s the time to get rolling. Use as much flour to dust the counter, dough, and rolling pin as you feel you need. You can always brush the excess flour off with a dry pastry brush when you\u2019re done. Roll the dough out until it\u2019s about \u00bd-inch thick. You should aim for a square or rectangle, but don\u2019t get hung up on shape: What is most important is thickness. Your goal is to get the butter into thin, flat sheets that will be layered throughout the dough.Next, fold the dough\u2014which will still be piece-y and broken-looking\u2014over onto itself, using the bench scraper to assist. Then fold it over onto itself again. We\u2019ve made four layers already!Now, repeat the process one more time by rolling the dough out to about \u00bd-inch thickness and then folding it over itself twice. The dough will hold together at this point, with those big pieces of butter looking more like streaky sheets.After this last round of folding, those four layers have transformed into 16! That\u2019s 16 layers that will puff in the oven as the butter melts and creates steam. That's it: You\u2019ve just laminated dough. You\u2019ve made a pie crust flakier and lighter than any you\u2019ve tasted before, and I can guarantee you won\u2019t go back to your mix-and-roll ways of the past. You\u2019re practically a pastry chef! Now there\u2019s only the matter of finding some closet space for your chocolate.Get the recipe:Triple-Threat Onion GaletteNot just a clever name, this savory tart combines three alliums (scallions, garlic, and onion) for maximum flavor and crispy-jammy texture. The key to the flaky crust is to move fast! Rolling and folding the dough while the butter is still cold creates distinct layers of butter and flour that will steam apart during baking, making the crust light and flaky.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBakeBasically BakingRecipes you want to make.
