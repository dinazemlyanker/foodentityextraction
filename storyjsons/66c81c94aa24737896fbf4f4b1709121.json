Leftover rice is transformed into an umami-laden fried rice topped with a crispy fried egg and a side of crunchy kerupuk (savory prawn crackers that stimulate the appetite). Named as one of Indonesia\u2019s national dishes and described by some as the world\u2019s greatest comfort food, nasi goreng is often seasoned with a combination of light soy, the fermented sweet soy sauce kecap manis, chiles, turmeric, and white pepper. Lee\u2019s version is a feast of texture and flavor, adding the fresh citrusy zing of the lemongrass and makrut lime to the sambal matah, a beloved condiment eaten all over the island of Bali. (If you want to make it vegan, simply omit the fried egg.)\u00a0Ingredients2\u20134 servingsSambal Matah4small shallots, thinly slicedKosher saltZest and juice of 1 makrut (Thai) lime or 1 regular lime2makrut (Thai) lime leaves, thinly sliced, or zest and juice of 1 regular lime2lemongrass stalks, bottom third only, tough outer layers removed, thinly sliced2long red chiles (such as Holland or Fresno), finely chopped, seeds removed if you prefer less heat11\u00bd\" piece ginger, peeled, cut into matchsticks1garlic clove, thinly slicedPalm sugar or brown sugarSunflower oil or other neutral oil (for drizzling)Nasi Goreng3Tbsp. virgin coconut oil or sunflower oil, divided\u00bdleek, white and pale green parts only, thinly sliced2small shallots, thinly sliced1long red chile (such as Holland or Fresno), thinly sliced, seeds removed if you prefer less heat\u00bctsp. ground turmeric1bok choy, coarsely chopped3cups cooled cooked jasmine or basmati rice2Tbsp. kecap manis (sweet soy sauce)4tsp. light soy sauce1tsp. tomato pur\u00e9e\u00bdtsp. unseasoned rice vinegar or white wine vinegarKosher salt, freshly ground white pepper2large eggsHomemade or store-bought fried shallots (for serving)1scallion, thinly sliced on a diagonalKerupuk or prawn crackers (optional)PreparationSambal MatahStep 1Place shallots in a small bowl and sprinkle with a generous pinch of salt.

Loved the inclusion of more veg. 1000% tasty AF. Haven't eaten this for 10+ years. Truly enjoyed this recipe!!!!Alodie WestenbroekCanada10/13/2021I'm irrationally upset at the inclusion of one teaspoon of tomato pur\u00e9e. What the heck am I supposed to do w the rest of the can?? I'm not buying it just for a teaspoon of tomatoAnonymousUlm, Germany8/30/2021Is the rice already cooked before adding to the recipe?Jeff7/13/2021This was... weirdly sweet? It might be my fault - I couldn't find kecap manis so I made my own based on a recipe I found (soy sauce + brown sugar). That plus the sugar in the sambal matah just made for a sticky, almost candy-like concoction that is not the nasi goreng I am used to. The chiles were basically raw and VERY spicy. If I made it again, I would cut way down on the sugar and chiles. All in all, not really for me. My husband said he liked it though, so I guess it's a wash? AnonymousLos Angeles1/26/2021Way too hot for us! Flavors were good, but not a keeper for me. I don't like my mouth and lips to feel scorched!AnonymousPhiladelphia, PA1/11/2021It's perfect. It's so delicious. I used carrot and spinach instead of bok choyAnonymousIndonesia11/8/2020What a great weeknight treat, can't wait to try!AnonymousBrooklyn, NY 10/16/2020HlpAnonymous10/16/2020This recipe is so simple and wonderful! I didn't have lemongrass or scallions and subbed lime for the lime leaves and red onion for shallots (blasphemous, I know, but trying times here) and made it anyway! It was delicious, quick, and flavorful.
