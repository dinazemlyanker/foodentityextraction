This kind of quesadilla is called a costra de queso, and it\u2019s now the only way I want to eat quesadillas (and I\u2019m from Texas!). You can find it at Vaquero Taquero, a popular food truck turned brick and mortar spot in Austin.Owners (and brothers) Daniel and Miguel Cobos borrowed the technique from taquerias in Monterrey, Mexico\u2014the two grew up in the Rio Grande Valley, right along the border. Their quesadillas give you both a hard and soft shell taco in one. You can choose from a variety of meaty fillings, from al pastor to steak (please appreciate the cartoonish animal heads that illustrate these options on the menu), but the pro move is to get the nopales. The nubs of cactus are saut\u00e9ed with smoky salsa macha on the griddle to give them heat and crunch and depth without any of that gooeyness often associated with the vegetable. Then the nopales-salsa mixture is punched up with some sweet corn before going into the quesadilla.No matter which filling you go for, get your order \u201ccon todo,\u201d with a tangy, Frank\u2019s Red Hot-esque salsa roja; avocado crema; cilantro; onions; and\u2014because why not?\u2014even more cheese.Go there: Vaquero TaqueroExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsAustinRead MorerestaurantsMy Favorite Tacos in Mexico City Come Out of a Meat JacuzziBy Rachel KartenRecipes you want to make.
