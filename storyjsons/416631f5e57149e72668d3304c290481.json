Up next, scholar of critical race, feminist, and disability studies Dr. Moya Bailey.Dr. Moya Bailey believes that good things come from connecting and organizing. After seeing how Black women were stereotyped and miscategorized in medical yearbooks while working on her graduate school dissertation in 2010, Bailey coined the term \u201cmisogynoir\u201d (a portmanteau of \u201cmisogyny\u201d and the French word for \u201cblack\u201d) to describe how Black women are viewed and treated in society vis-\u00e0-vis their race and their gender. \u201cIt was about creating clarity. Once you\u2019re able to name your oppression, I think you\u2019re better able to address it,\u201d she says.Through the work of Bailey and the artist and critic Trudy, creator of the now-defunct blog Gradient Lair, \u201cmisogynoir\u201d entered the popular lexicon and has since been used to unpack everything from Beyonce\u2019s Lemonade album to racist beauty ideals. \u201cI think it\u2019s been useful to other people in the sense that they see Black women are treated very differently from white women, and even from other women of color.\u201d What\u2019s unfortunate, she adds, is that people need to use the designation so often.Bailey curates the digital presence for the Octavia E. Butler Legacy Network, an organization that supports and promotes the writer\u2019s legacy, and she is a professor at Northeastern University, where she teaches Introduction to Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. She also has two books in the works, one on \u201chashtag activism,\u201d which she\u2019s co-writing, and a solo venture called Transforming Misogynoir: Black Women's Digital Resistance in U.S. Culture due out in 2021. We caught up with the scholar of critical race, feminist, and disability studies about the things that satisfy her spirit and taste buds, the meaning of community, and the timeless bops filling her playlist.The best thing I did this year was... start swimming lessons with a friend of mine. Learning how to swim has been an important task. With the history behind many Black people not knowing how to swim, that was really important for me.My love language is\u2026 \u201990s R&B. I\u2019m fully embracing my inner Black auntie.I feel grounded when\u2026 I\u2019m cooking for people I love.The last thing I read, watched, or listened to that made me feel seen was\u2026 I just finished Unapologetic by Charlene Carruthers. The last chapter on the mandate for a movement was really powerful to me.My village includes... a group of folks we lovingly call The House of Mati, building on Gloria Wekker\u2019s use of the term mati work, [\u201can old practice among Afro-Surinamese working-class women in which marriage is rejected in favor of male and female sexual partners\u201d]. We build these relationships between women who have romantic, platonic, and non-platonic connections. I would also say my partner, our good friends, and the community that I\u2019ve built in Boston.Real activism is\u2026 intentional and collective. Being an activist in isolation does not do the work of creating the kinds of changes we need for a different world. It requires organizing and relationship building.My favorite thing to eat when I\u2019m celebrating is\u2026 Pasta. Pasta in any form is my favorite thing. With any tomato-based sauce like arrabbiata, because it\u2019s spicy.Two dishes from African American cuisine I\u2019d bring on a deserted island\u2026 My mac and cheese is legendary. It is quite excellent. Mac and cheese for sure. And probably fried catfish.When I feel blue I like to\u2026 listen to music by Black folks. Jazz, R&B more generally. Hip hop. A little bit of everything.I lose it when I\u2019m\u2026 at concerts. That\u2019s my space where I\u2019m very free and excited to see people. Bilal is incredible, Little Dragon\u2014always excellent, and Erykah Badu is my problematic fav.Right now, I\u2019m reading... I\u2019m about to start reading Erena Hogart\u2019s book, Medicalizing Blackness. It\u2019s kind of about the making of racial difference and how scientists started medicalizing the idea of race.A good morning looks like... gym time, meditation, and a good discussion with my students in Introduction to women's, gender, and sexuality studies.\nI find joy in... food, friends, and music! Oh, and videos of Black children being carefree and wonderful.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishPerson of InterestInterviewsRead MoreLifestyleNutrition Goddess Marion Nestle on the One Thing She\u2019d Change About How We EatBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
