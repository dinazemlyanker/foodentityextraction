But flipping is also the key to the best way to cook steak. You should flip it good. Every two minutes. And then baste with brown butter, garlic, and rosemary.The lesson we\u2019ve all been taught is to leave your steak alone, letting it sear undisturbed on one side, flipping, and then letting it cook through to the perfect medium-rare. But lately, our favorite technique is to give steak constant attention, treating it with as much affection as you would a rescue puppy. This method was used in one of our 29 new essential recipes, Brown Butter-Basted Steak, and there are a few key reasons why it works:1. It Cooks More EvenlyA classic grilled rib eye steak gets constant direct heat for at least 4\u20136 minutes per side. Even if you watch it carefully, you often get a medium-rare center with a gray-brown ring of overcooked meat around the exterior. By flipping it often\u2014about every two minutes\u2014you can allow one side to cool while the other forms a deep brown crust. This also allows the juices to distribute evenly throughout the meat as it cooks.2. There\u2019s Time for Brown Butter BastingOnce the steak is a few degrees below the temperature you\u2019re aiming for (120\u00b0\u2013125\u00b0 for medium-rare, which should take about 8 minutes), add 3 Tbsp. unsalted butter, 2 sprigs of rosemary, and 2 crushed garlic cloves to the pan. As you baste the steak with this aromatic mixture, the butter will brown and turn nutty, imparting this flavor into the steak and making it even juicier. It\u2019s also a little trick: If you don\u2019t have a even crust all around, you can pour extra butter in places that need more browning to concentrate the heat in that area. It\u2019s kind of like shallow frying in butter, so use tongs and be careful so it doesn\u2019t splatter. This is not a steak you can walk away from\u2014it needs to be constantly tended to so it doesn\u2019t overcook and gets perfectly brown from edge to edge. Like so:3. You Get a Built-In SauceAfter the steak is cooked and rested for at least 10 minutes, the remaining butter emulsifies with the drippings to make a pan sauce without any extra work. Slice the steak against the grain, sprinkle with flaky salt, and drizzle with lots of sauce. You can get a little creative by adding other hardy aromatics to your butter, like thyme or bay leaf, but the baseline best combination is butter and garlic. Classic steakhouse sides are great, but we also love serving with bitter greens and a citrusy vinaigrette to cut through the fat. But if you went with buttery mashed potatoes for a butter-on-butter situation, no one would complain. They might even flip out.Get the recipe:Brown Butter\u2013Basted SteakHow to make steakhouse-quality steak at home.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titSteakRead Morecooking4 Steaks You Can Actually AffordBy Alex DelanycookingHow to Season a Steak Like a ProBy Alex Delanyrecipes76 of Our Best Steak Recipes, from Rib Eye to Skirt Steak, Fajitas to SkewersGallery76 SlidesRecipes you want to make.
