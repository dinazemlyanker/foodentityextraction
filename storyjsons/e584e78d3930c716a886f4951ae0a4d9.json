Recipe slapped without it though!!!! highly recommend.trentchicago4/22/2021LOVE the hazelnut topping!\nAnnetteArlington, WA12/18/2020This was our favorite dish at Thanksgiving this year. The only thing is we under-grilled the leeks and they were a tiny bit tough to cut. Make sure they are custard-y before serving!! AnonymousMinneapolis, MN11/27/2020This was a great alternative to the usual super sweet or bacon loaded vegetable dishes for Thanksgiving. By all means, make those side dishes, but this really stuck out on flavor amongst all my sides.AnonymousBrooklyn, NY11/26/2020The world is not ready for this level of audacity yet.M L11/19/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titLeekVegetableHazelnutNutFallSideHealthyishThanksgivingRosh HashanahDinnerRecipes you want to make.
