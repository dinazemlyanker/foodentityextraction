She created the recipe after my dad was diagnosed as prediabetic and had to change his diet. At holidays we\u2019d inevitably say, \u201cYou should sell this!\u201d It became kind of a family jest until my brother dared me to actually try.I was a newly single mother with three children under the age of 10, and my job as a documentary filmmaker wasn\u2019t going to cut it. I needed flexible, close-to-home work. So I began mixing dressing in my Maryland kitchen and sharing it with friends. I named my company Dress It Up, because that\u2019s exactly what my mother\u2019s dressing could do: effortlessly elevate any meal. Thanks to my friends\u2019 vocal support, orders came in from strangers. I invested $7,000 in July of that first year to make 60 cases each of Dress It Up\u2019s first four flavors: champagne, red wine, apple cider, and chocolate. By November, it was stocked in my local Whole Foods. But I couldn\u2019t afford to make more.Sophia Maroon, pouring it on.\nPhoto by Alex LauSeven family members and friends each pitched in $5,000, enough for a second, bigger order and part of the third. I wouldn\u2019t be where I am now\u2014founder of an award-winning company with six dressing flavors available nationally\u2014without them.Last year the community helped us out again. We\u2019d planned to launch individual dressing packets designed for salad bars. Then came the pandemic and a warehouse full of product with nowhere to go. For several years, we\u2019d partnered with D.C. public schools to provide our dressing at reduced cost. The school system happily put the packets to use. At every step, community relationships have made our work not just meaningful but possible.The 6 Rules I Live and Work ByRose-Colored Glasses Forever. Believe that what you are trying to do can be done. Every entrepreneur needs that level of conviction.Figure Out What Motivates You. After my unexpected divorce, I had a \u201csay no to nothing\u201d mantra, and that helped my business succeed.Check Your Fear. I was afraid of nothing when I started Dress It Up. The worst thing\u2014an unexpected divorce\u2014had already happened to me. I had a \u201csay no to nothing\u201d mantra, and that helped my business succeed.Nail Your Nonnegotiables. Here are mine: ingredients (no canola oil and no xanthan gum), family first (it\u2019s only salad dressing!), and financial responsibility (I\u2019d secure a loan against my house, but I won\u2019t touch my IRA).Find Investors Who Respect Your Vision. Many investors today want to see a five-year exit plan with a 20-times return. In other words, they want you to grow and make money fast. There\u2019s a lot of pressure! I see growth differently. I couldn\u2019t afford for my company to get too big too fast and flame out. That\u2019s a fun story for an 18-year-old in a college dorm, not for a 40-something mother trying to make ends meet. Slow and steady made the most sense for me.Apply for More Than Money. Last year, Dress It Up was fortunate enough to be a Stacy\u2019s Rise Project winner.
