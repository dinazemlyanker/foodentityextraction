But don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not one briny mouthful, there are a lot of different textures going on between the crisp onions, juicy pickles, and crunchy nuts. We tend to favor pickles that are bright with acid and low on sugar; anything labeled \u201chalf-sour\u201d usually fits the bill. If using sweeter pickles, add a bit more vinegar and salt. And honestly, you can use whatever pickles you want in this (radishes! Green beans!).\u00a0Ingredients4 servings\u00bdcup walnuts4whole pickles (half- or full-sour), halved lengthwise, sliced crosswise into 1\" pieces, plus 3 Tbsp. picklebrine3Tbsp. red wine vinegar2tsp.

Transfer salad to a large shallow bowl or platter and drizzle with oil. Serve with toast to sop up the dressing if desired.How would you rate Crunchy Pickle Salad?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (8)Back to TopTriangleWow this really does work.. Very glad that I read the reviews to this unusual recipe.  We served it with a smoked pork belly, and the acid in the salad really went well with the fattiness of the pork belly.  LynnChristchurch, New Zealand10/23/2021So.. when I read the recipe, it seems like someone who was drunk and hadn\u2019t been to the store in a while was hungry. However, my daughter and I love sour pickles so we made it. SOOOO GOOD!  I ate almost the whole bowl myself, but it was screaming for a brat and a beer to go with it. I added raisins(don\u2019t judge), because my brain was filling in the sweet with the sour. It was awesome!  I also did feta instead of Parmesan because I\u2019m not doing cows milk. I will make this again soon!  StuartLos Angeles, CA6/26/2021What a lovely salad.  It would be awesome for cookout with hamburgers or hotdogs or as a side for some fresh white fish.  Good with any fatty dish.   I made it the first day - EXACTLY AS WRITTEN (although I did forget the olive oil for drizzling.  We weren't in love.  I let it sit in the refrigerator for a couple of days.  It seemed like it kind of fermented a little into a briny deliciousness.  Next time- I will make it 24 hrs. in advance- I would put a little olive oil & garlic on the bread before toasting, and I would only toast lightly so the bread was slightly soft for better sopping.  You will want every drop of the dressing!  Pickle salad - who would have thought it?Wesley Chapel, FLORIDA5/4/2020This is really good! The flavours and textures work together so well. I used ~1/3 of a yellow onion since I didn't have any white onions on hand.AnonymousNew York4/29/2020The unexpected flavor combination in this salad is wonderful! I had to follow the proposed adaption for a sweeter pickle, and didn't have dill, so I substituted fennel fronds and parsley. Would go wonderfully as a side dish for a crispy chicken sandwich! AnonymousSeattle, WA4/11/2020This salad was a great surprise! It might sound unusual to pair fennel, pickle and Parmesan (I actually used grana padano), but the three work wonderfully together. This original salad definitely has a WOW factor.\nLetting the fennel marinate in the dressing really allow its sharp flavor to mellow.\nI feel like it lacks a little taste of citrus. I will try thinly sliced blood oranges next time!baptistePARIS, France3/5/2020Surprisingly delicious. TdMac1Camp Hill, PA3/1/2020This salad is absolutely amazing! This is now in heavy rotation.
