(Steal their ideas!)By Ali FrancisFebruary 8, 2022FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Hazel ZavalaFacebookTwitterEmailI\u2019m going to be honest: I dislike going out for a meal on Valentine\u2019s Day. Nothing kills the vibe more than a heart-shaped helium balloon to the dome. It\u2019s cold outside. I want to take a bath and wear my stretchy pants. I also want to eat delicious food (that\u2019s a smidge more intentional than my usual sheet-pan whatever) while basking in love\u2019s warm glow. But after nearly two years of cooking, working, and everything-ing from home, I\u2019ve lost my romantic mojo. I don\u2019t know how to say \u201cI love you\u201d with anything anymore.My colleagues, it turns out, feel the same. So, for a little inspiration, we asked eight of our favorite food couples\u2014the chefs, restaurateurs, farmers, and general cooking-obsessed people who just happen to be dating each other\u2014to share their ideal Valentine\u2019s Day plans. From hot fudge sundaes on the couch to fancy beef Wellingtons, consider these romantic blueprints for your own dream date night\u2014even if that is just with your cat. Light a candle. Make something nice. That\u2019s\u2026 amore.Photograph by Emma Fishman, food styling by Caroline Hwang, prop styling by Aneta FlorczykDanielle Bell and Pablo Osorio: Peruvian Mussels and Pound CakeAfter meeting through a mutual friend, Danielle Bell, a baker from Louisville, and Pablo Osorio, a chef from Lima, started cooking together early in their relationship. Seeing a barely used paella pan in Bell\u2019s Brooklyn apartment, Osorio suggested that they cook paella for their first dinner party together. In the decade since, their romance has also given rise to their now Los Angeles\u2013based culinary project, de Porres Dinner Series.Cooking together, and for each other, has made sense since the start. Osorio is drawn to savory; Bell dreams in sweets. He introduced her to the best Peruvian food she\u2019d ever had and she showed him Southern techniques and all kinds of baked goods. \u201cFood\u2019s always been something of a love language for us,\u201d Bell says.When they aren\u2019t cooking for work, their ideal date night meal would start with choros a la chalaca, a Peruvian mussel dish. Braised leeks and an Asian pear-shiso salad with fried quinoa would follow. And because their special occasion menus always call for duck\u2014it\u2019s Bell\u2019s favorite meat and a popular protein in northern Peru, where Osorio\u2019s grandmother is from\u2014the main course would be seco de pato, duck legs slow-cooked in a beer-based stew.Dessert is another obvious choice: Bell is known for her riffs on her mom\u2019s pound cake, and this time, it would be flavored with lemon and elderflower and served with roasted strawberries (because what\u2019s a Valentine\u2019s Day menu without strawberries?). \u201cSimple but perfect\u2014you don\u2019t need more than that,\u201d Osorio says. \u2014Bettina Makalintal, associate print editorPhoto by Alex LauBill Clark and Andrew Spena: Shrimp Cocktail and Special CookiesSome couples get to know each other over drinks or park walks. But for Bill Clark and Andrew Spena, their fourth date took place at a restaurant demolition site. \u201cMy apartment was down the block and I happened to be working from home,\u201d Spena recalls. \u201cBill said, \u2018We\u2019re taking down walls, do you want to swing a hammer?\u2019 I came by and he showed me how to demo a wall.\u201d Clark had just signed the lease for the space that would become Brooklyn\u2019s beloved Meme\u2019s Diner, which closed its doors in 2020.When they\u2019re not eating at spots around NYC, Clark and Spena\u2019s date night menus are \u201celevated versions of how we normally cook for each other,\u201d Spena says. \u201cIt\u2019s what sounds the best that day or what will make the other person feel good.\u201d More often than not, that\u2019s shrimp cocktail. \u201cWe poach our own shrimp and make a whole thing out of it,\u201d Clark says. \u201cDate nights are about big star proteins\u2014last year we made the lobster fra diavolo risotto [from my substack A Piece of Cake]. Or we\u2019ll do a big fat rib eye or a little caviar or something special specifically for Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201dThe drinks are always consistent\u2014martinis or Manhattans\u2014as is the hydration: \u201cWhoever is playing bartender will chill the glass with ice and water, then bring that to the other person, who will drink the water. It\u2019s a little way of taking care of each other,\u201d Spena explains. As was true at Meme\u2019s, Clark handles the flowers, Spena is DJ, and, because Clark is an extraordinary baker, there\u2019s always dessert\u2014\u201ceven if it\u2019s just a big plate of fruit and a special cookie.\u201d (Spena, it should be acknowledged, is, in Clark\u2019s words, \u201cthe star dishwasher.\u201d)This year, \u201clike every Valentine\u2019s Day,\u201d Spena says, \u201cwe\u2019ll be working in a restaurant\u201d\u2014specifically, a steakhouse-inspired pop-up at Edy\u2019s Grocer. \u201cWe\u2019ll sit down afterward, eat some of the food ourselves, and celebrate a job well done.\u201d \u2014Sarah Jampel, senior cooking editorPhoto by Alex Lau, styling by Claire SaffitzTrina and Jessica Quinn: PJ\u2019s, Netflix, and Roast Chicken\u201cWorking in the service industry, it\u2019s hard to date \u2018normal people\u2019 because your hours are all over the place,\u201d says Jessica Quinn, who met her wife, Trina, on OKCupid. For the 10 years they\u2019ve been a couple, those all-over-the-place hours meant they never spent Valentine\u2019s Day together. Instead, they were working. Most recently Jessica was executive pastry chef at Rezd\u00f4ra in Manhattan, and Trina was the sous-chef at Red Hook Tavern in Brooklyn.The pandemic brought changes\u2014most notably the opportunity to launch their own culinary project, Dacha 46, an ode to Jessica\u2019s Latvian-Ukrainian heritage that includes pop-ups, collaborative dinners, and frozen pelmeni. It also meant that, last year, they were able to spend their first Valentine\u2019s Day together. \u201cThe vibe was pajamas-slash-sweats,\u201d Jessica recalls. \u201cI hate to admit it, but we\u2019re eat-on-the-couch-while-binge-watching-something people.\u201d Trina clarifies, \u201cOur shows of choice are serial killer documentaries or ghost-hunting shows.\u201d Qu\u00e9 rom\u00e1ntico!As for the food, big fussy meals are out. \u201cWe spend so much time cooking fancy things for other people,\u201d Jessica explains. Instead, their ideal V-Day menu starts with a giant cheese and charcuterie board with cornichons and olives. Then, roast chicken\u2014specifically Trina\u2019s spatchcocked chicken spiced with paprika, garlic, and lemon, pan-seared under a brick and served with mashed potatoes. \u201cShe makes me make mashed potatoes for everything, and I don\u2019t even like mashed potatoes,\u201d laments Trina, to which an exasperated Jessica responds, \u201cWhat type of person doesn\u2019t like mashed potatoes?!\u201dFor dessert, it\u2019s ice cream sundaes with Jessica\u2019s hot fudge sauce and vanilla H\u00e4agen-Dazs. (\u201cNOT vanilla bean. I\u2019m very specific,\u201d Jessica clarifies). To drink? Shots from a giant bottle of Beluga vodka, paired with pickles. \u2014MacKenzie Chung Fegan, senior commerce editorPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Anna Billingskog, Prop Styling Astrid ChastkaNorma Listman and Saqib Keval: Big Cheeseboard Energy\u201cI always joke that we [found each other] on Craigslist, Missed Connections,\u201d says Saqib Keval. He\u2019s talking about meeting his now wife, Norma Listman, back in 2014 while both were working at a mutual friend\u2019s Oakland restaurant\u2014Listman as a consultant during the day, Keval as a chef in the evenings. Luckily, neither had to post online to reconnect after their first encounter. \u201cI was more annoyed than anything at first,\u201d Listman jokes, explaining how the two kept bumping into each other in the kitchen over the next few months.It wasn\u2019t until the first time they worked together directly, for the community-based dining and activism project, People\u2019s Kitchen Collective, that everything changed. \u201cI heard him speak, and I was like, \u2018Oh, this guy is actually very smart\u2014and cute,\u2019\u201d she says. From there, the two began dating, opened their restaurant Masala y Maiz in Mexico City in 2017, and got married in 2019.On their dream date, Listman and Keval are all about simple, high-quality food. The menu: \u201cSteak over a fire, in a cast iron, with a lot of salad\u2014perfect tomatoes, beautiful bread, butter, and wine,\u201d Listman says. \u201cThat\u2019s actually what we had on one of our first dates,\u201d Keval says. Forgoing the pastries or the ubiquitous V-Day chocolaty treat, they would opt for a cheeseboard, with fresh, seasonal fruit to round out the evening. \u201cWe\u2019re not big dessert people,\u201d says Keval, who would prefer \u201ca really perfect peach or nectarine.\u201d Listman agrees: \u201cTopped with chili-lime salt and sugar.\u201dIn an ideal world, their date night would take place at a secluded getaway house on the Northern California coast. \u201cWe\u2019re in Mexico City right now and it\u2019s great, but I miss that cold breeze\u2014the fog, the chilly dampness, how lush and green it is,\u201d Listman says, imagining herself taking in the Pacific with a martini in hand. \u201c[We\u2019d] live in our own little world\u201d for a night, Keval says. \u2014Antara Sinha, associate cooking editorMarcus NilssonAngie Rito and Scott Tacinelli: Red Sauce Vibes\u201cI always joke that we bonded over caponata,\u201d says Angie Rito about her husband, Scott Tacinelli. \u201cHe was talking about caponata, I was talking about my grandpa\u2019s recipe, and we were just comparing notes.\u201d That shared love of Italian food became the foundation for their NYC restaurant, Don Angie, their cookbook, Italian American, and their own family.The couple met just after Rito moved to New York. Tacinelli was fresh out of culinary school, working as a line cook at the same restaurant where Rito happened to be waitressing part-time. \u201cScott started showing me all these iconic New York restaurants,\u201d Rito remembers, \u201cand that\u2019s how we started hanging out.\u201dWhile running a restaurant, living, and raising a child together isn\u2019t always easy, Rito and Tacinelli have found a rhythm that works for them. \u201cIt takes a lot of patience, flexibility, and trust in the other person,\u201d Tacinelli says. Rito says the arrival of their first son last year put things into perspective. \u201cIt got so easy for us to get too caught up in our work life, but he\u2019s really opened our eyes to how important our personal life is too.\u201dTheir ideal dinner date, like their restaurant\u2019s food, is magnificently Italian American: Tortellini in brodo and a simple Caesar salad to start, followed by a classic pasta in red sauce with a couple of meatballs (although they\u2019d opt for big bites of paccheri over spaghetti), and a bottle of Lambrusco to wash it down. \u2014Nico Avalle, production assistantPhotograph by Christopher Testani. Food styling by Victoria Granof. Prop styling by Alex Brannian.Elliott Curelop and Harshit Gupta: Something Sentimental\u201cNeither one of us is an all-out romantic,\u201d Elliott Curelop tells me about his relationship with Harshit Gupta, his husband and cofounder of their Austin-based company, Madhu Chocolate. I believe him for about 30 seconds, until the two start talking about their past Valentine\u2019s Day celebrations\u2014namely the one when Gupta surprised Curelop with dinner by some secluded waterfalls. Oh, and the one when they drove eight hours to a brewery in Valentine, Texas, to spend the day together.The couple met online in August 2013. About a year later, they got engaged, moved from Seattle to Austin, got married, and then started Madhu Chocolate in 2018. Bean-to-bar chocolate-making began as a hobby; now, they sell bars nationwide with Indian-inspired flavors like masala peanut, rose pistachio, and Idukki black pepper. And this year, just in time for Valentine\u2019s Day, they\u2019ve introduced a new pistachio-chocolate spread that I have obviously already purchased.This year Curelop is cooking on the big night\u2014something sentimental from their shared past\u2014and Gupta will follow up a few days later. I can\u2019t ask them to ruin this year\u2019s surprise, so Curelop tells me about a past meal: \u201cA restaurant we went to just before I proposed had special compound butters, like red wine butter and saffron butter. So I re-created those. I made a beef Wellington based on our first vacation and a baked Alaska inspired by the very first cruise we took together. It was the heaviest meal in the world, but it was really enjoyable because it was a trip down memory lane.\u201dIt\u2019s not all home cooking, though: Gupta says they ended that day in Valentine, Texas, a few years back, eating fast food at a campground hotel. \u201cFor us, looking at the stars and eating Dairy Queen, I think it was one of the best meals we\u2019ve had.\u201d \u2014Sonia Chopra, executive editorPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Olivia Mack McCoolNick Doherty and Kate Woods: Fish Tacos Alfresco\u201cI remember we were weeding,\u201d says Nick Doherty. Over Zoom, he and Kate Woods are describing their first real conversation: crouched between rows of vegetables while working as field managers at Stone Barns Center for Food & Agriculture in 2017. It wasn\u2019t until 2019 that they started dating, \u201cbut that moment was when the seed was planted,\u201d Doherty laughs.Four years later, in March 2021 and with a new border collie pup in tow, Doherty and Woods moved to Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts, to comanage Beetlebung Farm\u2014where they grow a biologically diverse range of herbs and vegetables using regenerative agriculture principles. The pair were both drawn to community-based farming and the \u201cbeauty of sharing food directly with people,\u201d Woods says. \u201cI think we really bonded over that.\u201dOn their ideal at-home date, they\u2019d hang outside on their candlelit porch while listening to Nina Simone radio. With an abundance of thoughtfully raised meat, dairy, and seafood on the island and a lush farm in their backyard, the couple would make the most of what\u2019s around for dinner: fried fish tacos with homegrown radishes, pickled onions, and Napa cabbage, and \u201csome really good yogurt sauces,\u201d Woods says. Alongside, she says, there\u2019d be a simple radicchio salad\u2014\u201cit\u2019s one of our favorite things to grow and Nick is the best salad-dressing-maker ever\u201d\u2014and a bottle of biodynamic Marquette from Vermont-based winery La Garagista. Dessert is honey and lavender gelato made with \u201cawesome raw milk from down the road,\u201d Doherty says.As we\u2019re about to say goodbye, I ask the couple how they set boundaries when work and life happen side by side. \u201cI feel like we're both extremely independent people,\u201d Woods says, \u201cand we like to be outside a lot.\u201d Doherty agrees, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re not sick of each other yet, so\u2026\u201d \u2014Ali Francis, associate editorPhotograph by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, Food Styling by Alison Roman, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiDeborah VanTrece and Lorraine Lane: Prime Rib and R&BWhen it comes to running a restaurant, how do business and life partners Deborah VanTrece and Lorraine Lane of Atlanta\u2019s Twisted Soul Cookhouse & Pours work so well together? \u201cWe\u2019re best friends,\u201d they both say. \u201cWe laugh a lot,\u201d VanTrece says\u2014and Lane adds, \u201cI stay in my lane.\u201d It\u2019s been a family operation since they opened it in 2014: Lane handles the books and the behind-the-scenes, VanTrece is the creative director and chef, and their daughter is the general manager.Like many in the restaurant industry, Valentine\u2019s Day ends up being more of a work night than a date night, though Lane always makes sure VanTrece has roses. But the romance they can\u2019t share with each other\u2014that night, at least\u2014is what they want to impress upon their guests at Twisted Soul: setting the mood with red light bulbs, red roses, and the soft sounds of smooth jazz or Luther Vandross.Once they\u2019ve gotten a chance to decompress, their own ideal date night could go a few ways. It might be pork neck bones and potatoes or prime rib and sea bass. Or, if they\u2019re really tired, it might just be picking up Waffle House to-go. There are nonnegotiables, of course: cocktails, Champagne, and chocolate-covered strawberries. And ideally, a charcuterie board to share\u2014with blue cheese for VanTrece and smoked Gouda for Lane, plus almonds, olives, really good mustard, and soppressata. Then, add a little jazz or R&B and get the fireplace going.\u201cOne of the things I\u2019ll say to her\u2014which is really important to me\u2014is \u2018be romantica,\u2019\u201d VanTrece says with a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s what I call it. I think that\u2019s what is important, with even the foods you choose the vibe you\u2019re giving. We all should keep romantica in our relationships.\u201d \u2014Bettina Makalintal, associate print editorExplore Bon App\u00e9titCultureRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
