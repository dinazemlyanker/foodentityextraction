But it\u2019s not just the ingredients that flirt with that other classic, there\u2019s also something to the method. The bread in this recipe gets a long soak\u2014about 10 minutes on each side\u2014which delivers a remarkably custardy interior.If you don\u2019t have cream on hand, you can substitute with extra whole milk (this is not the time for skim). Use Pullman, brioche, or challah\u2014all tender, spongy breads that can stand up to the dairy drench\u2014and slice the bread thickly to keep it from falling apart. There\u2019s no need to dry out the slices, but if the loaf has been sitting on the counter for a day or two, all the better. Cooking the toast in a combination of butter and vegetable oil results in golden brown, lightly crisp edges and prevents things from getting too brown too quickly.Of course, there are lots of ways to make French toast, and no one said you had to stick with the classics. If you or your guests are dairy-free, consider these crispy French toast soldiers, which are made with orange juice instead of milk. When you\u2019re entertaining a crowd for brunch\u2014or hosting family for the holidays\u2014French toast casserole is the way to go. It can be prepared almost entirely the night before; in the morning, simply brush it with butter and bake.Editor\u2019s note: This recipe was originally published in December 2014.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Perfectly cooked! I just added cinnamon to the mixture and served with sliced almonds and strawberries and it hit so hard. SimmySan Jose, CA3/6/2022If you cut the bread the night before and let it dry out overnight (or dry in a low oven for 30 minutes or so) it will both soak up more and hold together better\n\nShishkabobcanolieMerritt Island, FL3/6/2022I add orange zest which gives it a nice sparkle!  And vanilla, of course!\n\nClaudette MHamilton Ontario3/6/2022Sooo good! Added cinnamon, vanilla extract, and nutmeg. Can\u2019t wait to remake for my boyfriend and I!Brittany Chicago, IL7/6/2021I made the recipe with a supermarket French baguette, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. If you don't use brioche and you soak the bread 10 minutes per side, good luck getting it out of the custard in one piece! Cutting it fairly thick will help.\n\nYou probably don't need to add more butter and oil to the pan between batches, either. RichSPKWorcester, MA 2/1/2021Such a good recipe! I added cinnamon into the egg & cream mixture because I can't imagine French toast without a little warm spicy goodness. Made with brioche but mine wasn't as thick as the recipe so beware of not letting it get too soggy. Otherwise this is such a great recipe!! AnonymousMinneapolis6/15/2020Just made this for breakfast! I cut this recipe in half and it was perfect. I used brioche bread from Trader Joe\u2019s and added a dash of cinnamon to the custard. Topped with ripe strawberries and a dash of strawberries. Would 100% remake! AnonymousLos Angeles3/15/2020Sorry not a review... but a question. If I can edit this I will add my review afterwards... is that a typo or am I reading it incorrectly. Soak the bread for 10 mins per side???AnonymousNC11/19/2019Holy hell, this is amazing. More of a bread pudding texture than the french toast I'm used to, and it has OPENED MY EYES to what french toast was meant to be! I added a dash of vanilla to the custard and used homemade cinnamon milk bread for it, and all I have to say is: WOW. And so simple! It really is the kind of thing that can be thrown together in between the other steps of my morning routine. honeybeebutchMinneapolis8/31/2019Loved this recipe! Will definitely be using it one again.Atlanta,GA8/13/2019An absolute winner! I did a test run for mother's day a few days in advance, following the steps as written, and was more than happy with the results. The only thing that I did differently for mother's day was add cinnamon, vanilla, and a dash of almond extract to the custard. Since I was making a lot for mothers day (30 pieces), I fried three pieces at a time two hours before everyone arrived but did NOT put them into the 250 degree oven. Instead, I placed them onto cookie sheets to cool and cooked them in a 400 degree oven when everyone arrived until warm and the custard was set. I used homemade brioche bread made in loaf pans and cut each slice diagonally before dredging. AnonymousVoorhees NJ USA5/16/2019I fell in love \ud83d\ude0d AnonymousMiami3/27/2019Straightforward and delicious made with an old italian loaf.   The perfect basic recipe that can be dressed up on weekends.   Anonymous3/20/2019I like the recipe and the soaking technique. However, there are a few missing ingredients that make French toast, well, French toast: a teaspoon of vanilla extract and plenty of cinnamon! Perhaps there are regional differences in preferences.  I also add a dash of freshly grated nutmeg. Sometimes I add a dash of Penzey's Pie Spice in place of the cinnamon and nutmeg. I have not used heavy cream with the milk before; that is a nice adjustment I plan to make.wilron8628connecticut3/19/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titEasyNut-FreeVegetarianEasterBreakfastRecipes you want to make.
