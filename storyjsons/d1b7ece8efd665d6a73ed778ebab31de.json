The team makes everything in-house, from the intensely meaty broth to the squiggly noodles, and each bowl is perfectly calibrated with a splash of hot broth, a mound of noodles, a scattering of scallions, some grated daikon, and a lemon slice for the most satisfying udon you\u2019ll ever eat.THE VIBE IS: very Tokyo. The tiny noodle counter has has that same handmade feel with wood desk-like seating made by Nishioka\u2019s wife, an aspiring carpenter. It has that kind of intimate, convivial atmosphere you\u2019d find at a yakitori stall. Even though it\u2019s hidden in a Japanese food court at Lesley College, you won\u2019t miss it. Lines form early before the shop opens, so prepare yourself accordingly.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Tuesday through Thursday, 5 p.m. to 9 p.m., and Friday and Saturday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. Closed Sunday and Monday. Make sure you bring cash.Photo by Elizabeth CecilPhoto by Elizabeth CecilWE ALSO LOVEMamaleh\u2019sIn Boston, the old-school Jewish deli is new againShepardThe smartest restaurant in CambridgeSofraThe Middle Eastern pastry shop/caf\u00e9 that Ottolenghi hits when he\u2019s in townExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
