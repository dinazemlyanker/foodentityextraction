Next up, contributor Alana Al-Hatlani writes about her love for her AeroGarden.I am not a plant person. I kill everything, even the plants that \u201cthrive on neglect.\u201d But as an aspirational green thumb, I\u2019m always trying desperately to grow food within the confines of my one-bedroom apartment. I want to be able to produce my own fresh ingredients, even if I don\u2019t have the traditional garden space to do so. My mother, an illustrious gardener, gifted me the solution last Christmas: the AeroGarden, an indoor gardening system small enough to sit on your kitchen counter.Photography by Isa Zapata. \u00a0Prop Styling by Paige HicksAeroGarden Sprout$100 $70 at AeroGarden$100 $70 at AmazonI have the smallest model, the AeroGarden Sprout, which uses biodegradable seed pods\u2014they look like elongated Keurig cups but are packed full with peat instead of coffee\u2014to hydroponically grow up to three plants at once. I began my AeroGarden journey with the heirloom salad kit, which included three lettuce varieties: Black Seeded Simpson, Deer Tongue, and Parris Island\u2014all lettuces I would be hard-pressed to find at my local grocer. Each variety sprouted in a few days and was ready to harvest in just over three weeks. I plucked enough fresh lettuce for a side salad with dinner each night and ditched those boxed salad mixes, half of which always wilted before I could get around to eating them.Next, I grew herbs and had fresh basil and dill at my disposal for months. I stopped buying those clamshells from the grocery store, which are both relatively expensive and packaged in single-use plastic. During much of the pandemic, when I was trying to limit grocery trips but also had to contend with shortages, having fresh lettuce and herbs at home was especially convenient. Now I\u2019m experimenting with hot peppers and more salad greens in Aerogarden\u2019s Grow Anything pods, which allow you to seed any plant of your choosing.I love that the AeroGarden requires only water and the liquid plant food supplied with it to start growing. There\u2019s no soil, so no mess, and a light on the device automatically lets you know when it needs more water or food. (If only regular plants could communicate this way.) While small enough to sit on a window sill, the device doesn\u2019t require natural light, which means it can live anywhere as long as it can reach an outlet. The LED grow lights operate on a timed cycle but are quite bright, so I program them to be on during the day to avoid light beaming like a UFO into my bedroom at night. With how easy the AeroGarden Sprout is to operate, I like to think of it as my Tamagotchi\u2014except way harder to kill.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendShoppingCultureRecipes you want to make.
