You know, that cartoonishly perfect brioche spackled with ricotta and a pool of seasonal jam? Who can rival it?Funny you should ask. Because the last time I was in L.A., I found new toasts to obsess over, and they all come from Hail Mary, a funky little pizza parlor in Atwater Village. Pies make up the majority of chef (and Gjelina alum) David Wilcox\u2019s menu, but the breakfast toasts are so well considered, they\u2019re not to be missed.There\u2019s the coriander-cured salmon with marinated cucumbers and a thick schmear of fatty cream cheese. There\u2019s the cloud-like creamed ricotta toast, speckled with sesame seeds and drizzled with honey, atop hearty whole wheat slices. There\u2019s the thick sourdough slathered with ricotta, some seasonal chunky fruit jam, and pistachio butter, which is made with organic nuts from Santa Barbara Pistachio Company. \u201cThey\u2019re the most expensive ingredient we have at the restaurant!\u201d Wilcox told me over the phone. \u201cBut I love them so much that I wanted to turn them into the star of the show.\u201dAll that, and none of the crazy, Sqirl-level waits? All hail Hail Mary.Go there: Hail MaryExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsLos AngelesRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
