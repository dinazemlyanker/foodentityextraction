Toss peppers, chiles, garlic, and oil in a Dutch oven or heavy roasting pan; season with salt and pepper and toss again to coat. Cover and roast, tossing occasionally, until peppers are very tender, 2\u20132\u00bd hours. Let cool.Step 2Arrange half of peppers on a platter. Top peppers with mozzarella and basil. Measure out 3 Tbsp. of the oily juices left behind and transfer to a small bowl (save remaining peppers and their juices for another use; we love them tossed with pasta, layered into sandwiches, or stirred into frittatas). Add vinegar; season with salt. Stir to combine, then drizzle dressing over salad.Step 3Do Ahead: Peppers can be roasted 1 week ahead. Cover and chill.How would you rate Roasted Pepper Caprese?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (3)Back to TopTriangleI made this recipe using about 12 ounces of peppers.  I used mini bell peppers, split them in half to remove the seeds and white part.  I also added in one poblano and quartered it.  I only had to cook them for about an hour and had no issues with the skins being left on.  I really liked this recipe but will use a spicier pepper in the future.  Highly recommend you salt well, especially if using fresh mozzarella.AnonymousAustin, Texas5/26/2020Question for the other reviewer here\u2026.what herbs do you recommend? Also, I see that many italian cooks only remove the skins, and then marinade in a combination of olive oil, garlic, herbs and maybe capers. Doen's the slow roasting for 2 hours make them too soft or even mushy? Vinyljunkee3Michigan7/18/2019Love peppers, but I would always skin them, Italian style. Few things are worse than soggy pepper skins, in my book. Get them nice and blistered, skin them and the cook them low and slow (way lower than 350 degrees, more like 225) for a couple of hours in ample olive oil with garlic and herbs. Delicious and a staple in my fridge. andreasduessToronto8/26/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titItalianEuropeanItalian AmericanAmericanBell PepperVegetableMozzarellaCheeseBasilHerbs & SpicesSummerEasy5 Ingredients or FewerSideVegetarianGluten-FreeNut-FreeHealthyishRoastLunchDinnerRecipes you want to make.
