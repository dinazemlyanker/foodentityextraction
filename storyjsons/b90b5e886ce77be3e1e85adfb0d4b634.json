First, the chicken is marinated overnight in a buttermilk mixture that\u2019s supercharged with finely chopped preserved lemon (if you don\u2019t have preserved lemon, just double the lemon zest and add an extra pinch of salt). Then it\u2019s dredged in a mixture of rice flour and cornstarch, which results in a shatteringly crisp exterior that stays audibly crunchy for hours. You could substitute all-purpose flour for rice flour if needed, but it won\u2019t be as crunchy\u2014or gluten-free. (Read more about why rice flour makes the best dredge here!) Finally, the chicken is tossed in a sweet, spicy, and sticky harissa-honey sauce.When it comes to the heat level, it all depends on the harissa you use. This condiment\u2014originally from Tunisia but used in many dishes throughout North Africa and the Middle East\u2014can vary from mild to fiery depending on the brand. For the glossiest popcorn chicken, look for a jarred version that is saucy and loose in texture. I love New York Shuk, Belazu, and Villa Jerada\u2014or you can make your own. \u2014Asha LoupyAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.
