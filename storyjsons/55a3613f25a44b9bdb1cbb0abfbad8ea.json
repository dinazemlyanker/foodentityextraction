And it looks like a snowy mountain.By Alex BeggsJune 12, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Heidi's BridgeFacebookTwitterEmailWhen it\u2019s hot enough that I\u2019m inspired to shave my legs again, I start making icebox cakes\u2014and I don\u2019t stop until the radiator clinks and clangs back to life. And this new recipe, a blackberry icebox cake with Nilla wafers and you-don\u2019t-need-to-know-anything-else, is by far our easiest one yet. Of all people, I should know: I\u2019ve made every Bon App\u00e9tit icebox cake, some multiple times. (I\u2019m a dedicated student of the form.) And while they\u2019re all pretty simple, I swear that I could make this one in my sleep.Let\u2019s get one thing out of the way first: Contrary to popular belief, icebox cake is not a frozen dessert. It never goes in the freezer, despite the \u201cice\u201d in the name. Instead it gets refrigerated for a few hours. (Seriously though: When was the last time people called the fridge an \u201cicebox\u201d anyway? I\u2019m going to go with 1869. It\u2019s been a while. But maybe, if we make and eat enough of this cake, we\u2019ll bring it back.)The fridge is the key to icebox cake success; that\u2019s where the action happens while you go to the beach or take a nap outside or get a sunburn or otherwise live your life. Instead of dealing with any kind of dough, or putting something in the oven, or stirring a curd on the stove, you simply assemble and chill it. And it\u2019s fun! A layer of cookies, a layer of fruit and jam, a layer of whipped cream, and then you do that over and over until you\u2019ve run out of stuff. And in those anticipatory overnight hours, all of the layers soften and bleed together to create a divine mousse-like cake. Again: FUN!If you are the kind of person who makes their own jam, well, use it!\nPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca JurkevichAs always, creative genius (and senior food editor) Claire Saffitz has managed to improve on the form. Instead of assembling the thing in a loaf pan or freeform on a plate, you build this icebox cake inside of a Cling Wrap-lined mixing bowl, which not only produces a freestanding icebox cake that looks cool as hell, but also makes it much easier to transport to someone else\u2019s house. When it\u2019s good and chilled, all you have to do is flip it onto a platter, peel the clingy business off, and cover it with a final swipe of whipped cream and some more berries. It looks like something that would appear on Marie Antoinette\u2019s dessert buffet. (If this isn\u2019t the aesthetic you\u2019re going for when making a cake, are you even living?)Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.I made it recently to inaugurate grilling season, and since strawberries were looking good at the market, I used those and plenty of Tiptree\u2019s strawberry jam\u2014a new addition to my icebox lineup after reading this persuasive piece about it. Another tweak I made: Because I don\u2019t plan ahead very well, I assembled the cake 9 hours before serving instead of 24. The result was that the Nilla wafers weren\u2019t fully mushified under all that cream, and they retained just a bit of their soft cookie chew. My dinner guests all said that they really dug the \u201ctextural contrast\u201d \ud83d\ude44. The next morning, after the full 24 hours, the semi-crunchy cake was completely transformed into the familiar, uniformly-silky mess I crave all summer. It\u2019s hard to say if one version is better than the other; neither deserve the guillotine, that\u2019s for sure.So clear out all the excess mustard from your fridge, buy the first box of Nilla Wafers you\u2019ve had in a long time, and on a day so hot you dread the sight of pants, make your friends an icebox cake.Get the recipe:Blackberry Icebox CakeThe no-bake dessert you'll be making all summer.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titWhipped CreamSummer DessertsBlackberryBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
