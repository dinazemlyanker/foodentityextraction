Here are some tips to help maintain your sanity\u2014and have some fun while doing it.1. Before you even start, pick a theme.I am not into menus, per se, but I am into themes. Not themes like, \u201cwear a Hawaiian shirt, make rum punch, and watch Point Break\u201d (although 10/10 would do), but more like \u201cRed Sauce Night\u201d or \u201cTaco Tuesday.\u201d The goal isn\u2019t to turn your home into dinner theater, but to set gentle guidelines and get the ball rolling. It\u2019s extremely helpful for those of us who struggle with indecision (hi!). Regardless of what dream you\u2019re dreaming, apply the same sensibilities you would to any meal. For example, I love a lemony salad, a starchy side, and a big hunk of meat no matter what. Sometimes that means Steakhouse Night, but it could just as easily be \u201cGrecian Vacation\u201d or \u201cHomemade Stouffer\u2019s\u201d (that\u2019s a fun one). Picking a focus, even if you stray, is a good place to start.2. Do it ahead.Honestly I should really take my own advice on this one, but every time I do work ahead, my stress level decreases by about 65 percent. Season your meat, tear your lettuce for the salad, batch those martinis\u2014literally ANYTHING you can cross off a to-do list, even if that means writing a to-do list just to cross something off of it.3. Your house is not a restaurant and you should not feel pressure to make it one.Use all the quirky imperfections to your advantage: Mix martinis in pitchers and serve them in tumblers (charming!) and sit on the floor when there \u201caren\u2019t enough chairs\u201d (homey!).4. Turn your guests into contributors and collaborators.Asking your friends to buy ice, pick herbs, make a sauce, or wash dishes makes the whole thing feel like a group effort. By the end of the night you\u2019ll all be looking into property for your new commune.5. You need to serve dessert, but you don\u2019t need to make dessert.Though I used to be a pastry chef, I would rarely serve dessert were it not for two things: (1) my desire to please those for whom it is nonnegotiable (a.k.a. most people I invite over) and (2) my desire to place a proverbial and sometimes literal cherry on top of an evening (do you get it?). I don\u2019t mean to send you down a YouTube rabbit hole trying to learn how to make a 17-layer cake\u2014you can go as big or as small as you have the physical and emotional space for. A bowl of fruit on ice. A box of wafer cookies. An upside-down apricot tart using store-bought puff pastry, say. There are few times where the phrase \u201cIt\u2019s the thought that counts\u201d applies, and this is one of those times.Get Alison\u2019s full Steakhouse Night at Home Menu:1 / 5ChevronChevronLow-and-Slow Rib RoastView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titEntertainingPartyDinnerRead MorecookingWhen a House Full of Hungry Friends Calls, Alison Roman Makes Brothy MeatballsBy Alison RomancookingIf You Can Open a Cheap Beer, You Can Make This CocktailBy Alison RomancookingBless Your Next Party with Big Dip EnergyBy Alison RomanLifestyle30-Something Dinner Parties Are the Best Dinner PartiesBy Amiel Stanek and Lauren SchaeferRecipes you want to make.
