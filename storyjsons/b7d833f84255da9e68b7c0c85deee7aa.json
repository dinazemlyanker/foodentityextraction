I remember the day I splurged on my first fancy apron.I was in Portland, Oregon, and a friend told me to check out Alder & Co., an irresistibly adorable store that stocks a mix of luxe home goods (like linen bedding and quilted throws), cool-girl jewelry, gifty things like handmade beeswax candles and one-of-a-kind ceramics, and a wall of tantalizing skincare products in modern packaging. I had my hands full, but when I started browsing the womenswear section, I discovered a thing I had never seen before: an apron that cost more than $100. It was creamy white linen with narrow navy pinstripes, designed in a flowy cross-back style with two angled oval pockets. Considering an apron is a thing you expect to get dirty so your real clothes can stay clean, it seemed like a lot to spend. By the time I had that thought, I had already slid the apron off its hanger and was admiring its shape and also its weight.\u201cHow can I justify spending this much on an apron?\u201d I whispered to the apron.\u201cYou wear aprons a lot,\u201d the apron whispered back. \u201cIt\u2019s for work.\u201dFor work! Yes! That was the ticket. This apron would be part of my ~uniform~, I thought, and since I don\u2019t think twice about spending money on kitchen clogs\u2014another essential piece of ~equipment~, why would I hesitate now!?? It was a professional investment! Like a wireless mouse, kind of!Would you just look at that apron! (Oh ya, and Natalie Portman\u2019s there too.)\nI bought the apron, obviously. And I did wear it at work! I wore it when I cooked, and I wore it in my Back to Back Chef video with Natalie Portman. I felt like a million bucks that day. The apron basically became famous by association, in my mind at least, and every time I put it on, I felt not only professional, but special. I never for one second regretted that purchase.This is where the story takes a turn. That very apron was stolen from the test kitchen\u2014or maybe it went missing? Either way, I never saw it again. Alder & Co. closed their Portland location, so I couldn\u2019t get another one the next time I went out there.This is where the story has a happy ending: Alder & Co. reopened in upstate New York, and they still carry the same brand of aprons. When I caught wind of this, I didn\u2019t hesitate: I am now the proud owner of two aprons (one in peach and one in blue; the colors vary with each season), and I love wearing them, whether I\u2019m filming a video or not. I suppose this is what it\u2019s like for other women who eventually buy multiple fancy bags and stack up their array of designer bracelets. That\u2019s cool, too! I\u2019ll be over here, collecting aprons\u2014after all, they\u2019re for work!Buy it: Alder & Co.
