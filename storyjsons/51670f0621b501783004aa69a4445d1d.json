The past seven months have taught me one thing: You never know when you\u2019ll need a fork, especially when eating with your hands is inadvisable. I\u2019ll do just about anything to avoid the guilt of disposable cutlery, but after failing to remember to make a pit stop at my cutlery drawer before leaving my apartment one too many times, I got a bit desperate. Trust me when I say that attempting to eat mac and cheese with a butter knife is simply not worth the stress.But lately, Final\u2019s spork has been a regular in my bag. In a feat of trademarked engineering, the full-size stainless-steel utensil collapses down into a palm-size silicone container, protected from leaky bottles of hand sanitizer, inky pens, and whatever else is jostling around in my tote bag. When lunchtime arrives, it unfolds with a pleasant snap, unfurling from discreet metal joints with the momentum of a brand-new umbrella. And although it\u2019s just one drop in the single-use plastic bucket, it feels good to skip the disposable stuff.This collapsible cutlery tech comes for forks too, but if you haven\u2019t handled a spork since elementary school, let me remind you of its benefits before you cast it aside. The wide curve is perfect for cradling soft-serve or potato salad, the tines are sharp enough to capture stray cherry tomatoes or crisped chickpeas making a break for the grass. In other words, it can handle just about any take-out situation that doesn\u2019t require chopsticks or a steak knife. I\u2019ll even break out my spork on restaurant patios when the dinky cutlery on hand isn\u2019t up to the task of tackling my lunch.I never thought I\u2019d be sitting down to wax poetic about a collapsible spork. But in a year of plot twists worthy of an R.L. Stine choose-your-own-adventure novel, at least I know I\u2019ll have a spork handy.Final Spork$30 at Final$30 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendShoppingRecipes you want to make.
