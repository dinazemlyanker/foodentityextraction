I made them exactly as written and everyone loved them.   I may try adding garlic like some of the other commenters suggested the next time around, but it's fantastic as written.\n\nAlso, I made these several hours in advance and popped them back in the over right before serving with no issues.\n\nGreat recipe, thank you, Andy! AmyNew York, NY3/3/2022Fantastic recipe. Agree with cutting back on sugar to 1/4 cup. Also agree with adding garlic and adding extra pepper flakes. Made this for New Years and did not have any any left. AnonymousMurfreesboro, TN1/2/2022Delicious!  The sauce is abundant - use more carrots.  One has all the ingredients in the pantry....except, of course, the carrots.  I used whole carrots, peeled, cut into 2\" pieces. Raw carrots are hard, but a Cutco knife will make the job easy.  Whole carrots are much more flavorful than the mini, processed carrots.  Andrea TaylorChicago, IL12/5/2021Can these be made ahead and reheated?ShelleyMae10/10/2021Five Stars!!!  AnonymousTulsa OK4/4/2021Excellent recipe! I would decrease brown sugar to 1/4c. I added a crushed garlic clove also. I would definitely make again!\n\nMichaelMpls, MN4/4/2021Really good, but a little too sweet (even for a sweet tooth). The sea salt was a must. Would definitely make again but would cut back on the brown sugar. Also only took me 40 minutes to cook before the sugars started to turn. I added a couple of crushed garlic cloves, which was nice. Anonymous10/31/2020I usually make honeyed carrots but wanted a maple version to top a salad I was making. I added a few whole cloves of garlic I had laying around and this was a great recipe.  I will definitely make it again. The note in the recipe to keep an eye at the end - pay heed to this because indeed mine started to get a little too toasty especially the thinner pieces so I'd wished I'd kept a better eye on it.  Next time!  AnonymousSeattle, WA10/17/2020My favorite way to make carrots. Sometimes I use honey instead of brown sugar and either way they\u2019re great. Perfect mix of sweet, salty, and spicy.Detroit, MI9/29/2020Delicious! I absolutely loved that sweet glaze. I think I'll be stepping up the chili flakes next time because I like it hot and not enough of it came through for me once everything was done, but that's a small nitpick. Do NOT skip out on the flaky sea salt, it's the perfect finishing touch that makes the dish in my opinion. heyguysitsmerobRaleigh, NC7/30/2020Easy and delicious comfort food! I did a mix of carrots and parsnips to make a full recipe. I cut down the sugar & syrup to ~1/4 c. and I only roasted for about 40 minutes total because the sugars started to get a little burned off around that time. Watch closely towards the end! Would definitely make this again, and will try it with a different combo of root veggies as well!AnonymousPhiladelphia4/18/2020This was very yummy, but a little too sweet for me personally. More like a candied carrot dessert, but nonetheless delicious (note: I eat very little sugar usually so may be more sensitive to it). I\u2019ll be trying it again but with half the maple/sugar next time! I love the idea of using cubed butter instead of oil, and it somehow doesn\u2019t burn in the oven but adds to the caramelized crust. Anonymous3/10/2020Absolutely the best way to eat carrots.  These were a big, big hit when I made them for a potluck dinner with everybody commenting on them and asking for the recipe.  Thanks BA for another great recipe!!!AnonymousYuma1/7/2020easy and delicious recipe! I'll make it again at christmas for sure!AnonymousFrance12/15/2019We LOOOOOVE this recipe.  It is in heavy rotation in my house.  Even my husband that doesn\u2019t really do sweets thought This was amazing! I literally make it 4 times a month....eholmes80sColumbus, Ohio11/2/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titCarrotVegetableEasySideVegetarianGluten-FreeNut-FreeRoastRosh HashanahDinnerRecipes you want to make.
