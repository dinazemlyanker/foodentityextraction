And while much of that career has unfolded in Britain and America, there\u2019s a distinct Australian perspective embedded in his culinary style.Curtis Stone \u2013 Chef Owner of Maude & Gwen Butcher Shop & Restaurant\nRay Kachatorian\u201cThe way we as Aussies approach food is kind of unconventional,\u201d Stone says. \u201cOn the one hand, we\u2019re a young country. On the other hand, we have such old and deep roots\u201d\u2014with Australia\u2019s Aboriginal population as one of the oldest documented groups on earth.\u201cOn another level, there are multicultural elements to Australia, whether European or Southeast Asian\u2014ingredients and techniques used throughout our cuisine,\u201d he says. \u201cGrowing up in that environment certainly shapes you as a cook.\u201dAnd it\u2019s not just an international perspective; it\u2019s one that embraces the eclectic, the unpredictable, the rogue. According to Stone, \u201cThere\u2019s something around our sense of freedom and spirit that encourages change, encourages us to push and try for what\u2019s new and different.\u201d\u201cCompared with a Greek or Italian or Thai chef, an Aussie chef is harder to put a label on. But that can be a great thing.\u201dIt\u2019s hard to put a label on Stone\u2019s restaurants, as well. Maude, opened in February of 2014, presents intricate tasting menus inspired by the world\u2019s great wine regions; Gwen, opened in July of 2016, is equal parts butcher shop and restaurant, each driven by the joys of seasonal cookery.When Maude launched in Beverly Hills, Stone\u2019s series of monthly menus were based around individual ingredients. It fueled the kitchen\u2019s creativity for years. But after dozens of these menus, Stone was ready for a new challenge.\u201cWe always thought the wine pairings were a highlight,\u201d he says. \u201cSo as we really drilled down on those, we thought, \u2018What if we looked to wine regions for inspiration?\u2019\u201dCullen Wines -- An Australian winery based in Wilyabrup, within the Margaret River wine region of Western Australia.\nWine AustraliaAnd not simply to pair dishes with wines from a given region\u2014but rather to embrace everything about the culture. \u201cWhat if we study these places, and read up on them, but also learn the history, listen to the music, eat the food and drink the wine and just immerse ourselves?\u201dOf course, hailing from one of the world\u2019s great wine countries, Stone knew that the wines of Australia would play a part. So to compose the recent Western Australia menu, Stone led a mostly American team to the region.\u201cI had a lot of pride around it,\u201d says Stone, enamored of the beauty and diversity of the Western Australian landscape. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the dusty, smoky Outback and the Aboriginal ways of life, up in the Pilbara; the incredible beaches with crocodiles, then the Margaret River where it\u2019s so lush and beautiful\u2026 The entire region is stunning and unforgettable.\u201dStone felt a profound respect for the region\u2019s ambitious, at times experimental, winemakers. Cullen Wines was a particular standout. \u201cTheir process down there is biodynamic, and just incredible,\u201d he says, given the amount of attention this type of farming requires. \u201cSo much care and passion go into that method, when you\u2019re looking out for the earth in an extremely natural way.\u201dWhile wines were the backbone of the menu\u2019s inspiration, the team took the opportunity to really explore native foods, as well. \u201cWe met a few Aboriginal guys and did a deep dive into indigenous ingredients,\u201d Stone says, from wattleseed and bush tomatoes to mud crab and rock lobster. \u201cThere are so many of these ingredients that Western chefs are only beginning to appreciate.\u201dWattleseed, for instance, \u201chas a cacao-like, almost espresso-like flavor.\u201d Stone used it to encrust a venison loin, served with a celery root puree, roasted spaghetti squash, and venison jus. Davidson plum was another indigenous ingredient used \u2014\u201csuper acidic,\u201d according to Stone. He chose to dehydrate the plum for an accent on a not-quite-traditional tartare.\u201cThe Outback has incredibly flavorful beef,\u201d he explains, the dish largely inspired by a visit to a fifth-generation rancher at Yarrie Station in Western Australia. \u201cWe found that the best preparation for it was raw\u201d\u2014 that flavor emerging clearly in a tartare perked up by Davidson plum, with puffed rice and quinoa, smoked egg yolk, and fried capers.Yarrie Station in Western Australia\nPaul BellMore meat-centric fare is the focus of Gwen, Stone\u2019s other Hollywood restaurant opened with his brother, Luke \u2014inspired by his first job, \u201cand first love,\u201d in the butchery department at the Southern Cross Hotel in Melbourne. \u201cWe would cut whole animals, make charcuterie, all that old-school European stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s an art that\u2019s getting a bit lost.\u201dFire-based cooking fuels the menu here. And with beautiful cuts of meat, of course, wine is the logical companion. Stone\u2019s own passion for wine inspired much of Gwen\u2019s list\u2014perhaps a bit more literally than he might have liked.\u201cWhen we first opened the restaurant, the sommeliers were stealing from my personal stash of Australian wines,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThey\u2019ve stolen quite a lot and promise to replace them at some point, but it hasn\u2019t happened yet!\u201dStone has an enduring love for \u201cthose beautiful, big Barossa-style wines\u2014what Australia is known for,\u201d a gorgeous rich, peppery, Shiraz. Reds aren\u2019t the whole story: \u201cWe also make some truly elegant whites, some of which drink beautifully with a bit of age on them, too.\u201d He treasures punchily acidic Rieslings from the Clare Valley, or velvety Chardonnays from the Margaret River.Maude Wine Room Interior\nRAY KACHATORIANWith a great deal of respect for both venerable Australian wines and exciting newer upstarts, Stone sees a kinship between chefs and winemakers\u2014balancing the classic and the novel. \u201cAussie chefs aren\u2019t scared to break a rule here or there, and then see whether that could be successful for us,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd that applies in winemaking, as well.\u201dThe brilliance of Australian native winemakers, he says\u2014and, in many ways, Australian chefs\u2014is that while they\u2019re citizens of the world, they pursue their own paths. Winemakers have been able to learn from the world\u2019s other major wine regions, \"but they haven't just replicated those wines,\u201d Stone says. \u201cThey've figured out how to use the ingredients\u2014terroir, weather, and grapes\u2014to make wines that are unique and utterly unlike anywhere else in the world.\"Internationally influenced, with one eye toward tradition and another toward innovation\u2014the recipe not only for superb, unexpected wines, but for inspired cuisine as well.Recipes you want to make.
