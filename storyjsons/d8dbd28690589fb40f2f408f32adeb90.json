Using thick slices of Japanese milk bread, however, is a must. Its soft, fluffy interior soaks up the cream and fruit juices, but it won\u2019t turn to mush. There aren\u2019t many mass-produced milk breads out there, but you can find it at Asian markets as well as grocery stores that stock a good selection of Asian ingredients (or make your own!).IngredientsMakes 41cup chilled heavy cream1Tbsp. plus 2 tsp. sugarA pinch of kosher salt8slices Japanese milk bread1kiwi, peeled, cut crosswise into 4 \u00bd\"-thick rounds8small strawberries, trimmed, halved lengthwise1yellow peach or \u00bc mango, cut into 1\u00bd\"x\u00bd\" stripsPreparationStep 1Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat cream, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl until stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes. (You need it to be on the firm side. If cream is underwhipped, it will be more difficult to slice the sandwiches.)Step 2Neatly remove crusts from bread with a serrated knife. Arrange bread on a clean work surface. Evenly spread \u00bc cup whipped cream on each slice of bread with an offset spatula or butter knife. Place 1 kiwi round on top of whipped cream in the center of 4 bread slices. Arrange strawberry slices in corners of bread slices, orienting them so that the pointed end is tucked right into the corner. Place 4 peach strips in the gaps between kiwi and strawberries.Step 3Place a second slice of bread, cream side down, over to close sandwich. Smooth outside edges of whipped cream, adding a little if necessary to fill gaps. Wrap each sandwich in plastic wrap and chill at least 3 hours and up to 8.Step 4Using serrated knife, cut each sandwich into 4 triangles and serve.Photo by Alex LauHow would you rate Fruit Sandwiches?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkExplore Bon App\u00e9titSandwichFruit DessertDessertJapaneseEast AsianAsianKiwiFruitStrawberryBerryPeachStone FruitSummerEasySnackNut-FreeVegetarianMemorial DayLabor DayBreakfastLunchRecipes you want to make.
