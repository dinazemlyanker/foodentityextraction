And then, there\u2019s the refrigerator, the place you go to cure stress and boredom, and to stretch your legs and stomach.As a freelance writer who works from her apartment, I know all too well the siren call of the refrigerator: It beckons throughout the day, whether I\u2019m hungry or not. With recent estimates counting some 55 million U.S. freelance workers and a 2016 Gallup poll finding 43 percent of Americans work from home some of the time, I\u2019m confident I\u2019m not the only home worker who is caving to my cravings.\u201cWorking from home can be a serious luxury,\u201d admits Brigitte Zeitlin, M.P.H., R.D., owner of BZ Nutrition in New York City, \u201cbut it also comes with pitfalls, like making over-snacking all too easy.\u201d That\u2019s in part because, \u201cwork sometimes means you\u2019ll be stressed or bored\u2014and either of those emotions can make it hard to resist the call of the refrigerator,\u201d she explains.In writing these brief paragraphs, I\u2019ve walked to the fridge no fewer than three times, just to break up the monotony of sitting at my desk alone. But we who work from home don\u2019t have to be slaves to our refrigerators. We can break free of our chair-to-fridge cycles, Zeitlin says, and curb our constant cravings. Here\u2019s how.Set meal times.\u201cEating on a schedule will help you fight cravings and stay satisfied throughout the day,\u201d says Zeitlin. Plus, it will help you be mindful of whether you\u2019re eating \u201cbecause you\u2019re genuinely hungry, or because you\u2019re bored,\u201d she says. Start your day with a filling breakfast of protein and fiber\u2014think: a vegetable-egg scramble with a side of Greek yogurt and berries, plus a slice of whole-wheat toast topped with avocado mash. Then, commit to not eating lunch for three hours, Zeitlin says. Lunch can be followed by a snack another three hours later, and dinner three hours after that, she says.Drink water\u2014and a lot of it.According to Zeitlin, \u201cStaying well-hydrated throughout the day is a key defense against cravings.\u201d (And, she points out, at home \u201cthere\u2019s no issue with finding an open bathroom or passing the same coworker\u2019s desk for the tenth time.\u201d) Aim for eight to 10 glasses of water each day, though more is totally fine, too. Make it more appealing by adding a lemon or lime wedge, or swapping in sparkling for still.Take a break outside.You may value that fact that you don\u2019t have to leave home\u2014or the comfort of your couch\u2014to work. But not stepping outside \u201ccan easily contribute to a kitchen fog, because your only mobility is a path from your chair to the refrigerator,\u201d Zeitlin warns. So, \u201cget out of your home at least once during the day for a walk, a cup of coffee, or an errand,\u201d she encourages.Stock up on nutrient-dense snack foods.When the call of the refrigerator is too strong to resist, make sure it\u2019s stocked with foods you won\u2019t later regret eating. \u201cLook to stock snacks in your home that are nutrient-dense, such as edamame, hummus and baby carrots, a banana with nut butter, a cheese stick with whole grain crackers, or an apple with almonds,\u201d Zeitlin suggests. \u201cThese snacks combine protein and fiber, the two things that will help fill you up and keep you full and focused until your next designated meal time. If you have certain trigger foods that you can\u2019t stop yourself from eating,\u201d like potato chips or pretzels, \u201cthen do not keep them in the house.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishRead MorerestaurantsHow One Chef Broke Her Late-Night Eating HabitsBy Naomi PomeroyRecipes you want to make.
