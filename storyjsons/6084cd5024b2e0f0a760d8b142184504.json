Next up is Meherwan Irani, a chef and the founder of Brown in the South, a dinner series that aims to bridge the American South with South Asia.I had heard of Meherwan Irani as the chef-owner behind a bunch of beloved restaurants in the South: Chai Pani in Asheville and Decatur, Botiwalla in Atlanta, and Buxton Hall Barbecue, a BA 10 alum run by pitmaster Elliott Moss that\u2019s also in Asheville. Also as the founder of Spicewalla, the small-batch spice company we can\u2019t get enough of. But I honestly didn\u2019t know much about him until last summer, when I attended a dinner he was hosting called Brown in the South in Asheville. You can tell a lot about a person by the kind of party they throw.Irani\u2019s party involves playing plate Tetris with platters of craggy fried chicken inspired by goat karee, turmeric-tinged tomato hand pies, and pickled watermelon rinds. A Q&A with Irani and other participating chefs gently forces you to get to know your dining companions (in my case, a few middle-aged white couples and Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s!) beyond passing plates, as the conversation eased from small talk to group discussions about what it means to be a Southerner, to be brown in the South.Irani\u2019s party is warm and engaging, genuinely curious and experimental\u2014just like the chef himself. For just a few hours on one summer night, he got a lot of different people on the same page, reimagining the South not just as a hospitable place but an inclusive one. Who was this guy? I called up Irani to talk to him about the idea behind his dinner series (as well as the story behind the name), his family\u2019s history of cooking for pilgrims, and the universality of okra.Back in the 70s\u2026 everyone from The Beatles to foreigners from the U.S. and Europe came to India for the gurus. We had a very famous one in our small town of Ahmednagar, Meher Baba. So my grandma, being a good businesswoman, opened up a bed and breakfast for these pilgrims, and my mom became the manager of the household and the head cook.I grew up eating\u2026 pastas, casseroles, and Indian-style cutlets, which are meat patties held together with breadcrumbs and potato then pan-fried and served with a tomato gravy. My mom wanted to make our Western guests feel comfortable. Breakfast was very English: toast, eggs, porridge, which in India is barley and oats. We never knew what would be on the table for lunch and dinner each day. She could make potatoes taste like masala, with mustard seeds and fresh limes, or roast them with rosemary and olive oil. That was eye-opening for me as a kid. She applied Indian spices to dishes without changing the DNA of it.The first place I lived in the U.S\u2026 was the American South. Specifically Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. I didn\u2019t know anything about it before I came there for school, but I met Americans in India and saw them adapt pretty easily since my mom worked so hard to make our culture approachable to them. Our guru was all about service and that was built into our hospitality. I realized the South has this culture too: In chance encounters, people would invite me to their homes to feed me and take care of me.Soon I realized I just wanted to eat\u2026 homestyle food. I went to the local health food store and bought cumin and other Indian spices and tried to cook from memory. It was terrible. I knew what something was supposed to taste like but had no idea how to make it. I blundered along until my mom came to visit. She is a master of making do with whatever is on hand. If you don\u2019t have Indian spinach, you can use collards. Or if you don\u2019t have coriander, try thyme or marjoram. She had done this her whole life.When I decided to open Chai Pani\u2026 we didn\u2019t spend a lot of time thinking about using very Southern ingredients to make Indian street food. The idea came naturally. I started thinking more about this when I went to the Southern Foodways Alliance symposium a couple years ago and started talking to Vish Bhatt [the chef of Snackbar]. Vish is in Mississippi, where Emmett Till was murdered so many years back and at the core of the civil rights movement. I was like, \u201cWhat\u2019s it like, Vish?\u201d He said, \u201cI have to constantly remind people I\u2019m Southern.\u201d He\u2019s been here all his life. He cooks Southern food. But when he gets asked to write a recipe, it\u2019s always Indian even though he can probably make better shrimp and grits than anyone else.How long do you have to be somewhere\u2026 before you dispense with the disclaimers that you\u2019re from somewhere else? Especially in the South, where there is a complicated history? I realized I was a Southerner the moment I said it. I had to own [the term] in order to approach the rest of the chefs I wanted to reach out to for this dinner. I told my wife, \u201cI\u2019m going to call myself a Southerner who happens to be of Indian origin, instead of saying, I\u2019m an Indian who happens to be living in the South.\u201d I may not look like a Southerner, but by living and embracing it, I\u2019m hoping to change people\u2019s perception of it.Food is a great way\u2026 to show that \u201cother\u201d isn\u2019t so other.There\u2019s okra in India! In the Deccan Plateau, it barely rains and we, too, have to deal with leafy, fibrous greens. Ham hock is added to collards for flavor [in the South]\u2014we\u2019ve got cumin over there. Chow chow adds some zing to a meal with rice and beans. Well, that mango pickle is doing the same thing, giving flavor to fairly bland meals of rice and dal. Those commonalities are so much more approachable than anything else I could talk about.We came up with the name Brown in the South... when my team was joking around, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re brown and we\u2019re Southern, dammit!!\u201d And we were like, \u201cOkay, Brown in the South. What does that mean?\u201d Fried chicken but fried in coconut oil and a hint of garam masala, like how Asha [Gomez] makes it. It\u2019s shrimp and grits upma style. Tomato pie. Butternut squash soup with ginger and cinnamon.We invited everyone we could\u2026 and 130 people showed up. Chefs flew in. Magazine writers came. We had a remarkable conversation. John T. Edge did the opening talk and in it he said that he\u2019s a passive Southerner. He was born here and that\u2019s all he knows what to be and do. But he defined us new Southerners as active Southerners. Instead of inheriting this identity, we\u2019re forced to take on this identity and, by doing that, we\u2019re mending the South. We\u2019ve been running with that ever since.We decided to take the dinner on the road\u2026. after we all spoke about what it means for us to be living in the American South and how we wanted to raise our hands and be counted as Southerners, too. All around the dining room, people of every color were talking about how the South can be one of the most diverse, progressive thinking parts of the country and what role we play in getting there.I\u2019m hoping the next one will be in\u2026 Oxford, Mississippi. We\u2019re trying to reach out to immigrant chefs in the deep South who have never thought of themselves as Southerners because of what it means to sound like a Southerner or look like one. I\u2019m asking myself: Can the community and region we\u2019re in be better because Brown in the South happened? There is no easy answer, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m working on for the next year.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishPerson of InterestNorth CarolinaInterviewsRead MoreLifestyleWe'd Get on a Plane to PDX for Dana Frank's New Natural Wine FairBy Lizzie NoonanRecipes you want to make.
