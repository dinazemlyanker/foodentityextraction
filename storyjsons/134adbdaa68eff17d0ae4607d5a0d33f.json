She doesn\u2019t eat whey or soy protein. But insect protein was Whole30-friendly. (The program emphasizes unprocessed foods and vegetables, but doesn\u2019t discourage meat consumption.) Crickets are a complete protein source: Crickets offer comparable\u2014or better\u2014amounts of protein, vitamin B12, and iron than other meat, according to recent research.While insects are consumed in most countries worldwide and have been for millennia, they\u2019ve only started making their way into packaged foods in the Western world in the last decade. Chapul, the company that sells Hartwig\u2019s favorite bars, was founded by a former whitewater-rafting guide, Pat Crowley, in 2012 and was featured on \u201cShark Tank\u201d in 2014. Chapul also makes cricket protein powders in three flavors, which Hartwig will mix with water and bring with her when she\u2019s on the go or hiking in the mountains near her home in Salt Lake City.Technically, because of grain-based additives, the chocolate and vanilla-flavored powders and protein bars aren\u2019t Whole30-compliant. Hartwig explains that she bends the diet\u2019s rules a bit\u2014it\u2019s only designed to last a month, after all\u2014but if you\u2019re being strict, the plain powder, which consists solely of Chapul cricket flour, is totally above board.Hartwig has gotten to know Crowley, Chapul\u2019s founder, who speaks passionately about the environmental reasons to get behind insect protein. As he explains in one of his TEDx talks, a protein bar was the easiest way to ease skeptical Western consumers into the idea of eating insects.\u201cIt\u2019s very recognizable to our culture [as] food,\u201d he says of the bar format. \u201cSo it\u2019s designed to not only be a gentle introduction, but be a wrecking ball to that cultural bias.\u201dAnd, no, cricket protein doesn\u2019t taste like bugs. \u201cThey made it very accessible,\u201d Hartwig said. She likes to offer friends a protein shake, only revealing afterwards that it was made with cricket powder. Though she swears by Chapul\u2019s products, Hartwig says she\u2019ll happily try other insect-based foods. \u201cJust maybe not any live ones,\u201d she says.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishTrendsRead MorecultureWhy I'm Eating 90 Grams of Protein a DayBy Adriana VelezRecipes you want to make.
