In the future, I'd lean more towards a vinegar dressing for the salad, with a tahini base [without yogurt]. but some great components!Anonymous1/31/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titDinnerLunchEasySaladVegetarianNut-FreeGluten-FreeHealthyishAsian PearFruitQuinoaRice & GrainsYogurtOther IngredientsSideWinterRecipes you want to make.
