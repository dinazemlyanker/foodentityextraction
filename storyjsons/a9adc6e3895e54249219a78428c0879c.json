Maybe it\u2019s because of the intensely hyper local sourcing of the ingredients. Or maybe it\u2019s because the flaky texture reminds them of the pride of the ATL: wings! But one thing is certain: This is a taco that bridges both the flavors of Mexico and the South.Inside the wonderful world that is 8arm\nPhoto by Kevin BrownThe MushroomsFor this dish, Vega draws inspiration from the family fish fries her Uncle Jose hosted in Guanajuato. But while he hauled coolers full of shrimp and oysters, Vega goes vegetarian with fat oyster mushrooms from Qihe Mushroom Farm in Newnan, Georgia. She dunks the shrooms in aji-pepper-spiked coconut milk before dredging them in locally milled cornmeal\u2014a sweet blue variety from South Carolina\u2019s Anson Mills or vibrant red bollito from Buckeye Creek Farm just north of Atlanta\u2014then fries them till they crackle.The RajasThis year, Vega was blessed (or cursed) with a surplus of aji peppers, as in 250 pounds of them. That\u2019s the nature of working with local farms, but she isn\u2019t complaining. She\u2019s turning them into rajas, a chile-based condiment that \u201chits you immediately, like a jab.\u201d To make it, she starts with acid\u2014maybe leftover chamomile vinegar or apple cider vinegar with a bit of lime juice\u2014then layers sliced garlic and onion, salted and dried aji, and Greek oregano, hotter and earthier than the Mexican kind. The result is spicy, tangy\u2014and gone within a few days.The FrijolesVega tried black beans for the requisite frijoles, but they didn\u2019t compare to Anson Mills\u2019s nutty, creamy Sea Island red peas. One of her old chefs introduced her to the Low Country gem\u2014a staple in Hoppin\u2019 Johns and Gullah \u201creezy peezy\u201d\u2014and since then she\u2019s been cooking them down with aji, onions, preserved tomatoes, and her mom\u2019s smoky chile negros for a guisado-style mash. \u201cIt makes this taco feel Southern,\u201d she says, \u201cwithout compromising.\u201dThe SalsaWhen tomato season\u2019s long gone, Vega conjures up chile tamulado, a Yucatan-style salsa of charred habaneros, garlic, and sour orange juice that gets its name from the Mayan word for mortar and pestle. She roasts habaneros from Mena\u2019s Farm on Atlanta\u2019s Westside, then blends them with local garlic and citrus. Finished with a little salt, the salsa is so sweet and smoky that you won\u2019t miss the tomatoes.The TortillaFifty percent Oaxacan yellow corn, 50 percent Georgian yellow corn\u2014that\u2019s the masa blend Vega works with for her lithe tortillas. She picks it up from Minero, chef Sean Brock\u2019s Mexican spot across the street, and mixes it with a little water to shape the tortillas so they\u2019re pliable, not crumbly, and hefty enough to support sauce. \u201cThe salsa and rajas release liquid, so the tortilla needs to be thick, like a folder,\u201d Vega says. Once flattened in her tortilla press, she cooks the tortillas in a hot cast-iron pan\u2014no oil, just pure sweet corn flavor.The ToppingsTo balance out all the smoky, spicy, and fermented flavors, Vega crowns her taco with what she calls \u201cpalate cleansers\u201d: thin rounds of crunchy Easter radishes, intensely grassy cilantro from local urban farming collective Grow Where You Are, and ribbons of raw kale. \u201cIs it still in fashion? I\u2019m not sure!\u201d she jokes. \u201cBut it\u2019s a good winter green that adds a bit of freshness.\u201dChef Maricela Vega\nPhoto by Ryan FleisherWant More Stories From Taco Nation?
