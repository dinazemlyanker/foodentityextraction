Gamechanger? Bring your skillet out to the grill, place it on top of a hot zone, and you can grill and saute your veggies side by side. Well-seasoned or enameled cast iron will hold up to the fire and retain heat at high temperatures, making it the perfect place for blistering spiced tomatoes without losing any of their flavorful juices. \u2014Rachel GurjarAll products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I've made this twice now and love it both times. I added cauliflower as one of the veggies to get some crunch and it made it even better. Also cooked up a little more tomatoes so it's more saucey. Overall, a super easy and tasty dish.JeffLos Angeles12/12/2021Made this easy flavorful recipe on the stove and oven and it was delicious!!! Super quick and super saucy.
