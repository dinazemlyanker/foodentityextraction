The best chocolates\u2014from lacquered, hand-painted bonbons to single-origin, small batch bars\u2014are a mere click away.The BarsjcocoThis Seattle chocolatier made me question my commitment to dark chocolate. I did not expect mango plantain milk chocolate (flecked with crunchy bits of plantain chips) and cayenne Veracruz orange white chocolate (salty with just the right amount of heat) to be my favorites in its 10-bar sampler set, but here we are! Every day an opportunity for growth! For every three ounces of chocolate sold, jcoco donates the cost of a meal to partner food banks in Washington, California, and New York, so do a good deed and buy in bulk.Buy it at jcocoPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food styling by Pearl JonesTony\u2019s ChocolonelyDutch chocolate brand Tony\u2019s Chocolonely is something of a contradiction. On the one hand, its zany 1960s circus packaging screams \u201cHey, our brand is wacky!\u201d On the other, its mission is dead serious: ending child labor and slavery in the chocolate supply chain. At a whopping 6.35 ounces, the bars are enormous compared to most of the others on this list. I chopped up its milk caramel sea salt bar and folded it into Claire Saffitz\u2019s Malted \u201cForever\u201d Brownies (a very good idea) and hid its dark milk pretzel toffee bar from my partner (I apologize, Margaret).\u00a0Buy it at Amazon or Thrive MarketRaakaMost chocolate is made by roasting fermented cacao beans, but Raaka\u2019s single-origin bars are entirely unroasted. This makes for a brighter, fruitier chocolate\u2014think about the difference between a lightly roasted coffee and dark French roast\u2014that lets the raw ingredients shine.Buy it at Amazon or Food52Madhu ChocolateThis Austin bean-to-bar company mashes up Colombian chocolate with South Asian flavors like vanilla fennel, saffron milk, and masala chai.Buy it at Madhu ChocolateOmnom ChocolateEach offering from this Icelandic bean-to-bar company comes wrapped in paper patterned with a different animal\u2014unicorns for the Caramel + Milk, swans for the Lakkr\u00eds + Raspberry (a licorice lover\u2019s dream), and aggro crows for the charcoal-hued Black N\u2019 Burnt Barley, which tastes like boricha and is every bit as metal as it sounds.Buy it at AmazonAlter EcoAlter Eco\u2019s chocolate is good\u2014you\u2019ll find its Brown Butter bars stashed all around my house\u2014but its commitment to sustainable farming practices is what makes this my go-to grocery store choice. Its recently launched foundation is helping cacao cooperatives in Ecuador and the Dominican Republic transition to a system of regenerative agroforestry, so that farming can be part of a diverse forest ecosystem rather than driving its destruction.Buy it at Amazon or Thrive MarketCasa Bosques\u2019 hoja santa bar, a collaboration with chef Elena Reygadas\nCasa Bosques ChocolatesOnce you see the packaging on Casa Bosques single-origin bars, it will come as no surprise that founder Rafael Prieto\u2019s day job is running a design studio. The core collection includes collaborations with Mexican culinary luminaries like Elena Reygadas and Enrique Olvera, and upcoming flavors from its limited-edition Laboratorio series include Parmigiano-Reggiano and castile flower with pistachio.Buy it at Casa Bosques ChocolatesThe Bonbons and TrufflesFormosa ChocolatesOakland-based psychiatrist turned chocolatier Kimberly Yang crafts artful, brightly colored bonbons that are almost too pretty to eat. The blood orange speculoos truffle features layers of citrusy ganache and hazelnut pralin\u00e9 studded with those buttery spiced cookies you get when you fly Delta. The coffee caramel, which looks like a cappuccino cup for dolls, has a perfectly bitter edge thanks to Taiwanese coffee and sugar that\u2019s just on this side of burnt.Buy it at Etsy or Formosa ChocolatesLa Maison du ChocolatIt doesn\u2019t get classier than La Maison du Chocolat, whose ganaches, pralin\u00e9s, and truffles have been handcrafted on the outskirts of Paris since 1977.\u00a0Buy it at Food52 or Saks Fifth AvenueMidunu ChocolatesGhana-born, New York\u2013raised Selassie Atadika lived in 41 African countries during her time working for UNICEF as a child protection officer and emergency specialist. Now, she\u2019s paying tribute to the diverse flavors of the continent through her truffles, which come in flavors like Cape Malay curry, Ethiopian berbere, and Moroccan mint tea and are made from single-origin Ghanian cacao by an all-female team of chocolatiers.Buy it at Midunu ChocolatesDelysia ChocolatierIn the hands of someone less skilled, green chili queso or chicken fried steak truffles would be gimmicky at best and downright disgusting at worst. But Austin chocolatier Nicole Patel manages to pull it off, concocting savory-sweet truffles that are more than just novelty. Her Taste of the South collection includes both more traditional options like mint julep and banana pudding as well as a Frito pie truffle, which features a corn chip center and a cheese, chive, and ghost pepper ganache that did not come to play.Buy it at Delysia ChocolatierVesta ChocolateNew Jersey\u2013based spouses Roger Rodriguez and Julia Choi Rodriguez create single-origin bars, vegan barks, and \u201cfunctional\u201d white chocolate bars made with superfoods and antioxidant-rich ingredients like Diaspora Co. turmeric. But the bonbons, which might include flavors like milk and honey, salted caramel, and spiced maca, are really where it\u2019s at.Buy it at Vesta ChocolateStick With Me Sweets\u2019 box of 24 bonbons, all of them mine\nPhoto by Evan SungStick With Me SweetsThese are the chocolates that haunt my dreams. Everything that Susanna Yoon and her team make is exquisite, from the shiny, jewel-like bonbons to the Betterfinger bars which, unlike Bart Simpson\u2019s candy bar of choice, don\u2019t get stuck in your teeth. The bonbon collections come disguised in a box that looks like a book\u2014handy if you decide you\u2019re not in a sharing mood.Buy it at Stick With Me SweetsExquisito ChocolatesWhile many of Carolina Quijano\u2019s single-origin chocolate bars are simple by design, made with only cacao and unrefined cane sugar to highlight the chocolate\u2019s terroir, her bonbons and barks nod to the company\u2019s home in Miami\u2019s Little Havana, incorporating flavors like plantain and locally grown guava. There are also, crucially, chocolate-coated potato chips.Buy it at Exquisito ChocolatesThe OthersPure Chocolate by JinjiChocolatier and nutritional health counselor may not seem like professions that go hand in hand, but Baltimore-based Jinji Fraser has carved out an extremely delicious niche. Her confections may be free of dairy, gluten, and refined sugar, but you won\u2019t miss them. The chocolate-covered, peanut butter ganache\u2013filled Turkish figs are absolute mad genius sorcery.Buy it at Pure Chocolate by JinjiAndr\u00e9\u2019s Confiserie SuisseThis third-generation, family-run confectioner in Kansas City, Missouri, makes \u201cold people\u201d chocolates, and I mean that in the best possible way. The chocolate-enrobed orange peels, roasted almonds, and marzipan sticks are absolute classics that need no improvement.Buy it at Andr\u00e9\u2019s Confiserie SuisseChe Fico GiandujaSan Francisco\u2019s Che Fico (one of BA\u2019s top 10 restaurants of 2018) does wonderful things with chocolate\u2014like this chocolate budino with candied walnuts that we lost our minds over. But if you don\u2019t want to bust out the Silpat and make caramel, Che Fico\u2019s gianduja is the instant chocolate fix you need. What is it? Nutella, more or less, but made with really good chocolate from Guittard and no palm oil. Spread it on toast slicked with salted butter, fold it into homemade Rice Krispies Treats, or, if you are me, eat it right off the spoon.Buy it at Che Fico AlimentariExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingValentines DayRecipes you want to make.
