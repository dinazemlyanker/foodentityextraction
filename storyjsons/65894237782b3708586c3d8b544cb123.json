Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you\u2019ll get the scoop before everyone else.Dear Healthyish friends,From late October to early April, one piece of cookware takes up permanent residence on my stovetop, quietly burbling up hot pots and soups on cold nights. People message me on Instagram whenever I post photos of my donabe: What is it? (A Japanese earthenware pot used for cooking and serving.) Where did I get it? (Toiro Kitchen in L.A.) What do I make in it? (Everything!)At a basic level, a donabe is a pot that just happens to be pretty enough to double as a striking serving piece. High-quality versions have thick walls that effectively retain heat and are especially good for gently cooking the vegetable-heavy meals I want constantly this time of year.When I\u2019m short on time, I opt for a quick nabe, or hot pot, which starts with a light broth that I season with good soy sauce and mirin. My broth of choice is often dashi, an essential Japanese stock of dried bonito flakes, kombu, and water that gives dishes like miso soup their subtle briny flavor. When I need dinner to be even more hands-off, I\u2019ll make a vegan mushroom dashi by placing dried shiitakes and a strip of kombu in a big jar of water and refrigerating it all overnight. The resulting golden broth is savory and lightly earthy. It lacks the body of a lipsmacking chicken stock, which is exactly why I like it: A bowlful leaves me feeling satisfied but not weighed down.Photo by Emma Fishman, Food Styling by Rebecca Jurkevich\u00a0When warmed in the donabe, the dashi creates a small hot tub environment for whatever kitchen-sink assortment of vegetables and protein I\u2019m cooking. Some days I may have peeled, seeded, and sliced kabocha or butternut squash already prepped and ready to drop into the simmering broth. While the thick squash starts cooking away, I\u2019ll quickly tear greens and mushrooms, slice tofu, and boil a little pot of noodles like soba to slip in right before I\u2019m ready to eat. In those few minutes I enter an almost flow-like state, moving seamlessly from cutting board to stove; dinner is ready in minutes.Though this recipe is a nabe I make often, it\u2019s meant to be a guideline not scripture. That\u2019s the beauty of this style of cooking: Each rendition is slightly different from the one before. But no matter how much you mix it up, you\u2019re guaranteed a meal that\u2019s vibrant and delicious, nourishing yet light, and that leaves you feeling good inside. If there\u2019s one thing I want you to take away from this, it\u2019s that you can absolutely riff without a recipe. And that you should have a donabe of your own, of course.May your weekend be broth-filled,Christina ChaeyAssociate editorMake the recipe:Fridge Clean-Out Nabe With Mushroom DashiChristina Chaey\u2019s mushroom dashi can go with whatever vegetables and proteins you have in the fridge.
