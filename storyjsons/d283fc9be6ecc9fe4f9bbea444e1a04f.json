(Hint: The answer involves bread and cheese.) In her new column, the author explains.By Deb PerelmanOctober 25, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Molly BazFacebookTwitterEmailSometimes I think that people are on to me when I talk up a new recipe I made for dinner.\u201cBut did your kids eat that?\u201d\n\u201cNo, did they really?\u201d\n\u201cEven the toddler, Deb?\u201dAnd then I have to mumble the truth, which is that the toddler wasn\u2019t hungry because she had already eaten three raspberries and a Cheerio.I\u2019m exaggerating, but only a little. I have two kids. My nine-year-old son, Jacob, is the easy one. He\u2019s a pretty normal fourth-grader, which is to say he\u2019d still choose pizza, tacos, or spaghetti over most other things (who wouldn\u2019t?). But he\u2019s curious enough, so my husband and I can often talk him into trying new dishes, like, without bribery.Then there\u2019s my daughter, Anna. She\u2019s three and she is, frankly, the child I had coming after years of cooking whatever I wanted and having everyone go along with it. She likes...I wish I could tell you. There was the time she demolished a lamb chop. She ate a stuffed pasta shell last week, once she\u2019d scraped off the sauce and emptied the shell of its contents. And that wasn\u2019t even a bad Tuesday night. She\u2019s immune to reason, to negotiating, to begging. But I\u2019m about to tell you something that sends shock waves through parent friends and will absolutely result in a phone call from my mother-in-law when she reads this:I won\u2019t go back to the kitchen and make another meal if my kids don\u2019t like what I\u2019ve cooked.Illustration by Jordan AwanI don\u2019t aspire to unlock the Meanest, Most Terrible Mom Ever badge for refusing to be a short-order cook or to turn dinner into a battle of wills. I take this stance because I love cooking and want to protect this love by not burning out from preparing three dinners a night.What I do instead sounds radical but shouldn\u2019t be: I cook what I crave, then tweak as needed to convince the kids to come along for the ride. I try to limit the number of ingredients I suspect they\u2019re going to push back against to one\u2014two, tops\u2014per meal, because there\u2019s no worse feeling than coming to the table and seeing nothing that you like to eat. I\u2019d rather try to sell them on something I\u2019m really excited about because I know it\u2019s delicious than wear myself out making food that so zaps my cooking joy that I don\u2019t want to make dinner again until they\u2019re in college.This strata\u2014essentially a savory bread pudding\u2014was a recent success. Whenever I can, I like to treat meat as an accessory rather than the centerpiece. But kids are not renowned for their enthusiastic consumption of heaps of vegetables, so I home in on the ones I know they like. When all else fails, I blanket everything in melted cheese. I try to use more nutritional breads, like a whole wheat sourdough, and a greater portion of vegetables (there\u2019s over a pound of greens and leeks in here) than anything else. The eggs provide protein, the cheese creates an irresistible bronzed lid, and the entire thing makes phenomenal leftovers reheated in the oven, which feels like winning the lottery.My daughter ate five whole bites of this before she realized what she\u2019d done and shoved the rest away. This, my friends, is what we consider a home run.Get the recipe:Cheesy Kale and Mushroom StrataHere's how to convince kids to eat mushrooms and kale for dinner.View RecipeDeb Perelman is the author of two best-selling cookbooks inspired by her beloved blog, Smitten Kitchen.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCooking For KidsWeeknightPicky Eaters\u2019 ClubRead MorecultureThe Smitten Kitchen Is Back, and the Kitchen\u2019s Still TinyBy Alex BeggsCreamy Tomato Soup with Cheese ToastiescookingThe Chicken Katsu Recipe Every Kid (and Adult) Will LoveBy Adam RapoportRecipes you want to make.
