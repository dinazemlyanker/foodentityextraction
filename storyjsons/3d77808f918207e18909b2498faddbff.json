Then there are the foods they ask for (a \u201cshandwich\u201d the same child requested for lunch) only to flat-out decline moments later (\u201cI no like shandwiches\u201d). We joke about how impossible it is that we could create a human being who doesn\u2019t like hot dogs or tater tots, but I would like for the sake of this story to boldly go where I don\u2019t think enough essays about feeding kids have gone before: I want to own my children\u2019s pickiness.Guys, I was a picky eater as a kid. I didn\u2019t like meat. I didn\u2019t like cooked green vegetables. I didn\u2019t like eggs. I didn\u2019t understand the purpose of cheese on things that weren\u2019t, say, pizza. I\u2019ve come around to all of those and then some; for me, learning to cook things the way I wanted really helped, but mostly I just grew out of it. Perhaps my kids will too.Of course, the idea that they might one day love the dinner they\u2019re currently despondent over is little consolation when I\u2019m wiped out on a Tuesday night. We all need a simple, efficient meal but have different ideas about what constitutes one.Before I had kids, I often turned canned beans into dinner by tossing them with pasta, making a quick soup or salad, or schmearing them on toast with a fried egg. I could still turn them into almost anything... if my kids would let me. But like their picky mom before them, they haven\u2019t taken to beans outside of chili, and even then, hesitantly. We even ended up taking them out of the mix entirely for a while.The biggest breakthrough we\u2019ve had in bean consumption was when I began treating them like pasta. A couple of years ago, I made a baked ziti\u2013like dish in which I used jumbo white beans instead of pasta, cook- ing them in a vegetable-flecked marinara sauce, top- ping with mozzarella and Parmesan, and broiling until brown and bubbly. The kids were skeptical until I called them \u201cpizza beans\u201d\u2014and lo, somehow this was the trick that finally got them to eat legumes for dinner.Illustration by Giacomo GambineriBut for nights when we\u2019re short on time, I like to take the best parts of the pizza beans\u2014white beans, tomato sauce, greens, and garlic\u2014and give them a speedier English-style beans-on-toast treatment.A friend from the UK introduced me to this dorm-friendly delight in college. The \u201crecipe\u201d: Warm a can of baked beans and ladle over buttered toast. If you\u2019re feeling extra, you can finish it with cheese.For this weeknight-friendly toast, I make a one-skillet ragu\u0300 with crumbled sausage, wilted greens, lots of garlic, as many red pepper flakes as we can pull off, and then canned white beans where we might other- wise add pasta. For the toast, I use slices of buttery garlic bread (the ultimate kid bait), and we finish it with Parmesan (because we are always feeling extra). It\u2019s a bit more elaborate than the version I learned in college\u2014it takes 25 minutes, not five\u2014but it\u2019s also a more rounded meal. It\u2019s become such a hit that it\u2019s gone into our permanent rotation\u2014and I get to check another ingredient off the Never Feed Us This list. I call that a triumph.Get the recipe:Weeknight Beans on ToastThis recipe will make more rag\u00f9 than you need, but the leftovers can be repurposed as a quick topper for pasta on another night.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titWhite BeanRaguToastPicky Eaters\u2019 ClubRead MorecookingA Cheesy, Bready Dinner to Please the Pickiest Eaters in Your HouseholdBy Deb PerelmanRecipes you want to make.
