This recipe is so good (and so simple!), I don't need to go the restaurant any time soon. (Though let\u2019s be clear: I still want to.)Is Molly Baz a Palizzi Social Club member?!Stuffed shells, according to chef-owner Joey Baldino, are one of those \u201clost and forgotten old-school Italian-American dishes\u201d\u2014the kind of comfort food that appeared in the buffet spreads at the baptisms, weddings, and funerals held at the club when it first opened nearly a century ago. Baldino keeps his rendition as true to the original recipe as he can: nothing too complicated, with fresh tomato sauce and a ricotta-mozzarella filling.Now, I took a couple of, um, liberties here. First, my giant shells weren\u2019t all that big (they were jumbo shells in the \u201cjumbo shrimp\u201d sense of the word, meaning they were still quite small). Second, I skipped the recommended marinara for an Instant Pot version so that I could avoid any stirring whatsoever. (If you, too, are going it on your own with the sauce, a warning: I made the mistake of adding too much carrot, which made the sauce sweeter than I would have liked. Learn from my error!) Third, I did not have enough ricotta, so I used some roasted garlic-ricotta that I had leftover from making the new Broccoli and Garlic-Ricotta Toasts along with some heavy cream. And, lastly, I added lots of fresh basil (you can\u2019t sleep on that stuff\u2014it wilts if you avert your eyes even for a second), both to the filling and as garnish.The interior of Palizzi, which you may never see in person.\nPhoto by Alex LauShould I be ashamed of my deviation? It all worked out in the end: four of us nearly finished the whole \u201cserves 8\u201d recipe. Plus, Baldino told me that \u201cif you're cooking with high-quality ingredients, taking your time, and putting in some love, it's going to turn out really well.\u201d And he was right! (But also, make sure your filling is well-seasoned with salt and pepper.)So, yes, try to find a friend with a PSC membership so that you can eat the real thing, straight from Baldino himself. But if you have no member-friends (or no friends at all...), don\u2019t be sad: Make these at home and it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re there.Get the recipe:Stuffed Shells with MarinaraRemember: If the shells are perfectly cooked in the first step, they\u2019ll be mushy and flabby after baking.
