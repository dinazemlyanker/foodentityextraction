Let\u2019s ask an expert.By Alex BeggsApril 25, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie CraigFacebookTwitterEmailEvery Friday morning, Bon App\u00e9tit senior staff writer Alex Beggs shares weekly highlights from the BA offices, from awesome new recipes to office drama to restaurant recs, with some weird (food!) stuff she saw on the internet thrown in. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Shake it\u201cStop what you\u2019re doing,\u201d I was told, \u201cand watch Stanley Tucci making cocktails.\u201d I put down the French murder mystery I was reading (the investigator sleeps in, drives slow, and has a pet toad named Bufo), and glued my eyes to the Tooch\u2019s biceps as he shook a Negroni and poured it into a delicate, expensive-looking coupe glass. \u201cDoesn\u2019t sound like enough ice,\u201d noted Christina Chaey. I wonder what other details I missed. \u201cHe pronounced Milanese beautifully,\u201d pointed out drinks columnist Al Culliton, \u201cand he\u2019s using the best gin and vermouth money can buy: Plymouth and Carpano Antica.\u201d There was some hubbub on the Internet about shaking a negroni, which is usually stirred because it is an all-spirit cocktail and shaking dilutes the booze, Al told me, adding: \u201cThat said, he\u2019s shaking much more gently than I would, so maybe it's not so bad?\u201dAh, the gentle shake.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!CrowdsourcingOn the theme of...drinking... I asked our beloved Test Kitchen editors what their isolation cocktail has been this week (alcohol optional):Molly Baz has been mixing up \u201cYUMMY JOOS,\u201d \u201ca cocktail I invented two weeks ago and simply cannot shake.\u201d Well, actually it is shaken. It\u2019s an unmeasured combination of mezcal, Aperol, lemon juice, simple syrup, and a pinch of salt. Shake, serve on the rocks with a salted rim.Rick Martinez makes a sleepytime soda that\u2019s half chamomile, half hibiscus tea, with agave and a splash of Topo Chico\u2014over ice.Chris Morocco\u2019s having a large glass of red wine.Priya Krishna is on the Topo train too: \u201cMy mom made a pretty amazing lemonade with Meyer lemon juice, sugar, salt (salt!!), ice, and Topo Chico.\u201dClaire Saffitz hasn\u2019t been boozing that much, but when she does, she\u2019s having \u201ca Lillet over ice with a very big wedge of lemon.\u201d Classy, Claire!Brad Leone didn\u2019t reply to my email. But then again, he\u2019s not really \u201can email guy.\u201dAndy Baraghani prefers a glass of tequila with a fat ice cube.Sohla El-Waylly is \u201creally into this lavender booch that I'll even pour into a glass over ice like a fancy person\u2014tastes like spring.\u201dChristina Chaey just opened a bottle of BORDIGA VERMOUTH BIANCO, ALL-CAPS HERS, which she drinks \u201cin a rocks glass with a big ice cube, splash o\u2019 sody water, and lemon twist. Delightful.\u201dCarla Lalli Music \u201ccrushed several margaritas last night,\u201d she confessed, and has been enjoying \u201cquite a few Cynar spritzes\u20141.5 oz cynar, 1/2 oz red vermouth, lots of ice, top with club soda.\u201dTed CavanaughMy drink of the weekAfter I made BA\u2019s Best Chocolate Chip Cookies, I had leftover egg whites, which meant I could make one of my favorite cocktails ever, the Rattlesnake. It\u2019s frothy and lemony. Make it! What else ya gonna do.Read more: This Cocktail Is Called the Rattlesnake, and That\u2019s Reason Enough to Make ItPhoto by Alexandra AyersIn other newsPUZZLES.What I can\u2019t wrap my mind aroundThe last restaurant meal I had before sheltering-in-place was at Charlie Bird in New York. I squinted at the bill sideways, but I knew it was worth it. I ran into Carla there, actually. We HUGGED and it felt so wrong. I\u2019m having trouble conceiving of a world without these neighborhood restaurants. Please don\u2019t tell me they\u2019ll all be replaced with Ruth\u2019s Chris steak houses. Gabrielle Hamilton\u2019s recent piece in the Times magazine about closing her restaurant Prune reads like a heartbreaking, dreaded epilogue to Blood, Bones, and Butter. The chapter I never wanted to read.We\u2019ve been trying to boost awareness and raise funds for restaurant workers in need right now\u2014a Sisyphean task, it can feel like\u2014by showing chefs cooking at home on Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s Instagram Stories. This week, Eric Sze of 886 made scallion pancakes (watch it here) that he then turned into a scallion pancake BREAKFAST BURRITO. With a side of white wine. Need! Want! It was mesmerizing, sizzling fun. Over 100 donations came in, Eric said\u2014a week\u2019s worth of pay for his staff.I ordered a 6-pack of somm-favorite wine (ships nationwide, phewph) from Parcelle, which donates profits to ROAR. Here are even more ways you can show restaurants love right now. Hopefully the actual dang GOVERNMENT will do the bulk of the work needed to save them, though.Unnecessary TikTok of the weekDid I just watch asparagus get sorted by size?Unnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekA question was thrown into the void by Chaey: \u201cDoes anyone have a favorite biscotti recipe?\u201d Meryl Rothstein did the work-from-home equivalent of interrupting: \u201cDoes anyone LIKE biscotti?\u201d How could she!? I love dipping an almond biscotti into my coffee, letting it dissolve into soft pebbles I\u2019ll forget about until they try and choke me on the last sip. I need that kind of beverage excitement! Sohla\u2019s with me\u2013loves it. Chaey \u201cloves a hard cookie.\u201d \u201cONLY with espresso or coffee,\u201d said Andy. \u201cI\u2019ll just leave this here,\u201d Carla said, uploading a Google doc with her new mocha hazelnut biscotti recipe (wait for that cookbook!). Both Chaey and Sohla turned around and baked it: \u201cIt was molto delizioso,\u201d said Chaey. Cristina Martinez needed that recipe, she\u2019d been on a two-day quest for a good biscotti recipe (gotta have something to quest about these days). Chris Morocco came in with a take as neutral as Switzerland: \u201cIt\u2019s the antithesis of what I normally like in a cookie: it\u2019s all one texture. Yet a good one, crisp, nutty, sweet and toasty, is pretty glorious.\u201d Then the cranks showed up. \u201cI DON\u2019T LIKE IT,\u201d Rachel Karten shouted. \u201cThey\u2019re barely cookies!\u201d complained MacKenzie Fegan. \u201cIt\u2019s just stale bread,\u201d huffed Hilary Cadigan. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather eat a cookie that doesn't depend on being dunked?\u201d posed Meryl. \u201cI prefer mandel bread?\u201d said Sarah Jampel.Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead MorecultureI\u2019ll Always Love Campari, But This American Aperitivo Is My New One and OnlyBy Alex DelanycookingWhy I'm Still Having Happy Hour, Even At a DistanceBy Al CullitoncookingThis 4-Ingredient Amaro Spritz Is Your Ultimate Pre-Dinner DrinkBy Alex DelanycookingThis Cocktail Is Called the Rattlesnake, and That\u2019s Reason Enough to Make ItBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
