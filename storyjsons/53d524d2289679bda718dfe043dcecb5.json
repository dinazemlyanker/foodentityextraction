The coffee shop manages to serve some very tender croissants, and they\u2019re serious about the coffee too, roasting their own beans.THE VIBE IS: well, democratic! Library folks (read students of all ages), trendy boutique workers, and pastry fiends flock here.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open every day Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u2014Christine MuhlkePhoto by Ditte IsagerWE ALSO LOVEThe Coffee CollectiveA pour-over (and upcycled coffee kombucha) is always in reach, thanks to this mini chainLa BanchinaGet real R&R in at this Amager Harbor vegetable-focused restaurant with a few surprisesMirabellePlan a mini croissant- and yogurt-filled vacation at this caf\u00e9-like spot in N\u00f8rreboroExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
