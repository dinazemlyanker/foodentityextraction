It\u2019s a wonder I still have taste buds. On the other hand, I hate tepid drinks as much as that Dr. Seuss character hates green eggs and ham: I will not drink lukewarm coffee, Sam I Am. So when I get halfway through my mug of hot whatever and it\u2019s already room temp, find me either pouring it down the drain or hanging out by the microwave, constantly reheating my sad partially drank drink.The Ember Temperature Control Smart Mug was designed for overzealous people like me. Made of stainless steel with a ceramic coating, this heated coffee mug lets you regulate the precise\u00a0temperature of your drink with a Bluetooth connection and the Ember\u00a0app on your phone. Welcome to the future.Ember Temperature Control Smart Mug, 10 oz.$110 $100 at Amazon$100 at Bed Bath & BeyondYes, these here are pricey cups. But think of all the cold coffee that will no longer go to waste! The smart mug sits on a saucer that doubles as a charger, which is included with the Ember ceramic mug but also available separately in case you want one for every room. Leave your cup of coffee on the charging coaster and it\u2019ll stay hot indefinitely, or you can walk around with it\u2014to meetings, to the bathroom, to show off your steaming hot beverage to your neighbor\u2014while the self-heating mug takes care of the rest. The battery life of the Ember, indicated by a little LED display, will keep your bev at the desired temperature for over an hour before needing to recharge.\u00a0The white 10-ounce Ember\u00a0mug I have (it's also available in a 14-ounce version) washes easily and has stood up to turmeric, chaga mushroom powder, and hibiscus-based drinks in addition to hot coffee and espresso drinks. It also comes in black ceramic and a range of metallics\u2014just don\u2019t put any of them in the dishwasher. Ember makes a 12-ounce heated travel mug too, so if a normal insulated thermos isn't keeping that very last drop of matcha hot, it might be worth the admittedly steep price.Ember Temperature Control Travel Mug, 12 Oz.$248 at Amazon$180 at TargetLastly, I will note that this heated coffee mug's max temperature setting is 145 degrees Fahrenheit (the lowest is 120), and though that\u2019s safer for my mouth, it\u2019s just not quite as hot as I like the drinking temperature of my liquids. But, you know, that\u2019s probably for the best, since hanging on to these few remaining taste buds is important for both my pleasure and my job.Could be hotter tbh.\nThis article was originally published in 2019 and was updated by MacKenzie Chung Fegan in 2022.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingLifestyleRecipes you want to make.
