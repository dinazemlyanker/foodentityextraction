It\u2019s where I brush my teeth and sleep. And sometimes\u2014if there\u2019s a phenomenal lobby bar\u2014where I have a drink. But during a stay at Raleigh, North Carolina\u2019s Guest House, a historic home that was recently transformed into an eight-room inn, I found myself spending a suspicious amount of time on the property.First there are the rooms, furnished in the clean, minimalist way I wish my apartment was: Breezy white linens. Sleek white lighting fixtures. Touches of light wood. Modular desks. Little Marshall speakers that beg to be plugged into. Then there\u2019s the communal kitchen area and the backyard\u2014two of the most appealing places to be. The brick patio, with its views out onto downtown and its smattering of places to sit and kick back, is the perfect spot to hang in the afternoon; and the kitchen, with is bright, airy vibe and small cafe tables offers prime breakfast-time seating.The clean view from one of the kitchen\u2019s cafe tables.\nPhoto by Emily LyonswoodBut what makes all this even more pleasant is the inn\u2019s proximity to some of Raleigh\u2019s finest food and drink shops. Five minutes to Brewery Bhavana to buy cold beer. A minute further to Short Walk Wines for bottles of natty, light-bodied French red. A quick walk in the opposite direction puts you at Transfer Co. Food Hall, home of Raleigh\u2019s excellent Benchwarmers Bagels.So, yeah, I still got to spend lots of time roaming the city. It just meant that I planned each day around exactly the right places I wanted to hit up, so I could pick exactly the right spoils to bring back to my adopted home.Go there: Guest HouseExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRaleigh, NCHotelsTravelRecipes you want to make.
