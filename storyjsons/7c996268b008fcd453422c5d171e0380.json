She uses frozen sour cherries for this recipe (they\u2019re pitted, which saves time), but you can use fresh ones when they\u2019re in season. To avoid a cracked cheesecake, don\u2019t overwork the cream cheese mixture; be sure to line the baking pan; bake it slowly (if you know your oven runs hot, you can drop the temperature 25 degrees); and let the cheesecake cool gradually.Ingredients8 - 10 ServingsCheesecakeNonstick vegetable oil spray1\u00bdsleeves graham crackers (about 13)7Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted1lb. 5 oz. cream cheese, room temperature\u2154cup plain whole-milk Greek yogurt, \troom temperature3large eggs, beaten to blend1cup sugar1Tbsp. all-purpose flourPinch of kosher salt1Tbsp. vanilla extract1tsp. finely grated lemon zest1Tbsp. fresh lemon juiceCherries and assembly14oz. frozen pitted sour cherries or one 24-oz. jar, drained\u00bdcup (or more) sugar1Tbsp. cornstarchspecial equipmentA 9\"-diameter springform panPreparationCheesecakeStep 1Lightly coat pan with nonstick spray and line bottom with a parchment paper round. Pulse graham crackers in a food processor until finely ground. (Or crush in a resealable plastic bag with a rolling pin.) Drizzle in butter; pulse to combine. Press into bottom of prepared pan, packing with a measuring cup. Chill until firm, about 30 minutes.Step 2Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 325\u00b0. Using an electric mixer, beat cream cheese and yogurt in a large bowl until smooth. Add eggs, sugar, flour, and salt and beat until just combined. Mix in vanilla, lemon zest, and lemon juice.Step 3Pour filling into pan and gently tap on counter to evenly distribute; set on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake cheesecake until filling is set but still wobbly in the center, 55\u201365 minutes. Turn off oven and prop door open. Let sit in oven 10 minutes.

In my oven, it was already firmly baked and set at 55 minutes, no wobbly middle at all.  It didn't crack at all, but the flavor was disappointing.  Were I to make this recipe again, I'd put a bit of sugar in the graham cracker crust recipe, turn the heat down, use no lemon zest, and add some vanilla to the cherry topping. 3 stars only, not 5.AnonymousLawrence Kansas5/15/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titCheesecakeCakeDessertCherryStone FruitFruitCream CheeseCheeseNut-FreeBakingFourth Of JulyMemorial DayLabor DayRecipes you want to make.
