Yes and yes.By Alex BeggsMay 4, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailMichael Graydon + Nikole HerriottFacebookTwitterEmailEvery Friday morning, Bon App\u00e9tit senior staff writer Alex Beggs shares weekly highlights from the BA offices, from awesome new recipes to office drama to restaurant recs, with some weird (food!) stuff she saw on the internet thrown in. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Good salad alertI picked up some crispy romaine hearts (they never let me down! Except with the salmonella!) because I was craving one of my favorite springy salad dressings, which is Vivian Howard\u2019s pecan butter-honey vinaigrette. You essentially make pecan butter, then sweeten it with honey, loosen it up with olive oil, add lemon juice for acid, and that\u2019s it. Now I need to track down some sugar snap peas.Get the recipe: Romaine and Sugar Snap Peas with Pecan DressingPhoto by Gustavo VivancoThis was cut from the storyAbout halfway to the airport I realized I forgot to pack underwear. I\u2019d been so anxious and sleepless before I went to Peru to write about this magnificent restaurant next to an Inca ruin (pictured above) that I made detailed lists of every outfit. To be prepared. But in those lists, I\u2019d failed to mention the unmentionables. In Lima, I set off on an underwear mission. \u201cRopa interior?!?!\u201d I pleaded. I ended up with several boxes of sporty but too small Jacky Forms. My favorite Peruvian undergarments came from a boutique where I\u2019d held up a pair of XS undies on hangers and asked the saleswoman if they came in Medium. Then she took them off the hanger, stretched the waist as wide as she could, and said, \u201cLook, medium!\u201d Sold.Want this letter before it hits the website?

Gaby doesn\u2019t let Brad get away with anything, and it\u2019s glorious. And hey, we have the recipes! Watch it and make empanadas this weekend and then bring me one.Get the recipe: Argentinian Beef EmpanadasBrad\u2019s big fishBrad keeps getting surprise gifty deliveries of huge fish from far-flung places. (Rachel Karten for scale, above.) These are the kind of work perks you get when you\u2019re Brad. On Thursday, he kept showing off this baby shark-sized thing, taking his time to wash it slowly, filet it thoroughly, and offer as many opportunities as possible for people to gawk at his big (40 lb.!) fish. So congrats Brad, you got a big fish! Here\u2019s to many more in your future.Oh lord what have you doneBody sweatsAlex LauI went to the Hot Sauce Expo a few weeks ago, but nothing makes my whole body increase temp like the food at Ugly Baby. And yet my body NEEDS IT. This week I got takeout from the phenom Thai spot and discovered a new technique. After I ate the funky-sour-crispy duck salad, I felt my insides burst into flames, swallowed a gulp of beer, and then chased it with a bite of string cheese. This is not a patented technique, nor is it glamorous, but it worked in a way that milk/bread/white rice never has. Which means more duck salad for me, for you, for all of us (within the tri-state area).Guacamole cheese existsThe pallor of the Wicked Witch of the West. The flavor of overripe avocados and preservatives. I\u2019m gonna sit this one out.Read this instead\u201c...if there\u2019s a population that is underserved, there is one that\u2019s overserved too. We can order takeout on our phones, have entire meals delivered to our doors. We can eliminate certain foods from our diets because we are flush. We seek out the most magical olive oil, argue about the best wood for grilling, whisper about which clandestine corner to meet the raw milk guy. I care about these things too. But we need to find balance in our love affair with food.\u201dRead it: Why I Gave Up on the New York Food Scene to Work in a Soup KitchenCherry tomato ChaeyWhat's for lunch?Hey friends, I need your etiquette questions about office lunch, and not just the one about microwaving fish. Is a lunch beer acceptable if your boss is paying? What about a second? This is for the September issue of Bon App\u00e9tit! Send your questions my way at staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.Unnecessary food meme of the weekUnnecessary food feud of the weekPhoto by Lisa Larsen/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty ImagesThis week, Sarah Jampel made a plea for better vegetarian options at weddings, which got us talking about the more-often-than-not sorry state of all wedding food. (Except for Molly Baz\u2019s: \u201cYou should have seen the raw bar!\u201d) A tiny postcard appears and you have to circle your doom. So what is it, I asked the (meat-eating) staff, the chicken or the steak?\u201cHere\u2019s a cheap thing you can have for free, or an expensive thing you can have for free,\u201d said Alex Delany. \u201cI\u2019ll take the expensive one.\u201d I\u2019ll put you and \u201cI\u2019m not payin\u2019\u201d Molly down for steak, then. Emma Wartzman would rather have dry chicken than chewy steak, but Jesse Sparks would rather have bad steak than unseasoned chicken. Sasha Levine and Chaey will be too busy dancing. Geography nut Adam Rapoport asks, \u201cIs the wedding in Tuscany or Texas?\u201d Because \u201cif so, I\u2019m the steak. Everywhere else, the chicken.\u201d Andy Baraghani is \u201ca tequila on the rocks with a side of chicken.\u201d Carla Lalli Music is under the impression that steak offers less opportunity for \u201ccross-contamination,\u201d which, okay, Carla. Elyse Inamine will have the fish. And Meryl Rothstein doesn\u2019t care. \u201cI\u2019m there for the apps,\u201d she said expertly. \u201cI\u2019m going to fill up on apps, and then the chicken is irrelevant.\u201d(Or opt for pineapple salad, like the Kennedys!)Explore Bon App\u00e9titBeggs NewsletterRead Morerecipes20 Rules For Making the Best Salads of Your LifeGallery20 SlidesBy Sarah JampelcultureJoy, Pain, and Puke at the 2019 Hot Sauce ExpoBy Alex BeggsPhotography by Amy LombardcultureWhat Happened When I Asked My Friends to Recipe Test My CookbookBy Priya KrishnarestaurantsWhere Potatoes Pass From the Ice to the SunBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
