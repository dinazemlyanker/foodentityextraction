Next up is Kaleo Kanahele Maclay, Paralympic volleyball player, coffee shop owner, and cookie decorator.\u201cMy coach always says, \u2018You can have one sip of coffee if you take one sip of water,\u2019\u201d Kaleo Kanahele Maclay says, holding up a can of grapefruit seltzer in one hand and a cold brew with oat milk in the other. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019d consider this water,\u201d she cocks her head toward the pink can, \u201cbut it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Maclay\u2019s coach had tried cutting her off entirely, but she wouldn\u2019t have it. \u201cI was, like, \u201cWell, that\u2019s not gonna work; I will not be awake,\u201d she says.It\u2019s a humid day in downtown Oklahoma and I can see Maclay\u2019s beverages condensing through the Zoom screen as she shows me a new green and yellow macram\u00e9 piece on the apartment wall behind her. A short walk away, Maclay\u2019s husband is churning out drinks at their coffee, bakery, and floral shop, Flour & Flower, which is where she\u2019d be right now if she wasn\u2019t talking to me. Running a business in and of itself would make a person busy, but the 25-year-old Maclay is also a mom and a cookie decorator and a setter for the U.S. sitting volleyball team, which she has been training with since she was 12. At the time we\u2019re chatting, they\u2019re currently gearing up for the Paralympic Games, starting August 24 in Tokyo.Off the court I learn that Maclay is every bit as optimistic and capable as her sport demands. \u201cMy mom raised me as though I didn\u2019t have a disability,\u201d she says. \u201cI was born with a club foot and had surgery at eight months, but she didn\u2019t want the focus to be on my limitations. So I grew up doing ballet, gymnastics, basketball, softball, volleyball\u2014all the things.\u201d Where volleyball is all competition, baking and cookie decorating is Maclay\u2019s alone time. \u201cI can listen to podcasts or audio books, have my personal space, and just lose myself in the task,\u201d she says.Just before Maclay\u2019s set to leave for Tokyo, she tells me how she deals with the pressure, why teamwork is everything, and which Trader Joe\u2019s snack she\u2019ll never leave home without.I started baking\u2026 right after the 2016 Rio Paralympic Games. I asked myself, What do I want to do, who do I want to be, when all of this is over? Growing up I always thought my sister was the artist and I was the athlete\u2014that\u2019s the box I put myself in. So I started experimenting with cookie decorating to rediscover my creative side.I fell in love with Hawaii\u2019s coffee culture... while we were living there in 2019. My husband and I opened Flower & Flour back in Oklahoma City last October with a friend, to house everything we loved: pastries, coffee, and flowers. We signed our lease just before the pandemic, the games were postponed, and we only just opened in October. We didn\u2019t have all the money we needed, but it was just about starting somewhere and doing what we could, where we were, with what we had.The menu is full of\u2026 nostalgic favorites. We have a raspberry jam bar, which I always ate after practice during high school. We also make a lot of scones and fresh croissants on the weekends; those are a real labor of love. I also make sure we always have something gluten-free because my mom has an autoimmune disease. She milks it so hard and is like, \u201cYou\u2019ve got three muffins? Give them all to me, I can\u2019t have anything else!\u201dMy day starts at 4:30 a.m.\u2026 when I head to the shop to bake whatever we need for the day. Then I\u2019m back home around 6:30 a.m. to get my son, Duke, ready for school and hang out with my husband. (I love making avocado toast for breakfast; avocado all day!) By 8 a.m. I\u2019m on the court training, and after lunch with the team, I\u2019m back at the shop.My husband is such a good cook\u2026 so he usually makes dinner. We eat a lot of salmon, vegan tacos with cashew cheese, and Spam, rice, and eggs, which is a Hawaiian specialty. The other night he said, \u201cWhen we retire, you\u2019re cooking every meal.\u201d And I was like, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll just eat out every night; it\u2019s cool!\u201dThe snack I\u2019m definitely packing for Tokyo is\u2026 Trader Joe\u2019s Speculoos Cookies\u2014they\u2019re so cinnamony and so good! Our team dietitian is all about balance; there\u2019s no real sense of restriction.Being grateful takes the pressure off\u2026 before matches. I can have this tunnel vision, like, \u201cI have to win.\u201d Right before the game we line up as a team. I\u2019m number 14, so I\u2019m usually pretty close to the end. Seeing my team in front of me, and the court in the distance, helps me really appreciate being there\u2014because I know it won\u2019t last forever. When I can take that step back and see the broader view of what I\u2019m doing, I remember that even if we don\u2019t win it\u2019s not the end of the world.Teamwork is central\u2026 to my life. Even if I don\u2019t agree with my business partners all the time, we have this common goal for the coffee shop to succeed. It\u2019s the same with volleyball, where we\u2019re all on the same path trying to win gold, and in my family, where at the end of the day we just want one other to be happy. It\u2019s all about finding common ground.Explore Bon App\u00e9titPerson of InterestHealthyishprofileRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
