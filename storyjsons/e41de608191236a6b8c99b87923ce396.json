You know all those open-face sandwiches on grainy bread you\u2019ve been seeing for the last few years? They take their inspiration from this Danish sandwich place, which makes delicious works of art out of Scandi treats like smoked and pickled herring, seedy bread, and potatoes.ORDER THE: the herring plate of the day; potato sandwich with smoked mayo and fried onions; and smoked eel with scrambled egg and chives. The 110 sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d combinations pair well with the 140 schnapps and aquavits.THE VIBE IS: men who lunch.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open for lunch Monday through Saturday, from 11:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. (though the kitchen closes at 4 p.m.). Closed Sunday. Book online; this place is always full.\u2014Christine MuhlkePhoto by Ditte IsagerWE ALSO LOVERestaurant Pal\u00e6gadeHead to Indre By to eat all the open-face sandwiches (and herring)AmassHidden in Refshale\u00f8en, an elaborate root-to-stem tasting menuBarabbaMake the most of your jet lag by staying up all night at this Indre By chefs\u2019 hauntExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
