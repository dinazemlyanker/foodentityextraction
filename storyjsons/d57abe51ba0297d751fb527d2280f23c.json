But I\u2019m here to convince you that it\u2019s not. It\u2019s really, really not.I tried this savory cashew butter for the first time when I headed to Portland, Maine, to cook with chef Ben Jackson of Drifters Wife, which this year took the #9 spot on our list of America's Best New Restaurants. At the restaurant, Jackson serves this cashew butter under tiny roasted fairy tale eggplants with pickled peppers.This nut butter is nothing like the stuff you'll find in a jar, yet is simple to make. You start by cooking cashews in a little oil along with shallots and garlic until they get all golden brown and delicious. And then Jackson pulls a unexpected move: He adds fish sauce and lime juice and blends them until they are as smooth as tahini. What results is a supremely creamy, umami-rich cashew sauce.  Grilled vegetables? They beg to be doused with this sauce. Roast chicken? Spread some of this underneath and tell me it\u2019s not the best damn chicken you\u2019ve ever tasted. It is also your newest cold noodle sauce, as well as the perfect alternative to standard tahini dressing.To call this a nut butter is to minimize its real potential. It\u2019s a dip, it\u2019s a spread, it\u2019s a dressing, it\u2019s a sauce. Cashews can be expensive so yes, it\u2019s a bit of an investment. But if you consider the heavy lifting a powerhouse sauce like this can do for everything from a bowl of plain grains to blanched veg, I think you\u2019ll agree that it\u2019s worth it.Get the recipe:Eggplant with Cashew Butter and Pickled PeppersMake this cashew butter once, and you\u2019ll want to use it on roasted vegetables year-round.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCashewNut ButterSauceHot 10 2018Hot 10Read MorecookingA Fairy Tale Eggplant Recipe That Comes With an Irresistible Cashew SauceBy Aliza AbarbanelcookingThese Rice Noodles in Cashew Sauce Are Easier Than Ordering TakeoutBy Julia BlackChocolate-Cashew ButterRecipes you want to make.
