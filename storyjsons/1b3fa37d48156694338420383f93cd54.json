It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.\u201cDid you skim the fat?\u201dNo. My better half made the March cover star recipe for Sohui Kim\u2019s braised Korean short ribs last weekend and WOW, WERE THEY GOOD. So rich and fatty and shreddy. I made the sides: Andy\u2019s crispy Persian rice, crunchy gochujang fennel (necessary to cut the fat of the short ribs), and this nutty napa cabbage salad my colleague Elyse Inamine talks about all the time (lived up to the hype, thanks Elyse!). Rachel Karten and Emma Wartzman also made the short ribs, and we compared notes. They skimmed fat off the top, I didn\u2019t. Rachel served hers with big lettuce cups (and made epic leftover fried rice cooked in the jus); Emma made a side of pickled cucumbers, sticky rice, and kimchi. Sounds to me like you should all make this!Get the recipe: Red Wine and Soy\u2013Braised Short RibsWhat are the oddsOn Tuesday, I was in the Test Kitchen tasting a few upcoming dishes and avoiding writing. Molly Baz was toiling over a matzoh ball recipe, and didn\u2019t hold back when asking everyone what they preferred: \u201cA tightly rolled ball, or a delicate crumbly ball, or a bouncy ball?\u201d She set out three versions cooked in various combinations, some with seltzer, some without, one with dill (the underdog), etc. The journey for that continues. Chris Morocco was sitting at his station with his head in his palm and asked me wearily: \u201cBeggs, do you want a not very good chocolate chip cookie?\u201d I thought about it for a good six seconds. Then I whispered to Chris as I broke a cookie in half, \u201cit is my birthday\u201d\u2014a fact I hadn\u2019t shared with anyone in the office. \u201cWait, really?\u201d He asked, perking up from his cookie failure slouch. Yes, really. \u201cIt\u2019s my birthday too!\u201d And that\u2019s when we discovered we have the same birthday, and keep the same secrets.Here\u2019s a chocolate chip cookie recipe you can count on.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Get moderately rich, moderately quickBy following this entrepreneurial couple\u2019s guidelines for reselling Trader Joe\u2019s Everything But the Bagel Spice on Amazon. Oh wait, because of their eagerness to share their trade secrets, the price of the spice mix can fluctuate and make the whole thing not very worth it. Womp womp. Looks like the spice is going for $6.25 right now\u2014it\u2019s $1.99 in stores. 6 Amazon reviews out of 958 point out this difference, the rest of the world doesn\u2019t seem to care.The best part of the story: \u201cthe Herberts don\u2019t actually like the Everything But the Bagel seasoning. (Juston admits in the video that it\u2019s \u201cnot bad\u201d on eggs, but otherwise they\u2019re over it.)\u201dNeed a little crafty project? Make your own everything spice and upsell it online. Or just make this new everything bagel quiche!Unnecessary food meme of the week(Don\u2019t worry! He\u2019s okay. I think?)Photo by Chelsie CraigUnnecessary food feud of the weekClaire Saffitz was working on an [undisclosed] project that included a few (somewhere between 6 and 12) pans of cooling cakes, including carrot cake\u2014hold the raisins. It turns out Claire has two raisins on her shoulders where most people have a little devil and a little angel. One of the raisins is wrinkly, shriveled, snuck into an oatmeal cookie. \u201cI don\u2019t want to eat them ever,\u201d she said definitively. \u201cI know they\u2019re just grapes but I don\u2019t even like grapes. Except wine.\u201d The other raisin is a Raisinet. \u201cWellllll, don\u2019t put this in there, but I do like a Raisinet. Oh, and I\u2019m fine with raisins in a mostarda.\u201d Claire, pick a side! Pro-raisin Alex Delany addressed the heated debate on Basically this week, where we published a new recipe that includes raisins with...fish? Yep. Raisins rarely appear in Bon App\u00e9tit recipes, revealed Carla Lalli Music, because \u201cthey have the power to divide us.\u201d Carla doesn\u2019t mind, say, throwing back a little box of them at a preschool mixer. But she has a philosophical question: \u201cI don't understand why raisins are so hate-inducing, like do people FREAK OUT over other dried fruit? No. No they don't. Dried cherry. Date. Currant even. No one gets mad.\u201d In the background, Alex Lau crept out of a photo studio, grabbed a croque monsieur from a sheet pan, and disappeared into the night.My favorite raisin-adjacent recipe is this decadent duck confit with pickled raisins.
