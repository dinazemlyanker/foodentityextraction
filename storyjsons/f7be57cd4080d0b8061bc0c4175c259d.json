Would it be baked in a loaf pan? How about a springform? Would it have fresh or jammy strawberries? Or was this the time for freeze-dried? Would it be tall and lofty or short and squat? I stressed about it and came to no conclusion. I did know that no matter how the cake would look, it had to be as simple as possible: Because the easier the cake, the more likely you are to bake it (especially when it\u2019s summer and the beach is calling).The problem, though, was that I adamant that the strawberries be roasted before being incorporated into the cake batter. Because strawberries are among the most watery fruits (they\u2019re about 92% water, nearly as watery as watermelon), they leak a lot of moisture into batter, leaving damp, flavorless blueish-grayish pockets. By roasting the strawberries first, I\u2019d rid them of excess moisture while intensifying their sweetness and color. It was a bit of extra time and a handful of additional dishes to wash, but I was sure it would be worth it.Watch these disappear, one slice at a time.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Yekaterina BoytsovaAnd so versions one through eight (yes, there was a lot of cake) started off with olive oil-roasted strawberries, strewn atop cake batter in a 9-inch round cake pan. But the roasted berries, so much heavier than the liquidy batter, sank into the middle of the cake. I kept tinkering with other variables\u2014the number of eggs, the amount of leavener, the volume of flour\u2014to try to keep the fruit afloat. Some of the changes I made I liked\u2014I added cornmeal to bulk up the batter, create a slight crunch, and enhance the sunny-yellow color, and I swirled in strawberry jam for streaks of fruit flavor throughout\u2014but the recipe was getting complicated. I played with using a mix of roasted and fresh berries, of layering the batter with the fruit, of finishing the cake with a lemon-turbinado glaze. I knew it was getting fussy, but I didn\u2019t know how to stop.But before I tried versions 9 through 18, I (thankfully!) made one simple change that solved all my issues: By pouring the cake batter into a 13x9-inch pan instead of a round, I could distribute it in a thinner layer over a greater area. The cake set faster in the oven, which meant the strawberries had less time to sink. And because I was no longer worried about the fruit falling deep into the batter and creating those yucky mushy spots, I didn\u2019t have to bother with roasting them either. Now, I could just slice the strawberries and lay them on the top of the cake, where they\u2019d be exposed to the high heat of the oven. Dramatic sigh of relief. Instead of sogging out, they get jammy\u2014almost like I, well, roasted them.The happy ending is that the most straight-forward version of this cake also tasted (and looked) the best.  It\u2019s so pretty it needs no additional elaborations, it\u2019s durable enough to tote to a cookout or a picnic, and yes, it\u2019s simple enough to make with no advance planning and just an hour of free time. And, as it turns out, it\u2019s just the strawberry cake we were looking for all along.Get the recipe:Strawberry Snacking CakeDon\u2019t be surprised at how quickly this olive oil and cornmeal-enriched sheet cake will disappear.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titSummerStrawberryCakeRecipes you want to make.
