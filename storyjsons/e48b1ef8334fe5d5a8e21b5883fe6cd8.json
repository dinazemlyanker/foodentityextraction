Our panel of experts (including Claire!) have answers\u2014in language even beginners can understand.By MacKenzie Chung FeganMay 7, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailIn 2019, everyone I knew was avoiding gluten. In 2020, everyone I know is making sourdough bread. My Instagram feed is cluttered with people showing off their burbling starters, the open crumb of their loaves, and their flamboyantly vertiginous ears.I am no exception. In mid-March, I dropped by Otway in Brooklyn\u2014which makes an excellent miche\u2014to pick up a sourdough starter. I\u2019m now four loaves in, with a fifth currently fermenting away. My bread is good, but I am plagued by the knowledge that it could be better. It\u2019s as if I\u2019ve just learned the quadratic equation, and although I\u2019m getting the correct answer, I have no idea why I\u2019m doing what I\u2019m doing or why the formula works. I have questions. Maybe you do too?So for all you other sourdough starters (heh heh) out there, I assembled a panel of experts\u2014Josey Baker, author of Josey Baker Bread; Amanda Turner, former baker at Odd Duck; Joy Huang, home baker of Instagram renown; and our own Claire Saffitz, who needs no further introduction. I peppered them with questions about making sourdough bread, and here\u2019s what I learned. If you have no sourdough experience, all this might go a little over your head. But if you\u2019ve found a basic recipe you like (here are a couple that are good for beginners) and are one or two loaves in, this article is for you. Let\u2019s get to it.I\u2019m trying to conserve flour. How often do I need to feed my starter?If you\u2019re baking a few times a week, keep it on the counter and feed it every day. If you\u2019re a less regular baker, Claire Saffitz advises that you store it in the fridge, so you only need to feed it weekly. \u201cKeeping the starter cold will slow down the activity, so that it requires fewer rounds of feeding,\u201d she says. Joy Huang adds that you also don\u2019t need to have all that much of it: \u201cIf you maintain a smaller starter, you need to feed it less,\u201d she says. \u201cYou really just need a tablespoon of starter, but since such a tiny amount is hard to maintain, I keep around 30 grams.\u201dHow do I know my starter is ready to bake with, aside from the float test?\u201cThe float test is a pretty good indicator,\u201d says Amanda Turner, \u201cbut the best thing is to become intimately acquainted with your starter so that you know what it looks like when it\u2019s ready.\u201d Your starter should have grown at least twice in volume\u2014mark your container with tape or a rubber band so you can tell\u2014and should have large bubbles. It will look shiny and viscous. As for the smell, Josey Baker says you\u2019re looking for an aroma of sweet, yogurt-y acidity. \u201cIf you let it ferment beyond that, you\u2019ll get more of a vinegar-y acidic smell,\u201d he says. \u201cYou want it to be very alive. Better to have your pre-ferment to be over ripe than under ripe.\u201dWhat do I do with my sourdough starter discard?Use it to make crackers, or add it to quickbreads, muffins, and pancakes for a tangy, sour flavor. In general, a sourdough starter is half flour and half water, so you can use it in place of some of the flour and liquid in an existing recipe. Or, make crepes:Watch Claire make crepes!\nThere are different approaches to the autolyse process, where the flour is hydrated and allowed to rest to encourage gluten development. Some recipes have you mix the flour and water and then rest before adding the starter and the salt, and some have you mix the flour and water and starter and then rest before adding the salt. Is there a difference?This is a matter of preference. Claire prefers to mix only the flour and water initially. \u201cIf you add the starter to the mixture and then do autolyse, you're effectively starting bulk fermentation,\u201d she says. \u201cI find I have more control over the bulk fermentation process if I wait to add the starter until after autolyse.\u201d But Josey and Amanda counsel that home bakers can add the starter right away without negative effects\u2014unless you\u2019re using artisan flour. \u201cIf your flour has been freshly milled, it can be difficult to get it to hydrate, so I would take the extra time for autolyse\u201d Amanda explains. \u201cHydrating the flour and the water makes the proteins more available.\u201d There\u2019s no point at which you\u2019re necessarily \u201cdone\u201d with autolyse\u2014it\u2019s just a matter of if you want to give your flour a head start on hydrating before adding your starter.The crumb shot.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, prop styling by Rebecca BartosheskyI\u2019ve heard a lot about \u201chigh hydration\u201d dough. What does this mean, and why do people talk about it so much?If you\u2019ve gone down a sourdough Instagram rabbit hole, you\u2019ve no doubt seen those super aerated crumb shots that are more hole than actual bread. Those are thanks to a high hydration dough, which usually results in a more custardy loaf than lower hydration doughs, which are typically chewy and dense. While there\u2019s no set-in-stone definition for a high hydration dough, the consensus is that anything over 80% hydration qualifies. But the result is a loose, sticky dough that is hard for a beginner to wrangle. \u201cPeople go nuts for those open crumb pics on social media,\u201d Joy laments, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s hard to eat! It\u2019s full of holes!\u201d Josey recommends ignoring the hype and focusing instead on a dough that is \u201cproperly\u201d hydrated\u2014a metric that will vary depending on what type of flour you\u2019re using, but that you\u2019ll learn to recognize with practice.I weighed out all my ingredients and combined them correctly, but my dough looks drier than it\u2019s supposed to. What happened, and what do I do?Claire and Josey would like to reassure you that it\u2019s all going to be okay. \u201cIt's normal in the beginning for a dough to seem dry,\u201d Claire says, \u201cespecially after the minimal mixing required to start autolyse. The flours hydrate over time and the texture will significantly change when you add the salt, and then again throughout bulk fermentation.\u201d If you're using a higher percentage of whole wheat flour than the recipe calls for and your dough looks dry, Josey advises adding a tablespoon or two more of water. But in the end, \u201cit\u2019s totally okay to have your dough be drier or wetter,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine.\u201dI want to start incorporating whole wheat flour/spelt flour/einkorn/rye/whatever. Can I just swap some in for normal bread flour in my recipe?The experts say you should be okay substituting up to 20% of the total flour weight, but once you get beyond that, seek out a specific bread recipe using the flour of your choice. Whole wheat flour is thirstier than white flour, so you\u2019ll need to add more water to your dough. Whole grain flours also tend to ferment faster because there are more nutrients for the yeast to chomp on, so you might need to either use less starter or adjust your timing accordingly.Can I add spices/cheese/seeds/other flavorings to my dough? At what point do I do that? Will certain ingredients give me trouble?Salt and fat can impair fermentation and gluten development, so add something like cheese late in the process\u2014maybe one or two stretch-and-folds before you\u2019re ready to shape. \u201cThirsty\u201d add-ins like seeds or dried fruit need to be pre-soaked in water and then drained before being incorporated, otherwise they will impact the dough\u2019s hydration. Josey urges you to go wild: \u201cI always encourage people to experiment,\u201d he says. \u201cSeeds and nuts will be better if you toast them. Cinnamon can get very weird\u2014it creates a gelatinous goo that seems to hinder some of the fermentation, which I know sounds gross\u2014but it\u2019s very delicious so you should do it.\u201dSome recipes tell you to knead or mix the dough until it passes the windowpane test before starting bulk fermentation. Other recipes omit this, telling you only to do a series of stretch and folds during bulk fermentation. To knead or not to knead?Josey and Amanda don\u2019t knead, relying only on the stretch and folds to build gluten. Claire, however, recommends that home bakers work the dough to ensure that they\u2019re developing strength early on in the process. Do whatever feels right to you, or try both methods and see which one you prefer.How do I know if my dough is done with bulk fermentation? What am I looking for?Josey does at least three or four stretch and folds over a three to four hour window. \u201cVolume is a very effective way of telling when you\u2019re done,\u201d he says. \u201cYou want the dough to have increased in volume by one third to one half.\u201d But sometimes, Amanda cautions, it\u2019s not as simple as that. \u201cSometimes the dough doesn\u2019t rise that much\u2014or maybe it doubles, but it\u2019s not bubbly,\u201d she says. As an insurance policy, she always retards her dough in the refrigerator overnight after shaping. \u201cYou\u2019re giving the yeast more time to be active, so you\u2019re buying yourself more wiggle room in case you end bulk fermentation too early.\u201dBrad and Claire making sourdough bread together is\u2026definitely worth watching.\nDo I need to buy bannetons? Can I just use a bowl?Joy swears by bannetons. \u201cI have tried using a bowl a couple of times,\u201d she says, \u201cand my results are never as good as with a banneton.\u201d The breathability of bannetons help wick away moisture from your loaf, preventing it from sticking when you turn it out. But Amanda, Claire, and Josey say that a bowl lined with a linen kitchen towel generously floured with AP and white rice flour (if you have it) is an acceptable substitute. Perhaps even better is a colander or a basket, which allows for air flow.How do I know if I\u2019ve done a good job of shaping my loaf?All the experts agree that a well-shaped loaf takes practice. \u201cWatch videos of pros shaping,\u201d Joy advises. \u201cThey do it quickly without touching the dough too much. Find the happy medium where you\u2019re being aggressive but not tearing it.\u201d You\u2019re trying to achieve surface tension. \u201cA poorly shaped loaf looks very flabby, like it doesn\u2019t have any structure,\u201d Amanda says. \u201cA well shaped loaf has a look of tension.\u201dHow do I know if my dough is done proofing? And should I retard my dough by proofing in the refrigerator?Josey and Joy don\u2019t find the poke test (where the dough springs back slowly, leaving only a small indentation) particularly helpful. Josey instead recommends monitoring the volume of the dough, keeping an eye out for an increase of 25%. But all the experts recommend proofing the dough in the refrigerator overnight, which, Claire says, \u201cnot only allows more control over when you can bake the loaves, but also control over the flavor, too.\u201d The longer the dough ferments in a cold environment, the sourer it will be. Joy also finds that it\u2019s easier to score her intricate designs on dough pulled straight from the refrigerator.Can I freeze my dough after the final proof?No.Why am I taking a razor to my loaf? How deep should my cuts be? What if I don\u2019t have a lame or a razor?If you\u2019ve built up enough gluten and there\u2019s enough yeast activity, your bread will have oven spring\u2014meaning it will puff up and get some height while it bakes. If you don\u2019t score it, it will crack. Cutting into the loaf allows you to control where it will open up. \u201cIf you\u2019re only going to do one or two scores, go deep,\u201d Joy recommends\u2014at least a quarter of an inch. \u201cBut if you\u2019re doing a lot, you can score at different depths to have different effects\u201d like leaves or patterns. If you don\u2019t have a lame or a razor, you can use the blade of a food processor, an X-Acto knife, a pair of scissors, or a serrated knife.How can I safely transfer my dough from the proofing basket or bowl to this blazing hot Dutch oven?There\u2019s another advantage to proofing your dough overnight in the fridge\u2014cold dough will be easier to maneuver. Flip it out onto a sheet of parchment paper cut in the shape of a watch. The \u201carms\u201d of the watch will help you lower your loaf into the hot Dutch oven. Joy crumples up her parchment and runs it under the tap for a second to build up extra steam. If you don\u2019t have a Dutch oven\u2014or a cast iron combo cooker, which makes it even easier to transfer your bread into the preheated pan\u2014Josey recommends a baking stone and an overturned metal bowl.How do I know, by looking at my finished loaf, if I overproofed or underproofed my dough, or did something else wrong?Your loaf might be underproofed if the inside is tight and a little tough or if the bubbles are concentrated in one area and smaller or non-existent in others.Your loaf might be overproofed if your loaf has a nice, supple interior but you didn\u2019t get much oven spring\u2014for example, you made a cut but it didn\u2019t open.Your loaf might have been improperly shaped if you have one or two abnormally large holes.You might not have created enough of a steam-saturated environment for the first half of the bake if your crust is pale. Or this could mean that the dough was over fermented, so there weren\u2019t enough sugars left in the crust.My loaf is overbaked on the bottom. Any tricks?Joy\u2019s wet parchment trick helps with this, but you could also raise the position of the rack or lower your baking temperature by 35 to 50 degrees after you remove the lid of your Dutch oven. Or, as Josey suggests, remove your loaf from the Dutch oven after the steaming process and bake it directly on the rack.Do I really have to wait before cutting into it?Unfortunately, yes. The loaf continues to release moisture after being pulled from the oven, and if you slice into it while it\u2019s hot, you\u2019ll end up with a collapsed, gummy crumb. Better to wait at least an hour.Then slice it with this!This Is the Serrated Knife to End All Serrated KnivesIt won a gold medal in the Olympics of bread cutting.View StoryRecipes you want to make.
