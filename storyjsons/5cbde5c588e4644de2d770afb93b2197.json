The acclaimed lead of the Netflix films based on Jenny Han\u2019s novel To All The Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before, Condor has a passion that\u2019s infectious, whether it\u2019s for developing her own recipes or sleuthing the best poke in Seattle. Now starring in To All the Boys: Always and Forever, Condor talks about the magical powers of soup\u2014 and more.Do you have a color scheme that you like to follow in your table settings?I really just love matte, muted blues. I love that for my dishes. And then I like to have one statement serving dish in a different color. I recently got this Dutch oven that\u2019s so great. It\u2019s a beautiful pot that was gifted to me by Jenny Han, who wrote To All the Boys. It\u2019s from Great Jones and it\u2019s just a delicious evergreen color. It\u2019s not so heavy that you can\u2019t just pop it on the table. I like to put it in the center. That\u2019s where I\u2019ll have my soup so everyone can just ladle it out of there.Great Jones's 'The Dutchess' Dutch Oven$155 at Great JonesYou can invite anyone dead or alive, fictional or real, to this Dream Dinner Party. Who do you pick?Professor Snape of Harry Potter because I wonder how he has spent a good portion of his life keeping such an intense secret? As someone who has a hard time keeping secrets myself, it\u2019s mind-boggling to me that he could live with two faces so convincingly. Meals open people up in ways that they might not be expecting. Through my cooking, he would let his guard down and we could see a little of his heart.What would you cook him?I\u2019ve never met a bowl of soup that doesn\u2019t feel like a hug. So I would make him this awesome soup that I love to make whenever I\u2019m feeling down. The soup would say: \u201cListen, not all kids are bad. I got you.\u201d For him, I'd serve it in a cauldron.What\u2019s in this soup you\u2019ve developed?It\u2019s a coconut-cream-based soup that also has a little chicken broth, mirepoix, and a sweet Italian sausage that I crumble up and get nice and toasty, plus some fingerling potatoes and a huge handful of kale. I crisp up bacon for garnish. It\u2019s very easy.Just you and Snape?I\u2019d invite my brother. Like me, he was adopted. I have always wanted to have a deeper discussion about his feelings on adoption. Maybe he\u2019d think that if this badass Snape is opening up, then he can do it too.So it\u2019s you, Snape, and your brother around a cauldron of soup? What else do you serve?My brother isn\u2019t an adventurous eater. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever had coconut cream in his life. So I would make pizza. We all got into baking new things during quarantine and for me it was pizza dough. (I\u2019m still working on sourdough\u2014I\u2019m a little freaked out about it.) I would love to make him a delicious thin-crust pizza with mozzarella from King\u2019s Mozzarella at Ballard Farmers Market in Seattle. I\u2019d also serve homemade dumplings filled with a meat and herb medley. Dessert wine and a marionberry pie from Whidbey Pies to finish. I grew up with this pie and eat it during every special occasion.Let\u2019s say the dinner party is a hit: Snape reveals his inner heart and your brother opens up. Where do you go the next day to take a day off from cooking?There is a tiny little run-of-the-mill-looking convenience store called 45th Stop N Shop & Poke Bar. You wouldn\u2019t even give it a second glance. They have Japanese snacks, seaweed, gyoza, sake, and the best poke I\u2019ve ever had in my life. They don\u2019t give you options other than: Do you want rice or salad? and Which freshly caught fish do you want? You don\u2019t get to pick and choose the toppings. I have a lot of respect for people who know their dish is that good.Explore Bon App\u00e9titDream Dinner PartyRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
