They are two 9-inch rounds made of dark metal, and I purchased them about a decade ago. The nonstick coating is scratched moderately on one, badly on the other. If you apply enough pressure, you can flex the bottoms in and out, like the lid of a Ball jar. On one, there\u2019s a thin fuzz of rust that that I\u2019ve tricked myself into thinking is stuck-on chocolate cake.Am I you? Are you me? If so, join me in admitting that it\u2019s time to let go. While my pans technically still perform their intended function, they\u2019re not doing me any favors\u2014and when it comes to baking layer cakes, I need all the favors I can get. This week, as I prepare to tackle this Cardamom-Pistachio Carrot Cake as part of the Basically Guide To Better Baking, I\u2019m upgrading to the best cake pan around, Fat Daddio\u2019s.\u201cFat Daddio\u2019s are the gold standard,\u201d says Basically editor Sarah Jampel, only slightly mortified by having to say the words \u201cFat Daddio\u201d aloud. \u201cThey\u2019re what restaurants and commercial bakeries use, and they\u2019re really heavy duty so they\u2019ll heat evenly and last you a long time.\u201d Fat Daddio\u2019s pans are made of light-colored anodized aluminum. Since dark pans heat more quickly than light pans, using a Fat Daddio\u2019s ensures that the outside of your cake doesn\u2019t cook too quickly, which can result in a burnt-crust-underbaked-middle situation. And their non-reactive coating means you can bake a citrus upside-down cake in it without fear of it tasting metallic.Round cake pans lead to, well, round cakes!\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesSohla El-Waylly, who developed the carrot cake recipe, uses Fat Daddio\u2019s pans exclusively\u2014and not just in the Test Kitchen. She says, \u201cMy husband and I baked our wedding cake in them. It was five tiers, and each tier had eight cake layers and was about a foot tall. It was too much cake. But those pans are fantastic!\u201d If Fat Daddio\u2019s are good enough for Sohla to entrust with FORTY LAYERS of her own wedding cake, they are certainly good enough for the two birthday cakes I bake a year. (If you\u2019re curious like I was: It was s'mores flavored. \u201cI regret that,\u201d says Sohla, \u201cbut I did not have the sophisticated palate I have now.\u201d)Even if you\u2019re not a regular cake baker, Sarah argues that a round pan\u2019s versatility makes it a kitchen essential. \u201cNothing is stopping you from baking brownies or lemon bars in a round pan,\u201d she explains, \u201cand with a little math you can bake loaf cakes in a cake round, too.\u201d I even pull my busted pans out when I need to roast a small handful of nuts. They\u2019ve served me well. But now it\u2019s time to upgrade.Photo by Laura MurrayFat Daddio's Round Cake Pan, 9 x 3 Inch$14 at AmazonExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasically BakingCakeShoppingRecipes you want to make.
