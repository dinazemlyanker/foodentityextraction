Morning buns every morning, apple galettes every night, won\u2019t we be warm and cozy! Well guess what. Winter isn\u2019t coming: It\u2019s here, and the enthusiasm that once inspired you to lug your stand mixer down from the top of the fridge is gone, replaced by laundry bags overflowing with long underwear and an intolerance for the word \"cozy.\"It\u2019s easy to get lost in this despair. But despair not, because a trip to The Tropics is just around the corner, baby. That\u2019s right: hyper not-local but very much in-season Tropical Fruit is here to delight your dinner party guests and save you all from seasonal affective disorder. (It's best not to dwell on the fact that, somewhere far, far away, the weather is warm enough to ripen things on trees right now. Just buy the fruit and don't ask too many questions.)Photo by Alex LauSpears of vibrant, overly-ripe mango, rings of juicy papaya, neon pink hunks of \u201cwhat-is-that?\u201d (it\u2019s dragon fruit and it\u2019s pretty awesome), served with a lightly sweetened 50/50 whipped cream-Greek yogurt mixture for dipping and spooning and fun-having will have you transported to a sunnier place, forgetting all about the gray nightmare that is February. This dumb-simple setup is winter's answer to summer's best and simplest dessert\u2014ripe farmers' market berries and a plop of whipped cream\u2014and if anybody looks at you funny when you bring that platter of sweet, sweet fruit to the table, their expression will change as soon as they slurp down their first slice of ripe, tangy pineapple.The whole things takes about as much effort as you have to give this month\u2014which is to say, almost none at all\u2014and it\u2019s a great time of year to embrace the part of you that\u2019s always wondered what a horned melon tastes like.
