When something's so easy to make that you don't even need one. Welcome to It's That Simple, a column where we talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks we can make with our eyes closed.Some recipes are complicated and take three Dutch ovens and two baking sheets and four days of your time. But what I\u2019m about to share isn\u2019t one of those. It\u2019s uncomplicated, meant for those times when you haven\u2019t got a lot, physically or mentally, and it comes together from the bits and bobs of the fridge. Welcome to Caesar beans.First, the origin story: In normal times, I\u2019m cooking for me, myself, and I, and so a pot of beans lasts, well, a looong time. Okay, we\u2019re talking a week. But a week is a long time for me. As someone who\u2019s never been a huge leftovers fan, I\u2019m burdened with coming up with a new way to eat beans every day, and it feels...stressful? (I overthink things as you can see.) I\u2019ll toss them in pasta or mash them on toast, but that last remaining portion always escapes me.That is, it did\u2014until I saw the old-yogurt container of beans sitting right next to a tiny jar filled with another perennial leftover: Caesar salad dressing. BA\u2019s Best Caesar Salad is a no-fail recipe that produces a perfect dressing, but never have I once finished the entire volume of dressing it instructs you to make. Usually, I\u2019ll use the leftover dressing for new salads or more likely, dunking pizza crust. But when I realized that the two leftovers could join forces\u2014the dressing giving those boring beans a chance at life anew\u2014that was when I fully appreciated the power of a good Caesar. .Here\u2019s what you do:Make a big pot of beans (I like cranberry, chickpeas, or any kind of white bean like cannellini) and the dressing from BA\u2019s Best Caesar Salad. Toss the two together in any amount you like\u2014I don\u2019t know the extent of your leftover beans or dressing so I can\u2019t give you exact measurements, but you want the beans to be nicely coated but not drowning.Next, slice up some raw veggies like the random carrot you found at the back of your crisper, the radish you only bought because it was pretty, and maybe the last remaining head of endive. Toss those through to coat them in dressing, too!Then heat up a glug of olive oil and toast some panko breadcrumbs. Pour the toasty bread crumbs over your beans, then microplane the last nug of parm on top, too. Add any kind of pepper you\u2019d like\u2014aleppo-style, urfa biber, crushed red pepper flakes, black pepper\u2014it\u2019ll all taste good and you need a little somethin\u2019 to cut all of the richness of the beans and parm.That\u2019s it! Toasting the bread crumbs makes it feel like you\u2019re not just eating cold leftovers, and all of the olive oil in the Caesar dressing reminds you this is still a pretty stellar meal.See?
