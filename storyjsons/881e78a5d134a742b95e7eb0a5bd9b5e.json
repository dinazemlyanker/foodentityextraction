I included items such as how to fight with words, which rules are breakable, how to break them unnoticed, and how to be the kind of Mexican who people forget is Mexican at all.I realize now, three years later, that this list\u2014and how I conceived of it\u2014is flawed, born out of fear rather than indignation, a desire to hide from the world\u2019s events rather than resist them. If I were to write out a new list, it would be much different. And it would start with how to make tacos.After the climate strikes and local protests against Trump\u2019s Muslim bans and his draconian immigration policies, after shouting and marching in the streets of Lexington, Kentucky, and Williamstown, Massachusetts, cooking might seem like a weak form of resistance, or like no form at all. But as far as I\u2019m concerned, teaching my kids how to cook\u2014not just any food, but Mexican food, and not just any Mexican food, but the kind of slipshod Tex-Mex my mother made for me and my sister when we were kids\u2014might be the strongest form of resistance I can give them. This food reminds them where they come from, who they are, and, more importantly, to be proud of who they are. Because without this pride, resistance\u2014the kind of sustained resistance we need now\u2014is almost impossible to maintain.Maybe here you could formulate a metaphor: The ever-present taco\u2014adaptable, crowd-pleasing, resilient, pliable\u2014made with ingredients as simple as beans and rice, or as extravagant as scallops or ribeye or fried chicken strips and gravy or Korean barbecue and kimchi. Fold a tortilla around practically any ingredient and suddenly that combination becomes a taco. Maybe that\u2019s like Mexicans too: ever-present, adaptable, resilient. But if I told my kids this, they\u2019d roll their eyes or stare blankly. They\u2019d say, \u201cYou\u2019re being weird again, Dad.\u201d So instead, I\u2019ve decided to teach them to cook.I\u2019m not sure which night the lessons began. Maybe the one after Trump told Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to \u201cgo home\u201d (she was born in New York). Maybe the one when we found out a sixth child died in custody at the border. It\u2019s hard to say; they all start to bleed together. But on this night, we start simply: ground beef tacos. The boy, who is nine, is on stirring-and-pouring duty. Stir these beans on the stove, pour this salt into the picante. The kitchen smells like my mother\u2019s, the mingling garlic and onions and comino. I give my son a wooden spoon and show him how to break up the ground beef sizzling in the skillet. The girl chops onions. I\u2019m nervous when she grabs the knife\u2014she\u2019s loosey-goosey with it, the way that gangly 13-year-olds are prone to be\u2014but she does not slip.\u201cPerfect,\u201d I tell her, as she slides them gently into the skillet to brown.Fresh into teenagerhood, my daughter is very aware of this strange political moment. When we lived in Kentucky, she stood up to the fifth-grade boys in her classroom practically every day. She argued against cruelty, against injustice. She argued for protecting the most vulnerable in society: immigrants, refugees, the poor. She argued so fiercely, the boys began scratching her name off any list they found it on\u2014whiteboards, class rosters. It was their way of trying to silence her, I suppose. It was a difficult year, but not once did she back down or silence herself when it came to what she believed was right.My son, though still in elementary school, is not far behind. But I worry that, while my kids grasp the large-scale problems of this moment in our country\u2019s history and are willing to go to the mat for their beliefs, they don\u2019t understand the singular bearing this moment has on them, specifically. I worry they don\u2019t realize that what the president says about Mexicans\u2014that we\u2019re rapists and drug dealers and thugs\u2014he\u2019s saying about them too.I made a mistake three years ago, wanting my kids to be the kind of Mexicans people forget are Mexican. Being Mexican is one of my favorite things about me, about us. Mexicans are loving, caring, full of grit. We have a dark sense of humor, an ability to laugh and cry in the same breath. We know how to hustle. And the most Mexican thing about me is the food I cook, which is the same food my mother learned to cook from her mother. Teaching my kids to do it too is my way of telling them, \u201cLook, people didn\u2019t want your great-grandmother here, and some of those same people didn\u2019t want your grandmother here, and some of those same people don\u2019t want us here either, but here we still are. This is our food, and we are still us.\u201dOn this particular night, whichever night it was, the meat is cooked and ready. After chopping onions, our daughter made the guacamole and our son stirred some more. I did the rest. The kids\u2019 attention spans are limited and they quickly got bored of the process, the waiting. But when we bring the food to the table, they both chime in: \u201cWe helped.\u201dWe sit and eat and laugh and talk about school and what we want to do this weekend. We talk about things that make us happy and safe. We talked about how good these tacos are. We don\u2019t talk about Trump. And that\u2019s resistance too.Manuel Gonzales is the author of The Miniature Wife and Other Stories, which won the Sue Kaufman Prize for First Fiction and the John Gardner Prize for Fiction, and the novel, The Regional Office is Under Attack!
