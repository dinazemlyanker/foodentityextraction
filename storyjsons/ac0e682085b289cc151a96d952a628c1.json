It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.A wise man (I mean, my therapist) once told me that Mother\u2019s Day is not a day when I\u2019m supposed to make my mom feel special. It\u2019s actually a holiday designed for my husband to make ME feel special. I feel less guilty already!That said, Dear Husband, the rules for this Sunday are simple. Don\u2019t wake me up. Don\u2019t make me go to brunch. Don\u2019t watch me eat breakfast in bed. Instead, the minute my eyes delicately flutter open on their own, bring me a cup of my own recipe for masala chai tea. And then leave, because I would like to enjoy the quiet time.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!I\u2019d also like to be alone with the tea because I actually don\u2019t really enjoy sharing. I think that most mothers\u2014after sacrificing their bodies, their sleeping hours, and their sanity\u2014will agree that sharing, in general, is overrated. So just put the tea down on the bedside table and walk backward out of the room. Quietly.This masala chai has intense nostalgic value for me, but all mothers will love it. It is richly caffeinated\u2014moms love caffeine. It is sweetened, but not too much, and it\u2019s spicy from fresh ginger\u2014a reminder that life as a mom is sweet but there\u2019s also a kick. Or actually there\u2019s a catch, which is that being a mother means being plagued by worry and having to accept the fact that the people you created may sneeze directly into your mouth when they\u2019re sick. Spicy indeed!Making the masala chai takes 15 minutes, so the mother in your life will know that you made an effort, which is a thoughtful acknowledgement of her work. It would be nice if the children prepared cards expressing adoration, but it is more important that you preheat the cup by rinsing it with hot water so that the tea stays hot longer. When she\u2019s finished with her tea, she\u2019ll let you know. Until then: volume down please. It\u2019s the mother\u2019s day.Get the recipe:BA's Best Masala ChaiView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterMother's DayRead MorecookingMake This Strawberry-Granola Crisp for Mother\u2019s DayBy Deb PerelmancookingThe Mother\u2019s Day Steak I\u2019m Making My Mom, the Only Gift That MattersBy Christina ChaeycultureIt Never Occurred to Me to Have Cooking Shoes, Now I Can\u2019t Cook Without ThemBy Alex BeggscookingWhite Pesto Is The Easiest Dinner You Will Make This WeekBy Emma WartzmanRecipes you want to make.
