Canned beans are rightfully celebrated as a shelf-stable, inexpensive, versatile source of protein. Throw them into chili! Fold \u2019em into a luxuriously creamy vegan pasta sauce! Blend \u2019em into hummus! Smash \u2019em into sandwiches. The possibilities are just about endless. But sometimes, we do away with the theatrics and just marinate them. \u00a0Marinating\u2014a.k.a. popping the can, rinsing the beans, and drowning them in olive oil (plus any aromatics, herbs, and spices you have on hand)\u2014is a quick and adaptable upgrade that requires very little from you and your pantry. It also doubles as a great way to stretch any herbs and vegetables that might be on their way out: A slick of oil prevents oxidation, meaning you can keep those beans in the fridge for days, where they\u2019ll make for a hearty and healthful work lunch, a tasty-at-room-temp picnic food, or a speedy party appetizer. They are versatile enough to be enjoyed warmed up over toast or cold from the fridge and tossed in a sturdy salad.While you don\u2019t need more than a few glugs of good olive oil and vinegar to start marinating, white beans like cannellini, navy, or Great Northern can take on a wide range of assertive flavors that will only get better with time. Go ahead and improvise with what you have on hand, but keep these tenets in mind:Bloom your spicesStart by heating your olive oil in a medium skillet. This isn\u2019t the place to skimp on the fat, which will carry the flavor of your spices and alliums and give the beans a more luxurious mouthfeel: Aim for about \u2153 cup oil per two 15-oz. cans of beans.\u00a0Next up, add a few types of spices\u2014try whole spices like mustard seeds, fennel seeds, cumin seeds, chile flakes, or nigella seeds and/or ground spices or blends like coriander, smoked paprika, five-spice, or za\u2019atar\u2014and cook, stirring frequently, until they begin to pop or, in the case of ground spices, become darker and more fragrant. Whole spices will add bursts of crunchy flavor, whereas ground spices will coat each and every bean. In both instances, blooming the spices in fat not only unlocks their deepest, most aromatic flavors but also infuses the oil itself.This is also a good time to add any woody herbs\u2014like rosemary or thyme\u2014as well as bay leaves, curry leaves, or large peels of citrus zest.Brightland Olive Oil Duo$74 at BrightlandThen add aromaticsOnce your spices are bloomed in oil, pull them off the heat and grate in garlic and citrus zest (as opposed to sizzled peel, fresh zest will provide a more direct citrus punch\u2014the small particles disperse throughout the beans itself). Add your favorite allium, like finely chopped shallots, red onions, leeks, chives, or scallions.Break out the beansWhile you could make beans from dry for this, canned work just as well (and are a whole lot faster). Drain and rinse those canned beans (this is a scenario in which you don\u2019t want that gloppy goop). We particularly like white beans in this application\u2014their mild, buttery flavor means that they can accommodate a wide array of accessories\u2014but other varieties of beans (black, pinto, cranberry, etc.) will also work well.\u00a0Whichever beans you choose, add them to a heatproof bowl\u2014or, if you\u2019re planning to save them in the fridge for later, a heatproof storage container. To the beans, you can also add other ingredients that like to be marinated\u2014olives, cubes of feta, hunks of goat cheese, roasted peppers, roasted garlic cloves.\u00a0Pour the oil and spices on top of the beans while the fat is still hot in order to imbue them with the most flavor while simultaneously softening them up.\u00a0Don\u2019t forget fresh herbsA shower of bright herbs will add a layer of freshness. If possible, aim to use at least \u00bc cup of finely chopped tender herbs (like mint, parsley, cilantro, chives, and/or dill) per can of beans.Up the crunch factorTextural variation keeps beans from entering mush territory. Any sturdy, crisp produce you\u2019ve got in the back of your fridge can lend a satisfying bite: chopped celery, shredded brussels sprouts or Napa cabbage, sliced radishes, finely chopped fennel (use those fronds as your herb component!), sugar snap peas. Or turn to your pantry: Add toasted breadcrumbs, panko, or, for a fatty-toasty hit of flavor, roasted and roughly chopped nuts like pistachios, walnuts, or almonds.\u00a0Add something (anything!) acidicJust as if you were making a vinaigrette, you need acid to balance all of that oil with something sharp and tangy. A few splashes of fruity vinegar\u2014white wine, sherry, or apple cider\u2014will do the trick, as will lemon juice or any number of briny condiments. Think capers, yuzu kosho, peperoncini, chopped pickled green beans. Seize this opportunity to excavate the contents of your fridge, and all of those jars of leftover pickle brine, olive brine, and preserves.Deploy in different waysThe next time you\u2019re debating what to eat for lunch or dinner, let that jar of marinated beans do the heavy lifting for you. Bulk up a leafy salad or grain bowl\u2014in this Radicchio, Bean, and Feta salad, the marinade becomes the dressing. Or add some beans to a taco or pile them atop toast smeared with ricotta. Take them into dip territory\u2014scoop up with chips or crackers\u2014or toss through pasta or pasta salad. Or, just transfer those beans to a big bowl, add a fork, and dig in\u2014no extra cooking required. Since the flavors meld as they sit, these beans will be even better the next day\u2014a true gift to your future self, if you can manage to leave any uneaten.Marination nation:Radicchio, Bean, and Feta SaladThe solution to legume doom: This citrusy marinated bean salad with crunchy greens and big chunks of salty feta.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBeancookingRead MoreCoronavirus5 Ways to Zhoosh Up the Sweet Potatoes in Your PantryBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
