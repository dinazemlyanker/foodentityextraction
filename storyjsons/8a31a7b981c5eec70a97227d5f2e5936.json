(Although great coffee doesn\u2019t hurt, either.) A restaurant, on the other hand, is defined by the caliber of its food and wine.But what about bridging the two\u2013\u2013an all-day eatery with the affable charm of the best caf\u00e9s and the culinary chops of a proper restaurant? It\u2019s a distinctly Australian sort of concept, and one that three Australian gentlemen\u2013\u2013Banter co-founders, Nick Duckworth and Josh Evans, and executive chef, Jake Hawkins\u2013\u2013have brought to Manhattan. It's a philosophy that defines both Banter in the West Village and Sonnyboy on the Lower East Side, opened just this year with co-founder Stefano D\u2019Orsogna.From LEFT to RIGHT: Josh Evans, Nick Duckworth and Jake Hawkins\nCourtesy of Banter Works\u201cWe\u2019re about friendly service and fun, accessible food and drink at an affordable price,\u201d says Evans. \u201cI think that\u2019s the gap in the whole New York restaurant scene at the moment, and we\u2019re trying to make the most of that opportunity.\u201dDuckworth, originally from Sydney, and Evans, raised in Melbourne, met in New York, managing the two locations of the Australian-inspired Two Hands. \u201cWe struck up a friendship,\u201d says Evans, \u201cand we knew we wanted to do our own thing.\u201d Six months later, they found a West Village space, and Banter was born as a daytime caf\u00e9. A year later, the two met chef Jake Hawkins, and saw that his culinary talent could only expand Banter\u2019s appeal, allowing them to launch a more ambitious evening menu.\u201cJake brought fine dining talent to Banter,\u201d says Evans. \u201cBut we don\u2019t do it in a fine dining environment.\u201d Even as Hawkins upped their culinary cred, they wanted Banter to remain an easygoing neighborhood favorite, a friendly local that regulars could pop in anytime.This hybrid caf\u00e9-restaurant\u2013\u2013or, perhaps, a caf\u00e9 that\u2019s evolved the sophistication of a restaurant \u2013\u2013felt familiar to these three Aussies. For more than a decade, according to Evans, Australia has had a robust coffee scene. \u201cCaf\u00e9s and caf\u00e9 culture have been strong for years,\u201d he shares, driven both by third-wave coffee culture and Australia\u2019s robust Italian population with their own, more traditional coffee scene. \u201cIn some ways, we modernized it,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it was all complemented by the fresh food and produce we have in Australia.\u201dAt the same time, workplaces were becoming less formal, with many people looking to take meetings outside the office and use caf\u00e9s as a sort of home base. There was a healthy market for relaxed, all-day venues that happened to serve excellent meals. \u201cOver time, it really grew into something,\u201d says Evans. \u201cYou\u2019ll see meetings during the week, families on the weekends. And the food\u2019s only gotten better. Some caf\u00e9s back home really are more like restaurants now, reinventing themselves.\u201dAnd it was clear, in their minds, that New York was ripe for such an establishment.Hawkins\u2019s approach to the menus reflects his Australian roots\u2013\u2013which is to say, it\u2019s inherently international and delightfully experimental. \u201cThere\u2019s not one thing that defines Australian food,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re a young country, with migration from so many cultures. We\u2019re not held down by tradition, hammering away in dedication to a traditional art.\u201dTheir own art is in embracing what\u2019s exciting, interesting, and unexpected. And in embracing quality, according to Evans. \u201cWe find what\u2019s fresh and delicious, and put it on the menu.\u201dCase in point: Banter\u2019s burrata dish, with asparagus, radicchio, and currants agrodolce. \u201cYou can see multiple international influences just on that plate,\u201d says Hawkins. \u201cIn a way it\u2019s Italian, but it\u2019s new-age and exciting and different.\u201dBanter\u2019s Burrata Dish\nCourtesy of Banter WorksOr the beef tartare, which nods to tradition while maintaining its own point of view. \u201cWe can all admit that a whole raw egg yolk is a bit gross,\u201d Hawkins says. \u201cSo we use a confit garlic aioli, with fresh horseradish on top, and shaved raw cashews, which create the creamy texture you\u2019d get from egg yolk. If one person orders it, everyone at the table will eat it.\u201d Novel, yet unintimidating.\u201cWhenever I make a new dish, I want to make sure my mum can eat it when she comes,\u201d Hawkins laughs. It\u2019s a true reflection of their ethos\u2013\u2013unconventional and approachable in equal measures.That enthusiasm for the unexpected extends to their wine philosophy, as well. \u201cWe have so many open-minded winemakers in Australia,\u201d says Hawkins, citing trailblazers including Mac Forbes, Airlie Bank, Delinquente Wine Co., and Ben Haines. \u201cWe have the opportunity to grow as a culinary scene alongside these winemakers. It\u2019s incredibly exciting.\u201dAt a recent Sunday Roast meal, Sonnyboy featured the wines of the unconventional Mac Forbes, \u201cwho\u2019s breaking away from commercial winemaking tradition,\u201d says Duckworth. In choosing wines to serve alongside the four-course meal, they wanted to take a few creative liberties, eschewing basic pairing rules in favor of playing around with pure flavor. \u201cWe\u2019re not afraid to do that,\u201d says Hawkins.The Mac Forbes Yarra Valley Chardonnay, for instance, echoed many flavors in the burrata dish, not necessarily presenting a pure contrast, while still cutting against the burrata\u2019s creaminess. \u201cWe played with the whole Australian new-age way of thinking.\u201dHawkins is a particular fan of Ben Haines and his natural wines. \u201cHe has the kind of underdog story that\u2019s common in Australia. I think we\u2019ll hear a lot more about him.\u201d While he admires the winemaker\u2019s radical approach of minimal-intervention natural wines that buck tradition, he doesn\u2019t need a sommelier-level understanding of a given wine to be inspired by what\u2019s in the glass.\u201cI drink it, and I feel some way about how to wrap the menu around it,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat excites me is how it doesn\u2019t taste like, say, French wine.\u201dIt\u2019s an appreciation for the unconventional, the respectful disregard of tradition, and the willingness to go a little rogue that defines Banter and Sonnyboy, and the wines the three men love. And, of course, creating a genuinely welcoming space that\u2019s free of attitude. At the end of the day, \u201cit\u2019s a relaxed place with a fun vibe,\u201d says Duckworth. \u201cWe want you to come in and feel comfortable, like you\u2019re at someone\u2019s home.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what Australia is all about,\u201d Hawkins agrees. \u201cWe make our cuisine fun, easy and interesting, which, in a way, gives us more time to enjoy the food and wine. With family and with friends. It\u2019s all about having a good time.\u201dRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
