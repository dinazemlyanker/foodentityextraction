It is I, a cool and relevant elder Millennial who knows lots of things about trends and slang. I own a lime-green eyeshadow from a DTC beauty company. Yesterday I complimented someone on their Jibbitz. So I was flattered but not surprised when our lifestyle editor asked me to write Bon Appetit\u2019s year-end roundup of TikTok food trends, seeing as how I have my \u201cfinger\u201d on the \u201cpulse\u201d of this cultural moment.I did have one slight hesitation. I\u2019m not on TikTok. I have seen TikTok videos, of course\u2014mostly via Instagram or the platform\u2019s terrible desktop interface or this SNL documentary. Many creators are doing delicious, bizarre, wonderful things with food on the platform, and I work with at least one very talented person who is legitimately TikTok famous. And yet I remain unclear on whether the word TikTok is a noun, adjective, verb, or all of the above. I\u2019m on top of FoodTok in the same way that I\u2019m on top of professional sports\u2014if I need to talk to your uncle about the Jets, I can do so for five minutes before I run out of material. And so, I present to you a very official critique of 2021\u2019s TikTok food trends, written by someone who uses earbuds with a cord. (Wait, is that in again?)Pesto eggsThis one is clever! Without having tried this hack, I imagine that there\u2019s enough oil in pesto to sub in for a knob of butter or a glug of olive oil, with the added bonus of bright herby flavor and a little frico action from the cheese. Would still recommend a nonstick skillet, but I\u2019d try it. Nine out of 10 TikToks (it\u2019s a scientific unit of measurement now too). Points off because that yolk is a little too done for my taste.TikTok contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Drinking chlorophyll water for \u201cwellness\u201dThis probably won\u2019t kill you, but as a general rule, let\u2019s not start ingesting supplements based on internet videos, yeah? Could we not just...eat spinach? Looks pretty, seems scammy, two out of 10 TikToks.Cooking in the woods, as ASMRI don\u2019t get brain tingles from ASMR, but I did find this deeply satisfying. In an alternate reality where I\u2019m on TikTok, the thing I like most about the platform is the feeling of being transported to locations very different from my own. Plaudits for strong knife skills (that ginger brunoise?) and the cleavers-as-tongs trick. An enthusiastic 10 out of 10 TikToks.Adding protein to coffeeCan we leave coffee alone? Wasn\u2019t it fine without ghee and protein powder? I don\u2019t support, but I also don\u2019t think this one is TikTok\u2019s fault\u2014let\u2019s blame protein bros and the \u201cwellness\u201d industry. One out of 10 TikToks.TikTok contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Baked feta pastaFifty years from now, will baked feta pasta define our cultural moment in the same way that fondue did for the \u201970s or flourless chocolate cake did for the \u201990s? To me, this seems like the quintessence of FoodTok\u2014there\u2019s a hacky element, you need little to no cooking expertise, and it\u2019s intensely cravable. Eight out of 10 TikToks.Emily Mariko\u2019s salmon riceI\u2019m on a roll, I know this one too! We wrote about Emily\u2019s favorite knives. I admit to being befuddled by the virality of this video. Unlike the feta pasta or sushi bake trends, there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything particularly novel about the recipe or preparation, but she seems nice, like maybe she\u2019d let me sit with her if I were new at school. Six out of 10 TikToks.Dipping slices of raw onion as \u201cchips\u201d in salsaPass.TikTok contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Adding dozens of garlic cloves to recipesMy grandfather was in the Les Blank film Garlic Is As Good As Ten Mothers (he\u2019s the Chinese chef who makes a chicken stir-fry while reciting a poem about his love of America and jogging), so the Garlic Girl trend speaks directly to my soul. Also, the roasted cloves being squeezed out of their compartments is very Dr. Pimple Popper\u2014extra credit. Eleven out of 10 TikToks.Inserting garlic up the, uh, noseWhile I believe in the healthful properties of garlic, per my last email, this I did not need to see. What\u2019s with the drums in the background? Chaos out of 10 Tik Toks.Putting the entire block of cream cheese into the CrockPotIs this why there\u2019s a cream cheese shortage? Can we hold CrockPot TikTok responsible? I give it a six.TikTok contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Butternut squash and roasted garlic pastaDon\u2019t know about this one. Cubed butternut squash, sliced mushrooms, and a halved onion are not going to all cook at the same time, and that sheet pan is crowded. I\u2019d invest in some quarter-sheet pans, young ma\u2019am. Four out of 10 TikToks.Whipped fetaSame person? She seems to be having a good year, I hope she\u2019s doing something nice for herself. I\u2019m starting to sense a FoodTok formula\u2014feta, cream cheese, roasted garlic extractions. The algorithm wants what it wants.Focaccia charcuterie boardVery aesthetic. Compared to some of the more aggressive ASMR videos, the audio is pleasingly spare\u2014good use of aural negative space. Deft with those tweezer tongs too. Seven out of 10 TikToks.TikTok contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Eating salad with chipsOh, damn, the tiny cupcake lady is disrupting the salad space? She\u2019s giving me tough-but-respected-high-school-soccer-coach energy. Also, she appears to have a very angry burn and/or wound on her left hand? Hope she\u2019s okay. Six-point-five.Eating pickled garlic from the jarThrilled for garlic, she really seems to be thriving on TikTok. The woman in this video sort of sounds like a sleepy auto-tuned baby, which I find oddly soothing. Eight out of 10 TikToks.Thousand-layer, 15-hour potatoThis potato mille-feuille is essentially the incredible \u201cbutter-roasted hash brown\u201d at Gage & Tollner in Brooklyn, which is a hash brown in the same way that the Grand Canyon is a hole in the ground.
