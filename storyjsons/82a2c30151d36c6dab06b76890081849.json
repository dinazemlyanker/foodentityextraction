For this version, we swapped in nutty, chewy black rice, took a tip from fried rice and crisped it up in the pan, and added lap cheong, a cured Chinese pork sausage with a maple-y sweetness. (If you can\u2019t find lap cheong, a maple-cured pork stick works as a substitute.) With crunchy peanuts, tender-juicy celery, and floral Fresno chiles to boot, it\u2019s a riot of textures and sweet-and-savory flavors that still plays nice with the rest of the spread. Now that\u2019s a side we can get behind for the holidays, or really, anytime of the year\u2014especially when it\u2019s topped with a fried egg.Ingredients8\u201310 servings as a side or 4\u20136 servings as a main2red Fresno chiles, finely chopped\u00bccup unseasoned rice vinegar2Tbsp. white miso1Tbsp. pure maple syrup7Tbsp. neutral oil (such as grapeseed, canola, or vegetable), divided4cups cooked black rice, chilled until cold (from 1\u00bd cups raw)\u00bdtsp. kosher salt, plus more6oz.

Add chilled rice and press into a flat, even layer. Cook, undisturbed, until underside is very crisp (take a peek and give it a feel; it should be crackly), 7\u20138 minutes. Break it up into a few large pieces, turn, and continue to cook until crispy all over, 3\u20134 minutes longer. Season rice with salt, then toss to break up crispy bits. Transfer to a large bowl.Step 3Cook sausages, sliced celery, and 1 Tbsp. oil in same skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until sausage and celery begin to brown in some parts, and celery is crisp-tender but not floppy, 3\u20134 minutes. Transfer sausage mixture to bowl with rice.Step 4Heat remaining 3 Tbsp. oil in same skillet over medium until very hot, about 1 minute. Add mushrooms and toss once or twice to coat in oil. Season mushrooms with \u00bd tsp. salt and cook, undisturbed, until browned underneath, 4\u20135 minutes. Toss and continue to cook, tossing occasionally, until softened and browned in more places, 3\u20134 minutes longer.Step 5Return rice mixture to skillet and cook, tossing occasionally, until warmed through, about 1 minute. Remove skillet from heat, stir in rice vinegar dressing and peanuts, and toss again to coat. Taste and season with more salt if needed.Step 6Transfer rice mixture to a platter.

Black rice was delicious. Added some extra veg (shredded Brussels sprouts, bit of ginger) and used beyond for the sausage so not 100% true to the recipe, but the fresno / vinegar / maple mixture with the black rice is what I think we're really talking about! Great flavor combo, peanuts totally worked too. Great leftovers next day too. kmarxmarxchicago, il7/10/2020Add lottts of celery!  So good!  \nI've made this with honey instead of maple and also got tasty results.  Meatless sausage breakfast patties actually worked well as a replacement for the meat but I think it could easily be made vegetarian by just using way more mushrooms as well.  \n\nAdded fresh grated ginger to the sauce and probably wouldn't make it without the ginger going forward.  I've added mandarin oranges or egg yolk to this and both are good additions!AnonymousColumbus1/3/2020I am obsessed with this. So yummy with the crisped rice and fatty sausage. Found it at my local Asian market!AnonymousBrooklyn11/26/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titStuffingSausageMeatShiitake MushroomMushroomVegetableRiceRice & GrainsFallSideMainDairy-FreeThanksgivingDinnerRecipes you want to make.
