I was impressed with how easy an trouble-free it was. I tend to only bake with whole wheat flour from a local bakery that mills their own flour, so that was a big plus. Took it over to a friend's house for a wine and cake session this afternoon, and we were all very happy with the results.Pat BittonEureka, CA9/23/2021I was nervous at first \u2014 when I started baking the room was drench in a umami odor and I thought: wow, way too much. But it mellowed out, I must say, this one is a winner. The miso paste adds just enough of a savory, umami flavor note to keep it from being a cloyingly-sweet cinnamon crumble. I would say this recipe is a successful, unique spin on a crumb cake. The only problem is that well, it\u2019s a crumb cake. So it\u2019s good every once in a while but not something I will make on a regular basis for myself, but it\u2019s a solid option if I make brunch for friends.\n\nA few notes:\n\n\u2014 I used 2tbsp of miso instead of 3.... the flavor is there, without being o too much. Next time I\u2019ll push it to maybe 2.5. However much you use, make sure you mix that crumble REALLY well into an evenly consistent powder. You want the miso is evenly distributed, no miso balls. This will make sure the flavors blend well.\n\n\u2014 Next time I\u2019ll up the blueberry content, or add a little more of a second berry like raspberry or blackberry. I wanted to taste more.\n\n\u2014 I used a 9inch spring form pan. Perfect results.Drew KNew York 3/31/2021Someone please tell me what I did wrong. I followed the recipe to a T using weights. Even to the point of using a damn 9inch cake pan (that, of course, overflowed and destroyed my clean oven) . The result was inedible. This cake manages to be dense, greasy, mushy and aggressively salty. I even cooled the stupid thing for 2 hours. Ick. I even kept it around and tried it the next morning. Ick. The following evening. Ick. So what did i do or not do and what am I supposed to do with a tub of $12 white miso?LaraNashville, TN2/2/2021This cake turned out great.  It is very lightly sweet, which I liked.  The whole wheat flour gives it a nice \"nutty\" flavor, but the texture is surprisingly moist. I followed the directions exactly, except that I only had red miso so I used that instead of white miso, but added to my taste (since red miso is saltier and funkier than white miso). I probably wound up adding 1.5-2 tablespoons. The crumb turned out great - slightly salty with a subtle umami flavor. I made sure to break it into relatively fine crumbs.MattNew York1/18/2021Great, super easy cake! I accidentally only put 1 stick of butter instead of 2 and I still loved it. I baked it in a 10 inch spring form and had no issue with overflow. If you like blueberry muffins with a sweet, salty, slightly savory crumb this is for you. The cake isn\u2019t sickly sweet, so it\u2019s perfect for breakfast or dessert. Anonymous1/10/2021This is not my favorite cake. I have baked it three times in the last two months. It is so good. My husband is diabetic and whole wheat flour is better than white for him. I will make it over and over.BarbaraJamaica, NY12/15/2020I just finished waiting for two hours to elapse so I could slice into this cake, which I was very excited to eat. I've never made a cake with all WW flour before, but this one scores one point for team Whole Wheat. I used a 9 inch cake pan, as the recipe specified-anything smaller won't fit all the batter. My miso crumble came together easily with a fork (room temp miso and warm butter mix better!) I tented it after 30 minutes but definitely would have been better off doing it at 20-25. Got a little dark. The inside isn't picturesque, but boy, it is delicious. Totally on the less sweet side. I'm curious as to how it will be after sitting 24 hours. I'm thinking about using apples as a seasonal sub?nataliematz88Omaha,NE10/11/2020This cake is incredible. The sweetness is perfectly balanced with the miso. I used a 10\u2019 spring form pan and it baked nicely. Be sure to fully incorporate your miso into your butter (microwave is your friend). Some friends said it was their favorite dessert they had eaten all year. AnonymousSeattle10/2/2020I should have checked my WW flour before mising out this recipe. Had to use regular AP but it turned out great. I did brown my butter instead of using regular melted butter and it smells fantastic. Planning on making it again with WW flour but with raspberries instead. AnonymousDenver Colorado9/18/2020Was just meh. Should have made it in a deep 9in pan or springform as there was way too much batter for a normal pan. Too much salty crumb. Thought it would lend a nice contrast but it was just weird. I think the cake without the topping would have been just fine though. Nice texture, just right on the sweetness. It was not good enough to put into rotation though. AnonymousPhiladelphia 9/18/2020This was delicious! The one thing I will do differently next time is let the miso get to room temp and whisk it into the melted butter before I add the dry ingredients for the crumb. I had some very strong/uneven miso notes in the crumb topping, and I think this would help fix that. AnonymousBrooklyn 9/16/2020It seems like this should have been good, but the whole wheat flour just made it so heavy. I like fluffy blueberry muffins and this was just too dense. I didn't have a round cake pan, so I used a 8x8 square. I didn't have any problems with baking. It looked great! Not to my taste though. carriespnc9/15/2020This cake was delicious. I added an extra 2 tbs of brown sugar. After reading the comments I baked the cake in a 10\" pan. My husband has diabetes and the whole wheat flour is better for him. I am going on a picnic and plan to make this cake.AnonymousNew York City9/11/2020Great cake and the miso really added a great depth of flavor! Make sure to put the cake on the lower racks so the crumb topping doesn't burn.Jennifer APasadena9/9/2020Made this recipe exactly as written and, as some other reviewers commented, the batter overflowed from the pan and created a horrible mess. The cake did not cook through and it turned out to be a nightmare. I was sooo surprised because I have always had luck with Bon Appetit recipes.
