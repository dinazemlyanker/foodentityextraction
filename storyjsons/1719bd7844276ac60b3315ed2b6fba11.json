Two ingredients. Promise.By Alex DelanyMarch 26, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsea Kyle, Food Styling by Jennifer OphirFacebookTwitterEmailI have a rather unique understanding of what constitutes successful home entertaining. Some might say it\u2019s all about elegance or luxury or consideration or taste. But me? I think it\u2019s about deception. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m a dishonest or deceitful host. I love my guests! But in my mind, the secret to a dinner party that is as enjoyable to host as it is to attend is presenting food that seems to be much more than it is, to create the illusion that you worked way harder than you actually did. It\u2019s all about the low-lift, high-payoff dishes\u2014ones with a high ROI (Return on Investment) for all you business-minded folks out there.In all the years that I've served these types of dishes at parties, I\u2019ve kept track of the most successful\u2014the all-stars of the low-lift lineup. And there is one dish that absolutely slays every single time I serve it, one that has earned a permanent spot on every cookout menu I will serve from now until the end of time. It is inarguably the world\u2019s greatest two-ingredient dish. I am talking, of course, about seared kielbasa and mustard.You might be thinking, Wow. I\u2019m reading an article about kielbasa and mustard. What's there to say about that? This guy really is all about deception, huh? I already know what I need to know about one of the world\u2019s great sausages!And that\u2019s fine. But the whole point is that you don't think about any of that when someone plops a plate of the good stuff down in front of you. Instead, you think something like, What?! Grilled kielbasa?! And mustard?! I want to combine them and eat them with my mouth right now! You don't think about how simple and dumb-easy that snack was to prepare. You just get excited.The combination is a textbook example of simplicity and balance on every level. If we\u2019re talking about texture, you have the crispy snap of the charred kielbasa casing, the firm, meaty interior, and the luxurious smoothness of that mustard. Such contrast! Flavor-wise, you have the the fattiness and smokiness of the sausage, paired with the tang and heat of the mustard. Such pleasure! Such perfection!And unlike most two-ingredient dishes, this one is truly two ingredients. There\u2019s no added salt. No cooking fat. No pepper. No optional herbs or fancy garnishes. There\u2019s kielbasa, and there\u2019s mustard. I can tell you how to make this dish in two sentences. Here you go:Cook the kielbasa on a grill or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat, until the casing is deeply browned and sausages are warm throughout, about five to seven minutes. Remove the kielbasa from heat, slice into coins, and serve them on a plate with a small bowl of mustard.You can spring for the good stuff or just grab whatever's at the grocery store. I promise both will be loved.\nLook at that. No lies there. I was 100 percent truthful regarding the simplicity of this dish. Could you do it differently? Sure. If you wanted to slice the sausage before you cook it and brown those coins individually for extra caramelization, go for it you little overachiever. But whichever way you prepare it, it's as easy to make as it is to love.But to my guests and yours, the simplicity of the dish is lost in the commotion of the appeal. No one is going to think about how easy it was to make. They\u2019ll be too busy going back for piece number two, three, four, and five. To me, this is what good entertaining is all about, creating a smokescreen of deliciousness that distracts from just how effortless the food was for you to prepare. And that's a kind of deception that nobody is going to get mad about.Need more kielbasa content?
