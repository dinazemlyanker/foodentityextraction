Followed exactly, with no substitutes except that I made 1/2 the portion as we're just two people.  It was my first time trying raw egg yolk in soup, and I really loved it.  It adds a nice richness to the broth and it's not slimy or anything once it's mixed in. So don't be afraid if you are trying it for the first time too.  \n\nNext time I'll add another clove of garlic to better suit my tastes. \n\nI did find the acorn skin kind of finicky to work around while eating, but it's not the end of the world. I might try to peel it first next time as well.  It's a great recipe just as written regardless.JessicaToronto2/7/2022Added enoki mushrooms and subbed seasoned soy beans (found at asian market) for cannelini beans. Eyeballed the measurements and added some fish sauce. OMG. Loved it, tasted restaurant quality. Also loved that it was filling without being heavy. Million stars.TaliaOntario12/23/2021We love this soup, especially as we make our own kimchi and usually have tons hanging around. I'm the only one who puts an egg in it, but the rest of my carnivorous family loves this meal despite no meat. DiDiSisters, OR2/24/2021This is my favorite soup. I usually use kabocha or delicata squash. I add fresh napa when reheating leftovers. I always add the raw yoke :) but have found that a poached egg works well if you can't do the raw...KristenSeattle, WA1/7/2021I make this dish all the time and it hits the spot with every variation I've made!Grace Y12/13/2020Put this together last Friday. Omitted onion, gochujang, and raw egg yolks because, personal preference. Subbed in delicata squash and dried red chile pepper flakes. Used a vegan low-sodium local-ish kimchi, Sunja's Medium Spicy made in Vermont. Added (my attempt at cutting) matchstick carrots. Otherwise followed recipe, including a generous thumb's worth of fresh ginger, six cloves of garlic, low-sodium vegan chick'n broth. DELICIOUS. Spicy and warming for a cold day. Of course, now it's 75 deg F outside. But the point is, this is a delicious soup and I'm glad I added the entire 16 oz jar of Sunja's kimchi. Now I'm got comforting hot lunches for the week. I'm sure this soup would also be lovely served over some hot short-grain brown rice. Thanks for this recipe - it's going into my longterm \"batch meals for the week\" rotation.Urbanite11/9/2020So good. Made it with delicate squash my first time and home made chicken stock!!!\n\n however- unless your veg, I don\u2019t recommend subbing the veggie for the chicken stock.. I did this on a whim and it really wasn\u2019t as good. I think you need the chicken to round out the acid of the onion and kimchi.\n\nDefinitely making it again- with chicken stock m. EmmcoopMontreal10/9/2020Didn't have acorn squash, so I made this with some grilled, diced zucchini. I added some extra diced carrot, and used fresh grated ginger. It was delicious. I plan on making it again. The zucchini was tasty, but the suggestion of delicata squash also sounds delightful. If you're looking for a kimchi brand that isn't super salty, my favorite brand  is Sunja's medium spicy, made in Vermont. It's low in sodium, vegan, but still flavorful and crisp.AnonymousBoston3/29/2020Delicious! Will definitely make again. Very easy and full of flavor. I\u2019m a vegetarian so I subbed the chicken stock with veggie broth and 1 better than boullion cube. Came out delicious! Hannah_KAtlanta, GA1/15/2020So many flavours! Sweet, sour, salty, hot spice \ud83d\ude0a The portions are large as your might expect from an Asian style soup. Easy to prepare. I think it would be very comforting if you had a head cold.\nThanks Andy!
