Half olive oil and half vegetable oil works better for me. Replace the tbsp of regular sugar with coarse turbinado sugar and you\u2019ve got a bit more texture on top. Thumbs up with these slight mods! Suzy Orange County CA1/13/2022Excellent! Won a pumpkin bread \"bake-off\" last weekend and it was quick to make. Really flavorful with the fresh gingerLindsayHouston, TX11/8/2021Amazing recipe, would make a again and amp up the ginger - both fresh and powder. I used a teaspoon of Maldon salt in the batter and it has the perfect salty / sweet ratio.ZeusFromTheCongoToronto, ON, Canada11/2/2021BEST pumpkin bread ever. love how it uses olive oil, not sure why John from FL said hes using canola. its delicious and Molly is a genius as always! love love love this recipe so much I make it even in non-fall... you won't overbake it its so moist, dont underbake!Anna WardSan Clemente CA10/28/2021I wish she had specified what brand of kosher salt she used! I used Windsor (same sodium content/saltiness as Morton) and it was WAY too salty. I'm usually on board for Molly's saltier dishes, but this was inedible \u2013 I ended up having to throw most of it out because no one in my family could eat it. I'm assuming she probably used Diamond Crystal, and if she'd specified that, I would've cut my salt in half. Also, even after my cake tester came out clean, it was partly undercooked inside and super mushy. I think there's too much of the wet ingredients \u2013 I'm all for a moist cake, but the texture of this was gross, and the sugar on top didn't caramelize so it was just super weird having that sprinkled on top. (My oven was definitely hot enough \u2013 I used a thermometer.)\n\nI really wanted to like this, so I'm going to try again with a few alterations. I'd definitely recommend cutting back on the salt (if using Morton or similar), oil, and sugar topping, and making sure you bake it at LEAST 90 min, even if you think it's done before then.AnonymousOttawa, ON9/30/2021I was underwhelmed at first, but the more I ate it, the more I liked it. I will skip the olive oil next time and use canola; I feel like the evoo made the bread taste stale much sooner. This loaf will last me a week or longer. I used one half a cup of oil. I prefer a drier crumb and knew 1 cup would be way too much for me. I used 1 cup of sugar and it was sweet enough for me. (I actually used half white/brown sugar, and a tablespoon of molasses). I added a minced apple which contributed moistness and added some 'acid'/tartness. I'll repeat the apple next time, I could definitely taste what it added. I used 3 eggs instead of 2; the eggs I had were small + I wanted a bit more nutrition in the loaf. I also added toasted walnuts.JohnFlorida2/25/2021This is the best Pumpkin Bread! This is the third year making it and it is perfect every time I bake it. I have made some tweeks, I chop up candied ginger, use 1/4 C. I also add pecans to it, it makes for a lovely bite. Do not pass on the Maple Butter, it is wonderful. I have used the butter to glaze cook carrots, there are endless possibilities!AnonymousDallas, TX12/24/2020Unbelievable!! I\u2019ve made this 5-6 times and it always comes out amazing and people beg me for the recipe. I don\u2019t find the olive oil flavor overpowering at all. The only change I make (and I know it\u2019s gonna sound crazy) is I add a ton more of each spice- like 3tsp cinnamon, 1/2tsp cloves, 2-3tbsp ginger, etc. I love a super pumpkin spice-y flavor and with the increase, this delivers. Also, the seeds on top add the perfect crunch- don\u2019t skip them! LinNew York 12/17/2020Not only was this super easy and quick to make, it was also fantastically delicious. I didn't have any olive oil, so I used coconut instead. Also, I didn't have any pumpkin seeds so I used chopped pecans on top. It's a tad on the sweet side, so cutting the sugar down to 1 cup may be a good idea based on your preference. 10/10!AnonymousMadison, WI12/1/2020The only adjustment I made to the recipe was using 1 cup instead of 1 1/2 cups of sugar since I read reviews that it was very sweet. The bread came out perfect! I was hesitant to use the olive oil, but I use a good quality one and it wasn't overpowering. The maple butter went well with the bread too. Anonymous11/25/2020This was really good. I just followed the directions without making any omissions or substitutions and it turned out perfect.AnonymousAnn Arbor, MI11/20/2020Delicious! Extremely moist but not too crumbly - perfect texture really. Very sweet, but great if you're looking for more of a dessert. I was afraid the olive oil flavor would be too strong, so I used a neutral oil. It's a very soft, wet dough, not very sticky. I also cooked it in a muffin tin instead of loaf pan and they made great \"muffins.\" Super yum.KatDenver, CO11/10/2020Made this yesterday and love it!! The only variance I made was to add nuts and seeds to the mix. I toasted walnuts, pecans and pumpkin seeds and then chopped them to a rough chop. I also sprinkled in some flax and chia seed. It did not affect the cooking time at all. I also skipped the maple butter. No bad olive oil after taste either. It is sweet, I made this to have for breakfast this week and think next time I will cut down on the sugar. It is a little too sweet for breakfast. Sabra ReddenAnna, Texas 11/9/2020I made this pumpkin bread without the maple butter and it was amazing. I shared it with friends and family and everyone was very impressed. I then decided to try and make banana bread with the same recipe. (I used 4 over ripe bananas instead of pumpkin pur\u00e9e & slivered almonds instead of pumpkin seeds) This was by far the best banana bread I have ever made. I will be sharing this recipe with friends and family! Thank you! AnonymousPA11/8/2020So delicious! I skipped the maple butter because it's plenty sweet on its own, very good with a little regular salted butter. Next time I might try cutting down the sugar just a bit so I can taste the pumpkin more. Definitely very moist, the olive oil is perfect. callasliliesSan Francisco11/5/2020Explore Bon App\u00e9titLoaf CakeCakeDessertBreadAmericanPumpkinSquashVegetableGingerHerbs & SpicesCinnamonNutmegFallSnackVegetarianBakingRecipes you want to make.
