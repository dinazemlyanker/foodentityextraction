See our past recommendations here!In this era of outdoor dining, my picnic basket (read: oversized tote bag) is always ready to go. Whether I\u2019m eating takeout tetelas in a shady park patch or sipping sours on a concrete-covered roof, I\u2019m going to need a few essentials: bug spray, a bottle opener, and some bamboo plates to divvy up the bounty.For decades melamine has been the de facto material for lightweight picnic tableware. But a new crop of bamboo offerings from Toronto-based design brand Xenia Taler and L.A.-based design hub Poketo make a compelling case for branching out into new textures. The cheery patterns\u2014tangerine terrazzo, peachy gingham, indigo triangles\u2014instantly upgrade any alfresco situation, even if your picnic spot is just your fire escape.My newfound devotion to bamboo goes far beyond aesthetics: The fast-growing grass is more sustainable than plastic-derived melamine but just as crack-proof. Unlike my precious ceramic shallow bowl, which I live in constant fear of shattering, I can use these plates all day without a single heart palpitation. If I had a dishwasher, I\u2019d toss them in there without blinking an eye. And if they do break, the biodegradable bamboo is ideal for the compost bin.Picnic purists may point out that Labor Day is behind us, but I won\u2019t let the calendar dictate my social plans\u2014I\u2019ll keep a stack of these bamboo plates in my bag through October, though I\u2019ve already migrated a few favorites to my kitchen cabinets. This winter I\u2019ll pile potato salad on a pastel gingham plate...then head straight to the couch.Photo by Laura MurrayPoketo Bamboo Dinner Plates, Set of Four$48 at GarmentoryPhoto by Laura MurrayBamboo Side Plates, Set of Four$40 at Xenia TalerExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish Loves ItFashion PlatesShoppingRecipes you want to make.
