The owner Ichiro Sekiguchi is over 100 years old, but his shop is as relevant and interesting today as it was when it opened in 1948. Beans are roasted in-house and in small batches a mere number of feet away from where they are brewed, and the staff prepares the single-origin coffees with precision and care. A variety of specialty drinks showcase Sekiguchi\u2019s open-mindedness toward what coffee can be\u2014the rigidity of other shops has no home here.ORDER THE: single origins if you crave coffee at full volume. Or try one of the speciality drinks for something more playful. The caf\u00e9 oeufs, a cup of hot barely sweetened coffee that has been fortified by the addition of a raw egg yolk, is particularly interesting. The yolk does all the things that cream does for coffee but with more richness and finesse. Drink it fast though, before the eggs start to set.THE VIBE IS: nostalgic. In all its years of operation, very little has changed here. It\u2018s still a cozy little haven where the cognoscenti can escape the hordes of shoppers buzzing around Ginza. No matter what year it actually is, inside this shop it will feel like a bygone era.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Monday through Saturday from 12 p.m. to 10 p.m., and Sundays from 12 p.m. to 7 p.m. The menu is available in English and the staff also speaks some English. The nearest subway stations are Ginza and Shimbashi.Photo by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneThe beans are roasted in-house, just feet away from where they\u2018re brewed.\nPhoto by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneThough the shop opened 70 years ago, it\u2018s still as relevant as ever.\nBy Kee Byung-keunExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
