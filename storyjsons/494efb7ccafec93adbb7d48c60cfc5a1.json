(In Weinstein\u2019s recipe, that\u2019s \u00bd cup of heavy cream whipped to stiff peaks per 1 cup of arborio rice.) Sure, whipped cream won\u2019t save a gluey or gummy risotto (hey, there\u2019s always arancini), but it will make good risotto even better. In the corn risotto recipe, that means whipping \u00bd cup of heavy cream to stiff peaks and then gently folding it into the pot.The direction to mix stiffly whipped cream into a pot of risotto\u2014as Weinstein instructs, along with Serious Eats\u2019s J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt and mega-chef Thomas Keller, too\u2014is one of those recipe steps that\u2019s both pleasing and puzzling. Like, pour hot water over your cobbler for a shatteringly crisp crust. Or drizzle three cups of cream over torn kale and sliced cheddar cheese for your life\u2019s best gratin. Or fry almonds and then use their oil as the base for a toasty, nutty pasta sauce.Another way to make your risotto really dang creamy? Slap it with mascarpone.\nBut here\u2019s why this crazy tip works: Just as whipped egg whites add levity and bounce to sponge cakes (and even pancakes and omelets), whipped cream fluffs and loosens risotto, all while making it silkier and even more luxurious. Yes, the foundational creaminess of well-made risotto should come from the starches that the grains release slowly over the cooking process\u2014but a bit of actual cream doesn\u2019t hurt, either.Make sure to season the risotto with salt after you\u2019ve added the whipped cream. Adding whipped cream, like adding any significant amount of dairy, will mute some of its flavors. And while eating a bowl of whipped cream doesn\u2019t sound like the worst dinner in the world, we\u2019re guessing it\u2019s not exactly what you were going for.Another creamy dinner idea:Explore Bon App\u00e9titRisottoCooking TipsWhipped CreamRead MorecookingMake This Risi e Bisi Just So You Can Say It Over and Over AgainBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.
