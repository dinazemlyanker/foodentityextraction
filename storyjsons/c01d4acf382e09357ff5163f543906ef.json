RossDecember 21, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmail2018... Yep. That was a year. Moving on! 2019! A new year! A new you! Kind of. Because let\u2019s be real, you\u2019re never going to keep your closet clean and I\u2019m never turning in my invoices on time, so let\u2019s focus on low-impact goals that don\u2019t require another unused Pilates package. Here are six tips that will help you drink better in 2019 and in all the many joyous, non-hellish years I am praying for ahead.Get Universal GlasswareI\u2019ve never been a fan of using different glasses for different wines. You may start with a full set of each, but we both know damn well you end up with two mismatching white wine glasses, four big-ass-bowled red wine glasses, and Champagne flute. (On that note, get over flutes! You don\u2019t need them! Their narrow shape is created to enhance bubbles, but they mostly flatten a wine\u2019s aromas.) Instead, why don\u2019t you just get yourself a set of easily replaceable universal glasses? For years my pick has been Crate & Barrel\u2019s Nattie Red Wine Glass. A set costs you $28 and singles are $4, so you\u2019re not breaking the bank every time your friend\u2019s girlfriend gets drunk and somehow destroys three of them. If you want to go a little fancier, go for the universal Zalto. But they\u2019re $60 a pop so perhaps consult this chart before making any impulse buys. Either way, I like my glassware with stems. Otherwise, you\u2019re just warming your wine with your hands.Order More Bottles, Fewer GlassesNatural wine is becoming a staple on many restaurant and bar lists\u2014and I couldn\u2019t be happier!\u2014but many of them are not meant to be poured by the glass. Without preservatives, these wines begin to change as soon as they are introduced to oxygen. Ensure that the wine you\u2019re ordering is at its freshest and most delicious by opting to for the bottle, instead of individual glasses. Remember a bottle has about four glasses (and some change) in it, so if there are two of you it\u2019s already worth it. Don\u2019t finish it? You can always cork it and take it with you. Now that\u2019s my kind of leftovers.Retire \u201cFunky\u201d as a DescriptorAs the new catch-all descriptor for natural wine, \u201cfunky\u201d has been rendered totally meaningless. Some people use it to find bottles with well-balanced volatile acidity; others are picking up on the faulted stuff, riddled with overpowering Brettanomyces. Next time you have a \u201cfunky\u201d wine you do or don\u2019t like, take some time to think about more specific ways to describe it. Take note of things like region, varieties, and even winemaker. And remember: Don\u2019t be afraid to just say it like you taste it. The more specific you can be, the more enjoyable your wine purchases will become.We Still Need to Drink More WaterI gave us this awesome tip last year and you know what, I know we still did not drink enough water in 2018! Drinking water is the second most important part of drinking wine. (Drinking wine is the first, obviously.)Quit It With The Whole \u201cYou Don\u2019t Get Hangovers from Natural Wine\u201d BSBruh. That is a myth. While many people do experience fewer effects of hangovers from natural wine because it has less additives and often lower alcohol by volume (ABV), that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t happen. TRUST ME, IT DOES. It\u2019s simple maths: If you\u2019re downing a bunch of bottles in a two-hour time span at the bar, yeah, you\u2019re probably going to be hungover\u2014especially because we already discussed you\u2019re not drinking enough water. But if you have multiple bottles spanned out over many hours with friends, food, and again, water, you\u2019ll be right as rain the next day. Don\u2019t think you\u2019re invincible. I do this shit for a living and get a nice quarterly reminder migraine that drinking is still drinking, and you have to take care of yourself.Buy Quality Over QuantityA phrase that can be applied to literally anything, but make sure to apply it to your wine purchases in 2019 and beyond. Climate change is coming down hard on wine producers with grapes being destroyed by relentless heat, devastating frosts, and other unseasonal and unpredictable weather patterns. Without grapes, there is no wine. A wine you loved one year for $20 might be $30 the next, and while of course there are jerks who are trying to capitalize on the growing market, many times price hikes are because these are farmers with families and responsibilities just like us. Remember your dollars do count, and if you love a wine, use those dollars to support it. You may not be able to buy as many bottles as you did before, but you\u2019ll be investing in that producer\u2019s future and in more wines you love.And as always, enjoy it.Don\u2019t overthink it. There\u2019s enough in the world to worry about, don\u2019t make wine be one of them.Want even more goals?
