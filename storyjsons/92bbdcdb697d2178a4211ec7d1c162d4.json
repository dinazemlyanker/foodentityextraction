Hatch chile chocolate! Hatch chile hype is real but for a limited time only\u2014and that\u2019s what makes it special.By Priya KrishnaSeptember 13, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Matt Taylor-GrossFacebookTwitterEmailTo many, August and September are a time to wind down after a busy summer, maybe buy a puffy fall coat, or get ready for a new school term. But in the Southwest, those months are a fleeting Brigadoon-like window for sourcing the area\u2019s most wildly hyped variety of produce. It\u2019s Hatch chile season.Think of the Hatch chile like the pumpkin spice of the Rio Grande. It\u2019s a flavor people can\u2019t get enough of; it\u2019s a limited season; it can be found at grocery stores and restaurants in everything from ice cream to sushi to beer. And over the past few years, it has gone from prized local pepper to full-on cultural icon.The Hatch is like no pepper you\u2019ve had before: it\u2019s sweet and smoky, it has a slight funk to it and a grassiness that makes it always taste like it\u2019s freshly picked. Like a jalape\u00f1o with more of a character arc.\u201cOnce you have a Hatch chile, you always have to have a Hatch chile,\u201d explains Chris Franzoy, the president of Young Guns Produce, a farm in the Hatch Valley, New Mexico. \u201cI can\u2019t explain it. It just does something to you.\u201dThe small, slightly wrinkled green pepper was developed in New Mexico in the early 1900s by horticulturist Fabi\u00e1n Garci\u00e1, according to Stephanie Walker, Ph.D., a plant specialist at New Mexico State University. Garci\u00e1 found that the local population didn\u2019t take to the earlier varieties of peppers because the crop grew in unpredictable timetables, plus the taste was too spicy. Through crossbreeding he developed a more uniform, mild chile, which kicked off the development of what is known in the area as New Mexico chiles.Hatch chiles by the barrel-full.\nPhoto by Matt Taylor-GrossThe name, \u201cHatch chile,\u201d Walker says, is slightly misleading, as many presume that it\u2019s a species of pepper grown exclusively in Hatch, New Mexico. It\u2019s more of an umbrella term, encompassing a group of green chiles grown across the state. According to Sonja Schroeder, the executive director of the New Mexico Chile Association, a traveler in the 1970s was passing through Hatch, New Mexico, tried a local variety of chile, and started calling it the Hatch chile. The name took off.\u201cBut if you drive into Hatch there is really nothing to it,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s just five buildings surrounded by green chiles. I guess it inspires people.\u201dThe Hatch chile has long been essential to New Mexican cuisine, where the official state question (yes, this is a thing) is \u201cRed or green?\u201d referring to the red and green chile sauces that adorn many local dishes. But as folks from New Mexico have moved throughout the Southwest, the chile has become a phenomenon across the whole region.What gets people psyched about the Hatch chile is its limited availability, which makes it feel even more special. The season typically runs from August to September, but depending on weather conditions, that can be shorter or longer. Hatch chiles are uniquely tough to grow too, says Chris Franzoy, whose family has been growing the pepper for five generations. \u201cThey require a lot of daily attention,\u201d he says, including closely monitoring irrigation schedules and dealing with weed maintenance and pests. Jimmy Lytle, another Hatch chile farmer, based in Hatch, says they can only grow in this area because of its specific conditions: the hot days and cool nights, the elevation, and the soil.A Hatch chile harvest in New Mexico.\nPhoto by Matt Taylor-GrossThat narrow time frame drives locals to amass Hatch chiles during the season to freeze and use throughout the year, whereas restaurants (and even chains like McDonald\u2019s) across the region will put Hatch chiles in their burritos and burgers as a limited-time offering.One of the biggest drivers of the Hatch chile craze is H-E-B, the Texas grocery chain with a cult following (and an ace marketing squad). Twenty-four years ago, its gourmet store, Central Market, launched Hatch Fest, a season-long celebration of all things Hatch chile. There\u2019s Hatch chile ice cream, Hatch chile cookies, Hatch chile crab cakes, even a Hatch chile sushi with salmon. Before the season starts H-E-B will set up a countdown clock on social media and send out emails with ecstatic subject lines like, \u201cHatch-steria is spreading!\u201d People will post photos of their Hatch chile haul on Twitter, with comments like, \u201cLetting me go to @HEB unsupervised during Hatch chile season is probably a mistake\u201d or \u201cIT\u2019S HATCH CHILE SEASON, BABY!!!!!!! HATCH CHILE CHEESE, HATCH CHILE COOKIES, HATCH CHILE CHICKEN, HATCH CHILE POPCORN, we\u2019ll even dip your BABIES in HAAAAATCH CHILE\u201d (this is a real post).\u201cThe summer months are slow and then Hatch hits and people are coming in and asking us, \u2018How are the peppers going to be? What is the heat level? When will they arrive?\u2019\u201d says Chris Bostad, Central Market\u2019s head of merchandising. He adds that people will show up with large coolers to fill with Hatch chile products; it\u2019s second only to the holidays in terms of busiest times of the year. Throughout the season team members will roast Hatch chiles outside the stores to perfume the aisles with that sweet, roast-y smell and get customers excited.Another aspect of the Hatch hype machine: the Hatch Chile Festival in Hatch, New Mexico, every August. What started as a small gathering of 500 in 1972 has grown into 20,000, complete with chile eating contests and a make-your-own ristra workshop (referring to the decorative arrangements of dried chiles popular in the region). Sissy Franzoy, one of the festival organizers, says that after the festival was featured on the Food Network in 2003, attendance skyrocketed, drawing visitors from Japan, Australia, and Germany.That Hatch Chile Festival queen!\nPhoto by Matt Taylor-GrossI ask Schroeder if the New Mexico Chile Association is actively marketing the Hatch chile (similar to, say, the American Kale Association or Avocados From Mexico board). She laughed. They don\u2019t need to. The Hatch chile is embedded into the culture. It\u2019s a full-blown mythology\u2014a spicy, smoky, southwest fantasy filled with emerald green peppers growing in lush fields.If anything, a big problem Schroeder faces is Hatch chile fraud, people growing other varieties of green chiles elsewhere in the world and giving them the \u201cHatch\u201d label. Unfortunately, there\u2019s not much anyone can do about that, she says\u2014it\u2019s too hard to monitor.But the New Mexico farmers have mixed feelings about the way in which their chile has exploded in popularity. On the one hand, they\u2019ve seen a steady rise in business. On the other, what\u2019s to prevent the Hatch chile from going the way of pumpkin spice, becoming a clich\u00e9 so tired that there\u2019s a Bath & Body Works scent named after it?\u201cThose are novelties,\u201d says New Mexico farmer Lytle, referring to the Hatch chile beer and Hatch chile cookies. \u201cThe real chile people like [Hatch chiles] in enchiladas and chile con carne and stuff. When we eat chile, we eat the chile. We don\u2019t just put a little here and there as seasoning.\u201dH-E-B\u2019s vice president of produce Kyle Stevens believes \u201cpeople have an emotional connection\u201d to the pepper in a way that they don\u2019t for something like pumpkin spice. \u201cIt is a more romantic story than a latt\u00e9. When you think of Hatch, you think of farmers and chiles and work, and you can connect with that.\u201dEvery season the thought crosses his mind: \u201cIs Hatch played out? Is it done?\u201d he says. \u201cThe answer is no. There will always be a mystique.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titChileTrendsRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
