They\u2019re fast-moving. They\u2019re delicious. They\u2019re shot-tails. (Did we really just say that?)By Rebekah PepplerAugust 26, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Emma FishmanFacebookTwitterEmailIt started at night\u2014as most stories involving shots do. I was having friends over for a drink before going out, and everyone was running late. Without time for a full glass of wine, I shook up a quick cocktail, and divvied it up among small glasses. We passed them around, raised our cups to things like health and love, and then in one swift motion, knocked them back, and walked out the door.That night, tight timing was the mother of invention: an ap\u00e9ritif bright with citrus, light on booze, invigoratingly cold, and surprisingly festive\u2014all in a single mouthful. It was perfect. So perfect, that I now serve different versions of these miniature cocktails every time I get together with friends. And so should you. Heating up the charcoals? Shots! Giving a birthday toast at the start of dinner? Shots! Planning a move on the cute barista you\u2019ve been flirting with all summer? Shots! Once you look at it this way, there\u2019s ample opportunity for shots all night long.Taking only slightly more prep than a steady pour of tequila over a tray of stocky glasses, ap\u00e9ritif shots like the ones below rely on simple, easy-to-execute recipes, and lower alcohol by volume ingredients, like vermouth, wine, and bitters. There\u2019s one, published in my book Ap\u00e9ritif: Cocktail Hour the French Way, that drinks like a slightly bitter (in a good way) margarita, with yellow Suze, blanc vermouth, and lime. There\u2019s a brand-new one, that I\u2019ll call the Half & Half, that combines sweet and dry vermouth with a hit of orange peel, and finishes with a big, buttery, briny Castelvetrano olive. The bright pink Not Shirley Temple also makes its debut here, with Campari, ros\u00e9, lemon juice, and a sweet maraschino cherry chaser.Because ap\u00e9ritif shots are small scale yet fully built drinks, you could be tempted to make each as a normal size cocktail. Please don\u2019t. Instead, raise a petite glass to the night ahead, and then get on with it.Photo by Emma FishmanShot de SuzeMakes 8 shots4 ounces fresh lime juice3 ounces Suze3 ounces blanc vermouth2 lime peelsIn a shaker filled with ice, combine the lime juice, Suze, and vermouth.
