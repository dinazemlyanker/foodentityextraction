Can his new full-service restaurant deliver the same magic?By Dayna EvansMarch 26, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Jason VarneyFacebookTwitterEmailIt\u2019s the opening day of the new Pizzeria Beddia, and it\u2019s been raining so hard there\u2019s a small drip coming in through the front window onto the restaurant\u2019s brand-new wood countertop. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, right?\u201d Joe Beddia says, laughing nervously. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not fine, but\u2014it\u2019s fine.\u201d What else is he going to do?I\u2019m seated at the horseshoe-shaped marble bar next to Beddia\u2019s longtime regulars and fans. It\u2019s 8:30 p.m., and every one of the 90 seats in the house is taken. \u201cWe sold out reservations in ten minutes,\u201d Beddia tells me. \u201cThrough April.\u201d (Luckily, 60 percent of all spots are left for walk-ins.)From the minute Beddia unexpectedly closed his first pizzeria on Shackamaxon and East Girard almost a full year ago, anticipation began mounting for the second. That\u2019s due mostly to the fact that Beddia\u2019s pizza was outrageously good\u2014this publication named it the best pizza in America in 2015\u2014but also in part to the personality of its proprietor. Beddia dedicated himself to the singular vision of making only 40 pizzas a day in a tiny standing-room-only, 300-square-foot space with one employee. There was no phone, no seats, no reservations, no credit cards, no slices. Consistency, simplicity, and a certain personality-driven special sauce were the pizzeria\u2019s defining charms. Locals, he told me, would pick up pies at least once a week, sometimes more. Tonight they all showed up to usher in a new era with Joe, known in some Philly circles as the Pizza Jesus.With this new venture, Beddia is now one of a few dozen people (including general manager Heather Cahill of Marlow & Sons and Diner in Brooklyn) keeping the business running, but he stands out anyway. Dressed in a royal blue chore jacket and a light purple ball cap, he adds color to the clean white space. (\u201cIt straddles the line between Scandinavian and Japanese,\u201d he says of the design.) He\u2019s also the only person in the restaurant sporting an expression of combined terror and joy. He shuffles between expediting pizzas at the kitchen pass and chatting with patrons, new and old, and any time I\u2019m able to catch him, he shakes his head at me. \u201cThis is so crazy,\u201d he says, a little stunned.It\u2019s a fun challenge to determine which part of \u201cthis\u201d is the craziest: Is it the enormous sanguine-faced cloud light fixture hanging above the bar that is destined to become the pizzeria\u2019s unofficial mascot? Is it the expanded menu, which now includes things like meaty Judion white beans with lemon zest, an excellent bibb lettuce salad dressed with a fish sauce vinaigrette, slices of crispy tomato pie (a focaccia-adjacent tomato sauce pizza served cold), a natural-leaning wine list, and espresso soft-serve? Or maybe it\u2019s the \u201choagie room,\u201d a tiny room in the back where small private dinners will soon be available by reservation only.The restaurant\u2019s interior is kept clean and simple.\nPhoto by Jason Varney\u201cThere are so many things to be on top of\u2014there\u2019s the service, the wine. I felt like on Monday that I was going to have a breakdown,\u201d Beddia tells me. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about too many things, and focusing on all the negative stuff.\u201dLess than a year ago Beddia was toiling at his craft in relatively monastic solitude. Now, he is running a full-service restaurant with the noise of partners (Suraya co-owners Greg Root, Nick Kennedy, and Al Lucas), patrons, and pizza critics in his ear. Was it crazy to double down on his pizza-making operation to build something new, something much bigger, something that opens him up to the possibility of failure? Or would it have been crazier to have just given it all up and moved on?For five years straight beginning in 2013, Beddia would arrive at his pizzeria at 9:30 a.m. He\u2019d turn on Howard Stern, make 40 pizza doughs, leave for lunch, and then come back a few hours later to sell the fresh pies with his buddy John Walker until they sold out. They were open Wednesday to Saturday, 5:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. Some days they had bread to sell, and occasionally had time to make hoagies for friends. The same two dudes worked together every day, and if either of them got sick, they would close. On days when Beddia couldn\u2019t make it in, he would post signs on the front door or on Instagram in his signature funny block letters:\u201cPIZZERIA BEDDIA WILL BE CLOSED TONIGHT BECAUSE I\u2019M WATCHING THE SUNSET FROM A BOAT IN NEW YORK CITY I SINCERELY APOLOGIZE FOR THE INCONVENIENCE PLEASE VISIT US AGAIN THIS WEDNESDAY AND ALWAYS CHECK @PIZZACAMP FOR UP TO DATE INFO IT\u2019S ACTUALLY A YACHT BUT I DIDN\u2019T WANT TO RUB IT IN.\u201dEverything was up to Beddia and his whims on any given day, something that felt both refreshing in a city where certain parts had stagnated under a crush of cavernous corporate restaurants, and old school in a way that paid tribute to Philly\u2019s disappearing family-owned-and-operated dining legacy. People were drawn to the commitment of its quirky founder to the craft of making pizza, and doing it the way he wanted to do it.But it thrived most of all because the pizza, which Beddia had spent years perfecting, was really, really, really good.It had a New York\u2013style crunch with salty, intensely savory cheeses and bright tomato flavor; unlike other styles, Beddia does not cook his tomato sauce. There was no wild yeast thrown in or elaborately curated toppings. It was pizza that induced nostalgia for the era of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but if that pizza were elevated with high-quality fresh ingredients like Old Gold aged cheese and New Jersey tomatoes.A 15-inch pie with tomato, fresh mozzarella, and Old Gold cheese.\nPhoto by Jason Varney\u201cFrom the locally sourced ingredients to his meticulously fermented dough, he practically sends each one into the oven with a goodbye kiss,\u201d Philly Inquirer restaurant critic Craig LaBan wrote when the first spot opened, assuring that the hour-long waits were really worth it.It quickly became a local favorite, but manageably so. \u201cWe weren\u2019t always at capacity. There were nights when we sold 18 pizzas,\u201d Beddia tells me. Despite the high demand for his pies, Beddia still had time to occasionally crack a beer on the job\u2014his pizzeria was small, and so was his city\u2019s food scene.Over time the press built up. The reputation grew. People from all over the country started coming in search of his pies, lining up at 9 a.m. to be the first to get a taste. \u201c\u2018This is insane. There's no reason for this,\u2019\u201d he remembers thinking. \u201cPeople are always like, \u2018That\u2019s a good problem!\u2019 Why are problems good? It never feels good to me. To John\u2019s and my credit, we didn't change anything. We just put our heads down and kept doing the work.\u201dThen, in February of 2018, at the height of his success and seemingly out of nowhere, Beddia announced that he\u2019d be closing the tiny operation to open a bigger pizzeria sometime later that year. He posted about the new pizzeria on Instagram with characteristic self-effacement: \u201cWe all know it\u2019s not going to be as good. I mean it\u2019s not really that good now it\u2019s just all hype. Anyway, I\u2019m going to take a little break and regroup. It\u2019s definitely going to be a different experience. Can\u2019t wait to share it with you. Xoxo\u201dBeddia\u2019s mind\u2014by his own admission\u2014is always somewhere else. When he talks, he shifts around a lot and punctuates his sentences with intermittent \u201cI dunno\u201ds, sometimes quick, like an alternative to \u201cum,\u201d and other times drawn out like he may actually be deciding in that moment whether he believes what he\u2019s saying. As in, \u201cI'm obsessed with quality. Quality is not subjective, I dunno\u201d and \u201cI have these ideas and luckily I just do them, I dooon\u2019t knooow.\u201d He\u2019s self-deprecating, but as you might expect for a guy who did the same thing basically every day for five years, he is very confident in and excited by the things that he does know: pizza, wine, beer, Philly.His interest in food began with his Italian-American family: His dad, aunts, and grandmothers are all first-generation immigrants from Sicily. \u201cThey\u2019d put a bunch of meat in a pot, cook it slowly, and then you\u2019d eat spaghetti with it,\u201d he tells me of his early food memories. \u201cEvery time you went to their house, you ate well.\u201dThe bibb lettuce salad with watermelon radish, apples, Marcona almonds, and fish sauce vinaigrette.\nPhoto by Jason VarneyHe was 16 when he took his first job at a hotel restaurant in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he was born and raised: He\u2019d help set up a buffet on Saturdays and Sundays that served 500 people, an experience he likened to running a pirate ship. In college he studied in a hospitality program for a year before dropping out and then sold discount polos at a Ralph Lauren outlet store in Reading. After work he\u2019d go with his friends to a \u201clegendary beer bar,\u201d the Northeast Taproom. It was there that Beddia met one of his earliest influences, a beer obsessive named Pete Cammarano, who was also the owner, the bartender, and the sole employee at the time. It was a one-man operation that felt intimate, deliberate, and personal.He got into brewing beer and spent four months in Japan working at Kiuchi Brewery. While there, he ate a life-changing marinara pizza at Savoy and observed Japanese chefs who were the lone employee of their own caf\u00e9s. It was in Tokyo that he realized exactly what he wanted to do with his life: open a pizza restaurant influenced by deeply skilled sushi chefs, owner-bartenders who mopped the floors themselves, and old-school pizza guys like Dom DeMarco of Di Fara Pizza in Brooklyn.\u201cJoey has always been a do-it-yourself kind of person,\u201d Beddia\u2019s younger sister Maria, an illustrator in Philly, explains. \u201cHe talked about opening a pizza place for years. We kind of all made a joke of it. \u2018Sure, sure, when\u2019s that going to happen?\u2019\u201dSo when it did happen, and it blew up, everyone was even more shocked that, after five years of runaway success, Beddia shut it down. \u201cWhen you\u2019re selling out every day, and you\u2019re able to walk to work, and you have one really amazing employee, it just kind of seemed like the perfect job,\u201d Maria recalls. \u201cBut his mental approach was, This is a project. At some point, I\u2019m going to move on.\u201dThe bar with its friendly cloud light fixture (designed by art collective Friends With You) and will-be mascot.\nPhoto by Jason Varney\u201cI just didn\u2019t want to do it anymore,\u201d Beddia told me in January, when he first showed me around the new space, which at the time was still a construction zone in an old machine shop behind the El train. \u201cI wanted to continue to make pizza,\u201d he clarified, \u201cbut I wanted to not hate it.\u201dHe initially toyed with the idea of making wine, but ultimately he realized that the litany of challenges, questions, and decisions that come with opening a full-service restaurant appealed to him in the same way that cracking the code for the perfect pizza did.\u201cI get to design the space, serve you the wine, the salads, the pizza,\u201d he says of his new role, which notably does not include making all the pizzas himself. Instead, he\u2019s teaching a staff of pizzaiolos to make it his way. \u201cHow do you teach them if it can be so variable? You just show them and talk about it,\u201d he says. He\u2019ll continue to oversee the process until he\u2019s satisfied they can make it right without him.\u201cI always get somewhere and then I want to move past it. It\u2019s like you learn the thing, you do it, and then it\u2019s over,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s weird to be defined by pizza in some way. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t care about it. I did it.
