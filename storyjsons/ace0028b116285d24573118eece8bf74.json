When something's so easy to make that you don't even need one. Welcome to It's That Simple, a column where our staffers talk you through the process of making the dishes and drinks that they can make with their eyes closed.When it comes to alcohol, people have strong preferences and fierce brand loyalty. Since my grandfather was a Bacardi bigwig\u2014 you know, flying down to Puerto Rico in the 70s and 80s, wearing a linen suit and carrying a briefcase full of cigars\u2014you might think that I\u2019m a Bacardi diehard. Wrong. When it comes to rum, I'm generous with my love: I appreciate a nice bottle of Mount Gay, warm, brown, and mellow; other times, I\u2019m in the mood for some high-proof white Wray and Nephew (strong! flammable! delicious!). A dark rum like Goslings? Great!That\u2019s the beauty of this rum punch: You can use whatever bottles you\u2019ve got knocking around. You're free to substitute rums interchangeably\u2014mix together what you have, or maybe even use other liquors in its place (a bottle of warm tequila on the table from this past Saturday? Fine!). You could pretty much use any base spirit here and it will taste perfect each time.Maybe you\u2019re thinking, \u201cEarth to Bryan: It\u2019s the last weekend in September. What am I supposed to do with this refreshing, seemingly summertime cocktail?\u201d Well, so what if you\u2019re gearing up for mulled wine and spiked cider? I promise this can be enjoyed any time of year! I make this for punch for every occasion: a party with friends, Thanksgiving dinner, a beach day, an afternoon park hang, or when it\u2019s just me home alone on a Friday night because a party for one is better than no party at all. Who wouldn't want a refreshingly sweet-tart-citrusy tropical delight in the middle of fall\u2014or winter, for that matter? Keep this one in your arsenal.Let me walk you through how it's made. I typically eyeball everything\u2014call me a bartender\u2014but I've also listed quantities for you precise types:First, gather your ingredients.Juices: Since you can use nearly any kind of rum you can find, splurge a little on the juice\u2014it\u2019s make a difference. You\u2019ll need four kinds. First, 1 oz. fresh-squeezed orange juice (the bottled stuff will not compare). Second, 1/2 oz. fancy cranberry juice, the kind that comes in a glass bottle at Whole Foods-y places. Yes it\u2019s pricey but it\u2019s worth it\u2014and so are you. Third,  2 oz. pineapple juice. I always use the one in a can\u2014Dole is great for this. And, finally, the juice of half a lime.Grenadine: This is key! You can buy a bottle, but my good friend Al Culliton has made grenadine a whole lot better with this DIY recipe. Either way, you need 1/4 oz. grenadine.Flavorings: Orgeat (a floral syrup made from almonds), vanilla or almond extract, or Angostura bitters. A dash of any of these ingredients will elevate your punch to a whole new level.Rum: You want 3 oz. total, and I usually do 50/50 mix of light to dark (but you can do whatever combination you please\u2014see rant above)Now onto the process.Shake: Load up your cocktail shaker with ice, fill it up with the four juices, grenadine, flavorings, and rum, and shake until you feel dizzy\u201430 seconds. You want the outside of the shaker to frost. It should be so cold it almost hurts. By doing this, you\u2019re diluting the booze and combining all of the tropical flavors.Present: This is your time to be creative. I am a nerd who collects vintage tiki glassware, so I love to get fancy here. I like to make it look cute with a little lime wheel and a maraschino cherry or a pineapple wedge. Do not feel pressured to do as I do. You can put this in your fave Garfield mug and call it a day. Do make sure you use fresh ice. The rocks, as we \"bartenders\" say, are very important!!!You also can\u2014and absolutely should\u2014batch for a group. Make this large format by scaling up (some good old-fashioned multiplication), then throw a big ice ring in your favorite bowl and pour the punch over top. Make sure to dilute it with some water if you plan on letting folks scoop in their own cups and go on their merry way. You might be throwing a seasonal curveball by hosting a tiki party when it's cider season. So be it. With this punch, you\u2019ll always keep your friends on their toes.Ready to rum?Rum + Sugar + Lime = 3 Perfect Summer CocktailsWhen the summer heat won't stop, it's time for rum.View StoryExplore Bon App\u00e9titIt's That SimplePunchCocktailRecipes you want to make.
