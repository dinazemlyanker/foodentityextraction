Now I make this for my husband and myself at home all the time. I love it with shortbread cookies and coffee cake in the morning or with ice cream at night. My parents are back home in Japan and I sent my mom this recipe for a gathering they had last year. She made a big batch and kept it warm in the CrockPot for guests to serve themselves. There\u2019s no situation where this wouldn\u2019t be good.\u201d Momose likes to buy her h\u014djicha from kettl.co and rareteacellar.com.IngredientsMakes 27green cardamom pods5star anise13\" cinnamon stick1tsp. pink peppercorns\u00becup (8 grams) h\u014djichaHoney, sugar, or molasses (for serving)special equipmentA mortar and pestlePreparationStep 1Preheat an oven to 350\u00b0.
