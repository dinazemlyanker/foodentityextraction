I\u2019m not talking about a balsamic vinaigrette\u2014my preferred dressing is so luxuriously silky and richly flavored that every time I make it, I sop up every drop with bread heels and, well, fingers. Folks, I\u2019m talking about spicy cashew dressing.Senior food editor Molly Baz developed this dressing for Bon Appetit\u2019s next-level salad primer, where she found inspiration in the vegan nut-based Caesar dressings at NYC\u2019s Lalito and Scarr\u2019s Pizza, which have developed a cult-following (as much as you can say that about a salad dressing. But truly, the fans are fervent).Really, this dressing is all about the balance of high-impact flavors: Funky fish sauce, bright rice wine vinegar, spicy red pepper flakes, and plenty of salted, roasted cashews (which are fatty enough to replace about half the oil you\u2019d typically need) are blended together to make a creamy, silky-smooth sauce with layers of toastiness and heat.It's that dressing that helps all of the ingredients in this salad make sense together.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiTo make it vegan, sub the honey and fish sauce for maple syrup and soy sauce.  Whatever you do, don\u2019t try to swap in raw cashews. Roasting unlocks nuts\u2019 complex, aromatic flavor, and it\u2019s easy to do at home. You can buy salted, roasted nuts from the store, but I'm way more likely to have raw cashews at home. I toss them two teaspoons of olive oil and \u00bd teaspoon of salt, spread them on a sheet tray, and roast at 350\u00b0 until my kitchen smells delicious and those cashews look golden, normally 8 to 10 minutes. I know it can be tempting to cut to the chase and skip this step, but taking those few minutes to toast unlocks a whole new world of flavor. And when the ingredient list is this minimal, it pays to make the most of it.I usually follow the recipe, adding \u2153 cup of warm water before blending to create a pourable, leaf-coating dressing that will make any random assemblage of ingredients that I'm calling a \"salad\" a cohesive meal. Its powerful flavor stands up to all kinds of pairings\u2014after all, this dressing was developed to go with a dinner-worthy salad loaded with sweet potatoes, 8-minute eggs, and sturdy, bitter chicories. And when I want a thicker dip for crudit\u00e9s like Persian cucumbers and cute lil\u2019 endive leaves, I'll hold back a few tablespoons for a more scoopable sauce.I\u2019m confident there\u2019s no jumble of fridge flotsam this nutty dressing can\u2019t improve. Give it your loose carrots, roast chicken, and other leftovers yearning to breathe free\u2014under a blanket of cashew dip, everything is delicious.Get the recipe:Spicy Cashew DressingInspired by the nut-based Caesar dressings at NYC\u2019s Lalito and Scarr\u2019s Pizza, our version starts with roasted cashews.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titNever FailRecipes you want to make.
