It\u2019s delicious and not at all as intimidating as it sounds. Cilantro is an obvious and perfectly suitable garnish for serving, or you could use a riot of colorful herbs like red shiso, delfino cilantro, and even peppermint.IngredientsMakes about 2 cups1\u00bccups grapeseed oil6garlic cloves, peeled1cup raw peanuts4dried pasilla chiles, seeds removed4dried ancho chiles, seeds removed10dried chiles de \u00e1rbolKosher saltPurple corn tostadas, avocado wedges, tender herbs, and lime wedges (for serving)PreparationStep 1Cook oil and garlic in a large saucepan over medium heat until garlic is golden brown all over, 6\u20138 minutes. Spoon out garlic with a slotted spoon; save for another use or discard. Add peanuts to oil and simmer until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a small rimmed baking sheet with spoon. Cook pasilla chiles in oil just until slightly puffed and darkened, 30\u201360 seconds. Transfer to baking sheet with peanuts. Repeat with ancho chiles, then chiles de \u00e1rbol. Let oil cool slightly.Step 2Transfer peanuts and chiles to a food processor and pulse until coarsely chopped.

Go easy on the hot peppers and don't burn the peanuts. If you make it right, you can use it on anything. I'm roasting a spatchcocked chicken right now that I smothered inside and out with the sauce. Will be done in about ten more minutes. Fingers crossed!Scott CitronNew York City12/9/2020@HalGuy: Are you stirring the salsa before serving? If not, the oil will separate from the peanuts & chilies due to the difference in density. Don't leave a metal spoon in salsas, I would further advise against using less oil (I would actually do 2 cups oil + add 1 - 2 tbsps. of sesame seeds); however if you feel you have achieved the desired consistency with less--that's entirely up to you & your palate. You can get away with using roasted unsalted peanuts with this, but when you're putting the chilies in the oil DO NOT WALK AWAY. Once they go beyond the toasty stage which happens really fast if your oil is hot, they will burn and taste very bitter. Source: I'm MexicanlavodnasMexico/IL4/8/2019This did not turn out for me. I think I overcooked the peppers and I also used raw peanuts with the skins on. Both of which I can correct on the next attempt. I have a question about the volume of oil to be added into the food processor. Should the entire volume (1.25 cups) be used or just enough to achieve the desired consistency? I added it all and now there is a liquid layer and a grit layer (consisting of the chopped peanuts and peppers). I'm thinking I should just added enough oil to make a slightly runny paste.
