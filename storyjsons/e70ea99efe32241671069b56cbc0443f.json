This is one of her go-to salads.By Christina TosiNovember 2, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailIn honor of Ina Garten's guest editing week, we asked chefs and celebrity fans to share their favorite Barefoot Contessa recipes as part of our series \u201cHow Easy Is That?\u201d Below, Christina Tosi, founder and CEO of Milk Bar and author of new cookbook All About Cake, explains how her Ina-themed dinner party club started, and why pasta, pesto, and peas salad will always be on the menu.\u00a0\n\u00a0About five years ago, some pals and I were at a dinner party and we couldn\u2019t get over the roast chicken. The hostess was like, \u201cOh my god, this is my girl Ina\u2019s roast chicken! We\u2019ve never met before, but I just love her. It feels like our chicken now.\u201d I realized that whenever I host a dinner party, my tableau is basically all Ina recipes. So we decided to start a tradition where once a year, my friends and I come together for an Ina party.The Ina Club rules are simple: The entire table must be filled with recipes by Ina and Ina only. We all go to the market, channeling our inner Inas and shop based on what looks good, smells good, and inspires us. None of us necessarily knows what recipe we\u2019ll make, but we do know seasonally which ones are our tried-and-true favorites. Then we bring the goods home, scour the internet and open all the Ina cookbooks, and make a meal. Everyone usually makes a few dishes, and we eat potluck-style.The most requested recipes for the Ina Club are almost laughably simple, like the summer pasta salad with tomato, Parmesan, and basil, and Parmesan-roasted broccoli. In the wintertime, I did a customized grilled cheese bar to go with her perfect tomato soup. I cleaned out my fridge of all the cheeses, jellies, and jams, let people mix and match, and then cut into little squares to be \u201ccroutons.\u201d What a genius idea\u2014grilled cheese croutons!But one of my personal favorites to make is the pasta, pesto, and peas salad from Barefoot Contessa Parties! In this recipe, she finds a beautiful balance of things that are familiar and unexpected, like taking peas, blanching and blending them, and then putting them into a cold pasta salad with pesto. On some level, it was earth shattering when she did that\u2014it just seemed so perfectly outside of the box, yet also perfectly acceptable and classy. It was like edgy without being edgy; it was like all the effort, but in an effortless way. She really taught me that great food can be accessible and comfortable, but that you can take it just one step further by throwing yourself out of your comfort zone.With both Ina as a person and with her recipes, there's an ease, but there's also empowerment. She's not selling the persona of perfection\u2014she's selling humanity. She\u2019s just being her, and that\u2019s what makes her so perfectly, untouchably lovable on every level.In my five years of hosting the Ina Club, I\u2019ve never once invited her. I don\u2019t want her to get bombarded with crazy, overly enthusiastic (yet very lovely) women, and I know she probably gets a lot of invitations. But maybe next year will be the year I surprise everyone when she joins us. So, consider the invitation open for 2019, Ina!\u2014As told to Alyse Whitney\u00a0Ina Garten\u2019s Pasta, Pesto, and PeasFrom Barefoot Contessa Parties!Serves 12This famous Barefoot Contessa recipe originally came from my wonderful friend Brent Newson. In order to keep the pesto from turning brown, he adds spinach and lemon juice.
