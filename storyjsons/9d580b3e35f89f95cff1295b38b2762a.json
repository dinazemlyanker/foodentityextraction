It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.There are lots of things I love about New York City, but heat and humidity are not among them. Unfortunately, we are entering into season of the damp. Take this week, for example. Humid and sort-of raining every day, with temperatures in the mid-70s. Perfect for being misted with water while one\u2019s own body self-mists. Perfect for subway platforms that resemble\u2014atmospherically\u2014New Orleans in August. Perfect for what my sister calls \u201cswamp ass.\u201d (If you know, then you know.)For a curly-haired person like myself, this is the season of surrender. Even though it would be nice to not have a damp spot on the back of my T-shirt and incredibly frizzy hair, something about this weather makes me crave spicy food, ideally in the form of these kimchi noodles.Photo by Alex LauWant this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!First you put butter, cabbage kimchi, and gochujang in a pan, and I don\u2019t know what it is about those crazy kids, but man-oh-man something about dairy richness and spicy pickled funkiness just really works. (When I was a line cook about a thousand years ago, we made a sauce with creme fra\u00eech\u00e8 and chopped kimchi, and the flavor of this sauce takes me right back there.) Then you add more kimchi juice and chicken stock, but truth be told I will almost always use water instead of stock, unless I have homemade on hand at home. Meanwhile, you\u2019ve got udon boiling away (let\u2019s be real, any wheat-based noodle is invited to this party, be it ramen or thick spaghetti). The noodles get into the sauce, more (!!) butter jumps in, and you top the whole thing with a raw egg yolk, some scallions, and a smattering of sesame seeds. The egg yolk should get tossed and broken into the sauce so it coats the noodles, tempering a little of the heat with its own richness.Hot and spicy food on a hot and \u201cyoo-mid\u201d day feels right to me. It will make you sweat, but you were already sweating! It will curl the hair on your head, which is already frizzed like Gilda Radner\u2019s. You might need a cold dunk after, which is what you needed before, but at least your belly will be full. It\u2019s going to be a steamy summer, guys. Let\u2019s not fight the current any longer.Get the recipe:Kimchi Udon with ScallionsThe power trio of butter, kimchi, and gochujang produces an umami ballad so beautiful in this udon recipe, you\u2019ll want to play it over and over again.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCarla Newsletter UdonSpicyKimchiRead MorecookingA Strawberry Dessert for People Who Can\u2019t BakeBy Carla Lalli MusiccookingI\u2019m Only Drinking Pi\u00f1a Coladas From Now OnBy Carla Lalli MusiccookingYou Can Keep Your Ramps, I\u2019m Stampeding the Farmers\u2019 Market for PotatoesBy Carla Lalli MusiccookingMy Broccoli Delight Recipe Won\u2019t Be Censored Any LongerBy Carla Lalli MusicRecipes you want to make.
