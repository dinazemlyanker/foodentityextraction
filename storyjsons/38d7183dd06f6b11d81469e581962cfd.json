It looks pretty basic\u2014they\u2019re just riding sleds!\u2014but the slight maneuvers you don\u2019t even notice are where the real brilliance lies. This recipe uses fewer than ten ingredients, most of them pantry staples, and in a few key moves produces weeknight dinner gold. It also includes a brand new method for how to cook chicken thighs perfectly every time! I\u2019m talking big, but trust me. Here\u2019s how it comes together.The first move you\u2019ll nail is the cold pan method. I\u2019m already on record talking about how to cook chicken thighs perfectly, but this method completely changes the game. It\u2019s the NEW perfect way to cook chicken thighs. You start with a cold, oven-safe pan, add a little olive oil and your marinated chicken thighs skin-side down, then turn on the heat. The slow increase in temperature keeps the skin from crisping too quickly and shrinking. It makes the skin brown more evenly, too. Get this technique right, and you\u2019re already guaranteed a spot on the podium.Once the thighs are crisp and golden like the medal you\u2019re going to win, put them into a 450\u00b0 oven to cook through. While that\u2019s happening, you\u2019ll tackle move #2: hot honey. You\u2019ve probably seen hot honey in fancy grocery stores, but it\u2019s super easy to make at home. You thinly slice a red chile, warm it in a small saucepan of honey until it barely simmers, then let the mixture cool. Look at that: 10 out of 10! Impossible to mess up!When the chicken thighs come out of the oven 16-20 minutes later, put them on a plate and get ready for move #3: fried bread. This move is like nailing the tightest turn in the last five seconds of the course. Why? Because you\u2019re pan-frying bread in chicken fat. Let me repeat: You\u2019re putting slices of bread in sizzling chicken schmaltz and frying it on both sides. Start singing your national anthem of choice right now because you\u2019ve clinched this one. (One word of caution: Use an oven mitt while frying because you\u2019re going to grab the pan handle without thinking about it, and that pan just came out of a very hot oven, and even Olympians feel pain.)The secret to perfectly crispy chicken thighs is starting with a cold pan.\nWhen the bread is crisp and golden, take it out of the pan, sprinkle it with a little coarse salt, and let it drain for a minute on some paper towels. With a flourish, pour the last of the pan juices over a bowl of endive leaves like it\u2019s no big thing, add lemon juice and salt, and toss like the champion you are.Now you have to get that presentation score: Put the schmaltzy bread on the bottom of the serving plate, poking some holes in it with a knife so the chicken juices can run through. Then top with your chicken, scatter the endive all over, and spoon the hot honey on everything. There\u2019s no polite way to eat this, so go for it with your hands. Winners don\u2019t apologize, and you worked hard for this.Get the crispiest, winning-est chicken thigh recipe of all time:Hot Honey Chicken Thighs with Fried BreadYou\u2019re essentially making a large chicken fat\u2013doused crouton here, people.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titChickenhoneyBreadWeeknightRead Morerecipes13 Crispy, Juicy Chicken Thigh Recipes That'll Save You From YourselfGallery13 SlidesBy Sarah JampelRecipes you want to make.
