I could no longer resist the constant stream of media fanfare about the \u201cscene.\u201d There were local culinary heroes (Danny Bowien; Stuart Brioza and Nicole Krasinski), destination-worthy neighborhood spots (Outerlands), third- wave coffee beaneries (Sightglass, Ritual), and the bakeries. So. Many. Bakeries. At the time, the city was even becoming famous for its toast. Toast!Our first stop was the mecca of Tartine Bakery in the Mission, where jet lag got us there before a line had formed. We picked out the famous morning bun, a ham-and-cheese croissant (the pain au jambon), and a chocolate croissant. Also a quiche and some still-warm brioche bread pudding, because you just never know! The bun certainly lived up to the hype, but Leo deemed the pain au jambon the \u201cwinner,\u201d and on the spot the two of us decided to compare it with every other ham-and-cheese croissant we encountered over the next five days.Our mission gave our days structure, and we stuck to a steady food-culture-culture-food rhythm, heading out with intention and then converting our high-fat, high-carb diet into spontaneous detours. On the way to Craftsman and Wolves, where the ham-and-cheese was a solid B+, we wandered into a cool taxidermy and artifacts store. We followed B. Patisserie\u2019s spectacular kouign-amann with a long walk to Golden Gate Park, descending from hot and sunny San Francisco spring weather to cold, wet, and windy San Francisco spring weather.There were no pins on my Google map for the moments I remember most clearly: the night we stayed in and read graphic novels because we were too full for dinner; the albino alligator at the California Academy of Sciences; Leo jumping the dunes at Ocean Beach; chatting with strangers in line at Swan Oyster Depot; walking the hairpin turns on Lombard Street. We needed a point A and a point B\u2014and the next croissant was as good a destination as any\u2014but the trip ended up being about everything that happened in between.Read more: Our Highly Subjective But Very Smart Guide to TravelingCheck out one of our favorite restaurants in SF:Explore Bon App\u00e9titSan FranciscoCroissantTartineTravelRecipes you want to make.
