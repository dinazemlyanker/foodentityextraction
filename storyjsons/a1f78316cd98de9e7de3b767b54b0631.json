Made it with tofu, but like the other reviewers said, I think it would be better with pork. With tofu, it's missing some umami. Based on another review, I tried adding some fish sauce and miso to replace that, but I think it could do with even more of a savory punch. I fried the eggplant for a while and then put it on a plate with a lid on top so that it would steam and get even softer.SamSeattle, WA9/9/2021Hmm. I also used crumbled tofu instead of pork.  (Not fond of pork grease and fat).It was delish.  I might up the sauce by a tablespoon or so.  AnonymousNY8/1/2021This is our favorite recipe. We could make it once a week for the rest of our lives. One thing I improvised was throwing the eggplant in the oven to broil on high while cooking the meat. I like that it gets a bit crispy this way. Danae D. Santa Monica, California 6/8/2021Made with tofu and thought it was a little bland. Ended up making a second batch of sauce and using it to up the flavor, so if you\u2019re gonna make it I would say use pork and up the sauce measurements. alliejaynedBrooklyn, NY9/18/2020We loved this! Like recipes that are veggie centric and use the meat as a Flavoring and not the main idea. Doubled the recipe. Added a few sliced scallions and a thinly sliced red pepper as we had those on hand  And served over basmati rice with a side of steamed bok  choy dressed with a ginger vinaigrette. Will repeat!Joanna HorobinBoston7/28/2020I am 13 and I decided to make this recipe and I definitely recommend it! It was super easy to make like 15~20 min, smelled and tasted great \ud83e\udd70\ud83d\udc96 MimiwikikiCalifornia 7/17/2020Really nice. Instead of pork I used a hand-chopped piece of chicken which I infused with a bit of fish sauce and soy sauce. Totally worked.\nQuestion: why wait to add the soy sauce and vinegar to the honey and chile mixture? Why not mix them all together at the same time? Is it to infuse the honey with the chiles? Does it really make any difference if you add the soy and vinegar later vs. when you first mix it? (Asking because I'm wondering if this is a \"thought through\" thing or just how it got written up for no particular reason.)AnonymousMontreal6/30/2020This is a delicious recipe. The rice vinegar & soy sauce(tamari) combination goes really well with the eggplant. Santi_MNYC, NY6/5/2020In quarantine cooking times, whenever I find myself with some ingredients I don't know what to do with, I turn to BA. This time, I had some ground pork, basil, and eggplant, and this recipe popped up. Although I ended up using a pound of ground pork, and a little more eggplant, the recipe was still delicious, and would be great over rice, or over soba noodles with a jammy egg, as my husband and I did with the leftover. Super easy and quick. Would recommend. buonjonnaAllentown, PA4/23/2020Its really really good! We ate it with some basmati rice.AnonymousToronto4/6/2020This is pretty tasty! I upped the pork so it was more of a 1:1 ratio of the eggplant and meat. Quick and easy.AnonymousNew York3/13/2020Just made this for the second time this week, extra-firm tofu in place of pork, maple syrup sub for honey, and with a bit of miso paste added is INCREDIBLE. Thank you Chris for making recipes that are vegan-friendly and delicious. \ud83e\udd70Anonymous1/3/2020LOVE this recipe, fast, easy and so flavourful. We ate it with jasmine rice and pea shoots. I would recommend doubling for leftovers. Don't sleep on the fresh basil!Anonymoustoronto10/11/2019fairly bland tbhtastyrecipespls9/15/2019Didn't have basil, added fresh ginger to the sauce instead. Served it over brown rice and topped it with a poached egg and scallions. The sauce is delish and this makes excellent leftovers.
