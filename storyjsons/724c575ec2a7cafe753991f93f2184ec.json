It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve been thinking about a lot lately, considering my quarantine buddy/husband\u2019s birthday was last weekend. We\u2019ve been to a number of Zoom surprises over these past couple months, so that was off limits. He also insisted he didn\u2019t want to do anything at all\u2014which\u2026 sure, okay, right.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!But even after the other details got worked out (a take-out bagel in the morning, a masked jog to our friends\u2019 window in the afternoon), I still wondered about the cake. I wanted to make a layer cake\u2014it\u2019s a birthday, isn\u2019t it?\u2014without making a dessert to feed 15. I landed on this amusing solution: I baked one round cake (this excellent yellow one from Food52), then punched out smaller circles with a biscuit cutter. I stacked them atop each other and glued everything together with the chocolate cream cheese frosting from Basically\u2019s birthday cake.It may be tiny, but this cake is still a standout.\nPhoto and Food Styling by Sarah JampelThe result was a precariously tall, very unbalanced cake that kinda looked like a mini tree stump and fed us over four days instead of 20. It felt sufficiently festive and appropriately strange.A small-but-tall slice.\nPhoto and Food Styling by Sarah Jampel\u201cWas this the best birthday ever?\u201d I asked him. \u201cWell, no, but that\u2019s okay,\u201d he replied. I\u2019m taking that as a success, and I\u2019m crediting the cake. Here\u2019s what else I\u2019ve been up to this week:One Good TipLeftover LandThere is no clearer example of entropy than my refrigerator, which devolves into chaos no matter how often I organize it. (Scientists, don\u2019t fact check me.) To impose some order to the madness, I\u2019ve started to corral all of the leftovers into one area: \u201cleftover land.\u201d This way, it\u2019s obvious when there\u2019s a lingering cup or two of squash au vin that should be taken care of before I embark on another stew. And when I\u2019ve accumulated lots of random grains and lentils and beans that don\u2019t amount to a full meal on their own, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll follow Sohla El-Waylly\u2019s lead and make koshari.Spring-y pasta never goes out of style.\nPhoto and Food Styling by Sarah JampelThe Best Thing I Ate This WeekJust Don\u2019t Call It PrimaveraThere\u2019s something very retro about pasta primavera\u2014perhaps because it was invented not in Italy but in North America in the \u201970s and sometimes involves broccoli and red peppers. But I still find the idea of sweet spring veg in a creamy lemony sauce extremely appealing. This week, I thinly sliced the two giant leeks that\u2019d been stinkin\u2019 up the fridge, then melted them down in butter until super soft before adding sliced asparagus and frozen peas. Once the veg was crisp-tender and bright green, I stirred in 12 ounces of al dente pasta, a heap of grated parm, and a few tablespoons of cream and mixed vigorously until the noodles were coated. Finishing touches: lemon zest, lemon juice, parsley, and then, once in bowls, a sprinkle of smoky, fruity black urfa chile from Burlap and Barrel.Moment of AppreciationThe Quiet HourEvery morning my cat wakes me up between 5:45 and 6 a.m., the point at which he simply cannot wait any longer for breakfast (I can empathize). Because this is aggravating but impossible to prevent, I\u2019m trying to choose my attitude: So I get out of bed, appease him, and then, against all recommendations, crawl back into bed, where I spend one uninterrupted hour reading a book (right now, that\u2019s Three Women by Lisa Taddeo). With most of the time zone asleep, it\u2019s the only time of day I feel no need to read the news, trawl for new content, or respond to emails.Photo and Food Styling by Sarah JampelAnd then when that hour is up, it\u2019s still only seven. The rest of the morning sprawls out in front of me! This week I made granola (my go-to is this one, but I use oats in place of half of the nuts) and radish and carrot pickles before 8. This is quite often the most productive part of my day (don\u2019t tell my boss).Recipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
