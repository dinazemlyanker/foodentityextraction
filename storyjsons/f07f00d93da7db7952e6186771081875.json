The day-after brunch. Family fun. Whatever you\u2019re up to this year, we\u2019ve got drinks and snacks for that.By Elyse InamineDecember 1, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailPhotographs by Emma FishmanFacebookTwitterEmailImagine with us: You\u2019re throwing your first holiday cocktail party in what is actually years. You\u2019re not really sure how to socialize again and you start spiraling (welcome to the club!). Then you watch your guests start gravitating to the bar and something changes. Your bestie pours a cup of punch for someone they just met, two acquaintances bond over a shared secret (they\u2019re just here for the food), and a characteristically quiet friend is suddenly regaling a small crowd with stories of holidays past. Look at that: You\u2019re hosting! Listen, we get it. Diving back into the festive spirit feels weird after such a looooong hiatus, which is why we\u2019ve done the heavy lifting for you. Read on for our favorite cocktail party menus.TBH, the party is still goingSometimes the party spills over into the next day, which is what inspired this hair-of-the-dog menu. It begins with the necessary carbs to soften the blow of last night\u2019s decisions. We\u2019re talking salty-sweet scones that balance caramelly dates with funky Gorgonzola and curried egg tartines that your guests can assemble themselves once they roll out of bed. But the star of this menu picks up where the party left off: a celery and salted lemon vodka soda anchored by the most ridiculous (and fortifying) garnish\u2014whatever tinned seafood you have (mussels, boquerones), pickled chiles, a cube of Manchego, and a big lemon wedge. Ah, the holidays.Celery and Salted Lemon CocktailThis brunch cocktail uses 8 celery stalks so, if you ignore the vodka, it\u2019s basically spa water.View RecipeDate and Gorgonzola SconesAs good with a cocktail as they are with tea or coffee, these mostly savory scones are perfect for a hair-of-the-dog brunch when the party continues into the next day.View RecipeCurried Egg Tartines\u00a0Fried bread is good. A slice of fried bread piled with creamy, curried egg salad is even better.\u00a0View RecipeMy family is \u201cjust dropping by\u201dSometimes your people come around unannounced and hungry and you need to get it together fast (i.e., before Aunt Mabel starts giving everyone her unsolicited opinions). The key to unlocking this off-the-cuff intimacy is a festive (and bottomless) punch paired with satisfying snacks that come together while everyone\u2019s milling around the kitchen watching you cook: a maple-za\u2019atar kettle corn and a burbling skillet of French-onion-soup-inspired dip.Cranberry Rum PunchThis rum punch is very simple to throw together, but cranberry-studded ice makes it feel deceptively fancy, doubling as a festive garnish and temperature control.View RecipeCreamy French Onion DipThe love child of French onion soup and French onion dip. Need we say more?View RecipeMaple-Za\u2019atar Kettle CornKettle corn is undeniably delicious, so there\u2019s no reason to mess with it\u2014unless the alternative is utterly showstopping. Enter this maple-za\u2019atar kettle corn.View RecipeI just wanna chill with my number-onesIf having just a few friends over is more your speed, we got you. Not every cocktail party needs to be boisterous or even boozy. Instead, invite your pod (remember those?!) or a few folks you haven\u2019t been able to spend enough time with for a cozy gathering. Catch up and stay clearheaded throughout the night with this zero-proof spiced blood orange shrub (but if you want a little something-something, just add 1.5 ounces of vodka or whiskey to each glass). Here we\u2019re taking things slow, sinking into conversations we\u2019ve missed, snacking on fried olives and meaty skewers, and letting the night guide us.Spiced Blood Orange ShrubRefreshing, alcohol-free (just don\u2019t call it a mocktail), and a noble destiny for that bag of citrus hanging out in the fridge.View RecipeCrispy Olives With Calabrian Chile SauceTake olives from snack to PARTY snack by coating them in panko and deep-frying them until golden brown and shatteringly crisp.View RecipePeppery Antipasto SkewersRib eye makes these antipasto skewers extra special, but there\u2019s lots of room to play around with proteins, cheeses, and briny bits.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCultureHoliday DrinksCocktailappetizerRead MorecookingAyesha Curry\u2019s Jubilant Holiday FeastGallery5 SlidesBy Ayesha Curry and Nico Avallerecipes47 Easy Cookie Recipes You\u2019ll Make on RepeatGallery47 SlidesBy Alyse Whitneyrecipes70 Healthy Christmas Recipes That Are as Festive as 'Jingle Bells'Gallery70 SlidesBy Alyse WhitneyRecipes you want to make.
