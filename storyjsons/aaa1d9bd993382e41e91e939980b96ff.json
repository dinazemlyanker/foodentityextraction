(The shell-shaped sugar topping to these classic Mexican sweet breads also come in fun colors, but those are usually vanilla in disguise.) For concha fanatic Rick Martinez, the question was always why couldn\u2019t he have both? \u201cFor those who want a little bit of everything (like me),\u201d Rick says, \u201cI give you La Concha Negra y Blanca.\u201d It\u2019s a fun little play on New York\u2019s famous Black-and-White cookie, amped up with lots of chocolate and vanilla flavor. Note that Rick recommends using vanilla paste (we like the one from\u00a0Heilala), which holds onto its flavor better than extract or beans when heated, and Dutch-process cocoa, which lends\u00a0a deeper, richer chocolate flavor than regular cocoa.IngredientsMakes 12Dough1\u00bc-oz. envelope active dry yeast (about 2\u00bc tsp.)\u00bdcup warm whole milk (about 110\u00b0)3large eggs, room temperature6Tbsp. (75 g) granulated sugar2tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1\u00bc tsp. Morton kosher salt3Tbsp. nonfat dry milk powder3cups (375 g) bread flour, plus more for surface10Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into 10 even pieces, room temperatureTopping and assembly1cup plus 1 Tbsp. (133 g) all-purpose flour\u2154cup (73 g) powdered sugar\u00bdcup ghee, refined coconut oil, or vegetable shortening, melted and cooled1tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt1tsp. vanilla paste or extract1Tbsp. unsweetened cocoa powder, preferably Dutch-process1large eggPreparationDoughStep 1Whisk yeast and milk in the bowl of a stand mixer to combine. Let sit 10 minutes for yeast to dissolve.Step 2Whisk eggs, granulated sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Add egg mixture, milk powder, and 3 cups bread flour to yeast mixture. Stir with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms. Fit bowl onto stand mixer fitted with dough hook and mix on medium speed until dough comes together but is still slightly tough, about 3 minutes. Increase speed to medium high and beat, adding butter a piece at a time and waiting until absorbed before adding the next piece, until dough is smooth, elastic, and very tacky but pulls away from sides of bowl (dough will look broken as you add the butter, but don\u2019t worry; it will eventually come together), about 15 minutes. This may seem like a long knead time, but it will improve the final texture of the bread.Step 3Cover bowl tightly and chill until doubled in volume, at least 12 hours. Letting dough rise in the fridge for a longer period of time will produce a dough with the best flavor, but if you don\u2019t have the time, cover dough and let rise in a warm (about 80\u00b0 is ideal), draft-free spot until doubled in volume, 35\u201350 minutes. The visual cue is more important here than the time. How long your dough takes to proof will depend on how warm your kitchen is. You don\u2019t want to overproof the dough, so check it at 35 minutes. Finished dough will smell buttery and yeasty and have doubled in size. If it is not there, check again in 10 minutes.Step 4Gently deflate dough by pressing it down and folding it over onto itself. Repeat until completely deflated.Step 5Do ahead: Dough can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled (do not deflate until ready to form into rolls).Topping and AssemblyStep 6Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Beat flour, powdered sugar, ghee, salt, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until combined and smooth. Transfer half of sugar topping to a small bowl. Add cocoa powder to remaining sugar topping and beat on medium-low speed to combine. Divide both vanilla and chocolate sugar toppings into 12 equal pieces (about 15 g each). Gently roll 1 vanilla ball and 1 chocolate ball into a single ball, making sure to keep colors from blending. Repeat with remaining balls and transfer to a plate. Cover loosely and let sit until ready to use.Step 7Turn out dough onto a work surface and divide into 12 equal pieces (about 80 g each). Working one at time, rest a cupped hand over dough so your palm and fingers enclose it and vigorously work your hand in a circular motion on the counter to shape dough into a smooth, round ball (the friction between the dough and the work surface will create tension, stretching dough into a taut dome). Transfer to prepared baking sheets. Arrange 6 balls on each, spacing evenly apart.Step 8Beat egg with 1 Tbsp. water in a small bowl to blend and brush 1 dough ball with egg wash. Using kitchen shears, cut open the sides of a small resealable plastic bag so that it opens up like a book. Place 1 piece of sugar topping on 1 side of open bag and fold other side over to cover. Using a small skillet or saucepan, press down on ball to flatten into a 4\"-diameter disk. Carefully peel open bag and invert disk onto dough ball; fit it to the dough so it covers the top and sides of ball completely without overlaps. Carefully remove bag. Using a rubber spatula, scrape off any topping stuck to bag and repeat process with remaining egg wash, dough balls, and sugar topping. Let conchas rise in a warm, draft-free spot until almost doubled in size, about 1\u00bd\u20132 hours (if dough was proofed at room temperature, this may only take 1 hour).Step 9Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 325\u00b0. Select a starting point on left side of dough, and, using a razor or sharp paring knife, very lightly score half-moon lines into topping so they radiate out across topping, starting from the same point and spacing about \u2153\u201d apart. You want to be careful not to deflate the dough, so don\u2019t press down and let the weight of the knife do the cutting (you don\u2019t need to cut through the topping).Step 10Place 1 baking sheet of conchas in the fridge and bake the other sheet until dough is golden brown, topping is very lightly darkened, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 195\u00b0, 20\u201330 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes on baking sheet, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely. Repeat with remaining baking sheet of conchas.Step 11Do ahead: Conchas can be baked 3 days ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.Photo by Emma Fishman, food styling by Pearl JonesHow would you rate Black-and-White Conchas?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (11)Back to TopTriangleI have made these probably a dozen times and they are absolutely phenomenal. They turn out to be perfectly sweet, airy, delicate, and absolutely delicious. I highly recommend making these if all you have ever had are the store-bought ones, it is so worth it to make them from scratchGarrett DullinColorado Springs, CO11/24/2021I can't wait to make them.  It's a long process and would really have liked a video with the instructions.  Videos always make the recipes easier to understand and visual makes it less difficult to make. AnonymousBakersfield, CA7/12/2021These turned out beautifully! I had some issues with the topping cracking as I was putting it on the rolls, but they still looked good and tasted great. Anonymous9/21/2020The first two times I've made these, I had bread flour, but no milk powder. And they turned out perfect! I read a review that said score the topping before the second rise, so that's what I've been doing and they turn out great. The third time I've made them (don't judge me, it's quarantine), I had milk powder, but only AP flour. And the dough was WAY too sticky. I added maybe a third of a cup of extra flour until the consistency looked right - and they turned out fine! The ultimate test was on Mother's Day when I presented these to my born-in-Mexico mom who immediately ordered a batch for the following week. AnonymousLos Angeles, CA7/19/2020I don\u2019t know what happened to my conchas, they spread out too much. They looked like concha cookies :( I think that maybe I didn\u2019t weigh the flour correctly and put too little. They tasted really good tho babybokchoySan Diego, CA5/2/2020Definitely a project kind of recipe, but so worth it! I used oatmilk instead of whole, and buttermilk powder instead of nonfat dry milk powder, since that's what I had on hand.  I did have some trouble with the topping-ended up using my hands (floured) instead of a pan because I couldn't get the topping off the plastic when I used a pan, and the topping separated a bit more than I think it was supposed to in the rising/baking process, but that was probably all user error. Regardless, they were delicious and I'm currently trying to resist the urge to stuff them all in my face.AnonymousLos Angeles, CA4/26/2020I have not eaten many conchas in my life, so I can't say these are the best ever, but eating a warm bun after a long day in lock-down was the little bit of joy that I needed. This was a project-y recipe, but the instructions are clear. The most difficult part is getting a method down for forming/placing the sugar coating on the buns (I used flour to keep the sugar discs from sticking to the plastic wrap, but I wish I would have also tried powdered sugar.)AnonymousGahanna, Ohio4/21/2020These were a fun project recipe and they turned out delicious!  The internal temperature point was very helpful, I'd love to see this in more recipes.  \n\nI would consider scoring the surface before their second rise.  Mine turned out with much more ~natural~ looking cracks because the shells broke as the dough rose.  GINGERWHISKEYOmaha, NE3/29/2020These are fantastic. I\u2019ve grown up eating conchas and some of my best memories are sitting with my grandma having pan de dulce with coffee in the morning.  I have tried many several recipes to make conchas at home, but none have been quite right. Except for this one. They were fairly straightforward to make but absolutely delicious. They have a rich milky flavor and the topping isn\u2019t too sweet but full of flavor. The blend of white and chocolate is also just visually beautiful.  I can\u2019t wait to make these over and over again for my family for years to come. Rick, you need to come out with a cookbook asap!! AnonymousAustin, TX3/27/2020Delicious! Simple recipe, just takes time as with any bread. Used a tortilla press for the topping and it was super easy! Was fun making my own conchas. allegra_barraganFort Worth, TX3/22/2020These are both beautiful and delicious! Instructions are very clear, and I did end up using waxed paper instead of a sandwich bag for the topping since that was what I had on hand - it worked out pretty well.
