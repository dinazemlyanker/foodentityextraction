And then there\u2019s the kind of drink you make yourself when you\u2019ve got some time, maybe some friends are coming over, or maybe you\u2019re on vacation and want to fully embody the vacation version of yourself. A tiki drink is in order.That drink is the Bird of Paradise, a rum, Aperol, and pineapple juice cocktail from Alex Holder, the assistant beverage director of McGuire Moorman Hospitality and the brains behind the sunset-orange drink served at the tiki-themed Pool Burger in Austin.Chill vibes at Pool Burger in Austin.\nPhoto by Wynn Myers\u201cThis is a riff on a classic tiki drink called the Jungle Bird,\u201d says Holder, \u201cbut we sort of flip-flopped the recipe for Pool Burger. We use a higher proof rum than usual for packing a bigger punch, but then instead of Campari, which imparts a particularly bitter taste, we use Aperol, which is a bit tamer.\u201d The pineapple, lime, and simple syrup are there to balance everything with some acidity and sweetness. Here\u2019s how you can make it at home:Combine \u00bd cup sugar and \u00bc cup water in a jar, cover, and shake until sugar is dissolved to make the simple syrup (you could also make simple syrup over the stove until dissolved, if you prefer). Then combine 1 oz. Aperol, 1 oz. overproof rum, 1 oz. pineapple juice, \u00bd oz. fresh lime juice, and \u00bc  oz. simple syrup in a cocktail shaker filled with ice. Cover and shake vigorously for 30 seconds. Strain into a glass filled to the brim with crushed ice. The fresher the pineapple juice you can get, the better (Holder is partial to Trader Joe\u2019s brand). This recipe yields 1 cocktail.As for garnishes, Holder\u2019s got some strong opinions there, too. \u201cTiki drinks are all about embellishing and over-exaggerating the look,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could go with pineapple leaves or a pineapple wedge, of course, which both pop against the color of the drink. Or stick as many swizzle sticks or colorful straws as you have in there.\u201d The most over-the-top idea, though? Take half of a juiced lime and place it on the very top (it shouldn\u2019t sink because of all that crushed ice), and then prick the top with a little toothpick flag. It looks like a mini island! In this case it\u2019s not so much go big or go home\u2014it\u2019s go big at home.Get the recipe:Bird of ParadiseThis easy summer tiki cocktail is made with Aperol, rum, and pineapple juice.View RecipeAnother tropical drink for your pleasure:Recipes you want to make.
