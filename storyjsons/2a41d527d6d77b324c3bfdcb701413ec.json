I watched NSYNC on TRL because that\u2019s what my teenage sister did, and I loved cooking with my mom and aunties because it made me feel mature. I begged my parents for the O.G. Easy-Bake Oven\u2014baking brownies for the neighborhood kids (the little dears) felt like a very adult thing to do. These days kids still want to feel older\u2014as confirmed by my niece\u2014but they\u2019re a little more advanced. Play kitchens and light bulb\u2013powered ovens? Please. Instead, young chefs are interested in baking cupcakes from scratch, cooking with real spices, and using their own dedicated knife set.
