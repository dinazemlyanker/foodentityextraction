Sea bream, common in the Mediterranean, has lean flesh with a light, delicate flavor. If you can\u2019t find it, porgy or snapper are suitable subs. For a long, lazy lunch menu serve this crudo alongside tomatoes and haricots verts, handmade malfatti, grilled turbot, and tiramis\u00f9 with cookies.Ingredients8 servings2plum tomatoes, halved crosswiseKosher salt\u00bdlemon1\u00bdlb. highest-quality sea bream, skin, bones, and blood lines removed1\u00bdcups arugula\u2153cup Ni\u00e7oise olives\u00bdsmall red onion, very thinly sliced\u00bdcup fresh lemon juiceExtra-virgin olive oil (for drizzling)Flaky sea saltPreparationStep 1Grate tomatoes on a box grater until all the flesh is grated and there is just skin left; discard skin.
