See our past recommendations here!There\u2019s a routine to my September\u2014switching from iced tea back to hot, rotating fall jackets to the front of the closet, and preserving food with a zeal both obsessive and slightly desperate. I buy boxes of imperfect Romas to make tomato sauce, fill my freezer with spent cobs for future corn stock, and jar as much peach jam as will fit in my pantry. These are my insurance policies against the relentlessness of New York winter, the late summer nuts I unearth in January and February like a seasonally depressed squirrel.While I don\u2019t know if Malin+Goetz had me specifically in mind when developing its limited edition tomato candle, I appreciate having another way to sock away a bit of summer for the cold days ahead. The vegetable wax candle bursts with floral green abundance, like a garden baking in the hot afternoon sun. There\u2019s green pepper base notes, lavender top notes, and sandwiched somewhere in the middle, subtle enough not to be polarizing, is the scent that clings to your fingers when you rub a tomato leaf\u2014sharp and verdant with a hint of gasoline. It smells like freshly laundered sheets hung out to dry in a greenhouse.The 9-oz. candle has a burn time of 60 hours, so I figure if I limit myself to half an hour a day, that\u2019ll take me from December straight through to March, at which point ramp season will rescue me from winter despair. And, like late summer\u2019s heirloom tomatoes, it\u2019ll only be around for another couple of weeks, so get it before it's gone.Emma FishmanTomato Candle$55 at (MALIN+GOETZ)Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishTomatoSummerHealthyish Loves ItShoppingWinterRecipes you want to make.
