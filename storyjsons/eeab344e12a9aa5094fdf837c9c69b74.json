It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.I have made the best dish of my life (so far), and my coworker refuses to publish it. Today, I take matters into my own hands.A few months ago, on a weeknight, I came home with some cheddar cheese left over from a Trader Joe\u2019s shoot, and without thinking about it, paired it with a head of broccoli that was in the fridge.I was hungry, and I had cheese, and cheese goes with broccoli, and that\u2019s all the inspiration I needed. Urgently, I started cooking without a plan. \u201cBroccoli takes a while to cook,\u201d I said to no one, \u201cso I should get it going, no matter what happens next.\u201dWant this letter before it hits the website?

I set my trusty 10\u201d cast-iron skillet over a medium-high flame, then I turned to my cutting board and started butchering the broccoli. I separated the crown from the stalk, then cut the florets into big wedges. I trimmed and peeled the stem, then cut it crosswise into large coins. The pan was hot by now, so I drizzled in enough olive oil to coat, then added the broccoli, seasoned it with salt, and arranged it so the flat sides made contact with the pan.I brushed the loose bits of broc off of my cutting board and got going with the cheddar, an aged and very crumbly specimen. I broke about 4 ounces of it into \u00bd-inch bits, scooted them back into a pile.I checked on the broccoli, which was developing a nice dark brown seared edge on one side and turning bright green and steamy on the top. Without even knowing what would happen next, I sprinkled the cheddar all over the broccoli. Immediately the cheese started to soften, and the pieces that tumbled onto the pan\u2019s surface started to bubble and crisp. In a minute or two, the green broccoli hill tops were blanketed in melty cheddar and there were islands of cheese frico all over the pan.Photo by Carla Lalli MusicQuickly, I grabbed a plate and served myself some of the Broccoli Delight. \u201cIs this a deconstructed broccoli gratin?\u201d I asked the universe. I sprinkled some crushed red pepper flakes onto the broccoli and added a squeeze of fresh lemon. Did I just invent cruciferous cheese crispies, or is this just cheesy broccoli?These are existential questions, and Broccoli Delight is the answer. The next day I came to work and told everyone about it. Amiel Stanek, editor of Basically, was so taken with my tale that he asked me to write an actual recipe for Broccoli Delight. That was months ago. The recipe remains under seal. Amiel won\u2019t answer my calls. I made it again last night and my child told me it\u2019s the best thing I\u2019ve ever made. I have made a lot of things for him. I feel the need to share. Broccoli Delight may be an unpublished recipe, but the expos\u00e9 is here.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterBroccoliRead MorecookingFood Tastes Better When You Shop SmarterBy Carla Lalli MusicRecipes you want to make.
