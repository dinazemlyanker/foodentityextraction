Panzanella, a Tuscan salad made with tomatoes and stale bread soaked in vinaigrette, has never been my thing, thanks to one too many soggy-bread, underripe-tomato experiences at the mediocre Italian restaurants of my youth. But fried-bread panzanella? With ricotta? From Drifters Wife in Portland, ME\u2014#9 on Bon App\u00e9tit's Hot 10 this year? It\u2019s not every day you get to fry bread and call it a salad. I was convinced.This panzanella recipe rises to genius status thanks to one technique: Whereas most panzanella recipes call for stale white bread, this one calls for fresh sourdough, which you then fry in thick slices on one side only. This partial-fry method lets half the bread pull in the vinegary juices of the tomato salad, while the other half stays crunchy like a giant homemade crouton. (Don\u2019t freak out; we\u2019re not deep frying here. It\u2019s just a few tablespoons of oil in a skillet.) Then the beautiful half-browned bread gets cut into large chunks and tossed with the healthy stuff: tomatoes, red wine vinegar, shallot, garlic, and herbs. This alone would be my new favorite salad recipe, but then comes the ricotta, the feather bed of cheeses. Stirred with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper, it gets spread over the plate before the salad gets poured on top in all its juicy, crispy, herby glory.It\u2019s the kind of recipe that this wine bar turned restaurant excels at: simple at first glance, eye-openingly good at first bite. With such a small menu, every dish at Drifters Wife has to deliver, from the roasted eggplant with cashew butter to the olive oil cake with yogurt, and this panzanella is no exception. You start to eat it politely with a fork and knife, but within minutes you go back to the platter with your fingers, dragging wedges of salty, half-crisp, half-soaked sourdough through puddles of ricotta, piling chunks of tomato on top, and eating it in one bite like reconstructed tomato toast. It\u2019s a square meal if you want it to be, or you can pair it with Drifters Wife\u2019s cast-iron chicken or another protein of your choice. Either way, it\u2018s fried bread and it\u2019s also salad, which counts as a proper dinner for me.Get the recipe:Fried-Bread Panzanella with Ricotta and HerbsTraditional panzanella is amped up by frying thick slices of bread in olive oil on only one side, achieving a combination of crisp and soft that soaks up all the tomato juices without getting soggy.View RecipeAnother great dinner salad:Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladBreadHot 10Recipes you want to make.
