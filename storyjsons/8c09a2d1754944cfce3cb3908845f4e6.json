Next up is Dana Frank, owner of beloved Portland natural wine spot Bar Norman and founder of The Wild Bunch wine fair.I met Dana Frank across an endless bounty of flaky khachapuri at Pheasant\u2019s Tears Winery in Sighnaghi, Georgia. We belonged to a sundry crew of wine directors, writers, and enthusiasts that had flown across the globe to dive into the rich viniculture of the country that produced the world\u2019s first vintage over 8,000 years ago. In between long-winded toasts and generous refills of amber wine, Frank\u2019s jovial, inquisitive nature fostered the kind of open conversation typically reserved for one\u2019s inner circle. By the end of the supra, a traditional Georgian feast, we\u2019d gone from virtual strangers to fast friends.Turns out, Frank has a penchant for making people feel at ease around wine: As the owner of the natural wine bar Bar Norman in Portland, OR, and prominent feature in the city\u2019s burgeoning wine scene, she does so on a daily basis. The former wine director of Ava Gene\u2019s, Frank co-authored the cookbook Wine Food and owns Bow & Arrow with her husband, winemaker Scott Frank, in the Willamette Valley. Their eight-year-old Orly can\u2019t legally partake in the family business just yet, but she\u2019ll definitely talk your ear off about the next vintage of her imaginary cuv\u00e9e.But wine didn\u2019t always permeate every aspect of Frank\u2019s life. Upon returning to the U.S., Frank made her way into restaurants. It wasn\u2019t until she started working front-of-house at Merenda in Bend, OR that her attention turned to wine. \u201cI hadn\u2019t really thought a whole lot about wine, then I stumbled into this progressive program run by young, interesting people\u2014the antithesis of what I understood wine to be,\u201d she says, \u201cI found it to be completely engrossing:  No matter how hard I tried, I could never learn everything there was to know.\u201dThese days, Frank is most often spotted at Bar Norman, enthusiastically greeting regulars, writing out the day\u2019s by-the-glass menu (which often reaches 30+ wines) in chalk, and replenishing the eclectic assortment of to-go bottles as music blasts through the hi-fi speakers. Named for her grandfather, Bar Norman was born out of a desire to create a space that champions inclusivity over correctness: \u201cWhen I started working in wine, it was about learning as much as possible, getting really nerdy and \u2018talking wine\u2019 like everyone else,\u201d Frank says, \u201cNow, I\u2019m in a totally different place: I want to make the conversation that surrounds wine less intimidating, more fun, and easier to understand.\u201dTo that end, the bar\u2019s calendar is packed with community-centric events that frequently have educational or activist slants. On any given night, there could be a skin contact-themed dance party, a Hummus Hang pop-up, or a cookbook launch for Alison Roman\u2019s Nothing Fancy. During a recent Trash the Tariffs fete, the local wine industry gathered in solidarity to sign letters to local congresspeople to protest Trump\u2019s proposed 100% tax on European wine imports. Frank may have set the stage, but only so that she could invite everyone to join her on it.Right now, Frank is putting the finishing touches on Portland\u2019s inaugural natural wine fair and food market, The Wild Bunch, happening this Sunday, March 1st. We caught up with her about her love of Nigerian music, taking a leap of faith on Bar Norman, and why she\u2019s feeling more empowered now than ever before.The Wild Bunch was created to\u2026celebrate winemakers, importers, and artisans from around the world in Portland. Even though we\u2019re in the middle of wine country, Portland has been focused on beer and cocktails for so long and been relatively disconnected from wine culture. We wouldn\u2019t be where we are in Oregon without the history of wine in Europe. We want people to be able to discover wines that would otherwise take them months or years to try if they were buying full bottles. It\u2019s for anyone that\u2019s interested in wine, especially natural wine, and likes to have a good time. Also, who doesn\u2019t like a party?Wine has the power to\u2026help us understand the world better. It\u2019s a way to connect with other people and places throughout history as part of our everyday lives.I decided to open Bar Norman because... I thought that if I didn\u2019t do it, someone else was going to do it. Up until this point, I had never had much of an entrepreneurial spirit. I was always very afraid of failure and rejection. Before I was about to open the bar, all of those lingering doubts disappeared and I felt like I had to do it.Right before we opened\u2026my sister Linsey gave me a framed copy of \u201cThe Man in the Arena\u201d by Teddy Roosevelt, which hangs next to my mirror. I look at it every morning to remind me that there are going to be critics and people that don\u2019t agree with the choices that I've made, but at the end of the day the only person I have to answer to is myself: If I\u2019m not trying and not failing then what am I doing?One of my greatest pleasures is\u2026 growing up with my daughter Orly. I\u2019m learning to be a better person by way of raising her.I\u2019m nourished by\u2026the people in my life, both my family at home and my family at Bar Norman. I feel so grateful to work with the people that I do everyday and share that space with them. I\u2019m grateful to work with people that are so good\u2014good at their jobs, sure, but just good people.My connection between wine and music...is through my husband Scott because he\u2019s the reason that my life is full of good music. There\u2019s no day without music anymore; it\u2019s constantly playing in the house, in the car, and in the bar all of the time. I have a deep love of Ethiopian and Nigerian music, as well as R&B\u2014mostly whatever Scott is listening to, I\u2019m listening to. I actually appreciate the times that are quiet because they\u2019re so few and few between.I\u2019m inspired by\u2026the next generation of womxn in their teens, 20s, and 30s who are pushing against the patriarchy, knowing it\u2019s the only way forward. Certainly I have bold, outspoken colleagues my age and older (and thank god for them!), but I'm from a generation of industry professionals that was accustomed to being bossed around by men. Now, I'm feeling more empowered to stand up for myself and other womxn around me. I don't want to ever feel like I can't speak my mind. Been there, done that.I started running\u2026 on a whim. I had always thought I didn\u2019t like running, but I knew that I needed something to get me moving again after having my daughter and I couldn\u2019t figure out how to fit anything else in. Running was simply a matter of putting on shoes and going out the door. Going out for a two  or three  hour run was the only time I had to myself; I wasn\u2019t getting that space in any other way in my life.Cooking is how...I feel connected to the world. It\u2019s similar to the way I feel about wine. I focus most of the food that I make from places like the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Europe. I like to buy a cookbook or come back from a trip and delve deeply into that food culture.I\u2019m looking forward to\u2026the rest of my 40s. I am really loving and reveling in my life as it is right now. I feel like every year gets better because I'm learning so much about myself. I\u2019m in my 16th year of working in wine, Bar Norman is well into its second year, and I run a couple of different wine businesses. I\u2019m a mom and a wife.Right now, my focus is on... mentoring. I\u2019ve been so fortunate to have incredible mentors in my career and it\u2019s time to start giving some of that back. My goal is to help my vibrant, energetic staff, who have many more hours in their days than I do, find their own way in the world.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishnatural winePortlandPerson of InterestInterviewsRead MoreLifestyleJenny Lefcourt Won't Admit That She's the Reason You Drink Natural WineBy Marissa A.
