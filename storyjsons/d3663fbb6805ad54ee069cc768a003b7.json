No cheat codes. No timesavers. No boxes of Jiffy stacked up like overdue library books. To make the best damn cornbread and sausage stuffing you need to first make excellent homemade cornbread. And we won\u2019t budge about it. Return those overdue library books! Get some good cornmeal and a fresh pint of buttermilk, and let\u2019s do this thing.Reporting for duty.\nPhoto by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiThe Cornbread PartWhen Molly Baz was developing this classic Thanksgiving side recipe, she knew she\u2019d need to go all out to make sure this version was the best it could possibly be. Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen standards are normally high\u2014but for this holiday, they\u2019re higher than the freshly inflated Snoopy balloon at the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving parade. First, she\u2019d have to develop a cornbread recipe that\u2019s moist, not-to-sweet, and easy to slice and toast. This is cornbread specifically meant for stuffing, with less sugar than usual. By making homemade, you get to control the moisture and sugar levels, whereas so many cornbread stuffings made from a mix or store-bought cornbread can turn out mushy and pudding-like. We want actual bites of cornbread. The recipe is pretty simple: flour, cornmeal, buttermilk, sugar, salt, pepper, baking powder, eggs, butter. You can make it a day or two ahead, or just let it cool before the next part.Future cornbread croutons.\nPhoto by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiThe Toasted Cornbread PartThe cornbread is cut into cubes and toasted in the oven until it begins to dry out on the outside\u2014it takes close to an hour. They\u2019re sort of like cornbread croutons, and if it seems counter-intuitive after making that fresh cornbread, trust us: We don\u2019t want that mush! Toasting guarantees that the layer on top gets a crispy exterior, while the stuff inside will soak up all the stock and sausage goodness, also known as: perfect harmony.Lovely.\nPhoto by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen KaminskiThe Sausage PartyCook up some hot or sweet Italian sausage, followed by the aromatics\u2014onion, celery, garlic, rosemary, salt, and red pepper flakes\u2014and then collard greens in all that sausage fat. Cream and chicken broth join in to continue softening the greens, and then everything gets mixed together with the sausage, plus some eggs, and the cornbread. The whole mixture sits for five or ten minutes to allow the cornbread to absorb the good-good (official term), and since we toasting it earlier, it won\u2019t disintegrate to baby food in the process. Fret not!The Oven PartHalf of the cook time is under foil so the cornbread on top won\u2019t burn. But we want golden-brown crispy crunch, so remove the foil for the second half and keep a close eye!The Happy PartIs when you eat it.Get the recipe:Cornbread Stuffing with Sausage and Collard GreensYour whole kitchen is about to smell like a buttered corn muffin.
