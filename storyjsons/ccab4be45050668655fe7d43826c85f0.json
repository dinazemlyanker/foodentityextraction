This Recipe is the Best Place to StartAnd at the end you get soup.\u00a0By Sarah JampelJanuary 6, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Yekaterina BoytsovaFacebookTwitterEmailOnce upon a time\u2014actually not too long ago, but before I worked here at BA\u2014I decided that I was going to roast a chicken (I am a vegetarian) and feed it to my meat-eating friends. I thought I needed to know how to roast a chicken to be a fully-formed Adult. But even more importantly, I thought I needed to know how to carve one. So I bought kitchen shears, I watched this video of Chris Morocco roasting a chicken upwards of 50 times, and I prepared myself. And then, when the moment came, I dragged my most chicken-familiar friend into the kitchen and held him captive until he walked me through the process. It wasn\u2019t disastrous but it certainly wasn\u2019t cute\u2014let\u2019s just say my platter of carved meat wasn\u2019t a cover star.If I knew then what I know now (ah, the wisdom of retrospection), I wouldn\u2019t have gone from zero to roast chicken\u2014I would have gone from zero to boiled chicken. In other words, I would have started not with roast chicken but with chicken soup. When you poach a whole chicken, as you do at the start of Molly Baz\u2019s Classic Chicken Noodle Soup, you get a bird that\u2019s essentially falling apart at the seams (sorry\u2026). It\u2019s bending and flexing in all of the places you\u2019re going to slice. (Whatever you do, don't start by breaking down a raw chicken. It's even harder and, TBH, even more skeevy.)Here\u2019s how it works. Once your chicken breast has reached 155\u00b0 F (this seems a bit low, but remember that the meat is going back in the soup later), pull the chicken from the pot and transfer it to a cutting board to cool slightly, breast side up.Next, grab a wing and pull it outward, away from the body, so you can see where it attaches. Using a chef\u2019s knife, cut through the joint to separate the wing from the breast. You\u2019ll need to angle your knife downwards and toward the chicken\u2019s body, and you\u2019ll know you\u2019re in the wrong place if you hit bone\u2014simply pull the wing out farther, then wiggle your knife into the place where the joint meets the socket. Remove wing, repeat on the other side, then move on to the legs.Cut through the flap of skin that\u2019s shrouding the leg-body intersection (again, sorry\u2026), then pop the chicken leg backwards\u2014sort of like the bird is doing a hip-opening exercise\u2014so that you see its joint pop out. An open expanse of easily sliceable soft flesh between the joint and the body will be revealed\u2014cut through it. Repeat with the other leg.All that\u2019s left to do is to remove the breast. Keep in mind that you there\u2019s a bone running straight down the center\u2014you\u2019ll need to cut alongside it on the left and right, angling your knife toward the outside of the bird.At this point you may be staring at a sort of roughed-up carcass and some chicken parts that are far from picture-perfect. But that\u2019s the best part of carving a chicken for soup: It\u2019s just practice! It\u2019s all getting shredded up anyway and no one has to know that you didn\u2019t do the world\u2019s very best job.And the next time, when you try it with a roast chicken, you\u2019ll do even better.Get the recipe:Classic Chicken Noodle SoupThis chicken noodle soup recipe is about as comforting as they come.\u00a0View RecipeRecipes you want to make.
