Did some improvising and added some kimchi and a couple soft boiled eggs and it was quite delightful. This is for sure going to be a go-to dinner for me from here out, so easy and so good!SamuelWashington2/9/2021I don\u2019t like most oatmeal, but this was great. I used furikake as the topping with chili sauce. Burley BarnettTexas3/22/2020This was so amazing! we used black vinegar and I thought it was going to be over powering but it wasn't. such a nice flavor to cut through the richness! We had this a full meal so as suggested in the comments we added a soft boiled egg (definitely a must!) This recipe has made it into our top 10 dinners!AnonymousChicago1/23/2020I would die for Sohla. Made this several times already, sometimes getting lazy and going without the pickle. While it's great without, the pickles really add that perfect sparkle. Love how it's ingredients I usually have on hand combined just the right way. Add an egg, soft boiled or poached with the oats, for a beautiful day.AnonymousVancouver, Canada1/15/2020I was hesitant to try a savory oatmeal, but this was fantastic. The crunch and vinegar of the veg really brought it together.AnonymousDenver, CO12/10/2019Unbelievably flavorful and comforting. I'll be eating this all winter.AnonymousScottsdale, AZ12/10/2019Sohla! This was sooo good, like omg. Thank you. Up until now, I was kinda afraid of savoury porridge (dunno why, love congee, love sweet porridge, love em all), but this recipe made me curious and now I love it. This will become a part of my regular dishes to cook. IWriteReviewsNotTragedies12/9/2019I am very glad that I was able to get over the idea of a savory oatmeal.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and wouldn\u2019t change a thing. This was absolutely delicious.  It was mind expanding. solsrSanta Cruz, California 12/6/2019Just made it with buckwheat groats instead of oats, worked wonderfully. Thanks for the non-traditional combination tip! I kind of want to add dashi in everything now.AnonymousEstonia12/4/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titPorridgeOatRice & GrainsRadishVegetableCucumberMainHealthyishSimmerBreakfastDinnerRecipes you want to make.
