At home, he likes to make double or triple batches of the coconut milk curry (see his recipe for All-Purpose Coconut Curry here) and freeze it in two-cup portions. Then, when he\u2019s ready for dinner, all he has to do is reheat the prepared curry and roast some squash. If you want to prepare this recipe with premade curry, bring two cups curry to a gentle simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat, then add the roasted squash and cut green beans and simmer until the squash is warmed through and the green beans are tender.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Set aside.Curry and assemblyStep 2Heat grapeseed oil in a medium Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high. Add a few mustard seeds to pot. When seeds start to wiggle and pop, reduce heat to medium and add curry leaves (if using), asafetida (if using), and remaining mustard seeds. Cover pot and cook spices, swirling, until mustard seeds start popping more gradually, about 30 seconds. Uncover pot and return heat to medium-high. Add ginger and garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Add red onion and a big pinch of salt.

Bring curry to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, 10 minutes.Step 5Add green beans and reserved squash to curry. Return to a gentle simmer and cook until green beans are tender, 7\u201310 minutes. (If curry gets too thick, add a splash of hot water; curry should have consistency of heavy cream.)

Serve with rice and lime wedges for squeezing over.Do Ahead: Curry can be made 5 days ahead. Let cool, then transfer to an airtight container and chill.How would you rate Butternut Squash and Green Bean Stew?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (8)Back to TopTriangleMade this with purple cabbage subbed for green beans because that\u2019s what we had/is in season and it was incredible! Will 100% make again. Grace KBerkeley, CA1/26/2022I wish I'd re-read the notes about adding more spices to this stew. As written, the stew added up to less than the sum of its parts. Also, a tip for the unwary: mustard seeds pop just like popcorn in the hot oil. Have that lid ready to cover those little leaping seeds!KirstenWoodland Park, NJ1/16/2022It was wonderful once I added cumin, cinnamon, Aleppo pepper, and Kashimiri pepper. Otherwise, it was bland. It just needed a little heat and more aromatics. No doubt this could be made with other vegetables and also lentils and beans. Served over rice. It was a hit.BarbaraSoho1/5/2022So good, with a bit of added heat. Added some baked tofu (done at the same time as the squash), exchanged the green beans for peas, and added  hot curry powder instead of leaves and added some chili paste for warmth. But otherwise done as-is and it is really good!Vegfam01Detroit MI10/28/2021The curry base is very good but for my palate needs more spicing like chilli powder, cumin and coriander powder. With that, it becomes more complex and interesting.   Perhaps when we make the base for freezing we do it plain and for each dish, we add diff spices to it to make it taste diff.AnonymousRaleigh, NC10/24/2021The recipe itself is a good base - but it DEFINITELY needs a lot of doctoring. We added 1.5 tbsp Kalustyan house blend curry powder mix, a pinch of cinnamon, 0.5 tsp of cayenne, about 0.5 tsp maple syrup. With the added spices it is phenomenal but without those it\u2019s very bland and very one note.DevonyNew York, NY10/2/2021I went to the local Indian grocer and got all the ingredients. Still, it ended up tasting too sour and not very complex/spiced. I don't know what went wrong :(LizOttawa9/27/2021So, so tasty. Wasn\u2019t able to source the optional ingredients from my local grocery store, but I imagine they would add even more complexity. Might try a chili or two on my next pass.
