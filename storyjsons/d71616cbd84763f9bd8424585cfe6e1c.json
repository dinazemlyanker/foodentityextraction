It\u2019s a simple line of marketing copy, but it made me emit a small yelp of surprise. How often had I encountered a brand that presumed that Asian flavors taste like home?Omsom sells something it calls starters, which are essentially sauces with all the flavor components needed to make a specific Asian dish like bulgogi or larb. They come packaged in resealable pouches (which I prefer so I can customize the amount of seasoning I add to my dish) or single-use packets, and you can also buy sampler packs that showcase the flavors of East or Southeast Asia. The bright umami-rich Filipino sisig starter contains vinegar, garlic, mushroom powder, and calamansi pur\u00e9e. The Vietnamese lemongrass barbecue option has just the right amount of savory funk, thanks to Red Boat fish sauce, lemongrass, and oyster sauce. The Thai larb starter consists of not one but two packets, one with fish sauce, lime juice, sugar, and chili flakes and the other with toasted rice powder for that essential nutty flavor.Photo by Mischelle MoySoutheast Asian Omsom Sampler$29 at OmsomEach starter comes with instructions on how to make a composed dish using the seasoning packet. Although the recipes are simple, coming together in the time it takes to saut\u00e9 some meat and chop some veg, they\u2019re not dumbed down. Omsom doesn\u2019t assume that I would prefer a boneless, skinless chicken breast as the catchall protein (I would not). Several of the recipes call for pork belly\u2014eternally popular in many Asian cuisines, but aside from a brief brush with trendiness circa 2005, not a mainstream cut for many white Americans\u2014although if you\u2019d like to use the traditional pig\u2019s snout, cheeks, and ears for the sisig, I\u2019m sure Omsom would approve.Omsom's sisig seasoning packet in action\nPhoto by Jenny HuangFor those nights when even turning on the stove is too much meal prep, the latest addition to the Omsom family is a set of six starters (two each of the Vietnamese lemongrass barbecue, Korean bulgogi, and Chinese mala salad seasoning pouches) with recipes specifically created for Instant Pots and air fryers. They come together in a snap, and you can look forward to spicy bulgogi braised pork or crispy, air fried lemongrass cauliflower and mala chicken wings with little more work than pushing a button.\u00a0Instant Pot Omsom Sampler$29 at OmsomThat Omsom speaks with a decidedly Asian American voice is thanks to its founders, Vietnamese American sisters Kim and Vanessa Pham. To develop their starters, they sought out chefs who could deliver on Omsom\u2019s promise of \u201cno more diluted dishes, no more cultural compromise,\u201d including Amelie Kang of the M\u00e1L\u00e0 Project, Jimmy Ly of Madame Vo, and Chat and Ohm Suansilphong of Fish Cheeks. The results are so satisfying my only quibble is that I wish they came in family size jars; I'd save a space for a vat of the lemongrass barbecue starter right next to my 25 oz. jar of Lao Gan Ma chili crisp.If you\u2019re not used to having your experience centered, it can be giddy-making when you realize that a company is talking to you. And that can feel pretty radical if you\u2019ve spent a lifetime seeing grocery aisles full of \u201chomestyle\u201d chicken pot pie and \u201cgrandma\u2019s\u201d tomato sauce that don\u2019t particularly remind you of home or grandma. For us Asian kids, Omsom provides the shortcuts to nourishing, flavor-packed meals\u2014just like Mom used to make.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendRead Morecooking5 Spice Blends We Can Get BehindBy Sarah JampelRecipes you want to make.
