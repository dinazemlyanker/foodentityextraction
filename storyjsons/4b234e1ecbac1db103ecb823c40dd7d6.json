Yes, they need something else in their stomachs first.By Carla Lalli MusicOctober 31, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Sue LiFacebookTwitterEmailOf all the holidays to embrace and celebrate after becoming a parent, Halloween is pretty far down on my list. One year I got egged; I hate those Ghostface masks from Scream; and as a parent, the evening is an emotional roller coaster of anticipation, hysteria, and sugar-induced chaos.My older son has aged out of the whole trick-or-treat situation, but years of practice have afforded me a few battle-earned strategies on how to survive the evening. By strategies, I mean rules that help smooth out the edges, and by now my nine-year-old knows the drill. He must actually say the words \u201ctrick or treat\u201d and \u201cthank you.\u201d He can have one piece of candy per five city blocks, and then one a night till the haul is gone. Most important, though, he has to eat something \u201creal\u201d before heading out.What kid doesn\u2019t love peanut butter?\nPhoto by Alex LauSince this kid loves crunchy vegetables and is motivated by the promise of future rewards, if I throw together a plate of what we call \u201cdips\u201d while he\u2019s getting into costume, he will definitely chomp it up. This isn\u2019t dinner, exactly, but it\u2019s a decent foundation, and it supports one of my tenets of the balanced kid diet: If you offer children vegetables when they\u2019re hungry, they\u2019ll be way more likely to eat them. Plus, it\u2019s easy. Into a blender add 1 cup creamy natural peanut butter and add \u00bc cup fresh lime juice, 4 oz. silken tofu (yes, for protein, but it also helps make the dip super creamy), 1 Tbsp. soy sauce, and 2 Tbsp. honey. Then I peel and finely grate a 2\" knob of ginger, place it into a little sieve, and press on it with a spoon to release the juice into the blender too (discard the solids). I blend this on medium-high speed, along with about \u00bc cup hot tap water to get things moving. Taste and season with some salt. If I\u2019m serving with veggie and fruit spears, I\u2019ll keep it thick. For drizzling over crunchy romaine hearts, I\u2019ll thin it out a little more. Kids eat with their eyes probably more than anyone else\u2014an extra drizzle of honey or handful of seeds or nuts is my way to add flair. This dip keeps for several days in the fridge, and considering my son is also a vegetarian, it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s a filling, protein-boosted condiment on hand for any other afternoon.It takes five minutes to make this, and another five to cut up some cucumbers, carrots, and apples. If I\u2019m smart, I\u2019ll make sure to eat some too. It\u2019s going to be a long night.Get the recipe:Silky Peanut Butter DressingAdding silken tofu to the base of this kid-approved recipe both enriches it with a little added protein and lends it a satiny texture.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHalloweenPeanut ButterDipRead MorecultureAlmond Joy or Almond Despair?By Alex BeggscultureThe Spookiest Food Horoscopes YetBy Catherine UrbanRecipes you want to make.
