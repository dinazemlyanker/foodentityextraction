During Rent Week? In this heat? Hell no.By Alex DelanyAugust 2, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailSomeone recently told me that chill is a filler word, a meaningless substitute for a more worthwhile descriptor. I understand that line of thought, but I respectfully disagree.Just because chill can mean many things, doesn't mean that it means nothing. My summer is chill. Or at least, I want my summer to be chill. Chill is falling asleep on the roof and waking up without sunburn. Chill is eating a popsicle inside, in front of the air conditioner. Chill is canceling your Saturday night drinks plans to lay on the couch with a beer. Chill is how I want a doctor\u2019s appointment and a dinner party to be. Chill is eating a big bowl of cold, pesto-covered rice noodles when it\u2019s hot enough outside to melt your damn face off.Which brings us to this month\u2019s Rent Week recipe: a big bowl of cold, pesto-covered rice noodles to eat when it\u2019s hot enough outside to melt your damn face off. It\u2019s herb-packed, wickedly simple, and COLD, I repeat, COLD. So smash the play button on this Run Amok playlist I made for you (filled with thrashy, trashy dance tunes and free of charge) and grab some herbs.Now, when I say, some herbs, I\u2019m being intentionally vague. The best thing about pesto is that you can swap tender herbs and greens without a second thought. As long as they\u2019re tender (soft, not woody and stemmy), they\u2019re good to go. Cilantro. Basil. Mint. Chives. Arugula. Carrot tops. Celery leaves. Parsley. Kale. Whatever. For this pesto, I use a combination of about 4 cups of chives, cilantro, and parsley, in whatever ratio you\u2019d like. 1-1-1 gives you balance. You can always tip the scales in favor of the herb you like best.The pesto we\u2019re making isn\u2019t traditional. My Italian ancestors would likely be upset. There are no nuts or cheese, and it\u2019s probably closer to a salsa verde in terms of ingredients. Here\u2019s how we make it:Chop the 4 cups of tender herbs a couple times into more manageable sized pieces, leaving the stems attached. Peel 3 cloves of garlic and chop them in half. Zest and juice 2 limes. Chop 1 jalape\u00f1o or Fresno chile in half, and throw everything in a blender. If you don\u2019t have a blender, fine. You can make this pesto by chopping all of these ingredients as finely as possible. In restaurants, they call that rustic cooking.Very, very chill.\nAdd a few pinches of kosher salt and about \u00bd cup of olive oil into the blender. But this is Rent Week, and olive oil is expensive. So sometimes I\u2019ll do \u00bc cup olive oil and \u00bc cup neutral oil like canola or peanut. It gives you the same fattiness, but with just a bit less flavor. Blend until the pesto takes on a creamy appearance. You shouldn\u2019t be able to see any large pieces of leaves, and the motor should run smoothly, without catching on any chunks of garlic or chile. The pesto should look rich and emulsified.Fill a saucepan with water, add a couple pinches of salt, and bring it to a boil. While you\u2019re waiting on the water, heat a non-stick pan over medium heat and toast \u00bc cup of sesame seeds. Give them a shake every minute or so, and dump them out of the pan when they\u2019ve taken on a deep golden brown color, about 5-6 minutes.When the water comes to a boil, turn off the heat and add 8-10 oz. of flat rice noodles. I like the ones that have the approximate thickness of linguine. Turning off the heat and cooking the noodles on the residual heat of the water ensures that you won\u2019t overcook them.When the noodles are soft with a pleasant chew, dump them into a colander and rinse them with cold water. This lowers the temperature of the noodles and removes any excess rice flour, so they won\u2019t be as sticky. Dump the noodles into a large bowl, pour pesto over them, and mix. Don\u2019t add all of the pesto at once though! Mix it in incrementally, so you don\u2019t over-sauce.Once that\u2019s lookin\u2019 saucy and herby and downright beautiful, use tongs to plate the noodles into a shallow bowl. Top each bowl of noodles with toasted sesame seeds, grab a frigid, frosty beverage, find the most comfortable seat in your immediate vicinity, and...chill.Another chill Rent Week dinner?
