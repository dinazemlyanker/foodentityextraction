And the best meat thermometer for you is going to depend on a few different factors\u2014namely how accurate you want it to be, how you\u2019re going to use it, and how much you\u2019re looking to shell out for one.As a person who effectively lives in the kitchen, and is therefore more than happy to invest in tools that will make said life in the kitchen better, the best meat thermometer is, without a doubt, the Thermoworks Thermapen ONE, a best-in-class product with a price tag to match. When I\u2019m testing a recipe for a pricey cut of steak or serving chicken to hundreds of people at a wedding, I want to know for sure that the tool I\u2019m using to check for doneness is giving me accurate temperature readings as fast as humanly possible. But, for most home cooks, a few seconds or degrees isn\u2019t going to make a world of difference, in which case you can definitely get away with a digital meat thermometer that\u2019s not quite as quick or dead-on, but quite a bit more budget-friendly.Thermoworks Thermapen ONE$105 at ThermoWorksWhat are the benefits of using a meat thermometer?Okay, before we get granular about what separates one type of thermometer from another, let\u2019s talk about what makes this particular tool so important. At the end of the day, a thermometer\u2014specifically one that you\u2019re going to be using to take the temps of different types of meat\u2014is valuable for two reasons: food safety and temperature control.Proteins like chicken and pork need to be cooked to a certain internal temperature (take it away, USDA) in order to prevent the possibility of foodborne illness, so being able to get a quick and accurate reading without cutting into them is crucial. Plus, in the case of meats like these, there\u2019s actually a pretty narrow range between undercooking (read: unsafe to eat) and overcooking (read: dry), and unless you have some kind of culinary ESP (thrilled for you!), you\u2019re probably going to need a thermometer to remove the guesswork and make sure you\u2019re in the meat temperature sweet spot.Then there are the meats that can be cooked to a variety of desired temperatures, like a steak or duck breast. In these cases a good meat thermometer is the only way you can know for sure that the proteins in question are cooked to your ideal level of doneness. There\u2019s nothing worse than shelling out big bucks for a fat rib eye or a bunch of lamb chops only to accidentally overcook or undercook them. Whether you like your meat medium-rare or well-done (no judgie), a meat thermometer will help to ensure that you fish your wish every time.But a meat thermometer has plenty of uses that go beyond, well, meat. I use mine to check the internal temperature of a loaf of just-baked bread to make sure that it\u2019s done, or to find out if my pot of oil is ready for deep frying, or to make sure that a Dutch oven full of soup cooling on the stovetop is ready to be safely stashed in the fridge. A digital instant-read thermometer is the kind of useful, versatile kitchen tool that once you have one, you simply can\u2019t remember how you lived without it.Maybe you\u2019re reading this and thinking, But I already have an analog thermometer kicking around in the back of a drawer somewhere! Do I really need to buy another one?! The answer from us is an emphatic YES. There\u2019s a reason that all of our recommendations are for digital instant-read thermometers. While the notion of a battery-free kitchen thermometer may be intriguing in theory, analog thermometers are simply not fast or precise enough to be helpful in most situations. When so much of successful meat cooking comes down to brief moments and degrees, waiting 10 seconds for a ballpark reading\u2014is the needle hovering over 125 or 130?\u2014just isn\u2019t going to cut it.What is the most accurate meat thermometer?As I mentioned earlier, the most accurate and best instant-read thermometer on the market today is, hands down, the Thermoworks Thermapen ONE. (It\u2019s worth noting here that the Thermoworks Thermapen MK4, formerly the best of the best, has been discontinued and replaced with the Thermapen ONE, which looks and feels almost identical but is even faster.)How do I love this product? Let me count the ways. It is consistently accurate to half of a degree Fahrenheit. It offers a temperature reading in one solitary second, quicker than you can even SAY the word temperature. It has an easy-to-read backlit display that rotates 360 degrees, so you can see the numbers clearly from any angle. It has no buttons to speak of\u2014you simply lever the stainless-steel probe out from the body of the thermometer and the thing turns on, and it turns off automatically after a few seconds when it\u2019s not being used, which saves battery. Speaking of battery life: I\u2019ve had my Thermapen MK4 for more than five years and have never had it die on me, but I love the fact that, if it ever does run out of juice, all I have to do is pop in a regular old AAA, not some weird, obscure kind of battery. Did I mention that it is water-resistant and comes in 10 colors?The only downside to this miraculous piece of kitchen equipment? The price tag. The cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of cooking thermometers is going to run you a cool $105\u2014which ain\u2019t nothing, but as is often the case, quality doesn\u2019t come cheap.Gotcha. But do I really have to spend that much?The great news is: You probably don\u2019t. The fine folks behind the Thermapen also make a smaller, pocket-size thermometer called the Thermoworks Thermopop, which is nearly as good as the Thermapen in almost every way and costs just $35. Why \u201cnearly as good?\u201d Well, it is accurate to about two degrees Fahrenheit compared to the Thermapen\u2019s half a degree, and while it still gives a fast reading, you have to wait three to four seconds rather than one. There is a button. If that doesn\u2019t sound like a big deal\u2014it really isn\u2019t for most cooks and situations\u2014then this is probably the right meat thermometer for you. And just like the Thermapen, the Thermopop comes in a bunch of cool colors, is water-resistant, and has a rotating LCD display with backlight. What\u2019s not to like? As a person who very much loves my Thermapen, I also own a Thermopop that I keep in the glove compartment of my car, just in case I\u2019m cooking a big juicy steak at a friend\u2019s house or a rental without a well-equipped kitchen. Better safe than sorry!Photo by Emma FishmanThermoworks ThermoPop$35 at AmazonWhat is the best meat thermometer for cooking large cuts of meat?While the Thermapen and Thermopop are great for quickly and accurately taking the temperature of most things, there are certain situations when another style of smart meat thermometer comes in handy\u2014namely, when I\u2019m cooking larger cuts of meat for extended periods of time. When I\u2019m, say, smoking a brisket on my kettle grill, or slowly roasting a six-bone rib roast to rosy perfection, I reach for my Thermoworks Smoke, a leave-in-style probe thermometer that allows me to monitor both the ambient temperature of a grill or oven and the internal temperature of a piece of meat remotely. The long probes run from the meat to an easy-to-read display, and that display also connects wirelessly to an (admittedly dorky) remote receiver, allowing you to monitor cooking temperatures up to 300 feet away. Why is this helpful? Well, every time you open a grill lid or a smoker or oven door, you release heat, making it difficult to maintain the consistent temperatures that are key to the low-and-slow cooking process. A gadget like this allows you to monitor from afar and minimize the number of times you have to check on your meat project, which can be hugely helpful. Plus, you can set it to alarm at certain high or low temperature ranges, so you don\u2019t have to worry about falling asleep on the couch and having your smoker temperature drop too low or your leg of lamb overcooking.Thermoworks Smoke Remote BBQ Alarm Thermometer$99 at ThermoworksIf these sound like pretty obscure use-cases, it\u2019s because they are for most people. To be perfectly honest, I\u2019ve probably used my Thermoworks Smoke a grand total of five times over the past couple of years, but every time I\u2019ve been incredibly glad that I had it. After spending more than a week brining my own Christmas ham for the first time, I was able to relax during the hours it spent in my hand-me-down smoker knowing that I could check on it from anywhere in my house. It\u2019s definitely not the kind of meat thermometer that every home cook needs to have, but if backyard BBQ and other big, meaty projects with long cooking times are your thing, it may very well be worth the $99 investment.Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingcookingRecipes you want to make.
