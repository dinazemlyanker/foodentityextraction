You\u2019ll find everything from rich, traditional ramen, udon, and soba noodles to expertly prepared sushi and sashimi from world-renowned chefs. When you board one of Princess Cruises\u2019 ships to sail through Japan\u2019s pristine waters, make sure you add a land tour for an in-depth and delicious adventure.On your next journey there, pay a visit to Tokyo\u2019s sprawling Tsukiji Fish Market. The world\u2019s most extensive variety of fish, bivalves, and crustaceans are on display with species most people have never seen or heard of. Chances are if you can find it in the ocean, it\u2019s probably here. Before you arrive to explore, here are five fish to add to your sushi-lovers\u2019 hit list!Aka Yagara \u2014 CornetfishThis is a fish unlike any we\u2019ve seen before! This long, bright pink-hued fish is caught in Southern Japan\u2019s coastal waters of Miyazaki and Kagoshima and feeds on small fish, crustaceans, and other invertebrates. With a unique body shape\u2014which grows up to 6 feet in length\u2014it has delicate white flesh that is great sashimi-style or salt grilled, and can even be served steamed or in soups.Itoyori \u2014 Threadfin BreamA distinctive fish with sun-yellow stripes, the Threadfin Bream features mild lean white meat and a distinctive flavored skin. Found in the sand and mud of Nagasaki and Fukuoka, it\u2019s caught year-round but is usually at its best in the spring and summer. This versatile white fleshed fish can be prepared in a variety of ways, so keep an eye out for it on menus served as sashimi, traditional nigiri sushi, boiled in soups and hot pots, or even grilled.Ishi-Dai \u2014 Knife JawIf you see this on a sushi menu, be sure to try it\u2014this rare species is not often seen at restaurants. The small black and white striped fish is indigenous to Japanese waters and spends most of its time swimming in shallow waters. Despite its size, it feeds on sea urchin and other shellfish using its strong jaw. It has a clean, sweet flavor and a surprisingly high fat content\u2014perfect for shiromi-style sushi.Kinki \u2014 ThornyheadWith shrimp as its primary meal, this wild-caught bright pink fish has a delicious high fat content\u2014akin to the coveted otoro. Its smooth, buttery flesh is perfect for sashimi but this weird looking thornyhead rockfish (also sometimes known as idiot fish!) is also prepared in other ways. You\u2019ll find it deep-fried whole or simmered gently in broth. This deep-sea fish has become a somewhat rare find at Japanese markets, due to restrictions on overfishing.Tachiuo \u2014 BeltfishWith stunning silver skin, this slender fish can reach up to seven feet long, but most found in fish markets are around three feet. Found year-round in most parts of Japan\u2019s oceans, it\u2019s considered by many local seafood lovers as more of a summertime treat. The flesh has a mild taste and is served in a variety of preparations\u2014raw or as aburi sushi (where it\u2019s partially seared via blowtorch), boiled with soy sauce and fish broth, or even served with sake as an Izakaya snack.Explore Tokyo with Princess Cruises' NEW Temples & Traditions Tour.Learn More About Culinary Destinations at www.princesscruises.com/bonappetitRecipes you want to make.
