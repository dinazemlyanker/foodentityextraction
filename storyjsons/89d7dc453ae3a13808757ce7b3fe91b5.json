Day in, day out, it\u2019s the same thing: Wake up, brush my teeth, exercise (LOL), make my first mug of pour-over and, eventually, get on with the day. Where I once found constancy and stability in these micro-rituals, my routines had become rote. They were officially stale.I knew I needed to shake things up, but switching up my workout from yoga to HIIT exercises felt excessive (and I\u2019m a lazy person who doesn\u2019t like to sweat\u2014no thanks). Changing the coffee in my grinder and my process of brewing it felt like a gentler way to introduce change, however small.Enter Fat Miilk, a new coffee company whose goal is to introduce Vietnamese coffee culture, tradition, and flavor to Americans. Founded by Lan Ho and Tuan Huynh earlier this year and launched in September, the brand leans in on the founders\u2019 upbringing, highlighting Huynh\u2019s family\u2019s coffee farm in Bu\u00f4n Ma Thu\u1ed9t, the capital city of \u0110\u1eafk L\u1eafk Province in the Central Highlands of Vietnam.In a world seemingly full-to-the brim with artisan craft coffees, Fat Miilk stands apart in one major way: They embrace coffee\u2019s robusta variety. Arabica, which is the species grown at higher altitudes in lower quantities and typically described as fruitier and sweeter, is much more common in specialty coffees, but at a higher price. For a while, robusta (which can be grown at lower altitudes and can be nuttier in flavor) was considered \u201cinferior,\u201d but Ho and Huynh want to change that narrative.\u201cWhere my family grows our beans, the majority of those farmers grow robusta,\u201d says Huynh. \u201cIt is authentic to who we are to embrace these beans. We\u2019re not super-versed in coffee culture\u2014we\u2019re new to the coffee game\u2014but one thing that always struck me was that robusta was always treated secondary to arabica, and that narrative hurts farmers like my family,\u201d who hand-harvest and process the beans before they are roasted by C\u00e0ph\u00ea Roasters, a Vietnamese specialty coffee roaster in Philadelphia.\u201cIt was important for us to get the roasted flavors right, too,\u201d says Ho. \u201cWhen we were looking to partner with roasters for our robusta beans, (C\u00e0ph\u00ea Roasters) knew what we were going for because there was this shared experience. They understood what we wanted, because they\u2019re Vietnamese, too.\u201dThat collaboration resulted in the brand\u2019s first offering, the Blue Roast. Available ground or as whole beans, the coffee is all toasty almonds with kind of a grassy aroma on the nose, an eye-opener for sure. Besides having a different flavor profile from arabica, robusta also has the distinction of boasting more caffeine than its counterpart, if you need to be further sold on giving it a try.Further highlighting the Vietnamese coffee experience, the Fat Miilk team also sells phins, the adorable pour-over adjacent brewing vessels found throughout Vietnam. Easy to use, the phin is not too much a departure from my standard pour-over ritual.Like a pour-over, you place the phin on top of your mug. You allow the coffee grounds to bloom a bit with an initial splash of hot water\u2014just enough to dampen the grounds. This releases trapped carbon dioxide, which can taste sour, but also inhibits the extraction of aromatics and oils. (Blooming is recommended no matter how you brew your coffee, to enhance your flavor experience.) After the initial bloom, you fill the phin to the top and cap it off with the filter press\u2014the whole production, which doesn\u2019t take longer than 5 minutes, is like a combination of pour-over and French press methods. (Fat Miilk also provides a useful how-to on its website.) Et voila, you have an, ahem, a robust cup of joe to fuel whatever the day may bring. The whole process is familiar but enough of a difference that reminds me change is fun and good.\u00a0Even better? I can use the phin to make iced Fat Miilk coffee in the afternoon\u2014Ho and Hunyh nearly insist. Vietnamese iced coffee has long been my favorite excuse to enjoy a generous spoonful of sweetened condensed milk in, well, anything, so who am I to say no? Rich, creamy and sweet, it is the perfect foil for robusta\u2019s flavors, which tend toward chocolatey when iced.You better believe I introduced a leisurely coffee ritual to my afternoons.Fat Miilk Blue Phin Filter$10 at Fat MiilkExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendCoffeeShoppingRecipes you want to make.
