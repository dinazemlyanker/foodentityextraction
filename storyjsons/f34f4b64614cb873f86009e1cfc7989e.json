The flat, or first cut, is more common, and larger. But the point yields a richer, more luscious final product. (As Carla Music likes to say, \u201cthe point is the point.\u201d Remember that when you head to the butcher.)Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Pretty much every year, I make my mom\u2019s recipe, which she got from her friend Doris Feinsilber back in the early \u201870s. It leans more, how should I say...Midwest, down-home than what you might consider \u201cJewish.\u201dThe key ingredients to Maxine\u2019s brisket recipe: a 14-ounce bottle of Heinz ketchup, some Worcestershire sauce, a bit of brown sugar, a couple of onions and bunch of dried spices.Which, if you think about it, is not dissimilar to the brisket recipe we ran last year from Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2019 excellent new-school deli, Mamaleh\u2019s (pictured up top). Whereas Maxine\u2019s version relies on ketchup for sweetness, Mamaleh\u2019s turns to Manischewitz concord grape wine.In either a case, the blend of sweet and spicy elements produce a tangy sauce, not unlike what you find with Texas barbecued brisket. It proves the perfect complement to the rich, fall-apart-tender meat.Photo by Adam RapoportWhichever brisket recipe you opt for, just remember a couple of things:Salt it well all over. It\u2019s hefty cut of meat; it can take it.Brown it well all over before you braise it.Better to cook it a bit too long than too short. No one wants tough meat.When the brisket is done cooking (pierce it with a knife; it should give easily), I like to remove the meat from the sauce to let it cool. You can do this a few days ahead, even. I then strain the solids from the sauce, and after the gravy cools in the fridge, I skim the solidified fat cap.Now, the important part: Slice the cooled meat against the grain, and layer it into a baking dish and then pour the sauce all over it. (Pictured above on my mom\u2019s rug, because you gotta do what it takes to get the \u2018gram, right?)Cover and slowly reheat at, like, 300\u00b0. Do this, and each slice will absorb the sweet, silky sauce\u2014and become that much more tender\u2014while doing so.Brisket does the trick for pretty much any big holiday meal. Even when it\u2019s a week late.Get some brisket recipes:Maxine\u2019s Brisket (my mom\u2019s recipe)Mamaleh\u2019s BrisketBraised Brisket with Hot Sauce and Mixed ChilesBraised Brisket with Bourbon-Peach GlazeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBrisketAdam NewsletterRead MorecookingMy Mom\u2019s Brisket Recipe Uses an Entire Bottle of Heinz KetchupBy Adam RapoportRecipes you want to make.
