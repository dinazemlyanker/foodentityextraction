Each of the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen editors will be sharing their top 10 cooking rules: the techniques they swear by, the ingredients they can\u2019t live without, and the mindsets that keep them going. This week: the senior food editor who sprinkles a ton of herbs across all of his dishes, Andy Baraghani.1. Group like tasksThis is all about organization and getting you set up properly in the kitchen. If you are making an apple pie, peel all the apples first, then slice them. Don\u2019t peel and slice each one before moving on to the next. Doing it by task will make you become a faster, more efficient cook.2. When it comes to dairy, go full fat. Period.There\u2019s a reason we always say this to our readers and viewers, but I still feel like a lot of people are buying the 1 percent, 2 percent, or non-fat versions of things like yogurt, milk, and cottage cheese. There is just no replacement for full-fat dairy, as the versions with a lower amount will lack flavor and have a chalky texture.3. Skip boxed or canned stock when making soups, braises, or stewsAt this point, I\u2019ve actually stopped calling for stock in any of my recipes. If you\u2019re not making it yourself (or buying a really, really good version from somewhere you trust, like a butcher shop), it just doesn\u2019t taste good. Water that you\u2019ve doctored up yourself does the trick perfectly.4. Know your oilsExtra virgin olive oil can be robust and peppery, other times fruity and smooth. Nut and seed oils are generally quite forward and usually are best to finish foods with. Neutral oils, like canola, vegetable, sunflower, and peanut have little to no flavor.You better believe those green beans were blanched in heavily salted water.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Kalen Kaminski5. Blanch or boil vegetables in heavily salted waterI do \u00bc cup Diamond Crystal kosher salt to 2 quarts water. You\u2019ll not only bring out the the flavor of the vegetable, but you\u2019ll enhance the color, too.6. Please grate all cheese yourselfYes, pre-shredded cheeses are convenient, but they often lack flavor. Plus, stabilizers are often added to keep the cheese from clumping together. But there is one exception: grated Parm from a good-quality market, since it was probably grated that day!7. Two acids are better than oneVinegar on its own can be abrasive, but combine it with some citrus juice or zest, and they balance each other out. What\u2019s more, you shouldn\u2019t be thinking of acid as only those two things. Yogurt, buttermilk, and tamarind all will add acid to your dressing, your braise\u2014anything! Get those in the mix, too.8. Add hard herbs early; save tender herbs for the endUsing harder herbs (bay leaves, thyme, rosemary, sage) early in the cooking process will infuse the dish with the help of the heat. Softer, tender herbs (parsley, cilantro, basil) should be added toward the very end so that they stay raw and bright. While there are sometimes exceptions, that\u2019s pretty much the rule.This miso pesto ramen is not your classic Italian version, but it\u2019s just as addictive.\nPhoto by Alex Lau9. Have a secret weaponReally what I mean is a signature that you can refine and refine. For example, people can recognize my food because it\u2019s acidic and there are always a lot of herbs. I also like variations of savory toppings and sprinkles, riffs on classic sauces, like miso pesto and tahini ranch. I think of those things as my secret weapons.10. When in doubt, use a white plateI\u2019ll admit, I get very weird about the way I think food should be plated. It\u2019s the last thoughtful thing you do before you sit down and eat, or send the dish out to your guests. Make it look good. That means put it on a round (white) plate with little to no lip.Listen to the full discussion on the BA Foodcast:ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Explore Bon App\u00e9titTest KitchenRead MorecultureIt\u2019s Time to Stop Using Old Spices\u2014and More Essential Cooking Rules From Brad LeoneBy Brad LeonecultureOver-Salt Your Cookies\u2014and More Essential Cooking Rules From Molly BazBy Molly BazcultureChopsticks Are the One Tool You Actually Need Around\u2014and More Essential Cooking Rules From Chris MoroccoBy Chris MoroccoRecipes you want to make.
