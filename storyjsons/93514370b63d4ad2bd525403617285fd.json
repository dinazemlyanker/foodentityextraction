Do you hear that? It\u2019s me, clomping my way around the island of Manhattan in my wooden-heeled, well-worn Dansko clogs. I love them, it\u2019s true, it\u2019s on the record. But when I saw Jelly Belly expert Claire Saffitz wearing a pair of ventilated, Smurf-blue Calzuro clogs recently, I had to have a pair. Unlike my bulbous Danskos, these have a sleeker shape and a short heel that helps \u201creduce fatigue,\u201d but most of all, they\u2019re lightweight and quiet. Order up!Others have written Calzuro appreciations before me. The high-tech co-polymer composition plastic clogs are beloved especially by medical professionals (you can easily clean them in the washing machine\u2014or dishwasher, and bleach to de-germ as needed). There\u2019s something cooler-than-a-Croc about Calzuros\u2014because they\u2019re made in Italy??\u2014but they\u2019re still decidedly oogly. You can get them with ventilation holes if you have sweaty feet, or not, if you plan on spilling soup on them.The, ahem, practical design gets overshadowed by the bright Matisse blue color I got them in; it\u2019s cheerful and inviting. They have a subtle glitter, like my eyeshadow primer and concrete sidewalks. Senior food editor Anna Stockwell has a pair that\u2019s Starbucks-straw green, to which she added some yellow straps (sold separately!). A Calzuro rep told me that people really like to express themselves with different strap colors. That stayed with me for a while.(Fun fact: Some people refer to the straps on the back of clogs as \u201csport mode.\u201d Recently, I saw a TikTok where a guy says, \u201cGotta put these into four-wheel drive,\u201d and then he pulls down the heel strap on his Crocs and walks through some snow. Great news: The straps on the Calzuro give you that option too.)Claire was wearing hers with tiny no-show socks and the whole fit, as they say at Gentlemen\u2019s Quarterly, was strong. It said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about my feet, worry about my food.\u201d Free from distractions, we can strive towards greatness, ya know?Buy them: Metallic Blue Calzuro Upper Ventilation Holes, $104 on Amazon(Don\u2019t forget a comfort insole!)All products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
