I make them because they\u2019re the best.By Sohla El-WayllyFebruary 25, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Emma Fishman, food styling by pearl JonesFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.The instructions on the box of Ghirardelli\u2019s dark chocolate brownie mix couldn\u2019t be simpler: Place water, oil, and egg in a medium bowl and stir until fully mixed. Instead, I like to crack the egg in a separate bowl, whisk it well before adding the oil and water, transfer it to a measuring cup with a spout, then finally stir it into the brownie mix. I use two bowls, a whisk, a spatula, and multiple measuring cups because I can\u2019t help myself. But all the extra steps I add really don\u2019t make a difference because these brownies really can\u2019t get any better.My mom always stocked our pantry with boxes of this brownie mix when I was growing up. Not the reasonable 20-ounce package but the 7-pound pack from Costco. I\u2019d face-plant into them when my best friend and I fought. I\u2019d stress eat them while cramming for AP exams. I still look to them as the definitive brownie. No homemade brown butter, fancy Dutch cocoa, or tahini-swirled deal has ever come close for me. I guess it\u2019s true what they say: You never do get over your first love.Most brownies are either fudgy or chewy, but somehow this brownie hits both ends of the spectrum. I don\u2019t know how they do it, but there's drama in this box. The contrast between the thin crispy-chewy edge and the dense fudgy interior, studded with bittersweet chips, is so much more extreme than in any homemade brownie. I\u2019m a corner person myself and this mix makes the ultimate corner piece. The edges are a little crunchy and a lot chewy while the middle has just the right amount of soft doughy texture and melty chocolate. The top features an ultra-shiny crackly top that adds a little sugary crispness to every bite. I don\u2019t make Ghirardelli\u2019s box mix brownies because they\u2019re easy (which they totally are). I make them because they\u2019re the best.Buy this: Ghirardelli Dark Chocolate Brownie Mix, $3 at TargetAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
