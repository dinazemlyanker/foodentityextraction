While it\u2019s traditional to serve stews like diaag qumbe with a whole banana (get ready for a delicious study in hot-cold, savory-sweet contrasts) and white rice, Hawa likes to put her own spin on the dish\u2014as all of the women in her family do\u2014by switching in fresh spinach.Ingredients8 servings3medium tomatoes, coarsely chopped (about 6 cups)1red bell pepper, seeds and membranes removed, coarsely chopped2jalape\u00f1os, seeds removed if you want less heat, coarsely chopped\u00bdcup extra-virgin olive oil2onions, chopped2large garlic cloves, finely chopped11\" piece fresh ginger, peeled, finely chopped (about 1 Tbsp.)1Tbsp. curry powder1Tbsp. ground cumin1tsp. ground turmeric\u00bctsp. ground cardamomKosher salt1cup plain yogurt1Tbsp. tomato paste1Yukon Gold potato, peeled, cut into \u00be\" cubes1carrot, peeled, cut into \u00bc\"-thick coins2lb. skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1\" pieces114-oz. can coconut milk3Tbsp. ghee (optional)1cup cilantro, coarsely chopped, plus whole leaves for servingSteamed rice and/or spinach (for serving)PreparationStep 1Blend tomatoes, bell pepper, and jalape\u00f1os in a blender or food processor until almost smooth; set aside.Step 2Heat oil in a large pot over medium.

The flavors are nice and complex, so it's not something that becomes bland or something I tire of. I eat it just as is, without the rice or spinach, and unfortunately I can't eat bananas. But regardless, it's great. very similar to some indian food and simple and easy to make. AndrewColorado Springs10/14/2021I don't know what Mark from New Jersey did wrong for him to give such a scathing review... but it is completely unwarranted. I followed this recipe basically to a T... (a little more garlic, spices, and veg) but otherwise the same. And it turned out PHENOMENAL! I am EXTREMELY pleased with this dish and will definitely be making it againChelsea KTwin Cities, MN9/9/2021This is NOT a 5 star dish.    Not even a 4 star.     As I type this review, the stars read 5 even though I entered 2.     Stars are not properly updating.        The end result was acceptable but not something I'd make again.     Several technique issues at play.     Stewing the chicken raw without browning first is a mistake in this dish.       Adding the tomato paste raw without a saute is another mistake.        In the end, something was out of balance.     OK but not great and I'm not sure how to fix it.       MarkNJ7/10/2021This recipe is excellent, and goes great with Hawa's Zanzibari pilau as well. My partner is dairy free so subbing in any kind of dairy free yogurt still creates a great creaminess and cohesion in the dish. Anonymous6/23/2021This was incredible and every picky eater in the family loved it!  Added more carrot and potato from previous reviews and totally agree that the sauce can handle the additions. I also tripled the curry and doubled the cumin because that's how we roll!  Didn't have cardamom so threw in some cinnamon. Did take longer to cook the veggies than in the recipe which wasn't a problem other than people were salivating at the aroma and hovering in the kitchen around the stove.  Fed a family of four and still leftovers.   Definitely in the permanent rotation!  MelissaRochester, NY6/3/2021Delicious! Really enjoyed the BA video of the chef making this dish.PGSanta Fe, NM3/4/2021Absolutely wonderful! Makes a ton of food, totally worth the prep work. I second other reviewers' comments that there's quite a bit of sauce -- I upped the vegetables to 16oz of carrots + 2 potatoes and I still had enough sauce to really soak into the rice. I also added 3 jalepenos instead of 2 and it's still really mild (and I'm definitely not someone who handles heat in food well), so no worries to anyone concerned about that.\n\nI REALLY loved this dish when it made it in the summer because those fresh tomatoes made the sauce phenomenal. Not as mindblowing in winter, although I think just using a 28oz can of whole tomatoes (minus the liquid in the can) is better than paying up for bland out of season tomatoes. Still good either way, though!RJacobs2/28/2021SO GOOD!!! the yogurt gives a creamy ness that is irresistible. i used chicken breast and chicken thighs two separate times. both are great, but the thighs give an extra fattiness. served with homemade flatbread (from claire saffitz\u2019s cookbook) and it was A PERFECT COMBO!!Kiersten Wasserman2/21/2021I've made this several times and it's always delicious. I'd recommend making it as the recipe suggests, but in a pinch I've substituted canned tomatoes for fresh and even mild harissa for red pepper and it's still delicious. I've also been lazy and skipped the blending step which also results in still tasty rustic version of the original recipe. AnonymousNew York, NY1/22/2021This recipe was a complete hit and one that everyone asked to be included in the rotation. I kept the jalape\u00f1o seeds which gave it more spice but I will say I would give the potatoes a little longer because with the times they gave my potatoes were still a little too firm for my liking. Also added more garlic and turned out delicious. Nick C Atlanta, Ga 1/22/2021This is a definite keeper recipe. The spices are well balanced with nothing overpowering the flavor profile. Just enough heat (keep the jalape\u00f1o seeds for more) a real comfort food dish! I followed the recipe to the letter and wouldn\u2019t change anything. I served it over spinach and riced cauliflower with banana on the side. It was wonderful!  DanAlbuquerque 12/24/2020How's this different than a chicken tikka masala? HalNew York, NY 11/23/2020Amazing dish!  I am from India and this has the same flavor profile as many Indian dishes. I didn\u2019t think there was too much chopping at all and I halved the recipe which worked well for my family of 4.  AnonymousColorado Springs, CO11/6/2020Wow, this is one wicked yummy dish.  Not hard. The chopping is not that bad (IMHO) as if I\u2019m doing something off BA or Epi I expect a little work. That said, an hour is too much for a weeknight, but this is an excellent idea to prep on the weekend and have later during the busy work week.  (Thx to the person who suggested sweet potato as I lame brained picking Yukons up at the groc store).  That said, my husband didn\u2019t care for it.  Bummer. Lunch for me!AnonymousReston, VA11/1/2020With the first fall chill in the air I thought, \u201cDang. Summer is over.\u201d My second thought was \u201cBut we can cook Hawa\u2019s awesome dish without sweating to death.\u201d I struggle not to make this every single week from October to April. BA made a grave error in not recognizing and rewarding Hawa\u2019s skills. I preordered \u201cBibi\u2019s Kitchen,\u201d and I have a feeling it\u2019s pages will soon be stained and well-worn in no time. Everyone, go get that cookbook.
