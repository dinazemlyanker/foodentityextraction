I did the recipe as written using Carolina gold rice, and I probably overcooked the red kidney beans, but that was fine. I will NEVER be without epis in my refrigerator again, because it's the consummate hot sauce and it goes well with anything you want to spice up.DaveSherman Oaks, CA2/20/2022This was a lovely dish, came together pretty easily, and was comforting and flavorful. I agree with another reviewer that the dish could use more epis. We ended up stirring the leftover epis straight into our leftovers and it was really delicious that way!LaurenAtlanta, GA1/29/2022Delicious!!!  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out wonderful.  Since there's so much Epis left over, I'll freeze in small portions to use next time I make this dish or add to other dishes.  The rice was perfectly cooked and the flavor was so good.  I served with bratwurst and that was a great combination.ChristySeattle, WA1/20/2022I used white beans instead of kidney beans, a lot of canned chipotle peppers instead of the habeneros, vegetable broth instead of water,, and used ALL of the epis. Came out tasty and satisfying. Ian1/10/2022This was a quick meal and pretty tasty, but I think it could have done with more of the epis. I did sub in 1 can of (borlotti) beans in place of the dry, and though I simmered with the garlic/scallions I'm guessing my broth was probably less flavourful than had I cooked the beans from dry.  Will try again with beans from dry and report back.
