Alkhanshali's journey to start his third-wave coffee company isn't the stereotypical start-up story of working in someone's garage and pitching a bunch of investors. Instead, it involves war zones, too-many-to-count near-death experiences, constant illnesses, a crazy number of coincidences, and outstanding coffee. Frankly, the book reads like unrealistic fiction that goes a step too far out of believability... except that the whole story is true. This isn't a \"food book\" per se\u2014it's great narrative non-fiction in which the pursuit of high quality coffee (really high quality, that is\u2014Blue Bottle sold Port of Mokha's first batch of coffee for $16 per cup) is the reason Alkhanshali repeatedly risks his life.We spoke to Eggers about his decision to tell this story, his own relationship to coffee, and more.At what point did you know that Mokhtar's story was going to be your next book? What convinced you?I knew Mokhtar from years before, and we have a mutual friend in the writer Wajahat Ali. One day Wajahat said, \u201cDid you hear what happened to Mokhtar?\u201d Waj gave me a vague outline of the story, but when I checked in with Mokhtar, the story got infinitely more intriguing and complex. We sat down one day and he unloaded, and we met up for about 12 hours over the next few weeks. He\u2019d just returned from Yemen and I felt it was important to get it all down before his memories started fading. Mokhtar\u2019s story exemplifies a lot of things I gravitate to\u2014entrepreneurship and adventure high among them. And given the opportunity to learn something new\u2014in this case, the history of coffee and the coffee industry today\u2014I get inspired.Photo by Jake StangelWhat was your relationship to coffee before writing The Monk of Mokha and what is your relationship to it now? Have your consumption habits changed?I drank my first cup of coffee at age 35, when my daughter was born and we weren\u2019t sleeping much at home. I needed coffee to have any mental acuity those first few years. But even then, I didn\u2019t think much about its sourcing or the farmers at the beginning of the process. I certainly didn\u2019t know coffee was a fruit picked by hand, or anything about the incredible intensiveness of its processing. Now that I do, it\u2019s made me a far better consumer. That\u2019s the hope for any story about how anything\u2019s made\u2014if you can think about the people involved at every stage of the process, from the farmers to the roasters, you can make better informed decisions that can improve that industry and everyone who works within it.It's pretty easy to balk at the idea of paying $16 per cup of coffee. I'm guessing you've had Mokhtar's coffee\u2014can you describe the taste? What's the difference between an average $3 cup and his?Mokhtar\u2019s coffee really is exquisite. But you have to roast and drink it a certain way that\u2019s very different than the overroasted and overly hot way most people drink their morning fuel. Mokhtar\u2019s coffee is far closer to wine than it is to the charred black beverage that we often drink in the morning. I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s anything wrong with that, but they are very different.You traveled to Yemen when you were doing research for this book. What did you learn about coffee from your time there?We went to Ethiopia and Djibouti, too. And Abu Dhabi and Richgrove and Santa Barbara, the home of the only coffee farm in the continental U.S. In all these places, Mokhtar and I had a blast. He\u2019s about the easiest travel companion you could hope for, and when we visited coffee farms around the world, he\u2019s still very humble and always learning. Every coffee farm is very different, and their challenges unique, and he sits with farmers everywhere and asks questions, always expecting new edification. It was all new to me, so I learned every minute.How many cups of coffee (roughly) did you drink when you were working on drafts for the book?I\u2019m a morning coffee drinker, and can\u2019t drink much later in the day if I want to sleep. I will say that at Boot Coffee [Ed note: Boot Coffee founder Willem Boot plays a key role in Port of Mokha's launch], where we spent a lot of time over the last few years, they\u2019re always urging samples on you. At any given moment, there are 20 cups of freshly brewed elite coffees, and it\u2019s a bit of a crime to say no. I also learned cupping\u2014the slurping and spitting and grading\u2014and that helps. When you don\u2019t have to swallow every sip, it keeps your blood-to-caffeine ratio more tenable.What's your everyday go-to coffee?I only drink Mokhtar\u2019s coffee. I have to say that, I think. I would never think about any other brand.Buy The Monk of Mokha on Amazon for $19.Coffee on the mind...Explore Bon App\u00e9titBooksCoffeeRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
