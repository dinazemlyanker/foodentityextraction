Have a question? Email staff.bonappetit@gmail.com.I don't know what time or day it is anymore. In this state of confusion, when is it appropriate to have a cocktail or a glass of wine? \u2014Timeless TaliaWell, all of Europe seems to be able to have a glass of wine with lunch so I don\u2019t know why the line of demarcation got officially drawn at 5:00 p.m. in the U.S. Have you ever had a crisp glass of Sancerre with a big lunch burrito? Heaven! Take a little nap afterward; set your Slack away message to \u201cBRB\u201d like a certain colleague of mine does when she\u2019s definitely napping. It\u2019s good for the immune system to rest, relax, and feel joy. However you need to do that, do that.We looooOooove cabbage around here.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Susie Theodorou, prop styling by Sophie StrangioHow much cabbage is too much cabbage? \u2014Cruciferous CamilleI can fit two heads into my crisper, so that seems like enough. It does keep FOR WEEKS, which is amazing. But the answer is three heads. Three is too much. Speaking of heads, don\u2019t lose yours hoarding bulk vegetables (or anything, for that matter) you don\u2019t have the physical or stomach space to store.Is it a big deal to eat expired canned soup? It seems wasteful to throw it out. \u2014Dated DoreenThe expiration date on canned food is determined by the company that makes it, but most canned food can last much longer than that date (check out this app the UDSA made for more specific timelines). Today I learned that high-acid canned goods don\u2019t last as long, fascinating! Everything you feel iffy about should get a look and smell test. But let this be a learning moment for you\u2014go through that pantry and see what\u2019s expiring in the next few months and put it on the counter. Eat it!How do I manage my newfound nightly ice cream consumption? I went from a Klondike bar to half a pint of H\u00e4agen-Dazs coffee ice cream. Sometimes I caramelize bananas and pour that over. \u2014Overboard OtisNice touch with the caramelized bananas. That sounds like a smart way to get in a daily dose of fruit/potassium, IMO. Ice cream is crammed with bad-for-you sugar, which makes it hard for me to fall asleep, and you\u2019re going with COFFEE ice cream too, so we might not be on the same page, philosophically. But if you\u2019re cooking all your meals, otherwise eating your greenery, touching your toes twice a day\u2014a little ice cream treat isn\u2019t that big of a deal (me = not a dietician). Especially if the happiness payoff is so huge.Can I snack during Zoom meetings? I\u2019m muted! \u2014Chomping ChesterWhen I see someone snacking in a Zoom meeting all I want to know is \u201cwhatcha eatin?\u201d It\u2019s distracting! And some people are gross eaters, let\u2019s be real. I\u2019m already seeing inside the intimate space of your home, do I also need to see the inside of your mouth? I\u2019m gently advocating for not snacking in professional meeting environments, but then again, I\u2019m a person who feels self-conscious sipping from my Camp Snoopy water glass in video chats. I\u2019d never fathom going full sandwich. But also: I\u2019m not THAT busy. Are you?Preserved lemons got you perplexed?

All of these downright heroic healthcare workers and tireless deliverypeople are out there risking their lives for us, and we\u2019re conniving about hidden Cheez-Its? Is it possible that revealing and sharing the special treat might make your roommates so delighted that your own pleasure will multiply?? There\u2019s a lot heavy thinkers have to say about American individualism in the time of Coronavirus; how our resistance to being told what to do is why the virus spread. But we\u2019re just talking about snacks, aren\u2019t we?
