As Julia Kramer wrote in 2016, Jensen \u201cstructures her life around the rhythms of a wood-burning oven, not the demands of a high-volume production facility.\u201d We will never find Jensen\u2019s bread in a California supermarket\u2014and that\u2019s part of its appeal.It\u2019s no surprise, then, that her new cookbook, A Baker\u2019s Year: Twelve Months of Baking and Living the Simple Life at the Smoke Signals Bakery, is not a straightforward, nuts-and-bolts baking textbook. Part journal, part self-help book, part sketchpad, and, yes, part cookbook, it\u2019s a personal, poetic peek into her life over twelve months, a stand-out publication in an age when, as she argues in her introductory letter, we favor touch screens over face-to-face contact and the appearance of bread to the bread itself. \u201cBe concerned with more than just looks to achieve a bread that doesn\u2019t leave the heart bitter and the stomach empty,\u201d she instructs. \u201cBread should look, first and foremost, like it came from somewhere.\u201dAnd your bread will look like it came from you. Jensen does not\u2014she cannot!\u2014offer instruction that would allow us to replicate the perfectly rustic sourdoughs and festooned pies that have earned her so many Instagram followers. She calls for freshly-milled, regionally-specific grains, for a cornmeal called \u201cBloody Butcher,\u201d for bee pollen, sorghum syrup, edible flowers, and many other ingredients you may not find at your local store. Unless you can recreate Jensen\u2019s exact environment, your pies, cakes, and breads will not be mistaken for hers. And that\u2019s okay.Jensen talks about baking like many people talk about yoga: your practice, your breath, your intention. She asks us to be patient and resilient and independent. We will learn to take baking into our own hands; we will fail, adjust, and note-keep. She does not outline a guide to pie-decorating because she is confident that we can be artists, too. \u201cWith enough practice, your own voice will emerge.\u201dTara Jensen at her bakery Smoke Signals in 2016. She lets her loaves rise in simple, inexpensive wicker baskets lined with cut-up flour sack towels.\nPeter Frank EdwardsThe headnotes are short, and many are more evocative than informational. \u201cSweet and tangy and a little out of the box. Just like my new crush, \u201d she says of her peaches and rhubarb pie. \"Aromatic and toothy like a bouquet of honey and flowers,\u201d she says of her spelt waffles. It might be easiest to decide what you\u2019d like to bake first based on how you\u2019re feeling at the moment.Even if you\u2019re not a baker at heart, you can still learn something. Jensen tells us how to nurture a sourdough starter, sure, but also how to take a deep breath (start by finding a comfortable space) and host a Sunday night pizza party. You might even get inspiration for tonight\u2019s dinner: coriander-sage pancakes brushed with a honey-balsamic glaze and served with pickled onions, capers, and cheese, or pizza with roasted spinach and roasted turnips. Her \u201cyard sauce\u201d\u2014the pet name for a pizza dressing made from olive oil blitzed with an entire head of garlic, lemon, and herbs\u2014sounds like something you\u2019d be wise to make every week to toss into pastas and salads.Jensen encourages readers to look for pie-decorating inspiration in needlepoint, cross-stitching, and weaving images.\nPeter Frank EdwardsIt\u2019s an eclectic mix, but one that reflects Jensen\u2019s desire for her cookbook to be more than that. \u201cShe wants her book to contain stuff about, like, the moon. About astrology and poetry,\u201d wrote Kramer back in 2016. \u201cAnd people said, Okay, that\u2019s great, but do you have any recipes?\u201dPhoto by Tara JensenThis book is Jensen\u2019s victory. A Baker\u2019s Year closes with an outline of the lunar cycle from new moon to waning crescent, followed by instructions for setting a new moon intention, and and a handful of recipes for lofty, single layer \u201cmoon cakes\u201d: Full moon is what we know to be yellow cake; new moon, a deep chocolate; waning moon, a sunny turmeric-orange; and waxing moon, a hearty spice cake with apple, walnuts, and ginger.\u201cBake the full moon cake two or three times before moving on to the other cakes. You may forgo the timer and the notepad once you learn the rhythm, but perhaps you will enjoy it, bringing the ritual of goal-setting and journal writing with you into your baking.\u201d And when the intention is a great cake, the practice isn't so bad.Get the recipe:Full Moon CakeTara Jensen's moon cakes are about using the ritual of baking as a practice of remaining present, reflecting, and setting goals.View RecipeBuy it: A Baker's Year, $17 on AmazonOnce you've made bread, it's time to make butter:Explore Bon App\u00e9titCookbooksBreadPieCakeBakeRead MoreLifestyleThe New Frontier of Dessert Is Local FlourBy Aliza Abarbaneltest-kitchenHow to Make the Best Blueberry Pie and Maybe Also Find LoveBy Rick MartinezcookingA Gluten-Free Bread Recipe That Doesn't Taste Like Giving UpBy Chris MoroccoRecipes you want to make.
