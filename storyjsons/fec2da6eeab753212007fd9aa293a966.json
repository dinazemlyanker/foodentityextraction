It needed to pack a ton of Vitamin C, and it had to be something that you could make really easily, whether you\u2019re sick, on the verge, or just feeling normal and in need of a health boost.There are so many leafy greens and other vegetables that provide Vitamin C, but I didn\u2019t go that route because nobody wants to turn on the stove or cook anything when they\u2019re feeling sick. Instead, I went full-on citrus and packed in some fruits that I love that don\u2019t get enough attention. The main ingredients are mango, kiwis, and various citrus. They all pack a lot of Vitamin C, and they\u2019re all in season right now. Just take your fruit, peel it, and cut it however you want. Irregular pieces are totally great. It doesn\u2019t matter! You\u2019re going to eat it! Just get it into pieces you can chew.You know those intense, $18 juice shots? That\u2019s basically what this dressing is. I use store-bought carrot juice\u2014if you want to make your own, that's great, but you don\u2019t need to\u2014a little bit of turmeric, some lime juice, and a lot of grated ginger. This is a high-energy, cold-busting dressing. The carrot juice adds even more Vitamin C plus Vitamin A, and it also lends a sweetness and creamy velvetiness that I just love. It\u2019s not thick, but it definitely has a richness to it and it coats the fruit, which I like. And it goes well with a drizzle of olive oil.To dress the salad, spoon half the carrot dressing into a shallow bowl and arrange the citrus, mango, and kiwis on top. Add on the remaining dressing, then top with a drizzle of olive oil, sea salt, and red pepper flakes if you crave a little spice. This Vitamin C salad is so juicy, intense, zingy, and gingery\u2014if this doesn\u2019t make you feel better, I don\u2019t know what will.Boost your immune systemVitamin C Superfruit SaladFeeling under the weather?
