It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Last week my esteemed colleague Sarah Jampel gifted me one berry from her market sojourn that morning. It was, as she said, \u201cnot that good,\u201d and she 100 percent gave it to me because she needed me to complete a task (it worked), but the bribe was enough to get my appetite going. Since that starter berry, I\u2019ve been looking forward to the day\u2014coming soon\u2014when the berries from all of the states in my tri-state area are at their peak. And sure, I can stand here at my stand-up desk and tell you all the things you should make when that happy time comes: Bon Appetit\u2019s ultimate strawberry shortcake, this swirly semifreddo, an epic strawberry pie, or maybe you\u2019d be into Amy Schumer\u2019s husband\u2019s recipe for strawberry and basil shortcakes. You could put your strawberries into this ice cream pie, or make an Eton mess, or you might like to try something really off-the-wall like a salad with strawberries in it (I wouldn\u2019t).Carla Makes Strawberry Shortcake\nWant this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!But maybe, just maybe, you\u2019re a purist. Maybe you\u2019re not a baker. Maybe you had big ideas and grand ambitions that fizzled out when you got home and realized you didn\u2019t have butter or flour, or basil or cream or eggs or frankly anything you\u2019d need to make any of those recipes. Not even watercress for the wackadoo salad!Photo by Laura MurrayThe great thing about me is that even then I have a recipe for you! I see you, you non-baker who just spent $40 on strawberries but has nothing in the house. You ate as many raw strawberries as you care to, and you will not let the other ones go to waste. You, my friend, are going to slow-roast those berries on the lowest possible temperature setting, and you\u2019re going to like it. The strawberries will release their juices and concentrate their flavor in the process, becoming the berriest they\u2019ve ever been. When they come out of the oven, you can put them in yogurt, or spoon them onto toast, pancakes, or waffles. They\u2019d be a great seasonal topper for a dish of ice cream, slice of poundcake, or a bowl of store-bought lemon curd. Once cooked, they\u2019ll keep in the fridge a lot longer than fresh ones would, and they\u2019ll take up less space, too.This is one of those rare times and even rarer recipes when being lazy is going to pay off. Make the most of it\u2014especially if that means buying more strawberries than you can eat.Get the recipe:Oven-Dried StrawberriesHere\u2019s your opportunity to use up berries that are slightly past their prime.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterStrawberryRead MoreLifestyleHow to Make a Killer Fruit Salad No Matter the Time of YearBy Carla Lalli MusiccookingGet Lost In the Swirls of This Strawberry-Coconut Ice Cream PieBy Alex BeggscookingEton Mess Is Summer\u2019s Easiest DessertBy Carey PolisshoppingThis Is What Strawberries Are Supposed to Taste LikeBy Brad LeoneRecipes you want to make.
