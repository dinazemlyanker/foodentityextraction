But it turns out, thumbprint cookies are just symbolic, like inflatable snowmen and bourbon on the breath of a mall Santa. To master these iconic holiday cookies I wouldn\u2019t need to burn my flesh in buttery cookie dough. The indentation is made by a teaspoon\u2019s rounded rump.Let me tell you more about these cookies tho. Chris Morocco developed the official Bon App\u00e9tit lineup of holiday cookies this December, a task as important and Herculean as the Thanksgiving turkey. How do you convince people to try something new when they\u2019ve been baking the same cookies for decades? By developing some really special, showstopping cookies that they just can\u2019t resist. My favorite recipe (to eat during testing) was this one for double pecan thumbprint cookies. They\u2019re like pecan pie in cookie form. The dough is a buttery pecan shortbread and the frangipane filling is this sweet and gooey pecan paste. Top it off with a crunchy pecan half and an elf\u2019s sneeze of powdered sugar and call it Christmas, folks!I spent a rainy Sunday morning baking the pecan thumbprints, so know that these are a project. You need the leisure of time (not ALL day), but you can do this over two days if you\u2019ve got things to do and people to see. The recipe is basically two mini recipes, the cookie dough and the frangipane. Both need the food processor, and to chill. Project means it\u2019s got a few moving parts, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s technically difficult. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s mixing stuff. What took me time was setting up two separate mise en place (egg yolk over here, egg white over there)\u2014which I highly recommend to stay organized\u2014and then pausing to wash the food processor in between. You can mix the frangipane a few days ahead if that makes your life easier.The hardest part for cookie amateurs like myself was achieving that picture-perfect shape. You use a tablespoon to measure the cookie dough, but lazy, heaping scoops and lazy, under-filled scoops left me with some that were smaller than others. And then the thumbprint. The recipe suggests the handle of a wooden spoon to make the imprint, but I found the bottom of a metal \u00bd teaspoon to be better, since you\u2019ll then use that same spoon to measure the frangipane. If your imprints are too shallow, you won\u2019t get that satisfying frangipane gooey-center in every bite. See how I\u2019m looking out for you?Because there\u2019s so much butter in this cookie (hey, it\u2019s a cookie), they can keep for a while\u2014up to five days! And the sturdy pecan-flour dough holds up well in say, a festive holiday tin you bought 50 percent off last January. If you\u2019re looking for a make-ahead cookie to win the swap at the office this year, or cookies you can ship to family across the country, or just a cookie that tastes like a mini pecan pie because that sounds insanely good, this is the one.Get the recipe:Double Pecan ThumbprintsThese buttery frangipane-filled pecan buttons are decadent without being fragile, and they make excellent cookies for boxing up and giving as gifts.View RecipeYou know what would make a pretty great holiday gift?
