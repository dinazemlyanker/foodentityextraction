They\u2019re not difficult to make, but here at Bon App\u00e9tit, we don\u2019t have a super basic recipe. We like to make them a little more elevated, like the New-New Bloody Mary and a so-crazy-it\u2019s-good shrimp stock Bloody Mary. But if you\u2019re making big batches for a party at your apartment, you might be tempted to take a shortcut and buy pre-made mix at the store. It\u2019s okay, because we talked to five bartenders to find the best Bloody Mary mixes. Some of them are classics (hello, Mr. & Mrs. T\u2019s) and others are a little more artisanal. They all need a little help to get to the next level for your friends, and lucky for you, bartenders gave a five-ish ingredient list to doctor up Bloody Mary mix\u2014plus either vodka or another spirit to make \u2018em boozy.Check out five semi-homemade Bloody Mary ideas below, starting with a Greek version that includes a large garnish of feta cheese (pictured up top).1. Add a Super Savory Greek Twist\u201cI start with a pitcher full of Mr. & Mrs. T\u2019s classic mix ($6 on Amazon). It\u2019s the best Bloody Mary mix because it\u2019s fairly bland and not too spicy, so you can doctor it up however you like; I let guests either spike with Tito\u2019s vodka or leave virgin. Our neighborhood of Astoria is predominantly Greek, so I was inspired recently to experiment with a Greek twist on a Bloody Mary. To make it, add 1\u20132 Tbsp. of slightly sweet Greek white wine Retsina, 1 tsp. pur\u00e9ed jarred roasted red peppers, and 1\u20132 Tbsp. chicken broth to each glass. The broth adds a nice meaty flavor without weighing the drink down. About \u215b teaspoon of anchovy paste gives it even more umami, 1 tsp. of jarred horseradish is essential for heat, and a squeeze of lemon juice adds brightness. A big cube of feta as garnish is like the funky icing on the cake\u2014I like Arahova or French if you can find it.\u201d \u2014Mike Di Tota, bar director and general manager at The Bonnie in Astoria, NYThis Peruvian take on a Bloody Mary uses Pisco instead of vodka and a spicy pepper paste.\nCourtesy of Yuyo2. Try a Bloody Mary-Pisco Sour Hybrid\u201cI like Red Eye\u2019s original Bloody Mary mix ($16 on Amazon) because it\u2019s not too vinegary and has a nice celery taste. I start with 3 oz. mix and shake together with ice, 1\u00bd oz. Pisco (preferably BarSol Pisco Primero Quebranta), three dashes of aji amarillo pepper paste (thinned with a little water), a dash of Worcestershire, and a dash of wasabi powder. Rim with togarashi and garnish with speared nori, encurtidos (pickled sweet bell peppers), and Botija olives (Peruvian olives).\u201d \u2014Tamy Hoang, bartender at Yuyo in Austin3. Make a Mezcal Michelada\u201cWhenever I think brunch, I think Micheladas. When I can\u2019t get my hands on one I\u2019ll spice up my Bloody Mary \u00e0 la Michelada into a Smoky Maria. I really like using V8 Bloody Mary mix ($4 on Amazon). It\u2019s light and refreshing and a pretty good canvas to play around with. For a Smoky Maria, I typically start with 2 oz. of a good mezcal like Reyes y Cobardes, or another mezcal made with wild grown cupreata agave. Then add a dash of Maggi seasoning (a Mexican hybrid between soy and Worcestershire sauce), two dashes Tapat\u00edo hot sauce, \u00bd oz. lime juice, two dashes Bittermens Xocolatl Mole Bitters, and salt and pepper to taste. Top everything with V8 Bloody Mary Mix and rim your glass lightly with Tajin. As for toppings... I\u2019m still perfecting a way to skewer a taco on top!\u201d \u2014Rui Silva, beverage director of Scratch Restaurants in Los AngelesThis rendition from Nicky\u2019s in Nashville is classic, but a little elevated with extra pickle juice, Old Bay, and pepperoncini brine.\nNicky's Coal Fired4. Pickle It\u201cIf I use mix, it\u2019s Zing Zang ($14 on Amazon). It\u2019s a good base that is already well seasoned\u2014it has a nice spice to it and it\u2019s properly salted, which can be hard to balance. It makes a great jumping off point, and I combine 4 oz. mix with 2 oz. Pickers vodka, 1\u00bd oz. Claussen pickle juice, 1 tsp. Gulden\u2019s mustard, 1 tsp. pepperoncini brine, a squeeze of lemon and lime juice, and salt and pepper. To finish, rim the glass with salt and Old Bay seasoning, and pour over ice.\u201d \u2014Caroline Galzin, general manager and partner at Nicky\u2019s Coal Fired in Nashville, TN5. Turn Up the Heat with Habanero Scotch\u201cI really enjoy Zing Zang Bloody Mary mix ($14 on Amazon). For me to bring the already really solid mix to the next level, I start with the addition of something a bit spicier, so I roast six habaneros in the oven at 400\u00b0 until they have a nice char on them (about 12 minutes). I rub off some of the char\u2014leaving some is fine, you don\u2019t have to go too crazy\u2014and infuse them into a blended Scotch like Famous Grouse. To do so, chop them up and let sit with the Scotch for two hours, and strain. Build the final Bloody Mary with 1\u00bd ounces infused Scotch, \u00be oz. Oloroso Sherry, \u00bc tsp. Hungarian paprika, \u00bc oz. lemon juice, two dashes Worcestershire, and 1 dash fish sauce. Add everything to a tall glass with ice and gently stir. Top with Zing Zang, mix again, and serve with garnishes like pickled pearl onions, Spanish chorizo, and a lemon wedge. The Sherry adds a nice background nuttiness, and the rest allows the salinity and umami to be pumped to 11.\u201d \u2014Josh Relkin head bartender at Proxi in Chicago.6. Make It Taste Kind of Like a Taco\u201cThe best Bloody Mary mix is Gordy\u2019s, a local D.C. brand that you can buy for $12 on their website. I combine 5 oz. mix with 2 oz. of El Silencio mezcal for smokiness, a dash of our Loco hot sauce (or your personal favorite), a sprinkle of Tajin seasoning for a little kick and zest, and a pinch of cumin for warm spice. If I have it around, a splash of juice from Pico de Gallo\u2014yesterday\u2019s party, or from ordering in\u2014helps make it the ultimate hangover cure.\u201d \u2014Vanessa Miller, bartender at El Techo  in Washington, D.C.Here\u2019s a crazy shrimp Bloody Mary:Explore Bon App\u00e9titBloody MaryPitcher DrinksCocktailRead MorecultureThis Shrimp Stock Bloody Mary Is Not Disgusting.
