When I do, I pin back the bangs and twist up a bun, anything to draw less attention to all that. But then compliments start coming in from everyone around me\u2014my boss, my coworkers, that random guy at the farmers market (it\u2019s happened before)\u2014as if I put in real, intentional effort to pull off this new look. If only they knew!Well, consider this recipe the didn\u2019t-wash-your-hair-somehow-looks-amazing equivalent of salsa. Let me explain.Salsa recipes can be complicated, calling for different kinds of chiles, maybe a trip to a specialty store, and requiring some kind of toasting of things ahead of time (spices, nuts\u2014and that can be amazing). All those steps add to up to salsas with depth, smokiness, heat, and a certain je nais sais quoi that watery store-bought salsas never have. But when you\u2019re short on time and on chips and salsa duty for your friend\u2019s upcoming Fourth of July barbecue, it\u2019s easy to backslide into the jarred variety. Don\u2019t, because Miguel Vidal, the pitmaster and chef behind Valentina\u2019s Tex Mex BBQ in Austin, has got your back with this very low-effort, high-return salsa.These chips look lonely\nPhoto by Josh DickinsonThe ingredient list is short and gracious, like the golden days of Vine. (So much quality stuff in so little time!) There are only five ingredients (if you don\u2019t count the requisite salt and olive oil): tomatoes, onion, garlic, serrano chile, cilantro, and lime juice. Since it\u2019s early July, tomatoes might not be quite there yet at the farmers\u2019 market, but Vidal\u2019s recipe makes even mealy supermarket tomatoes shine. Cooking down plum tomatoes (or whatever you can find) concentrates all that sweet, tangy tomato-y flavor, plus it gives you solid time to watch a couple national anthems on YouTube (\u2018tis the season). If Whitney Houston\u2019s 1991 rendition doesn\u2019t have you in tears, you are not a true patriot.Then let your blender do the work, whirring together the slightly cooled tomatoes with all the aromatics (diced onions, torn cilantro leaves and stems, the whole garlic clove, chopped chile nubs). A nice pinch of sea salt goes a long way to finish the salsa, but hold back in case you picked up saltier tortilla chips.And in about 15 minutes flat, you\u2019ve got your go-to-salsa not only for your upcoming barbecue\u2014but the rest of summer. It requires zero planning ahead and really any cooking at all, but it delivers on giving all your chips, tacos, scrambled eggs, whatever you want a little acid, a little heat, a little smoke, and a lot of flavor.Get the recipe:Charred Tomato SalsaNothing beats serving this salsa still warm and freshly blended.View RecipeRelated: Which Tortilla Chip Is Best?
