This is something we Peruvians came up with ourselves.\u201d Gonzales\u2019s version, which they doled out during their pop-up at Ursula in Brooklyn, is made of a sweet potato\u2013based dough that\u2019s fried until crispy and soaked in spiced syrup. The syrup is sweetened with chancaca (also known as piloncillo and panela), which is a type of unrefined whole cane sugar that you can find in most Latinx grocery stores, in the Latinx section of supermarkets, and online.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally and scraping bottom of pan, until reduced by about a third, 40\u201350 minutes. Strain syrup into a medium bowl; let cool.Do ahead: Syrup can be made 1 week ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before using.DoughnutsStep 2Bundle cardamom and aniseed in cheesecloth and tie with kitchen twine. Place sachet in a medium saucepan; pour in 2 cups water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 5 minutes to infuse.Step 3Add sweet potatoes to pan; cook until fork-tender, 17\u201319 minutes. Remove sachet and drain sweet potatoes, reserving \u00bc cup cooking liquid. Let cooking liquid cool slightly.Step 4Meanwhile, pur\u00e9e sweet potatoes in a food processor or blender until smooth. Scrape pur\u00e9e into a large bowl.Step 5Whisk yeast and sugar into reserved cooking liquid, then whisk into pur\u00e9e. Add flour and \u00bc tsp. Diamond Crystal or Morton kosher salt. Mix with a wooden spoon until a sticky dough comes together, about 5 minutes. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled in volume, about 1 hour, or chill overnight.Step 6When ready to fry, fit a medium heavy pot with thermometer; pour in oil to come 2\" up sides. Heat over medium-high until thermometer registers 325\u00b0.Step 7Stir remaining 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt and \u00bc cup water in a small bowl until salt is dissolved. Dip your hands in salt water, then punch down dough. Pinch off a golf-ball-size piece, roll into a ball, and flatten slightly. Push your thumb through the center to create a hole. Carefully slide into oil. Stick chopstick or skewer through hole and spin doughnut around to widen hole slightly and set shape. Fry until deep orange-brown and crisp, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Repeat process with remaining dough, dipping your hands in salt water to prevent sticking and adjusting heat as needed to maintain oil temperature. (Pan should fit 3 or 4 doughnuts at a time.)Step 8Generously spoon syrup over doughnuts to coat.How would you rate Picarones With Fig Chancaca Syrup?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkExplore Bon App\u00e9titDoughnutDessertFigFruitPeruvianSouth AmericanLatin AmericanRecipes you want to make.
