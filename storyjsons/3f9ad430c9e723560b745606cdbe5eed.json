Caught somewhere in the time zone of their sweet 16s, with boyish faces and floppy hair and button-downs they don\u2019t quite fill out, they arrange a constellation of booze across their table of ten. It\u2019s 9:30 on a Thursday night, and things are about to get rowdy.It\u2019s been six years years since I last visited La Viola, a small BYOB Italian restaurant in Center City, Philadelphia. But things look just as I left them. The menu, which has more cursive curlicues than a head of ringlets, serves the same vitello carciofi, pollo rollatini, and green spinach-and-ricotta gnocchi that it did when I was in college. The staff is just as jovial and eager, reciting the daily specials with all the pomp and pride of a royal court\u2019s MC. The clientele is still that quintessentially Center City mix of older well-to-do couples, middle-aged women, and of course, large groups of UPenn students making their first stop on what will be a long night of drinking and dancing ahead. Thank goodness some things never change.La Viola is not a normal place for college kids to pile into, but Philadelphia is not a normal city. The state\u2019s strict laws make liquor licenses difficult to come by, so many restaurants are BYOB. This means that students can drink college-level quality and quantities in the same restaurants that normal people go to for family dinners and special date nights. They can get their pastas Parmesan-ed and salads black-peppered by jacketed waitstaff while taking jugs of Carlo Rossi to the face. They can accompany their penne alla vodka with shots of Svedka chased with Diet Coke, and then spill that Diet Coke all over the white tablecloth. They can shout across the restaurant to their friends at another table. The staff is completely unflappable through it all, which makes it the best place to stick around and get sloppy.I remember it as a taste of adult life without actually having to be an adult, a fancy-feeling, candlelit world where it didn\u2019t just feel okay to be loud and rambunctious but somehow even encouraged. It was where my friends and I could put on our highest heels and our best bandage skirts, cram ourselves together, and eat a responsible base of carbohydrates while getting just the right amount of drunk\u2014not in a frat house, but in a real nice restaurant. It was exhilarating to be able to try on a version of adulthood for one night a week, to pop into \u201creal life\u201d and make a mess of it and not have to clean up the aftermath.And so as the night gets later and the Phi Delta boys get louder and the bladders of wine get emptier and the last remaining couples clear out, I pay my check and head home. The Penn kids\u2019 night might still be young, but I\u2019m not anymore.Brette Warshaw is a writer living in New York City and the author of the weekly newsletter What\u2019s the Difference?Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsItalian AmericanRed SaucePhiladelphiaRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
