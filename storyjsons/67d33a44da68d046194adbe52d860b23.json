I use the word otherworldly here because its powers are mysterious and forceful\u2014the blend itself smells somewhat alarmingly like rotten eggs, but the effect it has on a sandwich, a piece of fruit, a salad dressing, and about a million other things is mesmerizing. It adds a combination of elemental funk, umami-like intensity, and inexplicable depth and complexity. It is the only acceptable type of store-bought Indian spice blend you should have in your kitchen.Alex LauThe origins of chaat masala are somewhat mysterious. A popular (though unproven) story claims it was created in the 17th century by the kitchen staff of the Mogal emperor Shah Jahan, when he was sick and could eat only smaller, lighter fare. The cooks invented chaat\u2014a category of tangy, spicy Indian snacks like a puffed-rice salad called bhel puri or yogurt-coated crackers called papdi chaat\u2014as well as chaat masala to be the accompanying seasoning. These days, though, Indians don\u2019t just use chaat masala for chaat\u2014it\u2019s become a go-to flavoring for practically anything savory or fruity.Growing up, I was ashamed of my love for chaat masala. I never dared pack it in a school lunch out of fear that the pungent smell would stink up my lunch box and make me the subject of endless ridicule. I was embarrassed when my dad put chaat masala in a miniature pill bottle and brought it with us on all of our family trips abroad. (Have you ever witnessed the reaction of a Tokyo ramen master after your father has added chaat masala to his shoyu broth? Spoiler alert: not great.) But in private, I was addicted to the stuff.Here was a spice that you could add to anything with cheese (I like it on grilled cheese sandwiches, in particular) and make an already umami-packed ingredient even more savory and craveable. You could sprinkle it on even the limpest of sandwiches and you\u2019d think you were enjoying something far more sophisticated. You could throw some in a tomato soup that needs waking up, a vinaigrette that needs a touch of interest, or ANY kind of roasted vegetable (though I strongly recommend potatoes). Remember when the internet became collectively angry at a video that suggested putting salt and spices on fruit? This reaction infuriated me as there is no sweet-tart-tangy combination more wonderful than chaat masala on watermelon slices.My mom blew my mind a few months ago when she told me that chaat masala tastes great on almond butter toast. Yes, you read that right. There\u2019s something about the nutty richness of almond butter that tempers the salt and funkiness in chaat masala. You can check my Insta story: I\u2019ve eaten almond butter toast every day for the past several months, bad breath be darned.I am no longer a clandestine chaat masala lover. In fact, I would go so far as to say that chaat masala is the single most used seasoning in my pantry. Nothing else packs such a powerful punch in a single serving or can be used in such a wide variety of foods. And now that my favorite brand is available on Amazon (for only $6.29!!!), I suspect that I\u2019ll be Prime Now-ing chaat masala to essentially everyone when my book comes out.So, on behalf of Indian people everywhere, please, please stop buying prepackaged \u201ccurry\u201d powders.
