I require perfection from my pies. I am not happy unless my cakes come out supremely moist with an excellent crumb. But I could never quite achieve all these things until I traded in my wooden spoon and whisk for an electric hand mixer. The best hand mixer doesn\u2019t just seamlessly transform flour, eggs, sugar, and fat into ultra-luxe cake batters and superlative cookie doughs\u2014it also makes baking a hell of a lot easier. I no longer exhaust my wrist while whipping cream, and now I can actually make meringue!My new Kitchenaid hand mixer has many perks, but what I really love about it is that it\u2019s completely cordless. I received it as a gift last year (note to all with bakers on their holiday shopping lists) and these days, I can\u2019t imagine baking without it. It has seven different speeds for doing all the stirring, mixing, and whipping I\u2019d ever need. And since it has its own built-in battery, I can take it out of the cabinet and use it, sans outlet, anywhere I please. Which, to me, makes it the best hand mixer around.Photo by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Cyd McDowell, Prop Styling by Paige HicksKitchenAid Cordless Hand Mixer$100 $70 at Amazon$100 $70 at Bed Bath & BeyondDo you need a hand mixer?The short answer is no. Not having a hand mixer\u2014or any electric mixer\u2014won\u2019t stop you from baking, but it may put some restrictions on your repertoire. \u201cThere\u2019s so much you can bake without an electric mixer, including cakes, cookies, pies, brownies, even laminated pastry,\u201d says BA senior cooking editor Sarah Jampel. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re vegan or dairy-free (and typically use vegetable oil or coconut oil instead of butter), you\u2019ll get around fairly easily without one.\u201dFor recipes that include whipping egg whites or creaming butter and sugar, though, you\u2019ll want a mixer, since it\u2019ll be difficult to achieve good results by hand. \u201cRecipes where the texture relies heavily on aeration\u2014like sponge cakes or pavlova\u2014are off the table,\u201d Jampel explains. And for things like marshmallows, yeasted breads, and kneaded doughs, you\u2019ll want a stand mixer, a kitchen appliance with a powerful motor that can run for an extended period without burning out.KitchenAid Professional 5-Quart Stand Mixer$430 $220 at Target\u201cI think there\u2019s also something to be said for accessibility\u2014electric mixers may make it possible for people who don\u2019t necessarily have the strength or dexterity to mix or stir for long periods of time to continue baking,\u201d says Jampel.Why is the KitchenAid cordless hand mixer my top pick for the best hand mixer?My experience being a left-handed baker in a kitchen that only has one outlet (that\u2019s located to the right of the counter) is less than ideal. But thanks to my cordless hand mixer, I no longer have to battle with an annoying wire or position my body in uncomfortable angles to use it. The fact that you don\u2019t need an outlet to power it up and that you can use it anywhere in the kitchen (or outside of the kitchen\u2014you do you) is a perk for both lefties and righties alike.Unlike other cordless mixers, this one isn\u2019t big and bulky. I love that the back of the mixer has a flat surface, which means it can stand upright on its own and that I don\u2019t have to find a place to rest batter-covered beaters. I also appreciate its Soft Start feature which brings the beaters up to speed slowly to prevent splattering. The built-in battery lasts for multiple uses and can power through four batches of chocolate chip cookies before needing a recharge. In addition to its functional upgrades, this versatile, 7-speed hand mixer\u2019s sleek matte black design makes it one of the most attractive cordless hand mixers you\u2019ll find. Bonus: The beaters are dishwasher safe.But just because this is the best hand mixer for me doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the best one for every home cook. Having a built-in battery has one drawback: it\u2019s a little heavier than other handheld mixers. So, if you\u2019re in search of a not-cordless option, I\u2019ve got you covered with other options.The best budget hand mixer to get the job doneGet the biggest bang for your buck with the KitchenAid 5-Speed Ultra Power Hand Mixer. \u201cIt performs the basic tasks of a fancy stand mixer for less than \u00bc of the price,\u201d writes former BA editor Alyse Whitney. We also love that it\u2019s compact, lightweight, and easy to handle. While it isn\u2019t cordless, it does feature a simple swivel that lets you lock the cord toward the right or left side to keep it out of your way while mixing. It also has a (quiet!) powerful motor and an eject button for easily releasing the stainless steel beaters when you're done. If you\u2019re a beginner baker or the type of person who only makes cookies a few times a year, this is the best handheld mixer for you.Courtesy of KitchenAidKitchenAid 5-Speed Ultra Power Hand Mixer$60 $40 at Amazon$55 $40 at TargetA high-end mixer that\u2019s smarter than all of usMeet the QUEEN of all hand mixers, the 9-Speed Breville Handy Mix Scraper. It\u2019s fully-equipped with high speed settings, rubber scraper beaters, and Breville\u2019s Beater IQ technology, which detects which attachment is in use\u2014wire beaters, dough hooks, or balloon whisks\u2014and automatically adjusts to the optimal speed. The rubber-coated beaters mean you can smoothly scrape the mixing bowl without any clanging, and the timer means you don\u2019t have to guesstimate how long you\u2019ve been mixing. All of its accessories are dishwasher safe, and it also comes with a plastic snap-on storage case that attaches to the bottom of the mixer so you can stow the swivel cord and gadget attachments away. Consider this the best option for serious bakers who don\u2019t have room for a stand mixer.Breville Handy Mix Hand Mixer$140 $129 at Amazon$210 $140A chic mid century-inspired statement pieceYou\u2019ll want to whip up pineapple upside down cakes and \u00eele flottantes with this retro Smeg 9-Speed Hand Mixer. But even though the design is vintage, the tech is anything but with a 220-watt motor, LED backlit digital display, and comfy non-slip handle. The speed control panel is easy to read and navigate, with just two buttons that switch between nine speeds plus a turbo boost setting. It comes with two beater attachments, two whisk attachments, and two dough hooks, so you can use it for everything from whipping heavy cream to kneading bread dough. Bonus: A cute little fabric storage case is included, and it\u2019s available in a variety of colors including pastel blue, black, red, and cream. Like my cordless KitchenAid, this one can stand on the countertop on its own.Smeg Handmixer$170 at West Elm$170 at Williams SonomaWhip it good:Explore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingequipmentToolsRecipes you want to make.
