The raw preparation, however, means there\u2019s no hiding behind substandard tomatoes\u2014and you\u2019ll want at least two varieties for this recipe, heirlooms for the base and cherry tomatoes for the garnish. If you aren't making the soup the same day you buy your tomatoes, be sure to store them on the counter (rinse them first to prevent fruit flies) to preserve their flavor. Once refrigerated, even the best ones will lose their glory. If you need a break from tomatoes, Cucumber-Tomatillo Gazpacho and Watermelon Gazpacho are just as refreshing on a hot day.Editor\u2019s note: This recipe was originally published on August 8, 2016.Ingredients4  Servings\u00bdEnglish hothouse cucumber, peeled, seeded\u00bdlarge red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded2pounds very ripe red tomatoes, preferably heirloom, cut into \u00bd-inch wedges, 3 tablespoons seeds reserved\u00bdlarge shallot, chopped1garlic clove, finely grated2tablespoons (or more) sherry or red wine vinegarFlaky sea salt3tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzlingQuartered cherry tomatoes, chopped chives, and grilled or toasted country-style bread (for serving)PreparationStep 1Cut 2\" of the cucumber into \u00bc\" pieces and set aside for serving; coarsely chop remaining cucumber and place in a large bowl.

Finished mine with basil, mint and a bit of fetaAnonymousNew York, NY10/3/2021One word - YUMM! I'm sad i made this in Sept instead of earlier in the summer so we could enjoy it all summer long. It will definitely be on regular rotation next summer! Super easy to make and added some boiled shrimp to make it a complete meal. I think it would also be really great topped with some chopped avocado.Natcookie67Denver, CO9/15/2021This gazpacho is delicious, refreshing, and super easy! I stayed close to the measurement of ingredients called for but I'm sure it would be great with a bit of mix and match using what you have in the fridge and the pantry as long as you have great tomatoes and maintain the allium/pepper components.GFYSeattle WA9/4/2021Our Spanish gazpacho it\u2019s made with white vinegar, not with red Jorge Barcelona 9/2/2021Love this recipe! Added some crispy chickpeas and it was so bright and delicious. lisacreatureportland5/11/2020I spiced mine up with a whole serrano pepper and a little crab meat.AnonymousFlower Mound, TX4/29/2020This gazpacho is like tomato-summer water, in a good way. The straining removes all chunks from the soup, so it\u2019s closer to juice than what I think of as soup. Great flavor, especially after a day or so. AnonymousBrooklyn 10/18/2018This was totally delish.AnonymousMaine9/5/2018One question.  What is the benefit of pre marinating the ingredients whole?  I always blend and then let chill in the fridge for a couple of hours.CanarygirlSpain8/12/2018OMG can you have any more ads on your site?!?!
