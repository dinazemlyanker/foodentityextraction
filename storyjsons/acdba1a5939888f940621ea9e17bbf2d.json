He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.\u201cWait, you\u2019re going to Maine, too?\u201dThat was a common refrain in the halls of BA last week, as more than a few of us editors discovered that we had all basically planned the same 4th of July escape.You could attribute this coincidence to the fact that we named Portland our Restaurant City of the Year in 2018\u2014a walkable town, rife with top-notch oyster joints, fragrant bakeries, and the requisite number of Bon App-endorsed breweries and natural wine shops.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Not that any of our editors would own up to this bias. Alex Delany pointed out that he\u2019s been journeying to Sullivan, Maine\u2014and his beloved Finelli Pizzeria \u2014for some 15 years. Julia Kramer and her husband Zach have spent the past 10 summers at his aunt\u2019s in Round Pond, a decidedly quaint WiFi-free zone (don\u2019t look for any food pics on Julia\u2019s Instagram ). Emma Wartzman and her BF hoofed it to their friend\u2019s in Castine, where she said \u201che\u2019s been coming since he was very young.\u201dYes, it's about the fish. But it's also about the hot dogs.\nPhoto by Adam RapoportA swirl at Beal's is the only way to go.\nPhoto by Adam RapoportWhatever. I was happy to admit that I was a Maine noob (as my 11-year-old would call me) and that I wanted to see what all the hype was about. So Marlon, Simone, and I checked as many boxes as possible, while staying with (long-time Mainer) Andrew Knowlton and family in Rockport.We caffeinated (and biscuited) at Hot 10 winner Tandem Bakery upon landing in Portland. We oystered and munched on Fox Family potato chips on the deck at The Shop on a sunny 86-degree afternoon (not what we expected) and then enjoyed a kid-friendly 5 p.m. dinner at 2018 Hot 10 winner Drifter\u2019s Wife (order any seasonal salad on the menu, and don\u2019t miss the supremely crispy brick chicken.)I was almost Instagram jealous of what Delany, Rachel Karten, and Co. were up to in Sullivan, but honestly, I was too busy eating lobster (and crab) rolls at McLoon\u2019s, soft serve at Beal's, monkfish nuggets (imagine if Popeye\u2019s opened a seafood chain) at Rhumb Line, and Sarah Jenkins\u2019 pasta al limone with crab at N\u012bna June.Meet the ultra-chewy chocolate chip cookie from Tandem Bakery.\nPhoto by Adam RapoportA very summer slice from Belleville in Portland.\nPhoto by Rachel KartenAmid all that eating, we did manage to do some cooking on July 4th, firing up split-grilled lobsters and, of course, BA\u2019s Best-Ever Barbecued Ribs.It was almost the perfect family vacation. But as anyone who\u2019s ever been on a family vacation knows, those don\u2019t exist. Just as we were set to jet home from Portland, we got word that our flight was delayed. And delayed again. Cue the thunderstorms. And delayed again. And eventually cancelled. Cue the 8 p.m. rental car and six-hour drive back to NYC.Cue my friend Jason Gay (longtime New Englander) DM\u2019ing me: \u201cWho flies to Maine?\u201dLesson learned. Next summer we drive.Go there: Portland, Maine, Is the 2018 Restaurant City of the YearExplore Bon App\u00e9titMainePortland MaineSummerRead MorerestaurantsForget the Solstice, Only Tandem Bakery\u2019s Loaded Biscuit Tells Me It\u2019s SummerBy Alex DelanycultureWhat Does Your Restaurant Tote Say About You?By Alex DelanycookingThe Secret to the Drifters Wife's Crispy-Skinned Roast Chicken Involves Salt and...
