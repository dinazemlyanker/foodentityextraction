I\u2019ve moved on (ideally to dessert), but my small apartment, it seems, has not.That\u2019s why I find Diptyque\u2019s Gingembre Room Spray to be absolute genius, instantly banishing lingering scents with a couple pumps of the nozzle. And unlike many air fresheners out there, it actually smells fresh\u2014like just-sliced ginger root. It\u2019s uplifting, invigorating, energizing, even. (Everything that nearly 365 consecutive days of working, eating, and virtual socializing at home is not.)Because Diptyque\u2019s formulation lacks cloying notes of vanilla or sugar often used in room sprays, it won\u2019t clash with your last meal. Even a really punchy, lingering eau de cast-iron-seared harissa duck leg gives way. And, because the parfumerie says the formulation is fabric safe, I have no qualms about spritzing it on the couch, throw pillows, or even my winter coat when meals get really fragrant. Plus, the bottle looks so good that I can leave it out on my coffee table without needing to stash it in an overcrowded closet.Yes, I fully acknowledge that at $68 for 150 ml of ginger-scented magic, this spray is a splurge. But I\u2019ve had the same bottle for two years now and it\u2019s still going strong. This stuff is pretty potent. More potent than anything I can whip up in the kitchen.Photo by Emma FishmanDiptyque Gingembre Room Spray$68 at Nordstrom$68 at Diptyque ParisExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendShoppingproductRecipes you want to make.
