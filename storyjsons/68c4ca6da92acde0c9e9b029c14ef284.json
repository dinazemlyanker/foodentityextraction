This has nothing to do with the raw stuff!By Alex BeggsOctober 3, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Heidi's BridgeFacebookTwitterEmail\u201cA feat of science!\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be caught without it!\u201d\u201cDelightfully, consistently flat!\u201dThese are all rave\u2014yes, the flat comment is a good thing\u2014reviews of garlic powder from the Bon App\u00e9tit staff and test kitchen. We freaking love the stuff. Except Andy! (There\u2019s always a contrarian amongst us. We\u2019ll ignore him today.) What is it though? Dehydrated, pulverized garlic. Oh. Okay. Why would you use this instead of perfectly fresh actual garlic? Let me loop you in.RANCH DRESSING. CRISPY CHICKEN CUTLETS. POPCORN. EVERY DRY RUB. TACO SEASONING. BEEFY CHILI. GARLIC KNOTSSSSSS.These Instant Pot ribs use a dry rub with garlic powder and hot mustard powder. Nice.\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kat Boytsova, Prop Styling by Emily EisenYou use garlic powder when raw garlic\u2019s stickiness is an issue, like in the barbecue dry rub situation, and when you don\u2019t want that overpowering raw garlic note. So in ranch dressing\u2019s case, raw garlic can distract from the tangy buttermilk and chives, and then get even stronger the next day. HAHHHH. (That\u2019s the sound of me breathing garlic breath FIRE in your FACE.) You need subtlety in your life. Well, at least sometimes!Garlic powder. So photogenic.\nRaw garlic brings a lot of spiciness and bite, which is lovable in its own right. So when associate editor Christina Chaey described g-powder as \u201cflat,\u201d she just meant that it delivers one flavor without that raw garlic heat and aftershock.There\u2019s garlic powder in the dry rub for this oven-barbecued chicken. It\u2019s awesome.\nPhoto by Caleb Adams\u201cPeople talk sh*t about garlic powder because it\u2019s not as \u2018good\u2019 as the \u2018real\u2019 thing,\u201d Carla Lalli Music, food director and garlic powder fan, told me. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t think about it as a replacement, but rather its own ingredient.\u201d It\u2019s one of her 13 preferred spices in her upcoming cookbook, a plug for which I better get an acknowledgments page mention for.She also like granulated garlic\u2014made with slightly bigger dried pieces\u2014because it clumps less than the fine powder, and Carla apparently hates clumps. Who knew? She added that if you\u2019re looking to add some oomph to your next steak, sprinkle a little garlic powder/granulated garlic on with your salt and pepper and await a taste bud explosion. Maybe not an explosion, okay, but it will add an umami note that captivates and delights.BA\u2019s best fried chicken sandwich is dredged in a flour mixture with guest star garlic powder (along with onion powder, paprkia, cayenne).\nAlex LauSenior food editor Chris Morocco uses a pinch of garlic powder in hummus. \ud83c\udd92Associate editor Christina Chaey grew up with it on Wonder Bread toasted with margarine, a.k.a \u201cwhat I thought garlic bread was.\u201dContributor Sarah Jampel once made her own with a dehydrator and a mortar and pestle. She \u201clikes to use it when you\u2019re distributing across a landscape,\u201d lol. Jampel, the Bob Ross of garlic powder.Something to keep in mind, though. Like all dried spices, garlic powder\u2019s potency fades over time, so if you recently discovered your jar at the back of a cobwebby pantry, pitch it. Buy a fresh bottle. Then cue up the cutlets:Chicken Milanesa with Ranch SauceThis irresistible matchup of crispy and creamy releases more dopamine than a bag of Cheetos.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titGarlicSpiceRecipes you want to make.
