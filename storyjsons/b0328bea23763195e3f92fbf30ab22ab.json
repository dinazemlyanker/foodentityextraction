But it wasn\u2019t until we increased our family\u2019s size that I realized how critical these miracle dishes would become. The instances when my husband and I were too busy or exhausted to cook grew exponentially, and the idea of leisurely simmering a pot of Bolognese while sipping wine on a weeknight became downright laughable.Cacio e pepe, the three-ingredient Roman dish that could be described as a funky grown-up mac and cheese, should be a slam dunk in the realm of pantry recipes. But upon returning home from a vacation to Rome a few years ago, figuring out how to re-create it was harder than I expected. Whisking hot pasta cooking water into a mixture of grated cheese and black pepper is supposed to form a smooth, glossy sauce\u2014but the cheese always seems to clump up and stick to everything but the noodles. After dozens of unsuccessful attempts, I found a resolution in a virtually foolproof technique from the chef at the restaurant Flavio al Velavevodetto in Rome. Making a paste of cheese and cold water ensures a silky mixture that evenly coats the just-cooked spaghetti every time.Persuading kids who would rather eat buttered noodles or straight-up macaroni and cheese to try a sharp and peppery pasta was another hurdle. Reducing the black pepper helped, but it was a spur-of-the-moment ingredient that inducted them into the cacio e pepe fan club last summer. Since corn is one of their favorite vegetables, I added quickly blanched kernels to the pasta itself, and this combination hit the dinner jackpot. The sweet corn mellowed out the strong flavors of the sauce just enough that the kids were obsessed with it. And because it has so few ingredients, this adult can\u2019t stop gushing about it either.Get the recipe:Corn Cacio e PepeIn search of an alternative to the mac and cheese her kids insist on, Deb Perelman found inspiration in an iconic Italian dish.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titKid-FriendlyWeeknightCornPastaPicky Eaters\u2019 ClubRead MorecookingMake This Strawberry-Granola Crisp for Mother\u2019s DayBy Deb PerelmancookingA Cheesy, Bready Dinner to Please the Pickiest Eaters in Your HouseholdBy Deb PerelmancookingThis Garlic Bread Is the Secret to Converting Bean HatersBy Deb PerelmancookingNo Picky Eater Wants to Eat Broccoli\u2014Until You Add KetchupBy Deb PerelmanRecipes you want to make.
