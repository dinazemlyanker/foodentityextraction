Sign up for our newsletter!The first step is the key step: taking a block of firm tofu, wrapping it in paper towel, and pressing as much liquid from it as possible. This will allow the tofu, after you slice it into domino-like slabs, to fry up nice and crispy. A generous amount of neutral oil, such as grapeseed, is also essential. You don\u2019t want the tofu scorching on a bare pan.Once your tofu achieves a golden-brown doneness on each side, you drain the oil from the pan and replace it with a soy/maple/ginger mixture. The tofu absorbs the salty-sweet vibes of the soy and maple syrup, while the thinly sliced ginger takes on a caramel-y crunch.Get yourself a pot of jasmine rice and a jar of kimchi and you\u2019ve got dinner. Not to mention a new go-to technique in your weeknight cooking arsenal.Get the recipe:Crispy Tofu With Maple-Soy GlazeWhenever you\u2019re cooking tofu, here\u2019s one of our no-fail techniques: Draining the tofu, then squeezing out as much water as possible (without smashing it), is the key to the crispiest cubes.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterTofuRecipes you want to make.
