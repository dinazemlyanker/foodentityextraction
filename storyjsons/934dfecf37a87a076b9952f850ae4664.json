Which is fine because I just saved the rest. Jake6/18/2021This was delicious! Used string beans and had as a side with grilled meats/veggies. Make sure the butter is very soft and the miso has been out of the fridge for some time so the two combine without lumpsAnonymous8/31/2019Delicious!  That's going to be a repeat around here.  The miso sauce is fantastic.AnonymousDC8/7/2019Delicious and super easy! Great summer meal. AnonymousNew York8/3/2019This recipe was everything I was looking for, and more! If anything, just do yourself a favor and make the miso butter -- I'm going to put this stuff on everything from now on. Next time, I'll add a touch more of the chile!bmacna128/6/2018Explore Bon App\u00e9titAmericanJapaneseEast AsianAsianGreen BeanVegetableMisoCondiments, Sauces & PastesSerrano ChileChileGingerHerbs & SpicesSummerQuickEasySideVegetarianHealthyishSearDinnerRecipes you want to make.
