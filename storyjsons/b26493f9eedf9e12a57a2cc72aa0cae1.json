But after the past two years of heaviness and staring at the sparse white walls of my apartment, Current Bettina is ready to go all in on kitschy fun. I want to fill my home with maximalist food-related ephemera and wear glittery platform Crocs and embrace tie-dye and big loud prints and as much color as possible. I\u2019m not alone, at least on the tie-dye front\u2014apparently, in times of turmoil, consumers look to nostalgic fashion as a kind of escapism. And boy, have we seen some turmoil!So when I saw Hedley & Bennett\u2019s Grateful Dead apron collection in all its tie-dyed glory, dear reader, I was smitten. Mind you, I hadn\u2019t consciously listened to a single Grateful Dead song until, um, late last year, but I maintain that you don\u2019t have to be a Deadhead to appreciate the endearingly corny throwback print. It\u2019s not just tie-dye(!) but tie-dye with dancing Grateful Dead bears(!) across it. Some of the bears are even wearing their own little Hedley & Bennett aprons (like the Droste effect) and holding knives, spoons, tongs, and pans. How could I not be obsessed?! (The other apron in the collab is denim with tie-dye pockets for the Deadhead who doesn\u2019t want to scream it to the world.)As many of my shirts, Jackson Pollocked with red sauce and oil, will attest, I\u2019ve never been much of an apron person at home. The ones I\u2019ve tried in the past weren\u2019t right. While cross-back aprons are beloved by many, I prefer the size flexibility of ones with waist ties. Even among those, the neck loops were too long, the waist ties were too short (I like when I can cross them behind my back and then tie them at my front), the bibs were too narrow at the top to provide adequate cover, or the material was simply unpleasant to wear. That rough canvas feeling? Not for me!But the cotton-poly blend fabric of this Hedley & Bennett apron feels heavyweight but soft with a touch of stretch. There are pockets for kitchen towels and Sharpies and meat thermometers and that one lip balm I don\u2019t want to lose. The print obscures speckles of food. The ties are long and sturdy, and the neck loop is adjustable. The shape is wonderfully full in its coverage, though I usually fold it over itself at the waist since the apron goes past my knees (I\u2019m 5'0\"). It just feels high quality, like a really nice piece of clothing.The elephant in the room is the price. The Grateful Dead apron will set you back $105, which is on the higher end of not just aprons but also of Hedley & Bennett\u2019s entire line. (Their essential apron is generally around $85 in solid colors, though collaborations and limited-edition prints and fabrics run higher.) If you\u2019re looking for functionality and cost-effectiveness, you can certainly find cheaper aprons that do the job. You don\u2019t need this apron! But it is a pleasant treat for you or that one cook you know who already has everything.In a spiritual sense, I just want to be the grooviest dad at the cookout. I\u2019m over being uptight and boring. With my Crocs and my silly little apron, I\u2019m ready to keep on \u201cTruckin\u2019.\u201d (That\u2019s a Grateful Dead reference. I\u2019m pretty sure.)Photograph by Emma FishmanGrateful Dead Tie Dye Bears Apron From Hedley & Bennett$105 at Hedley & BennettExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingHighly RecommendCultureRecipes you want to make.
