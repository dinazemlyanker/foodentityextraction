Buckwheat groats are incomparably nutty and crunchy\u2014but if you can\u2019t find them, simply sub in more old-fashioned oats.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Store airtight at room temperature.How would you rate Chai-Spiced Granola?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (5)Back to TopTriangleThis is a delicious and slightly unusual granola due to the buckwheat and black tea leaves. I love how mildly sweet it is. As with most homemade granolas that don't have a high proportion of sugar and oil, this is crumbly stuff. Not forming large clumps. Which is fine by me because it is great in yogurt. I'll be making this again and again. AnonymousOmaha, Ne3/25/2022I've made this granola twice and it's DELICIOUS. Probably my new favorite go-to granola. But I do have to mention one important detail for those trying the recipe for the first time. Make sure you purchase regular, UNTOASTED, raw buckwheat groats. My local health food store had both in the bulk section the first time I was purchasing ingredients and I was a little unsure which to choose, so I went with the lighter, blond colored raw groats. They were great and provided a pleasant crunch. In fact, I feel like that's the ingredient that actually gives this granola some real interest compared to other spiced granola recipes. The second time I went to purchase ingredients, they were out of the raw groats and only had dark colored toasted groats (also called kasha) so I used those thinking that they would taste a little different being roasted, but that that toasty-ness would still play well with the other flavors. They actually have a vastly different texture! They are very firm and I'm a little worried that I might crack a tooth chewing on them. I'll still eat this batch I made with the toasted groats, but I'll likely need to let it sit in milk or yogurt to soften a little first. No big deal, but LESSON LEARNED. FYI, I discovered that Bob's Red Mill packages raw buckwheat groats and I'll look for those next time the bulk section is out. CaleAustin, TX2/27/2022Super good! I loved the way my house smelled with all the spices! I did realize I made a mistake after looking at the picture again. I used regular pumpkin seeds instead of pepitas. Will definitely make again \ud83d\ude0aJulesNewport Beach CA1/30/2022This was delicious and super easy to make. I served mine with vanilla yogurt and banana. Highly recommend! Ashley K. Houston, TX1/17/2022So delicious and crispy. Love the applesauce idea to bind and sweeten. Will definitely make this all the time.
