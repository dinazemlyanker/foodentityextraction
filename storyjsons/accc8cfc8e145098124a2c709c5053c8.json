Serve with Miso Pork Ribs With Chile-Honey Glaze and Sake-Braised Mustard Greens With Sesame, all from Wolf\u2019s Tailor in Denver, No. 10 on our 2019 Hot Ten list.Ingredients8 servings Dashi9dried shiitake mushrooms1sheet dried kombu8cups (very loosely packed) bonito flakesPorridge2Tbsp. sunflower oil4garlic cloves, thinly sliced2cups short-grain white riceKosher saltChopped kimchi, sliced scallions, red-skin Spanish peanuts, and crispy fried shallots (for serving; optional)PreparationDashiStep 1Combine shiitake and 8 cups cold water in a large saucepan. Cover and let soak at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours to rehydrate the mushrooms.Step 2Add kombu and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat to low and cook at a very low simmer 10 minutes. Add bonito, stir lightly, and remove from heat. Let sit until bonito sinks to the bottom of the pan, about 5 minutes. Strain and discard solids.Step 3Do Ahead: Dashi can be made 5 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill.PorridgeStep 4Cook oil and garlic in a large, heavy pot over medium heat until garlic is light golden around the edges, about 2 minutes. Immediately add rice and stir until coated with oil and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add 3 cups dashi, increase heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil, stirring often. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook, adding 1 cup water at a time as liquid is absorbed so that rice is always covered by at least 1\u201d liquid (about 12 cups total) and stirring constantly to keep rice from sticking to the bottom of pot, until rice is tender and mixture is the consistency of loose oatmeal (rice will begin to break down and become creamy after about 30 minutes). Taste and season porridge with salt and any reserved dashi if it is too bland. Porridge will thicken as it sits\u2014add more water or dashi to thin if needed.Step 5Divide porridge among bowls and top with kimchi, scallions, peanuts, and shallots if desired.How would you rate Rice Porridge With Dashi?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkExplore Bon App\u00e9titPorridgeJapaneseEast AsianAsianRiceRice & GrainsSideDairy-FreeGluten-FreeHealthyishSimmerBreakfastRecipes you want to make.
