Yes, you can.By Adam RapoportJuly 2, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailEvery Monday night, Bon App\u00e9tit editor in chief Adam Rapoport gives us a peek inside his brain by taking over our newsletter. He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.If you\u2019re wondering what I\u2019ll be drinking this July 4th, the answer is anything with the word spritz in it.Now, what that means, exactly, depends on who you ask. Everyone at BA seems to have an opinion.Fancy-pants cocktail boys like Andrew Knowlton and Alex Delany will lecture you about how a \u201ctrue\u201d spritz is a combo of Prosecco and an aperitivo (such as Aperol or Campari), on ice, topped with club soda and garnished with anything from a lemon or orange twist to green olives.Molly Baz kind of concurs, riding hard year-round for her Fall Spritz, which subs dry, Spanish-style cider for the Prosecco.Alex Beggs, always one to stir the pot (or at least a drink) lobbies for the intriguing mix of Cynar, grapefruit soda, and Prosecco.Want this letter before it hits the website?

All. Summer. Long.Laura MurrayThe much maligned, then defended, Aperol spritz? Yes and no. I don\u2019t need the standard day-glo orange concoction, which is basically an adult Shirley Temple. These days, if I\u2019m at a nice restaurant\u2014or an outdoor wedding in August\u2014I\u2019ll ask for prosecco on ice with just a smidge of Aperol, enough to give the bubbly wine a blush. It\u2019s a pesky order, which might elicit an eye roll from your bartender, but give it a shot.But mostly, because it\u2019s summer and I\u2019m lazy (as one should be this time of year), my go-to drink is a ros\u00e9 spritz. And I don\u2019t mean some highfalutin version that you\u2019ll find in Bon App\u00e9tit. I mean ros\u00e9 on ice with a splash of crisp club soda, preferably from one of those little glass bottles. Less sweet than a glass of ros\u00e9, colder than a glass of ros\u00e9 (key, if you\u2019re in the sun) and not at all stiff. In other words, ideal for day drinking.And if said spritz is in a Solo cup and I\u2019m in a pool or on a boat, well, even better.Get the recipe:Aperol SpritzThis classic combo should be credited with starting the whole spritz phenomenon in the United States.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterSpritzAperolRead MoreLifestyleI'm Now A Person Who Drinks Lightly Brewed Sparkling TeaBy Alex Delanycooking3 Campari Cocktails You Don't Need a Gazillion Ingredients to MakeBy Al CullitoncookingIf You Can Open a Cheap Beer, You Can Make This CocktailBy Alison RomancultureBring Your Host This Wine and Win At Being a Dinner Party GuestBy Emily SchultzRecipes you want to make.
