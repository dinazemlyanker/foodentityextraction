Cookbook Shop Every Food Lover Needs in Their LifeAt Now Serving, satisfy all your chef zine and Japanese dyed cloth needs. Which are many.By Elyse InamineOctober 4, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailAdam AmengualFacebookTwitterEmailThe new joint that every out-of-town chef hits up when they\u2019re in Los Angeles? Now Serving, a well-curated cookbook and ceramics shop run by former Cut chef Ken Concepcion and his wife and make-up artist Michelle Mungcal. In a little over a year, the couple has made their homey boutique a destination.\u201cMy friend said this is like Other Music but for food,\u201d Concepcion says. \u201cWe were going for an \u201980s/\u201990s record shop vibe, where you can have a conversation with your guests. It\u2019s not just \u2018here\u2019s a book.\u2019 We want it to be an extension of hospitality, where chefs, cooks, and home cooks can feel at home.\u201dWhether it\u2019s stop no. 5 on a nationwide cookbook tour or a refuge for hard-to-find, out-of-print vintage cookbooks and indie food magazines, it\u2019s drawn a crowd of food lovers with an emphasis on books people will actually cook from. As you peruse the shelves of chef zines and tables stocked with otherworldly ceramics and Japanese dyed cloths, you\u2019ll run into chefs like Roy Choi, also in search of the next cool thing in food. Here, Concepcion and Mungcal explain how they channel their love of books into a business.The whole Now Serving fam: Frankie, Concepcion, and Mungcal\nPhoto by Graham WalzerSo, how\u2019d you get into cookbooks?Ken Concepcion: After college, I got an entry-level job at the Library Ltd. in St. Louis, MO, the second largest independent bookstore at that time. I used my employee discount to buy cookbooks by Charlie Trotter, Jacques P\u00e9pin, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, and Nancy Silverton. This was in the \u201990s, pre-Internet, so it was the only way to learn about these chefs. I was a painting and English major, so I would read cover to cover, then go back and look at the recipes. That\u2019s when I fell in love with cooking and started working at restaurants.What made you decide to open a cookbook shop?Michelle Mungcal: Honestly, it was because we were at a crossroads two years ago. Ken was just promoted to chef de cuisine at Cut, but we wanted to start a family. I knew if I made him leave the restaurant world, he\u2019d be miserable. So, we starting thinking about a cookbook store since Ken has such a significant collection.KC: Also, Cook\u2019s Library closed in 2009. I realized L.A. really needed a place where the cooking community could not only pick up a book or find a nice ceramic bowl but share ideas. Whenever I traveled to New York City, I would always go to Kitchen Arts & Letters. Same with San Francisco and Omnivore Books on Food. Once I got back home, it was so frustrating for me as both a cook and book lover that L.A. didn\u2019t have its own place. It wasn\u2019t just me. Before we opened, chefs would have to do their cookbook launch at big-box stores, like I remember when Daniel Humm did a cookbook signing in a mall. It felt weird.What\u2019s the story behind the name, Now Serving?MM: My sister and I brainstormed for months. We\u2019d always pretend to answer the phone, thinking, What will we get tired of saying over and over again? Now Serving seemed to work.KC: We also wanted something with a little bit of intrigue and mystery. We didn\u2019t want \u201cKen and Michelle\u2019s Books.\u201d Now Serving holds this idea of immediacy and hospitality.What did you know you had to stock once you opened?MM: Vintage cookbooks, since that was part of Ken\u2019s education\u2014copies of La Technique, David Thompson\u2019s Thai Street Food, books by Diana Kennedy. Food zines that other chefs tell us about, like Compound Butter. And ceramics (I have an addiction to Minh Singer\u2019s Iceland dishes.) At any given time, we have 1,500 books in the shop, plus JB Prince tweezers and MudSlide Stoneware fermentation crocks.KC: We ask ourselves: \u201cDo other cooks have this?\u201d \u201cWould this be in a restaurant\u2019s office or on a chef\u2019s cookbook shelf?\u201d We\u2019re not going to have appliance-driven or diet-driven books or something that someone can just order online. We encourage a sense of discovery with the shop. We want it to make sense. We\u2019re not selling garlic presses.MM: I love my garlic press!Of all the fall cookbook titles, which ones are you most excited about this season?KC: So many. Michael Solomonov and Steven Cook\u2019s Israeli Soul. Matty Matheson: A Cookbook\u2014he\u2019s a cook\u2019s cook. A Very Serious Cookbook by Jeremiah Stone, Fabian von Hauske, and Alison Roman and Estela by Ignacio Mattos and Gabe Ulla both look very cool. Jonathon Sawyer is all about vinegar, so I\u2019m excited about his cookbook House of Vinegar. There\u2019s also Mastering Pizza by Marc Vetri and David Joachim, the new Joe Beef cookbook, the new Dead Rabbit book, Let\u2019s Eat France, Bong Appetit, All About Cake by Christina Tosi, and I Am a Filipino by Nicole Ponseca and Miguel Trinidad. I\u2019m also really interested in the Bestia cookbook because the restaurant is such an institution here in L.A. and it will be a real showcase of what chefs Ori Menashe and Genevieve Gergis do. Probably one of the big ones is going to be The Noma Guide to Fermentation since Ren\u00e9 Redzepi hasn\u2019t put out a book out in four or five years. As a chef, it blows me away that home cooks are obsessed with it too.What\u2019s next for you guys?KC: That\u2019s the million dollar question. We\u2019re planning to open a luncheonette next door to Now Serving. We\u2019re thinking a classic American luncheonette with tuna melts but also more vegetable forward dishes. After working with Wolfgang Puck for 12 years, I\u2019m obsessed with the farmers\u2019 market and I want to showcase their great work.Read MorecultureThe New Persian Cookbook That Recovers Memories from IranBy Mayukh SencultureChrissy Teigen on the Long Road to Making Her Second CookbookBy Alyse WhitneycultureTarla Dalal's Cookbooks Taught My Mother\u2014And Millions of Indians\u2014How to Cook EverythingBy Priya KrishnaRecipes you want to make.
