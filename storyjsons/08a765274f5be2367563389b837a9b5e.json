An empty dishwasher, according to Bon App\u00e9tit Executive Chef Mary Nolan.By MIELESeptember 4, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailBon App\u00e9tit\u2019s Executive Chef Mary Nolan knows a thing (or three) about home entertaining for any occasion, but fall ushers in a particularly special time for hosting guests around a menu that\u2019s ripe for the celebratory season. Rather than stressing over what and when to prep, so that you\u2019re mingling as often as you\u2019re mincing, we\u2019ve tapped Nolan to give her best time-saving tips for entertaining with ease during the holidays and beyond.Start with an empty dishwasher. This, Nolan insists, is a must, as it will only benefit quick cleanups as you go. A Miele dishwasher is as stylish as it is durable and efficient, and your guests will hardly notice how hard it\u2019s working behind the scenes (seriously, it\u2019s quiet). They will undoubtedly compliment its streamlined, luxurious design, however. Especially for a cook, the Miele dishwasher\u2019s 3D+ cutlery tray is a brilliant feature for safely storing knives to clean, and the Knock2open feature offers touchless access when your fingers are covered in a day\u2019s work.\u201cI always have a bowl of nuts and crudit\u00e9s for guests to munch on.\u201d Nolan\u2019s go-to snacks are perfect for curbing hunger while she and her crew wait on the main dishes of the night. The Miele warming drawer effortlessly keeps those courses toasty while apps are being passed and praised, plus the 4-hour timer feature with automatic shutoff gives Nolan complete control when her attention is elsewhere.Take advantage of the earthy flavors of the season. Nolan loves fall menu planning for the seasonal flavors of woodsy mushrooms, pungent Brussels sprouts, and bright apples and squash. Throw in some fall-appropriate rosemary, thyme, and sage, and your guests will be salivating before the food even hits their mouths.Save that souffl\u00e9 you\u2019ve never made for another night. \u201cDon\u2019t try something for the first time when entertaining!,\u201d Nolan insists. \u201cIf you can\u2019t help yourself, have a plan B ready to go.\u201d Stick to those tried-and-true recipes that you already know your guests will love that you can easily execute with little stress.\u201cSetting the timer on my oven is key when entertaining!\u201d Just as a meat thermometer lets you know when the roast is superb, an oven timer is a no-brainer when it comes to perfecting temperatures, hues, and crusty textures. Nolan loves Miele\u2019s MasterChef automatic programs that allow for perfectly cooked, brilliantly timed, restaurant-quality meals\u2013all at the click of a button. \u201cEspecially when entertaining, never count on a mental timer\u2013you will get distracted!\u201d Miele\u2019s wireless roast probe is all the supervision one needs to cook meat, and even fish, to perfection, by measuring the core temperature with Miele\u2019s countdown indicator for the most precise cook times. Even for a seasoned chef, the smartest appliances offer a fool-proof strategy for an exquisite meal.Now that the meal is complete, that empty dishwasher will definitely come in handy. Chef Nolan suggests running a load after the first course is finished, even if the dishwasher isn\u2019t full. This step cuts down on the larger cleanup after your guests have left for the night, and waking up to a tidy kitchen in the morning is almost as enjoyable as dessert was the night before. It\u2019s even better when that dishwasher has an AutoOpen drying feature in place. Because there\u2019s no time for spots when you\u2019ve got your next party to plan.No matter what timing snafus you encounter during your next entertaining event, go with the flow of it, and enjoy the good company. Take it from Nolan as she insists, \u201cIf you\u2019re relaxed and having a great time, your guests will follow suit!\u201d We collectively say \u201ccheers\u201d to that.Recipes you want to make.
