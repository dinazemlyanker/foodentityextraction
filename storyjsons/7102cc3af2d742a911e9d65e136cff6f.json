D\u00e9viant designed theirs like a tightly run ship.By Christine MuhlkeJune 4, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneFacebookTwitterEmailWhen the grate is rolled up at D\u00e9viant, the restaurant is ready. It has to be: There are no windows or walls enclosing it. There aren\u2019t any tables or chairs, either, just a small open kitchen surrounded by a bar and a shallow ledge on either wall. With its terrazzo, mirrors, marble, and lightsaber sconces, it looks like the coolest hot dog stand on earth\u2014if hot dog stands served p\u00e9t-nat and bone marrow with hazelnuts.The second restaurant of 24-year-old Vivant chef Pierre Touitou (BA featured him when he was still in culinary school!) and his partner, Arnaud Lacombe, D\u00e9viant is right up the block. For Touitou, the concept for the plein air space in the 10th arrondissemen comes from France\u2019s traditional butchers, fishmongers, and charcutiers: \u201cIf the owner is standing outside, you know it\u2019s open. When the door is open, it\u2019s open.\u201dThey selected a black-based terrazzo for the floors and bar to mimic the concrete outside for a continuous look. Food-wise, they wanted the constantly changing menu of small plates served at D\u00e9viant to be the opposite of Vivant. Since Touitou has no kitchen in the 450-square-foot Vivant, he and his sous-chef cook behind the bar using two induction burners and an oven that\u2019s been broken for the past few weeks. And since D\u00e9viant diners and drinkers have little room in which to maneuver on the thick marble countertops, he wanted to ensure that the food can be eaten with fingers or a fork, spoon, or thick piece of bread.Photo by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eenePhoto by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneThat doesn\u2019t mean the food is simple. The tamarind-galangal sauce on those spicy chicken wings? It simmered for 10 hours. There are no charcuterie or cheese plates here to soak up the natural wine and beer. Instead, you might share a small bowl of mussels in a celery-peppercorn broth or seared foie gras with spinach and buckwheat. Dessert could be three just-right canel\u00e9s with whipped cream.Since he was 18, Touitou has worked in kitchens of Alain Ducasse at the Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e, Tatiana Levha at Le Servan, as well as at Pierre Gagnaire\u2019s Sketch in London. Nathan Allard and Aldwin Beets, the cooks running the how at D\u00e9viant, have worked at starred restaurants like Le Meurice and Senderens, as well as Le Dauphin, the seminal wine bar of I\u00f1aki Aizpitarte of Le Chateaubriand, the rebellious genius who has inspired Pierre\u2019s generation. (Le Dauphin\u2019s groundbreaking mirrored and marble interior by Rem Koolhaas and Clem\u00e9nt Blanchet can also be seen as a jumping-off point for D\u00e9viant\u2019s design.)Photo by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eenePhoto by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneWith D\u00e9viant, what you see from the street is what you get. Hence the desire to make it all look bigger. \u201cWe went with mirrors so you don\u2019t really realize that the actual space you have for the guests is ridiculously small compared to the size behind the counters, or when you take out toilet or the fridge and dishwasher in the back,\u201d Touitou said. \u201cWe were joking about being just like Vivant, where you can see every single part of the restaurant from the counter. But with the mirrors at D\u00e9viant, you can see the girl winking at you on the other side.\u201d The effect is very cool fun house, as those looking at the menus written on either mirrored wall can check out those doing the same on the opposite side.Photo by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneParisian kitchens are notoriously small. Look in the courtyard off of the kitchens of revered restaurants like Astrance and L\u2019Ami Jean and you\u2019ll most likely find crates of produce or a cooling pot of stock. Still, it\u2019s fun to watch the clown-car antics of the two chefs as they prepare the menu\u2019s 15-plus dishes to order on a single cooking unit equipped with a griddle and two induction burners. (A fryer is propped on top of a burner that remains off during service.) In addition to sharing a stove, they share that exposed square of space behind the counter with the manager and server. So their movements have to be tightly contained and more in sync than a Kardashian beauty launch.Photo by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneThe Vivant team worked with Mathieu Repetto, a young kitchen designer, or cuisiniste (yes, that\u2019s a thing in France), who is a friend and regular. Repetto took every dish\u2014its ingredients, its cooking technique, its sauces and garnishes\u2014into consideration when Jenga-ing the German Palux stovetop and the eight refrigerated drawers below it. The top line of drawers is for things that go into the oven above, followed by those destined for the induction burners and fryer; then the plancha, a few condiments, and things that need to be warmed. Items that are cut to order, like salads and herbs, are stored closest to the pass.Photo by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneRepetto also made use of the space above the bar, building lots of exposed shelves to store everything from the well-designed wooden boxes that once contained the haddock arrives in to rolls of paper towels and bottles of sriracha and ketchup for staff meal. Everything needs to be close at hand at all times, even during the day when the cooks prep along the counter. (Behind the sliding metal window in the back wall, you\u2019ll find the dish room and a fridge containing extra prepped ingredients for service, as well as a Japanese ice machine.)Photo by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eenePhoto by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneAs Touitou has learned during the design of D\u00e9viant and the upcoming renovation of Vivant, which he\u2019s doing with his 90-year-old architect grandfather, Paul Chemetov, \u201cThe less space you have, the more focused you are on every single inch.\u201d It also requires an extreme level of organization of one\u2019s workstation. \u201cYou develop a kind of choreography when you work,\u201d he said. \u201cIf your Microplane is always in the same place, and your lemons are, too, after a while you don\u2019t have to look for your Microplane\u2014or your lemon. I\u2019m pushing my cooks to have a precise place that is well thought out for everything: It allows you to focus on everything else.\u201d It\u2019s a lot of math and a lot of thinking, he concludes, \u201cbut it makes everything easier and faster. And you\u2019re less tired!\u201dPhoto by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneWith D\u00e9viant open until 1 a.m. and the kitchen serving until 11:15 p.m. \u2014a rarity in Paris, which makes it slammed on weekends\u2014those cooks need every trick they can to stay focused. Because in this restaurant, all eyes are on them.Photo by Xavier Girard Lacha\u00eeneExplore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurants + TravelParisRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
