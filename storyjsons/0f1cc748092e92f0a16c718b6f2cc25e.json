It\u2019s perfect for kids, to take on your commute, or for a road trip. We love to keep the filling classic with melty cheese, hot sauce, and avocado, but this recipe can be what you make it. Roll up whatever proteins, herbs, and veggies you happen to have on hand.IngredientsMakes 13large eggsKosher salt1Tbsp. unsalted butter112\" flour tortilla1oz. coarsely grated sharp yellow cheddar cheese (about \u2153 cup)\u00bdavocado, thinly sliced\u00bccup cilantro leaves and tender stemsHot sauce and sour cream (for serving; optional)PreparationStep 1Whisk eggs and a large pinch of salt in a medium bowl until very smooth and a little frothy, about 30 seconds.Step 2Melt butter in a 10\" nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add eggs and cook undisturbed until almost completely set but still a little runny 2\u20133 minutes. The idea is to cook them into a flat, round shape about the same size as the tortilla.Step 3Meanwhile, lightly toast tortilla over a medium-low flame, turning often with tongs, until warmed and lightly browned in some places, 5\u201310 seconds (or, toast in a large, dry skillet over medium-high heat until warmed and lightly browned in some places, about 1 minute per side). Transfer to a large piece of foil.Step 4Turn eggs with a rubber spatula, then slide out of skillet onto tortilla.Step 5Sprinkle cheese over eggs. Top with avocado and cilantro, leaving a 1\" border around the edges. Add a few dashes of hot sauce and dollop sour cream over, if using. Fold sides of tortilla over filling, then roll up to enclose. Wrap burrito in foil and let sit so cheese can steam and melt, about 3 minutes. Slice in half, if desired.How would you rate Breakfast Burrito to Go?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (3)Back to TopTriangleI have made these at least 4 times now - perfect work from home lunch! ClairePA, USA1/31/2022Can't wait to try these out! BrittJville, Florida8/22/2021I made these for 2 of us for a Sunday breakfast = really good. They were simple and I had all but the cilantro on hand. We added salsa and sour cream. Hot sauce is a must sprinkled over the egg before rolling. I used half cheddar and half pepper jack cheeses which gave it more flavor.  Also, I changed the eggs to 2 from 3 but our eggs were extra large. karenfarHuntington Beach, CA5/19/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titBurritoWrapTex-MexAmericanEggCheddarCheeseEasyQuickNut-FreeVegetarianFryBreakfastLunchRecipes you want to make.
