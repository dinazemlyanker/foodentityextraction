Those thick strands of pasta coated in velvety meat gravy are best eaten on cold nights when you want to wrap yourself in a blanket of red sauce and parm. But what if you took all the flavors of bolognese and turned them into a summer-friendly pasta. Well, that would be an amazing dish.This summer bolognese combines cherry tomatoes, chiles, basil, and just enough meat for a weeknight-friendly take on the classic Italian rag\u00f9. It was created by senior food editor Andy Baraghani, the genius behind BA\u2019s Best Bolognese (a three-hour, velvety meat sauce made from beef chuck, pancetta, white wine, and whole milk) and Healthyish\u2019s Cauliflower Bolognese (a vegetarian but no less satisfying version that draws richness and texture from chopped-up cauliflower and mushrooms). This latest version uses peak-season produce to create a sauce that\u2019s bright, fresh, and totally appropriate for August. Here\u2019s how it comes together:The sauceMost Bolognese recipes use a minimal amount of garlic (and sometimes none at all), but Andy uses eight thinly sliced cloves to create an assertive flavor without pancetta or beef chuck. Canned tomatoes can introduce too much water, so this recipe uses three pints of fresh tomatoes plus tomato paste to thicken the sauce and create ultra-concentrated flavor. Finally, a fresh chile (we like Holland or Fresno) adds fruity, bright heat to cut through the tomato sauce in a way those crushed red pepper flakes can\u2019t.The meatAndy creates a lighter meat sauce by using ground chicken instead of beef chuck, although ground turkey would also work well here. Ground meat can go rubbery if it\u2019s cooked too hot, so it\u2019s important to go low and slow to create a velvety texture.The pastaWe\u2019re partial to bucatini, spaghetti, or rigatoni for their sauce-soaking abilities, but use your favorite pasta shape. Just be sure to stop cooking when it\u2019s very al dente, so it can finish cooking in the sauce without going limp. (Helpful tip: Aim to take your noodles out of the boiling water about two minutes earlier than the package directions.) Once the pasta is in the pot with the sauce, add a knob of butter, some grated Parm, and \u00bd cup pasta cooking liquid to bring everything together. The final touch? Two heaping cups of basil, which will wilt and perfume the whole pot.All these elements add up to a Bolognese that\u2019s lighter and brighter but no less satisfying than the winter edition. It\u2019s the kind of Sunday sauce we crave in a heat wave\u2014but could make on repeat throughout the year.It's summer pasta night:Summer BologneseThink of this weeknight-friendly pasta recipe as a lighter take on the classic Italian rag\u00f9 that features cherry tomatoes, a red chile for some heat, and tons of fresh basil.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishBolognesePastaTomatoRead MoreLifestyle42 Tomato Recipes That Taste Like Summer in Every BiteGallery42 SlidesBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
