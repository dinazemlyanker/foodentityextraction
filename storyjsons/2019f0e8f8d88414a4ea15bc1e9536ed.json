An ingredient whose use sheds light on the complex racialized history of Southern cooking, potlikker was once valued only by diligent enslaved Africans who saved the nourishing broth for their families after cooking greens. Chef Carla Hall, for whom potlikker was an essential element of her childhood, switches up the order, making potlikker from scratch to use as an ultra-concentrated broth\u2014for Hall, that\u2019s often the first step in imbuing a dish with layers of powerful flavor. In this herbaceous version, Hall doubles down on the fennel\u2019s licorice notes by adding a glug of Pernod, an anise-based liqueur that\u2019s a natural pairing with seafood and vegetables.Use this potlikker as a base for Hall\u2019s Shrimp and Grits With Fennel Potlikker, her Lemony Spring Vegetable and Barley Bowl, or any dish that would benefit from an intensely aromatic broth.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Terrible website and app but wonderful recipe. Trying to leave five starts but website won\u2019t let me, for instance\u2026.Anonymous3/4/2022This is an amazing base recipe with so much flavor!  I made both the shrimp and grits and the asparagus barley recipe, and they were excellent.  I will use this potlikker often as a building block to add flavor to lots of recipes.  Thanks, Carla!  And I agree with others that the bad reviews aimed at the website are in poor taste and misleading about the awesomeness of this recipe.ShannonMadison, VA3/1/2022I had no Pernod so I addede a few fennel seeds to make up for that. The broth is insanely aromatic! I used it to make brothy bean stew and added a bit of lemoni omani. Great combination!\n\nThe BA series about potlikker has also inspired me to collect my veggie water for a week and experiment with it. Leek potlikker and fennel potlikker are my favourite so far. Gertrude Europe2/27/2022This is an amazing base for the grits in Shrimp and Grits with Fennel Potlikker.  Altha2/27/2022Full disclosure, haven't tried this recipe. But I saw the other two reviews rated this dish poorly based on the quality of BA's website, not on the dish itself. I thought that was in poor taste, so I'm rating this recipe five stars in advance and trying it as soon as I can get the ingredients. Friends, don't rate a chef's recipe poorly because you don't agree with the way the website is run. AnonymousBrooklyn, NY2/26/2022This website is awful. Signed up for full access and can\u2019t save recipes and constantly having to log back in. AnonymousBoston MA2/26/2022Your website sucks.  I subscribed to the site when I saw a dish I would like to try the Fennel Potlikker.  However the recipe disappears almost immediately and is replace by an ad   Lee BuzalekLandenberg PA2/20/2022Explore Bon App\u00e9titDinnerVegetarianVeganNut-FreeDairy-FreeGluten-FreeStockFennelVegetableSouthernAmericanSoul FoodRecipes you want to make.
