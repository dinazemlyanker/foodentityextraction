Pastry chef Betty Hung weaves Asian influences into her pastries at Beaucoup (milk tea croissants!), and they\u2019re phenomenal.ORDER THE: extraordinary kouign-amann, salted chocolate rosemary cookie, peanut butter sandwich cookie, yuzu lemon tart, and a scone sandwich for lunch.THE VIBE IS: sunny and upscale, frequented by elegant Kitsilano residents.PRACTICAL STUFF: Open Tuesday to Friday, from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.; and Saturday and Sunday, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. It\u2019s nice to eat inside, but tables in the small bakery can be hard to come by, so consider getting your treats to go.\u2014Lindsay AndersonYinger WongBetty HungWE ALSO LOVEEarnest Ice CreamGet the scoop on Vancouver\u2019s young, ambitious ice cream empire MaenamReinvented Thai cuisine (and cocktails) in Kitsilano   The Pie ShoppeEast Vancouver\u2019s beloved, scrappy, and downright delicious bakeryExplore City GuidesAtlantaAustinBostonCharlestonChicagoCopenhagenLas VegasLondonLos AngelesMexico CityMiamiMontrealNew OrleansNew YorkParisPhiladelphiaPortlandSan FranciscoSeattleTokyoTorontoVancouverWashington, D.C.GET THE MAGAZINEBA LogoBon appetitSUBSCRIBESign up for Updates on the Bon App\u00e9titCity GuidesSign UpWill be used in accordance with our user agreement and privacy policyBA LogoBon appetitSubscription FAQsMastheadNewsletter SignupAccessibility HelpRSS FeedsSite MapCond\u00e9 Nast StoreCareersBon App\u00e9tit Media KitDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCond\u00e9 NastFood Innovation Group: Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u00a9 2022 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
