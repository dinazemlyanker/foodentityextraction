Unfortunately, 2018 isn\u2019t at that level of agriculture or smart home automation yet, but there is a way to have tomatoes at the ready any time of year. We love using canned tomatoes for pasta sauces, soups, pizzas, braises, and generally anytime we\u2019re cooking tomatoes down. They\u2019re not made for slicing and topping sourdough toast, or chopping up for a salad, but they are an ideal pantry staple for that weeknight pasta pomodoro. In fact, they\u2019re better than fresh tomatoes for cooking whenever it\u2019s not peak summertime.Walk into any grocery store and you\u2019ll find an entire aisle of tomato products. So, what are the best canned tomatoes to buy? Easy: whole peeled. Every time. You can make them into anything you want from there, whether it\u2019s crushed for a sauce, in pieces for a soup, or left whole to gently simmer until they break down naturally.Canned tomatoes make 30-minute shakshuka possible.\nAlex LauIt\u2019s tempting to grab crushed or diced tomatoes in a can, because it seems like less work for you to do. But those cans\u2014especially diced\u2014often have additives like calcium chloride that are thrown in to help the pieces hold their shape. That means that diced tomatoes won\u2019t break down properly and melt into your sauce or stew, and you\u2019ll be left with big chunks of tomatoes.Instead, buy a can of whole peeled tomatoes and crush them yourself. Use our easy crushing method to not splatter tomato juice all over yourself in the process.Canned tomatoes are picked and canned at the peak of ripeness, and their skins are removed by steaming or other machine processing. On a label, you want to see the fewest ingredients possible: tomatoes (usually small romas, but they also sell cherry, salt (but not too much sodium so you can season yourself), and water or tomato juice. A little citric acid is okay because that's part of the canning process, but if you see basil, pepper, garlic, high fructose corn syrup, or any other preservatives you can\u2019t pronounce, find another can. You want them to be as bare bones as possible so you can add the seasonings that you want in the cooking process.You can (and should) use canned tomatoes for our new pasta pomodoro recipe.\nPhoto by Heidi's BridgeThe only way to find your ideal brand of canned tomatoes is trial and error. A good judge of quality is if the label says D.O.P. San Marzano, which means the tomatoes were certified to be grown and canned in within a specific Italian region, and are held to a specific set of standards. They will definitely be bright, full, and sweet, but usually more expensive\u2014about $5 or more per can. However, there are cans that say San Marzano but don't have the D.O.P. (\u201cprotected designation of origin\u201d) label; tomatoes can be San Marzano-style because San Marzano is also a varietal of tomato that is known to have less seeds and is meatier in texture than a roma. It is very confusing. It's best to look at the labels for a slim ingredient list, or splurge on D.O.P. if you can afford it. We find Muir Glen, to be a quality USA-grown, organic, widely-available brand. (You can buy a 12-pack of cans for $28 on Amazon.)Whether you\u2019re making pasta sauce, trying your hand at a homemade stromboli, or making shakshuka for brunch, reach for humble, dependable canned tomatoes. Maybe one day we\u2019ll have tomato-lined streets, but until then, keep your can opener nearby.Now go make the best and easiest canned tomato sauce of your life:Basically Spaghetti PomodoroAlmost as easy as opening a can of the store-bought stuff, and one hundred times more delicious.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titPastaTomatoTomato SauceBasicallyShoppingRead MorecookingHow 6 Chefs Doctor Up Canned TomatoesBy Alyse WhitneyshoppingCanned Cherry Tomatoes Exist and Our Food Editors Love ThemBy Elaheh NozaricookingCanned Tomatoes Are Better Than Fresh Ones (Yeah, We Said It)By Alex DelanycookingHow to Crush Tomatoes While Wearing a White ShirtBy Alex DelanyRecipes you want to make.
