After he died, I looked everywhere for the right one.By Lauren HakimiDecember 20, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration by Melanie LambrickFacebookTwitterEmailWhen my dad died two and a half years ago, my family faced a question: What do we do with all the pickles?Some swam in a container full of brine in the refrigerator. Most sat in cans in the garage, where they still remain, ready just in case he ever comes back. My dad really loved pickles.Sometimes, on Sunday mornings, he poured a can of them into a black plastic container and just ate the stubby things whole, one by one, until they were gone. That was how he taught me to eat them, too, and before I even learned the words \u201ccucumber\u201d and \u201cpickle\u201d I knew the Persian words \u201ckhiar\u201d and \u201ckhiar shoor.\u201d I would pluck them out of his Sunday lunches, and he\u2019d pretend to be angry at me for stealing his food. \u201cThat was for my own consump-shen,\u201d he\u2019d squeal, at the same time pushing his plate toward me.When I moved from Great Neck, New York, to Manhattan for college, one of the first things I did was look for cucumbers and pickles. I went to the typical chains: Whole Foods and Trader Joe\u2019s. The fruits there were unlike what I was used to seeing. The pickles came in jars, not cans\u2014some of them were even sliced, not whole. The cucumbers looked long and flimsy, more like zucchinis than the short, firm fruits I saw at my local kosher Persian grocery stores. It occurred to me that Great Neck\u2019s kosher grocery stores mostly sold Israeli and Persian varieties, not necessarily because these were objectively superior to other cucumbers (which they are!) but because Great Neck was full of Persian Jews like me. I bought Trader Joe\u2019s flimsy cucumbers but they languished in my refrigerator and I never ate them.It was even harder to find half-sour pickles. I\u2019d eaten them as a child when my dad took my siblings and me to Ben\u2019s, an Eastern European-style kosher deli in Wheatley Plaza on Long Island. When we sat down at the booth next to the statues of David and Goliath, there were always two little bowls on the table: one with coleslaw, and one with two kinds of pickles\u2014full-sour and half-sour. The full sours were all well and good, but it was the half sours, with their neon green color and promise of juiciness, that really appealed to me. My dad took note of my preference. He would go to a vacant nearby table and trade our full-sour pickles for their half-sour pickles so that I\u2019d have a whole bowl of the better type. Though he liked them too, he never took one from me. After a meal of fries and Dr. Brown\u2019s black cherry soda, I\u2019d sit in my dad\u2019s lap and eat a rainbow sugar cookie. Outside the restaurant, he fished a penny out of his pocket for me to throw into the fountain and make a wish, but I already had everything I could wish for.My family hasn\u2019t been to Ben\u2019s in years; my dad was usually the one who took us. That means I\u2019ve gone a while without half-sour pickles. It\u2019s not as though I didn\u2019t try to find some. I looked them up online but they were too expensive for me, and I\u2019m not much of an online shopper anyway. Then, on a recent Sunday morning in Great Neck, I insisted upon going grocery shopping with my mom (when she went alone, she never bought anything I asked for). There they were, oddly placed between the milk and hash browns at ShopRite: jars of Ba-Tampte half-sour pickles for only $3.49. \u201cThey probably won\u2019t taste like the ones at Ben\u2019s,\u201d my mom warned. \u201cBut if you want, take one.\u201dAt home, before I ate my favorite type of pickle for the first time in years, I was afraid it wouldn\u2019t taste the same anymore. I was afraid I wouldn\u2019t like them, like the Real American Chain Store patron I\u2019d become since starting college. But as I drained the brine in the sink and sat down to eat, the scent in my nose felt like a homecoming. I finally took a bite. So rubbery, so crispy, so juicy. I\u2019d forgotten how much of their textural power came from the little bumps on their skin. The item in my hand was no longer a pickle; it was a proper khiar shoor. I practically heard my dad utter those glorious words, his lips pursed for the \u201cshoor.\u201d I saw his eyes widen and his eyebrows move upward as he chewed. \u201cNashode be donya,\u201d he\u2019d say after he swallowed; out of this world. He said that about every fruit and every vegetable I ever saw him eat. After we buried him, the rabbi tried to assure me that heaven has everything. I don\u2019t believe in heaven, but that day, I suspended my disbelief. \u201cEven pickles?\u201d I asked, and everyone laughed. Yes, even pickles. The khiar shoor in my hand was nashode be donya; it was heavenly. I sat for a minute in awe. Then I reached for another, then another.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCultureLifestyleRecipes you want to make.
