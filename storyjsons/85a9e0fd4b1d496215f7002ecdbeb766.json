More! Bland! Potato! Salad!By Molly BazJune 25, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Pearl JonesFacebookTwitterEmailI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard about the whole \u201csalt your pasta water until it\u2019s salty like the sea\u201d thing, but have you heard the whole \u201csalt your potato water \u2018til it\u2019s salty like the sea\u201d thing? It\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re here to discuss.Answer me this: Is there anything worse than a bland potato?! All that monotonous starch with nothing to make it tasty is a royal waste. And the highest-impact way to avoid under-seasoned, taste-like-nothing potatoes is to salt the potato cooking water. (Sadly, if you skip this step, almost no amount of salt added directly to the cooked potatoes can redeem them.)Most people, in my opinion, are drastically under-salting their potato water. Think about it: Even when they\u2019re cut in half, potatoes are large, dense items. Salt has to penetrate a lot of mass in order to make it all the way through to the potatoes\u2019 middles by the time they\u2019re finished cooking.If adding 1 cup of kosher salt to your potato water (as in my recipe for Sour Cream and Onion Potato Salad) still seems like a lot, just think about how much of it is going down the pipes when you drain those potatoes. Nearly all of it! The cup of salt is there to make the potato water highly concentrated so that the salt can do its magic on those dense potatoes in the 15 or 20 minutes they take to cook through. Rest assured, I\u2019ve done countless tests to determine the right proportion of salt to water when boiling potatoes\u2014I urge you to trust the work of those before you.Beyond that, you\u2019ll probably end up adding some kind of fat to those potatoes after you\u2019ve cooked them (be it sour cream or mayonnaise in the case of potato salad, or olive oil in the case of crispy boys). When you\u2019re doing that initial boil, take into account that the fat will mask and dilute salt.So what if I\u2019ve been nicknamed \u201csalty girl\u201d over on YouTube due to my unwavering commitment to properly seasoned food? I\u2019m actually just unwaveringly committed to delicious food, and delicious food starts with properly seasoned food, and that all comes back to learning how to salt it.Yeah, I\u2019m a #saltygurl and I\u2019m proud of it. Join me in the Salty Girls' Club. I promise you it\u2019s super tasty over here.Ready, set, potato salad:Sour Cream and Onion Potato SaladThis recipe was an excuse to combine our favorite potato chip flavor with the creamy, salty \"salad\" of our dreams.
