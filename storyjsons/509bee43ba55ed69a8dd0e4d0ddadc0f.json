When autumn comes around, the trees turn from gray to...shades of grays. Blueberries are called grayberries. And blackberries are still called blackberries. Your whole world is gray. And then imagine one day you wake up and there\u2019s color. The world is shining. A new, beautiful view. You're living in the gosh darn Wizard of Oz. That\u2019s exactly what happens when you stop using pre-ground spices and start toasting whole spices at home. You tap into a whole new dimension of flavor you never knew existed.Okay, maybe that\u2019s a little bit of an exaggeration, but just slightly. If you\u2019ve read Basically before, you know that we\u2019re big fans of buying our spices whole and then toasting and crushing them right before we include them in a recipe. We do this because whole spices have a longer shelf-life than ground ones.When you buy pre-ground spices, you\u2019re essentially buying a shadow of what the spice once was. The minute a spice is ground, it starts to lose flavor. That means the ground coriander that\u2019s been sitting in the back of your spice drawer for the past two years doesn\u2019t taste much like coriander at all. To make spices taste as rich and vibrant as they possibly can, you'll want to toast them whole at home.Toasting spices in your kitchen is a simple process that doesn\u2019t require much time, effort, or technology. All you need is a skillet, a stovetop, and whatever spices you want to toast. Get out a dry skillet (no oil) that's big enough that all of your spices can fit in a single layer\u2014this ensures even cooking. Then set it over medium heat and don't step away from the stove.The heat draws out the oils from the spices, emphasizing and emboldening the flavor. Un-toasted cumin tastes like cumin, but toasted cumin? That stuff tastes like cumin\u2019s confident, more mature cousin. And that\u2019s all thanks to those released oils.So how do you know when your spices have been toasted? Well, there are a few signifiers. First, you\u2019ll notice a change in color in your spices. They\u2019ll darken as the heat starts to take effect. You might also hear your spices talking. No, no. Not talking. Popping. Some spices will pop as they toast. It\u2019s totally cool if they don\u2019t, but don\u2019t freak out if they do. And you\u2019ll also notice a smell\u2014well-toasted nuts give off a fragrant aroma. The whole process generally takes between 2\u20134 minutes, depending on your batch size.Be sure to remove the spices from the skillet immediately. Even if you turn off the heat, the spices will continue to toast in the residual heat of the pan. Transfer your spices to a bowl or rimmed baking sheet as soon as they\u2019ve hit the sweet spot.Photo by Laura Murray, Food Styling by Kat BoytsovaFrom here, you grind. If you have a mortar and pestle, excellent. That\u2019s our favorite tool for grinding spices. If you don't, no worries at all. You can lay your spices out on a baking sheet and crush them with a pint glass or a heavy mug, or you can throw them in a bag and crush them with a mallet. Or maybe you'll get really into it and buy a spice grinder.But there is one word of warning: If you take your spices too far, start over. Burnt spices taste bitter and aggressive, so if we\u2019re only talking about a couple minutes of your time, it\u2019s better to just toast a new batch. This is a colorful, brilliant, spicy new world you\u2019re living it in. Best keep it tasting as good as possible.Need a recipe for those toasted spices?Sheet-Pan Garam Masala ChickenMarinating in spiced yogurt gets you a juicy and super-tender chicken every time.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titSpiceRecipes you want to make.
