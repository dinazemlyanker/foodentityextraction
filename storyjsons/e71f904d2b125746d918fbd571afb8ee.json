Read while toasting.By Bettina MakalintalDecember 15, 2021FacebookTwitterEmailIllustration By: Tamara ShopsinFacebookTwitterEmailIn \u201cUnderrated,\u201d we review the ordinary rituals we build around food. Next up: buttering toast.\u00a0Every time I imagine buttered toast, it\u2019s perfect. The bread is golden, never charred. It\u2019s toasted enough to crunch when I bite into it, crispy-gone-soggy as the butter sinks in, but not so toasted that it crumbles. The butter is salted and soft enough to spackle the bread yellow from edge to edge without the knife scratching harshly. Sometimes, it\u2019s finished with crystals of flaky salt or a snowfall of sugar.When we think about food, we also think about anticipation\u2014and expectation. The more glowing a restaurant\u2019s reviews are, the higher our standards become. The more laborious the cooking process is, the more delicious a dish must be. The more we hype something up, the greater the chance that we\u2019ll be let down, and as the meme goes, expectation and reality aren\u2019t always the same. Buttered toast, by comparison, has low stakes, unless perhaps you\u2019re churning your own butter or baking your own bread. I didn\u2019t get into either of those as a pandemic hobby, so to me, it\u2019s just butter and bread.But it is butter and bread. Together, butter and bread subvert everything, becoming both what I expect and better than what I can think up. In my head, I can\u2019t taste the tiny\u2014but crucial\u2014variations between the bites with butter fully absorbed and the bites with butter still unmelted and creamy. In the full real-life 4D experience, I face a conundrum with each bite: Let the salt and slight sweetness linger, or go in for another piece and restart the cycle? This certainly isn\u2019t a question keeping me up at night; I can always toast another slice and make a new, better set of decisions.You might be into the basic toasting-then-buttering. Or you might flip the switch and try buttering-then-toasting (and maybe even buttering again). You might even fry the bread in butter in a pan, though I\u2019d argue that\u2019s fried bread and not buttered toast. As long as butter is on bread, I\u2019m happy, though I tend to lean Team Toast-Then-Butter\u2014why mess with the classic? Similarly, the combination is perfect no matter the ingredients. Value butter on squishy 99-cent loaves satisfies me as much as grass-fed butter on fancy sourdough.In fact, I feel the most affection for a version that might not even really have butter: In my earliest memories, the toast featured something more like margarine, layered on whatever white bread was available in the Philippines in the late \u201990s and dusted with a spoonful of white sugar. I like this the most when the sugar doesn\u2019t quite dissolve and embeds itself, still a little grainy, into the swipes of butter; it tastes like the creamed butter and sugar you stick your finger in while making cookies. Back then, toast with butter and sugar was a frequent snack\u2014I couldn\u2019t prepare much else as a barely-five-year-old after all. I now reserve it for rare occasions because I like it best with squishy white bread, which usually gets overridden in my limited storage space by the hefty loaves I prefer for my breakfast-slash-lunch tartines. But every time I make it, I bridge the person I am now with the pudgy bowl-cut kid I used to be. (And no, despite the recommendations, I\u2019ll never use cinnamon sugar\u2014I feel no nostalgia for that.)Buttered toast is safe and predictable, like my frequent choice to rewatch Sex and the City episodes rather than chance a few hours on a buzzy new Netflix series. It\u2019s a backup when I just don\u2019t have it in me to be disappointed, when so much else in life feels up in the air. Predictable, here, means something that\u2019s consistently, unfailingly delicious every time. In an age of endless hype and expectation, buttered toast is a balm against disillusionment and a break, however brief, from the idea that anything could ever let you down.Explore Bon App\u00e9titLifestyleCultureUnderratedRecipes you want to make.
