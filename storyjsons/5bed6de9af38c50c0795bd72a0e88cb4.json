Not Anymore.Eight years into my tenure as editor in chief, things look very different than they used to.By Adam RapoportMarch 26, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Emma FishmanFacebookTwitterEmailEvery Monday night, Bon App\u00e9tit editor in chief Adam Rapoport gives us a peek inside his brain by taking over our newsletter. He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.A few months back I somehow ended up on Reddit, reading a comments board composed entirely of fans of Bon Appe\u0301tit\u2019s YouTube channel. One user wondered where we shot all of our cooking videos. Another quickly chimed in: \u201cI\u2019ve heard them refer to the space as \u2018the Bon Appe\u0301tit test kitchen.\u2019\u201dOh. My. God.It hit me that half the people on this thread\u2014which, I imagine, fairly represent our 3.4 million YouTube subscribers\u2014had no idea what Bon Appe\u0301tit is. That we are a magazine. Or, at least, we used to be just a magazine. Or, still are\u2014but that we now do all sorts of other things. Or...Okay, so maybe Bon Appe\u0301tit is a bit harder to explain these days. Just looking around the office reminds me how rapidly things have evolved since I edited my first (print) issue of BA eight years ago.Minutes before this photo was taken, for instance, I was chatting with associate editor Hilary Cadigan, who\u2019s 31. I mentioned that the average reader of our magazine is basically the same age as her salt-and-pepper-haired editor in chief. I nearly had to help her pop her eyes back in her head.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!And I can\u2019t blame her. The audiences for the Instagram feeds of Healthyish, Basically, and BA\u2014how so many people, including most of us on staff, stay in touch with the brands\u2014skew far younger. Same goes for our YouTube channel, our podcast, and all the events we host.But as I constantly like to remind our editors, they\u2019re all connected, including, of course, the magazine. And that\u2019s by design. If you\u2019ve ever watched our videos\u2014Brad making kombucha and kvass, Claire reverse-engineering Twizzlers (from scratch), Carla and Andy and Molly and Chris cooking so many of the delicious recipes you see on these pages\u2014then you know that our editors do plenty of multitasking.Amanda Shapiro, who wrote the beautiful profile of Samin Nosrat in our latest issue, spends her \u201cday job\u201d editing Healthyish. Amiel Stanek, who edited our guide to a more sane, more organized kitchen in that same issue, also oversees our learning-to-cook site, Basically. And if you\u2019re a fan of our podcast, you\u2019ll hear him later this month, talking through that article.And that\u2019s the essence of all things BA\u2014the editors who develop our recipes and conceptualize our stories are the ones who star in our videos, whose iPhone photos fuel our Instagram, who guest-star on our podcast, who host our food festivals and live events.So yes, Bon Appe\u0301tit is a magazine. And it isn\u2019t. And I\u2019m more than okay with that. As a lifelong print editor who loves the permanency of the medium and the rigor of the editing process, I\u2019ll always cherish the privilege of being able to make something so beautiful and so lasting, month after month.But I also know that smart, engaging content resonates no matter the platform or the medium\u2014or the age of the reader (or user, or viewer, or listener).So what\u2019s Bon Appe\u0301tit in 2019? It\u2019s whatever you want it to be. Even a magazine.Cheers,Adam RapoportEditor in chiefExplore Bon App\u00e9titAdam NewsletterRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
