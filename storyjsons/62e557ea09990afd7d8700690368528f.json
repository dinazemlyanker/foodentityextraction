It gets better: If you\u00a0sign up for our newsletter, you\u2019ll get this letter before everyone else.With so much focus on COVID-19, I can\u2019t remember the last time I interacted with anyone grappling with a cold. Yet within the last week, it seems that colds are suddenly back in vogue. When the folks in my life get a cold, I\u2019m an evangelist for the healing powers of chicken soup. For my go-to, I smash star anise, whole cinnamon sticks, ginger, and green onions before saut\u00e9ing them in chili paste and adding chicken parts, a little fish sauce, and lots of soy to make a warming, comforting, and absolutely delicious soup.As much as I love it, however, even I sometimes need an alternative, especially when it seems like everyone\u2014children, neighbors, and colleagues alike\u2014are sniffling and sneezing, and I have to make my old chestnut again and again. Thankfully, our archives are full of options; there are over 20 in this gallery alone. Of all of variations, I was most drawn to Andy Baraghani\u2019s Feel-Better Chicken Rice Soup, which has a lot in common with my signature soup yet distinguishes itself with some key differences: It uses jasmine rice instead of rice noodles; lime instead of chili paste for that touch of acidity; and sweet potatoes, which are loaded with vitamins.Between wrapping gifts and baking cookies, bingeing on Succession and crying while watching It\u2019s A Wonderful Life\u2014do try our Feel-Better Chicken Rice Soup. It is a dish that all but the vegetarians in your life will find comforting, cold or no cold.Get the Recipe:Feel-Better Chicken and Rice SoupIf you want this take on classic chicken soup to have a similar consistency to congee, add 10\u201315 minutes to the cooking time.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titLetter From The EditorYou\u2019ve Got Time for ThiscookingRecipes you want to make.
