Especially the cheapest brands on the shelf, which are my favorites. A person needs a can opener.But too many can openers in this country are crusty with gunk, rusty with rust, and dusty with dust! Enough is enough. Invest a small fortune of $23 into this superior, smooth\u2014so smooth\u2014tool, which we've also ranked as one of our favorite can openers. The Oxo Smooth Edge can opener is clunky yet curvy and a little phallic in the way everything is if you cross your eyes long enough.Looking at life sideways is actually how the Oxo Smooth Edge can opener functions so expertly. You have to think sideways too. It took me awhile to figure out how to use it at my in-laws\u2019 last year, but with enough practice and the encouraging words of Cath asking me \u201cto show you one more time?\u201d\u2014I got there.Instead of stabbing down into your can of Manwich and cranking into the manly, meaty mush below, it stabs the SIDE of the can\u2019s lid and cuts neatly around it. Instead of teeter-totter-tilting a sharp-edged piece of metal out of the can with your fingers, now coated in sloppy joe guts, you can use the small clamp on the opener to remove the lid cleanly.If you\u2019re still curious (or confused), you can watch Paula\u2014an Oxo superfan who won a contest to find out who is the biggest Oxo-holic\u2014show how to use it in this YouTube video with a bow chicka wow wow soundtrack. Paula, I\u2019m with you. It\u2019s a great can opener.Nota bene: Because the cutting mechanism never comes in contact with the can\u2019s contents, you don\u2019t even have to wash, rinse, or swipe it with a paper towel after use. Put it back into the junk drawer from whence it came until next time.Your cans don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming:Photo by Laura MurrayOXO Good Grips\u00ae Smooth Edge Can Opener$22 at Amazon$23 at Bed Bath & BeyondExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingWhat To BuyRecipes you want to make.
