It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.I think about this salad a lot. It\u2019s green, it\u2019s crunchy, it\u2019s riffable, and it\u2019s sustaining. It\u2019s the platonic ideal for a winning grain salad, even though it\u2019s built on a base of cooked quinoa, which is technically a seed, but let\u2019s move past that.This recipe will teach you how to make a grain salad without a recipe, if you treat it as an example and follow its lead. I love how green and springy the version we photographed is, and while we call for broccoli, snap peas, and pea tendrils, the mix of vegetables is completely customizable to whatever produce moment you find yourself in. I would make this right now with flat pole beans and crunchy thin green beans, raw corn kernels, and cucumber rounds.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!I love that this salad instructs you to briefly blanch the vegetables, removing their raw taste, sweetening their flavor, and softening their bite. I love that it includes a crunchy fatty thing\u2014toasted pistachios, but you can use whatever nut you want\u2014a critical element in any good grain bowl, but one that people often leave out. It\u2019s got great proportions: cups and cups of vegetables and just enough grain to show up in every bite, without weighing everything down. This is one of those dishes that lets you shop with abandon at the farmers market or the grocery store, getting whatever looks good without worrying about what you\u2019ll do with it when you get home.Photo by Ted + Chelsea CavanaughThis grain bowl is plant-based and also filling, so you can listen to all the voices (intuitive and otherwise!) telling you to eat more produce and consume less meat without being concerned that you\u2019ll wish you had eaten more. It\u2019s got a creamy dressing that contains no cream, just herbs and nuts and olive oil that are emulsified in the blender, and it can be made with whatever tender herbs you happen to have, or grow, or like to use. It\u2019s a grain salad for weekend picnics and beach outings, but any leftovers will still taste great on Monday when you\u2019re looking for a lunch to tote to the office.The best part is that I can make this salad without having to think about it too much, which is good because there\u2019s this \u201clast weekend of summer\u201d situation gobbling up the majority share of my brain power. About that: This is a keeper recipe even though we can\u2019t keep this season forever. In a couple of months you can make it with tart apples, bouncy strips of Tuscan kale, shaved cauliflower, and diced fennel. And chances are, after you make this one, you might not even have to look at the recipe while you throw it together.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterRead MorecultureMy Favorite Farmers\u2019 Market Challenge RecipeBy Alex BeggscultureIs It Ever Okay...To Touch All the Tomatoes at the Farmers\u2019 Market?By Alex BeggscookingRun, Don\u2019t Walk, For Runner BeansBy Carla Lalli MusiccultureI Can Schlep Without Worry, Thanks to This Mesh ToteBy Aliza AbarbanelRecipes you want to make.
