There\u2019s cheese that you nibble off a platter, while saying things like, \u201cHmm, quite nutty.\u201d And then there\u2019s cheese that you melt and stretch and pull and gaze longingly at. But what's the best melting cheese? What varieties get you that gratuitous cheese pull you're after?Generally speaking, younger, fresher cheese is going to give you a better melt. You know, the softer stuff. Within that broad distinction we have some preferences. These are our 8 favorite cheeses to melt on top of sandwiches baked pasta, toast, and chili.BA's best breakfast sandwich is, well, the best.\nAmericanYeah, American is on this list, and yeah, we\u2019re calling it cheese, and it\u2019s the meltiest there ever was or will be. We don\u2019t love this one-noted, creamy cheese on everything, but if you see us making a burger or a breakfast sandwich, we\u2019ll be melting American all over it.Brad's eggplant parm is all about the mozzarella.\nAlex LauMozzarellaYou know the deal with mozzarella. It\u2019s pizza\u2019s best friend, the champion of the cheese pull scenario. Mozzarella, whether fresh or low-moisture, is extremely tame in flavor, so it makes a quick, clean, creamy hit to everything from meatball subs to roasted vegetables.Garlic bread grilled cheese. Enough said.\nPhoto by Josephine Schiele, styling by Ali NardiCheddarShredded cheddar is here for all your oozy dairy needs. Whether you\u2019re topping some chorizo chili or making a classic grilled cheese, shredded cheddar melts extremely well. It also brings that slightly sharp quality to the table to keep things interesting. Speaking of sharpness: If you want melty, go for younger cheddars rather than the aged ones, which have less moisture and don't melt as well.French onion soup, it's French.\nEva KolenkoGruy\u00e8reIf you\u2019re making a true French onion soup, gruy\u00e8re is what you want for that molten, cheesy top layer. It gets bubbly, crispy, and browned under the broiler, and pulls beautifully with each spoon-led expedition into the bowl. Young gruy\u00e8re is slightly sweet, salty, and nutty, but as you can probably guess, the driving flavor is milky creaminess.FontinaThis Italian cow\u2019s milk cheese has a flavor that isn\u2019t far from a mild provolone, but it is a little more grassy. We\u2019re fans of fontina in frittatas, and grilled cheese.Provolone is killer on a cheesesteak too.\nAlex LauProvoloneNot just any provolone though. We\u2019re talking deli-sliced provolone. And we love it melted over the protein in your sandwich. Roast pork. Chicken cutlets. Meatballs. Sausage. Anything, really. Get the stuff labeled \"sharp\" for a tangier, more aggressive kick.Sub in a little taleggio in a classic mac 'n cheese to keep things interesting.\nAlex LauTaleggioAnother Italian cow\u2019s milk offering. Taleggio has a washed rind, which brings a more pungent aroma to the table, but it\u2019s flavor is much more mellow, with hints of nuts, sweet fruit, and a bit of funk. We like blending in taleggio with other cheeses in dishes like macaroni and cheese, tomato pie, quiches, and savory tarts to make the flavor more complex.RacletteEver see a warmed half wheel of cheese scraped with a knife so all of it falls onto a mountain of potatoes or vegetables or meat below? Maybe in Switzerland? Yeah, that\u2019s probably raclette. It\u2019s a Swiss (or French) cow\u2019s milk cheese that brings fruity, sweet notes to the table. Again, it\u2019s creamy as hell, which seems to be the theme here.Lots of melty cheese things happening right here:Explore Bon App\u00e9titCheeseBasicallyProvoloneMozzarellaRecipes you want to make.
