Those ping pong balls of fried risotto save you from pre-dinner hunger pangs, or more likely from open bar\u2013empty stomach mistakes. See it, grab it, pop it. Arancini, I just wrote a commercial for you.Rather than deprive yourself of this joy the 360 days of the year you\u2019re not at a holiday party, why not make them at home and crack into the open bar under your TV? Great idea!For this recipe, Molly Baz had a vision: Huge molten arancini that spilled out cheesy risotto onto the plate like lava cakes\u2014a vision we shot down. \u201cArancini are party food, you can\u2019t have that,\u201d scolded Andy Baraghani, who we never thought would have so many arancini takes. \u201cAndy can\u2019t crush my dreams,\u201d Molly told me, so she\u2019ll save that recipe for another occasion. Still, these arancini are stuffed with sugar cube\u2013sized pieces of mozzarella, so that even when you bite into one, there\u2019s an oozy cheese pull to ooh and aahh over. As one does. The rest is about making risotto, chilling risotto, rolling risotto snowmen, and frying risotto. It\u2019s a labor of love, but aren\u2019t the best things in life? But\nlet\u2019s briefly look at each step at a time so you can see how attainable this is outside of a catering kitchen.Making risottoThe risotto part keeps it simple\u2014no peas here\u2014with onions, garlic, salty Parm, white wine, plenty of black pepper, lemon zest, and some heavy cream. Add stock, stir stir stir, the usual risotto bag of tricks. It\u2019s done when it\u2019s \u201ctoothsome,\u201d which is one of Molly\u2019s favorite words and which I never hear anyone else say, ever. But she means al dente, not mushy.Chill the risottoThen you spread the risotto out on a baking sheet to chill for an hour or four in the fridge. This will make it roll-able.Roll the risotto snowmenThings get messy! Using a \u00bc cup measuring cup will help you make consistent balls. You can do this with your bare hands or wear gloves, but you shape each ball into a sort of disc first, add two squares of mozzarella, and then shape the rice around it, rolling it into a snowman head. Freeze \u2018em for a few minutes so they can firm up.Fry the risottoMolly tested a few different crispy coating options. She ended with Panko and a traditional egg + flour dredge because other options (cornstarch slurry, regular breadcrumbs) didn\u2019t fry as evenly, or with as good of a crunch. You need a good crunch to contrast with the gooey filling, so this was an important detail.The biggest possible mistake you can make when frying the arancini is taking them out too early because you\u2019re impatient and want to get this party started already. They\u2019ll take 6-8 minutes and need to be DEEPLY golden brown. TEST one out of the oil by cutting into it to see that the mozz has melted. (This is your spider\u2019s time to shine!) Then take the others out. Then go mingle with your laughing, polite dinner guests, who\u2019ll be talking about those arancini for months to come.Last thingWe have a great mini recipe for a chile oil dip to serve with these, with oil-packed Calabrian chilies, garlic, and more lemon juice\u2014it really helps cut through the richness of the fat-on-fat-on-fat in the risotto.This recipe makes a party\u2019s worth of arancini, so please use this as an excuse to throw a party. Send paper invites. Buy tiny napkins. Make a bathtub of spritzes! Celebrate what blessings the fry gods have bestowed upon us.Get the recipe:Mozzarella Arancini (Stuffed Rice Balls)This is a labor of love that will make other people love you, which is reason enough to give this recipe a try.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titRisottoPartyCocktail PartyItalianRecipes you want to make.
