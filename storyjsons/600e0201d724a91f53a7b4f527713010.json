Perhaps even more so because, unlike any number of dishes that I love and can rustle up whenever I want, it\u2019s such a rarified treat\u2014a symbol of special times, flush times, we-could-all-die-tomorrow-so-why-the-f*#%-not times. I adore it dolloped atop still-warm blini as much as I adore it scooped up with salty potato chips as much as I adore it spooned over lacy latkes. But no preparation fills me with quite the same giddy delight as the caviar sandwich at Grand Central Oyster Bar inside New York City\u2019s Grand Central Station.It\u2019s easy to miss, an unassuming entry on the restaurant\u2019s sprawling menu of seafood dishes. And it smacks of sacrilege\u2014caviar, that most refined and luxury-signaling ingredient; the sandwich, that most pedestrian of formats. That was what piqued my curiosity the first time I ordered it. Caviar for the people! But it is perfect in its simplicity: two slices of toasted white bread layered with chopped hard boiled egg and a fat schmear of black bowfin caviar\u2014an affordable-yet-still-delicious roe harvested from a relative of the famed sturgeon\u2014served alongside a plastic sidecar of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche for dipping and a sprig of curly parsley. It\u2019s crunchy, and salty, and just the right amount of fishy, a tidy little package of deliciousness. And at $14, it exists in a cheeky sort of limbo: Is it a kind-of-expensive sandwich or a kind-of-cheap caviar dish?On the best of days, it\u2019s both: a not-unreasonable splurge that makes me feel like I\u2019m getting away with something\u2014a Big New York Mood if there ever was one. Sitting at one of Grand Central Oyster\u2019s too-low U-shaped bars, that iconic Deco tiled ceiling glowing overhead, with an icy gin martini in one hand and a triangle of caviar sandwich in the other, I feel like a little prince for all of the five minutes it takes me to eat it. And that\u2019s a hell of a way to feel, even for a moment.Go there: Grand Central Oyster BarExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendRestaurantsNew York CityRead MorerestaurantsThis French Bistro Is the Reason You Should Visit Los Alamos, CaliforniaBy Rachel KartenRecipes you want to make.
