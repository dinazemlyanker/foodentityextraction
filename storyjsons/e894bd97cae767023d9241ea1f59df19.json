Did it start with \u201cDueling Shrimp,\u201d a wreath of alternating deep-fried and boiled shellfish, with a pool of rubber-duck yellow and chunky cocktail sauces pooled in the center? Were the pastas served on giant platters the size of a toddler, and the salads piled six inches high? What about plastic tablecloths and water glasses? Was the floor kind of slippery, like it was polished with olive oil? Did you bring home 12 boxes of leftovers?I didn\u2019t think so.New York City is spoiled with spectacular tasting menus; throw a rock and you\u2019ll hit more chef\u2019s counters than Chipotles. But nothing compares to the chef\u2019s table experience at L&B Spumoni Gardens in Gravesend, Brooklyn. It\u2019s less a hushed affair for ooh-ing and ahh-ing at tweezer-assembled bites of hyper-seasonal, hyper-local, hyper-pricey ingredients (ah, yes, sea beans!) than it is an excuse to order everything on the menu in Costco-size bulk. Doesn\u2019t that sound wonderful?Eighty years in, those family feels are alive and well.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanA bunch of us at Bon App\u00e9tit thought so\u2014and so did a lot of other people one Friday night about a month ago. Local families, regulars celebrating birthdays, big groups of hipsters, and very hungry couples were packed like cannelloni inside the kitschy Greco-Roman-ish dining room and its adjacent atrium, complete with \u201cmarble\u201d statues of cupid in various poses, a mirrored ceiling, and hand-written black light signs. \u201cIs anyone observing Lent?\u201d our waiter asked as we settled in. \u201cNo, but can you help us with a bottle opener?\u201d senior editor Amiel Stanek asked as he pulled out six bottles of natural wine, bless him. And so began our L&B Spumoni Gardens red sauce baptism.The four-course chef\u2019s table can be prepared to serve anywhere from two to 200 people, at $50 to $70 a pop\u2014depending on your selection. (Also unlike other chef\u2019s tables, you actually get some level of choice.) Our \u201cOpening Act\u201d began with fried mozzarella wedges, baked clams casino style, the aforementioned shrimp two-ways, and a mountain of romaine, tomatoes, radishes, red onions, and parm, stacked high like a savory shave ice. For the second course, \u201cPasta-bilities,\u201d enormous platters of penne with broccoli rabe and peppery sausage and linguine studded with clams and lots of garlic hit the table. Next came textbook slabs of chicken parm; tender, thin pork chops with peppers; and \u201ccatch of the day\u201d branzino with an orange sauce that might have been squash. We shrieked with delight at every dish. We Instagrammed everything. We unabashedly stuffed our faces, and then bashfully asked them to bag the things we couldn\u2019t finish.So. Much. Food.\nPhoto by Emma FishmanThat\u2019s when the real closer landed like some great maximalist artwork: an architectural array of ice cream cones, Crayon-colored green and yellow ice cream in emoji-like scoops, great puffs of whipped cream topped with maraschino cherries, and a secret puddle of chocolate sprinkles we only found once we\u2019d made a mess of it all. After we picked at the cherries and finished the last drop of wine, we paid the bill and started divvying up the leftovers. On our way out, we looked back on the happy scene and spotted a sign. It glowed with a very L&B kind of encouragement to return very soon: \u201cHe may have sacrificed his life for you, but he rose for our chef\u2019s table. Happy Easter.\u201dElyse Inamine is the digital restaurant editor at Bon App\u00e9tit.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRed SauceItalian AmericanBrooklynRestaurantsRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
