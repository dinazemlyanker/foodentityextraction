He shares recipes he's been cooking, restaurants he's been eating at, and more. It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.\u201cSteak and baked potatoes tonight.\u201dThat\u2019s all the text said and that\u2019s all it needed to say.As much as I appreciate learning about new ingredients, techniques, and cuisines here at Bon App\u00e9tit, sometimes I just want to run it back old school.So when Simone texted me with her plans for dinner, I was all in. And I immediately thought of Alison Roman\u2019s feature in our September Issue.Roman, who has logged more than a few dinners at Keens Chophouse on West 36th Street in Manhattan, aptly points out that if you nail the details, you can approximate a steak dinner that will even exceed that of most temples of dry-aged beef.Want this letter before it hits the website?

Roman endorses pre-batching a pitcher of 50-50s\u2014half dry vermouth, half gin, served on the rocks with an olive. My wife likes a vodka martini, shaken, two lemon twists, up. The point is, you get to mix the iconic cocktail exactly the way you want it, and you don\u2019t have to pay $18 for it.Speaking of how you want it, let\u2019s talk about baked potatoes. You know how you don\u2019t want it? Wrapped in foil, the skin all steamed like a soggy newspaper. Roman and contributing editor Andrew Knowlton know better\u2014rub up your russets with olive oil, hit them with a generous sprinkling of kosher or sea salt, and some cracked black pepper. Then place them directly on the rack of ripping hot oven. The skin emerges all crackling crisp, the interior all fluffed up, awaiting an absurd amount of butter, sour cream, chives (more subtle than scallions), and if you\u2019re fancy like best-selling author Roman, a dollop of caviar.Photograph by Michael Graydon + Nikole Herriott, Food Styling by Alison Roman, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiAnd the steak itself? (A) Buy the best you can afford. (B) Preferably dry aged. (C) If you want to be like Roman, and not smoke out your apartment, you can go the slow-roasted prime rib route. Oven > stove top; less hands-on hassle.But a three-bone prime rib wasn\u2019t an option at my butcher, so I got a two-inch-thick porterhouse, and did like Roman\u2019s boy Bobby Flay, who utilizes a cast-iron skillet and a broiler to bring Brooklyn\u2019s famed Peter Luger\u2019s buttery, sizzling steak to your kitchen. It\u2019s kind of a genius technique. I highly recommend it.I could go on about needing something green on the table, and a classic dessert.
