This allows for a thinner but still super-crispy coating. \u201cMy late mother\u2019s fried chicken recipe was a link to my past\u2014and to my daughter\u2019s future. Frying chicken right can feel like riding a bike backward. Or writing a sonnet. It\u2019s hard, sometimes elusive. But there is a form to guide you, and with practice you can find the flow.\u201d Read more about this fried chicken recipe and it\u2019s significance to Kwame here.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Used peanut oil instead of vegetable oil.\n\nWould make again. MarcVineyard Haven, MA7/30/2021This was awful I nearly burned my house down. Have had much better.Brushjlsolon, oh7/16/2021I made this last night with some adaptations for a family gathering where half of us are gluten- and nightshade-free. I omitted the paprikas, used an AIP-friendly homemade curry blend, and swapped in cassava flour for the all-purpose. It was a total hit! The curry powder smelled strong in the dry flour mix but didn't read as curry in the final product, just a beautiful spice blend. I could have probably halved the flour coating as not a lot seemed to stick, but it still gave a nice crunch. (Also, cassava flour can be pricey and it pains me to waste it. We saved and froze the excess to use on another batch sometime.) I had the pieces uncovered in the fridge for about 6 hours before breading and frying, and next time may just do the 30-minute room temp method to see if that helps more coating stick. We also had a great bird: a pasture-raised smallish chicken from a local craft butcher who chopped it up for us. Really looking forward to making it again!M\u00f3rNew York, NY7/12/2021What is this \"spoiled milk\" everyone is talking about??  Buttermilk is NOT spoiled milk, it's just the leftovers from making butter or simply milk with a little vinegar/lemon juice added to it. Spoiled would imply that it is past it's safe-to-consume-by date, which buttermilk is not. Ya'll have issues if you think sour cream or buttermilk is spoiled.Anonymous7/9/2021My wife has celiac.  Any ideas about replacing the flour with something gluten free?  Corn starch? Rice flour? A blend of flours? I hesitate to use a ready made blend as they usually have xantham gum which might be counter productive.  Thanks.MSFDetroit7/9/2021Yes! Someone finally posts a real SOUTHERN fried chicken recipe. No self respecting southerner would ever use spoiled milk to make chicken. This is how we do it, cut the chicken up, flour it, then fry it. Shame she threw the backs away, thats my fave piece.\nAce DavisFrom NC, live in Hawaii6/21/2021New Jerseyan here visiting family in Mississippi... I just read this article to my 83-year-old momma and she said, \u201cWell, people can season it however they want to, but the real secret is finding itty-bitty chickens and cutting them up yourself.\u201d  An itty-bitty chicken (2 1/2 lbs or so) are near \u2018bout impossible to find, but we found two at the Winn-Dixie this weekend.  It remains the best chicken I\u2019ve ever eaten...in momma\u2019s words, \u201cTastes like the yards birds from my childhood.\u201d By the way, she uses salt and black pepper only.JonChesterfield, NJ6/13/2021Pamme, you can strain the oil into a jar, refrigerate it and reuse it numerous times. When time to dispose of it just put the jar of old oil into the garbage for pickup.MickeySouthern California 6/12/2021Can anyone tell me how you dispose of the leftover oil? I am on a septic system and never want to fry because I don't know how to get rid of the oil.Pamme6/12/2021I made this last evening. It is unimaginably delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. This will now be a staple in our home. It makes a delicious sandwich as well, on a buttered, toasted bun and just a few sweet pickles. Heaven. AnonymousPark City, Utah 6/8/2021Thank you! This is the first time I\u2019ve read a recipe for fried chicken that is like my mother\u2019s. In her case it was just flour, salt, and pepper, but the key is definitely the brown bag!AnonymousPortland, OR6/8/2021Thank you for sharing your mother's fried chicken recipe. I feel the preciousness in your rendition and of comments left by those of us who were lucky enough to have mom's who made us fried chicken, recipes that became our favorite family recipe of all. Everyone in our family grew up relishing my mother's fried chicken, marveling at its simple perfection. To this day, we remember and long for it, as she left us in 2007. I loved being taught my mother's recipes and made a point to watch her make her fried chicken so I could at least try to mimic her method and maybe come close to hers (futile, as she had the magic touch). She used to tell me her mom's and grandma's fried chicken were much better than hers, which I cannot even imagine. \nMy mother was midwestern, born and raised in Chicago. Her recipe used only well-but simply seasoned flour, similar to this recipe, on chicken pieces that were rinsed and patted dry. No egg, no milk or buttermilk, etc. And the method matches this one - the chicken pieces were shaken in a medium paper bag. When I read that in this method, I decided I had to chime in on the reviews! I still do it this way to this day. And all she used to season the flour was salt and pepper, and instructed me to be sure to use PLENTY of each so the flour was really well seasoned. In a frying pan, with about 1/2 inch or so of a combination of oil and butter, letting it get really brown and crusty on each side before turning. Also, no poking the chicken while it's cooking - that releases the juices that would be missed while biting into it:) \nI would only add, I don't think we have to call this southern fried chicken, just fried chicken. For my brother's birthday, and my son's, to this day, I make them fried chicken, mother's way. They love nothing more. Thank you for sharing your recipe and i'll give it a try!JeanDel Mar, CA6/8/2021Im from New Orleans, never heard of fried chicken without the skin on it, or seasoned with cumin ,or curry powder either.AnonymousNew Orleans6/7/2021To Anonymous: Fellow Southerner here, NC. Far as I know, REAL Southerners, as you call them, come from any of a dozen or so heritages and traditions and mostly cook accordingly. Just like with 'cue or pimento cheese, I've seen more versions of Southern fried chicken than I can count. Sad to say, I don't make my grandmothers' (NC and TN) because I didn't pay enough attention back then. But I'd make Kwame's mother's any day, tho' probably without the thermometer.SusanNC6/5/2021Fried chicken ALWAYS has skin on.
