By starting the curd on the stovetop, you\u2019ll ensure that it sets quickly when transferred to the oven, which will keep its texture soft yet sliceable. The secret ingredient\u2014okay, it\u2019s cream of tartar\u2014provides a sour counterpoint that keeps these from being cloyingly sweet, and the buttery vanilla shortbread offers just enough heft to anchor the curd while still keeping the bars melt-in-your-mouth tender.If you do happen upon the fresh fruit, buy it\u2014we love it spooned over each bar as an optional garnish that offers pops of crunch to counter the silky curd below.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Line an 8x8\" baking pan, preferably metal, with overlapping sheets of parchment paper, leaving generous overhang on all sides. Whisk flour, granulated sugar, salt, and baking powder in a large bowl to combine. Add butter and vanilla and mix with a rubber spatula until butter is evenly distributed. The dough should stick together in clumps while still remaining crumbly.Step 2Transfer dough to prepared pan (you may find it easier to form into a ball first instead of working with clumps\u2014entirely up to you) and press into pan in an even layer, working it all the way to the sides and corners.Step 3Bake shortbread until top and edges are golden brown, 13\u201317 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool.Curd and assemblyStep 4While the shortbread is cooling, whisk flour, cream of tartar, and salt in a small bowl to combine. Vigorously whisk eggs, egg yolks, passion fruit juice, lemon juice, and granulated sugar in a large saucepan just to combine. Add dry ingredients and whisk to incorporate.Step 5Set saucepan over medium heat and cook curd, whisking constantly and making sure to get into the corners of the pan, until it begins to release steam and thicken, 9\u201312 minutes. Immediately remove pan from heat, add butter, and whisk until smooth.Step 6Pour hot curd through a fine-mesh sieve onto shortbread crust, using a rubber spatula to scrape off any curd that clings to the bottom of sieve. Spread curd into an even layer, working it all the way to the sides and corners. Tent a sheet of foil over baking dish to cover loosely and bake 12 minutes.Step 7Reduce oven temperature to 325\u00b0 and remove foil from pan. Continue to bake bar until sides of curd are set but center still jiggles slightly when pan is gently shaken, 8\u201310 minutes more. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let bar cool, about 1 hour. Cover pan tightly with plastic wrap and chill at least 3 hours before serving.Step 8Just before serving, slice passion fruit bars into 2\" squares and top with spoonfuls of fresh passion fruit or dust with powdered sugar with a fine-mesh sieve if desired.Do ahead: Bars can be baked 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.How would you rate Passion Fruit Bars?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (6)Back to TopTriangleWhy are these measurements different than what is in the magazine? Don\u2019t bother with this recipe.  It\u2019s not worth the effort. Very greasy shortbread and the ratios are off. You can hardly taste the passion fruit anyway. AnonymousChicago 3/6/2022This is really not a great recipe -- the curd is flavorless and the shortbread is oily :(AnonymousNew York, NY3/2/2022Gritty crust weeping butter - even after it cooled. The passion fruit curd is too sweet. There are better recipes on the internet which require less effort and yield much better results. AnonymousNew York, NY2/25/2022Yummy, but time consuming, and worth it. Buttery crunchy crust, and I used 100% frozen passionfruit (Whole Foods sells in thee frozen fruit section ), as opposed to juice which is sometimes diluted with other juices, losing tartness.  I wasn't sure why flour was used in the curd.  I've made curd without it and it's perfect.   Some small flour lumps remained which is possibly why this recipe calls for putting the curd  through a sieve.  This part added on much more time/work.  If I make these again, I'm skipping the flour and saving the time, and I'm guessing they'll be just as good.  Cant wait to serve them to end my dinner party this Sat! Thank you.Alli F.Lower Merion, PA2/24/2022@Confused Baker:\n\nIt stays in the 8X8 pan; only the foil on top is 12X12. \nThe oven temp is reduced to 325 from the original 350 (from step 1) Anonymous2/21/2022I feel like there are steps missing such as  when do you put the shortbread back into the baking dish that's now 12*12 as well as what should the oven temperature be when baking the curd and shortbread together for 12 minutes. Reduce the oven temp to 325 but from what? When removing foil from the pan, is it the 12*12?
