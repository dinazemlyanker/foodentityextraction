Each week you\u2019ll hear from one of them: wine educator Kyla Peal, bartender turned brand ambassador Jenny Feldt, farmer Kristyn Leach, and line cook Peter Steckler. Here Steckler shares about how the vaccine is impacting his job; business at American Elm, the Denver restaurant where he works; and customer behavior and how trust is crucial to success and safety. Read his first and second diary entries here.I got vaccinated this morning and I already feel safer. I know that\u2019s not exactly how the vaccine works, but I felt immediate relief. I was so excited to get the shot\u2014the first of two Moderna doses\u2014that I drove an hour up to Greeley to get it. Restaurant workers were eligible for it beginning mid-March here in Colorado, and I spent the past couple weeks looking for an appointment. It\u2019s not as easy as it sounds. Appointments book up fast, especially with so many being eligible at the same time. Everyone at the restaurant, especially our general manager, was good about sharing resources and alerting us to special industry vaccination events, but the timing never worked out for me.As far as I know, everyone at the restaurant is planning on getting vaccinated. A lot of them already got the Johnson & Johnson one-doser, so there\u2019s an increased feeling of safety associated with that. That said, I\u2019m wary of talk about lifting the mask mandates (Editor\u2019s note: The governor of Colorado recently extended the mask mandate for a majority of the state for another 30 days). It feels like we\u2019re so close to getting through this, and I want everyone to be as safe as possible until it\u2019s over. I see trust as being a core value in this industry and in this job. Our kitchen staff is showing up to work every day, and it\u2019s based on trust\u2014trust that we\u2019re doing right by each other and trust that the patrons in the dining room are following the rules, being responsible, and keeping us safe at work. It\u2019s mutual. I\u2019m happy that at American Elm we\u2019re not easing up on the rules. We\u2019re still doing daily temperature checks and regular COVID testing for staff, and we\u2019re keeping the mask mandate for staff and diners going until it\u2019s absolutely clear that they\u2019re not necessary anymore. I think that\u2019s the most responsible thing to do, at least through spring and summer.This trust is important, especially now because I feel like there\u2019s going to be a serious restaurant boom. Besides the nicer weather, I think we\u2019re going to get a rush of people who may not have eaten out for the last year or who are just more comfortable coming out because they got vaccinated. We occasionally hear back in the kitchen about a table of guests who are out to dinner for the first time since this all happened. It\u2019s pretty cool to be a part of that.Because we\u2019re expecting this restaurant rush, we\u2019re trying to beef up staffing. But for as long as I\u2019ve been working in the industry, it\u2019s been tough to hire enough workers to fully staff the restaurant. There\u2019s a labor shortage in the hospitality space and I think it\u2019s only intensified with COVID. We\u2019re certainly feeling it. One of our newer line cooks left, so we\u2019re trying to hire more, but it takes time to hire and train and get everyone in the flow. At this point we don\u2019t have the bandwidth to continue cooking for guests at the restaurant on top of everything we\u2019ve been doing over the past year to survive. Our restaurant has been really good at creating different ways to feed people: takeout, meal kits, the special events. Over the last year we\u2019ve learned that there\u2019s viability in to-go, and that\u2019s awesome. But now that more and more people are dining in, we don\u2019t have the bandwidth to do as much takeout as we were able to do before.Last year we did a massive Mother\u2019s Day meal; it was the week after I started working here. This year we\u2019re not doing something as big as that since we don\u2019t have enough staff to make it work. Ideally. we\u2019d be able to do it all: in-house, takeout, special events. Hopefully, we can hire some new workers and be ready for that restaurant resurgence going into spring and summer.Explore Bon App\u00e9titRestaurantsRestaurant DiariesRecipes you want to make.
