Chopped garlic? Check. Toasted nuts? Check. Soy sauce in one tiny bowl and gochujang in another? Check, check. It\u2019s sort of like how I used to make sure my fly was zipped and my shoes were tied and my fly-away hair was fully contained before entering the office building.But while there\u2019s a lot of emphasis placed on mise en place as THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD, it\u2019s not always that critical for the average home cook\u2014a person who isn\u2019t plating a hundred meals over the course of a couple of hours. Of course if you\u2019re making a super fast-cooking dish like a stir-fry where you don\u2019t have time to pause, the mise en place will keep you on track. And if you\u2019re building a stew with lots of spices, it will stop you from rummaging around in the pantry for ground coriander while the turmeric is burning.A cute set-up with a million tiny measuring cups!\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re making a recipe, like this cheesy greens gratin, where the cooking happens in progressive stages, with inactive time between each part during which you could prep for the next. In that case, setting up your mise en place can actually waste time and, if you\u2019re divvying ingredients into bowls, create a lot more dirty dishes.Here on Basically, our recipes are written to walk you through the mise en place process. We list all of the ingredients in their unprepared form, then tell you exactly when to slice, measure, or mix. But most of Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s recipes (and most recipes in the world at large) expect that you do that mental work yourself. If you\u2019re thinking to yourself \u201cuh, rude,\u201d remember that recipes that do not incorporate all of the prep into the directions tend to be shorter and easier to digest.When you\u2019re deciding whether to mise (and how to do it), first, read the recipe. Seriously though! This is so that you don\u2019t get burdened with a three-hour marinade at 7 p.m. and so that you get a grasp of how quickly things come together. The faster the cooking process, the more important it is to mise. Otherwise, you risk over-cooking one ingredient while you prep the rest.And if you decide that you are going to mise, remember this:The ingredient list contains your prep list, too. Ingredients are numbered in the order they\u2019re deployed. So when the first few ingredients come with a preparation note, like \u201c3 garlic cloves, crushed,\u201d check that off your list before you advance even to step one. Ingredients that come later can be prepped later, too\u2014as long as there\u2019s plenty of inactive cooking time in between.Combine anything that goes into the pot/skillet/pan at the same time in the same bowl. It might look cute to have the sesame oil in one tiny container and the soy in another, but early consolidation will save you from the dish-washing blues later.Use a sheet tray to stay organized. Arrange your bowls on a half- or quarter-sheet tray so that everything is contained and can move together from your prep space to your cooking space.Mise en place includes equipment, too. It\u2019s just as important to take a roll call of your ingredients as it is to make sure that your one whisk isn\u2019t buried in a dirty dishwasher before you get to the \u201cwhisk constantly\u201d phase.If you've messed up, it\u2019s (usually) okay to pause your cooking. Your chopped onion is burning on the stove as you\u2019re frantically trying to peel ginger, grate garlic, de-seed a chile, and FaceTime with your best friend. In these circumstances, it\u2019s usually okay to turn off the stove and move the pan off the heat. It\u2019s often better to take a brief pause before returning the pan to the heat than to watch the whole thing go up in flames (metaphorically of course).And, of course, it helps if you\u2019ve gotten your basic knife skills in order, too. You\u2019ve got this!Ready, set, mise:Spicy Chicken Stir-Fry With Celery and PeanutsThis one-skillet recipe is fast and furious\u2014ideal for those nights when you have 10 minutes to stand at the stove, tops. The cooking technique is in the tradition of Chinese stir-fry, in which proteins and vegetables are chopped small so that they cook quickly over high heat, then bound together with a cornstarch-thickened sauce.View RecipeRecipes you want to make.
