Fraisage uses the heel of your hand to smear the tart dough across your work surface to create a smooth dough that rolls out with minimal cracking.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt2firm but ripe pears (such as Anjou, Bartlett, or Packham), thinly sliced\u00bccup sliced almondsPowdered sugar (for dusting)Special equipmentA 9\"-diameter tart pan with removable bottomPreparationtart shellStep 1Whisk cocoa powder, salt, and 1\u2153 cups flour in a medium bowl. Beat butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-low speed until combined, about 2 minutes. Beat in egg. Reduce speed to low; with motor running, add dry ingredients. Mix just until a soft dough forms. Using a rubber spatula, fold in any remaining dry streaks of flour.Step 2Transfer dough to a surface; gather into a ball. Using the heel of your hands, smear dough straight out across surface by a full arm\u2019s length, then using a bench scraper, gather dough back up into a ball. Smear and regather dough 2 more times; flatten into a disk. Wrap tightly in plastic and chill until firm, at least 2 hours.Step 3If dough is very firm, let sit at room temperature 10\u201315 minutes to soften slightly. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to about a \u00bc\"-thick round, dusting with flour as needed. Carefully transfer dough to tart pan and gently press into bottom, corner, and sides of pan, letting excess hang over edges. Run rolling pin over top of pan to shear off excess dough. Prick bottom of dough all over with a fork. Chill in freezer 1\u201312 hours.Step 4Arrange a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 325\u00b0. Bake tart shell until firm and dry to the touch and starting to pull away from edges of pan, 14\u201318 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool.Do ahead: Dough can be made 1 week ahead. Keep chilled, or freeze up to 1 month.Filling and assemblyStep 5Increase oven temperature to 350\u00b0. Whisk almond flour, all-purpose flour, and cocoa powder in a medium bowl. Beat butter and sugar in the clean bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a clean paddle attachment on medium-low speed until fluffy, about 5 minutes; scrape down bowl. With motor running, add eggs one at a time, incorporating completely before adding the next one. Reduce speed to low; add dry ingredients and beat to combine. Add chocolate, vanilla extract, almond extract, and salt and beat until smooth.Step 6Spread frangipane evenly across bottom of tart shell. Top with pear slices to cover, fanning out to make an attractive pattern (you might have some left over\u2014snack away!). Scatter almonds around edges of tart and bake until pears are tender and frangipane barely jiggles when pan is gently shaken, 40\u201345 minutes. Transfer tart to wire rack; let cool.Step 7Just before serving, dust edges of tart with powdered sugar.Do ahead: Tart can be baked 2 days ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.How would you rate Chocolate-Almond Pear Tart?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (5)Back to TopTriangleI made this for Thanksgiving (2021) and it was a big hit!!! We had a guest who is a French chef and he was very complimentary of the end result. I used gluten free flour in place of regular flour and that is the only change to the recipe I made. Having never made anything this complicated before I followed the instructions and technique exactly. It was SO GOOD. So. Stinking. Good. Enjoy :)ErinSan Diego, CA12/30/2021I made this first (as a trial run) and it is fabulous!  I did add about 1/2 c of almond flour to the tart shell to give it a little more structure ... I added 4oz of almond paste to the filling (in small dice size pieces as the filling was mixed in a stand mixer on high speed) ... I will bake the next tart a little longer and will make it a day before I will be giving it (to my Dr) so I can refrigerate it ... it is better after being refrigerated.  Like I said, the first one was a trial run.Donna Charleston SC11/29/2021Absolutely fabulous. A friend brought this to Thanksgiving and it stole the show. The filling is extremely rich & decadent but balanced by the crisp light pears. I will be making at Christmas hoping it turns out just as elegant & delicious. EmilyLos Angeles11/26/2021I followed the ingredients, but not the techniques and had good results. I made the tart shell in the food processor, pressed it in, and aside from having way too much dough, it came out fine. I also made the filling in the food processor and it came out very good. Although the recipe says you may have extra pear slices using only 2 pears, I used almost 3 pears. It really needs the pears to cut the richness of the tart. Other than using the food processor to make the shell and filling and using a few slices from one more pear, I thought the tart was delicious. Mine looked exactly like the photo. People loved it. Marlene's CuisineFoster City, CA10/3/2021Worst frangipani tart I have ever made.  And I have made many.  I did not try the tart shell recipe, so I can not comment on that. It's not that I just did not like it... the filling was dry and not edible.  Had to through the whole thing in the trash after trying a few bites of a slice.  Followed the filling instructions exactly and did not make any changes.  Baked for 40 minutes.  I went back and compared the ratios of almonds, sugar, butter, flour, eggs, and extracts to other recipes.  The ratios in this recipe are off, especially after adding the dry cocoa powder.  I'll go back to the tried and true recipes of Mary Berry and Maggie Beers.
