The third slice of pizza. The fourth helping of any potato product. Stacks from the library I\u2019ll never finish by due date. And on the weekend, I think it\u2019s relaxing and fun to take on four to seven cooking projects. Double that if people are coming over. By the time guests arrive for cocktails, all I want to do is sit down and never get up again.BECAUSE MY FEET HURT.Cooking all day\u2014and this is no surprise to any professional cook, nurse, or teacher\u2014puts a lot of weight on the ol\u2019 feet. Mine happen to be nearly flat. I have an array of slippers at home for various seasons, occasions, and suitors, but none of them offer sole support. I needed the clogs Carla wears. Carla clogs.Bon App\u00e9tit food director Carla Lalli Music is the inventor of a famous burger special sauce and the author of a fantastic cookbook, but she\u2019s one of my personal heroes for her choice in  shoes alone. Carla has fancy clogs and work clogs, and it\u2019s the work clogs I needed. She confirmed this when I asked her about them and all she said was: YOU NEED THEM, BEGGS!So I bought a pair of deep brown leather Danskos with a wooden sole for wearing to work. A year later I bought a summery pair in \u201cprofessional honey distressed\u201d (an eternal mood). But the best move was the white leather pair I got as a birthday gift, which my entire family knew I wanted (I talk about the gifts I want a lot\u2014it\u2019s subtle and effective). That\u2019s my cooking pair. I like their sanitary, Nurse Ratched vibe. I wear them on the weekend when I\u2019m making a fresh batch of chile crisp, boiling a pot of lentils, and waiting for the timer to go off on a butter-based cake. I might do some laundry or throw away things people I live with won\u2019t notice are missing. I get shit done in my Danskos.*Cue infomercial host voice.* Danskos support your sticks while you stand for hours. The design is intent on keeping your foot stable. Please note the anatomically contoured sole, the rounded and rock solid \u201creinforced toe box,\u201d and the \u201canti-fatigue rocker bottom.\u201d The design is purposefully, functionally ugly. It\u2019s an acquired look\u2014after a while they start to appear downright beautiful to the beholder. They can repel water and oil; the leather develops patina with age. They\u2019re heavy, sturdy shoes with an unusual fit (your heel is supposed to barely slip out of the back as you walk, it\u2019s almost loose-fitting), and therefore not for everyone. But for this flat-footed kitchen wench they\u2019re godsent. By the time the fire alarm stops yowling and the drinks are poured, I\u2019m ready to stand until I can\u2019t stand it anymore. But usually that\u2019s not until the third martini.Buy it: Dansko Professionals, $120All products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
