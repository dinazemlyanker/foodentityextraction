I have, on more than one occasion, actually squealed upon discovering it there, tucked behind a pint of ice cream and bag of green peas. This is because tteok is a fast track to comfort food, a ticket to a bowl of something satisfying no matter what direction you take it. Crispy and crunchy? Saucy and braise-y? Smothered with cheese? Tteok can do it all, and without it, my freezer feels incomplete.For more about the versatile ingredient, how it\u2019s made, and ideas for using it at home, read on:What is tteok?Featured in sweet and savory dishes alike, tteok\u2014or Korean rice cakes\u2014are made from rice that\u2019s steamed and pounded to create a distinctively chewy texture. Traditionally, the pounded mixture was rolled into long logs and cut into bite-size pieces, but now most commercially available tteok is extruded from a machine as long cylinders. Those cylinders are cut into chubby pieces, sliced thinly on a diagonal, or twisted into a cocoon shape that looks like two little balls stuck together.While tteok\u2019s varied shapes make them a fun addition to soups, stews, and stir-fries, it\u2019s the rice cakes\u2019 texture that sets them apart. \u201cIt\u2019s a specific chewiness that is different from anything else,\u201d says Jenny Kwak, chef and owner of Haenyeo in Brooklyn\u2019s Park Slope neighborhood. The elastic bounce that comes with every bite, even when the outside is crisped to a golden brown crunch, is what keeps people coming back for more.Tteok are right at home among the chicken, cabbage, and sweet potatoes in this dakgalbi.\nPhoto by Laura Murray, Food Styling by Micah MortonI\u2019m sold! Where can I get it?Tteok is available both fresh or frozen, though the fresh variety is more difficult to find. If you can source the rice cakes fresh (usually from a well-stocked Asian market), Susan Kim, the chef behind Doshi, says they have next-level sponginess and chew. \u201cIn Korea, there are fresh tteok stores, almost like bakeries. Whenever I go to visit my parents, I pick up fresh tteok; you don\u2019t even need to apply any heat, it\u2019s just like a piece of bread you eat fresh. But it\u2019s a perishable product in the sense that you should really enjoy it that day.\u201dFrozen tteok, on the other hand, is often sold in vacuum-sealed bags and will stay good for months in your freezer. This makes it a valuable kitchen staple, and one worth keeping on hand at all times. Do note, however, that \u201cmany months\u201d does not mean \u201cforever.\u201d Jennifer Kim, the chef at the now-closed Passerotto in the Andersonville neighborhood of Chicago, warns that if you keep tteok in the freezer for too long they can dry out and deteriorate. \u201cLook for feathering and cracks along the edges\u2014this means they\u2019ll break apart when cooked.\u201dHow should I cook it?While fresh tteok can be eaten out of hand with little to no preparation (Susan Kim likes the bouncy pieces simply dipped in a mixture of honey and soy), frozen tteok needs heat and liquid to bring it to its full chewiness potential. Depending on the way you plan to use your tteok and how long you have before you want to eat, prep can differ slightly, but it always hinges on rehydrating the individual pieces.Susan Kim likens the rehydrating process of frozen tteok to soaking beans in room temperature water overnight before boiling. \u201cAfter you soak it, it doesn\u2019t appear any different, it just looks like it's still submerged in water,\u201d she says. \u201cBut soaking tteok before using it does make a difference in terms of overall consistency and chewiness all the way to the core. Overnight if you can, half a day\u2014even just an hour will make a difference.\u201d From there, you need only drain and pat your tteok dry before tossing it into a hot pan with oil for crispy bites or directly into a sauce, soup, or stew to finish cooking.Thin rice cakes are ideal for stir-fries\u2014flatter surfaces = more crisping.\nPhotographs by Laura Murray, food styling by Susie TheodorouTo get each piece to a softer, more elastic place in less time, you can skip the long hydration period and boil your tteok in water directly from frozen. Cook times will differ based on the size and shape of your tteok, but in general, you\u2019ll boil them just until they float to the top of the pot like gnocchi, which should take about three minutes. While this process is much faster, what you make up for in efficiency you might lose in flavor: Taking the time to rehydrate the tteok and then \u201ccook\u201d it directly in the sauce or broth (rather than boiling it), gives each piece the opportunity to take on the flavor of the liquid surrounding it.According to Susan Kim, tteok\u2019s texture only improves the longer it spends in a sauce of stew, much like a braise that is better after it rests. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that the next day, the texture of the tteok changes in a way that I think is truly delicious. It will still be completely structurally intact, but the chewiness and the give of it changes. It\u2019s almost as if the rehydration process continues as it\u2019s submerged in the liquid.\u201dHow is tteok traditionally used?Tteok is added to soups, stews, and stir-fries, it\u2019s crisped up as a snack or side dish, and it\u2019s the star ingredient of tteokbokki, a spicy, saucy, simmered dish that\u2019s sometimes served with boiled eggs or fish cakes. Variations on the classic tteokbokki include gravy-style curry bases, soy and garlic versions without the gochujang and gochugaru, and the recently popular rose tteokbokki, in which cream turns the sauce pink.Along with tteok, this tteokbokki contains another freezer aisle delight: fish cakes!\nPhoto by Chelsie Craig, food styling by Kat BoytsovaTteok can also be made into sweet applications, especially for children. Kwak describes dessert versions as \u201csaut\u00e9ed in sesame oil and sprinkled with a little sugar\u2014it\u2019s crispy, chewy, and soft inside, and kids love it. Or you can cover it with honey, maple syrup, or a sweet red bean sauce.\u201dHow else can I cook with tteok?\u201cTteok is such an essential part of Korean food, but it can really be used whenever we think of an ingredient as a vehicle, in anything rice- or pasta-based,\u201d says Jennifer Kim. The \u201cmost popular dish on the menu by far\u201d at Passerotto was the tteok lamb ragu, a play on traditional tteokbokki that featured lamb necks braised in an Italian-style sauce and plenty of shaved cheese. Meaty pasta sauces, cheese sauces, and even pestos play well with tteok, which makes a useful pasta alternative because it\u2019s naturally gluten-free (though some store-bought varieties do contain wheat starch, so be sure to check the ingredients list). It\u2019s \u201cjust another reason why people [who didn\u2019t grow up with it] might start to cook tteok more often at home,\u201d Kwak says. Plus, she notes, \u201cAsian people like the chew in food. We\u2019re not so into things that melt in your mouth, that\u2019s a very Western thing. So the fact that tteok is a different texture to introduce to non-Korean dishes, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s what makes it interesting.\u201dTo play up a combination of textures\u2014namely, a crispy exterior and tender interior\u2014Kim recommends treating tteok like gnocchi, giving it \u201ca hard sear in a cast-iron pan so it gets a crust on the outside but stays really chewy on the inside\u201d before tossing it in sauce. Susan Kim employs a similar move in her Crispy Rice Cakes With Halloumi Cheese and Gochujang Brown Butter, a hit dish at her Doshi pop-ups, and one that also highlights the beloved pairing of tteok and cheese. \u201cHalloumi, like tteok, totally changes texture when you cook it. I liked that people wouldn\u2019t necessarily know if they were picking up a piece of crispy tteok or crispy cheese.\u201d\u00a0At Haenyeo, Kwak uses tteok in a Mexican application, with saucy and cheesy elements that mirror traditional Korean preparations but with a different flavor profile. The dish is a smoky, spicy fundido with chorizo, which gets a Korean twist from gochujang-spiked sauce and the chewy pieces of tteok hidden under the thick top layer of melted cheese. But in the world of tteok experimentation, she\u2019s open to pushing the chewy, chubby bites to the limits. \u201cYou can even toast it and wrap it in bacon!\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s an idea from a middle schooler, my friend\u2019s son, who\u2019s obsessed with tteok.\u201dThere\u2019s really no limit to what tteok can be once you have it in your kitchen and incorporate it into your cooking, Susan Kim agrees. \u201cI think it's one of those things that keeps evolving because the ingredient itself is so versatile.\u201dGet the recipe!Crispy Rice Cakes With Halloumi Cheese and Gochujang Brown ButterToasty griddled Korean rice cakes, melty cheese, and a spicy, nutty brown butter\u2013gochujang sauce come together in this truly decadent snack.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make.
