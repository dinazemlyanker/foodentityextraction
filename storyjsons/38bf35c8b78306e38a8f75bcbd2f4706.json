It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.Guess what I don\u2019t have in my Brooklyn kitchen? Air conditioning. Guess what I\u2019m not doing this weekend? Baking. Guess what\u2019s better than sweating over an all-butter dough in this humidity? Ice cream, that\u2019s what.You heard me. As long as your freezer can hold its own when indoor temperatures hit the mid-80s, ice cream is the ticket. That said (you knew that was coming, right?), we wouldn\u2019t be in this conversation if we didn\u2019t all like making exceptional things to eat. The desire to execute a recipe is irresistible, but making ice cream takes too long! Buy it, and embellish it! Now that ice cream flavors come with the toppings pre-mixed in, the only topping worth tackling is hot fudge.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!Lucky for us, Claire Saffitz figured out how to make hot fudge at home, and the results will eclipse anything you can scrape out of a jar. Hot fudge is more involved than chocolate sauce but less tricky than the walnut-topped confection your great-grandmother made. The key moment comes when you cook cream with brown sugar and agave until it hits 220\u00b0 on a thermometer, which will drive off the right amount of liquid and change the sugar\u2019s structure so that the mixture will be stretchy and chewy at room temperature. Once that magic moment has elapsed, you add unsweetened chopped chocolate and continue cooking until the mixture is thickened\u2014it only takes a minute but you have to stir diligently the entire time to prevent the chocolate from burning.Hot fudge would definitely be good on this caramel ice cream.\nMichael Graydon & Nikole HerriottOff heat, Claire stirs in cocoa, vanilla, and salt\u2014those ingredients are less sciency and more about seasoning the sauce so that it tastes robustly chocolatey and rich. Inevitably, as soon as you add the cocoa, the mixture will separate and look like a sludgy mud pile, but you didn\u2019t ruin it by mistake! Once you whisk in a little water, it will return to a shiny, supple state. (All of this is in the recipe, by the way.)I did an informal poll of hot fudge enthusiasts earlier today, and I knew I had the right focus group when one of them said that she \u201cgot a warm feeling just from hearing the words hot fudge.\u201d\u201cDo you like it when the fudge is hot and streaming over the ice cream, or cold and chewy at the bottom of the bowl?\u201d I asked.\u201cHot and flowy,\u201d replied Shirley*.\u201cCold and chewy,\u201d interjected Moe*.\u201cSomewhere in between,\u201d opined Marjorie*.Well, there you have it. Truly and officially, hot fudge is all things to all people, and the ultimate summer food.*Names have been changed.Get the recipe:BA's Best Hot FudgeView RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCarla NewsletterFudgeIce CreamSummerRead MorerestaurantsThe Hype Ice Cream I\u2019m Willing to Wait in Long, Near-Rioting Lines ForBy Sarah JampelcookingA Strawberry Dessert for People Who Can\u2019t BakeBy Carla Lalli MusiccultureOne of My Most Prized Possessions Is an Ice Cream Sandwich Brand's SwagBy Zo\u00eb SessumsLifestyleThis Frozen Greek Yogurt Blackout Pie Is Here to Dethrone Ice Cream CakeBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
