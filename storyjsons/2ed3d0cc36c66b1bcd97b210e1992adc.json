And we asked them to do it while filming Making Perfect, a six-part video series documenting every success and setback. Somehow, it all worked out...perfectly. Here\u2019s how the Mashed Potatoes With Crispety Cruncheties and Why-Is-It-So-Good Gravy came together.Find all of the recipes from the Absolutely, Positively Perfect Thanksgiving menu here.The Dream TeamCarla Lalli Music and Molly BazThe ChallengeDevelop a creamy mashed potato recipe that brings something new to the table\u2014and can be made ahead. The gravy should also be make-aheadable and shouldn\u2019t rely on turkey drippings or a roux.The SolutionThe potato texture is a credit to the right guy for the job: the German Butterball. Plus, roasting the potatoes first concentrates the flavor. The gravy\u2019s depth comes from roasted poultry bones and\u2014surprise!\u2014MSG.Watch Carla and Molly make the perfect mashed potatoes and gravy.\nRoast Your Potatoes Before MashingWant your mashed potatoes to taste like potatoes? Roasting them intensifies their earthy and malty qualities, and helps the flesh achieve a fluffy, moist texture. \u201cYou know, a Maillard reaction is happening in there,\u201d said Molly, celebrated potato scientist. Maillard, as in the chemical jamboree that happens when sugars in foods rearrange in the oven, causing browning. Boiling, which yields tender but relatively bland potatoes, just doesn\u2019t compare.Butterball or BustRick Bishop of Mountain Sweet Berry Farm led Carla and Molly in a taste test of 10 spud contenders. Then they boiled, roasted, and steamed the top three and mashed each of those. That\u2019s nine pots of mashed potatoes! But the pale golden yellow German Butterball won by a landslide (sorry, Yukon Gold). \u201cYou think of butter when you look at it,\u201d Carla said\u2014and it tastes buttery too. Its fine cell structure (that\u2019s right) means it gets fluffy when roasted and suuuper smooth when mashed.Isn\u2019t she perfect?\nPhoto by Alex LauInfuse, Can\u2019t LoseWe mash with a mixture of milk and butter infused with lemon, thyme, garlic, peppercorn, and salt, which adds more flavor but still lets the Butterballs shine.A Crispy Moment\u201cEverything on the Thanksgiving table is soft and floppy,\u201d Molly sighed. To bring some texture back to the meal, Carla and Molly added a crunchy topping inspired by patatas bravas: a mixture of breadcrumbs and potato chips spiced with garlic, paprika, lemon zest, thyme, and fresh parsley. We ate it like fiends during testing.Do It AheadThese are extra-velvety mashed potatoes with a light body (how would you describe your potato body?), so you might not need milk when you reheat them over medium-low. If you do, at it slowly and gradually.Get the recipe:Mashed Potatoes With Crispety CrunchetiesRidiculously, impossibly creamy mashed potatoes with a patatas bravas-inspired topping.View RecipeThe Great Gravy Technique: Beurre Mani\u00e9Beurre manie\u0301 is a mixture of soft butter and all-purpose flour and memories of a French class taken long ago. It thickens the gravy without the whole get-another-pan-out roux-tine.Wait, MSG Is the Secret?Monosodium glutamate is a naturally occurring amino acid found in many tasty foods (like Parmesan), and though the store-bought version is engineered, it has the same umami-to-the-max effect. Despite exaggerated fearmongering reports in the \u201970s, a sprinkle in your gravy is harmless, per the FDA.Flavor in a jar.\nPhoto by Alex LauTake StockHomemade turkey (or chicken) stock is necessary.
