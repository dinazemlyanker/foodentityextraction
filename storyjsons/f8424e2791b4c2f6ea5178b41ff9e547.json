The best part? Making them in an air fryer means you don't have to worry about a scary pot of bubbling oil, and clean up is a breeze. (Which is to say, get ready to have a whole lot more chicken tender action in your life.) You could certainly serve these with whatever dipping sauce you like, but trust us: That creamy-tangy peanut sauce makes the whole thing over-the-top delicious.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Step 3; I\u2019m spraying the bowl with the nonstick spray? The food? I\u2019ve never seen that before so I\u2019m a little flummoxed.Mauma-MiaDutchess, NY12/1/2021The recipe for the chicken is great, turned out so crispy and flavorful. Will definitely make again and serve on chicken or even a katsu style sandwich. The peanut sauce was very disappointing. I actually threw it out and made my go to peanut sauce recipe which paired great. Would recommend serving with some green onions and cucumbers on rice. BucatiniBimboTraverse City, MI10/10/2021This was OK cooked in a \u2018scary deep fat fryer' at 375*f  for 6 min each batch, .I expect it could better if I knew enough about  using the unit (with built in oil filtration and storage that I bought via link on these pages) unmodified a lot of the coating of seeds and coconut fell off in the deep fat fryer\u2026So,  how should the recipe be modified to correct for that in a proper fryer?WindyMidCoast Maine9/24/2021Turned out great, peanut could have used some soy sauce and green onions.  The amount of coconut and panko could have been cut in half, threw out a bunch.  Eggs where just the right amount.  More air fryer recipes like these please.JkdrummerAuburn, WA9/19/2021why cant the ingredients be divided into the different components for the dish.\nmakes it so easy to understand, and adapt if one wants to swap ingredients. Here one has to read the full list, read the whole recipe, and understand whats going where. Even the instructions can be made component wise. Its just so surprising you'll havent thought of it making this change.
