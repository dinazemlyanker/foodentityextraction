It gets better: If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll get this letter before everyone else.What the slush?I don\u2019t understand why more people aren\u2019t making this glorious personal air-conditioner of a beverage. I haven\u2019t seen even a single picture of the Healthyish Beauty-Food Mango Slushy in my Instagram feed, and yet I\u2019ve seen a thousand videos of people getting out moving cars doing the #kikidoyouloveme dance.The slushy is not only more entertaining, it\u2019s more rewarding.You don\u2019t even have to wait for the image to load to know there\u2019s genius at work. Enticement begins with the recipe name alone: Beauty-Food Mango Slushy. Sure, fine, whatever\u2014it\u2019s blended frozen fruit that you can drink, but don\u2019t you dare call it a \u201csmoothie\u201d. This is a slushy, and if you\u2019ve ever been tempted to buy a plastic sandal simply because someone labeled it a Jelly, you know how important branding can be.Want this letter before it hits the website? Sign up for our newsletter!A slushy, despite (or maybe because of) its subliminal associations with 7-Eleven Slurpees, sounds freaking incredible. It sounds special. A slushy is, in fact, colder than a smoothie (I just decided). Remember the Polar Vortex winter of 2015, when the Atlantic ocean got so cold that the waves started to freeze? That\u2019s what this is like, except the ingredients are straight out of the tropical zone: Frozen mango, lean and hydrating coconut water, zippy lime juice, a big pinch of salt, and a non-ignorable amount of crushed red pepper flakes. Molly Baz, who created this concoction, took the legendary combination of fresh mango with Taj\u00edn and lime juice and slushified it. You\u2019re welcome! (Thanks, Molly.)Back to the genius marketing though: \u201cBeauty-Food Mango Slushy.\u201d Beauty food! Now that you mention it, that vibrant orange is quite a fetching color! You mean the slushy has vitamins A and C to make me more beautiful! As if! What the heck\u2014make mine a double!Smoothies are for children. They always have bananas, and you blend them till they\u2019re frothy, and then you stick a biodegradable straw in them and hope your kid doesn\u2019t taste the cup of rolled oats you added for nutrition. It\u2019s called survival.Alternatively, a slushy made with frozen mango whips up into a dense, crystallized, silky, semi-frozen state, and instead of the straw there\u2019s a smattering of chile flakes. It\u2019s grown-up stuff, and if you added a few ounces of rum\u2014well, that would be beautiful too.If I had half a brain, I would be subsisting on these exclusively. Instead I have been enduring late-afternoon tastings of the entire Thanksgiving menu in the test kitchen for the past two weeks, as the New York City heat and humidity wreaks havoc on my attitude and my naturally curly hair. I\u2019m a special kind of cranky that only a very photogenic slushy can fix. See you at the swim-up bar.Get the recipe:Beauty-Food Mango SlushyMangoes are packed with vitamins C and A, both of which provide major skin-brightening benefits. Lime and chile keep this slushy spicy and bright.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titMangoCarla NewsletterRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
