And why shouldn\u2019t they be? These people invented pizza.By Carla CicconeMay 7, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailFacebookTwitterEmailLike many Italians, I was raised to love good food and tell stories about it.Here\u2019s one.My nonna, dad, and aunt crossed the Atlantic on a boat from Italy in 1953. Dad was four and my aunt was six. They ate well on that journey: pasta, minestrone, eggs, and bread that was crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. When they docked in Halifax, Nova Scotia, an attendant handed my aunt a sandwich\u2014a slippery slice of ham between two pieces of mushy white bread. She started crying. \u201cIt\u2019s cake!\u201d she sobbed, knowing on some level that the culinary standards she had enjoyed so far had been left behind on the boat she stepped off of.In fact, many Italians who immigrated to Canada around that time started calling the locals mangia cakes, meaning \u201ccake eaters,\u201d because whenever they pulled out their lunches, there it was: soft, perfectly shaped white bread that looked, to those whose bread was brown and crunchy on the outside, like dessert. Since before Italy was a nation, Italians have been mad at food that is not good or at least not their particular region, city, or hamlet\u2019s version of good, and I hope they stay that way forever.Italians are also exceedingly proud of their culinary traditions. And why shouldn\u2019t they be? These people invented pizza. Thanks to the internet, Italians are quickly discovering what North Americans\u2014namely food content creators like Tasty and Tastemade (and yes, even Bon App\u00e9tit)\u2014 are doing to their beloved dishes, and they\u2019re not happy about it.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.A magnificent and highly entertaining Twitter account called Italians Mad At Food is documenting the best of Italians commenting on abominations of their national cuisine. These are emotional, over-the-top reactions generally written in Google-translated English or just shoddy regular English because internet comments. They\u2019re usually along the lines of \u201cYOUR \u2018PASTA\u2019 BELONGS IN THE GARBAGE ALONG WITH YOUR PRESIDENT.\u201d These people are way too dramatic and need to calm down because it\u2019s only food, and I am absolutely one of them.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.This may seem excessive, but trust, it\u2019s warranted. I cannot stress enough how much better Italians are at food than the rest of us. I once met a two-year-old in Italy who knew more about food than I, a grown woman, do. Her name was Laura and she cut up crespelle all by herself, told me its ingredients, and delicately ate her pieces with a fork, adding that she\u2019d like a side of verdure, per favore (\u201cgreens, please\u201d). Of course, little Laura didn\u2019t get this way on her own. She reminded me of a scene from the show Jamie\u2019s Great Italian Escape, in which Jamie Oliver attempts to make pasta by hand, fails, and gets schooled by a six-year-old who is much better than he is (start at 13:13). Like most Italians in Italy, these kids are taught from birth that food is life and life is food, to always treat food like your favorite dinner guest and get really mad about it when it\u2019s not perfect.Italians are the Kanye Wests of food, basically.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.You might be thinking, Why do these crazy people care about this food on the internet if they don\u2019t have to eat it? Valid point, but to be Italian is to be nosy, stubborn, and insanely judgmental when it comes to all kitchen matters. Disrespecting their food is like disrespecting their mothers and grandmothers and ancestors. They must rage-watch these videos and tell you why they shouldn\u2019t exist. Does this mean that North Americans are lazy, cultureless hacks who wouldn\u2019t know good food if it hit them in the face? Not entirely, but because Americans generally haven\u2019t been exposed to this level of food fanaticism and perfection, and what\u2019s available on this continent is blander, junkier, saltier, and uglier, it can be hard to comprehend why Italians care so much about food.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.To them, watching Americans make terrible versions of their food and calling it Italian is like looking at the Ecce Homo painting after that woman in Spain attempted to restore it and calling it great art. They grimace, they gasp, they get full-body cringes. So they\u2019ve taken to scolding us like children who have been very bad and need to learn a thing or two.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.When people try, in the comments and in life, to defend things like one-pot-pasta, in which a dry pasta like fettuccine is placed in a pot containing an unfathomable mix of chicken broth and milk before it is even boiling, they\u2019re not only making themselves look sad, they\u2019re actually hurting Italian people.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.According to Italians Mad At Food, there are an extraordinary amount of Italians mad about what is being done to pasta, specifically, and I am here for it.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Even when it\u2019s not made in one pot or boiled in milk, pasta is constantly disrespected in North America. I\u2019ve been lying to people about their pasta for my entire life. There usually comes a time in my friendships when one will say, \u201cyou\u2019ll love the food at this new restaurant, it\u2019s authentic Italian,\u201d or \u201cLogan makes the best pasta sauce, you have to try it.\u201d I\u2019ll try it, and I\u2019ll lie about it and tell you it\u2019s good. Never, ever think you can impress an Italian with your version of Italian food.Twitter contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Italians, renowned for overabundant passion and enthusiasm, know the one place not to overdo it is in the kitchen. Less is more, and simplicity is one of the reasons why food tastes better in Italy than it does anywhere else. Their sauce is always kept simple, which is something that is often lost in translation in North American kitchens. The idea is that if your ingredients are the freshest and the best, you don\u2019t need a lot of them to make the sauce sing. A little onion, some strained San Marzano tomatoes, a bit of salt, pepper, and basil and basta. The order of ingredients is also important, which is one reason this Bon App\u00e9tit video recipe for Pietro\u2019s chicken Parmesan got more than a few Italians riled up. No one attempting Italian cuisine is immune to their wrath.Fettuccine Alfredo is a hot-button food item for the IMAF. Is it Italian because it was invented by an Italian named Alfredo?
