Then wait a lifetime to receive food that was, at best, mediocre? Today, it\u2019s not enough to settle for tepid takeout and delivery. We want fresh! Organic! Variety! Give me whole foods or give me death! We deserve more.Thankfully, the great minds at Caviar understand the plight of ordering in across America\u2014and they\u2019ve partnered with Healthyish-recommended restaurants to satisfy far-flung cravings with fresh, globally inspired dishes. So whether you\u2019re road-tripping, traveling for work, or live in a food mecca like Chicago, D.C., L.A., Manhattan, or San Francisco, next time you\u2019re up for some exceptional ordering in, go fresh and global from one of these restaurants.Get Your Asian-Inspired Fix From Coast to CoastTakorean, D.C.CaviarWhat\u2019s not to love about hybrid cuisine? That\u2019s the sentiment at TaKorean in D.C., where Korean tacos are crafted from scratch with bold and bright (read: healthful!) ingredients. Think Bulgogi on a soft corn tortilla, topped with kimchi, lime crema, and sesame seeds. Not to be outdone in The District, however, CHIKO rises to the occasion with a modern marriage between Korean and Chinese flavors. Caviar favorites include Orange-ish Chicken and Pork and Kimchi Potstickers. Yes, please, thank you.In Chicago, Asian flavors take a slightly different turn at Urbanbelly, where chef Bill Kim relishes in unpredictable dumpling combos like sweet potato and maple, but also serves up cross-continent favorites like pho, ramen, and bibimbap. At honeygrow, stir-fries go mainstream with six specially curated combos and build-your-own options featuring crossover ingredients like freshly made whole-wheat noodles, all-natural roast chicken, sesame garlic, coconut curry, and lemon miso tahini.If you\u2019re still dreaming of your last trip to Thailand (or the one you\u2019ll take someday), you\u2019ll love the Thai street food options at Night + Market, where chef Kris Yenbamroong serves celebs and civilians alike his authentic and unique Thai combos. Sure, you could order a slam-up Pad Thai, but when Pork Toro\u2014grilled fatty pig neck with chili dip\u2014is on the menu, we suggest throwing caution to the wind.Pretend You\u2019re on the Mediterranean Coast with These Fresh Middle Eastern PicksDune, Los AngelesCaviarThe pita sandwich is having a moment. Perhaps because of its easy-to-carry nature, or its ability to host a variety of ingredients. Whatever the reason, we\u2019re grateful. In San Francisco, Souvla fills fluffy pitas with naturally raised meats (though there are bright and beautiful salads, too), inspired by traditional Greek souvlaki joints.Down south in L.A., Dune is on their way to dominating the sandwich game with their not-so-tiny house-baked flat breads stuffed and overflowing with everything from pasture-raised lamb to pickled beets. Only a few miles away, chef Josef Centeno keeps handheld deliciousness alive at B\u00e4coShop, where he pulls inspiration from all over the globe to produce his signature b\u00e4cos: fresh, homemade flatbread folded over grilled meats, veggies, and sauces with aromatic spices.There\u2019s no denying that California is king when it comes to fresh, no-fuss food to go, but that\u2019s not to say New York City is lacking. At Jack\u2019s Wife Freda, where an eclectic menu reflects the influence of South African and Israeli cuisine, healthy options abound\u2014or not. Maya\u2019s Breakfast Bowl mixes eggs with red quinoa, kale, and spaghetti squash, while Jack\u2019s Burger goes all-in with grilled tomato and fried onion. It\u2019s all good, no matter how you slice it.The Freshest Evolution of On-The-Go American CuisineFarmbird, D.C.CaviarThanks be to wellness trends for popularizing the protein and vegetable plate, a favored menu item by those of us eschewing less healthy on-the-go options. At RT Rotisserie in San Francisco, chefs-owners Evan and Sarah Rich\u2014who you may know from their buzzed-about restaurant, Rich Table\u2014see to it that you can get a good ole half or whole chicken made with free-range Rocky birds from Petaluma and a side of seared broccoli with chimichurri. Or you could opt for the less wholesome (but equally delicious) Sally Hurricane\u2019s Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich with charred cabbage, pickled onions, and chipotle yogurt on a brioche bun.The chicken trail continues in D.C. at Farmbird, where everything is prepared from scratch, and birds are humanely raised on an all-veggie diet without growth hormones or antibiotics. From sandwich to salad, you\u2019re guaranteed grilled chicken with an inventive twist. Thanks to spots like Left Coast in Chicago, healthful eating is always exciting with bowls, salads, grains, and wraps carefully crafted to ignite taste buds and change the perception that good-for-you-foods are boring. Here, they\u2019re anything but.Over in Manhattan\u2014a place that prides itself on having figured out nearly everything\u2014the proteins, veggies, and beautifully tossed salads monopolize the menu at Dig Inn, where mindful sourcing comes first and farm-fresh ingredients reign supreme. For an all-out dose of feel-good food, look no further than Blake Lane. \u00a0This Upper East Side joint turns out gorgeous bowls, sandwiches, and entr\u00e9es that are organic and local when possible, and largely vegan and gluten-free, though fresh tuna poke, wild cod tacos, and grass-fed hanger steaks are available for pescatarians and carnivores. With the eat-fresh movement and a welcome global influence, delivery has never looked better than it does today.Caviar is an easy way to order meals from the best local restaurants across the U.S. Customers can order food for pickup or delivery ahead on the web, or instantly from Caviar\u2019s free mobile app for iOS and Android.Explore Bon App\u00e9titSuperpoweredRecipes you want to make.
