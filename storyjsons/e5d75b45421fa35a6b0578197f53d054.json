A colorful gang of cherry tomatoes and dramatic heirlooms are mixed with zhuzhed-up pita chips, salty feta, and lots of herbs. So elegant! So fancy! And, shh, don\u2019t tell the tomatoes, but the real star is the za\u2019atar dressing: Toasty, earthy, and tangy, it\u2019d be welcome on seared zucchini, slow-roasted fish, or corn on the cob. Remember that just because it\u2019s an heirloom doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll taste great\u2014your picks should smell incredibly tomato-y and feel heavy for their size\u2014that means they're juicy.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

(or more) honey3\u00bdoz. Greek feta\u00bdcup basil leaves\u00bdcup mint leavesPreparationStep 1Using a paring knife, core 1\u00bd lb. heirloom tomatoes, then cut each into 8\u201312 wedges, depending on their size, using a very sharp chef knife or serrated knife (if your chef knife is dull, it's going to squish your precious tomatoes). Halve or quarter 12 oz. mixed cherry tomatoes (cutting them through their equators will reveal more seeds and make them even prettier).\u2192  If you care about tomatoes, you need this little knifePlay/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 2Transfer tomatoes to a large bowl; season with 1\u00bc tsp. salt. That salt is going to draw out moisture from the tomatoes, which will intensify their flavor. Stir to gently combine (be careful with those delicate tomatoes!); set aside.Step 3Zest \u00bc lemon\u2014you want about \u00bd tsp. zest (it\u2019s easiest to measure if you hold the Microplane upside down so that the zest collects on top and you can scoop it into the measuring spoon). Grate \u00bd garlic clove. Set aside.Step 4Heat 6 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a small saucepan or skillet over medium until just starting to shimmer, about 2 minutes. Add 2 Tbsp. za\u2019atar and cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and darker in color, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in reserved lemon zest and garlic. Wait 10 seconds, then remove from heat. (You're looking to cook off the raw flavor of the garlic without losing the brightness of the lemon.) Transfer za\u2019atar oil to a heatproof measuring cup.Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 5Place 2 cups pita chips in a medium bowl. (Yes, you could make pita chips yourself\u2014but why turn on the oven in July? We're opting to spiff up store-bought chips instead.) Pour 2 Tbsp. za\u2019atar oil over; season with salt. Mix well with a rubber spatula, aiming to coat chips without breaking them into too many pieces.Step 6You should have about \u00bc cup za\u2019atar oil remaining. Squeeze 2 Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. lemon juice (from about 1/2 lemon) into a small bowl. Add 1\u00bd tsp. honey and \u00bd tsp. salt. Add za'atar oil, stirring constantly, until emulsified (meaning that you don\u2019t see any beads of separated oil). Taste dressing and add more lemon, honey, or salt if needed.Step 7Slice 3\u00bd oz. feta into thin planks (we like Greek feta because it's easy to crumble, with a pleasant tang), then add to bowl with reserved tomatoes. Tear any large \u00bd cup basil leaves and \u00bd cup mint leaves (if you have shears, you can cut them to avoid bruising and browning!) and add to bowl. Drizzle about 3 Tbsp. dressing over and toss to gently combine (your tomatoes are precious, delicate gems).Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevronStep 8Add pita chips to bowl (don\u2019t leave leftover oil behind\u2014scrape that in too) and fold gently to combine. Spoon salad onto platter, making sure to leave no juices behind.

Brought it to a neighborhood potluck and it was a bit.AnonymousMinneapolis, MN9/2/2021My household of finicky eaters approves this salad.  AnonymousLouisville, KY8/4/2020I made a large quantity of this salad for a crowd, and it was a hit! For fellow non-Americans who don't have access to Stacy's pita chips, I just cut some pita bread into squares, tossed through some olive oil, and put them in the oven for about 10 minutes at 200C (stirring halfway so the edges didn't burn). No need to season at this stage, as the za'atar dressing and salt added later do the trick. \nI prepared the salad ahead of time, but cut the tomatoes on the day and stirred the ingredients together just before serving. The dressing stored well in a jar and tasted perfect the following day. hannah_nMelbourne Australia2/27/2020so so good! i snuck in a few castleveltrano olives and a kirby. will definitely make this again as long as peak tomatoes last. YUM.marcylaneWoodbury, CT9/2/2019I made this twice: once for a friend who is allergic to sesame so I skipped the step of heating the oil with the zaatar and just made a dressing without the zaatar. It was delicious both times but I honestly couldn't find much of a difference, so if you don't want to turn on anything in your kitchen, I would skip that step. bengelsMontreal8/19/2019This was both fancy and beautiful, and the perfect way to use farmers' market tomatoes. I will absolutely make it again!alizaraeNew York 8/5/2019Excellent salad, bursting with beautiful tomato flavor and offset with the warmth of the za'atar and the crunchiness of the pita chips. STRONG RECOMMEND. Sarah ShiNew York7/27/2019This was a really delicious and easy tomato salad. The only change I made was using a whole garlic clove instead of half. I brought this to a dinner party and everyone enjoyed it and asked for the recipe.AnonymousColumbus, Ohio7/27/2019Explore Bon App\u00e9titSaladMediterraneanCherry TomatoTomatoVegetableZa'atarHerbs & SpicesFetaCheeseHeirloom TomatoSummerQuickEasyWeeknight MealsSideVegetarianLunchDinnerBasicallyRecipes you want to make.
