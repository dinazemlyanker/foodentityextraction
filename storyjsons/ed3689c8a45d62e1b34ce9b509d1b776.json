Dining at Chez Rach\u00e9\u2019s is a minor defense against major grief.By Rachel KhongApril 13, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Rachel KhongFacebookTwitterEmailIt\u2019s a time of minor disappointments that we don\u2019t feel right feeling, because they don\u2019t compare to the vastness and ubiquity of the world\u2019s suffering. My husband, Eli, had a trip to France scheduled for the end of March. When it became clear that he couldn\u2019t go, we joked that I could cook a French meal for him as consolation. My own minor disappointment was that I\u2019d been looking forward to going to a writers\u2019 residency for the month of April\u2014one of those residencies where I would be cooked for\u2014and it was canceled. We joked that, instead, I could shut myself in the bedroom, and Eli could leave picnic basket lunches at the door.I took my French meal assignment seriously. I emailed a Google calendar invite for 7:15 p.m. on a Wednesday. (He RSVP\u2019d yes.) I considered the ingredients we had on hand: a frozen package of beef stew meat; carrots and cardoons that had come in our farm box. His trip was supposed to have taken him to Lille, in Northern France, where a Belgian beef-and-beer stew called carbonnade flamande is popular. I could roughly approximate it if I swapped in our last two cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon for Belgian ale.I painted, in watercolor, a menu for Chez Rach\u00e9\u2019s (which I realized, after the fact, should have correctly been \u201cChez Rach\u00e9,\u201d but didn\u2019t have the energy to repaint). And on the night of, I lit candles and played music: \u201cLa Vie En Rose\u201d and Spotify\u2019s \u201cFrench Bistro\u201d playlist. Making his way over from the bedroom to the kitchen, Eli wore a coat jacket, button-down shirt, and wingtip shoes. (He immediately shed the jacket because: comfort.) We clinked our wine glasses together. Dessert was \u201cpepites de chocolate,\u201d which Google Translate told me meant \u201cchocolate chips.\u201d I presented them in a glass dish.What\u2019s good about restaurants is what\u2019s always been good about them: They\u2019re a venue for the willing suspension of disbelief from life, which is always, even under normal circumstances, a far cry from perfect. The best restaurants are transporting\u2014they take us to a place where someone else has made decisions with our happiness in mind. They provide respite, however illusory, and feed us, too. Or, at least, they did, before this pandemic. Before our governments mandated we no longer dine out.By now, you\u2019ve likely read about\u2014or experienced yourself\u2014the many cruel things that COVID-19 does to the human body. That it can take from us two senses\u2014taste and smell\u2014which happen to be crucial to the enjoyment of eating. It\u2019s a virus that robs us of pleasure, and some of us of life itself.Since shelter-in-place began, I keep thinking back to all the times I\u2019ve been sick and, in the throes of miserable illness, regretted that I\u2019d been taking my healthy days for granted. The privileges I\u2019d presumed were givens are now glaringly obvious: the ease of shopping for food, the access to innumerable ingredients, the pleasure of dining out. This period has been the rare opportunity to not overlook what\u2019s good: that, for the moment, I am healthy. I can taste food. I am alive.Lately I\u2019ve been wondering if not allowing ourselves to feel our minor sadnesses is its own heartbreak amid this global one. That this big collective grief has been a blunting force, erasing lesser griefs, erasing joy, and erasing the hope that might ultimately help us create a better world at the end of all this, a world that takes nothing and no one for granted.So I\u2019d recommend, if it sounds fun and possible to you, opening your own pretend restaurant for a night. It\u2019s not exactly escapism; escape isn\u2019t really possible. But it can be a joyful-sad reminder of what we\u2019ve been taking for granted, and what we still have.The restaurants I\u2019m planning in the weeks to come include Halal Gal, which will serve Halal cart\u2013style chicken over rice with a squeeze bottle of creamy white sauce; Rachiehana\u2019s, where the chef will attempt an onion volcano and to flick a shrimp into the sole diner\u2019s open mouth; Trattoria Khongo, where the pasta will come in gigantic, un-Italian portions, and house wine will be served by the carafe. It\u2019s a minor defense against our minor disappointments, and major grief. It\u2019s fortification to go on living, however life will look, even if\u2014especially if\u2014we don\u2019t yet know.Explore Bon App\u00e9titCoronavirusRecipes you want to make.
