Beautiful and satisfying, the combination of wrinkled kaiser roll, bouncy eggs, and congealed cheese seemed best left alone. Why mess with something that had never wronged me, never let me (or my hangover) down?But when my editor Amanda Shapiro wondered what a healthier breakfast sandwich would even look like, I couldn\u2019t stop trying to figure it out. And then came the breakfast sandwich from the L.A.-inspired all-day caf\u00e9 west~bourne in Soho. In place of mayo or cheese, it had shallot-infused labneh. In place of meat, it had a layer of deep-fried pickled onions that gave the sandwich its much-needed dose of umami. Which made me think, what if the onion was the meat?So I cut fat rings of red onion, coated them with soy sauce and garlic powder, and roasted them until they were jammy-crispy-leathery (in a good way). Using a red onion is key because it\u2019s sweeter than other varieties and therefore better suited to caramelizing into thick bacon-ish rings that are charred on the outside and buttery on the inside. This onion \u201cbacon\u201d is good enough to eat on its own and special enough to make the rest of the sandwich\u2014creamy scrambled eggs with big folds and sharp cheddar cheese\u2014more than just stuff on toast.The bread question still bugged me though. West~bourne\u2019s sandwich comes on an oversized English muffin, breaking free of the squishy deli bun paradigm, but I was intent on having something with whole grains. I found a gem in the freezer section of my local food co-op: Food for Life\u2019s 7-sprouted grain English muffins. Dense, nutty, chewy, immensely satisfying, and unmistakably healthy, it\u2019s the kind of English muffin I used to watch my parents eat with the scandalized expression of a child who prefers bread simple and white.That left just a few remaining details. As Andy Baraghani pointed out early on in the development process, if I was going to make a healthy breakfast sandwich, I better include something green. So I took some green Cholula and, mixed in chopped basil. Et voil\u00e0: a hot sauce that\u2019s cleansing and vegetal rather than just hot and salty.And since breakfast sandwiches are most critical on sleepy-eyed Sundays and frantic weekdays, I knew I needed to make it simple too. The onion bacon clocks in at about 40 minutes (about 35 minutes too long for any morning, no matter how leisurely), but\u2014here\u2019s the kicker\u2014you can make it a week in advance. Since you don\u2019t even have to reheat the onions before you assemble the sandwich, all that\u2019s left to do is scramble eggs, slice cheese, and toast the English muffin\u2014totally doable for a Wednesday and less time-consuming than walking to the bodega and fishing a five-dollar bill out of your bag. If that\u2019s not a healthy (or healthier) start to the morning, I don\u2019t know what is.It's the most important meal of the day:Healthyish Breakfast SandwichesYou may not mistake these jammy-crisp, slow-cooked onions for bacon, but they are truly exceptional as a stand-in.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishBreakfastScrambled EggsSandwichRead MoreLifestyleRejoice!
