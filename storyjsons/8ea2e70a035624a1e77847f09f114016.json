Now it\u2019s a booming business with plans to expand.By Micah Idris Harrigan, as told to Adam EraceAugust 19, 2020FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by A Brilliant Dummy / Tiayrra BradleyFacebookTwitterEmailMicah Idris Harrigan is the prince of the muggy South Philly summer. The 10-year-old entrepreneur sells cold cups of homemade lemonade\u2014five flavors, plus a weekly special\u2014at his pop-up stand, Micah\u2019s Mixx, which draws both social media fans and random passersby seeking a way station when the city\u2019s concrete sidewalks are hot as pizza stones. Sure, lots of kids put up lemonade stands, but Micah\u2019s Mixx isn\u2019t some cutesy piggy bank project; Harrigan has an LLC, branded merch, and his own debit card for expenses, thank you very much. Here, the bottled-beverage tycoon-in-training explains how he got his start and what the future might hold. \u2014Adam EraceLemonade is my backup plan. My dream job is to be a soccer player, but my mom was like, \u201cBefore you start all that, you need a plan B,\u201d and that\u2019s how I came up with the idea for Micah\u2019s Mixx around a year and a half ago. I just love lemonade because it\u2019s one of the only foods or drinks that doesn\u2019t have a ton of ingredients in it. I\u2019m picky so I like simple stuff that tastes good. My business combines my love for lemonade and my love for helping people. Hard times are happening due to coronavirus, and lemonade can make people happy and refreshed.We used to make the lemonade at home. My mom ordered a bunch of ingredients, and we set up her old bartending stand with a handwritten sign outside our house. We have five flavors: classic lemon, strawberry, blue raspberry, watermelon, and peach. We also have special editions every day, like cherry-lime, lavender, and mango. We sell it for $3 for a bottle, or two for $5.At first we sold out (my family and mom\u2019s friends always bought it), but it got cold so we didn\u2019t do many stands. Then COVID-19 came, and we had to wait a couple more months before we could start up again. This summer we started doing more pop-ups and collaborations around Philadelphia. The first was with Rally Coffee, and it was the most lemonade we ever sold: 150 bottles in less than an hour. A lot of people have gotten to know me because of these pop-ups. Social media has also helped. It\u2019s been a chain reaction: We went from 137 followers to 800 followers in less than a week, and today we\u2019re at 3,800. Now we have a kitchen that we work out of. It was taking over my mom\u2019s kitchen.Micah's Mixx, up close\nPhoto by A Brilliant Dummy / Tiayrra BradleyMost businesses don\u2019t start out like that. A lot of people in my neighborhood are saying it\u2019s good to have Black businesses going up, because in old times, Black people didn\u2019t have as many chances as white people to do something. So you see a Black kid starting his own business, and he\u2019s becoming really popular. That seems good to everyone.It feels awesome that I have achieved something in my life at a very young age. I\u2019m inspired by other businesses: Amazon, Microsoft, Walmart, Target, and video game companies. I like video games. We work every day\u2014one day we\u2019re preparing the lemonade, one day we\u2019re selling\u2014but we take breaks and I\u2019ll play Roblox or Minecraft. I don\u2019t really play Fortnite anymore. Too much drama with the players online.Micah\u2019s Mixx wouldn\u2019t be possible without my mom. Working with her is the best. She has two jobs, second-grade teacher and bartender\u2014she can cut a box of fruit in seconds! Teaching is to pay for house expenses, and bartending is to pay for the things that we do for fun. My mom taught me to work for what you need. We have been best friends my whole life, and I love her. She is my partner in business, and always will be.The man behind the lemonade stand\nPhoto by A Brilliant Dummy / Tiayrra BradleyShe\u2019s the money person. She won\u2019t even let me buy an Oculus Rift! She\u2019s saving the money for me to go to college, but I would also like to save up to go back on the same four-day cruise to the Bahamas I went on for my ninth birthday. The food was amazing, especially their chicken noodle soup. I would get it every night for dinner, even though it was 100 degrees outside. It was really nice to get to see a lot of new places from my culture, because in the Caribbean there seemed to be a lot of Black people.We\u2019re also saving for a trailer to sell our lemonade on the road. My mom told me it\u2019s better to go to different places so more people know you. If we just stayed in South Philly the whole time, we\u2019d only get the same customers. In a couple of years, I think I might have a storefront, maybe two if we\u2019re lucky. We would sell out of restaurants, we would have advertisements, and have a lot of other businesses as our friends.School\u2019s online next year, so I\u2019ll do my work and then make lemonade, I guess. I\u2019m transferring to a performing arts school. I sing. I can dance too. And act. Soccer, singing, dancing, acting, lemonade. I\u2019m a penta-threat.Explore Bon App\u00e9titPhiladelphiaFirst PersonRead MorecookingThe Lemoniest Lemonade Recipe Tastes Like Liquid SunshineBy Amiel StanekRecipes you want to make.
