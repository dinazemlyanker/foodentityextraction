Each of the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen editors will be sharing their top 10 cooking rules: the techniques they swear by, the ingredients they can\u2019t live without, and the mindsets that keep them going. This week: the senior food editor who loves salt just as much as she loves Tuna (her pup!), Molly Baz.1. Three words: mise en placeGetting your sh*t together before you start cooking is the ultimate way to set yourself up for smooth sailing. One of the main reasons that home cooks struggle in the kitchen is lack of organization\u2014not knowing when to start prepping, when to start cooking, what they can be doing in the downtime. Learning to get all of that stuff out of the way before you dive allows you to actually think about what you're doing. It\u2019s important to clear your head.2. Resist the urge to constantly stir/fiddle/peek at your foodIf you\u2019re going for browning, undisturbed contact with the pan is imperative.  Whether it\u2019s sausage, Brussels sprouts, or a pork chop, give it time to sit over the heat.3. Desserts need salt just as much as savory food doesI\u2019m not talking about salty-sweet desserts, those that lean into salt as their flavor profile. It\u2019s just that in order for a dessert to really taste like itself, there has to be at least a small amount of salt in there.4. Good kitchen feng shui is essential to enjoying cooking.I spend a lot of time in my kitchen thinking about where everything should be so that it\u2019s optimized for graceful cooking, which makes it that much more enjoyable and not so choppy. Even if you can\u2019t completely re-construct your kitchen, you can think about what drawers you\u2019re putting things in, what you\u2019re most likely to reach for when you\u2019re at the stove vs. at the counter. Set yourself up that way. If your flow isn\u2019t right, you\u2019ll never want to cook.Buy these guys in bulk.\n5. Kitchen towels are the best pot holdersI hate the wonky mitts. I don\u2019t know who invented them, but they\u2019re just unnecessary. Kitchen towels that are folded properly (and not damp!) are the perfect insulator, that then also double as a surface cleaner.6. Cook a recipe more than onceEven as I cook through my own recipes over and over again, they get better and better. If you come back to a recipe, you\u2019ll feel a certain level of comfort with it already so you\u2019ll be able to pay attention to things you weren\u2019t able to pay attention to before.7. When following recipes, cook to the indicator, not to the time frameEverybody\u2019s kitchen is different. Everybody\u2019s stove is different. Everybody\u2019s oven is different. We do a lot of testing in the Test Kitchen to provide time frames for everything you're doing in a recipe, so we\u2019ll say \u201ccaramelize the onions for 25-30 minutes.\u201d But the fact of the matter is, there\u2019s no way for us to predict exactly what\u2019s happening in your kitchen. So after that instruction there will be a comma and then it will say something like \u201cor until deeply golden brown and starting to turn black at the edges.\u201d That's the real indicator that you need to pay attention to in a recipe. The time doesn\u2019t matter as much.A little green goes a long way on Molly\u2019s beef and bacon stew.\n8. You eat with your eyesAlways think about how your dish is going to look on your plate. The more beautiful it is, the more delicious it is going to taste. I\u2019m not saying you need to be busting out tweezers and little squeeze bottles, but just be mindful of your plating. Think about what dish you\u2019re serving something on and how much negative space there is. Are you putting a nice fresh tumble of herbs on top because you made a beef stew? That kind of thing excites your palate.9. An oven thermometer is one of the most essential kitchen toolsEven if you set your oven to 325\u00b0, there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019s running at 375\u00b0 or even 275\u00b0, which can make or break a recipe. It\u2019s important to know what the hot spots of your oven are, too. So get a thermometer and get to know your oven.10. Salt is the number one reason your food doesn\u2019t taste as good at home as it does in a restaurantI think that most home cooks are scared of over-seasoning. Actually, it\u2019s important to over-season your food (at least once) to understand where that threshold is. It\u2019s often possible that you follow a recipe, and there are so many elements, but you walk away feeling like it doesn\u2019t taste as good as it should. It\u2019s likely that you just need to add a little bit of salt.Listen to the full discussion on the BA Foodcast:ContentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Explore Bon App\u00e9titTest KitchenRead MorecookingThis Spicy Cashew Dressing Is Scientifically Proven* to Make You Eat More SaladBy Aliza AbarbanelcultureAdmit It: You Love MuffinsBy Alex BeggscookingThis Grilled Chicken Sandwich Is Definitely Not BoringBy Adam RapoportcookingThe Most Opinionated Editors Came Together to Make BA\u2019s Best Matzo Ball SoupBy Emily SchultzRecipes you want to make.
