Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,Happy belated MLK Day. I really needed Rachel Cargyl\u2019s reminder, and maybe you do too: \u201cThe action...the work...it isn\u2019t in simply following educators, double tapping activists\u2019 posts, or commenting that you hear us. The work is in the the every day, on the ground, in your heart, with your voice, in your homes, with your vote, on your campuses, off the screen and in the streets.\u201dI went to Chicago for the long weekend, though it turned into a shorter weekend than planned thanks to a cancelled flight and that dreaded ~winter weather.~ So instead of flying out on Friday, I had the kind of serendipitously fun, falling-together-of-plans kind of night in New York that only happens when you\u2019re supposed to be somewhere else.Then, 12 hours behind schedule, I was somewhere else, fighting off single-digit temps with fiery Sichuan, a sauna-esque dance party, and a couple hours in the Garfield Park Conservatory aka the tropical bubble of my winter dreams.Kale pesto pasta is always in season.\u00a0\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Susie Theodorou, Prop Styling by Sophie StrangioLuckily I\u2019ve found a reason to head to warmer regions this weekend, specifically Palm Springs and then to LA, where Sara Kramer and Sarah Hymanson at Kismet are hosting Healthyish, Future of Women, and 50 of our guests for a breakfast convo about how climate change is affecting the food, fashion, and products we buy. The breakfast is sold out, but if you snagged a ticket I\u2019ll see you there.I\u2019ve seen a lot of you still making your way through the The Feel Good Food Plan, and that makes me happy! It\u2019s not a race; it\u2019s a journey. Between travels, I\u2019m cooking as much as possible too, albeit not always with recipes. Of course I\u2019ve bookmarked Basically\u2019s new congee, and we\u2019ve got a cabbage thing coming out soon that\u2019s the best thing to happen to cruciferous vegetables since Big-Flavor Broccoli. But more often I've been defaulting to something like elevated gym bro cuisine: steamed Japanese sweet potatoes, greens saut\u00e9ed in garlicky olive oil, shallow-fried chickpeas, and blender sauces made from whatever nuts, herbs, citrus, and flavor heavy-hitters (miso, fish sauce, anchovies, parm) I find in the fridge.I love these meals because they double as meal prep if you cook enough, and the components can be nudged into all kinds of other dishes: soups, pastas, or Desperation Shakshuka, named for the state of hunger and anxiety I was in when I made it earlier this week. I wasn\u2019t thinking straight, but I believe I was channeling David Tamarkin\u2019s Baked Feta, though I went pretty far afield: a half jar of harissa simmered with a can of whole peeled tomatoes then poured into a skillet with the aforementioned crispy chickpeas and a few giant handfuls of kale. I didn\u2019t have any feta so I cracked some eggs over the top instead\u2014voila, shakshuka?\u2014baked it until the eggs were just runny, and ate it with some lemon-spiked yogurt on top. Sure it would\u2019ve been better with pita or flatbread, but that\u2019s not what desperation cooking is about.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish EditorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletteressayRead MoreLifestyleI'm Feeling Better This YearBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
