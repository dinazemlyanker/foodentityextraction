I'm Day Drinking. I Require Wild Arc Farm's PiquetteThis low-ABV, fizzy wine is what\u2019s getting me through summer.By Emily SchultzAugust 22, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex LauFacebookTwitterEmailThis is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to our very opinionated editors\u2019 favorite things to eat, drink, and buy.The Tortoise and The Hare has more similarities with day drinking than you make think. Day drinking isn\u2019t about being the fastest one. When done properly, a slow and steady pace leaves you feeling like you\u2019ve accomplished enough fun to go to bed at 10 p.m., FOMO-free. That\u2019s very much my thing. So when it\u2019s peak summer and I\u2019m spending my Saturdays  at the beach, I'm reaching for Wild Arc Farm\u2019s piquette; the tart, bubbly, and responsible day-drinking beverage.But first, a history lesson. Piquette is an old French method where you add water to grape pomace, the grapes leftover from the wine pressing process, to make a second wine. Centuries ago, French field workers took home those scraps and poured in water and something sweet to kickstart fermentation. The result was a refreshing, effervescent drink that\u2019s now making a comeback.Todd Cavallo is the winemaker behind Wild Arc Farm, a biodynamic farm in the Hudson Valley that started in 2016. He\u2019s made a four-tiered rainbow of bubbly piquettes from the grapes he grows: floral Traminette, blackberry-like Teroldego, Cabernet Franc, and Riesling. I first tried the Riesling piquette from Henry\u2019s in Brooklyn, which has a mild sour taste that reminded me of licking a Warheads candy wrapper and the slightest fizz. It didn\u2019t take me long to try the rest, which you can now snag at Tiny\u2019s Bottle Shop in Philadelphia, Riverview Wine in Jersey City, or Kinsfolk Wine on Washington's Bainbridge Island.As I drank my way through the piquettes, I was constantly reminded of the wine coolers my mom brought to our beach house at the Jersey Shore. It had that same cloudy look but none of the syrupy-sweet aftertaste. And while my mom\u2019s wine coolers clocked in at around 5 percent ABV, the Wild Arc Farm\u2019s piquette sits pretty at 7 percent. It\u2019s the cool wine cooler, and I\u2019ll be sipping it on the beach all summer long.Find a bottle or join the mailing list to purchase directly: Wild Arc FarmExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendWineNew YorkRead MorecultureLeon and Sons\u2019 Wine Club Is the Only Kind of Club I\u2019ll JoinBy Emily SchultzRecipes you want to make.
