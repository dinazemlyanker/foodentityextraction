You\u2019ll get flare-ups as the fat melts onto the coals\u2014that\u2019s inevitable\u2014but instead of letting the chops char, just move them to a new spot as needed and keep going. This recipe is by Kelly Mariani from Scribe Winery in Sonoma, CA.Ingredients4 servings3garlic cloves, thinly sliced2Tbsp. chopped rosemary2Tbsp. plus \u00bd cup extra-virgin olive oil; plus more for peppers12lamb rib chops (about 2\u00bc lb. total), preferably unfrenchedKosher salt, freshly ground pepper1cup parsley leaves with tender stems\u00bdcup small dill sprigs1lemon12\u201316Jimmy Nardello peppers, 8 Cubanelle peppers, or 8 oz. shishito peppersRed wine vinegar (for serving)PreparationStep 1Pound garlic, rosemary, and 2 Tbsp. oil with a mortar and pestle until pulverized. (Alternatively, finely grate garlic and finely chop rosemary. Combine in a small bowl and mix in the oil.) Season lamb chops on both sides with salt and black pepper. Coat all over with garlic paste and let sit at room temperature 30 minutes or cover and chill up to 12 hours.Step 2Just before you are ready to grill the chops, make the herb salsa. Pound parsley and dill with mortar and pestle with a big pinch of salt until coarsely crushed. (Alternatively, finely chop the herbs and combine in a medium bowl.) Finely grate zest from lemon into herbs, then slice lemon in half and squeeze in its juice. Stir in \u00bd cup oil; taste and season herb salsa with more salt if needed.Step 3Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Grill lamb chops, turning often to encourage fat to render and moving to a new spot on the grill whenever there\u2019s a flare-up, until nicely charred on the outside but still pink in the center, 6\u20138 minutes. Transfer to a platter and let rest 5\u201310 minutes.Step 4While the chops are resting, toss peppers in a medium bowl with enough oil to coat; season with salt. Grill peppers, turning often, until skins are blistered and charred in spots and flesh is tender, about 3 minutes. Return to bowl, add a few dashes of vinegar, and toss to coat.Step 5Serve lamb and peppers with herb salsa for spooning over.How would you rate Grilled Lamb Chops and Peppers?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTriangleLove this recipe.
