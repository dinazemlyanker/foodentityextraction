Just a few, to get them out of the way.\u201cI get about one hundred emails a day now,\u201d says the yoga teacher, body positivity advocate, and writer. \u201cMy inbox is frightening at times.\u201dIn 2014, before she started popping up on your Instagram feed in fly Ivy Park athleisure and targeted Kotex ads, Stanley was a hostess at a tapas restaurant in downtown Durham, NC and taught yoga classes for restaurant workers looking to relieve their over-worked bodies. Her irreverent yoga tutorials on YouTube and Instagram have since garnered hundreds of thousands of followers. As a plus-sized, queer woman of color, she's captured the attention of a world that looks overwhelmingly different than her.When she\u2019s tamed her inbox, usually around 9 a.m., Stanley heads to her yoga room, a small bedroom painted a soothing shade of purple and empty except for her mat, a couple plants doused by soft sunlight, and usually a cat (she has three). \u201cThey\u2019re all very distinguished. They wear bowties!\u201d she says. She doesn\u2019t eat anything before she practices; she drinks cold water with lemon from a blue, 24-ounce glass Ball jar. A yoga swing made of sturdy parachute material is bolted to the doorway. The swing is good for hanging upside down and loosening vertebrae, she says. \u201cThese are sensations all humans should feel regularly, allowing your blood to flow in reverse. The whole world is different.\u201dThis morning yoga session lasts at least two hours, sometimes not wrapping until almost noon. She incorporates a lot of music: Kendrick Lamar for the lyrics (\u201cHe says a lot of things that light me up inside.\u201d); Fiona Apple to soothe a slippery mood. With so much traveling away from her home in Durham these days\u2014from Bali to Dubai to lectures around the country\u2014Stanley relishes in her home practice but always packs a yoga mat for hotel sessions. \u201cMy mat is like my toothbrush. I don\u2019t use other people\u2019s!\u201d she says.Some days, after practicing yoga, she drives up the road to her favorite coffee shop, Cocoa Cinnamon, for a latte. (\u201cI spend all my money on coffee.\u201d) Other days she makes tea at home. Tazo passion is a favorite\u2014a blend of rose hips, hibiscus and passion fruit, or anything with turmeric. \u201cI particularly appreciate its anti-inflammatory properties and how they make my joints feel,\u201d she says.Stanley takes daily vitamin packs from care/of, a company that puts together customized supplements. \u201cI take vitamins because I\u2019m not getting any younger and I want to preserve my vitality as much as possible,\u201d she says. Her pack includes what she says helps maintain her internal balance: astaxanthin (a potent antioxidant), fish oil, a probiotic blend, garlic, zinc, turmeric, and B-complex.Most mornings, she opts for protein-rich breakfasts: egg whites with hummus on toast, greens to the side, carrot juice to sip. Her diet is heavily influenced by how she was raised, in a small town near the South Carolina border, to parents that loved food and music. \u201cAll the women in my family are celebrated cooks. Food is a huge part of how we communicate with one another,\u201d she says. Her family also practiced Baha\u2019i, a religion with roots in Persia (modern-day Iran). \u201cSo I spent a lot of time with Iranian grandmas, making basmati rice, understanding dill and saffron,\u201d she says.Lately, Stanley is exploring the roots of veganism in black and indigenous cultures. \u201cBecause the concept of veganism has been so colonized and gentrified, people only see it one way,\u201d she says. \u201cThey don\u2019t necessarily understand it\u2019s just a way that many people have always eaten.\u201d Stanley isn\u2019t vegan or vegetarian, but both food traditions and nutrition intrigue her.  \u201cI\u2019m interested in vegan eating because my body has a hard time processing dairy products and meat,\u201d she admits, \u201cdespite the fact that I\u2019m a deeply bred Southerner with a long-fed love of mac and cheese and fried chicken.\u201d She\u2019s been exploring vegan soul food through her friend Lauren Von Der Pool\u2019s book Eat Yourself Sexy.After breakfast, she\u2019ll head to The Mothership, a female-led community working space, to finish emails, write, and plan her podcast. (When she visits New York, she works out of The Wing, a women\u2019s co-working space that she says reminds her of a place where Harriet the Spy would hang out.) Stanley often gets asked if she\u2019ll move to Los Angeles or New York. But she\u2019s rooted in Durham, Southern born and bred. \u201cI\u2019m happy here, so what\u2019s the point of [living] anywhere else?\u201dDespite her many followers and partnerships with brands like Target and Samsung, fame hasn't fazed Stanley. \u201cI don\u2019t get caught up in notoriety. I know that it\u2019s fleeting.\u201d This unapologetic attitude has become her brand; it\u2019s what draws people in. The first episode of Stanley\u2019s new podcast, \u201cJessamyn Explains It All,\u201d comes with a frank disclaimer: \u201cParts of the show might be offensive. They might be offensive to you. It might get real in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable. But. Now you know.\u201d That last bit she delivers crisp, like she\u2019s saying it with a coy smile.Explore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishprofileRead MorecultureMeet the Equinox Trainer Who Made Us Love the GymBy Sue Li and Alex PollackRecipes you want to make.
