It\u2019s a sun-drenched Thursday morning in Los Angeles, and, in between bites of a gloriously runny egg sandwich, the actress is recalling growing up in the Brooklyn neighborhood of East New York in the early \u201990s, when her options were limited to bodega bites and fast food.\u201cI knew that I wasn't eating well,\u201d she continues. \u201cI wouldn't eat for a while, then I'd get so hungry I'd be like, \u2018I'm just gonna go get a Philly cheesesteak,\u2019 and I\u2019d crash into what I was trying to avoid.\u201dDominique Fishback first left East New York to attend Pace College in Manhattan, where she discovered foods like Pinkberry for the first time (\u201cIt changed my life,\u201d she says. \u201cI was trying to get my cousins from East New York to travel, but they were not going to go to Manhattan for frozen yogurt.\u201d)Shortly after she graduated, her acting career took off\u2014catch her reprising her role as Darlene, a \u201970s-era sex worker, in the second season of HBO\u2019s The Deuce, as well as in the film The Hate U Give, out today. During filming, she had the opportunity to eat almost anything (well, as long as it was being provided by on-set catering), but still wasn\u2019t feeling good about her choices.Fishback shooting hoops at a court by her apartment in Bed Stuy.\nSo she became pescatarian. \u201cI was such a fast food girl, so people are really, really surprised by that,\u201d she says now. \u201cI had Big Macs all the time.\u201dThese days, she\u2019s into fresh fruit, and the vegan Jamaican food at Bed Stuy\u2019s Natural Blends, which does some of her favorite dishes, like curried chicken\u2014without the chicken. \u201cThe tastes and the flavors that I was craving, I thought I couldn't have anymore, Fishback says. \u201cBut it's not true.\u201dThe travel her job requires\u2014she just spent a few weeks on the road, first in France then in Canada promoting The Hate U Give\u2014 has also helped expand her palate beyond what her old neighborhood could offer, and she has mixed feelings about that.The dearth of culinary options in minority neighborhoods is a systemic issue that Fishback addressed in her one-woman show, Subverted, in a segment on imprisonment. \u201cTo be imprisoned isn't necessarily being behind bars,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut in these neighborhoods, you have a certain radius that you go about, and these are the food options: Chinese, the corner store.\u201dThe Hate U Give is about a young black girl named Starr (played by Amandla Sternberg) who witnesses a police shooting of a close friend, so it\u2019s no wonder that Fishback has the opportunities of the larger black community on her mind these days. She\u2019s grateful to to have seen so much more of the world, but she looks back with frustration at what her neighborhood used to look like, and how it\u2019s changing as more affluent and white folks move in. \u201cNow there's a Planet Fitness, like we ain't never wanted to get fit before,\u201d she says. \u201cNow there's a VisionWorks. You don't think we needed glasses before?\u201dAnd she\u2019s still trying to figure out how to navigate her success as an actress. \u201cIt's hard for friends who are not where they wanna be at when I'm like, \u2018I didn't book nothing up \u2018til the end of this year.\u2019 And they're like, \u2018but you're on this show!\u2019\u201d Fishback says.\u201cBut a show isn't forever, and one show doesn't make your career. So I always approach everything like, What's the next thing? How do I create longevity in my career?\u201dWhen she\u2019s not working, Fishback decompresses with one of her first loves: basketball. She first played football in middle school, and she was the only girl. It was only when the coach cancelled practice one day and Fishback found herself in the gym idly shooting hoops that the basketball coach spotted her talent. \u201cShe was like, \u2018Fishback, you want to be on the basketball team?\u2019 I was like, \u2018I don't play basketball. I play football.\u2019 She was like, \u2018You could learn.\u2019\u201d And that was that.These days, she can\u2019t fit in as many pickup games as she\u2019d like, so if she\u2019s feeling antsy she\u2019ll go to the gym. \u201cI'm trying to find a routine that I like, but I don't really have one,\u201d she says.Given how hectic her schedule is, the pace of the news cycle, and the toll it can take on the black community, Fishback is careful to tend to her mental as well as her physical health. \u201cThe building I live in now had a rooftop. I can just go sit up there and clear my mind and think and thank god and write and be at peace, which is a nice thing,\u201d she says. \u201cI've never felt at peace, really. In East New York, I had experiences there that eliminate peace, you know?\u201dShe also goes to therapy and encourages her family members to go too. \u201cCause you don't realize how much you carry, and it influences all the choices you make,\u201d she says.Ultimately, though, one of the most important things to Fishback is having a voice: not just waiting for parts to come to her, but writing plays like Subverted and feature scripts that allow her to express herself in her own words. \u201cIt's hard when I see the news and something that I wrote three or four years ago is still relevant, but at least I know that as an artist, I gave my contribution and I will continue to do that,\u201d Fishback says. \u201cRight now, I'm trying to keep moving and keep happy.\u201dExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishCelebritiesInterviewsRead MorecultureNicole Byer Is #VeryFatVeryBrave, Thank You Very MuchBy Alyse WhitneyRecipes you want to make.
