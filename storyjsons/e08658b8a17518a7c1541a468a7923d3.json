Pro tip: If you sign up for the newsletter, you'll get the scoop before everyone else.Healthyish friends,I made a lot of food on Monday night because that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing on Monday nights. I don\u2019t call it meal prep because I hate that phrase: The word \u201cprep\u201d makes me feel like a fitness competitor (sorry, don\u2019t go down that rabbit hole), and I\u2019m not making meals, really, more like ingredients. Butternut squash, roasted and mashed. A big pot of greens. Chickpeas, crisped on a sheet pan. Kinda boring, TBH. But lining up those containers in my fridge is one thing that makes me feel better about the week, every week that I do it.As I was packing up everything this time, I found myself calculating how long this food would last me if I couldn\u2019t leave my apartment for a while. If I were quarantined. I\u2019d seen photos online of grocery stores with empty shelves and empty freezer cases. I\u2019d seen a lot of people using hand sanitizer on the subway that day. We\u2019ve been told for weeks to prepare for a coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., and now it\u2019s happening, and we\u2019re being told to keep preparing because it\u2019s going to get worse.I come from a family who loves to be prepared. There are three generations of Eagle Scouts among us. We show up for holidays and immediately start asking each other \u201cwhat the plan is.\u201d My mom sometimes emails itineraries, including meals and sleeping arrangements, in advance of family gatherings, just to ease everyone\u2019s minds. I think planning is our way of dealing with anxieties; we all feel better when we know what to expect.When faced with uncertainty, our brains like to go to work, solving problems and accomplishing tasks. Sometimes this work is helpful; in fact, it\u2019s often crucial. I started cooking weekly because I needed to stop spending ten minutes in front of the salads at Pret, debating falafel vs. chicken and sweet potato. I needed to stop spending the money too.Another good thing to prep: chickpeas.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, Food Styling by Sue Li, Prop Styling by Kalen KaminskiWhen it comes to preparing amid the coronavirus, there are things I know I can do: buy food, water, and other essentials, wash my hands more. And there are scenarios I can plan for, like how I might get to my parents if, say, travel is restricted. What I would pack. My dog. But the reality is that I don\u2019t know what to expect. And since I don\u2019t have a doomsday bunker or a private jet to get me there, I can\u2019t do a whole lot more than that.I had dinner with a friend last night. She and her partner are pregnant with their first child\u2014a big, scary unknown of another sort. We talked about her fears about being a parent and how hard it was to prepare for this major life event when it was all so theoretical. She could read all the books and blogs and Reddit threads on parenting, but, as everyone who\u2019s ever done it says, you just figure it out as you go.I feel anxious about coronavirus in a vague, free-floating way. My brain wants to plan more, think harder, solve all the potential problems that might arise. But instead I\u2019m doing what I always do\u2014riding the subway, going to the gym, going to my favorite Chinatown grocery store for dried shiitake mushrooms, so I can make Andy Baraghani\u2019s new vegetarian ramen recipe. I wash my hands when I get home. I count the containers in the fridge and wonder how long the food could last. I keep one eye on the news and wait for information and trust that I\u2019ll figure it out as I go. And maybe that\u2019s what preparing looks like, too.Until next week,Amanda ShapiroHealthyish editorExplore Bon App\u00e9titHealthyishHealthyish NewsletteressayCoronavirusRead MoreLifestyleBig Bean MoodBy Amanda ShapiroRecipes you want to make.
