Burning the spices re-creates at home the slightly bitter taste and smell you get from the 800\u00b0-plus oven. \u201cRoasting, then grinding masala adds depth of flavor to the wings,\u201d Mistry says. \u201cThe tamarind sauce is a nice tangy foil.\u201dIf you don\u2019t eat meat on holidays like Holi, skip these wings and find more of chef Preeti Mistry\u2019s Holi party recipes here.Ingredients8 ServingsBurnt Masala8black cardamom pods3green cardamom pods3chiles de \u00e1rbol22\" cinnamon sticks1Tbsp. black peppercorns1\u00bdtsp. whole clovesMarinadeJuice of 2 lemonsJuice of 4 limes2serrano chiles, finely chopped4garlic cloves, finely chopped14\" piece ginger, finely chopped3Tbsp. vegetable oil4tsp.

My father would eat at KFC if he had it his way (or if there was no one here to cook for him) and he can be quite picky when it comes to food but he has always trusted my cooking. Everyone loved this recipe (even dad) and I cannot wait to make it again. Next time I might do the second 15-20 minutes on the grill for extra flavor.thenamesantGrand Haven, MI4/11/2021Made these for a picnic and Indians and non-Indians alike enjoyed them! This might be down to personal preference, but I added a LOT more sugar into the glaze as it was cooking (at least triple Preeti's recipe), because I found the tamarind to be too intense and I wanted the contrast of smokey spices with a sweet glaze. Other than that I found it to be relatively easy for so much flavor.
