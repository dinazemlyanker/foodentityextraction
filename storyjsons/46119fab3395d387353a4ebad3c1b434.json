Lots and lots of leafy, spicy, boldly flavored greens. This is AeroFarms, which just happens to be the world\u2019s largest indoor vertical farm. It uses 95% less water than traditional farming methods and the greens grow happily free of pesticides, herbicides, and other similar chemicals. Once the greens reach peak freshness, they\u2019re packed up and delivered to caterers who will prime them for their culinary journey on Singapore Airlines out of Newark Liberty International Airport. The result? Brighter, tastier meals in the air.AeroFarms' facility in Newark\nSingapore Airlines is no stranger to innovation. They\u2019ve cultivated quite the reputation of \u201cfirsts.\u201d Back in 1970, they were the first airline to offer free headsets, a meal choice, and free drinks in Economy class; in 1989, they became the first to fly non-stop across the Pacific between Hong Kong and San Francisco; and among many other firsts, they are the first to go to such great heights to support sustainability without sacrificing quality.For years, Singapore Airlines has been using more sustainable, plant-based ingredients in its in-flight meals where possible, sourcing local produce including everything from cherry tomatoes to pumpkins from farms in Singapore and destination countries. They\u2019ve even sourced fish from fisheries certified by the Marine Stewardship Council for their sustainable practices. Not only does AeroFarms\u2019 approach to reimagining plant-based cuisine offer more robust flavors in air, where taste is typically dulled in flight, but it also ensures access to fresh, nutrient-rich foods year round.A Singapore Airlines\u2019 Business Class meal service\nSingapore Airlines\u2019 food and dining program is already one of the best, featuring a team of chefs that even taste select meals in a simulated pressurized cabin to ensure maximum flavor 30,000 feet in the air. Their International Culinary Panel is made up of chefs from New York, Los Angeles, Milan, Mumbai, Shanghai, to name a few, and culls their epicurean expertise to develop delicious, inventive cuisine on board. Why should you wait until you land at your destination to begin a culinary adventure?Additionally, Singapore Airlines\u2019 new wine program includes a new selection of high-quality, small-batch wines. For example, premium class passengers have access to the most in-flight Burgundy options, with 47 different labels in rotation over 18 months.
