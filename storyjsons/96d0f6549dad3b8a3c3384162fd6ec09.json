While there\u2019s something satisfying about the airy crustiness of a baguette, halved ciabatta rolls or slices of sourdough or whole wheat bread would work just as well.Ingredients2 Servings1small shallot or \u00bc red onion, thinly sliced1Tbsp. plus 1\u00bd tsp. sherry vinegar or red wine vinegarPinch of sugarKosher salt, freshly ground pepper1small head of broccoli (8\u201310 oz.)3Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil1garlic clove2Tbsp. mayonnaise1tsp. hot chili sauce (such as Sriracha)26\" pieces baguette, halved lengthwise4slices sharp cheddarPreparationStep 1Heat broiler.

First of all, it was a lot of work; chopping broccoli, cooking broccoli, grating garlic, thinly slicing red onion and mixing together the mayonnaise.  All said and done, too much work for a low return in the flavor of the results.AnonymousVienna, VA4/27/2021Quick and delicious! Really awesome lunch time meal!AnonymousHouston, TX3/19/2021I made some changes to make it more lazy. I quick pickled the shallots in the vinegar and roasted frozen broccoli with seasoning to cook it. I topped the toasted bread with the hot sauce mixture, broccoli, shallots and cheese and toasted it. Didn't need to use anything but my toaster oven/air fryer and it was delicious!  hansika3/3/2021Simple and delicious. Also great with Italian bread, Swiss cheese and zucchini. Very versatile recipe, will probably try this with all sorts of veggie.AnonymousNY2/19/2021Sooo good!
