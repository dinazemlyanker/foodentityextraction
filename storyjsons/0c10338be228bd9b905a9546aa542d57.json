You can use rotisserie chicken or your own leftovers. But what really makes this recipe stand out is the blue cheese dressing, which is mild enough to convert the blue cheese adverse. We used Lodge\u2019s 17\" cast iron skillet because we like the ease of the double handles.Ingredients4 servings1lb. homemade or store-bought pizza dough1Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling1cup hot sauce (preferably Frank\u2019s)\u00bdcup prepared marinara sauce\u00bccup (\u00bd stick) unsalted butter2Tbsp. heavy cream2cups cooked chicken, torn into bite-size pieces\u00bdcup whole-milk plain yogurt (not Greek)\u00bdtsp. fresh lemon juice\u00bctsp. celery salt\u00bctsp. garlic powder2\u00bdoz. mild blue cheese, crumbled (about \u00bd cup), divided\u00bdtsp. freshly ground black pepper, plus moreAll-purpose flour (for dusting)9oz. mozzarella cheese, shredded (about 2 cups)2celery stalks, thinly slicedPreparationStep 1Place a rack in upper third of oven. Place a large cast-iron skillet on rack and preheat oven to 500\u00b0 (or as high as your oven will go). Place pizza dough in a large bowl, pour a little oil over, and turn to coat. Cover bowl with plastic and let dough proof at room temperature while pan and oven heat up.Step 2Meanwhile, cook hot sauce, marinara sauce, and butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until butter is melted. Stir in cream, reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened and warmed through, about 10 minutes.Step 3Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add chicken, toss to coat, then add \u00bc cup Buffalo sauce. Cook chicken, tossing occasionally, until heated through, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring often, until chicken is well coated and sauce is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.Step 4Meanwhile, whisk yogurt, lemon juice, celery salt, garlic powder, \u00bc cup blue cheese, \u00bd tsp. pepper, and 2 Tbsp. water in a small bowl, adding more water if sauce seems too thick (it should be pourable); set aside.Step 5Turn out dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Shape with your hands into a round that\u2019s slightly larger than the cast-iron skillet you\u2019re using. Take hot skillet out of oven (watch that handle!) and place on a heatproof surface. Add a little flour to pan. Lay dough in skillet, then work edges of dough up sides of skillet with your fingertips (use a rubber spatula or wooden spoon if you\u2019re nervous about touching the hot pan). Drizzle a little oil around inside edge of pan so that it trickles behind and underneath dough, which will encourage browning and help it release.Step 6Spread about \u2153 cup Buffalo sauce over dough. Arrange mozzarella over, then top with remaining \u00bc cup blue cheese. Arrange chicken mixture on top.Step 7Bake pizza on top rack until crust and cheese are nicely browned, 15\u201320 minutes. Transfer skillet to stovetop (again, watch that handle!) and let pizza rest a few minutes. Using a spatula, slide pizza onto a cutting board or platter.Step 8Arrange celery over, then top with reserved blue cheese dressing. Season with pepper, then drizzle with oil.Step 9Do Ahead: Buffalo sauce can be made 5 days ahead. Transfer to an airtight container and chill. Blue cheese dressing can be made 1 week ahead. Transfer to an airtight container and chill.How would you rate Buffalo Chicken Pizza?Leave a ReviewTell us what you thinkReviews (2)Back to TopTrianglePlease answer quickly- Preparing this tonight to cook tomorrow.\n \u201c... then top with reserved blue cheese dressing.\u201d makes me think I need to use some before this final step. There is no mention of this, and there seems to be a lot of dressing. Thoughts? \nAlso, hot/marinara adds up to almost 2 cups. Directions only use about 1/2 a cup. What gives?\nFinally, every time I try to give a star rating it defaults to 5 stars. That\u2019s not right. \nThanks!\nBobBobReno4/9/2021Amazing! Absolutely delicious and not crazy spicy.
