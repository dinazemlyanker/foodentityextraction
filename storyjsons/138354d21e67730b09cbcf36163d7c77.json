As we drove the length of the Atlantic City expressway, we would peel off at Exit 2 to make our way to the shore house. Before I perfected this route, my grandmother taught me a trick:\u201cLick your pointer finger. If it tastes like salt, you\u2019re down the shore.\u201dWe\u2019d get in from what felt like a journey\u2014my family isn\u2019t much for road trips\u2014and visit my paternal grandmother, who lived in Atlantic City full time. We\u2019d walk the two blocks from her apartment on Raleigh Avenue to Richmond Avenue and catch up over slices at Fiesta pizza. She would ask for her pizza with minimal crust while adjusting her hearing aid. Other times we\u2019d drive down to Mento\u2019s, a family-run water ice (like a smoother Italian ice) spot in the basement of a house. We\u2019d get cherry water ice that would stain our tongues for the rest of the night and overstay our welcome on the brown-painted picnic table facing Ventnor Avenue. Then I\u2019d part ways with my grandmother and immediately make plans with cousins or second-cousins or friends-who-we-called-cousins.The next morning we\u2019d walk eight blocks to my maternal grandparents\u2019 house, stopping at the corner store on our way to pick up a loaf or two of Atlantic City bread\u2014long, squishy, pale baguettes that make for the best beach hoagie of your life. My cousins would come barreling down the stairs as soon as they heard the crinkle of the wax paper revealing an array of cold cuts my grandmother had picked up from the deli. We would each point to the items we wanted in our sandwich: wiggly deli turkey breast, bright pink salami, smooth yellow mustard. After our creations were assembled we would walk to the beach past Florida Cold Cuts, a corner store that we were not allowed to go into due to a certain fight between my mom and the owner that happened in regard to ranch dressing (it\u2019s best not to ask).Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Or maybe it was a day that we skipped the Atlantic City bread because we were going to order stuffed Italian hoagies, layered high with salami, mortadella, and provolone cheese. We\u2019d get them from Dino\u2019s or Sack O\u2019 Subs if no one wanted to leave the beach\u2014the delivery person literally walked onto the sand to hand over the precious cargo. Sometimes my dad\u2019s family would be visiting, so he\u2019d drive into the city itself and pick up some famous White House Subs\u2014the ones stuffed with hot peppers, stacks of cold cuts, and crunchy lettuce. We ate the hoagies right there on the beach, my mom trying to get the sand off a towel as my cousin chased a paper plate in a gust of wind.Or maybe it was one of those super hot days in August\u2014you know the kind where the ocean is filled with seaweed so you have no choice but to bake in the sun? Then maybe we would walk down to the beach on Washington Avenue and buy a Chipwich from John the Ice Cream Man. We would wave him down, more excited to see him than anyone else in the world. He would tell us to wait until the bits of ice that had clung to the plastic packaging melted off, and one of the adults would fling a stack of dollar bills at him.So yeah, none of these are red sauce places. But nothing feels more Italian-American to me than eating meals\u2014everyday meals, not just the big displays of piccata or parm\u2014down the shore with my boisterous family, whose last names all happen to end in vowels. And each trip, before we knew it, the weekend would be over and we would get in the car to drive back to the other side of New Jersey, letting the salty air in through an open window until it was time to get back on the highway.Emily Schultz is the social media manager at Bon App\u00e9tit.Explore Bon App\u00e9titItalian AmericanNew JerseyRestaurantsRed SauceRead MorerestaurantsRed Sauce AmericaBy Bon App\u00e9titRecipes you want to make.
