I made two adjustments only.  I added fresh asparagus cut into 2  inch lengths at the point where the heat was dropped to 300 and the salmon was added. And I placed the salmon on a bed of farro. The nutty flavor of the farro paired perfectly with the roasted red veggies and the pepitas. \nNext time I will double the squash. (Note I did peel the squash.  I have had the delicata peeked and unpeeled and much prefer it peeled.) This morning my wife said \u201cMake that again!\u201d Steve TremainBenicia, CA3/14/2022The BA recipe only is allowing me to leave 5 stars, lol but I would be leaving 2 stars ONLY because the combination of flavors in the sauce was excellent! Saving this sauce for a later date. The onions were also excellent with the sauce.\n\nThe squash and cauliflower were okay, and the serranos were way too much spice in the dish. I think the salmon would've served better as a whitefish or marinated in the sauce. It was also not a good looking dish. Would not make again.AnonymousLas Vegas, NV6/23/2021Love, love, love this recipe! I couldn't find delicata squash so I did have to make a substitution so I chose Honeynut squash. I have made the sauce to use in other recipes also recently. I just love miso as a delicious and versatile flavor element. Yum, five stars!Sophia Creme Paulekas ClarkEureka CA4/3/2021Never bought white miso before. Little tub for $9.00. Maybe if you live in a city with a Japan town ?cheaper. I live in a cow town. White miso is tan and pastey. It looks like hot buttered rum mix. My veggies came out mushy. The salmon was thick however. What's wierd is I did not like the salmon with this dressing, but I liked the flavor of the veggies with this dressing. So will make veggies again as side dish with leftover dressing. Maybe a few times with left over miso. Now to Google a recipe with miso to use up miso.J9Chico, CA2/2/2021Absolutely delicious. The miso dressing gave brightness and paired perfectly with the roasted veggies. This was my first time cooking delicata squash...and whoa. This squash is sweet and was super easy to prep. The serranos were the perfect final touch, giving some heat alongside the citrus flavors and sweetness from the roasted veggies. My family cleared their plates, so my only regret is not having any leftovers. AnonymousOakland, CA1/25/2021This was really delicious! The cauliflower and squash had a creamy and delicious texture that contrasted really well with the pepitas. Agree with another reviewer, the mojo could probably be cut in half.NatcookieDenver, CO12/10/2020I really, really loved this. I did need to swap out the squash- I used acorn. Very good, and I'll definitely be making again. I'm actually only starting to venture into cooking (I'm more of a baker) but this was really easy/approachable for me. AnonymousSan Francisco3/12/2020Yum!  Super easy!  Used pine nuts because I didn't have pepitas.  AnonymousOakland10/10/2019Delicious.  A nice fresh take on salmon with roasted vegetables.  The miso mojo makes a lot and could easily be cut in half.  I agree with the other reviewer who indicated longer roasting times than anticipated.AnonymousColorado Springs, CO10/7/2019We loved this! So easy, healthy, and filling! The leftover miso mojo made a great dressing for an arugula salad the next night. Happy squash season! AnonymousWinston-Salem, NC9/20/2019Holy forking shirtballs this was good. Miso isn't a flavor my family normally uses, so I was a bit nervous about it going over well, but it was a winner. Definitely one of those whole is greater than the sum of its part dishes. Subbed in butternut squash because delicata  was nowhere to be found as well as jalepenos for serranos, but it was simply delish. AnonymousCambridge, MA1/24/2019This was amazing. both veggies and salmon take a bit longer than the time mentioned but absolutely delicious combination and the dressing was absolutely delicious.AnonymousLos Angeles1/16/2019This is on the regular rotation.  Slow roasting salmon is the only way to go.  We like things spicy and the serrano's with seeds really make the miso sauce pop.  Great as leftovers!CookinVTShelburne, Vermont1/9/2019This dish was straight up fantastic. I couldn't find Serrano Chile at my store so I had to substitute it with Jalapenos. However I felt it needed an herb-y context so I blended the miso mojo with tender cilantro stems and extra Jalapeno and followed the rest of the recipe as is. It was delightful. Highly recommend this dish for a healthy dinner, or even lunch the next day!sharvadordali9410412/18/2018Made this for dinner tonight. It was a great healthy meal after the Thanksgiving feasting! My salmon also took a little longer than the recipe called for. The vegetable combination was great.  We liked the dressing and thought it would also be good on roasted chicken or just the veggies. I used store-bought salad topping roasted pepitas since I couldn't find any other kind and they were still good.
