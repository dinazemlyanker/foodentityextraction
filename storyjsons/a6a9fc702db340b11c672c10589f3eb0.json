We have a lot of experience with this topic.By Marissa A. RossMarch 8, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Marissa A. RossFacebookTwitterEmailNot unlike Liam Neeson in Taken, I too have a very particular set of skills: writing and drinking wine. At the same damn time. Some may argue this is not an actual skill set. It is true you cannot get a degree in it, nor will it save anyone from kidnappers. Also, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it on a resum\u00e9. But the truth is, most of us come home from a long day and still have to be productive even though all we want to do is pour a glass of wine. Whether you\u2019re working on your side-hustle, a midterm essay, or a three-act play about the inner thoughts of Maine Coon cats, all I\u2019m saying is, you can do it with wine. Here\u2019s how.First, you want to avoid big, high-alcohol wines. I know cozying up with a bold Napa Cab and your laptop at night may sound romantic, but you\u2019re not going to get shit done. You\u2019re going to accidentally get a little drunk, watch an episode of Law & Order: SVU you\u2019ve already seen a million times, and fall asleep on the couch. Stick with wines that are 12.5 percent ABV (alcohol by volume) or less.You also want to get a natural wine if possible. This is not only so you can take an Instagram because these wines are suddenly \u201ccool,\u201d but it\u2019s also because commercial wines can have dozens and dozens of chemicals and additives. These extra ingredients are often never disclosed, and you can have no idea how they affect your body. Choosing a natural, organic, and/or biodynamic wine will decrease the likelihood of headaches or hangovers if you decide to really get crankin\u2019.Personally, I love juicy wines with lots of acidity and tartness to keep me feeling energetic and awake. Here are a handful of my favorites to try now and write with later.Photo by Marissa A. RossFor Writing Poetry Inspired by NatureFurlani \u201cSur Lie Alpino Macerato\u201d Pinot Grigio$23, Domaine LAWhether you prefer to cozy up in a mountain lodge or nap on a secluded beach, Furlani\u2019s sparkling \u201cSur Lie Alpino Macerato\u201d will inspire all your earthly desires. This nearly nude sparkler from Trento, Italy, is unlike any Pinot Grigio you\u2019ve ever had. It transcends seasonality with flavors of grilled summer peaches, tangerines, and limes combined with eucalyptus, pine trees, and new snow. Light and bubbly with heightened minerality, you\u2019ll be blasting through flowery haikus with a bottle of Furlani regardless of the landscape.Photo by Marissa A. RossFor Writing Under the Tuscan Sun 2: Over the AlpsBernhard Ott \u201cFass 4\u201d Gr\u00fcner Veltliner$26, Lou Wine ShopWe live in a divided world, but if there is one thing we can all agree on, it\u2019s DIANE LANE. If a new Diane Lane joint came out right now, it would be the only movie I\u2019d see in the theater besides Black Panther. Bernhard Ott\u2019s \u201cFass 4\u201d is exactly what Diane would be drinking on an Austrian veranda with Sandra Oh while contemplating their lives with some real Nora Ephron\u2013esque dialogue. It smells and tastes like gardenias, fennel, and spiced cantaloupe\u2014 straight from the hot neighbor\u2019s garden, obvi\u2014drizzled in homemade olive oil, tossed with white pepper, and served over polished stoneware. This is a white wine both you and your mom will love, JUST LIKE DIANE LANE!Photo by Marissa A. RossFor Writing That Assignment You Really Don\u2019t Want to WritePatrick Sullivan \u201cJumpin\u2019 Juice\u201d Ros\u00e9$27, Domaine LANo matter how much you love writing, there will always be assignments that leave you with your head slung back, moaning \u201cuuughhh\u2026\u201d into the void. The only recourse is to power through, but when you\u2019re that unmotivated, you need an exceptionally exciting wine to keep you going. Patrick Sullivan\u2019s creation is a deliciously vibrant punch in the taste buds. The \u201cJumpin\u2019 Juice\u201d ros\u00e9, made of S\u00e9millon, Sauvignon Blanc and Moscato Giallo, is a fiery coral color in the glass and smells like guava, nectarine, and mango are tubing across a lemonade lake. Despite the tropical nose, this wine is shockingly alive: It tastes like a cold, Pacific, cranberry-limeade wave and feels like you doused your face with ice water at 2 a.m. so you don\u2019t have to actually douse your face with ice water at 2 a.m. when you finally reach that word count.Photo by Marissa A. RossFor Short Stories Inspired by Reading Hemingway OnceVini Viti Vinci \u201cLe Rougeot\u201d Pinot Noir$26, Domaine LAThere is nothing more difficult than doing something simply. Or rather, doing something simply well. This applies to wine as much as it applies to words. Much like Hemingway\u2019s prose, Vini Viti Vinci\u2019s \u201cLe Rougeot\u201d Pinot Noir is direct but with finesse. It smells like peppered cranberries in dusty trenches, and it tastes like ripe raspberries and sour black cherries strolling hand in hand down a stony Parisian street where they briefly run into their buddy Brett(anomyces). Both sharp and soft in all the right places, you might as well be in chapter three of A Moveable Feast. (That\u2019s the one you read, right? Yeah, ol\u2019 Hem-dawg and his wife are in Burgundy, the same region this wine is made.)Photo by Marissa A. RossFor Writing About Yourself, I Mean, Your Book of EssaysFran\u00e7ois Saint-L\u00f4 \u201cHey Gro!!\u201d Grolleau$27, Lou Wine ShopYou have a lot of opinions and even more stories, which you feel compelled to share with the world. Great! Do it! And do it with Fran\u00e7ois Saint-L\u00f4 \u201cHey Gro!!\u201d Grolleau. This wine from France\u2019s Loire Valley smells like goji berries tossed in allspice and tastes like crunchy cranberries and raspberries with salty eucalyptus. It goes down like delicious water, allowing you to focus on what\u2019s important: You! And at only 8.5 percent alcohol by volume, you could drink this entire bottle while crafting your very unique and interesting perspectives about millennial dating and Labradoodles without becoming arrogant and incomprehensible.The best part about all these wines, though, is that you don\u2019t need to be a writer to enjoy them. All you need is a glass.Marissa Ross is the author of Wine. All the Time.
