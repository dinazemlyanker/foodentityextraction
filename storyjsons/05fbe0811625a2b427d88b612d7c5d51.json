Up in The Heights, right across the mighty Hudson River, it brings something to the neighborhood that\u2019s been missing for far too long: an approachable restaurant with fantastic Italian food. Oh, and a backyard space too!Everything on the Italian-inspired menu is delicious. Chef Matt Moschella puts an amazing meat-and-cheese plate that he changes every day. The one above features bresaola, mortadella, finocchiona from old-school NYC deli Salumeria Biellese; NJ-made crema de bleu and pepato from Valley Shepherd Creamery; fermented broccoli rabe from Italy; cherries from the garden at Corto; and crackled carta di musica. Now that\u2019s a cheese plate!He also makes fresh pastas\u2014get the spaghetti, get the ravioli, get any of the pastas, really! There\u2019s always a fish on the menu, like whole bass or skin-on tile fish, which you should definitely get, and staples like the angry chicken (Calabrian chiles will do that to you), perfectly cooked octopus over borlotti beans, and ricotta toast with honey and TONS of crushed pink peppercorns, which, yeah, you should order. Haven\u2019t had a just-okay dish yet.Every meal at Corto has left me satisfied and I can\u2019t recommend it enough. All the food is simple and thoughtful without lacking creativity and quality. These young folks know what they\u2019re doing!Go there: CortoExplore Bon App\u00e9titHighly RecommendNew JerseyItalianRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
