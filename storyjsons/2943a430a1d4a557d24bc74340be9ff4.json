This 7-quart Dutch oven is made with four layers of premium enamel for extra durability and a nearly nonstick surface. When purchasing, you also have the option to pick between a regular lid and one that doubles as a hefty grill pan.Misen 7 Quart Dutch Oven$165 at MisenSerrated knifeA.K.A. the Bread Knife. Our friends at Epicurious tested a bunch of serrated knives and chose Misen\u2019s as their top pick. Made with premium Japanese steel, this knife will adequately retain its sharp edge and durability for years to come. It\u2019s got exactly 32 pointed tips, all optimized to slice through everything from squishy tomatoes to hardy boules. It\u2019s also crafted with a sloped bolster at the handle to encourage your perfect pinch grip for max comfort and control. Baker Joy Huang tells us, \u201cI\u2019ve used bread knives before that were too flimsy, which made it hard to get through the crusty sourdoughs, but my Misen knife is long and sturdy.\u201dMisen Serrated Knife$70 at MisenSteak knivesYour kitchen deserves knives that are as good\u2014or even better\u2014than the ones at Outback Steakhouse. Like the bread knife, Misen\u2019s steak knives are made of premium Japanese steel for maximum function and durability. With sharp, serrated edges, they slice into food without shredding or crushing, leaving just a smooth, clean cut. Plus, their slim, angular design makes them comfy and nice to look at. Choose between a set of four or eight in a variety of colors.Misen Steak Knives$80 at MisenExplore Bon App\u00e9titShoppingValentines DayRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
