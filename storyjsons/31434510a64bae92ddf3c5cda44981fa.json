How could we not, then, turn the lens on chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, whose organization World Central Kitchen provides meals in times of crisis. But if you want to know who Andr\u00e9s would invite to his Dream Dinner Party, you\u2019re in the right place.You\u2019ve traveled the world and met so many people. Which three would be at your dream dinner party?Dolores Huerta. She\u2019s a fighter for workers\u2019 rights, for farmers, for food. When we talk about hunger and food production, we often miss the most important part, which is the people. Huerta fights for the people. I\u2019d also invite Harriet Tubman, who brought many slaves to freedom. While others were giving speeches, she had boots on the ground. She kept going back into danger because she didn\u2019t want to have freedom while others didn\u2019t. And Clara Barton, founder of the American Red Cross. Her office was in D.C., where I opened my first restaurant. She did amazing work, caring for wounded soldiers and bringing relief to their families through the Missing Soldiers Office.Tubman\u2019s on my list too. What would you ask this group of powerhouse women?Women carry the world forward. Yet it seems men dictate how we move humanity forward. Why? What can we do to bring more women into leadership? How do we ensure armies of women are in every corner of society, running companies, running hospitals? This is not about equality. It\u2019s about pragmatism.What\u2019s on the menu?\u00a0I\u2019d start with gazpacho. I was amazed to discover the recipe for gazpacho\u2014the quintessential summertime soup in Spain, where I come from\u2014in a 19th-century cookbook from Virginia, in the United States\u2026the country where I belong. When you\u2019re an immigrant, you have a heart in both places. So you can build bridges, and show how many things two cultures share, versus how different they are.Women who change the world need more than soup!Oysters. I am crazy for oysters. I\u2019m becoming briny like the Chesapeake Bay, and I\u2019ve got a lot of stories\u2014from the history of oyster ketchup, a forgotten condiment made from oysters, vinegar, and black pepper [it\u2019s older than tomato ketchup, made as far back as the 1700s] to the tales I\u2019ve heard from generations of oyster farmers.Cold soup and oysters sound lovely but I need more.\u00a0My mom, a nurse, used to roast peppers until the skin turned brown; then she would peel them and separate the skin from the seeds. They were sweet, delicious, and had a nice touch of viscosity. She\u2019d put them in oil with garlic, then add water and cook them slowly until an emulsified sauce formed. Then a few drops of sherry vinegar for acidity. Those red peppers alone, they deserve a round of applause.With what do you serve this stew of peppers?\u00a0Fried eggs. When people ask me why eggs are so big in Spanish culture, I show them a painting by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, with a woman frying an egg in a terra-cotta bowl over a fire. Show me another culture that has such an amazing painting portraying a woman frying an egg. And eggs with peppers? Believe me: life-changing.Explore Bon App\u00e9titDream Dinner PartyPop CultureInterviewsRead MorecultureBillie Jean King\u2019s Dream Dinner Party Has an Open Door PolicyBy Dawn DaviscultureDirector Barry Jenkins Would Pair Vintage Wine and Soul Food at His Dream Dinner PartyBy Dawn DaviscultureMindy Kaling Would Only Have One Guest at Her Dream Dinner PartyBy Dawn DaviscultureStacey Abrams on the Secret Ingredient to Great CheesecakeBy Dawn DavisRecipes you want to make.
