Transfer to a small bowl and set aside.Step 2Spread out potato chips on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake, tossing halfway through, until deep golden brown, about 5 minutes.Step 3Transfer potato chips to a large bowl and drizzle with oil. Sprinkle reserved spice mixture over and add two-thirds of dill. Finely zest lemon over chips. Sprinkle with lots of black pepper and toss to coat (do all this while the chips are still warm so they absorb the flavors of the spice mixture).

I also didn\u2019t have fresh dill so subbed less dry dill and it was still good, though I definitely want to try again with fresh dill! \n\nAfter making the chips, I also found myself craving a dip for them. I mixed together (all approximate) 1 cup plain Greek yogurt, 2 tbsp capers, 1 tbsp lemon juice, a drizzle of olive oil, some dill, garlic powder, and black pepper and it paired great with the chips! Will definitely make again AnonymousChicago, IL5/3/2020Delicious, easy, will make againAnonymous2/11/2019We loved this!  It turned a bag of chips into a party appetizer.
