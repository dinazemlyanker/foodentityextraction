(Yep, Worcestershire has anchovies in it!)But by contrast to the little fishes that come in tins or jars, anchovy paste is anchovies 2.0. A ground mixture of anchovies, salt, and olive oil (though some brands only feature the first two elements), it comes in a toothpaste-like tube often with a neat retro-looking design. It\u2019s cheap, long-lasting, and a handy shortcut whenever you\u2019re after big flavors but have no time (or anchovies) to spend in the kitchen. It\u2019s also slightly less than salty and, in my opinion, overall more versatile than the tiny cured fish it\u2019s made from.More versatile how? Unlike the more textural fillets of anchovies, this magical paste dissolves easily into any sauce, soup, or dressing, delivering more homogenous results and disguising itself almost completely in the final dish\u2014which is a plus for anyone who\u2019s not so keen on having bits of anchovies in their plate. (And since all you have to do to deploy it is take off the cap and give the tube a squeeze, it's even easier to hide the evidence from the anchovy-averse.)It also spreads easily, which is especially handy for meat. Rub it on a steak with some olive oil before you start cooking and you\u2019ve got a restaurant-quality dish with a killer savory seasoning. Combine it in a marinade with shallots, garlic and lemon juice to slather generously on a roasted leg of lamb and it\u2019ll bring out the meat\u2019s rich, robust flavor. Use it in hearty red meat stews and witness how its saltiness adds character without a hint of fish flavor. Now, try doing that with whole anchovies\u2014not quite the same thing.And then there\u2019s its shelf life. Where jars or cans of anchovies, once opened, tend to lose their freshness if not used soon after, anchovy paste lasts months in the fridge, ready to elevate whatever you\u2019re cooking with just a small squeeze. And I mean small: Because of its concentrated flavor, a little goes a long way, so you\u2019ll rarely need more than a teaspoon or so to lend a big hit of umami energy to just about any dish.Still, the risk of overwhelming your dish\u2014like whole anchovies can sometimes do\u2014is pretty low because anchovy paste doesn\u2019t make your food taste excessively fishy. Instead, it lends it a deeper flavor, boosting the qualities of other ingredients. Because of its more delicate consistency and the fact it blends in so well, the condiment lingers only slightly on the palate (and in turn, your breath).In Italy, where I\u2019m from, anchovy paste is used in a variety of recipes and cooking methods, from the soffritto for pasta e ceci to just about any kind of saut\u00e9ed vegetable. There\u2019s an array of trusted brands that Italians rely on, many of which have been around since the 1800s and feature beautiful old-fashioned packaging: Angelo Parodi, Balena, Agostino Recca (a personal favorite). These sit on the \u201cexpensive\u201d side of your general anchovy paste selection (around $4.50 per tube), but are worth it for their uniform texture, consistency, and spot-on flavor.So, if you\u2019re an anchovy skeptic, let this mellow paste be your first foot into an ocean of flavorful possibilities; if you\u2019re an anchovy enthusiast, save your fancy fillets for when they\u2019ll really count and use the tube for everything else. Either way, anchovy paste deserves a place of honor in your fridge.Explore Bon App\u00e9titcookingRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
