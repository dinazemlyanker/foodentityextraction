Only twenty cases of a single vineyard Riesling made? Hand it over. Sherry lost in a basement for 20 years? Sign me up. But since I\u2019ve been self-isolating, my priorities have changed. Now I\u2019m looking for the most available thing, instead of the rarest. Which is why I\u2019ve been drinking a lot of Victory Brewing Company\u2019s Prima Pils, one of the greatest and most accessible pilsners ever brewed in America.This beer and I first met when I pulled it from a college dorm room fridge, after all the cans of familiar stuff (read cheap, watered-down lager) had disappeared. I had no idea what I was holding when I cracked it open\u2014what \u201ccraft\u201d even meant or what made a Pilsner different from anything else\u2014but it was an instant revelation when I sipped it: Bright and crisp with flavor that was actually, well...there. I credit Prima Pils as the beer that got me into exploring craft beer, and Victory Brewing as the brewery to introduce me (as well as the mass market) to American Belgian-style tripels, sour ales, and double IPAs.Close to a decade since my initial encounter\u2014after drinking tens, hundreds, thousands(?) of them\u2014the flavor still excites me. The European-style hop character, giving spicy, lightly bitter notes of bright lemon rind, flower roots, and fresh cut grass. Pilsner malt that shines through soft and warm, like running your hands through a bucket of grain that\u2019s been sitting in the sun. And most importantly (when it comes to pilsner), a drinking experience that\u2019s crisp and intentional. Sipping it feels like spotting a waterfall on the side of a mountain. It\u2019s a patio beer. It\u2019s a lawnmower beer. It\u2019s a summer beer. It\u2019s a winter beer. It\u2019s a lunch break sipper or an after-work crusher. And yes, it\u2019s a self-isolation beer.And here\u2019s the best part: Chances are you can find it wherever you\u2019re getting your groceries from right now. (And if you can\u2019t, beers like Firestone Walker Pivo Pils or Oskar Blues\u2019 Mamma\u2019s Little Yella Pils are also fantastic and widely distributed.) Knowing I have a few bottles in the fridge means I don\u2019t even miss the small-batch stuff I was drinking when I was still able to run to a craft beer shop, brewery, or bar. Plus, it\u2019s a nice reminder that little, normal things can still make me happy. And that at least some things right now don\u2019t have to change.Buy it: 6 Pack of Victory Prima Pils, from $11 on DrizlyAll products featured on Bonappetit.com are independently selected by our editors.
