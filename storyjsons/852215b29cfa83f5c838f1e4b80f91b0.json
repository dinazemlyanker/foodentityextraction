Give us some substance, please!By Alex DelanyMay 30, 2018FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca JurkevichFacebookTwitterEmailSpindly little asparagus twigs don\u2019t belong on your grill. Or in your oven. Or in that weirdly tall \"asparagus pot\" your mom gave you. We're not sure how people got it into their heads that thin asparagus was the platonic ideal of spring produce, that slim stalks were more tender or delicious or something. But we'd like to go on record and say that you can miss us with the thin stuff. We look at dinky asparagus like that and see a shadow of what this magical vegetable can be. Give us the thick stuff. Give us those fat stalks. Give us Big Asparagus.Because that\u2019s what we love, especially when asparagus is in season and our grills are itching to be fired up. People seem to have the mistaken impression that thick stalks of asparagus are going to be woody or texturally unpleasant, but in reality, when you prep and cook it correctly, thick asparagus is one of the best vegetables around.Here's the problem with thin asparagus: It's not hearty enough to stand up to most high heat cooking techniques. It cooks way too quickly, leaving you practically no room to achieve that perfect crisp-tender level of doneness that you want out of fresh spring veggies. As soon as it hits the grill or a hot pan, those wispy little spears go as limp as noodles, leaving you with something more mushy than tender. Sometimes eating thin asparagus feels like eating, well, nothing at all.Breaking off those bottoms is the pro move.\nThick asparagus can stand up to high heat, allowing enough time for the exterior to take on some color and flavor before the inside reaches a perfect al dente. It holds that distinctive asparagus flavor we love in every crisp, juicy bite. And that woodiness that people complain about? That probably comes from the bottom of the stalks that they\u2019re forgetting to snap off. Asparagus, regardless of thickness, won\u2019t be enjoyable unless you trim it properly, which is stupid easy\u2014just hold the stalk with two hands at the middle and bottom of the stalk and bend it until it snaps. The exact right amount of the tough part will come off every single time.But the best thing about thick asparagus is that it feels like you\u2019re actually eating something. You get big, satisfying bites. It feels like you actually got something for your money. It has physical presence. So next time you\u2019re serving chicken or pork or steak, serve a vegetable with just as much heft. Serve some stalks of the thick stuff.Thick asparagus: also great in a stir-fry.Steak, Snap Pea, and Asparagus Stir-FryYou can probably make it faster than you can say it.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titBasicallyAsparagusVegetableRecipes you want to make.
