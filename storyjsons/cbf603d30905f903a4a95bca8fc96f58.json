Here we harness the wonderful complexity of dried chiles, which simmer with onions, tomatoes, spices, and chicken broth to slowly braise whole chicken legs. Cracking the lid of your cooking vessel helps concentrate the liquid as the chicken cooks. Once the chicken is fall-apart tender, remove it and blend the braising liquid and aromatics into a rich sauce to toss with the shredded meat. Use it to top tostadas or rice bowls, or as a filling for enchiladas and tacos.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high. Working in batches and adding more oil between batches if needed, arrange chicken, skin side down, in pot in a single layer. Cook, undisturbed, until skin is crisp and golden brown, 5\u20137 minutes. Turn over; cook until other side is browned, 5\u20137 minutes. Transfer to a plate.Step 2Reduce heat to medium and combine onion and garlic in same pot; season with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened and starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add cinnamon stick and cumin seeds and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and their juices, crushing with your hands as you go. Cook, stirring occasionally and scraping up any browned bits, until juices are almost completely reduced, 5\u20137 minutes.Step 3Add chiles and 2 cups broth to pot, then chicken (it should be mostly submerged; add remaining broth if needed). Make sure chiles are under chicken so they can fully hydrate. Increase heat to medium-high; bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low, partially cover pot, and simmer 45 minutes. Turn chicken over, scraping up browned bits. Partially cover; cook, scraping up browned bits every 15 minutes, until meat shreds easily and braising liquid is reduced by half to three fourths, 45\u201360 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate; let cool slightly. Remove skin, then shred meat into a medium bowl; discard skin and bones.Step 4Fish out cinnamon stick; discard. Transfer onion, garlic, and chiles to a blender; add \u00bd cup braising liquid. Blend, adding more braising liquid or broth if needed until smooth (sauce should be the consistency of a loose ketchup); season with salt. Add enough sauce to chicken to coat (save extra sauce for another meal).Step 5Spoon chile chicken on tostadas and top with lettuce, red onion, cilantro, and queso fresco. Serve with lime wedges.Do ahead: Chile chicken can be made 4 days ahead.
