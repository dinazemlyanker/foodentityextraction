Except when he\u2019s eating the Z-Man from Joe\u2019s Kansas City Bar-B-Que in his hometown of Kansas City, Kansas. Stacked with brisket, smoked provolone, and onion rings, \u201cit\u2019s a killer sandwich\u2014maybe my favorite in the world,\u201d Rudd raves. He flies them to NYC annually for his fantasy football draft, which this year lined up fortuitously with a new role Rudd needed to gain weight for. \u201cI ate with a clear conscience because I was supposed to be mushy for work.\u201d Here, he talks about just how much he loves that sandwich.I moved to Kansas when I was 10, but I was never a big barbecue fan when I was a kid. My parents are British, so it just wasn\u2019t anything we grew up with. Those great barbecue spots were kind of wasted on me then. But now they\u2019re a much bigger part of my life. Whenever I go back to Kansas City with my kids, which is often, we are always getting barbecue. I was just back there and I think we had barbecue for about four days in a row. It was debilitating. You can\u2019t do it that often.There\u2019s a great sandwich called the Z-Man Sandwich at a spot called Joe\u2019s KC. I think it\u2019s maybe my favorite sandwich in the world. There are different places that do different things\u2014people like LC\u2019s for burnt ends, Jack Stack, Gates, Arthur Bryant\u2019s\u2014but I really crave that Z-Man Sandwich. It\u2019s brisket, and it\u2019s got provolone cheese, onion rings, and barbecue sauce. There are pickles, and you get it with coleslaw. They do seasoned french fries that are pretty outstanding too.I\u2019ve even ordered the sandwiches and had them flown to New York where I live, with the Z-Man Sandwich kits. They send the brisket, and the buns, and the onion rings already kind of already pre-made. And then you heat it up and assemble it when you get it. I host a fantasy football draft with all my buddies, and so I started ordering the sandwiches every year for our draft at the end of summer. There are a couple other guys in the league that are from Kansas City. They\u2019re especially excited because they know about the place already.I just got this Big Green Egg and a book of Big Green Egg recipes. I\u2019m really looking forward to trying to figure out how to use it, because I want to be one of \u201cthose guys.\u201d I\u2019d like to be really good at mixing drinks, at making things in a smoker, in a Big Green Egg, and all that stuff. My kids make fun of me because I just sit in front of the computer and watch Big Green Egg YouTube videos. Maybe once I really get it down, I\u2019ll be able to make my own version of the Z-Man Sandwich.Explore Bon App\u00e9titBarbecueKansas CityCelebritiesRead MoreLifestyleWe Cooked Cacio e Pepe With Kiernan Shipka and Had a Very Fun TimeBy Ali FranciscultureI Don\u2019t Care What You Say, Bread Is The Most Important Part of a MealBy Paul W.
