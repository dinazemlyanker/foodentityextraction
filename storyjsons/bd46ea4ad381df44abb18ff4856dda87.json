After a tedious day there\u2019s nothing that heals my soul more than making dessert into the late hours of the night while New Girl reruns play in the background. But some recipes are better candidates for a stress-baking session than others. The techniques employed must induce joy and offer a hefty return on investment. Kneading milk bread dough? Therapeutic. Folding egg whites into a chiffon cake? Pure catharsis. Pressing cold butter with my hot hands into flaky pie dough? Yeah, not so much. For that reason, pie has just never been something I turn to when I\u2019m trying to relax. Because let\u2019s face it, pie crusts\u2014arguably the best part of any pie\u2014are finicky and technical, requiring just the right touch and a carefully-followed recipe. I never thought I\u2019d see the day where baking a pie brought me peace and good vibes only\u2014that is, until I gave Samantha Seneviratne\u2019s slab pie a chance.I can hear you thinking, \u201cslab pie\u2026?\u201d Just imagine a Pop-Tart as vast as your sheet pan, but made with decadent, flaky pie crust instead of the crumbly processed stuff. Straightforward and stress-free, it\u2019s as if this recipe was designed for bakers, like myself, who feel like they\u2019d been personally victimized by pie dough in the past. Upon learning that the dough comes together in a food processor, I exhaled a resounding sigh of relief and watched as a butter-studded dough came together in just a few minutes. No fuss pie crust? I was sold.The second best thing about this crust is how unbelievable the filling tastes with it. Sam\u2019s ingenious blackberry and apricot filling has no chance of sogging up the pie because it\u2019s pre-cooked and utilizes dried apricots rather than fresh ones. They\u2019re the key to this fruity pie\u2019s supple and, well, apricot-y flavor that you simply cannot achieve with the fresh ones. And now that I\u2019ve been enlightened, I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.The recipe calls for cooking the chopped dried apricots in a bath of dry white wine, a vanilla bean, and its scraped seeds. (Since I don\u2019t drink alcohol, I used grapefruit juice instead.) Bath and Body Works should bottle the aroma that filled my house as vanilla commingled with the fruit. Heaven! Once the dried fruit was plump and saucy, blackberries joined and offered their puckery juices to the party. Lucky for me, the recipe yielded more than enough fruit filling for me to sneak in as many \u201cjust a little taste\u201d bites as my heart desired.The assembly was a no-brainer. Crust, filling, crust. And a fork to seal the sides shut. No lattice? No problem. (Just remember to cut a few vents on the top layer of pie dough to prevent Mount Blackberry from erupting.)Once baked and cooled, I prepared to offer the finished pie to my husband and his group of very hungry friends. But once I snuck myself a bite of warm crust painted with apricot-blackberry sauce, I shamelessly bailed on all my plans to share. The crust had baked to golden brown perfection and was sturdy enough to hold the heaps of fruit filling in place\u2014even as I walked around my apartment with a slice in hand. When I asked Sam how she landed on her impeccable crust to filling ratio, she told me she believes that \u201cthe crust is as big a player as the filling.\u201d Retweet, Sam, retweet. Now that I have these pie tricks up my sleeve, I\u2019m proud to announce that my \u201cSweets to Make When Stressed\u201d Google doc now hyperlinks this slab pie recipe right at the top.Get the recipe:Blackberry and Dried Apricot Slab PieA craveable, shareable, crowd-pleasing pie for every summer picnic and party.View RecipeRecipes you want to make.
