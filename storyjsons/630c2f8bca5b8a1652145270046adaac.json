Check for seasoningMy feeling about meh food is that the number one culprit is usually underseasoning. Obviously, I\u2019m the salt queen and I would say that, but I really do think that home cooks aren\u2019t liberal enough with their seasoning. So the first move always is to add a little bit of salt. Take a spoonful aside, add a little salt to that spoonful. If that unlocks more flavor, then you\u2019ve solved your problem. Go ahead, salt the entire dish\u2014or move on to step 2.While it seems like I use a lot of salt, I\u2019m actually seasoning as I cook in small incremental amounts\u2014you can always add salt, but you can\u2019t take it away. If you were to season a soup only when it\u2019s finished cooking and ready to be served, it\u2019ll register as salty because the salt has not yet penetrated all of the ingredients (it\u2019s suspended in the broth, but not inside any of the vegetables). If you season often, and season early, the salt will have a chance to get absorbed and the dish will taste seasoned versus salty. I\u2019m tasting my food right up until the last minute and adjusting the seasoning accordingly.Molly\u2019s Blistered Cheesy Peppers get topped with vinegary shallots to cut through the cheesy fat.\nPhoto by Molly Baz2. Taste for balanceTake a bite and ask yourself, What is the prevailing flavor profile you\u2019re tasting? Is it overpowering? What ingredients do you wish you could taste more (or less)? What can you do to accentuate or diminish that flavor? Could you balance the flavors with a bit more of an ingredient already present in the dish? What other flavor profile could you introduce to modify the flavor and steer it in a more delicious direction? If it\u2019s a slow-cooked dish or a deeply roasty-toasty one, could you introduce something fresh to balance those deeper cooked notes?Refer to the ingredients list in the recipe you\u2019re cooking. The first step is always adding more of the ingredients that are in it already, to bring the dish into better balance before you start looking outside for other stuff to throw on top. Look within the dish before you look outward.Here\u2019s an example. In the book, there\u2019s a recipe for Coconut Shrimp with Chickpeas and Basil. The first version I made when developing this recipe was overly fatty and rich (coconut milk will do that), and the final dish tasted bland. To fix it, I bumped up the sambal and added honey to balance out some of the fat and spice with sweetness. A big squeeze of lime brought out all of the already-present flavors even more.3. Assess for textureFlavor is not one-dimensional\u2014it\u2019s not just about how something tastes but also about mouthfeel and the eating experience at large. When you\u2019re adding ingredients to make a dish taste better, consider what they\u2019re bringing to the table texturally, and not just flavor-wise.Ask yourself: Is the dish feeling uni-textural? Could it use a little contrast? What quick-fix items do you have on hand that might add some dimension? Crack open your pantry and search for nuts, seeds, croutons, breadcrumbs, crackers, chips, and other highly textural sprinkle-y things that often solve the prob (that\u2019s where all the sprinkle-y bits in my book come in). But texture doesn\u2019t just mean adding crunch, it can also mean slippery things and chewy things, or something tender and soft. Maybe your soup needs a silky soft-boiled egg, or your salad a squeaky cheese like Halloumi.Soft lentils, meet fried bread.\nPhoto by Alex Lau, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich4. Get a second opinion (if you can), make adjustments, and carry onIt also helps to have a sounding board. Having a second opinion (my husband) who can step outside of the dish and eat it without any emotional attachment is incredibly valuable. So if you\u2019re not sure if a dish needs more salt, more honey, some texture, or whatever, ask whomever you\u2019re cooking for! I\u2019m sure they have thoughts.\u2026When all else fails, the condiments I\u2019m turning to the most right now are sour cream (it\u2019s fatty and really tangy at the same time\u2014people don\u2019t give it enough credit) and the perfect chile crisp by The Spicy Mamas. I put it on every rice bowl, egg dish, and vegetable and just call it a day. Add enough of that to your accidentally dried-out fillet of salmon and no one will be the wiser.Get the book!Cook This Book: Techniques That Teach and Recipes to Repeat$32 $20 at Amazon$30 at BookshopAdapted from \u2018Cook This Book.\u2019 Copyright \u00a9 2021 by Molly Baz.
