Using pecans in the romesco sauce isn\u2019t traditional, but adds a subtle nutty creaminess that pairs wonderfully with the smoked Gouda stuffed inside each crispy ball. The meatballs can also be made with ground beef, veal, chicken, or pork instead of the lamb.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

After making it 3 times, I feel the meatballs do not need the stuffed piece of smoked gouda cheese. Not only does the cheese not always melt properly but it's kind of over-kill as there is a lot of smoked paprika in both. Serve with linguini, parsley, garlic, oil....salad....vino.  Tip: make sauce day before.Anonymouscalifornia2/28/2022Excellent flavor and consistency. Cooking in butter gives such a good taste to the meatballs. I did not have zucchini and mushrooms so I used spinach instead. MichaelLiberty Lake, WA10/20/2021Explore Bon App\u00e9titMeatballLambMeatPecanNutRecipes you want to make. Cooking advice that works.
