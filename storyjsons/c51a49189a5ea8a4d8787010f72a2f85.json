ArnettApril 16, 2019FacebookTwitterEmailPhoto by Cody JamesFacebookTwitterEmailWelcome to Red Sauce America, our coast-to-coast celebration of old-school Italian-American restaurants.When I meet women on dating apps, I always want to know if I can take them to the Olive Garden, my treat. It\u2019s a solid opener; a way to know if we\u2019re compatible. If they\u2019re the right kind of woman for me, they\u2019ll respond with an enthusiastic yes.The right kind of woman for me is someone who won\u2019t give me a hard time about the things I like. The kind of woman who will let me pocket all the leftover breadsticks and doesn\u2019t care if we only discuss our favorite sexual positions and what kind of appetizers look best off the limited-time-only menu. We\u2019re at Olive Garden because it\u2019s kitschy and cute. Nothing that happens needs to be a serious thing. It\u2019s no big deal.Many people don\u2019t know that Olive Garden began in 1982 as an independent restaurant in the Greater Orlando area. As a local who\u2019s obsessed with talking and writing about Florida, I guess it makes sense that it\u2019s a restaurant I\u2019d frequent. The one I go to isn\u2019t actually the original, but they\u2019re all very much the same kinda place: same menu, same \u201990s-style carpets, same matching uniforms on the waitstaff.At Olive Garden, the good times are as limitless as the free salad and breadsticks.\nPhoto by Cody JamesThere\u2019s something comforting about the fact that my Olive Garden is located in the neighborhood where I grew up. It\u2019s where my evangelical family and I used to eat together before we stopped speaking. Before I came out, before I stopped going to church, before I held them accountable for all the ways they\u2019d silenced important parts of me. So yeah, Olive Garden reminds me of my family, which is painful, but it also reminds me of home\u2014at least, an idea of what home could be: a never-changing place that isn\u2019t ever going to foist anything new upon me. And there\u2019s a Michaels across the parking lot, so after dinner, if I\u2019m tipsy from my wines, plural, I can walk over and look at art supplies, which is always a very good time.What I\u2019m saying is: I go to Olive Garden to chill out and avoid the problems in my life.We\u2019re seated. Would you like some wine, I ask. I always want wine. What kind of wine do you like, she\u2019ll ask, and I\u2019ll smile and tell her I can\u2019t tell the difference. All wines taste the same to me. But if we don\u2019t tell our server that, we\u2019ll get unlimited free samples. And I am all about unlimited free samples. Oh look, here come the breadsticks! Also free.Two people eating means you get three sticks total. I like to think Olive Garden did that on purpose, so that you\u2019re forced to break bread with your date. You must share with each other, touch hands. It\u2019s all very romantic, if romance is deciding who gets to take the bigger share of the carbs. Also, if I eat my first breadstick quick enough, I can pick up the second one before my date even notices it\u2019s missing.All around us, families are sitting down together to eat and discuss their days. They\u2019re talking about what the kids did at school, or maybe deciding what they\u2019re gonna do as a family over the weekend. I myself am having dinner with a complete stranger I met on the internet, so I skip all the warm-hearted intimacy and jump straight into a terrible stand-up comedy routine. One night I made a pun so bad that a woman actually took out her phone and unmatched me right there at the table.Can you believe my boss did that? she asked at the end of a long story I wasn\u2019t fully listening to. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it pasta!\u201d I replied. Date over.I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m expecting to get from these outings. Despite the fact that when-you\u2019re-here-you\u2019re-family, I\u2019m not looking to settle down with any of the women I bring to Olive Garden. In fact, I know that after we make out in the parking lot or hook up at her apartment, I\u2019ll never see her again.But I like the routine of it. The fact that I don\u2019t have to try so hard. Even if conversation lags, Olive Garden gives you opportunities to engage. I mean, they bring you a salad you\u2019ve gotta serve yourself. So I take the tongs and mix everything around for a good while and then ask my date what she likes best. I don\u2019t like olives so I\u2019m always hoping she does, and I\u2019m always hoping she loathes tomatoes so I can snag them. After the meal is through, the server brings out the check and tosses a fistful of Andes mints on the table. If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ll make a joke about us being \u201cmint to be\u201d and the woman will be so disgusted with you that she\u2019ll just let you take all of them for yourself. Olive Garden never changes and apparently neither do I.I can\u2019t tell if I want to.I pay the check. It\u2019s the least I can do. Then we walk out into the balmy Florida night, full of sauce and carbs and wine, and I\u2019m ready to go home alone and think about all the weird things we saw happen in the restaurant, like that kid who crawled under several different tables and untied everyone\u2019s shoelaces.Maybe the date could have turned into something bigger if I hadn\u2019t made it so it couldn\u2019t possibly. Maybe I could\u2019ve rolled the dice on sustainable companionship if I weren\u2019t so terrified of it backfiring. Maybe. But here\u2019s what I do know: If I ask nicely enough, the restaurant will give me a packet of my very own warm breadsticks to take home. On the house. And if that\u2019s not intimacy, I don\u2019t know what is.Kristen Arnett is an essay and fiction writer based in Orlando, Florida.
