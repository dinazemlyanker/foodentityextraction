There\u2019s something uniquely comforting about the combination of carbohydrates and warm, salty cheese-adjacent substances. When I\u2019m hit with a wave of nostalgia, this is what I crave.My love of snack foods runs deep, but since I don\u2019t always enjoy the feeling after eating loads of them (which isn\u2019t to say that you won\u2019t find several varieties of salty, crispy snacks in my kitchen, always), I\u2019ve developed a parallel passion for re-creating less-processed versions of my favorites. Over the years, it\u2019s become something of a hobby to figure out how to turn the stash of ingredients in my pantry\u2014vegan staples like nutritional yeast, coconut oil, and vital wheat gluten\u2014into the closest approximations possible. Often, the results are both better and more satisfying than their inspirations.On one recent night at home (of course), I was struck with an acute need to have this gooey, salty \u201cplastic cheese\u201d on the twice-baked potatoes I was planning to make for dinner. So I decided to doctor up something like it with what I had on hand. While plant-based cheese sauces are not a new idea, this one requires absolutely zero planning. No soaking the cashews overnight, no cooking and mashing a starchy orange vegetable, no preservatives or emulsifiers. It takes 15 minutes, start to finish, and can be adapted and applied in countless ways.Here\u2019s how to make vegan cheese:Start by soaking \u00bd cup cashews in hot water for 10 minutes, then drain and add them to a blender with 3 Tbsp. nutritional yeast, 1 Tbsp. red miso, 1 tsp. turmeric, and 5 Tbsp. water, plant-based milk, vegetable stock, or even pasta water (that salty-starchy bath is ideal). I like to add \u00bd tsp. garlic powder, \u00bd tsp. hot paprika, and a few dashes of liquid smoke to spice things up. Blend this mixture until it\u2019s very smooth (I use an immersion blender when I\u2019m too lazy to break out my Ninja), and \u201ccheese\u201d is ready.I like to spread it cold, on crackers, or eat it warm\u2014as a dip with pretzel nuggets or fries, slathered on plant-based burgers, drizzled over roasted veggies. I\u2019ll stir in chopped jalape\u00f1os or Hatch chiles for a spicy variation that works perfectly with chips, tacos, or as a base for mac and cheese. Or sometimes I\u2019ll add diced pimientos, cayenne, and veganaise and then pop it in the fridge for a pimiento cheese spread that makes a mean sandwich. When I\u2019m feeling more on the healthy side, it\u2019s the perfect addition to my crudit\u00e9s platter too.Is this vegan cheese sauce a 1:1 substitute for the \u201cplastic cheese\u201d my nostalgia brain wanted? Well, not exactly. While it doesn\u2019t have the same odd stretchy texture as the kind of thing you\u2019d find in a plastic tub with a peel-off foil lid, it\u2019s packed with about 10 times as much flavor\u2014and it\u2019s every bit as comforting.VC\u2019s time to shine:Mixed Nut and Seed CrackersThese crackers are gluten-free, Paleo, vegan.....and Whole30.View RecipeExplore Bon App\u00e9titCheeseVeganHealthyishRecipes you want to make.
