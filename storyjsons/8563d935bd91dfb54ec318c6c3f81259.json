A crunchy mixture of toasted nuts and seeds provides pops of texture and spice, and a cooling lemony yogurt sauce cuts through the richness. Don't skip charring the lemons\u2014it's not just a cute party trick: Caramelizing the sugars tames some of the acidity even as the juice remains fresh and bright. Plus, you'll use that lemon-infused oil to crisp the nuts. Arrange the sweet potatoes on a platter and serve with bread, pita, or crunchy vegetables, like carrots and radishes, for swiping up any leftover yogurt.\u00a0All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

I\u2019m not a big fan of sweet potatoes, but I loved the creaminess and sourness of the yogurt. I also added more red paper flakes bc I love spicy food. This is a must try. Erika RenataSan Antonio, TX1/24/2022TastyAnonymous11/16/2021Delicious! I made it without the lemons/yogurt just based on what I had on-hand. The sesame seeds are clutch.JSChicago, IL4/19/2021I added some ground sausage to this dish and served it with a side of cheesy grits. Yum! I know that takes out all the healthiness, but I felt like this dish needed something just a bit more savory. I've also been using the leftovers to make a breakfast hash in the morning and it works great. I'd definitely make this again, and I super recommend adding in some sausage to heat things up a bit.LTDenton, TX12/11/2020Can I substitute ricotta cheese instead of yogurt? I made this recipe before and absolutely loved it but I don\u2019t want to have to go to the store just for yogurt lol. I also have sour cream and Mayo. What would you suggest?KLynamSouth bend IN11/25/2020Can I use ricotta instead of yogurt ? Kayla LSouth bend Indiana 11/25/2020This recipe is delicious! We all loved it - the flavor and texture combo is perfect and I now love this method of cooking sweet potatoes. I put parchment paper under the potato halves to keep from sticking AnonymousLouisville 11/21/2020Unfortunately this really wasn\u2019t a win for me. It took a while longer for the sweet potatoes to char than expected and they stuck to the pan horribly (not BA\u2019s fault, just a warning) and then while they themselves were quite tasty neither the yogurt nor crunchies wowed any of us. Now, caveat, I didn\u2019t have fennel or cumin seeds so I used a much reduced portion of each, ground. The dish wasn\u2019t terrible we certainly ate it but all wanted it to be either more savory or sweet and this seemed like not quite enough of either. The yogurt seemed kind of bland, I think it might\u2019ve benefited from a little bit of sugar. The flavor combos here just weren\u2019t gelling for us but I do like the concept and the different textures. BananaMartiniElkins Park, PA 11/4/2020This was so simple and delicious! Perfectly balanced. This will definitely be a weekday regular for me. Thanks, Molly!AnonymousDenver, CO5/21/2020Served this over mixed greens for dinner - super yum!AnonymousNashville 4/15/2020Made as written. Excellent dish. \nFlavors were well balanced, easy to put together.iz2Duvall, WA4/7/2020I loved the picture and wanted to try the recipe.  By the time I got around to it over the holidays my Greek yogurt had expired and I realized I had 2 pounds of sweet potatoes but only two separate ones...so the cooking took longer - the charring is a great clue to doneness.  I replaced the yogurt with mostly sour cream with a little bit of mayo to top up to 1/2 cup and then 1/2 c of whipping cream that I turned into buttermilk.  Even with all these changes, the flavour of this was outstanding!  Presentation was excellent and the dish got rave reviews.  The nut mix added so much depth/complexity of flavour.  Thanks for including the photo - showed what you meant by \"coarse chopped hazelnuts\".  LOVED this dish.AnonymousCalgary, Alberta12/31/2019Amazinggggg!!! So well balanced. That crispy spice nut mix is to die for - I\u2019ll be making more to top yogurt bowls and salads! The browned butter adds so much depth of flavor. \n\nWe made this with carrots and it was a star dish.
